During the past year of depression, many people who once had money
enough to foolishly squander on Made-to-Order Boots, have been in the habit
of buying at MARK FOY’S, OXFORD STREET, SYDNEY,

Annreciate the change. Formerly, when measured for their boots, they felt
obliged to take them, whether comfortable or not. But at MARK FOY’S they find such endless variety in Makes
and Sizes, Fittings and Shapes, that they walk right home in the boots they buy.

HISTORICAL DEATH-BEDS.
A pleasant essay (if one had time—and
science, in whose pursuit we spend our
time, unfairly robs us of the hope of com-
pensating eternity) might be made out of
historical death-beds—not the beds them-
selves, but the way historians have treated
them. For example, take the death of
Philip II. of Spain, from a recent article in
Temple Bar :—
And so little by little life flickered, and then
faded out, and silently Philip If. passed into the
land of shadows at 5 a.m., when the da* u was
just breaking, and w T hile the choir-boys or the
seminary were chanting the Mass of Nations He
died on September 13, 1598, on the same day that,
14 years before, the last stone had been laid to the
Eseo'-ial. Philip II. departed this life , aged 72,
hav ing miserably misgovei ned Spain for 43 years.
Here’s a rhetorician who is artful (witness his
allusions to thd ehoir-buys and the Escorial)
but not able—ft is decidedly awkward to
kill poor Philip thrice in three ways in three
sentences. And the “5 a.m.” lacks dignity,
and the last sentence is horribly tagged on,
and even the sounding “miserably mis-
governed ” might be cavilled at.
Compare,this with another recent death-
bed—Mary, Queen of Scots’ (how inevitably
those four words seem to rattle off), in Mrs.
Maxwell Scott’s “ Tragedy of Fotheringay ’:
The queen, who was seated on her stool, un-
bound, and still bolding her crucifix, raised bar
head and stretched out her,neck, thinking she was
to be beheaded with a sword, according to the
privilege granted in France to royal pe sons.
“ vly God, ' she said fervent ly, “ I have hoped in
Thee; t give back my soul into Thy hands.”
■ The executioners, seeing her mistake, assisted
her to rise, and conducted bar to the
block, where they made he.- kneel down,
and as she knelt upright, still thinking
she was to be beheaded with the sword, they
made her lie fiat, with her head on the low block,,
o.i yaiew inches high. .As the queen repeated
the Words “ ) irte Domine speravi,” Lord Shrews-
bury raised his wand to give the fatal signal. The
e ecutionoi* lifted the axe, but stopped at a sign
fr i.u his assstant, who had perceived that the
q icen, to enable herself to breathe, had placed her
hands unde her chin. Mary continued to pray
aloud, and in the deep silence that reigned in the
hall she could be heard repeating the verse, “In
mantis tuas Domine conunendo.’ These were her
last w/ds. The executioner, affected, perhaps,
by sympathy and by the general emotion visible
among the bystanders, struck with an ill-assured
aim and only wounded the queen severely, but
she neither moved nor made a sound. At the
blow the soul of Mary Stuart passed to its eternal
reward. 0
This is a plain, straightforward picture,
not particularly impressive. “Reward”
simply means that Mrs. Scott has succumbed
(unlike Fronde) to the glamour of the most
fascinating woman in history, and that her
mat d ials have been chiefly drawn from the
diary of Dominique Bourgoing", Mary’s last
physician.
And so one might quote Motley’s death of
Egiuout : and Macaulay’s execution of Mon-
mouth (with the splendid reference to West-
minster Abbey, and the cunning clinching
sentence, “ Such was the dust with which
the dust of Monmouth mingled”); and
many similar descriptions, with considerable
literary interest and profit in the comparison.

SOME RECENT BOOKS.
Longfellow’s “complete poetical works”
are given in the new Cambridge edition (4s.
3d.), which can be recommended as the best
issued at the price. The text is a reprint of
that of the Riverside edition, and only the
notes are omitted. Of these, however, a
very full appendix collects the most valuable.
A “Life of Nelson” in the “English
Men of Action ’’ series (3s. lOd.) is a com-
pact and capable little biography.
Airs. Cafiyn’s new book, “ A Comedy of
Spasms” (Is. 9d.), is decidedly her best
work so far - , though it makes her limita-
tions still clearer. But it is more
natural than “A Yellow Aster,” more
interesting than “Children of Circum-
stance,” and (crowning merit !) much
shorter than either . The sex-problems
round which the story gravitates do
indeed begin to grow tiresome, and there is
no novelty in the treatment and no strength
in the climax But the book is readable,
and there are here and there observations
and criticisms which have merit enough to
be worth remembering for a week or two.
The heroine is an Australian girl, and “ she
runs amuck in the husband line—duesn t
know what she wants until it’s too late ’—and
then settles down to endurance mainly be-
cause the terlinm quid is too honorable or too
foolish-to encourage her to revolt.
“ Anyway, she’ll never, in any circumstances,
look defeated.”
“ Defeated ! ”
“ Haven’t > ou noticed the look on scores of the
faces of quite fairly-intelligent, God-fearing Eng-
lish girls ? It makes me sick. Yet it’s disgust-
ingly pathetic. They have never had the chance
to become of significance, with all the capacity for
significance lying dormant in them and crying
aloud for satisfaction and an audience. There s
one thing worse, however, that tragic, striving-to-
please air; it attacks ’em at about thirty-nine ;
you see it in that perennial hungry smile, and a
patient attempt to hide the gold in their teeth fil-
lings. I am always inclined to beg the woman to
go to her room, take off her smile, and rest in a
nice padded dressing-gown with her toes on the
fender. A proper appreciation of comfort is the
basis of a sound morality ; it rounds the angles of
your neighbors, and is better than charity as a
cloak for their sins.”
This gives a fair glimpse of the conversa-
tion in “ A Comedy of Spasms.”
NOTES.
“ It is the poets who save the language
from decay, and who keep high the standard
of literary excellence,” writes Edmund
Gosse in the North American Review.
Now we know in what category to place the
anomalous bush bard. He’s a literary anti-
septic.
“Of all the romances that have come to
hand since New Year’s Day the present
reviewer ” —a Saturday Review writer—
“failing a Stanley Weyman, would not
trouble himself to walk three yards to rescue
any from destruction, save only * Almayer’s
Folly,’ ‘ The Martyred Fool,’ ‘ A Business in
Great Waters,’ and ‘ When Valmond Came
to Pontiac. ’” And none of those takes
higher than second-class rank. Literature
nowadays is a hurry-scurry for dollars, and a
“popular” author cannot give quality as
well as quantity.
Apropos our “ erotic - nehrotic - tonlmy-
rotic ” literary era, Bryce M‘Master prints
this sonnet in Land. Chronicle
La Decadence.
Sing the sweet Age of Right the only Wrong !

To Correspondent.— B. Ray ; The Twain-
Hartc rivalry is only a less important repetition
of that between Dickens and Thackeray—emotion
v. intellect. The emotional writer commands a
huge audiencp than the intellectual, yet, even in
the midst of plaudits, he has an uneasy feeling
that his vi ork stands on a lower literary plane.
Bret Harte’s later works harp rather feebly on
monotonous strings, „ but his early stuff has a
power and brilliance that Mark Twain, with all
his merit, never rivalled. Humorous compression,
too, has more of the quality of permanence than
humorous expansion.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in .allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should bo without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“We, theundersigned, have had occasion toobtain
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis- My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known ; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
—Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong,”
“Dear Sir, —I had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it,—Yours faithfully, J. H, WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Elsternwick.”

WTfOls trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, fee.,

restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.

TIRXKrB: i
A DISEASE, not a CRIME.
The constant abuse of alcohol fosters a crave
a crave insatiable and deadly. It deprives valu-
able men of all reason and respect; it drives them
to acts of indecency and crime, and to drink what
their palates may even repel. At this stage
pledges and punishment prove useless, and
physical, as well as mental attention, is urgently
required.
The Orient Institute
has established a wonderful reputation in the
curing of this awful disease, and, during the past
18 months, many prominent men of our colony
have been restored to health, sobriety and
position. Alcoholic stimulants become not only
unnecessary, but, in the majority of cases, un-
palatable. Patients undergo no inconvenience or
restraint, and are free to eat and drink what they
like.
UNQUESTIONABLE TESTIMONY.
“ I had heard of the excellent results attending your
work, and was thereby induced to send my friend to you.
The results have exceeded my most sanguine expectations.
For the previous live years he has always been under the
influence of alcohol and gradually losing power to resist
it. Since he has been under your treatment a marvellous
change has been wrought in him. Not only does he
appear to be thoroughly cured of drinking, but his
appearance, which had been degenerating, has improved,
and his color is healthy and bright. In short, the man
seems not only to have been purged of disease, but also
renewed mentally and physically.”
R. M. Mo. ANDERSON, 38 Pitt-St.
“ I sent a gentleman to Mr. Thomas for treatment in
April, 1894—about the worst case I ever knew—and the
effects have been most wonderful.”
ARCHDEACON LANGLEY.
“In the ease of a gentleman whom I recommended
to the Orient for treatment of dipsomania (May, 1894),
the cure was both rapid and lasting.”

There is always a demand for LACE; there
has been since L ACE was first made, and there
will be as long as L ACE is. And LACE is a very
different thing from what it used to be. The
equivalent of LACE that used to cost a big round
sum may now be had for a few shillings, and
ladies “ so dispoged,” as Mrs. Gamp puts it, may
cover themselves and their families with LACE
for less than a cuff or a collar used to cost.
AN OLD WRITER of the Sixteenth Century,

“Our English dames are much given to the wear-
ing of costly laces ; and if they be brought from
Italy they are in great esteem.’'

(A reply to “Wyvis,” BULLETIN, 10/8/1895.)
To drivel no religious consolation
Take I the pen ; no gods or creeds I own,
No ghostly faitli supplies my inspiration,
No rnetaphysic lore of things unknown.
This much I know : I live 1 and all things being
Join for my life, live in my thought, my act;
One dust-mote strikes the sea—the ripples fleeing
Speed to Infinity : who notes this fact
Knows that all things, all thought, all time, all
space,
Live in him now, and he in them doth blend
Each moment. Lo ! his universal race
Changes in form and sense, but has no end !
Think not I speak of atoms only. Life
Is force that works—not the mere tool of clay.
All works to all. The Universe is rife
With vital impresses, new-born each day,
Creating, as created. I must die
In form and sense, but form and sense live yet,
Shaped from my past. Enough it is that I
Do well, to better these. Ido forget
The babe that once I was ; it knew not me ;
Dead are its flesh, its form, its sense; yet say,
Was it in vain the vanished babe should be,
Shaping the man who lives and joys to-day ?
Enough ! So learn, life is a thing of splendor,
And even suffering holds a keener joy ;
The very voice of your despair may render
Wisdom to others for their strength’s employ.
In such, you live, rejoicing. Feeling this,
Who can despair ? I know no fears or pains
But of the moment, and my reasoned bliss
Firm, undismayed, invincible remains
Within the higher thought. Quit gloomy dream-
ing !
Up, play the man ! and with the evil cope!
Read upon Nature’s path the signpost gleaming—
“ Hope lives for all but those who will not
hope! ”

Good ! good ! good ! is the leaf that gives the food,
And the bloom that makes the crown.
Close ! close ! close ! we nestle and we doze,
Thralled behind our leafy bars ;
Close ! close ! close ! while the silver moon arose,
And her sickle reaped the silver stars.
Kiss ! kiss ! kiss ! All time’s the time for this—
Tho’ a leaf-breath make the timid hen to start.
Kiss ! kiss ! kiss ! Other seasons are amiss ;
People in this season never part.
Fine! fine! fine! is the black wood-bloom as wine—
We sip it with a down-hung head ;
Fine ! fine ! fine ! is the tree that bids us dine,
The tree wherein we drink, and make our bed.
Sway ! sway ! sway ! lazy-winged the long noon-
day,
We hang upon the wind-swept bough ;
Sway ! sway ! sway ! Scent of honey and of hay—
And there is no other day but now.
Wed ! wed ! wed ! we’ll make our marriage-bed
Here among the blaokwood’s tumbled bloom!
Wed ! wed ! wed ! and its sips of nectar shed
Shall diamond the wainscots of our room.
Wed ! wed ! wed ! For 0, my love
Couches for the lives that are to come ;
Wed! wed! wed! Pile the pillows for her head —
The head of her who makes the house a home.
Fine ! fine ! fine ! for the world is all a-shine,
And all the joy of nesting just begun.
Fine ! fine ! fine ! are the eggs of yours and mine,
And their beauty lies a-speckling in the sun.
True ! true ! true ! are the eggs of me and you—
True shall all the egg-born be ;
And the time has come to love, and the time has
come to do,
And fine is all the world and free.
“Tweet! tweet! tweet!” from the withered
blossom sweet —
Summer now has vanquished spring.
“ Tweet! tweet! tweet 1 ” O, we bring you first
food, fleet
As the summer airs the summer leafage fling !
“ Tweet! tweet ! tweet ! ” In this nest the
seasons meet —
Spring and summer, autumn—all in one :
“ Tweet! tweet! tweet! ” in the hazy summer
heat
Love and we our task have almost done.
Sway ! sway ! sway ! Through this summer of a
day !
Life was made for work and love and dreams.
True ! true ! true ! may your lover be to you,
Mild the air and bland the noon-day beams !
Good ! good! good ! is the golden world and
wood :
This chrome-crowned spring shall be the only
one !
Fine! fine! fine ! And we drink the world like
wine,
And preen our wings, and laugh full at the sun!

farmers will send their stuff, which will be re-
ceived by a recognised official and distributed to
European hawkers, whose rounds will be so
defined as not to clash with one another. If any
scheme is workable enough to cope with cheap
John, this one will; but the difficulty will be in
the white man “coming down” to take a

WE beg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,

Ginter’s Straight-out No. 1,” “Cameo’’and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “Pure Gold ” and “Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by

We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the nterest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated

And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in

The above is, of course, a caricature of the famous American national picture, which will be
given later on.
“YANKEE DOODLE ” is everywhere spoken of as the finest plug-tobacco that has ever
appeared here, and it has won greater success during the short time it has been on the market than
anything previously. This is no idle boast, and, to prove it, any smoker can test the statement, for
there are few towns in N.S.W. where “YANKEE DOODLE” is not known and sold. Its sale
has this year increased nearly one hundred (100) per cent over that of last year. And why is this?
Simply that “YANKEE DOODLE” has struck the popular taste. In the first place, it comes, after
years of careful study, from a combination of certain choice Virginian tobaccos, so blended and
exquisitely flavoured, that any smoker who can stand a tobacco heavier than the pure gold-leaf is
forced to admit that he has at last discovered something far and away better than anything he has
been accustomed to. DIXSON & SONS have taken over half-a-century to accomplish this; and, as
their leading business has been built up on their reputation for QUALITY, they could not afford to
make the foregoing statement if any doubt existed. DIXSON & SONS, who use more American leaf
than all the other Tobacco Factories combined, are noted for several high-class brandsCON-
QUEROR,” “ SIR ROGER,” “ CHAMPION,” and “DOLLAR;” but “YANKEE DOODLE'
ranks supreme.

The Curse of Labor Legislation.
Investors who have sunk their money in New Zealand
have very little to be thankful for. However, we can
take a lesson which should be a salutary one not to risk
capita) in countries where representatives of labor have
command of the helm The Bank of New Zealand
ought to have been one of the strongest banks in the
colonies, but when you place men in the position of law-
makers whose only idea is to reduce everything to a com-
mon or uniform level, the consequences are not difficult
to foretell.— Thompson’s Stock and Shave Report, Sydney
I was through New Zealand 16 years ago. .... But it
struck me that people are not now as happy as they were
in those days, and that, I think, is owing to the Legisla-
ture of the country .... the best franchise in vogue in
the colonies is that of Tasmania, where a man has no vote
unless he earns a certain mimimum wage per annum.
I have no objection to women who have a stake in the
country being granted the franchise, but I do not agree
with the one-woman-one-vote idea The country
has not fulfilled the great future I anticipated for it 16
years ago. . . . Man alone is trying to ruin it. ... Par-
liament consists of paid members. . . . I have returned
stronger than ever in the belief that an unpaid Parliament
is the most perfect form of n presentative government.—
Frederic Villiers, Anglo-Choiu-Jap war artist.
The two extracts quoted above are interest-
ing as representing the average reasoning
process of the very average human being.
The ordinary Tory—and most Tories are
painfully ordinary—travels on the simple
and beautiful assumption that every disaster
which falls on a country governed upon
Liberal principles is the natural and inevi-
table result of those principles, and every
disaster which befalls a country governed on
strict Tory principles is not the result of
those principles, but arises from wholly un-
avoidable causes. And the narrow, super-
ficial British globe-trotter, whenever he
finds a country which is not governed exactly
after the British pattern, at once concludes
that whatever goes wrong with it is caused
by its deviation from British principles.
This, of course, necessitates the assumption
that nothing ever goes seriously wrong with
a country that is governed on strictly J.
Bull methods—that there is no starvation
in London or other great cities, no want or
hunger in the Scotch Highlands, no steady
depopulation and constant discontent in Ire-
land, no sweating, no pauperism, no sub-
merged tenth, and that Britain is a land of
peace and harmony generally. This is a
large order, but the Villiers type of globe-
trotter is quite equal to it,
Sixteen years ago, as Frederic Villiers
rightly states, Maoriland was a vast deal
happier than it now is. There was no
Labor element in politics in those days, and
the Bank of New Zealand paid 15 per cent,
dividends then, and the Loan and Mercantile
Co. had not struck its awful snag, and the
revenue left a big surplus over expenditure,
and wages were higher, and land kept rising
' in value, and the people had not lost confi-
dence in their financial institutions as they
now have, and squatting and fanning both
paid very much better than they do to-day,
' and the cities were growing fast, and gold-
mining was more profitable, and many other
beautiful things were happening. Maori-
’ land was a bright and joyous land to inhabit
in those days when there was no Liberal
Government, or one-man-one-vote, or one-
■) woman-one-ditto, and the country travelled
I mainly on sound British principles. And
> now, as Villiers truly observes, Maoriland
is ruled by paid politicians, and has a strongly
Democratic Government, and all these
[ beautiful circumstances have departed never,
l apparently, to return ; therefore, Villiers
J assumes that the Democratic Government is
necessarily the reason of their vanishment.
! But, as it happens, the circumstances are the
J other side up. It was the vanishment of all
these past glories which was, and is, the
* reason for the present Democratic Govern-
’ ment. And instead of labor legislation
causing the fall of Maoriland’s big bank, the
, obvious crumbling of that bank was one of
. the things which caused the labor legislation,
and many other things besides.
i * * *
1 The prosperity of Maoriland 16 years
ago was hollow and uureal, as was also that
'■ of the other Australias. It was created by
I borrowing money at the rate of about 2J
millions per annum, equal to about £8 a
year for each inhabitant—which is much the
• same as if Great Britain borrowed abroad
f At the rate of £300,000,000 a year. Also,
! the Treasury then made another £3 a year
' for each inhabitant out of land-sales, and so
. long as the borrowing and the public lands
\ lasted all was well. The superficial Villiers
saw the country in those days, and concluded
that its state of prosperity was healthy and
; natural, probably because there being no
foreign borrowing and no public land-sales
1 in England he could not realise the existence
of such things elsewhere. And then both
these sources of revenue became worn out,
and Maoriland had to send away some £2 7s.
annually per inhabitant for interest on the
, cost of those bye-gone revels. If Great
■ Britain, the country that Villiers comes
’ from, were similarly burdened in proportion
to population, its interest bill would be some-
' thing like £100,000,000 per annum, or more
than its entire present revenue, and all that
amount would leave the country yearly.
The old semi-Tory Governments of the past
built up this stupendous liability, and it was
mainly their utter incapacity to deal with the
monster they had created that forced the so-
called Labor Ministry of to-day into exis-
tence. But the people are certainly not so
1 happy under the new regime as under the
old. The old Tory days were the drunk
over-night ; the present Democratic regime
is the recovery in the morning. And the
drunk which Maoriland had in those by-gone
times, when it was governed under the system
which Villiers so cordially approves, was
such as no other country outside Australasia
ever had without defaulting when the re-
covery set it,
• * *
It is quite possible, as alleged, that
Labor legislation had something to do with
the awful smash of the Bank of New Zealand
anti other institutions. The sudden end
°f the boom made a tremendous depre-
ciation in land-values, and the land which
the big bank had accumulated went down
with the rest. The fall in the prices of pro-
duce in Europe made more depreciation.
The land-tax made still another drop. But
the land-tax was imposed as a dire necessity
by a Government which had to tax every-
thing in sight in order to raise revenue to
meet the liabilities bequeathed to it by its
good old Conservative predecessors. More-
over, the bank’s troubles and the land-tax
both began years before the first Labor
administration took office. And in New
South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland,
where there has never been any Labor
Government, or any land-tax worth men-
tioning, or any woman-suffrage, the same
financial disaster arrived in an even worse
form, and is still with us. Therefore, it
would seem that a strictly Fat Man form of
Government is quite as fatal to capital as the
other kind, if not more so. And in Victoria,
as in Maoriland, the first really Liberal
Government came into existence after the
crash, when the palsied hand of Fat proved
utterly unable to cope with the disasters it
had brought about. The bursting of one
boom made Turner, just as the bursting of
another made Ballance, and Victoria also
was far happier under the Fat Men of
the boom days than it is now, for the same
reason that the young Juggins who is
spending his fortune is happier than the old
reformed Juggins who is sorrowfully looking
back on the fortune that is spent.
• • •
Sixteen or twenty years ago hardly anyone
in Australasia seriously cared about demo-
cratic government, or one-man-one-vote, or
woman suffrage, or checking the accumula-
tion of big estates, or State banks, or any
other of the political theories of to-day. In
those times there was, comparatively speak-
ing, abundance of money—borrowed money
mostly—and an immense revenue was derived
by trading away the public estate, and wool
was nearly twice its present value, and
because of the abundance of money work
was much more plentiful than it now
is, and wages were high, and profits
and dividends were good. A country
which enjoys all these blessings never
worries much about political problems ; the
kind of Government which produces such
results is good enough for any average com-
munity. It was the leanness and famine of
after years that created the present demo-
cratic party in politics ; if the old orgie
could have gone on for ever the Fat Man
might have governed the country indefinitely.
The new Labor element may not have done
much, and it may have experimented wildly
and foolishly, but its circumstances are so
unprecedented that things could hardly be
otherwise. It was created on the ruins
of the wildest financial outbreak in
modern history, with general instructions to
find some method by which a prematurely
aged community could be ground up in the
mills of God and made young again—to dis-
cover some solution for the problem of
poverty and want of work which no one has
ever yet solved. The landlords, finan-
ciers, Fat Men, and all the “respectable”
elements of the community held that
these evils were a part of the natural order
of things, and they refused to attempt a
solution of the problem—in most cases they
refused even to admit that there was any
problem to solve. Therefore, the hungry
masses took to sending printers, miners,
shearers, and pick-and-shovel men into the
Legislature. They also have failed to solve
the question—failed utterly in the vastness
of their ignorance and inexperience ; but, at
least, they went one better than their pre-
decessors, for they made an attempt —an
honest attempt in the main—to put things
right. And, if it be finally written of them
that they tried and failed, it will be at least
a nobler epitaph than that of their Fat Man
predecessors, who never tried at all.
» # »
South Australia and Maoriland, the most
distinctly Democratic of the seven provinces,
are just now suffering—the latter especially—
from a violent attack of experimental legisla-
tion. Many of the experiments will probably
prove futile, and dozens of the measures now
being passed will be repealed in disgust a few
years hence. These more or less blind
efforts to find a remedy for the social evil
which is as old as original sin are doubtless
very ridiculous—everything is more or less
ridiculous. England, until within the last
few years, avoided the question by simple
and truly British devices. At one time it
made vagrancy a capital offence, and kept
down the great problem of poverty by hang-
ing the very poor. Then it took to en-
couraging emigration, and for very many
years shipped off its great social difficulty in
huge masses to Canada, the United States,
South Africa, Australia, Maoriland, and
elsewhere, and thus passed on most of the
great unanswerable conundrum to some one
else. It has still profound faith in the advan-
tages of exporting its national conundrum,
as is evidenced by the encouragement which
is lent to Booth’s scheme for dumping down
the worst section of British pauperism on
the doorstep of the “colonies.” Austral-
asia, having no convenient place for export,
has to try to find a remedy on its own
ground, and its efforts in this direction
naturally shock the British globe-trotter,
who believes, because his own country has
“ moved on ” its poor for many years, that
the same moving-on process is the natural
and only legitimate treatment—at all events,
he has nothing better to suggest. Alto-
gether, there is little comfort and less good
advice to be obtained from the Villiers

Prayer for Rain and Prayer for Work.
A few weeks ago the churches offered up
special prayers for rain in New South Wales at
a time when it was badly wanted. The
rain arrived a few hours afterwards, and it
has been arriving more or less ever since. The
inevitable result is that the churches are suffer-
ing very badly from swelled head, and keep
pointing out, for the billionth time or there-
abouts, that the efficacy of prayer has been
fully demonstrated, and that the Church, as an
institution which knows how to pray effec-
tively, is absolutely essential to the welfare of
the community. And the Reid Government
has gone out of its way to cadge for votes on
the ground that it believes in the Church—
somewhat after the fashion of the man who
tries to attain sudden importance on the ground
that he once lived next door to the brother of
a celebrated criminal just hanged.
“ I belong,” said Jacob Garrard, “ to a Ministry which
recognises God over all. The country had been languish-
ing for something that no Ministry could give—that no
political creed could supply, and the Ministry had asked
the people to join in an appeal to God. Those who
laughed and scoffed at the idea of the Ministry setting
apart a day for humiliation and prayer for rain had their
mouths closed by the ready answer to the prayers of the
people.”
All this grows very wearisome, and the contro-
versy about the efficacy of prayer gets no
further advanced. Therefore, The Bulletin
rises to suggest a reasonable, simple, and effec-
tive test. Let the Churches pray that lack of
employment shall wholly cease in Australia,
and that there shall be work and sufficient
wages for all who want work—not sand-shifting
or other useless State relief done with borrowed
money, but useful employment. The clergy
have never seriously tackled this question yet,
though it is even more essential than the rain
difficulty. Want of rain is only a temporary
trouble; want of work, and consequent want
of food, have burdened mankind for count-
less ages. Moreover, rain always comes,
sooner or later, whether the Churches pray
or not, therefore they know that rain
will follow prayer because it follows every-
thing in course of time. It even follows
battles, hangings, sudden deaths, epileptic fits,
disembowelment per circular-saw, prize-fights,
riots, Armenian atrocities, and murders, so the
fact that it arrives after prayer is not surpris-
ing. The church prays unitedly and conspicu-
ously for rain, knowing that it must come in
any case. If it believes in its own creed let it
pray as loudly and unitedly for the other thing.
Abundance of work doesn’t come in any case.
It is much more wanted than rain. And if it
comes it will be a much more convincing
answer. In short, let the churches keep on, if
they like, praying for the thing that comes
without prayer, but let them also pray for the
thing that doesn’t come without prayer. The
perpetual desire to lift the light end of the log
and the constant avoidance of the heavy end
look like a great want of faith on the part of
the local cleric.
“A Social Cancer.”
Editor Bulletin, —Your article (Sept. 21) “A
Social Cancer ” touches upon a very great evil
which demands serious attention. You rightly
deplore dealing with effects instead of causes,
yet you have fallen into that very mistake your-
self. Motherhood should not be a disgrace,
and will not be when women are free; but, at
present, motherhood is unhappily disgraced,
and as much inside marriage as out of it. You
describe motherhood as “ the supreme self-
sacrifice ; ” surely that description is illogical,
unless a woman willingly takes upon herself the
functions of motherhood. Forced self-sacrifice
is a contradiction in terms, and all motherhood
that is not willing is disgraced, no matter what
priest or clergyman may have declared it legal.
You blame women for the present state of
affairs, yet men alone have had the making of
the laws, and it is they who have branded as
“illegitimate” a child born out of wedlock,
and who have thrown the whole responsibility
on to the unfortunate woman. It is men who
have decreed that a child born in wedlock
belongs solely to the father, the married mother
having no rights ; and it is they who, by their
unequal divorce laws, have promulgated the
devil’s doctrine that immorality is a crime in
woman, but only a venial offence in man. Since
women have had no voice in making the laws,
why should the whole responsibility of our un-
just social system be thrown on them ? Again,
with regard to conventional religion, is it not
men-priests and ministers—who have done their
best to keep women in subjection, and to pre-
vent them from taking an active part in
national life ? and have not men, as a whole,
striven to keep women in ignorance of the
seamy side of life ? What has been the reward
of those women who have broken the con-
spiracy of silence and have protested against
injustice in every shape and form ? Would it
not be better, instead of blaming women for
their acquiescence (in a vast majority of cases
unconscious acquiescence) in the degradation of
their sisters involved by the false standards set
up by male lawgivers and priests, for men and
women to cease throwing stones at one another,
and to work together to bring in a truer and
higher ideal of life and to make our cities ap-
proximate slightly to the ideal laid down by
Whitman, whose great city is “ where there are
the greatest men and women, and where the
cleanliness of the sexes stands?” Your proposed
remedy for the present state of things would
only increase the evil. According "to your
article, the State is practically to relieve a
father and mother of all duties and responsibili-
ties with regard to their children. Is mother-
hood, then, purely a physical function, and
nothing else? If parentage is such a holy
thing as you say, why are the children deprived
of the mother’s care and of the father’s train-
ing? Or does the State propose to provide
mother-love at so much per pound ? What we
want is not less parental responsibility, but
more ; and the great aim of the "Woman Move-
ment is to secure equal justice between man
and woman, and to uplift the sacred responsi-
bility of parenthood, which has too long been
sacrificed to the insatiable Moloch of Lust.—A
New Woman.
[Tub Bulletin gives this space as a representative reply,
and diffidently adds a few remarks. (I>. Doesn’t a New
Woman willingly become a mother when she marries?
Isn’t her marriage a voluntary contract? Doesn’t she
know what it implies? If she doesn’t, how is society to
teach her? Doesn’t she read the evening newspapers?
Society heavily punishes the male concerned in forced
sexual union ; when once a New Woman says “ I will ” to
voluntary sexual union, and the wicked wolf locks his
front door, how is society to save the innocent lamb?
(2). The Bulletin does not, and did not, wholly
blame women for the present state of affairs.
It doesn’t blame anybody—only Things As They Are. It
has pointed out that the higher the standard of chastity,
the lower the depth of complementary prostitution ; also
that by the dread of her sex’s general scorn and pity for
a “fallen woman,’’ and by her own sense that illegitimate
motherhood was a “disgrace,” the Sydney- victim was
driven to the abortionist. The Bulletin attributed her
death to “Society,” “social traditions”—for which men
are doubtless as responsible as women. The Bulletin cor-
dially denounces those men. It never did otherwise. Why
won’ttheNew Woman weighherwords—andotherpeople’s?
(2). This paper didn’t propose “a remedy for the present
state of things ” in the large and airy fashion of the New
Woman. There is no “ remedy for the present state of
things;” and as “the present state of things” has arrived
by a very slow process of evolution, permanent improve-
ment can only come through more evolution. This paper
did propose a palliative for abortion, and does so still, in
the shape of a State hospital, with no questions asked,
and women (except patients)shoo’d into the next county.
“ Why are the children deprived of the mother’s care and
the father’s training?” Because these articles, left to
themselves, mean suicide, as in Adelaide ; murder, as in
Melbourne ; and abortion, as in Sydney ; and because
State parentage, though objectionable in many ways, is
infinitely preferable to these things.— Ed. B.]
The Law’s Unfixedness.
In a Maoriland town, the other day, a hotel-
keeper was charged with “ allowing women of
ill-fame to remain on his premises longer than
was necessary for reasonable refreshment.”
Very naturally he rose and asked how long the
Bench considered was necessary for a woman
of ill-fame to have reasonable refreshment, and
the Bench was hopelessly stumped by the
question, but it went right on with the case


none the less, and delivered judgment. This
is another example of how the law dodges its
responsibilities. Quite recently an Adelaide
Bench decided, to the surprise of every
one, that betting on commission wasn’t
betting within the meaning of the Act, but,
though the law thus decided that it wasn’t
the thing people supposed it to be, it
declined to give any expression of opinion
as to what kind of thing it was, so that
now no one knows what it is. A Melbourne
Court lately ruled that a man who laid odds on
the pavement couldn’t be prosecuted, because
the pavement wasn’ta “fixed place.” Common-
sense would have decided that it was a fixed
place, and that it was the man who was unfixed,
seeing that he moved about to different parts of
the pavement, but the “ statoot ” regarded it
otherwise. Yet, though it decided that the
pavement wasn’t fixed, it didn’t explain how it
had become unfixed, or how unfixed it
was, or how any place can be otherwise
than fixed, so the world is again left in
doubt. And the Maorilaud law now decides
that a lady of loose character mustn’t remain in
a hotel longer than is necessary for reasonable
refreshment, but it won’t say how long is
necessary, or how much refreshment is reason-
able for a lady of loose character, so the blighted
publican must wander forth to wrestle with the
conundrum all alone. Legal retribution is a
hazy thing which arrives mostly by accident.
Sometimes the door is left open audit blows in,
and at other times it arrives in other ways, but
it is almost always intangible and unaccount-
able.
Tlie N.S.W. Free-Postage Scandal.
From a Parliamentary return it appears that
the cost to N.S.W. Treasury of advertising in
the Sydney dailies the lists of names under the
Electoral Act from 21st to 25th Sept., ’95, was
.£348. No wonder the daily papers never
go straight, when in addition to a free postage
subsidy of (say) from .£30,000 to £40,000 a year
they get little pickings such as the foregoing.
Newspaper free - postage is a gross job,
especially when the leading daily (“ Freetrade ”
it calls itself!) of Sydney has the gall to object
to Free Public Education while putting thou-
sands per annum in its proprietary’s pocket, per
medium of the free-postage grab. Newspapers
are purely commercial speculations, and there is
no more public reason for passing Brown’s
newspaper-merchandise through the post free
than there is for free-passing Smith’s gin-
merchandise. There is no more honest reason
for the State giving the newspapers free special
trains every morning than there would be for
it giving brewers Tooth and Toohey a free
beer-train every morning. If you give one
public newspaper free postage you must give it
to every other public newspaper, and in N.S.
Wales every public newspaper and scores of
papers that are not public newspapers are
carried free. This sweating of the taxpayer is
perpetrated in no other Australian province,
and, so far as The Bulletin knows, in no other
country in the world. The free-postage steal,
conducted under the cry of “ education for the
masses,” but really on behalf of a coterie whose
most influential members, the S. M. Herald pro-
prietary, oxdy the other day, wrote down the
Parliamentary proposal to make the N.S.W.
Public-schools really free, on the ground that
the province could not afford to do so, costs
New South Wales about £70,000 a year !
For, in addition to bona - fide newspapers,
every trade-circular masquerading as a news-
paper is carried free by post. To such a length
is the system carried (and in a desperate time
of public need), that not long ago a trading
M. who was issuing a business-circular w'ent
round, got enough advts. to cover the cost of
issue, registered the print as a newspaper at
a cost of a few shillings, and calmly dumped
into the post-office one hundred thousand copies
of his trade-circular, which were carried free
for him by the miserable taxpayer ! And the
N. members of Parliament are too fright-
ened of the newspapers to “ stoush ” the free-
postage reach-out.
“ Pleasant ” Presbyterianism.
The Presbyteries of Melbourne North and
South have decided to wrestle prayerfully with
sundry modern problems. These holy bodies
would fain know whether “pleasant Sunday
afternoons ” are good for religion, and whether
the use of the magic-lantern for illustrating
sacred subjects can be legitimately adopted by
the disciples of John Knox. An ordinary lost
mortal might easily settle both these points if
the Presbyterian Conscience would, in the first
place, state the real object of religion, and, in
the second place, define “ legitimacy ” as re-
lating to Church work.. Presuming that reli-
gion is simply a means of support for parsons,
and a cloak for bank-directors, worldly wisdom
feels bound to warn it against countenancing
any sort of Sunday addresses which don’t
bring grist to the mill. Pew-rents and
sixpences in the plate are the life-blood of pro-
fessional religion. A congregation supports
the parson in order to save its own soul,
and the fraudulent gilded boomster pays
top price for his individual salvation.
Let him and the other people get into the
habit of attending “ pleasant Sunday ” gather-
ings in connection with the Church, where they
can feel pious free of charge—and the financial
character of religion will assuredly suffer. Not
much at the outset; but, as time goes on, and
the afternoon attendance comes to be generally
reckoned as an act of piety, and gets sub-
stituted for attendance at evening service,
religion will lose a bit. No far-seeing Pres-
bytery can favor this new-fangled Sawbath
entertainment, especially if it harbors serious
intentions of working up to its name. A truly
“ pleasant afternoon ” sandwiched between a
theological morning and evening would sooner
or later be singled out for enjoyment, like a
savory slice of ham, whilst the two thick slices
of stale bread were left upon the counter un-
tasted. The Bulletin advises every Presbytery
to place the brand of sin upon the brow of
this P.S.A. idea, and stigmatise it as a devilish
suggestion. With magic-lantern slides for
illustrating sacred subjects the church can
afford to be in cordial sympathy, if the object
of religion is to tempt young people into the
tabernacle. Tun Bulletin recommends the
experiment of a darkened evening-service, a
largo sheet stretched in front of the altar, and
a skilful operator casting suitable views
thereon as the shepherd drones out his
sermon. A magic - lantern is the natural ally
of church religion, because its ways are
dark, and therefore attractive to the young.
Sermons illustrated with views would lure
many an engaged couple from moonlight walks,
although a gloom-enshrouded pew might not
seem preferable to a ramble in the fog. And if
a very hardshell Presbyterian meenister can’t
persuade his conscience to sanction pictures on
the sheet, he can make his sermons equally
popular by turning out the gas. It isn’t “ more
Light ” that the unco guid require. Light is
fatal to dogma and superstition. True faith
is never so happy as when seated in a dim,
religious corner, hugging a dear delusion un-
observed.
In re Dean.
Leak. Bulletin, —I, among, I am sure, hun-
dreds of others, cannot help feeling emphatically
disgusted concerning the attitude of nearly
everybody connected with the Dean case, in-
cluding counsel, defence committee, and daily
press. For instance, it is gravely recorded
that Salomons, Q. 0., believes Dean to be
guilty ; Pilcher, Q.C., believes him to be inno-
cent ; the President of the Royal Commission
was of opinion that Dean’s guilt was not open
to reasonable doubt ; Mr. Goddard, Mr.
Moodie, and other members of the defence
committee, believe him to be innocent; Mr.
Meagher says he is innocent; Mr. Crick
vouches for his innocence ; Mrs. Dean believes
her husband to be guilty ; so do his mother-in-
law and the Attorney-General, and the majority
of the bar—sore at the granting by Government
of a re-opening of the trial; Dean, the party
most interested, believes himself to be inno-
cent; while the Judge who tried him for his
life is as certain that he attempted to poison
his wife as though he had seen him with his
own eyes administering the lethal agencies.
Everybody, in fact, considers it necessary to
deliver a pronouncement concerning Dean’s
innocence or guilt, whereas the only question
involved—a question studiously ignored by the
interested, and absolutely lost sight of by the
unthinking—is to be found in the verdict
of two-thirds of the Royal Commission ap-
pointed to examine and report upon the case,
viz., that the evidence was not sufficient to
substantiate a conviction; in other words,
Dean was released by virtue of a find-
ing by the Commission equivalent to
the Scotch verdict “ Not proven.” It
does not matter a rap whether Dean is
innocent of the crime with which he was
charged, or not. Mr. Pilcher, should not put
himself out in the matter at all. Mr. Goddard,
Mr. Moodie, and the other members of the
committee, are not, and should not be, alarmed
by any subsequent development of the great
Dean case. They did their duty in agitating
for the appointment of the Commission to re-
open the matter. It is of no consequence
whether they knew Dean to be guilty or not;
as far as the safety of the community is con-
cerned, it is of no consequence even whether his
solicitor himself knew Dean to be guilty. The
public interest lies not in Dean’s guilt or in
Dean’s innocence, but in this, viz., that (1) the
evidence submitted to the jury was not such
as to justify a conviction ; and (2), the
jury was obviously and unduly influenced
in its finding by a prejudicial deliverance
from the Judge, already possessing a bias
against the assumption of the prisoner’s inno-
cence. If Dean were a Deeming, and a Peace,
and a Wainewright rolled into one ; and if
the most stainless public characters, including
Aristides himself, believed him guilty ; still,
if there were “ a reasonable doubt ” (which
is a euphemism for “insufficient evidence”)
about his guilt; then, according to the tra-
ditions of that justice, which it is the conser-
vative fashion to denominate as British, but
which is no less Australian or human generally,
there could not possibly be a just conviction. —

N.S.W. Mining-Company Law.
Mr. Humphery has introduced in N.S.W.
Leg. Council a Bill to amend the No Liability
Mining Go’s Act, and the Government repre-
sentative has announced Ministerial approval of
it. The Act badly needs amending ; for it is
vague in a dozen places, and, on account of the
absence of schedules, the registration of com-
panies under it is both uncertain and expensive.
Worse still, in view of the Westralian excite-
ment, it is impossible to register under it any
co. which has been formed to work a mine out-
side N.S.W. Mr. Humphery’s Bill seeks to
meet some of the shortcomings which a dozen
years’ experience has exhibited. Two vital
changes are proposed —to permit registration
of a co, to work a mine anywhere; and
to allow the directors to reinstate shares which
have been forfeited for non-payment of calls,
provided the holder pays up after the forfeiture,
which, as now, is to take place without any
resolution on the directors’ part. It is still
proposed that only 10 per cent, of the contri-
buting capital need be paid-up in cash prior to
registration. Ten per cent, is not enough, and
the provision is otherwise bad. The leading
feature of the measure—the feature which gives
to it its name—is that the shareholder may
cease paying calls whenever he pleases. The
No Liability co’s shares are therefore compara-
tively safe things to gamble with. Popular
on this account, professional promoters refuse
to submit any other kind of co. to the public.
Then, with a bare 10 per cent, of the contrihuthuj
capital paid up, and 8 per cent, of that pro-
bably swamped in preliminary expenses and
vendors’ payments, the co., with a nominal
capital of perhaps <£loo,ooo, sets out on its
alleged mining career with a credit balance of
£3OO or ,£4OO. Frequently a call has to be
made within a week after work is really started.
Then begins the issue of those ridiculous official
reports which The Bulletin has often quoted
—desperate reports that are nevertheless neces-
sary in order to draw out the calls. Meantime
a few thousand shares have been judiciously
“placed” and a “rig” begins; the profes-
sional promoter clears out, and, the boom
having eased off, calls refuse to come in, and
another “ mine” is deserted, and the company
glides peacefully into liquidation. The Bul-
LETXN knows Barrier “ mines,” formerly owned
by no - liability mining co’s with nominal
capitals of from ,£50,000 to £lOO,OOO, on which
less than a thousand pounds was spent from
first to last, the work being stopped before it
had got to the point where it could prove any-
thing. The whole secret was that the pro-
moters had got out of their shares, the market
(being flooded with promoters’ shares) refused
to look at the contributing ones, calls remained
unpaid (all prospect of a successful gamble
being over), and the mines remained as much
unproved as ever they were. The worst feature
often was that the fool-prospector undertook
when handing over his leases not to part with
any of his shares for, say, six months. If it is
intended to make so-called mining a mere pre-
text for gambling, well and good ; 10 per cent,
paid up is enough. In fact, the existence of
any mine at all is superfluous; and it should be
sufficient if enough were paid up to pay the
printer for turning out the scrip—only in that
case the promoter and the professional director
would grumble. But, if it is intended to make
companies really serve the mining industry in
some little degree, then we must declare that
before registration is granted 10 or 20 or 30 per
cent, of the contributing capital shall be
actually available for prospecting or mining
purposes. By the way, too, the proposed pro-
vision for the reinstatement of forfeited shares
opens up a cheering prospect before the pro-
fessional new-company director.
The N.S. W. Marine Board gave a somewhat
unaccountable decision when it suspended for
six months the certificate of second officer
Lanfear, of the wrecked Catterthun. Lanfear
took charge of the vessel shortly before the
disaster, and was in charge when the smash
took place. The course had been set by the
captain, and he followed it closely so long as it
seemed safe to do so. When the Great Seal
Rock appeared ahead he promptly altered the
course so as to avoid this unexpected danger. If
he had waited to call the captain before making
the change, and the vessel had struck during I lie
few seconds or minutes thus lost, he would
assuredly have been severely dealt with for his
cowardice in not taking instant action at such
a crisis, on his own responsibility. As the
Catterthun struck anyhow, he is dealt with
because he did act on his own responsi-
bility. The Marine Board suspends Lanfear
for doing what he did, but it hasn’t the moral
courage to say exactly, for the guidance of the
next man so situated, what he should have done.
Therefore, the next man will probably do some-
thing else, and perhaps thereby lose his ship
also, and then the same Board will suspend his
certificate for not doing what Lanfear was
suspended for doing. If the Marine Board
knows, as it professes to do, that Lanfear did
a wrong thing, then it must know what was
the right thing to do. And a Board that knows
the right thing to do, and yet fails to definitely
explain it so as to avert similar catastrophes in
future, is playing it very low down on the com-
munity.
Melbourne dailies have been significantly
silent over the sequel to the sentence of 20
strokes with the birch recently passed by
Justice A’Beckett, with official-medical con-
currence, on a youth found guilty of an obscene
offence. The mental weakness of the miserable
wretch was made so apparent by the circum-
stances of the case and the behaviour of the
offender, that even the jury of laymen expressed
its opinion that he was demented. Official
medical opinion was that the lad was “silly,
weak-willed, and paralysed,” but legally sane—
i.e., he knew right from wrong. Asked by the
Judge if it thought a birching would do the
boy good, the medical department replied that
it thought it would. So the birching was
ordered, together with three months gaol. But
the newly-formed Criminology Society happily
got on the track of the proceeding, and, by suc-
ceeding in the vigorous protest it caused to be
made in Parliament, at once justified its exist-
ence. Very quietly the birching was remitted,
not a word being uttered by the respectable
press upon the subject, before or after.
While Primate Smith was calling upon Premier
Reid in Sydney to proclaim a Day of Thanks-
giving for the rain, a carrier at Broken Hill was
telling his experiences—the most serious of them
occurring on the very days on which the rain
was falling on the roof of the Primate’s palace.
This teamster left Broken Hill with eight good
horses, drawing the small load of five tons of
flour, bran and chaff for Wilcannia. He was
11 days on the track (ordinary time, four to five
days) ; during that period his horses ate tons
of the loading. Receipts for the other tons,
at £5 per ton, £l2 10s. He loaded wool back,
trying the team with only tons. But as the
horses couldn’t eat Wool, and as there was little
else for them, three of the animals died. Then
he threw off the wool by the track, and crept
back with his five horses, just managing to drag
them into town. The trip pans out thus :
Cr.: £l2 10s. Dr.: Driver, five weeks, £lO ;
three horses, £45; feed and water en route, £l5;
sundries (in loading, etc.), £s—total, £75. Loss,
£62 10s. And now he has to get the wool in some-
how. Primate Smith has only got half through
his job. To thanksgive yet is absurdly prema-
ture. Between Jan. and Sept. 1, Sydney had 22in.
of rain. Menindie had less than 4in. ; Bourke,
4|in. ; Wilcannia, 6|in. ; Broken Hill, sin.
Some of these places have, since the “ drought
broke up ” (either in answer to Primate Smith,
or to the supplications addressed to the
new copper Joss lately bought by the
Chinese of Warren for £4 10s.), had as
much as half-an-inch —some not that. None
of them in the Par West have had enough to do
the slightest good to the country. So that just
where it was most wanted the rain has not
fallen —which surely, in the circumstances,
cannot be regarded as that kind of an arrange-
ment of things which the State should take a
hand in thanksgiving for.
F.ditor Bu’-oETIN, The establishment of
lying-in hospitals, in which no questions are
asked and the children born are immediately
taken care of by the State, would undoubtedly
tend to lessen suicide, abortion, and infanti-
cide, though the latter saving would be some-
what counterbalanced by the mortality aqaong
infants consequent on artificial feeding. If the
State undertook to rear all children born in the
land there would be fairness in the establish-
ment of such hospitals ; but if only children
born out of wedlock are received, the man who
marries the woman he loves and does not shirk
the responsibilities of fatherhood, would have,
justly, to support his own progeny, and,
unjustly, to pay taxes to make provision for
the offspring of the bachelor, who, while prac-
tising unlimited polygamy, would have his
possibly enormous family brought up by the
State. Likewise, if the State arranged to
receive all women about to give birth to chil-
dren, there would be no injustice, but if only
unmarried women were received, then the
wedded woman, ready to fulfil her whole duty
to her babe, would still be forced by poverty
to trust herself at the critical time to unskilled
assistance and struggle through if she escaped
with her life, while the'unmarried woman would
receive medical assistance and full scientific
amelioration of her trial. Marriage would thus
become disadvantageous to both sexes, and the
establishment of homes and the institution of the
family would gradually decline among the poorer
classes. Surely it is right that a man should
support his own children, as much so for the
bachelor as for the benedict! It is the unfair
exoneration of the man from his responsibility,
leading as it does to the woman’s frantic
attempt to free herself also, which is the
cause of many of the present social evils.
Payment of sums of money will not cover a
father’s responsibility. All children should
have the full rights of legitimacy, and every
mother the privileges of a legal wife. Many,
women absolutely refuse money from a man for
the support of a child that is not legally con-
sidered his own, feeling that by its acceptance
they would be placed in the position of harlots
—paid after, if not before the , ;rth of the
child.— Wabra.
The new Victorian Governor’s reception, which
was to be quite a modest farce, promises to
grow into a shocking grovel. The idea of send-
ing merely a few M’sL. A. along in the Lady
Loch to meet Brassey’s yacht is now ridiculed
as something much too small for such a gigantic
occasion. The Lady Loch, indeed ! One of
the China Navigation Co.’s steamers will pro-
bably be loaded up with a few hundred thirsty
souls who couldn’t find room aboard the
Government’s private picnic boat. An awful
military and naval display is included in the
programme, and the swearing-in of Brassey at
the Exhibition Building threatens to smash the
record for pomp and circumstance. But it is
at St. Kilda that representative “ loyalty ”
means to do its worst. The Mayor and
Council have struck a scheme for demoralising
unto wormhood the rising generation. Every
schoolmaster in the district is invited, by
circular, to pin a certain reception-badge upon
the coat, cap, or pants of every boy who will
submit to the indignity. The badge is unique
in its puerility, and the rate-payers will have
to pay for the accursed thing. It bears two
inscriptions—“ Welcome Brassey ” and “Ad-
vance Australia ” —calculated to delude children
into a vague belief that the neighbourhood will
get a mighty impetus from Bbassey’s landing
there. One councillor, who keeps a fashionable
hotel, is suspected of an intention to vent his
joy in free beer for the masses on the eventful
day. Other councillors are itching to distin-
guish themselves. St. Kilda is rapidly going
mad, and nothing but a heavy fall of rain on
the Brassey demonstration will save the place
from howling lunacy. Democrats are herewith
invited to pray that the heavens will weep
copiously when Brassey comes ashore.
V illiers, the rampant war correspondent, is of
opinion that Britain should have gone to war
with France rather than allow that country
to occupy Madagascar, which, he holds, is
intended as a base from which to threaten
South Africa and Australia. As a war corres-
pondent, Villiebs finds his bread and butter
in war, and as a Jingo he has a natural yearn-
ing for gore and iron-clads and entrenchments,
and the banging of the big drum, and the up-
heaval of the Br-r-ritish flag. Meanwhile,
events are rapidly proving that he is a very use-
less and misguided variety of Jingo. The
Madagascar question, apparently, will settle
itself, partly through fever-and-ague and forest,
and partly because the bill for these stupendous
military operations is getting altogether too big.
A lot of similar questions would settle themselves
also if the rest of the world would only sit
down and look on. If France wants to be dis-
agreeable to Britain then the fact that it is
fooling away its money and its army in the
swamps of Madagascar makes it all the less able
to create trouble later on. If it ever wants to
attack Australia, which it could do much more
easily from Tonquin or New Caledonia, then
the dead men who have been left in the African
island won’t be available for the purpose at all
events; so there seems every reason why this
country should sit down and look on, and pre-
serve a dead silence. The great art of sitting
down at the right time and keeping quite still
needs to be cultivated a great deal more than
it is.
Louis Becke has now two or three volumes
on the London publishers’ stocks, bub his second
book in order of publication issues from an enter-
prising Sydney source. In “His Native Wife”
there is shown the same mastery of South Sea
Island incident, the same graphic narrative force,
which made “By Reef and Palm” famous.
Becke is a born story-teller, and practice
has given him the story-teller’s knack of
beating his grain of gold into any num-
ber of chapters required. One hurries . over
the preliminaries to get the real thrill of the clos-
ing scenes, in which a cheerful chieftain dives
under water with a missionary and knocks his
head on a jagged rock, while a no less vigorous
chieftainess stabs the missionary’s wife to the
heart, and her sister sails over the horizon witb
her handsome head pillowed on her Portuguese
lover’s bosom. These things are pure Becke, and
excellent reading, and one suffers gladly for their
sake the diluted Becke of the preceding chapters.
“ Kis Native Wife” certainly makes a promising
beginning for Alex. Lindsay’s “ Australander ”
series. Post free from Bulletin office, Is. 4d.

The “Arcadian Eve,” in one act, took
well at Sydney Lyceum, on Saturday, notwith-
standing which it is a thin little affair, which
wouldn’t be visible if it turned sideways. It
relates to a married man, who has a magic ring,
and, when he rubs it in his wife’s absence, a lovely
goddess (Miss Florence Young) bursts in through
the back of the scenery, and the two do a glorious
mash. His wife finds them together, and objects
strongly. Later, the wife rubs the ring in her
husband’s absence, and a fine, upstanding im-
mortal, in the person of Wallace Browlow, enters,
and another mash ensues. The husband presently
finds them together. There is some pretty, but
not especially surprising, music in this fragmen-
tary effort, and the immortals make one or two
moderately smart observations, but that is about
all.

“ Mam’zelle Nifcouche,” with Miss Juliet
Wray as the good girl of the convent school, went
well from start to finish. The new girl goes out
on her sinful burst in a manner that, in many
respects, is so exactly like the sinful burst of the
previous girl that it is hardly possible to tell one
sinful burst from another. Miss W\’s activity
and overflowing vitality eminently qualify her to
go out on a burst and make things lively while it
lasts. Unfortunately, the new star seems still to
have the remains of a bad cold on her adorable
little chest, and though her singing was very good
on the whole, and the drum solo in particular was
an admirable performance, she had to shut
down on one or two enthusiastic encores. The
rest of the cast was practically the same as it was
the last time “Nitouche” went on its demoralising
career in Sydney. Lauri added no fresh touches
to the organist, which was satisfactory, for that
mild, long-haired person was so near perfection
before that any change would almost certainly be
for the worse, and the other characters wisely
followed his example. “ Paul Jones ” was billed
Thursday and Friday, and, on Saturday,
‘ Pinafore ” is to raise its almost-forgotten head
after eight years’ absence, for the joy of a new
generation which knows not Captain Corcoran.
** * *
Her Majesty’s (Sydney) was full in every
part on Saturday night, when the Woods-Marshall
co. opened in the “ Prairie King ”—a dreadful
blood-curdler of the bear-haunted regions of the
West. It is built on the same principles as the
ordinary scalp-hunting penny-dreadful, with a ton
of tomato-colored Indians on the cover, likewise
the long-haired hero staving them off with a large
quantity of revolvers. There is not, in all its
four acts, one fragment of literary merit, except
in the part of the horse, which drops through the
broken bridge into the raging tank below. The
downfall of this noble animal, and the fearsome
splash with which he strikes the water, are
bright spots in an otherwise purposeless show.
On Saturday night King Hedley, the great Amur-
rikan actor, failed to get a hold of the ruins of the
bridge ; and went down along with the horse,
whereat the audience cheered vociferously, and
called out “encore.” The rest of the production
consists of Mr. Plimmer, as a copious villain of
the cheap and murky character who hangs round
and wants to be r-r-revenged on the King for
something not very well-defined ; Miss Harrie
Ireland as a child of the wilderness in deerskin
pants and a coat; a Mexican woman of the inco-
herent teeth-gnashing description ; two tramps
who drift in and out and cadge for liquor; a
purposeless little Jew, perpetrated in good style
by Mr. Walter Haybittle; a captive cheild, per-
petrated by nobody in particular ; and a general
tendency to rush about on horseback and fire guns
off promiscuously. Plimmer and the King wave
their artillery at each other whenever they
meet, but nothing particular happens. The
characters have no visible connection with each
other, and their chief business is to arrive suddenly
and state that the Indians may be expected at any
moment. The Prairie King himself has nothing to
recommend him save his horsemanship; he is a
stiff, dreary, awkward person, who states through
his nose that he is returning to his home in the
West. As he is then at San Franoisoo, it appears
that he is going to ride out into the Pacific Ocean
and become a Chinese mandarin. The scenery
and the horse call for unlimited commendation,
and Miss Ireland is a pleasant spectacle in the
pants, and Mr. Plimmer is a capable villain, and
the independent hair of the prairie nfbnarch is
interesting because it is so long and so liable to be
caught in the bridge, but otherwise the drama is
the Great American Horror howling in the Yose-
mite valjey, or down the canons of the Colorado,
and falling heavily into the tank as one who
refuses to be comforted.
** * *
The rather depressing “My Sweetheart,”
«t Sydney Royal, has been succeeded by a still
more depressing medley described as “Revels.”
Why it is called so this paper knoweth not.
There is a dude in it who falls on to the floor
occasionally, and a man who has had his pants
dragged off, and returns to show his legs in pink
tights, and an old, old joke about a tough fowl,
and a very ancient, moss-backed witticism about
nothing in particular, and a person who puts his
head in many, many times to say that ice-cream
is waiting inside. One or two pretty dances are
turned on here and there, but in the main
“Revels” is a sick and sorry affair which
lacks even the energy to be actively awful.
The Bulletin man began to drop off towards
the end of it, and dreamt that he was the Last
Man sitting on a cinder on top of a burnt world,
and an endless procession of skeletons went by,
60 000,000,000 abreast, all dragging their fleshless
feet through an ocean of black ashes, and champ-
ing their flesh I ess jaws, and having revels
generally. The procession went on till the whole
Caucasian race was used up, and then came
Africans, Eskimo, missing links, troglodytes, and
other sundries. And, finally, the author of the
above burlesque came along on all fours at the
extreme end of the procession, and The Bulletin
man decided that it was the right place for him,
provided the Undermost troglodyte didn’t feel
hurt at him being there. This paper desires to be
just without any undue severity, but it feels that
the joke about the tough fowl requires to be put
down with all the rigor of the law.

Monday was announced as the last night
of the “Scrap of Paper” at Sydney Criterion, so,
by the time these remarks get into print, that
house will probably have relapsed into its former
state of emptiness. Apparently, there is no great
demand for comedy just now in Sydney, which
has wandered away in pursuit of the mesmerist,
and the variety-show, and the horse that falls
into the tank, and other strange gods—at all
events, that seems the only possible explanation
why a good piece and two excellent artistes should
have retired from the scene after such a brief
season. The Daeres are now open for engagement,
and, considering their remarkable capabilities,
they should be in demand,
* * * *
Sydney Tivoli has got hold of a highly-
successful sensation in the shape of Albert Ban-
vard’s “dive from the dome,” though if Albert
wants to keep ahead of the rival sensation at Her
Majesty’s he will presently have to take a horse
up into the dome along with him, and dive with
that intelligent animal for company. The Jeru-
salem cyclorama is doing reasonably well, and a
few casual shows came out on Monday night, and
caught the passing shekel by the forelock, and
then went in again.
* * * *
Professor Kennedy’s mesmeric-show still
prospers amazingly at Sydney School of Arts»
and all the bad things which The Bulletin has
said about it in previous issues are hereby repeated
with emphasis. Some other terms of opprobrium
which were omitted in these past notices are
understood to be thrown in along with the expres-
sions of disgust and indignation above mentioned.
* * * *
That old-time favorite, Mr. George Leitch,
is to take possession of Sydney Royal on the 19th
October with his stupendous spectacle, “The
Land of the Moa.” A large number of Maoris
have been imported for the production, and the
gentle savage does the old war-dances of his
fathers, and works himself up into a fearsome
state of excitement until the ancient cannibal
instinct revives, and he is liable to eat the orches-
tra at any moment. The scenery includes lakes,
mountains, volcanoes, waterfalls, and all the pic-
turesqueness which can be crowded into the avail-
able space.

Miss Annis Montague, the favorite song-
stress, is to have a large and enthusiastic send-off
at the Lyceum, on Thursday afternoon, next week.
About the largest and most fashionable honorary
committee on record is working up the event.
* * * *
The Fitzgerald Bros., after draining
Adelaide of its spare shekels and putting up a
record m that peaceful city, came along to Melb.
Exhibition Building on Saturday night. “ I he
most sensational show ever seen in Australia ” is
only a fair statement of fact concerning the deeds
of the Fitz.’s new company from Europe. Ten
turns fill the bill. Some of the smaller items
are above the average standard, whilst the four
largest have points which no colored poster could
improve upon. Two of these were not made the
most of on Saturday, Lhe stage in the centre
transept under the dome needed to stand a little
higher, with a fiercer light beating upon it. The
mid-air performances, being fully visible from afar
Rot all the credit they deserved, or nearly all, A
thrill is an immediate success, and the audience
gasps on the spot. But an appalling incident
is something for the spectators to enjoy mostly at
their leisure, a few hours after it happened. Then
they develop a burning sensation to buy another
ticket and lie thrilled again. Human nature, as
Waokford Squeers remarked, is a rum’un.
• * •
Les Freres Eclair, humorous contortionists,
seem to have discovered a few new methods of
throwing their bodies out of gear. One frere plays
the demon, and the other is a clever suggestion of
a crocodile gone mad. The whole act is a lively
exhibition of strength combined with uncanny
curves. At last, the demon stands head-
downward upon nothing. That is to say,
he places an iron extinguisher upon a pro-
perty candle, seizes the bent top of the ex-
tinguisher between his teeth, and supports himself
by means of his bite. Mahomet, the Talking
Horse, is the boss wonder of the show, considering
that he is only a lior.se. Mahomet picks up his
cues quicker, aud is probably familiar with the
different sounds of more words, than any other
trick animal of his breed. He’s a horse with a
memory. Pi< f-ssor Peart and Madame Adelina
Antonio supply the appalling incidents. Peart
is a thriller, pure and simple—nothing else. He
is hauled up to a small, shaky platform, put into
a sack, and plumped into a tank of water some 20
yards below. The tank is only Oft. x 7ft., with
6ft. depth of water in it. After emerging from
the damp sack, the Professor gets himself hauled up
to a still higher platform (on Saturday he preferred
to stop again at the lower one) and from there he
dives into the tank. There’s a lot of atmosphere
to travel through and very little water to strike.
As Peart’s rigid body slightly turns in the air
before reaching its destination, one’s heart is
brought into one’s mouth by the feat. Madame
Antonio is a charming artist in the first place, and
a thriller afterwards. Her trapeze work is the
refinement of gymnastics. Sometimes she is a
poem, sliding imperceptibly down a rope. When
Madame puts one foot in a noose and is carried
up 40 yards to a trapeze in the dome, waving a
graceful farewell to everybody meanwhile, she
might easily be mistaken for an angel ascending
to the Golden Shore. Presently Madame is seen
standing on the far-away trapeze. She falls
negligently backwards, makes two languid revolu-
tions in the air, and pops up smiling in the net
prepared to receive her. The Bulletin heard a
lawyer remark that it was “ a shame ” to let the
lady do it. Seven or eight thousand other people
didn t object. They looked pale, but happy,
k* * *
“Joseph,” at Melbourne Hoyal, seems
likely to win a large measure of religious respect
and steady support. Bible characters presented
on the stage must be convincing or ridiculous, so,
seeing that the gallery regards George Rignold’s
fine spectacle with awe and satisfaction, there can
be no doubt that himself and his brethren,
together with the Potiphars, royal Pharaoh, and
the rest of the company, have taken hold of their
lines in the right spirit and done their level
best for the reverend adapter of Holy Writ.
“Joseph” is not a lively play, but it moves im-
pressively and carries its oriental garments as
though born to the manner of long, long ago.
Also, it is loaded up with ancient and not un-
wholesome morality. Mrs. Potiphar, for instance,
makes atonement for her little indiscretion by
ultimately stabbing a conspirator in the liver, a
sort of repentance which would not hold good in
law nowadays. “Joseph’s” scenic magnificence
was duly extolled in these columns during the Syd-
ney season; wherefore a further burst of admira-
tion is not required. Every loyal Hebrew ought to
feel bound to take at least one “ liker ” at his
father Jacob, and no Gentile can conscientiously
avoid the show. Parson Haskett Smith testifies
to its Scriptural realism. The Bulletin recom-
mends “Joseph ”as a corrective to the vanity and
vexation of the present racing season,
** * *
The revival of “The Shop Girl,” decorated
with a few local verses and gags, is much about
the same brainless festival as previously. Elton
is the new Mr. Hooley, but the difference between
brisk W'lham and massive Monkhouse calls for
no particular joy or regret. Hooley, judging from
the fact that two experienced comedians of oppo-
site types have failed to make him interesting, is a
hopeless ease. On Saturday the sweet visions of
the co. will be seen again in “The Gaiety Girl,”
and then perhaps Melbourne will accept this best
of the musical comedies at its full value. When
“The Gaiety Girl” first adorned the Princess’s
stage its airy satire floated over the heads of the
masses, who had been expecting a burlesque.
Now that they have learned to digest the alleged
humor of a “ Gentleman Joe,” they are likely to
rush at “The Gaiety Girl” with open mouths,
and smack their lips as the dainty morsel goes
down.
** * *
Pastor Walters, because his Biblical play,
“Joseph of Canaan,” has been a moderate suc-
cess, shows symptoms of being stage-struck. As
he meditates going to England, we may yet hear
of him playing Joseph. Mr. Walters should “lay
to his book,” and remember how G. C. Miln gave
up a Chicago church billet of 10,000 dols. a year
“and he hasn’t been well since.” Also,"Mr.
Walters should apply an ice-cap to his swollen
head. If English and Yankee managers think
there is anything in Biblical plays, there won’t be
a single Biblical dramatic situation left unworked
in six months. The good pastor’s play contains
no memorable dialogue ; whatever success it has
made is mainly due to the idea of the thing—and
there is no copyright in mere ideas. By the time
the Rev. G.W. gets to England he will probably
find in full blast a scintillating piece entitled
“ Mrs, Potiphar’s Young Man,” or something like
that.
At Poverty Point .
Grace Palotta, according to a Melbourne paper, has a
most extraordinary liking for monkeys, and frequently
visits the local Zoo to feed and admire the animals caged
there. This announcement will probably be the means of
inducing many local johnnies and bounders to throw off
ail disguise and take to the trees again in the soulful hope
of having nuts thrown them by Palotta.
Geo. Rignoid now advertises “Joseph of Canaan” as
“by Rev. Geo. Walters, with managerial cuts and emerr
dations by Mr. George Rignoid.” Which pompous pro-
clamation reminds one of “ A novel by W. M. Thackeray,
punctuated by J. Smith, the printer’s devil.”
The penultimate Gaiety Girl season at Melb. Princess’s
was florally barren; this lime the men only get the
parsley wreaths. The Gee-Gees (fern.) have suffered from
a flowery famine throughout. Bradfield, with several
unwieldy horseshoes to bis credit, and Fred Kaye, are the
most bouqeted. The latter lias an ui k iown admirer who
sends him a cabbage, made of lamp-vhade paper and tied
with pink ribbons, about twice a week.
There is a striking unanimity about the themes of the
“Gentleman Joe” songs. The keynote is “stockings.”
When the fifth Gaiety fairy comes on and sings, “ She
showed all her storking and wasn’t it shocking,” or words
to that effect, exhibiting at the same time a very modified
amount of frill to point the remark, the tiling” begins to
pall on the average spectator who has seen “Morocco
Hound,” &c. A ditty on the subject of “ socks” would
be a distinct relief. But, then, there is no comedy, only
tragedy, in socks.
Peart’s tank, in Fitzgeralds’ circus, measures 13ft. by
nine, and he dived from a height of 45 yards into it in
Melbourne on Monday night.
Me b. amateurs rolled up to give Scot Inglisagreat
reception the first night of Mrs. Polipliar. It was in

The logs of variety expected from the pooling of the
cable-services doesn’t apply to Tasmania. Three dally
papers in that cheerful province break the monotony
thus:
“ Messrs. Williamson and Musgrove have engaged Misa
Courtice Pounds, the American actress, for six months,
as leading lady in their Australian company, and she sails
for Melbourne on Thursday next.”—Mercury Cable.
‘‘Mr. Williamson, of Messrs. Williamson and Musgrove,
has engaged Courtice Pounds, the clever variety actor
and dancer, for a six months' tour in Australia. The
artist sails on Thursday for Melbourne.”—Telegraph
Cable.
“Mr. Wilkinson has agreed vvitli Mr. Courtice Pounds,
the well-known Savoy tenor, for a six months’ engage-
ment. Mr. Pound sails on Thursday.”- Examiner Cable.
Tub Bulletin hears, on the most unreliable authority,
that “Mr. Wilkinson’s” new acquisition is a Stiake-
sperian drama called “Poultice Found,” which is ex-
pected to draw satisfactorily.
H. J. Whittington, many years treasurer of Adelaide
Royal, and known to all pros., lias been seriously ill in
Adelaide hospital. A ben. is being arranged for “.Dick,”
who has had bad luck lately.
Mahomet, the Fitzgeralds’ talking horse, does one trick
that is certainly above suspicion. Anyone in the audience
is allowed to write a number under 10 on a slate held by
an attendant, and the horse stamps the answer with bis
feet. The trick seems to lie in the manner of holding the
slate.
Martin Simonsen— Whose ghost occasionally walks the
streets of Melbourne—was once violinist by appointment
to the King of Denmark. There is a legend that while at
the Court of Copenhagen he knew Yoiick.
The Lucy Chambers’ monument subscription resulted
in a surplus, part of which- after the monument was paid
for—was spent in setting up a memorial bed in St. Vincent
Hospital and the rest given to the Musical Fund. This
case is almost unique. As a rule, when a popular favorite
dies the public gets drunk on its own tears at the funeral
and solemnly vows to erect a memorial pyramid, and on
the day after sobers up, and doesn’t see its way to sub-
scribe to the purchase of a little wooden cross or tin
immortelle.
It was on explorer Stanley’s recommendation that
Mark Twain placed himself under the charge of the
"Much-Travelled.” And therein is a curious coincidence.
Mark wrote to Smylhe inquiring terms, and had not
posted his letter three days when along came a note from
R.S. stating exactly what he wanted to know and com-
mencing : “Dear Mr. Clemens, —lt is so long since Archi-
bald Forties and I spent that pleasant afternoon in your
comfortable house in Hartford that you have probably
forgotten the occasion.” M.T. rejects the theory that
tiiis was a mere coincidence.
Fred Kaye acted Nick Vedder, in “ Rip Van Winkle,’
for nine months, with Leslie as Rip, ail over Britain, •
Melbournian: Fitzgeralds’ wonderful show is only
lacking in amusement as (distinguished from amazement.
Fred Kaye’s fat humor tickled them quite a deal in the
early evenings of “ Gentleman Joe ” at Melbourne, but it
was found that his fooling was distracting attention from
the galvanic Bradtield, and subsequently Frederick “ let
up," turned in his toes, and was only* nbgalively humorous.
If you are merely second fiddle in a combination, you
must be careful to behave as such, and trot take any of the
shine out of the star.
The Eclairs, whose humorous contortion act is one of
the most fetching novelties in Fitzgerald Bros.’ new show,
are both of them short, square, nuggetty men. Their
figures, in every-day garb, give no suggestion of an abnor-
mal capacity for getting out of joint. One would guess
the Eclairs to be weight-lifters, or human-pyramid sup-
porters, or anything but what they are.
Johnny Toole’s theatre has just about ceased to exist
by this time, and J.L.T., as a London actor, is probably
passing out of knowledge along with his band-box of a
house.
H. B. Conway, a fashionable-beauty actor in his time
(which wasn't so long ago, either), seems to be going the
way of Harry Montague and other “ducks of men.” At
Birmingham, tlie other week, he took laudanum,
but subsequently repented and rang for the chamber-
maid. Prompt medical treatment pulled him round.
Conway’s excuse for the opium was the severity of local
press notices of his Ned Annesly performance in “ Sowing
the Wind.” The truth is said to have been that he came
drunk upon the stage, and got his walking-ticket next
morning.
Some excellent Living Pictures have lately been shown
at church gatherings in the St. Hilda (Melb.) district,
under the management of Fred. Chamberlain, a clever
young amateur scenic artist. Considering that these
pictures are staged in school-rooms, right under the noses
of the audience, they are wonderfully effective.
Dear Bulletin, —There’s nothing unusual though
“ Sappho Smith ” may not be aware of this well-known
fact—about the case of Courtice Pounds, a church boy-
soprano who has developed into a successful musical man.
Arthur Sullivan and Alfred Cellier, as youngsters, sang
in the choirs at St. Paul’s Cathedral and Westminster
Abbey. Solomon (the “Vicar of Bray” composer) was
onetime a little glee-warbler at Evans’s supper-rooms.
Edward Lloyd was a surpliced soprano in the first place,
as likewise a dozen other well-known English vocalists.
Armes Beaumont’s voice is said to have graduated
at a tabernacle. A choir-hoy, by the way, is not a
“prodigy,” like a “calculating boy,” but merely an
ordinary result of careful tuition in music theory
and voice production. A cathedral choir-master takes
any eight-year-oid urchin who comes along, and licks
him into shape according to his natural intelligence.
Having licked the boy into shape, his master, as a rule,
proceeds to knock his voice to pieces as soon as it cracks,
instead of letting him preserve it for future use. If the
average tutor didn’t eventually ruin the young voices he
has educated, and more particularly ruin the best of
them, there would be very little room on the concert-
platform, or operatic stage, for any artists other than ex-
ohoir-boys.—Yours, Verger.
Nellie Stewart starts an American tour, under engage-
ment to Geo. Edwardes, Dec. 24.
Ada Crossley was first “discovered” by F. C. Mason,
Chairman of Committees of Vie. Assembly, when she
was singing in the church choir of a little Gippsland bns’i
town. It was he who induced her people to send her
to Melbourne, and got every member of the House to
subscribe to her benefit.
Melba’s threatened book on the art of singing, from
the point of view of her own experiences, lias caus-d
quite a flutter amongst the teachers. She declares that
every book used, up till hers, is wrong. She says, by
the way, that it was the Pall Mall Gazette which fi s'
discovered the powers of her voice and prophesied Im r
future greatness.
The Dean Case.—The Alleged
Truth at Last.
Surprise follows surprise in tlie Dean case. There
was a tremendous sensation in N.S. W. Assembly
when, on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Crick am-*
and made it known that his partner. Mr.
Meagher, Dean’s attorney, had at last ad-
mitted to him that the alleged poi-
soner, Dean, had, after the trial, and I cfoie
the sittings of the Commission, cnnf sed
his guilt to him (Meagher). Mr. M-uglier
has resigned his seat in Parliament, and is pre-
pared to take the consequences of the tori nuns
course pursued by him in regard to this m. mumble
case. Much sympathy was f. It and expiess. rl for
Mr. Crick. Dean has been re-arrested on a charge
of perjury.
A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the’ appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback- the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex
tracted, so that now a beautiful comph x'on of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

Visitors to the Spouting Spring at Heli-
don, 70 miles from Brisbane, are always astounded
at the quantity of water they can consume at the
Spring. Ten or 12 tumblers in an hour or so are
taken with comfort. The reason is that the
tissues of the body are absorbing the water all the
time. Something beneficial is always added to
the system by every glass of Helidon Spa water
consumed. Messrs. Tooth and Co., Kent
Brewery, are the Sydney agents.

News of the Week,
Amongst the events of importance this week are ;
The continued rise in value of wool; next, the
bountiful rainfall which has turned deserts into
pastures, and, which combined with the increased
price of our staple commodity, means millions for
this colony; then the Dean case is exciting more
public interest than ever owing to latest dis-
closures ; but the most important matter to the
public is the receipt of news to the effect that
though the supply of the popular B.L. Corto
Rothschild Cigars is very short at present the im-
porters have, at great expense, secured a further
shipment, which will be to hand next week. The
B.L. Corto Rothschild are the best and most
popular 6d. cigar in Australia.*
The Wild-Cat Column .
N.b.W. ia about to float in London a £4,000,000
loan at 3 per cent., and the present signs are tliat it will
be the most successful financial operation performed up
to date by any Australian province. Premier Keid lias
enormous luck in this resp a ct. The price of money in
London is about at the lowest figure on record ; it lias
even got perceptibly lower since the Maoriland 3 per cent,
loan was put on the market a few months ago. The
£4 000,000 is wanted mostly for redemption purposes.
On’lst January, '96, £219,400 of 5 per cent, debentures
and £1,000,000 of 4 per cent. Treasury bills fall due ;
£768 000 of 5 per cent, debentures fall due on
Ist July, ’96; and another £1,000,000 of 4 per
cent. Treasury bills and £750,000 of 44 per cent,
ditto are repayable on Ist October, ’96. This makes a
total of £3,727,400, and after allowing for expenses of
flotation, the Treasurer will probably have £150,000 left
towards forest-thinning and building the Bogan bridge
at Monkey. Yet the £4,000,000 (if the loan is a success,
whioh seems tolerably certain) will cost only £120,000 a
year interest, whereas the £3,727,400 of old loans cost
over £160,000 a year. These are the good features of the
arrangement. * * •
The bad ones are as follows ; The loan is for 40
years certain; it falls due on a fixed date in the old
foolish way, instead of being an interminable loan with
power of repayment at the option of the Government
after a certain number of years. It adds £1,000,000 to
the foreign indebtedness of New South Wales, and re-
duces the local indebtedness by £750,000, so the province
i 8 so much the further away from the time when
it will be independent of the British lender. No
attempt has been made to raise any of the money locally,
so Q. H. Reid’s statement that he didn’t think it advisable
to increase the country’s foreign obligations, and that he
wanted to rely on the local market, is evidently only
windy rhetoric. Also, nothing is said about putting the
£4O 000 annually saved in interest to a sinking-fund for
the ultimate extinction of the loan, and putting that sink-
ing-fund in a place where the Treasurer can’t get at it—
if there is such a place. But, then, no one expected any-
thing of the kind, so there is no special cause for disap-
pointment. * * •
The Melbourne Board of Works has floated
another £500,000 loan locally at 4 per cent., with an 18
years’currency. The price realised was £lO4 4s. 7d., so
that the board'really gets the money at about £3 12s. per
cent., allowing for the profit on repayment. If N.S.W.
Government gets its S per cent, loan in London at £96
net—and considering the heavy charges therefor stamp-
duty commission, &c., this will be a high figure—it will
pay rather more than £3 4s. 6d. per cent., including the
final loss on repayment, and will also have to pay con-
siderable annual charges for remitting interest, manage-
ment in London, &c. Considering that the province of
NSW offers so much better security than a mere local
board, and that it gives 40 years’ currency instead of 18,
it seems certain from these figures that Premier Reid
could ha e got his loan almost as cheaply in Australia as
in London, and the after-savings in expenses would pro-
bably have made it quite as cheap—possibly even a shade
cheaper. Also, the dividends would have been subject to
income-tax, while the London divs., owing to the stupid
and unpatriotic preference given to the foreign lender in
the Income Tax Bill, are not. Further local flotation
would have furnished an investment for much of
the bank reserves which have now to be kept idle for
want of liquid securities, so that it would have been
a direct cause of prosperity in New South Wales ; and, in
the local market, the money could have been more con-
veniently raised in instalments as it was wanted, whereas
bv the present arrangement the country loses about
£50,000 by paying interest on money borrowed long
before there was any necessity for it. Altogether, the
time Was so opportune that a Treasurer with any sem-
blance of pluck would at least have made the attempt to
borrow locally.

The Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society
has just finished its quinquennial investigation, and re-
ports a cash surplus of £236.870. Of this amount
£5l 311 is to be set aside as a reserve to cover possible
depreciation, £63.103 is carried forward, £5887 is written
oft securities, and £105,896 is divided among the policy-
holders. These provisions make a reserve for deprecia-
tion of nearly £3 ss. per cent, on the investments of the
Society. The A.M.P. has a reserve fund equal to £3 4s. per
cent or just about the Colonial Mutual’s figure. The
National Mutual has a reserve of £2 4s. per cent., the
Maoriland Government Department £2 per cent, (though
in its case most of the funds are invested in State
securities, and the mortgage item, where the losses mostly
come in, is very limited, therefore its reserve is much
belter than it looks). The Mutual of Victoria, according
do last balance-sheet, had a reserve of 13s. 4d. per cent. ;
while the Widows’ Fund had only 6s. 3d. to cover possible
■depreciation on each £lOO of assets. The Mutual Life
Association’s last balance-sheet shows no reserve what-
ever. The Colonial Mutual has thus taken about the most
solid precautions of the lot, and, in these lamentable
dimes, it has done wisely.
During the five years the funds have increased
from £1,050,573 to £1,793,628-an advance of three-
.quarters of a million ; and the ratio of expenses to pre-
miums has been reduced by nearly 6 per cenl. The bonus
as quite as large as could be expected considering that
the Colonial Mutual charges the lowest premium rates in
Australia. During the 21 years of its existence the
society has paid £1,405,000 in claims, and the total
amount of its present insurances is 10J millions. Alto-
gether, the report is highly satisfactory, save perhaps in
one respect. The Colonial Mutual apparently still bases
its calculations on the assumption that its funds will earn
in the future an average of 4 per cent, interest. All the
other Australasian societies, save the A.M.P., estimate on
the same, or on an even higher basis, and the fact that the
funds actually realise a good deal over 5 per cent, makes
the calculation look absolutely safe. Nevertheless, there
has been of late a dull, sickening thud in interest-rates,
and it seems just possible that the 4 p a r cent, estimate
may leave a somewhat narrow margin a few years hence.
The A.M.P., which adopted the same st andard I ill very
recently, is now getting down by degrees to 3.,, and the
other offices should do likewise. It will he much cheaper
to make the descent by slow instalments now than to do
it all in one act later on.

The Colonial Finance, Mortgage, Investment
and Guarantee Co. (Sydney), reports, in a pained tone of
voice, that, though the paid-up capital lias been increased
during the past year from £125,000 to £137,000, nothing
else of a cheering nature has happened. The net loss
during the year has been £7951. The C.F.M.I. and G.
Co., like most of its kind, is choked with unsaleable free-
hold properties, hut it is arranging to sell them in a lump
to the Equitable Building Society of Brisbane for disposal
on the lottery dodge principle. Should this transaction
come off it will be clear of its present difficulties, and
then it proposes to make a fresh start and walk a chalk-
line for the future.

The Victorian Government is importing a
Yankee tobacco-growing expert and a Maoriland cheese-
making expert, to give instruction to the Victorian
farmers, with a view to improving the quality of the local
produce. It is also importing the best varieties of sugar
beet seed, and is sending an expert round to give
information as to the most profitable melhodsof growing.
At present low prices there is little to be made by tear-
ing crops out of the ground for export to England, but if
by helping along the beet industry it is possible to save
th a £500,000 per annum which goes out of Victoria to
pay for imported sugar, the province will he much the
richer. Toe local market is always more profitable than
the one at the other end of the globe, and the 'cry
rational object of the Vic. Government is to work it for
ail it is worth.

How J. Bull falls in. An Australian mine (a
really valuable asset) is sold to Scotch syndicate for just
under £30,000 cash. New manager of the haw-haw type
takes charge. Spends a few thousands in well-meaning
endeavors to woo the sullen metal. Finally, in disgust,
the mine is sold back to original owner for about £2500.

From London, and from a man who knows Ids

and were sore ab 'Ut it. Ashcroft’s process to solve the

The Auckland (M.L.) gold-boom has now

are floated and the shares rushed up to a big premium.

B.H. Proprietary is still under a heavy cloud,
despite the payment of a bonus additional to the 100th
div. The fire in Block 11 continues to smoulder ; and, in
consequence of the persistent sinking of the floor of the
big open-cut (beneath which the fire broke out) the Govt,
mines inspector has ordered work there to close. Partly
on account of fhe dislocation of operations caused by
this fire, suitable ore for milling is not immediately avail-
able, and so the amalgamating plant was shut down last
week. Meantime the mine underground continues to be
raked for smelting lead ores.
Central (8.H.) made a profit of .£19,923 last
half-year, of which £11,052 was distributed in divs. To
produce this result 13,731 tons of ore were sold and 12,514
tons were smelted. But products unrealised and sums yet
to be drawn will probably bring the total to about £21,000
or £22,000, so that a profit of approximately 17s. per ton
has been made. It must, however, be remembered that
the co. has been running two smelting furnaces for
several months, but it has now been found impossible to
continue doing so.
Junction (8.H.) still develops well; though it
does strike one that the directors are most careful that
the public shall know the fact—a solicitude very rare in
these days. Still, the lode, opened up at 550 ft. in new
country, is worth talking about ; it is, besides being big,
one of the best-looking bodies now showing along the line.
Large parcels of these shares have been bought up lately
for foreigners.
A lot Of 523 tons of North B.H. sulphides has
been tried on the South mill wit h very satisfactory results.
The stuff is easy of treatment, and gave 170 tons concen-
trates, assaying in bulk 69 per cent, lead, Boz. silver, and
7 per cent. zinc.
As against the higher return for the “dry ” and
lead-smelting ores at Broken Hill must, however, be put
the much higher cost of winning these classes by com-
parison with the sulphides. General-manager Adams, of
the Central, shows that while it cost only 7s. lid. per ton
to raise the ordinary sulphides last half-year, it cost 14s.
Id. per ton to get out the carbonates, and 16s. Bd. the
dry ore.
Central (8.H.) proposes to begin the erection of
a concentrating mill. By the deed, this co. is to be
allowed tor any improvements made up to £5OOO in the

can ” syndicate. The first term of the offer expires on
28th Oct., by the way.

Great Boulder —last crushing, 345 tons, 18790 z.
Not up to the average, but quite good enough for any-
thing if it lasts ; though it is strange to have so big a
drop after so many yarns to the effect that the next
crushings were going to be bigger than ever. In mining,
however, it is always the next crushing that is going to
make the cake. Z"b. Lane tells a Ooolgardie P^P® 1-
that after examining the mine in ’93 he told bis friends in
England that it was “ good enough,” and his judgment
was supported by that of Begelhole, “ who is said to be
one of the best mining experts in the world.” Itis.no
doubt, somewhat painful to he reminded of the fact that
there were quite a number of other Ooolgardie mines con-
sidered good enough by one or other, if not both, these
gentlemen. What, for instance, has become of the
Empress of Ooolgardie, Cashman’s, the Great Ooolgardie,
&c., &c. ? True, the Great Boulder looked the sickest of

One Woodhouse, who says he has been to South
Africa, is convinced that the W.A. goldfields will nOt be
surpassed by any others lie has seen. Mr. W. is evidently
a smart man, asi on his own authority, we have it that the
new find at the 100 ft. level of the Londonderry was got
at the very spot he had indicated less than 48 hours
before. A different individual, of similar name, not. many
months ago said at Ooolgardie that the gold which was
then being got would not pay for the whisky drunk on
the field.

A Ooolgardie wire: “The option on.the

taken under offer by another co. at a large figure. Tins

that is the reason the other people forfeited.

The last clean-up of the Day Dawn, Cue, 900 oz.
for a six weeks’ run of 20 stamps. Plates scaled again.
Deduct, say, 200 oz. for plates, and it gives a little over

Armstrong is leaving, and a cyanogist is en route to run

Neglected Wood’s Point (Vic.) owns a promising
mine in the Hope, developing the diorite dyke on the
Morning Star Hill, one of the rich pots of the aforesaid
field in its famous days. Then, from a few reefs above
the water, a million oz. gold were taken, and the drill has
proved the reefs to recur every 60 or 100 ft. iu the dyke.
Hope’s last crushing went ISdwts., and the stone now
stamping will, it is said, go over the ounce. “Johnny”
\\ allace owns the hulk of the shares. There are 10,000
paid-up and 20,000 contributing called up to Bs. Sd.
Directors are compiling a reserve—hence the postpone-
ment of divs. Another seemingly good show on the Hill
is the New Morning Star, which will not reach the Hope
stage of development lor some months.

The Corinna Co. has had another poor clean-up.

Mt. Lyell stocks are now the chief bite in
Melb. Shares in the big mine are well on the way to £6—
at which figure the market-value of the property would
he a million and a-half ; sanguine holders are whispering
in each other’s ears they will see double the money—the
anticipation being (bat more foreign capital will be avail-
able for this stock. If the writer were a holder he
wouldn’t lock up his scrip till that happened. Big smelt-
ing plant now in course of erection, and until that la
working the question of divs. must be adjourned. And it
must not lie forgotten that the Mt. Lyell pyritic-smeltlng
plan is a pure experiment.
Syndicate blocks fringing the aforesaid pro-
perty, or within cooee of it, are having a sympathetic
“ buck.” North and South Lyells have had their spurt,
and last Friday King Lyells and Queen Lyells jumped
from £l6 to £33 and £3 to £9 ss. respectively. Out of

of coin. Chiltern Valley United, turning out 1500 oz.

Re the announced sales of Johnson’s Reef mines,
the writer is assured there is “nothing in it.” When
approached the directors told Lansell’s ostensible London
buyer that the shareholders would chew over a £lOO,OOO
offer, and he retaliated with £75,000. No consideration.
Johnson’s is a property, judging from past performances,
that may come again any day. Eleven years elapsed
between its first and second div.-eras, and up to date it has
returned £lll2s. 9d. on each of the 28,000 shares paid-up
to £2 17s. 6d. In No. 2 mine, with another 100 ft. driving,
they expect to out the Princess Dagmar reef, now show-
ing a little gold. , , ,
A British buyer, piloted by George Lansell, has,
it is said, annexed a couple of promising Bendigo mines,
and he is also nibbling at the United Devonshire and
New Chum Railway, where, by the way, the heat in the
2878 ft. level has caused suspension of work. Expected
the difficulty will be got over by drawing a supply of cool
air from the' ladder-shaft, which, for that purpose, will
be boxed in from 1200 ft.

The situation this week in regard to the
eternal Dean problem is that Want still says that
Salomons told him that Meagher told him that
Dean told him that he had administered the
poison. Also, Salomons says that he did tell
Want, and that he also told Pilcher, Simpson, and
Cecil Stephen ; and Pilcher, Simpson, and Cecil
Stephen are all apparently agreed Jthat Salomons
told them. Meanwhile, Dean still asserts most
emphatically that he didn’t tell Meagher, and
Meagher still declares that he didn’t tell
Salomons, and the fact that Salomons told three
other people besides Want doesn’t strengthen his
case in the least, seeing that the statement that
Meagher told him still rests wholly on Salomons’s
own assertion. Also, even it could be proved abso-
lutely that Meagher told Salomons, which is
obviously impossible, the question would promptly
knock up against another hopeless dead-
wall in the impossibility of proving that Dean
ever told Meagher, On the other hand, there is
no possible means of proving that Dean didn’t tell
Meagher or that Meagher didn’t tell Salomons,
and even if the parties yell at each other on the
present basis for 40,000 years they will never get
any “forrarder.” Prolmbly the most effective
way to settle the question is for the principal dis-
putants to sit down in a warm place, each with a
lump of sugar before him, and the oner whose lump
of sugar gets a fly on it fir.-t to take the pool.
* * •
. The Jaxt trouble is that a certain chemist who
is alleged to have been worried into a confession
by his conscience, assisted by a clergyman, is said
to have told something in 30 foolscap pages to
Attorney-General Want, and Want told a de-
tective, and then the force went out and solemnly
Crick, Meagher and Dean for “con-
spiracy.” The statement was made on Friday
evening, and the arrest took place on Saturday,
and then for 10 solid hours every newsboy in
Sydney bellowed the information till he almost
dropped from sheer exhaustion. The speed with
which the Government moved in this case, when
it was a matter of proving that an influential
.fudge had been right after all, contrasts remark-
ably with its extreme slowness in the Butler con-
spiracy, which was a case of proving that an in-
fluential Judge had been very far wrong indeed.
Iso, the authorities seemingly did their level
best to “ rub it in ” to their ancient enemy, Crick,
by issuing warrants instead of proceeding by
criminal summonses which, for all proper pur-
poses, would have been just as effective ; and
a vigorous protest was made by a Crown Law
official against the granting of bail, in which case
Crick ami Meagher would have been locked up
until their trial. Bail is ordinarily only refused
in capital cases and when there is supposed to be
serious risk of the accused bolting. The three
accused,Jor whom plenty of bondsmen were forth-
coming, were, however, all bailed out, and for
hours after their release excited citizens kept
arriving in cabs to offer more bail. And now
Dean is a bigger draw’ on the Mosmah’s Bay line
than ever,' and the Wallaby is loaded to the
water’s edge almost every trip, and every time it
conies into the wharf a frantic crowd points with a
grimy finger at the alleged conspirator at the
wheel, and fells his mate : “That’s ’im.”
Premier iteid was at Parramatta on Saturday
afternoon (Attorney-General Want was “away
fishing,” as usual), and is there alleged to have
accidentally learnt of the arrests. “He turned as
white as a ghost,” says the veracious chronicler.
Now, Mr. Reid may carry about with him the
useful capacity of turning as white as a ghost
whenever it suits him to play the innocent; or the
bull-headed members of his Ministry may have
manoeuvred to keep him in ignorance of the next
move in the game for fear his love of compromise
and dislike of violent measures would thwart their
plans. As Premier Reid doesn’t seem able to
blush, it is satisfactory to know that he can turn
white when it suits him.
* # #
The impression received by a number of
those who listened to Salomon’s now historic
speech, in reply to attorney Meagher, was that he
wished it clearly understood by people generally
that he was on intimate terms with the Almighty.
That the Deity and little Salomons would uphold
the right and ensure justice being done. That
the Deity need not feel in the slightest degree
uneasy, as it always had and would receive the
recognition and support of “ Sir Julian.” Also,
that Julian Salomons was indirectly the founder
of Christianity.
• # #
More than once in his Leg. Council speech
Pilcher, Q.C., asserted there “was only one
person in the world who knew whether Geo. Dean
was guilty or innocent, and that person was Geo.
Dean himself.” That, however, was only another
way of asserting Dean’s guilt, for if he were inno-
cent, Dean, for one, would know of the fact, and
the guilty person (or persons) would also know of
it. But, as according to the learned Q.C., Dean
alone in the world knows, therefore Dean must
be guilty. Q.E.D. “ Possum ” should ask Pilcher,
Q. for an apology.
* # •
Salomons, Q.C., regarded Meagher’s al-
leged confession of Dean’s supposed guilt as a
great and awful secret, which weighed him down
and tormented him in his dreams; and yet this
tremendous secret he related in as secret a manner
to his son-in-law, to C. B. Stephen, Pilcher,
R. E. O’Connor, Attorney-General Want, and
Chief Justice Darley. Despite this, and the fact
that all the gentlemen mentioned are married
men, the Q.C. professes to be astonished how the
“ rumor ” got about ? “ What is known to more
than one is no longer a secret.”
* * *
The Salomons - Meagher recriminatory
“Dean” speeches in N.S. W. Assembly put the
gallery hands on their mettle. On each occasion
the sanctum was inordinately crowded, and, as the
speeches were reported verbatim, the task of tak-
ing a creditable note with such confined elbow-
room was anything but easy. Salomons, Q.C., is
a “ teasing ” speaker. He may start a sentence
very slowly, and before it closes fly into an im-
passioned appeal of 180 or 200 words a minute.
• # #
About the only clear-cut crystal from the
Salomons-Meagher-Dean controversy:—“l came
to the conclusion that, whether Mr. Meagher said
this thing or that thing, Dean never said anything
to justify Mr. Meagher in saying it. . . 1
know as much about the case as my hon. friend,
or, perhaps, more, and I have formed the opinion’
as I have held all through, that Dean was not
guilty of the charge laid against him, and that
the evidence given, either at the trial or before the
Commission, signally failed to establish a case
which would justify any jury in convicting him.”

Sydney North Shore Ferry co. is deriving
much revenue from the people who travel to Mos-
man’s and back solely for the gratification of seeing
Wallaby Dean steer his ferry-boat. Dean is re-
garded by a large section of the community in the
same light as an exceptionally interesting fat
woman or two-headed calf, and the fare of 2d. is
considered an extremely reasonable charge for the

Apropos Mr. Loxton’s quarrel with the
Bean Defence Committee, it must not be forgotten
that Mr. Loxton is a practising barrister. It is
interesting to remember the tone and purport of
his speech at the first big Dean meeting at North
Shore.

The sanctified Gov. Buxton is alleged to
have invited General Booth to put up at Adelaide
Government House during his approaching visit.
This is a sign of how things will be during the
reign of the holy beer potentate. A cold atmos-
phere of prayer, exhortation and weak tea is
already settling down upon the land, and the dark
stiadow of Booth’s vast red nose lies heavy upon
Adelaide. A pale Governor in side whiskers who
calls society “ beloved brethren,” and asks if it is
prepared for death, will cause a lot of disloyalty.

adventuress M elanie Caswell, and Lucy Waters; and as

Bishop Goe and the Melb. R.C. clergy are
having a newspaper battle over the absurd ques-
tion as to whether Card, Newman “believed” in
the Pope’s infallibility, or merely “accepted ” the
dogma obediently ? And of such is the Kingdom
of Heaven, we are given to understand. When
these rev. teachers get to the Throne of Grace
their first care will be to find Jonah and ask him
if he really thinks he was swallowed by the whale.

An interesting episode occurred at Melb.
Govmentouse the other day when “society”
rushed the establishment to enter its name in
Gov. Brassey’s visiting-book just opened for the
big event. Two ladies, who were struggling for
conspicuous and commanding positions, suddenly
clashed and, with little squeals and passionate
remarks, began to pull wool, and claw, and tear
up each other’s millinery. The trouble arose over
a question of propriety, or precedence, or some-
thing, and was for a time continued with much
spirit. Jhe ladies finally gathered up their
rags and fled, breathing vengeance and weeping
bitter tears, bassiety is understood to be much
put about over the affair. The best people, it
seems, only excuse such exhibitions in the rush
for supper at gubernatorial balls.

Infuriated Good Templars of the whisker-
less sex write passionately to Melb. papers because
at a recent “ Vic. Alliance” tea-and-toast banquet
the order of the rush for the luncheon was
“gentlemen first, ladies to follow.” The angry
correspondents describe this as an insult to the
pettiooated Reohabites, almost sufficient to drive
them to drink, and demand to know why the sexes
were not sent up together. Needless to remark,
the Victorian Alliance is not that sort of alliance—
it is opposed to mixed bathing, and mixed drink-
ing, also mixed feeding. It is The Bulletin’s
opinion that the new order was wisely adopted
after due consideration had been given to the
voracity of the average teetotal female.

By the Order-in-Council in connection
with Vic. police sexagenarian officers, Chief Com-
missioner Chomley retains office for a further
term. There seems to be a difficulty in finding
a suitable man to succeed him, although, as there
is a general desire that he should continue in
command, no big effort was made. Several other
sexagenarians are also being retained. Mean-
while, the rank-and-file grumble at the block in
promotions caused thereby.

The real crux of the charge against the
three Melbourne constables “ potted ” in the
Synnot case lay in the precise part they played in
working up evidence. According to statements
made, and documents produced at the enquiry,
Constable Coffey got permission on specific terms
to gi\e certain information vc the alleged house of
ill-fame, at which Mrs. Synnot was falsely stated
to have been staying. Inspecting-Superintendent
Sad lei r was directed by Chief Commissioner
Chomley to hear what Coffey had to tell, and
if there was nothing objectionable in it, from a
police point of view, lie was to have permission
to impart his knowledge to solicitor Michie. This
permission was duly accorded. But Coffey went
much further than his authority warranted. He
Quilty to come into the case as well,
and Quilty subsequently got Coghlan. For which,
if any, of the other witnesses these men were res-
ponsible has not been clearly shown. It would
considerably help to settle the position of the dis-
missed policemen, either as scapegoats or scoun-
drels, if particulars of their records in the force
were published. For it is with men as with
horses, the best or worst view is taken of them
according to their previous performances.

Some of the Melb. cycling women are
having costumes that are by no means so slack in
the tit as are the orthodox “knickers.” Depend
upon it, the baggy pants are only the bashful and
tentative stage of the knicker movement. They
will get closer and closer in fit, and the day is not
tar distant when women with “ good legs ” (every
woman thinks she has good legs) will cycle in
tights. Beyond that, it is undesirable to see at
present.

Yea, madarne, draw your skirts aside
To let that “dreadful creature ” pass;
For what have you, a new-made bride,
In common with the “ fallen ’’ class?
At those who live in “ open shame,”
Unwedded wives, you look askance;
Yet how much better, save in name,
Your “ mariage de convenance ”?
Perchance they sinned through love at first,
That passion you have never known ;
A ou hold them now as things accurst,
And cast the Pharisaic stone.
And if they sell themselves for bread,
For shelter—aye, for greed alone,
Can you, unblushing, lift your head
And swear their sin is not your own ?
You have the sanction of the law —
Your loveless contract blessed in church ;
You walk discreetly that no flaw
Your reputation may besmirch.
Yet, who are you to utter slurs,
And yon poor harlot to despise?
The diff’rence’twixt your fall and hers
Is but —the value of the prize 1

Presbytery, re the question of appointing laymen
to the Moderatorship :
Mr. Stewart considered that, in view of things that had
occurred in the commercial world, it would be a vast mis-
fortune it a name were brought forward, and some of
them had to stand up to say: “No, we could not con-
sistently accept such a man to be placed over us. Till
memories should have died down the safest thing to do
would be to continue the present practice. (Hear, hear).
Tiiis lamentable impression prevailed, and a con-
viction that of all the pious Presbyterians in trade
in Smellville not one just man can be found who
could be trusted to business-manage the Pres-
bytery—even undertime auditorshipof the Trinity -
squelched the proposed reform. The Presbyterian
layman is so-called from his little way of “laying

A Westralian jeweller and mining-pioneer
died lately, leaving a young and handsome widow
and some children. By his will, he directed that
the widow was to have the life-use of his estate,
and the children the remainder; but if she re-
married she was to lose everything. She did re-
marry, like every other handsome young widow
at any rate, she went through a form of marriage
in S.A. with her deceased husband’s brother.
Such marriages are illegal both in S.A. and W. A.,
and the Westralian Supreme Court has held that
the lady is still a widow, and entitled to enjoy the
income from her late husband’s estate. Which
decision, as virtually upsetting the tyrannous
terms of the will, is most satisfactory.

The practice of hiring out “harmless”
lunatics from the local asylum has become popular
at Sunbury, Vic. One local family engaged an
amiable, matronly crank for her “keep, ’ and
were delighted with their bargain for a while, as
the “ patient ” would start working at day-
light, and go on without pause for rest or
refreshments unless turned off at the main. But
one day, when washing, she dreamily dipped a
billy of boiling water out of the copper, and
poured it over the baby sitting near, and then
cheerfully proceeded to grind the infant on a
washing-board. Wherefore, the cheap idiot is in
temporary disfavor at Sunbury.

“When sex ceases to beemphasised i n dress, the baser pas

The Anglican chaplain at Melb. cemetery
lately ventilated a galling grievance he has long
suffered at the hands of a man who runs Govt,
funerals by contract. The parson in question has
also a general retainer, under which he is called
upon to read the burial service over all Protestants
buried at State expense. Of late he has found,
however, that he was frequently being called upon
to perform professionally over Govt, corpses of
the R.C. persuasion, the religion of deceased
having been altered in the necessary documents
by that funeral contractor—by which act the con-
tracting chaplain was duped into piloting Romish
souls to Heaven ; whereas Romish souls are not
included in his schedule of souls, nor in the essence
of the contract he has, but count as extras, as it
were, and should be paid for as such. The funeral
contractor was fined for his unseemly conduct, but
the contracting chaplain gets nothing for those
extras. The Bulletin sees for him no resource
but to go to the graves and recall his consoling
remarks, and withdraw the service he performed
by reading it backwards.

Words of wisdom (addressed to the clergy)
by Bishop Goe :
Let us be very jealous for the dignity of our pulpits—
(hear, hear)—let us not say in them, or invite others,
however great in name or note, who will say in them,
that which will cause a grin and a titter through the con-

Distinction in dress for the sexes
The pathway of virtue is blocking,
A gown simply teases and vexes
The soul that is swayed by a stocking :

Thus the plans of reformers are thwarted
By a foolish objection to knickers.

The breast of a damozel pretty
Can’t chasten the thoughts of her lovers,
If the coat of the charmer be petti.

Alternately blazes or flickers,
Till she crushes their amorous yearning
By patting her limbs into knickers.

Seductive to masculine feelings,

Expectant of spicy revealings ;
Or gaze with expression sardonic
At the gambols of gauzy high-kickers,
Though our love would be pure and platonic
If the ballet were put into knickers.

My Dear Moorabinda—
Manly Flower Show was not quite the usual
success, though, considering the season, the dis-
play made was a tin-pot marvel in its way. It
wan rather bad luck for the management that,
while the drought made even a spray of “ tickey ”
bush a priceless thing, it should also break up in
to spoil the show-attendance into the bargain,
ihe flowers were not seen to as great advantage
as m the Pavilion—the Aquarium hall is so close
2n a nd J bOXy ’ for one and > when the room was
"'led, you couldn't see the stalls properly. Also,
the odor of dying Australian wild flowers is not
the most pleasant thing in the world.
Mrs. J. Fallon’s stall was a very clever floral
model of the R.C. College, Manly. The pretty
Warnngah stall had two floral bikes for a trade-
mark, so why the stallholders didn’t seize the
opportunity of dispensing their beautiful wares,
clad—l mean the girls—in “ rational ” costume, is
another mystery. The reason can’t be that the
“ rational ” woman is too new for “Our Village ”
fa* X saw two biking by the pier, attired in
fladder-hke knickers, long-tailed coats, and hats
like felt periwinkles.
The Palace stall was an imposing floral edifice,
which rather swamped Mrs. Freehill’s Dutch-house
1 airy Bower” with waratahs on the roof, and
damsels in gowns the color of water-melon flesh
to sell the perishable goods therein. “ Esperanza ”
stall was a shady sort of nook, and the aquarium
tank was a study in those vegetables which toil
not neither do they spin, combined with a floral
bridge and a merely spectacular gondola. The
Acting-Governoress, with red roses in her bonnet
and accompanied by Miss Darley, dressed in the
color of: ti-tree bark, and squired by Captain
Dangar, opened the show smoothly—the only
hitches being that the second-prize bouquet was
handed to her instead of the first, by mistake.
By the way, anew juvenile industry was nipped
in the bud at the M.F.S.—small girls and boys
abstracting bouquets from the stalls and selling
them for their own profit! Young Australia
evidently believes in every child being its own
charity !
This yarn—alleged to be the true and ghastly
experience of a Sydney man of non-spookist ten-
dencies recently returned from ’Ome—l would like
to dedicate to a certain, learned Judge. It’s a
long story, an nature!, and wants turned-down
lights and hollow tones to make your flesh creep
properly ; and as you can’t get exactly that effect
with pen and paper, it’s best to condense. Mr.
Asterisk, the Sydney man aforesaid, was stopping
with soi;ne duke or other in an ancient baronial
hall, and as he was brushing his bald head on the
first night, preparing for dinner, he heard a tap at
the door. Opening it, he saw on the mat a
Johnnie in full evening dress who begged him to
exeuse being disturbed, but he was wanted directly
in the Blue Library, or the Purple Coal-hole or
somewhere of the sort. Mr. Asterisk followed
him at once, but was surprised to find the sur-
roundings outside his door quite different to when
he went in (it was before dinner, recollect), and
When at last his guide threw open a door and re-
yealed a pretty girl whom he had never seen
before, asleep, on a sofa, he wasn’t as surprised as
he felt when the Johnnie suddenly stabbed her to
the heart. Directly that happened, he found him-
self back in his own room still brushing his bald
head for dinner, and when he had finished dress-
ing and went down, the house was just as he had
left it, and no sign of either Johnnie or girl.
Content to treat the whole thing as a halluci-
nation due to something or other, he said nothing
to his host (it isn’t etiqaette to allude to visions of
violence in baronial halls—it’s as bad as freely
talking of tambourines in a certain society family
of Sydney), and the affair somewhat slipped his
memory—but imagine his horror, when adjourning
W1 j ( , anc L ther stranger, to meet, in flesh
and blood, the Johnnie and the maiden whom he
had seen in his alleged remarkable vision. They
were engaged, too, and apparently much attached to
one another. At first Mr. Asterisk (as I call him
though his name’s well-knoWn in Australia—but
men don t like to have the reputation of^beinir
dreamers of dreams unless they include the name
of the Oup-winner) thought to warn the lady or
advise the youth, but on second thoughts decided
to wait. He has returned to Australia and is
still waiting for the tragic denouement so unex-
pectedly revealed to him —a denouement for which
he can’t help living in hope, I’ll bet.
Thomas Walker’s alleged comedy-drama, “The
Hypnotist,’’ was last week put up for one horrible
night before a rather weird audience at Sydney
Standard Theatre—the happy hunting-ground
of amateurdom, by the way. The drama—in five
acts and fifteen scenes—did not hypnotise one to
any great extent. Everybody had a grievance
which required a great deal of explanation, and
one girl, with an awe-inspiring coiffure and a rigid
backbone, took her sorrows in such large mouth-
fuls that she suggested a hurried traveller trying
to eat a railway sandwich in five seconds. The
leading lady, on the other hand (she was billed as
large as the author), told her long and sinful story
in fox-terrier snaps. The maid-servant, Juliet, (in
real life, when a hireling turns up with a senti-
mental name like that her mistress promptly tells
her she always calls the housemaid Bridget) was
the most reasonable performer of them all.
Most of the men seemed to be trying to find their
way out (all except the author, who absolutely
revelled in the middle of the stage), and even the
hero s fearful and wonderful dressing - jacket
couldn’t entirely blind you to the fact that he
wasn’t a jeune premier every night of his life,
though, mind you, nobody short of Bernhardt
could have sent any of Mr. Walker’s sorry plati-
tudes home. _ How a man who can write such
dramatic fustian must envy the author of “ Blow
for Blow !”
The amateur actress is a difficult creature to
handle, and the higher she is in the social world
the harder she is to manage. A gifted lady, who
translates snappy French plays into adequate
English, has a really charming comedy on the
stocks which she wanted to get a good amateur
crowd to play. And she had them all readied up,
too—but when it transpired that one of the
characters was the hero’s mistress, the leading-
lady-to-be froze right up to her toupe, and re-
marked in measured tones, “ Certainly we know,
madaine, that such things unfortunately exist;
but, all the same, we cannot, of course, appear in
a play with such a character among the dramatis
personce. How lovely to know that Society—
where most of the spiciest on dits come from —
really has a vague idea that “such things do
exist! ”
There is no question that - such things do exist.
A yarn goes the rounds re a well-advertised
Southern politician that his dove-cotes are
dotted here, there, and everywhere. At a
parliamentary ceremony held not long ago
it is said that all these nymphs assembled
to witness the public; gyrations of their adorer,
though, of course, the gold-washed lady in blue
and pink stripes didn’t know the brunette in tan-
boots, or the red-haired girl with too much cos-
metic on her freckles. One of these ladies tore off
to the festival in such a hurry, and in such new
clothes, that the price-tags were still pinned on
her garments.
I am rather surprised to hear of the squabble
between Joseph Rignold and Rev. Geo. Walters
as to who is the true author of the dramatisation
of Moses best after-dinner story—“ Joseph of
Canaan. ’ One could more easily imagine Mr.
Walters boasting that he had most to do with the
magnificent staging, or in designing Maude
irotiphar Williamson’s pink temptation-garment,
than tnat Rignold should try to insinuate that he
had a hand in writing the pointless modern talkee-
talkee, which always struck me as being a
withered kernel in a fine, glossy nut. “Joseph of
Canaan ’ is well worth seeing, on account of the
extreme efficiency of his coat of paint, but you
feel that you want to get away from his misfit
language now and then.
Apropos of George Rignold, the extreme virtue
of his parting speech, thanking his friends and
(non) supporters for the awful handicap of a silver
tea-and-coffee set to people bent on travelling,
and summing up his career at Her Majesty’s, was
rather funny, especially to people who had had
the pleasure of hearing the prudish George (he
who scorned to stage frisky but paying plays 1)
unburden his soaring soul on a certain festive
occasion concerning the nakedness of his chorus-
girls.
Mam zelle Nitouche,” at Sydney Lyceum
last Saturday, was double-banked by an “Arca-
dian Eve, a bright and bubblesome trifle in which
Wallace Brownlow and Florence Young, most
artistically draped, appeared to great advantage.
In Mam zelle Nitouche,” Juliet Wray's Denise
was ala Nellie Stewart; it reminded me of a
shadow of Nellie (shadows often lengthen one’s
nose a bit, you know, and make other physical
alterations) which she had left behind, or for-
gotten to pack, or something ; for all Nellie’s biz
was served up again without sauce piquante. It
was certainly a smart copy for so recent an ama-
teur to give ; still, a touch of originality here and
there would have looked promising and been
gratefully received in front. In the “Fair
Indian ” scene, for example, Miss Wray wore a
different, more discreet costume than Nellie’s
Nautch draperies (which was possibly the reason
why Wallace Brownlow, whose Fernand was as
convincingly military and melodious as ever, left
the stage while she was raspily singing a waltz-
song, whereas he always sat around in Nellie’s
era), and she would have perpetrated a novelty
had she browned her face and arms and changed
her hair, instead of coming out h la Nellie to play
a freak Indian with golden locks and a pink-and-
white complexion.
Mark Hambourg’s Sydney season, with J. E.
Sykes for his guide, philosopher, and friend, pro-
mises to boom, and will be divided ’twixt the
Town and Centenary halls, provided the little
genius isn’t; consumed by his own sacred fire
meanwhile. Mark is a brilliant pianist, and yet
most women over 30 feel they’d like to be a
mother or a grandmother to him, just to coddle
him up. This spirit was so strong in one kind old
lady that, as the co. got into the carriage to go to
railway-station, after its last concert in.
Melbourne lown Hall, this motherly person
pushed forward and handed the second Ruben-
stein a bottle of liniment. “ I’ve heard yon suffer
from rheumatism,” she said, “so I thought I’d
bring you this bottle of stuff, for it’s a certain
relief. You’ll find full directions inside. Good-
bye.” Possibly the only time this incident has
been duplicated was when a certain well-known
singer, whose complexion is rather far-fetched in
the matter of pimples, was respectfully handed a
box ot pills by a practical admirer. Mark H. has
many admirers, by the way—the most original
being two young ladies, who wrote to him jointly,
asking for a photograph apiece. “If you cannot
send us one each,” they wrote, “one between us
will do. We 11 draw lots for it, or else do the
Solomon trick and cut it in two.”
A good attendance turned up on the first meet-
ing held in Sydney Town Hall to discuss
means of giving the popular and tuneful Annis
Montague (who shortly leaves for Honolulu) a
complimentary concert as a send-off. The Lyceum
Theatre has been kindly lent by Mr. J, C. Wil-
liamson, many offers of assistance have been
received, including one from the Comic Opera
Cos., and a strong committee, with ex-Mayoress
Manning as president and Miss Neill and Miss
Lily Neill hon. secs., is hatching the affair,
Kowalski will direct the musical programme, and
the whole thing promises prosperously. On Mon-
day nexti (14th) the Trench ball takes place at
oydney lown Hall, under the patronage and in
the presence of the A.V.R. people, who have
farther to go after these festivals now that they’re
living at home again while Government House
gets a few reviving strokes of striped paint as a
telling background for ’Ampden, The French
ball is sure to be a success.
Every woman is at heart ” —a missionary, and
when they massacre her in large quantities in
China, or have her on toast in the Cannibal
Island, she breaks out in a safer place next time
but break out she must or perish. Two English
virgins, at present visiting Australia, have come
to encourage the solid formation, with a flag fly-
ing on the top, of the Police Christian Institute—
for christianising the foorce is the newest idea
now that the Chinese have begun retaliating with
battle-axes. In the working-out the idea is much
more amusing and safer and more thrilling than
trying to wean a slant-eyed Chow from worship-
ping his ancestors. Policemen are frequently
handsomer especially the mounted variety, who
are alleged to drop into their skin-fit riding
trousers from a great height, as they cannot pos-
sibly get into them any other way. There used
to be an officer (on foot) at the corner of King and
George streets, who. in the opinion of the fair sex
of Sydney, only needed fewer clothes, a wash of
pipeclay and a pedestal, to be the Apollo Belvidere,’
He arrested the women wholesale—optically, at
least—but lam grieved to hear that the effect of
Sydney beauty was too much for him in the end,
for he committed suicide one morning. If police
missions had started in his time, what a rush
there’d have been to convert the King-st. Adonis!
I he Police Christian Institute is comprehensive,'
in its English, at least, for I read that “a pro-
vincial orphanage” has been established. But
how fortunate it hasn’t been hastily christened
9 unc^’n ß’ Asylum ? ” Even the known virtue
of the I orce and the pious fervor of the mis-
sioneress wouldn’t quite overcome the prejudice
there is against that style of establishment ? But
I really don’t see that the police want converting. •
People accredited with possessing a watch and ;i
terrace of houses apiece are generally pillars of the
church already.
It is a suspicious circumstance that most of the
women who pursue the soul of Policeman X
should be single—it is this singleness, by the way,
which is responsible for the crass ignorance dis-
played by those females who go evangelising
round the gaols. For instance, evangelists used
to go round to the various watch-houses on Sun-
day mornings with pails full of washy tea with the
object of slaking the burning thirst of the Satur-
day crop of inebriates to whom, at that juncture,
it would have been a real kindness to give a hair
of the dog that bit them. Heaps of damp bread-
and-butter were also laid on without mercy—the
result, I suppose, of so many bread-and-butter
misses having a hand in it. Though it may, after
all, have been due to the garden ignorance of the
average pious female who preserves her native
rawness whether she’s buried three husbands or
has never had even the ghost of one.
“ Why does my friend, Brown,” writes a man
to me, “appear to be dressed like a gentleman,
and his wife always like an upper servant of poor
taste? Why does Brown always look even in an
old suit as if he had been ordered for the suit, and
Mrs. Brown look as if her dress had been ordered
for someone else? Why does Mrs. Brown always
have a lot of little bits of things about her body
that don’t seem to belong either to her or to her
dress? These things have always puzzled me. I
wish Mrs, Brown could look more at home in her
clothes ; also I wish that she would not change all
the funny little things about her dress for another
set of funny little things just as I have got used
to the old set.
“ 1 was beginning to think that I knew the use
of these big bows at the back of her neck when,
behold ! they have disappeared ; and now I don’t
know how she is to avoid that rheumatic nain
without the bow. She has now got some sort of
white muslin thing round her neck, and I have
not yet been able to settle what it is for. Oh,
I think she must be cutting her wisdom-teeth and
she is perhaps expecting to dribble, I do wish
some powerful statesman could regulate these
little things for Mrs. Brown, she is so very fluc-
tuating. Two years ago she wore quiet colors. I
was sometimes not quite sure when I saw her
coming round the corner whether it was not
Brown himself in the old grey suit; but this year
she has patches of bright colors in the most un-
expected places, and I wonder whether it is a very
large parrot that has been let out of a case by
accident.
“ I remember long ago I used to wonder how
she got out of her little tight sleeves ; and I can’t
help wondering how I am to get in at the same
door with these sleeves she is wearing' now.
Yesterday, when I met Mr. and Mrs. Brown at
the show there was a bit of a crush, and I got a
blow from some hard substance just on my funny-
bone. On looking round, the nearest thing was
that big sleeve, and it looked so soft and billowy I
•could not suspect it. I wonder if it has a hoop
below its undulating surface. It is not very long
ago that she had a hat with a crown no bigger
than an egg-cup ; and now her hat has a big soft
sort of crown that might cover a fair-sized brain.
1 wonder if her brain has grown recently. Oh,
i §'• U P’ have a sort of idea that if
she did not change the fashion of her clothes quite
so often maybe her architecture would be more
easy to master ; and, also, her clothes might in
time come to sit with some grace on her, as her
husband’s coat does on him.”
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
ihe managers of a Toorak church, which for
years topped the ‘Hospital Sunday ’ score, com-
plain bitterly of failing finances. Slowly but
surely, their staunchest supporters relinquish
their pews and depart to cheaper localities, hand-
ing over their ancestral mansions for protracted
terms to tenants, generally of Semitic origin—
most undesirable residents from the Kirk point of
view.”
ITours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
In Victorian Legislative Assembly, the
other evening, during the consideration of the
Estimates, Mr. Murray, M.P., drew attention to
the continued exclusion of The Bulletin from
the Parliamentary reading-room, notwithstanding
that 70 members out of 95 have signed a requisi-
tion for it to be placed there. Chief Secretary
Peacock promised that he would have the matter
seen to. Both Argus and Age, of course, omit
all reference to this matter. They love The Bul-
letin too much.

Dear Bulletin, — There has been a rubber-
tyred cab in Sydney for months. The owner it-
constantly going; in fact, I think you would haw
to give notice if you wished to engage him.—

In re Crick’s allegation that Judge Win-
deyer and Salomons, Q.C., had made it up and
were now great friends, Salomons thus spoke in
N.S.W. Council last week :
Everyone knows that, in my judgment, I received a
great wrong and a great injustice from Mr. Justice Win-
deyer some eight or nine years ago. In the language of
Mr. Crick and Mr. Meagher, his action forced me, in the
interests of the colony to which I was so indebted, and
having regard to the administration of justice, which was
more important than my private wishes, to set aside and
forego the object which, as regards professional success, I
had had before my eyes for years. Let no one he oblivious
of this : that I was appointed Chief-Justice, and had the
Queen’s Patent. (Cheers.) But I took the view, although
I admit with great sorrow, perhaps as a punishment to
me, that I must deny myself the sitting in the chief seat
of justice because, did I sit there, there would be
scenes in the Court that would destroy the confidence of
the people in the administration of justice. Then
afterwards, in a moment of passion, that same
judge not very long ago dealt out to me a measure
of language in the Court which wounded me more
deeply than any words of mine can convey. But
I do not care to have a life-long feud with any man. 1
am too conscious of the uncertainty of human life and my
own failings, and my hope of winning pardon for my own
sins, to deny to him the forgiveness I hope to receive for
my own weaknesses. I became reconciled. I admit that
before that matter we had been long and deep friends;
but never since that day have I eaten or drunk a drop in
the house of Mr. Justice Windeyer, although we are on
friendly and amicable terms, as is necessary for the ad-
ministration of justice, seeing my position in the Court
and his position on the Bench.
Here everybody recalled the words of Shylock
I will talk with you, walk with you,
But I will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray
with you.

A DESPICABLE NUISANCE.
(to the editor op The Bulletin.)
Sir, —I am a regular subscriber to your paper,
and read it attentively, and consider that I have
a perfect right to protest against the impudence
of advertisers, who, starting with a matter of
public interest, spring upon the unsuspecting
reader a recommendation of their wares. Why
should the übiquitous advertisement be intruded
upon the privacy of my reading by jugglery only
worthy of a thimble-rigging mountebank ? Are
readers to be for ever harassed by these pachyder-
matous purloiners of our time and attention ? The
limit to my endurance was reached last night.
Whilst following up the Premier’s remarks to the
electors I was faced with the statement that
Frossard’s Cavour Cigars are mild and fragrant.
Who shall deliver us? Everyone already knows
this ; also, that the nicotine is extracted in vacuo,
and that they are obtainable everywhere, I have
smoked no other for years.—l am, &c..

Melbourne demise :
Hearty, crab-apple har-
bor - master Fuliarton,
with the phiz of Victor
Hugo. His life-long am-
bition was to whip the
quid out of his jaw with
his finger—pop !—hitch
his breeches, shiver his
timbers, spit on his hand,
grasp his cutlass, and go
straight for the Russian
admiral Nockernorf, to
the rescue of Victoria,
“Ha! a female in dis-
tress!” They would do
the regulation fight round
the stage —three upper-
cuts, three lower-cuts,
striking sparks. Instead
of enjoying his leisure,
Fuliarton cobwebbed his
mind with everlasting
ponder over naval man-
oeuvres—and cruel Nock-
emorf never came 1 A
thorn in his flesh was
TurveydropCapt. Payne,
a dignified admiralio
man, who brought out
the alleged warship Nel-
son. Teddy Cohen, as
Customs commissioner,
made Payne harbour-
master, and Fuliarton
could only exercise the
patience of Newman
Noggs ; “ A day will
come.”
The 13 married pressmen on the two
Melb. dailies possess only half-a-dozen children
among the lot. The poor scribe has little time
for such matters. In this respect, journalism
seems a trifle worse—or better—than bicycling.
An utter dislike for exercise and public
show is one of Mark Twain’s peculiarities. If he
can possibly help it he won’t move out of his hotel.
This is a boon to the “ Much-Travelled,” for M.T.
is essentially a “ show ” star. If people could in-
spect Mark’s shaggy mane gratis on the Block
daily a good many would be prepared to take his
evening humor for granted.

the recently-elected Vic. M.L.C., is studying

Miss Cecilia Hobbs, the Stawell (Vic.)
beauty, is daughter of the three-fourths owneress
of the Magdala-Moonlight mine, from which Mrs.
Hobbs has been drawing, say, £3OOO a month for
several years past, on an initial outlay of £lOOO.
Kimnaker Kinsman, the boss Melbourne
marrying-parson, advertises a reminder-of his own
golden wedding, with “Thank God!” Beautiful
bell-wether ! Four thousand happy couples on
the one historical little sofa, and yet there is
stuffing left.
The full name of the new Governor of
Queensland is Charles Wallace Alexander Napier
Cochrane Baillie, Baron Lamington. His initials
have already been packed and despatched to
Brisbane per cargo steamer, and the nobleman
himself follows at an early date.
E. B. L. Dickens, ex-M.P. (N.S.W.), son
of novelist Dickens, isnow, itis alleged, anappraiser
under the N.S.W. Land Act, and an appointee
of the Reid Government. This appointment was
probably made for the same reason that E.B.L.
was elected to Parliament —viz., because “he took
the trouble to be born.”
A recently-made Vic. knight was in atten-
dance at a certain rural function recently, when
he was approached by one of a knot of bucolic
admirers, with, “Good afternoon to you. Mister
Blank!” “Hush!” exclaimed a consternated
onlooker. “You mustn’t call him mister—he’s a
knight, man.” “Oh, he is, is he !” was the dis-
gusted reply. “ Then / don’t shake hands with
’im.”
“Shot a man wanst” is a Melbourneism,
which appears in type again over the Akehurst
business, and is not exactly understandable by
outsiders. O’Hea was a M.P., one of Syme’s
hacks. He travelled to Colac with two strangers
who were discussing politics. O’H. interposed
with “ Sorr, I shot a man wanst for saying less
than you are saying now.” He never heard the
last of it.
The late J. M. Toohey was a South Mel-
bournite by birth and always had some sort of in-
terest in that busted suburb. When Mat. Lar-
kin’s building society “shortages” were first dis-
covered, and thought to be a mere trifle of £lO,OOO
or so, Toohey came over from Sydney, it was
said with a view to pulling Matthias through.
But he found that a rescue of “ honest Matt.”
was out of the question.
George Coppin, after bemoaning the fate
of his bank-shares and other investments, said to
a Melb. newspaper reporter : “It is a sad ending
to an eventful life, is it not?” But the end of a
successful man’s life isn’t solely a matter of L.S.D.
On Coppin’s theory the careers of some of the
world’s brightest men were sad from start to finish,
inasmuch as the poor devils never had any capital
worth mentioning.
Frequent paragraphs in Melb. Herald of
late commence thus
The many friends of Mr. J. F. Hogan, M.P., in Mel-
bourne, Geelong and Victoria generally will he very

To understand the frequency with which the
public are told that they will be pleased to hear
about Hogan, it is necessary to know that he is

A STRONG LIKENESS.
VISITOR: “Do you think he resembles his pa?”
MOTHER: “ Oh, yes; he keeps me up late every night?”
unanimously suspected of being the said London
correspondent.
The Saturday Review, noticing a slovenly
compilation by that ridiculous person, Albert
Calvert (most shameless and pretentious of shoddy
self-advertisers), on “The Exploration of Aus-
tralia,” objects that he has omitted all mention of
the work in this direction of Burke and Wills,
“ who are so famous iu the history of Australia as
to have given their names to streets.” The
Saturday reviewer evidently thinks that Bourke-
street, Melb., is called after explorer Burke, in-
stead of after Gov. Bourke.
A London paper speaks of Lady Hope-
tonn’s “ Rubenesque style of beauty.” When in
Melbourne Lady Hopetoun was tall and slim, and
her features were refined, and her face oval ;
whereas Rubens invariably painted big, fat,
coarse Dutch wenches, with Christmas-pudding
faces, and busts like mountains. Even in his
famous “Rape of Sabine Women” he made the
ladies like washerwomen for coarse bulkiness. Is
Lady Hopetoun “ fillin’ out? ” \
Mark Twain is not much of a humorist to
his wife and daughter. One who spent an evening
with the trio in Melbourne says : “I was very
much amused by the conversation of the Tramp
Abroad. His quaint turns of expression and his
sparks of wit kept me in a continual titter of mer-
riment. But I noticed that the Mark-ess and
Miss Mark took no live interest in papa’s talk.
Madame lolled in her chair and put on a far-away
look, whilst Miss read ‘ Love in Idleness ’ —a
shilling’s-worth of fiction in blue covers. Perhaps

“The Victorian railways will never be made to pay until they are placed
in the hands of a syndicate. "— Representative Vic. Fat Man at Castlemaine
banquet.
MOSES MAC SHYNDIKIT: “ You gif me hold of dot string, mein leetle
jriendt, und I will show you how to make dose railvays pay.”
YOUNG VIC.: “ Not much, Moses. I'll pull the string, you do the rest.”
it is rather trying to spend a lifetime with a pro-
fessional humorist, who is expected to be funny all
the time.”
When Mark Hambourg was executing one
of his most thrilling pieces at Melb. Town Hall,
the head of probably the biggest firm of Australian
stenographers watched him throughout with a rapt
expression, his hands grasping the seat in front of
him, and his eyes starting from his face. As
Mark struck the final chord of about 24 notes the
man of transcription leaned back and took a long
breath. “Great Scott,” he said, “ what a type-
writer he’d make ! ”
In a lecture last week on “Prominent
Australians” Angus Cameron, M.P. (N.S.W.),
said that “ Like many others, ‘Old Jack ’ Robert-
son left public life poorer than he found it, and
the <£lo,ooo voted by Parliament to him upon his
retirement was spent in paying his debts—a
matter that was not generally known, but one
with which people ought to he acquainted.” Mr.
Cameron might have emphasised his point by
stating that some of the politicians who helped
the vote through Parliament were themselves
large creditors of “old Jack.”
One good point about ex-Premier Dibbs is
that, since his rejection at Tamworth, he has
never been known to wail about his defeat, or to
say that he didn’t want “ hoffis,” or to complain
about the ingratitude of his country, or to lament
in any shape or form about his downfall. He
hasn’t even remarked, as Shiels did, that he would
take his defeat in a cheerful spirit; he has simply
taken it, and said nothing about it. And he
hasn’t once remarked to a reporter that he was
glad to he out of politics. All he did after his
fall was to go home and hitch the horse to Ins
famous personally-invented water-raising machine,
and when the horse proved unequal to the job
instead of lamenting about the failure he bar-
nessed the family cow along with it, and when the
horse and cow together proved that the machine
was no good the old man took the collapse of his
invention in a cordial spirit and sent to Sydney
for an oil engine. Nobody ever met adversity in
a happier frame of mind than old, blundering,
D imchicae-o Dihhs
Reay, editor of Melb. Herald, IS a whole
heap of things. In addition to being a journalist
of abnormal activity, with an insatiable appetite
for work, he is captain of a co. of mounted rifles,
also secretary and treasurer to same; he is like-
wise a temperance-lecturer, a mason, a female
franchise - leaguer, an oddfellow, an Australian
native, a federation-leaguer, a social democrat, a
Yarra-bank orator, an anti-sweater, a protec-
t.omst, a capital-punishment abolitionist, a cur-
rency crank ; is treasurer of the Institute of Jour-
nalists, vice-president of the Victorian Shorthand
Writers Association, and a candidate for Parha-
merit, with the ambition to become Minister of
Defence, and reform that rqttenest of Vic. Govt.
departments. Though he is constantly taking
part in some public movement, delivering lectures,
and reading papers, he never puts Ins own name
in his paper, and seldom allows anybody else to
do it. He began as a sailor, turned schoolmaster,
had a turn at sugar-refining, bought two news-
papers, 200 miles apart, and ran both of them,
being his own editor, printer, and publisher. He
is first into the Hkrai.D office in the morning and
is last to leave at night. Some say he never
sleeps. He is 36 years old.
N.S.W. Works Minister Garrard describe*
the Reid Govt, as “ a God-fearing Ministry.*
This in allusion to the prayer-for-rain fake, and
the day of national thanksgiving, and other trans-
parent devices to catch the “ pious” vote. Bub il
Jacob Garrard is wise he will cease canting in
public. Every Government, however holy, has a
woman or two in its cupboard, and when those
women come out nobody talks about their God-
fearing proprietors.
Zimmerman, the world’s champion cyclist,
is a six-footer, and impresses one as being more a
lightning sprinter than a cycling scorcher. Ha
has a very youthful appearance, ant), like the
famous Tom Busst in his palmy wheeling days,
has ideal “cycling legs,” all bone and sinew.
“ Zim.” says he doesn’t particularly want to race,
but will do so at any meeting on receipt of .£lOO
to start. His chief game is to boom the “Nim-
rod ’’ cycles, holding as he does a large interest in
the firm.
George God-
frey, the newest

one of the rew
men in Australia
who have com-
mitted thedisloyal
act of serving an
Imperial Gover-
nor with a writ —
which he did as an
articled clerk at
the time of the
Darling trouble,
on behalf of the
Melb. law-firm of
Attenborough and
Wilks. He de-
manded to see Sir
Charles in person,
and, on his ap-
pearing, delivered
the writ with a
bow. Darling
gasped for breath
at the sacrilege,
and waited lOsec.
for an avenging
thunderbolt to
strike the semi-
Semitic youth
dead. As Heaven
appeared dilatory,
Darling concluded
to take the job
into his own
hands, and grab-
bing Godfrey by
the scruff,ran him
out of the front
door, and slung
him with em-
phasis on the
travel-path. How
much would many
an M.L.C. give to
be able to boast of
being “chucked
out” by a real live Governor ?
Another painful proof of Our Gracious
Queen’s literary incapacity has come to light. It
i s a letter written with her own royal hand to
Dhuleep Singh, when that dusky personage was
suspected of disaffection to the Hempire. Thus
er Majesty expressed her personal alarm an
Cannot* tfele ttd? Always expressed such
j oya ity and devotion towards me, your truest friend, and
w),o, 1 may say, took a maternal interest in you from the
time when, now 32 years ago, you came to England as a
beautiful, a charming boy. Let me appeal to all that is
noble in you, and abandon wild ideas and plans, which
can only plunge you into deeper difficulties, etc.
T ke fiction of V.R.’s commanding intellect and
intense culchaw is ruthlessly destroyed every time
her bona-fide brain-work is held np to criticism,
bu t this happens at long intervals only, and the
newspapers are always eager to reconstruct the
shattered lie. Of course, it wasn’t Dhuleep Singh
w ho took a maternal interest in himself, nor did
Q uee n Victoria seek Dhuleep’s permission to
abandon wild ideas and plans. These are simply
wrong impressions conveyed by her mis-shapen
letter. Therefore The Bulletin, in a true spirit
of loyalty, now appeals to the Sovereign Lady to
abandon wild ideas of grammar, and refrain from
putt.ng Queen a H.nglish to confusion.

W. BALCHIN, Agent, SYDNEY,
Is no Home Exempt?
ATTACK ON A TAMWORTH LADY.
HOW IT OCCURRED —HER DESCRIPTION OF THE CIR-
CUMSTANCES, AND THE OVERWHELMING TES-
TIMONY OF PROMINENT WITNESSES.
Mrs. Matheson’s statement of this ferociom
attack is so extiaordinary that some readers might
think it incredible, or that she was deceived by
appearances, but her lamentable condition was
admitted by her local doctor, and corroborated by
the physician in charge at the Electric Baths in
Sydney, and her sufferings were witnessed by all
of her immediate friends and neighbours. Con-
sequently it is not to be wondered at that our in-
terviewer left her thoroughly convinced of the
truth of her statements, which should be placed
before the public. In fact, what she suffered and
endured —her narrow escape from death—is the
talk of the town, and her home has been besieged
by friends offering congratulations. Her own
statement, made July 16th, 1894 : “ It is now five
years since I had occasion to use any kind of
medicine, having been cured at that time of a
very long and severe illness by taking Warner’s
Safe Remedies. The complaint I suffered from
was muscular rheumatism ; my neck, arms, legs,
and back were much swollen and stiff. I could
not turn my head or lift my arms, neither could I
move myself into a sitting posture. The kidneys
were also in a very bad state, the pains in the
back most excruciating, appetite feeble, and my
condition altogether helpless. My friends did not
expect that 1 could possibly live. I had spent
many pounds in advice and prescriptions, all to
no benefit, and also underwent a month’s treat-
ment at the E'ectrio Baths in Sydney, but re-
turned worse than ever, and without any hope of
getting about again. At this juncture a medical
pamphlet containing the account of a remarkable
cure by Warner’s Safe Remedies in the case of a
gentleman whose symptoms were similar to my
own was given me. I resolved at once to com-
mence with a course of Safe Cure and Safe Rheu-
matic Cure alternately, and was delighted to find
some relief from the first two bottles. Persever-
ing until I had taken seven bottles, and one bottle
of Safe Pills, I became free from all aches and
pains, and able to eat and sleep well and help my-
self without any assistance whatever. To this
day I have had no return of the complaint.
Many friends and neighbours are ready to vouch
for tiie truth of this statement, for they say they
never expected me to be about among them again,
and were greatly surprised that any medicine
could do what the Safe Remedies have done for
me. I have lived in the colonies forty-five years,
and raised a family of nineteen children, and am
well known throughout the district of Tamwqrth,
where my unexpected recovery has caused quite a
sensation. .

POLITICAL POINTS
.
Journalist; “After long observation ot
the Vic. Parliamentary refreshment-room, I con-
tend it ought to he abolished, and that a neighbor-
ing caterer would, spring up, in the natural order
of things.”
Of the total purchase-money received by
Q. Govt, for land sold since Separation, about
6£ millions, not £1 has gone for railway con-
struction or redemption of public debt. Consoli-
dated Revenue has swallowed up the whole—for
payment of interest.
Since the Townsville-Hughenden line was
built it has earned a net profit over all charges of
more than A 270 000. Now that the Winton exten-
sion is to be added (estimated to cost only a little
over .£2OOO per mile for the first 45 miles) it will
be still more lucrative.
.. „ r . v i i. i a „„
The Q. railway figures for the last 14 years
£lB9 705; Southern and Western system owes
the country £2 153 861. No wonder the Queen-
street politician objects to Separation.
r

The late JOHN ROPER, the last survivor but
one of Leichhardt's. expedition.
Q. Government omits nothing to secure
election-success. It alternately threatens, whee-
dles, bribes. The latest move is to dangle before
Parliament railways from Charieville to Cunna-
mulla, 121 miles ; Hughenden to Winton, 65 miles;
South and North Rockhampton, 2| miles ; branch
to Broadmount, 15£ miles.
Melb. people have again asserted them-
selves democratically at an anti-sweating meet-
ing by refusing to accept a motion of thanks to the
Mayor and City Council for the use of the Town
Hall. The Mayor and Council are not entitled to
any thanks for allowing the people to use that
which belongs to the people.
Among the exhibits confidentially sub-
mitted by Lormer to the Melb. Crown Law
authorities in substantiation of his denunciation
of the honorarium magistracy were some strange
Chinese documents, purporting to be receipts for
cash paid for squaring beaks in lottery-cases. The
valiant Lormer evidently means business.
Opposition-leader John Downer (S.A.), on
different occasions and with much frequency,
brings two charges against the Kingston Govt.
(1) That its policy is unstatesmanlike and alto-
gether inadequate to the needs of the country, and
(2) That its policy in all essential particulars
was stolen from his Govt., which was defeated in
June, 1893.
Wood, M.P. (S.A.), moved in the Assem-
bly, during the discussion of the Public Salaries
Reduction Bill, that no M.P. while holding his
seat should be allowed to engage in any other
trade, calling, or profession. “My political duties
take up all my time,” he said, “ and we don’t
allow other public servants to earn money by
private work.”
A Sydney speculator proposes to run a
railway from Queensland to the Westralian coast,
to carry trains running 150 miles an hour, with a
canal alongside to take heavy merchandise. Grape-
vines are to be trellised along the line, which is to
be further rendered valuable by the provision of
telegraph and telephone communication. All now
wanted is money.
In N.S. Wales, 97| P er cent, of the tobacco-
growers are Chinese, 90 per cent, of scrub-cutters,
75 per cent, of market-gardeners, 74 per cent, of
vegetable hawkers, 57 per cent, of tin-miners, 50
per cent, of ring barkers, 47 per cent, of green-
grocers, 48 per cent, of hotel cooks, &c., &c.
When the Chow once lays hold of an industry,
you can bet that he is going to monopolise
that industry, if there are enough of him in the
country to do it.
N.S.W. Government, if it is wise or in
earnest about Constitutional reform, will pass
a complete Referendum Bill through the Assem-
bly. before it sends to the Council a second
Reform Bill, containing referendum clauses for
which there is no political machinery. Try the
Councillors with pure jam before giving them
jam with rhubarb in it.
According to Vic. Opposition, Premier
Turner is at present wandering around the House
holding in his hand an empty skull (his own), and
begging that somebody will, for the love of God,
drop an idea into it. A pretty robust metaphor.
He doesn’t trouble Patterson’s side of the House,
however. To go there in search of ideas would be
like going to a goat’s house to look for wool.
“ Dick ” Sleath, M.P., was stonewalling
the Goulburn-Crookwell Railway Bill in N.S.W.
Assembly, and picturing the affected district as a
howling waste. A voice : “ Were you ever there?”
Sleath : “ I resided in that district for a consider-
able time.” Samson Haynes; “Your oppor-
tunities for observation were very limited.” Then
the House remembered that Sleath had resided in
Goulburn gaol!
According to Premier Nelson, no one can
hire a subject of Japan to come to Queensland
without depositing a substantial sum with the
Jap. Govt. Nelson knows perfectly well that
Australia fears the free Japanese immigrant more
than the coolie laborer. According to the same
authority, the Japanese women on Thursday
Island have been smuggled thither disguised as
men. The Jap. Govt., when informed of the
incident, took immediate steps to prevent a recur-
rence.
Thus Brisbane Courier : “We are trying to
prove that Europeans can live and thrive in field-
work upon which the flood of tropical heat is
poured down during a tropical summer, and re-
markable success has been achieved. Along the
coast-lands of Queensland white farmers are
founding homes, and Queensland has the only
white agricultural settlement in tropical Aus-
tralia.” And only five years ago the white man
couldn’t work there at all—according to the same
authority.
N.S. W. Education Minister Garrard grows
enthusiastic over the W.C.T.U. idea of instruct-
ing public-school children in the evils of drink by
means of elementary text-books. But care must
be taken to make the lessons physiologically cor-
rect. Out of the 50 States of the American Union
44 have passed measures making such instruction
obligatory, but in many cases it has been found
that the information imparted consisted merely of
the yells, whoops, and upside-down statistics of
wild-eyed women.
Grifiihvraith’s prophecy that the re-intro-
dnotion of Kanakas into Leperland would give
new life to the sugar-industry and provide mar-
kets for maize and horses at big prices, has proved
a will-o’-the-wisp. Maize and horses have never
been lower in prices ; nor, indeed, has sugar itself.
In the biggest Q. mill and refinery—Millaquin,
Bundaberg—there has recently been a fid. cut in
the 6s. a day wages, with the bosses reduced Is. a
day, and one scientific employe 2s. fid. a day. It
is becoming clearer every day that the Kanaka is
not white industry’s feeder, but its blood-sucker.
At Camooweal the
Chinese are invading
Queensland from the
Northern Territory.
Several have been ar-
rested for crossing the
border, and, having
no property, have
been, of course, dis-
charged. The astute
John foresees this, and
either sends on his
money ahead or leaves
it witli Chinese cooks
on the stations to be
sent after him. A few
weeks’ arrest and
cheap tucker are no
great hardship.
If the N.S. Wales
Local Government Bill
were passed it is
reckoned that the new
municipalities would
raise from <£500,000 to
<£750,000 a year in
rates, and save that
amount to the public
Treasury. As there
are no signs of it pass-
ing, the existing muni-
cipalities are kicking
furiously against the
land-tax. They com-
plain that, under the
new order of things,
they will have to pay
the biggest share of
the tax, to pay their
own local expenditure
as heretofore, and to
pay, through their
share of the general
taxation, at least half
the local expenditure
of the unincorporated
districts. This ar-
rangement isobviously
contrary to abstract
justice; the only good
feature about it is that
the heavy end of the
taxation will fall on the
big towns, and there is
a great deal too much
big town in N.S.W.
for the circumstances
of that province.
Speaking of the “ move on ” street-regula-
tion, Sydney D.T. scornfully refers to “loungers,
whose place is in the parks, if it is anywhere.”
That is true Tory contempt for the unemployed :
his place is nowhere. Yet the labor-hind borrows
his politics from, and votes at the bidding of, the
D.T. ; and Labor M’sP. turn public somersaults
in order to grovel for its favors. Yes; their place
is nowhere, “if it is anywhere.”
Once more the S.M. Herald girds at
Maorilaud and Victoria for not establishing a
policy of reciprocity with the Fieetrade Govt, of
N.S. Wales. What is there to be reciprocated?
Premier Reid is, or says he is, going to make
Sydney and other N.S. W. ports absolutely free
ports—not to Victoria, nor to Maorilaud, nor to
reciprocating countries only, but to all the world.
This is to be done for Premier Reid’s own pur-
poses. Then how can he talk “ reciprocity ” and
“free ports to all-comers” in one and the same
breath? He is going to saw off the reciprocity
bough on which he is sitting—if he means what
he says.
According to Coghlan, in New South Wales
rather more than per cent, of the agricultural
and pastoral freehold land is occupied by people
who pay rent to the owners ; in South Australia,
in 1891, the last year for which statistics were
available, 66 per cent, is rented land ; in Maori-
land 36 per cent. No returns are supplied by the
other provinces, but evidently Australia is getting
on well towards the formation of a squirearchy on
the fine old Hinglish plan, accompanied by fire-
works and rejoicings and old ale among the
loyal tenantry when the heir comes of age,
and diversified by rheumatism caused by lying
behind a damp hedge at night with a gun looking
for the agent.
Premier Reid's attitude is practically this :
“ Unless you pass my Loan Bill I won’t help the
unemployed.’’ Consequently, the Loan Bill
passes, because whoever opposes it is set down as
a heartless ruffian with no sympathy for the poor.
Some day another Premier may say: “Unless
you let me build land-grant railways, or unless
you let me sell the State railways to my shindy-
kit, I won’t find any work for the unemployed,”
which will be equally logical. The present N.S. W.
Govt, won’t find work for the unemployed unless
the country first allows it to cook the public
accounts and produce a sham surplus by charging
current expenses to loan moneys. The alleged
friend of the poor looks tolerably mean under
these conditions.
r X
A STAGE MARRIAGE.
JOHNNIR: “ Is that charming Miss De Tartington MARRIED?"
BUSKIS (of the [?]healre Royal): “Can’t say; not to her present
husband, in any case.”
According to Mr. Nakagawa, Japanese
consul in Hongkong, the Japs are failures as
colonists. Accustomed to a simple life at home,
they are unprepared and unfitted for the fierce
competition they must encounter: abroad. In
Hawaii alone have they been successful, while in
Fiji and New Caledonia they have proved
disastrous failures; also (Mr. Nakagawa asserts)
in Queensland.
In this issue of The Bulletin appears the
portrait of good - looking Alex. Montgomery,
whose stories and sketches, printed in this paper
during the past three years, have made his signa-
ture grateful to the eyes of every appreciative
reader. Mr. Montgomery is Scottish, owns to
nearly 50 years of age, and looks about two-thirda
of them. The Bulletin regards his work,
particularly his Bornean stories, as some of
the most vigorous and valuable yarn-stuff that
has ever appeared in its columns. Mr. Mont-
gomery’s literary style is a model strong,
clear, brilliant, and picturesque—lacking only
a little more sympathy and variety to be
perfect. His matter is rare and original,
abounding in interest, and salted with sardonic
humor. When a volume of Mr. Montgomery’*
collected stories appears, which will probably be
soon, The Bulletin predicts for it a warm wel-
come and an instant success.
John Roper, who died at Merriwa, N.S.
Wales, on Sept. 15 last, was one of Australia’s
historic explorers. Born in Gayton-Thorpe,
county Norfolk, Eng., in 1824, he reached this
country in ’43. He was thus only 20 years old
when he embarked his small savings in the famous
expedition which Leichhardt led from Moreton
Bav to Port Essington in ’44. Besides Leichhardt
and Roper, the adventurous party originally in-
cluded James Calvert (no relation of the absurd
Cockney tourist who is now puffing himself in
England as an “explorer”), John Murphy, Pember-
ton Hodgson, naturalist Gilbert, Win. Phillips(con-
vict), an American negro named Caleb, and two
aboriginals, Charley and Harry. Hodgson and
Caleb returned to Brisbane before going far. The
others continued their journey and reached Port
Essington, on the Northern coast, on Dec. 17, 1845,
a year and four months after starting. Thence they
returned in the schooner Heroine to Sydney,
which was reached March 29, 1846, after all hope
of them had been given up. Roper proved him-
self a most intrepid and valuable member of the
party. On 25th June, 1845, during an attack by
blacks near the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria,
Gilbert was killed and Roper and Calvert were
severely wounded. On 13th Oct., ’45, Roper dis-
covered the river which bears his name. The
party was in extremity for want of water, and
Roper rode on a little distance, ascended a
low hill, and saw stretched before him a
magnificent country through which a fine river
slowly meandered to the Gulf. When the party
reached Sydney, a private and public subscription
was raised, totalling .£1000; of which Leichhardt
received .£6OO and Roper and Calvert <£l2s each.
The next 20 years of Roper’s life were spent chiefly
in pastoral pursuits, and in ’6B he was appointed
a Govt, inspector of stock at Merriwa —an office
which he held until his retirement on a small
pension, two years ago. Roper made a genial,
hearty, vigorous old man, performed his duties
admirably, and gained the goodwill of everybody
he had to do with. His death, at 71, robs Aus-
tralia of one of the few survivors of the grand old
pioneering band.
A MISSION-HYMN.
“ We are doing- a glorious work in India and China."—
{Sermon recently given in Brisbane on the Chinese
massacres.)
“ Grog-shops exist and flourish in nearly all the large
towns of India." — (Report of Wesleyan Missionary Con-
ference.)
Behold on burning India’s coral strand
The swart Hindoo arise, baptised and bland ;
Behold him change, for fashions fair and new,
His reptile gods and crocodilean crew !
Forsaking Ganges’ grateful holy stream
He seeks the fount where Bass’s glories gleam,
Deserts the Sacred Ox he loved of old
And bows before our Sacred Calf of Gold.
From Juggernaut he flies to Jug-or-Naught,
And flouts the faith inane his father taught;
Lo! Buddh and Brahm he scouts with scornful
jeer,
And cries, “O Bible great and greater Beer 1 ”
Long, long, O Brahmin-ridden Bengalee,
May scoffers mark thee crook a Christian knee
While pious Bull, exulting, tells the tale :
“ He reads our Scriptures and he drinks our ale! ’>

With an ordinary tape measure determine th“ width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel GO,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally lake,
what are your peculiarities- a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All ibe.se
little matters attended to. If you have a long thbi fo 'i o ( .
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to Khhl.'s
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
country districts where practical booi making is unknown,
has decided to supply his patrons at the lowest cash price.

“The boots fit splendidly and are very cheap. You
should extend your business to N.Z., where no such system
is in vogue. I shall do what I can to recommend you.”
GEO. PAMMENT, Seddon-st., Kumara, N.Z. May 7, 1895.
“The boots you made me from description of my foot
and self-measurements have more than satisfied me I
never had a pair of such well-fitting and comfoi table
boots—so much so, that I have discarded all my old
enemies. Your price, with duty and everything, does
not come up to the price charged here for boots not to
be compared with yours.”—JOHN M'ARTHUR, Police
Magistrate, Longreach, Queensland. May 31,1895.
“ I am sending you an order for two more pairs of your
boots. Those you sent me were a splendid fit, and for
workmanship and durability they’ could not be surpassed.
1 have had them in wear now 12 months, and there is not
a crack in them, and 1 have no more trouble with my in-
growing nails or corns.” —SAML. RUTTER, Moorara

Razor a trial. This brand of razor is something superior to any others offered to the public.
It is specially-tempered, perfectly hollow ground, rings like a bell and never requires grinding. We
can highly recommend it to the general public. Being practical tradesmen ourselves, we
know the exact kind of edge that is required to ensure an easy shave, and, having had them in use for
a number of years, can testify to their merits. We guarantee each Razor for Two Years.

. _ Anarchists in Australia,” writes “One
of lliem 9 to The Bulletin, “make it a practice
to stop and kick into the gutter any fruit-skins,
etc., that they may see lying on the footpaths,
inis solicitude is not clue to any habit of carrying
ombs m their pockets, but because they consider
‘at if anyone slipped on a peel that they had
noticed and had neglected to remove, they would
e morally responsible for his sufferings. A good
, , I . rlo , re Anarchists in the streets would be a
public benefit.”
Dear Bulletin, — lie the Nunneley analytic
blunder (your par. of 28 Sept.)-a man in Eng-
land was once actually under sentence of death,
before laylor, the noted toxicologist, discovered
that the arsenic which he had previously testified
to finding in the fluids of the supposed murdered
person, had been accidentally introduced by him-
self during the process of analysis. Isn’t it mere
than likely—-since the tube-test for arsenic will
show the presence of the 500,000 th of a grain
that an unsuspected trace of the drug in some of
the re-agents employed has in this way sent many
a man to the gallows ? Speculum.

Sydney’s militant cleric, Bev. Jas. Clarke,
who was, rightly or wrongly, arrested and fined
tor drunkenness, the other day, has had his
license to preach cancelled by the Primate. The
police department hates Clarke like poison ever
since he got atheist Walker out of its clutches;
the Supreme Court bench wishes him at Tirnbuo-
too; and 0. of E. ecclesiastics moan in agony
over the Man Who Won’t Keep Quiet. Clarke
says that the Primate’s inhibition is illegal, and
declines to surrender his church, and the Primate
hesitates to turn him out by force for fear of the
scandal. The Rev. Jas. has now three appeals
under weigh—-one to Queen Vic., against Judge
Wmdeyer’s divorce law ; one against his convic-
tion for drunkenness; and one against his Primate.
Altogether, a very pretty pickle. And there is a
good deal ofi y -npathy with Clarke among those
who know the facts.

It is reckoned that in tlie recent severe
weather 40,000 to 60,000 newly - shorn sheep
perished one night in the Millie (N.S.W.) district.
In one case, out of 1080 sheep shorn 1000 perished
durin? the ensuing night. Another station lost
fully 4000.
A record In fecundity. A mare belonging
to W. R. Yirgoe, of Mathonra Station (N.S.W.)
was covered by a half-bred Welsh pony on 3rd
and 12th Sept, only, and was afterwards kept in a
paddock with mares only, the only stallions within
15 miles round being always kept in stables
securely. On 12th Aug. following she dropped a
filly foal ; eight weeks later —viz., on Gth Oct.—
she dropped a colt foal, and 17 days later on yet a
third foal (colt). She suckled all three, and was
a splendid mother, not allowing the other mares
near her triple brood.

DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENTS
Mr. Steel is undertaking his DISCRETIONARY IN-
VESTMENTS as usual on the abovenaraed meeting, and as
Mr. Steel is EXTRA confident of success over the WHOLE
of the approaching “Spring Campaign” THIS year. Mr.
Steel’s PAST experiences go to PROVE that the above
CAULFIELD CUP meeting (and the MELBOURNE CUP
meeting a fortnight later) are THE BEST of the WHOLE
year for BACKERS OF HORSES, the “RING” being a
more REPRESENTATIVE one at this season than any
other, and consequently MORE MONEY TO BE WON ;
therefore, he considers the opportunity THE MOST
FAVORABLE ONE for GIVING HIM A TRIAL. Should
you not have time to POST your money, you can WIRE it 1
These DISCRETIONARV INVESTMENTS are under-
taken EVERY SATURDAY over the CURRENT
Races ROUND MELBOURNE, for clients who cannot
themselves attend, by Mr. A. W. STEEL (member of
Tattersall’s), who frequently makes his clients GOOD
WINNERS, and has the pleasure of sending them
WINNING CHEQUES.
These DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENTS,
conducted by Mr. Steel, must perforce be better than
going into SWEEPS, etc., where the odds are 1000 to 1
against you, whereas HERB the odds are all IN YOUR
FAVOR I

MENTS.

IMPORTANT CAUTION.
tST" Please to observe that Mr. Steel is the only AC-
CREDITED PUBLIC INVESTOR in Melbourne, so
BEWARE of people who might WRITE you (not

take DISCRETIONARY IN VESTMENTS, or express-
ing their desire to BACK CERTAIN HORSES for you.
ANY persons from here who WRITE you, or send
you price-lists, circulars, e(o., making such offers, you
may put down as “Impostors,” if their advertisements do
not appear in THIS and OTHER respectable journals.
SPECIAL WARNING!—TIuse “parasites” are
AGAIN “in the field” JUST NOW, sending circulars to
the unwary, advising them to back certain horses
THROUGH THEM for ihe CAULFIELD CUP, etc., and,
of course, offering SEVERAL POINTS above the LEGITI-
MATE odds!
Mr. Steel begs to THANK those of his clients who have
made him aware cf these facts, and senthim the “Bogus”
Vouchers which these individuals endeavoured to FORCE

SPORTING NOTIONS.
ihere being only one Austral wheel-race a year
with its first prize of £2OO, and second of £4O, makes
every competitor a trier. Therefore, the bookmakers will
lay the odds at an average price of 16 to 1. On Melb.
cricket-ground, scene of the Austral, the bookie dare nob
bellow prices—but he can take them. Much Austral
betting goes on in Melb. streets—as much as £5OO having
been laid by an Israelite against one man in one day.
Shop-betting having been suppressed, business is now
carried on in the streets. Several men will be jigging
for over £lOOO in next Austral, and two or three for £l5OO.
• * * •
Adelaide is said to have a cycling Carbine in
the untried, 21 year-old W. A. J. Busst. He comes of the
best Australian cycle-racing family, stands sft. 10in., and
scales list. He is trained by his brother Tom, and is
Credited with some remarkable private performances.
The story goes that “he is equal to Tom at Tom’s best.”
Which means that, with 150yds. handicap, the Austral
£2OO is his.
♦ * * »
Meadham, Payne and Weaver, the Sydney
cyclists, should cut all they know for the two £lOO
Sydney prizes. Waiting for the Austral probably means
not waiting for £lOOO, nor even for one another, but for
Busst, Clinton or Matthews.
• « « «
Zim. has brought a triplet with him to do
exhibition miles, time trials, and work up generally the
glare and whoop. But only the Adelaide Oval asphalt
track, Adelaide Exhibition track, and St. Kilda
(Melb.) track, with their three laps to the mile, are suffi-
ciently dished to permit triplet pacing. On Melb. cricket-
ground, scene of the Austral, and Sydney cricket-ground,
scene of the big Sydney meeting, the flat grass tracks,
with their four laps to the mile, won’t allow a tandem
to gs its fastest. And these two are the only Melbourne
and Sydney places where Zim. can satisfactorily hip-
podrome.
• • • «
“Zim.’s” father is a New Jersey millionaire,
so that the Australian public will be able to see a cyclist
who doesn’t need to “ run stiff” in the interests of Ikey
Mo’s "bag.” Which will be a novelty after the football
season.
* * ♦ *
Neil Matterson, ex-sculler, started cycling too
late in life to set the track on fire. Athletes of his type
and age are good stayers—too good, in fact, for they are
never able to cultivate a sprint, and must, therefore, be
beaten on the post by younger and more brilliant men.
The sprint is the thing in cycling.
« « * •
Those two ,£lOO prizes at N.S.W. League of
Wheelmen’s Nov. meeting will bring out the true form of
Graeme, Wooten, Gowens, Bennett, and S. Matterson.
“Joe ” Scott is the only Melbourneite that might totally
upset the N.S.W. group, unless Morton came with
another surprise. His fourth in the 25 miles Vic. road-
race three months ago was a big performance for a
reputed non-stayer and novice.
It was Morton who paced Oathie last time, only
to be downed on the post by Payne.
» * *
Megson and Co. hope to beat Zim. from scratch.
But supposing Zim. were put on scratch with Megson for
such events as the two £lOO Sydney prizes or Melbourne
Austral’s £2OO, other competitors wouldn’t pay accept-
ance fees. They say, “ Put Zim. at least 150yds. behind
Megson in two miles."
• * • «
The fastest time the Austral (two miles) has been
won in is smin. 1 3-sseo., by Middleton last year off
186yds. mark. O’Brien has practically ridden a mile in
2.24 on Sydney cricket-ground. It would scarcely be
possible to do better than 2.18 for a mile on Melb. or
Sydney cricket-grounds, and Zim. would probably record
his two miles on either in 4.40 or 4.45.
• * ♦ «
Trainer Lee, of Melb,, has in hand Clinton and
Matthews, both as young as Busst, and as promising.
(Lee trained, among others, Bill Beach and Lambton, of
famed Austral memory.) 0. and M., on 270 and 260yds.
respectively, went down in last Austral, and having since
done nil should get good starts,
* « « «
Two of the most prominent Melb. female bikists
are dressmakers who, up to a year ago, were receiving a
pound a week each in a city house. The girls, sisters,
were not slow to see that they made the trade of the
house, so they determined to start on their own account,
doing their work at their clients’ houses. Customers
quickly bid for their services, and the pair, finding tram
locomotion too slow, began to cycle. They now do their
daily rounds on wheels, place their employes in the
houses of their customers, and, at stated intervals, ride
around to see how work progresses. They thus save rent,
and have created for themselves a status above that
enjoyed by the ordinary dressmaker.

According to Zimmerman, the best time for a

Sydney cricket-ground on Eight Hours’ Day
had so large and varied a programme that watching
everything made the spectator as tired as the most active
competitor. The five miles amateur bicycle championship
of Australasia was contested by Reynolds (Auckland, M.L.),
Smith (Brisbane), Gillespie (Vic.), M'Donald, Barratt, and
Cameron (Sydney). The crack of the pistol sent Reynolds
right on to the hind wheel of the tandem, and the first
mile was done in 2.24 J, record time for a mile on the
Sydney track. Gillespie dropped out in the second lap,
Barratt in the third, Cameron in the fourth, and in the
fifth lap Macdonald was a hopeless second, and Smith a
hopeless third. Reynolds kept going well and merrily on
the tandem’s hind wheel, running Macdonald fairly off his
legs, and all but over-lapping him at the finish. Several of
the beaten competitors kept going on and off after first
leaving the track, and yet the committee didn’t heave a
brick at them.
The three-miles running championship saw
Blake (Vic.) and Biggs (N.S.W.) left alone after the sixth
lap (half-way). Then for the next five laps Blake kept
going vigorously, with Biggs stride for stride just behind
him. Just after the bell rang, Biggs tried to pass Blake
on the inside, and Blake, being a footballer, got
the better in this jostling, Half a lap from home the
jostling recommenced, and Biggs getting struck by
Blake’s elbow in the wind, was knocked out of the race,
and Blake won as he liked.

The Glebe (M'Kibbin’s club) made a sensation
in Saturday and Monday’s Sydney cricket by putting up
494 for 8 wickets against Burwood. Youill’s 159 was
made without a chance in five and a half hours. M’Kibbin
scored 63 and Poidevlri 88. South Sydney beat North
Sydney, Dorman (South Sydney) being top scorer each
innings with 47 and 35 ; Syd. Gregory made 17 and 12.
Walters, the ex-Yictorian, 17 and 21, Perkins, ex-Bris-
baneite, made 0 and 7 and took 3 wickets for 21. Turner
got 1 wicket for 66 against University, while Shea, his
fellow bowler, took 7 for 37. M’Kibbin bagged 5 wickets
for 20 against Burwood, and Newell, his partner, 6 for 17.
Walford, wicket-keeping for Waverley against Paddington
(A. Bannerman’s club), stumped three men and caught
one in the second innings.

South Sydney ought to win the local senior
cricket competition. It has nine men who have
played against a Victorian, a N.S.W. or a 6. eleven :
Gregory, Donnan, Callaway, Searle, Hume, Patrick'
Trumble, Walters (ex-Victorian), Perkins (ex-Brisbaneite).

The Bruin-Auraria dream-double has so in-
fatuated some Melbourneites that, unable to “get on”
down South, they sent as far as Townsville and the Towers
for this certainty, some going the length of taking the
100 to 1.

Surprising lack of originality is shown in their

Champion amateur Seale is going to box six
scientific rounds with a certain naval lieutenant. The
lieutenant, who is a stone lighter than Seale, hopped into
Sydney Amateur Athletic Club one evening and asked for
fight. Searle took him on, and often fell down before the
lieutenant s little taps upon the head. The crowd around
enjoyed the proceedings and lustily cheered the naval
hero, whom, after the spar, they bore in triumph to the
bath-room and rubbed down so vigorously that the tender
came off. So, when the lieutenant went back to
H.M.S. Pinafore, his shirt was sticking to his flesh. The
lieutenant has apologised for spoiling Seale’s reputation,

Mr, W. R. Wilson wishes to direct the atten-
tion of all good ticket-holders to an error in The Bulle-
tin’s recent page advt. of the St. Alban’s distribution.
Five mares, Insomnia, Wild Bose, Moth, Rosette, and
Parthia, were set down as stinted, whereas they should
have come under the heading of “dry.” Mr. Wilson is
anxious to prevent any possible disappointment of lucky
speculators who may happen to win the five prizes afore-
said.

Guineas Day, at Caulfield, has generally been a
bad time for ordinary punters. “ The Field ”is a better
horse than usual at the beginning of every Melh. racing
carnival, and the favorite can point to a long line of
historic precedents for getting upset. The rich Toorak
Handicap will probably fall to that good little mare
Gaillardia, with Common or Solanum there or there-
abouts. Also, Cook’s mare, The Parisienne, is to down
all competitors for the Guineas, and perhaps The Heroine
will cause a sensation by winning the Caulfield Stakes.
But for each of these events The Field is a good horse.
As for the Caulfield Cup, there are at least a
dozen horses that might be picked to win it, with a
special bit of good luck thrown in. Some of the most
likely ones are not certain starters thusfar. Devon, Hop-
scotch, Nobleman, Lord Richmond, and Mr. Samuel Cook
have good shows on paper.

is herein contained that I, in some fashion, prob-
ably discreditable, have made enough money out
ot politics to buy a business. The allegation is as
false as it is contemptible. I have never made
one penny politically outside of my Parliamentary
allowance, and, had no other source of income
been mine, I would have been bankrupt several
times ere now. For your information, let me say
that the Parliamentary returns of four years have
hardly sufficed to cover the expenses of three elec-
tions, one “ protest,” and the thousand and one
claims to which a Labor-member, more than any
other, is subjected. My business became mine at
the cost of my mother’s death.—Yours, George
Black, N.S.W. Legislative Assembly, Oct. 3.
WOOL FREIGHTS.
The Victorian Railway Department notifies that
for Victorian-grown wools it will in future charge
for actual weight in lieu of charging at so much
per bale, as formerly. It is inconceivable why
the department held so long to an unjust and
inequitable practice. The decision of the Com-
missioners in this matter will be appreciated by
wool-growers. Doubtless, the untiring agitation
for this alteration made by the National Wool
Company, of Melbourne, will be recollected, the
company having distinctly scored in carrying the
point.*

Mr. W. Jennings, Adelaide, S. A., formerly
of Hawthorn, near Melbourne,

“For the pasts or 4 years, I have been a
great sufferer from rheumatism and piles.
I tried all sorts of medicines, hut derived
no good from them. I chanced to read one
of your books and thought I would give
your Sarsaparilla a trial. I did so, and alter
/ %
taking one bollle I felt better, and after
taking 4 Hottlcs I was a new man. I was
sorry I never took it before, for it would
have saved me very much pain. ”

Charleville (Q.) is about to be reticulated

A lady guest (for six months) of the Gover-
nor of a Northern gaol seems to have put her foot
in it by having, on returning from the neighboring
pub., accidentally smashed the jug containing the
supper-beer of one or other of her custodians. An
enquiry is being held —in vc the supper-beer
ently—as no investigation is needed, it would seem,
in regard to prisoners beingallowed, in certain A us-
tralian “ quods,” to stroll abroad on their promising
to be “inby 9.” The writer knows aman who, from
experience, maintains that the jolliest, easiest,
and most “dolce far niente” life an Australian
can wish for is to get 12 months in some prisons
which it would not be prudent to name.

Years ago, in a very back-block (N.S.W.)
township, two women were charged before the
travelling P.M.—a “son of Erin’s Isle”—with
keeping a shanty. The P.M. evidently regarded
the offence as venial —at that date it was very
handy to be able to fill your flask without
reference to licensing considerations. He.
worked hard in the ladies’ favor, and eventually
dismissed the case, when up rose the prosecuting
constable and asked “his worship” what he was
to do with the jar of rum that had been seized on
the premises ? After due consideration, his wor-
ship replied : “ Well, constable, I think you had
better give the ladies the jar of rum to drink.

SWORN TESTIMONY. STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, THOS. MTJDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 327 Elizabeth-street, Sydney, in the Colony of New
South Wales, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows : Whereas I suffered severely from
a very troublesome affection of the Nerves, which affected me so much that I was quite unable to
attend to my business. I tried several doctors and many remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas I, as
a last hope, obtained some of Herr Rassmussen’s Purely Herbal “Alfaline Vitality Pills,”
which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare Completely Cured Me within a few weeks, and
although this is over five years ago I have remained well ever since. The Alfaline Pills also
cured my wife, and I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true. —

Nervousness Cured.
The well-known and popular representative of the Sydney BULLETIN, a gentleman whose testi-
mony carries specialweight, writes thus :To Herr Rassmussen.— Dear Sir,—l think it my duty to
inform you that a course of your Alfaline Vitality Pills acted very beneficially on my nervous system,
and, in consequence, I have recommended them to many friends, who have all been cured by their
use.—Yours, R. A. LUCKHAM.
A Magistrate Cured of Nervousness and Biliousness.
160 Elizabeth-st., Melb., July 18, 1892.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that a course of
your Alfaline Pills completely cured me of a severe case of biliousness,
wind and nervousness. I may also mention that several of rny friends
to whom I have recommended your remedies have derived great benefit
from them; therefore, I consider you are deserving of success, which'
I do most heartily wish you.
Yours gratefully, A. HARRIS, J.P.
A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir, —I hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,
allow me to say that you can make what use you may think proper of
this. Wishing you every success, allow me to remain, yours,
CATHERINE HAGERMAN.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—-In the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney 1 had n
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W;
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline
Remedies have acted most wonderful in my case, and I consider that
the great virtues you claim for them have been entirely substantiated—
not only in my case, but in several of my family and acquaintances to

efficacious than any remedy yet brought before the public. I consider
you are second to none as a human benefactor.
I am, yours truly, EDWARD DREW.

EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS
m THE
TREATMENT OF OBESITY.
“ Our corpulent readers will be glad to learn how to positively lose two stone in about a month with the greatest possible benefit in health, strength, and muscle by a comparatively new system. It is a
singular paradox that the patient, returning quickly to a healthy state, with increased activity of brain, digestive and other organs, naturally requires more food than hitherto, yet, notwithstanding this, ha
absolutely loses in weight one or two pounds daily, as the weighing-machine will prove. Thus there is no suggestion of starvation. It is an absolute success, and the author, Mr. F. 0. Russell, of London,
England, who has devoted years of study to the subject, absolutely guarantees a noticeable reduction within twenty-four hours of commencing the treatment. This is different with other diseases, for the
patient in some oases may go for weeks without being able to test whether the Physician has rightly treated him, and may have derived no real or apparent improvement in health. Here, we repeat, the
author guarantees it in twenty-four hours, the scale to be the unerring judge. The treatment aims at the actual root of the disease, so that the superfluous fat does not return when discontinuing the
treatment. It is perfectly harmless. We advise our readers to call the attention of stout friends to this, because, sincerely, we think they ought to know. For their information, we may say, a book,
“Corpulency and the Cure,” 256 pages, price sixpence, containing a reprint of press notices from some hundreds of Medical and other journal's (British and Foreign), and other interesting particulars,
including the “Recipe,” can be had from Mr. F. C. Russell, Woburn House, 27 Store Street, Bedford Square, London, W.C., England, Australian Booksellers, or post free, on receipt of six penny
stamps, from GORDON & GOTCH, 123 Pitt Street, Sydney.
Mark Twain, after touring Australia and
Maoriland, will run across to Ceylon and then
visit Mauritius and South Africa. This tour will
take a year, and, at its close, he will retire to
’Murka to write a second volume of his “ Tramp
Abroad.” He was offered .£2OOO for ten lectures
in London, but that is “off ” until after the book
is finished.
N.S. W; Council, which only kicks when
its. own private interests are involved or when its
private corn is stood upon, passed Premier Reid’s
Loan Bill through committee this time with hardly
a murmur; Nobody objected much to the relief
works, and the forest-thinning job, and the re-
pairs to old dredges being passed on to posterity.
The only good thing of any importance which the
Council has done for many years past was
to block the Loan Bill last session, and, find-
ing that it had done a good thing, it got scared
there and then, and undid it with all possible
speed;
Stated on what should be unquestionable
authority that a Quinquennial Parliaments Bill
will be introduced this session in Queensland.
Triennial Parliaments was one of the original
planks of the Griffilwraith - eurn-Boodlewraith
gang ; but that’s nothing. The Nelson Ministry
will do anything to get away from its responsi-
bility to the people. To this end the agents of
the National Ass organisation, of which Nelson is
president, are using every possible device to knock
independent electors off the roll and keep them
off. To this end, once elected again, with
another subservient Parliament, they would be
glad to postpone another appeal to the country for
five years, during which bank and syndicate
schemes may breed unchecked. The devil help
Kanakaland !
W. M. Hughes, a prominent member
N.S.W. Labor-party, stated recently to a large
public meeting that the Reid Ministry didn’t want
the land or income tax, or any other democratic
measures, but was driven to support them by the
Labor members, and, in effect, that it was selling
its convictions for the sake of office. The Labor
politicians are much given to talking in this strain,
and it is woefully bad policy. If the Government
is sincere, then it is unjust as well as impolitic.
If it isn’t sincere, then it is not unjust but only
utterly foolish. Hughes and co. demand that the
Government shall do certain things, and, at the
same time, they point out carefully that if the
Government does these things it is a crawling and
wormy affair that is going down on its stomach in
the dust to save its salary. This sort of language
may at last make even G. H. Reid coalesce with
somebody or anybody in order to have the joy of
doing without Hughes and co. It is always un-
wise for the small partner to kick the large one so
long as he is doing what the small partner wants.

Phil. Mowbray in a recent Worker :
From what I have seen of hushwomen and girls, if they
get a vote they will plump for any Syrian or Chinese
fruit-hawker that pats up. The familiarity of many girls
with niggers would be inducement to a white man suffi-
cient to seduce him, I have called the attention of
many fathers and brothers to it. There is no mincing
of the matter with me, simply because the scandal has
now become so notorious that it is often dangerous to
mention it.
The Thursday Island Japs sometimes con-
tribute to the Torres Straits Pilot. The scribe
of the community is K. Matsuoka, Esq., of the
s Japanese Club. Of certain of his enemies K.
Matsuoka caustically remarks : “ Ah ! the skin of
their foreheads is like an iron, and it being insen-
sible in any way, they are thick and hard.” A
truly pungent piece of satire, extracted from a
column of most amusing “ pidgin ” English.
The latest libel on Australian trains comes
from Bundaberg (Q.). As the tram left the
station a man was seen on the platform, waving
the departing locomotive to come back—which it
didn’t. When the train arrived at a station some
miles away, there was the missing traveller calmly
smoking and waiting on the platform. On missing
the train he had caught and saddled a horse and
ridden on in pursuit.

Sydney Telegraph tne other day sent its
most impressionable young reporter to interview
Mrs. Dean and Mrs. Seymour ; the result makes
rich reading. The guileless Mrs. Seymour calmly
admitted that “I did wrong 28 years ago, but I
washed my hands of it all when I came here” —
and this in face of the fact that at the original
police-court hearing and before the Dean Com-
mission she had to more or less admit having
assisted in the management of a notorious house
of ill-fame only a little more than two years ago !
Said Mrs. Dean ;
“A great many people have run away with the idea
that mother did it.”
Mrs. Seymour : “ I wasn’t there.”
Mrs. Dean: ‘‘lt lies between him and me, and 1 know
that lam innocent. I saw what Dean had said in this
morning’s Daily Telegraph. I think it is a pack of false-
hoods. I wonder he doesn’t drop."
Mrs. Seymour: 11 It is a wonder he didn’t drop.”
And when Mrs. Dean remarked that Dean was
‘‘so kind and considerate —he would have the
doctor,” Mrs. Seymour chimed in: “Of course
that was a blind—poison you first and then fetch
the doctor.” After ascertaining that Dean always
took the biggest chop for himself and gave Mrs.
Dean the little one, and left none at all for Mrs.
Seymour, the reporter left :
Just before the interview closed, the reporter asked
Mrs. Dean, who was looking exceptionally well in her
neatly-fitting navy blue dress (humph !), if she still felt
the effects of the poisons. “ Well, Idoin my feet,” she
replied ; “ when 1 stand up they pain me, and they keep
very cold. Otherwise 1 am.quite well, and have such a
good appetite, due to the strjchnine, I suppose. Mr.
Smith tells me I shall he all right when the effects totally
disappear.” “At any rate, Mrs. Dean,” the reporter
ventured to say, “your complexion does not appear to
have suffered.” “ Oh, no,” she replied, “ I always had a
good complexion ; hut, if it is better than usual, it is due
to the arsenic, I suppose.”
Tims we see how an all-wise Providence brings
good out of evil. They tried to poison Mrs. Dean
with strychnine—and it improves her appetite ;
with arsenic—and it renews her complexion.
Hallelujah !

FLUID
th
DISINFECTION WITH "SANITAS.”
:o:
A searching investigation recently made by Dr. A. B. Griffiths, F.R.S.E., F.C.S., the well-
known Bacteriologist, has established the fact that very minute proportions of “ Sanitas”
Fluid, “Sanitas” Oil and “ Sauitas ” Emulsion suffice to quickly destroy the microbes of
Cholera, Diphtheria, Typhoid Fever, Scarlet Fever, Pneumonia, Measles, Inliuenza,
Pueiperal Fever, Glanders, Yellow Fever, &c.
It has also been shown that the vapour of “Sanitas” Oil, as generated from the
“Sanitas” Disinfecting Fumigator, has a most destructive action on the germs of
disease, and that, consequently, its inhalation must be most beneficial in the treatment
of Diphtheria, Phthisis, and all Diseases of the Lungs and Throat.
When used for fumigating sick rooms, Dr. Griffiths’ experiments show that a short time
serves to destroy all the genus that are piese it in the air.
11 is experiments also demonstrate that when “Sanitas” Fluid is sprayed about dwelling
rooms, the microbes of disease are entirely and quickly destroyed, and that small
quantities of “Sanitas” Emulsion equally well destroy the same germs when present
in water. _ Of great importance is the further fact which is brought out by Dr. Griffiths’
investigations, namely, that not only do “Sanitas” Disinfectants kill all disease germs,
but they exhibit this great advantage over oth *r preparations—namely, that they also
destroy the poisonous substances which are pro laced by disease germs and to which
they largely owe their fearful character.
Dr. Griffiths concludes his Report with these word-i;—
“There is no doubt that ‘ Sanitas ’ Oil and ‘Sanitas’ Fluid are most powerful dis-
“ infectants; consequently, they should not only be used for disinfecting rooms, hospitals,
“ barracks, prisons, &c., but also employed in the treatment of infectious diseases, such
“ as cholera, diphtheria, scarlet fever, measles, glanders, typhoid fever, tuberculosis,
“ puerperal fever, &c.”

[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
For years I had longed to settle on the land. I
had developed an insatiable appetite for all that
concerned it, and read advertisements of farms to
be disposed of “ for satisfactory reasons ” much as
a connoisseur sips at a favorite old vintage. It
was a lovely dream. But, alas, it was only a
dream.
I was reporting at the time in a Maori-
land township which boasted of its two daily
papers and a population of 5000 souls.. Well, you
know what that means—writing puff-paragraphs
for every greedy little truckster in the place, and
perpetrating palpable and absurd lies about each
struggling theatrical group that managed to land
dead-broke in our midst its remnant of seedy
men who smelt of liquor, and frowsy women who
smothered a similar odour in a cloud of patchouli.
These little duties, humane enough as they may
have been, 1 did not like. Indeed, I cordially
hated them, and many a time I felt such con-
tempt for what I wrote that I could have kicked
myself round the dingy little office gleefully, and
found much relief therefrom, had the thing been
possible. It was the theatrical puffs that were
my greatest curse. Daily they had to be ground
out of my rapidly depleting brain for a whole
fortnight before the “artists” appeared, and daily
afterwards until they had managed to scrape
enough together to carry them on to the next
long-suffering hamlet, some 30 miles to the north.
On one occasion, and one only, did I try to
emancipate myself. I ventured to write, not
what I thought—that would have been simply
madness —but with a touch less of adulation than
was usual. And I had good reason for not trying
the experiment a second time. The “leading
gentleman” of the company went into the office
next morning before I arrived—mine was the
morning rag—and there was the very devil of a
din, during which every possible liberty was taken
with my name, and with my reputation as a
dramatic critic. But that did not affect me.
What did, however, was a substantial hint that
unless I could confine myself to the orthodox style
of theatrical “criticism” obtaining in that publi-
cation, my place would be filled by somebody who
could.
The period ot inflated values had just collapsed,
and the cry of the unemployed was surging nearer
home day by day. And I had a feeling that if I
lost my billet I might be driven even to the plight
of the theatrical weary-wanderer—a condition I
loathed and pitied above all others. Against that
there was the perennial hope of being able with
care to save enough to enable me to satisfy my
craving for the land. The highest flight of my
ambition was to settle down and live a life of
quiet and independence in the crisp air of the
blue hills whence sprung the babbling creek that
gave its name to the town. And so I confined
my pen to the customary rut, produced my miser-
able little paragraphs, and wrote “journalist”
after my name as a description of such work with
all the bitterness that was in me.
Things went on in much the same old way until
some six or seven months after my experiment
with the theatrical notices, when the Harris-
Delamere company appeared in our midst. They
Were a strange collection, and their arrival marked
(in epoch in the dramatic annals of that ham-
let. Never before, and never. I believe, since
have such a wardrobe and sucli stage-properties
been seen on the local boards. The glare of the
footlights may be depended on tocovera thousand
sins—l know it from experience now—bub no glare
could conceal the evidence of vicissitudes borne by
the wardrobe of the Harris-Delamere company.
But, with all their shortcomings, they had one
redeeming feature—pretty women. There were
only three of them, but all were good-looking, the
youngest of the trio particularly so. Miss Enid
Alleyn she called herself. On the stage, in
spite of the many drawbacks, she was irresistible,
and I fell a victim to her charms the first night.
In the interval the usual thing happened. The
manager strolled along, asked me how I liked the
play, and invited me to the usual nip. It was the
nipping that was one of my troubles with the
theatrical people. They seemed to look upon it
as a necessity to shout for the representatives of
the press, and it was difficult to escape from it. I
found no pleasure in the sensation that I was
drinking the money of toil-worn men and women,
who, possibly, were 'going short that my ghoulish
appetite might be appeased, or, rather, that my
contemptible’ little paragraphs might still affect
to befool a weary public. And though I made it
a practice to shout in return to satisfy what rag
of conscience was left in me, I knew all the time
what a hollow mockery it was.
That night, however, things seemed different.
I was in a spending mood, and money was
scattered freely. In tlie end I was introduced
to Miss Enid Alleyn, and . nothing would
satisfy me but to entertain her and the manager
at supper. Of this banquet I need not speak.
Suffice it to say that neither office nor lodgings
saw me again that night.
Well, of course, it was all over with me after
that. The next night, and the next, I supped
witli her again. But no manager was present on
those occasions. I was liberal with the wine as
with everything, and if my companion did not
judge her capacity so well as perhaps she might,
what was that to me? I was in love. I was
blind, and I was happy.
This sort of thing could only have one end. I
thri w in my lot with the Harris-Delamere co.,
and when they moved on to the next town I
moved with them. Farming had lost its lure.
Ambition was dead. All I desired was Enid,
and she I had.
I had saved a little money, some 70odd pounds,
for my old love, but it went by degrees into the
lap of the new. It was soon gone. How, I never
troubled to ask. But when I had no longer a
penny my new friends stuck to me bravely, and,
although I am afraid I cut but a sorry figure on
the boards, I always shared whatever there was to
share.
Thus I have existed for five years, wandering
to and fro, the shabbiest of the shabby race I
used to look upon with so much pity in the old
days. And Enid, what of her? I was deceived
and cheated. Not by her, but by myself. I
thought it was a passion of a lifetime, and I found
it but the dream of an hour. And yet I still live
on in the same old life. A hundred times I have
tried to break it off, and a hundred times I have
failed. I have not the heart or the courage to do
it. You think it very easy, no doubt. But you
are a fool. Let a habit eat into your soul and try
to shake it off by a sudden effort ; and you will
fail as I have failed.
And she ? Does she still care for me ? Ido not
know. How can I ? Somehow I contrive to
make her think I retain some spark of the old
feeling, and may she nob do the same to me ? I
might find out, bub I have nob the heart or the
courage, as I said before, to ask and to lay bare
my feelings.
And thus I live on, a human derelict.

sion one infuriated animal actually forced its way into the
vestry of the church where Bishop Thornton, of Ballarat,
was preaching. The bishop unwound the immense stock-
whip which was hanging on the communion-rail, and,
handing the waddy to the incumbent, these two muscular
Christians charged boldly into the vestry. For ten minutes
lia crack of the whip and the thud of the waddy were the
only sounds that reached the congregation. Then the
bishop and incumbent returned, and the former, drop-

with “ I pass on to the next place,” as if nothing had hap-

Ho started talking to a Bulletin man in
the tram. He said he kept a pub. this
side St. Arnaud, and that he had comedown
to Mtlb. for the show. No, he was not much

intertsted him most was a howling toff with
ginger Lair, and a big dude crutch, and a polished
belltopper, and other fixings en suite, who was
strolling round with a lot of swell people, and
looking “as if he owned a di’mond mine.” The
publican from this side St. Arnaud explained :
“ I thought I reckernised him, an’ after follerin’
him up a bit I was dead certain he’s the chap
what drifted into my pub. seven months ago, a
reg’lar beat, carryin’ a eighteen-penny bluey an’
lookin’ dead done up. H j slapped a letter down
on my bar, an’ arst was that good enough fer a
plain drunk. I went over it. It said he’d come
in for thirty thousan’ quid. Thinkin’ it a fake I
sent him travellin’, dry as grit, although he pro-
raised to square for all he could hold as soon as he
reached Bealibar.” The publican sighed. “Seems
it was a straight affair,” he continued ruefully,
“ an’he might a-bin restin’at my pub. yet. No,
damn it! I didn’t injoy the blessed show,”

According to authoritative statements at a
Melb. municipal conference, 5’6 per cent, of all
cattle locally slaughtered are afflicted with tuber-
culosis. Cattle fatten more quickly after being
seized with the germs of the disease. Marasmus
in children is due to tubercle in the bowel, usually
contracted from the milk imbibed. Melb. city
abattoirs are the only ones under effective super-
vision, and they deal with but a fraction of the
meat-supply, because slaughtermen prefer the lax
supervision, or no-supervision, of other abattoirs.
There is no reason why the municipalities should
nob be given an absolute control of the meat-
supply.
“ Canada,” writes an expatriated Austra-
lian to a Bulletin correspondent, “ is no goodlor
the laborer. It is a country of vast monopolies.
Sioux Indians, Chinese, Japanese, are the laborers
of Canada. I believe the Bulletin is right—
Australia is the best country in the whole world
for the workman. Labor’s pay is ss. per day of
10 hours on the Pacific Coast, and on the Atlantic
Coast only 3s. 9d. per day of 10 hours ; the
general pay in the East of Canada has not been
any better for the last 10 years, and very little
pay or work can be got at that price. After pay-
ing for board your wages at the best are 2s. 6d.
per day for 10 hours’ work, and you are lucky to
get employment even at that price.”
Dear Bulletin, —N.S. W. Lands Minister
Carruthers proposes to abolish the ballot between
rival claimants for selection, and make the Land
Boards arbiters. The ballot has its disadvantages;
bub the other is a doubtful expedient, even if the
House would sanction it. It plays into the hands of
theland-agents and places the Boards in an awkward
position. Also, the Land Boards would have to
sib much more frequently than they now do.
Fancy half-a-dozen applicants for a certain block,
each with as good a case as the others. They pay
their deposits and wait three months for the Board
to sib. The certain result is five would-be selectors
with a rankling grievance against the Law and the
administration. Kissing goes by favor ! Better
stick to the ballot. — Treble B.

Dear Bulletin, —You sometimes gibe at
Hingland’s custom of taking full credit for the
work of Scotchmen or Irishmen. Why not look
nearer home for a joke? Peter Jackson, the black-
fellow, is a genuine “ Australian champion ”
according to A.N.A. notions. A violinist, named
Johann Kruse, has been paying a flying visit from
Europe to his presumably native Victoria, and
the Melb. dailies “blow” about him with much
vigor. Thus the Argus : “Mr. Kruse’s reading
of the concerto was that of a cultured, musicianly
mind. . . . At the conclusion the audience
recognised in the artist who had presented this
superb panorama before its mental vision a young
Australian whom it delighted to honor.” The
Age concedes a point to the artist’s very German
name by generally calling him Herr, but thinks
that “regarded as a Vic. product Johann Kruse
is a violinist of whom we all have a right to feel
nroud. It is, in a sense, true, of course, that we
only supplied the raw material, and that the
credit of working it up belongs to Germany.”
The raw material, observe, was of German origin
and has been worked up in the land it sprang
from, yet Herr Kruse, whose family can’t have
been settled in Victoria for much more than fifty
years, anyway, is a Victorian of whom we ought
to feel proud.—Yours, Max Fieck.

“Snell” : The Bulletin, by spreading
the idea that crude kerosene is an excellent
fertiliser for the hair, brought about a serious
accident in a Melbourne barber’s shop, the other
night. lam informed by the presiding artist, a
worthy young man who ’tends church and whose
tote is conducted on moral principles, that a
regular customer, a musician, turned up as usual
to be burnt off, but as soon as the lighted taper
touched his hair, which was very profuse, the mass
ignited, and the musician jumped from his chair
witli a fearful yell and charged out of the shop.
When the barber pulled himself together and
followed his flaming customer, he found the pro-
fessor standing on his head in a horse-trough,
with the kindly assistance of a constable, who
wanted to know if the man was insured, and
seemed disposed to arrest the “clip” for arson.
Petroleum may be a good top-dressi a g, but it has

A Maoriland paper : “ Benjamin Shoure,
who is said to be an advocate of the single-tax,
took a fatal dose of poison.” Shoure was an
ardent single-taxer, and when he arrived at
Wellington from Europe he was so crushed by the
public indifference about George’s great theory,
that he took a large dose of morphia. Ho was
baled out at the hospital and recovered. Then he
removed to Sydney, and was so oppressed by the
want of interest in the single-tax there that he
took more morphia. A policeman found him in-
sensible on a wharf, and rushed him off to the
hospital, and he was resuscitated a second time.
Then he went to Auckland, and after a vain
endeavour to convert the people of that city to the
single-tax theory, he evidently decided that a
world which wasn’t in a state of frantic excite-
ment about the single-tax wasn’t worth living in,
so he swallowed a large quantity of morphia and
died. What a lot of single-taxers have wild,
morphia-looking eyes ! The Bulletin can count
up at least a dozen in Sydney alone who carry
either the stamp of morphia or the bulgy glare of
epilepsy. It is a ghastly thing to be dreadfully
in earnest.

that one of his mistresses was unfaithful, learned
that she had an assignation on a particular even-
ing at her own apartments with the Due do Belle-
ville. Just as supper-hour arrived, Henri knocked
and found the table prepared for two. There
were a couple of partridges and a loaf of bread on
the cloth, and, after a few commonplaces, Henri
drew up chairs for himself and his hostess. All
proceeded swimmingly, when suddenly the royal
visitor out off half the loaf, scooped out the
crumb, jammed one of the partridges into the
cavity, and fired it under the bed. ‘ Sire !’
exclaimed the terrified lady, ‘ what are you
doing ?’ 4 Madame,’ returned the merry monarch
as he rose, 'everybody must live.’ Making ( a
graceful adieu, he forthwith quitted the scene.”

O’er woman’s rights and politics,
Or freedom, etiquette, and morals,
And yet their hearts he firmly knit
Whilst cherishing opposing wishes ;
But hopeless is it when they split,
Upon that point—Who’ll wash the dishes
The Burial Service of a Musician .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We gathered around the open grave, ten of us, and
gazed down silently at the plain deal coffin. None
of us knew any burial-service, but something of
the sort seemed necessary, so we stood puzzling
our brains to recall some good action of the
deceased. After a lapse of several minutes Jones
mentioned how the corpse had once treated
Cornish Joe to a big burst. The remark was
better loft unsaid, for we all remembered that
the sequel to that action was his running through
the traveller’s pockets and abstracting all the con-
tents thereof.
There was another silence of five minutes while
we moved our feet about, shuffling the loose earth
into rude circles. Then Darbyshire whispered
that perhaps if we sang something it would be
better than keeping dead silence. There was no
answer to Darbyshire’s suggestion.
By and bye, Murphy could stand it no longer.
“ Boys,” he cried, “ d’ye moind the toime he did
Ginger Smith outer a pen at Gerogery ? A low,
sneaking hound he was.”
“Aye, he was that,” chipped in M'Dougall.
“Do you no remember him saltin’ the South
claim, too ? ”
We all remembered it well, Our tongues were
loosened at once, and each of us had some anec-
dote to relate of the perfidy of the departed. For
an hour or more we stayed, until the pauses got
longer between the yarns, and ultimately conver-
sation came to a stop. We shovelled in the earth
and left a yellow mound to mark the spot. Then
we made for the Miner’s Arms to drink the corpse’s
health.
“Fill ’em up, mon,” said M'Dougall. “He
was a dom’d scoondrel, but, my oath, he could
play the Jew’s harp !”
BONDINGE.
What a Colling wood (Melb.) woman dosed
her husband with, the other night: Castor-oil and
milk, brandy, linseed poultice, a go of salts, a cup
of tea, and three-penn’orth of rum (hot). And
yet it was five hours before that iron-framed
man died in a fit. But the poor soul meant
well. Where is the man whose wife is not angry
if he does not eat ?
Victoria is positively struggling along
without any assistance from the delectable Davies
family, a state of things undreamt-of in the by-
gone boom-time. The other day an opportunity
offered for “chucking” J. M. Davies out of the
Leg. Council, and he had to go. J.M. was the
pious, prudent Davies who ever maintained a
beatific front. Fat Man is sorry to lose him
from the Council. Lawyer Godfrey was the
valuable means of unseating J.M. Among the
comparatively Radical property-owners of South
Melbourne there was a strong majority for God-
frey, on the ground that he used to kick up
a row at depositors’ meetings. Twenty per
cent, of all the votes polled in this fight came
from South Melbourne, and so the retiring mem-
ber was retired for an indefinite period.
