ANCIENT HUNGERFORDS REST IN FARLEIGH CASTLE, SOMERSET
FARLEIGH CASTLE, in Somerset, two miles from Norton St.
Philip, dates from the late fourteenth century, though the
history of its site goes back much further, as testified by the dis-
covery of Roman coins and the remains of a Roman villa with its
baths and tessellated pavements.
Smewin, a Saxon, owned the manor under Edward the Con-
fessor (1042-1066), and at the time of the Conquest Sir Roger De
Curcelle possessed it. In 1369 Sir Thomas Hungerford, first Speaker
of the House of Commons, acquired it, and for many generations
the Castle remained the property of the Hungerford family. The
family fortunes prospered during the reigns of Henry V and Henry
yi, when Lord Walter Hungerford, who served at Agincourt and
was Lord High Treasurer of Cherbourg in France, acquired by
marriage the great Devonshire estates of the Peverells.
The Castle, which consists of two courts defended by walls,
towers, gatehouse and drawbridge, fell into ruin during the
eighteenth century. The Chapel, pictured above, is, however, in a
good state of preservation, and is the most interesting feature of
the Castle. It contains a magnificent oak roof and some particularly
fine altar tombs of the Hungerford family, whose violent deaths
bear some resemblance to a Greek tragedy, for Lord Hungerford
was beheaded at Hexham in 1463 ; Sir Thomas beheaded at Bemer-
ton in 1469; Lady Agnes hanged at Tyburn in 1523 and Lord
Walter beheaded at the Tower of London in 1540. In the Civil
War Lord Hungerford held the Castle for the King, but surrendered.
After the Restoration Sir Edward, nicknamed “the extravagant,
entertained Charles II at Farleigh Castle, and his son brought the
family line to an end.
The walls of the Chapel are hung with family crests and a
collection of armour brought from Crecy, Poitiers, Agincourt and
Calais. The Chapel also contains a Jacobean pulpit and examples
of medieval stained glass.

A SPANISH BYRON.
" In a period when large sections of the
British Empire have fallen off like ice-
bergs from a glacier to enjoy the bless-
ings—and the perils—of independence,
Emil Ludwig’s Bolivar (\V. H. Allen,
Ltd.) is of great political interest: for
Simon Bolivar, the Libertador, was the
man who, almost single-handed, freed
the nations of South America from
Spanish domination.
Bolivar’s story, lit with flashes of gal-
lantry and ennobled with the Liberator’s
personal devotion to the highest ideals of
democratic government, is a drama of
increasing and deadly disillusion. In
1824, when the war against Spain had
already changed into an internal struggle
for power, he wrote:
I am so mortally tired that I can see
nobody, take my meals with nobody. The
presence of a human being makes me ill.
In this horrible spot on the coast I live
among trees. Overnight I have changed
into a misanthrope. But do not imagine
I am sad. This is no physical illness, no
personal mortification; it is disgust with
mankind and society. It rises from the
most profound conviction I ever reached.
... .Let us turn our eyes in another direc-
tion and consider the convulsion of human
affairs. At all times the works of men
were weak; today they are like immature
embryos, perishing before they develop.
From all sides, terror invades me, and
the noise of falling things. This is the
epoch of catastrophes. Everything seems
merely to glide past; how foolish it would
be of me to think I could stand fast in
such convulsions, in the midst of the moral
destruction of the world.
This was his personal tragedy: a man
who had dreamed of—and had held —
unlimited power and who learned how
easily it could be destroyed: assassins,
instruments of a rival general, breaking
into his apartments at night and the
Liberator, while his mistress held them
at bay with a sword, dropping from a
window to hide in a ditch. And be-
cause, even more than he desired power
he longed for glory, a glittering
reputation in history, and he could have
true glory only if his achievements lasted
and his revolution proved constructive,
the political disasters of Bolivar’s time
were his own disaster.
When all the South American nations
had been liberated —a few by their own
efforts but most by Bolivar’s armies—
they were to meet, so he had dreamed for
years, in a grand congress at Panama,
where there would be established some-
thing like a South American League of
Nations, united in eternal friendship.
When at last the congress met, only
Colombia and Peru, the two States under
his immediate control, were present, with
Mexico and Guatemala. Bolivia—named
after the Liberator and established, in
part, in accordance with a democratic
constitution he had laid down for it —
was absent because a revolution was
threatening. The Argentine would not
come because Bolivar had refused to help
it in its war against Brazil. Chile had
excused itself. Brazil would not attend
because it wished to remain neutral in
the fight between Spain and the former
colonies. Bolivar, knowing that the con-
ference would be a failure, did not
attend. He wrote shortly afterwards —
in one of his amazingly frank letters to
his subordinate and would-be rival.
General Paez, who was even then actively
engaged in betraying him:
For sixteen years men have been gather-
ing to cause a general conflagration and to
blot out our victories, our glory, the hap-
piness of the people and the freedom of
us all. I shall soon believe that nothing
but ashes will remain of all we have done.
The martial spirit has suffered more among
our_ compatriots than among our enemies.
Believe me, we are standing on a monstrous
volcano; the portent is not imagined, nor
is it a poetic image; it is only too true.
By a kind of miracle, we have kept a kind
of hazardous balance, as happens when
two great waves meet and, for a moment,
create a fictitious calm. Navigators are
familiar with the phenomenon, I was at
that point between Venezuela and New
Granada; there was a point of rest, but
it will vanish with the first waves. Every-
thing will return to the womb of creation,
will be reduced to primal matter. Yes,
matter, for everything returns to the void.
The hatred between classes will come gal-
loping back, like all suppressed things.
Every idea will claim supremacy, every
hand will be stretched out to grasp the
marshal’s baton, every toga will be a cloak
of confusion. Cries of despair will arise
on all sides, and the terrible thing is that
everything I say is true.
He wrote towards the last, prematurely
aged at 48, “I am old, ill, disappointed,
slandered and badly paid. I have never
approved revolution, and in the end I
even regretted our revolution against
Spain.” And, at the same period, when
on one day he would think he was dying
—as he was —on another that he would go
in exile to Jamaica to find peace and hap-
piness, and on another that he would
plunge himself once more into war and
politics, avenge the assassination of his
most faithful follower. General Sucre,
and make one last attempt to restore
order in Colombia—he summed up:
In twenty years of government I have
arrived at some few certainties. First,
America is ungovernable for us. Second,'
to serve a revolution is to plough the sea.
Third, the only thing a man in America
can do is to emigrate. Fourth, this country
is sure to fall into the hands of an un-
chained mob, to relapse into little tyrannies
of all colors and races. Fifth, devoured
by all crimes and destroyed by chaos, we
shall be reconquered by Europe. Sixth, if
any part of the world were to return to
primeval chaos, it would be this part of
America.
All of which, if nations were ever
guided by the lessons of history—which
they are not —should be a sufficient warn-
ing against lightly jumping out of the
family buggy to ride alone on a brumby.
Reading Bolivar, the thought occurs
again and again, especially when
Colombia is insisting on the Liberator’s
appointing himself dictator —a situation
which invariably gratified his pride and
wounded his conscience—and when
Mexico is inviting a Bourbon prince to
sit uneasily on its uneasy throne for a
year or two —that the fatal weakness
brought about by revolution was the loss
of the symbol and principle of unity em-
bodied in the Spanish monarchy.
Except for Bolivar, whose brilliant and
reckless personality was not suited for
the petty cares of government and who,
in any case, could not govern an un-
governable people, there was no point of
stability in the whole South American
continent. The nations, breaking free
from a distant domination which pressed
very mildly upon them by comparison
with the tyrannies they inflicted on them-
selves, completed that destruction of Spain
which wars in Europe had begun and, in
the process, destroyed themselves. No
doubt such a revolution —especially in
this instance of the Spanish colonies,
Whose history from the beginning was
turbulent, bloody and anarchic —was in-
evitable ; but it was not on that account
any the more sensible.
There are times when Bolivar, in his
Napoleonic dreams of glory, in his acute
sensitiveness to the opinions of the
foreign press, and, chiefly, in his inability
to make his compatriots live up to his
ambitions, reminds one of Mussolini. But
Mussolini was so much a fraud as a
man of action that he could not even be
told the truth about the incompetence
of his armies, whereas Bolivar’s
crossing of the Andes is ranked
as one of the greatest military feats
of all time. Mussolini was a cynic
trained in the school of Machiavelli,
whereas Bolivar, despite disillusion and
ambition, held fierily to the faith of demo-
cracy, taking his ideals from Rousseau
and the philosophers of Athens. Musso-
lini, like Napoleon, was squat and
paunchy; Bolivar, with his long, aristo-
cratic face and flashing gaiety, had the
spare and upright figure of the cavalier.
Far more strongly, he reminds one
of Byron, who named his yacht after
him and who, had not fever at Misso-
longhi terminated his attempt to trans-
late poetry into action, might have cut
precisely such a shining figure among the
squabbling rabble of Greece as Bolivar
did in Colombia. Though their careers
in love were different —Bolivar’s mar-
riage in early life was happy but ended
tragically when his young wife died;
whereupon Bolivar vowed never to marry
again—the poet and the Liberator were
equally fascinating to and fascinated by
women; so much so in Bolivar’s case
that when his quartermaster, before he
entered a town on one of his campaigns
in Peru, sent orders, “For the General,
good food, a good bed, etc., etc., etc.,” the
town councillors, after pondering the
meaning of “etc., etc., etc.,” laid hold of
the three prettiest girls in the place to
present to the Liberator . . . who, inci-
dentally, liberated them.
Bolivar,, in spite of his outbursts of
rage and disgust at mankind, seems the
lighter of the two spirits. Byron’s mis-
anthropy sprang from the very roots of
his being, but Bolivar, in his blackest
moods, seems never to have been totally
unaware of the consoling brilliance of
his glory. On the day that he would dis-
miss fame, power, Colombia and all man-
kind for ever, he would discuss with a
different correspondent new campaigns
for fame and power, new plans for his
hopeless republic and his renewed faith
in democracy. Bolivar danced half the
night, and Byron, in solitary gloom,
drank brandy. Yet both, to an extra-
ordinary degree of similarity, typified the
spirit of their period, the crusading
liberalism of the nineteenth century,
dazzled, paradoxically, by the military
glory of Napoleon. I
Emil Ludwig’s biography is con-
cerned, rightly enough, with Bolivar’s
personality rather than with any political
significance that may be drawn from
his career. The intention is simply “to
paint a portrait,” excluding all detail that
would distract attention from the central
figure. In the opening chapters a kind
of sentimental slickness is used to cover
up the absence of documentary evidence
as to Bolivar’s temperament in boyhood.
As the book progresses and as Bolivar’s
eloquent and revealing letters become
available—-he shared with Byron a gift
for the ringing phrase—this weakness
disappears. Perhaps because Emil Lud-
wig was a shade too competent, the book
is not wholly satisfying as a history.
Something of the roughness of life is
missing. On the other hand, the story is
admirably compact, swift in movement,
reading like a vivid historical novel.
Elizabeth Riddell's Poems.
The distinguishing qualities of Eliza-
beth Riddell’s Poems (Ure Smith Pty.
Ltd.) are a rich and colorful imagery and
the sparkle of epigram:
It is with some surprise that one
realises, among the tropic landscapes or
in the sunlight of wit, that almost all the
poems are concerned, one way or an-
other, with death.
Sometimes, as in “Lifesaver,” the theme
is stated clearly and sharply:
He was carried shoulder high
Up the alleys of the sun;
And the heat
Washed him over from his head to his feet,
But you cannot give the body back breath
With a flagon full of sun.
He is drowned, the tall one.
Thin brother Death
Has him by the throat
On the sand, in the sun.
Sometimes, as in the six poems on old
age, the note is more subdued, tempered
by resignation or enriched by pictures of
life lived to the full. In “A Note on
Greece” the tragedy has become distant
and statuesque:
The unstilled voices of the insistent philo-
sophic dead,
The voices of old men
Who walked on legs as stiff as crutches
And fell at last, debating still, to lie
Pointing a teacher’s finger at the sky.
In “Carnival” the threat is concealed;
only an image of the grass springing up
again after the merry-go-round and the
crowds have departed indicates that the
theme is still the transience of life. In
“Incidence of Love in a White-Collar
Suburb” the threat appears to be only
of monotony, yet it still, as it does in all
the poems, however it may be masked or
subdued, carries tragic implications:
In the shadow of the leaning mountain, in
the place
Between the leaning mountain and the sea,
In the downdrift of light I saw his face,
The face of my lover and my enemy.
And saw it plain, There will be no surprise
As time records betrayal and delight.
A love affair has certain scheduled lies
And history repeats itself at night.
The poems, so menacing in the single
theme underlying their diversity, might
well be expected to leave an impression
of gloom or that peculiar kind of tragic
delight conveyed by the lean and deadly
poetry of A. E. Housman. But the effect
of this book is the opposite; of a pleasant
lyricism, of color, gaiety and wit.
This is partly to be explained by the
fact that the repetition of the theme
throughout the book —effective as is each
poem in isolation —reduces the tragic
effect of the whole. Elizabeth Riddell
has a habit of ending her poems with the
stab of a knife.
But mere repetition would not trans-
form a tragic book of verse into one of
gaiety and charm. Except in the love
lyrics, some of which are very fine, the
tragic emotion in Poems does not run
deep. Elizabeth Riddell’s approach to
tragedy is essentially pictorial and epi-
grammatic, and the figure of a dead life-
saver (imagined, one suspects, from a,
practice at a beach carnival, not seen in
terrible reality) is a subject not for the
profound music of grief, but for a brilliant
epigram, a vivid picture:
Thin brother Death
Has him by the throat
On the sand, in the sun.
And, though the picture is striking, it
is the warm sand and the sun that create
the emotional effect of “Lifesaver.” It
is the same warmth, overriding the
structure of tragedy, that makes the book
as a whole, instead of being either tragic
or gloomy, exceptionally attractive. The
“Sea Captain”— not unlike Kenneth
Slessor’s Captain Dobbin —has not died
in the tragic sense but has “suffered a
sea-change”; and into something rich
and strange enough:
On the north-western shore they buried him,
In the pale coral sand, and soon a vine
Grew out of his conformist heart and bloomed
With purple flowers straying everywhere.
About him cattle roamed, colored as the beach
Where they lay down at noon, and in the night
A black pig rooted there.
Poems, to be bought only from the pub-
lishers, has been beautifully produced.
Decorated by Douglas Annand, and
with a blue morocco binding embellished
with gold, the edition is limited to 350
copies selling at two guineas. Though—
especially as Elizabeth Riddell manages
to be contemporary and comprehensible
at the same time; an act of admirable
charity—one would like to see a cheaper
edition available to the ordinary reader,
her poetry certainly merits this distinctive
production. She has a rare ability to say
exactly what she .wants to say in the
fewest possible words, and what she says
is always—for its style, its color and its
supple and practically faultless technique
—a pleasure to listen to.
The old sailor dreams of a little island
Rolling like an apple in the wide green sea,
A little island he could hold in his hand
Turn over this way and then that
Sot a tree here, and there a nigger in a palm-
leaf hat.
He sailed all his life
Till his blood ran salt as the sea,
His ship was his sweetheart and his wife.
And he passed many an island with no more
Than a glance at the bright white sand of the
curving shore,
But now that the sailor is old
He would like a little island like an apple,
Just to look at and to hold.
Too Many Fairies.
Fairies on the Doorstep, by Dorothy
Sanders (Australasian Publishing Co.), “re-
ceived high praise in the ‘S. M. Herald’
literary competition,” say the publishers,
and was published in the “Herald” as a
serial.
The novel has the virtues of imagina-
tion and a romantic approach to the Aus-
tralian historical background, but both
the imagination and the romanticism
have run wild. A half-caste abori-
ginal girl, sitting naked on a rock, may
conceivably look like “a lone lorelei” —
a lorelei being a siren who haunted a
rock on the right bank of the Rhine, be-
tween Ningen and Coblenz, and by her
beauty and singing enticed sailors to
destruction on the reef below—but she
may, on the other hand, look much more
like a half-caste aboriginal girl.
Even if the simile, in a romantic mood,
could be made justifiable, one would
avoid the facile alliteration. “Like a
dark lorelei” would surely be a much
more effective phrase: though there
would be some difficulty in the fact that
the half-caste in Fairies on the Doorstep,
in moments when the publishers find the
novel “stark,” is reported to be of “a
gleaming candle whiteness” all over. The
girl does not, incidentally, appear to wear
any underclothes except a “shift”;
which, when that garment is tucked
about her waist as she wades the pools
like a lone lorelei, is puzzling.
Almost everyone in Fairies on the
Doorstep is somewhat fey in one
way or another, and none of them is
really convincing. Such rriysteries should
be approached gradually, with the careful
working-up of “atmosphere.” Instead
of trying to fly into the literary world on
a broomstick Miss Sanders would be
wise to see what she can do, first, with
the simple earth below her.
An ex-convict hiding in the Westralian
hills who is stated to be “a hulking mass
of rum-sodden manhood” and who holds
conversations in his mind with the Little
People is a very difficult character to
make plausible. It could be done; but
not, as Miss Sanders tries to do it, simply
by stating that the gentleman sees fairies.
Similarly, it is theoretically possible to
make a kind of Australian Rima out of
a half-caste aboriginal girl, but not
simply by stating that she is mystical and
beautiful.
Fairies on the Doorstep deals with
Irish political prisoners who, among ex-
convicts and horse-thieves, are sheltering
in the Westralian hills until they can be
rescued by an American schooner. It
concludes with an amazing burst of
melodrama in which practically every-
body shoots or spears everybody. It is
probably not more nonsensical than the
average cowboy novel, but Miss Sanders,
one suspects, is capable of something
much better.
Naval officers are as skilled in boat-
work as they are in ship-work—a com-
mon test in a snotty’s seamanship exam,
is to sail a whaler or gig round the Fleet
without a rudder, by working his sails —
and Lt.-Cdr. A. J. Cobham, G.C., R.N.,
in Lee-Oh has produced a guide to the
amateur yachtsman simply enough ex-
pressed for a bullock-driver to follow.
With chapters on everything the harbor-
sailer needs to know, from bending-on
sails and rigging the boat to handling the
tiller and “man overboard,” the little
book should stow in every boat-locker.
A money-order for 2s. posted to the
author in H.M.S. Resource, Portsmouth,
will get it there.

Information Sought.
Some information about the Tatter-
sail family, and its cdnnection with
clubs throughout the English-speaking
world?
Richard Tattersall, a well-known
breeder and owner of racehorses, in
1766 established a racehorse auction
market and subscription rooms on
Hyde Park Corner, London. About
100 years later it was removed to
Knightsbridge, where it formed a
meeting-place for prominent book-
makers and racing men —hence the
general association of the name with
racing matters. Tattersall (known as
Old Tatt) was a famous identity in
his day and owner of the famous
racehorse Highflyer. Tattersalls be-

Story of the Red Hand of Ulster,
as shown on the Ulster flag?
According to legend, the symbol
—an upraised, open, blood-red hand
—originated during an ancient ex-
pedition to Ireland, when it was given
out that whoever first touched the
shore should possess the territory
which he touched. The ancestor of
the O’Neills, seeing another boat
likely to outstrip him, hacked off his
left hand and threw it on to the
coast; his descendants, the princes
of Ulster, having as their symbol the
bloody hand and the motto: “Lamh
dearg Eirin” —Red Hand of Erin.

Who was Beatrice Cenci?
She was the daughter of Francesco
Cenci, a wealthy Roman (1549-98),
and of Lucrezia, his second wife.
Beatrice was involved in a plot to
murder Francesco, who was assassi-
nated while he slept, and after torture
and confession she and her mother
were beheaded in 1599. Shelley’s
poetic tragedy “The Cenci” is histori-
cally inaccurate but has immortalised
Beatrice.

floor ?
Hard paraffin wax, 11b.; powdered
boric acid, 71b.; oil of* lavender, 1
drachm; oil of neroli, 20 minims.
Melt the wax over gentle heat, stir
in the boric acid, then add the per-
fumes. Mix well, and sift through
a very fine sieve to make a Powdery
substance, forcing the mixture through
by rubbing. Sprinkle over the floor
and drag a heavy, soft polisher up

Was there ever a pony express in
connection with the post-offiee in
Australia? . „
Yes. Before the completion (18711
of the overland telegraph line the
gap between the northern and
southern sections was bridged by pony
express. Cable messages were sent
to Port Darwin, then by telegraph to
Daly Waters. Thpnce postal or tele-
graph messengers, mounted on relays
of ponies, galloped to Tennant
Creek, whence the messages were
wired to Adelaide.

tinct from the “inflectional” languages.
The principal agglutinative languages
are the Mongolian, Turkish, Finnish,
Hungarian, North American and the
Dravidian (Tamil and Telugu, etc.)

Whereabouts in Australia is the
tree Thespesia populnea to be found ?
Is it indigenous, and what are its
characteristics and uses?
The tree is indigenous to Australia,
occurring in coastal Queensland and
Northern Australia. It has large
poplar-like leaves and showy flowers.
The fruit contains large quantities of
a yellow viscid juice, which is used
as a dye. The wood resists decay
under water, and is used for boat-
building. The centre portions of old
trunks decay like those of the Euro-
pean elm, and acquire a deep claret
color. The inner bark yields a tough
fibre, which is used for making coffee-
bags; the fine parts of the fibre are
used to make cigar-envelopes.

IN A MODERN KITCHEN
AGA
\ \J
w
IS YOUR SLAVE
Cooking with an jAGA is so easy, so
clean, and so much belter. Day or
night it's ready whenever you want to
use it. AGA burns continuously a
hot oven whenever you need it.
Fuel cost? Incredibly small. AGA's
amazing heat-storage principle enables
it to give maximum efficiency with a bare minimum of fuel
in fact it is the only cooker in the world that is guar-
anted not to burn more than a stipulated quantity (which
varies with each model).
As for kitchen comfort, AGA cookers are scientifically insu-
lated. All outside surfaces (except the hot plates) remain
cool, which means a comfortable room temperature at
all times.
Investigate AGA cooking. Call at any of our branches for
a demonstration, or write for illustrated booklet showing
hoiw AGA cooking will save you time, work and money!

DOG-TAMER
BY JO HN FOUNDTAIN.
f I r HEY reckon,” Butch Carmody
I said, with that wide green-eyed
I earnestness his victims found so
alarming; like the interested
courtesy of a snake. “They reckon,
Jimmy, y’re a great hand with dawgs?”
Butch’s admirers —practically everyone,
that is, except infants and girls—edged
closer, grinning.
“Aw,” Jimmy said, rubbing the
polished toe of his tan shoe into the dis-
guising dust. “I dunno.” But Jimmy
knew; he knew Butch was being funny.
Short of bashing him, he didn’t see how
he could stop him. And — could he bash
Butch?
Jimmy was thinnish, tall for his twelve
years, with mild china-blue eyes and
fair hair inclined upwards and two front
teeth emphatically inclined out. Jimmy
liked dogs. He also hated Butch, and
might have been willing enough to run
the hazard of Mason’s-lane had Butch
been a lesser personality. But Butch —
green-eyed and bandy-legged and mousy-
haired—was a leader and a humorist.
Behind Butch was the Gang, and Public
Opinion, and the crushing power of ridi-
cule.
And then could he bash Butch? They
had fought, once, years before. An
infantile battle, with no one hurt and
both crying, and no decision, for a woman
teacher had rushed out crying stop.
But Butch could fight. He could also
hurl goolies, gibbers and plain bluemetal
with devastating accuracy; could ride
poddy calves; was unexcelled as a
birds’-nest robber. But the roots of his,
power lay deeper.
JIMMY eyed Butch, taking in his
greater breadth, his shorter reach ; his
: mousy-brown hair worn in a fringe and
1 his outsized ears and his hard, compelling
i green eyes. Butch wore trousers which
reached his scarred and soiled knees, sup-
ported by stout police-and-firemen braces,
with a plaited kangaroo-hide belt as a
second string. Butch’s brother, the
drover, gave Butch that belt. Jimmy
looked at it covetously.
“Ocker Crane said y’ve got a new
ferret,” Jimmy said. “He reckons”
“Garn!” Butch disposed of that red-
herring simply. Then, smiling broadly.
“What d’ y’ mean —y’ don’t know? *Y’
must know.”
He knew all right. Jimmy’s blue eyes
wandered helplessly over all the other
grinning faces; lingered on the bell-post
—no help there; fell on Butch’s green
socktops over the cracked, dusty, in-
ordinately heavy boots. Butch wore his
Blucher boots with an air, at once
boisterous, confident, and scornful of
kids who wore shoes; bits of cissies,
Butch’s boots said plainly.
An infant scurried past and Butch
spat on him, a swift sideways movement,
the saliva squirting from between his
teeth, a thread of light in the sun. Jimmy
watched this atrocity unmoved, but what
he saw behind those green eyes was
frightening and confusing. A sort of
sacrilege. Butch was going to drag some-
thing secret out of him, into the harsh
light and the taste of
dust and the smell of
bare feet and jam
sandwiches. Hold it in
his grimy paw, by the
ears as it were, a sort
of rabbit; Jimmy
wished Butch would
shut up; wished the
two of them were
alone, in Mason’s-lane;
wished, almost, that
Butch hadn’t seen him
on Sunday, taking the
Alsatian for a walk.
Almost. But Butch’s
green eyes had opened
wide enough as the
Carmody sulky went past Jimmy and
the big grey Alsatian. If you couldn’t
own an Alsatian it was something to be
seen walking with one.
Jimmy couldn’t own any dog since the
, family dog—a somnambulistic retriever—
-1 had been run over, in the main street, by
a callous stranger. So Jimmy’s mother
had set her face against any other dogs,
and Jimmy, dogless, had concentrated on
other people’s dogs. There wasn’t a dog
in town that he wasn’t on more or less
speaking terms with. If a new dog came
to town he made it his business to get
to know it, And he had several intimate
friends. The Alsatian was one of these,
and Jimmy cherished the sinister hope of
some day matching it with another friend
of his, a bull-terrier round in Brook-
street. Not yet, though. The Alsatian
was too inexperienced. In the meantime
he exercised them both—separately—and
was free with backyards guarded by
cattle-dogs, terriers, staghounds.
And, just to keep his hand in, he
sometimes took Mrs. Palmer’s Pekinese
for a walk, too, He was, glad Butch
hadn’t seen him with the Peke.
THE audience was getting impatient
and. Butch, sensitive to such things,
grinned widely. “How d’ y’ do it,
Jimmy? Charm ’em—like snakes?”
Butch shut his eyes and raised his hands
in extravagant snake-charming gestures.
There were dutiful laughs.
There is something of the buffoon,
perhaps, in all popular leaders. Some-
thing of the artist, too. Butch squatted
on his heels, bent a terrific stare on a
crumpled brown-paper bag, muttered to
himself. Then, waving his open hand
backwards and forwards, he chanted
“Abracadabra kamooza makafoo. Come
’ere an’ I’ll scratch y’r belly for you.”
That was better. They laughed pro-
perly that time.
Then Jimmy’s roving blue eyes saw
relief; a crowd over near the Manual
Shed.
“Looks like a fight,” Jimmy said
eagerly, and ran over.
It wasn’t a fight, although they were all
crowding round, avid and laughing; and
there were satisfying tears, a small curly-
haired boy called Johnny Peters nursing
an injured hand, and crying lustily, and
there was an undercurrent of fear in the
crowd which whipped up excitement mar-
vellously. But the centre of it all was
a small gingery dog, belly crouched to
the ground and tail between its legs,
snarling.
Jimmy pushed through, looked steadily
at the dog.
“Look out,” someone said. “It’s mad.”
But it wasn’t mad ; nearly mad, though,
with fear, green light in its spade-shaped
brown eyes, a crazy phosphorescent
glitter, and whenever anyone stepped to-
wards it it sank lower into the red dust
and the light seemed to shoot out in
short green sparks. Big teeth, but when-
ever the tension eased, for a second, the
red tongue shot out under the sharp
white points, the thin sides heaved. It
was frightened, and very tired. .
“Stand back,” Jimmy said, master-
fully. He walked up to the little ginger
dog, a frilled shadow on the bare, red
ground,
“What’s amatta, boy? Eh, eh?”
The little ginger dog snarled back.
The spaderlike eyes grew hot, flashed.
But there was a little puppy whimper in
the growl. Jimmy stretched out his hand,
the ginger dog snapped. Jimmy sat on
his heels, talking softly,
slowly: “What’s matta,
boy, eh? eh? Fright-
ened, eh? That’s the
trouble! ”
Jimmy said, without
turning his head. “Stop
crowding in! It’s only
frightened. Aren’t y’,
boy, eh, eh?” Slowly
Jimmy stretched out his
hand, slowly, slowly,
talking, his voice
achieving a kind of
canine whine, some-
thing between a nose
and throat sound,
his china - blpe eyes
wide-open, staring straight into the spade
eyes, the green light gone now from the
spade eyes, which were softening to a
deep shining brown. A dog’s eyes, the
eyes of a dog that is going to be fed
and patted and watered and made com-
fortable for the night. - Slowly, slowly,
Jimmy advances his hand, his head fol-
lowing and the tip of his tongue coming
out in his concentration, caressing his big
front teeth.
THEN, with appalling suddenness,
Jimmy is propelled, pushed or kicked,
right on top of the little ginger dog. A
yelp, and the dog, bitterly disillusioned,
bites him on his outflung hand, and
Jimmy, at the pinching pressure, hears
“Y ah! Dog-tamer! ”
It is the unspeakable Butch who has
sneaked up behind him and kicked him
and insulted him and set all his work at
naught. The little ginger dog is running,
silently and desperately, is already into
Mason’s-iane and away and Jimmy, care-
less in his first blind fury of Butch’s
prestige, and the Gang, and Public
Opinion, is chasing him, round the red
sun-baked playground as hard as he can
run.
Round and round, Jimmy’s longer legs
giving him an advantage in the straight,
but Butch uncomfortably agile round
trees, and the bell-post, and doubling
behind the boys’ lavatory. Sucking the
hot dry air in, through the mouth now,
making the throat ache, and strange
thoughts shooting through Jimmy’s' hot
brain. A fleeting doubt about the Gang
—but the Gang, as Gangs sometimes do,
just stands staring. Surprise, mixed with
anger, to see Butch running away from
him so determinedly; and this feeds the
anger, soothes the pride, and Jimmy
screams, as loudly and as fiercely as
breath would allow, “I’ll murder y’, y’
bandy-legged little bastard,” to the de-
light of the Gang, and the giggling
scandal of the Big Girls, and the wonder
of the infants.
To the wonder, too, of Mr. Stone, come
back unexpectedly from “down-town,”
with his pink-cheeked subordinate Mr.
Pepper close behind him.
It is doubtful whether
Mr. Stone was really
surprised. He had been
teaching a long time, and,
as he frequently said —-in
the saloon bar of the
Royal, or in the teachers’
common-room, or in the
slippered domesticity of his
home—he knew boys.
And nothing they did—
certainly nothing of an
offensive or disagreeable
nature could possibly
surprise him.
Surprised or not,
Mr. Stone made a
heavy histrionic display
of it, standing broad and
still at the small silver-
frosted gate near the boys’
lavatory. His long thick lip
clamped up, and his blue
chin following it, a grimace incredibly
vicious-looking. Mr. Stone brought
one big soft well-manicured hairy
hand down on the silver bar of
the gate in a sort of exclamation,
and left it there, and his thick
black eyebrows shot up, then down. Be-
hind his broad grey tweed shoulder was
the pink face of Mr. Pepper, but Mr.
Pepper’s emotions were unimportant. A«
sensitive, kindly soul with no heart for
violence, Mr. Pepper was generally be-
lieved to be a bit of a .dill.
But Mr. Stone, no dill, was standing
at the silver gate like a piece of stone,
broad intimidating granite, with cold
grey eyes that froze movement.
The pepper-tree, near the Manual Shed
thought better of shaking its dusty leaves,
a little dust storm bowling merrily down
from the infants turned suddenly into
abject dust, Jimmy and Butch were
stricken. Jimmy was crouched, as
though a Medusa had caught him at the
start of a sprint, his head was down, fair
hair bristling like a helmet, his blue eyes
squinting sideways, grubby hands droop-
ing. Butch stood with his bandy legs
braced, hands clutching the smooth bell-
post, his head thrown back and his green
eyes wide with a wild alarm.
Over them all, shrieking in the hot
silence, was the echo of Jimmy’s intem-
perate shout.
“I’m surprised,” said Mr. Stone. “Go
to my office —you two. The rest of you,
fall in.” After the awful silence any-
thing was an anticlimax.
“I’m surprised,” said Mr. Stone, again,
in the awful privacy of his office. “Sur-
prised at you, Jimmy, coming from a
good family.”
Jimmy looked a little surprised himself,
and he had a fleeting hope that his family
might save him. But Mr. Stone was
getting his short, dark-yellow, unfairly
heavy cane down from the dusty charts
and maps on the top of his locker. That
cane —The Bruiser. Jimmy decided that
he hated Mr. Stone. He had always
hated him, in fact, but the hatred was
clarified, crystallised in the vision of him-
self and Butch, small and dusty and wet
with sweat, standing before the broad
yellow finely-grained table with the roll-
book neatly marked in red and blue ink
before them, fearfully looking at, and
looking away from, and glancing back
at the thick, short cane in Mr. Stone’s
thick, pink-and-white and black-haired
hand.
MR. STONE stood looking at them,
very sternly. He tapped the cane
lightly against his well-creased grey
trousers, bent his black brows, breathed
in, drawing his dignity and authority in
with the dry hot air. But for his dignity
Mr. Stone would have uncommonly re-
sembled an ape ; a simian with a paunch
gathering under the blue-striped shirt
with the white collar, with a thinness on
top of the brown head of hair and with
a small gold boomerang set in the middle
of the strong square white teeth, and with
a taste for whisky.
“Now,” Mr. Stone said, bending the
cane and bending his mouth to suit.
“What’s all this about? Hey?”
Mr. Stone, after so many years, knew
how to handle boys. As he said, he
stood no nonsense from them. Mr. Stone
was a great believer in standing no non-
sense. Except, perhaps, from girls, Mr.
Stone liked girls. He had, indeed,
fathered one. Although this was a
strange and terrible thing for anyone in
Jimmy’s or Butch’s position to think
about.
“Hey?” shouted Mr, Stone, the little
pink veins in his cheeks and around his
hairy nostrils enlarging and merging be-
fore their fascinated eyes. Mr. Stone
gave them a slap each around the legs,
to wake them up a bit. “Well?”
Butch looked at Jimmy. Jimmy looked
at Butch. “Well” said Jimmy.
“I called him Dog-tamer, Sir,” said
Butch, suddenly deciding to be frank and
fearless about everything, standing up
straight and looking Mr.
Stone in the eye. Mr.
Stone liked boys to look
him unflinchingly in the
eye. Unless, of course,
they did it insolently.
“Dog-tamer, eh?” Mr.
Stone was amused. His
voice, heavy, coming,
surely, from the depths of
a hairy chest, lingered over
the word. “So you dislike
the appellation?”
Jimmy hated him for his
hypocrisy now. Something
he had just remembered.
His mother had said, the
other day, that she had met
Mr. Stone at a card party.
A charming man. That
was what he did, went
round being charming to
parents and bashing into
their kids with whopping
big lumps of wood.
“I don’t like it. Sir,” Jimmy said,
thinking it well to stand up straight and
be frank and manly, too.
“And you expressed your distaste pretty
strongly. In front of the girls.” Mr.
Stone frowned. All amusement died, all
detective interest vanished before the
sharp, abhorrent thought of Jimmy, the
swearer, contaminating girls.
“Hold out, now. No nonsense.” Just
in case Jimmy might be tempted into non-
sense, Mr. Stone gave him a sharp flick
with the cane, under the bony back of
the hand.
Six, three on each hand. And as Jimmy
stumbled to the door, his x hands tucked
under his arms and his eyes smarting,
Mr. Stone called after him, “Now, no
more of that nonsense.”

Girl in the Sun.
When you let down your hair the light
Runs like a golden stream that flows
Into the valley of my sight ;
And when you wear your bridal white —
Gown of the living flesh that glows
Like snow that purifies the rose —
The gold tides of the gardens flood,
The silver of the sun’s delight.
Flow and are held in one white bud.
O Child ! The Flower I cannot grow
—The burning rose and the white snow—
You wear it on your cheek.
The touch of it is on my heart
Softer than ever voice could speak,
And sweetest winds forever blow
You nearer, near —till all my grief
Is sudden joy, a leaf of flame
That Autumn calls who calls my name
Louder than thunder calls the rain
That beats at thought’s dark windowpane.
Glazed With the silver of the sun
See dreaming, where you walk, the air
Crystal on spires and trees which share
The bloom of day with your lit hair.
O, you let down on my despair
Tangles of shade and light that seem
The distant reaches of a dream
That floats on sleep’s most happy stream.
QUEENSLAND.

POLL-AXED PROPHETS.
Enter some Prophets, clad in
motley;
George Van Slyke (N. Y.
“Sun”): “Gov. Thomas E.
Dewey tomorrow will be elected
thirty-third President of the
United States.”
Walter Winchell (N. Y.
“Daily Mirror”): “Truman’s
friends are trying to get him
elected. If they were real friends
they’d be trying to find him an
apartment.”
David Lawrence (N. Y.
“Sun”): “Gov. Dewey will be
elected by a substantial majority
in the Electoral College. He is
assured of a minimum of 266 —
necessary for ejection—and his
majority will range from 75 to
100.”
Joseph and Stewart Alsop
(Washington “Post”): “The
tragedy of Truman is simply
that, despite the best of inten-
tions, his capacity for growth is
sharply limited, and the voters
have sensed as much.”
Walter Lippmann (N. Y.
“Herald Tribune”): “The posi-
tion, after Mr. Dewey’s election,
will be,” etc.
Philip GeyeUh (“Wall-street
Journal”): “Government will re-
main big, active and expensive
under President Thomas E.
Dewey.”
Frederick C. Othman (N. Y.
“World-Telegram”): “The bal-
lots haven’t been counted at this
writing [on election-morning],
but I see no further need for
holding up an affectionate fare-
well to Harry Truman.... .Oddly
enough, there has been not one
hint about what he intends to do
in January. One thing’s certain:
he’ll have to go out and earn
his living. He’ll enjoy that, too.
And I have no doubt that after
a hiatus of nearly four years,
it’ll be his pleasure to dry the
dishes again for his beloved
Bess.”
Drew Pearson (Washington
syndicated column): “....Tom
Dewey, who will take over the
White House 86 days from
now.”
George Rothwell Brown
(N. Y. “journal-American”):
“Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of
New York will ride triumphantly
White Houseward today [elec-
tion-day] amid the crumbling
ruins of that coalition of hum-
bug and chicanery known as the
Roosevelt New Deal, which for
16 years by trickery and deceit
undermined many of the noblest
traditions of American political
and social life.”
“Chicago “Tribune” (leading
article): “Mr. Truman is a gone
goose, and everyone knows it.”
Dr. George Gallup (of the
Gallup Poll, predicting on the
Friday before election-day that
Dewey would win 31 States and
the Presidency): “Next Tuesday
the whole world will be able
see down to the last percentage
point how good we are.”
Exit Prophets in endless pro-
cession, clad in sackcloth, hav-
ing, like a famous bird of pas-
sage, changed plumage in mid-
flight.
Somewhere amongst them
would be the makers of a movie
in which the spoken line of a
character referring to Presidents
“From McKinley to Truman”
was changed in production to
“From McKinley to Dewey.”
The film was showing in New
York and getting a great laugh
on election-night.
Also in the procession would
be the chap who wisecracked on
Truman’s election - morning
breakfast, “The condemned man
ate a hearty meal.”
About the best wisecrack
noted on the pollsters was Ed
Sullivan’s in N. .Y. “Daily
News”: “Gov. Dewey won in a
Gallup and President Truman
won in a walk.” Of the pollsters
— N. Y. “Daily Mirror."
“PROPS! PROPS! CHEAP TODAY, FOLK!”
themselves, one of the most re-
putable, Elmo Roper, spoke in
effect for the lot: “I could not
have been more wrong;.. .The
thing that bothers me most at
this moment is that I don’t
know why I was wrong.”
Among the scribes—including
such good ones as James Reston,
of N. Y. “Times” and many
others of his ability—there was
an unkind rush to blame the
pollsters for leading them all
astray. One gathers that, if the
polls had them, they have defi-
nitely had the polls.
N. Y. “Daily Mirror” leader-
column can be called on for a
few tender parting words: “As
a footnote, won’t it be nice to
be relieved of the polls for a
while? The polls managed to
make Harry Truman’s strength
the best-kept secret of U.S.
political history. The polls, we
think, have invaded too much
of our lives. On any subject
from sex to social security poll-
takers go here and there gather-
ing ‘samples’ of ‘public opinion’
across the nation. ‘Fooey,’ we
say. ‘Nuts! ’ ”
Atom, and Worse.
A widely-circulated U.S. State
Department publication gives
the substance of seven speeches
by Frederick H. Osborn, deputy
American delegate to the
U.N.O. Atomic Energy Com-
mission, asserting that a basic
change in Soviet principles and
the “iron-curtain” system will
be necessary before there can be
any international control of
atomic energy.
Osborn has the hope that “At
some not too distant time the
Soviet Union may find that arm-
ing against all the rest of the
world is too heavy a load. At
that time it may be prepared to
modify its attitude so as to be
rid of the burden. It might then
be willing to raise the ‘iron
curtain.’ ”
He argues that “Acceptance
of atomic control would make
possible agreement on the re-
duction and control of other
arms which would rapidly fol-
low. The new spirit of co-
operation and openness* result-
ing from such agreements would
be the best safeguard against the
possibility of preparation for
biological warfare.”
However, “The men who rule
Russia must be to a great extent
the slaves of a system which
comprises, first of all, the ‘iron
curtain’ which prevents the free
circulation in the Soviet Union
of news of the outside world
and encourages bias in the re-
ports of the Government agents ;
second, centralised controlled
propaganda to mould public
opinion within the country, and,
finally, the firm policy which
prevents all free expression of
dissenting public opinion, and
the Siberian forced-labor camps
for those who raise embarras-
sing questions.”
Hence there is no likelihood
of a change in the official Soviet
attitude: “For the present at
least the Soviet Union would
rather run the risk of leaving a
preponderant strength in this
weapon in the hands of others
than risk opening up the
Soviet Union to the extent re-
quired by any real system of in-
ternational control.”
Nothing much, apparently,
can be done about it, short of
the “iron curtain” being raised
“so that there can develop in the
Soviet Union some informed
and effective public opinion.”
Meanwhile, Osborn concludes,
“It is our task to break this
chain of ignorance which
threatens the world with a new
and greater catastrophe. It is
the task of free speech, of a free
press, of a free radio ; opposing
speech that is muzzled, a press
that is controlled, a radio turned
to propaganda.”
Dismantling Protests.
Germans in the Western zone
protesting against the wholesale
dismantling of their industrial
plants are receiving support
from sources as widely divergent
as London “Times” and Chicago
“Tribune.”
At Mulheim, the “Times” has
reported, German workers
prevented the removal of a
large radial-drum rolling mill.
One small mill had already been
dismantled and the larger one
was next, but when the special
squads arrived for the job
several hundred workers from
other shops throughout the
works downed tools and stood
in front of the mill in protest.
The squads left. At Essen the
Mayor “told the British Under-
secretary of the feeling of un-
certainty and anxiety for the
future that hung over the entire
town and urged the need for an
early decision by the Military
Government on the little that
now remains of the vast Krupps
concern.”
Chicago “Tribune” declares
that its Washington correspon-
dent has unearthed a “secret,
suppressed report,” according to
which “the entire multi-billion
dollar Marshall Plan to halt the
spread of Communism in Wes-
tern Europe is being endangered
by the dismantling of the Ger-
man steel industry.” Attribut-
ing the “relentless destruction”
to the desire of the British to
capture Germany’s pre-wan in-
dustry, the report —or the “Tri-
bune” —alleges, with a touch of
optimism, that although “every
German” is ready and willing to
make extensive reparations and
to do hard work for the recon-
struction of Europe, they will
not have much chance »if the
tools for the job are destroyed.
“Robbery” by the British and
American authorities who “are
simply setting out to destroy a
great commercial rival of the
big chemical firms in their own
countries” is the “Tribune’s”
version of the LG. Farben
chemical-works dismantling.
Considering the same prob-
lem —“the reparations folly”
under the two headings of the
destruction of outright muni-
tions plants and the removal of
“surplus,” “Wall-street Journal”
points out that German industry,
like any other, “is a highly com-
plicated and integrated machine,
the removal of any minor part
of which renders a great deal of
the remainder useless... . The
distinction between ‘war plants’
and other industrial equipment
cannot be applied to much of
any country’s industry. Most
industrial equipment can be
applied to the uses of war or
peace.”
Expressing the commonly-
held U.S. view—except by out-
right isolationists who believe
that Europe should be left to
stew in its own juice and con-
template the evil fruits of war —
“Wall-street Journal” concludes
that, as the first year of the
Marshall Plan “contemplates
assigning 364 million dollars to
the American and British occu-
pation zones and, 100 million
dollars to the French to rebuild
the economy of Western Ger-
many and render the inhabitants
thereof self-supporting as soon
as possible,” it is outright folly
“to be pouring food, raw
materials and industrial equip-
ment into Western Germany
while German industry, by
which alone the Germans can
hope to support themselves, is
being torn to pieces and applied
•at scrap values to the repara-
tion claims of our gallant allies.”
Socialism Second.
In a dispatch to N, Y.
“Times” from London Michael
L. Hoffman reports on a British
Government decision, revealed
in Manchester “Guardian,” to
curtail expenditures on social-
improvement and betterment
projects when such outlays in-
terfere with Britain’s ability to
become independent of dollar
aid.
By this decision Britain “has
demonstrated in a concrete way,
for the first time, that she recog-
nises that her need to pay her
way internationally must take
precedence, if necessary, over
some of the Socialist party’s
favorite programmes.”
The undertaking is declared to
be part of Britain’s four-year
economic programme submitted
to the organisation for European
Economic Co-operation in Paris.
Correlated with the programmes
of the other European countries,
it will be Britain’s answer to the
question directed to all partici-
pants in the European Recovery
Programme: “What are you in-
tending to do to be self-sufficient
by 1952?”
“Though few Britons realise
it* yet,” the correspondent com-
ments, “this will be a commit-
ment to Western Europe, and
indirectly to the United States,
that will override British in-
ternal policies in numerous
respects, some of which, such as
a limitation on expanded social
services, are politically explo-
sive.
“Conflicts between such pro-
grammes as socialised medicine
and public housing arise when
domestic investment uses up
materials and equipment that
otherwise would be exported.
This is a tremendous step for
the Socialist Government to
take.”
The Manchester “Guardian”
report, regarded as authoritative,
stated that, in this programme,
£500,000,000 is fo be invested in
Britain’s agriculture, leading to,
among other results, a rise in
production of bread-grains of
some 60 per cent, above last
year’s figure.
In almost all basic foods ex-
cept meat and potatoes, sizeable
increases are planned. “These

agricultural plans,” the N. Y.
“Times” man comments, “are
likely to be questioned closely
by the United States and re-
covery - programme economists
who may ask whether better re-
sults could not be achieved by a
much smaller investment in the
relatively undeveloped parts of
the world.”
Other striking features re-
ported include the British inten-
tion to become nearly self-suffi-
cient in chemicals and to raise
petroleum-refinery capacity by
450 per cent.
The China Sell-out.
The onward sweep of the
Soviet-backed forces in China
has stirred up a rare old storm
of American press criticism,
ranging from regretful to savage
and directed at U.S, war-time
and peace-time policy, with
Roosevelt and Marshall cast for
leading roles in the pillory.
Most main points of the criti-
cism are ammunition in a sus-
tained barrage launched by
Scripps-Howard writer Parker
La Moore, whose review of the
policy and its fruits is described
•by N, Y. “World-Telegram” as
'‘not a history of which any
American can be proud.”
, The story traces the deteriora-
tion of China’s position “as a
war-time partner, co-equal with
the Soviet Union, Britain and
the U.S.” from 1945, at
Yalta, where “behind Chiang
Kai-shek’s back Roosevelt and
Churchill agreed to Stalin’s de-
mands for vital concessions to
the Soviets at China’s expense.”
Those concessions, Russia’s
price for joining in the war
against Japan, included estab-
lishment of a Russian naval
base at Forth Arthur and Rus-
sian management of commercial
port facilities at Dairen, both in
Chinese Manchuria, as well as
other considerations,
“The United States pressured
China into ratifying this agree-
ment in a Chinese-Russian
treaty signed at Moscow later
that year. In return for extra-
territorial privileges in Man-
churia, the Soviets pledged their
exclusive military and economic
support to Chiang’s Govern-
ment. But when Russia failed
to keep her part of the deal the
U.S. did nothing about it.
“The next blow fell when
Maj.-Gen. Patrick J, Hurley re-
signed as Ambassador to China,
charging that American interests 1
in the Far East were being sabo-
taged by Communist sympa-
thisers in the [U.S.] State Depart-
ment. Thereafter the anti-Chiang
forces in the department moved
into full control of American
policy. They had the support
of the American Communist
party. Less than a month after
General Hurley’s resignation
William Z. Foster, national
chairman of the Communist
party, in a statement to his
national committee, said the civil
war in China held the key to all
problems of the international
front.”
Thereafter the U.S. “drifted
into a position of virtual
neutrality” between Chiang Kai-
shek’s Government and the
Chinese Communists, finally de-
serting Chiang when Marshall
took over U.S. policy in China.
As a war-time measure, the
U.S, had tried to bring about a
coalition of the Nationalist and
Communist armies in China for
an all-out effort against Japan.
“President Truman continued
this as a basic American policy
after the war, when the project
had lost its original meaning.
General of Army Marshall, who
succeeded General Hurley as the
President’s representative in
China, conditioned further
American assistance upon the
formation of a fusion Govern-
ment in which the Communists
would be represented. This put
the Communists in a position to
stop U.S. financial assistance to
Chiang simply by breaking off
the negotiations which they
promptly did.”
When the Communists broke
off discussions with the
Nationalist Government (La
Moore’s interesting account pro-
ceeds) the U.S. not only sus-
pended a $500,000,000 Export-
Import Bank loan earmarked for
China, but also plgced an em-
bargo against the shipment of
arms to Chiang’s hard-pressed
forces, in which situation “the
initiative in the civil war passed
to the Communists, for their
armies were receiving abundant
supplies from the Japanese
equipment which the Russians
— N. Y. "Herald Tribune.”
“SO-LONG, BOYS. GOOD LUCK!”
had seized when they moved
into Manchuria.”
Next steps in the U.S. policy
for China were the suspending,
then the cancelling, , of the
$500,000,000 Export - Import
Bank loan to Chiang’s Govern-
ment, since when “U.S. assist-
ance to China, a war-time ally,
has been less than that which it
has given to any of the late
enemy States of Germany, Italy
and Japan.” Further, the U.S.
continued to insist on a Com-
munist coalition in China even
after it had begun to finance the
war against Communism in
Greece.
As far back as April the U.S.
Congress voted $420,000,000 for
economic and military assistance
to Chiang, but, La Moore de-
clares, up to now “not a rifle or
a bullet has arrived in China,
and China’s forces are in re-
treat all along the line for want
of weapons and ammunition,”
The Scripps-Howard writer
adds that “A hush-hush policy
has attended most of America’s
official relations with China since
1945. Last year Lt.-Gen. A. C.
Wedemeyer, commander of the
China theatre during the war,
was sent to that country to in-
vestigate the situation. On his
return his report was suppressed
by President Truman, and it
never has been made public, but
it is understood that it was a
devastating indictment of State
Department policy.”
N. Y. “World - Telegram”
editorially sums up on the fore-
going that “Future historians
will ponder long on how Presi-
dent Truman and Secretary Mar-
shall, who acted realistically and
courageously to halt the spread
of Communism in Europe and
the Middle East, could have
been so blind to the same threat
in the larger theatre of the Far
East.”
It would seem that that Tru-
man failure did not carry much
weight with the Presidential
electors, since the China sector
of U.S. foreign policy was
specially singled out for attack
by Dewey, one of his remark-
ably few points of difference in
that sphere.
“I believe,” said Dewey, “the
[Truman] Administration has
been niggardly and faltering and
inconsistent and blundering to
the point of tragedy in the
failure to adopt a realistic pro-,
gramme to save China from the
Communists. I am firmly con-
vinced .... that we must adopt a
realistic programme that the
leaders of the Chinese Govern-
ment need, and increase our con-
fidence to those willing to fight
with us shoulder to shoulder
.... As we take action to save
the 275,000,000 people of Europe
for the free world, it is the
sheerest folly to abandon
450,000,000 people in China, If
China falls we may reasonably
assume that all Asia is gone, and
Western Europe and the
Americas will stand alone—
very much alone in a hostile
world.
“Next to the Monroe Doc-
trine,” Dewey further stated,
“our policy of the open-door
and the political integrity of the
Chinese Republic is the oldest
and most fundamental part of
the foreign policy of the Gov-
ernment of the United States
.... There must be some basic
importance to a policy so deeply
rooted in the history of our
country.”
“U.S. News and World Re-
port” sees a Communist Asia
looming up, with U.S. prestige
and influence there plainly “on
the skids.” It finds that “the
United States and the West are
losing the ‘cold war’ in Asia by
default,” and blames “failure of
America and the other Western
Powers to shape a positive policy
towards the Orient” as the prin-
cipal factor behind the Com-
munist gains;
“Agitators are making pro-
gress with stories of American
aid to Japan, while aid on a
large scale is denied to areas
that earlier had been overrun by
the Japanese. They are making
headway, too, with stories of
American aid to France, Britain,
Holland, some of which is
allotted for use in resisting
native movements for independ-
ence.
“Agitation, coupled with
grinding poverty, unrest among
peasants, a stirring nationalism,
combine to provide a fertile field
for Communist cultivation.
Russia is facilitating this Com-
munist offensive by pursuing a
course calculated to win friends
and influence a billion restless
people. Native movements are
championed, aid of many kinds
is promised by Russia, while the
U.S., because of commitments
in Europe, is giving support to
the colonial Powers.”
The Manila “Chronicle” has
editorially commented on the
favoring of Japan: “The Philip-
pines cannot but view with ap-
prehension the growing senti-
ment among American officials
to render the lot of Japan more
enviable than that of her vic-
tims.” Also, the Indian “News
Chronicle” has expressed the
view of most Indian leaders:
“To people in this country,
where great difficulties are still
being experienced in procuring
capital aid from the U.S.A. for
India’s economic development,
it must look strange that even
erstwhile enemies [the Japanese]
are preferred to war-time allies
in the matter of dollar aid.”
The present prevailing view
in America might be summed
up as a feeling that the U.S.
could not, under any policy,
have blocked the Communist
spread in both Europe and
Asia, and that the wisest and
safest course now is to go on
bolstering Europe and let main-
land Asia slide.
How War Might Come.
Though the view that war is
not imminent continues to
spread in the U,S., fear of
eventual war remains just as
widespread.
One way in which it could
come about is examined by a
“Wall-street Journal” staff cor-
respondent :
‘ As the U.S.-Europe combina-
tion gets stronger, militarily and
economically, the West will
gradually strengthen its stand
toward Russian control over
non-Russian peoples. At some
point along this line, the U.S.-
Europe team will stop backing
down to Russia—begin the long-
deferred ‘get - tough’ policy.
Then, officials believe, the U.S.
and Europe will stop Russian
expansion in Europe in its tracks,
perhaps even bring some pres-
sure against Soviet control over
some of its European satellites.
“It’s then, when the Russian
Bear is stopped flatly in Europe,
and even thrown back a little on
its haunches, that the danger of
war will come. Though Russia
isn’t ready for war, the Kremlin
might take a chance, fight to
‘break out’ when it’s stopped.
“When will this come? In a
personal conversation, one State
Department official said: ‘I think
the danger-point of war will
come in two to five years.’ ”
However, the writer adds that,
though U.S. State Department
experts expect a “super-duper”
crisis then, they believe the odds
would still be against a war. He
quotes one of them: “The
Russians have always shown
themselves realistic when
they’re up against something
strong;”

Gallup in Britain. —After the recent
hilarious American experience,
Britain’s Conservative-party members
and prospectives may view as more
ominous than promising the London
“Times” editorial comment that “Both
the political soothsayers and the
Gallup polls promise them success
in 1950.” At least, the Conservatives
have a likely-sounding slogan; “Set
the people free.”

Portrait ,in Purple. —Recent cameo
done by a Scripps-Howard represen-
tative at the U.N.O. comic uproar in
Paris: “In his fury, Mr. Vyshinsky
thundered and at times screamed. He

down in his chair, pointed his finger,
called names and got purple in the
face.” And, alas, got nowhere.

U.S. of Britain. —While everybody’s
hard at it on this metamorphosis of
the poor old Empire into something
strange and unpronounceable, the
suggestion is made in a Canadian
daily, the Ottawa “Citizen,” that they
might go the whole hog and contrive
a British United States: .“The civi-
lised world could be given a new
vision of the possibilities of com-
monwealth —with no more barriers to
trade, nor passports to travel, than
there are between the States of the
American union; with a common
currency and co-operative credit
power; with something more than a
waning sentiment to draw people
closer together for mutual aid and
benefit.”

J.B. Helps the Displaced. —A Yugo-
slav, Milivoje B. Gavrilovic, general
secretary of the welfare committee
looking after his displaced country-
men, has put it on record in Lon-
don “Times” that Britain has done
more in absorbing the displaced than
any other country. J. Bull has already
given jobs in British industry to no
fewer than 70,000 of them, apart
from an also very large number em-
ployed in the British zone in Ger-
many. If other countries did anything
like as much as Britain, the Yugo-
slav adds, there’d soon be no dis-
placed problem. Incidentally, it is
just one of the many incalculable
elements still keeping J.B. at the top
of the world in prestige.

The Worthless Word. —The very
black nigger in the woodpile at
U.N.0., as seen there by Scripps-
Howard foreign editor William Philip
Simms: “Deep down, everyone is
asking ‘Even if a miracle happens
and there is an agreement over Berlin,
how long would .the Kremlin honor
its word?’ The tragedy of the
situation is that nobody here feels
that he can take Russia’s word for
anything. This is unprecedented in
modern intdrnational relations, especi-
ally in dealings among the great
Powers.” Perhaps not altogether un-
precedented—Hitler’s word, too, got
a bit rocky—but in other respects an
exact enough diagnosis.
* * * *
Snooping Made Easy. —“lf Russia
hasn’t got the atomic-bomb secret,”
Dave Boone comments in N. Y.
“Sun” on the U.S. spy disclosures,
“it doesn’t seem to be because her
snoopers didn’t have it pretty easy
over here. They had everything but
a motor-cycle escort.”
* * * *
Britain’s Stake With Arabs. —The
failure of the Arab armies to over-
throw the new State of Israel is (in
the view of Brigadier Glubb, put
forward in a London “Times” letter)
no reason for concluding that Britain
“has backed the wrong horse”: “It
is not the armies of the Arabs or of
Israel which are important—it is the
geographical situation of their terri-
tories. The Arab countries lie across
the main line of communications from
west to east. They also form the
only land bridge between Asia and
Africa. They contain vast reserves
of oil. An alliance with Israel, how-
ever efficient that State may be, would
not compensate Britain for the loss
of Arab friendship.. Strategy is built
primarily on the inescapable facts of
geography.”

A TEST IN VICTORIA.
“Russia has already begun World War
111 with the Berlin blockade,” said the
Victorian Premier on his return from
overseas. Mr.“Hollway was speaking
from Melbourne, the scene of a challenge
by Communist union bosses to the
authority of his Government. He pro-
ceeded ;
The technique is the same throughout
the world as in Victoria. Russia is de-
liberately sabotaging shipping, and general
transport hold-ups and lightning strikes
to bring about a state of industrial
chaos.
There is the same relationship between
the shipping blockade ordered in
Victoria and that of the London dock
strike last June and lately on the American
eastern and western coasts as between
the disastrous coal strike in France and
that attempted the other day in N. S.
Wales. Industrial disputes between private
employers and employees have nothing
to do with these stoppages. Employers in
most instances are Governments or Gov-
ernment agencies ; the rank and file of the
workers are instructed by union execu-
tives, often under one-man control, to
strike regardless of their own sentiments.
The parallel with the carrying-on of
war "is seen in the language of operation
orders by the local Communist high
command, and in the open arid insolent
proclamation by these rebel leaders of
their airti as being the overthrow of con-
stituted Governments. In these circum-
stances defiance of the law, serious as
that is, becomes an incidental detail.
Witness these declarations by Communist
union-leaders on the Victorian situation;
W. Bird, secretary Seamen’s Union Vic-
torian branch: “The effort is not only to
urge that the Act be repealed, but to pripple
and ruin the Hollway-McDonald Govern-
ment for all time.”
The same, in a letter to the Victorian
Premier: “If your Cabinet continues with
its proposed action [to proclaim the Act
as a deterrent to lightning strikes against
the community], the Federal executive of
our union will immediately declare a com-
plete blockade on all Victorian ports.”
E. V. Elliott, Seamen’s general secretary:
“If the Victorian Government is foolish
enough to take action [to assert its
authority] my union has already decided,
in March last, that it will impose an
absolute blockade on all Victorian ports.”
B. Flanagan, Victorian Ironworkers: “It
is time to have a showdown with the Gov-
ernment. The legislation [passed by over-
whelming majority in Parliament on the
morrow of an election campaign fought on
this issue] caniipt be tolerated,”
I. Williams, * Coalminers’ Federation:
“The Federation will support Victorian
unions’ opposition to this legislation. We
are committed to take whatever steps are
necessary to defeat the Victorian Govern-
ment.”
J. Healy, general secretary, Watersiders’
Federation: “The Federation will use all
its resources to take industrial action
if the Victorian Government prosecutes
any of its members under the Essential
Services Act.”
With the A.C.T.U. trying to hold the
unions back from reckless action—for
the industrial split over Communism is
now being tested, too —the Communist
action was relegated to the Seamen’s
bosses, who can, of course, throw Vic-
toria into disorder by the banning of
shipping. The Victorian Government
promptly replied with a proclamation
against the' Seamen’s Union under the
Act. With all transport and industry about
to shut down in the State the A.C.T.U,
came to a settlement at the week-end
with only Seamen’s Commissar Elliott,
uttering continued violence from beyond
Victorian police jurisdiction, rejecting the
terms for calling off the strike.
The issue moved away from the
threat raised by the summonses issued
against 10 railway and tramway officials
concerned in the one-day stoppage a
fortnight ago when the Victorian Premier
announced an amending bill to allow
action against certain “principal strike-
leaders” who hold power in the unions
as salaried officials. It was no part of
the Victorian Government’s purpose that
the real strike-inciters, the Communist
bosses who are waging Russia’s “cold
war,” should escape, and the Hollway
Government should seal up that hole
against the future.
These leaders of industrial rebellion,
planned as a forerunner to revolutionary
civil conflict, are all directed, as Com-
munist Thornton has boasted, by the local
Soviet at Marx House, in Sydney.
Throughout this year they have been test-
ing their power over the unions for a trial
ot strength—cm the coalfields, on the
wharves and railways, in gasworks, metal
shops and engine houses—in New Zealand,
in Queensland, in N.S.W., and now, for
the second time, in Victoria, Their first
combined effort in Australia was recog-
nised in the transport hold-up 12 months
ago in Victoria which destroyed the
Cain Government at the elections. The
same Communist Brown of the Victorian
railways, who bought his union a part in
the 1947 tramway strike in Melbourne
against the Cain Government, and had
the impudence to issue “permits” for
buses to run on the streets, was heard
reiterating the threats he originally de-
livered against the .emergency legislation
at the time when the Hollway Govern-
ment enacted it. He and his fellow-Com-
munists proved lily-livered then, and they
wei% concerned only to save their skins
last week.
The Victorian elections revealed the
public’s wholehearted support for firm
action, and the Geelong by-election the
other day was a vote to stiffen the Holl-
way Government’s resolution. So is the
signal defeat of Communist candidates
for offices on the Melbourne Tramways
Union executive. What happened to the
Cain Government is a forecast of the fate
awaiting cowardly “Labor” politicals
everywhere else, notably in N. S. Wales
and in Canberra, as soon as the popular
voice can pronounce judgment.
Mr, Oldham, the Victorian Attorney-
General, has stated clearly the issue and
the action to which his Government is
committed —to which any Government
that deserves the name must be com-
mitted. “We shall uphold the law, and
it is our intention, come what may, to
see that the law is enforced.” The State’s
own public services were, at behest of
leaders ready to make themselves out-
laws, being laid idle in order to over-
throw law and the Government together.
And the occasion of this insurgence was
the enforcement of a statute enacted
by a Parliament elected expressly to do
that very thing—a law of which good
notice was given that it would be en-
forced against any further lightning strike
in the State’s essential services. The gas-
who shut down his furnace in
order to discuss a political pamphlet
with other hands started this trouble, but
any small incident would have done so.
Mr. Oldham has also explained that
the Act does not deny unionists “the
right to strike,’’ but merely requires them
first to vote on a strike issue by secret
ballot —instead of being ordered out by
those whom Mr. Hanlon, of Queens-
land, calls “the mimicking Molotovs”
which “Labor” has fostered in this coun-
try. Mr. Oldham might have said some-
thing more—something which is inherent,
too, in Socialist, and especially in Com-
munist, doctrine. That is, that in essen-
tial public services, run by the Govern-
ment as employers on behalf of the whole
community—services on which all other
employment directly depends, and where
a strike defies both arbitral tribunals and
the Government itself —there cannot be
permitted any unconditional “right to
strike.” And, in fact, in the Communists’
own homeland there is none.
For the time being the Soviet fifth-
column in Australia is defeated again,
partly by the efforts of a Government
which is determined to govern, and partly
by non-Communist trade-unions and
Trades Hall executives who, while pre-
tending to resent the Victorian Emer-
gency Services Act, are really well
pleased to find a Cabinet and Parlia-
ment ready to reinforce their own
domestic struggle to oust Communist in-
fluence from their organisations. The
Melbourne trammies’ ballot for their
union officials is a clear sign on that point.
The great majority of Australians, whose
sentiments are with them, will look to
the Hollway Government to hammer out
its amending legislation while the iron
is hot.
Another Let-down.
His disastrous attempt at mediation be-
tween the Powers in the dispute over
Berlin should be Dr. Eyatt’s swan-song
as a diplomat and as an Australian repre-
sentative abroad. Any Government which
valued its reputation either for consist-
ency or commonsense would dismiss him
at once, but the Chifley Government
cares nothing for consistency, it being far
more concerned for the feelings of the
Communist-led unions which dominate
the A.L.P. and are in some cases part of
it,; and commonsense is a commodity
with which it long ago has dispensed.
The reason which suggests Dr. Evatt’s
dismissal is not that he and his Russian-
nominated U.N.O. secretary, Mr. Lie,
have failed in what they have attempted
to do. It is that they have acted in such
a way as to condemn publicly all parties
to the dispute equally, and to imply an
accusation against the Western Powers
that they have not been doing their best
to clean up a desperate mess of which the
outcome might easily be a third world
war.
They have interfered in a manner which
undoubtedly must encourage Russia’s
aggression, and which tends to weaken
the authority of the Western Powers in
Europe, including that of Australia.
For Mr. Lie’s behavior in the Berlin
dispute some excuse might be found in
that he is outside the arena. But for
Dr, Evatt there can be none. In his
position as the External Affairs Minister
of Australia there can be only one of
two views of his position, and neither of
them produces any feeling of admiration
either for his ethical outlook or his mental
equipment. If Australia is still part of
the British Commonwealth it is a party to
the dispute, and Dr. Evatt’s stand is
tantamount to the surrender of a section
of the British people to the politics of flag-
rant aggression. And if Australia is not
a party, then it must have withdrawn from
the British Commonwealth, and the with-
drawing must have been done privately by
Dr. Evatt and in defiance of the stand of
the Commonwealth Government, whose
leaders were so busy last week with
assurances that we still sail as part of the
British comity of nations.
There can be no misunderstanding
about what happened in Berlin. Follow-
ing long and careful preparation, the
Russians attempted to take over the city
virtually by violence as a preliminary to
doing the same in their own good time
with the rest of Germany and Western
Europe,
Their crucial moves were openly
aggressive. Having failed tp remove a
properly elected and legal city Govern-
ment and to drive the Allied liaison out
of the City Hall by harassing tactics,
Russians, on Sep. 6, forcibly broke into
the rooms of the American liaison officer
in the hall and ordered out U.S. officers,
who were told also to remove German
police there on their lawful business of
protecting the premises and its inmates
against Communist mobs. The Russians
proceeded in the same way with the
French and British (which was also the
Australian) liaison offices. The follow-
ing night the offices of the U.S., French
and British were broken into and
searched. Communist mobs transported
in Soviet military vehicles broke the
windows of the City Hall and battered
their way into its interior under the spon-
sorship and protection of armed Soviet
military police. The “Information Bul-
letin,” magazine of the U.S. Military
Government in Germany, in its October
issue says:
A Soviet officer and a dozen soldiers
bearing tommy-guns were present when the
attack was made on the U.S. liaison office.
U.S., French and British Military Gov-
ernments were insulted and abused in par-
ticular. Plainclothes policemen [in the
office] were seized and manacled and
carried away under protest from the U.S.,
British and French representatives.
And all this was coupled with a
blockade of Western Berlin with a view
to driving out the British, Australians and
Americans by the manipulation of cur-
rency and closing of normal communica-
tion routes which are now being kept
open only at tremendous expense to the
Allied taxpayers, including the Australian
taxpayers —who indirectly are providing
part of the cost, and are responsible for
risking the lives of a large number of
R.A.A.F. personnel to maintain their legal
rights and those of the people of Berlin.
There has been no disinclination on the
part of the Western Powers to negotiate.
They actually did negotiate on the highest
level with Messrs. Stalin and Molotov
in Moscow for a whole month in August,
after having obtained access to them only
with the greatest difficulty. They more-
over came to an agreement which was
at once repudiated by the Russians, the
repudiation being followed by the acts of
violence already related. Britain and the
United States are still open to negotia-
tion, but only negotiation upon the whole
of the issues, whereas Russia will agree
to negotiate only if allowed to maintain
the present status quo and keep the spoils
which give her virtually all the Kremlin
needs for the moment.
In these circumstances Dr. Evatt’s in-
terference seems to be the last act in a
long series which makes it impossible for
him to continue in office as Minister for
External Affairs if this country is to re-
tain a shred of its national self-respect
and the confidence of its friends and allies.
Wherever an issue arises between
friends and foes Dr. Evatt is, astonish-
ingly often, to be found on the
side opposed to those who have stood
with us loyally. He was with the
Indians against white South Africa, whose
naval bases, resources and wealth played,
at one stage, almost a determining part
in the security of our western shores. In
Tokyo his policy sides with Russia,
a Power which was the friend and sup-
plier of Japan until a few days before
victory, while he opposes that of the
United States, to which his Ministry six
years ago was shrieking for 25 divisions
—of conscripts—to defend Australia.
In Indonesia he deserted the loyal
Dutch, desperately assailed by a rebel
Government largely made up of Japanese
collaborators.
In Europe, Dr. Evatt’s recent cry to
save the Greek Communist traitors sen-
tenced to death was heard to the ends
of the earth, but nobody so far has heard
a demand by him that the lives of about
a dozen Polish socialists, who have been
brutally sentenced for political offences
against a Communist regime dominated
by Moscow, should be saved. And though
he is a hater of aggression, and so
allegedly is his Prime Minister, there has
been no recent outcry against Communist
aggression in China, and everything pos-
sible has been done in Canberra to palli-
ate the horror-stricken public view of the
murderers of Australian and British
civilians by bloodstained foreign Chinese
terrorists in Malaya.
It is no wonder that Dr. Evatt is losing
friends. Even the admiring “Sydney
Morning Herald” has deserted him and
his U.N.0., of which it was an ardent
supporter, but which it now describes “as
a greater sham than the League of
Nations, its name a mockery.”
A country which professes to follow
British traditions of loyalty and fair play
cannot afford him and his apostasies and
disloyalties, more especially since it has
been long evident that he has been actu-
ated in many of them by a desire to
promote his own advertisement rather
than the Allied interests.
On an Anniversary.
Anniversaries being liable to inspire
retrospective thought in the minds of
people capable of thinking, next
Monday should, perhaps, be set
aside as a national holiday during
which the nation should be forced
to stay at home for solemn reflection.
Monday is the 40th anniversary of the
Fisher Government’s decision to make
Canberra the Federal capital. At the
time a now-unknown poet wrote a few
stanzas about it and finished with the
forecast:
The politicians like swift nightmares pass
Thro’ the bright, hissing biograph of Fate.
Gov’ments go in and out again, alas!
No god or devil can turn otf the gas
Nor bid the turner wait.
The shadows rush for ever thro’ the night,
The windy ghosts stampede on soundless feet,
And we who are a-weary of the sight
Long for a god to take a hatpin bright
And pin one to the sheet.
The years go by; the running sands of Time
Dwindle and fall in an unending stream.
The old brown Tortoise winks amid the slime
And crawls a little further —like this rhyme —
Whilst the Hare dreams its dream.
Forty years ago the country had plenty
of poets who could break into topical
verse at a moment’s notice; there are
few today. Maybe that’s because we’ve
become old and somewhat dull before
our time, having in those 40 years been
through two great wars, a boom and*a
depression, with another boom on and
a “recession” inevitable, in the process
calmly surrendering to the creeping
paralysis of overgovernment and a com-
forting but silly belief that nothing
matters very much, and if it does tHe
Government ought to do something.
Whether Canberra is partly to blame
depends on the point of view, but its
40th anniversary oughtn’t to pass without
some contemplation of its past, present
and future. However they be inspected,
there isn’t wanting evidence that instead
of a Federal Capital, wherein impartial
government, following reasonable party
policies and concerned with the welfare
and defence and progress of Australia, is
served by a devoted public service, we’ve
got a sort of inaccessible Lhasa stuffed
with departmental high-priests who>regard
anybody who doesn’t share their
monasteries as fit only to obey without
question whatever orders they issue.
“Gov’ments go in and out again,” but
the mountain of regulations and forms
and files grows and grows and grows, and,
like old Pelion of Hellas, shoots forth its
thunders into all corners of the continent
and the islands that gem its seas. So the
businessman must have the mountain’s
permission ere he buys a ton of
that or sells a ton of this, and
the Australian woman dare not buy
butter or tea or get herself a job in
Guam or Manila without the mountain’s
approval. The poet’s “windy ghosts” on
“soundless feet” were pleasant spectres
compared with those which emanate from
our holy city—holy in the sense that not
only may you not live there without per-
mission, but if you do you must inexor-
ably accept its caste system and cir-
cumscribe yourself and the missus and
kids within a rigid circle —to haunt the
dreams of men who love freedom.
For these 40 years have brought us all
closer to that culmination of the bureau-
crat’s ambition, a society wherein nothing
from breathing to beer-drinking shall be
done without a licence, and the election
of this or that party to the Government
doesn’t mean a thing, since future Gov-
ernments will be merely the acolytes of
the high-priests. Maybe the best thing
to do would be to mark the 40th anni-
versary by changing the name of our
free (hm-m-m) and enlightened (huh!)
Commonwealth to Canberralia.


PLAIN ENGLISH
"Was Keane a Crook?"
Back in more spacious days when human
lives and actions were ordered by custom
and sentiment instead of by hard-faced
politicians and the rules and regulations
of bureaucrats, an indispensable item in
any suburban drawing-room was the
autograph-album in which every visitor
was expected to pen a few lines of wit or
wisdom. Occasionally an independent
soul would compose his own message ;
more often recourse was had to safe
quotations from the standard poets ; but
most of the album verse consisted of a
multitude of anonymous jingles. In this
field there was one sentiment without
which no collection was complete; it
was impossible to read far through any
album without coming across the charm-
ing thought:
In your golden chain of friendship
Regard me as a link.
Nowadays the autograph-book is
merely a means whereby small boys
pester famous cricketers, but the senti-
ment which inspired it is not entirely
dead. It flourishes, albeit shyly, in most
unexpected places. At a Customs sale
in Sydney last’ week one lot, knocked
down for £BO5, included 17 metal chains,
the links of which were in the form of
letters, each chain spelling out a name.
It is too late now to determine who was
the anonymous genius who wrote the
familiar album lines, but it seems un-
likely that the gentleman who bought the
metal chains will be allowed to remain
in modest obscurity.
In Canberra Mr. Rankin, member for
Bendigo, asked Commerce Minister Pol-
lard to ascertain:
(1) The name and address of the buyer.
(2) The list of articles in lot 955, with
full description of the type of metal of
which each article was composed.
(3) If there was any breach of banking
regulations if such articles, or any of them,
were' made of gold, or had a predomi-
nantly gold content.
(4) Whether the 17 metal key chains
listed were of gold, and whether the links
were in the form of letters comprising the
names of the following persons: W. Urqu-
hart, E. J. Ward, Ossie Porter, Pat King,
Virgilo Frittolia, Stan Hunt, Edward Mc-
Mahon, Len Currey, Harry Goodman, J.
Goldstein, Frank Carberry, Percy Page,
Andy Buck, Robert Mitchell, Ken Herman,
Stan Nielson and John Heighway.
Mr. Pollard promised to ask the
present Minister for Trade and Customs
(Senator Courtice) whether he could
“throw any light” on the matter.
The story behind the auction sale be-
gins in March, 1946, when the late
Senator Keane, at the time Minister for
Trade and Customs, and Mr. Joseph
Goldberg, a Sydney businessman, arrived
in America together. There is no evi-
dence that either gentleman was a col-
lector of autographs, but apparently each
regarded the other as a link in his golden
chain of friendship. At any rate, Joe
later spoke of the Senator, to Customs
men, as “a very dear friend.” In Wash-
ington, according to Goldberg, the
Senator asked him to buy some goods
for him, handing over 3000 dollars to
pay for them. The goods were “some
pearls, 1000 dollars’-worth of dress orna-
ments, 100 pairs of nylon stockings, some
perfume, handbags, shoes and other
things.”
The Senator died before the buying
was completed, but Goldberg bought on,
his purchases including “39 bracelets, 22
pairs of ladies’ footwear, 156 brooches.”
On his own account he bought “two
strings of pearls for Bill,” identified as
W. T, Kirk, one of Senator Keane’s
secretaries, and “some key-chains for
friends of mine, Dr. McMahon, Frank
Carberry and E. J. Ward.”
In July, 1946, Goldberg arrived back
in Sydney in the Monterey. Also on
board was Miss Rosetta Kelly, secretary
to the Australian War Supplies Procure-
ment in Washington, and among Miss
Kelly’s luggage were trunks labelled as
for Senator Keane’s widow. Contents of
the trunks included the Keane purchases,
amounting to “more than 4350 dollars,”
and Goldberg’s pearls and key-chains.
Sequel was a Customs charge against
Goldberg—heard after several adjourn-
ments and another trip abroad complete
with air priority and passport—and his
conviction in a fine of £250 plus £5O
witness fees and £5 13s. costs.
Miss Kelly was not called as a witness.
Neither was Mrs. Keane, nor W. T. Kirk.
Goldberg appealed, and when the Federal
Opposition raised the question of an in-
quiry into the whole business the Speaker
ruled that no discussion could be allowed
as the case was sub judice. Another year
went by, and in April, 1948, Goldberg
won his appeal to the N. S. Wales Full
Court. His conviction was quashed, the
Chief Justice remarking that it was
“curious, to say the least, that Goldberg
should have been selected as the person
to be charged,” The Judge’s remark
brought a rebuke from Dr. Evatt that
“the comment was quite unjustified”—a
rather extraordinary statement to be
made by a Federal Attorney-General
about a Chief Justice.
The contents of the “Keane trunks”
came under the hammer last week. Two
years ago Senator Courtice gave the value
of the goods in the trunks as £1230. Last
Thursday lot 955, which comprised only
a portion of the goods, but included the
key-chains, brought £BO5. The Customs
list described the items as “metal key-
chains and imitation pearls.” Possibly the
rise in price-levels since November, 1946,
accounts for the unknown buyer bidding
£805; possibly he is a man of sentiment
to whom links in the golden chain of
friendship mean more than money. Per-
haps Senator Courtice’s reply to Mr.
Rankin will “throw some light” on the
matter.
Light is something the Keane trunks
have been crying out for for over two
years. The last time the matter was
raised in Canberra the Prime Minister
rebuked the Opposition for “going down
to the grave to get some cheap advantage
over the Government.” Had the trunks
gone to the grave with Senator Keane
the P.M. might be justified in letting them
rest; but the manner of their arrival in
Australia and their peculiar subsequent
history have raised too many unanswered
questions for the Government to continue
to treat the matter as something sacred to
the memory of a departed colleague. One
BALING OUT.
Sydney paper last week reported Joseph
Goldberg as saying, “I have been perse-
cuted through this matter. Oh, how I
wish I could talk.” It also claimed that
be said that if there was a change of
Government tomorrow there would be a
Royal Commission into the whole matter.
A Royal Commission there should cer-
tainly be, but it should not wait upon a
change of Government. The Bulletin’s
oft-repeated question, “Was Keane a
Crook?” should be answered through an
adequate and open judicial investigation.
McKenna's Arithmetic.
Only a few weeks ago the A.L.P. con-
ference re-endorsed the Government’s
nationalisation programme with emphasis.
Yet already Canberra Ministers are shy-
ing away from the word “nationalisation”
as though a curse had been put upon it.
Of course the general elections which will
bloom with next spring, tra la, have
nothing to do with the case.
So Mr. Chifley, who a year ago took
the limelight as pathfinder for the Socialist
revolution, denied last week that there is
any taint (not his word) of nationalisation
in the Broadcasting Bill; and simul-
taneously the Minister for Health de-
clared that his new National Health
Service Bill does not nationalise doctors,
dentists, or the extension of their profes-
sional services. Not a bit of it; the bill,
he explains, will merely authorise the
Treasury to take over half the liability
for the entire community’s doctor and
dentist bills, and in return claim an equal
voice, through departmental regulations,
in the running of medical and dental prac-
tices.
This medical bill is only the first step
in development of a subsidised nation-
wide health service which, as in Britain
also, means nationalising it in any
accepted meaning of the term. Why do
the apostles of nationalisation of every-
thing pretend differently? How else shall
be described a scheme under which, at its
discretion, the Government may take over
the manufacture of medical and dental
supplies “if they cannot be obtained
otherwise,” and requires that great
numbers of new specialists shall, if trained
in the new Government schools, “be con-
fined to practice within the [new] public
service”?
With the growth of great modern cities,
the congestion of their populations, and
the unnatural conditions of life imposed
upon them by industry and environment,
the call for extension of Government ad-
ministration (and financial aid) in the
combating of disease and sickness is in-
exorable, The medical.profession every-
where has recognised the new responsi-
bility so thrust upon the political
authority. But the atmosphere in which
the necessary organisation should be
worked out is still that of a free demo-
cracy and not of a dictatorship. That is
one of the fundamental truths which the
8.M.A., it was supposed, has in some
degree brought the Minister to accept.
Among other foolish pretences, the
ridiculous underestimation of the cost of
the outlined National Health Service
ought to be abandoned at once. Senator
McKenna estimates that with “full par-
ticipation” in the scheme by the doctors,
the cost to the Government of meeting
half of all patients’ fees will be
£6,000,000 a year, and of the dental ser-
vice £4,000,000, That is £lO million in
all, and puts the total cost (patients pay-
ing the other half) at £2O million —or
only £2 13s. 4d. per annum for every
man, woman and child in Australia.
Well, there are round about 2,000,000
taxpayers in the Commonwealth—a con-
servative figure—and they are allowed
annually £4O rebate by the Taxation De-
partment for medical expenses and £lO
for dental expenses—£so in all —for the
taxpayer, and the same for his wife and
for each child under 21. Even limiting
the £5O rebate to taxpayers only, the
Taxation Assessment Act’s estimate of a
fair thing for annual doctor and dental
fees is £lOO million a year. A “free” —
or partly “free” —medical service will
bring a spate of real or imaginary sick
people to the doctors’ doors, as British
experience has shown. And Senator Mc-
Kenna tells us that here the annual ex-
penditure on medical and dental care is
not only going to diminish, but will shrink
from £5O a head annually to £2 13s. 4d.!
Can mere “nationalisation” of treat-
ment work that miracle?
Radio Dictatorship.
Canberra “Labor” would have the com-
munity believe that the reincarnation of
Dr. Goebbels in the Chifley Govern-
ment's Broadcasting Bill is merely a
mirage.
Mr. Chifley says, in those now-stereo-
typed, pontifical terms which he uses, that
there is nothing at all of nationalisation
in it. Neither was there in his 1946 elec-
tion policy speech. But the absolute
Ministerial control of all radio broadcasts,
either directly or through Ministerial
nominees, permeates the bill.
No doubt there is room for some tight-
ening of control over programmes and
over any tendency towards the aggran-
disement of monopolies or commercial
trusts. The Bulletin has already said
that it is the proper province of the Gov-
ernment to safeguard the public’s interest
—their real interest —in these things,
more especially by encouraging any
necessary competition. But what relation
does this responsibility bear to the pro-
vision in the bill banning all broadcasts
on political issues less than five years
old? And why must a Minister claim to
be the deciding authority on what is
“controversial” in any broadcast state-
ment or address?
Mr, Archie Cameron is a rugged
character, and had his own reasons for
supporting the creation of a controlling
board apart from the Post Office and
the Broadcasting Commission. Many
people will agree with him. If his vote
was a defection from the Opposition, so
was Mr. Fraser’s from the Government
side. Mr. Fraser, for once, hit the point.
“The Government would be doing a
public service if it legislated to ensure
that no Minister or official could
shackle public expression or dictate to
the adult population what it should hear.”
The point is freedom of speech. There
may be abuses under the present adminis-
tration which require correction. But if
such correction can be obtained only by
abolition of freedom of speech—and it
seems incredible that political resource is
so limited—then freedom of speech is of
first importance, and the abuses should be
left to curative treatment by other influ-
ences.
Goebbels in his day offered all the
arguments that Canberra is using for this
elevation of Government control as the
introduction to the rule of propaganda
in the interests of party despotism. There
shall be but one lawgiver, the Ftihrer
(ran the Goebbels doctrine), and Goebbels
is his propagandist. Socialisation’s artful
aid in Australia under Mr. Chifley is to
be this bill. Once give him power to ban
radio comments on (for instance) the
Bank Grab Act for the coming elections,
and all freedom of the press and of
public speech will follow.
We are suffering the hangover from a
disastrous war waged to resist this iniquity
under Hitlerism and totalitarianism
generally. Is Australia expected to accept
the same thing from the Chifley Ministry
without protest?
Drakeford's Boomerang.
Whatever injury Judge Simpson’s report
on the Lutana air crash did to public
confidence in the Civil Aviation Depart-
ment, that confidence must have been
almost destroyed by Mr. Drakeford’s
criticism of the Judge’s findings. The
Judge is a man trained in the sifting of
evidence, pledged to impartiality, and
used to reaching decisions only after long
and careful examinations of the facts
before him. And he has delivered a re-
port in which Mr. Drakeford’s Civil
Aviation Department was shown to be
culpable.
Mr. Drakeford, on the other hand, had
an axe to grind. As the Minister of that
Department, and as a member of a
Ministry which apparently is con-
vinced that its administration is so per-
fect as to be beyond criticism, he at once
went on the defensive, backed his depart-
ment and criticised the Judge’s findings.
In adopting that attitude the Minister
did no service to civil aviation. The
more important function of the inquiry,
more important than discovering the
cause of the accident, was to make the
travelling public—somewhat alarmed by
the crash and two others which followed
it, all attended with the usual dispropor-
tionate press sensationalism —aware that
not only is air travel supervised as to
routes, times, safety of machines, effi-
ciency of operators and so forth as
scrupulously as any other form of public
transport. In other words, the very fact
that an air accident should be followed
by a close inquiry as to its causes, with
a view to discovering any faults in the
system of operation and supervision and
to remedy them, is a guarantee to the
public that no means are neglected to
make air-travel safe.
The inquiry revealed, as did a similar
one into the loss of the Kyeema 10 years
ago, that there were faults in both the
instruments and the methods of the De-
partment of Civil Aviation, upon which
falls the duty of controlling air traffic.
Had Mr. Drakeford been content to
accept it, and to assure the public that
where remedies and improvements could
be made they would be made, the public
would also have been content. There
would have been sadness that lives
had to be lost to discover the faults, but
that applies to many other human activi-
ties.
As it is, the Drakeford criticism has
made whatever case the Civil Aviation
Department had all the weaker, and both
the department and its Minister have not
only weakened public confidence in
themselves but done a good deal of
harm to aviation in general.

CARRERAS LIMITED OVER 150 YEARS REPUTATION FOR QUALITY

POLITICAL POINTS
N. S. Wales municipal elections, the
first to be held under the Cahill Local
Government Act, will take place next
Saturday. The Act made voting compul-
sory on the basis of the Commonwealth
franchise, with fines for those who don’t
exercise the privilege which has now be-
come an obligation. Not one person in
10 knows what it is all about; fewer
still know the names of the candidates in
their ward or even what ward they are in ;
a large proportion aren’t even aware that
there is an election. The job of prose-
cuting is to be left to the councils, which,
in effect, means the candidates who are
favored by those who do vote. As it will
be the defeated candidates who will have
the most cause for resentment against the
non-voters it seems hardly likely that the
winners will be in a hurry to fine the
apathetic ones.
Immediately after the loss of the Gee-
long seat in the Victorian Assembly by-
election, “Labor” apologists tried to pre-
tend that the cause of the defeat was the
drift of too many Communist no-hope’s
preferences to the Liberal candidate.
“Labor’s” official “Standard” finally
arrived at the unpalatable truth: “Gee-
long was lost because workers and their
wives and adult children voted against
the Labor candidate.” Geelong never
had any doubts about it.
Instead of appointing a banker to the
job of governor of the Commonwealth
Bank, Chifley has picked a political
economist in the most literal sense of the
term. The appointment of Dr. Coombs
speaks volumes for the nature of the
whole Chifley bank-nationalisation pro-
gramme.
There may be a conflict of opinion as
to who is the Jonah in the boat at Can-
berra, but Dr. Evatt’s claims continue
to be emphasised by events. His apparent
victory at the Privy Council appeal in
the nationalisation-of-banking case co-
incided with the naming of George Gib-
son, a “Labor” director of the Bank of
England, as a party in “the graft in-
quiry.” And on the day when the royal
visit to Australia was called off because
of the serious state of the King’s health,
his Majesty’s Government at Canberra, as
represented at U.N.O. by a Mr. Hood,
stridently dissociated itself from the policy
of his Majesty’s Government at West-
minster on the Palestine issue.
It is the duty of a Minister to defend
his staff against unfair criticism ; it is not
his function to whitewash them when
obvious shortcomings have been made
public by an unprejudiced tribunal, any
more than it is his right to shelter behind
them when his own administration is in
question. The attitude of Air Minister
Drakeford over Mr. Justice Simpson’s
report on the loss of the airliner Lutana
would be hard to understand were it not
so typical of the form of every Chifley
Minister towards criticism. “Labor”
Ministers can do no wrong, even by
proxy. They know everything; they can
be taught nothing.
The Victorian “Labor” Senator
Hendrickson was Keane’s secretary, and
largely on that account was given the
party nomination which led to his land-
ing a seat for six years, a salary-increase
of £5OO (to £1500), the promise of £8 a
week for life if he lasts eight years at
Canberra and the prospect of a life-pass
oyer Government railways, tramways and
airlines, to say nothing of Government
steamers. The auction of the contents of
the Keane trunks recalls that, although
for two years there has been prima facie
evidence that Keane vilely abused his
position as Minister of the Crown,
Hendrickson has never been known to
renounce or defend his former chief.
Future orators in the House of Com-
mons will do their orating on Australian
timber, 140,000 super, feet of North
Queensland walnut having been ordered
for the new floor in the remodelled
House. A pernickety member of the
Mother of Parliaments asked the Minister
of Supply whether he was aware “that
about every fiftieth plank of this other-
wise excellent hardwood develops a most
frightful smell,” and whether he would
in the interests of the House “see that
every plank is carefully examined.” The
Minister replied that he was certain those
concerned would see to that. So far there
has been neither confirmation nor denial
of a story that the rejected planks, if any,
will be brought back to Australia and
used for reflooring the Caucus room at
Canberra,
Sol Rosevear is back from his wander-
ings. Most relieved man in Australia is
probably Acting-Speaker Clark.
In the course of evidence at the British
Board of Trade inquiry which is investi-
gating charges that Mr. Belcher, Parlia-
mentary Secretary to the Board, and other
Ministers and officials have been offered
or have received bribes, Belcher’s secre-
tary said of the central figure of the
case, a man of many aliases, that he
“entered Belcher’s office very frequently,
sometimes without an appointment. He
always seemed to have access to Belcher.”
Something oddly familiar about that
last bit of evidence.
Chifley is no orator, but as a debater
he has a few effective shots in his locker.
The most valuable of them —though it is
now almost worn out through too fre-
quent use—is his adoption of a disarming
pose whereby he endeavors to make an
important matter seem a mere triviality.
“There has been some talk,” “I have
heard something about that matter,” “I
believe there was something in the papers,
though I didn’t, read it myself,” are a
few of his favorite openings when he
rises to discount accusations from the
other side of the House. In the debate
on the Radio Bill he used the technique
in dealing with the John Henry Austral
broadcasts. There had been “some talk
about political dramatisations,” said the
P.M. “He had not listened to the plays
which had been referred to, but disin-
terested people who were not Labor sup-
porters had told him the plays disgusted
them.” This is too ingenuous even for
Chifley. Since when has “Labor” worried
about the feelings of people who are not
“Labor” supporters, whether disinterested
or otherwise?
Cabled that the British press has
sacrificed sporting stuff and even editorial-
page comment in order to present full
and particular accounts of the football-
pools inquiry in which Polish Jews—one
with a catalogue of aliases —Ministers
and other “Labor” dignitaries are “men-
tioned.” We don’t do that there ’ere.
In Sydney on Friday a former “Labor”
M.H.R. alleged on oath that he had
offered a “consideration” of £5OOO in £ 10-
notes to a “Labor” Minister and had been
told to hand it to a certain “Bill,” which
he said he did. Whether he told the truth
will be decided in due course. The point
is that the allegation was dismissed in
brief newspaper reports, whereas pages
were given over to the Saturday races.
Mr. Chifley’s comment on recent air
disasters: “Whatever precautions are
taken there are bound to be accidents
once men begin to imitate birds.” What
his country is waiting for is for Mr.
Chifley and his colleagues to begin imitat-
ing men.
If Chifley doesn’t like the proposed in-
crease of 2d. a gallon in retail petrol
prices, which “apparently the Prices Com-
missioners think is warranted” through
increased landing costs, all he has to do
is reduce appropriately his present
Customs levy of lOd. a gallon plus 10
per cent, primage, and the extra costs of
petrol fuel itself need not then be loaded
on to Australian industry.
Dilly Daly’s troubles and travels aren’t
over yet. The first redistribution plan
made his Martin seat more than shaky,
but the revised scheme, remoulded
nearer to the heart’s desire of Caucus,
dragged Balmain into his electorate and
made it a sitter for “Labor.” The trouble
about a “safe” seat is that it isn’t always
safe against your friends. Daly’s col-
league O’Connor, of West Sydney, has
decided that Martin will just suit him,
and as the deciding sector, Balmain, is a
slice of his present electorate, his claim
is well staked. Daly can’t switch to
West Sydney (now Sydney); Dan
Minogue, of the City Council, is after
that. A seat will have to be found for
Daly somewhere ; he’s the best asker of
Dorothy Dixes “Labor” ever had.
Queensland Assembly debated its Esti-
mates for 16 days, and at the finish had
disposed of only two out of 14 depart-
ments and about £5,000,000 out of
£63,000,000. Opposition-Leader Nicklin
suggested that in future a fixed time be
allotted to each department instead of an
overall time for the whole boiling. A
couple of Ministers agreed with him, but
Acting-Premier Gair and Deputy-Opposi-
tion-Leader Maher considered present
Standing Orders gave ample time for
discussion if it was properly used. They
were probably right, too. Longwinded-
riess is a vice in all our legislatures ; too
many members say what they have to
say and then keep on talking.
A drought having hit Queensland dairy
districts, the usual appeal to help the
“stricken farmers” bobbed up in the Bris-
bane Parliament. Agriculture Minister
Collins suggested the dairy coves could
have helped themselves if they had gone
in for fodder conservation, pasture im-
provement, herd-testing and other things.
Right enough. But would Mr, Collins
suggest to importunate unionists that if
they saved their money they’d be better
off? One of (he worst evils of party
politics is that so many sections of the
community have come to expect Govern-
ment hand-outs of cash for everything
from droughts to dog-racing.
Q.P.P. president Hulme last week in-
vited the Queensland Country party to
hold a poll of its members to see whether
a majority favors amalgamation of the
two parties. Country-party president
Campbell said he didn’t know whether
the amalgamation was to be with the
Kewpies or the Liberals generally, and
he wanted to know why the Kewpies had
“persistently refused the C.P.’s friendly,
genuine hand of friendship and co-opera-
tion.” No answer being forthcoming, he
agreed to “consider any reasonable re-
quest.” Which ought to prove something,
but doesn’t.
Keon, “Labor” member for Richmond
in the Victorian Parliament, was sus-
pended until the end of the year for
alleging bias against the Speaker when
that functionary accepted a motion that
Keon be no longer heard. The suspen-
sion debate lasted four hours. Better
things were expected of Keon, a doughty
opponent of Communism, but he can’t
expect to get away with things like that
just because the war-cry of his suburb’s
football team is “Eat ’em alive. Tigers!”
Russia, always solicitous for the wel-
fare of “subject races” in areas remote
from her own borders, attacked South
Africa for refusing to hand over former
German S.-W. Africa to the U.N.O.
Trusteeship Council. S’Africa’s Mr.
Louw came back with “Why doesn’t the
Soviet hand over East Prussia, East
Poland and parts of Finland to the
Council? And what about Lithuania,
Estonia and Latvia?” The Russian dele-
gate made no reply. He had challenged
South Africa under sub-clause (a) of
Article 77 of the United Nations Charter,
which refers to territories held under
mandate. Sub-clause (b) provides that
the trusteeship system shall also apply to
“territories which may be detached from
enemy States as a result of the Second
World War.”
The Northern Territory is a long way
from the crowded southern cities, and
means nothing to most of their inhabi-
tants, but it has a member at Canberra,
though he hasn’t a vote on non-Territory
matters. Papua and New Guinea are
further off still, but there are more whites
living there than in the N.T. They haven’t
a vote, but they have “Guvaman pfeller
Ward, kanaka belong Sydney.” And, as
Mr. Ward will admit, what more could
they want?
Joint action by State Governments to
ban left-hand drive vehicles is likely as a
result of a conference in Canberra. It’s
only toying with the problem. The in-
fluence of the Left-hand drive is apparent
in every action of the Federal “Labor”
Government, yet nothing is being done
about that.
According to London “Daily Tele-
graph” the Governor of Cyprus is think-
ing of resigning unless he gets more sup-
port from the Home Government in deal-
ing with sedition on his island, where
Communists are reported to be adopting
standover tactics and collecting “protec-
tion-money” from shopkeepers and busi-
ness houses. Under the Stafford Cripps
menage he cannot expect much help from
Whitehall; only a month ago the “Labor”
knight told a Bristol audience that he
still struck to a statement he made in 1935
that the policy of the Socialist party was
the liquidation of the -British Empire.
Recently Cripps has criticised Com-
munism, yet as Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer he gave Communist-controlled
Scottish miners permission to send £lOOO
to the striking French miners.
British housewives were heartened by
a recent announcement that their
December meat ration would be a pound
a week instead of 12 ounces, but before
they’d had time to congratulate them-
selves down came the bacon issue from
two ounces to one. Australians, with all
their troubles, have a lot to be thankful
for. i
“Hansard” exercises a considerable
amount of discretion in reporting
speeches ; it polishes up the literary style
of members, omits the ers and urns and
sees that the. aspirates go in the right
places. The practice makes for easier
reading, though it may not give posterity
a true picture of our legislators. Occa-
sionally a touch of realism is allowed to
stand, as on page 35 of the proceedings of
the present session, when, apparently to
convey that the Prime Minister was suf-
fering from a heavy cold, he was reported
as referring to Dr. Evatt and Senator
Armstrong as “by colleagues.”
If Liberal- and Country-party members
agree to appoint representatives to the
board of trustees of the Caucus “three-
quid-a-week-gets-you-eight” pension plan
they will deserve to remain in Opposition
till the scheme pays its way.
If, as a result of opencut mining, this
country ever does manage to bring to day-
light more coal than industry requires the
sane thing to do would be to close those
mines which are the most expensive to
operate. But there should be no need to
close any. This country once had a big
export trade in coal. The market is still
there if miners only get down to the task
of winning coal instead of winning mock
victories at the expense of other workers
in industry.
“A burglar’s jemmy to crack the capi-
talist crib,” was Churchill’s description of
the British Socialists’ bill to “nationalise”
the steel industry. Why didn’t somebody
think of that when Chifley made his 42-
word declaration against the trading-
banks?
“Lottery Results” is no longer a selling
poster-line for Sydney afternoon papers.
Publication of the “draw” is as certain as
the weather map, and indications point to
a Government lottery every day, Monday
to Friday. In other words, while output
in mines, factories and workshops has
gone to the bowwows production of
lottery tickets has reached an all-time
high. A moralist would find a connection.

“Nabawa Ned”: Somewhere about
1936 a Russian scientist broke loose with
“perennial wheat,” a plant that was to
obviate the necessity for sowing the stuff
every year and which would rapidly place
the Soviet far ahead of (he effete demo-
cracies in wheat production. A few
credulous journalists took the thing seri-
ously and sundry agricultural experts be-
came slightly enthusiastic. But, probably
due to Fascist tendencies in the glumes
or perhaps because some dirty capitalist
spy mixed weevils with the seed, nothing
more was heard of it. Now the Russians
are out with a “branched wheat that
promises harvests five times as rich as the
standard varieties.” The branches have
“large heads containing 150 to 200
grains,” though whether they have to be
propped up or reinforced with wire isn’t
stated. Nor is it known whether or not
the collectivised wheat cocky in the
Ukraine will have to climb the branches
and saw off the heads or merely drop
the. whole tree. Any time now 7 I expect
to see a picture of laughing Stalinite
peasant women, in their fine clothing and
rich footwear, sitting in the shade of a
Soviet wheat-plant waiting for the harvest
hands to come in from the fields for
morning-tea and cake under the laden
branches. Ah, me, how different from
our own backward country!

there was a wild rush to grab it. The
first to reach it was Ray Goldsmith, of

by Sapper Wallace Hooton, of Went-
worth. It then mysteriously disappeared
for six years.

casual glances had

titiously saved him-
self twopence. But two
china-blue eyes had
observed the salvage.
“Why, George,” she
whispered. “You’re not
going to read that, are
you?” George flushed.
“It wasn’t on the floor,
you know; it was on
the seat,” he explained
guiltily. “Yes, but you
don’t know who put it
there,” the girl pro-
tested. “It might have
been some horrible old
man with an infectious
complaint or something.
And you know how
some people lick their
fingers when they turn
over a page,” George
cast the paper under the
seat. A few minutes
later two schoolboys

and promptly dived on

“F.S.”: Victoria’s annual bushfire
season is approaching, with the fire risk
throughout the State as great as ever.
With 907 rural fire-brigades and 64,000
registered volunteer fire-fighters, fire-
spotting towers equipped with wireless,
the organised assistance of the Air Force
and the nucleus of a helicopter squadron,
the State has the best fire-prevention
service it has ever had ; but it is largely
negatived by apathy of property-owners.
Even in some of the death-traps in the
mountains where hell has broken loose
on dozens of occasions none but the con-
ventional precautions have been taken.
“Well, you look all right to me.”
The big trees still stand on the sides of
the funnel-like gullies, and grass and
undergrowth grow up to the doorsteps in
the townships. Nothing but an authority
with powers to compel owners to protect
themselves will alter the situation.

“Uramao”: Officialdom will not permit
the cock’s shrill clarion to wake the
State tenants from their lowly beds in
Wellington (M.L.), Tenants of State
houses may keep 12 laying fowls provided
the hen-coops conform to municipal
standards ; but no male birds may be kept.
It is good news for those who like to
sleep in, but far-sighted citizens are sug-
gesting that it is time someone took the
officials aside and whispered in their ears.

“Chevroford”: In the past few years
trees probably running into thousands
have been chopped down in and around
Melbourne by city and suburban councils,
gas, electric-light and sewerage boards;
a recent flagrant case of arboreal murder
was the removal of the famous bent trees
painted by many artists in a street near
St. Patrick’s Cathedral. It is not recorded
that anybody was fined, imprisoned or put
in the stocks for any of these mis-
demeanors. It has been left to Mr.
Steedman, S.M., of Geelong (Vic.), to
establish a precedent in this direction.
For having unlawfully and maliciously
cut in half a plane-tree planted for the
beautification of Latrobe-terrace, Geelong
West, a youth of 18 was sentenced to
seven days’ jail. The plea that drink had
dulled his aesthetic sense on the occasion
didn’t go down with his Honor.

“Ophelia”: The wearing of unorthodox
eyelets to his shoes (B. 10/11/ ’4B) was
the means of putting a notorious Ameri-
can kidnapper behind iron bars. With
two accomplices he had seized a wealthy
man, bound and gagged him and bundled
him into the back of a car. As the victim
lay on the floor he noticed something
peculiar about the eyelets on the shoes
one man was wearing. Who in the whole
of America would wear square eyelets?
The police soon found out.
“Toe-cap”: If “Herculaces” (B.
24/11 /’4B) wants to know why the metal
lace-clips which once decorated school-
boy boots aren’t made now, let him look
around. How many schoolboys wear
boots these days?

“Ex-C.G.”: Melbourne was awakened
to the existence of an Australian felt-hat
industry (B. 24/11 /’4B) one morning
about 25 years ago when the incoming
toilers saw two felt hats sitting atop flag-
poles on a Flinders-street newspaper
office. It was at first assumed to be
either a student- or drunken-reporter-
prank, but later it was announced that
one hat was an imported Italian tile
selling at around £3, the other was
locally-made and sold at a quid. They
floated aloft in order to prove or dis-
prove the Australian claim that the local
cady would stand up to Australian
weather as well as, if not better than, the
Italian. Before anyone rushes in to de-
clare that Melbourne weather isn’t a fair
sample of the Australian climate, let
me say that after the stipulated period
both hats were examined and the result
was a draw.

“Sixenate”: The cost of living has
gone up, also, for litigants. Fees for
witnesses have taken another upward
bound, from 16s. to 255. a day for the
common or garden witness and from a
guinea to two guineas for professionals.
Court fees are up, too ; the plain sum-
mons, which once cost eight bob (and
before that six), is now 10s., with all other
fees taking a sympathetic rise. Lawyers
are also seeking the sanction of the
Courts for a scale of increased charges.
The profession has an excuse in increased
office rent and salaries of typists and
others. With time wasted in court and
all these new charges, the old hobby of
litigation has become an expensive one;
but the costliness does not check it.
Court lists are always overcrowded, and
there is usually a carryover of cases from
day to day. Some lawyers, once almost
pathetic in their eagerness for a chance
to earn fees, are now nearly as offhand
about accepting new clients as tram-
conductors are about the collecting of
fares.

“Chain Smoker”: Our church’s efforts
to raise funds for its Christmas-tree were
lagging, and the committee decided on
some lectures to swell the funds. The
schoolteacher obliged with three talks.
First was on native weapons, and atten-
dance was poor; second dealt with tribal
customs —roll-up slightly less. Final
lecture on forms of pagan worship packed
the hall to bursting-point. Next day
brought an explanation. When announced
hurriedly Pagan Sects can be misinter-
preted, especially when in competition
with back-seat coughers. Anyway, the
kids’ll have a whopper Christmas-tree
this year.
* * * *
“Lao-dah”: I see that 2000 volumes
of Chinese classics have been presented to
the Australian National University at
Canberra by the Chinese Ambassador,
Mr. Kan Nai-kuang. They are photo-
static copies of the encyclopaedia the
Emperor Kien-lung had made in the
eighteenth century, or, rather, a small
portion of the 36,000 volumes of the
original work. The Chinese emperors
were whales on scholarship. Around the
year a.d. 600 there were already 370,000
volumes in existence, and the imperial
collection of the Tang dynasty numbered
208,000 volumes. By the time of Kien-
lung the country was so cluttered up with
books that an overhaul was made and
the encyclopaedia was ordered, anything
derogatory to the Manchus being care-
fully excluded. The emperor’s zeal for
pedantry was so great that he is said to
have had scores of authors dismissed
from office, flung into prison, flogged or
put to death, their ancestral temples
destroyed and their families sold into
slavery, all because of the misuse of a
single word, though the emperor doesn’t
seem to have objected to the “P’inhua
Paochien,” a homosexual novel which
would earn an Australian author a heavy
sentence. Except for Lao-tsze, who said
some very wise things, and Confucius,
who said some wise and some very silly
things, the Chinese classics are largely
composed of notes on agriculture,
astronomy, astrology, necromancy,
military science, cooking, animals (real
and mythological), how to make tea, re-
ports on downfalls of blood, frogs and
fish in remote districts and haphazard
comments on everything under the sun,
especially if it is supernatural.
SHARK.
“Diners at Sydney cates ate over two tons of
shark this week. 'Some of the cafes serve it as flat-
head or bream.” —Sydney “Sun.”
Another proof, if anybody wishes
For such, of what some poet made his theme
To stress that things (including supper dishes)
Are not invariably what they seem.
So, when you think your fare consists of fishes
As succulent as flounder or as bream
You hoist it in, untroubled by a dark
Suspicion you may be devouring shark.
What odds? If there is reason for believing
The often-quoted saw that what the eye
Has missed will never set the heart a-grieving,
The principle should equally apply
That what the palate, in good faith receiving,
Has proved unable to identify
Is definitely not the sort of scran
To draw a protest from the inner man.
Who are there, making choice from what is put
on
The menu —precious few, it’s my belief —
That haven’t eaten goat disguised as mutton
Or horseflesh deftly camouflaged as beef?
And did it hurt their innards? Not a button,
Or give their gastric juices cause for grief.
How often does the rabbit deputise
For chicken in our fricassees and pies!
Ah! If restaurateurs would only table
Among attractions for the festive board
Things warranted entirely true to Igbel
(A frankness, I suppose, they can’t afford)
How far much less there’d be of airy fable
For the recording angel to record,
And less material for cooks to don
Their caps and exercise their skill upon.
There, seems to be a moral somewhere looming.
Let n* suggest it cannot be denied
The grub you fondly fancy you’re entombing
Counts more than what you really get outside,
Whether it’s goat or galah you’re consuming,
A butchered beast or one that merely died,
Some household pet that used to purr or bark,
A cuttlefish, a squid or ey’n a shark.

“Curate’s Egg”: Skullduggery in spud-
weighing, as described by “Ellar” (B.
17/11/’4B), reminds me of the time I was
the catspaw in a tactical battle between
two Army supply-officers. One com-
plained he was being given too much
soil with his potatoes; the other denied
this and said the first bloke’s scales must
be wrong. One day, by adroit
manoeuvring on the part of the allegedly
short-weighted one, an inspector of sup-
plies happened to be at his depot when
a load of the suspect spuds arrived.
After enough soil to recoup the Vic-
torian erosion losses had been shaken
from each bag the potatoes were weighed.
Perhaps the consigning Sup. O. had
been tipped off as to the presence of the
1.0.5.; the net weight of spuds was
actually in excess of that charged. The
battle then reverted to charge and
counter-charge as to the accuracy of the
respective scales. With the usual callous-
ness of commissioned rank regarding the
personal feelings of mere corporals, I
was made a test weight. After weighing
in on the scales at Railhead Supply Depot
and. on an independent set, I left with my
convoy. Next morning I was weighed
on the scales of the suspicious O.C. at
Roadhead Supply Depot. A wide dis-
parity was revealed, which should have
settled the war in favor of the consign-
ing officer. He, however, refused to
accept defeat, claiming that “the test
weight was an object of such a nature
that it was likely to be affected, as I
believe it was, by quantity of alcohol
absorbed between weighings.”

“L.R.”: “Ceg” misses other rigid con-
ditions anept the “crowning ceremony of
the cheese” (B. 3/11/ ’4B) at Simpson’s
one o’clock fish ordinary, and fails to do
sufficient justice to that once-famous
personage, the master of ceremony* In
addition to estimating the correct weight
of the cheddar, the diners had to mark
on their slips their idea of its measure-
ments. After Grace had been intoned
the master would announce: “Ladies and
gentlemen, according to our ancient cus-
tom we will now take the height, girth
and weight of this cheese.” The winner
was required to have all three answers
correct on his slip, and occasionally, as
“Ceg” remembers, someone would have
the right answers. For many years the
master of the cheese and fish was Mr.
Shelton, a grave and dignified old
gentleman with white Victorian whiskers.
As well as being a connoisseur of
cheese, he had a vast knowledge of edible
fish and how to cook, sauce and serve
them. He must have been well over 80
when soldiers of the First A.I.F. found
their way into Simpson’s.

“Percy Pawnticket”: The arrival of the
royal Infant proved a problem for sundry
baby-production institutions which had
rashly promised a silver spoon for each
baby “bom within their gates on the
same day as the princeling.” The trouble
follows the fact that the exact minute
of birth, 9.14 p.m. on Sunday, November
14, was 7.14 a.m. on Monday, November
15, in Eastern Australia. In years to
come when the prince’s birth anniversary
appears on the calendar as the King’s
birthday it will be the Sunday-born babies
who will have the right to claim a share in
the anniversary, although they were
veterans of a number of hours before
the royal baby actually arrived. Young
mothers being very jealous of any special
distinctions that can be attached to their
infants, the problem was a real poser.
One hospital got over the difficulty by
giving spoons to both Sunday and Mon-
day babies —there were 24 of them ; but
the argument between their mothers
whether Phillip Harold, born at 9.14 p.m.
on Sunday, or Phillip Cedric, born 7.14
“Tea, Miss ?”
a.m. Monday, has the best right to be
considered the collateral infant will go
on.

“Bo”: Why they do it is a mystery,
but most Press photographers of the
female form seem to take a delight in
depicting their subjects in positions least
calculated to show them off to advantage.
A bunch of beauty-competition entrants,
for instance, will be shown sitting, in
shorts and in various artificial poses, on
a brand-new railway engine. Their fixed
grins as they gaze at the lens are seasoned
with the very obvious fear that the iron
monster is about to blow up. A vaude-
ville “lovely” will be depicted—in briefs,
of course —“steering” a yacht. Her grip
on the wheel makes her about as con-
vincing as if it were waving a baton
in front of a symphony orchestra. No
crowd of Miss Something-or-other en-
trants ever posed on a farm without hold-
ing hayforks as if they were black
snakes ; and they invariably wear beauti-
fully-tailored shorts, just like Kate-dons
when she’s taking the pig-buckets down
to the sties. But the most uncomfortable-
looking subject I’ve seen was a “beach
beauty” depicted giving a tidbit to a
racehorse. Snapped at the moment when
the soft lips were nuzzling her out-
stretched palm, the damsel’s face reflected
her fear that several of her fingers were
about to disappear into the moke’s maw.
“Tarry Rope” : That curious phenome-
non of Sydney’s ocean beaches, icy-cold
surf occasionally on really hot days, was
the subject of a par. of mine a couple of
years ago, whereupon a nark uprose and
asserted that it was impossible because
the temperature of the ocean water
varied only a few degrees, winter or
summer. The phenomenon recurred the
other day; and of the hundred thousand
who rushed the beaches only a handful
on each beach surfed. This time the
temperature of the surf waters was taken ;
it was 50 degrees at Coogee and 57
degrees at Bondi—seven degrees differ-
ence between two beaches, and both of
them decidedly below the shade tempera-
ture on shore.

“Lower Tops’l”: News that the well-
known barque Pamir will sail home to
the Baltic with a Maoriland instead of a
Finnish crew is probably the death-knell
of the few remaining windjammers left.
Before the war the Pamir and others of
the Erikson fleet of squareriggers kept at
sea only by using low-paid Finnish crews
and by doing their docking annually in
the Aaland Islands —their home port—
with cheap labor. Built in 1905 by Laeisz
of Hamburg for the carriage of Chilean
nitrate to Europe, the Pamir, with her
great strength of hull and top-hamper
allied to her great cargo capacity, repre-
sents the last challenge by sail to steam.
She can sail too, and since 1931, when
purchased by Erikson, her homeward
passages from Spencer Gulf have aver-
aged 104 days. Taken over as a war
prize by the Maoriland Government, she
goes down in history as the last square-
rigger to fly the red duster. As such she
was inspected by the King and Queen
in the Thames this year.

“Harold Hardupp”; There are some
queer policies enunciated in the muni-
cipal-election campaign in N.S.W.: one
gem in my own suburban area is the
declaration of a candidate that he will
“insist upon every ratepayer having a
decent bath.” Although it suggests a
wholesale compulsory wash under the
supervision of a squad of municipal in-
spectors, it is merely a shot in the cam-
paign for abolition of ramshackle bath-
rooms.

“Catesby”: Guy Fawkes Night (B.
17/11/’4B) is still observed in England.
At one village—Edenbridge, in Kent—
it is the great day of the year, for what
reason no one seems to know. A Bon-
fire Society arranges a torchlight proces-
sion and people come from near and far
to take part or to watch. This year’s
celebration marched to the music of 10
bands, thousands of youngsters bore the
torches, there were tableaux and floats.
and the proceedings culminated with the
lighting of a huge bonfire on which an
effigy of Guy Fawkes was burnt to the
accompaniment of a fireworks display.
“Guys” are also still paraded around
London, a fact which impelled one Lon-
doner to .write to the “Times.” His
complaint was “not the poorness of the
floor-show” put on by the youngsters
who sought his financial support, but
the fact that instead, of the traditional
cry of “penny for the guy” the young
go-getters had advanced with the times
and were demanding tuppence. He con-
cluded : “Their very audacity secured for
them their tuppence, but I feel constrained
to inquire whether the country can today
afford a surcharge of 100 per cent, for
such a matter.”
* * * ♦
“Muskeen”: Kipling used the word
“crummy” (B. 27 /10/’4B) in Stalky
and Co. When Stalky, M’Turk and
Beetle discovered the tunnel in which
they subsequently placed a dead cat over
the dormitory of a rival house in revenge
for being called stinkers, Stalky remarked,
“It’s a crummy place.” The word might
mean almost anything in this context,
but “strange” or “disagreeable” would
both be appropriate.
* * * *
“Kelms”: The Maoriland M.P. who
spoke of Feter Praser (B. 3/11/ ’4B) re-
called the unveiling of a war memorial
at Belmont (W.A.) after World War I.
The chief dignitary was Sir Talbot Hobbs,
and I’ve often speculated on his reactions
as the Road Board chairman repeatedly
referred to him as Sir Halbert Tobbs.
“Kropp”: Tell “Hypo” (B. 10/11 / ’4B)
that it is not only against lenses made
in Britain that the prejudice exists. Fifty
years ago I saw advertised in an English
magazine a razor; it was made in Shef-
field, yet it had a German name and
the most important feature about it was
that it was “genuine German ground.”
Since the First World War the makers
have advertised the same name of the
razor, but now emphasise that it is
“genuine British ground.”
* * * *
“Hist”: When it comes to commem-
orative stamps, Australia “ain’t seen
nothin’ yet,” despite our recent Farrer,
Von Mueller and Boy Scout stamps. A
letter from an American correspondent
who keeps me up-to-date in these things
enriched my collection by 15 stamps, all
issued during the past couple of months.
Centennials of the various States always
rate a stamp, and in this lot Oregon (red-
brown) and Nebraska (violet) take their
turn. Will Rogers, humorist, and Harlan
F. Stone, Chief Justice, each have a
violet stamp. A portrait of Francis Scott
Key in red is flanked by views of the
“Old Key Home” and “Fort McHenry.”
To maintain the equality of the sexes we
have Juliette Gordon Low (green),
founder of the Girl Scouts of U.S.A,;
Clara Barton (red), founder of the Ameri-
can Red Cross; and a mustard-yellow
label with a star and laurel-leaf design
honoring the Gold Star Mothers, More
centennials: The Five Civilised Indian
Tribes of Oklahoma (Cherokee, Chick-
saw, Choctaw, Muscogee, Seminole); a
Century of Friendship between U.S. and
Canada, typified in blue by a train mid-
way on the border bridge between the
two nations. A mere fiftieth anniversary
is that of the Rough Riders (brown)* but
the 300th Anniversary of Volunteer Fire-
men, with a portrait of Peter Stuyvesant,
first organiser, between a pair of fire-
engines, old,- and new style, is com-
memorated in red, A blue stamp, “Salut-
ing Young America,” marked September,
1948, as Youth Month. Also in blue
comes the Palornar Mountain Observa-
tory—no indication why it rates a stamp
just now. Finally, one more really stamp-
worthy centennial —that of the American
Poultry Industry, starring in brown what
looks to me like a matronly Langshan,
but lam open to correction. Are all
these issues a drug on the philatelic
market? Not on your life! The first
day sales of the U.S.A.-Canada stamp
amounted to 1,175,650 copies.
THE BUNGS AND THE BOOKS.
“The N.S.W. Opposition should challenge ‘Labor’
on its subservience to the Booze and Betting inter-
ests (B. 24/11/’4B).’’
It’s out, as we know and it can’t be forgot,
To brighten the downtrodden wage-earner’s lot,
To shorten his hours and to heighten his pay,
With anything else it can do in that way.
But it also maintains a benevolent pose
To certain vocations quite alien from those,
And it’s perfectly safe to assert that it looks
With special regard on the Bungs and the Books.
They are lads you can hardly envisage somehow
As earning a crust by the sweat of their brow
Or playing an even subordinate part
In getting what’s dear to the Socialist heart
And what he accounts his particular biz,
The uplift of genus humanum, that is.
But they’re high on the ladder, well up on the
rungs
Of our Government’s favor, the Books and the
Bungs.
They’re the white-headed boys, you may firmly
aver,
Of the Cabinet skippered by Jimmy McGirr,
Which looks with indulgent and tolerant gaze
On pubs that fill strangers with startled amaze,
And fails to discern any reason or cause
For drastic amendments in licensing laws.
So, whoever at “Labor’s” queer pranks may go
crook,
You may wager it won’t be the Bung or the
Book.
More courses, more race-days, ad lib and quant,
stiff.
As if —Heaven help us! —we hadn’t enough.
Night-trotting with bets, and more claipor-
filled grounds
For the chase of tin-hares by unreasoning
hounds!
More chances than ever for doing your dough
And boosting the takings of Stiffner and Co.!
Well, others may speak with malevolent tongues
Of “Labor,” but never the Books or the Bungs.

THE SERVICE MAN
JAPAN—DESTRUCTION AND PRODUCTION.
“Ek Dum” (recently returned
from Japan): Japan, conquered
and ordered at its higher levels
by its conquerors, presents some
curious paradoxes.
It shows tremendous scars, but
there are few signs of permanent
wounds or of shock either in its
economy or in its social life.
The figures which are given on
war destruction, amounting to
the fact that virtually every large
city, leaving out Kyoto, was
from one-third to seven-eighths
destroyed, do not provide data
which can be fairly assessed in
terms of Western Europe.
The destruction usually came
in the form of two or three
cataclysms, sometimes almost as
brief as a good earthquake,
usually very like an earthquake
in effect. The population
was not generally subjected to
worry-bombing and machine-
gunning night after night, to
gradual attrition, and to the
strain involved of anticipating,
month after month, whether or
not 1000 bombers would descend
within the next hour, and keep
the earth-shaking and erupting
amid an inferno of noise for
hours to come.
Bombing of Japan had as its
ingredient fire rather than h.e.
And it was “sudden death,” soon
over in one raid, or very few,
and therefore the sooner for-
gotten. Much of it was done
when there was little ack-ack
defence. The attacks lacked the
element of contest. Any Jap-
anese who went through the ex-
perience of the Tokyo earth-
quake in 1923 or Fukui in June
last year saw something worse
than most bombings, even like
that, for instance, of Fukuyama,
which was virtually wiped out to
the last building in a single blast
of fire one morning.
Hence, in a sense, the Jap-
anese, inured to earthquakes
and the resultant fire, destruction
and death which are almost part
of their daily lives, did not Suffer
the same mental and nervous
reactions which were the after-
maths of large-scale and con-
tinuous attack in Europe.
Next, the general effect of
bombing on national economy,
as illustrated by statistics, acre-
ages and general appearance of
attacked areas, is exaggerated.
It is true that hundreds of
acres were burnt out, even
hundreds of acres of factories.
But it is striking that what was
wiped out was, if important to
war potential, not always im-
portant to Japanese survival.
Japan’s Secret Weapon
Modern industry, as the out-
side world understands it,
appears when viewed in the Jap-
anese scene to have different im-
plications from the same modern
industry in the framework of a
Western nation. It puts the jam
or. Japanese bread, it improves
standards of living, it is ex-
traneous to the real core of
Japanese life and economy.
Wipe out the main industries
dependent on large factories and
organised transport in the United
States and Australia and the
whole country would starve in a
fortnight.
Sweep the same section of
endeavor into the sea in Japan
and the bulk would survive and
carry on. For Japan not only
lives off the land and sea, but it
lives close to it. The striking
fact about it is the closely-
woven intimacy between city and
country life, the brother intimacy
in which agriculture, fertilisation
and urban existence all exist
cheek by jowl and inextricably
mixed up. Even big cities have
no sanitary systems, but depend
on the “honeycart” drawn by
one hardy animal which removes
offal, scenting the roads delight-
fully en route, and conveys it
to the fields. The railway lines,
the sides of the modern roads,
are thickly lined with soya beans.
The daikon, the giant turnip of
Japan, sprouts out of the space
which some forgetful alderman
has left in the paving of a street.
“Well, chin-chin!”
The sweet-potato vines fill the
interstices between the suburban
dwellings—no Japanese suburb-
anite under the rank of magnate
would dream of using his plot
for a flower-garden.
Everywhere there is food,
food, food —all tended so care-
fully that none goes to waste,
for waste would be a capital
crime in a country where every
rag, bone and hank of hair
which can be spared goes into
the ground, where each peach
on the tree is neatly done up in
a paper-bag to keep it safe from
fly and weather, and where, when
a tree'is cut down, every scrap of
usable timber is tenderly sorted
out, every bit of firewood fag-
goted, and the remains swept up
with a little brush to become
humus.
Earth is not wasted. The
smallest hillside plots are saved
from being washed away by the
erection of the laboriously-built
granite walls which would cost
a fortune in this country. And
time and season are not wasted
by man, beast or soil.
Agricultural Method
One striking feature of Jap-
anese agriculture is firstly the
association of husbandry and
forestry—the forests are all
State-controlled, and they im-
pinge on every field which is not
an alluvial level, throughout the
length and breadth of the
country. They provide an extra-
ordinary amount of humus for
the lower fields. Another is the
long hours worked by the
farmers, the meticulous and
orderly detail in which the pro-
cesses from sowing to reaping
are carried out. A third is the
almost entire absence of any sort
of machinery which cannot be
wielded by a female right hand.
The fourth is the almost entire
absence of livestock which all
European systems insist are vital
to agriculture. A fifth is the
ordered variety of material
grown to provide staple neces-
sities and a high daily calorific
ration, a system apparently de-
signed before the calorie was
heard of. The average Japanese,
outside small, thickly-populated
and artificially-fed areas, has
rice, sometimes barley, the sweet
potato, the turnip, fruit, a little
in the way of greens, soya bean
and a little fish for his main
rations. And he and his children,
generally speaking, grow legs
like ironbark stumps and a merry
smile on such a diet.
A sixth and most astonishing
fact is that there seems to be
no fallow in Japanese agricul-
ture. The rice comes out. The
straw is hung on lines in the
section of the field which has
been reaped and harvested.
And before it is dry in the wind
—even in the golden autumn
more rice is being planted. The
soya bean is ready. The pods
are left to dry on the stalk. The
leaves are stripped and put in
the ground. And in the spaces
between the shrivelling stalks
and pods some new life is given a
start. Most Europeans would
say that the successions of plant-
ing would ruin the soil in a
decade —that it is just as impos-
sible in practical agriculture as
the Japanese transplanting of
full-size trees, which seem to
suffer no interruption of growth
when they are moved from place
to place.
Because of the close inter-
relation of life and agriculture
in Japan (which produces a
method under which food goes
from soil to mouth on the spot,
or almost so, without the huge
artificial distributing depots dhd
transport systems which have
grown up in “advanced coun-
tries” like Australia, where noth-
ing is considered eatable unless
it has passed through a State
metropolis, and where food is
sometimes transported 500 miles
from where it is grown for pro-
cessing, and then transported
back to its native soil to be
eaten) war did not cut great
supply arteries in the same
way as it did in Western coun-
tries. Also the breaking-up of the
great estates and the handing-
over of the bulk of the tenant
land to small farmers has
helped beyond doubt to stabilise
the food situation, though there
is still strict rationing.
Heavy Industry Loss
The country suffers because
the Government is compelled
to requisition a proportion
of food output a portion
large enough to prove a serious
drain on some districts in which
the season is not what it might
be—to feed the artificial city
areas. It feels the burden of
taxation, but not more than the
Australian wheatfarmer. It feels
the lack of fuel in winter. But
houses do not worry it much —
paper and cardboard and
bamboo serve for walls, and the
average idea of hoi polloi as
to what a well-dressed man
ought to wear stops short at an
old Army uniform with the
curious peaked cap with which
our troops became so familiar
in the islands. Clothes shortages
make for shabbiness, but Japan
feels the textile shortage less than
most countries. Labor disloca-
tions are a trial in some dis-
tricts where large war industries
have been liquidated, causing
large islands of temporary un-
employment which, paradoxi-
cally, are the happiest hunting-
grounds for the Communists,
who were most savage of all in
their eagerness to see war in-
dustry destroyed. But this un-
employment seems to be only
temporary.

the great cities have been wiped
out” as the measure of the effect
of the war on Japanese life pro-
duces misconception. This is
true not only generally but
startlingly even in relation to
major heavy industry.
It would be safe to say that in
heavy industry the Far Eastern
Commission has been, or pro-
poses to be, far more destructive
than the bombing, and that more
damage was wrought in certain
directions after the victory than
before it.
The U.S. emissaries who went
through many large war-factory
areas after the surrender were
not sparing with the blowlamp.
Indeed, some of their destruc-
tion of almost irreplaceable
heavy machines looks, on the
face of it, wanton and wasteful.
And the Far Eastern Commission
which decides the basic policy
of the occupation is achieving
the rest of the damage through
its system of controls.
At war peak, for instance,
Japan had an open-hearth steel-
output potential of nearly
10.000. tons, and of this
7,500,000 tons capacity is still
available despite the bombing,
while rolling-mills can handle
nearly seven-eighths of the war-
time output capacity of roughly
8.000. tons. But the Far
Eastern Commission favors re-
ducing Japanese output to a
normal level of 3,500,000 tons
of ingot steel and 2,000,000 tons
of pig-iron—figures which, if
they represent the need of Jap-
anese peace-time economy, cer-
tainly envision a permanent con-
tinuance of the country as basi-
cally living close to the soil, each
district on its local products,
supplemented by increasing im-
ports of foodstuffs as popula-
tion increases, and on a level of
conveniences far below that of
Western countries. The recom-
mendation illustrates the fact
that war industry was an ex-
crescence, a sort of fungus on
the general economy of the
country.
The Textile Recovery
If the rate of recovery in
staple industries like textiles is
any indication of the superficial
effects of war and occupation,
some rigid control will be needed
not to prevent recovery, but to
prevent world flooding.
The year after the war Japan
exported about 1,000,000 yards
of cotton cloth. In the same
year Britain exported about
514,000,000 yards. A year later
Japan exported 400,000,000
yards, showing a threefold in-
crease, while Britain’s export was
only 534,000,000 yards, or about
a 4 per cent, increase. Other
industries are not merely com-
ing, but being forced back to
heavy production at a rate which
makes the onlooker gasp. For
instance, faced with a shortage
, of silk for export the Agricul-
tural Ministry last year peremp-
torily ordered the planting of a
mere 50,000,000 mulberry trees,
so as to shoot output to the
region of 250,000 tons in, 1950.
And rayon, which was reduced
to nothing by Japanese priorities
and bombing during the war, is
recovering at a breathless rate.
The writer saw one factory in
which 6000 out of the 10,000
employees of pre-war times had
been replaced, and in which
much of the machinery was
largely of the most modern
remote-controlled type under
glass. They are making ramie
goods on a fairly large scale.
The Will to Work
One thing not wiped out in
Japan by bombing or control
was the will to work. There are
thousands of old ladies in Japan
who, single-handed, would put
whole gangs of Australian
wharfies to the blush.
Even with all the inflation, the
control and the lecturing and
interference with traditional
methods the visitor feels that
the drive is primarily due to the
Japanese themselves. You can
go out at five o’clock in the
morning and find Japanese be-
ginning to pour to work in
floods which continue to flow in
an unchecked spate for four or
five hours into the morning.
You can take a rickshaw in the
Ginza in Tokyo at nine in the
evening or range the riverside
districts, and find Japan awake
and alert and busy at its avoca-
tions while not much energy is
applied in the closely-occupied
Marunouchi district (outside
General MacArthur’s vicinity,
where there is always a smooth
activity) greater than is needed
to raise a highball 18in. from
the table and swallow slowly.
If anybody is seen idling or
moving aimlessly in working
hours he is generally a European
ir uniform. None save the
occupiers and a few privileged
entrepreneurs appear to have
time for leisured amusements.
Even when the Japanese play—
and it is normally only school-
children you see playing—they
do it with a fierce but good-
humored air of purpose.
The Conqueror’s Gift
What has conquest done to
their system which has made it
worth while from the point of
view of the conquerors?
Any occupier in or out of
uniform will answer that,
though not always , with the
same intonation: “It has given
them democracy. It is turning
them into a peaceful nation.”
What that means one has to
see Japan to understand. For
democracy there, as it is under-
stood by Socialist Governments
and their admirers, develops
along patterns strikingly in line
with those in countries which are
the donors of the magnificent
gift. In fact, it is strikingly
evident that not only in the in-
dustrial field are the Japanese
rapid learners, and just as
rapid operatives. Their version of
democratic behavior in politics
makes some of their mentors
look like unfledged amateurs.
It may not be many years be-
fore we are sorry that we have
taught them the technique. One
noticeable feature about Jap-
anese life is the seeming paucity
of men in the years between
youth and middle age. It seems
either that Japanese grow old
overnight or that the war has
cost a tremendous slice of . male
population around the . years at
which a man becomes balanced
in his outlook. The latter sup-
position is well supported by the
fact that there is now an obvious
preponderance of women. This
means that in a very few years
Japan will be entirely in the
the hands of a new population
whose memories of the war will
be sketchy, and who will have
been brought up in the tradition
of the post-war era
Looking at “democracy” in
Japan today after three years of
tutelage one shudders at the
thought of it.

“Democracy and Japan," will

PERSONAL ITEMS
Victorians have an interest in the im-
posing panel of doctors who issued the
diagnosis of the King’s health which
caused the postponement of the Royal
visit. The senior surgeon was Brigadier
Sir Thomas Dunhill, KC.V.O., C.M.G.,
sergeant-surgeon to the King since 1939.
He was schooled at Melbourne Uni.,
served in the 1914 war, was consulting
surgeon to St. Bartholomew’s in London,
and in 1928 became surgeon to H.M.’s
household. A long journey from the little
town of Tragowel (Vic.), where he was
born in 1876,
“W.E.F.”; J. H. M. Abbott (B. 24/11/’4B)
no doubt got his stalwart physique and rugged
countenance from his father, knight Joseph
Abbott, who was for 10 years Speaker in the
N.S.W. Leg. Assembly. Bora in the Hunter
Valley (N.S.W.), Abbott has always had a
strong love for his boyhood haunts; no less is
his deep appreciation for The King’s School at
Parramatta, where he was a pupil—it’s the scene
of one of his books and many of his short
stories. When a stripling John went to the
South African war as a trooper with the Ist
Australian Horse, later becoming second-lieu-
tenant in the Royal Field Artillery. Before the
Boer show he was jackeroo on an Upper
Hunter River sheep station; there he began to
write for The Bulletin, and he only ceased to
do so when his present illness forced aside his
pen. As an author of historical novels, and of
short stories of early Australian life, John has
made an important contribution to the literature
of his country. Talking to him. one feels cer-
tain that Macquarie and his circle are far more
real to him than many of his present-day acquaint-
ances. It is not unusual for John to purfctuate
some criticism of modern doings with
“I wonder what old Mac would have thought
of all this.” He knows the history of every
yard of the crooked thoroughfares that lie at the
back of Sydney’s Circular Quay, and it is said
that he used to salute a Macquarie building
when he passed one. John would have fitted
in easily in the past he describes so well.
There is a toughness and a directness about him
that would have suited Lachlan Macquarie down
to the ground. The veteran will be 74 next
Boxing Day.
From Noumea comes Jacques Francois
Barrau, probably the world’s youngest
Director of Agriculture. That’s his posi-
tion in New Caledonia at the age of 24.
With degrees in Science and Ag. Sc.
from Marseilles and Toulouse, he stands
well over 6ft., is built in proportion and
looks much older than 24, owing perhaps
to war experiences. As a Free French
officer he was in the underground until
betrayed to the Nazis. While others cap-
tured with him were shot out of hand,
Barrau was held in a concentration camp
at Compiegne until just before D-day.
He was one of 2400 Frenchmen herded
into 24 railway trucks of the type, re-
membered by Diggers, supposed to have
space for 40 hommes or 8 chevaux.
In the middle of a sweltering summer
100 men were stacked into each truck
and the doors sealed for the three-days
journey into Germany, none of the occu-
pants being allowed food or water. At
the destination 927 corpses were taken
from the trucks. Barrau spent 12 months
in the infamous Dachau, until liberated
by the Americans. Most of the time he
was a slave-laborer in the mines, when he
and others didn’t see the sun for six
months on end. Of (he 2400 Frenchmen
loaded on that tragic train to Germany
only 400 survived to return to France.
Barrau’s present rush trip is being spent
in Queensland to discuss tropical-agri-
culture problems, with departmental ex-
perts there.
Impelled by the interest in Mulga Fred
which a sheaf of contributions indicated,
The Bulletin approached Pelaco’s
managing-director, J. L. G. Law. Here
is his comment on the famous poster:
When my partner and I started in a small
way in 1907, Australian manufacturers generally
were battling to establish industries against
preference for the imported article. We looked
round for something typically Australian to
advertise the local product. I talked this over
with several friends, one of whom, “Storky”
Adams, a - Bulletin scribe, hit on the idea of
an Australian aborigine wearing only a white
~Jtft. He persuaded an artist friend, Tom
Mockendge, to submit a sketch suitable for
postering. The well-known figure resulted. But
its caption, “Made in Australia by Australians
tor Australians,” I thought overlong, and, being
a bulletin reader, substituted “Mine tinkit
they fit. In 1913 James Edmond, then
editor, visited our factory with
btorky and recorded his ‘opinion of the idea,
it I remember correctly, next to the leading
y °*J r , paper - Ido not know who
was Mockendge’s model, and doubt if he had
my impression being that Tom copied the
features from a penny postcard.
Sons of two of Australia’s naval heroes
who were lost with their ships in the
last war are keeping the family names'
alive in the R.A.N. They are Cadet D.
J. Dalton, son of Commander Dalton,
who went down in cruiser Sydney, and
Cadet J. C. Waller, whose father, the
famous Heck Waller, captained destroyer
Stuart at Matapan and had cruiser Perth
when she went. The G.-G. pinned cadet-
captain chevrons on the sons’ sleeves at
the R.A.N. College’s recent passing-out.
Another 12 months and they’ll be off to
U.K. to finish their courses and gain
commissions.
A recent speech in the House of Lords
was thrice unique: it delighted its audi-
ence, it was a maiden effort, and the
budding deliverer. Lord Maenan, is 94.
Another old-timer to distinguish himself
lately is General J. W. Moore, who be-
came commander of the United Con-
federate Veterans at their 58th reunion
m Montgomery (U.S.A.) last month. The
old boy, at 97* still drives his own car.
Carl Wilson, of the City Progressives
in Sydney’s municipal melee, is a Maori-
tender whose ship was impressed by the
British Navy in the first scrap. He spent
the rest of that war running across-
Channel to France, after which the
Enzed Navy realised its lack of small-ship
personnel and grabbed him, then in
the Reserve, to train crews of auxiliary
ships in gunnery, signals and mine-
sweeping. Running his own electrical
business in Sydney when Hitler broke
loose, one of his main jobs was produc-
ing the exploding-horns of mines laid by
our only minelayer, Bungaree. Wilson
has the energetic intelligence of the self-
made businessman, and claims plenty to
reform in Sydney, from garbage-collec-
tion to the site of Goossens’s projected
opera house. He is standing for Mac-
quarie ward.
The annual pilgriipage to poet Gordon’s
statue in Melbourne drew about 50
admirers, who found a new speaker in
Tommy White, M.H.R. His comments
were not of the nature familiar in
such, celebrations, and he had a dig
at his political opposites by comparing
their Canberra speeches to Gordon’s
ver se—-long, wandering and full of un-
familiar classical quotations.
Lambart’s sketch of Brisbane’s First
Cit. is lifelike in its impression of the
elfin keenness which, no doubt, contri-
buted to making J. B. Chandler the only
Lord Mayor to have held the northern
capital for three successive terms. First
elected in 1940, he’s had a lien on the
post since and will stand again next May.
With an ample share of the business
BRISBANE’S LUD MAYOR.
sagacity of his race—he was born in Nor-
folk, England—J.B. is a director and
chairman of a string of Queensland com-
panies, was boss of Queensland’s effort
in the Australian Comforts Fund and is
a Companion of the Institute of Radio
Engineers of Australia. The war hit him
heavily, taking two of his four sons.
With a name to fit the job. Dr. J. C.
Beaglehole, whose forte is research into
early M.L. history, has been appointed
senior research fellow and lecturer in
colonial history at Victoria College, Wel-
lington. New editions of The Voyages
of Captain Cook will be one of his first
interests.
Malcolm Ellis (The Bulletin’s “Ek Dum”),
just back ■ from a month’s tour of Japan,
has been made a Fellow of both the
Royal Historical (England) and the Royal
Australian Historical Societies for his Lachlan
Macquarie and other historical work. He is
the only man who holds both fellowships. A
1940 Prior Memorial Prize-winner, his Mac-
quarie book, published in 1946 in revised
form, gained for its author a Harbison-Higin-
b'otham Research Scholarship from Melbourne
Uni. “Old Mac,” as J. H. M. Abbott affec-
tionately refers to Macquarie in conversation,
was also the subject of the 1942 Macrossan
Memorial Lectures delivered by Ellis at Queens-
land Uni. A Queenslander, born at Narine and
schooled at Brisbane Grammar, “Ek Dum” is
the most travelled man on The Bulletin staff.
He has traversed much of Europe and Asia,
New Guinea, the South Pacific and the Northern
Territory for various newspapers (he was with
the Brisbane “Daily Mail” and Sydney “Daily
Telegraph” before joining The Bulletin) ; was
with the Special Service Squadron as the Press
Union representative in 1924; was in London
for the Imperial Conference in 1926, and had
charge of the British motor expedition from
London to Delhi in 1927. That trip resulted in
Express to Hindustan, a fine travel book reveal-
ing a good narrative style and alert observation.
It followed The Long Lead, published in 1927,
which picturesque account of a trans-Aus-
tralian journey deserves reprinting. An all-
round, well-informed writer, Ellis has also a
capacity for organisation—he was once director
“EK DUM."
of the Electrical Association of N. S. Wales—
and a genius for friendship with all sorts and
conditions of people in all sorts of places.
Apart from his Bulletin work, he is honorary
editor of the N.S.W. United Service Institu-
tion’s journal. His work as “Ek Dura” of
The Bulletin’s “The Service Man’s” pages is
known to all the Allied services, and Northern
Territorians remember how he watched Mac-
alister Blain’s interests when that M.H.R. was
a p.-0.-w. in Changi and other camps.
Melbourne will lose one of its finest
executants when pianist Jascha Spivakov-
sky takes off for Europe via New York
to meet concert engagements. Later he
will join his brother Tossy, the violinist,
and settle in America. Beginning his
career at Odessa as an infant prodigy
of six, Jascha brought the Spiva-
kovsky-Kurtz trio to Australia in 1931
and stayed with his brother as a teacher
at the Melbourne Con. Concerts they
gave later at the Town Hall were as
poorly attended as they had been crowded
when they came as overseas virtuosi,
though there was no reason to suppose
that they weren’t playing better than ever.
Subsequently Tossy went to the highest
post for an orchestral player that the
U.S. has to offer.
Another Australian who has found
honor outside his own country is Dr. A.
Carey Taylor, Professor of French at
London Uni. He has been awarded the
Medaille de la Langue Franqaise, which
rates the highest distinction the French
Academy can confer on the subject. A
Sydney Uni. man, Taylor took his
Doctorate of Literature at the Sorbonne.
Despite the awfu’ ominous ring of the
name Black Robbie and a certain Cale-
donian ruggedness of features here
recorded by Prior, the Rev. John Gray
Robertson is as much a man of peace as
his brother Red Robbie (Lt.-Gen. Robert-
son) is a man of war. Had there been a
third brother he, no doubt, would have
“BLACK ROBBIE "
completed the traditional trio by follow-
ing the law. As it was, Robbie the Black
kicked off with law and then switched to
divinity—he graduated with honors in
Arts and with honors in divinity after
a three-year theology course at Ormond
College, Melbourne Uni. At present
he is minister at Scots’ Kirk, Mosman
(N.S.W.), having been called there in
1941 after serving in the Victorian
parishes of Sorrento, Camperdown and
Elsternwick. Besides shepherding his
flock and taking a keen interest in theo-
logical education, he is chairman
and convener of the Australian Inland
Mission, and has travelled over most of
Australia in the interests of that excel-
lent organisation; in Victoria he was,
for some years, vice-president and act-
ing-chairman of the League of Nations
Union and Grand Chaplain of the Vic-
torian United Grand Lodge of Free-
masons ; he is now Grand Chaplain in
N. S. Wales. He could also, if required,
deliver a well-informed sermon on first-
grade cricket, Australian rules, tennis,
golf or bowls.
Off to U.S. to takejap a new appoint-
ment with the Defence Department in
Washington, Wing-Commander William
Townsend is the young pilot who, shot
down by a.-a. fire, in November, 1943, hid
in the New Britain jungle for three
months until rescued by an A.I.F. party
and evacuated by a Catalina. Former
commanding officer of 67 and 22
Squadrons, he was recently commanding
officer of the R.A.A.F. base at Moresby.
Into the silence:
In Scotland, at 80, Ewen George Sinclair-
Maclagan, major-general, C. 8., C.M.G., D. 5.0.,
who left the 18th Borderers at the time of
the inauguration of the Commonwealth to
become D.A.A.G. in N. S. Wales. He was
later first director of Duntroon and commanded
the 3rd Infantry Brigade and 4th Div., A.1.F.,
in World War I.
The same week Australia lost another much-
beloved soldier in Major-General Robert
Edward Jackson, C.M.G., D. 5.0., P.S.C., 64,
who retired in 1942, after holding the then
highly-important Northern and Western Com-
mands for two years.
Surgeon-Commander Bill Roberts, R.A.N.
(retired), who was in battle-cruiser Australia
in the first war and S.M.O. recruiting in the
second. Respected by all hands, he was one
of the first R.A.N. surgeons to carry out a
major operation at sea, and in retirement did
voluntary work for Sydney University and
General Hospital.
At Camberwell (Vic.), Mrs. F, W. Haddon,
widow of a former editor of the “Argus,” arid
a daughter of the Kyffin-Thomas family, of
Adelaide, who founded the South Australian
“Register.”
At Wanganui (M.L.), at 61, Stephen John
Smith, a former Administrator of the Cook
Islands. During the first World War he served
in Samoa and in the second at Trentham train-
ing camp in M.L.
At Adelaide, at 49, Jack Ham, an amateur

Women's Letters
From Sydney
Sydney felt like a pricked balloon last
week when the news of the cancellation
of the Royal Tour broke. Everyone
voiced regret over the illness of the King,
who is held so close in the affection and
esteem of his subjects. He and the
Queen, as the young Duke and Duchess
of York, made a deep impression on the
Australian people when they visited this
country long before World War II was
in the brewing. All good Australians
hope that their King will soon be well
again, and able, with the Queen and
Princess Margaret, to pay his postponed
visit to us.
The most interested spectator at
“Madame Butterfly” on its opening night
last week was Mrs. Bertie Kelly. She has
the most interesting things to tell of its
first presentation here, as a drama. She,
then Ethel Knight Mollison, was the
first Madame Butterfly Sydney saw. The
play was produced at Her Majesty’s in
1903, and Mrs. Kelly was the star of an
American dramatic company. She
reminisced to this Letter last week of
that first Australian production. She,
herself, had read no fewer than 72 books
on Japan and Japanese customs before
taking the part. She had all the Japanese
ceremonial at her finger-tips, such as
handing the visitor his cup of sake, not
directly from hand to hand, but from
her extended fan, on which the cup was
placed.
Mrs. Kelly enjoyed the singing and
the music of the present production;
enjoyed, too, the greetings in the interval
of the men and women who, like herself,
had been very young in the days when she
took Sydney by storm. One of these
was Ernest Watt, who reminded her of
the pleasure she had given him on that
first night. Another persistent theatre-
goer through the years who saw last
week’s first night of “Butterfly” was Mrs.
Sep. Levy, a slim silhouette in black and
silver in a box on the right hand of the
stage.
Mrs. Greg. McGirr brought a party
in which were the wife of N.S.W.’s
Premier James McGirr, Nonna McGirr,
and Miss Barlow, of the pleasant smile.
Patricia Walmsley’s marquisettes were
off the shoulder and full-skirted and
appliqued with delicately-toned flowers.
Goodlookers were the Jack Minnetts —
her white satin frock was caped in a
drift of white Arctic fox! A pretty girl
was Jennie Callister, white chiffon roses
circling the full skirt of her white chiffon
frock. The night was chill, and furs,
velvet wraps and an occasional quilted
Chinese jacket were noted. Maybe it
was the postponement of the Royal tour
that brought out such a crop of long
snow-white gloves.
Anyway, whatever a woman wore,
whether she sat in the gods or in a box,
she wept over the heartbreaking lot of
Madame Butterfly as portrayed in the
good singing and acting of Mercedes
Fortunati. Mrs. Walter Burfitt, dressed
in black velvet, was a prompt arrival.
She told of a performance of “Butterfly”
in Tokyo with an all-Japanese cast. It
is written up in the “American Musical
Courier,” complete with picture of the
girl who is playing lead. With Mrs. Bur-
fitt was daughter Dr. Barbara (Mrs. R. L.
McNamara), dressed in fine black lace,
very full-skirted. Palely pink as a tea-
rose were Mrs. Harald Bowden’s chiffons.
They were caped in mink.
It was a happy idea of the Australian
Wool Board to present its collection to
Sydney without benefit of parade and
cocktail. Instead the invited dropped into
a quiet suite in the Australia where, be-
tween sips of a long cool drink, suits and
frocks, the perfection of the tailoring and'
dressmaker art could be surveyed at
leisure, touched and such detail as hand-
worked buttonholes (on the Peter Russell
grey tweed) could be examined. Leading
English and French designers have built
these fabrics and garments from the back
of the Australian sheep. Here are thistle-
down woollens, as in the model with tight-
fitting bodice and swirling skirt, bright
with the bloom and stem of deep-red
roses, and the thick close weave of a
deep sapphire-blue coat of the “tent”
architecture. Peggy Allen, of London,
designed the first, Hardy Amies the
second. For dignity the Worth evening
frock of fine-wool mousseline with its
exquisite embroideries of semi-precious
stones scored high marks.
If it is possible to paint silence then
Otto Pareroultja has that gift. His paint-
ings, now being shown in Anthony
Hordern’s art gallery, carry to the gazer
a sense of refreshing stillness and calm.
The artist is, of course, an aborigine, and
there is a fine painting of his head done
by Rex Battarbee at the top of the long-
room. The rich blues, reds and purples
of the Mac Donnell Range and Janies
Range are here reproduced. Gum-trees
and their bark are depicted with fond
pare. To see No. 22, “Rock Hole Creek,”
is alone worth the tram journey and the
long trek through the carpet department.
When many of the present opera
season’s audience first saw “Tosca,”
World War I had just slipped behind the
horizon. Since then World War II
brought a sharp reminder that torture of
prisoners, concentration camps and
Gestapo could still be ruthlessly em-
ployed by one set of human beings
against another. Therefore the “Tosca”
of Saturday night gained in intensity as
far as women in the Tivdli audience were
concerned. No longer did Scarpia, Chief
of Police, and the torture of Tosca’s lover
seem some legend of the dark ages. From
the moment Tosca, very tall and regal in
her pale- and deep-lilac directoire dress
and jacket, her sweeping picture-hat, her
tall directoire cane, swept on to the stage,
the audience was hers.
All Sydney regular theatregoers were
there, the women in a complete change of
raiment. Admired were Mrs. Florence
Taylor’s furs and black silk taffetas, Ricki
Doherty’s plum-yellow moires, the skirt
swept back to a huge bustle bow, Mrs.
Charles Lloyd Jones’s soft-white crepes
served with platina-fox, Mrs. Marcel
Dekyvere’s lilac-pink tulles, Major
Grant’s dazzling decorations. Two pretty
sisters seen at first-nights are Mrs. Max
Munro and Margaret Salenger. Last
Saturday Margaret’s full-skirted frock
was of parchment taffeta on which great
bronze butterflies rfested.
Tomorrow night, if you have not been
already, you must go to the Conserva-
torium to applaud Margaret Kerr, the
pretty subject of this picture. She is the
Louise of the present Conservatorium
opera season. If you miss out tomorrow,
there' are other performances dated for
Saturday night and Tuesday and Thurs-
day of next week. There is a splendid
cast with really good-quality Australian
voices. Eugene Goossens and Florent
Hoogstoel conduct on alternate nights,
and Hilda Mulligan and Julien Gerardy
are the joint producers. All performances
commence at a quarter to eight.
Graceful and gracious Mrs. Irene
Vivers has returned to Sydney, after a
number of years spent in Kenya and
South Africa. She returned in the Orion,
and is staying at the Australia, where her
room becomes more like a horticultural
show every day. Since she left Australia
Mrs. Vivers has, in addition to South
Africa, seen most of Europe. Whenever
she can emerge from a snowdrift of invi-
tations the returned traveller seeks a flat
—a service one for preference.
On December 15, Janet, only daughter
of the Lewis A. Hamiltons, of Ravens-
w©od, Rylstone, will be married to lan
Robert, son of Mr. and Mrs. George
Officer, of Kilmorey, Warrnambool,
Victoria, at St. Stephen’s Church, Mac-
quarie-street. Reception will follow at
the Wentworth.
No less a writer than Sacheverell Sit-
well has written a foreword to the cata-
logue introducing the Ascher scarves to
Sydney buyers. These scarves are being
shown as works of art —as indeed they
are —in David Jones’s Gallery. English,
French and Spanish artists have contri-
buted the drawings reproduced in these
Ascher textiles. They are not cheap, but
if you have six and a half guineas, you
could buy the somewhat romantic Pas
de deux by Christian Berard, and know
that only 599 other women in the world
could have the same. For these scarves
come in limited editions. Some of the
nine-guinea ones, such as Henri Matisse,
have been reproduced only 275 times.
Firefly, Moss Rose and Combat de Coqs
are this Letter’s choice.
Grand sight of Saturday afternoon was
the parade of 600 V.As. in the outer
grounds of Government House. Lieut.-
General John Northcott took the salute,
and afterwards presented 30 of the V.As.
with the King’s Bar brooch. This re-
presents 10 or more years of active
voluntary service. Turramurra detach-
ment won the Wilfrid Johnson Cup for
all-round efficiency. The Commandants
gave a tea-party in a large marquee fol-
lowing the parade. There was another
tea-party for official guests in Govern-
ment House. Mrs. Persia Porter led the
parade.
From Melbourne
The National Theatre Movement’s
presentation at the Princess of its second
offering, Smetana’s “Bartered Bride,”
brought the tribute to young Aus-
tralian singers of the flattering “House
Full” sign. Among the opera-lovers
was Mrs. Garnet Carroll in a
powder-blue crepe dinner frock which
had sprays of flowers in glittering crystal
beads on the bodice. Irene Mitchell’s
black crepe gown with its jet-bead
embroideries was worn with silver-fox
furs. The draped bodice of Margot
Henry’s floral satin frock was in the off-
the-shoulder style. Trixie Johnson’s bal-
lerina frock was of black silk jersey.
Minnie Reidy, who is doing the publicity
work for the N.T.M., was in pastel-blue
slipper - satin. Mrs. Hume Cook’s
cinnamon-brown taffeta gown was worn
with an ermine cape.
The Toorak Presbyterian Church was
the setting for the marriage of Margaret
Elizabeth (Peggy), elder daughter of Lady
Fraser, of Whernside, Toorak, and the
late Sir Colin Fraser. Bridegroom was
Henry Vasey, only son of Mrs. Casson,
of London, and the late Mr. John Lees
Casson. The bride’s trained gown of
cream satin had a long-sleeved bodice
heavily embroidered with seed pearls; a
long veil of filmy tulle flowed from a
coronet of orange blossom; her bouquet
was of cream-toned orchids and
gardenias. She was given away by Sir
Alex Stewart; her sister, Mrs. Thomas
Scott Cree,,was matron-of-honor, and her
five-year-old niece Janet was flower-girl.
Mrs. Scott Cree’s frock of taffeta in a
pale-gold toning had a bouffant skirt;
the softly-feathered hat was in gold ton-
ings, and gold roses formed her bouquet.
Janet wore a frock of floral muslin over
taffeta, the garland of field flowers in her
hair matching her posy. L. B. Robinson
was best man. The Rev. A. C. Watson
officiated. Over 200 guests were later
entertained by Lady Fraser at Whernside.
The latest monthly luncheon of the In-
ternational Club of Victoria had as its
guest-speaker D. N. Kherdekar, an Indian
student who is doing an agricultural
course at Melbourne ’Varsity. His sub-
jects ranged from conditions of life in
India to its architecture, philosophy and
religions. President of the club, Mrs.
Herbert Brookes, had as her guest Maysie
Law, whose work with the Y.W.C.A.
took her to India for some years.
Mrs. Frank Walters, a busy member of
the United Nations Organisation, is the
mother of two schoolgirl daughters,
Dorothy and Astrid. A keen art lover,
she is noted for her smart dressing. She
leaves soon for England and America.
Before coming to Australia, the Walters
family lived for some years in New York.
In the big gardens of Mr. and Mrs.
A. G. Staley’s Brighton home colored
lights gleamed from tree-tops, a dance-
floor was set on the lawn, and the sort
strains of Hawaiian music mingled with
the murmur of the sea this was the
setting for the party organised to further
the candidature of Miss Australia entrants
Charmaine Carvell-Clarke and Margaret
Reed. Mrs. Staley’s black crepe frock
had a soft beige lace yoke; her small
pink straw hat was trimmed with pastel-
blue roses. Her elder daughter, Mrs. B.
O’Connor, wore a deep midnight-blue
crepe ballerina frock; younger daughter
Valerie was in light beige crepes. Judy
Gainford, last year’s Miss Australia, was
guest-tff-honor; she wore a bouffant
black velvet ballerina frock. Margaret
Woolford, another candidate in the Quest,
put black taffeta over black net. A
guipure lace collar lent neat embellish-
ment to Elizabeth Taylor’s off-white linen
jacket-suit. Mrs. W. H. McKechnie’s
dove-grey crepe frock had a deep lace
hem ; with it she wore a silver-fox cape.
Mrs. Margaret Saker, who organised the
party, wore an aqua-blue jacket-suit.
At the Royal Victorian Institute for
the Blind’s two-day fair which she opened
at the Town Hall, the Lady Mayoress,
Mrs. J. S. Disney, presented a prize, the
gift of Mr. Tutton, wife of the president
of auxiliaries, to the Blackburn auxiliary
for the most original stall. This stall,
which was selling children’s toys, was
built to represent a house, with Santa
Claus dropping gifts down the chimney.
Later, accompanied by Mrs. Tutton, the
Lady Mayoress made a tour of the stalls,
and was unstinting in her praise for the
helpers who had given so much of their
time and energy for this excellent cause.
A warm, sunny day at Moonee Valley
brought out a rash of midsummer
flimsiness, with silks and light linens pre-
dominating. Olive Rosenthal’s white
sharkskin suit with its gold button trim-
mings was worn with a white straw
crownless hat tied under the chin with
navy veiling. Mrs. Jim Buchanan com-
bined soft leaf-green silk tailored frock
and large natural-straw hat garlanded
with spring flowers. With her beige
jacket-suit, which showed the nipped-in
waistline, Mrs. Maurice Nathan wore a
large white straw feather-trimmed haf.-*
Mrs. J. BoWen Pain trimmed her small
beige straw hat with one gold-toned rose ;
her bolero suit was beige-toned. A red-
and-white-patterned silk frock was the
choice of Mrs. W. H. Cornfoot, whose
large white straw hat had navy taffeta
bows for trimming. Wyn Kellow's
brown-and-white-silk-patterned frock had
a full, pleated skirt; her white hat was
simply trimmed with brown veiling. Mrs.
S. Stuff’s navy-and-white-patterned frock
was worn with a navy-trimmed white hat.
Mrs. W.. McDermott’s tailored suit was
of black silk, her hat of duck-egg-green
grosgrain. With her white-crowned black
hat, which had a black veil spotted in
white, Mrs. J. S. Disney wore a black silk
ensemble.
At the luncheon which the Lady
Mayoress, Mrs. J. S. Disney, gave to
women journalists at the Town Hall,
bowls of lovely water-lilies were set on the
long table. The hostess’s olive-green
jacket-suit was worn with a “Roof of
Paris” black straw hat. Among other
guests were Lady Wales, in a navy en-
semble; Mrs. Cecil Thomson, in grey
floral full-skirted frock and off-the-face
grey straw hat; Mrs. B. Parsons, grey
tailored suit topped with a small black
halo hat; and Doreen Parsons, in black
frock and small black halo hat.
Yvonne and Pat Whittam, two young
milliners, put on one of the best fashion
shows of the season when they presented
many lovely and original hats at the
Women Services Club to assist club funds
and the Food for Britain Appeal. Small
boaters, cloches, half-hats for cocktail
and evening wear, bonnet berets_ and
large hats were featured. One black
picture-hat had a brim of lace crinoline
straw which, when removed, left the gold
sequin-spangled black velvet crown as a
tiny skull-cap, suitable for theatre wear.
Field flowers were used in profusion to
trim many toast-toned straws, and one
half-hat of blue straw had a black velvet
crown, and was trimmed with a cluster of
pink and blue roses. Very attractive were
the white picture hats of straw ; one had
lily-of-the-valley under the upswept brim ;
the wide brim of another in
white daisies. The hats were modelled by
Joyce O’Neill and two “Miss Australia”
candidates, Charmaine Clark and
Margaret Kerr. The club’s president,
Mrs. I. Tratham, thanked all those who
had organised and assisted with the func-
tion. Members of the committee included
Mary McLean, Miriel Cheney, Peg
Dwyer and Molly Carey.
Lady Grey Egerton, who returns
shortly to her London home, was hostess
at an afternoon party at the Hotel Wind-
sor. Pastel-tinted rhododendrons, gladioli,
lilies and roses comprised the decorations.
The blush-pink roses in the hostess’s
black frock matched those on her small
black hat. Her daughter, Mrs. Reginald
Power, added to her black ensemble a
wide-brimmed black hat banded with
white grosgrain ; her granddaughter, Mrs.
Geoffrey Whitehead, effected contrast to
her snuff-brown linen dress with a large
natural straw hat carrying snuff-toned
veiling. Mrs. George Armstrong wore a
coolie-type natural straw hat with her
lily-of-the-valley green-wool jacket-suit;
her daughter, Mrs. Pamela Vestey, com-
bined a grey pleated jacket-suit and pink
straw quilled beret. Mrs. W. L. Russell
Clarke wore a beige-wool jacket-suit and
black straw picture-hat. Lady Knox was
in black ensemble and wide-brimmed
black straw hat. A floral hat gave the
necessary “lift” to Mrs. Stanhope Winter-
Irving’s blue-and-grey-patterned silk,
frock.

Between them Tooths and Tooheys
share all but a small fraction of the beer
trade in N. S. Wales, Tooths taking the
lion’s portion. The co. began to buy up
large and thirsty areas of the trade fol-
lowing World War I. In 1920 Castle-
maine and Wood Bros. (Newcastle) was
taken over, Mahon (Wagga) and Lincoln
(Narrandera) were absorbed in 1924, and
five years later Reschs’ business (then
one of the two other big Sydney brew-
eries) was welded into the organisation.
Meanwhile paid capital (£900,000 in
1910) had grown to £5,620,598, of which
£2,150,097 had come from reserves. The
figure increased to £6,182,657 by par
issues in 1936, and has remained steady
since.
During the decade to end Sept., 1939,
£1,954,040 net was added to the book-
value of hotel properties and other fixed
assets, thus further widening and anchor-
ing turnover. During the war and post-
war years steadily increasing returns from
expanding beer consumption took care of
mounting costs, including lifts in excise.
Since 1939 excise has stepped up from
Is. 9d. to 4s. 7d. a gallon, which means
that the Government now makes off with
14s. 7d. of every pound the brewer re-
ceives for bulk'beer. The other ss, sd.
has to cover increased production and
distribution costs, as well as profits, which
are twice taxed, first as co. earnings and
then as dividends in the hands of share-
holders. Beer consumption per head of
population in Australia rose from 10.34
gallons in 1936-37 to 13.45 gallons, in
1945-46, and then shot up to 15,94 gal-
lons in 1946-47. Excise collections sug-
gest that the figure eased a trifle for
the year to June 30, 1948.
Last term a strike at the co.’s brewery
affected production and deliveries for a
while; hops were scarce and dear, and
some were imported ; the price of sugar,
barley and other brewing ingredients rose,
too, and so did the basic wage and mar-
gins for skill, and the 40-hour week
further aggravated the co.’s troubles.
Still, Tooths, which has never overstated
the position in the past, managed to show
£31,776 more profit, and also disclosed
£2,204,862 of inner reserves.
After providing £127,845 (up £243) for
depreciation, and making unspecified
allowances for bad and doubtful debts
and other contingencies, gross earnings
stepped up £70,563:

Though exes, took £38,787 of the gain,
they were approximately 6s. p.c. lighter.
Abolition of War-time (Co.) Tax helped
to offset the impact of other cost factors
already referred to. The net result was
14.8 p.c. on capital as against 14.3, 13.9,
13.8, 13.5, 12.7 and 12.3 p.c. back to
1942. The div,, which had advanced
from 12 p.c. in 1943 to 13 p.c. in 1944
and to 131 P-c. in 1947, was lifted to 141
p.c., the final being at the rate of 15
p.c. p.a., maintenance of which will call
for £11,106 more profit than was claimed
last term.
The £1,861,192 of obsolescence and
contingency reserves disclosed had been
“built up over a long period to pro-
vide for replacement of breweries, pro-
perties and plant.” The £343,670 of
other inner reserves brought to light came
from accumulations “taken over on tin
amalgamation with Castlemaine and
Wood Bros, and Reschs.” The curtain
remained drawn over Reschs’ figures, but
the first-mentioned co. showed reserves
of £226,822, subject to £20,000 of good-
will, when taken over. So there are
good reasons to believe that the cupboard
where inner reserves are kept is far from
bare.
When materials and labor become
available the rebuilding, remodelling and
extension of brewery and hotel proper-
ties will call for considerable outlay. But
it is unlikely that shareholders will be
asked to assist:

War reduced to a trickle the large flow

France and Germany. Now Germany is
out of the field, and post-war exchange,
economic and other difficulties have stood
in the way of revival of this trade, while
demand, in both local and near-by ex-
port markets, has increased considerably.
D.H.A. and its group of 10 operating
subsidiaries, scattered throughout all the
Australian States, have lost no time in
taking advantage of these new opportuni-
ties, though their efforts have been
hampered by shortages, controls and
transport and other difficulties, including
disturbed conditions in Asia, Output in
the pharmaceutical, light chemical and
other fields has been increased substan-
tially, and many lines previously imported
are now made from Australian raw
materials, thanks to energetic and effi-
cient research. The co. is now one of
the world’s major suppliers of hyoscine
and atropine. Two subsidiaries specially
formed for the purpose look after the
recently developed export side of the busi-
ness, of which much is expected when
conditions become more settled, provided
costs outside the management’s control
don’t get out of hand.
Profitable employment was quickly
found for the new share capital (£314,531)
and premium money (£117,949) gathered
during the June half of 1947. Sales by
all sections in the group increased last
term, and there was a lift in selling prices.
All this, and what looks like good buy-
ing, together with abolition of War-time
(Co.) Tax, more than offset the steep rise
in operating, distributing and selling costs.
The net result was £41,192 stronger at
£255,629. That was after deducting out-
side interests, allowing £77,652 (up
£8735) for depreciation and something
for taxation. It also leaves out of the
reckoning a profit of £12,468 on sale of
some fixed assets, and an unexplained
addition of £61,871 to reserves. The
£255,629 of trading profit, best yet,
covered pref. requirements and 8.8 p.c.
on the £2,830,775 of ord. capital, com-
pared with 8.1, 7.2, 7,7, 7.1 and 7.1 p.c.
back to 1942. The div. was kept at
p.c.; it had been steady at 6} p.c.,
sweetened with a li p.c. victory bonus in
1945, for the decade to end June, 1946.
The £1,152,178 of reserves are labelled
nominal because they are subject to
£1,111,816 of intangibles goodwill
(£320,602) and excess cost (£791,214) of
inter-co. holdings over their par value.
Shortage of labor and scarcity of
materials, etc., have hampered progress
with the big development programme—it
includes erection of new laboratories at
Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth
and of new warehouses and offices at
Sydqey, Melbourne, Hobart and Ade-
laide. Net addition to the book-value of
freeholds and plant last term was
£34,409:

The bigger trading and preparation for
further growth are reflected in additions
of £440,585 to stocks and £143,145 to
book debts. The group leant upon
sundry creditors, etc. (up £411,753) for
most of the money. The more-or-less
liquid surplus (£2,187,496) improved by
£140,737.
To help lighten the debt and provide
for further expansion 474,225 new £1
ords. were issued, one for six at a pre-
mium of 12s. 6d. each, in July last. When
all the money on that lot is in, paid
capital will be £3,405,000 in 100,000 6
p.c. cum. prefs. and 3,305,000 ords., and
reserves will benefit by £296,390 of share

the ords, will then call for £537,350, or
£18,270 less profit than was claimed last
term.
At 425. the ords. return 3.3 p.c. on a
7 p.c. div. basis, or 3.8 p.c. on an 8 p.c.

Actual beer-making is in the hands of
Tasmanian Breweries Pty., in which
Cascade and J. Boag and Son merged
this part of their activities on a 50-50
basis as far back as 1922.. Cascade it-
self concentrates on dispensing the brew
through its hotels, and on manufacturing
cordials, cider, etc.; and the soft stuff
has responded nicely to capital outlay
in connection therewith. A small wine-
and-spirit offshoot, Traders Pty., also
contributes to the pool. A new sub-
sidiary, Cascade Fruit Products Pty., was
set up last term and is expected to give
a satisfactory account of itself. In addi-
tion to supplying the cordial factory with
fruit juices, its products have already been
marketed on the mainland and in U.K.
The curtain is kept drawn over the
brewing co.’s figures, and the board is
tight-lipped about its earnings and dis-
tributions. Last term the shortage of
bottles and scarcity of some raw materials
hampered local sales and stood in the
way of revival of inter-State and over-
seas agencies, and costs rose sharply.
Still, population increase, following expan-
sion of industrial activity in the island,
and growth of tourist traffic helped to
maintain a steady upward pressure on
sales in all sections of the business. And,
to keep abreast of technical developments
and so help ease the pressure on
costs, a new bottling plant is now being
installed at the brewery, and another one
is about to be installed at the cordial
factory.
Gross earnings from all sources
(£88,421) were £2370 stronger. In-
cluding something for depreciation and
taxation, exes. (£44,561) made off with
£1243 of the increase. The net result
(£43,860, up £1127, second-best in the
co.’s history) was an attractive 19.4 p.c.
on capital as against 18.9, 19.8, 18.4,
17.5, 16, 13.6 and 12.5 p.c. back to 1941.
The div; remained steady at 12 p.p., and
has done so since 1938.
Some of the hotel properties are to
be rebuilt, and others remodelled, when
labor and materials become available.
Since the policy is to reduce hotel pro-
perties, or most of them, to land value,
the board wrote £6970 off the book-value
of freeholds, in addition to the ordinary
allowance for depreciation, making the
total written off in this way £57,866 over
the last 11 years. Last term £19,474
more was spent on hotels than was
written off:

The increase of £15,000 in shareholdings
reflects formation of the new subsidiary
already referred to. Including provision
for taxation, outside liabilities exceeded
more or less liquids by £343 when the
books closed.
The market likes the co.’s prospects
and prices the 21s. shares paid to 20s,
each at 635. 3d. —the figure has been
fairly steady around that level for the
last 12 months. The return at 635. 3d.

Despite steady expansion of the volume
of business placed in the expert care of
these trustee cos., their net earning-
power has lost some of its former
strength. That is because the growth
in costs has been proportionately
greater than the growth in gross
earnings. Corpus and commission
charges, anchored by legislation, have re-
mained moderate and unchanged since
the closing decades of last century; but
costs have been lifted rapidly to new
high levels by war and post-war inflation,
taxation and a maze of socialistic and
other legislation that has increased
greatly work connected with administra-
tion of estates. At the same time
financial controls have kept returns
from investment of the co.’s own funds


High Money Incomes
But Less Comfort
Staff opposed to Nationalization
—says Bank Chairman
PRACTICALLY everyone Is feeling the sting
of high prices more sharply as the months
go by, and, though the great bulk of people
are earning, on average, more money than
ever before, they experience no proportionate
improvement in their standard of life. Hours
of work may be shorter, but the facilities and
services necessary for comfortable pleasure*
and recreation are miserably inadequate. Our
post-war economy seems to have a bias toward
higher and higher monetary incomes, with poorer
and poorer results when we spend them, said
said the chairman of The National Bank of
A/osia Ltd. (Mr. H. D. Giddy) at the annual
meeting of shareholders, held in Melbourne
yesterday.

that the trustee section of the

the prospect are given. Ore-
bodies carrying erratically dis-
tributed gold occur in this area
in the form of irregularly shaped

formation. They do not lend
themselves to the conventional

SUNDRY SHOWS
ELAINE HAXIOM.
Paintings by Elaine Haxton,
at the Macquarie Galleries,
Sydney, are, in the main, whim-
sical, delicate and meaningless
decorations. Apart from the
“Abstracts,” “Man in the
Moon,” “Baby Sitting” and
“Pacific Symbols,” there are oil
paintings with a repetition, in
various settings, of a blank,
childish face. In “Trick Hat” it
is a child, adorned with a pro-
peller-like headpiece ; in “Sum-
mer Time” a young lady with
bare feet drinking a milk-shade
or an ice-cream soda has the
dominant expression of inquir-
ing simplicity. “Afternoon
Tea, New York Fashion” de-
picts a lady tete-a-tete with a
comparatively intelligent-looking
poodle. And “Strange Chil-
dren,” which was bought by the
Director for the N.S.W.
National Art Gallery, is a group
of blank - faced, duckfooted
children, solemnly holding um-
brellas.
The virtue of the design is its
simplicity. It can conveniently
express—with a little imagina-
tive co-operation from the be-
holder—a whole battery of
emotions. And in its economy
of line it is irresistibly remini-
scent of the caricature which
symbolised inquiring eyes and
a nose peering over a fence, fol-
lowed by the caption “Wot, no
something-or-other?” which was
once a common sight, wherever
people had a piece of chalk and
a wall on which to express their
wit and artistic fancy.
Elaine Haxton has, too, paint-
ings and buildings in the pre-
vailing fashion, including “Coun-
try Bank, North Queensland,”
which shows poorly-clad child-
ren embracing what looks like a
watermelon outside a tin shack
surrounded by palms; and
“Barber’s Shop, East Side,”
which is gaudy and slightly un-
real, like a Saroyan short story
translated into decor.
But “The Phoenix,” a large oil
of tfie familiar Australian
country pub—which, inciden-
tally, is becoming a much more
popular, but less beautiful,
symbol of the Australian coun-
tryside than the gum-tree—has
life and character. It shows the
hotel with conventional red ver-
andah-posts and has two goats
standing beneath them, staring
inquiringly towards the invisible
bar. Behind them is a street
with small houses with red and
blue roofs, paling fences and
flowering shrubs, gay masses of
color in the empty street. In
the background there are bare
hillocks —sandhills, perhaps, or
clay mullock-heaps—and a wide
sweep of greasy sky. Despite
this last deficiency the picture is
lively, convincing and, unlike
most of its species, it has life in
the isolation. In its humor,
realism and rough fidelity it sug-
gests a James Hackston short
story. What is needed is a
touch of poetry —a perfect blue
sky, for instance —to give the
prose validity and balance.
"Tosca" and
"Butterfly."
“Madame Butterfly” and
“Tosca” (reviewed here B.
25/8/’4B) followed “Aida” at
Sydney Tiv. last week. There is
something so irresistibly comic
about the melodramatics of both
—particularly as interpreted by
florid Italian dramatics —that
one is torn between appre-
ciation of the singing and a
belly-laugh at the rest.
When, for instance, Mercedes
Fortunati plonks her infant on
a cushion in the middle of the
stage, blindfolds him, gives him
an American flag to wave in
each hand and then, with a fine
flourish, plunges a knife into her
bosom, the whole business be-
comes . so farcical and vastly
amusing that one is inclined to
forget that the same lady has
been singing superbly for three
acts. Under the same circum-
stances it is easy to forget the
excellent foundations laid by the
singing and acting of Aldo Fer-
racuti as Pinkerton and Leo
Piccioli as a very natural and
convincing Sharpless.
There is a tradition, or per-
haps an excuse, that one goes to
the opera for the music alone,
but even conceding that neces-
sity, surely it would be better to
understate the histrionics than
to exaggerate them —to diminish
rather than magnify the weak-
nesses. That exaggeration, too,
is, of course, traditional, par-
ticularly with the Italian school,
but there is no more justification
for it than there was for the
convention that permitted 14-
stone divas to declaim that they
were dying of consumption.
“Tosca” was more convincing
than “Butterfly” in the current
season, but it, too, suffered from
a certain amount of unintended
comedy with the lecherous
Scarpia clutching and clawing
and gesticulating around the
sofa after the hapless and
hysterical heroine. Still, as
Scarpia, Mario Basiola flung out
a wide, deep baritone that
atoned for much, while Ger-
mana di Giulio’s' soprano
throbbed and rose and fell mag-
nificently through the passions
and fears of the luckless Tosca.
Alvino Misciano’s Cavara-
dossi was a bit thin, both
vocally and histrionically, but
he painted, loved and met the
final bullet with a generally
smooth performance. The
orchestra paced its way nicely,
except on one or two occasions
when, in bursts of furious en-
thusiasm, it drowned the singers
in a torrent of music.
"The Bartered Bride."
Melbourne has had towait for
82 years and the National
Theatre Movement at the Prin-
cess for this opera of Smetana’s,
and it was delightful—good by
any standards. The cheerful line
of Smetana’s jolly music was
maintained by guest conductor
Hans Zander with a light touch
that never mauled the singers.
The singing, generally, was
crisp and the choruses much
more ample than in the com-
mercial theatre.
Nobody was easier than
Laurence Lott, as Jenik, the rich
peasant’s son sells his girl-
friend to the marriage-broker for
300 dollars and gets her back
with a fortune. James Wilson’s
marriage-broker was a master-
piece of comic characterisation.
Betna Pontin sang sweetly
and acted merrily as the bartered
bride, and the village ballets
were excellently handled, as was
the village show, with its clowns,
its strongman and its perform-
ing bear —these interludes in
opera are generally boring, but
this one matched the gaiety of
the music. If the crowds don’t
throng this show at the Prin-
cess as they thronged the Italian
show at His Majesty’s there is a
lot of snobbery in Melbourne’s
musical appreciation.
"Frieda."
There is a humanity about
this play by Ronald Miller
which one doesn’t usually see in
plays dealing with post-war
problems. Frieda is an extremely
pretty German nurse who helped
a British airman, Robert Daw-
son, to escape from a p.-0.-w.
camp at the risk of her own
life, while he married her ac-
cording to Protestant rites to en-
able her to escape from Europe.
They arrive at the Catholic
Dawson home in southern Eng-
land, which has seen more of
German raiders than any other
section, and the family is im-
mediately thrown into a crisis.
Mrs. Mary Dawson, whose
husband was killed in World
War I, her sister -in - law,
Eleanor Dawson, who is stand-
ing for Parliament on the anti-
German ticket, Mrs. Judy IDaw-
son, whose husband was killed
in World War 11, and Tom
Merrick, a soldier who bears the
marks of Nazi bashings, all take
different attitudes towards her,
Richard Mansfield, Frieda’s
brother, turns up in the uniform
of a Polish soldier. He is in-
stantly recognised by Merrick as
the Nazi who bashed him.
In the meantime Robert has
discovered that he is in love with
Frieda, and is about to marry
her again according to the rites
of his church. Eleanor has be-
come an M.P. pleading the
theory that there is something
inherently bad in the German
nation and that every individual
partakes of the essence of this
nation. When Robert learns
that his wife concealed the
Nazism of her brother he is con-
verted to this theory.
The play was admirably pre-
sented by Melbourne Little
Theatre. Murielle Hearne
was as rigidly anti-Nazi as
Joseph Lipton was solemnly
and stiffly one of Hitler’s
children. Stewart Ginn was the
ebullient husband who effer-
vesces so easily along the lines
of his feelings, and Wynn Dare
made an appealing and pathetic
Frieda.
"Louise."
The Sydney Conservatorium
Opera School’s presentation of
Charpentier’s opera “Louise,”
with the scenes alternating be-
tween Montmartre and a
Parisian working-class suburb,
was smoothly produced and
marked by a generally high
standard of singing by the prin-
cipals,
Margaret Kerr in the title role
was outstanding, her singing of
“Ever Since the Day,” the only
real aria in the opera, being in-
vested with exactly the right
degree of joyous rapture. His-
trionically she was also com-
pletely convincing. Iris Moxley
overcame initial nervousness to
give a good account of herself
as the waspish mother; David
Barwell used a resonant bass-
baritone with fine judgment as
the father, although he was too
melodramatic in the final act —
less staginess in his gestures
would be an improvement. Bar-
well and Miss Moxley also did
too much direct-gazing at con-
ductor Eugene Goossens for
their entry-cues.
Geoffrey Moore was adequate
as the artist Julian. Choruses
were first-rate, in particular the
scene in the dressmaking work-
room being carried through with
splendid elan by the girls.
Musica Viva.
Grillparzer’s simple epitaph to
Schubert; “Music has buried
here a rich treasure, but fairer
hopes,” gains greatest point when
one considers the composer’s

SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
One would have thought the reduced
opportunities in recent years with the
elimination of mid-week racing would
have led to an automatic weeding-out
of fourth-rate animals and a general
improvement of quality. To the con-
trary, however, there seem to be
more horses than ever in training in
metropolitan areas, and more poor
stuff among them. Of course, the
recent, though now shrinking, abun-
dance of easily-made ready cash has
brought scores of new owners into
the ’ game; some of them wouldn’t
know a Shetland pony from a Clydes-
dale, but blissfully fork out a steady
fiver a week for the upkeep of
animals whieh would be hard pressed
to beat either.
At intervals the S.T.C. puts on
first-class meetings, in season; be-
tween times its programmes cater
specially for the second-raters. Satur-
day’s card of nine races at Canterbury
included two fixed-weight affairs for
maiden two-year-olds and four Mixed
Stakes. Those races between them
attracted 225 entries and 109 actual
starters. By contrast, there were 10
starters in the Flying and five in the
11.-furlongs November Handicap. Of
the total of 136 horses that started
at'Canterbury, 77 were maidens and
a further 32 eligible for restricted
company—figures which say some-
thing for the optimism of some
owners.
However, Ijarge fields, contesting
mainly sprint distances, make for
exciting racing, and the weather on
Saturday was delightful. to
show that optimism goes not always
unrewarded, the 11-furlongs Campsie
Mixed went to the six-year-old maiden
King Lear, who had his first race in
January, 1945, when the S.T.C. was
very young and Mixed Stakes had not
even been thought of.
When betting opened on the second
Maiden Nursery most bookmakers’
boards showed odds of 4 to 1 against
the Brueghel colt Delineate. The
sort of small punters who “follow
the money’’ (without realising that
it’s often just their own money they’re
following) pushed to back the colt,
which eventually started favorite at 7
to 4. Delineate had not previously
raced, had shaped poorly in a barrier
trial and, in accord with that form,
finished ninth in the Nursery. One
of the beauties of having the totalisa-
tor as the sole medium of betting,
as it is in many countries and should
be here, is that the machine returns
odds strictly in proportion to the
weight of money for each horse, and
it neither heeds nor breeds rumors.
The most interesting, or at least
most publicised, exhibit at Canterbury
was the four-year-old horse Otairi,
claimed by his owner and breeder J.
Bach, of Queensland, to be a son of
Bernborpugh. The authorities refused
to register the animal as being of
that breeding, and would not allow
him to be named Mr. Bernie. How-
ever, J. R. Taylor, a Queensland
Parliamentarian, was given permission
to lease the horse," whose breeding
appears in the racebooks as by an
unidentified sire from Miss Shirley.
At his first start a few weeks
back, Otairi won a Maiden at Ipswich
(Q.), and was then taken, to Sydney.
Winning Saturday’s second Ashbury
Mixed in reasonably good style, he
beat Caruso, owned, ironically, by
Romano and carrying Bemborough’s
colors.
The Flying went to Hava Chat
(R. Pearse), starting at the surpris-
ingly good odds of 33 to 1. After
a brief let-up he looked ra shade
above hijnself but should be at peak-
form for the Villiers, The ••aged
Enfield gelding Codicil (F. Williams)
proved the best of a poor bunch con-
testing the November Handicap.
* * * *
The Dhoti colt Amritsar, due to
have run in the Somerton Handi-
cap at Moonee Valley on Saturday,
was found on arrival at the course
to be in a highly-excited state sugges-
tive of doping. Trainer R. Sinclair and
the colt’s part-owner E. A. Under-
wood at once notified the stewards,
who ordered withdrawal from the
race and had a swab taken. An
inquiry was opened,' and adjourned
pending the analyst’s report on the
swab.
Adoption of American practice
would much strengthen the hand of
authorities in dealing with doping in
Australia. Here the most the nobbier
has to fear is a life-disqualification.
In America race clubs impose a term
of disqualification and also lay in-
formation with the police, who take
action under American narcotic laws;
the dopester frequently finds himself
not only warned off but also footing
a heavy fine and doing a spot of time
—an effective deterrent.
Amritsar would have been well sup-
ported in the Somerton, a mile race
for three-year-olds, but, in his
absence, punters went hot and strong
for the Caulfield winner French Pact.
Starting at 9 to 4, French Pact gave
supporters a good sight, but the Dhoti
colt Poona (D. Barclay) had the
favorite’s measure over the final
quarter-mile.
Another last-start-winner to cost
punters dear was the Tuhitarata colt
Macshaw. In the face of his record-
breaking run at Caulfield, he started
“Come on, Ben —We cant stop looking at the view
ALL day!"
at odds-on in the Glenbervie Plate
for two-year-old colts and geldings,
and was beaten very easily by Regal
Scout (G. Nichols), a Kinderscout
colt who looks a likely customer. The
Moreland Stakes for two-year-old
fillies went to the aptly-named Rover s
Mark (L. Lott), a daughter of Foot-
mark-Waltzing Matilda. Runner-up
in- the Moreland, Zezette looks sure
to make amends shortly. In one sense
at any rate Zezette belongs to select
company; of the approximately 13,000
horses listed in the latest edition of
the “Australasian Turf Register,” just
26 are to be found under the letter
“Z.”
Though getting a trifle long in the
tooth, Sydney-owned Good Idea
proved a shade too good for Few
Words and Gayness over the 13
furlongs of the Bulla’ Handicap. Good
Idea started favorite and, ridden a
perfect race by W. Williamson, scored
by a head. Other Moonee Valley
winners were Fine Fettle (J. Gilmore)
accounting for Tea Cake and Dum-
fries in the mile Essendon Handicap;
and Leonatus (W. A. Smith) and
Laimell (V. Hartney) taking divisions
of the Fawkner Handicap (6f.).

It is to be hoped that the L.T.A.
selectors responsible for excluding
Bromwich and Sedgman from the
last Davis Cup team took careful
note of play in the N.S.W. Cham-
pionships held at White City (Sydney)
over the past week or so; likewise
the gentleman who described Brom-
wich as “washed-up” around the time
Bromwich went to Wimbledon,
entered all three finals and won two
of them. All members of the Davis
Cup team played in the N.S.W. titles;
Bromwich eliminated Sidwell, who
had beaten Long, and Sedgman
accounted for both Brown and Quist.
In the final of the singles Bromwich,
playing magnificent tennis, beat the
youngster 6-4, 6-1, 7-5.
Bromwich seems to have regained
his keenness for the game, and with
it his outstanding ability. If he holds
such form, he and Sedgman plus
Brown (also playing very well) and
possibly Sidwell would make a team
worth sending over for the Cup.
The American girl Doris Hart made
an excellent impression; her antici-
pated chief rival, Mrs, Bolton, how-
ever, played inexplicably poor tennis
throughout the tournament, and was
beaten in straight sets in the semi-
final by Miss J. Fitch. Playing under
unaccustomed conditions and feeling
her way against strange opponents,
Miss Hart had her back to the wall
more than once but reached and won
all three finals; she beat Joyce Fitch
1-6, 6-4, 6-2 in the singles, won the
women’s doubles with Mrs. Bolton
and 'die mixed doubles with Sedgman.
Most of the big crowd that fol-
lowed the Ampol £lOOO golfers at
Tire Lakes (Sydney) on Saturday were
centred around a bright red shirt.
It was worn by Von Nida. Pick-
worth, the ultimate winner, had only
about a dozen watching him and
Cremin on the 71st green. Pick-
worth, with 293 for the 72 holes, was
five strokes under Nagle (298), third
was Want with 300, a stroke below
Von Nida and McWilliam, who tied
for fourth.

En route for the customary Sheffield
Shield opening match v. Queensland,
the N.S.W. XI wrought a little havoc
among the locals at Lismore (N.S.W.),
winning by an innings and 157. At
Brisbane the ’Walers began well; with
Morris (120), Moss (52), Miller (109)
and Moroney (122) they had three
down for 301, but didn’t quite sustain
that rate, being all out for 499.
Moroney’s 122 took 265 minutes,
which purists would term a solid
defensive innings and most spectators
call a solid pain in the neck.
Queensland’s new trundler Swend-
sen was given a long tryout and took
one for 64 off 16 overs, but the best
bowling figures were obtained by
Carrigan (3 for 54). McCool (1 for
137) and Johnson (2 for 106) were
treated with some asperity. ’Keeper
Don Tallon showed good form, allow-
ing only one bye. When a light-
appeal was successful at 4.56 p.m. on
Saturday, Queensland had 71 on the
board for two wickets.

The New Zealand rowers at present
visiting these parts made their first
appearance at the Haberfield regatta
held on the Iron Cove (Sydney) course
on Saturday; unfortunately a strong
wind and very choppy water made
good rowing impossible. The Kiwis
are a fine, powerful-looking bunch,
averaging over 12.7 in weight, despite
which they are very fast and capable
of high rating. However, they struck
tough opposition in the King’s Cup-
winning Haberfield crew stroked by
J. Eddie; Haberfield won by three
parts of a length and looked as
if they could do so again. The
Kiwi sculler J. Schneider had a lucky
win over the Haberfield man Kevin
Webb, who crabbed, or rather was
swamped, just short of the finish.
Both are fine scullers but unlikely to
beat Merv Woods.

N.S.W. flyweight champion Jimmy
Hogg (7.13) had little more than a
gym. workout when he fought Novo-
castrian Les Feighan (7. Hi) at Leich-
hardt. Attacking willingly, Hogg
won the first three rounds hfinds
down. Feighan landed a solid left
hook to the head in the fourth which
had the effect of stinging Hogg into
real action, and shortly afterwards the
ref. stopped the massacre.

Fruslrative “Prosperity”
Mr. H. D. Giddy, chairman
of the National Bank of Aus-
tralasia, told the bank’s share-
holders last week that, from an
economic point of view, he be-
lieved that the period of transi-
tion from war-time conditions
to those of peace has ended.
“The end of the transition
period finds Australia with an
extremely high level of indus-
trial and trade activity,” said Mr.
Giddy ; “almost a ‘boom’ if one
viewed it in terms of the pre-
war cycle experience common
to the more highly industrialised
nations. We are far beyond the
position where everyone desirous
of working is employed, for at
present an appreciable number
of people are even able to
occupy, concurrently, more than
one job. Semi-official state-
ments from Government quar-
ters earlier in the year placed
the number of jobs available
with no one to fill them at prac-
tically 100,000.”
The National Bank chairman
continued:
Along with this acute shortage of
labor, Australia is enjoying a period
of extremely high export prices for
her main primary products, which
still comprise the great bulk of ex-
ports. This combination of con-
ditions, severely accentuated by the
reduction of the standard working
week from 44 hours to 40 hours on
January 1 this year, has brought con-
siderable pressure to bear upon our
domestic costs and prices, which, as
everyone knows only too well, have
recently tended to advance at an un-
comfortably fast rate. Another strong
influence pressing in the same direc-
tion is a large flow of imports coming
in at very high prices, comprising
both finished goods ready for the
market and essential raw materials
for Australian industry. And on top
of all there is now deeply implanted
in our post-war economy an extremely
high level of Government spending,
necessitating, for peace-time, an im-
mensely greater load of income taxes
and indirect, taxation than in pre-war
years. Though one would not like
to contemplate the indefinite continu-
ance of the present scale of taxation,
I feel that all must expect a per-
manently higher burden than in the
past.
Mr, Giddy ventures to fore-
cast that supply of many things
will soon catch up with demand:
Though war-time shortages of a
substantial variety of goods and ser-
vices have been largely made up,
unfortunately a great many of the
shortages remaining are concerned
with the essential needs of the com-
munity, such as houses, fuel and
power supplies. In these spheres the
pressure of unsatisfied demand is still
great, but over the whole range of
goods and services regularly purchased
by the community it is probably true
to say that the preponderating in-
fluence on higher prices is that of
higher costs rather than public buy-
ing pressure.
The domestic market is showing
signs of swinging slowly but surely
from conditions of a “sellers’ market”
to conditions nearer to those of a
“buyers’ market” By this I do
not wish to aver that we are heading
for a slump. I am emphasising that
in things economic constant change
is the order, and that business expec-
tations and forecasting will be sadly
astray if they do not take full account
of this fact.
If, as is probably the case, some
of the problems which gave rise to
much bitterness and dissension in
pre-war years have been largely
solved, there are a host of new ones
with us, which, in their turn, are
today giving rise to just as much con-
cern and acrimony, One of the most
immediate problems is the low volume
of production accompanying the em-
ployment of virtually all men and
women wishing to work. In all the
main products the volume of rural
production is below, or shows in-
significant improvement upon, that
of pre-war years. Taking into
account the substantial increase in
the number of persons, employed,
the level of output from secondary
industry leaves no doubt that oyer
this section as a whole production
per man-hour of work is lower than
ten years ago.
Within this general problem is a
serious distortion of productive effort
which affects most severely many of
the industries producing basic
materials and products so badly
wanted by the community, such as
coal, the heavy metal industries, con-
struction and the primary industries.
Drained of labor by lighter industry,
by present-day opportunities for those
who prefer to be free from routine
occupation, and by mounting Gov-
ernment employment, output from
many basic industries remains deplor-
ably low, constituting a stubborn drag
on our attempts to achieve economic
progress.
Strenuous attempts have been made
during the last two or three years
by some of our clearer-thinking
leaders to find ways and means of
increasing the nation’s productive
effort, but frustration remains the
order of the day. Hopes of success
were dealt a severe blow by the
premature reduction of the standard
working week to forty hours. Pro-
ductive effort still suffers from the
weakening of the old automatic
sanctions on the failure to give con-
stant work, while for many workers,
enterprises and producers the taxation
burden continues to seriously damage
incentive. Nothing like a full effort
is being made, and we must frankly
admit that we have not yet learnt
“It'd he a shame to take the money."
the secret of full production in a
world of full employment and wide-
spread social security.
Canberra should take par-
ticular notice of that last sen-
tence. ,
The Sharemarket
Lack of strength in the Aus-
tralian sharemarkets last week
resulted in a number of stocks
fading slightly in quotations, but
the downward movement was
certainly not very pronounced.
However, it was a movement
from the stable conditions pre-
vailing for a considerable period.
Not nearly so much hunger is
shown by the market these days
for new issues. The raising of
capital by public companies has
reached record proportions, and,
under some propulsion from
the new private-company tax
law, many private concerns are
now inviting public subscription
of their shares. In most cases
of sound enterprises in this posi-
tion a substantial premium, de-
termined by the Treasury, is
asked for on the scrip, which
tends to rob the investment
market of enthusiasm.
Many of these newly-listed
ventures have yet to prove them-
selves as Stock Exchange in-
vestments. A number are un-
doubtedly speculative, and some
have got off to a bad start by
the manner of their flotation.
But so far as the proven Stock
Exchange equities are concerned,
there are few that should be
hastily discarded merely because
of any present weakening in the
sharemarket. The money which
would be received in return for
the stocks is not gaining in buy-
ing-power, and though business
is reported to be “quiet” in
some quarters, there is no real
evidence yet of credit-contrac-
tion.
Average cost of first-mort-
gage money continues to fall.
In New South Wales it is now
around 4.4 p.c. in respect of
urban properties, compared with
4.5 p.c. in 1947, 4.7 p.c. in 1946
and 5.5 p.c. in 1939. Since De-
cember, 1945, the maximum rate
of interest paid on fixed deposits
(two-year) has been 1.5 p.c.,
against 2 p.c. on savings-bank
deposits up to a limited amount.
Total fixed deposits lodged with
the trading banks, after a decline
from £233 million in Sept., 1946,
to £223 million in Sept., 1947,
have shown little change over
the past year in spite of a general
increase in banking funds.
People prefer to keep their money
freely liquid rather than tie them
up for even a short term at the
low interest rates offering. A
much greater proportion of
public savings is now going into
the trading banks than to the
savings banks.

Senator Courtice, Minister
for Trade and Customs, explain-
ing why refined-sugar supplies
are erratic and scarce:
The worst sugar shortages are ex-
perienced in Victoria and South Aus-
tralia; less serious shortages in New
South Wales. The following tabula-
tion which has been supplied to me
shows clearly the principal causes of
lowered production in those States
for the first nine months of 1948:

I would like to emphasise once
again that the shortage of refined
sugar in Australia cannot be laid at
the door of the raw-sugar producing
industry. _ .
It is confidently expected that raw-
sugar production this year will be no
less than 900,000 tons and our
domestic consumption may approach
500,000 tons. The balance, after
allowing for reserve stocks to be
maintained in Australia, will be ex-
ported, principally to the United
Kingdom.
Senator Courtice added that the
refining industry, working at
capacity, could handle 550,000
tons of sugar a year—ample for
Australian requirements. In the
table the second iterq: “Raw
sugar —shortages and deteriora-
tion in quality,” accounting for
a large proportion of our sugar
shortages, is the result of the
hold-ups on North Queensland
wharves, where the stacked
sugar deteriorates under tropical
conditions.


THE COLONIAL SUGAR
REFINING CO. LTD.
Notes from General Manager’s Report to Shareholders —
November, 1948.
AUSTRALIAN RAW SUGAR PRODUCTION is expected to
yield 910,000 tons —up to 500,000 tons for home consumption
via refineries, and the balance for overseas under contract with
British Ministry of Food. The Company’s seven mills in Australia
are expected to produce 189,000 tons of the total of 910,000
tons.
About 270,000 tons of raw sugar are already stored in
Queensland awaiting shipment. For many mills there is still grave
uncertainty whether they will be able to ship their sugar fast
enough to prevent serious crop loss.
IN FIJI the season has been favourable, and raw sugar
production is expected to be 136,000 tons —all C.S.R. Co. mills.
SHORTAGES OF REFINED SUGAR IN AUSTRALIA.
Housewives and manufacturers have not received their full require-
ments of refined sugar, although sales are now 37 p.c,, or 124,000
tons per annum, higher "than immediately before the war. With
full efficient manning, sufficient coal of reasonable quality and
continuity of supplies of undeteriorated raw sugar, our refineries
could, if necessary, out-turn an additional 100,000 tons per annum.
The most serious refined sugar shortage is being felt in Vic-
toria. Despite every effort, our refinery there is so short of man-
power that we are now processing 700 tons a week below the
factory’s capacity. We have been expecting the assistance of
immigrant labour for a considerable time.
IN NEW ZEALAND the rationing of sugar for household use
ceased on 30th August last, but to manufacturers it has not yet
been lifted.
DISTILLERIES. The supply of raw materials has improved,
and it has been possible to discontinue the previous light rationing
of methylated spirits. Our rum again obtained the Champion
Prize at the Sydney Royal Easter Show.
BUILDING MATERIALS. Production is well below capacity,
due to difficulties in obtaining raw materials, supplies and labour.
The new Hardboard plant has commenced production, and the
board has been most favourably received.
INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS. The new subsidiary company has
been registered. The products will be cellulose acetate moulding
powder for the plastic trade, acetic anhydride for the aspirin
industry, and fine chemicals such as Vitamins B 1 and C.

LONDON AIRMAIL
From Herbert Holman
Parliament in Session
Apart from the final passing
of the Parliament Bill (intended
to weaken the powers of the
Upper Chamber without
attempting to reform it), and the
nationalisation of the steel in-
dustry, no other announced
legislation is likely to provoke
party strife. A round score of
other items includes the re-
organisation of civil defence;
the equipment and efficiency of
the armed forces ; national parks
for England and Wales; wider
access to the countryside for
ramblers; better training for
nurses; protection of the coast
from erosion; development of
the white-fish industry; safer
milk; improved magistrates’
courts and payment of jurors ;
legal aid for persons of moder-
ate means ; measures to ease the
housing situation and to extend
rent-control to shared rooms and
houses and flats let for the first
time since the war;
Much argument over some of
these latter measures is certain,
but it will be confined to details
and not to principles. Indeed,
such is the business of govern-
ment. The legislation proposed
seeks only to bring the Statute
Book up -to - date with the
nation’s condition and to meet
its changing needs. But the same
cannot be said of the Labor
Government’s unremitting ad-
herence to its mania for nation-
alisation.
In 1945 the Socialists were re-
turned with an absolute majority
because (a) a large number of
servicemen, believing that they
would get “outside” quicker, told
their wives and parents to vote
Labor, and ( b ) the “middle-of-
the-road” voters felt that it was
time for a change. Weary after
the strain of the war years, they
handed over the country as a
going concern to new manage-
ment which, they thought, would
have young blood, energy and
no class distinctions. The new
Cabinet, because of its deference
to the claims of old stalwarts,
actually turned out to have an
average age that was near senile ;
its energy has seemed most
vigorous when applied to mak-
ing the way safe for Socialism
and the old faithfuls of the
Labor “movement” have proved
to be as class-conscious as
Brahmins.
Strife
The electorate did not give the
Socialists the responsibilities of
office in order that they might
either enjoy the reward of a
long struggle or carry out a
doctrinaire programme: the
business of the Government was
to manage the affairs of the
nation, not willy-nilly to use it
as a vehicle for a grand experi-
ment in Socialism. At least, that
was what a large and decisive
body of voters thought. The
extent of its error can only be
left to the slow pain of repent-
ance.
The bitter party strife over
the bill for nationalisation of
steel is likely to last until the
next general election, perhaps
even beyond. It can do nothing
but confuse and befuddle the
ordinary citizen. On this count
alone the Labor Government
must take heavy blame. By its
appeals for national unity punc-
tuated with sly ruses for feather-
ing its own political nest, by say-
ing one thing and doing another,
and by its cynicism and partisan
sincerity it has turned countless
decent men and women away
from politics, which they look
upon as “just another racket.”
Britons have plenty of
problems of their own. Among
responsible citizens not the least
is private concern at the state of
the nation’s economic and poli-
tical health. There is an innate
desire to know something, and to
do something, about it. Experi-
ences that can still be called re-
cent have proved unity of pur-
pose to be the best counter to
threat and adversity. In the
hearts of good citizens this urge
to pull together is an emotion
that cannot find expression. As
with all strong emotions, its sup-
pression must inevitably lead to
frustration: in this instance, to
political apathy.
No one knows better than the
ordinary man and woman how
nationalisation has raised prices
and lowered quality; and how
bureaucracy has tried to do too
much top quickly. The rami-
fications of the steel industry are
bewildering l to any but the ex-
pert. But it is well known that
private enterprise has worked
well and efficiently side by side
with Government direction.
What, therefore, is the object of
nationalisation? The industry
has been conspicuously suc-
cessful both in results and in in-
ternal relationships. Careful
analysis would seem to prove
that there is one answer only:
the extreme Left, by holding a
pistol at the Cabinet and threat-
ening a split within the ranks,
wantonly seeks to squander its
inheritance in a doctrinaire
orgy. The danger is that the
ordinary citizen, in his con-
fusion, may be driven to lose all
interest,
Oxford and Drama
It is heartening to learn that a
readership in drama may be in-
stituted at Oxford University.
Dramatic art has long been
neglected in the higher reaches
of learning. Although much
erudition has been devoted to
the study of plays and play-
wrights, the results, while not
without value, have contributed
proportionately little to the prac-
tical art of drama; that is, to
the acting of a play in a living
theatre before an audience.
A commission, generously sub-
sidised by Sir Alexander Korda,
has recently returned to this
country after studying the work-
ing of departments of drama in
American universities. The pub-
lished proposals are sound, prac-
tical and free from pedantry.
Realising that drama cannot be
treated as an exact science and
that it must be appreciated
rather than learned, the com-
mission fears that a department
of drama is a great deal more
than is needed.
It recommends the building of
a laboratory theatre structurally
capable of staging Classical,
Elizabethan, Restoration or
modern drama. The university,
in association with the Arts
Council and the British Drama
League, would arrange for reper-
tory companies to perform. The
reader in drama would have the
responsibility of ensuring that
the presentation of plays was
academically true. But the
essence of drama —to be seen
and heard and felt, not merely
read—would be preserved.
The committee also investi-
gated the academic side of film
production. Because of the scant
opportunity for making films of
appeal to tastes more discerning
than the general, the recom-
mendations are limited to the ex-
hibition of borrowed films, to
lectures and to the offer of prizes
as encouragement to outstanding
potential talent.
Free for All
Why, according to my dentist,
he is so overstressed with work:
There is, he says, a nice distinc-
tion between the doctor’s and
the dentist’s surgery. Medical
treatment generally does not
hurt; dental treatment often
does. Therefore, while doctors
are besieged with trivial com-
plaints, dentists are' fully occu-
pied, not with the drill, but in
trying to cope with that branch
of their practice which is at once
painless and costly—the fitting
and supply of new dental plates.
And the demand is. overwhelm-
ing.
Opticians tell a similar story.
So do hospital staffs, who report
a surge of applications for all
kinds of appliances, ranging
from elastic kneecaps to invalid
chairs. There is no evidence that
intending patients have heeded
the Minister of Health’s plea to
be reasonable.
Something for nothing? Or
is.it? ... c


ABORIGINALITIES
“Mat’s Mate”; We got into a pub in
Ballarat one time, fairly late at night,
had a few tonics and ambled off to bed.
Before we turned in Mat went out and
along the passage and came back with a
very thoughtful expression. “What’s
bitin’ you?” I asked. “Nothin’,” says
he. I picked up my toothbrush and said,
“Where’s the bathroom?” “Along the
passage,” he says. “Y’ll see two doors
at the end. It’s the one on the right.”
I went along. There was no light, but
I could see the door and opened it. It
was a bedroom and in it was a young
woman in a dressing-gown brushing her
hair. I let out an apology and backed
out. “What’s going on?” she said. I
ducked. Back in our room I said,“Hey,
it wasn’t the door on the right.” “No,”
Mat said. “What’s your point?” says I.
“Well,” says he, “I barged in there, too.
She’s in a petticoat and stockings an’ she
says, ‘Oh, I didn’t know they had such
things in Ballarat.’ So I reckoned if
you went in you might find out what she
was drivin’ at.” I thought it over.
“Well, I’m blowed if I know,” I said.
He started throwing his gear together.
“What’s up?” I says. “It’s better down
at Bacchus Marsh,” he says. “Up here
a man might be run into a church an’
married before he can wake up. I ain’t
sayin’ there’s traps about, but y’ gotta
watch it.” It cost us 465. for a car to
the Marsh.
* * * ♦
“Scotty”: Skippering for a small
islands outfit, I selected my boss boy
from those paraded for my choice by
the Chinese bosun. The first assignment
I entrusted to my new shipboard factotum
was the choosing of six deckboys, and
warned him that the consequences of
fear, favor or affection in such selection
would be terribly visited on his own head.
•Perhaps it .was through confusion arising
to my reference to “head” or perhaps
through a desire to flatter the new boss,
but an hour later I was confronted by
a smiling and sable sextet, each of whom
sported a thatch of a fiery redness
identical with my own. To my demand
“What name this fella?” the dusky chief
steward replied naively: “Grass ’e stop
long top dem fella all same brudder
b’long you fella!”
* * *. *
“Gravelsnatcher”: Without, I hope,
doing a spot of thunder-thieving, “Pongo”
is merely reiterating my remark when he
claims (B. 3/11/’4B) that jarrah is not
the hardest of our hardwoods. And he
speaks with more profundity than
originality when he avers that there’s an
art in nail-driving. Of course there is,
and Westralian wood-butchers may claim
some familiarity with the art. Yet,
wherever possible, they fight shy of dry
jarrah—did “Pongo” overlook that little
word? Pulling down and re-erecting old
jarrah structures is a headache to any-
one. It’s often as hard to extract a nail
as it is to drive one—some oxidising pro-
cess, continued over a score of years,
welds wood and metal into an almost in-
separable entity, “Pongo” offers to drive a
6in. nail through a 2in. jarrah plank with
one swipe. Weill Over here we nail dry
jarrah to steel girders with spikes that
size, only we don’t do it with one swipe
until we get into the metal, where the
going’s softer. I’ll cover “Pongo’s” bet
if he’ll make it a Sin. nail and let me
select the jarrah—bone-dry and seasoned
for up to 30 years. One stipulation: I
won’t give him an unlimited supply of
nails. A hundredweight is all he’ll get.
That’s a lot of nails to waste puncturihg
an idle boast.
* * * ♦
“Horseless Horseman”: From a bush-
carpenter and axeman’s viewpoint planks
from a centuries-old Murray River red-
gum are infinitely harder than those sawn
from a 50-year-old tree grown quickly
on a low river bend. The same thing
can be said of the stands
of Huon pine which were cut in Tassie
last century as against the comparatively
sappy young stuff fallen today. Maybe
it’s something to do with the knitting of
the grain, since there’s a vast difference
between the quick-growing forest
mountain ash that the old paling-splitter
used to pick and the same tree grown on
an open plain. The hardest Australian
woods are those grown inside the lOin,
rain-belt, such as mulga, myall, etc. The
N.S.W. needlewood is about the hardest
timber of all.

“Eastern”: On his weekly trip into the
township with his cream, old Bill reached
the one steep pinch on the road, where
the ancient utility failed. He climbed
down stiffly, looked inside the bonnet,
scratched his head, made all the usual
wondering comments connected with
such occasions and admired the grass in
the near-by paddocks. After half an hour
of fussing, cussing and rolling smokes
the utility kicked over once more and the
trip was resumed. The following week
“Sorry, sir. A bottle of our hair-restorer will fix that .”
she again played up on the steep pinch,
and Bill was delayed another half-hour
or so. A bit fed up with the utility’s
tantrums, the old chap took precautions
against a repeat performance. Before
rounding the corner on to the steep
stretch on the next trip Bill pulled up,
and, taking a large piece of hessian,
chucked it over the front, blindfolding
the old utility completely. They went up
without further trouble.

“ifbet”: Weary had a job looking
after that west section, and was told
that when time allowed he could put
down some holes for the new fence.
Passing that way a couple of weeks later,
Bob eyed the proposed fence-line, de-
cided Weary must be having trouble
with the stock, and went off. to investi-
gate. He spotted the section-bloke
dragging across the flat on a sleepy nag.
Soon the nag reached the boundary,
turned, and was travelling slowly along
the fence when Bob hailed. Weary came
upright with a jerk. “Gripes,” he gasped,
taking in the other hand, “I thought for
a minute you was the boss. He’s cornin’
over t’day. Seen anything of ’im?”
“No. What’re you doing down here?”
“Me? Coin’ round the sheep, o’ course,”
Weary explained. “Bloke’s got t’ keep a
eye on ’em, y* know.” “Yair, but,” Bob
glanced round the landscape, “there ain’t
a sheep nearer than 'the long gully, half
a mile back.” Weary checked the state-
ment within eye-range. “That’s right,”
he agreed. “Must look ’em over d’rectly.
Just at present I —er" He glanced
round perplexedly. “Yair, that’s it—l
must be lookin’ for holes in this flamin’
fence.”

“Richard Small”: The pair of sun-
birds had built their nest on a twig of a
guava bush near the road and hanging
no more than a couple of feet from the
ground. Just as they got settled in it
began to rain, and I noticed that, although
the entrance of the nest had a small
verandah above, the rain was blowing in.
Next day I was passing that* way again,
and, as it was still raining, I decided to
put something to shelter the nest. I was
saved the trouble. The original entrance
had been blocked and a new one, com-
plete with verandah, had been made on
the opposite side. The nest had not
twisted, for the verandah above the
covered entrance was still intact.

“Lower Tops’!”: Those Tassie con-
victs who seized the brig Frederick in
1834 and sailed to South America (B.
8/ 9/ ’4B) later proved in a British court
they were not pirates. When the. penal
settlement at Macquarie Harbor was
abandoned 10 prisoners and a guard of
four soldiers were left behind to finish
building the 120-ton brig. Finally ad-
verse winds detained the vessel, and the
prisoners, who were allowed unusual
liberty, captured the ship and, placing
the pilot, master shipwright and soldiers
ashore, they put to sea. Six weeks later
they sighted their destination, Valdivia, in
Chile. However, as the vessel had been
badly strained on the arduous voyage, the
party scuttled the brig and landed from
the launch. At Valdivia they disclosed the
entire facts of their escape, and, being
promised protection by the Governor, they
married. Later, when H.M.S. Blonde
arrived, her commander tried to arrest
the mutineers, but he was repelled by
force. Unfortunately, a new Governor
afterwards gave the men up (except three
who escaped), and these were repatriated
to Hobart, where they were tried for
piracy in 1837. One of them raised the
ingenious point that as “the vessel was
of canvas, rope, boardings and trenails
put together shipwise,” she was not
legally a ship, since she had no port of
registry and had never been finished.
The seizure, therefore, amounted not to
piracy but theft. This point, on appeal
to English Judges, was upheld and the
men were found not guilty, but, being
escaped lifers, they ended their days at
Port Arthur.
* * ♦ ♦
“Nto”: Having watched domestic and
wild birds handle large centipedes very
casually, even to swallowing them with-
out prior pulping or pecking and without
showing any discomfort then or later, I
can only conclude that this is another
case of nature putting up a bluff —con-
fined to its repulsive and fearsome aspect
—to protect one of its helpless creatures.
* ♦ , ♦ *
“Kelms”: I’ve heard of that wheat
which, “found in the Great Pyramid,
4000 years old, was planted and grew” (B.
10/11/’4B), but can someone tell me
how long it took to germinate? My ex-
perience with garden seeds has shown
that they take about a day longer for each
additional year of age. Thus, if last year’s
saving germinates in four days, the pre-
vious year’s will take five, and so on. On
that basis a 4000-year-old seed would
remain in good germinating conditions for
about 11 years before sprouting. It prob-
ably didn’t require anywhere near that
time, but it’s surprising how long a seed
can remain in the ground without rotting.
German bombs, ploughing deep into
London’s soil, produced a crop of un-
known flowers. Research revealed that
they were varieties which had not been
seen since the Great Fire.
* * * ♦
“Orto”: An example of the economic
value of birds to agriculture is to be
seen along the N.S.W. south coast. In
that area for some years past the intro-
duced African black-beetle, a species of
scarab, has been playing havoc with corn
crops and paspalum pastures. It is
noticeable that com crops with bush on
three or four sides suffer little damage
from the beetle, whereas in more open
areas damage is greater, and on extensive
open treeless flats it is almost hopeless
trying to grow this crop. In such open
areas absence of normal cover from
natural enemies, such as hawks, dis-
courages most species of our native birds
from venturing into them, despite the
abundance of food available. The beetle
being most active at dusk and during the
night it has, at the seasons of its greatest
activity, become the main food of such
birds as frogmouths, nightjars and certain
species of owls, casts from these birds
at times showing 100 p.c. beetle skeletons.
All of these nocturnal feeding species
need trees or shrubs as cover for safe
daylight perching. The black-beetle
never reaches plague or pest numbers
in its native home, though its distribution
ranges from Abyssinia to Cape Colony.
Whether its natural control is a wasp or
bird is not known, though certain para-
sitic wasps are known to attack its
larvas.

“Nemo”: Rodent cannibalism (B.
10/11/’48)? A bundle of old-type rat-
traps having the funnel-shaped entrance
was hooked to the station storeroom for
some years. A rat plague brought them
to earth and revealed the grisly contents
of one trap which had evidently been
hanging near a rafter. Confronting us
was the father of all rats. It glared with
fierce eyes, its grey bulk standing over the
gnawed remains of other rats. We
counted the tails of his 13 victims.

“Spinifex”: Old Woolbales, of Briga-
low, was suing Bill the Bullocky for the
return of the strawberry leader he’d
loaned him some months before. A
Brigalow stationhand had served a
“notice of demand” upon the adamant
ox-conductor, and Woolbales’s solicitor
was striving earnestly to extract from the
young cove some information to that
effect. “Now, sir,” he said suavely.
“When you left Brigalow, on the morn-
ing of the twelfth of last month and
proceeded to Wpolarooka, you took
something with you, did you not?” The
witness thought hard for a while.
“Yairs,” he at last admitted, reluctantly.
“Well!” said Costs engagingly. “Will
you please tell the Court what it was you
took with you on that occasion?” The
young stationhand looked appealingly at
the Bench. “Have I gotta answer that?”
he asked. On being assured that he must,
he drew a deep breath. “Orright!” he
said defiantly. “I took a clean shirt!”

“M.U.R.”: What does The Bulletin
“answers-man” mean by “the common
myna” (B. 24/11 /’4B) which he listed
among imported birds that have thrived
in this country? In addition to the well-
known, and frequently well-cursed,
soldier bird of the Murray country there
are other species. If the soldier bird is
the “common myna” I rise to assert that
not only is it an uncommon sort of bird,
except in numbers, but that I never before
heard of it except as a minah, and that
goes for the crested bell-minah, the dusky,
the green and the rest of them. Oh, yes,
I know most Australians spell it miner,
but that came out of the bush and is
based on the phonetics of the speaker, not
the bird.

“Old-timer”: Old Jim Hansen has had
motor-cars. “The trouble with ’em,”
says he, “is that they’re never satisfied.
Always gotta be changin’ ’em. I used
t’ drive a buggy an’ pair. In me first car
I used t’ change the gears by puttin’ me
foot on the pedal, speedin’ up an’ then
lettin’ the pedal back. Well, it took me
a long time t’ get used t’ it. Useter pull
on the wheel an’ yell ‘Whoa!’ and won-
der what happened when I busted open
somebody’s gate. Then they brought
in this here gear-lever business. Same
trouble. Couldn’t get used t’ it after
the pedal change, an’ started yellin’
‘Whoa!’ again an’ pushin’ an’ pullin’
with me foot on the pedals. Cripes, half
the back country was gummed up with
the smashed gates. Blokes’d see a
smashed gate and reckon ol’ Jim Hansen
musta bin through there. Right up inter
Queensland an’ out past Euglo West every
busted gate was blamed on t’ me. Bought
a newie last year. Never thought t’ look
at her. Gear-change was a lever on the
wheel this time. Me, I*d rim up t a
gate, start t’ yell ‘Whoa!,’ feel with me
foot, wake up an’ grab for the gear-lever.
No ruddy gear-lever, an’ be the time
I’d find the gadget under the wheel I’d
be through that gate an’ bustin’ up the
nex’ one. Strike me, they ain’t a sound
gate between here an’ Bill Clarkson’s pub
in North Murchison. Wouldn’t it rock
y’?” Jim paused and contemplated his
beer. “What’ll y’ do,” asked Perkins,
“when they bring in these here jet-pro-
pulsion things?” Jim absorbed his beer.
“Reckon I’ll buy a buggy an’ pair,” he
said.
WHITE ROOFS.
Across our wide, deep continent,
By hollow, rise and plain,
Where man first pitched his settler’s tent
To make his home again:
Gleaming on far blue mountain-tops,
Shining on flats below,
Hugging the roads and distant stops
Where horns and whistles blow:
White roofs beneath the wide, blue sky,
Stretching for ever to the eye.
By fences long and ways that wind,
By farm and station run.
White-hot they glimmer and they blind
Beneath the summer sun:
Hot squares of light like beacons far
Against the grey and brown • y
And blue of bush and purple bar
That lie behind the town;
And when the days are cloudy, they
Reflect the sky’s dull leaden grey.
White roofs that hold the light of sun,
The silver of the moon,
And look like pools where deserts run,
A dim and far lagoon;
That mark the land where humans stray,
Linked in a shining band:
White roofs that glare for ever, aye,
The milestones of our land,
In clustered groups, or lone and bare
At vast blue skies they stand and stare.
White roofs of farm and mill and mine,
Of dusty towns outback,
Of shearing-shed and homestead fine.
Cottage and barn and shack;
Of country store and boundary hut,
Of home and industry:
They stretch wherever our lands jut
From inland heart to sea:
White roofs that mark our settlement:
Our patches on a continent.
VICTORIA.

“Wippegong”: The dusky wood-swal-
lows have chicks in our valley. Some of
them spent all the winter here, and in
spring were reinforced by others from
even milder regions further north. They
built in stumps, broken branches and
hollow posts, and interrupted domestic
duty only now and then to snap at some
local fowl which couldn’t see that it
should no longer enter that particular
territory. Then a few weeks ago the
white-browed wood-swallows arrived,
flocks of them. They came over high,
their plaintive “cleet, elect” sounding
somewhere towards the clouds ; but as
soon as they descended to tree-level the
duskies were at them. Couples whose
former deportment was exemplary now
flung decorum to the winds and tore into
the latest migrants. The tone of the
abuse indicated its contents. “They’ll
take the tucker out of our mouths! ” they
shrieked. “How will we get on for
homes now! ” And one especially hysteri-
cal squeal sounded something like
“Reffo! ” But the white-brows have lived
through it, have found more stumps,
broken branches and hollow posts and
sufficient grass-roots to line them ; the
duskies’ youngsters are still plump, and,
generally, our valley has prospects of the
most pest-free season for years.

“Blime”: “Man Attacked by Shearer,”
Big Dalby spotted the headline and
scrambled to a sitting position. “Well,
I’ve heard of a bloke bein’ killed be a
wild boar,” he announced, “or gored be
a bull, but this here’s the limit,” The
paper promptly went the rounds, the
shearing team gathering into a bunch in
a chorus of protest. It was after knock-
off that evening I came on Dill laboring
importantly with pen and paper. “I bin
elected to write about that in the paper,”
he informed me weightily. I asked him
what for. “Well —er —the way they put
it,” he glared. “We don’t like it, see?
Shearers always stick t’gether, an’ Dalby
says it’ll give people the wrong idea.
Reckons I got t’ tell the bloke t’ alter it
in the next paper or the gang’ll come down
an’ shear the hide off him. A shearer
don’t play no lone hand, he says, an’ I
can sort o’ suggest the bunch’s pretty
mad.” “H’m,” I mused. . What’re you
going to ask him to alter it to. Dill?”
“Get Ram Singh to bring his orchestra."
The letter-writer paused thoughtfully.
“Well, now,” he decided, “I’ll make the
cow c’rect it to ‘Man Attacked be a Mob
o’ Mad Shearers.’ ”

“Antro”: Collecting native folk-lore
tales of the south-west Pacific gives the
investigator some puzzling problems re-
garding the complexities of native
thought. One discovers the simplest of
tales, so short one doesn’t realise they
are finished. Such a one is as follows:
“Once there was a woman called Tio,
She went down to the sea and dipped her
head in a big rock-pool and her hair
dried up all the water.” It seems to
satisfy the hearers and convey a definite
meaning. On the other hand a tale may
be long and involved, cleverly conveying
a moral or some deeply-significant tribal
meaning, extremely involved genealogy
and totemism, so that the recorder is con-
stantly left wondering at the ingenuity of
its originator. Both types of story and
the intermediates between the extremes
seem to be fully understood by the
listeners and give equal satisfaction to
adult and juvenile audiences.

“Telarb”: Kuuam of Mabuiag—one of
the Augads of Torres Strait —is popu-
larly represented as a man of normal
stature yet whose “widun”—wide-opened
mouth —was capable of engulfing men by
the dozen. Actually there is a creek on
Mabuiag today called Widunsaraka which
commemorates one of Kuuam’s gastro-
nomical feats. His grave, covered by a
cairn of stones surmounted by the sym-
bolic three boo shells, stands today on
top of Mabuiag’s highest point. Merely
to touch this grave means “you go all
lumpy,” and a horrible death awaits him
who dares to open it. This is the popular
old wives’ tale, but the more intelligent
islanders incline to the view that a remote
ancestor with a sense of humor erected
the cairn as a joke and carefully nurtured
the legend. Yet any suggestion that they
open it to destroy the legend is met with
a firm refusal.

“Bo”: “These logs you blokes’ve bin
naggin’ about,” declared Big Steve scorn-
fully, “are nothin’ but toothpicks that’ve
run to fat. Ever see any o’ the big red
cedars in the country back o’ Stroud?
Joe Moriarty an’ me brought one down
a few years ago. I won’t say anything
about bringin’ it down except to mention
that some o’ them scientist jokers down
in Sydney reported one day that their in-
struments they use for measurin’ how far
away earthquakes happen jumped like
mad, though no news of any ’quake ever
came out —that was the day we felled
the cedar. We didn’t start sawin’ the butt
log for a day or two later until Joe rigged
up his carrier-pigeon loft near by. “Why
did you want pigeons for?’’"asked Wonga
Williams. Big Steve looked at him as a
teacher might regard a particularly dull
pupil. “Well, not being able to hear each
other, bein’ so far away, how the hell did
you think we’d get messages to each other
across the log as we worked?”

“Zake”; Except those few who have
become prominent of recent years
through their association with the arts,
Mulga Fred was Australia’s best-known
aborigine. He died at Horsham (Vic.)
beneath the wheels of the Adelaide
express after apparently having fallen
from the railway platform. A Westralian
full-blood, he went to the Cabbage
Garden in his early twenties as a member
of a buckjump show. A magnificent
horseman, and a marvel with boomerang
and whip, he delighted show and football
crowds in Melbourne and the Victorian
country towns for half a century. He
was 74 at the finish.

“B. A. Ker”: Few riflemen would
oppose “Kelms” for contending that there
is nothing incongruous in the idea of
a marksman needing spectacles (B.
20/10/’4B). If natural vision were essen-
tial rifle-shooting would be a pastime re-
stricted almost entirely to young men.
It is not; few sports embrace adherents
of such diverse ages; and what the old
boys lack in keenness of eye they gain
in experience. • With experience comes the
ability to read the weather conditions
aright and transfer them to the rear-
sight. One of the best target-shots I’ve
seen was an elderly man with a palsied
right hand. How he managed to keep the
afflicted hand steady at the moment of
pressing the trigger he alone knew. But
I’m afraid that “K.’s” likening of target-
shooting to snap-shooting in the bush
would buy him a fight if uttered in the
presence of some fanatics I know. The
hours I’ve endured stoically listening to
learned discussions on trajectory and fish-
tail winds! And I’ll always remember
the earbashing an old chap gave me in
my youth. He started by explaining in
minute, scientific detail just what happens
“I get that, too —and do you Wake up feeling as if you re a hundred
years old ?”
in the decimal of a second from the time
the trigger is pressed until the bullet leaves
the muzzle. I still can’t see how all those
things could take place in less than
twenty minutes. In dead seriousness he
declared that the weight of a pencil could
bend the barrel; and after the third shot
the wood along the rifle warped away
from the heated steel and consequently
twisted the sights out of alignment. He
wound up with: “And those are the
things an experienced rifleman knows
and takes into consideration. Always
remember, son, age and experience will
always put it over youth and ignorance.”
He was right—l never saw again the tele-
scope I lent him.

“Solitude”: It came after a long
silence. “Sol.” “Yair?” “You got any
’bacca?” “Where’d / get any?” Seventy-
fiver heaved a sigh, tipped the contents
of a dilapidated packet on to the palm
of his hand and eyed it sorrowfully.
“Only two more smokes after t’night,”
he grieved, “an’ no more then for a
week.” “We’re down to our last bit of
bread, too,” I reminded him. “Go light
on it.” Mournfully he shook his head.
“If I cut it down to half a smoke a day
it’ll last four days.” “The bread’ll be done
long before then,” I pointed out, “and
there’s no flour.” We’d been caught on
the tops in a spell of bad weather and
were holding the mob till we could get
through. Next day we finished the bread
and everything else edible. “Isn’t there
any way out except the stream?” I in-
quired anxiously. Seventyfiver paused in
counting shreds of tobacco on to a paper.
“No,” he replied. “An’ I tell y’ half a
smoke ain’t much good to a man.’’ I
spelled my nag most of the following
day, and towards evening pulled my belt
up another hole and sought the old bloke.
“Going to have a shot at getting through
for supplies,” I told him. “Better give it
another day, Sol,” he advised thought-
fully. “Brown’ll never make that crossin’
t’night. Like as not y’ll git y’self
drownded, an’, anyway, I still got
enough for another half smoke yet.”

“Naturala”: A few remarks supple-
mentary to “B.A.K.’s” snail studies (B.
10/11/’4B). Snail’s eggs might easily be
transported by soil attached to the roots
of garden plants. Said eggs are of stiff
jelly, whitish, and at times of the size of
water-swollen sago. All snails lay eggs,
since both sexes are found in the one
body, or rather under the one shell.
Nevertheless, snails mate. Watch a lady-
gent. snail depositing eggs. He-she sinks
a posterior into loose soil and lays much
after the style of the turtle. Actually snail
eggs might pass for miniature turtle eggs,
both being of the same construction.
Snail eggs have remarkable power of sur-
vival. Even in sand that becomes so hot
with the summer sun as to be unbearable
to the naked foot they will survive, al-
though withered, to hatch out when
winter rains fall. Australia, of course,
had native snails, but these have long
been overshadowed by the imported.
Around Perth (W.A.) the landscape for
miles is infested with two varieties, the
large British brown snail and the white
Italian, much smaller but much more
prolific. The brown British seemingly
arrived with the First Fleet, but the Itie
came as a legacy of the No. 1 war. The
best bait for Helix is the Demon Drink —
bran moistened with alcohol both lures
and slays.

“Gravelsnatcher”: The 2in. centrifugal
pump had lain unused and rusting for
10 years when Bill the Goose spotted it
and offered to buy it—at a reasonable
price. He only wanted the pulleys and
bearings, but, although it was useless to
Smiley, the old miser asked a ridiculous
figure. “It ain’t what it’s worth ter me,”
he pointed out. “It’s what it’s worth ter
you.” The Goose was still simmering
some weeks later when Smiley came up
to where we were sitting beside the old
runabout having lunch. He was leading
a lame horse, and at sight of us he
brightened. Were we going into Bumper-
crop? We were. Good. He was in a
hurry, his horse had trodden on a stone,
and he’d make us an offer. If the Goose
would take him into town he’d give me
10 bob to lead his horse —a matter of five
miles. The Goose appeared to consider.
“Tell yer what,” he offered. “I’ll take y’
in fer two quid an’ me mate’ll lead yer
horse fer a quid.” Smiley swore and
pleaded, but the Goose was firm. “It ain’t
what it’s worth ter me,” he explained. “It's
what it’s worth ter you.” Smiley capitu-
lated. The money changed hands and
Smiley took charge. “Well,” he snapped,
“if I’m employin’ you blokes y’ better git
a move on. Y’ can finish yer lunch
later.” We packed up. I took the reins
and the Goose said “Well, come on. I’ll
take y’ in now. We’ve broken a back
axle an’ we were just havin’ a bite before
we walked in ter git a new one. Y’
ready?” Bumpercrop residents still talk
of how the Goose reached town a bare
five yards ahead of Smiley, who collapsed
on the pub steps. He was still shaky
when I led his horse in a couple of
hours later.

“Sirloin”: A fair droving effort was
accomplished by five girls between the
ages of 1§ and 25, who, riding on their
own, took 600 Herefords recently from
the Treasure homestead at Castleburn to
the Dargo High Plains (Vic.) for summer
grazing. Leader of the party was 23-
year-old Freda Treasure, who for a long
time has been'helping her two brothers
droving and mustering cattle. Her four
cousins rode with her. The 50-mile
journey with the slow-moving cattle took
them three days. It was covered in daily
stretches of about 15 miles. Food and
supplies were carried by packhorse. The
girls packed their own gear on their
saddles and camped in huts at Dargo and
Mt. Ewan on the way. Perhaps not a
very great feat so far as droving is
concerned in Australia, but it was the
girls"first experience of such a job.

“C.S.”: Two blokes—one big, the
other not so big—were tramping from
Conargo down to Deniliquin on a blaz-
ing day, cursing the heat, the dust, the
flies and the motorists who ignored them.
The hum of a car behind caused the big
bloke to look round: his face went sud-
denly grim and he violently attacked his
mate. His mate fought back, yelling pro-
fane and startled questions. Naturally,
the car pulled up. The big bloke got a
grip on his mate and turned an anxious
face toThe car. “It’s me mate,” he panted.
“Sun got him or somethin’. Went mad.
Tried to stab me with a pocket-knife an’
then tried t’ stab hisself. Got t’ get him
into hospital quick.” “Can you hold
him?” asked the driver doubtfully.
“Aw, I’ll hold him, all right.” And the
big bloke threw the little bloke —and their
swags—into the back seat. That’s how
we got into Deniliquin and down to the
river shade that blazing day.
INDEPENDENCE.
‘7 will think of the leech-gatherer on the
lonely moor.”
How the red road stretched before us, mile on
mile,
Narrowing into the distance, straight as though
ruled
On yellow paper, away to the lilac hills
Low on the horizon. Above them the storm-
clouds piled
In a sky blue as though bruised, yet all ahead
Was glowing in an unearthly wash of light,
Dry roly-poly and saltbush lit to beauty,
The sky a menace, but the wide plains bright.
And there in that lonely place an ancient swag-
man,
Traveller, bagman, sundowner, what you will,
His rolled-up blankets slung aslant his shoulders
Billy in hand, his back to the line of hills
And the coming storm; as mysterious in that
place,
,With his hat set straight and his grey beard
blowing,
As a small ship glimpsed a moment far from
land.
Where did he come from, where could he be
going?
I will never know, for we had to race the rain
That turns the blacksoil plains to a gluey mud
Bogging to the axles. Only a wave of the hand,
But still the imagination glows, the blood
Stirs at the memory of that symbolic stranger
Glimpsed in a moment of vision and swiftly
gone—
Man and his independent spirit, alone
On the vast plains, with night and rain coming
on.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO GRAZCOS."
Why Drenches Fail.
(Part 2.)
“J.R.D.”: A cause of drench-
ing failure (B. 24/11/ ’48) is due
to the sheep not getting enough
of the active constituent of the
drench to kill the worms. The
dose is estimated according to
bodyweight, and makers’ instruc-
tions should be closely followed.
An overdose of some drenches
may be fatal, but anything less
than the stipulated dose will
give only partial results.
Veterinary research goes on
continuously, and there are fre-
quent changes in the strength of
the dose, generally for an in-
crease. While some manufac-
turers may follow this, others
may not alter their printed
labels, and for this reason
drench-buyers should be careful
of extravagant claims.
Faulty can be
responsible for poor drenching
results. A graduated measuring-
cylinder should be used to check
the dose ejected by the gun.
Drenches of the suspension
types must be kept, thoroughly
mixed while being used. If the
undissolved matter settles to the
bottom of the tank the sheep
may be getting the correct
volume of liquid but not the
right amount of the drug. This
applies particularly to pheno-
thiazine, which is insoluble in
water.
Another cause of poor results
is failure to follow the first dose
with another at the correct time.
Most drenches are effective only
on adult parasites, and as the
organs may be full of immature
worms which will develop and
reach the breeding stage in en-
suing weeks, it is evident that
unless they are attacked the first
dose will have only a temporary
effect.
Faulty technique in adminis-
tration of the drench can cause
failure. With most modem
drenches there is no need to
yard sheep overnight or to
starve them before drenching.
Some, however, are effective
only if they reach that part of
the stomach or bowel where the
worms are and in sufficient
strength to kill them. Nicotine-
sulphate depends on being mixed
with bluestone to cause the
drench to be by-passed to the
fourth stomach. If it goes in-
stead to the paunch and mixes
with the bulky contents there it
will be too diluted when it
reaches the worms to do them
much harm. Careless use of the
gun will result in the drench
being held in the mouth and
spat out instead of being swal-
lowed. The nozzle should reach
over toward the back of the
tongue before the liquid is re *
leased. The animal s head should
rem am at normal elevation if
possible. If the head is dragged
hack so that the muzzle points
skywards the liquid will most
probably go down the windpipe
in *9 tb e lungs, causing choking,
suffocation, pneumonia or sud-
den death,

Shearing Troubles.
“Bungaree”: It is usually the
owner or manager who can
shear who is hardest to satisfy
(B. 17/11/’4B), because he
knows when a sheep is well
shorn and can appreciate the
difference between “good” and
“rough” sheep. The counting-
out pens are the mirror of each
man’s ability. Cobblers are
usually evenly distributed and
not all in one pen. Any shearer
who claims that his sheep are
tougher than his pen-mate’s is
only advertising his own in-
ability to pick the best sheep
when the catching-pen is full,
That recipe for more shearers
—“Owners should concentrate
on a line of good, plain, easy-
cutting sheep”—-is as one-eyed
as it is unpractical. Is a man
to grow sheep that will cut more
and better wool or merely to
satisfy shearers? If the latter
the pastoral industry would be
pushed back to 150 years ago
when Merinos were bare on
heads, bellies and legs and cut
less than half the weight of
modem sheep.
Many stations find it hard to
get shearers because their sheep
have a reputation for toughness.
Shearers shy off studs in spite
of higher rates, and the owner
of an all-wether shed seldom
gets a team unless he offers con-
cessions. “8.5.” claims that be-
cause graziers are getting high
prices for wool shearers are
justified in demanding free meat,
fares, etc. If the wool market
dropped 50 p.c. tomorrow would
“8.5.” voluntarily offer to shear
for 30s. per 100, 50 p.c. of the
current rate?
Hut accommodation and
general conditions have im-
proved vastly in the past 20
years, and there was need for it.
The old standard of accommo-
dation was deplorable. Most
shearers appreciate the improve-
ments, but wanton destruction
of buildings, fittings and ameni-
ties by a small larrikin element
has not improved relations be-
tween employers and employees.
“K.Mc.” has the final word:
I have “a line of good, plain,
easy - cutting sheep” (B.
17/11/’4B), plus new machines
and engine, good food and
quarters, grinding so g<?od no
shearer ever complains, award
rates and a good boss of the
board, yet I was dumped. The
trouble can be traced to (1)
graziers who offer blackmarket
rates which tempt men to break
their promises, and (2) shearers
who readily break their word to
gain a little extra money. When
a shearer’s word was his bond
and there were no blackmar-
keteers my shearers came back
year after year, though the sheep
were then rougher and the
machines old.
Poultry on the Farm.
“Mr.”: They’re usually
allowed to camp where they like,
lay where they like, pick up
what feed they can and inbreed
to such an extent that produc-
tion and physique deteriorate
rapidly. Even where the flock
is small it pays to cull and to
look after the good birds as well
as any other farm livestock.
Breed only from purebreds
of a proved laying strain. Pro-
duction can be raised or main-
tained at a profitable level only
by breeding from birds with
production above average. Don’t
breed from birds that did not
lay well as pullets ; are under-
sized ; less than 18 months old;
that do not conform to breed
characteristics or that lay a
large percentage of eggs under
2oz. If bred and fed right,
chicks hatched out in August-
September will begin laying in
, he following March . The fast
laying seasons are the most

are available from nurserymen,
and the planting season extends

Rearing Young Pigs.
“W. Court”; Heavy mortality
in newly-born pigs may be
caused by a germ which causes
swellings in the joints and lame-
ness. It generally occurs in dirty,
badly-drained yards. Once it has
appeared, however, it is a good
idea to pamt the navels of
newly-born pigs with iodine as
a deterrent to infection.
Similar symptoms appear in
cases of rickets The piglets are
suffering from lime deficiency,
and they should get ground lime-
stone with the feed. Each piglet
should get from ioz. to ioz of
lime per day. depending on age
and size
. ,
Paspaium-hay.
“E.H.S.”: There appears to be
a prejudice against converting
paspalum into hay, chiefly on
the ground that its nutritive
value is too low, but careful ex-
periments, both private and
otficial, have demonstrated that
when cut at the right stage of
growth the feeding value of pas-
palum-hay is high. The proper
time to cut is just before the
seed-heads appear. If delayed
until the seed is mature, nutritive
value is reduced and ergot may
be developed. When the hay is
harvested the land is in better
condition to produce the succu-
lent pasturage required by milk-
ing cows, and where the pasture
contains a fair percentage of
clover all classes of stock make
a rapid improvement in condi-
tion.
A War Casualty.
“J.W.M.”: British Friesian,
Monkton Bespeak, which gave
2407 gallons in 1947, and was
set for a 3000-gallon record in
1948, is dead. A post-mortem
revealed a three-inch piece of
wire in her heart. It came from
a German flying-bomb that ex-
ploded near her when she was
six years old. Owned by the
brothers Willett, of Birching-
ton, Kent, she was on special
fodder-treacle, bran mashes
and even eggs and brandy-as

in soil-conservation methods in
the U.S.A., said that from work
done in the Kingaroy district it
had been estimated that a pad-
dock could be contour-banked
with only one to one-and-a-half
times more effort than that
normally required to plough it.
The cost of treating the 15 acres
was about £24 —in full fertility
the land would be worth £2O
per acre. J. E. Ladewig, senior
soil-conservationist, pointed out,
however, that for the successful
control of erosion in any parti-
cular area it was essential to
have the co-operation of all
farmers in that area. Each had
to see that the maximum amount
of rainwater was retained on
his farm, and that unavoidable
run-off was transferred from the
property in such a manner that
it drained into group-drainage
patterns with the minimum loss
of soil.
Garden Drainage,
“Mozzer”: For best results
from a garden the soil should
be drained; in heavy soils it is
essential. Use unglazed earthen-
ware pipes of 2-jin. diameter in
trenches 4ft. deep, and on top
pack 3in. of rubble. This allows
surplus water to seep through
into the pipes and drain away
Space the 'pipes at 15yd. inter-
vals. Allow a fall of 1 in 100
and nm the pipes by the shortest
route to the lowest area.
Another method, not quite so
effective, is to lay stones or
quarry metal, with the rubble
over it, instead of pipes. Where
the fall of the land is steep
enough for natural drainage a
dry well dug in the lowest part
of the property should drain
surplus water.
Hints for the Farm.
“Ognop”: When planting
tomatoes push a Tin. stake in
alongside each plant. Put 4oz.
of perm.-pot. in a kero.->tin of
water and at fortnightly inter-
vals remove the stakes, fill the
holes with the liquid, wait until
it disappears and replace the
stake. I’ll guarantee that tomato
plants thus treated will never
contract wilt.
“Bat”: To repulse borers and
other pests on trees and shrubs
paint the trunks and larger
limbs with a mixture of of
quicklime, |lb. of copper-sul-
phate and four quarts of water.
Holes and tunnels should be
blocked.
“Myrr”: Beans, lettuce and
other summer-growers suscep-
tible to wind can be protected
by planting tall crops like sweet
corn, climbing beans and staked
tomatoes on the windward side.
A breakwind will give full pro-
tection from wind for a dis-
tance five times, and partial pro-
tection 15 times, its height. Rows
planted north and south will
suffer less from wind action.
“Nubis”: To clear muddy
water in drums or tanks sprinkle
gypsum over the surface. For
small tanks, lib. of gypsum to
200 gals. of water; for dams,
1001 b. to 250 cubic yards.
“Sarina”: To end dry-rot in
woodwork mix common salt
with boiling water until the
water will dissolve no more salt
and then wash the affected tim-
ber with the solution. Or the
timber may be sprinkled with
salt, and atmospheric moisture
will cause the salt to penetrate
the woodwork.
“W. Court”: The quickest
way to clean encrusted grease,
paint, etc., from the metal parts
of implements is to boil them
in a solution of caustic soda —
Jpb. to 2gals. of water. The
solution may be used repeatedly.
To get grease quickly off your
hands wash them in kerosene
and then under the tap.

"P HE mild Mr. Pepper took
I their class, and let them out
to rup their bruised hands under
the tap. The red marks were
turning purple, and in the wash-
room they had a little com-
panionship in woe. And hate.
Jimmy, although he didn’t feel
friendly enough to Butch to ask
him, wondered why Butch didn’t
get his brother, who was a
drover, to do something to Mr,
Stone, Make him dance to a
stockwhip, for instance, some
Monday morning, before the
whole school. Or duck him in
the horse-trough outside the
Royal.
These pleasing barbaric
fancies helped, eased the sick-
ness of the stomach ; and, back
in the classroom, Jimmy only
came out of them when a torn
sheet of paper was passed to
him.
He looked at it, under the
desk. It showed a stick figure
with hair poking up, being
bitten by a dog about the size
of a meat-ant. Beneath was
written “Dog-tamer Medlow.”
Jimmy gritted his teeth, rolled
the paper in a ball and threw it
on the floor.
Another piece was handed to
him and he crumpled that up,
too. But a few minutes later he
dropped his pencil beside it,
picked it up and unfolded it.
There was a gigantic bull-dog
with a boy—trousers and legs
only vanishing down its
dragon-like maw. On the seat
of the trousers was written
“Jimmy.” And, lest there be any
danger of ambiguity, “Dog-
tamer” was printed below.
Jimmy was hot and miserable
with shame. Dogs, damn dogs,
he told himself, staring at the
cover of his school magazine.
Nasty smelly nuisances, they
were, really. Always getting a
fellow into trouble. The joke
of the school, that’s what a bloke
is, the joke of the school. Mr.
Pepper was reading a library
book, it was half-hour’s reading
time, and Jimmy, considering
whether he would revenge him-
self on Mr. Stone, or Butch, or
Vhether he should, after all,
just leave town. Leave the
country, too, for that matter.
Join the Foreign Legion.
Mr. Stone popped in just be-
fore the class was dismissed.
“Excuse me, Mr. Pepper,” he
said, not even looking at Mr.
Pepper. “I’ve got a few words
to say to these boys. I’ve
punished two boys today—made
an example of them. One,
especially, who used language I
hope I won’t hear again here.
In fact” —an awful lowering of
the eyebrows, a tightening of
the blue chip —“I know I won’t.
Mr. Pepper”—the cold, dull-
grey eyes were turned on Mr.
Pepper now, and Mr. Pepper
turned pinker than ever —
“please give these boys some
detention. Give D’Arcy Car-
mody some sums. And Mr.
Dog-Tamer Medlow” Mr.
Stone permitted himself a smile ;
so everyone laughed —• “can
write out —well, let me see,”
Mr. Stone stroked his chin.
“Yes, our young canine-con-
troller can copy out the story
about the French beggar.” There
was a pretty wit in this, since
the story, in a roundabout way,
concerned a dog and a beggar
who was thrown to the hounds,
and the class roared with that
high laughter which conveni-
ently blends malice and con-
venience and the sheer delight
of letting loose animal sound.
“Good writing, mind,” said Mr.
Stone. “And no nonsense.”
The writing was wretched,
scrawly and smudged, but the
kind Mr. Pepper accepted it,
and Jimmy and Butch left to-
gether. The school deserted save
for a cleaner with bucket and
mop, Mr, Pepper quickly gone
with his book under his arm and
Butch and Jimmy walking
across the empty red playground
in the red sunset, comparing
their bruises,

inspected the thumb, a lively red
streak across the grime, and,
most likely, a lively throbbing
beneath it. Cow, all ngnt, he
agreed. Still, in his mortmca-
tlQn he could have wished for
something more terrible to show
for himself, Jpot that Mr. Stone
hurt he always did.
The bastard. Jimmy said it
aloud, between his teeth, and
Butch looked up with an ap-j
proving glint in his green eyes.i
Hatred gave them something of
a common feeling as they
tramped across the red
ground under the slanting
shadows of the pepper- and
kurrajong-trees. A comradeship

they felt was not misery but a
retrospective enjoyment of its
pangs ; some real throbs, too, of
Pam and the longing for food
that always descended on them
at this time of afternoon, and
m® baffled feeling ail young
things experience after dealing
wlt h powerful adult forces.
Tenderly—a little theatrically
—Jimmy pushed open the small
silver-frosted gate and they
marched out into the larger air
of Mason’s-lane, still comrades.
A famous place, Mason’s-lane,
steeped in tradition and thick
with burrs, the venue of im-
memorial affairs of honor and
revenge, and deeply rutted and
winding in two corrugated-iron
flanked loops to the proud red
“ Half-a-mo while I go and douse the light."
brick of the Anglican Church at
the corner. Swaying grey posts,
and blady-grass, and thorns and
thistles from Mason’s vacant
allotment —where the rusted
skeleton of a Header, and torn
. tarpaulin of an ancient tourer
reared from a sea of grass—
heavily intruded.
“Y’re dopey, y’ know,” Butch
said abruptly, staring at Jimmy
with candid green eyes. “You
and y’ dawgs,” he spat into the
greedy dust. “Mad as a cut
snake.”
“Aw,” Jimmy looked heavily
at Butch. “Not half as mad as
you.” But there was no spirit
in the reply. He began to
think, in a shamefaced, furtive
way, that Butch might be right,
A little right, anyway. What
was the good of dogs, after all,
if only trouble came from
them?
Then Jimmy saw the black-
and-white sheep-dog that he had
caught a glimpse of last Tues-
day with the drover’s plant.
Nearly all black, with a bit of
white at the throat, and light,
clear, rather scornful brown
eyes. Not a town dog, this, but
a worker, with curved ribs
showing under the rough black
coat —dulled, now, with dust,
and with knots and burrs—and
with a tireless easy lope and a
great contempt for small boys
who tried to scrape up an ac-
quaintance.
The dog was coming towards
them, round the curve of corru-
gated-iron, and when he saw
them he changed his mind,
stopped, and then, as though to
show his contempt, sat down
and scratched.
“Here, boy,” Jimmy said,
“Here.” He snapped his fingers,
the black pricked ears twitched
forward, the calm brown eyes
blinked. Then the rough, thick
neck twisted round and the dog
snapped at a fly with sudden
savagery.
‘ < L_f ERE, boy,” Jimmy said,
* l not at all offended, and
whistled, a low, penetrating
sound with a little tremble to
it. The ears pricked forward
again, and this time the dog
followed, loping over easily and
swiftly. Jimmy ran his fingers
over the rough head, cleverly
massaged the spot behind the
ears. The black dog sat down,
stared distantly at the rising red
battlements of the Church of
England church; but now and
then, in a slow, absentminded
sort of way, his black tail
thumped against the dust.
Jimmy looked around at
Butch in sly triumph.

Precept.
“A six-man Tibetan trade mission
which arrived in Britain to try to
arrange a barter deal in yaks’-tail hair
caused headaches to the management
of its London hotel because of its
peculiar culinary requirements.”
The mission, having just
brought off a brilliant deal with
Burma, was right on its eco-
nomic toes.
At Rangoon, I Saw, the
Burmese Deputy-Director of
Post-Revolution Planning, fol-
lowing a custom observed in
Australia, had given orders to
Damn Saw, the Minister for
Trade, and Rip Saw, the Minis-
ter for Adverse Trade Balances,
to join him in working out a
trade agreement with the Tibetan
mission.
The Tibetans, as a special
concession, offered to supply
Burma with yaks’ tails in ex-
change for teak logs on a quid
pro quo log-for-tail basis, and
stressed the great value of yaks’-
tail hair in the making of false
beards. The Saws, who weren’t
very sharp, vaguely knew the
value of the quid owing to the
long British association. The
pro quo they thought was the
usual bribe, and held out their
hands. These the Tibetans
warmly shook and took the Saws
across to the pub to lubricate
them, which was less expensive
than greasing them. Perhaps
what had influenced the Burmese
most, however, was the thought
of the great advantage of false
beards, especially for high-ups,
in a Communist State.
When they reached London
the mission quickly settled into
its West End hotel, pronounc-
ing themselves, as best they could
pronounce, eminently satisfied
with the flavor of the bathwater.
The management, at great ex-
pense and in anticipation of the
visit, had combed England for
starlings’ brains and the breasts
of blue-eyed weasels, the tradi-
tional Tibetan delicacy which is
“ Don't worry, sir. EVERYTHING'S going to come out
all right”.
stewed in yaks’ blood. When
this epicurean delight was placed
before them the Tibetans waved
it away and ordered seven help-
ings each of Irish stew, followed
by fried oranges, anchovies on
fruit cake and topped- off with
Yarmouth bloaters and choco-
late ice-cream. It was when they
ordered, instead of black coffee,
cocoa in which milk was re-
placed with corned-beef drip-
ping that the despairing head-
waiter tried unsuccessfully to
suicide by hacking at his jugular
with one of the table-knives.
After filling in 314 forms and
jousting with an army of
assistant under-secretaries the
mission succeeded at last in see-
ing Sir Kippered Snacks,
Britain’s economic dictator, who.
with such inflexible purpose,
was pursuing the Government’s
slogan: “Genteel Poverty For
All.”
The leader of the Tibetan
mission, getting to grips at onee,
stressed the economic* value to
Britain of yaks’-tail hair, which
would be invaluable in the
manufacture of mattresses for
penitents; their excellence for
use by school pupils in splitting
headmasters’ canes would also
prove of great benefit. He sug-
gested they barter a quantity of
yaks’-tail hair to be determined
in exchange for a power-house
complete with smoke-stacks, a
minaret, swimming pool and a
carillon.
Side-tracking them tactfully
off the barter road, Sir Kippered
launched enthusiastically into a
recital of the blessings of social-
ism. He pointed with great pride
to the fact that this year his
country’s nationalised airways
had lost £11,000,000 sterling,
£1,000,000 more than last year.
“In what private concern?”
asked Sir Kippered ecstatically,
“could one find losses such as
that leaping ahead with such
bounding health?” Sir Kip-
pered recalled the initial alarm
that the Government had felt
when it was feared that the first
year might result in a profit and
thus upset all socialist teaching.
The appointment of several hun-
dred more party supporters to
, , . . . x _ , ,
the administrative staff had,
however, quickly remedied the
position.
The mission listened patiently,
and when Sir Kippered momen-
tarily paused to take a deep
breath the Tibetan leader got in
and suggested that a deal might
also be made profitably to both
countries by exchanging Tibetan
dried goats’ udders and pre-
served rushes for use in atom-
smashing cyclotrons, miniature
racing cars or synthetic haggis
manufacturing,
Sir Kippered immediately
started off with a flowery
description of his great scheme
to nationalise the diaper-making
industry. Under nationalisa-
tion, if it followed the usual
trend, as he was confident it
would, diapers would immedi-
ately become very scarce and ex-
pensive, The long-range effect
of this would be to discourage
mothers from having babies;
this in turn would greatly ease
Britain’s acute food problem.
“Could socialism’s planned
economy give a more perfect ex-
ample of clear and logical
thinking?” he asked.* Also, the
profits which the greedy diaper-
manufacturers used to put in
their own and their shareholders’
pockets would in future go
back to the people in the form
of accumulated deficits.
Several more efforts were
made by the Tibetans to get a
barter deal in yaks’-tail hair
going, but each time Sir Kip-
pered opened the gates of his
eloquence and flooded them
with fresh evidence of the
manner in which Britain’s
socialist Government was effect-
ing bigger and better losses in
its trading ventures.
Under the combined effects of
the Irish stew and Sir Kippered’s
persistent hammering for the
Cause the Tibetans at last
cracked. They returned to Tibet
full of the blessings of social-
ism.
Need it be added that the
newly - appointed Director -
General of Tibet’s nationalised
yaks’-tail hair industry is the late
secretary of the Yaks’-tail Hair-
pluckers’ Union, and that the
first year under the new set-up
is expected to see production
down 50 p.c., the price to the
Tibetan public up 125 p.c., the
Director-General’s salary up
500 p.c. and the deficit on trad-
ing several million sangs (in
Tibetan currency four sangs
equals three songs, three songs
equals two madrigals, two
madrigals equals one lama, one
lama equals half a yak)?

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
4£d. per line; all others 2£d. per line.
Liberal v. Labor
I don’t think the Liberals are unwise
in only vaguely defining their policy (J 3.
20/10/’4B). It dpesn’t do for a party to
have too clearcut a platform. Circum-
stances sometimes necessitate conduct that
might be contrary to a too concretely-
stated plank, and thus leave fhe party
open to the charge of lacking principle.
There was wisdom in George Saints-
bury’s contention that the old English
party names, Whig and Tory, were better
than the newer Liberal and Conservative.
They allowed more latitude. A policy
could be adopted that, to the critically-
minded, would seem inappropriate to a
party with such a definite label as Liberal
or Conservative. Thousands of votes
have been gained by the Australian,
British and New Zealand Labor parties
that would never have been theirs had
they been labelled Socialist.
Menzies’s party erred in taking the
name Liberal. The older U.A.P. and
Nationalist were better. The party is not
even a Liberal one like the English Liberal
party, but a coalition of various elements
opposed to Socialism. — Tom (N.S.W.).
Olives
The 2700-acre olive plantation being
established on the western slopes of the
Victorian Grampians proves that S.A. has
not a monopoly (B. 3 /1J / ’4B). Plenty of
sunshine, an annual rainfall of 23.5 in.
and an abundance of seepage to moisten
the clay loam which overlays the calceous
sub-stratum combine to make the Vic-
torian area an ideal site. The many uses
for olive oil ensure a good market. It
can be used in soap and cosmetics, dyes,
plastics—industrially as well as medicin-
ally. And when Australian palates are
educated it may find a market as edible
oil.
Although in its infancy, plans for the
Grampians project include a distillery for
processing olives from 65,000 trees, and
a “walnut drive” around the boundaries
of the property. Olive trees planted three
years ago are already bearing, though not
commercially. In the meantime crops of
almonds, passion-fruit, watermelons and
vegetables help to bring in some return.
The slow return is the drawback to
olive cultivation, particularly as a rehab,
venture. There is no return before the
sixth year, and it is 10 years before the
tree reaches maturity and full bearing.
And although in 10 years’ time the plan-
tation should be well established and
flourishing, that’s too long for most
people to wait.
Consequently, for the small man, olives
are a better proposition as a sideline.
After six years, with both the eating olive
and olive oil (it is better to grow these
separately), 601 b. of fruit per tree should
be obtained—l92olb. from 32 trees to the
acre. Even at 6d. per lb. (the pre-war
price was 25.) the gross return would be
£4B per acre. At 10 years, a reasonable
expectation is 2001 b. of fruit per tree, a
handsome profit on capital outlay.—
Carlyle (Vic.).
Science and Food
I was not relying on “theory rather
than fact” when I wrote that a raw sub-
soil can be restored to full fertility in as
little as 10 years by modern methods (B.
3/11/ ’4B).
Briefly, here is the method as used in
our better-rainfall areas. (1) Contour-
plough the badly-eroded area. (2) Sow
it with a pasture legume such as sub.
clover. (3) Topdress it with at least a
bag of super, to the acre, to which has
been added the necessary trace elements,
usually copper, zinc and molybdenum.
(4) No matter how great the temptation
is to graze it, keep stock, including rab-
bits, off it for a few years. It must also
have an annual topdressing of super,
alone thereafter, except for the few pounds
of trace elements as well every five years.
For a few years the clover does little
more than thicken up, but in the fourth
or fifth year the change begins. The
soil becomes darker in color because of
the nitrogen put into it by the legume,
and humus is present in it; from then
on its character becomes steadily more
like a loam, and the pasture-growth on
it becomes thicker and stronger. By the
tenth year there is no evidence that it
was once a bare, badly eroded area.
Landowners all over southern Australia
are now restoring eroded land in this
way and they are doing it because it pays.
If “J.W.R.” wants to know what is being
done in his own country, thanks to the
C.S.I.R. and the Waite Institute, he
should stop reading about American
methods and study the pamphlets put
out in Australia. Or he could travel
around and see for himself. That’s what
I did. — H, A. Lindsay (S.A.).
The Maori
Maoriland Prime Minister ' Peter
Fraser (whose party’s ascendancy in the
House is assured by the four Maori seats)
prides himself on all that has been done
in the last few years for M.L.’s native
race. He has reason to pride himself on
some things—t.b. control among Maoris,
for instance—but here are some other
aspects.
The Prisons Report 1946-47 states that
“With the Maori population 5.8 per cent,
of the whole, 20 per cent, of those
admitted to the prisons belong to the
Maori racp.” And listen to Mr. Justice
Blair: “The increasing proportion of
Maori offenders seemed to indicate that
many Maoris were degenerating into a
class of criminals —a terrible thing to
happen to a very fine race like the Maori
people,”
And J, H. Luxford, S.M.: “Young
Maoris coming into the cities are lapsing
into careers of crime When the
courts are opened each day there are
more Maoris—or part-Maoris—brought
in than Europeans.” ,
Most thoughtful Maorilanders feel that
social security—or the overdoing or abuse
of it—is largely to blame for the present
sorry position. Ten shillings a week per
child means real money to most Maoris
with their unrestricted families (ironical
souls dub it “sexual” instead of “social”
security).
Another factor in the increase of crime
and delinquency among Maoris in the
cities is the lack of decent housing.
Whole families and relatives are herded
into hovels (19 in three rooms being all-
too-common), sometimes even without
cold water, yet many of the Maoris make
valiant efforts to keep clean. Manpower
direction brought the natives into the
towns in droves during the war when
factories had to have labor at any cost.
Now the Maori won’t leave the regular
hours, good pay and two-day week-end
for the chancy seasonal work he used to
get in the country.
The Maori in the city is torn from his
ancient way of living, under which he
would have been part of the life of the
pah. Life then was communal; wise
elders advised the young, and there was
a sense of security arising from the tribal
life. Now there is none of that. The
city Maori is a cog in a machine. His
racial instinct for communal life, which
gives a sense of “belonging,” is -unful-
filled. Leaving his hovel, he goes on to
the streets, into the billiard-rooms and
the pubs and the downward trend begins.
There is still much to be done before
Maoriland’s “Labor” party can say, it has
really safeguarded, let alone uplifted, the
Maori. — Una Auld (N.S.W.).
Control of Hides
To ensure that enough hides remain in
Australia and to keep prices at a reason-
able level, the Federal Government does
not intend to lift the present control over
prices.
There is something to be said for ex-
“Cheer up, Madam — SHE scores off the men
in the later chapters
port restrictions. But, under the present
system of control, prices for hides are
so low that they are defeating the control
purpose—thousands of tons of hides are
wasted yearly. Butchers must skin a
beast, and as long as the hide will pay
for salt, freight and handling they will
sell —but farmers and cattlemen are in a
different position. For one thing, be-
cause farm and station hides are not
taken off so well, nor so well looked after
as hides in the slaughter-houses, they
usually bring a much lower price.
Hides have seldom been a very profit-
able line for the farmer or cattleman.
Never since the boom after the First
World War have they risen above bread-
and-butter level. Just now, under con-
trol from Canberra, they don’t even come
within cooee of that.
World prices are up to 300 per cent,
above our best. The Government pays
the Australian market a bonus on the
profit made from the sale of hides over-
seas, but even with that present prices
for farm and station hides are not as
good as they were in the hungry ’thirties.
In the middle of that decade, when we
were scarcely out of the depression, farm
hides would give an average return of
threepence per pound or a little better.
Today the quality has to be well up to
give a return of fourpence per pound to
the consignor, but out of that the average
man pays a pound in every four in taxes.
With coarse salt twice the price of salt
in the ’thirties and labor and freights
much dearer, the farmer is on a
losing proposition consigning hides. So
beasts that meet with accidents, starvers
and unwanted calves are burned with
their hides. — Ardizan (Q.).
Housing Shortage?
The Commonwealth ‘Government
Statistician’s analysis of the 1947 Census
returns relating to occupied dwellings and
population indicates that there is no real
housing shortage.
The census return showed that 747,666
dwellings in N. S. Wales were occupied
by 2,984,838 persons, or 3.992 persons
per occupied dwelling. Actually the posi-
tion would have been even slightly better
because returns showed 17,392 unoccu-
pied dwellings, many of which were re-
ported as such because census collectors
were unable to find any occupier at home
during the hours at which they called.
In 1933 the figure was 4.336 persons
per occupied dwelling and in 1921 it was
4.804.
In other words, fewer people are occu-
pying each available house: that in spite
of the overcrowding of some houses, par-
ticularly in many homes where the
younger people have grown to adult
status, married and for want of other
accommodation have brought home their
husband or wife, and have added children
in due course. Many homes contain a
dozen or more people under these con-
ditions.
That means that other homes contain
one or two people, and a good deal of
vacant accommodation that could be
made available to needy youngsters.
Why is such accommodation hoarded,
as it were, by the few? Largely because
bitter experience during the last few years
has proved that undesirable tenants or
sub-tenants, once in possession, are much
harder to shift than white-ants!
Tenancy rules are so harsh and un-
bending and so much in favor of the
tenant that elderly people and those who
value their peace of mind hesitate before
admitting some stranger to the house.
They have been stung too often and
without redress. Nominally, an aggrieved
owner may ask a Court for repossession
of his premises, but the chances that he
will succeed are very slim.
The position would be eased if the Gov-
ernment amended the Tenancy Laws
making it possible for owner-occupiers to
ensure a proper measure of
control over their co-
tenants. Jindivick
(N.S.W.).
I see that 100,000 dis-
placed persons will be
welcomed to Australia
within the next 18 months
when thousands of
natural-born Australians
are already without homes.
The sudden increase of
population by a huge in-
flux of Europeans can do
nothing but create new
slums, increase the black-
market in the housing busi-
ness, and decrease the
already low Australian
birthrate. What Govern-
ment can expect Australian
women to bear children
when they :are denied a
home in which to raise
them?
When we were married
three and a half years
ago we aimed to have a few young-
sters. So far we’ve had none.
After my husband was discharged from
the Army we spent six months in a
boarding-house. Next we graduated to
rooms, which were cramped and uncom-
fortable, and where we usually spoke in
whispers and walked on our toes. After
18 months of that I had a breakdown.
At one stage we applied for a Housing
Commission cottage, but were told that
we didn’t have a hope because we had no
children.
Recently we were fortunate enough to
find a flat. It was small, but - self-con-
tained and soundproof. As we were
about to sign the contract for a year’s
lease, the owner remarked that he was
letting us the flat because we had no
children to “knock it about.”
Unfortunately our case is not unique.
Everywhere Australian people are living
under appalling conditions, in garages,
rooms, Army huts and even tents. Yet
the Government thinks it a fit time to add
100,000 extra people to the population.—
Australienne (N.S.W.).
T.B.
The erection in S.A. of a £30,000
factory to employ former t.b. sufferers
should retard the deathrate. The inci-
dence of t.b. is increasing, but the propor-
tion of deaths to the number of cases
notified is not. In other words preven-
tive measures have been good, while
little advancement has been made in
curative treatment.
In spite of reports purporting to show
that married pensioners are able to re-
ceive £7 ss. a week tax free, the actual
income of most invalids is below the
basic wage. The desire to be useful and
earn more money is overwhelming and
destructive. In my own case, three times
in eight years I pitted my strength against
the competitive field of labor, and three
times broke down.
This new factory achieves a long am-
bition of the S.A. Tuberculosis Associa-
tion. It will be modern in machinery
and equipment and will include a dust-
extraction plant, rest-rooms, canteen and
nurse attendant’s room- Doctors will
state whether a man is fit to work from
four to 40 hours a week. The staff will
consist of either patients or ex-patients,
and their rehabilitation into, independent
citizens will be careful and complete.
Products will be sold on the business
principles of quality and price, sentiment
excluded. There is no possible chance of
the goods carrying infection to the pur-
chaser.
For such a modest sum why hasn’t
something been done before? The S.A.
Government has contributed to the cost
on a pound-for-pound basis. If the Com-
monwealth Government is interested in
health schemes, it could make this prac-
tical move in other States. — Effective
(S.A.).
Trees and Farming
Judged by his statement that “ ‘burning
the brushing’ is still prevalent, particu-
larly in the hilly banana country,”
“K.A.S.” (B. 22/9/’4B) would remedy
soil erosion by stopping all pastoral and
agricultural activity.
How would any crop be grown if the
country were not first cleared and the
rubbish burned off? How would we get
improved pastures without first destroying
the timber and cultivating the topsoil?
The men who cut down the trees, burn
’em off and then replant the area with
some useful crop arc not enemies of the
country. Without them it wouldn’t be
worth tuppence. It’s the men who de-
stroy timber along stream-banks and in
places where the land cannot be suc-
cessfully worked who are doing the harm.
—Plane Creek (Q.).
Law
The annual report of the Appoint-
ments Board of 'Melbourne University
warns that graduates in Arts, other than
women who have prepared themselves
for posts as confidential secretaries, may
find it difficult to secure worth-while jobs
for the next two or three years, while
many law, commerce and science gradu-
ates will have to find employment outside
their professions. Engineers and gradu-
ates in agricultural science, architecture,
medicine, veterinary science and dentistry
have many good jobs awaiting them.
The Law Institute of Victoria is trying
to arrange articles for about 70 students
expected to complete their courses this
year, and fears that very soon the pro-
fession will be as overcrowded as before
the war. In 1939 young lawyers were
being employed in solicitors’ offices tor
£3 a week, while others were unable to
get a job at that figure.
It is a mystery to me why parents con-
tinue to push their sons into law m
which the average annual income in
Victoria in 1939 was nearer £5OO than
£lOO0 —while there are such bright pros-
pects in civil engineering, land surveying,
veterinary science, local government and
dentistry. Law is a hard and constant
job, and,, even today, any solicitor earn-
ing round £2O a week is generally work-
ing overtime on most nights.—Duti-
galla (Vic.).


last works in the small ensemble forms,
two of which —the String Quartet in G
Major, Op. 161, last of the series of 15,
and the Piano Trio in B Flat Major, Op.
99—were given by the Musica Viva
Society at Sydney Conservatorium.
The Quartet was composed when
Schubert was 30, the year before he died.
This work, played by violinists Robert
Pikler and Edward Cockman, violist
Richard Goldner and ’cellist Theo Salz-
man, demonstrates the composer’s
tremendous progress in his chamber-work
technique. The pattern-weaving from
the fine thematic material, the maturity
of style and the ingenious shifting of
balances between the various groups—-
these are a constant source of delight,
and the work lost nothing in the playing.
A feature of the Piano Trio was the
effortless and beautifully-judged playing
of the piano part by Maureen Jones.
Schumann’s description of the work as
“passive, feminine, lyrical” seemed only
true as to the latter quality. Certainly
the work hasn’t the drama and mascu-
linity of the Op. 100 Trio, but as played
by the pianiste, Robert Pikler and Theo
Salzman, it had no suggestion qf pas-
sivity in it. It has delicacy rather than
femininity. The lyrical quality came out
in the flowing rich andante. The tripping
vivacity of the rondo brought out en-
semble playing of quite a high standard.
"Corroboree."
“F.S.”: According to the programme
of the final subscription concert of the
Melbourne Symphony Orchestra under
Eugene Goossens’s baton, at the Town
Hall, John An till got the inspiration for
his “Corroboree” ballet from a boyhood
visit to “the aborigine settlement among
the sandhills on the north shore of
Botany Bay.” There he witnessed a cere-
mony of dances and wrote down the
melodies and rhythms when he got home.
I knew that aborigine settlement well
20 years before Mr. Antill. It was known
as the blacks’ camp, and I crossed it every
day on my way to the cable-station at
La Perouse for two years.
If the composer heard any of the
sounds described in his opus coming from
that collection of tin shanties the place
must have suffered an intervening revolu-
tion. All the instrumental noises I can
remember came from the street organ
from which the grey-haired lady mis-
sionary extracted a wheezy interpretation
of the Old Hundredth on Sundays, and
the strains of the “Merry Widow” waltz
from a mouth-organ in the possession of
an aged abo. who was the camp virtuoso.
The only part of their tradition that
was left to the native population was the
extraordinarily keen eyesight which en-
abled them to perceive a shoal of king-
fish from their lookouts long before any
white fisherman could spot them. Their
only art was the skill with which they
rushed their nets out in a wide arc and
encompassed several tons of fish in a few
minutes. Their nearest approach to a
corroborefe was the screaming women
tossing the fish up on to the sand, the
boys and girls shrieking with delight and
struggling but of the writhing welter of
sharks, stingrays, electric eels and whatnot
with kingies bigger than themselves
clasped to their stomachs, while the older
youngsters stood chest-deep outside the
nets deftly spearing and tossing back the
edible fish as they escaped through rents
in the enclosure.
It is doubtful if even the oldest
members of the tribe had ever heard of
a witchetty grub totem, while the only
ritual fire dance known to the younger
generation was the monthly hop in the
camp hall where the two dusky camp
belles, Adelaide and Sydney, ran away
with the show on one occasion by appear-
ing in full ball dress regalia borrowed
from the cable-station.
The abo, camp at La Perouse would
have been good subject-matter for a
musical composition, but it certainly
wasn’t the inspiration for Mr. Antill’s,
which was played with tremendous vigor
by the Melbourne orchestra on the usual
instruments, plus a slapstick, Chinese
temple-blocks, a thunder sheet and bull-
roarers. It impressed the present listener,
however, as being like one of those
dialect stories in which the author
endeavors to give an effect of realism by
copying the peculiarities of accent of his
characters so carefully that you don’t
know what they’re saying.
Three other first performances in Vic-
toria or Australia were Haydn’s “School-
master” symphony, the Bloch Concerto
for Violin and Orchestra, the solo part
of which was finely played by Adam
Kriegel, and the Roy Harris Symphony,
No. 3, in one movement, which had the
unusual merit of sounding as if it stood
on its own feet and, though quite tradi-
tional in cut, didn’t consist of snippets of
other people’s music.
"The Magic Flute."
Almost before the Italian dust had
settled at Melbourne His Majesty’s
Gertrude Johnson’s National Theatre
Movement was raising it at the Princess.
Mozart’s opera, with its half-mad
libretto, its Masonic symbolism, its magic
snakes, the subtlety of its music and its
delicate orchestration, and its need of a
soprano who can take high F, is a diffi-
cult proposition. The N.T.M. carried it
off with great distinction —in fact, much
more thought seemed to have been put
into marrying music, spectacle and drama
than is seen in most professional produc-
tions.
Stefan Haag, who was also the pro-
ducer, put all the Mozartian liveliness,
gaiety and wit into the part of the bird-
catcher, Papageno, and John Dudley, an
experienced operatic singer, gave Tamino,
the handsome hero, a voice with a fine
human note about it and dignity of pur-
pose.
As the brutal Moor Monostatos, Frank
Mithen pursued the beautiful Pamina
(Barbara Wilson) with a ferocity that was
rather comic, while Ina Crouch uttered
the revengeful threats of the Queen of
the Night so sweetly that they sounded
like benedictions. Keith Neilsen gave
nobility and some faulty low notes to the
High Priest of Isis.
Under Herman Schildberger’s baton
the orchestra was lively,’ bright and much
more considerate to the singers than are
some.
Ballet Rambert.
It isn’t often choreographers deal with
the real problems or, rather, try to de-
scribe them. They are much more at
home with comic nursery themes like
“The Nutcracker Suite” of Tschaikowsky,
which concluded the programme at the
reopening of the Rambert Ballet at Mel-
bourne His Majesty’s; the peccadilloes of
the gods, which are so remote that we
can’t feel them, as in “The Descent of
Hebe” of Anthony Tudor; or stories of
little girls who bring their picture-books
to life, as in the “Carnival of Animals”
of Andree Howard. The Ballet Rambert
is extremely adept at these sorts of sub-
jects and their audiences love them, but
they leave an impression of gimcrackery
behind them.
Walter Gore’s “Winter Night,” which
had its world premiere the other evening,
was in a different category. Gore has
apparently been thinking about the age-
old problem of the Lover and the Loved,
and how it is much more difficult for
the Loved, who can’t feel any concern
for the Lover, than it is for the Lover,
who is all concern. It was set to Rach-
maninoff’s music. Gore was the Loved
who can’t reconcile his desire for the new
girl (Paula Hinton) with his idea of loyalty
to the old one, and Sally Gilmour was
the Lover whose naggings and complain-
ings make it more difficult for the Loved
to maintain his concern and make it
easier for him to go off with the new
attraction.
It was all danced with an intensity the
co. has never shown before, and Miss
Gilmour, as usual, displayed her rare
capacity to identify herself with a sub-
ject. The simple backcloth with a few
lines and colors on it was much more
effective than the awful pseudo-modern
settings the company affected in its other
numbers.
Railways
In the U.S.A., where railroads are run
by private companies, the challenge of
tie airways has been accepted, and in-
endmg travellers are actually attracted
wains by their speed, comfort and
service. A train journey is something to
be enjoyed. Even freight trains in that
country attain speeds of 90 miles an hour.
On a recent trip on the so-called
Melboume-Adelaide “express,” at one
of the many stopping-places I had a talk
with the enginedriver, who said his maxi-
mum permitted speed was 60 miles per
hour. From Melbourne to Serviceton
the train is drawn by four A2-type loco-
motives —two from Melbourne to Ararat,
and two from Ararat to Serviceton. These
A2s, which still do the bulk of the pas-
senger work of the Victorian railways,
are at least 35 years old, the last having
been put into service in 1913.
In S.A. things are better, with powerful
Pacific- and mountain-type locomotives
hauling the Overland, but even then the
time for the 460 miles is 14 hours, and
that with no dining-car. “Meals” con-
sist of sandwiches and coffee snatched
at Ballarat, Serviceton or Murray Bridge,
provided you’re not knocked down in the
rush.
Sleeper accommodation is comfortable
but limited, and 90 per cent, of the
travellers sit up all night in straight-
backed seats, the design of which hasn’t
been improved in living memory.
In Australia train travel attracts no one
and is a torture to be endured in the
process of getting from one place to
another. Compare it with the brief de-
scription by “D.PJ.” (B. 10/11/ ’4B) of
the pleasures of modern air travel, and
you know why our railways are bankrupt.
—Dutigalla (Vic.).
Root of the Matter
There’s no imminent danger of the
Reds disturbing the even tenor of the
P.M.G.’s Department (B. 15/9/’4B). The
seniority rule presents a nut the Commos
can’t crack. There are ardent and noisy
Reds within the Department, but I have
yet to meet one ready to lay the fruits
of 30, even 10, years’ service in the lap
of the Cause. Unrest undoubtedly exists
within the postal service, and extreme
Leftists are trying to control the Amal-
gamated Postal Workers’ Union, but that
great protector of the incompetent the
seniority rule, abetted by the magic state
of permanency and the Superannuation
Act, keeps the political color of the Com-
monwealth Public Service a shade no
deeper than faded pink.—P. O. M. C.
(N.S.W.).
“Motorist” believes the Liberal and
Country parties “would gain thousands
of votes” if they came out with definite
proposals to disgorge the petrol tax for
road purposes (B. 17/11/’4B). In April,
1947, N. S. Wales Country party-leader
Bruxner said, “The Country party be-
lieves the petrol tax should be reduced to
7d. a gallon and the whole of the pro-
ceeds used for road construction and
maintenance.” That was plain enough,
but it didn’t “gain thousands of votes”
—the electors were too mesmerised by
McGirr’s dazzling promises. In 1946
Fadden gave an unequivocal promise to
cut taxation by £35 million, to make £5
million available to repair war-time
damaged roads, to refund the wool grab,
the wheat grab and the butter grab; but
all that didn’t gain many thousands of
votes. The electors were too engrossed
with Chifley’s Golden Age.—F. D.
(N.S.W.).
Before the war 9in. by 4in. manilla
envelopes cost threepence a packet of
25; today envelopes of inferior quality
cost Is. a packet. Cost of paper and
labor has increased, of course, but surely
not by 400 per cent. —W. P. T. (N.S.W.).
Why don’t radio stations broadcast
bagpipe music? The only time one ever
hears it is for about two seconds during a
well-known advertisement for pills. Be-
fore the war every capital city boasted
a Scottish regiment, and thousands of
young men grew up stirred by the skirl
of the pipes. We have recordings by
Guards battalion bands galore, so why
not something from the pipe bands of the
Black Watch or the Argyll and Suther-
lands? —X Gordon Highlander (Vic.).
There are grounds for objection to the
alteration in the boundaries of the Martin
(N.S.W.) Federal electorate. When the
distribution commissioners made their
original redistribution scheme, this par-
ticular constituency was to extend from
Drummoyne to Mortlake, thus embracing
a group of adjoining suburbs with strong
community of interest. The sitting
member complained that he had been de-
prived of “Gladesville, the Labor core of
my electorate.” This was not restored,
but in compensation the western portion
of the electorate was taken away and to
the remainder were added Balmain and
Rozelle, though an arm of the Parra-
matta River separates them from Drum-
moyne and they had never been part of
the old Martin electorate. The seat has
t|ius been made a gift to Labor. The
original boundaries must have been
arrived at after mature consideration, and
I hate to think that the commissioners,
all permanent civil servants of high stand-
ing, have been persuaded to act against
their better judgment.— Elector (N.S.W.).
Felllowship of Writers
o
“Do we come under a different award when We cross into
West Australia?”
the reading public more conscious of
the existence of Australian books.
There was always a refreshing, friendly
Australian atmosphere present at its well-
attended meetings and functions, and a
true fellowship existed between its older
and younger members. At any ordinary
meeting or function one would meet a
score or more writers whose names were
household words to readers of Australian
books. In short, the Fellowship was the
leading and most influential cultural
society in Sydney, and it was a privilege
to be a member and share in the good
work that was being done for Australian
literature.
The Fellowship of today, however,
bears no resemblance to the Fellowship of
10 years ago. It has long passed its zenith
and now has Communist affiliations.
Many of its leaders are Comrades, fellow-
passengers or minor writers who are un-
decided as to what camp they belong. A
few of the old Australian school of
writers are still listed in the membership-
roll, but fewer still play any decisive part
in shaping of Fellowship policy, which
coincides with the policies of various
other bodies that have been captured or
organised by the Comrades, and who toe
the party-line.
The Fellowship was captured by a
small but vocal group who entered its
ranks when it absorbed the pinkish
Writers’ Association. Since then it has
departed so far from its original objec-
tives that it can no longer be called a
Fellowship of Australian Writers. It is
provided with free publicity in the
columns of the “Tribune” —a favor not
granted to democratically Australian
organisations—and whenever there is a
Communist-organised demonstration on
the “cultural” front the voice of the
Fellowship delegate can be heard above
me rest.
All this has caused a wholesale
desertion from its ranks by writers of
standing, a few well-known Left-wing
Propagandists; being notable exceptions.
Australian authors badly need an alert
organisation to watch their interests and
advance their welfare, and since those
tunctions are no longer the main concern
or the Fellowship it behoves them to set
U P a new body based on the aims and
objectives of the original outfit. They
could, of course, if they desired, grab
i vf ms back f rom the Comrades — it
would not take a great deal of organisa-
-IQn, since the present crowd in control
are a muddle-headed mob—but the old
days 6 * S not WOrtb a B ra in salt these
What is wanted is a new body with a
ocw name, and a credentials committee
th a keen nose for detecting writers
more interested in white-anting the Aus-
tralian way of life than in upholding
Aushahan principles.— Old Freelance


Have YOU
sufficient
LIFE ASSURANCE
No man should so overload himself with
assurance that the payment of premiums
may become an embarrassment during his
lifetime.
On the other hand, no man —at least no
man with a dependent family—can afford
to sit back complacently with too little life
assurance. Indeed, the amount of life
assurance that you should have is of
utmost importance. It is YOUR responsi-
bility to see that the total of your policies
will be sufficient to afford your family the
protection that they will need, should the
emergency arise.
Now is the time to make provision for the
future. Not necessarily protection against
the possibility of death only, but provision
for all manner of purposes; the home you
intend to build; education for your family;
financial independence in your old age.
You can provide for these things with Life
Assurance. . .Whole of Life Assurance
payable at death, and Endowment Assur-
ance payable at a determined date or at
previous death.
Examine your situation now, and decide
how much assurance of both forms you
should have!

of assisting you in your assurance prob-
lems. Our officers will explain the advan-
