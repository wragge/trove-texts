The writer makes no pre-
tence that the relations be-
tween Rasputin and the
Tsaritza were other than
disreputably intimate....
Russia was poised uncer-
tainly on the verge of tre-
mendous things, and the
women of the Court set
were hysterical and over-
wrought. . . . Few people re-
alise yet how utterly and
basely the Russian people
were sold to the enemy.

The Poet, the Muse and the Missus.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My love is like a dew-kissed rose.
Two petals form her dainty nose ;
Her lips are tiny half-op’d buds . . ..
(Ah, Muse!' a word to rhyme with “buds”!)
“'Ere, come an ’ peel these blank y spuds!”
Each wayward tress that blows astray
Is like a kiss that lost its way ;
Two limpid eyes ’neath dropping lids.. . .
(Come, bring a rhyme, O Muse, for “lids”!)
“Eh, can’t you 'ear them squallin’ kids?”
Beneath her garb of shimm’ring green
Two feet that would they were unseen;
Two leaves a-curl to serve as b00t5....
(Do help me, Muse, to rhyme with “boots”!)
“Of all th ’ silly blinkin’ coots!”
A perfume rich, exotic, rare
Comes wafting by upon the air.
’Tis thus her soul to me is sped....
(Forsake me not, O Muse, with “sped” !)
“For Gawd’s sake, come an’ get ter bed!”
N.S.W.
LIONEL C. H. SHAVE.
The Poet
To begin at the beginning. At an early
stage the embryo is hermaphroditic. In
higher organisms one sex suppresses the
other. But the suppression is partial, so
that in varied degree we are all bisexual.
It results that some men are very feminine,
and some women masculine, physically, men-
tally, or both. These biological facts help
to explain the bard; for the poet is a
woman-man, a lady in male pants never
quite able to realise why she has lost her
skirts.
Interview any -well-known bard, and you
will find him feminine in appearance, hands,
feet, voice, or temperament; he is ssf
absorbed and eager, with a feminine desire
for admiration. Far from hiding his vices,
he may, like Lord Byron, parade and make
copy of them. Other scribes are reticent of
their work; but without provocation or .re-
quest a Tennyson or Wordsworth will re-
cite his old screed to his guests, just as a
coquette parades her old costumes of con-
quest. As poetry expresses feeling, it is
unrelated to present thought-process. The
poet may be a fool; frequently he has no
morals; and, a slave to emotion, without
emotion he is dumb. Hence the attraction
of dissipation, and even crime, as a means
of rekindling slumbering fires. Using only
an elementary thought-process, the poet con-
ceives that what he feels is a deciding factor
in a proposition. Often others are in the
same case; but the lead of feeling is the
lead of habit, and all the errors go with
habit.
At its different stages of growth, the child’s
promptings indicate the order of human
evolution ; and at puberty he comes to the
tribal and poetic stage. Most of us then
read, or even try to write, verse, a kind of
literary measles that usually soon passes.
But there are a few with whom it does not
pass. They never grow up. They are the
poets. In degree, nations have to pass
through the same evolutionary stages; and
in puberty, like Canada, the U.S.A., or Aus-
tralia, they show a liking for verse that a
mature nation would despise. Probably
living Australian poets have larger sales
and financial returns than the living bards
of France and England combined.
When books were- rare, and literature
aural, it was easier to memorise in verse.
Hence the ballad, romance, and epic. Often
the pleasure in sound was apart from the
sense, as in many songs. Besides its re-
cording value, verse early became an emo-
tional appeal to the primitive passions, sex-
love, maternity, patriotism and friendship;
and, by the Butler law of habit, the more
frequently in our past we have experienced
an emotion, the more a reminder of it will
impress us. This truth is the stock-in-trade
of the poet; purely instinctive, he revives
and rehearses emotional impressions com-
mon to himself and others, being most suc-
cessful when he says what we have all felt.
The phonograph of the passions—that is
his limit; for no poet, as a poet, ever dis-
covered or ever said a new 7 thing. The
alleged inspiration is confined to subcon-
scious reminiscence ; while all real knowledge
and intelligent advance arises from con-
scious thought. Many children and women
have written excellent verse; but never ex-
cellent philosophy. And as a ballet girl
trades on the proportions of her limbs, so
the versifier trades on the proportions of
his subconsciousness. The poet is a soul in
tights.
BIOLOGIST.
Gilbert White II.
Bishops are supposed by some to be an
uninteresting race, but Gilbert White, who
was an Anglican priest for 15 years in the
diocese of Carpentaria, and then bished
there for a similar period, after which he
went to bish for Willochra, in South Aus-
tralia, is something of an exception. His
Thirty Years in Tropical Australia is the
work "of an upstanding, sunburnt, muscular
man whose picture in the illustrated gar-
ments of office and humping the collapsible
pastoral crook seems rather an anomaly. He
was also a frost-bitten man, for he found the
ice very thick in some of his wanderings on
the tablelands up towards the Gulf.
The diocese where he spent his 30 tropical
years is commodious and well-ventilated. The
occupant starts his ministrations on the east
coast of North Queensland, and goes west
till he meets another bishop or gets his feet
wet in the Indian Ocean. From the cen-
tral point of Darwin he goes south till he
reaches the middle of Australia, and after
that he keeps going sonth till someone tells
him to stop or till he brings up against a
boundary sign which sets forth that prelates
will be prosecuted. A* man with a turn for
adventure must find it a great thing to be a
commodious prelate, quite unlike, say, his
Gaiters of Stepney, in London, who sounds
like a rather stuffy cleric. Dr. White sowed
the seed personally and by hand —not by
curate —from end to end of the Territory,
on hot ground and dry ground and high
ground and fly-infested ground, also up and
down rivers, and among all manner of islands
and shoals and crab-holes. He camped out
over most of his bishopric, a thing which
his reverend brother of Stepney never did in
his life, fearing to be arrested for vagrancy.
In pursuit of his flock, which was small,
and of many colors and degrees of breech-
clout, and often nearly a week’s journey
apart, he met insects long, and croco-
diles and pearl-shell and luminous fish and
one or two unexpected dead men and other
non-contributing parishioners. Apparently
there is a streak of the poet and still more of
the artist about the reverend gentleman, and
he enthuses much more naturally about the
painted color-schemes of Central Australia
than about all the tea-meetings of the wilder-
ness.
The precise value of a bishop is a matter
of opinion, and bishops themselves aren’t
unanimous on the subject, but the general
feeling that this one excites is friendly. His
views on the development of the North are
not all that this Page would like them to be;
nevertheless with all allowances and deduc-
tions Gilbert White’s book is recommended
as good Australian literature.

Bodies Soled and Heeled
Civilisation has not got far enough yet
to veto wars ; but it has come very near the
point of insisting that ('1) the dependents of
soldiers who are killed shall be maintained
at the public expense, and (2) if a sol-
dier is maimed his loss of earning power
shall be made good, also at the public ex-
pense. Some countries have, of course, gone
much farther towards admitting these prin-
ciples than others. And those which pay
their fighting men least are not, rather curi-
ously, the most backward in admitting their
liability to the wounded soldier. France
still pays its wonderfully patient poilu a
mere twopence or so per day. But its
blinded soldier, for example, gets a pension of
975 francs, together with an extra 100
francs for the Military ‘Medal (which all its
blinded soldiers get) ; and he will almost
certainly draw another 225 francs under the
pension law of 1831. This will give him
3.55 francs per day, equal to about 2s. Id.,
which it is reckoned will, with what he
should be able to earn, make his income
equal to the wage of a man who can use
his eyes.
A fraction over half a crown per day isn’t
very much to offer a man, certainly, for the
loss of his eyes. No money payment could
compensate him. But France argues that,
just as it was the man’s duty to the nation
to fight for iF—that is to say, for himself
and his family—so it is his duty to the
nation to continue a worker to the full ex-
tent of his diminished power.
Britain has done an enormous amount of
work in what has come to be called the re-
education of the maimed, and, in addition
to many books on various branches of the
subject, there is a monthly magazine,
Recalled to Life, devoted mainly to this
comparatively new science of orthopaedics.
But France has done more still; and what
is described as “the most complete French
work” on the subject has been put into Eng-
lish by Dr. Castle, R.N. (Physical and
Occupational Re-Education of the Maimed;
published by Baillibre, Tindall . and Cox,
London). While the special value of the book
lies in its descriptions of appliances for the use
of the maimed, some of the general con-
clusions arrived at with regard to the treat-
ment of the maimed and the selection of
occupations are of great value. On the
former point Dr. Jean Camus, the principal
contributor, has very definite opinions
Many are the cases with a result more favorable
than could have been hoped for, judging from the
destruction of tissue, which are solely due to the
perseverance and faith of the patient. I have seen
limbs, shattered beyond belief, regain nearly normal
function through the faith of the patient. This per-
sonal factor is worth more than electricity, heat or
vibrations, as, being constantly present, it urges the
patient on to overcome his disability. . . .This should
be well to the fore in every conversation between the
doctor and his patient.
Other doctors of great, experience in this
branch of their trade support this view.
Over 60 p.c. of the French maimed came
from the land; and the majority of the
authorities who contribute to this book
seem to regard it as specially fortunate that,
as Dr. Boureau puts it, “work on the land
offers the wounded the best chance of lead-
ing a happy and easy life.” Others go this
far—that “a man with an artificial arm
can do better work on the land than any-
where else, as in agriculture all movements
are much less complicated than in most
other callings.” But, while it is insisted
that any artificial hand (or arm) must be
regarded only as an auxiliary (and these
doctors insist that it is really of no perma-
nent consequence whether it is the right or
the left arm that is gone, for one can in a
few weeks be made to do as much as the
other), it is agreed that a single elaborate
arm and hand is of very little use. Almost
every kind of work requires a different
“hand” ; it has been found that five are
wanted for farm work, though some doctors
are managing with less. These “hands” are
really tool-holders. The “universal hand”
is regarded as something mainly for Sunday
wear.
Everywhere there is insistence on one
point at least: if it is at all possible, get
the man back to the job that he knew,
unless it was absolutely uncongenial to him, or
re-educate him for some job where his know-
ledge serves him. “For this reason,” says
Dr. Camus, “we try to turn a former car-
penter into a cabinet-maker, a slater into a
tinsmith or plumber, a blacksmith into a
mechanic, a house-painter into a carriage-
vamistier, and so on”—assuming, of course,
that his injuries prevent him from following
his old trade.

Like and Unlike.
Seaward sailing and homeward bound,
Swift as the shadows fall,
A ship goes out, and a ship comes iu—
And that’s the way with us all.
The harbor’s safe, the sea is kind,
Its breast is flecked with fleece;
But where’s the Harbor of the Heart
Where one may ride at peace?
Swinging, swaying by noon and night,
Ever and ever a-quest,
The tide comes in, and the tide goes out,
Like one who hungers for rest.
The caves and beaches bless the tides
As, charged with life, they come ;
But there are men who never know
A hearth-fire and a home.
Sighing, shouting and never still,
Deaf to each other’s call,
The wind goes out, and the wave.comes in—
And that’s the way with us all.
The tide and wind, and ship and wave
To all who hearken preach,
And of their preaching comes this truth—
Life’s like, and unlike, each.

RODERIC QUINN.
Respite.
Take my heart wandering, summer cloud,
to-day,
Up to the piney crests by granite tors,
And let it rest a moment on a bough.
The rocking bird’s-nest never will deny
My heart this minute’s peace; the resined
bough
Will swing for it a special lullaby.
For I have friends among the leaves and
flowers
That never question—only take me home!
Take my heart wandering, summer cloud,
to-day.
I am so very tired of all the fret
Of petty thoughts and still more petty words,
Of wagging tongues, and misconceptions;
till
The only pleasant things seem far-off hills
And the sweet healing of the piney winds,
And ringed lagoons where water-lilies float
And black duck light among the rustling
reeds,
And, stealing from the scrub, the kangaroo
Comes with the moon, to wet his thirsty
mouth,
Then rears his deer-like head and thuds
away
As though some unknown terror dogged his
heels. . . .
Perhaps he heard my heart among the
boughs!
Take my heart wandering, summer cloud,
to-day;
For I may find pale dawn among the trees
With dewdrops in the wonder of her hair,
Or some mauve scarf that evening left
behind
When she fled naked to the arms of Night.
These things can hind new wounds and salve
old scars,
And send the heart back to the coward
breast
Brave for the endless rasp of every-day !
Take my heart wandering, summer cloud,
to-day.
But do not let your cool arms bear it south,
For should it find the heights of Hawkes-
bury,
The ferny ridges and the pixy trails.
The clear, still waters that reflect the hills,
And George’s River where the wild- flowers
are,
And should it cross the long white bridge at
Ryde
And, following the outskirts, sense the town
That lies beside the harbor and the sea.
No jutting cliff could stay its swallow flight.
No south wind blow it inland any more,
Because there is a little hidden bay
With one fair beach that holds a memory
star;
And if you carried my heart close to these
Then I must die —or go and follow it —
And it would leave that haven never more!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
The Vampire.
And here, although the sun shines bright
aboee.
There is no radiance on the sullen ground
Where strange weeds sprawl among the lep-
rous stones,
And no leaf stirs or sighs, though all
around
Tile wind roars iu the branches. White as
bones
The stark limbs flicker in the shady grove.
Faint in the shade those pallid boles shine
round
An inky pool fed by a sluggish spring.
With never foam or flash of bubble bright.
But steathily and silent as some Thing
Creeps through an evil dream, deep in the
night.
Upon the victim shackled to the ground.
Now to my shrinking senses comes the thrill.
Subtle and burning on the face and throat,
Of hidden eyes close watching from the brake.
Strange unseen lips that flutter, cling and
gloat
With feathery moistuess to the wrist, and
make
The quick pulse falter with their deadly chill.
Soon shall she hold me whom my soul doth
keep !
And yet I.love her for her fierce glad eyes;
So I shall lie and, dreaming, watch the red
Grow in her cheeks, as quivering she lies,
Lips to my breast, till over me is spread
W ave upon drowsy wave of boundless sleep.

WATT’S NEW CONSTITUTION.
Acting Prime Minister Watt has made it
known that one of the jobs ahead is the
rebuilding of the Australian Constitution.
It was always insufficient and a makeshift,
and with the progress of events it is more
inefficient than it used to be. There are two
matters on which the powers of the Com-
monwealth require almost indefinite expan-
sion. Finance, of course, is one. Events
have travelled a long way since the
Constitution was devised. One at least
of the States is floundering. Westralia,
by reason of its neglect of manufac-
tures and its insane reliance on raw
products,, or rather on one raw product,
begins to look like a worn-out pearl-shell
patch to which the pearlers are still tied
because they have borrowed so much money
on the security of the patch. If any State
could go bankrupt on its own there would
be little harm done, but it can’t break
without great risk of blowing down the
whole system of loan finance, which is crazy
and not to be breathed on with impunity.
Even prompt repair after the collapse is
insufficient; there must be no collapse to
draw attention to the shakiness of things in
general. And Westralia isn’t the only State
which is on the edge of trouble. It isn’t
enough in such a case for the Commonwealth
to take over the State debts. It has power
to do that already; but the power was never
executed, because Party Government is
always tired, and also because there is an
element of absurdity about taking over old
debts while new ones are being contracted
daily. The problem is one of taking over
the debts and the borrowing powers, and
with them the railways, which represent
the bulk of the debt. And there is
not much time to be lost about doing it.
Then the Australian Parliament requires
vastly greater powers for the preservation
of peace, for things have changed so much
even in the past half-dozen years that gory
revolution is being preached and organised
quite openly.. There being no privileged class
to rise against in this land, where every
man and woman has an equal share of politi-
cal power and where the majority rules, a
small roaring minority has announced its
intention of usurping the control of affairs,
and establishing itself as a privileged
oligarchy, and taking by violence the
majority's goods, and possibly, on the Bol-
shevik plan, its daughter, if she is attractive
enough. (The majority can take anybody's
goods and daughter by lawful means, but a
small minority has to use violence.; The
proposition is that the trades unions, repre-
senting about one-sixth of the pop.uation of
working age, can by their control of the
mines, railways and shipping impose their
will by force on the whole population. It
will be something like the French nob lity
which, though a small crowd and not wildly
intelligent, yet by its organisation ruled
France for centuries. The officialdom or
Council of Ten of the One Big Union is to
be able by touching the button to enforce its
demands, whatever they may be, its method
being the simple one of the interdict, excom-
munication, boycott or suspension of oper-
ations. Nominally the Council is to be ruled
by the vote of the members of the Big Union,
but members count for so little that it has
been decided not even to hold a formal
ballot, as originally proposed, of unionists
to decide whether their bodies shall join the
Big concern or not. The organisers are con-
fident that they have so far got control of
the machinery and have established such a
habit of subservience that the regular forms
can be dispensed with. As Garden, secre-
tary of Sydney Trades Council, explained
in the Sydney press on January 22, meet-
ings of unionists are to be held, not with
their elected officials at the usual halls, but
under Big Union propagandists at places
like Mort’s Dock and Garden Island during
working hours. Then the strenuous or Bol-
shevik elements are to be organised into
insurrectionary committees, which are to drive
the less Bolshevik elements before them.
“We will go on the job,” says the secretary,
“and force them to compel their officials.”
etc., etc. The men who speak so confidently
about forcing allegedly free and self-govern-
ing unionists to do their bidding seem quite
capable of organising their One Big Com-
bination and driving it with whips of scor-
pions when it is organised.

The great combine proposes not only to
include railwaymen and miners and seamen
and all the usual workers. It also expects
to enrol the police so that its council can
give them orders over-riding the Govern-
ment in times of annoyance. Further, it
aims at control of the fire brigades, so that
when next the I.W.W. party sets a city on
fire it may, if it pleases, order that the city
shall just be allowed to burn. The invari-
able proposal to take over the means of pro-
duction is, of course, included, and when
they are taken over no one outside the Big
institutions’s limits can work except by its
permission and on its terms. In secretaiy
Garden’s statement it is announced that
the Russian Soviet system is the model and
that a school of Bolshevists like that of
bloodstained Moscow is aimed at.
* * * *
Considering these and a number of other
avowed circumstances Mr. Watt’s proposal
for an amended Federal Constitution seems
neither too violent nor too hurried. The
present position is full of weak point. There
are six different police forces under six differ-
ent controls. The first Bolshevik Govern-
ment which gets possession of a State like
Queensland can turn a well-selected bobby
force into an army. It is an obvious pro-
position that a police force is bigger than
an army if there is enough of it, and the
quantity of it is decided by an authority
which Watt .doesn’t control. Also it is
better armed than an army if supplied with
the needful weapons. The railways are
under State control except in certain cir-
cumstances. and it will probably be too late
to do much by the time these circumstances
arise. A Soviet at Newcastle —and secretary
Garden states most distinctly in the press
that Soviets on the model of the Hamburg
Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Council and the institu-
tions of Russia are intended —could cut off
two-thirds of the coal supply of Australia
in a way that it would take a couple o£
years to repair. And while the separate
State loan policies last it would be a
poor sort of Bolshevik viovernment which
didn’t have the proceeds of a hefty loan in
its Treasury before the row started and be-
fore the repudiation. In fact, the Constitu-
tion was always too weak even in peace
time, and for use in a time of civil commo-
tion it is hopeless. It hasn’t provided an
Australian capital as a home and rallying
point of the Australian Government and
forces; the Government is a boarder or
hash-house inmate of one of the States. It
didn’t create or enforce a uniform railway
gauge, and for lack of the means of swift
travel 10,000 troops would do less than the
work of 1000. It did hardly anything in the
way of strategic railways. It has done
nothing to safeguard the scanty coal sup-
pi ies. Its shipping and arsenals are a joke.
Certainly it has kept up the supply of State
Governors, but the use of a State Governor
as a remedy for either bankruptcy or brigand-
age is problematical. As soon as Watt is
quite sure that Senator Pearce and his large
family are safely on their way to England
at the public exjpense he ought to consider
the Constitution seriously. Plain Unification
followed by complete Reconstruction is what
this country wants.
A ROTTEN OLD SYSTEM.
In the Army no one but a trained doctor
is allowed to attend to the men’s health;
which is as it should be. A qualified
religious expert attends to the souls of each
unit, and competition by spiritual quacks is
forbidden. The Dental Corps fixes up the
Army’s teeth. Any amateur or unauthorised
dentist who got to work on an expedition-
ary’s tooth, and was discovered by one in
authority, would strike serious trouble.
Even the animals are protected. An officer
or man might be an experienced horse-
master, yet if he operated on an ailing horse
or mule he would go for a Court-martial.
The veterinary officer is the only man who
is permitted to handle that sort of job.
ivA on thy sanitary officers must be experts.
Unskilled work, quackery, inexperience and
incompetence are discouraged in every direc-
tion —but one. Where it is a question
of a soldier’s liberty or reputation, any ass
may handle the scales. When a soldier of
the A.I.F. is tried the “members of the
Court” —that is to say, his Judges—may be,
and usually are, men who know nothing
about law, procedure, or the rules of evi-
dence, and often they take a fatuous pride
in it. Before seniority gave them the rank
that qualities for the bench of a field-general
or district court-martial, they were perhaps
Imperial N.C.O.’s, or farmers, or bar-
tenders, or lads from Duntroon. Proved
soldiers, but with all the traditional soldier’s
bluff affectation of contempt for the petti-
foggeries of the lawyer.

A section of the N. S. Wales public has
been raging for weeks past at Speaker
Coiien being put on the District Court
Bench, Cohen being at the worst ft bar-
rister and one who has for some years
successfully held a position analogous to
that of a Judge. Do the people who are
scandalised at the idea of Cohen ad-
ministering in a £4OO jurisdiction realise
that for upwards of four years their nearest
and dearest have been liable to be judged
by men by comparison with whom Cohen
is a Blackstone or a Coke? Probably
not, nor yet that the technical job of pro-
secuting accused soldiers has been handled
during that time by such persons as ex-
grocers, -gardeners, or -graziers, while the
difficult business of defending has been allot-
ted often to ex-haberdashers or -horse-
copers, or others of no legal experience
whatever. The inevitable outcome of this
insane system has been a nightmare reign
of injustice in which innocent men have
suffered and guilty ones have escaped in
about equal proportions. The following are
a few out of scores of administration and
judicial idiocies encountered by one Aus-
tralian officer during three years in Egypt.
England and France: —
R. was committed in England for a D.G.M. for
being A.W.L. for 26 days. He v’as at a Details
Camp and the C.O. of the brigade (an ex-N.C.O. in
the English Army of the ’Bo’s) disapproved of part
of the Summary of Evidence. The document came
back to the prisoner’s O.C. for alteration. It
continued to pass to and fro between Brigade and
Details for 11 weeks. Becoming weary, R.C. got
through the window of the “clink”—a place described
later as one in which “only an honest man would
remain.” The sergeant and corporal of the guard
were tried, convicted and sentenced for letting him
escape. Recaptured he spent a further eight weeks
in confinement —and then departed again. He put
in 192 days in all in gaol awaiting his trial. A
reversion, this, to the custom of the pre-Magna
Charta period that must constantly occur in camps
presided over by men whose whole legal equipment
is a smattering of the Manual of Military Law.
J.F. was tried by D.C.M. for “stealing goods the
property of a comrade.” He had unquestionably
stolen the goods. His C.O. and the latter’s
adjutant, who were responsible for the framing of
the charge, decided on the more serious one, instead
of on a charge of simple larceny, so that J.F. might
be more severely punished. The sole proof of
“ownership” which they produced was the evidence
of the Q.M.-Sergeant, who testified that the alleged
owner of the goods had “told him (the Q.M.) that
they were his.” J.F. happened to be defended by
a lawyer, who at once took the point that the
Q.M.’s evidence was hearsay, and hence worthless.
J.F. thus escaped altogether. He merited punish-
ment, and would have got it if his superiors had
possessed an elementary knowledge of the laws of
evidence.
F.L. was lined up for refusing to be inoculated,
lie was one of those 1914 men who had never signed
an undertaking to be inoculated, and he had scruples
on the point. The expert advisers of the British
Army have all along recognised that a soldier can-
not be compelled to undergo inoculation. It is in
the same category as an operation. F.L.’s C.O.
knew nothing of this, and neither did the Court
which tried him. F.L. was convicted and sentenced.
The sentence was never promulgated, as steps were
taken to bring the case before H.Q. authorities,
who ordered his release.
S. was on trial for A.W.L. The case for the
prosecution was closed. He opened up a strong
defence. Half-way through it the President of the
Court ordered the prosecutor to re-open his ease
and find witnesses to rebut the statements of
the accused’s witnesses. After several hours’ delay
they were found. The accused had advanced nothing
that put a new aspect on the proceedings. He had
simply given the Court an uneasy feeling that the
original case against him required strengthening—
and it was done in defiance of all law and equity.
One of these later witnesses proved a dud. He was
immediately cross-examined by the prosecutor as to
his morals, habits and record, and when the Prosecu-
tor had finished the President took a turn. It was
good comedy, but as regards Justice it was a
tragedy.
* * * *
The convention that soldier-offenders
should be tried by their officers comes from
England. It worked moderately well there
till the beginning of the Great War. The
officers in the original British expeditionary
force were as carefully trained, in many
cases, in purely military late, as they were
in military work in the field. In all offences
other than military ones—in all offences,
that is, which coulcl possibly be handled by
the civilian courts—the old Army stood
aside, that being the law of the land. In
the A.I.F. we have, and always have had,
the wicked system of soldiers, not only in
France and Palestine, where no civilian
courts were available, but in England and
even in Australia, being tried and sentenced
for every sort of offence by men who as
lawyers are a public laughing-stock. Their
inefficiency and the tragic effects of it have
been officially recognised in the last two
years to an extent. There has been added
to every court-martial a so-called legal
expert, or Legal Member. The Legal Mem-
bers in the Australian sector in France were
very young, and they did not claim to be
profound or experienced lawyers. But at
least they were lawyers. Their job was
the preposterous one of bear-leading the
bench —of, as far as possible, preventing
the president and other senior members of
the Court from making fools of themselves.
* ' * * * *
If, in the Army, a man’s reputation were
half as tenderly guarded as his health or
his teeth,* or the health or teeth of the
animal he rides, the opportunity would bo
given to every soldier to be prosecuted, de-
fended, tried and judged by experts. There
is not one valid argument or the shadow
of one against the contention that every
soldier should have that right. Just as
great doctors are taken from civilian life
and attached to the Army with the rank and
pay of generals and colonels, so great bar-
risters should all along have been incor-
porated in it on a similar basis. The exer-
cise of the censorship has stifled public dis-
cussion of such matters during the past four
years. But it has not stopped private com-
ment. It is safe to say that 20 per cent,
of the votes registered against conscription
by the Diggers were the outcome of
true stories concerning the fantastic in-
justices that a man was liable to incur by
enlisting in the Army. Not many soldiers fear
death greatly, but every decent citizen has
a dread of the prison stigma. Under a
system of criminal trials without juries, and
by men who not only lack the judicial
attitude of mind, but also have practically no
knowledge of the laws they are there to
administer, the possibility of the prison
stigma hangs over every soldier in the A.I.F.
SUFFOCATED ENGLAND AND
OTHER MUTTERS.
The meeting of Premiers and a half-Prime
Minister, held in Melbourne to swap re-
criminations and promissory notes, had its
usefulness cut short when Premier Holman
fled home without notice, by special train,
to escape the plague. In the absence of
the principal borrower, there was nothing
much to be done. Less excitable men stayed
to see the business out; but it would
have 'made little difference if all the dele-
gates had departed simultaneously by
special train except the Tasmanian one, who
would, of course, have left by ironclad.
The Federal Treasurer naturally gave
notice that the subsidy to the State Govern-
ment of 255. per inhabitant per annum
can’t be maintained. It is to diminish by
instalments till it gets down to 10s. per
head in 1926. After that, unless things
improve, it will doubtless diminish by fur-
ther instalments. The representatives of
the States that are barely able or not able
to make ends meet with the 255. subsidy
and, in two cases, with temporai'y special
allowances as well, ' didn’t profess to have
any idea how they would do any better when
affairs thus became a great deal worse. No-
body proposed a way of meeting the diffi-
culty, such as by abolishing Isuperfluous
Governors" Upper Houses, Agents-Generals,
travelling Ministers, idleness or the like.
The proposal to economise by amalgamating
the State savings bank with the Federal
concern was unanimously turned down,
though MacPiiekson, of Victoria, admitted
that his little State is losing £20,000 a year
by the present duplication. Everybody, but
espepially Tiieodoke, of Queensland, admit-
ted that the State savings banks exist
largely in order that the State Governments
may borrow the deposits, and there is a
fear that if the whole business becomes a
Federal concern the Commonwealth may
borrow all the deposits. It is an obvious
fact that if any State left off borrowing and
paid for its public works out of taxes it
would have first call on as much as it
wanted of the deposits, both State and
Federal, within its territory. It would get
them before the money became deposits.
But that view of the case wasn’t mentioned.
One notable proposal re the swapping of the
1.0. U. was that the Commonwealth should
borrow £100,000,000 or so to find land and
public works jobs for returned soldiers, and
advance this money to the States at 1 per
cent, less interest than it cost. Thus the
people in their State capacity would pay
1 per cent, less and the same people would
pay the 1 per cent, in their Federal capacity,
and would lose at one end what they saved
at the other. This 1 per cent, discount
was a matter about which the conference was
fairly unanimous. And no one hired a
special train to flee from the proposal that
the war debts of the Empire, and if possible
the peace debts also, should be put into one
big pool under one control. This would
mean a great saving to Australia in cost
of management, provided the management
was better than Australia’s, and as it would
of necessity be mostly British, the better
management seemed to be taken for granted.
Also it would mean to some extent a pool-
ing of credit, so that the Government which
people trusted would be a little worse off
and the one it had doubts about a trifle
better off. It appeared to be assumed that
Australia’s credit is so bad now, or is likely
to be so much worse through future wild-
cat finance, that it couldn’t avoid being a
gainer by the bargain. Treasurer Watt
stated that Britain would also be a gainer
by the combine, which is possibly true in
an indirect fashion. If the finance of one
or more Australian States collapsed utterly
the place at the other end of the Empire
would be a heavy loser. The loss might be
averted if an Imperial Commission got a
hold on Australian finance, for the hold
might grow till the Commission was able to
do things that would stagger the present
generation of Treasurers.
Much lamentation took place, as a matter
of course, to the effect that the things the
other fellow was doing—the Federal fellow
or the State fellow according to which fel-
low was lamenting at the moment —would
lead to more taxes. But hardly anything
took place about the fact that Australia’s
overwhelming need is not more taxes on the
people we have but more people to carry the
taxes we have. A real civilisation can’t be
maintained on a solvent basis with a popula-
tion of five persons to three square, miles.
Five persons aren’t sufficient to pay for
civilising three square miles, and unless
there is to be a great breakage extra popula-
tion must be found or the present popula-
.tion must be content to live in a more simple
or aboriginal or Patagonian fashion. In fact,
the breakage is liable to make things very
aboriginal whether the people are content
or not. Unfortunately the struggle just


now is not to' acquire new prosperous wage-
earning inhabitants who will contribute an
average £6 17s. Od. a year each in taxes,
and. pay about £4 a year each into the
railway and tramway revenue, and save the
country about £ls a year each in outlay for
imported goods by making these goods them-
selves, and incidentally create by their
mere presence a heap of new land values.
Rather there is an effort to buy back a cer-
tain amount of old population at £625 each
—that is one estimate, but it is probably a
very insufficient one —with a number of mis-
cellaneous aids and tax exemptions thrown
in. and settle these folk in low-wage indus-
tries which haven’t been feeling well for a
long while, and which do a special and con-
spicuous perish every time the frequent
draught comes along. Another large num-
ber are to be supported by building loan
railways to connect with the loan settlers,
and they are not expected to be a revenue-
producing crowd either. In Australia the
comparatively poor man pays very little in
taxes, and the comparatively poor and non-
smoking teetotaller pays practically nothing.
The man who rises above the ruck supplies
the public income, and the railway-builder
seldom rises. He isn’t expected to get into
the tax-paying class* after any appreciable
fashion, any more than the £625 loan settler.
By being a fruitful excuse for loans it is
merely their business to necessitate taxes.
* * * *
Still it is the policy of our legislators to
create the largest posible non-taxable popu-
lation even if they have to borrow much
money to do it. So the conference which
met to swap recriminations and promissory
notes dispersed, partly by high-priced special
train, without anything more definite than
a remark by Watt that “State Govern-
ments should keep vividly before them the
idea portrayed by Senator Millen of the
encouragement of newer and smaller indus-
tries by the States.” Considering that it
was Freetrader Millen who regarded new
industries as superfluous, this dragging in of
his name sounded like irony. There was also
irony in Watt’s proposition that Britain
would really benefit by pooling its debts and
its credit with those of Australia. The
benefit that Britain is looking for is of a
different kind. In England at all events
almost the worst of many problems is that
of housing. Jesse Collings, who nearly
passed as a statesman a few years ago, cre-
ated a furore with his doctrine that every
Englishman should possess “three acres and
a cow.” The insuperable difficulty is that
in England there is one person to every acre
—in other words the whole country is more
densely peopled th«n Ryde or Hurstville
Cbydney) and half as densely peopled as the
undesirable suburb of Botany (Sydney).
After allowing some space for agriculture,
dairying, mining, factories, shipyards, moun
tarns, lakes, rivers and other bulky industries
proper housing is simply impossible. Eng-
land doesn’t want Australia to make it a
present of any part of its debt. It wants
this country to make a present of a lot of
space- to take some millions of population
even if it takes their industries along with
them. The people want to come here for
breathing room and Watt and Millen
miike it impossible for them to come by
refusing to provide reliable skilled employ-
ment. If England, one of these days, goes
mad and runs amok it will probably be
through suffocation, for which Watt and
Millen will be largely responsible.
THE DIGGER WITH THE COUGH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Already in Australia there are some hun-
dreds of returned soldiers suffering from
tuberculosis of the lungs (usually known
as consumption). They are being given
some more or less efficient sanatorium treat-
ment. but beyond this nothing is being done
to ensure that those who leave the sanatoria
in a convalescent condition are adequately
supervised to ensure complete recovery, or
to provide employment for the sufferers
under suitable conditions. For years we
have been told that nothing is too good for
those afflicted as the result of fighting the
nation’s cause. Special provision is made
for the blind and the maimed, and much
is done for others ; yet, for the consumptive,
whose case is in many ways the most piti-
able of all, and who far outnumbers the
blind, no scheme of betterment exists.
At present there is no cure for consump-
tion. If a patient is taken early and given
a course of fresh air, good food, and rest,
with graduated exercise, he may throw off
the disease in six months; but very few do
this. A certain percentage will die in a
few months, no matter what treatment is
given; for many, the arrest of the disease
is a matter of years; in others the disease
assumes a light chronic form in which the
patient may live to be fifty or sixty, and
be capable of light work the whole time.
To provide the fresh air treatment State
authorities have erected sanatoria; but
these are largely failures for the reason that
they are regarded by the public as places to
be avoided at all costs, and, because no
proper post-sanatorium treatment or em-
ployment is provided, the so-called sana-
toria are becoming filled with impecunious
chronics, who have nowhere else to go.
Thus the sanatorium, instead of being the
place of health, becomes a home for in-
curables.
Other reasons of the failure of sanatoria
are that patients do not enter them early
enough. Many doctors do not seem able to
diagnose the disease in its early phases.
Again, breadwinners, knowing that their
wages will cease on entering the sanatorium,
put off going there until too late to be cured.
However, it is when the consumptive
leaves the sanatorium that his greatest diffi-
culties begin. Very few can follow their
previous occupations without suffering a
relapse; yet what else is a bread-winner
to do? And he must work full time at that,
because the present industrial system does
not admit of part-time work. Those who are
not breadwinners may have a home to go
to in a healthy district, but most have not,
and for these again there is no provision
made. Many nurses are quite willing to
open convalescent homes in hill districts;
but fhey cannot, because they have to be
licensed by local authority, which, as soon
as tuberculosis is mentioned, refuses the
license. The consumptives, notwithstanding,
flock to the health resorts just the same;
but, instead of being properly looked after
by trained nurses in convalescent homes,
where all risk of infection would be an-
nihilated, they stay at hotels and boarding
houses, camouflage their ailments under the
names of catarrh, bronchitis, etc., take no
precautions against infecting others, and
thus become centres for the dissemination of
the disease.
The infectiousness of the consumptive lias
been exaggerated by over-zealous medical
men and public health authorities until the
sufferer has become a pariah and his life
made unbearable, yet the only source of
infection is the patient’s sputum, and if
this is caught in a proper receptacle and
destroyed each day, and the articles that,
come in contact with the patient’s mouth
boiled, all risk of infection ceases. This
could be done daily in any hotel, boarding-
house, or restaurant at very little expense,
and the consumptive live quite safely with
his fellow; but, at present, panic fear of
the disease, which has been instilled into
the public, defeats its own end and nothing
is done. Consumptives must travel, eat and
sleep like other people; but supposing a
tubercular subject in a train takes out a
sputum flask to use, the other passengers
would probably leave the car or ask to have
the sufferer removed, which, under the rail-
way by-laws, could be done. If, on the
other hand, the consumptive spits out of the
window or into his handkerchief, or even on
to the floor, no action would follow. In
fpet, in Victoria, the Commissioners thought-
fully provide brass-lined depression in
smoking carriage floors where the expec-
toration may dry and give off its bacilli to
the world. The writer, a consumptive of
some years, when travelling, carries a
water-proof match box in which to spit, and
is generally able to use it without attract-
ing notice; yet the other day, in a public
health office, when this was produced, the
public health officer said: “Why don’t you
carry a proper flask?” This inability in
the official mind to look at things from the
patient’s point of view has much to do with
the failure to get better results in the fight
against the disease. Again, if a consump-
tive in a restaurant asked to have his
utensils sterilised after him he would prob-
ably be asked to leave. The same with his
glasses in a bar or books in a library. It
should be made law that a consumptive, on
entering an hotel or restaurant, must dis-
close his ailment to the attendant, who must
ss,e that the articles used are sterilised,
either party being subject to a heavy fine
for infraction. The same principle could
be applied to boarding houses, passenger
ships, sleeping cars and libraries. The
present system amounts to this: Whilst a
patient is in a sanatorium every precaution
is taken against infection, almost to a point
of absurdity, but, outside an institution, the
measures he may take are left entirely to
himself. No encouragement at all is given
him to take any measure. In fact, it is made
much easier and comfortable for him in
every way to take no precautions at all.
Further, we need an adequate tuberculosis
settlement or colony in each State. The
settlement area should include a large quan-
tity of land suitable for the lighter kinds
of farming, and the consumptives who came
from unhealthy occupations should be em-
ployed there. Open-air workshops should
be erected for artisans, whose trades are not
unhealthy, and they should work such hours
and at such tasks as suited their strength.
Other progressing patients could follow their
usual occupations in the administrative,
postal, electrical, transport and other inci-
dental and necessary services, all the build-
ings being designed on hygienic principles.
Above all, married cases would be, as far
as possible, in their own homes, also speci-
ally designed. As pointed out above the
infection of a convalescent or light case is
easily neutralised, with ordinary care and
cleanliness, and there is no need for the
separation of a convalescent patient from
his or her family, if the sufferer keeps up
the treatment under hygienic conditions.
With regard to children born or unborn, the
whole matter would be far better arranged
in a colony then when left to the unfettered
inclinations of the ex-sanatorium patient, as at
present. The children already here would
have healthy homes, good food, and open-air
schools, while on the question of the birth
of more children medical officer’s advice
would always be available. With such a
colony consumptives could be compelled to
become members of it, until cured; and
with all classes joining the settlement, it
would probably develop most of the attrac-
tions qf the ordinary country town. The
consumptive would find life ' worth living,
and have some inducement to progress.
Such a settlement would probably be
almost self-supporting after the initial out-
lay, and if Australia raised another war
loan, and spent it on fighting tuberculosis in
this _ waj, our country would have
the disease well in hand in five years, and
quite stamped out in a generation. With
our soldiers, the pension scheme somewhat
mitigates their lot, but is no substitute for
some scheme for providing light work, nor
does it do anything to prevent the tuber-
cular discharged soldier being a menace to
his fellow-citizens.
For the civil population, the need for
prompt and comprehensive action towards the
prevention of consumption is extreme, and
every day’s delay means more expense in the
long run. But to our soldiers Australia lias
pledged her word to do- her best: and while
the only provision made for the tubercular
men is that at present existing, Australia is
not doing her best, or anything approaching
it. A mere hostel scheme is no use at all.
A tubercular settlement scheme should be
put in hand at once, in co-operation with the
State health authorities if they are willing.
It is no use waiting a year or two, for by
that time many of our A.I.F. consumptives
will be dead or have retrogressed and become
chronics.
PHTHISIS.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Our Country’s Troubles.
Now that Australia has time to sit down —
if it isn’t sitting down already or else lean-
ing up—and consider its war troubles, they
don’t look so very bad by comparison, and
everything is comparative in this compara-
tively small world. What badness there
is about them arises not so much from neces-
sity as from mental abstraction, profound
calm mitigated by superficial fuss, and a
sedentary but verbally-excited habit of mind
in high places, which high places are too
numerous. The United Kingdom in 1916
taxed its people, mostly for war purposes,
to the extent of £ll 3s. 6d. per inhabitant,
and levied enormous municipal taxation to
cover most of the police, education and
charitable expenditure in addition to the
things that are charged to local taxation in
Australia. This country raised £6 Bs. sd.
per head in State and Federal taxes, and
part of that went to pay for carrying goods
and passengers, on the Government railways
below cost, and doing other services at less
than cost, so that it got about Bs. per head
returned to it in rebates. Its Local Gov-
ernment taxation was very light. In 1917
the British people paid £ll 16s. Id. per head
in taxes, plus heavy Local Government
rates, while Australians paid £6 17s. sd.
plus very small local rates, and got nearly
10s. per head back in the form of services
done at less than cost. For 1918 the
British tax figures, judged by progress re-
ports, will prove a great deal more than even
the previous maximum of £ll 16s. Id. per
head. The difference lies in the fact that
Britain paid quite a large part of its war
charges out of revenue, while Australia paid
little or nothing beyond pensions and inter-
est on war loans. Yet the efforts which
Britain made were so stupendous that, de-
spite all the war charges, which it paid out
of revenue, its debt, with no State railways
to set against it, was more per head when
last inspected than Australia’s. And as
regards debt for which there are no produc-
tive assets of any kind to show, the burden
of the Cold Country may prove, when all
the accounts are made up, nearly twice as
heavy as ours in proportion to population.
Australia is in the remarkable position that
if it put up its State, Federal and Local
Government taxation to three-quarters of the
British figure, or rather less, it could run a
strenuous public works policy without any
more loans, and still* have something over for
old debts. As for the two repatriation ques-
tions they don’t even begin to compare.
Britain lias about 6,500,000 people,
combatants and non-combatants, to bring
home from the battle front. If Aus-
tralia was involved to the same extent
it -would have 700,000 people to bring
home and find work for instead of less than
half that number. Including munition
workers and others the worried people at
London have the job of getting some
10,000,000 folk back to peace avocations.
Australia’s figure is certainly less than
300,000 all told, but it would be 1.100,000
if it was built on the British scale. Yet
Britain’s problem is less than that which
faces France, Belgium and Serbia. But
for the insane low-tariff policy which
systematically prevents manufactures in
the importing interests, this country would
have no problem at all. There is work and
good wages and a reliable local market here
for far more than 300,000 new workers.
Nothing in the situation justifies despond-
ency. Nothing justifies wild theories to
the effect that only a Bolshevik uprising
and the commandeering of all industries and
the repudiation of all debts can save the
community. In fact, there is nothing wrong
at all barring the fact that this is a
3,000.000-square mile country run by men
with 640-acre minds.
A Row in the Ante-chamber of Death.
Victoria and N. S. Wales are still snarling
at one another over the influenza outbreak.
Victoria regards the distracted Mother State
as hypochondriacal. Melbourne Age argues
that there is nothing to worry about —
nothing more, anyhow, than there has been
any time the last three months. Sydney
Telegraph, speaking for the traditionally
ill-used portion of the Commonwealth, re-
marks that “the action of Victorian official-
dom all through has been analogous to
nothing so much as that, of the irresponsible
child playing with a venomous snake,” and
lets it go at that. Last week a number of
true pneumonic-influenza cases appeared in
Melbourne —undoubtedly a result of Vic-
toria’s refusal to make the disease notifiable
months ago. Inevitably the epidemic appeared
also in N. S. Wales. That State put itself in
quarantine. Victoria countered by doing
the same. Whereupon the N. S. Wales
authorities, in defiance of the Constitution,
took steps to bar Victorian travellers alto-
gether. There is still doubt as to the exact
nature of the trouble. The infeetivity may
be “explosive” and deadly; or it may be
slight and unenergetic. In any case there
is no doubt on one point—that the futile
and discreditable dog-fight which has arisen
demonstrates again how necessary it is that
the Commonwealth Government should have
complete control of the nation’s health.
There is- nothing parish-minded about dis-
ease. It is the great international. It can
only be effectively coped with by a central
administration acting with one end only in
view—the general good. Is notifiability a
prevention? If so there must be such a
unity of command as will make it compul-
sory in every State. Are masks, disinfect-
ants and inoculation advisable? If so
there should be an authority competent to
insist on their use everywhere. May it be
advisable, on occasion, to declare a State, or
part of a State, infected? If so the job
should be done by a body that is uninflu-
enced by the personal or business considera-
tions of the section affected. It all amounts,
of course, to an invasion of State Rights.
But what is the dreary old anachronism
worth, anyhow, when weighed against the
possible loss of thousands of good Australian
lives?
On Backing Ink with Knowledge.
It is pathetic to see the world’s thought con-
centrating in the old way on the notion that
a treaty is a sure thing. It was Oliver
Cromwell who asked, with a statesman’s
grip of realities : “Are we for all our blood
to have a little piece of paper?” A .League
of Nations is an idea to thrill the souls of
publicists and speculative philosophers; but
what notion will it convey to the rank and
tile of people who are never quite sure where
the mark ought to go on the ballot-paper i
A solid campaign of international education
must therefore be carried out exactly on the
lines-of the war progaganda which had so
much to do with the smashing of the German.
It is all very well for statesmen to arrange
the terms of peace, but Bill, Hans, Jean
and Ivan must be told separately and indi-
vidually exactly what those peace terms mean
and are worth to them. The spirit _ and
purpose of all treaties must be explained,
not in mere newspaper headlines, but from
lip to ear in the most remote corner of every
land. That is the only road of safety. The
pen has been proved mightier than the sword,
but not so much mightier tfcat it could claim
a walk-over when merely used to sign this
or that document in the name of a people
who had no idea what the signatures stood
for. But the pen wisely used to get the
truth right into the brain of the humblest
citizen, and backed by the useful tongue, can
be made much mightier than it has been. If
tie German had been told courteously, very
freouently and with 00-/iction all he had to
lose by going to war, it is an open question
whether Krupps might not now have been
ba-krunt through m-olongei peace. if the
game is to be better played in the future,
the world must know what it has to gain
by respecting its own international co-opera-
tion ; and the best way to make it understand
is to tell its people about it one at a time.
In fact, telling the people is about the most
important thing to be faced in the period of
reconstruction. Secret diplomacy has been
denounced, but it is not yet dead. To make
it other than secret will require not merely
a negative abstention from giving out the
truth, but a positive determination to make
every position fully known and understood
by the man in the street. Britain, I ranee
and America have understood why they were
in this war better than any nation knew why
it was in a war before; the nations must
understand why they are in the new peace
better than why they were in the old one
that ruptured so easily. Only on a founda-
tion of knowledge can a League of Nations
stand with any permanency.

Political Economy in Schools.
Dear Bulletin, —Political economy isn't a
conspicuous subject in the State school sylla-
bus —in fact, it isn’t a subject at all, though
some fragments of it happen in under “His-
tory” or “Moral duties” or other headings.
Yet the rudiments or bones of political
economy, as distinct from the controversial
features, are more important than brush-
work and might even rank with mensura-
tion. The infant hasn’t long left school
when he becomes an elector, and lie has
hardly left school before he is qualified to
help in making the Labor Parliamentary
programme. Yet though he was filled with
much remote geography and defunct battles
with spears, it is almost certain that no one
taught him the interesting story of the
world’s paper money—a matter which inti-
mately concerns him. He probably doesn’t
know that paper issues without any adequate
coin reserve behind them —issues secured on
“the entire assets of the community” and
with every kind of protection except that of
an office where hard money can be got on
demand—are an old hackneyed common-
place ; that the world is full of them to-day ;
and that the quotation for paper running as
low as Id. in the nominal £, can be found in
plenty of cheap books of reference. Nor
does he know the story of the many coun-
tries which have tried bimetallism, and
those which issued paper payable in gold
alongside paper payable in silver, and the
results thereof. Consequently when he tries
his prentice hand at drafting a political pro-
gramme he is apt to start from the purely
aboriginal point of view, thinking, on the
advice of some deceptive axe-grinder or of
some one as ignorant as himself, that irre-
deemable paper or bimetallism or some such
device is a perfectly new experiment, and
worth trying. He thinks his friend discov-
ered it and communicated the secret to him
as a favor. There is no reason why any elector
shouldn’t be an advocate of irredeemable
paper or bimetallism, but seeing that these
arc among the subjects on which it is pos-
sible to do amazing damage he shouldn’t
start to manage them in a state of perfect
ignorance and learn at the expense of the
community. It is too much like leaving an
infant in charge of a powder-magazine and
allowing him to learn that powder explodes
by exploding it and the neighborhood. A
slight knowledge of the land systems of
different countries and different periods
might be helpful, ranging from personal
ownership by the sovereign down to the
communism of the Russian mir and of New
Australia. And something might be taught
about the mixture of races and the results
thereof without any needless incivility to--
wards races that are mixed and can’t help
it. Even repudiation of the public debt
might be included in the elector’s education,
so that lie will have an idea what countries
have bilked their creditors, and when the
device paid, and when it didn’t pay, and the
reason of the difference. Then the budding
repudiationist would have something to go
on. History with the public debts left out
omits a most useful feature, for the inven-
tion of public debts jolted politics into a
new orbit. Also the tale of universal military
service systems is helpful to the infant who
has to assist later on in organising the
defence of a continent. Brushwork and men-
suration are valuable, but a sovereign re-
quires to know politics, especially the finan-
cial side of politics, above all things. In
this line the 2,202.801 sovereigns who issued
their ukase at last election had been
educated almost wholly on the voluntary
system, and this country long since voted
voluntary education a failure. —Yours, etc.,
Horace Cheese.

BRANCHES in VICTORIA AND SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Mr. William Webster.
A fortnight ago The Bulletin published
the letter of a correspondent, who signed
himself “W.P.”, complaining that certain
telegrams lodged and paid for in Sydney
had not been sent, and that neither sender
nor addressee had been notified by the De-
partment until, a fortnight later, inquiries
were made. The Bulletin has received
from the Postmaster-General the following-
reply to its correspondent’s letter
Your leaderette on the Post Office and the Censor-
ship is palpably false and misleading. It is also
cowardly and contemptible; likewise ridiculous and
childish.
It is untrue when it seeks to father on me' the
result of a Proclamation issued in August, 1914,
which is mandatory. This is clearly set out in the
circular you reprint. Hence your offence is deliber-
ate. You know that both censorship and refund
are governed by the Proclamation, and your attempt
to involve me is characteristically unfair.
It is misleading, as are most of your criticisms
of the Postal Service, besides being unreliable.
Such, however, seems to have become a mania with
The Bulletin of late, so obvious to the unbiased
reader as to call for pity rather than comment.
It is cowardly when it attempts to lie by infer-
ence regarding the alleged ruse to prevent overload-
ing of lines, which is not true, and therefore
inexcusable.
It is contemptible when it seeks to base on the
inferred lie a charge of unworthy motives against
this department.
It is ridiculous when it suggests that postal
assistants should be allowed to censor telegrams
when submitted. Imagine the howl The Bulletin
would set up if such idiotic advice were adopted.
It is childish when it appeals to the business com-
munity to kick against what has been declared neces-
sary to prevent irresponsible people circulating mis-
leading, pernicious, or seditious matter through the
postal channels in time of war. Business people
as a rule know and respect the law. It is the sen-
sational press and the scaremonger, or worse, that
tries to evade it, and expects the money to be
returned in the event of failure.
The foregoing shows how a one-time respectable
journal can fall from grace, and sacrifice principle
to prejudice.
After which pretty exhibition The Bulletin
will merely remark: (1) The Bulletin
wrote nothing on the subject; (2) “YV.P.”
was as much responsible for what he wrote
as “William Webster” is for what he
writes; (3) “W.P.” didn’t complain that
Webster censored a telegram—what he did
complain of was that after taking money
to send telegrams Webster’s Department
notifies neither sender nor addressee that
they can’t be sent, and hangs on to the
money; (4) Webster is evidently not in a
fit state of mind to control anything.
God Forbid!
A cable mentions that Israel Zangwill
would “like to meet the distinguished Jewish
soldier, General Monash, who was designed
by Providence to be the first Jewish Gov-
ernor of Palestine.” Modern Palestine is
mostly dust, flies, fleas, sand and smells.
The seat of Government would be Jerusa-
lem. For many years, up to the time the
British entered it. Jerusalem had been one
of the most insanitary and comfortless cities
on earth. An impartial modern chronicler
remarks of it: —
There is no municipal water-supply and the main
drain of the city discharges into the Pool of Siloam,
which has become an open cesspit. In several places
the debris within the walls is saturated with sewage
and the water of the Fountain of the Virgin and of
many of the old cisterns is unfit for drinking. . . .
There are from time to time outbreaks of typhoid,
small-pox, diphtheria and other epidemics. This is
due to want of proper drainage, miasma from the
rubbish heaps and contaminated dust from the
uncleansed roads and streets.
It is without a race-course worthy of the name.
Its hotels are a by-word, and the restaurants
are unspeakable. There are no good clubs,
bars or cigar-shops. A man might search
the city for days and not get a game of
100, billiards or poker. As a matter of
fact, there is no betting of any sort, the
inhabitants being very broke. Motoring is
practically impossible, as the soft limestone
roads are in a chronically ruined state.
There are no theatres or opera-houses—not
even a vaudeville show. As a city in wffiich
to display diamonds, tall hats, patent-
leather boots, new clothes, and similar evi-
dences of wealth, it is useless. And finally,
in the whole of Palestine, the capital city
included, there are under 20,000 Christians.
lIoW ludicrous to dream of an up-to-
date and progressive Hebrew patriot
condemning himself to such an en-
vironment ! It is like expecting the typical
all-wool Irish nationalist to live permanently
in Ireland. The Zionist, like the Sinn
Feiner, has more useful as well as more
congenial work to do else-where. Zionists,
like Zangwill and the Rothschilds, settle
in the comfortable portions of the earth,
amass large fortunes from the Christian
inhabitants, and spend a little in boosting
the cause of Zionism. Sinn Feiners, such as
O'Rafferty and the Mui.doons, work for
the cause of a free and united Ireland in
places like New York, Chicago, Sydney and
Melbourne; and they take particular care
not to leave those pleasant cities for any
length of time. The practical Sinn Feiner
—the person who does the fighting on the
spot, as opposed to the academic patriot
who merely subscribes funds from a tre-
mendous distance—is liable to have a name
like de Valera or Markiewicz. The resi-
dent Zionist is never, by any chance, a
civilised modern Hebrew. For one modern
Jew to try to bluff another into settling in
a place like Jerusalem amounts to an un-
friendly move; if, indeed, it isn’t actionable
by the "Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Hebrews.
While Hughes in Paris is arranging for
the Commonwealth to control German New
Guinea and the Hun islands of the Pacific,
State authorities in Australia are busy
knocking the Commonwealth authority to
splinters. The Constitution gives the Com-
monwealth control over “trade and com-
merce with other countries and among the
States.” “The movement and personal
intercourse of individuals engaged in com-
merce, or entitled to be so engaged,” Quick
and Garran say, “is a branch of commerce.
The arrival and departure of passengers
from one State to another, and the em-
barkation and disembarkation of passengers
by sea, is also a branch of commerce.” There
is no question that in these matters certain
State authorities have deliberately defied
Commonwealth authority. Whether they
have done it with the sincere intention of
protecting their own particular groups of
Australians or whether they have done it
because they saw good political advertise-
ment in jt, need not be considered now.
The certain thing is that the State authori-
ties believe that they are strong enough
to stand up against the Federal authority;
and it has come actually to this—the other
day, in the matter of the handling of cer-
tain soldiers, the N. S. Wales Government
intimated that it would have on hand a
QUEERED.
“Nice time for a blinkin’ caricaturist!”
sufficient body of police to carry out its
own plans. Australia dare not let this
drift continue.

A letter from an Income-tax payer:—
The Federal Tax office keeps its joints from rust
by sending out a “Final Notice” in a promiscuous
sort of way. It is an adult piece of paper and
demands “returns in writing in the forms hereunto
annexed” (great quantities of paper annexed) of
the recipients’ income for the years to June, 1915;
ditto, 1916 ; and the same, 1917. And it finishes in
this sledge-hammer fashion: —•
“AND TAKE FURTHER NOTICE that unless
a satisfactory explanation is furnished to ME
before the 12th February, 1919, of your neglect to
lodge returns before 30th November, 1915, 31st
August, 1917, respectively, as required by law,
proceedings will be * taken”... .
Now, I refuse to explain my neglect and the Deputy
Federal Commissioner may take proceedings or influ-
enza or fits or the fancy of a pretty girl, or he
may take to the bush and start bushranging. I
won’t explain my neglect, for I haven’t any neglect
about me, and I can’t expound imaginary substances
—prophecies, sea-serpents and myths generally. It
would be as reasonable if I asked .the Deputy Com-
missioner to explain why he is a black Jew from
Cochin-China, born on the 134th of February. To
put the matter shortly, I sent in all the returns, and
paid all the claims, and got (and still have) all
the receipts. Possibly some one backed a bob-
tailed horse with the money. Perhaps it was
entered in the wrong book, or in a book that is
lost, or under the wrong name, or in invisible ink,
or maybe there are so many clerks that three of
them are trying to do one clerk’s work, or possibly
they are the wrong kind of clerks, or by chance it
may be the wrong kind of a commissioner. Again,
there may be superfluous stationery to get rid of.
I wouldn’t like to hint that it may be a “try on,”
yet it is said that if you send a whisky bill to 10
teetotallers two of them will pay it by accident, and
if you telegraph to 10 bishops that the crime has
come to light three of them will never be heard of
again. That is the law of averages. Anyhow, I
hope the Deputy Commissioner won’t take so many
proceedings against me that there will be none left
for other people. I would hate to see him run
short of proceedings. Sooner than that I would
take some against him for annoyance, superfluousness
and tedious repetition.
From a well-known biologist:—
Knowledge of the present plague is limited; its
assumed germ of origin has not been located, for
those vaccinated with the seemingly-pure filtrate
from the identified organisms have had the disease.
Strangely, these associates of the true organism,
when dead, prove a valuable vaccine to modify the
true germ’s energy. Apparently the new ’flu is the
same old ’flu we know so well, only in instances
with an extra energy gained in the fertile soil of
the war-weakened victims of Europe. This theory is
supported by its great ravages in the poorly fed of
India, and amongst other people with small physical
resources. The toxine of a strange microbe, given in
minute quantity to our body-cells, teaches them at
leisure how to deal with a large quantity quickly;
or the toxine uses up all the food for its invading
organism in the blood; or it makes the food un-
palatable. All three theories have supporting facts;
but none are proved. It is highly probable that
there are no new diseases, and under like conditions
diseases are always the same; otherwise, if they
could have evolved beyond a fixed limit of varia-
bility, all life would long ago have succumbed.
“Scrutineer”; When Holman agreed to
Wade’s condition that Cohen was to get a
Judgeship as a reward for abstaining
from opposing the formation of the Coali-
tion, he didn’t think
the thing was
loaded. Latterly,
however, he has seen
very clearly what it
means and wouldn’t
in the least have
minded repudiating
the bargain, but the
Wade section of the
Cabinet insisted.
Then Holman tried
cajolery, and even a
knighthood was men-
tioned ! But there
was no buying Cohen
off. Holman might
as well have tried to
get a bit of pork out
of a shark’s jaws.
Cohen wanted that
£l5OO a year for life
and —well, the tax-
payers will have to
find it There was
at the same time an-
other “honorable un-
derstanding,” even
more shameful, to
put a discredited
politician on to the
Supr e m e Court
Bench. That also
the taxpayers will most likely have to stand.
The conspirators have first “tried it on the
dog” with regard to Cohen.
The official returns of the ravages of the
black ’flu in Maoriland from October 1 to
December 31 give a tally of 5959 deaths—
perhaps not all definitely due to the scourge.
Auckland district (1892) suffered most,
then Wellington (1537), Canterbury (775),*
Otago (481), Southland (456). Of the
cities. Auckland lost 1013 citizens; Welling-
ton, 655; Christchurch, 477; Dunedin, 302.
This week a cable message declares the
’flu’s attack to be entirely spent.
“Small Chemist” : Public mention of any
drug as a weapon against the ’flu invariably
puts the substance on the curio list. Some
reckless paper declared that oil of cinna-
mon was a useful specific. That day, on
trying a wholesale house for a couple of
ounces, costing about 10s. in pre-war times,
I was told I could have loz. for £2 15s.
Declining to be profiteered I next applied
for camphor, and was informed that there
was none on hand. It seems that one or
two brokers recently got hold of all stocks,
and now the wholesalers can only book a
few orders at the brokers’ own price. Plea-
sant band of philanthropists we’re living
among, eh?
At the request of the representatives of
both machine parties. Labor and National,
the Petersham (N.S.W.) by-election is post-
poned as long as possible. Public meetings
are off by reason of the plague, and
an election, without public guff would
be something unheard of. But it
would he a thrice-blessed experiment.
The candidates would publish their policies
and they couldn’t say they had been mis-
reported. Questions would be asked in the
press and they couldn’t say they hadn’t
heard the interrogator. Their answers
wouldn’t be muffled by the clamor of the
people. Nothing would be said on the spur
of the moment. Nothing would be suppressed
by a reptile reporter. The halt and the
lame and the deaf and the feeble would hear
the details as well as the robust folk who
like crowds and trampling on each other’s
feet. And the meeting would be authenti-
cally open day and night—in fact, if one
cared to preserve the published statements
in a scrap-book it would be open after the
carldidates were dead.
Sands and McDougall’s Yic. Directory had
its 63rd birthday last month. It is now
a portly volume of 3090 pages and shows
a fine record of growth in almost every
department. “Alphabetical” fills more than
a third of the book, and “Suburban Streets”
occupy nearly another quarter. “Agricul-
tural and Pastoral” seems comparatively
emaciated with 187 pages, but doubtless it
will develop into a tome on its own as soon
as Millen’s Repatriation Department gets
busy.
Ex-Speaker Cohen (N.S.W.), now Judge,
when Chairman of Committees some 10 years
ago used to have things enlivened for him by
the incorrigible Jack Meehan, member for The
Darling. Jack’s favorke pastime was to
greet him every night he took the chair with
“Pork chops !” Of course the present Judge
scon evened things up a bit with the aid of
the Sergeant-at-arms. But presently “Pork
chops” used to come in a muflled ventrilo-
quial tone that was very hard to locate. Cer-
tainly it was done in an Irish accent, but
a man must not be fired out on circum-
stantial evidence; -also under the standing
orders if a man says he didn’t in Parliament
his word must be taken. In fact, the readi-
ness with which an M.P. is believed
(officially) inside the House compensates
in a degree for the doubt that surrounds him
when he is anywhere else.
“G.P.” waves his scalpel:—
Vic. Premier Lawson says that he sat for hours
with his medical advisers on Monday night (Jan.
27), and that they declined to certify that Melbourne
was an infected city. He adds naively that it
was not until they got the result of a post-mortem,
on Tuesday morning that they did so. All pure
bluff, for a post-mortem would reveal nothing fresh.
Besides, they had plenty of opportunities to hold
post-mortems in the Melbourne hospitals during the
last month or so. As to diagnosis, one man who
had returned from Melbourne put his nose into Rand-
wick Hospital and infected a nurse, a doctor, and
every patient in the ward. What were the resident medi-
cal officers of the Melbourne hospitals thinking of
when treating similar cases for weeks? And where
was the clinical acumen of the honorary physicians
under whose care these unfortunate patients were?
Had the disease been a notifiable one it is likely
that a Health medico, on visiting the home of a
suspected case, would have noted that the contacts
were seedy and had a rise in temperature. As it
was, the patients were rushed into hospitals and no
questions asked. The baccili had a high old time,
400 cases occurring before it was acknowledged'
that it was the real Mackay. And Sydney then had
to diagnose it for them. Oollins-street is humbled.
Dr. Clive Newland, of near Adelaide, was
found dead the other day by the side of his
smashed motor bicycle, at a level crossing
on the main road near his home. He was
a son of Simpson Newland, pioneer and
politician, and a brother of Dr. Hal New-
land, a leading Adelaide surgeon, now at
the war. Another brother was Phil, the
international wicket-keeper, who died slowly
as the result of a heavy blow in the face,
received at cricket practice on board ship.
Webster’s Comic Post Office has just
topped the score, rung the bell and won in
a canter. A Bananalander perspiring on
the Condamine attempted to send a tele-
gram addressed “G. Morrison. Five Dock.
Sydney.” Webster’s Post Office accepted
the message and the money and then un-
leashed its lightnings. After a decent inter-
val the man up in Bananaland was handed
this official memo with the stamp of the
Condamine office on it: —
Memo from Sydney.
P.M., Condamine.
Yours G. Morrison, Five Dock, Sydney.
Telegram undelivered. No such street known.
The wild Bananalander who received this
streak of lunacy in exchange for his good
silver turned the memo over and wrote on
the back :—•
Dear Bulletin, —Could you tell me where this
Sydney suburb of Five Dock has gone to ? It used
to be" up the crick a bit. If you find out where
it has got to you might let Webster’s crowd know,
as it would save a lot of bother.
“8.T.” : Victor Daley and I, off to a Shaks-
pearian matinde at the old Aleck, in Russell-
street, paused in Bourke-street to take some
slight refreshment. Here a dark, hook-
beaked gentleman, with a startling resem-
blance to Svengali, greeted Daley with effu-
sion. Daley responded with the dubious air
of a man who is not certain what it all
means. A quarter-of-an-hour later we met
Svengali 11. again, this time standing under
the three balls of his place of business in
Exhibition-street. “Ah,” said Daley, “now
I know him. I didn’t recognise him apart
from his context.”

Except the Masque this blessed week

As masqueradings go;
We walked with muslined nose upturned
Past all the theatres interned —

BORED PATRON.
The Strategy of Susie.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“f World’s Great Sketch Artists —
Reen£ and Renaldo, Direct from
New York,” otherwise Susie Smith
and Joe Bailey indirectly from Auck-
land, walked wearily up the straggly main
street of Whakanui, carrying what luggage
they had left. Their personal wardrobes
consisted of the clothes they stood up in,
most of Joe’s being hidden by a long, ulster-
like, grey coat that had “actor” cut unmis-
takably into every line of it. The luggage
contained their professional clothes, for the
average actor will sell his immortal soul
before he will dream of parting with his be-
loved “props.” Joe and Susie had already
sacrificed their immortal souls, but they
hadn’t made a particularly brilliant bargain
of the business, for, when they made a brisk
and highly effective entrance into Whaka-
nui’s best pub, their total available assets
consisted of two shillings and sevenpence.
They didn’t even possess return tickets to
anywhere; so Whakanui was their dead
finish.
Mick O’Brien, minus his coat and with
his shirt sleeves rolled up to his elbows, was
behind the bar counter talking to two men
about the chances of his nag in the jumping
event at the local show the coming week, and
he looked as if he had prepared specially' to
receive and repel actors. When Joe Strolled
into the bar, doing his utmost* to appear as
prosperous as possible, Mick suddenly turned
and glared at him in a manner that caused
the actor to come to the conclusion that un-
reasonable suspicion must be the chief local
product.
Joe, however, had caught enough of the
talk to know that it was about jumping-
horses and he deftly turned this knowledge
to account.
“Any good jumpers in these parts?” he
inquired, lightly, as he rested his arms on the
bar.
“I’ve got the best- horse at that game in
the district,” Mick told him, proudly.
“I must really have a look at it in action,”
.Too said, interestedly. Then, without the
slightest sign of a blush, he added: “I have
a couple of good ’uns of my own over in
Sydney.”
“Always glad to meet a man who knows
horses,” remarked Mick, and then Joe knew
that he only had to do one thing to make
matters right. So he tossed a florin on to
the counter, said his would be a whisky and
soda, requested the two bar ornaments to
be good enough to name theirs and told Mick
to have one himself. Joe’s manner and pose
was magnificent, all the actor in his make-up
flashing to the surface at the call of neces-
sity. And it takes a real actor to part with
two shillings for one lone drink and to look
like a millionaire on a total capital of two
shillings and sevenpence.
So suspicion was driven into ' hiding and
Joe and Susie got the best room in the
Crown Hotel, plus a private sitting-room
with a roaring fire blazing in the grate.
Naturally Joe was more than a trifle
fl&ted over his success. In fact, he was
inclined to throw out his chest and congratu-
late. himself heartily on the way he had"
engineered the whole thing. As matters
stood just then this was most unfortunate,
for he should really have been doing the
meek and lowly act in an endeavor to pacify
Susie. He had quarrelled with her that
morning over coming to Whakanui; for
Susie had been strongly in favor of abandon-
ing the tour and making straight for Auck-
land.
Joe had a definite object in view in making
Whakanui. On the following Wednesday the
annual district show was due to happen
there, and Joe felt convinced that, if he
could keep Mick O’Brien at bay for a week,
get his bills printed and out, and a couple
of good notices in the local paper, he could
safely rely on a £5O house on show-night.
And to Joe just then £5O seemed like
unheard-of wealth.
So on Thursday morning Joe went out and
booked the local hall for the following Wed-
nesday night. Then he sauntered round
to the office of the Whakanui Chronicle.
It was there that he, encountered the first
real obstacle to the programme he had in
view.
He had blown into the untidy office like
a fresh sea-breeze and had spread out on the
dirty counter the matter for his bill and the
“copy” for a gorgeous 12-inch ad. and for
two really beautiful “puffs.”
“I want a hundred bills, quick!” said
Joe briskly. “I want this ad. to occupy 12
inches on Saturday and Tuesday. I want
one of these locals to go in each issue and I
want the account to be sent to the Reene
and Renaldo Company at the Crown Hotel
before 10 o’clock to-day week.”
But Joe’s acting was entirely wasted, for
the lone and elderly clerk wasn’t impressed.
You want to see Mr. Kidston,” he mum-
bled, dully, indicating a door on the left
marked “Editor.”
“Ri’ buck !” said Joe lightly, gathering up
his papers and preparing to make a studied
and striking entrance-into the editorial sanc-
tum. An actor who attempts to finance a
tour on two shillings and sevenpence has
to do most of his acting before the show
commences.
Joe’s gaiety evaporated suddenly when he
had passed through the door leading to the
editor’s room ; for, seated at a paper-littered
table, he beheld a shabbily-dressed parson.
“Ah.... Good morning,” murmured the
parson wearily.
Joe pulled himself together and briefly
explained his wants, again laying special
emphasis on the instructions about the ac-
count. Then he handed over his “copy.”
The Rev. Aubury Kidston, who, besides
being the shepherd of Trinity Church, made
a side-line of publishing the Whakanui
NOT SO BAD AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.
DEAR OLD PARTY (to returned soldier who has been issued with an artificial leg) :
“Why, Mr. Fitzpoodlepup, I ’ewd as ’ow you'd lost a leg!”
LIEUT. FITZPOODLEPUP: “Why, so I have.”
D.O.L. : “ Oh, well, I’m main glad to see you ain’t lost your foot as well.”
Chronicle thrice weekly, took Joe’s stuff as
if it had been a consignment of plague
and scrutinised it suspiciously. Joe waited
in fear and trembling, something instinc-
tively warning him that he was up against
real trouble.
“Dear brother,” he said, in his best pulpit
manner, “you belong to a—er —a profession
that I do not countenance. If you proposed
to give readings from Shakespeare, or from
the classics, or if you desired to give a
magic-lantern entertainment, I would gladly
do your printing and accept your advertise-
ments. But I cannot encourage vaudeville.
Good morning.”
When Joe got out into the street he stood
for some seconds grasping his “copy” as he
looked back savagely at the newspaper
office.
So “The World’s Greatest Sketch Artists,”
with a cash capital of sevenpence, were in a
bad fix. Even Joe with all his optimism
failed to distinguish evbn a glimmer of hope
ahead, and he spent the remainder of the
morning vainly wondering how they could
possibly make their escape from Whakanui
After dinner Joe adjourned to the bar,
for his credit there was still good. Over a
couple of drinks he casually sounded Mick
concerning the Rev. Aubury Kidston. As
luck would have it Mick chanced to have
that morning’s Chronicle spread out on
the counter before him.
“He’s a bit of a wowser, like all the par-
sons,” Mick said, “but lie’s really not a bad
sort. The poor devil has an awful job to
scratch along and has to run this rotten
rag to try to keep things moving. Just
now, for instance, his stipend’s about six
months behind and I notice lie’s advertising
special musical services for Sunday to rake
in some extra cash. I wouldn’t be a parson
for all the tea in China.”
Joe had a look at the parson’s publicity
effort and decided that it had the poorest
pull of any advt. he had ever, seen. He
borrowed the paper from Mick and took it up
to Susie to show her how little the parson
knew about the art of drawing a full house.
For some minutes Susie was thoughtfully
silent. Then she got up abruptly and left
the room. Joe went on reading the paper,
expecting her to return at any moment, but
it was almost tea-time before she came in.
She was wearing her hat and was slowly
pulling off her gloves.
“Where on earth have you been?”. Joe
asked, in surprise. •
“Been arranging to make that damned
parson take your ad. and print your bills,”
Susie told him, as she dropped wearily into
a chair and began to take off’ her hat.
“You have?” Joe queried, as if he hadn’t
heard aright.
“7 have,” Susie said, definitely. “I called
on the parson’s wife,” she hastened to ex-
plain, “had afternoon-tea with her, nursed
the baby and was perfectly respectable.”
Then Susie blew out each of her gloves,
folded them carefully and sat looking re-
flectively into the fire.
“Gee whiz!” she exclaimed, with a little
laugh after a short silence, “it was real
funny. Of course, I had to dig up the
parson’s wife, but she seemed glad to see
me when I found her. I explained that my
dear husband —that’s you, Joe —and I take
a great interest in church work although
we are on the stage. Then I nursed the
baby and did the demure-innocent act for
all I was worth. I’m some actress all
right, Joe, although you don’t know it. I
got a chance to confess that I found my
greatest joy in the singing of sacred music
and from this I worked round to asking if
Mr. Kidston would mind me singing in hi’s
church on Sunday evening.”
“You sing in church?” Joe burst out,
incredulously, with another roar of laughter.
“Don’t be so fresh, Mr. Baily,,” said
Susie, with studied primness. “Besides,
didn’t I travel to the boards via a church
choir?”
“Well, what happened?” asked Joe,
interestedly.
Mrs. Kidston said she was sure her
husband would welcome the suggestion, and
she’s going to discuss it with him to-night.
I’m going round to see her again in the
morning. Somehow I have a feeling that
it’s going to come off, and that you’re going
to get your bills and the notice in the
paper.”
“What makes you imagine that?” Joe
inquired, for he wasn’t so sure about it.
“Because I told Mrs. Kidston,” Susie
confessed, with a sly smile, “that you were
arranging to get your bills from Auckland,
but that I thought if I were going to sing
in the church it would be better to get them
printed locally and up at once. I explained
that if they came from Auckland they
couldn’t possibly be up before Monday and,
of course, I didn’t forget to point out that,
in the interests of the church funds, the
more publicity I get before Sunday the
better.”
“Susie, old girl,” Joe remarked, repent-
antly, “I take back every word I’ve ever
said against your business ability.”
“Don’t bother,” Susie told him; but she
didn’t mean it.
The following morning Susie again set
out for the parsonage, while Joe hung
around the pub in fear and trembling. By
II o’clock she was back bringing a hopeful
smile with her.
“I’m to sing ‘Abide With Me’ and ‘He
Wipes The Tear,’ ” she announced, gaily,
doing a few steps of pure joy in the centre
of the sitting room and ending with a reck-
less kick at the acetylene gas pendant.
Then she added, breathlessly, “Let’s have
a glance at that ‘copy’ of yours before you
bolt round to the newspaper office with it.”
Susie scrutinized it closely when Joe
handed it over.
“It seems fairly right,” she admitted after
a time, “only vou want to call our show
‘refined vaudeville,’ with tbe accent on the
‘refined.’ Don’t forget that.”
Joe didn’t, and when he handed his stuff
to the Rev. Kidston the parson promised
to make the bills a rush job and apologised
for what he termed his “sad mistake of
yesterday.”
The bills went up on Friday night, and in
addition the parson had special cards
printed and freely distributed advertising
his musical service and announcing in big
type that “Myrtle Reene, of the famous
Reene and Renaldo Company,” would sing
two special solos. Saturday’s Chronicle
came out with a column of glorious “puff,”
written by the parson, concerning Susie and
her interest in church work. It was headed
“Actress and the Church,” and contained
the information that “Myrtle Reene” would
sing at Trinity Church on Sunday evening.
For the first time in his life Joe went to
church twice on Sunday; but he reckoned it
was worth it to see the packed house' at
night and to hear Susie sing. She was in
splendid voice and she looked and sustained
the role of demure innocence to perfection.
The only other thing that interested Joe
abcut the performance was the jingle of coin
in the collection-plates. It almost made him
regret that Susie had neglected to stipulate
for a rake off.
Tuesday’s paper contained a column
about Susie’s effort in the church and drew
special attention to the coming performance
on Wednesday. The leader was headed
“Church and Stage” and contained an
eloquent plea for a better understanding be-
tween the two. These were the Rev. Aubury
Ividston’s methods of returning thanks for
a record collection.
Joe got an £BO house on show-night and
Susie got the reception of her life, the fre-
quent applause being led by the Rev. Kidston
from the front seats.
Next day Joe paid all his bills and the par-
son and his wife saw them away by the
afternoon train bound for the next town on
their list to start a highly successful and
profitable tour of all the smalls.
“Just fancy!” chuckled Joe, with a
happy grin, as the train pulled out and Susie
turned from the ’window, after weaving a
farewell to the Rev. Aubury Kidston, “I’ve
got sixty pounds in my pocket.”
“Remember wdio put it there,” said Susie.
“Have a heart, girlie,” pleaded Joe.
JOHN PATRICK.
In Sydney, Melbourne and most other
populous parts of Australia theatres and
picture-houses are closed; and in Sydney
public bars have the padlock on. Whether
the ’flu that has got abroad is a new ’flu or
merely the old ’flu with’an extra kick isn’t
settled ; but, anyway, it is killing people, so
everybody agrees that the sooner it is
stamped out the better, and the people, with
very few exceptions, have taken all the re-
pressive measures like lambs. The most
striking exception has been a church section,
which has howled so about the prohibition
of outdoor seiwices that on that subject the
spine of the N.S.W. Ministry is visibly
softening.
Randolph Bedford, in reply to “From
over the Border”:—
Where’s the use of attempting to sidetrack the
fact that th.e Queensland Government has cheapened
every food commodity it controls? Says this beggar
of questions: “In 1914, before Ryan took charge,
Queensland was the cheapest State.” He should put
it this way: “In 1914, before profiteering became a
fine art, Queensland was the cheapest State.” The
Government controls meat and fish, and these are
cheaper; it doesn’t control rent and bread and beer
and boots and clothing, and prices of these commo-
dities have skied. Meantime the profiteer roars
against the Government because it has cheapened
meat and insurance.

The A.8.C., having the foundations for a
much larger business than it was doing,
took a short cut and acquired a lump by
buying out the City Bank, paying £302,500
for the lot. According to the City’s last
published balance-sheet (June, 1917) the
A.B.C. bought:—•
Liquid assets .. .. .. £875,876
Advances .. .. . . 1,569,337
Premises .. .. .. 192,123
£2,637,336
Less liabilities .. .. .. .. 2,170,154
Net assets .. .. .. .. £467,182
That allowed for a writing down of about
£lOO,OOO. Now turning to the A.B.C.
accounts we get these results
Dec., 1917. June, 1918. Dec., 1918.
Paid capital . . £1,198,679 £1,198,679 £1,198,679

Premises .. . . 350,214 494,736 479,001
►So we can arrive at something like this: —
Increase in Figures for 12 Months.
Due to City Due to Other
Bank (approx.). Causes (approx.).
Debts to public .. £ 2,170,000 £1,106,606
Liquid assets . . 507,500 801,885
Advances, etc. .. 1,520,000 325,183
Premises . . . . 142,500 13,713
Of course those figures are only an esti-
mation. But they are near enough to allow
us to say pretty definitely that, even as-
suming the A.B.C. held all the City Bank's
deposits, fixed and current account, it has
oeen favored during the year with over
£1,100.000 besides; and if it has held all
the City’s borrowing connection, it has
found customers for over £300,000 besides,
in addition to those that have called for
assistance to take up war loans. “Advances
against war loan and under Government
guarantee, £600,944,'’ are included with the
liquid assets.
In one of the foregoing comparisons it
is shown that £40,000 has been paid off
inscribed deposits during the past year.
Those inscribed deposits were accepted on
condition that the bank paid off £15,000
per half-year. Apparently the bank pur-
chases at a discount and is making now
about £5OOO per half-year on the trans-
action. It would be quite legitimate to
show this as an addition to visible reserves.
Either this is being done by including the
discount as trading profit (which would be
objectionable), or the accounts are squared
by writing down premises or other assets;
the E.S. and A. Bank, in somewhat similar
circumstances, writes down premises. But
this is fairly obvious: the A.B.C.’s share-
holders are now having their position im-
proved at the rate of £lO,OOO a year by
the purchase of £40,000 worth of deposits
with the £30,000 which the bank is bound
to employ in this purchase operation.
On the £30,000 a year basis, the bank
will have some of the inscribed deposit
money for very nearly 50 years, though they
may of course be got rid of sooner. They
may thus be almost regarded as capital; and
they certainly offer a fine extra security to
ordinary depositors, who come in ahead of
them in case of trouble. The excellent
security offered has put more money at the
disposal of the directors than they can find
profitable use for at once; and on Decem-
ber 30 the liquid assets represented over
9s. in the £ of the liabilities apart from
the inscribed deposits. There was at the
some time less than £3 of ordinary deposits
for every £1 of shareholders’ funds and in-
scribed deposits. The foundations are there
for still more business, notwithstanding the
City purchase.
There appears to be a general movement
among Australian banks to cut out the
half-yearly meeting in the summer and re-
port * only once a year—preferably after a
June balance. The A.B.C. announces that
it intends to ask the shareholders to agree
to this.

The Commercial of Australia still has a
long way to go before it cleans its slate as
the Queensland National has done. Though
the old trouble is not sitting on the co.’s
chest so heavily as it used to, there is still
alleged to be a deficit of over half a million.
Capital is £2,213,009, made up of £2,117,350
in £lO prefs. fully paid (representing old
deposits) and £95,659 —191,318 ords. paid
to 10s. But from that total capital is
deducted £582,660 “estimated deficiency in
connection with the Special Assets Trust,”
the concern into whose care the worst of
the old wreckage was passed. Nowadays
most of the profit left after paying the
pref. dividend is used to re-instate capital.
Combining the Trust losses with the
bank’s figures gives a truer view of the
present position:—

Lately this deficit has been worked off at
the rate of £30,000 each half, and if that
pace can be maintained the last of the old
troubles should be swept away in about
nine years. Probably the clean-up could
be hastened, but no doubt the management
is anxious to see solid contingency reserves
built up before it leaves the penitent’s stool.
In March last the C.B. of A. bought
out the little National of Tasmania, which
had a good connection in the Speck’s north
and west. The National’s profits for its
last five years averaged about £9lOO each
half, but the purchasing bank’s disclosed
profits have not benefited to anything like
that extent, naturally, because the capital
which it paid for the business had to be
drawn from other investments. The
National’s last balance-sheet showed these
figures:—
Free deposits . . £389,994 | Liquid assets.. £269,907
Fixed deposits _. . 332,176 j Advances, etc. 736.970
Other liabilities 17,215 | Premises, etc. . . 23,940
The Commercial’s assets and liabilities at
December 31 last, compared with a year
ago and before the war, were as follows:

The bank is now holding slightly over
£BOO,OOO more of Government money than
it had. in hand a year ago. Deducting this
and presuming that none of the National’s
£722,170 was lost, then the private deposits
have grown by £1,131,491 during the 12
months. The calls to help finance the wheat
pool and war loans have had a big effect
on the holding of liquid assets: a year ago
47.4 p.c. of all liabilities were within easy
reach; the proportion at December 31 was
just under 80 p.c. At' ordinary times this
would be regarded as sailing close to the
wind ; but under present abnormal conditions
the position is all right. Speculative
advances have not been entertained, and
a lot of the other money out —the big wheat
and war loan advances —is as safe as the
backing of Australia can make it.
The Commercial of Australia has the use
of a lot of cheap money in its pref. capital.
When the old creditors accepted these shares
in place of their deposits, the dividend rate
was fixed at 3 p.c. p.a., to be increased
to 4 p.c. when the bank shook, off the worst
of the wreckage. The prefs. have been
getting 4 p.c. since 1914. They can never
get any more, unless „ they make a com-
promise with the ordinaries, who, notwith-
standing the small amount of capital they
represent, exercise a lot of power, because
their 10s. has the same voting strength as
the prefs.’ £lO.

“During the year,” says the report, “the
Board decided, after full consideration and
in view of the arguments put before the
Boyal Commission, to separate that part of
the co.’s business which was not directly
connected with the ferry traffic.” So the
old co. has been divided into three:—
(1) Sydney Ferries, Ltd., which runs the passen-
ger and vehicle traffic and holds the entire capital
in the two new concerns ;
(2) Harbor, Land and .Transport C. 0., Ltd. (capi-
tal, £lOO,OOO in £l. shares), which has taken over
“certain freehold and other properties and other
assets” : and
. (~;). i-ai(non and Rivers Lighterage Co.. Ltd.
(capital, £30,000 in £1 shares).
All the transferred properties now figure in
the subsidiary cos.’ balance-sheets, and the
gap in the Sydney Ferries’ accounts is filled
by a new entry: “Investment in other cos.,
£107,000,” Some idea of how the properties
have been divided can be got by comparing
the present fixed assets of the parent co. with
those shown 12 months ago:—
1917. 1918. Decrease.
Landed pronerty . . £168,221 £75,819 £92,402
Ship property .. .. 323,283 290,317 32,966
Wharfs . . . . 40,141 38,109 2,032
Plant and machinery . . 7,275 5,241 2,034
That accounts for £129,434 of fixed assets
which have disappeared from Sydney
Ferries’ balance-sheet during the year. No
new boats were added to the fleet, and one
small river packet, the Gannet, was sold,
though it could not have been worth much.
It looks as though assets representing some-
thing like the £130,000 of capital of the
two new cos. have been transferred. But,
as mentioned above, the “investment in
other cos.” stands at only £107,000. Possibly
some of the transferred properties had blis-
ters on them, and the debts have gone over
with the properties. However, the balance-
sheet tells you next to nothing. There is
some pretence in the directors’ report to the
effect that the subdivision of the co.’s inter-
ests has been made as a* sort of concession
to popular clamor. Actually the public can
know less about the whole concern than for-
merly, because (1) the accounts of the sub-
sidiary cos. are not published ; (2) the pro-
fits from each co. are not shown separately
in the holding co.’s balance-sheet. The re-
sults of the operation's of the parent co.
and side-shows are lumped in this entry:
“Net profit for the year (after making pro-
vision for depreciation, etc.), £38,891.” And
by working on the figures in the subsidiary
cos., disclosed profits could be nicely regu-
lated if the directors cared to do it. Thus
the public is more in the dark than ever.
Under present conditions shareholders are
not likely to become very fat. The increased
fares recommended by Commissioner Allard
have helped considerably during the year,
but wages have been further advanced and
the cost of stores, etc., has increased. After
writing off an unspecified amount for depre-
ciation there was a profit of £45.590. Though
this is the best result shown in the table,
the absorption of the Balmain New* Ferry
Co.’s £50,000 capital in 1917 must not be
overlooked. The Commissioner expressed
the opinion IS months or so ago that 8 p.c.
was a fair return to shareholders. The
directors have handed out a 7-J p.c. div.,
which left £l4l to strengthen general
reserves after tacking £6699 to a contingen-
cies and public risk fund, and providing-
something besides for depreciation. But it
is tolerably certain that the co. will 'not
again have anything like the gorgeous time
it had in the past—as between 1910 and
1914 for instance, when £146,373 was re-
ceived in bonus shares by holders, practi-
cally all provided for out of an undisclosed
contingency fund.

i.ast year’s amending Gas Act did it.
Under the principal Act (1912), as clumsy
a piece of legislation as was ever passed, the
standard price of gas was fixed at 3s. 6d.,
and the standard dividend at 10 p.c.; and
cos. were to be allowed to increase the price
if they could show that certain wages-costs
had been put up by Arbitration awards.
The amending Act, while reducing the
standard dividend to 8 p.c. (that is to say,
the co. couldn’t exceed 8 p.c. without re-
ducing the price of gas below 3s. 6d.),
allowed an increase of price if a Judge
certified that costs generally had increased
beyond those of 1912. As was pointed out
here a yAir ago the total cost of coals, oils,
etc., had then increased 37 p.c. on the 191 a
figures, and works exes., apart from wages,
had increased 27 p.c., whereas wages-costs
had increased only 21 p.c. It was clear
from this that the amending Act was going
to suit the co. very nicely; and after
Justice Ferguson had gone into the accounts
he certified that the increased cost of pro-
duction was Is. 2d. per thousand. In 1914
the co. was charging 3s. 6d.; gradually the
price was got up to 4s. l|d. in 1917; at
the beginning of 1918 it was 4s. Id.; lat-
terly it has been 4s. sd. The directors, in
view, no doubt, of the surplus just shown
have now reduced it by Id.
Under the old Act the amount which r.
co. might stuff away to provide for renewals
and various other things was supposed tc
be limited to p.c. of the capital outlay or
buildings and plant. This lay-by is now
limited to purposes of depreciation. An
account has therefore been opened and
£20,216 had been paid into it out of revenue
for the past year. For replacement of
plant £986 has been paid out, leaving this
account in credit £19,230. Reviewing the
last few years we get this result

Compared with 1917 the past year shows
an increase of 17 p.c. in the revenue and
11 p.c. in the outgoings. The amending Act
was very good indeed to the co.
Justice Ferguson was not, of course, con-
cerntd with the standard dividend. Parlia-
ment fixed that at 8 p.c. The Bulletin
insisted that it was too high, taking all
things into consideration; and that view
is supported by the fact that the market
quote of this co.’s shares is nearly 25 p.c.
over par, even in these days of dear money.
But in arriving at his figures as to costs
the Judge accepted certain principles and
followed certain practices which are bound
to be contested. (1) With regard to resi-
duals, lie simply took the amount which
the co. had realised and deducted that from
the cost of production. Something has been
said about the waste of gas cos.’ residuals;
and if things are so arranged that cos. are
just as well off if they don’t sell residuals
as if they do. then a premium is held out
to waste. (2) Gas cos. work usually on
share money and borrowed money. The
Judge, in figuring out total costs, ‘ allowed
8 p.c. on share money and ii p.c. on bor-
rowed money in addition to the interest
actually paid. Why? It may be argued
that shareholders should get something for
their risk: they are responsible for this
money. But the question is whether that
is not taken into account in fixing the rate
on the capital, more especially as 3| p.c.
p.a. is allowed for depreciation on capital

outlay, borrowed money or otherwise. The
point concerns this co. less than some, be-
cause while its share capital is £525,675, its
borrowed capital is only £146,125; and
rather chan largely increase the latter
amount the co. is now offering 25,000 shares
at auction —the method required by the
Act.
After a lot of argument —during which
the bears had a gorgeous time—Gundagai
Long Tunnel (N.S.W.) is out with a clean-
up of 4500 z. gold from 448 tons, plates to
come. The crushing included 152 tons of very
low-grade stuff —going only a couple of
’weights—about which there was a rumpus.
To get the ounce average the directors say
that no bonanza stuff went through the
battery. If so, John Allen’s average assay
of 17dwt. 13gr. looks a fair thing. But
where does Harper, of the Mines Depart-
ment, stand? His report, following on the
yarns put around by the bears, froze the
market. Even now there are some people
who won’t have it that the stone from the
winze below 300 ft. did not include a rich
patch which was fluked just in time to save
the position. However, manager Hepburn
sums up the mine prospects as “exceedingly
good,” and reckons the battery will have
something even more pleasant to say to
shareholders next time. Two, or perhaps
three, crushings are said to be in sight, and
the optimists are still building castles on
the possibility of a bonanza coming to light
about 20ft. ahead in the south drive of the
No. 3 level. Three crushings won’t make a
mine, of course. But apart from the fact
that the battery is ahead of the mine, the
show is under a cloud as a result of geolo-
gist Harper’s report. The directors say
they appealed without success for a further
investigation by the Department; and seeing
that the battery and John Allen’s report
have come into the argument since the official
opinion gave shareholders cold feet, some-
thing should be done to clear the atmosphere,
even if only in fairness to L. F. Harper, who
is not an apprentice, but has engineered some
big things—the Hill End resurrection, for
instance.

put through each w T eek, returning a ton
to 23cwt. concentrates for the fortnightly
clean-up. These results are paying exes., and
are even said to give a return of Bs. a ton.
When the second 10-hd. is put up within
the next couple of months the- quantity
treated, if calculations don’t wander, will
be 480 tons a week. A profit of 12s. a ton
is looked for under these conditions. The
first unit required 3s. in calls, and the
same amount is regarded as likely in the
case of the new installation. Meanwhile
the Mt. Tennyson Co. is pushing on with
its stampers and ball-mill, and should be
treating stone in March. The early
future of the field depends a lot on B.H.
Prop.’s opinion of the Mammoth ground,
over which it holds an option. The option
expires in June next, and already the area
has been tunnelled and bored all over the
place. Some nice-looking stuff is said to
have been brought to light, and local opinion
is that the B.H. Prop, is there to stay.
* * * *
While the big tunnel is being driven from
the southern to the . northern end of the
Hill End field (N.S.W.) to unwater the
lower levels, which are virgin, the cos. are
producing just-payable stone, with some
showing a profit. Deep Levels has nothing
to hurrah about in its 61oz. from 105 tons;
but Marshall’s is getting 2oz. stuff from its
middle reef. Deep Levels is busy at and
about 260 ft. The principal trouble just now
is water ; supplies are being hauled from the
Robert Emmett shaft near the battery. The
biggest job in hand by the Central is the
sinking of the old Patriarch shaft 200 ft.
from the 500 ft. level, so as to link up with
t lie lower tunnel, which is going north with
Government assistance. A trial crushing is
being extracted from the Mica vein at 500 ft.
* * * *
The parties which have acquired a title
to the dumps on the old Lucknow goldfield
(N.S.W.) have been advised that an assay
of stuff lifted from the heap at the abandoned
Reform mine is worth £1 16s. a ton. This
is reckoned good enough to warrant the put-
ting up of a plant on the spot, and the pre-
liminaries are under way.
With drives into the deep ground, New
Langi Logan is proving that the Cathcart
tributary enriches the Langi lead. The last
clean up of 2oz. stuff came from a drive
right at the junction of the two gutters, and
although it was small it would in pre-war
days have led to a bit of a flutter among
alluvial men. The job now under way is
to link up the north reef drive on the east-
ern side of the Langi lead with the Cathcart
workings to the west about 200 ft. away. To
do that Toole will put No. 2 rise into the
gutter and at the same time work out east
from his balance-shaft wash drives. That
work done he can divert a lot of water,
besides satisfying himself as to the width of
the run of gold from which returns have
been coming of late. Toole has still to
get men into the panelling line, but he hopes
for recruits when more Diggers come back,
for the mud in his mine won’t be worse
than that in which they floundered in Flan-
ders.
As several Kalgoorlie (W.A.) mines have
lived after being pronounced dead, a warn-
ihg is being directed to cos. by local people
against calling in the undertaker too soon.
Years ago South Kalgurli was supposed _to
be on its death-bed, yet to-day it is looking
well and should be able to pay more divi-
dends before long. The Associated North-
ern was considered to be so far gone that
most of the plant was removed to another
mine. But a small tribute party, who ap-
parently knew something, stepped in and
opened up a new body of ore from which
a clear profit of £40,000 is expected.
Boulder Perseverance pulled down its blinds
and arranged for a burial service some time
ago, but tributors have done so well since
that the date of the funeral has been put
off. Golden Ridge, according to an official
announcement, breathed its last about nine
months ago. Its remains and belongings
were sold to a second-hand machinery dealer,
who passed them on at a good profit to a
party of miners. -They are said to be work-
ing the show with some success.
* * * *
Undismayed by past failures —there have
been about four to date—Golden Butterfly
is making another effort to find a mine in
Westralia. An option has been secured on
some leases at Burbridge on the South Yil
garn field, and with £l2OO in hapd the co.
proposes to get busy on development. The
previous owners are said to have taken out
and treated 500 tons for an average of £6
per ton, but whether there is anything left
to work on is not stated. Possibly it is
another blind stab in the hope of striking
something worth having.
* * * *
Phillips River copper- and goldfield
(W.A.) is depressed again. This time the
local mine-owners have got their back up
because the Mines Department cannot see
its way clear to reduce smelting charges. So
operations are at a standstill.
From J. L. Strevens
Re New Wallsend coal (W.A.). Not only is the
newly-discovered 12ft. seam the hardest coal in the
Collie field, but it has the highest calorific value and
can be worked very cheaply. The Wallsend leases
close up with the Cardiff and Scottish, thereby pav-
ing the way to combination, decreased working costs
and production of better-grade coal. Collie requires
a little more harmony among the five cos. working
there, and a better understanding of the possibilities
of the field, especially when briquetting has been
introduced successfully to give Newcastle the count-
out for the coal-trade of Westralia and S. Aus.
W. L. Baillieu’s talk about zinc and the
making of other things at Risdon (Tas.)
seems to boil down to the fact that in two or
three years the plant will have worked up to
an output of 100 tons electrolytic zinc daily,
plus side-lines. So, after all, Bull .should
not be subjected to a very heavy strain as
the result of the agreement with the Broken
Hill mines to buy their zinc output for 10
years. But it looks as if Britain will have
to place a lot of zinc concentrates, and may
have to sell them in the same old way to
the same old buyers once peace and goodwill
prevail among the nations, including the
Hun. What would be real news would be
to be told if W.L., with his usual skill, has
got all the tangle out of the hitch in the
proposed Mount Read and Rosebery agree-
ment with the Electrolytic Zinc Co. Time
appears to be the essence of the contract in
that matter, for a rally of the Speck’s
northern members is being engineered to
prevent Lyell dodging from the King River
scheme. By the way, the portents are that
the B.H. Prop, intends sidling out of the
atmosphere into which it drifted when it
made its sale of the Pirie smelters.
Things are not working out too well at
Lyell Blocks (Tas.). The latest trouble
is that the water at 1300 ft. is so heavy that
work at that depth has been stopped. This
leaves the manager to complete stoping at
1200 ft., and. releases him to go after the
copper clays at or above 520 ft. How Frank
Duff would cheer if he knew that his old co.
was being shunted back to the hunting-
ground from which he and W. R. Wilson
started when they shoved Lyell Blocks off
on to the market! Boring in the bottom
levels has apparently fizzled out, as the
drill and its accessories have been shipped
back to Melbourne. The co.’s first dis-
appointment was in Tolhurst’s time, when
it was discovered that the North Lyell shoot
had turned back into that property. The
last blow is the failure to prove that the
shoot of rich bornite struck by the Lyell a
few feet from the Block’s boundary hadn’t
enough strength to cut across the border
line. West Australians plunged a bit on
Blocks, and unless Sticht wants the shaft
for the North Lyell they cannot expect more
than a small liquidation div. out of the
show.
* * * *
John Craze, manager of Round Hill
(Tas.), is still opening up his new lode.
It is now explored for 140 feet in length
for an average width of nearly 20 feet, and
is maintaining values. There are some very
rich patches in it, and the average of the
concentrates is 45 p.c. lead, 85oz. silver and
4dwt. gold. This is highly payable if Craze
can produce a quantity. About 4 tons of
hand-picked firsts have just been shipped,
which will probably assay 500 oz. silver,
15dwt. gold and 50 to 60 p.c. lead to the
ton. This lode has been struck in the
lowest level, and there are about 300 feet
of backs above it. It remains to be seen
how far it will go up. In the past the
metal has been very patchy, and usually
low in silver, but it must be remembered
that previously there was no lode showing
in the mine—merely veins of metal in joints
in fractured country. Apparently these
emanated from the lode. At the present
time the main ti'ouble is water, though this
has now been overcome by installing a
suction-gas pump in the creek.
* * * *
Director of Mines Oliver, of the Northern
Territory, recently went to see if the
Coronet Hill shaft he had directed to be
sunk on the line of lode had proved any-
thing. All he got was a look at the dump,
where he saw some low-grade copper ore, for
the water was pretty well up to the windlass
in the shaft. Still, the cupboard was not
altogether bare, for the lode “has a pair of
splendid walls.” It is quite like old times
to hear this gag again, but walls no more
settle whether Coronet Hill has any solid
reserve of ore than does the belief that as
the drive goes ahead better material will
make. What Oliver has to do is to get
back the few thousands the Commonwealth
has lent the co. He puts up a mild sug-
gestion to Minister Paddy Glynn that a
boring campaign should be set in train. His
reason is that scarcity of labor makes it
necessary to stab the vitals of the mine that
way. But what about a general report as
to the figure at which copper must stand
if Coronet Hill is ever to run- a smelter
at a profit?
* * * *
Though it has a Kimberley (which grows
good spuds) the . Speck is not usually
reckoned amongst the diamond producing
countries. But it has yielded at least 16
and probably 18 dinkum diamonds, besides
several cwt. of what the people who found
them reckoned to be real sparklers. Most
of them were about &th carat, and one
reached £rd. These diamonds all came from
the Donaldson range country near Corinna.
The “Killiecrankie diamonds” from Flinders
IHand, which caused some stir in London
years ago, turned out to be a kind of topaz.
Twelvetrees, Government Geologist, doesn’t
advise anyone to go diamond hunting, but
bints that prospectors for gold and osmiri-
diurn should keep an eye cocked when in
likely country.
* * * *
J. L. Strevens, an English oil-man, re-
cently had a look at the Koumac shows
(New Caledonia), and has returned with
samples of oil from a seepage which has
been drained since 1904. Bitumen in situ
was picked out, not only at Koumac, but at
Noumea, the chief town. 150 miles south.
The old Oswald bore, drilled to 1000 ft. ten
years ago,. was found to have been put down
in a syncline, or trough, instead of on top of
the nearby anticline, and oil never occurs in
synclines. In the Koumac district there are
numerous gas shows, and, what is regarded
as equally valuable as evidence of petroleum
below, frequent sulphur springs. The Bris-
bane co. seems to have mis-spent £lO,OOO
boring near the seepage in fractured country.
In other lands oil-wells are never drilled
near seepages, because the seepage or flow
of oil shows it can escape from the oil
sands, which are therefore nearly always de-
nuded of their oil contents. Strevens says
that geologically the rocks are correct for
petroleum and that the whole island is
folded as it should be. But it will take a
lot of money for surveys, roads and modern
machinery.
* * * *
. I-'ast week the price of tin concentrates
in Sydney dropped to 425. per unit, equal
to £147 per ton for a concentrate assaying-
-70 p.c. tin. This is really a good price
compared with the pre-war figures; but
sluicers and others are dismayed at a slump
from 70s. to 425. per unit, which means a
reduction of £9B per ton of 70 p.c. stuff.
* * * * *
. The Vulcan (Q.), Australia’s deepest lode-
tm mine, has been shut down indefinitely. Re-
sults were so poor during the last half-year
that the directors resolved to see what a
new manager could do with a staff of his
own choosing ; but as that wasn’t agreeable
to the local A.W.U., the manager was in-
structed to close down, and the works at
Irvinebank followed.
Rhodesia has decided to be up and doing
in the matter of raising money for prospect-
ing. Headed by what is known' as the
Resources Committee, a movement has been
started to raise a million sterling in England
for a big gold-and-other-minerals hunt.

Laurens Armstrong, N. S. Wales District
Court Judge, would probably win first prize
if all the Judges of Australia had to sit for
an examination in languages at Easter. He
was one of the best “classics” turned out
by Professor Badham and lectured on that
side at Sydney Uni.; and besides the classics
he has French, Italian, Spanish and Gor-
man, and enough of Russian and Arabic to
carry him through. The Laurens probably
comes from the mother’s side. Dad was Cap-
tain Armstrong, R.N., a Crimean veteran;
mother belonged to a jersey family.
The busted Kaiser may be a neighbor of
ours yet. According to a message from
Amsterdam the Dutch and German Govern-
ments have agreed that Wilhelm should be
exiled in the Dutch East Indies, which perch
on the Equator—a sort of half-way house to
Hell.
Alec Thomson and F. S. Boyce have just
said no to a N. S. Wales District Court
judgeship.
Raymond Gee, R.M. of Geraldton (W.A.),
hath a classic wit. Recently the Court
House was being re-roofed. During the
hearing of a case (and the re-roofing) one
of the counsel remarked upon the possibility
of the ceiling coming down upon them.
“Yes,” said the R.M., glancing upward,
“it’s possible, but we’ll have to risk it.
Fiat justitia ruat ceiling.”
Harry Stockdale, who died in Sydney last
week, aged 78, knew a horse as well as most
men. He started Jto learn the animal nearly
69 years ago, when he was dropped on to
an uncle’s station and was thrown much in
the company of Adam Lindsay Gordon and
other hard riders. Like Gordon he had the
pen-itch, and made innumerable pictures of
innumerable horsey. A born bushman, he
found it hard to settle down to anything—-
including the book he was always going to
write about Black Brother. Of late years
he had been more successful on Sydney pony
courses than almost anybody except the
people who own them.
A Melbourne artist had a commission to
paint Bigjohn Forrest for some patriotic
society in the West, and John gave the
painter a few sittings. The second sitting
was rather protracted, and John grew more
and more uneasy as the moments crawled
by. At length he blurted out: “Look here,
young fellow, if you don’t hurry up I’ll out-
grow that canvas.” But the committee at the
other end was responsible for a better joke
in the same vein. It wrote asking what the
artist would want to do another por-
trait of Bigjohn at the age of 30. The artist
named the same price as for the present-day
picture. “Most unreasonable,” replied the
committee’s secretary—“you would not be
at half the cost for material!”
Judge Backhouse, of the N. S. Wales Dis-
trict Court, is likely to spend his last two
years on the Bench as an Acting-Supreme
Court Judge. It will not be the first time
he has stepped that high. Twenty-five years
ago the Ministry gave him a commission to
try the Broken Hill conspiracy cases—the
trials that opened first prison and then Par-
liament to Sleath and Ferguson.
“Laurie” Armstrong, newly appointed
Judge in N. S. Wales, became Chief Censor
in Sydney when Professor Wilson resigned ;
but the job didn’t suit him —he had to do too
many things that he couldn’t see either
rhyme or reason in. He was a very human
Censor while he lasted. One Sydney news-
paper got into correspondence with his office
over an absurd decision. The usual reply
came—to the effect that a Censor couldn’t
come to an absurd decision. The newspaper
continued the correspondence. For a while
the office sat on its high horse ; then, finally,
a reply came from the boss: “With reference
to our correspondence on this subject I con-
sider you have won both game and set.”
Probably no other Censor ever made a con-
fession quite like it.
The double position of Director of the
Adelaide Conservatorium of Music and Pro-
fessor of Music at the University there,
vacant by the resignation of J. M. Ennis,
has been given to a
local man, Harold
Davies. He is a
Welshman by birth,
but has been in S.
Aus. since he was 19
(he issl now). Organ
and choral work are
his strong points, but
he has a thorough all-
round knowledge of
music, was the first
“Doctor” of it in Aus-
tralia, and has the
reputation of being a
sound man of business
as well as a musician.
He was the founder of
the local Bach Society
and other serious
bodies. Walford
Davies, the London
composer, is his bro-
ther.

In its Ladder of Success column on Thurs-
days the Melbourne Herald has not yet
included the notable example of “climbing”
related by the late Tommy Bent, and con-
firmed by his friend Dr. L. L. A city
publican, who married his barmaid, gave a
lavish feast in honor of the event. In re-
sponding to the toast of the occasion, the
bridegroom said: “There’s no tellin’ the
heights to which one may rise in this
countliry. This morning that gurrl (point-
ing to the bride) was just an or-din-ary
bar-maid. To-night she’s the wife of the
vice-president of the Licensed Vic-tu-al-lers’
Ass-so-she-a-slie-on of Osthra-lia Felix!”
The oldest Metliody minister in the
Commonwealth is said to be Joshua
Foster, of Prospect, South Aus. —89
on December 27. He put on the
white tie in England in 1852, but
came to Australia two or three
years afterwards.
The N. S. Wales Bar has boycotted the
swearing-in of a Judge before to-day. The
appointment of the late Justice Hargrave
in 1865 was so unpopular that the wigs
absented themselves when he was sworn
in. Judge Cheeke was promoted to the
Supreme Court Bench the same day. He
was popular on and off the Bench ; but he
had to take cnd shoulder with Hargrave.
Since Professor Bragg returned to Lon-
don, to go on with the radium research
which has since earned him—with his
Adelaide-born son—a Nobel prize, the mathe-
matical work of Adelaide University has
been divided between Chapman (Engineer-
ing) and Kerr Grant (Physics). It is now
thought necessary to have a professor of
mathematics solely, and Dr. J. R. Wilton
has been invited to come back from Eng-
land. He is the sou of C. R. Wilton, of
the Advertiser, and went on from Prince
Alfred College to Adelaide University, where
(under Bragg) he took a B.Se. at 19. Since
then he has acquired an M.A. and a D.Sc.

Mackey, Speaker of the Vic. Assembly,
worked as a compositor in the Government
Printing Office while studying for the Bar.
The printing office was temporarily at the
Exhibition, and Mackey’s “case” was just
about the spot where the Speaker’s chair
now stands. Should Pledges or Hood retire
soon Mackey may get the Supreme Court
judgeship he missed when Cussen was
selected.
Bishop Stretch, who wears his apron at
Newcastle (N.S.W.). but proposes to take
it off on June 30, came from Geelong, where
he was born in 1855. His name stands
first on the roll of Trinity College, Mel-
bourne.
Michael Kelly, w T ho signs his name with
a cross, will be 69 on February 13. He
succeeded Cardinal Moran in 1911. The
next cardinal will probably be a Melbourne
prelate. Mannix is expected to bring a
Red Hat back from Rome this year.
Died in Sydney J. R. Holding, postmaster
and bushman. His father was one of the
first men on the lower Darling; the son
entered the post office as a boy and. though
often of late years invited to come in closer,
preferred the bush, and got no nearer
civilisation than Broken Hill. He had pro-
bably studied backblocks meteorology harder
than any man living.
J. W. Larnach, dead in London recently,
was of Australian - birth, son of Donald
Larnach, a miller, who was for years
director of the Bank of N. S. Wales. The
well-gilded son married a daughter of the
Earl of Cork.
Just dead in Canada, Major-General Sir
Samuel Benfield Steel, late O.C. 2nd Cana-
dian Division. Many Australians will re-
member him as Colonel Sam Steele, second
in command, under “Barnum” Powell, of
the S. African Constabulary. Steele came over
FOSTER, M.H.R.
to S.A. in command of Strathcona’s Horse,
at whose name the Boer curses to this day.
When that famous, not to say notorious,
regiment went home, “Old Sam” stayed
behind to do the hard work of organising
the S.A.C., while “Barnum” got brain fag
designing beautiful green-braided uniforms.
As Steele had been commandant of the
Canadian North-west Police he made quite
a success of the job, and the S.A.C. became
an efficient force in spite of B.P. and his
countless hangers-on. Then B.P. got bored
and departed for home, leaving all his green-
braided friends to their fate. Steele sup-
plied the fate. Later on the Dutchmen
became top-dog again and abolished the
S.A.C., and “Old Sam” went back to the
N.W.M.P.
Died in London Samuel Hardy, of Hardy
Brothers, the Sydney jewellers, aged 76. In
the ’fifties John and Samuel Hardy estab-
lished themselves on the spot where the
firm's business is still carried on; but
presently Samuel returned to London to
look after the firm’s interests there.
G. F. Holden has had his term as Chair-
man of the Melbourne Harbor Trust ex-
tended for four years on condition that the
Government is not to be hampered in such
reforihs as amalgamating the Melbourne and
Geelong trusts. He was formerly member
for Warrenlieip in the Assembly, and in-
duced Bent to make him Chairman of the
Geelong Trust. Then he persuaded Watt,
when State .Treasurer, to promote him to
the £l5OO a year job he has now held for
six years.
A new idea in memorials is being worked
out by the Corangamite (Vic.) Federal
electorate, represented intermittently by the
late Chester Manifold, of Camperdown.
The 'M’Arthurs, Omans, Mackinnons and
others of the local squattocracy have sub-
scribed to buy a bust of the amiable but
undistinguished deceased, with the intention
of sending it up to Melbourne to be added
to the furnishings of the Parliamentary
library. The “Mechanics’ Institute” at
Camperdown seems to have a greater claim
on it.
This seems to be a record in loneliness for
a woman teacher in Australia. Miss Elphick,
in Adelaide for the Christmas holidays, has
for a year had charge of the school at Mulka,
on the Birdsville track. To get to Mulka
you go by train 441 miles to Marree (train
once a fortnight), and then drive for three
days. When you get there, if it’s summer,
you tie your head in mosquito net to protect
your eyes from the flies and start the young
idea (also in mosquito net) on the road to
learning. Mulka had an inch and a half of
rain last year.
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Living in the
town of Gisborne-(Vic.), hale and hearty
is Henry Kettle, without a doubt the oldest
Victorian-born. He was launched at “The
Settlement” before Melbourne had a name,
on July 14, 1836; he was baptised by the
Rev. Waterfield in the big room of Johnny
Fawkner’s pub, and Johnny declared that
little Henry was the second white child born
at the Settlement. The first, said to have
been the son of a blacksmith who had
crossed with his wife from Launceston, was
drowned in the Yarra. Kettle, senr., was
one of five appointed to devise means to
erect a Congregational Church. The other
four were Waterford, Fawkner, E. M.
Sayers and John Aberline. Sayers was the
first member of St. Leonards in the N. S.
Wales Legislative Assembly, and was the
father of Mr. Sayers, of the Commercial
Banking Co. of Sydney, who still resides on
“The Shore.” From time to time Mr. J. V •
Fleming, of Brunswick, has been mentioned
as the oldest Victorian native alive. But
Mr. Kettle is nearly eleven months older.
THE LOWER DECK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Officers have beer, magnificently backed up by
the lower deck from the moment the Grand I lcet
silently disappeared to somewhere in the North Sea
until the conclusion of hostilities.” — Admiral Jellicoe.
You will not find us in “Debrett,” “Who's Who,” or
“County Families” ;
We do not figure in at-homes or crushes of- at
balls;
We’re just the blokes who man the Fleet —Big Lizzie
or the Ramilies —
But sometimes when we’re ’ome on leave we rambles
round the ’alls
For a bit o’ ease and comfort, for an ’our o’ chat ar d
cheer,
With a pipe a-pullin’ freely, and a girl and glass
o’ beer.
We’ve been somewhere on the ocean chasing Jerry’s
submarines
On a ship that ’asn’t got a name —it’s travelling
incog.—-
Together with some H.O.’s and a bunch o’ might-
have-beens
Who’vs caught on with the best of us and not
shown in the log.
We’re ashore on eight days’ furlough with some pay
—it ain’t a pile—
’Bout enough to buy a pint or two and do the
girl in style.
We do not patronise the Ritz, the Carlton or the
Metropole;
The Angel down at Islington is more the place for
us.
But, when it’s “action stations” and the gong is
going heart and soul
It’s the lower deck what tumbles up, in order,
without fuss
To its places at the guns and sights, the telephones
or tops,
An’ when the scrap is over—well, we ’andles 'ose
and mops.
We was in at Windy Corner (though we’re not sup-
posed to mention it) ;
Some time we’ll get a medal for the work we done
that day:
At least, it has been whispered we will get one and
a pension. It
Sounds too good for gospel—like increasin’ of
our pay.
But we’re optimistic beggars or we’d dropped out
long ago,
An’ we’re great on takin’ chances like we did at
’Eligo’.
You’d ’ardly like to spend a day with us in our
establishment;
Our bed and board is ’ung on ’ooks, and let down
when required;
We’re packed like sardines in a bin—an’ like ’em
do not pay the rent —-
While the officers, like ladies gay, are each by
stewards squired;
But, when it comes to action —strike! It’s action
makes grit tell,
An" the gold-laced ones and white-gloved ones ’ave
been with us through ’ell!
We’ve lived on bully-beef and tack. It seems like
’arf a century
Since ’am an’ eggs w'as on the card for breakfast
or for tea.
Read the stories in the papers of the Navy’s Great
Adventure. We
’Ave ’ad a share in all of it, an’ still are on the
sea.
But Jerry got a gutser, kameraded, skied the rag,
An’ ’is fleet is rustin’ idle till it ’oists a better flag.
So far a grateful nation ’asn’t offered us no peer-
ages ;
All it’s offered us is chevrons for to wear upon our
sleeves,
An’ tells us that our proper place is third-class or
the steerages
When we are off on ’olidays or travelli ig on re-
lieves.
Though we do not 101 l in limousines but take a
penny ’bus
Some day the world may realise the debt it owes
to us.

BLIND TO HIS CHANCES.
SHE ( suggestively): “Isn’t it lovely here —
just you and I together; and we don't
have to wear our masks.”
HE ( wearily ): “No, so a bloke can have a
smoke."
one occasion been displayed by our flagship.
That was when she led the attack on New
Britain and the Australian flag was hoisted
along with the Admiral’s flag at the main-
mast-head. The flag in question was a silk
one presented (I think) by the school
children of Sydney in October, 1913. With
the return of peace the jackstaff will be
re-erected and the Commonwealth ensign,
which takes the place of the jack in lI.M.
Australian ships, will once again be dis-
played by our vessels.
‘ICaloola”: After his discharge a returned
Billjim Avas sent by a city labor agency to
a job on a farm in the country. Most of his
time Avas taken up in looking after a number
of prize fowls that the farmer valued very
highly. Each day he had to collect the eggs
and ma rk, Avith an indelible pencil, on each
the date and name of the hen that la d it
(all the hens had names). This job didn’t suit
Billjim and in a Aveek’s time he Avas back in
the city agency looking for another billet.
“I’ve done a bit of almost everything in my
time for a crust,” lie explained, “but if you
can't get me something better than being a
secretary to a cocky's old hens then
I'll starve.”
“lodine” : The profession does not regard
inoculation as a protection against the germ
that does the actual killing in this epidemic.
The vaccine is made up of the germs of
influenza, pneumonia and catarrh, and of the
tAvo germs which are usually found in pus.
No. one pretends that the specific germ which
slays is in it. As a matter of fact, the dread-
ful thing has" never been seen—it is ultra-
microscopic. Its energy is in inverse ratio
to its size. Its catastrophic efficiency as a
former of pus is amazing. The scientist who
first isolates it will be among the greatest of
mankind’s benefactors —but the world still
awaits him. Meantime the vaccine in usa
represents probably the next best thing. The
effect of it is to counteract ordinary influ-
enza and catarrh, and without them the
lethal germ has less chance of getting to
work. It is Avorth a sore arm, anyhoAV.
“Sol”: For an army commander’s parade
“Birdie’s” farewell to returning 1914 men
at Bray on the Somme Avas unique. Five
hundred Diggers had been formed and re-
formed, dressed and re-dressed to the taste
“Triatic”: “Trevallyn” (B. 23/1/T9)
makes a queer little mistake in talking about
the Australian flag which the Australia
“flew at her jackstaff on the day of the
great surrender.” Probably she flew no
Australian flag at all on that occasion, and
most certainly none at the jackstaff. No
ship of the li.M. fleet ever flies any flag
at the jackstaff Avhen under way; the jack
is hauled down immediately the anchor
leaves the ground, not to be re-hoisted until
the vessel comes again to anchor. Further-
more, during the war, as ships were sup-
posed to be always cleared for action
(which involves unshipping the guard-rails
along with the jackstaff), the jack has been
altogetlicT discarded, so that at no time,
either in harbor or at sea, has there been
any means of distinguishing the Australia
from any other ship of the British Fleet.
Since 1914 the Australian flag has on only
of three colonels. They Avaited,
a picture regularity and sym-
metry. Two dogs peacefully
exchanged greetings in front of
the serried ranks. Then Bird-
avoocl arrives, mounts a platform
outside the muclidbattered Hotel
de Ville, and gives a friendly
beckon to the boys to come
nearer. A cattle rush was
a tame event compared with it.
The dogs fled before the swing
of legs and boots. The parade
then resembled a Domain meet-
ing, the crowd surging and jost-
ling around the platform. The
Anzac General made a speech—
with touching references to
sweethearts and wives and old
days of Gallipoli comradeship,
which went straight to the Dig-
gers’ hearts. When the tumult
ceased one of the boys, in true
regimental style (salute and
click included), asked the Gen-
eral’s autograph on a five-franc
note.' Soon the little leader Avas
overwhelmed by a clamoring
mob. Then a hard-faced Bill-
jim gave the Avord of command,
“Go on! Up in the air with
’im!" Immediately the Army
Commander was seized by the
legs, hoisted shoulder-high,
carried round the square and deposited in
his car, upon which someone had chalked
“Digger Birdwood.” Away he went in a
storm of cheering, the area commandant of
the place (an old regular) going grey visibly
meanwhile.
About payment of preachers:—
The question whether parsons Avill be abolished or
paid a living -wage can’t be shirked for ever. It is
one that must be put down sooner or later for
consideration at the Tabor Conference. Of course
payment of preachers would involve limitation of
the number of preachers, but that need be no
obstacle. One well-fed, well-clothed and, above all,
intelligent pastor is better than three scarecrows
with retreating foreheads and greenish, threadbare
garments. The existence of any class of underfed
labor in a community isn’t good for the community.
The output of an inferior article through poor work-
manship, whether the article be boilers or sermons,
lowers the average efficiency of the community. A
nation which means to make its mark should abjure
slummocky ways in all things, large and small,
and where the tradesman is unable to reform himself
the work must be done for him in the national
interest. Even if the sects went back to the ideas
of 1800 years ago and hermits became fashionable
again they should be capable hermits and able to
pass official inspection.
“Germtrap” : What is the N. S. Wales Gov-
ernment doing that it hasn’t ordered the male
inhabitants to shave? This is a duty which
Gov. Davidson and Health Minister Fitz-
gerald in particular owe to their fellow-
citizens. These two enthusisasts for hygiene
go about with wisps of insanitary hair under
their noses and about their mouths, mopping
NO DISQUALIFICATION.
SHE: “And hasn't the awful life of tumult and destruction spoiled you for a peaceful.
harmless existence?"
HE: “Well, you see, I happen to he a lawyer.”

providing them with a harbor until they can
find a way into the bronchial cavities, to be
passed on presently to other citizens who
have had a better sense of their civic re-
sponsibilities.

“Oldfield”: Ship stewards will be sorry
when the war regulation prohibiting other
than passengers to come on the wharves is
lifted. On sailing days in pre-war times a
single passenger had any number of fr'qnds
(from one to 20) to wish him good-bye.
Each visitor wanted to see ail over the ship
and carry the chaff and dirt common to
wharves with him. In the most modern
vessels the inouis'tive party would turn on
the tap to see if the hot water was really hot
(generally it wasn’t),
and then dry his
hands on the towel
someone else had paid
to use. Cakes of soap
made nice souvenirs,
and the cabin steward
got rounded on for in-
attention when the
stuff could presently
not be found. Endless
trouble was caused by
rugs, overcoats and
small articles being
missed. I know of
this case. Passenger,

best part.
“Trooper Bluegum” : Abdul’s Intelligence
Department was hopelessly at sea prior to
and during the smashing of the fourth,,
seventh and eighth Turkish armies in Pales-
tine and Syria. Early in September some of
their ’planes came over our lines, and all
were brought down by our invincible airmen.
For a week before September 18-19 not one
hostile ’plane was seen. The whole Austra-
1-an division was brought by night marches
from the Jordan Valley and hidden by day
in the orange and olive groves around Ludd
and Jaffa. Dummy horse lines and fake
dumps and bogus roads were made on the
Jordan side, where Abdul could see them
from the Hills of Moab; and mules dragged
harrows over the dusty plain to make believe
that bodies of troops were on the move. So
the Hun staff feverishly strengthened their
left, while Allenby was prenaring an irre-
sistible blow on their right. The Turk had
no idea, either, that the Australian division
had been transformed from Light Horse into
cavalry Captured Huns told of the dismay
causeu in the Turkish ranks by the apoear-
ance of thousands of Australian cavalry
charging with drawn swords. “When did
your new Australian cavalry land?” they
asked. Billjim’s an adaptable blooue.

At a Melbourne meeting the other night
a municipal politician was talking repatri-
ation with fiery insistence. “Are you an Aus-
tralian?” demanded a man in the stalls.
ALMOST—WELL. VERY NEARLY.
HE: “She's very during. I've seen her walk
right down the street in her bathing
costume."
SHE : “That's nothing. I've seen her appear
in evening dress without her jewellery.”
“Well,” answered the orator, “I am an Aus-
tralian by conviction.” The same voice:
“What were you sent out for?”

I know not, and I do not care to ask,
How the sw'itt microbe leaps upon its prey,
Or whether it is pastime or a task
To grapple human lungs and choke and slay.
I only know that Mabel in her mask
Has absolutely set my wits astray.
I cannot see her mouth ; her little nose
.Is like the flower that hides behind the leaf.
I gaze into her eyes where mischief shows
Like folly dancing on the grave of grief, r
Oh, kissable she is, I must suppose;
And my own muzzled mouth would play the thief.
I never saw her till we met to-day.
Without her mask, I should not know her now ;
But I can guess how little dimples play
By the smooth whiteness of her perfect brow.
And she is kind ; she knows a liver's Avay,
Begging the favor love must still alloAV.
I have kissed both her ears and half her hair ;
On her curved eyebrows has n.y mouth been set.
I guess and guess ; and, though I cannot swear
That she is beautiful, I’m game to bet
Her loveliness will make the whole street stare
And all the charms of other girls forget.
Anri yet I pause ; and in my soul I ask
If I am wise to love her quite so will.
Within the sun of her sweet eyes I bask
And trust the tale her long black lashes tell.
Oh, Mabel, Mabel, lift the shrouding mask
And take me up to Heaven —or down to Hell!

From the Oldest Inhabitant: —
A proposal is before Sydney City Council to
reehristen Moore-street Martin-place. The first-named,
in its primitive state a passage for pedestrians only,
was known as Foxlow-place, after some member of
Sam Terry’s family, whose interests in that locality
were large. On the N.-E. corner of Foxlow-place
and Pitt-street was the City Bank, and on the other
corner, now occupied by the Commonwealth Bank,
was a large softgoods warehouse. When Brougham-
place was changed to Rowe-street, Foxlow-place was
re-named Moore-street, after a former mayor. The
fire of 18S0 swept away a number of buildings about
here and gave the City Council the opportunity of
widening Moore-street under the betterment principle.
Nominally Martin-place was named after a former
Chief Justice; but, of course, it was the fact that the
London Post Office is in St. Martin’s that suggested
this title for the corresponding Sydney street.
“0.L.”: From various medical authorities
in Melbourne I learn that everybody should
be inoculated against ’flumonia and that
inoculation is no good; that children under
eight should be done and that children under
eight should be left alone; that whisky, be-
ing an antiseptic, is a valuable gargle, and
that —whisky? Pish! Also that menthol,
eucalyptus, zinc, borac-ic acid and peroxide of
hydrogen are each the best germicide for
common use, and that none of them has
any value. Further, I discover that face-
masks are no good ; that face-masks should
be worn and have a little eucalyptus and
creosote sprinkled on them ; also that tke germ-
arresting action of the masks has nothing
to do with the use of germicides, being
purely mechanical, the cheese-cloth catching
tlm germs alive and letting them die a miser-
able death on their way to the throats of
their human prey. I learn, too, that an
assemblage of not more than 20 persons is a
fairly safe one; and that citizens who merely
step to converse with one another in the
street are liable to infection. Quinine is a
preventive remedy; but that no preventive
remedy is any good, the only way of avoid-
“ ’AVE ONE WITH ME.”
It has been suggested that the hotels close during
the influ’ panic.
ing infection being the use of a good gargle.
People shouldn’t kiss, but merely shake
hands; and if they shake hands they may
pass the disease round, having previously
sneezed in their hand. Cumpston, Federal
Director of Quarantine, disagrees in certain
matters with Robertson, chairman of the
Vic. Board of Public Health, and the
Adelaide man disagrees with both, while the
Vic. Cabinet has a different set of opinions
from those held by the Ma State’s adminis-
tration. In view of these facts, there seems
little for the private citizen to do but to
make his will, see that there is enough cash
in hand to pay for a funeral, and go on with
his daily job.
A MATTER OF BUSINESS THIS TIME.
FATHER (to Ginger, who has been taken to lunch at a restaurant): “Note, say your
grace, my son.”
GINGER: “Oh, I don’t need to say any here — we’re paying for this lot, you know, father.”
“Smith” Two Diggers were endeavoring
to “hold their own” outside a Bourlce-street
bar. “What is the meaning of those five
stripes?” sternly asked the lady with the
iron face, in passing, indicating the service
stripes on the sleeve of the nearer warrior.
“Red ’un means married, blue ’un for each
kid,” was the brief reply. Then the dame
looked at the sleeve of the other Billjim. It
showed only four blue stripes, ller back
hair bristled- “You wretched man!” she
admonished him. Digger No. 1 thought it
up to him to get his pal out of the difficulty
he had placed him in. “Widower,” he ex-
plained. Then: “Wife died before the kids
was born.”
* * * *
“Guinea Please”: I had little faith in
two or three strips of cheese-cloth filtering
a germ so minute that our best micro-
scopes haven’t yet found it; and the little
esteem I had for the mask was badly rattled
on Monday. In a dirty street, playing in
a dirty gutter, were various dirty young-
sters. “Where is your mask?” I asked one.
“I ain’t got one,” he answered ; “I’m wait-
ing for some bloke to chuck his away.” I
found another group busy trying on one
another’s masks, and incidentally swapping
whatever microbes the gauze had gathered.
* * * *
“W. J. Digger”: The arrival of the Yanks
on the Western Front enriched the lan-
guage. A Scotch-American argument finished
like this. “Laddie,” said Jock, “your
brains wouldna make a respectable meal for
a mouse.” . “See here, stranger,” drawled the
Yank, spitting freely, “if you’d got no more
body than you’ve got brains, you’d have to
climb a stepladder to pat the cheek of a
worm.” A Yankee aviator made a forced
landing at a British ’drome. “Say,
stranger,” he said, addressing the C. 0.,
“are you the Big Noise of this outfit?....
Wall, will it be' interfering with your habits
if I tether my gasolene kite in your pas-
tures?”
* * * *
“E.H.M.”: One drizzly night recently a
deaconess friend of mine, who had been
presiding at a sewing circle, walked to St.
Paul’s corner and waited in the shadow of
the Cathedral for her tram. The tram service
apparently was indisposed that evening, and
she had to linger for a car. She was deep
in ecclesiastical thought when a skirted
shadow approached, and a voice, stridulous,
and inflected with l'ising anger, hit her on
the ear. “Now then, you get out of this!
This is my beat! This is my beat, I tell
you!” Oh, sisters, what a lesson this
teaches us about the infringement of pro-
prietary rights and so forth !
“Churchwarden”: Banker is a hardened
citizen now and could waltz me round the
city; but when he first came down from
the bush he was the greenest thing wearing
boots. The first evening, as we walked
round, I missed young Banker from my
elbow, and, looking back, saw him in ner-
vous confab with Her. “Come on!” I
shouted. Banker flung the old ruin an apolo-
getic word and ran after me. “What in
thunder did you speak to that woman for?”
I asked. He seemed pained at my impati-
ence. “Well,” he said, “the lady said ‘Good-
night,’ so I thought she must be a friend of
yoursi’

“Solomon Malaprop” on tram-cars
A shadow of a possibility exists that the long-
drawn-out Perth tramway stoppage may be the
beginning of a move-
ment for the tearing up
and abandonment of the
old mode of locomotion.
It isn’t very old, but it
isn’t years that count.
In London the motor-
’bus now beats the tram-
car at every point. It
is faster. It is hardly
ever blocked, for there-
is generally room to
dodge through, and at
the worst it can rush
down a side street. It
never comes to grief
through running off the
rails, because it is never
on them. And it can
be withdrawn from un-
payable runs at a mo-
ment’s notice to try its
luck elsewhere. As a
drawback it can be
stolen, but • that has
happened even to tram-
wa y s and railways.
Petrol is a difficulty, but
motor vehicles can prob-
ably be driven by whisky
when man no longer
requires it for his in-
terior. Whisky is a
rapid substance and has
driven many people to destruction.
* * * *
“Mannamead” : I was glad to see “Lower
Deck” (B. 30/l/’l9) pleading the case of
Bill jack. I can bear out what he says, as
I have mot nearly every boatload of Bill-
jims and Billjacks returning to Sydney,
and have seen the latter treated with scant
courtesy even by Y.A.D.’s, who should
know better. It has to be remembered that
Billjack was on duty on August 4, 1914,
and has been on duty ever since. In most
cases he has had quite as hard a time as
Billjim. If he hasn’t been sleeping in
muddy trenches; he has been on duty be-
side his gun, tube, or searchlight in the
icy spray of the Adriatic, North Sea or
North Atlantic—always on the watch—or
else grilling on the Line, and if a man
wants to know the acme of discomfort let
him put in six months on a destroyer in
the tropics. Arriving home Billjack has
been sneaked ashore —even when he came
home on leave aboard the same transport
as Billjim. Billjim sported “Australia” on
his hat and on'the collar of his tunic, and,
further, his battalion colors were on his
sleeves. Billjack was not allowed to even
display the name of his ship on his hat
ribbon—though every German knows the
name, speed, tonnage, personnel, etc., of
every vessel in the Australian Navy. When
he was allowed down the gangway there
were no smiles, cigarettes, and flowers for
him. His job was to dismiss to his home as
inconspicuously as possible and not let any-
one know that he had arrived. It took
quite a long time, indeed, to obtain for Bill-
jack the travelling concessions on trams
and trains given gratuitously to the Anzacs,
and even to-day he can only travel second-
class, where Billjim goes first.
* * * *
“Aywd” : A captured German officer was
talking to some of our boys at a station in
Palestine. This was his brag: “Germany
taught Belgium humiliation ; France that she
was not as strong as she thought she was;
England not to poke her nose in ; America
to keep her neutrality, and' Australians how
to fight.” And now the teacher, having been
walloped, is going to pay the world’s school-
fees !
* * * *
“Q.P.”: While N. S. Wales Health De-
partment was screeching hygiene at the
top of its voice it permitted vendors to
ply their calling of mask-selling from the
kerbstones in Sydney. Dust and horse-
refuse blended with the gauze, and in
one case a sewerage grating was only a
few feet away. On Thursday I counted ten
hawkers within 20 yards—all on the edge
of the gutter—and none had the masks
covered against flies and filth, and the
passer-by breathed on them and pawed them
before buying.
* * * *
“Gleniris”: As to Chinese cafes in Mel-
bourne, “Melb” (B. 30/l/’l9) is right in call-
ins' the growth of these olaces “grossly un-
healthy.” On armistice night, when every-
thing was shut up as tight as a drum, I was
hungry and thirsty and tired, through circum-
stances which had nothing to do with the
glad news, and went around to pretty well
every restaurant in town to see if the bars
were down anywhere. Apart from Denat’s
cubby-hole, the only eatery running was a
Chow outfit in Swanston-street. A furtive
Asian stood inside the door, which he opened
every couple of minutes to let customers out
and admit others—all white neople of the
kind that lives in Prahran or Carlton. There
was a sign in the window, “Supper Now
ON THE MARCH TO FREEDOM.
“Surely you can read this big line?”
“No, boss, nor the little ones either. What
bally language is it in, anyhow?”
Ready,” at about nine o’clock; and John
was still flapping his door to and fro when
I scrowged by in the crowd at 11. As an
Australian citizen the Chow left a lot to
be desired that night.
DESERT NOON.

My little, little love! Girl Allonie!
The way I died God grant you never know.
I cannot pray....Oh, Christ of Calvary
Who suflercd thirst, I suffer even so!
The burning sun, the scorching, burning plain
Spins round, and I, by Fortune's vagaries,
Am stricken mirage-mad—l see again
My distant home ringed round by foaming seas.
The white waves rage to overleap its walls;
The rollers break in thunder on its shore;
And fold on fold the feathery sea-fog falls
And hides my home... .my home in Labrador!
But still I see the rollers mount and race—
God grant me death before the mirage dies!
I fall! I fall, through unimagined space,
To mocking seas, thrice cool to tortured eyes 1
The little treacherous waves fall whispering:
“The deeps are cool —are cool.’’ O Allonie!
Death comes at last with rest and comforting
I wait you....girl in God’s Eternity.
A tattered leaf blown over sand and waste
Uur colonel knelt and read, with eyes grown dim
The faltering lines his dying son had traced—
A message from the dead but not for him.

The difference between one sheet of paper and another is WARREN S.
All the usual grades of Printing Paper are made from the same raw material—just wood. What think
you of the “Romance of a Piece of Wood ?
A great spruce or poplar towering in the primeval forest of Northern U.S.A. or Canada, yielding to the
swing of the axe, stripped of its branches, flung into a mountain torrent, swept by the current to the mills,
ground and boiled and permeated with chemicals, spun like silk upon a wire gauze, sprayed with water,
bleached to snowy whiteness, wound upon huge rollers, pressed between heated calenders, cut and counted
—millions of sheets per week —and then printed and bound into catalogues to assist in selling some of its
brother spruces or poplars, in the shape of pianos, bedroom suites or writing desks? What then is the
difference between one sheet of paper and another ? Again we repeat just WARREN S.
For the word “Warren” merns Standardisation!
All the processes are automatic. It is not left for one
beaterman (as the pulp mixer is called) to use his own
idea as to what is the correct density of the stock,
while the man who follows on the next shift may have
entirely different ideas. Warren’s have designed
mechanical contrivances for every process; and their
staff of chemists by constant experiment and analysis
keep this standard a fixed quantity. Just think what
this means! Good printing paper is made from a
mixture of Sulphite and Soda Pulp. In other words
some of the wood is reduced to paper making material
by means of sulphuric acid, and some by the soda
treatment. The sulphite pulp gives the paper the
necessary strength; and the soda pulp provides the
fine, smooth, even printing qualities. The Warren
method insures that always the same proportion of
these two substances is used, while specially designed
machines and contrivances guarantee year in and
year out, the same treatment of the pulp. Thus

Warren’s paper to-day is the same as last year; and
next year it will still be “Warren s Standard. This
is what the advertiser, printer and designer have been
looking for with eager anticipation. We know,
because everyone is interested in our story. Selling
paper, our travellers tell us, is a delight instead of a
drudgery. We are all enthusiastic because our goods
and prices are right. Who could not sell an article
when it is not only the best but the most reasonable
in price ? Warren’s methods have cheapened
production, and their business ideals impel them to
build for all time, and not for immediate profit.
We have forty sets of Warren’s “specimens of the
printing art ” just opened up; never have we seen
more beautiful pieces of advertising matter. Here
are illustrations in colors, in line .and in plain soft
tones. We will send a set of these specimens free
of all expense, to any approved printer, advertiser,
designer or buyer of printed matter, while the
supply lasts. We can only guarantee forty sets.

The WILDCAT
COLUMN
Hughes evidently hasn’t much faith in
either the permanence or the punch of
Wilson’s League of Nations; hence his hard
fight to have the German islands in the
Pacific passed over to Australia absolutely.
Wilson had, however, got on the high moral
horse before he left the C.S.A., and the moral
quadruped said that the Allies’ cause .was too
noble, etc-, to "have anything to do with
territorial loot. So it looks as if Australia
Avill be put in merely as a sort of bailiff.
The high moral horse, by the Avay, wasn’t
so much in evidence after the Spanish-
American Avar. For the good of their souls
Cuba and the Philippines xvere just put
into Uncle Sam’s pocket, and that was the
end of it.
If Australia is merely the man in posses-
sion of the Hun’s former holdings in the
Pacific, then presumably the bailiff’s princi-
pals, the League of Nations, will pay the
bailiff’s Avages. Some other sort of country
might pay its own Avages by exploiting the
islands and their niggers ; but Australia will
not agree to do anything of the sort. The
islanders of the Pacific have just as definite
rights as the Belgians have; and the League
of Nations 'ought to see that those rights are
preserved. We have no better title to im-
pose our brand of kultur on these people
than the German had to impose his brand
■on us. It would be grossly wrong for the
League to farm out these islands to any
Power, saying: “Hero, this job will cost
you a bit. Squeeze it out of the inhabi-
tants.”
THE NEW JUDGESHIP.
“Judge Cohen was sworn in this morning.”
MICAWBER HOLMAN: “Thanh Heaven, that's
paid !”
After all, it begins to look as though
President Wilson has as keen an eye for
votes as any other party politician. Before
the U.S.A. came into the Avar, and when
the then Allies were hard pressed, Britain
agreed more or less loosely to let Japan
have the German islands north of the line,
Australia and Maoriland taking those to the
south. But the U.S.A. Pacific Coast is
alleged to still boil at the thought of Japan-
ese extension in the Pacific; so the simplest
way out for the President Avas to say “No
annexations” on high moral grounds.
The Conference of Premiers arrived at
one definite conclusion, anyhoAV. In addi-
tion to the repatriation money three States
—Westralia. S.A. and Queensland —want
the Commonwealth to find them £22,950,000
for public works during the next three years,
which is about £5 Bs. per inhabitant, includ-
ing the baby, per annum. In. other words,
they propose to nearly double their recent
loan expenditure Avhile the going is good.
Victoria standp out because it ’ has loan
money on hand; N. S. Wales because it
wants to borrow so much that it is afraid
to mention the amount and prefers to run
by itself; and Tasmania because its hair is
standing on end at the thought of what it
oAves already.
In order to “make the work go round”
there is a movement in Australia to reduce
the hours of toil to six per day for five days
a week. No doubt a man can live on 30
hours’ toil a week. Some South Sea island-
ers manage on about five
MASKED.
“America has prohibited general immigration for
a period of four years.”— Cable.
One point hasn’t been settled yet. Syd-
ney Chamber of Commerce, like a score of
other N. S. Wales institutions, “deplores the
fact that the Health authorities of Victoria
so long deferred notification of pneumonic
influenza.” Of course it is to be deplored ;
but the question arises whether the Ma
State hasn’t got something to deplore too.
Anyway, there is the public confession of
Dr. Purser, vice-chancellor of Sydney Uni-
versity, that during the last three months
of the year, but especially during November,
there were numerous cases of influenza in
Sydney indistinguishable from the cases in
quarantine, and that the death rate was
exceptionally high.
There are s : gns that the “Nationalist”
politicians of South Aus. are getting full up
of the alliance Avith Peake. The Ministers of
that persuasion have hitherto kept quiet;
but for those who have no such solace things
are different. Blundell has always been the
chief spokesman of the “National” faction ;
and at present he has neither office nor seat.
Apparently the quiet life is more than he can
stand, and lately he has made such fierce
assaults on the Tory wing that the Register,
Peake’s mouthpiece, has noAV asked him
to either stop cackling or gather his forces
together and leaA 7 e the perch.
The Federal Government —what remains
of it-—is understood to be considering Avhat
to do with the Interstate Commission, which
expires in 1920. Well, the Government
might do worse than instruct it to draw up
a tariff adequate for the protection of Aus-
tralian manufactures. Somebody wi 11 have
to draw up that tariff; and after all these
years of inquiry the Commission ought
to be able to do the thing more judicially
than the casual party politician who other-
wise will presently be called in to make a
rush job of it.
Matters that the U.S. representatives
object to as tying the 'hands of the Peace
Conference include (1) the alleged secret
agreement between Britain and Japan re
the Pacific islands north of the line; (2i
alleged secret treaty on the part of France,
Britain and Italy re the ports on the east
side of the Adriatic; (3) alleged secret
agreement whereby France, Italy and
Britain promised Damascus to the Sultan
of the Iledjaz,' a useful potentate Avhom they
themselves manufactured out of a mere high
priest. These bargains, and possibly others
which haven’t come to light yet, should be
abrogated, according to U.S. ideas. To Avhich
the natural reply is that if the U.S. had
come into the war on August 4, 1914, in-
stead of sticking closely to business for
nearly three years and only appearing on
April 5, 191), the Allies might not nave
been reduced to negotiating for the support
of Arabian high priests and such like obscure
cattle.
Hutton, formerly in charge of the sales
for the Wheat Pool in S. Aus., stated the
other day that the Adelaide Milling Co. had
offered to assist him in checking the records,
and in one case it Avas found that 31 separ-
ate deliveries of wheat aggregating 50,000
bushels, valued in round figures at £lO,OOO.
had been made to the firm for which the
scheme had no record Avhatever. And he
knew of another instance where duplications
and omissions resulted in an adjustment of
£lB,OOO due by a firm to the scheme. No
Avonder cocky scratches his whiskers and
curses the Government.
The Returned Soldiers’ League (Vic.
branch) demands the abolition of all
Lutheran schools in Australia.
Throughout the war the Com-
monwealth Government
employed an intensive Intelli-
gence Corps, consisting in part
of linguists. These men have
never had authority to sup-
press Avhat in their view- called
for suppression. Their duty
has merely been to nose around
and report to the Tall Pop-
pies. Now that the war is
over, or thereabouts, is the
Defence Department game to
publish the conclusions reached
by these investigators regard-
ing the Lutheran schools in
Victoria and South Aus.?
Most certainly not!
The Bolshevik Government
is now entering its second
financial year. In the first
year its principal revenue was
derived from property and in-
come taxes, but this failed
greatly in the latter part of the
year, so many taxpayers being
murdered or imprisoned or
chased off the premises. This
year the return from these
sources is expected to be almost
nil. The Avorst of the com-
bustible kind of Government is
that it dries up the springs of
revenue too fast.
The United States delegates, who supply
most of the polite ideas of the Peace Con-
ference, have a proposal that submarines
should be totally prohibited in warfare. The
Hun would probably fall on that idea and
embrace it with applause. The use of gas
was prohibited once before, and the Hun
fell on the proposition amid cheers and
nearly broke its neck in the fervor of his
approbation. The result was that when war
began he was the only person whose gas
apparatus was ready.
If man lived by cabbages alone it seems
fairly evident that the more cabbages he
grew the more there would be for him. But
a whole lot of people have the idea that if
10 men grew 1000 cabbages, and thus had
100 each, 20 men by growing 1000 cabbages
can also have 100 each. It is quite true
that men in many cases don’t actually get
the cabbages they grow. But the worker
may be dead sure of one thing: you get
less cabbages than you grow if you don’t
look out; but you can’t get more.
At the next Federal elections Edmund
Jowett, M.H.R. for Grampians (Vic.), will
be given a good go for the seat in which he
takes such pride and joy. Jowett was “men-
tioned” for the Grampians before Cartv
Salmon was under the sod ; and the O.L.P.
lias taken a cue and come forward early with
its selection._ Mark Lazarus is Labor’s
choice this time—a Ballarat lawyer known
all up and down the electorate, a capable
platform speaker, and well able to give
Jowett all the back talk he wants.
Alfred Ozanne, ex-M.ILR. for Corio, has
again been endorsed as Labor candidate for
this constituency, in opposition to ex-
Sergeant Lister, who now holds the seat.
Ozanne, whose record as a member of the
A.I.F. has never received the publicity which
should ■ have followed the allegations made
to his discredit by various persons and news-
papers, will thus have an opportunity of
ventilating his personal grievances; and
those who know him also know that he
won’t let the chance slip. But that won’t
get lnm back into Parliament. The Farmers’
Union has always been rather well thought
of m Geelong and the surrounding region;
ard the change of voting systems will nro-
bably put some whiskered Henry Backbone
ahead of both ex-members of the A.I.F.
There really will have to be a meeting of
politicians to denounce Treasurer MacPher-
son of Victoria as a blackleg. He is going
to help a conversion loan through in f,on
don; but as he was going to London in any
case, he says, and will have some business
of his own to attend to, he insists on paying
his own exes.
The men at the North Bulli Colliery
(N.S.W.) have decided to adopt the “darg,”
limiting the wages that may be earned by
any miner to 14s. 2d. per nay. This is
another outbreak of the absurd old theory
that there is only a certain amount of work
to be done, and it must be made to. go
round- As a matter of fact there is practi-
cally no limit to the work t! at is to be done,
for the simple reason that there is practically
no limit to the comforts and pleasures that
work can supply.
Freights on the Atlantic have been reduced
by two-thirds, and from Europe and America
to Australia by one-half. And Australian
manufactures are still without the tariff that
alone can save most of fhein from either
annihilation or severe wage-cutting when the
nations’ tight for foreign trade begins. The
absence of the tariff that Labor has sunk is
going to mean either low wages or no wages,
and either of them are horribly unsatisfying
at meal times.
State Minister Beeby went lately from
Sydney to inquire for six months at: public
expense into the industrial conditions of
the United States. When last heard of
he was delivering a great political speech in
New York about the war, and explaining
that Australia doesn’t want any of the Hun
islands, which is the opposite of what
Hughes is saying, also at public expense.
Tt is reported that Beeby wi'l drop in at
London. So if a cyclone presently strikes
that great conglomeration of bricks and
mortar it mav kill three Federal Ministers
(Hughes, Cook and Pearce, and four State
Ministers (Beeby of N. S. Wales, Ryan and
Fihelly of Queensland, and MacPherson of Vic-
toria, who has a £4,000,000 loan to renew
at a great lossl. High Com. Fisher and six
Agents-General will make 13 of our great
men in one squashed burial blent.
“Pat O’Maori” has a brain-wave: —
The Sinn Fein party has the chance of its life
in connection with the election of a President of
the Irish Republic. By one stroke it could create
a gust of world-laughter and regain whatever popu-
larity the movement has lost. The simple expedient
would be to elect George V. George has in his veins
a thin stream of Irish blood through a remote
ancestor; but that isn’t the point. The great thing
is that the Carsonites scored as rebels to British
law because they claimed loyalty to the British
King; but they did nothing to prove it. Let the
Sinn Feiners prove their good feeling, which in
their case is more than loyalty, by making that
king their first president, and they win more in an
hour than they and their fathers scored in TOO years
of struggle. What could George V. say about it,
anyhow ? He could, only take oft his crown to the
Irish democracy and blandly and blushingly remark,
“Really this is most embarrassing, .gentlemen; but
—-well —ah—thank you very much indeed.”
SOLILOQUY.
“If I had been called George Pearce instead
of George Washington, I suppose I
should have to deny this.”
Unification gets support in new places.
Large amounts of southern money are in-
vested in the North and millions more are
wanted; but the A.B.C. chairman told his
shareholders a year ago that local legislation
was imperilling the old investments in
Queensland and making new ones impossible.
Now the same authority, referring to the
same State, says that its Probate and Suc-
cession Duties Act —hurried through b.v
the way, to get a bite from the late Adam
Forsyth’s estate —will be “practically un-
workable in many cases.” “The sooner,” he
says, “the very numerous advantages of a
single taxing authority in this direction are
recognised, the better for the public.” So
Unification is something more than a pretty
theory, after all.
WINNING THE PEACE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now we have won the war and cooled the guns
AVith every passing day the toils increase;
And ever through our thought the question runs,
“Have we the strength of heart to win the peace?”
Smashing a foe with shards of flying steel,
And hounding him to ruin with cold ink
Were jobs that made to men the same appeal
As racecourse chances and cool things to drink.
But this vast peace that wraps the world about
Calls for tremendous labor night and day ;
And years may put the victor hosts to rout
If faith should fail or truth forget the AA'ay.
A new, strong foe is always at the gate,
If zeal should flag or stalwart toil decrease.
AVe Avon the war ; but all the harvests Avait
For them Avho, fearless still, shall win the peace.

HE popularity and success of the Vocation is due to the supeiiority
and effectiveness of its patented features, the ingenious inventions
and practical improvements that combine to make it the greatest
of all Phonographs. These exclusive advantages include :
The Keprodwcer
Constructed with utmost precision, the Vocation leproduces
every sound-wave with life-like fidelity. . Its diaphragm ,
sensitive to even a breath and the heavy vibration of a full 1
military band, creates all tones with sweetness 2nd faithful

The Graduola
This important and revolutionary tone-controlling device
immediately places all other Phonographs at a disadvantage,
for no other can offer such a privilege of playing a record
yourself with every shade of expression and tone color that
your musical feeling dictates.
The Toae Chamber
After much experimenting by acoustic scientists, this
highly-improved feature was designed, embodying a system
of tensionised wood and metal resonators, from which the tone
produced is unapproached for characteristic quality and
natural color.
The Automatic Stop
is a mechanical advantage allowing anyone to enjoy the
record from start to finish, undisturbed.

Musketoon”: It’s no slouch -of a drought
that has the western country from the Queensland
border to the Macquarie (N.S.W.) in its grip.
Water is so scarce in many of the tanks and darns
that year-old frogs have not yet learned to swim.
“Gouger”: It is quite true that ’gators
sometimes stroll overland a mile or two. Along
the Cape York Peninsula coast there are many
tropical lagoons a few miles inland, and old-man
’gator periodically comes out of the rivers, swims
along the coast and then strikes across for these
holes, which are swarming with big fishes, and to
the waters of which come mobs of wild pigs to
drink. I saw a great fight up in that part one
day. What looked like a big black log with ridges
down the back was floating towards us. Suddenly
i streak of foam, exactly
like the wake of a tor-
pedo, shot towards the
log. The log, heaved,
turned over sideways and
showed us the dirty,
brown-white belly of an
alligator—his most vulner-
able part. The shark s
teeth clashed on the hard,
armor-plated back. In-
stantly the ’gator’s lore',
fearfull y-strong tail
swung over his back apd
struck the water with
great force. But the
shark had darted back,
and was swimming with
amazing speed round and
round the enemy, feint-
ing in and out, watching
for a chance to snap at
the belly. The ’gator
made straight for the
shore, warily watching,
turning his scaly back to
the shark’s rushes ami
furiously lashing about
him with his great flail.
Close inshore the shark
fastened on to one of the
’gator’s hind legs, snap-
ping it clean in two. A
cyclone makes but a small
noise compared with what
that grunting ’gator did
with his tail on the now
very shallow water. And
that shallow water was
just where the shark fell
in. Pressing too eagerly
after the frantic reptile
ho stranded, and all the
fight went out of him in-
stantly. Before you could
say “Mine’s a beer” the ’gator spotted liis pursuer’s
expected trouble. Turning sharply, despite his
mangled leg, he converted his tail into a Catherine
wheel and the shark w T as knocked clean out of the
water up and down. Then the reptile got at the sea
lawyer with those horrible great jaws of his, and
what was left of that fish hardly made an evening
meal for my blackboy and his missus.

“Mookingah”: There are still some
dingoes in New South. The Milparinka P. p
Board during 1918 paid for 422 scalps at £1 per
scalp. This amount is subsidised by station-
owners up to as much as £3, and the dogger also
receives 255. per week and keep. Yet the dingo
flourishes exceedingly.

“E.S.”: The big squatter did not often
come into town, but when he did he always drove
a four-in-hand. One day he was shifting scenery
at a great pace when, on nearing the bridge he
was confronted in the middle of the road by a
terribly dirty swagman who requested him to
drive slowly over the bridge. “Why, is the bridge
unsafe?” asked the impatient nabob. “No, but me
mate s asleep underneath,” says the swaggie. Then
he jumped aside just in time to save his life.

“E.S.S.”: Names are badly wanted for the
north-eastern corner of N. S. Whales, generally
known as the Northern Rivers and North Coast
and the north-west corner, which has nothing
better to go into print with than the Trans-Darling”
or North-western Division. It was
once actually proposed to call the
' “Northern Rivers’’ New Yorkshire,
when the first notion of forming
those parts into a separate State
was sprouting, and before a mon-
strosity of that kind gets another
hearing I suggest that the names of
the old aboriginal towris in these
corners be collected and the terri-
tories mapped accordingly. Does any
Abo. know these names and the ex-
tent 0 f the towris (tribal-territories) ?
with this information we may arrive
m the vicinity of a suitable handle
or each of the nameless corners.

is one of the subjects that were such splendid
bases for wrangles in the A.I.F. A full-blast
argument with pugilistic punctuation could always

snakes; (2) Sydney v. Melbourne; (3) whether the
steamer Loongana did or did not shake the apples
off the trees in Tassie when she hit the wharf in
Launceston; and (4) is the 'roo born in the pouch

“J. J.D.” ; It's correct, as stated by “Wer-

good-conditioned wethers, will rush. Took delivery
of 18,000 six-tooth Lerida (Q.) male sheep to over-
land into New England (N.S.W.) some years ago.
The night they were camped on the boundary
(lucky for me it was one of Bananaland’s bright
moonlight nights) the babbling brook dropped his
tinware when putting it up on the tail-board of his
ration-cart after tea. The clatter set the 18,000
woollies rushing into the back of the
camp, where they jambed on to the
six-wire straight fence that formed

“kerango”: Recent mention of an im-
mense scrub-turkey’s nest on Holbourne Island, 20
miles east from Bowen (Q.) ; recalled my visit there
m 1911 searching for survivors or wreckage from
the Yongala. We discovered that the island, which
is about two miles long by about one mile wade, has
three high hills covered with tropical vegetation
abounding- with scrub-turkeys, wonga, nutmeg pigeons
and the magmficently-plumaged rifle-bird. Thousands
of seabirds congregated on the rugged north-eastern
cliffs, where large deposits of guano were found. In
the two gullies we put up scores of quail, and under-
standing that quail are not accredited with being
marathon fliers, it puzzled us somewhat how they
got there. An accidentally-started fire drove numer-
ous reptiles down to the beaches, where we de-
spatched them with large pieces of coral. Yet we
couldn’t induce any drinking water to show itself
1,1 any nook or cranny of the island. Turtles and
their nests were numerous, and the fishing excellent.
Many different species were landed. Bats, flying-
foxes and flying insects of. all kinds were observed
in untold numbers. Having, at different times,
visited scores, of islands from Moreton Bay to Torres
Stiait, Im quite satisfied that Holbourne is the near-
est approach to a nature student's paradise in eastern
Australian tropical or sub-tropical waters.

Mrs. Lance Kawson”: How far from
water can the alligator travel? Well, on one
occasion, during a big drought in the ’seventies at
Ihp Hollow (Q.), Rawson Bros.’ station at that time,
we came upon a 10-foot alligator crossing from
one of the inland lagoons to the river. When we
spotted him he was fully nine miles from the river
and fairly fat, for the lagoon was full of bogged
animals. We shepherded him for some distance, the
idea being to ride for a rifle when nearer the
homestead; but when some distance from the
house his nibs spotted us and then it was good-
-I>3e. Mi. and Mrs. Alligator make their home, as a
rule, pretty close to the water, in some secluded
Scrub, and it is not very unlike a scrub turkey's
nest. She lays her eggs in the mound and covers
them deeply with leaves, sticks, sand, etc. I
have heard it said that the male takes no part
in this work, but that is wrong so far as my
experience goes. I have watched on more than
one occasion the starting and the completion of
an alligator’s nest, and though I cannot be positive
that the boss helps to build the cradle I have seen
him assisting to “nose” the mound together,
that is to say, I have seen a pair at the work
at once. It is fortunate for those people who live
near the home of Mr. and Mrs. Alligator that the
reptiles are not averse to reducing their family by
eating them. I say it is fortunate, for. Mrs. ’Gator
lays up to 80 or 100 eggs and most of them hatch

“Dingo”: Can anyone oblige with a' tip
to prevent a cow from sucking herself?- I have
a middle-aged Jersey that has only lately taken
to the trick, and yokes, muzzles and all such con-
trivances have failed to discourage her.

pushing us hard. A Cockney crew was breaking
its neck to get its gun away, but one of the
leaders” was either half-paralyzed with fright or
else the mule strain in it was showing up. Any-
way, nothing could induce the brute to budge until
a weather-beaten, war-stained Aussie, who had some-
k»w got separated from his mates, eoollv moved up
and grabbing a fist full of France jabbed it be-
tween the nag’s teeth. The prad, whilst trying
to identify the new brand of forage, seemed to

mediately became as tractable as Mary’s lamb.

THE LAST TO LEAVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Whenever is told the gallant story
(Ho! ho! ho! and a bottle of rum!)
Of old Gallipoli’s endless glory,
The name won’t be found of the man who fell
The first of our dead on those shores of Hell;
And when from those hills the Anzacs passed
Who was the soldier who left the last?
Of his name and number is history dumb.
{Ho! lio! ho! and a bottle of rum!)
Though eager volunteers there were plenty
(■ Ho! ho! ho! and a bottle of rum!)
They chose from the veterans only twenty.
They were men of the Landing, grim and tough ;
Their job was to die in a dinkum bluff.
They were there to stave off the Turks’ attack,
And held ten thousand Abduls back,
Or go in glory to Kingdom Gome!
{Ho! ho! ho! and a bottle of rum!)
Horatios holding miles of bridges,
(Ho! ho! ho! and a bottle of rum!)
They held the Turk from the outpest ridges.
Each plaj f ed at being an army corps
For anxious hours, then streaked for the shore.
And they said with pride as out they passed,
“We were here the first, and we’ve left the last!”
Then they thought of the dead, and their hearts
went numb.
(Ho! ho! ho! and a bottle of rum!) '
And though our history proudly teaches
{Ho! ho! ho! and a bottle of rum!)
That these were the last to leave the beaches,
Another was later, though not on the list,
Mho earlier in the day was missed.
For he had make a remarkable find—
A beautiful bottle left behind ;
And he sat on the beach and he tasted some!
(Ho! ho! ho! and a bottle of rum!)
For what were orders but froth and bubbles?
( Ho! ho! ho! and a bottle of rum!)
He was due with the rest to embark. His troubles!
He said to the bottle that he would wait;
He wasn t the bloke to desert his mate!
That night this chap was the whole of the show
One man and a bottle against the foe l
And he slept at last, still clasping his’ chum! '
(Ho! ho! ho! and a bottle of rum!)
Next morn round the cove a launch came creeping
(Ho! ho! ho! and a bottle of rum!)
And there on the sands lay a soldier sleeping.
They decided to bury that Anzac brave;
When an empty bottle they saw him wave.
And his semaphoring seemed to spell
Those saddest of letters, “T.8.L.” ;
As they rescued him they heard him hum.
(Ho! ho! ho! and a bottle of rum!)
He was last to leave, but he got no glory.
{Ho! ho! ho! and a bottle of rum!)
for three days in clink was the end of his story.
But the men on the launch are ready to swear
That a curious chorus filled the air,
A, if his mates in their lone graves heard l
For borne on a breeze that strangely stirred
A ghostly chuckle seemed to come.
(Ho! ho! ho! and a bottle of rum!)

IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY.
(A Warning to Mothers.)
FIRST PIRATE: “Wottle we do to ’em, Bill—’it ’em?”
SECOND PIRATE ( scornfully ): “Na! Breathe on ’em an’ give ’em the ’ooptn’ cough.”
“D.F.” : A lot of good food is thrown away
at lamb-marking times. An old sheepowner at
Orielton (Tas.) used to see that it was not all
wasted. He would take a couple of dozen of the
lambs’ tails, throw them on a lire till they were
more or less roasted, and then eat them. Skinned and
cooked a bit more thoroughly they were at one
time a favorite dish in some parts of the Speck.

“Dugout”: Ask “Nor’-West” and “Leo
“Lear” to declare an armistice until I butt in and en-
lighten them as to the real master mason in the Aus-
tralian bird’s building trade. The swallow and
the martin are not it it when compared with that
dapper little chap the pee-wee, which is so common
in N. S. Wales and parts of Victoria. This indus-
trious Hop o’ my Thumb builds a residence weighing
about 21b. out of any old mud that’s going, and
has the knack of putting it together as firmly
as reinforced concrete. I tested the resistance of one
of these dwellings and found that good-sized stones
"would bounce off it, whereas nests built by the
swallow or the martin collapse under very little
pressure. A curious thing about the pee-wee is
that it invariably selects a thin twig on a swinging
branch as a foundation for its Spring home.

“Dr. Nil”: About “homing instincts.”
“D.F.” (B. 9/l/’l9) says cattle made back overland
when they had been deported by sea, and wants to
know if anyone can swallow the yarn. Yes, I
can swallow it as easily as I could have swallowed
the* cattle, and much more quickly. Has any
“’boliar” ever heard of the semi-circular canals of
the internal ear? If not there is always the “En-
cyclopaedia Britannica” in the Public Library. These
minute but not microscopic channels, through the
ivory-like bone which contains the hearing appara-
tus, have no openings to the exterior of the body.
They are six in number, three on either side of the
head, and so arranged that no matter in' what plane
any diameter of the head is placed, one or other of
the six is sure to be almost if not quite horizontal.
The three canals forming each group, right and left,
meet at both ends at a common point. If you take
a cubical box and draw three semi-circles, or three-
quarter circles, on three adjacent sides, meeting at
a common corner, you will see the idea. If, now,
you imagine these two groups of three so placed in
the temporal bones (those containing the hearing
outfit) that their respective “common corners” point
towards each other across the base of the skull, you
will have a fair notion of the scheme. Now these
tubes are filled with fluid, and when the head is
turned in any direction, in any plane, the fluid in the
canal most nearly approximate to that plane slips,
like water in a glass which you rotate in your
fingers. This impression is conveyed to the brain
by special nerve-ends, and, I venture to think, is
subconsciously registered there. Now, has any other
’liar heard of a surveyor’s “traverse” —how he goes
out into wild and trackless land, and with his theo-
dolyte and compass (both represented by semi-circu-
lar canals) works round an unexplored area of dense
scrub and comes back to the spot he started from in
the opposite direction? If not, ask any surveyor
about it. It is a simple matter of keeping count of
how much north, how much east, how much south
and then how much west is required to make up the
equation. In animals and most savages and in my-
self, it is a subconscious, or unconscious, orientation,
which has no dependence on visual or any other
sense of conscious observation. That is why carrier-
pigeons are carried in dark boxes to be liberated
for their homing flight, and also why the cat came
back. When I came out to Australia as a youth from
London my companions used to try to lose me in
the bush—real good old-fashioned bush with heavy
timber and bewildering mountains and scrubs and
few roads and fewer fences. I soon found that if
after half a day’s riding about they said, “Now, then
where’s Coonabarabran?” I had no need to think.
I could always point to where I started from. Of
course that’s' nothing to skite about. But let me
say that when homing-pigeons have their semi-circu-
lar canals damaged, they cannot “home” any more.
So I think I must be right.
*•**-*
“Eddyson” : John Robson had not regarded
the expected arrival of his baby with any particular
concern. He had never been mixed up with
babies. He was a very ordinary, bush-bred man
who quite realised the essentials of a horse and
a dog, but a baby was an unknown item. At its
birth, however, he took the child in his two
large hands, gazed upon it, and suddenly the
important interests of his life faded into insignifi-
cance. Next days Wells found Robson, stripped
almost to the bone, whirling an axe in the
timber adjacent to his home, felling trees as if
they had been twigs. “That kid ’il be walkin’
soon,” said Robson—“s’pose a limb fell on him!”
Next he broke all records slab-fencing his domain.
“Suppose that kid strayed into the creek!” he
said. (The kid was not vet two months old and
the creek was half a mile away.) Robson, who
had been wont to spend two-thirds of the year
away shearing, stayed at home and slaved on
his selection, till it literally jumped out of the
wilderness, a little Eden, blooming like a rose.
“Suppose that kid’s gotter be thought of!” said
John. Father could hardly be induced to venture
a mile from his home. “Suppose somethin’ hap-
pened!” he said. John’s wife was almost as zealous
in her. care of John junior, but John senior was
never quite satisfied with anything unless it was
done right under his own eye. He devised a con-
trivance like that in which an Indian squaw carries
her papoose, and took the infant into the bush
with him, and hung him to the shady side of
a tree butt. “A man can work better with the
kid lookin’ on,” he explained. When the baby
was 19 months old he developed a little eye-
trouble necessitating a minor operation. Robson
had his farm to handle and could not go with
Mrs. Robson to Melbourne. On the second day
after her departure news of a great fire in the
city reached Bathbrook. Robson heard it at
Keith’s store in the t(4wnship. “Supposin’,” he
mused. “Supposin’!” Wide-eyed he broke through
the little circle of men, and started off down tne
road. The party watched him rush up and over
Monday’s Hump. “So ’elp me, if he ain’t runnin’
to Melbourne!” ejaculated Keith. What else could
Robson do?—there was no train down till next
morning at 10. But Melbourne was 109 miles
off. Mrs. Robson returned with her boy that
afternoon. At about the same time Robson arrived
in the metropolis on a staggering horse. The
nag, a fine bay, died, and within 20 minutes
the police, apprised of the theft by wire, had
John on a charge of horse-stealing. Robson had
knocked a man on the head 14 miles from
Bathbrook, and "borrowed” his horse. His story
sounded most fantastical and he got two years
hard. To an unemotional judge and a jury with
commonplace ideas about babes there was nothing
but blatant imbecility in the prisoner’s insistent
plea: “Suppose if the whole town had been burned
down! Supposin’ all Melbourne had gonel”
Courts of justice are not supposed to suppose.

“Paul Cupid” : This is what I want to
know: why is the rabbit the most abstemious
inhabitant of Australia? He can live without water.
Here in the drought-stricken districts of N. S.
Wales the pest is as frisky as ever, though he is
miles away from a pub. No use any Abo. scribe
speaking out of his turn to say that bunny visits
the troughs fed by windmills in his neighborhood.
He doesn’t. Seems when drought comes his wife
swears off increasing the species, and he swears off
drink of any kind. As I write I can hear .a
small dog under the house ineffectually endeavor-
ing to get more closely acquainted with a rabbit.
The house is surrounded by a garden (that was)
enclosed by a sft. netted fence. A month ago a
cotton-tail got in somehow, has remained in, has
had no possibility of. quenching his thirst if he
ever had one, an.d is in pfrime condition. I’m
going to arrange to have him left alone just to
see how long he can survive without breaking the
pledge.
* * * *
“Alcheringa”: The presence of black
cockatoos as a sign of approaching rain was
recently mentioned by “Melos.” The white man
has borrowed this superstition from the inland
blacks. Binghi (or certain tribes of him, like
the Aruntas) has always associated the black cocky
with a prospective fall of moisture. In dry seasons
rain-making ceremonies were performed, and part
of the principal artist’s make-up was a bunch of
the bird's tail-feathers held in each hand. The
great ancestral rain-maker was Irria, and this
gentleman always adorned himself with the plumage
of the black cockatoo while performing his rites.
So far the white man has not found a better
scheme.
“Veronal” ; Know the death’s-head moth?
I’ve found this insect only once—in a close
to the sea on the South Coast (N.S.W.). It is cream-
colored and black, and has the skull and cross-
bones plainly defined in the latter color on its
forehead. Froggatt doesn’t even mention it in
his “Insects of Australia,” hence I reckon that it’s
a rare variety. Another small moth fairly common
in South Coast scrubs is a rich claret-color edged
with purple-black. I have also occasionally found
the giant grey moth (it may run to five inches in
length) in that quarter, but always either dead
or in a dying state. This insect passes most of
its existence' as a grub in dead timber, and dies
soon after it emerges as a moth. It has just time
for a courtship and a brief honeymoon, and then
dies, first, if a female, laying its eggs. The
aboriginals ate this moth, as they did the Bugong
variety, but being comparatively scarce it couldn’t
have been an important item in the tucker supply.
* * * *
“Scotty”: Tell “Border Fence” (B.
26/12/’18) that 220 z. of grease from a gohanna
is hardly worth mentioning. Saw a drover in the
west (N.S.W.) slay an old man go’, and boil the
gall down. The result was a billycan full of
pure oil weighing approximately 40oz. Even then
the drover growled. For keeping saddles, harness
and all leather goods in first-class order this oil
lubricates alone.
BEAUTY UNADORNED.
BLOSSOM: “What a grimly determined, pugnacious looking and masterful man Major
Fitzdoodle is!”

Currants, Sultanas, Lexias,
“Raisins Raised by The Rays of The Southern Sun,’’
by A.D.F.A. (Australian Dried Fruits Association.)
TO THE PUBLIC OF AUSTRALIA—
I guarantee to release throughout Australia, through
most of the Daily Papers of the Capital Cities, on
SATURDAY, 29th March, 1919, one of the Most Novel
and Attractive Publicity “STUNTS” ever placed before you.
I further guarantee that all men, women and children
will have the chance of tasting SUN-RAYSED currants,
Sultanas, Lexias, under conditions that none of them will
be able to resist.
I cannot release this plan before the 29th March
because there would not be enough fruit to meet the demand
until the New Season’s SUN-RAYSED fruits are harvested
in February and March, 1919.
The whole of Australia will get the “SUN-RAYSED”
Habit.
GROCERS - Get in your Stocks of SUN-RAYSED
Currants, Sultanas, and Lexias before 29th March.
YOU’LL NEED THEM, and if you have not got
you will miss valuable business.
EVERYBODY ELSE—GET THE “SUN-RAYSED”
HABIT NOW. You will find it will help you considerably
after 29th March.

A Satchel of Books
On the Knees of the Gods, by Mabel Baleombe
Brookes (Melville and Mullen Pty. Ltd., Melbourne).
A war novel with plenty of interest from the
feminine side and some from the male. There is
a good Australian flavor, though the authoress does
on occasion call her people “colonials.” The
Melbourne publishers have done their work well
and the book is lavishly illustrated.
“Salty,” by J. H. M. Abbott (N.S.W. Book-
stall Co., Sydney). This book is worthy a better
presentation than in paper covers, though the
Norman Lindsay picture on the front takes away
all cheapness of actual appearance. Abbott has
made a special study of early times in N. S. Wales;
and the story goes convincingly and holds the
interest. There is plenty of incident; and historical
figures, like those of Macquarie and Samuel Marsden,
jostle with imaginary people painted in the colors
of the rather bitter time. The “Battle of Prospect
Hill” supplies a vivid chapter.
The Kaiser I Knew, by Arthur N. Davis
(Hodder and Stoughton, London). Davis, an
American, was dentist to the wild person who has
destroyed Germany. You get here a pretty close
picture of him; and learn that his moustache
doesn’t turn up as much as the cartoonist pretends,
that his sft. lOin. weighed 1751 b. when the nest
of Germany was getting painfully thin, that he
continued to speak English even at military head-
quarters after America threw down the gauntlet,
and that he suggested the likelihood of Germany
having to assist France to get the British out of
that courtry. The book is simple and direct, and
should maintain its interest for some weeks longer.
The Sword of the Spirit, by Joseph Fort Newton
(Nisbet and C'o., London). The author is an
American who now preaches in the City Temple,
London, where Joseph Parker held the fort for
30 years. Judged by this book, he has none
of Parker’s poetry and less of his daring; but as
an interpreter of the American spirit to England
in war-time he appears to have his uses.
Psychism, Glastonbury and “The Month,” by Paul
Hookham (B. 11. Blackwell, Oxford). Is there in
nature a universal memory? Through a maze of
flat words the reader gets the idea that somebody
may be trying to find an answer to a question like
this. All the author has to say could have been
put in a dozen crisp sentences. A very solemn
Oxford bleat resow ds through the dull ineffective-
ness of it all
Boundary Riders of Egypt, by Lieut. H. Bowden
Fletcher (Australasian Authors’ Agency, Melbourne).
When the Australian Light Horse followed the
track of Moses, Tirhaka and Napoleon across the
desert road from Africa to Asia Fletcher was with
them. This little book, written with sympathy
and knowledge, tells of their mode of life. As
good as most war stories and a lot better than
some.
The Glory of the Trenches, by Coningsby Dawson
(.John Lane, London). Here the author presses a
curious religious aspect of the fighting which he
< laims to be the general view of the Tommies at
the front. The book is so well written that it
must have stirred English hearts.
Escaped, or Adventures in German Captivity, by
Wallace Ellison. It was published while the war
was still going strong, so the writer couldn’t describe
in full the six holes he found in the Hun arrange-
ments lest the Hun should plug them up against
other escapees. The names of the "people who
helped had -to be mostly suppressed, too ; likewise the
things they said and did. Even the routes followed
are not mapped out clearly. If a route led
into Schmidt's front door and out at the back, a
map of it might have cut short Schmidt’s useful
life. The Huns were beastly uncivil after one or
two of Wallace Ellison’s attempts to escape, yet they
were not so uncivil as they might have been. They
acted like the pedigree hog which has taken a prize
at the show rather than the wild one of mixed
coloring and parentage and no shape worth mention-
ing. (William Blackwood and Son.)
Who Was St. George of Merrie Englandf by
Robert Chandler (Gordon and Gotch, Brisbane). A
pamphlet full of information from ancient sources
about the very truculent early Christian of Palestine
and Asia Minor who was adopted as the patron
saint of the Anglo-Norman. He wasn’t particularly
English; but one saint is as good as another when
it comes to holding a banquet in his honor.
The Inky Way
“8.T.”: I have just heard the keeper of
a lending library boast that one Australian
book in her stock has passed through the
hands of 200 clients. At 3d. a time. So the
librarian has received £2 10s. for a book
for which she had given perhaps two-and-six,
and which she will presently sell, second-
hand, at something about the price she paid
for it. The author meanwhile is to con-
sider himself a lucky man if his share of
that particular volume was 2d. And the
high price of everything else appertaining
to a book except the author thereof is
driving readers more and more to the
alternative of hiring a book for 3d. rather
than buying it for 6s. Since our numerous
legislators can do nothing for the Austra-
lian writer, why not have a poor-box set
up in each of these hire-system bookshops,
with the legend “For the Poor Author!”
and request readers of their charity to spare
one penny for the misfortunate author?
Mark Smith, English printer, inventor of
the “stop press” device allowing of a late
drop-in, has gone on to the Great Proof-
reader.
“0.K.”: Most people who enjoyed the
pungent humor of lan Hay in “The Oppressed
English” fancied, I think, that his literary
talent had been born with the war and
come to light with “The First Hundred
Thousand.” But in the opening number
of the “Odd Volume,” issued by the British
Nat. Book Trade Provident Society as a
Charity Annual in 1911, there is a playlet
in three episodes by the subsequent author
of “The First Hundred Thousand.” It is
a good-hearted thing with something of
Bernard Shaw’s brightness in its flippancy.
The title is “Personally, or by Letter,” and
a footnote refers would-be producers of the
playlet to the author, at Fettes College,
Edinburgh. Evidently lan Hay didn’t need
the war to bring him into notice.
The American fiction-writer cusses in the
boudoir now. In the Ladies’ Home Journal
for November a story for women is lit up
with: “Let me tell you that cold sea water
soon got bloody hot.” The ladies’ homely
adjective explodes again in the same yarn,
and there’s more ruddiness further on.
The new volume of the Dublin Review
has something fresh about O’Connell. He
attributed his eloquence and imagination
to his wonderful little grandmother, known
as Dark Mary. She lived to 90, and had
22 children, 10 of whom also scored 90
apiece. She was a great smuggler, held to
be an honorable profession at that time. At
Darrynane, the O’Connell estate, there is an
underground passage leading to the sea. Up
it came tea, brandy, claret, sugar, tobacco,
etc. Down it went butter, salt fish, hides
and so forth.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“D.”: The vessel now on the stocks at
Battery Point, Hobart, for Jones and Co.,
will be the largest vessel yet built in the
Speck. She will be between 600 and 700
tons; the previous biggest was probably the
barque Loongana, of about 500 tons, built
in 1879 and wrecked in the South Seas a
few years ago. At Tort Cygnet the Wilsons
still continue the 40-year-old business of
shipbuilding and have just finished a 120-ton
schooner for the inter-State trade.
“H. 0.”: A large Southern store has lately
established a “Complaints Department.” The
staff consists of one pale, thin young man,
and his duty is to get sacked. The scheme
is made possible by the fact that one shop-
assistant is even more like all others than
a musical-comedy actress is like her sisters.
When an angry customer alleges that the
silk she bought broke in halves the first
time she put it in hot water, or that the
lamp-shade was unfit to wear, the Complaints
Department is sent for by the manager and
asked how it dared endanger the firm’s repu-
tation by selling such an article. Some-
times the department looks so pathetically
like a person with a hard-working child and
several consumptive wives that the wrath of
the customer subsides. If it does not, the
department is told to put on its hat and go.
Sometimes it goes four or five times a day,
but it always comes back, and it draws its
screw with the regularity of a civil servant.
“0.L.”: The rabbit problem is being
solved all over again by the Vie. Govern-
ment. February 10 has beeu set apart by
the Executive Council as Black Monday for
bunny, and a proclamation has been issued
under the Vermin Destruction Act to this
effect. All owners and occupiers of land
throughout the State are to poison the rab-
bits on their holdings on that date. If any
occupiers can be shown to have failed to lay
strychnine on the appointed day they will
be suitably dealt with. Their local J’s.P.,
who in many cases will be rabbit-stricken
landholders, and therefore alive to the diffi-
culties of poisoning-off, will fine them one
dollar; in a few instances the non-poisoners
may even be swatted for 7s. 6d. It is a
great scheme, and should account for per-
haps one-fiftieth of the rabbits now grazing
on private lands. The rest will just go
on living their care-free life, pending tue
time when wire-netting is available in large
quantities at £25 a ton, and the authorities
decide to coax the rabbit-trapper back to his
old job by treating him as the important
person that he really is.
* * * *
“M.C.T.” : Arthur R.” (B. 9/1/T9) didn’t
do a friendly thing to our returned Billjims
when he recommended them to take on
eucalyptus distilling. The initial cost may
not be large (an axe, long-handled knife and
tucker-bag comprise the necessary outfit) ;
but the work is hard, the hours long, and
the remuneration rotten. A first-class hush-
man, working from 10 to 14 hours a day,
may earn 10s. when all the conditions are
favorable. I know a couple of returned
soldiers who came to the Braidwood district
from Sydney and who earned 4s. 6d. a week
each the first fortnight cutting leaves. They
left after the third week’s graft when the
boss handed them out 9s. each, the price of
two tanks of leaves. The Labor Bureau
recommended the job, presumably because,
like “Arthur R.,” it knew nothing about it.
* * * *
“Edo”: “11.N.C.5.” (B. 2/1/T8) is
meanly inaccurate about the price paid at
Kalgoorlie for soldier-made axe-handles cut
from native needlewood. The object of my
par. was to show how the imported article
was given preference. On the date I wrote
(about November 1), tool-handles were very
scarce on Golden Mile and the woodline
which supplies fuel to the mines. The re-
turned men’s products were charged for just
like the imported things—3s. 6d. to ss. per
axe-handle, for instance. But the retailers
gave the soldiers only Is. for each article.
The moment the armistice was proclaimed
the market was flooded with held-up im-
ported stock, and then, but not till then, did
the local traders sell the soldiers’ goods at
2s. 6d. or less.

“Silas”: I heard Aarons complain with
deepest emotion, “The vater-pibe eet burst
und dere vos der vater skvirt in py mein
vintow und toor, making der ruin mit mein
sdock. I run to vere der turncock he liff —
der stop-vater feller —und I say to beem:
‘Come kvick—kvick! Turn off der vater in
our sdreed!’ Und he look ad me, und he
say so calm : ‘Vot, Ikey, vos you ospectingk a
fire?’ ”
THE MIND’S WAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Strange the thoughts that the mind will choose,
Bitter and sweet, as one reclines
Musing at night, as now I muse—■
Moonlight and music, under the pines.
Gold is good for the things it buys,
Yet gold will buy not the things I crave—
Youth and beauty and sparkling eyes,
Love and laughter and joyance brave.
Silks and satins are all the rage,
Gossamer wares of the finest mesh.
Who shall garment the bones of Age,
Robe them anew in rosy flesh ?
Light-o’-love sells for a piece of gold
Kisses, lacking in warmth and joy—•
Where’s the market where love is sold
Fresh from the heart of girl and boy?
Strange the thoughts that the mind will choose,
Bitter and sweet, as one reclines,
.Musing at night as now I muse—•
Moonlight and music, under the pines.

The LARGEST TRANSFORMER
u- : ;

.
'T'HIS two-to-one three-phase auto transformer now
* in service at the Connors CreeK Station ojf the
Detroit Edison Company is rated at
50,000 Kv-a,
with an efficiency o/ over 99 per cent.
To give the maximum strength demanded by the
transformer’s unusual dimensions the G-E circular
coil principle was used. Special framework holds
the coils rigid in case short circuits with their
tremendous forces are encountered. These forces
under certain conditions may rise to a maximum
value of 300,000 pounds.
THe core is of such size that special ventilation facilities were provided for.
This transformer sets a new record for transformer capacity in a single unit.

MAGNESIA FOR DYSPEPTICS.
SPECIALIST RECOMMENDS IT
INSTEAD OF DRUGS.
“Only those in constant touch with suf-
ferers from indigestion and dyspepsia can
fully realise the harm done by the improper
use of drugs and artificial digestants, re-
marked an eminent specialist recently.
“Personally I rarely advocate the use or
drugs in the treatment of digestive or
stomach troubles, for in practically every
instance I have proved the underlying cause
to be excessive acidity of the stomach and
consequent fermentation of the food con-
tents. Therefore, in place of the once
widely-used drugs I invariably recommend
the use of magnesia to neutralise the acidit>
and stop the food fermenting, and the excel-
lent results I have obtained during the past
three years convince me that there is no
finer treatment for indigestion, dyspepsia,
etc., etc. It must, of course, be clearlj
understood that I do not employ or advise
the use of such forms of magnesia as
citrates, acetates, sulphates, etc.—tnest
would often do more harm than good; noth-
ing but bisurated magnesia—the form pie-
scribed by physicians—-should ever. be us
to neutralise stomach acids. This is Ret-
ail difficult to obtain—in fact, I nna tnat
most chemists now stock the preparatio
tablet form in addition to the ordinary
powder. Half a teaspoonful bisurated
magnesia in powder form or two
pressed tablets will usually be foun Ufi
sufficient to instantly neutralise the •
and prevent food fermentation, theie y
suring painless, natural digestion tor
chronic sufferers.” — advt.
POVERTY
POINT
They did it even in 1665, during the Great
Plague in London. Defoe records:
All the plays and interludes which had been
set up among us were forbid to act; the gaming
tables, public dancing rooms, and music houses
were shut up.
“0. Ockney”: “Fax” on the late Charles
Wyndham (B. 23/1/T9) strikes me as be-
ing somewhat ungenerous to a fine artist.
“He never was identified with great produc-
tions or great performances,” asserted “Fax.”
Well, it all depends on how you apply the
much misused adjective. Putting aside the
frivolous farces that first brought him into
prominence, I think the thanks of playgoers
all over the world are due to Wyndham for
staging, say, the delightful series of Henry
Arthur Jones comedies, including “The
Liars,” “The Case of Kebellious Susan,”
“The Physician,” and “Mrs. Dane’s De
fence.” Then there were “The Mollusc,”
“Mrs. Gorringe’s' Necklace” and “Captain
Drew on Leave,” of Hubert Henry Davies.
And what about the wonderfully successful
version of “David Garrick” and the
ambitious English adaptation of “Cyrano de
Bergerac”? These may not have been
“great.” But to me—and I witnessed them
all—they were infinitely greater than any-
thing to be seen nowadays.
Corporal John S. Sullivan, who has had
a bar added to his Military Medal, is a
grandson of Barry Sullivan, the famous
tragedian, who was in Australia in the
'sixties of last century. Amory Sullivan, of
Paddington (N.S.W.), father of the corporal
—and of two other Diggers who have been
killed and two more who have been invalided
home—was manager for his father in Aus-
tralia.
“Melb”: Operatic entrepreneur Rigo, the
Lyster of to-day, began, like Musgrove and
the senior Tait, with such work as selling
opera books. He was thus employed in New
York. Returning there after many years,
he was stage-manager at the Metropolitan.
ID first met his present conductor, Slapoff-
ski, when callboy at the London Opera. Slap
was sawing a violin in the orchestra. Rigo was
cahboy for Patti, at the Covent Garden, and
remained there till the Harris regime. Harris
made him assistant stage-manager. He
removed, in that capacity, to the New York
Metropolitan, with Abbey and Grau. Here
he was associated with Caruso and a string
of stars. Melba went to New York, and
engaged him as her producer in Australia.
After this he was back again in New York.
He came to Australia for the second time
with Genee. Yet again America was his
home, and he was with the famous Boston
Opera Co., which gave inspiration to Quin-
lan. He managed Melba’s United States
concert tour. The bad time of the War
found him once more in Australia, seeking
for undiscovered stars. And found ’em.
“8.T.”: I see it has been denied that
Paderewski, pianist and Polish patriot, was
recently fired at by a revolutionist of another
complexion, or with dissimilar hair; but if
it were true the experience would not be
new to “Paddy.” On one occasion, when he
was playing in a Chicago theatre, a musician,
leader of a local orchestra, who had recently
gone mentally “up and over,” and was now
under the delusion that the shock-headed 1 ole
had embezzled all his musical ability, pulled
a “gun,” and started sniping the strange bird
at the piano. After five shots the maniac
was grabbed, and presently, when the audi-
ence had sobered down, it interrupted Lnsiu s
playing with storms of applause. Through-
out" the shooting Paderewski had not turned
a hair, but had gone on playing his step-
dance from Beethoven precisely as if nothing,
out of the ordinary was happening. V\then
all was over Pad. said to his agent: Put
for why der great applause?” “For your
coolness, sir,” the agent replied My-cool.
But why for not?” “Great snakes, a fellow
was shooting at you!" “Mein Gott. and
'Effski fainted. It was the first he d heard
of it.
“Chev’s” view T of it: —
Ted Colies (B. 23$L/T9) seems to have missed
Geo. Robey while doing the halls. Not the least of
Robey’s assets is liis;.,facial expression; his trick
of “lifting” his heavily blacked eyebrows and assum-
ing a look of inquiring surprise at the laughs
he creates, coupled with his sibilant “Cease!” or
“Desist!” makes the crowd rock. Colies couples
Geo. Graves with Will Evans as “about the best
exponents of low comedy stuff.” But the unctuous
humor of Graves is far richer than anything Evans
has done. Little Tich will never put on the big
boots again; it was killing work, anyway, and he
told me years ago that he had “put them among the
curios for ever.” I wonder Colles did not see Fred
Kitchen, one of the few realty-natural great
comedians; and I would have liked his opinion of
Bransby Williams, to my mind one of the greatest
men on the music-hall stage: his impersonations were
always wonderful, especially his Lloyd George,
though it is as a character-actor (particularly
Dickens characters) that he will be remembered.
“75” : Gone west from Melbourne, in her
76th year, the widow of conductor Julius
Herz. With Frederick Cowen, Julius shared
the conductor’s chair at the festival held in
connection with the Melbourne Exhibition in
1887, at which Mrs. Herz was one of the
leading soloists. Governor William Robin-
son, who dabbled in music in the intervals
of acting as crimson link between John
Bull and various States, had a great admira-
tion for the lady’s talents, and several of his
own songs, notably the bathetic “Remember
Me No More,” were sung for the first time
in public by Mrs. Herz. Her son, Corporal
Larry, lately returned from the front after
two years’ service.
If some of the picture stars don’t stop
fussing about their moneybags, the Bol-
sheviks will stop chasing kings and go after
the Chaplins and Pickfords. In a recent
action brought against her in the U.S.
Supreme Court by her alleged agent, little
Mary’s income for two years was said to
have been £276,000.
ONE OF THE “DAME'S” FOLLOWERS.
FIRSR PANTO. TART ( flattered ): “Who’s
that old beast in the stage box —got St.
Vitus of the eye?”
SECOND PANTO. TART ( poisonously) : “As
blind as a bat, m’ dear. Saw him trying
to mash Barry Lupino the other night!”
“Jeune Premier”: The English Actors’
Association has cut its “dignity” and given
a little more power to its elbow. In short,
it has become a Trades Union. The highest
and lowest-salaried mummers have fallen
into line: members were practically unani-
mous, the voting being: For, 1191; against,
15 g 0 Art will henceforth have to do the
best it can side by side with Justice and
Equity.
“Glen”: Mrs. Pat Campbell and Ethel
Warwick —she who in the Australian pro-
duction of Parker’s “Joseph and Mis
Brethren” gave us a Mrs. Potipliar who
appeared to be suffering from the hot. un-
ruly passion of a middle-aged polar bear
have both taken to vaudeville. Mrs. Pat is
presenting a sketch written by her recently-
acquired husband, George Cornwallis-West,
and the Warwick dady a playlet by Hartley
Manners, author of “Peg o’ My Heart.”
THE WORM TURNS.
BEAUTY AVTOR : “Really y' know it's too
much. What with, rehearsals and
matinees and the stage-manager's dread-
ful language it’s enough to make a chap
turn Bolshevik.”
“Stargazer”: The old pro. told bis panto-
mime story. “We were glad to take on any-
thing in those days, and one Christmas I
found myself giving my marvellous imper-
sonation of an -ostrich, a moa, or some
chicken of the kind in ‘Sinbad the Sailor.’
My head was buried in the dark depths of
the strange wild fowl, and my view of the
outer world was confined to a strip of gauze
in the craw of the ungainly hen. This peep-
hole was obscured by the unwonted ruffling
of my plumage after a comic barnyard scrap
on tlie fifth night, and I found myself some-
where down stage, blindfolded, and totally
unaware of the direction of the exit. 1
tripped over the footlights and pitched
into the orchestra, diving straight into one
of the cauldron drums. Floundering round to
regain my feet I fetched the already dis-
gusted drummer a smart bat _on the jaw
with my claw, at which he, being a comba-
tive person and Irish into the bargain, lost
all discretion and went for the misfortunate
ostrich. Well, we put up a lively fight,
and the audience, imagining it was part
of the fun of the night, roared delighted
approval right through the tumultuous con-
test, which lasted till a herculean assistant
stage-manager dragged the homicidal African
canary clinging desperately to his prey bodily
through the wicket. Next morning I had
to see the management. I knew what to
expect, and went to get it with what con-
trition I was capable of. Ryan, the drum-
mer. was there before me, looking very dis-
consolate. ‘Damfine exhibition you made of
yourselves last night, must say!’ snorted
Carter. ‘Here, what are you drawing?’
‘Thirty shillings,’ said I. The drummer’s
pay was the same. ‘Well,’ said Carter, ‘it’s
three pounds per week apiece if you can
repeat that act. It’s the funniest damthing
I’ve ever seen.’ That was the be-
ginning of my association with Ryan. We
ran our ostrich and drummer turn in the
halls for five years, and initiated, I think,
the off-stage business now so popular in
vaudeville and revue.”
“E.T.”: There is one American play-
wright who is collecting some pretty big
money in author’s fees in London at the
present moment. This is Avery ILopwood,
who has two pieces running there —“Fair
and Warmer” and “Roxana.” Both these
farce-comedies were staged by the William-
son firm in Australia long before tlmy were
seen in England. “Roxana” is Muriel
Starr’s reliable “Nobody’s Widow” re-
christened.
“Leicester Square”: I read that George
Robey, of the English ’alls, has been made a
Commander of the Empire. Something
wrong somewhere. The Bing Boy is more
identified with the Alhambra across the way.
“I< ax”: Barry Lupino is an unusually
efficient dame in panto, insofar that he can
make up equally well as an old woman and
a young one. He does both in “Jack and
Jill.” and gets the effect of naturalness in
either case. Disguised as a comely spinister
one would guess his age at 25, or less.
From New York :
Andrew Higginson has just finished a season
here and is ofi to London. O. P. Heggie has been
showing in New York, too, and Amy Castles and
sitters Dolly and Eileen are making enough to
buy a Blue Point now and then. Eileen is on
Gilbert and Sullivan operas at a New York house,
and doing quite well.
After running twice a day for a year to
full houses at the London Oxford, the
Bairnsfather jerry-built comedy, composed
of the sayings and doings of Old Bill in
“The Better ’Ole,” came to a sudden end
with the armistice. Another Bairnsfather
production on similar lines was promised
but abandoned.
Glass, who invented Potash and Perl-
mutter, has varied the vein a trifle in
“Why Worry?” New York Jew audiences
welcomed the fun made at their own ex-
pense, though the critics complain that the
interest is mainly feminine, and somehow,
the gallants add, it isn’t so easy to laugh
at a woman as at a man.
“The Lamb” : I'm on a job at the King’s
in Russell Street, where Ellen Terry was
playing “Faust.” All the tabbies are
standin’ round the door, eatin’ chocolate
and puttin’ violet powder on their dials,
waitin’ to see the actors and actresses come
out the stage door. I’m lit up in style—
good job, and good clobber. I looks at one
diner an’ she says, “Was that you playin’
the piano so beautiful? 5 ’ I says, “Yes, oh
yes. Would yer like me ter play yer some
more?” “Oh, do!” she gushes. I buzz in
the door, ’round the scenes and out the
back and into Phil. Stewart’s pub on the
other side of the lane. I put a tray in the
patent pianola and let ’er rip. Before the
music was finished I sank a pot or two, and
then slid back the way I came. “Did yer
like that?” I says. “Oh, it was ’eavenly !”
she gurgles ; “ ’ow clever you are!” Then
some silly goes an’ puts another tray
in the machine an’ off she goes again. After
the look the tabby gave me I didn’t wait
to make a date.
“Louis”: The school scene in “Eyes pf
Youth” recalls in a way that of “Nicholas
Nickleby.” Edward Stirling, one of the
many scissors-and-paste dramatists of the
Victorian era, relates a curious experience
with his version at Worthing (Eng.). He
could not get children for the school scene,
as Worthing was a wowser town. How-
ever, the local barber said to Stirling,
“Never fear, sir; I’ll get you 50.” He was
as good as his oath. Figaro was a player
on the French horn in his spare moments,
and going into the side streets he lured the
children by means of the instrument into
the theatre yard. Once there he closed the
gates. Amidst crying and moaning they
were placed on the stage, sitting on benches,
and kept in order by Squeers’s cane. When
the treacle was administered most of them
wailed. delighted the audience, who
thought it very natural —as indeed it was.
At nine o’clock, the act over, the barber
threw open the gate, driving his flock out
with a pleasant reminder of what they
would catch when they got home. Parents
and relatives had been scouring the town
for the runaways; and the police were com-
pletely puzzled at such wholesale kidnap-
ping. Figaro was nearly torn to pieces when
the truth was discovered.
ON THE POINT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Said the youth to the mummer: “I yearn for the
power
And the glamor that acting affords;
I> m a-thirst to be strutting and fretting my hour
On the boards.”
The ancient tragedian smothered a sigh;
“It were better your thirst to assuage
With a pick and a No. 3 shovel, than try
On the stage.
“The stage has its seasons of famine and drought,
When there isn't the hope of a shop,
And hundreds go under for one who comes out
On the top.
“Yes, laddie, much better the man with the hoe,
With a reaper and binder to hand;
Take a tip, shun the lure of the limelight, and go
On the land.
“The actor must ‘rest’ till he’s shabby and thin,
Till lie’s moscowed his ultimate rag; .
I wonder at times that he’s never run in
On the vag!”
The old mummer groaned: ou take it from me
On this you may gamble your socks,
Seme time or other each Thespian must be
On the rocks.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Great George Dubois for long enough
Had played for managements
Which vended cheap dramatic stuff—•
Recurring dull events
That gave the crowd small chance to see
An artist’s sterling quality.
’Twas thus that Dubois spoke when blown
With lust for enterprise.
He’d formed a company of his own,
And drama great and wise
He’d give to men possessed of souls,
Himself in all the leading roles.
He went away to play “King Lear.”
“How fared Dubois the bold ?”
I asked Jim Osborne in a year.
“And could he really hold
His audience in that far land?”
“He could,” James answered, “with one hand!”

we shall succeed. For ourselves, we are satisfied with a big turnover on a tiny margin of profit.
Remember that the farmer cannot do without this universal line. He must —to treat his cattle well —give them
a daily ration of Salt Lick. The intense heat of Australia must be counteracted by health-giving Salt Licks.
THE PP-TO-DATE FARMER IS WELL AWARE OF THIS.
Sheep, cows, calves, poddies, horses and pigs must be fed with Salt Licks if the farmer wishes to reap the full
advantage from his animals.
We manufacture in Australia the Best Salt Lick obtainable.
They are distributed in handy troughs to prevent wastage.
We manufacture in full knowledge of climatic conditions.
The price is less than that of imported licks by at least 25 to 30 per cent. '

For 20 years it was the Federal Land, Build-
ing and Investment Society, but in 1008,
after reconstruction, the new signboard was
hung out. There has always been something
puzzling about its financing. Take the 1911
balance-sheet, for instance. The manage-
ment had £105,115 of deposits and, on the
other sale, showed that it had itself put
£47,070 into fixtfd deposits and had £924S in
cash and on current account, with £9340 in
more or less gilfi-edged investments. Seeing
that it was highly improbable that the co.
could get the use of outside money at a
cheaper rate than the banks offered, it was
difficult to understand how the management
could show any profit on at leasft £56,000-
odd. Now look at the latest balance-sheet
figures:—
1915. 1917. 1918.

Deposits, etc. . . 59,552 56,336 54,946
During the year £89,345 of new deposits
(net) have been got in, and advances have
increased by £32,903, while cash on deposit
and* in hand has decreased by £1440. This
seems to indicate that the management, hav-
ing decided that the future is all right, has
lashed out and put the big wad of new
deposits and some of the old into profitable
lines. More likely, however, the increase
in advances, etc., is chiefly due to accommoda-
tions made to customers to take up War
Loan, while a lot of the increase in the
deposits represents Commonwealth Bank
advances to help the co. rope in subscribers.
Anyhow, it doesn’t matter much if a lot
of the outside money has been earning next
to nothing. Possibly the co. has been getting
in deposits with the hope that they could be
put into safe and profitable investments, but
has decided that conditions are too uncer-
tain. What does matter is the security
which the co. offers to its depositors;
and from that point of view there is no
cause for concern. All liabilities apart from
shareholders’ funds amount to £147,612;
and all but £71,206 of that is represented by
more or less liquid assets. To meet that
£71,206 there are loans and advances total-
ling £120,471, premises with a book value
of £ll,BOO, and odds and ends amounting to
£1237. And since the co. is in a position to
launch out on a bigger scale when the
future looks more assured, shareholders
should also do well.

This co. reconstructed in 1912, capital being
written down ss. per share so that some
goodwill froth might be blown away. The
figures above show in two ways how things
have moved since. Heavy overhead charges
are the chief trouble nowadays; £354S of
the £4321 gross profits on last half-year’s
trading has been swallowed by exes. Of
course, a lot of trade has been lost by early-
closing ; but it is probable that the bar
receipts are as good as ever, though profits
are not so sweet. Everything seems to be
going fairly smoothly. As the figures above
show, after paying a div. averaging over
10 p.c., the management has been able to
set something aside towards the return of
capital. Since just after the reconstruction
the co.’s position has been improved by
£2586. The pace has not been furious; but
the co. has, at any rate, been making in
the right direction. It will need to put on
a spurt to catch up to capital—£l2.2so
(35,000 shares paid to 7s. each) —-by the
time the lease runs out in 11 years or so.
* * * *
Another gold discovery is reported from
Westralia —this time between the Carbine
and Wealth of Nations on the Coolgardie
field. It is not far from one of Speakman’s
old finds, where, in 1893, a rush took place
and several lives were lost from heat and
thirst. So far only a little gold has been
sighted, and until a good deal more has been
found the dryness of the locality—it is
about 15 miles from water —will keep a lot
of diggers from butting in.
“G.”: The supposition that most of the
old workings on the big hill overlooking
Trunke.v Creek, in the Bathurst district
(N.S.W.), might be made to produce some-
thing under up-to-date working methods has
a lot to back it up. The hill is literally
honeycombed with shafts, put down mostly
a f far back as the ’seventies. The water
level was reached at about 80ft. The fact
that there are scores of shafts in the one
restricted area, put down at various times,
is taken to indicate that the earlier ones at
any rate must have given good values.
Most of the shows were owned by Germans.

“ S=W=P” is the RIGHT paint to use
for all buildings - inside and outside
because it is made right; because it
is scientifically prepared for a specific
purpose; and that purpose is to guard
valuable property against the weather.
As it costs less to put good paint on a property
ONCE in a given period than to apply cheap
pa nt TWICE within the same time, it will pay
you well to use “ S-W-P-” first time, and all

MOST RESOURCEFUL OF
THE AUSTRALIAN STATES
Visitors to Sydney and residents of New South Wales
u'/i tt seeking information about the Great Northern State, whether
from a tourist, land settlement, scientific or investment point of view,
should first enquire at the Sydney Branch of the
Queensland Govt. Intelligence & Tourist Bureau.

Apropos the new “copper” coins, the
penny, halfpenny, and farthing are required
to be of the weight respectively of one-third,
one-fifth and one-tenth of an avoirdupois
ounce: so the missus who wants to try a
new recipe and can’t find the ounce weight
has a handy substitute. Incidentally, also,
halfpence are exactly an Imperial inch
across.
Sensible South Aus. has had a conference
of six kinds of churches to see if the differ-
ences in the way of union are as solid as
thev thought. They found that they were
all' jolly good fellows when they got to-
gether, and that they can agree on quite
a number of things. Nothing very definite
was actually done, of course —except that
the Bishop of Adelaide asked everybody to
lunch.
According to the Seaside News (Melb.) :
Mrs. , the principal speaker, stressed the
point that it was the duty of the Council to stop any
increase in infantile morality, which even in San-
dringham was greater than it should be.
It was the sort of statement that a comp,
cculd not set up correctly to save his im-
moral soul.
Like Melbourne, which started in the
world as Bearbrass, or something like
that, Wellington (MX.) dropped its
original moniker. It was christened Britan-
nia, but dropped that'for its present title
after a few months’ trial. Occasionally a
N. S. Wales Government Department still
tries to make Broken Hill believe that its
name is Willyama.
“Mizzen”: It blows a bit at the Maat-
suykers, a group of islands and rocks off
the south coast of Tasmania. The light
keeper used to have a few sheep on the
grassy patches on top of the cliffs, but
had to keep them tied to pegs.
“Ornis”: How Launceston Examiner, in
too much of a hurry, fell over a cliff and
was bitten repeatedly : —-
Visitors to Cliff Grounds.
Striking testimony as to the popularity of the
Cataract Cliff Grounds —when it is remembered that
the period embraces the complete term of the war —
is the fact that during the past five years an
aggregate of 428,390 persons was bitten by a
snake.
“D.F.”: One of the attractions of J. W-
Beattie’s Tasmanian historical museum at
Hobart is a series of drawings of celebrated
bushrangers and criminals of the early days,
from Matthew Brady and his chief associ-
ates downwards. About the mildest and most
harmless-looking of them is Charles Routley.
Routley and another man had stolen a bul-
lock from the farm of Bartholomew Reardon,
district constable at Pittwater, and were
cutting it up when one Jack Buckley came
on them. They got hold of Buckley, wrapped
him in the bullock hide, shoved him on a
fire and roasted him. It is recorded that
during the process Routley remarked, with
much relish: “See lioW the grins!”
His ideas of amusement were something like
those of the Federal Government, which
collects the amusement tax from all visitors
to the show.
A certain Frau Meter lost nine sons in
the war, and this is how the Kaiser com-
forted her: —
His Majesty the Kaiser hears that you have
sacrificed nine sons in defence of the Fatherland in
the present war. His Majesty is immensely gratified
at the fact, and ill recognition is pleased to send
you his photograph with frame and autograph signa-
ture.
If he had been William Webster instead of
merely William Hohenzollern he would have
put it into poetry: —
I greet you, Frail, as trebly lucky
In having sons so staunch and plucky
That every one gave up his life
Without a growl in glorious strife
So that this land might flourish free
Beneath the rule of Mine and Me.
Rejoice, dear frau, that nine have died,
And know your Kaiser’s gratified.
Wilhelm.
P.S.—
You’ll joy to hear, bereaved one,
I have not lost a single son.
W.
“Lautoka” : The white men who came from
Australia to nurse the Fijians through their
plague earned, every one of them, a V.C.
The conditions were dreadful: to make them
worse, during the 20 days the epidemic was
at its height on the Lautoka side of the
island, it rained almost incessantly. All
praise to the quarantine staff in Sydney;
but they had every aid to their hand,
whereas the men in Fiji fought the disease
without doctors or nurses, or even a sufficient
supply of food and medicine. They were mostly
boys in their early twenties, who had
scarcely, if ever, waited on a sick-bed before.
Many of them had been turned down for
active service. But they served splendidly
on another field. Their work —and their
death, in many instances —deserves a
tribute.
“George Street”: The best strategy in
warfare is to be absent when the foe calls.
This was the secret of Napoleon’s failure
at Moscow and of a lot of other things that
broke up likely-looking conquerors. If a
city isn’t at home to pneumonia that city
can’t be killed. It is the month of Febru-
ary; the air is warm, and sunshine is the
best ally of those who want to keep their
health. If there are no tents to accommo-
date the multitudes, let them take their
blankets into the open. It won’t do them
any harm; and if things are made interest-
ing enough for them they would be willing
to sleep on a barbed-wire fence. The
spectacle of the angry microbes clawing the
empty air without finding a victim would
rejoice the heart of the Health Department;
and the scare would die away to nothing
in the excitement of the tree-climbing com-
petition for married women, and the obstacle
race for superannuated stockbrokers.
THE FO’C’S'LE’S TOAST.

Now, here’s a toast for sailormen,
An’ a toast for me:

An’ the next port s Swill.

STRENGTH AND ENERGY CREATED
BY PHOSPHATE.
NO TASK TOO HARD'; NO STRAIN
TOO GREAT.
There is no longer any reason why the
nervous, hesitant man or woman should
envy those who are strong, resourceful and
calm, for according to an eminent specialist
such strength is within the easy reach of
all who desire it. Men and women are
strong, mentally and physically in propor-
tion to the strength of their nerves, and
nerves are strong or weak according to the
amount of phosphate they absorb. Ordin-
arily the - nerves derive phosphate from
digested food, hut owing to faulty meta-
bolism or to abnormal strain, the phosphate
thus taken up often proves insufficient, and
in consequence the nerves become weak and
exhausted. To remedy such a condition it
is necessary that the nerves should be pro-
vided with more phosphate, and the use of
the concentrated bitro-phosphate which most
chemists now stock in the form of 5-grain
compressed tablets is highly recommended.
Phosphate in this form is rapidly absorbed,
and a decided improvement in the general
health is soon noticeable. Nerves become
steady and strong, and the brain acts
quickly and clearly. Eyes become bright,
and the cheeks glow with healthy color.
No task seems too hard; no strain too great.
Abundant energy displaces lassitude, and
great strength reigns in the place of weak-
ness.— ADVT.
A. WOMAN'S
LETTER
DAVID
JONES
FOR
SMART
MILLINERY
Masks and noses are the vital questions.
Particularly the nose. This feature has to
be carefully conciliated when the face-bag is
designed. Probably a strip of flat milliner’s
wire across the top of the gauze camouflage
meets the nose half way, so to speak, and
causes it less indignity than the tight band-
age. Boiling time —pessimists give their
germ-catchers ten minutes in galloping water
- -is now the hour at which Mrs. Prettyface
used to be decorating herself for an evening
party. You bag your supply of the enemy
battalions by day, and if you haven’t con-
sumed them meantime, you boil them o’
nights. Everything else postponed.
The mask as frequently worn by small
boys—as an extra necktie—-is not quite
so hygienic as the authorities wish it to be.
Monday morning also brought the occasional
mask-dodger, who sometimes held his small
cage in his hand and glared defiantly at the
closely-muzzled company in the crowded tram.
His unpopularity with fellow-passengers (it
was nearly always a male who had broken
quarantine) could only be intimated by stern
glances over the top of adjacent muslin
barriers.
I first sighted him as he was tumbling
head-first off a Sydney tram. When
he made his clumsy rush at the moving car
he was shoving a tray of muslin influenza
masks in front of him. In trying to save
these he had missed his hold on the guard-
rail and was on the way to be cut to pieces.
The thousandeth part of a segond crawled
by like a wounded centipede. At last his
shoulder struck Circular Quay and he rolled
over and over—away from the car, thank
God! His masks blew about in the dust.
The tram slid past and pulled up. As the
conductor glared at him, the kid jumped up,
collected the germ distributors, tumbled
them on to the tray and rushed off to sell
them. A lot of us may not get influenza,
but we shall certainly get something else.
Marie Eaton, whose fine voice and breezy
personality are so popular in musical comedy,
is ill with the pestilence.
The Methody Ladies’ College (Bunvood)
has postponed the junketting over its new
wing in consequence of the ’flu. The same
remark applies to all sorts of big gatherings.
Tea-parties were the' first institutions to
close down before the unwelcome visitor; it
was found inconvenient to sip Fekoe through
five folds of gauze.
The ’flu invasion has caused John Fitz-
gerald, Minister for Public Health, to pro-
hibit church worship, thus making history
repeat itself after 700 years. At that time
another John—John Angevin, professionally
known as King John—did something the
same by interdict. He failed owing to the
church-going propensities of the people plus
the opposition of Archbishop Langton. Our
John has neither of these worries, owing to
the proximity of surf-bathing beaches, Sun-
day newspapers and friendly archbishops.
City and suburban schools are closed;
but “Redlands” and one or two others with
boarders on their hands have fled liolus
bolus to the Mountains.
Blacklieath, after putting out the fires
that threatened the town a week or two ago,
was able to note a Y.W.C.A. invasion. The
convention which had chosen the cool hill-
tops for its Summer conference is now, so
far as S. Australian and Queensland dele-
gates are concerned, waiting in Sydney to
catch some sure means of transport to their
homes.
It doesn’t take long for the Zoo monkeys
to pick up the latest fashions. On Satur-
day a youngster dropped a handkerchief in
the spider-monkeys’ pit. For the next half-
hour they were all busy tying it round one
another’s jaws.
The Comforts Depots which had just got
into swing again have shut up with a snap.
Only for a Aveek or two, Susie hopes.
Artists with a big folloAving of students
are turning their classes into outdoor sketch-
excursions till masks are off. Dattilo Rubbo’s
picturesque red" Garibaldi tie now' Waves "in"
the open, while young persons attack the
nearest scenery with a pencil.
The proposals to be. laid before the
approaching Labor Conference include
almost everything except polygamv. Still,
the question may come up yet. It has been
not uncommon, after a war which wiped
out a vast proportion of the male popula-
tion, to legalise polygamy so that the cradle
might refill rapidly and there might be
people growing up to man the nation’s in-
dustries and provide for its defence. Also,
when under ordinary conditions two women
out of three must be without male protec-
tors, and live that unnatural hermit life of
celibacy which leads to the cultivation of
cats, something seemed necessary to prevent
a blight of cats falling on the community.
If a healthy man was capable of earning a
good income the law held that he might res-
cue six women from loneliness instead of
one till times became normal.
Some of the German states tried this sys-
tem in a legal way after the Thirty Years
War, and Paraguay tried it in an untidy
fashion after Lopez’s Napoleonic schemes
had ruined the country in 1864-70. Ger-
many made some experiments in that line
during the present war. The Mormons
adopted numerous marriage because they
were in haste to raise a nation of Latter-
Day Saints that could cope with the Gen-
tiles, and women converts—woman being a
poor and abundant animal —could be more
easily procured than men. The United
States didn't definitely abolish polygamy
until 1882. Australia’s losses in the war
have been comparatively small, but the lost
have been almost all men, and a considerable
rush of imported brides has further damaged
the marriage market. The Labor Confer-
ence should look ahead and define the party’s
position re polygamy lest the question should
be sprung upon it unawares.
In March Quartain Levitt Deloitte will
celebrate the 60th anniversary of his first
win in a Sydney
boat-race. With an-
other fine oarsman,
Charles Mansfield, he
pulled against and
beat two broad-
shouldered young
men (there were
giants in those days)
named George and
Tom Dibbs. This
was at a Balmain
Regatta. Later the
Deloitte brothers
and the Fitzhard-
inges developed a
healthy rivalry
which made their
contest star turns in
local aquatics. For
in those days such
residents of our old town as were not taking
the air in a high gig were mostly growing
forearm muscles on the water. The ancient
chronicler is silent as to women’s prowess
with sculls: but they certainly “dressed” for
ancient regattas with the same attention to
detail that marked a big pre-war race-day.
Sydney Rowing Club was opened in 1870;
Q. L. Deloitte was unanimously chosen
captain, and later was elected president.
Until five or six years ago, “Quanty” and
his lifelong friend, A. P. Backhouse (Dis-
trict Court Judge) used to pull over a dis-
tance that would have knocked out less sea-
soned oarsmen. Q.L., the son of an early
Sydney shipping merchant, has stood for ail
that is best in marine sport so long that
youngsters at the game believe that the old
Sydney Rowing Club took its colors—light
blue —from the tint of his eyes.
The five daughters of John Harnett, of
Cooma, have done their bit during the last
four years. Hilda went to Egypt as typist
to the Red Cross, and later was sent to
London. Frances followed as typist to the
A.C.F. Commissioners in Egypt, and when
she moved to London her place was taken
by sister Florence. Jessie nursed in Egypt,
Palestine, and Salonika; and the youngest
girl Kathleen, a military nurse, was called
to Sydney Quarantine Station on the out-
break of influenza. She caught the disease
herself, but pulled through and is now con-
valescing:
In the Education Gallery a recent display
of State and High School work showed signs
of all-round improvement.. Unfortunately,
however, owing to the quantity of exhibits,
the arrangement was too reminiscent of a
jumble sale. The teacher is apparently im-
paled on the horns of Terror. From fear of
discouraging the child or its maternal parent
—she is- apt to bitterly resent the rejection
of ’Tilda’s handiwork —exhibits which are
worthless overcrowd good stuff. China-paint-
ing and needlework were in the front line
when Big Sister got busy. Little brother
smears much brown paper with landscape in
colored chalk, or turns out plasticene vil-
lages with water laid on. Most interesting
was a loan display of work done by Chinese
and Japanese infants in their far-off schools.
By way of getting color into his noddle the
small Chinese makes little round blobs and
paints them like a display of toy balloons.
He gets form by weird splashes that look
like Arabic letters. Then lie sketches his
father (back view) with the familiar baskets
swung on his shoulders, and an outsize in
hats.
The British residents in Yokohama, Japan,
had a fancy dress ball to celebrate the
armistice. It was a splendid affair. Mrs.
Simpson-Baikie, who used to be our Con-
stance Brandon-Usher, appeared as “Aus-
tralian Music” and carried off one of the
prizes.
From.a woman on the Western plains:—
Out here in the drought-cursed west I’m reading
a Sydney paper so dried by the heat that it
crackles like tin. It contains peevish letters from
gardening suburbanites who moan about the pro-
hibition of lawn-sprinklers! Lawns! Why even
our tough old gebaniums, heavy with dust, have
caved in; while we humans are hard put to it
to get enough water to drink. Baths! Frankly,
no! Dams and paddock tanks nearly all dry,
household supplies depleted long ago ; no rain
since August. For drinking and cooking purposes
the water has to be carted from the paddock tank —
if you or a generous and lightly-stocked neighbor
happen to have one with a couple of feet still in
it. The water thus transported is a thick, vague,
red-black stuff not always odorless. It is cleared
with lime or salts, then boiled. Washing day is
tragic for the housewife, for the linen persists in
turning out an obstinate drab, work as she may.
Everywhere is dust. The heavy wheat waggons
pounded the roads and tracks into beds of it,
and now all day long the place is aswirl with
suffocating clouds. The constant passing of stock
being driven to water and the roll of the water carts
keep us interested. The wandering politician or
armchair cocky will explain that the farmer is
an improvident cuss. He should sink sufficient
tanks and equip the house or humpy with enough
iron tanks to secure a never-failing supply of rain
water. What’s he going to do it on? The bit he
has been getting for his wheat never gets past
O’Rafferty at the corner store —in fact, it is never
enough to catch up to O’Rafferty." It costs some-
thing to sink large tanks and experiment with
bores, and the price of iron tanks has been pro-
hibitive ever since the war started. That’s where
the city farmer fails us. Why doesn’t he grow
cheap iron tanks for us ?
When Sydney heard Howard White, whose
sudden death in New York is an unexpected
happening of the past fortnight, he was easily
one of the most robust men in the hall.
His stentorian voice didn’t raise much en-
thusiasm when he tackled classics. But
when an encore number was a quaint negro
melody, such as he had often heard on
Southern cotton-fields, he held the house.
The Scotney-Whites were a devoted duet on
and off the platform, and the lady will be
desolate.
“Trooper Bluegum’s” note :
Taking a nurse home to hospital over the Canal
from Port Said, she hesitated before entering the
boat and demanded of the boatman “Are you a
Christian 1 or a Mohammedan?” The Gvppie an-
swered: “Me Mohammedan.” “Righto,” said sister,
and we went aboard. I was at a loss- to under-
stand her preference for a non-Christian boatman,
till a medical officer told me the following incident:
“Coming home over the Canal the other night with
a nurse I settled myself, comfortably in the stern
of the boat and in all innocence put my arm
on sister's shoulder. Judge of my astonishment
when the Gyppie boatman exclaimed, ‘Here none of
that —me dinkum Christian.’ ”
Mrs. Martha Deery, well known in chari-
table committees, and long associated with
St. A incent’s Hospital, died last week in
Sydney.
About 25 years
ago Andrew Black’s
noble baritone filled
St. James’s Hall
(London)and Melba
was on the same
concert programme. A
few weeks ago (Jan.
14) the Scottish
artist, wh o ha s mad e
Sydney his home,
was again associ-
ated with our Sove-
reign Voice. This
was at the Dame’s
concert to her old
friend John Lem-
mone. It was at the
invalid’s special re-
quest that Andrew,
who rarely sings
nowadays except at patriotic or’ charity
entertainments, delighted a huge audience
with the art on which his great reputation
was built up years ago. Unlike many noted
vocalists, the Glasgow man does not suffer
troin too much “temperament”; hence his
joy in teaching. “After studying at home,
and believing myself to be a true basso can-
tante, I went to Italy and lost that illusion,”
lie says. “For three years I worked under
the tuition of Scafati, in Naples, and learnt
m> place as a baritone, though with a wide
range My chance came a little later when
Ml? ,r So . w Choral Union wanted Foli for
ihe Messiah.’ He was gambling at Monte
Carlo and apparently oblivious of his en-
gagement. They sent for me to stop the
breach. Since then the baritone has sung
in grand opera, in oratorio, and on concert
platforms in all the big cities of Europe and
merica - But I had to dodge bronchitis
all my 'life, and this is the climate for me.
So here I hope to live and keep the nuisance
at bay with the finest antidote in the world
—Australian sunshine.” Photo by Judith
Fletcher.
Andrew Black remembers London Crystal
Palace during its palmy days (and its
palmy days have only been interludes), when
the one man who could run it successfully
w r as manager. “He was Henshaw Russell,
a post captain in the Royal Navy ; and when
I was singing there,” says Andrew, “he
had got rid of all those people formerly con-
nected with the place who had been accus-
tomed to rob managements with impunity.
With good business methods and rigid dis-
cipline the old salt did what no one else, so
far as 1 know, has ever accomplished since.”
The E- J. Cobcrofts, who have been living
in Bananaland, are coming back to N. S.
Wales. Late good citizen Pat O’Brien lent
his roomy waterside house at Woolwich as a
Red Cross convalescent haven, on condition
that Mrs. A. J. Hare, of the same suburb,
was hon. matron. Changes a few months
ago in this respect broke the spirit of the
agreement. Mr. O’Brien meanwhile had died
alter a long illness, and the property belongs
to his daughter, Mrs. Cobcroft, who inteuus
to live in her old home.
Adrian Knox, K.C., is turning the corner
after an illness which lately sent him. to a

A young Sydney contralto, better known
on the North side of the harbor —Muriel
Casey—was wed at Chatswood the other
day. Harold Dengate, of the same settle-
ment, was the co-conspirator.
The Mountains’ menageries for paying
guests, also the less camouflaged private
hotels and furnished cottages, are doing a
booming business. The bush fires added a
lurid glow last week to the purple haze that
gives the down of a blue plum to the hill
scenery. Chief Justice Cullen’s house at
Leura had a narrow escape, but the fire-
fighters saved it.
Captain Emden Glossop is the father of a
small Australian daughter. The charming
mother of the recent arrival was one of the
McPhillamys, of Bathurst, and the infant
was born in the maternal home.
Landed in Sydney with a recent batch of
returned Diggers, Nurse Flora Gilchrist, of
a well-known Cremorne family. Two
brothers lost their lives in France.
Sydney’s old friend H. H. Share, R.N.,
comes out with Jellicoe to Australia, ap-
parently as secretary. He had that job on
various State Governors’ staffs in Sydney,
and, later, joined the Governor-General’s.
No man in the same billet-—not even the
evergreen Wallington—was better liked than
the amiable and discreet Share.
The Walter Swansons are staying with
the v.r. Davidsons at Sutton Forest for a
week or so. The lady, as you remember,
was the gifted pianist Beatrice Griffiths.
She and her legal husband will shortly be
on the wing for the other side.
Passed through Sydney on his way from
Papua to Melbourne, Lieut.-Governor
Murray. He essayed the great adventure of
crossing the border by train, but will return
by sea, and go through the usual medical
exam, at the Heads. Son Pat is to take
three years and a science course at Sydney
University, with two years at Oxford to
follow. The lad is a naturalist by instinct,
and is going to follow his vocation.

Prince Alfred Hospital Jubilee is having
a mixed time owing to the restriction put
upon meetings. The big carnival was to
have opened on Feb. 21. Now?
Prawning parties, when the tide serves,
are favorite recreations these quiet summer
evenings. The company, having removed its
shoes and stockings indoors (for a rendez-
vous a house with a waterfront is preferred),
creeps down the dark foreshore with a lan-
tern. The small prey darts with bulging
eyes at the net. After the funeral he gets
his red jacket, and supper is served.
Mary Marlowe, an Australian girl who
w r as on the stage for some time, sends a line
from London. She’s in the spasms of writ-
ing a third book, but is, in wmrking hours,
still a senior in a military hospital.
“It lias been tremendously interesting,” she
says, “and has licked even the most unprac-
tical —possibly me—into shape !”

£179 saved by this repair
with an Oxy-Acetylene Blowpipe
The illustration shows some parts of a 50-ton
Brick Press belonging to the Austral Brick Co.,
St. Peters, N.S.W.
It was a smash to bewilder the most experienced
engineer, and the job was generally considered
impossible to repair. The cost of replacing the
parts would have meant an outlay of nearly £ 2OO,
and Messrs. Welding and Cutting Limited, 107
Bathurst Street, Sydney, set out to save the
press by Oxy-Acetylene Welding.
The Oxy-Acetylene Repair was a huge success, and the
press has been working for over six weeks without showing
the slightest defect. The cost of the Repair was only £2l.
This is the kind of saving that Oxy-Acetylene Welding
is effecting day after day, placing broken machinery
speedily in commission, and saving the enormous cost of
spare parts.
The leading Engineering Shops, Garages, Mines, Smelters and
Foundries throughout Australia use the Oxy-Acetylene Welding
and Cutting Process continuously. For those who cannot use a
separate outfit we have operators everywhere. Write to us for the
address of your nearest, and take all your repair troubles to him.
The Bow was broken in half , the Double

The Chirnside-Thiel wedding, on January
29, was the social kick-off of the year. Cap-
tain Gordon Chirnside has just returned,
and his bride is one of the prettiest girls
in Melbourne. Her bridal toggery struck
the literary girls so hard that their spelling
was. worse than usual for days. The sim-
plicity of white expensiveness surrounded
her. She is usually a rosy young flapper,
but the seriousness of the event left her
white and misty-eyed. Women everywhere
cried a little at sight of her, and then braced
up and powdered their noses like heroines.
Bridegroom Gordon, at the wedding-tea,
caught hold of her wrist during his speech
and nearly broke it in the intensity of his
emotion as lie spoke of the long war-years he
bad waited for her.
Gordon is the son of the late Robert Chirn-
side and his step-father is Justice Hodges.
The Hodges dame was a sweet vision in
grey, and Mavis’s young mother wore nut-
brown tulle and velvet. Mollie Dood made
Scot’s Church and the Menzies’ party-room
gorgeous with flowers. The ’groom’s station
is, Caramballac, near Skipton, and the
guests were all the very best merinoes from
the Western District. Many of them had
known the young man from his knicker-
bocker moments.
At the kirk a starred and crowned guard
of honor lined the aisle. There were three
generals in it and all stood at the salute as
the bride entered. Dr. Balcombe Quick and
Lieut. Cliff Anderson, both returned war-
riors, were “best men” and got some sparkle
into their speeches; Anderson appealing to
the single girls to “give the preference to
returned soldiers.” Betty O’Hara and
Beryl Fitts (two experienced bridesmaids)
helped the. decorative effect with big tulle
hats. Their wonderful dresses were mostly
green and silver. Colonel Riggall’s small
son Billy helped Mary Guy Smith to carry
the bride’s train. The bridegroom and his
aides wore their swords. The Hodges pair
lent their Maeedon house for the honeymoon.
Mavis motored away in a neat little blue
suit and a tiny hat.
Miss Ducker (she’s a Sydney heiress)
came over to the Mavis Tiiiel-Gordon
Chirnside wedding and delivered a toilet
set of tortoiseshell brushes for the bride.
The shell is inlaid in silver and gold. Mrs.
Griffiths was another to grasp at the idea;
she presented writing-table bits built of
silver and shell. Melba set the expensive
habit in Melbourne by showing off a toilet
table set made of the rare plain amber parts
taken from Old Slowcoach’s keel. Each
piece was lit with “N.M.” in diamonds.
When Lady Stanley and her brood leave
for England next month we will lose the
most likeable dame we have had for years
at Government House. She is sweet, orna-
mental, unaffected, and most of the - other
things the wives of Governors are usually
described as being, but are not. Also her
dressing has made the memory of many of
the others seem like a disordered recollec-
tion of a bargain counter.
You don’t offer a friend a pinch of snuff
nowadays; but you can chum up and tender
your favorite disinfectant. One Melbourne
woman collected in one evening sundry
sniffs of camphor cakes, three lots of tablets
and a squeeze of anti-’flu paste for the nos-
trils. She retaliated wfth a squirt from a
glass spray concealed in a powder puff.
Edmund Fisher, The Bulletin's much-
loved Melbourne manager, has been a very
sick man for some time. After an absence
of several months, he recently resumed his
visits to the theatres, of which he has been
writing brilliantly for over 30 years; but
his enthusiasm caused him to get back into
harness too soon, the result being that he
has had to return to a private hospital.
There are many people in this quarantined
village who are. less cheerful because of Mr.
Fisher’s absence from his old haunts.
Long before the heavy-footed authorities
had got a move on, several suburban host-
esses had issued invitations 'to inoculation
parties.. A doctor—voung and presentable,
if possible—was hired for the afternoon or
evening and the business of puncturing the
arms of guests was carried out in an inter-
val between music and sandwiches.
Mjjjor Robert Ramsay, of Mooleric, who
with his brother Urquliart has a firm grip on
the Winelielsea sheep-region, is “doing” the
U.S.A. with Mrs. Ran.say, while making
gradually back to the old homestead.
The Austral Salon has hurriedly cancelled
its glad gatherings and is busy making-
masks. Concerning these masks, artist Hal
Gye’s aesthetic soul has revolted at the
white pads of plain gauze with the untidy
home-made knots of cotton tape. So he
has taken to his studio and is evolving a
dainty design.
Artist Hal Gye welcomed back a Digger
brother last week. The warrior had been
in Gallipoli, Egypt, Palestine, France, and
otherwhere since 1914, but he has little to
show that he has been living close to excite-
ment for four years. His nearest call was
when a shell dropped into a party of seven
in a shell-hole and he was the* only one
who was picked up in one piece. There is
another undamaged Gye still away who has
almost as long a record. A third, Sydney,
will never get home. He was killed in
Palestine.
More language! Girls are no longer
tarts, tabbies, donahs, clinahs, bunches of
cuddle or pieces with the returned men.
They are “bint?.” It sounds suspicious, but
is merely Arabic and means just “girls.”
Estelle Boyd and her mother are off to
England by way of America, and the big
house at St. Kilda is up for auction.
Estelle is travelling towards an English
altar. The other party is Carlton Suttor,
a man who has been doing scientific muni-
tion work.
Ivy Watson Cooper, the rich Bendigonian
who yearns to act, has gone to Sydney and
will be in hospital for a time. When she is
convalescent the lady intends to advance
on U.S.A. with the purpose of playing in
the movies.
This is a recent
portrait of Evelyn
Scotney, who is just
about to make her
appearance in grand
opera in New York
—if the death of
husband Howard
White hasn’t can-
celled her musical
plans. The young
Melbournite with
the wonderful
soprano ha s a
genius for dressing,
and, during the con-
cert. season she
shared with her hus-
band, kept the local
dress critics in-
terested with a hril-
licint series of platform frocks. It was good
business, for, while many women have only
a faint interest in concert music, no civil-
ised female was ever kmswn to be indifferent
to clothes. But it will be weeds now.
Eddie Waters and his decorative wife are
off on a round-the-world tour.
Professer Tucker definitely resigns from
the University, after long and honorable
service amongst the dry bones and dust of
the old Greeks who wrote and philosophied
instead of opening restaurants. His books
have won high approval at Cambridge,
Oxford, Paris, Berlin and Harvard. Burning
with enthusiasm, but coldly calm, he has
been compared to Mt. Erebus, the Antarctic
volcano covered with ice and snow.
The feminine mask-wearers who annoy
dress critics most are those who tangle
wisps _of their back hair with the tape
fastenings. A\ hy doesn’t the Government
appoint dress censors? Many a hat calls
for a prohibition order or a court-martial.
Louise Dyer cancelled a big party for
last week because of the ’flu. Her regret
cards went out each with a tiny bag of
camphor tethered by ribbons at the corner.
An Australian girl in Uncle Sam’s re-
public says that N'Yark is hopping mad.
Dancing goes on all day and all night at
hotels and cafes. Decorative girls are hired
for the evening by males who are going to
a hop and wish to gain reflected notoriety
by reason of the beauty of their partner.
An engagement of the kind does not imply
anything else, a majority of the girls in
the better-class cafes being perfectly well-
behaved. Dancers in trousers are also
hired; sometimes by the afternoon, their
job then being to accompany their tempor-
ary possessor upon her round of the shops
and fooderies, open the door of her auto.,
belp her on and off with her cloak, form
themselves into a guard of honor when she
enters a cafe, and generally earn their money
by the beauty of their persons and the per-
fection of their manners. Eyebrow opera-
tions are another craze.' The fashionable
eyebrow must look like an extremely thin
pencilled arch, the effect being achieved by
the scientific removal of two-thirds of the
hair nature plants above the average optic.
Captain E. T. Boddam, who returned
here with the first batch of Anzacs on
furlough, has been appointed secretary of
the Athenaeum Club. At the front he was
an A.M.C. quartermaster, and gained men-
tion m despatches and a Military Cross
Adelaide tells all: —
After a month’s spell, patriotic committees are
getting to work again, and on Saturday the annual
regatta at Henley Beach raised a useful cheque for
refurnishing the Y.M.C.A.’s Lady Galway Club-
house. The Children’s Patriotic Fund is also plan-
ning its work for 1919, and has decided that its
assistance will chiefly go to the societies and com-
mittees that extend a helping hand to Billjim on
his return. Few war workers in this State have
done better than the children, and the cash value
of their efforts in the past two vears is set down
at £lOO,OOO.
The South Aus. Soldiers’ Fund has decided to
make no further appeal for help for its own activi-
ties, but, if the Repatriation Department is will-
ing, to utilise this year's Australia Day for launch-
ing an appeal for a national memorial and to
invite all patriotic bodies to co-operate.
The Anzac Arch was opened by the Premier on
Tuesday night. The Arch, which spans the road-
way leading from the railway-station to King
IV illiam Road, was suggested by the women work-
ers at the Cheer-up Hut who set to work to
subscribe or collect the necessary funds. The formal
ceremony on Tuesday was interrupted by an in-
formal one that was far more appropriate. A big
batch of men from the Argyllshire arrived in the
middle of the proceedings, and speeches were cut
off and officials swept to one side while the Diggers
came through.
Professor Kerr Grant, after 14 years’ teaching
without a spell, is off to .■Uperica and England
on a year’s holiday with his wife and two children.
It won’t be all holiday, though, for he plans to
look into scientific matters in England and America,
and especially to get some experience in the huge
research laboratory of the General-Electric Co. at
New Yoflk.
Capt. A. H. Nelson, who was military Governor
of both Jericho and Jenin after their capture,
gives some illuminating figures as to the weakness
of the Light Horse Regiments, especially after
their long vigil in the Valley of the Jordan. At
one time 60 per cent, of the 3rd. Light Horse
Brigade were down with malaria, and and
cholera were rampant. He describes Damascus as
the filthiest tow-n the Australians encountered.”
Two old identities passed out during the week—
Mis. W. F. Hughes, of Woodside, who came here
80 jeais ago and had lived in the Nairne district
ever since, and Mrs. G. F. Day, mother of our
railways traffic manager. She was 90.
H. M. Mudie is to take Mr. Poole’s place as
Savings-Bank manager; he has been with the bank
since ’75, when business was carried on ■in a
room in the Town Hall.
A sheaf of congratulations and good wishes will
go from this State to the handsome Downer dame
or: her engagement to D’Arcy Wentworth Addison,
Under-Sec. for Tasmania. She was a popular figure
in public and social life here and Adelaide has missed
her. Before her first marriage she was one of the
Russell girls of Sydney.
News comes from South Africa of the death of
R. A. larlton. Forty years ago he was a leading
figure in Adelaide, M.L.C. from 1873 to 1888, mem-
ber of the soft-goods firm of G. and R. Wills,
pastoralist, and chairman of directors of the old
Commercial Bank of S.A. He left for Africa in
1893, and was equally active there, being specially
thanked by the British Government for his work
as chairman of the Australian Association in
Johannesburg before the war. The mite was nearly
91 at the end, and attributed his robust age and good
spirits to a sour-milk diet. One of the Tarlton sons,
with another Adelaide man, Newland, made all the
arrangements for Roosevelt’s shooting-trip in Africa.
Heibeit Phillips, of Adelaide, is a son-in-law.
Howard White, a
victim to ’flu in
New York, was 36.
The tragedy has
made a beautiful
widow of Evelyn
Scotney, the Aus-
tralian soprano w'ho
has scored so well
in America. Besides
being a baritone and
a ’cellist, he was an
incomparable busi-
ness manager, and
steered liis wife
through a trium-
phal Austral ian
tour. With her he
was billed for. a
grand opera appear-
ance in New York.
In the meantime Evelyn was studying lan-
guages while he fulfilled singing engage-
ments. Mr. and Mrs. Scotney, of Melbourne,
are off on the Makura next month to join
their widowed daughter.
You remember Dulcie Deamer (now Mrs.
Albert Goldie), who made the inkpot warm,
up occasionally when she dipped her pen
into it? She has had a helping of sorrow
in the death of her father, Dr. G. E. Deamer,
of Maoriland. He was a well-known physi-
cian across the Tasman. Mrs. Goldie is in
U.S. and another daughter wears the veil
in a convent in Sydney.
Contralto “Peggy” Seccombe was' quietly
married to L. C. Kavanagli at Glenferrie
last week. Peggy, in pink and white
georgette supporting a large family of hand-
made roses, swam to the altar on the arm
of her mamma, who subsequently poured
provisions into a famished multitude at the
Francatelli. Mrs. Kavanagh is now honey-
mooning at Sassafras and later on will
vanish to Bendigo.
At Salonika lately Sister May Duncan
Smith, of Beaudesert (Q.), was married to
Lieut. H. Woolam, of Manchester, England.
The ceremony took place at G.H.Q. Chapel,
Sister M. E. Jones refereeing for the bride,
who was given away by Col. V. J. Crawford,
D. 5.0., O.C. of the hospital to which Sister
Duncan Smith was attached. Lieut, and
Mrs. Woolam left by train the same day
for England via Athens.
Sculptor Web Gilbert, now the husband
of an English girl, lately became the proud
father of twins.
The Y.W.C.A., with a growing member-
ship of flappers, has had to appoint an
organising secretary to look after them.
Eileen Gates, who is a B.A. of Melbourne
University, L.'.s been given the job, and she
will have' to sort out 400 girls under 2ft
and assemble them in various “circles” and
clubs. It sounds more interesting than
the stuffy teaching billet in which the femi-
nine Arts-graduate usually finds herself
dead-ended, disillusioned and bound for no-
where-in-particular after her three years of
midnight-oiling.
The Australian Comforts Fund at the
Town Hall is making a feature of dried
lavender, put up in sixpenny bags for
perfuming linen-cupboards. Lavender, by
the way, is now a' staple product of some
commercial gardens carried on by women-
folk in the outer Melbourne suburbs, the
demand being generally more than equal to
the supply.
Rita Kirkpatrick, a pampered young
Sydney amateur, with the Rigo Opera Co.,
has been hauled back home by father because
of the ’flu. Various box parties watched
her grand operaties, and smart supper sprees
followed.
Virginia Roche, whom the Taits imported
for “Jack and Jill,” ought to know enough
of flumonia to write an essay on it for
the South Street competitions. She was
in America while it raged there, she came
to Australia in a ’flu-ridden ship, she was
quarantined in Sydney, and she has been
imprisoned in a St. Kilda flat because a
couple of cases have been discovered on the
premises.
Of the immense variety of masks which
have made their appearance since the ’flu
germ came to Melbourne, the most striking
seen to date was worn by Muriel Starr—
an ethereal affair of pink chiffon kept in
place by a baby-ribbon attachment.
Fayette Perry (now Mrs. Jim Allison)
is not giving up the stage. She is off to fill
an engagement in the States where her
accent grew.
Retired-pilot Captain Henry Press lately
presented to the Port Phillip Pilots a hand-
made oil-painting, executed by himself, of
the pilot-steamer Alvina knocking about
outside the Heads. Captain Press has two
hobbies, ships and art, and he knows a lot
about ships. However, by precept and
practice, he - lias also done his best to en-
courage art in his family. A daughter was
some years ago put to learn painting at the
National Gallery; and a nephew has just
completed over four years in Germany,
where he happened to be studying musical
composition when the war started.
. The design Web Gilbert evolved for the
big statue, at St. Quentin has been model-
led in miniatures for submission to the
Fi'ench. It is a solitary Australian soldier
di'iving his bayonet into an eagle, fighting
for life on its back at his feet.
. Two of Melbourne's most palacious man-
sions are changing hands. The Creswick
establishment at Malvern, next to the Bowes
Kelly shack, and only two doors from State
Government House, has been sold for
£2.5,000. It will be a school-house. Negoti-
ations are also going on for the purchase of
a Jen tines, at Malvern East, foi’merly
owned by that earnest Scotchbyterian. J. M.
Davies, president of the Vic. Leg. Council,
rsow the property of a syndicate, the place
was built during the boom, and its ballroom
is about the biggest in Melbourne —all par-
quetted scrumptiously. Valentines is to
be. taken over by the R.C. establishment and
will be a school, too.
“E.J.M.” ; The suggestion (B. 23/1/T9)
that the military police should be seasoned
men from the Front instead of shirkers from
the back, is a very sensible one, especially in
view of the swarms of hefty warriors who
will soon be learning about asking what
Australia is going to do for them. These
malcontents will, need very careful handling.
But the trouble is. to get the genuine soldier
to take on the military policeman’s job. It
has become detested all over the world owing
to the conduct of a lot of bullies and xvorse.
xhe popular description of the m.p. is that
“f ' lower than a snake’s belly!” Before
the Department will be able to get anv mmi-
•h i C oocl men i<: wi]l have t 0 niake it
widely known that the whole force has been
closely scrutinised and combed out.


KEEP CEEAN
Inside and Out and Minimise the Risß
of Influenza.
The Public are warned to take no
chances with the Influenza epidemic
which has made its appearance in Australia, and the first
essential is cleanliness inside and out. Take Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills freely—nothing better could be had at any
price in an emergency of this kind. If an attack of the real
Influenza develops send for the doctor and go straight to
bed. Don’t try to fight it. If you have an attack of the
real Influenza your digestion will be a wreck, your head,
legs and back will ache, your heart action may be affected,
and you will have a temperature. These conditions need
the attention of a skilled medical attendant
It stands every member of the community in hand to so look after their
general health to prevent if possible becoming infected with this deadly
germ, and to accomplish this no better remedy could be taken than Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills. They are a searching, cleansing remedy.
They are mild in their action, but highly effective in cleansing the system
of all impurities and preventing germs getting a chance to incubate.
Petroleum Oils, Salts, Tonics and other so-called remedies are of little
use to cleanse the system and keep these germs in check; in fact they will
have a tendency to aggravate an already deranged gastric condition. It
would also be advisable to take from 5 to 10 grains of ASPIRIN two or
three times daily if feeling out of sorts, or 10 grains of QUININE on
retiring at night the same time as the pills are taken. A common cold can
usually be broken up if either AbPIRIN or QUININE are taken with
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills on the first indication of a cold.
Following these simple precautions may prevent an attack of serious
illness. If you get the real influenza do as already stated: send for the
doctor and go to bed. Don’t try and doctor yourself. The complaint is
too dangerous to take chances with. The doctor may or may not allow
you to continue taking Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills. In any case, follow
his directions both with medicine and food, and you will be on the safe side


The Teague of Nations’ idea is still in embryo,
and Wilson is still nursing his baby, while Billy
Hughes yaps unceasingly about Australia’s threatened
interests in the Pacific. A judicious use of King
George IV., the whisky of the wise, would settle
the problems and give universal satisfaction.— Advt.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
DON'T TINKER
LET
MICK SIMMONS
DO THE JOB
PROPELY
The ’flu has put most forms of sport
under an anaesthetic, so far as N. S. Wales is con-
cerned. Racing, boxing and billiards have gone.
Sailing, cricket and tennis remain. But people are
crowded together in boats, and they foregather round
tennis courts and ovals and in pavilions and dressing-
rooms. Also, the fewer there are to go (say) racing
the more there will be available to bloat the
crowds at other sports. Surfing is no doubt healthy
in principle, but as conducted at 'daces like Bondi
and Manly it is about the most congested pastime
known. _ If the position gets worse, and stoppage of
all sport throughout the Commonwealth is on the
cards, it would be a unique chance to revive walking
for pleasure and exercise, and push-biking. But the
main roads leading out of our great cities are some
of the worst in the civilised world. The dust that
billows eternally along their broken surfaces is an
abomination and a menace to people on foot. And
as an outcome of the horrible road conditions the
health-giving bike, which survives in Europe, is
almost dead here.

J. W. Larnach, who died last week in
England, was a genuine sportsman. As a cricketer
he was just short of county class in his day.
He was a good oar and specialised in long-distance
rowing. And he was a useful cross-country rider.
Jeddah was suspected by the stable to be a hot
thing for the Derby in 1898, and Larnach put the
then Prince of Wales on to him. The Prince took
the tip and made - a financial punch which he badly
needed at the time. Larnach himself, like many
rich turfites, was practically a non-bettor.

Balarang, whose sprint with lOst. 41b. up
was a feature of the last A.J.C. meeting, is of the
class of Blair and Gigandra. All big horses —16.2
or thereabouts—none showed so much quality as
Balarang. Blair carried the terrific impost of
12st. 121 b. in an amateur scramble once and won
with it. Gigandra scored two seconds and a third
in three successive excursions, carrying respectively
fist. 101 b„ 9st. 51b., and 9st. 101 b.

“Mulruana”: MeShortodds is perturbed
over a recent decision of Wren’s (Vic.) stewards.
In a “concession” bet a book laid £l2 to £2 about
an animal which dead-heated. The punter was
offered £7. He claimed £B, contending that his
two quid should escape the halving axe. MeShortodds
pleaded the ruling of the V.R.C., which decided that,
in the event of a dead-heat, concession wagers should
.be treated as straight-out bets. Wren’s stipes gave
judgment for the punter. They added a rider that,
under the V.R.C. ruling, it might pay a fortune-
hunter better for his horse to run third than to
dead-heat for first if betting on the concession lurk.
And they were right. Take, for instance, the case
of a man laying £2 to £1 on (money returned in
the event of its running 2nd or 3rd). In a dead-
heat, and payment under the V.R.C. ruling, this
would return him 305., a loss of 10s. on the deal,
whereas if the horse had filled third place behind a
dead-heating pair he would he ten bob up inasmuch
as his £2 stake would be refunded.
The dead-heat convention has always caused rows and
confusion and it always will. In the opinion of this page
it is too involved for the punter who, slightly muddled by
race-course refreshment, slams his money down casu-
ally,’ and as casually takes what the bookie tenders
him. In the case stated above the punter was rightly
offered £7 —rightly, that is, under the arrangement
at present in vogue. He got half what he would
have won had his horse won alone (viz. £6), and
he at the same time lost half his stake of £2—
result, £7. This is an example of the system under
cash betting. Where the bet is booked the method
of getting at the result is different. Suppose the
dead-heating horse starts at three to one. The
rule is that the odds and the stake are added; there-
fore, if the speculator is betting in sovereigns he gets
a total of £4. He divides that by two and sub-
tracts what he has put on, namely £l. He is thus
credited by the bookie with £l. And yet if his
horse had 'won alone he would have got £3. As in
the cash betting case he has, of course, lost half his
bet, which is what brings his return down from
the 30s. which he might have looked for since his
horse half won the race, to a paltry quid.
Concession betting vanished in N. S. Wales with
the arrival of the tote. But when it flourished, and
dead-heats occurred, things were liable to become
very complicated. The writer knew one man who
laid two to one in hundreds on a horse_ which dead-
heated with a six to one chance. Under the con-
vention stated above he was debited with £5O,
while the co-winner paid, to the same stakes, £350.
Meanwhile the backers of the second and third horses
had their money returned. Soultline started in India
once at 10 to one on. His supporters, who had
backed him on a sovereign basis —ready-money bet-
ting—collected £5 10s. apiece. That is to say,
though they had spotted the winner, they left
£4 10s. each with Mac Noses.
Still, it has to be admitted that the argument of
Wren’s officials is far-fetched. There is not a possi-
bility in a million of a fortune-hunter being able to
avoid a ruinous half-win in favor of an innocuous
second or third. Nobody could bring off such a
coup but the rider, and unless his judgment was
supernatural he might be sacrificing a rich win in
his dishonest effort to play for safety. As regards
actual place-betting the dead-heat convention does
not, of course, affect it one way or the other. The
punter is paid either a quarter of the odds at the
price .at which he made the bet, or a quarter of the
starting-price odds, and that is all about it.

An original feature of the last Victoria
Park (South Aus.) race meeting was a bush fire in
the enclosure. The sport of kings was allowed to
slide temporarilv. while fire-fighters grabbed bags
and attacked the. conflagration. The betting was
two to one on and no, takers at one time in favor
of the enclosure fence going. During the Tramway
Trial smoke so veiled the course that it was impos-
sible to see the horses.

The local trainer does little financial
good for himself out of his apprentices. He has
to teach the boys their profession and house and
feed them. He has to collect their riding fees and
bank them in a trhst account; and none of the
money can be used, either by the apprentice or by
the trainer, without a permit from the racing authori-
ties. After the first 12 months the boys get a rise in
wages. The only return the trainer gets for his
composite job of boarding-house keeper, manager,
secretary and trustee, is that the lad, when required,
rides free for him. Not for his patrons—only for
the trainer. If an apprentice is offered a ride at
some meeting which involves a train journey, the
trainer has either to finance him or to deny the
boy his chance. The financing isn’t merely a matter
of the railway fare —-it may include all sorts of
details from Turkish baths to presentable, clothes
for the occasion. In MX. half the apprentice’s
fees are banked and the master takes the other half
for his trouble. It seems, anyhow, a fair thing
that, after 50 per cent, of a boy’s earnings have
been put to a trust account, 35 per cent, (say)
should go to the apprentice and the other 15 per
cent, to the trainer.

“Non-bettor” : Re your estimate of pre-
sent-day Australiafc riding form. That McLachlan
is a master horseman no one will deny. He is a
consummate judge of pace and in a long-distance
race none excels him. But during the last few years
he has not ridden with marked success. Albert Wood,
on the .other hand, has in the same period been
always ' He 'won the last two Newmarkets,
the last Epsom, the Villiers, the Challenge Stakes
and the Anniversary. AVhen Cetigne won the Craven
Plate from the best field that ever competed, it was/
Wood’s great finish that enabled him to rush Cetigne
forward at the last moment and defeat Wolaroi, Est-
land and Desert Gold in record time. On Kennaqu-
hair in the Fisher Plate, he downed Magpie and
Wolaroi because he rode a masterly race and kept
his horse ahead from start to finish over the mile and
a' half. If there are any palms for, jockeyship. going
round it is Albert Wood who merits the first of them.
And there are others. Connell has now ridden just
on a thousand winners, and in Queensland his success
year' after year is phenomenal. Of course he is
essentially a short-distance jockey. Very shrewd was
the way in which he brought the 20 to one chance
Woorawa along at the end of the Rosehill Guineas,
and downed the three to one on favorite Finmark.
Then we have Dempsey, who was hailed as one of the
greatest jockeys in the world after winning the
Caulfield Cup on Bronzetti. He is probably the
best lightweight jockey in Australia. There are good
judges who consider L. A. Walker, of Sydney, as
good as any. Again take Bracken. He can ride
at a light weight, he is very strong and over short
distances is an undoubted champion. Even up to a
mile and a half he has few equals and no superior.
There was no one better than Lillyman for sprint
races a few seasons ago, and he is sure to come again.
As a matter of fact the Australian turf is well off at
present in first-class riders; better far on all the evi-
dence than England. The whole world of Australian
jockeydom does not rest on McLachlan’s shoulders,
though Mac’s list of Cup victories is probably unique
in the history of racing.

Apropos a par a fortnight ago about
cricketing Major Moyes, who would “not need a pad
on his left leg again.” There are two Major Moyes;
it’s the other one (a son-in-law, by the way, of the
B.’s old editor, James Edmond) who has lost a leg.
Curiously the cricketing Moyes nearly had the same
experience. “There was a chance that I’d lose my
left leg a couple of years ago,” he writes, “but it’s
all right now, and I’ve had a pad on it many times
since then.”
The recent N. S. Wales v. Vic. cricket
match was the 97th in which these States have
clashed. Ma has won 55 of them.
Left-hander J. Bogle (’Varsity), who
smote 145 in the big game v. Victoria, is among
the very few who have notched a century in their
first inter-State appearance. Although little more
than a youth, his coolness disconcerts bowlers
almost as much as his skill and staying power.
In the effort v. Victoria, he swung the bat for
five hours and 25 minutes, and his 957 runs in
all matches is easily the feature of the season’s
cricket.
* * * *
Tommy Andrews, of N. S. Wales, is a
useful all-rounder. In the recent big match, be-
sides his 112 not out, he upset five wickets for
110. On Saturday, he made 107 v. Balmain; and
he has a batting average of 40.41, and a bowling-
one of *15.05 to date. He plays for Petersham.
Billy Sewart and B. A. Onyons—both
of Victoria—were the only Billjims among the 22
men who pulled on flannels in the recent inter-State
cricket match at Sydney.

The inter-State cricket conference at
Sydney decided to hand the Sheffield Shield to the
State with the best record in the two seasons be-
ginning- at the end of 1919. The passing of the
shield will leave room for the Australian Board
of Control to hang up an Australian emblem for
the States to fight for.

“Machete”: The football scheme of num-
bering the players would make cricket a lot more
interesting to many onlookers unlearned in the per-
sonalities of the game. And it wouldn’t even
outrage good old tradition. When H. 11. Stephen-
son’s first team visited Australia the men were dis-
tinguishable by the colors of their caps.

The pug is one of the minor martyrs of
the ’flu. With the armistice it seemed that a
brighter day was dawning for his profession. He
proceeded to engage training quarters and hire
sparring partners, managers, secretaries and so on.
Now ihe game is dead again, and the horrified
assault-, id-battery expert is faced with a possible
reversion to pick-and-shovel work. Country fishing-
centres are also hard hit. They exist by selling the
city visitor bait, beer, fruit, more beer, fishing lines
and hooks and further beer, and by hiring out skiffs
and launches and supplying enormous quantities of
beer to put in them. Most of the nlaces now fear
the Melbourne or Sydney tripper more than they love
his money, and stagnation is beginning to brood over
them.

“Gerardy”: Probably the best Australian
lightweight in Palestine is Mick Rutherford, well
known in Cobar (N.S.W.). Since he came abroad
Mick has had over 30 glove fights and has failed
only twice. Always on the alert for a match, he
has met a few of England’s best, notably Sergfc.
Morey Stone, and Charlie Webb, of London. He
also held the Camel Brigade’s light and welter-
weight championships, which he won at El Arish.
* * * *
Jess Willard, the giant who wore down
Jack Johnson after the black had beaten him on
points, and who by sheer weight of meat secured
the heavyweight championship of the world, intends
to defend his title. Tex Rickard, according to a
cable, is arranging a match for him with either
Carpentier or Jack Dempsey. It is doubtful -r Car-
pentier would draw. He would be giving away
nearly sst. in weight and over half-a-foot in height.
Also he would have to “come back” after four years
in a back-area camp. Not one boxer in a hundred
could do it.

There was a white procession up and
down Sydney Harbor last Saturday when Mavis
(N.S.W.), sailed by F. W. Moppett, won. the Aus-
tralian Championship. Mascbtte (N.S.W.) followed
her home 42 seconds later, skippered by W J. Dun-
can, and Desdemona (also N.S.W.) blew in third,
eight seconds later, with A., C. Roberts at the tiller.
Thelma 11., the fancied Bananaland champion,
struggled in fourth. Mavis was first away and soon
-it; was merely ,a struggle between the other . seven
boats for second and third money. The race, viewed
from the hills, was one to make the watcher catch
his breath.. Besides the three leaning ferry steamers,
■black with barrackers, there were between 60 and'7o
yachts, tugs and motor-launches streaming along
behind the competitors. It was a wonderful sea
pageant and: the interference caused by the fleet of
pursuers -must have made the racing skippers say
“Blow!” or even “Dash!” But not one sizzling
word reached the hillside watcher. To him at least
it was a thing of silent beauty. Svdney had seen
nothing like it since 1914.

Great were the results of the recent
N. S. Wales public school vacation swimming'
venture. Altogether 3580 children ;gained efficiency
—92 per cent, of girls and 88 per cent: of boys.
Bigger teaching staffs and compulsory life-saving
classes are foreshadowed next season.

One of the unwritten laws of the Sydney
beaches is that no gentleman shall duck a lady to
whom he hasn’t been introduced. Owing to the
excitement caused by the peace this statute has been
rather neglected of late, and various copious fights
have ensued. The drawback about a fight in the water
is that the gentleman who is down taking the count
may suffocate, especially if he is a short-winded
gentleman.
In N. S. Wales singles bowls championship
last week J. Wright (Marrickville), out-distanced
Donaldson (Killara) by 31—16. Yet Donaldson had
fine wins over Stewart (21 —8 in the fifth found)
and P. B. Colquhoun (31 —24 in the semi-final).
Le .Cornu, of the Adelaide Bowling Club,
and formerly champion of South Parks, has won the
S. Aus. metropolitan championship. He is a con-
sistent performer, having been runner-up,: once -and
in the semi-final four times. Beale, the second man,
is the Oval Club champion; till three or four years
ago he was a mighty bowler in Geelong.
Last week France blew in an early
challenge of Australasia’s right to hold the Davis
Cup—the outward and visible sign of the world’s
tennis championship. Norman Brookes and
Anthony F. Wilding (since killed in Flanders) won
the utensil on behalf .of Australasia in before-war
days. America and Great Britain are also possible
challengers.
“Sarto”: Albury’s tote record (the
machine operated on only two of 12 events) has
been beaten by South Grafton. One ticket was taken
out there on a recent first day’s racing of six events;
and none on the second day when five events were
contested. The lonely investor got Bs. 6d. back for
his ten bob, and the machine earned Is. 6d.

Gloaming, which cost G. D. Gre> nwood
230 guineas as a yearling, has won just on 1.9000
in stakes in six months’ racing.
J. Casey, who laid the odds in Melbourne
and Sydney in the long ago, has just died in Ireland,
leaving He was one of the few wealthv
Hibernian patriots to settle down in his native land.
There is renewed talk of a meeting be-
tween Biplane and Desert Gold. At w.f.a. Desert
Gold (six years) would carry Bst. 111 b., as against
9st. by Biplane (four years), and some such event
as the' Essendon Stakes (10 furlongs') is usually men-
tioned. There are a number of suitable A.J.C. and
V.R.C. events, provided the influenza doesn’t last long
enough to ruin the Autumn racing seasons. A
straight-out match would, of course, be more satis-
factory to everyone but the owners, who are not
likely to forego the chance of collecting the stake-
money—which in the Essendon is £lOOO. Biplane
has scored 10 wins in 17 attempts to date, and Desert
Gold 34 out of 50.
At Wagga (N.S.W.) last week the duck-
shooting season opened. A returned soldier, to quote
a daily paper report, “had a shot at some ducks and
thought both barrels had exploded. Soon after get-
ting into a boat, and placing the gun in the boat
with the hammer cocked, the second charge went off.”
With the result that the soldier had a considerable
amount of his arm blown off. Any man who monkeys,
about boats, cars or other wheeled conveyances,' or
who gets over or through fences, with hammer-guns
cocked, or with hammerless ones off the “safe,”
deserves something with boiling oil in it. Another
public danger is the eager person who tears ahead
with his weapon on his shoulder—upside down. The
effect is that the barrels are on the same alignment
as his companions’ heads. If every shooting party
made a rule that any member who failed to “break”
his gun before getting into a boat, car or buggy
should pay a fixed sum to a specified charitv. there
would be a big saving in useful lives. Further
causes of death or disablement are the idiot who
shoots “down the line” at hare, or rabbit drives,
and his prototype who gets on his horse or sits
down to lunch without first unloading his gun.
The Maori Rugby football team, formed
by Lieut. Booth from the M.L. war ranks to tour
Wales next month, is the second native combination
to play on the fields of the United Kingdom (doubt-
less this XV will play elsewhere than in Wales).
The first crowd toured England in 1888-9, played
74 matches, won 49, lost 20 and even-scored five.
Points, 394 against 188.

' Adelaide, which suppressed athletics dur-
ing the war more firmly than anv other capital, is
busy gathering up the loose strings. The recent
cricket-match with Victoria was undertaken on very
little practice, and there is to be a return. The
“Patriotic Association,” which kept some football
"oing, is quietly fading out, and the League has
secured for next winter all the ovals about the city.
Lacrosse, which has a big following in Adelaide, is
to start again at the same time, and the Lawn
Tennis Assoc, announces a tournament for March.

Theo. McCausland Stewart, who arrived
lately to play in “The Better ’Ole,” is an old
cricketer of some note. He was eapiain of the
XI of Foyle College, Londonderry, back in 1880,
and in 1887 was a member of the Carlton XI, Syd-
ney, when Percy Macdonell was captain.

Leichhardt (Sydney) Pleasant Sunday
Afternoon Club had a visitor from Nymagee at its
meeting the other day. A tramp carrving the regu-
lation swag and billy dropped in casually on the two-
up class and fell into dissertation on flies, ’flu,
barcoo rqt, and such things. The “school” went on.
Then the ’tecs came into the distance, and while
some flew for safety others varned about theology
and whether Pearce is enjoying his trip. That was
Part 1. The curtain went up on Part 2 showing the
tramp to be a well-done-up D. Part 3 was staged
at, a police court, when 14 players paid in £2
each. Tt was .the fact of being caught so simply
that cut deepest, and the next tramp who happens
along will wonder why he isn’t popular.
Hunting, which is the most character-
istically British sport when all is said and done,
has re-started, in the United Kingdom. But under
what altered 1 conditions ! J The pasture-land is nearly
all gone. Even the great parks where hounds used
to meet. are ploughed up in many cases. Outside
“the Shires” the allotment cultivators have got to
work, and there is hardly room to walk, much less
gallop, between the patches. The woodland country
of Hampshire remains more or less unchanged, and
so of course is the moorland, over which the Devon
and Somerset pack has been running for genera-
tions. (But Devon is suffering from an epidemic
of rabies, so hunting is barred there, anyhow.) The
effect of the altered conditions should be to simplify
the sport—to bring it back to where it stood a
century ago. The huge hunting trains that used
to pull in and out of places like Rugby, with their
elaborate meals and their legion of retainers, may
go. The 500-guinea, galloper will vanish. People
will huht once morfe from the vicinity of their own
front doors. The “thruster” will, perhaps for the
first time in his life, get a chance to see the hoqnds
work, which is the nominal end of all hunting.'
LINES CONCERNING AN UNPRECEDENTED
IMPORTATION OF HALOES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. C. A. Sims, the Y.M.C.A. representative, who
travelled back to Australia on the Port Hacking,
said: “The religious parades were always well
attended, although they were voluntary. On Sunday
afternoons we had discussions. Most of the men
were deeplv religious. At the services they would
remain till 10 o’clock at night, asking questions
relative to religion and questions of conscience and
conduct.” —S. M. llrrald.
The good old Port Hack, on its ultimate trip
Brought homo a remarkable crowd.
No poker or liousey occurred on the ship:
The national game —which is played with a kip •
They neither desired nor allowed.
All they asked as the transport plugged slowly along
Were revivalist meetings for sermon and song.
The things less religious troops did ! Well, folks say
That some used to callously fight -
Re-acting the horrors of Rushcutter’s Bay,
Where pugilists batter each other all day
And also far into the night.
Here but one was assailed when the lads met on deck:
Viz: The Devil —and he got it hard in the neck.
No sneers at the food darkened any Report;
Cold “bully” was greeted with joy ;
The fish might be high and the margarine short,
The bread only fit to be bunged through a port;
Such trifles all failed to annoy.
For three-fourths of the soldiers —deploring their
past—■
Expiated their sins by a rigorous fast.
They prayed at “Revally” and “Officers’ Call,”
“Boat Stations,” “Assembly,” “Dismiss”
And “Lights Out” —and then they arose, one and all,
And each sought his own little hammock or stall,
And slept, in regenerate bliss.
Do you wonder the public amazedly paints
Such a crowd, not as Diggers, but Latter Day Saints?

There is a Way to Perfect
Health!
That way is open to YOU. Will you travel it ?
The only way to improve Nature is through natural
methods.
Drugs and apparatus usually show no results, and are often
injurious. Under my method fifteen minutes each day in
your own room are sufficient. I have thousands of students
in all parts of Australia and New Zealand who are now
enjoying good health. Previously a large number of these
people were sufferers from indigestion, constipation and
other disorders which are the direct result of the internal
muscles being much below normal.
My exercises pay particular attention to the muscles that
govern the action of the stomach, liver and bowels, and
quickly bring them back to a healthy state again.
Surely you wart to enjoy the best of health? Then why
not write to-day for full particulars of my
Postal Course of Health and Strength Culture?
This is proof of what I say:—
“Dear Sir, —I am getting along splendidly with my
exercises. My weight has increased 151 b., chest expan-
sion llin., waist lfin., calf fin., forearm -Jin., neck
lin. “(Signed) J. 8., Bodangora, N.S.W.”
Many hundreds of letters from pupils all over Australia and
New Zealand are in the same strain.
I should like vou to have mv booklet, “HEALTH AND
STRENGTH FROM SELF-CULTURE,” which tells about
my methods, fees, etc. Just write your name and address
across this ad. and send it to me, with three penny stamps
for postage.

Extract from the Australian Morning
Star (21/2/’23) :
Yesterday, at the Central Police Court, John
Smith, deceased, aged 3, was charged that on the
previous day he did, with malice, allow himself to
be killed by a motor-car driven by William Brown.
Traffic-officer Johnson stated that the car was travel-
ling well within the speed limit of 90 miles an
hour. Accused was playing “tig” with several other
suspected persons. He (witness) spoke to accused,
but, receiving no answer, concluded that he was dead.
At this stage William Brown was allowed to give
evidence in order that he might get away to an
important billiard tournament. He swore that the
accused had more than once narrowly escaped being
run over. At the corner where the car was bumped
there had been repeated trouble to himself and
many other travellers. It was time that something
should be done.
Police-sergeant Ogreson informed the Bench that
accused had had several warnings. His left leg had
been torn off some time ago by a motor-car that
he had interfered with. The police were powerless
against these organised bands.
The magistrate found accused guilty and ordered
him to be buried with costs.

Always glad to see Outback stuff like that. Will
use that motor-trip story in some form Bellerive:
This one ought to put Moses McShortodds on the
rocks: —
A youthful defaulter turned
The key in he’s door;
He’d gambled the money
And feared the stern law.
Unable the ordeal of a
Court trial to face,
To and fro in despair
He’s room he did pace.
When the police broketh in,
The culprit lay dead,
With a pistol in hand and a
Bullet in he’s head.
He’d plunged at the races
Thinking to win.
And such was the end
Of he’s reckless sin.

Stopain Toothache Gum
Instantly Ends The Ache
And Helps Save The Tooth.
Don’t put up with toothache a minute. You
don’t have to. Just put a little piece of Stopain
Toothache Gum in the cavity, or around the
tooth and all pain is gone as if by magic.
U
Let STOPAIN Stop That Boring Pain.
It fills up the cavity, excluding the air, and
stopping the mouth acids from acting on the
frantic, jumping nerve; hardens quickly, and
forms a serviceable filling that will last for a
long time—until you are ready to have a per-
manent filling put in.
Why punish yourself ? Why endure the
agony of toothache when a shilling box of
Stopain Toothache Gum will quickly restore
your peace of mind ?
Keep it on hand for emergencies.
Stopain Toothache Gum is sold by most
medicine vendors at a shilling a box, or sent

Shortness of breath is not always heart trouble. In nine cases out
of ten it’s the stomach, and the only safe and certain medicine for it is that
curative remedy for all digestive disorders—Chamberlains Tablets for the
stomach and liver.
Chamberlain’s Tablets are a pleasant tonic laxative and a perfect
remedy for shortness of breath, indigestion, biliousness, heartburn, palpitation,
and liver and bowel troubles. They are specially good for women and
children.
Chamberlains Tablets do the work whenever you require their aid—
they change weakness into strength—listlessness into energy—gloominess into
joyousness.
You may have tried this, that, or the other, but for permanent
relief and pleasurable action you will never find anything to equal

Diarrhoea.
Diarrhoea attacks all ages, and is equally
fatal to young and old. The great danger in
this disease is due to the frequent lack of
proper treatment in the first stages. Chamber-
lain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy is a reliable
and effective medicine, and if given in time
will prevent serious results. It never fails, and
is pleasant to take. Every household should
have a bottle on hand. Get it today. Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy taken at
the first unusual looseness of the bowels will
save suffering and anxiety—and loss of both
ime and money.
Take It With You.
The importance of having a bottle of Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy with
them is realised by experienced travellers, as
this medicine cannot be bought on the train or
steamship. Change of water and diet often
deranges tte stomach and bowels and produces
diarrhoea. As Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy is the most reliable medicine
in use for these ailments, care should be taken
to have a bottle always on hand. Attacks of
trouble nearly always come on suddenly
ana when 'his remedy is at hand all danger
ijtay be avoided.
Be Firm.
When you ask for a bottle of Chamberlain’s
Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy, do not be per-
suaded to take anything else. Be firm in your
conviction that there is nothing so good. This
medicine has been tested in the most severe
cases of cramp, colic, dysen'ery and diarrhoea,
and has never been known to fail. “ Can be
depended upon” is an expression always used
in connection with Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy. One bottle goes a long
way towards relieving suffering humanity. It
never fails to give immediate and permanent
relief.

An irreverent London editor lias asked:
“Does Mr. William Hughes really believe

“303”: Uncle Sam’s discovery of that
little list of folk “useful to Germany,” is a
reminder that we’ve heard nothing of any
demand upon Hunland for names (with
some proofs) of similar vermin in Australia,
imported and home-grown. Why not make
it a peace condition? Another little list
wouldn’t do us any harm.
Now that active campaigning is over,
these are the goods called for by the Red
Cross for England, Egypt and France: deck
shoes, preserved fruits, fresh linen and soap,
jolly tablets, fans, magazines and tobacco.
All the same, whether strafing the Hun or
not, the boys still want socks ; and a plain-
tive cry rolled into The Bulletin office
last week from an officer that his lot’s toes
were all poking through. And it was
beastly cold.
From one of Cap’ll Hancock’s boys:—
Apropos The Bulletin's true stories of the influ-
ence of just-dead Cap'n Hancock at Moonta and
Wallaroo, and the fact that there hasn’t been any
industrial trouble there for 25 years. Barwell, S.A.
Minister for Industry, has recently visited the Penin-
sula to get at the bottom of it ,all. He thinks the
co.’s “betterment” work is responsible. The move-
ment has regard for the physical, moral, and mental
welfare of the worker, and makes for efficiency,
loyalty and contentment. The work includes atten-
tion to housing, education and recreation, and pro-
vision is made for accident, sickness and medical
funds. In addition the practises a form
of profit-sharing. The minimum . rate is fixed as a
living wage and provision is made for a sliding-
scale of bonuses based on the price of copper. Occa-
sionally somebody turns up who bids Moonta arise
and shake off its wage-chains, and assures all hands
that the good boss is the working class’s worst
enemy; but always a ribald Cousin Jack tells him
to stop his “craik” and be off with ’ee.
“Werrimee” : I hail the proposed establish-
ment of a tin-plate industry at Newcastle
with great joy; at the same time I can’t
help regretting the enormous pre-war wastage
of tins that is about to be resumed. Dur-
ing the war, which put restrictions
on new supplies, the old supplies, including
blacking and polish tins, were salvaged at
a price, and the scenery was much tidier.
The shopkeeper, when selling the goods,
charged a penny for the tin, and paid a
ha’penny for it when it was brought back,
which was economy or worse. I’m sure
he’ll miss that, ha’penny. As soon as
the armistice was signed, manufacturers ad-
vertised that they did not want the empties
any more. Even treacle, syrup and honey
tins became unsaleable. Why? The cus-
tomers are still paying for them, and it is
wanton extravagance to throw the good
material away.
“G. 8.” : Jamaica converts its molasses
into spirit for the manufacture of blended
rum, which the Federal Government allows
into the Commonwealth at 255. per proof-
gallon duty. But similar spirit, distilled
from _ the same by-product, and manufac-
tured in Australia by Australians, would have
to pay 355. per proof-gallon duty before it
could be cleared from bond. The market
value of imported blended rum in Govern-
ment bond is 12s. 6d. per proof-gallon, plus
the duty 255., totalling 375. 6d. For White
Australian blended rum to compete with this
black-labor product, it would have to sell at
2s. 6d. per proof-gallon in bond. There are
times when the “National” Government
loves Australia so much that it actually
offers the colored foreigner a bonus.
The politicians, fierce and stout,
At all our earnings grab.
The State coach that we read about
Is now a taxi-cab!
“Wandi”; One of the great conveniences
of far-out is the travelling saddler. He pur-
sues trade in a covered vehicle, which is a
combined workshop and leather-goods empor-
ium. Generally he has a home and shop in
some little town and goes on the road in
slack times. Besides picking up odd jobs on
the way, he finds grist for the mill at big
sheds and distant homesteads. Boot-repair-
ing is a part of his trade, and nearly every
camp _ has something for him in that line,
for his are carried on far from
permanent shops. His round sometimes occu-
pies half a year, and in his absence work
accumulates at home that helps him to keep
busy during the other half. In this way
a tradesman does a good regular business in
a thinly-populated centre where a stranger
would hardly expect him to get enough to
pay his grocery bill.
“Gleniris”: The pitiable poultry-raiser
still gets it in the neck. Some of the most
desirable stock ever seen by this writer were
raised by women, after years of careful work.
It is essentially a woman’s industry, and
these girls, with thousands of others, have
had to contend with a blighting succession
of handicaps. Of recent years, the worst
bump was the outbreak of war. Others
have been dry seasons and dear feed, wet
seasons and the liability of stock to dozens
of damp-weather diseases, the general neces-
sity for buying feed at higher-than-wholesale
rates while marketing the produce of the
industry at wholesale-only prices (a most
unsound system which the State has made
practically no attempt to improve) and one
thing after another in small disabilities.
For instance, it is now alleged that, though
it was possible for poultry-people to buy
grain from the Wheat Board’s stacks in
10-bag lots, the minimum now stands at
50-bag lots. Wherefore, except in the case
of the large poultry-raiser, who is nearly as
scarce as the 7-egg-per-week hen, the
poultrist has to buy through the middleman.
There ought to be a good living in the
business for anybody who puts in eight hours
a day. There isn’t, however, and the
Government knows that there isn’t, under
present conditions. Yet departments of
Agriculture continue, at considerable ex-
pense, to “educate” people in egg-farming,
while taking but a casual interest in the
poultry-person’s feed-facilities, the most
vital matter in the whole business.

Install a Daspyl Bath Heater
AMONGST modern home conveniences a prominent place is
allotted the “Daspyl” Bath Heater.
Apart from its premier purpose of supplying a hot or tepid
bath at a moment’s notice, think of its other uses —steaming hot
water for any household purpose, without waiting, without fuss or
mess, without trouble, and at an infinitesimal cost.
The “Daspyl" Bath Heater has many advantages, amongst
which are: —No. I—The Regulating Water Tap. No. 2-—The
Safety Gas Tap, that cannot be turned on till No. 1 is on.
No. 3 —-A second Safety Gas Tap that completely cuts off the
supply when the Heater is not in use, as shown in the illustra-
tion. It is handsome, easily fixed, easily operated, and never-
failing in its efficiency. Install the “Daspyl” and you save

ZORA CROSS.
The Salving of Bucko Jix.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was a beastly uiglit to be out in, blow-
ing half a gale off-sliore, and raining
as it never rained before the Flood. As
I battled up the hill above Miller’s Point I
cursed the business that had kept me out so
late, and looked about for a pub. I dived
into the parlor of the first I struck, and
fiercely demanded hot grog.
When I had gulped it I became civilised
enough to say good-night to the three men
who were sitting over pipes and glasses at
a table before a hissing coal fire.
’Longshore men, 1 judged ; a hard-handed,
tough-headed company, but pleasant enough
now in that congenial environment of
tobacco and grog and yarns-about.
I paid my footing with a hot nobbier
apiece, and at once was admitted into the
inner circle. A little, cross-eyed fellow took
up his yarn where my entrance had inter-
rupted it, and when he had finished someone
said:
“By c-ripes, dot vos a glose shave, for
sure!”
I turned to the interjector, and found my-
self looking at one of those big, blonde, blue-
eyed men you instantly class as a Dutch-
man, though probably he was a Swede or a
Dane. His immense chest, where it showed
through his open shirt, was hairy as a
gorilla’s, and his bare, tattooed arms might
have served at a pinch as a battle-ship’s
piston rods. Yet with all his evident strength
he seemed a good-humored ruffian, and I
found myself rather liking him before the
evening ended.
“Dot yarn of Bob’s,” he was saying, “yos
remind me”
“Right-oh, Jan; let’s have it,” said the
cross-eyed romancer.
And —I have tried to straighten out the
narrator’s English—lie let us have it some-
thing like this.
I was fairly on my beam-ends in ’Frisco,
or I don’t think I’d have signed articles
aboard that schooner. The Sally K. Boomer,
she was, bound for Sydney with general
cargo, and a well-found craft as Yankee
windjammers of those days went.
But I didn’t like her afterguard, and that’s
the fact. I had heard about ’em, you see.
Every sailorman who ever got drunk in a
'Frisco saloon had heard about ’em, and
never heard any good.
The Old Man was a drunken sot, who left
everything possible to the mate; and the
mate....
He broke off and sipped his grog.
Ever heard of Bucko Jix? No? Well,
Bucko was mate of the Sally Iv. Boomer,
and that would liave been enough for me,
only, as I have said, I was on my beam-
ends ; the old Sally was the only hooker
handy; and I just had to get an advance
note from somewhere.
Bucko Jix was about the toughest devil
that ever broke a poor sailorman’s jaw.
Fists and boots and belaying pins, with pis-
tols to back ’em up—these were the bill o’
fare wherever Bucko trod the after-deck.
Afraid of him? No, I wasn’t afraid of
him; I was a bigger man than he was, and
I knew that in a fair go I could pound him
rail-under. But the afterguard has all the
best of it. and I wasn’t hankering for dirt
among the lawyers when I got to Sydney, so
I made up my mind to give Bucko as wide
a berth as possible. I managed to do it
fairly well, too, until....
lie stopped to relight his pipe.
Until we were about a week out of Syd-
ney. It was a coldish, moonless night, but
clear and full of stars, with a good capful
of wind from the right quarter. I had just
finished my trick at the wheel and was go-
ing for’ard to turn in.
As I passed the galley I thought I heard
voices, indistinct in the roar of the canvas.
I stopped and peered. Sure enough there
in the lee of the galley were two men with
their heads close together, as if they didn’t
exactly want all hands to. wake up and
listen.
There was enough starlight - to show me
"ho they were: Bucko Jix and a foremast
hand, named Itevel. Polish Jew, or perhaps
Russian Jew, he was, and a shipmate I
somehow couldn’t take to. Found out after-
wards that he had a brother in Sydney in
the old junk and ship’s chandlery business
on the outside; “fence,” on the inside.
Savvy?
It struck me as funny to see the mate con-
fabbing so familiar-like with a fo’m'st hand,
especially cuddled up against the galley at
that time o’ night. But what I overheard
sti uck me as still funnier, and puzzled me
for days after. The mate was speaking:
“Stuff ashore.... easy.... dollars.”
Just then Bucko saw me and roared like
a mad grizzly:
“What the hell are you doin’ here, you
squab-faced Dutchman! Get for’ard, or by
I made a dive for it into the fo’c s le, but
I didn’t sleep that night for puzzling about
that scrap of conversation I had heard. I
puzzled all next day, and was still puzzling
when my wheel-trick came next night. I
was leaning over the. spokes, not taking
much notice of anything, when:
“Goin’ nicely, eh, Jan?”
It was Bucko, and as nice as a gent, in a
play. It fairly knocked me rail-under, and
that’s the fact.
Bucko took a couple of turns, stopped,
and said quite friendly-like:
“If this breeze holds we’ll make Sydney
in fine time, and then to paint the old town
red, eh, Jan, my son?”
I couldn’t Speak for surprise. The mate
went on:
“Queer, isn’t it, how you meet people at
sea? There’s Revel, for’ard, now. Cousin
o’ ray wife’s, an’ I didn’t recognise him till
I ran bows-on into him near the galley
last night. We had a yarn ’bout old times,
I can tell you.”
“Aha!” I thought, tumbling to his game.
“You’re trying to pump out of me how much
I overheard last night, aren’t you, Bucko?
Afraid I heard too much, aren’t you? But
it won’t come off, Jixey—-it won’t come off.”
So I pretended to swallow the wife’s
cousin yarn, and Bucko went off in a little
while. But I knew he still suspected me,
for I caught his eye as he turned to go. And
if ever there was murder in a man’s eye it
was in the mate’s just then.
I knew I’d have to watch out, or I’d never
see ’Frisco again.
But 'idiot had Bucko meant by “stuff
ashore. . . .easy. . . .dollars”?
* * * ■*
In Sydney we berthed alongside a jetty
in Blackwattle Bay, and began to rip the
cargo out of her. Discipline went all to
smash as soon as we had berthed. The
skipper vamoosed as far as the ship was
concerned ; if he wasn’t drunk in his berth
he was drunk ashore —anyhow, we seldom
clapped eyes on him. Bucko kept the crew
a little shipshape during the day, but at
night he didn’t seem to care a cent what
•they did. Consequence was that as soon as
it was too dark to work most of ’em made
ashore to the pubs, and came back to meet
Bucko’s boot half-seas-over in the morning.
I happened to be on the water-waggon just
then, and always slept aboard.
It must have been the third or fourth
night that something seemed to wake me,
yet when I sat up in my bunk and listened
I couldn’t hear anything unusual. I could
have sworn, though, that in my sleep I had
heard a thump, thump, thump somewhere
close handy. “Must ha’ been a dream,” I
thought, and went to sleep again.
But next night there it was, thump,
thump, tliump! “No doubt about you this
time,” says I, and in a jiff I was quietly up
the fo’c's’le ladder, poking my head above
deck. The dim light from a shore lamp showed
me three things: the forehatch was open;
Bucko and Revel were leaning over the
rail; and a lighter was just putting off
from the side of the Sally. It was the
bumping of that lighter, or something being
loaded into her, that had made that thump,
thump, thump.
I slipped back to my bunk, and whistled to
myself. So that’s you game, Bucko! steal-
ing cargo, eh? Note I-understand the talk
by the galley.
I lay awake till daylight, pondering where
I came into the business.
Next night I didn’t go to sleep, and the
instant I heard a stir on deck I was up the
ladder.
A couple of yards from the scuttle I saw
Revel just in the act of lifting a big carpet
bag, of portmanteau. I never knew which
it was, and I never knew what was in it.
I’ll never know now, because it’s been lying
these good few years in the mud at the
bottom of Blackwattle Bay.
“Whacks!” I shouted, dived and grabbed
at the bag.
“Whacks, is it!” yelled Bucko—l hadn’t
noticed him in the dim light—and he caught
me a beauty square on the jaw.
Over the rail I went, bag and all, and
dropped down through the narrow space be-
tween the schooner’s side and the jetty.
When I came up 1 found myself in the
dark, half-drowned, and mucked-up among
the under-timbers of the jetty. I began to
swim, hitting my head and arms against
the timber. I don’t know how I got out
from under, but I did—on the side farthest
from the ship. I must have been nearly
fainting, for the first thing I remember was
a horrible, stabbing pain in the stomach.
I looked up, and there above me were the
stars, and the harbor lights, and Bucko
leaning over the jetty and dragging me up
with a boat-hook. Then I did faint.
“Saved your life, after all,” put in the
cross-eyed man.
Um ! you see, the point of the hook was
stuck in my stomach, and I had seen
Bucko’s eyes before I went off. Oh, yes.
he saved my life —but I guess it wasn’t his
fault that the hook didn’t go further in!
No. I wasn’t very much hurt; all right
in a week, in fact, barring a bandage round
the middle.
“You left the ship then?” I asked.
“Not just then. . . .The night before the old
Sally was putting to sea, homeward-bound
for ’Frisco, Bucko, who had been ashore,
was coming aboard. I could see from his
wobble that he was half-drunk. I strolled
casually forward and met him half way
down the jetty— and somehoiv Bucko tripped
and went over the planks!”
“Hell!” gasped Cross-eyes.
“Someone in the distance shouted: ‘Man
overboard !’ and then there was dead silence.
I looked down at Bucko; the tide was carry-
ing him out, and I knew from the way he
was splashing that he couldn’t swim. An-

-BUK.
The EVER-READY HOME HEALER.
THE fact that hundreds of nurses daily use Zam=Buk in the
course of their professional duties is further proof, if such
were needed, that in Zam=Buk the public is furnished
with a safe and reliable healing balm and skin=cure, the purity and
power of which cannot be denied.
Mrs. S. A. Somerville, a nurse, residing at 38 Wattle Street, Bendigo, Vic., writes :
“ For general use I have found Zam=Buk unsurpassed, and for the grandchildren when
falling and hurting themselves. One of these little ones, Gladys, had a cut on her
hand which festered, and it was very sore for some time. She came to me for treat-
ment and I dressed her hand, and the treatment with Zam=Buk soon took all the
inflammation away and healed the hand. For years 1 have been a nurse and have
had much experience with the use of Zam=Buk, and in all cases I have found it
splendid. For Piles I have experienced great relief, its soothing action allaying all
irritation and removing the congestion, giving great ease. My numerous patients
have found it very beneficial, and it is generally used in their homes.”

NURSE SMITH, of Underwood

“After extensive experience I can con-
fidently say that Zam-Buk is the best
healing balm I have ever used. In my
professional work I often have urgent
need of it, as, because of its great anti-
septic virtues, I find it unequalled for
use in cases where dangerous symptoms
threaten.
“Personally, I have used Zam-Buk for
a very severe burn on my hand. The
pain was excruciating, and having a
pot of Zam-Buk in the house, I smeared
the balm all over my hand. The burn-
ing pain was at once soothed, and in
a very short time my hand was quite
better.”

swung on his cap, ready to go home.
“I vos get him oud alife,” he replied,
quietly. “Und he gried like a bebby, and

P. T. FREEMAN.
The Deserter,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LIEtJT&NANT\SCHUBIN emerged from
his dugout And stood watching the
timber-laden procession of weary men
as they stumbled along the trench. Each
man, on catching a glimpse of the menacing
figure framed in the entrance, involuntarily
stiffened himself into a semblance of fierce
activity. After passing the first traverse the
pose automatically phased, and the long
swaying line relaxed once more into its for-
mer gait of leaden-footed misery. The last
man, through extreme fatigue, did not ob-
serve»the watching officer. As he came
abreast'of the dugout entrance big-humped
back and sagging knees provoked an irrita-*
ble snarl: “Quicker, fool —quicker!”
The lieutenant stopped out behind the
walking man, and, just before he reached
the traverse, thrust his foot violently against
the back of one of the shaking knees. The
man instantly collapsed into the mud. As
he fell, the log swung round off his shoulder
and one end struck the officer’s jaw. For ten
seconds the lieutenant was impotent with
rage. Then he commenced to kick the pros-
trate man savagely in the stomach. The
victim gasped with pain, drew his knees up
towards his chin, and rolled over on to his
back. “Excellent!” grunted the officer, and
his ironshod heel came down on the quiver-
ing lips.
A tall thin figure rounded the further
traverse and stared for a moment at the
stamping officer.
“Lieutenant!” came a harsh ejaculation,
and Captain Arndt strode along to the two
men. The lieutenant fumbled with the col-
lar of his jacket, and spat uneasily into the
mud.
“This dog struck me,” he said slowly. “I
was punishing him.”
“So !” commented the captain calmly, and
he whistled for the sei’geant.
“To the doctor!” he ordered, and pointed
downward. The sergeant saluted, hoisted the
unconscious man up on to his shoulder, and
disappeared round the traverse.
“But he” commenced the lieutenant,
stammering fvith indignation.
The captain looked straight into his eyes
with a dispassionate scrutiny that instantly
checked him.
“This is the second occasion, lieutenant,”
he said quietly. “The third will have a
painful outcome. Did you ever hear of the
Marquis de Sade? No? I thought not.
However, it does not matter. Do not forget
my warning.”
The lieutenant’s pride goaded him into
speech : “I must say”
“Silence!” interrupted the captain, lie
turned abruptly and walked away down the
trench. For two minutes the lieutenant
gnawed his finger-nails with passionate
energy; then he re-entered liis dugout.
Twenty-four hours later Lieutenant
Schubin, watch in hand, stood in the trench
amongst his men and awaited the vital
moment. For him the hour of five was to
have a double significance. His humiliation
of the previous day had ripened into the
poisonous fruit of cowardice, its growth
having been stimulated by twenty-four hours’
morbid introspection. He had carefully
packed his smaller valuables into his pockets
—the rest of the scheme depended upon
Chance and his own intelligence. At five
minutes to five he examined his automatic
pistol and addressed a last brief caution to
his sergeant. The air overhead throbbed and
hissed, and the staccato roaring that seemed
to beat backwards from the French trenches
infused fresh vigor into the waiting men.
The reply from the enemy guns was almost
trivial. Only two men in the trench had
been hit during half an hour.
■ The thrill of the signal and subsequent
hustling climb over the parapet conveyed no
vivid impression to the lieutenant. If any-
thing. lie felt much less interested than ever
before in the deadly stretch of open ground.
All at once, about fifty yards away, the
earth below the swirling fumes of the bom-
bardment bristled with moving figures, as
three bayonet-crested waves of men surged
up out of the French trenches into the open.
Even the guns seemed to hold their breath
expectantly. Then the opposing waves
smashed into each other.
Schubin was startled out of his mental in-
ertness by a charging figure, and only man-
aged to avoid a vicious stab in the abdomen
by a convulsive side-step. His attacker
tripped forward, overbalanced by his own
impetus, and the lieutenant shot him
through the skull before he struck the
ground. Just as he was turning, two curs-
ing men, locked in each other’s arms, crashed
into liis back. The three toppled over in a
heap, and the officer’s face was crushed into
the dirt by the weight above him. With
a terrible effort he was able to arch his back
a little and release his right arm which had
been squashed under his chest. Suddenly
he felt the body immediately next to his back
quiver violently for a second and then sag
down flaccidly. At the same instant a sharp
point dug into his flesh close to the spine.
Then he understood the sudden limpness, and
hastily twisting his right arm back, fired
blindly upward. The pressure on him les-
sened by half, and he slowly lifted his shoul-
ders sideways. The steel point stung him as
it tore itself free; then the bayoneted man
above slid over into tj*e mud.
As he lay quietly to recover his strength
he became aware that a hard and angular
object was hurting his left thigh. He put one
hand down cautiously and discovered that
lie was lying on his cigarette-case, which had
somehow twisted in his pocket. For a
moment its unusual presence strangely bewil-
dered him. Then an astounding recollection
burst through the superimposition of recent
perceptions, and the significance of his filled
pockets struck him like a blow. He stared
fixedly at a small ridge of blood-smeared mud
about six inches in front of his nose, and
tried to control liis rioting thoughts.
For five tumultuous minutes spirit and
flesh wrestled together, and the flesh weak-
ened rapidly. From the direction of the
French lines came an excited shouting that
abruptly swelled into a triumphant roar. The
German waves, after having almost crushed
the French back into their trenches, had
begun to surge in the centre. The lieutenant,
surprised by the uproar, levered himself up
on his elbows to see the cause. Just as he
was about to rise and rally his retreating
men, a huge running figure loomed up nearly
on top of him. He caught a fleeting glimpse
of a German uniform surmounted by a dis-
torted face, then a descending boot nearly
broke his spine....
Two hours afterwards he awakened into a
twilit desolation that heaved and surged
madly round his throbbing head. The
purpling zenith was streaked with flying stars
which dashed down into a drunken horizon
of naked, dancing trees. Upwards and
downwards swirled this frail atom of life
in a dreadful vertigo—up to the sun-
splashed. heights of ecstasy and down again
into the shuddering depths. At last the wild
swayings of the darkening earth died down
into a gentle rocking and the fainting man
began to revive. The jerking stars crept
back to cold, glistening fixity, and the de-
lirious world slept in peaceful exhaustion.
The lieutenant leaned on his elbow and
gazed wearily into the shadows. The silent
weight of the bayoneted man lay heavily
across his legs, and the ground about him
within the circle of distinctness was humped
and mounded with grotesque suggestion. The
surroundings depressed him intolerably.
Fifty yards to the right or left was the com-
panionship of the living, and the realisation
almost choked him. He leaned back, pushed
the dead man off his legs, and sat up. Away
over to the extreme left the horizon was
faintly silhouetted against the anaemic blur
of the fading light. He turned and com-
menced to crawl eastward, moving slowly
and quietly between the silent mounds.
All at once his grasping hands w r ent down
into vacancy and the over-balanced body
rolled into a shell crater. As he struck the
bottom something lurched out of the rotten
bank above and crashed into his arms. A
rifle banged deafeningly close to his head,
and the flash illuminated a familiar face.
Then the lieutenant heard Death whispering
in his ears, for his victim of the previous
clay had trapped him! With a frantic
effort he rolled over, clutching madly for the
throat. The next moment he got up on to
his feet and laughed nervously, for he knew
that he must have dislodged the dead man
from the bank by liis fall. He waited until
his breathing became normal, and then com-
menced to climb. When he was within two
feet of the edge his left foot slipped, and he
went down again into the dark on top of the
dead man. He rose up hurriedly and
shivered. There was an added element of
fatality in this second meeting that un-
nerved him. The thought began to obsess
him that the silent body was to companion
him throughout eternity. His self-control
died on the instant. He made a sudden rush
and clawed the crumbling slope like a fren-
zied cat. Upwards toward the star-flecked
sky scrambled the hysterical man, whilst
out of the depths came the vague, disquieting
noises of displaced earth. He reached the
top in a turbulence of emotion that u r as
almost delirium. The dominant idea still
unsubmerged by fear was to reach the French
trenches. He ran forward into ' the dark,
leaping and staggering in drunken alterna-
tions.
Abruptly he saw the pink glow of a
brazier floating upwards out of the ground
before him. In front of it was the black
edge of the parapet. He almost collapsed
with relief, and his joyful yell of “Kamerad!
Kamerad!” smothered the sentry’s chal-
lenge.
Six privates and an officer stared up in
astonishment at the figure with uplifted
arms that stood poised for a moment on the
sandbags. The swaying man suddenly stif-
fened and gaped into the trench.
“Swine!” snarled Captain Arndt, and his
. pistol spat upwards.

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

REFRIGERATING AND
ICE-MAKING MACHINERY.
While the Greatest Selling factor iu our machines is probably
their ECONOMY IN RUNNlNG—which is pertinent to the times
■ —their DEPENDABILITY counts a great deal for their
popularity. Even under the most severe conditions they can be
relied upon to give “CONSISTENT SERVICE.” Their strong
construction, and the great care taken in their manufacture is
the reason for this. Machines installed 25 years ago are still
at work to-day, giving the same seryice as when first installed.
We study your requirements and design the layout of your
plant, not only to accomplish a given result, but to do so with
au initial expenditure and maintenance cost. Our extensive
experience we place at your s^jyice.
