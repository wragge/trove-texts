We Have Come Out.
We have come out of the familiar places,
The gardens and the fields our fathers
knew,
Fled from their houses, from the graven
faces,
The shapen imagery of gods they
drew
From their deep, placid thought; for
tranquil wells
Were theirs, and the round order of
the years,
Seed germinant and stalk that slowly
swells
To the fruition of the heavy ears.
Have we grown wise ?
The visionary rapture in men’s eyes
Flames through the smoke. The dark
winds roar and beat,
The wild earth shakes. We walk with
stumbling feet,
And all the night is filled with anguished
cries.
We are not as they were —we that
tradition and the past disown.
We have deserted. Through the night
of pain
Are we to bondage or from bondage
flown ?
Our fathers’ house is empty and the
shape
Of things they knew forgotten. In the
skies
A pillar and a cloud. The tortured
breath
Is breath of battle. Is the vision death ?
The fathomless sea trackless behind us
lies,
Once only it divides —we may not pass
Again to far-left shores. The alien skies
Are ours, dried wells and withered grass.
And yearn we for the pastures, for the
rich corn lands,
For the water and the oxen and the Face
Our fathers imaged in their deathless
stones.
In the wind-wandering and lost drifting
sands
No form persists and no enduring grace,
No other monuments than bleaching
bones.
We rose up and went out from our place,
Yet we may hear rejoicing trumpets
blow
Triumphant on the walls of Jericho.

Women,
Novels and
Libraries
Of the innum-
era b 1 e literary
problems which
await the de-
velopment of an
adequate criticism
few tease me more than the curious
matter of Women and the Novel.
It is a problem with two phases which
are not as remote from one another as
they superficially seem: women as
writers of novels and women as readers
of novels. I am personally convinced
that we shall never understand the essen-
tial nature and possibilities of the form
until we understand its appeal to women
and its availability to them as an instru-
ment of expression and interpretation.
An obvious point of departure is that
women have a record of achievement in
the novel utterly beyond their achieve-
ment in any other branch of art (or of
science, for that matter). In music,
architecture, painting, in poetry, drama
belles-lettres generally, their achievement
is comparatively negligible; there are
only a few women of any consequence
and none of the first-rate. A Christina
Rossetti or an Alice Meynell has her
own small province, but no woman re-
motely approaches Shakspeare, Milton,
Dryden, Donne, Marlowe, Chaucer,
Racine, Goethe, Homer, Dante or any
of a hundred other poets or dramatists.
In our own day, with all the vaunted
possibilities opened to them, there is no
woman dramatist or poet of serious
achievement; and it is difficult to avoid
the conclusion that the great traditional
forms of literary expression are beyond
their powers. In the novel, however, the
case is somewhat different; if no woman
has the sweep, power, mind of Tolstoy
or Dostoevsky or Cervantes or Rabelais
there are still women like Austen and
Undset holding a rank quite unknown to
their sex in other arts.
Since the beginnings of the novel it
has been a favorite form with women.
Aphra Behn, one of the earliest of our
English novelists, is still a considerable
figure; and in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries it is possible that
there have been more women novelists
than men. While the quality of their
work has not (with a few exceptions) been
high, the quantity has been enormous.
The women novelists have largely catered
for the women-created and women-sus-
tained circulating libraries ; and it is in
the dependence of the circulating libraries
on women readers and writers that one
line of fruitful research lies.
There can be little doubt that the cir-
culating-library influence has been disas-
trous for literature ; the decay of values
and standards all too evident in the mass
production of our time and the mass
reading of our time can, I think, be
traced to the libraries as much as to the
cheap press or our methods of popular
“education.” To the policy of the
libraries is due the fact that fiction and
the more superficial varieties of biog-
raphy and travel writing are almost the
only kinds of books which are now com-
mercially profitable and so in the ordinary
way publishable. Poetry, philosophy and
serious history are drugs in the market;
I suppose a hundred thousand of Edgar
Wallace’s works are read for one of
W. H. Auden’s ; libraries ignore a Chris-
topher Dawson or a D. B. Wyndham
Lewis, though they have shelves of
Georgette Heyer.
The policy of the circulating libraries
is presumably shaped to the demands
Any Woman, any Circulating Library, any Day: “I want a book I can lose
myself in!”
of their patrons, and ever since Lucy said
in The Rivals, “I don’t believe there’s a
circulating library in Bath I haven’t been
at,” the patrons have been mostly
women. The circulating libraries were
strongly suspected during their early
years by most people with serious literary
taste ; and the suspicion has surely been
more than justified. Their general effect
has been deplorable. (There are honor-
able exceptions where a public has made
exceptions possible. The London Library,
for instance, is a magnificent institution ;
but how many libraries are there which
even begin to cultivate its ideal?)
Women possess a deep and abiding
interest in social manners, fashions and
customs; the majority of successful
women writers excel in depicting social
manners and fashions and customs. Few
(the only probable exceptions here which
occur to me are George Eliot and Sigrid
Undset) women novelists have any sense
of the profounder social issues ; among
contemporaries there is no woman to
share the task of Upton Sinclair, Dos
Passos, Wells, Belloc, Lawrence or even
Sinclair Lewis, shoddy as his opinions
are. With the exception of Lewis and
Wells, none of these men has been
a library success (D.H.L. may have had
a certain success of scandal); women
writers and, presumably, women readers
have neglected the most serious social
purposes of the novel. The appeal of the
form for women seems to lie in its loose-
ness of construction, the facilities it offers
for the development of sentiment and
sensibilities, its tendency to deal in pic-
tures rather than with intellectual con-
cepts, its gossipiness and its neglect (on
the whole) of logical structure and logi-
cal argument. In other words, its appeal
lies in exactly those qualities which are
the weakness of the novel or of most
novels, the weakness which was noticed
so precisely by Coleridge and which has
lately been commented on, with admir-
able effect, by Mrs. Q. D. Leavis: its
tendency to offer merely an escape from
life and not an avenue to the better
understanding of life.
We must accept the fact nowadays that
there are very few serious readers, either
men or women ; and the few are growing
fewer. The reason for this is complex,
but one indisputable factor is the influence
of the mass of women readers. The great
magazines cater principally for women ;
and the standards of the magazines are
the standards of the circulating libraries.
When one looks at the later Bennett
(Imperial Palace, for example) or Priest-
ley or Vicki Baum, all enormous suc-
cesses, and then sets their work beside
the popular novelist of an earlier age,
Defoe or Fielding or Sterne, one begins
to have some sense of what is happening
to us. It is becoming more and more
difficult for the serious writer to find a
paying public. Soon, if things continue
as they are, it will be impossible; all
literature will have been reduced to
superficial novels and cheap travel books
(like Morton’s quaint productions) and
silly biographies. There will be no
market for anything of more worth.
What is needed, and urgently needed if
any sort of decent standard is to be main-
tained, is an adequate research into the
nature and propensities of the library
publics. I suppose it is useless to expect
a thesis from any of our honors schools ;
possibly some earnest journal might
undertake it. As things are, the evidence
suggests that women are the dominating
influence in library demand and so in
library supply; the libraries are the
principal sources of publishers’ revenue,
and the publishers necessarily determine
which books shall be published and which
shall not. Further evidence suggests that
the majority of books published must be
more harmful than useful to the reader,
contributing nothing to his mental life
but specious emotional stimuli, false
sentiments and trite notions. We have
little concern for good art, but it is
socially necessary that we should have
some concern for bad art. Bad art in-
duces emotional and intellectual mal-
adjustments, and a bad book supply or a
bad film supply is as socially noxious as
a bad milk supply.
It may seem unfair and unreasonable
to place the major burden of responsi-
bility on women ; admittedly, it must now
be spread over the general reading
public. But the general reading public
has ■ taken its tone from the read-
ing habits of the mass of women, for
they have conditioned the principal
sources of supply. The advance in popu-
larity of the novel has been largely due
to women readers ; and, as its popularity
has advanced, its average quality has
declined, while it has destroyed the
popular taste and talent for other reading.
I have made little attempt to argue
the case logically. The matter here is
meant to be suggestive and provocative,
for it seems to me that we should argue
the issues out; but, to provide some
direction for logical thought and argu-
ment, I state these points:
1. The novel, of all art forms, is the
one most peculiarly adapted to the
female temperament.
2. The rising tide of novels and of cir-
culating libraries to supply them (it is
significant that people do not care to
buy novels as they bought poetry and
belles-lettres) is largely due to the taste
of women readers.
3. With the rising tide of novels has
gone a decline in the popular apprecia-
tion of other literary forms and a gen-
eral lowering of the average quality of
the novel itself.
4. With a consequent further deteriora-
tion of the public taste, implying neces-
sarily an increasing reluctance to listen
to the serious writer, and so an increasing
shrinkage in the amount of serious
writing.
5. That the influence of the popular
fiction magazines is conditioning the
methods of almost all writers who want
to make more than a bare sufficiency
from their trade, that the magazines
derive their tone from what they
know or believe to be the demand of
their readers, and that their readers are
mostly women. In evidence for the last
assertion, I cite the advertisements so
lavishly packed into the magazines ; the
fiction has now become merely an ad-
junct to and an excuse for the adver-
tisements, and the advertisements are
nearly all designed, unmistakably and
obviously, for women. Advertisers are
commonly shrewd fellows; they know
who reads the magazines. And the read-
ers of the magazines are helping to
destroy literature.

A dog had bit-
ten the boy on the
face, and the
mother, si t ting
beside him on the
ferry, did not
look very pleased with the result.
“I like dogs,” she said widely ; “I like
any sort of dogs, but I’d cheerfully have
that black, brute shot.”
To which, out of a mouth freshly
mangled and puffed where the bite had
come on that side of his face, the boy
said: “He might have been only play-
ing. I think he thought he was.”
“All very well,” said the mother.
I went on with my reading—as it hap-
pened, of Helen Waddell’s Beasts and
Saints —though I kept thinking what a
rare sort of compassion that was to come
from one with a face cut about so sav-
agely and so recently.
Then it seemed the conversation had
taken a turn: this is the peril of reading
in public places.
“He is a Christian dog,” the boy was
saying; “he belongs to the Brothers.”
“They ought to know better,” said the
mother, “than to encourage such a coarse
Christian.”
This did not seem right: I had heard
of a footballer being called that, but it
seemed an odd thing to say of a dog ;
very odd, coming from that speaker. Her
next remark was more in character:
“They’ll have to shoot the black brute.
Your father will see the police.”
The boy’s face was too cut and puffed
for it to express any feeling, one way
or other, on that, but he said:
“He did jump up as if he was playing,
the way he used to.”
The mother’s face gave her feelings,
decidedly. I turned to reading again.
Vaguely, keeping to that odd note of
compassion, the conversation kept on.
“If the blessed Ammon is one of the
Brothers, they would not have to shoot
it, because he could call on God to slay
it, if he wanted to, as He did the
dragon.”
“Dragons are different,” said the
mother.
“To the dragon,” the boy chanted
heedlessly, “the blessed Ammon turned
and said, ‘May Christ the Son of God
slay thee, even as he shall slay the great
whale.’ And at the old man’s word, that
most dire dragon vomited forth its spirit
and its venom together, and burst
asunder with a loud crack. And all the

Che Centenary of a great
Banking Institution
Although in 1834 the Colony of New South Wales
embraced half a continent, with a white population of
only 66,000, the founders of The Commercial Banking
Company of Sydney had confidence in the future and
a determination to implant the principles of sound
Banking practice in the young Colony, and now, having
achieved its Centenary, The Commercial Banking
Company of Sydney, Limited, stands as the active
realisation of its founders’ courage and aspirations.
In achieving its Centenary, the Bank has maintained
an unbroken record of service to the community and
the confidence of its depositors and shareholders alike.
Under the able guidance of those who have directed its
destinies during the past 100 years, The Commercial
Banking Company of Sydney, Limited, has afforded
liberal assistance to the growth of Australia’s Primary
and Secondary Industries, and in so doing has con-
tributed to the development of the early Colony from
a pioneer settlement to a now great Commonwealth
among Nations. '
In entering on its second century, The Commercial
Banking Company of Sydney, Limited, has added
another historic chapter to the annals of Australia, and
the Bank’s future progress will be maintained on the
sound traditions of its past record and an earnest
endeavor to be of still greater service to the coming
generation.

dwellers in that countryside came up
and stood dumb at so mighty a miracle:
and unable to bear the vehement stench,
they heaped on him vast mounds of
sand.”
“Dragons are very different,” said the
mother firmly.
“Well,” said the boy, “lions?” He
took up the thread, in the chanting
voice: “There was a certain old man, a
solitary, who lived near the river lordan:
and going into a cave because of the
heat, he found there a lion: and the lion
began to gnash his teeth and to roar.
To whom the old man said, ‘What is
annoying thee? There is room enough
here to hold both me and thee. And if
thou likest it not, arise and go hence.’
But the lion, not taking it well, left and
went outside.”
“There you are,” said the mother, “the
lion was annoyed, and so was that big
black dog.”
“I think he thought he was playing,”
said the boy; “and if St. Godric lives
there, he could touch him with his stick
and teach him better, like he did to the
hare.” He intoned: “He had planted
vegetables to feed poor men, and these
a little hare used stealthily to devour.
He put’ up with the damage for a long
time: but at last the track of its paws
betrayed the person of the delinquent:
and he came on the thief in his garden,
and as it turned in headlong flight he
bade it halt. The poor little creature
stopped, and waited in trembling and
alarm the arrival of its pursuer. The
Saint caught it, struck it with his rod,
and binding a bundle of vegetables on its
shoulders sent it off, with these words:
‘See to it that neither thyself nor any
of thy acquaintance come to this place
again : nor dare to encroach on what was
meant for the need of the poor.’ And
so it’ befel.”
“Hares are different from dragons,”
said the mother maternally ; “they don’t
bark.”
“I wonder what they call the noise
dragons make,” said the boy, wiping
away a speck of blood from where the
tooth had sunk in under his cheekbone.
He knew his mother had meant dogs.
She was just as likely to have said frogs.
“St. Benno,” he said, “once spoke to the
frogs.” He chanted again: “It was often
the habit of the man of God to go about
the fields in meditation and prayer: and
once as he passed by a certain marsh, a
talkative frog was croaking in its slimy
waters: and lest it should disturb his
contemplation, he bade it to be a Sera-
phian, inasmuch as all the frogs in
Seraphus are mute. But when he had
gone on a little way, he called to mind
the saying in Daniel: ‘O ye whales and
all that move in the waters, bless ye the
Lord. O all we beasts and cattle, bless ye
the lord.’ And fearing lest the singing
of the frogs might perchance be more
agreeable to God than his own praying,
he again issued his command to them,
that they should praise God in their
accustomed fashion: and soon the air
and the fields were vehement
with their conversation.”
“Frogs do talk a lot,” said
the mother agreeably.
“It mightn’t have been a
dog at all,” said the boy, cup-
ping the side of his face. “It
The Dragon.
might have been St. Ciaran’s Badger,
who stayed with him and the Fox
and the Wolf and the Deer, as if
they had been his monks.” He intoned:
“But one day the Fox, who was shrewder
and wilier than the other animals, stole
his abbot’s shoes and, abandoning his
vow, carried them off to his ancient
dwelling in the forest: intending to chew
them there. Knowing this, the good
Father sent another monk or disciple,
namely the Badger, into the forest after
the Fox, to bring back his brother to his
post. So the Badger, being well learned
in the woods, at once set out in obedi-
ence to his abbot’s bidding, and took his
way straight to the den of Brother Fox.
There finding him about to gnaw his
master’s slippers, he bit his ears and his
tail, and cropped his fur, and forced him
to come back with him to his monastery,
there to do penance for his theft. And
the Fox, necessity driving him, and the
Badger with him carrying the shoes none
the worse, came about Nones to St.
Ciaran in his cell. And the Saint said
to the Fox, ‘Wherefore, brother, didst
thou do this ill deed, which it becomes
not monks to do? Behold, our water is
sweet and free to us, and food is here
for us all alike to share. And if thou
hadst a longing, as is thy nature, to eat
flesh, Almighty God would have made it
for thee from the roots of these trees, if
we had asked Him.’ Then the Fox en-
treated his forgiveness.”
“Foxes are all right in their place,
which is mostly in books,” said the
mother primly.
“Another time,” the boy chanted at
once, “another fox
stole a book from
the brethren, and
carried it off to hide
it in one of his
earths, intending to
come hack shortly
and gnaw it there.
But on his return to
the monastery, he
was found stealing
and eating a honey-
comb. Whereupon
the brethren laid
hold on him and
brought him to St.
Moling, and accused
him of stealing the
book. And the holy
man bade the
brethren to let him
go free. And when
he was released the Saint said to him, ‘O
wise and crafty one, be off, and bring me
back that book unharmed, and quickly.’
At that, off went the fox, and hastened to
bring the book from his cave, and set it
down dry and unharmed before the holy
bishop. And then he lay upon the ground
before the man of God, as if seeking
forgiveness. And the Saint said, ‘Get up,
you wretch, and fear nought: but never
touch a book again. And the fox got up
rejoicing, and fulfilled in marvellous wise
the Saint’s behest: for not only did he
never touch books again, but if anyone
would show him a book in jest, he took
to flight.’
“Men are like foxes,” said the mother
thoughtfully.
“But if they did read books, they could
do like St. Colman,” said the boy, with
the flat of his hand pushing, as it were,
the swelling back into his face. “St.
Colman kept a Cock, a Mouse and a
Fly to help him.” He intoned: “The
way that he used the Cock was'that its
crowing wakened him at night to Lauds,
as a bell might. But the offices rendered
by the Mouse and the Fly were the
stranger and the more remarkable in that
these whom nature has designed to the
fret and annoyance of mankind, the
amazing kindness of God directed,
against’ the weight of nature, to tend-
ance upon His servants. For this was the
service of the Mouse to the man of
God, that it would not allow him to
sleep or lie at peace beyond the fixed
hour that he had laid down for himself
in his holy vows: but when his body
and his tired limbs, worn but with vigil
and prayer and his other austerities,
would have craved sleep and rest beyond
the stern limits of his vow, the Mouse,
sometimes by gnawing at his clothes,
sometimes by nibbling at his ear, would
drag him from all quiet. Yet scarcely
less remarkable was the office of the Fly.
For when the man of God had leisure
to read his holy books, the Fly would
trot up and down his codex: and should
someone call him, or he had to go
about other business, he would instruct
the Fly to sit down upon the line at which
he had halted, and keep his place until
he should return to continue his inter-
rupted reading: which the Fly infal-
libly would do. Marvellous are these
condescensions of the grace of God.”
The ferry stopped at a wharf, and I
looked up to see mother and boy making
for the gangplank. The boy was holding
a handkerchief to his mouth: his face
was puffed and cut about’: there had
been no miracle: only the coincidence,
commonplace enough, I suppose, that the
boy’s feeling for the dog—“that big
black brute” —had so blended in with
and expressed the quaint theme of com-
passion in Helen Waddell’s translations
from those old Latin sources of stories jf
the saints and their companionship with
beasts ; and which the venerable Robert
Gibbings enhanced with his noble wood-
cuts, for Constable to publish.
I don’t know about the dog. If I
owned him, or the boy, it would be a
different thing. I would prefer the boy.

“NO WIRELESS.”
In the desperate days of 1914 the French
were stirred by a story which, true or
not, has become part of their national
history. An officer lay wounded to
death, with all his soldiers shot to pieces
about him—not one poilu erect. To his
fading senses came the sound and sight
of enemies advancing to take the posi-
tion. With a supreme effort he struggled
up and gave the command “Forward, the
dead!” It brought his men from the
valley of the shadow, and together the
spectral heroes held the ground till com-
rades, rushing up, relieved them.
Peace has its triumphs of the human
spirit, too. Captain Foley, of the Koom-
partoo, one of the Sydney Ferry Co.’s
steamers, was taking her alongside Tar-
onga Park wharf when he was overcome
by a seizure. Consciousness left him, but
not before his sense of duty asserted
itself ; with a last convulsive movement
he rang for “full speed astern.” The
signal was obeyed in the engine-room,
and the ferry, which was crowded with
passengers, backed into safety. Had she
continued on with no one at the wheel
she would have cannoned into the wharf
or rushed on the rocks near by,
perhaps pitching women and children
into deep water. One of the engineer’s
men, hurriedly mounting the bridge,
found Captain Foley “slumped up on a
box, with his head in his hands”—life-
less and beyond any doctor’s aid. Dying,
he saved his ship—and died.
Australia owes much to men who fol-
low Captain Foley’s calling in all its
branches. Its rulers are very careless
about repaying the debt. On the even-
ing of the day that witnessed Foley’s
last act of devotion, the body of Seaman
Byrne was found on the basalt rocks
of Phillip Island. He was a member of
the crew of the Coramba, Captain
Dowling, 40 hours overdue from Warr-
nambool with 17 souls, and the discovery
made it plain that there was no hope
for the vessel or for any of Seaman
Byrne’s companions.
That night another body was found,
that of the second officer, Wishart,
and near it a bat'tered lifeboat, in
which Wishart and Byrne had evi-
dently rowed from the doomed steamer
until it capsized in the surf. When day
broke the back beach was strewn with
wreckage—companion-way steps, win-
dow-frames, water-casks, tanks, poles
“used for the centenary decorations at
Portland,” a baby’s woollen suit and
“Christmas toys which members of the
crew had been making for their children.”
The Coramba was a twin-screw
steamer of 531 tons gross register, en-
gaged in the trade between Melbourne
and Vic. Western District ports. Built
in Scotland for North Coast Steam
(N.S.W.), she was bought from that com-
pany after the wreck of the Casino in
July, 1932, when 10 men were drowned.
Seaman Foley was one of them ; his son
and Bellairs, a steward, were saved, only
to go to the bottom with the Coramba.
Like the Casino, the Coramba carried
no passengers and had no wireless.
Could life have been saved had she been
able to communicate with the shore? It
is very possible ; the saving of the Dutch
airliner when she had lost her way in
a tempest with four or five hours to day-
light and only two hours’ supply of
petrol in her tanks showed what wire-
less is capable of when there are active
and resourceful fellows to utilise it. And
Australian watermen are a hardy and
intrepid breed ; it was on the very coast
where the Coramba and the Casino were
wrecked that Ferrier the fisherman rowed
his boat through a storm to the rescue of
the crew of a steamer that was breaking
up fast. But wireless there was none.
No wireless on the Coramba or the
Casino. None on the Christina Fraser or
the Annie M. Miller ; none on the Dor-
rigo. Twenty Queensland seamen went
down with the Dorrigo in 1926, six N.S.W.
men with the Annie M. Miller in 1929,
18 more with the Christina Fraser in
1933—73 in five wrecks. Nor does this
exhaust the dreadful list. “In 10 years
nine Australian ships not equipped with
wireless have been lost on the Australian
coast,” says the general secretary of the
Marine and Power Engineers. Wireless
is not dear, but seamen’s lives seem to
be cheap.
Like so many other things in Aus-
tralia, navigation is everywhere “con-
trolled” in a demented fashion by two
authorities, Commonwealth and State;
and there are, of course, six States.
Under Commonwealth law vessels under
1600 tons gross register are allowed to
go to sea without wireless, and under
State law vessels of any tonnage need not
have it, so long as they do not go beyond
their particular State. The Coramba, the
Casino, the Christina Fraser, the Annie
M. Miller and the Dorrigo were all in
the intra-State trade.
The Marine Court that inquired into
the loss of the Christina Fraser added to
its finding a recommendation that all
seagoing vessels should be compelled to
carry wireless. A committee reporting sub-
sequently recommended the installation
of small, inexpensive sets capable of
being operated by the captain or one of
the mates.
The subject was discussed at the first
of this year’s litter of Premiers’ Con-
ferences. It was pointed out that the
High Court had ruled that the Common-
wealth Parliament has no legislative
power over vessels engaged in the domes-
tic trade of any one State, and the State
Governments were invited to give it this
power. They could do it without a
referendum ; simple Acts of Parliament
would suffice. But somebody must have
muttered something about “State rights”
—words which have blighted in the
bud so many necessary reforms; anyway,
the debate petered out; and, the loans
having been arranged for, the Premiers
gathered up their papers and went home.
In the Prime Minister’s phrase, “the dis-
cussion was inconclusive.”
The seamen have resorted to action
that may be “conclusive.” Learning that
the steamer Sphene was to take the
Coramba’s place, the Victorian branch
of the union refused to man her till she
was equipped with wireless. They de-
cided also that after 14 days they would
serve in no coastal steamer without it.
Seamen in all the States are taking the
same stand. Who can blame them?
OBSTACLES TO “WAR
RENUNCIATION.”
The prophecy of Malthus that the human
race would increase too quickly for its
food supplies has proved false. There is
a wheat glut in France which will cost
the Government £32,000,000 this year;
the money is to go in buying and de-
naturing surplus wheat, after which
extension of wheatgrowing is to be
prohibited. Simultaneously the French
Government will buy and get rid of
33,000,000 gallons of surplus wine and
“enforce reduction of the areas under
vines and abandonment of hybrid
varieties.”
Farmers in the U.S.A.’s Middle West
have been burning wheat for fuel, while
Washington has been paying other
farmers not to produce hops and maize.
The International Wheat Conference
“strongly favors a reduction in Aus-
tralia’s export quota for 1934-35 from
150 million bushels to 100 million
bushels.” Elsewhere coffee and other
foodstuffs are being destroyed.
Yet millions are feeding better than
they ever did in the past. The British
Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture
told the general assembly of the Institute
of Agriculture at Rome last month that
during the past four years of depression
Britain has consumed 40 per cent, more
butter, 31 per cent, more eggs, 35 per
cent, more poultry and 25 per cent, more
fruit than in the previous four years.
Other millions—Chinese, Indians, East-
ern Europeans—are suffering from mal-
nutrition for lack of the meat, wheat,
coffee and fruit which their neighbors
are sabotaging at great trouble and
expense.
Economic nationalism is usually
blamed, and no doubt it is responsible
to an extent. Since strong mercantile
marines are indispensable to the safety
of sea-bound countries the maritime
nations do all they can to prevent
foreigners from getting a grip on their
overseas shipping business. Hence the
exercise of cabotage, which allows
nations to monopolise sea-transport be-
tween given points on their coasts. It all
helps to prevent foodstuffs from being
moved cheaply from the regions where
there is a surplusage to those whose in-
habitants are hungry. And the principle
of cabotage is to be applied to air trans-
port, which will not tend to promote
peace.
To add to the muddle, transport is
often handicapped within the boundaries
of States. In N. S. Wales the Government
relies on a Transport Regulation Act to
diminish its annual loss on the railways
—an Act which aims at making it im-
possible for farmers to send their pro-
duce to market or anywhere else by
motor-lorry. Other States are following
the N. S. Wales example. An effect
is to prevent those with necessaries
to sell from getting in touch with those
who are desperately anxious to consume
them ; and this leads to ill-feeling, such
as was displayed by a Maoriland doctor
last week on being told that the Duke
was bringing a wreath “from Australia”
to lay on one of M.L.’s soldier
memorials. The doctor surmised that
Australians were sending the wreath,
and protested that it would be “infernal
cheek” in view of the Commonwealth’s
economic attitude towards the sister-
Dominion.
Australia bars M.L. produce (potatoes,
for example, which Maoriland growers
could scarcely give away when potatoes
were selling here for £lB a ton), and
M.L. bars Australian produce (such as
oranges, which were going dirt cheap
here at a time when they were almost
unprocurable in M.L.). And with it all
transport grows more and more efficient,
which is to say that the nations are all
getting nearer and nearer to one another
in a physical sense, however widely they
may be separated culturally and eco-
nomically.
What the remedy may be nobody pre-
tends to know (it would be the greatest
discovery of this or any other age), but
one thing is certain. If a food-shortage
vis-a-vis a food surplusage is capable of
causing ill-feeling between Australia and
M.L., any two countries are liable to be
embroiled. Envy on the part of the
underfed inspired all the great invasions
of the past, and human nature hasn’t
changed since the first desert raider de-
scended on fruitful Egypt. The only
material change is that it has become
much easier for invaders to reach their
objectives.
How ridiculous, in the circumstances,
for Mr. Scullin and Mr. Beasley to talk
as they did in the Representatives last
Wednesday of “standing for disarma-
ment” and “renouncing war”! Australia
can only do this when the nations that
have cause to envy it and are capable of
striking at it lay down their arms.
THE OLD BULLOCK-DRAY.
When we were very young in western
Queensland we always discussed for
weeks in advance the arrival of the sea-
sonal bullock-dray.
It was a long, unwieldy vehicle. Twenty-
six reds and roans from South Comongin
used to draw it, and they walked with
an air—there was a touch in them of
the old Cherry and Oxford blood which
the A.A. Co and others had imported in
the ’seventies. “Blood” in the next de-
cade had gone to a serious discount, but
not with bullockies, for these animals
were tall and fine-boned, with great
shoulders and feet firm on the ground.
Our dray was attached to them with
vicarious harness, and on it sat a moun-
tain of stores —flour in twenty-fives, tea
in chests, golden syrup in cases, kerosene
in tins. In front of it old Dodds walked,
with the whip which he never used over
his arm and a choice flow of language
ever on his tongue. His cabbage-tree
had a ’possum-skin band, and his shirt
was blue galatea, and his boots were hide
moggins with the fur inside, for his
ankles had been chafed badly in irons
when he was exported from a colder
clime for seven years for stealing nine
apples. I have since sometimes doubted
those apples, but I never doubted his
manhood.
When our dray was unloaded, the next
move always was to load it again. Wool-
bales were not so compact then as they
are now, but they sat pretty square and
the muscles which twitched them down
were all steel wire. So that the top of the
load was flat enough to hold four or five
small boys clinging to ropes. Because
the sun was blinding they were decked
in mushroom-hats, which they discarded
with jeers so soon as they were out of
sight of the station; and because the
bush was grey and greedy they were
dressed in turkey-red so as to make them
an easy mark for searchers.
Thus off to Yeulba, 12 days away, they
went, to camp by the cod holes and lie
awake at night in a crystal air made
sweet with wood-smoke while the men
yarned, just out of the firelight, as they
always did, and Orion and the Cross
made a slow procession across the sky,
and the talk flickered back and forth
from Gladstone to Governor Bourke,
from “Jimmy Tyso” to the Maori War.
At Yeulba there was somebody who
washed us lavishly—a shocking waste
(for where we came from water was
treated with respect), and gave us pink
mice made out of sugar. Men on the
Yeulba platform, grizzled and heat-dried,
drew maps on the platform as they
talked of droving routes, of the Hornet
Bank murders and the Canoona gold
rush as if they had happened only
yesterday.
* * * *
It reminds me somehow of the old
bullock-dray, but it carries no wool, and
the four bullocks on the team are sky-
bred. They have never heard of Bates
any more than the clean, uniformed
young men who drive them have known
ankle chains. No language avails with
them because they drown every other
voice with their bellowing. Groomed with
a care which no “bawly” ever knew,
they move off at a word, “contact.”
In a minute iron roofs are shimmering
below us, and we see for miles the ser-
pentine of the Brisbane River making its
way between endless houses. On a wing,
the speed indicator says “120” as we ease
our cushioned seat backwards to get the
right angle. Nobody in the flower-
decked cabin, with its hot and cold air
and its racks, wears turkey-red. If you
are lost, you are lost indeed.
Here is the railway wending westward
' to where shining motors wake on roomy
aerodromes. Here are tracts where,
in a year or so, the prickly-pear has given
up a kingdom ; here the tangled ranges
beyond Milo, and the wandering Barcoo.
Presently come the red Selwyns, and
the golden carpet of the Barkly fades
into grey bush near the northern coast-
line. Before long the Ganges lies
below us, and Charles’s Wain, an awk-
ward but intrusive constellation, rides
unchallenged down the sky. We shall see
teeming cities and long desert coast-
lines ; we shall glimpse to the north hills
where an Australian brought oil gush-
ing from the depths. Bagdad and its
twin rivers will slip by, and the immen-
sity of ruined Babylon, and Alexandria,
gateway to Gallipoli ; and, to our right,
the Taurus will climb into the clouds in
gleaming needles, gliding astern so
swiftly that the Alps seem to be their
neighbors.
And, in a little while, crossing, very
high up, a tiny stretch of water that
might be the Thompson in high flood,
we sweep down into this newer Yeulba,
the southern purlieus of London, and
hear the boom of Big Ben echoing
through the fog above the roar of traffic.
Twelve days it takes from Brisbane to
London, the period of our bullock-dray
Odysseys long ago. No men sit at the
journey’s end on sun-scorched platforms
talking of Hornet Bank. But as far away
as the Dawson was from our boyhood
destination long guns poke their noses
towards Orion, and men speak of fright-
fulness far worse than the murder of an
isolated family, and cities brood, seem-
ing not to know when they will be
wrapped in a miasma of gas bombs. The
sunshine left behind with the Southern
Cross seems cleaner than the lowering
winter skies of the anxious Old World.
Not an Australian who traverses the new
track but will long to come back to a
land where there are no battlefields and
where the only graves outside the cities
are the widely-scattered tombs of
pioneers.
BULLOO.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
It Might Have Been Worse.
In the early ’nineties low-lying Mel-
bourne was submerged by a flood which
laid waste property worth hundreds of
thousands of pounds. Nevertheless, there
was an outcry when it was suggested
that the equivalent, wisely expended,
would prevent a repetition of the
disaster, perhaps on a greater scale.
The welkin vibrated with protests that
flood-prevention was not “reproduc-
tive,” and that the country needed every
penny it could borrow for “reproductive”
works, like railways to serve wheat-
farmers on the 10-inch fringe. It was
better to chance future floods, the cave-
men of the era pleaded, than to divert
capital from fruitful channels.
The “extravagant” party won the day.
The money was spent; the Yarra was
widened for four or five miles —at
Prince’s Bridge its width was doubled—
sharp curves were straightened. It is
difficult for those who did not know the
old river to believe the maps which show
where it once ran. As a result of the
alterations, Melbourne enjoyed 33 years
without a flood worth mentioning ; and
now the worst deluge on record has
caused damage which (though consider-
able where it could not be prevented)
is trifling compared with what the city
must have suffered had the improvements
of the ’nineties not been carried out.
The flow of water was immeasurably
greater than that of 1891, yet it invaded
only a fraction of the metropolis. Had
the Yarra been left as it was 40 years
ago every bridge would have been swept
away, the electric supply would have
been cut off, the water supply wrecked.
Worse than all, the sewerage system
would have been thrown into scrap, with
epidemics of filth diseases as the inevit-
able sequel.
Great was the destruction in Gipps-
land and in places like Koo-wee-
rup and Chelsea, and much will have to
be done —and is being done —to repair
the ravages and relieve the necessities of
the sufferers. (It is a duty which should
not rest on the Victorians alone; in
time of trouble in other States they have
always been to the fore with generous
assistance.) But greater efforts and
expenditure would be necessary in Mel-
bourne itself if the city had not, in the
time of the last depression, been blessed
with men who had energy and vision.
The wise men of the ’nineties saw what
was necessary for the protection of life
ajid property, and they did it, heedless
of lesser men. j

Goldmining and EmploymenL^L
JThe Melbourne conference at which
State Ministers of Mines and their ad-
visers met Mr. Stewart, now called Com-
monwealth Under-Secretary for Employ-
ment, brought forth no statesmanlike
ideas, but everybody agreed that assist-
ance to goldmining would promote em-
ployment.
It was mentioned that in the first six
months of 1934 every State but West-
ralia had produced more gold than it did
in 1930; compared with the first six
months of 1932 Queensland’s output, in
fine ounces, had advanced from 5404 to
54,500, Victoria’s from 20,043 to
34,771, South Australia’s from 1179 to
4316, N. S. Wales’s from 14,441 to
17,240 and Westralia’s from 285,276 to
316,332. Westralia’s production was just
on three-fourths of the total, 427,989
fine ounces. And employment of gold-
miners has shot up from 5686 in 1928
to 27,686 in 1933.
The conference approved of a scheme
by virtue of which prospectors will re-
ceive subsidies and loans, batteries and
treatment works will be erected where
needed and necessitous companies en-
gaged in legitimate development will be
financed. The Commonwealth is back-
ing it to the extent of £403,000, and Mr.
Lyons hopes that “5500 additional men
will be absorbed.” It is far removed
from the bold conception of' Dr. Rivett,
of the C. S. and I. R. ; even so, Australia
is likely to get a lot more for the money
than for an equal expenditure on the dig-
ging of sewers.
f Obit.: “Civic Reform.” v/
**Fqr years Sydney has been notorious
for the ineptitude of its City
Council, and at intervals “inepti-
tude” has been too mild a word.
There are periodical attempts to im-
prove masters —the fight against the
lodger vote was one —and once the
Fathers were sent about their business,
the city being placed under Commission
rule. Unfortunately the Commission was
ill-chosen; for one thing, there were too
many elderly civil servants on it. Even
so, it cleaned up some of the mess the
Fathers had left, and retired without
having once quarrelled in public like
fruit-hawkers or given rise to the suspi-
cion in the most hostile quarter that
any member of it had been squared.
The Fathers returned. They were
somewhat subdued at first, but before
long they were brawling as of old. They
were divided into two groups of poli-
ticians styled Civic Reform and Labor.
The Civic Reformers had a small
majority. For one reason or another
the majority left them. With the aid of
the exuberant Labor faction, one of the
secessionists became Lord Mayor.
Matters were so plainly drifting to
chaos that the Government took a hand.
It altered the franchise and the voting
system (introducting preferentialism), and
increased the number of aldermen from
15 to 20. These changes prevented the
alleged Labor party (largely publicans
and agents) from regaining control by
means of the lodger vote. They may also
have induced one or two new men to
come out on the other side. In other
respects the election was much as usual.
Three-fifths of the electors did not vote ;
those who did put in 10 Civic Reformers,
eight Laborites and the two Independents
• —Lord Mayor Parker and Alderman Mc-
Elhone. “Deadlock again!” wails
the Old Lady of Hunter-street, and the
leader of the “Labor” faction, a very
minor member of Mr. Lang’s Caucus,
gleefully promises the Civic Reformers “a
hectic time during the next three years.”
At the moment the Civic Reform
League is giving a close imitation of the
expiring frog of Mrs. Leo Hunter’s
poem. The “apathy” for which it chides
the electors is largely attributable to its
own pledge-and-caucus methods, which
have been carried to such a pitch that
its candidates had to bind themselves
to vote only for a Civic Reform Mayor
—in effect, against Alderman Parker,
who now has the laugh on them and their
league. In many other municipalities,
suburban and country,
groups beat “Labor” out of the field
without copying the league or its
methods. In others the introduction of
party and pledge-and-caucus has been
steadfastly resisted by men on both sides.
While the city has been given over to
wrangling and futility, such districts —
notably Strathfield and Woollahra —have
been conspicuously well served.

A Tale of Three Generals.
of “Second Divvy”;
“General Brudenell White,” said Sir Alex-
ander Godley, of the Second Anzac Corps
. (1916-17), in a speech at Adelaide Town Hall
Vqn Wednesday, “was by far the ablest soldier
Australia has produced.” The English soldier
went on to remark that General Monash was
“also conspicuous for brains and ability.”
Every intelligent man who served in the
A.I.F. knows that Godley’s distinction was just.
But public opinion is largely represented in
Australia by civilians who take their views on
any question calling for hard thinking from
the tabloid newspapers, and these journals
have ignored White.
General Monash did wonderful work for
Australia. As an Australian who served under
him I regret that he saw fit to draw invidious
comparisons between British and Australian
troops on the Peninsula and in Flanders and
France. Whether or not the Australians were
superior has nothing to do with the case. If
they were it was not an Australian’s business to
say so for publication. Since General Monash
chose to do so, let another Australian express
the opinion that there were no better or braver
soldiers in any war theatre than the pick of
the 29th Division.
General Godley’s Adelaide speech was sig-
nificant. He would almost certainly have left
Monash alone in his glory but for the refer-
ence mentioned above.

The Mayo Method.
People who flock to the Mayo clinic at
Rochester, Minnesota, to be operated on
by one of the famous brothers are
charged a fee proportionate to their in-
come. Whether the operation be major
or minor, whether they be millionaire
or pe£nut-vendor, they are required to
pay one month’s earnings to the church
institution in control.
An application of this principle would
/relieve Australia’s hospitals of much
of the financial troubles they are en-
countering to-day. Dr. Gerald Weigall,
Vic. B.M.A. president, stated the other
day that the hospitals were erected for
the sick poor, and the sick poor were
crowded out by people who could afford
to pay for their medical advice. Much
the same thing is said by N.S.W. Health
Minister Weaver in the course of his
periodical attacks on hospital boards and
staffs. It is perfectly true, but there are
other factors to be considered.
Most of the patients in public hos-
pitals are certainly not down-and-outs,
persons on the bread line; they are
workers by hand or brain. They doubt-
less receive wages sufficient for people
who retain their health but inadequate
to pay the fees which a medical man
justly expects if he himself is to receive
a return commensurate with his ability.
The vast majority of doctors are paid
for only half the work they do. Many
are undoubtedly slipped up by ingrates
who could pay if they chose to deny
themselves some of their pleasures. But
there are other patients who, by no
stretch of imagination, could scrape to-
gether £5 to give a doctor who had
really earned £5O.
What is needed throughout Australia
is a system of secondary hospitals con-
ducted financially on the Mayo plan or
something like it, and where the re-
ceipts will be pooled to maintain the
hospitals and to pay the medical men in
attendance. There is no just reason why
a doctor should be expected to do medi-
cal or surgical work in a hospital for
nothing while the wardsmen and the
matron and the nurses and the secretary
are paid.

The Vanishing Irish Immigrant.
N. S. Wales census returns show a re-
markable decline in the number and pro-
portion of Irish-born inhabitants. In
12-odd years to June 30, 1933, while
there were increases of 18,304 (to
192,578) in the English-born and of
13,166 in the Scolli:h-born, the Irish-
born decreased by 79 SO.
Sixty-odd years ago, according to the
N. S. Wales “Statistical Register,” there
were more than three times as many
Irish in N. S. Wales as Scots ; now,
according to “Census Bulletin No.
9,” there are nearly twice as many Scots
as Irish:
Irish-born. Scottish-born.
1871 62,943 20,041
1881 69,192 25,079
1891 75,051 36,821
1901 59,945 30,717
1921 37,161 42,345
1933 29,181 55,511
There has been assisted immigration
from the U.K., off and on, for many
years and none to speak of from Ireland
in the last half-century. And no doubt
the Home Rule movement, from Par-
nell’s day to De Valera’s, has tended to
increase the attractions of the U.S.A. to
the Irish emigrant and lessen those of
Australia. Anyway, the influx of Irish
into N. S. Wales has been small com-
pared with the exodus to other parts and
the loss by death, and, unfortunately,
there is no reason to suppose that the
situation is any different in other States.
Thirty or forty years ago Irishmen
were to be found in every mining camp ;
in not a few cases they were the first
men there. They are remembered with
affection by men not of their race or
faith, and Australians would welcome
more of that bold and big-hearted breed.

The Oppressed Odds-layer.
With the fixing of a general-election
date expected at any moment, the hearts
of N.S.W. State politicians are almost
breaking for the pore bookmaker. A
Cabinet committee with Mr. Dunning-
ham on it (Mr. Dunningham was a book-
maker himself) has been inquiring into
his woes, and reduction of the turnover
tax of 1 p.c. is confidently expected;
indeed, legislation to provide for this
concession and others may be introduced
“before Christmas.” So much was con-
veyed to a meeting of Tommies at Tatt.’s
Club, Sydney, by three Government
members who went along to attend it.
But these Macquarie-street outbursts
of sympathy with bookmakers leave the
public cold. It may be true that the
racecourse operator is badly treated com-
pared with the illicit variety, but this
doesn’t entitle him to special considera-
tion. Nobody suggests that honest men
in other walks of life should be relieved
of taxes because there are rogues and
cheats.
Shop and street bookmakers are
lawbreakers as far as N. S. Wales is con-
cerned. Let the law be enforced against
them, and let them be deprived of Gov-
ernment telegraph facilities and of the
Government telephone and wireless
licenses without which most of them
could not carry on. The racecourse bookie,
for his part, is exempted from the law —
licensed to follow a trade which calls
for very little exertion, and is economi-
cally useless and worse. It is only fair
that he should pay handsomely for the
privilege. In not a few cases he has
cleared more at a round of spring meet-
ings than a farmer makes in a lifetime;
but if he finds the pursuit unprofitable
he is at liberty to withdraw from it at
any time.

Bridging the Continent.
Veteran journalist J. Smethurst, from
Broken Hill:
Crawford Vaughan’s letter (B. 21/11/ ’34)
is a useful contribution to this subject. The
proposal to run a costly line from Red Hill
to Port Augusta to achieve a few only of
the benefits obtainable by simply continuing the
Broken Hill line to its intended terminus —the
Port Augusta railhead —is past all understand-
ing by those not in the secret, whatever the
secret may be. But if carried out it will de-
stroy one of the principal portions of the S.A.
railway system, as it will intercept or take away
a large proportion of the traffic on the Penin-
sula line without doing any visible compensatory
good anywhere to S.A. producers.
There is no such thing as an East-West trans-
continental railway. The coastal line round
the seaboard of the southern States is circum-
contincntal; and the turns and twists involved
in its contortions across and around S.A., which
are (naturally enough) giving so much pain to
the Commonwealth railway heads, ought to be
eliminated in the interests of commonsense.
The easiest and cheapest and most effectual
means of cutting out the tortuous maze of left
angles and right angles—all wrong angles—is
to complete the straight, one-gauge transcon-
tinental line, which can be done for about the
cost of the proposed destructive hemaphrodite
or hybrid three-rail abortion from Red Hill to
Port Augusta.
I have used a lot of ink during the past 25
years or so —and especially since the Broken
Hiil line was started —in urging that a real
transcontinental railway be made in Australia;
but I often doubt the sincerity of those people
who say they are in favor of cutting out the
breaks of gauge between the capital cities. The
breaks can be cut out between three—Brisbane,
Sydney and Perth —by converting the Kal-
goorlie-Perth section (as long ago agreed
upon) and making the short-line connection
from Broken Hill to Port Augusta; a link
fully calculated upon when 801 b. and 1001 b.
rails were laid by the N. S. Wales Government
on the Broken Hill line to carry the fast trans-
continental traffic. With this simple bit of
railway work completed there would be a one-
gauge railway from Brisbane to Perth. From
east to west it would be really transcontinental,
and some 400 miles would be saved in railage
and about ten hours in time, besides all the
saving in avoiding the kinks and jolts in the
steeplechase line from Adelaide to Port
Augusta.
Sums varying from £30,000,000 to
£60,000,000 are mentioned periodically in airy
tones by eminent politicians as money that
would be well spent in unifying the gauges; yet
there is a dead silence whenever the means of
doing about half the job for about four or
five per cent, of the amount is shown to them.
N. S. Wales has a standing offer to do its bit
to the S.A. border. The S.A. authorities are
dead against the scheme to side-track their
existing system by the official Commonwealth
proposal.

Divorce and Publicity.
The N.S.W. divorce law may be the
same for the rich as for the poor; the
publicity law is not. Let the respondent
be a woman and good to look at or
rich and she will have notoriety wherever
she goes. There will be no escape for
her from batteries of cameras, glaring
posters and furlongs of print recording
every detail of her private life and every
fragment of evidence against her, true or
false.
Divorce proceedings were begun
against a young wife and mother, mis-
conduct being alleged. On the day
before the case was to have come
on a newspaper announced that it
would be the biggest sensation in
the Divorce Court since the Field
trial. It enumerated a terrifying list
of cross-examiners. There was no hear-
ing. The woman anticipated it by dying.
“Veronal poisoning,” the coroner said;
“Tragedy of Society Woman Who
Dreaded Notoriety” was one paper’s
headline.
Preliminary proceedings brought to
light a letter in which the unhappy
woman wrote;
I have been very sick.... The case will
drag us all through the mud.... 1 just
do not know what to do 1 shall never
live to be dragged through a court with
everyone talking.
A doctor gave evidence that before
veronal finished her pitiful story he had
found her suffering from a slashed wrist
and in a state of collapse. After her
death —she had lodged a defence —all the
accusations against her, complete with
the names of the co-respondents, were re-
tailed at length in the press when there
was no way by which they could be
answered on oath.
In England, it is contempt of Court to
publish any details of a divorce suit or
picture of the parties before its com-
pletion, and even then judicial control
over the matter published is strict. Vic-
toria has a similar provision. Other
States might copy.

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Comic Strip”: Vic-
torian nudists have ap-
proached the municipality
of Phillip Island for per-
mission to use a section
of the beach. The council
decided to take no action,
but Premier Argyle sternly
denounced the project.
But there is no earthly
reason why nudists should
not carry out their prac-
tices, provided they are
well out of sight of people
who may object. Nudist
camps are common to-day
in Europe and America.
London newspapers con-
tain advertisements setting
forth the attractions of
rival clubs, and a con-
vention recently held in
London was seriously reported by the
press. The law in England regarding
nudity is clear: as long as they are out
of sight of any building or highway or
place of public gathering people may
give as many imitations of the Garden
of Eden as they like. The Australian
administration of the law is ridiculous.
Last summer two nudist parties were
fined in Melbourne for practising their
cult in the bay at 2 a.m.

“Bob the Nailer”: India saw an almost
unprecedented happening recently when
the Union Jack that flies night and day
above the ruined Residency at Lucknow,
preserved in memory of the historic siege,
was lowered to half-mast. This was done
during the funeral of F. G. Lincoln, last
survivor of the siege. Lincoln was born
in Lucknow, and was two years old when
the mutiny broke out. He lived to be-
come one of the city’s leading lawyers.
It is curious, by the way, that, with all
the modem demands for equality with
the sahib and the outcry by the Indian
against racial distinctions, there has never
been a recorded protest against the main-
tenance in the heart of one of the most
disaffected cities of India of the shot-
shattered Residency.

“Pincher”: It is hard to hear of in-
genuity going unrewarded, and one can-
not but sympathise with the London
thief who broke into a ready-made cloth-
ing shop and had just rigged himself out
in new gear when the police arrived on
the scene. Hopping into the show-
window, the resourceful one posed as a
tailor’s dummy, even to the orthodox
glassy stare and idiotic, grin. The police
found his discarded clothes, but they
searched in vain for the man, and were
just leaving the shop when a sneeze from
the show-window spilt the beans.

“Scribe”: The drowning of a youth
on the evening of Henley (Vic.) regatta
causes people who regularly attend this
function to marvel that such fatalities
are not more numerous. Henley is
something that attracts the general sight-
seers —not merely the rowing enthusiasts
—and, as a result, boats are hired in
dozens by boys and girls who never see
a boat except in pictures. Fully nine-
tenths of those on the river on Henley
day and night hardly know how to handle
an oar. They mostly embark by jump-
ing on the sheathing instead of stepping
on the keel ; changing seats is common,
while rocking the craft is deemed a prime
joke by many. A boat in unskilled hands
is as dangerous to those on board as
a motor-car would be with a novice at
the wheel.

“Mug Gunner”: Were the Turks
aware that the Allies were about to with-
draw from Gallopoli (B. 28/11 /’34)?
Well, the Turk is an old and wily cam-
paigner, and at that period he was Ger-
man-officered. For a fortnight preceding
the exodus the beaches from Anzac to
Helles were illuminated by bonfires burn-
ing abandoned war material. Austrian
submarines, always nosing off Anzac and
“Down a little, George!”
Helles, must have had an armchair view
of the proceedings. But you may be
sure that Abdul knew just what the
watchful Mediterranean squadron would
have done to him had he attacked the
ever-dwindling defence line on the
heights. Although' the great majority of
those who took part in the evacuation
were convinced that they “put one
over” the enemy, it was a cheerful illu-
sion. As my mate told one of the ad-
vance guard, “ ’Strewth, you needn’t have
muffled your feet with blankets; you
could have wore cowbells an’ carried
hurricane-lamps.”

“Old Q.”: Mention of the old Bris-
bane Gymnasium and that extraordinary
athlete “Doctor” Jack Hamilton (B.
28 /11 / ’34) reminds me that I saw the
Palmer veteran put up an even more
extraordinary performance than the box-
ing feat mentioned by “Turlutu.” A
noted master-at-arms—Dinnie or an
offsider —was visiting Brisbane with a
show which included swordplay of all
kinds. Hamilton took him on with the
foils blindfold and beat him pointless.
Hamilton for years held the world’s
record for revolver shooting, some of
his exhibitions with that unchancy
weapon suggesting that he could have
kept his end up against “Wild Bill”
Hickock, Billy the Kid and other Mur-
kan celebrities.

“Traverse”: Diggers will find no diffi-
culty in believing Norman Campbell’s
extraordinary story about Monash (B.
5/12/’34). I was a gunner. Early in
1918 our brigade batteries were some-
where east of Zillebekke, and I was with
the D.A.C. well west of Dickebusch. In
this remote and bloodless spot I took
some snaps of my horse. The O.C. seized
and destroyed them, reading me such a
lesson later on the criminal folly of acts
liable to supply the enemy with informa-
tion of a military nature that 1 felt lucky
to escape a court-martial. A few weeks
later 1 had a meal in an infantry mess
which was a few hundred yards from No
Man’s Land. The C.O. (his name is a
household word for efficiency) passed
round half a dozen photographs taken
by himself in his own front line! All
my experience of warfare was the same:
rules and regulations were for back-area
artists ; the genuine fighting-men scorned
them.

“Brick Court”: In England the other
day a woman was convicted of the
murder of her 30-year-old son, a cripple
and an imbecile. The evidence showed
that she had looked after him devotedly
from babyhood. Being ordered into
hospital herself for a serious operation
she could not endure the idea of leaving
her helpless charge at the mercy of the
world, so she gave him 100 aspirins and
put a gas tube in his mouth. The jury
had no option but to convict, though they
added the strongest possible recommen-
dation to mercy; the Judge had no
alternative but to put on the black cap,
though he expressed the opinion that
the day was not far distant when the
law would be altered to take such pitiful
cases as these out of the category of
murder. Nobody supposed that the
mother would be hanged (she was re-
prieved in a day or two) or even sen-
tenced to more than a nominal term of
imprisonment; the unwritten law, of
which' Judges can take no cognisance, is
often stronger than the criminal code.
But isn’t it time the law was altered to
deal with cases of this kind, which crop
up periodically? The difficulties may be
serious, but they are not insuperable.

“D.8.K.”: “Jay-walker” (B. 5/12/’34)
objects to the “invisible ray” anti-bur-
glary device on the ground of possible
accident in the shape of a person falling
or being pushed through a shop-window.
Admittedly such a thing might happen,
but the danger can be avoided by a little
forethought in application of the new
method. The swift dropping of a shutter
to cover the entire inside of the jeweller’s
window display is not the only way.
Trays containing valuables can be made
to disappear below the window level, or
to be whisked away into recesses over
which small steel shutters would drop.
Alternatively, whole window displays
can be so manipulated as to recede to
a position eight or ten feet inside the
premises, a happening which, encoun-
tered unexpectedly, would be sufficient to
deter any smash-and-grab artist.

“G.M.”: The man who does his duty
“come what may” has for centuries been
held up to the youth of the world as a
noble example. But a Toowoomba (Q.)
fireman who asked the Duke of Glou-
cester to stop smoking in the supper-room
at a civic ball because, as he explained,
“the risk of fire” was “very great” was,
according to his own account, “dragged
out and abused by the Mayor,” and has
been execrated by ultra-loyalists. He was
a Digger, it seems, and was obeying
orders —somebody higher up had in-
structed him to prevent smoking in a
building which, rightly or wrongly, was
deemed inflammable. If he hadn’t carried
out his instructions he could rightly have
been sacked ; if fire had broken out and
the Duke’s life had been lost all the fire-
men in the building would have
been held responsible if they escaped
death. The fact that six were present
shows that the people in control feared
fire outbreak, and if that fear were
sound other means —capable of giving
offence to nobody—should have been
found to ensure safety. The methods
of those in control resemble those of
the nigger dance secretary who asked for
special police to guard the entrance door
“They ain’t no tickets; this is a very
select affair,” he explained. “But how
will my men know who are entitled to
go in?” demanded the sergeant. “They’s
jest 200 invitations out,” explained the
nig. “Count off two hundred ; den shut
de doors an’ keep de rabble out.”

“J.H.F”: The “Agony Column” of the
daily newspaper usually repays reading.
Recently the following message appeared
in a Sydney paper:—
Give world to see you. Remember
Pagan Love Song.
A cryptic line, but one full of poignant
appeal—it might be the last desperate
throw of a broken-hearted lover. But
apparently the Pagan Love Song had
been sung in more than one pair of shell-
like ears, for four days later three replies
were printed. The first was non-commit-
tal and anonymous:
Pagan Love Song.—Wish see you. Write
Box , G.P.O.
“Joan,” also, was cautious:
If “Pagan Love Song” is J. McD., write
to home address. Joan.
Only “C.” was definite:
I do remember Pagan Love Song. Write
to old address. C.
The broken heart should be pretty well
mended by now. But what about the
others who missed the ad.?

“Gpa’s Understudy”: “G.M.” (B.
28/11 /’34) is in error when he says that
Kreitmeyer was “originally a partner”
with Dr. L. L. Smith in Cremorne
Gardens, Melbourne. This ambitious
amusement park was officially opened in
1853 by James Ellis. P. Scott took it
over two years later. Cremorne reached
its high-water mark when George Coppin
and G. V. Brooke assumed control in
1857. They spent £lOO,OOO in providing
amusement for their patrons, but their
were too ambitious, and in 1863
jfie whole concern was sold by auction.
To-day all that is left of Cremorne is a
part of the wall which enclosed the
gasometer at which the balloons were
inflated, and part of the wall of the
menagerie in which the first lions bred
in Victoria were born.

“Schnorrer”: More violence than
usual is done to family history by the
love romance in “The House of Roths-
child.” Nathan, who, incidentally, was
the third, not the eldest, son of the
Frankfurt founder, did not marry until
1806. He had no daughters until years
after Waterloo, which provides the climax
in the talkie. It was not until 1839, three
years after his death, that Hannah Meyer,
his sixth child and second daughter, mar-
ried the Hon. Henry Fitzroy (the Cap-
tain Fitzroy of the film story). Nathan
Rothschild was a very rigid Jew with
strong ideas on the subject of such
marriages.

“General Prac.”: I don’t know much
about this body-odor business as dis-
tinguishing one race from another, but
I do know that various diseases will
hit one nation between wind and water
while its neighbor remains unscathed.
And there seem to be national complexes
about illness. Here is an instance. Ustag
the Montenegrin came into my ward
suffering from a very mild pneumonia.
The students said,“Not much wrong with
him ; he’ll be out of hospital in a week.”
But Yoo-steetch unaccountably waned.
“No goot, doctor,” he said. “All-ways,
when the chest she get seek, my people
die” —and die he did. Why do Jews suffer
so from diabetes, and knuckle under to
serious operations on the lower
&£>wel? Why have chicken-pox and
measles slain thousands amongst Pacific. ,
islanders? Why did syphilis, imported
by the sailors of Columbus, ramp across
Europe when the Americas for aeons
had regarded it as nothing much worse
than a common cold? Finally, why (I
ask as an old ship’s surgeon) are the
Filipino and the Malay almost invariably
bad patients, and the Chinese very good
ones?,
A SUPERIOR ATTRACTION.
“All the English women cricketers touring Aus-
tralia are single, and declare themselves far more
interested in their game than in menfolk.”— “Age.”
They’re set on conquest, but it isn’t misters
They aim at captivating with their smiles;
It’s just to wallop their Australian sisters
With batting artistry and bowling wiles,
With cunning cuts and devastating twisters,
The maids have travelled all these thousand
miles.
To men, mere men, their thoughts will never
stray—
Not till the tour is over, anyway.
What amorous flappers designate as “pash” is
A tiling that’s absolutely off their beat.
The ball that swerves, the blade that flicks and
flashes,
They find a more exhilarating treat.
They’ve come to get their fingers on the Ashes,
To use that hackneyed metaphor—a feat
They patriotically set above
The call of courtship and the lure of love.
They value centuries above caresses;
No tribute to their looks, however pat,
Half the attraction for these girls possesses,
Or any such exultant thrill as that
When through the straining field the ball
progresses,
Cracked to the fence by some proficient bat.
Sweeter than whispered love-vows in their ears
The sweating Hill’s reverberating cheers.
They learned their craft from admirable tutors,
And learned it to some purpose, you can bet;
Their deadly yorkers and their whirling shooters
Are not the stuff to readily forget.
And (make a note of this) they want no suitors
To cramp their style before they’re fairly set.
They’ve come, remember, to these spacious parts
To shatter wickets, not to capture hearts.
They’re dabs at quick returns and grand
at catches;
They’ve studied hooks and fairly mas-
tered drives;
They’ll give our best, I fancy, quick dispatches
From pitch to pavvy when the time arrives;
They’re on for any contests except matches
Which turn engaging spinsters into wives.
The grand old game is more intriguing, far,
To these, its votaries, than menfolk are.

“Mikko”: Goulburn saw its first auto-
gyro last week, and an enthralled crowd
gazed heavenward at each street corner.
One group was joined by an elderly
farmer, who descended from an ancient
Ford to better examine the novelty. “By

machine spun past above him, “I never
thought I’d live t’see a reaper an’ binder

“Ctesar”: Travelling along Ross Smith-

noticed that the cross-street at the end
bore a brand-new nameboard—“Melrose-

approvingly to a local resident, “naming
a street after that young fellow from
Adelaide.” “No fear,” he replied ; “they
called that one before him. The council’s
just put new nameboards on all the
thoroughfares ; that one’s been Melrose-
street' as long as I can remember. Still,
it does seem appropriate.”

“Oxmead”: At first glance one
wouldn’t say that Macaulay and Jimmy
Thomas had anything in common, but
as Ministers of the Crown, with an inter-
nal of about 80 years between, they
“Gam, be your age!”
struck precisely the same sort of trouble.
And how differently they met it!
Macaulay, spending a week-end as
guest of Queen Victoria, dated a
letter from “Windsor Castle.” It
is difficult to see what else he could
have written, but the epistle somehow
got into print and a devil of a hubbub
followed. Macaulay was charged with
supreme impertinence, vilely bad taste
and various other things. He couldn’t,
or at all events he didn’t, reply, but there
are allusions to the matter in his “Life
and Letters” showing that he felt the
criticisms keenly and was quite ready to
ac j m j t that he had been guilty of a betise.
Last week Jimmy Thomas was arraigned
f or a WO rse breach of good manners,
with a flavor of lese-majeste, in that he
had appended his name to the royal wed
ding certificate immediately below tnose
Q f t he bride and ’groom and before that
Q £ the King. “A mere accident,” ex-
plained . the offender breezily. ? “Some-

Jearnes : There are genetals (in
Australia), writes r.P. (B 5/1 _/ 4),
who hang on to their titles though they
have never heard a gun fired in earnest,
The ex P lanat,on 1S that Australia has
never been a military country. In Eng-
land no reputable newspaper gives any-
body but a “regular” (serving or retired)
a military or naval title. Consult any
old volume of “Punch” and you will
find jokes at the expense of volunteer
colonels and generals—a reflection of the
contempt the British feel for social lm-
postors. Conscript nations, such as
France, definitely forbid civilians who
served in the Woild War, and returned
1° civil life, to use their war-time titles,
England guaided against the con-
tingency by giving non-regulars tempor-
ary commissions. A few publicity-
seekers tried after the Armistice to hang
on to their war-time titles—earned often
in back areas—but a barrage of jibes
about “temp, gents.” soon put their heads
down. The Romans established the prin-
ciple over 2000 years ago that none but
professional soldiers has a right to mili-
tary titles. For that reason Claudius,
though commander-in-chief, wore his
Senator’s gown on ceremonial occasions
till he was 53. He didn’t command
troops till the invasion of Britain.
“13th Batt.”: I agree with “T.P.” Some
of our General Chokes don’t even know
the rank they’re supposed to hold. One
old gentleman who hasn’t commanded
anything for a generation or more has
figured in the same daily of late as
General Blank, Lieut.-General Blank,
Major-General Blank and Colonel Blank.
I doubt if that record has ever been
beaten, even in the U.S.A.
* * * *
“Ibn el Issar”: The Indianisation of
the Indian Army is presenting unexpected
problems. There has been a tremendous
rush of candidates for admission to
Dehra Dun, the Sandhurst of India. Of
the big batch this year, “a small number
was exceptionally suitable,” a fair num-
ber was little less so, but the rear was
brought up by “a great number of can-
didates who, both physically and men-
“Well, my dear lady, it’s a clear case of fallen arches.”
tally, were utterly unsuited to the career
of a commissioned officer in the Indian
Army.” It is the old story —show a cer-
tain type of Indian an examination and
he will attempt to pass it. The rush of
C 3 material to Dehra Dun suggests even
that the Bengali Babu, most inveterate
of examination wallahs, has abandoned
his traditional fear of militarism and
rushed to seek the bubble reputation, in
the Indian A.S.C. at least.
* * * *
“Mug Gunner”: I read recently that
poison gas was employed in Arabia to
cope with a severe locust invasion, but
my experience makes me reluctant
to credit it. When swarms of locusts
flew over Heliopolis and a billion or so
of the winged gluttons descended in the
Palace Hotel gardens (then No. 1 Gen-
eral Hospital) Gyppo and Arab gar-
deners armed with petrol-tins and sticks
strove by din to keep the insects on the
move. We patients joined in, and began
cutting swathes in the flying horde with
switches. Immediately the followers of
the Prophet downed tins and became hos-
tile. The situation grew strained, and we
were ordered to withdraw. The true be-
liever thinks it a crime to destroy the
fly that chews his eye, the louse that
chops pieces from his person and the
locust that gorges his crops.
* * * *
“Lex” on the law of it:
The British Protestant Alliance is said to
have written to the King and the Prime
Minister claiming that the wedding of Prince
George and Princess Marina was illegal “in
that portions of the rejected Prayer Book of
1928 were used.” When the House of Com-
mons threw out the “new” book the Dean of
Lincoln wrote to the “Times” (17/12/’28):
“Of members for English constituencies
there was a majority for the measure of
21; whereas of Scotch and Welsh members
there was hostile to the measure a major-
ity of 54.”
Saklatvala, the Indian Communist M.P., V9ted
against the book; the Catholic Ms.P. refrained
from voting. The Dean’s conclusion was that
the Church of England had been “denied its
freedom” by members of “other denomi-
nations outside England”; and as other Eng-
lishmen agreed Anglo-Catholic practices have
prevailed ever since. Lord Birkenhead
(“Times,” 19/12/’2B) wrote: “Any clergyman
can with complete impunity adopt the substi-
tuted Prayer Book,” and concluded:
“If I were the Archbishop of Canterbury
I should receive such a menace [threats of
legal action by Kensitites] with the most
complete composure.”
In brief, the B.P.A. has found a mare’s nest.
The Duke and Duchess of Kent are well and
truly married.
* * * *
“Farleigh”: If the Paraguayans have
really knocked the stuffing out of their
Bolivian neighbors in (and over) the
Gran Chaco, as recent cables suggest, it
shows that Providence isn’t always on
the side of the big battalions. Bolivia is
at least ten times the size of Paraguay.
Its population is over three millions,
whereas that of Paraguay falls a lot short
of one million, and, considering that both
countries began to fight two years ago
in similar transports of patriotic enthu-
siasm, it is only reasonable to assume
that the bigger of the two could put
three men into the field for every one
its enemy could scrape up. On the
other hand, Paraguay has a far more
stimulating military record and tradi-
tion than any other South American re-
public. In 1865 it tackled Brazil, Uru-
guay and the Argentine simultaneously
—much the same as if Montenegro had
taken on the rest of the Balkans—and
made things distinctly unpleasant for its
huge antagonists in the first year or two.
In the end, of course, it was worn down,
but five years elapsed before Lopez was
killed and it threw up the sponge.
Bolivia, apart from civil wars, has done
very little fighting. But what beats me is
why chaps like Kisch and Griffin, in-
stead of braving tests in Gaelic in Syd-
ney, where nobody wants war, don’t head
for Ascuncion and La Paz, where there
is apparently a strong prejudice against
settling national differences in any other
way.
* * * *
“W. 8.”: That article on “The Poor
Clerk” (B. 28 /11 / ’34) should serve to
disillusion a lot of people who imagine
the professional man to be roll-
ing in wealth. The average medical
practitioner works perhaps three times
as hard as the clerk for about the same
return. How do I know? I’ve tried it!
Admittedly the upper ten among the
sawbones make big money, but they earn
it. One of Melbourne’s leading surgeons
visits hospitals in the a.m. ; otherwise he
couldn’t cope with his work. It was after
one of these nocturnal prowls that a
harassed sister was heard to exclaim,
“Does that man ever sleep?”
**. * *
“Butcher’s Carter”: It will take a lot
to persuade me that “nine-tenths of the
people who send bad money on further
travels have no idea that it is worthless”
(B. 28/9/’34). I’ve collected quite a few
dud coins on my rounds ; they nearly
always come to me on Saturdays, when a
man is bustling with the week-end orders
and handling too much money to scan it
carefully. People are touchy, too ; they
take a lot of convincing that a coin is
crook. Then there are the folk who hand
you back a bad coin and swear blind you
gave it to them with their change, though
you are just as certain you didn’t. If you
don’t exchange it for a good one you
are quite likely to lose a customer.
* * * *
“Tartarus”: There was an outburst
of protest in Melbourne when a County
Court Judge assured a juvenile witness
that there was no such thing as hell. A
little later Dean Inge, in a syndicated
article published in the “S. M. Herald,”
said precisely the same thing in some-
what more scholarly language without
apparently ruffling any susceptibilities.
H. G. Wells in his autobiography goes
further ; he finds in the dogma of the
Christian religion a mixture of Egyptian
and Syrian myths. Nevertheless, one
Sydney cleric claims Wells as an ally
of Christianity—as he undoubtedly is.
Fifty years ago there was nothing too
bitter for conventional English people to
say about Bradlaugh because he claimed
the right to affirm instead of taking an
oath he considered meaningless. Yet
when Bradlaugh was dying a few years
later he had made himself so widely
recognised as an ally of Christianity that
prayers for his recovery were offered in
churches. The record of a man’s life
and influence is quite capable of out-
weighing his lack of orthodoxy.
A FRANK ADMISSION.
“Mr Weaver, Minister for Health, told the N.S.W.
Assembly that a cowardly hospital board outback
had appealed to him to come up and deal with the
matron, who was addicted to going gay a bit too
often. ‘We haven’t the guts to sack her, the letter
concluded.”
Did she give a trifle too free a rein
To her joie de vivre, I wonder.
Did she rip convention’s rules in twain
And the Grundy creed asunder?
Did she snap her fingers at those who chid
When she made the pace a cracker?
Ah, well, no matter! Those things are hid.
The fact remains, whatever she did,
They hadn’t the guts to sack her.
Was it chivalry’s laws that bade them pause
F.re the axe in hand was taken,
Or haunting fears of a woman’s tears
That saved the matron’s bacon?
Or was it the grace of her form and face
Made stern resolves grow slacker
To pull her up when she went the pace?
Conjectures all, but in any case
They hadn’t the guts to sack her.
They watched her “going gay,” the dame.
In a way that made them whistle,
But all the same they were never game
To hand her a curt dismissal.
So they wrote the Minister straight and true,
Without any frill or lacquer:
“She’s over the odds; but it’s up to you
To put this little business through.
We haven’t the guts to sack her.”
N.S.W.

POLITICAL POINTS
Twenty hours or so out from Oakland,
California, on a projected flight to Syd-
ney in an Airspeed Envoy (British) ’plane,
Charles Ulm and two companions, Little-
john and Skilling, lost their way in bad
weather and had to descend to the
ocean. Their last coherent radio mes-
sage was:
Come and pick us up! ’Plane will float
two days.
Then came six minutes of SOS calls —
and silence. Uncle Sam has had scores
of ’planes, surface vessels and submarines
out searching for the three Australians.
It is recorded that “army ’planes flew
all one night in murky weather in the
hope that flares might be seen.” The
American is a great and generous fellow
when his imagination ia touched.
Canberra has always had a blind eye
and a' deaf ear for proposals that Kings-
ford Smith and Ulm should be added to
the strength of the R.A.A.F. or the Civil
Aviation Department. But when Ulm
and his mates had been missing for
four days the Prime Minister blurted out
that the Government (without, of course,
bothering to get Parliamentary authority)
had backed their hazardous adventure
with an £BOOO guarantee. How charac-
teristic !
R. T. Ball, the patriarch of the N.S.W.
Assembly—he is 77—is out with a pro-
posal that members should be elected for
five years instead of three. Ball is a late
recruit to the Cocky party, and in 1932
he beat another Cocky candidate for
Corowa by one (1) vote. But let cynics
pause; unlike Butler in S.A., the old
gentleman is agreeable to the electors de-
ciding the matter one way or the other.
A Canberra galleryman mentions that
when Archie Cameron gave notice of
the expulsion motion that wasn’t debated,
Garden and his pals “searched the files
for war-time speeches of former Labor
members now associated with the Gov-
ernment,” Something must have hap-
pened to make the U.A.P. go at the
knees, but surely it wasn’t that.
Australia gets a lot of unsolicited ad-
vice from Anglican bishops as to the
conduct of its affairs. It is queer that
their wealthy church should manage its
own business so badly as to permit a
subscription to be taken up in a secular
newspaper for the widow and children
of a clergyman who was a missionary for
20 years, and who was proceding to a
charge in Sy'dney when he died. Perhaps
provident and superannuation funds and
life assurance are regarded as devices of
“capitalism,” which the bishops denounce
so much.
Perth has a sewerage system of sorts,
but it is not big enough for Labor, so
the Collier-McCallum Government is to
transform and extend it. McCallum says
only a million will be required. He has
been tartly reminded that the Canning-
road was to have been concreted for
£40,000 and ran away with £130,000 —
£.16,000 a mile —and that Herdsman’s
Lake was to have been drained for
£25,000, and carried £250,000 into the
Indian Ocean. Public-works costs esti-
mates are seldom realised ; hardly ever
in Westralia.
McLachlan, the P.M.G., has ideas
about goldmining, and recently said
that Australia could “dig itself out of
unemployment and depression.” Most
other politicians seem to think it could
be done by digging sewers.
Checks have been given in two States
to the practice of blithely setting up milk-
control boards to create famine in the
midst of plenty. South Aus. has been
saved from one by the Leg. Council,
Queensland from the other by the
Labor Caucus, though in each case the
respite may be temporary. Queensland
Labor is in favor of milk control on
general principles, but not when it would
mean raising the price to the consumer
just before a general election.
Perth elects its Mayor by direct vote
of the ratepayers and householders, a
much better method than a sordid
wrangle round the council table, such
as annually rages in Sydney. There
were three candidates the other day, and
the choice fell on J. J. Poynton. He is a
nephew of Melbourne’s Lord Mayor
Wales and a brother of Alick Poynton,
who was member for Grey (S.A.) for
21 years and one of Hughes’s Ministers;
but he has earned distinction on his own
account. He manages the Midland rail-
way, and, though his customers are
largely farmers hit by the price-slump
and there is a competing Government
line, he has made it pay.
These traffic blocks will occur.
One Frank Albert, who made pots of
money selling sheet-music and mouth-
organs, is back in Sydney from Russia,
his birthplace, with glorious news about
the U.S.S.R. It has 8,241,921 square
miles of territory and 165,768,400 people,
and he never saw a beggar there. Every-
one was working, well dressed and well
fed, and Russia may be “on top of the
world in five years.” In that case it
might conceivably regain Mr. Albert as
a resident. He would be a frightful loss,
but Australia might survive it.
How utterly contemptible the pre-
selection business can be is illustrated by
the opposition in Woollahra (N.S.W.) to
Levy, 33 years a member and five times
Speaker, and in Gordon to Bavin, 17
years a member, three years Attorney-
General and three years Premier. By all
means let them be opposed if the U.A.P.
has better men ; and it could endorse a
dozen superior persons (superior in their
own minds) for either constituency with-
out danger of losing it. It prefers to give
a few-score malcontents the power to
pass two loyal supporters and faithful
public servants out of public life regard-
less of the electors —about 20,000 in each
case.
Lang, on a bleak night at Newcastle,
where his supporters are few and dis-
spirited:
The Movement is not rich. It has no
wealthy financiers to contribute between
£lO,OOO and £20,000 to its funds.
Still it had one wealthy enough to lend
between £ll,OOO and £12,000 to the
“Labor Daily,” and influential enough to
exempt the mortgage debenture from his
10 p.c. tax on mortgagees —though not
sufficiently powerful to make that levy
on capital law.
Except that Hungarians are being ex-
pelled from Yugoslavia by the rulers of
that country, still seeking to avenge the
murder of their king, the news from
Europe is rather better. France and Ger-
many have reached an understanding as
to the compensation to be paid to the
French if the people of the Saar de-
clare for reunion with Germany, as both
countries evidently expect; moreover,
both countries agreeing, Britain is to
send troops into the Saar to keep order.
Only the Beaverbrook press objects to
J. Bull’s policing of the plebiscite, and
foreign opinion generally applauds it.
The news from Asia is rather worse.
Japan is bent on denouncing the Wash-
ington naval agreement, though France
and Italy have refused co-operation.
Japanese militarists demand equality on
the seas with the U.S.A., which
has twice as many people to pro-
tect in the homeland, and look like
getting their way. With their many
admirable qualities, the Japanese have
few friends. The effect of their demand
may be to isolate their nation completely.
More or less splendid isolation may have
been practicable for Britain in the nine-
teenth century, but it is not practicable
for any country in the twentieth.
Kirov, one of Stalin’s lieutenants, has
been shot by one of his own crowd. The
familiar Red butchery followed —the
assassin and his family, “members of the
Leningrad 0.G.P.U.,” alleged “borjoice,”
alleged Czarists.
Courts at Moscow sat for 24 hours
trying suspects, and there is an execution
every few minutes.
The stunned silence with which the in-
formation was received in these parts was
broken by Bishop Burgmann, of Goul-
burn, with the assurance that “there is
no need for a violent revolution in Aus-
tralia.” That’s a comfort, especially as
revolution is particularly perilous to
bishops. The more Burgmannlike they
are before it breaks out the harder they
have to run.
Assistant-Treasurer Casey says the
Commonwealth is unlikely to refund
to the Grenadier Guards the tax which
Queensland extracted from them, because
such a procedure would be “unprece-
dented and probably illegal.” Unpre-
cedented, no doubt; illegal, possibly
(though our Parliaments have a knack
of legalising illegalities in taxation mat-
ters); dangerous, certainly. Once a tax
was surrendered as a matter of justice
thousands of plundered Australians would
demand that justice should be extended
to them.
The time allotted for consideration of
the Commonwealth estimates was 121
hours. For two expensive departments,
the G.P.O. and the railways, H hours was
allowed. This is the Government’s way
of showing its vast respect for Parlia-
mentary control of the public purse.
As a belated concession to the public,
Melbourne Tramway Board is going to
experiment with motor-’buses; it intends
to put two on the Bourke-street route,
now “served” by cable trams that came
out of the Ark. Diesel engines ate to
be used, and these may be operated by
crude petroleum. The Country Roads
Board has for some time been using
crude Australian oil to drive trucks, and
reports excellent results.
On a population basis Westralia will
get much the biggest whack of the wheat-
bounty and farm-relief money. Just
when the Commonwealth Government is
about to extract the bulk of it from the
inhabitants of the effete East, the cables
bring news of a pamphlet ih which
secesh delegates Colebatch (English) and
McCallum Smith (Scotch) assure mem-
bers of Parliament that “manufacturing
centres throughout Britain will share
with W.A. the manifold benefits accruing
upon withdrawal from the Federation.”
Have these politicians no Australian feel-
ing at all?
“Grasspan”: It is odd to read of the
help given by Lord Sempill, the last
lone airman from England, in the organ-
isation of the Japanese and Greek aerial
forces (B. 28/11/’34). What’ variety of
brains must be possessed by an author-
ity which encourages or permits its ex-
perts to assist a Power which may some
day become an enemy? Of course Aus-
tralia has no fear of attack from a
friendly country like Japan, but the
Greeks may swoop on us any day.
In Queensland in 1891 44,537 married
women under 45 produced 14,000 chil-
dren ; in 1921, 89,771 produced 19,274
children. In 1932 only 17,367 children
were born to nearly 100,000 married
women. In no mainland State does natu-
ral increase reach 10 per 1000 p.a.; in
Victoria it is 6.01 —less than hall the
Federation year figure (12.55). W. M.
Hughes quotes these figures. By 1968,
he considers, the birth-rate will be over-
taken by the death-rate.
From a man with a union ticket:
The trammies have passed out their Minor-
ity Movement candidates in Sydney and de-
feated those who had got a footing in the
Vic. branch of the union. In the meantime,
M.M. men were chosen by the coalminers.
There seems a moral here for politicians.
Regular work kills revolutionary talk, even if
the wages are on the low side.

Poetic injustice has been meted out to
W. Creswell O’Reilly. Though a Kur-
ingai alderman for donkey’s years and
a mayor more times than Dick Whit-
tington, ratepayers censored him, so to
speak, at the municipal elections.
The result staggered Pymble, where the
Commonwealth Censor’s friends would
have laid three to one on his return if
they hadn’t been opposed to punting on
principle. Mr. O’Reilly’s father was a
resident of Pymble before him.
Flight-Lieut. Ulm was one of those
born adventurers who only outlive their
youth by accident. He enlisted at 16,
and was fighting hard on Gallipoli at an
age when many lads are at school.
Twice wounded on the Peninsula, he was
discharged as unfit, re-enlisted, and was
wounded twice in Flanders. His record-
breaking flights with Kingsford Smith
are history. After the closing down of
Australian National Airways, he and
Smith parted business company, and the
public heard of him chiefly through his
Tasman flights. He crossed the Tasman
four times. He had all the qualities de-
manded of a great flying-man, not-
ably an icy nerve which enabled him to
think clearly in any emergency and what
cross-country riders call “beautiful
hands.”
Mat Charlton, formerly Federal leader
of the Labor party, has been elected
alderman of his home town (Lambton,
N.S.W.). Lambton is one of the pocket-
handkerchief municipalities which are
now muddling through in the Newcastle
district. Greatly improved in health
(bowls having helped considerably), Mat
will be a big acquisition to the local
council, and the expected advent of a
Greater Newcastle Council next year may
offer wider scope for his ripe experience.
M.L. and S.A. are exchanging bankers.
W. D. Young, manager of the Commer-
cial in Adelaide for the last eight years,
moves on to Dunedin, and is succeeded
in Adelaide by R. H. J. Camm, from
Christchurch.
R. J. Rossiter, the latest Westralian
Rhodes scholar, provides an interesting
link between the States. He Was born,
like his father and grandfather, in S.A.
They were educated at Prince Alfred Col-
lege (of which a near relative, Dr. James
Mitchell, of Sydney, is thought to be the
oldest scholar now living). R.J. first went
to school in Brisbane ; then he passed on
to Wesley in Perth, of which his father,
Dr. J.L., is now head.
A. M. Blain, who succeeds Harold
Nelson as voteless member for the N.T.,
comes of a s.-w. Queensland pastoral and
droving family. Born in ’94, he went to
W.A., matriculated for Adelaide Uni. in
science, enlisted at 21 in the 51st, was
wounded at Messines and Mont. St.
Quentin, returned a sergeant in 1919,
qualified as a surveyor in Queensland and
practised all through the North, which he
knows like the palm of his hand. A lean,
wiry chap with a pleasant personality, he
will make a good Minister for Territories
one of these days if he gets his chance.
He has been staff surveyor to the North
Australian Commission for five years.
“Austral Celt” contributes a religious
item:
It used to be said that Archbishop Mannix
wasn’t persona grata at Rome, but facts give
the story its answer. Here is a list of priests
who have been promoted to the episcopacy in
recent years: Barry (Goulburn), Ryan (Sale),
McCarthy (Bendigo), Foley (Ballarat), Hayes
(Rockhampton, Q.), O’Collins (Geraldton,
W.A.). All got their training on the Yarra,
and most of them under the personal direction
of the Archbishop. Now it is understood that
Melbourne-born Norman Clack, president of
the Australia-wide Manly union of priests
and organiser of the recent Eucharistic Con-
gress, is to be Bishop of Port Augusta, S.A.
If so, he will be the first A.I.F. chaplain to
reach the purple, though perhaps the most
popular of them all with the Diggers—Tom
King, of Sydney—became a Monsignor.
“D.”: Guy Innes, London representa-
tive of Melbourne “Herald,” has an odd
distinction. He is the only Australian in
or out of England who gets fairly regu-
lar “mentions” in the Week-end Competi-
tions of the “New Statesman and
Nation.” There is no money in these
events, but they are entered for by most
of Britain’s wittiest highbrows. Innes was
editor of the “Herald” before Keith
Murdoch.
Dr. Eric Barbour, who died in Sydney
last week, was the perfect sportsman.
He had a natural aptitude for games.
Before the war cricketers used to debate
whether he was most useful to his side
as a bat, bowler or field, and tennis
players claimed that he would have been
an international if he had put his mind
to it. He played cricket for N. S. Wales
from 1908 onwards, and he was a mem-
ber of the A.I.F. team that did so well
in England. But it was his attitude to-
wards sporting contests that made him
beloved. A great loser and a great
winner. He had a profound knowledge
of cricket, and his judicial articles about
the game were interesting reflections of
his balanced temperament.
MACARTNEY ABBOTT.
Here is Macartney Abbott, Senator-
elect, grazier, solicitor (to the N.R.M.A.,
amongst other bodies) and member of
one of N.S.W.’s oldest families. J. H. M.
Abbott, writer of many Bulletin yarns,
is a brother. Macartney Abbott repre-
sented the Upper Hunter during the war
(Murrurindi, his birthplace, is in the con-
stituency) ; said he would resign if con-
scription wasn’t carried, and \yent out
of politics as a result.
“J.”: W. H. Kelly, who returned to
Sydney via the U.S.A. last week, spends
a good deal of his time abroad, belongs
to the Marlborough Club in London and
the Travellers’ in Paris, wears an O.E. tie,
and, in general, resembles an Englishman.
As against which he is a dyed-in-the-wool
Australian who is pugnaciously ready to
take his country’s side whether the issue
is bodyline bowling, barracking or the
national accent. This is where he differs
from most Australians who are mistaken
for Englishmen abroad. He represented
Wentworth in the Reps, for some years,
and was Acting-Minister for Home
Affairs before the war. T.H., an elder
brother, helped to found Koala Park and
showed the Duke over it. F.S., the
youngest' of the family, was killed on
Gallipoli.
“Jeames”: Sir Archibald Weigall,
who is touring Australia in the interests
of the Royal Erppire Society, stands
alone among Australian ex-Governors
in at least one respect: he began as
an estate agent. His father, who was
an artist, married into the Westmorland
family, and had six sons; Archibald,
the fifth, got a job on one of the West-
morland properties in Northampton-
shire. He married the only daughter of
Maple, the Tottenham Court-road furni-
ture magnate, ten years later, entered
Parliament a year after his marriage, and
was a member of various boards during
the war. The Royal Empire Society, of
which Sir Archibald is chairman, used
to be the Colonial Institute in South
Kensington.
• Oddity from “C.H.E.”:
A paragraph referring to Foursome’s win
in the Newmarket (B. 7/3/’34) was read by
one William A. Schipps, a botanical explorer,
in the wilds of Central America. He wrote to
the owner of Foursome, A. E. Michael, of
Snowtown (S.A.), from Stann Creek, British
Honduras. They had played together as child-
ren in the Barunga Gap district 30 years ago,
and neither had heard of the other since.
S.A., deserting its old policy of send-
ing mature Rhodes scholars to Oxford,
has chosen J. J. Pritchard, who, at 18,
is a third-year medical. He has won
honors at Pulteney-street, St. Peter’s
and St. Mark’s. Rugby and rowing on
one side and nervous diseases on the
other are his strong points.
Lord Riddell, proprietor of. London
“News of the World” (a Sunday paper
called “Smut of the World” in Dublin
and not allowed on Free State bookstalls),
has died ; and the barony which he was
given in 1920 for his war services dies
with him. A tall, lean, pallid man with
delicate features, his ascetic looks belied
his conversation, which was of the mer-
riest description ; and he was a social suc-
cess in spite of his Cockney voice. He
claimed to have known everyone of im-
portance in the world of his day ; and he
knew some of the most important people
very well indeed. When not attending to
his huge business interests or writing (his
“War Diary” was a masterpiece of its ego-
tistical kind, and he wrote brilliantly on
his special subjects in the “Encyclo-
paedia Britannica”) he was usually play-
ing golf at Walton Heath. He was Baron
Riddell of Walton Heath —the first peer
to take his title from a golf club.
Melbourne’s new Lqrd Mayor Wales
had maturity thrust upon him as a boy.
His father lost his sight in an accident,
and young Wales had to provide eyes for
his parent in running a big suburban con-
tractor’s business. The father was an
alderman at the time, and the son helped
in that sphere, too.
“Aussie’s” farewell to a steed:
For more years than hundreds of now-re-
spectable Sydneyites (ex-roysterers who rarely
reeled home till morning) care to remember
Old Fred’s horse has drawn the Caf 6 de Fair-
fax to its stand beside the “S. M. Heiald”
office in O’Connell-street. The animal had
become as much an identity of the night life
of the city adown the decades as any human.
Now Fred (his name isn’t Fred, but everybody
calls him that) has decided to replace his
timeworn prad with another. There was some-
thing Olympian about the stolid tolerance
with which the horse used to view fuddled
offers of pies and suchlike refreshments, and
then resume operations on its feedbag. Cali-
gula, it is recalled, proposed to make his horse
Incitatus a Senator. Old Fred’s steed is
superior in many respects to the average
M.L.A., and now its admirers will be pleased
to hear it is to be rewarded with a comfort-
able paddock and no work.
Jonathan Cape is visiting all the Aus-
tralian States “to find out why outstand-
ing books by Australians are not appre-
ciated in their own country.” No one
can accuse him of not practising what
he preaches. He discovered (through
The Bulletin) Dr. MacLaurin, of
Sydney, whose “Post Mortem” was a
best-seller in England and the U.S.A.
before the war. (Incidentally “Post
Mortem” set a world fashion in medical
essays.) Mr. Cape did more than any
other Englishman to bring Lawson be-
fore the British and American public at
a time when Henry was almost unknown
outside N. S. Wales. There are many
specimens of Lawson at his best in
“Capajon,” an anthology of short stories
which was published by Cape the other
day.
S. F. Diddams, of Bendigo, is prob-
ably the greatest tennis player who ever
managed an Australian bank. He is now-
running the local branch of the Bank
of N. S. Wales. He began his career
there 44 years ago: since then he has
won most of the honors open to Vic-
torian tennis players. He and A. W.
Dunlop won the Vic. doubles five times.
Golf is another of his games. Though
due to retire this month on the score of
age he won the open championship of
his district three years ago.
“Jeames”: Sir John Barnewall, Bart.,
an octogenarian who came to Melbourne
from Thornton Upper (Vic.) for the
congress celebrations, has a romantic
family history. He is descended from
an Englishman, Michael de Barneval,
who arrived in Cork in the twelfth cen-
tury. Cromwell confiscated the whole
of the family possessions except a castle
and 2000 acres of land. John Barnewall,
father of the present baronet, emigrated
to Victoria just on 100 years ago, and
his brothers went to America at about
the same time. The family, whose
haughty motto is “Malo mori quam
faedari” (Death before disgrace), claims
to have been Catholic, man, woman and
child, in face of many disabilities, for
eight centuries.
Headed by the Artists’ Society’s presi-
dent, Louis McCubbin, Victorian artists
are offering gifts of their work in aid
of the flood sufferers. Fine pictures have
already arrived from John Longstaff,
Herbert' Mclnnes, Wheeler, Rowell and
a dozen others. They will be on exhibi-
tion for two days at Melbourne Fine Arts
Gallery, and on December 14 will be
auctioned at the gallery.

TREAD
TYRE
Barnet Glass “Checkskid” is a tyre designed especially for today’s
gruelling traffic conditions —of high speed travel over harder,
smoother road surfaces.
Its extra breadth of tread, which contains more actual rubber, gives
extra road grip '. . . extra safety . . . extra mileage. Its extra
depth of tread gives longer non-skid tyre-life . . . increased
economy ... immunity from skids and slipping.
In Barnet Glass “Checkskid,” you also get the advantages of
heat resisting design, which reduces the tendency to generated
heat, the main cause of tyre destruction; unique carcase
construction, which gives extra sidewall flexibility; and superimposed
buttresses which strengthen the shoulders and support this new
“more-rubber” tread.

Net. earnings exhibit a stubbornness
rhat has been overcome by most other
traders. Briefly, that is because returns
J om advances, some of which are appar-
ently turning in nothing at all, and from
Consols, Treasury bills, call-money, etc.,
have contracted faster than the cost of
deposits and overhead generally. Never-
theless, the co. may have done better
than the increase of £123 in last year’s
declared profit suggests.
A growth of £5,523,279 in deposits,
due largely to the rise in the price of
wool, was accompanied by a net expan-
sion of only £1,700,817 in advances, while
£2,787,209 was added to low-interest-
bearing liquids:

Premises 820,000 1,800,000 2,300,000 2,400,000
Though business generally improved,
savings continued to run ahead of in-
vestment. Plainly, what the bank needs
is more sound borrowers. When the
books closed, advances had dropped to
72.8 p.c. of the deposits as against 75.6
p.c. and 76.8 p.c. at the two preceding
balances. Liquids mounted to 44.6 p.c. of
the liabilities to the public as against 43.8
p.c. and 42.3 p.c. in ’33 and ’32 respectively.
Banking averages for September show
that the proportion of the co.’s interest-
bearing deposits in Australia dropped to
70.7 p.c. as against 72 p.c. a year earlier.
In the exchange market, where the co.
does a large business, turnover was
brisker.
The disposition of liquids compares as
follows:

£40,861,696 £43,648,905
Cash, etc., which earns nothing, increased
by £3,561,281. Unprofitable London
call-money was reduced by £1,730,000,
and Treasury bills were down £3,734,373,
due to funding operations. There was a
growth of £4,664,318 in public securi-
ties ; this appears to have occurred out-
side Australia.
Taking the mean between the amount
of public securities and Treasury
bills held at the beginning and end
of the term, and assuming that the
average return from the former was 3-y
p.c. and from the latter 2\ p.c., then the
two sources combined turned in
£698,050. The year’s tax bill (income,
land and other taxes) was £68,406 lighter
at £185,811. Deducting the whole of
this, the net return from the two sources
referred to was £512,239, or £72,500 more
than the profit claimed from all sections
of the undertaking. According to the
published figures, appearances are, there-
fore, that the remainder of the business
was conducted at a loss. That was after
an unspecified amount had been struck
off the book value of premises and
something set aside for bad and doubt-
ful debts and other contingencies.
The £439,739 of profit was 2.9
p.c. on shareholders’ funds (capital and
reserves combined), or 5 p.c. on the
£8,780,000 of capital alone, as against
5, 5.3, 7.5, 9.8, 13.3, 15.8 and 17.3 p.c.
back to 1927. The div. was kept at
5 p.c.; until a little over three years ago
the co. had never paid less than 9 p.c.
sine the old co-partnery closed its exist-
ence in 1850.
At £32 17s. 6d. the £2O paid shares
return 3 p.c. on a 5 p.c. div. basis. The
investor who looks for a shade over 4
p.c. on his money counts on a 7 p.c.
distribution.

Australia’s wheat cheque for 1933-34
(£8,597,680) was about half the previous
year’s. Still, business generally was
better, which might be taken to mean
that the co.’s extensive merchandising,
shipping and other agency business turned
in a bit extra.

Exes, took £58,484 of the increase. After
passing £lO,OOO to the staff fund, enough
remained to pay the pref. div. (£25,000)
and then show 4.8 p.c. on the £1,500,000
of ord. capital as against a loss for the
two preceding years and profits of 0.7,
12.3 and 24.1 p.c. back to 1-929, when
the figures benefited by a windfall from
Bawra. The div. was kept at 5 p.c., and
it is difficult to say when better can be
expected.
The co. finances its activities largely
on debenture capital—£4,3s2,lol at June
30. Including a half-million of share
capital, carrying a fixed cumulative 5
p.c., there was £4,852,401 costing the
co. on the average 4.2 p.c. During the
boom years this fixed-interest-bearing
money was cheap, and very helpful to
the ords. —they received a regular 17 p.c.
for the half-dozen years to 1929 ; now it
stands in their way. Including debenture
interest (£179,660) and the contribution
to the staff fund, the year’s net earnings
(£287,235) were approximately 3.6 p.c.
on the debenture and share capital and
reserves combined (= £7,981,579). An-
other lion in the path, especially for Eng-
lish shareholders, is the depreciation of
Australian and Maoriland currencies.
Over the last four years, exchange has
cost the co. £407,076, of which £304,814
has been met by transfers from the re-
serve for contingencies, lumped with
sundry creditors in the sheet. The charge
against last year’s earnings was £102,262,
equal to 6.8 p.c. on ord. capital; it was
about £33,000 more than the cost of
converting debenture interest and divs.
from Australian and M.L. currency into
sterling.
Sydney prices the £2O ords. paid to £5
at £9. Exchange makes a 5 p.c. div.
worth 6| p.c.; the return at £9 is thus
3.4 p.c. The prefs. seldom come on to
the market. In London the debentures
are selling around par.
Balance-sheet figures reflect the year’s
better trading, and suggest preparation
for further extension of the co.’s activi-
ties: —

Formed in 1930, this holding co. (paid
capital £2,439,912) exchanged 2,416,499
of its pound shares for scrip with an
aggregate paid-up face value of
£1,696,797 in half a dozen of the lead-
ing wholesale drug houses in Australia:
A. M. Bickford and Sons (Adelaide and
Brisbane), Elliotts and Australian Drug
(Sydney), Felton, Grimwade and Duerdins
(Melbourne), Felton, Grimwade Dental Co.
(Melbourne), Felton, Grimwade and Bick-
ford (Perth), Taylors, Elliotts and Aus-
tralian Drug (Brisbane, Rockhampton and
Townsville).
At June 30 its only other assets were
advances to subsidiaries, £26,600 ; divs.
declared by subsidiaries but not paid,
£52,764 ; equipment, £25. The idea was
to reduce both competition and over-
head, as well as gain advantages on the
buying side. But slump upset calcula-
tions, and divs. have been modest, the
best being 3£ p.c. for the last term. The
outlook, however, is improving.
For the first two years the operating
cos. sent along more than they earned,

At June 30 the outside debt visibly
amounted to £542,549, of which £363,115
(down £95,978) was interest-bearing. The
continued reduction of this ftebt and of
stocks and the comparative steadiness
of debtors’ balances are encouraging
signs. The improvement in the more or
less liquid surplus (£1,020,513, including
stocks) was £43,605.

Trade and other developments left the
business overcapitalised. To reduce the
liability in this respect, the board worked
down stocks and debtors’ balances —the
Adelaide warehouse was closed in 1929.
Thus the co. has been able to reduce
the overdraft, repay the debentures
(£150,000, held in London) and, during
the last term, return £162,500 of the pref.
capital (10s. and ss. per share respectively
to the firsts and seconds), reducing the
•figure to £287,500 in 100,000 firsts and
187,500 seconds. The divs., which re-
main cumulative, have been reduced to
5 p.c. firsts and 6 p.c. seconds, with the
right to advance to the original rates
(7 p.c. and 8 p.c. respectively) with the
ords., after the latter have had 6 p.c.
Arrears of divs. to Sept. 30, 1933, were
paid mostly at half the new rates, the
amount to June 30, 1933 (£30,000), being
charged direct to reserves. To wipe out
a p. and 1. debit of £133,545, together
with £1264 of legal exes, in connection
with the return of capital, ss. per share
(£152,258) was slashed off the ords. That
left £17,449, which has been specifically
reserved against goodwill (£71,480), not
treated as an asset herein.
The year’s contraction in the more or
less liquid surplus (£599,570, including
stocks) was £192,801:' —

To meet payments to the prefs. aggre-
gating £208,125, cash and investments
were drawn upon for £135,555 net,
debtors’ balances were reduced by
£35,225 and stocks by £10,550, while
£11,471 was added to the outside debt.
Surplus earnings, including the allow-
ance for depreciation, provided the
balance.
Trading resulted in a profit of £14,478
(up £12,808), or £1772 less than a full
year’s minimum pref. divs. now call for.
It is difficult to say when the ords., who
have gone without for the last five years,
are likely to get into the picture. With
the growth of the Australian textile in-
dustry and development of the specialty
house, chain-store and other retailing
methods, the softgoods wholesaler has
seen much of his business slip away.
The market prices the firsts at 18s.
and the seconds at 18s. 3d. At these
figures the return is 5.5 p.c. and 6.5 p.c.
respectively on the basis of present mini-
mum divs. The net tangible cover is
£8 os. Id. firsts, £3 14s. Bd. seconds and
225. sd. ords. The ords. are not listed.

Busy Little Bears
For the last couple of months bears
have paid special attention to Sunshine
Gold Development, a Sydney concern
with interests in New Guinea and Papua,
and, amid raids and squeezes, the price
of the 10s. shares has fluctuated violently.
A bear may, of course, be a perfectly
genuine speculator, backing his opinion
that the price of a stock will fall, just
as a buyer mostly backs his opinion that
it will go higher. There is thus nothing
wrong about actual buying or sell-
ing forward. There may be a great deal
wrong with tales told in order to in-
fluence the market.
The backbone of Sunshine’s leases
is the Consolidated Claims, about 130
acres, on the Watut River, below its
junction with the Bulolo. This area
includes four blocks, of which Gold-
foil, test-bored by Olaf Moen, is figured
to contain 1,066,300 c.y., worth £190,800
with gold at a premium of 80 p.c.
Recent drilling has disclosed a further
898,680 c.y., averaging 22.3 d., making a
total of 1,965,000 c.y., averaging 22.6 d.
Another 200,000 yards remains to be
valued. It is proposed to treat the ground
by hydraulic sluicing, and costs are put
at from 6d. to 7d. a yard. Results will
partly depend upon recoveries, and what
they will amount to remains to be seen.
The board erred in not immediately
subjecting the untested portions of the
Consolidated Claims to an intensive
boring campaign. Instead, it turned its
attention to a possible dredging area of
some 3000 acres on the Ono River and
to other claims.
Alluvial Gold (Australia) has taken a
six months’ free option over Gympie
Gold Dredging’s claims on the Mary
River (Q.), with the right to a six months’
extension on payment of £5OO. If the
option is exercised, the vendor co. gets
£5OOO cash, plus its expenditure on the
property, together with a 25 p.c. fully-paid
share interest in any co. formed to work
the area. Some 30 bores put down by
the optioner have disclosed about
2,000,000 c.y. of approximately Is. 3d.
dirt. Values vary greatly, owing to a
displacement which has occurred over
a width of 700 ft. back from the river
frontage towards Powers’ Gully, lodg-
ment taking place wherever the tendency
to scour was retarded.
* * * *
White Hope Central has abandoned its
option over the Golden West and Golden
North, at Cracow (Q.) —the “rich” shoot
became unpayable at a depth of 167 ft.
On the recommendation of H. G. W.
Keid it has decided to test two shows
(Mt. Tymns and the Cosmopolitan-
Howley) in the Northern Territory. At
Mt. Tymns the old workings extend for
1000 ft. on the surface. There are two
reefs; average value of crushings 17dwt.
by amalgamation; costs are put at £2
10s. At the Cosmopolitan-Howley 4436
tons of free milling ore, mostly from
opencuts, yielded 30680 z. Both pro-
perties (they are about 20 miles apart)
are to be tested at depth by the drill.
Those on the register are being asked
for another 6d. per share for the pur-
pose.
He * * *
Golden Dyke, the Sydney co. which is
opening up the old Shackle mine, about
112 miles south of Darwin, has met with
trouble in its 50-ton-a-day treatment
plant. The recovery from 1090 tons of
crudes, head value 7dwt., was only about
3dwt. The difficulty is said to have been
overcome, and a 90 p.c. extraction is now
looked for. From the surface to the
100 ft. level it is figured that there is
250,000 tons of ore assaying from 9dwt.
to 13dwt.
* * * *
From London: Purchase of an interest
in Gold Fields Australian Development,
which owns the adjoining Moonlight
group, negotiations for enlargement of
the treatment plant in order to handle
Moonlight ore, payment of divs. half-
yearly, an increase in ore reserves by
253,900 tons to 1,786,000 tons, averaging
28s. 6d. a ton, and an assurance that
the co. had nothing to fear by way of
any marked decrease in the value of
its golden product were the outstanding
points of chairman J. A. Agnew’s spe&h
at the Wiluna meeting. He made it cleai
that Wiluna had no intention of per-
forming any of the functions of a mining
finance house, outside those pertaining
to its own subsidiary, Wiluna Gold
Mines, Ltd. The transaction with Gold
Fields Development will open up pros-
pects of closer co-operation between
neighbors. It is of utmost importance
that competition in connection with
labor and the supply of materials should
be obviated by a close co-ordination be-
tween the two concerns, the chairman
says.
Opinions differ as to the value of
Pomme d’Or (W.A.). The official one
is that a clean-up of at least 150 tons
will probably take place fortnightly. The
ore is easily mined, and 10s. a ton should
cover all costs. Although it is hard to
give an estimate of ore in sight, a mining
engineer (name not given) reckons that
there is at least 10,000 tons between “the
grass roots and the 100 ft. level.” Another
opinion expressed in Perth mining circles
is (1) that the show is small and of the
hand-to-mouth variety, (2) that insuffi-
cient development has been done to
justify any calculation of ore reserves,
(3) that the permanency of the deposit
hangs by a very slender thread, (4) that
calls are likely to be more frequent than
dividends. Many would welcome a re-
port by an independent expert.
* * *••• *
Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie, Ltd. (sub-
scribed capital £600,000), has paid
Gold Exploration £120,000 cash for
several blocks with a past on the east
side of the Golden Mile, and has agreed
to spend money freely before March,
1936, in exploration. J. F. Thorn, gen-
eral manager, and R. F. Playter, geologist,
of Lake View and Star, will be technical
consultants, and R. Annan, a nominee of
New Consolidated Gold Fields, and P. E.
Marmion and W. S. Robinson are on
the board.
* * * *
Two of the big goldmining cos. in
Westralia have adopted the S. African
policy of bringing down the grade of ore
treated with every rise in the price of
gold, and others are tipped to follow
suit. This policy prolongs the lives of
mines at the expense of current divs.,
and for that reason is unpopular with
short-term speculators, who argue that
increases in the price of gold are not
sufficiently reflected in monthly returns
from the mines.
* * * *
Associated Gold Mines has left Kal-
goorlie and thrown in its lot with the
Associated Mining and Finance Co.;
which is mostly interested in some West-
ralian gold and Canadian gold and silver
ventures. Associated Mines shareholders
are to receive 2s. (cash) per share and
one Associated Mining and Finance Bs.
share for every two shares now held.
* * * *
The Mt. Magnet Co., which is attracting
attention in London, owns the old Hill
60 at Magnet (W.A.), and is controlled
by a select crowd. Developments at
depth have enhanced the value of the
property, and the board proposes to
liven development and extend the recently
installed treatment plant.
* * * *
Two new Westralian finds have proved
disappointing. Bulk assays at Sattah’s,
about 125 miles east of Laverton, dis-
covered by a ’Ghan camel-driver, aver-
aged ldwt. 12gr. a ton. A sample from
the show prospected by “an aboriginal
named Sullivan” at Yerilla went 3dwt.
12gr. a ton. Possibly Mr.-Sullivan really
lighted on “Lasseter’si lost reef.”
* * * *
Great Boulder Prop. (W.A.) has
announced another development. This
time it is in the Hamilton shaft, 1950 ft.
level, on the X lode south drive, south
of the main east crosscut. Stripping on
the east side has disclosed a body aver-
aging 14ft. in width.' Assay values are
17dwt., with free gold and telluride.
* * * *
The Blue Bird, alias Yarri, an Adel-
aide concern, has taken over Matthies-
sen’s Blue Bird mine, at Norseman, on
the Phoenix line of reef. During the
past 12 months the owners have crushed
two rich parcels. One of 40 tons re-
turned something like 110 oz., while an-
other of 20 tons yielded 2590 z. over the
plates, with 2oz. in the sands.
* * * *
Tributors on the Patricia leases, owned
by the Kimberley Option Co., have
treated 142 tons of ore at the Yarri State
battery for 200 oz. of gold. Shareholders
are wondering why the mine was handed
over when such values were available.
* * * *
Triton has decided to equip its prop-
erty at Cue (W.A.) with a 60,000-ton-p.a.
mill, which is expected to start up about
July next.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
K. 8.5.: (1) Little chromite is used in Aus-
tralia for hardening steels. Steel manufacturers,
however, use this mineral as a refractory for
furnace linings, and there is a fair demand for
this purpose. (2) £3 7s. 6d. per ton of ore,
assaying 40 p.c. chromite oxide, plus Is. 3d.
per unit over this figure. (3) Try Vickers-
Commonwealth Steel Products, Waratah,
N.S.W H.K.: (1) Blasting gelatine, about
92 p.c. nitro-glycerine. Handle very carefully.
Do not expose to sun,, which might cause

tenant-Governor of Westralia, explained
to a group of sceptics that he had
thrown in his first line with nothing
more tempting in bait than the flesh
of a magpie. I have had two ex-
periences which would confirm the story.
At Bunker Bay, Cape Naturaliste, the
first three of a big catch of sea herring
quite greedily swallowed hookfuls of
crowflesh, while in an estuary at Bun-
bury two of us hauled in 14 crafty bream
that had shown a fatal partiality for a
fruit diet. We had been eating musca-
tel grapes, and fish darting at the dis-
carded skins and refuse gave us the idea.
In further attempts we used up a couple
of pounds of succulent berries, but they
brought no luck.

“Aralia”: Work by Prof. Ewart in
Melbourne seems to blow out the yarns
about wattle seeds germinating after thou-
sands of years, and also the “mummy”
wheat, sold by Gyppo guides to trusting
tourists. Of seeds stored for periods up
to 105 years, very few germinated after
15 years, those mostly of the pea, water-
lily, stock and mint families. Peas live
longest, but the trend of observations
indicated that the longest possible span
is 200 years. The maximum for wheat
is 25 years; the ordinary expectation of
even a few survivals in any given sample
not over 10 years. Seeds buried in the
earth may remain dormant for long
periods, but the very oldest which have
generated were those of a water-lily from
a Manchurian lakebed, estimated from
erosion and other signs to have been at
least 120 years old, and at most 400.
The evidence is against wattle seeds sur-
viving after 120 years at most.

“Nifty”: Touching those Australian
flowers which belie Gordon’s claim that
this country is a land where bright blos-
soms are scentless (B. 28 /11 / ’34), let me
enter for the competition a handsome
yellow flower which grows on a fleshy,
creeping plant on Queensland and other
tropical beaches. The attractive blossom
has a scent calculated to turn the stom-
ach of an African aasvogel, and one
which it is quite impossible to describe
in print.
* x * *
“Scrooge”: The yarn in a recent issue
of the Westralian who buried a bundle
of notes only to find that the salt in
the soil had reduced them to fragments
recalls a story of a Chinaman who was
even more unfortunate. He was one of
a lot of Chinese passengers returning
home from the Queensland goldfields
some 60 years ago. Their ship, the
Changchow, was wrecked on Sandy
Cape, and when this chap’s body was
washed ashore it had 301 b. weight of
gold on it. The sovereigns were in a
long leather bag worn crosswise round
chest and back and tied round the waist.
Most of the other Chinese were rescued
and held at Maryborough for the next
steamer. Among them they were carry-
ing £20,000 in sovereigns and raw gold.
“F.Y.7”: The Newcastle butcher who
was kicked in the mouth (B. 28/11 /’34)
by a dead bullock recalls Andy Macfar-
lane, the old Scots carpenter on a Barcoo
station years ago. A bullock in the
killing-pen made a break for liberty by
trying to jump the Bft. fence. The for’ard
end of him got over, but he hooked a
hind leg through one of the lower rails
and hung, head down. To save trouble
he was shot and bled in that position,
“Come on, Gandhi! Fight it out like a white man!”
and Andy was called in to cut out one
side of the mortise which held the rail
so that it could be released and the bul-
lock with it. Andy got busy, blissfully
oblivious of the fact that he was stand-
ing inside the pen in the track the rail-
end must take when loosened from the
mortise. That happened presently, and
the leverage of the bullock’s leg, backed
by the weight of his carcass, shot Andy
the whole length of the pen. He finished
up with two ribs and an arm broken.

“Ivory”: Another great abo. natural-
ist in “Crosscut” (B. 28/11/’34) has
arisen to support the Call an Park claim
that snakes have legs. He says there
are four, which are con-
cealed in sockets in the
snake’s side, and are only
revealed when the serpent’s
corpse is put on the fire.
What “C.” saw were evi-
dently portions of the snake’s
intestines forced out through
the skin by the heating of
the internal gases, as hap-
pens with other animals in
like circumstances. I hereby
promote “C.” to Class Z of
abo. natural-history observ-
ers. He shares that proud
possie with the people who
have observed that the young
kangaroo grows on the teat,
that snakes swallow their
young and that a large and
ferocious species of wild cat
roams the Australian bush.
* * *
“Bahadur”: The elephant
is the prince of opportunists.
Recently an Aboliar told
how a party from a circus
descended on a newly-planted
avenue of trees specially de-
signed as part of Wagga’s
welcome to the Duke of
Gloucester and ate the lot in
a night. Now comes news
from Westralia that two ele-
phants performing at the
Blackwood Agricultural
Show slipped into the dining
marquee and sank the “cold
collation” prepared for the
show potentates when their
labors in the ring were over.
They don’t seem to have
touched the bottled stuff, how-
ever, so there was still balm in Gilead
for the hungry yeomen when they gath-
ered at the feast.

“G.G.6”: “Simpering Jane” (B.
28 /11 / ’34) should change the first word
of her pen-name to “Gibbering” if
she makes any further effort to prove
that the laughing jackass “is rarely
found off part of the coastal water-
shed.” She saw only one on the Barcoo
in three years. In cold fact, Jack is as
numerous west of the Dividing Range
as he is east of it, and is nowhere
thicker than in the Barcoo coun-
try. But he is a lover of open gum-
forest country, and does not frequent
wide, open plains and downs or thick
scrub like the cypress-belar or dogwood-
gidya combinations. One Jack and his
Jill made a stretcher-bearer case of me
once in south-western Queensland. I
was passing under a gum in which a
pair had nested. My mount was a newly
broken colt, and when the birds de-
scended in a series of vicious swoops
round my head I warded them off with
wild swipes of a big, flapping hat. There
was a convulsive movement under me,
and the next thing I recalled was some-
one’s voice asking if I could drink out
of the waterbag which was held to my
lips.
* * * *
“Jaen Eille”: Talking of eels, Dar-
lot’s Creek, sou’-west Vic., is crawling
with them. On a summer night I’ve seen
the banks dotted for miles with the fires
of fishermen’s camps. Not just local
lads out to crack a bottle, but carloads
from Hamilton, Port Fairy, Portland—
even as far away as Horsham. Many
catches of hundreds of eels have
been landed by one party in a single
night. Incidentally, what time of year
do eels migrate seaward to breed? They
never seem to leave Darlot’s Creek ; and
in midwinter their presence has inspired
a pastime calculated to produce an even
hardier race than the Vikings of old. You
equip yourself with a hurricane lamp, a
heavy piece of hoop-iron and a bag, don
your oldest boots and trousers and set
out after dark for the nearest water-
covered flat. The crawlers are not hard
to locate, and a blow from the hoop-iron
“slasher” puts ’em in the bag. A couple
of hours’ wading should provide a good
fish breakfast; that is, if you don’t die
of pneumonia before morning.
“Airline”: I’ve had considerable ex-
perience with eels, but here’s my weird-
est. A small creek I knew of always
yielded a good haul of the slimy ones at
night, although during the day it was
useless trying to locate ’em. Noticing
they usually travelled downstream, one
night we ventured into the boggy mass of
springs from which the creek flowed.
The largest spring was a very fast-flowing
one, surging a foot above the surface
of the surrounding water. We were
astonished to find it absolutely spouting
eels! For several nights we had great
sport there with the spears, but by some
subtle subterranean telepathy the word
was quickly passed round, and the eels
became cautious. They would come to
within a foot of the surface, glare pug-
naciously at us, and, with a sinuous
swirl that churned the crystal waters
into foam, disappear once again into
the depths. Apparently they made the
vast artesian belt that underlies much of
Canterbury (M.L.) their home.
YOU CAN’T MISS IT.
If you ever lose your bearings on a lonely road
outback,
And ask some chap you meet to be directed
To a pub or railway station or a distant
settler’s shack
That you find is further out than you
expected,
It’s a moral, whether you’re at Bungaree or
Balingup,
That the bushman you rely on for assistance
About the route to follow with these words
will finish up,
“Yer can’t miss it —keep straight on—it ain’t
no distance!”
“ Yer can’t miss it 1” —later on that sentence
grates,
And through your liard-clinched teeth you
fairly hiss it;
'though you’re feeling tired and faint, like a
famous make of paint
Just ‘‘keep on keeping on,” and you can’t
miss it.
You’ll be there “in almost no time” , if you
take the handy cut
That your friend in need proposes you should
follow;
Strike across the ringbarked paddock till you
reach the splitter’s hut,
Then hit out along the path to Smoky
Hollow;
Cross the creek at Noonan’s orchard and go
up the big red hill,
Then proceed along the line of least resist-
ance
Till you come out by the tea-tree just beyond
Maloney’s mill,
And when once you strike the road “it ain’t
no distance.”
When you’ve covered miles of country and
your legs begin to ache,
And with barley-grass and burrs your clothes
are littered,
You determine that this “short cut” is the
last you’ll ever take,
And against your bushman guide you feel
embittered;
But it seems there’s nothing for it but to
grimly plod along—
There’ll be surely a reward for your persist-
ence ;
As your legs keep growing weaker so your
language waxes strong,
And in scoffing tones you mutter “ ’Tain’t
no distance!”
"Yer can’t miss it,” there’s a landmark just
ahead:
"The old black stump”—you feel inclined
to kiss it;
Now you know you’ll soon arrive—four more
miles, or maybe five !
A trifle in the bush, and . . . ‘‘Yer can’t
miss it!”
VICTORIA.

“Susu”: Marine Board inquiries into
cases where vessels have encountered un-
expected rocks would be greatly simpli-
fied if the practice of those hardy sea-
men who navigate the big trading canoes
about the Admiralty Islands and n.-e.
Papua were followed. One peril of the
deep which they take into account is a
live rock which jumps from the sea-
bottom at canoes. Owners, too, who
feel it necessary to keelhaul skippers
and engineers on account of tardy pas-
sages would be more considerate in view
of the fact that, if a skipper’s wife should,
during his absence, step aside from the
path of strict marital virtue, it will slow
his vessel. The wives need have no fear
that their husbands will seek romance on
some far island. There are lots of Circes,
whole islands full of them, but any un-
lucky mariner who lands on such a
Papuan Paphos is torn to pieces at once.
At least, so the wives are told.
* * * *
“Cuchulain”: The black sheep turning
white is not really- an uncommon occur-
rence (B. 21 /11/ ’34). In a black sheep
if the staple is, say, two inches long,
there may be a band of white wool about
an eighth of an inch thick. So if the
shearing is done evenly and it happens
to be the right time to strike this white
section you get your mysterious metamor-
phosis. It just depends when the shear-
ing is done. I’ve seen quite a lot of
such cases of whitewash by nature.
* * * *
“Jindivick”: “Spare Walton” (B.
14/11/ ’34) can’t have had much experi-
ence of fishing in the Thames (Eng.). A
greater variety of fish abound in that
old river than in any Australian water-
“What sort of boay is ’e, Tummas, yawnin’ first thing in the mornin’?”
“Boay edden yawnin', cap’n; ‘e’s tryin’ to say somethin’.”
way, despite the thousands who fish
there every year. In size they run
from gudgeons to pike, weighing more
than 301 b. In between come carp, bream
and tench, commonly taken at 101 b.
weight; barbel and chub, often turning
the scale at 151 b. Roach and dace are
game little fighters weighing from Boz.
to Thames trout certainly do not
come up to their Australian cousins for
size—old-man pike sees to that; and the
Thames does not turn out codfish of
1001 b. and more. Nevertheless, on the
whole, Father Thames can hold his own
almost anywhere in the matter of fish.
* * * *
“Bray Rock”: Old hands of Bribie
and fishing hamlets northward still
treasure glorious memories of the Bris-
bane flood of 1893. A few of the chairs
from the Aquarium at Doughboy
Creek are still extant, but it was not fur-
niture that they risked their lives for in
the boiling surf and smothering foam of
that memorable week. Many a barrel of
beer, many a cask of rum, many a case of
whisky was salvaged and hidden in the tea-
tree. Even in recent years an odd bottle
or two have appeared from some wind-
blown dune, to gladden the heart of a
dry worm-catcher and cause his wife to
wonder how he got from Dickie Beach
to .the pub and back in the time.
“Cripes! Wish this rain means another
of them floods like ’93,” said my old
friend Dan. “Us blokes was merry for
months on wot we planted, and the Johns
never got a smell of it.”
* * * *
“M.L.C.”: In what minute portion of
its anatomy does the bee keep its sense
of taste? This is a vexed question among
apiarists. Insects keep their organs in the
queerest places. Crickets, for instance.,
have their ears in their front legs, grass-
hoppers in their tummies, mosquitoes in
their antennae and bees in their knees.
Now, a U.S. professor says the Red
Admiral butterfly tastes with its feet
and a bee can taste, as well as
hear, with its knees. That is to
say that when a sugary
touches the knee of a bee an immediate
reaction is observed in nose and tongue.
This correlation would naturally save a
great deal of time in locating the nectar.
* * * *
“Bogaduck”: I have a nest of much-
travelled ants in my yard. I left my
truck standing for two days at Port
Lincoln (S.A.) last year, and during that
time a colony of ants camped between
the tyre-rim and the wheel-felloe. Driv-
ing home by way of Port Augusta and
Adelaide, a distance of 600 miles, I was
astonished to find that the ants were still
there and alive, in spite of all the pound-
ing and bumping which they had re-
ceived on the way and the number of
times that wheel had whirled them
round. But they had evidently had
enough of it, for within an hour of
stopping for the last time they emerged
from the wheel-rim, carrying a few un-
damaged eggs, and took up their abode
under a tub in the fernhouse. They are
still there to-day. There can be no mis-
take about it, for they are a species of
ant common around Port Lincoln but
hitherto unknown in my district.
* * * *
“Gryllus”: So thick are invading
hordes of grasshoppers in the Warwick
(Q.) district that they are interfering with
the running of the rail motor-train be-
tween Goondiwindi and Dirranbandi. It
is no new difficulty for Queensland rail-
waymen ; not long ago a plague of eater-
pillars caused several trains to be can-
celled in parts of the Warwick district,
the squashed cadavers making the rails
so slippery that the wheels could not get
a grip.
* * * *
“Wodao”: What bird keeps its baby
treble longer than a magpie? Our pet,
now two years old, still calls like a fledg-
ling when given fresh meat. Her main
“Razor pulling at all, sir?”
pastime is following broody hens;
though she has no designs on the
chickens she gets a plucking whenever
caught by the ducky one. When in
such difficulties her baby-like calls bring
wild maggies to her rescue.
“J.F.L.”: A magpies’ nest across the
road, with four in the nursery, was
picked as a resting-place by a big swarm
of bees. The parent birds, with about
20 helpers, began to attack the seething
mass; though the fighters- killed a few
insects they couldn’t force the stingers
to move away. Their buzzing drowned
the appeals of the fledglings, who two
hours later, when the swarm dispersed,
were found to be dead.
* * * *
“Ume”: N.S.W. may soon be groan-
ing under an emu pest in addition to the
grasshopper burden. The other day a
solitary emu descended on a country
golf course and swallowed a couple of
dozen balls in short order. If the news
spreads to the great outback that pills
at 3s. each are delightful hors-d’oeuvres
we may expect an emu invasion of the
eastern littoral on the lines of that which
some time ago threatened the embattled
farmers of Westralia’s Midlands. That
State was compelled to call in the assist-
ance of the military with machine-guns,
and we may yet see the guns of South
Head turned on the emu hordes raiding
Royal Sydney’s course at Rose Bay.
* * * *
“Jimmac”: The summer cruises to the
Barrier Reef are now in full swing, and,
November being the month in which
turtles lay their eggs, turtle eggs have
been figuring largely on the menu —not
as a delicacy (“general cooking pur-
poses”) but as a novelty. Trippers
who like their eggs hard-boiled are due
for a disappointment. Turtle eggs may
be boiled till the heat generates young
turtles, but they’ll never boil hard.
% * * sfc
“Wodao”: In the South Burnett (Q.)
district it is mostly gum-trees that are
affected with mistletoe (B. 21/11/’34) —
ironbarks are rarely infested. The para-
site is mostly found on gum-trees along
black soil river flats, sometimes cover-
ing the tree so thickly as to make it
resemble a weeping willow.
* * * *
. “K.L.M.”: Regarding natural increase
in hares (B. 14/11/’34), I have seen three
leverets in a squat made in a stook of
hay. In the Murray Valley I was present'
when a doe hare was shot and dissected ;
five young in embryo came to light. It
only remains for hares to take to burrows
now to become as big a pest as rabbits.
* * * *
“H.H.H.” (Fiji): Has any Aboliar seen
a dog catch and kill a mongoose? The
’goose is a vicious little devil when cor-
nered, but he can’t kid a dog as he does
a snake. The boys in Suva catch them in
a trap fashioned with a fixed noose, a
whippy stick and a section of the giant
bamboo, baited with meat, and turn
the captive loose to fight' a dog
for general amusement'. For the first
half-dozen combats ray Irish terrier
gave the impression that it was all
rather boring, but he changed his mind
one day when he took a grip too far
from the neck and the mongoose got
him by the upper lip. It died hanging
on, and it took us an hour to catch
the dog to release him. Nowadays he
spars more carefully, but always wins.
* * * *
“Aragnib”: Saw a fox and a crow
pitted against each other. The four-legged
one was determined to carry off a pois-
oned rabbit, but his feathered foe was
equally determined to prevent him ; each
time Reynard seized the rabbit and tried
to make off with it he was attacked from
above. Frantic leaps served only to
drive the crow out of reach ready to
renew the attack as soon as the booty
was touched again. Ten minutes of this
gave neither an advantage; it was about
this time they both spotted me.
* * * *
“Drawback”: At Chillundie (S.A-)
railway barracks we were cooling off after
a hot day. The old mother-cat was about
to go on her usual hunting trip when one
of her latest offspring, an almost fully-
grown tom, decided to accompany her.
Mother objected, but Tom persisted, so
the result was a very rough fight. Tom
stopped home. As this was the
first time anything like this had hap-
pened, curiosity prompted me to follow
Puss. I came upon her 200 yards away
on a rabbit warren, quietly watching two
tiger-snakes. Instinct or just a fluke?
* * * *
“Somnus”: Net-fishermen in the salt-
water lakes of southern Bananaland
spend their working days (except in mid-
winter, when they use a mesh net) up to
their shoulders in water, and never swim
a stroke. They wade from boat to net,
etc. Swimming, besides being strenuous,
might frighten the fish.
* * * *
“Meno”: I want the name and address
of that Aboliar who advised throwing
your hat down to occupy a snake’s at-
tention while you searched for a waddy.
Right across my path the other day lay
a four-foot black-snake, and down went
my hat right in front of its nose. That
snake seemed to turn inside out
about half a dozen times, and then
came to rest coiled like a spring, its
head about a foot from the hat, and
a look on its face as much as to
say “Blink an eye and you’re a goner.”
Returning with a long stick from about
100 yards away, I found to my disgust
that the wriggler had apparently lost in-
terest in my headgear and had dis-
appeared. I threw my weapon away and,
muttering curses on the aforesaid Abo-
liar’s head, picked up my hat. Next
minute passed in a dream. Men work-
ing on a relief gang a quarter-mile away
reckoned they heard my yell. I was
covered from head to foot' in one mass
of wriggling, bucking, slashing serpent.
I came to about 100 yards from the spot;
in my delirium I was making good time
towards the pub.
NOCTURNE.
In this deep valley all is still,
Save for the laughing of a rill
Playing at leapfrog o’er the stones,
A restful music in its tones.
The perfect beauty of the night
Enswathes the world in deep delight,
But when it would my soul beguile,
I sense a nigger in the pile.
A wagtail’s chatter through the gloom
Of Nature’s one enormous room
Intensifies the mystery
Abiding on all things that be,
And calling to the poet-soul
To seek in fancy-flights its goal.
And I would seek —if there were not
An insect in the ointment pot.
O’erhead the stars are like bright bees
A-swarm above the blossomed trees,
’Mid which on moonbeam-palfreys
prance
The shining cohorts of romance.
A night it is of placid joy,
Or would be, save for this alloy:
I’ve had a lengthy workless spin,
And all my shirts are wearing thin t

EATEN OUT.
Dad’s brow wrinkled ominously as he
read the “Outback Times.” “Blast the
pests!” he roared ; “first the rabbits, then
the wallabies, and now I see the grass-
hoppers are cornin’ this way.”
“They can’t do much damage to us,
anyway,” soothed Dave.
“My husband does enjoy these little picnics. They allow
him to live again the open life of his droving days.”
“Why can’t they?” exploded Dad.
“What if they get in the corn, man!”
Dad was awakened next morning at
daylight by Dave. “They’re here, all
right. They’ve eaten the corn, too!”
“Eaten the corn! Not all of it,
surely?”
“Yairs,” drawled Dave, “every inch of
the two stalks the wallabies left.”

CONCERNING CHRISTMAS GIFTS.
Always choose your gifts early—the
earlier the better. I usually get mine in
January when the shops are throwing
them out at suicidal prices to get rid of
them. Certainly there’s not such a good
selection then, but what does that matter?
I’m buying things to give away, not for
myself. Furthermore, by this method 1
can make sure that I don’t waste any
presents, as last Christmas is still recent
news and I can remember exactly who
remembered me.
“Ah!” I say, “Cousin Alfred gave me
a miss this year. That’s the end of him.”
So off the list he goes. You see the value
of this. If I left the business until
December, ten to one I’d have forgotten
all about it by then.
“Let me see,” I would murmur, think-
ing hard, “who was it slipped me up
last year? Was it Joe or Aunt Agatha?”
As likely as not I would decide it' was
Joe. Result —no present for Joe, which
means that I’m off his list in future, while
Alf gets a present out of me under false
pretences.
Furthermore, under this system one
has more money to spend on oneself at
Christmas. This may be thought selfish,
but it is nothing of the soYt. Christmas
is the season of
good cheer, and
how can a man
be filled with
good cheer when
he has just spent
all his spare cash
on gifts for
others?
It wouldn’t be
so bad if the
presents he re-
ceived himself
were conducive
to good cheer,
but: 14 pairs of
socks, two dozen
handkerchiefs and
11 neckties when
viewed in a heap
are a depressing
rather than a
cheering sight.
Nevertheless, in
choosing gifts for
a man it is best
to stick to these
three items. Any-
one giving a pre-
sent not intended
for the feet, nose
or neck (always
excluding books)
is rightly re-
garded with sus-
picion.
Don’t choose
socks or ties that
you would like
yourself, or you’ll find before the
end of the year that you have appro-
priated them to your own use. With
handkerchiefs this is almost certain to
happen. I. never give handkerchiefs.
A considerable sum can be saved by
a judicious use of the ties and socks you
received last Christmas, provided you
labelled them carefully at the time to
avoid the possibility of giving one back
to the person who gave it to you. Many
people are very careless on this point.
There is one tie that I have received
every alternate year since 1924. In the
intervening years I have given it to five
different people, and if it doesn’t turn up
again this Christmas I’ll feel like one who
has lost an old friend.
I have confined these remarks to
presents for men. If approached in the

the wise man will abstain from such
practices.

TIT FOR TAT.
“Patients who do not like the behavior of
their doctors should retaliate in kind.”
— “Telegraph.”
Dr. Hackupp opened with a smart grab
at Measley’s pulse. The latter countered
with a beautiful thermometer thrust
right under the doc.’s tongue, and fol-
lowed it up with a nippy sounding of
the right lung. The doc. brought his
stethoscope into action, but the patient
gained a big advantage with a well-
timed “Say ninety-nine.”
Realising, no doubt, that it was a seri-
ous case, Hackupp resorted to chloro-
form. Once again Measley held his own
with some sharp instruments belonging
to his adversary. There was a wild scene
as the two combatants struggled round
the theatre. An appendix or two floated
through the air before the doctor’s leg
was amputated. Then with one of those
brilliant flashes that have characterised
his career, Dr. Hackupp finished the con-
test. He placed his bill right before his
patient’s eyes. Measley, realising that
there was no answer to that, went out
to it.

THE IDEAL CHRISTMAS DINNER.
After years of experimenting I have
evolved the ideal menu for an Austra-
lian Christmas dinner, and I now offer
the public the benefit of my experience
This menu is suitable for any part of
Australia where the temperature is likely
to rise above 90deg.
To start with, I recommend as an
appetiser
a bottle of beer,
followed by
a sandwich.
Then, in this order,
a bottle of beer,
a sandwich,
a bottle of beer,
a bottle of beer,
a sandwich.
(Bonbons may be pulled at this stage.)
Then
a bottle of beer
(bring in Christmas pudding),
a sandwich
(take out Christmas pudding),
a bottle of beer.
Then perhaps, as a savory,
a bottle of beer,
and afterwards in the garden—or, if
there is no garden, then anywhere that
is convenient —
a bottle of beer.
Sam,
CRAMPED STYLE.
I have a wife with modish views —
Her stockings, gowns and hats galore
And lingerie and gloves and shoes
Would amply stock a modiste’s store.
I have a loughboy broad and tall
(’Twas bought to hold my shirts and
socks
And sundry clothes), but nearly all
Its space is claimed for slips and
frocks.
And though with harems Turks are
blessed
(Or cursed —this point has caused
disputes ),
If more than one wife I possessed
I don’t know where I’d hang my suits !
P.O.M.C.
CHRISTMAS EVE TRAGEDY.
“Certainly, Snodgers,” said the man-
ager of Mammoth Stores. “Borrow the
rigout by all means.
You’ve been the best
Father Christmas
we’ve ever had, and
the job’s yours every
year if you want
it.”
Snodgers thanked
him gratefully.
“Just want to give
my own youngsters
a treat for Christ-
mas Eve,” he an-
swered as he stuffed
the Santa Claus cos-
tume into a suit-
case.
Leaving the store,
he made his way
through the busy
streets thronged
with merrymakers.
Everywhere the
spirit of goodwill
was in the air.
After standing
cheerfully for three
sections in a crowded
tram he at last
reached his home.
His wife greeted
him eagerly.
“Have you got
it?”
“Yes.”
“That’s lovely. I told the little dears
that Santa Claus would be coming, and
their stockings are hung up ready for
you.”
After supper Snodgers donned the
familiar garb. For nearly a month it
had been his workaday suit, and he had
handed out presents, pats on the head
and kindly smiles to thousands of
children.
Now was the opportunity to gladden
the hearts of his own kiddies.
Together they walked to the door of
the children’s room; then Snodgers
pulled up dead and looked blankly at
his wife.
“What’s the matter, dear?” she asked.
“Confound it! I’ve forgotten the
presents.”

CATES ON THE ROOF
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BY EDWARD HARRINGTON.
DRAWINGS BY TED SCORFIELD.
The street where I board is a forest of flats,
And it’s cursed by a plague of most insolent cats.
As soon as the sun has sunk down in the west
They all sally forth on an amorous quest.
A tomcat will call from the top of a roof,
A second will answer from somewhere aloof;
Then others arrive, and the concert begins
As they slither and slide on the tiles and the tins.
Cats on the roof,
Cats on the roof,
Amorous, clamorous
Cats on the roof,
White ones and yellow ones,
Black-as-Othello ones,
Oh, the Devils in league with the cats on the roof.
They talk of the need for our country’s defence,
But it wouldn’t involve a great deal of expense
To put on the market some new sort of bombs
To hurl at the tabs and the turbulent toms
Who gather in numbers that nightly increase
To shatter our slumber and slaughter our peace.
An inventor will surely make plenty of oof
Who can deal with the menace of cats on the roof.
They climb and they clamber, they hiss and they wail,
And they go up and down on the musical scale.
A shy young soprano will start on a note
While the ardent old tenor is clearing his throat.
Then off they will go on a dainty duet,
And the bass will come in when the tempo is set;
And any young student of sharps and of flats
Can learn quite a lot from a chorus of cats.
Then all of a sudden the tempo will change—-
They really possess a most wonderful range,
From alto, contralto, falsetto and bass;
Caruso and Melba are not in the race.
The tenor will rise on a note of his own
And the bass will die off to a horrible moan.
Oh, I doubt if the patience of Job would be proof
’Gainst amorous, clamorous cats on the roof.
A lull may occur when the midnight is past,
And you think you are set for some slumber at last,
But just as you’re dozing, your face to the wall,
The concert will end in a general brawl.
And you’ll turn on your pillow and mentally vow
r To kill ev’ry cat that you meet with from now,
Till morning comes in with a dusting of mats,
And another night’s rest has been ruined by cats.
Cats on the roof,
Cats on the roof,
Amorous, clamorous
Cats on the roof,
White ones and yellow ones,
Black-as-Othello ones,
Oh, the Devils in league with the cals on the roof.


A BATCH OF GOOD YARNS
1 Rollicking
Comedy:-
AGOANNA-OIL COMMERCKIL
BY BERNARD
CRONIN.
.... and
Scrubby gets
going on “Sweet
Marie” like he
hadn’t seen her
for years.
SAID Billy the Breaker:
Old Dave, what died the other
day at Dinny, used to cook for the
Grahams on Comeback station, and a
damn good cook he was, be the same
token. They always sent for me soon
as the rains come for to break a young
’orse or two, and I got to know the
Comeback crowd like a dog knows its
own fleas.
Comeback was right on the track and
a famous camping ground for blokes on
the wallaby. Old Dave would always
give ’em a handout for the tucker-bag,
and Sid Graham himself, or his missus,
as like as not corfed up a pair of boots
or another blanket for the older blokes.
All sorts they was, and that regular you
could tell the seasons by ’em. Paddy
Gurr, who was overseer in them days,
would poke his ’ead in the men’s ’ut
one scran-oh, and sing out:
“We start musterin’ the flats to-morrer.
Long John’s camped down be the' big
gate.”
Or maybe he’d say: “I hear Fathead
Brown is making this way from Junee.
It’s time that lucerne was got in. Some
of youse see to it.”
It got to be so’s they wouldn’t do
nothing on Comeback unless one or
other of them old, coves showed up, like
it was turning over the leaves of the
calendar. The only time Comeback was
ever late with the shearing was the year
Tiny Bostock died in an ’aystack on the
road out from Barnes’s paddick, and
balled the whole works.
Old Dave’s pertickler pet was Scrubby
Watkins what had the gammy leg where
a tree ’ad fallen on him one time in the
Otway Forest. He was only a kid at
the time, and the rest of ’im growed up
all right, but the leg didn’t. You could
always tell if Scrubby had passed along
be the tracks he left, which was a sorter
cross between a bolting steer and the
toe-kick of an emu.
Scrubby ’ad been on the roads for so
long he disremembered how old he was.
He always made Comeback in the brand-
ing season, and Old Dave give him a
shake-down in his ’ut, and fed him
a treat, being sorry for the old bloke
more’n usual. Scrubby wore two pairs
of dungaree pants at the same time, ’is
theory being that the good parts in the
one covered the ’oles in the other, and
vicey versey. He ’ad whiskers all over
him and they was as stiff as the spines
on a Bathurst burr, and some said the
’airs had ’ooks on ’em what Scrubby
used to catch fish with whenever he came
past a crik. But I daresay that ain’t true.
Anyway, Old Dave greeted Scrubby
like a brother when ’e turned up at
Comeback, and the two on ’em would
sit chinning ’arf the night, swapping lies
about when they was young and virtoous.
Old Dave would play his concertina, and
sometimes Scrubby would sing “Sweet
Marie,” till the bottle was empty, and
they’d hold each other’s ’ands and cry,
when Paddy Gurr would send some of
the boys to put ’em to bed.
AND then for two seasons running fires
started on the 1000-acre and Come-
back lost ’arf their grass. No one knew
who done it, but it weren’t accidental,
because there was tracks found where
some bloke ’ad camped.
Young Parker, the book-keeper, found
a box ’arf full of luficers be the wind-
mill tank and took and showed ’em to
Sid Graham. Luficer matches weren’t
allowed on Comeback, and the boss went
properly crook. He sends for Paddy
Gurr and gives orders that no more swag-
gies was to be let camp on Comeback
ground, free’old or lease’old. He said
he didn’t care if it was Long John or
Bluey or nobody, they wasn’t to be let
in no more. And when Paddy Gurr
says that this was the work of a stranger
and not any of the regulars, Sid Graham
lost ’is block altogether, and says he
don’t give a damn if it was the Bishop of
Carpentaria, he’d lost two seasons’ grass
and he’d ’ave no more of it, and for two
pins he’d pay everybody off and go and
live in a brewery or a convent for the
rest of his life. And ’is missus said the
same.
And so the next thing there was big
notices done by young Parker stuck up
on the main gates and on a tree be the
Junee-road, saying as how trespassers
would be prostituted with a penalty not
exceeding fifty quid. It was close up to
the branding, and any day Scrubby Wat-
kins was due in, and Old Dave got
thinner’n a bandicoot on burnt country
thinking of Scrubby’s game leg and how
he’d never listen to “Sweet Marie” any
more, in the way Scrubby could beef it
when down a half-bottle of store rum.
But just from force of ’abit he makes
up Scrubby’s shake-down on the floor be
the flour-bin and borrows some neats-
foot from the saddler for to oil the joints
of ’is concertina. He noo Scrubby would
turn up, anyhow, for the old bloke
couldn’t read. And no more could none
of ’em, except' the cove they called The
Schoolmaster, who had been at Oxford
and could read anything when sober.
WELL, Scrubby lobs in one sundown
while Old Dave is over with the
storekeeper arguing that ’e can’t make a
side of bacon larst out longer than it do.
He chucks Matilda into a corner and is
rummaging for tucker when Old Dave
comes back.
“ ’Ow goes it, Dave?” Scrubby says.
“Pretty crook,” Old Dave says.
He goes and sits on the edge of his
bunk and stares at Scrubby.
“You’ll be a good little boy for 1935, won’t you, Tommy?”
“Yes, Mister Perkins.”
“If it’s the rumaticks again,” Scrubby
says, “I got a bottle of goanna-oil in
the Old Lady there what will work
wonders. I caught ’im be them big rocks
near Simpson’s Crik and boiled ’im down
in a jam-tin a bit at a time.”
“It ain’t the rumaticks,” says Old
Dave, wondering how he’s going to break
the noos. “It’s worse nor rumaticks.”
“You ain’t out of rum!” Scrubby says.
“Worse’n that,” says Old Dave. “Didn’t
you see them notices down be the gate?”
Scrubby shakes his ’ead.
“I didn’t come be the gate,” he says,
“I got through the gap in the fence be
the sugar-gums. What notices?”
So Dave tells ’im.
“The boss’ll get over it,” he says, com-
forting Scrubby. “He always does. But
while he’s mad he’s mad an’ we got to
humor ’im.”
“What does the notice say, when read
from left to right?” Scrubby asks, after
feelin’ ’is whiskers and thinkin’ ’ard for
a wnile. “Inere’s notices and notices,
Dave, and maybe this one ain’t spelt
right or somethink illegal like that.”
Old Dave has a copy what he took
from Parker, and he gets it out and
reads it to Scrubby. It says:
“No swagman is permitted to camp
on Comeback Property without permis-
sion in writing. Offenders will be
severely dealt with.”
“Well, there you are,” says Scrubby.
“I don’t see no ’arm in that. You can
give me permission in writin’, can’t
you?”
“Only the boss can do that,” says Old
Dave.
“It don’t say so,” says Scrubby.
“If Long John were here he’d know,”
says Old Dave. “He’s been ’ad up twice
for sheep-stealin’, and the law’s like an
open book to ’im. But, as he ain’t, there’s
nothink to be did. You can’t stop ’ere,
Scrubby. To my sorrer, I says it.”
“ ’Oo’ll know if I do?” says Scrubby.
“We won’t play nor we won’t sing. All I
asks is a bite of tucker, and maybe a
mouthful outer the bottle for old times’
sake. And then I’ll hit it for the Junee-
road, fair dinkum, Dave.”
CO Old Dave weakens, and they set to
it for a time in quite the old style.
Soon they’ve clean forgot about the boss
and his notice, and Scrubby gets going
on “Sweet Marie” like he hadn’t seen ’er
for years.
It was a still night, and Scrubby’s roar-
ing travelled clean to the homestead ver-
andah, where the boss and Paddy Gurr
were sitting talking about how the bot-
tom of the market was right out, and
how the sooner we ’ad a change of
Government the better for all hands.
Paddy Gurr knew all about Scrubby, for
he’d seen ’im goin’ into Old Dave’s ’ut,
but he hadn’t said nothink, because he
thought Old Dave and Scrubby would
have sense enough to keep quiet.
And so now, when “Sweet Marie”
opened up, Paddy Gurr was took with an
’acking corf, hoping that the boss
wouldn’t drop to things. But ’is sufter-
fuge was n.b.g. Sid Graham stops talk-
ing, and he says:
“What the devil is that noise, Paddy?”
“Some of the men having a sing-song,
Mr. Graham, I expect,” says Gurr.
“Sing-song, d’you call it?” says the
boss, taking the cigar out of his mouth
so he can listen better. “I call it an
infernal howling. Besides, I know that
tune. That’s ‘Sweet Marie,’ so it is. I
only know one man who bawls about
her like that. And that reminds me —
Scrubby Watkins is just about due.”
“It can’t be Scrubby, Mr. Graham,”
says Paddy Gurr, doing his best. “Not
with them notices we’ve stuck about.”
“If that ain’t Scrubby,” says Sid
Graham, “I’ll drink my own sheep wash.
Anyhow, we’ll go down and see. I won’t
put' up with this damned disobedience.
Old Dave can get ’is time in the morn-
ing. Am I boss at Comeback or ain’t I?”
“You know you are, Mr. Graham,”
says Paddy Gurr, thinking to soothe ’im.
But it didn’t.
So there were Old Dave and Scrubby
playing and singing fit to kill when the
door opens and in comes the boss and
Paddy Gurr, with most of the hands
tailin’ ’em up to see the fun. Old Dave
is cross-legged on his bunk, beltin’ into
his concertina in proper style. Scrubby
Watkins is lying on ’is back on the floor
with the rum bottle in one hand and
beating time with the other. He don’t
see the boss come in, and no more does
Old Dave, who always shut his eyes
when he was playing. And the noise
they are letting loose would deafen
creation.
“Not because your face is fair, love,
to see,” Scrubby sings out.
4ND then Old Dave opens his eyes
and sees Sid Graham standing in-
side the door glaring at ’im, and he
drops the concertina and puts one foot
down and fetches Scrubby a kick in the
ribs. “Sweet Marie” goes up in a water-
spout of curses, and Scrubby sits up
and sees the boss and kind of lies down
again. And dries right up.
“Well?” says Sid Graham, very savage
and polite. “Enjoying of yourselves?”
Old Dave was that shocked that ’e
was almost sober. He says yes, thanks ;
he’s doin’ pretty well. Scrubby says like-
wise, follerin’ Old Dave’s lead. He gets
up an’ hides what’s left of the rum, right
under the boss’s eye, and then sits down
an’ plays with his whiskers.
“Entertainin’ of your friends, eh?”
says Sid Graham, still as smooth as pig-
skin. “And who ’ave I the honor of
seein’ ’ere? Damn and blast your
impudence!” says he.
“It’s Scrubby,” says one of the boys at
the back, not seeing the boss’s sarcasm.
“No, it ain’t,” says Old Dave. He’d
caught sight of Scrubby’s tin of goanna-
oil what the old cove ’ad been rubbing
into his corns, and it give him an idea.
“It’s Mister Watkins, that’s ’oo it is.”
“Mister Watkins, eh?” says Sid
Graham. And then he lets go. “You’re
sacked! ” he says to Old Dave. “You go
and see Parker first thing to-morrer and
get your time.”
“What for?” says Old Dave.
“For harborin’ one of them thievin’,
grass-burnin’ swaggies after what I told
you,” says the boss. “And as for you,”
he says to Scrubby, “I’ll prostitute you.”
“What for?” says Scrubby, copyin’
Old Dave.
“For trespass,” says the boss. “There’s
millions of notices stuck around here
warning off you deadbeats. If you don’t
read ’em that’s your lookout.”
“Excuse me, Mr. Graham,” says Old
E>ave, “but you are mistook. Mr. Wat-
kins ’ere is no swagman. He’s a —a com-
mercial traveller, and there ain’t nothing
on the notice what says them sort can’t
set foot on Comeback.”
Sid Graham looks at Old Dave, and
then ’e looks at Scrubby, who’s got both
hands in his whiskers by now.
“A commercial traveller, is ’e?” says
the boss. “Then will you tell me what
the devil he’s commercial travellin’ for?”
“Yus,” says Old Dave, “I will. Mr.
Watkins is travellin’ for goanna-oil. And
if you don’t believe me, Mr. Graham,
there’s one of ’is samples right there be
the box. That’s so, ain’t it, Mr. Wat-
kins?”
“So help me, it’s a fack,” says Scrubby.
“I’ve gone into business on me own. I
caught ’im be them big rocks near Simp-
son’s Crik, and my word he was a
whopper! ”
“I thought it was you I was smellin’,”
says the boss. And then he busts out
laughin’. “Travellin’ in goanna-oil, are
you? Where’s your .peddling license,
Scrubby?”
“I left it at ’ome,” says Scrubby, be-
ginning to grin.
“On top of ’is best pianner,” says
Paddy Gurr.
“Under the wife’s pot of antipodis-
trums,” says a bloke outside.
“ ’Ear, ’ear,” says Old Dave.
“Oh, hell—all right,” says Sid Graham.
The mob cheered ’im as he ducked
away,
I wish I ’ad my time again, said Billy
the Breaker.


(2) Vivid Early-days Drama:—
THE WOMAN
OF STONEY RANGES
BY JHMABBOTT
She knew that the victory —and herself —must lie
with Black Jones unless she did something very
desperate. So she did it.
HERE we must sing a brief paean
for those brave women who
went “over the ranges”—west,
north and south of the Old Colony—in
the early years of the last century, with
husbands and brothers and fathers, to
help them in the making of Australia.
Too much have they been neglected in
the records of our history. There is no
story in all the long chronicle of
feminine heroism that is much better
than theirs. While we read papers at the
Historical Society about Captain Sturt,
and Sir Thomas Mitchell, and Alan Cun-
ningham, and Hamilton Hume, and
Matthew Flinders, and George Bass, and
Leichhardt, and the brothers Jardine,
and all the others who did great and
heroic things in unlocking the doors of
this mysterious continent of ours, we
overlook many women —some ugly, some
pretty, some strong, some delicate and
fragile, but all brave —whose only monu-
ments are sloping and weed-grown tomb-
stones in little old country burial
grounds, a faded portrait or two, some
often ill-spelled letters, and a little vague
tradition.
Those ladies had a good deal to do
with the Landing on Gallipoli and the
storming of Mont St. Quentin. Very
much indeed.
Mrs. Nottingham was a type of these
women—a type of a type, so to speak.
She was one of those delicately and
luxuriously reared early-nineteenth-cen-
tury ladies who had never known what
real hardship was until they went into
the bush to share their men’s privations
and perils. (One always thinks of Eliza-
beth Macquarie that she, too, would
have done as well as they did had cir-
cumstances called upon her to take their
hazards.) Nothing could be finer than
the way they shared them, nothing
nobler than the sacrifices they made.
It is almost impossible now to realise
off-hand what they had to put up with.
But if, Madame-you-who-read-this, the
next time you go over the Blue Moun-
tains in a first-class carriage, or through
the Riverina in a motor-car, or up the
valley of the Hunter River and over the
Liverpool Range in a sleeping-berth, or
elsewhere in such comfort as this
present-day Australia offers you, you
will recollect that ladies of as much
charm and sensibility as you yourself
undoubtedly possess went those jour-
neys, seated on bags in bullock-drays
—as Mrs. Nottingham did —with babies
at their breasts or babies yet unborn,
and only rough men, who were often
convicted criminals, to attend upon their
womanish necessities —well, it seems to
the writer that you will envy them their
valiant qualities. It is, of course, well
understood that they are latent in you
also.
MRS. NOTTINGHAM has already
appeared in person in these
chronicles —she was that Mrs. Ter-
ence Moisey with whom Ensign Calder
once fell violently in love, a brief
comedy which, it may be remembered,
ended with the spirited young widow
slashing Mr. Calder across the face with
her riding-whip. Captain George Not-
tingham, the man she married three
short weeks after her chastisement of Mr.
Calder, and whom, eight years later, she
accompanied to Stoney Ranges, was
himself a personable figure. He had
commanded one of the Honorable East
India Company’s ships, and in Bom-
bay had been wantonly provoked into
a duel with a military officer who was
on the staff of and related to the Com-
mander-in-Chief. This gentleman was
so unfortunate as to lose his life at Cap-
tain Nottingham’s hands. It is indis-
putable that the latter should never have
been brought to trial, but, owing to the
influence of the exalted relative of the
staff officer, brought to trial he was,
and, in place of the acquittal which
everyone expected, was found guilty of
manslaughter and sentenced to fourteen
years’ transportation to New South
Wales. Here he was very well treated
by Governor Bligh, before Bligh’s depo-
sition in 1808, and by the rebel Gov-
ernment afterwards. It only remained
for Governor Macquarie to make him
technically a free man, as he had been
in fact since his arrival in the colony.
In the old homestead at Stoney
Ranges their two portraits still hang on
either side of the big fireplace in the
dining-room. They were painted by
that same Read who did the miniature
of Mrs. Macquarie which is now in the
Museum at Hobart, and they show a
very handsome couple. Mrs. Notting-
ham is dark, pretty and vivacious look-
ing, with full red lips, which, however,
do not form a weak mouth, as so many
of those ripe-cherry lips do. And there
is determination in the well-formed chin,
and the tilt of the pretty nose, and the
level dark brows. And, somehow, the
late Mr. Read seems to have got into
the portrait that quality of courage
“You marrying old Karo for a Christmas spree? Why, he’s already got more
wives than he can remember.”
“I know; I’m one!”
which was undoubtedly hers —as you
shall presently hear. Captain Notting-
ham shows as a good-looking, manly
type of man, with close-cropped side-
whiskers coming down to the angle of
the jaw, and close-cropped fair hair, and
thoughtful eyes, and a black satin stock,
and. a dark coat with brass buttons, and
a flowered waistcoat. Which is about
all I can remember of him —for it is
many years since I was last at Stoney
Ranges.
AT the time of this present chronicle,
the year 1826, some ten years after
the marriage of Captain Nottingham and
Mrs. Moisey, the second summer of their
occupancy of the Stoney Ranges cattle
station, Captain Nottingham was a well-
preserved man of 50 and Mrs. Notting-
ham a still beautiful woman of 37 with
two children —a boy of nine and a girl
of seven.
The Stoney Ranges are a long basaltic
outcrop somewhat to the northward and
eastward of Bathurst, and although the
country is still rough and wild it is, of
course, not nearly so wild as it was
nearly a century ago. The station was
on the very outskirts of civilisation then ;
now it is within an easy day’s run of
Sydney by motor-car. In ’26 it was a
country of infinite spaces, where no run-
holder reckoned his boundaries by other
limits than the wanderings of his cattle
defined. Then a few white men
were settled here and there in what
was virtually a wilderness, with convicts
to work for them and savage black men
infesting the bush and ranges on every
hand. For eighty years the old, square-
built, fortress-like homestead that Mrs.
Nottingham in her second widowhood
built in her fifty-first year—a decade
before the gold discoveries —has stood
on the ridge above Stoney Creek. In
’26 she and her husband lived in a slab
hut with a bark roof, the station-hands
dwelt in another of about the same size,
whilst a smaller one served as a store.
With a stockyard and a horseyard, a
rough log fence round four acres of
“cultivation” and an open shed or two —
that was all there was of the original
settlement at Stoney Ranges. An-
other and better sort of mansion suc-
ceeded the slab huts —one of those fine
old colonial cottages with a low-pitched
shingle roof and a deep verandah with
a little room no bigger than a ship’s
cabin at either end—but it was to the
rude little huts that Mrs. Moisey jour-
neyed in a bullock dray with her babies
in 1824, and it was in them that she spent
the first years of her motherhood and
reared her two children and looked after
the good man who was her real mate.
(Colonel Moisey, twenty-five years older
than she, had been more like a father
than a husband.) And that was the place
where she did the thing that this present
writing is most concerned with, a deed
which, put in the terse language the
London “Gazette” employs in describing
those which win the Victoria Cross,
would read much like one of those
briefly-described episodes of heroism.
ONE December evening in ’26, as the
sun went down behind the long spur
of the Stoney Ranges known as the Big
Hill that lies across the creek from the
homestead, there came up the slope to-
wards Captain and Mrs. Nottingham,
seated on adze-carved benches before
their three-roomed dwelling, a queer-
looking, furtive little man who limped
and had a Tower carbine slung across
his shoulders. He had red hair and a
squint, and his clothing was ragged and
dirty. When he saw him coming Cap-
tain Nottingham rose to his feet, and
Mrs. Nottingham called the children,
who were playing on the grass a little
way from where she sat, to come
to her. Captain Nottingham took a step
in the direction of the loaded musket that
leaned against the doorpost—it was
always well in those days to keep your
firearms handy. But before he reached
it his wife spoke to him in a quiet un-
dertone.
“ ’Tis all right, George—’tis only
Squinny Mick.”
“By Jove, so it is! 1 thought there
was something familiar about the fellow.
Wonder what he wants and where he’s
sprung from?”
The man approached, with his hat in
his hand, and bowed elaborately, twice,
to each of them. Mrs. Nottingham
smiled at him.
“Well, Micky,” she said, “have you
come to be nursed again, or are Mr.
Mclndoe’s men after you, or what is
it? And how’s the leg?”
“Sure, ma’am, Gobless ye, ’tis glad I
am to see ye lookin’ so well, and th’
childher, too. Me bes’ respec’s to ye,
Cap’n, y’r honor. Sure, th’ leg’s done
fine, ma’am, an’s near as good as iver.
’Twas th’ fine job entirely y’r leddyship
made of it. Gobless ye for y’r kindness
to me.”
“Are you still a bushranger, Micky?”
she asked him.
“Well, thin, ma’am, ’tis sorry I am
for to spake th’ worrud —but ’tis that
same I am still. But what’s a man for to
do? If I give mesilf up they’ll take an’
hang me —an’ I’ve no wish for to be
scragged. Cap’n, may I have a worrud
in y’r ear?”
“Why, certainly, Micky—what can I
do for you?” replied Captain Notting-
ham kindly, smiling through his big fair
beard.
“Mayn’t I hear, too, Micky?” asked
his wife. “You know the Captain and
I have no secrets. Surely you know
that! He’ll tell me afterwards, so you
may as well tell me now.”
THE little man looked at her and then
at the children in his cross-eyed
fashion and shook his head doubtfully,
but said nothing for a few moments.
Then he shrugged his shoulders, grunted
and made a gesture with the hand hold-
ing the battered cabbage-tree hat that
meant compliance with her wish.
“Sure, thin, ma’am, ye’ll have to know
it soon as late, so’t might as well be
soon. ’Tis th’ sorrowful bad news I’ve
to give to yez. Cruel bad. But ’tis well
ye shud have it —an’ there’s little time
to lose.”
“Out with it then, Micky,” she laughed.
“I’m sure it can’t be so very bad. Have
the blacks been spearing cattle again?”
“Worse’n that, y’r leddyship—worse’n
that. Oh —bad luck to th’ bloody blag-
gard—savin’ y’r prisince, ma’am.”
“Well, what is it, Micky? Let us have
it. I think we can stand it,” said Cap-
tain Nottingham.
“ ’Tis this way, sorr. Ye must know
I fell in wid Black Jones an’ his two
mates, Bristol Billy an’ Calaghan. I’d
no tucker, an’ they made me welcome,
so I sted wid ’em this fortnight past.
Up in th’ ranges beyant. Th’ night afore
last, when they t’ought I was aslape—l
heard Black Jones a-tellin’ thim two
other rapscallions how he must —axin’
y’r pardon, ma’am —have a woman wid
him. He sez he likes th’ look o’ y’r
leddyship’s self. So they’ve made up
for to come here to-night, knowin’ th’
most av y’r min was away wid th’ drays,
Cap’n—kill you, sorr, an’ th’ childher, an’
take her leddyship away for to be Black
Jones’s woman. Yis —th’ dirty dogs!”
Captain Nottingham swore a great
oath in his beard. Mrs. Nottingham
paled a little, but smiled and nodded at
the little Irish bushranger.
“Yes, how nice of Mr. Jones!” she
murmured. “Go on, Mickey.”
“That’s all, ma’am. They’re a-comin’
to-night. I pretinds to fall in wid th’
plan, an’ they sint me ahead to spy out
th’ place. So I come to let ye know, an’
for to offer ye me sarvices,” said the little
man simply.
“By heavens, O’Riordan, I’ll see you
get your pardon for this!” said Captain
Nottingham, grasping his hand and shak-
ing it fervently.
“God bless you, Micky?” said his wife,
with tears of gratitude in her brave eyes.
“You are a good man.”
She gathered her children close to her
and kissed them.
“We’ll be ready for them, George,”
she said quietly to her husband.
“Of course, we will, my dear ; we’ll
teach them a lesson. Micky, how can
I ever thank you for this?”
“Sure, Cap’n, you an’ her leddyship
done it six mont’s agone. Where’d I


bin now if ’twasn’t for th’ way ye tuk
me in whin I run away from th’ road-
gang wid a bullet in me leg, an’ nursed
me till I was well, an’ hid me from th’
throopers an’ all? Ye don’t owe me no
thanks at all, y’r honor. But f’r th’ love
o’ Mary, Cap’n, let’s make ready for
’em. What min have ye, sorr?”
“There’s not a man about the place,
O’Riordan. As you know, all my men,
except Tallis and Herbert, are away to
Sydney with the drays ; and I let them
go to Bathurst yesterday for three days’
holiday, and Sam, the cook, as well.
There is no one on the station except
ourselves.”
“Thin we’ll bate th’ warmints, y’r
honor!”
“Of course, we will,” smiled Mrs. Not-
tingham bravely. “We’ve plenty of arms,
George dear, and powder and shot.
Come, we must be ready for them.”
FROM one o’clock in the morning the
narrow valley had echoed with the
sounds of musket shots as the darkness
was stabbed with little spurts of flame.
Towards daylight that desperate ruffian
Black Jones, whose terrible deeds are
still a legend about .Bathurst Plains, had
tried to rush the hut with his two mates,
both of whom were shot dead by Captain
Nottingham ere a bullet passed through
his body and left him lying wounded
and unconscious on the floor of the
living-room. Then, in the dawn, Micky
O’Riordan had made a gallant sortie in
the hope of killing the savage fiend, who,
although he was single-handed now, had
no thought of abandoning his purpose.
But he had hardly run ten paces towards
the big log behind which Black Jones
crouched when he fell dead with a bullet
in his brain, and now he lay spread-
eagled on his face out before the hut.
Mrs. Nottingham and the children were
unhurt. She stood at one of the loop-
holes her husband had cut in the slabs
the night before, keeping up a fire upon
Black Jones that kept him to his shelter.
Her son loaded the muskets for her, and
she had set the little girl to bathing her
father’s head and holding a wet cloth
over his wound to try to staunch the
bleeding.
But she knew that unless she could
attend to him herself he might die. She
had only had time to tear his shirt open
and glance hastily at the wound ere she
set her little daughter to her task and
returned to the loophole. She knew that
the victory—and herself—must lie with
Black Jones unless she did something
very desperate.
So she did it.
“Jones!” she called clearly
through her loophole just as the
sun began to gild the green of the
ironbarks over the Big Hill.-
“Jones!”
“What is it, ye bitch?” was
roared back across the open
ground where lay the poor, faith-
ful Micky’s body.
“I want to give in,” she cried.
“They are all dead —except me.
I’m coming out.”
“Come on then, d n ye, ye
baggage. Come out wi’ ye now —
an’ no foolery.”
She picked up a small pistol of her hus-
band’s that she had kept ready loaded in
case the worst should happen and she
should fall into the ruffian’s hands and
slipped it into the bosom of her cotton
dress. Then she stood up, opened the
door and walked out into the open.
“Put your hands above your head,”
roared Black Jones.
She did so.
“Come over here, d n ye!”
She walked towards the log, pale but
resolute. Black Jones stood up and
leered at her.
“Come here an’ kiss me, you little
devil,” he cried. “Ye’ve cost a deal to
get—but by God ye’re worth it.”
She came to the log and stood but
four feet from the huge black-bearded
monster on the other side.
“May I put my arms down?” she
asked wearily.
“In coorse ye can, me dear,” gallantly
responded Black Jones, signing his own
death-warrant.
Her hands came down to the level of
her bosom. Then, in one swift movement
that he had not time to realise, the pistol
was snatched from her bosom, flashed
and banged and covered Black Jones with
a cloud of white smoke in the which he
sank down and died. Then she walked
back to the hut and saved her husband’s
life.
IN the old churchyard at Kelso, near
* Bathurst, you may find the tomb of
the pretty lady who flirted with and
chastened Mr. Calder, and likewise
flirted with Mr. Death when she chas-
tened Black Jones at Stoney Ranges.
(3) A Tale of the Tahitian Fish-men:-
AMAN WITHOUT FEAR.
BY LIONEL TRENN.
“He knew that if the shark broke loose
it would kill us both. He knew that
others must smell the blood and come
quickly. He knew there might be death
for us both.”
WHEN the men speared fish
in the lagoon, Tane
watched them from
under the purau tree in front of
my house. He sat with hands
clasped about his legs and
looked a veritable giant. The
huge brown back was as big and
round as a hogshead. Below the
arms muscles bulged like abnormal
tumors ; they swelled on each side of the
neck, forming a pyramidal-support for
the bent head. He gazed fixedly across
the still water at the spear-shafts and
black heads bobbing up and down, and
seemed a figure doomed to slavery
mourning the loss of freedom.
But at times, when someone speared
a fish, little exclamations of approval
animated his seeming lifelessness;
although barely above a murmur, they
betrayed an interest deep and hidden.
The natives of Tiaia were famed for
their dexterity in spearing, and boasted
that they could get fish the month round.
It was a pastime more than a task, and
I had heard of their skill before coming
to the village. But Tane, day after day,
with hardly a stir, remained under the
purau tree in front of my house, watch-
ing them, his massive shoulders rounded
and bowed as though burdened with
melancholy. I had not seen his face.
He came and went softly, treading with
bare feet, and sat with his left side half
inclined toward my verandah.
"Hello, Mary! Down for a sunbake?”
“No fear! That one bad for complex’n."
It may have been the fourth afternoon
that I became sensible of the feeling
his attitude conveyed: that the bent head
and motionless doubled-up body,
speckled golden with the slow-moving
sunlight that broke through the greenery
above, bespoke an inarticulate sadness.
And some time later, when he dropped
his right side and stretched out on the
white coral sand, it was abruptly and
with unmistakable dejectedness. He
slept, looking like some monster newly
washed ashore. The sun was lost behind
the low clouds faintly etched along the
horizon, and the fishermen were begin-
ning to swim for the shore when he
struggled to his feet.
I had risen also, and stood at the edge
of the verandah watching the changing
colors of the .vivid sunset. Tane wore
a loincloth of turkey-red and white. His
frame, silhouetted against the bright
western light, appeared immense ; it had
the stamp of that of a man of action,
and aroused my admiration. For some
minutes he gazed absently across the
lagoon, now a sheet of molten gold,
brushing the sand from his body with
one hand. When with a shrug of his
shoulders he moved away, I turned to
greet' him. He faced me, and the words
stuck in my throat. The right arm,
which hung limply at his side, was an
emaciated skin-covered skeleton.
A FEW afternoons later I joined Tane
- on the beach. His eyes followed in-
tently five or six natives with water-
goggles on their foreheads who waded
through the shallows carrying long iron-
pointed spears; behind each trailed
several yards of line and a small float
of wood.
“May you live!” 1 said in Tahitian.
“And you also!” he replied, glancing
round for a moment.
The silky lagoon, edged low with the
black coral barrier, shimmered in the
clear sunlight with the iridescent sheen
of nacre. When the fishermen, reach-
ing deep water, plunged toward the pass
opening on the sea, its surface rippled
in quick-changing colors. The deep blue
water beyond moved restlessly in the
long ocean swell and broke in waves of
foam upon the reef. The fishermen
swam without a splash, their submerged
faces scanning the coral bottom, the long
spears gripped between toes trailing be-
hind. Except for the ocean mumbling
at the reef, a slight rustling among the
cocoanut fronds overhead, and a low
lapping on the shore, everything was
still.
Presently one of the men reached
quickly for his spear and dived ; the float
at the end of the line around his waist
bobbed for a moment and disappeared
too. There was a gentle swirling at
the spot; then the water assumed its
former placidness. The man had for-
saken his natural elements to hunt food
in one that was hostile and unkind. Half
a minute later his dark head appeared,
followed by a sharp hissing of air and
a fish hanging from the spearhead.
“A fat torao ! ” my companion ex-
claimed softly, adding, while we watched
the spearman tie it to his float: “Ruarei
never misses!”
He faced me full as though to give
weight to his next words:
“A man without fear!”
There was gentleness in the brown
eyes set wide apart in the full round
face; and the snub nose, full lips, and
broad high forehead, sloping slightly,
evinced the best Polynesian blood.
“The sea is no place for cowards,” I
said, using an old Tahitian saying.
Tane nodded and repeated it quietly.
We smoked and followed the move-
ments of the fishermen in drowsy silence.
Ruarei was alone in the pass, diving
down the precipice of coral leading sea-
ward ; the others speared in the shal-
lower water on the lagoon side of the
reef. Suddenly he thrashed the surface
violently with his spear. I half rose ;
Tane straightened his shoulders and lifted
his head alertly.
“Shark! ” he ejaculated in a low voice.
An instant later a small, dark, tri-
angular fin broke water and disappeared
in a zigzag course toward the open sea.
There was a moment of suspense ; then
Ruarei dived again, and we sank back
into our former positions. Once more
the lagoon shone undisturbed and smil-
ing and a peacefulness hung over the
scene; only our memories of the brute
remained.
“He should have a canoe with him,”
I commented. “The smell of those dead
fish trailing in the water must attract
sharks.”
Tane’s huge shoulders moved impa-
tiently. “Too much trouble,” he said.
“It's shadow frightens the fish. Sharks
took mine only three times before this
happened,” he continued, nodding toward
the emaciated arm clasped round his
legs. “That was eighteen months ago,
just after the Pleiades rose.”
The biceps was missing and the fore-
arm and hand below the skin-covered
bone were shrivelled and wasted. Tane
observed the arm for some moments and
shook his shoulders in a gesture of de-
jection.
“Alas!” he exclaimed mournfully; “1
must sit and watch, and Ruarei spears
alone. There’s a cavern outside the pass
full of parrot fish that only he visits
now. Never again shall I hunt them.”
“Absolutely useless?” I asked.
Tan 6 nodded. “No stronger than a
baby’s. I tried spearing left-handed, but,
alas! it’s too weak to guide the spear.
Sometimes I swim with Ruarei and
watch him, but it is not the same as
before when we hunted together. I get
bored without a spear . . . Yet I like
visiting my old friends.”
HE half turned and faced me as he con-
tinued speaking. His eyes sparkled
with the animation brought on by mem-
ories.
“Some of the fish are old friends to
us,” he said. “There are the two maroa
that cruise in the pass. You should see
them. Easily eight feet long and as
round as bullocks. They were there in
my grandfather’s time ... no one can
catch them. They would swim over and
look at us. Many’s the day when
Ruarei and I saw them rolling in the
sand, we dived and gave them a prod
just for fun. Then there is the old
huehue. He is like a big fat sow and
lives in a hole near the entrance. Too
poisonous to eat, and he knows it. He
would always come out of his lair if he
saw us, as though he wanted to be played
with. When we struck him with our
wooden shafts and he faced round in sur-
prise not knowing whether to run, I
always wanted to laugh. He seemed
more like a dog than a fish. We would
annoy him for a while, then with a
sudden rush send him scuttling
into his hole.
“Why, even the big shark that
swims outside the pass knew us.
He must be over sixteen feet
long, and has been there since I
can remember. Now and again
he would swim over to take a
look at us, then dart away sud-
denly at some unwary fish going
in or coming out of the lagoon.
Ruarei once said we ought to
scrape off the barnacles that were
beginning to grow on his back
to show him we were friendly.”
Tane laughed to himself and
paused to roll tobacco in a pan-
danus leaf. I scanned the smooth water,
so deceptive and innocent of the region
unexplored beneath and the creatures
whose habits were unknown except to
Tane and a few. After inhaling, he
continued.
“The old sharks are well fed, and we
don’t worry about them. But the young
ones are sometimes dangerous. If an-
noyed they go mad and attack anything
in sight. One of them bit me. It was
after the Pleiades rose, just before the
full moon, on a day of many fish. That
morning Ruarei and I were the only
two spearing; the others had laid a net
across the roads among the coral on
this side of the pass. Neither of us
seemed to miss, and our floats were soon
heavy with fish. The whole time a barra-
cuda, which had been there about a
week, getting bolder every day, followed
us. He kept just out of spear-reach, and
when we stopped he would lie motion-
less, his long head pointed toward us,
mouth open so that we could see his
sharp dog-teeth. He was not bold enough
to attack us, but as we were leaving he
made a rush and snapped up a big roi
on Ruarei’s line. Ruarei cursed the bar-
racuda for a thief, and, giving me his
fish, said he was going to kill him.
“A canoe was at the net with two boys
gathering the fish caught by their gills.
I swam over, threw in ours and went
back a little way to dive for a totara I
had seen when passing. He was down a
couple of fathoms, and I sank quietly
to where his big, round eyes shone out
from a black hole in the coral. A
shadow passed swiftly across the white
bottom, and I glanced up and saw a
young shark swimming toward the


canoe. He disappeared without taking
any notice of me. The totara, shifting
about undecidedly, watched me creep up
and level my spear, and just before he
was about to dodge I got him. Imme-
diately his round body swelled like a
football; the long quills caught on the
rocks and held him tight. He couldn’t
get off my spear, so I decided to go up
for a breath of air. My head had no
sooner broken water than the boys in
the canoe shouted ‘Look out! Shark!’
“Instantly I ducked. Six fathoms away,
from toward the canoe, a young shark
of about five feet raced at me. It was
only afterwards I heard that the boys,
forgetting about me, had beaten him
away from the fish in the net with a
paddle. He had been struck on the snout
and was madly angry. I waved my
hands at him and shouted under water.
Immediately he turned sharply to one
side and zigzagged out of sight with his
tail wagging quickly.
“If I had known what had happened
I might have been more careful, but
thinking the shark was gone for good
I dived again. The totara was still
pinned to the bottom. His tightly-blown
bbdy with the quills rigid was jambed
firmly among the coral. After trying to
lever him out I sank my thumb and
forefinger into his eyes, braced my feet
against the bottom and dragged him out;
then I shot to the surface with him on
my spear. He was a good fat one ; must
have measured two feet' across blown
up. As I neared the canoe the boys
shouted ‘Shark!’ again. Not far away I
saw the, tip of his fin making a circle
around me, so without ducking beat the
water with my spear. He sped away, and
I swam to the canoe and dropped in the
totara.
“Ruarei was already returning. He
shouted to me and showed his spear with
the on the end. It is seldom
Ruarei misses. The boys started to speak
of the shark, but I laughed at their fears
and let go the gunwale for another
dive. I had barely commenced swim-
ming when they shouted: ‘Look out!
He’s on you! ’
“I was under water in an instant.
Not a fathom away he dived straight for
me, his eyes staring; the mouth, low
under his nose, opened slightly, lined
with teeth. I swung to one side and
raised my spear, but before I could strike
he took my arm in his mouth. The
blow knocked me off my balance, and
I am hazy as to what followed. The
boys say I let myself swing with him
and, turning half over, grabbed him
around the body; but all I remember is
the feel of his teeth through the muscle
of this arm and my left hand clutching
the soft flesh below his mouth.”
Tand paused in his story, held up his
good hand and looked at it admiringly.
It was an enormous spread of flesh,
fully ten inches across the palni, the
fingers as big as bananas. He thrust
the hand in front of me, opening and
closing it, and met my amused look
with a broad grin.
“A hand to be proud Of,” he said,
turning it back and forth. “It gripped
the belly of that shark so tightly that he
couldn’t do anything.”
For some minutes more Tane gazed
solemnly at his hand ; then, as though
remembering its other uses, he felt
around his side for tobacco, pandanus
leaf, and rolled a cigarette. Outwardly
he seemed as placid as the lagoon we
faced, but underneath stirred emotion as
deep and restless as the ocean beyond.
After a few deep breaths of smoke he
went on speaking.
“I was a lucky man that day,” he
said. “If I hadn’t thrown my arm
around the shark’s body and grabbed a
handful of his belly, he would have torn
me to pieces. Ruarei, too, probably...
Those young ones when roused go mad.
They lose all fear and attack everything
in sight . . . Did you know that the
flesh under a shark’s mouth is soft as a
sow’s belly? ... I had heard the old
men say that a grip there renders him
powerless, though I never believed them.
But their remarks flashed through my
mind the moment I felt the softness
under my hand. I dug my nails and
fingers into the flesh and clutched a
handful. The shark seemed to lose all
strength. He stopped swimming and
remained quivering in my arms. I
kicked my legs and came to the surface,
still holding him.
“It was about time. My lungs were
ready to burst. After I got my breath
I tried to move my arm, but it was
firm in his mouth. The water around
was bright crimson like hibiscus petals.
Ruarei was with me now. He grinned
when I told him that I held the
shark powerless and would swim ashore
with the brute. When I urged him to
get into the canoe before the blood
attracted others, he laughed at me.”
Tane looked up inquiringly. “Do you
know Ruarei?” he asked.
I shook my head.
“A man without fear,” Tane murmured
with deep convincingness. “Only a small
man, too ; no taller than yourself. Strong
though, and fearless. He knew that if
the shark broke loose it would kill us
both. He knew that others must smell
the blood and come quickly. He knew
there might be death for us both—and
he laughed!”
Tane wagged his head from side to
side like a man who doubts the accuracy
of his senses.
“The reef was twenty or thirty yards
away,” he went on. “Ruarei gripped the
shark around the body—it was shaking
in spasms—called the boys to follow and
pushed us towards the reef. I was bleed-
ing freely and getting weaker and
weaker. My strength seemed to be leak-
ing away like sand through an old sack.
I looked at Ruarei. He swam with his
head down, kicking his legs hard. He
met my gaze when he lifted his face
for air, and grinned, and spluttered
water to say there was only a little way
to go. He was the strong man now.
And when the boys shouted ‘Shark!’
and beat the water, Ruarei swam on as
though he hadn’t heard them. Over his
shoulder, I saw the fins of three zig-
zagging swiftly here and there. They
“Well, whaddo you know about that —
I forgot it was summer.”
were
too fright-
ened by the
splashing to at-
tack. Ruarei saw
me looking, and
grinned.
“Bef o r e we
reached the shal-
lows my manhood
seemed to ebb away.
I could only lean on
the shark and grip his
belly. What little strength
I had left I put into that
grip. At last we grounded in
a couple of feet of water. Rua-
rei sprang back to the canoe for
one of the fish floats, and broke
a piece off on the coral about six •
inches long. My head was swimming
round and round from faintness, and
the shark was wriggling with renewed
vigor.
“Ruarei returned quickly, put a knee
under the shark’s body, near my hand,
and forced the end of the stick between
its teeth. The jaw opened a couple of
inches and my arm fell from its mouth,
the muscle missing and the bone red
and bare. I shuddered and closed my
eyes for a moment. But when Ruarei
shouted ‘Courage!’ it gave me new
strength.”
TANE faced me, his eyes glistening
with emotion, and laid a heavy hand
on my leg.
“Then Ruarei did something unbeliev-
able,” he went on with slow emphasis.
“I know because I watched him with
my own eyes. They were getting dim
and blurred, but I saw him ... Yes ; and
I can still see him ... My grip on the
shark was weakening. He was thrashing
his tail back and forth and snapping his
jaws. Any moment I expected him to
break away from us and take an arm
or a leg. Ruarei knew the danger we
were in and acted without hesitation.
He pushed the stick into the shark’s
mouth, levered the snapping jaws open
a few inches, then with a jerk threw
them wide and thrust his hand and
the stick upright inside.”
Tane breathed deeply and added in a
low murmur: “A brave man.”
The sun had sunk behind the fair-
weather clouds along the horizon, and
the lagoon, the cradle of Tane’s story,
changed color with the fading day.
Ruarei and his companions swam
quietly, barely ruffling the surface, to-
wards the shore. We sat silent and grave
under the increasing beauty of the sun-
set, each thinking of a different man
without fear.

BY ELEANOR DARK
"It’s feasiblel said.

"Well, what of it ?”
"Just the fact that he lost his
head.”
FROM where I live I can see, three
miles away by road, the green fair-
ways of the golf links and the red-
tiled roof of the clubhouse, half buried
in trees. And now, since this awful
affair of poor Macfarlane, I keep re-
membering how, one night when I was
out after snails in the garden, I glanced
up and saw that one little light winking
away over there in the darkness, and how
I thought: “A dashed lonely place, that,
for a man to live all by himself”
He was a dour sort of fellow —not
popular, but, like most of his country-
men, a fiend for work. Our fairways are
famed, and you wouldn’t find a dande-
lion on any one of the eighteen greens.
No one bore him any sort of grudge,
although there were plenty who disliked
him for his curt manner and surly voice.
Anyhow, he was murdered. They
found him —a couple of caddies out early
after balls —lying on his back in the
middle of the ninth green. The side
of his head had been smashed to bits
with some sharp weapon, and —here’s
where the touch of the gruesome comes
in—the heavy iron spike with the red
flag on the end of it had been driven
clean through his body, literally pinning
him to the earth.
By a freak of coincidence Morris Bray
was staying with me at the time it hap-
pened, and as he is rather a bright light
in the detective world the local police
sent down to say they would be glad
of his help. So I got out the car and
we drove off. Bray said he wanted to
take a doctor out with us, so we stopped
in front of Crane’s brass plate, and I
went in and rang the bell. Mrs. Crane
came to the door.
“Don’t say he’s wanted, Mr. Davis,”
she begged; “he’s been up half the night.”
I apologised, adding: “But I’d be glad
if he would come. There’s been a—
well, a tragedy out at the golf links.
That’s Morris Bray, the detective, in my
car. He wants a doctor.”
She looked startled, but said she
would rouse him, and hurried inside. He
came out presently, looking yellow and
bad-tempered.
. “What’s happened?”
“Macfarlane’s been murdered.”
“Murdered! ” He turned abruptly back
into the house, pausing to say over his
shoulder: “I’ll follow you in my car in
five minutes. I want to get straight back,
and I suppose you’ll be out there for a
while.”
We waited for him at the gates of the
links, and, true to his word, he was not
more than five minutes behind us. I
introduced him to Bray, and as we
walked he said: “I was out this way last
night, Mr. Bray. At Gantry’s farm —
you know it, Davis —a couple of miles
past the links. There’s a new little
Gantry. There was a light in the club-
house as I came past on my way home.”
Bray said sharply: “There was? What
time was that?”
“I left Gantry’s about twp-fifteen. You
know how the road curls round the
links. Well, as I was passing the gates
here I saw a light go on upstairs, and
then —it couldn’t have been more than
two minutes later —when I was coming
round the curve down there near the
ninth green, I saw it go out again.”
Bray just nodded, and we walked on
silently.
THE body was still lying there, a dark,
sprawled shape. The grass round it
looked black and sticky, and the flag
fluttered in the morning breeze with a
ghastly jauntiness.
Bray walked, stepping slowly and care-
fully, over to where the body lay, and
stood for a moment or two staring down
at it. He lifted the left wrist and turned
it so that the shattered watch was
visible.
“Of course,” Bray remarked, “the poor
devil would lift his arms to shield his
head”
The minute-hand was gone, but the
hour-hand stood a little more than half-
way between two and three. Macfarlane
was lying quite close to the hole, and we
saw, shuddering, that the cup was brim-
ming over darkly with his blood. Bray
turned to the doctor, who knelt and made
a brief examination.
“Well, I can’t tell you much more than
you can see for yourselves,” lie said at
last. “He’s been killed by repeated blows
on the head from some sharp instru-
ment. I should say, roughly, that he’s
not been dead more than three or four
hours.” He added, turning to Bray: “If
there’s nothing more I can do for you
I’ll get back.”
He nodded curtly and went off to his
car. He seemed so unlike his usual
genial self that I was puzzled, and the
sergeant of police, who had joined us,
commented: “Doctor doesn’t look too
good either, Mr. Davis.” Bray asked
him: “At what time was the body dis-
covered?”
“About five-thirty, Mr. Bray. These
kids came out early to get ahead of their
mates.”
“Ah, yes. It’s now six-fifteen exactly.
Have you found any clues, sergeant?”
“Well, sir, there’s bagpipes lying over
there in the bunker. Mr. Macfarlane
used to play the bagpipes.”
“I see. Are there footmarks in the
bunker?”
The sergeant is a golfer ; he coughed
apologetically.
“Hundreds of them, sir.”
Bray walked to the edge of the bunker
and stood there eyeing the bagpipes for
a moment or two. Then he strolled
about slowly all over and round the
green, pausing now and -then, stooping
sometimes, saying nothing. As he came
back to the body I saw his eyes narrow
suddenly, and he dropped to his knees
on the grass, beckoning us to join him.


There in the velvet-smooth turf was a
cut; it was about nine inches long and
fairly deep —an unmistakable spade-
mark —but the cut had been so clean and
the grass so carefully pressed together
over it that it might well have escaped
an eye less keen than Bray’s.
“A spade,” said the sergeant, and
slowly the eyes of all three of us turned
to that gashed and battered head.
“I think,” Bray said, getting up, “that
we’ll go along and have a look at the
clubhouse. You can have the body re-
moved now, sergeant.”
WE went off silently, but we were not
more than half-way to the clubhouse
when the sergeant overtook us and gin-
gerly, between finger and thumb, handed
something to my companion. Bray
showed it to me—a golf ball, stained and
sticky with blood.
“Where was this?”
“In the hole, Mr. Bray. When I pulled
the pin out of the body I stuck it back
in the hole —and I felt something there
at the bottom.”
“I’ll take it with. me. Are you coming,
sergeant?”
Bray put the ball, rolled in a handker-
chief, into his pocket, and we went on.
Bray said presently:
“There are three main motives for
murder—jealousy, greed, revenge. Had
anyone cause that you know of to bear
a grudge against Macfarlane?”
The sergeant echoed my “No,” but
added doubtfully: “It just came to me,
Mr. Bray, when I seen that spade-mark.
You know there’s been rumor of
buried treasure on these links —you’ve
heard the yarn, Mr. Davis, I expect?
And —well”
1 took my pipe from my mouth and
stared at him.
“Good Lord, yes. That crazy old
Simon, eh?”
“I never set any importance on it,
Mr. Bray —no one does about here. But
just seein’ the spade-mark”— —
Bray asked me: “Who is this Simon?”
“He’s an old aboriginal—lives in the
settlement down the valley. He’s quite
batty, Morris, but —well” I appealed
to the sergeant: “He always did say it
was buried under the ninth green,
didn’t he?”
“Was this common knowledge? Did
he tell everyone?”
“Lord, yes. He’s a perfect nuisance.
Any golfer’s apt to be buttonholed and
have the whole yarn poured into his ears.
He was the bane of Macfarlane’s life—
always beseeching for permission to dig
under the ninth green. I believe he even
had a go once, didn’t he, sergeant?”
“I remember Mr. Mac-
farlane saying he’d had
trouble. But he told me
he didn’t think he’d have
any more because he’d
made the old chap believe
the spirit of the man who
buried it was there guard-
ing it.”
“Who did bury it?”
“Oh, Lord only knows!
I don’t really suppose
there is any treasure. All
the same, the old chap’s
tale never varied. It was
some settler his father had
worked for, wasn’t it, ser-
geant?”
“Yes, that’s right, Mr.
Davis. A chap from out
in the Bathurst district.
He was on his way
through here making for
Sydney, and this abo. with
him —Simon’s father, you
see, sir, when he was
young. This man took ill
suddenly, if I remember
rightly, and he buried
something of value that he
had with him ; and then
it appears he collapsed
altogether, and just before
he died he told Simon’s
father all about it.”
I added:
“He was always very
careful to explain that the
treasure, whatever it was,
was buried hurriedly,
loose in the ground, not
in a box or chest. Alto-
gether, now I come to
think of it, the yarn was dashed circum-
stantial. I wonder why his father didn’t
go after it. Did you ever hear that
explained, sergeant?”
“Yes, I think it was that he died him-
self shortly afterwards ; but he passed
the story on to Simon, who was then a
child. And then the whole family trekked
off somewhere else and never came near
the neighborhood again till Simon was
a middle-aged man —and balmy at that.”
“Were the links here then?”
The sergeant scratched his head.
“No. They’ve only been down the last
—let’s see—ten or twelve years.”
“Some of the land, though, was
worked by a couple of Chinamen as a
market garden,” I reminded him. “Their
hut was where the ninth green is now.
That would account for his not being
able to dig then.”
We were climbing the steps from the
second fairway up to the clubhouse by
now, and Bray remarked: “Well, it’s
all very picturesque, Jack, but rather
vague. We’ll see what we can find in
here.”
WE crossed the path, the large, greyish
pebbles of the gravel crunching be-
neath our feet, and went across the
verandah and up the stairs to Macfar-
lane’s room.
• There was nothing suspicious that I
could see. The bed had been slept in,
the window was open, the blind up. A
bag of golf clubs was lying on the floor,
pyjamas were flung on the bed, there
were a few letters on a chair by the
window with a stone on them for paper-
weight. Bray prowled about.
The sergeant, standing with me in the
doorway, said reflectively: “It would be
a strange thing, Mr. Davis, if there
turned out to be some truth in that old
treasure yarn.”
Bray was standing at the window.
“There’s a good view of the ninth
green from here,” he observed; and
then added: “On the side where the pin
is the grass looks thicker, more estab-
lished, than on the other. Why is that,
Jack?”
I joined him, pointing with the stem
of my pipe.
“The greens committee decided it was
too flat —that little dip in the northern
side was made in August when the links
were closed for top-dressing.”
“Macfarlane’s job, I take it?”
“Yes.”
“Would there be many other men
working about at the time?”
“Well, not on that part of the links so
much. You remember I told you that
part had been Chinamen’s gardens at
one time. The soil there doesn’t need
so much feeding as up on the hill.
That’s where most of the top-dressing
is done.”
Bray nodded, and, taking the stone
from the letters on the chair beside him,
he began reading them. Presently he
shook his head with a sigh.
“Nothing in those.”
He tossed them down, replaced the
weight, and then, with his elbows on the
window-sill, he leaned his chin on his
“Oh, Gwen! Just look at his costume. It’s positively disgusting.”
hands and stared down at the ground
below for so long that I, for one, be-
came impatient.
“Don’t you think we ought to get
hold of this old chap? Personally I
don’t think for a moment that he did
it —he hasn’t the physique, for one
thing—but he might be able to give us
a clue.”
Morris turned back into the room.
He was smiling to himself.
“Certainly—by all means. Let us go
to this settlement.”
IT is a miserable place. The shanties
sprawl about indiscriminately across
a little valley which seems alive with
skinny half-caste children and meagre-
looking mongrels.
One of the children directed us to
Simon’s hut, but we found no one in it.
A crowd of women and children, awed
NURSE: “Good gracious! We've made a mistake. This is the tonsil case.”
and excited, no doubt, by the spectacle
of the sergeant’s uniform, clustered
round the door. We found nothing in
the hut, but outside, very sketchily
hidden in a clump of tea-tree bushes, we
discovered a spade.
The spade. It was dark with blood,
and beneath the iron where it was riveted
to the handle there was quite a little
bunch of hairs —greyish, like Macfar-
lane’s.
I felt, rather wildly, that it was all
too horribly easy. The unfortunate old
man’s attempt at concealment was so
childishly inept. Beneath my horror and
repugnance I felt regret, for Simon had
done odd jobs for me, as he had for
prettly nearly everyone in the town.
As we turned to go we found our-
selves confronted by a huge young half-
caste who demanded truculently: “What
yer doin’ in there?”
The sergeant replied: “We’re looking
for your father, Joe. Where is he?”
“What yer want him for?”
Bray answered, holding out the spade:
“To ask him what he knows about this.”
The young man peered at it uneasily.
“It’s Mr. Torode’s spade. The old
man’s workin’ up there to-
day. What about it, any-
’ow?”
“How do you know
whose spade it is?” Bray
demanded.
The young man burst
out angrily: “Gawd,
haven’t I used it a dozen
times when I been workin’
up there. It’s got a T
burnt in the back of the
handle, ain’t it?”
Bray turned it over. It'
had. He said, watching the
man keenly: “Mr. Macfar-
lane, the greenkeeper, was
murdered this morning on
the ninth green. Did you
ever hear a tale of buried
treasure”
The effect of these words
was startling. The young
man made a sort' of chok-
ing sound and seemed to
shrink to half his size. He
put up a hand and wiped
sweat from his forehead.
Bray asked again: “You
say your father is working
for Mr. Torode to-day?”
“I —I ain’t quite sure,
boss, but I’ll ask Ame.”
He beckoned to an ema-
ciated woman, who
slouched up and stared at
us from sullen black eyes.
Bray repeated his ques-
tion, and she answered shortly: “ ’E’s up
at Torode’s. ’E’s always there of a
Thursday.”
We went back to the car, taking the
spade with us.
“Who,” asked Bray, “is Torode?”
I replied gloomily, feeling thoroughly
nauseated with the whole business: “He’s
the Mayor.”
Bray said thoughtfully: “When we’ve
had some breakfast I’ll ask you to drive
me there and leave me. We’ll drop the
sergeant as we go past the police
station. I expect he’s ready for his eggs
and bacon, too.”
BREAKFAST on a sunny, rose-twined
verandah brought my strained nerves
back more nearly to normal; all the
same, I was glad to leave Bray at the
rather ostentatious wrought-iron gates
of our Mayor and drive home alone to
potter in my garden.
I saw little of Bray for the next few
days. He told me soberly that he was
making headway, but 1 did not want to
discuss it. I suppose I am unduly im-
pressionable.
However, on the evening of the third
day Bray came in and said quietly: “I’ve
got him—confession and all. Do you
want to hear about it?”
“Poor old brute! Yes, I suppose so.
Or was it the son?”
“Neither.”
I stared in amazement.
“Then who?”
Bray sat down in the chair opposite
and tapped me eagerly on the knee. This
was one of the moment's he lives for, and
I could not but curb my curiosity and
let him tell his tale in his own way. He
began:
“It’s the story of the buried treasure.
Old Simon, as you know, told everyone
of it. Only two people took him at all
seriously: Macfarlane and —a second
person. The links, you remember telling
me, were closed for repairs in August,
and it was a few months later that Mac-
farlane came round to the idea that there
might really be something in the yarn.
He was, of course, in an ideal position
to try, but he only half believed, and he
didn’t want to risk a good job for no-
thing. So he decided to wait until the
links were closed again, when he could
be pretty sure of not being disturbed,
and could put up a tale of re-forming the
green if its mutilated state should chance
to be noticed by anyone.
“In the meantime, however, he had to
keep old Simon from trying himself, as,
apparently, he did several times. Luck
was with Macfarlane, for the old chap’s
directions were to dig in the shadow of
the trunk of that huge tree —you know it
—on the night' of the full moon. This
made it child’s play for Macfarlane. All
he had to do was to keep watch from
his window on full-moon nigh?s”
“But, good Lord,” I interrupted,
“couldn’t Simon have taken measure-
ments and dug there any old time? And
wouldn’t the tree have altered somewhat
in—how many?—sixty years?”
“You must remember you’re dealing
with a half-wit, Jack. He kept on lament-
ing to Macfarlane that there was only
one night in every month that was any
good, so that Macfarlane was reasonably
certain that no measurements had been
taken up to that time, at any rate. By
watching from his window he could be
sure, too, that from then on none would
be taken.”
“And so whenever he saw the old bird
there he went down and slung him out,
eh?”
“No. Macfarlane had the Scotsman’s
dry sense of humor. He knew the super-
stition of the aborigine, and he evolved
a less exhausting method. He told the
old chap that when white men buried
treasure their spirits always stayed by to
guard it, and he pretended that was why
he dared not try himself. All this I got
from questioning Simon when I talked
to him up at Mr. Torode’s. Well, then—
you remember the bagpipes?”
(Continued on next page.)


“Yes. They took the part of the de-
parted settler’s spirit—was that it?”
“That was it. When Macfarlane saw
Simon from his window he just manu-
factured a few bloodcurdling wails, and
the old fellow got for his life with the
white man’s spirit in hot pursuit.”
Bray paused to light his pipe.
I said impatiently: “Well? Go on.”
*<MOW the second person comes on the
scene. He is anything but a half-
wit. Like Macfarlane, he was not en-
tirely convinced of the existence of a
treasure, and he realised (as Macfarlane
did, too, no doubt) that the directions
for finding it were vague and sketchy to
a degree ; that they could only be re-
garded as the merest approximation. And
yet he, too, thought it was worth a trial.
Wednesday night, you remember, was
dark and moonless. He took a spade and
a putter and six new red-dot Eagle
balls, for, if his work should keep
him later than he bargained for —why,
what more natural than that a keen
golfer should go out for an hour’s
practice putting”'
I half rose from my chair.
“A —a keen golfer?”
Bray went on: “He arrived at the
green, and paced out his measurements
to where the shadow of the tree
falls”
“But there was no moon”
“I was about to add: ‘on a moonlight
night.’ I said, too, that he was not a
half-wit. He had taken his measure-
ments. On the previous full-moon night'
he had rung up Macfarlane with a tale
of a tiepin he had lost while playing on
the links that afternoon. A diamond pin
• —valuable —wouldn’t lose it for anything
—was coming out to hunt for it. Mac-
farlane (who was looking forward to a
sleepless night anyhow) volunteered to
help. So, under the very eyes of the
groundsman, Number Two paced out his
measurements while his eyes seemed to
be industriously searching the ground.
The pin was found, too, where it had
been carefully placed that afternoon, on
the tenth tee.
“So it was easy enough for him on
Wednesday night. He took off his coat,
lifted the spade and drove it once into
the ground. At that moment there burst
out close behind him such a wail, such
an eerie, bloodcurdling screech, that his
hair stood on end, and he spun round
facing the bunker. He could hear no-
thing, see nothing. He gasped out some-
thing—he does not know himself what it
was —and then suddenly a torch glared
at him, and Macfarlane came out from
behind the bunker. The voice had been
so unmistakably not Simon’s voice. The
light fell straight on the man with the
spade—a big, bull-necked, powerful
chap, Jack, with a dark full-blooded face,
thickish lips, black moustache, hair
just a little bit too curly, eyeballs that
stared and glared with wild, primeval
terror”
I leapt to my feet, shouting
in a whisper:
“Torode!”
THE instinctive dislike 1 had
always felt for the man
grew and writhed in me during
the silence that followed. Bray
relit his pipe, well pleased with
his effect. But I was still strug-
gling with tangled skeins.
“Go on,” I urged him. “What
happened then?”
He eyed me speculatively.
“Had it never occurred to
any of you in this town that your worthy
Mayor had negro blood in him?”
“I never heard it hinted.”
“But now that it is suggested to you?”
I nodded slowly. I saw him mentally
as Bray had described him—heavily
built, dark, with the indefinable taint of
evil and uncleanness that so often goes
with the mixing of bloods which should
not be mixed. And I remembered other
things—the showy splendor of his house,
too full of mirrors and bright colors;
the flashiness of his clothes; the vanity
and ostentation which made it seem, for
instance, natural enough that he should
flaunt his diamond tiepin on the golf
links.
“It’s feasible,” I said.
“It’s true. I’ve made inquiries.”
“Well, what of it?”
“Just the fact that he lost his head.
He had had one bad scare already that
night, and away deep down in him —far
beyond his own control —his racial in-
stinct went mad "with terror at that
sudden ghastly wail from the darkness.
Fear and anger go hand in hand—and
Macfarlane frightened him twice, in his
two most vulnerable spots. For, as he
walked up to him, saw him standing
there shaking between fury and terror,
he laughed and said disagreeably: ‘Why,
if it isn’t the Mayor!’
“Torode has all the morbid sensitive-
ness of the nearly-white. His position,
his little bit of authority, his carefully-
bolstered dignity, have been his very life.
In a normal moment he would never
have acted so madly, but Macfarlane had
roused the black in him, and it was still
very near the surface.
“He said savagely, threateningly:
“ ‘You get out! And keep quiet about
this, see?’ And Macfarlane laughed at
him.”
“No, I ain’t got no time for the church. I ain’t. Firs’ time I went there they threw
water, over me, an’ the secon’ time they threw rice over me; an’ — er — er”-
“And probably the next time they’ll throw dirt over you.”
BRAY stopped, shrugged, threw out his
hands helplessly. There was no
need for him to go on. I had a picture
more vivid than I liked —that fury of
atavistic bloodlust, overwhelming, irre-
sistible, culminating in the terrible burst
“It looks like Diogenes looking for an honest man.”
“No blooming fear! It looks like Farmer Thompson looking for a divorce.”
of ferocity that drove the pin through
the victim’s prostrate, still - writhing
body.
I muttered: “Good God, Morris, how
horrible! And—and then? What did
he do then?”
“He began, like most murderers, to
make false steps almost at once. He
acted wildly, inconsistently. For in-
stance, he tried to conceal the spade-
mark, and yet, if he wanted to throw
the suspicion on Simon, as his action
in leaving the spade outside his hut
proves, it was to his interest that the
spade-mark should be found.
“Again, it was a clumsy thing— to take
the spade to the settlement. Simon, who
knows his garden and has access to his
tool-room, would have been at least
equally incriminated if he had simply
taken it home again and put it in its
usual place. Also, this futile detour
delayed his home-coming. It was four-
thirty by the time he crept in at his back
gate, and a milkman turning into the
street saw him and was struck by his
peculiar manner.
“Again, the golf balls. When he was
leaving the green he picked up his coat,
and the balls rolled out of the pocket.
He grabbed them up without pausing to
make sure they were all there. As you
know, one had rolled into the hole. I
found from inquiries about the shops
that he had bought half a dozen only
a few days ago, and when we searched
his house this morning we found five.
The man has no nerve, Jack —none what-
ever.”
“What made you suspect him at
first?”
“Nothing on earth but his own yellow
streak. When I went there to interview
the old man Torode was on edge. You
had only to look at him. Beside him
old Simon had a sort of tranquil aloof-
ness that was most impressive. I played
on the worthy Mayor’s nerves —I de-'
scribed the whole appearance of the body
in gruesome detail, and he sweated and
fidgeted and glared about like someone
trying to escape. And then, with an in-
spiration, I took the golf ball from my
pocket and held it out to him. I said:
‘We found this in the hole.’
“He grabbed it out of my hand. From
that moment I felt pretty sure, but of
course I didn’t let him see it. I had no
proofs whatever. I told him we would
arrest Simon on suspicion, and that
calmed him a bit—the swine!”
RAY puffed savagely at his pipe. I
asked:
“One thing I still don’t understand.
Macfarlane couldn’t have seen anyone
from his bedroom window —it was pitch
dark. How did he come to be there at
all?”
“Ah, that's where our friend the doctor
comes in. Macfarlane happened to be
restless that night. At about two-twenty-
five he decided to read for a while, and
he got up and switched on the light.
That was just as the doctor, coming
home from his case, was passing the
gates. You remember now, as the doctor
remarked, the road swings round near
the ninth green. Macfarlane had found
his magazine, was just turning back to
his bed, when the headlights of
the doctor’s car swept across the
green.
“For about two seconds the green was
illuminated as brightly as a night tennis
court. I got the doctor to take me there
last night and test it. A rabbit couldn’t
sit on it without being seen. You chaps
naturally don’t play there after dark —
you wouldn’t realise the way the light
would fall. Torode didn’t; that was the
other shock I spoke of —when he found
himself suddenly standing in a dazzling
path of light instead of the friendly dark-
ness”—
“Why didn’t the doctor see him
then?”.
“For the very simple reason that he
wasn’t looking in that direction. Didn’t
you hear him say that he saw the light
in Macfarlane’s window go out? He
was watching that. Macfarlane lost no
time. He saw the dark figure on the
green, and three seconds later his light
was out. Of course, he expected it to
be Simon when he took his bagpipes—
never dreamt it was not till he heard the
voice”
“And Torode didn’t see the light in
the window?”
“No. You must remember that it was
only on for about two minutes. He
had his back to it, pacing out his dis-
tance from the eastern side of the
green.”
“He told you all this himself?”
“He filled in the gaps. It’s precious
seldom, I can tell you, that I accuse a
man on such slender evidence as I had
against Torode—the golf ball, the spade,
the fact that he was seen at four-thirty.
But his own manner was his final accusa-
tion. I pieced the story together as well
as I could and charged him with it. He
crumpled up at once.”
Bray was silent, pondering. Then he
added, shaking his head: “It takes nerve
to be a murderer ; just that—unlimited
nerve.”
it AND the treasure?” I said after we
** had smoked in silence for a while.
“The mythical treasure. The legend of
it remains, I suppose, to breed more
trouble?”
Bray looked up at me with a little
laugh.
“Mythical, my dear chap! Who said
it was mythical? Macfarlane re-formed
that green, remember, last' August.
Didn’t you see the nugget of platinum on
his papers? The minute I felt the weight
of it I dropped to what it was. And
outside, mixed up with the gravel on
the path, I counted at least six other
small ones he had thrown away. Poor
Macfarlane! He‘didn’t know it, but he
had the treasure all the time!”

(5) Masculine Psychology; Finely Presented:-
Revolt
BY Rance Palmes.
Passion suddenly broke over
Harvey like a dam bursting. He
hardly knew he had struck till
he felt the jar run up his arm to
the shoulder, heard the dull, bone-
less thump of McEvoy’s body as
it slid to the deck.
DARKNESS of the sea and the cloud-
hung night were brushed from
young Harvey’s eyes as The Gannet
rounded the first beacon. Lights made
a yellow blur in the sky above the town,
strung themselves in a glittering boomer-
ang along the waterfront; and immedi-
ately he visualised Leila standing behind
the marble counter of Tino’s soft-drink
bar, a slim urgency about her young
body, a smile on her carmined mouth.
Leila, watching the crowds moving
through the wash of primrose from the
cinema opposite, resting her elbows on
the shiny marble and tapping one foot
in time to the jazzing gramophone
behind.
A new rhythm always entered his
blood as the port’s lights swam toward
them. Response to the sea’s wild slap
and tumble, to the surf’s throaty growl
along the reef, faded and died in him ;
there was a livelier excitement in the
clatter of tongues along the main street,
the colored movie posters in front of
Tino’s bar, vibration of neon signs and
broken fragments of music. Leila was
free by eight and ready for some dance
or show. He itched to strip off his soiled
dungarees, to put the smell of engine
oil and fish offal behind him and plunge
into the bright bustle of the town’s life.
But, when they had tied up to the
small jetty in the mangrove backwaters
and the dealers were round them clamor-
ing for fish, McEvoy said with a casual
grin: ■ '
“You look after them this time, Len.
Sixpence a pound—knock ’em back if
they offer less. But get rid of
it all to-night.”
He disappeared below. A
little later Harvey found him in
the cockpit, shaved, dressed in
grey flannels, the smoke of a
cigarette curling across his face
as he brushed his salt-roughened
hair. Anger and disappointment
welled up in the boy.
“You’re going off?”
McEvoy smiled at his own
hawk-faced visage in the glass.
“That’s so. Doesn’t need the
two of us.”
“But it was my turn to get
away this time.”
“Was it? I didn’t know it
was a matter of taking turns.
Never mind: you can have the
morning off and I’ll see the ice
and stores put aboard.”
WHISKING his felt hat from a locker,
McEvoy made a natty dint in it with
the side of his palm. There was a quizzi-
cal self-mockery in his eyes as he exam-
ined his weathered face in the glass. Out
on the Reef, even when lounging among
the backwaters of the town, McEvoy had
a contemptuous disregard of what people
thought of him. With his feet bare, his
dungarees rolled half-way up his burnt
calves, his mop of hair sweeping over his
low forehead, he might have been any
tough-fibred half-caste who had man-
aged to get hold of a boat of his own.
But when he really was dressed, as now,
he looked smarter than any clerk or
shopkeeper in port, rakish, aggressive, a
man women would turn their heads to
glance back at in the street.
It was the gleam of bright devilry in
his face that nagged at young Harvey
as he went back on deck to chaffer with
the Greek dealers.
“He’s taking young Leila out. As soon
as his eye lights on a good-looking
girl He’s old enough to be her
father.”
Resentment put a growl into his voice
as he opened the ice-boxes and weighed
out the snapper and coral cod. Out
along the Reef, trailing for kingfish or
sheltering under the lee of an island
from the wind’s fury, he was happy as
a bay in McEvoy’s company, ready to
carry out any order of his at a run. For
three years they had been together now,
and McEvoy had given him a share in
the boat, taught him all he knew about
the sea. The way they stuck to one an-
other was a joke along the waterfront.
But there was this new thing coming be-
tween them.
“Where’s the boss off to so slick?” one
of the dealers grinned. “Running some
woman, is he?”
Harvey snapped his half-smoked cigar-
ette into the water.
“That’s his affair . . . And there’s
no boss on this boat. We’re in the racket
together, both on a level.”
Lorries clattering down the muddy
track to the little jetty, lanterns swinging
backwards and forwards in the darkness
of the tin sheds, agents from the hotels
coming aboard to get supplies for the
week-end. It was a spoilt and shattered
evening for Harvey, teased by thoughts
of Leila slipping over the glassy floor
of some dance-hall to the pressure of
McEvoy’s hand. There was the butter-
cup mist that hung over the town half
a mile away, the thin wail of ukuleles
“Hope you don't mind roughing it, Charles. You’ll just have to take pot-
luck, you know!”
from the huts of black fishermen among
the mangroves, scent of mud and
stephanotis that always lingered about
these backwaters in the ebb of the day’s
heat.
And Harvey, lying on the hatch watch-
ing the tangled geometry of lights and
stars, thought morosely:
“He’s come to think he can put it over
me . . . ‘You can have a share in the
boat, Len, but I’m the boss. Every-
thing I say goes.’ ”
It was time to pick a row with Mc-
Evoy, he felt, to show his own hand.
He was twenty, and too well known
along the waterfront to have to spend
long chasing a job. Besides, there was
always the sugar country behind.
BUT all such thoughts were blown out
of his mind by the south-easter’s
breath when they swept past the beacons
again and made for the Reef. In that
world of flapping canvas and moving
water his old romantic loyalty to McEvoy
welled up in him again. There was some-
thing in McEvoy that commanded loyalty
when he was on his own deck ; vitality
and a joy in the game of life poured out
of him. With his mop of black hair
tumbling into his dark, challenging eyes
and his lean throat exposed, he sniffed
at the salty air as if it was his sole
nourishment.
“Didn’t go up the town at all this
time, Len?”
“No. Evening’s the only time that’s
any good to me when we’re in port.”
“Never mind. We’ll both have a
bellyful of it when the monsoons come.”
Lolling on the hatch with the trailing-
poles out, they baited the kingfish hooks
and laid the traces ready, glancing up
to watch the silvery wash that curled
away from the forefoot in flowers of
foam. All winter they had been making
good money, pursuing the shoals of king-
fish that came up the Reef on the heels
of the south-easter, plugging home with
big catches, and only stopping long
enough in port to take aboard fresh ice,
fuel, stores. They were making a bank
against the lean time when the sea would
be taut silk under a sky of aluminium
and the migratory fish nearly all gone
from the heated water.
A good life as long as the trade winds
lasted. Young Harvey was grateful to
McEvoy for having brought him into it
and licked him into shape as a seaman.
Along the waterfront there was no better
man at handling a small boat than Mc-
Evoy, none with a finer knowledge of
navigation, for he had had his training
in sail, and held a master’s ticket when
some obscure disaster in the China Sea
made him take to this small venture of
his own. The other fishermen didn’t like
McEvoy, were reluctant to ship with
him.
“Cranky as a hooked eel, that feller.
Can’t forget he’s lost his ticket—wants to
get his own back on everyone. But his
bark’s like the cooing of a pigeon to
young Len.”
It was nothing of the kind. Harvey
knew well enough the cantankerous
streak in McEvoy, the devil that some-
times rode him. There were times when
he kept as much as possible out of his
way.
But he knew, too, what a mate Mc-
Evoy could be to anyone he accepted.
There were imagination, humor, sym-
pathy behind the darkness of that hawk-
like face. They had had good times
together in the last few years, wandering
with their fish-spears among the pools of
the outer reef, lying under the shelter of
little islands in the heavy gales, beating
the white fishermen and bulls home with
the first catch of kingfish. You had to
live long days with a man to know what
he was worth.
IT was only when they were in port,
tied up among the mangrove back-
waters within echo of tooting horns and
pavement-tapping feet, that revolt against
the older man’s dominance stirred in
him. There was, for instance, that
change in Leila’s attitude since he had
introduced her to his mate in the cool
cavern of Tino’s bar. In the careless
glance of her blue, wandering eyes, in
the powdered prettiness of her young-old
face, he now detected something patron-
ising. When she accepted his invitation
to go out to some dance or movie she
was only putting up with him because
McEvoy was busy on the boat. She pre-
ferred a man to a half-fledged boy.
Once, stung by the perfunctory way
she yielded her mouth to him under the
tattered palms of the esplanade, he said
roughly:
“What the devil’s come over you lately,
Leila? Thinking about McEvoy, is it?
1 No good setting your bonnet at him—he
was fixed years ago. Left a wife behind
him somewhere down south.”
In the dusk her laugh had a brittle
unconcern.
“Think you’re springing something on
me, Len? My troubles if he’s left half
a dozen.”
“Well, it’s your business,” he said, a
coldness stealing over him. “If you like
to give people a chance to sling mud
. . . trailing around with a married
man.”
But she smoothed him down. A
sudden droop of her slim shoulder, a
quick, impulsive squeeze of his brown
paw, and she could make him feel he
was getting hot about nothing, acting the
jealous boy.
He had a dream about her that sub-
merged his reason, his humor, his know-
ledge ol the world. Whether standing
behind the marble-and-nickel fittings of
Tino’s bar or sliding before him to the
rhythm of a two-step, she enchanted his
mind with an image of soft, desirable
girlhood. Even the drawling sophisti-
cation of her talk, the coquetry of her
crooked smile, pricked his senses and
set him making romantic plans for the
future. Dusk. A neat little cottage on
the esplanade looking out over the water.
A woman watching from among the
tangled greenery (soft music) for a cer-
tain boat to round the beacons, its main-
sail bellying forward like the puffed-out
breast-feathers of a gull.
But when he mixed with the other
fishermen who lounged around O’Mara’s
hotel on the waterfront when their boats
were in port he was met with friendly
gibes that had a barb in them:
“Still finding McEvoy a good cobber,
Len?”
“Never tries to put the boot into you,
does he?”
“Look out for that girl of yours. Lot
of Big, Bad Wolves about.”
He was glad when The Gannet left
the stale smell of wharves and back-
waters behind and put out to sea.
BUT it was the cyclone season that
brought weeks of idleness, hard to
bear. In one of the stagnant arms of
the estuary they lay anchored, while the
town swooned in a bath of vaporous heat,
and mosquitoes issued from uncovered
tanks and swamps to make a thin vibration
on the evening air. The sky
melted into a luminous haze,
the sea lost color. Waves of
grape-dark cloud swept down
from the north and burst in
floods of warm rain. Day after
day there was nothing to do
but sprawl on the blistered
decks, splash paint on the hull
and railings, aWait the slow re-
turn of the south-east trades.
McEvoy announced suddenly
one morning that he was going
for a trip to- the tableland. He
slung some things together in a
grip, and slipped off, promising
to be back in a week or so.
When Harvey went up the town
that evening, he found that Leila
had gone off on her holidays,
too.
“I wanta her stay while da business
good,” Tino said with a grin, “but no
fear! What anyone else want —that
don’t trouble young Leila. She flinga da
towel at my head when I talk an’ jus’
go.”
There was a chaos of hot darkness in
young Harvey’s mind as he made his
way back through deserted side streets to
the boat. Languid voices drifted from
behind rattan blinds, lights shone dimly
through tangles of dripping greenery,
lanterns bobbed about on backwaters
where colored boys were catching
prawns. But Harvey hardly heard or
saw anything. All his thoughts and feel-
ings were swirling round in that chaos
of hot darkness.
When he looked for company in the
days that' followed it was not among the
fishermen who hung around O’Mara’s
hotel. There were the colored people,
whose flimsy shanties were strung out
along the mangrove backwaters, with
doors always open to a white man who
had cut adrift. Hospitable folk, these
islanders and half-castes, and they had
always liked Harvey. Ukuleles tinkled in
the warm dusk; there was the carefree
laughter of girls, of young women,
drifting from one house to another;
dancing, an unceasing flow of smuggled
beer.
ROWING back to the boat late one
night, Harvey saw a pinpoint of light
in the dark, the vague outline of a body.
It was McEvoy lying on the hatch in his
pyjamas, a stub of half-burnt cigarette in
his fingers, one elbow propping up his
head.
{Continued on next page.)


“Well, how’re things?” came his easy
greeting. “Find it hard to put the time
in?”
Harvey did not reply. He stood dumb
and immobile, fingering the heavy row-
lock he had taken from the dinghy. For
awhile McEvoy stared at him, and then
sat up, snapping alight a match and peer-
ing with friendly malice through the
transient glow.
“You young prodigal, Len ; I believe
you’ve been getting pickled. Spoiling
your virgin liver with bad whisky, eh?
In this weather, too . . . What’s the
trouble? Not that girl in Tino’s, is it?
Forget her. She’ll never be any good
for a young fellow like you. Cheap
stuff.”
Passion suddenly broke over Harvey
like a dam bursting. He hardly knew
he had struck till he felt the jar run up
his arm to the shoulder, heard the dull,
boneless thump of McEvoy’s body as it
slid to the deck. Then he threw the
rowlock away from him and slipped
overboard into the dinghy, working it
towards the mangroves with one oar.
IT was with a vague sense of having blood
on his hands that he drifted down
to the sugar country and got a job with
one of the cutting gangs. But that did
not trouble him much. He had asserted
his manhood, liberated himself from a
dominance that was crushing him, tread-
ing him down. When he looked back
it seemed that from the beginning Mc-
Evoy had exercised a diabolical power
over him, playing on his youthful loyalty,
undermining his will, finally stealing
Leila away and destroying the image of
her he had carried in his mind. That
hawk-like face with its challenging eyes,
its mesmeric charm! He had smashed
its sway over him at a blow.
But as the days went on he
began to wonder if anything
much had happened after all.
A silence seemed to have
spread over the world; no
one came to arrest him ; no one
even made inquiries about
where he had worked last. He
was submerged in the sea of
jade-green cane, cutting, trash-
ing, turning out of his bunk be-
fore daylight to load the wait-
ing trucks. And when he
slouched back to the tin bar-
racks at night he was too bone-
tired to feel any sense of libera-
tion.
He dreamt instead of sun-
splashed . hours along the reef,
spanking over the crested water
with trailing-poles out and the
four lines streaming from the
bows. There was the thrill
that ran through him when a
kingfish struck, the more sober
joy of rocking by some reef
in the dark, with hooks down
for snapper or coral cod. And
what better mate could a man
have at such times than Mc-
Evoy? That devil-may-care
humor of his, that acceptance
of life as a game!
ONE Saturday afternoon he
was lounging about the
riverfront where the sugar boats loaded
when he noticed a dark-green cutter
tied up to one of the smaller wharves
lower down. For a while he stood still
and stared, his hands in his pockets, his
eyes abstracted. Could it be The Gan-
net? No, it couldn’t —not there! He
was surprised when a voice behind him
said casually:
“Yes, same old tub. Only she’s been
stripped and had a new coat of paint
slapped on her. I’ve been extending my
run.”
McEvoy was standing there, as if he
had risen out of the ground, a cigarette
in the corner of his mouth, the smoke
curling across his face. They looked one
another in the eyes: separate, independ-
ent, equal for the first time. Hardly
exchanging a word, they walked down to
the boat. Then on the edge of the water
McEvoy said with his slanting flicker of
the eyes, his challenging grin:
“She wasn’t worth troubling about,
Len. Cheap stuff.”
“All right,” said Harvey. “Let it rest.”
“Then what about coming back?
Fifty-fifty, from now on.”
Harvey hesitated awhile, savoring his
spiritual triumph, his newly-achieved
conquest of equality.
“That’ll do me,” he said at last.
“There’s only a few more weeks to run
here. I’ll be with you when we cut
out.”
(6) Comedy of a Little Man:—
MR MINTER
CALLS IT A DAY.
BY FRANK MIDDLEMISS
“Mr. Poulteney wants to see you, Mr.
Minter”... .With a feeling of numbness at
the knees Mr. Minter got down from his
5t001....He had never felt more urgent the
need for some medicinal support.
THE letter-box yielded nothing of a
nature to alter the color of Mr.
Minter’s outlook. His wireless fee,
he learned, had been received; for
butchering values Fred Price was still
unrivalled ; the next Orpheus Club meet-
ing would take place on 20th inst. Even
the last-mentioned reminder (and these
marks of his musicianship gratified Mr.
Minter as a rule) found him unrespon-
sive.
“Don’t forget your drops,” enjoined
Mrs. Minter. She leaned farther over
the verandah ; “and don’t fuss!” -
It was more than an admonition. It
was a pattern of cheerfulness and assur-
ance, a token of understanding and in-
dulgence, a prescription for the ferment
in Mr. Minter’s system, a talisman
against such frets and apprehensions as
should assail him during his day’s so-
journ from that portion of The Acacias
rented by the Minters from Miss Nott.
Mr. Minter waved his leatherette attache,
and proceeded to the tram stop at the
“Hey, what are you all coming out for? The shark only wants one of you!"
corner; into the pale September sun-
shine, into a wqrld more than ordi-
narily inimical and confused,
This was always his most enervated
mo ment: at' no period of the day was
life’s aspect quite so dubious, so con-
ducive to misgivings. Mr. Minter was
rather subject to misgivings. A fidgety
little man, one would have judged, ob-
serving him at the tram stop, but one
would not have guessed the depths of
his capacity for disquiet. An uxorious
little man, one might have said; rather
absurd in his connubial farewells. In
Mrs. Minter’s wavings one would have
perceived just wifely valedictions. Only
to Mr. Minter was there sensible that
quality in the ether, that effluence de-
signed to cast the devils from his soul.
It was pleasant to study Mrs. Minter
—a plumpish woman of Saxon fairness,
frank and benevolent of feature, surpris-
ingly unravaged by the charge that wed-
lock had imposed. With a certain
roguish humor. To see her now, em-
boldened by the cover of the butter-
boxes of geraniums, one would not have
suspected her of any disturbing pre-
occupation. To Mr. Minter, brooding
on the Thing she had confided, her very
gaiety was affecting. His heart melted
in the contemplation of her courage,
An intolerable nostalgia consumed. him.
Men have resigned themselves to the
gallows with more relish than Mr. Minter
to his journey into town.
At the best of times he approached
it with distaste. He found in this pinched
propinquity with his fellows much for
adverse notice. Even upon his con-
sciousness of the Thing there obtruded
certain claims to his displeasure—the
operations of his neighbor with the nail-
file, the sniffings of his neighbor with the
paper. “Catarrex Will Cure You,” read
Mr. Minter: “Thousands have rid them-
selves of this Disgusting and Dangerous
Affliction.” Filbert-shaped, wasn’t it,
they called them? Filbert . . . “Gave
Blood for Sister. Alfred Hiscock, a
fitter . . . Baby in Suitcase. Mother’s
Pathetic”
There was a sudden distressing func-
tioning of Mr. Minter’s pores, a sudden
shortage in his visual transmission. The
young man with the nail-file finished with
his cuticle and alighted, the mottled lady
cast off her knitting, but Mr. Minter
had no knowledge of these things. Darker
prospects engaged him: pictures that'
plucked at his vitals, deprived him of all
virtue. A rather anxious-looking little
man, one might have said, observing
him at this juncture, oddly owlish in his
tortoiseshell-rimmed pince-nez; but one
would not have suspected the measure
of Mr. Minter’s discomposure.
Only Mrs. Minter would have seen
in him a man beset by his familiars.
Already the talisman had failed.
. , , .
T was chiming the three-quarters as
he turned into the laneway leading
tc l Iteney and Poole s. Something
°u f® vens^ ness abated as he mounted
the ill-lit stairs. To this end had his
trussings been directed. A primary obli-
gation was discharged.
Of the clerical staff Mr. Minter was
usually first. He valued the moments
of privacy it gave him, the quieting com-
pamonship of inanimate things. A duff
pulsing, the sound of cardboard boxes
in the making, emphasised his sense of
isolation. This morning more than ever
was this detachment grateful. He had
.never felt less ready for the cool scru-
tiny of Miss Trundle, for Truscott’s
breezy humors.
Perhaps the thought of spring had
sped Miss Trundle’s footsteps, perhaps
the thought of the month-end state-
ments; he had scarcely put his street
coat on its hanger when he heard her
characteristic cough. Her greeting was
civil but reserved. It was not Miss
Trundle’s way to advertise her motives
and emotions, promiscuously to throw
open the temple of her being. Her cold,
learned Mr. Minter, showed signs of
breaking. Her nostrils, he noted, dis-
played a certain erubescence, not the
more becoming in conjunction with the
magenta of her hat. A casque-like affair,
this hat, characteristically unflattering:
an expression of that self-mockery so
uncomfortably habitual to Miss Trundle,
to judge from the manner of its disposal.
It was not her custom to dawdle on
arrival, to waste her employer’s time with
prinkings, powderings and chatter. There
had been a young person while Miss
Trundle had the trouble with her tonsils.
Mr. Minter had found her demanding
and distracting. He still recalled her
marshmallow pallor, her little honey-
colored freckles. A girl who knew her
semi-colons, in Truscott’s absurd phrase.
SUCH extravagances of diction were a
part of the exuberance of the man.
This morning he seemed in extra fettle.
“Springish, distinctly springish!” he
affirmed. “Sort of morning to set the
old metabolism jiggin’, perk up the old
corpuscles. Makes a man ready for
his carbohydrates—mustn’t forget the
carbohydrates, Miss Trundle. Very im-
portant factor in commercial life.”
One might have imagined that to a
person of Miss Trundle’s temper such
overtures would have seemed foolish,
even offensive, but there was a note of
indulgence in her tart rejoinder—a
warmer reaction, felt Mr. Minter, than
to his own most felicitous remarks. They
were a part' of the day’s background,
these skirmishings of Truscott and Miss
Trundle. He envied the fellow his gift
for verbal romping: he envied his easy
_____ attitude to life. On the art and
practice of living Mr. Minter
had found him disappointing.
He showed no taste for philo-
sophical discursion. His lunch-
time inclination was rather to
a meandering among the seed-
men’s and hardware dealers’
offerings, to the manlier recrea-
tions of the draymen’s entrance.
He had no peer at quoits.
His first ebullience had now
subsided. To the tune of some
precepts to Miss Trundle on the
subjects of love and fashion, he
had assumed a small and elderly
alpaca, adjusted his suspenders,
refilled his inkwell, and (with
much wheezing, much whistling
through his teeth, much sigh-
ing and well-welling) had at last
addressed himself to his ledger
—an elephantine figure, quaintly
juvenile as to the behind.
From the corner near the
letterpress came the buzz of d
blowfly, upon which presently
impinged that signalling to Miss
Trundle Mr. Poulteney’s arrival.
Mr. Minter redipped his pen.
The Thing, the points at issue
with his devils, were become in-
creasingly difficult to focus. In
the residential opposite, he ob-
served, a man was cleaning win-
dows. Two storeys higher a
lady emptied a teapot into an
aspidistra; and higher still, in the ulti-
mate remoteness, on the soot-stained
plaster cornucopia, the pigeons strutted.
A quiet' place.
“And that’s that!” announced Trus-
cott, reaching for the ruler. “One of
these days, when I pull off the five
thousand”
The way things were, opined Miss
Trundle, one was lucky 'to have a billet.
«]I/TR. POULTENEY wants to see you,
Mr. Minter, when he comes back
from the bank.”
In a suitable medium, it is said, a
single bacterium will quickly multiply
to a million, but it was nothing to the
speed with which Mr. Minter would be
seized by a misgiving. A summons at
any time upsetting, it became the more
portentous the longer its significance was
debated, the moment for compliance was
deferred. The way things were ... At
such a bidding had Driscoll gone to face
the fact of his dismissal: with no more
warning had the pimpled Prestwick
With a feeling of numbness at the
knees, Mr. Minter got down from his
stool, took his tumbler from its drawer.
It was as if he had no knees, no stomach.
“Still on the old drops?”
He was still on the drops, Mr. Minter
understood himself to say. He had never
felt more urgent the need for some medi-
cinal support.


They were a necessity he would have
avoided, these excursions to the top-
room tap. Of minor ordeals none was
so discomfiting as this braving of thirty
alert young females. So disturbing. The
raw smells of strawboard and glue, the
rudeness of their employment, seemed
to make their femininity more potent.
Even the registering of their time-cards
partook of amatory adventure. Ruth,
Honor, Claire ... It was Claire who had
the scar across her throat. Not the
Clare of the plucked brows, at whose
incentive the top room would restore its
flagging energies with song. Melancholy
numbers, of exile and lovers sundered: a
strangely affecting concord, against that
dull mechanic pulsing, it sometimes
seemed to Mr. Minter, to the close of a
winter afternoon. Like the languor of
a ’cello. Mr. Minter knew something
of singing—the thrill of perfect diapason,
of public acclamation of his art. Great
nights, those of the quarterly concerts of
the Orpheus—oases, founts of tranquil-
lity and strength. Great stuff:
set the wild echoes Hying,
And answer, echoes, answer! dying, dying,
dying.
To the back, a little to the left', one
would find him on these occasions.
Rather hidden by the basses —one would
not have suspected that Mr. Minter was
temporarily a giant. A trifle pale and
serious, one might possibly have decided,
but quite patently he who had waited
at the tram stop ; who now braced him-
self for the sirens in his path to the top-
room tap.
IT was a relief to fipd that they already
had a claimant to their notice. Such
indeed was their absorption that only
by the forewoman, the matronly Miss
Spicer, had his entrance been observed:
“We’ve got an apprentice, Mr. Minter.
You remember Barbara? Isn’t she
lovely?”
Mr. Minter adjusted his pince-nez.
He remembered Barbara, remembered
her leaving: he had always thought her
lovely, with an elfin quality which
eighteen months at Poulteney’s had some-
how not defiled. But it was Barbara’s
companion who was the inspiration of
this rapture, for the benefit of whose
garments there had been spread on Miss
Spicer’s table a sheet of clean brown
paper. A small cause, one might have
said, for such commotion.
“Barbara’s biby!” breathed the shrimp-
like Maud.
One totally unfamiliar with the sex
characters of babies could scarcely have
entertained doubts concerning May
Eileen. Boys had not this ingratiating
boldness ; here clearly in her rudiments
was a female, of some vivacity and
charm. Nay, already, in top-room judg-
ment, an object of considerable merit:
a marvel of intelligence, a feast for the
senses, a precious, a bully and a scamp.
A “one f’ the fellers” (a compliment this
to Mr. Minter and the ancient and glue-
soiled Mr. Nugent), a miracle with her
teething.
“Ever y’ see such a dribbler!” com-
plained May Eileen’s mother.
The authentic pseudo-stern-
ness of the parent! A miracle
indeed, it seemed to Mr. Minter;
a phenomenon preposterous and
moving. It was absurd even to
think of her as married.
“I’d no idea” he ven-
tured.
But May Eileen in salivation
was deemed especially enchant-
ing.
“Dribbler!” reproached Miss
Spicer.
“Ol’ dribble!” chided the
sloe-eyed Ruth.
Ridiculous to find menace in
these fond and domestic-
minded creatures, engrossed
now in the sources of May
Eileen’s wardrobe.
“I’d no idea” recom-
menced Mr. Minter.
“ ’Er as gave ’er the naps?”
“Me sister,” explained Bar-
bara. “ ’Er as gave ’er the
bootees.”
“Ol’ dribbler!" pursued Miss
Spicer.
Somewhat uncertainly, Mr.
Minter picked up his tumbler,
proceeded to his business at the
tap; provided Mr. Nugent with
a match. Watched him search
his person for a bumper,
acknowledged some specimens
of his humor. Rather like his
bumpers, Mr. Nugent’s jokes—
rather furtive, not too cleanly.
One particularly seemed to
afford him a satyr-like amuse-
ment —something about the fel-
lers at the garridge. Mr. Minter
missed its purport. It was not
only that he found these offer-
ings repugnant; he had had for the
moment more than sufficient food for
thought.
"I say, mind your language; ladies, you know!"
“I don’t care. Bother them, too!”
A certain fastidiousness in the matter
of entertainment marked the manner also
of May Eileen at her reception by the
office staff. Even to Mr. Minter, unversed
in infant beguilement, his colleague’s
efforts seemed laborious and inept. Much
more to the visitor’s liking were Miss
Trundle’s glasses. Immediate rapport was
established with Miss Trundle, who, so
far from resenting this clawing of her
visage, seemed rather to invite it. Not'
that she did not scold. She drew for this
purpose upon a nomenclature of her
own: May Eileen, it appeared, was also
a blossom and a baggage, a bubbler, a
smoodger and a puss. She revealed a sur-
prising acquaintance with babies and
their habits, touched with authority on
intimate aspects of their welfare. They
were one person’s business, she averred ;
and became of a sudden less didactic,
less loquacious.
“She’s a lovely baby, Barbara,” she
concluded, as she relinquished the blos-
som to the maternal hands.
A child’s hands, for all their matronly
adroitness, reflected Mr. Minter; and
with a preparatory cough, with the per-
tinacity of the nervous, commenced the
reframing of his first courteous obser-
vation :
“It was quite in the nature of news,
I was remarking, to hear that Barbara
was”
Most men, to Miss Trundle’s thinking,
were, in respect to certain faculties, so
dull as to be counted feeble-minded.
Perhaps it was her projection of this
thought that made Mr. Minter pause ;
perhaps the delayed assimilation of Mr.
Nugent’s reference to the “garridge,” per-
haps Barbara’s manner with her gloves.
“Personally,” pronounced Miss Trundle
briskly, reverting to the subject of May
Eileen’s wardrobe, “I prefer wincey—
either that or cashmere. The best place
to get it”
But Miss Trundle’s recommendation
as to drapers was destined to be de-
ferred. It was at this point that it' be-
came evident that something was happen-
ing to Mr. Truscott. His most earnest
efforts for May Eileen’s diversion had
not achieved quite this odd contortion of
his features—this fish-like vacuity, this
fixed and frozen stare. His normal pink-
ness was merging into purple. But for
Mr. Minter’s quickness he must • have
slumped face foremost to the floor.
THE floor had served for a time the
sufferer for a couch. There was a
flask of office brandy in Mr. Poulteney’s
desk, and Mr. Minter had not' been nig-
gardly in its use. He had divested the
patient of his collar, undone his waist-
coat and contrived for him a pillow,
and all these operations he had per-
iormed with coolness, efficiency and dis-
patch. Even with enjoyment. It was
as if some part of his mental mechanism
had been jarred out' of engagement—an
odd sensation, of unfamiliar liberty and
ease. May Eileen had not comported
herself with more composure. He had
forbidden the calling of Miss Spicer,
TRAGEDY IN FIVE ACTS.
the gross Nugent, nor had he conceded
that there was occasion for the presence
of Mr. Mercer from the stores. His
manner with Miss Trundle had been
kind but firm (Miss Trundle, whose calm-
ness with cuts and suchlike was prover-
bial). Just ten seconds it had taken him
to assert his moral ascendancy over Miss
Trundle. To the boy from Packet
Lunches, timely caller with office orders,
he had stated with crispness his require-
ments :
“Never mind about the pies. A taxi
—quickly! ”
He had regretted his brusque recall-
ing of the lad, his specifying of a yellow
—it had smacked of a parading of his
powers.
And now, in a splendor to which he
was unaccustomed, with an intoxicating
swiftness, he was escorting Mr. Truscott
to his home. Tram travelling had
always seemed to him a demeaning mode
of transit, but never so ludicrous as
from this mustard-colored chariot.
Swept on this tragic errand, through
suburb after suburb, he was aware of
a mounting feeling of aloofness, of the
pathos of human endeavor, of the pre-
cariousness of life. There seemed no
limit to his calm and mollifying vision:
none was outside the ambit of his toler-
ance—not his catarrhal neighbor of the
morning, not Miss Trundle, not the be-
nighted Nugent, not
“Hedward-street, was it y’ said, sir?”
It was the driver.
Mr. Minter consulted the address he
had extracted from the timebook. He
had ceased since Newtown his attempts
at conversation. At Ndwtown he had
tucked his charge’s tie into his waist-
coat. Some difficulty had attended the
construing of this requirement, but its
fulfilment had seemed to give Mr. Trus-
cott ease.
“Edward-sfreet,” confirmed Mr. Min-
ter. “The Nook.”
THE residence so labelled, on a plate-
glass lozenge, was scarcely Mr.
Minter’s notion of a nook; scarcely
what from its owner’s grandiloquence he
had imagined. In the stucco-cnm-fret-
work manner, the last apparently of the
litter, it's threshold still bore the marks
of its creation. The garden patch still
seemed to be sulking at its denuding,
averse from a more sophisticated bloom-
ing. A debilitated creeper recoiled at
the rubble-work medallions. Ringed by
motor-tyres against the sickly buffalo’s
encroachments, two woody pelargoniums
vied with a bird’s-nest fern.
The door was open. A moon-faced
child, doubtless the renowned Lester,
stopped crying as Mr. Minter rang the
bell. In Lester, too, he was aware of a
falling short of specifications, a feeling
extending to Lester’s mother. He had
pictured her somehow as younger, rather
lively. A sudden nervousness overcame
him regarding the couching of his tidings,
a sudden compunction in adding to the
burdens of this tired-looking little
woman.
“Mrs. Truscott?”
Her flash of apprehension
served for answer.
“I’m from the office. Rather
a surprise, I’m afraid, but no-
thing alarming. Mr. Truscott’s
a little seedy—bit of a nasty
turn.”
It was thanks to the driver’s
sinew that Mr. Truscott was en-
abled to hobble to the house,
but it was by virtue of Mr.
Minter’s coolness, his inventive-
ness and humor that the jour-
ney was so cheerfully accom-
plished. In hands less firm, less
sensitive to the emotional ten-
sion, Mr. Truscott might have
appeared a man ominously
stricken. It was for Mr. Minter
to invest him with the air of a
convalescent; of a gentleman
who had benefited from a half-
hour’s sunning, though still, to
be sure, not just himself. It
was the driver who lifted the
sick man to his bed and de-
parted presently for the doctor,
but it was Mr. Minter who con-
versed confidently of the liver,
the course and function of the
bile flow; who meanwhile de-
vised small services that some-
how kept Mrs. Truscott busy ;
who eased for her a little the
dreadful time of waiting; by
his volubility relieved her of the
dangerous tremulousness of
speech.
With the arrival of the doctor
commenced Mr. Minter’s de-
flation. A ginger-haired young
man, with a gift of abashing
silence, he brought with him a
new conversational tempo, a
strong atmosphere of ether, and a small
sausage-shaped bag, which he deposited

manifestly familiar with those forces
governing mortal tenure, to whom man-
kind’s infirmity was an open volume, for
whom the dark angel might not count
it derogatory to reconsider his arrange-
ments. It was he who destroyed Mr.
Minter’s illusion of omnipotence. His
manner was quite explicit—he, Dr.
Pocock, was God.
He noted without approval the hap-
penings prior to his advent, and, having
sifted from Mr. Minter’s statement any
fragments of significance, stripped him
of any negligible value, readdressed him-
self to the figure on the bed. It did not
avail Mr. Minter that there were facul-
ties besides medicine, branches of learn-
ing no less esoteric, grave and chasten-
ing truths to which he had been privy
while the young man was carving frogs;
that, but for the fondness and substance
of his parents, the young man might
have been selling corsets or insurance.
Projected on that cold silence, his
humblest observation seemed presump-
tious. It was a relief to escape to the
affable company of the chemist, to de-
bate with him awhile the subject of
water-bottles, the claims of the nude as
against those with leopard-skin jackets.
Dr. Pocock was at the gate on his re-
turn. He would call in the morning, he
was saying. Mrs. Truscott could advise
him of any change.
MR. MINTER’S deflation deepened as
he waited for the train, retraced
(how tardily, how ingloriously!) his way
to town. Rethreading the strange
suburbs, there oppressed him a growing
feeling of the irregularity of the pro-
ceedings. It was to be hoped Miss
Trundle locked the stamp-drawer—it
would take him all his time
to be back by half-past five.
It was again indeed striking
the three-quarters as he
turned into the laneway, up
the familiar stairs. The
same and yet a different
Mr. Minter; with some
quality, however overlaid,
about him—some mark, however faint,
upon him.
Miss Trundle had locked the stamp-
drawer. She had put away the ledgers
and hung up Mr. Truscott’s alpaca, re-
duced to some sort of order the furni-
ture of his desk. His armory of pens,
his rubber stamps, the tobacco-tins in
which he kept his chromatic “stickers”
(calling for some niceness in their usage,
increasing in importunity from, the rose-
hued “Early Settlement Will Oblige” to
the passionate dark purple “No Further
Reminder Will Be Sent”). Already these
things had a wistful aspect, the elo-
quence of relics. She had repaired the
ravages of her cold with a rare covering
of powder—the wrong-colored powder —
not very expertly; and in this, too, with
that ameliorating vision, Mr. Minter
discovered a claim on his emotions.
“I thought I’d wait,” she explained in
answer to Mr. Minter’s glance toward
the clock.
“Kind of a seizure,” reported Mr.
Minter. “I’m afraid it will be a long time
before we see him back at the office.”
“A stroke?” suggested Miss Trundle.
Mr. Minter nodded.
“Sort of a stroke. They don’t tell you.”
“They never tell you,” agreed Miss
Trundle.
They dwelt on it awhile, the thought
of this conspiracy of silence. A small
parcel on the letterpress reminded Mr.
Minter that it was ten hours since he
had eaten.
“His pies,” remarked Miss Trundle
wanly.
And even in these Mr. Minter found
material for feeling.
“The old carbohydrates! Always
cheerful” . . .
“So witty!” faltered Miss Trundle.
It had never occurred to Mr. Minter
to apply to his colleague’s sallies the
adjective witty ; but it had never occurred
“Give us a light, Bill.”
to him that shafts so innocent (so incal-
culable is the vulnerability of females)
might pierce a lady’s heart, possess a
poignancy it now pained her to remem-
ber, though not' such sharpness as to
deter her in the rounding of her tribute.
“So j-jolly!” snuffled Miss Trundle.
“S-such a t-t-trick!”
MR. POULTENEY put down the
niblick he was examining.
“Got him home all right? Unfortu-
nate business, Minter —pretty sudden,
from what Miss Trundle tells me. How’s
he now?”
It was his favorite niblick, just back
from the repairer’s, and that he had
transferred so completely his attention
to Mr. Minter was proof of his concern.
He did not achieve in his solicitude quite
the effect of his late partner ; Mr. Poole
had had a sense of drama, a talent for
such occasions. He could give to the
terms of a dismissal the dark beauty of
a funeral oration: except in the case of
one Belcher (a rough fellow, a carter),
none had remained untouched by his
homilies on the depression. It was a
year now since he had succumbed to
his cirrhosis. His passing had come to
Mr. Poulteney with a shock. Such hap-
penings sobered one, brought home to
one the transience of existence. He had
devoted another afternoon to golf.
Mr. Minter reassembled his report.
“A stroke?” suggested Mr. Poulteney.
Mr. Minter nodded:
“Sort of a seizure.”
“Sounds like a stroke,” considered Mr.
Poulteney. “Nasty. Have to manage a
day or two until we can make some
arrangement.”
He thought they could manage, said
Mr. Minter. A great weariness pos-
sessed him; a great desire to put a
period to these doings, to retire to the
privacy of The Acacias—a sharp im-
patience to drain the cup of his disaster.
Presently he would learn ...
“Nasty,” repeated Mr. Poulteney.
“Must pop out and see him. No more
fishing.” It had been a subject of
mutual interest—fishing. There was
much of similarity in the outlook of
Truscott and his employer: they liked
jokes of the same genre. “Better fix up
with Miss Trundle about the taxi —
must have passed you on my way back
from the bank.”
Bank . . . Mr. Minter was ready for
his cue:
“I believe there was something about
which you wished to see me?”
“See you?”
Mr. Poulteney had picked up his
niblick. His air was already a little
vague.
“I understood this morning from Miss
Trundle that there was something”
Reluctantly, Mr. Poulteney returned
from the green places of his dreams.
“Don’t remember anything, Minter.
Can’t recall By jove, yes! Pianos.
You know something about pianos.
What d’you think of the Blichstein as a
job?”
Pianos !
For a man to whom it spelt release
from a carking apprehension, who
spoke on an empty stomach, after a
day of more than ordinary strain, Mr.
Minter expressed himself with a quite
remarkable readiness and sense. Pianos!
In terms more worthy of his subject, less
suggestive of the motor showroom, he
told what he knew about the Blich-
stein. An aristocrat of pianos, he con-
cluded, but costing anything up to a
couple of hundred pounds.
“Then seventy wouldn’t be out?”
The fact of the matter was, confided
Mr. Poulteney, he had struck a friend
that morning on the ferry who was sail-
ing next week for England. Some ur-
gency attached to the Blichstein’s dis-
posal. At such a figure, its owner had
represented to Mr. Poulteney, it was a
bargain, as any musician would tell him
—an absolute gift.
For a Blichstein in good order, agreed
Mr. Minter, it was certainly ridiculously
reasonable. Musician! It worked in
him like leaven, lifted him like wine.
The idea, pursued Mr. Poulteney, was
a birthday present for his daughter.
Twenty-one. Tinkled a bit —quite mad
on music.
A girl so constituted, conveyed Mr.
Minter, should find in such a gift a con-
stant' source of pleasure.
“Mad on it —rather go to a concert
than the pictures.” It was an idiosyn-
crasy in which Mr. Poulteney clearly
took a special pride. “Expensive things,
daughters,” he yawned, turning again to
his niblick. “Cheerful sight about the
house, but damned expensive, Minter.
No family, have you?”
Mr. Minter picked up his hat, that
lately squashed by Dr. Pocock. He had
suffered this Pocock without protest, he
had borne with patience since awaking
much that had wrought (at the time ob-
scurely) on his spirit'. So had Provi-
dence ordained it —it was a day.
“Well, no,” said Mr. Minter slowly,
and his friend the chemist could not
have dispensed his drugs more delicately
than Mr. Minter did his words. A small-
ish sort of man, one would have said,
but with an air about him.
“No,” he repeated. “We have no
family—as yet.”

The following are a few of the special
features responsible for the amazing per-
formance of the Stromberg-Carlson Dual-
Wave Receiver:
SELECTORLITE DIAL
This dial is divided into two distinct sec-
tions. The top part is used for tuning all
Australian (local and interstate) stations,
the call-sign of each station being shown
against its particular wave-length. The
lower portion is used when tuning on the
short-wave band. Short-wave and broad-
cast sections are lighted automatically and
independently, so that only that part
actually in use is illuminated.
Only one knob is used in tuning, and is
double-geared so that the dial can be
swung quickly or very slowly as required.
VISUAL TUNING
Tuning without guessing or experimenting.
Just turn to the wave-length required, and
when the visual tuning needle shows the
greatest swing you know you are on your
station. You then simply turn up the
volume to the strength you wish.
AUTOMATIC VOLUME CONTROL
Detects changes in volume from the
broadcasting station before they are
apparent to you and immediately read-
justs power so that the reproduced volume
is unchanged.
Visit your Stromberg-Carlson Dealer to-
day. Ask him to explain fully the features
briefly described above. Hear the faultless
reception of Local, Interstate and Foreign
programmes. There’s a surprise for you
when you do. Give yourself that surprise
to-day.

Comedy of Bumble on the Beach:—
MAKING WHORPLE (7)
SHARKPROOF
BY J B BLAIR
“Heard the news ?” asked Mr.
Pushpont. “Woman attacked by a
shark at Holdfast!”
Mr. Whiffle evinced some interest.
“Did it kill her?” he asked hope-
fully.
“No. Mauled her rather badly,
but she’ll recover.”
“Good,” replied Mr. Whiffle,
rather disappointed.
WHORPLE was not a fashionable
beach. The crowds which flocked
to rival bathing resorts a few
miles away, littering the sands with
lunch-wrappers, beer-bottles and empty
tins, and spending their money freely
at the local shops, somehow never came
to Whorple, although, as any resident
could have told you, its beach was easily
the best, the safest and cleanest in the
Southern Hemisphere.
Being essentially a modest community,
Whorple went no further than that, and
did not seek comparison with seaside re-
sorts north of the Equator, although it is
on record that the loyal Mr. Timkins, the
town’s pioneer chemist, while on a world
tour, sent home a postcard from Hono-
lulu with the inspiring message, “Wai-
kiki’s got nothing on Whorple.”
Whorple frankly envied its rivals their
popularity. Not that it wanted the
lunch-wrappers and empty bottles ; but
it considered that it was certainly entitled
to its share of the spending silver from
which they were inseparable.
Public-spirited townsfolk did their
utmost to attract some of the many
thousand holiday trippers to their own
strip of beach. An extensive advertising
campaign drew a small trickle
of visitors, but few came a
second time. The ’bus service
which, the council subsidised to
connect with Holdfast proved
very useful to those unpatriotic
young Whorpletonians who
wished to swim at Holdfast.
The life-saving competitions
attracted a fair attendance, but
the prizes, generously donated
by the shopping fraternity,
were all carried off by visiting
competitors. This was rather
a blow, as the donors had
hoped that the local club would
win them so that they could be
displayed in the shop windows
after as well as before the event.
THE week-end after the com-
petitions saw Whorple back
in its accustomed state of lazy
ease.
Mr. Joseph Whiffle, who had
been persuaded by an enthusi-
astic progress committee that
all the town needed to make it
the most popular watering-place
in Australia was a modern resi-
dential hotel, stood outside the
Hotel Ozone, which was the
outcome of the committee’s
endeavors.
He was not looking pleased.
He had no reason to, for he was
not feeling pleased. Opened a
month previously, the Ozone
had so far failed to attract the
thousands of tired city folk for whose
especial benefit it had been designed.
Mr. Whiffle regarded the future with
grave misgivings—so much so that when
Mr. William Pushpont, who, besides being
the town’s well-known and esteemed
draper and men’s outfitter, was also for
the time being the worshipful Mayor,
hailed him with beaming countenance,
he merely grunted a perfunctory “Good
day” and continued his brooding.
“Heard the news?” asked Mr. Push-
pont. “Woman attacked by a shark at
Holdfast! ”
Mr. Whiffle evinced some interest.
“Did it kill her?” he asked hopefully.
“No. Mauled her rather badly, but
she’ll recover.”
“Good,” replied Mr. Whiffle, rather
disappointed.
“But don’t you see how important it
is to us ?” i
“What’s it got to do with us. It
didn’t happen here.”
“That’s just it. It’s never happened
here. Don’t you see the pull it gives us
over Holdfast? ‘Whorple Is Sharkfree.’
‘Come to Whorple and Bathe in Safety.’
That’ll fetch ’em.”
“Fetch who?”
“The crowds, of course.” Mr. Push-
pont was warming up to his subject.
He exuded enthusiasm and slogans.
“ ‘Whorple for Safety !' ‘The Children’s
Paradise!’ ‘Sharks ■ Don’t Come to
Whorple !’ ”
“No,” criticised Mr. Whiffle. “They’ve
got too much darned sense. Y’ don’t
think a shark’s going to waste its time
9
cruising round here looking for swim-
mers when it can go to Holdfast and
take its pick!”
The slur aroused the Mayor’s indigna-
tion.
“It’s not that at all. It’s just—well,
they just don’t come here, that’s all.
I’ve lived here forty years and I’ve never
seen a shark.”
Until that morning the Mayor of Hold-
fast could probably have made the same
boast; but that was beside the point.
The proprietor of the Hotel Ozone,
however, was not so easily silenced.
“If y’ get the crowds you’ll get the
sharks,” he stated gloomily. “Y’d better
build a fence to keep ’em out.”
He grinned sadly at his joke.
BISHOP: “They’re the children of the devil.”
CURATE: “He certainly can pick ’em."
Mr. Pushpont almost danced with ex-
citement.
“Joe,” he said, “you’re a genius!
We’ll do it. We’ll build a net. ‘Whorple
Is Sharkproof.’ ”
THE Mayor of Whorple was not one to
let the grass grow under his feet,
and his infectious enthusiasm soon spread
to the rest of the council. The plan
as he explained it was simple. A small
sharkproof net would be erected, and the
safety thus afforded would attract swarms
of people to Whorple. With the money
obtained from the influx of visitors, the
net could be enlarged and more people
attracted, and so on.
Listening to Mr. Pushpont one visu-
alised the ultimate object of the scheme
as a huge net encircling the whole of
Australia, with the majority of the Aus-
tralian population disporting on the
beach of a Greater Whorple.
The council engineer’s estimate of the
probable cost dampened the enthusiasm
somewhat, and for a while it seemed that
Mr. Pushpont’s proposal was to come
to nothing ; but Alderman Bates, reveal-
ing unexpected initiative, made a bril-
liant suggestion.
“Y’ don’t want anything elaborate,”
he said. “That can come later. To start
with you want the fence for use, not
ornament. People won’t care whether it’s
handsome or not as long as it’s safe—
’specially if there’s any more shark
attacks at Holdfast,” he added hopefully.
He then outlined his scheme, which
was to use strong Cyclone fencing, sus-
pended from floating oil-drums anchored
to the sea bottom.
Some of the councillors were doubtful,
out the Mayor, ever ready to give credit
for a clever proposition, was immediately
converted.
“A great plan,” he applauded. “Just
like the veil they had round London
during the war to stop air raids.”
No one saw much similarity between
the two projects, but, as the engineer
considered the scheme practicable and
his estimate placed the cost at quite a
low figure, they were all eventually won
over.
WJHORPLE took up the scheme with
TT enthusiasm. Mr. Alfred Partridge,
builder and contractor, departing from
his usual practice of giving nothing away
except estimates, offered to perform the
job at cost price. Councillor Bates
undertook to get 10 p.c. off the price of
the fencing through a friend in the city.
He did not think it necessary to add
that this was to come out of the 20 p.c.
rake-off he expected to get on the order.
Mr. Pushpont discovered that quite
a lot could be saved by using second-
hand tar-drums that had been used for
road repairs.
Everything was running smoothly.
The council engineer, after conferring
with Mr. Partridge, announced that the
structure would be completed within a
fortnight.
Whorple looked forward to the day.
An intense publicity campaign was car-
ried out. City papers gave reasonable
space to the project, and one even seized
on it as a subject for a sub-leader; deal-
ing with the shark attack at Holdfast,
and urging that safeguarding measures
be taken at all beaches.
“The projected net at Whorple,” it
said, “is a step in the right direction.
Whorple is only a small beach, but it is
giving a lead to the more popular re-
sorts.”
Mr. Pushpont was overjoyed with the
article, and ordered 50,000 reprints,
which were to be circulated far and wide,
headed by the slogan “Whorple Is
Sharkproof.”
Opening day was to be a gala affair.
Mr. Pushpont saw himself delivering
a speech to the assembled thousands —
a happy yet telling speech, not too long,
yet with plenty of meat in it. Some-
thing to grasp and hold on to —yet re-
lieved here and there with flashes of
sparkling wit. A speech to be remem-
bered. He saw himself cutting the silken
cord, and thousands of carefree swim-
mers plunging into the friendly sanctuary
of the net, while outside sharks gnashed
their teeth in impotent fury. Oddly
enough, the only man in the town who
was not enthusiastic over the project
was the man who was really responsible
for the idea. Mr. Whiffle was frankly
pessimistic.
“Lot o’ rot,” he complained to an in-
quirer in the saloon bar of the Hotel
Ozone. “It’s all very well to call it a
sharkproof net, but how do we know it’s
sharkproof? And how do we know the
sharks know it’s sharkproof?”
THE great day arrived. The town was
* en fete. In every shop window
large notices proudly proclaimed the
sharkproofness of Whorple.
Flags were everywhere.
It was a happy thought on the part
of Commander Felspar, R.N. (retired),
to borrow signal flags from the naval
depot and to superintend the arranging
of them. A very happy thought, be-
cause if any seaman had chanced to
walk down Pier-street that day he would
have been able to read in international
code, “Whorple Is Sharkproof.” Even
for those who could not read the message
the flags presented a bright and colorful
show.
The net itself did not look quite as
imposing as it had on completion the
previous afternoon. A heavy blow in
the night had given it a severe buffeting,
and some of the tar-drums looked as if
they would rather have been back in the
corporation yard where they had spent
the previous six months.
The morning was not promising. The
sea was still rather boisterous, and light
rain was falling.
Nevertheless, the advertising had borne
some fruit.
“ Whorple Is Sharkproof !” shrieked the
2.10 special as it steamed into the station.
“Whorple Is Sharkproof!” roared the
’buses, which for once were filled with
inward passengers.
“Whorple is Sharkproof!” gloated
Commander Felspar’s flags.
A few minutes before three o’clock
Mr. Pushpont, his aldermen and coun-
cillors and other worthies of the town
mounted the temporary platform erected
on the beach and gazed proudly at the
assembled throng. The muster was not
as great as he had hoped, but,
still, it was the largest crowd
Whorple had known.
Boy Scouts and Girl Guides
formed a cordon on three sides
of the dais. On the fourth, the
seaward side, were ranged the
shivering lifesavers and mem-
bers of the swimming club.
Two long silk streamers at-
tached to the shoreward ends
of the net were held by the
Mayor’s two little daughters, in
Guide uniform, who now self-
consciously attempted to tie the
ends together. Commander Fel-
spar stepped forward to give
them the benefit of his nautical
experience.
At the conclusion of the
speechmaking Mr. Pushpont
was to cut this knot, whereupon
the lifesavers and swimmers
were to rush down and plunge
into the safe waters of the net,
followed by the general public
in its thousands.
The band, which had appro-
priately been rendering “Pomp
and Circumstance,” finished
with a flourish.
Mr. Pushpont raised his hand.
A hush fell upon the crowd.
Mr. Pushpont commenced to
speak.
“This day,” said Mr. Push-
pont, “marks the beginning of
a new epoch in the history of
Whorple. [Cheers.] Whorple
is leading the way towards safe swim-
ming. [Cheers.] Whorple can look all
other beaches in the face and say chal-
lengly, ‘We are sharkproof. Are you?’ ”
At this stage there should have been,
according to schedule, loud and pro-
longed applause. Mr. Pushpont paused
to give it an opportunity to break forth.
No applause came.
Instead, there were shouts of:
“Yes, it is! Where? Over that side.
I saw it! So did I. What? A shark!”
Loud shrieks and excited hubbub of
voices.
Mr. Pushpont endeavored to continue.
It was impossible. Half the people had
rushed to the brink of the water, and
were eagerly scanning the enclosure. Mr.
Pushpont stopped, and sought enlighten-
ment.
It came.
A black fin had been seen. Scores of
people had seen it. There was no doubt
about it. There was a shark inside the net.
WHORPLE’S Mayor rose to the occa-
sion. The ceremony was abandoned
for the moment. Within five minutes a
small dinghy was tossing up and down
inside the net with Councillor Bates at
the oars, while Commander Felspar was
prodding the depths with a long pole.
Rumors quickly circulated among the
crowd. Like magic there sprang up,
here, there and everywhere, persons who
had seen the shark during the morning.
“Fully twenty feet long it must have
been,” claimed one eyewitness who had
seen it frantically trying to force its way
out of the net.

MOTOR CAMPING ON THE CHRISTMAS
TOUR.
HOW EQUIPMENT SHOULD BE SELECTED AND CARRIED.
BY FRED BERRY.
JV/FOTOR-CAMPING tours, while the most enjoyable, are one
of the cheapest known forms of holiday-making, and it
is surprising that more motorists in this country do not organise
their Christmas vacation along those lines. In England and' on
the Continent motoring holidays are an institution, and during
festive seasons cars of every description are pressed into service,
carrying their loads of carefree people or towing a caravan as
whim or financial resources may dictate.
Expense cannot be the stumbling-block
ip Australia, for a party can enjoy a won-
derful vacation, not going without any-
thing in reason, for 10s. per head per
diem—cheaper than fares and boarding,
Furthermore, holiday-making without a
car has limitations. Though a few en-
joyable days may be passed lounging
around beaches or seeing various beauty
spots this rapidly begins to pall, and the

party, in order to relieve the monotony,
usually finishes up by spending more on
transport than was originally intended.
Avoiding Trouble.
A camping tour of any length con-
ducted by inexperienced people would
be, without some guidance, an adventure
wherein inconvenience and possibly hard-
ship would be encountered. The first
consideration is to decide the length of
time available and whether the party pro-
poses to sleep in hotels or camp out.
Where hotels are to be used one should
make reservations as far in advance as
possible, otherwise a pleasant run may
be spoiled in chasing round a strange
town after dark looking for meals and
bed. If freedom from schedules is de-
sired, the car should be so equipped that
the party can halt anywhere and camp
for the night or until such time as it
feels disposed to move. on.
In fitting out the car consideration
must be given to the number of travellers
and funds available, the choice lying be-
tween camping body, tent and fly, auto-
tent and caravan. Camping bodies have
of late been greatly improved, and any
car can now be converted without affect-
ing the use or appearance of the car for
everyday touring. When the camping
alterations are made the front seats fold
back, leaving the whole area inside avail-
able for sleeping, at one stroke eliminat-

ing necessity for packing and preventing
pilfering when the car is temporarily left
unattended.
Selecting the Tent.
Where the party consists of four or
five, a tent is necessary. Auto-tents of
various sizes and design can be either
bought or hired, and can be rigged in a
few minutes against the car, providing
really comfortable quarters. It will be
advisable to include a hatchet in the kit
in order to save delay when pitching
camp. *
With the day’s run ended, next business
will be to select a camp site and erect
the tent. There are organised camping
sites adjacent to popular resorts, laid out
and controlled by public bodies; and
should the tourist decide to remain at
one of these places he must take what-
ever position is allocated, the advantage
being that water supply and sanitation
are usually provided for. The genuine
motor camper, however, will select his
own site, and if he is wise he will first
inquire as to the ownership of the land
on which he proposes to pitch tent, and
secure permission. Never pitch a tent
directly under trees or on low ground,
for a sharp storm overnight can make
such a position decidedly uncomfortable.
Use the hatchet for cutting stout poles
upon which the tent can be erected on
a clean, grassy slope. In cases where
campers are forced to erect the tent in
a downpour, rig the fly first and complete
the job under its shelter. With this com-
plete, dig a trench about a foot wide and
deep round the outside for drainage, and
carry the soil inside to hold down the
sides of tent and keep out draughts.
Stout pegs driven firmly into the ground
at an angle of 45 degrees must be used
for securing guy ropes, and unless these
are of special non-shrinkable cord one of
the heroes of the party must go out and
slacken them off in the event of rain,
otherwise the whole outfit may come
down on the occupants.
Sleeping Arrangements.
While hammocks can be stowed almost
anywhere on the car without inconveni-
ence, few have acquired the knack of
sleeping in them. So unless the party is
prepared to knock up bunks from timber
available it would be wise to take light
collapsible beds made expressly for the
purpose. It may happen that one or
more of the tourists will be obliged to
sleep on the ground. Here the bushman’s
trick is worth remembering. Dig a hole
to accommodate the hip, spread the
major portion of bedding available under
the sleeper, and a comfortable night’s
rest is assured.
The next problem will be how to carry
the gear without inconvenience to mem-
bers of the party. Though the holiday
spirit may permit some latitude in this
regard there is nothing calculated to irri-
tate passengers to a greater extent than
odds and ends thrown promiscuously
around the car. For the first day or two

perhaps no complaint will be heard, but
on a long journey careless packing will
upset the harmony of what might have
been an otherwise pleasant' holiday. If

the party is large the best plan is to use
a trailer. These are now obtainable in
good and serviceable designs with the
swivel attachment or universal joint
anchoring the trailer to car of robust
dimensions, and drivers should not find
the slightest difference in handling the
car with trailer attachment.
, . Stowing the Gear.
Even without a trailer it is surprising
the amount of gear that can be stowed.
A collapsible luggage rack on the driver’s
side running-board will take care of
food and odds and ends without hinder-
ing passengers should they desire to leave
or enter the car. The rear luggage-carrier
should not be heavily loaded, as all
weight in this position constitutes over-
hang, and so causes the car to swerve
and skid on corners. Light and bulky
articles such as suitcases should be
strapped to the grid. With a closed car
a lot of gear can be carried on the roof.
Six stout buckles can be screwed along
the cantrail —above the guttering on the
closed top —three on either side ; and,
once having placed tent, beds and other
bulky articles in position, three leather
straps will hold the gear securely.
Don’t take a complete outfit of crock-
ery and utensils. Paper plates and cups
serve the purpose quite as well, are
much lighter and save the bother of
washing up. A moderate supply of
tinned foods should be taken as emer-
gency rations. Ordinarily necessities can
be bought as the tour progresses.
Camp Courtesies.
Equipment will not be complete with-
out a few bandages, lint, carron oil in
case of burns, iodine, permanganate
crystals and, to ensure a good night’s
rest where mosquitoes are bad, a small
bottle of citronella oil and lavender
water, half and half.
Finally, city- motorists travelling in
country districts during the holiday sea-
son should not forget when camping near
houses that country folk usually go to
bed early, and their repose should be
respected. Furthermore, it is a plain duty
to leave a camping site in the same con-
dition as that in which it was found.
Rubbish or litter should be collected and
burned or buried. Never in any circum-
stances start away unless the last embers
of the fire have been extinguished.
Motor Oddities.
“Synchro”: At Sandgate (Q.) a motor-
truck recently moved a large six-roomed
house. Accompanying picture shows the
house being drawn up a hill. The truck
was weighted down with hardwood logs.
and the dwelling, mounted on a trolley
with strong wooden wheels, was moved
several miles over all types of roads with-
out the slightest damage.
* * * *
“A.G.T.”: Got stalled in the middle
of a claypan. We had thought it was
negotiable, but were mistaken. It looked
a big job to get out; in fact, almost im-
possible to carry enough scrub to cordu-
roy 20 chains of lakebed. But we dis-
covered that the clay at the bottom of
the wheel tracks was very much drier
than the surface. We got a stick and dug
up the bottom of each track for a few
chains. The car was then put in reverse,
and out we came.
* * * *
“Shiggs”: When a mechanic set about
repairing a car engine recently, he found
inside the water-jacket of a cylinder
block a diamond. It was learned that
the diamond had been lost by the car-
owner two years previously. It must
have fallen through the filler opening
when the radiator was being topped up,
and eventually worked its way into the
cylinder block.
* • * * *
“Kripple”: Out on the plains, several
miles from Longreach (Q.), a rattle de-
veloped in the engine and the car
stopped. A tappet guide had broken in
several pieces. There was no spare
aboard nor material to make one, but
the shearing-expert-driver cut a piece
from a near-by hardwood fence-post, and
fashioned a guide from it. The make-
shift took us to our destination and back
to Longreach. It looked as if it would
do duty indefinitely.

A.L.O. (Maitland, N.S.W.). — Driving my
Master Chevrolet slowly around the city, petrol
consumption is 18 m.p.g., yet on a long day’s
run with speed average of 35 I get 20 or
better. Does not this upset the idea of high
speed adversely affecting fuel consumption ?
Stopping and starting, together with the
necessity for frequent rapid acceleration in
town driving, are responsible for the difference.
In top-gear, at a steady speed of 35 m.p.h.,
you approximate ideal conditions. Should you
attempt full throttle speed consumption may
easily rise to 10-12 m.p.g.
J.A.B. (Inverell, N.S.W.). — After having
driven almost 6000 miles in my 6 -cyl. car I
find it impossible to get the engine properly
warm under any conditions. It is fitted with
a thermostat in the cooling system. What is
the me of this fitting ?
The thermostat shuts off the radiator from
the cylinder block until a predetermined tem-
perature is reached, and so ensures a quicker
“warm up” from cold. Most American
engines are grossly overcooled. In your case
would advise dismantling the thermostat and
taking up the brass tension nut a full turn.
This will give a higher effective water tem-
perature.
M.M. (Rozclle, N.S.W.). — The clutch in my
Austin Seven slips when climbing hills. Is it
an expensive job to correct the trouble ?
Clutch is dry-type, and, as your car is old, oil
is now passing through back crankshaft bear-
ing on to the clutch face. A temporary repair
can be made by washing out the clutch
assembly with benzine, but the trouble will
soon reappear. The only sure cure is a crank-
shaft overhaul.
W.G.A. (Ballina, N.S.W.).—My 1926 car
now boils on long hills. Engine is in first-
class mechanical order, recently overhauled,
valves seating well and timing correct. Suspect
radiator or water passages in cylinder block
are rusted badly. How can I clean them ?
Do radiator and engine separately. Dis-
mantle radiator and swill out with a 5 to 1
mixture of benzine and carbon tetrachloride
after first draining out water. Next drain
water from cylinder block and replace with
weak mixture of muriatic acid and water. Run
the. motor for a few seconds from time to
time and leave in for several hours. Drain out
and flush several times with clean water before
connecting up with radiator.
Motor-cycling records will probably go
sky-high if the proposed speed test on
the Coorong claypans comes off. The
Coorong is a stretch of 100 miles half-
way between Melbourne and Adelaide,
and the actual road threads its way for
a third of this distance between two
shallow lakes with pipeclay bottoms. In
the summer these expose a stretch of
dry clay 50 yards wide with a surface
finer than any that has been obtained
artificially. The Coorong is as smooth as
glass without being slippery, and is a
motorists’ paradise— except the parts not
claypan, which suggest the other place.
The water on both sides looks like milk
owing to the white bottom.

“Weald”: There has been a marked
revival of stool ball in England. It is
a very old game, and its barrackers
claim it as the parent of cricket. Curi-
ously enough, it is almost entirely a
South of England game, and is chiefly
played by women, Sussex and Kent being
its strongholds. The pitch is shorter than
at cricket, and the wicket is a squaje
board on top of a four-foot pole. This
has to be touched at every run by the
batswoman, the “bat” being a replica of
that used in vigoro, which, no doubt, has
borrowed a bit from the old English
game. The bowling crease is in the
middle of the pitch, but otherwise the
rules much resemble those of cricket.
* * * *
“Waterline”: Some statistical fiend
overseas has been calculating the cost of
the challenge races for the America’s
Cup, the latest of which has ended in
the usual atmosphere of blanky. The
hideous mid-Victorian trophy cost only
£lOO in the beginning. In the 83 years
since the first race, 15 millions sterling
has been spent in defending it and at-
tempting to regain it. Taking Britain’s
share of that at five millions —a moderate
estimate, though she had only to build
one yacht at a time—each of her five
wins in the long series has cost seven
figures.

Kenny Kennedy, who left his native
Australia recently to take up work in
Lancashire, may help those English folk
who are apt to visualise Australia as a
sun-smitten desert to regard this coun-
try from a different angle. He is one of
the finest' ice-skaters yet seen here, and
is holder of the N.S.W. and Australian
amateur titles. He intends to compete in
England and, if all goes well, at the
Swiss carnivals, where more than one of
his countrymen have made a name for
themselves in winter sports.

Where Bribery Begins.
“Lex”: Sydney’s new league for the pre-
vention of bribery has supplied the press
with so-called “pertinent illustrations” of
what it objects to. For example:—
A company official had his house fur-
nished free of cost by a contractor.
What was this but a tip such as both
official and contractor (also 90 p.c. of
the league’s members) probably disburse
every time they have a meal in a favorite
restaurant? Tips are not given out of
charity; their object is to buy an ad-
vantage. If I don’t tip the waiter at

get the same service as habitual tippers
when next I eat there. On luxury liners
knowing travellers often tip the stewards
at the beginning of the trip, with a pro-
mise of more to come if results are satis-
factory. The tipper here has no more
moral right to preferential treatment than
the contractor in the case cited by the
Bribery Prevention League, but he will
get it.
A modern nation’s attitude towards
bribery depends largely on its attitude
towards tipping. The British are proud
of their reputation as honest brokers,
but they would be the last to deny that
bribery is rife among them. It carries
little or no moral taint, as the British
have been buying advantages over one
another by means of tips in hotels and
country houses, on trains, at fashionable
shooting-parties and so on for genera-
tions.
Italy, before the advent of Mussolini,
had anything but a fragrant commercial
reputation. The Government decided
that this was bad for trade. It began
its campaign in the places where bribery
had, so to speak, become respectabilised
—restaurants and hotels. As long ago
as the summer of 1928 1 tried to tip a
servant in the Hotel Moderno in Rome.
The offer was almost spurned. Restau-
rant waiters and taxi-drivers also refused
tips; not that they didn’t want the
money, but that they were afraid of the
consequences of taking it. The psycho-
logical effect on the Italians of making
these venial forms of bribery serious
offences has been to discourage every
form of bribery.
There is a lesson here for the oppo-
nents of bribery in Australia. Let them
begin by persuading hotels and restau-
rants to substitute a percentage charge
on bills for tips, as in parts of the Con-
tinent. State Governments could forbid
the acceptance of tips by railway officials
under penalty of dismissal. The system
is already followed successfully in the
barbers’ shops of several great Sydney
and Melbourne stores.

MEASURE AND TEST YOUR OWN
CONDENSERS.
BY DON B. KNOCK.
A simple and inexpensive capacity-bridge tester which may be made for a
few shillings, and which will prove useful as a ready means of checking
condensers or unknown capacities, is described here.
If you take interest in your home radio
workshop, you like to have around
various gadgets for testing this, that and
the other at short order. Signal gene-
rators, in their commercially manufac-
tured form, are, for instance, expensive
pieces of apparatus, but a fully service-
able and accurate signal generator can
be made up relatively inexpensively.
Such an instrument has already been
described (B. 12/9/’34). Similarly with
ohmmeters and analysers. One of the
most useful accessories for the radio-
D

constructor’s workshop is a means of
testing condensers. Although with reput-
able makes of condensers on the market,
the indicated capacity on the condenser
means what it says,'within a reasonable
margin of tolerance, frequently one gets
hold of unknown makes of earlier days,
probably rescued from an ancient re-
ceiver or picked up at the second-hand
store; and the markings have dis-
appeared. Then, again, some of the
small fixed condensers of earlier days,
although marked as being of a certain
capacity, may be astray from the mark.
Makers of condensers were not so fussy
about accuracy in those times.
A capacity bridge will soon tell you
just what is what about doubtful con-
densers, and, fortunately, it can be easily
made from parts that most constructors
are likely to have lying around. If you
haven’t got the parts, they are easily
obtainable.
Action of the Bridge.
It is not difficult to understand the
method of using the simple instrument
described here. Referring to Fig. 1, it
will be seen that if an alternating poten-
tial is applied across the points A and B
of the bridge circuit, in this instance by
the application of a buzzer, the current
takes two paths. One is through the
point C and the condensers in this side,
and the other is through D. By setting
the values of the four condensers a con-
dition can be obtained where the poten-
tial at C is equal to that at D.
Telephones are connected across these
points, and in this case no current will
flow through them, and no note will be
heard. This condition is secured when
the capacity AC has an equal ratio to
CB, as AD to DB. If the capacity at
AC is variable, any unknown capacity
connected at AD can be calculated if
AC is previously calibrated and the
unknown capacity is within the working
range. The value of DB controls the
range of measurement available at AC.
Constructional Details.
Fig. 2 shows the complete instrument.
It is assembled on a bakelite panel of
sufficient size to hold
the components, and
the variable condenser
of .0 01 mfd. is
mounted in the centre.
A few of these con-
densers can be bought
at second-hand stores,
relics of bygone days,
but if .001 mfd. can-
not be obtained a
two-gang .0005 can be
used with the stators
in parallel. Excellent
two - gang Ormonde
condensers can be
obtained from Mur-
doch’s, Ltd. (Sydney),
for ss; 6d. A three-
point single - pole
switch is required for
the range selection, this throwing three
condensers into circuit in turn, with
values of .001, .01 and .5 mfd. The con-
denser in CB is a T.C.C. .0003 mfd. mica.
The buzzer can be obtained almost any-
where, but it is not wanted as a buzzer
making a loud mechanical noise; the
electrical interruption only is desirable.
The ideal thing is a finely adjustable
“mosquito” type which gives out a high-
pitched singing that can hardly be de-
tected by the ear alone. Such buzzers
are not, however,
easily obtainable,
but a little inge-
nuity on the work-
bench can soon
produce one. A
light armature can
be made from an
old safety - razor
blade. If the blade
is heated to red-
ness and allowed
to cool slowly it
can be easily cut
with shears. The
buzzer in the tester
illustrated has only
one pole-piece and
a very small arma-
ture, and is home-
made. With the
tester panel
screwed to the
wooden box, the
buzzer cannot be
heard save through
the headphones.
Note that the con-
nections to A and
B are made across
the armature con-
tacts of the buzzer, and not merely in
series with the windings. Calibration and
operation are simplicity itself. The tester
must first be calibrated, and for this pur-
pose a few condensers known to be
accurate are needed. Start with values
between .0001 mfd. and .005 and con-
nect them to the test clips, with the
range switch at the .001 mfd. condenser.
Call this range 1. Switch on the buzzer,
and tune the variable condenser for
minimum signals ( i.e., the silent point)
with each condenser. Mark the point on
the dial. The second range is dealt with
similarly with condensers between .01

old clock hand fastened to the knob, and the scale is of paper

the three ranges is controlled by the right-hand knob.
mfd. and .2 mfd., and the third range
from .25 mfd. to 1 mfd. With three or four
condensers, practically the whole of each
range can be calibrated by making series
and parallel connections. A .0002 mfd.

THE BROADCASTING OF CULTURE.
A writer in another place in this jour-
nal, Mr. Frank Clune, has taken the
A.B.C. to task for attempting to erect
a “cultural edifice” without"laying the
foundations. Mr. Clune propounds the
argument that the basis of all culture is
literature, that the basis of literature is
poetry, and that the A.8.C., if it is to
endow the Australian nation with the
blessings of culture, must send to Eng-
land for celebrated writers to talk to us.
Among the names he suggests in this
connection are those of G. B. Shaw, Kip-
ling, Aldous Huxley and J. B. Priestley,
and he instances as evidence of Aus-
tralia’s “intellectual hunger” the fact that
there was a very good attendance at cer-
tain functions in honor of Poet Laureate
Masefield.
Mr. Clune offers constructive and
reasoned advice. So much of the criti-
cism directed at broadcasting authorities
is destructive and unreasonable that such
advice is worthy of consideration. So
let’s consider it.
The first thing that emerges from con-
templation is a desire to quarrel violently
with Mr. Clune’s definition of culture.
He rules music almost out of the ambit
because “its appeal is not to reason or
intellect or to any creative instinct, but
entirely emotional. Some of the most
illiterate of nations are most musical,
and musical people are often illiterate.”
There are several vulnerable points in
that proposition. Goethe’s reason and
intellect seem, by all accounts, to have
been considerably appealed to by the
music of his friend Beethoven ; Shak-
speare’s creative faculties were stirred by
it, quite evidently, on many occasions,
and the Bard went so far as to attribute
moral delinquency to the man who
hath “no music in his soul.” Could not
what Mr. Clune has said about music
be applied with equal force to graphic
art and to sculpture? And what should
we say of the cultural standard of a
nation that cultivated no art save litera-
ture? Wouldn’t that be a negation of
culture as cultured people understand it
—not Webster’s “enlightenment and dis-
cipline acquired by mental training,”
which is only part of the idea, but an
ability to appreciate the arts, sciences and
philosophies? Why, the standard recog-
nition of culture is the degree, not of
Doctor of Literature, but of Master of
Arts! Also, would Mr. Clune deny
mathematics a place among the elements
of culture because quite illiterate young-
sters sometimes exhibit amazing talents
of calculation?
But let that pass. Let it be admitted
that the root of all culture is to be found
in the printed word, and (what is very
much easier to agree to) that a know-
ledge of great literature, particularly
great poetry, is a fine thing for the gen-
eral mass of the people, despite George
Ade’s shrewd dictum that the only really
literary people are those who earn a
living at it. Well and good ; but how
are you going to use a radio set as a
popularising agency? You can have
Shakspeare readings and Keats readings
and even Swinburne readings (if Swin-
burne is admitted to be a poet by folk
who put music outside the pale), and
who will listen to them? The penny
reading went out of favor 20 years before
the magic-lantern. But Mr. Clune
doesn’t advocate readings. He wants
lions imported to talk to us. Trouble
about these literary lions is that only
one in a hundred can make even a neat
after-dinner speech, and only two in a
hundred can lecture. Most of us have
“sat under” literary lecturers, as they
say in kirk circles; I’ve heard a whole
raft of them, and the only two who
didn’t give me a yearning for the night air
outside were Mark Twain and a political
orator who was also a book-lover. The
fact that I have no pretentions to culture
doesn’t make the case for Mr. Clune’s
argument any the stronger.
Also, it may be news to Mr. Clune that
the A.B.C. and even the commercial
stations do devote a little attention to
literature and to literary personages. If
there were any hunger for more, more
would certainly be provided. Music con-
stitutes the backbone of broadcasting
programmes the world over because
music is what broadcasts best. Sir
Thomas Beecham says broadcasting will
eventually kill music as dead as a door-
nail. When that happens there’ll be a
better chance for broadcast literature,
but the good old-fashioned habit of sit-
ting down and reading a book will still
be the handiest method of assuaging the
“intellectual hunger” from which Mr.
Clune supposes Australians are suffering.
PLAIN CITIZEN.
Country Short-wave Explorations.
There have been several surprises
recently for short-wave listeners, and re-
ception has been very good, especially
at the week-end. Unexpectedly good
were PHI (25.51) and PCJ (19.71) on
the 21st. They were on the air at 10
p.m., both at great strength, broadcast-
ing a welcome to Parmentier on his re-
turn. The roar of the ’plane’s engines
was realistic. A pity PCJ does not come
on earlier every night; it was equal to
FYA at the best.
Another surprise was the appearance
of WBXK’s 19m. transmitter at night, and
at good strength after 11.30 p.m.
With five strong stations at once, all
very close together in the 19m. band,
some receivers will be severely tested
unless bandspread is used. The writer
uses a 3-plate midget, double-spaced, and
even so seven deg. cover the five stations.
A station not yet definitely identified
has been coming in well on Sundays and
Mondays after 6.30 a.m. in the 25m.
band. It is just above FYA (25.2),
probably W9XF, and is much stronger
than WBXK, who is on at the same time
on 25.25 m. Otherwise the 25m. band
shows little change in the early morn-
ing. The 8.8. C. is now using GSA
(49.58 m.) for the last transmission to
Canada. This is inaudible here.
On the 23rd, DJA (31.38 m.) announced
a special transmission for M.L. and Aus-
tralia at 11 p.m. The music was very
fine and very strong. The special session
for Australia on Sundays is still weak,
but DJB (19.73 m.) improves to fair
strength by 9 p.m., closing time. From
8.30 a lengthy news session in English
is given. The other transmission on
DJA was too weak to copy.
The 9 p.m. session on Sundays from
RNE (25m.) is improving considerably,
is fair copy and quite interesting. The
midnight session from the same station
is almost inaudible now.
The 8.8. C. transmissions for Australia
continue at good strength, and are aud-
ible for a longer period. Probably the
25m. GSD will be the better of the two
shortly.
The early-morning sessions on Sunday
from Americans are still weak, with
W2XAF best, but only fair.

NIGHTOWL.
Amateur Chatter.
Following on the unexpectedly good
results on the 10-metre band for the
week ending 25/11/’34, Sunday,
2/12/’34, showed up even better. Start-
ing at 8.45 a.m., S.M.T., the writer heard
VK7KV calling and made contact. Im-
mediately after this, ZLIBA was heard
calling VK2NO, and contact established,
but the Maorilander faded out rather
quickly and signal strength was only at
R 3, Q 3. The surprise came when ZLICD,
of Auckland, was heard both on CW
and telephony, R 7, Q 5. VKs. 2LZ and
2HZ opened up with him, but ZLICD
appeared to have receiving trouble, for
he identified 2LZ as “2LG” and 2HZ as
“2HT.” VK2NO called him several
times without success. The best contact
of the day at VK2NO was ZL3AJ at
Rangiora (M.L.), with whom uninter-
rupted communication was held over a
long period, with all the ease, but minus
the QRM, of the lower frequency bands.
ZL3AJ could also be heard working
ZLIFT, but the latter was not audible in
Sydney. ZL3AJ worked with most of
the Sydney stations. Other stations
worked by VK2NO were VK7NC and
VK2LZ, and stations heard were VK2SA,
VK2YC, VK3CW, VK3JJ, VK3OF;
also a station unidentified, but with a J
in the call. Speculation is rife as to
whether this was a Japanese. ZL3AJ
reported hearing VK3BQ. No Westra-
lians were heard in Sydney, although it is
known that VKs 6SA and 6MN were
on the air. Nothing was heard of the
Queenslanders, but in the evening of
3/12/’34 VK6SA, VK4BB, VK7NC and
VK7KV were heard and worked by
VK2LZ, VK2SA and VK2HZ as late as
8 p.m., S.M.T.
These increasingly good 10-metre con-
ditions point to the possibility of some
real DX in the offing, and the band is
worth searching carefully. As after mid-
night many U.S.A. districts can be heard
on 14mc. very strongly, it is just pos-
sible that the 10-metre band could bear
fruit in the direction of U.S.A. around
this time. Experiments with aerials,
doublets, vertical and horizontal, and
“zepps” of the same types, merely result
in confusion as to the best type for DX
on 10. Almost anything seems to work
equally well, and the best results were
obtained by VK2NO on this Sunday,
with a half-wave horizontal 7mc. twisted
feeder doublet', which, theoretically,
should only be workable on the fre-
quency for which it is designed!
On the 7mc.-band the static has eased
off somewhat, and DX conditions have
been more pleasant in the evenings. In
the early morning, from 3 or 4 a.m.,
Europeans are fairly easy to attract, par-
ticularly Englishmen. A long conversa-
tion was held with the father of Eng-
land’s radio amateurs, G. Marcuse, of
G2NM, who is still going strong. Mar-
cuse is a pioneer, and has many early
records to his credit. On the 7mc.-band
he is using lkw. and puts a strong signal
over to Australia.
On 14mc. conditions for Europe
appear to favor the Maorilanders, but
are not good for Australia. A few weak
G’s or PAO’s put' in an appearance
around 9 p.m., but disappear soon after.
Between midnight and 2 a.m., American
West Coast ’phones are just like locals,
but “raising” them is another matter.

Superhet v. Tuned R.F.
“Jyk,” a radio dealer of Sarina (N.Q.),
considers the tuned R.F. receiver isn’t
suitable for some districts. He writes:
“The Bulletin writer who says T.R.F.
is the only thing for the North is wrong.
The climatic conditions are undeniably
severe on radio, receivers. Only the best
will suffice, and a certain manufacturer
has proved it. I have installed quite a
few of his 1934 superhets in this district,
and not had a fault developed yet. The
1933 model produced by this manu-
facturer suffered under the humid
conditions, but the defect was counter-
acted by equipping receivers in districts
likely to be affected with specially im-
pregnated parts. The parts were sup-
plied and fitted free of cost to the owners,
and this enterprising concern even went
so far as to pay freight both ways on
any receiver returned to the factory in
Sydney for modification. Bias resistors
are troublesome in N.Q., and I am sigh-
ing with relief because some modern
receivers at least are reverting to the old
method of C batteries. Only the other
day I had to rewind four T.R.F. coils
because electrolysis had ruined the
windings.”
[“Jyk” only raises the point of im-
pregnation against moisture. If a super-
het can be fortified against humidity
there is no reason why a tuned R.F.
receiver should not be treated similarly.
The superhet versus tuned R.F. argument
is one affecting mainly signal-to-noise
background ratio. Selectivity can be
dealt with by proper coil design. As to
bias resistors, there should be no trouble
with specially designed resistors, which
can also be protected against moisture.

Did You Know?
That in earlier days of “wireless” ex-
perts considered all wave-lengths below
300 metres to be useless for practical
purposes, and that these assumedly use-
less waves were given to amateurs to
play with? That these same amateurs
confounded theories by effecting trans-
Atlantic communication on about 100
metres with less power than that used by
the smallest ship installation? That
when amateurs established a regular
service, this band was taken from them
and much shorter waves, supposedly use-
less, allotted to them? That but for the
practical work of pioneer amateurs, who
got on with the job without respect for
orthodox theories present Beam and
long-distance communications might not
yet have been heard of?

The Q. and A. Column.
/ wish to build the Class-B amplifier (B.
27/6/’34), but Ferranti AF5C’c and AFs’s are
the stumbling-block, being very expensive. (1)
Must the 2.5-volt circuit be on a separate
transformer ? (2) With the 83 rectifier, can
the filament be heated from a winding on the
H.T. transformer, or must this be separate ?
190.
You are confusing the Class-B and Class-A
amplifiers described in the same issue. Class-
B driver and output transformers are very
different in specifications to the Ferranti types
mentioned. K. Jones, Gladstqne-street, Bexley,
N.S.W., specialises in Class-B transformers for
the amplifier contemplated. His products are
reasonably priced and strongly recommended.
(1) and (2) Both the 2.5-volt and the 5-volt
windings should be on a separate transformer,
and the valves should be heated before the
plate voltage is applied.
/ am making up your regenerative reflex
all-wave superhet (B. 21/11/ ’34) for A.C.
operation, using 42 pentode as suggested.
Please look over enclosed circuit diagram and
advise if resistor connections and values are
correct. —191.
The circuit is quite correct with the excep-
tion of the bias resistor and by-pass in the
cathode of the 42. This resistor should be 400
ohms and the condenser at least a 10-mfd
electrolytic. Connect the positive end of this
condenser to the cathode. The arrangement of
series feed from the voltage divider is in order,
as this is for decoupling in the plate circuit
of the 687. 250 volts maximum is the cor-
rect plate voltage for the valves, but this will
be taken care of in the drop across the 60
henry filter choke and the voltage divider.
The method of volume control is satisfactory,
but the control in the cathode of the 687
can be used equally well.
I find tubular .5 mfd. by-pass condensers
unreliable in battery sets, being leaky, and .01
mfd. is the largest capacity in mica types.
(1) Will .01 mfd. be suitable for by-passing the
plate supply to R.F. stages ? (2) Is there any
loss in efficiency by using .01 instead of .5
mfd. as R.F. by-pass in plate and screen-grid
leads ? —lB9.
There are good makes of tubular conden-
sers on the market. It is a good plan to
test all tubular condensers against leakage be-
fore installing. As no brand is mentioned in
the letter, cannot comment on comparisons.
(1) Rather a small capacity, but, if the stage
is not cranky in any way, will be quite effec-
tive. (2) No, but if you wish to use a
higher capacity in mica condensers connect two
or three ,01’s in parallel.

What kind of matting gives the best service
on a concrete wicket ? A concrete pitch has
just been laid down on our school ground,
and argument arises as to whether coir or canvas
is the better matting. —4326.
The general opinion is that a canvas mat
on a concrete wicket gives a result very similar
to a good turf wicket. The objection to the
coir mat is that it gives art unnatural result
as far as spin bowling is concerned, thereby
giving the bowler unwarranted assistance, and
making it extremely difficult for the batsman
to make the correct shots. Experts can in-
variably pick the batsman who has played on
a coir mat, because his shots are made in an
unorthodox manner, as a result of attempting
to cope with an unnatural ball, but the bats-
man who has been accustomed to the canvas
mat plays his strokes correctly.

There are cargo boats trading between
Sydney and New Guinea at odd intervals, but
as these are “tramps” it is not possible to
give an itinerary of the ports of call. They
do not carry passengers, and the likelihood of
any person being able to secure a position as
supercargo is very remote. These vessels sail

Origin and significance of the Military Cross ?
—4606.
The decoration was instituted on Dec. 28,
1914, to reward distinguished services by
officers up to the rank of captain and first-
and second-class warrant officers. Bars may
be added for additional acts of gallantry.
Since August 1, 1918, the Military Cross, like
the D. 5.0., has been awarded for services in
action only. It is worn immediately after all
orders and before all decorations and medals
save the V.C.
1 was taught at school that Julius Ccesar
summed up his campaign in Britain in the
utterance “Veni, vidi, vici.” A friend says
that the phrase was applied to an earlier cam-
paign and that it was not uttered but written.
Which version is correct ? —4609.
According to Suetonius, at the public triumph
after Julius Caesar’s victories in Pontus, the
three words were displayed before Casar’s title,
not as being a record of the events of the
war, as in other cases, but as an indication
of the rapidity with which it was concluded.
Suetonius does not ascribe the words to Caesar,
but Plutarch, writing a few years later, in his
“Life of Julius Caesar” says that after Caesar
had defeated Pharnaces at Zela, in Pontus, a
kingdom of Asia Minor (b.c. 47), “in the account
he gave to Aminlus, one of his friends in
Rome, of the rapidity and despatch with which
he had gained his victory, he made use of
three words only, ‘I came, I saw, I con-
quered.’ ” Plutarch adds to this that “their
having all the same form and termination in the
Roman language adds grace to their concise-
ness.” There is no authority for the story that
the words were applied by Caesar to his cam-
paign in Britain, which was protracted and
only partially successful.

(1) French biological chemist; born at D6le,
December 27, 1822, and educated at the Ecole
Normale, Paris, he became a professor of
physics and chemistry. He first attracted notice
by his solution of the problem presented by
isomerism, which led to his discoveries con-
nected with fermentation. He showed that
vinous, acetous and lactic fermentations were
caused by micro-organisms existing in the air,
and he formulated methods for the prevention
of “diseases” in wines, beer, etc. He also
isolated bacillus of anthrax, a discovery which
led to his preparation of vaccines for fowl
cholera, rabies and diphtheria. (2) No record to
this effect. He died at the age of 72.
(1) Is rabies prevalent among dogs in Aus-
tralia ? (2) How is rabies spread among animals

(1) It is unknown in Australia. (2) It may
be communicated to man or to other animals
by the saliva of the infected beast entering a
cut or wound, or by a bite.
Why do some aluminium kettles spit ? —4527.
The spitting is caused by accumulated steam
pressure in water whose only air outlet is
through the spout, and is a common fault of
badly-designed kettles. To rectify, bore a
tiny hole either in the lid or at the back below
the handle where it joins the body of the
kettle; the latter position is the safer, as there
is no danger of scalding the hand when
pouring out the boiling water.
Recipe for making and cooking a damper in
a campfire ? —4500.
Make up a fire of small sticks and let it
burn out to a rich glowing mass. Place some
flour in a basin, self-raising or plain, the latter
having baking-powder added in the proportions
stated on the tin; add also a good pinch of
salt. Mix all well together with a dry knife,
then mix to a light dough with warm water.
Toss it up with a dash of flour to facilitate
dry handling, and, without working or kneading
it, place it in the fire- in a scooped-out hollow,
then draw the embers over it. Let cook for
20 to 30 minutes, or longer according to the
size of the damper; try with a clean twig or
thin knife, which should come out clean if
cooked. If any dough adheres to the knife,
the cooking is not finished. Take out of the
ashes, flick the loaf clean with a tea-towel, then
wrap in the towel for a few minutes to steam;
should be eaten hot. A little ash is beneficial
rather than harmful. To make a rich damper,
use this liquid for mixing the dough: Place in
the bottom of a cup or basin a lump of butter
or good dripping, pour on enough boiling water
to melt it, then cool by adding cold water or
milk to the required amount of liquid and use
at once. This is better than rubbing the fat
into the flour. Takes a little longer to cook.

(1) Requires expert knowledge. Genuine

figures are written. In copies, the figures 17 are
usually printed. (2) The mark was used by

of preventing a smudgy line which appears
between double-spaced typewritten matter,
especially on stiff envelopes ? —4446.
(1) Scrub thoroughly with a strong scrubbing
brush and very hot soapy water containing a
generous quantity of washing soda. Constantly
renew the water as it becomes blackened. When
quite dry, paint the boards with raw linseed-oil
containing a little turpentine as a drier ; apply
thoroughly but sparingly. (2) On all shift-key
machines each type-head is occupied by two
letters or figures; when the paper being used
is very stiff, it stands up and does not lie
flatly on the platen, so that it receives a faint
impression from the upper letter or figure at
every stroke. You may be able to get an
attachment from the agents for your typewriter
to overcome the trouble.
Best position and soil for growing nastur-
tiums ?~— 4613.
Rich soil and shady situations must be
avoided, especially with the Tom Thumb varie-
ties. The nasturtium revels in ground that is
lacking in rich plant food. Manuring pro-
duces leaves, not flowers.
Best situation for growing dahlias? —4610.
Position should be open to sunshine and
permit of a free circulation of air about the
plants.
(1) Any advantage in making one s own
inks for printing etchings ? (2) Pigments and
oils used in inks and method of mixing ? (3)
What kind of inks give the best proofs?—
4603.
(1) Most experienced etchers prefer to mix
their own because it is possible to prepare the
right consistency and tone for each separate
plate. (2) and (3) Burnt linseed oil, which
comes in three different consistencies, and Frank-
furt black are the foundation of almost all
etching ink. Other good blacks are both heavy
and light French black for certain kinds of
prints, and another called Bougou. For _ sepia
prints, burnt umber of the drop variety is the
best brown, but Japanese brown and red can
be useful. Frankfurt black, heavy French and
a little burnt umber give a good body and
pleasing tone. Forcing black is handy for an
underbitten . plate. When making a colored
ink be careful to use only earth colors. Brown
inks will be found to set much more quickly
than black ones. To make up, grind the powder
well with a muller on a stone or marble slab,
and then grind in the oil a few drops at a
time until the required consistency is reached..
If a slight surface tone is wanted on the print,
the ink should be rather sloppy and mixed with
thin oil, but for a heavily-bitten plate stiff ink
is best.
Best way to mount etchings and engravings ?
—4598.
Employ a double mount and hinge the print
to the back one with white adhesive paper
such as is sold to stamp collectors. Only
the best white cardboard is suitable for the
back; strawboard will stain the print should
it become damp. The front mount can be
cut from any good-quality white or cream
drawing paper, and should be cut out suffici-
ently to show £in. of the print’s white margin
on three sides and £in. at the bottom where the
edition number and the signature of the artist
will be. A good general size is from 3 in. to
4in. at top and sides, and sin. or 6in. at
the bottom. Attach the front mount to the
back by bending Tin. over the top and fixing
with photographic paste.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
WILLEYING PAYS.
“Murrawong”: One of the greatest
burdens of the outback woolgrower is
cost of marketing. Wool grown under
arid western conditions cannot compete
with the clean, bright clips of the N.S.W.
slopes and tablelands.
The drawback is not merely in appear-
ance. Dust or sand in a fleece lowers
its yielding capacity and value.
A 3001 b. bale of New England wool
may, scoured, return 2201 b. of actual
wool to the manufacturer, whereas 3001 b.
of dusty backs from a West Darling clip
may only contain 701 b; of actual wool.
It follows lhat the buyer must allow
not only for the low-yielding property
of the parcel, but must have the line
scoured before shipping, or else buy the
lot at such a low rate that the 701 b. of
wool can carry the freight on 3001 b.
When wool prices are good practically
everything that comes off the sheep is
sent to market and is profitable. But
when prices drop freight and other mar-
keting charges don’t, and much low-grade
wool is sent for sale, the price of which
barely balances the cost of freight, press-
ing, etc.
Where space is available the prudent
grower will hold on to such low lines
as locks, crutchings and dead wool until
values make their sale worth' while, but
stacking space is scarce.
A few large properties scour their low-
grade wools on the spot, while a few
more ship to the coast before scouring.
The latter procedure shows little saving,
as freight up to 1000 miles saddles it with
a handicap that only a good sale will
overcome. In addition, the market for
locally-scoured wool is limited.
Willeying, therefore, is coming into
its own. The process consists of opening
up the wool and removing dust and im-
purities by oscillation, centrifugal action
and air draughts. The cost of installing
the machine is less than twice the price
of a woolpress. Running expenses, in-
cluding labor, amount to approximately
id. per lb. on treated wool. Besides re-
moving dust, the machine will free wool
of Bathurst burr, and might deal with
Noogoora.
One station last shearing removed
6i tons of dirt and about 5 bushels of
Bathurst burr from 236 bales of wool.
Freight and selling charges from that
station to saleroom amount to lid.
per lb.
The saving in freight alone was £73,
while a further £lO was saved in pressing
and cost of packs. In addition, allow-
ance must be made for the enhanced
value of the wool. Previous to willeying,
those low-yielding wools were bought by
local scourers for treatment and resale ;
now the willeyed wools are open to over-
seas competition.
The following willeying statistics from
a western property for 1930 and 1931
illustrate the advantages of the process:
1930. 1931.
Gross weight of wool
treated, lb.-.. .. 125,682 112,814
Dust, etc., extracted, lb. 28,947 23,125
Percentage extracted .. 23 , 20.5
Amount saved in .freight, '
etc., at lid £l5O/15/4 £l2O/8/10
The balance in favor of treatment,
allowing ird. per net lb. to cover" cost,
was £77. The wool treated comprised
dusty backs and locks, and these were
sold beside untreated locks by way of
comparison. The prices realised per lb.
were:
Untreated. Willeyed.
Backs .. 4.5 d. 7.32 d. per lb.
Locks .. 1.5 d. 2.5 d. per lb. 1
On 670 bales treated in the course of
two shearings the enhanced return
amounted to over £9OO at depression
prices.
Another property in 1930 offered the
clip for sale untreated. The wool was
very dusty and carried a fair amount of
burr. At auction 57 bales were passed in,
the best bids being 2d. per lb. This wool
was removed from the store and willeyed
at a cost of Id. per lb. The weight
of foreign matter extracted reduced the
offering from 57 to 40 bales, which were
re-offered in three lots. Prices obtained
were 7|d., B}d. and 13id. If the original
57 bales had been sold at the passed-in
price they would, have realised £166.
Add to this the cost of willeying, £57,
making a total of £223. The 40 bales
of treated wool realised £342, showing
an enhanced value of £ll9.
Apart from dusty backs . and locks,
crutchings, stained pieces and dead wool
may be profitably treated. Last March’
a line of willeyed dead wool from west-
ern N.S.W. realised \l\&. at auction. It
should be realised, however, that the
wool should be processed at shearing
time.
The machine can comfortably handle
20-25 bales per eight-hour day.
WET WOOL.
“Dead Finish”: “Murrawong” (B.
7/11 /’34), seemingly, is ignorant of the
distinction between “damp” and “wet”
wool. One of the most valuable proper-
ties of wool is its power to absorb mois--
ture. It is impossible to get any . wool-
scoured or greasy—which has been ex-
posed to ordinary atmospheric condi-
tions 100 per cent. dry. ; On New Eng-
land and Monaro (N;S.W.) in some
seasons shearing would be a protracted
job if we had to wait until the rouse-
abouts told us sheep were dry enough to
shear. Being on a weekly wage, it is
to their interest to see the job lasts as
long as possible, so their opinions on
“wet sheep” can be dispensed with. It
frequently happens that the shedhands
urge the shearers to “have a go at ’em
with the juice in” when there is a pos-
sibility of their missing a good run of
sheds.
It is the duty of the classer to gauge
the amount of moisture in any line of
wool he may be handling, and make a
decision as to whether he is justified in
baling it. It is safe practice for him
to visualise the wool opened up on the
show floor. This will help him to arrive
at a decision whether to allow the
shearers to continue. Under no condi-
tions should wet wool be pressed. It in-
variably opens up in a musty, unattrac-
tive condition, and frequently the buyers
will demand its removal from the floor
to be reconditioned.
Wet wool is easily felt, particularly on
the points and bellies. Damp wool is
harder to detect. If the wool has only
slight moisture in it one of the best
methods of determining its condition is to
handle the fleeces immediately they are
thrown out on the rolling-tables. Dry
wool is warm —wet wool is cold.
Some people hold a fleece up to their
face to gauge the degree of dampness ;
others smell it. I prefer to handle
the wool immeciiately it comes off the
jumbuck’s back. It then has the natural
amount of warmth that assists in deter-
mining its condition.
NECK WOOL.
“B-gar”: “Mouton” (B. 14/11/’34j
won’t find many woolmen agree with
him. It is not the description of wool in
the packs that interests buyers, but yield
and spinning, capacity.
In many Queensland clips neck wool
brings as much as, and in some cases
more than, the leading fleece lines simply
because it is finer, better grown and better
yielding than the balance of the fleece.
Prices obtained in October last for the
Northampton Downs clip in London
prove this. Fleece lines sold from 8-j-d.
to 9fd., whilst the neck wool realised from
9}d. to 9|d. The exception doesn’t prove
; the .rule, but owners of big clips in
' Queensland who insist on the necks being
taken- out know from experience how
payable the procedure is.
If only for the difference in spinning
quality in merinos from the neck- to the
breech, it is a wise classer who takes off
not only the neck but the breech as well.
Fleece lines uniform in quality are im-
possible unless this procedure is followed.
BLOWFLIES AGAIN. * ' ‘
“G.F.D.”: “Albarmount” says meat
allowed to get maggoty and then soaked
in arsenic water is a good bait for
primary flies (B. 7/11/’34).
A Queensland Agricultural Depart-
ment pamphlet says:
Primary flies are only attracted to the
bait whilst it remains comparatively fresh.
Little result can be expected from trapping
unless a bait can be discovered which will
remain attractive to primary flies over a
comparatively long period. Maggots of
secondary flies not only render the flesh
unsuitable to the primary fly maggots, but,
being more robust, are more successful in
the competition for the available food, and
as a result a good percentage of the
primary fly maggots are driven from the'
carcass and die. It will be seen that these
secondary flies act as a control over the
numbers of primary flies, and a wholesale
destruction of their maggots might result
. in an increase in the number of primary
flies, upon which the initiation of strike
depends to a large extent.
Tell “Peggoty” (B. 14/11/’34) that 1
tended one of many traps all over
Queensland. All traps were emptied
weekly and contents forwarded to Mr.
Roberts, the Government Entomologist,
who used them in the course of his
investigations.
“Albarmount”: “Tarboy’s” experi-
ment (B. 28/11 /’34), resulting in no
diminution of strikes after catching
millions of flies with 25 traps in a thou-
sand-acre paddock, goes to bear out my
previous suggestion that baited traps
decoy the blowies from adjoining
paddocks.
Like the grasshopper, the fly is too
mobile to test the efficacy of any method
of destruction over a small area —parti-
cularly if the method used requires a
decoy. An area with at least 50-mile
radius would be necessary.
Unfortunately for these small experi-
menters their neighbor’s blowies, unlike
his rabbits, cannot be kept out with a
netting fence.
WOOLPACKS.
“Sheepo”: The Wool Industries Re-
search Assoc., Leeds, has lately evolved a
pack with possibilities—jute with rubber
latex, which has the advantages over
ordinary rubber that it will not perish,
is more elastic and will withstand sea-
water. Tests made in England proved
it will anchor the jute fibres and reduce
manufacturers’ complaints to nil. Sample
packs are being forwarded to the various
Dominions for a thorough trial. Tests
are also being carried out with packs
treated with cellulose.
As “Murrawong” (B. 14/11/’34) says,
growers who use the paper- or linen-
lined packs receive no encouragement
from buyers. Several times where half
of the leading fleece line was put up in
the lined packs and the other half in the
common or garden variety the former
realised id. to id. less per lb.
’HOPPERS AND HARD FACTS.
“Valerin”: In many parts of N. S.
Wales the ’hoppers are sweeping every-
thing before them. Even in the denser
settled areas to hold them is a Sisyphean
job—as soon as one swarm has been
dealt with another is ready to take its
place. This continuous hatching may be
an abnormality due to climatic condi-
tions, or it might be a new phase.
Opinions expressed by practical men —
W. W. Killen, V. J. McCutcheon —on the
possible destruction of birds and insects
by poisonous baits cannot be lightly dis-
missed. In the early ’nineties, when the
poison-cart was welcomed as the solution
of the rabbit problem, similar warnings
were ignored. To-day we know the cost.
If - carefully distributed the baits are
(Continued on page 52.)
£25 FOR SUCCESS STORIES.
Mostly Australia hears of her farming failures, but there are many men
on the land who have a romantic record of success —men who started out,
with little capital, on rough scrub land, and made good despite low prices,
bad communications and high taxes; men who bought properties on which
others had failed and made them pay; men who began with nothing but
stock knowledge as capital and turned it to good account; men to whom
pasture improvement has brought a competence.
“The Bulletin” is offering prizes for stories of success in any branch
of farming, written by the parties themselves or by others to whom, the facts
have been communicated. If the latter, proofs of genuineness must be
furnished.
First prize £2O
Second prize £3
Third prize £2
And ten “Bulletin” drawings by well-known artists. Space rates will
be paid for all non-prizewinning efforts published.
A story must not exceed eight hundred words in length. It must be
sent in an envelope addressed to the Editor and marked “Success Competition”
not later than January 31 next. The Editor’s decisions and awards will
be final.

harmless to birds, but slovenly work
makes baiting a menace. On several
places I have seen the bait thrown out in
lumps.
Where ’hoppers are on the wing the
next step is to concentrate on destroying
their laying beds. Otherwise the country
will be faced with disaster in the autumn.
Now is the time to act.
"Wen”: A device tried out on Avroe
station, Moree, may give the ’hoppers a
shock: a screen of copper-wire, con-
nected to insulators and suspended be-
tween two cars. The current is supplied
from the car generators, and the screen
is drawn through the swarms. In the
thick swarms it was found that ’hoppers
were killed merely through coming in
contact with their electrified brethren on
the screen. Two and a half volts caused
the wings and legs to drop off. The
screen can be made of any length to suit
the country worked. Further experi-
ments are to be carried out.
BINDER-KNOTTER HINTS.
“Hope Vale”: The binder-knotter does
not merit the awe it inspires in many
farmers. All its troubles yield to com-
monsense.
If it fails to tie look for foreign sub-
stance in the knotter-beak. If one end of
the band is found clinging to the knotter-
h'ook and the other end has the appear-
ance of having been tied the clamp for
the cord-ring holder is too loose.
If the loose end has been broken off
the clamp is too tight. The clamp should
be set to resist a pull of 201 b., but no
more.
If the band is thrown out loose with
the sheaf and both ends have been cut off
squarely and have apparently been tied
the knotter- spring is too loose. If the
the band has been broken and one or
both ends are left clinging very tightly
to the knotter-beak the knotter-spring
is too tight. Or this last trouble may be
due to too much tension on the twine.
If the knots have a frayed look and
come undone when the sheaf is handled
rotate the knotter slowly and see if the
beak opens properly. If it does not draw
out the head of the beak so that the cam
will force it to open wider.
If the twine is not pushed far enough
into the beak set the cord holding ring
farther forward.
FISTULA.
“Sorghum”: Fistulous withers, due to
an abscess forming from a bite from an-
other horse or a badly-fitting collar, can
be treated in the early stages by the
farmer or horse-owner himself.
When the fistula is first suspected, try
the following. Apply alternate hot and
cold fomentations to abort the swelling.
Failing that, a blister of one part bin-
iodide of mercury to seven parts lard
may be applied to the swelling to bring
it to a head.
The abscess should be then opened at
the lowest part with a sharp, sterilised
knife, using the point only, and making
sure the knife does not penetrate too
deeply.
Clean out the pus and wash the cavity
with a hot washing-soda solution. The
caustic will not only destroy the disease
germs, but will burn out the infected
tissue and leave a healthy surface for
healing. The soda-water solution (one
tablespoon to a quart of water) should
not be hot enough to risk scalding the
wound. The caustic will do that work.
In severe cases always call a vet. if
available.
TOMATO-BLOSSOM SCAR.
“Wilt-resistant”: From this blemish
(otherwise “catface”) some varieties are
practically immune ; others suffer heavily,
The cause is a tiny grub, barely visible.
Examine a tomato blossom and note the
small tube formed by the anthers round
the pistil. A moth bores through the side
of this tube and lays eggs on the ovule
at the foot of the style.
The grubs, usually one or two,
hatch out in time to start work after the
blossom has fertilised the ovule, and is
being discarded by the fruit.
In varieties immune from “blossom
scar” the anther tube, immediately the
fruit has set, rises up on the style clear
of the ovule (young tomato), leaving no
shelter for the blossom grub. With sus-
ceptible varieties this action takes place
on a portion of the fruit only, and those
develop free from the scar. On most of
the balance, the anther tube drops from
the foot of the pistil towards the sepals
on one side, forming a triangular tent
like a sheath. Under this shelter, which
may remain intact for a week or longer,
the grub feeds along the surface of the
tender young tomato from the foot' of
the style towards the stalk, which ac-
counts for “blossom scar” always radiat-
ing from the pistil scar and appearing on
one side of the fruit only.
At first the damage appears slight, but
the damaged portion enlarges with the
growth of the tomato.
Selection is the remedy. Examine the
bushes carefully when the fruit is setting
and select' for seed the plants that have
the smallest proportion of clinging
anther sheaths. In this way, it is possible
to produce a strain free from scar.
FENCING POSTS.
“Dry Blow”: “Sprinkler” might be
right about stakes (B. 24/10/’34), but 1
don’t agree with him about iron posts
lifting out of the ground. These are just
the thing the doctor orders in a limberless
area. Not long ago I drove home 15
miles of such fencing. With a sledge-
hammer and the topper for the posts I
could do two miles a day with ease.
Iron posts are there for life. They
don’t burn, rot or perish, and neither are
they subject to white-ants.
In a timbered area wooden posts cer-
tainly are cheaper, and if a man has to
cart his posts anything over 50 miles that
doesn’t apply.
Taking it for granted that the costs are
somewhere nearly equal, a wooden post
stays in position for all time. And sup-
pose iron posts do lift slightly in 20
years? One man, leading his saddle-
horse and carrying a sledge-hammer, can
replace two miles a day. What about it?
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Whalebone”: When digging out
rabbit burrows always throw the dirt
out of the trench. Rabbits will seldom
reopen burrows located in this way.
“G.F.D.”: For pink-eye try a pinch of
boracic acid dusted into each eye.
Muster the whole flock and treat each
one. We registered a 100 p.c. cure after
two treatments.
“Valerin”: If it is possible draft off
fly-struck sheep, treat them and put in
a clean observation paddock. Often it is
necessary to handle them again, and this
prevents the main flock being knocked
about. It also reduces infestation of
clean sheep by contact with the struck
ones.
“Hope Vale”: A useful socket wrench
for inaccessible nuts can be made from
a piece of iron piping. Heat the end, and
hammer it into approximately the right
shape. Then force a nut into it, and
hammer to make a perfect fit. One end
of the pipe can be made hexagonal and
the other square and a hole drilled
through the middle for a tommy bar. A
half-inch pipe will make a wrench for a
|in. nut.
“Bull-ant Bill”: A 40-gallon petrol-
drum, with one sector cut off to leave an
opening 21 in. or so wide, makes a useful
bath. The return in the sides prevents
splashing. It is supported in a rectangu-
lar wooden frame, with a 3in. smooth
rim fitted close above the cut edges all
round. A socket and plug are soldered
into the bottom near one end and the
inside given three thin coats of alu-
minium paint. It is economic with water
and surprisingly spacious—I’m 6ft. and
14st., but, cross-legged, it gives me lots
of room. The cut-off piece makes a
good feed-trough.
“Valerin”: At our last P. P. Board
meeting (Riverina) the rabbit inspector
explained how numerous the rabbits
were on a property. “They’re so thick
they have to line-up at the burrow holes
and wait their turn to get in.” We de-
cided to prosecute for overcrowding.

“Must have got in over the top in the
storm last night,” suggested another.
The old commander continued his prod-
ding as conscientiously as his unsteady
perch in the dinghy would allow, while
Mr. Pushpont and his followers kicked
their heels on the beach and rapidly
lost faith in the existence of the shark.
“It’s impossible,” said Mr. Pushpont.
“Imagination, that’s all. The net is quite
sharkproof.”
TOWARDS four o’clock the crowd had
lost interest in the fishing experiment,
and was drifting away. Mr. Pushpont re-
called the dinghy and again mounted
the platform. The shivering lifesavers
and swimmers took up their positions,
and the Scouts and Guides were hastily
lined up once more.
Summoned by the band, the crowd re-
turned.
The Mayor decided that it would be
wise to cut his speech short and
to cancel all other speeches. He apolo-
gised for the hold-up and deprecated the
rumor that had been spread. The prod-
ding operations, he claimed, proved con-
clusively that there was no shark within
the enclosure. (Murmurs of dissent.)
“I will not delay you any longer,”
said Mr. Pushpont. “I know you are all
anxious to have your first safe swim.”
The two small Pushponts raised aloft
the knot. The lifesavers and swimmers,
glancing apprehensively at each other,
made ready for the signal.
“Let other beaches make what claims
they please,” continued the Mayor. “Let
them belittle our efforts as they may.
Let them spread malicious rumors within
our very doors. We hurl their lies in
their teeth! Whorple is sharkproof!”
He cut the knot. The lifesavers dashed
forward, but simultaneously there arose
again from the crowd loud shouts.
“There it is! Shark! Look out!”
The first-plungers were under way.
The enclosure loomed up before them.
It is claimed as one of the great benefits
of lifesaving work that it encourages in-
itiative and helps a man to come to quick
decisions in a crisis.
The Whorple men were well trained.
A crisis was at hand, and not a man
failed. As they reached the water they
split into two groups. Half went to the
left and half to the right, and the entire
body plunged almost simultaneously into
the water, just outside the boundaries of
the safety enclosure. The swimming club
followed the lifesavers, and the crowd (or
such members of it as were attired for
sudden immersion in the water) followed
the swimming club.
Never before had the sea at Whorple
held so many swimmers. To the left
of the net they swam and splashed. To
the right of the net they swam and
splashed. Out beyond the net they
swam, almost without a splash.
But within the net —that noble struc-
ture that was to place Whorple on the
map for evermore —not a soul ventured
Here the shark swam alone.
IT was not for any reasons of modesty
that Mr. Pushpont took the narrow,
unfrequented lanes that ran behind the
Hotel Ozone. It was merely his short
cut home.
But when he saw Mr. Joseph Whiffle
standing at the back entrance he
wished he had gone the longer way. It
was too late to turn back, however.
The publican had seen him.
“Well,” said Mr. Whiffle. “I’ll take
it all back. It was a great idea after all.”
Mr. Pushpont saw red.
“Look here,” he commenced, but could
get no further. Pent-up disappointment
and indignation got the better of him.
He merely spluttered.
“Yes,” went on Mr. Whiffle serenely.
“It’s a great idea. Y’ put the net there
an’ catch the sharks, and then everyone
can bathe in safety. Mr. Pushpont, I
take my hat off to you.”
My Political
Life
By W. A.HOLMAN
THE
BRIDGE
But a much
more desperate
plunge into, the
unknown was still
before us. We had learned that no
transport scheme for Sydney would work
which did not provide in some way for
crossing the harbor, and we steeled our-
selves for the perennial problem of a
bridge.
This project—a definite part of Gov-
ernment policy since the year 1838
had been abandoned in despair by each
succeeding Government ever since. The
actual residents on the North Shore
found in it a theme for execration and
curses not loud but deep, while to the
rest of the country its mere mention was
the occasion for sceptical ribaldry.
Sydney is a strangely lopsided city.
Instead of its harbor dividing it into two
roughly equal residential areas, the popu-
lation of the south side outnumbers that
of the north by nearly five to one.
AN earlier Minister for Works, E. W.
O’Sullivan, had striven manfully with
this disequilibrium. He had actually
called tenders for a bridge, and in the
Bavin,
meanwhile built
more new tram-
lines to open up
the less accessible
portions of the
North Shore.
The Carruthers
Government,
however, had
abandoned all in-
ter e s t in the
bridge, and the
only effect of the
new tramlines
had been to
markedly increase
the dividends of
the private com-
panies controlling
the connecting
ferryboats. These
eminently successful bodies encountered
every passenger deposited by the tram-
way management upon their wharves
and extracted fares from him on his way
to the business area on the south side.
It is difficult to overstate the intricacy
of the channels through which, without
chart or soundings, we now had to find
our way. We called upon the Works
Department for bridge designs, which
were forthcoming.
The mention of the bridge, however,
at once brought forth a counter agitation
for a tunnel.
“W h y build
bridges,” we
were asked,
“which must be
a perpetual eye-
sore to all lovers
of the beautiful
and which are a
menace to navi-
gation, when all
the traffic can
be carried under
the harbor?”
Example was
joined to pre-
ceptin the
shape of the
Bradfield.
subways under
the Thames and the Mersey.
OPPONENTS
OF THE
BRIDGE
Ex-Premier
Wade, himself
one of the North
Shore members,
had in 1908 ap-
pointed a Royal
Commission, which had reported in
favor of tunnels —three of them—tor
railways, trams and vehicles respectively,
and no bridge at all. This was a further
powerful recommendation of that course.
Other questions which arose were: If
we built a bridge, should it be a low-
level bridge with a swing to let shipping
through, or was it to be a high-level
bridge? If it were to be a high-level
bridge, how were we to get an approach
to it on either side? Was it to carry
trains? Was it to carry trams? If so,
how were we going to reconcile the
safety of it with a swing construction?
Was vehicular traffic to pass over with-
out a toll? Had we any other scheme
for financing the cost? What was the

READ WHAT THIS WONDERFUL
TONIC FOOD DID FOR OTHERS
Think what it can do for you and yours!
A DOCTOR SAYS
“I have some very nice things to
say about Itoboleine. It is the
finest preparation I have come
across. I had a case recently of an
infant who was declining rapidly.
They tried everything at the Clinic
with no avail. All I did was to
cut down his .feed and put him on
Roboleine. He picked up almost
immediately and has never looked
back since. I shall be delighted
to recommend wherever possible.”
A NURSE SAYS
“I feel I must write and tell you of
the wonderful results obtained from
Robolelne in the case of a child of
4 years suffering from very severe
kidney trouble. When I took charge
of her after leaving the hospital,
she could not walk or keep any food
down. She had absolutely no flesh
on her bones and her skin was a
pale yellow. After 2 weeks on
Roboleine she had gained in weight
and her appetite had greatly im-
proved. Now, 8 weeks later, she is
a strong, healthy child, firmly and
well covered and is soon to com-
mence school.”
The secret of Roboleine’s success is the RED and YELLOW BONE
MARROW that it contains, together with “VITAD”, which is the
essence of cod liver oil without the nauseating taste. Combined in
a special way with other of Nature’s own body-building foods such as
“CREAM OF MALT”, EGG YOLK and LEMON JUICE, the MARROW
and “VITAD” put Roboleine in a class of its own. There can be no
substitute for Roboleine. Only small doses of this delicious food are
required to achieve the remarkable results described above, so that it
is very economical in use.

total expense likely to be, and how could
we justify the withdrawing from other
and legitimate purposes of development
in the backblocks the large sums in-
volved? Country interests were on the
whole solidly against us. The ferry com-
panies, a by no means inconsiderable
influence, no less so.
A further alternative which actually
got a footing with us for a while was
a scheme combining bridge and tunnel
—a bridge for trams, vehicles and foot
passengers and tubes for trains.
ENTER
MR. BRADFIELD
Through all
this conflict of
expert opinion
we had to make
our way as best we could. Whether we
would ever have
succeeded by the
light of our un-
aided sagacity may
be doubted.
Providence raised
up to our aid at
this moment Brad-
field, then a com-
paratively unknown
member of the
Works Depart-
ment staff. He was
gifted with the
closest approach to
complete genius in
engineering matters
that I have ever
met. Bradfield saw
the whole problem
of city transport just
as the poet saw life
—he saw it steadily
and saw it whole—
and guided by him
we tried and re-
jected one after
another the dis-
tracting fallacies
which were being
thrust upon our at-
tention from many

original idea.
sides. The conclusions at which we
arrived may be tabulated thus:
1. A cheap bridge would not do at all.
Whatever our plans might ultimately boil
down into they must provide for tram and
train and vehicular traffic.
2. This necessity, too, made a single
tunnel impossible. At least three tunnels
would be required.
3. Three tunnels would cost more than
any bridge of any kind, and the tunnel pro-
posal was therefore at this stage stamped
out.
4. A low-level bridge was impracticable.
5. The Railway Commissioners must pay
an adequate sum in recognition of the
saving which direct communication with
the north meant to them.
(Hitherto their northern service had had
to make a wide detour to cross the har-
bor at a point very much further in-
land.) This sum could be set off against
the interest bill, leaving the balance only
to be met from other sources to be deter-
mined.
6. Finally, a high-level bridge answering
all requirements could be built for about
£4,000,000, and could be completed in
about seven years.
This measure of
determination was
arrived at before
the return of our
chief, and the Min-
ister for Works
undertook, with
Bradfield’s aid, to
bring the whole
scheme into work-
ing shape, and
bring it again be-
fore later Cabinets
for final submis-
sion to the Works
Committee and to
Parliament.
How it was that
nothing further
was done in this
matter for some 18
months is a point
I shall endeavor to
clear up later on.
What these things were represented as
costing the country.
THE
FOOD SUPPLY
Another abso-
lutely new region
into which I
turned my own
footsteps at an early moment was the
investigation of Sydney’s food supply.
There was nothing known authentically
about this. The Government Statistician
had nothing on the subject.' The Agricul-
ture Department nothing either. The
Health Department just a little —in the
way of inspection, guaranteeing purity
and so on, but nothing more. Realising
that you cannot legislate to do a thing
better in future unless you have some
idea of how it has been done in the past,
I resolved to get this information to-
gether. A Royal Commission was ap-
pointed, comprising nine persons, under
the chairmanship of Mr. Bavin, who was
not then a member of either House.
Among its members was Mrs. Dwyer,
a lady of distinguished character and
capacity, who had been a leading
figure of our movement for years, and
who undertook to see that the woman’s
point of view should not be neglected on
the commission.
The commission started its labors by
investigating the fish supply of Sydney,
and brought in a report upon which,
later on, important action was taken. It
went on to deal with meat, upon which
subject a series of enactments were
carried ultimately, also based upon its
findings. At a later stage, finding that its
constitution was a little too cumbrous
for rapid action, we
disbanded it, and
Bavin was ap-
pointed alone as a
comm issioner to
cover the remain-
ing sections of the
field. This he did,
and a. series of re-
ports on such
things as the milk,
fruit and vegetable
supply of Sydney,
all of great value,
were prepared by
him.
It is part of the
irony of fate that
Government trawl-
ers, which were
largely set up as
the outcome of
Bavin’s strenuous
and enlightened
labors in this field,
should have been
finally abolished by
a Government in
which he held a
distinguished posi-
tion. That, how-
ever, is another
story, and a matter which I shall
discuss in its place. For the moment I
am concerned to make this claim—that
we were the first Government in Aus-
tralia to stir in connection with the high
cost of living, and that at a time when
that now too familiar conception had
not begun to be indicated by initials, and
that we went to work in the right way
by collecting the information essential
to action.
A SOCIAL incident of this period which
deserves to be classed as a real
event was the launching of the Warrego
on April 5, 1911.
The Warrego was one of a group of
warships built by the various States at
the request of the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment, and, as we were a good deal
ahead of our competitors in time, it was
actually the first warship ever completed
in Australia. The occasion was looked
upon as a special one. Most official
business was suspended. The Judges of
the High Court,
which happened to
be sitting in Syd-
ney, took the day
off to witness the
ceremony, and
after the launch-
ing, which was en-
tirely successful,
there were toasts
and enthusiasm at
the succeeding ban-
quet. A. E. Cutler,
superintendent of
Cockatoo Dock, a
public servant of
the highest type—
to whom I shall
have further occa-
sion to refer in the
course of these
notes —was warmly
and deservedly con-
gratulated. As a
Government, too, we distinctly profited
by the success. This had been a unique
effort in Australian history, and in it
we had beaten the Victorian Govern-
ment badly. Some merit in administra-
tion had to be granted us.
Giving, as was proper, the main credit
to Cutler and his expert officers, at least
we had allowed the experts their heads.
And a great many competent judges saw
this, and admitted that we had done
better than they expected. The little
ceremony that followed helped. We had
a very representative gathering, includ-
ing many worthy citizens who knew very
little about Labor men ; and many who
had come to scoff remained to admit that
we were to be taken more seriously than
they had thought.

Illustration shows one of our
Melbourne installations.
Made to carry loads of 1, 5 and 1 0 cwt. by
easy and safe hand operation, the Auto-Static
Lift is a distinct economy where costly electric
lifts are out of the question. Factories,
Warehouses, Laundries, Contractors, Hotels
—in fact, wherever goods have to be lifted —
the Auto-Static Lift is a much cheaper and
quicker method than human carriage.
Positive Self-Acting Brake
The Auto-Static Hand-operated Lift has one
outstanding feature which makes it superior
to any other hand lift or Dumb Waiter.
The lift head is fitted with a positive simple
self-acting brake, and it is impossible to move
the cage except by pulling the hand rope
which automatically releases the brake. It is
this feature alone which makes it possible to
handle loads up to 10 cwt. The load is at all
times under the control of the operator, and
if for any reason the hand rope is released
the cage must stop. The risk of personal
injury or damage to fragile goods is com
pletely eliminated.
anufacturers, Contractors, Warehouses, Hotels, Restaurants
The Auto-Static Patent Lift is also made for continuous service, where two cages
are used, one going up as the other comes down. For either single or double lifts
there is no limit to the length of travel; they can serve any number of floors.
Your problem of lifting goods cheaply, quickly and conveniently can now be
solved. Send us particulars of the work you want to do: let us show. h6w simply

What the Trade Balance Means
The disturbing fall in the price of wool
and the reduction in dried-fruit and other
exports show up disconcertingly in Aus-
tralia’s trade balance for the four months
to the end of October. Exports of mer-
chandise for that period are down
£4,634,000 sterling, while bullion and
specie shipments moved up only £84,000.
In spite of the exchange rate, which still
adds 25 p.c. to the overseas cost, and
duties which had not been affected by
the latest amendments to the tariff
schedule, there was a rise of £6,205,000
in our imports bill. Actually, including
bullion shipments, on the four months
our figures were £1,022,000 to the bad,
as against a favorable balance of
£9,921,000 for the corresponding period
of 1933.
A slip on four months’ trading of
£10,943,000 sterling compared with last
year! In point of fact, we are import-
ing at a greater rate at the moment than
at any time since the emergency tariff was
introduced to steady the position. The
Commonwealth Statistician’s figures just
issued give import and export totals of
each of the 24 months to last October.
In August our overseas purchases leapt
(in millions sterling) from 5.5 to 6.95,
whereas in the whole of the preceding
21 months they had never exceeded six.
For each of the past three months our
imports have not been below £6,000,000,
and only in one month of the current
fiscal year—October—did our merchan-
dise exports exceed our imports.
Despite the unhappy weakening in
wool prices, which are almost as low
again as ever they were, the business and
investing community of Australia has
shown a stoutness of heart which was
absent when the bottom fell out of every-
thing under Lang’s regime. The breather
which everybody got during the spec-
tacular but short-lived recovery in wool
prices did a great deal more good than
just bringing extra millions into the
country. Nevertheless, local confidence
or local buoyancy in the share market
doesn’t help the farmer to get any more
for his wool or wheat overseas, and,
though it is best to face our difficulties
as cheerfully as we possibly can, the big
reductions in export figures show pretty
conclusively how land men are being hit
at the moment.
It has been shown before how
world statistics on wool have misled us.
There was no great accumulation of
stocks in any of the consuming centres,
yet, because impoverishment of some
countries has made them unable to buy,
and because, in other cases, of tariff
retaliations, Australia has been left with
a large wool clip on its hands and diffi-
dent buyers. Still, some millions of
people in the world who want our wool
are not getting as much of it as they
need, and while that state of affairs
exists there is always hope of better
prices.
Our present overseas trade position
shows, however, that hopes of exchange
reductions are still away in the future.
It also indicates that imports must be
curbed if we are to pay our overseas
interest bill without borrowing in Lon-
don. It will be a sad business if we have
to acknowledge that we are unable to
pay our way after the splendid results
of the past three years.
These Bonus Issues
Because an amendment to the Federal
Income Tax Act becomes operative at
the end of the year there has been an
epidemic of reserve capitalisations by
public companies during the past month.
In most cases the concerns handing out
the buckshee scrip had been under ob-
servation by hopeful investors for some
years ; the shareholders’ funds labelled
“reserves,” from which most of the bonus
scrip will be provided, have been on
plain view in practically every case since
pre-depression days.
When slump came and the earning
capacity of even the oldest-established
concerns shrank, the share market gave
up the tantalising pastime of speculating
about when opulent cos. would do the
Father Christmas act again. In boom
years the directors of a co. which
couldn’t maintain its old div. rate on new
as well as old scrip might reasonably
expect a cold reception at the next
annual general meeting. Reductions in
div. rates weren’t expected to go hand in
hand with bonus issues in those flush
days.
The C.S.R., Carlton and United
Breweries, J. Fielding, Washington H.
Soul and Goodyear Tyres are the prin-
“ ’Ullo, Joe! Thought you was
going away fer Christmas!”
cipal concerns engaged in melon-cutting
at the moment. These are cos. which
have been least affected by slump ;
though the total largesse involved is
£7,156,000 on paper, even if the actual
amount of div. distributions in each case
does not alter, the rate will be still quite
respectable on the enlarged capitals. Dis-
tributions in their last terms were C.S.R.
12y p.c., C. and U.B. 10 p.c., Fieldings
15 p.c., Washington Soul 12| p.c. and
Goodyear 16 p.c.
The position now will be that instead
of having two capital accounts in their
balance-sheets, one labelled “capital”
and the other “reserves,” part of the
companies’ “reserves” items will be
shown definitely as capital in each case.
There may also be disclosures of inner
strength in some instances. But profit-
earning will not be made the slightest
bit easier by these book entries, and in
cases where there was not much profit' to
spare after handing out last year’s div.
shareholders should expect little actual
augmentation of income. If there is any
it should come from general trading
improvements.
That is the principal difference between
the bonus issues of to-day and those of
five years ago. Div. rate reductions can
be looked for, notable increases in
shareholders’ incomes cannot be—not in
the immediate future, anyway. When con-
ditions do become prosperous again, of
course, the capital account which more
truly represents the shareholders’ funds
at work in a business should show a
truer and less provocative div. rate. There
is little likelihood of much hot-air being
pumped into capital accounts under
present conditions.
Wheat and Flour
The conference between Common-
wealth and State Ministers in Canberra
last week resulted in the recommenda-
tion, later approved by Lyons-Page, of
a flour tax of £2 12s. 6d. a ton on Aus-
tralian consumption. This is expected
to yield about £1,700,000 of the
£4,000,000 relief to wheatgrowers sug-
gested by the Wheat Commission; the
other £2,300,000 will be a charge on
ordinary Commonwealth revenue.
The wheat yield for 1933-34 was
39,000,000 bushels lower than for the
previous year, being the lightest since
1929-1930, which was before farmers had
the “Grow More Wheat” campaign
wished on them. Shipments of wheat
and flour for the season just closed
were the equivalent of 94.634,000
bushels, a decrease of 54,371,000
bushels. The figure was well within our
export quota as defined by the inter-
national agreement. There was a reluct-
ance on the part of farmers to sell their
grain early in the year because of low
prices ; better rates brought sellers out
toward the end of the season, but stock-
taking at its close showed a carryover of
30,000,000 bushels of 1933-34 wheat.
Estimated yield for the current season
is 130,000,000 bushels, of which local
consumption will account for about
50,000,000 bushels.
Now the International Wheat Com-
mittee proposes to reduce Australia’s ex-
port quota for the coming year from the
agreed 150,000,000 bushels to 100,000,000,
5,000,000 bushels less than last year’s
quota. This is part of a programme to
reduce the exports of all the signatory
countries by about 146,000,000 bushels.
The Australian Wheat Advisory Commit-
tee seems ready to compromise at
120,000,000 bushels provided “the agree-
ment is honorably observed by other sig-
natories” — i.e., Argentina, which last
year exceeded its original quota and is
this year to be granted an increase.
With a 100,000,000-bushel quota Aus-
tralia would veiy likely be embarrassed
with a 15,000,000-bushel surplus next
season.
Tariff Alterations
Twenty-six tariff increases were an-
nounced last week and 205 reductions —
almost equally divided between British
preferential and general items. The
most important articles affected are drills,
jeans and dungarees, the increases in duty
on which during August last created a
storm in Lancashire. The old tariff is
reverted to.
English biscuits, instead of being
subject to a duty of . 3d. a pound,
will now be admitted free. This,
together with 36 other reductions,
represents a revision of the
Scullin emergency tariff. Other
substantial cuts have been made on
fencing-wire, sheet-iron, mining
plant and materials, and some
chemicals.
“Many industries,” said Customs
Minister White when introducing
the schedule, “have to-day arrived at such
a stage of efficiency that they could carry
> on under the protection afforded by
exchange.” There is no doubt as to the
efficiency, but the rest of the statement
will be questioned, especially by those
who have to face Asiatic competition.
Neither will they be satisfied with the
assurance that “if it can be shown that
unemployment will be created by the
changes in any industry, that industry
will again receive early attention by the
Tariff Board.”
The real effect of these tariff changes
will reveal itself only after they have
been in operation some time. Local
makers of motor-car parts talk of diffi-
culties ahead of them. Main increases
in our imports during recent months,
which show signs of becoming embar-
rassing, have been in respect of cotton
goods, machinery, iron and steel, and
motor chassis. Imports of tea, tinned
sheet-iron, talkie films arid fertilisers fell
away.
The importance of wool in our over-
seas trade position is shown by latest
export statistics. At £7,516,000 (slg.) our
shipments of the staple for the four
months were worth little more than half
those of the corresponding 1933 period.
Dried fruits, hide and lead exports were
all down. Beef and mutton, sugar and
wine showed increases.

"Cleopatra”
A typical De Mille at Sydney St.
James. Caesar (Warren William) is a
handsome young stalwart with a full head
of hair at the time of the assassination.
Cleopatra (Claudette Colbert) doesn’t age
between her first meeting with Caesar and
Actium, and she registers allure on the
same old Folies Bergeres lines. C.
Aubrey Smith is one of those bluff old
warriors who always figure in such plays ;
he stands out by reason of his magnifi-
cent presence and voice. Joseph Schild-
kraut is conventionally wily as the
queen’s adviser. Henry Wilcoxon pro-
vides the only intelligent character study.
Anthony, by all accounts, was very like
the man the English actor portrays—
brave, violent, an illiterate vulgarian and
a greedy sensualist. But his realism seems
as out of place among so many Holly-
wood stereotypes as Laughton’s did in
“Henry the Eighth.”
However, the spectacle’s the thing. The
early shots resemble a succession of pic-
tures by Alma Tadema ; as the action
proceeds the characters become dressier,
the interiors more rococo. Cleopatra
drips pearls the size of pigeons’ eggs,
displays a train like a giant’s bedspread.
There is a triumph, with Ctesar fatuously
complacent in a chariot. His behavior
would seem incredible in a master of
Rome if we hadn’t just seen the Duce
posturing in a gazette.
Then come the battle scenes. Men
cleave one another to the earth;
anguished, bleeding faces are seen in
huge close-ups; the cavalry dash into
action. A few minutes later we are
watching a naval battle with ships crash-
ing into one another, fireballs flying,
masts blazing and toppling. As a spec-
tacle there has been nothing like it for
extravagant imaginativeness on a screen.
Anthony’s protracted death-scene
comes as something of an anti-climax.
Present critic would recommend an un-
obtrusive retreat, where practicable,
after Anthony falls upon his sword.
“The Count of Monte Cristo”
There can be only one serious objec-
tion to this version of Dumas’s novel,
which was pre-shown last week by
United Artists at Sydney Western Elec-
tric theatrette ; it is too much' of a good
thing. Almost every character in the
book is brought in, and the chief events
Jackie Cooper in “Treasure Island,”
coming to Sydney St. James.
are treated with merciless thoroughness.
We first see Dantes (Robert Donat) as a
carefree sailor boy. He is given the fatal
letter in the midst of a raging movie
storm ; is met at Marseilles by Mercedes
(Elissa Landi) ; wins her consent to their
wedding ; is undone by villains and re-
moved to the Chateau d’lf.
Every step of his prison life, from his
reception by the sleepy Governor to his
escape, is followed by the camera. The
same with his expedition in search of
the abbe’s treasure and his revenges. It
is all representationally Gallic till we
reach the sensational climax —an Ameri-
canised Court scene. After that the happy
ending, with Edmond and Mercedes
nestling in each other’s arms amid the
branches of a tree —a procedure which'
looks perfectly natural since neither of
them appears to be a day older than
when their troubles began.
It’s frank melodrama, and the acting
is in keeping. Plays of the kind used to
be staged at Drury Lane early in the
century, but the casting wasn’t so good,
and they were not nearly so spectacular.
“Hawaiian Nights”
Four “well-known Hollywood authors”
and six equally illustrious composers
formed a brain trust to manufacture this
talkie, and plumped for the mildly Gil-
bertian notion of a yacht on which
Guy Kibbee in “Wonder Bar,” at
Sydney Plaza.
America’s new-rich are ministered to by
America’s new-poor. There doesn’t seem
to be much difference between the
classes. The whole gang gets stranded on
a Polynesian islet whose queen (mentally
unsound) is Mary Boland. She decides
to have all hands massacred unless Sid-
ney Blackmer marries her, and she has
the yacht sown with time-bombs. Even-
tually the passengers and crew decide to
remain for ever on the island, where, as
one of the “hits” of the opus announces,
there is “nothing else to do but love.”
Exhibitions of nudity promised in
posters and dope-sheets would seem to
have been ordered off the screen by our
literary beach-inspectors, and little else
of interest remains save the arias penned
by Hollywood’s six leading Schuberts.
Only one of these has a claim to endur-
ing fame. It has been composed on a
three-note scale, and should find a place
in Percy Grainger’s collection. At .Syd-
ney Capitol.
“Side Streets”
Title seems an effort to cash in on
“Main Street” and “Back Street,” but the
wine needs no bush. The side-street
dweller is Aline MacMahon. She sells
furs, and what she doesn’t know about
her trade wouldn’t fill the pelt of a white
mouse. She falls for Paul Kelly, a sea-
faring roughneck some years younger
than herself, and marries him in haste.
The rest is repentance. When the baby
boy comes Paul steadies, but the kiddie
dies ; and Paul runs away with Aline’s
niece.
There are two touches in the grey story
that flout melodramatic convention. Aline
dresses herself up in the latest fashion to
win her man back, but he doesn’t give
her finery a glance. And when he is
rummaging in the attic for a suitcase
before eloping he comes on the baby’s
things which Aline has stowed away there
—and goes right on eloping. Miss Mac-
Mahon’s characterisation has life in every
line. Also at the Capitol.
“Wonder Bar”
At Sydney Plaza. Its main fault is
that it’s a one-man show. A 1 Jolson
is the proprietor of Wonder Bar, a night
club in Paris which is haunted by
wealthy Americans. And it is practical^
all Jolson, though the ballets are elabor-
ate and the chorines lovely and numer-
ous. Dolores Del Rio, Ricardo Cortez,
Kay Francis (with very little to do) and
Dick Powell help it along, and there
are others with names equally well
known.
“Desirable”
A 19-year-old schoolgirl bursts upon
New York society as the daughter of a
famous actress. Within a couple of
weeks she experiences all the thrills and
heartaches which the average young lady
meets with in as many years, and at the
finish she’s in the arms (it’s in an eleva-
tor) of the charming young man who had
been her mother’s most ardent admirer.
Jean Muir fills the part of the trans-
planted schoolgirl convincingly, and
George Brent, as the charming young
man, and Verree Teasdale, as the mother,
do well with less pliable material. Also
at the Plaza.
“Waltzes from Vienna”
Not nearly so satisfactory as the stage
version which was seen in Australia a
year or so ago. Edmund Gwenn and
Esmond Knight, as Strauss the elder and
younger respectively, are adequate, and
Fay Compton passes muster as the Coun-
tess, but Jessie Matthews’s startled eyes
don’t suit Resi. There’s quite a Disney
touch about the scene in which “Schani”
Strauss is being shown through the
pastrycook’s establishment and the
dough-mixing machine, fancy cakes and
bread rolls keep time with the melody
running through his brain.
Some First Nights
“Let’s Go Dancing,” a revue in 26
scenes, staged at Sydney Cri. in aid of
various charities, is mostly a dancing
show. The hoofers —there are about a
hundred of them—hail from the Richard
White Dancing Academy and range from
children to polished adults. Jocelyn
Yeo deserved the applause which fol-
lowed the performance of the delightful
ballets which were arranged by her, and
Patricia and Colin are a pair of adagio
dancers of quality. In “Little Mister
Baggy Britches,” a turn done in Dutch
costumes, Jackie and Esme Bolger
brought the house down. Vernon Sellars
and Queenie Ashton are the prin-
cipal songsters, and Renie Riano, Joy
Morris, Wally Bent, Don Julian, John
Rybak and Phillip Lewis keep the funny
parts going. For an assemblage which
has not had a great deal of stage experi-
ence the Richard White co. gave a re-
markably good account of itself.

Percy Grainger believes that music
escaped the evolutionary process. In all
ages, in all countries, it is a perfect
medium of expression. It develops, but
not by getting “better” ; rather by be-
coming “freer” —freed of conventions, of
arbitrary scales, tonalities and intervals,
always striving to achieve the spontaneity
Hugh Herbert in “Wonder Bar.”
of the bird call and the other voices of
nature. He developed this line of thought
in the first of his broadcast lectures from
Sydney last week on “The Universalist
Attitude Towards Music,” using gramo-
phone records of a vocal duet with Javan-
ese gong-orchestra accompaniment; of
Oriental temple bells; of Madagascans
and Rarotongans singing part-songs and
of recent jazz compositions. Singers
and instrumentalists in the studio aided
the lecturer by performances of an
exotic trio, Lineva’s “Kindling Wood”;
Curtiss-Burling’s eight-voice negro lul-
laby ; excerpts from Fichenser’s Seventh
Quintet, part-writing for strings by
Wallace Beery in “Treasure Island.”
Purcell and Bach (the last the original
quartet arrangement of the “Air for
G String”). Whatever else may be said
about the exposition it brought before
the speaker’s invisible audience a wider
range of musical expression, chronologi-
cally, geographically and in all other
ways, than most of them had dreamt of.
Weirdest example of the lot was the
Rarotongan choral outburst, but the
record, made by an amateur in the first
instance, is very old and worn, and
needle-scratch and voices competed for
supremacy on level terms.
# # #
Two pianos discoursed from the
stage of Sydney Con. hall one night last
week, the performers being Frank
Hutchens and Lindley Evans. Scarlatti
would have been astonished to hear one
of his thin little clavichord suites de-
livered with organ-like sonority, and
Papa Haydn, listening to his divertimento
for brasses as variationed by Brahms,
should have been delighted. Saint Saens
and Arensky figured on the programme
together with Arnold Bax and other
moderns. Evidently the volume of two-
piano literature is rapidly increasing.
* * *
Highlights of the orchestral concert
at Sydney Con. hall were the perform-
ances of two Delius numbers—“ Sea
Drift,” with the voices, and “Dance-
Rhapsody.” Both were worthily pre-
sented, and gave emphasis to Grainger’s
claim that in modem times England
stands pre-eminent in music. The pro-
gramme, which commenced with the
funeral march from the “Eroica,” as a
tribute to Verbrugghen, was broadcast'
from a national station, and proved to
be quite the best orchestral transmission
yet achieved in these parts.
* * *
No difficulty whatever was experi-
enced in listening to the performance of
Elgar’s “Dream of Gerontius,” which
was the final item of the centenary song
festival at Melbourne Town Hall. The
music is simple and melodious, the play-
ing of the Symphony Orchestra' under
Bernard Heinze was excellent, and the
solo singing, especially that of tenor
Walter Widdop, lent for the occasion by
the Fuller management, more than ade-
quate ; moreover, in this opus Elgar
gives the singers a squarer deal than most
composers of oratorio. The production
should have attracted a larger audi-
ence ; but for some reason or other
centenary fixtures are beginning to be
looked on with suspicion by the general
public, which tends to return to its old
amusement haunts with a sad lack of
civic patriotism.
Although it deals with one of the most
tragic situations imaginable—the death
of a doubting soul and its confrontation
with the eternal mysteries—“ The Dream”
is surprisingly gentle. It takes you to an
after-world that is no more alarming than
a traffic court, and where even the
demons are well-behaved. Elgar’s orches-
tration is masterly, and the work is full of
lovely melodies and effective devices.
Isabel Biddell and Newstead Rush were
heard to better advantage than at the pre-
vious concerts, and the chorus was as
well disciplined as a ducal police escort.


SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Pastoralist Jack Leahy gave the book-
makers a nice Christmas-box when
Winawin, a brother to Pentheus, scored
in the Camden Handicap at Warwick
Farm. He went out at 33 to 1, and got
a lucky run on the rails when the leader,
Charalf, tired at the Leger. Winawin
went on to beat Wee Jock by a head,
with the favorite, High, a head away.
High should have won. Badly away
from the barrier —an unpleasant change,
for he is usually a smart beginner—he
was last at the half-mile and only ahead
of three turning for home. Taken to the
outside, he galloped very fast over the
last furlong. It was a good trial for the
Villiers Stakes, in which High has
7st. 31b.
V.R.C. chairman L. K. S. Mackinnon
has a good colt in Strathardale (2 to 1),
who won the Kirkham Stakes in smash-
ing style. Slow away, he soon moved
into a nice position on the rails behind
Wise Boy and Shirrob, and immediately
Pratt asked him to do his best he passed
them. Wise Boy and Silver Rose fol-
lowed him to the box, the last-named
cutting out Medallist for third prize.
Strathardale has had a fair amount of
racing and looks on the light side. All
the same, he will make Homer gallop in
the December Stakes.
Darby Munro, on Magnitas (9 to 4),
was suited by the solid pace set by Bill
Wedgewood in the December Handicap.
Bill streaked away from the barrier and

set up a six-lengths’ lead. He tired when
Mr. Kerry, who had been chasing him,
drew level at the turn ; Mr. Kerry in his
turn could not withstand the last run of
Magnitas, who scored convincingly, with
lolaus a good third. Magnitas has Bst.
21b. in the Summer Cup. Lavington,
tailed off early, came home well, and is
a Summer Cup possibility with 6st. 121 b.
Miss Whitty, backed for the Farm
Novice from twelves to sevens, improved
greatly on her run at Moorefield, where
she was favorite. Pratt, previously suc-
cessful on Cereza and Strathardale, shot
the Whittier mare away in the straight,
to beat Hot Stuff by 2| lengths ; Morse,
after leading for home, could only run
third. The favorite, Bulldozer, a stable-
mate of Journal, had the run of the race,
but dropped out in the last furlong.
A.J.C. committeeman Hunter White
and E. J. Watt had their colors carried
to victory in divisions of the Maiden
Nursery—by One More and Cereza.
One More (7 to 1), a Tippler colt bred
by Hunter White, was all out to beat
Flamari and Gibson, but Cereza (7 to 1)
was untroubled. She is by Heroic —Rhea.
Demagogue (Windbag—Lipstick), owned
by A. G. Hunter and Percy Miller, was
backed down to 9 to 4 in Cereza’s race.
He is not quite ready, and could only
finish third. Cablegram did well to run
fourth after being cut off at the start.
* * * *
Villius, a Gay Lothario colt, trained
by J. G. Heywood for F. E. Cobbold,
a Queensland pastoralist, has been a
friend to McShortodds ever since he
commenced racing in Melbourne. He
won at 25 to 1 last season, at the same
price on Oaks Day, and at 12 to 1 in
the Laluma Handicap at Moonee Valley
on Saturday. It was the chief event of
the afternoon.
Time was when C. T. Godby had a
rainbow round his shoulder as an owner-
trainer. Now his successes on the turf
are few and far between. Cecil went
for a killing on Excelic in the Laluma
Handicap. The Heroic gelding did not
gallop satisfactorily for Dempsey, and
was beaten three furlongs from home,
up to which stage he had raced promi-
nently. Villius drew away from his rivals
at the straight entrance and scored hand-
somely. His owner lives mostly in Mel-
bourne, but also races in Queensland,
and Villius may find his way north later
on.
Two Maoriland-bred horses were suc-
cessful, Chenars (by Hunting Song) tak-
ing the first division of the Argyle High-
weight and Bunsby Gaze (by Captain
Bunsby) the Koombahla Trial. The
first-named galloper is trained by Claude
Goodfellow, who races him in conjunc-
tion with “Les Hilton,” his chief patron.
Bunsby Gaze belongs to two Bendigo
men, J. H. Lienhop and W. Crowley.
The best price obtainable about, Chenars
was even money, but he had not much
to spare, Airkloof finishing only a neck
away. Bunsby Gaze was well backed at
5 to 1 ; he, too, scored by a narrow
margin, Sannottar putting up a great
struggle. Without doubt the favorite,
Melisande, should have won. Last at the
five furlongs in a journey of one mile
44 furlongs he did exceptionally well to
run third. The time, 2min. was
l|sec. faster than that set up by Nightly
in the Moonee Valley Cup; but the
going was heavy that day.
L. J. Hynes gave a delightful exhibi-
tion of horsemanship in winning the Kal-
kallo Trial Hurdle on Hazward, the
favorite. Hynes steadied down his mount
after going to the front, and in his cap-
able hands Hazward jumped better than
any of the other contestants. The favor-
ite had sufficient in reserve to stall off a
late challenge from Lanour, who beat
him when they previously met at Ascot.
Several jumpers were in evidence in
open company. Baanya —who is to be
spelled at last —ran fourth in the Laluma
Handicap. Phocis, perhaps the best two-
miler over hurdles in Victoria, had an
outing in the first division of the Argyle
Highweight Handicap ; he is above him-
self in condition. Poitreux lost third
place in the Koombahla Trial by the pro-
verbial eyebrow. He did much better
than L. K. S. Mackinnon’s steeplechaser
Pactolus, who was preferred to him in
the betting.
Lady Treasure, a stable-companion of
Baanya, demonstrated that Tasmanian
galloping form cannot be ignored. She
outstayed Nellie Thrice in the second
division of the Argyle Highweight Han-
dicap. The rather ancient Byron was
favorite for this event, but had a bad
spin and came home in the rear division.
The easiest win of the afternoon was
that achieved by Theresa Gamba in the
Juvenile Handicap. This little daughter
of Manfred never gave the opposition a
look-in, but the stable could have pro-
fited little over the result, as bookmakers
demanded 2 to 1.
(Continued on page 61.)
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Sonnenberg was far too speedy and
strong for Ali Bey at Sydney Stadium
on Thursday, though he fell an easy vic-
tim to a body-press that evened the falls.
Bey was disqualified in the fifth
for slinging his foe over the ropes. The
Tom Lurich-Haban Singh “Australian
championship” at Leichhardt got rather
raw at times. The Russian scored the
deciding fall. The winners of these
matches are to meet at the Stadium to-
morrow night. Stern-faced policemen
will be on hand to see they don’t tear
one another to pieces.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Styme”: About the most meritorious
effort of The Lakes Club open was that
of Jim Ferrier, the Manly boy. Of
course, an American won —it was Craig
Wood this time. Craig Wood’s perform-
ance was phenomenal. His 283 equalled
our open-championship record; he
shot a 67 (two better than the original
Lakes record) on the last round ; and a
74 on Friday afternoon was his worst.
Ferrier’s triumph consisted in finishing
behind seven of the visitors and a couple
of strokes in front of Thomson. He
stood out from all the other Australian
amateurs and pros., and with a spot of
luck on the greens he might have been
very near the leaders. If Australia has
a champion in the making it is almost
certainly this long-hitting, sunny-tem-
pered young giant.
* * * *
“Dynamite”: The famous 16th at The
Lakes had most of the competitors in
the open championship puzzled. It is a
teaser from whatever angle you approach
it. A dog-leg by rights, the wary per-
former who decides to let glory slide
and make the green in two is always
liable to get behind the peninsula of
sand and scrub that juts into the narrow
fairway ; and in that case anything may
happen. Last month a long-driving
American went for the gloves and
reached the green in one—a record. To
get on or near the 16th green in one a
couple of hundred yards of water have
to be negotiated; the tee is set well
back from the lake and there’s a tallish
bank on the clubhouse side. Say a 275-
yard drive, and it is liable in summer
to be into the teeth of a howling nor’-
easter.
* * . * . . *
• The visiting American
pros. differ from a good many of ours in
more things than a genius for exploding
from bunkers and sinking 20-iooters.
Most of them are first-class after-dinner
speakers ; nearly all can tell amusing
yarns amusingly ; and at least two are
w riter s. By writers I mean that they
have the rare gift of being able io pu
their voices and personalities on paper.
Pf os ‘ ar ? not encouraged to cu i-
vate the social graces , an e e er
he clubs that employ them the more
they are—as Comrade Bolsh might say
—ground down. The Americans are the
antithesis of what practically all golf
pros, are in Britain, namely, domestic
servants. Except that they play, dress and
keep their tempers better they might be
members of one of our leading clubs.
“Solander”: Before he departed from
Maoriland, Sarazen put up a record
which will take some beating ; he went
all the way down to The Bluff, and from
somewhere in the neighborhood dis-
patched a ball on a course of 180 degrees.
He now claims that he has driven a ball
further south than any American profes-
sional. But there is opportunity for
Thomson, Diegel or one of their mates
to better that. He can take the steamer
to the southernmost point of Stewart
Island and set up new figures.
* * * *
“No. 7”: There has been much smug
reprobation in our best golfing circles
of American methods of putting an ad-
versary off his game. Sarazen cited a
few in one of his articles. But some
dodges which are accepted as legitimate
here and in England are more discon-
certing than any number of wisecracks.
Dead slow play, for example. I saw an
amateur championship won in Britain by
a Scot whose principal asset was the
capacity to take up to 20 minutes study-
ing a shot. A few players of this type
are to be found on most links, and that
they are suffered to go on living is a
tribute to the self-restraint for which'
golfers are renowned. I had some speci-
mens in front of me the other Sunday
on one of those ragtime surf side courses
where you pay your money and take
what comes to you in the way of breaches
of the decencies. They not only loitered
on the fairways and held colloquies on the
greens ; they sat smoking and talking at
each tee, and only hit off as my partner
and I came up. But I think even these
pests were preferable to a home-bound
threesome on a similar class of links who
once advanced 1 on my game down the
middle of the fairway smacking their
balls powerfully in the wrong direction!
* * * *
“Divot Digger”: The statement that
golf is “less perilous than ping-pong and
twice as healthy” (B. 21/11/ ’34) is very
wide of the mark. The game can boast
a big annual casualty list which includes
many fatalities. A blow from a golf
ball is the cause of most of them—there
have been two or three recent cases in
Australia, one in N.S.W. and another in
Queensland. Next in order come casual-
ties due to a blow from a club, an extra-
ordinary number of folk who should
know better permitting themselves to
come within range of an iron or wood at
the end of the swing. Flying clubheads,
detached after taking too heavy a divot,
have also accounted for many serious
injuries. Further, of all games, golf is
the most dangerous for elderly people
with heart trouble. A very short bout
at tennis, say, gives such a one emphatic
warning. Golf with its apparently leisure-
liness —it is really a most fatiguing game
•—kids the sufferer along until he drops
in his tracks. We had a very notable
example of this at Royal Sydney a
couple of seasons ago.
* * * *
“Carnoustie”: Jock McLean (B.
28 /11 / ’34) was the central figure early
this year in one of the most extra-
ordinary happenings in the history of
golf. In the final of the British ama-
teur championship his opponent was an
“artisan” golfer from Glasgow. A huge
crowd of Clydesiders turned out for
the match, and when it looked as if
McLean would beat their man they pro-
ceeded to give him the rough stuff. Be-
fore and after every stroke he was jeered
at, and in the closing stages he was
so crowded that often he had to wait
until room for his swing was cleared.
His opponent won —and promptly turned
professional.

are Whittingham (Bst. 81b.), Australia
Fair (Bst. 51b.), Roman Spear (Bst. 31b.),
Care Free (Bst.) and Buonarroti (7st. 91b.).
The last-named has evidently, improved,
but Closing Time looks the pick.
Brown Force has made a distinct im-
pression on Sydney racegoers. After a
fair performance in the Duke of Glou-
cester Plate he was second (to Wallace
Mimi, a consistent fellow but an out- ,
sider) in the Ascot Cup, and he is now
one of the favorites for the Summer
Cup, in which he has Bst. 91b. Still, a
mile and five furlongs may be a little
further than he cares to go. He receives
21b. from Wallace Mimi (7st. 51b.) for a
beating of a length and a quarter at
Ascot. Satmoth, favorite for that race,
comes down from Bst. 111 b. to Bst. 41b.
Senior (Bst. 41b.), Braeburn (Bst. 31b.) and
Mr. Kerry (Bst. 31b.) are a warm trio.
Winooka has lOst. 51b. in the Car-
rington Stakes. Too much in his present
shape, but he continues to do well.

Selling shares in lottery tickets is about
the most flourishing occupation in N. S.
Wales. Alderman Donald Grant, who
goes to “the meetings” as regularly as he
spouts in the Domain, told the Leg.
Council the other day that one of the
pillars of the trade could be seen “putting
on £SO and £100,” and his capacity to
do this was no mystery ; “he makes Is. 9d.
on every ss. 3d. ticket he sells, and he
has sold 4000 in a day.” The Govern-
ment has vaguely undertaken to stop this
traffic “before Christmas.” It made the
same promise last year and the year
before.
Ins and Outs
“Five Ways”: The star turn of the
Queensland-S.A. Sheffield game in Bris-
bane won by the home side by three
wickets —was Hansen’s double, 147 and
60 n.o. The youngster’s best score in
Shield cricket previously was 59 against
Victoria in Brisbane last year, and his
form was so indifferent as to warrant
the selectors dropping him from the side
touring the south. This last performance
in Sheffield cricket brings his aggregate
to 509 and his average to a shade over
26. Hansen is a left-hander, and this
probably accounts for his success against
Grimmett, who is sometimes ineffective
against southpaws. For a batsman of
his type, Hansen is unusually strong on
offside shots.
* * * *
“Pagan”: Yet another country lad has
had to come to the bright lights to make
his cricket fortune. Robinson’s excep-
tional form with the bat in the New-
castle district received no official recog-
nition. Lately he has been translated to
the Gordon club in Sydney, and, their
attention having been thus called to his
existence, the Ma State selectors have
included him in the team for the south-
ern tour. The young fellow is (o fill
one of the numerous holes caused by
defections.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip”: McCabe is not to tour
with the N.S.W. XI ; the doctors have
warned him not to risk the hand broken
in the Woodford testimonial match,
There is a chance of his being able to
figure in the home matches at Sydney
at the end of the season ; meantime Old-
field is to skipper the team. He is a
good captain—vastly superior to Kippax
—but doesn’t care for the job.
* * * *
“Hotham”: Bitter experience is behind
Ponsford’s decision to leave big cricket

before it leaves him. When he first
began to fill the stage as a public hero
he had a life billet in the Victorian Sav-
ings Bank. A newspaper tempted him
away with a contract to act as its cricket
expert; then came temporary loss of form
and eclipse by the rising of anew star,
and the contract was not renewed. The
M.C.C. came to the rescue with a job in
its office, which Ponsford still holds.
When he was chosen for the last Aus-
tralian team thousands of quondam ad-
mirers cursed their gods that such an
iniquity should have been permitted.
Ponsford’s success on the tour astonished
his best friends, and gave him a chance
to get out of a thankless occupation in a
blaze of glory.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Baffy”: The Lakes, where the visit-
ing American pros, made their farewell
appearances on Friday and Saturday, is
the baby of Sydney’s great golf course
family. George Solomon concluded five
years ago that the area which was the
source of early Sydney’s water supply
would make another Sandwich, and he
proved to be right. The Lakes is prob-
ably the most sporting and difficult
course in N. S. Wales. Its clubhouse,
which sits solidly down on a hill looking
west over the first hole to the right and
the eighteenth to the left, is an archi-
tectural gem ; but the approach from the
back isn’t nearly so attractive. A. W.
East, the pro., was repatriated from
America shortly after the club got going.
* • * * *
“Melb.”: The defeat of the British
amateurs at Kingston Heath satisfied
Victorians that, with the exception of
McLean (who beat Ryan 3 and 1 in the
singles, and with Scott beat Whitton and
Ryan 3 and 2 in the foursomes), the tour-
ists are not class players. They do what
Sarazen said our best amateurs are guilty
of (mix appalling shots with good ones),
and they do it often. Scott is an artist
till he tires, but he seems to tire fairly
quickly these days. McLean is an artist
all the time ; he has every shot in the
bag and he produces them consistently,
Australia hasn’t an amateur to touch
him, day in, day out.
* * * *
“Miami”: One result of the American
golfers’ visit may be a return call from
a team of Australian professionals. As
Tom Howard, president of the A.P.G.A.,
said in Melbourne, our men could com-
pete in the winter tournaments held in
the southern States and California. That
would be during the slack Australian
summer season when pros, could be
spared. Such a tour would do more
than anything else to raise the standard
of Australian golf, both professional and
amateur.
* * * *
“Sandwich”: “Hoylake” himself slips
when he says (B. 5/12/ 34) that Joyce
Wethered now ranks as a professional,
She did become one, as stated, but the
whitewash brush seems to have been
busy. Newspaper files from England
show that the lady took part in a mixed
foursomes at Worpledon, which she
only have done as an amateur,
and Enid Wilson were beaten in the
urst round.
* _ * . *
Divot Digger : In a parting message,
Sarazen stressed a point on which Bul-
LETIN writers have olten dwelt the easy
mature of most of the Australian courses
compared with those overseas. That
fact is, of course, one of the reasons lor
the lower standard of our goll. In all
field games the man who plays under
easy conditions invariably shows it in his
game when faced with sterner stuff.
There are few courses in Australia up to
the standard of the American or British
championship links,
* * * *
“Ibn el Issar”: Australia is not the
only place afflicted with crows which steal
golf balls (B. 21/11 /’34). A bitter com-
plaint comes to hand from Ootamacund
in southern India that stealing by crows
has become so common that the club
committee has had to alter the rules.
Formerly a happening of the kind was
treated as a rub of the green, but this
has proved such a handicap for players
that a dropped ball without penalty is
now allowed. There is more than a
grave suspicion that the habit of the
Indian crows has been transmitted from
Australia —perhaps by stowaway crows
from these parts. It is significant that
the G.H.Q. of Ootamacund crowdom is
in a big plantation of Australian blue-
gums in the middle of the golf links.
* * * *
“Dammyt”: The women golfers of
N. S. Wales, in an attempt to demon-
strate the practicability of summer golf,
have organised an open event at Long
Reef for January 11. It isn’t a fair test.
The curse of summer golf in and around
Sydney is not the heat, but the flies.
They make the up-the-line, mountain and
country courses virtually unplayable be-
tween the end of November and the be-
ginning of April or thereabouts. There
are no flies on Long Reef as a rule. It
is practically in the sea, and wide open
to every breeze. If there’s a nor’-easter
on January 11 (and the odds on are
about ten to one) the L.G.U. players
won’t see a fly to the acre. Were they
to compete at, say, Dee Why, a mile or
so inland, they would have to spray one
another with anti-fly concoctions before
every shot.
Racquet and Bawl
“Fitzcray”: When the grounds at Koo-
yong were 20 feet under water the Vic.
tennis heads reluctantly transferred their
.inter-State matches to the Albert ground
courts. Curious that tennis folk seem
to pick on swamp sites for their courts.
Sydney’s White City is one example, and
the Milton ground in Brisbane is an-
other. Milton was always good for
soundings of 10 fathoms or so in any
ordinary Brisbane flocxl. In the engulf-
ment of 1893 the lead couldn’t find bot-
tom there.
More reversals of form! Crawford
lost to Turnbull 6-4, 3-6, 3-6, and young
Bromwich downed Hopman in straight
sets. Next day Turnbull was beaten by
Bromwich, also in straight sets, and Quist
by Crawford ; on the first day Quist had
flattened out Bromwich, 6-3, 6-0. Still,
the boy did wonderfully well. He is only
16. “Best lad of his age in the world,”
says Jack Clemenger. N. S. Wales finished
on top, two sets ahead of Vic., with South
Australia another set lower down.
* * * * .
“Brass Addler”: Takings on the final
day of the N.S.W. championships at
Rushcutter Bay amounted to £1625.
Gates for the whole tourney yielded
£3438. Out of this expenses have to
come, and the Australian body will take
£ll7O for its cut, but there will be a nice
little bit left for the old sock. Nothing
was wasted on entertaining the hard-
worked English girls, who were starved
for recreation and left for Melbourne
worn out, and seats supposed to be for
the press were sold to or grabbed by
the public. For “canniness” the
N.S.W.L.T.A. is in a class of its own.
* iit * *
“Cut Shot”: The victory of Vines in
the professional tennis tourney at South-
port suggests that the amiable young
Yank has recovered his form of a couple
of years ago. Vines has no regrets at
leaving the ranks of the alleged lily-
whites ; in less than a year he has cleared
close on 100,000 dahlars, and that with-
out the embarrassing necessity for con-
cealing the fact that there is money in
the game.
* * * *
“Cash Amateur”: Several cats have
been released from the bag by prominent
tennis amateurs. Austin has announced
that the old ideas of amateurism must go
into the discard ; with the intensification
of world-wide championships no one not
of independent means can possibly play
first-class tennis without being paid for
it. On top of that, Hughes, speaking his
piece in Sydney, says amateurism in first-
class tennis is not only impossible but has
ceased to exist. As it is, the big player
worth thousands in gate-money to tourna-
ment promoters can do what he dashed
well likes in the matter of demanding
and taking his “dash” for playing. Only
the small man, discovered pocketing a
surreptitious tenner for “appearance
money,” is ever jumped on. Both Eng-
lishmen urge the mingling of profes-
sional and amateur in tennis as in golf.
It seems the only sane solution.
Miscellaneous
“Queens”: Cambridge gave Oxford
an unholy licking in their athletic relay
meeting, winning six events to one, and
in that, the 880 low hurdles, the Light
Blue lad finished first, only to be dis-
qualified. Australia was represented in
both teams, Horsfall and Luxton, of
Melbourne, turning out for Cambridge,
and Baillieu, also a Yarrasider, teaming
up with Mclntyre, of Tassie, in the Dark
Blue array.
* * * *
‘The Gaffer”: Eddie Tolan, the Ameri-
can colored sprinter, now a professional,
has arrived in Melbourne, where he will
meet Austin Robertson and an alleged
Scottish champion hight Macfarlane in
a sprint series. Tolan is more muscular
and nuggety than the average sprinter,
but has shown in pipe-openers that he can
move, his work out of the holes being a
revelation. No Australian runner of late
years has approached the times he is
credited with. His last wins as an ama-
teur at Los Angeles Olympiad saw him
clocked to cover the 100 metres in
10 3-10 sec. and the 200 in 21 l-ssec.
Neither Robertson nor the Scottish visitor
can boast any performances coming
within yards of those.
* * * *
“Nindy Gully”: It isn’t often that the
third man in a Sheffield handicap is
placed fourth. A distrusted correspon-
dent writes that this happened at a
south-western Queensland pub meeting
on Melbourne Cup day. The final was
run pretty late, and all parties, especially
the officials, would have had a poor
chance of being admitted to the Order
cf Rechabites. My informant was
trainer of the third man, and, clad in
singlet and shorts, ran alongside him —
off the track, of course —by way of en-
couragement. In the excitement he
didn’t notice that he had finished in
front of his man and was flabbergasted
when he was given third money. Ex-
planations were useless, and the end of
a perfect day came with a free-for-all
scrap after my correspondent and his
principal had settled their dispute with a
private mill.

STORY-WRITING
BERNARD CRONIN
Those who wish to train for writing for
publication—stories, articles or paragraphs
—and are prepared to go through the
severe, if pleasant, discipline which pre-
cedes acceptance of MSS., are invited to
write to Mr. Bernard Cronin at 398

Mr. Cronin also gives frank and honest
criticism of MSS., and will be pleased to
correspond with writers who have had only
a limited success.
A WOMAN'S
LETTER
There was no line of parked cars
down the middle of Martin-place on
Friday ; in fact, the only cars that were
there were on a toy speedway, their
drivers three tiny monkeys, at once wist-
ful and mischievous, in absurd blue and
red coats. The speedway was the great
attraction of the place, which was set
about with awninged stall and chocolate
wheel in the interests of the Red Cross.
There was one stall run by public ser-
vants stocked from the Government’s
experimental farm. Pretty girls sold
buttons, and buyers who had meant to
get off with a sixpenny one this year
found themselves paying a shilling as
usual. Martin-place is full of memories,
and you can’t go back on the soldiers.
If you have been thinking rather com-
placently that all’s well with Australia,
you would have had an uncomfortable
half hour listening to J. B. Cramsie, of
the British Empire Settlers’ organisation.
He spoke to a meeting of representatives
of every woman’s society in Sydney, and
he told not only of the misery but of
the spirit of hopelessness that prevails in
unemployment camps. “Put them on
the land,” says Mr. Cramsie. Not on hap-
hazard chunks, but in community settle-
ments on suitable properties, not more
than 15 miles away from a railway. When
the dweller in the suburbs wants to buy
a home, if he produces £l5O the bank
will advance him another £lOOO and the
Government £lOO. Why not, asks Mr.
Cramsie, do the same for the land settler?
Looking around the circle that included
Housewives, National Councillors, Guilds
of Empire, Country Women, Catholic
Women and New Settlers, you could
almost see the stings of righteousness
being prepared for quick application.
Seven of those present were formed into
an advisory committee, its president
padre G. Cowie, its secretary Mrs.
Harold Weigall.
Cocktails chased away the gloom of
saying farewell when Lieutenant-Colonel
and Mrs. Ronald Scobie gave their last
party at the Victoria Barracks. The
Duntroon wing was the scene of action,
and about 60 guests clinked glasses with
the Scobies, who have become very popu-
lar during their two years’ stay in Syd-
ney. He is an officer of the Royal Engi-
neers, has been on loan to the Austra-
lian Military Forces and has been direc-
tor of military art at the R.M.C. Now
they return to London.
Mrs. Barton Dawkins is another whose
departure by the Orsova will leave a gap
in military circles. She, too, goes to Eng-
land, where she will join her husband,
Captain C. B. Dawkins, of the Austra-
lian Staff Corps. He commences a
two-year course at the Staff College,
Camberley, next year.
State Government House will soon
have new tenants. Already Lady Game’s
engagement-book is replete with fare-
well engagements. An idea struck by
a bright spark or two among Sydney’s
many welfare organisations, as well as
the Army and Navy circles, is to wipe
away the tear of farewell with the laugh-
ter of a theatrical garden party in Gov-
ernment House grounds. This will
happen almost before the Christmas pud-
ding is digested, a day or two before the
vice-regals depart. The District and the
Bush Nurses, two great favorites of Lady
Game’s, will benefit.
After the preliminary meeting last
Friday Mrs. A. C. Godhard served a
lunch of some dimensions. This kicked
off with curried prawns (soup doesn’t
count), evidently designed to make genius
burn, for everybody present was asked
to hand out a brilliant suggestion. Most
of the brains present didn’t seem to be
brilling, though the catch of suggestions
was heavy. Time to let the mental
powers simmer was besought. Sylvia
Welling, very trig at the top table, added
her quota; so did Mayoress Parker,
Jeanie Ranken, Ben Fuller’s lady and
Mrs. Harold Bowden.
Rosalie Wilson, whose articles the
women of Australia have been reading
in the “Woman’s Mirror” for some years,
has brought out a book on her subject.
“Practical Embroidery” is its* title, and
chapter by chapter the craftswoman is led
from satin stitch to the grandeur of
relief work in gold embroidery. The
style is clear and lucid, as only an expert
in the art could make it. The author
boasts a most impressive list of certifi-
cates ; some of them bear the seal of the
City and Guilds of London Institute ;
and she has been admitted to the Wor-
shipful Company of Broderers. The little
book carries a foreword by Florence Sul-
man, president of the Arts and Crafts
Society, and is illustrated with 104 draw-
ings by Rosalie.
Anne Gordon is one of Sydney’s most
popular young things. She goes every-
where, does everything, and, of course,
she danced with the Duke. But on one
day of the week Anne doesn’t frivol;
every Monday she gives to helping in the
Golden Fleece free kindergarten. Prob-
ably she enjoys this as much as anything,
and no doubt it helps her interpretation
of Peter Pan. She was Peter last year,
and will be Peter again this year in the
Independents’ production of this Christ-
mas evergreen. Anne is the daughter of
the knightly Alexander Gordons.
Dunvegan, the house above Mosman
Bay where for years William Macleod of
The Bulletin dispensed warm hospi-
tality, where on a satin-smooth bowling
green he held his Sunday-morning bowling
parties, of which “Hop” was an active
member, and at which Jimmy Edmonds
and S. H. Prior were occasional and
twinkling-eyed lookers-on, is passing into
the hands of strangers. Macleod and his
bride Conor O'Brien are dead, and Dun-
vegan, left bare by an auction sale, is to
be sold. From the walls of the billiard-
room the portraits of the former master
and mistress looked down on auctioneer
and bidders as though thinking they were
strange guests in that room that had
given warm welcome to probably every
artist and writer in Australia —the just-
beginning as well as the famous. One
wonders over what mantel the carved
elephants will continue the unceasing
crossing of their ebony bridge, over what
Sunday supper-table the small bronze
Cupid will now throw the glow from his
rosy torch.
Sydney is mixing up a cocktail in
restaurants. Its name is the Manhattan,
and it will be open to dispense
refreshment for man and maid on
December 19. Bruce Dellit, of Memo-
rial fame, is designing alterations
and decorations. These are to be all
cream and gold. The band from Rex’s
in Melbourne is coming over to fling out
streamers of jazz from eight-thirty of one
evening till the small hours of the fol-
lowing morning. The Manhattan is
below the Trust building, and the door
is in Castlereagh-street.
At the City of Sydney’s invitation Ben
Fuller loosed his aviary in the rooms of
Mayoress Parker
one morning last
week. Treble and
bass, alto and
tenor shook the
iast of Melbourne’s
floodwaters from
their wings. Al-
though there was
no sun to preen in
(topcoats and cos-
tumes have been
the past ten days’
necessity) Ben
Fuller pointed to-
wards the New
Tivoli standing
high and dry as
proudly as ever
Noah pointed to
Ararat.
One thing the
ladies in the com-
pany are pleased
about is the fresh-
ness of the cos-
tumes. Rich, too,
they come from
the wardrobes of
New York’s Met-
ropolitan Opera
House, and had
made only one or
tw o appearances
before coming to
Australia. Though
they carry enough
weight to support
them in prima
donna roles, none
of the women is
over-rotund. It was
quite a relief to
discover that
human canaries
and nightingales need not be smoth-
ered in a ton or so of lard.
While speeches were being outpoured
—Con. Director Bainton, Roland Foster,
Alfred Hill, conductor Maurice d’Abra-
vanel and some others made them
—it was pleasant to note the cheerful
looks and millinery of Gwladys Garside,
Mrs. Hitchen and Muriel Brunskill.
Though, of course, weather means no-
thing to Miss Brunskill, since she comes
from England’s “Lake Country.”
Sophie Segaert, daughter of the Consul-
General of Belgium, will marry her Frazer
Coss, of Wollstonecraft, at St. Augus-
tine’s, Neutral Bay, this afternon at 5.45.
Dorothea Tobin was all smiles that
nearly were tears at the conclusion of her
“Cherrie Acres.” This was presented at
the Savoy by Doris Fitton and a group
of her Independents, and in spite of wind
and rain the theatre was nearly filled.
This is the playwright’s second effort',
and it runs sweetly to a long-foreseen
finale. Her first play was all medicine
and drama —a complete contrast. One
of the amusing things of the performance
was to watch Betty Higgins’s youth and
fresh looks trying to curb themselves
under the make-up of an old lady. Mrs.
Tobin looked attractive, and took her
praises modestly. She wore a frock of
black crepe covered with a white velvet
coat. Her flowers were Delysia-like in
their profusion. Doris Fitton made a
fleeting appearance, and was handsome
in royal-blue laces and flashing crystal
earpieces.
Elma Sandford Morgan has a unique
appointment. She is Director of Mater-
nal and Baby Welfare —the first woman
doctor to be given an executive
job in the Government service. Dr.
Morgan has been with the N.S.W. De-
partment of Public Health since 1929,
and has been assistant-director of her
present department for some years. She
is a Sydney graduate, and gained her
early experience in the Children’s and
Prince Alfred hospitals. In war years
she directed the Civil Hospital for
Women and Children in Bagdad. The
doctor has written some’ books on
mothercraft, and she specialises in ante-
natal treatment. She is rather better
equipped for the job than any male could
be, being a mother herself.
At least one woman in his audience
last week wished she was a child again
when she heard Bernard Heinze make
music so simple a thing. Memories of
wearisome half-hours spent sitting on a
cranked-up music-stool in rebellious
argument with dull exercises came per-
sistently while the pleasant fellow ex-
plained the making up of tunes, followed
with musical illustrations. A symphony
orchestra under his guidance was no
longer a blur of unintelligible sounds, for
he explained the position and function
of each instrument. Small girls and boys
sat tense with interest (every chair in the
Town Hall was taken) during the ex-
planations and the programme, and at
the end buzzed delightedly when a closer
inspection of the instruments was al-
lowed. These kiddies’ concerts are one
of the A.B.C.’s brightest ideas.
Oswald Cheeke, who arrived once again
in Australia a few days ago, has ideas on
publicity that should prove useful to the
Australian National Travel Association.
The traveller, who, although an Austra-
lian, has spent most of his life in Eng-
land, says that English people desiring a
six or eight months’ holiday are not likely
to be lured 12,000 miles by pictures of
flocks of sheep browsing on vasty land-
scapes. They are much more likely to
have their attention riveted by pictures
of yachting and boating on Sydney Har-
bor, of fashionably-dressed crowds watch-
ing the racing at Randwick or dancing
at the Australia, by the interiors o£ fine
churches and by evidence that our
cinemas are luxurious and up to date.
A few pictures of the Navy entertaining
on cruisers off Farm Cove wouldn’t come
amiss. Mr. Cheeke is emphatically of the
opinion that the players of the world

at the present rate of exchange) if they
knew they could have all the joys of
home in an almost perfect climate, and

Melbourne
Chatter
For the first time in their official
capacity the new Mayor and Mayoress of
Melbourne entertained aldermen, coun-
cillors and civic officers and their wives.
At The Jolly Roger guests discovered
boxes of chocolates upon the seats, and
Mrs. Wales received instead a presenta-
tion bouquet of deep-pink roses sent with
the good wishes of her friends Mrs.
Rolls and Florrie Green. Winifred Wales
sat with her fiance, Len Callaway. Cr.
Frank Beaurepaire’s wife wore a floral
frock with' white fur upon her black coat.
Cr. Carden’s better-half chose nectarine
taffeta, and Mrs. Colin Anderson sat
wrapped in white fur. Mrs. Mayer
brought her granddaughter, Miss Cole-
man. Afterwards in the dining-room
of the Windsor guests removed oysters
from their shells to the tune of a
popping of corks and a trio of musi-
cians who became so vigorously rhyth-
mical with the old story “A Bicycle
Built for Two” that they may have
known about the wedding anniversary.
Host and hostess sat with Alderman
William Brunton and his lady and the
Frank Stapleys. The speeches were brief,
a toast proposed by Alderman Stapley
and an acknowledgment from Mayor
Wales, who announced that the date of
his party was the first wedding anniver-
sary of knight Gengoult Smith and his
lady. There were claps for this couple,
who were discovered at the same table
as Harold Luxton and his lady. It was
altogether a very jolly party. As a finale
the Mayor directed the band to the
lounge, and everybody who was “young
enough or fit enough” to dance and be
merry.
“Girls playing cricket! Why don’t they
stay in their homes? Can’t they find
some other game to play? Lot of
dashed rot!” There were many detri-
mental comments passed by both men
and women before the first English
women’s cricket team to visit Australia
played a feminine Vic. team. The crowd,
of both sexes, turned up out of curiosity
and stayed to watch with intense interest.
Patronising remarks changed to admira-
tion, for the girls can play cricket.
Quite early on the first day the “outer”
had an opportunity to use its sense of
humor, for England’s first “man” out was
Snowball, bowled by Kettels. For Vic.,
the stalwart Nell McLarty’s first ball of
the innings was a boundary. The teams
are not particularly hefty and masculine-
looking. Many of the girls are small and
wiry, with sunburned skins and a
sprinkling of freckles. A few have long
hair and keep it tidy with nets.
Betty Archdale’s girls wear blouses
and short divided skirts of aertex, white
cotton stockings and white linen hats
if they don’t play bareheaded. The Vic.
lasses wear plain white dresses reaching
below their knees, suntan stockings and
white cricket caps. Both rigs have their
points, but the semi-shorts look more
comfortable and are more suitable when
worn with pads than are longer skirts.
There is an undercurrent of satisfaction
that the women did not invade the
M.C.C. in slacks or the bare legs and
brief tight shorts which are so fatal to
most feminine figures.
As a mark of appreciation for the work
done by the group leaders and members
of the committee of the International
Club Pageant, Mr. and Mrs. Herbert
Brookes gave an at-home in their honor
at Winwick. Host and hostess were
assisted by their daughter Jessie, whose
floral garment showed the new winding
scarf which is really a cape in disguise,
and by Mrs. M. R. McMillan in a black
velvet, fur-bordered wrap over lace.
Among the guests were Stella Palfrey
(she was an impressive Britannia in the
pageant), who pinned a large cameo
brooch among the knots of ermine on her
gown. Carmen Winter (who appeared
with the Belgian group) was in silver
lame, and Beryl McCann (who organised
the Irish colleens) wore gold metal tissue
scarcely paler than her fair hair. Present
also were Mr. and Mrs. Nicolades, she
with a bunch of tulips pinned to her
dress with the assistance of a little silver
crocodile ; the Rev. and Mrs. Law, she
in raisin-color threaded with gold ; Alfred
Bristowe, who brought his wife clad in
black with hailspot globules upon the
sleeves ; Christina Cheong and Mrs. H.
Berryman in a luxurious weave of
geranium and gold. Dr. and Mrs. Krizos
were there (he with a beard); also Lesley
Henderson, whose dress was awning-
striped in reds and blues upon a white
background. The evening’s spokeswomen
were Mrs. Brookes and Mrs. Claude
Couchman, who has lately returned from
Geneva.
Here is a Spencer Shier picture of Ellis,
elder daughter of Mr. and Mrs. George
Nicholson, of Hawthorn. Miss Nichol-
son has recently become engaged to
Albert Harold Faul. She is keen on all
sports, and she and her fiance include
ski-ing among their favorite pastimes.
The trousseau will be completed next
year.
Mr. and Mrs. David Robertson gave a
late-afternoon party as a good-bye to
Mrs. Jamie Woods, who returned to
Perth last week to meet her husband on
his arrival from Port Said. Mr. Woods
had bad luck in the air race, only getting
as far as Aleppo. At the party the hostess
looked like a diminutive Dresden china
figure in pansy-blue lace with her beauti-
ful white hair uncovered. Mrs. Woods
wore nettle-green crinkle crepe gathered
into a high halter neck. Later in the
evening there were bridge in the draw-
ing-room and smokeroom and dancing
in the billiard-room, where tall green
glasses and bottles disguised as fat little
men in red coats repeated the joyous
note sounded by masses of spring flowers.
Among the guests were Mr. and Mrs.
S. E. Gebbie, she in a blue dress and
coat'. Arthur Jacobs brought his wife
and her sister, Mrs. S. Levine, of Johan-
nesburg ; two distinctive figures, confus-
ingly alike in similar shades of pigeon-
grey lace. The Roy Andersons were
there, she in a dramatic little beret.
Among the American guests were the
Otto Schumachers, who must be among
Uncle Sam’s earliest settlers in Australia,
for they have lived here 40 years. Mrs.
H. P. Ogilvie wore blue with terraced
ornamentation around the neckline. Mar-
jorie Pearce was in beige with dark
wood-brown accessories at neck and
waist. In the study at Cresswell is a
photograph of Archibald of The Bulle-
tin, who was a cousin of Mrs. Robertson.
Mrs. Wallace Mitchell is the mother
of seven young Australians, but she
makes time to be a fairy godmother to
88 youngsters at the Orthopaedic Hos-
pital. Every year she sees that old Santa
Claus has a date at Frankston to coin-
cide with the hospital’s Christmas-tree.
Her party filled the Venetian court at
the Australia, whence came guests armed
with all manner of bulgy paper parcels
to drink tea, listen to a short address by
Mrs. Tom White and watch a film of
the hospital and its patients. Mrs. Mitchell
wore a long navy-blue cape and turned-
back satin hat. Mrs. Gordon Coulter car-
ried a speckled bag against her brown
dress. Mrs. Frank Spry accompanied Mrs.
Horace Spry, whose dusty-pink suit went
with a white hat and Arctic foxes. Joyce
Walker wore a string mesh cape over a
darker brown frock, and covered her
auburn head with one of the lofty Tyro-
lean hats which are expected next season
to annihilate the amusing little crownless
pancakes of to-day. Nola Purbrick’s hat
was large and black. White camellias
grew on Mrs. Harry Scott’s black tarn
and on the lapel of her coat.
Rev. George Stubbs, chaplain of Flin-
ders Naval Depot, waited at St. John’s,
Toorak, to put Commander and Mrs.
James Esdaile safely afloat in their mat-
rimonial sloop. Outside the church the
swords of the Navy formed an archway
for the newly-wedded pair. The dark-
eyed bride was Judy, elder daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Cecil Finch. She was
robed in opalescent satin and attended
by three small boys and two ’maids,
Denise Finch and Ainslie Williams. The
little lads, Pat and Rory Burnett and
Rod O’Connor, wore white sailor suits,
and into the deep-cream gowns worn by
the ’maids were woven golden coin cpots,
while cream and gold flowers wreathed
their hair and lay across their arms.
Toasts were honored at the home of
Judge and Mrs. Williams. The honey -
mooners have left for England, where
they will live for at least two years.
Wrapped in the deepest secrecy were
the matrimonial intentions of singer
Horace Stevens and Mrs. W. H. Hallam.
To the merest handful of friends was
whispered news of the event, its time and
place (Scots Church) and of a luncheon
at Menzies. The bride’s nutmeg gown
swung a fur-edged cape, while doses of
brown and pewter buttons and a spray
of orchids toned up the corsage. Mrs.
Stevens is a woman of ability. For
several years she has carried on a busi-
ness as a builder and contractor.
Father Christmas has been booked for
December 19 at Yooralla Hospital
School and Free Kindergarten, but
owing to the depressing condition of the
school’s balance-sheet he’s very worried
about the contents of his sack on that
date. The children are cripples (their
affliction has been caused in most cases
by infantile paralysis), and come from
very poor homes. The school is only
a few yards from the Children’s Hospital,
where the patients are taken regularly for
massage and other treatments. They
arrive every morning in the school’s
horse dray, those who can’t sit up rest-
ing in layers of sliding stretchers. Many
have to be bathed and put into clean
clothes. Poor, little Nellie, aged eight,
who hobbles about on irons, helps wash
up at home and looks after the two
youngest babies. Ron, a healthy lad of
seven, was suddenly attacked by the
poisonous “infantile” germ, and now he
must keep so perfectly flat that a glass
tray has been made for him. It swings
over his head and holds a book which
he reads through the glass. Dorothy,
who is clever with her hands, has a bone
disease which is steadily growing worse.
Yooralla badly wants more wheel-beds
(but the cost is £5 each) and a sun-
blind for the courtyard so that the child-
ren could lie outside without straining
their eyesight. But more than anything
it wants its 40 youngsters, whose ages
go up to 14, to have a toy each for
Christmas.
The girl wearing the cunning little
beret, the aim of which, as planned by its
Parisian creator, is the obliteration of
one eye, is Peggy, only daughter of Mrs.
E. Barnes. Miss Barnes returned to Mel-
bourne a few months ago after four
years spent abroad. She lived longer in
Paris than in London, for she found the
romantic studios of Montmartre excellent
stepping-off places for the pursuit of her
fashion designing. She draws skilfully,
and has a flair for clothes. On a trip to
America she met' Henry Malval, son of
Major Malval, of Dijon, France, with the
result that wedding bells will ring in the
U.S.A., where the couple will make their
home. Miss Barnes will wave good-bye
to Melbourne next year. Broothorn por-
trait.
As a result of the flooded Yarra,
boatsheds and several boats belonging
to Scotch College and Xavier are now
driftwood out at sea. With great good
sportsmanship Geelong Grammar has
sent a gift of £25 to each college as a
donation towards cost of rebuilding.
There was a civic reception in the
Town Hall to the Eucharistic Congress
delegates. Archbishop Head made a
speech of welcome and received great
applause. Cardinal Macßory’s remarks
were short and simple. Archbishop
Mannix commenced his address with “I
don’t often come to the Town Hall, but
when I do it’s a great pleasure and I
always find myself in excellent com-
pany.” Premier Argyle was among those
present.
At the Eucharistic Congress. Ball a
highly successful effect in color was
achieved by lighting from outside the
three stained-glass windows which usu-
ally pass unnoticed in the foyer of the
Town Hall. Very bright were the flowers
—red-hot pokers, gladioli, lilies and nas-
turtiums massed in bowls and baskets,
and full-blown golden roses climbing
around the gallery and over a lattice
behind which the noses and eyes of the
band were visible. The stage was camou-
flaged to represent gardens —clumps of
pot-plants and synthetic lawns. The
Papal Legate and his attendants were
escorted to the dais, but the Cardinal s
stay was brief —he’s an old man, and
he’d already attended two garden parties
that day. Little jewelled scarves, twists
of tulle or chiffon, feather capes and all
manner of short cloaks were worn by
the women early in the evening and in
between the dances, for there was a feel-
ing afoot that low-cut gowns should not
be flaunted in the presence of so many
churchmen. Mrs. Reginald Fagen’s coif-
fure was interesting, her upstanding ban-
deau being composed of loops of white
hair worn on her slightly greying locks.
Mrs. Bernard Nolan’s black dress was
edged with tiny frills. Large roses were
embossed into the background of Mrs.
Fred Hesse’s gown. Dr. and Mrs. H.
J. Williams were present, she in a beau-
tiful pink satin robe with a halo plait
in her hair. Mrs. Fred Corder, in gum-
tip-green faille voile, accompanied the
Consul for Malta. Rosemary Kenny’s
citron-shaded frock was flounced with
starched organdie below the trim cut of
her sleek dark hair. Grace Graham’s
lovely white gown was of lace, a sug-
gestion of the pattern broidered in silver
beads, while a fulness below the knee
was achieved by a full tide of foaming
tulle breakers.

THE LITTLE SISTERS.
QUEENSLAND.
Premier Forgan Smith and Captain
Pat Honnor were among those who re-
ceived the Duke of Gloucester at the
border. At Warwick war veterans and
splendidly mounted Light Horse, display-
ing the King’s colors, massed the space
between the station and the town. A
wreath of poppies was laid on the war
memorial there; for the memorial at
Toowoomba white flowers were chosen.
Thirteen debs, made their bow at the
Citizens’ Ball in Toowoomba. The
Mayoress, Mrs. J. D. Annand, introduced
them to the Duke, who danced with
three —Betty Annand, Dorothy Farmer
and Betty Armstrong.
At Gatton College the students
presented the visitor with a kan-
garoo-leather bridle, their own hand-
work. At Ipswich H.R.H. laid the foun-
dation-stone of the new sunshine ward
for children and received a Queensland
woollen rug, manufactured in that
town. At Brisbane he saw buildings and
awnings swarming with people and streets
lined with troops. Two thousand veterans
marched, with the broad-shouldered
figure of Major-General Bill Glasgow
leading.
Dinner at Government House was fol-
lowed by a State reception at Parliament
House. The thousand or so guests
strolled about the House and in the
lighted gardens, where there are great
poinciana-trees, massed with their scarlet'
blooms.
After the Duke had replied to the
address of welcome he left the dais and
sat between Mrs. Forgan Smith and
the CJ.’s wife. He seemed to enjoy the
musical programme, and the chosen
artists certainly were among the best
that Queensland can produce. They
were Marie Bremner, Nancy Muir-
head and Tom Ryan, who sang ; little
.Gloria Foley, a childish figure in a white
frock, quite self-possessed, who drew
melody from her violin ; Berenice Mont-
gomery, the pianist; and Harry Borro-
dale, actor and elocutionist.
Lady Wilson showed us something
new in fashion. Her frock was of coffee-
colored georgette, trained, and with a
softly-draped corsage. She carried a jade
leather fan and wore a handsome tiara.
Marjorie Wilson wore a silver halo with
her frock of water-lily green satin. Mrs.
Forgan Smith wore silver lace, brightened
with a corsage posy of mauve orchids ;
and the Blair lady was draped in floral
chiffon, in tones of black, silver and wine
color. She also sported a tiara. Del-
phinium-blue mariette was chosen by the
Lady Mayoress, Mrs. A. Jones; Com-
mander McFarlane’s better-half looked
sylph-like in white; and Mrs. Ralph
wore beige mariette and lace.
A civic welcome at the Exhibition
Grounds, garnished with fireworks and
other attractions, filled in Wednesday
night. The country’s welcome also was
staged at the Exhibition Grounds on
Thursday. A huge arch of welcome
erected at the main entrance had four
pillars, faced with sugarcane and sur-
mounted by flags. It was ceiled with
ginned cotton, and the inside bases of
the pillars were panelled with some of
the State’s finest timbers.
On Thursday night H.R.H. entertained
a few guests at dinner at Parliament
House before going on to the Combined
Charities’ Ball.'
For the first time in the horticultural
history of Brisbane, red delphiniums
have been produced. They were grown
by Kitty Hillcoat, the popular secretary
of the Combined Charities’ Ball, and
were used on the official supper-table, to-
gether with blue delphiniums and white
shasta daisies. The Duke was received
v by the Lady Mayoress and Mrs. Forgan
Smith, and 21 debs, were presented.
They were Geraldine Moore, Thora
Clarkson, Joyce Glassick, Doris Burgess,
Lorna Massey, Boris Hammar, Dulcie
Sampson, Elspeth Salkeld, Olga Core,
Marjorie Close, Phyllis Edwards, Eliza-
beth Matyear, Audrey Rosser (who came
all the way from Port Moresby), Betty
•> Paterson, Ray and Jean Chenoweth, Joyce
Dali, Heather Ashwin, Angela Keogh,
Doreen Hicks and Phyllis Littler.
The royal and vice-regal parties left
the Charities’ Ball to attend the United
Service Club affair, which was staged at
the huge A.M.L. and F. woolstore in
Macquarie-street, New Farm. Seventeen
more debs, were waiting here to make
their curtsies under the wing of Mrs.
J. Hill, wife of Colonel J. Hill, M.C.,
president of the United Service Club.
Among them were Gwen Cooper, daugh-
ter of the G. G. Coopers, of Warrabah;
Jean Chancellor; Carmel Chaplain;
Betty Clotworthy-Skeffington, daughter
of the late Hon. W. H. Clotworthy-
Skeffington; Mona Freeman; Moira
Kelly, Dr. P. J. Kelly’s daughter (her
pretty stepmother was Babs Barry,
daughter of Captain and Mrs. Michael
Barry); Shirley Mason ; Sepha Scott;
Noelene Glencross Smith, daughter of
Lieut.-Colonel and Mrs. G. H. Glen-
cross Smith; Marjorie Weatherell;
Audrey Currey ; Betty Hudson ; Myrah
Smith ; Nancy Simpson ; Valerie Suter ;
Mary Dal by, and Joan Martyn.
Mr. and Mrs. F. M. Bell and daughter
Orme were with the royal party at both
balls, Mrs. Bell in heavy saxe-blue lace
and Orme in peach pink.
At the Combined Charities’ Ball the
Duke danced with Marjorie Wilson,
Major-General Howard Vyse with Mrs.
F. M. Bell, and tall Captain Schreiber
with Orme Bell.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Very charming was Heather Gell’s
rhythmic play “The Water Babies,” pre-
sented at the Tivoli in aid of charities.
Lady. Dugan was present, and was im-
mensely struck with the performance of
mites from the kindergartens.
Great interest is taken in the approach-
ing visit of Sir Archibald and Lady
Weigall to Adelaide. When they were
at Government House they both enter-
tained and gave generously. It was only
after they left South Australia that the
pubi c learnt how much Lady Weigall
had done to help those in distress.
In spite of the heat, the Town Hall
was crowded for the first concert of the
Adelaide Women’s Choir of 200 voices
Peggy Palmer gave pianoforte items,
Edwin Dalby was solo organist and
Bertha James and Fred Williamson the
solo vocalists. John Dunn accompanied
on the grand organ.
WESTRALIA.
The Historical Society wound up its
season with a well-attended social at the
Karrakatta Club Hall. Vice-president
Mrs. Farrelly, with dove-grey chiffon
nestling in her black georgettes, welcomed
knight Jimmy Mitchell and his ladv,
whose velvet coat covered moss-green
satins. David Lyle sang some old favor-
ites, Joyce Mortlock, Sylvia George and
Alex. Foster gave scenes from “Quality
Street, and Alison Lee’s pupils danced
a rondino and a tarantelle.
Alma Kitchen chose the lounge of the
lovely old Keane’s Point home as the
venue for her marriage to Bruce Wallis.
Her tiara of brilliants, which took the
place of a veil, shone above ivory satin,
classic cut and color-splashed with golden
gladioli which matched the rope of
amber round her throat. Ethel Pilking-
ton attended carrying cloth of gold roses
against jade-green and silver.
Proceeds from the Children’s Hos-
pital fete exceeded expectations. The
Deputy-Lieut.-Gov. opened the show in
the hospital grounds, where the Mitchell
lady’s beige silk crepes hung clear of the
green sward. Minister for Health
Munsie, with his better-half concealing
floral marocains under a navy coat, at-
tended the v.-r. party. A military band
played, and a concert and ballets were
given by Dorothy Dyson’s pupils at after-
noon and evening session.
A couple of hundred bridge players
went along to Mrs. B. Rischbieth’s home
in Cottesloe for a duplicate competition,
organised by Mr. and Mrs. F. Bromilow in
the interests of charity. Unalla’s spacious
rooms, upstairs and down, verandahs and
balconies were occupied by the players,
who shuffled their cards to the fragrance
of flowers and the flapping of flags and
bunting. Mrs. Rischbieth presented the
prizes, and Mrs. Semmens and Mrs.
Cross saw to supper.
Mildred Parker, daughter of a former
Chief Justice, entertained 90 guests with
afternoon-tea at the Hotel Esplanade,
where her Atlantic-blue crepes wound
their way around tables gay with gladioli
After visiting her sisters, Mrs. Turnbull
and Miss Ethel Parker, in Melbourne
Miss Parker will return to Perth for a
few weeks before setting off to England
where her marriage will take place.
TASMANIA.
The E. J. Thorps’ pretty Hobart home
was a picturesque setting for a well-run
dance. Colored lanterns lit up the old
trees in the garden, and dancing took
place m _ the sunroom. Sybil Sale
who was joint hostess with Mrs. Thorn’
was in white crepe. Mrs. Thorp sported
pink satin.
When she walked down the aisle of the
cathedral as Mrs. Frank Peacock, Betty
Ross Reynolds wore heavy white satin,
plainly cut on straight lines, with a very
long train. The tulle veil fell from a halo
of orange-blossom. Molly Shaedel, Mar-
garet Peacock and two wee nieces of the
bridegroom followed. The ’maids looked
like delphiniums in their blue frocks, and
carried bouquets of that flower tied with
long black streamers.
Betty’s friends gave parties for her
nearly every day in the week before her
wedding. The L. F. Piesses, Margaret
Peacock, Molly Schaedel and Mrs. R. N.
Butler were some of the hostesses, and
parties ranged from handkerchief teas
to smart parties at Hadley’s.
Musical circles in Hobart entertained
Mrs. Percy Grainger at parties many and
various during her stay, and she enjoyed
the old-world atmosphere of our stone
houses and gardens full of trees.


Good Health results
from internal
Cleanness"
explains Dr. F. de COURMELLES
—of the Paris Society of Practising Physicians and Surgeons.
DO YOU suffer from every ailment that happens? Have
you constipation, indigestion, gastritis, rheumatism,
neuritis, backache, weakness of any organ, catarrh?
Do you get frequent headaches, catch cold easily? Is your
appetite poor—vitality lacking? These and many other ail-
ments are caused because you unconsciously permit poisons
that bring on disorder and disease to remain in your system.
SELF-POISON INC-the basic cause of
7;
most ill-health
The modern refined, foods we eat
do not stimulate the "bowel
muscles to sufficient action. No
matter how regular your daily
habits, particles of food waste be-
come encrusted on the walls and
crevices of the intestine, and breed
germ - producing poisons which
enter the blood-stream. These
poisons undermine your health—
taking power from the life-giving
organs of nature—making you old
years before your time. It is this
condition of SELF - POISONING
or autoxima that physicians de-
clare to be the basic cause of most
ill-health. Self-poisoning is all the
more to be dreaded because it is
so insidious—you suffer, but do not
know that this toxic condition is the
cause of vcar sufferings.

Outback Travel Long Ago
BY WILL LAWSON.
OLD drivers of Cobb and Co.’s have
told me of nights away west of
Bourke slogging along in the rain
—how at a “cross-roads” a shadowy
figure on horseback would be seen, wait-
ing for the coach to get his mail. He
might have ridden 20 or 30 miles to
meet it.
The coach stopped, the blowing horses
glad of the rest.
The driver spoke.
“G’night, Tom!”
“G’night, Jim! Any mail?”
“No. No mail. G’night! Geddap!”
The lonely rider was left to return
home empty-handed.
But sometimes there was excitement.
When mining became busy, the gold
was carried by the coaches in the mail.
No secret was made of the shipments,
and, as no escorts were provided, hold-
ups were frequent.
In 1881, a new field had been opened
at Mt. Brown, 200 miles south of Wil-
cannia and 400 miles from Bourke. There
was heavy traffic on this run. And often
there were floods to combat. Many a
time the horses would be forced, plung-
ing and nervous, into rivers so deep that
they could only struggle through, half-
swimming and half-pulling. Only their
frantic efforts got them through.
Carrying opals from White Cliffs to
Broken Hill was another risky job for
the coaches. Like the gold, the opals
went by mail. One night six armed,
masked men held up a coach, rifled the
mailbags and rode away unharmed with
their booty. But one made the fatal mis-
take of firing a shot at the driver. He
missed, but hit a passenger. The police
tracked him down, and he got 10 years
for robbery under arms.
On the same route one night, while the
coach was toiling through heavy sand, a
man crept up behind and cut the mail-
bags off the rear “boot.” After that, a
mounted policeman rode with every
coach which carried gold or opals.
Opposition came to Cobb and Co. in
the western districts of New South Wales
in 1885, when T. and W. Doyle started.
They were given a contract to carry mails
from Bourke to Wanaaring ; later it was
extended to Hungerford. Doyles’ coaches
never missed a mail.
There were no bridges then. In flood-
time, traffic ceased—till Doyles’ coaches
came. These proprietors had a boat at
North Bourke where the bridge stands
to-day. Passengers and mails were fer-
ried across and put into another coach
on the opposite side. The same process
was carried out at the Warrego River
and at Cuttaburra Creek, and so on to the
Paroo. It was hard for everyone when
it rained and hell for the horses.
Cobbs had no boats, but they did all
that was human, to get their coaches
across. One of these had a thrilling trip
across the Paroo at Willerah station.
Duncan McGregor, of Mt. Magnet sta-
tion, John Ryan, of Willerah, one of the
Morrisons and another man tried to swim
the coach and horses across. But the
river was too deep. It became a question
of saving the horses, and after frantic
efforts this was done. Then they started
on the coach. The men took deep breaths,
dived and turned the wheels a few inches
at a time. Slowly and painfully they got
the coach to the bank, harnessed up
again and drove on. All that was lost
was the leaders’ harness.
Droughts were far worse than floods.
The horses became skeletons. At the
end of a stage they could hardly walk.
Fresh teams only went willingly for a
mile or so. The whips did the rest.
More exciting than floods or droughts
were the days of the big shearers’ strike
in 1887. The coaches were bringing up
strike-breakers, and the striking shearers
said they would stop every coach on the
roads. The coaches still ran. Drivers
were armed and passengers warned that
they carried their lives in their hands.
But they still travelled—even women
risked stray shots in roadside melees.
As the trouble continued, Magistrate
McCarthy went out from . Bourke and
read the Riot Act. The lawlessness con-
tinued, so Sergeant Day and three con-
stables were sent out, and arrested some
men. Soon after that the strike died,
and the coaches ran in safety.
The coaches in the western districts of
the Eastern States ceased running when
Ford cars came in about 1913. Bridges
span most of the rivers to-day, and the
“port of Bourke,” where coaches and
steamers met in the roaring days, is now
a railhead, also Brewarrina and Cobar,
which means that the rail takes every-
thing straight to the coast. The Broken
Hill mail thunders over the bridge at
Menindie, and passengers may look out
and maybe see a river steamer carrying
station stores up or wool down the river.
But they will see no coaches., -
The river steamers have outlived the
coaches, though their numbers and scope
have been limited. At one time the
river services extended from Goolwa, at
the mouth of the Murray, to Walgett in
New South Wales, a distance of 1700
miles; and there were many tributary
rivers which they served. The longest
run ever made by a river steamer of the
Murray or Darling was from Sydney to
Echuca, over 2000 miles, by sea and
river.
The voyage was made 50 years ago
by the Amphibious, a twin-screw steamer
of 30 tons, built on a seagoing model-
most of the river steamers were flat-bot-
tomed. Her captain, Donald Mcßeth,
sailed from Sydney without a Customs
clearance, there being doubts of getting
one. His little steamer went through a
southerly gale ' which wrecked a barque
fifty times her size, and came at last to
the mouth of the Murray.
“I don’t want a pilot,” the captain said.
“This little rat will find a hole in the
sand somewhere.”
And she did, and steamed to Echuca,
where she was arrested for disobeying
regulations in Sydney/ The steamer was
soon released, and ran for many years
between Morgan and Wentworth.
The Amphibious entered a world of
steamers, all registered at Sydney, Mel-
bourne or Adelaide, and plying on the
rivers from Walgett to Murray Bridge—
all kinds of steamers with all sorts of
engines and boilers. -
Many will remember the Wentworth,
built in the 1860’s. She had oscillating,
high-pressure engines, and ran fast trips
on the Murray and Darling. Usually
Bourke was the last up-river port, but
some of the bolder skippers in “high
rivers” went to Brewarrina and even
Walgett.
The Sturt, a long boat of the Pickles
line, in command of Captain Lynd,
loaded wool at Brewarrina and also took
as passengers a theatrical company which
was “doing” the prosperous western
towns. At the Brewarrina Rapids there
is a sharp bend. The Sturt missed the
turn and ran ashore with her nose be-
tween two trees. The strong current
broke her in two, but no lives were lost.
Men still tell of the Freetrader. She
was a big side-paddle boat with an old
Victorian locomotiye boiler, and had a
speed with the current of 20 knots and
about 14 knots against the stream. She
was given all sorts of fancy strips where
speed was needed. The .Freetrader was
the relief ship when the barge Leviathan
sprang a leak while in tow of the steamer
Golconda on the way to Bourke with a
cargo of merchandise, pianos, beer and
rum. Captain Brown, of the Golconda,
was averse to giving the salvage crews
rum, but the underwriters’ representatives
insisted on it, as the best way to make
them work.
The Freetrader’s men and the crew
of the Golconda worked side by side in
bailing-out the barge, till the rum began
to talk. Then a fight started; the
barge slowly sank in deep water, and
her freight littered the river. The beach-
combers and whalers for miles had a
harvest. • •. ; \’■
Nearly all the old boats are gone now:
the Victoria, which once got to Wagga,
the Jupiter, Warradgery, Wilcannia and
Excelsior —all stern-wheelers —the Prin-
cess, Albury and Jane Eliza —passenger
boats with speed—the Lancashire Lass,
Kelpie, Pioner, Maranoa, Pearl and
Murrumbidgee, and the J.H.P., which
turned turtle in 1870.
The outback of the Eastern States is
deserted now, save for the service cars and
the teams. Dingoes played such havoc
that most of the sheepmen sold out to
cattle king Kidman. The sheep gave way
to cattle, and many of the homesteads
fell into ruin. The stations thus changed
over were Wanaaring, Tinagapee,
Uriseno, Elsinore, Berriwinnia, Thirlow
Downs, Bootra, Yantara, Yankaannia,
Cobbam Lake, Morden, Wannamintra,
, Nindora, Momba, Pernanga and Mt.
Murchison.
These names recall the days when the
roads and rivers out there were highways
of a continent.


Pelmanism
Scientific training of Mind,
Memory and Personality
MEN AND WOMEN FOR 1935
It is when men and women are their own natural
selves, with their own peculiar powers at the highest
pitch of development, that they are at their best.
They then give untrammeled expression to their own
individuality; they are bold, courageous and success-
ful because they trust themselves.
This is the keynote of the Pelman System for training
the mind and memory and developing the personality.
The Pelman System trains men and women as indi-
viduals. It shows them how to make the most of
themselves, how to make full use of their special
aptitudes; it helps each pupil to define an aim and
it indicates to each the lines along which he or she
can travel to a successful realisation of that aim.
The Pelman System really trains. It teaches certain
principles based on natural laws, but it is primarily
a system of training whereby individual qualities and
attributes are developed so that the Pelmanist can,
in business, in the home (housewives please note)
and in social life, be sure of himself or herself, so
that he will find pleasure in the effort which the
competition of others makes necessary as well as in
the periods of relaxation to which we are all entitled.
Amongst these attributes and qualities are: —
Observation
Concentration
Judgment
Decision
Will-Power
Self-Confidence
Social Ease
Presence of Mind
Initiative
Promptness
And a Reliable Memory
These qualities are the base on which steadiness,
serenity, stability and energy rest. They will be as
valuable and as necessary to success and happiness
in 1935 as they have been in the years that have
gone. Pelmanism strengthens them until they
become habitual and are exercised in all the affairs
of life, and so the Pelmanist secures that happiest
of all possessions, a way of life, thought and work
that earns the respect of his associates, makes him
effective in his regular employment and lifts him to
the top of any special occasion that may arise.
More than 31,000 men and women in Australia and New Zealand have enrolled for the
Pelman Course with the Institute in Melbourne. Below are opinions received recently
from some of them. The relationship between the Institute and its members is a most
happy one, and we could fill a whole “Bulletin” with such letters.
Whilst. visiting many, large centres and
interviewing- large numbers of business and
professional men, I lmve found repeatedly
coming to my aid the benefits of the Pel-mail
Course.—Doct or.
Keener interest in life and improved
greatly in Self-Confidence, Personality and
Memory. Conducting my social life confi-
dently and more efficiently.—Clerk.
I took up the Course with the main object
of overcoming a reserved nature, which pre-
cluded me from taking part, in discussions
of policy and in debates. I have achieved
this object. Also, I find myself rapidly
acquiring a larger circle of friends.—Farmer.
Last month 1 won a Flying Scholarship
for which there were 210 entrants. 1 thank
Pelmunism for this success, chiefly because
of the wonderful manner in which it has
increased my self-confidence.—Clerk.
My main object (the desire to overcome
the impediment in my speech) in taking up
the Course has been attained. —Sheep Farmer.
I am amazed at the manner in which these
printed lessons time and again hit upon,
and deal with, what I have always considered
as my own personal and particular problems.
—Engineer.
I am conscious of much greater freedom
in preaching—also of fertility of ideas. Last
Sunday I preached four times to different
congregations on practically the same sub-
ject with scarcely any repetition.—Clergy-
man.
Thanks to Pelmanism, I have instituted a
system into the harvesting which worked out
without a hitch, and have taken off a record
crop with less expense per ton, and in a
shorter time than ever I have done before.—
Horticulturist.
it may interest you to know that my
figures for the first quarter this year show
an increase of .‘lO per cent. —Commercial
Traveller.
I feel physically and mentally alive and
ready for my day's work. I can find interest
in it now, when I was beginning to think I
had made a mistake.—Engineer.
. . . Considerable progress in my conver-
sational efforts, which are now a pleasure
and relaxation instead of an embarrass-
ment. —Assessor.
I am grateful to the Institute for showing
me how to use my mind . . . Pelmanism
is an enemy of fear and ignorance, it is
packed with commonsense and practical
advice and with inspiration to bigger living.
—Clerk.
I wish to express my gratitude to Pei-
manisin. I feel entirely remade. My obser-
vation, concentration, personality and. above
all, my memory have improved.—Chemist.
I now have ideals, thoughts and an out-
look which enable me to increase my efforts
towards the goal of honesf, honourable and
successful endeavour. —Bank Clerk.
I have enjoyed and appreciated the Pelman
Course as I have rarely enjoyed anything
before. —Articled Clerk.

LORD HALIFAX DEFINES
THE PERFECT MAN:
. . . that it is not enough to
impart certain definite knowledge
and skill of hand, but that it is
necessary to train intelligence in
order to make full use of what
has been learnt.
“And now we are learning that
knowledge and intelligence are
not enough without certain quali-
ties of mind and spirit self-
discipline, steadiness, considera-
tion—in short, a balance and
poise of mind that goes to make
up the perfect man.”
The P,elman Institute is a world-wide
organisation of 30 years’ standing.
Its headquarters are in London.
