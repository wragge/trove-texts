THE MOUTH THE GATEWAY for DISEASE.
Scientists have proved conclusively that no /ewer
than 38 different infections may be traced to the
human mouth as a starting point. The mouth thus
being the gateway for the entrance of disease, it
is here that precautions are most necessary.
Hudson’s Eumenthol
Jujubes
Are the most powerful, safe and pleasant Germi-
cide and Antiseptic known. Beinp' destructive to
all organises which give rise to infectious diseases,
they keep the mouth in a sweet, healthy condition.
The Lancet (London) states: —“Their purpose is to
act as a bactericide in the mouth. This result is
Lately to be gained, for in the experiments tried
Eumenthol Jujubes proved to be as effective bac-
tericidally as is creosote.”

Feminine Psychology
Studying feminine psychology in tile light
of human history, one fact that emerges
seems of particular significance: there has
never been a woman philosopher. To the
feminine mind the impersonality of the philo-
sopher is simply inhumanity ; and it would
seem that woman’s contribution to progress
has been inconsiderable on the intellectual
side partly by reason of this inability to be
impersonal. Man progresses in proportion as
he perceives the principles underlying the
play of personalities and appearances. To
do this the individual must be capable, in
thought, at least, of externalising himself
from his emotions and egoism ; he must eye
himself and his friends as a god would—
aloofly and impersonally. In examining his-
tory he must ignore the purely personal attri-
butes of the individuals that throng its pages,
the better to discern what was purposive and
prophetic in the impulses and aspirations
that animated them. He must see the “soul
of truth in things erroneous,” the tendency
towards order that exists even amidst
anarchy. And. above all, and despite all
vanity and disillusionment, he must retain
a steady vision of the unity towards which
all things tend. All that is rather foreign
to feminine mentality.
Havelock Ellis, in a recent essay, lays
great stress on what he calls woman’s “affec-
tability,” and points out that when she does
happen to take an interest in politics her
support is usually given to the extreme Right
or the extreme Left. And from either ex-
treme both the basic moral idea of good-
ness in things evil and the basic religious
idea of universal unity are likely to be lost.
Thus it happens that woman is actually less
moral and less religions than man. But it
may be objected that it has been woman who
has always filled the churches, woman who
has been most concerned with the observance
of moral codes. Remembering that our
churches and moral codes are for the most
part merely obsolescing or obsolescent vehicles
of human progress, these facts rather justify
than controvert the main contention. Woman
is of the earth earthy, and will fanatically
support any material manifestation that
offers an outlet for her emotionalism and
staff for her servility, regardless of its spiri
tual significance. She is rarely an idealist
but often an idolist. Thus she is more con
cerned with keeping Up appearances than i
man, and usually forgets they are appear
ances. She has a more intense respect fo
ceremonies and creeds, and is vastly mor
impressed with the importance of dress anc
deportment. In this way she might be
rightly held to be a stronger supporter o :
the material manifestations of morality anc
religion than is man.
The life of sensual experience is assuredly
more real to her than it is to him, which
is why, when she chooses to be logical, she
is usually more ruthlessly logical than he
Wherefore she is practical rather than pro-
gressive. It might be objected here that
woman’s release from male despotism has
been too recent and too partial to give her
much chance of self-realisation as yet. Which
is so, of course; but it appears as if her
limitations in some respects are fundamental.
It is a strikingly significant fact that woman
has'never equalled man in creative arts, while
she excels him in the personal and imitative
art of the mime. This has been sometimes
put down to lack of opportunity; but
genius has in the nature of things
inevitably lacked opportunity. It is only
to the conformist opportunity is given ; the
very superiority of a great man separates
him from his fellows. Incidentally, apart
from any question of creative ability, this
separation in itself would be almost intoler-
able to woman, who is more gregarious in
her instincts than is man. But as to the
basic reason of her lesser creative capacity,
that obviously must go deeper than mere
environmental inequalities. A view that is
widely accepted is that creative capacity is re-
lated to sexual energy. The coincidence that
man possesses a greater store of sexual energy
than woman, and also, at the same time,
greater spiritual powers of creation, would
seem to support this theory. With some
truth we may describe the creative impulse
as the heavenward flight of the sex instinct.
From the foregoing it would appear as if
woman had been a mere spectator in the
drama of human progress. But there is more
to be said. _ When we descend from the most
exalted heights of human activity we find
that she is his equal or potential equal in
general, while she excels in several significant
particulars. Moreover, if it be true that
the creative capacity represents a sublima-
tion of surplus sexual energy, then the dis-
parity in distribution of sexual energy has
surely operated to secure creative power for
the race.as a whole. But apart from any
indirect influences on progress which arises
out ot interaction between sexes, woman pos-
sesses certain excellences peculiar to herself.
k lie is more patient than man in the face of
adversity, more practically protective to-
wards the feeble and helpless. This latter
attribute, which is an outcome of the mater-
nal instinct, accounts for her greater in-
terest in philanthropic pursuits. Moreover,
she is the homemaker of the species, and
originator of most of the little social cour-
tesies which, though frequently smacking of
insincerity, have helped to emancipate the
male from his primitive turbulence.
it has been remarked how her emotional
tanaticism. and resultant inability to adhere
o impersonal ideals, accounts for her" com-
parative barrenness in the fields of dynamic
engion and dynamic morality; it remains
to state a cause for such fanaticism'. Woman
Places persons before principles because the
maternal instinct bids her do so. Only such
emotional fanaticism as she displays would
inspire the great self-sacrifice the care of
children has involved, and still involves to
a certain extent. That now the State
assumes a responsibility for the child, and
that the tendency of modern times is to
ameliorate the severity of the maternal sacri-
nce, suggests that a loss powerful impulse
than has proved necessary will now suffice.
i nd signs are not lacking that the maternal
jnstipet begins to find more impersonal out-
pts. that for which it was originated.
i>ut at least we are now enabled to see the
real justification for feminine fanaticism, and
to realise that it would have gone ill with
the human race if the impersonality which
has been such a source of strength in the
male had existed in like degree in the female.
One glance now into futurity. It seems
probable that masculine and feminine men-
tality will tend in the future to coincide more
closely. The differences we perceive are
rather of degrees than of kind. And with the
disappearance of such environmental inequali-
ties as are artificially imposed, many of the
present differences will tend to disappear.
The relief from economic and social servitude
will have far-reaching consequences in the
elimination of many existing feminine
characteristics. For instance, the woman of
the future will certainly develop powers of
initiative unknown to her somewhat servile
sister of to-day. She will display less faith
in ceremonies, creeds and such like staffs, so
necessary to the sex in our time. For the
rest it has been noted how the maternal in-
stinct tends to find more impersonal expres-
sion than heretofore, and we may legitimately
hope that woman’s emotional fanaticism will
decrease in consequence. But when all the
influences at present perceptible have ful-
filled their mission, there will probably still
remain a residue of differences between the
sexes that are inherent. One set of differ-
ences that seem likely to persist, though with
considerable modification, are related to the
maternal instinct. The physiological basis of
psychological differences is here too great to
permit of the latter’s entire elimination. An-
other set of differences that seem likely to
continue arise from disparity in distribution
of sexual energy. But when it is clearly
understood that peculiarities of parts are
essential to the harmony of the whole, differ-
ences will no longer be i;aken to indicate
either inferiority or superiority.

Conrad
I met Conrad for the first and last time in
Fisher Unwin’s offiee in the Adelphi.
A harsh voice, and eyes grim, sardonic,
with rather a weary expression in them. He
was just off on a trip to America, and had
fallen into the hands of Carmelite House.
They had offered him fabulous sums for a
series of short articles, and he had been un-
able to resist.
Fisher Unwin, now ft hale old gentleman
of 70, gave Conrad his first chance.
“Almayer’s Folly,” on which the windjam-
mer’s mate had labored long and sedulously
for many a year, was accepted by Unwin for
inclusion in his First Novel series. That
was 30 years ,ago, and there are those who
declare that Conrad’s first was his best.
Many a sailorman the world over will
feel a pang of regret at the passing of Con-
rad. The Pole was a sailors’ man in the
fullest sense of the term, and there are few
cabins where one or other of his yarns do
not find a place on the bookshelf. His stuff
has a curious fascination for that vast body
of men who man the merchant navies of
the world. Merchantmen—for your naval
officer finds little appeal in novels which
have for setting a background in which he is
as much as a stranger as any longshoreman''.
Conrad was the real Laureate of the Sea—
not Kipling, though the latter has tossed
off some glorious sea-gems in his time. Kip-
ling was always the passenger—a passenger
with a trained journalistic eye, which regis-
tered with incredible swiftness and accuracy
the thousand and one facets of shipboard life.
But when the ship drew alongside after the
voyage, Kipling was standing by the gang-
way ready to walk on shore, out of the
ship and out of the lives of the crew. Not
so Conrad. He was one of the crew. How
different, too, in their style! The one
quick, clever, pert almost, and losing
no opportunity of impressing the reader
with his hastily-acquired knowledge;
the other devious, wordy, labored. In plot-
construction, the one straightforward, crisis
leading to climax, and then the steep fall-
away of the denouement ; the other with a
plot like a maze. In “Lord Jim” over a
hundred pages must be waded through be-
fore the reader is permitted to learn the facts
of the hero’s blighted career. In “The Shadow
Line more than half the book is takeu
un with the preparations for the voyage to-
wards the Shadow Line.
Yes, a wordy, devious man, but his work
rock-hewn and beautifully chiselled. Vast
backgrounds, yet painted with meticulous
care and skill, based on first-hand knowledge
and observation ; characters who move like
the demi-gods of old, as if driven by some
Nemesis to their predestined end. Above all,
a master of atmosphere, who knew how to
conjure up the uneasy brooding of Eastern
seas. It is difficult to define, as atmosphere
should be, but. none the less it is there in
all his work, inchoate, intangible, formless,
but all-pervading.
G. RAWSON.
More Romantic Realism
Outside the minds of critics it is doubtful
if there is such a thing as a complete Eng-
lish realist, with the possible exception of
piquant Jane Austen. In any case the dis-
tinction between realism and romance will
always be one of methpd rather than of
matter. It may be something more than
pure coincidence that the word “realism”
first appeared in the French dictionary of
the year of reaction, 1848. At a time when
scientific theories were springing up like
mushrooms and bourgeois ideals flourished
exceedingly, the growth of journalism helped
to foster the cult of the real. Realism was
to the world of letters what Positivism was
to philosophy: on the one hand Balzac, on
the other, Auguste Comte. But if romanti-
cism in the dashing days of the Second Em-
pire had given color to politics, exalting the
disinterestedness of the leaders of the people
arid shouting the cry of universal brother-
hood, prosperity, already a little vulgar and
the might of the Stock Exchange soon made
such displays of imagination hopelessly old-
fashioned. Enthusiasm, worn threadbare
was fair game for bitter irony. Nobody

FOR SERVICE—OPP. G.P.O. SYDNEY.
seemed to remember that 20 years earlier
Stendhal had tried to show m Le Rouge et
le Xoir” that a dispassionate record ot
human life was the surest means of crusl -
i Twic tjjg type of romance that decked Rselt
out in the tawdry furbelows of rhetoric, l ie
typical man of letters was no longer tlm
romantic aristocrat Chateaubriand whose
picturesque egoism was lus greatest charm.
It was the day of the democrat-novelist whose
aim was to keep the rein on personality, not
to create but to represent the new bourgeois
world of men and things.
Realism was not new to France. Eor cen-
turies it had been a tradition with her writ-
ing-men of the road, the doubttnlly-reputable
authors of the old fabliaux. With her great
classical writers it was different. . Ihey
were realists in virtue of their passion for
truth, though this was often dwarfed by
their very intuition of the heroic and the
large, which was always at the beck and call
of an overmastering poetic convention. They
knew realism simply in terms of the comic.
Its tragic possibilities were to be seized on
and elaborated by Balzac. From romantic
Walter Scott he learnt a good deal about
the importance of detail and local color. At
first lie exaggerated, but not too much for
“society” to be so flattered by his pictures
that it began to grow like them. Sainte-
Reuve said in 1850 : “One now furnishes one's
house a la Balzac” Working on the fan-
hour<ift with his camel-liair brush, Balzac
subtly combined the qualities of artist and
worldling. His earlier books opened up for
fiction a new Pandora’s box with an unfor-
gettable crowd of middle-class old maids and
bachelors, scent manufacturers, fops and
queer duchesses. At its greatest height his
imagination dissected them with almost
scientific exactness, laying bare a world
whose emotions were not infrequently en-
tangled with the money market. He was
curiously fascinated by the idea of money.
It was part of his peculiar sensitiveness to
the importance of things; and things, to him,
meant chiefly francs and centimes. In
“Cesar Birotteau” they form a kind of motif
worked out with an inevitability and sure-
ness which such a modern as Mr. Stephen
Mac Kenna fell notably short of in “Midas
and Son.” This and the middle-aged heroine
were two of Balzac’s chief contributions to
the novel. After him came the naturalists
with their analyses and experiments.
Flaubert’s great experiment was Guy de
Maupassant. Intellectually his foster-father,
Flaubei't would say to him, “Go for a walk
and come back and tell me in a hundred
lines what you have seen.” Enter a fresh
tradition. Impartially exact and impersonal,
he has no aesthetic axe to grind, no pre-occu-
pation with morality. His short stories
have the superb art of consummate indiffer-
ence. When biology waved its wand over
the novel in the early ’sixties, the transfor-
mation scene revealed Zola with his “human
beast,” the man of instincts. A realist who
is romantic enough by temperament to ideal-
ise the ugly by the sheer lyric power of his
imagination is sometimes forced to compro-
mise with what Balzac calls the hypocrisy
of the beautiful. Zola lived long enough to
do this in Dr. Pascal, the last of the Rougon-
Macquart series.
The novelist who lays claim to realism
makes his world amongst men and women at
grips with more or less terrible forces. He
is in the toils of the commonplace to such
an extent that he turns romantic in self-
defence or, following the path of least resist-
ance, trades in the brand of sensationalism
which the Goncourts used with such masterly
effect. The mere determination to shock by
reproducing ugliness does not make a realist,
as someone has said of Mr. Compton Macken-
zie’s “Sylvia Scarlett.” If from the midst
of murder and love, sex instinct and death
lie can draw strength and beauty, the neces-
sity for introducing manufactured “romance”
ceases to exist.
The realism of 1850 and the naturalism of
Zola put the novel on speaking terms with
parvenu nature. Yet the very finality of its
technique and the inherent possibilities of
perfection were quite enough to undermine
it even if such a thing as absolute realism
had ever existed.
The strength of the English “realists”
lies, above all, in their studies of childhood.
To them fiction owes the real child —the sub-
stitution of “Stalky and Co.” for “Sandford
and Merton”—changelings within living
memory. Who would not change mid-Vic-
torian “little Elsie,” who was “so bad she
almost wished papa would whip her,” for
Charlotte and Selina of the whirling fancies
m Mr. Kenneth Grahame’s “Golden Age”?
The romantics have given us the limber mind
the child, dreams, endearing naughtinesses
and all—moods, by the way, charmingly cap-
tured in Mr. Furnley Maurice’s “Bay and
I adie Book.” Not the kind of boy
we meet in the “Brothers Karamazov,”
who was fond of hanging cats and
burying them with great ceremony, with a
sheet for a surplice and a makeshift censer.
One meets every-day small boys like Mr.
Hugh Walpole’s glorious eight-year-old
Jeremy, who loftily condescends to small sis-
ters in the intervals of pursuing private
romance; who cannot quite manage to keep
God and Queen Victoria properly assorted in
his large, young mind. And first among
these romantic realists is Barrie, of the
Round Pond, own father to Tommy and
“realist” who thought of mapping
children s minds—the only modern who eA 7 cr
invented a fairy.

A Chastened Anarchist
It is a great pity that the sane section
of Australian Labor cannot persuade more
of its Soviet sympathisers, its Internationale
advocates, its “Down with Defence!” en-
thusiasts, to investigate a little more closely
the conditions in Russia itself—the land
that plumped for Communism and wanted
to abolish both army and navy, and that
made a partly-successful attempt to exter-
minate its bourgeois and its intelligentsia,
Some four years ago Emma Goldman, an
anarchist of world-wide fame, being deported
from America, dropped into what she was
accustomed to call “the Land of Promise.”
In My Disillusionment in Russia (Double-
day Page) she records her impressions of
things there, and is so unkind as to allude
to her life in the land of Trotsky
as her “ghastly experience. All my life,
she says, “Russia’s heroic struggle tor free-
dom had been as a beacon to me, and
now “Soviet Russia was luring me. Sovie,.
Russia is also luring a considerable section
of Australia’s Labor extremists, but. un-
like them, Emma Goldman went; and when,
in company with a few friends, she arrived
at the Russian border and a few emissaries
of the Soviet Government met them, so great
was her emotion that she writes: "I pre-
ferred to be alone as I touched the sacred
soil; my exaltation was too great, and I
feared i might not be able to control my
emotion.” Alas for fine emotions and noble
sentiments! —that was the last of them.
The Australians, unfortunately, resist alik<-
the lure and the disillusion.
Graft is quite as common under the
Soviets as in the land of Uncle Sam, she
says. In the “common dining-rooms the best
food went to a number of officials, com-
mandants and inspectors.” “The masters
have everything,” she was told by the starv-
ing citizens. “The masters have white
bread, clothing, even chocolate, while we
have nothing. Communism, equality, free-
dom—lies and deception !”
Naturally, Miss Goldman visited some of
the Communist industrial establishments,
Concerning one she says :
The great flour-mill of Petrograd looked as if it
were in a state of siege, with armed soldiers every-
where, even inside the workrooms. The explanation
given was that large quantities of precious flora- had
been vanishing; The soldiers watched the millmeri
as if they had been galley-slaves, and the workers
naturally resented such humiliating treatment. They
hardly dared to speak. One young chap, a fine-looking
fellow, complained to me of the conditions. “We are
here virtual prisoners,” he said; “we cannot make
a step without permission. We are kept hard at
work eight hours with only ten minutes for our
kipyatok [boiled water], and we are searched on
leaving the mill.”
“Is not the theft of flour the cause of this strict
surveillance?” I asked.
“Not. at all,” replied the boy. “The Com-
'missars of the mill and the soldiers know quite
well where the flour goes to.” 1 suggested the
workers might protest. “Protest to whom?” the boy
exclaimed. “We'd be called speculators and counter-
revolutionists and we’d be arrested.”
The Communist authorities, she insists, lioh!
human life in small esteem, and are accus-
tomed to take it easily and suddenly. If
you protest that human life should have
some value you are accused of “bourgeois sen-
timentality.” The hapless Jews are still
the victims of a steady, unceasing persecu-
tion. A Jew may be the victim of a “violent
pogrom” that may last a day or a week or
he may be harried to death under a “silent
pogrom,” which signifies “constant discrimi-
nation. persecution and hounding.” They
are all the time exposed to insult and in-
dignities, and many are doomed to slow
starvation.
An article in the Petrograd Pravda dis-
closed terrible conditions in the schools. A
Wmmittee of the Young Communist organ-
isations investigated some of the institutions.
They found the children dirty, verminous,
sleeping on filthy mattresses, fed on. miser-
able food, punished by being locked in dark
rooms for the night, forced to go without
their suppers, and even beaten. The number
of officials and employees in the schools was
nothing less than criminal. In one school
there were 138 of them to 125 children, in
another 40 to 25 children. All these para-
sites were taking the bread from the mouths
of the unfortunate pupils. On the other
hand, there exists a class of “preferred
schools” wherein children are trained with
special care in Communistic theory. Dis-
tinguished visitors, such as H. G. Wells, are
shown around these “preferred” institutions
and given to understand that they are typi-
cal. Miss Goldman laughs at their credu-
lity.
It was one of the reproaches against the
old English factory system that women were
employed'under the most insanitary condi-
tions by the mill-owners in the days of un-
regulated private enterprise. Miss Gold-
man found Russian females still employed in
State tobacco factories under the most un-
healthy conditions. “The air in the work-
rooms' was stifling, nauseating—but the
women (said the guide) are used to it and
don’t mind. There were pregnant women
at work, and girls no older than 14. They
looked haggard, their chests sunken, black
rings under their eyes. Some of them
coughed, and the hectic flush of consumption
showed on their faces. The women remained
at work eight consecutive hours; they had
their tea and black bread at their benches.”
The system was piecework. Liza Zorin, a
lady Communist of some tonnage, claimed
that that was the only way to make the girls
do their utmost.
The picture drawn by Miss Goldman is
a vivid one and bears the impress of truth.
Throughout her narrative stands out the
glaring fact that Privilege—the privilege of
the few to the detriment of the many—-is
just as rampant to-day as it was under the
old regime. The masses, as usual in all
great upheavals, have changed masters
—that is all. Some of the Communists are
frank enough to confess the glaring defects
of their regime. But the justification .is
Party—the “interests of the Cause.” Liza
Zorin was asked what purpose had the Re-
volution served if such small improvements
as rest-rooms for female workers could not
be provided. Miss Zorin was prompt and
frank —“The workers have achieved control.
They are now in power, and have more im-
portant things to attend to than rest-rooms
—they have the Revolution to defend.” The
good old argument that does such yeoman
service all the world over. It means that
Party is an end, not a means, the end being
the glorification and the enrichment of the
party bosses.
P. AIREY.
National Literature
Mr. Mickle, in liis article on “National
Literature” (R.P. 24/7/’24), seems to me
to have waded up to his waist in fallacy. He
is contradictory, disconcertingly uncritical,
and even his final moral cannot be deduced
from his own premises. His large
generalities and abstractions would mean,
if they mean anything at all. that there is
no such thing as any national literature,
Great literature is universal. Shakspeare,
Emerson and Turgenev, Mr. Mickle’s queerly
original triumvirate, write for mankind.
“quite irrespective of time or place.” It is
not important how Emerson wrote, and it
would be a bold man or a fool who presumed
to understand Shakspeare’s msthetic; but the
case of Turgenev is instructive and to the
point. Turgenev is held up as an example
of a writer who was “universal” and had no
concern with “the ever-changing habits and
customs and conventions that are local and
common only to certain nations of men.”
But as a plain matter of fact Turgenev whs
intensely preoccupied with Russian affairs,
even the local habits and customs.. The aboli-
tion of serfdom, which was purely a local
and temporary question, occupied the first
place in liis thoughts. As George Sand wrote
to him in regard to his “Sportsman’s
Sketches,” surely one of the most national
books ever written: “What a master-hand
the painting shows! How well one sees and
hears and knows those northern peasants
who were still serfs at the time you write of
them, and those small squires and nobles, a
few moments' conversation with whom was
sufficient to enable you to draw a picture
of them, palpitating with life and color.”
To exemplify Mr. Mickle’s theory Turgenev
should have chosen more universal and less
local subjects ; but strangely enough, though
lit; spent many years abroad, he wrote a
series of novels which dealt only with the
intimate and characteristic life of his own
country and epoch. As he said of Gogol:
“He revealed his fellow-countrymen to them-
selves.” Turgenev remained a Russian to
the marrow of his bones. When his body
was on the point of leaving France, Edmond
About delivered an address in which lie said :
“France would have adopted you with pride
had you so willed it, but you always re-
mained faithful to Russia. Slit' it is whom,
before all and above all, you have served.”
At one time, in order to disparage Turgenev, it
was said that some of his stories were first
written in French or German. His protest
was vehement. “I have never published a
single line in anything but Russian ; if I
had I should not be an artist but a scribbler
beneath contempt.” Language itself is local,
the expression of the racial spirit. We shud-
der at the thought of what literature will be
like when, it becomes “universal,” and is
written in Esperanto! Turgenev serves as
a high and admirable model for any Austra-
lian novelist. lie contradicts finally and
absolutely Mr. Mickle’s contention that a
national literature includes writers “irre-
spective of what parts of the world they
write of or what people or what subjects.”
He must be acquainted with Turgenev’s many
times quoted saying: “Russia can do with-
out any of us, but none of us can do with-
out Russia.”
In our own little sphere Mr. Mickle’s mis-
understanding of Henry Lawson is surpris-
ing. He puts him with other writers, and
thinks he is of the same class because he
deals with somewhat similar subjects—“swag-
men,” for example. It is hard to see how
Lawson “idealises” or falsifies our country
life in order to make a popular sentimental
appeal. The writer who is provincial and
not national splashes on the “local color”
and “idealises” his characters after the
fashion of the film; but this was never Law-
son’s way. As it happens, Lawson, who is
our most national writer (I refer only to
his prose tales and sketches; not, of course,
to his verse, in which he was seldom him-
self), is the only one who has made any
kind of international headway or universal
appeal.
The misunderstanding arises from confus-
ing a writer’s actual subject matter with the
aesthetic result he achieves. A Russian novel
even in translation can be as intimate to us
as any English novel. The great masters
cross frontiers and centuries, and are valid
in any age or country. But because they
are universal in their appeal the tacile bur
wrong conclusion is often drawn that they deal
with subjects stripped of all local and tem-
porary associations. The truth is the other
way about. The writer who aims at univer-
sality by selecting what he considers only
large and general subjects, independent of
place and time, usually achieves sterility.
On the contrary, the truly great artist can
transmute the humblest material and reveal
the universal and eternal in the local and
fleeting. It is not the subject matter, but
the spirit informing it, that creates great
literature.
LOUIS ESSON.
A Satchel of Books
The Ginger-bee r Standard, by Isobel Jamieson
(Blackwood). This gives us no wearisome complexes.
It is a breezy, cheerful travel story in which two
English girls discover Malta. Their journey ends
in the way immortalised by Shakspeare.
The Black Parrot, by Harry Herboy (Thornton
Butterworth). An adventure story in which a girl
with the romantic name of Eliassa Camber goes
jaunting about the Pacific, and of course stumbles
on mystery, murder and true love. The author tells
his story well, with a fine sense of color and atmo-
sphere.
The Romantic Woman, by Mary Borden (Heine-
mann). The author of “Jane—Our Stranger” needs
no introduction to readers of fiction. In her new
work the authoress has penned nothing so hopeless
or heart-breaking as the story of the American girl
in the prison of a French marriage, but she has
given a story just as illusion-destroying. A strong
gift for characterisation and a poor estimate of human
motives are the foundations of the novel, which is
written with a hypnotic pen.
The Foundation and Settlement, o/ South Australia,
by A. Grenfell Price (Preece). Unlike Botany Bay,
Van Diemen’s Land, Moreton Bay, Port Phillip and
the Swan River Colon}-, South Aus. has not got a
past that has constrained her to murmur “Hush!”
when her maiden name is mentioned. Little Sister
of the South started with entirely respectable inten-
tions, which have been more or less fulfilled, and
A. Grenfell Pric e has set himself out to relate, explain
and expound the developments resulting from these
early desires to get on in life. He has done it
notably, and made a valuable contribution to the
story of Australian origins. It is not such a book
as Professor Wood’s “Discovery of Australia,’’ with
a grace and charm of its own, nor has it the
admirable terseness of Dunbabin’s “Making of Aus-
tralasia,” but it is clear, just and truthful, which
qualities place it on the same shelf as these two fine
volumes.
The Co-operative Union, of Manchester, is publish-
ing through Fisher Unwin, the lives of some great
co-operators, and Charles Kingsley, by W. Henry
Brown, is No. 4 of the series. It was the fashion
in cultured mid-Victorian circles to laugh at Kings-
ley as a futile visionary: his Christian Socialism,
his sympathy for Chartism, and, above all, his scorn
of Freetrade scandalised some of his best friends,
such as Froude. Yet Kingsley was perhaps the only
novelist who ever made the fortune of one of his
country towns (“Westward Ho!” transformed Bidc-
ford from an indigent hamlet into a prosperous
tourist resort), and all his sanitary, housing and
other social reforms are in operation now. The
truth is, Kingsley, while a poet and emotional and
occasionally illogical, as he showed during his con-
troversy with the cooler-headed Newman, was prac-
tical and far-sighted. A Kingsley thundering in
modern Australia against the clerical idea that
disease is a visitation of God might, vitalise the
campaign against V.D. single-handed.

PACKARD EIGHT SEVEN-PASSENGER TOURING CAR
What They Are and What They Mean
PACKARD ranks amongst the first six leading cars of the world. The new engineering principles which
have been built into the Packard Straight-Eight have brought it into a pre-eminent position amongst these
six cars. What are these principles and what do they result in ?
First of all
the Packard Straight-Eight differs in design from
all other eight-cylinder cars.
The re-adjustment of power distribution is entirely
a new feature. It is accomplished by a new com-
bination of cylinders and a new firing order that
brings the engine into perfect balance.
The Straight-Eight achieves a balance of power not
found in any twin-four or tandem-four.
They also include
an entirely new crankshaft design. There are nine
crankshaft bearings and the greatest distance be-
tween bearings does not exceed 2 3 A inches. The
Packard crankshaft is machined all over.
The crankshaft is dynamically and statically bal-
anced without the aid of counter-weights. The use
of counter-weights in a crankshaft is the line of least
resistance in overcoming a difficult problem. In the
Straight-Eight Packard has faced and successfully
overcome the problem of balance. The Straight-
Eight crankshaft is, therefore, perfect in design
and finish.
All the complications
of the V-Type motor have been eliminated and all
the simplicity of the Single-Six, companion car to
the Straight-Eight, retained.
The effect of these new principles
on the power flow is magical. It must be experi-
enced to be understood. It is so accessible that it
can only be compared to the steady flow of electric
current.
Combined with this smoothness in the silent flow
of a seemingly inexhaustable well of power there is
flexibility and ease of control which have practically
eliminated gear-change.
The Straight-Eight has been three years in develop-
ment and is based on Packard’s twenty-four years
of experience.
Whether or not you have previously been conscious
of Packard’s leadership in design, you cannot sense
the great advance which has been made in motor
cars until you have ridden in the Packard Straight-
Eight.

Southland and You.
The Hokunuis lift their heads above the
tussock lands,
The old Mataura runs its way through deep
and shallow sands ;
I hear the little wood-hen cheep as loud as
brazen bands —
Southland, Southland and you !
From where the waterfall goes down —I
hear its crashing still—
I see again the miller’s wheel, the grist that
feeds the mill,
And all the splashings echo back from each
remembered hill:
Southland, Southland and you !
But you and I will never see that tussock
land again ;
The troubled cities clamp us to their plea-
sures and their pain ;
But, oh, my love, for cattle-tracks where w T e
kissed in the rain—
Southland, Southland and you !
I see the old stars overhead, the stars we
knew as ours,
I tread again the valley path wherein clematis
flowers.
If God is in His Heaven, love, He’ll give
me back the hours
In Southland, Southland with, you!

Heath.
When all the wilderness of gums
Is tipped and splashed with lusty fires,
The happy bee beneath them hums
About a thousand slender spires.
Stiff little spires so thick with bells,
A very storm of sound must pass,
As the soft breeze exultant swells
Through the loose tangles of the grass.
Some are as white as though the flood
Had spun the foamy wreath they wear,
And some are red—l think the blood
Of some old ringer lingers there,
And throbbing, throbbing, swift and sweet,
Rings, by a breath of memory fanned,
With mounting chime and rhythmic beat,
Carillons out of Fairyland.
Though the storm hover like a wraith,
And loud the voice of winter ring,
Sure in the certainty of faith
They deck themselves to greet the Spring.
Nor ever know that she must die,
For, ere her flowery ranks are thinned,
They lay their early splendor by
And cast their bells upon the wind.

Song for Daisy.
Could I but meet and I but greet the Nut
Brown Maid,
I'd tease her pretty ringlets in a green,
clean glade;
And should she sing her ballad to me for a
tender while
In payment I should let her see my baby’s
smile.
Could I see Cleopatra I should pass her by—
Pass her by with laughter—and if she made
a sigh
Perhaps I’d deign to give the Queen herself
a quick command :
Of royal grace I’d let her kiss my child’s
Wee hand.
Could I speak with lovely Helen I should
surely say:
“You saw no fairer maiden in your own
brave day.”
And when she quite agreed with me, before
I let her go.
I’d whisper: “You may touch my baby's
pearl-pink toe.”
Oh, girls were rare and girls were fair iu
those old times;
But such as mine was never dreamed nor
sung about iu rhymes.
Titania and Mab, the wise, have told me
this themselves,
All dancing round her pillow with their light,
bright elves.

July Fog.
July has pitched her tent above the town,
A veil of mist; the cold white flap hangs
down,
And where last night the hills showed many
a vein
Of wattle gold, she makes a level plain;
So July spreads a fog about the world—
She drives the stakes and shows the tent
unfurled.
Then from the bay leaps up a lawless breeze.
It rolls the grey wmlls back against the
trees—
The flap is lifted. Deep on paler blue
The wooded slopes and rocky heights look
through.
A sheet of opal has the river found;
The w T et grass gathers moonstones from the
ground.
The Great Scene Shifter folds the tent away,
And through the rags of mist brings in the
day,
Pinning the cloud back with high chimney
stacks
From empty street, and green and tunnelled
tracks
And peddling Color brought from near and
far,
Till humble gardens blaze like a bazaar.
Building her fire in the open, we
See Gypsy Spring, bare in her blossomry.
Her brown eyes on a fragrant brew are
bent,
Warm-blooded August needs no covering tent!

PROPOSED RAILWAY TO DEADEND
SPRINGS.
The present Federal Government is this
much better than its predecessor—it often
gets half of a right idea, while the other
never failed to get the whole of a wrong
one, and to maul it till it became worse,
after which it was left unfinished. It couldn’t
buy a swan without the bird turning un-
accountably into a goose, and if it had a
cathedral half-built the stately pile would
transform itself into a dog-kennel. Thus
after years of brooding it really did a scrap
of work on the Soutli-to-North railway. It
began at the top end for no visible reason
save that labor was scarce and dear there,
and material had to be humped great dis-
tances by sea at vast expense. By working
from the northern end it provided that if
an enemy happened to seize Darwin while
the line was still unfinished he would have
facilities for penetrating further into the
interior, while the defence would have no
such extra facilities. Instead of tacking
the new bit of railway on to a live port it
was attached to one which has been killed
stone dead, and is in no way likely to revive
till the Avholc transcontinental route is fin-
ished. It perpetuated and extended the futile
narrow gauge, which meant that it did work
which will have to be undone and done over
again at no very distant date if the defence
of Australia is to be provided for in any
serious spirit. And it didn’t even profess
that its fragment was part of any definite
scheme, or that it was anything more than
a fragment and another dead end. The
whole thing represented the Triumph of
Botch. The present Government is not all
that could be desired, but at least it isn’t pure
harlequin. It recognises that the biggest
Federal line should be of the uniform Federal
gauge, and not a thin freak, and it proposes
to act accordingly. It suggests working
from the south end, where labor is fairly
abundant, where there are factories to pro-
duce the necessary materials, and where the
railway can take them to the front at mini-
mum cost. This means invading the Terri-
tory from its lion-tropical end, and when
uninformed visitors can approach that way
they will learn that the ticrra caliente at
and near Darwin, instead of being the entire
show, is an almost inconsiderable item there-
of. It also means the extinction of a bogey
which has blocked progress for years, and
under the regime of a perpetual Hughes
might have blocked it for ever. That wily
vote-liunter never ventured to carry his work
beyond a point where the route was an open
question—never went so far that he must
either commit himself to a shameful breach
of faith with S. Australia or bid defiance to
Theodore and his friends, who schemed to
get the line for the benefit of West Queens-
land. If the railway once reaches Alice
►Springs from the south the route is settled.
* * * *
Yet something is lacking. The present
talk is of extending the rails to the Mac-
donnell Ranges and Alice Springs, the centre
town of the continent. But there, it would
seem, another period of indefinite repose is
liable to set in. Even the resumption of
work to that extent is only suggested as the
price at which S. Australia may consent to
the construction of a Federal standard-gauge
line across its land from Port Augusta to the
N.S.W. border, whence it will proceed via
Hay to Sydney. This undertaking will
facilitate the delivery of the English invoice
and the bill of lading for imported goods at
the Ma State capital, and may be some aid
to defence. It will cost a heap of money,
but it won’t open up any desirable- part of
empty Australia to population. Tagged on
to it are projects for spending much more
Federal money on a Sydney-Brisbane rail-
way connection, and a third lot on standard-
ising the Kalgoorlie-Perth section in West-
ralia —by way of a reward to the big State,
presumably, for breaking its promise to do
the work itself. It would appear as if the
Bruce-Page Ministry considers these odd
jobs in the well-settled South-East, where the
solid voting power lies, as the essentials, and
the pioneering work in its own territory, to
which its honor is pledged, as a side-sliow.
Something is wrong with its perspective.
A shrewd bargaining Premier at Adelaide
would demand prompt delivery of the com-
plete South-to-North railway as the price of
the concessions for which the Commonwealth
fishes so hard, and thereby would leave a
margin for haggling. Further, an even
moderately suspicious Premier would demand
that the rails should reach Alice Springs
before the first sod of the Port Augusta-Hay
work is turned; and he might even ask for
hostages or a cash deposit. This would not
be through any doubt of the present Govern-
ment’s integrity, for the Prime Minister’s
spats are in themselves sufficient evidence of
the spotless purity of his intentions. It
would be merely lest the old shilly-shally
gang should climb back to office, and the
old deviation conspiracy be revived, and the
whole question go back into the melting-pot.
Any precaution which would tend to prevent
that would be justified, for the making of the
short, straight road across Australia isi part
of the defence question, and the two which
are one constitute by far the biggest matter
in Australian politics. The Canberra capi-
tal is nothing by comparison, despite any
rich landed interests that may be involved.
The fad for building enormously expensive
cargo steamers which mostly loaf in harbor
can stand over indefinitely—perhaps the
longer it stands the better. It would be
worth while to sell the Commonwealth’s
whole mercantile fleet, and Australia House
in London to boot, in order to help the good
cause alone.
The South and South-East have a
railway system of a sort which extends
from Geraldton (W.A.) to Brisbane and be-
yond. They have an alternative sea route,
reasonably well furnished with ships. They
contain the bulk of the population, and there
are sufficient British interests there to give
somebody outside a lively interest in their
fate. The North, away from the Queens-
land railways, has hardly enough inhabitants
left to form a quorum. The scrap of toy
railway produces no results because it leads
nowhere. When the coastal shipping is
mobilised on an emergency it proves to con-
sist of the John Alec, the absent-minded Gov-
ernment craft of 30 tons which forgot for
half a year to carry stores to the forlorn
settlers at Borraloola, and the auxiliary oil-
drum ketch Huddersfield, which was last seen
proceeding on a mission of life and death at
the rate of one knot. Any Court of compe-
tent jurisdiction would hardly hesitate to
decide that everything the other side of a
line drawn from about Cloncurry (Q.) to about
Northampton (W.A.) had reverted to the
condition of waste land and was open for
selection. Any Ramsay Macdoodee of in-
competent jurisdiction would probably think
the matter not worth arguing about. The
waste-land question of the world at large is,
almost to a certainty, about to enter on an
acute phase. Emigration to the United
States had reached 1,218,000 in 1914. and it
was growing so fast that it should have
reached 2,000,000 but for the falling of the
bottom out of things at the end of July.
Resumption on an even larger scale was
looked for with the return of peace, but a
succession of panicky restriction law's has
reduced the number of possible entrants to
(it is reckoned) some 100,000 or less.
Canada is an outlet of strictly limited nossi-
bilities. One-third of it—the bleak North-
West, where Stefansson located his fabled
land of New North Canaan —is being aban-
doned so fast that the population dropped
from 20,000 to 8000 inside 20 years, and the
weather is regarded as full and sufficient
justification. Brazil and Argentina are both
filling up. and both beginning to grow par-
ticular about their guests. In consequence
of these and other matters, unsettled, unrail-
wayed and deserted Australia is likely to
attract more comment in the future than in
the past. If we want to keep the continent
for ourselves and the white British race, on
present appearances we haven’t got all the
future in which to dawdle at Deadend
Springs.
AFTER THE FIRE.
When a great fire sweeps the bush the deso-
lation rarely lasts beyond the first fall of
rain. Among the heaps of ashes and char-
coal seedlings appear; and soon the tufted
heads of wattle and a hundred broom-like
shrubs are waving over the ground where
the great trees died. All these green things
have developed from seed long fallen, seed
of amazing vitality and thick, protective
husk, which only the intense heat of the fire
could cause to germinate; and all of them
are engaged in the work of cultivation, add-
ing stores of nitrogen to an impoverished
soil. The people who chose the wattle for
Australia’s emblem may have made a poor
artistic choice, but as a sign the tree has
its significance. It stands always for help
and kindly labor; the whole forest benefits
from every forward run of the roots. It gathers
plant-food from the atmosphere and places
it deep in the soil where the big gum-
trees may find it in after years. Its
branches afford shelter for the young gum
seedlings; and when its brave work is
done it falls at its post of duty and
leaves the land to the strong timber trees it
nursed in their infancy. Then its hard seeds
lie in the ground and wait for years, ready
to come to the rescue again after the next
fire. There is no finer instance of co-opera-
tion in nature than the work done by the
leguminous plants and shrubs; even the
desert-pea, with its fiery blossoms, is striv-
ing to reclaim the sandy wastes.
* * * 4fr
When the terrible fire of war sweeps lands
and peoples, a similar miracle is wrought in
the human soil. Seeds of fine emotion which
have lain dormant through the years of peace
break their hard shell and begin anew the
work of preparing the nations for the greater
growths of human progress. It has gen-
erally been the case that while the
ink was still wet on the peace treaties,
hands of friendship and understanding
have been reached across the ‘ fron-
tiers. Waves of goodwill have radiated
from old centres of hate; and the bitter
things once said are remembered only as
amusing falsehoods. The Crimean W T ar was
a case in point. After all the heat and
fury of camnaigns disastrous to both sides,
England and Russia almost fell upon each
other’s neck. Men of both nations discovered
how like they were to one another. The
Czar showered compliments upon all that
was left of the Light Brigade; London saw
something fine in everything that came from
Russia. It seemed as if the dreadful days
in the trenches before Sebastopol had been
almost worth while, with such a sequel of
friendship. Similarly, after the South Afri-
can War, the British and Boers discovered
virtues in their late foemen which they had
formerly refused to recognise. Britain fol-
lowed the long and tedious work of slaughter
and destruction by large acts of goodwill.
The defeated Boers were not only given poli-
tical charge of the Transvaal and the Orange
State, but had all the rest of South Africa
entrusted to them. Botha and Smuts held
in turn a dignity twice as great as that of
Ivbugek, and taught their people to cheer for
the flag that had lately waved over their
humiliation. In both the quoted instances
good seed of human kindliness germinated
amid the ruins left by war, seed of plants
that blossomed bravely in their day and
stored food of good understanding for the
future.
* * * *
But since the close of the Great War
there has been little sign of the breaking of
such seed through the European soil. It was
as if that terrible fire had burned the earth
deep and destroyed the last germ of a better
hope. That, too, has sometimes happened
in limited areas after a severe bush fire in
time of drought. The merciful wattle-seeds
and others of their kind have died entirely
in the deeply scorched soil, and left a deso-
lation that only the creeping years could
cover again with green. Perhaps it once
happened in an almost unlimited area; for
no one knows the story of the passing of the
great forest that once ran from the Darling
to Lake Eyre. Certainly the war burned
very deep into the hearts of men and nations.
There has been no sign of forgiveness; good-
will even among the victorious Allies has been
little more than a name. When the soil be-
comes barren, its nitrogen exhausted, and the
co-operation of Nature for its restoration
fails, the only way in which it can be re-
stored is by artificially simulating the work
of Nature. A leguminous crop deeply turned
in with the plough will work the needed
change. Something of the kind appears to
be required in Europe. So close to the verge
of ruin has the world been brought that all
private animosity and lingering bitterness
works towards a final catastrophe too ter-
rible to contemplate. It is no longer wholly
a question of what Germany deserves or
what France is entitled to, but of what is
best for the British, French or German child
who is to carry on the world’s civilisation
to the future years. Only a deliberate sow-
ing of goodwill can save the impoverished
human soil. It may not be possible for a
Frenchman to feel well disposed to a Ger-
man or for a German to love a Belgian; but
it is possible for every nation to set a stand-
ard of kindly conduct which in the end must
fertilise the devastated fields. Possibly, in
spite of all criticism, the British and Drench
Ministers have seen that, and the first fur-
rows have even now been turned j»ind the first
seeds of better things sown broadcast against
a wind of hate.
JUTLAND.
Naval opinion about Jutland is divided
into two groups. One group served directly
under Beatty in the Battle Cruisers and
the other served under Jeleicoe in the
Battle Fleet, the two together comprising
the Grand Fleet. Jeleicoe made the Grand
Fleet; Beatty finally reaped the credit..
Yet when Beatty took over lie did not find
it necessary to alter a line of Jellicoe’s
battle and manoeuvring orders. They were
certainly altered as time went on, but the
alterations were only to conform wfitk the
progress made in matters of detail, i.e., by
reason of new inventions, in new ways of
doing old things, in a new method of inter-
ship communication for Fleet fire-control
purposes, and in other things which would
have developed just the same under Jel-
licoe. The new method of fire-control was
indeed the result of an idea conceived and
experimented with by an ordinary watch-
keeping officer in one of the battleships;
yet Beatty’s officers got the credit for it.
I shall never forget the day the Iron
Duke, then the Fleet flagship, returned to
Scapa Flow with Beatty’s flag flving in-
stead of Jellicoe’s. It was one of those
few sunny, windless days in which the
Orkneys indulge in early autumn, and I
was walking up and down the quarterdeck
with our skipper, one of the soundest,
cleverest and most conscientious men who
ever commanded a man-of-war. As the
Iron Duke passed the ship’s company were
called to attention, and the officers saluted
the new C.-in-C. When that formality was
concluded the skipper stood looking after
the Iron Duke for a moment or two ; then he
turned to me and said, “Good God, what’s
going to happen now!” We all anticipated
that as soon as the Fleet flagship’s anchor
was down the signal would be made to
raise steam, and that next day we should
find ourselves bombarding Heligoland or
carrying out some such foolhardy venture
of the swashbuckling, blood-and-fire type,
whose only result could be an expenditure
of much ammunition and an unjustified
risk to the Fleet which stood between civil-
isation and chaos. But it didn’t happen,
and the Grand Fleet’s opinion of Beatty
went up when it was realised that spec-
tacular ventures were not to be the order
of the day, and that Jellicoe’s policy of
reserving the Fleet till it was called upon
to perform its principal function of engag-
ing the enemy’s fleet was to be continued.
But to come back to Jutland and the
famous turn away from the enemy. No
doubt if Jellicoe had risked the torpedo
attack we should have lost some ships but.
sunk most of the German Fleet. What
Jellicoe had to decide in the most critical
moment—in fact, the most supremely criti-
cal instant —in the world’s history, was
whether he should take a risk which would
have dangerously imperilled every ship in
the Grand Fleet, or be satisfied with the
damage already done to the enemy, which
he considered and which was afterwards
proved to have been enough. No one not in
Jelltcoe’s position has any right to utter
the vaguest hostile criticism of the man
who, having done enough, was content to
refuse a possibly small risk, the taking of
which would in all probability have meant
that Nelson would have been forgotten
and Jellicoe placed on his column in Tra
falgar-square. But was the submarine risk
small? Even as it was, the ship in which
I was serving had to put her helm hard over
to avoid one torpedo which could be seen
Coming straight at us, and the same move-
ment of the helm swung our stern away
from another which had not been seen till
the last moment. We cleared the one ahead
by about 10 yards and the one astern by
apparently 20. About the same time the
Marlborough was hit and put out of action.
The experience of other ships in our vicinity
was much the same, and was quite suffi-
cient to justify an assessment of the risk
as very great indeed.
Jellicoe’s method of deployment into
single line is supposed to have been wrong.
To understand what is meant, let those
who know Sydney Harbor imagine the head
of the enemy’s fleet to have been at Ivirri-
billi steering towards Circular Quay, and
let them imagine the British Fleet to have
been steaming up the harbor in six divisions
whose leaders were abeam of each other.
If our starboard column —the one nearest
the north shore—had gone ahead to lead
the line, it would have passed between the
enemy and the whole of the remainder of
the British Fleet, which could not have fired
a gun till the starboard column was clear.
The same would have happened with suc-
cessive columns as they prepared to fall
into line astern of the starboard column.
Deployment on the port column, on the other
hand, meant that only the last ship or two
in each of our columns would have had
its fire “blanketed,” and that only for a
rapidly-diminishing period of time. On the
other hand, deployment to starboard meant
that the range would have been less than
in the ease of a deployment to port; but
this factor should not have affected the
situation much, as the range would have
been a maximum of 18,000 yards in the
most unfavorable case, and that range is
nothing very out of the ordinary. As it
was, the ship in which I was serving opened
fire with only 10,000 yards on her sights.
In this respect it was the rapidly-thicken-
ing mist that hampered us. The battle
cruisers had been in action in clear weather,
and further north there had not been much
fog; but just where the fleets met the visi-
bility was not over 10,000 yards. It was
a piece of colossal bad luck but for which
we would never have heard a criticism about
Jellicoe’s deployment.
Much discussion has raged around
Beatty’s famous signal. It is interesting
to consider exactly what the signal was. In
my ship I decoded it myself, and I remem-
ber it well, “If the King George Y. will
now follow me we can cut off the whole
German Fleet.” The K.G.V. was leading
our line, and Beatty’s signal in effect meant
that Jellicoe was to hand over the con-
duct of the action to Beatty. By the
time the latter made his signal Jel-
ltcoe’s intention not to risk the torpedo
attack was apparent. If Beatty’s sugges-
tion had been acted upon the fleet might
have been lost and Jellicoe, not Beatty,
would have been held responsible. Beatty
could have got out of it by saying he did
not realise exactly how the battle fleet was
situated with regard to the enemy tornedo
attack, and that Jellicoe should not have
acted on a mere suggestion. If a smashing
victory had resulted the major portion of
the credit would have gone to Beatty for his
suggestion. If Jellicoe refused to act on
the suggestion. Beatty could always say
that if his advice had been taken things
would have been different. That, indeed, is
what the Beattyites are saying now. \Y hat-
ever was dorx Beatty stood to lose nothing
and gain all the credit, and he put his chief
in an impossible situation. Jellicoe re-
fused an odds-on chance of covering himself


with glory, and by refusing to be stampeded
into taking a risk lie displayed a moral cour-
age which was sublime to the last degree.
It was stated recently that Beatty is the
only prominent commander who has not writ-
ten a book about his part in the war. It
was, however, generally understood in the
service that the proofs of A. H. Pollen’s
“The Navy in Battle” were read by him.
During the current controversy inspired
by Yon Scheer’s book it has also been
stated that the lack of a smashing victory
at Jutland prolonged the war by two years,
and made the submarine war possible. As
the German Fleet never moved after Jut-
land. the argument is hard to follow; it was
because the German Fleet was impotent that
submarine warfare was intensified to make
up for it.
The Jutland controversy will never cease,
unfortunately; but let the critics always re-
member that on Jellicoe rested the respon-
sibility for a decision which, if wrongly
made, would have destroyed our civilisation.
Let them also remember that our civilisation
is intact.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Stricken Industries.
In the course of his Budget speech Dr.
Page mentioned that a sum of £154,000 had
been placed on this year’s estimates “to meet
the remaining losses on the canned-fruit
pools.” There were three of these canned-
fruit pools (Hughes was responsible in the
first place, and Page is attending to the
funeral), and it has cost the taxpayer
£643,000 to get rid of produce which the
Government, in the capacity of philanthro-
pic purchaser, valued at £336,952 in the
raw state, that being the amount paid to
the growers. The canners’ share of the
disbursements totalled £943,211, or
£1,280,163 altogether; in effect, the Govern-
ment spent 50 p.c. of the value of the output
for three years on an attempt to “stabilise
the industry” by “relieving growers and
canners of all responsibility for the pur-
chase and sale of the fruit,” in which at-
tempt, as the Treasurer admits, it failed.
Since the pooling system was abandoned the
canners have been receiving bounties condi-
tionally on their paying an approved mini-
mum price for all the f.a.q. fruit sent to the
factories and turning out an article up to
the export standard. The growers of cur-
rants and raisins, most of whom are returned
soldiers, are also to be helped by the Com-
monwealth Government, being in a bad way.
Until the 1922 season 80 p.c. of the dried-
fruit pack was consumed in Australia; now,
the soldier-settlements having reached the
producing stage, 80 p.c. has to be exported,
and ‘‘unfortunately,” as the Prime Minister
puts it, “the export last year and this sea-
son was conducted at a loss.” In point of
fact, “the dried-fruit industry is now more
dependent upon overseas markets than any
other Australian industry except wool,” and
owing to the disappointing results of London
•sales “some of the commercial houses which
financed the producers have felt themselves
forced to discontinue advances.” The Gov-
ernment has, therefore, undertaken to lend
the raisin-grower 30s. per ton per month and
the currant-cultivator ss. p.t. p.m., the
advance to be based on the applicant’s
export quota in 1924; but already the cry
has been heard that the industry is in a
condition so desperate that it will have to
be helped a lot more. There is also to be
a bonus of 4s. a gallon on exported sweet
wine, and the bounty of 10s. per head on
exported cattle has been renewed, and the.
distressed dairy-farmer and the apple-grower
are to be financially assisted also. Refer-
ring to these and other pathetic appeals for
help from the “primary” industries on which,
according to demented Foreign-traders, the
nation is living, the Prime Minister declares
that “Australia has devoted too much
thought to production in comparison with
the efforts made to obtain efficient disposal
of the produce.” What should be said is
that the rabble of politicians who have had
the ordering of land-settlement schemes,
especially since the soldiers came home, have
concentrated on the wrong sort of produc-
tion, and left the Australian market out
of their calculations, if they ever made
any. Had the energies expended on growing
things for over-supplied foreign markets,
there to be sold at a loss, been directed on an
intelligent plan towards satisfying the re-
quirements of the home market, the position
which Bruce deplores, and which is multi-
plying his worries and those of the tax-
payer, would never have arisen. While
thousands of splendid settlers have been re-
duced to pitiful straits as a result of over-
production, a huge import business is done
in agricultural produce and foodstuffs of
vegetable origin, every pound of which could
be grown in the country. Tobacco, for in-
stance. Last year the unmanufactured to-
bacco that came into the country was valued
at £2,854,598; it was actually worth £6755
more than the gold sent away. In the pre-
Federation days there was quite a brisk little
tobacco-growing industry until Freetrade got
in its deadly work; and now that the situa-
tion has changed, inasmuch as Protection
bas become the settled policy of the nation,
and the manufacturers are professedly willing
not only to pay a decent price for local
w'eed but to show the cultivator how to
prepare the leaf, Australia should be produc-
ing at least as much tobacco as S’Africa,
instead of buying from that country. Tea
aag AAn Se ™l )or ted to the extent of
±0,0U0,000 p.a. (last year’s purchases were
worth £381,000 more than the exports of beef,
iamb, mutton and copper combined) ; yet
Asiatic tea could he grown in Northern Aus-
tralia and the Paraguayan yer~ba mate
(which the Westralian Government talks of
introducing) in the South. There are like-
wise extensive imports of coffee, rice—a 54-
bushel crop of padi has been obtained on
the Yanco (N.S.W.) experimental farm—
maize, hops,, linseed, dates and the like, in
the cultrvation of Avhich thousands of re-
turned soldiers, now starved out or broken-
•p+l JJ'bght have been profitably engaged
it the authors of the six ruinous repatriation
schemes hadn t been blind to everything but
wheat cows and fruit. The best hope for
industries of the soil is the substitution of
Commonwealth for State control. In that
case there would at least be a chance of
their being organised and developed on a
national plan; there is none now.

Airships and Defence.
“If Australia were going to meet an invasion it
would need more than one or two battleships to meet
a hostile fleet. Those two battleships would only be
a target for such a fleet, and when they were sunk
the country would be without a fleet.” — -Pemberton
Billing, ex-M.P. at Sydney National Club.
This is an example of the familiar contro-
versial device of setting’ up a dummy for the
pleasure of knocking it down again. But
why the speaker—who is, or was, interested
in the aircraft business, and who was seek-
ing to prove that Australia should invest in
£20,000,000 worth of aeroplanes and abandon
naval defence —stopped at the point he did
in his fantastic argument is a puzzle. Aus-
tralia has never owned a battleship, and
under the terms of the Washington agree-
ment cannot now begin building one, while
her only battle cruiser lies in deep water off
Sydney Heads. Her cruisers are obsolete.
Japan, which, though friendly now, may one
day be the enemy of this rich and under-
manned continent, has, on the other hand,
10 battleships and battle cruisers, 17 cruisers
and light cruisers and a complementary fleet
of destroyers, submarines, aircraft-carriers
and the rest. The Commonwealth, is, there-
fore, Japan’s for the taking: all that nation
need do is to come here and settle down.
But other considerations govern such enter-
prises. The R.A.N. is, in effect, part of
the British Navy, which outnumbers that of
Japan by two to one in battleships and battle
cruisers, and by three to one in cruisers and
light, cruisers. In short, the R.A.N. is in a
position analogous to that of the A.I.F.
during its sheltered days at Mepa before the
Gallipoli landing. It exists by virtue of the big
battalions behind it—and so does Australia.
The British themselves place small faith in
air defence, though the danger of attack from
the air is immeasurably greater in their case
than in ours. Mr. Pemberton Billing’s
preposterous claim that “England has to-day
a torpedo-carrying aeroplane fleet 2000
strong” is routed by the facts and figures in
the last Air Estimates. In Februai’y last
Britain had only 100 first-line ’planes and
an independent striking force of 80—less
than a tenth of the French force. Though
casual about air defence, however, Britain
is as enthusiastic as ever about the navy,
and more particularly about the value of the
capital ship. On the latter issue all the great
British sailors with modern active-service ex-
perience—Jelltcoe, Beatty, Sturdee, Field,
Phillimore, Madden, Cowan —'are solid. In
the recently-cabled words of Admiral de Roe-
beck :—-
If in 1914 the appliances now used had been
available battleships would have been 75 to 80 per
cent, stronger, and there was now no question of
their indispensability.
If during the World War Mr. Pemberton
Billing had arrived at General Monash’s
headquarters, and suggested that the A.I.F.
should cut out its heavy and field artillery
and rely on some cheaper device, he would
have been disregarded, to put it mildly. If
his theories had been considered worthy of
a reply, he would have been told that the
whole military talent of Britain favored
these weapons, and that in any event the.
A.I.F. was merely a part of the Imperial
whole, and hence unable to strike out with
battle experiments of its own. The Com-
monwealth is in precisely that position with
regard to sea-defence. If the British Navy
failed, not all the aeroplanes of Mr. Bil-
ling’s wildest dreams would save Australia
as a white man’s country. While it com-
mands the seas, the Commonwealth’s national
life is safe. This does not disparage the air-
ship as an auxiliary; but while strengthen-
ing that arm, our chief duty is to pay
our share of the naval bill, and work to-
wards the provision of a dock capable of
accommodating a battleship.

A Blot and a Bill.
Approximately 20,000 insane persons are
detained in institutions in the Common-
wealth. The Year Book lumps orphans and
the inmates of industrial schools and re-
formatories together, and it is difficult to
discover what proportion of these children
are segregated because they have been un-
fortunate and what proportion are definitely
feeble-minded. Omitting the orphans, and
adopting the American investigators’ judg-
ment that between 25 and 50 per cent, of
reformatory children are mentally deficient,
we may safely conclude that there are 7000
feeble-minded children segregated in these
other institutions. The American psycholo-
gists discovered that, in a population from
which the dangerously-insane had been re-
moved, at least 2 per cent, of the remainder
were definitely feeble-minded. Investigations
in Australia tend to confirm this estimate.
This means that there are approximately
100,000 persons in the Commonwealth who
are, or at maturity will be, incapable of
managing their own affairs with ordinary
prudence and who have not those restraints
and that sense of shame which prevent their
more normal fellows from getting into
trouble. It would be pleasant if we could
say: “These people are not likely to do
much harm to any but themselves; let them
alone until they become troublesome.” Here,
however, the unpleasant facts of heredity
step in. These deficients are, as a rule,
strongly sexed and lack self-control; the
woman is likely to leave the taint be-
hind her in more offspring than will bless
(or otherwise) the woman of average intel-
ligence. In more primitive times drink, disease
and want carried off a far larger proportion
of the feeble-minded than of the normal,
but our more careful organisation tends to
protect the weak from the ravages of plague
and poverty. All this points towards the
conclusion that the undesirable are multiply-
ing at a very much higher rate than the
desirable. They tried sterilisation in one at
least of the United States, and some thou-
sands of mentally-deficient people had been
dealt with before the Federal Government
ordered the practice to cease. It is indeed
not easy to imagine any civilised community
prepared to bruise its sensibilities to the
extent of allowing this solution of the
problem. That being so, the only immedi-
ately practicable course is segregation—keep
them alive, make them as happy as possible,
but, above all, keep them where they will not
be able to propagate their kind. It will cost
money, but it will save more. The time when
Governments will be prepared to spend one
pound to save two still seems remote. At
present the States spend £1,500,000 upon the
segregation of the insane. Much more than
than that will be needed if any comprehen-
sive scheme is to be carried out. But there
is another side to the question. At least a
quarter, perhaps a half, of the criminals in
the community, for whom exists an elaborate
and expensive system of courts, police and
gaols, are afflicted with inherited feeble-
mindedness which could have been dis-
covered during their adolescence by a
perfectly practicable scheme of psycho-
logical testing during the school period.
A little more care before the occur-
rence of the much-too-frequent sexual crimes
that are committed in Sydney and Melbourne
could be well substituted for the futile out-
bursts of disgust and indignation that follow
the event.

The Machinery of Government.
Sydney Telegraph has started a reform,
movement which is meeting with the vague
goodwill usually accorded to honest attempts
to deal with admitted scandals. After con-
sideration of the ineptitude and larrikin
rowdiness of successive N. S. Wales Parlia-
ments, the paper has come to the conclusion
that the ouly cure is once more to reduce the
membership and increase the emoluments. A
number of prominent politicians and Party
bosses have been interviewed and have
acclaimed the scheme. Their enthusiasm —so
different from the tired acquiescence of the
disillusioned taxpayer who participates in
the political game only every three years or
so—is one measure of the futility of the pro-
posal. A decrease in the number of members
of an elective House —accompanied, or other-
wise, by abolition of the nominee chamber—
does not mean that the power of the Party
machines will be diminished. The safe seats
will be allocated by some form of pre-selec-
tion (faked in many cases by the power of
the cheque-book or the sliding panel, as in
the past) to faithful old Party retainers
after the existing fashion; and as the faith-
ful die off, or are rewarded for past services
with Agent-Generalships, High Commis-
sionerships and other sinecures, their places
will be filled by younger, but no less pliant,
men. As for increased salaries, experience
has shown that they do not even mean
that the recipients are materially enriched:
Federal M’s.P. claim that they arc no better
off than their less generously remunerated
State brethren, mainly because they have
more constituents to rook or blackmail them.
An essentia] if Parliaments are to do
better work is the introduction of Elective
Ministries. Modern government is an art at
least as complicated as engine-driving or hat-
making, and anyone can see the absurdity
of giving a man control of a train or a lead-
ing position in a hat-factory because he can
talk fluently, or is a Methodist or an R. 0., or
comes from a country district. The forma-
tion of Ministries on a basis of merit would
be accompanied logically by the Recall. Go-
ing a step further in any inquiry into the
failure of Parliaments, it will be found that
a contributing cause of the offensive conduct
by which far too much of the time of mem-
bers is wasted is that disastrous importation,
the all-night sitting. At its inception in
England few members and no Ministers did
any serious work during the day. Like the
London of Le Gallienne’s poem, their “day
began when day was done.” In Australia a
Treasurer may be the active head of an
importing firm and a Minister for Mines a
busy land-agent during the daylight hours,
while the majority of the rank and file will
be unemployed throughout the same period
only by compulsion. In the industrial world
we have long since got away from the theories
of those who opposed the Factory Act of
1833 with the argument that it was good
for people to work till they dropped. We
realise that the normal man can only give of
his best, whether physically or mentally,
over a comparatively short period—eight
hours in the case of manual workers and
much less in that of, say, judges. Only where
the work of the nation is done for it in the
most responsible institution in the land do
we hark back to a theory that was discarded
contemptuously by the guildsmen of the
Middle Ages—that man is capable of work-
ing most of the night after working most
of the day.
♦
Curing the Desert.
Concerning The Bulletin’s pet mission:
Australia possesses a mission which is performing
a national work on a plan more long-sighted than
the National Parliament seems capable of either
making or adopting. Its chief prophet is John
Flynn —the Rev. J. Flynn, if you like —six-feet-three
of enthusiasm and national spirit. Fifteen years ago,
when a theological student of the Scots Kirk, he
talked about using flying-machines to supply medical
attendance to people in the Far Outback, and was
laughed at as a visionary; to-day the Australian
Inland Mission is turning his dreams into a definite
programme of high importance.
So far the mission spends its entire revenue upon
supplying nurses and hospital accommodation in the
Never Never. Flynn’s idea, (and that of the mission )
is this. The safety of Australia demands that settle
ment shall creep northward; people will not remain
settled where women of their own race cannot live;
white women, potential mothers, cannot live —at any
rate, should not be asked to live—where there are
no doctors, nurses or hospitals to look after them.
The mission is therefore concentrating upon the
establishment of nursing stations, and is doing more to
really settle the waste spaces of Australia than
any Government has done for many long years.
The hospital at Victoria River Downs was estab-
lished in May, 1922. It is 200 miles from the nearest
telephone. During the 1921 stock season 11 men
died from malaria on the Victoria River track:
since the hospital was established there has not been
a death; and babies have been bom on a station down
the track where formerly there were only male
inhabitants.
The mission has so far established seven hospitals.
There is one at Port Hedland, on the nor’-west
coast of W.A.; another is at Hall’s Creek, in
the uttermost North-West; others are at Victoria
River Downs and Maranboy (N.T.), Birdsville (Q.),
Oodnadatta and Beltana (S.A.). Each is fully
equipped and has two nurses, and every nurse has
the double certificate—for obstetrics and general
nursing—is capable, on necessity, of performing opera-
tions, and is working on a two years’ agreement. In
addition, there is a “district” nurse at Innamincka
(S.A.). The hospitals are entirely non-sectarian. The
only advantage the mission hopes to reap on the
soul-saving side is that the practical humanity of
its work may give some of the unreligious a better
idea of Christianity.
The hospitals are established on the condition
that they can be handed over to a local committee at
any time, the only proviso being that the committee
will then repay the capital cost of the hospital, so
that the mission may have the means to push still
further out and establish a new hospital; and the
good Loan knows there is plenty of scope. It is
970 miles between hospitals going north to Darwin
From Birdsville it is 240 miles to the nearest tele-
phone, and another 150 miles to the doctor at Clon-
curry. There is a woman at Wickcliffe Well who is
550 miles from the nearest doctor at Oodnadatta,
64 miles from the closest neighbor, and separated
from the nearest white woman by 170 miles.
The mission’s hopes do not end with filling these
gaps. It aims also to supply medical assistance by
aeroplane. On its map of Australia are ten centres
from which circles are drawn with a uniform radius
of 250 miles. Each of the spots marks the station
where a unit will be established with full aeroplane
outfit—-when the mission has the means to do - it.
When he was Prime Minister, W. M. Hughes pro-
mised that the Government would supply a ’plane for
the first station. It hasn’t arrived yet. When those
10 stations are equipped,, practically the whole
Never Never will be covered.
Before the Hall’s Creek hospital was established, a
man there met with a bad accident, and a frantic
postmaster wired through to Perth for advice. The
doctor told him he would have to perform an opera-
tion. When he protested that he had no instruments,
the doctor answered: “You’ve got a razor, I suppose;
the man will die if you don’t use it. If you operate
it will give him a chance.” The doctor, 1500 miles
away, gave directions over the wire to the postmaster,
and he grittily performed a distasteful task. The
patient lived eight days, and his life would certainly
have been saved if he had had proper nursing. That
was something which no untrained man could give.
In April, 1922, a woman in the south-western end
of the N.T. gave birth to a child in a creek bed, where
her husband had made her as comfortable as possible
■whilst he went to seek assistance 30 miles away.
She was nursing the infant when he returned. A
letter recently received from Maranboy Downs station
said that a fracture case was expected; the unfortu-
nate man was being brought in on a buck-board and
would arrive in ten days. In the country of long
distances, where such things as these occur, the
human and national value of the work the Inland
Mission has undertaken is incalculable.

Prostituting the Police Force.
Certain unpleasant police methods of get-
ting convictions against sly-grog sellers were
ventilated at Prahran (Vic.) Court the other
day. Two constables arrived at the place
where it was intended that the majesty of the
law should be vindicated with “a couple of
women whose Christian names were Mary
and Jessie.” That, according to the evi-
dence, was all the ladies’ escorts
knew about them. The four remained
on the premises “from 10.30 p.m.
until about midnight,” when a fight
occurred between the women, one of
whom was admittedly drunk, and the party
left in a taxi. In Sydney the Paddington
S.M. considered the case of a wine-seller
who had been visited by two women. They
represented themselves as prostitutes who ex-
pected to be entertaining “gentlemen friends”
at their flat that night, and invited him to
produce drink. He did so, and subsequently
found that the women were police pimps
and their friends constables. A distinguish-
ing feature of all these cases is the zest with
which the police enter upon their parts as
provocative agents. Certain Sydney con-
stables (one of whom admitted that he was
required to lie in pursuit of his duties) have
been accustomed to spend long periods in
revelry at restaurants before making their
spring. They, too, crusade in the name of
law and order with females of _ remark-
ably unconventional habits, and in conse-
quence their evidence is usually swallowed
with a wry face by magistrates—not that it
i.s doubted, but, in the phrase of the Prahran
P.M., “for its effect on the public mind.”
Unless the police of Australia are to degen-
erate, in the estimation of the community,
to the level of New York’s patrolmen under
the regime of Richard Croker and his Tam-
many predecessors, the authorities will have
to transfer them to more Spartan (and, in-
cidentally, less flagrantly illegal) duties. Jus-
tice James, of N. S. Wales, during argument
in the Usher’s and Hotel Australia cases,
stated the sense and equity as well as the
law of the matter:—
Where there is a deliberate attempt by a person
to cause another to do something legally wrong the
person who makes the attempt is a participator in
the breaking of - the law.
Yet there is a direction in which agents provo -
cateurs might advantageously be employed. At
present it is not safe for an old, crippled or
apparently inebriated man to walk at night
in many of the streets, or in any of the
parks of Melbourne or Sydney. A constable
capable of giving half as good an imitation
of an incapacitated man of fashion as some
of them have been providing of the same type
while in process of becoming incapacitated,
could not fail to secure the attention of a
thug, if the performance was staged in the
right place. The remainder, the arrest of
the would-be robber and potential assassin,
ought to be child’s play to an armed constable
with authorisation to shoot if resisted. A
few such performances would raise the pres-
tige of the police instead of lowering it, and
would quickly show results in the way of
diminishing crimes of violence.

The Horse-breeding Business.
During the debate on the Horse-breeding
Bill in the N. S, Wales Assembly, W. J.
Sculey, who as a backblocks M.L.A. should
have known better, made a remark which is
often heard in cities: —
The horse-breeding industry is dying in this
and other States, and, in fact, throughout the world,
owing to the introduction of motor traction.
His refutation came in the form of an Argus
item a few days later: —
The Government of India requires 2800 cavalry
horses, and Captain G. M. Hutton, of the Remount
department (India), has been sent to Australia to
make the purchases. The horses will be shipped for
India during October and November. Captain Hut-
ton has been directed to purchase mules also for
the mountain artillery, but. he confesses that he is
not very hopeful of obtaining many in Australia.
Lieut.-Colonel Brunner came nearer the
truth than Sculey did when he observed :
“We are only in the beginning of horse-breed-
ing.” And he might have added that wc have
practically not got that far with mule-breeding.
No one who spent 24 hours in Flanders dur-
ing the World War could remain under the
delusion that the motor was more than a

qualified substitute for the animals that have
played leading parts in great wars for thou-
sands of years. For bringing field-guns into
action and ammunition to the batteries, for
nearly all front-line A.S.C. work, and for
those cavalry and mounted-infantry opera-
tions which are as important to the business
of war-winning as ever, the horse and his
humble relation the mule stand supreme. As
to peace-time activities, while the horse has
been replaced largely for city transport pur-
poses by the motor-car, it is still urgently
required by agriculturists. Where the
Country-party leader erred was in his asser-
tion that sound sires are practically all that
is needed to put the industry on its feet:—
So far as the dam is concerned, she has only one
foal per annum, and perhaps not that. So far as the
sire is concerned, he is the progenitor of probably
a number in a year. So that if you keep him
sound, in due time the mares will correspond.
This specious argument has been refuted
time and again. It is not too much to
say that the deterioration in the waler in
soundness, conformation and class generally is
due entirely to the national practice of ship-
ping mares away wholesale. We have as
many front-rank thoroughbred sires as ever;
they are rarely, if ever, sold abroad, and the
stock is continually being replenished by im-
portations from England and by natural pro-
cesses. Our mares, on the other hand, have
been pouring out of the country for genera-
tions. In the early years of the war the
ruinousness of this practice was recognised
by a proclamation forbidding it. Then the
military authorities persuaded the Govern-
ment to allow 40 per cent, of mares to each
shipment of remounts, and finally the em-
bargo was lifted altogether. The Arabs, who
understand the horse-breeding art as well as
most people, will allow any number of their
stallions to be sold abroad, but to send a
thoroughbred Arab mare out of the country is
a criminal offence. A similar policy will have
to be inaugurated here, if our horse-breeding
industry is to have the lucrative future that
was intended for it by nature, with the dif-
ference that no high-class mares, thorough-
bred or otherwise, must be sent overseas for
a term of years. In that way the waler
will quickly win back the repute he enjoyed
all over the world 30 years ago, when the
rush for the equine spoil of Australia had not
fairly begun in India, Japan, Ceylon and
Java, and when stocks had not been depleted
by a succession of wars. As to the mules
which Captain Hutton despaired of getting
here, they also depend for quality on the
class of the mares that foal them. The ex-
perience of the last war showed that they
live longer, eat less and are hardier than
horses; that for all slow work —ploughing,
packing, etc. —and for duties involving pri-
vations, they are superior to horses; and
that, where well treated, they are as quiet
as dogs. A great and profitable industry
awaits Australia in this direction, but it
will never appear till legislators make up
their minds to give it the necessary protec-
tion.

A Swelled Brown Head.
As old Jacob truly remarked, “There is scorn
in Egypt.” It was late last January that
Premier Zaghlul formed his Ministry, and
the fact that he had 176 chatterers on his
side in a Chamber of 214 filled him with
oats, he having read much and understood
very little about the omnipotence of a Par-
liamentary majority. Wherefore he demands
control of the Suez Canal, and the sur-
render of the Soudan, and a few other things,
and cities like Khartoum and Omdurman, 1000
miles distant, are plastered with procla-
mations calling on the inhabitants to rise
and take the British Empire by the slack
of its pants and heave it into the Nile.
Also there has been some shooting. The
old baksheesh type of native official is bloom-
ing again like the rose, and a thick film of
dust and decay is already visible on the layer
of. white civilisation with which Britain
painfully daubed the country during its 40
years of occupation. Decay sets in fast
when the Mohammedan, half devil and half
fez, gets control of what the Christian has
built up. Constantinople, even while it was
the Turkish capital, contained a Christian
majority which furnished any culture it
possessed. But the maudlin philanthropists
of the Peace Conference not only gave the
city back to old Unspeakable, but surren-
dered the “capitulations,” and when the
foreign colonies learned that they were to
be subject entirely to the Turkish law courts
they began to pack and flee. Now such a
desolation has set in at Byzantium that it
is expected that bears will soon build their
nests in the streets and devils walk about
unchained and probably undressed. No
doubt this success put heart into the rudi-
mentary Zaghlul, and it may be that he
thinks to “white ant” the Government in the
Soudan after the fashion of Lenin or De
Valera, forgetting that he is the wrong
color for the job. The most legitimate end-
ing will be for Britain to resume the Egypt-
ian occupation, buy the fancy king a new
gramophone to play with, and go out of the
unsatisfactory business of teaching Parlia-
mentary institutions to colored races. Then
it could devote its spare energy to teaching
geometry to cows.
N. S. Wales’s mountainous Royal Commis-
sion on poiis , ’-racing, after laboring for many
months, brought forth only a mouse, after au.
It recommended that the proprietary clubs
should become non-proprietary, but that they
should be self-governing, as before, under a
joint-committee. The past controllers were
awarded a vote of confidence, but “any person
shall have the right to appeal [from a pony
executive} to the committee of the A.J.C.
The first thought that will strike most people
who peruse this remarkable document is that
the interests of the public have not been taken
into consideration at all. There is a power-
ful case for the total abolition of pony-
racing; evidence of one sort and another
in support of abolition was put forward at
almost every sitting, and there are hundreds
of thousands throughout the State who
favor such action. An immense number of
people—many of them women and children
belonging to the classes that can least afford
to gamble—are kept poor by the ever-
present temptation to “have a flutter on
the ponies.” The organisation enabling
them to do so extends to every city street
of any importance and to all the suburbs.
And pony-racing, unlike alcohol, is capable
of being abolished out of hand. As to the
financial aspect, resumption on an equitable
basis (i.e., with compensation) would be

either ruinously expensive or only moderately
so, taking into consideration the accruing
benefits, according as the proprietors’ esti-
mate of the value of their shares or that
of a competent actuary was the basis
for discussion. It is clear, in any event,
that proprietary racing is doomed, which
means resumption in some form sooner or
later. Parliament must therefore face two
alternatives: Is it better to alienate the
professional gamblers, touts, urgers and
criminals generally who fatten on pony-
racing, and at the same time deprive the
revenue of a round sum annually; or to
allow the game to continue under somewhat
cleaner conditions, with all that perpetua-
tion means in the way of encouraging illegal
gambling on the grand scale?

Three months ago the Peacock Government
propounded a scheme whereby it hoped to
snare the votes of 10,000 soldier settlers.
The idea was an 1 Appeal Board to consider
the grievances of these settlers. The per-
sonnel of the appointed Board is all right,
and so is its scope: it has power to inquire
into the capital value of any block; decide
if such block is a living area; and, in neces-
sitous cases, fix a scale of repayments. Its
weakness lies in the fact that it must be
approached through, and its subsequent deci-
sion endorsed by, either the Chairman of
the Closer Settlement Board or the State
Rivers and Water Supply Commission,
according as the block is a “dry” or a “wet
area. Naturally, perhaps, there are whole-
sale appeals; scores of settlers with no
case at all are going to the Board on the
off-chance of obtaining a benefit, and speedy
relief is thus denied those who are suffering
from genuine grievances. An independent
officer might well be appointed who, in col-
laboration with Closer Settlement Board
officials, should examine the expediency of
each appeal, and give preference of hearing
to cases that are prima facie urgent. The
other doubtful aspect is the vesting of the
final word with the administrators whose
actions are under review; and if friction does
not occur between the Appeal Board and
those in charge of the soldier settlement
scheme, it will be a miracle. The former
can only make recommendations, and it is
highly improbable that the latter will will-
ingly subscribe to any opinions which may
be in the nature of adverse c:T ‘ of their
own administration.

which was abolish' o last s i»* ernbar-
rassments began when it suggested that Par-
liament should sanction the remission of
arrears variously estimated at £1,300,000 and
£1,600,000, a section of its supporters join-
ing with the Labor members to vote the pro-
posal down. It has now been accused, in
conjunction with the permanent head of the
Taxation Department, of having extended a
scandalous preference to pastoralists like
Kidman and Jowett, who are alleged to owe
the country vast sums, and of having in this
connection withheld the annual reports on
the department’s operations. _ The tax on
Crown leaseholds was passed in 1914 on the
principle that it would be a handy stick to
beat the pastoralist with. Neither Bruce
nor Page was in Parliament when it arrived
or when its collection —evidently not insisted
upon by the last Labor Government —was
suspended in 1918. The persons struck at
were practically all pastoralists, and a large
proportion were cattlemen. Already respon-
sible for the tax on incomes and on the pro-
fits arising from the transfer of properties,
they were ordered to pay a thumping annual
contribution on the alleged worth of their
interest in leases which, droughts and slumps
notwithstanding, were assumed to be steadily
rising in value like city allotments. Since the
befttom fell out of the beef industry the posi-
tion has become grotesque. During the last
two years £264,000 has been paid in Common-
wealth bounties on exports of frozen beef and
live cattle. At the same time the Govern-
ment has been ordered to collect huge accu-
mulated taxes and fines from the very
graziers who have been receiving bounties.
When the matter was before the House last
year the Treasurer quoted the case of a
Queensland leaseholder whose tax had been
assessed at £225 a year and who offered, be-
fore abandoning the property, to sell out for
£2OO, stock thrown in, adding that there were
many such cases.
“Macquarie Street” on a new cancer cure:
We are never likely to witness in Australia any-
thing approaching the scene which occurred in the
Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia last
month. Owing to the attitude of Dr. J. T. Glover
in withholding the essential part of his alleged cancer
cure, viz., the technique by which he was enabled to
isolate the so-called cancer bacillus—on the plea
that his researches in this direction were not yet
ready for discussion by a scientific audience —the
Toronto man was given a very rough handling by the
doet<-’“, some of whom had come from Washington
York to hear him; and finally the meeting
.. ■•- vbe wdieoes hissing the unfortunate lec-
w-..i departing without looking at the slides
whicn it was alleged showed the bacilli, and which were
awaiting their scrutiny under the microscope. One
has to go back to Pasteur's days for a similar scene,
though, to be sure, quite recently the Paris doctors
refused to hear Voronoff, the monkey-gland man, at
all, alleging that he had no respect for medical
ethics.
Dr. Glover said that he had isolated a specific
organism from every type of carcinoma which when
inoculated into healthy animals produced the disease.
Afterwards he had recovered the organism in pure
culture from these animals, and had also been able
to immunise healthy animals against the disease.
Finally, from the blood of a large percentage of
carcinoma patients he had obtained pure cultures of
the organism. He explained the preparation of his
serum from horses which gave a negative glanders
test, and several of his friends went into statistics,
alleging that they had used it in 84 cases up to May
1, 1924. Of these 25 had died, 38 were improving
and 17 were free from all symptoms of the disease,
some for as long as 1J years. So far so good; but
why on earth couldn’t he divulge his method of
isolating the bacillus, so that those who were patho-
logically inclined could follow his teaching and
cheek his results?
It is an extraordinary thing that a physician hail-
ing from the same city as the illustrious Dr. Banting,
of insulin fame, did not see his way clear to adopt
the sound scientific methods of the latter, which left
not the slightest possibility of doubt as to their
value, and which were at once received with acclama-
tion by medical men all over the world.

“Notsellor” : Ettie Rout (B. 7/8/’24)
gives utterance to a profound truth in her
analysis of the Englishman’s method of doing
things by not doing them. But she doesn’t
seem to like the system which actu-
ally is responsible for the existence of
the British Empire. She says “no-
thing is ever quite decided and everything
is always in a state of suspense, ready to be
wangled one way or another, according to
the need of the hour.” The last seven
words are the crux of the matter. By de-
ciding nothing till the situation has properly
developed the Englishman finds himself nearly
always in the position of being able to decide
correctly. During the period when the
situation is developing the English statesman
gets roundly abused for not apparently hav-
ing a policy, and when the result arrives he
gets abused again for having got the thing
done b.v “muddling through.” The system
keeps the subordinate alert, because, in the
absence of a detailed policy at headquarters,
he is responsible for the way it develops, and
he must see that it develops favorably. As
Ettie Rout concluded, “every situation as
it arises has to take care of itself,” and the
English soldier, sailor, consul or diplomatic
official is taught that he is. part of the situa-
tion and must do quite a lot of the necessary
caretaking. The German system differed
inasmuch as the German heads always tried
to forecast exactly what would happen and
laid down the rules accordingly. If the
expected didn’t happen the System went —
and has gone—smash. The French in the
eighteenth-century wars acted in much the
same way. Devolution to trusted subordi-
nates is the keynote of English policy, which
develops from the bottom up instead of from
the top down. It’s a good system, even if it
doesn’t always please the exactitudinarians
who want everything mapped out beforehand.
“P. 8.” : It isn’t only in Sydney that the wine
industry has its worst enemy in the retailers
(B. 31/7/’24j. The number of Melbourne
wineshops into which one may walk without
being ashamed of being seen, or in expecta-
tion of getting a wholesome drink, may
almost be counted on the fingers. The pubs
are not much better for the trade; one either
pays sixpence for a thimbleful in the saloon
bars or fourpence for kill-me-quick in
the other pens. I suggest the licensing
of any properly-fitted cafe or tearoom
for the sale of our light wines only,
with loss of license and heavy fines if a drop
of heavy dope be found on the premises.
Also the compulsory bonding of heavy wines
for at least three years; this, at least, would
help to knock out “pinkie.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
The British Government continues the pur-
suit of brotherhood, the drawback being that
it is a brother while the other , fellow isn’t
even a mother-in-law. It promised to pro-
mote a British guarantee of a big loan to
Russia, provided the Soviet people agreed to
think over the restoration of some of the con-
fiscated property of British subjects. and
leave off meddling in the domestic affairs of
other countries. Almost the next day the
irrepressible Bolshevik was issuing impas-
sioned appeals to the British nation to arise
and dash things about on behalf of a small
editor, who had been inciting the British
Army to mutiny. Then R. Macdonald toiled
all he knew to arrange the French evacua-
tion of the Ruhr, so that the Hun would re-
cover valuable coal and iron, and in addition
undertook to organise a big loan for Protec-
tionist Germany. The Hun in return allowed
Ludendorff to organise a great demonstration
in favor of the restoration of the empire and
a new* war. Ramsay Macdotterel is one of
the meek w’ho were to inherit the earth, and
haven’t inherited it yet, but live in hope.
More than half the trouble over the Fed-
eral land-tax is due to its unnecessary com-
plications. Not one man in a dozen, when
he is making out his return, knows what
he is legally liable to pay. The acme of
absurdity was reached when it was provided
that the bank or other big land-holding co.
should not pay on its own property, but that
the individual shareholder should pay on his
proportion; and generally he didn’t know
what that was. Consequently any taxpayer
has been liable to get a revised assessment,
or half a dozen revised assessments, years
after he thought the business Avas done with.
The Avhole system is calculated to produce
false returns, because of the technicalities
with Avliich the track is strewn and because
no Court is likely to believe that a return
was deliberately made wrong seeing that it
could so easily be wi-ong by accident. And
on top of that there is the ridiculous cost
of the thing to both tax-collector and tax-
payer.
Victoria wall probably follow the lead of
the Commonwealth in passing a Compulsory
Voting Act. Labor-member Cotter’s bill for
that purpose has been one of the slaugh-
tered innocents year after year ; but now,
with the Ministry behind him, he may be
able to get it passed. Labor members are
just as keen on compulsory voting as they
are on compulsory trade unionism ; but they
abominate compulsory military training or
service in time of war.
The Navigation Commission, which
couldn’t arrive at even a majority decision
about the important features of the Act,
found, nevertheless, some fine reasons why
we should encourage our own “secondary”
industries and get local customers for our
own “primary” products. Through freights
to Europe from New Guinea (including
Papua) were £2 13s. 6d. per ton for copra
before the war; in 1922 they were £8 6s. 6d.,
and presumably the figure is rather more
than less now.
There is now small likelihood of a split
in the Queensland Labor party. A more
probable outcome of the recent rumpus. is
the forming of a left wing, led by Collins,
with Payne as his lieutenant. The left
wingers will candidly criticise the Cabinet,
but vote with it on vital issues. But, of
course, that plan will not last long. The
men of the Left are not the kind to be
satisfied with merely barking at their own
enemies, while biting someone else’s.
One of the Mitchell Government’s legacies
to Westralia was a metropolitan water-
supply scheme which was to cost £6,000,000.
A Leg. Council select committee has been
asking questions about the financial side of
the undertaking, and the other day it put
its conundrums to the secretary of the Water
Supply Department, who was candor per-
sonified. “Interest on the scheme,” he said,
“is being capitalised, so that the present
ratepayers will not bear any of it. In other
words, the usual basis has been adopted, and
posterity will be made to pay.” There, are
many varieties of loan swindles, but this is
surely the limit—that a shiftless generation’s
bath-water should be charged up to the un-
born.
Among the charges on which Buckley, ex-
M.L.A. for Sydney, has been expelled from
the secretaryship of the N.S.W. Railway
Union was one of having “unconstitutionally”
appointed the rich Paddy Minahan, M.L.A.,
who is not a railwayman but a boot-manu-
facturer, as the union’s delegate to the 1923
A COUNSEL OF IMPERFECTION.
“A determined effort is being made by Union officials to abolish the bonus system, piecework and
payment by results.”
THE LABOR BOSSs (to the sane worker): “Whatcher mean by buzzin’ round full of henergy
and hambition, makin’ big money, while yer poor comrade ’ere is laid low with
chronic go-slow? If you were ’arf a man you’d ’op inter bed with ’im ’an show
yer sympathy by catchin ’ the same complaint!”
A.L.P. conference. In his evidence Buckley
said that Minahan had presented the union
with £4O "to make it financial with the
A.L.P.” Another witness thought the
amount was £25. Minahan himself denies
that any payment was made. Anyhow, affili-
ation fees had to be paid before the boot-
manufacturer could swing “the opinion of
my union” into Labor politics, and evidently
the union had so little opinion to swing, one
way or another, that it didn’t mind who
paid them or how its “delegate” voted at the
conference or what he said. It is an enlight-
ening example of how the “Voice of Labor”
can be manipulated.
Insanity was made a ground for divorce
in the amending bill which the N.S.W. Gov-
ernment introduced; but the Leg. Council,
which represents nobody in particular, would
have none of it. This can at least be said for
the Council’s decision—hitherto divorce has
been granted only for a matrimonial offence
of some sort; and insanity is not a matri-
monial or any other kind of offence; it is
a calamity. But so, for that matter, _is
death ; and divorce on the ground of insanity
would be justified only in a case where, for
matrimonial purposes, one of the parties was
dead —that is to say, incurably insane.
Given that condition, the public interest
would be best served by a divorce which
made remarriage possible. But there ought
to be the most complete safeguard against
divorce where the condition was not assured.
In Sydney and Melbourne at the present
time it is almost as easy to purchase mor-
phine or cocaine illicitly, provided that the
purchaser is known, as it is to buy sly-
grog; in both cities there are blackleg chem-
ists who make a specialty of supplying
addicts whom they know and can trust. The
regular price charged for cocaine by these
unscrupulous persons is 10s. for five grains,
or about £5O an ounce —the wholesale value
is something like 255. So long as the penalty
for breach of the law is only a fine, profits
of these dimensions will make_ the risk a
poor deterrent. What is needed is an amend-
ment of the law, providing gaol without the
option for anybody caught illegally trafficking
in drugs, and, where a chemist is the culprit,
deregistration.
Two useful pieces of legislation have come
into force in Victoria. One had its origin
in the feelings aroused by some particularly
notorious abortion cases; it provides for the
registration of all nurses, which registration
may be cancelled where malpractice is
proved. Of course, the unregistered practi-
tioner'will become a lawbreaker, subject to
substantial penalties, so it w T ill be much less
difficult in future to take action against in-
sanitary Gamps and reputed abortionists.
The other measure makes the licensing of
estate-agents compulsory, and the first
offender has already been caught. He had
“sold” houses which he had no authority to
sell, to purchasers who were unable to either
get delivery or regain their deposits. The
Court decided that the Estate Agents Act
applied, and cancelled the gentleman’s autho-
rity to trade.
Apart from its other vote-hunting achieve-
ments, the Prendergast Government in Vie.
has struck the idea of restoring Lemuel
Phineas Fusspot to the J.P. list, from which
even its torpid predecessors had been driven
to remove him. The charge against this
kindly old soul was that he would admit
anybody to bail, and would drive down to
the watch-house at any hour of the night
to fix it up, and if an unknown female said
slie was Mrs. Smith, and followed pastoral
pursuits at 1010 Collins-street, her bond was
accepted for large amounts. The removal
of Fusspot, who was only shifted because
he would not cease from bailing, was de-
nounced as gross cruelty to an aged and
blameless citizen ; so he is back at the old
address.
Victoria will have to tap new sources of
revenue as a result of the Prendergast Gov-
ernment’s prodigal promises, and the horse-
racing business is being reviewed. Victoria
taxes betting-tickets, bookmakers’ and racing
clubs’ licenses, and the gross takings at meet-
ings : but the receipts from all these sources
are a long way short of the £518,881 col-
lected from the racecourses_ by N.S.W. last
financial year. The tote is as far off as
ever in Victoria, although Captain Morley,
M. for Barwon, is preparing for another
offensive; but by raising the present imposts
and clapping on an admittance tax (as m
N. possibly an extra £200,000 can be
squeezed out of the racing public. That will
do to go on with, while Prendergast is search-
ing for a few loose millions.
Some of these uneasy persons who are
always finding alternative routes propose
that the Soutli-to-North railway should be a
new creation, built on the standard gauge
and branching off the East-to-West railway
just north of Lake Gairdner. Thence it
would proceed via Lake Cadibarrowirra-
canna till it joined up with the existing
track, which would also be standardised.
The idea has much to recommend it, pro-
vided it isn’t merely intended to plunge the
question into another trackless forest of
“consideration,” and leave it there indefi-
nitely. The railway, which would alter the
whole face of Australia, and, for practical
purposes, add one-sixtli to its area, isn’t
really such a costly business. Lately the
Commonwealth launched a cargo steamer,
when it has ships to burn, which cost as
much as 125 miles of standard-gauge rail-
way.
The once promising and prosperous Anzac
tweed industry for returned soldiers has
given up the ghost. The importing
gang hated it from the bottom of its
shoddy little soul, because it sold direct
to the tailors, and some of the methods used
to promote a boycott might have been called
conspiracy without straining the truth. Then
in the days of depreciated European cur-
rencies Anzac tweed was struck by the in-
flux of loads of goods which may have been
75 per cent. German, just as England was
struck by goods which were 100 per cent.
German. And while politicians were talk-
ing about putting things right a deserving-
industry died.
“Nakhoda”: I was in Italy in 1920 when
the peacemakers of the period were spending
a week-end at San Remo, a dyspeptic water-
ing-place, before rushing off somewhere else
to rearrange the mess they had made.
Through a mist of gendarmes’ bayonets I
witnessed the meeting of the Big Two, Nitti
and Lloyd George, and joined the cloud of
accredited cox*respondents at the gate of the
Villa Devachan, where the conference was
being held. A melancholy blucgum drooped
sceptically over the deliberations. Represen-
tatives of the Oppressed Minorities of Asia
Minor, of Korean nationalism and various
other people with saddle-bag complexions and
long grievances looked hungrily through the
railings while the motor-cars of the English,
French, Italian and Japanese delegations
streamed through the gateway. The news-
paper men noted the times of arrival on their
sliirtcuffs, and then tore away to wire this
important information to the four corners
of the globe, with any other exciting and
erroneous rumors they had picked up the
night before at the Casino. Out of that
conference came Lloyd George’s disagreement
with Turkey, in the course of which Britain
was nearly involved in another war. Per-
haps the Big Fourteen who have just met
in London have ushered in a new era. as was
perfervidly declared; but, remembering San
Remo, I have my doubts.
“Huflin-Guffin”: A study in contrasts.
Hamilton (Vic.) was proclaimed a borough
on September 11, 1563, and remains a
borough still. The town area is 5100 acres,
and the population is almost one to the acre.
Coburg has been borough, town and city all
within about 10 years. Hamilton is the centre of
some of the best country in Victoria, and the
hub of the finest wool-producing district of
Australia, and consequently of the world.
But that is nothing alongside Coburg’s
advantages. Coburg is less than half a dozen
miles from the Melbourne G.P.0., while
Hamilton is just on two hundred.
They are finding it out in Russia too.
Commissar Platakoff, at a recent meeting of
the Council of Labor and Defence, said that
the published accounts of the State trusts are
“pure bluff,” and declared that the only way
cut was “to abolish State monopolies and
restore full freedom in trade and industry.”
The NEP (New Economic Policy) is tending
that way, but it doesn’t tend fast enough to
prevent enormous distress: the last official
report showed there were 120.000 unemployed
in Moscow, and that is more than 10 p.c.
of the population.
THE LIMIT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s little in the daily press
I do not try to read,
Though some of it, I must confess,
Is dreary stuff indeed.
But there’s a line I never gaze
Upon without a pang,
To wit, the heading which conveys
That here’s what Lang of Fuller says,
Or Fuller says of Lang.
Have they no House in rvhieh to speak?
And Ayhat is Hansakd for
That we should have it once a week
At least, and sometimes more ?
’Twould drive a man to mix his drinks,
The halting gibes they bang,
The comments on each other’s kinks
That tell what Lang of Fuller thinks
And Fuller thinks of Lang.
Their stale tu quoques grate and jar,
Their feeble satire cuts
No ice. That neither man can spar,
’Tis obvious, for nuts.
No dexterous hit, no pungent phrase,
No ginger, bite or tang
The “stick” or two of type displays
That holds what Lang of Fuller says
Or Fuller says of Lang.
With cheap retorts that agonise,
AVith hackneyed sneex and scoff,
Interminably either tries
To score the other off.
The roller quivers as it inks,
I hear the presses clang,
And in it goes, to fill some chinks
Of space, what Lang of Fuller thinks
And Fuller thinks of Lang.

“Harold Hardupp” : The long arm of our
old friend Coincidence stretched extra-far in
a recent Melbourne divorce case. The
petitioner, an Englishman, left his wife to
start a business in Canada at the conclusion
of the war; and having established himself
he returned to England to find that the lady
had disappeared. She had mentioned to a
neighbor that she was going to S’Africa, but
all efforts to trace her failed. Her husband
then sold up the home he had made in
Canada and took a job in China; but his

health broke down and he tried Australia.
Eventually he reached Melbourne; and on
his first night there detected something
familiar in the voice of a woman who spoke
to him in the street. It was the elusive one.
The Court did the rest.
“Rua”: Bill, with my assistance, had mar-
ried a nice little girl from the city, and the
wedding festivities were being held at Tau-
ranga (M.L.). Almost as soon as the cake
was cut William evinced signs of impatience,
and when he arose to make his speech it was
easily seen he was in a hurry. “Ladies and
gentlemen,” he said, “you’ll have t’ excuse
me talking much, but the missus and me
must start home right off. I gotter drive 30
miles and milk 40 cows, an’ as she hasn t
milked before in her life it’ll take a bit o
time t’ get her inter it. So we’ll be moving
along now.” They moved almost imme-
diately. I often wondered how the missus
enjoyed her milking lesson on top of the 30-
mile drive.

“Trevdee”: Too right, Melbourne has
assault and robbery on its nerves. The other
night a young lady was walking home alone,
when heavy footsteps sounded behind her.
She increased her pace, but the steps came
closer. The girl broke into a run at last and,
seeing a gate open, tore up the pathway and
knocked frantically at the door of a strange
house. To her horror the wearer of the
heavy boots came through the gate also, and
was approaching the door when a blood-
curdling scream broke on his amazed ears.
It took him a full half-hour to explain that
he wasn’t after her —he was merely walking
into his own home!

“Femina”: My eight-year-old daughter
was in the kitchen, and a sound of alter-
cation warned me she had done something
to jar the cook’s susceptibilities. I rushed
in, and Mary violently explained the impro-
priety of which “that child” had been guilty.
It seems there is a firm selling baby’s food
which supplies a gratis sample to every
mother who fills up a form certifying that
the article is required for her progeny. One
sample being insufficient to meet my small
daughter’s desires, she had laboriously in-
dited two applications, one in my name and
the other in Mary’s, and was triumphantly
exhibiting them to the household as proof of
her astuteness. The cook, who is a confirmed
spinster, only began to recover when the
stigma on her good name had been incin-

George soon married again, and on presently
visiting the cemetery found an addendum to
the epitaph :
And George soon married another.
The furious husband advertised offering a

bourne these wild nights.
The man who happens to be
merely in the vicinity of a
lone lady after dark risks an
assault charge. A young man
of strange taste has been
shocking Elwood’s females
by springing out at them
in dark places bereft of
all his clothing, and now
if a citizen goes abroad
without liis necktie he
invites suspicion. The
other night a householder
running from a gateway to
catch a Trak-motor collided
with a dame who was pass-
ing. The woman screamed
and fled; in a few minutes
she was back with a police-
man. The lady had assured
John Hop that she was the
victim of an attack by the
nude man of Ehvood. The
constable found a biped in
a full suit of clothes and
wearing an overcoat. But
the outraged dame wasn’t
to be beaten: she insisted
that he had “just slipped
into his clothes.”
“Verri”: The gasman
called at our Manly flat the
other day. While reading
the meter he became discur-
sive. “Forgetful people in
these flats, lady,” he said.
“The pusson in the next flat
can’t remember her hus-
band’s initials ; all she could
tell me was that she calls
him Bunny.” In proof he
showed me the meter account
for next door —it was made
out to “Mr. Bunny Brown”
in the absence of any more precise informa-
tion from the chatelaine of the establishment.

“Borom”: There is one grisly relic
in the old Melbourne Gaol now being demol-
ished which has escaped the commentators.
The initials of nearly all executed murderers
and the dates of their demise are chiselled
upon the stones that form the two bottom
layers of one of the dividing walls on the
western side of the gaol. Right up to the
last execution here, that of Angus Murray,
it has been the custom to bury the sus. per
coll, alongside this wall, with no other epi-
tapli. No burial service was ever read, the
gound being unconsecrated, and the practice
of filling in the opening with quicklime
must have resulted in the total disappear-
ance of every fragment of human remains,
so that there will be nothing to indicate to
the possible excavator of the future that
it was ever a graveyard. The next hanging
to be carried out in Melbourne will take
place in Pentridge, where the scaffold is
already in position.
ARE YOU SUPERSTITIOUS?
“Yes, I gave her a diamond engagement-ring with ‘In Fidelity ’
graved on it."
“How funny! Why, that was what a friend of mine got a
divorce for!"
“Borom” : Some weeks ago a number of
white patches began to appear on the red
robe of Longstaff’s full-length portrait of
Darley, C.J., in the Sydney Supreme Court.
It may be that damp from the wall has
penetrated the canvas, but it is more likely
that certain gases have set up a chemical
interaction with some of the constituents of
the paint. City air contains a varied assort-
ment of gases, ranging from sulphur oxides
to carbon monoxide and dioxide, and some of
these work havoc with paintings. In the
London galleries more and more of the “oils”
are being glassed in. Every year or so a
violent controversy on the subject breaks
out, the old connoisseurs condemning the
new practice; but it steadily grows, all the
same, curators and trustees having had too
many painful experiences with modern paints
and modern fumes.
* * * *
“Nakhoda” : I found the following pantun
•ir the "Hikayat Malim Dewa,” a Malay
classic written about 300 years ago, and I
made this literal translation of it:—
Maid she was of old-world fashion —■
Not a maid of modern manners—•
Ere she’s bidden, gone on errand ;
Ere she’s summoned, in attendance.
Evidently Asia had its servant problem long
before Australia was thought of, and then,
as now, mistresses looked back with longing
on olden, golden days.
* * * *
“Shed Hand”: Harry’s job was to cart
the crates of poultry and eggs from the goods-
shed to the market, and the manager liked
him because of his willingness to take on
his shoulders the disposal of defunct birds
that had died in transit and had been mauled
and trampled on by their feathered fellows.
One day an inquisitive railway detective fol-
lowed Harry and watched the enterprising
carrier pull up in an obscure lane, wring a
couple of necks and carefully place the bodies
on the bottom of the crates as temporary
fowl-mats. At the markets these unwanted
birds were, as usual, given to him as a
perquisite, and re-appeared a few hours later,
in fancy trimmings, in the window of a
dressed-poultry shop. Harry works else-
where now.
* * * *
“Mills Creek” : The par. about the name
James being unfortunate in a certain family
reminds me that I once met a woman of my
acquaintance outside the St. Kilda (Vic.)
Cemetery, carrying a new baby. She was
anxious I should go in with her and sec
the headstone just erected to the memory or
two deceased children. I showed a little sur-
prise on reading they had both been named
James, and asked what the baby’s name
was. “Oh, we called him James, too,” she
said, and added %s an afterthought: ‘You
know, the Lord loved James best.”
* * * *
“Privateer”: Thirty-seven days on a trip
from Sydney to Hobart was the recent
achievement of the
flat-bottomed scow
Cathkit, which ar-
rived at the Speck’s
capital on August
9. A fortnight out
she was sighted by
the Mount Nelson
(Hobart) signal
station, but a head
wind blew her to
sea. She covered
250 miles, and ten
days later came
within sight of land
again. The crew
were getting ready
for a night ashore,
when the tub blew
out a second time,
and it took her an-
other 13 days to
get back to the Der-
went, with her com-
missariat reduced
to a few biscuits,
some tins of bully-
beef and half a
plug of tobacco.
They were half-
way up the Der-
went when a north-
erly threatened to
blow them out once
more, but a tug
arrived in the nick
of time. The Cath-
kit, built in Maori-
land in 1912, and
originally n a m e d
the Art a h-n a-
Pogue, was once TO
days out between
M aoriland and
Sydney. The
troubles of the
skipper, a veteran
of 70, began early
on the latest occa-
sion ; he and his
wife fell into the
harbor at Circular
Quay, and stayed
there for nearly ten
minutes before they
were rescued. He and the mate are sticking
to the tub, but the rest of the crew have had
enough.

“The Deacon”: Some old-time instances
of the auctioning of wives by indigent or dis-
illusioned husbands have been related in The
Bulletin lately. But Acting-Judge Ralston
(N.S.W.) recently had to wrestle with a
case where the husband had actually
(liven his wife away. The donor, who reck-
oned he was too old to support the home any
longer, had brought a boarder along to help out
the family exchequer. Then he went a step
further by formally presenting the lady,
who was born in South Africa, to the Ger-
A RECORD, IN FACT.

SPIEND MANIAC : “It teas mostly fine, old man

man boarder: he himself lit out for parts
unknown. Now the lady wants to clear
things up, and reckons a divorce on the
grounds of desertion would meet the case.
A considerably puzzled Judge, sorely afraid
of creating a bad precedent, promised to
think the matter over.

THE MAXIMS OF SIMEON THE SURE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Keep your heart closed and thin,
Empty of longing and sin,
As a field without cover,
Lest Heaven enter in
And prove you a lover.
Keep to the narrow way,
Lest at the fall of day
When the bats are winging,
With your head bowed and grey,
You be found singing.
Keep well to the right,
For the left hand is quite
Given over to laughter ;
And the swift hours in their flight
Shall move faster hereafter.
So shall you grow wise,
Blind in both your eyes
To passion and beauty
And the spring’s green surprise
That knows not duty.
Rich with the empty years,
Death shall have no fears
For the dead living
Who with clenched hearts and ears
Scorn taking and giving.

“Spare Corp”: Snowy and I, when con-
valescent after a spell in an English hospi-
tal, accepted an invitation to a swarry, at
which we were embarrassed to find ourselves
the only Diggers present. Although he be-
came the immediate centre of a large circle
eager to be thrilled, Snowy refused to be a
hero. A sympathetic reference to “the hard-
ships of the line” elicited from him nothing
more than the offhand assurance that you
could mostly beat ’em w r ith inseck-powder.
But the burbling patriots insisted on drag-
ging the conversation back to the war my
cobber only asked to be allowed to forget;
and several leading questions were fired at
him. “Did you use the bayonet often?” in-
quired one admiring spinster. “Yairs,”
drawled Snowy, “pretty often; there’s no-
thin’ like it for makin’ toast.’’

“V.C.”: In the humming days of the
Golden Mile (W.A.) some amalgam dis-
appeared from one of the mines—a not un-
common occurrence. What distinguished
this case was that the detectives were at
work so promptly and the suspected pos-
THE THING THAT REALLY MATTERED.
MRS. M.D.: “My husband’s writing is so awful that I
always wonder how anyone can understand his
prescriptions.”
HER FRIEND : “ Goodness, aren’t you afraid of some dread-
ful mistake happening?”
MRS. M.D. : “Oh no! I write all his accounts myself.”
scssors were watched so closely that they
could not get away with their booty by ordi-
nary means. However, it was managed. A
weli-known parson was stepping on the train
at Kamballie one Sunday evening, when an
acquaintance asked him to take a handbag
to Brown Hill and deliver it to a Cousin
Jack member of the congregation. Like a
lamb lie consented, and the ’tecs who were
watching on the Brown Hill station let the
clerical traveller pass without a second
glance. He thought the bag rather heavy,
but did not know till years after that it
contained £4O worth of gold.
“Percy Pinktape”: A young Melbourne
bigamist alleged something new in the way
of extenuating circumstances the other day
—he whined that his mother had forced him
to his backsliding. Then the whole story
came out. When he was only 19, a woman
a dozen years older than the defenceless
youth had taken possession of him and
married him out of hand, but agreed that, as
he was afraid to tell his mother, he should
live at home. In fear that she should come
after him if he did not go to her, the young
man met his bride with a regularity which
caused his mother to suspect that he was
falling into dissolute ways; wherefore she
“forced” him to marry the second lady. The
nature of the force employed was explained
by the mother herself. Instead of present-
ing an Amazonian appearance, she proved to
be a careworn and frail-looking old woman.
“He didn’t tell me he was married,” she
said, “or I wouldn’t have compelled him to
marry Lucy. As it was, I told him that he
wouldn’t have any breakfast in my house
until he promised to marry her.” The young
man was sentenced and released on license,
the Law declining to regard him as a very
desperate lawbreaker.
* * * -X-
-“Zanthus” discovers a skeleton :
There is the skeleton of a great story of the
adventures of a Currency boy buried away in the
Historical Records of Australia. On November 20,
1810, Governor Macquarie was notified by the British
Government that a 12-year-old lad named William
Chamberlain was being sent back to his friends in
N. S. Wales. According to the accompanying affidavit
of Dr. Daniel Quarrier, R.N., the boy had been a
prisoner on the French privateer Sans Souci when
that vessel was captured by H.M.S. Andromache and
Briton. Four years earlier, at the age of eight, lie
had been enticed on board the South Sea whaler
Frederick, which was, in 1813, captured by the
Sans Souci while on her voyage to England. Quarrier
was surgeon of the Andromache when she took the
privateer, and after treating Chamberlain for a
wound received in the scuffle he kept the lad with
him till the Andromache was paid off, and after-
wards sent him to school in Scotland. In 1816
Quarrier, being ordered to sea again as surgeon of
H.M.S. Leander, wrote to the secretary of State sug-
gesting that the lad should be sent home, and offering
to fit him out for. the voyage. When examined
Chamberlain stated that he was born at Sydney,
tne son of James Chamberlain, a bricklayer, and he
had been taken away, without the knowledge of his
parents, by a boy belonging to the Frederick. He
indicated that he had nearly as bad a time on
the English whaler as on the French privateer, and
expressed himself delighted at the prospect of getting-
home after his four years’ wandering. Presumably
he reached Sydney all right, but I have searched in
vain for further trace of him.
“Two Seas”: Some shire
councils allow the family cow
to graze in the streets of small
towns for a yearly fee of 10s.,
a practice which ensures
plenty of thrills for motorists
and sulkyists. The meditative
Strawberry is a difficult beast
to avoid, even in daylight; at
night she is a plain terror to
a man steering anything on
wheels. If she is asleep she
never awakeits until somebody
bumps into her. If she is mov-
ing, it is impossible to anti-
cipate her course. She will
never hesitate to alter it, and
cross vour bows just when you
see a chance to get past her.
If shire councils insist on
allowing cattle to infest the
highways, I suggest they
should adopt some method of
protecting the night-travelling
public. A cross-jack yard
might be lashed across Straw-
berry’s horns (no poleys should
be licensed for the “long pad-
dock”), and port and star-
board lights should be securely
fastened, with a white light
hung astern to illuminate her
number-plate. By these im-
provements the skipper of a
wheeled craft could see if
Strawberry was bearing down
upon him head on. with the
wind astern, or tacking across
the fairway with her yards
braced flat against her star-
board rigging. The red and
green lights would enable the
man on the lookout to avoid
a collision by warning the
man at the wheel.
“Tabari”: The stranding of 11.M.A.5.
Brisbane off Bootless Inlet (Papua) may
fairly have been regarded by one mariner
who knows this part of the coral-strewn
coast as a vindication of his judgment. Last
December the Inchcape steamer Prutli was
navigating those same waters —and she is
still there, a seamark of rusting iron on
top of the main reef. The skipper told the
Marine Board that his chart was incorrect
in parts, and he was emphatic that a re-
survey of this section of the Papuan coast was
an urgent matter;.but the haughty authori-
ties who attend to such things did nothing.
A SINISTER SIGN.
“Isn’t it terrible, Canon, the way religion is losing its hold on
the world?”
“Gracious me, what makes you think that, Miss Bumpus?”
“Look at the way the raffle-tickets, at the church bazaar hung fire.”
Then came the flagship—to trip over a coral
pinnacle that nearly added her to the toll
of ships that coral has claimed for its own.
Perhaps something may now be done to
bring the charts of this dangerous coral-
studded coast up to date. A whisper went
round the waterfront of Moresby after the
Brisbane salved herself that the vessel had
discovered an uncharted patch just astern of
the ledge she had been aground on. This is
quite possible: coral grows at least an inch
a year—probably even more—so with some
30 years since last survey it is possible the
shoals and patches along the coast may have
risen as many inches towards the surface.
And half a fathom is often the difference
between safety and disaster when you navi-
gate coral waters.
“Wingella” : One of the strangest instances
of the guilt of a murderer being proved by
posthumous evidence happened some years
ago in the N.T. It began with the discovery
cf the dead bodies of Thomas Spellicy and
Ah Young at Wongalara station, Wilton
River. Everything went to show that an
atrocious crime had been committed, and a
constable was sent to investigate; inciden-
tally, his mission meant a journey of 3000
miles. Spellicy, who had been wounded and
left for dead, before lie succumbed to his in-
juries managed to write an account of the
assault in his notebook, and hid the narra-
tive in his bunk. The constable, after re-
moving and burying the bodies, searched the
camp, and found the damning record. At the
trial the writing, after some argument, was
admitted as a dying declaration, and helped
materially to convict the murderer. He was
sentenced to death, but before the date fixed
for his execution he was removed to a lunatic
asylum.
“Borom”: In the
old days in Syd-
ney, when pak-a-
pu and fan-tan
games flourished
openly, it was the
custom for garrot-
ters and thugs to
lie in wait for suc-
cess f u 1 players,
w hose departure
was signalled to
them by confeder-
ates inside. Be-
cause of this some
of the gambling
e s t a b 1 i shments
acquired a bad
n ame, an d white
patrons began to
drop off. The Chi-
ne s e proprietors,
threatened with the
loss of their clien-
idle, hit on the
notion of employ-
ing escorts, sturdy
but unobtrusive
guardians, whose
duty it was to see
that nothing hap-
pened to winning
patrons on their
way home. When
a lucky player was
about to depart
with his spoils the
Chink manager
used to congratu-
late him on his
luck, and clap him
affectionately on the
back as he did so.
The palm of the
Celestial’s hand
was thickly covered
with chalk, some of
which adhered to
the winner’s coat,
conveying a notifi-
cation to the hire-
lings without that
the departing
speculator was to
be vigilantly
“shepherded” till he
should gain his train or tram. In
this manner were the garrotters foiled and
the fan-tan joints rehabilitated.

“Morris”: A flesh wound in the calf of
the leg landed him in a convalescent depot
in Blighty, and a persistent limp kept him
there through many months of bloody war.
Medical boards viewed him from time to
time, but a quiet word from the C.O. always
settled matters —the Corp. had made himsell
indispensable. Came at last a dark day
when reinforcements were most urgently
reeded, and old Colonel Hessian made a tour
of the depots. “What’s y’r name, Corporal?”
he asked when the examination was over.
“Service, sir.” “Umpli! Then you’re in for
some quick promotion. I’m markin’ you up
General Service.”
LIPS THAT PASS IN THE NIGHT.
“Doris, do you remember the first boy you
ever hissed?”
“The first? Heavens, no! I can't even re-
member the last.”
ADVICE TO POLICEMEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Murphy: If the clause providing for the
taking of arrested person’s finger-prints passed, it
would result in an infringement of the liberty of
the subject. There had been too much of that sort
of thing already. It was all very well to assert
that the police would exercise the power with discre-
tion, but his view was that there w r as a section of
the force who would abuse it.”—■ N. S. Wales Hansard.
You may spoil a person’s dinner
By proclaiming him a sinner
Who has bought and swallowed liquor after six;
Rush him rudely to the station
To the undisguised elation
Of those folks who like to get their thrills for nix.
You can lock him in a cell
That’s a close approach to Hell
(It’s often done, and no one even fidgets),
But unless you should aspire
To arouse an M.P.’s ire,
Be careful that you don’t profane his digits.
One may safely be arrested
Who a neighbor has divested
Of his property by burglary or fraud;
You may call your prey a liar,
Push him in the Black Maria,
And relieve him of his watch or other gaud,
Desecrate his wrists with chains,
Pass reflections on his brains,
Even kick him. Retribution only lingers,
And darts out and smites and flays,
Through disgusted M.L.A.’s,
Should you rashly lay a finger on his fingers.

EXIT THE DESERT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Professor David suggests that it would ‘clarify
populai - ideas’ if the so-called desert area of Central
Australia, which differs essentially from the Arabian
and Libyan type, should be re-christened by some
such name as ‘wilderness.’ ”
What’s in a name ? Though Shakspeare might
not wot,
Remember AVilliam was a poet, not
An erudite professor. Had he been
He might have found a devil of a lot.
Ring out the desert! Yes, I know full well
A Gloire de Dijon would as fragrant smell
However designate. Yet who contends
That mutton labelled goat would not repel ?
Ring in the wilderness —wherein suffice
A bit o’ skirt, a slab o’ rhyme, a slice
O’ cake, a “urap o’ screech” (as Omar knew)
To make a replica of Paradise!

Profits have been bettered on only four occa-
sions, and they were in the war period, when
abnormal underwriting conditions- —artifici-
ally high prices and exceptional risks —
caused managements to wonder whether the
larger surpluses then shown would remain
in their coffers when the inevitable reaction
set in. Though very heavy losses were sub-
sequently experienced, powerful and prudent
offices like the N.Z., which had spread their
risks, suffered amazingly little from the
swing-back. Latest profits are in a different
category, because underwriting conditions
have become normal, or thereabouts, and, the
outlook having brightened, the management
can pretty confidently expect that every penny
now harvested is profit definitely earned.
The demands on the claims department so
subsided during the 12 months that only three
times in 20 years was the loss rate lower. On
the other hand, costs were heavier: last year
office exes, were up £20,898 on a net pre-
mium’income £28,526 smaller, though, taxes
having declined £18,947, the addition to the
all-in cost was only £6951. Details of under-
writing figures for many years are given

*General. ISan Francisco disaster.
The surplus for the past 12 months (£6B,SSS)
was 6.7 p.c. of the net premium income, and
gave but slightly more than 7.6 p.c. on the
£900,000 of paid capital. However, in its 60
years the N.Z. Insurance has developed a big
investment business with its accumulated
funds ; and £104,452 of interest and rents was
collected in the 12 months. This meant a
further 11.6 p.c. on capital. _ In addition,
since the 1923 accounts were issued, an in-
vestment fluctuation and contingency account
has had £12,947 net dropped in, and the
whole of that is probably also true profit
earned. Probably it represents portion of
the surpluses won by selling securities at
prices in excess of written-down book values.
Altogether the accounts show 20.7 p.c. on
capital available to pay 124 p.c. divs. The
co. is so very snug that the investment earn-
ings supplied all except Is. sd. in the £ of
divs.; after reserving £12,947 of earnings for
contingencies, shareholders took only £BO4B of
the £68,858 surplus from underwriting.
At the 1923 balance paid capital was
three-quarters of a million, but £150.000
more bonus scrip has since been issued
by tapping the investment fluctuation
reserve for £70.000 and the general re-
serves for £50,000, and by taking
£30,000 from a reserve for taxes no longer
required. In a dozen years proprietors have
had their holdings trebled by bonus issues, so
old hands, though they were called upon to
nay a small premium on an issue 18 years
back, are nowadays receiving more than 35
p.c. p.a. on their investment. Moreover, their
present holdings are represented by assets of
an excellent type which run practically no
insurance risks, provided underwriting is con-
ducted in the future on the sound lines which
have developed the office’s great strength.
After paying the latest div. there were
£1.081.069 of reserves: Reserve fond,
£400,000; unexpired risks reserve. £513.000;
investment and contingency fund, £14,608;
Profit and Loss carry forward, £153,461.
The £513,000 set aside for unexpired risks was
more than £lOO,OOO larger than the amount
which would have been required to re-msure
the business on the books at May 31. lhere-
fore, all going well, shareholders i-''IO,OUU
investment has the backing of £670,000 ot
reserves not liable to be raided by under-
writing except in the remote contingency ot
a great disaster. The latest balance-sheet
totted up 21 millions of assets, with, on the
other side, £220,162 of sundry creditors, and
unearned premiums (which may include hid-
den reserves) and £214,757 appropriations
for unascertained losses, which are also no
doubt on a liberal scale. Holdings of public
securities in five continents had a book value
of £1,648,135, and £208,394 was available
in cash form. Premises had a book value
of £382,599 ; mortgages, £18,717 ; and branch
and agency balances totted up £243,711.
Incidentally, funds were equal to 193 p.c. of
last year’s net premiums, that proportion
giving great strength to the office apart from
£600,000 of uncalled capital, because funds
14 times premium income are recognised as
ample protection for insurers. In recent
years the N.Z. Insurance has been develop-
ing a trustee business, but earnings have
not been disclosed. During the past 12
months new estates put into the co.’s care
and a new entry, “Debentures and mort-
gages held as trustees for debenture-holders,
£1,983,200,” took the total book value of
trust accounts to £3,440,574 from £1,238,590.

The Victoria is one of the few Australian
banks which have not had to seek additional
capital to keep funds in step with a grow-
ing business. For many years after the
debacle of the ’nineties, its own funds were
large in relation to the amount left in its
care by the public. Just prior to the war it
held only £4 of outside money for every
£1 belonging to shareholders, so it could
have nearly doubled its business and
kept within the safety zone. Now, notwith-
standing the natural expansion over the 10
years and the price-inflation of the period,
only £5 6s. of the public’s money is held
for every £1 of funds. Even that change has
made several millions more available for
trading at high interest rates, and the ab-
normal conditions which have generally
favored all dealers in money have had a big
effect on gross earnings. The next com-
parisons show how net profits in the intro-
ductory table were made up for a number of
years:—

*Less provision for doubtful debts.
Expenses are now taking 52.1 p.c. of gross
profits, compared with 49.2 p.c. nine years
ago; but earnings are so much larger that
£78,000-odd more is divisible on the same
capital after setting aside £3OOO in a staff
fund. Perhaps a lot of apparent profit has
also been set aside on the quiet, but that is
a matter on which only the insider can have
information. So far as the published accounts
tell, the Bank of Victoria seems to have
brought into the light a relatively larger pro-
portion of the earnings of the abnormal
period than most banks; note, for instance,
the leap of gross earnings for 1921. Inci-
dentally, nothing has been visibly struck off
book values of premises for the past three
years. Something may of course have been
spent on premises out of undisclosed profits;
on the other hand, considerable additions
have certainly been charged up to capital.
Net profits have so improved that the div.
rate is now 50 p.c. larger than it was only
six years back, and a proportionately larger
amount is going into reserves. The draw-
back of the Bank of Victoria for ordinary
shareholders is that they have command of
no cheap money to assist their divs. Capital
has not moved for 24 years: it is made up
of £416,760 of prefs. and £1,061,250 of ordi-
naries. The former are the old-time funded
deposits and are entitled to 5 p.c. p.a. non-
cumulative, but they also have the right to
follow ordinaries point for point. They also
have first call in a wind-up until such time
as the ordinaries arc fully called—the ords.
are of £lO each paid to £5. Another pro-
vision in the old agreement giving prefs.
prior rights in a return of capital
until 10 half-yearly divs. of at least
7 p.c. p.a. had been paid has been com-
plied with. The only funds assisting capital
are the reserves of £785,157; they now ex-
ceed half the amount called up on all scrip
and are, therefore, very helpful. Earnings of
a trifle more than 6 p.c. by shareholders’
funds exceed 0 p.c. on capital.
During the past 12 months there was a
small falling-off in the deposits held, but
over a half-million more was put out on
loan. Here are details which also show
the movements of balance-sheet groups over
10 years:—

The new advances have not weakened the
liquid position to below recognised safety
limits: at June 30 42. S p.c. of all liabilities
was within easy reach or had Government
backing. To protect £6,864,070 of the pub-
lic’s money not held liquid there__ were
advances with a book value of £8,771,211
and £423,139 of bank premises: and de-
positors are also entitled to note the
£1,061,250 of uncalled capital. One feature
of the Bank of Victoria which partly ex-
plains the relative mildness of its divs. is
that after the ’nineties smash capital was
less drastically dealt with than in most
other banks that crashed. Moreover, it was
paying divs. when other managements were
worrying whether they could ever extricate
their concerns from the clutches of creditors.

For 16 years this X. S. Wales wool-broking
and stock-and-station agency concern lias
had a great run. Profits have always been
much larger than the 10 or 12J p.c. divs.
have required, and the business has been
greatly expanded by surplus profits. Since
1908 £201,000-odd has been thus visibly
laid aside to develop the business. At the
commencement of that period paid capital
was onlv £55,000. and reserves were less
than £12,000. Accumulated profits have
not, however, been held in reserve accounts:
£145,000 has been taken in small parcels to
feed bonus-scrip to shareholders. The 10 p.c.
divs are, therefore, very much better than
they look: at present that rate is returning
32.7 p.c. on the holding of 16 years back.
The new shares are not issued as bonus scrip
by the directors; periodically they vote por-
tion of profits as a “special cash-bonus, and
simultaneously they offer a similar amount of
new shares at par. And as the market offers
for scrip are usually about double its
face value, shareholders naturally rush the
shares instead of the cash. One point
which the outsider who is attracted by Pitt
Son and Badgery’s glittering record should
not overlook is that the issue of bonus scrip
cannot continue indefinitely; for every
issue increases the amount demanded by the
dividend. And there must be a limit to the
energetic co.’s turnover possibilities, and,
therefore, to its profits; also, no doubt, a
limit to capital employable. Moreover,
though profits lately have been of record
dimensions, it is well to note that the average
over 10 years has been'under £29,000 ; and
the co. is in a business in which the average
over a long period is the only safe guide.
The £20,000 appropriated from latest pro-
fits takes paid capital to £200,000. and after
payment of the final div. it will be sup-
ported by £77,853 of visible reserves. So,
notwithstanding all the bonus scrip issued,
the co.’s position is very comfortable: funds
have to earn only a little more than 7 p.c.
to show 10 p.c. on paid capital. The co.
is well placed in another respect: the greater
portion of what little financing of clients is
done is provided by its own funds. Though
there were £185,156 of outside liabilities on
the books at June 30, on the other side were
£lOO,OOO of fixed deposits, and £41,250 of
War Loan and accrued interest. So the co.
was really working on only £43.906 outside
money, and that was covered by book
accounts for £181.240 and freeholds valued
at £149.520. The next table shows balance-
sheet movements over 10 ’’"°rs :

Since 1914, without calling on shareholders
for a penny, and by increasing outside lia-
bilities by not quite £150,000, Pitt, Bon and
Badgery lias added nearly £290,000 to book
values of assets.

The directors have not bothered to account
for the falling away of profits in the past L-
months; and as sufficient was earned to give
ordinaries 20 p.c. for the year and then
visibly lay-by more than 54 p.c. on paid capi-
tal, shareholders are probably not perturbed.
The next comparisons show the course ot
trading which, though erratic, has in each

The reduction of management expenses, rate™,
taxes, depreciation, etc., to less than those of
any other year is a feature of the latest
accounts. Evidently the condition ot the
ham aiid bacon markets towards the close
of the financial year had a very great effect
on earnings: the book value of stocks was
half as large again as at the previous
balance, and it is unlikely that the enlarge-
ment of the works wholly accounted for then-
growth. During the 12 months the book
value of premises and plant was increased
from £28.980 to £52,763, and the co. had
been so snugly financed by surplus profits
that the additions were practically covered
bv the co.’s deposits and cash on hand. At
June 30 it was working on an overdraft ot
£6276, and owed £3472 on sundry accounts,
but cash holdings were equal to all but £BO
of this. .....

George Farmers had beeii established 57
years when the public was invited to become
interested in 1919. The business was bought
for £87,000 cash and 33,000 fully-paul £1
ordinaries, £27,500 of the purchase price
being for goodwill. The public subscribed
(10,000 8 p.c. cum. prefs. and 27,000 ordi-
naries, and on the latter in five years no less
than 80 p.e. has been paid in divs. Mean-
while surplus profits have added tangible
assets to cover all but £3960 of the £33,.)0S
represented by goodwill and preliminary exes,
only five years back. In the four years since
the first accounts were issued £18,420 has
been added to the book value of factories
and equipment, £7829 to liquid assets (in-
cluding stocks and book debts), and outside
liabilities have been reduced by £2396. No
new capital has been introduced. This irn
provement, taken into account with the hand-
some divs. paid, has been a great achieve-
ment. The directors report that the addi-
tions to the factory have been “practically
completed,” and that “the effect should be
evident in the future” ; and as capital hasn’t
been increased this ought to mean even larger
results. Ordinaries are still at a high pre-
mium in the market; in July they found
buyers at 525., but after the issue of the
accounts they fell to as low as 495. 6d. (cum
Is. 6d. div.). The subscriber at 20s. per
share five years ago has averaged 16 p.c.
p.a. on his investment.

he retired from the g.-m.’s chair of the' Life

reimburse him for outlay on preliminaries.
No free shares were issued to anybody. The
response to the appeals for capital was n,ot
encouraging, the New Era having been intro-

boom. At first 100,000 10s. prefs. (S p.c.»

ordinaries were offered, but in November
last it was decided to limit the pref. issue to
50,000 and make ordinaries available “on
easier terms.” The reduced pref. issue was
fully subscribed, but the accounts at May 31
show that only £5O of ordinaries was taken
up. Including calls in advance, at the bal-
ancing date £21,416 had been paid up ; only
£4342 remained callable. Some of that is

in doubt; already a forfeited-shares account
has made an appearance.
Capital was very small for a co. seeking
business far afield ; nevertheless, the directors
opened branches in Sydney and Adelaide and
appointed local Boards. And the results.
For the year ended May 896 policies assur-
ing £408,015 were written, and total pre-
mium income amounted to £14,494. Agents
commission and salaries and. travelling exes,
alone absorbed £17,110, while management
exes, took £7754 and preliminaries and sun-
dries £2533. Claims ran to £516. So, not-
withstanding that brokerage on shares was
only 5 p.c., after taking credit for a trifle ot
interest earnings and re-insurance. commis-
sion (all general risks have been re-insured),
the accounts closed with a deficit of £13,148,
apart from the small actuarial liability under
policies. That means that only £8268 of
paid capital remained intact. But not all
of that is available for developing the busi-
ness, because there is a limit to which the
£5OOO lodged with both the Vic. and S. Aus.
Governments can be mortgaged. Already
against remaining assets the New Era had
run up an overdraft of £299, raised £llOO
of deposits from shareholders and others, and
owed £3992 in sundry accounts. The direc-
tors talk confidently of the current year pro-
ducing at least £lO,OOO of renewal premiums,
but on the experiences of other new offices
the New Era will be fortunate if it collects
anything like that, particularly in face of the
balance-sheet, which alone is sufficient to
cause shareholders a lot of anxiety.

The proposed Westralian Mining Commis-
sion has not yet been appointed, but it is
believed that the members will include an
engineer from abroad, a local mine-manager,
a representative of the workers, and a Gov-
ernment official. Politicians are to be barred.
One of the most important problems that
the Commission will be asked to report on
is how costs at Kalgoorlie can be reduced so
as to bring immense bodies of low-grade ore
now considered unprofitable into the list of
payable reserves.
* * * *
To date Westralian State batteries —there
are about 30 of them—have milled nearly
14 million tons gold ores and 80,000 tons tin
ores for a return of nearly six millions.
Capital expenditure on these plants has
amounted to £400.000, and is steadily in-
creasing. Losses have run into thousands
each year, but without these batteries many
a prospector would be unable to carry on,
and many a claim still producing would be
on the abandoned list.
* * * *
The cleaning up of the Ivanhoe plant
(W.A.), which has been taken over by the
Lake View and Star, has already given
gold worth about £35,000. This is not
an isolated instance of wealth which has
slipped into odd corners of a treatment
plant. Not so long ago a purchase at a
liquidator’s sale resulted in the finding of
almost a similar amount of the precious
metal which had lodged in the back of a
furnace flue. There is also the case of a
wealthy Perth property owner who founded
his fortune on the lucky purchase of some
Berdan pans and plates, which no one would
bid for at a mine sale near Kalgoorlie.
* * * *
At June 30 Freney Oil Co. (W.A.) had a
little over £ll,OOO in hand. Stores, boring
plant, equipment, etc., had a book value of
about £10,400. The directors are at present
anxiously awaiting Dr. Wade’s verdict on
the Kimberley areas. Their report says
nothing about the negotiations for amalga-
mation with Okes Dutack Co., which are pro-
ceeding in Adelaide.
* * * *
Though “gold-bearing floaters,” “good dish
prospects” and “bold quartz outcrops” are
still reported from Jones’s find (W.A.), in-
terest in that new field is waning. One hard-
headed expert, after an inspection, stated
that he “didn’t meet with sufficient encour-
agement to justify taking any options,” and
another optioneer summed up: “Have seen
nothing worth much.” Several pegging dis-
putes await settlement, including one over
Jones’s reward claim.
* * * *
Gt. Boulder (W.A.), following the lead
given by Associated, is considering the ques-
tion of acquiring a mine in Canada. The
co. now operates three shows in the West —
the old Gt. Boulder, at Boulder; the Hau-
nan’s North-Golden Zone, at the north end
of Kalgoorlie; the 0.K., at Norseman.
Though there are no brilliant prospects ahead
of any one of them, recent reductions of
costs should permit the extractiijp of a good
deal more ore than the directors expected in
recent years.
* # * #
Returns under the Westralian Mines De-
velopment Act last year include some in-
teresting items. One is a small amount spent
in “proving” the kerosene-vaseline-soap oil-
find near Southern Cross. About £2OOO was
spent on track-clearing and well-sinking be-
tween Laverton and the boomed and busted
Mt. Shenton goMfield. The State prospect-
ing parties which roamed about the back-
blocks for some months and found nothing
also took more than a thousand. Advances
of over a couple of thousand apiece to Ives
Reward and Daisy Queen are also in the
list, and both lots can be classified as doubt-
ful accounts.
* * * *
Westralia’s latest specimen shows are the
Monte Carlo, at Cue, and the Yorkshire Rose,
Ivalgoorlie. From the former the owners
have taken out 300 oz. gold down to 40ft.,
while from a rich patch at 20ft. in the latter
a party has within the past two months won
nearly £6OOO. The Yorkshire Rose workings
are near the old Hannan’s Reward North,
close to Hannan’s-street.
* * * *
“O.B.”: Brilliant Co. may be feeling very
confident about the wealth to be won from
the next level of the Gnow’s Nest, but there
are more reasons than those given by the
“Wild Cat” (B. 21/8/’24) why the future
is quite a gamble. Water makes in the
mine at the rate of 250,000 gallons daily, and
it costs £lO a day to keep the pumps going.
If they stopped for half a day it would be
good-bye to pumps, mine and what has
already been paid as purchase money. The
show is worked out to 300 ft., and the cost
of putting the plant in proper order and
opening up the 400 ft. level is roughly esti-
mated at £lO,OOO. Though the co. took over
two months ago, it has not yet made a
start with main-shaft sinking.
* * * *
Lander Oil (Q.) some time ago decided to
learn more about its prospects from the evi-
dence disclosed by the drill at Orallo, and
R. E. Allen, a Californian petroleum geologist
and engineer, has been engaged to go
thoroughly into the matter. He is already
on his way north, and will remain with the
Lander co. for 12 months. A new drilling
team from California is tackling the cement-
ing problem at the bore, the Fife brothers
having returned to their own country when
their contract ran out.

Geologist Morton’s report on the Widgec
silver-lead deposits near Gym pie (Q.) sup-
ports the “Wild Cat’s” statement of a few
weeks back that nothing startling has so far
been found. Local talk had made the field
appear like a pup from Mt. Isa. About a
dozen prospectors are on the ground, and an
attempt is being made to float a co. The
field does not warrant one yet; much more
work is necessary to prove whether the de-
posits are of any commercial value. Morton
says that on present evidence Widgee does
not encourage an optimistic view.
* * * *
Towers Tin Co. did not pick a winner in
the Shrimp mine, Kangaroo Hills (N.Q.). A
couple of years back it was vaunted as the
future big low-grade producer of the field.
The formation was large (50ft. wide), but
open-cut work proved too many blanks, and,
despite occasional rich pockets, crushings
averaged only around 2 p.c. A lot of work
has been done on surface blows, but the ore
lenses have practically all proved small. An-
other trouble has been the increasing mundic
content, making dressing more difficult. The
future of the show seems to depend on rich
shoots in proximity to the crush zone, which
carries low tin values. Developments in the
Sardine mine encourage these hopes.
* * * *
The Big Brill lode, Kangaroo Hills (N.Q.),
has possibilities which would be enhanced if
copper commanded a decent price. The lode
has the rather unusual association of rich
copper carbonates and tinstone. It is up to 6ft.
wide, and has recently been tunnelled below
the surface workings, where it looks to be
going down strongly, and is carrying both
metals. Another high-grade tin shoot has
been located further east. Twelve feet of
driving on this shoot at 50ft. down produced
the handsome return of 5$ tons concentrates
worth about £SOO, thus providing more cash
to test the big lode.
* * * *
Crushings for Herberton tin field (N.Q.),
during July were satisfactory. Including 6
tons stream tin, production was worth £7324.
The Arbouin gave 24 tons concentrates out of
a total of 52 tons. Its ore panned out £5
per ton, quite satisfactory for a low-grade
show. Vulcan tributors did better with 276
tens for 13 tons concentrates worth £1504.
Great Northern is not yet giving expected re-
sults ; stoping is practically in abeyance
while the old workings are being restored,
and the next couple of months should see the
mine producing well. There have been good
developments in the No. 3 north level of the
Old Bradlaugh. where a 7ft. width will bulk
about 15 p.c. Work will be speeded up there;
a new shaft has already been started and 10
head of stampers purchased. Concentrates
(70 p.c.) are bringing £162 on the field.
* * # *
Owing to an abnormally wet season,Walter
Baker has not made much progress with
his prospecting of the Russell and Johnstone
Rivers (Q.) gold-tin areas. A few shafts on
the flats located colors at 14ft. and 24ft., but
soakage beat the pumps befoi’e bottom was
reached. So far flood waters have held up
work on the original claim on which Baker,
Walter Colley and C. H. Wray had reported
favorably. One shaft on an island on the
Russell is said to have shown 29|gr. gold and
41b. tin per yd., and another 3gr. gold, a little
tin, and a trace of another metal not yet
identified. From now on good progress should
be made in proving the areas.
Mt. Cobalt has become the busiest mine in
the Cloncurry district (Q.) ; it now has 95
men on the pay-sheet. Production is being
regulated to about 150 tons of ore monthly
averaging 5 to 6 p.c. cobalt. The lode in the
south end of the 112 ft. level is full of pro-
mise, and the only serious trouble on the
horizon at present is water supply. Unless
rain falls during September operations will
certainly be curtailed. The output for July
was valued at £5708.
* * # *
Ajax, Daylesford (Vic.), having been liv-
ing from hand to mouth after a fair run of
divs., became disturbed when the Federal
tax-master claimed £679 as his first call for
retrospective taxes. The co. having squeezed
10 thou, from a six months’ run on easily-
won stone ought to have been able to meet
a little bill like that without having to show
a debit balance. Most of the good stone of
the mine was blocked out during the last 18
months’ spin, so, with No. 6 not coming up
to the mai’k, the new season’s goods are
mostly in crepe. Rises to No. 5 carry 3ft.
of stone, which local talk says is payable.
But that may mean that it will only about
cover outgoings. East at No. 5 a crosscut
in 250 ft. has apparently drawn a blank. A
spell of call-making at Ajax might easily hap-
pen if better stone fails to show between Nos.
5 and 6 levels.
* * * •
Geologist Baragwanath, having kicked over
Alex. Peacock’s Bunga oilcan, was politely
asked to put it straight again. Baragwanath
says that good manners have to give way to
science. That brought the bore foreman up
from Lakes Entrance with a testimonial that
every care was taken to prevent drill grease
or oil of any sort getting into the hole.
Soothing-syrup having been administered by
some unnamed oil experts, a co. has been
registered, and it is now being floated on the
troubled sea of speculation. From every
aspect boring in Gippsland is a gamble, and
it must be left to the drill to make or mar
the show.
* # • *
Just when Bunga claimed the limelight
C. C. Jackson’s Leongatha oil crowd were
lowering the flag half-mast. Funds have got
low, and although expert Lyne certifies as to
prospects that does not help when the till
is empty. For a time £2O shares were
offered at half-price, but when that failed
shareholders who had already put up good
stuff would not furnish more funds to bring
it back. London was at last cabled to, and
although it has politely asked to be let look
at figures, the wise men squatting over the
drill-hole don’t think the inquiry is suffici-
ently hearty in tone to allow John Bull to
be regarded as a rescuer.
# * # *
Capital called up by Mt. Hunter Tin to
work alluvial ground at Welshpool was
£7500, and nearly half of it is resting in
the bank. This is because the pumping
plant is not up to time, but with that trouble
over and pipe lines cut, tin winning should
not be far off. Then the job will be to prove
that there is enough of the metal, because
hitherto the Vic. south coast-line has not
proved good enough.
* * • •
Mining was worth over £200,000 more to
the Speck last year than in the previous 12
months, thanks to the better prices for
metals. Tin showed the biggest increase
(£124,548). Mt. Lyell weighed in with
£435,413 of copper, which is £43,878 more
than in 1922. Coal increased £9781 to
£70,797. The output of carbide collapsed
£70,789 to £64,720, owing to the State-aided
Electrona works going into liquidation.
Negotiations are in progress to resuscitate
the show in a manner that will release the
Government from liability, and it is ex-
pected that the works will be producing
again shortly. Osmiridium output was almost
67340 z., worth £19,642, a drop of £15.870 on
the previous year. Production of silver at
£91,339 was down £37,098.

George Laurie, one of the prospector
Lauries who discovered Tanami (N.T.),
claims to have found a new goldfield south of
the Alligator River and 70 miles from Pine
Creek. Massive ironstone and quartz crops
show out, and one lode sft. wide and trace-
able for 30ft. has given assays'of 7|dwt. to
lOdwt. A mile east are two other big out-
crops, and -a shaft down sft. on a lode 4ft.
wide shows 2ft. assaying almost 2oz. and
another 2ft. gives 740 z. Bulk samples from
3 tons ore are said to have given 7oz. and
lOoz. values. Arthur Clarke, of Cairns, is
forming a syndicate of 300 £lO shares to
investigate the find.
* # * *
Malcolm Newman, in his report to Allu-
vial Tin shareholders —that is the prospect-
ing co. which sponsored Malim Nawar —•
pooh-poohs the suggestion that Malayan tin
possibilities have been almost exhausted.
He considers that “there are many good pro-
positions to be found without going far
afield,” and believes also that an exploratory
campaign in new country “would stand a
good chance of finding payable areas suitable
for dredging.” Moreover, recent engineering
developments, giving promise of larger turn-
overs at lower costs, open up new possibili-
ties in even half-pound ground if the tin
market is favorable. Newman is, however,
disappointed with Southern Burma. The
nature of the deposits there, lie says, indi-
cate a rising coast-line unsuitable for the
accumulation of deep alluvial. Abnormally
heavy rainfall is another drawback to econo-
mical working, and altogether he “does not
anticipate that Southern Burma will ever be
a large producer of alluvial tin,” though two
good deposits have been discovered.

One of Australia’s big men, Dr. Grafton
Elliot Smith, Professor of Anatomy in Lon-
don University, arrived by the Niagara. He
comes to have a look at his father, who has
passed 85. The Professor had been
snapped up by the California Uni., for a
course of lectures, so he came on across the
Pacific to his native land. The science men
are after him and have already booked him
for the Adelaide Congress, the Journalists
have pinned him down for lunch on
Sept. 3, and later on he will do a little
lecturing in Sydney. The Smith family—
the N.S.W. Director of Education is one of
the clan —have not seen big brother for 10

Although the fund was inaugurated 10 years
ago, the statue of the late Chief Justice Way
has only just arrived in Adelaide. It is the
work of Alfred Drury, R.A. The local con-
tractors have commenced to fix the pedestal
in the North-terrace gardens, opposite the
Adelaide University. The statue is of bronze,
showing the Chief Justice in a standing
position, and the pedestal is to be of Austra-
lian granite. It is hoped that Langdon Bony-
thon will return from England in time to un-
veil the memorial to his old friend.
Lord Tennyson, one-time Governor of
South Australia, and later Governor-General
of Australia for a year, was 72 on August
11. He is now Deputy-Governor of the
Isle of Wight, living at Farringford, which
his poetic dad is said to have bought out
of the profits of “Maud.” Captain Lionel
Tennyson, who captained an English XI
against Armstrong’s team in England, is
his only surviving son. Two others were
killed in the war—Harold, when the Viking
was torpedoed, and Audrey, on the French
Front.
Tasmanians who hold that women are un-
fitted for public life are chuckling over the
fact that Mrs. Edith Waterworth’s nomina-
tion for [lie recent by-election in Hobart was
hopelessly informal. The lady’s nomination
was mailed from the Tas. Agent-General’s
office in London, but failed to carry the attes-
tation required by the Electoral Act; and the
Chief Justice ruled it out. Not that it mat-
tered much, for the recount for the Snowden
vacancy gave Major Payne the seat, and indi-
cated that Mrs. Waterworth, contrary to ex-
pectation, would not have been elected.

James Ramsay Petrie, who died at Law-
son (N.S.W.) the other day, was director
and adviser of the co. formed in London in
1910, and called the Commonwealth Oil
Corporation, to work oil-shale deposits in
the Wolgan Valley (N.S.W.). A Scot out
of Fifeshire, he had had experience of that
kind of work in the Cold Country; but, al-
though the shale was there and nearly
two millions were sunk—mostly in extrava-
gances—the show never wagged its tail seri-
ously, and finally going out of business took
along witli it the town of Hartley Vale,
where crude oil had previously been refined.
John Fell, the Sydney business man, made
an effort to resuscitate the industry, but
failed, and now acres of machinery are
rusting around Newnes township.
A. J. Monger, who. has been president of
the Westralian Cockies’ organisation since
it was started in a humble way 13 years
ago, resigned the other day, in consequence of
the party split. In the course of the 13
years he has helped the movement liberally
with money as well as counsel (its co-opera-
tive trading venture is as big a thing in its
way as the political branch), and had nature
endowed him with Parliamentary ambitions
he could have had his choice of half a dozen
seats. A tall, reserved, unsmiling man, he is
idolised and hated in about equal proportions,
and there is a suspicion that he rather likes
being hated. When he is not present his
agriculturists refer to him as Alec, but none
of them has ever been known to call him
Alec to his face. It would be much too risky.
Tasmania lost a good citizen the other
day w T hen W. M. Williams passed over—
another victim to cancer. A retired draper,
he made a couple of trips to Europe at his
own expense, brought back to his fellow-
aldermen of Hobart much information con-
cerning the management of public gardens
and reserves, and induced them to turn
several of the city’s bare spots into things
of beauty. Pie gave much time to Hobart’s
general hospital, of which he was president,
and he stood up to the B.M.A. when that
highly-organised trade union went on strike
a few years ago. Williams was one of the
prime movers in inducing' the City Council
to take over the Beaumaris Zoo and make
it a collection of which Hobartonians are
proud. In view of these and other good
points the fact that he was a Tory-wowser
member of the Leg. Council for six years
will not be remembered against him.
“Lily-Beale”: A good citizen of Torra-
weena. near Gilgandra (N.S.W.), has just
increased her quiverful with twins, making
a total of 27 children living. Her eldest
daughter, a woman of 32, is already the
mother of nine children, including one lot of
triplets and two pairs of twins.
John Hamilton, of Hobart, who passed
out at 90 the other day, founded a firm which
has borne his name for over half a century.
He represented Glenorchy in the Leg. Assem-
bly from 1887 till 1903, and had been chair-
man of the Hobart Gas Co., president of
the Chamber of Commerce, and a director
of the Cascade Brewery and the old Tas.
Steamship Co. (since absorbed by the
U. S. S. Co.). Even then he had time to do
some goat-riding, and had been the Masons’
Grand Sec. and Deputy Past-Master.
Australian scientific circles are mourning
the death in Sydney of Thomas Godwin,
whose experiments in* the hybridising, of
plants were widely known among botanists.
Orchids were his favorites, and he succeeded
in producing a number of new blooms by
cross-breeding and artificial fertilisation. He
was Australian born and 65 at the end.
Among the 17 Yic. Leg. Councillors who
will have to go up for re-election next May
are three Labor Ministers, McNamara,
Beckett and Disney; Arthur Robinson and
Cohen, two ex-Attorneys-General; Frank
Clarke, the president, and his brother,
W.L.R.; Edgar, Chairman of Committees ;
and Goudie, the best of the Cocky bunch.
In the past walkovers or polls of from 22 to
36 per cent, have been the rule. But Labor
will no lohger let things go by default like
that. The fact that a Labor Govern-
ment has arrived in Britain helps to make
the party feel that every political perch is
worth fighting for.
The death of Mary Sidwell, a Goulburn
(N.S.W.) pioneer, recalls a quaint old in-
dustry. Her father, George Davis, woke up
betimes to the fact that there was easy and
safe money in the toll-bars that graced the
thoroughfares of early N. S. Wales, and
promptly leased a number on the Great
South-road. He placed daughter Mary in
charge of the toll-bar at Run o’ Water,
between Goulburn and Yass, in the heyday
of bushranging—but she lived to be 80 and
the last toll-bar keeper in N.S.W.
Tom O’Donnell, the Tas. R.C. padre who
lifted a lone voice at the war-time rallies in
favor of Conscription, and who was afterwards
court-martial] ed in England for alleged dis-
loyalty, has been in the wars again. This
time the argument was with an enraged bul-
lock which broke into the school grounds in
his parish of Latrobe. Several of the kiddies
had hairbreadth escapes and the cow’s
brother was eventually put out, but not
before the plucky padre had his clothes
ripped to ribbons and himself knocked about
generally.
Gone over the range at 96, David Watson,
the Grand Old Man of Adelong (N.S.W.),
where he had lived for 60 years. He was
a friend of Dr. Livingstone, the explorer, in
his young days.
The late Speaker Mackey, of Vic., left no
real estate, but personalty valued at £2037
an insurance policy of £lOOO with bonuses,
and £3OO in Treasury Bonds. Although a
lawyer, he died intestate.
Captain Frederick Chapman, for half a
century a well-known man on the southern
coast, will pace the bridge no more. In the
old days he handled sailing-ships, and in
later days steamers of the Howard Smith
line, notably the Dawn and the ancient Julia
Percy. He was 88 himself at the end.
When Mary Powell died, aged 89,
at Byron Bay (N.S.W.) the other day. the
North Coast lost its genuinely oldest pioneer.
Born at Ryde (N.S.W.), the grand-daughter
of John Small, who was a non-commissioned
officer on the staff of Governor Hunter, she
was taken at the age of three from the city
to the big cedar country on the Clarence,
where her father and uncle verified the
stories of cedar riches told by the discoverer,
Richard Craig. After the red timber petered
out on the big river Small took up Wood-
ford Island as a cattle run in 1839, and was
the first white man to settle there. Thirty
years later his daughter, having- married G. R.
Powell, crossed the Richmond, a ! nd they
worked the great cedar vein in the Bangalow
district, where the family finally settled down
half a century ago.
Dominic Mangan, the veteran Rcdemp-
tonst, who died the other day, at 68, had
40 years of soul-salvaging in Australia. A
Drogheda native, he was included in the
second batch sent hither to found the Aus-
tralian Mission. A good deal of his time
was devoted to the study of the lower ani-
mals, on which he was something of an
authority.
R. G. McDowall, who recently retired
from the Queensland Lands Department,
had been surveying for 40-odd years. Al-
though he has been stationed in Rockhamp-
ton since 1808, in his time he has been in
practically every corner of Bananaland. He
completed the latitudinal and longitudinal
surveys of far-back Boulia in 1886 ami
never wanted to return. The 200 miles on
the Brisbane side of Boulia took him five
weeks to cover.
Drowned by the capsizing of his dinghy
in the surf at Orikolo, Papua, James Doyle
one of the best-known traders and pearlers
in Torres Strait
for 30 years. He
went down within
easy hail of the
plantation home
he had lately
acquired. Last
year the surf in
the same locality
claimed Adrian,
the previous
owner, and two
Papuans who were
with him.

SCHILSKY,

Conservatorium
(Harold Wylde

the piano).
“Bill Hosier”: Dugald Cameron, of Cam-
let, Bollon, provides another very bad advt.
for the climate of Queensland. He turned up
in the south-west-of the State about 70 years
ago, and he is now nearly 90. He confided
to me recently that he became a little stiff
after a long ride on horseback. (He is stjll
to be seen in the saddle in some of the
thickest mulga country in Queensland.)
Cameron is a smoker, and stoutly maintains
that there is no such thing as too much
whisky. His wife, who is still alive, was
for many years the only white woman with-
in hundreds of miles of their home. Of a
large family one daughter is the wife of Wm.
Boss Munro, of Boombah station, St. George,
and another recently married Lieut.-Col.
Murray, Y.C., etc., the doyen of A.I.F.
medal-collectors.
A niece of Edwin Markham, author of
“The Man with the Hoe,” is head of a de-
partment in one of Sydney’s big drapery
and furniture stores.
It required a contingent of 80 Federal and
State Labor members, including Ministers, to
secure the return of Bond to the Vic. Assem-
bly for Glenelg at the recent by-election. So
touch for the baby of the House. Down-
ward, who, in years, is the oldest member,
disdained any help froto his party at the
recent general election. Single-handed, he
fought five opponents in Mornington and
won. Thirty years ago, when Downward
first gained the seat, £ £ Smith, retiring
member whom he beat at the polls, petitioned
against his return. David Gaunson was
££’s counsel, and if there was one place
where he shone more than another it was be-
fore the Elections and Qualifications Com-
mittee ; but Downward fought his own case
and came off with flying colors.
Mrs. E. J. Dawson, 81, recently dead
at Invercargill (M.L.), Avas a daughter
of the first Avhite girl born in Hobart. Her
father, Col. Gateland, was one of the Speck's
early-day military chiefs. He later tried his
luck on the Yic. goldfields, where he is sup-
posed to have been murdered by convicts.
Mrs. Dawson married a son of the first
Borough Engineer of Invercargill (M.L.).
and left many descendants down to the third
generation.
“Fana”: These are the facts about Colin
Mackenzie’s retirement from the lecturing
staff of Melbourne ’Varsity (B. 21/8/’24).
After Mackenzie returned from the war, he
started to teach his students some of the
results of the researches conducted by him
in the Australian Institute of Anatomical
Research in Melbourne which he had
founded himself. These Avere so new and
far-reaching that they brought him into
conflict with some of the veterans who had
learned their medicine 30 years before. Then
was presented the spectacle of Mackenzie
being censured for his ideas—mostly in con-
nection with organothcrapeutics—at the
very time that honors were being showered
on him abroad for the same ideas. And
while Melbourne Uni, refused to accept his
teachings, the Royal College of Surgeons
cabled him an invitation to address it.
Similar invitations have been dropping in
ever since, and now Mackenzie’s name is
almost a household Avord in European and
American scientific circles, even though it
be scarcely known in the country of his
birth.
James Murphy, who finally shipped his
oars the other day, made something in the
vicinity of £40,000 by hiring out boats to
fishermen and romantic couples at Como
(N.S.W.) during a lifetime which ran to the
Psalmist’s span. Education gets the lot.
provided it is made available at the ’Varsity
for the sons of poor R.C.’s to gather up
sufficient science to work the land rightly.
THE OCTOGENARIAN’S PROGRESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I claim to be reasonably honest. No man 50
years old is absolutely honest.” —Witness in the
A.L.P. inquiry, Sydney.
As a child I was honest —in reason:
I’d pinch little trifles like jam
Or apples or peaches in season,
But wouldn’t make off with a pram,
Or collar a horse or a sulky,
Or break into houses by night
And rob them of articles bulky.
It didn’t appear to me right.
With manhood my views became broader
(A common phenomenon this) ;
In the phrase of a local recorder,
I’d steal anything from a kiss,
Or a mendicant’s paltry collection,
To the bullion that banks hide in vaults.
Our vicar expressed his dejection
At what he described as my “faults.”
But not till my years numbered fifty
Did my probity really decline.
Rich widows —-confiding, yet thrifty—
Were now often victims of mine.
I also forged freely, and uttered
The documents broadcast. “Dear me!
It’s shocking!” my relatives muttered.
“He’s ageing: that’s easy to see.”
By sixty, my technique perfected
And conscience and scruples quite dead,
I several murders effected,
And friends and acquaintances bled
By blackmailing post-cards and letters.
I now, I may mention, had known
The life of our gaols and their fetters,
And wholly dishonest had grown. .
I hope I may live to be eighty,
Which I hold to be crime’s golden age.
Malfeasances divers and weighty,
Befitting a white-bearded sage,
I'll perpetrate daily and nightly
Without any vestige of shame;
For .all of my years will be brightly
And busily doing the same.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES-LINSEED OIL
“Natara”: Tlie Papuan was a very in-
genuous person when the white foreigners first lobbed
into Moresby. When the Vanapa River gold rush was
on in 1898 a party of miners started out from Mores-
by on horses to try to get through to the golden
creeks. They travelled to the Goldie River and made
their camp not far from a tiny native village whose
head citizen gave them hospitable welcome, though
he looked askance at the strange animals on which
they arrived. At the warning of the
principal white man that he did not want his mounts
to bolt back to Moresby during the night, the worried
and rather scared villager assured him that if it was
left to him he would make dead sure the “man-
carrying dogs” would not get away. The tired
stranger accepted the assurance. “The old cove in
the crinkly hide ’ll sool his lads on to do sentry over
’em all night,” he told his mates. So the party
wrapped themselves around a meal of tinned dog and
biscuits and crept under the mosquito nets. Next
morning the miners found that their nags had fled
back to the coast during the night, and a little later
a shivering, terrified old sorcerer was explaining
things. “It is hot my fault,” he told them in
e/feet. “1 put two extra-powerful charms on each
side of the track, last night, but your ignorant animals
walked over them!” The old chap had tied the
grass across the pad and hung some parrot feathers
and a crocodile tooth on trees near by. The prospec-
tors walked back to Moresby for their horses.
* * * *
“Blue Bar”: When a man was getting
aboard a sulky about eight miles outside Dubbo
(N.S.W.) recently he suddenly dropped dead, pre-
sumably from heart failure. The horse moved
forward and dragged the sulky across a stump, where
it became fastened and was found bj 7 a search party
six days later, with the horse still between the
shafts. In the interval the prad had been exposed
to the not-too-good weather, and had to eat only the
grass it could reach in the confined space allowed
it by the immovable sulky. It had had no w'atcr,
and jet was little the worse for its experience when
found.
“A. Zed”: “VL7’s” remark (B. 24/7/’24)
about the newchum and the sheep’s teeth reminds
me of a Baron Von of Euroa (Vic.), who when
a new arrival in the country bought some sheep at
a. sale as three-year-olds. On his way home he
met a friend, who after examining the mouths of
one or two of the jumbucks exclaimed in mock indig-
nation, “Why, Baron, these sheep are as old as the
hills—they haven’t a tooth at all in their top
gums!” The Baron immediately set sail back to
the auctioneer, and when he arrived at his office
called him everything known in the English and
German languages for selling him sheep with broken
mouths.
* * * #
“Horodot”: Recently I was shown three
eggs of a bird whose identity is a mystery. They
were all solid and as
hard as stone. The
nest from which they
were taken was in a
crack between two large
rocks in the Kurra-
jongs, near Windsor
(N.S.W.), and had
obviously been deserted
for years. It was
constructed of twigs
laced together and
cemented with mud,
and various experts to
whom it was submitted
failed either to recog-
nise the birds that had
built it or to estimate
its age. The eggs were
slightly over an inch
long and a light yellow,
although this color was
probably due to age.
When one was broken
it split just like a
stone, and the surface
of the fracture was
smooth and a dark
streaky grey in color.
Petrified birds’ eggs
are not uncommon,
but it requires a tre-
mendous time for their
petrification, and the
age of these three could
certainly not be mea-
sured in geological
terms, while the presence of the nest also argued
against their being extremely ancient.
* * * «
Nitric”: “Tangalohi’s” par. on long rides
by horseback (B. 24/7/’24) reminds me of one an
old stockman cobber of mine did. He rode from
Turkeyville, 80 miles from Tenterfield, to Spoonup,
20 miles beyond, to marry his intended. The girl
in the case was a daughter of the pub owner, and
old Bill rode all Thursday afternoon and night, hoping
to next day wed the maid. He arrived on Friday
only to find his future ma-in-law’s superstition
wouldn’t allow a wedding that day; so Friday was
spent having “a helluvatime,” and that pub thrived.
Very early next morning the bridal knot was tied]
and off Bill started on the 100-mile honeymoon trip
home, with his wife on another neddy.
* * * *
‘ Taharangi”: I don’t believe that the
Maori dog ever saw a Spaniard (B. 24/7/’24) since
he trotted away from the ancestral home in N.
Africa at the heels of his megolithic master. There’s
nothing much in a few coincidences in' names.
“Veronal” may as well argue that, because the
Maori says “hekina” and the Roman said “achinus,”
Julius Caesar introduced the sea-urchin to Maori-
land. The dog was in M.L. long before Maori,
Spaniard or Caesar sailed the high seas. At the very
ancient settlement of Matakaea (Shag Point) in
Otago, history for thousands of years back is written
in shells and stones. On the top layer a Captain
Cook medal has been found; on the bottom, deep
down below the relics of Maori and pre-Polynesian,
have been unearthed the remains of the prehistoric
dog. He was a powerful brute, very broad in the
WITH ALL DUE DEFERENCE.
"Wha’s ’ee be raisin’ thy hat for, maate?”
“ ’USH! Caan’t ’ee see I be talkin’ to manager.”
head, and no friend to the aboriginal flint-man, who
hunted him for food. He disappeared with the
flint-worker, however, and the pre-Polynesians didn’t
keep a dog. But they told the Maoris, when the
latter arrived on the scene, that the wild recesses of
the bush were inhabited by ogres who hunted peace-
ful travellers with packs of hounds. So they knew
of the dog even though they didn’t patronise him;
in fact, the ancientry of the dog in the Pacific seems
to be established beyond all doubt. Why, the reason
for the Arawa canoe coming to the “long islands” in
the fourteenth century was that one gentleman killed
another gentleman’s perfectly good dog, thereby
precipitating a royal row; and after the canoe had
arrived a dog discovered Rotorua, the headquarters
of the Arawa tribe. Pact! You may see the
image of this benefactor carved on one of the great
posts of Tama-te-Kapua, the Big House of Ohinemutu.
* * * *
“Gouger” : In the bush many birds and
animals keep strictly about the little area of ground
where first they saw the good Aus-
tralian sun. Often I’ve curiously
noticed birds fly from their own home
creek towards a neighboring stream,
only to come volplaning back with
a squawking lot of furies at their tail
feathers. Similarly I’ve often seen
great flocks of galahs and cockatoos
regularly feeding on patches of grass-
seed along the banks of lagoons. There
might be another lagoon a few miles
away with its flock of birds; but
each flock keeps strictly to its own
feeding-grounds. Similarly with ani-
mals. When a man camps in a lonely
spot for any length of time, bandi-
coots, ’possums, squirrels, goannas,
snakes, etc., always hop along with
their visiting-cards. A man soon gets
to notice some distinctive spot on the
furry and scaly coats, and sees that
the animals seldom travel more than
a few acres from the spot where first
they pitched camp, whether it be a
hollow limb, log or cosy hole in the
ground. I suppose old Mother Bush
would get mixed up a bit if all the
birds and animals travelled about—
there’d be millions of live things in
some few miles of country and noth-
ing at all in thousands of other miles.
Without equal distribution, tucker
wouldn’t go around. A shrewd old
dame is Mother Bush.
* * * *
“.Tesmond”: Two young men rabbiting on
Phillip Island (Vic.) recently caught a doe which
had five young ones while she was in the trap. As
each one was a perfect specimen there was probably
nothing premature about it. Has such a thing
happened before?
* * * *
“Bioko” : When tailing lambs for a Vic.
cocky recently, I was told that if I tried my method
on a N. S. Wales sheep station I’d get the sack
at the first lamb, because I left about two inches
of tail. “The shorter you dock the tail,” said the
boss, “the less the bleeding.” Is this insane idea
prevalent in the Ma State?
“Taharangi ”; Of the 15 sounds comprising
the Maori phonology, the nearest approach to English
/ is the wli, which is pronounced half-way between
English f and Scotch wh. “VL7” (B. 17/7/’24)
implies that the incorrect spelling of place-names
in Otago is due to the adoption by the natives of
a sort of pidgin English. It is really due to the
pidgin Maori of the
early pakeha in those
parts, who could never
get his tongue round
certain Maori sounds.
A typical instance is
the word “korari,”
meaning a flax-stalk;
the elder generation of
Otago still says
“claddy-stick.” A s
regards the name of
Lake Monowai being
half Greek, as “VL7”
says—well, I dunno;
but listen. In the early
days the survey of a
large tract of country
was carried out by a
young classical scholar,
and he named the topo-
graphic features after
the mountains and
rivers of ancient Greece
and Rome. When the
maps arrived in the
offlee there was a snort
of indignation from a
dour Scottish chief sur-
veyor, and the young
man was told that such
nomenclature was friv-
olous, if not profane.
The disgusted junior
thereupon altered the
names to the Sowbura,
Kyeburn, Mareburn,
Jane’s Peak and other
horrors which appear
on the maps to-day;
but it is just possible
that he worked in a
Dago in the guise of a
Maori, and got Mono-
wai safely past the Old
Man. By the way, if
“VL7” is really fussy
about the pronunciation of Wakatipu, the correct
name is Whakatipu—Te Roto Whakatipu-Whenua, to
be precise.
* * » #
“Lily-Beale”: “Kurryjong’s” binghis (B.
3/7/’24) must be vastly different from their N.S.W.
brothers. I have never yet met one in this State
who could not hold his own with the average
white man as a swimmer. At Brewarrina I have
seen upwards of 50 coons in the water at the one
time, gins and piccaninnies included. The lubras
are always instructors to the young ’uns, and they
have a method which is somewhat .drastic. One gin
stands on the bank and heaves the small fry one
after another as far out in the water as she can;
and not until nearly exhausted are they given any
assistance. In this way they speedily learn to swim.
I have seen piccaninnies not more than five years
old who are as much at home in the water as
young teal.
THE BEREAVEMENT.
“I see they arrested old Bill fer ’avin’ no visible means
of support.”
“Go on! I never ’card ’is missus was dead.”
“Pinnacle”: If “Saaedi” (B. 31/7/’24) is
after dingo-destruction figures, I’ll vouch for this.
A big station in the Charleville (Q.) district took
delivery of 14,000 wethers and put them in a
paddock with dingoes in it. Three months later
a clean muster found only 9000. A couple of
dingoes on their honeymoon round these parts will
kill from 5 to 30 lambs in a night, to say nothing
of the havoc they can wreak in a flock of lambing
ewes—and these days lambs are potential 30 bobs.
“Geo Rich”; In the vicinity of Broomehill (W.A.)
lately a pair of dingoes had slaughtered 300 sheep
before they were trapped. Mrs. Warrigal’s footprint,
across the toes, measured three inches.
YANDILAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
How sadly droops the evening star
Above the roofs of Yandilar!
How stirless are the wilting leaves
That hang beneath the darkened eaves!
And absent is that ray of light
Which calls the pilgrim from the night.
From turmoil on the highways far
The wand’rer comes to Yandilar;
For here, in seasons dead and dim,
A smiling world was kind to him—
Back in the calm and careless days
When magic summits pierced the haze.
'The moon rides o'er a mountain crest;
Upon the homestead paddocks rest
The beams of melancholy light
Which seem to haunt the autumn night,
And formless shadows, dark and dread,
Steal warily by yard and shed.
No bleating calls of mustered sheep
Break on the pilgrim’s midnight sleep,
Where, off the track, he sprawls to wait
Chili daylight at the homestead gate.
No lusty song of other years
Calls forth a sudden storm of cheers.
The magpie voices near and far
Call up the sun on Yandilar;
And even as the pilgrim wakes
A beam of mellow sunlight breaks
To light the homestead porch, whose flowers
Shed fragrance in the treasured hours.
’Twas here his lost love tended well
The starry bud and blossom bell;
And here, at one long summer’s close,
She plucked for him her rarest rose
Before he turned and wandered far
By road and range from Yandilar.
A JERRY JOB.
“Astonishing financier, Job ki ns! Absolutely the architect of his
own fortune.”
“Hmm! Lucky for him that the building inspector didn’t come
round during the operation.”
The shy sun fires the seeding drills
Which creep across the harrowed hills,
And down the ruddy flats between
Lights up the rows of waking green
That in the harvest days ahead
May fall beneath the reaper’s tread.
The low sun tires and pales and chills
And lingers o’er the purple hills
What time the pilgrim sees, perchance,
Dim visions where the sunbeams lance
Faint mists that mount the range’s crest
Far, far within the drowsy west.
A chill wind stirs the sapless leaves
And whimpers ’neath the ruined eaves
Low dirges of the squandered past....
The wand’rer seeks the road at last,
While faintly falls the sun afar
Beyond the hills of Yandilar.

“Keyway” : I am on the side of those who
say that the goanna is not immune to snake poison.
In 1914, while fencing on a station in nor’-west
N.S.W., I saw a go. about 3ft. long get into an
argument with a black snake about the same
length as himself. The go. had his tail stuck
straight up in. the air, and was standing as high on
his toes as he could, and was at great pains to
keep the snake broadside on to himself. The
wriggler was only striking at the butt of the go.'s
tail, roughly between his hind legs, and the go.
was trying to get the snake about nine inches behind
the head. After about half an hour the go. made
a rush and dropped his rear appendage, and as
quick as chain lightning the snake struck him on
the butt of the tail. That goanni was a corpse
in less than 20 minutes. The snake didn’t last
much longer; his back was broken in two places—
I helped him to die with the fencing-shovel.
“Taharangi”: “Hayband” (B. 24/7/’24)
and his authority are quite right. Stcn3-swallowing
never formed part of the ritual of infant baptism
among the Maoris. The worthy author Ewes must
have heard something of the little-known whakangungu
ceremony whereby a tohunga was rendered proof
against any display of nasty temper on the part of
rival sorcerers. I know only one tohunga who has
really been fortified by this rite. My venerable friend,
Taua Tutanekai Haerehuka, of Rotorua, was the reci-
pient of the pill—a black, volcanic pebble, about
half an inch in diameter—and it was administered to
the budding wizard bj r his preceptor, Tuhoto Ariki,
the spiteful old person who caused the Tarawera erup-
tion in 1886 by invoking the spirit of Tama-o-Hoi,
the Demon of the Mountain. Tutanekai says that
the tapu stone was inserted into him with a view

“A. Zed” : Tell “Saaedi” (B. 24/7/’24) that
the term “hogget” should be applied only to a sheep
that has never been shorn before reaching the age
of one year. Lambs which have been shorn and
have been taken away from their mothers are
“weaners” until their two teeth appear. After hog-
gets” and “weaners” have been shorn, at from 14
to 16 months old, they generally have their two
teeth up, and then become “two-tooths.”

“Ragar”: Re the widespread belief that a
snake, being “cold-blooded,” is immune to the effects
of snake poison,
whether bitten by an-
other snake or by him-
self. I’ve just con-
vinced one Abo., by
actual demonstration,
to the contrary. The
blood of every snake
circulates like that of
every other vertebrate
possessing a heart. The
fact that its circula-
tion is slow, and docs
not produce sufficient
heat to render its body
appreciably warmer
than its habitat (one
reason, probably, for
its hibernating pro
pensity), does not
mean that the reptile
is totally devoid of ani-
mal warmth and feel-
ing. Let any Abo.
doubter open up the
next crawler he puts
out of action and see
for himself. He’ll find
tne heart placed pretty
far back, and he’ll find
that the blood is red
also that it is being
pumped through the
arteries. That being
so, poison introduced
by inoculation through
the poison-fangs of a
snake must circulate with the blood, reach the
heart, and stop its action.
“Ivunmurry”: Re “AdeL” and his wild
camels on the Mulligan River, and in the Birds-
ville (Q.) locality (B. 19/6/’24). I happen to know
that part of the country pretty well, and in
the last 15 years I have neither seen nor heard of
any camels wandering around loose, except a stray
one or two lost from a string. And these strays
are never free for long, as they are picked up by
some other string that happens along.
* * * *
“Lily-Beale” : Recent references to savage
horses bring to my mind a prad belonging to C.
Mayo, a second-hand dealer of Hurstville, near -
Sydney. According to its owner, it is better than
any watch-dog, and woe betide the person attempting
to “borrow” timber, of which there is a large
quantity in the yard. On the other hand, anyone
can approach the animal as long as Mayo him-
self is present. The same man has a cockatoo
68 years old, still quite gay and frisky, which will
always greet you with “Mr. Mayo’s cornin’, sir!”
* * * #
“X2X”: Recent mention of the queer medi-
cal knowledge of native races re-
calls that the inhabitants of New
Guinea and the other groups have
an intimate acquaintance with
more or less obscure phases of
chemical reactions. One instance
is the practice of mixing lime
with betel-nut when the latter is
chewed for its exhilarant effects.
The action of the nuts depends
entirely on the presence in them
of certain alkaloidal active prin-
ciples which are insoluble in ordi-
nary solvents. Hence were the
nut to be chewed by itself no
effect would be obtained from it.
But the alkaloidal bodies are pre-
cipitated in a soluble form by
alkalies, which is the reason why
the native mixes lime with the
nuts. How he came to know that
lirfie can be obtained from sea-
shells by calcining them is equally
mysterious, and since in each
case a well-defined chemical pro-
cess is involved, he could not have
hit upon the discovery simply
through a fluke. More likely is it
that such knowledge is an inheri-
tance from some ancient culture
which had studied these matters
and brought the fruits thereof
with the very early migrations into the Pacific Ocean
from Asia.

“Pic” : “Yes, I know there’s a mighty lot
of robberies and thefts go undetected in the city,”
said Sgt. Hanrahan to me in the Charge Room,
“but y’ can’t altogether blame the pleece. It’s largely
a matter of idintification. There’s any amount of city
people couldn’t idintify their own bedrooms if they’d
been newly papered. In the country it’s different.
I remember when I was in charge of a country station
old Paddy Holohan reported to me that he had lost
a pair of geese. More, he said that Joe Lawson
had them, and that he could idintify them. Joe
had a name for that kind of thing, but still I was
sceptical about the idintification. One grey goose is
very much like another. However, I went with Paddy
and had a look over Joe’s fence. There were half
a dozen geese in the yard. ‘Do you see your geese
there, Paddy?’ I asked him. ‘I do,’ says he, and he
was trying to point them out to me when Joe came
out of his back door. ‘What d’ye want?’ says he,
quite sour like. ‘We’re looking for Paddy’s geese
that’s been lost,’ says I. ‘Well, they’re not here,’
says Joe. ‘Yes, they are,’ says Paddy. ‘I can see
them.’ ‘There’s six geese there,’ says Joe, ‘and
ALL DONE FOR HER SAKE.
MRS. MCTUPPENCE: “Aren't you ashamed of yourself for allowing
me to pay my own fare in the tram?”
DUGALD MCTUPPENCE: “No, I thocht I’d give you a chance to
show off the lovely silk lining in your new handbag.”
I bought them. Here’s the receipt,’ and out it came.
It showed that Joseph Lawson had purchased half a
dozen geese at the local mart a week earlier. ‘Seems
to me ye’ve made a mistake,’ says I to Paddy, not
over-pleased with the laugh Joe had on me. ‘No, I
haven’t,’ says Paddy, ‘and I can prove it.’ I told
him he’d better begin at once, and he ran round to
the side gate and opened it. Then he whistled: a
low r encouraging sort of call, like he was teaching a
pup to answ’er. Two of the geese lifted their heads
at the first sound, then they left the flock in Joe’s
yard and followed Paddy home.”
* * * *
“S.C.” : Two interesting and beautiful Aus-
tralian parrots are rapidly approaching the border-
line of complete extinction. One is the ground-
parrot (Pezoporus wallicus ). It used to be flushed
in long grass and other cover about swamps and low-
lying ground on the far South Coast of N.S.W., but
has been practically wiped out in that quarter by the
combined agencies of foxes, domestic cats gone wild,
and the poisoned grain spread for rabbits. The other
is the night-parrot ( Geopsittacm occidentals), the
habits of which in many respects resemble those of
the ground parrot. Early last year E. L. Whitlock,
a skilled bushman and naturalist, undertook on behalf
of H. L. White, of Belltrees (N.S.W.), a journey
into the wilds of Centralia, in quest of the long-lost
night-parrot, and, although this rare bird was not
seen in the flesh, indisputable evidence of its exist-
ence was obtained. In one instance some abos. had
cooked and eaten a night-parrot which had been
driven by a fire out of porcupine grass only a little
while before Whitlock arrived. This bird, apparently,
excavates nesting tunnels, and the ground-parrot is
said sometimes to do the same, although in much
earlier days I found the eggs lying on the bare
ground.
“Nicanor”: “Rorom’s” remarks re out-
breaks of disease among native animals (B. 24/7/’24)
remind me of a terrible sickness that afflicted the
koalas in the Bundanoon (N.S.W.) district about
40 years ago, and swept the whole district like a
deadly plague. The bears were very numerous previ-
ous to the outbreak, but not one in a hundred
survived.
* * * *
“E.W.P.” : Fate waits for some of us in
strange ways. A bush-fire in the Deans Marsh
(Vic.) neighborhood left a large overhanging tree
just outside a farmer’s front gate so charred as
to become a menace to passers-by. The farmer
took his axe down with the intention of removing
the danger, and had just arranged his stand when,
on looking up, he discovered that a limb directly
above him was still burning. Fearing an accident,
he decided to leave it till next day, expecting
it to burn itself off during the night. Next morning
it still smouldered, and on the third morning it
was still' in position, though apparently the fire
had burned itself out. However, he decided to
give it one more day for luck, and went down on
the fourth morning to complete the job. He was
found a few hours later with the branch lying
across his neck, which was broken. The one slash
on the tree trunk indicated that the first stroke of
his axe had brought on him the fate he had so care-
fully tried to avoid.
* * * *
“Kowsara” : What is the record price for
a sheep-dog in Australia ? I am moved to ask
because an American buyer recently paid £175 for
a working sheep-dog, owned by a Scottish shepherd.
“Midford”: Rc unusual hybrids. Twenty-
one years ago the Le Souef who runs the Perth Zoo
had a bachelor lion and a widowed tigress for which
there were no available mates of their own species.
Reckoning that both the beasts and the Zoo might
profit by a period of intimacy, he introduced the
lion into the tigress’s cage. The intruder might
have been successful in making himself agreeable if
he had been given a fair spin; but he never got one
—the lady fell on him and killed him before the
attendants could interfere. Le Souef came in for
a lot of criticism because he had sacrificed a valuable
animal in what some of the fault-finders reckoned a
“fool experiment,” but he retorted that every intelli-
gent zoologist knew perfectly well that there was
precedent for a lion-tiger cross. What recalls the
incident to me, and shows Le Souef was perfectly
right, is the picture in recent English papers of the
first of these hybrids that has ever appeared in the
London Zoo. It was bred in captivity from an
African lion and a Bengal tigress by the Maharaja
of Nawanagar (“Ranji”) and has gone where more
people can study it at close range than in India.
Queer things, these mules of the great cat tribes.
* * * *
“Nawoc”: If the assertion of “Parama”
(B. 3/7/’24) and of his oldest “boy” that dugong
are very rare in northern waters is true, then I had
rather a unique experience a few months ago, inas-
much as I whs among a school of approximately 40
or 50 between Dunk Island and the mainland. This
is about half-way between Townsville and Cairns —-
and I wouldn’t like to have to walk the distance from
the Barrier Reef before breakfast.
* * * *
“Gouger” : The niggers on Cape York Pen-
insula occasionally get even with their ancient enemy
the ’gator. In a very dry season the big crawler is
sometimes left far inland by reason of a chain of
waterholes drying up. As each hole gives out he
lobs across to the next one, and so on. When the
last hole dries, the homeless ’gator grimly girds
his loins and treks across dry land, often for a
considerable distance, to the nearest lagoon or river.
The niggers (who have long read the “writing
on the mud”) patiently await this inevitable trek,
and when the overlander has reached some point on
firm ground which is covered with long, dry grass,
they fire the grass in a circle around him. The
saurian quickly loses his head and rushes from point
to burning point in the fast-narrowing ring of flames,
and at last, when the fire closes in upon him and he
is practically blinded by the smoke, he rolls over
as the flames lick his belly. That is the critical
moment: the niggers rush in and fill his comparatively
thin under-skin as full of spears as a porcupine is
of quills.
* * * *
“E.D.” : The peace and cpiiet of the shear-
ing shed at Boolrandle was suddenly disturbed by a
violent altercation between two shearers. The young-
est man on the board had attacked the eldest with-
out. any apparent provocation, and was giving him
what for. The old man fought back gamely, but
had no show against his youthful and capable antag-
onist ; so the shed tore the lad off while it explained
to him what it thought of the cow who would
attack a man old enough to be his father. “That’s
just it,” replied the youth ; “I’ve been saving that
hiding up for him for 20 years, but he’s kept out
of my way. He is my father.”
EXCEEDING THE BIRTH LIMIT.
MRS. GRUTCH: “An’ you say you useter
know Charlie? Ah, there was a hoy!
He was one son in a thousand!”
STRANGER: “Lor’, mum! I ’ad no idea you
’ad so many!”
“Panehaz”: The male scrub-turkey carries
the young birds from a place of danger by simply
taking them one at a time on his back and hurrying
away through the grass and undergrowth. Chickens
nearly as big as a fowl are carried in this manner.
If startled the old bird will rise from the ground
and fly away, keeping low over the undergrowth. The
young bird generally manages to hang on during the
flight, but should it fall off it has no difficulty in
landing safely. The hen does not take part, except
on rare occasions, in transporting a brood, but
leaves the business entirely to the old man, who is
an adept at it.
THE LAST OF THE KILLERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Of the killers whose exploits once made famous
the whaling of Twofold Bay, most have died or
departed, the chief that remain being Old Tom and
Hookey.”
Have they gone to glory, one by one,
The killers of Twofold Bay?
Is the sport of the sea-dogs dead and done,
Has whaling had its day ?
Will harpoons never again make play
Where the bull-whales rise and roar,
Nor the boats go out for the blubber fray—
Where are the killers of yore ?
Where’s Stranger and Kinchen, each sea-son,
Humpy and Cooper? Say,
Where have they gone ? Of the sleuths there’s none
But Hookey and Tom that stay.
Have they flapped their fins and sailed away
To drive to a spectral shore
The spooks of whales with two tongues for prey?
Where are the killers of yore?
“Was it the fear that a silly gun
Instead of the harpoon’s way,”
Said Hookey to Tom, “would spoil their fun?”
But Old Tom answered, “Nay!”
Though his seven-foot fin W'as turning grey,
He scanned the seas, and swore!
“They’re on strike, the blighters !” and lashed the
spray—
Where were their mates of yore?
Envoy.
But Old Tom and Hookey, come what may,
On sentry-go as before,
Still watch for the spouting whales that stray—
But where are the killers of yore?
VICTORIA.

GAS FOR POWER, LIGHT ind HEAT
OBTAINED FROM BROWN COAL
by
The Lilford Patent Double Zone Gas Producer
This result never previously obtained
in Australia.
The double-zone Producer gives First-quality Gas from one
zone and produces Heavy Oils, Light Oils and Petrol with
the second zone —20 to 35 gallons of these oils can be
obtained per ton of dry coal treated.
THE OIL POSSIBILITIES ARE TREMENDOUS.
First-quality Gas for Town Lighting can be produced for
about 2/- per 1000 cubic feet.
BROWN COAL is procurable at 7/6 per ton.
Maitland Coal costs up to 42/- per ton in Victoria or S. Aus.
This means that millions upon millions of tons of hitherto
useless fuel is now available for cheap power and lighting
purposes. The huge benefit to Australia and Australian
Industries must be computed in millions of pounds sterling.

St. Kilda citizens evidenced their appre-
ciation of Mayor Allan and his acting
Mayoress, daughter Merle, by packing the
local Civic Hall for the return ball. Town
Clerk Chamberlain had employed his artistic
genius for weeks beforehand devising an
original setting for the frivol. Bougainvillaea
and ruby lights jewelled the room, and there
was a twinkling of blue globes interlaced
with silvery blue leaves, while Orientally-
shaded lights dipped over a mammoth silver
cobweb guarded by a big black spider. The
youthful Mayoress, an opalescent beaded
glitter, with a rosy sash, came up brightly
to the occasion when the chairman, Council-
lor Barnett, drove her to voice her thanks
for oratorical and other favors received. (The
brown-eyed damsel, before coming to the ball,
had rushed to the private hospital where
Mrs. Fred Chamberlain was sitting up and
looking pleasant after being weeks on the
sick list, and thereby missing her first mayoral
function for many years.)
A chucklesome item comes from Launces-
ton, The other night the social elect turned
up to the evening party in connec-
tion with the Royal Society’s show
in tlieir very gladdest decolletes and
boiled shirts —then nearly lifted the roof
with their snorts of indignation when the
Lieut.-Governor arrived on a wave of “God
Save,” not in black tailorings, but in a rain-
proof buttoned up to the teeth!
Owing to the ill-health of the bride’s
mother, none but relatives and an extra-
special friend or two were called in to see
Jessie Doreen Campbell and Reginald Ritchie
exchange their vows in the Collins-street
kirk last Thursday evening. When Major
Charlie Campbell led his daughter to the
•sacrifice she looked as if she had stepped out
of an Early-Victorian illustration in full
flounced skirts of filmy lace under her bridal
veil. Sister Madge ’maided in mauve maro-
eain and a black lid, and J. W. Campbell
best-manned. Healths were drunk at the
Hotel Windsor, where the floral dressings
called for admiration. The Tom' Ritchies, of
Mornington, were there, of course, to wel-
come their newly-made daughter-in-law.
Haslemere, the East St. Kilda Johnsons’
home, suffered a joyous upheaval the other
night, when daughters Gwynneth, Joyce and
Cecily combined to hostess a jazz evening
under the chaperonage of their mother. The
latter tackled the agreeable job in cloth-of-
gold hangings. Daffodils nodded in the re-
ception parlors, from a backing of pussy
willow and scented boronia, while bobbing
balloons were afloat where the supper sand-
wiches and trifles tempted. Gwen whirled
like living fire in flame-colored velvet, Joyce
glittered like Lohengrin, and Cecily colored
her silvery drapings with tender green. The
trio, whose mother was a Geelong G Wynne,
are cousins to heiress Verna, now tripping
overseas under the maternal wing.
Congratulations are being unloaded upon
Eileen Good on her appointment as demon-
strator in architecture at the Melbourne
Varsity. Being first is becoming a habit
with her—she was the first woman to obtain’
the Diploma of Architecture in Melbourne,
the first to be admitted an associate of an
institute of architects in the Empire (she
got in just a couple of weeks before a Sydney
woman),. and the first of her sex to receive
an appointment in that line at Melbourne
Lni. She is the daughter of an Anglican
parson of the old school.
The Andrew Loughnan widow’s second
daughter, Eileen —she shelters with a mater-
nal aunt, Miss McLean, in Sydney—has
just confessed to intending matrimony with
a visiting Englishman, Major Hawkins, who
was with the 17th Lancers in the war. Fol-
lowing the orange-blossoming (not yet dated)
the pair will go to live on the other side
of the Equator. The Loughnan daughters
have all inherited good looks from their
parents, who are said to have been the hand-
somest Melbourne couple of their day. (The
matron is still one of the best-lookers in
Toorak.) The youngest girl is married to
Dr. Eddie Spowers, of the Akgus Spowers
tribe.
The wife of the late Speaker Frank
Madden went over the hill last week. For
many months she had been chained by ill-
health to the South Yarra home where she
and her unmarried daughters settled after
disposing of roomy Mooroolbark at Kew.
The kindly, well-liked matron was a daugh-
ter of a former Premier, the late J. G.
Francis. As a young woman she was noted
for her prowess in the hunting field, where
she was known as “The Lady in Blue. Her
only son, Goodall, and her eldest daughter,
Lyle, inherited the maternal love and are
both keen followers of hounds. Two married
daughters live in the country—Mrs. Hind-
liaugh at Moulamein (N.S.W.), and Mrs.
Bourchier at Strathmerton.
Before the curtain disclosed “The Rise of
Rosie O’Reilly” on Saturday the Princess’s
Theatre suggested a grand-opera premiere,
dozens of the Very Best punctuating the Heb-
rew and sporting throng which nowadays
crowd out first nights. Mrs. Hugh Ward
came along with Dot Brunton’s mother, Mrs.
J. J. Brenan and daughter Jennie. Barbara
Hoffe, who has not steamed back to her
native Fog according to schedule, arrived
with her husband, Tom Oakshott. Even
Allan Wilkie dropped in to study musical
comedy at the fountain-head. The Barry
Thompsons were boxed with John Fuller and
daughter Phyllis, while Douglas Calderwood
sat with a group of pals in the opposite pen.
The dressing of the show almost reaches the
sensational in quantity and quality, though,
truth to tell, the brown hooped chorus in
the grand finale, with squaw head-dresses like
pyramids of fruit, rather let down the. pre-
vious orgy of colorful beauty. The dominant
color-note was, of course, rosy-—and, inciden-
tally, frilly. But hooped skirts don’t lend
themselves to the graceful gyrations of a
chorus. If they are asked for, then the hoop-
ings should be modelled on tbe subtle curves
of the old-time crinoline, not on the lines of
a barrel. Dot Brunton looked her sweetest
in the little brown dress of her Bowery day,
and her brown velvet tarn fitted her charms
to perfection. Her least becoming frock was
the last, blue-hooped and fronted with silver
embroideries. Her most gorgeous garb was
also hooped—gold tissue flounced with metal
lace and having colored entanglements. The
prettiest of all was of maize silk holding a
key-patterned hem of many colors. This was
fronted with white frills and topped off by
a snowy fichu.
Dr. and Mrs. Atkinson Wood, of Metung,
will part with their second daughter, Nancy,
shortly to Kenneth Davis, second son of the
E. M. Davises, of the Ma State. Another
second daughter who has booked for the
matrimonial journey is the Western District
Willie Moffatts’ Mary, who has promised to
link up with Keith Calvert, son of the late
L. G. Calvert, of Dreeite, and of Mrs C.
Darcy.
Mrs. George Haines is the little matron
who recently put up a fine performance as
musical director of the Egyptian revue in the
Prahran Town
Hall, for the
Alfred Hospi-
tal. She was a
Geelong girl,
Olive Keown,
and got most
of her musi-
cal training
there under
Prof. Austin.
After taking
Royal Acad-
emy and Lon-
don College of
Music degrees,
and becoming
an Associate
of Trinity Col-
lege, London,
she launched
out on the con-
cert platform
at the mature
age of 17 or
so. Then matrimony intervened, but she
lias never slowed down her studies. She
is equally skilled as a pianist, singer and
organist, and specialises in the Margaret
Cooper type of work. The little matron
should have printer’s ink in her blood, as a
great-grandfather wrote a dictionary, and
an uncle owns and edits the Examinee in
the Isle of Man; while her brother, A. W.
Keown, who looks after the advertising side
of the Vie. railways, lately published a
book, “Forward with the Fifth,” and is an
occasional Bulletin contributor. But
Mrs. Haines’s writing so far has been con-
fined to songs, of which she has already
turned out several bright samples, and has
two more in the making. Lafayette took
the photo.
What look like Melbourne’s last hopes of
a massive and imposing war memorial were
extinguished by the answer which Premier
Prendergast gave a deputation the other day.
A grandiose scheme for a commemorative
building, to cost a quarter of a million or so,
was approved by a number of optimists long
since, but a pitifully small amount was col-
lected, and out of that£2soohas been disbursed
in prize money for designs. Recently some-
body remembered that Government assistance
had been promised; the upshot was a request
to the State’s newest Administration to hand
over £50,000 as an encouragement to the
public to subscribe the rest. Prendergast
flatly declined, and as everybody realises that
the project, now that war enthusiasms have
cooled, is hopeless, his attitude is widely com-
mended. Anzac House is a kind of war
memorial. It cost £74,000; the returned sol-
diers are asking for the right to make a
special appeal next Anzac Day to wipe out
the debt of £25.000. Perhaps the Govern-
ment may be willing to find a trifle for that.
Feminine card flutterers had a breathless
day out on Thursday, when the National Coun-
cil of Women’s appeal fund was strengthened
by a Toorak party in two helpings. The
afternoon portion was consumed in the
Edward Miller dame’s red-roofed place,
Glynn, and the evening slice in the Bertie
Austins’ parlors at Eilyer. The profits were
further weighted by the takings from a
flower stall and a gaily-beribboned lolly dis-
pensary. The Gilbert Lodge and Alfred
Bright matrons starred as flower-sellers,
while the Best lady looked after the choco-
late brigands. Dozens of the Best Known
were among the foursomes gathered round
the green beiged tables, and most of the
players had put on their Sunday best for the
double event. The Miller and Maudsley
dames, aided and abetted by Mrs. Ernest
Poolman, Mrs. Henry Cave, Mrs. Bertie
Austin and the silver-haired Millie Carter,
were chief conspirators in launching the
money-raising sliivoo, while Linda Inglis did
good work with the lion, secretary’s pen.
This is a Broothorn photo of Bernard
Heintze, the young South Aus. fiddler who
returned to Melbourne in 1923 after 13 years
of Europe. He went away as a Clarke
scholarship winner for three years at the
London Col-
lege of Music,
saw a lot of
active service
as a gunner
officer, went
to Gibraltar as
A.D.C. to the
Governor, Sir
Harry Guth-
rie, put iu two
years in Paris
as a Goisland
Harrison
sch o 1 a rshp
winner under
Vincent d’lndy,
and then flit-
ted to Berlin,
where he was
taken on as a
private pupil
by Joachim’s
famous protege
Willy Hess. A
cabled invitation to adjudicate at last year s
South-street Eisteddfod brought him back
to Australia, and as he finds his homeland
much to his liking he is in no hurry to
leave it. The local ’Varsity having beckoned
him in to the staff, he has now linked up
with Hattenbaeh and Goll. The trio are
giving a series of Melba Hall recitals and
will also tour the bigger country towns under
the auspices of the Conservatorium.
Margaret Mclntyre, a 24-year-old Win-
chelsea girl, has left scores of grieving friends
in Melbourne and the Western District. She
was a daughter of the widowed Mrs. Andrew
Mclntyre, of Merdaduke, and was staying
with the R. L. Tuomeys at Hamilton for
the hunting event on the lvinvonvie estate.
There is no doubt about her skill as a horse-
woman ; but her mare, Ruby, a noted show-
hunter, blundered badly, and rolled on her
rider, who was later found to have a broken
neck.
When ex-State Treasurer McPherson re-
turns from his world tour in October, he will
be disappointed to find that all anyone has
done towards providing the Domestic Econ-
omy College, for which he has paid in ad-
vance, is to set apart the site. The college
is to be erected on portion of the land
whereon the just-vacated Melbourne Gaol
stands. When McPherson handed then
Premier Lawson £20,000 in bonds in
February; last, the latter talked largely about
an opening ceremony when the generous
giver returned; but it will be months before
even a foundation-stone will be ready.
Plowever, McPherson knows something of
the Government stroke. Even when he
cracked the whip he got little more than a
momentary jump in the departments.
Joan Elizabeth, the elder of Tasmanian
Major-General John Gellibrand’s daughters,
has prettily extended her left hand, and
allowed Denis Battershill, only son of the
Battershills of Wood Hall, Falmouth (Eng.),
to slip the usual circlet on her engagement
finger. The wedding will take place towards
the end of October from Boos Hall, Beccles,
Suffolk, the home of Joan’s auntie, Mrs.
Fred Robinson. Joan’s father flashes, in
addition to a K.C.8., a well-earned D.S.O.
The often-abused trustees of the Felton
Bequest deserve a good word for recent pur-
chases hung in the Stawell Gallery. There
are five pictures, and the only poor one is
Wilson Steer’s water-color, “Uplands,” which
is mediocre and amateurish work. “Pieta,”
a Memling, is a small canvas, lOfin. x 7fin.,
but it cost 12,500 guineas, and is probably
worth the money. Dated 1474, it was pro-
duced when the artist was at the zenith of
his power, the crucified Christ and His mourn-
ing mother being beautifully painted. Titian’s
“Friar” took 7950 guineas out of the Trust,
Sargent’s “Hospital at Granada” 2205, and
a highly dramatic Daumier 1400 guineas.
Bob Knox and his wife set out the other
night to lighten the social depression with a
listening-in party at their Toorak home,
Greenknowe. However, owing to a failure of
the mechanism, the thrilling possibility of
snaring a message from Mars went phut; so
the pair ordered in a lleet of taxis and took
their guests to St. Kilda for a night-out on
Carlyon’s dance floor.
Winnie Collins wears a series of entrancing-
frocks in “A Night Out” at Her Majesty’s.
The opening revelation suggests a cooing
dove —misty grey georgette, with tricky little
front pockets, no sleeves and a dash of white
modestly outlining the collar-bones. A
filmy coatee heavily weighted with fur at its
extremities, accompanies her on her entrance
and exit. The lady arrives at a successful
issue to her love worries in the duckiest little
dress of shell-pink, side-curtained with gos-
samer, and having sasliings of deep blue and
yellow bunched together like twin cabbages
on one hip. This is topped with a semi-
shovel hat of pale mauve, wreathed with a
deeper color, and having a pink rose posing
against a mauve chou on the left ledge, while
follow-me-lad streamers hang down her back.
Act 2 reveals a jazz frock of primrose, shim-
mered over with glittering, beaded panels,
and a silver-tissue cloak, heavily fringed at
the hem, showing mauve sandwiched between
two shades of green in the silken lining.
Lilian Stott, just back from two years of
Europe, staged her opening recital iti the
Assembly Hall, before a large and interested
musical gathering, and displayed a soprano
of fine quality. A quartette of mid-century
songs, backed by Gertrude Healey’s violin,
introduced some rich lower notes, and Char-
pentier’s “Depuis le jour” illustrated the
flexibility of the voice, though it showed the
upper notes to be more sweet than powerful.
Gertrude Healey’s brace of solos disclosed
an increase in temperamental weight
which has long been looked for, and Ida
Scott’s accompaniments called for admiring-
comment.
George Brooke and Teddy Cahill continue
to rush from one London triumph to another.
On October 25 George will make his first
big concert-platform appearance at the
Albert Hall, where he will sing some melo-
dies specially made for him by composer
Roger Quilter, who raves over the sympa-
thetic quality of the Australian’s voice. Roger,
by the way, is a brother of the big Major
who decorated our ex-G.-G. Denman’s group
of helps. His sister, Mrs. Fred Venn am.
has lent her expensive country homestead to
Brooke and Cahill for a two-months’ rest
while she suns herself on the Continent.
Mrs. George James, the Australian ex
Commander of the second division of
W.A.A.C.’s to cross to France, is again in
England with her husband, and has a flat in
the same building as her former musical
proteges.
Some Adelaide gossip :
From London comes news that one of Labor’s candi-
dates at the next elections will be Mrs. Porter,
better known in this State as Muriel Matters, who
served her ’prenticeship to English politics as a suff-
ragette and was here on a lecturing- tour a year or
so ago. Her job will be to win the Hastings seat
from its present Unionist holder, one of the Percy
clan.
The Y.W.C.A. is out on its annual quest for funds:
hence the two days’ Blue Triangle Fete opened at
the Town Hall by Mayoress Glover, it is a hard
job to invest a fete with novelty these days, but
the Christian young women struck two new ideas.
One was a series of lantern slides showing the
working of the association (cheaper than a cinema
and far easier to take), and the other a children’s
party for small things of from three to eight, to
which much of our infant population turned up bring-
ing a maternal parent with it.
Few departed viee-regals keep a warmer place in
their hearts for the bit of Australia they’ve lived
in than the Weigalls, and their houses in London
and Lincolnshire are sure meeting-places for South
Australians. June saw two receptions at their
place in Park-lane, with Royalty at both of them
(Princess Beatrice at one and Princess Louise at
the other), and a big sprinkling of well-known Lon-
doners to help in giving the glad hand to Aus-
tralian guests. Among the Londoners were the
Grey Egertons (she was a Tennant and married her
A.-D.-C. husband while he was on the Kintores’
staff) and the Galways, who, like the Weigalls, still
count themselves partly South Australians.
Half a dozen hosts (among them Evan Kyffin
Thomas, S. A. Savery and O. von Rieben) bade the
members of the S. Australian Grand Opera Co. to the
Liberal Union rooms the other evening, when they
made merry with dancing and a song or two, supper
(whereat the cheques from the benefit performance
were handed over to the Fillipinis and the Harold
Gards) and a few speeches. The co.’s present to
the conducting Countess was given at the theatre
after the final performance—a baton and a wristlet
watch. The Gards (she is still best known as Vera
Thrush), who were the stars of the season, are
bound for Europe for further study; so is Kitty
Spehr—dark-eyed, charming and 21 —of whose voice
Fillipini predicts great things.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-
Kayser
GLOVES
The girl in the flat opposite said she was
off to buy a new hat. This was on that
morning last week when the westerly was
puffing little slivers of ice between your top-
coat and your spine. She said it didn’t mat-
ter about her Marcel being limp and her
nose working up pink through the layers of
powder, because if she could look decent in
a Spring hat under those conditions she’d
look perfectly ravishing in it when Septem-
ber skies were blue and the sun warmed up
a bit. By this time a sinuous showroom
lady without a pick of flesh on her —you
know, the absolute last-word in correct figures
—was directing our attention to Spring hats.
These were for the most part of the kind
called cloche—which means a snug fit and a
slight variant of the inverted-bowl architec-
ture —made of Bankok straw or straw of
many colors twisted together into raffia-like
effects.
Brown in all its shades chanted on every
side. The girl from the flat oposite says it
looks as though it’s going to be so much
worn that by mid-summer nobody will be
seen in it. Lots of the hats had dangles of
ribbon bows, shorter than last summer’s,
and one Bankok straw of yellow had a trail
of corrugated red ribbon emerging from a
Petersham band at intervals round the crown.
A turban of sky-at'ter-raiu blue marocain
caught together in front with a crescent-
shaped paste buckle caused the trier-on to
gurgle with delight—till she saw the price-
ticket. Then she put it down hastily: it
reminded her of Turkish atrocities among the
Armenians. One leaf-brown crinoline lined
in with gold georgette had around its shal-
low crown a spray of anemones, of vary-
ing tones of pink, moulded of shells! These
make an ethereal decoration, and none but
the best hats, so far, carry them. But
Sydney women are clever, and even while the
girl was exclaiming over the perfection of a
leafy pale-green hat her eye and finger were
busy measuring up two languorous water-
lilies of shell upon its brim. The small
ribbon pull-on is still with us. A blue one
of these carried a pearly grey pigeon’s wing
slanting down to the right shoulder; but
the correct things, of course, for golf or
tennis, or morning wear with linen frocks, as
Madame informed us, are the soft little
pull-on straws of many colors. You can buy
dozens of them for three and a half guineas
—each.
Hymen, buckling to once more after taking
a rest cure, had a heavy time during the
week just gone. Among those he fitted with
fetters at the various clerical locksmithies
were Maybelle Olive Henson, of Collaroy, and
Edwin Jeanneret, of Hunter’s Hill. St.
Philip’s, dressed in palms and white lilies,
blessed the linking, and bridegroom’s uncle
Canon Bellingham drove the last screw home.
Quite a stir was caused by the leap into
the sea of matrimony made by Dora
McDougall, of Potts Point, and Keith Davi-
son, son and heir of the Davisons of Cun-
ningham Plains, Harden. St. John’s, at Dar-
linghurst, turned up all its electrics for the
pretty evening wedding; and, helped by the
joyous song of white-robed choristers, the
two were made one by Padre Lucas. After-
wards, while the register was being signed,
Rene Forsayth let the audience into the
secret of the alliance by a tuneful rendering
of “The Reason.” The bride was one of
the popular McDougall sisters, who cleverly
managed a house-agency for some time, and
the church had been turned into a bower by
a host of girl friends, who occupied the
front pews and murmured commendation as
Dora’s cloth-of-silver frock, with its foamy
train of silver lace, hove in view. An ex-
quisite veil of Limerick lace, loaned by Mrs.
Rex Middleton, added glamor to the dazzling
whole. Bride’s sister Jessie and ’groom’s
sister Laura were colorful adjuncts in
hydrangea-blue and silver. Rhys Jones and
Stanley Davison stood by the ’groom.
There was a linking-up of two extensive
clans last week, when Gwynnetli Faithfull,
daughter of the medical R. L. Faitlifulls,
took Guy Ray ward, of Scone, for better or
worse. The wedding was an afternoon affair,
and a Spring sun drenched St. Mark’s as the
bride flashed her ivory moires and filmy
tulles up the pathway. Bride’s sister
Helen, cousin Valerie and Clarice Faithfull
Anderson, with two small nieces of the
bridegroom, Phyllis and Patricia Giblin,
’maided, looking like a bunch of Iceland pop-
pies in their yellow to tangerine georgette
frocking. Eric Campbell —lie looked like a
complete guide to matrimony—best-manned.
Eater on the bride’s mother and father dis-
pensed wedding meats at their Edgecliff home,
where the decorations were of poppy and
daffodil gold.
The welkin about St. Mark’s, Darling
Point, rang again when Lorna Litchfield, of
Springwell, Cooma, said “I will” to John
Wilkinson, of Stratlifield. It was one of
the most richly upholstered knots of the
week. The bride’s frock was of ivory moire
brocaded with gold leaves, fluffing at the
hem into a crop of white marabout and
ostrich feathers. The train was of the latest
design, sculped fan-wise from a panel in the
frock. Three maids in ivory and gold rounded
off the group in beauty; and Vernon Allen,
of Cooma, and the bride’s brother as male
supports combined utility and a bright appear-
ance. About 150 attended the reception at
the Queen’s Club.
St. Mark’s housed yet another pretty
wedding during the week when Joyce Strang,
now of Castle Hill —she’s the youngest chick
of the John Strangs, till lately of Allendale,
Inverell—became Mrs. Pearson Suttor, of
Bathurst.
Bobbie (Margaret Hazel) Boss-Munro, of
Brisbane, has just proclaimed her engage-
ment to Clive Ronald Reid, a son of the
globular comedian who brightened Austra-
lia’s Parliamentary life for so many years.
An entry for the Matrimonial Stakes has
been made also by Joyce Yates (Braidwood)
and Alec Sanders (Double Bay).
Pathologist Oliver Latham, of the Sydney
Uni., has circled the correct finger of Mar-
jorie Parr with a diamond lasso. Marjorie
is a nice girl who lives at Eastwood and is
much interested in C. of E. uplift work.
Lewisham has had its great day in honor
of its Mother-Provincial and her silver
jubilee in Australia. In the morning there
was Pontifical High Mass in the chapel, at
which ceremony Archbishop Kelly and Dr.
Sheehan, with bishops and high prelates
from various States, officiated. In the
afternoon the foundation-stone of the
new chapel—a sorely-needed addition —
was laid. When Mother Xavier first
took charge of Lewisham it was a small
building of two wings, and its patients were
women and children. Now the general and
the private hospitals cover all available
ground, and any further extensions will have
to be made upwards. Mother Xavier, who
has the manner of an ambassador with the
brains of a statesman, had the notable dis-
tinction of being called to the first Vatican
conference at which the counsel of woman
was invoked.
The lady in this New Talma picture is
Mrs. A. J. Studdy, of Emerald Hill, president
of the Country
Women’s Asso-
c i a t i o n.
Until M r s.
Hugh Munro
resigned a
week or two
ago she was
senior vic e-
president, and
showed fine
o r g a nising
ability in
allying the
C.W.A. with
other primary
producers’ or-
gani sations;
and the provi-
sion of sepa-
rate counters
for women
and children
at railway re-
f res h men t-
rooms was mainly due to her well-directed
agitation.
In the Women Painters’ rooms one even-
ing last week the covers of many an old-
time Dickens novel were opened, and out
stepped the characters that have made a
world laugh and weep. Aubrey Halloran,
president of the fellowship, lent the support
of Buzfuz’s arm, as well as his legal know-
ledge, to his old client, Mrs. Bardell. In
Mrs. Chickenstalker, who carried off first
prize for her interpretation, old-friend Peg-
gotty of last year was recognised. Augustus
Snodgrass got mixed up with his period,
and wore a pretty Dolly Varden on his arm
most of the evening. Mr. Winkle and Susan
Nipper and Dot Peerybingle made one
another’s acquaintance. Florence Dombey
was a prize-winner; so was Mr. Crummies.
Mrs. Mantalini forsook her mangle for one
evening, and issued forth in her fichus and
sprigged muslins. Shyly hanging on to a
grown-up hand, a very ungrown-up Little
Em’ly proffered a bouquet to Nell Stewart,
who dropped in to award the prizes and win
the envy of every woman, old or young, for
her slim figure and her pretty arms. Agnes
Connor was secretary of the flutter.
One wonders why the powers of the Hor-
dern Galleries didn’t turn Frank Lynch’s
Satyr's back to the young ladies in Dora
Wilson’s pastels. A six-foot-high partition
with two wide openings through which the
bold, bad creature has an unrestricted view
is no protection for the damsels in undress.
And Dora’s subjects are such nice girls, too.
Even the ones with the lightest cargo of
clothes, you can tell, have been finished at
young ladies’ colleges and have taken courses
of the most expensive physical culture. Dora
mostly paints back-views of the female form,
but to prove they are all there she occa-
sionally turns them centre-front or sideways
on. But in every case they have that nice
little inward slope under the ribs—where
the bagginess occurs in a thin young man’s
waistcoat —and their hips are of the flat, col-
lapsible kind rather than the ■globular, as
favored by the Norman Lindsay ladies, who

on the same side of the partition as the goat-
shanked merrymaker.
Say how do you do to Charles Wilson,
Parliamentary librarian and booklover of
Maoriland. His
knowledge of
the written
word is stu-
pendous : you
can get only a
hint of it from
his two pub-
lished volumes
of “Rambles in
Bookland.” He
is an advisory
dire ctor of
the Alexander
Turnbull Li-
brary, and that
is claimed to
be one of the
finest in the
world. In addi-
tion to his
knowledge o f
books he has
a discriminat-
ing judgment
in art matters, is a collector of book plates,
and lias been feasting upon the treasures of
Sydney galleries and junk-shops for the last
few weeks. The photo was made by May
Moore.
Talking about hips and the curves of other
days and the tubular anatomy of the minute,
there seems to be an unconscious conspiracy
among fancy-costume creators and hirers-out
to coax the female form into any and every
sort of trousered character that ever strode
or tripped through the ages. That is the
reason any fancy-dress dance or carnival
abounds with pages, Boy Blues, jazz pierrots,
harem ladies or Latin Quarter art students.
The other day the girl in the fiat opposite
sallied forth to get an outfit for the Artists’
Ball. The costume-monger proposed a long
series of carnival disguises, every one of
which necessitated trousers—from a Polish
skater (all white cloth, baggy breeches and
fur-topped boots) to rompers. ' When the girl
had refused to go as a gondolier, a toreador,
a courtier (period unknown) or even a harem
lady, the costume-lender grew desperate.
“Well,” she said, making her last throw,
“here’s a perfectly sweet thing!” It was an
early-Victorian, with abbreviated skirts from
which descended pantalets.
Even the lass who has just emerged from
flapperdom is now netted in the ever-spread-
ing mesh of the charity money-raiser. A
group of girls set out to necromance for the
Free Kindergartens last week by means of
a ball at the Palais, and the result promises
to bring a smile to the treasurers, Olga Koch
and Esme Rodd. Olga was frocked in smart
black and silver, and Esme mingled rose du
barry and black georgette. Rosalynde Hardy-
Johnstone and Margaret Arthur, who had
worked hard as secretaries of the dance,
were other bright moments of the evening.
The big event was the shingle competition,
and the Dearborn prize was handed to Mar-
got Phillips’s sleek dark top-piece. Mrs.
Dundas Allen, who subjected the heads to as
critical a survey as a Dyak might in his
search for scalps, wore eye-arresting bro-
cades in gold and cherry tones finished off
with ethereal wing effects in cherry geor-
gettes. Monte Luke and artist D. H. Souter
awarded various prizes for rag dolls and
fancy costumes, and Mrs. Gore-Jones threw
the eye of a field-marshal over everything.
Walter Kirby sang like an archangel at
the cabaret for the Lewisham Hospital held
at the Wentworth last week, and tenor
Marques, of the Grand Opera Company, un-
leashed his dramatic warble over the tea-
drinking multitudes. Every inch of the ball-
room and the balcony was occupied, for the
ex-patient of Lewisham is its friend for life,
and the rally, whenever an SOS goes forth,
is almost overwhelming. Dr. Veech’s lady
was president of the function, and she and
her medical ally entertained a large party.
Good-looking Mrs. Mallam supplied the
accompaniments for the song-birds ; and among
the seething mass were Maoriland’s Parlia-
mentary librarian Wilson and his dark-
haired wife, who, by the way, are at Walla-
ringah Mansions during their Sydney visit.
Even as the flowers of Spring carpet the
ways of La Pcrouse, the Bishop bloomed on
every side at the fete in the Chapter House
last week: you couldn’t have trained a.
machine-gun on the gathering without crash-
ing at least one mitre. The fair was to raise
a soothing financial zephyr for St. Mar-
garet’s hostels for students. The State Gov-
ernor’s lady spoke the official Prologue over
a fragrant mass of .mauve, pink and crimson
sweet-pea, and afterwards the stalls did a
capital trade. The Attorney-General Bavin
couple were among the throng, with such
Chapter House enthusiasts as Mrs. Rabett,
Miss Macarthur Onslow, Marjorie Parr and
Mrs. Arthur Scriven.
It seemed as though half the city stepped
into the vestibule of Her Majesty’s to buy
a fairing of primrose or daffodil from little
Josie Melville the other day. The wealth
of gold had come from the Mountain
gardens of William Wark; and Tressillian,
the Mothercraft Home at Petersham, bene-
fited by the sale. Mrs. W. P. McElhone
was O.C. of the campaign, with Mrs. Milner
Stephen as first lieutenant.
What decorations survive the Artists’ Ball
are to be left adorning the basement of the
Town Hall for the children’s fancy-dress
party. This takes place on the afternoon
following the grown-ups’ revel, and is in aid
of the Red Cross V.A. Auxiliary. The
Grand March steps out at a quarter-past
three, and Gladys Owen will award the prizes
for the best fancy costume.
The gap caused in the R.S.P.C.A.’s Coun-
cil by the retirement of Mrs. L. Prince will
take some filling. A woman of imagination,
it was she who suggested the sale of “golden
bricks” at the Society’s annual meeting the
other day. These, with their dainty rib-
bons, went like hot cakes at fl each, and so
the R.S.P.C.A. new building has at least a
foundation. Another idea of hers was the
gold medal awarded by the society for
bravery. The fine, useful humanitarian was
one of the musical Fitz-Stubbscs.
It’s a queer thought that Dr. Grace
Boelke, who has always been a rebel with
regard to the tight-lacing of the conventions,
should earn a big slice of her daily bread in
a corset factory—even though she’s there as
medical adviser. Anyway, no kindlier or
more sympathetic soul ever saw to the wel-
fare of a busy hive of working girls, and it
was a rousing three cheers that greeted her
at the luncheon with which the Berlei direc-
tors welcomed the doctor home. The lady’s
wanderings have taken her over Europe and
the United States, and have been a pot-
pourri of professional activities and social
engagements. One party she found time to
look in at was the Garden Crush at Buck-
ingham Palace.
A Brisbane postcript:—-
As a wind-up to Show Week, Commodore Wardle
and the Fleet officers gave a party on the Platypus
and Brisbane. Sir Matthew Nathan was there with
Mrs. Pitt Rivers, Mrs. Turner, Miss Carleton, Capt.
Turner and H. M. Saunders, Mm. Pitt Rivers wearing
petunia and gold shot tissue, Miss Carleton prunella
silk lace with touches of turquoise, and Mrs. Turner
black silk cashmere. Gold lace decked Mrs. Espie
Bods; the Hawthorn, Byram, Cecil O’Beirne and
Ernest Baynes matrons were in black; Mrs. E. T.
Bell was in pink; Margaret Ross Munro in gold;
and Margaret Wilson in silver.
For the Bushman’s Dinner at Lennon’s, gum-trees
backgrounded the chairs and dining table; little
native bears sat aloft, a model of one of Cobb and
Co.’s old-time coaches was alongside a miniature
Western mail, and overhead flew an aeroplane to
represent the new air route from Charleville to
Cloncurry. Among the eaters were the Jack Chand-
lers, Leonard Browns, Colin Clarks, .Bulls and
Athertons, Mrs. G. C. Willcoeks, Dorothea Collins
and Vera Cotton.
Visiting hockey players had the cheerful cup
poured for them in the Gresham tea-room at the
instigation of the Uni. hockeyites. Red ranunculi
made gay the tables, and Miss Todd (the Queensland
captain) and Colonel Thynne’s lady held out the
hand of welcome to the carnival competitors.
Barbara Sisley staged a verse evening at the
Women’s Club, beginning with Shakspeare and ending
with Kipling. At the piano Jean Barlow suggested
high tide on the Lincolnshire coast according to
Liza Lehmann.
Marjorie Caine was bidden God-speed by Mrs. Roy
Purves at a lunch party at Lennon’s. Favors of
violets and kewpies and place cards in the shape of
travelling-bags were given to the guests, among
whom were the Barry, White and Asprey matrons,
Bebe Buleock and Edith Barry.
In honor of Edris Forth, bride-elect, Mrs. Ward
decorated her house with Iceland poppies, called in
a party, and handed little vanity cases to all the
guests.
The Lyceum Club opened its doors to members of
the inter-State hockey clubs, and spread a luncheon
for Misses Syme, Richards, Hodges and others from
the South. A motor trip up the Brisbane River was
also arranged for the visitors, after the second day’s
play.
Sir Matthew opened the Maryborough Show on the
20th; his brother George and Miss Pamela Nathan
went with him, and the Mayor welcomed the part} 7 .
His Ex. commented on the wonderful advance made by
the district’s dairying and banana industries, which
seemed to have arisen from the ashes of closed mines.
Queen-street pedestrians now see our first road-
side flower stall, the Country Women’s Assoc, having
fixed up a sight of beauty in gift gum-tips, Iceland
poppies and roses. These are being sold at sixpence
a bunch to help brighten the life of women and
children in the Backblocks.

The Williamstown people had no reason
to regret their enterprise in putting on a weight-for-
age mile at Saturday’s meeting. Easingwold was
reckoned the most forward of the 11 starters, and the
crowd followed the lead of the big punters associated
with Holt’s stable until O’Moses was demanding a
■shade of odds. But there was good money for Whit-
tier at 5 to 2 and 9 to 4, and a few pounds went
on King Carnival at 10’s. As at Moonee Valley, Eas-
ingwold got a rough passage and was never closer
than fourth, his position at the end. King Carnival
and Kidlaw saw to the pace, but at the distance
Whittier ran past them to win by two lengths from
the Comedy King four-year-old, who was a length
and a half ahead of the Derby colt Arendal, a very
promising bit of stuff, with Kidlaw fading into
seventh place. King Carnival’s good gallop earned
him friends for the Epsom, in which he has 9st.
31b., but the last 100 yards at Randwick has always
been a burden to him. A better Epsom trial was
that of Soorak (5 to 2) in the Seaside Handicap.
Under McCalman’s fostering care the brown son of
Woorak —So and So, now a five-year-old, has regained
the brilliancy that was sacrificed for a season or two
in the attempt to make a stayer of him. Though
badly placed in the early stages, he eventually made
smart sprinters like Jennawarra, C-helidon, All Serene
and Perspective look cheap. If Spurway’s flier was
entitled to 9st. in the Doncaster as a three-year-old
he must be considered well handicapped in the
Epsom with the same weight.
* * * ■»
On the form lie lias displayed recently
Collaroi will take a power of beating in the Epsom
Handicap with 7st. 41b. At, Rosehill on Saturday,
carrying Bst. 51b. in a mile handicap for three-
and four-year-olds, he was backed down to 5 to 2,
and, hitting the front in a few strides, came home
on the bit in the excellent time, for Rosehill, of
lmin. 401 see. Behind the greatly improved son of
Kenilworth —Regent Bird were Eric Connolly’s chest-
nut colt Rugbvean, a younger brother to All Sun-
shine; Shrapnel, who looked and finished pretty well;
Lady Valais, the highly--thought-of Hit (both solidly
backed) and other decent cattle. Collaroi is trained
at Randwick by the ex-Maoiilander Price, and seems
to be developing on the same lines as his relative
and stable-companion Stony. The latter, though far
from cherry-ripe, was supported for the Carlingford
Mile, in which he had 41b. more than his Metropoli-
tan weight (Bst. 91b.), and,, after meeting with inter-
ference, was beaten home only by the dead-heaters,
Prince Woorak (9 to 4) and The Wild Goose (B’s),
and the handsome Valais chestnut Valiant, who is
still generously fleshed. In view of his
great second in the Sydney Cup (he had been
successful in the Tocal Handicap two days before),
Stony has a distinct Metropolitan chance. Dion
(9 to 4), a hitherto disappointing bay colt by Demos-
thenes —Linaeese, was much too good for the animals he
met in the Maiden Handicap, but engendered doubts
as to his liking for the business by swerving out
near the finish; and Dreblah (B’s) evoked roars
from a section of the grandstand crowd, by outstaying
Hermealdo and the heavily-backed Irish Rhythm—
a handsome but very unruly customer —-in the 11-
furlongs Rosehill Handicap. He had failed at 10
furlongs on the previous Saturday, his “pony”
jockey having taken all the steam out of him by
chasing Nygee; on this occasion, with less stable
money on him, he w r as ridden a nice waiting race
by Munro. Mirthmaker, who has grown into a fine
horse, made most of the running and split third
money with Irish Rhythm. Mont Clair (20’s) put Mc-
Shortodds well ahead of it by coming with an irresis-
tible run at the right end of the Highweight Handi-
cap, for which All Gold was a 2-to-l favorite in a
field of 23. The tubed Mountain King chestnut
had been giving his trainer a lot of trouble, and
there wasn’t a shilling for him 5.0., while he
returned £l3 17s. 6d. for 10s. on the three-divs.
tote.
Old David ran another fair race in the Rosehill
Handicap. In the autumn he was a jaded and
melancholy animal manifestly yearning for the pad-
dock, but he looks bright enough now. The racing at
Randwick on September 6 will probably throw some
light on the Epsom and Metropolitan. At present
Collaroi is this page’s choice for the mile handicap,
and Highlander, whose preparation is going on nicely,
for the 13-furlongs affair.

“Mason”: She was rather a striking
woman, with coal-black eyes and hair, and more
fashionably dressed than most of the fashionable
crowd on'the lawn for this Hunt Club meeting at
Moonee Valley. Clinging to her hand was a black-
eyed kid of six or eight years. It; was that hushed
and electric moment when the horses have just
come into line for the walk-up to the barrier. Even
the steady roar of the ring had fallen away to an
occasional unheeded shout of “Two to one the field.
Suddenly the silence was broken by a voice that
cried in a childish but quite colorable imitation of
the professional manner; “Six to four the field:
Six to four the field!” There was a splutter of
laughter al I around, and I saw that the voice belonged
to the modishlv gowned woman’s young hopeful. As
I looked back at them, I heard a friend greet her
with, “How d’ you do, Mrs. Cohenstein?” And
still, I believe, there are people who question such
things as hereditary influence and instinct 1

Westrulinn goldfields racing is not what
it used to be in the days of Le \ar and Paul Pry,
or oven in those of Lilyveil and Mistico, but the
Hannans Handicap—Kalgoorlie Cup meeting still
attracts a sizable crowd. The ancient Ticli, who
won a race at Randwick when the Prince of Wales
was punting there, annexed the Handicap this year,
and the Cup went to Tranquil, a 10-to-l shot. War-
path, an importation from Maoriland, was the Cup
favorite on the strength of a weight-foi'-age success
on the first day of the meeting, but he let the
multitude down.

Brisbane critics have a good opinion of
Serelot, who won the Tattersall’s Cup at Eagle Farm
for O. C. McGrowdie. His mother, Lotchen, was
a useful mare in her day, and, mated with Shepherd
King, she threw Ivingslot, who was shaping like a
Metropolitan horse until he went wrong last year.
Serelot is the result of her union with Seremond.
There is talk of bringing him south for the A.J.O.
Derby, but the local classic will be a lot easier.

Pity Fleetstone and Haoina were not
spelled after their heroic tussle in the V.R.C. Grand
National. Fleetstone failed badly in the Australian
Steeplechase at Caulfield, and the little horse got a
cruel spill in the A.R.C. National. Favorite as usual,
he hit the second fence hard, and at the fourth he
toppled over. The race was easy for Silver Heart
(Challenger-—Pianola), who had chased Rahda and
Lord Saxon home in the Grand National Hurdle;
and Lord Saxon, whose second had been worth £7 ss.
to purchasers of £1 tickets, was third. Cattleman

Adelaide Racing Club lias had to make a
big change in the conditions of the Fulham Park
Plate, its important start-of-the-season event for
two-year-olds. Entries have grown to an
number for the track; and, rather than divide a
classic, the A.R.C. has shut the fillies out of it.
They still have the Dequettville Stakes to themselves.

Port Adelaide Racing Club, at its annual
meeting, claimed credit for a lot of things, in
particular a promised Cup race worth £3OOO, the

JIM BARDEN,
Randwick trainer.

Dr. Benson, the chair-
man. was lately elected
on the committee of
S.A. Jockey Club. He
pointedly resented a
proposal to exclude
from that body officials
of other clubs, “but,”
he added, “if the
S.A.J.C. w 7 ill appoint
a board of appeal, or
a consultative commit-
tee, of delegates from
each of the clubs, I
will gladly resign from
its committee and con-
sider achieved the
object which prompted
me in standing for it.”
Queensland owns some fine sprinters in
L. C. Parker, Norman Grehan, Goldsworthy and
Scouller. Parker ran magnificently in the State
A.A.A. championships at Brisbane, winning the 100
yards in even time, the 220 in 21 2-ssec. (two
timekeepers made it that) and the 440 in 52sec. His
time for the furlong was a tenth of a second better
than E. W. Carr's Australian record, established at
Adelaide in 1922, but owing to the absence of a
third timekeeper the authorities won’t recognise it.
It is a pity Parker wasn’t sent to Paris as reserve
sprinter, instead of one of the middle-distance men,
who never had a hope against the Finns and the
Yanks, Ma State athletes brought back some of
the Queensland titles. R. S. Caldwell (Botany) won
the half-mile in 2min. 8 2-ssec. ; L. Fitzhenry the
mile in 4min. 42 4-ssec.; and James Hatton the
three miles in 15min. 9 l-ssec., a State record.
Carr, by the way, has been revisiting Germany for
v 7 hat are described as “the greatest international
athletic contests held at Berlin since the war.” In
the 100 metres, run in 10 3-ssec., he finished a
yard behind Houben, his opponent of last year, with
Porritt, the Maoriland Rhodes Scholar, third. The
cableman drily records that the German beat the gun
by a metre (39.37 inches), but was not recalled.
However, the Sydney youth licked the Germans
Kruger and Rappard in the 200 metres, which he
won in 21 4-ssec. Judging by his form at Dublin
and Paris he should have been at least second to
Abrahams in the 100 metres at Paris and third to
Scholz in the 200 metres, but unfortunately he was
not at his best at the Olympic sprints, and he is
unlikely to remain in the game till the Amsterdam
affair comes round.

Australia’s Davis Cup prospects have been
dimmed a bit by the failure of Patterson and O’Hara
Wood in the U.S. Rational Doubles at Bahst’n. The
pair made a great attempt to pluck the honors for
their Commonwealth, beating Williams and Wash-
burn 6 —o in the last of five sets, and overcoming
Wallace Johnston and Griffin after the latter had cap-
tured two sets and it was five-all in the third. Hut
in the final the Australians were defeated by the
Kinsey brothers from California, whom they had
vanquished earlier in the season. On a court made
slow by rain Wood was unwontedly unsteady and
inaccurate, and Patterson was bothered by the tricky
lobs of Howard Kinsey, a mercurial youth who plays
in horn-rimmed spectacles ; but it was a near thing.
The Australians were 5 —4 in the first set, and were
within a point of winning it on three occasions;
but Howard Kinsey’s fine play at the crisis enabled
the Californians to gain the next three games, which
practically decided the issue. For Australia won
the second and third sets (7 —5, 9—7), California
taking the fourth and fifth (0 —3, 6—4). Before
meeting Patterson and his partner the Kinseys had
overwhelmed Snodgrass and Westbrook (6 —2, 6—o,
6 2), the latter having eliminated Lacoste and
Borotra in a five-set. match. If Lacoste and the
Basque are the Gallic pair in the Davis Cup doubles
the Australians will have little to fear.

An Australian team which included J. O.
Anderson, Peach and the industrious left-hander Fit-
chett, whose play is steadily improving, put Com-
bined Universities through at Rushcutter’s Bay.
Anderson was the principal factor in the victory, but
he had to go all he knew to beat Hone (4 —-6,
7 5, 12—10). The South Australian will be in the
next Davis Cup team if he doesn’t take care, and if
Anderson and Patterson are in it also, it will be worth
looking at for more reasons than one. They are
giants all three.

Tommy Uren (list. 11 lb.) surprised a
small Sydney Stadium crowd by regaining the middle-
weight championship from the 411 b. heavier Merv.
Williams. In the early rounds Williams looked a
sure winner, but Uren caught him off his balance
in the sixth round with a straight left, and after
that the veteran always had a bit the better of xhe
going. Williams overdid the clinging business,
probably because he had taken off a good bit of
weight and wasn’t sure of himself. He would
be well advised to build up to 12st. and fight the
heavy brigade.

The vast crowds that stayed away from
Saturday’s clash at Melbourne Stadium missed nothing
much. Harry Whybrow, the English lightweight,
proved no match for Billy Grime. He stalled brightly
enough, but the inaccessibility of the elusive pug
from the Riverina soon disconcerted him, and the
loud-toned advice of his seconds was unavailing. The
battle was all Grime’s, and the youth from overseas,
whose chief contribution to the controversy was a
straight left with no power behind it, was a very
tired Briton in the fifteenth round. He lasted the
full hour, but was too exhausted even to assume the
customary expression of intense agony of mind when
the referee gave it to Grime.

It would seem that the personnel of the
coming English cricket team, as cabled two or three
weeks ago, wasn’t absolutely official. Mcßryan, the
Somerset amateur and one of the most reliable of
scorers, hasn’t been picked ; it is explained that he
was merely sounded. And Gibson, owing to business
in the Argentine or somewhere, cannot come. On
the other hand, Hobbs, who stipulated that his wife’s
exes, should be paid as well as his own, is to be
included, leaving it to be inferred that he carried
his point. And the recognition of the necessity for
having one genuine fast bowler has made a place in
the team for Howell, of Warwickshire. Howell got
wickets in Australia four years ago, but at a huge
cost in runs; it is claimed for him that he had
cruel luck in his slip fieldsmen and that he may
look to be better supported this time. Finally,
Whysall (Notts) comes as Strudwick’s understudy
behind the sticks. He must have been almost worth
a place on his recent batting performances, for he
was the first county player this year to reach his
1000 runs, and his tally included four centuries in
successive matches. Whysall must be a late-blooming
cricketer, for he is 36 years old and, according
to a London paper, was never within distance of re-
presenting the Players against the Gents, till this
season. As a second-string wicketkeeper he hasn’t
much chance of showing his batting quality in the
Tests, with the tough and tireless Strudwick blocking
the way.

Tom Kendall, dead in Tasmania, shared
with Bonnor and Alick Bannerman the experience
of playing in a Test match before he had represented
his State (Vic.). Picked for the first match against the
Englishmen in 1877, he bagged one for 54 in the
first innings and seven for 55 in the second. Aus-
tralia won that event, mainly owing to Charlie
Bannerman’s unfinished 165. In the second Test
Kendall got four for 82 and two for 24. He toured
in Australia with the first XI of 1878, but was not
taken to England.

S.A. lacrosseurs are in mourning. Theirs is
the one game in which the State has hitherto more
than held its own, and this year’s form was thought
to be high, especially since an unusual goal-thrower
was found in Gordon, of the University. There was
a rude awakening when a Victorian team went across
and scored 16 to 2. Immediately after, Melbourne
University won by 6 to 3 against the local under-
grads; the aforesaid Gordon got all the goals for
the losers. In the State match, Beattie, the Victorian
captain, threw 5 goals, and Stedman 7 • but possiblv

morrow ?
The fortnight’s spell from League games did
some of the Vic. teams good ; others it didn’t. Thu*
Carlton, who are not in “the four,” played so
lackadaisically against South Melbourne that at half’
time they hadn’t scored one point, while South
owned 43. After that the indecency of the thing
and the jeers of the barrackers woke up the Old
Blues, and they finished with 31 points to South's
97 —which was horrible enough. Similarly, Fitzroy
utterly smashed St. Kilda with a tally of 109 points
to 46. Moriarty kicked 8 goals and brought his
season's aggregate up to 64 —2 less than Stockdale's
total. The Richmond Tigers kept their place and
improved their percentage of points by collecting 121
against Melbourne's 74. Down at Geelong a record
crowd paid £346 in hopes of seeing Collingwood
walloped, and, after a dismal period, went home rejoic-
ing. The contestants were level, with Richmond, for
fourth place. Geelong toiled in the rear for the greater
part of the game, but 10 minutes before the end
there was nothing between them. After that ’Wood
went to pieces, and Geelong made tracks for the
dressing-room, tired but triumphant, with 73 points
to the Magpies’ 36.
“P. Pawnticket”: Many Melbourne football bar-
raekers take themselves very seriously, and none more
so than a middle-aged supporter of a team which
went under in its previous engagement. but w T on last
Saturday. He split the welkin (whatever that may
be) with his roaring encouragement of the players
he favored, and his leather-lunged voice was so
much a feature of the afternoon’s sport that, at its
conclusion, the crowd around him jestingly con-
gratulated him on winning the match. He modestly
admitted that his loud cheers may have helped, and
pointed out that the voice of the enthusiast was
often a deciding factor in an encounter. It was
just here that a heavy fist landed squashily on his
nose. “Well, why the ’ell wasn’t cha here a week
ago?” demanded the owner of the fist.
“Tren”: Mark Tandy is not the only Melbourne
footballer who bogs in most effectively when his
socks are down (B. 7/8/’24). Alec Eason, of Foots-
cray, who is even further advanced into the sere
and yellow leaf than “Napper,” but is his only peer
as a rover, fathered the idea. If Alec’s socks don’t
fall early in the game, he will pause long enough to
tear them down. He says it makes him feel “des-
perit.” Tandy, by the way, is in trouble. His
team, Stoush Melbourne, lately collided with their
nearest neighbors and bitterest enemies, St. Kilda.
During hostilities “Napper’s” elbow inflicted a com-
pound fracture on the cheek-bone of Saints’ captain,
Eicke, and although the umpire gave his verdict of
“accident” St. Kilda is athirst for “Napper’s” gore.
* * * *
“Machete”: West Wallsend, many times
winners of the Gardiner Cup, which carries with if
the State Soccer championship, are probably the best
and soundest soccer club in Australia. In the
Newcastle senior competition, “Westies” defeated May-
field by 25 goals to 1, which is probably an Aus-
tralian record —there is an_ English record, put up
in some minor fixture, which stands 43 —0. West
Wallsend play a strenuous, rushing game, and fairly
ran over the unfortunate opposition, whose onb
score came as the result of an error by Wallsend s
goalie.

“Past Grammar”: In December next
Rugby Union representatives of England, France,
Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Australia and Maonlanu
will meet in London. Out of the conference, it is
expected, will issue an international Board, con-
sisting of one representative from each country, to
control the game and its laws, as well as the
settlement of disputes. Other important matters will
be the inauguration of regular international tours,
and also a definite law as regards professionalism.
The case of Lawton, the Queenslander, has brought
matters to a head, and in future, unless a man can
show that he has never received cash or kind lor
playing footer, he will have little chance of re-
instatement as an amateur. The “allowance ques-
tion is to be settled too, ss. per day being the pro-
posed maximum. Many alterations to the rules
are proposed, including one abolishing the kick-out
from the 25 and substituting a scrum. Anyone
remembering the continual scrum for every s .
of penalty, which has so sickened People of the
League game in Sydney, will say No to that. Th
variety of the line-out catne as an absolute refreshe
to many a League addict who went to see the All
Blacks this season.
AN ACQUIRED TASTE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“J. W. Hearne, the Middlesex cricketer, says that
after the cathedral-like calm of English grounds, the
funny, good-natured and impartial badinage of Aus-
tralian barrackers is positively refreshing.”
At Lords, no doubt, or Scarborough, or Brighton,
Tradition calls for amiable restraint.
No yells from turbulent spectators frighten
The batsman who is nervy, or acquaint
Slow fields with their deficiencies, or lighten
Dull spells of play with voluble complaint.
A man may even “sit upon the splice”
And not invite ironical advice.
But at the Oval, where in myriads muster
Surrey’s indomitable partisans,
fir Sheffield, where the blades insistent cluster,
Or Trafford, dear to the Lancastrian fans,
Accompaniments rise from lungs robuster,
More liberal of blessings and of bans.
Surely no charge of “calm, cathedral-like”
Was ever laid against the Yorkshire tyke!
Rejoice withal, ye barrackers sonorous
Who make your coign of vantage on the Hill
And function like a Greek dramatic chorus,
Albeit more stentorian and shrill,
Your pertinacity may sometimes bore us,
Your humor often be elusive. Still,
E’en when opponents are being lined a treat,
Poison to one may be another’s meat.
The tributes to proficiency you render
Or its reverse, satirical or sage,
Beyond endurance may provoke a Fender
Or fill a Wilson with consuming rage ;
It only shows their skins are ultra-tender
To feel a sting in gentle badinage.
A trifle irked with English unconcern,
It merely marks a pleasant change for Hearne.

THE INKY WAY.
“Nick”: The Cocky members practise preference
to their own press. When Works Minister Stewart
resigned from, the Federal Government, the full state-
ment of his reasons was given exclusively to the
Countryman, and so was Dr. Page’s reply. The
dailies were reduced to the necessity of reprinting
(with due'acknowledgment) from their humble rival.
“Lei”: W. E. Trautmann, who loomed large in
the early history of the I.W.W. in America, and
whose writings used to have a big circulation in
the Commonwealth, is no longer connected with the
I-Won’t-Works, but when last heard of was toiling
in a Chicago lamp-glass factory. By birth he is
a Maorilander, a native of Grahamstown, in the
Thames Valley.
“Stellsby”: Selecting a spot handy to a vacant
slab in the San Francisco morgue, Pete Clark Mac-
farlane, novelist, short-story writer and sometime
Saturday Evening Post representative in turbulent
Ireland, drew a pistol and finished matters after a
stiff fight with diabetes. His farewell message ran:
“I have been broken on the wheel of the Soul’s effort
to express itself. Nothing remains but to dynamite
the ruins.”
“Pic’’: Dr. Earle Page’s Budget includes one
item with an unfamiliar sound, “Cost of compila-
tion of the Official Historv of Australia’s part in
the war,” £4OOO. A similar sum is set apart for
the same object for next year. C. E. W. Bean and
a staff of assistants have been engaged on this job
for some years now, but this is the first occasion
that the public has been allowed to know what their
very necessary work is costing.
“F.L.H.” : An old Inky-wayfarer, Richard Ransom
Skeeles, has died in Melbourne, aged 81. The
present generation would not know him —it is 20 years
since he left off being superintendent at the Govern-
ment Printing Office. He came to Melbourne 70
years ago and worked first for the Herald. Later
he went into the country and helped the Bacchus
Marsh Express ; and finally he joined the Govern-
ment Printer’s ranks. In his later days he was a
profound student of theosophy and such like.
“Inkpot”: A cheerful little magazine that looks
as if it had come to stay is run by Fred Davison
from a small office up above W. C. Wentworth’s old
home at Vaucluse (Sydney). Under the compre-
hensive title of Australia it features the long short-
story, and says unpleasant things on principle about
Government jobs and the Government stroke. Unlike
many shortlived inkslingers’ monthlies, Australia
started with cheap paper and none of the extrava-
gances that have inflicted early decay upon other
ventures of the sort.
“Adamascus”: Capt. Fred Rhodes, sec. of the Cot-
ton Growers’ Union, who runs the Cotton Farmer,
of Rockhampton, and was mainly responsible for the
Q. Government lifting the ban on ratoon cotton,
used to be a mariner, chased submarines in the Medi-
terranean during the war, and on his return was
harbor-master at Rockhampton. He made himself
unpopular with the Government by criticism in tne
newspapers, whereon he received notice of transfer to
Thursday Island. He refused to go, and lost Ins .job.
It was largely through Rhodes’s efforts that the
pilot station at Willis Island was established.
“Max”; After 15 years of reviewing for Melbourne
Herald, Professor Archie Strong has dropped R-
His work as critic and reviewer had become almost
an institution. Fifteen years ago he was n track-
blazer in the popularisation of poetry, especially tne
established and imported article. I remember tn
thrill some of us felt when Strong started wntnv
his special articles for the Herald, and how became
of their appearance cn Tuesdays the paper attracte
to it a. band of readers to whom literary subjects
were the breath of life. Poet Bernard O Down spo
of the departure as marking a fundamental change
Life towards Letters.
“Coot”: The Ballarat Star, recently purchased by
its younger rival, the Ballarat Courier, was foun
in 1855; for the first few yearn, however, it wn
known as the Ballarat Times. The Courier cam-,
into existence in 1865. H. R. Nicholls, subsequent
editor of the Hobart Mercury and father ot unei
Justice Herbert Nicholls, followed Seekamp ln l ,
chair (Seekamp was the early-day man whom m>-
Montez horsewhipped in Sturt-street). The manag 4
editor for many years was T. D. Wanliss, M-L- ~
who died, aged 92, in Scotland a, few months ag •
Chief Justice Irvine is his son-in-law. The eo
of the Star at the date of its decease was t. h
Smith, son of the late James Smith, a pipmmem

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“If the man were to cut his prefaces he might be

ages to display his ignorance of the subjects under
discussion. —uydney critic on Mum s Saint Joan.”
1 see him at his writing-pad,
Or typing rapidly and well;
A bright if somewhat spotty lad,
Noisy—and empty—as a bell;
Full to the teeth of confidence,
Though short of culture and of brain;
Plenty of zest, though little sense—
Ah, would that I were young again!
There was a time when Milton seemed
A mediocrity to me;
When eyes intolerantly gleamed
If Dickens was alleged to be,
And Burns and Byron, first-late men;
My friends and I contempt would rain
On Meredith and Hardy then.
Ah, would that I were young again!
Not that we lacked the God-sent gift
Of being able to admire.
Pieans of praise our tongues would lift
That any genius’ desire
Might satisfy. But from their shelves
The famous looked for fame in vain;
Our only cheers were for ourselves.
Ah, would that I were young again!
Those were the days when Gus MeWeerd
(1 hear his thund’rous verses still)
A greater dramatist appeared
Than Stratford’s over-boosted Will;
When Beegle’s song was sweeter far
Than Percy Shelley’s puling strain,
And Binks was an artistic star—
Ah, would that I were young again!
Envoy.
Onlv in youth does angry scorn
With joyous faith walk hand in hand;
Only by youth is greatness torn,
Protesting, from its hard-won stand,
And flogged like some offending hound ;
Then, bellowing with fear and pain,
Flung with contumely to the ground.
Ah, would that I were young again!

HUDSON
Adds a New Advantage
of Price and Quality
The great number of Super-Sixes
you see in service expresses the
outstanding position Hudson holds
as a value.
For more than nine years it has
outsold all fine cars.
And today it holds an even more
impressive price and quality advan-
tage. More beautiful lines and the
finest Super-Six chassis ever built,
make it the greatest Hudson value of
all time. You will find that holds
good, whether you select the closed
car luxury of the Sedan or the Coach,
or the airiness and freedom of the
Phaeton or the Speedster.
Retaining all the old qualities for
which Hudson is famous the new
chassis gives greater economy in fuel,
oil and maintenance, and added
smoothness in operation. Another
important economy is the low cost
of all replacement parts.
Built by the Hudson Motor Car Co.,
—the sixth largest builder of cars in
the world —the quality and perma-
nence of the car are assured by a
policy of 14 years’ development.—

“The Rise of Rosie O’Reilly,” given a
welcome at the New Princess’s (Melbourne)
by a crowded house, started with a whirl
that promised well; but later the pauses
(breathless, no doubt) became a trifle obvi-
ous. Rosie rose in two acts, divided into
three scenes each (a fourth in Act 1 is
merely a transformation) ; and each one of
the four full sets is a good stage-picture—
Hugh Ward is out of friends with the
gospel of cheapness which has lately had so
much faithful following on the Australian
stage.
* * * •
Rosie is a sister of Sally; the sweet
female bud discovered amongst crooks and
bootleggers and given a rise to affluence
through the love of a scion of the idle rich
is a property likely to be used in musical
comedy until the public grows sick of it.
Rosie sells papers and sings sweetly to the
proletariat (and, incidentally, visiting shim-
mers) at the Brooklyn end of the bridge that
connects N’York with its great suburb, and
she gets her rise because she awakens the
love of Bob Morgan, who proclaims it in
a loud voice from the neighborhood of a
paper-stall which is more often unattended
than not. She is promptly adopted (with
her brother and chief friends) by Morgan’s
wealthy relatives, and the subsequent happi-
ness is only held in abeyance by the machina-
tions of certain bad people who want black-
mail, and by the opposition of a hard-hearted
parent who rather naturally objects to his
“EAST OF SUEZ ,” AT MELBOURNE
KING’S.
Henry Anderson (Maurice Tuohy) essays to
Icicle out the Chinese slavey (Eily Mal-
yon), and is informed by his wife Daisy
(Muriel Starr ) that she is her mother.
son bestowing his millions on a daughter of
the slums, but is perfectly satisfied when
he discovers that Dorothy Brunton is the
lady. Anyhow, the interruptions are quite
providential; how otherwise could we have
a chance to see and listen to some good
dances, fair melodies, a rippling chorus or
two and the patter which mostly passes for
dialogue?
• * * *
Many of the songs are plays on old melo-
dies which have been nearly forgotten ; but
generally the musical numbers are bright,
if trivial, and the opening of Scene 3 of
Act I is a distinguished bit of chorus work.
With the McLeans and Eddie Bussell in
the cast the specialty dances are naturally
good, and Russell’s “Dance Grotesque” in
Act II and the McLeans’ “Whirlwind Dance”
in Scene 3 (same act) are better. The
weakness of the production is in the' dia-
logue, which holds up a frivolity that other-
wise would whirl most effectively. And
there is a weakness, too, outside the chorus
in the women’s voices—a fault now fairly
general. Dorothy Brunton made a Bosie
winsome enough to explain a young million-
aire’s sudden infatuation; and Charles lies-
lop, as Morgan’s English pal, Jimmy \vhit-
ney, drifted easily along with the burden 01-
most of the patter. Les Pearce’s appearance
as Bob Morgan was all right, but his singing
lacked inspiration; John Kirby’s figure
helped him to display his “emotional suits
as a plain-clothes detective, and he was
otherwise adequate as the man who drags
in the plot; and a big company of satisfy-
ing people worked well with voices and feet
to make the play a great first-night success
—such a success that from a stage laden
with floral offerings John Fuller, on behalf
of the management, two-thirds of which is
away in London, was able to make grateful
remarks.
Winnie Collins, who succeeds Madge
Elliott, had her Melbourne introduction in a
revival of “A Night Out,” that pleasing idiocy
which has so many reminders of “The Mag-
istrate” and the musical comedy made out of
it, “The Boy.” Winnie owns a captivating
smile, a nice figure, and an ability to do all
the dancing and singing required in the part
of Marcelle; one could be very easily envious
of Frith, who has a chance to have a niglxt-
out with her. But Winnie gives the impres-
sion of a somewhat languid lady, who will
need a great deal more vim to leap into the
hearts of the Australian public as some
locally-bred stars have done. “Life” is the
quality most in demand by Australian audi-
ences.
sfc sj: sfc
Melbourne King’s Theatre continues to be
a patch of the Orient in which Muriel Starr
goes on her wrong-headed way amidst the pic-
turesque surroundings of “East of Suez.”
The atmosphere seems to appeal to Melbourn-
ites, and numerous people who have eaten
chop-suey are prepared to swear affidavits
that the Chinese fixings are very real. The
audiences have provided a rather quaint com-
mentary upon the gospel according to St.
Thespis, that “East is East and West is
West, and never the twain may meet”—
many prosperous Melbourne Celestials,
accompanied by white wives, have viewed the
show with complacency.

The Wilkie co. stumbled in its stride at
its last matinee, when “As You Like It” had
to be substituted for “Henry V.” The change
was advantageous. To make an endurance
test of Shakspeare is not wise; and the co.
would foster the taste for his works by re-
peating those in which it is capable of giv-
ing good performances rather than by adding
to its repertoire those in which it cannot —
in its present circumstances. There are plays
which might be dropped or recast for other
reasons. Miss Hunter-Watts is pleasing in
many parts, but “Macbeth” needs a Lady
Mac. which she cannot supply. She neither
looks nor represents the ambitious woman
who is responsible for Macbeth’s blood-guilt;
and she fails in similar parts. One of the
winners during the present season was
“Julius Caesar,” to which many school-
children were shepherded with an eye to
class-work. “The Merchant” was repeated,
and is billed again for this (Thursday)
afternoon; the always-popular “Twelfth
Night” is for revival to-night, “Much Ado
About Nothing” follows on Friday, and
“Othello” is the Saturday bill. Next week
there will be repetitions of some of the co.’s
successes.

Amongst the soloists at the Philharmonic'
Society’s performance of “The Flying
Dutchman,” at the Melbourne Town
Hall last w r eek. the most distinguished
work was that of S. Laslett-Exton.
He represented Erik the Huntsman
with sympathy and a good perception of his
dramatic relation to the whole. Mrs. Goos-
sens-Viceroy was splendidly detached, as if
she would sing what she had to sing though
there "was no one else in the world to sing
with her. The ballad in Act 2 w T as well
done, but she failed where a big dramatic
effoi’t was required in Act 3. Leslie Mac-
Callum delivered the goods as Van der
Decken in good, even voice, which gave just
that impression—that he was delivering
goods. Of the chorus, the opening of Act
2 (the Spinning Chorus) was excellently
delivered by the feminine section, but the
males were faulty and unequal; and- the
orchestra would have earned its applause
had its work kept tip to the sample presented
in the overture. The performance produced
nothing to put enthusiasm into the polite
applause usually provided on these occasions.
A greater freedom in his always artistic
work marked the second and later concerts
of Micky Munz at Melbourne Town Hall;
especially in his Brahms numbers he shook
off much of that restraint which character-
ised his first appearance. There was bril-
liancy and vigor in the F Minor Sonata of
that master, with a reverential treatment of
some of the sentimental passages. Chopnfis
24 preludes brought the wizard back to his
former mood, personally unassertive but
artistically excellent, the brilliancy of the
G Major prelude especially stirring the audi-
ence.
The only change iu Melbourne Tivoli
programme is the addition of one Hymack,
who. in “The Mannequin's Dream,” does an
old trick act, budding with unexpected ties,
spare shirts and -buttonholes, and losing his
clothes unaccountably—certainly no _ better
than it has been done before. And considering
that there are smart verse-writers in Austra-

lia capable of turning out better stuff at
sixpence a line, tlie monotonous rhymed coup-
lets with which he leads up to his tricks are
almost criminal. However, the programme
still contains Whelan, not to mention Du
Caliou and some others, so it can stand a
few duds.

Melbourne may not be over-generous in
some ways, but it hands around colds freely,
and Irene Franklin, getting one of them, was
off the Royal bill for several days. Bright
as the lady is, the show was able to sustain
the loss. This week changes come with the
arrival of Walter Weems, Hetty King and
others.

A paint-sliow down south: —
Delightful freshness is the prevailing note in the
Melbourne Athenaeum Gallery’s show of John Rowell’s
art. He takes ordinary fragments of landscape,
sometimes including a bit of a shed which a self-
respecting council might condemn as unsightly, and
shows how it should be seen with an artist’s eyes.
Rowell uses the device of taking his scene against
the light to score some very delicate effects. A
good example is No. 55, showing an open stretch
of country in a grey haze. “Rain Mists” (No. 39)
is a well-treated subject with half-obscured sun-
light on the waters and a drizzling mist sweeping
over a bold shore-line. Some of the smaller pictures,
little cameos, are the most delightful of the collec-
tion ; but the flower studies are only in the cate-
gory of colored photographs.
Grand Opera in Sydney will soon be an
echo. Less than a dozen more nights remain
for Sydney’s ear to be ravished by Paolan-
tonio’s orchestra and more or less enthralled
by the various songbirds. Dame Nellie is
billed to make her farewell appearance as
little Maggie Faust on Sept. 4. All of her
more recently-announced appearances have
been forbidden ; but she says that on this last
occasion she positively tvill.

Zacharewitseh-Cellini-Cimara continue to
lure the musically hungry to Sydney Town
Hall. On Saturday night a packed audience
was given a chance to compare the luscious
tone produced by the violinist in the Bruch
Concerto with the thistledown lightness of
the Moffatt number. Cellini's big thing was
the Prize Song from “The Master-singers.”
He took this at a slower pace than most
others, with a consequent deepening of tone.
Cimara, at the piano, provided some happy
moments. The trio will be heard again to-
night (Thursday) and on Saturday.
“Kempy” keeps John O’Hara in the warm
glow of public approbation at Sydney Cri.
The show is in its sixth week and the last
nights draw near.
At Sydney Opera House “Little Nellie
Kelly” is taking the tide of popular approval
at the flood; it depends upon the sex of the
individual whether the frocks or the forms
which they conceal (or indicate) compel the
more admiration. But both are undoubtedly
a credit to the producers as well as the
graceful beings who inhabit the clothing, and
the dancing is above the average.
At Sydney Royal “Good Morning. Dearie!”
continues to display an exceptionally choice
assortment of Girl, with Josie Melville in
the lead.
At Sydney Palace Mount Everest is still
being climbed nightly, and some afternoons
as well, under the guidance of Colonel Pot-
tin ger.
At Sydney Tivoli Bransby Williams is
presenting a more youthful and dapper
Micawber than The Bulletin’s cheques
feature; also a Uriah Heep whose sandy
hair detracts a trifle from his sliminess, and
a Serjeant Buzfuz who seems to have more
than a suspicion that he is a comic creation.
Victoria Carmen, an English panto artist,
and a tiny girl who acts as her shadow put
in a pleasant dancing turn; and the instru-
mental and comic effects of Anna and Louis,
the eccentric musicians, fill the house with
glee. Among the others there is nothing
better than Kiddy King, the boy _ juggler;
the youngster catches all sorts of articles with
such wonderful adroitness that the Cricket
Council might do worse than hire him to
field in “the gully” in Test matches.

Henry Lawson’s “Joe Wilson and His
Mates” is the foundation upon which Joe
Beaumont Smith’s latest picture and Ins
best to date —is built. A faithful reflection
of the spirit of the pioneers who battle m
the open spaces, with a broad vein of humor
running through it, “Joe” should draw every
good picture-going Australian to the Lyceum
or Lyric this week. Arthur Tauchert and
Gordon Collingridge have big roles. In addi-
tion at the Lyric the “Harmony Bushmen
are singing songs that have been sung around
the camp-fires for 50 years or more. Hoyt’s
tell “Why Men Leave Home,” the reason
in this case being a lady who fiddles with the
keys of a typewriter. Also on view is “40-
Horse Hawkins,” who violates the “one man
one job” principle by occupying eight different
billets in the course of his appearance. Across
the Globe’s screen “The Shadows of Paris”
flit, and Pola Negri finds it doesn’t pay to be
an Apache heroine and a police-chief’s wife
at the same time.

A quite unusual inactivity in drama in
Adelaide is being tempered by the start of
a Seymour Hicks campaign. The Royal
still plods along with a mixed bill. Bransby
Williams, in making his farewell there, spoke
mournfully of poor public support; the simple
fact is that the old-fashioned people avlio
are the strongest for Dickens are precisely
those who don’t go to variety shows. In an-
other mixed bill, at the Majestic, Con Moreni
is the particular star, but the team work of
the chorus is strong. In pictures, the York
has “Flaming Youth,” in which there is now
Hot a shadow of offence left. On the same
bill is a delightful “Galloping Fish,” a seal
equally at home in the water or in a taxi,
with a flood that brings in a lot of other
escaped beasts.
From an Adelaide critic: —
The show of paintings got up for Artists’ Week
in Adelaide brought 20,000 visitors, and sold £l7OO
worth of pictures. The management was in the hands
of the Preeces, father and son. The small gallery
over their bookshop (accommodated the Norman
Lindsay "annexe.” Banned by one authority and
blessed by another, the “annexe” was visited by
some 30,000 people. It was not all curiosity
either, for sales of etchings totalled £6O0 —and
nearly all the best work shown was not for sale.
MELBOURNE PALACE—ALLAN
WILKIE SHAKSPEAREAN SEASON.
“AS YOU LIKE IT.”
Orlando (Leslie Manners) proceeds to wrecl
the reputation of Charles, the Duke's
wrestler (Milton Sands).
Coleman Phillipson, the Law professor of the Uni-
versity, was the most eloquent voice in opposition.
He thus had the unusual experience, when he gave
a lecture on “Art and Life” afterwards, which was
guessed to be intended as a scalping of Norman
Lindsay, of finding his hall packed to the doors
and uncounted numbers turned away.

“R.Iv.D.N.”: In his memorable last-night
speech in Australia Asche promised to return
soon, but there is no reference to the matter
in his London interviews. Instead, he
NO PLEASING SOME MEN.
"Did you click for the panto., Maudie?”
“No, it’s all that producer’s fault. He isn’t
consistent. Last year he hears me. and
says, ‘Go and get your voice trained.’
This time he looks at me and says, ‘Run
away and get your legs trained.’”
talked of reviving “Kismet” at the Lyceum,
with Lily Brayton in her old part, and of
going “to try London” with his new method
of producing the Bard, “which proved to
Australians that Shakspeare is not worn
out.” But he was most enthusiastic when he
mentioned his patent cookery apparatus,
which is expected to return him £5OOO a year
from Australia alone. Of his many produc-
tions ip this country, the patent cooker is
obviously regarded as his chef d’osuvre.
“M.P.A.,” from New York: —
Frank Hurley’s Papuan movie, “Pearls and Sav-
ages,” now called “The Lost Tribe,” won him loads
of applause from the daily press and pages of pub-
licity from the illustrateds. It is a remarkable feat
for a new man to give three successful shows at
Carnegie Hall: even Burton Holmes finds it a stiff
job to draw a capacity house at the Carnegie, and
Newman, his rival in the “travelogue” business,
merely uses the famous hall (losing money in the
process) as a kick-off for his tour of the States.
But Hurley did the business with new material and
rattling good photography. The rent for a one-night
showing at the Carnegie gives an Australian a queer
twist in the innards. It is a rare and much vaunted
achievement to make any money there with a movie.
Numbers of feature films are launched on Broadway
without the slightest hope of a profit; but a Broad-
way boom enables the showman to do a thriving
business in other States, so he strives to get one,
even if the management of the movie house or legiti-
mate theatre has to be insulted with a bribe. Not
long ago a wild-animal film made a hit in a Broad-
way house. Matinee and night the houses were filled, and
there was no paper about. When the film was dis-
posed of at a splendid figure, the news leaked out
that the owners had bought thousands of tickets at
the box-office and given them away, paying the
entertainment tax to boot. My own most thrilling
experience in the way of rents was when I paid
£2OO for a morning’s use of the Albert Hall (Lond.),
and the building had to be empty by noon.
“Bad Bill” : I grow tired of hearing how
Albert Whelan duped hardened old critics
by his wonderful imitation of Oscar Girard’s
Ichabod Bronson in the “Belle of New York.”
“Adelaide” (B. 21/8/’24) places the incident
in the city of the same name. I saw
Whelan take Girard’s part at Sydney
Majesty’s a long while before the company
reached Adelaide, and before Adelaide had
seen “The Belle.” And he deceived very
few. It certainly was a clever impersona-
tion, as far as voice and make-up were con-
cerned, but Whelan never caught a fraction
of the granite-like repose which was so dis-
tinguishing a feature of Girard’s perform-
ance. Girard was working his “pipes are
frozen” gag during the same season: it was
no Adelaide invention.
“Cassar’s Ghost”: Rock Phillips, doyen of
Australian property-masters, was driving a
cab in the daytime when he started, in 1886,
as assistant in the prop.-room during a Royal
Comic Opera Co. season in Sydney. Before
that he had been apprentice to a. silversmith,
cabin-boy, potato-peeler, billiard-marker,
navvy, toy-painter, butcher’s assistant, groom,
milkman, tobacconist (his business ended in
a fire), Christy minstrel, drover, maildriver,
wheelwright and surveyor’s chainman. After
the experience as assistant props., Geo.
Rignold put him on as ticket-taker, and,
when “Props” fell ill, Rock Phillips got the
job. From Rignold he went to the Firm;
and a year ago Hugh Ward reckoned that it
would be a master-stroke to lure away the
master-craftsman for his enterprises. Lured
he was accordingly.
“Thersites”: Now that “Old Bill, M.P.,”
has departed from Sydney, many an ancient
mummer is again on the Point, “resting.”
In the variegated crowd which stood _ pati-
ently listening to Old Bill’s pearls of wisdom
on the Sydney Opera House stage, I spotted
several old-time darlings of the gods. One,
a distinguished actor of other days, wore a
smock-frock and a sad smile, but said no
word. A former prominent member of
Emelie Polini’s co. was another. A third
was a one-time actor-manager. And there
were other old friends. They were darned
bad supers, too, for your act-or-r-r makes a
very perfunctory “omnes.” But it was a
pathetic commentary on the glory of the
profession.
“Hamfat” : There was a Chinese opera co. in
Queensland about 20 years ago. I never learned
whether it had come from China or been
formed in Australia, but I met it at Stan-
thorpe, where there is a large Celestial popu-
lation, and it was “doing” a number of simi-
lar places. My impression was that the
audience went to the show to be lulled asleep
(“stunned” is perhaps the word) by monoto-
nous recitatives in the language of Con-
fucius, delivered to the accompaniment of
sounds produced by thumping wood, and
metal, sounds which were such as might be
inflicted on a 3 g.m. tickle-toe crowd by a
slow-motion jazz-band. Jazz music hadn’t
been invented then, but when I heard it for
the first time the conviction came to me that
someone had struck the idea of putting speed
into a Chinese orchestra.
“Max M.”: A perennial joy to me when I
lived in Perth was a notice posted in the
dress-circle of the leading theatre: —
Peanuts Must Not Be Eaten Here.
It’s something they haven’t got in the grand-
circle at Covent Garden, anyway.
“Orb”: “Cymbeline” (B. 14/8/’24) may
not have been seen in Melbourne between
Louise Pomeroy’s production in ’BO and the
contemporary Wilkie revival, but in Sydney
Essie Jenyns played Imogen to the Posthu-
mus of W. J. Holloway at the Criterion in
’B7.
“Hamfat”: The bad old managerial prin-
ciple of “no play no pay” was recently raised
as a defence in a wages case brought by a
seaside entertainer; but the Bench woodened
it out in one act. Six playing nights, and a
matinee if required, constitute a theatrical
week, according to usage and most contracts;
but I have known many instances where
Thespians got a week’s salary for four
weeks’ mumming and hanging around. In a
show which toured Maoriland the manage-
ment set a financial limit on the house, and
below that limit it refused to play. The man-
agement did well; but the actors returned
to Sydney owing the treasury money,
although they had received nothing but their
board and incidental expenses.
“Pantagruel”: “R.Iv.D.N.” (B. 7/8/’24)
speaks of E. J. Carroll’s “few” theatrical
ventures. When one thinks of them, they
are not so few. Carroll has introduced to
Australia Harry Lauder, the original “Peg
o’ My Heart” co. (with Sara Allgood), the
Sistine Choir, Graham Moffat and Stefans-
son. Now, besides Pauline Frederick, men-
tioned by “R.K.D.N.,” he is bringing in
Pavlova, the Russian dancer, and Lauder
again. Pauline Frederick will probably
appear in “The Flame” and “The Spring
Cleaning,” and she intends to make a moving
picture while here. Carroll is an active
spirit in Birch, Carroll and Coyle, Ltd., of
Queensland, who are about to build theatres
specially adapted to the tropics in all the
principal Queensland towns. Among the
ventures in which he is interested are the
A PALPABLE FRAUD.
THE MODEL : “Some of these art unions are awful
swindles. Why, I had a winning ticket in one, and
all the prizes were pictures.”
Prince Edward Theatre in Sydney, and the
new Winter Garden Theatre in Brisbane;
and one of his rooted convictions is. that there
is a big public waiting in Britain for the
right sort of Australian films.
“J.F.'H.” (Lond.) : A Mr. and Miss Tree,
billed as Australians, are presenting a capital
second-sight and thought-transmission turn
at the Coliseum. The lady, blindfolded and
seated with her back to the people, promptly
describes every article handed to her partner
in the auditorium, and plays on the piano
pieces of music passed to him on slips of
paper. And not a word is spoken. In that
respect their act is a vast improvement on
that of the Hellers, who pioneered the illu-
sionist business in Australia half a century
ago. Yet the Hellers were very clever, and
I remember them gratefully. Heller (real
name, Palmer) was a son of the organist at
Canterbury Cathedral and was himself a
brilliant musician. I was a youngster in Gee-
long when he and his wife, Ilaidee, showed
to crowded houses for four weeks, a thing
which had never been done before at Sleepy
Hollow, as it was then, and perhaps hasn’t
been repeated. On the last night of the
season, George Coppin, who imported the
couple, came down from Melbourne, sang a
favorite Cockney ditty, and indulged in some
reminiscences of the early ’fifties, when he
was lessee and manager of the Geelong
Theatre Royal, now, I’m told, the Salvation
Army citadel.
“M.P.A.” (New York) : The new edition
of the Ziegfeld Follies was put together by
two men whose names are familiar to old-
time Australian theatregoers. One is Julian
Mitchell, who went to Australia with the
American dramatic co. which arrived with
“Trilby.” During his stay he saw the
J.C.W. panto “Djin Djin,” and admired it
so greatly that when he returned to New
York lie made it a model for his big money-
spinner, “The Wizard of Oz,” a show which
accelerated Fred Stone's progress in life.
Mitchell’s collaborateur in the Ziegfeld pro-
duction is Edward Royce, a son of comedian
Teddy.
“Lond” : George Robey’s only son (his ma,
Ethel Haydon, was a Melbourne girl) has
finally declined to take to the stage as a
career. “I took a good long look at dad
first, and then decided against it,” he is re-
ported to have said, but it reads 11!lu one
of his father’s. A Cambridge man, like
Robey pere, he has taken a degree in Law.
“Ellae”: In the discussion on stage crowds
my original object has been overlooked. I
endeavored to show that with the limited
resources of to-day an actor-manager should
always try to “suggest” a crowd rather than
exhibit one, and that it doesn’t matter to the
audience whether the effect is gained by
massing 200 supers on the stage, or by skil-
fully manipulating six or so “off,” as un?
as it is gained. Undoubtedly the George
Rignold way of showing a surging crowd that
really did surge to the uttermost limits of
the scenery was the best, but arbitration
awards and the like have hopelessly killed it.
And the actor who tries to get the same
effect with two dozen as G.R. did with 200
is merely galvanising the corpse.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Gus Neville, who was
mentioned recently as having been with Allan
Wilkie since Wilkie started in Australia, is
a long-distance man if ever there was one.
In his theatrical career he has had compara-
tively few engagements, because each one
lasted for years. He started as a call-boy
when Myra Kemble was appearing as lead-
ing lady, and he was for a long time with
Dampier. His five years as juvenile lead
with King’s stock company in Brisbane is
probably the champion long engagement in
an Australian town other than Sydney or
Melbourne.
“D.W.” : “La Demoiselle de Magazin,” pro-
duced by Belgian Consul Segaert, and acted
with obvious enjoyment before an apprecia-
tive audience at St. James’s, Sydney, is one
of several plays written by
the same authors; the best
is “Le Mariage de Mile.
Beulemans,” which has often
been played in France as well
as in the country of its
origin. Light as they are,
these plays are worthy of
serious attention, for they
are the legitimate offspring
of the comedy of manners,
and give true pictures of the
habits and ways of thinking
and talking of the pre-war
Belgian bourgeoisie. To the
same category, in spite of
its tragedy, belongs Maeter*
linck’s “Bourgmestre de Stil-
monde,” which seems likely
to live on account of its
sober fidelity to character as
well as fact. Belgium lias
achieved at least the begin-
nings of a truly national
drama, and is in that re-
spect an example to Aus-
tralia. Yet as a self-govern-
ning unit it is considerably
younger than this nation,
which slakes its thirst for
theatrical entertainment with
vulgar Yankee revues and moving-pictures.
“Peter Pan” : George M. Cohan’s Austra-
lian royalties must be turning him in some-
thing handsome. His “Little Nellie Kelly”
is at Sydney Opera House, his “Rise of Rosie
O’Reiliy” at Melbourne Princess’s, and his
“Seven Keys to Baldpate” at Brisbane Royal,
where Ken Brampton’s stock co. is installed.
Have we ever before had three plays from the
same pen running simultaneously in Aus-
tralia, one in each of the three eastern
capitals ?
“Norbell”: That par. of “T.0.1.’5” about
Luscombe Searelle and Tom Margets (B.
14/7/’24) stirs memories. Five-and-twenty
years ago Tom Margets had slung the show-
man’s game and was a fairly prosperous fur-
niture man and upholsterer in Bendigo. He
used to help the local amateurs occasionally,
and was the head and front of the Richard-
sons’ Show at the Easter Fair each year.
Long before that Luscombe Searelle had put
on his “Estrella” at the old Princess’s, Mel-
bourne, under the Williamson, Garner and
Musgrove banner. The tuneful comic opera
had a great cast, including Nellie Stewart,
Fanny Liddiard, Edwin Kelly and Phil Day,
who made a hit as the doddering Doge of
Venice. Searelle afterwards did his “Boba-
dil” at the Bijou. He finished up, I believe,
in S’Africa, where he was a big theatrical
pot.
“A.P.”: Maggie Moore played Ruth in
the first showing of “The Pirates of Pen-
zance” at Melbourne Royal in ISBI. She
had taken the part in Sydney not long be-
fore, although she wasn’t in the original
cast. I think Acton Blair was the first
Australian Ruth. John Forde was likewise
in both Melbourne and Sydney productions;
he, too, is still in the business.
“F.L.H.”: When “Norbell” (B. 31/7/’24)
declared that “The Fairy Circle” was the
second of the Williamson-Moore productions
at Melbourne in 1874, and that it thudded,
he bumped a bit himself. “Struck Oil” hav-
ing sailed along for eight weeks, “Kerry”
and “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” were put on to-
gether. “The Fairy Circle” got a show
early in October that year, and lasted a fort-
night—just as long as the double bill. By
the way, it was in the following drama —
Brougham’s version of “The Old Curiosity
Shop,” called “Little Nell” —that Maggie
Moore’s brother, Jimmy, first shook a leg in
Melbourne.
“Mancam”: To me the most interesting
feature of “Old Bill, M.P.,” was George Dean,
who made the impossible Lord Torymore
seem almost human. George has a lifetime
of good stage work behind him as singer and
mummer, mostly in vaudeville. As far back
as 1880 he was playing an important part in
George Musgrove’s production of “La Fille
du Tambour Major” at Melbourne Opera
House.
OSCAR HASH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Asche is remarkably pleased with the new
cooker which lie invented in Australia and has
patented throughout the world. He expects to
realise £5OOO a year from the Australian royalties.
Ilis business friends declare that the cooker should
make him a millionaire. Cooking is Mr. Asche|s
hobby. He does most of the family cooking at his
farm in the Cotswold hills.” — Sun cable.
His fame may yet about the world ring louder,
An* greener laurels deck his massive brow,
For dishes that some piquant curry powder
With charm inimitable shall endow,
Than for dramatic triumphs. Asche’s chowder
May knock the stuffing out of “Chu-Chin-Chow,”
And with financial returns profuser
Reward its gifted author and producer.
No more from well-upholstered ambuscado
His generous bulk emerges on the stage;
He mouths no more Falstaffian bravado
By sack made merry, or convulsed with rage
Smashes the crockery as Maldonado.
Arts less spectacular his time engage,
Choice potape a la maitre and entree bosker
Leap into being at the touch of Oscar.
No more, as ample Ali Shar, resounding
Plaudits he wins when gorgeous “Cairo” fills
The house to bursting. Salmis he’s compounding,
And kedgeree, among the Cotswold hills—
Where, after Reynard o’er the landscape bounding,
The reckless Gordon came some early spills.
Yet feel ho fear for Asche; e’en were he able,
He’d hardly chase what’s useless for the table.
Secure from sneers of ill-informed detractors
He jugs the hares and fricassees the chooks,
For fuller recompense than ever actors
May hope to earn it well may he be looks.
Among the human race’s benefactors
Who sets the Thespians beside the cooks ?
On, Oscar, on! No man of sense belittles
The flair you have for drama- —or for victuals.

Electricity’s Problems
\
WESTINGHOUSE, with unceasing and tireless energy in the
field of electricity, has solved many of the puzzles that be-
set the earlier application of electric current. (
It made practical the Parsons Steam Turbine for electrical gen-
eration.
It perfected reduction gears by which the terrific velocity of the
turbine could be safely yoked to the propeller shafts of steamships.
Westinghouse developed the transformer by which alternating
current came into general use, effecting wider and more econom-
ical distribution of electric energy.
It originated and developed the induction motor which todaj
does such a large share of the world’s work.
Westinghouse stands as a beacon to the world, pointing the way
of progress on electrical apparatus.
Tn arranging for the distribution of its products in Australia,
Westinghouse will be pleased to hear from firms interested in
acting as distributors.

All the world over Rexona Girls hold the palm for Health and Beauty.
In far-away Hollywood, the home of the Movie Picture Stars, health
and beauty are a necessary asset to success.
Hollywood has its Rexona Girls as well as Australia, for the Movie
Stars must have beauty—that natural beauty which only Rexona and Rexona
Soap give to skin and hair.
Rexona and Rexona Soap are the Rexona Girls aids to beauty. With
their assistance she rids her skin of blemishes and pimples, keeps her hair
and scalp in such perfect condition that she is the envy of all her friends.
But the Rexona Girl is not selfish—she does not keep the secret to herself,
but wishes all the world to rejoice with her. Over 5000 girls have written
to the Company the glad news that they are Rexona Girls and find the Rexona
Products the most wonderful aids to health and beauty.
They say that Rexona Soap keeps their skin and hair healthy and
beautiful, and should be used by every girl who values her good looks. 1 hey
say they are always finding new uses for Rexona, the Rapid Healer, and many
of their letters contain a photograph which shows by its beauty that these
users are getting the best results in health and happiness. Are you satisfied
with your looks? Why not become a Rexona Girl, too?

tion. We are only up to 32 so far... .L.G.R.: The

to Bourke... .Reppils: Not enough meat in it....

Spero: The bird yarn goes too thin.... Burrawang:

delightful fancy:—
He loaded his gun,
And when that w'as done
The cat had reached F sharp,
And he ground his teeth,
Said, “AVe’ll never have peace
Till you are playing a harp.”
At the first pot
The cat was shot,
And expired with a doleful howl;
The owner, the goat,
His heart was smote,
And hanged himself with a towel.

the place....Steelink: Commonplace prose written
to look like verse... .C.AV. (Camberwell): Any baby

to be.... J.J.D.: Not enough in it.... Admirer: Far
too ragged.... E.H.F.: Hashes things that have been

And thus did chance in th’ sea romance
AY’liile a spiteful gale did blow
Th’ Lifeboats birth and its sterling worth
At th’ wreck of th’ city of Glasgow'.
... .Margaret; There shouldn't be any difficulty about
doing those things, but they seem pretty futile....
AY.J.D.: The sketches miss....D.M.C.; That yarn
has been told scores of times, but not often worse.
.... Tesse J.: In the manner of the cheapest novel-
ettes. . ..E.T.T.: There have been many worse first

guage. .. .G.A. (Camden) ; Too often out of tune....

very little better is published in some of the maga-
zines M.AV. (Gippsland) : Heavy verse with a bad
prose effect Susan B.; Come, let the “Solemn
AVarning” soak well in:—
You went against my solemn warning
On the day that you became a wife,
For I told you marriage was a serious occurrence
An l liable to last for life;
And now he’s upstick and away to Frisco,
And here’s you slaving at the tub ;
And now (between you, me and the bedpost)
AVho was the right one every time and who’s the
mug ?
I told you he was a snake in fox’s clothing,
Shedding oil all along the track,
But you looked into those false teeth so smiling,
And laughed behind poor old mother’s back.
You know you wouldn’t hark to reason
AYhen I tried to use the curb or whip,
And now 1 you’ve become a solemn warning
To girls who sneer and say that Mum gives them
the pip.
... .G.H.L.M.: Dreadful stuff in murderous hand-
W’riting Molly H.: It isn’t “a poem.” AVhy
imitate American rubbish at the very time when the
Americans themselves are getting sick of it ?....
J. : Not up to the mark... .AV.H.B.: A variant
on an old theme that doesn’t sound true P.M.D.:
Not badly done, but doesn’t make us want to print
it. .. .Teak: Doesn’t get near... .X Rad; Sorry there
is no space for such essays. .. .T.AV.S.: Don’t tap-
tap-tap like that at your subject. Swing your
hammer and drive your point home Bananalander:
Thanks, and good luck to you... .P.G.K.: Rather
long for the subject; but by no means badly done.
....Circus: Lame in all its feet.... Frank AY.: Not
much meat in it.... Brum: Comb your brains.
You’ve got ideas, but they are just pitchforked on
to paper.

“Citrus”: Queensland’s Director of Fruit
Culture has endorsed the claims made on
behalf of the new Yeppoon seedless orange,
the Byfield seedless. It is said to be per-
fectly spherical', very juicy, of delicious
flavor, with a minimum of fibre and a thin
skin—the perfect golden apple of the Hes-
pcrides. Southern experts will be eager to
sample it; but the Australian orange world
has not yet forgotten the perpetration of
the Navelencia, which has all the Navel’s
buxom beauty with none of its virtues—-the
courtesan of the orange grove.

“West Darling”: Glenlyon, in the dog
country between Broken Hill and Wilcannia,
lias been sold in Adelaide to a local Glenlyon
Pastoral Co.: £40,000 bought the 300,000
acres (leasehold), with about 500 cattle,
12,500 sheep and 60 horses.
“P.M.”: I don't know what the English
importers insist on in Australian butters
(B. 7/8/’24), but I do know that the article
has only to be 80 per cent, pure butter fat,
either for Australian export or for local con-
sumption. “Geo. Rich’s” ratio of 100 in
115 is 87 per cent.; the statutory limit was
once 82 per cent., but was lowered to SO
some time ago. Only 6 per cent, of salt is
allowed.
* * * *
“X2X”: The recent English prohibition of
formaldehyde as a meat-preservative is amply
warranted. Though formaldehyde undoubt-
edly possesses powerful preserving properties,
it is liable to chemical changes. Movements
of temperature cause it to break up into other
substances, such as methyl alcohol and formic
acid, both of which are extremely injurious
to human health. This has led to its being
banned as a food-preservative by practically
every civilised country in the world.
“Cwrw Bach”: It is not the English im-
porters (B. 7/S/’24), but the Commonwealth
Government, which stipulates how much
moisture Australian butter may contain. The
English legal standard for imported butter
is 16 per cent, moisture, and the Common-
wealth knocks off one to be on the safe
side. The American standard is 20 per cent.
The ideal would be about 12 per cent., but
butter-making in this warm climate is an art
which reaches the ideal about as often as
other arts.
* * * *
While abroad picking up wrinkles on road-
making nothing has impressed Calder, Chair-
man of Vic. Country Roads Board, more than
the work of the highway chemist in North
Carolina, U.S.A. This official’s job is to
examine the constituents of the formation of
each road and suggest what “complementary”
elements, obtainable within easy distance, are
required to make the track suitable to carry
the traffic. It will not be surprising if
Calder lassoes a chemist as soon as he gets
back and adds him to his staff.
* * * *
"Sturt” : Goodman, of the Adelaide trams,
who is going round the world to study city
traffic problems, advjses the Trust that he has
ordered 20 Mack ’buses in the U.S.A. for a
start. One will be complete; the other 19
will be the running parts only, and will have
bodies built for them in Adelaide. The
Trust, being asked why Goodman bought in
America instead of England, replies merely
that “the advantages gained seem to out-
weigh any that may appear to accrue from
buying in Great Britain.”
* * * *
“Machete”: Somewhat belatedly the Com-
monwealth Treasury is asking for legislation
to forbid the sale of German notes in Aus-
tralia. The impudenpe of the fraud is
amazing. One Sydney resident has been
advertising a ten-million-mark note for £2O,
the actual value being some small fraction
of a penny. And a story is told of what a
lady said when she brought a bundle of paper
marks into the Commonwealth Bank
for valuation, and was told that three-
thousandths of a farthing was as near as the
officials could get to it.
* * * *
“Adamascus” : Store cattle are coming into
their own again, and some big sales have
been reported. Diamond Downs (C.Q.)
cattle sold in Brisbane recently up to £2l
155., and the average was the best for years.
Then Thomas Purcell, of Galway Downs
(C.-W.Q.), has sold 10,000 head in excellent
condition on a weight basis to the- old
A.M.E. Co., now the Swift Co. These are
for slaughtering at the co.’s' works on the
Brisbane River. Competition between the
meatworkers’ representatives is very keen,
vthich is all to the good of the stockowner,
who now prefers to sell his cattle direct,
instead of sending them to Homebush. Other
sales are reported, notably the purchase on
the weight basis by Borthwick’s of cattle
from Gilpippie, Mount Howlett and Pal-
parara.
* * * *
“Lou”: Prior to the latest Queensland
pastoral award the cook’s rate was 9s. per
mouth, but the sheep barbers mostly paid an
extra bob. Since Judge McCauley has given
the cooks a statutory 10s., and the shearers
an extra dollar a hundred, the former have
been asking their fellow-unionists for 11s.,
and some sheds have witnessed trouble in
consequence. At Cassillis, out from Rich-
mond, Curry-and-Rice gave the shearers a
week to come to his terms, or get someone
to fill his place, and they caved in. It seems
only justice that the shearers, who added an
extra bob on to the Court’s 9s. when sheep
were £2 a hundred, should spring another
shilling with sheep at £2 ss. Yet the “un-
precedented prosperity” argument that won
the shearers their increase failed to secure the
cook his rise till it was backed by direct
action.
* * * *
“Barcoo”; An indication of what the land
boom is going to be like in Central Queens-
land in 1927, when a very large slice of the
Longreach, Muttaburra and Barcaldine
(C.Q.) leases fall in, was given at the Land
Court, Longreach, on August 5. There were
over 6000 applicants for a single block of
country, 10,000 acres, at a rental of 6d. per
acre, and the deposits tendered in currency
and bank-marked cheques totted up to the
sum of £1,600,000. The incoming tenant
gets 28 years’ lease from the Government,
and has to pay for existing improvements,
such as fencing and water conservation, at
valuation. The leases of all the sheep sta-
tions of large area in that vast district will
fall in during the next 10 years, a few imme-
diately, but most of them three years henc<-
and from then on to 1934, after which there
will be no more large runs in the district—
probably 20,000 acres will be the maximum.
At the expiration of the lease —mostly 28
years as the Land Act stands—the block may
be again subdivided, the holder of the lease
at the end of the term having a preferential
claim to a living area.

MELBOURNE‘S
0..000Q ARGENTINE WORLD FLIGHT
From Rangoon (Burmah) to Con-
stantinople the three United States
Army Aeroplanes, in their remark-
able round-the-world flight, used
Shell Spirit, and for the final gruel-
ling trip from England to America,
via Iceland and Greenland, supplies
of Shell Spirit have been laid down. So
again Shell proves its unrivalled superiority.
u
By changing over to Shell for the
worst stages of their journey, repre-
senting the two extremes of tropic
heat and Arctic cold, these fearless
American airmen paid an unexampled
tribute to Shell. Thus a further
page is written of the world-wide
supremacy of Shell Spirit, in the highways of
the air, as well as the highways of the earth.
English, American, Argentine and Australian Airmen choose “SHELL
SQUADRON-LEADER McLAREN , who abandoned
his flight after a thrilling fight against heavy odds, was
using Shell Spirit and Shell Lubricating Oil. From Tokio
he cabled:—
“At this stage, and after 11,000 miles’ flight, wish express
appreciation your organisation, which has provided Shell Spirit
wherever required. QUALITY OIL AND SPIRIT HAS BEEN
SUPER EXCELLENT THROUGHOUT, AND I COULD NOT
WISH FOR BETTER RESULTS.”
In the remarkable flight from LONDON TO CAPE-
TOWN Shell Spirit was used.
MAJOR ZANNI, the famous Argentine Flyer, now
encircling the globe on behalf of his Government is using
Shell Spirit and Shell Lubricating Oil throughout.
SIR ROSS SMITH and his companions flew from
England to Australia on Shell Spirit.
SIR JOHN ALCOCK’S non-stop flight across the
Atlantic succeeded on Shell Spirit.
The first flight from LONDON TO JAPAN was
accomplished on Shell Spirit.
What further evidence of Shell’s superiority can be required;
and the name “SHELL” on Motor Spirit and Lubricating Oils
IS AN EQUAL GUARANTEE TO EVERY AUSTRALIAN
MOTORIST of the same supreme dependable quality.

Near the broken column over Adam Lind-
say Gordon’s grave in the Brighton (Vic.)
Cemetery is a simple granite cross bearing
the text, “The memory of the just is blessed.
It marks the resting-place of George Higin-
botham, Vic.’s greatest Chief Justice.
“Wessel”: Australia’s first export of meat
to Asia occurred in 1840, when the barque
George sailed from Sydney for the Canton
River with 170 tons of salt meat. The con-
signment was to help feed the British forces
employed against China in the opium war.
“Ivapai”: The imposing matron left her
limousine and sailed into the city emporium,
where an obsequious shopwalker besought her
pleasure. “Kindly direct me,” she said, sur-
veying him through her lorgnette, “to your
machinery department.” “This way, if you
please, Madam,” indicated the elegant infor-
mation bureau; “what is it you wish to see .’ 1 ’
The haughty lady swished into the lift. A
mousetrap,” she said impressively.
The theft of a shilling from a village shop
is alleged to have been the reason for Cap-
tain Cook taking to the sea. An alternative
yarn is that the youngster was changing an
old coin for a bright one, but his employer
would not believe him, and the boy ran away.
There is probably some element of truth in
these stories, which' are, at. any rate, well
known on Teeside. A shop in Staithes even
boasts a piece of the counter and the till
which held the tempting shilling.
“C.S.C.”: The weightiest member of the
Vic. Labor party, Socialist J. P. Jones, was
born on a Tas. sheep-run, where his parents
died during his infancy: He cleared out of
the cold little island to Vic. penniless, and
got a job driving a cart. His wage wouldn’t
buy him breeches, so Jones manufactured a
.pair; then two or three for his friends; then
for everybody. The business grew, and re-
cently he turned it into a co-operative con-
cern.
If Vic.’s Labor Government manages to
induce a supine House to agree to the rein-
statement of the police-strikers of November
last it will be impossible for Nicholson to
continue as chief. At a police picnic nine
months ago he said the strikers would never
go back while he was in command. His
three years’ term will expire in April, 1925,
and, as he is 62, he cannot go back to the
job of superintendent. Still, he is entitled to
a pension of £650 a year, and there is some
consolation in that.
“Van Cat” : Old habits linger even though
occupations may change. A Groperland cocky
who was once a publican bought a tractor.
It was delivered in going order by the agent,
but almost immediately something went
wrong with the works. The local agent was
beaten and sent to Perth for the expert. He
spent a whole day on it and half the night,
without result. Next morning, as the expert
was getting ready to attack the problem anew,
the cocky gave him a clue. “I don’t know
what’s the matter with it,” he declared plain-
tively. “It ought to go. I didn’t break the
petrol down very much. I only put a pint of
water to the tin.”
These, congestionists haven’t even the merit
of originality. In 1840 Governor Gipps
jumped with both feet on the claim made
by the Hentys, and also by the first settlers
at Port Phillip, that they had done good
service to the Government and the Colony
of N. S. Wales by opening up districts that
might otherwise have remained unoccupied
for a number of years. “So far from con-
sidering this any advantage,” wrote Gipps,
“I look on it as directly the reverse, not
only because the dispersion of our popula-
tion is increased by it, but also because we
are forced to incur prematurely consider-
able expense in the formation of new estab-
lishments.”
“Simon” : I want to nominate George An-
derson, of Redfern, Sydney, for the Full
Cradle Stakes (B. 7/8/’24). Born in Kent-
street, Sydney, 80 years ago, he can still be
found on Redfern railway bridge with his
hiring van. He has been married five
times ; his tally of children is 32, 22 of them
girls. Excepting five sons killed in the late
war all his children are living. His present
wife is under 40, and has contributed eight
to the total, the youngest a six-year-old. The
old man fought in the Maori War of ’66,
the Soudan and the Boer War. Every
now and then lie jogs round in a sulky to
see his grandchildren, the job taking three
or four days. Pie has promised to round up
his great-grandchildren and let me have the
full statistics when he gives up work.
“Hamer”: That Australians have long
been drinking Australian whisky, albeit often
Without recognising it in the “house” whisky
of sundry hotels and clubs, is proved by the
very considerable output of the Australian
distilleries. The putting forward of Aus-
tralian whisky at sixpence a nip in Sydney
and sevenpence in Melbourne is by way of
a campaign to familiarise Australians with
their own product. Actually, the distilling
craft in the Commonwealth is so old that
the business which has now developed out
of Joshua’s has two employees of 40 years’
standing and 27 of over 30 years. And this
distillery, which has absorbed two others,
isn’t the only one in Melbourne working on
a large scale. Seeing that Australia is the
only country in the world with a compulsory
spirit standard, the old prejudice against the
local juice should long since have been over-
come.
“Herodot”: Things had been going pretty
badly with the two racecourse spielers; the
last country meeting that they had attended
had left them with the price of only one
ticket back to town. Sitting on the plat-
form they had been gloomily debating the
problem; it wasn’t till the whistle of the
train was heard that an inspiration came.
It was late at night; one of the pair removed
his soft felt hat, rolled it up and put it
under his coat, and walked swiftly along the
train, until he came to a compartment
tenanted entirely by Chinamen. His briskly
official “Tickets, please,” set half a dozen
Pagans holding out their pasteboard slips for
examination. Selecting one lie handed back
the rest in a bunch and slammed the carriage-
door, his pressing problem solved. Half an
hour later a volubly protesting Chinaman,
who declined to purchase another ticket,
was being bundled off the train by a real
examiner.

Can You Tell the
Cause of Your Trouble ?
Are-'you sometimes discouraged and think you’ll never get any
better?
Can you tell what is the matter with you, or what makes you
sick?
Do you know that about nine-tenths of all sickness is caused
by Kidney Trouble?
Have you ever stopped to think that your kidneys may be the
cause of your poor health?
Most people do not realise how much work the kidneys are
required to do every day.
Every drop of blood in the body must pass through and be
filtered by the kidneys thousands of times a day.
How can they do their work well if they are sick?
If your kidneys need treatment, DR. SHELDON’S GIN PILLS,
the wonderful Kidney Remedy, will ifrove to be just the medicine
you need.
GIN
PILLS
WILL
HELP YOU
It is no longer necessary for anyone to suffer with Backache,
Kidney, Bladder or Urinary troubles, or to contend with Rheuma-
tism or Stiff Joints, for Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills quickly remove all
such troubles.
Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills are the most wonderful Remedy yet
devised for ridding the system of uric acid and driving out all the
poisonous impurities. They are entirely different from all other
Remedies, and act on the principle of cleansing out the poisons and
remedying the cause. No matter how long you have suffered, how
old you are, or what you have used, the principle of Gin Pills is
such that it is practically impossible to take them into the human
system without results. They start to work the minute you take
them, and they help you from the first time that you use them.'

Horizon Hills.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
UPON the blue Horizon Hills,
The Hills of Far Away,
The chalice of the evening spills
The last gold dregs of day.
A golden dust such as the bee
Mines from the yellow broom,
And gathers from the wattle-trees
Bowed by their w(fight of bloom.
There like an ancient castle keep,
With turret and with tower,
They rise o’er precipice and steep
In amethystine flower.
Their falls are white as bridal veils
At springtime marriages,
With foamy gossamer that trails
A splendor through the trees.
The tall gums ooze out sap upon
Their boles in amber pale,
And in dusk groves of cinnamon
Sings a swart nightingale.
My fancy like a timid faun
Athirst for waters cool
Treads warily through blanching dawn
Down to the wonder pool.
For here indeed is haunted ground
In silence strangely mute,
Where in an instant may be found
Old Pan with cleft goat-foot.
Shy, curious things, guessed here and there,
Peer out with beaded eyes,
And elves illusive as the air
Meet, to their own surprise.
Here uninvited sound and rude
Must cease to make a stir.
In sacred groves of sandalwood
And patriarchal fir.
Those hills seem far by measured miles.
As yon combed filmy tress
Of cirrus cloud where Morning smiles
Remote and bodiless.
Yet hither I at last have come
From my far distant vale.
Where are the globes of amber gum?
Where is the nightingale?
Where, too, the airy nymphs and fauns,
Plumed birds-of-paradise,
The lily-borders on the lawns
Of cinnamon and spice?
Across the level plain I view,
While these new hills I roam.
Those far-seen bills of deeper blue —
The dearer hills of home.
JIAORTLAND.
DARIUS.
The Scent of Youth.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE had been born and bred in the coun-
try, but the city had called to him
and made him part of it, as it has
done to so many of his kind. Gradually
lie had lost touch with his people and the
past, and not for many years had he given
more than an occasional thought to any-
thing outside his daily interests; his life in
the city had settled into a pleasant routine
that satisfied him completely. Now, in an
instant, the past seemed to matter im-
mensely. He felt a sudden longing to be
done with this easy, drifting existence and
to escape into something more substantial
and real.
The city had bewildered him at first with
its hurrying, well-dressed crowds, its shops
and its women in colorful frocks which they
wore with such grace. Then it fascinated
him. On Saturday afternoons and Sundays
he never tired of the parks and gardens
where green lawns and noble trees made such
a glorious setting for the beds of sweet-smell-
ing flowers. It was all so different. He
knew when the lawns were mown in Hyde
Park, and he stood and envied the laborer
who was paid for the privilege of releasing
such a perfume as the grass gave out when it
was cut. The florists’ shops were full of the
most amazing and extraordinary treasures.
He secured a position in one of these shops
as a messenger, and it was not long before
lie knew most of the flowers by name. Their
beauty was a revelation to him, and had he
not been offered a better job as a draper’s
assistant be would have been well content
to pass the remainder of his years amongst
the violets and roses and sweet-peas.
The florist’s shop had awakened in him
a taste for color that had helped him im-
mensely in his business. After twenty-three
years he was still with the same firm, and
m>w he was head of the hosiery department.
He had never married, not from lack of
opportunity, for plenty of girls at the shop
had cast their eyes in his direction, but he
liked his mode of life too much to submit
himself to any other’s impulses. Besides,
he was. in love with the city. He
l ove< L it at all times, and in all its moods.
It offered him its inexhaustible variety; his
evenings and week-ends were never duil, and
the community-life of the shop filled his days
pleasantly. He merged into the crowd. Even
the walk up George-street from the ferry
to the shop was a delight, and Pitt-street
hi the dusk of a September day. with the
s>ky darkening to a more intense blue, seemed
to take on a habit of witchery that was
comforting and yet wistful—like the calling
ct the doves in the Botanic Gardens on warm
Sunday afternoons. He came often to the
city in the evenings, and walked the streets
inspecting the windows filled with every
luxury. Or he went to a theate or a pic-
cure-show. I-Ie had grown somewhat staid
hnd middle-aged in appearance, and his bald
pot w;as larger than he cared to think, but
He thrilled still in his quiet way at the sight
a pretty woman in evening-dress. A foot-
ball or a cricket match on Saturday afternoon
And the beaches or a quiet Sunday in the
boarding-house garden completed his week
In a moment all this had lost its attrac-
tion At so slight a cause the sights and
founds and scents of his boyhood came to his
biemory undimmed by the passage of years'
JHe experienced an impulse that was new to
-K f ‘ k . “gain. The desire was so
strong that it frightened him.
Ho had felt something like this only once
before —on his first day from home when ho
had sat in the little Darlinghurst room afraid
to face the ordeal of his fii\st boarding-house
dinner. He remembered thinking that his
father was even then driving the cows into
the yard for milking, sinking sometimes nj*
to liis knees in mud, sometimes to the ankles
only.
lie saw the little house which had been
his home from birth. It had four rooms and
a kitchen that was always full of fowls
despite liis mother’s frantic shooings. It
was built of rough weatherboard with a cor-
rugated-iron roof and ceilings of calico. The
walls and ceilings were whitewashed, and
the whitewash dame off on your fingers or on
your clothes if you leant against it. The
ground all round the house was scratched
bare by the fowls, and in summer dust rose
in clouds with every little wind and covered
everything; even the water in the tanks,
drained from the roof, was discolored. In the
wnterhole at the foot of the stony ridge, where
the cows drank, millions of mosquitoes
spawned in an ecstasy of hate. At the back
of the house was a scrubby rise full of
rocks and spiky bushes and bulldog ants.
There a snake had bitten and killed Snap,
the wall-eyed terrier he had loved so well.
The rise shut out the cooling breezes of
summer, so that the house was as hot by
night as by day.
Across from the dwelling was the cream-
house, the cowyard and the milking-shed.
Here the cattle-droppings dried to a light
powder in the sun and floated into the milk.
In the winter and in times of rain the yard
became a sea of mud which covered you from
head to foot as you worked. The cows spat-
tered themselves with filth which matted in
your hair as you pressed your head against
their bodies at milking times. Everyone was
wet, uncomfortable and bad tempered. The
musty smell of damp clothes filled the house,
and the rain leaked through the walls. It
came through the roof and had stained and
rotted the ceiling of his room. It made an
interminable and melancholy plonk! plonk!
in the tin dish set to catch it. How that
sound had terrified him, waking in the dark!
It sounded like the steady tramp of a giant
coming to bear him to his castle, where he
would be made to turn the handle of a separa-
tor for ever. The harsh croaking of the frogs
in the waterhole was a weird and fitting
accompaniment, and the moaning of the cows
through the night reminded him of the mal-
evolent ghosts in the stories of terror that his
father told for their entertainment as they
sat before the fire on Sunday evenings in the
winter.
That separator—how he had hated it!
It stood in a corner of the cream-house,
which it shared with the milking-pails and
the old ten-gallon cans. This was the clean-
est spot on the farm, in deference to the rid-
iculous whimsies of the dairy-inspector. It
was better built than the house, with neatly
whitewashed w r alls, a cement floor and a win-
dow with real glass in it. When it was not
in use the door was locked so that the fowls
and calves could not treat it as they treated
the rest of the place. Rut he looked upon
it only as the Temple of the Separator which
he had turned morning and evening for seven
days a week since lie was big enough to
reach the handle. How his wrists and back
had ached! And how his head had throbbed
with the smell of the infernal oil that was
used to soothe the vitals of the humming
beast! An hour of this after milking eight
cows made you strong all right; and when
you had finished and had carried the skim
to the calyes and the pigs, and had washed
the separator and the cans, you were glad
to have a good feed of cow-beef and go to
bed. Ah, there was no sleep so sound as
country sleep, and you felt really sorry to
get up at five the next morning!
He had been reckoned a clever lad, and
his father had allowed him to make the
most of the meagre chances that offered to
acquire an education. Intermittently, when
they were not too busy on the farm, he at-
tended the little bush school. He liked school.
It was a restful place where you were allowed
to sit down for hours at a time, and there
were no cows. The five-mile walk there and
back was a particularly vivid memory. And
the scent that came from McGregor’s heap of
blood-and-bone fertiliser, from the burning
hooves at the forge, and from the hides
drying in the sun at the village slaughter-
yard.
On Sunday afternoons he had gone to
Sunday-school, for his parents were strict
Melobites, and although they did not attend
service themselves they were firm in their
determination that their children should be
given the religious instruction that is so
necessary to the young. The lessons were
arranged so that they did not interfere with
milkii\g, and there was no reason, when the
morning’s work was finished, why the child-
ren should not spend the time until half-
past four in a manner befitting the Day of
Rest. He became an enthusiastic student of
the Scriptures. Brightly-colored little pic-
tures were given to those who memorised the
verses set each Sunday, and other boys
would exchange these for cigarette-cards. One
Christmas his collection of little pictures had
made him head of the school, and he was
presented with a copy of “Oliver Twist.”
He thrilled at the description of Oliver’s
journey to London, and the Artful Dodger
became his hero. He determined that one
day he. too, would seek his fortune in the
great city.
Then his chance had come. At the local
show his father, in an expansive spirit, due
probably to alcohol, committed himself to
the purchase of a four-set milking-machine.
When this was installed and working it be-
came apparent that he was required no longer.
Ephraim, his younger brother, was now big
enough to turn the separator, and his father
began to show some concern for his eldest
son’s future.
“My boy,” his father said, “for sixteen
years I have fed and clothed you, but the
time has now come when you must fend for
yourself.”
“Yes, father,” he said.
“Silence, boy.” said his father. “Young
Eph. is now big enough to wear my old
clothes and do any odd jobs about the place,
so I don’t see why you should expect to be
kept in idleness any longer.”
“No, father,” he replied.
So it was decided that he should go to the
city. His mother, a thin, silent woman, with
none of the joviality of his father, had saved

— t The Great Pine-Air Cure Tor
Coughs, colds
& BRONCHITIS
There is no better medicine for Throat, Chest and Lungs than
the rich balsamic air of the pine forests. Through the skill of the
pharmaceutical chemist the potent healing virtue of this balsamic
pine-air is now captured and condensed along with
other volatile medicaments into those wonderful
breathable tablets known as Peps.
To take the Peps treatment you simply peel off the
silver wrapper and allow the tablet to slowly dissolve
in the mouth. The powerful chest-strengthening
medicine liberated in the form of fumes is breathed
deeply and naturally straight into the lungs quite
contrary to the effect of drug-laden mixtures and liquid “cough-cures”
which can only act through the blood. As the Peps medicine passes through
the throat and air-tubes it finds out and exterminates dangerous germs:
removes soreness and weakness of chest, strengthens and heals tender,
inflamed bronchial tubes, and quickly cures the worst cough, cold or
chest trouble.

five pounds from her egg money to pay the
deposit on a second-hand piano for little
Annie, and his father agreed to give him this
to help him on his way. His last week on
the farm passed in a dream. No longer did
he feel the frost on his bare feet as lie raced
through the dank paddocks in the dawn
chasing up the cows. He forgot to hate the
separator, and the clouds of flies that rose
to greet him when he threw food to the pigs
no longer annoyed him. At night when the
rest of the family was asleep he lit a candle
and read again the thrilling exploits of the
Artful Dodger and Bill Sikes.
The whole family drove to the station in
the spring-cart to see him off. His mother
cried, and little Annie cried, too. They were
sorry he was going. As the train drew into
the station his mother threw her arms round
his neck and kissed him, and he dropped
his bag on his father’s foot. His father gave
him his blessing and bundled him into an
empty compartment. They waved and called
to him until the train disappeared round
the bend.
It all came back to him in an instant as
he sat on the deck of the Neutral Bay ferry-
boat, and he forgot to enjoy the color that
the early sun brought out in the harsh stones
of Pinchgut or the shadowy outline of Brad-
ley’s Head in the distance.
Slowly the old mud-punt with its noisome
load had wallowed past the ferry on its way
to sea.

“Shy-Collegey.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MY friend Phil the Showman lately
wrote to me from a town on the
Western line. I was busy when I
received his letter, and, partly as a joke,
dictated a rigidly formal reply, acknow-
ledging his communication and hoping that
he would bring me a further favorable re-
port as to the state of the country on his
return to the city. Miss Jackson typed this
in due course on our office paper, which bears
an imposing list of the names of the com-
mitte'e, including many leading citizens.
Yesterday Phil called on me.
“ ’Strutli!” he remarked, “you’re as ’ard
ter see as tli’ main squeeze up at Guv’mint
’Ouse. It’s as ’ard ter git in ’ere as it is
ter get outer th’ boob. ’Ow’s th’ game?”
I told him all was well, and asked if he
had received my letter.
“That stiff yon sent me ter Dubbo?” asked
Phil. “Blime, it saved a man’s life, that
there letter did. This way. I went up Narro-
mine an’ Peak ’lll with Chewey Saunders’s
snake show. Cow of a game—useter give me
the Willies, dinlcum. I done th’ spruikin’
an’ Chewey tlr charmin’; but snake-charmin’
ter cockics is like tryin’ ter sell cabbages ter
a Chow.
“Well, I bumps old Shan th’ Goat up there.
’E’s wroughtin’ tli’ shells with Lovely Riley
—follerin’ th’ shows they was, like me an’
Chewey. There’s a terrible mob of spielers
out in th’ mulga this year. I bridges your
stiff ter old Shan, an’ ’e’s terrible tickled.
’E’s a eddicated bloke, y'know—being a
magsman ’e’s gotter be —an’ e’ garroples it
w’ile I ain’t thinkin’.
“W’en we gets ter one little E-flat place
a dooty-struck John roun’s up th’ ’ole damn
mob of magsmen on th’ crust,. an Shan s
trawled in with th’ bunch. Avm that still,
you sent me in ’is kick, addressed P. Perei-
val, Esquire,’ ’e gives ‘Percival’ as is moni-
ker. Well, all th’ talent’s in th’ peters at
th’ lockup, a monte for a drag . each or
p’raps a sixer—Sugar Donovan did cop a
sixer, but ’e ’ad a readied set of tats on im,
so all th’ Oscar Asche in th’ mint couldn t
save ’im —an’ w’en they frisked Shan after
Vd been shot in they sprung your letter.
About a hour after that th’ old frost-bitten
sergeant, a dead shrewd old bird, calls Shan
outer the peter.
“‘I see,’ ’e says, ‘you gotter letter ’ere
from th’ seketary of th’ Further Settlements
League,’ ’e says.
“ Too right,’ says Shan.
“ ‘Sir Peter McWliiffle an’ the Hon’able
’Ector Cummins is on th’ Board?’ says th’
sergeant.
“ ‘Yairs,’ says Shan, ‘they’re fr’en’s o’
mine.’
“ ‘Well,’ says the sergeant, ‘you seem ter
be follerin’ a honest livin’,’ ’e says, ‘so I’ll
give yer a benefit of th’ doubt,’ ’e says. ‘You
may go.’
“Y’see. all them toffs’ names printed on
your stiff ’ad ’tli Johns bluffed, an’ saved old
Shan’s life. W’en th’ sarge told ’im ’e
could p.0.q., you bet tli’ shadders of night
closed on ’im sudden! ’E come on with
Chewey an’ me after that. That’s tli’ best
of bein’ eddicated. Old Shan can spruik
like a gramophone. W’y, ’e calls playin’ tli’
shells —thimble an’ pea, y’ know —‘conk-
ology'! An’ ’e calls that kinder bluff ’e
put up oil tlr Johns ‘shy-collegey’—wot’s th’
strong of it?”
I endeavored to explain the true inward-
ness of psychology.
“Ah, yairs!” said Phil, “I’m a jerry.
Every showman and spieler—every bloke
livin’ on th’ game, from sellin’ schlenter
jool’ry ter spielin’ th’ broads —as’ gotter
know all about it. We calls’ it instink.
“You’ll see a bloke wroughtin’ th’ broads
or th’ shells, an’ you’ll be wingin’ to ’is mag.
’E never stops. ‘Next sport, ’oo know’s it
now, for a quid, a coupler quid or on’y ’arf
a dollar?’ ’e says. There’s a mob roun’ an’
’e’s graftin’ away with ’is little queen or
’is pea—though it ain’t a jonnick pea, on’y
a little kleiner ball made outer compersishun
—you’d swear ’e’s doin’ well. ’E ain’t,
though. ’E’s got two or three ramarees
graftin’ for ’im, an’ th’ rest of th’ mob’s
shrewd mugs an’ fly flats, ’oo’s no good to
Gundy or no one else.
“All at once you ’ear th’ bloke ’oo’s playin’
say, in th’ middle of ’is cackle, ‘Nex’ sport
’oo knows it now? Mick an’ Steve’s cornin',
’oo knows it?’ Now, ‘Mick an’ Steve’s’ th’
chat to th’ rams —wot you calls confed’rits—
th’ office, you unnerstan’ me, tellin’ ’em
there’s a bonzer mug cornin’ ’oo’s got silver.
You jus’ ’ave a screw, an’ inside five minnits
that mug’s lobbed orrite, an’ done all ’e’s got.
Tli’ bloke wroughtin’ never lifted ’is lamps
off th’ broads or th’ shells you’d think, but
’e sighted good old Mick an’ Steve a furlong
off. That’s shy-collegey.
“O’ course, I know nigh every spieler an
raagsman on th’ roads. Some of ’em s cob-
bers of mine—-I never take that lurk on me-
self; it’s off my pad—but they’ve all got
shy-collegey. An’, mind yer, theres this to
it: every mug ’oo comes at a tale. on th
broads, an’ all that, is a crook in his eart,
for ’e’s tryin’ ’isself ter take th’ magsman
down an’ get somethin’ for nothin’.
“Another thing. A showman like me
dresses a bit sporty now an’ then, but a
magsman don’t. ’E allers looks dead-square,
an’ as respeckterble as a undertaker cornin’
’ome from the boneyard. All that’s shy-
collegey.
“Well, as I was ehattin’ yer, Shan comes
on offsidin’ for Chewey Saunders’s snake-
show. They call ’im Chewey ’cause ’e’s a
Noah’s ark, an’ chews th’ rag, y’ know. ’E’s
a ’ard doer, too, but ’e’s allers got a coupler
bob.
“Shan ain’t gallied of the snakes, like I
am, an’ ’e’s a bonzer ram, too. Spruik?
’E can talk like a auctioneer in th’ ’orrors !
An’ ’e can put it over th’ toffs, too. One of
th’ ’ends of th’ Church of Englan’ come inter
our tent at Nyngan—a arclidinkum- —an’
Shan drums ’im about color-blind snakes, an’
deaf-adders, an’ deadly cobbers from Injia,
an’ all that, till you’d swear blin’ ’e knoo
somethin’ about it! ’E knows Latin, an’ all
that Dago stuff, too, better’ll a priest or a
chemist.
“But, of course, Shan th’ Goat, true ter
label, must get on th’ pongelo, an’ make a
sideshow of ’isself. We missed ’im all one
mornin’ at Wellington, an’ Chewey goes
lookin’ fer ’im. ’E found ’im, too, an’ lum-
bers ’im ’ome, lit up like th’ White Way.
’E dumps Shan inter the tent, an’ then starts
roarin’ me up ! Blime, I ain’t done nothin’.
‘I foun’ that false-alarm cobber o’ yours,’
’e says, ‘in th’ near-an’-far at Maguire’s
rubby-de-dub,’ ’e says, ‘an’ wotjer think th’
flamin’ impo. is doin’?’ ’e says.
“ ‘Sayin’ ’is prayers, p’raps,’ I says.
“ ‘Prayers be damned!’ says Chewey. ‘’E
’ad three of my best snakes in ’is shirt, an’
’e was buskin’ to a barful o’ tugs for beer!’
’e says. An’ then ’e opens up flooent, as yer
might say, an’ towels me up like a J.P.
finin’ a drunk.
“Old Shan’s dead to th’ wide lyin’ inside
th’ tent, an’, blime, w’en ’e does wake up
a hour or two later, ’e comes shadder-sparrin’
outside with a two-foot tiger-snake in ’is
dook, an’ swears blind it’s bit ’im on th’
nose w’ile ’e was asleep.
“ ‘That there tiger wouldn’t bite pussy,’
says Chewey, very indignant—‘ ’e’s th’
gentlest, affectionatest, good-naturedest snake
I got,’ ’e says. ‘ ’E’s slep’ in my dab with
me for munce an’ munce,’ ’e says, ‘an’ ’e
never bit me!’
“‘Look at me flamin’ bowsprit!’ roars
Shan. ‘Can’t yer see I’m dyin’?’
“ ’ls boko was barked a bit an’ swellin’
up rapid. Even w’en Shan’s shaved an’
sober ’is face ain’t much like a t’ilet-soap
shiela in a adver-tise-ment. It’s more of a
comic pannerammer than a oil-paintin’. ’E’s
got a beak on ’im wot sticks out like Wilson’s
Prommerterry, an’ it’s got all th’ warts an’
shiny red knobs of a turkey-gobbler’s chiv.
Shan’s dial ain’t so much a facp as a judg-
ment.
“Chewey says, ‘Well, if yer snout’s been
bit,’ ’e says, ‘yer muster done it yerself in
yer sleep.’
“But old Shan’s gettin’ desprit. ’E ’owls:
‘Strike me ’andsome, I’m dyin’! Can’t yer
jerry I’m blanky well snuffin’ out?’
“So Oliewey gets a ’ank of fishin’-line, an"
reckons ’e’ll ’ave ter tie a signature tight
roun’ Shan’s conk, an’ slosh it with a razor,
an’ then rub in Condy’s crystals.
“You ougliter ’eard Shan ! ’E goes crook-
er'n ever, an’ wot with tli’ boose an’ ’is boko
swellin’, ’e looks like Lizzie, th’ blood-
sweatin’ hipperpottermus wot useter be with
W irths’.
“Chewey forgot ter go crook as ’e looked
at ’im. All ’is showman’s instink —shy-
collegey—come up.
“ ‘ ’Struth!’ ’e says, ‘you’re a dead ring for
Rudolph, th’ pig-faced boy!’ ’e says, lorst in
admiration. ‘Strike a light!’ ’e says, ‘you
ain’t no good ter my show no more,’ ’e says;
‘th’ public ain’t goin’ ter pay a deener a
time ter see snakes an’ jew-lizards inside th’
tent w’en they can see a face like that
outside for nix,’ ’e says.
“But be now Shan’s near in a mish, shak-
in’ like a dice-box, an’ down on ’is marrer-
bones gabblin’ ’Ail Marys for th’ lick of ’is
life. Got th’ breeze up, ’e ’ad.
“So I gets th’ crokus to ’im an’ ’e says
Shan’s on’y bruised th’ cartridge of 'is
nose, proberbly by a fall, ’e says, an’ cops
’arf a quid for sayin’ it.
“So me an’ Shan slung Chewey’s joint
’an breaks back ter town. No more snakes
for me! I’m on th’ lookout for a Circasshun
beauty or a wart-’og, I don’t care w’ich.
Blime! Wot’s wrong with showin’ Shaitf
“Got time ter come out an’ stop one? No?
Well, so long!”
And Phil the Showman moved to the door.
As he let himself out he remarked with a
twinkle:
“Old Shan useter call ’is shell game ‘conk-
olpgy.’ Seems like that’s a better name for
’im ter use than ‘shy-collegey,’ don’t you
think?”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Taking the sun, the dark coal-lighters lean
Along the wooden wharves and waterways.
Like old, work-wearied nags that in some
green,
Sweet-flowered pasture spend their quiet
days. . /
Flacid with age they rub wet noses there.
But when the wind comes crying frorh the
sea
They whinny with delight, and snuff the air.
And tug their shameful fetters to be free.
Oh, galling peace! Oh, memories old with
pain !
The wild wind harries, and the driving
sleet!
Their bones are stirred with longings. Once
again
They feel the wide, white roads beneath
their feet!

Stewart Horns, both electric and hand-operated, respond instantly to the touch of the driver, and

no other horns provide for the motorist the same complete sense of security against the occurrence
of accidents or collisions.
The motor of the Stewart Electric Horn is made to stand years and years of use. Its large armature
provides greater power with less current. Diaphragm is made of high-grade specially treated steel.
Stewart Hand Horns can readily be attached to car or motor-cycle. The internal mechanism is so
arranged that one push of the plunger creates 1 92 distinct sound impulses: more than any other signal.

IF you have never driven in the CASE there s a
revelation of riding ease in store. The almost total
absence of noise, either from the motor of body
fittings, is akin to riding on velvet, and even when
travelling over roughest country the freedom from
road bumps is remarkable.
The CASE Model X is an ideal automobile for driving
in rough weather. With the storm curtains in place,
the comfort of an enclosed car is approached, so
snugly are they fitted. Supported by rigid standards,
they open with the doors ; then again, the refined
character of the upholstery, in seats, backs and fit-
tings, adds to the sense of comfort.
