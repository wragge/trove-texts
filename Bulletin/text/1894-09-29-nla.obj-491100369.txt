Contemporary Science.
The development of the theory of evolution, that grand conception which unites
all phenomena m one splendid synthesis under uniform law, remains the most attrac-
tive feature of contemporary science. From year to year the hypothesis is altered
in its details but its general truth becomes always clearer, and those who now reject
it do so only by impugning the quality of their intellect. It is not as if there were
rival theories of defensible validity. All the facts point one way. For creation or
emanation there are assumptions and presumptions innumerable, but not a vestige
of ponderable proof. For evolution there is all the proof that is. Its chain of evi-
dence may not be complete ; the links that are wanting have probably been lost for
e\er, but sufficient remain to amply justify the general judgment of scientists.
Sporadic objectors, like Lord Salisbury, doubtfully suggesting the argument for
design to the consideration of the British Association ; or Mrs. Besant, confidently
comparing the weakness of inductive logic with the sweet reasonableness sweated
rom the swoons of a Master-Mahatma, are mere retrograde ripples swallowed in the
advancing tide of thought. Lord Salisbury’s cavil that physicists and biologists
cannot agree as to time available and time demanded for the processes of
evolution, gives ground for believing that either physicists or biologists, or
both, are m error; but affords no basis for postulating supernatural inter-
ference with observed uniformity of natural law. Mrs. Besant’s quotation of
Weismann a " de “7 ln g perpetuation of acquired structural variations, and of
Huxley as admitting that ethical advance is opposed to the scheme of natural
selection, is a pleasant irrelevancy of the platform. Neither Weismann nor Huxley,
as Mrs. Besant might add at future lectures, has the least idea that the evolu-
tionary theory is weakened by their admissions. It is only modified. Weismann
simply shifts the load from natural selection to sexual selection; and Huxley, while
re-stating the truism that altruism is opposed to egoism, recognises as a matter of
course that both altruism and egoism join rhythmically in evolutionary unity.
The tendency of current thought is to show that the individual is in the plan
of existence as nothing compared with the race—that the most complex individual
lives are, in Fosters phrase, “ but the bye-play of ovum-bearing organisms.” Here
again evolution comes directly into conflict with Oriental creeds which lay stress on
the need for purification of the Ego by a short or long course of trial, with a view
to final salvation. More and more clearly is it to be seen that this view is un-
scientific and unwarrantable—the dear delusion of anthropocentric myths which
measure the Atom with the All, and hail him master of a universe where his function
is solely that of a life-bearer, and his identity is a matter of the profoundest cosmic
indifference.
In the “Contemporary Science Series,” a list of which appears below, may be
found the most recent and readable books on evolution, as on many other minor
phases of scientific struggle. Such works as Drummond’s “Ascent of Man ” and
Kidds Social Evolution,” written to bolster preconceived theories, cannot compare
m interest and value with a book like “The Evolution of Sex,” a most masterly
review of a wide and fascinating field. Weismann’s “Germ-Plasm” is strong meat
for begmners, and wants some previous training to be appreciated. Lombroso’s
•Man of Genius and Ellis’s “Criminal” and “Man and Woman” (elsewhere
noted) have special charm for average readers; but the whole series can be warmly
recommended. Posted for 3s. 9d. each, with exceptions noted.

A party of Condobolin shearers accom-
panied a mate, suffering from toothache, into a
saloon where teeth are pulled. When the colored
gemman who operates began work the shearer
howled loudly, whereupon Bill the Ringer ; “You
are a cocktail ! Just stop quiet a minute and
this man will soon fix you up. He’s a first-class
hand at drorin’ teeth. He’s drawn many a
hundred of mine.” And then (reflectively): “My
gory oath ! I haven’t hardly any left.”
i Labouchere professes to be unable to
understand how Robert Buchanan, a moralist
earning .£l5OO a year, can fall so heavily as to
have for his only assets in insolvency a few copy-
| rights. Labby and Buchanan have never made
■ up the historic squabble in which the former,
drenched with 17 vials of vituperation, remarked
that “ Mr. Buchanan came to me a hungry and
scrofulous Scotchman. I gave him meat for his
belly and sulphur for his back; and this is my
reward !”

A Monaro man has gained the belt as
champion gormandizer. One of his latest essays
was the consumption of 16 eggs, most of them
goose and turkey eggs, also a couple of loaves of
bread and three quarts of tea. He could have
eaten more but was cut short by the culinary
official, who objected on purely economic grounds.
It is unknown what amount of food he is capable
■ of devouring, as he has never been given a fair go ;
however, his admirers are so sanguine that he is
| invincible they are prepared to back their
“ gorger ” to consume more food, at a sitting, than
any man in Australia.
The hospital on one mining field was run
a bit differently in the early Seventies from what
it is now. There were only visiting-surgeons then,
the warder being the sole resident official. That
was Johnny B. Johnny mostly used to be “down
town ” on an afternoon and evening, and was
generally “tanglefooted ” when he got back. One
night he was in a particularly dogmatic humour,
and, as he went his rounds, made some comforting
remark to each patient. Presently he came to
one whose early demise was a certainty. “Well,”
said Johnny, reflectively, “ not dead yet! Why,
in the Yale of Hinnom, can’t you—hie—die
decently in the daytime ? Here you’ll go slippin’
it in the' middle of the night and in the mornin’
it’ll be—hie —perfect Sheol to straighten you out!”

Professor TODD, Anderson’s College Medical
School, Glasgow, in an entirely voluntary com-
munication on his part to Messrs. Bosisto & Co.,
writes :
It is a lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy
nauseous odour characteristic of others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, which places
it above other preparations, and considerably enhances its
value.

N.S.W. Premier Reid’s pronouncement of
January last that “Single-tax is robbery ” stands
like a rod in pickle and will fall on his back at an
early date.
A commercial estimate of the respective
benefits derived or to be derived by N.S.W. from
the Philadelphia and Chicago Exhibitions places
the former in the front. Yet Philadelphia cost
N.S.W. ,£3000 only, whereas Chicago stood her
£28,924.
Lamentation of a N.S. ■/. political Jere-
miah : —“As long as I wore the garb of an Ishmael
and proclaimed myself a vagabond my constituents
sent me into Parliament; but as soon as I took a
regular bath and endeavoured to be a respectable
member of society they kicked me out.”
The labor-vessel May touched lately at
Tucopra, an island 150 miles east of Santa Cruz.
As neither traders nor missionaries had hitherto
touched there the people were fairly prosperous,
peaceable and increasing in numbers. The captain
reports that he found there a race of giants, 6ft.
high with hair about 18in. long. He asserts also
that the natives actually didn't want to go to
Queensland. The latter statement, however,
gives away the captain and brands him as a
Munchausen of the first water.
St. James’ Gazette (London) publishes
a beautiful photo, of the cow on whose milk the
York baby is being fed. Presumably the pro-
prietors of the crawlsome print understand the
tastes of their degraded customers, and know that
a picture of the cow on whose milk the York baby
is fed will be a matter of interest, and will help to
boom the sale of the paper. Moreover, the por-
trait of the cow helps to maintain the spirit of
loyalty, and loyalty is the silken bond which
keeps the empire together. Therefore, the Gazette,
as a loyal publication, is wise in its crawling day
and generation, for in these revolutionary times
the royal fetish wants all the support it can get,
and even an engraving of the lank and dismal
bovine which furnishes nutriment to Victoria’s
toothless descendant is a buttress to the Throne
and another barrier against the inroads of Demo-
cracy.

The policeman’s foot, it seems, is not a
joke, after all, but a scientific reality. An Eng-
lish journalist who has interviewed sundry police-
men on the subject reports : —
It is a fact —but heretofore unohronicled —that the size
of a policeman’s foot increases according to his time of
service. A policeman who wears a No. 9 shoe when he
goes on the force has to replace it with a No. 10 after a
year’s pedestrian exercise, with a No. 10J or 11 after two
years, and with a 11J or 12 after three years' active em-
ployment. Just why this is true is a matter for scientific
investigation, worthy of a special article for one of the
heavy monthly periodicals and entirely too abstruse for
consideration’in a sketch designed for newspaper
readers. Whether constant walking has a tendency to
spread out the foot or not must be determined by some
specialist in pedal extremities, whose attention is here-
with directed to a new field of theoretical research. It is
sufficient for the present that policemen, as a rule, do not
have shapely feet. After a few months’ service the aris-
tocratic high instep disappears, the arch is annihilated,
and that tapering toward the toes which is so effective
when the foot is shod in a patent-leather shoe is gone for-
ever. The foot becomes as flat as a pancake, and tracks
left in the mud by an old time policeman look like the
footprints of a full grown elephant.
The successful removal of Piles of the
most stubborn description is being effected by
Sharp’s new “Cannalin” treatment, large quan-
tities of which are being forwarded to sufferers
throughout the colonies. It is obtainable, with
advice, from 257 George-street, Sydney.

The Absentee Problem.
Australia is, above all other countries,
civilised and uncivilised, the land of the
absentee. He dates almost from the first
beginnings of its history, and has multiplied
with dreadful persistence ever since. He is
a curse which accumulates, and is still accu-
mulating, at compound interest. The trou-
ble began in the early days with the granting
of large tracts of land to influential settlers,
either gratis or for merely nominal prices,
with a view to creating what was termed an
“influx of population.” The experiment
looked sufficiently feasible, but the end of it
was disastrous. The owners of most of
the large giants which still remain intact,
or nearly intact, now reside in Eng-
land. Their lands have been made valuable
by the growth of a community which they
did little or nothing to assist and encourage;
and because of this Australia pays to them
in rent—which rent is expended in England
—about two thousand per cent, per
annum on their original investment. Other
grants have been sold at several dozen—
or several hundred times their first
cost (assuming that there was any first
cost, which was not always the case); in other
words, Australia bought back, at an enor-
mous price, what it had originally given
away almost for nothing. Sometimes the
seller took the money to England ; some-
times he invested it in Australia and it piled
up unearned increment and brought in—and
still brings in—steadily increasing rentals
thatgo the way of most of Australia’s wealth—-
towards England. This country’s account
with a good many of its grand old pioneers
stands thus : It gave them, or sold them for
a few hundred pounds, a vast estate which
they did practically nothing to improve. It
made the estate valuable, and because of this
it had to buy back the property for many
thousands. And then the thousands were
invested in urban lands, and a city was built
up round them, and they multiplied in value,
and Australia pays thousands annually now,
and will pay more thousands annually in the
future, and is pledged to keep on paying
them for ever and ever, to a British absentee,
merely because, years ago, he was a forlorn
stranger and this country took him in.
* * *
When the gold-era came the absentee
curse became great and terrible. An im-
mense percentage of the gold—that part of
it which probably did Australia the least
harm—was carried away to England almost
as soon as found. A lot more remained as
the invested capital of absentees. Victoria,
during its brief history, has produced nearly
£240,000,000 worth of the yellow metal, and
yet the whole wealth of the province, apart
from its unimproved land values—everything
that its population has accumulated in the
shape of buildings, improvements of all
kinds, portable property of every description,
shipping, railways, and the like—hardly
amounts to more than £340,000,000. And
these assets are mortgaged to England for
over £100,000,000, reckoning public and
private liabilities. So that the whole wealth
of Victoria hardly equals what it has gained
from the gold industry alone ; for fifty years
of patient toil in pastoral, agricultural and
manufacturing pursuits there is nothing what-
ever to show, for the absentee has taken it all.
And the experience of Victoria has been, in a
greater or less degree, the experience of all
Australia. The story of one typical pioneer
is worth quoting here by way of illustration.
In the latter “ fifties ” a penniless English
emigrant landed in Victoria, and by good
luck made, within a year, a reasonable for-
tune among the gullies of Bendigo. Unlike
most of the lucky pioneers who survived the
rum and frenzy of these days, he did not
carry his entire fortune away with him, but
invested a small part of it in a block of land
on what was then the outskirts of Melbourne.
Then he went “ Home ” and never returned,
but without his assistance the city grew and
swallowed up his patch of soil, and it was let
on building-leases which were renewed at
steadily increasing rentals, until Victoria
now pays him, or his descendants or repre-
sentatives, some £25,000 a year, merely
because he troubled the country with his
presence for a few months some 40 years
ago. By-and-bye it will pay him £50,000 a
year ; then, later on, the burden will in-
crease to £lOO,OOO, and will still keep on
increasing. Thus the evil which he, and all
others of his kind, did lives after them, and
Australia must keep for ever paying interest
on its own wealth, till at last its gold makes
it the poorest country on this earth.
• • •
The same curse is still working. The men
who made great fortunes out of Mt. Morgan
and Broken Hill have mostly gone to spend
them in England. Some of them took their
pile with them ; others invested much of it
in Australia, and this country will pay interest
on its own gold and silver until it is paid
and sent to England twenty times over, and
yet is still owing, and must be paid twenty
or a hundred times more. The men who
are making great fortunes on the Westralian
goldfields will probably go to England in
their turn. When they go they will most
likely own among them a very large pro-
portion of the lands on which the towns of
the new goldfields are built, and because of
the gold which is dug out of the earth and
mostly sent to England these towns will
increase, and rents will go up enormously,
and a large percentage of the rents will like-
wise go to the absentee-owners in England,
till at last Coolgardie and the Murchison
make Australia poorer than it was before,
just as many other goldfields have done.
• • «
Even this, however, is only the outer
fringe of the evil. A little while ago
the Westralian Government sold a good-
sized province to an English company,
the famous Hampton Plains syndicate,
at 2s. 6d. an acre, and gave it also the
option of buying one or two more provinces
at the same rate. The land has since proved
to be auriferous, and Australia will, in the
future, probably have to pay rent to another
incorporated British absentee, at the rate of
a hundred, or several hundreds, per cent,
per annum. Sixty years ago an even worse
monopoly was created in South Australia,
and endures unto this day. Sundry bene-
volent English gentlemen obtained a grant
of many fertile miles of land in that pro-
vince, under the solemn assurance that their
object was solely to encourage settlement.
South Australia has paid, since then,
something like a million-and-a half in
rentals to these same kindly absentees
—who are now famous as about the hardest
rack-renters in the province—and has no
prospect of getting rid of them through all
futurity. The land - grant railways now
building in W.A., and those to be built in
Queensland, will create more absentee land-
lords, and how much they will ultimately
cost in rentals—all of which must go to
England—is beyond estimate, for the possi-
bilities are all but illimitable. When the
Colo Valley electric-lighting monopoly is
confirmed by New South Wales Parliament,
it will also be floated in London, and then
the money which Sydney and the surround-
ing towns pay for lighting and motive power
will likewise go to the inevitable country
from which none of Australia’s legal tender
ever returns. Everything that is valuable in
Australia goes the same road, and gets,
sooner or later, to the same destination.
* * *
Of the so-called Australian banks four are
English institutions. These rendered Aus-
tralia the questionable benefit of introducing,
years ago, a certain amount of capital, and
have ground out of this country dividends
ranging from six to thirty per cent, in
return. The capital introduced has already
been repaid probably twice over, and it will
go on being repaid and still being owed
indefinitely. The shares of most of the
purely Australian banks—as they are com-
monly described—are also largely held in
London, and they also are, to a great extent,
mere machines for grinding out dividends
for British capitalits. About two dozen
English loan, mortgage and finance com-
panies trade in Australia, and carry away
some hundreds of thousands annually
to pay divdends in England. Nearly
'fifty English fire insurance companies
likewise infest this country, and take
out of it something like £lOO,OOO per
annum in profits, giving nothing in return.
Many millions of British capital have come
here in the shape of deposits and debenture
money, and the interest which they earn also
departs never to be seen again. Many of the
big importing firms are merely agencies for
British houses ; the profits they realise go to
England, and the deluded inhabitants of
New South Wales adhere to a Freetrade
policy, in order that these profits may not be
diminished or unduly interfered with by the
competition of local manufacturers. And, as
the result of it all, Australasia—which, by
reason of its gold and silver and its great
areas of virgin soil, should have been the
richest land on earth—has always been so
poor that nearly all the money necessary for
railway construction and other public works
had to be borrowed—much of it at exorbi-
tant interest—from the same universal
pawnbroker. The seven provinces now
owe the British money-lender about
£210,000,000 of public loans, and some-
where approaching £300,000,000 in debts
due to private creditors and miscel-
laneous absentees. The total annual
tribute which Australia pays to the British
usurer, for interest on money lent, rental of
lands exploited, and profits to commercial
adventurers, is unascertainable, but it is pro-
bably not less than £20,000,000 annually, or
about £5 per year for each inhabitant.
# # •
The public debt of over two hundred mil-
lions may fairly be charged, in part, at least,
to extravagance and incapacity, but it alone
is a burden which could be borne with
safety and comparative ease. The real causes
of this country’s impoverishment are the
British commercial exploiters, company-pro-
moters, syndicators, and private money-
lenders, the British adventurers who made
fortunes in Australia, and invested them at
usury and then went “Home” to be a
burden on this country for ever afterwards,
and the unpatriotic Australians who draw
rents and dividends out of their native land
and spend them in Europe and elsewhere.
No other State has grown up under like con-
ditions, for the art of finance, in its com-
plete and beautiful developments, is a thing
of very recent date, and Australia, as the
latest born of the nations, is the only one
which has had the shadow of foreign usury
over it from its cradle. Therefore there is
no exactly similar case in history to show
what the end is to be. But, by all present
appearances the end —unless some kind of
legislation can be devised for the extinction
of absenteeism in all its worst forms—must
be insolvency. The tribute which Australia
pays to its multitudinous British creditors is
as utterly lost to the community as if it were
annually sunk in the ocean. The country
does not raise enough surplus gold to pay
interest on the universal mortgage, so it
lives mainly on the influx of more and still
more foreign capital—in other words, it
lives by adding to its burdens and making
its condition worse than it was before. No
Australasian Government, save that of Maori-
land, has even attempted to face the pro-
blem, and Maoriland is apparently beginning
to discover that the problem is almost too
much for it. Australia will presently make
the same discovery, and, after that .
Annie Besant: a Theory.
To many people Annie Besant is a puzzle, a
paradox. They contrast the creed she has left
with the creed she has joined, neo-Materialism
with neo-Theosophy ; and they see that the two
are absolutely antagonistic, mutually exclusive.
Yet here is a woman who passes from one to the
other “ somewhat suddenly,” in Bradlauqh’s
weighed and guarded phrase ; almost without a
struggle, as it appears to others. In a moment
she literally turns her mind upside-down,
astounding friends by the ease with which she
quits long-cherished convictions, and becoming
immediately no ■ less ardent and obstinate a
champion of her new faith than she was of her
old. The fruits of 20 years of strenuous thought
melt in a single glance from the “brilliant
eyes” of Madame Blavatsky. Admitting
her honesty, her sanity, how possibly
account for a revolution so radical ? But
consider. The very violence of the contradic-
tion between Annie Besant the Materialist and
Annie Besant the Theosophist implies a close
bond of unity. For it is of the essence of
things that likeness breeds opposition, unlike-
ness apposition. Extremes meet, complexity
is nearest simplicity ; and the universe rings
with the chime of contraries. Perchance our
paradox may sit on the inmost verge of
harmony.
• # •
This much is certain : the factors of the
problem are simply the every-day factors of
action and re action between organism and
environment. In the mental world, as i Q
the physical, there is no escape from
the scientific law of necessity. Effect every,
where follows cause; and with a sufficient
knowledge of principles and conditions we can
easily trace either for the finite distance corres-
ponding with finite capacity. Mrs. Besant
acted as she did act simply because, being what
she was, subject to the particular set of i n .
fluences to which she was subject, she could
not possibly act otherwise. The reasons f o p
her conduct lie firstly in herself, secondly ffi
her circumstances; and there is no room f or
any other reasons whatever. Study of her lif Q
should furnish the key to her character. Now
her mental life has experienced two great
crises: her conversion from Materialism to
Theosophy, and her previous conversion from
Christianity to Materialism. Mrs. Besant’s
autobiography and other sources of information
yield a wide induction of facts; and, applyi n „
deductively conclusions gained in other fields
of enquiry, a theory leaps at once to light. The
argument naturally takes syllogistic form.
* * #
Here is the major. The bent of man is
intellectual; the bent of woman is emotional.
This is a familiar philosophic statement justified
by a large number of special sex-observations
and supported by common experience. E x .
ceptions are sufficiently explained on the ground
of hermaphroditic race-ancestry; and Weis-
mann, the German naturalist whose thought
and experiments are doing so much to mould
current science, believes that the elements of
both sexes are in every individual, the one class
active, the other passive. Occasionally the
predominance is not marked, and primary
characters of one sex accompany secondary
characters of the other in the same individual.
Naturally, sex-generalisations apply particularly
to those individuals in whom sex is most pro-
minent, and in a less degree to those gathered
closer to the median line of difference. But,
generally speaking, though in savagery the
sexes seem almost equally superstitious, as
civilisation advances the domain of faith becomes
more and more clearly that of woman, and the
domain of reason that of man. Women are every-
where the willing supporters of clericalism,
long after men have emancipated themselves
from its sway. They judge intuitively rather
than rationally, arguing to what they wish to
be rather than from what is. In popular
language, they are ruled, not by their brains,
but by their hearts.
* * *
Annie Besant is essentially a womanly
woman. She would not wear men’s clothes,
like George Sand ; or in her own person defy
conventional morality, like George Eliot with
Lewes. (The defence of the Knowlton pamph-
let was a matter of principle which her feminine
conscience justified.) Mrs. Besant’s muliebrity
is shown in a hundred things which we are
used to consider manifestations of sex. She
has been wife and mother ; she is constitution-
ally anabolic, with rounded contours and small
bones, needing slight nourishment; she is not
above little coquetries of dressor little vanities of
nature —as, for instance, in being always photo-
graphed full-face because her profile is not
effective ; “ her voice was ever soft, gentle, and
low—an excellent thing in woman ; ” she is
tenacious of life—she suffered more and longer
than Bradlaugh, yet Bradlaugh is dead and
she is alive and well, probably partly because
he was man and she woman ; she is an inter-
preter, not a creator; she has the feminine
quality of receptivity in a very high degree,
and the masculine quality of originality in a
very low degree—Constance Naden, who had
both, died young, and Mrs. Besant should
live to be 90, though nothing she has written
will remain, and some things that Miss Naden
w'rote are imperishable, for of such is the law of
compensations. Add to this that, throughout
her life—as a school-girl, praying to a sensuous
Christ ; as a mother, fighting with Death for
her child ; as a friend, faithful to the end to
Charles Bradlaugh ; as a thinker, yearning
for some fixed basis of faith, some definite hope
of immortality—Mrs. Besant has exemplified
always the altruistic woman, a vessel of love
and devotion, never the egoistic man ; and our
minor premiss may fairly stand as established.
* 9 *
The conclusion comes of itself. Mrs. Besant
is ruled by her emotions, not by her intellect,
keen though it be. Her 16 years of Materialism
were 16 years of error, 16 years of wandering
from her proper path, 16 years in which her
real nature lay fettered and dormant. Only
now is she on her true line, is she herself. The
mystic promises of Theosophy satisfy her
latent longings as the hard facts of Materialism
never could satisfy them. Her intellect protests
feebly, but is over-ruled. She admits that her
belief in Theosophy is only partly a matter of in-
tellectual conviction. Nevertheless, she believes
wholly, because belief is a necessity of her nature.
All similar emotional characters make a similar
choice. No half-measures are possible to them.
Cardinal Newman, confronted with the dilemma,
“ Absolute Rome or absolute reason,” after an
agonised struggle chose Rome, because his
emotions dominated his intellect. His brother
chose reason, because his intellect dominated
his emotions. Once made, the characteristic
choice is final; and, as in both Cardinal New-
man and Annie Besant, the intellect is set to
work to justify the dogmas against which it
fought. The process is curious, but perfectly
intelligible ; since it is essential to the peace of
the ruling mental force-majority that the
demon Doubt be excluded from the citadel of
the Ego.
m m m
In Mrs. Besant’s case, the years which the
materialistic locust hath eaten are easily
accounted for. On the threshold of woman-
hood she made a most unhappy marriage
with a clergyman who treated her cruelly,
the consequences of which, in mental distress
and physical illness which all but killed her,
accentuated her previous sense of the weakness
of the Christian religion, and for a time com-
pletely subverted her nature. Had she married
a man whom she could love and respect, she
would have merged her views in his, sacrificed
her individuality to his welfare, and lost her
cavils in the glow of a deeper, but still


orthodox faith. It is directly to her misery
that wo owe Mrs. Besant’s magnificent life-
work. The tortured heart re-acted through
the burning brain. Yet the eclipse of her
inner self would have been but temporary had
she not met Charles Bradlaugh. His in-
fluence confirmed the new bias so decisively
that long years passed before it was gradually
lost. Only when Mrs. Besant had passed
middle age did she begin to feel lonely in her
cold, unconsolatory atheism. The longing for
human sympathy, besetting almost all men and
women after youth has vanished, became in her
an irresistible craving which mere philanthropic
work was unable to satisfy. Her heart regained
its supremacy, and cried loudly for a warmer
faith. Comte’s “ religion of humanity ” could
not suffice a character abhorrent of compromise.
From unbelief she passed at a bound to belief.
Yet her conversion to Theosophy, though it
appeared sudden, was not the expression of a
sudden change. It was preceded by a growing
conviction that the materialistic philosophy
was insufficient, and by the significant espousal
of Socialism —as compared with Individualism,
a more altruistic, more feminine, more emo-
tional creed. And at last Annie Besant’s life-
stream, long diverted, took its natural course.
• • «
Mrs. Besant wishes to deserve this epitaph :
“ She tried to follow Truth.” She has deserved
it. That the element of truth in Theosophy is
overlaid with much fantastic error matters
little. It is all truth to her, and the grandeur
of her nature glorifies her trivial creed. In
effect, the intellectual belief of a good woman
is of comparatively slight importance. We do
not seek to describe the colour of a flower
before enjoying its beauty or its fragrance.
Heroic souls like Annie Besant, with all their
frailties, are the salt of humanity. They are
linked indissolubly with every generous deed,
with every noble aspiration. They give
courage in the present, and hope for the
future. And here, on this bank and shoal of
time of which alone there is any certitude, we
are proud to yield them honor, whether our
destiny be divinity or dust.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Party Government in Maoriland
There are already certain signs and omens
which portend that Government by Contradic-
tion may yet cause the downfall of the Liberal
Government in Maoriland. The Ministry came
into power with an enormous majority—a
majority so large that, so far as the Lower
House was concerned, it could pass almost any
measures it chose. Premier Ballance, fortu-
nately, was not intoxicated by so much autho-
rity, and never in any way abused it. But
Seddon, who has inherited his predecessor’s
majority, has a tendency to drive his followers
much too hard, and there are already symptoms
of revolt. Minister M‘Kenzie’s insane Libel
Bill, which provides that every newspaper-writer
shall append his full name and address to all
his articles —a measure which is commonly
believed to have its origin in M'Kenzie’s desire
to lay the large red hand of identification on
his own personal critics —is the worst of various
small and irritating follies which the Seddon
Cabinet has lately committed. The House would
gladly throw it out, but under the clumsy system
of Party Government, it is impossible to do it
without a serious risk of throwing out the Liberal
Ministry altogether. Therefore, the choice
lies between swallowing the Seddon policy
whole or else putting the Conservative party in
power, and the Maoriland Conservative party
is probably the most widely-hated political
combination in Australasia. There is practi-
cally no alternative between these two ex-
tremes ; the party system is based on the
principle that the Legislature must exercise no
power of discrimination, but must accept the
policy of the Government in its entirety, or
else put its opponents in power and accept
their policy in its entirety instead. Therefore,
Maoriland will put up with the small follies of
the Seddon Cabinet as best it can until, at last,
in a sudden burst of aggravation, it will pro-
bably go back on its Liberalism for a time, and
help a Conservative reaction. The House
would gladly point out to Seddon that his
manners are not all that can be desired, and
that his colleague, M'Kenzie, is a clumsy per-
son of the bull-in-a-china-shop description, and
it would very much like to make some serious
alterations in Ward’s latest budget; but it can’t
do these things without endangering all that has
been gained since Ballance first came into
power, so it endures Seddon and M‘Kenzie as
best it can. If it could give them notice to quit
without thereby bursting up its entire Demo-
cratic policy it would probably do so, but the
system of Government by Contradiction forbids.
The fact that the greatest progressive move-
ment ever initiated in Australasia should come,
by a pure accident, to depend on the coarse and
aggressive ex-publican’s retention of his billet is
a strange anomaly, but the constitution is full
of such anomalies. No one ever knows in
politics what kind of character the best cause
may ultimately depend on.
The Land Resumption Dodge.
The little strip of land in Lavender Bay
(Sydney) resumed for the construction of the
Milson’s Point railway has cost the State
.£4:0,000. The area is just over six acres, so the
price is .£6500 per acre, or .£3OO per foot front-
age. Richardson and Wrench’s valuation,
about two years ago, was .£27,000, and the
decline in prices since then has probably brought
the market value down below <£20,000. Evi-
dently the poor old Treasury has been badly
got at, as it always is. Under the present
system, too, there is absolutely no means of
preventing the Treasury being got at. Taking
it all round, the State, when it buys land for
public purposes, pays twice or three times as
much for it as does anybody else. This is one
of the places where a land-tax, run on the
Maoriland system, would come in. Let every-
body be allowed to value his own land, the
State reserving—and freely exercising in cases
of attempted grab—the right to take the land
at the owner’s valuation and sell or lease it for
* u ‘* kanofi*-. nf the revenue. Then, when Govern-
ment wants to resume a patch of ground for any
purpose the owner will get the price which
he put upon it for taxation purposes, and no
more. With such a law as this, and an efficient
Betterment Act, New South Wales, Victoria,
and S.A. could even now begin building rail-
ways out of revenue, and the cost on which
interest would require to be paid would be so
small compared with that under the old system
that the lines could be made profitable in
many places where they would otherwise be
absolutely bankrupt. Of the many millions
which have already been spent in railroad con-
struction throughout Australia probably half
might have been saved if an equitable policy
had been adopted from the beginning, ami then
the railways would have been a splendid asset
instead of being, as they practically are, a
liability. But more than 90 per cent, of the
railway system is still to be built, so there is
time to save many more millions and tens of
millions by an immediate adoption of entirely
new principles.
The Rising of Young Victoria.
A few weeks ago The Bulletin, believing
Victoria to be still unready for an outbreak of
popular feeling, predicted that a dissolution of
its Pattersonian Parliament would result in a
reinstatement of nearly all the old members,
whilst the country went on “ sneering feebly as
before.” The prediction has been falsified con-
siderably. and falsified even more in spirit than
in fact. With the announcement of a general
election there came a sudden change in the Vic-
torian public demeanor : an unexpected anima-
tion, a healthy desire to improve the character
of the national Assembly as far as circumstances
would permit, and a noticeable eagerness on
the part of younger voters to nip Patterson’s
freetrade design in the bud. The result was a
return of 31 new members, including an addi-
tion of five to the previous Labor party and the
defeat of three very old-established calamities
in Tom Bent, Bryan O’Loghlen and L. L.
Smith. Of Bent and his political allies The
Bulletin once said that Victoria was waiting
for them to be dead. Well, Bent is now utterly
defunct, nor are the other two gentlemen likely
to achieve a resurrection. Young Victoria,
whose power increases every year, has recorded
an opinion of Bent and Co. for the first time,
and in that opinion there is hope for the future.
Meanwhile, the overthrow of Patterson is a
subject for rejoicing, not so much because any
new Government must necessarily be less
disastrous than the Government that was
smashed to atoms last Thursday, as on account
of the financial policy which was then placed at
the coming Premier’s disposal. An analysis of
candidates’“ views” and promises reveals the
fact that Victoria voted in the first place for
land taxation. George Turner professed to
be waiting for the country’s instructions as to
getting rid of the deficit that Patterson was
afraid to touch. The country has instructed
lawyer Turner. Thirty-five, or more, of the
elected candidates are definitely pledged
to advocate a tax upon unimproved land
values, and another nineteen members have
undertaken to support a bill to that effect.
Against these 50 to 60 adherents of the
land-tax cause there are not 15 sworn
opponents of the principle. The balance of the
Legislature promised nothing in particular
except to shift Patterson. He will be shifted
as per general desire. The Castlemaine bully
stood between capital and the direct tax-
gatherer, and possibly George Turner would
have taken up a similar position if the elections
had turned upon the rival merits of Ministerial
and Opposition policies. But the result of the
poll had very little to do with Turner, other
than as the representative chucker - out of
Patterson, and it had still less to do with
Turner’s nondescript policy. Sixty-six Op-
positionists were returned for the reason, in
almost all cases, that they spoke up for Protec-
tion, and favoured any scheme of direct taxation
which gets money from w here money should come.
Income-tax, property-tax, absentee-tax, wealth-
tax, “ surplus ’’-tax, “direct wealth ’’-tax, and
a progressive land-tax were each and all of
them supported by victorious candidates—a few
candidates being in favour of every kind of
direct tax that their constituents could put a
name to. But the only tax which secured a
strong working majority in the new Parliament
was the tax on unimproved land values. If
Premier Turner chooses to bill that desirable
impost at once, whilst the eye of the country is
fixed upon the matter, it must pass. If he
dodges his responsibility for the sake of banks,
squatters, mortgagors, building societies, &c.,
the wrath of the people will overtake him pre-
sently. Young Victoria has begun to take an
interest in politics, and the doctrine that sena-
tors ought to run straight is being preached by
the rising generation to its boom-tainted parent.
Melbourne’s four daily newspapers were fully
agreed upon one election matter. Each of
them advocated, frankly or by innuendo, the
dismissal of Tom Bent from Parliament. Each
had its mean, contemptible reasons for not
attacking, even if it didn’t champion, many
another candidate who deserved an all-round
“ doing,” but Bent, the Speaker, whose defeat
by a rival Tory could make very little differ-
ence in a “ party ” sense, was the one man they
all objected to on “ public grounds.” Their
refreshing unanimity in publishing three suc-
cessive Bent scandals —the Mercantile Finance
bills story, the parsonic proclamation of Bent’s
“ unfitness to represent any constituency,” and
the damaging ex-parte narrative of how Bent
transferred .£40,000 liability to a day-laborer at
the “alleged” price of 10s.—seemed to justify
a pretty general suspicion that even Patterson
and Co. were quite prepared to see the back of
burly old Tom. The little Standard, which for
all election purposes represented Patterson
body and soul, gloated over each new revela-
tion instead of sup-pressing it, so that Bent,
seeing his name large-typed in his former pal’s
own particular rag, probably knocked his head
against a wall and would have cried, “ Et tu,
Brute ! ” if he had understood the meaning of
that ancient quotation.
— «,
The Queensland Peace Preservation Bill,
although it has passed both Houses, is in a
rather curious situation. While the discussion
was in progress the Speaker suspended for a
week seven Labor members, and during the
period of their suspension the measure was
rushed through the Assembly. Now, it is
asserted, on high legal authority, that the sus-
pensions are altogether unlawful, having been
effected by the Chair on its own sole authority
and not by vote of the House. The Labor
members propose to try the point, and if they
win, and it is decided that their ejection was
unlawful, they will next raise the question
whether the acts of the House done in their
absence are, or are not, null and void. The
common-sense view of the question is that
they are, for otherwise a biassed Speaker could
get anything passed by simply suspending all
opponents ; and, in that case, the Peace Pre-
servation Bill is of no account whatever. In
the meantime the Opposition has petitioned the
Governor to withhold his assent to the Bill
until it is decided whether there is, in a legal
sense, any bill at all to be assented to. A truly
beautiful complication.
There are occasional signs, especially in the
correspondence columns of the daily papers, of
an agitation for a dividend-tax in New South
Wales. A dividend-tax is an impost which
would take so much per cent, from the profits
of banking, trading, mining, insurance, land,
and other companies, while it wouldn’t even
touch the private capitalist who trades, or
mines, or land-swindles on his own private
account and annexes his profits without the
empty formality of declaring a dividend.
The dividend-tax would get at that joint-
stock pawnshop, the Sydney Mont de Piet6,
which lends money at 40 per cent, or
under, while it would pass by pawnbroker
Mosenstein, who charges 100 per shent and
works on his own private account. It would
get at the struggling building society while it
would miss Sydney Burdekin, and it would
levy on the Australian Star and Daily Tele-
graph (and Bulletin) and leave the Herald
and Evening News untouched. It is not a
dividend-tax that the country wants, but an
income, land and absentee tax. And though it
wants the two former badly enough, it wants
the absentee-tax about 150 times worse.
J. M. Cross, the democratic member for Cler-
mont, has a Dill before the Queensland Assembly
providing that any person lending money on
real or personal property shall have no security
outside that property itself. At present —
though very few people are aware of the fact —■
the person who lends on mortgage has not only
the right to sell the property specifically
mortgaged in order to recover his money, but
if it does not realise the required amount he
can pursue his debtor at law for the balance,
and sell him up to the uttermost farthing if
necessary. Therefore, the person who borrows
money on the security of his house or land un-
consciously mortgages not only them but every-
thing else which lie possesses, including his bed
and his wardrobe and all his other belongings.
Further, when the original borrower sells the
property he does not get rid of the original
liability. He may sell his farm subject to the
mortgage, the mortgagee consenting to the
transfer, and the buyer may sell it again, and it
may pass through 20 different hands before any
trouble arises. But if the last holder fails to
pay, and the property does not realise the
amount of the loan, the original borrower of,
perhaps, a dozen years before can still
be sold up for the balance. The per-
son who signs the original promise to pay is
responsible to the bitter end. This cruel in-
justice has hitherto attracted little attention,
because, owing to the steady rise in property
values, the mortgagee has generally got his
pound of flesh without any difficulty. But the
recent fall in prices has made his security, in
hundreds of cases, worth less than the amount
of the advance, and as a consequence the
original borrower, in the comparatively few'
instances where he is still solvent, is having a
bad time of it. An immediate reform in the
law relating to mortgages is much wanted.
Re Haynes’s proposal to abolish capital
punishment and legal torture in New South
Wales that wild, whirling, ungrammatical
person, Benbow Q. Scalplock, of Bathurst
National Advocate, speaks :
Sympathy with crime is one of the most awful evi-
dences of a nation’s retrogression ; and this sympathy
is so much shown in Australia that it sometimes causes
thoughtful men to tremble for the race’s future. In no
other part of the world is murder so prevalent, serious
crime so common, property and liberty so little respected.
With only 4,000,000 of a population hardly a single week
passes by without our having to read of a double or triple
murder, of a ghastly doing to death by father, mother,
or sweetheart, of a brutal outrage on a helpless woman,
or of a shocking offence against the purity and innocence
of a little child. Crime is rampant. . . . The rope
and lash are the necessary means for avenging the victims
of certain brutal crimes, which mere incarceration in no
way provides against. And instead of the offences being
lessened in number which come under the extreme
remedies of law, they should be increased, and increased
again until criminality is finally choked out of existence
by the great fear of those who are criminally inclined.
The Bulletin hereby draws the attention of
the hysterical Scalplock to the fact that Aus-
tralia is not the most criminal part of the globe;
it comes on the list of civilised states some
distance behind France, Prussia, Saxony, most
of the other German states, Italy, Sweden, and
an enormous distance behind the United States.
Also, it has fewer murders in proportion to
population than France, Austria, Hungary,
Italy, Spain, the U.S., and about two dozen
other countries. Further, crime is diminishing,
rather than increasing, in proportion to popu-
lation ; and, in any case, the man who talks
about “ choking crime out of existence ” is an
ignoramus. Even in the days when 2000
persons were executed yearly in England crime
wasn’t “ choked.” Australia has little to boast
of in the matter of criminality, but it can’t be
improved by the frantic assertions of the
National Advocate, or the bloodstained
frenzy of Brother Scalplock, as he wades
through gore and bathos and figurative muddle-
ment, and winds up with a horrid cry for more
blood and lashes.
Judge Williams, enlarging upon the prepos-
terous cost of Vic. railway lines under
Speight’s management, seems to have over-
looked one vital point in the evidence.
Speight, having received a corrupt Legisla-
ture’s order to buy the land necessary for a
new line, was quite at the mercy of the
vendors. In 29 of the “ worst cases,” as his
counsel piit it, Speight went to arbitration,
and in 27 out of the 29 cases the arbitrators
decided that the Railway Department had not
offered enough to the landowners. “In those
cases the Commissioners had to pay costs on
both sides amounting to .£2473. Where the
Commissioners succeeded they got <£39 costs
from the two land-owners concerned. After
this experience of arbitration in land-purchase,
the Commissioners gave it up.” The arbi-
trators, on an average, awarded about 28 per
cent, more purchase-money than the railway
valuators offered, and this in instances where
they had been forced into offering what they
considered an extravagant price.
A slab of Justice Williams’s libel-law:—
“Nearly every point in the case (Speight v.
Syme) could be used to illustrate the defences
of justification and fair comment, and on the
plea of fair comment the jury had to look at
the facts which had been proved by defendant
to have existed at the time the comments or
criticisms were made, and not to Mr. Speight’s
or his witnesses’ explanations. On the plea of
justification, which had to do with the truth of
the charges, they must, of course, regard the
explanations and evidence of Mr. Speight, but
for the purposes of fair comment they had, if
possible, to put themselves in the position of
never having heard a word from Mr. Speight
or any of his witnesses.” The Williams theory
of fair comment is even more satisfactory to
certain editors than the Hodges theory, ex-
pounded at the first Speight v. Syme trial. A
public man who is frequently seen entering or
leaving a brothel may be called a “notorious
fornicator”—according to Judge Williams.
He brings an action for libel against the
newspaper that refers to his scandalous
conduct, and he proves that he went to the
bagnio in a purely missionary capacity. His sole
business there was to convert the residents.
He satisfies the jury that he acted as a Sama-
ritan. But the jury must look at the
facts which existed before the politician’s
religious fervor became known. They must
say that it was fair to draw the worst conclusions
from his visits to the house of evil reputation,
and find for the defendant journal. In criminal
law a man is supposed to be innocent until his
guilt is proved. In fair comment libel , law a
man starts by being very guilty, and remains
equal to guilty after his innocence has been
established. A peculiarity of “ fair comment”
is its restriction to “great” newspapers only.
A little newspaper, The Bulletin imagines,
has no claim to this line of defence. The mis-
statements of a cheerful publication, as dis-
tinguished from the lies of a penny news-sheet,
are scurrilous, blackguardly, infamous, and
utterly revolting. Fair comment is a privilege
of the organs that play the dullest tunes.
Dear Bulletin, —The worst feature about the
Paraguayan exodus is the way in which Lane’s
followers and professed friends have rounded
on him. Several of those who fawned on
him when he was popular are noM de-
nouncing him. I see that one of the disaffected
Parargohauts, a noted jawster, on being aiked
his opinion of the English labor movement,
gave it as his mature belief, after a whole
week’s observation, that they were dreadfully
split up from gangrened jealousy. This would
not be an invidious statement if it came from
anyone else but the man who rounded on his
political father, Lane. After all, Lane,
with his ideals destroyed, his hopes blasted,
and all his airy castles tumbled to the
ground, is worth a whole shipload of the
dogs who licked from his plate in his prosperous
days, but who yelp at his heels now that he is
discredited. Lane’s head was large enough to
contain schemes for the beatification of all
humanity. He gave up assured literary success,
and certain worldly reward, for his ideal. He
has failed, because the day for crusaders has
gone by, the age of chivalry is dead, and enter-
prises of that kind now attract only the cranks,
the permanently dissatisfied, and the mentally
unbalanced. A latter day Don Quixote, Lane
never allowed for the windmills (nor the wind-
bags), and even his Sancho Panzas were
humbugs always prepared to steal his
kingdom and his brains. Future generations
will regard Lane as an heroic figure in an
unheroic age, and history will forgive him for
what he failed to do, and remember vW. be
tried.—Yours, J. D. Fitzgerale
The suggestion to pay New South Wales M.’sP.
so much per attendance, a maximum total
being- fixed, is not new. It was tried in
Queensland, in the days of the Griffith 10-
millions-loan regime. The pay which that
master of snuffle and shuffle dictated was—
“two guineas per sitting; no member to be
allowed more than .£2OO in one year.” The
Clerk of Assembly was required, within a
certain time limit—if the writer remembers
rightly, half-an-hour—to log the names of all
members who had showed their noses by then.
Those who came in afterwards didn’t count,
except —so rumour said —by special request.
The system, as may be at once guessed, led to
queer antics. It was great fun to see
Mugwump, M.P., put in an easy appearance,
stay quietly until the “attendance log ” was
duly entered up, and then disappear for the
evening. The only good the system effected
was to limit sessions practically to 95 nights.
The idea of Bavistek, M.P. (N.S.W.), to pay
per attendance at divisions only, would never
have suited Mugwump, of ,Banan aland. The
whip would have had to scoftr the theatres, the
pubs., the oyster-saloons, the cottages omies,
and the police-cells to round him up in any
respectable number. For of such is the “piece-
work ” legislator.

Messrs. Malpas, of Gladstone, Q., are
sending to England half-a-dozen frozen turtle as a
trial shipment. And now that new markets are
being made, why not tin the edible part of the
passion-fruit? It is the commonest of Australian
fruits and grows on every fence in the land. Yet
you could not buy it in England for gold. It only
wants a start to be immensely popular in Europe.

The policy-holders of the Colonial Mutual Life
Assurance Society— next to the A.M.P. the hipest con-
cern of its kind in Australia, and after the A..M.P. and
the Maoriland Govt. Insurance Department, the biggest in
the southern hemisphere—would do well to make some
inquiry as to how their funds are employed. Judging
solely by the figures in the balance-sheet, the inference is
that the Colonial Mutual must have made some very
unlucky investments. For a year or two back its
funds have yielded the lowest rate but one among
the six hig Australian offices, the Mutual of Austra-
lasia having the very lowest. This in itself is
rather a good feature, for high interest gener-
ally goes with very bad security. The Colonial Mutual,
however, seems to have got low interest and a consider-
able amount of inferior security as well. Its funds
amount to £1,662,301, and of this £530,336 is in “ Free-
hold and Leasehold Property.” Bricks and mortar are
not the best kind of property, and the Colonial Mutual
apparently has more of them than any other office in
Australasia. It has a larger percentage of its money in
furniture and sundries than any other office except the
A.M.P. Also, in the matter of uncollected interest and
rents it breaks the record. The following table is
interesting:—
Interest and Ditto, Out-
Rents. standing and
1893. Accrued.
A.M.P. .. .. „ £668,793 £54,725
Mutual of Victoria .. 44,762 11,925
Mutual of Australasia 52,517 14.046
National Mutual .. 71,047 19,059
Widows' Fund ... 55 798 11,081
M.L. Government ... 108,097 27,127
Colonial Mutual .. 81,026 55,743
The Colonial Mutual has thus considerably
more than twice as large a percentage of interest and
rente outstanding as any other of the seven offices above
quoted. What the policy-holders ought to know is: (1)
How much, if any, of this is absolutely irrecoverable ; (2)
In these cases, if there are any, where the interest is not
recoverable, what is the prospect of recovering the prin-
cipal? The evil is apparently getting worse, for whereas
this item, at the end of '92, stood at £39,324, at the end
of ’93 it had increased to £55,743. Last year’s financial
disasters struck all the offices more or less by reducing
the rate of interest derived from investments, and also, to
some extent, by increasing the difficulty of collecting
such interest as there was, but in the latter respect the
Colonial Mutual seems to have had far worse luck than the
average. If the directors have any satisfactory explana-
tion to offer it should be made at once. So far as can be
Judged from the outward semblance of things, either the
Colonial Mutual has the worst batch of investments among
the seven big offices mentioned—or else some of the other
six have artistically improved their balance-sheets by
adding the overdue interest to the principal under the
head of “mortgages.” Until there is a systematic State
audit such a thing is quite possible.
The Maoriland Government Department—the
only Slate-audited office in the crowd—is also the only
one which keeps the “ accrued ” and the “outstanding ”
interest separate in its balance-sheet. The former repre-
sents interest earned but not yet payable; the la'ter is
interest overdue but not paid, and it is this latter item
which has a tendency to develone into bad debts. The
Maoriland Govt, office has only £2311 actually overdue ;
the other £24,815 is only “accrued." Why don’t the
Australian insurance societies adopt a similar system?
• • • ♦
In reference to the remarks made in last week’s
Bulletin as to the relative expenses of various Australian
life-insurance societies, there is one aspect of the case
which was, perhaps, not made sufficiently clear. A large
part of an insurance office’s expenses consists of commis-
sions and medical charges connected with new policies.
Business is expensive to acquire, but costs, or should cost,
comparatively little to retain when once secured. There-
fore the expenses of a new office, where a very large pro-
portion of the business is in this initiatory stage, are
generally greater than those of an old one, and an institu-
tion which does a large new business usually shows a
larger expense account than one which is less progressive.
Last year the City Mutual had by far the largest expense
account among Australasian insurance offices, but in pro-
portion to its size its new business was three times as
large as that of the Mutual of Victoria, nnd considerably
larger than that of the A.M.P. or Colonial Mutual, or
even the National Mutual, which comes second nn the
list in this respect. Also, the City Mutual reports the
largest percentage of interest on its invested funds—
about £6 Bs. per cent, against the other offices’ average of
about £5 17s.

Some men and newspapers were a little too
previous about the wonders of the Wealth of Nations,
which owes its boom more to the gold of the London’-
derry than its own. Following so quickly on the heels of
the Londonderry, wishes become father to many people’s
thoughts. It had some marvellous sings cf gold ;so had
Cushman's, and many other Coolgardie mines; hut
wh-re are they now? Why this ominous silence? The
“ Wealth ” seems to be suffering from eclipse. Several
good judges who have seen the mine are prepared to
say its richness has been glaringly exaggerated.

this price, it is a good gamble; and as soon as London
learns details, and examines the £15,000 worth of specimens
taken to England by Fingall aforesaid, it will jump at the
mine at a capital representing double the price paid for
it. It will probably he floated for £480,000.

erected during the boom era, has lost heavily on the
venture, and has shaken the dust of Euriowie off its feet
and turned Westward. Which is a pity, as the syndicate,
besides making an honest effort to resurrect the prosperity
of the field through its own properties, gave encourage-
ment to other mine-owners and tributors by dressing ore.
Few, if any, of the latter can now continue at work, and
the syndicate’s failure is the practical collapse of the
Euriowie field.

Gold or whisky is at the bottom of most wars,
and the Corean war is no exception. Corea is a strip of
country, with nothing but hills, of about the same size as
England and Scotland combined, and on the mountain
range across its middle are the famous Phyong Kang gold
washings. Previous to the Japanese Treaty in ’76 these
produced hut small quantities of gold-dnst and speck
nuggets, all of which went to the king. The Japs, how-
ever, got these worked better. Concessions were granted,
and in ’B2 £70,000 worth of gold-dust was exported, and
this has now risen to about £250,000 annually. This
trade is almost entirely in the hands of the Japanese, and
there is no doubt that the possession of these workings is a
larger factor in the cause of the war than is generally
realised. The sum paid to the King of Corea now is one
onnoe of gold per month tor each gang of 30 men engaged
in the work.

The most nerveful thing in the way of company-
promoting which The Bulletin remembers is the “Cool-
gardie Golden Nugget Syndicate.” This enterprise is being
got up by the “ Real Estate Investment and Agency,”
of 250 Pitt-street, Sydney. The “ Investment and
Agency” doesn't supply any capital, or accept any
responsibility, but it takes one-twelfth of all profits. The
object of the syndicate is to send Mr. A. H. W. Hill to
Coolgardie to look for a reef, and Mr. Hill takes a fourth
of the profits, so that he and the “Investment and
Agency ” get away with one-third between them. Who
Mr. Hill is, or what are his special qualifications in the
way of finding reefs, is not explained. The “Investment
and Agency," which doesn’t supply one cent, of the
coin, or take any risks whatever, and which only owns
one-twelfth of the shares, is to nominate three out
of the six directors, the people who find all
the cash nominating the other three f and it
is provided by article 111. of the agreement that the
directors shall do pretty much as they darn well please.
The “Investment and Agency” gets all the cash mean-
while, and spends it, seemingly, anyhow it likes, there
being no expressed provision for any audit, or any publi-
cation of accounts. Also, the “Investment and Agency ”
runs all the office business, and keeps the books, and
generally looks after things.
According to the prospectus: “In the S.M.
Herald of Uth August, Mr. Alex. Forrest (a member of
the W.A. Government) speaking at Perth, said ‘Mr.
Dunn was of opinion that the Wealth of Nations mine
was worth at least £1,000,000 to-day.’ If Mr. Hill finds
another Wealth of Nations mine for this syndicate the
return to each holder of a £1 share would be about
£2000.” To which it might as reasonably be added that
if Mr. Hill finds 160 such mines for the syndicate, each £1
shareholder will get t'320,000. But then he won’t. Such
mines are not plentiful, to begin with, and the man who
finds such a mine generally finds it for himself, not for a
syndicate. In the matter of assurance the Golden Nugget
Syndicate seems all right, but as a gold-mining enterprise
it looks a gruesome frost.

A certain Southern master-brickmaker, who
owns, in close proximity to his various brick-yards, many
scores of houses, engages as workmen only those who
agree to become his tenants and pay him from 12s. to 15s.
for the privilege of living in houses which, at present
rent-rates, are worth not more than from Ss. to 10s. per
week. Compared with the average landlord of to-day,
who, when he calls round for his rent, generally finds the
tenant and the hack-gate missing, this individual sits on
velvet. The tenant who knocks about his property
simply has the amount of the alleged damage— at the
landlord’s own bloated valuation—deducted from his
week's wage and promptly gets “sacked,” for in these
workless days there are plenty of workmen only too ready
to fill the vacancy, and have their lives gradually
squeezed out of them. Moreover, no had debts are con-
tracted by this mode of business, the rent being deducted
every pay-day from the workmen’s wages. This trucker
consoles himself, too, that when a Truck Bill is passed it
will not interfere with his monopoly, because, as he
explains, he does not actually deduct the rent when pay-
ing the men, but simply counts out the full amount of
wages due and at the same time holds out his paw for the
rent, for which he gives a Receipt. No Truck Bill will be

Brisbane Figaro sometimes moves and

office had sores which needed licking, our loath-
some contemporary arose once more and went to
work. Figaro aforesaid now says that The Bul-
letin “is controlled, if not owned, by the Bank

may go round (Figaro being bought regularly at
printers’ job-rates and mailed through Queens-
land by people with axes to grind), it may be as
well here to say that neither the B.N.Z. nor any
other bank, firm, institution, or person, apart

The libel-action brought against Brisbane
Telegraph by Sub-Inspector Carr (for publishing

The Telegraph people unsuccessfully sought to

big Government official attempted to mediate, and
his efforts so far succeeded that the terms of a
paragraph of explanation were agreed upon by
both parties. Everybody thought the matter
was settled, when Carr’s solicitor demanded his
client’s costs. Telegraph managing-director
Cowlishaw said he would see Carr emphatically
blanked first, and the negotiations ceased.
Both the Argus and the Age lied in the
most preposterous manner all through the Vic-
torian elections. Take a lovely instance. Here
are two accounts of the same meeting, one held
by Mr. Murray Smith at Hawthorn. Argus
account: —
Mr. Murray Smith rose to receive such a reception as is
seldom accorded to a public man. The immense audience
rose to its feet, every hat was waved, and a tremendous
cheer arose, completely drowning out the hoots in the
back benches.
Now read the Age version of the same meeting :
The candidate went on to address the meeting, but the
hostility was too pronounced, and there was a continued
uproar which drowned Mr. Smith’s utterances. . . .
Mr. Smith continued his efforts to speak, but the meeting
would have none of him and got out of the chairman’s
control, with the result that he closed his remarks in a
few minutes.
As a matter of fact, both accounts were untrue.

Mrs. Annie Besant made her first appear-
ance in Sydney at the Opera House on Tuesday
0 [ last week, and established herself as a success
within ISmin. from the beginning of her lecture.
The chief drawback connected with the proceed-
ings was the Opera House itself, which is old and
dingy and cow-like in its aspect, and wears the
dusty, neglected, moth-eaten expression of an
orphan in despair. Partly, no doubt, by reason
of the gloomy and battered semblance of the old
house, the audience was not a cheerful-looking
one . The same crowd might have looked cheerful
in the bright Centenary Hall, but against the
faded pea-greenish background it looked a most
anaesthetic gathering. The Bulletin is prepared
to swear that every plain woman of uncertain age
in all Sydney —every woman who is either gaunt,
yellow, bony, wrinkled, shrivelled, tired, depressed,
sour or expressionless, every woman who dresses
in rusty black and wears large shapeless boots,
likewise every woman who has a hungry soul
looking out through two leaden eyes—was there
on the occasion. So was every man who has a
shaved upper lip, and a monkey beard, and a long
inky tail-coat, and a collar which isn’t so white as it
might be, and a shirt-front which has got crumpled
through the owner looking after “higher things.”
There was a row of elderly, daraaged-looking
women on the platform, and Judge Windeyer as
chairman. Judge Windeyer as an orator is just
one remove from wretched, and on his high
pedestal his legs looked disgracefully short, and
his body rotund, and the whole of him hopelessly
unpoetio. There was not one bright feature in
the whole dimly-lighted assemblage save Mrs,
Besant herself, with her pleasant, intellectual
face, and her silvery hair, and her white gown,
and tlie mystic ring which she inherited from the
boss visionary of her creed, Madame Blavatsky,
displayed on her strong white hand.
* * *
The impression she made, both at this and
subsequent lectures, was altogether favorable. No
other such eloquent woman, and rarely a more
eloquent man, has been heard in Australia before.
.She has no gestures, no attitudes, and—save a
tendency to exhibit the deceased Blavatsky’s ring
—no affectations. Her voice is clear, and her
diction faultless. Also, she is, in The Bulletin’s,
opinion, the most absolutely sincere missionary
who ever came to this country. Some of her
opinions would not look well on the top of a copy-
book, but all of them would look well anywhere
else. She denounces the sending of “ Christian ”
missionaries to the Moslem and the Buddhist
and the men of those other sects which are
commonly lumped together as “heathens.” The
only way, she says, to benefit the “heathen” is
to teach him to live up to the creed he has ; not to
compress him violently into a misfit faith which is
utterly unsuited to his temperament. She objects
to the trading instincts of the age, and wants to
make a bonfire of such books as the accursed
Samuel Smiles’ “Self-help,” and the tale of
“Samuel Budgett, the Successful Merchant,” and
the rest of the literature which deifies the small
boy that starts life with 6d., and rises through
patient industry to be a bloated and much-esteemed
grocer, and then dies and has a huge monument
piled with a sickly squash on to his bones. A
deep and pathetic love for humanity pervades all
her utterances, and she will probably make many
converts to Theosophy simply because she pre-
sents it as the religion of human kindliness and
brotherhood. Her comparative failure to explain
the meaning of her creed is probably owing to the
hopeless mistiness of the creed itself.
• • •
Mrs. Besant leaves Theosophy very much
the same large, loose, yearnful semblance of a
stupendous shade which it was before. Whatever
it may be to the person who believes, to tile person
who—like the present writer —wants to believe
and can’t it is merely a great, blubliery, shape-
less idea, which crawls with a beneficent intent
upon its stomach all the days of its life, and never
arrives at any defined place or purpose. It is full
of visions and vast, soulful imaginings, and of
mahatlnas whom no one ever sees, and re-incarna-
tions of which there is no evidence; and it has not
even the advantage, like the Old Testament creed,
of resting on the bald and well-defined assertion
of some legendary seer who is dead now, so that
it is impossible to prove that he was never alive.
But, whatever her creed may be, there is no room
to doubt Mrs. Besant’s sincerity, her eloquence,
her nobility of character, and her sympathy with
suffering in all its forms. And, after hearing her
persuasive deliverances, the present writer, who is
very tired of everything and badly wants to be re-
incarnated, if satisfactory arrangements can be
made to that effect, is quite willing to be a Theo-
sophist if he only knew how to begin. The
trouble is that Theosophy seems to be a globular
quicksand, with no beginning.

The universally-beloved Nellie Stewart
returns to Sydney Lyceum on Saturday, to be
the royal Brownlow in “Ma Mie
Rosette,” and finally to spurn his gold and remain
poor and virtuous, and most likely to lament over

Arrangements are being made in Sydney
for a dramatic open-air tete, after the fashion of
M n? ne was 80 brilliantly successful in
Melbourne, the proceeds to go in aid of the un-
employed members of “the profession,” who are
numerous, and many of them in very bad straits.
Ibe fact that Nellie Stewart (who is vortb a large
ortune to any coffee-stall), and the other houris of
ie comic opera co. will be available, makes the
Present mi eminently suitable time for the experi-
eut. The Cricket Association has granted the
se of its grounds for October 10, and an influential
committee is at work, Mr. J. H. Raiuford being
manager.

p .he Thornton-Arnold season at Sydney
riterion ends with two nights (Saturday and
Monday) of “ Captt. Fritz.” Then the On. will,
presumably, be given over to darkness again, and
there will be no more comedy in the city for some
tune to come.

Sydney has had no circus for some tew
weeks past, so the advent of Abell and
Jvlaer s co. at Redfern. next Saturday, should fill
a want. Ibis co. claims to have the best pack of
trained dogs and the best collection of educated
on » also, it boasts a large number
of horse-subjugators ” and other artists, iuclud-
xng a Hindoo by the name of Sing, who is lavishly
backed as the boss bare-backed rider in the
universe. Mr, Neville Forder, a well-known
Sydney pressman, is advanoe-agent.

Maggie Moore also announces the last
night of “ Struck Oil ”at Sydney Royal—in fact,
Sydney is placarded all over with last nights, and
everything seems to be coining to an end. On
Friday next a matinee is to be given to the in-
mates of the local charitable institutions, and the
halt and the blind and the toothless-will all be
admitted free. It should be a truly solemn
occasion when these pathetic wrecks are
gathered together. But probably the saddest
feature about this dead-alive audience will be that
it won’t go out to see another human wreck
between the acts, because there will hardly be the
price of a drink in the whole audience. Consider
the pathos of it—that great assemblage of dry
cripples who never expect to be decently moist
again as long as they live until they are washed
just before burial ! The spectacle will be more
depressing than an execution, and the man who
wants to be present at such a function must have
a fine taste for melancholy.

“Sowing the Wind,” the new play at
Melb. Princess’s, has one chief idea in common
with “Sweet Lavender.” Sydney Grundy, the
author, seems to have purposely drawn attention
to this fact by locating the first scene at Bar-
chester. From Bar/tohester, we remember,
Pinero’s banker came up to London to warn his
adopted sou against a mesalliance with little
Lavender, the result being the banker’s discovery
that Lavender was his natural daughter by a
sweetheart whom he had naturally betrayed and
deserted. The banker’s replica in “Sowing the
Wind ” is a Barchester man (Titheradge). He
learns with horror of his adopted son’s (Cecil Ward
again) mad infatuation for a lovely vocalist (Mrs,
Brough), of doubtful antecedents. Then Tith.,
the father by adoption, tells C.W. the story of
his own earlier days—how he, too, had wor-
shipped a strange goddess, and was only
saved from disastrous matrimony by the
exertions of his friends, Lord Boncicault and dear
old bachelor Brough, Lord Boucioault told
damaging stories about the goddess, whilst
Brough, an amateur man of the world, took the
truth of them for granted. Thanks to Brough
and his wise saws, Titheradge had shaken himself
free from the girl and achieved a respectable,
gouty old age. This story falls to work the
desired effect. Cecil Ward, a gallant johnnie
loafing on a handsome allowance, remains true to
the doubtful vocalist, and the old gent from Bar-
ohester lives to learn (although the shock nearly
carried him off) that the lady is the result of his
conquered passion aforesaid, born, like Lavender,
unbeknown to her illegitimate father. Titheradge
finds, moreover, that Ids child has been slandered
even as the mother was falsely accused at the
time he, her lover, listened to good advice and
behaved badly. A happy denouement is assisted
by Lord Boucioault, who cynically admits that he
worked upon Brough’s ignorance, and used the
shallow, sham judge of woman character as a tool.
After making winch statement Lord Boucioault
departs, leaving poor old bachelor Brough to weep
for his well-meaning stupidity.
* * *
“ Sowing the Wind ” abounds in fine epi-
grammatic writing, has some strong dramatic
situations, and is altogether a beautiful play.
Subordinate characters, intended to lighten tfie
story, dou’c lighten it much, more’s the pity, but
they are good as far as they go. The serious
interest comes to a head in a great dialogue be-
tween Mrs. Brough and Titheradge at the end of
the third act, which won three recalls on Saturday
night._ Yet none of the principals did full justice
to their parts on this trying occasion, and the per-
formance will doubtless improve rapidly. Mrs.
Brough was too loud and Paula Tanquerayish,
Titheradge’s emotion often lacked warmth, and
both the B.’s might have been a little more for-
cible. Cecil Ward, who is elegantly draped in a
green suit, can add a few details, whilst Miss
Noble, as a giggling virgin, will have to get a con-
sistent tone of voice. Mr. Dorrington plays
acceptably the part of a loutish baronet, and Miss
Romer, as a frivolous old piece of gentility, is
capital. It is a costume play, dated 70 years
back, for the sake of old-fashion effects, Goatcher
has painted a glorious garden-scene for the first
act, and the dresses and grouping of figures
against this bright background suggest a picture
by Marcus Stone. There is only a fortnight left
for “ Sowing the Wind ” to do great business in.

The third weekly effort of the Taylor-
Carriugton Co. at Melb, Royal is an improvement
on its dreary predecessors. An innocent convict
and a bloated squatter sustain a long, exciting
contest for the hand of Ella Carrington, and the
evil land-owner, who includes bushranging among
his many vices, gets wiped out. He seems to
prosper for a while, especially when his lawless
gang bear the substantial Miss Carrington away
to their mountain cave, but the other fellow ulti-
mately clears his character with a written con-
fession, and the lady looks as happy as she can,
considering that business is not very brisk.
“Unjustly Sentenced” includes a well-known
Melbourne horse and many other features of Aus-
tralian interest, such as new-churns on the wal-
laby track. A further appeal to national
sentiment will be made on Saturday by “ The
Bush King,” which is said to have been written
here and successfully produced at three Loudon
theatres.

Melb. Alexandra re-opened on Saturday
under the management of Inigo Tyrrell, who
is likewise the author and star supporter of “The
Life we Live.” Just now is not the time for
abusing Inigo’s drama, for events more horrible
than this have transpired freely in Melbourne
since Easter. In the light of recent experience
“The Life we Live” appears almost reasonable,
although the hero, a harmless little person, pro-
mises never to get drunk any more. But, as
regards Inigo Tyrrell’s attempt at low comedy,
language cannot meets its liabilities, therefore The
Bulletin prefers to remain silent. A diamond-
drill, a man suspended from a burning
telegraph - wire, and a variety entertain-
ment occur in the course of Inigo’s horror.
The gallery “guyed” this variety festival on
Saturday, but the author-actor-rnanager announced
in Monday’s advts. that he had engaged a com-
petent working staff in place of the “ bunglers ”
who had tried to kill his great work. Hans
Phillips, J. G. Joyce and old Harry Daniels are
satisfactory items in a small oast. Also, Miss
Millie Collier acts with plenty of intelligence and
a pair of nicely-balanced arms.

The Bijou is to break out again soon—

particulars will be disclosed shortly.

It is said that when the Lyric Club
amateurs first engaged Johnny Wallace to put
them through an opera the girls sidled up to that
remorseless veteran, and, having coughed several
times in a coaxing key, told him how nervous he
made them feel. His reputation for strictness had
preceded him, they said, and their sweet timid
glances seemed to suggest hysterics on very short
provocation. Johnny, therefore, used to struggle
with his feelings at rehearsal, until one day the
club saw plainly enough that the stage manager
must either swear or burst. He had stamped his
foot, and thumped his brow, and ground his
teeth without finding relief, and the club
felt for the wretched man. So the chorus sent
five of their most haughty virgins to Johnny
as a deputation. The deputation stated that they
came to express their heartfelt sorrow for the
club’s stupidity, which was generally admitted by
the club to be maddening to any gentleman of
his (Johnny’s) professional experience, and under
the circumstances the deputation had much
pleasure in saying, on behalf of all the ladies, that
if Mr. Wallace would like to say “Damn ” occa-
sionally he was at perfect liberty to do so. Where-
upon Mr. Wallace said “Damn!” occasionally
and felt much better.

Charles Ryley was not long out of harness after his
arrival in London. He has signed an engagement for 18
months, at £3O a week, to play Hayden Cotiin’s part in
the “Gaiety. Girl,” in the provinces, in London, and
during the proposed tour of the piece in America and
Australia. So let the girls cheer up. They will soon see
the “assassinator” again.

and trained stage stars? Making a rough list—Melbourne
has produced Melba, Frances Saville, Nellie Stewart,

Crossley, May Pollard, Isabel Webster." Again, where
are the Sydney stage stars?
R. S. Smythe’s turning of Talmage to account as an ad.
for Mrs. Besant was greatly admired in Melbourne: “ The
recent endorsement by Dr. Talmage of the commonly (!)
accepted interpretation of the Mosaic account of the
Creation will lend additional interest to the utterances of
Mrs. Besant on the Evolution of Man." Talking of Much-
Travelled R.S., not forgetting Carlyle, B.A. —does
the fair Theosophist think very highly of their com-
mercial ideals? Are the Smythe souls working onward or
backward?
A unique specimen of stage-struck girlhood cropped up
in a Melbourne law-case the other week. The young
aspirant in this case had written to Daisy Chard, of Frank
Clark s variety company, slating that she was burning to
go upon the hoards, and undertaking not to make the
other ladies jealous. She was neither “ good-looking nor
anything else, so she wouldn't be in anybody’s way,"
said this poor little novice. Having announced her deter-
mination to come to Melbourne and get an engagement
somehow, she implored Daisy Chard to meet her at the
station, where she might be recognised at a glance by her
superabundance of freckles. Her only claim to distinc-
tion was a yellow, browny-spolted complexion. “lam
always known by my freckles,” she plaintively observed.

When Ryley was playing at London Savoy he was noted
for being lace for rehearsals. One day he was much
hehind-haud, and the genial Gilbert, when he arrived,
was heard to say something about the “ inconvenience of
being kept waiting for such an indifferent actor.” Ryley
bottled up his wrath, and a few days after he returned
from Australia he otianced to meet in the street Gilbert,
who said how pleased he was to see him, and how
delighted to hear of his success in Australia, adding that
he was writing a new opera, and that he had a part which
would just suit him. Ryley, equal to the occasion,
replied that he had secured an engagement, adding,
“And, Mr, Gilbert, I had no idea that you would think so
indifferent an actor worthy to take a part in your opera.”
John Lemmone, the Australian flautist, is to go on
tour with Melba.
Ada Crossley has apparently “ fetched ” Melba. After
Mrs. Vanderveer Green had told the Gippsland girl that
six months under Marches! would put her right at the
top of the tree, Miss Crossley waited on Melba and sang
to her. “I was less nervous than usual, because I was in
such splendid voice. . . . When 1 turned to her there
were tears in her eyes, and she said, ‘ Oh, what a glorious
voice ; I’ve heard nothing like it for years ! If you were
ready you should join me on my concert tour through
America at once. Mme. Marches! has a Miss Mandelssohn
with a fine voice, but it is not to be compared with yours.
I’ve never been so touched in my life. The world wants a
voice like that.’ Of course this was very flattering to me,
and 1 felt it was genuine because she was so excited, and
her manner became at once quite warm and affectionate.
Then she sat down and wrote: ‘My Darling Madame,—
This is to introduce Miss Ada Crossley, whom you have
already heard of. She has a most glorious voice, and 1
predict a great future for her if sha has your tuition.
Your loving pupil, Nellie Melba.’ ’’

Dear Bulletin, — 1 have been to see ‘‘Lady Winder-
mere’s Pan,” and I venture to sneer at horse hair Wilde’s
collection of colloquial bric-a-brac. My objection is that
the works are too .evident; you see the wheels going round
from start to finish, and are painfully reminded of the
dreadful, decayed British humorist who constructs a five-
shilling situation in order to render possible the birth of
a three-halfpenny pun. Oscar, I take it, collected a list
of epigrams, paradoxes and caustic cynicisms, during his
long literary life, with the deliberate malicious intention
of eventually writing a play round them. What 1 hate
worst, however, is to have one of my cherished notions of
swagger society people at ’Ome upset thus ruthlessly.
Oscar’s swells talk in 20 minutes the smart tilings it took
him Heaven knows how long to manufacture or collect.
The play is supposed to be a reflection of life, the ex-
asthete is content to make it a reflection on life. He
hoped to make society people smart—he made them too
smart and defeated his object.—E.D.
When Lohr was at Gisborne (M.L.) with “Charley’s
Aunt,” he hired an intelligent native to translate the
bill into Maori for the benefit of the local aborigines. The
native took various liberties with the bill, and filled it
with baseless assertions about dancing, juggling, ground
and lofty tumbling, circus ponies and the like, and Lohr
circulated the fraudulent document with a childlike faith
in the honesty of his interpreter. The result was that
250 Mao.is tramped indignantly out after the first
act, and solemnly cursed Lohr by the soul of Hineraoa
and other swears and objurgations, while that misdirected
manager mistook the emotion for applause. He has now
lost all faith in Maori interpreters.
West Coast Times (M.L.) soulfully yeagns over Miss
Adair, the Yankee parachutist, and her balloon ascent :
“ The sensationalism of the act in a man draws crowds of
people, but when a young lady of Miss Adair’s birth and
education, delicately nurtured and reared in the midst of
luxury on her parent’s plantation in Texas, trusts her life
to her trapeze bar and parachute, the coldest and most
unsympathetic of people are roused to a pitch of enihu-
siasm such as is never seen at any other entertainment or
performance." If she had b-en delicately nurtured on
her father’s selection at Boggabri there would probably
have been no enthusiasm worth mentioning.
Theo. Ward, the young London composer from whose

concert co. is a manifest injustice to theatrical managers
Musical “critics ” are, in many cases, the mere creature?
of concert syndicates, and their monotonous yarns about
the same two or three singers and instrumentalists, who

perhaps, they are so paid for.
The clerical parent of a popular Southern lady ex-
amateur was at first much averse to his daughter
going on the stage, and exacted a promise from her
that she would not appear professionally while she bore
his name—t.e., remained single! To his horror, her
public appearance followed soon afterwards, but she did
not break her word with her rev. father—she had been
married sub rosa a week previously ! The marriage,
which occurred over a year ago, became known quite
recently to the families concerned and the public.

Frank Madden was returned unopposed to
Vic. Assembly at the general election under
peculiar circumstances. A Mr. Bolton came for-
ward in the Liberal interest, and, though he
caused no special enthusiasm, the party accepted
him rather than run two Liberals, and thus split the
vote. He held meetings right up to the day of
nomination, but on that eventful date he and his
deposit failed to turn up. No notice had been
given of his intentions, so there was no time to
get another candidate, and Madden had a walk-
over.
The Bulletin presents the portrait of Mr.
Dowell O’Reilly (on page 10) the young member for
Parramatta, who attained to fame only the other
day by carrying a motion in favor of womanhood
suffrage through N.S.W. Assembly by a large
majority. The motion was mutilated somewhat,
because Mr. O’Reilly drafted it to read that “ the
time had now arrived” when women should
have a vote, and another member carried
an amendment leaving out the assertion that
the time had arrived being evidently of
opinion that the time had always been there
and didn’t need arriving. Still the substantial
glory of the event remains with Dowell O’Reilly.
The member for Parramatta is noteworthy as one
of the few typical Australians who managed
to secure a seat at last N.S.W. elections amid the
frantic inrush of men from Brummagem and other
foreign parts. He secured his place by defeat-
ing, with ease, “ Hughey ” Taylor, an old-estab-
lished nuisance who came to the poll with a letter
of recommendation from Parkes, and was known to
fame as the man who always moved that the
House do now adjourn for tea. Mr. O’Reilly is
the son of Canon O’Reilly, and a graduate of
Sydney University—probably the first graduate
of that institution who is a democrat by
instinct, and who has shown any literary ability
worth mentioning. Further, he is distinguished’
as one of the only two “O’s” in N.S.W. Assembly _

Tasmania, will be 75 on Wednesday, Oct. 3. His
son is the chief delight of plaintiffs in affiliation
and criminal-assault cases heard in the Adelaide
police-court.
Upward is the Sergeant-at-arms in the

A POLITICAL ARITHMETICIAN.

Hon. John Stewart, M.L.C., who has
served in both N.S.W. Houses of Parliament,
is responsible for one, and only one, piece of legis-
lation. He caused Acts of Parliament to be
left unpunctuated.
Mr. A. S. Low, who died suddenly at
Merrylands, Sydney, the other day, after returning
from Peak Hill (and just after assuring his life for
.£8000), was a pioneer of mining at Gulgong,
where he “ struck it rich.”
Evangelist M‘Neill to an Adelaide
audience : “I tell you that many of the people in
this hall are among the meanest things that
crawl.” It was surprising, too, how reverently
they looked up to M‘Neill.
Tom Glassey, leader of the Q. Labor
party, is frequently away from the House ill.
He admits that physically he is not the man he
used to be, but his antipathy to the Tory party
grows stronger every day.
Chief-Secretary Gordon, of S.A., describes
Clement Wragge as “ a meteorological blackleg.”
As Wragge supplies bad weather and droughts at
lower rates than any of his competitors in the
business the name ought to stick.
Last week’s obituary : That snappy writer,
Ross Cox, of Melbourne, who believed with Sir
Walter Scott, “Literature is a good staff, but a
bad crutch.” So he combined the leaderist with
the school-inspector while he could.
Veteran Dean Macartney (Melb.) might
long ago have been Bishop of Melbourne, had he
liked. The see was offered him more than once
after he had passed his three-score years and ten,
but he declined on account of age each time.

DOWELL O’REILLY, M.P., the proposer of Woman-suffrage
in N.S.W. Assembly,
Parkes is being daily importuned to take
the absurdly-gaudy portrait of himself out of the
vestibule of a Sydney photographic gallery.
Fully a score of people declare they have met the
replica of the portrait among the attendants in the

Explorer Ernest Giles gave up gold-dig-
ding to become a clerk in Melbourne G.P.O. in
the early fifties. From the post-office he went to
the County Court, and resigned to join a Queens
land exploring expedition. He is now leading a
Westralian prospecting expedition.
The chief beneficiary in a recent huge will
was the_ testator’s widow, who arrived in Mel-
bourne in charge of a jewellery show-case at the
Exhibition. While so engaged she captivated
the law-loving f' msus, and she can now get her
cheque honourt 'I i a quarter of a million. What
shall we do with uur girls?
Jerorae K. Jerome, explaining his piracy of
“ Banjo’s ” “ Ace from Snowy River,” says he did
not steal it from The Bulletin, but borrowed it
from an American paper that gives him the
privilege of lifting its stuff. The receiver is as
bad as the thief. Likewise, you can size-up people
by the company they keep.
Alfred Deakin is making a study of the
revolutions of the world, with the idea of writing
a book. He surrounds himself with big histories,
which he reads in tram-cars and in court. It is
not believed that he has any intention of leading
a revolutionary movement in this country. He is
much too respectable for that.
Annie Besant’s face is wrongly described
as “refined.” It is strong and dignified ; but the
features are coarse—the nose short and thick ; the
mouth and chin clumsy. Her eyes are fine and
her forehead good. Her hands and arms are well-
made, but not delicate; her figure is full and
shapely. Altogether, a woman.
“Adrian Ross,” writer of librettos for
Gaiety burlesques, is identical with A. R. Ropes,
author of the fine poem “ Ghosts ” reprinted in
The Bulletin three issues back. Which proves
that a poet may also be an able burlesque writer,
but does not prove the converse that a burlesque
writer is the same thing as the poet.
Madame Christian, the popular contralto
vocalist, who not long ago ’verted to the Catholic
Church as a result of Charles Santley’s teaching,
is to leave Melbourne as soon as she takes her
benefit. She will then settle permanently in
Sydney, where several leadings ociety women
have already secured her a promise of many pupils.
A N.S.W. country paper thus cordially
“ sends off ” a departing medico : “ Dash Hyphen
Blank, Esq., M.D., it is said, is about to leave
this district. He came unsolicited. He remained
here uusympathised with and unsympathetic. He
leaves unlamented, and, no doubt, when he gets
away his abuse of the place will be unsparing.”

Sydney Morning Herald having referred
to the “late” Mr. Harwood’s performance of
Uncle Cattermole, the comedian in question took
an early opportunity to assure himself, by looking
in the glass and feeling his mortal frame, that he
was no later than usual. Henry Harwood is alive
also vigorous. He doesn’t remember to have eve,
_ r
felt less dead than at present, and he will not
dream of dissolution without advertising his
decease in the Morning Herald, so that no mis-
take of the same kind may occur again.
Dr. W. H. Dutton, of Melb. divorce
notoriety, intends to keep the Arrowtown (Otago)
Hospital committee to its engagement. He
was selected medical officer from 31 applicants,
and duly appointed, and he maintains that, as he
had done nothing wrong since his appointment,
the committee had no power to cancel the engage-
ment.
Dr. Augustus Mueller, the apostle of the
strychnine antidote for snake-poison, owes his
interest in such researches to the fact that, 35 years
ago, soon after his arrival in Australia, he was
nearly killed by a lively tiger-snake. The doctor,
by the way, is an enthusiastic vigneron, and took
several prizes for wines at the recent Yio. Agri-
cultural Show.
The cherubic Henry Manners-Sutton—
who looks more like F. W. Haddon than ever—
after many trials at many games, has now dropped
into the secretaryship of the New Oxford and
Cambridge Club. A good selection, says The
Bulletin’s London correspondent, for he is a bon
vivant to the very ends of his nails, and can order
a better dinner than most men.
National Ass Willcox, Mayor of Adelaide,
loves to bask in the sunshine of vice-regality.
The following appears in S.A. Advertiser ;
Mr. T. G. Ellery, private secretary to the mayor, writes
under date of Friday—“ Will you kindly note that his
Worship the Mayor was present at the show yesterday at
the receiving of the Governor, and that he left the
grounds with his Excellency.”
A “ society ” Sydney daily says that some-
body or other has been entertaining “Lord
Frankfort,” who is at present visiting Australia,
and that Miss Cleopatra Johnson was at the
party. Who is Lord Frankfort? The present
writer has been reading English papers for 25
years, and he has never yet taken up a ’Orne
journal without encountering the name of a lord
he had never before heard of.
A very smarc and wealthy Australian resi-
dent, some years ago, made over most of his
fortune to his son, with an eye to the avoidance of
succession-duty. Then the son died, bequeathing
his father’s pile back to him, and the sagacious
old man had to pay probate and succession-duty
on his own fortune. When he dies another suc-
cession-duty will have to be paid, so the State
gets at that sagacious father twice over.
Dr. Black, Melbourne, is dead, aged 95.
At the original Sydney Crown auction, he bought
one of the Melb. lots, corner Swanston and Col-
lins-streets, when that part was wild forest.
Coming to Melb., his lawyer, who lived in the
township at the west end, told him his lot was
quite out in the country. Dr. Black held this
golden corner, long known as Neave’s buildings,
right up to the present.
Hori Grey struck a bad snag once at
Leeston, Canterbury, M.L. In Parliament he
had spoken of the electors in that locality as
“country bumpkins,” and by invitation became
to Leeston town-hall to explain the obnoxious
term away and set thinsrs right. He gave the
bumpkins two hours of “Destiny, Human Race,
Unborn Millions, and Utopia.” A big, lanky
Scot, who spoke with a Bible twang, in a eulogistic
speech proposed the usual hearty of thank B

to Grey, whom he designated as “The Grand Old
Utopian Politician.” It was carried by acclama-
tion, and to this very day Hori Grey isn’t quite
sure what was intended.
A PLEA FOR REPUBLICS.
The great standard, and the only true basis of
value throughout the world with all nations, in
Labor. Frossard’s Cavour Cigars are a striking
instance of the fact alluded to, for loyal labor
has originated their good value, in which lies the
secret of their success and universal popularity.
Frossard’s Cavour Cigars are mild aromatic, and
give pleasure to all, while the cost of a packet
being only one shilling puts them within range of
everyone. They are smoked by the millions ; they
are a genuine democratic article originating from
a republican country.
The late Detective Otto Berliner left the
Vic. detective force because of his outspokenness
in the matter of the murder of Margaret Graham
at Daylesford, for which a man named David
Young was executed. Berliner was sent up to
investigate, and made a report in opposition to
that of old “Jack” Williams, who held that
Young was the murderer. Berliner was equally
sure that Young was innocent, and he asserted
that Williams placed the wipe which hanged
Young upon the mantel-shellm Graham’s hut.
Evangelist M ‘Neill has a worldly brother
named Joe living at Sheekago. When the noisy
saint was in that town Joe couldn’t stand it, so he
went for a holiday some 300 miles away. After a
week’s absence M’Neill received a letter, asking
him to forward 25d01., as the exchequer had run
low; but Joe, knowing John’s dilatoriness in
answering letters, enclosed a self-addressed
envelope. Poor John almost fainted when, on
opening that envelope, he found a letter something
after this style “My dear Joe, —I received your
letter all right. Glad to hear you are enjoying
your holidays, and hope to see you back soon. I
enclose the 25d01., as asked. Ever your loving
brother, John.”
An ex-Fort-street school-boy, aged 18
years, paid <£6o and joined the Royal Tar on her
first trip to Paraguay. He got so disgusted with
the constant quarrelling amongst the settlers that
he made up his mind to strike for home again.
Accordingly, he left Villa Rica in December last
and landed in Sydney early in this month, having
travelled 30,000 miles and encountered many ad-
ventures. Carrying his swag through South
America, he did a few weeks’ navvying in the Ar-
gentine, and worked his passage as a deck-hand in
trading-vessels of several nationalities, with a
fixed determination of reaching Australia. Young
Sorensen doesn’t regret his trip, and thinks the
experience well worth £6O.
Another literary buccaneer cheats S. F.
Argonaut of August 6 into printing Brunton
Stephens’verses, “ A Piccaninny,” not only with
authorship unacknowledged, but headed “To a
Papoose,” and preceded by this note :
The following verses were received from the Indian
country, where they were composed by a gentleman
attached to a command there who has the Protean quali-
fications of guide, scout, newspaper correspondent
hunter, and, as will be seen, poet.
The thief omits unsuitable verses, and gets “ local
colour” by introducing a “ Si wash ” and carefully
substituting “ Digger ” for “ nigger.” Is this the
first result of exhibiting a copy of Brunton at the
big Chicago fair ?
The stipendiary man-butcher of a certain
Australian province has several favorite pubs
which he patronises. At some he is served as
other customers, but at one particularly he is
singled out (without his knowledge) for special
treatment. When he first bestowed the honor of
his custom upon this particular hostelry the pro-
prietor made it a rule that any glass used by the
hangman should be at once broken, believing that
it would prejudice business were customers offered
a glass which might by any chance have been used
by the man-slayer. This, however, was an expen-
sive proceeding, so the landlord had a small
cabinet fixed under the counter, in which are kept
one pint measure, one half ditto, a tumbler and a
wineglass, for the sole use of Her Majesty’s finisher
of the law. The gentleman’s favorite tipple is
rum.
Mr, Frederick Young, it is
cabled, has written the London
press that ere the Australias are
asked to contribute directly to the
cost of national defence they must
be granted an equitable share in
controlling the expenditure. How
Mr. Frederick Young aforesaid,
who is always blithering about Aus-
tralian questions, managed to bar-
nacle himself on to this country is a
mystery. He is understood to have
started life as a copper-smith in
“the City,” and, so far as people
here know, has never been to Aus-
tralia in all his life.
Although Marshall Hall never
lost an opportunity of telling Aus-
tralians that they were musically a
“Godforsaken lot,” it seems they
know how to “spot” an artist-when
he comes before them. At 1< ast,
they have in the person of the white-
bearded Herr Moosbrixgger. It has
just leaked out that he is the great
Brochet, Adelina Patti’s tt nor, over
whom the world of Paris went wild
some 25 years ago. Just about that
time he retired ; and now he has
come to this end of the world with
a new voice. He came only to seek
a son who is growing maize and
garden-stuff in the wilds of Gipps-
land. But he brought this message
to his old confrere, Baron V"ii
Mueller : “ The Academy of Muni h
sends greeting, and 30 years’ re-
membrance to the Humboldt of
Australia.” Baron Yon Mueller,
as'.everyone knows, is modest about
his own achievements, but, “Inde
interests of Art,” he took Hi rr
Moosbriigger to Herr Pahst, hence
Herr M.’s singing at the Risregliato
Society, when everyone thought he
had come out of fairyland. The
contrast between his fresh voice
and his Father Christmas face is so striking that
the whole thing has the air of a tale about it.
Justice Foster must soon retire from
N.S.W. Supreme Court Bench —and in retiring
(though he has served nothing like the prescribed
term of 15 years) load the province with yet
another annual pension of .£lBOO. Mr. Foster is
a man who should never have been appointed to
the Bench at all. He is a narrow-minded, well-
meaning gentleman of limited intellect, whom the
Great Architect of the Universe obviously de-
signed as stipendiary president of a Little Bethel.

If so safe remedies are. within your reach at a
nominal cost. CLBMENTS TONIC and FLET-
CHER’S PILLS have never yet failed to cure the
worst cases. General debility, nervousness,
weakness, and general complaints of the digestive
and nervous systems are promptly cured by these
reliable remedies. They are prepared by scientific
processes, and are not merely mechanical mixtures
made only to “gull the public.” The renown
CLEMENTS TON IC and FLETCHER’S PILLS
have won in Australasia is proof of the fact that
they stand preeminent for their special classes of
diseases. No remedies ever sold gave such entire
satisfaction to their patrons, and evidence is
forthcoming from every city, town, and village
to prove their virtues. No doubt can now exist
as to their value, but purchasers must be careful
to get the genuine articles, as many unscrupulous
traders will attempt to palm off a substitute, if
possible, for the sake of extra profit.

The parting of the ways has at last come
between the S.M. Herald and M'Millan. On
the one day, M‘Millan threw in his lot with those
who plot to sell the Sydney trams, and the
Herald resolved to boldly oppose the project.
M'Millan’s conversion to exploiting syndicacy
goes on natural lines, but it shows the world
moves when the Herald stands up boldly to
advocate a front plank in State Socialism.

Why do civil-
servants, right
through Australia,
almost invariably
‘‘vote Conserva-
tive” and despise
the Labor cand l
'dates? It is the Conservative majority which
cuts down salaries to save monopolist lands and
incomes. The civil-servants, pampered in flush
times, are stuck like fatted pigs when State
revenues fall off. The Radical would fly at
higher game and tax property rather than personal
exertion.

The new Adelaide Labour weekly is to
appear early next month. For 10s. a supporter

What’s in a name ? Much depends on “ who gave

Yic. Labor-party didn’t fall into the error
of opposing men like Deakin and Best this
time, with the result that, though according to
Argus classification only 10 Labor-members are
returned, three-quarters of the present House is
solidly Democratic.
Only two Yic. candidates forfeited their
deposits at the general election, and, on the whole,
there was little vote-splitting. Were the Second
Ballot in action only 19 members would be liable
to go to the poll again, and of these a dozen would
be absolutely certain of success.
The Fat Man Legislators who represent
Rockhampton and district replied thusly to a
mass meeting of their constituents which pro-
tested by telegram against the Peace Preservation
Bill —“ We cannot believe our constituents under-
stand the measure.” They evidently cannot believe
that the men who were such asses as to elect them
can understand anything.
Melbourne suburban election incident.
The candidate had been filling ’em up again and
again, and a free and independent elector was
spread out drunk on the footpath under his com-
mittee-room window. A supporter of the other
fellow presently put his head in at the door, and
queried earnestly; “Say, mister, hadn’t you
better take in your sign ? ”
The gagging of Q. Labor members during
the debate on the Coercion Bill was evidently
pre-arranged. It was boasted that Labour mem-
bers would be shut up when Stephens relieved the
Chairman of Committees. Premier Nelson rushed
into the Chamber in his dressing-gown, and never
stopped a moment to enquire into the facts of the
case ; while Speaker Cowley refused to allow the
offending members to say a word in explanation.
The saddest feature of Yic. elections is
the return of the holy Mr. Harper for Bourke
East. The Argus rejoices that he is restored to
the country, as it is sadly in need of financial
advisers. The unblastable fatuity of the Argus
in persistently advertising Harper, whose financial
maunderings are the whole of the plagues oi
Egypt rolled into one, shows how hopeless are its
struggles to get out of its bog of conservatism. It
will never smash its old clay idols unless every-
body about the office dies suddenly one of these
fine mornings. Then the Argus might phoenix
somewhat. A few judicious deaths have been the
making of many papers.

The rejection of Buzacott’s Credit Foncier

The Victorian Labour-party has actually
captured the electorate of Toorak, once the
Windsor of the moneyooraoy of Cabbagegar-
denopolis, and the old-time shrine of Government
House. M'Kinley, the Melbourne Punch boss,
left such a nasty taste in Toorak’s mouth that
Labor-member Reid easily defeated Langton, the
Heaven-born financier of the calico party.
Sydney Truth has blossomed out as a
supporter of the Reid Govt, This is about the
most lightning volte-face ever executed by a news-
paper. It recalls the suddenness of the Yankee

able to light his pipe from the engine fire. Truth,
by the way, says it has “buried the hatchet.
But it carefully displays the Government “ adze.”
A candidate in a North-Eastern Vic.
mining township, without even the proverbial one
idea in his head, had stammered and coughed
through his address, and it was time for questions.
A long, lean miner rose up gradually from his
boots like a snake uncurling and started ; Look
here, mister, do you think, in yer own mind, you re
a fit and proper person to represent this con-
stituency?” The questionee did not go to the
poll.
Parry Okeden, the magistrate despatched

Armed with the Peace Preservation Act (Coer-
cion), Okeden and his band will patrol the Western

Apropos that vote of N.S.W. Assembly
that women should get the franchise at some
unstated future time : Man having made such a
muddle of tilings, woman thinks the time has
come when he should stand down and give her a
show. And, in a vague kind of way, man agrees
with her, but he isn’t quite sure that the right
time has arrived. So he’s going to sit down now
and wait till he’s quite made up his mind on that
point.
Under an old law of Geo. IV., still extant
in Queensland, persons can be heavily punished
for “unlawful assemblage” and a number of other
old-fashioned crimes that are almost forgotten
nowadays. Considering that every camp of union
shearers can be arrested and sent to gaol bodily
for unlawful assembly, and that every individual
“ striker” can be run in for about twelve different
offences in the far-reaching Vagrancy Act, the
new Peace Preservation law is just about three
times more superfluous than it originally appeared.
Its only object is to create a lying impression all
over Queensland, and all over the, world, that the
Australian workman is a revolutionary fury, and
that he must be kept down with a strong hand by
all right-minded lawyers, squatters and auc-
tioneers or else the country will be lost.
Let the Australian Natives’ Association
take this to heart and plume itself thereon.
Tozer and Byrnes (Q.) who have recently covered
themselves with political infamy by the introduc-
tion of the first Coercion Act into Australia are

measure are importations.
The beknighted Patterson’s awful con-
tempt for the press is all “sour grapes.” A

Hume: “The practice
of contracting debt will al-
most infallibly be abused in
every government. It would
scarcely be more imprudent
to give a prodigal son a cre-
dit in every banker’s shop in
London, than to empower a
statesman to draw bills on
posterity. Either the nation
must destroy public credit,
or public credit will destroy
the nation.”
Editor BuxtiETiK, —
Does anybody remember the
murder of Police-sergeant
Wallings near Dubbo (N.S.
Wales) about 15 years ago?
Perhaps not, but it points a
moral. Wallings and two
constables rode out to a road-
side pub. to arrest a fugitive.
When they arrived they saw
their man crossing a paddock
behind the house. He carried
a-revolving rifle, as was after-
wards learned. Wallings
drew his revolver, and rode
towards him, calling on him
to surrender. The man went
down on one knee and took
a deliberate aim at Wallings,
who rode round him trying
to get a chance of a shot.
The man fired and shot
Wallings dead. Now, if
Wallings had been armed
with a sword, or even a
heavy stick, instead of that
miserable pistol, he would
have simply headed his horse
straight for the kneeling
man at the best pace attain-
able and ridden him down.
But the man would have
fired all the same. Probably,
but the horse’s head and
neck would have shielded
the rider, even if the sight
of a horseman bearing dow r n
on him had not disordered
his aim. The chance of the
horse being shot dead is not
worth considering. There
are about 10,000 chances to
one against a shot directly in
front bringing down a horse.
It must hit him in one spot
so small that it could be
covered with a half-crown.
It was really his own re-
volver that killed Wallings.

J. B. Patterson’s meetings ip the (Oagtle-
maine (Yic.) district were religiously attended by
the local police. When the opponents of the
blatant butcher were numerically weak and in-
dividually old and infirm, the Ministerial “,copr
pers ” ejected them for interrupting “Sir James,’’
It is not legal for the force to remove a man who
openly criticises an election candidate whilst he
is speaking, bub Patterson’s official chuckers-oujt
professed to be maintaining lawanorder, and these
solemn outrages were perpetrated with impunity
—in the bush.
Melb, Aegus, having failed miserably to
win Victoria to Freetrade with puerile texts on
stupid little flag pictures, and puerile verses, and
absolutely idiotic leading articles, had the astound-
ing gall to publish, on the morning after the
battle, a banner bearing the strange device, “The
New House is pledged to Tariff Beform,” This
childish work of AKGUS fiction put the Tory
journal beyond the pale of intelligent pity. In
truth, even Fat Man is sick of his silly old organ,
now that it has given up all idea of catching the
general public (which rather frightened Fat Man
for a time) and become a mere penny ghost of its
old self. The twopenny Argus contained heavy
literary matter of some merit, but as a penny-
sheet trying to live by it i ordinary daily intelli-
gence it is a ghastly production.
The Argus pretends to gloat over the 20th
as a Freetrade victory. A few more such victories !
&c. The Protectionist cause had all the dramatic
effects this time. Graham Berry, Alfred DeaUin,
H. B. Hiergins, and George Turner came in with
a dash the devil himself would not lie about as
the Abgus does. The foreign-trade pets, McCrac-
ken and Cold ham, were completely dished.
Murray Smith got only 39 majority over a very
weak opponent, and that after the most marvellous
Tory canvass ever known in Victoria. Atßarvvon,
Levien would have been erased by an entirely new
man, Crouch, if six votes had been cast the other
way. A Liberal ousts the typical Freetrader,
Langton, at Toorak !!! Hancock’s 800 majority
made 10,000 people in Oollins-st., that night, sick
with delight. Major Smith and Francis Long-
more come back to Parliament to celebrate a
Freetrade victory in a House containing 00 per
cent of Protectionists.

Mr. Haynes’s motion, placed for Novem-

Here it is. “That this House, having ap-
proved the principle of political or fran-
chise equality for the sexes, now affirms
the justice of legal equality for the same,
and. therefore, urges the abolition of the’

JL ..C other day the writer, while passing a
/arge and eminently respectable - looking city
butchery in Sydney, was gratified by the spectacle
of a fat man licking price-labels with his tongue
and sticking them on the carcases. He put the
label well back in his mouth, as if he was going to
swallow it, moistened it thoroughly, and fixed it
on, and then he slapped the dead body with his
hand to make the ticket stick. When be had done
this about a dozen times The Bulletin man sud-
denly felt bad, and passed on. The meat-trade is
probably the dirtiest one going. The butcher’s
window is left unglazed, so that all the dust of
creation may blow in. The carcases are hung out-
side, and dogs come and scratch themselves
against them, and small boys whack them play-
fully as they go by, and skinny women feel them
to decide whether the quality is up to the mark.
And when the ticket horror is added to all the
rest it is too much.

A Yic. parson lectured, the other day, on
the question, “Is woman cleaner than man ? ”
After he had walked round the problem in all
directions, and considered the cleanness and the
dirtiness of both sexes from every possible point
of view, he summed up, in effect, that he didn’t
know whether woman was cleaner than man or
not. The only visible excuse for the lecture is
that the doubtful cleanliness of women drew a
3 arge audience.

Dear Bulletin, —Re this double-name
craze, here’s a fact. A Sydney man who happens
to have a stylish intermediate name was lately
told by his sister-in-law that she wished she had
been his wife, because then, instead of plain (say)
Jones, she could have been Mrs. (say) Lancaster-
Jones —“ with a hyphen, you know ! ” These self-
hyphened snobs must be fools, as well, not to
know that the caste with which they pant to
assimilate themselves is moved only to august
laughter by any combination not upon the brief
list of inherited compound names, some Australian
bearers of which, by the way, have actually
retrenched their patronymics lest they should be
confounded with people who try in this way to
“imply a grandfather.”— Montmokenci Robin-
son-Jones.

The average “trap” has truly a strange

Kanaka for murder, one of Her Majesty’s peace

T. A. Westwood, the first of the original
New Australia pilgrims to leave Lane, returned
to Adelaide some weeks ago, and has now gone to
Ooolgardie. He asserts that Lopez, Paraguayan
Minister of the Interior, altered the telegram sent
to England by Dr. Stewart, British Minister at
Asuncion, so as to make it appear that only eight
persons had left the settlement instead of 83.
Otherwise he thinks that the second contingent of
the Royal Tar’s passengers would have backed
out, for she lay in Adelaide waters for some days
after the receipt of the warning telegram from the
Secretary of State last December. Westwood
says several New Australians are so hard-up
that they will never be able to get even as far as

Some evidence given recently in a Christ-
church (M.L ) assault and battery case, furnishes
a lot of pleasant reflections about the ways of the
s ie-witness in her irresponsible moments. The
plaintiff, an almost unrecognisable mass of
bandages and sticking-plaster, testified, with
extreme reluctance, and under great pressure, that
she was the unmarried wife of the defendant, and
that, on a certain evening, they met in a quiet
locality, and he gave her a drink of lemonade.
Then he proceeded, for no visible reason, to pound
her on the head with the bottle until she was
nearly dead. When he had finished pounding her
lie repented and apologised, and carried the
battered form of his mistress tenderly home.
There finding that it was necessary to get medical
assistance and to offer some explanation of what
had happened, they sent for the police, and
the girl laid an information for assault against
another man, while her assailant corrobo-
rated the statement, and told how he
had rescued her from the brute in ques-
tion, and hauled him off his prostrate victim.
Somehow the arrangement fell through later on,
probably because the other man had too con-
clusive an alibi, so he didn’t get the two years’
gaol intended for him. But the plaintiff acknow-
ledged quite calmly, and with a lingering pathos
in her voice, that she still loved the man who
staved her head in with the bottle, and out of her
affection for him she had tried to get the other
man into gaol instead. She had no animosity
against the other man, but she recognised that the
police wouldn’t believe she had stoushed her own
head with the bottle, and, therefore, he had to be
sacrificed. She was so unaffectedly sorry that he
hadn’t been sacrificed, and so absolutely impassive
about it, that it was plainly no good lecturing her
on the utter sinfulness of her conduct, so the
court only sighed inwardly and made a mental
note that a woman in love was of no value as a
witness.

A Melb. paper tells a romantic story of a
man who, some twelve years ago, lost his sight as
the result of a gun-accident. His case was
regarded as hopeless, and he settled down to spend
the rest of his life in darkness. About five years
after the disaster, he fell in love with a girl—
probably because her voice was musical and
sympathetic, and her face and hair seemed at-
tractive to his touch —and they were married, and
lived happily until a few weeks ago. Then a
Melb. oculist undertook to operate on his eyes and,
to the surprise of the patient and everyone who
knew him, his sight was restored, and he saw his
wife for the first time. Whether they are living
happily now, or whether their peaceful home is
exploded in many pieces, isn’t known. The feelings
of a man, when he sees his wife for the first time
after eight years of married life, are probably
rather mixed. The man who marries a wife in
the dark takes a serious risk, and the one who,
having done that, looks at his wife in the daylight,
is a gambler of the most reckless description.

Still another development in the Te Kloot
(Sydney) divorce-case. Te Kloot applied for and
obtained a rule nisi in divorce with .£2OOO
damages against the influential and well-connected
co-respondent, which damages were ordered to be
settled on the faithless wife as a reward for her
infidelity. Then Te Kloot, an unfortunate Govern-
ment clerk at a microscopic salary (who had been
treated in a most rascally manner by his official
superiors), was ordered to pay his own and his
wife’s costs, which everyone was aware he couldn’t
possibly do. Finally, when he applied to have
the divorce made absolute, the court decided that
he was in “contempt” for non-payment of, or
rather inability to pay, the said costs, and couldn't
have his decree until he settled up, so he remains
in a partly-marred condition which is not very
definable. Next he will doubtless get into gaol
for his “ contempt,” and by-and-bye it will prob-
ably appear that being only partly unmarried he
is still liable for alimony. Truly there is one law
for the rich and 1G others, that-the rich never hear
of, for the poor.

Ab Christchurch (M.L.) Cathedral, three
Sundays ago, Parson Paseoe, holding forth on the
new Maori land Divorce Bill, said: “If the law
were altered so that women could obtain divorces
from their husbands on the same grounds as tho.-e
for which husbands can obtain divorces from their
wives, it would leave the door open for the disso-
lution of half the marriages in Christchurch.”
Then every woman in the congregation looked at
her husband with the expression of one whose
ideal was shattered, and there was a silence in
which the breathing of an .ant would have been

Corporal punishment in N.S.W. State-
schools is inflicted only in extreme cases, and each
case is recorded in a book kept for the purpose. A
certain inspector has a funny little way of asking
all scholars chastised on the day preceding his
visit to rise in their places. A comparison of the
number with the number recorded is generally
disastrous to the record. The same ingenious
examiner overhauls the blotting-pad to ascertain
if the attendance is marked morning and evening.
A man like this is lost in the Education Depart-
ment. He should join the Bradawl Brigade.

Dear Bulletin, — Be your constant stric-
tures on honorary J’s.P. An amazonian N.S.W.
State school-teacher exercised her muscle on a
pupil. The local School Board investigated, and
reported unfavourably. The parent issued a
summons and she was hauled before a police-court,
found guilty, and fined. Here I introduce the
J.P. Two members of the Bench were also mem-
bers of the School Board that had already investi-
gated. Naturally prejudiced against her—for
they had to find her guilty or eat their report —
they hadn’t the manliness to vacate the Bench
and leave the Stipendiary to deal with the case.
A side-light is thrown by the fact that a son of
one member had been severely caned, and has
since been expelled from the same school.— Milog.

The Yankee notion of a “ surprise wed-
ding” has been forced upon the attention of
Melbourneites for the first time. In the
earlier days of the present month a number of
friends were invited to dinner at a certain
mansion, and while they were still hanging about
for the signal of attack on the viands provided,
the young bride and her aged lover—old enough,
at any rate, to be her father—issued from their
lair of flowers and foliage, attended by the neces-
sary parson. Some of the local papers state that
the guests were thoroughly astonished and after-
wards overjoyed ; but, as a matter of fact, every-
body knew of the approaching marriage, which
had been announced in print weeks previously.
For the present all that we want is a “sur-
prise christening.” Gorger, a Toorak mag-
nate, is determined to try it when next he
becomes a father, which he calculates will be on

Neuralgia
is the first, surest and most reliable sign of nerve
decay; it is a symptom provided by nature to
warn the sufferer of approaching weakness and
distress. Though in most cases the pain is purely
local, the disease is constitutional; and local
remedies, such as liniments, oils and menthols,
only give temporary relief and do not do the
slightest permanent good, for they only act by
deadening the sensibility of the affected nerve.
The remedy, to be of any lasting benefit, must be
tissue-forming and nerve-strengthening, and must
have general invigorating properties ; it must also
contain the material to restore the lost tissue to
the impoverished nerves, and no remedy except.
Clements Tonic possesses these wonderful powers.
Clements Tonic has been used for thousands of
oases by young and old of both sexes for neuralgia,,
sciatica, and other nervous complaints, and we
have never heard of a case where it has failed to.

this side of three months. His olive-branches
number a half-dozen; but the advent of the
seventh is to be kept a profound secret until
subsequent day, when the latest addition to the
family will be introduced by its fond mother
to assembled relatives and friends. Of course
they too will be thoroughly astonished and marvel
exceedingly at the many manly qualities of
Gorger ; but how great will be their joy when the
housemaid with extended arms straddles in with a
basin of water, and the padre, who by this time
will have emerged from under the sofa, proceeds
to anoint the baby forehead with Yan Yean aqua
pura. A “ surprise funeral ” should next engage
the attention of somebody.

The other day a pale, anxious-looking
little boarding-house keeper was passing through
one of the Sydney parks when she saw a large
man on a seat, and recognised him as a boarder
who had fled some time previously, leaving his
bill behind him. He didn’t notice her, so she
attracted his attention by “ fetching him a
woodener” on the ear with her umbrella. Then
he got up with a yell and charged at her, and she
have him a whack which sent his hat flying
36f. While he was recovering from this she
whirled the umbrella round horizontally and
let him have an altogether surprising shock on
the jaw. Just here the ex-boarder gathered him-
self up and ran for his life, getting a prod in the
coat-tails as he started, and the little woman ran
after him, but was presently distanced. As she
bolted round a corner she collided with the flying
debtor’s brother and seized him. “ Where does
Tom live now,” she said, excitedly; “tell me,
for I’m going to get my money or know the reason
why.” “I won’t tell you,” said the brother,
doggedly. Then there was a biff that might have
been heard in tho next suburb, and a stunned
brother was sitting on a flattened hat in the
roadway, with a 7st, woman standing over him in a
threatening attitude. A large park official came
along at this moment and laid a hand on the in-
dignant female. “Just you go along out of this
quietly, ma’am,” he said, “or you’ll get into
trouble, you know.’’ “Oh, yes, I’ll get along
quietly enough so long as you don’t touch me.
Take your hand off me now, or I’ll break your
head with the umbrella.” And she whirled the
gamp with such dreadful precision that the official
backed hurriedly and contented himself with
walking behind her as far as the gate. That is the
only kind of woman who can run a boarding-house
and keep out of the insolvency court these times,
and even she doesn’t get more than a bare living.
The only woman who will ever make a hash-house
pay really well is a woman who can run like
Atalanta, and who always goes after the defaulting
boarder with a hatchet.
H. : “ The employer still has a few rags
and tatters of power. One of the Yic. judges was
passing a warehouse in Swanston-street, when a
porter came out, humping his sack, and bumping
his Honor, with the remark —‘ Look out, mate !
Judge ; ‘ Who are you calling mate ? I have a
good mind to complain to your employer.’ Re-
minds me of what I saw in Little Collins-street.
At the back of a swell place, a van was all across
that narrow thoroughfare. A drayman remon-
strated. Out came a bumptious personage, with
‘How dah you, fellow? If you are insolent, I
shall repaht you to your employah.”

The Saturday classes held at Fort-street,
Sydney, for the alleged benefit of metropolitan
State pupil-teachers, are to end at last, after some
40 years’ existence. Notices have been received by
the visiting masters and mistresses informing
them that after the end of the year their
services will no longer be required, as the
classes are then to be discontinued. The
province will save a vast sum by this wise
step. Each visiting master or mistress gets i>2s
per annum for one lesson of half-an-hour’s dura-
tion. But the education authorities won’t have it
that retrenchment is the object in view. One
high official avers that the main objection to eon-
tinuing the classes is the immorality of bringing
together so large a body of young people of both
sexes. Forty years is rather a long while to take
to study the moral aspect of the classes.

The Col-' 1 ■ e of the con-
gregation makes all the differ-
ence. A coasting captain
reached the bar of a Northern
river, the other day, and
noted with disgust that the
channel had shifted. A black-
coat was hovering anxiously
around, so the captain court-
eously turned and said,
“ You’d better go below for a
while, Mr. , I’m going
to swear.” “Oh, swear and be d d!” was the
unexpected reply ; “I’m away on a holiday.”
Opposition coaches run between Condobo-
lin and Forbes since the Wyalong (N.S.W.) gold-
rush. The other day the two coaches were at the
Condobolin end, awaiting return passengers to
Forbes. There was only a swagman. A fierce
struggle to ensnare him took place between the
rival Jehus. It ended in a “dead-heat.” One
coachee bundled in the man ; the other collared
the swag. And off went the coaches twain.
Arrived at Forbes, the swaggie had no cash
wherewith to pay the fare —spoke of being kid-
napped, and talked largely about damages-at-law.
Also of criminal proceedings anent the stealing of
a swag. Result: Liquor, apologies, and a trifle
to “see you farther on your road, mate.”

LAW OF LIEN.
Last week, at Sydney, under writ of habeas corpus,
Justice Foster enforced restitution to a mother of her
infant, detained by another woman as security for pay-
ment of its maintenance; he farther ruled that the
clothes it wore must (to with the child; and remarked
that the law did not provide for liens on babies.
“Have ’is carcase ” redivivus,
Tho’ these hairs so few and gray be,
Our posterity survive us—
Tuck thine aegis round the baby !
Loquitur presiding Justioe :
“ What, ma’am, could your reason pray be?
Sobbeth answer : “ Wrong’d my trust is,
For its keep I claim the baby.”
“Part,” quoth Law, “ that infant’s corpus
She : “ The duds I bought, my prey be.”
Law rejoins : “ No ruth can warp us ;
Clothes are parcel of the baby.
“ Need is clear for public stating.
Mortgaged wool and lambkin may be;
But we still lack forms creating
Valid lien on swaddled baby.”

My Dear Moorabinda—
Mrs. Annie Besant (pronounced Bezant on the
final authority of the Most-Travelled) made her
first bow to a Sydney audience at the local Opera
House last Tuesday under thetegis of Judge Win-
deyer. What most struck me in “ the most won-
derful woman of the nineteenth century ” was her
absolute naturalness, for I really believe the rose-
pinkness of her ears was caused by excitement
and not grease-paint, as an uncharitable person
used to the ways of actresses might be forgiven
fur thinking. In figure Mrs, Besant is not just as
straight as a bulrush, and her shapely hands are
tough-looking and sinewy. Despite a white silk
negligee ruffled with tea-coloured lace, you couldn’t
call the speaker graceful—she is too nervo-fibrous
to give a thought to posing, and doesn’t even
smile prettily when the crowd applauds, but
waits with a grim stoicism until the noise ceases.
1 don’t suppose Mrs. Besant sets much value on
the encouraging cheers of mobs, since, not long
ago, the whole world combined to hoot her.
I never heard anyone talk so well as Mrs.
Besant—whose voice and manner, by the way, are
here and there strongly reminiscent of Mrs,
Brough. She has the advantage of convincing
earnestness, and the various nuances of feeling are
so faithfully expressed that even a naked heathen
would know when to drop a silent tear and when
to show his teeth. For women, Mrs. Besant is
quite a little “East Lynne” on wheels. When
she gave pathetic particulars about baby match-
box-makers, so much audible sniffling and flutter-
ing of handkerchiefs among the women resulted
that she might have been Lady Isabel weeping
over her little Willie.
But if Mrs. Besant weren’t miles above material
things, I would most respectfully advise her to
take a few lessons in conventional stage deport-
ment, or else come on with a fan or something to
support herself by. The most wonderful woman
of her time has got her stage-legs, apparently, but
she hasn’t got her stage hands yet. She wears a
huge signet-ring—that, I am told, of the late
Mine. Blavatsky—and hangs on to it when she
is tired measuring from her nose to her chin with
her forefinger and nursing her left hand, which
she keeps at full point like a sign-post; but a lady
holding herself up by her jewellery doesn’t look
poetical behind the footlights. Mrs. Besant,’s
jewellery, by the way, is of a decidedly spook-like
character. A plain gold ring on the middle finger
of the right hand, the heavy seal on the left, and
about her neck a heavy necklace of round green
stones culminating in a little charm. When Mrs.
B. left the stage in her white gown and shawl and
her white hair she might either have been a dis-
embodied spirit or one of W. & M.’s living
statues (with a little more on) getting away from
her pedestal.
A tremendous crowd turned up at Mrs. Besant’s
first appearance. Ex-Fremiei Parkes listened
with every hair of his head while she deprecated
compulsory education—just as though he hadn’t
flooded the land with clerks in paper-collars and
cotton-backed governesses "with his Education-
while-you-wait Act, or whatever it is. I think
that some of the great audience were attracted by
the hope that the at-one-time interdicted authoress
might go close to the knuckle in her platform
remarks—but their disappointment must have
been keen when Mrs. B. took them over the
slummy side of London in generalising hops!
There was really some disappointment in certain
uninformed circles over the clever and magnetic
lecturess—whom I could' listen to for ever, pro-
vided I had a bun in my pocket. For instance, I
really heard a maiden pouting to her mother : “I
thought she was a Theosophist, but she never
made a cup fly! ” Evidently this ingenious
damsel imagined that the “Dangers which
threaten Society ” consisted of sudden and
unexpected flights of crockery-ware 1
Metrop. Day, at Rand wick, so long ago as
Tuesday week, must be set down as far and away
the best-groomed day at the A.J.C, Meeting.
There was a spanking show of apparel, and, naming
no names, a good-looking woman, tall and well-
formed, with dark hair and a splendid carriage,
simply walked away from the field in the ladies’
race. Her gown was mauve silk with the bodice
and full sleeves of mauve accordeon-pleated
chiffon. A sash falling in front of white
with a suggestion of black jet at either end, and a
black toque with three black feathers hanging off
at the back (somewhat suggestive of an ostrich’s
tail, I must confess) completed the get-up.
The Y.R. box was a long perspective of upper-
crust. Lady Hopetoun, as straight in the profile
as ever, though still looking pale (perhaps through
the nervous strain of being in the company of two
ladies respectively dressed in pink and blue silk
and tumbled gauze), wore a small pink checked
silk with a geranium-pink front barred with black
lace and a black hat with original garniture, and
presented the appearance of a noble sportswoman
who had been backing seconds all day. Lady
Duff wore mushroom-colored brocade of suburban
cut, made with aggravations of mushroom-satin
veiled (everything is as densely, deeply veiled now
as the girl with the painted face) with chiffon.
Also, Lady Duff has repented of her weird
millinery and taken to small bonnets with most
excellent results. Miss Norman’s plain frock was
of violet-checked material. Gov. Duff, in pale
grey, even to his kid gloves, and with a saffron rose
in his buttonhole, flaunted a snowy handkerchief as
if waiting for some beauty to throw it to a (a
‘Morocco Bound,” and a blonde A.D.O. was
chained to the side of a very pretty girl in art
green and a wide hat.
Mrs. Hatton was all in white, like Lot’s wif®
after the salt act. Miss Granville wore the color B
of diplomacy—black and gold. A society madam
in dark green, with appearances of pink, rather
reminded you of a tapped sugar-melon; and I saw a
stray man from Melbourne, who knew not his
Sydney, wink a wicked wink at a “ society ’’ girl
in bright cerulean blue and the sort of hat Mary
Ann wears at Chowder Bay pavilion. I thought
that inconsiderate wink was quite an eloquent
her Sunday frock in particular and
giddy-looking Spring fashions in general.
Judging by the financial success of the Hos-
pitals ball the other Wednesday, the committee
will probably keep to their threat of making an
annual of it. If they always bill it in the full-
blast of race-week it will inevitably repeat its
inaugural success. Decorations of evergreen
garlands, bunting and faint lilies, with here and
there a red cross like a Good Friday bun, made
the hall look really festive, and cosy corners and
tea - and - coffee buffets left no bare spot
under the balconies. Another factor of suc-
cess was the absence of sword-dances and
other variety-turns, which no dancing-girl
aches to stand on one foot and look at; floor
and music were as smooth as silk, and a poultry-
supper at an early hour (vice-regal movements
regulate supper-time, en parenthese; when vice-
regal folks go early the feast is spread before
eleven) was daintily set out in the vestibule and
decorated in a very tasteful way. The vice-regal
programmes (designed by Dr. Mailler-Kendall)
were in the shape of surgical bandages, .and must
have occasioned the convalescent Lady Hopetoun
an unpleasant twinge of memory, I should think.
Lady Hopetoun wore a simple dinner-dress of
mulberry faille with a velvet bodice and a diamond
star in her dark hair. Her Ex., of Victoria also
clutched a weedy handful of daffodils which
looked as if she had plucked them in passing, and
if that is the latest posey there is hope for every-
one with six square feet of flower-bed. The Earl
of H. (whom any lady novelist would call “pale
and distinguished-looking ”) sported a 16-hands
collar in addition to other articles of apparel, and
Gov. Duff wore his new ribbon. But an air of
inconsequent dressing hung over the vice-regal
group, who had been gotten up like butterflies at
the Government House ball the night before, and
there were not enough diamonds to make a caudle
look snuffed.
The most elegant gown which came within my
range of vision was worn by Mrs. S. A. Moss—a
Paris confection of floral brocade, strawberry-
coloured flowers and stripes on a cream ground,
the bodice with a deep shoulder-cape of cream
satin embroidered in gold and made with long
sleeves to the wrist and ruffles of old lace. A mili-
tary lad} 7 , in a bright yellow gown witti her dark
hair insufficiently poudre, reminded you (about
the coiffure, at least) of Mrs. Besant; and a plump
society matron in shiny beads looked like a new
sort of bug. Taking it altogether, the dressing at
the Hospitals’ ball was the weakest part of a very
festive shovy. Being a horribly official occasion,
all the military sparks were crammed into their
short shell jackets, which made Captain Gingah
look as if he had grown out of his clothing. But
since “ Uncle ” has absorbed all the tinsel braid
for his own costume, the home-grown warrior
looks a very unimpressive object indeed—some-
thing like a lory parrot which has moulted its
tail
Sydney Govmentouse burst forth into two big
ceremonious balls during race-week, and both
were favored with fine weather. The present
vice-regalities are rather lucky in the matter of
the weather, and rain seldom keeps their guests
indoors trampling on the carpets all the time. I
am told that both balls were a success, which is
mere repetition, since the very fact of being under
the Y.R. roof is enough for Potts Point; though
there were the familiar complaints about the
wrong people going to the first ball. By the
way, a glance down the invitation-lists shows
that the severe Government House clique of
other days must be scattered to the four winds.
I went to hear the boy soprano, Cyril Tyler (the
name of Cyril fits that boy like a silk stocking),
the other evening, and the question I was asking
myself all the time was—what will happen to the
prodigy-show when they put the prodigy into
pants? Cyril, despite his knickerbockers and
Tommy Merton collar, is getting a big boy now ;
he turned 14 (so they say) while in Sydney, and
loses a head-note or two every year. If this sort
of thing is allowed to go on there will soon be not
enough left of the “angelic” little he-soprano
to advertise with. A hulking youth, with a voice
like a cross-cut saw and a fixed determination to
have his pretty hair cut, will be all that is left of
Cyril. At present, however, he is altogether too
lovely for this world. There is on view a picture
of him taken in a surplice, and with the music of
“We Praise Thee, 0 Lord !” in his hands. When
you gaze upon that beatific vision, with the light
shining glorywise on its elaborately-barbered
locks, it never occurs to you, unless you chance
to be a very coarse person indeed, that front-seats
are four shillings.
But perhaps they’ll treat the nicely-Nancyfied
Master Cyril as the horsey people do the ponies,
give him medicated gin to keep him permanently
in the realms of knickerbockers. Even then, if his
screechy voice follows the natural course of all
boys’ voices, the spectacle of a curly-haired cherub
singing in tones akin to the dulcet strains of the
gentleman who offers you 16 bee-nanas in a bag,
will not attract the tribute of nations. Thank
heaven, I haven’t to go through this vale of tears
with a prodigy for my stock-in-trade.
As a soprano vocalist Master Cyril Tyler (who,
in spite of his painted cheeks and an effeminate
gold ring on his “ engaged ” finger, is almost
distinctly a boy) couldn’t fill a tent if he warbled
in long hair and petticoats, for the marvel of his
singing is that it is exactly like a woman’s voice
proceeding out of a curly-haired boy. His man-
nerisms, too —the half-closed eyes, the seductive
smile behind which your average soprano artfully
conceals the fact she is reaching all she knows for
a top-note—are both woman-y, but then he learnt
’em at his mother’s knee, so to speak, for Mrs.
Tyler has a very fresh soprano voice, and her son
has caught her mannerisms (which are, after all,
only mechanisms) to aT. Both Mrs. Tyler (who
travels with her miracle and is a most charming
personality) and Master TVW hail from the Land
of Wooden Hams, and I really must say that it i*
an evil day for Australia that they ever left it.
Because the evil that a prodigy does lives afte
him. Especially a prodigy who has his boudoir
photo, taken in an angelic surplice with an open
psalter in his hand and his eyes turned up with
the devout look of a duck in a thunderstorm, and
then sticks them—l mean the photos.—in every
shop-window on the Block. A posey picture like
that incites every fond mamma whose offspring has
curly hair to grow her monster, so to speak, and
if we aren’t at once flooded out with attitudinising
brats diddling or trickling about on the piano and
squeaking operaticisms d la Tyler, then the
Fauntleroy boom, when every commonplace child
was trained to call his fat and stertorous mama
‘‘dearest,” is no criterion. If Cyril of the odd-
sized voice—which isn’t half so reedily angelic as
the average little freckle-faced chorister’s who
doesn t “get took” in his vestments —if this
Master Cyril came and went and left no after-
math one might receive him as stoically as one
suffers the two-headed calf and other abnormal
things. Why wasn’t the boy-soprano also a freak
on four legs ? Even the proudest parent wouldn’t
want to imitat ethat. Yours truly, Sappho Smith.
Melbourne Confidences.
Melbourne, September 25.
The Urso-Sapio visit gave the Austral Salon a
needed thrill. Thelionesses, after themannerof their
kind, turned up late, keeping everyone on tenter-
hooks, especially the vivacious French hostess, who
aged 10 years in an hour. Alarmists of the “ 1-do-
hope nothing’s-happened ! ” sort are as consoling
to a foreboding heart as those Melbourne girls
who lately, when their dearest friend’s wedding
was postponed, went about saying, “Now that
he’s swerved once, she’ll never get him to face the
flag again ! ”
However, on this occasion, all that tact could de-
vise was done to lighten the suspense. Tea and cake
diverted the attention of Job’s comforters, and a
young lady was put up to sing “ When we meet!’’
an artful allusion to joys in store. When the guests
at last appeared, they were headed straight for a
pair of capacious divan chairs, just the sort of thing
that a young ladies’ work party gives the bachelor
parson for his study, since slippers dropped out of
date. The guardiags of these sacred seats had
nobly earned their afternoon tea, and that’s a
fact. If they nodded for a moment, exhausted
dowagers jumped the claim and looked hurt when
requested as politely as possible to pick up their
parasols and walk. Alter all, the celebrities
declined the thrones, just as Sara Bernhardt did
at Mr. George Coppin’s historic Sunday-night,
and had to be provided for by the hurried eviction
of two adjacent seat-holders.
A patriarchal doctor now ascended the platform
to announce that the Advent was accomplished,
though, had a blind mute been present, he could
have guessed as much from the sudden ferocity
with which his neighbors jostled him and trampled
on his toes. A long, hard stare ensued, and it was
generally agreed that, seen at close quarters,
Mdme. LTrso is the quaintest and snuggest little
dame possible. Her bunny face, beaming through
a white complexion-veil, was surmounted by a
head-dress exactly like the doll’s bonnet achieved
by juvenile milliners. A round of cardboard,
neatly covered with black silk, dotted with pink
rosettes, strings to match, and you have it to a
T. Her striped strawberry silk frock, piped
with black velvet, recalled the party-frocks of our
mothers’ young days (when a white “French
merino,” piped with black velvet, was considered
particularly “chaste.”) The flat sleeves, without
an acorn of shoulder-puff, were insertioned with
narrow black lace. Next to her violin, LJrao’s
salient point is her neck, which amusingly plump
member she certainly doesn’t hide under a bushel.
Encroaching tresses were combed up out of the
way, and the gown collar dipping to a point of
three inches or so at the back allowed a roll of fat
to bulge temptingly above the edges of this V.
Though Mdme. Sapio affected a similar spinal-
cord ventilation, her anatomy did not run so con-
spicuously to natural padding, and was moreover
partially shaded by a feather boa. Unlike her
colleague she was fashionably fixed in black with
picture hat en suite, and looked very imposing.
Her husband comprised the suite, but lie made no
pretence of enjoying himself. His curled-up
moustache-ends give him a fictitiously smiling ex-
pression when, in reality, his countenance is
Sphinx-like.
A prominent devotee was a diminutive matron,
who affects drawing-room elocution and undress,
and is an edition de luxe of the little maid in “ We
are Seven !” She looked so innocent, gazing trust-
fully up at the Goddesses, that it was hard to
realise her the mother of a well-grown urchin. A
small boy, who possesses a parent with short curly
hair, flop hat, blouse frock and knack of infantile
expression twice as artless as his own, must find
her a hard nut to crack.
Mdme, Dejardin wore one of the (numerous
black gowns at the Salon, with a Farisiany bonnet,
consisting chiefly of aigrettes. Marie Elster sported
plenty of cuff and collar, and Hose Blayney, who,
by the way, sang nicely, showed up well in a rose-
trimmed hat.
I hear that the Werribee bride looked her level
best on wedding-day. Probably the conscious-
ness of her great pecuniary renunciation
spiritualised her expression, though, after all, she
was to get the fortune for marrying a title, rather
than for not marrying a commoner. The condi-
tion of the legacy was the capture of a lord, and,
if such was not forthcoming, the dismissal of
plain Jones or Brown wouldn’t have mended
matters.
Society journals dwelt long and lovingly on the
chronicles of this toney wedding, going into
details almost ad nauseam. One read in the
“bridesmaids’ list,’’ “Miss Clarke, daughter of
Mr, and Mrs. Rupert Clarke. ” Surely to good-
ness the fact of two parents goes without saying.
E. Jerome Dyer, editor of “Victoria and its
Resources,” was married last week to Blanche
Lansley, one of Melbourne’s prettiest girls and a
vocalist of exceptional ability.

Tattersall's £100,000 Melbourne Cup
Consultation.
Numerous enquiries have been made as to the
manner in which the drawing for this sweep is
conducted. The plan is this. Marbles numbered
from 1 to 100,000 are placed in a monster barrel
fitted up inside like a churn, the marbles being
subjected to a thorough mixing process. The
names of the horses entered for the race are also
printed on marbles, which are placed in a smaller
barrel. One gentleman is then selected by those
present to draw the horses, while another takes
charge of the barrel containing the numbers, and
the drawing then proceeds. Usually the cash
prizes are dealt with first, the marbles being re-
turned to the barrel after each batch of prizes is
drawn, so that every ticket-holder has several
distinct chances of obtaining different prizes.
The marbles are pulled from the barrel one by one
by gentlemen selected by those present. Then
comes the drawing of the horses. The gentlemen
in charge of the large and small barrel draw each
a marble simultaneously, one with a number and
one with the name of a horse. Names and num-
bers are duly entered by a staff of clerks taken
from the gentlemen present, and the drawing
proceeds until the list of horses is exhausted.
When all is completed, the lists are duly com
pared, checked, signed, and countersigned bj
those assisting ; so that there is no chance of a
mistake being passed over. The drawings now
take place in Brisbane, in the presence of press
representatives and citizens of repute, and every
detail is carried out in the fairest manner possible.
Applications for this year’s big sweep are rapidly
coming in.
The arduous labors of Mr. Tom Furse, the
secretary of Sydney Eight-hour Committee, are
drawing to a close, and on Monday his exertions
will be put to the test. Nothing that could be done
to make this year’s Carnival of Labor as great a
success as, or even greater than, its predecessors
has been left undone. Mr. Furse has worked
night and day for the past three months, and if
anything has been overlooked it won’t be the fault
of this energetic Australian. The benefits
possible of attainment by the purchase of a frugal
eighteen-penny (or even a shilling) ticket are fully
set forth in our business columns.
Wool and Produce Reports.
M‘Burney, Wallis & Co. report:—The wool-sale ol
this week consisted of small catalogues only. Prices
were equal to last auctions. We refrained from offering
wool because it is apparent that the attempt to open this
wool season’s sales in September has been the dismal
failure which has marked similar attempts made prior to
actual commencement of previous seasons. It is un-
doubtedly impossible to sell wool before it is received
|nto store, and even supposing a fair amount to be housed
in Sydney in September, to offer in that month is to place
a producer’s clip before only half the number of buyers as
compared with the purchasing power always present at
our October sales.
The London wool sales have opened with prices up to
best rates of last series for greasy merino, and a 5 per
cent, rise in crossbred. We did not expect to hear of a big
increase in value over the water, because we believe our
own sales, which open on the Bth of next month, will be
the best guide as to the treatment the wool-growers of
our colony are to receive at the hands of buyers in the
ensuing season. Our market has now assumed the proud
position of independence, and must speak for itself. We
have been holding over the clips entrusted to our care,
and early in October will bring forward a large and
attractive catalogue of new wool, which will have the
advantage of being placed before the full buying strength
of the world.
Sydney, Sept. 21st, 1894.
The New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency
Co., Limited, report;—The news from the London wool
sales, which commenced on 18th inst., has been a little
disappointing, less ground than was anticipated having
been gained. So far the advance in prices has been con
fined principally to crossbred wools and scoured sorts ol
merino, and amounts only to about 6 per cent., whereas,
from the tenor of advices received just prior to the com-
mencement of the auctions, it appeared almost certain
that prices would open at an advance of from 5 to 10 per
cent, all round. In this market a fair assortment of new
clip wools—about 4000 bales altogether—has been placed
before the trade during the past week, and, judging by
the business transacted, prices now current here are
about Jd. per lb. below those ruling at a corresponding
time last year for average greasy merino fleece, while
as compared with twelve months ago pieces and other
skirtings, which sold so remarkably well last season, are a
full id. per lb. cheaper. Now that the new clip is being
opened up fully, it is found that the wools vary a good deal
in point of condition, but from the growers’ point of view
the clip, as a whole, will no doubt prove a profitable one;
as there is, in most instances, plenty of yolk in the staple
which, while reducing the value per lb., increases the
weight sold. If anything, the early’ shorn wools appear to
be somewhat heavier in condition than were the first in-
stalments of the preceding clip. This company will hold
their next sale on October 8, when a catalogue of about
2500 biles will be submitted.

SPORTING. NOTIONS.
Of the three-year-olds that performed at the
rtoent Randwick meeting Cobbity may eventually prove
the best, and, next to Moorite, his chance is to be preferred
for the V. 8.0. Derby to that of any other candidate.
» ♦ * *
Kelso must fancy The Captain (still on the big
side) for Caulfield Cup, or he wouldn’t have withdrawn
him from Waverley Handicap—a gift for him at 7st. 41b.
» * * *
When owners pull out their two-year-olds
against horses their seniors in age, it indicates confidence
in the quality of the youngsters’ trials. The only A.J.C.
Derby horse that came well through such an ordeal last
season was Moorite, who, giving a year, beat the brilliant
Hova at even weights, just prior to the latter’s New-
market Handicap victory. This stamps him as an all-
right-one, and as he is said to have made commensurate
improvement from a two to a three year old, his Fleming-
ton chances look rosy.
• * • «
In the writer’s opinion, Tridentine, Ruenalf,
Ohesterman and Ronda are the most dangerous quartette
in Melb. Cup.
* * * «
Gaillardia, the flying daughter of Trenton, will
be the Caulfield Cup mount of clever Chris. Moore, who
may thus get level with his cruel luck (Tim Swiveller’s
disqualification) last year.
♦ * * «
The backers of Lady Trenton and Paris sup-
ported these mokes for tons of money in the face of the
«• chucked-in ” Projectile. This splendidly-bred horse
(Chester-Peroussion) was raced off his legs as a two-year-
old, and gave but one glimpse of his true three-year-old
form; but rest has done him worlds of good, and his easy
Metrop. victory landed his owners from £15,000 to £20,000
•n bets.
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
On the Metrop. running, Oxide, Paris, Nightin-
gale, Lady Trenton and Loyalty should be close together
when Melb. Cup is run ; but though a probable winner
■nay not be among the quintette, the writer does predict
that Loyalty will be nearer than any of the other four.

If the Melb. Cup is to go to the Sydney side of

Reversals of form and the downing of favorites
bad, no doubt, much to do with the small attendance at
Randwick on the concluding day, Saturday last, of the
A.J.C. Meeting. The day opened disastrously for backers
by Hopscotch winning the High Weight Handicap, for
which Milkmaid was heavily backed down to 3 to 1.
Reconstruction, at 8 to 1, won the Members’ Handicap
from the much backed Cobbitty and Atlas; and then
Mutiny put backers in a bit better humor by winning the
Second Steeplechase, tor which He started an equal
favourite with Grandwing. Oxide was picked upon as
the most likely for the Waverley Handicap, but he faded
to run into a place, and the winner turned up in Nightin-
gale. Patron started an even-money favorite for the
Randwick Plate, but when it came to finishing Chester-
man wore him down and won by four lengths. What
money the public had left they planked on Bungehah for
the Final Handicap, but it was not to be, as the places
were filled by Carnation, Loyalty and Albercore, although
it was not till the last 50 yards that Bungebah’s backers
were put out of their misery.
* * * *
Shotbolt (Newminster —Brunette) is getting on
nicely at Ballarat. This horse will run well in whichever
race Scobie advises he should be spun. His probable
journey—Caulfield Cup.
* * * *
Ohesterman, in the Caulfield at fist. 71b., and in
the Melbourne Cup at 6st. 81b., is as likely a double as we
have had for many a day.
• * * *
The result of the A.J.C. Meeting would indi-
cate that age has told on the three cracks, Marvel, Paris
and Bungebah, Oxide, too, has lost his old-time dash.
* * * *
Many hold that the thoroughbred is as good as
ever he’ll be at three years, and they want the w.f.a. scale
revised accordingly. Certainly, Loyalty at the A.J.C.
showed no improvement on his running of last year.
* * » «
Many jockeys now think thatßill ” Long’s
proposal re fees would, if carried, benefit them. For
instance, the winning rider in the Epsom, supposing the
prize to be £lOOO, would then get £55, whereas he is now
entitled only to £5.
• * » *
One prominent Sydney penciller volunteered to
act as private detective against cash-bettors in the pad-
dock, during the A.J.C. meeting. Cash-betting, despite
the objections of certain interested people, is preferable
to the other system on the principle of being the smaller
of two evils.

six months, while several other cronks were fortunate
enough to pass unnoticed.

lenging Fitzsimmons. But he is mistaken in asserting
that Fitz. cannot fight strong at list. 41b.
* * * *
On July 28, Fitzsimmons added Kellar to his
ast of victims. Fitz. allowed Kellar to make play in the
first round, but no sooner was time called for the second
than Fitz. strode over to his opponent’s corner and smote
him on “ the point” with the right. It took three doctors
15min. to bring Mr. Kellar round.

George Giffen says his real reason for deserting
the Norwoods was because, among other outrages, they
even refused to elect him an Association delegate, thus
shutting him out of the Cricket Council. Giffen certainly
has much to complain of, considering what he has done
f or S.A. cricket.

Brookwell, the young Surrey batsman and

most to do with the success or failure of Stoddart’s

in Blackham’s sneerful remark that if Richardson were

Robert Buchanan, poet, playwright, novelist,
and philosopher, owned up in his recent bankruptcy
schedule to having lost £l2OO by backing horses. A
serious Scotch bard fossicking after something “straight
from the stable ”is a painful subject for reflection. One
would scarcely be more shocked by the discovery that
Swinburne had just advised Ruskin to have a bit on Billy-
goat for the Welter Handicap if Snooks weighs out for the
mount.
“Not One”; “I would like The Bulletin
contributor to give a little detail over his slapdash state-
ment that the veteran bookmaker almost invariably goes
wrong. With a pretty wide knowledge of the craft, Ido
no* hear of one unrespectable man who has not been
regarded as such all his life. On the other hand, please
let me cite such plain individuals as the Thompsons,
Joseph, Goyder, Gienister, and a score of others that
rise to the lips ; some lucky, some not, but all cashy."

Dear Bulletin, —The scarcity of old book-
makers is accounted for by the nature of their calling.
There is not one bookmaker in a thousand who, even
though he lead an abstemious life, can endure the mental
excitement of six races a day, day after day and week
after week, for a long stretch of years. The men,
especially the Christians among them, break down in
their minds as the horses ultimately go cronk in their
legs. It is a common expression at London betting clubs,
“ Poor So-and-so has broken down.” Bookmakers become
paralysed pretty freely. A lot of them die insane. Davis,
the first layer of odds to be called a leviathan, lived 20
years, or more, of lonely life in his house at Brighton
(Eng.), refusing to see any of his old friends. His legs
were completely paralysed. His mind was diseased. He
had broken down.— Punter.
• * • *
Nothing more forcibly illustrates the extent of
Melbourne’s depression than the presence of a book-
maker’s bag, name and all, in a pawnshop window.

Goddard is to meet Quigley, October 22, In his
ancient form, the Barrier man should win easily, but he is
comparatively old and his recent defeats by Maori Laing
and the Yankee Englishman, E. Smith, are ominous. He
may, however, overpower Quigley in the first few rounds,
and then would want to tackle his old opponent, Mick
Dooley.
* * • •
The residents of Randwick complain of the
stench and want the local graveyard closed. It’s not the
dead men—it’s the stiff horses on the course.

The provision in the Tasmanian Tate Act to ex-
tend the use of the machine to regattas and axemen’s con-
tests is distinctly good. What nice cronk running there
would be if it were applied to pedestrianism 1 No one
would win unless he was paying a good div.

Dear Bulletin, —How does this strike you?
Adelaide had a race-meeting the other Saturday, and the
totalisator investments for six races were:—
No. 1 .. .. £946 0 0
„ 2 .. .. 1569 10 0
„ 3 .. „ 1935 10 0
„ 4 ~ .. 1989 0 0
„ 5 .. .. 1583 0 0
„ 6 .. ... 1882 0 0
Total, £9905 0 0
Commission, £990 10s.; Average investment, £1650.
Now, the machine, unlike the bookmaker, is on a strictly
cash basis. It takes no risks and makes no bad debts.
Suppose the racing public of Sydney start a four days’
meeting, six races each day, totalisator legalised. If
the available betting capital to start with is, say,
£BOOO, the machine takes 10 per cent, of it six
times a day, and the whole of the money would
be practically all gone on the second day—that
is, if they were mugs enough to bet their whole strength.
With an average of, say, £5OOO on each race they would
be clean broke some time on the third day. Now, I think
that if the Anti-Betting League wants to suppress
gambling it should get the totalisator in, then we won’t
have any money to bet with. No wonder it is killing
racing in Maoriland. Monte Carlo is not a patch on the
innocent machine. I have had no experience of its work-
ing in any way, but the figures quoted in the Adelaide
papers have given me the nightmare. I wish I were a
totalisator.—Yours everlastingly, Herod.
• • • •
Statesman Buckley on the Gaming Bill in Maori-
land Leg. Council: “I have been astonished to find that
at one of the Maori race-meetings to which a totalisator
peimitwas granted, the ‘plate’ offered was 2s. 6d. and
two boxes of matches!”
♦ • ♦ •
Dear Bulletin, —“Trooper” is right in stating
the absurdity of applying English drill to Australian
Volunteers,” for the very simple reason that the average
“Australian Volunteer ” sits his horse, but does not ride
it. Good riding in Australia is generally recognised not
so much by the “ perfect balance of the horse ” as by the
rider’s power of "sticking on.” As regards the “horses
sent from cavalry regiments for no fault except that the
would not keep the ranks this may have happened, but
is certainly the exception, not the rule. The difficulty
generally is to persuade the average horse to leave the
ranks at all; and most assuredly any horse that bolted
“at a charge” and left the ranks, would subject its rider
to an unlimited term of extra riding-school for “awkward
riding.”—Yours, &0., Hussar.
* • * •
Editor Bulletin.— You are wrong in your
theory that “in a warm climate the thorough-
bred is reverting to the Arab.” Which Arab?
The Nejdi Arab, which is regarded as the best,
and cannot be bought for money, is a little weight-carrier
from 14 to 15 hands, with immense bone, and great thick
shoulders and haunches. The next best strain of Arab
blood, that of Jibl Shomer, in Central Arabia, often pro-
duces large and powerful horses up to 16 hands. In
Hadramat, in the extreme south of Arabia, there is
a breed of black horses running over 16 hands. Bruce,
the Abyssinian traveller, who stood 6ft. 6in. in his stock-
ings, and was built in proportion, rode a big Dongola
horse, which was quite up to his enormous weight. I
mvself ride 15 stone, and some years ago I used to ride a
little “Gulf” Arab barely 14 hands, that I bought in
India for 20 rupees—about £2 at the time. He was only
a little mongrel, but he could gallop easily with my
weight, and once carried me 80 miles in a day without
absolute distress. Nearly all the Arab horses that find
their way to India are similar mongrels imported from
Bushir by dealers. The best-looking of them are palmed
off on the unwary, by means of forged pedigrees, as Nejdi
horses. The Nejdi Arab regards these pedigrees with
scorn.—R.

Dear Bulletin, —Ladas’ defeat by Throstle, in
the Doncaster St. Leger, spoils Rosebery’s triple crown.
The Town Moor has carried more surprises than any race-
course in existence, and Yorkshiremen all over the
world prefer (from experience) a long shot for the Leger
to a red-hot “certainty." I backed Throstle (by letter),
in England, at 40 to 1, last July, partly because Capt.
Machell (the modern wizard of the English turf) fancied
him, and partly because my youngster suffered from
thrush (the bird is called throstle in Yorkshire) at the time
that Ladas won his Derby. It may interest your many
Yorkshire readers to know that I, a Doncaster man,
backed Caller 'Ou when she beat Kettledrum for the
Leger at 100 to 1, Lord Olifden at 40 to 1, Achievement
(Hermit’s conqueror) at 24 to 1, Apology (supposed to
be dead lame) at 50 to 1, and Dutch Oven at 40 to 1, when
she beat Geheimniss in this race.—Yours, Borisonia.

Joe Thompson has quite deserted the English
racecourse for the more placid, if not so congenial, occu-
pation of turf commission-agent. He is quartered at 59
Jermyn-street, and appears to have a good clientele.
His office is quite a rendezvous for Australians. He is
looking very aged, and has changed much during the last
two years, ever since a severe attack of influenza. Brother
Barney is, of course, his right-hand man. The whilom
Adonis of the ring is now as bare of thatch as a billiard-
ball. Joe complains that English “ swells ”do not pay
up as promptly as Australian gentlemen.

The Bulletin has already noted that pigeon-

The Johnsonian Club, Brisbane, which had of

give honorary membership to another football team.

Dear Sir, — I think it my duty to inform you

Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform
you that a course of your Alfaline Pills com-
pletely cured me of a severe case of biliousness,
wind and nervousness. I may also mention
that several of my friends to whom I have
recommended your remedies have derived great
benefit from them; therefore, I consider you
are deserving of success, which I do most
heartily wish you.—Yours gratefully,

BI THE USE OE
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mrs. M. A. GUMMING,
of Yarravllle, Victoria, Australia, says s
« About a year ago, I had a severe attack
of Influenza, which left me very weak, with-
out energy, appetite, or interest in life.
Obtaining little or no relief from doctors, or
from the many remedies recommended to
me, I finally tried Ayer’s Sarsaparilla and.
&
from that time, I began to gain health and
strength. I continued the treatment until
fully recovered, and now have very great
pleasure in telling my friends of the merits
of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, and the happy re-
sults of its use. I consider it the best blood-
purifier known.” • ,

Itching Skin Humors
Torturing \ Disfiguring Eczemas
And every species of itching, burning, bleeding, scaly, crusted, pimply,
and blotchy skin and scalp diseases are relieved in the majority
of cases by a single application, and speedily, permanently and
economically cured by the Cuticura
Remedies when the best physicians,
hospitals, and all other remedies fail.
No language can exaggerate the suf-
fering of those afflicted with these dis-
eases, especially of little babies, whose
tender skins are literally on fire.
CUTICURA
Remedies are the greatest skin
cures, blood purifiers, and humor reme-
dies of modern times, are absolutely
pure, and agreeable to the most sensi-
tive, and may be used on the youngest
infant and most delicate invalid with
gratifying and unfailing success.
Cuticura, the great skin cure, instantly allays
the most intense itching, burning, and inflamma-
tion, permits rest and sleep, heals raw and irri-
tated surfaces, cleanses the scalp of crusts and scales, and restores the hair. Cuticura
Soap, the only medicated toilet soap, is indispensable in cleansing diseased surfaces.
Cuticura Resolvent, the new blood and skin purifier and greatest of humor reme-
dies, cleanses the blood of all impurities, and thus removes the cause. Hence, the
Cuticura Remedies cure every humor of the skin, scalp, and blood, with loss of hair.
JBS5=-“How to Cure Diseases of the Skin and Blood, ”64 pages, 300 Diseases, 50 Illus-
trations, 100 Testimonials, is wrapped around every bottle of the Cuticura Resolvent.
Cuticura Remedies are sold throughout the world. Price, Cuticura. 50c.; Cuticura soap,
25c.; Cuticura Resolvent, si. Prepared by Potter Drug & Chemical Corp’n, Boston, U. o. A.
red, rough hands, painful finger ends and shapeless nails
are prevented and cured by Cuticura Soap, in-
comparably the greatest of skin purifiers and beautifiers,
while rivalling in delicacy and surpassing in purity the most expensive of toilet and nursery soaps-
The only medicated toilet soap and the only preventive and cure of inflammation and clogging o£

Rumoured that Russia is negotiating for
the purchase of most of the Portuguese colonies,
including Goa in Hindostan and Timor, East
Indies. If this is so the band will begin to play
shortly.
“ Man,” says J. A. Balfour, the coercionist
politician and philosopher, “is no longer the final
cause of the universe, the heaven-descended heir
of all the ages. His very existence is an accident, his
history a brief and discreditable episode in the life
of one of the meanest of the planets.”
St. Stead, in last Review, says that since
the publication of “Maiden Tribute” lots of
women bothered about sex questions have looked
upon him as a kind of glorified father confessor.
This is the most joyous position that a dirty saint
can possibly wish for. Only such a one is privi-
leged to say, as Stead does in his Chicago book,
that “Few people realise that a young and pretty
woman can make more money for a time, by what
may be called a discriminate sale of her person,
than the ablest woman in America can make at
the same age in any other profession.”
The Vic. railway revenue this year is on
an average .£5OOO a month below that of ’93, and
’93 was no one knows how many thousands below
’92, and ’92 and ’9l showed the same big drop
compared with their predecessors. Yet the last
three budgets have been based on the assumption
that Victoria was at last “round the corner.”
What the province wants now is a weeping pessi-
mist for its Treasurer, who will assume that the
province will never get round the corner again,
and frame his budget accordingly. Victoria is
sick of hopeful politicians.
Randolph Bedford hurled his eloquence at
an election-meeting the other night as a free and
independent candidate for a Melb. constituency
that he had never attempted to canvass and where
he knew nobody except himself. Randolph's
vigorous Republicanism was finding him some
friends, when, by a ghastly slip of the tongue—of
course—he proclaimed his devotion to Freetrade,
instead of Protection. That was fatal. He apolo-
gised for having so grossly libelled his fixed prin-
ciples, but the meeting laughed a loud, discordant
laugh. They set him down as a Bloated Mono-
polist with a leaning towards anarchy, and
although he cursed Patterson like a good ’un the
electors couldn’t get away from the fact that he
had written short stories for the A.EGUS. Conse-
quently, Randolph withdrew his candidature, a
much-misunderstood journalist. But a time will
come.
Talmage on the Tarawera (M.L.) eruption :
It seemed as if all the hyenas of rage were snarling at
all the flamingoes of beauty. The lake hissed as with ten
thousand serpents when the hot bombs of the mountain
dropped into it. The malodors of burning iron oxides
and magnesia and chlorine and alumina and sulphur
filled all the regions approximate with suffocation,
Strangulation and asphyxia.
The lurid one then jproceeds to describe an Aus-
tralian sunrise:—
The whole sky first took on a pallor, not sickly, but
healthful, as though there were white wings from
the other side shining through. Then there came corusca-
tions, and deep indigoes, and irradiations, and sadnesses of
color, and unrolling scrolls prophetic of more light, and
sombre and holy gleams and rhapsodies of advancing
day ; and then, banners of victory over the darkness.
Then in this wall of Heaven the gates began to swing
open. It was no sudden swinging back of the panels of
fire. There was no grinding of the gates on the
amethystine hinges ; there was no clang of bolts hurled
back from the Imperial portals, but a slow, gradual and
overpowering movement that made me feel there was
more to come, and I wondered if 1 could endure the ex-
panding vision.
An aggressive Melb. potentate, known to
fame as the architect of his own hat, was the other
morning sitting next the door of the omnibus which
serves his own particular suburb and which was
then full to the regulation number of eleven,
when a stranger got in out of the wet. “ Can you
make room for one, gentlemen?” diffidently
enquired the newcomer. The gentlemen-mostly
middle-aged grandees, who regard the ’bus as
their own especial property—didn’t seem at all
inclined to make room and the potentate, afore-
said, who was reading a book as he sat on the
end of the seat near the door, glowered ferociously,
and looking round for approval said with mock
sweetness : “Perhaps, you would like to take my
seat, sir,” and suiting the action to the word he
stood up. Whereupon the stranger did take his
seat and the architect of his own hat making a
false step, fell out into the mud with great violence.
Then the stranger looking round the ’bus for
approval said, pointing to the potentate, engaged
in straightening out his hat and wiping the mud
off his hinder parts: “Gentlemen, sarcasm is
sometimes its own reward.”
CONSIDER THE LILIES.
“ He did not profess to be a saint, but he had lived for
over 40 years in that district and thought he might fairly
claim that he was as good as most people, and if not
better than the two parsons who got up to speak about
him, he would hang himself.”— The Victorian Speaker at
Brighton (Melb.).
Three cheers for Bent, the Speaker bloke 1
So ’elp me ! he’s a boomer :
He’s game to take the floor, an’ choke
A narsty lyin’ rumour;
He doesn’t want no coat o’ paint
To make him look the whiter,
He don’t pretend to be a saint,
But Gawd knows he’s a fighter.
Tom’s lived in Brighton forty year,
And, as yer know, he’s Speaker,
And when he fills the bloomin’ chair
There’s none looks more uniquer.
Yer ’eard them parson chaps condemn
His morals—they was dreamin’.
If Rent was not as good as them
He’d ’ang hisself, like Deemin’.
It just amounts to this—he’s Bent,
The Mercantile Financer;
Ain’t he the boy for Parlyment?
In course he is, I answer ;
He’s done a ’eap for this here place,
And when I treats him coolly—
Well, smash me with the missin’ mace,
And send the bits to Moule.

HOW A LOT OF MONEY LEAKS OUT.
What does a man do when he finds a hole in the
pocket where he carries his money ? Anybody
can answer that question. He has it sewed up, of
course, directly—and good and strong, too. I
Suppose it is with you just as it is with me. When
1 spend money, even foolishly, I can tell where it
went, and maybe I’ve had some sort of pleasure
out of it. But I do mortally hate to lose money;
lose it out and out, you know, and have no satis-
faction from it, or know how or when it left my
possession.
Well, now, let me show you the worst and biggest
hole any man ever had in his pocket; a hole
that lets the cash leak away like water through a
sieve, a hole that is the hardest in the world to
sew up. A short story will show it best,
“ Drummore South Cottage,
“ Musselburgh, near Edinburgh,
“September 16th, 1891.
“ Gentlemen, —Up to 1885 I was always strong
and healthy. About this time I began to feel bad.
I was tired, languid, dull, and listless, and every-
thing was a burden to me. I had no desire for
company, and what had come over me I could not
make out. My tongue and mouth were dry, and
I had a deal of phlegm on my stomach. The
whites of my eyes next became discolored and my
skin was yellow. I had no appetite, and after
eating I had great pain at my chest and sides, also
across my stomach. After a time the pain settled
in my left side, and my heart would beat and
jump in a manner that alarmed me. By-and-by I
got so weak that I was not able to go about the
house, and I felt that I ought to be in bed. The
pains at my side and stomach became so bad that
I had to remove my clothing (everything seemed
so tight), and I used to press my stomach and
hold my sides to try and ease the pain. Getting
worse, I saw a doctor at Musselburgh, and was
under him for three months, but his medicine
gave me no relief. After this I went to a clever
doctor at Preston Pans who said I was suffering
from indigestion and dyspepsia. He sent to
London for some celebrated medicine which was
packed in small phials. This medicine seemed to
dissolve my food, and I felt easier for a time, but
I gained no strength or real benefit, and after per-
severing with his treatment for six months, I
gave it up and fell into my old state. I next
went to a doctor at Musselburgh, but all his
medicines did me no good. After this I saw
another doctor (that is a fourth doctor), but with
the same result; none of them gave me anything
that reached my complaint. I now lost all faith
in physic, for I had spent a deal of money and
taken so much medicine ‘ that I lost all my teeth
through it ’ and was no better for it. In great
misery I lingered on month after month, always
ailing, when in August of last year (1890), my
husband called at Mr. Jack’s Drug Stores, High-
street, Fisherrow, and told him what my condition
was. Mr. Jack gave him an account of the
wonderful cures he heard of from many of his
customers that had taken a medicine called
Seigel’s Syrup, and strongly recommended him to
bring me a bottle. He did so, and I commenced
taking the Syrup, and I found some relief from
the first bottle, and by the time I had taken four
bottles I was as well and strong as ever I was in
my life, and have since kept in good health. I tell
every one what Seigel’s Syrup has done for me,
‘ I never thought to get better again, and I con-
sider it has saved ray life. I wish others to know
this, and if by publishing this statement it will be
the means of helping others, as it helped me, you
can use this letter as you like. Yours truly
(Signed) Jemima Watson.”
Look back to about the middle of the above
letter and again read what the writer says: “I
had spent a deal of money for medicine.” Yes,
and money she could poorly afford to spare. Ill-
ness and the expense of illness is the great hole in
the pocket that I alluded to. It costs so much,
and what does it give us in return ? Pain, weari-
ness, and misery. There is another consideration
besides. When we are ill we not only have to
bear the increased outgo, but manage to meet
larger demands out of a decreased income. Our
candle is burning at both ends. “Yes,” you say,
“ but how can we keep from falling ill ?” You
cannot always, but in view of the fact that most
illnesses arises from indigestion and dyspepsia, a
timely use of Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup will
prevent it. A few shillings thus invested will
save pounds in money and perhaps months of
wretchedness. Think over the striking points in
Mrs. Watson’s excellent letter and you will think
the same.

Dear Bulletin, — I am a road-maker em-
ployed by contractors under Govt, on the N.S.W.
South Coast. From Cooma and Monaro to Eden,
and from Eden to Bateman’s Bay, nearly all
contractors keep boarding-houses. A contractor
will not employ you unless you stop at his board-
ing-house. The charge is 15s. to 16s. per week
for tucker only (sleep in your own tent). Prices
for other requisites : tobacco, 6s. per lb. ; bar of
soap, Is. ; matches, 9d. doz., and so on. Contracts
are cut very fine now, and it seems to me all the
profit is made out of board. I can board myself
easily for 7s. or Bs. a week. Why should Ibe
compelled to truck my wages to a Govt, contractor?
Men on piece average about 4s. a day when work-
ing, and day men not much more. Consequence
is, when the contractor’s bill is settled, we take
the road again just about as poor as when we
started the job.—Yours, Roadman.
A late pastor of a very old Melbourne
Anglican Church had some queer parishioners,
amongst them a neighbouring hotelkeeper, who,
though he paid pew-rent and so on, never attended
church. When ill almost unto death, the eldest
son waited upon the Rev. B with a view that
he should visit the dying man and prepare him
for the long journey. The clergyman hesitated.
Said he: “Your father is a peculiar man. No
doubt he subscribes liberally to this church and he
has several times supplied new ropes for the bells,
of which I approve; he also supplies the ringers
with free beer, of which I do not approve, although
I understand the beer is good. But he does not
believe. You know the Scripture says that ‘he
that hath believed and hath fallen away ’ is con-
demned to hell fire.” “But,” interrupted the
son, “my father never did believe, so that that
cannot apply to him.” “Ah, well,” replied the
parson, “ that point might save him, but I don’t
know—anyhow, I’ll see him.” And he did.

The sheep-dog trial at last Corowa,
N.S.W., show, characterised by its sedate sancti-
moniousness and absence of all naughty language,
was a striking contrast to the one of four years
ago. Then, thqse engaged in attending to the
dogs were not particular as to the phrases they
used in addressing them, so, “for the sake of
common respectability,” the committee were com-
pelled to prohibit all strong language in the en-
closure. This was a poser for some of the shep-
herds, whose dogs understood nothing but thunder-
ing curses, but all went well, until one dog, utterly
astonished at the mild and pious tone assumed by
his master, “sat down ” and looked up in his face
in amazement, allowing the sheep to scatter over
the ring. This was too much for the pent-up
feelings of the gentle shepherd, who, turning
savagely round, called out: “Say, judge, can I
call my dog a blanky blank ?” and then, without
waiting for a reply, shook his fist at the dog and
bellowed out : “ Well, you are a blank
blanked blanky , , , fool 1” He did
not win the competition with his unregenerate
beast. All this year’s dogs were saintly animals
and every one possessed a Sunday-school cer-
tificate.

It is commonly reported that the Maoriland
Government will buy up most of the B.N.Z.’simmense dead
weight of landed property, and subdivide it into small
farms. If it does this, a whole lot of big estates will be
broken up, and the ultimate benefit to the people will be
very great. The only serious difficulty is the question of
price. If the estates are bought at their hook value, no
one can say exactly where the Government will be. And
if they are bought at their present market value, it is
hard to say where the bank will be.

Until N.S.W. Civil Service Superannuation
Fund is used for insuring the lives of those who contribute
to it—and not merely, as now, for supplying pensions to
civil-servants over 60 years, and compensation to those
retrenched-it will remain a snare and a delusion to a
large body of civil-servants who are compulsorily sub-
scribers to a fund already bankrupt, from which the
greater number of them can never hope to reap any
benefit. The old, crippled mother of the young lady-
teacher, lately killed at a Newcastle railway-station, can-
not claim one cent of the money regularly deducted from
her daughter’s cheque, and paid into this fraudulent fund;
and as an aggravaiion of the hardship in this particular
case, the deceased lady was the mother’s sole support.

“It is reported that the trust accounts of pro-

dition,” says the Sydney Telegraph’s correspondent.
The accounts of prominent solicitors in general have a
tendency that way. The Bulletin knows one man who
is lying in bed at his hotel because his prominent solicitor
collected his divs. last year and hasn’t accounted for them
yet. He is staying in bed because he reckons that the
-sordid hotelkeeper won’t fire him out in an undressed
state, and he has the bed drawn close up to the window
so that he can look out every few minutes to see if his
money is coming. Yes, the trust accounts of a good

condition indeed,

prise, by cutting off the developer’s middleman profit and

The B.H. mine-owners, after the strike, two
years ago, instituted a comprehensive system of boycott
under which it was decreed, amongst other things, that
the local weekly smelting-yields, formerly available at the
mine offices, should be withheld from the local labor
organ. The boycotted journal at once arranged to have
the yields wired from Adelaide, and published them as
usual, to the no small disgust of the mines people. All
the mines save the Proprietary have now suspended local
smelting, but the boycott is still in force, and the journal
is still under the necessity of procuring the yields of the
mine, which are published as local news, from Adelaide.

Some legal questions arose the other day con-

died a few years ago while there was still “confidence” in

directed that it should be invested in “ shares of any
bank or banking co., or gas co., or bonds or debentures
of any other co., or deposits in or with any bank or bank-
ing co.” It seems strange to reflect that there actually
was a time when sane Victorians left wills like that.

The New Chum Railway mine at Bendigo has a

mations will go right down to the centre of the earth—or
right down to Tophet, as the case may be. The biggest

Editor Bulletin, — In your issue of Bth Sept., I
noticed a par as follows: “Another life is said to have
been given to Baker’s Creek mine by a recent discovery.
What was thought to be a blank piece of ground is found
to contain the lode, and a great quantity of backs are
now ready for working—that is the story, anyhow." In
re this, I should like to ask the company why they opened
a London office lately, and if it is a fact that fully a
quarter of the shares are now held in London? Why,
then, this unloading? I should like the shareholders
residing away from the field to know what manner of life
this celebrated mine is likely to have in the future. This
new find is nothing more nor less than the old run of gold
that was lost through not working past the pinch caused by
the hard bar which exists between the Nos. 3 and 7 levels.
In No. 8 level the co. has had kind, easy country to work,
thus showing that they are only now getting into settled
country, being between 400 and 500 ft. below the bed of
the creek. In this level they met with the “ other life ”
(so-called) 200 ft. from their S.E. boundary dipping fast
away from them towards the No. 1 Extended property.
Fact is. Baker’s Creek mine has only had the cap of this
wonderful shoot of gold, which they are losing fast, and
upon which their divs. are said to depend. “The great
quantity of backs” won’t last 12 months if all is true wo
hear, because of the depth and sharp dip of the shoot (it
having dipped 75ft. in the 100 between Nos. 7 and 8 levels),
and the nearness of the boundary when first met with.
“The other life” rather belongs to the other claim, as
should be proved in a short time. The Baker’s O. mine
would have had a much longer lease of life if she had
been worked economically from the start, as there isn’t
another mining township in N.S.W. with such facilities
as Hillgrove for aheap motive power. The Fails are
1500 ft. deep, and with a battery at the bottom and a dam
on top the crushing could have been done for about a
sixth of what it has cost, leaving out the cost of engines
and boilers, and the wear and tear, to say nothing of the
staff of engineers, mechanics and laborers that the.un-
necessary machinery necessitates. —Yours, Miner, Hill-
grove, Sept. 11, 1894.

Dear Bulletin, —Hav6 you ever noticed
a water-color picture (No. 306 in the_ catalogue) in
the water-color court of N.S.W. National Gallery?
It is entitled “A Venetian Peasant,” by L.
Da Rios. How did this shameless peasant
succeed in forcing her way into the gallery and
escaping the Social Purity Society’s searching
eye (I presume “ L. Hop.” has warrant for draw-
ing them with only one searching eye)? Are we
to assume that this is the average condition of a
Venetian peasant of the female sex ? Or are all
Venetian female peasants similarly situated ? If
this is the chronic condition of the Venetian
peasantry, then Venice must be a very populous
city. Judging by the absence ot any sign of a
ring on the third finger of this brazen creature’s
left hand, I should say that the Venetian
peasantry do not give the registrar of marriiages
much trouble. I saw several elderly mar-
ried ladies looking very anxiously at this
picture, muttering “ Poor thing i” and, on the
whole, one finds oneself thinking of godfathers and
godmothers, and looking eagerly for Sairey Gamp
in the middle distance. What can the trustees
have been doing to permit this distinctly immoral
drawingtoenterN.S. Wales National Gallery? And
where is the Social Purity Society? Surely its
members could spare a day now and then from
the divorce-court to look this shameless Venetian
patient up, and see that she is either removed
from the walls, for about a month, or provided
with proper medical: attendance. At at events,
young people under 50 or so should not be per-
mitted to see this singular example of the state of
morals in the Gity of Venice.^—Yours, Social
Pukitt.
Writes the National”: “Magazine-news-
papers are the best to advertise in. An advertisement
which is not read does no good, and most daily papers are
only half read before they make way for their successors.
The paper that is read from end to end,” like The Bulle-
tin, “is the sheet-anchor of profitable advertising.” A
good, original weekly, not a hideous jumble of reprinted
stale news spiced with observations about horse-colio and
turnip-diseases, is the best medium. Every man knows
that he skims over a daily, at breakfast or on a tram-car.
He never reads it through. But his favorite weekly is
mentally laid aside lor an hour of leisure, and then he
reads it, and reads it right through. The Bulletin cir-
culates everywhere in Australasia, and even sells 300
copies weekly in South Africa. Let the business man
personally observe, or ask his traveller or his travelling
friend to keep his eyes open and say which paper is the

The Price of a Kiss .
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
Where the ranges dip down to the plain at their
base,
In the lap of the gully lies “ Tressider’s Place,”
And the danoers are footing it merry and bright
For the honour of Kitty, his daughter, to-night.
With a clatter of hoofs and a jingle of belts
The troopers ride up and the merriment melts,
And men stand aghast, who were laughing before,
At the glitter of steel, as they crowd to the door.
Tom Govan, long-hunted, is captured at last,
And the days of his riding and raiding are past;
They bring him, a prisoner, half-ended their task,
And to rest there the night is the favour they ask.
In the stable they lash him to post and to ring.
For the strength of his arm is a marvellous thing,
Then they join in the dance and the night wanes
apace,
And there's laughing and loving at “ Tressider’s
Place.”
But Kitty creeps out and stands weeping apart,
For the love of Tom Govan that lies at her heart.
For in good and in evil, through sin and through
shame.
The love of a woman alone is the same.
But a form is beside her, a voice at her ear,
The voice that of all she least wishes to hear—
’Tis the trooper who first ran her lover to earth,
And whoso love she had treated with scorning and
mirth.
“Kate,” he whispers, “to-night bid your lover
good-bye,
If he leaves here to-morrow Tom Govan will die,
But just smile on me kindly and give me one kiss,
And to prove how I love you I’ll give you—see—
this I”
He holds up his hand and he shows her a key—
One turn in the lock and Tom Govan is free—
He would barter his honour, with traitors claim
kin,
For one smile from the woman he never can win.
She falters a moment, then raises her face.
Puts her hand in his own—“ You may kiss me,”
she says.
“When you’re both far away,” and he toys with
her hair,
“ You might give me a thought—if you’ve any to
spare.”
• * •
There is saddling and mounting at “Tressider’s
Place,”
For of Tom and bis sweetheart no man finds a
trace—
But One lies on the grass, a revolver he grips,
And ’tis the smile he bought, maybe, that’s still
on his lips.

ELISE ESPINASSE.
The utter puerility of some Queensland
Separationists was never more strikingly shown
than when certain of the clan gravely requested
Max O’Rell to use his influence to forward the
Separation movement on his return to England.
Blouet gravely assured them that he would lay
the case immediately before the crowned heads of
Europe.
His Hair.
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
The little albino barber was quite a show feature
of that small Maoriland township. He was about
39, unmarried, and without a solitary love-experi-
ence, when one morning a girl stepped into his
saloon.
“ Can you trim my hair, barber?” she asked.
“Not this morn in’. Miss. I’d ’ave t’ shut th’
room ter gents to do it; but if you’ll come ut two-
thirty I’ll be ’appy t’ oblige yer.”
He had all ready when she returned. Envelop-
ing her in a pink wrapper, he let loose the coils of
jet black hair, which, as he lightly shook their
strands apart, fell about his feet in a profusion of
glossy ripples. With a smothered exclamation he
stood back for a moment, his pink expressionless
eyes growing redder-rimmed, his placid features
working with delight in the spectacle before him—■
so unique, so utterly unexpected.
“ I want you to cut a good deal of it off,” she
said ;“itis so heavy. And she sighed wearily.
The usually communicative barber did not reply.
He brushed and combed the wonderful hair, fin-
gering it as though it were of spun glass; then
began to clip.
“You are to take off quite six inches,” she
ordered.
Snick! snick ! the frizzy black fragments piled
into quite a little heap at the albino’s feet, but
still those raven tresses swept the floor.
“Thank you,” she said, when he had lifted and
re-coiled that ebon crown ; “Ishall work with less
sense of oppression now that you have lightened
my load,” and, smiling, she paid her shilling and
went out.
Twice during that summer she came again to
have her hair cut. At the beginning of the cold
weather she came for the fourth time.
“ It’s ’ardly necessary t’ cut any more off,” the
albino objected, caressing the falling hair, which
now hung some inches from the floor.
“Oh, yes! I simply cannot bear the weight;
take off a good length ; it’s too much, such a mass
of hair.” And she settled herself in the big chair,
her small face reflected in the mirror.
The albino saw not the face; his thoughts were
all of that glorious hair —his heart’s first love.
Small and few were the locks he severed ; but
for over an hour he brushed and smoothed, till the
blue-black polish reflected the movement of his
broad, flat-nailed fingers, while she, dozing, noted
not how time passed. Customers were clamoring
for entrance when, with a heavy sigh of regret, he
drew away the wrapper.
“I’m afraid I’ve kept you a long time, but
you’ve taken away my headache,” she said, grate-
fully.
“ ’Eadache! Do you ’ave ’em ?”
“ Almost all the time. I’ll come again soon to
have it charmed away.”
“ I ’ope you will. I’m always free early after-
noons. Yes, I ’ope you will,” repeated the albino,
not looking at her, but speaking to the hair.
She passed out into the street, and met her
headache at the first step on the rude pavement.
The albino, on his knees, carefully gathered
every hair from the sheet he had spread to receive
them as they fell; and placed the gleanings in a
little screw of silver paper upon a shelf among
several similar parcels.
After a month the weather set in cold, bringing
sleet and snow. It was at half-past ten that the
albino, having warmed his small, limp frame
with a pint of beer, turned out hie gas and
went to bed. He had scarcely got to sleep when
a loud banging at his street-door woke him with
a start.
As the banging continued he gob out of bed,
grumbling, and partially opened the door, enquir-
ing, “ ’Oos there ?’’
“ Are you the barber?”
“ ’Oo else d’y’ spose ?”
“ Then you’re to come with me sharp, and
bring along the best case o’ razors you’ve gob.”
“ ’Oos wantin’ me?”
“ Oli, shut up, an’ look alive. D’ye think I’m
goin’ to stand ’ere all night answerin’ questions?”
snarled the man, shivering.
“you’re none too bloomin’ perlite yerself,”
snapped the albino, slamming the door in the face
of the man, who retreated to the waiting buggy,
cursing the weather.
Presently the albino emerged, well wrapped up.
“ Ready ?” asked the man.
“ Ready,”
“ Not forgettin’ the razors?”
“ Not fergettin’ th’ razors.” And neither spoke
again until, after a long drive into the pitch-black,
sodden country, they drew up at a cottage.
The door was opened by a tall man.
“ Come in, my man,” he said, and the albino
entered, blinking at the light.
It was a small room without a fireplace. Two
silent, serious-faced men sab watching him.
“ Remove your web things,” said the tall man,
and when the albino had complied, he continued,
“Now, barber, are your razors sharp?”
“Yes’ir, sharp as razors,” said the albino, his
teeth chattering with cold.
“This is no time for jests,” reproved the tall
man ; “I want you to shave a patient as soon as
you are warm enough to keep a steady hand—a very
steady hand, mind.”
The albino with a low, whistling sigh, drew
forth his ease and examined its contents.
“ Whenever you are ready,” hinted the tall man,
and the three preceded the albino into a larger room
adjoining. The lamp was shaded, bub a bright fire
shed a flickering glow over a bed upon which, moan*
ing at intervals, bub tossing, tossing ever, with
incessant rolling of her pain-racked fevered head,
lay the girl who had come to him in the summer,
the possessor of—his hair.
“This is the patient. You can begin at once,”
said the tall man, as the albino made no sign.
“ I couldn’t do it, sir ! Wot a sacrifice! ” And
all the blood in the albino’s luke-warm body flew
to his face and set his stiff limbs tingling.
“ lb must be done,” said the tall man, sternly.
The albino lifted a wisp of her hair, no longer
glossy and soft; tangled, tarnished, harsh to the
touch of his slow-moving fingers.
They attempted to hold her still, bub no efforts
could quiet her. Anguished at the sight of that
black, dishevelled mass the albino said ;
“ If I’d a brush I think I’d calm ’er down.”
They handed him one, which he drew slowly
and regularly from her forehead to the furthest
point of hair he could reach. At the end of an
hour she lay still.
He clipped every lock, laying each to each as he
relinquished them, until you could have supposed
them severed at one cub.
The shaving was more difficult: the light was
poor.
Bub after two hours there remained a bald head
with a little fringe of black round the face, where
a narrow line of hair still grew.
The albino gathered his tools whispering, “ I
’sposo I’d better take this ’ere ’’-indioatim,
hair-“ an’ make it up : ’er mother mighUik
m^ YeB ’ yes ’ j,,sb as you Piease,” said the til
. “ Pore young thing,” went on the albino wind
ing the hair into a neat coil ’ u '
“It’s very sad,” replied the tall man; “nunil
teacher, teaching all day, studying all night to„
much for mortal woman-the result—Look
mg towards the bed, then, as if struck by some
thing he saw there, he stepped swiftly to the eirvl
side. R 18
“ Barber, you have left a fringe of hair !”
“ Yes’ir, I thought they’d like it, in—in case of
anythin’ ’appenin’—she’d not look so-so Wid
like.” u
“I understand.” And the tall man bowed hi«
head. 18
Two days later something did happen.
„
* # *
The albino wove the hair into a beautiful
plait, secured at each end by a buckle cleverly
made from its own strands. r
Rut her mother never got it.
When he came to the end at last, after six
weeks of loving toil, and was about to send it
away, something snapped at his heart,
He tried to weep ; not a tear. Then he rose and
? astl an enquiring eye upon the beams which
braced his roof.
*, l 'e middle one would do,
, He got his step-ladder and placed it beneath the
beam, then mounting, found the precious coil just
enough. As he finished his preparations
a verso he had once seen quoted in a weekly paper
caine into his head :
When I lie tangled in her hair,
_My *°'* s hut set me * ree >
wm^ed tribes who roam the air
T * u a inow no s ' lch liberty,
” ac * a PP ea led to him as a barber, and now he
understood it as a man. He repeated it softly as
. . • n ° such liberty, he concluded, smiling
to himself. 1 hen he kicked away the ladder,
f j very happy they said when they
tound him— for a hanged man.”

MABEL HOLMES.
A London jeweller has struck a new kind
of sl °w torture for the public. He places a gold
watch in his window ticketed <£ls. Every day
the price comes down £l, so that—if not pre-
viously sold—on the sixteenth day the watch will
h 0 given away gratis to the first applicant. The
horror of the thing is that a large number of
people have decided to buy the watch when it
comes down to a certain price, but each is eaten
U P with the fear that another man may have
resolved to buy it just one day before him. There-
f°re» the intending purchasers come along daily
and £ azo with staring eye-balls at the watch, and
tear their hair with suspense outside the window,
and the jeweller laughs a fiendish laugh inside. ’

“ The volume takes its name from one of the sketches, ‘ The Last of Six,’ though in point of merit they all stand pretty well on a ] ar. The
author, who is familiar with life in Northern Queensland, writes with vigour about the doings of the whites and the natives in these faraway
parts. A strong vein of mysticism runs through his narratives, and there are ghosts in almost every chapter, and for those who are fond of
realistic work the volume will prove attractive reading ” —S.M. Herald, July 8, 181)3.
“ No writer has given the world a more vivid description of Australia and its wilderness than Ernest Favenc, and the secret of this is that
he has, by many years’ experience of travel and bush life, acquired a knowledge of this continent which is possessed by scarcely any other writer.
He, too, possesses great descriptive powers. Whatever he puts pen to is certain to be good. In the stories under notice he has given us some of
his best work. That they will be widely read is certain.”— Sydney Mail, July 8, 1893.
“ They present with force and vividness, as well as ■with the accuracy arising from long contact and keen observation, striking pictures of
parts of Australia unfamiliar to most of its inhabitants ; they tell, sometimes with remarkable power, of incidents such as happen in wild places
when human hearts are stirred by strong passions, and of weird imaginings that move the minds of lonely men. ‘ The Last of Six ’is a terrible
tale of cannibalism, treachery, and revenge upon the dead, which in other hands might be gross and hideous, but which Mr. Favenc makes of
thrilling interest. ‘ The Haunt of the •) inkarras suggests Rider Haggard and his imitators to some extent, but is itself relieved from the
suspicion of imitation by faithful local colour and a grotesquerie of conception, in which Mr. Favenc here and there approaches Foe. This
characteristic is especia ly noticeable in ‘ Spirit Led, which the great American might have written. ‘A Cup of Cold Water is, perhaps, the
best tale in a collection that should be widely read, and which forms a worthy addition to purely Australian literature. ’’—Daily Telegraph
July 15, 1893.
“‘The Last of Six ;’and other stories. By Ernest Favenc. (Sydney: The Bulletin Newspaper Co) This is a collection of short bub
graphic sketches by Mr. Favenc, the well-known explorer, who has a rare collection of Australian legendary lore. All the stories here are good,
and we can heartily endorse the recommendatory notice by Rolf Boldrewood prefixed to this collection. The present issue forms the third of The:
Bulletin scries of Australian reminiscences.”— Australian Star, July 15, 1893.
