Anatole France
Though of the school of Voltaire, Anatole
France neither sneers nor does he grin ; he
takes life smiling by the hand, and gently
banters. His real name is Jean Anatole
Thibaut; his bodily father was a little book-
seller whose pen-name was “France,
libraire”; but the father of his mind was
Pyrrho, that amazing old Greek founder o'f»
agnosticism who first showed that man can
never really know anything; it was from him
that Anatole France derived his gay scepti-
cism, and he has been the principal exponent
of the Greek spirit of truth, moderation and
smiling irony in twentieth-century Europe.
It is said that lvipling re-writes every sen-
tence eight times before publication, and
that is why his writing seems so vivid and
spontaneous; and I should be quite prepared
to hear that with Anatole France the
figure is 80, for his remarkable style is the
best instance ever known of supreme art
concealed by apparent simplicity—so simple
and clear that it reminds one of a blue-eyed
child telling fairy tales; but the fairy tales
are honeyed gall. He achieves this by infinite
Selection, compression, balance of rhythms
and passionate—l had almost said agonised
—search for the exact word.
When we sound a note on the violin we
bear not only the actual note but others,
thirds, sixths, octaves, I suppose theoreti-
cally to infinity ; these we call overtones, and
it is on their number that the rich tone of
a violin depends. Similarly, in great prose
we get overtones, which we call irony, sug-
gestion, allusion, inference and the like
according to the receptiveness and wit of
our own minds; but in no prose do we get
more than in that of Anatole France, and
it is these overtones which give to so much
that he has written the impression of almost
fiendish cleverness. You may always be sure
that he means you to understand more, much
more, than he says. Largely owing to this
he has a power, unrivalled even by Kipling,
of calling up the past by one or two magic
touches.
He began with poetry, for he has a poeti-
cal mind, but soon turned to prose. He
earned a living by reviewing and other
branches of literary journalism and quarrelled
with Zola over a severe—but not too severe
—attack on Zola’s filth. There is a cult
which holds it broad-minded. to like Zola,
filth and all; Anato.le France is certainly
no Puritan, but his damning of “La Terre,”
not for dirt but for inartistic squalor which
leaves out half of human nature, is the most
scathing thing I ever read, not so much for
what is said as for what is inferred. When
the Dreyfus case arose the two men came
together again to secure a hearing for the
Jew, and it is doubtful whether the roar of
Zola or the mockery of Anatole France was
the more effective in bringing the French to
tbeir senses. When the storm subsided Ana-
tole France was the most famous writer in
the world. In 1914 this pacifist, 70 years
old, volunteered ; his pacifism could not bear
to see his country over-run. The Govern-
ment gently handed him back his pen to write
for the soldiers.
His greatest work is “The Life of Joan of
Arc.” Mr. W. L. George— Anatole France
(Nisbet) —finds this stupendous book, which
took 20 years to write, hard to read. In
all politeness one must say that this is not
the fault of Anatole France. With profound
learning arid consummate literary skill he
showed that the warrior-maid of conventional
history, who relieved Orleans when all the
men failed, never existed but as a religious
myth; that she was as much a “saint” as
St. Denys. St. Michael or St. George. In
place of the great General he leaves a sick
child. No serious reply to this has ever
been made, for reply is impossible: Andrew
Lang merely corrected a few references
which Anatole France smilingly accepted,
and last year St. Jeanne d’Arc was formally
created by the Church. It is characteristi-
cally English that the “New Age Encyclo-
paedia,” while solemnly repeating the old
rubbish as if it were all true, gives Anatole
France as her chief biographer! History
will record him'as the first man who con-
sidered Joan of Arc by the ordinary canons
of historical criticism. You should not read
“The Life of Joan of Arc” unless you. have the
historical sense; if you study for yourself
the incredibly tiny authorities upon which
the legend is based, you will probably agree
with me that Anatole France, out of his
great love and nity for the poor child, has,
if anything, rather understated his case.
I do not agree with those who would put
him, as a novelist, above Meredith and Hardy.
There is one dear old scholar who wanders
under different names through several of his
books, whom one recognises as the novelist
himself: otherwise I do not find the char-
acters alive: the longer novels I find ill-
constructed and —I- shudder to say it—dull.
“Thais” is a glowing desert drama after the
manner of Flaubert; “The Crime of Syl-
vestre Bonnard” is a tender study of an old
bookfellov. though I have not yet discovered
what his crime was: “The Red Lily” is a
grim study of the Dead Hand : “The Gods
are Athirst” is a brilliant essay on the
French Revolution, not flattering to the
revolutionaries. The four volumes of “Con-
temporary History,” cast into the form of
fiction, demand too intimate a knowledge of
French politics for an Australian to read
them with enjoyment.
But it is in the short stories that Anatole
France touches the highest level, even for a
Frenchman. “The Singer of Kume,” in the
volume “Clio.” is an extraordinarily vivid
story of Homer, unrivalled for its power of
calling up the past. He thinks he is a
socialist, but it is difficult to imaghie that
critical and independent mind submitting it-
self to the dull, bailing, lord-mayorish fellows
who can alone come to the front in the red
republic; his head would drop into the basket
before the red flag had been hoisted a week.
There is a good translation of most of his
works published bv John Lane, Tf T were
beginning T should read “Mother-Of-Pearl.”
which contains the famous ‘■‘Procurator of-
Judea” that some people find blasphemous
because they do not. boar the overtones. Then
T should rend “Crsinqiibbille.” a powerful
little study of an old costermonger doomed
to destruction by Society. Next “Penguin
Island,” a brilliantly ironical history of
France, dealing with the beginnings of dress,
modesty, law, property, kingship and other
human institutions; it contains much pro-
found philosophy, and is, I am afraid, hope-
lessly pessimistic, for it concludes that man’s
troubles are due to man’s incurable stupidity.
The best life of him is by an American, L. P.
Shanks (The Open Court Publishing Co.,
London and Chicago) ; this book traces his
development, and might well have been
called “The Odyssey of a Soul.”
C. McL.
The Official and the Empire
Professor 11. Duncan Hall's British Com-
monwealth of Nations (Methuen) is one of
the most erudite and stimulating books
ever written about a shadow. The author
begins his- study at the period when
the Cobden school was suggesting that
Britain should cut the colonies adrift. The
immediate reaction in the white British 5
States overseas was the disclosure of an
almost pathetic determination on their part ?
to hang on to the British connection whether
they were wanted or not. The despatch of
the N. S. Wales Soudan Contingent—which,
oddly enough, is not mentioned in this
volume —was a vehement expression of this
sentiment, the striking of a note which was
to be heard more than a quarter of a century
later in every part of the Empire that held
a Caucasian community. During all those
years the Dominions were not self-conscious
about their Imperial status. Jingo theorists
had begun talking Imperial Federation the
moment the other side began calling .for
disruption; but the vast majority in all the
populations concerned were satisfied that the
old casual tie which had been good enough
for their fathers was good enough |Eor them.
The position was hardly modified at all, and
so far as there was any modification it was
in the direction of closer Imperial unity, as
the various overseas States acquired a larger
and larger appearance of complete independ-
ence. It became evident that tlie age of
miracles was not past so long as autonomy
remained to be granted, a truly astounding
example of its healing properties being the
transformation of the Boers within a very
few years from sullen enemies into friends
who were prepared to give their lives for
the institution that had oppressed them.
The Empire was not organised for defence
when the war came as it would have been
had a German official had the handling of
it from a central bureau for, say, the pre-
vious ten years. Standardisation was lack-
ing everywhere, which meant immense
waste of life as well as of treasure. But
the British never have been prepared to the
last button for a land war; and it will pro-
bably be a bad day for human freedom when
they alter their habits in this respect. Be-
hind the protecting screen of the Royal
Navy the different overseas Expeditionary
Forces muddled heroically along the road to
efficiency, and emerged finally as no mean
additions to the British effort. In Flanders
and elsewhere Australian and Canadian Bri-
gades were presently to be seen “taking
over” from the English or the Scotch or
from one another. Co-operation for war-
purposes was complete and flawless. There
was never a serious rift in the harmony,
either in the field or in the home-lands of
the troops, except where British office-men
—always with the best of intentions—intru-
sively sought to put the visitors from over-
seas on the right path. There was never any
general body of ill-feeling againtt the
Dominions or their soldiers iff the United
Kingdom unless an overseas office-man —again
with the best of intentions—spoke out of
his turn and was unfortunate enough to be
reported in the English press. So that
several interesting Imperial truths had been
demonstrated before the war was half-way
through:—
(1) It was established that without any treaty or
promise, written or verbal, the overseas Dominions
Governments could be relied on to throw in their
lot with the Imperial executive where the cause
seemed good and the issue vital.
(2) It was established that standardisation, while
desirable in many ways, was not essential to efficiency
and might even be prejudicial to it. Thus, the fur-
ther the war went the more the Digger receded in
habits, manners and customs from the BritisluTommy
and the more valuable he became.
(3) It was established that the less the component
parts of the Empire interfered with one another the
better it was for everybody but the Germans. This
principle of non-intervention was carried to the
length of denying the Wellington of the moment the
right to inflict what punishment he thought fit on the
Australian troops under him. Those who rebuffed
him had an eye on the effect the promulgation of a
death-sentence by an English general on an Australian
would have in the Commonweatlh. '
. The school of which Professor Duncan Hall
is a leader considers that the old bonds have
grown slack and need to be tightened up,
albeit discreetly. The scheme, roughly, is
an even greater measure of domestic indepen-
dence (thus it is suggested that tfie Governor-
General should become a Viceroy “appointed
by and responsible to the Prime Minister’s
Office”), coupled with a much closer associ-
ation with Downing-street. For example :
The Plenary Conferences [to consider Empire
questions] attended by Prime Ministers should take
place if possible once a year, or at ' the very
least . every 18 months or two years. The
regular meetings between the plenary sessions should
take place once every two or three weeks. They
would be attended by the British Prime Minister and
such other of his colleagues as might be required to
deal with the particular question under consideration.
On the side of the Dominions they would be attended
bv resident and visiting Ministers from the Dominion
Cabinets.
The author assumes a number of changes.
Fdr example, some system of devolution
within the United Kingdom which will give
the ImperL U a chance to be Imperial
instead of, 5 ”Bv municipal.

“A practical feeding experiment says that cows fed the properly balanced ration give 47 per
cent, more milk and more butterfat than those fed with the same quantity of unbalanced ration.”
Even when grass is plentiful, your stock must have concentrated food given to it, specially during winter months, to
produce satisfaction.
Do you know that Australia, in production of butter fat per cow, is the third lowest in the world?
Why not increase your milk and butter-fat yield and save money?
Hand-feeding with concentrate will increase the milk yield.
Help your stock to help you to bigger profit by giving them the food to produce milk.
Good, wholesome food fed to dry cows will insure healthy and well-nourished calves in the spring. The milk production
will be greater, and the period of lactation longer.
. Give them a ration that will warm them up to milk-giving pitch, maintaining animal heat and improving the milk-
producing functions.
They must have concentrates for capacity production.
If you only feed an unbalanced ration, such as grass, corn and bran (although fed in quantity) it is not sufficient for the
fullest possible milk flow. The feed must be of right quality, containing the concentrates necessary for maintenance and surplus
for production.
Feed for a purpose.
Secure a ton of Meggitt’s Cattle Food—exact for its purpose—and judge results with past
experiences.

The day of harsh purgatives, of
big cathartic pills is over—gone for
ever. No need ary longer to
swallow a nauseating dose to give
nature the gentle assistance re-
quired. Pinkettes, the new laxative,
are little pink, sugar-coated ovals,
easy to take and pleasant in their
action. They are not drastic,
although certain and thorough.
Pinkettes are designed to
arouse the sluggish bowels and tor-
pid liver, to correct bad breath,
clear the complexion, and banish
biliousness and headache.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Romance.
Sometimes it is a mulberry-tree
That brings her back to me—
A grey fence dropping dry, green moss.
Beads or a silver cross.
There is a balcony of rose
From which a woman throws
Warm kisses to a haunted star
In moony mists afar.
She does not see my pensive look,
Her finger in a book;
But by the br wn breeze of her hair
I feel romance is there.
And by a creaking stair I know
How in the court below
With flagged stones damp with lovers’ tears,
She guards her secret years.
In clover fields where lambkins bleat
Their grassy measures sweet,
She passes like a lullaby
Noon-cradled in the sky.
On many a pallid, ghastly plain
Red with the battle rain,
Amid the dead, about the strife,
She drinks her draught of life.
Hush! What a footfall, elfin-light.
Upon the floor of night!
I look and like a brooding dove
She leans above my love.

They brought me violets in the Spring,
And sweet primroses pale;
In ecstasy the thrushes called
From out the budding vale.
But other flowers of other lands,
Were in my eager outstretched hands,
And on the morning wind I heard
The Spring-song of a distant bird.
In lands of home, in Spring, in Spring,
The clematis hangs white;
The kowhai makes the dim, bush track
A way of gold delight;
High in the yellow, honeyed boughs
The blithe-heart tuis sing,
And through the sombre forest peals
Their paean to the Spring.
They gave me roses, Summer-born,
And lilies tall and white;
In rustling woods a nightingale
Extolled the fragrant night;
But I have seen the ratns stand
Like crimson towers about the land,
And on the windy mouhtain-side
The living flame of broom spread wide.
In homelands far, through Summer hours,
The foam-flecked Christmas-trees
Will cast their glowing petals down
On tranquil azure seas ;
And when the dawn is silver-clear,
And all the world a-hush,
The bellbirds rift with faery chime
The silence of the bush.
I gathered boughs all crimsoning,
And leaves of tawny gold;
Black-limbed the naked elms stood forth,
Stark in the moonlight cold.
But there are isles in southern seas
That know not Autumn’s wasting trees,
Nor Winter’s melancholy dearth
Upon a barren, ice-bound earth.
In dear, lost lands, though grey the days,
Beneath a drifting rain,
The wet leaves gleam on dripping trees,
Green-hedged each field and lane,
A warm sun in a dappled sky,
A keen wind from the sea—
O forests dark ! O hills of home !
How loved your memory !

AN INVITATION TO THE
MEN OF AUSTRALIA.
Write for Patterns
of Lowe’s Famous
£5 Suits to Order
Lately the press of the Commonwealth and even the Federal
Parliament have been moved to discuss the possibility of a £5 Suit
to Order being made in Australia! WELL:—
£5 Suits to Order are nothing new at Lowe’s, and to demonstrate
that the value and quality of them surpasses anything obtainable
anywhere, Lowe’s have made up (in the ordinary way, without any
extras whatsoever) a£s Suit, and Mr. Lowe is now wearing it. Lowe’s
£5 Suits to Order have been worn by hundreds of thousands of men
for many years, and the vast number of repeat orders received are a
proof of the satisfaction given by Lowe’s £5 Suits to Order.
And why this satisfaction? Let us examine! First of all they can
be had in a large variety of designs and colorings in pure-wool Tweeds.
VICAR’S CELEBRATED
“MARRICKVILLE” TWEEDS
The Tweeds that made N.S.W. Famous.
Lowe’s positively guarantee that these suits will please the most fastidi-
ous man, notwithstanding the moderate price. Hundreds of our smartest
dressed business men are wearing them.
Photo shows Mr. Wm. Lowe wearing one of these suits, and you

The tailoring of these £5 Suits to Order is something that Australia
should be proud of. Every stitch is done in Lowe’s own tailoring
workrooms. Their own expert cutters cut the garments in the latest
styles, and an experienced staff of 250 tailoring hands turn out the
suits in a style second to none at anything like the price; indeed, Lowe’s
state that £6/6/- and £6/15/- will not buy better quality of material
or workmanship anywhere.
Sydney men are invited to see Lowe’s windows for patterns of
these £5 Suitings. Those who cannot call to see should write for

THE CHOICE—KARL MARX OR
WHITE AUSTRALIA?
The All-Australian Trades Union Confer-
ence at Melbourne wound up with cheers
for the homeless Red Flag, cheers for solid-
arity (the thing which tore New Australia-
in-Paraguay asunder so that no two brothers
were speaking to each other), and an impas-
sioned address by Chairman Holloway,
who stated that “the industrial workers of
Australia were at last resolved to adopt
Karl Marx’s slogan: “Workers of the
World, unite! ” It is a familiar name and
a familiar cry. Yet perhaps it is possible
ro have a trifle too much of Karl Marx, or
to have Karl Marx in the wrong place, in
which case he may be no better than the
valuable and indispensable bull in the equ-
ally essential china shop, or fish in tbe after-
dinner coffee. Karl was a thinker, with
ideas which were the product of his time (it
began in 1818) and his place (which was
cold and old and feudal). He was born in
a district which bad just been stolen by Prus-
sia and submitted to the wooden tyranny of
spike-helmeted Prussianism. Among his
people it was natural to be in a condition
of revolt against foreign tyranny, because
foreign tyranny was the common lot. The
man who represented defence was an alien
drill sergeant with a rattan; and in place
of the patriotic defender of his country there
was the alien-driven conscript with a raw
back and a badly-famished interior. Marx’S
ideas about property were largely based on
his early experience that a landowner was
essentially a nobleman, and one of the Prus-
sian or Mecklenburg variety to boot. His view
about the downtroddenness of people was
probably tinged by the fact that was a
Jew (real name Mordecai) In a time when
Jews didn’t get the applause they deserved.
His knowledge of the workers was acquired
as a lawyer and the son of a lawyer, as a
journalist and as an intense student at the
British Museum Library in London. He
was a product of big cities and crowded
countries. He never carried his swag in
the Backblocks, or pioneered in a new land,
or lived among a really free people, or even
dwelt in a decently-warm climate. Most of
his life he had no vote. He viewed the wage-
earner as a being necessurily apart all his life
from the employer, and requiring wholly
separate treatment. This was because a
Rhenish or Belgian or English artisan of
his young days had about as little chance
of becoming a peer, and a Mecklenberg peasant
as much chance of becoming a landowner as a
horse had of growing into a horseowner or a
cow of blossoming into the proprietor of a
dairy farm. His views were more or less
apposite in his own surroundings. And his
servile followers and copyists here try to
invent or imagine a state of things such ns
Karl Marx saw, so that thev can treat it
on Karl Marx lines. They do this by pos-
ing petty landowners, whose estates are being
cut up under the Federal land-tax, as poten-
tates, like the men who owned provinces in
Germany; any factory owner or other wage-
payer as a ferocious baron who came in with
tlie Conqueror, or as a slimy baron who
climbed to affluence as a toady of kings; pay-
day as a day when the vassal grovels on his
face before his lord and offers tribute; a
mining stoppage because some intoxicated
worker has been discharged' as a Jacquerie;
and the well-paid ex-parson Garden or Lam-
bert as another and greater Rienzi. It is
laborious make-believe this building of ima-
ginary walls between imaginary classes, and
then climbing over them in imagination. Still
some people live by it, just as knights once
made a good living by slaying dragons.
Karl Marx, who probably never saw a
kangaroo in his life, propounded his theory,
which his followers try to fit on Australia,
that all workers are brothers and capable of
uniting because he never realised (his very
limited wanderings forbade) that workers are
not all white, Christian and European. His
regular beat was bounded by Berlin on one
side and London on the other, with Paris and
Brussels as intermediate stopping places. For
65 years he stodged along in this narrow
orbit. He died without really knowing that
the great bulk of workers are black, brown
and yellow, and that they include Buddhist,
Hindu, Mohammedan, Shinto, animalistic,
cannibalistic, polytheistic, polygamous people
who worship ancestors, rags, ghosts, beasts,
images or devils and sundries that are very
sundry indeed. That some are nearly naked,
some nearly beastly and many incredibly
ignorant and unteachable and cheap and in-
competent were facts that didn’t come in his
way. So it wasn’t brought home to Kari.
Marx, otherwise Mordecai, that there might
be a question ranking above all other ques-
tions combined —that of preserving the white
race in its purity. In his sphei’e whiteness
was a matter of course. A man was born
white, lived white, married a white wife, had
white children, was oppressed by a white capi-
talist, died white, went to Heaven viiite or
was damned white, and that was the whole
story, Karl would probablv turn in his
tidy grave if he was informed that the white
man is rather an exception, and that there are
places where he can’t afford to be a brother —
where even the ijale-face garbage-man must
be a more exclusive aristocrat than a Prus-
sian baron, or perish along with the race.
* * * *
The one thing that the Australian can’t
afford to do —the thing that would be to
him poison, leprosy and suicide —is to start
uniting the Workers of the World according
to the rotten precepts of theorists who, being
muddlers themselves, only repeat things out
of books. North of us is a nation of
60,000,000 brown men, alien in race and
ideas, mostly workers, and only too willing
to unite. Not quite so far north are
320,000,000 yellow people, mostly workers,
largely small landowners, and guiltless of
the sin of hereditary aristocracy, who are
ready to unite. North-west are 315,000,000
blackish-brown people, almost wholly work-
ers, who are fellow T -subjects and so anxious
to unite that they are kept off with diffi-
culty. Africa to the west and Polynesia to
the east might fraternise when an invitation
reached them. There isn’t a spare white
man nearer than Europe to join up with,
for America has no surplus, but there are
colored folks close at hand in myriads. It
is impossible to unite with any or all of
these workers and yet keep them at a dis-
tance and exclude them. Union of even a
mild sort would mean that the White Aus-
tralian handful would be engulfed like a pin
in a maelstrom. And it is impossible to
talk unity to them without rousing a devil
who will be very hard to lay, and who is
willing enough to rise without provocation
or A united brother can’t
live in exile in Canton and yet be a welcome
and full-blown working member of a trades
union in Melbourne. What the united work-
ers, who, if really and truly united, will
be 99 per cent, colored, are to do is never
specified. But union is always mentioned
along with schemes for the complete over-
throw of the existing scheme of things here.
It is presumed, therefore, that the new horde
is to help in looting the Commonwealth
Bank, the joint-stock banks, the savings
banks, the coffers of the life-insurance
societies and things in general, a white roan
being visible here and there in the mglCe like
a cork tossed on an anery sea. To mention
to the great Unity of Workers, which must
be mostly Asiatic, that there is a civilisa-
tion here waiting to be looted and a country
waiting to be exploited looks like a treason
compared W’th which that of Judas
Iscariot ranked as virtue and deserving
of a No. 1 halo in Heaven. But the jdea
was alleged to savor of the Prussian Karl
Marx, and the All Australian Trades Union
Conference snatched at it with the aplomb
of an infant taking a hot stove to its bosom.
# * * *
There is a great truth which Aus-
tralia requires to learn afresh when it
gets over its passing craze that the
world revolves round Irish affairs, and
over its vision that it is a crushed
race because Karl Marx’s father was well
drilled in 1818., That great truth is that the
most precious possession a white nation
can have —its identity and its national soul
—is at stake. It is so much at stake that
the situation hangs by a hair. It will still
be precarious when Australia has 25,000,000
people instead of 5,000,000. The wholesale
mixing of the white blood is the one calamity
from which there is no recovery. Monarchs,
aristocrats, capitalists and assorted tyrants
are here to-day and gone before to-morrow ;
but the yellow streak, especially if it covers
nine-tenths of the carcase, remains for ever.
There are two policies for the white man
among colored races, and he has tried both.
Either he has classed the colored man as a
dog, and ranked miscegenation as a crime,
and preserved his race even if he lost, his
sense of humanity. Or he has mixed, in a
casual way, though never aiming at unity in
the mad, purposeful fashion of the All Aus-
tralian Trades Union Conference 'Dan.
Wherefore the proudest names in the civil-
isation of one-time white Portugal are now
quite legitimately vaunted by. men who can
hardly be separately identified among the
riff-raff of a hundred Asiatic ports and a
thousand Asiatic drinking-shops, while the
Portuguese as a pure white person is nearly
extinct. The White Australia doctrine is
attacked on two sides —by the opposition
to white immigration and the consequent
strengthening of the white garrison, and by
the theorv that the Workers of the World
should get together in unity, the nearest
seven hundred million workers being just
the kind that White Australia can’t frater-
nise with and live. A mongrel variety of
Labor ism, run mostly by imported adven-
turers and fed on imported Prussian phi-
losophy, is resnons’ble for both sins.
THE PROSTITUTION OF THE
AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT.
“The King, for the time being, with the advice of
his Council, or the more part of them, may set forth
proclamations under such penalties and pains as to
him and them shall seem necessary, which shall be
observed as though they were made by Act of Par-
liament ; and whosoever shall wittingly offend any
article contained in the said proclamations shall
pay such forfeitures or be so long imprisoned as
shall be expressed in the said proclamations ; ana if
any offending will depart the realm, to the intent
ho will not answer his said offence, he shall be
adjudged a traitor.”— Henry VUl’s Statute of Pro-
clamations.
“This enactment,” says Dicey, “marks the
highest point of legal authority ever reached
by the Crown, and, probably because of its
inconsistency with, the whole tenor of Eng-
lish law, was repealed in the reign of Edward
the Sixth.” That is a mild way of putting
it. The Kingdom was in an uproar. Ger-
man mercenaries had been introduced to
stamp out anarchy in the Midlands, and
the forces of the Crown had suffered defeat
at Norwich by an army of 20,090 revolut.on-
aries before Lord Hertford, as Regent, de-
cided to cut away the despotic law of the
boy-king’s father. Grotesque though it may
sound, Australia in the first half of the 20th
century is beginning to approximate with
remarkable fidelity to England in the first
half of the 16th century. The chief differ-
ence is that our autocrat, W. M. Hughes, is
achieving by a side-wind what his royal model
was abie to secure by more direct methods.
The latest proclamation under the Customs
Act in reference to books or other publica-
tions containing “violent attacks” on the Aus-
tralian or any other Government, “or favor-
ing any seditious enterprise or purpose what-
soever,'” is of a piece with the rest of the
Hughes campaign to abrogate the authority
of Parliament, and, little by little, to swindle
the people out of liberties which took the
English five centuries to establish. The im-
mediate aim allegedly is to prevent the entry
into the Commonwealth of publications which
will betray to the average Australian what
the Americans and the Liberals and Laborites
of Britain are saying about the Lloyd
George Government’s handling of the Irish
business, and what the Chauvinist press of
France is saying about the Empire’s attitude
in Germany and Palestine. (The phrase
“average Australian” is used advisedly be-
cause the privileged enthusiast is rarely if
ever touched by keep-it-dark measures. The
military order which barred the Loudon
Nation in France only affected the Tommies;
officers saw the great Liberal weekly with-
out difficulty.) Now it is either legal to
sell, possess and read publications which
violently attack Governments or it is not.
The Nation, the New Age, the New Wit-
ness and the Daily Herald (all of which,
according to Melbourne advices, are to be
excluded under the new order) do not vio-
late the Common Law of England, and any
Executive attempt to bludgeon them would
accordingly be rudely checked by the Court—
in Britain. And, what is more, no Govern-
ment proclamation can make them other than
agreeable to the Common Law anywhere in
the British Empire. That principle, which
was dimly understood evidently even by
Thomas Cromwell, became part of the
Statute law in George lll.’s reign.
* * * *
“It was under Constitutional forms,” re-
marks Green, “that freedom was gagged fby
Thomas Cromwell for Henry VIII.] with
new treasons and oaths and questionings”:
it is by constitutional means that W. M.
Hughes is playing the same risky game to-
day. The Commonwealth Government cannot
by proclamation interfere with free speech
or the freedom of the press in Australia.
But by inventing “new treasons and oaths
and questionings,” and by causing them to
be applied by its salaried servants to selected
individuals and publications at present out-
side the Commonwealth, it can within the
law make a considerable steo in the direc-
tion of the absolutist goal. This is a coun-
try which is poorly served with papers that
state the case for the underdog. There is
not a Manchester Guardian within the
length and breadth of it. The equivalent of
a bush-editor arrives from some Irish hamlet,
and his provocative outbursts are given
columns in the oldest daily in the Com-
monwealth ; a lady-tourist returns from
Rome and mentions that the Fascisti (who
are Italy’s “Black and Tans”) “drove the
armed peasants before them with sticks.”
The public knows that there are mysteries
here; that Australian-Italians, armed or
otherwise, are not people wno can be driven
about with sticks; that under equitable treat-
ment they would not require to be so dis-
ciplined ; that Irish-Australians are not the
bloodthirsty curs the Trimbi.es would make
their fellow-countrymen out to be. There
must be another side to such cases. Bur
there is no daily press to give it. And if
the British Opposition press-—which is, inci-
dentally, the only reliable guide to Continen-
tal affairs within reach of our poorer
students’ purses—is to be treated as the
enemy press was during the war, then a
total intellectual eclipse must set in, so far
as about 90 per cent, of the inhabitants of
this island-continent are concerned. Some
people will argue quite sincerely that this
would be a very good thing. Their idea is
that the people generally do not know what
is good for them half so well as their rulers;
that they are liable to be carried away by
appeals to their sense of justice or pity —
issues which are dangerous when allowed
to intrude into statecraft. The value of pro-
paganda as a means of keeping Governments
in power was proved during the war. .lust
as a private soldier was not allowed to level
destructive criticism at his officer, so the
citizen should be debarred from doing any-
thing of the sort to his Executive. Everyth'ng
had rightly to be subordinated to the neces-
sity of winning the world-war. Now that the
world-war is won. everything, this section
holds, should be subordinated to the winning
of the Party-war. The way to dish pro-
gress in the Commonwealth is to begin by
shutting out from the view of the mass of
the people what Progressives are doing and
saying elsewhere. Anyone who with, his voice
or pen assails a foreign Government must
be silenced ns regards Australia, if only be-
cause what is is necessarily best. And when
by such means a gracious spell has been
laid on the electors, so that they no longer
question the action of any overseas Execu-
tive, the time may perhaps be ripe for further
measures—Parliamentary measures —making
it treasonous for a local writer or speaker
to criticise the actions of a local Executive.
Another school contends, however, that poli-
tical obscurantism of the sort never works
in the long runthat, though it may serve
the interests of a particular political leader
or Government for a time, it produces a
growing sense of suspicious resentment, and
loads in the end, where British communities
are concerned, to bloody upheavals. Free
sne«ch and a free press within the clearly-
defined limits of the Common Eaw, and
administration, not by the arbitrary ordi-
nances of some M inister posing for the moment
as “the Crown,” but under laws which have
been passed by the people’s representatives
in Parliament —such, according to. the anti-
despots, or, as they say in the United King-
dom, the Constitutionalists, is the only safe
method of government for a free and en-
lightened people.
* * * *
The second of these views is the one which
has been taken by most British Parliaments,
and by every Australian Parliament up to
the present. When Parliament has behaved
in dereliction of its duty to the nation, either
it has been packed or it has been actuated
by self-interest. Henry VIII.’s Parliaments
were packed, and the legislators who passed
the Septennial Act feared for their skins if
they went to the country. The Australian
Parliament is packed (the fact that a
machine instead of a Court did it makes no
difference in fact or in principle), and mem-
bers cannot afford to risk facing the coun-
try. Mr. Hughes, as he put it himself, has
“given them £lOOO a year each” in the same
way as he was given £25,000 by certain cap-
tains of commerce. The trusts whom he once
assailed own him (to the extent represented
by gratitude for £25,000 received and the
possible expectation of more to come), and
he owns Parliament on a similar basis and
to the same extent. Why, then, it may be
asked, can he not rely on his followers to
go the full distance and give him in law
the supreme authority which ho so obviously
desires? The answer is that this would be
asking too much altogether of human nature.
A Parliament may be weak, even corrupt; but
it is never all bad. It will not get right
down into the mud even at the behest of a
Tudor monarch, much less a Hughes. If the
existing Australian Parliament were asked
straight out to defy public opinion to the
extent of (say) making it an act of treason
to sell or own certain London newspapers,
circulated freely by the million at the centre
of Empire, it would refuse. If it were asked
to pass another Test Act it would refuse.
But it is debased enough to sit back in
silence while its master does just those things
through the agency of officials who clearly
understand that thev hold then- jobs only
so long as they are pliant. Parliament has
the power, if it wants to exercise it, to wipe
out immediately the War Precautions Act
Repeal Act. for whose continued existence
there is neither reason nor excuse. It can
over-ride and declare null and void every
regulation, order-in-Council, proclamation or
other ukase issued under that Act. the Cus-
toms Act or any other —if it wants to. It
can give the Commonwealth back the Par-
liamentary Government it enjoved before
the war—if it wants to. But it does not
want to. Its notion is to amble along in the
enjovment of its increased emoluments; and
while it does not dare to openly flout the
known sentiments of the electors on the
question of their freedom as it did in the
mnH-er of the salary grab, it is perfectly
willing to be a sort of sleemne mriirpps
crxminh in arv hostile move the Pr'me.Min-
ister thinks fit to make aeainst the liberty
of the gnMopt. In the circumstances. the
oninion of Hale, as quoted in Blackstoxe s
“Commentaries,” is unpleasantly to the
point:— .... , , .
This Parliament being the highest and greatesi.
court over which none other can have jurisdiction
in the kingdom, if bv any means a misgovernment
should fall upon it. the subjects of this kingdom
are left without all manner of remedy. To the same
purnose the president Montesquieu, though we
trust too hastily, presages that, as Rome, Snaita and
Carthage have lost their liberty and perished, so
the Constitution of England will in time lose its
libertv, will perish: it will perish whenever the
legislative power shall become more corrupt than
the executive.
The legislative power in Australia may not
vet be more corrupt than the executive; but
bv everv rule of law and ethics it is already
every hit as corrupt.


IN A RUSSIAN TRAIN.
“Forma Yakovich, European military in-
tervention will never, never overthrow Com-
munism in Russia; to attempt it would be
a grave mistake, and would magnify rather
than clarify the problem.”
The .speaker was Vassilly Teodorovich,
•son of my Petrograd host, responsible officer
in the Red Army, and loyal, lovable friend
who had acted as my chief guide in Petro-
grad, and was now conducting me to Mos-
cow, the soul of Sovietism, lie had secured
the tickets, and had arranged with relations
to meet and shelter us. His statement re-
called similar statements I had heard from
the lips of the Prime Ministers of Latvia
and Esthonia, from a high officer on the
Polish General Staff, and from several
well-informed Russians. Although, ever
*ince the Red ooiip d'etat in November,
1917, I had believed that the responsible
Governments of Europe could and should
organise a White army, hurl it across the
Russian frontier, and either establish a mili-
tary dictatorship until the Slavs were cap-
able of governing themselves or else stand
behind an all-Russian Government until
that Government was able to restore order
and reconstruct Russia’s national life on a
democratic basis, I would nevertheless have
been insulting my own intelligence and that
of my advisers bad I not listened to and been
impressed by their statements ; and when Vas-
silly, in whose judgment and veracity I
had complete confidence —he was a gradu-
ate of the University of Petrograd, a travel-
ler who knew Europe and America well, and
a distinguished officer on the staff of a Red
Army corps—also pronounced himself em-
phatically against military intervention, I
there and then determined to orient myself,
and try to understand why these men, who
were all more or less opposed to Commu-
nism were unanimously against the Powers
invading Russia with a great army. With
this in mind, I devoted almost the entire
time we took going to Moscow questioning
and cross-questioning Vassilly and those
of his soldier-friends who visited our coupct
from time to time.
“Why are you all opposed to military in-
tervention?” was my opening question.
“Because it would fail,” was Vassilly’s
laconic reply.
"But why would it fail?”
“Because Russia has the biggest and best
army in the world at present. We have
over five million men under arms, with
almost unlimited reserves, and at least suf-
ficient munitions.”
“But you forget that it would not take
the rest of Europe long to organise and
equip an even greater army.”
“Impossible, absolutely impossible, Forma
Yakovich. America would not send a single
doughboy; British Labor would not allow
Li o yd George to organise a White army;
Germany is incapable of offering a single
division; and the Red elements in several
of the neutral Governments are strong. True,
France could send a large army, but not so
large ns you would think. Poland, too,
could be of great assistance; and indubitably
a few of the neutral countries could help.
But among them they could not hope to
organise an army half as big as ours. And
even if they could we could nearly double
our strength, as well as retreat immense
distances, so that their attacks would spend
themselves.”
“But these things will not avail you unless
the morale of the troops is commensurate.”
“It is,” he answered quickly. “It is,”
repeated the others.
“But,” I said, “you, for instance, are not
Communists; and the same thing applies to
probably 90 per cent, of Trotsky’s army.”'
“That is true in part, but not in en-
tirety, nor even in the main. You are cor-
rect when you say that we are not Com-
munists; but this does not imply that we are
irrevocably opposed to all that Lenin and
Trotsky advocate. By no means. We
are, of course, against their domestic policies,
such as abolition of capital, nationalisation
of labor, dictatorship of the proletariat, and
so on; but when they say that reactionary
generals and ndventurers like Yudenitch,
Kolchak and Denikin must not be per-
mitted to restore the monarchy and so
squander the fruits of the Revolution, and
that different European and Asiatic Gov-
ernments must be prevented from dividing
Russia up piecemeal, we (and I think
we” —here he indicated all the officers in the
cm pet —“represent the intelligent progres-
sives in Russia) are unanimously behind
them. We have had enough of the old Czaristic
system of absolutism, with its autocracy
and bureaucracy, supported by the knout;
and we are determined to oppose all who
dare attempt to resurrect it. So we have
beaten Kolchak, Denikin, Wrangel and
Yudenitch, even as we will beat any other
who walks in their path. We also have
enough patriotism left to inspire us to resist
the breaking up of Holy Russia. We have
seen Finland, Esthonia, Latvia and Lithu-
ania break away and close the Baltic to us;
we have seen Poland revolt, and, not con-
tent with that, attempt to coerce the»Ukraine
into doing the same; we hare seen with
ever-increasing anxiety Japan’s persistent
encroachment in the east; and we are deter-
mined it shall not continue. We Russians
love our country in spite of all her past sins,
and so we fight with a good heart.”
“Da. da [Yes, yes],” answered the others
in chorus.
“Fine, fine. Vassilly Teodorovich, but
what about the ignorant or lethargic mass,
the peasants? They make up the greater part
of the army. Do they too see things in this
light?” I asked.
“Met! But, then, there are other'ways of
making them fight. The Communists are
clever propagandists and they tell the moujik
that Kolchak and Denikin. Wrangel and
the Poles all intend to give back the land
to the old owners, if they conquer Russia;
so the peasant, fearful of losing his land,
fights like fury. And there is more. If
these things fail, then Trotsky employs
other weapons. He goes to the reluctant
ones and says: ‘You have to fight, and if
you fight well you will be properly clothed
and fed, and yoitr parents and relations
will be put in the first food category; but if
yoh refuse to fight, or if you show cowardice
under fire, you will be summarily dealt with,
and your parents and relations will be
punished.’ And so they fight, realising that
there are hostages for their conduct.”
At this stage of our illuminating conver-
sation a yotyig Russian of high rank in
the Red army gave us an interesting side-
light on their system of holding hostages.
Before the Revolution he was an officer in
a crack regiment. He threw in his lot with
the people during the epoch-making struggle
in February and March, 1917, for he hated
the old system. He kept his command
more or less under Kerensky, but when
Benin seized the reins of government he
was arrested as a suspect and thrown into
Peter and Paul fortress. Here he re-
mained until the Polish raid on Kiev, when,
with several other officers, some of them very
high in rank, he was taken to Moscow, where
the whole party was instructed by Lenin and
Trotsky to draw up plans for a campaign
against the Poles. They did so, and after
they had completed them and handed them
in, they asked Lenin not to send them back
to the fortress. “Oh, no,” said Lenin ; “we
will wait and see how your plan of campaign
matures. If it is successful, then we
will see what can be done; but if it is
not” —he did not finish the sentence, but
they knew what he meant.
“There is one other point,” I said. “Now
that Trotsky has defeated Kolchak,
Wrancel and Denikin, and has bluffed the
Poles into signing peace, will lie demobilise
the Red army, or does he still hope to over-
run Europe?”
“He is demobilising the army now; at
least half the fighting men have been re-
leased, and others will follow as the political
situation warrants. We are all tired of.
war; we have been fighting for over six
years. Trotsky and Brussiloff are now
working out a plan of citizen militia, de-
mobilising the regular army as fast as the
militia is developed.”
“Then you believe, and you believe that
thinking Russia also believes, that the Red
army does not want to over-run Europe?”
“Da! Dal Da!"
“And that the thinking people would re-
gard intervention as an attempt to restore
the old system, or else as an attempt to
divide Russia up piecemeal, and that the
peasants would look upon it as an effort to
steal their land, and, thinking this way.
Russ ; a would solidify and fight and win?”
“Da” they answered again; and Vas-
silly added: “We Russians understand our
own affairs, and we want to settle them as
we think best; and so we want to be left
alone —that is all.”
TOM SKEYHILL.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Party That Has Lost Its Ideals.
Mazzini, writing 09 years ago about the
condition of Europe, deplored what he called
the anarchical disorder of French socialism:
The worship of material interests is now' its
watchword. Industrial organisation, which ought
only to be the means, has become the final aim. By
fixing the attention of the masses upon their
material interests the French socialists have assisted
in corrupting them. Man is not changed by white-
washing or gilding his habitation; a people cannot
be regenerated by teaching them the worship of
enjoyment; they cannot be taught a spirit of sacri-
fice by speaking to them of an increase of wealth.
Every word is applicable to the Australian
Labor party of 1921, That party, domi-
nated as it is by men who are themselves
dominated by phrases, has swung back to the
European socialism of last century; it is
a party that has lost all its old ideals!
Whether it talks, as in Melbourne the other
day, of socialising industry, production, dis-
tribution and exchange, or, as in Queensland,
of running bigger and more frequent sweeps,
or, as in N. S. Wales, of starting a Govern-
ment lottery that will cut the Queensland
‘Golden Casket” out, or, as in Sydney, of
making Hyde Park a permanent habitation
of “chocolate wheels” and other abominations
designed to raise funds for the A.L.P., Labor
exhibits the mark of a deadly materialism.
By gambling the “worker” is to be made
wealthy without toil—at least, the winners
of Government sweeps are. By “socialisa-
tion” he is to gain the whole co-operative
commonwealth and lose his own soul. It
is a programme as morally bankrupt as it
is devoid of brains. Not by sordid appeals
to cupidity and class-hatred did the old
Labor party win to power. The old Labor
party had an Australian policy for the Aus-
tralian people; in the new Labor party the
“inherent tendencies and special faculties” of
the Australians, the facts of race, character,
tradition and geography, are ignored. The
typical Australian is essentially individualist,
but the new Labor party proposes to make
him a socialist in spite of himself. Strongly
nationalist, he is offered a w r atery-eyed inter-
nationalism instead. . Proud of his race and
his institutions, he is told that race doesn’t
matter, all men being equal in the sight of
Bolsh, and that his institutions are vastly
inferior to those enjoyed by the moujiks of
liussia. A proved fighting man, he is to
be committed, in foreign relations, to the
lowly pacifism qf a Buddhist monk. Such
is the policy that has been framed for the
breed of Ari Burnu, of Pozieres, Polygon
Wood, Hamel, Villers-Bretonneux, Mont St.
Quentin and the Hindenburg line! The force
of folly could no farther go.
The Big Cities Grow.
Victoria held a count of its Federal electors
at the end of May and found out things
which are calculated to make it wonder
exactly w’hat sort of a horrid joke all the
talk of “decentralisation" amounts to. The
census figures, when they are fully developed,
will show the changes between 1911 and
1921. But the enrolment statistics do more.
They show how fast the country has been
emptying into the city even between the
date of the election of 1914 and this year.
Victoria consists of 21 Federal electorates,
which will be only 20 when presently an-
other member is lost —10 metropolitan and
11 in the country and the country towns.
The districts w T ere laid out very recently with
a view to the nearest possible equalitv, but
affairs have gone askew in a mere seven
years after this fashion:—

Owing to the war the increase for the whole
State was small, but even if there had been
no war and the expansion had been normal
there is no reason to suppose the relative
position of city and country would have
been any better. In fact, it is possible that
it would have been a great deal worse, for
the war supplied an excuse for tremendous
loan expenditure in the way of putting
people “on the land.” When the necessary
electoral re-arrangements are made the situ-
ation is expected to be as follows: —-
(1) Victoria will lose one member to N. S. Wales,
reducing its membership iu the House of Repre-
sentatives to 20.
(2) The Vic. country districts will lose one
member to the Vic. One Big City, so that the Cab-
bage Garden will have nine country members and 11
metropolitan in the House of Reps, instead of 11
country and 10 metropolitan.
(3) The member which Victoria loses to N. S.
Wales will go to Sydney, the Ma State’s One Big
City, and not to the country.
(4) The country- districts of N. S. AVales, being
also on the down-grade, will lose one of their own
members to swell the representation of Sydney.
The Australian, already the most persistent
city-dweller among white peoples, is not
only losing the pioneering instinct and the
love of the open places and the open road and
the feelings of the Man from Snowy River;
he is in danger even of forgetting what the
country is like. And he is doing this not
for lack of space but by choice. When all
the railways lead to one city, and all trade
is directed to the port of that city, and the
Government, Parliament, finance, commerce,
trades-union bosses and the management of
everything are there, and the revenues, loan
moneys, doles and jobs are dispensed there,
strange things are bound to happen. Decen-
tralisation won’t be brought about by the
city politicians, who gather all the fleshpots
around them, urging other people to get away
from the fieslipots.

G. F. Pearce Finds the Garden of
Eden.
Senator-Minister Pearce lately returned
from a visit to the North, bringing back a
surprised expression. He found that up
there is a great country and that some of it
has a climate akin to that of Tasmania —
for the reason that high altitude makes up
for low latitude, which is why there may be
snow under the equator, just as it explains
how Quito comes to be the City of Perpetual
Spring. Yet with its climate, its rainfall,
its rivers and its fertility it is slipping away
from us, because it is governed per telegraph
by strange absentee people from afar off —so
far that Wyndliam is ruled at 2177 miles
range from Perth and Burketown at 1482
miles range from Brisbane, while Darwin
has its Government about 4000 miles away
by any practicable route. There is no other
such area on earth so wholly run on absentee
principles. There are now two separation
movements in N. S. Wales, one or two in
Pearce’s own State —the biggest place on
earth which purports to be managed by one
Government and that one down in a corner
—and two in Queensland. But a disastrous
clause was inserted in the Federal Constitu-
tion to the effect that separation can only
be legally attained by the consent of the
Legislature at the bloated metropolis, and it
has been the policy of the baser sort of
State Premiers to discourage and depopulate
the outlying regions which are likely to aim
at setting up house for themselves, so that
the reliable votes of the One Big City and
the districts naturally attached to it' shall
form a majority and make , secession impos-
sible. Even Senator-Minister Pearce,
though he says that the North is a great
and worthy land where there ought to be
people, says nothing about getting them
there. Apparently being of the old stereo-
typed sort his idea is to get population by
going on a little harder than ever in the
ancient fashion which has prevented popu-
lation. Brisbane started being an isolated
capital in 1859 with 7000 inhabitants. With
few advantages save that it was a capital it
grew to have a population of 189,000 in
1919. There is no visible reason why Towns-
ville or Rockhampton or Bowen or Gladstone
should not do the same in the same circum-
stances, and then the North would be popu-
lated and Mr. Pearce could cease from griev-
ing and making a noise like a muffled drum.
In theory there is nothing for a Federal
Government to do by way of promoting the
subdivision of Australia, but in practice it
might accomplish a great deal. If it merely
declared in season and out of season that
the making of new States, ports and cities
was part of its religion and that it would do
everything possible to that end, it would at
least be an'influence. Then it could announce
with emphasis that it would make no
more loans to the Big City Governments of
overgrown States for the alleged development
of the wilderness, the reason being that the
wilderness isn’t developed but only becomes
worse while the Big City bloats. At the
same time It could declare its willingness
to give financial aid to new States when
formed —new States on the spot, in a man-
ner of speaking, and not run by absentees.
It could test popular opinion by referendum
about giving the Commonwealth the power
of subdivision. And it could set to work in
dead earnest to make its own one-third or
more of tropical Australia accessible, even
if it dropped a few hundred other matters
for a time. The garden of Australia is just
as good now as it was when Captain Cook
came to these parts. It is no better for
Georoe Pearce’s finding of it. And it will
be no better unless people like Pearce do
a great deal more than be struck with admi-
ration at their find when they ought to be
overwhelmed with shame at their past igno-
rance and indolence.
The Morals of Vested Interests.
Reflections on pheasants and Fairfaxes :
F. W. Bamford put the acid on a quaint piece
of administrative hypocrisy in the House of Reps,
the other day. lie asked in effect why the Govern-
ment, m represented by the P.M.G.’s Department,
pretended to be doing all that was possible to wipe
out I'atterAall’s sweeps, while In its capacity as a
tax-collector it claimed its share of the illegal insti-
tution’s plunder. But he touched only the fringe
of the forest of humbug which sprawls virtuously
across the whole community. The theory of those
who specialise in righteousness, and who are audible
chiefly in Parliaments and daily-paper leading-articles.
Is that gambling is an unmitigated evil. “The child
of avarice, the brother of iniquity, and the father of
mischief—gambling is all that,” remarked the S. M.
Herald by way of opening a recent series of attacks
on what it called “the moral blight of starting-price
betting.” The Acting Prime Minister lias damned
starting-price betting as vigorously as the S. M.
Herald in his time. Yet the two institutions by
which the thing lives are the daily press and the
telephone; the “shops” pay out over the prices
given in the first and book 90 per cent, of their
bets by means of the second. The Herald knows
that it would deal a deadly blow at what It calls
vice If it stopped publishing betting news; but if
might lore subscribers. The Government knows it
would practically kill most of the “shops” if it cut
off their multiple telephone services; but it would
lose revenue.

man for keeping a betting-shop, remarked that the
betting laws were anomalous. “If,” he said, “a
man booked bets in a Irouse (lie law provided a £5O
penalty, whereas if he took the client out to the
races, and did the same tiling there, it was no
offence.” He might have gone further and men-
tioned that at the races the pair would be encouraged
by the spectacle of Governors, Judges, legislators and
the owners of the papers which denounce all gambling
as “an unrelieved menace to the welfare of the com-
munity.”
But, it is claimed, racing is necessary to maintain
a serviceable standard of horse-breeding, and without
betting racing must die —that, in fact, the end justi-
fies the means. This, though rotten morality, might
look like good business were it not that no Australian
Government, Federal or State, has ever done any-
thing of a constructive nature to assist horse-
breeding. It does not take a magistrate, of course,
to realise that the whole business is as blatant an
imposture as the Federal Government’s attitude
towards 'fatt.’s, and the S. M. Herald’s attitude to-
wards the N. S. Wales betting-shops.
The race runs true to type, in these matters, all
over the Empire, and an agitation which is raging
in London againet pigeon-shooting at Monte Carlo
illuminates the position here as vividly as anything
could. The ease set up against pigeon-shooting
on the Riviera is that it is brutally cruel. The
birds have practically no chance. To show how
many of them were killed at one match, a writer in
the London Times mentioned that near the traps
there was a tiiick, blood-stained carpet of white and
blue feathers that had been blown out of
the birds. This is as true as it is hid-
eous, as every patron of an Australian Gun
Club will recognise. But the real objection to
pigeon-shooting is not that It is cruel. Grouse-
shooting, wherein a large proportion of the birds
es'eape wounded, to die in agony, is far crueller;
and there is more execution done at a big pheasant-
battue (and more wounded birds, and hence more
cruelty) than at any pigeon-murdering competition.
The whole offence of p>geon-shooting is that is the
two-up of the branch of sport to which it belongs.
In Europe it is chiefly indulged in by French and
Italian gamekeepers, whose employers back them like
horses; and elsewhere, as here, it is the diversion of
social “undesirables.” In short, it is not a vested
interest. A highly moral posture is practicable in
respect of it, without risk of the luxury costing any-
one who matters a shilling.
Two-up Is not a vested interest in Australia.
Big clubs and hotels do not depend on it for part
of their dividends. And so two-up is anathema,
while poker and bridge are condoned. Betting-
shops are rarely big enough to be termed vested
interests; and so, wherever they are small, they
are as diligently raided by the police as Chines-;
fan-tan dens. But the publication of racecourse
starting-prices chiefly for the benefit of the shops
is very much a vested interest; and, therefore,
it must prevail. Gambling at Flemington, Rana-
wiek and elsewhere is as much a vested interest
as pheasant-slaughtering in Norfolk. So the idiotic
claim is made that to bet at such places is a moral
act, even as it is humane to kill in an English
wood though not on a Monaco cliff.
The danger of all this humbug Is that it no
longer deceives anybody. If gambling is the c-urse
that some of our most respected institutions say
it is, then they should not be allowed to go on
making money out of it. If it does no harm to
those who bet in thousands of pounds sterling,
it must be innocuous as regards bettors in pence
and shillings. Nothing is so exasperating to the
poor man as the knowledge that he is denied a
legal right which the rich man possesses—even
though it be no more than the right of financial
self-destruction. And these are not opportune times
for exasperating the poor.
Ruined Words.
It has been remarked that certain words
change their meaning unon being adopted
b.v the wrong people. Thus “Christianity”
produces in very many modern people a men-
tal picture of futile little men in black hats
quarrelling bitterly over inessentials; which
is a widely different vision from the one
that the world knew in the dawn of the
Faith. Toryism, in the course of its search
tor a convincing alias, has polluted a number
of inspiring words, notably Liberalism and,
more latterly. Nationalism. And there is a
phrase that has had worse luck than either
—the once-honorable title British. All sorts
of people are protesting the unimpeach-
able quality of their Britishism while be-
hawing in a manner characteristic neither of

the race nor of its culture. Members of the
present Federal Government are passion-
ately British in theory. But they all agree
that freedom of speech should be suppressed
where it offends their political views; and
one member recently announced bis inten-
tion of using violence to stop public demon-
strations of which he did not approve. These
same alleged exemplars of the British spirit
favor the deportation of some of their critics
and the shutting out of others. Yet the in-
stitutions of which Britons have always been
most proud are free speech, a free press, the
rule of law and the right of asylum. There
is a basic principle of British law which
distinguishes it from practically all the Con-
tinental codes. The British system assumes
every citizen to be innocent until proved
guilty before a properly-constituted court.
A couple of the noisiest claimants to the
British standard of thought and conduct in
the Commonwealth are T. Henley and It.
Weaver, both anti-Labor M’s.L.A. of N. S.
Wales. Henley recently announced that
certain (unnamed) women who had been
made J’s.P. were undesirables with police
records. He gave as his authority for an
assertion which cast an impartial slur on
the entire batch, “Dame Rumor!” Weaver
lost many men in the N. S. Wales tramway
service their jobs, and ruined at least one,
by conveying secret charges against them
to the Commissioner. He was not wholly
careless of his victims’ rights. Not at all!
“I did not do so I'i.c., act as informer] in
any one case,” he told Justice Edmunds
the other day, “until I got confirmatory evi-
dence from at least three persons. I thought
that was a fair thing to do.” Members of
the Camorra were tried and convicted by
their comrades on precisely similar lines in
tlie-old Kingdom of Naples; but it was never
claimed that the proceedings had a British
touch about them. Communism had a mean-
ing that was far from despicable a few years
ago. The advocates of the impracticable
old creed might have been fools, but they
were rarely knaves. They were generally
associated with long hair, pacifism, a dislike
of soap, gentle benevolence to those in dis-
tress and a fanatical belief in the cause, as
stated by its Early Fathers. Since that
period Communism has been collared by
Jews and handled as a business proposition.
Its symbol is a small, beady-eyed, bullet-
headed Hebrew, with a powerful army at his
back, and all the will in the world to use it
for the suppression of everything the original
Communists advocated, from (lie right to
loaf to free speech. And then there is the
unhappy word Labor. When the war began
if stood for nearly everything that was most
admirable in Australian public life. The
Federal Labor party was the only truly
Nationalist party in the country. Sectarian-
ism could not breathe the atmosphere it had
created for itself, and it was free from any
suspicion of corruption. To get a line as to
the changes of the past six years it is only
necessary to study the proceedings of the
late All-Union Congress in Melbourne.
“Labor” in Australia takes its place in the
ever-swelling dictionary of honest words that
have been ruined by scoundrels.

A Most Important Industry.
Speaking at the inauguration of a suburban
cinema-theatre, the beaming Dooley, Acting-
Premier of N. S. Wales, indulged in a pon-
derous eulogy of the moving-picture business,
and proudly declared that it was becoming-
one of the most important industries in Aus-
tralia. Whether the most important (or
mostly imported) industry deserves these
raptures is a question. Obviously the N. S.
Wales Labor delegation in the House of Re-
presentatives doesn’t think so. During the
Tariff debate on cinematographs and cine-
matograph-films some of the Labor members
from Dooley’s State expressed opinions very
different from the rhapsodies of Dooley.
Mahony, for instance, “objected to foreigners
in big combines coming here and taking a
considerable amount of money and paying
no taxation,” and proceeded: —
Thousands of pounds were made out of so-called
“star” films, and no revenue was received by the
country. When actors visited Australia they were
compelled to pay income-tax- on salary earned, bat
the great American movie “stars,” with their
immense salaries, contributed nothing.
Said Riley:—
The amount the cinema people pay in taxation is
ridiculous. They are building immense theatres and
compiling great fortunes. The Combine will not
supply pictures to those who use Australian films.
This is a monstrous thing.
The member for Dailey suggested that one
way of getting more revenue out of Dooley’s
most important industry would be to make
the film duties ad valorem instead of charg-
ing a flat rate of so much per foot. In reply
the Minister declared that the ad valorem
notion was impracticable, since imported
films were invoiced at the cost of produc-
tion, “exclusive of artists and so forth"
(meaning presumably their actual value as
photographic material), and there was no
way of getting at their real cost. The posi-
tion, he added, was complicated by the fact
that imported films are not purchased in
Australia but hired from the owners (they
are nearly all Americans) or tlieir agents.
In some instances the latter charge the snow-
man a royalty of 3d. or Id. a foot: in others
they exact a percentage of the gross takings,
and "in the case of companies whose parent
houses are in America, films are - forwarded
by and all profits remitted to the parent
house.” The House was edified by this in-
genuous explanation but not convinced.
Massy Greece proposed that the duties on
films (educational and home-cinematograph
subjects excepted ) should be Id. a foot on
the British and lid. on the foreign article.
At lUley’s instance the penny duty was
agreed to, but the impost on foreign goods
was raised to threepence. The amendment
was carried against the Government by a
combination of Laborites, Agrarians and
Nationalists, the Laborites predominating—
a very significant indication of the feeling
in the National Parliament about Mr.
Dooley’s most important industry. But
while the doubling of the duty on the cheap
and meretricious Yankee film is satisfactory
as far as it goes, something more is neces-
sary. It is evident from the remarks of
Riley, Mahony and the Minister that there
are aspects of this most important industry
with which the public is imperfectly
IN THE HOPE OF A GLORIOUS RESURRECTIOX.
“Labor must prepare for the impending 'crash.”— Melbourne Labor Congress item.

acquainted and which should he dragged into
prominence without delay. A Parliament
which has been lobbied and circularised by
film agents into a condition of mild ferocity
is in the mood for conducting a proper in-
vestigation. Before the mood passes it might
delegate the job to a select committee, with
instructions to collect evidence and advise
on these questions, among others: —
(1) Whether the Australian film-maker will he
.sufficiently protected even under the revised duty.
Australia should be encouraged by every reasonable
device to manufacture its own mioving-pictures,
instead of relying on blatant and pornographic
Yankee productions.
(2) Whether supplies of imported films are, or
have been, withheld from showmen exhibiting or
desiring to exhibit Australian pictures. And if so
whether the penalty should not be g.aol as well as
a fine.
(3) To what extent trust methods obtain in the
trade.
(4) Whether the admission of imported films
should not be conditional on the production of sworn
evidence as to the total cost of manufacture, and the
apportioning of duties accordingly.
(5) Whether the income-tax cannot be amended to
meet the cases of Chaplin, Fairbanks, Mary Pick-
ford and other foreigners who draw large incomes
from the country without contributing a penny to
its support.
(6) Whether there should not he increased Pro-
tection for the manufacturers of articles used in the
tliekerscope business. B'or example, there are three
Australian factories turning out carbons, but, owing
to the competition they have had to face since the
slump began in Europe and America, they are in
danger of being wiped out. And judging by the
loud yelps emitted by the film-importing interest
when higher duties were suggested, it would like
to see them wiped out.
Other points on which information might be
sought would develop when the committee
got into its stride. If the industry is as
important as Dooley alleges. Parliament has
a right to learn more about it. And it hard-
up Treasurer is entitled to get more out of it.

A Voice Out of the North.
From a surveyor in the Far North :
What Boyd Caulk wrote from London ( B.
2/6/’2l) is plain truth which should be printed in
large type and posted in every public building in
Australia. We Intre land in Australia suitable for
settlement, millions of acres of it, especially in the
North : and if we don’t attract sufficient population
of our own race to use it we will lose it a> surely
as the abos. lost it and for exactly the same reason.
1 have spent 20 years inspecting and designing
land for settlement, and have carefully watched
the progress of individual selectors in various parts
of Australia. On .average land, with access to
market, there are fewer failures than in any othei
calling. Men have amassed considerable wealth at
farming or stock-raising who would have been
failures at most other occupations. I have watched
large areas develop from virgin scrub or forest to
rich cane-fields, orange-groves, potato-lands and
apple-orchards, and have seen a man refuse a hun-
dred pounds an acre for laud which was offeied in
its virgin state for 10s. For every acre that has
been so improved 1 could point out a hundred cap-
able of similar improvement. I know dozens of
suitable tracts in various parts of Australia ; but I
will speak only of the one nearest to my hand at
the moment. Here in the Far North in the valleys
of the Murray and Tully Rivers (Q.) are 1500
square miles of the richest country in Australia,
watered by two rivers and innumerable permanent
streams, with a rainfall or about 100 inches per
year and a climate equal to any in Queensland.
The main North Coast railway will traverse it on
ihe eastern end, and within the year it will be
connected by rail with Cairns and Innisfail. 1 have
seen bananas, oranges, pineapples, mandarins, pota-
toes, pumpkins, maize and sugar-cane growing on
this land to greater perfection than on even the
Johnstone, 10 miles to the north, which carries
three sugar-mills (two of them the largest in Aus-
tralia) within a radius of six miles, and could
carry three more, and where a farmer recently
refused £20,000 for a farm of under 200 acres.
The valleys of these two rivers would support a
quarter ,of a million white settlers in comfort. Vet
I rode tS rough the area for two. days—
passed the time o’ day with four men, timber-
getters, in my ride. What a proposition for a
Government to put before intending emigrants m
the Cold Country! But, alas, wisdom has departed
from our Governments, and pony-racing bulks larger
than patriotism with our politicians. But —and
make no mistake about this—if the, richness of our
northern lands is not advertised in the homes of
cur race so as to induce settlers to come in by tens
of thousands there will be trouble. Perhaps the
Asiatics talk more freely up here than they do down
south : certainly they openly say things to us that
would make even a Labor Conference delegate think.

Kt'cruiting in the R.A.X.
A complaint which has become common
siince the war is that "Australians take little
interest in their Navy and do not regard a
naval career as a fitting object for the am-
bition of their sons.” Who is to blame V
Why, of course, the Naval Hoard. The Syd-
ney Tklegbapji the other day supplied that
easy answer, adding :
It makes no effort to show the youth of the coun-
try the advantages of a naval training, or the possi-
bilities of promotion now open to every recruit.
If the lack of a little elementary propa-
ganda work of tin' sort indicated were the
only trouble or the main trouble, even the
leisurely and conservative Board could lie .
relied on to correct the situation. But. pay
and promotion are not the sola considerations
with thi> youth of the country who look
towards the Navy, any more than they were
with the young men who went into the
A.I.F. The thing the average Digger dis-
liked most was to la* sent to a Base, and
after that to be attached to a Motor Trans-
port Section or other non-combatant unit.
The men who made this country’s name over-
seas—as distinct from the comparative hand-
ful who deliberately loafed on it in luxurious
security—hated the inaction and futility
of “dud shows” like (say) so many of the
Lark Hill Training Brigades. Now, the
R.A.N. has been allowed to degenerate into
just that sort of “show.” The Japanese
fleet has doubled in strength since 1914.
Most of the ships are new and are being
maintained in full commission. They, are
"shock” formations and their members are
proud of it. The L.S.A. will shortly possess
d.") capital ships, all of which —barring tin'
Michigan and South Carolina—will be up-to-
date lighting instruments. Most of them
feature 14in. if not lGin. batteries, and are,
b.v comparison with anything to be seen in
these waters, as a modern 18-pounder is to
one of the field-guns that were used in the
last Boer War. The British Navy by a pro-
cess of scrapping its inefficient weapons—
even the comparatively modern Itenowii
went as soon as she arrived back from Aus-
tralia —emerges as a thoroughly up-to-date
organisation, prepared to do the work for
which a navy exists at a moment’s notice.
The R.A.N. is not that kind of institution :
it is largely a make-believe. And that is
the real trouble. Its prestige, the asset
which is not permanent but is only main-
tained at the cost of vigilance, hard work
and expense, has been sacrificed in the first
place on the altar of Party politics. The
Hughes Government has had to spend s<>
much money for the purpose of securing or
retaining votes that it has had little or none
to spare for Defence; and it has conse-
quently allowed the Navy to stand practi-
cally where it was at the end of 1913. In
the second place, the local fleet is becoming
more and more the social institution which
our old subsidised Melbourne Cup fleets
were. While that state of affairs persists
it is no use' trying to got the youth of the
country to take the R.A.N. seriously ; and
unless"they can be made to take it seriously
they won’t join it.

About the long loaf at Broken Hill:
Since the N. S. Wales Government commenced
feeding most of Broken (lill just on £lOO,OOO lias
been disbursed. The Barrier is wondering how
much longer the State can afford to go on spending
£4OOO or £OOOO a week in this way. The industrial
position of the field is no better and no worse than
it was six months ago; and six months hence it
will very likely be about the same. The cos. declaie
that with metals at their present prices, coupled
with Judge E dm ujrjis’s award of 19s. 6d. per shift
and a working week of 35 hours, they cannot pro-
duce at a profit. Some outsiders question this ; and
there things stand. Instead of drifting on with the
insane policy of public charity, The Bulletin urges
the Government to get down to bedrock and employ
one or two capable mining-accountants to investi-
gate the affairs of the cos. and ascertain exactly
what is the truth about the industry. Meantime
the more Judge . Edmuxds’s award is analysed the
more hopeless it appears. For instance, • lead was
about £35 per ton when lie gave his decision, and’,
no doubt that figure was taken as a basis. If the :
case was being heard at the present time, with lead
at £22. any award would have to be on different
lines. The deplorable situation in regard to work-
ing hours is forced home each day when the 3
o’clock whistle blows and the men now employed—
there are about 2000 on the whole line of lode—
knock off for the day. What would happen to a •

POLITICAL
POINTS.
The New State movement now stretches
across the continent. Always resentful of
Fremantle, which has collared 93 per cent,
of Westralia’s import trade, Albany and
Geraldton have formed separatist Leagues,
and the threat from the North was sufficiently
formidable to set Premier Mitchell racing
beyond Capricorn in a Government car. It
was his first visit to the province that pro-
duces all the pearls and pearlshell and most
of the woo], hides, dead meat and base
metals on which he descants so ponderously
in his policy speeches, and yet Mitchell has
lived in Westralia all his life (he is 55)
and passes (in the South) for a man who
knows every inch of it. He returned with
the sapient announcement that the North
was a fine country and that what it needed
was—a Commissioner ! The Northerners are
going ahead with their New State League.
Another outbreak of dark muttering in
the Country corner is reminding Joe Cook
that the “immunity” granted to the Govern-
ment during Hughes’s absence in England
will have to be withdrawn at the end of the
approaching recess. Already there has been
a preliminary skirmish on the Supply Bill,
and the edict has gone forth that the Gov-
ernment will have to make a more convincing
show of economy, or the consequences will
be serious. The same old threat has been pub-
lished ever since the Cookies were elected, yet
the same old attention is paid to their clamor
and the same old Cabinet pretends to be
impressed. Despite Gregory’s talk of work-
ing for a dissolution —a strictly personal
ambition, by the way—the Federal Govern-
ment well knows that the worst it can suffer
under the present party arrangements will
be a partial reconstruction. General dissat-
isfaction w r ith the administration of two or
three departments should compel Hughes to
make some changes in his Cabinet before
long. The little man will not have any
trouble in securing fresh blood.
Australia may be said to have had a bon-
zer, possibly even a bosker, time during the
10 months (to April 30) for which trade
figures are available. So little work was
done, in the popular desire not to be mis-
taken for “wage-slaves,” that exports were
£14,000,000 less than in the same period of
the previous year. And imports were
£70,000,000 more, for the country, between
its desire not to look like a serf of the capi-
talist and its hurry to get to the pony race,
imported things that it used to make. So it
bought 50 or 60 millions’ worth more fluff
and frills and notions than it could pay for,
and one way or another it owes the amount
—or posterity does. It has been a wonder-
ful time, and every day The Bulletin gets
half-a-dozen letters full of curses because
it gives the facts publicity.
To divert attention from the breakdown
of the demented N. S. Wales soldier-settle-
ment scheme, under which thousands of
Diggers can’t get land and dozens of land-
owners whose estates have been resumed
can’t get their money, Lang, of the Ma State
Ministry, began a controversy with Joe
Cook. Always ready for an argument, Cook
met him half-way, and the actual facts have
been obscured in a raging whirlwind of
words. But it is a case for action and not
verbiage, and being satisfied, as he says, that
the situation is about as bad as it can be,
the Acting-Priminister should (a) take over
full control of soldier-settlement in N. S.
Wales or (b) cut off supplies from the
Dooley Government as far as future settle-
ment is concerned and provide for the land-
less Ma State W'arriors in Queensland and
Westralia.
The experience of the Stanmore Preserv-
ing Co. (N.S.W.) ought to be of some
value to McTiernan and the other young
gentlemen who have been dabbling in Fair
Profits legislation; and it may not be lost
either on Judge Beeby, who hasn’t much
more knowledge of commerce than they.
The trouble with all such people is that they
haven’t the smallest idea of business con-
tingencies—they think trade is simply a
matter of buying at threepence and selling at

fourpence. The Stanmore Co. fancied that
it was doing splendidly; but the people who
were running it didn’t know enough about
the risks even of their own business that
have to be provided for. So the other day
when they found that, owing to falling mar-
kets, they had lost £103,000 in seven months
—more than half of it through the collapse
of the tin-plate market —the holders of first
preference shares threw them on the market
at about half what they had cost, while as for
ordinary shares they can be bought by the
bucketful.
When the House of Reps was discussing
the timber duties, Prowse, of Swan (W.A.),
declared that there were more sawmills in his
electorate than in any other. He might have
added that, owing to the inrush of under-
tariffed timber from North America and the
Baltic, some of the mills and hundreds of
hands weren’t working; but he didn’t bother.
He didn’t even trouble to put the case of his
constituents for adequate Protection. That
was done by Foley, of Ivalgoorlie, who stated
that not only the cos. and the unions, but
the Conservator of Forests, the manager of the
State Sawmilling Department and the Minis-
ter of Works and Industries asked for higher
duties; and he brought evidence to show
that, owing to the market being flooded with
cheap Oregon, 25 p.c. of the WestraLan cut
had to be burnt. In the end higher duties
were granted, and Prowse’s unemployed con-
stituents will have a chance of earning a
living. But no thanks to Prowse. An
amazing representative of the “primary pro-
ducer'’ is Prow.se.
Victoria celebrated its 70th birthday on
Friday. It was the custom until about 25
years ago to observe July 1 (Separation
Bay) as a school holiday, to remind tne Kid-
dies that the yoke of the Ma State oppressor
had been then thrown off. The first House
of Parliament set up, a Legislative Council
of 20 elective and 10 nominee members, was
Tory enough, but it contained some stal-
warts who reached out for better things, and
responsible government followed in 1856.
In a depressed year for pastoralists and
metal-miners the Queensland Government
collected ±2,410,170 in income-tax —±bbt>,Bo4
more than in 1919-20. By contrast Victoria
had a very good year, and the income-tax
revenue went up to £1,541,198 —ail increase
of £675,647. But V ictoria contains 1,530,000
people; Queensland only 755,000. Victoria
believes in low taxation and limited borrow-
ing; Queensland in sky-high taxation and
borrowing up to the limit. When a Vic-
torian loan fell due recently the Government
paid off part of it and got the rest renewed
on unusually favorable terms, whereas the
Queensland Government’s simultaneous ap-
plication for nine millious was abruptly re-
fused. By blatant threats of exposure and
compulsion the Queensland Treasurer raised
a local loan of £2,000,000, and he now talks
of extorting another £3,000,000, although, as
he remarks with boyish scorn, many of the
paper plutocrats of Queensland can’t pay
their income-tax. Incidentally, lbs State li is
the highest percentage of unemployed in the
Commonwealth.
N. S. Wales Speaker Dan Levy ought to
disguise himself as a hardy busliman and
drift round picking up opinions of himself.
Many of the views would probably be calcu-
lated to set the synagogue ablaze and burn
the kosher meat to a cinder. Dan’s con-
tinued absence from the floor of the House
because he can’t tear himself away from the
Speaker’s job is the sole reason why the
present Ministry is in office and shoveling
money out of the window. Its scat-
terings have been so magnificent that
some people reckon Daniel has already cost
the State from three to five millions, and
they doubt whether he is worth it. If the
Labor Cabinet which has Dan for its sheet-
anchor manages to legalise the scheme for
joining Paddington to Sydney, whereby the
party expects to secure a long lease of
municipal power, then many of his country-
men will think harshly of him as ratepayers
in addition to doing so as taxpayers.
Hebrews are a ratepaying, taxpay'ng crowd,
so there will probably be few left to carry
flowers at his official funeral.
Australia was formerly the Dutch colony
or possession of New Holland, or, at least,
the part now called Westralia was definitely
so and the rest rather indefinitely. Then in
1529 Mynheer van Schnapps had his title
definitely taken from him by Britain, be-
cause Britain had the biggest fleet, the charge
being lack of efficient occupation. The occu-
pation of a great part of Australia in the
north, north-west and centre is not much
more efficient now, according to the greatly
advanced ideas of what constitutes efficiency.
Naturally, Hughes wants a treaty —any
treaty—that will induce sleeping dogs not
to wake up and notice these things. On
the other hand, Meighen, of Canada, is
frankly in favor of a treaty if it will please
the United States, but not otherwise. He
doesn’t want to irritate his sleeping dog—
the Uncle Sam dog. Hughes, who had Massey,
of Maoriland. and in a less aggressive way
Smuts, of Africa, with him at the London
conference, expressed his astonishment that
any British subject should put the U.S. be-
fore the Empire; but every man has to think
of his own dog. When Britain and the
United States had their last war his Excel-
lency Don Bullfight, the Spanish Governor
of Florida, leaned towards Britain, and,
though Spain still passed in those days for
a great empire, while the U.S. contained only
8,000,000 white people and had not long
finished chasing the bears out of Philadel-
phia, Florida was promptly “taken over.”
Carrying out the behest of the majority
of electors as expressed at the local option
poll on October 21, the Vic. Licenses Reduc-
tion Board has cancelled the permits of 42
pubs and one spirit-shop in districts where
reduction was ordered. In addition 10 pubs
were wiped out at Nunawading and Boroon-
dara, which went bone dry. Up to date the
Board has obliterated 1429 licensed places
of one kind and another; in fact, it has
done more solid temperance work in 14
years than the fanatics would accomplish in
a generation.
The late Vic. Chief Justice John Madden,
with his penchant for finding something to
wax eloquent about, once made a speech at
an Engine-drivers’ Association annual ban-
quet. “What power you hold in your honest
hands!” said Madden: and he went on to
picture how if they went on strike the
wheels of industry would stop, the country
would stand helpless and aghast, etc.
Within a few months the engine-drivers had
taken the tip that Madden had never meant
to give them; and one wonders whether
the newspaper habit of boosting the union
boss—who is usually a very vain person—
isn’t similarly responsible for a great deal
of modern industrial trouble, both here and
in Britain.
The decision of the Allies that the Un-
speakable Turk may recover and retain
Smyrna and its superb harbor is (provided
there is nothing worse to follow) the climax
of the greatest fiasco of the war. Smyrna
is the third city for size and the second for
wealth of Abdul Fez’s old empire. Greeks
built it so far back that Homer was born
there (among other places), and they always
owned it commercially. The Allies gave it
back to them with other Asiatic regions on
which they had a historical claim. But
they brought back the deposed Constantine
and his Hun wife, and the Allies cooled.
They didn’t want to see a new empire
straddling Europe and Asia with Mrs.
Sophia Hohenznllern at its head. So the
’Bus-misser of Europe finds his new empire
slipping away from him like a golden eel.
In the winter reduction of Vic. country
trains the Queenscliff service was so cut
down as to become useless to the local fisher-
men. Morley, the local member (he is an
Independent), remonstrated, but was told
orally and by letter that nothing would
induce the management to diverge from its
its policy. That same day, Thwaites, ex-
mayor of Queenscliff and chief organiser for
the National Federation, called at the
Department and put the very arguments
Morley had used. Followed an announce-
ment that the Commissioners had decided,
on further consideration of the matter, to
reinstate the summer service on a month’s
trial in the interests of the fishermen, and
Morley was wired to that effect so .that he
would get the news before he read it in his
evening paper. It shows the superiority of
abstract argument when it is supported by
a good concrete National Federation.
The latest name on the lengthening list of
British manufacturers who have changed
their fiscal opinions is that of Cooper and
Nephews, the sheep-dip people. lake Cad-
burys, they were enthusiastic Freetraders
until the Australian Parliament clapped a
duty on the imported product. Then they
came to Australia and started a factory,
on which they have already spent £75,000,
and when some of the foreign traders in the
House of Reps, talked about lowering the
duties, Coopers issued a circular appealing
for “a full measure of Protection against
unfair and unequal competition of imports.”
Incidentally, there are 12 firms manufactur-
ing dip in Australia, and the industry is
helping to keep at least one arsenic-mine
working. But that didn’t prevent some
alleged representatives of the primary pro-
ducers from decrying its value and doing
what they could in the fiscal way (ineffec-
tually, as it happened) to wipe it out.
WHITE CZAR AND RED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Gone is the rule of the White Czar,
Gone is the swing of the knout,
Gone are his guards and his Cossacks,
Dead are his sycophant rout;
Over his gates that were splendid
Darkness and silence are spread;
Go.ie is the rule of the White Czar—
This is the day of the Red 1
This is the day of the Red Czar.
See ye that stain on the street?
Mark how the people step by it,
Fearing to sully their feet.
Why is the Palace dismantled?
Why is there gloom in the shed ?
Gone is the night of the White Czar—
This is the day of the Red 1
This is tire day of the Red Czar.
Surely the land now is free!
Are not the rich in the gutter?
L~.j not the nobles the knee?
What if the perishing cities
Clamor in famine for bread?
Have they not slaughtered the White Czar?
Have they not honored the Red?
Madness has borrowed the sceptre,
Chaos sits high on a throne;
Murder and Rapine exalted
Shout that the land is their own.
Lo, the proud walls on the Neva
Gaze on the streets that are dead,
Dreaming a dream of the White Czar.
Dreaming a curse on the Red.
Lo, where cathedral and organ
Lifted a peal to the skies,
See ve the Ikon they’ve blinded,
Weeping with pitiful eyes?
Gone is that simple devotion,
Anthem and psalmody-sped—
Down with the Church of the White Czarl
Room for the heel of the Red!
Cities that weep by the wayside,
Where be your riches of old?
Where be the splendors ye boasted, -
Where be your trophies of gold?
Where is the wealth ye were prankt in?
Gone as a song that is sped....
Cease from these tales of the White Czar-
Room for the sword of the Red 1
QUEENSLAND.

Harper’s became a public co. eight years ago,
when £150,000 of 7 p.c. cmn. profs, were
offered and fully subscribed. The old in-
terests —the concern has been going 50 years
—retained all the ordinaries, 80,000 of their
shares being consideration, for goodwill. Be-
cause, of these goodwill shares —one-third of
the total of ordinaries —the recent 8 p.e. divs.
give them a handsome return. All except
£17,000 of the amount paid for goodwill is
now represented by visible reserves, which
means that the security for the money
put up by the public has been considerably
strengthened. That may to some extent com-
pensate for the comparative leanness of the
7 p.c. in these days of dear money* Harper’s
were fortunate in floating at a time when
7 p.c. money was obtainable with ease; diffi-
culty is experienced nowadays in securing
pref. capital at 8 p.c., and some cos. are
burdening themselves with 10 p.c. issues.
Judging by the magnitude of the liabilities at
the 1919 and 1920 balances, it looked as
though this co. might have'to resort to an
issue of new shares. No less than £233,108
and £210,857 respectively was owing on vari-
ous accounts at those dates. The latest
balance-sheet, hoyvever, shows that the posi-
tion has been comfortably adjusted, and the
£145,578 of liabilities is less than was shown
just prior to the war.

accounts were presented are shown in this

Stocks are included at “not exceeding cost,”
book debts are shown less a reserve of un-
specified dimensions for bad and doubtful
debts, and all other assets have been reduced
by depreciation allowances, amounts also not
stated. Present book values show that to
protect the £150,000 of prefs. there are net
assets of £411,142. The surplus of stocks,
book debts and cash assets over and above
all liabilities (including mortgages on
premises) alone assure a full 20s. in the.£
for the prefs. That and the fact that dis-
closed profits cover the amount required for
their divs. times over, makes their posi-
tion very snug.

The C.I.C. is one of three insurance cos.
which have been established in eastern States
within recent years to handle Cocky’s insur-
ances. The first was the Farmers and Set-
tlers’ Co-op., which was started by the
Federal Mutual people to induce primary
producers to take up shares in a co. which
would handle his risks at cost. Later, in
N. S. Wales, the Farmers and Graziers’ Co-
op. opened an insurance department, but how
jt lias developed is not known. The C.I.C.
was established on different lines. Towards
the end of 1918 two Vic. producers’ cos. —
the Gippsland and Northern Co-op. and the
Western District Co-op.—each put up £15,000
to start an insurance co. Later the Vic. But-
ter Factories’ Co-op. came in, and then the
co. crossed to S. Aus. and got the local
Farmers’ Co-op. Union interested. Last
year N. S. Wales was invaded, and the
Coastal Farmers’ and the Berrima cos. were
both brought in. In this way a paid capital
of £49,770 has been secured at small cost, a
performance which would not have been easy
had the promoters been obliged to canvass
individual farmers. The six big co-op. con-
cerns which, besides owning the C.1.C., will
represent it in the held, have a 00,000 fol-
lowing. It is an ambitious scheme, with
big possibilities; but there may prove to be
one weakness from a co-operative point of
view. The whole of the profits, after ade-
quate reserves have been made, are to go to
the proprietor cos. To begin with, these cos.
are to get divs. of not less than 7 p.c. on
their share capital. Then any surplus is to
be divided in this way: (1) the amount of
surplus profits estimated to have been de-
rived from the business of constituents in
shareholding cos. is to be divided among
the cos. in proportion to the amount of pre-
miums they handled; (2) any profit won
from handling outside business is to be shared
equally by the cos. Apparently there is to
be no limit to the dividend on capital put
up by these cos. For the 0.1. C. to lie
genuinely co-operative—that is, for insurers
to have their business taken at cost-price—
the producers’ cos. should in turn pass on to
their (’.1.0. constituents the whole of the
profits derived from the insurance concern
after retaining no more than a fair interest
on the capital actually invested. Should the
cos. hold on to more than a fair proportion
of tin l profits, then those of their constituents
who have not insured with the 0.1. C. will
benefit indirectly along with those who have.
The (VI.U. is so far only a small concern, and
has paid two divs. of 7 p.c. p.a.; so the com-
plications which may affect it as a true-blue
co-op. concern have not yet been experienced.
The management is proceeding cau-
tiously, and carefully selecting its risks.
For 1920 gross premiums amounted to
£21,251; last year £72,.‘>02. The under-
writing history to date has been as follows:
Net Pre- Ex- boss Expense
miums. Losses, penses. Patio. Ratio.
1920. . £14,285 £1689 C 0,477 11.9 p.c. 45.5 p.c.
1921.. 40,564 6903 23,924 14.9 „ 51.4 „
The past year’s underwriting surplus repre-
sented slightly more than one-third of net
premiums. The accumulation of reserves is
very properly receiving first consideration,
and after paying a 7 p.c. div. there remained
in hand £18,473. over and above the amount
swallowed by establishment costs. These
reserves represent almost the 40 p.c. of last
year’s net premiums which is usually re-
garded as adequate provision for unexpired
risks. Capital and reserves totalled £72,777.
Assets are a good lot; almost £09,000 was in
public securities, deposits and cash. One
item among the assets, “Agents’ balances,
£10,960,” calls for comment: apparently the
C. 1.0. like other cos. doing business with
producers had to wait for its money. Most
of these book debts have, however, been
liquidated since the balancing date. Ro far
everything has gone well with the C.1.C..
and its underwriting figures should expand
considerably with the assistance of new
policy-holders and the marine business which
it will probably get now that Government
produce pools have been abandoned.

In the published accounts the year’s profits
are given as £19,521, and that is after writ-
ing off £1316 legal exes, incurred in last
year’s re-shuffle. In the table above, how-
ever, profits are shown less £1992 of 1920
income-tax which the past year had to carry
and £2480 which has been set aside as “pro-
vision for taxation.” Even before making
these deductions profits were not so good as
those disclosed 12 months ago: still they
were ample to provide old interests with fat
dividends. Last year, when the ordinaries
got 20 p.c., altogether £15,430 was distrib-
uted ; this time the total distributions are
£14,727, though a little more cash-paid capital
now participates. Though nearly as much
was passed out as for the previous year the
div. rate does not now hit you in the eye.
The prefs. used to carry a fixed 6 p.c., but in
last year’s reconstruction they were lifted to
8 p.c., with rights of participation with the
ordinaries to 10 p.c. This concession to
the old prefs. was the result of the unusual
form the wash-up of the old concern took.
Y\ hen assets were revalued, the ordinary
interests got one fully-paid £1 pref. for every
10s. worth of net tangible assets of the old
co. in excess of the amount required to re-
present the old prefs. The ordinary capital
was still retained, set-oil on the other side
by goodwill. But in the reconstruction new
interests came in : Allan’s, of Melbourne, and
-Nicholson’s, Ltd., of Perth, the former appa-
rently putting £15,000 of cash into prefs
and getting 10,000 ordinaries as goodwill
consideration for making its inter-State
oigauisation available. The co.'s capital is
now £102,057—119,4-48 prefs. and 75,189
ordinaries, goodwill, patents and trade-marks
represent.ng £70,157 of the latter.
The old lleiron and Smith (’o. had a
somewhat remarkable record. It started in
1914, primarily to amalgamate two competing
billiard-table manufacturing firms—l leiron
and Smith and Alcock’s, In addition, a high-
class furnishing connection was hitched to
it. Later on it acquired the rights to an
Australian-invented music-machine, and the
manuiacture of Salonola.s has now become one
of the co.’s chief activities. During the war
other side-lines were taken up, mid as the
directors put it, the original business of
billiard-table making jjtas been extended so
that it now “embraces specifically everything
relating to recreations in the home.” Hence
the change of name when it was decided to
reconstruct. To represent the £119,448 of
pref. capital there was, at the balance, these
assets: —

About £2480 will apparently lit' required for
taxes, £5855 for the ordinaries' div„ while
the £1720 of depreciat ; on reserve should
probably also lie deducted. Book debts are
large, no doubt because much of the business
is done on a t.-p. plan. The co. has de-
veloped very well, and so long as the public
can afford music and billiards and such extras
it should continue to earn good profits under
a management as capable as that which it lias
so far had. Should conditions continue
favorable even better results may be looked
for as the inter-State connections are de-
veloped.

The value of estates administered increased
£71,000-odd during the six months, making
the total £1,078,547. But though that is
nearly £200,000 more than live -years ago,
profits have not improved. The past half’s
revenue was £4ll better than shown for the
same period in 1010; hut salaries alone now
take £385 more, and additional expenses
have outpaced new income. Nevertheless, it is
a comfortable little concern and over the
past live years hits managed to squeeze out
regular 15 p.c. divs. Reserves, however,
hoarded during the co.’s 34 years, exceed
paid capital, so on total shareholders’ funds
the div. actually gives only a 7 p.c. return.
Of total assets of £22,497 at March 31,
£10,596 was in Government stocks and cash,
£3785 was in mortgages, £3680 was advanced
to clients, and premises stood at £3OOO
(written down £2000) and book debts and
odds and ends made up the balance of
£1436. Besides those assets there is £40,000
callable to protect clients should the neces-
sity arise.

This is the first time net profits have ex-
ceeded the average which the old proprietary
business was declared to have earned over
the four years prior to the eo. taking over.
The co.’s average for its first five years was
only £3038, compared with £0741 for the old
concern. New capital has helped the im-
provement shown for the past 12 months. A
year ago paid capital was £47,150, but to
entice further funds practically all the visible
reserves were taken to provide one new £1
share paid to 4s. for every two fully-paids
previously held. Most of the balance of
10s. per share on this issue has been got
in, so cash-paid capital, apart from £735 put
in by employees, has increased by £10,390.
This, besides financing extensions and altera-
tions and modernising the frontispiece of
the building, enabled the directors to reduce
liabilities, which were heavy when the man-
agement became its own landlord. llow
the balance-sheet figures have behaved since
the co.’s first audit is shown next: —

The £34,fist! of liabilities are made up of
mortgage, £18,000; debentures, £11,790;
sundry creditors, £4890. But the eo. is
comfortable enough : its liouid assets amount
to £72,140, of which £7027 is (Government
securities. Gross profits have shown a
rapid improvement: 1017, £17.572; 1918,
£21,290; 1919, £20,215; 1920, £28,914; 1921,
£37,092. Expenses have meantime steadily
mounted, but an increasing margin has
become available for shareholders. The
latest profit was handsome, more so because
the directors report that it was arrived at
after protecting the hook value of stocks
against any possible slump. Book debts
are heavy: the eo. is doing a considerable
t.-p. business, which is usually very profit-
able.

On a banker whose account lias been
closed :
Although John Russell French was born in Bengal
and didn't sec Sydney Heads till be was 11,
Australia, he always said, was “the one land in
the world” to him. T 1 is father, a major in the
14th Bengal Infantry, emigrated in 1858, ami took
up land at Kameruka on the South Coast (N.S.W.),
where he died. The widow married Dean Cowpcr,
under whose influence, and that of the Rev. George
Macarthur, of the King's School, Jack French be-
came a devout and purposeful youngster with an
interest in church matters, and particularly in
church music, that Continued throughout his life. But
bis schooldays did not last long. At 10 he began
his 98 years’ association with the Bank of X. S.
Wales, becoming a junior clerk in the head office.
It was a period when things were booming, and
the banks and Governments fed the boom by wild
borrowing in London, the burst arriving when
French was an inquiring and observant youth of 19.
It wasn’t a very destructive burst, as such things
go, but it provided,, the youngster with a lesson
that he never forgot. From that period dated
a horror of useless extravagance and a preference
for safe and conservative banking that distinguished
his riper years. Years of hard work followed
as ledger-keeper, teller, country manager and inspec-
tor, in which last capacity lie spent several years
in ALL. Returning to the head office (he was 40
then) he came under the notice of Thomas Buck-
land, then the dominant figure on the Board, and
at Air. Buckland’s instance lie was appointed general
manager when George Afiller retired in 1894. The
appointment was justified by the fine work French
had done in 1893. For 27 years he occupied a unique
position in the world of finaq.ee and commerce. To
a sound knowledge of banking he united a keen
judgment of men and affairs, and under his adminis-
tration the. Bank of X. S. AVales became, as the
test of war proved, one of the financial buttresses of
the Empire. He was a shrewd counsellor of Treas-
urers who came to him for advice and a never-failing
brake on public and private extravagance. To clients
and critics.who grumbled about his caution his reply
was “That’s what I’m here for. It’s no part of a
banker’s business to boom things or to help the
people who do the booming.” lie prided himself on
his good memory, which was indeed extraordinary—-
that, he said, and a knack of concentrating on the
matter in hand were his best points as a banker.
French was a fine, courtly, benevolent gentleman, a
good boss and a faithful servant of the bank and
the public. He married a daughter of \V. L. Haw-
kins, manager of the Christchurch branch of the
Bank of Australasia, and there are three children—
one a banker, one a soldier, and the third the wife
of a naval man.
South Aus. has finished its financial year
£303,000 short of the estimated revenue.
This result is mainly due to the absence of
railway traffic on the Broken Hill line; the
estimate assumed that the mines would be
at work long ago. The closing down of
Moonta and Wallaroo helped in the wrong
direction, and a fire at the Port Pirie
smelters was extra bad luck.
Seven months ago when the Stanmore
Preserving Co., Ltd., of Sydney, issued its
seventh lot of annual accounts everything
appeared to be well with it. After laying
aside £lOOO for protection of book debts and

ciation, the disclosed profit permitted 10

naries and then left for reserves an amount
equal to more than 15 p.c. on the ordi-
naries, included with which were £15,000 of
bonus shares issued during the 12 months,
lhe co. had had a wonderful year: disclosed
profits were three times those shown for the
previous year, and more than nine times the
profits for its first year as a public co. But
like many other people who thought that
the boom would last, the Stanmore Preserv-
ing management early in the New Year dis-
covered that it had been prospering in a
fools paradise. The canned-fruit trade col-
lapsed concurrently with the fall in tin-
plate supplies of which had been contracted
~, . “onths ahead. Some smart people
"7 i knowledge forestalled a meeting
ot shareholders recently, and the Ist 10 p.c.
£1 prefs. collapsed to 1.35., the 2nd 10 p.c.
xl prefs. to 4s. 9d. and the £1 ordinaries
to is. On these prices the co., which, on
its last issued balance-sheet and after new
capital had been got in, showed £222,14S
ot net tangible assets, had a market
value of under £50,000. The co.’s
position was put before a meeting of
shareholders last week, but no public state-
has yet been issued by the directors.
Whisperings which have escaped the Board
room fix the less incurred during the past
seven months at about £103,000. of which
tin-plate transactions represented £56 000
and overseas trading losses £lO,OOO or so.’
A further £BOOO may be lost on the tin-
plate deal, while shipments may swallow
another £15,000. The co. apparently also
lost £ll, <OO when the Brisbane Fruit-
growers’ Association, in which it was inter-
ested, went to the wall. The co. had a fire
some months ago from which it collected
insurances.

A shut-down at Lyell has been averted.
Ore-breaking was to have ceased last week
and the smelters were to close as soon as a
clean-up had been completed. But at the
eleventh hour, when Justice Powers had de-
livered judgment, Colli ns-streeti countermanded
the close-down orders. Justice Powers
placed the seal of the Commonwealth Arbi-
tration Court on the proposed arrangement
between the co. and some of the unions to
carry on until the end of the year on the basis
of April wages, underground hours be : ng
fixed nt 48 and 40 on alternate weeks. The
A.W.U. people were not surprised that ac-
countant Frank Hambridge found Mt. Lyell
costs 0.K.; they knew all along that Bowes
Kelly and his team would not be so foolish
ns to fake statements. The move to get
Hambridge was the forlorn hope that he
might find something on which to unpeg
union leaders, who w 7 ere intent on forcing
the staff into idleness unless all demands
were conceded. However, if the unions con-
tinue reasonable and are content with receiv-
ing more than the “full fruits’’ of their
labor —Lyell cannot but make a loss under
the agreement unless the copper market un-
expectedly recovers—the Tas. West Coast
copper-workers are assured of something more
than bread-and-butter for another six
months.
The position at Wallaroo and Mo out a has
also cleared somewhat. The Industrial
Court has rescinded the agreement registered
in November last, so that the wage reduc-
tions proposed in May, and ratified by the
miners in three centres, can operate. So,
despite the A.W.U., 800 men are resuming.
The union bosses at Mt. Morgan are still
holding out for the impossible. The co.
proposed a reduction of 17s. per week in the
minimum wage, but when the Government
offered substantial freight rebates —and thus
undertook to saddle the taxpayer with the
industry’s losses—the co. announced that a
wage reduction of only 4s. would get the big
concern at work again, while labor might
even recover that under a sliding scale pro-
posed in the event of blister prices improv-
ing. But the misguided union executives
have refused to agree, and continue to de-
mand full award rates.
The few White Hope supporters still left
claim that this Hampton Plains show w 11
yet turn out well. In a winze at 70ft. below
the 100 ft. level ore and values pinch to
almost nothing, but 10ft. of core since taken
from a bore at 359 ft. —369 ft. is claimed
to have given llldwt. per ton. The present
cash resources of the co. are said to repre-
sent 6s. per share, and 15,000 tons of ore,
worth, with gold at normal price, 655. per
ton, are declared to be available for stoping.
* * * *
The mill has just bowled out Pernatty
Central, which 12 months ago was declared
to have big, payable lodes and to be one
of the best of the good things on Hampton
Plains. The poor return obtained from the
100 tons treated apparently settles any
claims of the property to be considered a
mine. It also casts a shadow on the possi-
bilities in the adjacent Hampton Celebra-
tion, which was alleged to have riches ex-
posed down to 100 ft.
At Westonia (W.A.), Edna May Central
and Deeps have poor prospects. Central
will have good ore in its bottom level when
the water can be pumped out of the work-
ings. But pumping costs are likely to eat
up any profit there might otherwise have
been in the ore. So far developments in the
No. 7 level at the Deeps have been disap-
pointing, but an improvement at this point
is anticipated. Incidentally, some assistance
is expected from the operations of the Cen-
tral’s oumps, a happening wh : eh will nro-
bably lead to further unpleasantness among
the cos.
After having been baulked at the battery
by the schisty nature of the ore, Edna
Battler (W.A.) has got a cyanide plant at
work and is hoping tor better days. The
campaign up to the time of the stoppage
yielded 480 oz. from 3328 tons, and as the
gold realised only £IS67 it is fairly low
grade. Into the tails 6dwt. per ton is said
to have slipped from the plates, and it is
to catch this that Gudgeon has put on his
thinking-cap. He works out that he has
IS,OOO tons of ore proved, and as his crush-
ings show that he saved 11s. by amal-
gamation, and as residues assay 235. 4d., he
counts up that he can make a hit for the co.
before long. But it will be hard going all
the time.
* * * *
Golden Butterfly’s venture at Southern
Cross (W.A.) is turning out as The Bulle-
tin anticipated. Most of the ore near the sur-
face was gouged out to pay for the mine, and
now only a small block remains and very
little money is left for development. A report
by Grut recommends stoppage of develop-
ment and the treatment of this block to
ascertain the characteristics and real value
of the ore before proceeding further. A pre-
vious report on the show by Grut opined
that the reef and formation and other con-
demns were not good enough for a co. to
tackle, and in the long run Butterfly share-
holders will probably have that conclusion
forced upon them too.

G. P. Doolette has got the London Board
of Sons of Gwal ; a to take on the job of
mining kaolin clays in Cornwall (Eng )
b.v buving a predominating interest in a patch
of 100 acres now owned by the Cornish
Kaolin Co., winch has been winning 12 000
toixs a year of high-grade stuff. Bewick,
Moreing and Co. have bored and sampled the
block, and certify that it contains a big
deposit of much-prized clavs: so the deal
has the office seal on it. Doolette does not
tell how much is lo be sunk in eouipment.
but as the Kaol’n Co. has 151.178 shares of
10s. each unissued out of a total of 240,000,
maybe that is the wad Sons of Gwalia gets
interested in. DoolePe long ago switched
some of the Gwalia cash into the Plymouth
mine, near ’Frisco, where W. J. Loring row
gets his living. That mine, after a period
of agony, has turned out trumps.
■» * -■ * . *
Devon (W.A.) has acquired a battery and
accessories, but for what purpose is not
clear. The ore in sight is a mere bagatel'e,
and when the time comes to start crushing
there w ; ll nrobablv be no money left to open
up further material.
■* *
Waverley (W.A ), which paid something
for nothing at Mt. Monger and then optioned
the Moyagee on the Murchison field, has
decided to give up. Thei’e is some gold
showing in the Moyagee, but it is more suit-
able for two men and a boy than for even
a small co.
Prof. David, of Sydney, who is going thor-
oughly over the mineral possibilities of South
Aus., joins the majority of experts in warn-
ing the enthus'astic minority which diagnoses
oil in the south-eastern part of that State.
The curious rubber-like coorongite found
there is, he says, a mere vegetable product,
a green scum from the bogs, first decomposed
and then solidified. The best sign is that a
deep boi*e at Robe has disclosed a coal for-
mation of the same age as those at Won-
tbaggi (Vic.) and Roma (Q.). Davhl stronglv
advises that S.A. should not spend good
money at present in prospecting, but should
carefully watch the fate of those two shows.
His opinion has, of course, brought prompt
remonstrances from one or two local authori-
ties, Basedow in particular.
* * * *
The Vegetable Creek Tin-mining Co. is
apparently going to have a Lok at Webb’s
silver-mine, near Emmaville (N.S.W.). which
has been idle for many years. Anyhow, the
co. has advertised for 50 cords of wood to
be delivered at the mine, seemingly for
pumping purposes. The shaft is down about
600 ft„ and the usual old miners tell the
usual old story that the ore was becoming
richer when the mine had to shut down on
account of low prices.
* * * *
At least £13.000 has been dropped to date
by W. J. Plain’s Victorian Central Coal and
Iron Mining Co. into the brown-coal forma-
t’on at Lai Lai (Vic.). Boring done by
Stanley Hunter’s crowd discloses that the
extent of the deposit is less than has always
been bel.eved. Plain has the best of tne
area, and has enough of the formation to
see half-a-dozen generations out of Sight.
If pulverised coal comes into general use
Plain will have his chance, provided he can
stand the test of competition from Morwell.
lor the present his followers do not want
Newcastle coal landed cheaply in Melbourne,
so they are making an effort to put the brake
on the Harbor Trust, which proposes to
erect coal-landing appliances at the wharves.
Shrinkage of prices has quietened opera-
tions at the silver-lead shows at Indooroo-
puly, near Brisbane, except in Finney’s Ilill
united, which continues to send away small
tonnages of high-grade ore. Recent lots
averaged 40 p.c. lead and 85oz. silver. Fin-
ney’s deepest workings are now down 200 ft.
in felsite, with ore indications good just
above that depth. The Brisbane Syndi-
cate's lease is under exemption ; an attempt
is being made to rake in cash to go ahead
with development. What lies ahead of this
co. is rather uncertain, but prospects are
fair, as several good bodies of .schist forma-
tion carrying galena have been met in the
shaft down to 120 ft. At the 84ft. level a
10ft. formation has been followed for about
40ft., with patches of galena showing.
Further development is warranted there.
This show recently sent away 20 tons ore
which returned 7 tons lead and 900 oz. silver.
Other leases are simply marking time.
Mt. Quamby (Q.) is behaving in a manner
likely to make the Vic. shareholders uneasy.
Jim Tregenza (Govt. Assayer at Cloncurry)
has been working on samples from the tunnel
which has been driven over 150 ft. into the
conglomerate. The first lot went only a
couple of dwt., but the last assayed from 2oz.
to 3oz. The shareholders are sending a repre-
sentative north to have another look at the
show. The assays bear out Geologist Ball’s
dictum that values are very uncertain in the
boulder rock. It is no field for the small
man.
* * *' ‘ '
Although geologist L. C. Ball gave a
glowing report and a recommendation to
proceed with development by all possible
means, the owners of the Ajax copper-
mine, the promising Central Queensland
show near Bajool, find the way of the cop-
per-miner is not easy at present, and have
secured exemption for six. months. The
ore now at grass is unsaleable, and the
closure at Mount Morgan prevents them get-
ting their ore treated locally, In view of
Ball’s report as to the wonderful promise of
the gossans, the Ajax hopes to secure funds
to thoroughly test the lode and to find a bet-
ter market for the metal at the end of the
exemption period. The surface ore carries
moderate silver values, and there is a chance
of secondary enrichment at a lower level.
Since the Queensland Railways decided
last month to reduce freights on copper ore
from Cloncurry by 75 p.c., attention is being
directed to gouger-shows, and the Mines De-
partment has been kept busy with applica-
tions for assistance from the prospecting
vote. With freights reduced far below cost,
and £ for £ assistance given to cover work
until payable ore is found, there is not much
in it for the State or taxpayer beyond re-
lieving a little unemployment.
Pending the return of high prices Stan-
nary Hills (N.Q.) is putting in time
on development work at the Arbouin, and the
erection of plant and machinery at Derek’s,
which lias a couple of promising ore bodies
to exploit in the Lass o’ Gowrie and the
You and Me. The Rocky Bluffs battery is,
of course, still idle. Derek’s was particu-
larly hard hit by the metal slump, which
occurred just after much money had gone in
treatment plant and blocking out ore. Every-
thing was almost ready for production when
the axe fell.
* * * *
A party prospecting for platinum recently
gave the serpentine belt in Central Queens-
land a good overhaul, paying particular
attention to the drifts from this formation.
No prospects were obtained which could be
considered likely to lead to payable develop-
ments. Platinum is usually associated with
serpentine, and a belt of this country runs
through Cawarral and Canoona, north of
Rockhampton, and down on the Calliope
River, behind Gladstone. Small deposits
of nickel and chromite were found, but
there is no inducement to work these at
present.
* * * -tf
Conditions have improved slightly at
Blair Athol the past few weeks, though no
mine is yet working anything near full
tune. Small shipments of coal have been
sent away, loading being done at the Gavial
Creek wharf, near Rockhampton, while work
is being expedited at Broadmount, so that
the export trade can be handled there. The
last six months has been the worst experi-
enced since the field was opened.
* * * *
Development is proceeding at Mt. Mor-
gan’s colliery at Baralaba (Q.). The first
haulage way has been connected with the
straight shaft, and another tunnel designed
for the main haulage is under way. Another
winding engine has been installed, and the
co. should now be in a position to supply
all its own fuel.
On the Oaks field (N.Q.) Mountain King
is runner-up to Oaks with 700 tons to show
for the past two months’ crushing, as
against 1050 for the old co. Values of
both ran from 9s. to 9s. 6d. a ton. Moun-
tain King ore monopolises the Syndicate
battery, but the State battery should shortly
be in commission. Thompson’s has been
working some rich veins assaying from 2oz.
to 3oz.
* * * *
“J.R.K.”: Notwithstanding the feeble
metal market there are some bright spots in
the tin firmament around Herberton and
Irvinebank (N.Q.). One show r at the latter
centre, McGill and Carroll’s Gordon mine, is
claimed to have 200 tons of 20 p.c. ore at
grass, and is said to be showing better as it
is sunk on. The irony of the find is that the
ore is all within barrowing distance of the
hoppers of the old Agnes battery. At Her-
berton, Eaton’s Bradlgpgh mine is showing a
lode 3ft. wide and 20ft. long, said to go 30
p.c. The old Irishman mine has been resur-
rected, and the three miners who put in
£3OOO to systematically test the ground have
been rewarded with something that looks
like a continuation of the old shoot. One
battery is working half-time for the whole
d’strict, and tin concentrates are stacked in
all directions awaiting better prices.

John Ilussell French, general manager of
the Bank of N. S. Wales, who died last week,
aged 74, loved his little joke at the expense
of the extravagance of the times. The last,
time a Bulletin Wild-Cat man had a talk
with him about the position and the. outlook,
the veteran soon got to the old subject.
“Whenever,” he said, “an application comes
in for an advance and I go through the list
of assets, I run my eye down the schedule to
find the motor-car.”
Tevita Bouletele Tui’ Yakano, Prime Min-
ister and big man of the hundred islands
which make up the kingdom of Tonga, is in
Sydney looking for a new motor-car and a
health resort. Since 1911 lie has been the
political head in the Friendlies—a record
premiership. The late George Tubon 11. was
a hard man with his Cabinet, but in Tevita
he met a strong personality, with a solid
following of young Tongans. Tui Yakano
weathered all the political storms emanating
from George, and he still carries on under
Salote. A product of the white-man-con-
ducted Tonga College at Nukualofa, he has
a sound knowledge of English, and he is
an excention to the average Tongan in that
his ideas on the welfare of the people don't
run altogether in the same channels as those
of the missionary-man. If asked for his
views on the church question, he merely re-
marks “Sai! Oku sai be,” which means that
it really doesn’t matter much, but is quite
all right.
The coastal trade lost a fine skipper when
Alexander Forbes went below with the
steamer Our Jack off Seal Rocks (X.S.W.)
the other day. A Liverpool native, he came
into the Australian trade as a young man,
and few knew the coast better. One of his
“saves” has become a tradition among the
navigators of the northern bars. Many years
back, caught by a terrific inshore blow off
the Manning entrance in the old Electro, he
forced his way stern-first to sea and safety.
■Sitting at his desk in the homestead at
Norwood, the homo ho purchased close on 3(1
years back, old James I’argetcr Cooper passed
( lit on July 4. Born 90 years ago near Bir-
mingham, “Dusty,” as lie was generally
styled in Goulburn (N.S.W.), came to Aus-
tralia as a youth, lie first earned money by
charcoal-burning near Mummoll, but soon by
judicious investments amassed a competency
end later a fortune. The only yarn against
himself which lie appreciated was the one
of the young lady who asked him for a dona-
tion to a certain fund, and lie refused. “Why,
Mr. Cooper,” she said, “Mr. Blank and Mr.
Dash have both given something, and they
can’t afford it as well as you." “No,”
drawled the old man, “that’s why.”
Frank King, just dead at 70 in Adelaide,
had been mayor and holder of pretty well
every other office in sight at suburban Hind-
marsh. But it is as a cricketer that he will
lie most widely remembered. lie was in
first-class club games at 14, and a grown
youth when the Cricket Association started
half a century ago. A fast bowler, with
the old-fashioned round-arm delivery, he was
in all the earliest matches that 8. Aus.
played against Vic. or visiting English
teams; and the Assoc, made him a life-
member nearly 20 years ago.
John McAlister Ilowden, managing-direc-
tor of The Block Arcade (Melb.), one of
the leading spirits of the Victorian land-
boom of 1880-90, has passed out. Ilowden
was the son-in-law of Andrew Lyell, an ac-
countant of much influence in Melbourne,
and the two were partners in the oldest and
biggest finance business in the city. Later
it was reconstructed as the Mercantile
Finance and Guarantee Co. B. J. Fink was
chairman, Andrew Lyell inspector, and J.
McA. Ilowden manager. In most of its
big land deals G. W. Taylor, a Prahran
auctioneer, and Thomas Bent, were asso-

dated. Ilowden was a shrewd, sane man,
with a genius for figures and finance. All-
of them approached the millionaire stage on
paper, but they discounted the future too
largely, and all of them went fut.
George Fairbairn, who, as member for
Toorak in \ ic. Assembly, M.11.R. for Fawk-
uor, and now Senator, has had a varied poli-
tical experience, is threatening to retire from
a job that lias grown irksome. The inner
circle of the National Federation is already
trying to discover a likely successor.

the, Broken Hill Prop.
One of the outstanding figures at the
Trades Union Conference was .Tack Curtin,
formerly tin* boy orator of Melbourne
Trades Hall, but for the last five years
editor of the Westralian Worker. Curtin
is eloquent, studious and desperately in earn-
est, and if he doesn’t kill himself with over-
work (a feat he nearly accomplished at the
last Federal election, when he ran his paper
and conducted a strenuous political cam-
paign at the same time) he will go far. An
anti-militarist, Jack wont to gaol rather
than undergo training under the Defence
Act. All the same, he could sport a rejected
volunteer's bad~e if he liked.
“A. 8.8.”: Skipper Jimmy Colvin, who
went down with the Fitzruy on the N.S.W.
North Coast the other day, was one of the
oldest of our coastal masters. He was
always referred to as "Crowbar Jimmy,”
a handle acquired in his days of matesliip
through a habit of calling for a blanky
crowbar when stowing timber. I remember
him announcing at a presentation to a
brother skipper: “I’ve been in gaol—done a
fortnight in Biloela for refusing duty.” He
was referring to the ’9O strike. “Crowbar”
was then an A.B. in the old Ivallatina, and
was one of a number who were proceeded
against by the X.C.S.X. Co. for refusing
to go to sea at £5 a month. Colvin had been
one of a deputation appointed to interview
the chairman with the object of a rise. To
the argument that a fiver was not enough to
maintain a family on, the deputationists
were advised to turn their women-folk out
washing. They went to gaol instead, and
“Crowbar” among the rest put in his 14
days at the island.
“Wymac” : Few knew that Henry Lindsay,
who died in Melbourne recently, was a
baron. Born in 1834. he was the second
son of Sir Henry Lindsay Bethune, ninth
Earl of Lindsay. He joined the Navy, and
later was supposed to have died of cholera
in France. For some reason he never
denied the rumor, came to Victoria, and
for 00 years worked there, generally as
a farm-hand. In IS7B his father died and
Henry’s elder brother John became tenth
Earl of Lindsay; then John died in
1894, leaving no children, and, because Henry
was supposed to be dead, he was succeeded
by his cousin, David Clarke Bethune. Lat-
terly Lindsay expressed a desire to be
buried with his ancestors, and tried to
return to the Cold Country, but first poverty
and then the Reaper balked him. He was
buried at Coburg. The family baronetcy
dates back ,to 1365.
The name of George Phillips, Queensland
civil-engineer, just dead at 77, is woven into
the history of Bananaland. In 1862 he
became a surveyoi in the Roads Department,
then joined the Landsborough Expedition as
staff surveyor, doing work that made him an
authority on the Gulf Country. He lan
out Xoruianton, and explored the country
southward as far as Cloneurry; then, m
ISP's, be became staff-surveyor for the .Ken-
nedy district, and nine years later entered the
railway service in Brisbane. It was he v\ no
introduced metal sleepers on the Xormanton-
Croydon railway. From 181)3 till 1890 1 hil-
lips looked after Carpentaria's interests in
the Assembly.
Squatter Cory, of Terry -hie-hie (N.S.W.),
whose death was mentioned last week, was
the eldest of a Patterson River family or
11). The youngest is George, manager ot
Gordon Brook, and he is on towards 50.
For Superintendent Priest, who has just
thrown away his uniform after 43 years
service in the S. Aus. Police Force, it is
claimed that he was the first detective to
adopt tlie finger-print system in Aussie. __ He
is gifing to spend his retirement <>n Kan-
garoo Island.
Death took a hand at the wheel of a
North Sydney ferry-boat in a big storm last
week. A Manly ferry skipper who happened
to be aboard the Ivirrule noticed that the
boat was zig-zagging curiously, and, racing
up to the steering cabin to see what was
wrong, found Captain Hall dead on the floor.
He had collapsed while standing at the
wheel. Hall was .">7 years old and had been
in the service of the ferries since boyhood.
I)r. Leonard Bickle, though he died in
Sydney, was, by his own wish, taken back
to Adelaide for burial. He came from Lou-
don hospitals to South Aus. in INN 4, and had
been prominent nearly ever since, taking a
special interest in the medical side of mili-
tary work.
Captain Herbert Wilson, whose X. S.
Wales estate was valued for probate last
month at £!Hi,(100-odd, was, like liis brother
Gordon, who was killed earlier in the war,
one of the most Anglicised Australians that
ever lived. At Eton, where they were sent as
very small boys, their country of origin was
dimly suspected for a year or so, and then
all memory of it passed away. They became
typical cavalrymen, joined White's Club, and
the elder married the daughter of a duke.
Lady Sarah Wilson (aunt of the divorced
Duke of Marlborough, who re-married the
other week) was one of the best-known
women in South Africa during the closing
stages of the Boer War. The brothers paid
hurried visits to Victoria from time to time,
in accordance with a provision in the will
of their millionaire father, old squatter
“Salmon” Wilson.
N. S. Wales Agricultural Minister Dunn’s
journalist-brother, E.J., lias crossed over to
Sydney from Westrulia, where he edited the
Perth edition of Truth ; before that he
was sub-editor of Brisbane Daily Standard.
E.J. is a rufous-haired humorist who speaks
as picturesquely as he writes, but he hasn’t
had W.F.’s luck in politics. Their father,
by the way, was Yorkshire-born.

WHEN THE PARSON VISITS ME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I've a friend in holy ordevs who at times thiims
thoughts unholy—
Who occ .sionally wearies of his stale theology ;
When he feels the fit is coming, lo! he girdeth up
his brolly—
Aye, the parson jambs his hat on, and he straight-
way visits me.
My venetian-tinted villa is the haven that ho hies
to—
It is here 1 write my verses and my articles and
pars;
It's a cosy little cottage, and a perfect Paradise,
too—
There is liquor in the cupboard, and there’s stacks
of good cigars:
Here 1 * spin in spider-fashion from the morning
unto even;
Here 1 agitate my garden with my trowel placidly ;
lint my quiet life is tinctured with a glad,'empha-
tic leaven —
Aye, my frugal home grows festive when the parson
visits me 1
From my cosy workroom window l can see my cleric
coming,
And ! put the pars away then, and I furl my busy
pen:
Soon the knocker beats the door-plate with a gild,
insistent drumming.
And I greet my shepherd, warmly as I take him to
my den;
There he drops the priestly habit with a cheerful
sort of clatter —
He's a reverend no longer; he’s a plain and pleasant
man.
Aye, he looks as much a preacher as a saint looks
like a satyr—
He forgets about HeCrshebu and Jerusalem and Dan;
He forgets the weighty sermon and flic Creed and
Catechism —
He remembers that lie’s human, and he palpitates
with glee.
When he tilts the pagan wine-jar he abandons sect
and schism —
Ha! the house is filled with gladness when tire
parson visits me 1
Through tire literary meadows in a leisured style
we wander
Picking poppies as we saunter o’er the fields of
Poesy;
Through the realms of Prose we ramble to the
mountains over yonder,
Where old Emerson and Tally gaze across the glow-
ing sea.
In an armchair sits the shepherd, glass in hand, and
slowly smoking- -
Ho! he puffs the curling rings up like a real
Bohemian !
And he scintillates and (lashes with his gibing and
his joking—•
1 regard him as a godsend, my ideal clergyman.
How we talk and how we travel with De Maupassant
and Daudet —•
How we trample on the carcasje of Conventionality.
We delete the dross of custom, and we cast out
sham and shoddy,
And with joy the air is laden when the parson visits
me!
I esteem him as a brother, and I wish he’d come
more often—
Aye, I wish he’d leave the lectern and the blizzard
o! bazaars ;
In the world most clerics drowse in iron brains
would surely soften —
There is peace and sweet nepenthe ’mid the glasses
and cigars'.
Fancy drinking tea for pastime with the prudes
and “proper” people—
Fancy prattling Dorcas meetings to the angular
Miss Jones !
Seek the sunshine, all you clerics -leave the cold
shade of the steeple—
Let the dear delight of living filter through your
marrow-bones !
Try to feel as he and [ do, when wo swap the
cheerful stories,
As we sit around the fireside till the hours grow
extra wee ;
Feel the star-breath rushing past you on the mental
promontories—-
As I feel it bounding by me when the parson visits
me !

SOCIETY
HE'D TESTED HER FOR SPEED.
"I've got the fastest typist in the city."
"Well, that's the only complaint I have
against mine.”
“Henry Horsecollar”: I had on my pre-
mises for three days recently one of the
causes of our diminished production and (in
consequence) of our ruinously large importa-
tion of cheap-labor, non-union, discolored
and mixed goods. In other words, I had an
electrical workman in the house accom-
panied by his retinue, suite or “laborer.”
According to the etiquette of the business
nowadays, no skilled workman of the least
importance will go anywhere except with
his “laborer” trapesing after him. In three
days I saw the suite remove a ladder morn-
ing and evening, shut a manhole, and hand
up two bits of metal to his superior. As the
suite’s pay isn’t so very much less than the
mechanic’s, the addition to the cost of the
job must have been considerable. At one
time in the dim wastes of Long Ago the big
man, when he required an aide, was accom-
panied by an apprentice—a hopeful youth
who was learning the trade. There seem to
be few or none such now, and the artisan’s
off-sider is a disappointed middle-aged adult
who never learned anything in particular
and is too old to begin. Naturally the cost
of living is high when two men have to be
paid for one man’s job. Naturally produc-
tion is low r , which means that imports are
enormous. And I suppose it is because so
many men are trained to the looking-on
trade that if you advertise for a man to
shovel wind the street is a solid mass of
applicants, whereas I had recently to wait
two weeks for a plastering expert, he being
a scarce person and engaged three deep. My
looker-on was a patient man and I supplied
him with a table to lean against. He might
have sat down frankly on the chair which
accompanied the table and I wouldn’t have
objected, but I suppose it isn’t the correct
thing to abandon the erect attitude which
suggests business.
* * * *
“Onlooker”: Even the thieves and rooks
of the community begin to talk the jargon
of the “class-conscious” Labor boss. At
Innisfail (N.Q.) the other day two men
enticed a victim to the rear ot a hotel and
went through his pockets. They drew a
blank; whereupon one of the disappointed
searchers delivered a succession of uppercuts,
remarking: “les, you’re one of the s
who keep us poor.”
“Booleroo”: “Friday Island” (B.
23/G/’2l) noints out that Stegomyia fasciata,
which carries yellow fever, has been found
in Australia. These “tiger mosquitoes, ’ as
they are called, are very common around
Brisbane throughout the year, and it’s an
even bet that if you catch 10 skeeters six of
them will be “tigers.” The trouble is that these
are house mosquitoes, i.e., they breed in and
around houses, in old jam-tins, beer-bottles —
in fact, any old thing that will hold water
for a few weeks —so that to eradicate them
each and every householder will have to do
his bit in destroying their breeding-places.
American experience has shown that exten-
sive malaria-control measures, such as drain-
ing swamps, oiling ponds, etc., which are
necessary to destroy anophelines, the malaria-
carriers, are quite unnecessary for the de-
struction of stegomyia. I agree with “1 nday
Island” that a Commonwealth mosquito
survey is necessary, but we won t advance fni
till the man in the street is taught the danger
of skeeters and how to prevent them breed-
ing in his own back yard.
“Morob” wants elbow-room :
There was a time, and not so long ago, when
students who attended classes in clinical medicine
at metropolitan hospitals did so in small groups
of three and four. A clinic of more than half a
dozen, including the honorary instructor, was rare.
Students were then able to acquire a knowledge
of the cases, both because their hon-
orary had more time to describe
them, and because they were able to
make a personal examination of the
patient, and, by means of questions,
clear up any doubtful points. Now-
adays the average clinic is liable to
contain anything between 30 and 40
members, more than half of whom
get no more than a distant glimpse
at a case. Honoraries, because of
the crowding, have less time than
formerly, and the student who held
up the proceedings by asking ques-
tions would run the risk, of being
regarded as a dangerous time-waster ;
while even the mildest-mannered
patient would be likely to object to
being pawed about by 30 pairs of
unskilled hands, even supposing time
permitted of the pawing. The fact
is that, while the number of students
at every medical school in Australia
has increased enormously, no pro-
visions have been made for the in-
crease, and both University and hos-
pital authorities are trying to deal
with present-day conditions with the
means of a bygone period. The
obvious solution is to build
university hospitals, where selected cases may be
sent for purposes of instruction, while any overflow
could be- dealt with by means of small clinics in
the city hospitals. This plan is in vogue in prac-
tically every medical university outside those of
Australia.
* * * *
“Clutha”: Assuming the published and so
far as I know uncontradicted report of his
evidence is correct, Admiral Clarkson is either
lamentably ignorant or trying to mislead
the Commission which is inquiring into the
Cockatoo Island and Garden Island dock-
yards. The words they say he used were :
“Every nation in the world makes it a sine
qua non that refitting and naval construction
must be the responsibility of naval men,”
and “it is work of such vital importance
that it is impossible to delegate it to civi-
lians.” What, then, of the works of Arm-
strong-Whitworth, John Brown, Beardmore,
Fairfield, Thornycroft, Vickers, J. S. White?
All are conducted by mere civilians, yet they
have been delegated to turn out hundreds of
our finest naval vessels. The British Admi-
ralty has never in its own dockyards built
and completed one single fighting ship. In
“THANK GOD, THAT'S SETTLED !”
“Where arc those hills I've not to pay to-
morrow?”
“ Dearest, I fixed them. I saw how they
worried you, so I burned them
the Iloyal Dockyards at Portsmouth,
Devonport and Chatham hulls are built, but
the machinery—more expensive and as vital
as the hull—is manufactured and installed
by private firms. Even the tonnage built in
these establishments is a very small fraction
of the total output each year. How many
of the ships iu our Australian Navy were
built by naval men? Only the very expen-
sive products of Cockatoo. Who built the
Renown, the last battleship the Admiral saw
—or the Hood, the last word in fighting
ships? Civilians! In pre-war days were
not many fine warships for Japan, Chile,
Turkey and other foreign countries designed
and built by purely commercial firms in the
Cold Country? “Every nation in the world,”
he says. In the U.S.A. in 1920 110 naval
vessels of all classes totalling 91,000 tons
were constructed in 12 private shipyards,
and at the end of last year in Japan two
private firms were each constructing a
battle-cruiser, and two other firms were
building a light cruiser each.
* * * *
“Adelaide”: Vested Interests received an-
other jolt in Adelaide last week. The old
original railway to Glenelg started in the
middle of King William-street (two chains
wide, and without much traffic in its south-
ern half-mile), and ran down it like a non-
stop tram, ringing a big bell. A
few years back this plan was
vetoed as a relic of the Dark
Ages, and the trains were
pushed back to the city boun-
dary ; but travellers were sup-
posed to have a moral right t< •
be conveyed to and from the old
spot, and the Tramways Trust
was paid a lump sum to carry
them so far. Also the old
ticket-office was kept up. It is
now to be abolished, and the
free ride, too. Nobody should
suffer much, apparently, for
even the old terminus was
not in the business centre of the city,
and most people already ignore the free-ride
privilege, paying a one-section fare to travel
right up to the banks. But V.I. resents the
jolt, and Glenelg is holding indignation meet-
ings.
* * * *
“Friday Island” : Further evidence of un-
charted rocks in the Torres Strait may be
found in the visitors’ book at a mission-
station in the strait. Here, opposite the
signature of the skipper of a naval patrol
vessel which was nosing round those parts
in the war, appears in the “remarks” col-
umn: “Arrived overland as usual.” The
Admiralty chart shows a light on Proudfoot
Shoal, but there hasn’t been a glimmer on
that risky spot for three years. The patent
apparatus for an “unattended” light has been
lying at Brisbane —and it looks as if it will
go on being unattended until a second Quetta
disaster wakes the authorities.

“M.D.” on mistakes in medical names:
The cables came a bad crash a
week or two ago when, reporting
the “mysterious illness” of an
ex-Australian, Lady Leigh, they
confused two utterly dissimilar
diseases—sleeping sickness and
encephalitis lethargica. The
former is due to the presence of
trypanosomes in the blood and
central nervous system, the host
being the African tsetse fly, while
the latter is a low-grade inflam-
mation at the base of the brain
of infective origin. Sleepiness
being a leading symptom, medical
men gave the disease the clumsy
name of lethargic encephalitis,
although paralysis of the eye
muscles is also a prominent symp-
tom, and there is usually some
fever. There was an epidemic of
it a little more than a year ago
in England, and at Montpellier,
in France. Some of the victims
of the malady, after a few days
in bed, got up and walked about
during the rest of the
illness, but eventually
were driven to consult an
oculist owing to the eye
trouble. There were many
fatalities. Why don’t doc-
tors call it somnolent in-
flammation of the brain,
and be done with it? That
term would be near
enough, would be intelli-
gible, and would prevent
silly mistakes in the
cables.
“Wodgil” : Writing no doubt from a mar-
supial point of view, "Moe” (B. 16/6/’2l)
asserts that “there is no such thing as an
aspirin habit.” Well, thousands of Austra-
lian women have developed an uncommonly
good imitation of one. Also, a Harley-street
physician, quoted by London Daily Express,
affirms that “with many people the taking
of aspirin has reached the stage of drug ad-
diction,” and adds that the aspirin dope-fiend
is one of the most difficult or patients, owing
to the fact that he or she utterly fails to
realise the dangerous potency of the drug,
“which has a particularly harmful effect on
the heart.” In Capetown, according to the
Express, there is a movement to have as-
pirin placed on the poison schedule: and
the paper’s Harley-street physician ap- ;
proves. Certainly some restraint is neces-
sary to save the neurotic, aspirin-doped
female, who is such a sore trial to a
harassed world, from the consequences of
her own credulity.

“Addo ”: Re “Emsee’s” mystery of the
Stokes gun (B. 23/6/’2l). I can probably
account for Fritz not making use of the gun.
Immediately prior to the arrival of the raid-
ing party, the squareheads nut over a heavy
box barrage which effectively obliterated all
trace of the section
of the line in which
the gun was stationed,
so it is more than
likely Fritz never
saw ir.
PITCHING THE OLD TALE.
“ Here's the doctor to see yon, sir.”
“I can't see him—tell him I'm ill.”
“0.K.”: The casual Australian way of
breaking minor laws and scouting regulations
has its humorous side. Collingwood (Melb.)
Council was discussing the invasion by trot-
ting fiends of a local public park, where they
have formed a circular training track. One
councillor suggested that a notice-board
should be erected, warning these trespassers.
He was told that the board had been put up,
with the worst possible result. They had
used it as a starting-post.

DREAM ON!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The dream that’s dreamt by one to-day
Tile world may hold to-morrow ;
So, dreamer, hope—take heart of hope,
In spite of toil and sorrow !
No good thing dies, but evermore
Lives on, and grows forever;
The little creek becomes a stream,
The stream an ample river.
So, dreamer, hope—lake heart of hope,
Though set with thorns be thy way ;
The little track becomes a road,
The road a rolling highway.
The Future, like a kindly friend,
Bends down to save and cherish;
Though blackened skies above thee gloom,
Let not the Vision perish!
The dreamer of a noble dream.
Though cold he grow and breathless,
He cannot die, he shall not die,
For that his dream i« deathless.
Who sows the seeds of goodly deeds
On faith and hope relying,
Shall still live on in flower and fruit,
The shafts of time defying.
Who dug and hewed in Babylon,
And dreamt of love made real,
Though dust he be and dcscrt-ldown,
Lives still in his ideal.
Time cannot dull the gold of dreams,
Nor make them aged and hoary;
They may not fade, they may not pass.
Immortal is their glory.
Though «coffed at, scorned and thrust aside
By caste or creed or nation,
They wait, and, waiting, mould their hour
Of splendid revelation.
Dream on, though mist-like be thy dream,
And dim thy hope, and slender;
The mist in time becomes a cloud,
The cloud a morning splendor.

“Bat”: Another monument to Digger
initiative. In December, 1918, when Hie
A.I.F. units were madding it IMiinewards,
the Eggs-a-Cook Division marched in threes
instead of the usual fours, on account of
congested traffic on the roads. Then the
innovation was passed on to our division,
which led to a lot of experimenting among
company officers as to the best way of get-
ting tiie Digger into the new formation, as
the drill-book said nothing about it. The
very first day our brigade was to move out
in threes the General chanced to be up ou«
battalion end. On the command to move
being given, three companies at once became
a mass of chaotic shuffling, but the fourth
company seemed to glide into the new forma-
tion as to the manner born. The O.C. of
the fourth company—notoriously a bad
drill soldier—was sent for, and on being
questioned as to what command he gave to
get the men so quickly into threes, replied,
rigidly at attention: “‘lnto threes get,’ sir!”
“Mug Gunner’’: Diggers are never tired
of getting one in on Tommy; but many a
time Tommy did things that even the Digger
envied. A patrol of 26 of the Hampshire
Regiment in North Russia, while scouring
some heavily-timbered country, captured 40
enemy droskys, whose drivers told them there
was a detachment of about 50 in the forest
not far away. As they had a couple of
Lewis-guns with them the “t’hooms” decided
to give it a fly. When they got in touch
with the detachment they opened up on it,
only to find that it was 800 strong, and able
to lap round them. They
stuck together, nevertheless,
and cut a way through, despite
the fact that 400 more of the
enemy joined in. Iland-to-hand
fighting was the order of the
day, and one Tommy »ot nine
with his bayonet.

* Homes might elaborate the idea
ot a Cold Country hostess I’ve just heard from
who believes that cakes and chatter, scones
and scandal should be combined with some-
thing useful. Instead of sitting down and
qualifying for an early arterio-sclerosis by
imbibing unlimited tea, the guests could
learn many handy wrinkles and pocket-saving
devices, were it only the putting to rights
of a crippled Venetian blind, tacking down
a recalcitrant carpet, or infusing a sense of
tone into a door-bell that had suddenly become
dumb. There’s no real happiness in listen-
ing to lectures on psycho-analysis when the

COMIC ARTIST (who has had his drawings rejected): “Look here, sir, I was submitting
comic drawings to the paper before you were born.”
EDITOR: "I don't doubt, it. I think my grandfather teas familiar with most of those
you've shown me.”
electrician’s an<l plumber’s bills are gnawing
at you. Why uot, by a few lessons in the
easy industrial arts, learn to do ordinary
household jobs yourself? The plan is to
invite a gasfitter, electrician, carpenter, etc.,
to give lessons for an hour or two at the
different homes. It’s a good idea, and only
wants a society economist to give it a push.
“Cartot”: There is practically nothing
that the dipso,, will not drink, providing it
contains something in the way of alcohol.
An elderly chemist’s assistant
was admitted to a Melbourne
institution for treatment, his
troubles having reached a crisis
through a prolonged bout on
corn-cure, which his employer
manufactured in bulk, and
which, in addition to 10 per
cent, of alcohol, contained col-
lodion and salicylic acid. The
use of the compound tincture
of camphor is common among
those able to obtain it. A
Sydney private hospital once
had a lady patient of consider-
able social weight who used to
go on a jag on Parma violets
and Jockey Club perfumes.
She confided to me just before
her discharge that for some-
thing with a real kick there
was nothing to come up to
Opoponax. Another lady,
under ”0. while confined in
an inebriates’ home, puzzled
all hands by mysteriously get-
ting on a bender, despite the officials’ watch-
fulness. Eventually it was found that she
used to draw on the liquid fuel in the reser-
voir of a small spirit stove in her room.
“Akenehi” remembers a day:—
Somerset Maugham is going to Banda-Neira! A
friend of mine lately went to Heaven and got a
good seat in the nine-choir stalls. But I don’t
envy her. I do envy Somerset Maugham his visit
to Banda. His “The Moon and Sixpence” shows
his appreciation of the sensuous enchantment of
tropic isles. Well, after Banda has put her
spell upon him he'll surely write “Paradise and a
Nutmeg.” I for one will understand whence he
gets his title —which is more than I do of “The
Moon and Sixpence.”
Banda (Neira is the village extension) is in the
East Indian Archipelago, and she has 10 or II
sisters. The Dutch liner swam through a sea the
color of benedictine and of the clarity of crystal, in
whose depths glowed strange sea-flowers. There
were orchidaceous (good word!) growths the color
of sealing-wax shot with sapphire. There were
emerald lilies and stalks that looked to be carry-
ing pink corn and violet rice. The last few hundred
yards to the emerald jewel lying on the breast of
this flowering sea are made in a boat. The rest
is sheer beauty, charm and peace.
And memories of history! One wide road runs
around the island—it is only a tiny island, remem-
her—and it is canopied with canari-trecs. Natives
were sweeping the road with twig brooms. A pic-
turesque ruin or two. The remains of a Portu-
guese fort and a church with graves beneath its
flagstones. Star-eyed native children (there is an
admixture of Portuguese blood) around a centuries-
old well, or selling fruit or fish. Marble bungalows
with tessellated pavements—shall I ever forget the
enormous double-blossomed crimson hibiscus burning
against the blinding white marble of an enclosed
garden?
There was a guide, a gentle half-caste Arab. “In
the 17th century,” he murmured, (for it was the
hour of the siesta—intensely hot and still), “the
Dutch wrested these islands from the Portuguese.
They were of enormous value for the nutmeg and
the mace monopoly. It was punishable by death
to grow nutmegs on other Dutch possessions. At
the end of the 17th century this island was a minia-
ture Paris. The marble you see in these palaces
was brought from Carrara; but much more has
been carried off to Holland and elsewhere. The
Dutch also brought ovci splendid horses and car-
riages and”
“What for? Where would they drive?”
“It was for fashion—-they just stood their equi-
opposite each other’s bungalows.... Should
you, madarne, think of a. stay in Banda that palace
you just approved could be secured to you for
about l;>s. a month, and the hotel nearby—just
there amongst the palms—would feed you for not
more than lOd. a day.”
This was some 12 years ago. Perhaps now H.C.1..
obtains in Banda as elsewhere. The nutmeg and
mace export still continues. Mace is the delicate
lace undervest of the nutmeg.
An Arab pearl-merchant seemed to be the greater
potentate of the place. He introduced us to several
of bis wives—one was Chinese —and a mob of
daughters. Wives and daughters alike .were an
affiont to the island of beauty. The lessor poten-
tate was the Dutch Resident; there was hardly an-
other white inhabitant.
“Dido”: To (let’s say) John Brawn-, of
Stepping Stones, belongs whatever credit
attaches to the most eccentric proposal of
marriage ever propounded in the State of
\ letoria. John, surnamed the Silent, was a
preternaturally solemn young man of nearly
•:>O, with fluffy chin whiskers and an appear-
ance of holding interesting communion with
himself in the corner to which he invariably
resorted when in company. The occasion
was a meeting of the local Band of Hope.
The; Misses Smith had rendered their
familiar duet and the chairman was about
to make some announcement or other, when
Brawn invaded the platform, and assumed
Brother Tregaskis’s functions. He held up
his hand, and, speaking very deliberately,
said: "Ladies and gentlemen, I beg to pro-
pose that Miss Joan Henderson marry me.”
He paused for a moment, and added: “Any
seconder?” There was a silence of complete
consternation for half a minute; then a man
upheaved in the centre of the hall, and said
"I beg to second that motion.” It was Dan
Henderson, Joan’s father. Brawn spoke
again with due solemnity. “Proposed and
seconded,” said he, “that Miss Joan Hender-
son marry Mr. John Brawn. All in favor
say ‘Aye.’ The contrary ‘Xo.’ ” He looked
steadily at Joan. Her hand did not go up
with the noes. “The ayes have it!” said
Brawn.

“T.H.K.”: It wasn’t only in his slanguage
that the Digger was original. The name
Rue de Kauga, given to a prominent street
in l'eronne when the Aussies occupied that
town in 1918, always struck me as a bril-
liantly-humorous idea.

Dear Bulletin, —You can say what you
like about the advantages of decentralisation,
but your various articles on the subject do
not shake my conviction that the N. S. Wales
policy of pushing everybody and everything
into Sydney is a wise protection against revo-
lution. Sydney trams, thank the Lord, have
made Sydney a city inhabited by savages,
who trample on each other’s feet, and jostle
and push and crush without compunction. I
have just seen a one-legged soldier knocked
over while trying to board one of them, two
tired-looking women and several children
swept aside by athletic-looking barristers, and
a frail old man jnmbed hard into a corner
by an ornate female from a wine-bar. The
spectacle has so strengthened my belief that
Communism is a dud in Sydney that I have
invested a further sum of .'ls. (kl. in gilt-edged
securities. —Yours, B. de F. Chesterfield.
“T. 0.1.” on a notable birth :
On May 21 Sydney had used coal-gas for 80 years.
The fathers of ga* in Australia were two parsons—
ii. Sydney Ralph Mansfield and in Melbourne John Ait-
ken. in 1830 Mansfield presided over a meeting in
Sydney to talk gas, and in the following year Gov.
Bourke assented to an Act of Council creating the
co. Mansfield was the first secretary. At a meeting
in April, 1838, to make a second call (Colonel Shad-
forth was in the chair), several new shares were
taken up and £243 was paid at the table. An early
directors’ report remarked: “The co. has now estab-
lished itself on a firm footing and the directors have
pleasure in reporting that since their election in
December the number of shares purchased and upon
which a deposit of £1 had actually been paid was
;238, making a total of £lO2B on a pledged capital
cf £8200.” Other shares had been bespoken and the
directors “had little doubt that as the active opera-
tions of the co. advanced the- confidence of the public
would be so effectually secured that the whole of the
shares would be readily disposed of.’’ Up till this
the directors had no site for their works, and the
Leg. Council timidly prohibited the erection of
gasometers within the town boundaries. This diffi-
culty, however, was got over; but it was not until
May 24, 1841, that a start was made in the production
of gas. “As a humble expression of loyalty, the
directors selected her Majesty’s birthday, and author-
ised tlie supply of gas for that night only to he
free of charge.” The prices at the start were:
10-hole burner, from dusk till 9 o’clock, six
nights a week, 205.; from dusk till 10 o'clock,
six nights a week, 4 os. ; 'l6-hole burner, 40s. and
60s. respectively ; if burned on Sunday one-sixth to
be paid in addition; jet for hall or passage from
dusk till 11 o’clock, seven nights a week, 20s. This
system existed for about 10 years, then meters were
introduced and 255. per 1000 ft. was charged. The
co. in its 80 years lias had only four secretaries.
Mansfield held the reins until his own 80 year? in-
duced him to resign in 1879 after 43 years’ service:
he was succeeded by William Johnston, who resigned
in 1894, to be followed by R. J. Lukey, who retired
a couple of years ago and made way for C. U. B.
Gurnett, the present sec.
A THREE-BALLS TRAGEDY.
M CSROUT: “Bat I only gave yon that over-
coat four days ago. Rats couldn’t have
got away with it so soon.”
Mc LEAN: “It’s a fact, old man. Night be-
fore last they chewed up the ticket.”
THE BARRACKER
(When female football is all the rage ).
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Play was on, the hefty gills
Were rampaging on the grass ;
Muddy-faced, with tattered curls,
All there furiously yelling.
ltoared the crowd, the players telling.
“Tread her in; she is no class!”
“Break their necks!” “Pass ’em out!”
“Susie, give her jills a clout!”
“Bash ’em!” “Smash ’em!” “.Tear ’em down!”
Shook the windows in the town.
Giggs was there, and Giggs was red,
Hot and agitated too.
Fearful were the things he said,
And his object still more shocking,
Howling, scoffing, cursing, mocking.
“Biff the umpire! Run her through!
Kit, you’ve got a boot to give her!
Stick a hatpin in her liver!
Now you’ve got her licked all but —
Jump upon her chest, you mutt!”
Jumping, jostling, wild of eye,
Brandishing a mighty fist,
Roaring as the game went by:
“Fix the umpire, donahs. Prick her,
Give her nothin’, bite her, kick her!”
Like an angry snake he hissed
If a lady missed a chance
In the umpire’s hair to dance.
For as umpire there he saw
His athletic ma-in-law.

A SAFE PROTECTOR
ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES - LINSEED OIL
“Baree” : Bob Macdonald (“Black Mac”)
has a special cuiv c for the inventor of the census
paper. He is Chief Protector of Aboriginals of the
N.'i*, lias to fill up about 600 forms for abos. under
his immediate charge, and has to cheek all forms
filled in by other protectors in the Territory. And
Binglii’s relationships take some untangling. “This
one allabout mamma longa me,” one lubra stated.
“Than one little feller mamma; this one mamma
halflonga me, halflonga Jateky.” Then Mac. had to
sort out the age last birthday, the period of mar-
riage and date of last marriage, the children, alive
or dead, and file religion.; and long before half-
way through he began to wear a worried look. When
Solomon has three wives, and one wife of Solomon’s
is also a wife to Miranda; when Minnie has five
children, “two b’long Peter, one b’long Harry, two
b’long Tommy,” the official forms fall far short of
requirements. “1 bin marry Dick close up 100 year
now,” said one dusky young matron, whose Dick
looked about 19. “i bin 23 year old, boss; I bin
haveum one feller boy. Him close up 50 now, boss.”
Mac. gave that up.
“1.H.M.”: In reply to “Wandi” and
“J.T.0.” (B. 2C/5/’2l) I would like to quote a case.
A bird-catcher in the Broken Hill district found
two young galahs and a cross between a eorella and
a galah in the same hollow tree. The cross was
reared and lived for four years in captivity. When
full-grown it was a striking mixture of the two
birds. The upper surface was pa’.e grey, being
lighter than that of the galah; the under surface
was salmon pink except under the wings and tail,
which were yellow as in the galah. Pink car coverts
and a pure white crest finished the make-up.
“Jim Garew”: “Dean’s” Orpington hen
(B. 9/6/’2l) who retired to the scrub while moun-
ting did it not because she was modest, but for
self-protection. When a hen is moulting she is
generally off-color, and her sisters are not slow at
paying off old scores when she can’t tight back ; con-
sequently they peek her at every opportunity—
and these pecks ran be demned unpleasant on the
naked skin.
“Morob”: Probably the lirst case of rat-
bite fever in Australia was treated in the Geraldton
(W.A.) Hospital recently. In all parts of Asia
the disease is fairly common, and the
Geraldton patient was a sailor on a
ship which had come from Java. The
disease is transmitted by the bite of
the Asiatic variety of rat, Mus decu-
man tie. The European variety, Mus rat-
tvs is believed to be quite innocent, but
up till the present no organism iso-
lated from any lesion in people suf-
fering with the complaint (which is
much the same as any other fever,
except that the patient invariably
comes out in large blue or cyanosed
spots) has been definitely pronounced
the causatory organism of the disease.
In Asia the fever sometimes becomes
epidemic. Within a couple of years
a number of cases have made their
appearance in Northern Europe, where
previously it was entirely unknown.
This has been ascribed to the fact
that since the warships from Asia
have visited these northern countries
in great numbers the large, loath-
some rat of Asia has wiped out the
smaller and more cleanly European
rat. Lately rats easily identified as
belonging to a Japanese variety have
been found not only in French seaport
towns but inland, and since the
Japanese rat is the most prolific
spreader of rat-bite fever the French
health authorities have started a wai
of extermination against him. It would be well for
our own health-officers to look into the matter. It
is hard work driving out an enemy after he has
become entrenched.
“Alex’’: “Merlin” (B. 16/6/’2l) says the
yarn about the loose morals of cats and rabbits is
about as likely as that of the crossing of cats and
wallabies. That’s where I join in. At the Rail-
way Hotel, Brandon (N.Q.), I saw a cat, mousey
grey in color, with two short forelegs and a thick,
tapering-to-a-point tail, sitting on its haunches a la
wallaby. It propelled itself from place to place in
the same manner as the marsupial. Although it
consumed flesh, it was very partial to lettuce, cab-
bage, carrots and other vegetables. It was socially
ostracised by all the cats in the neighborhood, and
never mewed. Seeing is believing.
“Delhi”: Here on the Dorrigo (N.S.W.)
the rabbit is increasing fast and apr.a-ent!y nothing
is being done to check the plague. Evidently the policy
is to wait until there are thousands where there are
now tens and then start to clear them out of shire
ground. The shire councils took precisely the same
stand with the blackberry, and the eradication of
that pest is now almost beyond their resources.
SAVING THE EXPENSE AND GETTING THE BENEFITS.
PERCY-fROM-H OME: Good Lord, old bean, d’yru mean V nay you're no ambition to leave
your home and go and have a look a, the world’s sights?”
BILLYJAMES: “ Urgh, we get enough of ’em come ’ere to look at us.”
“Norbell”: A Digger mate, who is trying
hard to be a cocky, writes me from Pullen l'uue...
near Imlooroopilly (Q.) : “1 can hear the dingoes
howling as 1 write, and yet we are only 10 ini.es
from the Brisbane G.P.0.” But I dunno. Perhaps
it was Fihelly making a few remarks after reading
what the Judge and others said about him in the
Kyan-MuRCURY case.
“Quandary”: Allow me to introduce to
“Jim Carew” as a more than middle-aged horse-
breaker 70-year-old Andy McNamara, of 'femora
(N.S.W.). On a recent Sunday afternoon Andy
caught, handled and rode two reputed outlaws, seven
and eight years old respectively, which had previously
beaten all-comers. Unlike “Joe’s” nomination (B.
9/6/’2l) he is not one of the gentle-Annie type. He
believes in giving his mounts a sporting chance, and
has been known to encourage a too-doeile youngster
by tying a branch to its tail before getting aboard.
“Wessel”: The rabbit has reached the
Northern Territory. Unlike the Federal Govern-
ment he has tackled it from the south and so far
hasn’t got to the northern parts. A Lands official
recently found many traces of him in the granite
country of the Davenport Ranges, away to the north
of the Macdonnell Ranges, east of the O.T. line.
“Half-moon”: Here are the countries
represented in a wharf-lumping gang that lately
worked a steamer at Thursday Island: Britain,
Russia, Germany, Denmark, Greece, Ceylon, Malay
States, South Se.a Islands, Philippine Islands, Chile,
Torres Strait Islands and Japan. I fancy there was
an Australian or two sandwiched in. They all get
award rates.
“Billy T.” : The river was up at Tincan.
The water had come down from Ridgeways like a
solid wall, and on the second day was whirling past
the township, carrying live stock and debris. The
flood was only six inches below the Tincan bridge,
and great dry logs were butting into it, threatening
to carry it away at any moment. At this stage
Fanning arrived, charging furiously through the flood
and mud. Fanning told his breathless tale to the
men watching to see the bridge carry away. “Thomp-
son was caught in the flood at Pumpkin Flat. I
couldn’t do anythin’ to help him there, so I yelled
I’d ride on and head him off at the bridge.” Pump-
kin Flat was seven miles back. Naturally Thompson
had not arrived. The others did not look forward to
an early call, but Fanning was sanguine. He secured
a 12-foot length of half-inch rope, turned a slip-knot
with a big noose in it, and, sitting on the bridge-
iail, commenced his long vigil, fishing for Thomp-
son. Two days later Rogers riding across Pumpkin
Flat discovered Thompson mending his dog-leg fence,
chains of which had floated into the low country.
“Hello!” said Rogers, “what are you doin’ here?”
“What should I be doing anywhere else ?” responded
Thompson. “Well, I dunno,” Rogers said, “but Fan-
ning is down on the bridge at Tincan flshin’ for you
with a rod and line.”
“Bora”: “Aragun” (B. 2/G/'2l) asks
“What bullocks make the lest workers?” All oxen-
conductors I know reckon steers They’re
light and therefore seldom get sore feet; still they
grow big and strong enougn. As lor ueing haruy,
well, they run an Army .look, a good second. Last
drought here our Jersey herd never had any feed or
scrub, and although some of them were knocking
«it the knees none of them died. Now we’re killing
them for station beef.

“Riom”: I advise “Chota” (B. 16/6/'2l)

HIGH FINANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Young Simeon Lazarus worked within
The firm of Yidds and Co. ;
And Simeon, being short of tin,
Had entered into ways of sin
To make the she-liorse go.
He nipped a tenner from the cash,
And out to Rar.dwick sped,;
It wasn’t, somehow, Simeon’s day,
For winners didn’t come Ids way—
Each prad he backed seemed dead.
Now Simeon every Monday morn,
Within the house of Yidds,
Took cash and book to the Old Man
Who on a long-established plan
Confirmed the count of quids.
Poor Simeon sat in worry wrapped
Within the Old Man’s room,
The Old Man’s coming to await
The hour was big with wrath and fate;
The air was filled with gloom.
In bustled Yidds; his overcoat,
A wondrous swell affair.
He hung on its accustomed hook,
And glanced at Sim and cash and book,
But did not take Iris chair.
“I want to talk to Abe,” said he,
"Re Israel and Black.
That firm, I think, is going sour.
No, don’t get up; in half an hour
Or less 1 will be back.”
The Old Man sought the room next door,
His junior partner’s lair,
And somehow in Jhat moment grim,
A wondrous brain-wave came to Sim,
Who bounded from his chair.
He took the Old Man’s overcoat,
He donned the Old Man’s hat,
And sped like lightning up the street
To where within a Monty l’eet,
A friendly Hebrew sat.
UNDER A CABBAGE.
“How much salt did it take to catch me,
dad?”
Upon the coat he raised four pounds ;
Like petrel on the wing,
He flew to a time-payment firm,
Paid four pounds down, arranged a term,
And bought a diamond ring.
Then straightway to the Monty Peet
Young Sim the diamond took,
Raised fourteen pounds upon it, and
Redeemed the coat in manner grand,
And blithely took his hook.
Back to the sanctum of old Yidds,
With coat and tenner he
In less time than it takes to tell
Arrived, and like a wedding-bell
All things went merrilee.
He put the coat upon its peg,
Likewise he put the hat;
He put the tenner in the cash,
Then, breathless from his erstwhile dash,
Down in his chair he sat.
And scarcely had he sat him down
When entered old-man Yidds.
He took the weekly tally then ;
With jovial grunt and scratch of pen,
He verified the quids.
In three months the time-payment debt,
Young Sim had paid, 1 know,
Redeemed the ring, which still he wears....
He sits now in luxurious chairs,
As head of Yidds and Cos.

“Raggedie Won”: In this motor-age the
traveller on the humble hike, push variety, is a
curiosity. At the shed from which I write we
have but one who travels per the flash method of
walking. We others make the journeys to and
fro by car. Three of the shearer-men run their own
ear and make a good hit on the side transporting
others. Why, we have a rouseabont here with a
’bus. Certainly it is old, nevertheless it is a car
within the meaning of the Act. 1 also know a gen-
eral station-hand who travels by Ford. Mentioning
the matter at the fire the other night I was given
to understand that everyone should have a car to
get around with.

“Pompey Tallywalka”: How's this for it

1 stooped to pick up a big one, when something
suddenly struck my cap anil pulled it oil. On look-
ing round I found a sft. black snake with the cap
still between his teeth.

bloodthirsty warning on a corner-post:—

“Bomho”: In most country towns you are
lucky if there is anything to tell you the name of
the street. But at Kiama (N.S.W. j, where most of
Sydney’s road-metal is quarried,’ they are not stingy
with information. At a comer of Manning-street,
lor instance, there's a stone to tell you that the
street hears S. 27 degrees W. It's a great, scheme

“En Zed”: “Te Pana’s” par (B. 2/G/’2l)
re Hindoos in Maoriland is mostly correct; but I
cannot let pass the slur he easts on the Maori
woman. She is on as high a moral plane as any
European, and 1 warn any t hunder Loo who, having
read “Te Pana's” par, may hasten to M.L. with"ideas
in his head of possessing a wahine, that he will come
a thud, A Maori woman knows she would commit
social suicide by receiving attention from Chinnier
and his friends. I don’t know of one who is living
with a Hindoo or Chinaman. Can the same be said
for our own race ?

“Billy T.”: Btithwell’s homestead stood
on a comfortable green hill surrounded by a desert
of dead gums clawing desperately at high Heaven.
Here drifted innumerable sheep. Down on the flat,
visible from the homestead, was a shallow lagoon
covering six or seven acres in the wet season, when
there was a wet season, but drying up with astonish-
ing rapidity under a warm sun. One day “Ears”
Wilson was found dead in the middle of the lagoon
in circumstances calling for an inquest. The jury
consisted largely of men from Brithwell's station,
and the unanimous verdict was “Drowned while in
a state of unsound mind.” “But,” the Coroner
TAKING NO RISKS.
NELL: “Jack seems perfectly devoted to you.
Why don't you marry him?”
JOAN: "Oh, I like to hare him devoted to
me.”
demanded, “how could the man be drowned?” “He
was drowned in the lagoon, of course,” replied the
foreman. “But half-a-dozen witnesses have testified
that there was no water in the lagoon.” “Yes, that's
all right,” proceeded the juryman. “We know that
and you know that, but ‘Ears’ had bin drunk a
month —how was he to know it ?”
A KATHLEEN MA NOU RNEEN.
PARSON: "So you amt Mary lire happily toy ether, Hilly?”
ABO.: "Only one row all our married life, boss.”
PARSON: “ flow beautiful !”
ABO.: “Yes, but that plurry row never finish, mine tinkit."
“Bonragi”: Recently I stated that, in the
days when Papua was British New Guinea, I found
dynamite more effective for killing fish than gelig-
nite. As a result, .1 have been abused by a lot of
good people who have travelled so far from the
original point as to embark on long dissertations on
the chemical composition of the various explosives.
“Recoil” and others who write as if they had some
practical experience of dynamite and gelignite, agree
with my remarks as to dynamite’s
superiority over gelignite as a fish-
killer. Others are like “Sudah
.latoh,” who curses the writer for
giving infusorial “clay,” instead of
infusorial “earth,” as the base of
dynamite. As Webster defines clay
as “an nuetuous, tenacious, plastic
earth,” “S.J.’s” point becomes mud
also. “Cleveland” has dug nothing
new out of his authorities, while
“Bukawaqa” proves my original point
to the hilt by admitting that dyna-
mite’s “wave of detonation” is more
rapid than gelignite’s. “Buk” also
says that “old miners, when they
don’t call an explosive fracteur, cull
it dynamite, and reckons that’s how
I acquired my ignorance. I hat e
lived among N.Q. miners; 1 have
been a gold warden in Papua; and
in later years I have been instructed
in the use of gun-cotton and ammonal
for cutting rails and destroying
bridges, and have put the lessons
into practice. And in all that time
1 never heard a miner use the word
“fracteur.” Lastly, “Buk” says (B.
2/6/'2i) that dynamite, as it was
before the war, has “disappeared from
the world’s markets” ; that “all dyna-
mite plants were dismantled and have
not been re-erected.” Further, he
reckons that the so-called dynamite
now available in Australia (at first
he denied there was any at all) is made
up of “sawdust, sodium nitrate and a had
smell.” Nevertheless, the Nobel-Glasgow people still
advertise that they are making, and selling in Aus-
tralia, “gelignite, blasting gelatine and dynamite.”
“Zanthus”: Bakers say that the older the
flour the better the bread. If that also applies
to wheat some N. S. Wales citizens had some super-
fine bread a while ago. Ages back, when wheat
was dirt-cheap, an old farmer on the South Coast
put part-of his crop into a silo. He died, and his
son, who came back and took over the farm, knew
nothing about the plant. Years—some say 30 years
after the wheat had been stowed away the son
got to hear the story, whereupon he dug the stuff
up and put it into consumption.
P. 11. Sit tor, official dairy expert for S.
Alls., says ditto to Governor Weigall, who has spoken
strongly about the low average milk-yield of the
State (320ga1.), anil urged dairymen to aim at
nearly double:—<
The class of dairy sire generally met with on
the farm is a disgrace. There are milked a lot
of unprofitable nondescripts which contain possibly
the blood of four or live breeds under the one hide.
....The cow is often considered merely as a grazing
animal. The milk supply is largely produced from
places with a rainfall from 12in. to 22iri. Fully
45,000 out of 103,000 milked are not paying for
their keep. True dairy cows, to be profitable, must
be fi-d on a ration containing a large supply of
digestible food nutriments. The Department recom-
mends that in place of bran the cows should be
given oats. Farmers are advised to feed well, test
their herds, and weed out the unprofitable cows.

“Te Pana”: Hori believes that the Maori
albino is due to the freak’s male parent being a fairy
or patu paiarehe. Some of the mountains were said
to be inhabited by fairy tribes and there were
romantic tales told in whares o’ nights of Maori
maids being pursued by amorous gnomes. Some-
times the lady won clear by fleetness of bare brown
limb. Sometimes she was caught—hence the albino.
Conan Doyle .never left the railway-track in Maori-
land, so there are no photographs to back up my
record.
“Searchlight”: Respite “Merlin” (B.
16/G/’2l), the cat-rabbit is a fact. J saw one on
a N.S.W. western run years ago, and have met others
who have seen the cross. As to “Merlin’s” assertion
that one is herbivorous and the other carnivorous,
doubtless a rabbit can become a carnivorous animal
the same as a eat can become herbivorous. Within
a hundred yards front where I write is a cat that
lives entirely on vegetables and will turn down meat
in any shape, either raw or cooked.
“Dudlyngil”: The criticisms of “Cleve-
land” and “Bukawaqa” (B. 2/6/’2l) or my par are
quite irrelevant. “Bouragi's” original statement
was that “the slow, rending action of gelignite is
less effective than dynamite” (for killing fish). I
gave reasons why this was so, which have not been
contradicted. “Bukawaqa” lias mis-fired in compil-
ing the component parts of gelignite, as now made.
If this explosive contains potassium nitrate, as he
says, I am prepared to let him attach a detonated
fuse to a stick of it and blow my knowledge of high
explosives into obscurity. If potassium is treated
with nitric acid it will most certainly neutralise all
the sensitive explosive qualities in the two com-
pounds. I repeat that gelignite is composed only
of nitro-glycerine, nitre, gun-cotton and wood-meal.
As for “Cleveland” asserting that nitro-glycerine was
once used in its raw state for blasting purposes, all
I can say is that he is reckless in handling more
things than explosives. Here is the brief history of
nitro-glycerine. Crude glycerine was at one time
considered a waste-product, 'mt scientists discovered
its high-explosive character when treated with nitric
acid; hence the compound nitro-glvcerine. Jt is
yellow, sweet to the taste, extremely poisonous and
is of such a delicate nature that it is too dangerous
to handle or move to any extent in its undiluted
state. A sudden rise in temperature has been known
to explode it. How, then, could it be used in
100 p.c. forms for blasting, as “Cleveland” declares'/
By the way, he has innocently opened up a ques-
tion of detonation that will take some answering.
His own explanation will not pass muster, as he
does not say how detonation causes the overthrowing
of the delicately-balanced forces he refers to. Con-
cussion is obviously not detonation. One of the
greatest of authorities on explosives once told me he
could only define it as the making of two volumes
of combustion harmonise. For example, if (sayi
til) E note on a piano is struck it may cause an
H string of a violin or a glass-vase in the room
to produce the same note. Similarly, a detonator
must he of it certain exploding force, no more and
no less.

years ago he could have seen a cross between a

corellas, had the grey wings' of a galah, but was

“Zanthus”: There’s :t dodge in use along
the Cordeaux River at the hack of the South Coast
(N.S.W.) which might be worth trying elsewhere.
Sixty years or so ago many landholders, at the
suggestion of a citizen who had seen the thing
tried in India, planted buffalo-grass along the edges
of the river. It has held the banks together wonder-
fully and prevented the erosion by floods, while as
fodder it heats blackberries hollow.
“Had Australian”: I have soon hundreds
of condors, and although I have never struck a
specimen measuring more than lift, across the
wings, f am willing to accept “Pilcaneu's” lift,

man was unable to lift the bird on to his horse 1
protest. The heaviest condor 1 ever met weighed
just 311 b. and taped 10ft. Bin. from wing tip to
wing tip. About 10 or 12 years ago condors were
fairly numerous, especially around the passes where
cattle and mules were trooped across the Andes
front Argentina to Central and Northern Chile, but
nowadays, owing to the unrelenting war waged
against them, they are in a fair way to follow the
dodo and the great auk. When a live condor is
wanted the hunter kills a worn-out mule or burro
and builds a palisade of stout sticks about Gft. or
7ft. high around the carcase. Then the condor calls
in for lunch and gorges to such art extent that he
is unable to rise out of the trap.
“Faceplate”: “Murka'h" is right enough
up to a point (B. 2/G/’2l) in his par on the harden-
ing ot steel, hut when lie writes that “water-cooling
is not necessary ; in fact, there are several brands of
tool-steel on the market that may be quenched by
cold-air stream only;’ he is oil the anvil. The steel
referred to as air-hardening is not the common car-
bon steel as used in axes, knives, razors, saws (other
than metal saws), chisels, etc., but what is known to
engineers as “high-speed.” The active hardening
principle in H.S. steel is not exactly carbon, chemi-
cally combined with the iron ; H.S. is a complex alloy
of tungsten (or molybdenum), chromium and vana-
dium, with a smaller quantity of carbon (7 p.c.),
and iron. The tungsten quantity varies with different
brands—and frequently with the same brand and in
the same bar—and hardens either in dry-air blast
or oil. Carbon steel will not effectively harden with-

between H.S. steel and carbon steel as there is
between Mr. Greene and Mr. Gregory, and the two
should never be confused. While mentioning Gregorv,
are any axes yet made in Australia? If not, why not?
Australian steel is quite good enough.

Fact!
that it implies a vast bureaucracy—for ex-
ample, the machinery of co-operation fore-
shadowed by Professor Duncan Hall comprises
four main organisations and subsidiary
conferences and bureaus. There are some
things that do not bear thinking about, and
one of them is the length of time the empire
would survive which once a year or oftener
brought into conflict on the grand scale on
the one hand supercilious temperaments
such as are possessed by a common type of
stay-at-home Englishman, and on the other
self-sufficient or arrogant personalities like
W. M. Hughes, Joseph Cook and many more
successful politicians whose names will
readily occur. Professor Hall’s brilliant
book is bound to interest every student of
the subject; but it is not likely to convince
many Australians, who have observed the
rarity of tact amongst Party politicians anti
the embittering effects of its absence, that
there is a better way to hold the delicate fab-
tic of Empire together than to leave it alone.

The Vowel Men
The tendency to trace everything of worth
to Asia was very marked a few years ago ;
hut now that a good deal of the rust has been
rubbed oil' the key of language we have a
chance of carrying investigation to surer
results. Thus the European race was long
supposed to have come from Asia because
Sanskrit is the oldest written European
tongue; and it was argued that the race
must have had its beginnings near the place
where that language was found. Now the
whole view is changed. Grammatical con-
struction is the test of the antiquity of a
language. Sanskrit was written thousands
of years ago, hut that shows nothing. On
grammatical construction there arc Euro-
pean languages in Europe far older, though
they have only a century or two of litera-
ture behind them. Lithuanian is probably
the nearest to the primitive tongue; and
therefore the cradle of the race is not very
far from the place where Lithuanian main-
tained itself through all the years.
Hut. there is revelation of racial character
in language which hitherto every scholar
has missed. Where east and west faced one
another across the battlegrounds of Asia
Minor and Jupheth looked contemptuously
cit, the tents of Shorn, there was a meeting
place not only of two groups of languages
out ot two systems of language. The way
a man speaks shows as much of his charac-
ter as the thing he says,; and the wav a
group of nations first learned to express
then thoughts should be an index of their
earnestness of purpose and place in the
of T , ®an. This being so, the fact
tnat the European word-roots are based on
the vowels- and those of the first Asiatic
nations with which Europeans came in con-
tact based on consonants has a deep signi-
ficance. The consonant is formed with “the
lips, tongue and teeth; the vowels are made
b.v deep full breath The people, therefore,
who find the radical part of their words in
the consonants are manifestly those who
take a shallower view of life and the things
about them. Words are the very essence
of humanity and the deeper and' stronger
the main arnL essential part of the word
®r d stl ' onger must be the con-
tinmty °t feeling about the things expressed.
All words are constantly in a state of
, , ropean.s created their variety of
speech by tl.e change of consonants, which
did not seem to matter ; but the full back-
bone of the word, the vowel that gave it
character, did not change. With the Semi-
mnfFn e ,P P e mi l<: t F e v °wels that did not
mattei. The Egyptians—not Semites, but
Wlth the same lingual habits—
lett out the vowels m their writing. You
could guess whether it was an A or an I
that was intended; but whichever it was it
Fi re F to the People who depended
tor their chief expression of their lives on
teeth and lips and tongue. It might be pos-
fw 6 J? S<> . e L cn fa j' thei ' than this and show
that the chatter of the anthropoid ape and
the arboreal man must have been almost
entirely consonantal; only the croon of love
and the cry of rage or pain would have anv-
thing like vowel value. This would seem to
indicate that a new view must be taken of
the history behind history; for if by the
r \‘Ty, uMure of their speech the ancient
peoples of Asia can be shown to be nearer to
an animal ancestry than the European
their claim to the possession of the earlier
civilisation begins to weaken.
All attempts to reconstruct the primitive
European tone-lie from words common to its
modern branches go to prove that the first
users of the language were very far from being
sin ages. It may have been spoken in a
htone Age, but a Stone Age very different
trom that, say, of the Australian aborigines.
A civilisation could get some distance with-
out metals; and life may have been fairly
well ordered and comfortable before the use
of hardened bronze. In guessing back and
helping out our guess from the words which
remain, we can partly reconstruct the early
European life —a life earlier far than the
I yramids and already in flower before the
first foundations of Babylon were laid.
Somewhere in a region where winter was
severe and summer sweet and short, far from
the sea and out of touch with the lines of
primitive commerce, there lived a nation of
virile hardy folk who had tamed all the
domestic animals, who ploughed the fields
and sowed all the more valuable grains, who
made vessels of earthenware and wove
material for their garments on the loom.
Their houses were probably of clay cased
with finely woven basketwork of willow.
They were people of picturesque speech who.
loved oratory and poetry; for the real poetic
impulse came from them. At a very remote
period this nation must have had a high
political organisation. Without that its
spread would have been impossible. While
the people of the Nile valley were slowly
getting some idea of sowing seed on their
mud the northern nation had spread east
and west. At the first blink of genuine his-
tory it extended in fragments from the Urals
to the Bay of Biscay; but language furnishes
evidence of its conquest of India and Persia.
\ ast numbers of people in those countries
speak a European language, though they
show no trace of European blood. The
Indian of the highest caste undoubtedly
holds his rank to-day because of a very
slender thread connecting him with the Euro-
pean overlord of long ago; and the culture
language of the big peninsula is European.
The existence of such a tongue proves not
only that the conquest lasted long enough to
leave permanent traces, but that it was a
conquest by a people far advanced in civilisa-
tion.
So, on the proof of language, the “European
barbarian” theory goes to pieces; and it is no
longer necessary to look to the Nile and
Euphrates valleys for the beginnings of
human culture. It was the big vowel man
who led the way in the essentials. He did
not build pyramids; he was long in getting
letters ; but for thousands of years lie had
nne things of his own which made life worth
living. There is an old racecourse belong-
ing to the Stone Age near Stonehenge •
how many more were there scattered over
tlio thousands of miles of his ancient terri-
tory—racecourses, without one bookmaker,
on which 12-stone jockey-owners rode to
w ' n - . r Fhe Olympic games and the other
athletic carnivals of European Greece were
probably but dwindling echoes of the great
sports of northern ancestors. And all the
winter earlier Homers sang by the great
lires, with laughter and good jesting between
the songs. It takes a vowel language to tell
a jest that is worth while. Asia had very
little laughter among its consonants; anil
the civilisation of to-day has found among
its economics and commercial enterprises very
little that can make life better worth while
than it was to the European of the ages that
missed history for lack of an alphabet.

Style and the Typewriter
, ® e Jween 40 and 50 contributors want to
tell Adrian Lawlor what they think of his
article (R.l\ 0/0/21) on “Style and the
typewriter.” They can’t all do it in print;
but these remarks seem to cover the ground :
Shelley, complaining that inspiration was fading
before pen or pencil could be grasped, might, in a
prophetic moment, have bewailed the delay in the
coining of a wonderful little machine, such as 1
am using now, scarcely more than pocket size,
which would have registered his thought with the
minimum of delay and (he maximum of clearness.
On the other hand the Egyptian Lawlor, using his
fluinsy reed pen to transcribe a conception upon
papyrus, would, no doubt, grieve over the coining
of the goose-quill, and I suppose the Lawlor of
Herculaneum, when the metal pen put in a first
appearance, etched laborious tablets contending that
noble thoughts are inconceivable apart from the
reed or the stylus. Later the ordinary steel-pen
was driven out by the fountain-pen, but not until
the imperishable conservative mind had discovered
that the fountain-pen was destructive to the bland,
leisurely, contemplative method, involving a dip
<it every third word. Lime was when 1 imagined
it to be utterly impossible to express myself
adequately on the typewriter, but to-day, paddling
the keys, I feel I have much in common with a
Paderewski, and have discovered the one congenial
instrument without which I would be as a man
reft of a limb. When the making of necessary
repairs deprives me of the typewriter for a day,
and I am driven back to the pen, I find the nib
cold, hard, silent, inept, utterly antagonistic, and 1
return to the fluent, friendly flow of the machine
with an easy mind and a thankful heart. The man
who speaks of “the disjointed prodding progress
of the typewriter” has not allowed himself to be-
come familiar with his keyboard, or, lacking manual
dexteiity, is ascribing his natural deficiencies to
the discredit of the most satisfactory medium be-
tween the creator and his paper.—E.D.
Adrian Lawlor admits that the machine has
levelled up the standard of everyday journalism,
and are they not an ever-decreasing number who,
writing for a more permanent audience, do not wait
for typewritten copies of their creations before
adding the final corrective and polishing touches?
It is on record that Walter Pater was never sure of'
his results until he saw his writing in print, and
the amount of purely stylistic work he put into
successive proofs was a considerable worry to his
publishers. Can the modern eye, which seldom reads
liteiatuic of any kind otherwise than as a printed
document, convey to the brain the means of form-
ing a just literary valuation of manuscript? For
my own part I confess not only that the mere
distance between period and period in manuscript
throws me out of mental breath, but that indifferent
printing seriously warps my judgment. In anv
case Mr. Lawlor has under-rated the possibilities of
cajolement luiking in the keyboard of the machine.
And when it is developed as the modern grand
pianoforte has been developed from the 17th-cen-
tury spinet, what force of passion, what delicacy
of fancy, what depths of emotion may it not draw
from the sensitive fingertips of some twenty-first
century master? Already from the rattletrap of
15 years ago has come the most hauntingly
beautiful and musical 20th-century prose. Says John
Masefield, who probably knew more than any other
contemporary of Synge’s methods of composition:—
When I firc-t called upon him I found him at his
typewriter, hard at work. He was making a fair
copy oi one of his two early one-act plays, then
just finished. His typewriter was a small portable
machine of the Blick variety. He was the only
writer I have ever known [Masefield was writing
about 1910] who composed direct upon a tvpe“
writing machine. I have often seen him at work
upon it. He worked rather slowlv and verv care-
fully, sitting very upright. He composed slowlv
He wrote and re-wrote his nlays many times *1
remember that, on this first occasion, the table had
a pile of typewritten drafts upon it.
Synge s prose is as deeply personal as anything in
the range of all literatures, a direct emanation from
a soul at once resolute, gentle, proud, passionate
and sensitive —tne adjectives are cribbed from that
rare old friend of his, W. B. Yeats—and redolent of
the color, charm and human individuality which
A.L. suggest ,- must be lost in the work oi a man who
thinks straight on to the machin c\ —-O’H Aoxiax.
What writer, imagination-thrilled, is ever conscious
of his pen ? Ii ever he be, it is to sigh for a faster
one. In a typewriter he has got it. Like every-
thing else under the hand of man, a typewriter
must have justice done to it. Then it is far from
being “cold, still and sullen.” Dull thing of
iron, indeed! With, if used as the manufacturers
intended, ten leaping fingers to thrum its soul
awake! Although I sit every day amongst touch-
typists, men and women who can type flawlessly at
speed and can converse gjid laugh with one without
needing to let their eyes drop to the keys, I have
yet to cease being fascinated by their inevitable
sang-froid. 1 hey are oblivious to the presence of
any mechanism, well-oiled or not; for each drilled
finger goes to its own particular letter as effort-
lessly and unconsciously as one breathes. If these
typists wrote prose or verse, would they be “filter-
ing their personality through a machine*’ were they
to think straight upon it? The phrase sounds well,
I know, but it hardly' bears cross-examination. To
write is meiely (or wonderfully', to be more correct)
to describe on paper one’s mind-scenes and situations
as faithfully as one’s gift of words allows. What
can better attempt to keep pace with the mental
cinema than a typewriter? And if a “graphic pen”
why not a graphic typewriter? Yes, why not?
Moreover the boon of it. What an inestimable bless-
ing one would have been to Victor Hugo! And to
Eugene Sue when pouring his countless words into,
for instance, “The Wandering Jew” ! And, after all,
why not Coleridge as a convert, too, had typewriters
been in vogue then? — R. L. Clay.
A Satchel of Books
One Man’s Initiation, by John Dos Passos (Allen
and Unwin). Before the Americans took the field in
the bite war there were many American Bed Cross
men in Prance. This is a clear and racy narrative
of things seen and felt b.v one of them. A very-
frank and vivid series of pictures from life.
In Memoriam Sumner Locke (Sydney J. Endacott
Melbourne). A little volume of reprinted verses,
with appreciations of their authoress by Randolph
Bedford, E. J. Brady, Steele Rudd. Boyd Cable, Mary
Giant Bruce and Vance Palmer. There are good por-
traits of Sumner Locke and the little son she left
behind.
Reminiscences of Queensland, 18(12-189!), by W. 11.
Corfield (A. 11. Prater, Brisbane). A simple and
straightforward personal account of all sorts of
matters relating to settlement and politics by a man
who took some public part in Queensland affairs.
It will interest old settlers more than the general
reader.
Ilodger and the Boarders, by Ernest O’Perrall
(N.S.W. Bookstall series). This book, mostly of
Bulletin reprints, opens with the talc of the cheer-
ful drunk who brought an escaped lioness home to
the boarding-house under the impression that it was
a big dog. All through there is bubbling mirth and
ouaintness of observation which give the pages
charm.
Twisted Trails, by Henry Oyen (Hodder and
Stoughton). American fiction of a sort—the sort a
.junior clerk might write after a prolonged diet of
Hex Beach, Zane Grey and Sewell Cord. Unreal
characters, false atmosphere, absurd climax. With
“a peal of demoniac laughter” the author’s bad man
“wildlv waves his hands at the sky” and blows
himself up in his own motor-boat. It is just what
such an unutterable ass would do. But no doubt
the moving-picture rights will be worth something.
Victorian Municipal Directory (Arnall and Jackson,
Melbourne). This handy volume is ;3(> years old and
has grown to 760 pages. Besides including the usual
municipal statistics, the information now covers a
lot of State and Commonwealth activities. The War
Service Homes Commission, the Navigation Service
and the Trade Commission in China are some of the
Federal matters referred to, whilst under the State
heading the subjects range from the list of decora-
tions worn by the Governor to the duration of
twilight in Melbourne.
The Red and White Diamond (McCubbin, Mel-
bourne). The history of the 24th Battalion, A.I.F.,
by Sergeant W. J. Harvey, M.M., with a foreword by
General Birdwood, gaves a modest account of the
Battalion’s achievements at Lone Pine (Gallipoli)
and Pozieres, Bullecourt, Passchendaele, and other
momentous places. There is a good description of
the capture of Mont St. Quentin, in which the 24th
performed wonders by cleverly organised attacks by
handfuls of men. Even the author, an eye-witness,
can’t tel] exactly how the amazing thing was done.
The Faithful Fool, by G. B. Burgin (Books, Ltd.).
Burgin, having written Co novels and more short
stories than he can count, knows his business and
keeps the reader guessing to the end. His chief
characters take some swallowing, but because lie
knows his job he doesn’t have to beg of you to
oblige him by believing that this or that happened.
If you start “The Faithful Fool’’ you will certainly
want to know how he gets out of the tangle, anil
will agree that no other conclusion would be quite
true to the strange characters he has drawn.
She and Allan , by II. Rider Haggard (Hutchin-
son;. Herein the weary author introduces Allan
Quatermain to the old fabulous Ayesha, who be-
witched the beauteous Leo Vincey in the original
tale of “She.” Apparently the purpose of the yarn
is to provide a different diagnosis of the lady’s char-
acter, and Haggard includes an alleged “Note” from
Allan, in case any incredulous reader should doubt
the authenticity of the narrative. But little is ottered
besides the exploits of Umslopogaas and the curiously
embellished intellect of the withered Hottentot Hans
to compensate for She’s resurrection.
The Purple Heights , by Marie Conway Oemler
(Heinemann). A story which begins brilliantly, but
whose early promise is not sustained. Having created
an attractive hero and sketched his life in an old
South Carolina settlement with rare vividness and
feeling, the authoress violently transports him to
English country-houses and tiie Latin quarter of
Palis. In that environment (it is obviously painted
at second hand)*he becomes hopelessly artificial, not
to say maudlin, and the mischief is completed by
involving him in an impossible love affair. Still,
the book is worth reading for the first nine or 10
chapters—in particular for an account of a nigger-
hunt that eats into the memory like acid.
the Outer Circle, by Thomas Burke (Allen and
Unwin). London’s outlying suburbs spring up in a
month, and are grey with age in a year. This
author has gone forth on tours of adventure to
these new-old places. He writes with a happy care-
lessness and delightful sympathy for men and things,
gathers here a bunch of history, there a sprig of
romance, drinks in remote pubs, speculates on the
success of chrysanthemum-growing in crowded back
yards, mocks the futile attempts of religious societies
to bring reform to those whose wav of life is happier
than that of their would-be instructors, and does
all in the friendly familiar fashion of one who knows
his reader must be as decent a fellow as himself.
A very good book of an attractive kind.
The Man Who Did the Right Thing , by Harry
Johnston (Chatto and Windus). Having in his
many-colored life been painter, scientist, African
explorer, diplomat, colonial governor, economist and
publicist, this indefatigable sexagenarian (he is 63)
has taken to writing novels. Uncommonly good
novels they are, too. The work under notice is a
brilliant study of late Victorian and Edwardian
Britain. East Africa is also painted with a glowing
brush. There are interesting glimpses behind the
scenes at the Foreign Office, striking observations on
the negro problem, keen vignettes of Chamberlain
and other personages, racy descriptions of “Society”
and the politics of the period. And with all this
is a story told with unusual skill and charm, and
with much shrewd delineation of character. The
result is a book of rare distinction—indeed, consider-
ing that it is the production of a man who, though
elderly, is a mere novice at the craft, it is a rather
astonishing achievement. Incidentally, some of the
people in the novel —and two of the most lovable-
are Australians.

“Ruby Queen”: Coals to Newcastle?
Why, I know a case of coal being taken
regularly to a coal-mine. It is the Balmain
(N.S.W.) colliery, which has been closed
down for some time, and coal goes there to
keep the pumping-engines going.

“Edom”: Aarons had had a beautiful fire,
a perfect fire. Curtains, hung ostensibly to
keep dust from the shelves, had served to
carry the flames right round the warehouse.
Into the blackened shop stepped Umpstein
full of condolences. “A bad job, Aarons,
mein friend,” he said—“a bad job.” “Bad
job!” ejaculated Aarons. “See here, how
vould you improve on it?”
* * * *
“Sol-fa”: A building now going up at
Port Kembia (N.S.W.) may put a million
or two bushels on to the wheat crop ot
N. S. Wales before long. It is intended that
it shall turn out 30,000 tons of superphos-
phates a year. The phosphate rock is to
come from Nauru, and a consignment of sul-
phur has already come to hand from U.S.A.
Why Australia, with several smelters send-
ing thousands of tons of sulphur up the
spout every year, can’t produce its own
sulphur is another matter.
“Nitric”: A year after Villers Bret. I
started a banana-farm on the fertile black
scrub soil of the S. Queensland coast. I
ran up against everything from the rise in
price of fertiliser to the marsupial and ter-
matode combination. My first year I made
more out of suckers than fruit, but last year
Allah was good, and I shipped 800 bunches
to the southern markets. The fruit was
placed next to the boilers on the boat. Half
the load went to the pack. Then a bill
came in for £lO for “destruction of fruit
condemned.” “Nothing's too good for the
Digger.” My oath!
* * * *
“Hopo”: That Australia has imported so
much hopes this year £B. 16/0/'2l) is
chiefly due to the pool formed last year.
Practically none came into Australia during
the war. In 1914 the Tasmanian pick sold
at Bd. lb. f.o.b. Hobart, compared with Cali-
fornians at Is. 9d. lb. d.p. Certainly the
Speck hops gave an extract of only 12
p.c., and Californians 16 p.c.; but as the
Tassies had a superior flavor and were Aus-
tralian most users preferred the home article.
Towards the end of the war the Tas. hops
were pushed up until at the beginning of the
vear they notched the record price of from
Bs. 6d. to 10s. per lb. Hobart. There was
no shortage to account for this: you could
buy any amount at that price. Further, the
pool issued a circular letter and contract
note to users asking them to state their re-
quirements for the coming season, leaving
the price open. No business man would con-
tract under these conditions; and buyers
turned elsewhere. The pool price was pre-
sently fixed at 4s. 9d. Hobart; but mean-
time Californian and Bohemian were to- be
had for 3s. 9d. and 3s 6d. d.n. respectively.
Naturally, consumers, sore at their treat-
ment by the pool, are using the cheaper
though foreign articl , and thus the growers
themselves have helped to settle another in-
dustry.
WHEN THE WHALING SHIPS CAME IN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Old Time rolled back the years last night,
And showed me once again
The crude, quaint 1 ito of a seaport town
And a swarm of sailor men.
That town has grown to a city great
And the pailormen have gone;
But somewhere, moulding our life and moods,
The life of the past lives on.
Rough men and tall, with their throats and brow#
By sun and sea made brown,
Came whaling men from the Tasman Sea
To revel in Sydney Town.
They met with many a song to sing,
And many yarns to .spin,
In the quarters back of Cumberland-street,
When the whaling ships came in.
New-come from sea through the narrow streets
’Twas sweet to roam and rove,
What time their ships on the harbor-tides
Lay anchored in Sydney Cove.
And one he courted a Currency lass.
Brown-eyed, brown-armed and gay ;
And one he jigged to a laughing crowd,
With body and head asway.
With song and dance in the Brown Bear Inn,
They passed the glowing hours,
And one gave gold for a wanton’s kiss,
And one gave a gift of flowers.
Red rum they drank till their eyes grew red,
And peace gave way to strife;
Red rum they lifted with spilling hands
And drank to a whaler’s life.
But all the while in the streets outside
The drowsy sunlight shone,
The hucksters called, and the soldiers marched,
And the quaint old life went on.
There shame went by with a guilty gait,
And care with brooding brow,
And gqssips gossiped on world events
That never are mentioned now.
The times have changed and the town has changed,
New modes, new styles we don,
And down to the grave, to rise no more,
Those roysterous days have gone.
All gone the rollicking sailormen.
All gone their dance and din,
That woke the quiet of Cumberland-street,
When the whaling ships came in.

Think of the inconvenience

going outside in all kinds
of weather, as compared to
the big saving in time and,
the convenience of having
running water at the
kitchen sink.
What DELCO-LIGHT
means to the Farmer.
ARMERS are learning that
Delco-Light is a money-
saver that they cannot
afford to be without.
Delco - Light not only
brings them the convenience of
electric light and power, but
supplies them at an unusually
low cost. They have watched
Delco-Light pay for itself among
their neighbors, and seen the
generous savings that it makes for
them—savings that total high at
the end of the year! In actual
figures Delco-Light costs relatively
only one-fourth as much for fuel
as the old oil-lamp, and how
immeasurably safer it is! This
economy, combined with the relia-
bility, safety and simplicity, are
features of the plant in operation.
They also explain the daily use of
150,000 Delco-Light plants
throughout the world. Delco-
Light may be seen in operation at

Reported that one of the most strenuous
of the Sydney unemployed—a leader among
them—recently had work forced upon him
by the State. He didn’t go to it, but sent
an impostor in his stead, and diddled the
luckless impostor out of Gs. for the use of
his name. Yet there is supposed to be a
Vagrancy law lying about somewhere.
From the Federal Gallery :
The lagging discussion on the Tariff has so shaken
the Hughes Government’s optimism regarding an
early finish that an extra sitting day has been
ordered, and there is talk of all-night sittings to
get the schedule ready for the Senate and pass Hills
against exploitation and dumping by the end of
July. It is a big contract, especially as the sug-
gested Hills will contain a lot of contentious matter,
but Cook and his colleagues are so eager for the
recess they promised themselves that some of them
would do almost anything to escape the eloquence
of the Gumleaf corner for two or three weeks.
“Sixenate”: A pair of Penrith (N.S.W.)
aldermen are ruminating over the unkind-
ness of Fate and the folly of issuing and
listening to hot-air challenges. One repre-
sented Central and the other East Ward,
and after a wordy scrap the latter offered
to resign and contest his seat with his
enemy. The challenge was accepted, and
things would have been all right for one of
them if an ambitious outsider hadn’t stepped
in. At the cqunt this unexpected person
tied with the original owner of the seat;
then they drew lots and he won. Meantime
the vacancy in the other ward was filled by
another newcomer; so now both challenger
and challenged are groping in the outer dark-
ness.
From the press table: —
With Maxwell as his counsel, Cyril Sidebottom,
a Bank or N. Z. clerk in Melbourne, got off clear
of the charge of having taken £2129 of the bank’s
money. Sidebottom’s defence was that he didn't
intend to steal it. Too late to lock it up in the
strong-room, he took it away with him and was
robbed of it at his home. It was admitted he
was at the races on the day he put the money in
his pocket. The report of the robbery caused a
sensation at the time, but now it seems that “the
mere temporary taking of something with no inten-
tion to deprive the owner of the property does not
amount to larceny.” Somehow it recalls that in
Molesworth’s palmy days at the Bar a foreman of
a jury came into court and told the Judge that it
had found “a verdict for Mr. Molesworth,” and then
explained that it meant Molesworth’s client.
A noisy minority put up a bitter fight on
the timber duties in the House of Reps.
Most of the opposition was inspired by hos-
tility to the timber ring, but an admiration
for Oregon obsessed Dicky Foster, the Pro-
tectionist member for Wakefield. Ten times
Foster spoke on the subject, and every time
he grew more explosive, until just before the
division it seemed certain that he would
burst. The real value of his eloquence was
shown by a majority of 20 for the Govern-
ment in a total vote of 42. But the heavy
defeat seemed only to stir him to further
passion. In the general babel of the adjourn-
ment he could be seen gnashing his whiskers
at Joe Cook, and the latter’s heightened
color suggested that Foster wasn’t present-
ing an illuminated address. .
There are thin-skinned men who for years
harbor resentment of even trifling affront.
But they are not politicians. While a mem-
ber of N.S.W. Assembly was in the witness-
box the other day the cross-examination went
this way:—
Do you know Blinks?—l cannot recall him.
If I say he grossly insulted you, does the observa-
tion refresh your memory?—No.
Can you recollect having been called, in the pre-
sence of others, a liar and a pimp?—No.
Will you swear that Blinks did not thus describe
you to your face before a dozen people?—l do not
recall ic.
And did he not say that, knowing you as the man
you are, he felt certain you would take the insult
sitting down ?—I do not remember that happening.
No evidence was called to show whether he
had ever forgotten to draw his “honorarium.”
A discursion on murder by poison:—
Manslaughter is defined as “the killing of any-
one unlawfully but without malice or forethought,”
so it is customary to exclude certain offences
from the benefit of the doubt and call them plain
murder. Poisoning, long-continued lying in wait
with a gun, killing by starvation and such things
a e not supposed to be done in hot blood. At
Sydney recently Vera Flannery, widow, aged IS,
was accused of having fatally strychnined her 23-
vear-old husband after informing certain friends
that she intended doing it and after trying her ’pren-
tice hand on two dogs, which was bad for the
dogs. It was also said that there was another man
in the case. If the evidence was wrong then the
girl was a child of misfortune and entitled to the
proposed widow’s pension. If it was right then
there was no sign that the crime was one of sud-
den frenzy, and it looked as like murder as the
case of Duncan and Macbeth. Yet a jury
which lacked the coinage to go the whole hog
either way found Vera guilty of manslaughter,
and the Judge made some smothered remarks, and
the girl widow left the dock to start the first lap
of her 12-years sentence. A more strenuous jury-
might have found her guilty of horrid murder
and recommended that she be released under the
l irrt Offenders’ Act. Then if she killed any mo.e
husbands she would come up for sentence. That
would at least be understandable, for plenty of
people who have committed one murder have lived
a perfectly respectable life ever afterwards. The
verdict of manslaughter is only understandable on
the assumption that juries have decided to abolish
murder so long as we make death the sentence for
the crime, leaving it largely to luck whether it
will be carried out or not.
A SUGGESTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Hughes thought the name British Empire
was unfortunate, implying a negation of the demo-
cratic principles on which the Dominions rested. He
preferred the designation British Commonwealth.”
Not “British Commonwealth,” a term absurd
Where many men grow rich on others’ losses;
Nor “British Empire,” for the latter word
Suggestive is of autocratic bosses ;
Nor “British Federation,” ’twould imply
One ruling power wherein all men delighted ;
Nor Union, which smacks of days gone by
When Ireland, as now, was disunited.
Give us the phrase—vast, comprehensive, terse,
And all-inspiring—“ British Universe” !
VICTORIA.

In spending large sums of money
in seeking the goodwill of the public
for any article, unless the quality is behind the goods
the money is wasted. It costs much more than the
profit on any article of common sale to induce the
first purchase. The profit comes when the person
is satisfied and continues a customer. This is the
secret of the success of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills. People once try and then continue to use
them regularly. From time to time other so-called
remedies are boomed and tried, but soon found to
be ineffective, and prompt return to Dr. Morse’s I ndian
Root Pills is made with gratifying results. For
many years this remedy has been in constant use
in Australasia. Families have grown up with scarcely
any other medicine in the house, and the present
generation looks back from childhood to having had
their mothers give Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills if
they showed indications of being out of sorts. To-
day the remedy stands higher than ever before in
the esteem of thousands as a good dependable article
of the highest quality, sold at a reasonable price
within the reach of all classes.

George W. Sims, who died the other day,
aged 79, was Vic.’s G.O.M. of bowls. Over lialf-u-
-century ago he played on the famous old ground at
Prahrun, and later with West Melbourne, St. Kilda
and Melbourne. Amongst a cartload of trophies, he
numbered the Vic. championship (five times), N.S.V .
open championship (1890) and Australian cham-
pionship (1902).

Dick Arnst has formally accepted D’Arcy
Hadtield’s challenge for the world’s sculling cham-
pionship and £5OO aside, and articles are being
drawn up. The race will take place on the Wan-
ganui. Iladfleld showed great form at last year’s
Olympic Games, and the 37-yeat'-old champion is
likely to find him a much stiffcr proposition than
Hannan was.

South Aus. “classic’’ race entries are fewer

Port Adelaide Guineas (100) and Fulham Park Plate

Despite the opposition of Ikey Mo. at
Tlandwtek, the tote put up record figures for the
past year. In 21 days £1,280,551 went througi:
the machine, an increase ot' £149,959 on 1919-20,
and of £575,445 in 1918-19. If the betting business
was as lucrative to 1 key Mo., what a time it was for
cigars and suppers! The A.J.O. got a percentage of
nearly £60,000 out. of the tote, and the rush of
money to the till helped the club to give away
£101,500 in added money for the season —an increase
of £21,100 on the previous year’s figures.
Football results among the Adelaide clubs
are more interesting than ever. When the eight
had met each other once all round there was not
one with less than two defeats, Norwood, Sturt and
Port being level at the top. An extraordinary match
between West Adelaide and North ended in a tie, the
former by a miracle of straight kicking scoring li
goals 4 behinds to the others’ 9 goals 16 behinds.

The astonishing West Adelaide football
squabble still continues, in spite of efforts at. recon-
ciliation. Edwards, though a member of both City
Council and Parliament, cannot get the Football
League to allow him inside its meetings as a delegate
of the club, and after much negotiation he last week
served a Supreme-Court writ on the League. As it
happens, that body has always had a lawyer as
chairman —Jim Anderson, K.C.; then Cleland, K.C. ;
now A. J. McLachlan.
The Australian Lawn Tennis Association’s
balance-sheet, shows what it cost to play last year’s
Davis Cup matches in M.L. Gross receipts were
£8642. The heaviest exes, were £639 for hire of
ground and £4803 for stands, etc. Of the profit
of £2335 the Assoc, got £1167, of which £6Bl
went in exes, of team and . £384 for entertainment in
M.L. and Australia. The Americans’ tour in Aus-
tralia later on cost £172. The Assoc, begins another
year with £4BBB in the Davis Cup account. £556 in
the general revenue account, and £244 in the
Anthony Wilding memorial account.
Landed home by the Sonoma last trip
Frank Beaurepaire and Ivan Stedman from Honolulu,
whither they had journeyed to participate in the
Hawaiian swimming championships. Stedman was
not successful in free-stvle events, but carried off
the 100yds. and 200yds. breaststroke events in lmin.
17sec. and 2min. 53sec. respectively, creating new
figures for the Islands. Beaurepaire went under
to Ludy Langer in the 440yds. and 880yds. races by
narrow margins, but had the satisfaction of breaking-
world’s records for 10-00 metres, 1500 metres and
one mile, his times being 14min. 28sec., 21min.
54 4-ssec., and 23min. 30 4-ssee. Much interest
was evinced by experts in “Bogey’s” famous trud-
geon stroke, and so impressed was “Dad” Center, Hono-
lulu swimming authority, who did so much for
Kahanamoku and others, that he has determined to
introduce it among the islanders.

When the National Coursing Association
staged its Champion Cup meeting at Rooty Hill
(N.S.W.) the other day it had only 30 good hares on
the ground. This for a day of 25 courses! Five
bit the dust, leaving but 25 to decide the 24 events
listed for the second day. However, the organisers
won through all right. In the Ladies’ Bracelet
Stakes an incident unparalleled in the history of
coursing occurred. Berseker, who was favorite at
the calling of the card, went out non-favorite in his
first course against White Cockade. Berseker is a
son of the famous Beauty Spot and comes from the
Bennett kennels. His owner openly stated that he
wasn’t much good, and as the crowd behind White
Cockade are a heavy betting lot it was weight of
money that made the latter favorite when the pair
went to the slips for the first round. White Cockade
won very easily and looked to have a mortgage on
the stake. He, however, broke a toe and had a
lump of skin knocked off his stifle as the result of
a collision with the judge’s horse when he met
Tommy’s Love in the first ties. Finally the stake
went to Keep Battling, a beautifully-formed brindle
bitch owned by Bateman and Keighley. In the
Champion Cup Happy-Go-Lucky heat Hazeldenc in
the final go. The latter is undoubtedly one of the
best bitches in the State, but she has been worked
to death this season. H. V. Foy bought her after her
defeat and proposes taking her to Maoriland, hoping
to win the Australasian Waterloo Cup with her next
August. The Girraween Stakes, decided on the second
day, drew attention to the White Hope—Triple Crown
puppy Lament, who, although only 13 months old,
was runner up in the Stake. Dame’s Hope, who
heat her. is over six months her senior.

He was well down to young Jock Hutchinson:
When bunkered at the fourteenth hole he was not
heard to say
The customary things ere moving on.
A stymie at the 15th left him mute. The crowd,
perplext,
Watched while with stricken face he plodded
dumbly to the next.
He faced the dreaded Eden hole —and promptly sliced
his drive.
All hung expectant on his downcast lips.
No oath, however, came from them: he scarce

Such was his seeming silence at his slips.
And when he ultimately lost the match, though
bathed in gloom,
He still apparently maintained the silence of

MISREPRESENTATION.
IMPROPER PASSING OFF.
TOOTAL BROADHURST LEE CO., LTD.,
OBTAIN AN INJUNCTION.
Specialisation is the spirit of the Age, and
one of the most interesting tendencies is the
disposition of the modern manufacturer to
identify his goods by means of Trade-marks.
This system must continue to develop if
Great Britain is to maintain her pre-eminent
position in the markets of the world, because
identification tends to a higher standard of
production. Thousands of pounds are ex-
pended yearly in advertising registered
Trade-marks, and in many instances this
widespread publicity has made the public so
familiar with these lines that the Trade-
mark actually supplants the ordinary name
of the goods in question. This sometimes
leads to merchants unintentionally passing
off to the buying public ordinary goods under
the name of the genuine trade-marked article,
whilst, on the other hand, an unscrupulous
trader may be tempted to substitute an imi-
tation as the genuine article.
A case under notice is that of the Tootal
Broadhurst Lee Company, Limited, of Man-
chester, Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers
of high-class cottoh fabrics. This is an old-
established and reputable company, and is
the proprietor of the following registered
Trade-marks, which have been extensively
advertised in Australia and throughout the
world, viz:—“Tobralco,” a cotton fabric of
high quality, for dresses and shirts;
“Tarantulle,” a finer fabric for lingerie
and baby wear; “Lis sue” handkerchiefs
for ladies; “Pyramid” and “Lova” handker-
chiefs for men; “Tootal Cloth,” a plain or
corded velvet “Tootal Pique,” “Tootal Shirt-
ings” and “Narnrit,” a high-class voile in
white and colored designs.
The Company recently discovered that there
existed in Sydney a widespread practice of
passing off to the public cotton fabrics im-
properly described and represented as their
genuine trade-marked lines. Tootal Broad-
hurst Lee Company, Limited, in the inter-
ests of their customers and the public, took
immediate steps to stop this method of trad-
ing. Their solicitors, Messrs. Minter, Simp-
son and Company, of Sydney, were in-
structed to engage agents to investigate the
matter. A three days’ investigation yielded
astounding results. It was ascertained that
no less than 25 business firms in Sydney
were selling cotton fabrics improperly de-
scribed as the genuine Tootal Broadhurst
Lee Company, Limited, products. Acting
upon the advice of their solicitors, Tootal
Broadhurst Lee Company, Limited, at once
ihstituted proceedings in Equity against
several of these firms. In all cases in which
proceedings were instituted, with one excep-
tion, they were withdrawn at the request of
the defendants, who entered into bonds
against any future passing off and paid all the
costs incurred by Tootal Broadhurst Lee
Company, Limited, in instituting proceed-
ings. In the one case in which the matter
was taken into court, an Injunction was
granted by Mr. Justice Harvey in the Equity
Court on February 23, until the hearing of
the Suit.
In many cases the defaulters produced
evidence showing that the goods had been
purchased by them in good faith from whole-
salers as the guaranteed “Tootal” products.
In other cases it was found that ill-informed
shop assistants had misrepresented the goods
without their employer’s authority or know-
ledge. It was with a view to bringing be-
fore the public and trade generally the fact
that their registered Trade-marks are pro-
tected, that the Company sought an injunc-
tion against one defaulter. Under Australian
law the person who actually passes off and
the person who originally passes off are
equally liable apart altogether from the lia-
bility of employers, under Section 29 of the
Prices Fixing Act.
The Tootal Broadhurst Lee Company,
Limited, are not claiming damages. They
seek, as stated before, to protect the buyer
and seller of their fabrics, and to establish a
respect for their registered trade-marks. —

A high-class jeweller’s business depends for
growth on its reputation. Few people have
an intimate knowledge of the value of Gems,
or of the thousands of articles of a jeweller’s
stock.
Hence a high-class jewellery business to be
successful must be built on foundations of
absolute reliability.
Reliability on statements of qualities.
Reliability on statements of values.
Reliability of wearing features.
Reliability on the latest fashions.
In short, on CHARACTER. As our business has
shown increases every year for forty years past
(except 1914) we feel that the public accords
us a good reputation for reasonable prices and
reliable goods.

Sydney's most popular show of the week:
There is room for only about 60 in the draughty,
comfortless gallery of Justice Gordon’s Divorce
Court; and the old birds, hungering for a sigjl.t
of the “escaped nun,” were bright and early in the
queue in King-street. Some were there at 7 o’clock
ready to tyke the narrow stairs two at a stride
when guarding Johns lifted the barrier at lo
o’clock. The wails of a couple of women chopped
off when the 60 had been tallied through was like
an echo from Purgatory. More females bustled up
and stood fast. They knew the iirst 60 would be
thrown out for lunch, and that those holding their
ground for another four hours would be first out
of the slips next time. And wait on they did—
hundreds of them, men, women and infants —some
dour and silent, some giggling at the witticisms of
the push. An escaped nun! It was luscious!
Eleven months ago a nun of the Presentation
Order (Sister Liguori) left Mt. Erin Convent at
Wagga (N.S.W.), barefooted, in a hurry and her
nightie. She was followed, taken back and put to
bed. Later she disappeared again in her bare feet
and brief raiment, and dodged the search-party.
Then the Bishop of Wagga took a hand, and on
his information a warrant was issued for the arrest
of the scantily-attired young woman as a person
of unsound mind, without means of support. She
was taken charge of by “a person in plain clothes,”
examined by a Sydney alienist, declared to be sane
and discharged—and lias since been the special cure
of Ulster. The objurgations and blasts of Christian
sympathy which the newspapers sent -resounding over
the continent 1.1 months ago culminated in the lady
who parted from Mother Church without a wardrobe
throwing a writ for £5OOO damages at Bishop
Dwyer; hence the queue in King-street and the com-
mandeering of the Divorce Court in order that an
army of pressmen might have room. As expected,
the great dailies rose to the occasion. Here was a
real job. The sky was their limit of space.
Grey, lean Ferguson is the trial Judge.. The gal-
lery listens with resignation to Shand, K.C., open
the case for the plaintiff. He does it for an hour
and a half. Shand is a laborious orator, never at
his ease in haranguing total strangers. He usually
gets rid of his opening facts very much after the
manner of a person handing pianos out of a ware-
house. The eyes of the gallery wandering over the
space below see the backs of two women in proximity
to Shand —one broad and straight, the other narrow,
with drooping shoulders. Which is the nun? A
little distance off is the back of a burly, rugged man
in black. No mistaking that figure, anyhow. It is
Joseph Wilfred Dwyer, son of a State-school teacher
in the long ago whose two sons have become bishops.
Shand, having been driven to fury occasionally
during his long journey by the scarcely audible but
derisive cackle of Campbell, K.C., who appears for
the defendant, at last subsides with the remark:
“Call Bridget Partridge.” The drooping shoulders
straighten, and the lady walks slowly into the
witness box. At last the gallery has her in the
spotlight.
A sedate figure. The writer had seen Bridget
Partridge at the Reception House in Darlinghurst last
August, and remembered a plump, rosy-faced woman,
who seemed a good five years younger than her 30
years. On Thursday he had to look hard to identify
her. She is now pale, much thinner in face and body
and wears glasses. Dressed in sombre clothes and
subdued milliner}', Bridget commenced her evidence
shyly. The shyness disappeared in a few minutes
and she quickly answered Shand’s lead. Yet during
the seven hours she stood in the box the air of
timidity never left her. The mobile lower lip was
often trembling. The wide, grey eyes reflected won-
der, and perhaps fear—never resentment. Camp-
bell’s cross-examination of her story was unsparing.
Whatever she may have thought of its effect, her
bearing never changed, nor the suggestion of won-
der leave her eyes.
Very briefly Bridget’s story is that in July last,
being ill, she became satisfied that the other nuns
were going to murder her; that she was going to
be done to death with the cognisance of the visiting
physician; and that, taking no chances, she bolted.
The Bishop’s story is that he acted in the best inter-
ests of the vanished colleen and on the information
given him liad the best reason for believing her
demented. Incidentally, the law on the subject of a
person’s liability to action in respect of lunacy if
he “acts in good faith and with reasonable cause”
is very clear. He is under no liability. A difficult
question may be who shall determine the meaning of
“good faith” —Judge or jury? On " the first day
Ferguson, most learned of Judges, seemed worried
about the matter, and said it would have to be
argued later. But the time for that had not been
reached when this page went to press.
Having had a surfeit of pyjama and bed-
room comedies, Sydney's jaded palate is
being tickled with "refined” vaudeville. The
Humphrev Bishop company is supplying the
change of diet at the Palace, and although
it hasn’t a performer as droll as the late
Pelissier, who pioneered this form of enter-
tainment in London, or as versatile as the
late Sydney James, its leading exponent in
Australia, the fare it gives for the money is
abundant in quantity and excellent in parts.
Particularly good of its kind is the comic
stuff of Joe Brennan, and the audience
wonders in the interval why indifferent im-
portations get engagements in pantomime and
musical comedy, while a thoroughly capable
comedian like Joseph has bear left to pur-
sue the means of existence in Zanzibar and
Mesopotamia. Of course lie committed the
serious fault of getting born in Australia.
Supporting Brennan there are three tuneful
singers—Louise Meadows, a soprano, \\alter
Kingsley, a baritone, and Maurice Jaffrey, a
tenor; two onto sotibrottos —(Jela Ilordie and
Ida Newton ; an elocutionist who sings rag-
time, a comedian who juggles (or a juggler
who comedesj and a ventriloquist. r l here is
also a chic French lady who warbles ditties
at the piano, and the orchestra contains a
drummer who is a master of his quaint
craft.
At Sydney King’s Hall, Alexander Watson
is showing his poetry treasure-trove. Ihe
golden voice is as thrilling as when Australia
first heard it. though the man who knows
more poems than anybody else in the world
confesses to feeling a slight strain when lus
two-hour performance is ended. Shakspeare
has had two innings, and this (Thursday;
night is to be given up mostly to Barrie.
The double-bed in "Scandal” will be made
up for the last time-—in Sydney, at all
events —to-morrow night. On Saturday the
new Theatre Royal will back its
doors and disclose "Adam and Eva, ’ a re-
vised version of a bit of trouble that is sup-
posed to have begun live thousand years ago
—or it may have been five million, or live
billion.
"Firefly,” at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, may
not be attracting quite as much public in-
terest as the show at the top of King-street.
For one thing, it lias been running for many
weeks longer. Still it has its faithful
patrons; and as it is now, in its last nights
"they are rallying round for a last cheer in
a loyal fashion.
Our own vivacious mermaid concluded her

“A Message from Mars” is at Sydney
Lyceum and Crystal Palace all this week,
and Horace Parker (Bert Lytell), the most
selfish man in London, is undergoing a
vacuum-cleaning of his heart and soul.
Never till the last speck of selfishness has
been drawn from Herbert’s interior does
the awe-inspiring Martian return to his
own planet. The Hay market and Globe
scintillate with a I)e Mille production called
“Forbidden Fruit,” in which the prohibited
pippin is a fascinating sewing girl. The
Adam in the case is a wealthy bachelor who
can’t have his Eve because she is the wife
of a bad, bad man who stumbles home every
dawning in spite of prohibition. You know
the old happy ending. At the Strand
Eileen Percy is that anomaly, “The Blush-
ing Bride,” and big-eyed Sylvia Bremer is
“Respectable by Proxy.” At Hoyt’s, Elaine
Hammerstein wins the heart of her obdurate
father-in-law by becoming his stenographer.
At any rate, after a few weeks he is glad to
give her his blessing and send her home.
“Katinka,” one of the brightest comedy-
operas of thgm all. was sure of an affectionate
greeting at Melbourne Royal last Saturday.
The music is mostly good; the scenes of the

followed by the street in Old Stamboul and
the inevitable l'aris restaurant where matri-
monial misunderstandings sink in a sea of
revelry and the head waiter usually has a
finger in the pie, are well dressed and staged ;
and the narrative has all the conventional
charm of a cheap novelette. Lovers
estranged by the sordid schemes of a shock-
ingly respectable mamma; arrival of slan-
dered tenor on the day his own sweet Blossom
marries elderly blighter whose other wife fled
to a harem to escape his cruelty ; escape of
bride in motor-car of friendly comic man who
gets impossibly embarrassed when his wife
comes to claim him —all that, and then ex-
planations all round. Except that the
explanations fall upon the entertainment in a
hurry, like a thunderbolt from Heaven, the
plot is ingenious. With Gladys Moncrieff,
Phil Smith, Roberts, John Forde and huge
Oliver Peacock back in their original places,
the opera looks very like its old self. Miss
Moncrieff is an even more pleasing bride than
ever, Smith has a part which controls his
tendency to clown and incites him to a weak
attempt at ’Murkan accent, Roberts subdues
his weird emotional tremolo, and the bulk of
Peacock is not out of place. Male newcomers
to the cast, as far as Melbourne remembers,
are Leslie Holland as a droll cafe manager
in search of Circassian dancers, and Robert
Chisholm as the* bearded bridegroom who
drives Katinka to elopement. The part re-
quires little from Chisholm save a good bari-
tone voice and a well-clothed figure. These
goods he supplies, with gestures to match.
Zoe Wenke, in place of Olive Godwin,
amounts to a falling-off in volume of sound
and strength of personalitv where the har-
emed wife of Strogoff is concerned, and the
same remarks apply to Mione Stewart, as
the wife of Phil Smith, formerly played by
Florence Young. Still, Mione has a full
sense of humor, and a tuneful little warble,
and both she and Chisholm may be excused
for looking too voung. The chorus, a trifle
out of tune at the beginning, does solid
work. Amery sisters do well in their re-
spective dances with Francis Whyte, and
minor parts are neatly filled by George Con-
yngham and Flossie Lusk, the damsel in par-
ticular promising to shine somewhat pre-
sently if she modifies her touch of assertive-
ness.
At Melbourne King’s the Marie Tempest
Co. keeps the less unintelligent half of the
public talking about “The Great Adventure,”
and inquiring for Arnold Bennett’s novel at
the bookshops. The book, unfortunately, is
mostly not to be had, but its dramatised ver-
sion, now in the fourth week, will be avail-
able until 'further notice. The innovation
of a soloist between the acts brought Adelina
Leon into the limelight last Saturday. The
’cellist makes the intervals interesting.
Levitzki, at Melbourne Town Hall, con-
tinues to excite admiration with his treatment
of fine music in many moods. The immen-
sity of the Heifetz boom left the musical
world somewhat tired, but the merits of the
versatile pianist have aroused a suspicion
that the order of enthusiasm would have
been reversed had he got in first. x\fter the
opening fugue, which appeals to superior
souls only, Levitzki charms everybody. He
deals it out to the instrument, right and left,
left and right; also he lingers it with airy
grace, and everything he touches turns to
gold, Or, strictly speaking, to notes. The
receipts will be further increased to night
(Thursday) and on Saturday, after which
some extra concerts will doubtless include
matinee or two.
The nights of “Oh, Lady, Lady !’’ are num-
bered at Melbourne Majesty’s. For one more
week Dorothy Brunton will get married to
her brother burglar in a grotesque costume
that ends in the frilled pantaloons of a
bygone age; and then comes "The Lilac
Domino.”
Frank Mayo heads the week's sensations
at Hoyt’s, Melbourne. As the noble hero
of “Tiger True” he dips into Noo Yoik's
underworld to light fearsome odds for the
lady of hi.s heart. Clara Wieth, a Danish
star, reveals the,effect of dwelling in “The
House of Fatal Love,” but her misfor-
tunes are not so distressing as Elaine Ham-
inerstein's in "The Point of View.” Elaine
ha.s to play the resourceful daughter in a
family that has suffered a financial crash;
and she has an exhausting job trying to
restore the manhood of her bewildered dad
and brothers. At the Majestic Norma Tal-
madge is enduring the stigma of A Branded
Woman” with the help of a good dressmaker
and a few tiaras, while Blanche Sweet ap-
pears as a humble heroine in a lively film
version of Bret Harte’s “Fighting Cressy."
"Forbidden” is raging at-the Britannia, and
the Melba is collecting baksheesh with a
double bill—the obese Arbuckle in “The Bell
Bov” and Lois Weber in “What’s Worth
While.”
# * O
Adelaide has said so-long to Lizette
Parkes, and now the Prince of Wales’s has a
monopoly of the spoken drama. The Fuller
season there has opened with Guy Hastings
as a manly clergyman whom the adventuress
entraps into marriage; Darcy Kelway is
reliable as comic relief, and Yetty Landau,
well remembered as a humorist, is serious this
time. The Fullers compete strenuously with
variety at the King’s. Laura Guerite still
tops the bill in the re-opened house, but
Edwards and Parkes have a funny sketch,
Corona makes good music, and Baisdeu
almost gets some new points out of trick
cycling. At West’s House Peters is a
square-jawed cave-man type of hero, with
Snub Pollard as comic relief. At the Majes-
tic Norma Talmadge is equally square-jawed,
in a feminine way, in a “Passion Flower”
drama of Spain. Wondergrapli handles the
gentler emotions with Constance Binney in
a. “Stolen Kiss,” and the Pav. has the elabo-
rate foolishness of Mack Sennet in “A Small
Town Idol,” with incidental glimpses of the
film-making life. A School of Mines recep-
tion given by president Langdon Bonython to
a school-teachers’ congress has brought
prominently before the public two really fine
singers, Una Andrews (contralto) and
Arnold Ashworth (baritone).
“Yarrabin”: Who is Miss Daunt, de-
scribed in Paris as “the well-known Austra-
lian danseuse”? She is one of the principal
solo-steppers at the Opeth de Paris in
“Antar,” and outstrips the most daring
Parisiennes. You know what I mean.
“Ancient Prompter”: Though he never
attained to eminence, Wally Chalinor was an
excellent comedian and a dear, good soul. Tf
he had a fault—but, there, who amongst us
is averse from taking a spot or two when
pals are around? It is many years ago, but
I well remember the night when Wally
arrived in his dressing-room obviously half-
seas over. Always the little gentleman, he
apologised to me, but excused himself by
remarking, “You know what these birthdays
are, ol’ boy.” I did. It was his second that
week. I was rather anxious as to how he
would comport himself when he got on the
stage, but I needn’t have worried. Sitting
down to make up, Wally caught sight of his
face in the mirror. Wagging a stick of
grease-paint he apostrophised his reflection
for several minutes. “You dishipated
thing!” said he. “How dare you come into
a ’spectable 'theatre in thish state! Dis-
grasheful! Meetin’ ladish an’ gen’l’men of
hon’rable profession half-tanked! ’Shamed
of you, Mr. Chal’nor —’shamed an’ dishgusted
—ugh !” In the midst of this moral harangue
a knock sounded on the door and our
business manager entered. Gloom was on
his brow. He informed us brokenly that
news had just been received that Queen Vic-
toria had died, and there would be no per-
formance that night. Wally gave a sob and
rose to his feet. Weeping copiously, he re-
marked : “Poor, dear lady! Gone! Such a
sweet Queen an’ mother ! What a blow for
us all! But it’s a good thing it happened
to-night. If I’d ever got on _ the stage I’d
ha’ been hissed off for a cert!”

POVERTY
POINT
“Stargazer”: Claude Bantock was a leth-
argic actor; and in a part cast in the mould
in which he was originally formed, Claude
could be excellent. During one season in
Melbourne he had to play a character who
went to sleep under a large bandana handker-
chief on an easy chair. He was under his
handkerchief for about five minutes, and
when stirred came to life so naturally that
he always got a hand for it. “It’s the most
natural bit of acting you ever did, Bantock,”
said an Age man one day. “You wake up
most, humanly. What a pity they can’t keep
you awake!” “Of course, it’s natural,” was
the reply. “It’s actual. You don’t think I
waste those five minutes, do you? No darned
fear. I go to sleep !”
“Rienzi”: The late C. R. Bantoek at his
brightest was always worth hearing. During
a rehearsal for the first Australian produc-
tion of “The Merry Widow” I remember
“Katinka," at
Melbourne Royal.
Phil Smith as
Thaddeus T. Hopper.
him getting a rak-
ing for the slug-
gishness of his en-
trance in a parti-
cular scene. Court-
ney, one of the
most exacting pro-
ducers jimmy
Williamson had
ever employed, was
responsible for the
criticism, and
Bantock went
through the rest of
the rehearsal crest-
fallen. Just before
the final, however,
Courtney, who had
been explaining a
little matter of
decorum to an-
other mummer,
wa s temporarily
illumined by the
spotlight. This
was Bantoek’s op-
portunity. “I say,
Mr. Courtney,” he
said feelingly.
“Yes?” inquired
Courtney without
moving. “M r.
Courtney,” con-
tinued Bantock
plaintively, “don't
let the spot-
light go down upon your wrath.” The
quip brought a general laugh; but its genu-
ine appeal was not to be denied, and good
relations were restored.
“S.T.S.”: Perhaps the best chance Ban-
tock got after the Rajah of Bhong was as
the muddled parent of “The Little Michus”
who had in the long ago mixed up his own
infant daughter with an adopted one. Fred
Leslie was sent to straighten out the tangle,
and the contrast between the stolid Bantock
and the staccato Leslie methods was great.
One remembers with pleasure that Bantock,
after being patronised and worried through
a long scene, was allowed to get a bit of
his own back at the finish.. Some plan having
been proposed, “Right!” said Leslie in a high
treble; “I’m agreeable.” “Wrong!” said
Bantock in a deep bass; “you’re not.” Later
Lauri took a turn at lecturing him: “My
good sir, don’t stand there occupying valu-
able space, and sucking up the oxygen that
we all require. Go home and massage the
parrot.” And Bantock faded off the scene,
the very picture of amiable futility—which,
indeed, was his strong point on the stage.
“Wodgil” : Enid and Marjorie Bennett are
natives of York (W.A.), where their father
was a domiuie. York is a placid hamlet
with a racecourse, a river and a tradition
that Henry Iteveley, who was Shelley’s
friend in Italy until the waters of the Spez-
zian Gulf closed over the restless poet, took
up land in the neighborhood when the Set-
tlement was young. Marjorie, albeit a
comely lass, hasn’t Enid’s violet-eyed, droop-
ing-lily type of loveliness, but she is a
better actress. Artistically the difference
between the sisters may be expressed" in a
syllable. Enid is self-conscious; Marjorie
is self-confident. In that one syllable there
is all the difference in the world.
“Alwyn”: In U.S.A. things theatrically,
as far as prices are concerned, are “taking
a tumble.” Three musical comedies bn
Broadway are running with $2.50 as top
price. Managers freely assert that the rever-
sion to pre-war figures has come to stay, and
the general impression is that top prices
next season will be's2.so for dramatic and
$3 for musical shows, while optimists (in
an authoritative position) assert: that $2
for dramatic and $2.50 for musical produc-
tions will prevail. Lee Shubert, Sam 11.
Harris, Archibald Selwyn, A. 11. Woods and
John Mcßride are names frequently men-
tioned in support of this prophecy.
“Snell”: Dan Barry whs playing a dis-
guised version of “The Silver King” at
Ham i 11 on, and
there had been a
row in the house
at which the cq.
waa do ssin g, a
brother lodger com-
plaining that he
had been robbed of
seven bottles of
beer that were in a
cupboard handy to
his room. Naturally
all adjacent actors
were suspect, but
the real culprit could
not be traced. That
night, however, the
elderly young Wil-
fred Denver played
a drunken gentle-
man so splendidly
that the house was
enthusiastic. A t
last, on one out-
burst of applause, a
man in the hall
looked round in in-
dignant protesta-
tion. “Shut up, you
bloomin* fools!” he
roared. “He isn’t
actin’ —• that’s the
blighter who stole
my beer!”
“Scandal," at Sydney
Criterion.
Emma Temple as the
perturbed Brownie.
Bert Levy writes from a Cunard liner
“somewhere in the Atlantic” :
In the smoking saloon I’ve just picked up a
Bulletin and found myself referred to as an “ex-
Australian.” Whadyer mean? I’ve never been any-
thing but an Australian. I have been “Bert Levy,
the Australian Artist-Entertainer,” in 480 cities
of the United States, as well as all through Eng-
land, France, Germany and Austria, during the last
15 years. My only child, a boy, gave his life for
our colors. 1 was offered the position of officer of
the U.S. Army in charge of war posters, but I
couldn’t take it, for in order to don the uniform
I would have been compelled to become a U.S. citi-
zen. Don’t do it again, for I still feel the “call of
the bush,” and I am going home some day.
“Pongo”: Bruce R. Hutton, amateur
mummer, has an autograph-book that con-
tains the signature of every visiting actor,
vocalist and instrumentalist of any conse-
quence who has appeared in Sydney in the
past 20 years. It is about lOin. long, Bin.
wide and 6in. thick, and encased in an iron
box for protection. Once the proud owner
offered to leave it overnight with the late
Villiers Arnold, so that he could add his
quota to the collection. “No,” said V.A.,
“bring it to-morrow. I wouldn’t make my-
self responsible for that book —it’s price-
less.”
“C. Ockney”: Miss Horniman, a theatrical
manageress, who did more for repertory in
England than all the other managers put
together, has tired of her expensive hobby
and finally retired from the job of educating
the public. For nearly 20 years she ran
the Gaiety Theatre at Manchester, and fre-
quently took her company to London’s West
End. On the recent closing night the dis-
appointed lady spoke of the occasion as “a
funeral where the corpse is expected to get
on its hind legs and speak.” The play
selected for this final performance, by the
way, was “The K.C.,” written by Dion

“Pot Still”: Prohibition is making itself
felt in Amurrican stage-productions if not
in the movies. Photo-plays continue to ex-
hibit more or less “festive” boards with an
occasional happy drunk in evidence, but
the spoken drama is becoming painfully dry.
In “Oh, Lady, Lady!” our latest musical-
comedy from Uncle Sam’s factory, there is
never the sign of a drink the whole long
evening, nor do I recall that one is men-
tioned. This is the more remarkable con-
sidering that the curtain rises on the hero’s
wedding-day, that during the evening another
wedding takes place, and that yet one more
is booked for an early date. In the old days
the stage would have been swimming in cock-
tails and fizz.
“J.E.H.” (Loud.) : Australian Daphne
Pollard has temporarily quitted revue and
is doing well in a single turn in the London
halls. At time of writing she is at the Pal-
ladium. where three shows are given daily.
One critic calls her the “uncrowned queen of
low comedy, whether as a smutty-nosed
domestic fed up with life, or an irresponsible
nursemaid ‘throwing the glad’ in the park.”
And the Paix Mall says she's going far in
variety.
“Don”: Early in the ’nineties the old
Opera House, Melbourne, had a mild sen-
sation, due to the old-fashioned practice of
throwing bouquets on the stage. One of the
artists ((Jeorgie Defoe), wife of well-known
burnt-cork performer Charlie Fanning, made
the n:ght hideous with her raucous voice, and
the dissentient galleryites threw halfpennies
and over-ripe posies on the stage. Hut the
singer kept going until a patron threw a
sheep’s pluck at her feet. That moved her to
tears. Iler husband and the leading com-
edian (Will Whitburn) were soon in the
gallery, offering a fiver to the person who
would point out the culprit “who frew dat.
pluck.” But there were no takers.
“Adelaide”: It seems odd to find Sydney
and Melbourne analysing Arnold Bennett’s
“Great Adventure” as a new play. Thanks
to our Repertory Theatre, we in Adelaide
have known it by heart for years.
“Private Boxer”: These cheerful mum-
mers! Here’s “T.D.M.” (B. 30/6/'2l)
assuring me that, as Cyril Mackay was play-
ing in “De Luxe Annie” when that piece
was in the bills, his absence from the stage
“has not been protracted.” Well, I’m pre-
pared; to swear that “De Luxe Annie” has
not bfien seen—in Sydney, at any rate —for
over a year. If to the actor-people 12
months is not a protracted period to be out
of Work, I thank my stars that I’m only a
looker-on at the game.
“Hamer”: Young Morrisey, son of the old
snake-man, having been bred in the snake
business, has picked up a good knowledge
cf antidotes, and is, as “Australia’s Reptile
King,” exhibiting in South Africa, where he
allows himself to be bitten by the worst
snakes known to the country without show-
ing ill effects. After Africa, India is on his
programme, and he hopes to pick up the
standing prize offered by the Indian Govern-
ment for a cure for the bite of the cobra,
which “Professor” Fox was seeking when
the deadly krait put an end to the quest.
“E.K.”: At a Brisbane- theatre the other
night I saw a beautiful Australian .setting.
The blue-gums looked good, and the fire and
the billy seemed genuine, and the quartette
of swaggies were almost perfect, their posing
being exceptionally fine. They sang “Roll
on, lazy Mississippi!”
“Ancient Prompter”: It was not “Joseph
and His Brethren” that “the dark-haired
charmer, Dorothy Dix,” appeared in here
(B. 23/6/’2l), but the other semi-religious
entertainment, “Ben Hur.” In both pieces,
curiously enough, the part of the hero over-
shadows that of the heroine, and that
wouldn’t do in these days. In the former
play the leading lady was Ethel Warwick,
w r ho, when she back to England, divorced
her husband, Ldmund Waller, a son of the
late Lewis.
“0.K.”: Onlv the most ancient Australian
theatre-goer treasures any recollection of
Horace Lingard; he was before my time,
anyhow, and that goes back 40 years. Early
Bulletin reminiseers used to talk of Ling-
ard’s touring, but it was mostly about the
manager’s beautiful wife, Alice, who was the
company’s chief attraction. The old man is
now 84 and in broken health, and a testi-
monial matinee was worked up for him in
London recently. Courtneidge lent the Savoy
Theatre for the friendly rally.
“Fax”: One of these days Isadora Duncan
may introduce her Art to this country
Isadora doesn’t really go as far as Maud
Allan, though she demands more limelight.
Maud used her legs in particular and her
arms, body and face to show us the spirit
of Mendelssohn, Chopin, etc.; Isadora—a
man plays the piano while she interprets
Brahms, Wagner, Chopin, Schubert or
Liszt (of all people!) with her face, arms
and hands. Needless to say, there is a lot
of bluff about it. Human imagination in
general fails to discover meaning in a lot
of the music which cranks profess to. find
fully descriptive, and Isadora’s powers of
expression are' insufficiently various to turn
the mud into glass. The novelty soon palls
on the common or garden soul. It really
palls on msthetic mortals, too; but their first
purpose in life is to be enraptured when
other people are bored stiff.
“Harrison 0“ : The longer “Chu CliiD
Chow” lasts, the bulkier Oscar Asche be-
comes. A Turkish bath which he has had in-
stalled in his home is one of the methods he
employs .for waging an offensive aga nst his
alarming avoirdupois; but up to date his
“Katinka," at
Melbourne Royal.
Oliver Peacock an the

salient has resisted

ine is likewise
proving a fat part
for Lily Brayton.
The lady was be-
ginning to put on
flesh when last in
Austr a 1 i a, but
what then seemed
little more than a
not unpleasing ex-
periment has de-
veloped into a
habit. Since
“Cbu” was put on
at II i s Majesty’s
0500 plays hav?
been produced in
London, 550 o f
which have since
vanished. At time
of writing it has
just scored its
2.132nd perform-
ance, and Oscar
advertises in the
Times that the re-
port that it is
shortly to be with-
drawn is a base
fabrication. The
people interested in
it s “sudden de-
mise” are, pre-
sumably, Beer-
bohm Tree’s exe-
cutors, who when
they are able to
regain possession
of His Majesty’s
will be able to ask
u largely increased rent. Asche got the
playhouse for “the run of the piece,” no-
body suspecting that the said run was going
to develop into a marathon.
“Ibsenshaw”: The recent Sydney produc-
tion of “The Way of the World” (hats off
to it!) recalls that it Avas as Mistress Milla-
ment that Ethel Irving seized the chance
to show she was not merely a song-and-dance
artist. Congreve’s piece was put up by the
Stage Society for a Sunday night in London,
and the producer had the inspiration to give
the part to the aspiring Ethel, in whom he
thought he detected ability far beyond that
of the ordinary “girl” of the musical farces
then in vogue. 'He was right.
“Pongo”: The first Sydney performance of
“H.M.S. Pinafore” was staged by Kelly and
Leon in the Sydney School of Arts some-
where about 40 years ago. Kelly essayed
Sir Joseph Porter; Leon, a fine female im-
personator, played Josephine. It had a very
short run, for J.C.W., who owned the Aus-
tralian rights, took legal action. Kelly- after-
wards played Sir Joseph in the J.C.W.
production : but his partner was not placed.
I can’t remember Josephine being played by
a male since then.
“T. D. Emdee”: “Fax” is not the only
one who noticed the thin tone in Heifetz’s
playing (B. 30/G/’2l), and I cannot see
that he has greater technique than Remenyi,
the Hungarian whom I heard pley in the
old Opera House, Sydney, in 1884. The
Hungarian virtuoso was a fine exponent of
Paganini, and to hear him play the “Witches’
Dance” was an education in violin methods.
Remenyi, I fancy, played on a Guanerius,
and he is said to have picked up another for
a song in a Sydney paAvnshop.
“Snell”: The genial manager had met
Flohm with mutual friends, and after a
pleasant evening had said: “Come round one
evening and see the show. Bring your wife.”
Next night Flohm was on the mat with five
sons and daughters. The manager ran an
eye over the neAV-found tribe, and said he
with a trace of sarcasm, “Why didn’t you
bring the wife?” Flohm raised palms of
expostulation. “No, no, no!” sa:d he. “Dot
iss too mooch for once. Rebecca she vill
come mit der resd of der children to-morrow
night.” And Rebecca did, bringing four of
the family. When next the management met
Flohm the latter was quite pleasant about it.
“Dot vos fine,” he said. “Any time you vant
an audience don’t fail to let me know. I got
more as 70 relations in Melbourne. And
some day perhaps you can do me a good
turn.”
WALKING BACK,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At the Blink “The Guy Carousel's”
Broke and parted in the night.
Here dog Carlo tore my trousers
When I went to beg a bite.
This rail journey never ceases—
Tears suffuse my aching eyes ;
Brothers band, and go to pieces,
But I’m sticking to the ties.
Walking back with boot-soles flapping,
Tortured toes exposed to view
Through the scraps of paper-wrapping
That for socks will have to do.
Limping on a wretched blister.
While the railroad brightly shines —

Working on familiar lines!
With a measured footstep tramping
Past the little listless towns,
In a hollow gum-butt camping,
Begging meat from country clowns ;
Now within a draughty cowshed
I will rest and nourish me.
All his pride must Lister now shed—
One of this stock company 1
Morning comes: the aching worse is;
Dust clouds drifting on before:
None to give a brace of curses,
And the breakfast hour long o’er.
There is here no hope of feeding.
In my stomach swings a pain.

CITROEN
"TV Frcnct Car
Two pairs of semi-canti-
lever super - imposed
springs in the Citroen Car
are fitted to both front and
rear of the chassis. They
not only do away with
shackles, spring bolts and
their oily troubles, but also
act in the place of the
torque rod.
Hig'hest Efficiency and
Lowest Cost of Upkeep.
Ihe Citroen Car combines distinctive beauty with remarkably low
cost of upkeep. Its elegant lines, compact build and smart appear-
ance reflect the perfection of finish that is so characteristic of French
manufacture. Light weight and scientific construction provide
unusual economy of tyre, wear and tear, while
for low fuel consumption it holds the world’s
record. It is sturdily built to stand the strain of
the most testing conditions of road or weather; an
ample margin of safety is allowed in its construction
to remove the possibility of weakness in any part.
Important features exclusive to the
Citroen Car are the famous Citroen
Double Helical Gears that eliminate
wear, and are unusually silent in oper-
ation. The Thermo Syphon system of
cooling the engine requires only 1 1\
pints of water, and positively elimi-
nates over-heating of the engine on the
steepest hill.

Three notable facts marked the G. N.
Hurdle race this year. The finish was the closest
on record, half a head and a neck between the
winner and the third. The three placed horses were
sired by Melbourne Cup winners, Comedy King in
the first case, and Poseidon in the other two. And
the time smin. 35-Jsec., was ofsee. faster than last
year’s, which held the record up to then. The list
of G.N. winners provides an interesting illustration
of how the course lias been levelled and tbe quality
of the jumping horses improved since 1880, when
Ocean won the race in smin. 35jsec., carrying exactly
the sume weight as this year’s victor. Careless
sporting scribes have even instanced the Ocean win
as dividing the record with Fiscom, but the difference
between the two performances is exactly 133yds.
From 1681 until 1886 the (3. N. Hurdle course was
only 2 miles 6 furlongs 307 yards, after which it
was increased to 3 miles, and the times lengthened
accordingly. So the Fiscom of Saturday last beat
the wraith of Ocean, the winner of 35 years ago, by
133yds. And he beat Two Blues by more. Some-
thing happened to poor old Two Blues at the outset
of the race, or had happened before he went to the
post. Instead of merely falling behind at the start,
and making up his leeway as he proceeded, the
veteran lost ground all the time, in a manner quite
unworthy of one who finished only half a length
behind the second in a fast-run Melbourne Cup. Four
weeks earlier, on the same track, Two Blues made
a quite wonderful run that brought him into second
place behind Gold Coin in a two-miles’ hurdle. The
extra mile was bound to favor him, it seemed. Stay-
ing was his long suit. Yet on Saturday lie toiled
hopelessly in the extreme rear, while Gold Coin was
running the lightweight winner to half a head.
Fiscom, from S’Australin, was nearly everybody’s
tip after he ran unluckily at Moohee Valley three
weeks ago. His subsequent unsatisfactory sort of
performance, in a ruce where Telecles took every-
body’s fancy, accounted for his dropping out of
favor and starting at 16 to 1. Apparently, the stable
had half a doubt about the four-year-old Fiscom
being sufficiently seasoned to stay the course if he
made running from the start, consequently he had
the jockey pulling at him most of the time, lie-
straining efforts probably did him more harm than
good, and Telecles might have won but for muking
a bad jump at the last hurdle. Or perhaps the
“good thing” made the bad jump because he was
pretty well exhausted. Anyhow, it was a great go
between the three from the distance post. Nothing
else had looked very dangerous within the last half-
mile or more. The race was to racers only,
being a bad fourth and British Arch fifth. The day
for plebeian-bred animals of “jumping pedigree” is
past, as far as nig hurdle races go. At present,
however, it's too soon to turn all the old horses down
on account of their age, for the two that fought it
out with the four-year-old at the finish numbered
17 years between them.
Nothing occurred on the first day of the V.R.C.
meeting to add interest to the coming Steeplechase.
The long struggle over the big timber looks very
like a race between Mountain God, Monrose, lolaus.
Doiran and, perhaps, Algous. Given a guarantee of
his ability to get round the course comfortably, the
writer would fancy Algous, who won the long steeple-
chase at Caulfield two years ago. But there is the
doubt about his capacity for the Flemington course,
the same as with grey Monrose and several not men-
tioned. Possibly not one of those that are men-
tioned will get the course journey, though the chances
are in favor of Doiran and lolaus. The ultimate
triumph of Mountain God seems highly probable.
With no more than list. 51b. up the. God only wants
good luck to bring him home. Hitherto he has had
his worst luck in the biggest events.

The remarkable thing about the Warwick-
shire match was the last-wickc t stand of Oldfield and
Mai ley. Oldfield’s 123 might just as well have been
made against any other first-class county, for he is
a clinking good bat on his day. and made many
useful scores with the A.I.F. team. lie suffers
from the convention that wicket-keepers are 03
men as bats, and has been sent in too late on this
tour to give him a chance of settling down. Mailey s
46 (n. 0.) would not have been compiled in a manner
inspiring to a ninth-wicket man in pursuit of his
century. Maile.v has developed some fine shots in
the last 12 months, but he never looks like a stayer
when batting. Armstrong got his first century
(117) of the present trip. The pretty Edgbaston
ground, which is on a hill outside Joe Chamberlain s
city and near the famous R.C. school founded by
Newman, is almost as familiar to him as. one of
his home playing-fields. Armstrong hasn’t been
going after the runs (he put himself in fifth wicket-
down in this match), preferring to concentrate on
the bowling which F. S. Jackson says is rotten,
but which has proved so extraordinarily effective.
He heads the combined bowling averages, so far,
with 52 wickets for 12.13.
In the Third Test, which began on Saturday at
Ileadingly, near Leeds, the more or less desperate
step was taken of superseding Douglas by Lionel
Tennvson as captain. It was done apparentlv in
deference to press balderdash about “imagination”
as a winning factor. We had the same sort of
thing here before the Burns-Johnson fight, and again
in connection with Saturday’s Dempsey-Carpentier
fiasco. * It is safe to say that if Douglas isn’t cap-
able of leading England to victory, then a cricketer
with the soaring intellect of a John Milton wouldn’t
do it—any more than Carpentier could have dropped
the bull-like Y r ankee punching-maehine on Saturday
if the brain of a Napoleon had been substituted for
his own. The plain truth is that England has been
up against it since the Tests were resumed, not
only as regards the lack of class-plavers, but in
the matter of consistently evil luck as well. In
this match Hobbs was unable to bat in the first
innings, and presently turned out to be in need
of an immediate operation for appendicitis. Tenny-
gon had his hand smashed by a hot shot from
Macartney. True, Koine in eighth, he somehow
knocked up 63. but his fielding was more or less
settled. And Woolley departed for a blob, having
been offered one of Gregory’s very best in the second
over. The 75 amassed by Douglas was an invalu-
able contribution to the 259 which was the home
team's response to Australia’s opening score of 407.
Woolley caught Andrews and Bardsley off Douglas
before either got going, but the amazing Macartney
came oft with a chanceless 115, and Hellew (52),
Taylor (50) and Armstrong (77) helped further
to invest England with gloom. Also that sound
bat. Carter, made 34.
Macartney’s 115 in the third Test is his
sixth three-figure innings on the tour, and lifted
his aggregate to 1563 runs, averaging 75.38. His
last four innings have been 105, 193, 345 and 115.
Bardsley has notched five centuries, with an aggre-
gate of 1039, averaging 61.11.
Victor Trumpet* has at last got a memorial
—a simple marble slab in the “bob” section at the
Sydney Cricket Ground. It was put there without
ceremonial by a few friends and admirers.
Death has clean bowled Ted Evans for
72 at Walgett (N.S.W.). Evans came to light as
a bowler at a time wh.en Victoria had the advantage
in the intercolonial fixtures; and between 1875 and
1879 he took 119 Victorian wickets at an average
cost of 13. lie was one of the Australian XI that
went to England in 1886.
About the biggest motor-cycle event in the
world is England’s Tourist Trophy Race, which
this vein came oft in the Isle of Man. The winner,
Davies, did the 220 miles in 4hr 9min. 22see.,
but the rider who should have lifted the prize was
the famous Dixon. In the second lap he broke an
inlet-valve spring, and after stopping to fit in a
new one he wore down a field of 62 and finished
only 2jinin. behind his rival. He was on an Indian.
The Dempsey-Carpentier light, ns this
page has been remarking off' and "ort ever since the
affair was first projected, was not. to be taken seri-
ously. It was a little man who bad never beaten
a great lighter, and who had been ‘stopped effectu-
ally by such a third-rater as l’apUe. against a big
man who had done practically ,all that , was ever
asked of him. It was a crUisewelght well past his
prime against a heavyweight at his best. Hugh
1). Mclntosh considered seven years ago that the
Frenchman would make an interesting match of it
with Lea Darcy 1 And that is about the measure
probably of his class. What happened is clear.
Dempsey found in a couple of rounds that Cnrpen-
tier’s famous punch was a fleabite to him, and from
that time he had the fight won. He could no doubt
have battered his man into unconsciousness within
the first, three minutes had he cared to take, the
chance of losing the championship by assuming—
what presently proved to be the fact —that the
visitor was impotent to hurt him. About 100.000
people, including manv thousands of women, paid
heavily to see the farce. But it has to be remem-
bered that the atmosphere of excitement which is
created by the mob itself is the real attraction ; so
that Rickard’s patrons probably consider they got
WELL TRA INED.
"What sort of a game would yon play if we
met the men?"
“Oh, the same as usual —forward and fast. ”
their money's worth, on the whole. The interesting
position in regard to the championship now is that
no white pug. exists who has an earthly hope against
Dempsey. But lurking wolfishly in the background
is one Harry Wills, lie is bigger than Jack John-
son ; cleverer reputedly than Sam McVea; the pos-
sessor of a right-handed clout that is reminiscent
of Sam Langford in the days when the century was
young. If he can get Dempsey into a hempen
square there should be a fight worth paying to see
as a fight. And the pugilistic crown might shift
■ once more to the brow of Africa, where by all the
laws of physiology jt belongs.
Jackie Green came again in great style at
Sydney Stadium on Saturday night, beating Jamito
for skill in practically every one of the 20 rounds
that the affair went. It was a very different Green
from the boy who had put up such a poor showing
against Criqui earlier in the year. At no time did
the Filipino look like being outed: on the other
hand, at no time did he look capable of hurting
Green. The condition of both was superb.
* * * *
Dencio, the Filipino champion, did not
live up to the reputation he had in his own country
after his arrival here. He developed, latterly, a
habit of stopping suddenly, both in his matches and
during training. On these occasions he mentioned
that his head “hurt inside” or was “cold.” In a
Melbourne match with young McCarthy on Saturday
Tiig-lit he stopped for the last time. They took him
to St. Vincent’s Hospital, and he died there of
cerebral haemorrhage, the effect of head injuries re-
ceived in a previous tight. He was a good little
sportsman and a wonderfully fair fighter.
In a game chiefly remarkable for solid
ruck work and hard tackling Easts downed Wests
in the opening round of the N.S.W. Rugby League
City Cup competition at the Sydney Cricket Ground
last Saturday. Scores: 21 points (5 tries 3 goals)
to 14 points (2 tries 4 goals). The centre of the
ground was a quagmire. In the first spell Rex
Norman and A. Oxford notched tries for the Surfers,
the latter converting. During this half Courtney
and Pearce were presented with their walking tickets
—Pearce’s first experience of the sort in 20 years.
Rex Norman got two more tries in the
second half and converted them both. Wright
was responsible for a third. After Pearce’s
departure Wests won the leather more frequently
in the downs, but their backs being unequal to
penetrating the defence they closed up the game ami
adopted spoiling tactics. With only 15 minutes to
play the Surfers led by 21 to 2, and then the Blacks
added 12 points to Easts’ 0 before the final blast.
Watkins, Holmes, and Ives were Easts’ best for-
wards, whilst Caples, Rex Norman and Campbell
were the pick of the backs. For Wests Doig per-
formed spendidly. Downie as custodian was safe
and Vest did everything asked of him. Balmain
and Newtown played a draw (11 points all); Souths
headed St. George by 17 points to 10, and Glebe
walloped ’Varsity by 20 points to 5. Norths (the
bye) went to Toowoomba (Q.) and won by 21
points to 20, and followed that up by defeating a
Buuuualand rep. XIII on Saturday by 24 point' to 18.
The Springboks, in their third victorious
game against N. S. Wales, showed for the first time
the vast difference between S’African and Australian
Rugby Union football. The greasy state of the
Sydney l ni. oval on Saturday was an asset to the
visitors’ forwards, their short, passing rushes being
the right . plSy in the circumstances as against
N-.S.W.’s kick'-ahd-follow-on policy. Dunn was the
pick of tlic hardworking N.S.W. pack. The Spring-
boks broilght. out -some new 'men. notably Strauss,
lie plays centre and is very sound. Zeller under-
studies Van Heerden, blit, is not such an awkward
proposition. Meyer, on the 'other wing, was always
in position| and outpaced’ Raymond. Clarkson Was
again supreme at centre, nhd is undoubtedly the
best man among the visitors’ backs. Kruger stood
out from the forwards, being more like a three-
quarter, anil Ellis and 11. Morkel were the best of
the rest. . >. i

Tancred’s Maorilundcrs beat a Newcastle
XIII on Saturday by 27 points (7 tries 3 goals) to
14 (4 tries 1 goal). McClymont, the tourists’ stand-
off half, played cleverly, and set tiis rearguard in
motion repeatedly. For the All Blacks McClymont,
Woolley, Sanders, Somers (2), Nunn and Paki (tries),
and McClymont, Delgrosso and Poison (goals) wore
the scorers; and for Newcastle Loseoeo (2) and
Lcstieow (tries) and \\ illiams (goal).

B. Laing, five-eighth, is the only M.L.
Leugueite among the 28 just selected to tour Eng-
land ; and the Dominion is annoyed. So is Banana-
land, which is represented by only E. S. Brown
(three-quarter) and N. Potter and W. Richards
(forwards). It is hard to understand how the selec-
tors cattic to turn down those sterling ruckers, ,1.
Rennett/(Q.) and 11. Avery (M.L.). Fraser, as custo-
dian, h‘hs undoubtedly been chosen on past form.
This season he has been below Taplin, Rigney and
Procter,whilst Fewin, the Bananaland full, over-
shadoAved him in the Qiieensland-M.L. v. N.S.W.
match. Still, Fraser, in form, is a magnificent
player in any back position behind half. The
three-quarters should develop into a champion com-
bination. The inclusion of Carstairs. the St. George
colt, came as a shock to many, hut lie is speedv, solid
and intelligent. Robinson, the Balmain star, would have
been a more popular choice. The “stand-off halves’’
are good, but it is a moot question whether Laing,
the Maorilander. should have been preferred to
Dallas Hodgins, North’s crack. Laing is the heavier
man, and perhaps better for heavy turf.
Close on 50,000 spectators stood around the .
big Carlton Oval on Saturday to watch the collision
of the Old Blues and the Collingwood -Magpies.
Up to half-time only a point separated the teams.
Then ’Wood’s second-best forward, Curtis, retired
with a broken rib, so Lee had two men to watch
him, and the visitors couldn’t keep up Carlton’s
scoring rate. Still the game wa« great, Carlton’s
tremendous rushes always yielding some points,
while ’Wood’s system got goals, but not enough.
When the bell rang the Blues had 12 goals 1(>
behinds, ’Wood 10 goals 4 behinds. South revived
their supporters’ fading hopc« by outing ’Roy—66
points to 48. Geelong-, who . haven’t this season
been walloped on their own ground, blotted out
Melbourne with 76 points to 64. their bright for-
ward, Ilagger, achieving a record of 60 games for
his club without a break. A well-regulated ’bailer,
and a lucky one. Also St. Hilda downed Essendon
by 83 points to 42.
* * * *
The Essendons have persuaded Melbourne
City Council to give them a lease of the North Mel-
bourne ground—the old Gluepot out by the gas-
works —from next season on. The motive power was
doubtless the increased “gate,” but the unseemly action
so upset North’s committee that the club resigned
from the Association, forfeited the rest of its
matches and got its players transferred to other clubs.
It is a pity to sec the old club disappear, for, under
the town’s then name of Ilotham, it held its own
with Geelong, Melbourne and Ca-lton away back in
’77 ; and since the Association was formed in ’97 it
has' won the pennant often and once played for
nearly three years without a defeat.
Joe Kirkwood, the Australian golfer, lias
convinced competent foreign critics that he is a
world’s champion in the making, but his day i fi to
come. In the onen championship at St. Andrew's
the Victorian tied for sixth place with Barnes,
Hagen and four others, .Tock Hutchison, the Scotch-
American pro. (he used to be a caddie at St.
Andrew’s) winning after a tie with the British
amateur Wethered. Then Kirkwood crossed the
Channel and finished third in the French champion-
ship to Boomer and Massy, but btat the veteran
Vardon, who was fourth. At St. Andrew’s .Joe’s,
score was 302 (Hutchison’s was 296) and at Le
Touquet. an easier course, 291. With the valuable
experience he has had he should be a 10 p.c. better
player next year. #
Eric Apperly and F. G. Murdoch had a
great tussle at Svdnev on Saturday for the Aus-
tralian Golf Club’s Hampden Cup. They were level
over 36 holes. A plav-off over 12 holes gave tne
lengthy Murdoch his first big victory since coming
to N. S. Wales.

Lyeett’s alleged unsportsmanlike behavior
in his match with Shimidzu at Wimbledon the other
day has aroused such criticism that the English
Lawn Tennis Assoc, is talking of dropping him
from the British team for the Davis Cup. Accord-
ing to the cabled description, Lycett took more rest
than tile rules allowed, thus giving him an unfair
advantage-over' the Jap, who was justly entitled to
win through superior stamina and speed. If Britain
sacks Lycett a complete withdrawal is not impro-
bable, seeing that the ex-Australian player is re-
garded as Britain’s main suit for the recovery of
the prize. With John Bull out, Australia’s chances
would be immensely improved, since Britain is to
be our next opponent should our colts defeat the
Canadians.
The battle for the r.*le of challenger in
the world's tennis championship at Wimbledon was
disastrous to the English players. The ex-Australian,
Lycett, practically collapsed in a sensational five-set
go with Shimidzu, and could only finish by being
sponged with champagne and water- —a most irregu-
lar proceeding. Kingscote, John Bull’s sole surviv-
ing hope, was then badly beaten by the Spaniard.
Manuel Alonzo, whose smashes and volleys demoral-
ised the Englishman. Alonzo, picked against Shimidzu
in the semi-finals, also captured the Jap’s scalp, biit
in the final fell to Brian Norton, the young S'African
champion. Norton is only 21. and showed his calibre
a while back by beating the veteran Raymond for
the championship of South Africa. Although
Tilden, last year's champion, recently underwent an
operation, and can hardly be at bis best, he allowed
the youngster to exercise his right, of challenge.
The result was a magnificent game, in which the
Yank lost the first two sets, took the third and fourth
comfortably, and was ail out in the last to win by
* * * *
Brian Norton, the S’African youth who
won the challenge round at Wimbledon the
other day, must have improved remarkably in his
game. Twelve months ago lie was not regarded as
equal to any of the colts whom Australia has just
sent after the Davis Cup. His service was weak, and
bis base-line play, to which he clung tenaciously,
should have made him a chopping-block for an expert
vollayer like Shimidzu. By good luck he didn’t meet
Shimidzu; still, putting aside bis match with
Tilden, when max' not have been thoroughly
fit, his triumph over Alonzo, who bad pre-
viously conquered the Jap. shows that be has
developed amazingly in pluck and skill. According
to the cable, Alonzo’s score was 7—5, o—4, 5—4,
with 30-love in the 10th game, which means that
he needed two points to win the match. Yet
Norton actually tore the third set out of the
Spaniard's grasp and romped home in the next two,
six games to the good. Truly an astonishing per-
formance.
A year ago S.A. Trotting Club was £5O
on the wrong side. It started electric-light meetings
and finished up the year about £BOO in hand. Now
it is looking for a permanent ground and the tote.
Wee Gun, Adelaide’s best stayer for many
years, has retired from the turf after winning
nearly £6OOO in stakes and landing an Adelaide and
a Birthday Cup. While in England owner John
Lewis, M.L.C., got Adrian Jones to paint him in
oils from a photograph, and the work may find a
nail in Adelaide’s Art Gallery. The nail will per-
haps he Australian even if the picture— painted from
a photograph—isn’t.
The squashing of the A.J.C. proposal to
absorb Moorefield and Warwick Farm is said to be
due to N. S. Wales pony influences. If that report
needs confirmation it will be found in the turn-over
of the pony clubs’ tote for the financial year ended
June 30. Including Victoria Park the machines
handled £1,104,877 compared with S 1,281,101 at
Randwick.
An odd comment on soccer football as now
played in Britain is found in the fact that of Scot-
land’s very best XI, chosen against England, six had
to be recalled from various English and Welsh towns
where they have professional engagements.

On Grand National Hurdle day at Flem-
ington the running was all for exquisite little
one-piece frocks muffled up with furs. Skirts
scarcely count, they are so short and so
narrow. The split is coming back into favor.
One smartly tailored nigger cloth was divided
at the back to well above the garter. Mrs.
Hiskens had three furs blended in one coat,
and a Manifold matron lined musquash with
mole —a double extravagance. Mrs. Geoff
Syme wore a narrow brown sheath with a
big brown hat. Mrs. Thompson had a tiny
turban rising out of a polar-bear coat of
white furs. Mrs. Gabb wore a look of de-
light at the South Australian win, and was
otherwise clad in a grey coat cut square and
an angular shiny black hat. Mrs. Leslie
Stuart, muffled in marmot, gave a big lun-
cheon party. Mrs. Leslie Macdonald’s skirt
Stopped near the knees, and she wore a
fur-flared cape like a native dress. Mrs.
Merson Cooper, who rejoiced in Tavistock’s
win, was neatly smoothed into navy tailor-
ings. The vice-regal pen was bleak and
empty all day. The only suggestion of Gov-
ernment House came from a couple of gent.-
Lelps who fluttered about the birdcage un-
officially.
Mrs. Leslie Stuart’s just-before-the-races
party in the magnificence of the Logan
House ballroom was a bright episode. There
was a hard, white frost without; but within
big wood fires blazed in all the reception-
rooms, and a Mary Ann was told off, vestal-
like, to tend each flame. There were quiet,
cosy rooms for the card fiends, and the scent
of mignonette was over all. Near the ball-
room conversation was carried on in shouts
because of the joyous blare of the jazz band
borrowed from the Narkunda. The boat had
to shriek its siren early on Saturday morn-
ing to recall its wandering-minstrel stewards.
The owners of several horses that raced on
Saturday were at the party—S’ Sam Hordern
with a marcel wave in his hair; Leslie Mac-
do,Sjtfld, overshadowed by his statuesque lady,
whd r jyas wrapped in a Cleopatra costume of
velvet; and Merson Cooper,
dappek? but distrait with ponderings on the
momny. ' : ? »
The dance belonged to the youngsters. The
two schoolgirl daughters of the house glowed
in, rose-pink taffeta and brilliant complexions,
aiid mamma spent the evening rooting young
men out of quiet corners and making them
dance. She was exquisitely gowned in black
lace over a sheath embroidered with wis-
taria. Mrs. Geoff Syme, in ermine and ivory,
brought a daughter brilliant in poppy-red.
Judge Williams looked boyish, and his wife
was a vision in pastel-tinted chiffons. Mrs.
Hodges was there with Gordon Chirnside
and Mrs. Chirnside, (he latter trailing an
aggravating little fish-tail of pink after
siiver-and-pink frills. She wore the nearest
approach to a peeress’s strawberry leaves in
diamonds. Half the jewels in Melbourne
were on view, and among them Mrs. Mac-
donald’s emerald earrings were like unto
railway signals. Mrs. Gibbs forswore gems
and wrapped herself in a short gown of
ci’ushed-mouse silk, and had her hair tied
up in a silk dust-cloth to match. A pedal
trouble put Dr. Pat Croombe among the
wallflowers. Two Bowes Kelly girls came in
gorgeous raiment, and Mrs. Staughton’s dress
looked like Carmen. A brace of aides got
off duty and blew in jovousl.v. Mrs. Cam-
eron, in pale primrose silk, brought a school-
boy son, and the Murray Mortons stole some
dances among the youngsters. Gertrude Dix
wore her best Prince frock. Beryl Fitz,
fresh from Melba, was turouoise green from
ha’r-band to shoe-buckle. Tommy Cochran’s
coiffure suggested the bob of a girl. Mad w e
Elb'ot came on from the theatre in pale curls
and pink taffeta, and the Balsillie meteor
streaked in nhout mhlnight. Host Leslie
Stuart, with British Arch and racing on his
mind, had to threaten to go and sleep at his
club before the party even thought of calling
its early-morning motor.
There was a pang of genuine regret at
the passing of Mrs. L. L. Smith. In other
days she was a bright and sparkling speck
at most official functions. Before the late
L.L. lost his seat for Mornington he was
the “Father” of the Assembly, and afterwards
as an Executive Councillor and chairman
of the Exhibition Trustees he still had an
official status and went through the annual
round of festivities, in which his wife and
daughter (Mrs. James Dyer) shared. When
the family gave up the old-fashioned man-
sion that had served as surgery and home
Mrs. Smith still preferred Collins-street to
the suburbs; and she was interested in
public affairs till the last. She lived long
enough to see her medical son make his
start in public life; he won a seat in the
City Council recently.
The Alfred Hospital means to do its
nurses well. The new building for them
will represent the completion of the scheme
started in 1908 when night-nurses’ quarters
were built on the Punt-road frontage of the
hospital. __ The Home will contain 109 bed-
rooms, 15 bathrooms, five pantries, four
large sitting-rooms, a writing-room, a room
where nurses can see visitors privately, an
office, five linen-rooms, and three box-rooms
—all of which has an ample sound about it.
The foundation-stone of the new quarters
is to be laid on July 8, and the whole job is
expected to be finished five months hence.
The symbolic white bridal chiffonery is
nowadays sniffed at bv girls who yearn for
showy effect. The famous beauty, Lady
Diana (Manners) Cooper, who has a fierce
passion for the limelight, defied supersti-
tion and convention by binding her golden
head in a chaplet of green leaves, whereat
other brides rapturously heaped green-stuff
upon themselves, with less happy effect.
Sporty Heather Keep has now pioneered the
verdant touch in this city. She hid her
blushes under a lace veil girded with some-
thing that looked like a victor’s laurels, and
didn’t altogether fit with the fussy bridal
draperies below.
So many disrespectful jokes are made
about Walter Kirby in private that it seems
only a fair thing for the: mellifluous tenor to
get some public honor paid him off the con-
cert platform. In recognition of services
willingly rendered he has been made a life
governor of the Alfred Hospital and the
Blind Institute. Lots of singers are open to
earn the same recognition, but they are not
Kirbys. There is but one Walter, and at
his best he is the sweetest thing in song
that’s going.
Great preparations are in hand for the
marriage of Senator Pearce’s daughter
Dorothy and Lieut. 11. B. Ellison (19th
Light Horse) on July 14. The ceremony
will be at the Methodist Church in Fitzroy-
street, St. Ivilda, and there will be big eating
at Carlyon’s afterwards.
Our Earl was installed as a Digger at the
conference of the sub-branches of the Yic.
R.S.S.I.L.A. last week, and was reipinded
that he would have to ante up 10s. a year to
the nearest (Malvern) sub-branch. The
Countess, who was with his Ex., used to
nurse battered Billjims at Henham Hall, her
home in the Cold, and she got a big welcome.
Her laughing remark that she didn’t talk in
public in the presence of her husband, but
waited till she got him home, won large
grins. Some of them seemed to have met
that sort of wife themselves.
Connoisseurs of black-and-white are
always arrested by Christian Yandell’s little
panel at the Vic. Artists’ exhibitions. For
some years she has contributed a set of
highly imaginative drawings, distinguished
by a graceful pen-
line and a Vierge-like
skill in the use of
blacks. Collectors
have naturally
pounced upon her
best works, and au-
thors requiring an
unconventional illus-
trator have never re-
gretted giving her a
job. Recently she
produced several re-
markable drawings
for a story in verse,
entitled “Renegades,”
by Rupert Atkinson,
and the poet was so
impressed that he en-
gaged her to provide
pictures for a play
which is to be issued by a Melbourne pub-
lisher. The young designer, who is here
photoed by Monteath, is the wife of Napier
Waller, a soldier-artist who, having lost his
right arm, is painting brilliantly with his
left.
As Walter Manifold, president of the
Uppah Chambah, is still in mourning for
his wife, it was arranged that the At Home
after the opening of the State session should,
be given by Speaker Mackey and his lady
—her first Parliamentary social function as
hostess since the knighthood came in
January.
Mary Travers, a popular Toorak girl, is
now linked on the engaged-list with a well-
liked locai bachelor, Jack Derham.
Cynics are smiling at the manner in which
the difficulty regarding the Rev. Cyril Bar-
clay, champion of High Church principles, has
been settled. Canon Hughes, the impreg-
nable High Church vicar of St. Peter’s,
Eastern Hill, has made Barclay a curate, and
he will leave the parish of St. John and St.
James, a few' blocks further west. Hughes
has invited the High Church folk beyond
Swanston-street to come over to St. Peter’s
and worship in the way that is pleasing
to them, and he has launched a project for
raising a trifle of £lO,OOO to put up a new
church and mission-house for Barclay. If
any Anglican Goliath wants to hit Jonathan
now he will have to tackle the David of St.
Peter’s first.
Mac Alister Smith, returned Digger, who
has come under more than one beam of spot-
light, has, on the
word of a Kirby, a
chance of a career as
a pianist; but his
craving is for poli-
tics. He has already
made one try to
break into the
House, having
opposed McPherson
in the last sprint for
the Hawthorn seat.
The politically in-
clined Digger, who is
a son of the late
Crombie Smith, is in
his early twenties,
and looks like a
youth of 18. He is
vice-president of the
R.S.A. of Hawthorn
and president of half-a-dozen sports associa-
tions. In musical circles he is known as the
possessor of “piano hands,” and a fine bass-
baritOne voice. He was badly knocked about
in the war. Part of his lower jaw was shot
away, but the wizardry of modern Surgery has
replaced the bone with silver, and Smith’s
study of elocution and enunciation has over-
come the drawback thereby entailed, lie
can now speech with orator-force, and his
singing voice is practically unimpaired.
Shier took the accompanying photo, of the
silver-jawed young man.
Colin Colahan, who gave an exhibition of
his paintings last week, is off to Spain before
very long. He may have company, too.
Cheery Tom Hogan will be a missed figure
at many functions, but most particularly will
his passing be noticed at Flemington. Rivers
of genuine sympathy are streaming to hand-
some Mrs. Tom. More devoted lovers never
lived in this city than the Hogan pair.
H. Septimus Power gathered a trunkful
of cash from his recent exhibition at the
Vic. Artists’ galleries. In addition to sell-
ing four pictures to the Australian War
Museum, he disposed of “Cavalry Charge at
Cambrai” and a study of mounted Anzacs
to the National Gallery, the former through
the Felton Bequest.
The Paterson girls and their comely
mamma have captured a flat in Bedford-
square, London, only a few minutes away
from cousin Louis Esson. Betty has already
found employment for her restless fingers
in two generous commissions from Raphael
Tuck.
Alice Creswiek, sister of A.T.C., master
of the Melbourne Hunt Club, is letting the
family mansion in Haw-llawthorn and going
to live in Italy. Mrs. Talbot Hamilton will
accompany her; also grand-niece Barbara—
an athletic girl this, who can easily jump her
own height. The guidebooks say that Italy
is remarkable for its springs. Perhaps that's
the attraction for her.
Rudolf Ilimmer, one-time fashionable
voice culturist, went to his Valhalla last
week. Arriving in Australia in 1885 he
toured with the Hungarian Remenyi; and
at the Alexandra Theatre (Her Majesty’s)
in 1887 lie, with Ernest Hartung, Martin
Schmidt and Elise Wiedermann-Pinschof,
operated for charity in Lortzing’s “Czar and
Zimmermann,” a Peter-the-Great opera. In
the days when social edicts went out from
the German Club and the Vienna Cafe and
other eating houses, Ilimmer was a social
lion. The war left him marooned.
The Merson Coopers in their jaunt over
the Continent came into contact with the
family of Tony Panaaker, the curly-haired
youth of mystery who came from “Yotter-
dam” and caused a sensation here during
the war. The travellers use asterisks and
exclamation-marks when they describe the
magnificence of the Panaaker family.
The tariff that cut out the Fiji banana
will be something of a boon to the moneyed
seekers after winter warmth. The A.U.S.N.
steamer Levuka, hitherto of the Fiji banana
service, is to tour between Melbourne and
Cairns, laden with first-saloon passengers and
extra accommodation. She casts off on her
first trip on July 9.
After having helped to educate two or
three generations of boys at Christian
Brothers schools, Bro. J. B. Lynch slipped
into Shadowland a few days ago. As a
youth of 20 he landed in Melbourne in 1858,
and he did his chief work at the bluestone
college in Victoria-parade. Forced by
blindness into comparative inactivity in the
last few years, he went into retirement at
St. Vincent de Paul’s Orphanage, South Mel-
bourne —an institution which at one period
he directed.
The Women’s Hospital committee has
fallen to bickering again, and the medical
staff is saying things under its breath that
it wouldn’t mention out loud, for worlds,
before ladies.
Lady Randolph Churchill, whose death was
reported a few days ago, took as her second
husband a Cornwallis West, who was two
years younger than her own son. Her
third, Mr. Porch, whom she married in 1918,
was 41 and Commissioner for Nigeria.
Although the lady was over 60 when she
made the last addition to her matrimonial
facade, she didn’t do it on the quiet in a
sober tailor-made. Those who saw’ the wed-
ding have a vivid recollection of her lovely
tango shoes coming down the steps of St.
George’s, Hanover Square. Next night sne
w r as in a box at a theatre, with coroneted
brows callimr on her in the interval. One
wonderful thing about it all was that, if
Winston ever disapproved of his ma’s marrv-
iugs, he always seemed in public as though he
couldn’t have wished her to do anything else.
Before her first marriage she was an Ameri-
can, the beautiful Jennie Jerome. Her hus-
band. the brilliant Randolph, was a younger
son of the Duke of Marlborough.
A nice fat cheque will flutter into the St.
Martin’s Boys’ Home in consequence of Miss
Nyulasy’s cheery musical afternoon frivol,
which cost ss. a head. Those who warbled
for the cause were Mrs. Reynolds (Maggie
Jervis), Mrs. Fan Dango Mackay, Mr. Col-
lins and Sidney Mannering. During the
proceedings the Allen lady spoke a piece
about the cause with good effect.
Adelaide drops a line: —
The postponement of their Federal Exes.’ visit
from the Saturday till Tuesday caused a general
juggling of the social fixtures. They only had time
to lunch on the day of their arrival before they were
rushed off to the Osborne Hall, where the Victoria
Hospitality League was holding n reception in
their honor. In the evening, at the first Mayoral
ball, there was a big rally of fathers and mothers,
and the usual Noah’s Ark procession did two long,
long trails past the dais to shake first the Mayoral
and then the vice-regal hand. It seemed a pity
the good old Lancers were not revived for the
middle-aged; as it was most of them huddled to-
gether on the outskirts of the room, like dejected
poultry, so few knew anything about the new steps.
At one time there was only a good-looking naval
man and his partner pluckily footing it
before an admiring crowd of 700-odd. There was
nothing startling in the frocking. Mum mostly
wore a little fish train, which she let down just
before she was received, and pa trod on it, and
said “Damh!”
The Girl Guides made early birds. They were on
the eastern lawn at Government House two hours
after the arrival of their Exes, on the Tuesday morn-
ing. Tlure were five companies of guides and 16
officers. Lady Forster and our Governor’s wife in-
spected the damsels, and the former had a few words
with them.
On the Wednesday night the second Mayoral ball
vas held. Their Exes, were again present, and there
was some more march-past. The age-limit was
lower, and there were no wallflowers this time.
Skirts have not come down with the prices ; some-
even fluttered above the knee. But the bodices still
showed a distinct southward tendency. One woman,
who entrusted too much responsibility to a string of
beads, retired from the scene of action early in the
evening. Generally speaking, what there was of the
frocking was colored; and, anyhow, it was a scene
of domestic felicity, husbands and wives all jazzing
together so sweetly.
The following night saw a children’s ball and a
reception at Government House, the latter quite
interesting. When the- crowd had assembled the
G.-G. got busy with decorations. George Brookman
had a ribbon tied round his neck, a star pinned on
his chest, and,was twice smitten with ironmongery;
then the G.-G. said, “Rise, Sir George!” and George
rose looking no different. After this came nine
0.8.E.’s and one M.C. With regard to the women,
his Ex. had a nerve-wracking job; :i’s one thing to
attach a ribbon to a man’s coat, but to pin a medal
to a bit of ninon ! Fox-trotting and supper in
a huge marquee followed.
An old Adelaide resident passed out recently in
the person of Mrs. Simpson, widow of the late A. M.
Simpson and daughter of the late Dr. John Sheridan,
formerly editor of the London Morning Advertiser.
She took a keen interest in all charitable works, and
a while ago established the Aviation Library at the
’Varsity in memory of her late husband.
Our Supreme Court has been discussing woman’s
truthfulness. Proceeding from what he says is the
admitted fact that she does not make so “reliable”
a witness as man, Villfeneuve Smith, K.C., remarked:
“There is something in the nature of women, it
seems, which prevents their realising to the fullest
degree the nature of Truth. Perhaps this partly
explains the secret of feminine charm.” But he
won’t give us credit for pre-eminence even as fibbers.
“A distinguished civil engineer,” he said, “drew
the distinction between the degrees of liars: liars,
d—d liars and expert witnesses; and then there is
my brother George.” But perhaps that distinguished
civil engineer didn’t have any sisters.
E. V. Day, the Adelaide head of Dalgetv’s since
Van Senden’s death, has received a strong- hint from
Lis doctor, and is retiring to his vineyard. An
illness far more serious is that of Ainslie Caterer,
second master of ‘ St. Peter’s School for 30 years
under Girdlestone and Bickersteth, and acting-head
during the long interregnum between them.

ALL AUSTRALIA USES
REXONA.
NeVer a day passes but that Rexona scores another
triumph over those serious troubles of life—Scalds, Burns,
Sores, Pimples, Blotches, Nasal Catarrh and Rheumatism.
The dainty little triangular pot of Rexona, the Rapid Healer,
contains a combination of the most curative, antiseptic, sooth-
ing and healing properties known to science.
Rexona is the Skin Remedy of the Age, because it
destroys the harmful germs that may be present in a sore,
pimple or any abrasion of the skin, thus preventing any
contagion of the blood and at the same time causes a
new, healthy skin to grow.
Rexona immediately reduces the inflammation and pain;
it acts as a distinct stimulant to the pores of the skin, and sets
up a healing action immediately that increases day by day.
To obtain skin perfection use Rexona Soap daily and
Rexona the Rapid Healer on any skin affection. Get
the Rexona Habit; it means Health and Beauty.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Holeprol
Hoslery
Little Mrs. Ellis Rowan, looking ethereal
in her soft black lace frock and feathcr-
wreathed black hat, received the homage of
Woman at the Australia one afternoon last
week, when the presidents of the Uni.
Women Graduates’ Association, the Women’s
Reform League, the Feminist Club, the
Public School Teachers’ Federation and
various other women’s bodies nearly a column
long gathered round her to express their
ardent desire that Australia should become
possessed of the Rowan collection. Every-
body who lays claim to a brow higher than
the ordinary attended the drawing-room, and
all the talk was of bird and beetle and
flower. Mrs. Rowan herself took away an
armful of blooms, for each association had
thrust a streamer-hung bouquet upon her.
Miss Preston-Stanley, the McMillan lady
and musical Joe Bradley’s small wife were
among the speakers; and among the enthusi-
astic listeners were Mrs. Sydney Hei'ring,
Dr. Kate Knowles, Dr. Mary Booth, Theo
Cowan and Miss Macarthur Onslow.
Captain Waldo Evuns, of the U.S.A. Navy,
Administrator of Pago Pago (he is called
Governor on the island), has paid Sydney a
Hying visit. With him came his good-look-
ing American wife, whose Christian name,
Parepa Rosa, hu.s a smack of the Pacific
Islands about it. Mrs. Evans describes Pago
as a little paradise built round a lagoon,
“deep and large enough to hold the Navy of
America.” The population consists of
natives and 45 American families, and the
latter all grow their own vegetables; but
there is a dearth of flowers, except hibiscus
and roses. Mrs. Evans took back with her
a gift for the wife of the ruling native —a
suede bag with colored embroideries, the
nearest thing she could find to the “pocket-
book on a long chain hanging from the neck”
that the soft-eyed Polynesian lady longed
for. There was a curious coincidence the
night the Waldo Evanses dined at the Went-
worth. Next to their table, which was
decorated with American flags, was a table
that bloomed with Union Jacks and the
Southern Cross; and its diners were of the
Australian Navy. Maybe it was the coming
event that cast its shadow before —the navies
of the two Pacific nations side by side!
Mrs. Nelson gave the Waldo Evans couple
a good-bye party in the Australia, and the
American visitors were delighted when Nellie
Stewart and artist George Lambert, whom
they knew by reputation, brought parties to
anchor at close range. Mrs. Edmund Play-
fair and Mrs. Henty were two good-lookers
at the tea drinking.
The American Consular Nortons are not
leaving Sydney for another two months. The
Consul’s successor has been delayed by sick-
ness, and the popular couple are living half
in and half out of their trunks at their flat
at St. Ronan’s. An interesting bit of the
Consulate work is among the veterans of the
Civil War. There are still 45 of the “boys”
in Sydney, a little bit querulous, sometimes,
but, unless they are settled in comfort, looked
after by the Consulate as though they were
its babies. Thev draw pensions running up
from 30 dollars a month ; they are supplied
with reading matter, and, if need be, an eye
is kept on their lodgings; and if one of them
wants, as one did a month or so ago, to pass
his remaining days “under the flag,” he is
shown the photographs of the different
veterans’ homes in the U.S.A., and told all
the advantages each possesses. Then when
he makes his choice fit is generally a matter
of the number of “boys” of his old unit in
the home that decides him), the Consulate
books the old soldier’s passage, and he goes
back to be an honored guest of Uncle Sam
till the call comes for him to indeed lie
under the flag.
One of the best-looking couples Canon
Charlton has ever blessed into bondage stood
before him one evening last week at St.
Andrew’s when Viva Brock became Mrs.
Edward Hindmarsh Dodds. Viva made the
transfer of her dark slimness in pale-pink
taffeta and old family lace, and was sup-
ported by what seemed, looking from the dis-
tance up the long aisle, a daffodil of early
Spring, but was really bridesmaid Dome
Litchfield in pale-yellow taffeta and a gold
lilee hat. Captain Clive Fitzhardinge. M.C.,
was best man. The bridegroom’s genial dad
and Mrs. Leonard spread the after-junketing
at the Waratah, and, first-mated by daughter
Mrs. Metcalfe Jackson, piloted the wedding
breakfast far from the frequent rocks of
boredom on to the seas of high enjoyment.
Canon Charlton proposed the bride’s health ;
“Hop” proposed the bridegroom’s parents,
and Monty Somer and Dr. George Bell
were also heard from. Bride’s father
and intimate friends of both clans were
part of the jolly gathering. Bride-
groom, who belonged to the Air Force,
started his soldiering in East Africa. After
helping to clean up that little mess he went
to Bombay, and thence to Egypt, where he
came out of his flying exams, among the
head-liners. From then on he did a sort of
round trip, crossed over Arabia and finally
came to earth at Salonika. Viva’s dad in the
years back dreamed of making Narrabeen the
Palm Beach of N. S. Wales. It was he who
had the playing fields laid out there —even
polo was arranged for. As happens so often
the vision came too soon, and the playing
fields of Narrabeen never yielded a decent
box-oflice return to their original owner.
The Bundoek-Jopp wedding at St. James’s
recently united families that were neighbors
’way up on the Clarence and Richmond over
half a century ago. The late Wellington
Cochrane Bundock, grandfather of the just-
married Lieut.-Colonel Bundock, squatted at
Wyandarie, on the Richmond. On the banks
of the Clarence, at Tabulam, dwelt the late
Major Chauvel, father of Harry, whose wife
and the newly-wed Mrs. Bundock are sisters.
Higher mp the Clarence lived the late E. D.
Ogilvie—brother of the late Mrs. W. C. Bun-
dock—owner of a magnificent stretch of sta-
tion property, Yugilbar, with its castle stand-
ing almost on the river bank.
Julian Ashton, who is a sick man these
days, is feeling all the better for making
the effort to attend the dinner the Society
of Artists gave George Lambert. The guest
prepared the notes for his speech all through
the meal —everybody’s menu was requisi-
tioned, and the cards were spread out in an
artistic design before' the throbbing red
beard of the newly-returned brother. When
he rose to make the speech he immediately
lost track of the notes, and for the life of
him couldn’t find the ornate peroration
Hardy Wilson had written out for him.
However, one thing he didn’t need to make
a note about was his indebtedness to Julian
Ashton, who was his only teacher before the
scholarship (which burst in its second year)
sent him to Europe. And that’s a re-
markable thing—the only travelling art
scholarship N. S. Wales has ever presented
failed to materialise for more than one year.
What George Lambert’s feelings were when
the second year’s remittance didn’t arrive
can be left to the imagination, .lohn Long-
staff was among the listeners, and also
Dennis Allen; and what that rubber-tyred
young man thought of facing the world on
a scholarship of £l5O a year didn’t transpire.
The Lambert dinner will, by the way, pro-
bably be the last feast spread before Ilardv
Wilson before that tall person (he’s tall
and thin, enough to be a Chesterton hero)
goes off to China.
Here’s Lelia Coppola, who played Mistress
Millament in Congreve’s “Way of the
World,” Which the S.U.D.S. put on at the
Repertory a week or two ago, to the aston-
ished and delighted bit of Sydney that
managed to squeeze
into the theatre on
Church Hill. Lelia
is a born comedy-
actress, and in-
vested the brilliant
belle of more than
200 years ago with
a magnetism that
made one realise why
bride-snatching was
a favorite sport
among gentlemen of
the road. In addi-
tion to learning her
lines for the last
production she read
up everything she
could find of Con-
greve and his circle,
m ore particularly
that which related to Anne Bracegirdle, for
whom the part was created. Anne, as you
will remember, was the first woman on record
to receive a prize for virtue. Eight hundred
guineas were subscribed for the lady, and the
list was headed by Lord Halifax. The
beauteous, virtuous and gifted Anne now lies
in Westminster Abbey, but Lelia Coppola is
a very-much-alive North Shore liner with
youth and brains, a B.A. degree and good
looks to help in the make-up of one of the
best amateurs the Sydney stage has known.
Alexander Watson, tall and dress-suited,
stood against a background of old-rose
curtains in the King’s Hall on Satur-
day night and transplanted his listeners into
the market-place of Rome just after Julius
Ca*sar hud stopped the several daggers of
envy the other aldermen had plunged into
him. With a word or two he had you among
the excited, turbulent crowd. You saw them
sway at Brutus’s speech; and you were
among the seething, stormy mob unleashed
by the cunning of Mark Antony. After that
the excursiqnist took you not so successfully
(and that was the authors’ fault) out with
a trawler on the North Sea, and placed you
with a hard-pressed company at Loos to
watch the famous charge of the Guards.
Next you were in the India of Kipling’s
Tommy calling for Gunga Dhin and the old
romance of Mandalay. And then suddenly
you smelled the boronia and the young gum-
leaves. and you knew that Souter’s “Emily
Smith” was the only girl in South Australia.
Charley Bryant, the artist who returns
to the scenes of his youth, thinks the only
thing wanting now in Sydney is a Bohemian
Club. He would like to see something
established like the London Sketch Club,
where the artists foregather to paint a given
subject between six and eight, then sit down
to beef and bread and beer, with a smoke-
concert to follow —and get home what hour
you like.
Whether to conserve the State Orchestra
or let it moulder in the bud, that is the
question which is ex-
citing musical Syd-
ney. On Saturday
night, in the interval
of the Ileifetz-
Orchestra concert,
Mrs. T. 11. Kelly
(May Moore’s pic-
ture of the lady is
alongside) mounted
the stage to appeal
to the assembled
multitude to buy up
shares in the guaran-
tee co., and so keep
the orchestra with
us. Dame Margaret
(to whom Mrs. Ber-
tie bobbed as though
she were the tenant
of the hail farm and
the Dame the squiress about to renew the
lease) was on the carpet and turned an
approving ear ; and the rest of the audience
was mostly busy dissecting the speaker’s
outfit. Mrs. Bertie made a good speech, and
incidentally asked whether we are always to
be forced to send our children abroad in
search of culture. Mrs. Bertie has just
returned from placing her boy at Eton.
Mrs. Kelly made her appeal for the orches-
tra in a dress composed of wide strips of
exquisite floral ribbon, with silk lace draped
from the shoulders and drawn together and
fastened in front with a diamond and emerald
ornament; the skirt continued the lace drap-
ing.s, and somewhere in the latitude of the
knee these were clutched by another dia-
mond and emerald ornament. A head-dress
in pink—something between a turban and
a Hussar’s busby—was covered with sequins
and carried a chin-strap of rings covered
with floral silk. In addition there were
gold strap shoes and a white shimmering
cape collared and bordered with deep bands
of dark fur.
The price of an extra bursary or two was
added to St. Joseph’s funds by the ball of
the Old Boys’ Union at Paddington one night
last week. The colors of the school, cerise
and blue, in addition to festoons of pretty
girls, were everywhere in the decoration of
the hall. Other R.C.. colleges officially re-
presented were Rivevview, St. Aloysios, St.
John’s and the Christian Brothers. The big
Town Hall was crowded, and treasurer W.
McEwen looked the happiest young man
present.
Word has come home about Madge Tither-
ndge’s Desdemona in London. Really a nut-
brown beauty, she hates the golden plaits,
hut is compensated by the wonderful nightie
in which she slips into the beyond. It is
a ravishing affair that, would induce a Frank
Morton sonnet. Margot Asquith, of the in-
discreet memoirs, wrote a letter of congratu-
lation on Madge’s performance, and very
sweetly sent it to Mrs. Titheradge, who,
though much better, is still an inmate of a
London nursing home.
Ken Duffield, the J3outh Australian, and
Dion Titheradge continue their collabora-
tion. The latest is a spasm called “Puss,
Puss,” written for Lee White and Clay
Smith, and now running at the Vaudeville
Theatre. Incidentally, Mr. Duffield’s first
song was introduced to London by Madge
Titheradge.
Mary Forrest, the Queensland poetess, has
written a playlet, and her friends (or a few
of them) have seen it performed. Partici-
pants in the deed included two members of
the Town Topics Company, Dulcie Crane and
Carl Formes. The little thing is named
“The Highwayman” and has the two ingredi-
ents of poetry and fun. It had an enthusi-
astic first reception. Formes, who is the
highwayman, includes in his- wooing a song
that the versatile Mary has written and that
other good Bananalander Whaite has sot to
alluring music.
Last week still another soldiers’ memorial
was unveiled —this time at the Teachers’
College by the Cullen lady. It took the
form of a painting of a Rouen landscape by
Australian artist Arthur Streeton. The
memorial has been paid for by direct contri-
butions from girl teachers, ex-students from
all parts of N. S. Wales and its dependency,
Norfolk Island. The women members of the
staff have also made liberal contributions, for
they felt perhaps even more than the students
the loss of promising young lives.
If you live in Elizabeth Bay or the ’Loo or
Potts Point, you’ll remember waking in the
cold grey dawn to the sound of bands playing
“Tipperary” and “Boys of the Dardanelles,”
and you realised with a lump in your throat
that more of the boys were marching down to
the gates of Woolloomooloo Wharf, where yet
another transport waited to load up with
khaki-elad figures. Since the first Anzac Dav
these gates have been hung with wreaths on
every anniversary, mothers and wives mak-
ing the early pilgrimage to honor the spot
where they last saw their men. Now there's
to be a lasting memorial in the shape of a
fountain at the gates: the Archbishop of Syd-
ney has blessed the site, and the G.-G. and
the State Exes, have given vice-regal appro-
val. The Soldiers’ Club Mil be pleased to
receive any contribution you may have for
the Fountain Fund. But those gates shall
still wear their wreaths. Let’s see to that.
The undergraduates held their ball in the
Town Hall on Friday night amidst a blaze
of royal blue and gold, for the Uni. colors
were everywhere, decorating the base of the
platform and floating in banners from the
gallery. Nearly 500 young things danced
beneath the yellow-shaded lights under the
official chaperonage of Mrs. Barff and Miss
Isabel Sidler, president of the Women’s
University Union.
Annette Kellerman entertained old friends
and relations at Bayard, Point Piper, one day
last week. The kiddies, who were legion and
of all ages, were piloted around the harbor
in the afternoon by the Heifetz sisters, who
became great favorites with the youngsters.
After tea the evening was devoted to jazzing
and games; and Annette and her husband had
to beg for a couple of hours off to attend a
dinner given them by the Gallery Girls.
Among their guests were the Frank Alberts,
the Hugh Wards (mother and boys Mel and
Hugh), Fanny Durack and Mesdames Keller-
man, Evans, Wood, Croft, Mclntyre, Luke
and Ilellmrich. The infants, after being
petted, were presented with large boxes of
chocolates, and went off believing all the
beautiful fairy stories they had been regaled
with earlier in the day. A wonderful hostess
is Annette.
Here’s a Somerset Maugham summary of
ex-President Wilson (Maugham has a slight
tendency to stutter, so you can imagine the
little business he makes of the av’s and s’s) :
"W-Wilson w-was too young to f-fight in
the C-c-civil W-war. He w-was s-still too
y-young to f-fight in the Sp-panish-A-meri-
can War. He w-was t-too proud to f-fight in
the G-great War, But he w-was ‘O-oh
B-boy !’ in the B-boudoir !”
Being a woman, too, you’ve had something
to say on the matter of press-studs'; and if
you are a perfect lady you chose a secluded
spot to disburden your mind. We’ve all had
the experience of the summer dress back
from the laundry that sprang open from
collar to waist when there came the slightest
tug on the skirt; or you’ve had the agonising
experience of the winter one-piece that sud-
denly gaped here and there because the stud
didn’t click properly. Now one of the
heads (female) of the Ited Cross is
trying to make press-studs a feature
of the V.A. uniform; a new cap,
under discussion, instead of being a nice
straight piece of lawn or linen that can be
put down flat on the ironing-board and laun-
dered in a jiffy, is to be a rounded thing
gathered into a band, which means three
times the ironing; and the apron is to have
cumbersome gathers at the waist. General
Roth, who addressed the V.A.’s the other
night, doesn’t know the wigging he (scaped
owing to the uniform question being shelved.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Miss Fewings, the founder of the Brisbane High
School for Girls, was given a warm welcome on her
return to Brisbane last week, after an absence of IS
years in England. There was a flock of her old
girls on the wharf to meet; her.
The Thomas Robinson dame entertained the
V.A.D.’s on Friday afternoon at Mrs. Ross Monro's
home at Indooroopillv. Martha Burns introduced
the girls, who jazzed and chased tennis balls and
received their V.A. certificates.
Little Mona Norwood Brown was sufficiently re-
covered to be wedded to her soldier, Captain Dyson,
on Friday, afternoon. But it had to be very quiet,
only- the lady’s parents and her grandmother, Mrs,
Condon Sydney, being present, with Melody Taylor
as bridesmaid and J. 11. Hunter, M.C., as best man.
The Press Institute entertained the Thomas Robin-
sons at a dinner one night during the week. Sculptor
Harold Parker (and his wife), Dora Meeson, the T.
J. Ryans and ttie Mayor and Mayoress of Brisbane
were among the guests.
In its short nine years the Wattle Day League has
founded the Daphne Mayo Scholarship Fund, built
a recreation hall for .soldiers at Kangaroo Point, and
provided the Rosemount Hospital with the finest
orthopedic ward in Australia. Last year the Bursary
Fund for soldiers’ and sailors’ children was given
a helping hand, and this year the receipts will go
towards furthering Miss Mayo’s studies, and to assist
the Social Sendee Institute.
At a recent Brisbane exam, the bright child,
asked to explain the terms B.C. and V.A.D., replied
that one stood for “Basin Crop” and the other for
the “Venerable Archbishop Duhig.”

Gumleaf: You can’t make us believe it
about that sort of girl... .Tarago: A variant of a
more picturesque yarn often told in print about
the dearest of old French priests in Sydney....
A.A.8.: But nine-tenths of The Bulletin's readers
don’t know what that paper said, and therefore are
not a bit interested.... Timo: “Milk Jug” is a hit
crude Dealers: None of them up E.G. (Ash-
field) : It’s as bad as the handwriting R.K.McA.:
No good C.K. (Neutral Bay): Follows a well-
marked course... .0.W.5.: No use to u 5.... J.K.8..
It's gone. . . .C.8.A.: As uneven as the hag of bananas
the Dago sells you when you’re not looking W.:
Must go back J.McK.: How on earth can you
get the “rhythm” of a writer in translation t 7ou
might as well talk about getting the color of a
violet from a bottle of scent... .John S.: It’s a
jumpy little fragment. .. .0.11. G.: Barbara is on the
long trail home L.S.C.: Nothing in it....W.5.
(Auckland): Pizarro is far too crude... .11.M.R.:
None of them get near... .Meataxe: Sorry... .Ginger
Mick: l>n the contrary, he’s an examiner... . J.ll .S.:
Not well enough done Norman C.: You have
some idea; but you must make it more direct.
Those conversations ate a ridiculous jumble
E.M.S.: Thanks; but we could hardly publish that.
C.S.W.: It goes rather sadly till the last line
is reached; then it puts on a spurt and chases the
rhyme right to the last hurdle G.G.D.: Written
(wasn’t it?) with a l'eucing-post dipped in plum
juice. Sorry it is otherwise not interesting. ...
The Poet: Guess again.... Nancy II.: Can’t oiler
private criticism... .Alandale: Not enough in the
verses W.E.L.: Your “Echo” has become inco-
herent in transit... .F.E.8.: Well told, but too melo-
dramatic R.S.H.: Yes, the lines jumped to the
basket Ken F.: Yarn doesn’t make good I 11.
(Fremantle) :No use... .Palmat: We’re far too polite
to tell you what the verse is really like Rex B.:
One has a sporting chance... .L.E.11.: None of them
get near C.L.G.: “Out of Control” must go back.
F K.S.: Won't d0....Kem0: Poor verse....
Queeuie P.: Yarn fails.... Harry II.: Not much of
a yarn in creaky verse.. . .L.8.C.: Nicely written.
Try us with something different... .M.M.: “Rain
misses The Shadow: No use Francis 1).: Not
well enough done. .. .R.L.J.: Ditto... .M.G. (Bendi-
go): Read closely; find out what verse really i 5....
Sne.vd It.: Not well enough done Mildred
“Harvesting Song” doesn’t sing much. See if you
can’t make? it catch more of the spirit of the thing.
... .Arthur R.: “Christmas Bells” is too thin. The
theme has been worked over and over again....
E.A.E. : An idea, hut so far not well enough handled.
....George P. f Too lumpy... .Viator: That sort of
thing is useless. .. .F.H.F.: Poor stuff. .. . A.J.D..
No good Violet C.: Why not try to say something
of your very own? An echo is such an unsatisfying
thing Bent Stem: Nothing in “Silas” J.S.
(Perth): No freshness about it... .Nightmare: lies
~ very naughty boy; and you said “Blanky blank !
Fie fie !. .. . j.T. (Corowa) : Very bad A.M.8.:
Nothing in them.. . .N.H.: (Dalb.v): Doesn’t make
much of a yarn J.H.A.: Nothing usable... .Bat:
So the terrible young lady went on knitting in spite
of the fact that you thought her rude? The epic
subject is too big....R.E: No use heie. Ihe>
belong to a solemn class of humor very hard on
the average teetotaller.... Hautboy: “Maritana
doesn’t hang together M.8.P.: “Winter Love'
misses by a little... .G.R.M.: Not what we hanker
after F.M.C.: Not improved J.0.M.: Just the
old commonplaces.... Just a Woman: Not enough
interest J.J.H. : Better grow up first and then
write about something you know in a way nobody
has ever written before. It’s a long road, but it’s
the only one Madeleine B.: Verses miss; don’t
care for the story... .W.T.P.: A rambling'account
of an ordinary journey to well-known places. No
more interesting than a catalogue of drapery
R.M. (Dalby) : Gets near, but you can’t rhyme
“universe” with “reverse.”... .Gipsy E.: Not well
enough done Alf P.: Read some decent verse
and try to get the hang of things Joseph 1..: So
* rugged that we wore out a pair of boots and an
alpenstock on it Sardonyx: Yarn doesn’t strike
us Douglas C.: Not up F.A.H.: Very thin
and so tired Paul M.: Neither of them scores
Riverside: May the Lord mend your sense of humor!
. ...R.L.J.: Repeats old commonplaces in unattrac-
tive verse. .F.McN.: Couldn’t be much worse. You
say the form is “true” ; but it slops out at the
third line C.T.K.: Haven’t the faintest idea what
it means. .. .Norman W.: Very lame... .C.M.W.:
No use Mr. Mac: Your “Prodigal” is a dull per-
son .... Ken Kurrajong: Doesn’t get near.... Chas.
Ml: No “Deck Chair” was ever as wordy as that. .. .
HiG.L.B.: Note your contention that removal of
the Protective duties on farm machinery, leaving
the Australian manufacturer wholly at the dumper'
mercy, would “help to absorb the unemployed.” (Next
time it rains we will go out without an umbrella
and see if that keeps our coat dry) Twemlow:
The Bulletin declines to be drawn into an inter-
minable argument about Mannix. Its views are on
record; make the best (or the worst) of them
K.M.: “Lamb” isn’t very interesting. .. .Ebsworth :
If you feel like that about her in July, what will
it be in the Spring!... .P.R.S.: If you can get it
at all you’ll have to pay 7 or 8 per cent, for it.
And don’t curse the State banks. You’d certainly
have to pay much more but for them. In Maori-
land’s strenuous days a few mortgages went to
12* per cent C.L.G.: Old Bulletin divorce yarn.
. Maori ginalNot original : little point in clip-
ping H.G.L.8.: Not enough interest H.A.H.:
Deaf yarn has an ancient flavor G.S.: What
book are you quoting?... .0.5. H.: Those figures
l.ave been printed before. .. .D. 5.8.: Already covered.
. ...H.P.: So many second-hand that all come under
suspicion R.G.P.: Don’t mind in the least; but
these not. up.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.

age....5.W.: The worst of the week....J. MeC.:
Your female figures commend your innocence, but
i.ot your art... .C.G.: Misses... .I.B.: That drunk
drawing is drunker than you think.,. . T.L.W.: A
bad miss C. 8.: Nothing in it J.W.1.: That
abo. is too original for u 5.... W.A.H.: Wooden....
R.H.G.: Have another look at those hands....
C.R.S.: Only a genius can caricature without draw-
ing and —you’re not a genius... .J.R.W.: Hopelet-sl\

See why corns hurt
STUDY this X-Ray picture and
note the conical shape of
the corn. The corn is caused
by undue pressure and, once
formed, even a slight pressure
makes it hurt, because the point
of the corn presses directly on a
nerve.
Apply a “Blue-Jay” Plaster, and
you instantly remove the pressure,
and end the pain. Note the soft
felt ring (marked “A”) in the
Ulustration below. This pad
Blue ■ jay
The Sciervti-fic
Corrv Erxder/
gives wonderful comfort in the
tightest shoe.
But this pad is only a means to
an end. The B. and B. Wax in
the centre of the ring (“B”) cures
the corn and gives permanent re-
lief. In two days the corn can be
lifted out. Only extremely bad
corns need a second application.
That’s why “Blue-Jay” is popular
with corn sufferers. It gives im-
mediate ease, complete cure and
permanent relief.

An Australian Actress Praises
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery
I hare been using Dr.
Sheldon’s Sew Discovery dur-
ing the last three weeks, with
most marvellous results, and
I have decided that I would
write and tell you, for it was
not until this year that I
ever had occasion to try it.
For many years each win-
ter I was troubled with throat
trouble or colds. I used to
always have a recipe at the
chemist’s that was given to
me by a friend of mine. This
always seemed to help me a
good deal, and I thought it
was about as good as any-
thing I could get.
Unfortunately (as I thought
at the time) I lost this recipe,
and when I had the misfor-
tune to contract a bad cold
this year 'which affected my
voice seriously, I could not
And this recipe, and I was
recommended to try Dr.
Sheldon’s New Discovery by
a friend, who said she had
used it with great success. 1
obtained a bottle, and the
effect was marvellous. It is
simply astonishing how
quickly it helps one, for in
less than two days the cold
was entirely cured, and my
voice improved with the first
dose that I took. Needless to
say, I shall never bother about
getting any recipes put up
again, for New Discovery
shall always be my remedy
for a cold. 1 think it mar-
vellous.
Sincerely yours,

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BLACK land burned with fire,
Under a smoky sun,
Fierce is your dust of desire
For cool rivers that run
Siuging and flinging the green
Ot life into all things seen.
Springing and singing in grass,
Singing and springing in flowers
’! he hot winds when they pass
Madden with mocking of showers.
Only the dew comes here
With an early whisper clear,
And its lips low down on the plain,
Saying “My sister the rain
Is cool and gentle and sweet,
Be patient and patient and listen,
Black land, for her jewels that glisten t
And the dance of her little green feet.
We have been under the fire —
White whips aud red lashes
But the thirst of an old desire
Is hot in the ashes;
A thirst that pulses and quivers
For fountains and rivers,
For lakes that are blue in their dreaming
And white waters streaming,
For all the cool graces
Of shadowy places
Where the grass-blades may sing
To the sweet of the spring.
Conies the pale dew sighing and weeping
Like grey pearls for the noonday reaping.
Where is the rain, the bountiful rain,
To kindle green fire in the heart s dry
grain V
Will the sweet of the world come never
again ?
Black fields burned with fire,
A green rain comes
With banners of cloud
And winds of desire
And a beating of drums
Grown rapid and loud ;
And there shall bo spring for the parch-
ing seed
In a music of life that the world shall
heed!
Ah, life! Ah, spring!
What shall we sing'/
Heart of our folly, through folly grown
wise,
■Shall we rear the blossom that loves and
dies
Or cliDg to earth like the weed'/
X.S.W.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
The Botanist.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
CAPTAIN WILLIAM BLIGII, R.N.,
stood upon the poop of H.M.S. Pro-
vidence and cursed loudly and vigor-
ously-—as he was so well able to do —to the
great perturbation, scandalising and distress
of that mild and peaceful man of science,
Mr. Christopher Smith, botanist, of the
King’s Gardens at Kew.
“Oh, if you please, sir” —Bligh had stated
that the gentleman under discussion was ille-
gitimate—“l don’t think he i-s that. Not
that, sir! Indeed, he is a very worthy young
gentleman, sir, and very respectably eon-
neeted, and I am sure”
Bligh turned on him furiously.
“Blind your eyes and roast your ——
limbs in , sir. Who the devil gave you
leave to speak? If I say the fellow is a
, what have you to .say of
it? Damme, sir, d’ye know where you are?
You’re in a King’s ship, sir, I’d have you
to know that; and whatever the commanding
officer of such a ship rates any of the com-
pany, sir, that’s his rating. This young
Wiles is nothing but a sir.”
Mr. Smith’s round tortoise-shell spectacles
gave to his round face a mild and owl-like
look, and in his face at present was the
aspect of great fear and concernment. He
kpew that- the captain of the Providence was
wont to swear; but Mr. Smith had never
expected that he, Christopher Smith, A.M.,
would himself be sworn at by the choleric
gentleman, and was a little uncertain as
to the proper manner of comporting him-
self in such circumstances. He did not
know how to speak this sort of language,
and any other kind, it seemed to him, might
risk having a construction of mutiny placed
upon it, by reason of its disrespectfulness
in not being couched in the captain’s own
terms. Captain Bligh—naturally, after the
Bounty affair —was a little susceptible and
touchy as to mutiny, and conduct that might
savor of it in the most remote degree was
inadvisable in his presence. He felt ner-
vously certain that any defence of his col-
league was out of the question. So he re-
mained sjlent, and Bligh continued to bellow
his disapproval of his fellow-scientist, Mr.
James Wiles, also of rhe Royal Gardens.
H.M.S. Providence lay in the harbor of
Matavai, in the island of Tahiti, scarcely
a mile south-west of Point Venus, whence
23 years before Captain Cook’s expedition
in H.M.S. Endeavor had observed the transit
of the planet across the face of the sun.
The wide bay, with its long sweep of
gleaming beach separating light-blue waters
reflecting a cloudless sky from the green of
the tropical forest shore, the densely-wooded
bills and the opal-tinted mountains in the
background, lay still and placid in the noon-
tide heat, dotted with only a few' canoes
paddling in a leisurely fashion to and from
toe Providence and her tender the little
Assistant. All the wealth of color in the
scenery, the aromatic, warm scents w'afting
across the waters from the shore, the lazy
indolence of the prospect, seemed strangely
out of keeping with the commander’s dis-
play of heat. Mr. Smith felt vaguely that
this was not the sort of dav to be angry
on. The very balminess of the atmosphere
breathed a spirit of forgiveness and toler-
ance. And, after all, they did not really
know that Jimmy Wiles was at fault. It
was all supposition on Captain Bligh’s part.
The young man might have been actuated
by the worthiest of motives. He must
explain. When the commander should have
ceased to use this dreadful language lie would
explaiu.
“Damn yon, pay attention, sir!”
Mr. Smith started nervously and his three-
cornered hat fell upon the deck as he re-
moved his gaze from the glowing picture
framed between the edge of the poop-awning
and the rail, and turned it mildly upon the
red and angry face of Captain Bligh.
“Sir,” he stammered, “I beg”
“Be silent, sir, and listen to me. Keep
your mouth shut What I want to
know is, what like was this young woman
this fellow Wiles went off with?”
“She was in great distress, if you please,
sir. Greatly put about she was, crying aud
weeping and seeming to implore help, so
that Mr. Wiles” *
“D —u it, sir, are you an idiot? I did
not ask you to tell me how the artful hussy
piped her eye—’tis an old dodge, common to
black and white. I wished you to give me
some description of her. Tell me something
of her appearance. And be quick about it,
—— your eyes 1”
Mr. Smith was almost weeping himself.
Well, sir, she was extremely good-looking,
I think. Very well formed and active, and
had a soft voice. About 17 or, maybe, 19
years old, I should say. An attractive young
person. But her appearance was marred
somewhat by a sad blemish. She”
“A blemish ! What sort of a blemish?”
“She bad but one eye, sir.”
Captain Bligh dashed his clenched right
fist into his left: palm and stamped his silver-
buckled shoe upon the deck. For a moment
or two he was silent; then he exploded into
such a rapid-fire outburst of blasphemous
oaths that Mr. Smith furtively shuddered,
and would, if he had dared, have stopped up
his ears with his forefingers. Presently the
commander became a little more coherent,
and turned with a snarl to the botanist.
“Well, now, see here, Mr. Smith. Your
d—d young calf of an assistant has got him-
self trapped. I’ll warrant he was not 20
paces out of your sight ere they had him
bound —trussed up like a pig—and were
carrying him off slung to a pole. Damme,
d’ye hear me?”
“Yes, Captain Bligh,” murmured Mr.
Smith mildly. “But who would seize him
and bind him, and why should they carry
him off?”
Bligh laughed scornfully.
“Any but a blind-eyed fool would have
seen that for himself. Hath it not come into
your comprehension. Mr. Smith, that a state
of war exists between these people of
Matavai and the people of Oparre, nearby?
I thought all in the ship were aware of that.
Otoo, the head of these people, informed
me that a one-eyed young woman of some
charm of person cunningly seduced away
some of Mr. Wetherbead’s men, of the
wrecked whaler Matilda, when they first
landed, and that they have not been heard of
since. He had a fear that she might attempt
the same with some member of our expedi-
tion, so that her tribe might be possessed
of an hostage whose safety they could hold
in the scale against any action I might take
against them on behalf of the people of
Matavai. D’ye see now? Damme, that's
what’s become of your second-botanist. And
now, I suppose, we must be at the trouble
of finding him. I doubt if the ’s worth
finding. Such a fool as to be led away
so simply deserves any fate! However,
Quartermaster!”
“Aye, aye, sir!”
“Have my gig piped away. And Mr.
Smith, do you accompany me. We will go
io the garden and search its neighborhood
first of all. The young ass may have dropped
some article that will indicate the direction
in which they have taken him.”
» * » «.
This was the voyage in which Bligh com-
pleted the work of transplanting the bread-
fruit to the West Indies which had been so
amazingly interrupted by the mutiny in the
Bounty in 1789. It turned out to be a com-
pletely futile undertaking, this task that had
occupied six years of the best part of his
Hie, for the negroes of the plantations in
Jamaica would have nothing to do with the
breadfruit as an article of diet after it had
been successfully acclimatised. But that
was not Bligh’s affair. . His part of the
business was performed with entire success,
and the voyage of the Providence and Assist-
ant was of immense importance as regards
the geography of the South Seas. Whilst
Arthur Phillip was strenuously endeavoring
to keep the beginnings of British Australasia
alive at Port Jackson. Bligh was blazing
trails through the Fijis, the New Hebrides
and the dangerous intricacies of the Coral
Sea and Torres Strait, which he marked so
well that they remaiu the roads for all who
have traversed these waters since his time.
The story of his passage between Cape York
and New Guinea is an epic of navigation.
The expedition had been most completely
equipped for the work it was engaged upon.
Unlike the vessels allotted by the Admiralty
to most of those naval officers who had be-
fore made great voyages in the new world of
the south—Dampier and Anson, for instance
—the ships with which Bligh was provided
were admirably adapted for the work they
had to do. were well found in every particu-
lar. and had been manned with a comple-
ment of officers and men that left little to
be desired on the score of personnel. If the
disaster of the Bounty had been a hazardous
unpleasantness for him. the reputation he
achieved over his wonderful boat voyage
of 3600 miles between Tofu and Timor was
the making of Bligh. Such a sailor and
map-maker had to be provided with the best
it was possible to procure. Even Cook had
not had such a serviceable vessel as the Pro-
vidence —a ship of 420 tons, staunchly built
and bandy—and the provision of the little
100-ton brig Assistant as a tender, and an
investigator of waters too shallow for the
larger craft, was a step that materially re-
duced the chance of disaster.
That part, of the expedition which consti-
tuted its raison d'etre had been most care-
fully attended to. The celebrated Sir Joseph
Banks, ever indefatigable in colonial intem-
ests, had made it his business to see to the
selection of two practical botanists from the
royal establishment at Kew. who could be
depended upon to attend efficiently to the
rather delicate work of digging up the young
breadfruit plants, potting them, and keeping
ffloniinued on ne&t ’pcge.)


Never Be Without
Buk
am
As every mother knows, it is actual experience that guides her
in building up the “indispensable” requirements of her home.
Few articles are so indispensable in the home as a box of
Zam-Buk, which heals the skin and drives pain and disease out
of the tissues in an entirely new way.
Moreover, Zam-Buk has the additional advantage of being
entirely free from the poisonous minerals and rancid animal fats
of cheap ointments and salves.
Zam-Buk is ready for use the moment it is wanted, and it quickly
SOOTHES & HEALS
the smarting Cut, the Burn or Scald got during cooking, and also
completely banishes the most obstinate attack of Eczema, Ulcers,
Piles, Ringworm, Chapped Hands, Chilblains and kindred
ailments.
Zam-Buk gives results more wonderful than anything
hitherto attained, and, as the prudent housewife soon finds,
both expense and suffering are saved by keeping a 1/6
or 3/6 box always handy.
The Perfect Healer
For WOUNDS
& SORES.
Zam-Buk is unequalled for rheumatism, sciatica, lumbago ant

FOOTBALLER’S INJURY.
Mr. W. ,J. Martin, Denison Street, Rockhampton,
Queensland, writes: —“Whilst playing football, T
was badly kicked on the shin, and 1 paid no atten-
tion to it at first. Not until I found my leg
swollen and inflamed did I begin to think about
applying anything to my injury. The discharge
from the wound was frightful, and I realised that
my leg was badly poisoned.
“On the advice of a friend I started using
Znm-Buk. It quickly dispelled the burning, throb-
bing pain, and drew out the bad matter. As I
continued with Zam-Buk the wound healed over
with healthy new skin. Now there is no trace of
the injury.”

them alive and healthy during the long voy-

elected to make the interesting science of

Cheerfully across his shoulder, us he disap-

When Captain Bligh and the distressed

enclosure, they were met by Mr. Pearce, the
lieutenant of marines in charge of the guard
at the garden, who carried in his hand the
hibiscus decorated straw head-covering of
the vanished botanist. He explained that

found it on the side of a gully about half-a-

“I incline to your own opinion, sir—that
lie’s been kidnapped. ’Tis suspicious that,
the night before last, one of the sentinels
had to fire upon two or three of the natives
who were scaling the fence. I think this
hiring away of Mr. Wiles is a trick of the
Oparre men, sir—to secure an hostage. No
doubt of that, sir.”
Bligh made no roplv, but turned and
walked into the enclosure, with a black look
upon the benevolent countenance that was
such a deceptive indicator of the quality of
his temper. He walked round the quad-
rangle containing the palm-leaf huts where
the guard lived, the sheltered beds with the
fresh young plants sprouting in their dark
mould, and a sapling flagstaff from whose
top the Union Jack' hung limply in the still,
hot afternoon.
The gai . deil stood 011 a s ii ght riBe near the
beach( about a quarter of a mile from the
point where Cook's observatory had been
erected, down behind which a little river
wound out of the hills into Matavai Bay.
Out on the broad waters the black hulls, with
their red-lined gun-ports, floated at their
nioorinirs a fow tinv knocks of on hops nml-
dling lazily in their vicinitj% Seaward of theni
the broad band of ocea n swept round from
Point Venus to the soU th-western headland
of the bay, a foreshortened belt of dark blue
aga inst the azure of the cloudless sky. Be-
yond that end of the bay high ranges dum-
bered in tho hot sunshine out of which
-through the forest on the plain behind the
iut the river do wed into a long lagoon
stretching parallel with the beach.
Captain Bligh climbed upon a mound in-
s'de the palisade of cut saplings, the sentry
hastily presenting arms, and stepping down
to give place to the commanding officer.
P ]j gb turned his angry gaze towards the
forest, and immediately yelled a fierce oath,
“Split my tops’ls!” he cried. “Here lie is,

‘Wlia.t dye think hell do to me, Robin?”
he inquired of Mr. Pearce, as they watched
the irate commander walk down towards
the beach.
'My dear Jimmy," said that facetious
.vouiig gentleman pleasantly—he and the
botanist were boon companions—“we are all,
course, very glad indeed to see vou hack
anu, ngst us safe and sound ; but’ ——
He shook his head sorrowfully,
“Well?” Mr. Wiles asked for information
a little anxiously.
“He’ll probably stretch a point of his
authority, and give you two dozen to begin
with. Under the Articles of War”
“But l don’t come under ’em. The
Articles of War don’t apply to me,” pro-
tested Mr. Wiles, paling a little.
."Ah, you don't know our Billy! He'll
make ’em apply. There’s hardly any limit
to his power as a post-captain in the Iloyal
Navy—on a job like this, especially.”
“Lord !"
"And ’tis like enough that, when we've
put to sea from here, he’ll keel-haul you, old
boy.”
"Keel-haul —what's that ?”
"Well, I’ve never seen it done myself.
But I understand they fasten a rope below
your arms, and heave you overboard to tow
for a while. Sometimes, I’ve been told, they
pull vou right under the ship, below the keel,
from one side to the other. I’ve heard the
captain say that if he ever caught any of
the men who put him out of the Bounty,
he’d keel-haul ’em before anything else was
done to them.”
Mr. Wiles’s face lit up with sudden in-
terest.
“The Bounty ! Does tin' captain take so
much interest in the Bounty people still?”
“ Interest! By Heavens, lie does! 80
much so that I believe he'd hand over both
the .ships for the chance of a fair half-hour
with the bare knuckles with Fletcher Chris-
tian, the master’s-mate who led the mutiny.
Lord, how he’d like to lay his hands on that
man ! Or on any of them, for the matter o’
that. You know how well he speaks the
lingo? Learned it when he was here with
Captain Cook in the Resolution, and in the
Bounty before they set him adrift. He
never meets a nigger he hasn’t met before
without cross-questioning him as to the pos-
sible whereabouts of any of the mutineers
who may be in Otaheite still. The man who
can bring one of ’em alive to Captain Bligh
’ll be a very lucky nigger, indeed! But
what's ideasing you so greatly, Jimmy? You
look a different man!”
Indeed, Mr. Wiles was transformed, and
oven the dejected Christopher Smith, hover-
ing sadly in the vicinity, cheered a little at
his brave grin.
“Where’s your d—d escort, Robin? Well,
let’s get aboard. I'm anxious to see the
captain.”
"Lord !” ejaculated his friend. “ ’Tis more
than I'd be, in your place.”
Young Mr. Wiles, botanist and amorist,
faced his fate with an equanimity that ivas
a little surprising to the latter —the scowling,
stocky gentleman in naval uniform who
glared at him across the writing-table.
Through the open stern-windows reflections
from the gleaming waters below the ship’s
counter set brilliant lights dancing among
the deck-beams overhead and playing upon
the composed and good-humored features of
the somewhat bedraggled botanist. He
listened to Bligh’s profanely abusive address
without apparent emotion, not seeming to lie
concerned very much as to whether lie was
a , a , or a , or whether the
Almighty might be listening favorably to
that gentleman's requests for the complete
and painful damnation of James Wiles.
“And,” concluded Bligh, “you stand there
like a d —cl stuffed monkey and make no
attempt to justify yourself," Come, wlnu
have you to say V’
Mr. Wiles’s gaze wandered about the
cabin—from the dazzling- frames of the win-
dows to the polished breeches of the two
brass guns crouching at their open ports on
either side—and took a little time to answer.
He smiled as he spoke.
“Well, sir—well, Captain Bligh-—I think
I’ve got some good news for you. ’Tis sorry
I am that my efforts on your behalf seem
to meet with such an equivocal reception.”
"By Heavens, I’ll teach you to jest with
me!”
"I am not jesting, sir. I have found out
where Fletcher Christian’s got to!"
There was a deathly silence for a few
moments, as the commander, of the Provi-
dence stared at the culprit with wide-open
eyes and parted lips. There was a look
of incredulous eagerness in his face. Mr.
Wiles’s quiet statement seemed to have dum-
founded him.
"What!" he gasped hoarsely, leaning across
the table.'
Presently he stood up, and thrust back his
chair.
"What!” he repeated, walking round the
table and confronting the young man
eagerly. "You've found where Christian
went to?”
"Arahaere —the young woman, you know—
she was a friend of his. She says he told
her he would take the Bounty to some empty
island in the Fijis, where lie would burn the
ship and settle down. She hath no doubt
he meant to go to the Fijis. She was mis-
tress to Christian, and he told her his inten-
tion.”
Bligh sat down again, and seemed a little
dazed by this piece of intelligence. lie
fiddled with the chart spread on the table
before him, and. taking up a pair of com-
passes, spun idle circles over the South
Pacific. Spasms twisted the muscles of his
face into a hideous grin of hatred and ven-
geance. His complexion grew nearly purple,
and Mr. Wiles thought of npqploxv.
"By (I—d !” murmured the victim of the
Bounty. “By G —d, I’ll have him! I'll put
the hound in H —l! By G —d !”
“Do you wish to speak to me, further,
sir?”
Bligh looked up. and seemed to recover
himself. lie leaned back in his chair and
Mr. Wiles knew that the situation was .saved,
so far as he was concerned.
“No, no, you may go, Mr. Wiles. lam
grateful to you. Damme, yes. Come and
sup with me this evening. I must hear
more of this. In the meantime, I wish to
be alone. You may go, sir. 1 thank you
for your information. ’Tis verv valuable.”
Down in the gun-room Mr. Wiles found his
anxious colleague, and laughed heartily at his
.solemn face.
“ ’Tis all right. Christopher—a happy
thought hath been m.v deliverance!”
The chart that Bligh made of the Fiji
group well attests the signal service rendered
to geographical knowledge by Mr. James
Wiles, of the Royal Gardens at Kew.

The power to inspire confidence is one of the greatest assets of whisky as it is of man. But there must be U
solid foundation of worthiness. Dewar's is always the same grand and genial spirit ever constant ip I
promotion of good fellowship. So unchangeable is its seductive charm that men rightly call it
THE SPIRIT SUPERB.
