THE RED PAGE
The ideal Bohemia should have the Mer-
maid Tavern and several others near the sea
coast, for half its charm is of the time when
the yellow gases all are lit and the poets full
in blow. That country, however-, like the
fabled Hy-Brasil, can only be seen on the
dim horizon in youthful dreams. It is the
region of freedom from restraint and con-
vention, of perpetually bubbling gaiety and
wit, and many famous men and delectable
ladies have resided there. There is, how-
ever, a real Bohemia nearer to view, which is a
never failing source of interest to all entrants
into literary and artistic life. To some it
means only the capital city, “ the beautiful
City of Prague ” ; but for others its bound-
aries are the ever-shifting ones of the gipsy
camp and the open road. Each generation
furnishes a crop of youths who are drawn by
the glamor of the vagabond life to wander
like Borrow and Davies, the super-tramp ;
or to give a temporary latitude and longitude
to a Bohemia within the lights of their own
city. Henri Murger provided the plans and
specifications of a modern Bohemia for those
blessed (or cursed) with “the artistic tempera-
ment,” and located it in. the city of Paris.
His people are the gay, happy-go-lucky, non-
moral Bohemians who give tlie prudes delight-
ful shivers. “ Museite and Mimi ! The
image of those ideal beings shone on every
man who, was twenty-one about 1848. La,
Vie de Boh'eme was youth’s breviary—fifty
years ago,” wrote iSarcey, the dramatic
critic. Their image still shines from the
novel and opera on later generations, and is
refracted in Trilby and many another form.
And Paris is still the place, above all others,
where Bohemia has the widest boundaries
and the finest inhabitants. Ail foreign
Bohemians when they die go to Paris.
The constitutional stolidity of the British,
‘ and their aversion from anything irre-
gular, have always checked the growth
of Bohemia in Britain. Only in a furtive
and -shamefaced way has it been pos-
sible for rebellious youths to peg out
their little lots ; the bolder spirits who
flourished their red umbrellas in the face of
the public were.quickly chilled by the steely
glare of Grundy or the derisive laughter of
’Arriet. Dan ton’s motto, “ L’audace, tou-
jours l’audaee,” was characteristically Fr ench;
the English variant, quoted in The Paery
Queen , is “Be bolde, be bolde. . . . Be not too
bolde.” The English Bohemians have seldom
gone beyond little eccentricities in hair and
costume. The. typical British poet and artist
of the nineteenth century—Tennyson and
Leighton—dressed their parts carefully ac-
cording to the convention, lived ordered and
placid lives, and were duly translated to the
Britisher’s heaven—the House of Lords.
In France all good poets have dwelt, for a
time, at any rate, in Bohemia. They played
fantastic tricks there, did mad things at
times, especially in the days of Petrus Borel
and Lassailiy ; but their madness was. gener-
ally picturesque. Gerard de Nerval leading
a lobster through the Palais Royal with a
piece of blue ribbon, which he justified
by explaining that “lobsters are no more
ridiculous than dogs, they neither bark nor
bite, and, besides, they know the secrets ef
the sea,” is an example of the extravagancies
to which revolt against established theories
and customs led some of the finest souls of
the time.
An interesting picture of the upper circles
of Bohemian life in Paris is given in
Lepelletier’s .'book on Verlaine. The salon
of Nina de Callais, friend of all the Par-
nassians, was one of many meeting-places of
the elect, and the following is amaccount of
it when in.full swing during 1868-9 :
There was no closing hour at, Nina’s ; the door
was always-, open and the table spread. There
were three sofas often occupied after the departure
of the bulk of the guests, by thos iO lived at a
distance, and feared to return hom in the small
hours. At whatever time one retired one was not
the last. I never could make out when Nina, at
length left alone, went to bed for a well-earned
repose.
Growing notabilities and coming celebrities found
themselves cheek by jowl at Nina’s. To be seen
were Frangois Ooppee, with his First Consul face,
reciting in melancholy fashion his Intimites;
Leon Dierx of the poetic isles, tossing back his
beautiful black hair as he declaimed his Filaos.
Charles Cros describing in mocking tones the
oscillations of a red herring, suspended from a
wall bare, bare, bare at the end of a thread- long,
long, long ; a tale invented to amuse the children,
little, little, little; Anatole. France, Mendes,
Merat, Valade, and all the habitues of the Salon
Bicard, while Charles de Sivry improvised at the
piano, Dumont played Hungarian airs on the
zither, Frances, the splendid comedian of the
Palais-Royal, with the shrewd face of a country
cure, recounted, swelling his voice and rolling his
eyes as fiercely as he could, how Sarragossa was
taken, Henri Cros, modeller in wax, quietly repro-
duced in a corner the little head of the mistress of
the house, and Villiers de I’lsle-Adam grimaced
and reeled off the most unexpected apothegms of
Dr. Tribulat Bonhomet, heroic Prudhoinn.o and
huge Homais. . . .
Raoul Rigault would propose a'toast to Chau-
mette- or A each arsis Klobtz, in between a
pantoum of Mallarme’s aud a Fete yalante of
Verlaine’s, recited by the authors, or the waltz of
the Sylphes, played by Ferdinand Revillon,
pianist and popular agitator, afterwardsmanager
of the Customs under the Commune.
The amusements were of the most varied kind.
Charades were improvised, Jeanne Samary, the
future Martine of the ThetUre-Francais. opened
the treasure-box of her laughing mouth, reciting
fragments of her repertoire; her incessant laugh
rippling forth as if set in motion by a spring.
Catulle Mendes, shaking his fair hair, slowly and
gravely sang “Les vaches au flalic roux qui
portent les aurores.” Coppee parodied Theodore
de Bativille. Imitations were given of popular
comedians, Gil Peres, Lassouehe, Brasseur.
Military anecdotes were narrated, long before
they formed part of the repertoire of Bolin, who
reproduced them, and lastly, laments were
chanted, and burlesque Christinas carols intoned,
reviewing the events of the year in vaudeville
couplets. Nina’s salon was, to a certain extent,
in the mockery, fantasy, nonsense, ami modernity
of its poems, songs and little plays, all invented
in the highest of spirits, the predecessor aud fore-
runner of the Chat Npir.
Though Drowse’s “ industry, hope and an
aim ” were nob often found together in many
of them, these men aimed at the deliverance
of art- from vulgar pedantry and formality;
they entered their protest againt the-slavery
of routine, and with all their drinking and
idling, some of them did things which the
world is much less willing to let die than the
work of a multitude of highly respectable
persons. The mistake some of them made
was that they stayed'too long in Bohemia.
It is to be passed through in youth, for its
atmosphere is rarefied, and lengthy residence
there is apt to unsettle one for the dull,
every-day world.
For many years Paul Verlaine was king in
Bohemia,, and, unfortunately, he lived there
till the end of his life. The Verlaine
of many legends is the squalid old
man of ribald speech ’ d esc in ued by
Vance Thompson in French Portraits:--
“ His face was like the mask of Socrates
with high cheek-bones and simian mouth.
The nose was flat, camous and broken ; the
great bald head covered with knobs like a
battered helmet ; a draggled beard hung
about the cheek and chin ; the ears were flab
and lahge. The eyes, those deep-set, dreamy,
intolerably vague eyes, glowered at me from
beneath rugged square-hewn brows.” This
was the man painted by Degas in “ The
Absinthe Drinker ” with a tipsy woman of the
streets sprawling nearby. George Moore, one
of the first of the English to discover Ver-
laine, saw “ the cavernous eyes, the macabre,
expression of burnt-out lust smouldering
upon his face.” And nearly all the
crimes of the calendar were ascribed
to the poet. Verlaine expressed his
various moods fully and freely in his
poems, and their apparent incongruity,
added to the stories about Rimbaud, the
imprisonment, and the vacillations between
the cafe and the hospital, helped to make
him an incarnation ,of bad Bohemianisin ;ind
an awful example for the English. That
exquisite poetry should come from such
a man seemed more incredible to the philis-
tine than the finding of a jewel in the head
of the toad.
Here and there the legend was mitigated
by the accounts of other visitors, such
as Zangwill, who found the poet “ simple
child-like and homely” ; Gosse,.the literary
lion-hunter, described him as a mild,
rnoth-lihe man, and even Moore lived
to recant the version given in The Con-
fessions of a Young Man. But not until
the publication of Paul Verlaine , His Life —
His Work , by Edmond Lepelletier (Werner
Laurie), was it possible for the English
reader to get at the facts beneath the myth,
and know that many of the atrocious stories
were invented by Verlaine himself. Lepel-
letier was closely associated with the poet
for thirty-six years, and was entrusted by Ver-
laine with the task of defending his reputa-
tion. He lias done so without extenuating
the faults of his friend nor-'obtruding himself
over much. He need not, however, have
endeavored to transfer some of the blame of
Verlaine’s lapses on to the shoulders of the
poet’s wife and mother. Verlaine’s own
character as he portrays it is a sufficient
explanation of all the trouble. Lepelletier
gives a clue to the perplexity of that
character in the statement that he lived for
sensation. For this reason, he wantonly
circulated libels about himself, quarrelled
and made up with the impossible Rimbaud,
was by turns good husband and a
loose liver, blasphemous and devout.
The art of verse brought thrills more
glorious than any, but for physical sensa-
tion he had resort to absinthe, and more
absinthe—and then all the rest was in-
evitable. He was the sport of circumstance,
a “poor rudderless boat,” as Lepelletier
calls him, “ nobody’s enemy but his own,”
in the pious phrase.
Lepelletier’s biography gives a detailed
account of Verlaine’s career with piany
letters and some photographs—a bulkier
volume, perhaps, than was necessary ;
nevertheless a very readable one, and
valuable, not only for the truth about
Verlaine, but for its sidelights on many
other interesting characters of the most
brilliant period in French literature.
La Vie de Boheme
The sea coast of Bohemia
Is pleasant to the view.
When singing larks spring from the grass
To fadeflnto the blue,
And all the hawthorn hedges break
In wreaths of purest snow,
And yellow daffodils are out,
And roses half in blow.
James Hebblethwaite.
I dwelt in a city enchanted,
And lonely indeed was my lot;
.Two guineas a week, all I wanted,
Was certainly all that I got.
Well, somehow I found it was plenty,
Perhaps you may find it the same,
If— if you are just five and twenty,
With industry, hope, and an aim ;
Though the latitude’s rather uncertain,
And the longitude also is vague,
The persons I pity who know not the city,
The beautiful City of Prague.
JEFFERY PROWSE.
A Vanished Atmosphere
We had Bohemia here once upon a time.
Wherever three, or four of us met together
and forgot the work-a-day world, there lay
Bohemia. Sometimes it was in a boat on
the harbor; sometimes on the heights of
Darlinghurst at a sunset hour, when, look-
ing westward, we saw the city, dome and
steeple, bathed in smoky gold : and some-
times on the darkened side of a moonlit
street, with pine trees dreaming above us.
On Saturday morning, at the witching hour
of the wallcing ghost, it was usually situated
near the Bulletin office.
In those days Australian Art and Litera-
ture were, perhaps, a decade younger
than they are .to-day. The added years may
have brought them increase of stature, but,
if •they have gained in many tilings, I do not
think that they have gained in everything.
An atmosphere is just as necessary to the
painting of a picture and the writing of a
poem as it is to the making of seas, and.
rivers and forests, and in the days of which I
write we had at least the beginnings of an
atmosphere—rarefied and only just palpable,
perhaps, but still not without possibilities.
Travel where you like to-day through the
broad thoroughfares of Melbourne, or the
crooked, streets, of Sydney, and you will
search in vain for any signs of such an atmo-
sphere. Here and there, it may be, you will
liiid a fellow, with eyes indifferent .to' the
world about him, engaged in turning over
a . theme for verses or- an idea for a
painting, but mostly our artists and our
writers are so busy endeavoring to get ends
to meet that they have no time for wayside
talk and merriment. The bid lighthearted,
casual spirit of the past, ..which took no
thought of the. morrow, or \ the shadow on
the threshold, has vanished from our literary
and artistic circles, and the writer and the
painter have been taught to know that the
butcher and the baker and the candlestick-
maker are personages whom he must not
utterly despise-—laughing at their accounts
rendered as though these were sublimely
humorous documents.
What made 'the literary and artistic atmo-
sphere of a decade ago possible was the faith
which each worker had in his work—that it
was good and would live—ami a belief deep
down in his soul that Australia cared for him
and loved his work. When he came to
realise his limitations, came to recognise
himself as just a lark in a cage, and not a
lark in the sky, he began to feel that the
only thing for him to clo was to step down
from his pedestal, and march with the multi-
tude. When he discovered that the vast
majority of his countrymen did not care a two-
penny-toss for him or for Ills work, and con-
sidered a century by Trumper as a -finer
achievement than the best poem or painting
which Australia ever produced, he lost no
time in realising that there- was. no sense
or reason in trying to help a nation to a
thing that it did not want.
The. men who lived in that atmosphere
were lhen of various tempers, but all of them
'were linked in a common love of art arid liter-
ature. There was no pettiness, no spite
amongst them. Sometimes,, one with mous-
taehios would disturb the serenity of the
moment’s talk by alleging that another knew
nothing of some tabled topic, and offering
by his halidom to' prove it then or there-
after ; but mostly a fine spirit of give-and-
take characterised our meetings. Amongst us
was an artist who considered the horse a
whole heaven of strength and '■ graph and
beauty, -and who was given to saying that
one day he would put that animal on canvas
not idealised (for that would lie like painting
the lily, since the horse in itself is an 'ideal
thing) : but the whole animal body of-bone .
and muscle, skin of satin, and eyes wherein
there shone a soul. The artist had eyes with
a soul in them himself—proud, unbrooking,
aquiline eyes, and an Emperor’s contempt,
for anything mean or tawdry.
There was always stillness, acquiescence,
a spirit of surrender to the charm of the
moment, as to the charm of some singer
singing beautifully, when Victor Daley re-
cited rhymes or told us some story of the
days when he and Harold Grey .set the-
Harbor on fire and the Yarra in flame—or of
other days when, in the green vicinity of
Navan Rath, the spirit of old-time kings and
a vanished fairydom descended on him in
the twilight, whispering many a fancy which
he voiced in after verse and-prose.
vO
Daley wrote and talked with ease, but he
was so much of an artist that his fancies,,
whether in verse or converse, always went
abroad in charming raiment. Whenever he
sent an idea into the world, he saw to it that
it was costumed tastefully, always bore a
flower in its buttonhole or a feather in its
cap ; and even when it happened to be a
mere midget of an idea, these decorations
invested it with a special enhancement. He
had great work to do—fine poems to write—
but the time for essaying them was not yet—
and it never was. Perhaps what mattered with
him most was what mattered most with many
of us—too much talk and too little achieve-
ment. Perhaps, too, the world’s, view of
the dreamer and the singer (although he
never confessed to it) influenced him not a
little. When he discovered that his neigh-
bor on one side, who made a livelihood by
selling socks behind the counter, and his
neighbor on the other, who balanced ledgers
for a'living, regarded him as something alien
and aloof from their everyday world, it may
be that he conceived incertitude as to the
value of his place in the Scheme of Things,
and ceased to regard himself as an altogether
serious proposition'.
Most of us have a vast respect for the
modern man and the modern man's point of
view. Time, through thousands of years
and a score of civilisations, with patching
hands and paring fingers, has made him what
he is ; and, if his point of view is not the
correct one, then someone ought to prevail
on Time to leave off meddling in man’s,
making, and get other work to do. In the
modern point of view, the visible, the
practical, the tangible are. the things that
matter; and the modern man can under-
stand suburban lots being sold at auction, or
terraces of jerry-built villas, or great, glaring
oleographs in gilt frames ; but what kind of
opinion can he have of a fellow who wants to
sell him a whole series of gold and purple
sunsets'?
“ Vo u can have the whole lot of them
cheap,” said YictoE “ I’m selling out as a
poet. To-morrow I am going into the Post
Office, to add up figures. Henceforth I
intend to earn my living honestly.”
, All the «samo, lie came back to his sunsets.
Adding up figures from 9 a.m. to 4.30 p.m.,
for five and a half days a week at ten shillings
a day, didn’t compensate for their loss,
vf/
Bohemia has passed away from us, or, if
it has not passed away, it has, at least, so
altered the Shape of its mountains, and the
color of its trees, and the singing of its
rivers, that ' none of us can recognise it as
our old, familiar realm of dre;uns. The
atmosphere that made, it a pleasant breath-
ing place seems to have vanished too, and I
do not think that that is a good thing for
Australia.

A new “Thrilling Adventure Library,” ■

story follows . the' same formula as The
Bishop's Scapegoat, by T. B. Clegg, pub-

herself is unique. We have not met in
fiction anything like this siren, with
wealth arid passions on a ,colossal
scale, who sinks into an opinth-sodden
fiend, devoting her life to the pursuit
of a merciless vengeance. There is a great
deal of cleverness in the writing, wide know-
ledge, and flashes of brilliant description ;
but we think the authors have overshot the
mark, tried to get too much thrilling adven-
ture into the book, and made the principal

SLEEPLESSNESS.
Mr. -Tames Bell, bootmaker, of 16 Parramatta-
road, Petersham, is not one of the fortunate ones
who escaped the invasion of influenza, which was
experienced in this country afew years ago. Speak-
ing on the subject to our reporter, Mr. Bell said :
“ Influenza is a complaint that has singled me
out for attention more than once, as I had an
attack when living in New Zealand, and again in
this country. If there is anything worse for com-
pletely making a wreck of a man, I would like to
know what it is. So far as lam concerned, it
made a thorough hash of my health, and a pretty
tough time I had before I made any headway
against it. The heavy burning pains in my head
were something terrible, for they had the effect of
making me so despondent that I could find no
pleasure in life at all. If a man’s head is not clear
and free from pain, all the money in the world
would not make him happy, and I was far from
it, believe me. As each day dawned, so were
those wretched aches in attendance, as if for the
purpose of casting a gloom over my life. Tly mouth
was dry and parched, and there waf a fever-
ishness right through my body, which was most
distressing. Not one of ray limbs was free from
aches of a very tiresome nature—aches that were
positively painful, and when I stood upon my feet
my legs felt as if they would collapse beneath me.
Together with these discomforts was a feeling of
restlessness which served to intensify my unhappi-
ness, for I could not rest contented anywhere for
any length of time, and completely exhausted my-
self in moving about from place to place.”
“It would not take much exertion to tire you,
and you’d be glad to get to bed at night?”
“Well, for all the sleep I got, I might just as
well have been up and about, for that was one of
the peculiarities of my sickness. Although I felt
so feeble and tired that I could have dropped any-
where, yet when I retired to rest I found much
difficulty in getting to sleep. And I had gone on
m a very bad way for a considerable time when I
happened to be put on to a medicine that altered
the whole aspect of my affairs. An old employer
of mine from Melbourne saw m 6 one day and
explained how ill he had been from the same com-
plaint as mine, and said that he had been quite
fixed up by Elements Tonic, at tfne same tin*
strongly urging me to get some.”
“ And you put his advice into effect?”
“ I am pleased to say I did, and I consider A
about the best step I ever took in my life, for the
unpleasantness I was laboringunder began to vanish
from that date. I don’t think I said anything
about the dizzy feelings I used to have when my
head seemed to spin round like a top, neither did
I mention the unsettled state of my nerves, which
had become quite unhinged, and my appetite had
left me long ago. And the longer my sufferings
existed the greaterthe feeling of depression became
The lowness of spirits was something terribly
and I hadn’t enough energy to try and shake it
off. Sickness always fetches one down, and, my
word, it succeeded in doing so in my case. My
digestive organs were altogether disarranged, too,
in consequence of which I endured no end of dis-
comfort after swallowing any nourishment. Pains
affected me about the shoulders and the loins, and
in the chest there was an unusual heaviness that
testified to the undigested condition of my food.
But I came to the turn in the road when I began
to employ Clements Tonic, which is easily the
best medicine I have ever had any experience
with. And I think that, as influenza and the
other ailments I suffered from are so frequently
encountered, it is only my duty to tell my fellow
citizens how they can be cured, as I was
Clements Tonic is the thing. It added strength
to my enfeebled system with each dose, it invigor-
ated my nerves in a way that astonished me; it
brought sleep to my hitherto restless nights; it
provided the appetite that enabled me to eat; and,
finally, it restored my internal organs to that state
of healthfulness which enabled me to digest what-
ever food I did take. Report these facts for
others’ good.”

Marooned.
We kissed our weeping sweethearts
(They reckoned we’d be drowned);
Then the skiff set sail in a south-east gale
With a wet sheet, outward bound ;
We swung her nose into Broken Bay
And camped along the shore,
And the cook fried fish in a new tin dish
While we hollered out for more.
We had no use for trousers,
Not as trousers go, in camp,
So we rammed our rags in the sugar-bags
To save them getting damp ;
We turned in tired as a lumping gang,
We’d sandflies in the tent,
And a spider big as a guinea-pig ;
'Twas a lively night we spent.
We woke up late and hungry—
\nd there was no skiff to see ;
For the cook was gone with his trousers on,
With the truck and wardrobes three.
We cursed that cook all we knew and more,
Till seagulls screamed for joy,
And we fried the fish in an old tin dish
That we used for cungevoi.
We thought of home and mother,
And the evil we had done,
While we searched the rig for a bit of pig,
an egg, but found not one.
We had no smokes nor a drop of beer—
That cook had done us brown,
And the camp was bare of a rag to wear,
So we could not go to town.
With half an inch of whiskers
We looked a graceless crew ;
We’d have paid a pound for a steak well browned
And a quart of beer for two.
One day up-beach we a mermaid saw
A-chewing kelp and clan),
And we said “Good-day,” and she swam our way
With a pot of seaweed jam.
We asked her would she board us ;
She smiled and said she would.
Oh, the cungevoi was a dish of joy,
And the shark’s-egg soup was good !
She won our hearts with a kiton stew
And a salad of young green kelp ;
I fell in a deep and pleasant sleep
Half through my seventh help !
She came each morn to breakfast —
Oh, the seaweed tea was fine ;
And we dived for spoons in the afternoons.
And she thought the fun divine ;
At dusk we swam down the homeward track,
Through miles of crumbling foam,
Where the way was bright with the white moon-
light
We left her, half-way home.
She said her name was Lulu,
She was sweet-and-twenty-one—
And the things she knew would astonish you,
And her hair was always done.
One day I chanced on an old bull-seal,
I coaxed him home to tea ;
But Lulu fled when he poked his head
In the tent and winked at me.
That bull-seal talked till midnight;
The yarns he told were true.
But we had no care nor a rag to wear.
And we’d supped on jelly-fish stew.
We laughed and chaffed and we smoked seaweed
Till the seal lay down to snore,
And we slept till eight, for the tea was late ;
But Lulu came no more !
We grub on seal and seaweed
(Oh, a bull-seal steak is tough !),
And we still fry fish in the same old dish—
But the life is rather rough.
I dream sometimes of a kiton stew,
With salad and seaweed jam ;
But the beastly smell of the fish is Hell,
And the camp ain’t worth a damn !

The Age of Gold.
“ Here I, Apollyon, fallen from on high,
Stand ’mid the wrack of primal war cast down,
When God the golden paving-stone let fly,
And angels pelted me with harp and crown.”
So spake the Evil One, with growing rage,
Till, in a frenzy, frightful to behold,
He tore and hurled the debris from his cage,
And strewed the bubbling world with shredded
gold.
The tortured waters closed in hot ferment
O'er harp and crown, and Heaven’s paving-
stone.
And with the flying dust the Earth was rent,
Till treasure gemmed its ev’ry rib and bone.
And then came Man—a happy, hunting child—
To laugh, and love, and live without a care,
Save when the milking troglodytes were wild,
Or there was lack of good steak-giving bear.
Till one fell day the Man—or Woman—twigged
An angel who, its vanity to sate,
In its full gold and white regalia rigged,
Had got its picture on a fashion plate.
Since then Men haunt no more the sunlit plain.
But in the Earth’s abysmal places creep
Striving to wrest from her great heart again
The twice-cursed gold e’en Satan would not
keep.

TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY
MUDDLE; LATEST EDITION.
Within the last few days terrible revelations have
been made as to the barrenness and hopelessness
and drouth of the country which would be traversed
if the shortest, straightest and cheapest trans-
continental line—that from Port Darwin to Port
Augusta —were built. A shrieking wilderness of
dry bones and old grey horrors and fantods and
jim-jams and devils and griffins, it seems, is that
central laud. Still, people have motored across it,
and the reason why the motorists failed badly in
their first attempt was that they were bogged
amid excessive rain ; also the telegraph line-
repairers traverse the route daily, . year in
and year out, and somehow seem to miss
the worst of the alleged miseries. Yet the
miseries, it appears, are there all the same. It
was only to be expected that this dreadful intelli-
gence would transpire about now, for a
scheme has suddenly come to the front for
diverting the transcontinental railway eastward,
and making it a line from Port Darwin through
Queensland and N.S.W. to Swan Hill and Mel-
bourne. There are all manner of interesting
features about this scheme. It appeals to the old
and lamentable Australian doctrine that every
work—whether it is a transcontinental railway or
a Federal capital or a naval depot, or anything
else—which is calculated to create a new popula-
tion should be so fixed as to bring that population
where the most population is already. On a purely
selfish and parish-minded basis, a line through
the more thickly-peopled States, where it is least
wanted, will, of course, command more votes than
one through an empty country where settle-
ment is most wanted. But no man can afford
to say openly that he is a mere parochialist
who is willing to sell the interests of Australia for
the profit of his own State and lii.s own electorate
and his own kitchen garden. A certain decent
reticence is advisable in such matters.
And in the present case quite a lot of decent
reticence is called for, and it is advisable that the
cloak of hypocrisy should be extra large size. For
it is proposed :
(1) That the much-talked-of transcontinental railway
idea should be abandoned in exchange for something
much more like a coastal line.
(2) That the length of the line from north to south
should be increased by many hundreds of miles.
(3) That the Commonwealth should take over the
Territory, and then, instead of building a railway right
through it to develop the common property of Australia,
it should build one which would scoot in all possible haste
right out of the Territory and leave it undeveloped.
(4) That the taking over of the Territory with the
money of the whole Commonwealth should be regarded
as a reason for building, at the expense of all Australia,
6GO miles of railway in the Territory (Australia’s common
property), 1313 miles of railway in Queensland for that
.State’s special benefit ; and 480 miles of line in N.S.W.
The support of Queensland and N.S.W. is supposed to be
bought by the proposal that 1793 miles of their State rail-
ways are to be constructed at the cost of all Australia.
The support of Victoria is supposed to be purchased by
the suggestion that the deviated transcontinental railway
is to connect with the Victorian system at Swan Hill, and
put Melbourne in direct communication with Port
Darwin.
(5) That S.A., which has kept the white man’s flag
flying in the North for half a century, should be cut out
of the Territory’s trade altogether.
(6) That the line should go so far east as to make its
connection with Westralia practically impossible.
With such a gigantic public job on hand, it is
plainly up to the parties concerned to suddenly
discover awful things about the country along the
track of the proposed straight line. It is a time
tor the eloquent person who has never been there
to write to the papers and relate his terrible ex-
periences, and, if possible, get paid for them. It
is a time for hustle, and the gathering together of
dry bones and horrible evidence. The case is that
of the proposed Federal capital on Monaro all
over again. While the issue was in doubt the
Monaro country was a wretched, barren, hopeless,
forbidding, uninhabitable land, where nothing
grew, and where coaches were blown over, and
where life was utterly horrible. But now that the
Australian capital seems to be fixed at Yassberra,
where the Sydney daily papers can be delivered
every morning before breakfast, the old, despised
Monaro has become a picture land—the prize
Eden and boss health resort of Australia; and
the N.S.W. tourist department spends as much
money on advertising it as is spent on all the other
beauty spots of the State pu t together; and the State
Government has built a huge hotel on Kosciusko,
which hostelry is crowded to the doors ; and Mr.
Percy Hunter lectures about the place; and
illustrations concerning it are stuck up at railway
stations and similar populous spots, and a railway
is to be built into the despised region so that its
fertility may become accessible. Monaro has
got past the period when it was necessary for the
parochialists to lie about it as a place where life
was practically impossible. Central Australia
has just arrived at the period of lying and con-
tumely.
■*•***
The first charge laid against the straight line is
that the country through which it is to run is a
desert. That is a mere detail, for every place in
Australia has been called a desert at one time or
another. Victoria was wholly abandoned for 20
years (1804-1824) on a charge of being an utterly
damned and incurable desert. It is also alleged
that a great part of the route covered by the
straight line is almost rainless, to which it may plead
guilty—with the reservation that the first party
which motored over the route was bogged and
drenched and almost washed away. As an
extenuating circumstance, however, it may be
mentioned that the portion of Australia which
as a regular thing receives less than lOin. of rain
per annum covers part of Westralia, S.A., the
Territory, Queensland and N.S.W., and that the
proposed lengthy eastern deviation would run
through exactly the same sort of unwatered
country as the straight line. In fact, there is
much more of the almost rainless land in Queens-
land and N.S.W. than in the Territory (Queens-
land has 135,000 and N.S.W. 81,000 square miles
of it, while the Territory has only 6000 square
miles), and the great dry belt extends right down
to and beyond Broken Hill (N.S.W.), where the
proposed deviation is to go, so the long-
distance, crooked eastern line seems a mere
useless lingering in a dry land. Moreover,
the straight line strikes one big oasis on
its way, for the McDonnell Ranges have a real
rainfall and some rivers ; while the deviation
strikes no oasis or rivers or genuine rainfall what-
ever. The McDonnells, as a matter of fact, con-
stitute the only oasis which Central Australia
possesses. The dry belt (as shown on the
map in the Official Year Book of Australia,
for 1909, page 13S) is at its narrowest in Westralia
and at its widest in Western Queensland and
N.S.W., while along the middle course of the
proposed straight line from Port Darwin to Port
Augusta it is at least fairly narrow. And the
great northern well-watered belt is at its very
widest where the straight line from Port Darwin
to Port Augusta would travel, while it is at its
very narrowest in the western part of North
Queensland where the proposed deviation is to
meander along.
* * * *
It is further alleged by the excited crowd, gang
or multitude, which wants to have the money of
all Australia spent in building State railways in
Queensland and N.S.W., that S.A. has made such
a lamentable failure of the Territory, as shown by
its decreasing population (though the decrease is
wholly among Chinaman and such) that it has no
right to make terms for the transfer of the pro-
perty. This seems hardly logical, for even the
poorest and most unfortunate seller has the same
right to put a price on his goods as the richest.
But apart from that aspect of the case, it is worth
while to remember that the Territory is only
going through a very ordinary experience. It has
made its first attempt at settlement, and because
of the isolation of the settlement the attempt has
been a comparative failure. The first isolated
settlement in Victoria was also a failure, and that
“desert” land was abandoned, and wallabies ate
grass and hit out with their hind feet at din-
goes on the present site of the Age office
for another 20 years. The first settlement in
Central Queensland was a failure, and when the
original expedition got back from Port Curtis, in
the neighborhood of ex-Prime Minister Fisher’s
electorate, it reckoned it had escaped out of Hell.
But Victoria was re-settled from Tasmania.
South Queensland was settled from N.S.W.
North Queensland was settled from South Queens-
land. And the Territory, even if the Common-
wealth doesn’t take it over, will presently be
settled from North Queensland and will start
afresh. It has really had hardly any worse luck
than Westralia, which mouldered and petrified
for 60 years, and was scarcely a yard further
ahead till the gold discoveries came along,
though the fact that Westralia was located on the
sea-road to Europe gave it a better chance than
the North ever had. And the fact that the
Territory has been losing population (Chinese
population) of late doesn’t seem any special reason
why the transcontinental railway should be taken
round West Queensland by a long circuit in the
neighborhood of Birdsville, where the population
dropped between the last census and the one
before from 77 to about nothing ; and Thargomin-
dah (which dropped from 338 people to 316—yet
Thargomindah is set down as quite an important
junction on the proposed eastern deviation).' Nor
does it seem a reason why it should go down
through western N.S.W., where almost every
county has been losing population, to connect
with the perishing town of Bourke, and the fading
town of Broken Hill, which the NT.S.W. State
Government has always held to be not worth the
price of railway communication while N.S.W. had
to pay the bill. Last of all, the fact that the Terri-
tory doesn’t show much growth of population is
hardly a reason why its railway, instead of having
its southern terminus in the vigorous and pro-
gressive State of S.A., should wander through a
part of Victoria which, under thecurseof the great
landlords and the incapacity of Premier John
Weary and his kind, has been losing people for
many years past.
As another side issue of the case, the ad vocates of
the eastern deviation, whereby the legal tender
of all Australia is to be put up to pay for 1793 miles
of State railway in Queensland and N.S.W. (mostly
in Queensland) point out that the two unfinished
fragments of the direct transcontinental line are
not paying properties. The northern fragment,
from Port Darwin to Pine Creek, covers 145 miles
of country and ends nowhere, and the passenger
train runs about once a week. The southern
fragment ends at Oodnadatta, which is almost
nowhere, and the regular passenger train runs
over the last section of this unfortunate enterprise
only once a fortnight. They are certainly two
lamentable railways, though their luck seems as
good as that of the average unfinished line which
ends nowhere. But at their worst they have paid
working expenses and something towards interest,
which is more than Victoria’s Penshurst-Dunkeld
and Lancefield-Kilmore and Outer Circle railways
did ; and more than N.S.W. can say of its
Narrandera-Finley or Clyde-Carlingford or (up to
1906) of its Blacktown-Richmond lines. It is even
more than Queensland can say of its Cooktown-
Laura railway. And though there is something
sad about a line where one train a week will carry
all the passengers offering, still it isn’t unique
in its way. Victoria decided that on its Penshurst-
Dunkeld line one train in eternity would be more
than enough, so it tore up the wretched thing.
On its Lancefield-Kilmore and Outer Circle rail-
ways it reckoned one train in five years a fair
deal, and it closed these enterprises for about
that time. And in N.S.W. the passenger train
to Bourke runs three times a week with a fairly
steady average of a single passenger—the writer
was once that passenger, and for about 100 miles
he had the whole train to himself ; and then the
lights went out, and in despair he got out at a
wayside station, where there was nobody
in sight, and finished the trip on the engine
for the sake of company. Yet one of the great
objects of the proposed costly deviation of the
transcontinental railway is to connect the Far
North with Bourke. And another object is to
connect with Broken Hill, where the train from
Sydney doesn’t run once in a century, because
Sydney always held that a railway in that
direction wouldn’t pay for axle-grease.
* ’•* * *
So far as things have gone there have been quite
a number of curiously deranged arguments ad-
vanced in favor of the proposal to change the
proposed railway through the Federally-owned
Northern Territory into a State railway (paid for
with the money of all Australia) for the chief
benefit of the East. Philip Ftsh, of Tasmania,
said that the heat of the Territory was so awful
that people were leaving. He didn’t show how a
deviation which would add several hundred miles
to the length of the transcontinental railway would
in any way diminish the heat. And McDonald, of
Queensland, evoked loud cheers by saying that it
would be ridiculous to build a transcontinental
railway on the narrow, inefficient 3ft. 6in. gauge
of South Australia. The statement was quite
true in one respect, for the 3ft. 6in. gauge is
a mere joke. But it was quite untrue in
another respect, for the 3ft. 6in. gauge is not
in any special sense the S.A. gauge. The
3ft. 6in. affair is the regulation Westralian
gauge; Westralia has about 1950 miles of
it. Also, it is the regulation Queensland
gauge ; in McDonald’s own State a cheap and
nasty railway system has about 3500 miles of the
wretched 3|tt. gauge which made McDonald
feel so bad. "But S.A. has only about 1280 miles
of the incompetent narrow gauge—about one-third
as much as Queensland possesses—and it has 600
miles of the smooth-running broad gauge (sft.
3in.), whereas Queensland hasn’t even a mile of
that. Therefore when McDonald, of Queensland,
clamoring for the building of a railway through
his own State at the expense of all Australia,
jeered at the inefficient line as “ the narrow
gauge of S. A.,” instead of calling it the toy gauge
of Queensland, he wasn’t playing the game as a
fair-minded man would have done. The proposed
eastern deviation of the transcontinental railway
would strike quite a lot of gauge problems. It
would connect with a 3ft. 6m. system in Queens-
land ; a 4ft. B|in. system in N.S.W., and a sft.
3in. system in Victoria. And what would come
of all these systems and variations the Lord only
knows.
* * * *
In this matter The Bulletin has no suspicion
that it is on the winning side. It holds a brief
for the empty spaces —for the regions where popu-
lation should be but isn’t. The empty spaces
have no voting power at the moment, so however
great may be their possibilities of wealth they
don’t count in the immediate scheme of things.
The question between the empty spaces and the
congested districts is the same as that between
Shoreditch (London) and Heaven. Shoreditch
has 100,000 or 120,000 people to the square mile,
and no one supposes Heaven to be so horribly con-
gested as that; therefore the voting power is with
Shoreditch. None the less, the future of this
country lies with the empty spaces, and there is a
certain satisfaction in holding a brief for them.
THE RECENT INVASION OF BRITAIN.
Britain was casually invaded the other day, and
though the deed was done in quite a friendly
manner, it was none the less significant. The
invasion was accomplished, too, by means against
which all the stupendous and money-swallowing
British fleet is quite powerless. A perfectly
casual Frenchman flew across from the Continent
in about 27 minutes, despite the fact that he
struck adverse weather on the road. That sort of
thing means that a fleet of aeroplanes, going back-
wards and forwards, could, if blessed with good
weather, deliver a fresh army in England every
hour or two, and deposit quite a respectable force
there in a couple of days, despite all the fleets that
ever patrolled the seas. Of course, the aeroplane
is in its infancy yet, and it isn’t up to now a carrier
of artillery or heavy goods, and it will probably
require a few more years of improvement and de-
velopment before it becomes a serious factor in war.
Still, the event was another jolt to the already
jangled nerves of J. Bull. He has pinned all his
faith to his capacity for keeping inviolate the
silver streak that lies between him and continental
Europe. He has even refused to permit the con-
struction of the Channel tunnel, which would be a
source of food supply supposing the ordinary
means of sea communication went wrong. If the
silver streak goes out of his possession, he says
very freely that his glory will be up a tree.
(And incidentally, if J. Bull goes up a tree,
Australia does the same, unless it gives up the
dreadful habit of wasting six months in keeping
Parliament shut because the Ministry is afraid to
face the House, and a lot more time in fixing up
a disreputable Fusion, and three weeks or so
over a motion of censure, and six hours in debating
whether members should or should not be allowed
to put cross-headings on the printed reports of
their speeches, and an indefinite period in trying
to bend the transcontinental line around so that it
will go through the back-yards of the largest
possible number of the Fused party’s sup-
porters—unless it gives up these follies and
gives serious attention to questions of Aus-
tralian development and defence.) J. Bull
is so weak on land, through his refusal to
adopt the principle of universal military train-
ing, that he professes to see no hope of holding
his islands against an invading force of any size
and value. And he has so killed off local agricul-
ture by his policy of free imports that he is
driven to admit that, in case of a serious invasion,
he would probably be starved into surrender
before he had time to create a real army. There-
fore he depends wholly and completely to
his naval supremacy, and certain things worry
him. The submarine and the aeroplane have
lately arrived. If they are, or if they develop
into, the deadly things that many people imagine,
then all the Great Powers are starting again
from scratch, and the laboriously-compiled naval
supremacy of the past is as nought.
• * * *
An ordinary sort of Great Power, if placed in
Great Britain’s geographical position, might
take the matter philosophically. If an
attack came it would meet the enemy
with its fleet, supposing the fleet happened to be
sufficiently concentrated. Supposing it found
itself to be getting the worst of the contest, it
would bolt early for a fortified harbor, and save
its naval power to cut off the invader’s retreat and
to prevent him getting reinforcements. It might
even be conceivable, under certain circumstances,
that its fleet would refuse to argue the point at all
with the invader —that it would deliberately let
him land, and devote itself to intercepting his re-
inforcements and cutting off his retreat. When the
invader landed his troubles would be only begin-
ning. The armed and trained male populace,
perhaps 3,000,000 strong, would extend to him the
right hand of welcome—with a gun in it. He
w r ould fall, every hero and there, over strongly
fortified towns, which he would have to take
before he could progress further. Because the
country grew its own food it wouldn’t be distressed
in its stomach by a blockade. Moreover, the
fleet would be comparatively intact, not
having gambled away its entire strength in one
great effort to resist invasion, and that being so,
the invader would not dare to disperse his naval
force to blockade a multitude of ports and shut
out the provision supply. In any case, if a
country grew its own food there would be no sense
or benefit in blockading its ports to shut out the
provision supply.
* * * *
But the situation of Britain is peculiar. (1) It
has no fortified places which would detain an in-
vader. (2) It has very little in the way of an
army. (3) The decay of its agriculture and its
almost complete dependence on foreign food sup-
plies make it the most helpless place in all the
world if its oversea supplies happened to be cut off.
Britain is up against a curious combination of cir-
cumstances. It depends on a voluntary army, and
as it has to pay a considerable figure in order to
attract soldiers, even though its soldiers represent
in many cases the mere sediment of the people, its
troops cost, for wages and maintenance, £IOO a
year per man; whereas the trained citizen-soldier
of Switzerland costs only £8 per year. Conse-
quently, Britain has an amazingly small army,
and about the biggest military bill on earth. Its
army being so small it has to maintain a gigantic
and bloated navy; consequently its bill for sea
defence is the biggest in the world. Owing to its
Freetrade ideals, there is no serious attempt to
make the importer of foreign goods pay these
bills, so they have to be mostly paid by direct
taxation, and the next thing is that the direct
taxation per head in Britain is the heaviest on the
globe. Then the British farmer, as a rule, doesn’t
own his bit of land, but is a mere tenant; and
when he has paid his rent, and paid the heaviest
direct taxation on earth, he finds he can’t com-
pete with the imported grain of the foreigner
who owns his farm, pays no rent, and isn’t hit in
the stomach with so overwhelming a tax bill. So
the British farmer gives up the struggle and the
ghost; and his land becomes, in many cases, a
preserve for game, and the man who profits most
by this state of things—the trader or importer or
financier-rents it for shooting purposes at a
figure which would kill the unprotected and
highly-taxed farmer dead.
* * * *
This sort of situation naturally makes Bull
nervous. He recognises that quite a moderate
force of well-armed and highly-trained men might
suffice to wipe out his little garrison of very
expensive voluntary soldiers, who are by no
means the best physical specimens of the com-
munity. If such a force just happened through
in a fog or some such circumstance, the enemy
wouldn’t even require the command of the sea in
order to starve Britain into surrender, and pos-
sibly into handing over its fleet. A few
batteries and sunken ships would block the
lower Thames and prevent food reaching London
by sea, and the wrecking of a few railways would
cut it off by land ; and then the centre of the
Empire would have to make the best terms it
could, or else take to cannibalism. The lack of
an effective army, the lack of local food supplies,
the lack of fortified places to detain an invader,
and the concentration of nearly 7,000,000 people
and all the machinery of government in one
place where the pressure of hunger could be so
easily turned on, are circumstances which fill
British military and naval authorities with undis-
guised uneasiness. If Britain lost command of
the sea, said Admiral Beresford, “ it would be
good-night.” And lately Admiral FINNIS talked
of the possible downfall of Britain if even 70,000
good soldiers were landed on its shores; also he
stated that, in the course of some casual manoeuvres
in which he represented the attacking force, he
dodged the defenders in a fog, and if he had
been a real assailant he professes to believe that he
could have landed the force described without any
difficulty. Even Premier Asquith has lately dis-
coursed in much the same strain. Either the
danger is very real or else the British nation has,
to some extent, lost its nerve.
* * * *
The problem that troubles Britain to-day is
something more than the maintenance of


the two-Power naval standard. Seeing that
the country has gambled practically every-
thing on sea defence, it becomes rather a
question of having so many ships afloat that
by no accident of fog or storm or surprise,
or the mere happening of a dark night, can it
miss its enemy, and even a ten-Power standard
might, under certain conditions, fail to fill the
bill. It is not wonderful that under the circum-
stances J. 801 l should view Australasia’s offer of
two Dreadnoughts with ill-concealed disgust. He
has quite enough Dreadnoughts to beat the
enemy if he happens to meet him at the right
time ; but if he doesn’t happen to meet him at the
right time, 20 more Dreadnoughts make no differ-
ence. Meanwhile there is a feeling that the
acceptance of these gifts would bind him in
honor to defend Australia and Maoriland against
a possible invader, and he isn’t looking for new
obligations of that kind. He has enough on his
mind already. A person with such responsibilities
doesn’t want to be distracted at a crisis by Willt
Kelly hanging on to his coat-tail, and crying for
assistance for a place 12,000 miles away, and
reminding him that he helped, to present Bull
with one ship at some foolish long-forgotten date.
So the London Times rose up again last week
and implored these countries to cease poking
Dreadnoughts at their aged parent, and to attend
instead to their own defence. To which Joseph
Ward, of Maoriland, replied that his loyalty was
so unquenchable that he would continue to shove
a ship at Old Mother whether she wanted it or
not.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Lagging Parliament.
The unseemly and bad-tempered row over the
right of members to put cross-headings on their
reprinted speeches occupied nearly six hours of
the time of the House of Representatives one
night last week. And it was only one in a terrace
of foolish shindies with which business has been
obstructed of late. Despite all the odor of iniquity
which attaches to the Dicakin-Cook Fusion, this
sort of thing is very poor policy. In the first
place, it establishes a precedent which the Fused
party will joyfully seize upon when it is in Oppo-
sition (next year) to prevent the Democrats doing
business. In the second place, it demoralises the
House and accustoms members to be foolish, can-
tankerous, long-winded, and addicted to pottering
round volubly after small things, and being too
tired to take any interest in large ones ; and when
the Labor men come into office they will find
that sort of House very difficult to manage.
Lynk and Webster and other voluminous persons
have got so much in the road that the Fusion
hasn’t had a fair chance to reveal its incapacity.
There is reason to believe that, if the Fusion gets
a show, it will go to the country convicted of pro-
found imbecility in a multitude of affairs. It will
be a grievous pity if it is prevented from revealing
the full measure of its unwisdom. The motion of
censure was bad tactics to begin with ; it gave the
Ministry three weeks in which to find a policy.
The attempts to snatch casual victories over small
things are still worse tactics. In a case like the
present the Opposition should have lain back, and
thus compelled the Government to introduce its
big measures, and thereby explain how many of its
alleged principles it had sacrificed for office ; or
else to reveal its ineptitude by filling up its time
with matters of no importance. If the Fusion has
a chance to go to the country as a Ministry
which has been prevented by obstruction from
fully unfolding its splendid policy, instead
of as one which was given every opportunity
to show its mental barrenness, it may win the
battle after all. The 10 hours or so which
Webster, M.H.R., devoted to making an exhibi-
tion of himself would have been much better spent
in giving the Fused people a chance to make an
exhibition of themselves. Since the awful Dread-
nought fiasco, and the practical abandonment of
the idea of compulsory military training, the Minis-
try doesn’t know where it stands in the matter of
Defence, and every hour of foolish copiousness on
the part of men like Webster gives it more time
to scramble together some semblance of a plan.
Since its abandonment of the graduated land-tax
and of any idea of imposing new duties, and since
its wild promise to deal liberally with the State
Governments, its financial prospects have been
chaos, and the censure motion gave it nearly a
month in which to scratch its head and devise plaus-
ible explanations. It ought to be in the middle of
its borrowing policy by this time and having a
shockingly bad experience over it; but it has been
furnished with a fair excuse so far for avoiding
the painful subject. Obstruction very seldom
pays, and in the present case it looks specially
unprofitable. And the methods adopted must
have caused serious wear and tear to William
Lyne, who seems hardly to have calmed down
once since the session commenced.

Tlie “Brisbane Worker” and its “Shocking
Revelation.”
The following extract, taken from the Catholic
Press (Sydney) of 5/8/’O9, speaks for itself: —
THE “BRISBANE WORKER’S” SHOCKING
. REVELATION.
Slandering “The Bulletin.”
Under the heading of “ A Shocking Revelation,” an
article appeared a couple of weeks ago in the Brisbane
Worker, in which it was stated :
“People who wondered why Sydney Bulletin so sud-
denly ceased its condemnations of the Kid-Philp coalition
need wonder no longer. A question asked and answered
in the Queensland Assembly last week has solved the
mystery. The sum of £2O per issue for 12 months is
being ladled out to the red-faced Bully for advertising
the advantages of this State as a field for settlement. Just
prior to the fixing up of the contract The Bulletin, in
the excess of its disgust at Kidstoh’s coalition conduct,
had declared it wouldn’t be found dead in the same pad-
dock with him. And those who still retained faith in the
democracy of the great Protectionist organ that is
printed on Freetrade paper, rejoiced exceedingly thereat.
With the formidable Bully on their side, they felt that
the coalition would soon receive its quietus. But, alas!
a change came o’er the spirit of their dream ! The Bully’s
denunciations of Kidston’s treachery suddenly petered
out. A deathly silence about the coalition pervaded its
columns all at once.”
This article was reprinted without comment in the
Catholic Press. We find now that the Worker’s charge
is absolutely without foundation, and we very much
regret the republication of the article, and take this op-
portunity to unreservedly apologise for any reflection
cast on the reputation of The Bulletin.
The Bulletin points out that it never made any con-
tract with the Coalition Government, that its contract
was dated three months before the Coalition took place ;
that when it denounced the Kidston-Philp Government
it was denouncing a profitable advertiser, and that not
only was it not paid in any way to ceaseits hostility to the
Queensland Coalition, but that a perusal of its pages
would show that its hostility had never ceased. The
Worker story it denounces as a complete fabrication.
Oil inspecting the documents, the Catholic Press finds
that the Bulletin’s account of the circumstances is ab-
solutely correct.
The Clerks’ Union and its Troubles.
A deputation representing the N.S.W. Clerks’
Union waited last week on Premier G-. Wade, and
once more asked thatstupendous potentate to allow
the pen-drivers to shelter under the Industrial
Disputes Act. The essence of Wade’s reply is
contained in the following hunk of the morning
paper. (Wade’s numerous and dreary references
to the clerks’ want of respect have been hewn off
along with other verbiage; the extracts given
below, therefore, represent Wade compressed—so
far as that process can be applied to him): —
Before any such sweeping alteration as was asked in the
Act was made, two things were desirable —first, to show
that there was what he might call more than spasmodic
ill-treatment of clerical employees ; second, that there
was a genuine feeling amongst the general body of clerks
that they should come under the operation of the Act.
He had not treated the matter with a deaf ear, and his
inquiries so far went to show that, as in all walks of life,
some employers did not treat their employees fairly ; but
as far as he could find out, as a general rule, the evil was
by no means of the intensity it was painted.
The same remark has been made about the Devil.
However, that didn’t empty the cupboard where
Wade keeps his platitudes on ice :
Further, communications had been sent to him, in the
shape of requests from clerks in Sydney, expressing their
objections to being placed under a Board ; that they saw
no reason for it under the conditions they enjoyed, and
that they feared that being brought under the operation
of the Act had not so much for its object the securing of
further benefits for them as, they feared, for the purpose
of unionising the clerks of the State, and using the union
for political purposes. He was not going to pass an
opinion on that, but those objections had been made,
and he felt it to be his duty t<> make inquiries. He was
now endeavoring to find out, first, how far the request of
the union emanated from the general body of clerks ;
and, second, how far their conditions were of an unfair
character.
The first thing that strikes one, hereabouts, is that
the alleged alarm of Wade’s clerk friends that
they may be used for political purposes is as
nothing to the alarm of Wade lest that political
purpose should prove to be not his purpose, but
the other fellow’s. So Wade is going to find out
whether the clerks really want a union and a
Wages Board. That work ought to be beautifully
simple. It was recently announced in the press
that many clerks were signing a petition
against the Wages Board idea, it being
broadly hinted to them that if they didn’t
sign the sack might be the alternative.
If Wade’s agent picks his offices carefully, and
gets the boss to go round with him when he asks
questions, he will probably be able to come back
and state truthfully that he has interrogated some
hundreds of clerks in a dozen or more offices and
found them unanimously opposed to the Wages
Board proposal and the Clerks’ Union and the
whole job and business generally. It should be as
easy as falling down dead.
The Dishonest Anti-Socialist Female
Conferencer.
The “Women’s Anti-Socialistic Conference”
opened at Brisbane (3/8/’O9), and the delegates at
once proceeded, according to the S. M. Herald
of the following day, to get these futilities off
their bosoms:—
Mrs. Hopk said that under Socialism our will was
cribbed and confined. She believed in humanitarian
laws, but not in the economic conditions of modern
Socialism.
Mrs. Moseley said that the difference between
Christian Socialism and modern Socialism lay in the fact
that the former meant self-denial and the latter sacrifice
of others.
Mrs. Jenkins said they had had a bitter lesson in
Socialism durinsr the recent tramway strike in New
South Waies. Girls had to tramp through the rain to
work.
Mrs. Mackinnon urged that the brain was the founda-
tion of success. Socialism meant drawing' down instead
of levelling up.
Mrs. Edgley expressed her conviction that with Social-
ism there could be no thrift; for, should a man begin to
save, it. would alter the conditions of equality, and there
would again have to be a redistribution.
There was a lot more, and it was all the same,
and all powerfully suggestive of the ancient
query : Can a female Anti-Socialist who goes con-
ferencing possess a fragment of honesty in the
neighborhood of her false front? When G.
Reid made his last furious dash for office,
some three years ago, he adopted as a
basic campaign-lie the contention that the
Australian Labor Party was composed of
whole hog Karl Marx Socialists. He made public
calculation of the exact number of quadrillions of
sovereigns that would be required to be raised by
Government, in order to buy out every lolly shop,
oyster saloon and whelk-stall in the Common-
wealth—laying it down that the forcible resump-
tion and management of these concerns by the
State must be a first result of the rise to power
of his opponents. He drew terrific work-pictures
of the levelling down processes that would occur
if he were defeated —of well-to-do industrious folk
•being forced to pool their honestly-acquired gains,
and share and share alike with idle wastrels; of
children being seized by State officials and marked
for identification with numbers instead of names,
and a host of other asininities of the sort.
It is charitable to credit Reid with believing in a
proportion of this nonsense at the start. It has
always been his sloppy way to butt into things
with the scantiest stock of exact knowledge in
regard to the same, and rely on picking up the
missing information as he goes along. In any
case, he abandoned, after a time, the more
grotesque of his Anti-Sosh arguments ; and they
were heard no more in the land so far as he and
his parliamentary followers were concerned. In
fact, numbers of anti-Socialists have been blush-
ing for quite a long time now anent the foolish
lies they heaved at their leader’s Tiger in the long
ago. They want their past declarations that the
return of the Laborites to power involves the
bursting of home and the marriage-tie, and
Anarchy generally, consigned to the same place
of forgetfulness where Joe Cook is hoping his
arguments against an Australian navy may be
interred, and where Willy Kelly hankers to
see his one-time clamors in opposition to com-
pulsory training at rest. No qualms of this des-
cription trouble, however, the females who attend
“Women’s ‘Anti-Socialistic’Conferences.” They
alone of all their kind persist in whipping the
dead cat of Communism and calling it the policy of
the Labor Party. They are able to read their
daily papers, and so it is impossible to believe
that they don’t know any better. They cannot
help but realise that nothing in the Labor
Party’s programme makes for the “cribbing
and confining” of people’s “wills”; also they
must appreciate that the N.S.W. tramway strike
had no earthly connection with Sosh, and that a
Fisher Ministry might be in power for an un-
limited period without dreaming of “ redis-
tributing ” people’s savings. These are the worn
old gags of the early and darkest age of anti-
Socialism—yarns that have been dropped over-
board long since by the rest of the anti-Labor
crew as too silly and unsavory for human con-
sumption. Yet they continue good enough for
tiie women who sit in conference annually. The
affluent and well-dressed anti-Socialist woman
represents about the lowest point to which the
white person’s intelligence has reached. The
average corporation laborer or kitchen-maid leaves
her miles behind in political and economical
knowledge. But if her knowledge is small, her
disregard for the truth and her utter lack of any
idea of the rudiments of fair-play are stupendous,
and, as the stupendous thing sort of balances the
very small thing, affairs are pretty even in the
end.

Concerning' Tramps, Freetrade and Otherwise.
Two or three decades ago the U.S. tramp started
to loom large in British comic papers and on the
British music-hall stage. He was, like many
another article, an import; but his scrubby beard,
long matted hair and aspect of utter destitution
soon familiarised him to the people of the United
Kingdom. The Freetrader, avid for arguments
on behalf of his bursting cause, seized on the U.S.
tramp, and exploited him as a Horrible Example
of the effect of Protective tariffs. It, was urged
that, owing to Protectionism, the U.S. was his
country of origin and natural home, and his burst
tall hat and ruined frock coat became institutions.
Britain, with its happy, contented yeomanry and
prosperous farming class and resultant lack of
pauper undesirables, was represented to be quite
a different place. But the London Daily Mail
wades in (26/6/’O9) and gives the show away thus :
There has converged by all roads upon Maldon this
summer a horde of the unemployed, who by some means
or other discovered the chance of earning a few shillings
at pea-picking. Many have come from workhouses far
and near, and, as events have proved, are of the very
lowest human scale.
The rush began about three weeks ago, with the speedy
consequence that the casual ward at Maldon Workhouse
was crowded out. With something like 500 applications
for relief the position at last became so acute that the
guardians were compelled to seek the services of a local
contractor, who is now housing between 100 and 200 of
the nomads in a shed at fourpence a head per night.
This aroused great indignation among the ratepayers,
but the abject wretchedness of the pickers would have
softened hearts but for the tales of pillage and insult
which have come from many quarters.
A gentleman who lives at Wickham, about three miles
from Maldon, informed me to-day that in all parts of the
locality the tramps have been begging food at the cot-
tages and frightening the women with their gruff
presence and insulting demands. At Cold Norton a
similar story was told me at the local hostel. On Mr.
Hollinaton’s farm, near Woodham Ferris, after breaking
the lock of a fowlhouse door, a tramp took the eggs from
under a sitting hen.
Everywhere I went in the Maldon district yesterday I
met hungry-looking men and tired women soaked to the
skin through their rags of clothing. They had been
soaked for hours, probably for days. The mystery is,
where do they all sleep? Black patches by the sides of
the lanes tell of their camp fires, and it is certain that
many of them sleep on the roadside. In the Norton
neighborhood women as well as men have-been found fast
asleep under the hedgerows.
All the farmers agree that a fair percentage of the un-
fortunate persons are yearning for honest work.
This betrays an appalling state of affairs in the
Freetrade human destitution line. The Yankee
tramp has ever been an unemployable for the
most part—a genial languid vagabond whose
wanderings are undertaken more with the object
of evading than finding toil. Temperament is
mostly responsible for him. His British equiva-
lent is a pauper of another variety. In fact, it
may be laid down as an axiom that one of the
clear-cut distinctions between the protected
countries and the United Kingdom, nowadays, is
that in the former the tramp is rare, and where
he does occur he spends most of his time fleeing
from the job which offers with a sickening per-
sistency; while in the latter he pervades the
country side in battalions, and chases work from
dawn till dark, in no dilettante fashion, but rather
with an axe.
The Tariff and the Cupboard.
“Jason” spends an evening with the domestic
balance-sheet :
I’m getting: tired of the eternal whine about the cost
of living and the tariff, and I w'ant to put forward niy
experiences in the matter. Three years ago l left a billet
in Melbourne, where I had lived all my life, to come to
Sydney, having been offered a salary 20 per cent, larger
than the one I had been paid in the south. I re-
ceived a warning from a friend already settled here not
to be scared when the first week’s bills came in, but I
thought it ridiculous that there could be any great
difference between the two cities, and came over. Since
that date I have iust contrived to scrape along, in spite
of my 20 per cent, increase, though I have received
additions to my earnings. In Melbourne I saved money.
Here in Sydney I find it impossible to put anything by,
and it takes me all my time to keep up my life insurance.
So much for the facts. Now, for the analysis. I had
always thought the Melbourne landlord a monopolist and
a grinder of the faces of the poor ; but I’ll never say a
word against him again. He is a philanthropist of the
most benevolent character as compared with the Sydney
article. A house, three miles from the city, which would
cost £1 weekly in Melbourne, you cannot get for 255.
here ; and, when you add the cost of travelling, the
difference is staggering. In Melbourne I travelled by train,
first-class, for 10s. monthly. The journey occupied 12
minutes. I went home to lunch and went to town at night.
Here I have to pay 3d. a trip on a tram that rattles so
loudly that you can’t speak to your neighbor, and shakes
so much that reading means a dog and a collection-box
in a few years. If I travelled here as much as I did in
Melbourne I should pay 10s. weekly instead of monthly.
The next item is food. For some extraordinary reason, I
find that in every line Sydney prices exceed those of
Melbourne. Fruit is almost prohibitive, although the
County of Cumberland is an infinitely better fruit-
growing area than the County of Bourke. Eating vege-
tables is like eating money, owing largely to the fact that
Sydney has not yet got wholly out of its importing craze,
and is still content to consume the green stuff brought
from 500 miles away. The excess differs according to
different lines ; but, on the whole, the price of fruit and
vegetables in Sydney is nearly double that of Melbourne.
Meat, strangely enough, is also slightly dearer here,
though half the meat consumed in Melbourne comes in
the first instance from New' South Wales ; milk is about
the same ; butter jigs about so much in both places that
it is impossible to make a comparison ; eggs never in the
history of Victoria reached the price they have been in
Sydney for the past six months, and the average must be
fully 2d. a dozen higher. Clothing is the one commodity'
that is alw'ays trotted out by' the Foreign-trader when the
tariff is mentioned, though clothing is a very small
matter in the total cost of living. And, after all, cloth-
ing in Sydney is no cheaper than in Melbourne, and
unless you go to some trouble in ascertaining the right
places it is much dearer, owing to the systematic boy-
cott of Australian-made goods by the vast majority of
the Sydney shopkeepers. A man can go into almost any
shop in Melbourne and get locally’-produced articles at a
fair price. In Sydney, if he asks for Australian goods he
gets no satisfaction, but, as often as not, insulting remarks
are thrown at him by the shopkeeper. The tariff may
have raised the cost of clothing in Sydney ; but it cer-
tainly did not raise the price of foodstuffs. Even if the
tariff did increase the cost of clothes, how is it that the
man getting £2 weekly in Melbourne is still, with the
same tariff, almost as well off as the man getting £3
weekly in Sydney? What Sydney wants is a Royal Com-
mission to go into the whole question of food supply, and
burst up the Trusts now con trolling it; and along with that
it wants a complete railway system that would reduce fares
and the freight of building materials. Likewise, it wants
more retail shops where Australians can buy Australian
goods.
The Hope of the Empty North.
“ Larkakkyah” writes from Pt. Darwin (N.T.): —
“Northerner” recently told The Bulletin that the
Chow was still slowly shouldering the white man out of
the Northern Territory. He isn’t. The white man here
is slowly but surely coming into his own. I have lived
here (N.T.) for two years, and I see the change. I know
of three recent contracts let to white men, not because
they were white men, but because the Chows’ tenders
were higher. In one case it was—White, 9d.; Yellow,
3s. 6d. But, apart from questions of cost, the white is
getting a preference which he didn’t get once. I know
another contract let to him though the Chows’ price was
lower. In 1907 the population of the Territory was
Males. Females.
Europeans .. 808 .. 302
Chinese.. .. 1770 .. 03
Others .. .. 195 .. 28
The European population has been greater only three
times in 27 years ; the Chinese population is lower than
it has ever been since 1881. The figures for 1908 are not
available here yet; but the best authorities tell me
that the white population is growing, and the yellow
ditto shrinking. We are waking up. For years
the case seemed hopeless, and the N.T. man let
things go. He chose-the easy way. Now he sees a
ray of light ahead, and begins to do his part. I know of
more than one case where the Chow' has been sacked to
make way for a white man at higher wages. I know of
mine-owners who would shout all round if they were in
a position to employ only white miners. But again and
again they are faced with this alternative—experienced
Chow miner or totally inexperienced white who isn’t a
miner. The southern enemy of the white man says
that w’e have employed Chows because we knew
that only the Chow could do the w'ork in this
climate. It is not true. But so long as Australia took
no practical interest in the Territory, so long as it show'ed
no concern about keeping it white, we naturally were
very little concerned either. Australia has been in the
habit of throwing scorn at the N.T. for its friendly deal-
ings with the Chow. But when Australia shows us that
we have something else to hope for, it will find that the
few w’hite people of the Northern Territory have just as
healthy White Australia ideals as the rest of the con-
tinent.
“ J.G.”: In 1892 the Victorian Government of
the day, yielding to the pressure of the local
M’sL.A., backed up by the promises of the
squatters and cookies (mostly squatters), built a
railway between Lancefield and Kilmore. It cost a
barrel of money, as the line was taken through
difficult country, nearly on top of the dividing
range, and it was as crooked as a ram’s horn for
pretty w'ell the whole 16 miles. But the squatters
and cookies promised that all their produce and
stock would be sent over the new line if it
were built, so the great work was done.
Then the value of the squatters and cbckies’
land for miles around made a bound up-
wards of several pounds per acre. But instead
of sending their stuff over the new line, the spud
and oat growers carted their produce by road
either to Kilmore or Lancefield, and the squatters
travelled their jumbucks and bullocks by road
alongside the line, instead of putting them on the
trucks to help the railway earn a speck of revenue.
The line was kept open for about five years, the
mere working expenses amounting to over £IOOO
ayear, whilst the total revenue wasabout£lso. The
station buildings, grain sheds, sheep yards
and races along the track began to fall to
pieces, because they were never used, except
by a few deadbeats and some ’possums and
rabbits. Meanwhile the interest bill was
met by the suffering taxpayer. At last
the Government took its courage in both
hands, and closed the extraordinary show. Then
the local cookies and squatters kicked up the
Devil’s own row about the “ shameful breach of
contract,” and the ruination of the farmers. The
line remained closed for about three years, and
all that time the district clamored. In the end
the Government.resumed business, and ran a train
each way one day a week to see if the traffic had in-
creased any. But the squatters, cookies and other
shriekers still stuck to the road, and in a few months
the line was again closed, this time with a bang.
Now it is wisely proposed that the wretched
speculation should be dragged up by the roots and
the materials used elsewhere ; but not only do the
local landowners repel the idea with much riot,
At Duty’s Call.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
H.M.S. Powerful, the flag-ship of the Australian station,
with his Excellency Vice-Adiniral Sir Richard Poore and
staff on board, left Farm Cove at 2.30 p.tn. yesterday for
Brisbane. The visit to Brisbane is being made in con-
nection with the approaching Jubilee celebrations. The
Powerful is expected to return to Sydney about the
middle of September in time for the A.J.C. Spring
Meeting.— News Item.
When the westerlies have vanished, and the rain ;
And the pleasant summer season dawns again,
With its heat and flies and bees,
And its plague-afflicted fleas,
Then, in company with these,
Hark ! On all sides there ascends the joyous
strain
“Our defenders are approaching o’er the main.”
Lo ! they swoop like vikings on our lonely strand;
As the strident bray of a Teutonic band
Indicates the circumstance
That some “small and early ” dance
(A preliminary prance)
Looms. And straight each Loyalist yells, hat in
hand,
“They’ve come ! We’re safe ! ! Hooray !! !
Lord, ain’t it Grand ! ”
At the first day’s meeting of the A.J.C.
See them charge the pencillers, intrepidly ;
Taking long, aye ! hopeless odds,
With the dauntlessness of gods ;
Note, likewise, the bookies’ nods
And their smiles. They’re glad. They’ve ev’ry
cause to be.
It’s a case with them of easy £ s. d.
As the sun sinks slowly in the golden west
Our protectors hurry shipwards, and get dressed
(Not that they weren’t clad before.
As a fact, none goes ashore
From a warship without more
Clothes or less on); but the tar would earn arrest
Who fared forth at night in aught but evening
vest.
For Australia and the Empire they go out
To parties, where they dance and sing and shout.
And play bridge, pi'cquet and pool,
Poker, and, perchance, the fool;
Next repair where drinks are cool;
Then, to bed, convinced that, without any doubt,
They have saved the Commonwealth from shame
and rout.
Thus their useful toil proceeds day after day,
Till the Governor decides to end his stay :
The big houses are shut up
Where, erstwhile, iced fizz and “cup ”
Flowed, for all the fleet to sup.
Matters, socially, aren’t any longer gay :
So our guardians pack their clothes and steam
away.

Two clever articles in the August Lone
Hand show that the best brains of Australia are
busy over the Defence problem. And quickened
by judicious applications of D.C.L., the whisky of
the wise, they must reduce that problem to one
word —population. Add the word land, and you
have the necessary magic for conjuring the country
into prosperity and safety. Progress laughs
itself into prosperity at the merry twinkle from
the amber eye of the scholarly brand.*
they even demand the restoration of a regular
train service. Yet in the old days the blessed
train often trotted the whole way without a single
human being inside.

This comes from a contributor who says he was
born in the Canberra (N.S.W.) district over 60
years ago, and has spent most of his life back and
forth between there and the Victorian border —he
writes from a tiny (in fact, almost invisible) town-
ship in the Canberra district: —
If Canberra is decided upon as the Federal capital site,
then Provincialism will have perpetrated one of the
greatest jobs recorded in Australian history. In the year
1839 the Murrumbidgee River at the confluence of the
Queanbeyan River was a chain of waterholes only ; and
very many times since it has only run enough to swear
by. From a point 20 miles below this confluence to
within a few miles of Coonia, the country consists of a
rotten porous granite formation, and it has always been
the opinion of many local men that this basin is one of
the sources of our artesian supply. Be that as it may,
the fact remains that nearly a third of the water which
passes Cooma is lost before it reaches the point men-
tioned, and the Bredbo and Umeralla rivers, which are
strong running streams further up, dwindle to a trickle
before reaching the Murrumbidgee. The above state-
ment also applies to the Queanbeyan River, which is often
a mere thread of w'ater. The Cotter, from which the
Federal capital is to be supplied, has a very small dry
catchment area, and has a very small and wholly inade-
quate trickle of water. If Mr. db Burgh’s recent state-
ment had applied to any year save one of very heavy
rainfall like the present, it would have been plain lying.
♦
The manufacturing business in Victoria seems to
be mostly going the right way. The thing to be
aimed at is high efficiency along with high wages;
and that bull’s-eye is being hit. According to last
year’s factory figures, just produced by Govern-
ment Statist Laughton, £6,380,296 was paid in
wages, or 33 per cent, more than in 1904 ; yet the
hands employed have only increased by 23 per
cent. Thus there has been alO per cent, rise in
wages beyond what would be accounted for by the
increase in the number of hands. Yet, though the
wages have increased like that, the total wages
haven’t increased in proportion to the value of the
output. Wages totalled 20’7 per cent, of the total
value in 1904, and it was exactly the same last
year ; which means, apparently, that the efficiency
of the work people has increased along with their
wages. This probably is to some extent due to
the growth of the factories themselves : 37’9 per
cent, of all the hands are now employed in factor-
ies with over 100 employees ; whereas in 1904 only
33’7 per cent, were in these big mills. But if
wages don’t take any bigger bite out of the value
of the manufactures than they did in 1904, fuel
and light and materials do ; in these items
the jump in four years has been from 59’4
per cent, to 62’4 per cent. In 1904, 19D per
cent, of the value was left for the manufac-
turer to pay miscellaneous expenses and pro-
vide his own profit; to-day only 16’9 per cent, is
left. So the men who supply the materials charge
exactly 3 per cent, more than they did in 1904 ;
and the manufacturers have exactly 3 per cent,
less for miscellaneous expenses and profits. There
is a vague idea floating around that, through
Wages Boards, etc., labor has been filling its
pockets at the expense of the manufacturer ; but
these figures show that, though there is certainly
less left for the manufacturer, the whole of the
falling-off is due to the heavier demands made on
hitn by the coal cos. which supply fuel, the cattle-
breeder and the fellmonger who supply hides and
leather, the squatter who supplies wool, the co.
which supplies timber, the farmer who supplies
straw, and other similar people who mostly have
been heaving bricks at “ the rapacity of the
working classes.”
The Melbourne Hospital, and the Eye and Ear
institution in the same city, issue most depressing
balance-sheets, and doubtless others of their kind
will follow. The Melbourne Hospital has a short-
age for the year of £4436. and the Eye and Ear
has a new shortage of £560 and an old one of
£3633. The foolish niggardliness of the Govern-
ment is the main trouble. Melbourne Hospital
costs about £30,000 a year to run, and the cost
keeps increasing, partly because population in-
creases ; partly because the Government’s railway
policy is directed to crowding as much as possible
of the population into Melbourne, where it is
right at the Hospital’s door ; and partly because
the Government’s insane land policy is driving
the young men out of the country, and Victoria’s
population becomes constantly older and more
toothless in the aggregate, and more in
need of medical treatment. The Government
gives £IO,OOO a year towards the big hospital, and
the other £20,000 has to be cadged. As the
Government can collect its revenue so cheaply
that only 3 per cent, of the proceeds need go in
expenses, while in the cadging process about 20
per cent, often has to go in expenses, it is obvious
that the cadge device is terribly wasteful, as well
as unreliable. It also keeps a lot of people
collecting when they might be doing some pro-
ductive work, and it wastes the time of business
men in the process of dunning for subscriptions.
When the shiftless Ministry notes these simple
points it will probably make the big hospitals
State concerns pure and simple, but if it doesn’t
note them with reasonable speed Melbourne may
yet witness the amazing spectacle of the beds
in one of its big infirmaries being seized by the
bailiff.

The Victorian Supreme Court the other day
“sanctioned the reduction of the Zinc Corpora-
tion’s capital by writing off 4s. from each ordinary
share.” The Courts have done the same thing
probably a dozen times before ; but it is about
time they seriously considered whether they ever
ought to do it again. The whole busines is really
a sham. The alleged reduction makes the balance-
sheet look respectable in the eyes of the public,
no doubt; but while there is a cleaning-up on the
surface, for practical purposes there isn’t any
cleaning-up whatever underneath, because for
purposes of dividends —
The capital paid up on such shares shall be deemed to
be the sum of £1 per share [and not 16s.], notwith-
standing any reduction in the co.’s capital ;
and in the event of liquidation—
The nominal amount of each of such ordinary shares
shall be deemed to be the sum of £l, notwithstanding
any reduction in the co.’s capital.
So, following a bad old practice, the Court is
simply made use of to sanction a reduction of
capital which is, for practical purposes, a hollow
pretence ; and, as remarked before, it is about
time Courts decided that they won t allow them-
selves to be used to give their blessing to mere
window-dressing transactions of this sort.
The annual report of the Government Resident
in the Northern Territory contained a significant
passage:—
The question of to-day, however, is not that of checking
the loss of population caused by the departure of a few
score of Chinese coolies, important as that is in itself:
but the paramount national need for the early introduc-
tion of many thousands of Europeans to people this
territory, whose present insignificant population tends
but to emphasise its emptiness. This urgent need can
best be accomplished by a system of steady and con-
tinuous immigration, limited only by the means at the
disposal of the controlling power,, and directed towards
land settlement.
“ The loss of population caused by the departure
of a few score of Chinese coolies, important as that
is ” —the words are pathetic. They are the soul-
cry of a big, empty, fertile land ; a land so
clamorous for development that even the lessening
Chow coolie is to be regretted—for at least the
Chow did some development. Also the words are
one huge, withering anathema on the politicians
who won’t get along with their work, and give the
hungry Northland a legion of white developers.

The poor little kiddy that arrives in Australia
without creeping through a wedding ring still
calls for a lot of sympathy—and a lot of burying.
For a few years he didn’t die in N. S. Wales with
such appalling frequency as he used to; and
curiously enough in those good years the State’s
Statistical Register didn’t give him a table of
figures all to himself. But things have become
bad for him again; and last year for every 1000
“illegitimate” births there were something over
193 deaths. How horrible that record of murder
is can best be judged by the fact that per 1000 of
the other sort of births there were only 67
deaths. Or put it this way. If the little
Australians who didn’t arrive in the orthodox
way only departed at the same rate as
the orthodox little Australians did, there
would have been 196 deaths among them in N. S.
Wales last year ; but as a matter of shameful fact
there were 568 deaths. There is hardly a doubt
that the unfortunates were just as sound, healthy
and vigorous a lot as the others ; and with any-
thing like fair treatment they would have grown
into just as good Australians. But they got such
large quantities of unfair treatment that 372 of
them died over and above those who would prob-
ably have died anyhow. This means that practi-
cally two out of every three who died wouldn’t
have died had their mothers been married women ;
and it wasn’t the infants’ fault that their mothers
weren’t married. From the Australian point of
view the situation is that N. S. Wales had 372
little immigrants on the spot, and it lost them
because apparently it didn’t want them—it
allowed them to be killed, and it had to go to the
expense of burying them ; and all the time it was
yelling .at the top of its voice that it wanted
immigrants, and was prepared to spend large sums
of money in order to get them.
“ Farmer Will ” writes from Tasmania :
I note your correspondent “ M.” combats the argument
that breaking up large estates will lessen sheep and wool
production. Were the friends of the land monopolist in
possession of the sturdy brain of the average navvy or
miner, there would be no need to tell them that it is the
land monopolist who is accountable for the slow increase
of sheep and other live stock—and also for the few bad
reports we hear of inferior meat and wool being exported.
Take our Naturally Blessed but Legislatively Cursed
little island as a shocking example. We have splendid
grazing land, and have yet to learn what a drought
means; yet we are every year importing thousands of
pounds’ worth of meat and butter. Our largest land-
owners are the glorious Trinity of Camerons —Senator
Cameron, Norman Cameron, ex-M.H.lt., and Eustace
Cameron. Among them they own something like a
quarter of a million pounds’ worth of property, compris-
ing what was formerly some 40 to 50 farms or estates. Not
one of them ever wins a prize for a stud sheep, and
they grow very little meat. The same can be said of
G. C. Nicholas, who comes close after the Camerons
as a land monopolist. Now for the other side. Bellevue
—which produced the world’s record in value (1600
guineas) for a stud sheep—is a small place. Esk Vale,
which, perhaps, has another world’s record for average
value per head, for stud sheep, is also small— i.e., under
2000 acres. The same description applies to the
Strathroy Estate of C. B. Grubb, who bought the world’s
record stud ram. E. W. Gibson, of Native Point, is also a
comparatively small land-owner, yet this estate has a
half-century’s record of high-priced sheep behind it.
Speaking by and large, not one of our big land monopo-
lists, outside the V.D.L. Co., has ever been known to have
a live animal fit to be placed in a show yard, neither do
they top the market in wool or fat stock sales.
If a little personal testimony is of any use l ean give
such. Twenty years ago I rented a property (vent £385
per annum). On this I grew some 4100 bushels of grain
and 100 tons of hay each year, and kept sheep. The
early fat lambs sent to market made a sheep-owning land
monopolist break a certain useful commandment. He bid
£370 rent for my place, and got it over my head. He
never put a plough in the ground, grew no grain at all, and
kept no hands on this land save a small boy to trap
rabbits. At the end of three years he kept less store
sheep than I raised ; he had no fat sheep or lambs at all ;
and finally he fixed up for a substantial reduction in rent.
He did one thing more: he turned a simple rustic with
poor but honest parents into a wicked land reformer, who
has been out for the scalps of monopolists for 20 long
years ; yet so far has failed to secure even a hair. They
"are very hard to kill in Tassy; yea, like the rabbits, they
increase and multiply, thriving well on the grass of the
small farmer.
There are two points which stand out con-
spicuously about “ gold ” jewellery : If the article
isn’t hall-marked it is certainly a fraud ; and if it
is hall-marked it is probably a fraud. But, while
very few people expect a trader to be honest, they
recognise that there ought to be limitations, and
when a “nine-carat gold ring” is gold-washed
copper, as happened in a recent Sydney case, it
seems carrying things to excess. It is this sort of
conduct which rouses the sleeping dog. When a
man is making a good thing by selling his 11b.
loaf loz. short weight, lie should be content with
that ; if he is a hog and tries to wolf everything
in sight by making his lib. loaf 16oz. short, he
starts trouble not only for himself, but for a lot of
other people.

At Sydney Royal, “ The Bondman ” con-
tinues to draw big houses. The circumstance is
attributable, in all likelihood, partly to the
sound acting of Bondman Styan, partly to
the doddering behavior of Bland Holt.
He dodders as one to the maunder born.
A notable and rare performance. Really artistic
doddery is a rarity, and rarer still is the actor-
manager who, like Bland, sacrifices the fat of
comparative youth for the dull drab tottersome-
ness of extreme eld.
At this same Royal there will be staged, on
the afternoon of Wednesday, 25th inst., a one-
act play, hight “A Martyr to Principle,” by
Miss Sumner Locke and Stanley McKay—a
collaboration which is new to Sydney. The McKay
portion of the combination is responsible for the
theme, and the Locke portion for the lines. The
venture is in aid of St. Martha’s Industrial Home,
and it will be followed by that good and peren-
nially amusing farce, “Niobe.” ■

surface good nature and geniality, is no exception

According to its own advertisement,
Sydney Tivoli is “the recognised home of the
stars.” Probably the success of Cinquevalli and
Chung L. Soo has driven it to use this intempe-
rate language about itself ; the changing of the
“first part” may also have had something to do
with it. The “first part” is now a fishing village,
and the kilts and violently Scotch music of the
recent Highland fantasy have reeled elsewhere.
(The period of ordinary evening dress which
supervened on the kilted uproar is hereby
disregarded.) The writer noticed, one Satur-
day evening during the bagpipe and haggis
first-parting, that the audience was about
80 per cent. Jew. The thought occurred
to him that the energy expended in playing Scotch
music to people called Cohen and Galilee was a
dead loss. All this by the way. At present the
Kremka Brothers, acrobats, Sprightly Sisters,
and R. H. Douglass are the only human stars at
home, the other first-class turn being supplied by
Rosina Casselli’s trained-dog troupe, which has
returned for a brief farewell season. The Kremkas
are an agile pair who make light of the law of
gravity ; but this particular law has had so many
talented heels flourished in its face that it has
ceased to be regarded seriously—by the audience,
anyhow. The balance of the show is sky.

The Ada Ward holy opera season threatens
to peter out in a rather unseemly fashion.
Ada, like Gaul, was divided into three parts : (1)
She denounced the wickedness of the stage, asked
wildly if an actress could be a Christian, replied
in effect that she couldn’t, and told harrowing
tales of the haggard horrors of the profession ; (2)
she threatened to return to the stage, not to act
but to convert her sinful sisters who still wore the
grease paint of degradation ; (3) she began to com-
plain bitterly that the evangelical game didn’t
pay for axle-grease ; and, by way of a hint that
she might go back after all to the old business, she
declared that she had been earning £lOO a week
up to the day when she skied her last “part”
and became regenerated, and that she had
never experienced a failure in all her long
stage career. People like the writer, who remem-
bered a certain dismal frost at the old Sydney
Opera Hquse, remarked thoughtfully that this
yarn was fairly tough ; but then most evan-
gelists are fairly tough. Having thus paved
the way, Ada Ward seems to have offered to
return to the shameful old profession, and to play
for Walter Bentley at £lOO weekly, and Bentley
appears to have fallen back in a partially insensible
condition at the exorbitance and cheek of the
proposition. Then other troubles arose. A parson
was reported to have said that, owing to Ada’s
ministrations, several actors had been moved to
throw up the eminently regrettable occupation to
which Bentley belongs. Bentley, who seems to be
tired of having clods thrown at his job, clamored at
the lady for the names of the converted actors, and
didn’t get them. Then Walter 8., who must have
become really excited by this time, clamored at
the parson for the names, and met the usual luck
of the individual who tries to pin the elusive
preacher down to details. He received a polite
letter setting forth that it was the Chap-
Alexander mission, not the Ada Ward
mission, which had, to the parson’s own
knowledge, led certain actors to abandon the
old business, but still the names didn’t transpire.
Walter, really aroused by this time, prodded the
reverend person again, and explained that he
didn’t care whose mission it was; he wanted
the names of the converted mummers. Up
to date he doesn’t appear to have got them, and
though the game is amusing it is hardly worth the
candle. The average man of the world never
takes a parson too seriously. He regards the really
enthusiastic holy man as a reckless manufacturer of
evidence—as a person whose kink makes it impos-
sible for him to understand that he shouldn’t
manufacture evidence ; as an active but not adroit
side-stepper in an argument: and as a person who
can no more be pinned down to facts and dates
and details than an infant. Toaska really excited
parson for evidence is cruelty—the same as if one
demanded that a fairy story should be supported
by affidavits.

A meeting is called for to-day at the Green
Room Club (Melbourne) to devise ways and
means for a benefit to Albert Norman, who, after
a long career of hardened villainy, has fallen upon
evil days. Norman, as a (stage) villain is well-
remembered and much-like'd by the old and
middle-aged and recent generations of play-
goers. During many years spent in Bland
Holt’s service he committed forgery, embezzle-
ment, burglary, perjury, usury, assault with
violence, plain theft, blackmail, receipt of
stolen goods, parricide, fratricide, unclecide,
conspiracy, illegitimacy, lunacy, degeneracy,
piracy, insolvency, prison-breaking, abduction,
incivility’ and body-snatching. He was a very
fine actor in villainous parts, and also in good
parts when he got the chance, which should have
happened oftener. Some little time ago he em-
barked on a disastrous hotel speculation and
lost whatever little savings the support of
a wife and family had permitted him to
accumulate. Then his health failed so badly that
he will never embezzle the stage-will again. So
it is up to his many admirers to do something for
Norman. His benefit will happen at the King’s
Theatre, Melbourne, on a date to be fixed.
Meanwhile, people who desire to suitably express
their feelings can communicate with Phil Goatcher
at the Theatre Royal, Melbourne, or Joseph
Daniels, 40 Hunter-street, Sydney.

“The Girls of Gottenberg ” has run for
the usual week at Adelaide Royal, and business
has been big. It is a tuneful trifle, with much
more of a connected story than is usual in these
matters; and the ballet is pronounced by an
excellent judge to be about the best-looking, all
round, within his wide experience. The influence
of the late George Lauri on both Gouriet and
W. S. Percy is very noticeable. “The Merry
Widow ” is running now with many of last year’s
cast; but Florence Young is a curiously different
sort of relict from Carrie Moore. On the whole,
the verdict is summed up in a French proverb :
“Tire absent are always in the wrong.” The
Tivoli has been doing business to delight
the heart of far-away ’Enry Rickards. The
Sprightly Sisters are strikingly English, and
as for Tom Dawson, when he sings of
a magistrate who took to him “at Once,”
the ear straightway yearns for the Cockney rhyme
of “18 monce ” —and gets it. The sisters have
moved on, however, and so have the little Casselli
dogs (who surely must have a strain of the ape in
them). Miss Cissie Curlette has done her best to
make up for these defections, and now Cinquevalli
has come in, and other things don’t much matter.
Cinque has a new assistant comedian, but other-
wise his business moves on much the same lines of
monotonous perfection as of old.

John Foster Fraser, the man who pedalled
round this planet some years ago, and claims to
be familiar with 46 countries, will begin his Aus-
tralian lecture tour at Adelaide Royal on Saturday
(21st), the day of his arrival (D.V. j from the Great
Smoke. The tour is to be a rapid one. Foster
Frazer is a rapid man, anyhow, and he is pressed
for time in this enterprise. He will talk to the
big cities only—Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney
■—with the four centres of Maoriland to follow.
Then he leaps back to London, only hitting the
ground three times in his haste. He is due there
in the middle of September.

A quaint novelty in serio-comic domestic
drama is “The Fencing Master,” produced by
Hugh Ward at Melb. Princess’s last Saturday.
In America it is called a “ play,” seemingly. In
Australia it strikes one as being something unique
in farcical sentimental comedy, humanly interest-
ing as contrasted with “The Fatal Wedding,’
and genuinely humorous in comparison with Van
Biene’s ’cellodrama of “The Broken Melody,’
which was luridly melodramatic in all its color-
ing. The gentle name-character and some of his
amiable associates are creatures of sentimental
comedy; his two ill-wishers were born under a
purple star ; the other people are amusing char-
• acter tvpes driven to extravagance by the exigen-
cies of a Family Herald story. And they all are
gathered together in each act—first at a cheap
Italian Restaurant near Sixth Avenue, New
York ; secondly, at an Art Gallery on Fifth
Avenue ; and, finally, in the top-floor room of the
Fencing Master, whose personal belongings hav.e
mostly "travelled to the pawnshop. Never before
was so unreasonable a play presented by such a

Hugh Ward is a white-haired Italian
marquis in disguise, who teaches New York’s
gilded youth how to fence, and abides at the
restaurant of Luigi, a gouty macaroni of benevo-
lent tendencies. Ward was deprived of his title
and estates by the Italian Government long ago
for having tried to kill the betrayer (Wykeham)
of his young wife. Nowadays he impoverishes
himself to supply the wants of his son (Wernham
Ryott), an inspired art student beloved of Grace
Palotta, the daughter of Mrs. Brough. These
ladies move in millionaire society, but Miss
Palotta is an amateur art student with a beautiful
weakness for “slumming.” She and her mamma
slum into Luigi’s restaurant escorted by Wyke-
ham, the diplomat who accomplished the ruin of
Ward’s first and only love, now deceased. At
the restaurant they strike an unparalleled
birthday party, given by the impecunious fencing
master (Ward, to wit) to celebrate the homing
of age of his gifted offspring. Apart from in-
cidental girls and married couples, who have
blown in casually, the gathering includes Miss
Ghiloni, with her daughter, Rose Musgrove, and
Arthur Eldred, a temporary outcast from the
paternal home. Eldred has got a billet as waiter
at the restaurant, and is supremely unsuited to
the job. To these three prominent outsiders the
“ play” is deeply indebted. Miss Ghiloni, bounte-
ously handsome, is the rich -proprietress of a
lightning hair-restorer, and harbors matrimonial
designs upon Hugh Ward. She suspects him of
noble rank, and proposes, in vain, to restore his
ancient splendor with her dollars. She isn’t
quite convincing, but she’s highly ornamental
and amusing. Miss Musgrove?, her daughter,
is a capital joke. Also she has an absurd
connection with the plot, for she loves Eldred,
the gentleman waiter, in opposition to ma’s
wishes, and the waiter is a fashionable acquaint-
ance of the artist-hero and the tony people. He
acts as treasurer of a secret fund provided by
Grace Palotta for her sweetheart’s art education
in Paris. After 18 months in Paris the genius
returns to New York and exhibits his great
picture at the Gallery aforesaid to all the people
who were at the restaurant in the previous act.
A curtain conceals the picture for a while. At
last the artist informs the company in a lame
speech that he has put his best work into the
mysterious piece of art, after which he draws the
curtain and discloses a life-size portrait of Miss
Palotta. In fact, it is Miss Palotta, as everybody
can see except the people on the stage, who take
it seriously. Just here the plot begins to thicken.
Poor old Hugh Ward reveals himself to the
libertine diplomat, and denounces that morose
citizen to the whole picture gallery. Meanwhile
the diplomat and his caddish son have faked a
charge of forgery against Ward’s son, and gloom
falls on the proceedings. Which gloom is dispelled
in the next act when all the characters in turn
have filed upstairs to the old man’s garret. The
little bits of characterisation, pieced together, go
a long way towards covering a multitude of sins
in the plot of “The Fencing Master.” Hugh
Ward’s is an artistic performance. He doesn’t
achieve all that he attempts in the tender and
tragic passages, but his work is always in-
teresting and even strong at the end of the
second act, where the harsh angularity of Reg
Wykeham’s method is injurious to the false situa-
tion. Ryott, a newcomer, is good-looking and
satisfactory as the young painter, despite his stiff-
ness. Wiiliawi Beattie, as the bad man’s roguish
son, has moments of dramatic force. Robert
Greig, as old Luigi, shows an ability which wasn’t
suggested by his amateur efforts of two or three
years ago. Eldred, as the johnnie, plays his part
to the life, and Charles Knight and H. H. Wallace
are useful in character parts. The acting all round
has redeeming features. Miss Palotta’s manner is
charmingly natural, and in the first act she looks
the girl she is Supposed to be. Mrs. Brough is
valuable in her colorless part. Miss Ghiloni, al-
though her personality is too winsome for her
character, is one of the main supports of the enter-
tainment ; and Rose Musgrove, as her daughter,
is joyously and originally droll.

Changes are impending in two Melbourne
houses. At Her Majesty’s the nights of
“Havana” are numbered, and “The Flag
Lieutenant,” burnt out from its Sydney domicile,
will be played for a fortnight, after which the
nautical drama will be transferred to the Prin-
cess’s, leaving Her Majesty’s to the Comic Opera
co. with “The Duchess of Dantzic.” Mean-
while these last nights of “Havana” have been
depressed by the absence of Bert Gilbert from
the cast. He was down with pneumonia at
time of writing, and the performance seemed
to be suffering from want of backbone.
Lissant acted capably as substitute for the invalid,
and some of the others, in particular Herbert
Clayton, were doing their best to add new fuel to
the fire. But Gilbert had been chief stoker, and
when he was put to bed under medical instruc-
tions, the musical comedy grew rather pale and
listless, even though it didn’t throw up its legs
and expire. There were many elements of life in
“Havana” beside Bert Gilbert, of course. Still
he was the missing quantity that could least be
spared. The arrival of “The Flag Lieutenant”
on Saturday will shake things up again at the
Williamson house.

At Melbourne King’s there will be a
revival of Anderson’s notorious nightmare drama
on Saturday. After the lucid interval of “ It’s
Never Too Late to Mend ” comes “ The Face at
the Window,” or the Wicked Wail of Warning
and the Corpse that Sat up Straight. If Mel-
bourne has any shudders to shud it can prepare to
shud ’em for 14 days, dating from the 14th.
Assuming that Diver will impersonate the wailer
who wears the Face, and Redgrave will get inside
the character of the Corpse, the present writer
has volunteered to play the Window, that nothing
may be wanting to curdle the public’s blood.

“A Romance in Ireland,” described as a
“masterpiece,” is Allen Doone’s latest effusion at
Melbourne Bijou. It has the exceptional recom-
mendation of having been puc together by the
finished young actor himself. As a play, it is a
hash of mild melodrama and sentimental blither.
True, there is a villain, but his stupidity is
exaggerated into pure banality by the effortless-
ness of an untutored mummer. All that
this young man does is to look unpreten-
tiously silly, and to practise the trite sins
of mildly disorderly scoundrels. One of his grossest
crimes is his flabby protestation of love ; while
another is a wildly successful attempt to fasten a
theft on the young lady’s lover. Thereupon, of
course, the lover, Allen Doone, suffers some
social ostracism and the gusty curses of his
cavernous parent, and flies into somewhat public
seclusion, where he conducts a vaudeville busi-
ness. There some cheerless children cavort in
the usual jigs, infamous noises issue from
infamous instruments, and A. Doone does
certain things which might be done better or
better left undone. This young Yankee person-
age, as “ a gay gossoon,” has not the obtrusive
methods of Andrew Mack, but he can warble a
song of tawdry sentiment and do it well. He is
disposed to italicise inanities and give to mere
gallantry the protuberant aspects of a circus or a
farce. Some of his scenes with the heroine are
painfully juvenile. Miss Edna Keeley assists
him in much of this by-play. The support is
various diminutives of good and bad. Miss Ethel
Grist and Frank Cullenane do fair work, but the
bulk of the others seemed determined to embitter
a long-suffering commentator.

At Melbourne Royal the eetimable per-
formance of “The Shrew” is to keep the sacred
lamp of Shakspeare burning for one more week.
Then Oscar Asche will blacken all visible parts of
him, and smother Miss Brayton with a bol-
ster, supported by the rest of the company in
“ Othello.”

Melbourne Town Hall is hanging out an
announcement of the return of Miss Amy Castles
after an absence of over seven years. It sounds a
long time, and this is her second return to Aus-
tralia ; nevertheless, the Voice which Miss Amy
brings with her is still on the sunny side of 30.
She brings also a basso, a tenor and a reputation,
and the box-plan will be opened on Monday.

At Melbourne Town Hall last Satur-
day night the Taits gave an American version of
“Resurrection,” Tolstoi’s familiar yarn of the
naughty Prince and a simple maid. The picture
lacks force and effectiveness through the palpable
artificiality of some of its backgrounds, and might
be a revised version from the hand of Marie
Corelli. Katusha, in her fall, looks deplorable but
human ; but in her upliftment she looks worse.
“For Her Country’s Sake,” another picture, is a
much more pleasant circumstance. It tells of the
remarkable but exhilarating adventures of a
female in the American Civil War, and affirms
that women are capable of surprising actions —
which, however, nobody doubts.

At Melbourne Olympia this week West is
unreeling sundry stories of primitive emotions,
like love, hate, or an aching corn ; and further adds
one or two scenes of various fragments of the
habitable globe. The king picture is “The
Gambler,” a fabrication from the prolific firm of
Pathe Freres. The film is a superior effort,
and reminds one 1 of the French command of
pantomime. Nowadays they can make a shrug
express an innuendo, and reveal a smoke-room
story in a winking eye. Other pictures include
“A Sculptor’s Love” and “ The Two Pigeons,”
“Morning in the Bois de Boulogne,” which is
self-explanatory ; and some snapshots of the eldest
hopeful of Kaiser Bill. Wilhelm, junior, in his
uniform is long and gawky.

Chung Ling Soo, that bonnie braw China-
man of the Clan MacTavish, is back at Melbourne
Opera House with many new tricks and illusions.
New or old, the things that Soo does so uncon-
cernedly are more or less amazing. He produces
half an acre of bunting from apparent emptiness,
and breeds poultry out of space. Of all magicians
who have happened this way he is the only one
qualified to shake hands with himself. And he
does it. Florence and Lilian are blowing their
post horns as before, also one of them —Flo or
Lil —plays the violin, whilst Lil or Flo assists at
the piano. The Two Bells dance sweetly in tune,
and the Meisters continue their contribution to a
bill which is now unduly long. It is always the
same contribution. The frequent patrons of
Rickards’would not miss the Meisters if they were
to fold up their kilts like the Arabs, and as silently
steal away.
The “ Oldest Inhabitant ” turns over some
musty documents :
In the N.S.W. Land Titles Office the searchers some-
times have interesting title deeds for examination. Re-
centlyoneof the earliest cropped up. Asolicitor, examining
an old title, came across a bit of history connected with
Watson’s Bay, though that name does not appear in the
parchment. On February 12, 1793, Lieutenant-Governor
Grose, of the 102nd Regiment, granted to Edward Laing,
who was his surgeon’s mate, 20 acres of land on the south
side of the harbor at Camp Cove, to be known by the
name of Roddam Farm. Six months later Laing sold to
Thomas Laycock (Laing returned to England with Grose
jn the Daedalus, in December, 1794), the Oft. Gin. quarter-
master of the corps, who, George Howe says, nearly dis-
located his joints in the old printing office loft while
searching for Governor Bligh, the Gazette office being
then a shed or lean-to attached to Government House.
On July 10, 1795, Edgar Thomas Dell—apparently a
trader of some sort, as he sold the Government 64,9001 b.
of rice—became the purchaser for £5O. Two months
later Dell sold to Captain Bampton, of the Calcutta ship
Shah Hormuzear, for £7l. By will, dated July 10, 1813,
the Captain left the property to his son, Captain William
Bampton. his daughter Sarah (wife of James Donnithorne,
of the Indian Civil Service), and R. C. Bampton, in equal
shares. Major—ex-Captain—Bampton bequeathed his half-
share to his nephew, Edward H. Donnithorne, and his niece,
Eliza E. Donnithorne. In 1854, by the death of the other
beneficiaries the two last-named found themselves the
owners of the whole estate, Eliza owning five-sixths and
Edward one-sixth. In 1854 they sold out to R. M. Robey
(George Dibbs’ father-in-law), an ironmonger in George-
street, Sydney; and Elias Carpenter Weekes, also a
George-street ironmonger, and three times State
Treasurer. They cut up the land, and on October 10,
1859, sold part to Geo.'ge Wigram Allen for £3OOO.
The last personality to appear in the title is Premier
•John Robertson, who purchased from Allen in 1880 for
£707 10s., thirteen lots in -the neighborhood of Pacific
and Victoria streets. In connection w-ith the Donni-
thornes there is a romantic story. The last of the name,
living on the Newtown-road, was engaged to be married.
On the day of the wedding she arrayed herself in her bridal
finery, but the bridegroom came not, and he was never
again heard of. The lady became a sort of melancholy
mad hermit. She was said to be the original of Miss
Havisham in Dickens’ “Great Expectations.”
AT POVERTY POINT.
“0.K.” : There is one line in “The Taming of the
Shrew ” which goes straight to the understanding of
every woman in the audience at Melbourne Koyal every
time Petruchio utters it. It happens in the scene where
the haberdasher brings the cap and gown ordered for
Katharine, and her husband pretends to reject them as
things beneath contempt. Petruchio hurls abuse at the
lisping haberdasher, “ Away, thou rag, thou quantity,
thou remnant!” Oscar Asche’s intonation is exactly
suited to the words. They speak of drapers’ clearing
sales and “ bargain ” counters. A titter of feminine appre-
ciation is heard from all round the house. The haber-
dasher becomes at once a little piece of goods offered at
an alarming sacrifice. A rag, a quantity, a remnant—re-
duced to fijd. a yard. The words are not foisted on the
text like Katharine’s angry cry of “ I want my supper ! ”
They are Shakspeare’s. One feels that there mu-.t have
been bargain sales even in the Bard’s time. An appren-
tice must have stood at the mercer’s door snouting
“Remnants!”
The Bulletin has a nice girl correspondent in Mel-
bourne who is mad on punctuation. In the hope of
persuading her to diminish her commas, it reproduces
one of her items in its raw state : “ The young daughter,
of a Collins Street Medicine man, got a good deal of the
limelight, provided for the Oscar Asche, Lily Brayton,
Company. On the opening night, the young woman,
(who occupied a seat in the front row of the ‘Gods’)
hung over the railing, to such an extent, that the actors
on the stage, thought every minute, she would land in
the footlights. She wildly hurled, a wilted bunch of
violets, at the leading lady’s head, and followed them,
with the roses out of her hat, so wild was her behavior,
that half the vast audience, were asking ‘ Who is it ? ’
Perhaps the muffins, provided by, the thoughtful Oscar,
had gone to the young person’s, head ? ”
“ J.P.” : Those dramatists who are rushing wildly in the
wake of “ An Englishman’s Home ” do not seem to realise
the real cause of the sensation created in Fog Land by
this play. It was the talk of Bulldoin, not because it was
a defence play, and not because defence chanced to be in
the air when it was produced ; but by reason of the fact
that it brought right home to the individual members of
the audience the position in which they themselves might
stand should an invader land on the shores of the Cold
Country. Everyone who witnessed the play saw before
him, as in a vision, his own home, with himself occupj’ing-
the place of Brown. It was the personal element that
accounted for the play’s appeal, though the appeal was
partly spoiled by the ridiculous ending. It was a drama
that dealt with individuals, and in that lay its power.
Randolph Bedford, in his work, has missed this point
entirely. He tries to cover the earth, or a big portion of
it, but he doesn’t show the invader in our own drawing
room, occupying our beds, digging entrenchments in our
garden, and carelessly letting his shells fall in our kitchen.
So the people don’t quite realise.
“S.”: Two things tend to weaken the comical im-
pression of Rose Musgrove’s humorous waiting maid in
“ A Bachelor’s Honeymoon”—the author’s inability, and
the suggestion of deformity. Deformity is not funny,
and the warp in Marianne detracts to some extent from
the fun of Rose Musgrove’s broad caricature. If Miss
Rose had observed the kitchen drudge type more closely,
she would have seen that the characteristic attitude of
Mary Ann is one with a bend in the chest and the hips
curiously thrown forward, an attitude born of standing
at sinks, washing interminable dishes. I have seen it in
scores of servants, but never yet on the stage.
“J.P.” : Budding playwrights, arise ! Sing hail ! Like-
wise glory ! Plays are wanted. Bring forth the three-
act comedy, the seventebn-scene bellow-drama and the
frisky, frothy comic opera libretto ! Let them multiply
in the land, for they are wanted, and wanted badly,
wherever the mummer mummeth and the corpulent
manager manageth. Rush forth, for at your doors there
knocketh a strutter in the limelight, one Oscar Asche,
whose heart pineth for a new play. Oscar fled from
Fogtown with his beauteous wife because he had played
his repertoire to death, and could not unearth a new
play of any value. He has come to Australia with those
tons of scenery, because, here, he will seem new in the old
plays ; but, nevertheless, he has his eye lifting for a new
article—one that will require a gorgeous setting and
effective costumes preferred. Lily Brayton won’t play
without her husband, and she longs to be seen in costume ;
hence Oscar’s anxiety for a new play. If Oscar is ever to
go back to Fogtown he must get that new play, and an
Australian might as well have the honor and the cash
attaching thereto. Therefore let the midnight oil be
burnt that act may be added to act. Arise and bring
forth the drama ! Even if Oscar gazeth upon it with the
cold eye of disdain, there is still N. York and Fogtown
waiting for the masterpiece.
“ Melb ”: A great variety theatre is being erected in
Wirth’s Pleasure Park, late Princes’ Court, Melbourne.
A boulder-throw away is the Olympia, where Wirth
Brothers will also exploit living pictures, or whatever else
catches on. Then West’s new Picture Theatre, just
across the road, is being roofed in as I write. It is a plain
enormous brick barn, but it will be luxurious inside.
Over the road again there is the huge Glaciariuni, where
Tait’s Pictures will be going next month (September),
opening about the same time as West’s new theatre. Add
the Continental Picture Garden, accommodating 4000, in
the immediate vicinity, and there will be five big flicker-
graphic shows. Sunday business is to be a great feature
with four of them. The Cyclorama, in East Melbourne,
now takes about £5O on a Sunday night with its pictures,
and has a profitable Sunday afternoon show as well.
“ Silas Snell ” : When the Fitzgeraldßros.’circus struck
Quandong (Vie.) on its way across to Beechworth in 1900
or thereabouts, it camped on Quaker’s Flat. There was
a bit, of an alluvial rush on at Quaker’s just then, and a
fairly flourishing camp had sprung up, mushroom-like, on
the hillside facing the township. William Waffles was
one of the most successful of the diggers, but Waffles
when in funds, took to drink with both hands. His two
brothers-in-law were away conducting sluicing operations
for Henry Solomonson when he broke the local Walker’s
record, and there was no one to chain him up. On the
second night of William Waffles’ proceedings a furious to-
do broke out in the Fitzgerald menagerie, and all the
fauna lifted up their voices and made the remarks pecu-
liar to their kind—made all the remarks that werein them.
Even the elephant emptied himself of every observation
he contained, and there wasn’t so much as a comma in his
huge interior when he had finished. The watchers
rushed the tent, and Dan Fitzgerald arrived, breathless,
in his pyjamas, clutching a banana in his right hand,
with the delusion that he had grabbed a revolver. The
full strength of the company discovered Mr. Waffles in no
clothes worth mentioning apart from a woman’s sun-
bonnet, joyously stirring up the animals with a long
pole. He uttered shouts of jubilation and capered like a
frantic ape when the prodded specimen threw a back
hand-spring, or put up a really convincing roar. The
hands took bold of the intruder, and held him hard, while
Dan Fitzgerald stood a yard off and told him things with
a flow of vituperation that has been equalled by few and
excelled by none. The defendant waited. He did not
seem much impressed. And when Dan paused for breath,
the rabid miner said: “See here, mate, whose blessed
jim-jams are these, anyway—yours or mine?”
“S.S.”: I really wish somebody in authority would
speak to Grace Palotta about her intemperate hilarity.
She has quite a nice laugh set to music. It could be
played on the violin. But that melodious cachinnation
is distressingly overworked at times. In “ A Bachelor’s
Honeymoon ” Miss Palotta, as the wife who was compelled
to lie low in her own home, commenced laughing when
the curtain rose, and she laughed precisely the same laugh
twice a minute till the curtain fell on the finish.
There was a funeral in the Oscar-Asehe company last
■dveek. Edgar Ruthven, a clever young fellow—he was only
24—who acted as stage manager under Asche’s direction,
had to go into a private hospital to be operated upon.
One operation led to another, seemingly, and then the
patient died of peritonitis, and was buried at Melbourne
General Cemetery. The late Mr. Ruthven, who graduated
under Beerbohm Tree’s direction, had been some time
with Oscar Asche’s co., and his death is a real loss.
“ Ophelia ” sits up on her bier and complains : “„I was
present at the last night of the Walter Bentlev season,
and was glad to have it on such good authority that a
revival of Shakspeare is imminent. Certainly all the
signs suggest that public taste is improving. When
Margaret Anglin was here (in Sydney, at anv rate) the
house was often more than half full, 'and at'her Shaks-
pearian pieces it was often quite crowded moderately in
spots up to a certain point. Such confidence bad the
Bentley management in the improved taste of the public
that it was originally intended to stage “Hamlet ” for four
nights. In the case of the Nellie Stewart company, the
J. O. Williamson management had quite unbounded faith
in the reformed taste of Sydney playgoers, and after
some months or years of “Kittv Be'llairs,” “As You
Like It,” the most idyllic of Shakspeare’s comedies,
was recklessly thrown on the boards for a week.
Among other iong runs about this time may be mentioned
Shakspeare’s “Jack and Jill,” which ran till it dropped
dead from weariness, both in Sydney and Melbourne, and
was in each case withdrawn at the height of its popular-
ity'; also the Immortal Bard’s “ Cinderella,” withdrawn
from Melbourne while still sprinting for all it was worth,
after 17 weeks. Picture shows, too, increase like rabbits.
Of course, we have had rather a surfeit of Shakspeare
lately. His “ EastLymne’’has become wearisome. Previous
to Margaret Anglin and disregarding Tilly Brown's
“Romeo and Juliet,” we have only' to go back as far as
Musgrove’s season, which happened, I think, about the
time the banks broke and absorbed the money I had been
saving up for a long holiday at Gosford.
“S.S.”: As a result of Vic.’s universal Saturday half-
holiday, Melbourne theatres can’t hold the people who
want to crowd into then' on Saturday nights, and any
old thing fills up, provided Swanston and Flinders streets
are not too deep in mud to be waded. The local Reper-
tory party that wants to reform Australian dramatic
taste should buy, beg, or build a convenient establish-
ment, run a biograph entertainment or a revivalist
■mission, or a fight five nights a week, and a Shaw, Ibsen,
Galsworthy or Suderntann drama on the sixth. It could
do this with the aid of a company of the smartest semi-
amateurs it could find, aided by such efficient pros as
might be available for the moment. It would probably
lose its money as gradually that way as any other.
AGAINST NATURE.

It is alleged that owing to Miss Ada Ward’s ministrations
many actors have been induced to abandon acting- in
favor of a more godly form of livelihood.— News Item.
Ada, I wish I could believe
You are not incorrect
When you allege that mummers leave
The stage and turn “ elect ”
At your behest, and after cleave
For ever to your sect.
There are so many one would fain
See leave off acting, and
Exploit their stock of brawn and brain
In shops or on the land —
A move whereby they’d surely gain
Applause on ev’ry hand.
A certain “juvenile” I know,
Aye, with green limelight laved,
Likewise an “ Angel Child ” or so
Concerning whom folks raved
Full fifteen weary years ago—
Would —would that these were “ saved ” !
A “ heavy ” whom I always meet
Upon my walks abroad,
Who hails me from across the street
And cuts into my hoard
Of beer-cash ere I can retreat—
I wish he’d find the Lord.
Some players of the comic breed
(Amongst whom are a lot
Of politicians, G. H. Reid,
J. Cook et al), I wot ,
They’d fill a crying public need
By getting Virtue hot.
So that they fled to private life,
And fought with pious glee
The good old battle to the knife
’Gainst Satan. Yet (ah me !)
I know full well that holy strife
Will never, never be.
For Ada, I regret to say,
In one respect the mime
’S like Masons, priests and such who stay
Priests, Masons for all time,
Regardless of the fact that they
Be steeped in earthly grime.
“ An actor once, an actor aye ”
The luck may look coal black ;
The public may avert its eye,
And turn its scornful back ;
Nothing will make your true mime fly
The Stage, except the sack.

ISAAC’S RIVAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
VICTORIA.
Come hearken to the tale of woe
Of Isaac Israel Offenblow.
He loved a girl—her name was Flo —
Who showed of nights
In pale blue tights,
And danced in gold and purple lights
In Simpson’s Turquoise Ballet, which
Was fatal to the middling rich
Some five and twenty years ago,
But more particularly so
To Izzy Izzy Offenblow.
This dainty, dimpled, dancing Flo
Was, for a time, content to show
Her love for Isaac—who, you know,
Made all he owns
From precious stones,
And still more precious little loans.
But Israel did things by halves—
He cast no pearls before the calves
Of ballet girls, and pretty Flo
Grew tired of Isaac Offenblow.
’Twas long ere Isaac came to know
She had another, nicer beau.
And Philip Smith was glad to throw
Rare rubies red,
A wondrous spread
Of precious stones, at Florry’s head.
Smith in a year was “ stony broke,”
Which callous people thought a joke.
But which was an astounding blow
To Isaac Israel Offenblow
It did not matter much to Flo,
She’d diamonds and good cash to show.
And Johnnies come and Johnnies go ;
But wealth of Smith
Was mostly myth.
He’d simply worked some dodges with
A scheme of credit. All the stones,
The rings, the bangles, and the loans
With which he won our fickle Flo
He’d raised by forged and bogus pro-
Missory notes from Offenblow.

STILL ANOTHER G. WASH.
MOTHER: “Good gracious, William Henry, what
have you been doing?”
W. HENRY: “Mother, I scorn to tell a lie. I’ve
been fighting.”
You never know where you'll find your
missus again if once you lose the run of her. The
other day, at Christchurch (M.L.), Thomas Long
went to the house of one Moody, asking for
food. Alas! he was given a stone. Moody
said he had no tucker to throw away; but
he had a woman there, and if Long would take
her away and marry her he should have £lO. This
absurd proposal so riled Long that he smashed a
window of the Moody Castle. Moody became
annoyed at the double injury—refusal to take the
woman and the destruction of property—and had
Long arrested. In due course the woman ap-
peared in court as witness against Long. “ Why,
your Worship,” said Long, “that woman is my
wife ! ” The woman emphatically denied this ;
but after an adjournment the marriage certificate
was produced, and it was all even as Long had
asserted. The Magistrate said, in effect, that he
didn’t chre whose wife she was, or what Moody
and Long decided to do in that matter, but
he could not allow anybody to go about smashing
windows. Still Long had been in gaol from the
time of the assault on the pane, and all the parties
had their troubles, so no further punishment was
inflicted.
About a wasliing-place :
It seems that Melbourne in general, as well as the
marine suburb of St. Kilda in particular, is concerning
itself about the threatened abolition of Kenney’s Baths. A
first crowded meeting of St. Kilda ratepayers led to a
second gathering, whereat the malodorous bearings of
the matters were more fully discussed and sniffed at.
Premier Murray’s announcement of an “ absolutely final ”
refusal to grant Kenney a suitable new site for men’s sea
baths, north of the spot where the doomed structure has
been established for 55 years, is apparently the result of a
job which he didn’t trouble to discover. Some of
the facts of the case were stated in The Bulletin
two or three weeks ago. There are only two
baths for men on the St. Kilda foreshore, and
the abolition of Kenney’s would leave the rival
show with the monopoly it has been working for. Kenney’s
is a one-man show ; the other is run by a syndicate in
which the great J. H. Riley and his Hebrew partner are
less openly interested than Theodore Pink. Fink, ere
going to England to vent his airy persiflage at the Press
Conference, actually “approached” Kenney, the present
proprietor of the old baths, in order to deter him, if pos-
sible, from proceeding- further with his plans for new
baths. He told him frankly that his scheme would be
blocked, and that he liad better be content to have a
monopoly—unguaranteed, by the way—of the business in
women’s baths whilst the syndicate catered for the
male population. Nevertheless, Kenney remained con-
fident that justice would be done him, seeing that St.
Kilda is Melbourne’s principal washing place in the
summer, and the rush of men for a cold dip on a hot day,
and a hot sea bath on some days in winter or summer, is
in excess of all the available accommodation. Govern-
ment surveyors called upon Kenney and discussed gravely
with him the question of the best possible site for new
baths, north of his old pitch. Yet, when he was called to
“confer” with the Government and the St. Kilda Council,
he found that he hadn’t Buckley’s chance of getting a
northern site. Apparently Premier Murray didn’t know
at the time that his action was scandalous. He can no
longer plead ignorance, and if he goes to sleep on the
knowledge of his error he will be awakened in the Vic-
torian Legislature to answer some nasty questions.
* * * *
The N.S.W. Government has introduced
a fairly promising measure which aims at doing
something more for the Chronic Drunk. At pre-
sent very little is done for the human cornstalk
Tank, and that little is done badly. A wing of
Darlinghurst gaol is set apart as an inebriates’
hospital, or home, or retreat, but a Tanks’
Retreat should not be in a gaol nor should it
be in a city; a place like Lord Howe
Island would be vastly more to the point.
Then the old law is so defective that it is difficult
to catch the Tank and put him or her in the
place set apart for the treatment of the Tank
disease ; and yet the accommodation is so much
more deficient than the law that it is always over-
crowded. As evidence on this point, there lately
transpired in a N.S.W. court a woman of 36 with
over 200 convictions to her discredit, all either for
drunkenness or unlawfully acquiring drink money.
A woman of this sort seems a most fitting subject
for treatment; but despite the frequency with
which the police captured her, they never once
had the luck to run her in at a time when there
was a vacant bed in the woman’s branch of the
State Drunkery. Therefore, she battled into and
out of gaol in the old purposeless fashion, and no
serious attempt has been made to reform her unto
this day.

“ Floater ” reports on an art show :
A wander through the Victorian Artists’ Society show
at Melbourne is like a pilgrimage through an exhibition
of Xmas and New Year cards. Quite a surprising quan-
tity of the pictures wear that appearance of pretty
prettiness associated with those mediums of communica-
tion. There are yards of roses in noisy pinks ; unentic-
ing scraps of landscape ; and a preponderance of female
heads that make the visitor sit down, dead wearied with
so much impetuous commonplaceness. Moreover, there
are two—just two —nudes, that sternly deny the beauty
of the female form divine. One is by McClintock, andis a
fragment of sward and seashore, studded with intolerable
bits of nakedness, two of which stand aggressively in the
foreground with the moral support of a dog. The other,
frivolously entitled “Young Australia,” is by Tom
Carter, it is a band performance, and the din thereof
strikes the spectator as he climbs the stairs.
With those pieces of work, one contrasts the refined
performances of Bernard Hall, who contributes two
or three nicely-painted heads —one represents a pleasing
brunette of a Latin type—besides a couple of still-
life pieces of impressive quality. Charles Wheeler, the
most notable of the younger men, is represented by a
vast portrait, that wants to be toured at excursion rates
to be seen entirely ; and (besides smaller items) by “The
Portfolio,” a charming-! canvas, rather eminent for its
flesh painting and extra handling of a rich, blue-black,
velvet gown. Leslie Wilkie is unpromising. Of his
batch “ The Feather Boa,” a strong head of a full-lipped,
red-headed lady, is the most arresting ; but his portrait
of a damsel on a staircase is dull and lifeless, until the eye
descends to the maiden’s protuberant boots in a strident
tan. Fred McCubbin, who ivill paint portraits occasion-
ally, exhibits several bits of landscape, one, “ Moonrise,”
being a superiorstudy in atmospheric effects.
John Ford Paterson is known by one or two sections of
earth and tree and sky in freezing tones ; Walter
Withers, another first-class landscapist, hangs some
excellent “ scenes,” one of which—a bit of Nicholson-
street, Fitzroy—is about the area of a visiting card ;
while Norman Mac George, of South Australia, Will
Ashton, the youthful Ben Boyd, and the veteran Mather,
who is announced by one or two tea-caddy illustrations—
add their quota of “works”to the show. Sculptor Web.
Gilbert declares his presence with two or three bronze
heads of brother artists ; John Shirlow attaches his signa-
ture to a trio of etchings ; while black-and-white work
by Ida Rentoul and Ruby Lindsay, and some unhappy
posters by one Taylor, are noticed in passing. Taking
the show as a whole, one should say that a goodly amount
of tripe has slipped into it by kind permission of the
selection committee.

“ Phil Mite ” writes :
A N.S.W. farmer—part of the backbone of Riverina—
has got himself into a peculiar matrimonial tangle.
While away from the plough he fell a victim to the
charms of a damsel in an adjoining town, and things
happened. He proposed marriage, but at the last minute
discovered that there were difficulties in the way. How-
ever, he took her out to his farm, and they talked Cow,
and the bairns came—three or four of them. Then the
attraction of the Backbone and his Cow began to fade—
and more things happened, without the Backbone being
in them. And the bairns still came. Finally the woman
attached herself to husband No. 3, and engineered
a maintenance case against trie man with the farm. Then
the sorting out of the youngsters took place before an
amazed P.M. There were half-a-dozen little Backbones,
but Backbone Senior owned up to four, and re-
pudiated any responsibility for the other two. The
bewildered P.M. shrank from the task of determin-
ing the question of paternity, and in the end made an
order, by consent, for 225. 6d. per week. This was some
years ago. and as the days have passed, the uncertain
father has paid up like an honest Backbone—and the
woman has lived with the other fellow. The other day,
one of the children came of age, and the father docked
ss. off the weekly donation. Then the facts had to be
explained all over again to another P.M., who nearly
hurst a blood vessel in his head and then dismissed
everything. The trouble is that a lot more bairns have
come, and have been mixed up with the others, and Back-
bone is threatened with the paternity of the lot of them.
To make matters worse, the woman has claimed that the
stock on the farm belongs to her, and her present “ hus-
band ” recently swooped down and removed a lot of it.
The position with husband No. 2 at present is something
like this : He has no wife, some children (how many the
P.M. could not ascertain), he is making a big weekly pay-
ment, and he is in daily dread of losing as much of his
farm as can be driven away ; also he has a lawyer on the
job, and the part of his farm which cannot be driven
away is consequently in jeopardy.
OFF TO THE WEDDING OF A HARD CASE.
“ Step it out, Jim, or well be out of it; it'll be all over in ten minutes !”
“I’ll bet it'll take more than ten minutes to marry Bill!"
The earlier journalists’ clubs in Sydney
mostly went under in a sea of beer, in which a
mixed lot of silly boys and older fools floundered,
sadly out of their depth. The latest attempt, the
N.S.W. Institute of Journalists, is dodging this
rock-strewn sea, and is run on the reasonable
assumption that newspaper men can meet and
play billiards or cards or chess, or swop lies, with-
out holding themselves up by the bar counter. A
benevolent fund has been started for the benefit
of pressmen who, through no fault of their own,
have fallen upon evil days, and find it hard to
chase the wolf off the verandah. By the end of
the year there should be about £lOOO to the credit
of this fund.
The Chapzander evangelists claim to have
converted 1300 people at Ballarat ; yet it isn’t
one whit safer to buy Ballarat mining stocks than
it was before. As for the 5000 sinners who were
converted in Melbourne, it is just about time the
preachers started a new mission and converted
them a second time. After all, a converted sinner
is very like a converted loan. He falls due again.
BOOTS AND HEAVEN.
SKY PILOT OF THE PERIOD (who has called in to
have his sandal mended, and got on to his
pet subject): “Have you any hopes regard-
the future of the soul, my dear friend?”
HIS DEAR FRIEND: “None whatever! The
durned thing ain’t even jit for brake leather.”
The Church is respectfully asked, in re the
following advt., if it isn’t darned well ashamed oi
itself :
Eff CASTLE CATHEDRAL.
Verger Wanted from September 1.
Duties, entire care and cleaning Cathedral, Hall, etc.
Wages, 30s. weekly, fees and house.
Married man. without children , preferred.
Written applications, with copies of testimonials, to
H. H. CLACK,
Bolton-sti¥et, Newcastle.
The Church preaches a good deal at intervals
about the declining birthrate and the refusal of
women to do their duty as mothers ; about the sins
of abortion, child-desertion and child-murder.
And a fruitful cause of all five is that shameful
advertisement which says “no encumbrances”
or “without children preferred.” It is a very
common sort of advertisement. Even the person
who seeks a humble job at Newcastle Cathedral
has a better chance of getting it if his wife has
adopted some of the means which the Church
denounces to prevent the birth of her child, or if,
failing in that, the infant has been either mur-
dered or deserted with such skill that the deed
escaped detection. Yet child murder or desertion
hardly seems the right kind of qualification for a
verger somehow.
The Law has no perception of the relative
sizes of things. It meanders placidly over a case
of murder, and even three cases of infanticide in
one day don’t move it out of its accustomed crawl;
but when a bigamy that doesn’t amount to a
row of pins happens along, even an army with
banners isn’t as terrible as the Law’s determina-
tion to get to the bottom of things. The other
day it hunted up- John Anderson, and
asked him to explain the existence of two
simultaneous Mrs. Andersons. No. 1 told the
Law that she wedded John in 1897, she
being then 24 and he 20. Two days after
the function he faded away, and stayed
away quite a while. The narrative of
No. 2 was more detailed. She had married John
in 1902, at an agency in West Melbourne. He
was quite drunk at the time, and so was she ; but
she was certain he was her John. They parted at
the agency door ; John seems to have just faded
away again while she lost herself. The “John”
who arrested John said that No. 2 could neither
read nor write, and was distressingly vague about
the details of her marriage, wherefore he had been
unable to find the witnesses or the parson who
performed the alleged ceremony. Moreover, when
he arrested Mr. Anderson he was in the company
of wife No. 1, and the pair were having a gay old
time with another John named Barleycorn. After
which the Law assumed a dignified aspect, said it
was a serious matter, and committed John Ander-
son for trial.

“MEN’S OUTFITTERS,”
GEORGE STREET, SYDNEY.
“ A.M.” writes :
Recent happenings in Spain must have given a violent
shock to the prevalent British notion that the Peninsula
is devotedly Catholic and abjectty priest-ridden. Only
jn a couple of provinces is there now any trace of the old-
time clerical domination. Indeed, the present writer’s
experience is that the majority of educated Spaniards are
freethinkers, and that the “masses,” where they are not
blankly indifferent in the matter of religion, are, as
Republicans, violently anti-Papal. The Orange Lodsres
and such like don’t get the hang of the situation. They
label Spain and Italy and France as Roman Catholic,
because they aren’t Protestant, and they want to
make these places Protestant. It is too late for
that—a great deal too late. England broke away
from the R. C. Church at a time when the
religious sentiment was still strong; therefore it
became Protestant—that is to say, it moves along
through Protestantism to Indifference'. Spain, Italy and
France are simply progressing from Roman Catholicism
to Indifference without taking Protestantism on the road.
Having shot past the Protestant station without stopping,
they don’t feel inclined now to back the train merely
that they may call at a wayside place in which they take
MODERN CHIVALRY.
"Do you really think many men marry for money?”
"No; hut I don’t think many women are left to he old maids
just because they’ve got it.”
no interest, and where they have neither goods nor
passengers to deliver. The convent, and the monastery
and the priest remain just as the church and the vicar
remain in England, because nobody is sufficiently excited
to interfere with them ; but the principal religions of the
two countries is the same—lndifference. Doubt and the
Peeling That It Doesn’t Matter. Barcelona, when I knew
it, had about 30 convents (it hasn’t nearly that
number now), but they were only an old habit—
they really meant nothing, except that they sup-
plied some education and some nursing and charitable
aid. Also it had about 20 theatres. The Catalans are a
strenuous folk who thoroughly live their lives, and
Barcelona has always been a world-flesh-and-de’vilish
kind of city.
The great Chap-Alexander mission is gone
on its way, and there is leisure to size up the re-
sults thereof. It was a powerful mission, an im-
passioned appeal to the community to walk the
chalk-line of righteousness; and the converts
were numbered by thousands. Also these con-
verts went forth to convert others and to spread
sweetness and light around them. And yet the
practical results seem nil. People tramp in the
same unmannerly fashion on the wrong side of
the footpath. They expectorate just the same.
Crime hasn t diminished any more than usual.
The converted shopkeeper gives the same short
weight and doubtful measure, and there is no per-
ceptible change in the adulteration. The con-
verted landlord hasn’t taken 6d. off the rent of
the rack-rented hovel, nor is he any more ap-
proachable about repairs. The people who were
horribly ill-paid before are exactlv where they
were, unless the Wages Board intervened. The
Women’s Tory League person has acquired not one
atom more knowledge of decency or fair play, and
her lie about the Labor party’s designs upon the
marriage tie is in all its youthful bloom. The
selfish desire of everybody to have the Federal
capital at his back door and the trans-Australian
railway passing through his backyard, regardless
of the general interests of the country, shows no
variableness nor shadow of turning. Nobody has
reminded N.S.W. Premier Wade with any new
energy that it would be a square thing to keep his
old election promise and cut down borrowing to
£1,500,000 a year or less, and also to establish a
genuine sinking fund ; so the solid truth appears
no further ahead than it was. Not a single big
landlord seems to have been moved by altruistic
motives to cutup his estate and let his fellow men
have a show at a moderate figure. The Sydney
City Council has to struggle as hard as ever with
the outrageous claim of the slum house-owner whose
property has to be resumed for the good of his
fellow-creatures, and the City Treasurer has still
to defend the cash-box with an axe. In these and
thousands of other ways—in fact, in every practi-
cal way—the results of the Chap-Alexander
mission seem to be nil—as usual. There is a
visible increase in the number of people who are
willing to talk about the Pearly Gate of Heaven,
but the use of surreptitious and corrupt back-door
devices on earth goes on just the same. Thus a
vague suspicion wanders around like an unquiet
ghost to the effect that the Chapzander mission
might just as well have stayed away, or have
dropped its holy disguise and been plain variety
show.

The two experiences of the Newcastle tug
Irresistible, whilst endeavoring to drag the barque
Antiope into port, show what a wild existence is
that of the tugboat crew when the winter gales
are swooping over the ocean. Tho Irresistible
steamed out of the N.S.W. coal port in the dark
hours of a Monday morning to scour the seas fora
job. At 11 o’clock, when about 25 miles from the
edge of Australia, the Antiope was discovered
floundering about. It wanted a tow, and, although
the sea was high and the wind whistling a cheer-
less tune, the skipper of the Irresistible decided
to have ago at it. The towline was made fast,
and the tug, with the barque sagging at its
tail, went ahead and started to scramble over the
rough seascape, like a chained bulldog dragging
its kennel over mountains. They made fair pro-
gress until the wind woke up and saw what was
being done. Then it took its vest off and blew
like all the commercial travellers that ever lived.
Hour after hour it howled and shrieked ; it blew
all the rest of the day; it blew all night; and,
when next morning came, it was still at it.
Although the tug had been hanging on for nearly
24 hours, it and its appendage were 10 miles
further off the coast than when the contract began.
With the light, the Irresistible cast off in disgust
and struggled back to Newcastle just in time
to prevent a search party setting out. After
a day’s rest it steamed out again to look
for work and once more the Antiope was met.
The sea and wind just then were in an orderly
frame of mind ; but no sooner was towing com-
menced than a gale raced down, and the wind-
jammer, which had a lot of canvas set, started to
race level with the tug. The 1800-foot line swung
round in a semicircle and dragged the tug broad-
side on to the gale. Then a big wave fell on
board, and the Irresistible was almost smothered
for ever when the mate sprang at the sea-harness
with the hatchet and cut free. A mad scoot for
home against all the fury of the sea was the final
circus act. At time of writing the Antiope, with
about £lOO worth of rope that doesn’t belong to it,
was still at sea. A. prompt mate with a sharp
hatchet js worth his wages. Until Private Enter-
prise was interfered with, it used to reckon a tug-
boat had no room for a mate.
DAMAGES AND REPAIRS.
FRIEND: “Good heavens, old ohap, are you badly hurt ?”
THE VICTIM : “Can't say till I see my solicitor. ”
“The woman pays”—sometimes. The
two sets of jurymen that weighed the evidence
against Martha Cox and her lover, Albert Hay,
charged with squeezing the life out of Edward
Cox, of Horsham, reached different conclusions,
one finding Hay guilty of manslaughter, the other
acquitting the lady altogether. Many a woman
has had worse luck than Mrs. Cox. While her
elderly and somewhat feeble husband of 51 was
being choked to death by his young antagonist,
she stood in the passage outside the room. Cox
died of strangulation, accelerated by a weak heart,
and strangulation takes some minutes to accom-
plish ; yet, though the police station was only
300yds. away from Cox’s shop, she didn’t call the
police. In fact, she even held the servant back
when that frightened woman wanted to rush for
help. But the two juries reached different con-
clusions, so the widow of 31 goes free,while the
lover of 22 goes to gaol for 15 years.
“ Maiden Aunt ” writes :
With a view to assisting Field-Admiral Onslow to per-
fect his Age-of-Consent-raising Bill in N.S.W. Assembly,
I beg to direct his careful attention to “ Hassan’s ” par
(B. 29/7/’O9). The fact that (as mentioned by The Bul-
letin’s scribe) two Melbourne boys, of 14 and 12 re-
spectively, were recently found to be suffering from a
dreadful disease is proof positive to my right-thinking
mind that the male is always the tempter in these eases.
How could these ruffianly libertines possibly have got
into that predicament unless they took advantage of
some trusting young girl’s innocence? The circumstance
that the younger Don Juan actually led astray his own
governess makes his case particularly heinous, and
nothing but raising the age of consent will put a stop to
that sort of thing. And I do hope that if any wrong-
minded M.L.A., by way of amendment tries to insert in
the Bill a clause protecting immature boys from female
blandishment, the Field-Admiral will have him shot as a
spy by drum-head court-martial.

The latest news of the civil war at Wright-
ville (N.S.W.) is the appointment of an adminis-
trator by the Minister for Works. The row at
Wrightville, which is a hamlet near Cobar, started
on the subject of a nocturnal vehicle, which the
Minister declared a necessary adjunct to the
town’s civilisation. Wrightville refused to start
the nocturnal vehicle, and rather than be sanitary
the council resigned in a body. Further, the
populace decided that not one man would stand
for the position of councillor till the question of the
nocturnal vehicle was dropped. Now Solemn Lee
has appointed a municipal council in the person of
one man, who will be mayor and alderman all on
bis little own until a new council is elected. If
the ratepayers stick to their oath the one man will
just run things indefinitely. By way of further
protest, the ratepayers are going to refuse pay-
ment of their rates, and the administrator will
have to sue the whole district. This is a serious
matter; but Solemn Lee reckons that the noc-
turnal vehicle is essential, and sticks to his guns.
From “ 0.K.” : I would like to shout a
good word for Vic. Premier John Murray in his
character of temperance orator. Hearken to his
horse-sense views on the “Drink” subject:—
The man we want to get on our side is the moderate
drinker. I began by bein!r one myself, and then I went
over to the wrong side. The ranks of the drinkers are
recruited from the moderate party who hold the balance
of power.
John is on a good argument when he advocates
the preaching of teetotalism to youths. The
healthiest and most industrious young men one
meets are athletes who have never tried to acquire
a taste for alcohol or tobacco, and are equally
antipathetic to the Y.M.C. A. Theirs is a quite
unconscious virtue. They don’t need to wrestle
with the temptations of Beer and Smoke. Their
good humored contempt for their mates who have
acquired those pleasant vices is more convincing
in its negative way than the positive arguments
of even a liberal-minded reformer like Murray.
From an observance of their cases I have arrived
at a belief in the reasonableness of Murray’s pro-
posed Anti-Cigarette Bill. Assuming that men.
as a rule, would be more valuable citizens if thev
had never learned to smoke, I would have the
self-instruction of juvenile cigarette fiends made
illegal. If there be no way of suppressing
cigarette smoking among boys than by prohibit-
ing the sale of the goods, then I’d have cigarettes
put under the same ban as opium.
“An ex-Englishman” (candidly): “J.”
is quite right (8/7/’O9) about the moderate cleanli-
ness of the English student. I was at a public
school of repute, and had, before the swimming
bath was opened, a hot bath, in my turn, every
three weeks ! Afterwards, three swims a week ;
cold water, of course, and no soap. Later, I was
at Cambridge, and learned to use (and to refer to)
my morning “tub”—-two inches of water in a
large flat pan. And still no soap. I distinctly
remember a German undergraduate being regarded
as slightly eccentric because he soaped himself. I
admit frankly that I did not really understand
what personal cleanliness is till I came to Aus-
tralia. And the houses at a pound a week and
upwards with no bathroom or apology for one,
the dear old well-to-do people who had the kids
bathed on Saturday nights (but themselves, I
swear, never had a thorough wash from the
beginning of a year till the end)—are they still as
of old, I wonder, or have the last 20 years brought
in a more decent state of things all round ?
SOME STARTLED INQUIRIES REGARDING A
THREATENED TEETOTAL WHISKY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Professor Voyle, a Californian chemist, claims to have
perfected a whisky which exhilarates without intoxicat-
ing-.—Alarming news item.
Will the total abstainer abstain?
Will he sternly refuse and refrain
When the drink alcoholic
Only moves him to frolic,
And leaves not a cloud on his brain ?
Will he fly from the liquor accurst?
Will he reel with dismay? Will he burst
When he’s offered a whisky
That will just make him frisky,
Also quench his teetotaler’s thirst?
Will the total abstainer still tote
When the stuff that he pours down his throat
Isn’t really the tonic
Which once made him sardonic,
When the pub with statistics he smote?
Will he grieve for his pub-haunting past
When e’en he takes to liquor at last?
Will he throw off his winkers
And hooray with the drinkers,
While the out-of-date drunk stands aghast?
Will the devil that lurks in each keg
Shake a joyous and devilish leg
When, with some strange appliance,
He’s extracted by Science,
And there isn’t a bite in a “ peg ”?
Will this darned Prohibition fall flat ?
Will it throw up—or dance on—its hat
When a hogshead of liquor
Will not fuddle or shikker,
Or compel one to sleep on the mat?
It’s a problem much harder to sound
Than the one how to make things go round
For all time without dragging,
Pushing, shoving or nagging,
And it asks for reflection profound ;
But, in spite of the labors of Voyle—
Or a like scientific gargoyle—
When by cronies surrounded
And “ What’s yours?” is propounded,
I shall say as of old, “Fusel Oil 1 ”

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
July was the first month of the financial year of
all the States; and no very safe conclusions are to be
drawn from any one month’s figures. S. Australia,
which wakes up very gradually, clings to the habit of
issuing only quarterly returns ; the others show up like
this:—
July, 1908. July, 1909.
N. S. Wales .. £1,069,317 £963,188 Dec. £106,129
Victoria.. .. 605,230 627,185 Inc. 21,955
Queensland .. 407,304 359,834 Dec. 47,470
Westralia .. 161,089 153,790 Dec. 7,299
Tasmania .. 58,219 58,389 Inc. 170
The Commonwealth refunds are still shrinking. In the
first place, the Customs are collecting less, and in the
second place the Commonwealth needs more of what they
are collecting. In July, 1908, the collections totalled
£1,007,416 ; last month they were only £975,028.
Naturally New South Wales suffered most : it got
£106,992 less from the Commonwealth. The Ma State
has during much of its life suffered from a hybrid Free-
trade, and its manufactures made no progress worth
mentioning in spite of the State’s great natural advan-
tages. Now, under even moderate Protection, industries
are jumping ahead, imports are easing off, and the Cus-
toms haul is smaller. All round, however, there is the
expected shrinkage in imports; apart from coin, Aus-
tralia imported £478,075 less in the first half of 1909 than
in the first half of 1908. And even those figures don’t
indicate the fall in the import of the foreign goods that
carry the high duties, because there has been a large in-
crease in some of the others. Taking these things into
account, a beautiful mess the Commonwealth would be in
if it undertook anything in the shape of a fixed payment
to the States, though the local Premiers will no doubt ask
for it at the coming conference.
Expenditure figures are supplied by only three
States:—
Julv, 1908. Julv, 1909.
N. S. Wales .. £1,026,242 £1,100,935 Inc. £74,693
Queensland .. 255,723 268,459 Inc. 12,736
Westralia.. ' .. 209,379 210,735 Inc. 1,356
in every one of these three States there was a decrease in
revenue ; so, with an increased expenditure, the outlook
isn’t too pleasant. Things will clearly have to change
unless the year is to wind up with a procession of deficits.
Only N. S. Wales and Queensland give details of their
borrowings; and both are rushing along still harder
towards destruction. N.S.W. spent £223,789, or at the
rate of nearly £3,000,000 a year ; and Queensland, with
its mere handful of people, spent £99,054 on loan account.
Also in the Queensland case there is the heavy contingent
liability on account of the Chillagoe and other railways.

Besides the reserves included above there is an item—
“ Band: suspense account for dividend reserve fund.
£5-100.” This item is apparently' part of the profit made
on the sale of certain land to the Brisbane City Council
on terms ; though as it seems that all the money has now
been paid, it is not clear why the £5lOO should be kept in
suspense. The other reserves include gas-holder and
meter-renewal reserves : both are lumped in the £37,635.
Apart from these renewal reserves, some depreciation is
charged direct to profit and loss. But more lumping is
done here ; the one item on the expenditure side is “ To
manufacture, depreciation, etc., £13,565.” This is vague,
and suggests that the less the public knows about
the workings of the co. the better the directors
like it. And perhaps there’s a good reason for it.
It is significant, anyhow, that during the shocking
depression in Brisbane a few years ago, this
co. managed to squeeze out from 9 to 11J per cent.
Then, when things showed an improvement in Bris-
bane, the directors got out of a difficulty by capital-
ising £20,000 of reserves, making- shareholders a present
of one new share for every seven old ones. On the basis
of the old capital the present div. is equal to about 13J
per cent. Thus by capitalising the reserves the co.
mopped up more profits without startling the public by
announcing an increase in the already high rate of divi-
dend. Further movements: —

The sale of the Petrie’s Bight land at the end of 1902 brought
in £30,000, which accounts, of course, for most of the
increase in the holdings of cash, etc. Still, in the past
three years, in spite of large expenditure on plant, mains,
etc., cash and liquid assets have increased by £ssl®;
also sales of gas and residuals have grown rapidly.
Queensland has no doubt been having a remarkably good
time, and Brisbane has shared in it; but, even though
things ease off, this co. is undoubtedly in a fine position
to face any ordinary trouble. It got through very well
before, and it is in a still stronger position now—provided
always, of course, no unlooked-for competition springs up.

This co. is hanging between Heaven and earth. Twenty-
one years having passed since it got its Act, it was a
while ago faced with a note from the Perth City Council
that, in accordance with that Act, the municipality pro-
posed to take the business over. Then began a row over
the price. The co. wanted to be paid for its goodwill;
that is to say, though the co. had only £125,000 of capital
(and a great deal of that had been supplied by the con- *
suraers), it wanted about £300,000 for the concern.
Eventually the council offered £158,866, which was the
full book value of the works, land, buildings, etc.
As the co. wouldn’t agree to that, arbitration pro-
ceeded, and the result is not yet known. The
co. supplies both gas and electric light. Cutting up the
general assets proportionately between the two depart-
ments, the gas business showed for the past term a profit
an the rate of £l2 3s. percent., and the electric business
£lBBs. per cent, per annum. The revenue in both de-
partments has fallen off : so far as the electric depart-
ment is concerned this is probably due in part to small
reductions in price. The co.’s total liabilities, including
customers’ deposits, are £4981 ; the liquid assets on
May 31 were £8450. But all these are small matters com-
pared with the result of the arbitration ; for if the council
can resist the claim that it is liable to pay for goodwill—
that is, the right to supply itself—it will mean a dif-
ference to the shareholder of anything from £1 to nearly
£2 per share. Unfortunately, in, spite of warnings, scores
of investors in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney bought
shares which were unloaded on to them at high prices
from Perth when some of the people there smelt a rat in
the neighborhood. It isn’t pleasant to have to admit
that, as usual, several of the daily papers allowed their
long legs to be pulled and so helped to change the baby’s
nursegirls.

This co.’s profit and loss account, as published, consists
practically of the one item —“ Net profit on sales of gas,
etc., after allowing for depreciation, etc., £6133.” Even
the Australian (Sydney) Gas Co. at least, says what it re-
ceives from the sale of gas, etc. With that information
available it is possible to compare the fixed investment
(mains, plant, etc.) with the sales over a number of years,
and judge whether additions have been made to the
mains, plant, etc., out of profits. From the North Shore
Oo.’s accounts, as published, practically no conclusions
can be drawn —except that the management is desperately
anxious that the public shall know little or nothing of the
co.’s progress. Given honest directors and managers,
things may go on all right; but when this policy
is pursued under the other sort of management, it
becomes a comparatively easy matter to rob the public
and the shareholders. No Australian companies law is
all that it should be ; but the Victorian law is, at any
rate, so far ahead of the one in force in N. S. Wales that
if the North Shore Co. were in Melbourne it wouldn’t
dare to issue a document of this sort. When a co. issues
such accounts the only suggestion possible is that the
management wants to hide something. It may want to
hoodwink the public and the shareholders into believing
that the profits are either better or worse than they
really are. A dishonest management would do these
things for its own personal profit; but it isn’t necessary
to suggest anything of that kind in a case like this.
If profits are being hidden the object would probably be
to prevent an outcry for a cheaper service, or to throw a
wet blanket over any suggested competition. Nothing is
easier in an industrial concern, especially if it is growing
and prosperous, than to hide profits ; all it has to do is to
pay for new works out of current revenue. In this case the
public evidently assumes that this is being done ; hence
the fully-paid £3 shares, though paying only 8 per cent.,
are quoted at 415., thus returning the investor less than
4 per cent. But investors who assume these things may
be right or they may be wrong - . The only safe plan is to
make friends with"somebody who knows; and with a
public co. that sort of thing shouldn’t be neces-
sary. Nothing is more certain than that, through
these gas, water, ferry and other concerns, Private Enter-
prise is busy driving a whole packet of nails into its own
coffin ; for tens of thousands of people who would on the
whole prefer to pay Private Enterprise 5 or 6 per cent, for
the capital it puts into a business, will rise in rebellion
when they see that they have to pay interest, not on the
capital put into the business, but on three-times more
which the business never saw and from which it never
got and never will get a farthing’s worth of benefit.

This co. began in 1878 with a paid capital of only, £lO,OOO,
and has capitalised profits until the total is now £45,000,
being 6s. per share on 150,000 £1 shares. An unusual
course is adopted with regard to dividends, the total of
which has for many years past been made to equal the
amount of the discount or rebate which this and other
tariff cos. allow on premiums. The recent additions to
reserves have not been very rapid, chiefly on account of
the high rate of dividend. (In the foregoing this dividend
has been calculated on the total amount of capital paid
up, whether paid out of profits or otherwise.) In 1900 the
premiums totalled £37,235 ; the capital and reserves then
were £74,908. So capital and reserves were equal to 201
per cent, of the premiums. Now, with premiums
totalling £68,356, the funds amount to £96,764,
or equal to only 142 per cent, of the premiums.
During the past 18 months the co. has been doing acci-
dent, employers’ liabilty, and similar business; and, no
doubt, that class of risk does not call for the same
strength of reserves as fire business, in connection with
which the “ conflagration hazard ” is always a skeleton
in the cupboard. But making some allowance on this
account, it, is quite clear that the reserves have not in-
creased as rapidly as the premiums, and the premiums
are the only available measure of the risks. The move-
ments in some other respects have been as follows
Loss Expense

The loss rate is low and the expense rate is high, which
no doubt implies very careful selection of risks ; and this
ought to mean that this co. can do under ordinary cir-
cumstances with less reserves than other offices which
don’t winnow the risks so carefully. The loss rate has
moved up during the last couple of years. This is
probably - due mainly' to the new class of business. Still,
there is more gain in an underwriting profit of IS per
cent, on £68,000 than there is in one of 25 per cent, on
£40,000 ; so, as the management apparently sees, the
struggle after a low loss rate by accepting only
the very best risks can be carried too far. Of the
co.’s funds £67,153 is in city property and mortgages,
and £40,763 is in deposits and debentures. The average
return is just under 3£ per cent. ; but whether anything,
and, if so, how much, is charged for the co.’s own office
accommodation is not set out.

For some years before the above list opens the co. had
been paying only from 2J to 4 per cent. ; for profits were
light and depreciation had been heavy. There has, how-
ever, been a fairly steady growth during the last few
years:—

Expenses per cent.

Profits are erratic, and that in the case of a trustee co.
always suggests that the corpus commissions are not
spread out evenly. A trustee co. gets its chief revenue
from two sources—an annual commission on the income
of the trust estates and one commission on the capital
value, usually 2J per cent, in each case. An estate
worth £30,000 pays £7OO as corpus commission ; if it
yields even 5 per cent, interest, the annual commission is
only £37 10s. a year, or £375 in 10 years ; and the average
estate is wound up well within that time. Thus it will
be seen that the profits shown by a trustee co. depend
upon how it treats the corpus commission : whether it
credits itself with the lot when its work begins, or
whether it calculates how long the estate will be in hand
and spreads the corpus commission out over the whole
period. Different offices do different things ; so that
really it isn’t much use taking any trustee co.’s figures
for any one year. Besides its trustee business, this co.
owns and runs a safe deposit; but, for the better security
of beneficiaries, the whole of the co.’s capital, which
guarantees that the co. will do its work properly, is in
Government stock, while the bulk of its reserves are in
mortgages, “ investments ” —whatever that may mean—
and deposits. Expenses are high (they include an allow-
ance for rent, though not depreciation), hut the co. has a
very scattered field to work. Still it is a large field, and
there is only one other co. working in it.

This little co. has given up its old habit of issuing half-
yearly accounts. And it isn’t any more eloquent now 7
that it only opens the flood-gates once in 12 months.
Its capital is £lO,OOO ; its reserves are £9245. Very few
trustee cos. in the Commonwealth owe more than a few
pounds to the public—unpaid bills for new feather-
dusters and the like ; but this co. has “ sundry creditors,
£15,215.” In proportion to capital and reserves it isn’t a
tremendous amount; but a trustee co. should not be
permitted to take the hazard of raising and risking any
of the public’s money at all except for one purpose. It
is allowable for it to raise moneyho get a will probated,
and to advance the incidental expenses ; but for the rest
all its funds ought to be kept for the protection of
beneficiaries, and to guarantee the proper discharge of
its trusts. In most States this is the law ; and possibly
this Tasmanian co. has incurred its debt for this or a
similar purpose. Its accounts are, however, presented
in such a vague way that nothing definite can be said
about the matter. , The assets include £6002 on deposit,
£7833 on mortgage or in properties, and £21,045 “ sundry
debtors ” —which is also vague. The profits amount for the
year to £9 ss. Id. percent, on the capital and reserves com-
bined. They would, of course, be very large profits in
any other business; but some allowance must be made
for the fact that a trustee co.- is always more or less liable
to be bumped heavily through a perfectly innocent mis-
reading of the dead man’s instructions.

Sydney has made great strides during the last seven
years ; but this co. hasn’t kept pace with Sydney, mainly
because its electrical competitors have been getting in its
way all the time. This shows the total outlay on plant,

In spite of the considerable outlay on works, into which
all the reserve additions and a bit over have been put,
the profits of seven years ago have not been quite sus-
tained. Nominally, the reserves stand at £27,787. But
on the other side there is a paper asset, “ Parliamentary
rights and concessions, £15,000.” This is a goodwill item,
and is therefore disregarded in the table above. But,
besides that, the whole of the plant, mains and water
supply (including lease) are taken in at cost; and, in
spite of repairs, there must be some general depreciation.
Though the income and profit have not increased, so
much has been spent on additions or renewals and repairs
that the financial position is not as good as it was seven
years ago:—

The co. can’t pay more than 10 per cent, without hand-
ing over to the Sydney City Council as much as
it pays its own shareholders in excess of 10 per
cent. ; but the question of surplus profits isn’t
likely 7 to be troubling it much just now. If it had
more, the co. could very easily dispose of it by writing
down its assets or strengthening its reserves, for both of
these things could stand more attention without col-
lapsing under the weight of it. The dividend is doubtless
being earned, taking one half-year with another ; but the
margin, after allowing for depreciation, must be narrow.

The dividend is Is. 9d. on the shares paid to 15s. The co. is
an offshoot from the Hydraulic Power Go., and the
question was once formally raised whether the City
Council was not entitled to receive a bonus equal to any
dividend in excess of 10 per cent, paid by this co., as
well as by the parent; but apparently the matter was
allowed to drop. The profits seem to" be stated gross ;
that is to say, the reserves are the only provision there is
against general depreciation. Repairs and renewals so
far appear, however, to have been charged up to working
account, though one can’t be absolutely certain as to
renewals. A plant renewal fund ought to exist to provide
for future renewals ; but it is possible that the cost of
renewals already paid for is added to the assets side of
the balance-sheet, instead of being charged to profits or
written-off the renewal reserve fund. If so, then, of
course, both the profits and the reserves are swollen
beyond their true size. The total paid capital is £22,500 ;
previous to 1907 it was £15,000. The total book value of
property, building, plant, stock, etc., is £27,259; so
the reserves ought to be more than ample to
cover depreciation. The business is highly profit-
able. No doubt a good deal of its work is
provided by the Hydraulic Power Co. ; and as that
co.’s outlook isn’t so brilliant on account of electrical
competition, it is possible that, sooner or latter, that co.
will beat down this co.’s prices. Apart from that there
don’t appear to be any large flies in this co.’s rich
ointment.

And being in the unique position of having almost all its
reserves in cash, this co., which paid back 5/- in the £ of
capital early in 1907, proceeds to pay back another 10/-,
whereupon the shares will be only 5/- paid. Certainly
there are special circumstances. The co. was given a
28-years run by Act, and 19 of those years have passed.
At the end of the other nine it must hand over the whole
undertaking to the State and get only a receipt in return.
Profits have slumped badly during the half-year. This
was partly due to the Broken Hill mine lock-out; partly
to the weir being raised (this work was charged up to profit
and loss); and partly to a recent reduction in the prieA
from 5/- to 4/2 per 1000 gallons on condition that the
mining cos. dropped their agitation fb'r a supple-
mentary water supply. The mining cos. used to pay
for their water according to a sliding scale ; but
when the abortive B. H. Water Trust was formed, over
two years ago, the Water Co. blandly announced that it
had to make all the hay it could before its sun was
hauled down, and so the sliding scale was abolished.
That accounts for the very high profits in 1907-8, which
consequently must not be taken for a precedent. The
co. will, of course, do as little as it can to the works
during the next nine years ; but the chances are, never-
theless, that, merely to enable it to keep going, it will
have to do more than it has done during the past nine.
It is significant that, for the past half-year (vide directors’
report), “the charges for maintenance are unusually
heavy, and include renewal of rising main between the
2j-mile and 3-mile sections.” The co. has in cash and
liquid form £127,287 over and above liabilities.
The 10s. per share repayment will mop up
£lOO,OOO, leaving £27,287. There are also in hand
assets to which apparently the State will not become en-
titled : these may be valued at (say) £25,000. So the co.
has in hand, in cash or convertible assets, practically all
its capital. On £50,000 (the remaining capital) the 10 per
cent. div. will call for only £2500 per half-year. If the
profits remain at even £12,500 per half-year, the surplus
(£10,000) accumulated at 4 per cent, would amount to
about £211,500 by the end of nine years, or over 21s. per
share. The ss. shares are selling at about 165., and at
that price the 10 per cent. div. meansonly a £3 2s. 6d. per
cent, return. Even so, however, unless something unex-
pectedly bad happens to Broken Hill or to these works,
the outlook for shareholders is pretty cheerful. What it
is for Broken Hill is another matter.

For some unexplained reason, traffic has been light
during the past half-year. Hence the fall in profits. It
may be drought—it usually is in that part, which is given
up mainly to the squatter and the smaller wool-grower,
the two people who nowadays are most severely smitten
"by drought when it does happen. The wheat-farmer used
to suffer quite as much ; but by artificial manuring, etc.,
he is making 12in. or 15in. of wet go quite as far as 20in. or
25in. used to. Anyway, however it was caused, this co.’s
traffic slumped:—

Fortunately in the recent good years, having got into the
habit of paying very small divs. in the bad ones (includ-
ing nothing at all in 1900), the co. put by a very respect-
able sum, and has now got its debenture debt,back to
£20,000. For many years, down to 1905, this 4 per cent,
debt stood at £30,000; and 15 years ago it was £40,000.
The co. is therefore in a better position now to face any
temporary trouble than it was when Cohen used to call
regularly' for his £l6OO or (later on) his £l2OO a year,

shares, and partly in contributing shares paid to 15s. By
1899 the fully paid shares had been writte.- down to

In the calculation of working costs in concen-
trating mills and workshops, every small item should be
taken into consideration. It is the small and uncon-
sidered factors, involving waste of power, that make for
high working costs. The type of bearing employed has a
marked effect on the power consumed in overcoming
friction. Recent exhaustive tests emphasised the marked
superiority of the Hyatt Flexible Roller Bearings over all
other types of roller, sleeve, and other anti-friction
bearings. Under equal conditions the loss of power due
to friction in Hyatt Flexibles is 23 per cent, less than
with the best solid roller bearing, and 65 per cent, less
that with babbit metal journals. Messrs. W. and J.
Lempriere, 506 Little Collins Street, Melbourne, will be

superintendent, and has many features of excellence and
novelty in the detail of its construction. The jackets are
made interchangeable, only one type and size of jacket
being used ; and they will further be constructed so that
they are reversible from top to bottom —thus practically
the life of the jackets is doubled. This furnace, as well as
the previous one, was built at the works of the Austral

In 1905, in spite of all the writing down, the old brewery
premises, with plant, stood at £31,000 in the books ; then
the land and buildings were sold for £16,250, and that
meant more writing down. New premises w’ere built, and
that explains most of the subsequent spring in the property
item. The capital is now' very small, both absolutely and
in proportion to liabilities and risks ; and it ought to be
increased, especially as the trade seems to be growing
pretty fast. Unfortunately, on account of the mopping
up of profits by the vague contingency account, there is
a doubt as to the real value of the assets ; and there is
also a goodwill item of unspecified size. Apart from
these things, the outlook is distinctly encouraging.
Broken Hill South made a net profit of £36,053
for the past half-year, of which £4032 was from zinc
tailings. In the previous term the net profit was £30,323
from ore and £lO,OOO from tailings. Ore treated was
137,839 tons, so the net profit w r as 4s. per ton of ore,
plus the value of the tailings produced. From this ore
41,563 tons of zinc tailings were produced ; valuing these
at 3s. 9d. per ton (the price now being paid by the De
Bavay Co.), it adds Is. ljd. per ton to the value of the
ore ; total ss. 9d. The reserves are estimated at 3,250,000
tons = £934,375, taking the profit at 6s. 9d. per ton. The
tailings, slimes, etc., on hand exceed 1,200,000 tons.
At only 3s. per ton they would be worth £lBO,OOO.
The surplus of liquid assets is £58,000. Total of
the three items, £1,172,375. There are 200,000 shares,
and on this calculation they are worth £5 17s. 2d., which
is a shade above the present price. Everything depends,
however, upon the markets for lead and zinc. Lead
averaged £l3 ss. 4d. last half-year, and it has been over
£7 higher and about £4 ss. lower than that within the
last 14 years.

At Wyalong (N.S.W.), the True Blue is now
down to 1300 ft. on a little mineral stone worth from soz. to
lOoz. gold ; but it is badly in need of milling ore to keep
the pot boiling. The old Shamrock, which has not been
heard of for a time, is again a producer. Recently the
co. commenced to open out at 600 ft., and the first parcel
of 2 tons sent to Cockle Creek has yielded 14Joz. per ton.
At the same works, the Golden Fleece co. got 460 z. from
15 tons.

The second half-yearly report of the Tewksbury
Proprietary is out. This is the concern that w'as floated
by J. O. Watson and Tewksbury, the Victorian dredging
engineer, to work along the Shoalhaven (N.S.W.). So far
only preliminary w'ork has been done: 500 acres out of
the co.’s 1000 have been prospected. “ Such parts of the
property as have so far been proved payable ” average
4’4d. per yard ; but managing-director Tewksbury doesn’t
say what the payable parts amount to, though area isn’t
much less important than yield. Three of the biggest
dredges in N.S.W. are being built; the first one, to work
about eight miles from Braidwood, will be ready by about
the end of the year ; and two more ought to be going
within 12 months from now. Costs, it is estimated, will
be about l£d. per yard. The co. paid £25,000 in ordinary
£1 shares for the property; and there are 45,000 pref.
shares, now paid to 11s. Over £15,000 cash is in hand,
and £6182 had been paid on account of plant on June 30.
Monthly calls are being made, and it is reckoned that all
the capital will be needed to pay for the plant. The
chances, in fact, are that a few more shares will have to
be sent to market; the co. has the right to issue 100,000
altogether.

Conrad Stannite mine (N.S.W.), out of whose
horribly complex ore veteran John Howell failed to knock
profits after he quitted the Broken Hill Prop., is still
under suspension ; but its time will be up in a couple of
months. A manager, engineer and shift boss are about
all the staff : they have been straightening things up in
case money should be available for a start. There is a
fine surface equipment, with two shafts down 450 ft., and
winzes deeper ; but the stuff has tied the metallurgists in
knots. There has been some talk lately of the Great
Cobar people taking it over—as though they hadn’t got
troubles enough of their own.

Hannan’s Star Co. (W.A.) claims in its report
for 1908 that prospects have materially improved by the
location of the Chaffers shoot in the northern part of the
property, and is hopeful that things will hum by and bye.
The year ends with £3978 on the wrong side of revenue
account, of which the expenditure for “ new property in-
vestigation,” option on Boulder Deep Level shares, and
depreciation amount to £3016. Proposed amalgamation
with the Boulder Deep Levels, in which the co. holds
62,381 out of 140,000 issued shares, is briefly touched on ;
in the opinion of the Board the marriage is essential.
The arrangement for working the two properties as one
has been carried out with satisfactory results for some
time, and, according to the management, the work now
in hand promises to considerably add to the combined ore
reserves. The cash balance of the Star Co. on December
31 was £17,679, and the Deep Level shares were valued in
the balance-sheet at £9617.

Boulder Main Reef (W.A.) held a meeting in
London on June 30, when the chairman reviewed the
work done since the reorganisation in October, 1907.
The management still had visions, he said, of cutting the
continuation of the Boulder lode between the present
bottom workings at 2300 ft. and 3000 ft. ; and he reminded
shareholders that Lionel Robinson and Co. had given
£7500 for 30,000 reserve shares, and thus replenished the
co.’s almost exhausted stock of spending silver. This
contribution gives Robinson and party the right to take
up the balance of the unissued scrip, but so far they
haven’t rushed the option. The balance-sheet shows that
the co. was close to the rocks on Feb. 28 ; but since then
it has received the windfall mentioned above. All that,
however, has gone, and Robinson has also advanced £7OOO
on mortgage.

Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) winds up the series of
9d. dividends by a distribution on Sept. 29, after which it
intends to again pay Is. per quarter. No official announce-
ment has been made as to how long the recently increased
return is to be left at £22,000, but it will probably remain
stationary for another couple of years at least. Mine is
looking very attractive, and is by far the best-conditioned
in 8., M. and Co.’s western stable.
*** * 1 :
South Kalgurli steadily improves down to
1000 ft., but in the two levels below that point it still looks
rather sick. Reserves, however, must now be three or
four years ahead of the mill, so, if the worst happens,
there will, with the £50,000 odd in hand, be something for
shareholders to divide. Owing to differences with the
London Board (which isn’t the easiest in the world to get
on with), 8., M. and Co. give up the management on Octo-
ber 1, and will be succeeded by John Morgans, present
superintendent of the Oroya-Brown Hill.

: For the year ended March 31, Associated Gold
Mines, Ltd. (W.A.), crushed 125,794 tons for £262,397.
Working costs averaged 20s. sd. per ton, but the net sur-
plus figures are not yet available. An interesting feature
of the year’s work was the opening up of anew shoot
close to No. 11 shaft, and it is estimated that a little
under 60,000 tons of lldwt. ore have already been blocked
out above the No. 2 level. This formation is reckoned to
be the upper extension of the Australia East lode, which
was worked between the No. 9 and No. 17 levels, and the
co. is getting ready to see if this guess is right. Another
item of information to which special attention is drawn
in the manager’s report is the satisfactory shaping of the
new lens of ore lying north of the old shoot, ana proved
between the Nos. 14 and 17 levels ; from this body the co.
expects to win a big tonnage of Bdwt. ore and over. The
mine added £31,500 to its reserves during the 12 months,
but somehow dividends don’t get a move on. Until they
do there isn’t much inducement to trade in the stock at
the present market price.
The Associated held its annual meeting in
London on the 21st ult., when manager Roberts, who
blew in from the West a few days previously, was on
exhibition. Roberts carried across one or two proposals
for spending more money on plant, but as the cable hasn’t
mentioned that he was tossed out or howled down, the
chances are that he got the tip from someone to keep his
proposals dark. Herman Landau once told share-
holders from the chair that it would have been cheaper
for the co. to have burnt a bank note for half a million
sterling than have been saddled with the plant; and as it
has been remodelbd and patched from head to foot
several times since then, it is no wonder that Roberts’
friends were in terror lest he should “put his foot into
it,” and be violently assaulted for his mistake. It is only
lion-tamers who would dare to advocate more plant
expenditure at an Associated meeting nowadays.

Mt. Morgan (Queensland) comes along with a
return of £100,300 for July. In all, 20,530 tons of ore
were smelted for 702 tons copperand 92170 z. gold. Copper
(at £59) gave £41,418, and gold £36,868, making a total of
£78,286 from the smelters. The copper furnaces produced
78 per cent, of the total yield, which shows how things
have changed. The feature of the return is that the
auriferous copper ore gave an average extraction of 765.
per ton, which is fully 20s. a ton better than any recent
return. Profits will, of course, follow the improved quality
of the ore, most of which came from the 750 ft. level.
It has often been alleged that the gold values will pay for
the cost of treatment; but the annual report shows that
costs absorbed more than two-thirds of the total gross
value (more than £600,000 out of £900,000), and that the
profit (£228,215) didn’t even equal the gold in the blister
copper (£290,000); so it took all the gold from the chlori-
nation works, all the copper from the smelters, and some
of the gold associated with the latter to pay expenses,
which no doubt were a bit heavier than usual owing
to the creep. With its heavy costs Mount Morgan
requires now and then a smelting return worth 765. per
ton of ore just to pick up the financial leeway.
* • * *
Stannary Hills, the mostly-Adelaide co. which
owns four or five tin mines and the usual expensive tram-
way in North Queensland, has been hard up against
trouble for close on three years. Nohow could it pay on
its absurd capitalisation ; but the 640,000 shares have
now been cut down from £1 to 2s. 6d. Manager Nicholas
argued with the directors that the only chance was to
reorganise the whole plan of operations, so as to make the
low-grade ore profitable. They agreed, and a heap of
dead work has been done. A new shaft has been sunk
500 ft. in the Ivanhoe. It is down the hill from the old
shaft, and by driving at 500 ft. towards the old shaft,
they will get 100 ft. of backs in ore proved by a
winze from the old workings. They took out
31,000 tons of 4 per cent, ore from these old workings,
and the 100 ft. of backs ought to provide another
10,000 tons. As stoping goes on the shaft will be con-
tinued. The other claims which will have attention are
the Extended, Kitchener, Central Hill, and Black Rock.
To tap these at various depths, running down to about
600 ft., a tunnel has been driven 2400 ft. The tramway
runs into this working, and ore can be sent by it to the
Walsh mill for from Is. to Is. 6d. per ton. Most of the
richer ore has, no doubt, been got out above the tunnel
level ; but at the surface of the Central Hill there is a
large deposit of stone going a few points over lper cent.;
and 1000 tons have been treated for the purpose of arriv-
ing at costs, etc. This stuff is shot down the shaft and
trucked direct. Costs are reckoned: Breaking, Is.;
railage. Is. 6d.; milling, ss. ; miscellaneous, 6d.; total,
Bs. If it can be done for that, a per cent, extraction
would pay, which would be something remarkable for
North Queensland. C. E. Nicholas will deserve a heap of
credit if he can work up to these figures.
The Stannary mill has been completely over-
hauled, and should be at work now in, say, six” weeks.
They expect to draw about 300 tons a week from the
Ivanhoe, 700 tons from the Central Hill, and 200 tons
of 1£ p,c. ore from the Kitchener and others. Some of it
may come from the Black Rock, where there is a big body
worth about that much. They thus figure on getting
19 tons of oxide a week—say 80 tons a month. So long
as tin is worth about £132, the Stannary oxide should
bring in £BO, which would give the co. £6400 a month
from about 5100 tons of ore. With the new shaft and the
rock drills, etc., mining at even the Ivanhoe is reckoned
at only 10s. ; other costs may be 7s. 6d. or Bs. On trials
that have been made they figure that £3500 a month will
cover costs. The co. owes £60,000 on 6 p.c. debentures,
£BOOO on 10 p.c. debentures, and about £12,000
on other accounts, which is costing an average of
10 per cent. The interest bill is, therefore, £5600 a year.
Add that, or £465 a month, to costs ; and there is a profit
of nearly £2400 a month. This is based on—(1) an ex-
traction of 3 per cent, from the Ivanhoe, 1 per cent from
the Central Hill, and 1J per cent, from other ore ; (2) a
weekly mill duty of 1200 tons ; (3) the oxide being worth
£BO, which means about £l3O for tin; (4) costs averaging
13s. Bd. per ton. Any variation from these conditions
will, of course, affect the result. If they can be realised
the co. will make an excellent recovery. So far as share-
holders are concerned, their other trouble is the debt
burden. The 10 per cent, load—£2o,ooo of it—will have
to be got rid of; and that will take close on 12 months
even if these figures as to profit are realised. It may
take more, in fact, as no doubt something will be done
towards providing a sinking fund to wipe out the main
debenture debt, which, however, does not mature for 14
years. And all the time the mill will be eating up over
5000 tons per month.
* • • *
After being practically a non-producer for
months, the jVulcan (Q.), Australia’s deepest tin mine,
ought to be heard from in about three weeks. Tr- .ely the
Irvinebank mill has been treating little lots from outside,
but none for the Vulcan. In the upper levels stone worth
6 per cent, and thereabouts is, however, ready for break-
ing down ; and this will be put through while they drive
for the lode at 1450 ft. A winze has been put down from
the disappointing 1050 ft. level to 1250 ft., and in three or
four weeks payable ore will be coming from this point.
How long the mill will run depends, of course, mainly on
the 1450 ft. developments; but, meantime, things at the
Vulcan are far more cheerful.

So far the bore hole from the No. 10 level of
Mills’ United, Charters Towers, has not cut the Brilliant
or any other formation. The Brilliant reef was never
much good in the Mexican or N.B. Freeholds, and several
blocks of ground were lec to tributors; but conditions
don t always get worse at increased depths, as the Bril-
liant Extended has shown. Pfeiffer’s Day Dawn is sinking
an underlay below No. 9, and, although the prospects are
not good, thereisabigformationcarryingalittlemineral.
Altogether, Charters Towers’deep levels are getting more
of a trial than they ever had before. Kelly’s Queen
Block, which is situated near the shaft going down on
the Brilliant St. George, has gained a speculative value ;
but this is simply because of its position. The Victory'
crushed 179 tons for £1658, all, however, from small veins
that can’t be relied upon. Numbers of Towers’ shows
are of this class, though the Victory has such an irregular
shaped block that it also got a rich portion of the big
Brilliant formation.

Adelaide shareholders, who hold more than half
the shares in the O.K. Co. (Q.), dropped a requisition in
to local director S. E. Beach the other week, asking him
to secure answers to a series of questions. The local
director went north and saw the Board. Among other
things he was told that, after all engagements and lia-
bilities have been paid, the new co. will have £lB,OOO in
hand, apart from the call that may be made, and £lO,OOO
of this will be ear-marked for prospecting. Some time
ago drills found a body of basic ore at 500 ft., and the
Adelaide shareholders wanted to know what was
to be done with this. The Board says a shaft
will be sunk at once to reach it, and it should
be available in 15 months; meantime the co.
will have enough ore to go on with, as there
are other bodies more easily got at, including one struck
at 115 ft., and now' (at 200 ft.) worth 4 per cent., though it
was only worth 1 j>er cent, at the apex. It is alleged
that blister copper is being produced at £46 per ton. The
shares in the new c 6. were under-written, so there is no
doubt about the funds being available to give the mine a
chance of a second life. In its first life it paid just upon
£lOO,OOO in divs. and provided almost every pennyworth
of its own equipment.
• * * #
Up at Cloncurry (0..), the belief is that Mount
Elliott will shortly pay off all hands, and that manager
Corbould will remodel the plant and increase its capacity,
only making a fresh start when the railway is finished.
On the mine there must be close-up £60,000 worth of
copper and matte. For the last half of May the smelter
produced 136 tons of copper. For June, the production
was equal to 365 tons of blister. For July’, judging by
the stack of blister copper now at grass, the output
should exceed that of June. The extraction so far has
averaged about 13 per cent., so allowing, say, 1 per cent,
for loss in slag, converting, etc., the ore shows 14 per
cent, or over; and there has been no picking. The
management has done much less than it should in
driving and sinking, and if it has any kick left it will
grab this opportunity to push on development work.

Be the right to make a personal search of miners,
recently asked for by an owners’ deputation, Mr. H. E.
Rowe, of the Vic. Chamber of Mines, writes some more ; but
it’s his bad luck that he does it at a time when this column
is crowded worse than usual. Still, he is more or less en-
titled to this reply to the suggestion that directors ought
to be searched as well as miners, since some directors are
admittedly dishonest: “If directors defraud a co. it is by
selling to it machinery or stores at more than their
market value, and the Chamber of Mines is doing
its best to stop all such practices by legislation.
There would be no points in searching the per-
sons or clothes of directors to recover such profits.”
The same writer mentions that, prior to the passing of
the Gold Buyers Act, it was proved that £150,000 had in
one year been sold to private buyers in Bendigo ; and
near the mines it was common to see the sign: “Gold
Bought—Strictest Secrecy.” This, however, hasn’t much
to do with the case, because the Act has knocked out that
sort of thing ; and when the other States pass a similar
Act, as promised, the whole gold-stealing business will be
just about wiped out. Anyhow, the owners might well
have waited to see what inter-State action would do
before even suggesting the other piece of degradation.

Proctor retires from the Star of the East,
Ballarat, after along innings. Whether that means a left-
handed hit at Sewell is not told. If so, it is not apparent
that the blow has got home. Proctor’s successor is Bell,
who handled one of the Duke shows at Bamganie, when
the Gilpin party was in strength. Bell should know
his work ; but the Star isn’t a Duke of Wellington or a
Duke of York. It is a vast mine and wants big handling;
and it isn’t everybody that has the capacity to get its
measure. Bell, to ring true, will have to mine hard. He
wants to be sure when he reports payable stone that it is
not of the ordinary Ballarat “ payable make,” but that it
will give a profit. If he be the wise man they say, he will
first size up the mine, report his views to the Board, and
then fear no devil. There isn’t much chance that he will
make a reputation at the Star by mining, but he won’t
do himself harm if he works on these lines.

Mcßride, Victorian Minister of Mines, has
bought Warrandyte a battery of five 6001 b. stamps to serve
the mining requirements of that much-scratched dis-
trict. Before doing this he may have measured up the
capacity of the field ; if not, he had better look up the
reports of his department to find out the Warrandyte
record. This will be a little more trying than blowing
rings of cigar smoke, but it will be a heap more
profitable to the public purse, which won’t long
stand the running of State batteries on 3dwt.
stuff. Mcßride evidently imagines that, because he
is flinging about £4OOO a month out of the State’s
mining grant, he is working wonders. In the majority of
cases he is really only helping a lot of dead-beat specula-
tions to crawl on a little bit longer, when the greatest act
of kindness would be to shove them into Paradise at once.
Of that sort was the Lady Nelson, of St. Arnaud. How-
ever, in that case the Cabinet vetoed a grant—but it isn’t
safe to chaff Mcßride about that.

Where has Ekberg, Ph.D., M.Arn. 1.M.E.,
been since the days when, full-bearded as a pard, he
wended his way round North Lyell, Lyell Consols, and all
the other claims of the Lyell fields ? There was a glimpse
of him in Victoria, another in South Africa, another in
Westralia. Now he emerges still smiling and urbane.
With him come Hector MacDonald, another good old
North Lyell identity, and Langford. The trio are the big
bugs of the Mount Balfour mine (Tas.); and Ekberg
naturally falls into the position of reporter, as of
yore. So far not much has been done at Mount
Balfour, but Ekberg sees £117,000 of copper there,
with a bit over because of rich discards, not
counted in. This isn’t bad for any prospecting show, so
Ekberg declares that “the Mount Balfour Copper Mine
at this stage of development is the best proposition I
have seen.” Shades of North Lyell ! That the rich
bornite of that wonderful claim should be placed in the
second row of copper finds is enough to rouse Crotty and
Lonergan from their graves to trounce their old friend.
But the public wants costs from Ekberg. Old ladies
always ask that question when looking at a bride’s
trousseau ; and that is just about the position of the
Mount Balfour. It is a virgin claim, with only
a tunnel to the formation, a shaft down to the tunnel,
and one or two short drives on the course of the lode.
This last is highly silicious, and specimens look very
pretty. So did those from Gippsland, and Ekberg’s
assays weren’t in it with the Victorian figures. But the
Gippsland stuff didn’t live down, and only the specimens
live to tell a tale of wasted effort.

Tongkah tin is still supplying the great Aus-
tralian gamble. Mine-engineer Freeman, a very careful
man with a first-class reputation, visited the mine, and
furnished a report; but, instead of telling its contents,
the management set to work to discount its importance
before publishing it. The management has been guilty
of a few extraordinary things, and this isn’t the least extra-
ordinary. It is well known that Freeman’s opinion is that
the claim is of great value, but that the co. has also
undertaken a big contract in return for the concession,
viz., to dredge out a channel and a dock, and to build
retaining walls. That work has to be done within six
years from the. granting of the concession. Three of those
years have passed and the work has not been touched ;
and if it is a big work, and, on account of the delay, isn’t
done within three years, then the whole title will be
in peril. Freeman deserved well of the directors for
stressing this point; but evidently it hasn’t pleased
them. It really oughtn’t to matter two straws to
the directors what shares are worth ; but so far they
seem to have been more concerned about the market
than the mine.

mated with the Cobar as the Great Cobar. (2) Act came

dredging if you want to invest your money that way;
but, if you should want cash, you may find a difficulty in
realising, because with few exceptions brokers give
dredging shares the cold shoulder. They regard most
dredge shares as lock-ups, and they naturally don’t like
lock-ups Constant S. (Dalby) : The Department replies
that work has not started and that labor is over-plentiful.

“Starfish”: Whilst other N.S.W. and
Victorian rivers of any consequence are up and
doing good business, the waters of.the Darling are
down and out. The Big Trickle is a sorry-looking
trickle just now', and doesn’t trick worth 9d. It
looks more like a drain than the fine stream it
should be. There are reports of a rise in the
Barwon, and we may expect, a sort of a river some
time. That rise will come and pass,l ike aslieepin the
night, and it will be flowing always onward to the
Murray, thence to the all-devouring ocean, which
will suck it out of sight. The rises of the Darling
are erratic and quite unlike those of most N.S.W.
and Victorian rivers, which obtain their waters
regularly from snow-capped and other mountain
regions. The Darling depends on the tropical
rains in low'er Queensland and nor’-eastern
and nor’-western N.S.W. It is sometimes
a banker in summer and often a bankrupt in
winter. Why not lock it ? When the Darling is
down, stores for the middle and lower river are
carted from Broken Hill. The rate of carriage is
£5 a ton per 100 miles. A great deal of this
sfcrngglement is done on camels. The Afghans
have almost a monopoly of the camel-carrying
system. There is even an Afghans’ carrying union
in Broken Hill. With the river properly
locked, it would be navigable all the year
round. The waters now running to waste could
he used for irrigation purposes. Steamboats
would ply their trade all the time, instead of
remaining tethered, like a horse outside a public-
house, more than half the year. This would give
constant and healthy employment to hundreds of
river-boat hands, and scores of skippers and
engineers. Then the cocky sheep farmers (not a
wealthy lot on the Trickle) would be able to pur-
chase their goods at a minimum rate of freight,
and the goods would arrive in fair order and
clean. The smell of a camel doesn’t tend to
purify of improve flour and such like necessary
portions of an Outbacker’s commissariat.

had to be got to the camp headquarters. The
bush track was long and inaccessible for
heavy goods, and the only way was per
canoe by the swift-flowing Waitotara River.
The Maoris foresaw the difficulties ahead ; they
beached all the canoes and leisurely awaited
developments. For two days Brown Brother
hung about, and for two more days much of him
held comprehensive koreros. Meanwhile no flour
rose in the east. Attempts were made to shove
heavy goods up the mountains, but thegoods simply
fell back. The surveyors in charge recognised
that they were on the horns of a dilemma —they
understood the Maori. Eventually there was
nothing for it but to approach the brown man and
his wahine. Said the surveyor boss : “How much
a trip?” (the water distance was only a mile).
“Two pounds ten,” said Henare brassily. And
the surveyor boss chuckled: “Garn, we don’t
- want to buy your bloomin’ mud punt.” But
Henare wouldn’t shift —the price had been fixed a
fortnight previously. The boss tried a new lay :
“How much to borrow him, eh?” “Ten shilling
atrip,” came the reply. “What! 10s.?” said
the boss; “I’ll give you 55.” “No, no, pakeha,
10s. ; canoe very valuable; you might break him—
-10s.” Henare persisted ; but the boss wouldn’t
budge, so the canoe was offered him for sale.
“How much?” “A hundred pounds.” Later
the combine burst, but even then the brown man
got £llss. per canoe load of one ton. There’ll be
a heavy tangi thereabouts when Henare and his
fat wahine are paid off.

“Dick K.” : Jie “ Yarrum ” on the col-
laboration of whiskers and cursing. I once knew
a bullocky who could swear some ; but he, alas,
is now dead. His name was Hoppy Duneen, and
he grew no whiskers to speak of, as the heat gene-
rated by his profanity
singed them off. When at
his best, Hoppy’s lurid
outbursts w'ould have shifted
the Australian Public Debts
if he had got close enough,
and have scared capital out
of the country. Hoppy’s
end came about in this
fashion. His team got stuck
with a load of posts, and
Hoppy cursed with ground
and lofty curses till the
bullocks dropped dead and
the. load caught fire. En-
raged by this fresh catas-
trophe, Duneen gave vent
to such a magnificent flow of
variegated blasphemy that
he caught tire himself, and
was burnt to cinders. His
friends bad a tombstone
placed over his remains with
the following in-
scribed thereon :—“ What
is life? It is even a vapor, which appeareth for
a little while, and then vanisheth.”

“ Fraulein ” also writes from the flooded
part of Victoria :
My goodness ! I am sorry for “ Boh,” your recent cor-
respondent. No mistake, lam sorry for her. It has
been raining-100 weeks here also, and the man who brings
the clean clothes does not even wear a hunted-devil look
—it is too wet to put on. Also there is no man, and the
clean clothes are dirt}'. They have been swishing- about
on the clothes line for days and days, and no one will ever
■ know his or her own garments again. Everything in the
house has been read 50 times, and there is no library to
go to. Papers three and four years old are dragged from
their dusty lairs and read and re-read. We get the mail
once a week—if the coach comes. We swim to the stable
with our snake boots tied round our necks to saddle a
horse, and bring him up to the garden gate. Then after
we change our boots, we are wet again before we can get
into the saddle. Wet ! We’re always wet, and our feet
are clammy, like the tail of a mermaid. At intervals,
gio-ahtic oilskin-clad figures—even unto oilskin verandahs
to* their hats—come in carrying half-drowned lambs,
which are regaled with warm whisky, rolled in warm bags
and put near the kitchen fire, where they lie about in a state
of intoxication. We receive cheerful items of news such
as ■ “ Another old ewe drowned in the drain,” “ Ten
lambs pegged out last night,” “The blooming old cow
lost her rug in the swamp again.” We also hear that
198 points of rain fell last night. As for paying calls,
we’d as soon think of paying our debts. If we ventured
to go calling, Die following par would appear in our
paper : “ A female lunatic was seen riding on Wednesday
afternoon at the swamp, near McHaggis’s turning, and
grave fears are entertained as to her safety. the
weather clear up, a search party will go out.” Bah !
A DESERVING CASE.
PARSON: "Friend, I hare not touched a drop of
intoxicating liquor for FOURTEEN years."
BOOSKY SWAGMAN (paralysed): “Fourteen
years h-!!! Blime, have one now."
‘ ‘ Boswell ” : The tick question has reached
an acute stage in the North Cow district of
N.S.W. The eow worshippers are alarmed. The
auctioneer tells you, with a quaver in his voice,
that he would be doing great biz only for ‘"this
blanky tick.” The storekeeper tunes his flute in
the same key. The ordinary cow-spanking cocky
tears the hayseed from his beard and wails aloud
at his hard luck. “ Just as I was gettin’ solid too,
Mister.” Lonely watchers keep their vigil at
quarantine gates on all sorts of roads and murmur
“ Let us spray,” like Norman Lindsay's parson.
Stock inspectors buzz from post to post looking
for weak spots in the line of defence. Their halo
of glory has departed, and their headquarters are
now vulgarly called “the Tick Office.” Family
dissensions on the farms formerly raged round the
question of milking 12 cows or upwards per hour.
Now the question is how a tick can best be iden-
tified, and the champion tick-identifier may yet
dispute precedence with the champion milker.
And we have settled for good that problem which
recently arose in The Bulletin : “ The Devil, is
he a Cow ? ” He isn’t. He s a tick.

As a transport animal the horse is rapidly
disappearing from the Outback roads in \NhA.
Donkeys, camels and mules fill his place. The
horse may be a shade faster than his rivals, but
the fact that chaff has to be carried for at least
six months in the year is greatly against him.
Donkeys and mules will eat anything but the man
who drives them, and camels do not even draw
the line there, as many a teamster has found to
Ins cost. Donkeys are increasing in favor ;
they are good honest toilers, and alwaj's run
in a 1110 b when turned out at night, which
is a great consideration when the job of
rounding them up again is considered.. There
is nothing more soothing to a weary night-
shift miner, who is trying to get to sleep,
than to have a mob of 25 donkeys, each
with a firebell on his neck and a voice
like Gabriel’s trombone, grazing around the
camp. A donkey team, instead of depreciat-
ing with age, increases in value on account
of the natural increase, which is considerable.
If a teamster loses a donkey or two in the
bush, he simply goes ahead and delivers his
load, and picks up the truants on the way
back empty; while a camel would have to be
looked for at once, on account of his homing
propensity; and, considering that most of
Westralia’s camels have been bred in South
Australia, this is a serious matter. Camels
are very tough and hardy, but they are such
dirty, stinking, vicious brutes that they find
little favor with teamsters, Afghans excepted.
Mules are strong, wiry beasts, but very
stubborn and vicious, and do not seem to be
greatly in demand. Taking everything into
consideration, the palm as a transport animal
roust be given to the humble animal with a
scanty tail at one end and a plentiful bray
at the other.

“Southern Cross” : Various writers have
given various infallible methods for telling way-
backs. I tried it on lots, and it didn’t come off.
However, one can tell a N.S. W. South Coaster by
the following method, and, to those who believe
in evolution, the fact is significant. The South
Coast-girls who milk 730 times a year B at regular
periods—the offspring of parents who have milked
730 times a year at regular periods—have got into
the habit of opening and shutting their hands at
cow time when away from the cow. For instance,
at any South Coast show or picnic, when several
lady members of milking families stay to see the
proceedings out, somewhere about 4 o’clock, even
though they may then be watching a trotting con-
test, their hands open and shut spasmodically. It
is a weird sight.
“ Malacoota ” : Poaching wattle bark is a
thriving industry in some parts of Victoria. The
Victorian Government, whose root idea of govern-
ing is to shut up everything from the land down,
so that nobody can get at anything till long after
everybody is dead—endeavors to preserve all the
. wattle bark it can. In this patriotic endeavor
it is no wise assisted by an acquisitive population
which goes out into the scrub at night, or when
the local Forestry officer is elsewhere, and strips
off and bags and hurriedly ships all the prohibited
bark it can. Either that, or it waits for the other
fellow to go out and strip the bark, and sneaks his
bags of poached tree-hide, and leaves him with
murder in his heart and no outlet for his feelings
except silent prayer.
“ Silas Snell ” :
Is there room for a
windy district
competition ? I
enter Highton,
near Geelong, a
high locality in
the centre of a
swept plain,
where the wind
leaps in from the
sea, and smites
the lowly settler
off his property
if he is not se-
curely anchored
to a pick. You
know an old
resident by the
fact that he
wears no rim to
his hat and
walks inclined
to win’ward at a
slant of about
30 degrees.
Whether the
wind has blown
the rim off his
hat, or whether
he removes the
rim to preserve
the hat, I know
not; but the other
day I saw three
milk dishes blown
out of a cart, and
bowled into the
setting sun, and
was satisfied
with the hint.
It is on this
cyclonic emin-
ence that Bent
pitched a batch of
closer settlers in £l5O
houses that are well worth
half the money. They are unlined houses, and the
green boards have shrunk, so that the walls are
like half-opened Venetian blinds, and when
the breeze is breeziest it blows all kitchen
furniture out of the parlor window. There is not
a tree in the country side, and firing has to be
carted miles ; but the settlers can’t afford to cart it,
so that doesn’t matter. When cold blows the
blast across the moor, and the settler is on the
point of perishing from meteorological inclemency,
he thinks of Tom Bent, and instantly generates
enough heat to grill things, if lie only had any-
thing to grill. Already four or five settlers have
been blown off the higher points, and if you
imagine a Chinaman in his shirt clinging to the
topmost pinnacle of a polar berg in a tornado you
will have a fair idea of how the surviving settler
looks while endeavoring to remain directly con-
nected with his holding at Higliton, via Geelong.

“ Harrison 0.” also moans
In Bulletin (13/5/’O9) “Merino” moaned some (“My
Moan,” p. 44) re the utter monotony of bush life. But
city existence Is every bit as awful.
I make up my mind to awake at 7.30, and arise at 7.40.
I awake at the right time, go to sleep again at 7.34, and
finally arise at 8.5. I rush down to breakfast and
encounter the same old bacon and eggs. I never fail to
miss the first train, and I relapse into the second in a
disorganised state. It is the same old train. I always
meet the same people. There is a youth who suffers from
pimples, and betrays an eternal anxiety to obtain an
opinion as to “ Sowth’s ” chances. Then there is a man
with a drooping grey moustache, who daily states, with
the persistence of a great drip on a wet day, that “ All
this damned Socialistic legislation is driving Capital out
of the country.” And there is another—-a youth in a
bank. He sits opposite me in the carriage—and hi? neck-
ties worry me. X have an idea that the young man is a

CHEEKY BOY : “ That's a question that’s been
perplexing me for some time."
ecret agent of the Black Hand or some such society-•
perhaps the Bruce Smith League of Empire.
After alighting at the same old station, I do the same
old undignified sprint for the office. There, the same
old boss meets me, watch in hand. I tell the same old
lie.' He observes the same old “Humph!” I get out
t,h“ books and mutter the same old “ Damn.” At 1 o’clock
I make a bee-line for the same old hash house, and see
the same old fly on the ceiling. , . ,
At 5.45 I again board Tait’s train. The pimple-faced
youth is there, the grey-moustached tragedy is there, the
mysterious necktie is there, and they all intone the same
old platitudes with the same old air of unlimited wisdom.
After tea I read the same old Bulletin, and say that it
is not. as religious as it ought to be. Then I pick up the
Right-Thinking Argus to find out how Capital is faring
mad rush for the sen, and how goes it with Anti-
Sosh, and I learn that the Marriage Tie is still in dagger
of mutilation ; also that I am the only person in the
Commonwealth who is not yearning to present Bull with
a Dreadnought; and furthermore and moreover, that,
Mrs. Blank, Mathura-road, Toorak, wants a married
couple “without encumbrances.” It is all so deadly
monotonous! If Tkk Bulletin would only print some
“ Talks to Women,” or “ Nature Notes and Queries, or
“ Sunday Corner” ; or the Argus come out with a draw-
ing bv Norman Lindsay, and some verse by W. M.
Whitney and “ Kodak,” life would be worth living. At
10 30 I wind up the cat and put the clock outside the
same old back door, and propel myself to the same old
And next day, and all the rest of the next days, I
do the same old things over again.
BEYOND THE BANGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[f you had tramped for a thousand miles
Out over the purple range,
A thousand miles from the city’s change
And the pandering huckster’s wiles;
Aye, far remote from the sneers or smiles,
In quest of the lone and strange—
If you had tramped for a thousand miles
Out over the purple range.
If you had slept on the desert sand,
By the dusty tracks with me,
When you shed your burden wearily
In the midst of a lonely land,
Perchance at last you would understand,
Aye, you by the crooning sea—
If you had slept on the desert sand,
By the dim, dim tracks with me.
If you had starved in the Far Beyond,
And thirsted between the Tanks,
Day-dreaming the while of cool green banks
That circled a deep dark pond,
Reflecting for e’er each cloud and frond
And the birds that trill their thanks—
If you had starved in the Far Beyond,
And thirsted between the Tanks.
If you had trudged from the first dawn ray
Till the shadows blurred at night,
And the constellations, pure and bright,
Enshrined in the Shimmering Way,
Looked down on the aching tracks of day
And bathed them with holy light—
If you had trudged from the first dawn ray
Till the shadows blurred at night.
[f you had travelled the Loneliness
Out there on the Camel Pad,
Where the burning plains are Salt-bush clad
And the smothering winds obsess
When the weary wanderers onward press
(For he who bides goes mad)—
If you had travelled the Loneliness
Out there on the Camel Pad.
if you had slept on the desert sand
To the west of the purple range,
A thousand miles from the city’s change
In the midst of a brooding land,
Maybe at last you would understand
The Quest of the Lone and Strange -
If you had slept on the desert sand
Out over the purple range.

“XXX”: Head with profound interest
the stories of “No. 3” and “D.N.W.” re the
giant and racing pumpkins, and can say that both
yarns are perfectly true. In certain soils,
generally red loam, the pumpkin is a wonder for
size and speed. Down at Grabben Gullen, where
the big pumpkins and potatoes grow, the pump-
kins have to be yarded every evening just the
same as the cows. In some places both cow boys
and pumpkin boys are kept. It is always an
exciting tiling to see the pumpkin boy chasing his
charges back to their paddock, and the way they
take the fences at full gallop is most sensational.
Some of the station hands used to bet on these
pumpkin races. A greenish-brown vegetable won
three races in succession, but broke its back at the
rabbit-proof fence on the fourth occasion. About ,
the aforesaid district some pumpkins have run
wild, and threaten to become a greater pest
than the fox or rabbit. The farmers are now
seriously considering whether they will hold
monthly drives for the purpose of shooting the
troublesome vegetables. Some of the wild pump-
kins stand over six feet in their stockings.

“ Kola ” : There has been so much written
about the Australian and his alleged “tired feel-
ing” that I want to place on record a bit of evi-
dence on the other side. A few days ago I was
staying at an accommodation house in the centre
of the Vic. western, plains. The first night, just
at nine, a man arrived on a bicycle for tea. He
was wet all over except his shoulders, which were
protected by a cape. He had ridden since mid-
day, and had had nothing to eat since breakfast;
and he carried two heavy quart bottles. His trip
was mainly over bad roads, and he had waded
through two flooded creeks, one of which nearly
washed him away. But
he got up before day-
light next morning, got
into his wet togs again,
and set off on a 60-
miles’ ride in the teeth
of a driving winter’s
gale. And he didn’t
make any fuss about
it. Also, the miracu-
lous part of it is that
he was a Government
employee on Govern-
ment business. Next
night, at ten to nine,
a farmer arrived* also
very wet and cold. He
had been travelling
with a team to take up
wheat land. After tea
he yarned with me till
11, and then went to
bed, leaving orders to
be called at five. He
was called, and went
out into the black rain
to get his team fed.
Then, without break-
fast, he left on a 24-
miles’ trudge before he
would get dinner. And
he didn’t make a song
about it. The third
arrival, on a Saturday
night, just after 12,
was a parson, fleeing
along on a bicycle from
Ballarat, 50 miles away.
He was wet and hungry.
His bike had punctured
seven miles out, and he
had had to walk in the
rain. The parson preached
three times next day, and went to
bed at 9.30 p.m., leaving’ the landlady
sitting up to call him at 1.30 the same night.
She did so; and the parson plugged off on his
bike to catch the Adelaide-Melbourne express at
Ballarat. It appears he had a class to teach at
Melbourne. The parson, also, didn’t appear to
see anything extraordinary in his energy. All
three were young Australians, and they made me
feel very tired and lazy, but at the same time
rather proud of my countrymen.
“Clay-Pan”: Skirmishing round the
western side of Bourke recently, I was struck
with the spectacle of a quantity of tins
lying piled up against the fence of the show
ground. There were thousands of all kinds
and shapes. On inquiry I learned that the
garbage heap is about two miles distant, and this
pile had accumulated against the said fence by
being blown before the wind that Comes out of
the west and breathes hard on a partly-deserted,
but very interesting town. I estimate the weight
of these tins at several hundred tons, and I sup-
pose they would fetch some considerable beer-
money if melted down. Abdul Wade has removed
his camel station from the vicinity, but the smell
still hangs around. The train-of-the-desert proved
very profitable to Abdul, and he has invested the
money he made out of his portable stench in a
large sheep station.
“ Gip ” gives her view of the case :
“Louis M.” says (B. 29/7/’O9) that the good bushman
isn’t intelligent. Now, if he had said intellectual I’d have
agreed with him. I only know one intellectual bushman,
and he certainly isn’t a good bushman. Also he is
educating me over the fence. He has expressed the view
—not to me ; he’s far too polite for that—that, although
I have a certain superficial smattering of “ learnin’,” my
education with regard to the classics has been woefully
neglected. So he’s educating me in my advancing years,
and half an hour of his brilliancy fags me awfully. He
speaks great mouthfuls of the dead poets, haltingly, and
with many corrections and always over the fence. Even
when he assured me that his tradition of Shakspeare
was a terrible good one I bore it bravely.
But the intelligent bushman ! Why, he’s everywhere.
And surely no man was ever more astonishingly observant.
A station homestead here—a good old solid building that
has withstood the gales for 40 years and is still going
strong—was built by two bushmen who drove and rode
and cut the sheep’s hair for their living-. They had nevi r
received a lesson in building or carpentering in their
lives, but they worried along successfully. Two other
bushmen in this part—father and son, the one a boundary-
rider, the other drover, shearer and all-round capable
man—build waggonettes (all but the wheels), mend
clocks, and make furniture fit to place in any modest
home. They do this in their spare time. And they are
entirely self-taught. The elder man in his lonely boyhood,
shepherding on Monaro bush, even taught himself to
knit stockings.
In another bush family—-planted som what nearer
civilisation certainly—the sons are all smart blacksmiths.
Just picked it up. These subscribe to the Scientific
American, and have fixed up all sorts of ingenious labor-
saving- contrivances for their admiring mother. She's
might!' proud of those big, clever, uneducated, fine-
n itured hush boys of hers, with nary a vice amongst
them. Should any machinery go wrong in the district,
one of the three eldest boys is sent for by the man who is
in trouble. The machinery is invariably repaired to his
satisfaction, and work resumed. The fourth boy started
a little tomato-canning industry in his spare time, and
grows increasingly successful. They were all “ edu-
cated” at a half-time bush school, and have never visited
a city. And in the saddle, as bushmen pure and simple,
they are unbeatable. But this par. grows too lengthy.
The bushman who can, on an emergency, build a house,
run a sawmill or an engine for machine-shearing, shoe a
horse, do—oh, simply anything intelligently, and still
remain a fine and keen bushman, is too numerous to
mention.

“ Malacoota ” : The Australian bard has
found some national subjects outside the curlew,
the brumby and the hole in his pants ; but he has
painfully neglected two things that enter into the
daily life and vital being of this Commonwealth—
the cornsack and the kerosene-tin. The cornsack
is meant for epic, and the kerosene-tin for lyric
poetry. Why not ? Think of all the empty
kerosene tin stands for in the bush ! Chimneys,
buckets, cooking utensils, wash ewers, flower-pots
—what noble utilities and aesthetic yearnings it
fills, that shining link between our Socialistic
community and the Standard Oil Trust. No
wonder the proposed tariff on kerosene was vetoed
on the voices in the Australian Parliament. Then
the cornsack—saddle-cloths for the men from
Snowy River, bunks for Mitchell and his mates,
humpies for Sandy on his New Selection, aprons
for mother, a bed-quilt for baby, an oilskin in wet
weather for dad—there is no end to the reign of
bag in the bush. If Rod Quinn, for instance,
would only adapt his “ Stars in the Sea ” to
“ Slits in the Bag,” his name would be reverenced
beside every circling hearth in Australia.
THE KANGAROO SPEAKS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You have seized my lands, and driven me back, and
harried me off the runs —
Gins and snares and wallaby-traps, poison and dog's and
guns;
Barb-wire fences across the world that ever was free and
wide —
For once I could leap from the Gippsland hills to the
scarps of the Great Divide 1
Under the heights and over the hills I thudded my way
of old,
Till the slopes were studded with miners’tents, and earth
was warrened for gold ;
Down by the flats and round by the lakes in the belts of
timber I lay ;
But half the trees of the world are dead, and the coverts
are swept away.
ltoads of stone, and iron roads where the monsters puff
and blow,
Fire and ploughshares in the land, and the foot of a ruth-
less foe ;
And never a respite from the dread, and never a place
for me
Betwixt the devils that tear the earth and the devils that
rake the sea.
Yet I come of a line that was here of right ere ever your
race began ;
My tenure dates from a day remote from the rank new
weed of man ;
When the old macropus reared his bulk and lumbered in
jungle growth,
Scorning the puny wild dogs’ fangs and the edentata’s
sloth.
But now is the world bound down, and hemmed, and shut
from shore to shore ;
The hills are fenced, and the flats are hedged, and the
wastes are wastes no more ;
The smitten trees do not shelter me, nor the fire-swept
coverts hide,
Who once could leap from the Gippsland hills to the
scarps of the Great Divide 1

FEDERAL ITEMS AND SUNDRIES.


The undertakery men of Sydney spoke a. little
recently before the Wages Board. . They are
a badly paid lot, and their hoprs are long and
uncertain, and they have to associate
svi{h a very depressed crowd
of people.
The only cheerful person they meet
Is the heir, and he pretends to be
bathed in woe.
They are out In all weathers,
and, owing to the solemn
Satpre of their calling, they
are not allowed to Jump In
order to restore the circulation.
f J They are a
fifth!n spare race „
reason of
' long hours, bad /
•pay, and a large ab-
lattice of the habit of handing out solid
J Refreshment In the places they g
Ttlso. they are kw-ablding people, and the cases
,®£; 1 has been phlied up for
exceeding ifad speed limit or
for driving over a dog
are so tew as ndt
to be worth
mentioning^
By reason of their poverty they have
to buy their murky suits and plug hats
second-hand—which anybody might
reasonably guess by looking at the
goods, for the undertakery man’s black
raiment is always greenish or brownish
*»- when viewed sideways—and they are
» painfully aware that they may have
\ buried the previous owner of the
A clothes, and they don’t know what
he died of.
Undertakers are adepts
getting grease spots out of Vfe
clothes—they have to be by V 8
reason of having to preserve V 3
so much shabby gentility on so
very little pay. Some of them
repair their owrt boots.
It is alleged that
there Is no known
of an under-
taker having be-
come a great
admiral, or
the president of a republic, or
having conducted a success-
ful revolution, nor has one of
the tribe ever made a name
for himself by piracy on
high seas.
Profoundly peaceful men are
those who drive the brougham
of the dead, and they are
generally opposed to com-
pulsory military service;
they hear so much com-
pulsory burial service
that the very name of
“ service ” becomes
obnoxious-
* And they object
to war because' it
leads to hurried and im-
promptu burial, which is
bad for trade. Probably their
' chief value In a campaign would be as
■ scouts, for they are quiet-stepping
: people who could approach the enemy
unheard.
A large number of undertakery men go mad—possibly owing to the depressed
nature of their calling. There is no record of any one of them having gone crazy
on the box while driving the departed to his last resting place, and done anything
unseemly, such as galloping an Orange “stiff,” at 35 miles a minute, to the
Roman Catholic section of the cemetery; but still they are addicted to insanity.
An undertaker’s grave-side manner may be described as a physician’s bed-
side manner gone to seed. But, apart from all jests, the one time when the
rich, mean man tends to be liberal is when he Is burying his son or daughter.
He spends money freely on the hearse, the carriages, the burial plot, and the
great white slab. And It should strike him as Indecent and out of keeping that
the men who hump the coffin should be so poor, gaunt and hungry that they
wouldn’t care 2d. if everybody were dead.*

FAIR WOMEN’S FOE.
Fatness Easily Conquered.
The more beautiful a woman is the more dis-
tressing is it for her to discover that she is rapidly
getting too fat, and has not been able to find the
proper cure. Still worse is it when she impru-
dently tries fasting, exercising, tight-lacing and
so forth. Both health and good looks soon fly
away when such worse than useless methods are
employed. The beauty-destroying enemy can be
easily and harmlessly conquered by the most
inoffensive of weapons—cheaply, too, and without
the least bother. This is how : Go to your chemist,
and ask him for the following, and either let him
mix them for you or do so yourself One half-
ounce of Marmola, one ounce of fluid extract of
Glycyrrlnza 8.P., one ounce of pure Glycerine
8.P., and Peppermint Water to make six ounces
in all. The mixture must be taken in doses of two
teaspoonfuls after each repast and at bedtime.
Continue this simple treatment for a few weeks,
without even a pretence of starving or “ gytnnas-
ticating,” and you will soon recover your charms
of form, figure and feature. Don’t worry; tae
treatment will do the thing properly.*
PERSONAL
ITEMS
Speaker Holder left an estate sworn at
under £6200. His will was a simple document
made over 20 years back, when he was “of the
Burra, S.A., journalist.”
Oscar Wilde summed up George Meredith
as none of the post-mortem commentators have
succeeded in doing : “ His style is chaos illumined
by flashes of lightning.”
The luck of some men ! John Lawler,
who was on board the train which was wrecked
near Macalister (Q.) recently, and escaped with-
out a scratch, was in the Sunshine (Vie.) smash,
and had a similar let-off.
The deeply-seated conviction of the pro-
fession is that R. D. Meagher’s restoration to the
roll of ex officio gentlemen was due to Acting-
Chief Justice Simpson’s determination to have his
way. The three Judges in Meagher’s case were
not unanimous, and it was suggested that a Bench
of all the Judges should re-hear the application.
The Acting-Chief, remembering what happened
to W. P. Crick (his Honor stood alone for that
brilliant, ill-starred, lawyer-politician), would not
agree; and so Richard Denis got the majority
decision, and may now pursue Costs after having
been obliged to give the swift animal a rest for 14
years.
C. H. Bowker, a nonagenarian who quietly
stopped living at Camperdown (Vic.), the other
day, has a minor claim on the attention of the his-
torian. He came to Victoria in 1841, and asserted
that he not only possessed the first blacksmith’s
shop in Melbourne (at the corner of Collins and
Elizabeth streets), but also made the first buggy
for the first mayor of the new city. He must have
hurried up, for the first mayor started in 1542, and
he would naturally want his buggy and his new
dignity at the same time. But, on the other side
of the case, it is remarked that Melbourne was six
years old in 1841, and couldn’t have got along all
that time without a blacksmith, and that the
buggy was an unknown vehicle in Victoria till
1852."
J. B. O’ HA RA, Poet and Pedagogue, too.
A person named Willis is becoming the
most candid critic of the Government, which he is
supposed to support. If someone desires to know
where money for old-age pensions is to come from,
10 to 1 it’s Willis. If somebody snorts at the
appointment of the lamentable Foxton to the
Defence Conference, sure enough it’s Willis.
Indeed where criticism is called for, it is
nearly always Willis. The other times it is
Kelly, Bruce Smith, Johnson or ’Siah Symon.
The Fuse has quite a lot of hostile friends of the
most horribly amicable description.
“W.8.M.”: The astounding stamina of
light-limbed, but long-headed “ Billy ” Hughes is
a revelation of concentrated force. How does he
manage to keep fighting all the time in the
House, on the platform and in the press, besides
doing strenuous work for the unions and an odd
job now and then at his profession of the
law ? The secret is that he trains like a
gladiator, and exercises like a black-and-
blue artist. Tammy Burns never pre-
pares for pugilism more assiduously than
Billy Hughes girds himself for politics.
He punches the inflated rubber, casts
the caber and swings the dumb-bells.
He spins for a mile or two every morn-
ing. In the wilds at the back of North
Sydney, he cleaves the air with his
shaven chin, speeding along the level,
dipping the declivity and shinning up
the elevation with a pace that would
kill a fat man in 50yds. He races with
light and airy ease, chest thrown out,
arms worked scientifically, head erect;
and spindles flying. He could catch a
kangaroo or out-manoeuvre a hare. And
so Labor’s ex Attorney-General keeps in
fettle, ready to knock out Cook and bad
company, and make confusion worse con-
founded.
The biography of a Maoriland pressman :—■
Tom Morrison, who died at Napier (M.L.), the other
day, aged 65, was one of those who drifted from the case
to journalism and newspaper proprietorship. He went
to Maoriland from Ireland in his youth, did a little comp-
ing, and bought into the Hawke’s Bay Herald in the
’7o’s. In 1879 he sold his share to the late R. T. Walker,
a newspaper man who wanted a wider atmosphere than
Napier, for he was one of the best. Morrison took up
Parliamentary reporting for the Press Association, the
Hawke’s Bay Herald and some other Tory publica-
tions, and was for quite a lot of years chairman
of the Parliamentary Press Gallery. Though a staunch
Church of England man, a Conservative and a bowler,
he was nevertheless a real decent chap, and bore
a high reputation among members of the craft
in Maoriland. In his prime he was a first-rate reporter,
hut when he got to lobbying' and writing what he called
“ Wellington Gossip,” he was distinctly dull. But then
he was writing for dull papers. Every session, when
Tom got to Wellington, he would telegraph to his syn-
dicate: —“ I am told on what should be good authority
that the Financial Statement will be brought down on
Tuesday week. On the other hand, there are experienced
members who say Ministers are so behind with their
work that the Statement cannot be ready till Friday
week. On the whole, it may be Tuesday week
or Friday week, or even later.” Tom’s papers would
revel in this class of stuff, and put big headings on it.
And next night old Morrison would set the wires going
again ; “As I indicated yesterday, the Government is not
at all well advanced in its preparation of the Financial
Statement, and there are indications that two, or even
three, weeks may elapse before the Treasurer will be in a
position to place the condition of affairs before the
House.” Tom would keep on guessing like this, and one
night, when he was still speculating, down would come
the Statement, and take him by surprise. Morrison was
never married, except to the Tory party and the bowling
green and the church choir.
“ Oby ” writes :
The late R.O. Bishop Murray, of Maitland and New-
castle (N.S. VV.), spent his income as he went —unlike the
Anglican Bishop Tyrrell, who ruled over much the same
extent of territory. Bishop Tyrrell was personally ab-
stemious, but he was an enthusiastic investor, and he
gambled fiercely in station property and in flocks and
herds, not for his own profit but for the glory and en-
richment of the Church. He left £250,000 worth of land
and other assets when he died—that is to sav, he left
perhaps £500,000 worth of these things, with some
£250,000 of mortgages and liabilities on them ; so the
paper balance was a quarter of a million, even as the
paper balances of certain land banks were just before the
tower of Siloam dropped on the boom and broke its back.
Then came slumps, droughts, floods, low prices, high in-
terest, and all manner of devilments and Dead Sea fruit.
Bishop Pearson gathered in a little out of some coal-
mining' properties, and wrecked his mental health in the
struggle ; it was really a job for a hardened and battle-
scarred liquidator, not for a bishop. So, after all, Tyrrell’s
life of fiscal struggle panned out for not much more in the
end than Bishop Murray left behind him—which same
was about 7d.
“Jabez” (described in I. Chronicles 4,
ix., as “more honorable than his brethren”)
C. G. Wade, State Premier of N.S.W., is at least 27
times touchier than any previous holder of his billet.
In any given public matter, the question which appears
to stand paramount in his view is : “Did anyone con-
nected with the same ever, at any time, deliver himself
of anti-Wade sentiments?” If anyone did so, or lies
under reasonable suspicion of having done so, the matter
and all concerned therewith are turned down with great
velocity. For example, a deputation from the Clerks’
Union waited on Wahroonga’s hope and joy last
week to urge that clerking should be placed as an
industry on the schedule of the Industrial Disputes
Act. Wade at once said, heatedly, that he had been
“ accused by Mr. Mercer ” (secretary of the Clerks’ Union)
of soiriething or other ; and he made the circumstance a
text for many a wild outcry concerning the inherent
wickedness of Mercer—though even if this contumacious
person had spoken evilly of Wade in his political capa-
city, still the fact that he did his share in the work of
paying Wade’s salary might be regarded as a set-off.
And it was just the same in the Wise row—where, as a
punishment for commenting on Wade as a politician,
Wise had his Crown briefs torn from his amazed grip.
This sort of thing doesn’t make for freedom of speech,
which is a bad example for a “Liberal” Premier to set.
And it suggests, furthermore, that Wade is an even more
unimaginative character than he looks.
“D.” re knighthoods :
Alexander McA thur, erstwhile chairman of W. and A,
McArthur, Ltd., who died, setat 95, near London, last:
week, was a prominent enough figure in British polities
in his day to be able to side-step a knighthood. Certain
parliamentarians in the Odd Land are always liable,
unless they are both watchful and influential, to have the
shame of a knighting spilled upon them. For a quarter
of a century the McArthurs had sat, father and son, in the
House of Commons, and the efforts of party leaders to
induce one or other of them to become a knight
grew wearisome. At Inst a bright thought struck the old
man. “ Let us,” he said, “ steer the wretched thing' in
the direction of McMillan.” And the family arose im-
mediately, cheered thrice, and did as he had suggested.
And thereafter there was peace. Each of the great
political parties in the Cold Land has a certain number
of knighthoods to get rid of from time to time. The task
is one that calls for all that a parliamentary diplomatist
may have of adroitness and tact. It is recorded that the
Irish party caused a knighthood to be inflicted on a warm
adherent in Co. Kerry on one occasion, to which the latter
submitted, being at the time in drink. The party had
acted in all good faith, and yet when the mists of alcohol
faded from the newly-ennobled one’s brain, so that he
was able to grasp what had happened to him, he went
outside, stunned the secretary of the local Nationalist
League with a blackthorn, and severed his connection
with the cause for life.
The “ Oldest Inhabitant” speaks :
Alexander McArthur, who died in England recently at
the a ire of 95, came to Sydney as far back as 1841, and,
after looking round, started a drapery in Pitt-street, mid-
way, on the east side, between Market and King- streets.
He had a partner named Atkinson. Later on, one Little
was taken into the co. In the mid ’fifties the retail busi-
ness was given up, and Mr. McArthur began to drape in a
wholesale way in York-street, where the fluff business is
still carried on. McArthur was a meiuber of the N.S.W.
Assembly of 1859 ; lie represented Newtown. In 1861 he
was appointed to the Legislative Council. He returned
to England in 1863, and sat for Leicester in the Commons
from 1874 to 1892. He married in 1853, in Sydney, Miss
Maria Bowden Boyce, daughter of Rev. W. B. Boyce, of
the Glebe. The deceased was son of a VjTsleyan minister
at Londonderry and uncle of the disastrous William
McMillan.
The year 1850 provided S. Australia’s
heaviest crop of politicians. It produced Holder
(just dead), Kingston (died last year), Gordon (now
a judge), and Cock-
General, and now
burn (since Agent-
livingin England). All
four sat as colleagues in
the Kingston-Holder
Ministry of S.A.
which lasted from
1893 to 1899.
FASHIONS, Ac.
Saturday’s football riot was the subject of a question
put to the Chief Secretary in the Legislative Assembly...
“ Will the Minister,” asked Mr. Fitzpatrick, “see that
in future, so far as umpires are concerned, they are pro-
vided with protection in the shape of a coat of mail?”

Tasmania’s remarkable ex-minister, Cap-
tain Miles, who is supposed to have made a pot of
money out of Tongkah tin shares, has transferred
himself to Victoria, having bought Wonga Park,
the estate in the hills to the north of Ringwood,
once the property of the late Godfrey Downes
Carter, who was an amazing Treasurer under
James Beef Patterson. After Carter’s death the
usual bank passed it on to one of Tyson’s relatives
and legatees. He sold to one Robinson, who sold
to Colin Campbell, who married a young wife
and took her to Scotland. The Wonga Park
homestead is a 16-roomed mansion standing on a
hill, whence gorgeous views are to be had, and
from which Miles will be able to view the bull
and the bear while those furious animals are still
afar off.
Died at Tunbridge Wells, England, on
August 1, Sarah, widow of Francis Villeneuve
Smith, who was admitted to the Tasmanian Bar
in 1844, was Solicitor-General in 1848, Attorney-
General in 1854, Executive Councillor in 1855,
Premier in 1857, Judge of the Supreme Court in
1860 —he appointed himself—and Chief Justice
from 1870 to 1885. He was the only Smith who
attained a Premiership in this country, though
eight other Smiths—Bruce and Pumpkin (N.S'. W.),
Edwin Thomas (S.A.), George Patou, George
Verney, John Thomas, William Collard and L. L.
(Victoria) attained to Ministerial office. Twice
(under Parkes in N.S.W. and McCulloch in
Victoria) there have been two Smiths in one
Cabinet.
“ F.C. ” writes :
Victoria is spreading itself over two home-grown
heroes, miner Joseph Davis and Mrs. Lavinia Kennedy,
who lately risked their own lives to save those of others.
It would be bad if a country didn’t recognise this sort of
conduct; but, after all, we can spread the butter on so
thick that we haven’t any left for the hundred other
cases of real grit that we could see all around us if
we looked. For there are other heroes besides the
man or woman who, on the spur of the moment,
dashes in front of a train and grabs a child from death,
or who descends a shaft and pulls a fallen mate away
from an exploding charge. I know a printer who, finding
his eyesight failing, gathered up the few pounds he had,
along with his wife and five babies, and got on to a little
block of land near Melbourne, to make a fight of it. His
wife died, his eldest child followed ; he knew nothing of
agriculture to start with ; but for ten long years he has
battled hard and harder as his sight grew dimmer, and
now he begins to feel his feet. He has had no help from
State or public, and but little from his children ; but he
has kept on smiling. I know a woman, left a widow with
£4O and five children ranging from one to 11 years. She
asked no help from her relations, all living near, neither
did she put her younger children “on the State ” ; but
for many years she toiled early and late, “finishing
moles ” and keeping a little shop till the elder babies
could lend a hand. And everybody else who looks around
knows such cases. Pat miner Davis on the back, and
give Mrs. Kennedy a cheer by all means ; but let’s keep
the other gritty heroes in view, and save ourselves from
cant and hysteria.
N. J. Hone, who for years was a leader-
writer for the Register, died in Adelaide the
other day. In early times almost the only path
to the editorial staff was through a pulpit; and
Hone, who was a fine scholar, had that qualifica-
tion. But, in his case, the press was only a half-
way house on the way to commerce; and in his
latter days he pursued the shekels in an Adelaide
warehouse.
Unwanted s;ifts go elsewhere than to the
Cold Land navy, seemingly. The following is
from London Daily Mail (28/6/’O9): —
The Pope inspected his new motor-car, presented to
him bv American Catholics, in the Vatican gardens this
morning. Asked when he would take his first ride in it,
his Holiness replied, “Never.”
The Pope has been inveighing for months against
the Roman Cardinals’ growing affection for
motor-cars. Also, it is a condition of his job that
he shall not leave the. Vatican grounds, wherefore
a gift-motor appeals about as much to him as a
gift-Dreadnought might. And a Dreadnought
would be about the last thing one would offer to a
Pope, seeing that Holy Church lost its water
frontage some 38 years ago.
Mr. John Lionel Fegan is mentioned as a
returning man in politics. He has re-commenced
the profuse salutation of persons he chances to
meet, and his smile, though somewhat corrugated,
improves day by day. Fegan began hisN.S. W.
career with some political aptitudes, but he under-
valued consistency. Like Joe Cook, he entered
Parliament as a Labor.ite ; like Joe again, he
’verted to Reidism. But, unlike Joe, he next
’verted to Bill Lyneism, and after that came
slump. Joe Cook was astute enough to know
how far he could go with a whole skin; Fegan
wasn’t. However, he continued like Joe in one
respect—he preached fervently on Sundays and
any other time he could get people to listen. If
Fegan returns to Parliament, some newspaper
without fear of the Lottery Act in its heart, should
offer a prize for the best guess as to how long it
will be before he gets office.
The k ‘ Oldest Inhabitant ” is reminded of

Mrs. William Gfisdale, who died at Newcastle (N.S.W.) on
Friday last, aged 71 years, was the widow of the man who
gave the police the information vvhich led to the arrest of
Nichols and Lester for the Parramatta River murders in
1872. At that time William Grisdale was in partnership
with one Lister, as auctioneers in Pitt-strecc, Sydney,
about where the Imperial Arcade now is. The trade of
the firm was mainly in selling second-hand goods. To the
saleroom came a man with a bag full of clothing, evidently
belonging to a seafaring person. When Bridger’s body
was found floating—lie had been a steward on a warship
—in the Parramatia River, Mr. Grisdale remembered the
seaman’s kit he had for sale and informed the police. Detec-
tive Elliott waited at the saleroom until the alleged owner.
came to claim the proceeds of the sale. He turned out to
be George Robert Nichols. Detective Camphin (stillliving)
about the same time got information from a watchmaker
named Moss, in the Haymarket, concerning a watch which
proved to be the property of a second murdered man. This
led to the capture of Lester, alias Froude. The Nosey

was opened on Saturday, which strike a chord of human

THE KING ON TOAST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Governor T. G. Carmike has been telling a band of
prosperous commercial persons in Melbourne that they
are ever so much more loyal than a similar collection of
specimens in London. His Ex. said that ’Enery Weedon,
the first Victorian he met in London, told him he (’Enery)
was “amazed at the very calm way in which the King’s
health was drunk in London, compared with the loyal
manner in which it was honored in Melbourne.”
The Weedon man felt sore amaze
At J. Bull’s disrespectful ways,
Who, drinking whisky to the King,
Did neither bellow, dance, nor sing,
Nor, by a loyal frenzy led,
Stand for a while upon his head.
How different in Melbourne, where
“ The Toast. ” precipitates a stir,
From which no doting loyalist
For Death or Devil will desist,
While he has breath to scream a word,
Or make his frantic bellow heard.
The cock that crows like Gabriel's horn
Is said to greet the radiant morn.
4n fact, he flutters on the shelf,
And whoops to advertise himself.
“ The sun is up at last,” says he ;
“ Here is your chance to look at me !”

First Snow and Ice Carnival.
TIIK first annual ski and skating Carnival of tiie Kos-
ciusko Alpine Club was the event of the week at the
Hotel Kosciusko, the Government Hostelry on the slopes
of Australia’s h' ary highest uxunta n. The Hotel was
filled with guests of fashion from ail parts of Australia)
and the skiers ineb'ded one or two expert mountain
fliers from Switzerland who are globe-trotting, and whose
performances against the local champions excited a good
deal of interest. Charles Heidseiek and other recent
European visitors have commented on the extraordinary
facility whicn Australians display in sport that is new to
them, instancing particularly ice-skating. Ski-running
promises to provide another field in which Australians
may display their remarkable adaptability, and the pre-
diction of .vlr Percy Hunter in his lecture last week that
in a year or two we will be seining a team of Australian
ski-runners to wrest the world’s championship honours
from Norway seems by no means.far-fetched- The sport
on the snow and ice at the Hotel Kosciusko is glorious,
the air is wonderfully revivifying, and the temperatures,
though low, are not biting, the general atmosphere
being midsummer compared with the bleak wintry
blasts encountered in Collins-street, Melbourne, early
last week.
This is the opportunity for Australians to obtain a
change to the real winter, and at the same time to catch
a glimpse of sports which have hitherto been exotic to
our sunny clime. The difficulty which existed of pro-
viding accommodation »t the Hotel Kosciusko has been
overcome, and visitors may now leave any night and by
next afternoon arrive at the house by which the giant
hills rear their minarets of snow, and sport on toboggans
or glide on polished steel over the glassy surface on the
frozen lake. The Government Tourist Bureau reports
that although phenomenal falls of snow have taken
place, the drifts in places being 20 to SO feet deep, the
road has been opened and the Hotel four-in-hand now
takes the visitors from the motor at The Creel and
drives them in comfort the remaining few miles over
the snow to the Hotel. Night Carnivals on the ice are
a feature of the sporting life at Kosciusko, the weather
being so delightful that parties are frequently seen
skating in evening dress without wraps. Flare-poles
light up the surface of the lake, making a ball of light
in the darkness of the night. The graceful evolutions
of the skaters in the circle of light, and their flitting
shadows on the shining surface make a novel ami
magnificent spectacle.

SCIENCE SPEAKS.
In the treatment of any wound or sore, you
must not disregard the facts revealed by
scientific investigation. To heal speedily and
permanently it is essential to cleanse the affected
tissues and remove any poisonous element that
may be present. The part must then be so
soothed and vitalised that Nature can restore it
at once.
To accomplish this result, an ointment must be
used which, in its action while allaying all
irritation, penetrates to the underlying tissues
and purifies thoroughly.
Chase’s Universal Ointment is recognised as
the most unfailing preparation for the treatment
of cuts, wounds, bruises, etc., and skin
diseases in cases of long standing.
This famous Ointment is now manufactured in
Australia, and will be sent post paid to any
address upon receipt of price—3/6.
Please note— Chase’s Universal Ointment is
always supplied in glass jars to avoid contact
with metal.

Neuralgia Caused
by Tbin Blood.
4
The Right Way to Cure the
Complaint*
♦
This Woman Cured by the Tonic
Treatment with Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills.
Most cases of neuralgia are caused by thin,
watery blood. It’s an old story now that neuralgic
sufferers tell of how the blood became thin and
poor, and the nervous trouble, neuralgia, followed.
The nerves get all their nourishment through
the blood, and as thin blood lacks nerve-building
material, the nerves become starved. Pain and
nervous breakdown result.
The first thing to do in curing neuralgia is to
tone the nerves. This can only be done through
the blood. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are a tonic
for the blood that supply it with the necessary
elements to nourish and tone up the nerves, and,
the cause being removed, Nature does the rest,
and the neuralgia is cured.
Here is a typical instance of how they cure.
“Soon after my arrival in Eaglehawk (near
Bendigo, Victoria) I was attacked with neuralgia,”
said Mrs. Catherine Makepeace, Kirkwood Street,
Eaglehawk, via Bendigo, Victoria. “ The pain
was more severe from the time I would get up in
the morning up to about mid-day. It was terrible
in the right side of my face and head. It used to
come in gusts at times and nearly drive me mad.
I could not accurately describe the terrible agony
I suffered. I could not eat, as the pain used to be
so agonising with the least movement of the jaws.
At last I decided to give Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
a trial, for they had cured me previously of a bad
attack of rheumatism. My husband got some
from Messrs. Lay and Sons, chemists, in Eagle-
hawk. Almost from the first dose I found relief.
I continued their use until I felt quite cured. I
have never had any return of the complaint since,
and I always keep a supply in my house in case of
emergency. To Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, and
nothing else, do I ascribe my cure and present
state of good health. I should have said that I
was unable to attend to my household duties
during my illness, and my husband and children
had to look after themselves till Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills cured me.”
The price is 2s. 9d. per box, six boxes 15s. 3d.,
and if you have trouble in getting them send a
postal note for the amount to the Dr. Williams’
Medicine Co. of Australasia Ltd., Sydney, and
they will be sent post free by return mail.*

POLTICAL
POINTS
As the climax of a giddy row in the
Queensland Assembly, one recent night, politician
Woods was suspended till 7 p.m. And then this
fearsome thing happened :
Mr. Woods : “ All right, Mr. Speaker. I leave until
7 p.m., and I’ll deal with you then. Don’t you make any
mistake about it, OLD FELLOW ! I put you in Parlia-
ment, and I’ll put you out.”
And as the Speaker was too paralysed to assert
himself, the chances are he’ll be called “bloke”
next time.
In a N.S.W. Parliamentary paper printed
a few days ago ex-Premier Carruthers practically
admits the truth of what a daily paper corres-
pondent said some months back—that N. S.
Wales’ immigration officials in London only
accept married couples “ without encumbrance,”
and evidently do it under instructions. “ The
man with the young and helpless family is a con-
siderable embarrassment to the officials, ” says
Hector, late Joseph. The assisted immigration of
the “ married couple, without encumbrance,” may
suit the squatter all right; but for the country
which wants population there doesn’t seem to be
any immigrants who are less worth their passage
money —unless, of course, they are captured very
soon after marriage.
FAT, GLORIOUS FAT!
AMERICAN TOURISTS.
TO VISIT AUSTRALIA.—A PARTY OF “VERY
WEALTHY PEOPLE.”
Mother DAILY TELEGRAPH'S disinterested affection.
Victorian imports for the first six months
of this' year are almost all less than for the same
period of last year. Some of the items, however,
are not less enough, and call aloud for the Bill
to “ rectify anomalies in the tariff,” which Jocook
has sworn (allegedly) to help Deakin to pass.
Manure—mostly Japanese—has only dropped
from £62,160 to £60,927, which shows that the big
Melbourne factories, paying white men’s wages, are
not much more than holding their own against cheap
brown competition. Machines and machinery
show an increase from £247,110 to £288,317, largely
due to the Melbourne fat man’s craze for importing
everything he can. Agricultural, machinery,
which is kept separate, has increased from
£44,622 to £46,918, showing that the big foreign
trusts can still scramble over the Australian tariff
wall.
After agreeing to pay old age pensions to
naturalised Asiatics, the Senate thought better of
it and recommitted the Pensions Bill in order to
correct the mistake. The average ancient Chow
prefers to go back to the Flowery Land to die,
and it doesn’t seem advisable to pay him 10s. a
week to stay. It would be better to pay him ss.
a week to go away.
It appears to have gradually dawned on
Premier John Weary that when he sends the Vic-
torian police round the State next September to
collect names for the electoral rolls, immediately
after the same men have done the same job for the
Federal authorities, even the most bigoted State-
frighter will scoff at the senseless waste of coin ;
wherefore Mr. Weary is pondering deeply and at
length on a method of amalgamating the under-
takings and so saving some £15,000. It is an ex-
cellent thing to ponder over, as long as John
doesn’t ponder too long.
Labor member Anstey, of the State Parlia-
ment, is making an early start to capture Hume
Cook’s seat for Bourke (Vic.) in the House of
Reps. And it’s a good start as well as an early
one. He condemns the Dreadnought foolishness
and the threatened borrowing madness; and he
promises to battle strenuously for a graduated
land-tax. The “Liberals,” he remarks, admit
that Australia can only protect itself by getting
population ; yet the moment the Labor party
decided to take the definite step of making the
lands available through that tax, out it was
bumped.
Queensland and N. S. Wales have agreed
to stop the old cat-fight for the border wool-trade,
and there are to be no more differential rates on
the Queensland side. “This means,” according
to the official announcement, “that next season’s
wool from Moree and northwards will flow to
its natural outlet, the port of Sydney.” Apart
from the fact that, according to N. S. Wales’ own
railway map, Moree is nearer Brisbane than Syd-
ney, what has Newcastle done, anyway ? To get
from Moree to Sydney wool will have to be dragged
through Newcastle ; and though it was a shameful
thing for Brisbane to compete with Sydney
through a differential tariff, there isn’t a word
said about abolishing the equally disgraceful
tariff by which freight is encouraged to slide past
Newcastle and go an unnecessary 104 miles by rail
to Sydney—all to further bloat the capital at the
expense of the outports.
Premier Weary, of Victoria, and his Mines
Minister Mcßride have stepped into the wide
sloppy shoes of Bent, and gone land-jobbing, by
buying 319 acres at Powlett River for the new
coalfield township. Still, though the deal may be
unconstitutional, they have the excuse that they
bought a selector’s holding for £l5 an acre (he
paid the State 15s. per acre before the coal was
found), while, if they had waited for Parliamentary
sanction, other smarties would probably have
stepped in and reaped a profit of about £loo an
acre. The question now is: What are John
Weary and Mcßride going to do with the land ?
They sold it once before, or the State did ; and
when the public wanted it back, the public had
to pay 2000 per cent, advance. Which ought to
be a sufficient hint to John Weary not to sell the
land again, but to let it on lease, with periodical
revaluations.
Willie Kelly, of the House of Reps., is in
trouble. Apparently he won’t be seen in his
motor-car with the Fusees ; and when the censure
division was taken he was absent. He loftily
explained afterwards that he was much too busy
at the time packing his socks to attend to a mere
division involving the fate of a Government.
Then when the Speaker-election unpleasantness
was on, and the Fuse only saved its bacon by a
tie, Willie Kelly was again missing. This time
he gave no explanation ; evidently he had packed
all his socks. The Anti-Sosh press, which had
put William down as a certainty, is growing
uneasy, for the infection might spread ; so it is
demanding that he come to heel and be a good
tyke. Also Wilks says he is an Independent;
and Spruce Myth is heard complaining that the
Deakin defence policy, as expounded by Foxton,
isn’t the policy he subscribed to at the Fusion,
wherefore nobody need be surprised if he pre-
sently joins Senator ’Siah Symon in open re-
bellion.
“ Galleryite ”: The N.S.W. Labor party,
under the sleepy McGowen, is not the active body
that the Federal party is, and if Labor is to give
Anti-Sosh a run next State election it will have
to sparkle up. For instance, in the matter of the
Inebriates Bill it was rightly protested that the
recognition of private inebriate retreats, to which
patients could be consigned by friends and other
animals, was merely a return to the old private
lunatic asylum iniquity. Only 16 Laborists voted
on this important matter against 25 Government
supporters. A full Opposition would have carried
the point. Again, 23 turned up to vote for the
policeman’s Sunday off, and John Hop lost his
Day of Rest by a few votes. The best attendance
of the Labor Opposition this session was when the
Invalids Pension Bill was on. The party polled
29 votes out of their 32, and defeated the Govern-
ment on one important division.
“C.S.A.”: The other day some sugar-
growers on the Mulgrave (Cairns, N.Q.) got
almost as bad a shock as Johnson, M.H.R., did
when he sat down on a log and discovered that it
was a crocodile. Cutting time was coming on,
when the word was passed round, “Sixpence a
ton less this season.” “Not a penny of it,” said
the men, and they formed a strike camp, 200 or so
of them, while the growers talked in a loud voice
(intended to reach the camp) about sending south
for a big shipment of men. At which the camp
winked at itself and also began to talk in a loud
voice (intended to reach the growers) that if they
had to waste any more time squatting down
idle, they wouldn’t stir out to cut a
ton of cane except at an increase of sixpence per
ton. Evidently the growers who had put up the
job hadn’t thought of that, and the dread of having
to pay more when their hearts had been set on
paying less caused a rout. Now the leading
growers are busy telling everybody that they had
no sympathy with the reduction at all—it was the
other fellow. The other fellow says the same
with equal energy—and equal untruth, as a rule.
“ England has been true to commercial
freedom; her hands are unfettered,” says the
Argus. It may be so, but a nation that tries to
walk on its hands doesn’t, as a rule, travel fast
enough to keep in the van of the procession of
nations. And many a man whose hands are un-
fettered puts them freely into his pockets and
finds nothing there save a hole and a bit of fluff.
THE PROTECTIONIST WHIP CRACKS!
The Fused Ministry is Protectionist.— An early Deakin
announcement.
Bill Lyne launched a motion for a re-opening of the
tariff.— A more recent item.
THE OLD RING-MASTER: “ Whoa, there! Now I’ll
show ’em the difference! When th' boss has
seen this blamed old makeshift bring th’ whole
show into ridicule, I reckon he’ll take care to
engage th’ genuine article next time!”
Swinburne, the Melbourne gas-man whose
respectability drove him out of Bent’s Ministry,
is wriggling on the question of Wages Boards and
Arbitration. Swinburne opposed the re-enact-
ment of Wages Boards in 1902; but, in spite of
that, he last week was frightfully concerned lest
the proposed appeal to the Commonwealth Arbi-
tration Court should supersede the State Wages
Board’s decisions. In fact, Swinburne was so
keen on the maintenance of the Vic. Wages
Board system, which he had derided in 1902, that
he would apparently rather see his fellow Vic-
torian employer ruined by unfair competition than
have that system superseded by one applying to
all the States alike.
State frights turn up in all sorts of places.
The other day they invaded the Equity Court in
Sydney and demanded that a Melbourne trustee
co. should be removed because the estate which it
would have to administer is in N. S. Wales.
As a matter of fact it is close to Albury, and
therefore much nearer Melbourne than Sydney;
and most of the business of that part naturally
goes to the nearest capital. Further, as if to
knock out the only objection that might have been
taken, the Victorian co. is also formally registered
in N. S. Wales, so that it can be sued in the Ma
State. Nevertheless it was sought to set aside the
dead man’s wishes and knock the Victorian co.
out on the ground merely that its main camp was
on the other side of the Murray ; and though the,
Court finally swept State frights off the premises
it took about 23 lawyers to sufficiently argue the
matter.
“ Jacq” : The Victorian Parliament is at
last to be asked to instruct the Railways’ Stand-
ing Committee to report on a proposed line to the
Upper Murray—say from Wodonga to Corryong.
This district contains some of the richest patches
in the State, but, owing to difficulties of transit,
they are no good to the small man at present.
Here and there one sees great crops of wheat and
oats ; but it’s nearly all the big man’s wool that
crawls along the Murray road towards a market,
with an occasional mob of “fats,” Droughts
don’t worry the district to any great extent; the
worst affliction is the imported rabbit, fie is
more frequent here than in ahy other part of Vic-
toria, and a railway line would bring the army of
trappers who are so successfully thinning tlie
animal out down the country. Parliamentary
and newspaper men treat the back-country of
this part as useless land. True, it is rough and
thickly timbered ; but for men who do not mind
hard work there is no better country in Victoria
yet unopened.
The “ Old Soldier ” writes :
Tiib Bulletin (29/7/’O9) takes Cook’s arms factory a
great deal too seriously. Apart from the question of the
competence of Cook’s adviser, the contract will prove a
delusion. The plant is only to turn out 15,000 “ rifles ” a
year, meaning apparently without bayonets and other
accessories, which will supply just about 50 per cent,
more than the present demand for replacing worn-out
arms. The army rifle, with its hard bullet and rapidly
gaining twist, is worn out before it has fired 2000 rounds ;
or with the ordinary wear of practice in time of peace, it
will, with care, last four years. In war-time, after two
days’ hard fighting,- the rifles of all the men engaged
would be so worn that they would be practically unservice-
able. If Australia got universal service, and only 60,000
men were called out first year, it would need four years’
output of Cook’s factory to arm them, and each year more
recruits would be coming forward to be armed, but there
would be no arms for them. It would take 10 years’ out-
put to arm 150,000 men, without allowing for the new
rifles needed to replace the worn-out arms already in use.
The real question for consideration is not whether Pratt
and Whitney’s machinery is good of its kind and capable
of doing what its makers claim, but whether it can supply
the possible wants of Australia in war-time ? In fact, the
utmost it can do is to meet the present peace require-
ments with a small margin over, and, with the present
nominal land force of some 30,000, it could not supply the
waste of three months’ hard fighting. Cook should try
again ; his present attempt is likely to leave Australia
more helplessly in the lurch than before.
The insane policy of dragging everything;
to Sydney produces curious results. Practically
all the manufactures of the State are in Sydney,
because all the railways meet there ; therefore
every unemployed artisan makes for Sydney. If
he is stranded he is stranded in Sydney. Nearly
everybody who is shifting from one part of the
State to another in search of work, goes to
Sydney, for you can hardly travel
from any place in N.S.W. to any
other place 400 miles away without,
the railway carrying you round by
Sydney. If the shifter’s money runs
short on the way, he is probably
wrecked in Sydney. Everybody who
wants a Government billet makes
for Sydney, because everything is
there. Nearly everybody who wants
a clerk’s job, or a wharf-lumping
job, does the same, for almost all
the State’s commerce is there. As
one result of this policy, the Wade
Government is bringing out immi-
grants to fill the empty spaces of
N.S.W. and is at the same time pro-
viding sand-shifting jobs for the Syd-
ney unemployed. The struggle to
drag everybody to Sydney naturally
attracts to that city people who can’t
get away again for want of money.
Also it so establishes the habit of
going to Sydney that the unem-
ployed at last refuse to leave the-
place. Then city relief works of the-
sand-shifting variety follow. What else could be-
expected to follow ?
An interesting circular has just been issued
by the Rodney (Vic.) shire council, one of the
most Anti-Sosh bodies in the State. It invites-
other councils to consider its suggestions re a.
land-tax
(1) That there should be an exemption of at least £5000..
(2) The tax to be on the unimproved value, rising in.
reasonable gradations.
(3) That such tax should stand -for at least 10 years.
(4) That the revenue derivable therefrom should be set.
apart for State, as opposed to Commonwealth, purposes.
(5) That, concurrent with such taxation, there should
be a corresponding reduction of freights on all country
produce.
This shows how the current runs. The Anti-Sosh
crowd sees that a graduated land-tax is inevitable ;
so, before the party which really believes in the
tax is strong enough to carry it through in a proper
form, Rodney’s bright idea is to carry it through
in a more or less garbled form. Then no doubt it
reckons the real land-tax party will have the
wind taken out of its sails, on exactly the same
principle that the awful Victorian parody on a
land-tax has stood in the way of a genuine tax for
30 years.
The thirteenth raid.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
6’ne afternoon Iri gloomy June the rain had ceased to
souse,
Wh'eri Pankh'urst and her merry maids set out to storm
the House;
And Mr. Asquith sat within',- as hold as any mouse.
All good and true, the men in blue, a thousand three
times told,
Stood round and kept us moving on, for fear of catching
cold ;
What wonder the Prime Minister continued calm and
bold !
But Mrs. P., as bold as he, with seven ladies more,
Marched proudly through the Palace yard, right to the
Palace door.
“ I’ll see that man,” she said, “to-day, or welter in my
gore ! ”
Inspector Jarvis stood to bar the noble woman’s way ;
Said he, “ Ye cannot enter now ; this is His busy day,”
And Mrs. P. demanded “Why?” He sighed, “I cannot
say.”
He bade her stand. She raised her hand and smote him
on the cheek ;
Then someone said it was a shame to wallop one so weak,
And others took those ladies up to go before the beak.
Then one or two remarked, “ 800 ! hoo ! ” and three or
four hoorayed ;
Though wherefore so we may not know, nor why some
stood dismayed.
But each and every one agreed it was a mighty raid.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, August 9, 1909.
My Beak Artnt, — .
In that part of tlie Maoriland Gazette, deal-
ing with patents, there appeared recently the
distinguished name of Victoria Alexandrma
Muriel May Hamilton Temple Plunket, which is
the cognomen of her Excellency of M.L. lhe
lady with the long name has set a good example
by being the mother of many, and she also
spends much time in forming associations for the
protection and proper bringing up of little
strangers. The “ Plunket Nurse ” is well known
throughout M.L., such an individual being a dis-
trict nurse who gives her- services free to any
mother who wants to learn how to properlvifeed
and care for her offspring. It follows that her
Excellency’s invention has to do with new arrivals.
It is an improved shade for perambulators which
keeps out the sun and wind, but allows plenty of
fresh air to reach Baby junior.
I have great pleasure in acknowledging receipt
of £lO from Mrs. Nea Flemmich, of The Terraces,
Sydney, for that deserving charity, the Hospice
for the Dying. May the good deed be rewarded
one hundred fold.
Mr. 0. B. Martin goes to England to start
practise at the English Bar next month. His de-
parture will set free a certain amount of probate-
moving work, which will be a boon the
struggling junior practitioners of this State.
Arrived in London, Mr. Martin proposes to
specialise on the Parliamentary side, of which
jurisdiction it has been written that “the work
may be dull, but the fortunes reapable thereat are
absolutely dizzy.”
The Powerful left us last week and proceeded
'(Jyia, the Brisbane Jubilee celebrations) for the
Fiji Islands. It is understood that the Admiralty
felt that the young men in authority on this craft
needed a short rest-cure —hence the cruise. A
thoroughly sociable lot are the commissioned
officers of the Flagship, ever ready for any sort
of jaunt, party or other burst at which heiresses
are liable to be present. Very gratifying is the
marked interest taken by the overseas tar and
marine in the home-bred heiress. I inquired
once if there was any examination-subject such
as “ How Best to Keep the Eye Peeled for
Heiresses ” in the Navy course, but was assured
to the contrary. So the skill betrayed by our
periodical visitors in diagnosing and attending to
these rare and fair creatures is the more admirable.
I hear from a friend in London that Mr.
“Willie” Lawson has definitely thrown in his lot
with the Motherland, and intends to stand by her
to the last. The fact that his properties in this
Socialism-accursed country have been returning
particularly good dividends during the last three
years has enabled him to adopt this essentially
imperialistic attitude. He has a flat in the
most desirable section of the West End, a
motor-car capable of accommodating, if neces-
sary, from six to eight coryphees of normal
weight, and a moustache—all new acquisitions
since he left these shores. Curious the way things
work out. The more Socialism that descends
blight-like on this continent, and the more Pro-
tection that grips it, and the more Labor members
i ( t achieves, so much the more cash is it enabled to
send to its absentee capitalists in London. This
is against all the rules of the game as laid down
by the female anti-Socialist Conferences and the
young gentlemen who write their “papers” for
them. The matter calls for explanation.
“Are you a Mason?” was a needless query at
the annual Masonic whirl last week. Almost
every male wore a colored pinny of some sort,
together with sundry ornaments of a mystic kind,
about which women are so curious and get so little
satisfaction. Bugle calls and a clash of swords
kept time to a march, and the march heralded a
procession under the Arch of Steel—of Masons,
Mark Masons, Arch Chapters (nearly enough for
a volume), Masters (Right Worshipful, Grand and
otherwise). Then came a batch of Knights
Templar, who I suppose are something swagger
in Masonic society, in picturesque Middle-Aged
hooded cloaks of white. Each Knight Templar
had a large Maltese cross in red on the left
shoulder and another on the white “jumper”
worn underneath, and a red plush smoking
cap on his knightly and contemplative head.
Another bugle call, and M.R.W.G.M. Bro.
Montgomerie Hamilton came forth from under
the crossed swords ; so did sundry other Right
Worshipfuls and their worshipped other h dves,
visitors from adjoining States ; and bricklayers,
hod-carriers, mortar-mixers, steam-cranes, and the
yest of the rank and file of the Masonic biz. ;
then, finally, to the worn-out old tune, Right
Worshipful Brother Chelmsford and his consort
arrived to take up their seats in the enclosure. In
the middle.of the first set of lancers—during which
aide Verney stood out on the floor behind Ex.
Chelmsford, apparently to save him from violent
contact with the other 900—some of the decora-
tions up aloft caught fire and came to earth in the
midst of the dancers. Nothing serious happened.
“How to Dress Decently on £BOOO a year”
was the subject of a little speech by Mrs. Gould
during the hearing of the Gould divorce case, in
Yankeeland, a few weeks back. She pleaded
guilty to changing her gowns five and six times
daily. She had costumes for everything. While
at Palm Beach, probably' the most fashionable
ljesort in Fried Nigger Land, she always
wore three different gowns every day, and
never wore the same one twice. Upon returning
to New York these gowns were given away!
Mrs. Gould asserted that “the very mildest form
of dress” would cost her £BOOO a year ! “What
would happen if you wore one of those gowns
tjivice?” an inquisitive Judge queried. “It would
be very bad form — very bad,’’ was the reply.
Tin; mystery is how the now partially-divorced
indy managed to scrap along at all on such a
paltry allowance as £BOOO !
f Desertion is the plea in most divorce cases. It
is a simple way of doing the business, and it re-
quires no co-respondent, not very much evidence,
;pid a minimum of costs. There is only one shark
to pay 7, for the defendant doesn’t appear. There-
fore his side of the case isn’t presented to the
Court, and that deprives the story of much of its
interest. Sometimes he has a case and a good
excuse if it were worth his while to emerge from
his retirement and present them. I know of one
woman who got her decree recently, and my sym-
pathies are with the deserter. She was (and is)
the record clean woman of the globe. She can
smell a germ in the next terrace. She can
tolerate anything but dust, soil, taint, smudge,
blur, spoil, spot, speck or semblance of dust. Her
lawful owner dared not leave the house unless he
was spick and span and brushed. He had to
shave morning and evening, change his shirt and
collar twice a day, wash his face and hands at fre-
quent intervals, take a cold bath in the morning
and a hot bath at night, and overhaul himself
whenever he thought of himself—or herself.
Worst of all, coming home dead tired of an even-
ing, he had to wait outside his house until
she passed the brushes to him, and he dared not
enter even the back door until he had replaced his
boots with slippers. He was the most inspected
man in the Commonwealth, and he fled from an
affectionate wife because he could stand it rip
longer. I believe he went away to have a dust
bath, as a fowl does.
A curious affair of the heart is disclosed in the
Townsend case which has been occupying the
Court of Mr. Justice Sly for the past week. The
co-re. is 62. He claims cheerfully that most of
the things alleged against him are true. Accord-
ing to his version, he has been loving the
respondent in the case not wisely, but more or less
well, for 14 years. Incidentally he has been
married all that time. Furthermore he has also,
during the same lengthy period, supported
another lady and another establishment. At
intervals Mr. Townsend tried to horsewhip him.
It was his custom, on these occasions to
produce a cudgel from an inside coat pocket
and belabor the infuriated husband. He
has a depressing story about jewellery, furni-
ture and so forth which, he says, he advanced to
the Townsend lady ; also he seems to have been
occupied interminably “releasing” jewellery, pay-
ing off bills-of-sale, and performing other financial
operations on her behalf. Balzac drew just such
a character as Fisher represents himself to be—
one who was prepared to wade through seas of
assault and family trouble and expense for the
youthful object of his adoration. But Balzac’s
septuagenarian lover was a member of the idle old
aristocracy of France. The infatuated Fisher is a
humble cornmercial man—a type which is under-
stood to halt and ponder deeply before it
squanders a farthing of its hardly-won gold.
It is strange how rarely one encounters this
sort of real-life human in fiction. The elderly
male whom the novelist represents as depleting
his banking account at the call of love is nearly
always a marquis, or something of that sort. A
consideration of the evidence in the Townsend
case has gone far to convince me that even money-
lenders may have their romances. There is an
original story waiting to be written round the
manner in which Sol Isaacstein, after living pen-
uriously at Balmain on 30s. a week for upwards
of 25 years, suddenly saw, met and loved the
spouse of a Waverley plumber, and straightway
started to lavish on her the fruits of a lifetime’s
judgment summonses, so that he ended his days
as an old-age pensioner without an asset in the
world. No one would accept the study as true;
but that wouldn’t affect the sale of the volume. .
Mrs. George Cornwallis-West, who was Lady
Randolph Churchill and is the mother of Cabinet
Minister Winston Churchill, has bourgeoned forth
as a playwright. “ His Borrowed Flumes ”
is the name of her effort, and it is de-
scribed as “ a modern society play.” A
star cast, with Mrs. Pat Campbell, Gertrude
Kingston and Henry Ainley in it, was billed to
interpret the show at the beginning of last month.
The big “ Hicks Theatre ” in Shaftesbury Avenue
was mentioned as the venue, and H. W. Varna
(erstwhile well known in Australia with the
J. C. Williamson and Day-Flemming cos.) as the
producer. The first “house’’was sold from floor
to ceiling two weeks before the opening night,
King Edward and his spouse being among the
patrons. And yet the fair playwright has never
before written a line for boards purposes, and,
by all accounts, doesn’t know the rudiments of
the art at which the divine Bill excelled. In
London the play’s not necessarily the thing to
touch the pocket of the King, or other socially-
prominent person. It quite suffices, for a con-
siderable time, if the playwright is a well-known
inhabitant of Hebrett.
I am sorry the fire came and shut down the ex-
cellent show that was in progress at Her Majesty’s.
For one thing, there was the acting of Miss Grim-
ston. She portrayed the type which is describable
only by the over-worked word “lady,” and
actually succeeded in making the character in-
teresting without being grotesque. A notable
feat this. If I weren’t terrified of being unjustly
charged with a striving after paradox, I should
lay it down that any actress of intelligence can
play an emotional partin fairly convincing fashion,
but not one in a thousand can limn a woman of the
world as she really is, and make her other than a
dry, dead, deceased, defunct stick. There is no
emotional “fat” in the role of such a one, or if
there is it must be hidden away from the public
notice. Not for her the despairing heart-cry that
thrills the lachrymose gallery, or the grovellings
in the limelight with hair in effective disorder.
She never rescues people from violent death, or
expires picturesquely herself, or accomplishes any
ideally stirring deed whatever. She has, when in
the society of her kind, to be always neat, brushed-
up, calm, self-possessed, carefully modulated as to
voice, earnest to avoid over-emphasis, or she fails
to suggest the real thing. Miss Grimston was
all these drab things in “The Flag Lieutenant,”
and withal she managed to provide a picture of a
live vital woman. It was right good art, and I
should like to see her play Lady Cicely in “ Cap-
tain Brassbound’s Conversion.”
Australiennes are still coming to the front now
and then. The latest to put her foot on the first
rung of Fame’s ladder is Miss Clarice Sandford, a
Sydney art student who used to dab color on
canvas under the supervision of Julian Ashton and
Sid Long. Only a couple of weeks after her
arrival in the Hub she competed for and won a
12 months’ scholarship at the London Art School;
against nearly 100 competitors. George Lambert
(known to his pupils as “Lamby”) is one of
the instructors at the school; he comes
once a week and spends an hour or so
criticising the work. Miss Sandford resides at
Alexandra House, originated by Queen Alex-
andra, a sort of high-class pension, about
the size of our Equitable Building, where the
Queen strolls in occasionally to see how things are
getting on, sometimes exchanging ready cash for
the students’ work. The house is inhabited only
by girls, and includes on its register Fairlie
Cunningham, the young Sydneyite who is learning
to sculp ; likewise a Penfold girl from Bendigo,
who is musically inclined. All the residents study
something, music, art, the drama, and domestic
science. One of the girls came home very tired
one night, and announced that she had spent the
greater part of the day at her dramatic school
learning to fall in case she might have to die
suddenly or be shot on the boards. And the
practice wasn’t done on cushions either. She had
been falling for hours on a hard surface.
I see a “Poverty Point” scribe (5/8/’O9) men-
tions the rumor that J. Superbus Knignt em-
ploys his leisure knitting, and then casts doubt
on the allegation in the words, “but probably lie
doesn’t do it, after all.” I don’t see why he
shouldn’t. Also, I believe, he models in clay, and
carves wood, and designs female dresses, and is an
expert housekeeper, and knows a considerable deal
about cooking. *and in a thousand other ways
is far from being, in private life, the desperate
character he so often seems on the boards. There
is another side of the J. Knight personality
that has often been misrepresented. It is said
that the swarms of love-lorn damsels who pursue
him with declarations of passion, owing to the
turn of his calves, have resulted in the turning of
his head. In a word, he is charged with putting
on “wing” or side. And yet it is not so.
When he inhabited Tom Ewing’s house at
Mosman, a while back, the suburb was treated
to a sight that astonished it considerably. It
was a pouring wet night, and, even as the late
theatre-boat was in the act of unleashing
itself and starting Mosnianwards, Julius strode
aboard, gamp in hand. A score of luxuriously-
clad maidens sat up and took immediate notice.
They would- have adored to have had a word .with
their hero. However, his eye lighted on a
corner wherein crouched two who were palpably
of the domestic class. His face brightened.
He greeted the one, was presented to the other,
and engaged both in converse till the wharf of
their joint and several destinations loomed
through the downpour. Then a surprised body
of theatre-goers witnessed the impressive spec-
tacle of their Marcus Superbus of an hour or so
previously escorting underneath his rain-shield
(■I) his cook and (2) her lady-friend, the housemaid
of an adjacent mansion. Plaving dropped his
cook out of the wet at the Ewing house, Julius
walked her friend along to her edifice and then
strode home. No; there is certainly no offensive
hauteur about the J. Knight make-up.
The ex-students’ union of St. Vincent’s College
had its annual dance at Baumann’s last week, and
unionists and non-unionists' whiled away a few
hours in revel. During the evening Miss Kate
Rooney, in a frock of white and silver, “looked
in ” to renew acquaintance with some of her con-
temporary collegians, who agreed that “Kate
hadn’t changed a bit” since she last was in their
midst.
Under the direction of Mrs. Brandon Usher,
Miss Maud Grantham, in three “ chirps,” gave a
recital of “The Cricket on the Hearth” at St.
James’ Hall on Monday of last week. The story
was well told, and the characters of Dickens —
Peerybingle, Dot, Caleb and Bertha Plummer,
Tackleton and the mother of May Fielding—
seemed to move across the stage, so well were they
1 drawn. Miss Emma Sussmilch’s sweet voice was
heard in a couple of songs, which were encored ;
Mr. F. Richmond Crouch sang three new ballads
composed by Miss Grace Sherlock, who accom-
panied him ; and Miss Constance Brandon Usher
assisted with a couple of pianoforte solos.
Mrs. Christian, represented by Dame Manning
and the girls of the Garcia School of Music, held
a reception in the Y.M.C.A. Hall last week in
honor of ex-student Mrs. Kate Rooney Kirkham.
The recepted one was frocked in pale blue and
opalescent embroideries, and wore a handsome
necklet of Indian workmanship. Several hun-
dreds of well-known faces filled the hall, and
politics hobnobbed with music, and the Church
spoke familiarly with the Drama. Familiar faces
; in the gathering included Henry Stephen and his
wife, the Manning girls, High Court Justice
O Connor, ex-Premier Carruthers and Chief Rabbi
and Mrs. Cohen. A short vocal programme by
several of the Garcia girleens and a pianoforte
solo by Mdlle. Yvonne Leverrier preluded an
adjournment to a smaller hall, where supper was
served under the portraited eyes of leading
Y.M.C.A. lights, past and present.
With a huge audience and a background of
Garcia girls, Miss Kate Rooney made her re-
appearance in Sydney after an absence of 8h years.
She burst upon the public view garbed in
charmeuse the color of ripe corn, with a corsage
decoration of gold embroidery, and wearing the
handsome necklet that is seen in her latest picture
cards. Admiraless Poore and Premieress Wade
graced the square of blue carpet. Miss Rooney’s
first item was the great soliloquy from Saint-
Safen’s “ Samson and Delilah,” in which Delilah
prays that Samson may fall a victim to her
arts, and give her a chance to diminish his
thatch. This she sang with great insight
and notably clear enunciation, giving as encores
“My Ain Folk,” and Grimshaw’s quaint
“Songs My Mother Sang to Me” —a collec-
tion of old nursery rhymes linked together
with a refrain. A couple of songs from “ A Lover
in Damascus” were also included, and finally
“Abide With Me” (alias “Come and Live at Our
Place ”), with Mr. G. Faunee Allman at the organ.
In this item the songstress was heard at her very
best. Quite a procession of ushers marched to the
front with various offerings of garden produce, and
one wondered if there was anything left at the
florists for to-morrow. Supporting the star were
Mr. George Grimm, Mr. F. Mowat Carter, the
girls of the Garcia School in chorus ; an orchestra
of more girls and three men, to say nothing of a
small boy, very well conducted by Mr. W. J.
Grieves ; and ' Miss Ziliah Harrison, a bright
fresh-looking girl, who pleased most in “Cornin’
through the Rye ” and “ The Wren.” The inevit-
able and only Sykes was at the piano.
What is known as the “Glaciarium Case” is
set down for hearing at the beginning of next
month. The trouble arose out of the discovery
by a skater of a lady’s bangle on the ice. He
claims that, owing to his refusal to deliver the
gaud up to one whom he considered an unauthor-
ised person, the Glaci. authorities tore h;m
violently from the frozen surface whereon he was
innocently frollicking, and caused him to be
haled, like any malefactor, to a police station.
The disguised dukes and so forth who control the
destinies of the G-laciarium present the stony visage
of blank incomprehension to any efforts to draw
them on the subject ; yet, withal let it be under-
stood that they are prepared, if necessary, to
wager one or more of their ancestral halls that
their attitude in the matter has been misrepre-
sented. Society, or at any rate such of it as
frequents the Glaci., awaits the upshot of the dis-
turbance with apprehension. There is wild talk
afoot of calling all sorts of people as witnesses.
Can a barrister delve into one’s entire previous
life and habits apropos the question of whether or
not a complete stranger was dragged from one
spot to another ? This is the problem which is
agitating such of the nobility as saw the gallant
struggle put up against tremendous brawn by the
plaintiff in the coming action. If the answer is
in the affirmative, there is like to be an exodus to
foreign parts that will gladden the hearts of
steamship directors more than much strong drink.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.
“ Coda ” writes from Lawler’s (W.A.) :
I have had a bad attack of conscience lately, and, see-
ing- an item in your columns recently re conscience-
money, a brilliant idea has struck me. I will confess.
Listen 1 Once there was a man, and he had a friend who
was much addicted to practical joking. This friend once
played one of his jokes upon him, and he determined to
have revenge. Listen again ! He wrote a poem, in
which he perpetrated all The Bulletin’s pet aversions,
and signed the joker’s name to it. He rhymed “dawn”
with “ morn ” three times, and once rhymed “Australia ”
with “Australia,” which, as The Bulletin truly remarked,
was a good rhyme, though a trifle monotonous. He
also used four long words which looked magnifi-
cent, hut are not to be found in any diction-
ary. The sentiment was very distinctly Tory,
and the sense vague and obscure. As the last
straw, he put a penny stamp on to carry it from
Westralia, and enclosed an addressed envelope, with a
Westralian stamp affixed, for return if not accepted. As
anticipated, the poem received a warm welcome in The
Bulletin’s correspondence column, and, as all the joker’s
friends took The Bulletin, he got an exceedingly hot
time. The man was very pleased with the success of his
plot for a while ; but his conscience soon began to trouble
him. lAM THAT MAN. Before I wrote that, poem my con-
science was as good as new—in fact, it had never been
used ; but now ic is worn to rags. I assess the damage at
£l9 18s. 6d., and a cheque for that amount will oblige. I
know this is a departure from the general run of con-
soience-money letters, but the people who wrote the
others evidently had no sense, and didn’t reason the
matter out. It is mv conscience that got hurt, not yours,
and so it would be idiotic for me to pay you for damages.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, August 9, 1909.
My Dear Yarrie,—
The St. Xavierians pitched their ball with
much vigor in St. Kilda Town Hall last week.
The crowd belongs specially to Kew and Hawthorn,
but they grafted themselves on to the sea suburb
for the time. In the ballroom they “ set ted ”
in various colors, which were regulated
to sashes and crooks, and did not fly
to noses. The pinks and blues gallivanted
tamely later on among the common or garden
waltzers, but the green set shouted in Paddy
staccato from every corner of the ballroom. Mrs.
Tom Hogan was the cheeriest Irish colleen in this
set, while her husband tried to look happy with a
green sash across his manly starched che£t. Oiie
would imagine Xavier as the patron saint
of the Hebrews —99 per shent of the friskers
affected the Hebraic and generous mould of
olfactory organ, instead of the joyous tip-tilt
nationalised by the cheerful Celts. Even the
Paddy set —the emerald-green-cum-simple-mar-
guerite square—was organised by Mrs. Monty
Vienna Levy, and was augmented by the hand-
some Brasch brothers and their special choice in
girl- i
Miss Evans made a touch of picturesque color
among the conventionally frocked women.
Her green erSpe shawl clung over a black
and silver, and purple grapes hung in her Circe-
’ red hair. When the dusk of the dress was liafted
up for waltz-gliding there appeared purple skirts,
purple silk ankles and purple shoes. This warm-
haired maiden dances in a way no other ball-
■roomite can approach. Miss Kauffmann made a
'dream in frocking. Moonlight blue lit up the
color of blue eyes putin “wit th’ smutty finger,”
as the saying is. A sister banded brown on her
black hair. The Caulfield sisters two-stepped
briskly. They pack as many parties into their
youthful lives as a full-fledged, smart-trotting
society woman. Miss de Bavais, whose papa
consulates in this city, looked Frenchily pretty
in white. Baird, of the baton and buttonhole,
strayed happily among so much girl, and the
frisk ran itself on till weary early hours as dances
have a habit of doing. Dances happen by the
hundred, and on the giddy round they gather in a
pack who could be labelled professional private
hoppers. They seem to stay out each frisk from
beginning to end, and are marvels of endurance.
Somebody writes from London :
The Outtrims, senior, pack up their travel-worn Sara-
toga, and ship themselves for Melbourne in August.
They leave the boy here to continue the polishing up of
his angel smile and his mellow G.
Mrs. Carlyle Smvthe is back in this windy town,
muffled in squirrel furs—or that’s how she has
appeared to the naked eye. She is feeling almost
dazed at the five years of travel she and hubby
managed to squeeze into a few months. Carlyle
Smythe brings the redoubtable Foster Frazer in
tow. The Smythes preceded the big man by one
1 boat.
Medico W. R. Boyd doesn’t like to see his bald
head in print. Now he knows what his friends
have to put up with—they see the capacious dome
that needs no brush every time they look at him,
and cheerfulness shines out of it as from a re-
flector. Furthermore, the doctor has a duplicate
brother—who is also a sawbones and also (as I
.persist in remarking) gloriously bald, though
Dr. Tom of the cheerful pair approaches a step
nearer the Paderewski stage than brother Bill.
They are so much alike that it is necessary to try
on their respective hats to discover which is which.
“Bill” Boyd’s hat fits down to the shoulders of
any ordinary human man. They are young Aus-
tralians of considerable weight in their profession.
T. H. Boyd is a surgeon of much importance in
Melbourne Hospital. “Bill” Boyd, physician,
is acknowledged as one of the ablest anaesthetists
(what a beastly word and so hard to spell) in Aus-
tralia. The modern school among medicoes is
beginning to recognise that to administer an
anaesthetic with absolute safety is a special
work demanding special ability and feeling.
Boyd has this “feeling” in a marked degree.
He seems to know by a special sense just the
balance of the patient on hand. The conditions
that go to the settling of the quantity of anaesthetic
are varied and complicated. There is so much
subtlety in keeping the dormant individual on a
leveloi unconsciousness, without an alarming drop
. or rise. There is more and more chance for the
one who is being hacked and skewered, now that
anaesthetics are studied in detail and the chloro-
form-giver is a specialist.
The bachelor Boyds are following the example
of the benedicts of the family which spreads itself
over a considerable portion of this continent.
Rupert of the Boyds is still in the first glory and
radiance of his honeymoon, and now brother
Monty is hurrying to follow suit. He will wed
Miss Newbury—Evelyn Newbury—a Toorakian
social ornament, at the wane of next moon. A
blare of trumpets and much frill will celebrate the
occasion.
Hans Heysen, that beautiful young man who
bears a vague resemblance, in miniature, to the
athletic Clarence Weber and poses on his own
pedestal among artists, has retired to a rustic
place ih his native South Australia, there to
absorb country atmosphere and learn its habits,
that he may catch the unstable stuff whereof
atmosphere is made* and transfer it to canvas.
(This is a long sentence, but I can’t help it.)
Hahndorf is the German name of this Australian
village. Already Heysen has produced a score
and ten of water colors, which Moffat’s are showing
in the gallery in Post Office Place. Most of
them are typically Australian, though a “Wind-
mill ’” (a landmark to motor hogs outside Ade-
laide) is as Dutch as a modern comic opera. It’s
not Heysen’s fault—the Dutch flavor. The
windmill is a ruin of ages, built by lager
bier pioneers. Hahndorf is as German as they
make them, and all the inhabitants prattle
in the tongue of the Vaterlandt mixed
with Australian. A German school, where
the speech is pure sauerkraut, is almost
compulsory. Apart from the “Windmill,” the
pictures are charmingly Australian. Weird white
gums that complain to the windy sky show a
real Australian touch. “A Summer Day” dozes
and dreams in the heat haze that makes Austra-
lian mountains misty ; and a sunset gets at the
intangible purple change in this country of vary-
ing colors. There is a pastel of Sydney Harbor
that is almost blue enough, and an impressionist
patch of old blue gums and battered beehives that
would made a wandering ’Roolander homesick if
he met them “ abrawd.”
The plaintiff in our coming great divorce suit
isn’t going to be “pauped” (as Badalia Herods-
foot expressed it) to any extent owing to her
trouble. Her husband settled £6OOO a year on
her some time back, which strikes one as a tidy
dot, and calculated to keep almost any woman in
hairpins. Rupert can well afford it, He may
not have been happy matrimonially; but in the
matter of wordly gain he seems unable to go
wrong. About his only considerable financial
“ knock” was in connection with the breeding of
thoroughbred horses. And even at this tricky
game he is said to have done less badly by a hat-
ful than many another man might. For the rest,
his multitudinous business enterprises have
turned to gold in his hands. With him, as with
the rest of us, money-making is a hobby—the
difference, in his case, being that luck or some-
thing enables him to gratify his whim pretty
constantly.
Australia’s novelist, Rolf Boldrewood, cele-
brated his 83rd birthday on August 6. The old
gentleman is well, hearty, and clear-headed, and
chuckles when any. mention is made of his great
age. Congratulations and presents ih
upon him at the Browne castle ill ToOrak ; ; f6r he
is a good-natured soul, attd is always ready to
boost up any young wt-itet that is boostable.
Blamire Young, yvhose art is equally bizarre
and business-like, is going to exhibit a collection
of his paintings in Melbourne next month.
Amy Castles, the warbler, arrived on Monday
morning. The rain rained and the winds blew,
and cold noses were in evidence, but that did not
deter the hosts of friends who went down to the
sea in ships to welcome her. She has grown
slight and has developed “a manner.” She cattle
ashore in a natty rig-out of navy tailoring, and
looked sonsy under a Mother Hubbard hat of
black. The McGillicuddies carried her off to a
special lunch at the Grand-—but more of that anon
in a future letter, as Johanna now rushes to press.
The Amy Castles receptions are the rage of
the moment, and are like to knock the Asche
worship into disarray. “To meet the Asches ”
has been a leading attack from every quarter for
“At Homes.” Now the only Amy figures in
special type on fashionable billets. Mrs. George
Langridge is sitting back for a swagger reception
on Monday (16th), with Amy Castles as guest of
honor. Brother George, of the silvery voice, was
spared from “ The Duchess of Dantzic ” crew to
meet sissie at Fremantle. The “ Dantzics,” by
the way, are dancing about the outside towns —
Geelong, etc.—waiting for their “ date ” in Mel-
bourne.
Sunday is J. C. Williamson’s unlucky day, and
Amy Castles seemingly is the harbinger of his
woes. Her Majesty’s, Sydney, has twice caught
fire on a Sunday, and each of the conflagrations
occurred when Amy Castles was within a day’s
journey from Fremantle, on her voyage out from
England. The double concidence is remarkable.
Hugh Ward’s company, with Mrs. Brough and
a huge cast as compared with the small “ Honey-
moon” crowd, put on “The Fencing Master” at
the Princess’s to a great house. Ward surprised the
average theatre-goer by the happy way he por-
trayed a character that was not born of comic
opera. Australia is so used to Hugh Ward in
song-and-dance parts of opera bouffe. Nevertheless
it was in similar work to Angelo Rossi, of “ The
Fencing Master,” that he first made his big suc-
cesses in America. There was no hint of Ward,
the comedian, in this sensitive, delicate old man—
a nobleman impoverished and exiled in a strange
land.
I don’t know when there have been so many
“ leading ladies ” on one set of boards at the same
timewithoutcollisionsand disastrous results. Rosie
Musgrove and Celia Ghiloni have everything to
themselves in the first scene (a gaily exuberant
and gladly ragged supper party) before Mrs.
Brough and Grace Palotta make a simultaneous
entrance as mother and daughter. Miss Palotta
sustains the girlish part and plays a graceful
compliment to Mrs. Brough by practically putting
herself in the background as they enter, so that
the applause has a chance to tumble round
the elder lady in a tumult before she her-
self takes the middle stage. Miss Palotta
does that act in a duck of a pink and lace frock—
straight from Noo York—and a snood of roses in
her hair, and looks like a girl of 20. She wears
about half a dozen materialised dreams throughout
the production, even when she insists on a purple
hat with a pink frock to fit the picture upon which
the hero-artist built the reason of his being. Mrs.
Brough trails a filmy toggery that embodies all
the blues and greens of deep-sea depths, and later
on tops her russet silk gear with a gorgeous
kimona from Chow Land. The twins of the
“Honeymoon,” disguised as guests at this party,
put their share into the frocking. They have
evidently garnered the silk from Asia. Their
crepes are a credit to any worm that ever ate
mulberry. Celia Ghiloni, as the widow of the
Hair-Restorer, treasures the memory of the
deceased maker of her wealth in a black gown that
spells money—money —money—whips of dollars—
stacks of greenbacks. It is moulded out of
fashionable, expensive jet, and shimmers decor-
ously, as the gown of a real millionairess
should. Rose Musgrove wears cute muslins.
They’ll be useful in Colombo, whither she departs
at the end of this season. One is a chiffony thing
that she spreads in an obedient way whenever
Mamma Hair-Restorer begs her to keep it from
crushing. Likewise, Rosie—Miss Brown (and
Mary Brown at that , as her piqued adorer sneers)
wears two anaemic pigtails (“ the Restorer didn’t
do me much good,” she complains) with mammoth
bows. One lingerie gown turned a modest young
man in the stalls apoplectic with embarrassment
on Saturday. He thought it was her petticoat,
and thought she’d forgotten her frock. Another
gown saves the clinging situation with a lifebelt
padded round the middle distance of the skirt.
Altogether, the frocking is a dream to fair
women who find more satisfaction in the
“dresses” than in anything else about a play.
Nevertheless, in spite of the frocks, not a woman
in the house escaped without a tear in her ’een
through Hugh Ward-Rossi’s pathos.
The stalls become more and more the seat of
sassiety at shows. The circle was packed and the
gallery wedged; but the stalls held the Very
Best People. Mrs. Ward was in the manager’s
box with Mrs. Brennan and her councillor
husband and another most gratfe and reverend
seigneur. A most tropical beauty bud shone from
the opposite pen clad in bright scarlet. The
Baillieus partied with the Willie Robinsons, and
young Neil McEacharn headed whatever is mas-
culine for a flapper party. Mrs. Medico Ewing
and hubby brought Dorothy Court. The black
Brasch of the sculling championship Othello-ed
with his most fair fiancee. Mrs. Burrell wore an
Elsa-like robe of faint green and pearls. Mrs.
Watkinson, in black, had pretty daughter Ailsa
in a white frock and scarlet cape. The Bethune
Thompsons partied with them —visiting from
Adelaide-of-the-trams. Everybody did the usual
stunt of supper party in a mild motor-whirl to the
cafes. The Vienna is now almost taboo for sup-
pers. The Early Closing hangs like a sword over
the heads of the eaters.
The most up-to-date touch in the modernised
Shakspeanan production here is the bellows with
which Petruchip’skitcheti wench puffs the tire. It is
the kind that Mrs. Newly-wed buys down Chapel-
street for 2s. llfd. Maybe the bellows of to-day
is the same old implement that Shakspeare knew.
It looks like a survival from the time of Alfred the
Great.
A certain conservative daily carries its snobbish-
ness into excellent detail. An account of the
wreck of the Maori bad a large type list of the
survivors. The captain and officers and chief
engineer were blessed with “ Mr. ” before their
names. Humbler seamen in the same list were
plain “John” or “William,” and when the con-
servative daily didn’t know whether able seaman
Johnson was John or William it called him Dasn (—)
Johnson, the same as it might have Said Popto or
Rover. “Mr.” is the sacred ear-mark of the
“gentleman” with the conservative daily.
Most subtle things go to 'the making of a gentle-
ttia’h, '6r gentlewoman, in the minds of some
authorities. A Melbourne society paper re-
marked [vide “The Taming of the Shrew”) that
“No gentlewoman, even if she had been kept
without food for two days, would appear so
voracious as Katharine” is portrayed by this
company. Evidently a well-bred person. Saved
on the verge of starvation by a jSnJViaen'tial
mutton-bone, would hesitate te pick it up and
gnaw it. ,
The danger of the rhotor-car expressed itself
clearly in Melb'diith'e list week when one of the
tribe, driven by a young chauffeur and a ditto
mechanic, Slithered along Sydney-road at 25 miles
an h'Our. It is a wide road with plenty of room
fOt traffic, but just at the critical moment the
steering gear went wrong, and the machine butted
head first into an on-coming tram. The collision
was considerable, and quite a number of well-to-
do citizens rushed out in dismay under the im-
pression that Socialism had arrived. Nobody was
killed, but a lady was badly damaged ; the two
occupants of the motor were only fit for the hos-
pital ; the tram dummy had to be carted away in
pieces ; and the motor —well, the motor just ceased
to be, that’s all. It evaporated like the old
Hittite empire. Now, supposing that tram had
been coming from a football match, with a load of
30 or 40 on the dummy !
Louise Smith, of the blue eyes, who hobnobbed
with royalty when she was a baby, has had her
grown-up presentation, and is portrayed in London
sassiety papers in all her glad fuss and feathers
and the unnecessary necessity of 3yds. of train.
This was the final bow after a long tripping
through the nooks and crannies of the Foggy
Island, also an interlude of study at Edinboro’
(alias Auld Reekie) University, and several
snatches of Paris. The presentation event was at
the last Court of the season. A Court chronicler
remarked that the large number had waited till
the last gasp “hoping for warmer weather —poor
things”; but, after all, they had to go bare-
necked and (perhaps) blue-nosed into the Presence,
Ruby Seddon, a pretty daughter of Maoriland’s
Dick Seddon, also made her curtsey, as did Mrs,
Hennessy, described by the paper as the wife
of “a prominent member of the Council at
Melbourne.”
From “ Rosna,” of Adelaide
It has stopped raining 1 Bat unless you have b'eeh in
Adelaide during the past month you won’t realise the
true weight of the statement. It is really the most
momentous thing that has happened since—well, since
July 1. There is some talk of bonfires and a procession to
celebrate it. Or perhaps we will get the Governor to
plant a tree. We plant a tree to celebrate nearly every-
thing. And we do lots of worse things.
The twins from the Residence are not going to be out
of any revels. They have now taken to rinking ; and,
judging by their glide, they saw ice before yesterday.
The ’Varsity Rowing Club swarmed upon the Torrens
the other Saturday, and the Arts boat, and the Medical
boat, the Engineering boat and the Science boat had all
their own lots of lace hankies waved at them from the
banks. After some little time it was announced to the
assembled girl that the Engineering boat had gone “ no
trumps ” and won the rub—though I’m not sure if that’s
the right nautical language. Perhaps it had gone “ nap ”
and taken Kitty, or perhaps there had been a scrum in
the chess match and the boat had kicked a goal. Any-
way, it was understood that the engineers-to-be will hold
the honors for at least a year. A new boatshed was
opened to the world during the proceedings, and its
interior was found to contain tea and other decorations.
Then a new boat was dragged out from obscurity, and
Mrs. Darniey Naylor, the tall wife of the tall Professor,
with Rex Wallmann to aid and abet her, gave it a bottle
of champagne, and asked it to remember that its god-
fathers and godmothers christened it “ Balliol.”
We have been meeting with brigands and highwaymen
on our moonlit wanderings lately. One night a careful
policeman put his head inside someone’s gate in a spirit
of scientific inquiry, and was immediately felled. Another
night, at 9 o’clock, a lady on South Terrace was giving
the week’s rent a walk, concealed in the left-hand pocket
of her silver-mounted purse, when two villains bagged the
heroine—and the purse. The heroine yelled ; five heroes
dashed to her rescue ; the villains fled off across the park,
taking the rent and leaving the inevitable clue, which
the police are guarding, securely chained, at the police-
station. The clue declines to say anything, however, and
the only consolation about the story is that the rent was
not large. Also, on the 3rd, Mrs. Legoe asked Henley
Beach in to dance; and while the house was deserted
and the family was revelling at the local hall,
burglars helped themselves to much of her decorative
wealth and some cash., Then, in a burst of quaint humor,
they chopped up a chest of drawers with an axe.
Another evening a band of marauders called at the Tom
Scarfe’s place, Eden Park. But this lot had been pro-
perly invited, and it was not large enough to do
serious damage anyway. The two cherubs of the house
of Scarfe, who welcomed the onrush, were raimented.one
as a most magnificent little Queen of Hearts, the other
as Princess Elizabeth in a long white satin robe slashed
with pale blue, and with pearls and lace on her curly mane.
Among those in the strayed Waratah are the London-
bound Alexander Hays, mother and maiden. Fate
seems to have been pursuing them of .late with more
vigor than politeness. The other day, as you may
remember, they were burned put of their ancestral
mansion at Pt. Victor, and to be drowned on top of that
would be most annoying.
Those other wanderers, the John Lewis, father and
daughter, have added a motor-car to the family, so as to
climb over the countenance of Britain with speed and
comfort.
Clytie Hine has been lifting her voice at a concert in
London. Kindly note that I make the statement with
due modesty. I would not swear that the concert was
in the Albert Hall. I don’t insist that Edward VII. was
at it. So the people who wail about the Australian papers’
pernicious habit of advertising the achievements of the
Commonwealth’s daughters needn’t fasten their talons
upon me. But Ido say that, since Clytie has only been
in London a few months, it is something at least that she
has sung at a concert there.
Some of the Beach family, lately wandering through
Europe, ran up against the Loubledays in Vienna. They
write to friends in this village, with pens of flaming rhetoric,
about the progress of fiddler Leila, and of the shoals of
engagements offered her. But the wise professor shakes

A Great Musical Invention
“Steinway-Welte,”
After many inventions and many failures—
A PERFECT INSTRUMENT,
An Instrument of Reproduction.
Exact and individual renderings of classical music played by the World’s
(greatest Pianists.
STEINWAY-WELTE consists of an Upright Pianoforte with a pneumatic
attachment, which is actuated by electricity instead of foot power. This
attachment represents the highest possible development of the pneumatic
piano-player, inasmuch as it furnishes a reproduction of the actual interpre-
tation placed upon the written score of a great composer by the great modern
executant. In the words of a well-known musician, “Itis a photograph.”
OPERATION.
After the insertion of the perforated roll, a button is pressed, which starts
the motor; the tempo lever is set to the mark which represents the exact
time at which the artist played.
Every piece rendered with distinction, for over 100 artists of renown have
played for this instrument.
It immortalises a single performance so that the touch of a pianist who has even
now passed away may be handed down to remote posterity.
The regret of musicians must ever be that this great invention was not brought
out in 1809 instead of 1909.
,' i**"'
Opinions of the World’s Fanums Musicians may be seen on application.
The Stein way-Welte” may also be used as an ordinary piano at immediate notice.
This INSTRUMENT is for you to SEE and HEAR,

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Wherever two or three men are gathered to-
gether there will sport flourish—yea, verily, and there
will gold and silver be wagered on the result thereof.
Even in northern Alaska, with the thermometer linger-
ing away down below zero, they have their little flutter.
The Derby or Melbourne Cup of this exalted latitude
takes the form of a dog-sled race, conducted by the Nome
Kennel Club, over a 412-mile course from Cripple Creek
to Nome. This year the event started on April 1, and
24 hours were knocked off the previous best. The Berger
team finished the run in 82hr. 2min., thereby capturing
the stake of £2200 and annexing the right to hold a gold
cup, known as the Sutor Trophy, for one year. The race
started in a blizzard, and the temperature during the
whole journey ranged from 15 to 20 degrees below zero.
The miners and all the doggy men in the land put up
their money in piles. Over £20,000 was laid on the
favorites—a team known as Fink’s Siberian dogs. As
favorites generally do, they finished third. It was a
great race all the way, the second team passing the post
only 17min. behind the winners. It was doubtless
an interesting event, yet it sounds curious to people
accustomed to English and Australian racecourses. If
the Melbourne Cup started at Melbourne and finished at
Goulburn, in N.S.W., and the first horse, leaving Mel-
bourne on Tuesday afternoon, passed the post, amid great
applause, next Saturday morning before daybreak, it
would seem like a departure from the usual order of
things. They must be a patient race—these people who
gamble wildly on a sporting event which lasts three days
and ten hours.
* • * •
It was speed, more speed, and speed all the
time that killed Ponsonby’s porker at Sydney Cricket
Ground on Saturday last, when the Sydney Metropolitan
team fell on it. It was obvious from the kick-off that the
game was going to be fast and willing; and expectation was
not disappointed. But the referee was on the W'arpath,
and the cautions were served out hot and strong before
the trouble had time to come to the boil. A week in the
Babylonish city had done the Aucklanders anything but
good, and their form seemed inferior to what they
showed when they stepped off the boat Saturday week
morning, or on Wednesday when they blew out South
Sydney by 25 points to six. By the time the second
spell was half-way through the Auckland pack was appar-
ently winded and things dragged with it; while the
Cornstalks were as nippy as ever, and never once
slackened the speed that had characterised their opening
rush. Excepting in occasional spasms the Ponsonby
team was on the defensive, with its back to its goal
line, struggling copiously. Curiously enough it was
always after clearing its line that it struck trouble.
During one of these spasms it lifted the score from nil to
nine points, and at half-time led by nine to five. But it
was a mere flash. After the resumption, the Sydney men
got all over their opponents, drove them back to their
line, pierced their defence twice with a converted goal
and a try ; and came out victorious by 13 points to nine.
This defeat of the Ponsonby men was a sur-
prise ; but it was a mild sensation, after all, to the over-
throw of the All-Maoris by Newcastle on the previous
Wednesday. N.S.W. stood still and wondered if there
were visions about when the whispering wires announced
that at half-time Newcastle was seven points to the
Maoris’ nil. So did the Maoris, and they started the
second half with a tremendous rush. The word
was given to bullock (or even elephant) right through
everything. The time for pretty tactics had gone
by ; brute force was the only thing left. Newcastle
returned the compliment with some of the finest samples
of Scotch navigation seen in the coaly town for a long
time ; and there were snarls when the packs met. The
crowd swayed about in dumb delight till Tuki, streaking
like a meteor down the field, caught the ball in mid-air
and flashed through over the line, and scored. But the
elements were against him, and the wind blew his goal
away. The Maoris grew frantic; and some of their
dashes were splendid. Then Pakere came soaring
through the air (his feet only touched the ground once)
caught the flying ball and raced away, followed by Wiki-
riwhi. With something like an oath, Newcastle heaved
itself bodily at Pakere ; and he was dragged down, but
as he went he passed to Wikiriwhi, who bounded clean
over the heads of those who tried to stop him and shot
across the line. At this hideous spectacle the Newcastle
barrackers, who had been momentarily deprived of the
power of speech, burst into a long dog-howl of horror
and dismay. Time was running out, and Tuki came
prancing down the field to kick the goal that meant
defeat to Newcastle. Women wept and gasped, and men
prayed openly and unashamed, begging the Creator to
“stiffen” Tuki, put out the sun, do anything but
let the brown citizen get that goal. And Tuki’s
kick went a full yard outside the post amid a
wild if ribald burst of joy. Newcastle had won by
seven to six. It is expected that work will be resumed
some time next week. Meanwhile the hotel-keepers are
telegraphing in all directions for more drink.
However, worse things than that were in store
for the Maoris. On Saturday last the team found another
Waterloo in Brisbane, where the local Leaguers downed
and outed it by 21 points to 11. The outstanding feature
of the game was the catching of Asher by M'Gregor, the
Queensland full back. Asher tried the swallow trick,
attempting to jump clean over M‘Gregor. But the High-
land person got him by the right leg just as he reached
his zenith, and Asher saw several new universes. This
jumping business is played out, and Asher knows it now.
The N.S.W. Rugby Union’s invasion of Queens-
land was, as usual, successful, and after two decisive
engagements Brisbane is nowin the hands of the Corn-
stalks, the local defenders having been again walloped
by 13 points to six. As usual, Carmichael kicked in a way
to make the angels weep with envy; but one kicker isn’t
a football team, and a fullback who does the work of
three men is a poor substitute for scrum-halves who fail
to come round quick enough to smother the leather. It
was the fact that they were permitted to get the ball out
to the backs and let loose passing charges in quick
succession that gave the Cornstalks the game.

The South Melbourne team is at present in
Sydney making a brave attempt to foster the Australian
game of football in the N.S.W. capital. But if all the
clubs in Melbourne were to come they could not do more
than the local men are doing. The Australian game is in
a hopeless plight, and will remain so till the League can
get some enclosed grounds where it can collect revenue
with which to push things. Under happier circum-
stances the Australian game would boom in Sydney ; but
as things are only enthusiasts will follow it. The wonder is
that it has so many enthusiasts as it has. The South
Melbourne team gave a fine exhibition of the chess-like
qualities of the game, for of all the forms of hoofball the
Australian one is far and away the most scientific. The
N.S.W. men played up well, and at half-time were only
one point (30 to 31) behind their formidable opponents.
But the perfect combination and machine-like precision
of the South Melbourne kicking was too deadly, and
when the final bell rang N.S.W. had slumped, and the
record was 52 to 79.
* * * *
There was considerable football in Melbourne
last week, most of it of the spurious or Brum description.
On Monday Sydney University demonstrated the alleged
merits of the Rugby game to a Victorian 15 and about 100
spectators, the experts casually totting up a goal and
three tries to the novices’ two tries. On Wednesday a
weak League team collided with a band of pilgrims from
Boulder City (W.A.), and amused about 2000 spectators
by languidly notching 103 points to 43. Boulder City is
understood to have been trapesing round for amusement;
but by the time it got to Melbourne it seems to have
realised that the game wasn’t worth the gate, so to
speak ; wherefore it packed up its duds and departed.
Its takings on the tour are instructive—Adelaide, £275 ;
Broken Hill, £326 ; Ballarat, £B9 ; Bendigo, £79 ; and
Melbourne, £36. On Thursday, Essendon and Port Ade-
laide indulged in a casual, accidental spell of exercise—
which ended in the former acquiring 75 points ; the latter,
68—the most notable feature of which was the great size
of the Croweater ’bailers. Heaven only knows why these
episodes transpire—possibl.y the Fusionists have some-
thing to do with it, or it may be some subtle move of
Reid’s to secure the High Commissionership.
On Saturday there were but two League games
down for decision —Saints v. Geelong, and Essendon v.
’Wood. The former didn’t count in the scheme of
things; but the latter counted a lot, wherefore some
35,000 persons squeezed themselves into the little East
Melbourne ground, and lamented the disgorging of £6OO
of good coin when it was all over. According to the laws
of evidence, Essendon, after its Thursday’s game, should
have been stiff and weary, while Collingwood, after
its week’s rest, with its recent victories over Carlton
and South to inspire it, and with a stiff breeze at its back
in the first quarter, should have piled up enough points
in that quarter to have broken the ’Dons’ hearts. Instead
the Collingwooders piled up just 18, while the ’Dons
scored 20. At half-time the ’Dons’ tally was 56 to the
same 18. Getting the wind again, ’Wood still failed to
make any headway, and the rout finished with ’Don 98
points, ’Wood 42. The “Same Old ” played a fast, clever,
strenuous game ; but the Magpies simply weren’t play-
ing, with three or four honorable exceptions. As ’Wood
has now lost its foremost place—with the double chance
for the premiership—and cannot regain it unless South
and Carlton are both beaten, this latest manoeuvre
was incomprehensible; but this writer remembers
a semi-final game two years ago when, after the
Magpies had similarly acted the goat, the then
captain, on removing his guernsey', swore he would
never put it on again to play for the club. On Saturday,
Captain Nash’s language was something paralysing, but
it was addressed to his own men —and some of them
deserved it. There have been two episodes this season
that the writer would give at least sixpence to learn the
ins and outs of ; one was Carlton’snine goalsin 20 minutes,
with the consequent defeat of South ; the other was
Collingwood’s absolute incapacity on Saturday'. The
Saints-Geelong concussion, probably because there was
nothing hanging to it, was genteel and artistic. Saints
finally arrived by 26 points to 22, and thereby share the
bottom rung of the League ladder with their opponents.
* it 9 ♦
As to the Victorian Football Ass., all its games
were off, to avoid undue interference with the inter-State
collision— v. South ’Oss —at the North Melbourne gluepot.
This paddock, having been drained and rolled and gener-
ally dolled up, is now a cheerful piece of scenery and is
hereby re-christened the Sponge. Its edges soaked up
some 6000 spectators on Saturday, who barracked most
impartially' ; and though the Ass. kicked the more
strenuously the bogging-in on both sides was elegant and
dispassionate. The discussion was practically over by
three-quarter time, when the Vies., with a one-point lead,
secured the wind and made the final tally 65 to 38 ; but
up to then the episode was as full of possibilities as an air-
ship with a punqture. Of the eight matches played the
Vic. Ass. has now won three. And to avoid unseemly
disputes and uproarious arguments, this paper adds the
information that South ’Oss. has won five.
Other happenings connected with the “great
winter game ” were the fining of four obstreperous
’bailers of Burramine, which is beyond Benalla, in sums
totalling £2O ; the damaging of a small boy at East Mel-
bourne when the crowd slopped over the fence and the
players trod on the crowd ; the breaking of the leg of
another youthful barracker, who tried to scale the
fence but made a bad job of it; and the lamented
death of a Toora school-teacher, who, when playing
for that Gippsland township, was accidentally
but severely kicked in the groin. Also one
of Tait’s ill-regulated football specials, when leaving
Geelong, walked over a buggy' containing a man and a
hoy, and pushed both to a place where football and
specials are not. Furthermore, the Richmond beaks
recovered £lO in fines from certain barrackers who broke
out into violent argument about last week’s Essendon-
’Roy game. This habit of arguing fiercely about a thing
that is past and gone, and doesn’t matter, and never did
matter, anyhow, is a lamentable dijsease and a waste of
much “ blime ” : still it helps the revenue a trifle at times.
By far the prettiest game in Melbourne on
Saturday was the S.A.-Vic. lacrosse match. Lacrosse
combines the life and nerve and system of football with
the individual excellence and scientific accuracy of
cricket, and the more it is played the more it seduces
adherents of both the other games. The Crow-eaters had
most of their stars away playing against Westralia; others
came with this team on their way to Tassy, but the 12
who met the Murray Staters were no novices, and a joyous
and sparkling game ensued. Passing on both sides was
pretty, and though the Victorians’ shooting at the net was
faulty at first they presently corrected it, and half-time
saw them leading by three goals to two. After that the
superb catching and general stick work of the Croweaters
took the eye ; but some of them lacked the pace of their
opponents, and want of combined practice obviously left
them unable to cope with the Vic. combination. The
ultimate score—Vic., nine goals; S.A., five—was well
earned, and gave the Gumsuckers their first win since ’O4
and their fourth out of the 17 matches that have been
played.
• * * •
The “ conditional ” offer of a prize of £5OOO for
an aeroplane capable of being used in time of war, is
threatening, according to Defence Minister Cook, to
swamp his office with plans for flying-ships. Cook is
apparently under the impression that £5OOO is a really
munificent offer—which proves what sort of a mind Cook
has got. Of course, the really effective aeroplane—the
one that can carry guns, ammunition and men in
thousands, is at present under the horizon. But the
fact remains that if mechanism can be devised to carry an
aeroplane weighing 5001 b., it is only a case of developing
power, and 500 tons can be lifted equally well. To offer
£5OOO for the secret of an aerial battleship is about the
most grotesque thing this remarkable man has yet per-
petrated. Almost any other country on earth would pay
£1,000,000 right away, and use the first fleet to recover the
cost and a handsome profit on the transaction.
Which reminds of a remark that should have
been made long ago. The whole world is just now filled
with dread of the aerial navy. Hideous pictures have
been drawn of the helpless position of the people down
below. But it won’t work out so. Aeroplanes, just
because they depend for safety on vanes, will always be
peculiarly susceptible to injury. The aerial torpedo will
follow so closely on the heels of the aerial ship (it is, in
fact, here now) that the chances of anyone using either
of them in warfare will be strictly limited, till such time
as man has discovered means of developing much more
power than can be got from any machinery to-day. Till
the boiler-maker and the engine-builder have improved
things a lot, the armored aeroplane is impossible ; and
nothing but the armored type will make any appreciable
difference in war time, except to give a few people the
jumps and wipe out a city or two. A small model weigh-
ing 451 b., machinery, explosive and all, will wreck the
biggest aeroplane or dirigible balloon likely to be made for
many a year to come, and kill every man on board, or
what might be worse for him, drop him badly smashed
into the hands of an exasperated enemy.

If the present rate of fining for furious motor
driving is continued in England, Lloyd-George will find
his huge Budget unnecessary. In some localities the
fines are mounting to hundreds of pounds per week, and
the magistrates are complaining that £lO is not a suffici-
ently heavy’ penalty. The gilded hogs who drive over
everybody’ don’t mind paying a tenner for the fun ; they
regard it as a gamble, and take the risks cheerfully’. So
now there is an agitation to give the courts authority to
deal out hard labor. Why on earth Britain doesn’t adopt
the German Act, Heaven only knows. That and a decent
tariff are about the only things the Cold Country' doesn’t
import from the land of the Kaiser.

The motor hog has been devastating some of the
most beautiful of English roads. The dust and the
petrol fumes have destroyed the hedges, ruined the
orchards and gardens, and made the houses uninhabit-
able. All sorts of dust layers have been tried, especially
crude petroleum ; but in that terrific rush of motors—in
some places as many as 280 have been known
to screech past between sunrise and sunset—nothing
seemed to avail. In fact, the petroleum came into the
gardens along with the dust, and produced even more
disastrous results. Now it has been discovered that
chloride of calcium will do the trick ; and it is being
applied to over 300 miles of motor-ridden roads with great
feuccess. How it is applied, this writer knoweth not.
But it is said to be free from odor, and so far there is no
word of any district being set on fire after a shower of
rain. It might be worth while for the Sydney corpora-
tion to inquire into this.

Australian engineer Charles Relph, creator of
the Invincible, Magic, and other all-Australian motor
boats, and the inventor of the motor engine called after
his beautiful green boat, has severed his connection with
the Mort’s Dock Engineering Co. and started in business
as a consulting engineer, in Pitt-street, Sydney. On
limited means Mr. Relph made a brave struggle to create
an Australian motor industry, and now he is in business
for himself he deserves well of his countrymen. Truly’,
he has turned importer ; but if every other citizen bad

Motorist Nazzaro recently attempted to break
world-records for three distances at the Brooklands
track. In the afternoon he met an interested acquaint-
ance who had not heard the result. “ How did y’ou get
on?” inquired the friend. “Oh, very bad, couldn’t get
up pace. Got a pin hole in the back t,yre and just
crawled along. Never travelled so slowly in my life.
Couldn’t get over 110 miles an hour to save my life. Hor-
rible, wasn’t it! ” The interested friend agreed it was.

Thoroughgood, who was anxious to row Hagney,
is in trouble over his stake money'. Raymond Terrace
will not put up cash to be battled for in Sydney, so
Thoroughgood cheerfully offers to row’ any man in the
world on the Hunter River. Apparently his backers
have got him down.

After all, it seems that sculling on the Thames
in England is not such a lucrative business as alleged.
Towns and Barry divided only £l3O between them.
Under these circumstances it is hard to see why Barry
refuses to come to Australia to pull on the Parramatta.
It has been given out that his backers will not put up the
money for a race that the most of them would be unable
to see. But, on the other hand, more than one English
paper has howled that it is the honor and not the boodle
that Barry and his backers are after. Sculling is
apparently at a low ebb in England when there are not
enough ambitious persons in the second or third wealthiest
country in the world to finance a man who is unusually
fast, and the only individual in sight who has a chance
against the great Maoriland sculling machine.

N.S.W. will rely upon Nigel Barker at the
coming Australian Championship Athletic gathering at
Brisbane in the 100yds., 220yds., 440yds., 880yds., and
the broad jump. Altogether, this is a fearful load to pile
on to one man ; but Nigel was ever a willing horse, and
in consequence his backbone is being sadly strained.

“Adelaide”: Surely this Australian XI. wil
go down to history as the luckiest on the records!
In its first four tests it beat England twice, and
made one favorable draw, so it keeps the “ashes”
here. Those three feats were due to fine bits
of bowling by separate men; once Armstrong, once
Macartney (assisted by Cotter), once Laver. Yet up
to this date, and barring those tests, it has not won any
other game worth mentioning. For three months it has
gone about slaughtering the weak teams—though even
there it had a desperate finish with feeble Leicester and
Somerset, and was morally beaten by the unreckoned
Scotland. Against any strong county it has generally
been in difficulties from the jump. Yet it wins test
matches. I would prefer to believe (if I could) that Eng-
land is really stronger in talent but weaker in nerve than
Australia, and cannot reproduce its training-track form
on the course ; while our men can set their teeth and do
a bit better than their previous best when the real trial
comes.
• * * ■*
The Australians’ effort against Lancashire pro-
duced their lowest score to time of writing— a miserable
87, of which Armstrong made 43 not out. Curiously
enough, 87 is also the lowest score made against the
Australians, England making that number in the third
Test. It was in this upheaval that Hopkins came to the
top of the pot with six wickets for 15.
Up to time of writing the Australian XI. has
won 12, lost three and drawn 12 matches in Bull Lind.
The three defeats happened in the dark days, when Eng-
land was without a sun, and the ball swished into the
wicket 6in. below the slush and water. The sky is now
blue and the garden smiling.

A band of Westralian cricketers recently stood
on the sea-shore and looked across the chrysoprase sea to
where the spicy breezes blow soft o’er Ceylon’s Isle. Then
they wrote asking for particulars re gate and guarantee.
Back came the reply that the Ceylon gentry did not
understand the term “ gate,” having been well brought
up. From inquiries, however, they gathered that it had
something to do with a charge for admission. But all
visitors to Ceylon came as gentlemen and paid their own
expenses, and if the Westralians liked to come under those
conditions, the gentlemen of Ceylon would have no-
haw—objection to giving them a few matches. Most of
these Westralians are now convalescent.

The best amateur billiards “form” shown in
Melbourne this winter by any of the local players was that
of “Alma,” who won the Victorian Club tournament
from scratch. In his final heat he had to give 185 points
in 250 to his opponent, and seeing that the “ mug ” had
won all of his heats up to then and was quite capable of
making a 20 break on occasion, the scratch man’s achieve-
ment in giving him 74 in 100 and beating him by 19 points
was a fine display. He had to play a dashing game to
rattle off 250 whilst the experienced “mug” scored
only 46. “Alma” is a young and popular member of
Melbourne Stock Exchange.

The £l3OO hurdle race, run at Caulfield last
Saturday, fell to the well-treated Nightlight, in the
Manifold ownership. The handicapper was very kind to
Nightlight in consideration of his apparently bad per-
formance in the Grand National at Flemington, and with
only 9st. 131 b. to carry, the 6-year-old—six only since the
beginning of the month—won easily. Half a mile from
home Fossil promised to fight out the finish, but he tired,
and left the race at the mercy of the nag that won. They
were the two youngest animals in the field. In a very
long hurdle race, youth is very apt to tell if it isn’t
absolutely juvenile.
The big Steeplechase next Saturday is a different
proposition. Bribery ran well enough in the Hurdle
Race, and his capacity to go four miles over the bigger
sticks was proved when he ran second to Nigel, carrying
12st. 91b., two years ago. Last month he won the Grand
National Steeplechase with 12st. 111 b. up. If D. J. Price
has anything much better than Bribery for the coming-
event it will be a pretty good thing—bar accidents.
Which is a very strong bar, anyhow. A bookmaker the
other day remarked that the only horse he ever backed
for a jumping race was blank}' Accidents.
During S. Australia’s Inst racing year totalisator
investments grew from £313,000 to £388,000. The extra
crop was mostly on metropolitan courses, which now
gather in nearly all the money that used to go through
tote-shops and bookmakers. The machine kept a com-
mission of 10 per cent.—say £40,000. The Government
takes one fourth of that, and the promoting race clubs
keep £30,000, which is very nearly the value of the stakes
run for. That money was very well cut up ;22 owners
won over £5OO each, but nobody won as much as £l4OO.
Koran and Pygmalion sired most winners, but the stock
of Grafton, Pistol, Wallace and Bobadil won most money.

That venerable pitch dark warrior, Brother
Rawlins, alias Starlight, put up a very pleasing enter-
tainment in his fight with Lee of South Africa, at Mel-
bourne Oyclorama, last week. Starlight is about 50, and
is a grandparent in two or three places, but for a limited
term he is as lively and spry a fighter ns there is in the busi-
ness. He knows the game, and has a few neat tricks of
his own. When he feels he is failing as a serious pro-
position he lapses into low comedy, and the public gets
its pound of meat one way or the other. On the above
auspicious occasion the sable veteran led Mr. Lee a yery
lively dance for 10 rounds, during which he did things
that seriously disagreed with the S’African, and disturbed
the symmetrical flow of his features. Then Star became
the corner comedian and collapsed, abreathless Ethiopian,
in the 13th round. Lee won on the strength of his
rawhide physique and the superior durability of his
windmill.
A CONVERTED PUG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Fer years and years I led a joyous life,
Stoushin* me feller-man upon the eye.
I was a champeen then. ’Mid splosh and strife
And swank I lived, and was unfit to die.
Ah 2 them was glad and glowin’ times, my friends’
Days when I moved round, independent, free !
Yet, as some thinker ’ath it, “ all things ends ”
Which woz, at length, exemplified in me.
One night I crorsed the ring-ropes out o’ nick,
(Loard! Loard 2 the fights that ’ave been lost by
drink !),
My adversary Red, or “ Ginger ” Mick,
Parst me ther slumber-stroke while yer might wink.
I fought once more ; alarse, once more I done
A grovel on the floor in ’orrid pain ;
I took ther count ’mid ’oots. Me punch was gone,
I knoo. I never scrapped fer cash again.
Instead I went and bought a jemmy, strong
And serviceable, lanterns fer to see
By night, and gloves and suchlike, which belong
Unto the wicked trade o’ burglary.
Nightly I’d sally forth to earn a crust,
Un’ fer a while I didn’t do too crook.
Un’ then the Lor (friends, I had nearly cussed)
Stepped in and pinched me with its cold, ’ard ’ook,
I done a stretch in gaol. When I got free
The Johns all knoo me like a bosom pal.
They jugged me constant. . . . Then an old Beak ’e
Threatened ter make me a “ ’Abitual."
Some’ow ’is words brort light into me soul.
The days when fights meant cash was long gone by.
My pitch wuz queered fer crime. Picture the ’ole
I stood in. Work, ’ard honest work, loomed nigh.
A weaker bloke might ’ere ’ave ceased ter strive,
An’ drowned hisself—that never was my way.
I rose an’ sought the Loard, an’ now I thrive
By being “ saved ” in the garish light o’ day.

OflTand On —Mass of Small, Watery
Spots Came on Hands, Feet, Legs
and Head —lrritation was Fearful
—Sought Different Doctors and
Skin Hospitals in Vain,
FOUND “WONDERFUL”
CURE IN CUTICURA
"I have suffered off and on with ec-
zema for forty years in my hands, feet,
legs and head. It always came in a
mass of small spots and a considerable
quantity of watery matter used to come
from them. I have been under many
different doctors and in different hos-
pitals for the treatment of the skin (in
one for sixteen weeks and it only got
worse) but derived little or no benefit.
Last year I commenced using the Cuti-
cura Remedies. The first tin of Cuti-
cura Ointment began to heal the sores
and gave me great relief from the fear-
ful irritation. Since then I have used
two more tins of Cuticura with Cuticura
Soap and Pills and am quite well which,
considering the years I have suffered
with eczema, I consider wonderful. I
can candidly say the Cuticura Remedies
alone were the only things that cured
me. I have already persuaded one of
my friends to give them a trial, and
shall continue to recommend them.
Too much can never be 6aid in Cuti-
cura’s favor. Mrs. Marie Spencer, 9,

of rate, 1 turn, from an impressive daily paper leader
anent the public educational advantages o'f morning
dailies and the consequent advisability of the State carry-
ing the said dailies free of charge in'its trains, to gram-
matical bloomers of an evil brand. This painfullv-mixed
metaphor appeared in a Herald leading article (13/7/’09):
Some of the recent pressure upon Mr. Wade may thus
have been prompted by the personal hopes and fears of
keenly interested followers; just as the criticisms of the
Opposition may have an earnest desire for power and the
emoluments of office behind them, as well as some leaven
of honest purpose to keep the springs of patronage pure
and untainted.” c ' *

keep springs “pure and untainted,” I picked up my I).

M'Kenzie, a Manly butcher, employ's Francis
M Oarthy to drive his horse and cart. The latter was
delivering some orders in Victoria-parade on Saturday
morrHug, and the horse being usually a tractable animal
left his cart unguarded for a moment. Then the horse
bolted.
How does a dumb, insensate thing like a cart deliver
orders? What sort of a horse is it that leaves his cart
unguarded ? Why did the horse bolt from his unguarded
vehicle, ouch questions unceasingly exercise the intel-
lect of your chronic daily paper student; but they don’t
increase his stock of exact information, nor do they

£ r u m A correspondentin Ja P an The London Times,
which did a great deal to bring about the Anglo-Jap.
Alliance, is evidently beginning to have doubts about the
brown half of the unholy team ; and recently it has
grown frankly suspicious about his games in China. This
has made the Monkey do’some hard thinking; for he has
an idea that if he ca,n’t keep the big foreign journals on
ms s]de, he will have a hard struggle to carry out his
ambitions. Evidently he has been making representa-
tions on the subject; wherefore Chirol, the Times foreign
editor, has made a special visit to Tokyo, and he and Hr.
Morrison, the Times representative in China, have been
deep in consultation with Jap Ministers and diplomats
Morrison is evidently regarded as the thorn in Japan’s
side , and no end of trouble is being- taken to persuade
him and his foreign editor that their suspicions—
especially with regard to the Eukamen railway—are quite
unfounded. In Japan the conferences are regarded as of
tremendous importance, and the future attitude of The
Times will be watched here with extraordinary interest.
For if the Foreign Office in Tokyo can’t persuade the visi-
tors that it is going-straight, then K. Monkey has made
u p his mind that his hold on J. Bull is about at an end ;
and that wouldn t suit him at all just now. It mi°-ht
later; but he isn’t ready yet.”

“Cabalist”: An interesting newspaper combat has
entered upon its second stage in Wellington (Maoriland).
It is now war even to the fish-slice between the new
Tory morning paper, the Dominion, and the old Govern-
ment organ, the Times. When the Dominion commenced
operations in October, 1907, money was shovelled out in
a fashion which threatened to bring the grey hairs of the
Times with horror to the grave. The Dominion people
were satisfied to unload some thousands of pounds to
establish themselves, and they unloaded right enough
Their paper lost £7OOO during the first year of its
existence, and had £3OOO in book debts at the ter-
mination of the year. The major portion of the
book debts were probably worth nil. When a new
paper opens shop it is generally inundated with adver-
tisements from bad marks, bad eggs, bad hats, and such-
like people. The new journal has to find out at its own
expense who are “kosher” and who are not. The Do
minion, now in its 22nd month, has got a fair start but
the novelty of a new daily has worn off, and the Times has
put on an unprecedented spurt. Its shareholders at
their recent annual meeting, unanimously decided to issue
another £50,000 worth of ordinary shares • and
between £35,000 and £40,000 worth have already been
placed. The Times is the leading public-house
organ, and Brother Pub must keep it alive.
On the last day of June, as a result of the local option
poll, no less than 107 hotels throughout Maoriland had to
cease from business, and, as a consequence, another
20,000 people or so have taken to buying their whisky by
the case and their beer by the keg, and keeping it in the
house. The next election threatens to be the publican’s
retreat from Moscow, and he needs help. Then again the
Times stands for everything that emanates from Premier
Ward, while the Dominion is purely Opposition. So
again the Times must be kept with at least one
leg out of the tomb. When the Dominion (capital
£100,000) decided to slay the Times inside four
months, it overlooked one possibility. Just when
things looked their worst, Pierce Freeth was in-
stalled in the new Times as editor and boss emperor.
Freeth had made a big success of a country paper arid
his ability came under the notice of the haggard magnates
at Wellington. In years gone by he was their own chief
reporter, but just because he was right under their own
eye, they didn’t recognise his capacity then. Freeth
booted the Times into activity, and the race between
the two papers is now fairly level. Neither publication is
likely to bloat and demoralise its shareholders with
dividends for a long while, although the Times has been
guilty of paying one div. in eight years. Both papers are
now shoving business hard in the country districts and
the harried bush editor doesn’t know which of them he
hates worst.

Before the scorn of men of birth
The vulgar villain falls ;
He wriggles worm-like on the earth
Or in the marble halls,
And grits his molars with a will,
Regardless of his dentist’s bill.
Oh ! cold contempt of frigid dukes
To common men addrest!
The deadly cold, polite rebukes
Straight from the cold ice-chest,
Delivered in a lofty tone,
Chill gory villains to the bone.
Cold steel—or hot—is of no use
To punctuate his Grace ;
He wields his bevelled-edged abuse
Dike some great verbal mace.
(The repartee of dukes is worse
Than e’en a practised pirate’s curse !)
Who would encounter and destroy
A haughty, arctic peer
Must study closely as a boy
The art of Plow to Sneer ;
IJis IP’s he must sound with ease
And never drop his final G’s.

IN BANANA LAND
The tireless bloodhound of fiction is a
poor, enervated thing beside the modern bush-
crafty policeman. In connection with the recent
Chinchilla (Q.) murder, of which an ex-black-
tracker was suspected, two Bananaland policemen
put up something of a record. Picking up the
nig’s tracks at the scene of slaughter, they followed
them to Condara, an out-station, 75 miles away.
Here they discovered that the Wanted one had
tried to bargain some of the proceeds of his crime
for tucker. Encouraged a bit, they nosed the scent
again, and hung on to it doggedly for another
trifle of 430 miles to Aramac. At this place, the
policemen opined that the quarry was making for
liis home in the Gulf country, so they fled baqk
another 500 miles to Rockhampton, where they
took boat another 2000 miles or so to Norman-
ton. Here they took prolonged seating accom-
ENLIGHTENED.

modation and waited. Presently a travel-worn
but elated colored homicide arrived well on time,
and was just looking: out a place of peace and well-
earned rest, when the Law fell on him with a
suddenness which obliterated the knowledge of
what had struck him.
They are inquiring for the oldest white
native of, Queensland, in this year of jubilee.
Mrs. J. M. McDonald, born in Brisbane on Sep-
tember 24, 1840, is put up for the distinction.
She is a daughter of .Tames Warner, the surveyor
who plotted out Brisbane, and afterwards was
Sergeant-at-Arms in the Assembly.
Queensland has been a riot of jubilees
lately. Rockhampton had one the other day : not
that it is 50,years old itself, but it has a Scotchby-
terian parson. Dr. Hay, who half a century ago
began to say, “And now one word more in con-
clusion, brethren.’’ Of those 50 years, 33 have
been spent in Rockhampton. The doctor was
ordered out to Australia 40 years ago to save his
life ; and he took his frail tabernacle of clay to the
tropics (where the white man can’t live), and has
remained vigorous enough to be not merely
meenister of Rockhampton, but also Moderator of
the Presbyterian Assembly of Australia.
Queensland has had word of another
nominee for the jubilee honor of being its oldest
native-born white child. It is a woman, of
course—Mrs. McDonald, of Maidenhead station.
She was born on September 24, 1840, in the official
quarters in George-street, Brisbane, where the
Government Savings Bank now stands. Her
father, James Warner, was the surveyor who laid
out Brisbane. He was, subsequently, sergeant-
at-arms in the Assembly, and continued until his
death to tap obstreperous members on the shoulder
and show them the nearest hole in the wall.
The Lure of Beyond.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’M swinging in a hammock that hangs between
the trees,
With Gippsland hills behind me—but east-
ward spread the seas.
And, as young spring is stealing first kiss from
chill July,
My eyes go roving seaward, where steam the good
ships by.
The Gabo lighthouse marketli—outstanding, high
and lone.
Below it dark Howe ranges; Australia’s corner-
stone,
And North and South, all weathers, around that
Corner go,
The liners and the traders with black smoke trail-
ing low,
Out-funnelled on the skyline, or else a blaze of
light,
To mark them in the offing for watching eyes at
night.
They link me to Far Places ; and though my daily
dreams
Are filled with Nature’s glory, that Link yet
holds, meseems.
What do they now in Melbourne ? How fareth
Sydney town ?
I ask betimes the question, as slow the ships pass
down ;
And tho’ the coast in raiment is robing like a
queen
To greet the Lords of Summer; and tho’ this
land is green
With frequent rain and sunshine, the jungles
dense and lush,
Rich tree fern, thickly drooping, and vine and
berried bush ;
Thro’ all its chords orchestral, that hymn the
works of God,
I hear one clarion calling—a man-made piston
rod !
It trumps the call of distance. Where’er a Rover
bide,
That call will surely loose him, though triple
bound and tied.
It drew men out aforetime, ’twill drive folk out
again,
Who may not, by their firesides, like other folk
remain.
The call was born within them, ’twill draw them
till the dust
Mayhap doth give their spirits a wider wander-
lust;
When, by no earth chains trammelled, their souls
out-wander free
Across the utmost star-tracks, for all Eternity.
I’m swinging in my hammock, and yonder .through
the trees,
I watch the dun procession of engined argosies ;
And yonder, thumping nor’ward a liner of Nippon
Has filled my thoughts with Townsville, from
Somewhere past and gone.
A scent of ripened mangoes, a mad chou-kino
whirl,
The Barrier in the moonlight, hot kisses, and a
gill—
Within me as she blackened the skyline with her
smoke,
The North in all its pulses my heart of mem’ry
woke.
The maize stalks greenly sprouting their richness
from the silt,
A flame tree’s falling petals—like scattered blood
drops spil t ;
A canefield down the Clarence ; a palm tree at
Mackay,
In vision gleamed before me, warm luring, far
away. . . .
A Melbourne trader heading by west around the
Heel
Of all Australia crosses. Now, softer, greyer
steal
My ghosts of recollections ; from lands that lie
between.
The Snowy and the Mallee, the Gulf and River-
ine.
Sure, Collins-street'is pleasing when, peaches and
pearl cream,
The matchless maids of Melbourne in furs and
feathers stream ;
When, like a field of poppies that nod and beck
and wave,
They flutter —flowers of fashion—bedecked, along
its pave.
’Tis pleasant at Fasoli’s to watch the smoke curls
rise;
Talk Art with young Bohemia, and tell the same
old lies
To aspirants of Letters, and when such soul-feasts
cloy,
To frivol at the play-house, or sup at the Savov.
4*
So traileth south my Fancy, and from the Tasman
Sea
The north-bound Riverina another brings to me :
My Citv of Glad Sunshine ! Old Sydney of the
hills,
With vivid brush of magic my mem’ry canvas fills.
Her orange groves and vineyards, that fragrant,
fruiting land
That makes • this jewel’s setting in pleasant
Cumberland.
Gay bathers on the beaches, gray bowlers on the
lawn,
All paths of southern pleasure are in this picture
drawn.
Red tiles of Mosman glowing across the wond’rous
Bay,
Red roses of Old Sydney you draw my heart
away
To that suburban garden where—money in the
purse.
And all out-goings over I’ll sit and write my
verse.
But then —full well I know it —amid its blossoms
fine
Abloom in ordered plottage, for these I’d surely
pine,
The call would surely reach me, the vision rise
again
Of long incurving beaches, and wide out-rolling
Main.
For, ’till no Springtime maddens, till all our hearts
be dust,
The call will come unto us, and answer it we
must . . .
So, swinging in my hammock, I watch those hulls
of steam,
From Lands of Recollection go forth to Lands of
Dream.

E. J. BRADY.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, August 7, 1909.
My Dear Thargojiindah,—
Government House launched out in a musical
party on Friday evening. About 200 attended,
including the Ministry and its aggregate wife; and
the music included three warbles of the first water
by Mrs. Gilbert Wilson (gowned in a Paris con-
fection of clinging old ivory satin and Asiatic
stitchery), some splendid violining by Professor
Toy, and a piano tinkle or so by pretty Elaine
Feez. The vice-regal gown was of cream satin
and gorgeous lace, with an extra-gorgeous whiz of
diamonds and rubies.
I hear that the Naval and Military ball was not
quite the success of yore. A legend has it that
one upon whose shoulders descended the prophetic
mantle of the job of taking the Countess through
an important dance had eaten onions, which got
him into bad repute; and that there were other
mishaps.
The conference of feminine political wisdom
and muddle is almost over, and we have retained
our sanity; but my! it was an effort. We had
five days of papers, discussions and arguments;
and some scratchings and some more than
ordinary cattishness between the two Anti-Sosh
camps of N.S.W.
Proceedings opened with the deputation to the
Premier, mentioned last week. About 50 of the
hair-pinned sex stormed the Chief Secretary s
office ; they marched in to the strain of the inward
melodv, “ There’s nobody here but us ’; and in
just 17 minutes half a dozen of them had talked
the Phidston person, and with him the heavy
Appel, into a state of abject political promise piti-
ful to behold. Then the inroad pinned down its
veil again and glode away per lift. This puts up
an Australian record, I take it, in the deputation
line.
That evening a foregathering took place in the
Albert Hall, and there assembled a sea of femi-
ninity in frills that staggered the beholder. All
that was most worthy was arranged upon the
platform, alongside of such male persqns J as
Phidston, Khi'lp, ex-Speaker Alfred Cowley, tlie
rejected Macartney of Toowong, and sich. The
less worthv and, in consttquence, rnor© attractive
lot sat downstairs, and they, took flashlight
pictures of both lots, the result of which will
probably drive the victims to suicide. The
president made a speech, and so did the
nominal Premier and the real Premier,
and the burden of everybody’s sortg was “ What
on earth would creation have done without
us?” And really one can hardly blame these
anti-Social ist ladies for their exalted aspect and
their pomp and pride when Phidston stood
up and told them right out how much he
would prefer to have them upon the Parlia-
mentary benches rather than the unruly team
which he has to handle.
On Tuesday the real business began, and from
dewy morn to chilly eve those hens sat in the
bleak School of Arts hall and lashed out in verbal
clawings. They demanded an upraising of the
Status of domestic labor (but didn't say how to get
it); the economic independence of the wife and
mother (which demand was made by a spinster,
and supported by other ungathered blooms in
life’s garden); equal work for equal pay (or, at
least, the other way about); more advt. for the
Hempire, and compulsory military training.
Mrs. Bogue Luffman, who somehow reminds me
of a benign tombstone, was in the van and fore-
front of the battle ; and Misses Jenkins, Waugh.
Moseley and Hope lifted up their voices and
wept. The most con vincing talkers of the week
were'Miss Muriel Farr of Adelaide, who, with
pretty eyes and sunnv hair, looks nice enough to
eat; Mrs. Moss, a very rather-too-flowery orator
from Victoria; and Mrs. Mackinnon, a soulful-
looking angel with a recording mind. The Queens-
land ladies on the whole did not shine, saving the
President, whose address was a slap-up affair, and
the meek Margaret, whose bleat was generally
afar off. Ex-Queenslander Grace Watson, in some
most unbecoming clothes and hats, showed more
than ordinary information (and some of the un-
married daughter thereof), and her remarks upon
the new unionism were delivered in a real fighting
strain.
In between the deliverance of these slabs of
philosophy, the delegates had tea once in Dutton
.Park and one© on the s.s. Lucinda, and admired
the river, which is the equivalent of Sydney’s
’Arbor. The concentrated essence of them also
sipped the cheering cup on top of One Tree Hill.
Some strange things happened in the bedding
down of the multitude. Three unappropriated
treasures were comfortably settled in a house in
Leichhardt-street, and were quite happy until
they found that the establishment was a maternity
hospital that was making hay during a slack time
in the baby industry. Now they feel a certain
delicacy in mentioning their address.
There are about ten southern inkslingers among
the multitude. Miss Wheeler (of Melbourne
Argus) twinkles a roving eye and a large, jolly
smile, while at her side lingers a demure shadow-
rejoicing in the name of Bruce. Persons who look
as if they wrote “Gossip.” or these wonderful
letters that are signed “ A Mother of Ten,” also
inhabit the press table.
On closer inspection, I take back what I said
on the subject of hay-rakes and hair-dressing.
Some of the delegates do their top goods quite
nicely, and the remainder —well, they haven t
even got a rake, and like the squirrel's tail of the
Jerome Jerome story, their locks “just go that
way.”
Julius Superbus and Miss Beatrice Day have
been having teas given them. Mrs. Hopkins,
wife of the Moreton regimental commander, fed
them on Friday at a very big spread. The Day
lady blooms, and herewith I take upher banner. She
is a real good Lady Blakeney, Ola Jane notwith-
standing ; and her Mercia is no less Christian and a
good deal more human than that of Mercia Ferrars.
The co. has made a mistake in substituting an

Bowen had its 50th birthday a week or so
back. Port Denison, on which it is built, was
discovered by Captain Sinclair, in' the Santa
Barbara, in 1859. Sinclair settled there, and his
son, D. R. Sinclair, the first white child born in
the place, took part in the recent jubilee celebra-
tions ; as also did Atticus Tooth and Fred Garling,
the only men now living w’ho were among the first
batch of Bowenites.
The Bauanaland electoral rolls shriek
loudly for the readjustment of electoral boun-
daries. Charters Towers (two members) has 9814
electors ; Bulloo (one member) has only 880.
Fortitude Valley (two) has 9036 ; Croydon (one),
931-. Thus sand and saltbush still count instead
of adult human beings, and the keystone of the
democratic arch is cracked in eleven places.


THE GOLDEN MOUNT.
The story of the discovery of Mount Morgan is one
of the most fascinating epics in Australian
history.
The tales of the Arabian Nights’ entertain-
ments are paralleled in the history of
the mine.
Since its discovery in 1882 the great mine has
yielded (to 1907)
THIRTEEN MILLION POUNDS’ WORTH OE
GOLD,
and has paid in dividends in the same period —
SEVEN MILLION POUNDS STERLING.
Besides its gold product, it is the greatest copper
mine in Queensland.
Last year the value of its copper product was
nearly —
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS.
The great mountain top has been levelled, and two
million tons of material shifted and calcined,
or otherwise treated.
The Diamond Drill has established the perma-
nence of its deposits, and some think that, before
its productiveness declines, there will be —
A HUGE CHASM WHERE A MOUNTAIN
STOOD.

THE LURE OF GOLD.—III.
By J. D. Fitz Gerald, Barrister-at-Law.
Mount Morgan, the wonder mine of the-world,
attracts the attention of all by its unique char-
acteristics. To begin with, it is a geological
curiosity which has puzzled the scientists of the
world—“A thermal spring. ... a geyser of
enormous proportions.” This was the currently
received theory of its origin. “ A hill of gold.”. .
it undoubtedly was. and it stood among other
hills, with grassy flat lands between, forming
part of Gordon’s Calliungal Station, 25 miles from
Rockhampton. , It has already been noted that
the whole of this district was proved to
be gold-bearing, the unfortunate Canoona
rush being to the north, with Carwarral and
Calliope near by. The brothers Gordon had
noticed metalliferous boulders on the hill; and had
prospected in a small way. Then came the actual

discoverer of the mine, Ned Morgan, who, with
one of the Gordons (the other having taken cattle
away during a drought period on the station)
camped on the property and made the sensational
discovery of gold-bearing stone. In the prospect-
ing he was assisted by Tom Morgan, his brother,
and Sandy Gordon, brother of the owner of
Calliungral. The value of the mine was proved by
assays of the stone at Gytnpie, the return being
3700 ounces to the ton. Messrs. Darcy, Hall, Pat-
terson and others were let into this wondrous secret,
a company was formed, machinery
and the mine was launched on the world. From
it was known as a mine until the end of
1907, 3,26G.4990z. of gold, to say nothing of the
copper lately worked, had been taken from it, with
a value of £13,005,990. The dramatic significance
of the position of the Gordons has been dealt with
in a poem by Brim ton. Stephens. In this,
although in a head note the poet makes the /ocvs
in quo a tin mine, he clearly refers to Mount
Morgan. He calls the poem “The Lost Chance.”
These are a few of the lines :
Just to miss it by a hair-breadth—nay, not miss it! To
have held it
In my hand, and oft times through my fingers ran the
swarthy ore,
Minus only the poor trick of art or science that com-
pelled it
To unveil for others’ grod the hidden value, and to poor
On a thousand hearts the light of hope that shines for
me no more.
To have held it in my hand in vacant listlessiiefes of i
wonder,
Taken with its dusky lustre, all incurious of its worth.
To have trod foryearsupon it—l above, the fmtiinemfili v !
To have scattered it a thousand times like seed upon
the earth !
Who shall say I am not justified who curse my dav of
birth?
To have built my hovel o’er it; to have dreamed above it
nightly,
Pillowed on the weal of thousand lives, and dead unto
my own
Planting- paltry profits wrung from year-long toil and
holding lightly
What lay acres wide around me,' naked, brigdit or
grass o’ergrown ;
Holding lightly, and for that I curse—nay, not myself
alone.
For I hold it cruel mockery in man, or God or Devil
To assign the boor his blindfold lot from’weary dav to
day.
In the very lap of affluence, on Fortune’s hi<diest level
Then upon the brink of revelation trick his steps away
And flash the truth upon him when his chance has < r one
for aye.
*•
From this hill the top has been torn off by the
aid of litanic machinery. Great crevasses have
been cut m the solid mountain, and slice after
slice of the hillside has been scooped away. Before
the revelation of this scooping process the pictu-
resque theory of the hrst geologist, Dr. Jack, faded
away. The latest word on the subject eomesfrom
Mr. Bowie Wilson, who. after eight years’ connec-
tion with the working of the mine, declares that.
a^k°u ffk ie fl e y ser theory has been abandoned

and others substituted, “ there are still several
features about the deposit for a satisfactory ex-
planation of which lam at loss.” So the geological
origin of the mine is still a mystery. It is almost
a pity that we cannot admit the fanciful idea of a
magnificent geyser spouting gold in solution—a
geyser whose Spurts and jets would cause all
others, even the great and mysterious Waimangu
of Maoriland, to hide their diminished heads.
The destruction of this theory deprives us of that
fascinating, elusive pursuit of trying to re-create
in a mental picture, some of the features
of our great pre-historic past—when strange
monsters moved weirdly in a mist, caused by a
tremendous jet of boiling water, which from time
to time spurted Heaven-high, coming back in a
cauldron of spray and steam, its rainbows trans-
muted to gold. Nothing in the Arabian Nights’
entertainments would have been more novel to the

imagination than the idea of that great geyser,
spouting waters impregnated with gold for aeons
and aeons; till, exhausted, it subsided into its
caves, leaving the hill saturated with gold, waiting
for the chance discovery of the Morgans, and the
pitiful tragedy of the men who missed by a hair-
breadth wealth beyond the dreams of avarice.
he vicissitudes of the great mine, from the
imeot its hrst exploitation, will some day make an
epic story or poem. Within a short time of the
rea isation of its greatness, it was floated on the
puone market m Queensland for a m illion sterling,
uater flotations at five and even seven times that
amount were projected ; but they did not come to
anything. It was such an amazing tiling, this
hill of gold, this wonder mine, that reason
and common-sense seemed to leave men who,
in the ordinary transactions of a work-a-day
world, were shrewd and hard-headed. There was
no limit to the value placed upon it by the enthu-
siasts. It was so rich that they imagined it must
be richer. On the share values as quoted in the
stock exchange, and on the actual sale transac-
tions it was estimated to be worth £17,000,000.
There was a rumor of one prominent shareholder
having made a large wager that shares, then at
£l7 odd, would reach £2O.
The town of Rockhampton, a few miles from
the mine, was the centre of the fever zone. The
town itself became infected. It is said that men
who had bought in at £1 per share and had sold
out at £l4 per share, thereby becoming wealthy,
were carried off their feet by tHe great magnate’s
wager, and bought in again at £l7 per share,
hoping to earn another fortune by the rise to £2O.
When the slump came shares fell to £2, and these
venturesomegamblerswereruined. Thewholetown
—the flourishing town of Rockhampton, to-day one
of the most thriving in the State of Queensland—
was stunned and cast down. Stagnation followed.
As the town nearest to the mine, it had to with-
stand the first concussion caused by the bursting
of the boom. _Yet there was the wonder mine"
still the richest in the Commonwealth ; its hill
not then levelled, its cliffs not then-razed, and all
the gold and copper which has been found siucestill
waiting to yield to the insistent knocks of the
miner’s pick, and later, to the scrunch of the great
steam shovels, and the vibration of the com-
pressed air-drills. Yet the town was almost
ruined. But the shock brought the people to their
senses. There was a sobering up throughout the
State; and Queensland has built up much of her
subsequent success on the bitter experience which
she gained in this crisis.
The “gold fallacy” was abroad. The people
imagined that Mount Morgans existed every-
where. The early geological enthusiast declared
that almost any hill might be another “silicious
sinter.” As the thing has worked out to-day,
mining goes hand in hand with other productive
industries. The idea that gold is everything and
that so long as plenty is forthcoming from rich
mines there is no need for other forms of produc-
tion, has long: been exploded in Queensland as
effectually as it was in Spain, where the stoppage
of internal production followed the importation
of the “treasures of the Incas” from South
America. The ignorance which caused the land-
owner to overlook the magnificent fortune lying
at his feet has passed away. Education and the
State agencies established to assist the settler
make it almost impossible for such a thing to
happen again. The farmer of to-day is an amateur
geologist, and if he finds any substance which
appears to be metalliferous he despatches it to
the Government Assay Department, and gets
his report in due time for the cost of a few
shillings.
The slump of the Mount Morgan boom turned
back the eyes of those who were gold-mad
to the possibilities of other sources of wealth in
the soil besides gold. To-day the development
of every source of wealth goes on simultaneously.
In most of the present mining fields the huge gold
product has been made possible by the investment
of a large amount of capital, drawn from other
sources. And it is a curious commentary that,
as the possibilities of wealth from the soil by what
might be described as the “ surer ” avenues—such
as agricultural and pastoral pursuits—are proved,
there has been a diminution of the volume of
capital annually invested in mining, and, conse-
quently, a slightly reduced return of gold pro-
duction. But this does not apply to Mount
Morgan. It is curious to inquire and find that
the year of the slump in Mount Morgan
showed the larsrest gold return from the mine
ever received before or since, viz., 314,3560 z.,
value £1,257,424 ; and, since that year, £10,600,000
worth of gold has been won, in addition to the
return from copper, which in 1907 was valued at
£385.705.
This tendency to invest in the surer avenues
described above will lead to a day, not far distant,
when those who have made a competence in their

farming or pastoral avocations will have money
to speculate with, and again the hour of rapid
development in the mines will come. The induce-
ment to foreign capital to come Queenslandwards
for investment in mining channels depends upon
circumstances beyond our control, so far as the
fluctuating commercial metals are concerned —
copper, tin, etc. But gold is not subject to such
fluctuations. Nothing that has occurred in the
past few years has disturbed the wonderful pro-
gress of production in the golden mount.
Mr. A. R. Macdonald, Under-Secretary for
Mines, in his report to the then Secretary for
Mines (the Hon. J. VV. Blair) in 1907, says some-
thing which gives an idea of the marvellous
productive capacity of the mount to-day :
The pre-eminence of Mount Morgan lias so long been
accepted as a matter of course that few persons except
those directly interested have any just conception < f the
magnitude of its operations or of its value to the .State.
Last year the mine pr sluced gold and copper valued at
(E 1,000,1-24 ; paid in dividends £237,500; and besides
applying £50,00 l to the formation of a reserve fund and
£30,000 to the erection of an insurance fund, paid in
wages a sum considerably exceeding £300,000 ; in dues to
the Government more than £60,000 ; in other directions a
quarter of a million, and supported a population of 12,000
souls, irrespective of such rising dependencies as Marmor,
Iron Island, and Many Peaks.
The Golden Mount, thep, is one of the land-
marks of Queensland’s prosperity. Its perma-
nence is assured ; and this we know, not by clair-
voyance or guesswork, but by the tests of the
diamond drill, which has pr-obed the mountain to
its roots, and has established the great
masses of ore which, as time goes oh. wilf'be I aid-
bare. The power of men and machinery has been
shown in the removal of some 360 ft. of the moun-
tain’s top, and the treatment of two million tons of
material. At the Mount one finds the very latest
machinery and appliances ; the very latest dis-
coveries in metallurgy are applied to the winning
of the gold ; a lnrge staff of chemists, assayers,
I metallurgists and skilled men of varied occu-
pations is kept to devise the best means of
cheapening the processes and making the pro-
ductive power of the mine greater than it is.
From this central industry avenues of prosperity
radiate outwards. This prosperous community,
permanent in its character, at least for many
years to come, is an employer of farmers, dairy-
men, graziers and primary producers generally.
Its golden products circulate in the veins of the
commercial life of the whole State. It is a source
of direct or indirect benefit to every citizen who
throws in his lot with the Queenslanders ; and it
is a factor which must not be overlooked by the
emigrant when he is making up his mind to share
the fortunes, of the inhabitants of the rich, but
comparatively untenanted, Northern State

Dr. Marshall, Medical Officer of the Expedition, states,

For those undergoing physical or mental strain no food can equal Plasmon.

medicine. . . Failing to get more than temporary relief from this they then
consult a doctor, and he writes a prescription which more than likely calls for the

llie same result, generally. Next, the patient comes to the conclusion that this
doctor didn’t diagnose the case right, and then goes to another, with the same

“ Harness Cask ” writes :
The Italian barque Erminia, which some people were
beginning to think would never drop anchor in any
port again, dawdled into Port Phillip on the 141st
day of its voyage, and was immediately seized and
dragged impatiently up to a Williamstown berth by
something- called the Alacrity. The Erminia’s stroll
from Marseilles began on February 22, and most of the
liru erve lV n £> . e | llont hs it was the joke of the elements.
When the wind wasn’t absent without leave, it was
at home in a drunk and disorderly state of
mind ; consequently the Erminia was either sitting
motionless on the sea, or being rolled violently
about, and washed all over without being dried.
Generally speaking, the barque experienced the same
sort of time as a baby left in charge of a female lunatic.
The sailing ship finds it difficult to get a cargo nowadays :
and when you consider what a haphazard thing the
sailing-ship- voyage is, and how Time scoots over the
horizon whilst the mariner is struggling to harness the
kicking hurricane with a handful of hemp, the reluctance
of the merchant to enter his bale of calico for the buck-
jumping competition doesn’t seem unreasonable. With
cheap steam carriage available, the gradual and riskv
windjammer must rust more than ever at its moorings.
It is about as out-of-date as Freetrade and antimacassars.
“Splug (Melb.): In the interests of dere-
lict blokes, I want to protest against the over-
free use of that word “parasites.” It has got to
be fashionable in Melbourne. Two politicians,
Grouch and Coon (what a pair of names to travel
together) went to Geelong and called Labor
members ‘parasites.” Parson Worrall at Ben-
digo talked about “ parasites ” in the gold mines
—a horror added to miner’s complaint. The Age
or A.rgus (I forget which) wrote a leading article
0,1 khe Press Gabble in London, saying how noble
the Great were, and ’ow ’orrible the
parasite rags were. I don’t like to see this
n , a ' s , t y word so often. It is painful to the feelings
of blokes who have to live in Melbourne doss-
houses.
Lieutenant E. H. Shaokleton, R.N., in testify-
i?™-* 0 e J ce H e,lce .°f Plasmon preparations, states :
We used them continually during the National Antarctic
Expedition, and the Plasmon Powder was one of the
principal items of food on the southern sledge journ y in
which Captain Scott. Dr. Wilson, and myself made'the
world s record for further south. Another sledging party

Expedition, he mentions as follows “ Our food con-
sisted of pemmican, biscuit, cheese, chocolate, suifnr
Plasmon and meat/’ Dr. Marshall, Medical Officer of the
Expedition, relates in same paper:—“At times thev were
reduced to pemmican meat and three to four biscuits
daily, Plasmon biscuits and cocoa were of tremendous
value. *

The SAFETY CORN PLANE
THE ONLY SAFE CURE FOR CORNS
Guaranteed absolutely reliable and free from danger. Only 2/2 post free
The SAFETY CORN PLANE differs
from all so-called Corn Eradicators,
inasmuch as it performs the functions
.of a "Plane,” and. therefore, cannot
draw blood. It gives thorough, safe,
and instantaneous relief to those who suffer from Corns. It does away with ali dangers and draw-
backs of Corn Knives, Razors. Files. Plasters,and Chemical Corn Cures on the market. It can be used
by everyone, without risk of drawing blood or fear of Blood-ooisoning, and takes the Corn clean away
without causing pain. For planing off old hard skin on the heels or soles of the feet it has no equal.
Where the Corns exist underneath the feet, we advise using in conjunction with the Safety Corn
Plane our Dr. Hogyes’ Asbestos Soles, price 1/2 and 2/2 per pair, post free. Plane the Corn to the level
of the skin, and as you thus remove all irritation the Corn will soon entirely disappear, especially if
you wear the Asbestos Soles inside the boot or shoe as well.
The directions for using the Safety Corn Plane are very simple. Simply draw the Plane quickly
from all directions over the Corn, and it will come off in fine flakes In a few seconds the Plane
refuses to catch, but examination will shew the Corn is gone. If the Corn reappears, repeat the
process until it is entirely cured. The Safety Corn Plane positively will not cut the skin. The blade,
which is made of razor s'reel and highly tempered, can he removed and re-sharpened, and can also be
adjusted, if desired, in the same manner as a carpenter’s plane. It is better to use the Safety Corn
Plane before bathing the feet, because the harder the Corn the better the result. 2 12 each post free.

The South-street society of Ballarat (Vic.),
which was probably the inventor of the musical
(etc.) competition disease, celebrated its thirtieth
birthday last month. It was in July. 1879, that
a band of misguided enthusiasts founded the
society, and encouraged that orgy of “Nelly Blv”
music and “Little Jim” elocution that has
turned peaceful homes into dens of din. These
pioneers of “The Boy Stood on the Burning
Deck ” began their horrible operations in a small
hall (40ft. by 30ft.) in South-street, and gave their
first exhibition in 1884. A. Deakin, then Victoria’s
Chief Secretary, was present and applausive.
Two years later the society, flourishing under
much public excitement, shifted to Skipton-street,
where a large hall was built at a cost of £12,000.
A. Deakin again appeared to open the hall, and, in
1890, the first of the present competitions was held.
Then there were only 250 entries for £5O worth of
prizes. Last year there were 5000 entries, and
the gifts to musical and other miscreants aggre-
gated over £lOOO. And the name of the affair
should be the Brig-Creating Society.
Messrs. Baker and Rouse, Australasian selling
agents for the big Yankee concern, the Eastman Kodak
Co., have just received word that the long-looked-for,
non-inflammable cinematograph film is not only an estab-
lished fact but on the market. As most people know, the
ordinary celluloid film is composed of very much thesame
materials as gun cotton, and the liability to fire has been
the bugbear of the operator. Although, so far, there
have been very few explosions, some of those that have
eventuated have been serious enough. With the new film
such a disaster is just impossible. If placed in the fire
the new film burns unwillingly and without flame, much
as brown paper does. The experiments that resulted in
its development extended over several years, and the
placing of it on the market involved the erection of anew
factory and plant, costing about £30,000. Altogether
about £lOO,OOO has been expended in its evolution.*
An unburied dead dog that died not too
recently at Neutral Bay (Sydney) is an awful
instance of civic misgovernment; therefore it pro-
vides a good, if unpleasant, argument why the 42
councils should be abolished and the control of the
city given over to one central authority with a
prompt dustman. It appears that, when the
animal expired, it neglected to fall exactly on the
public highway. It may have struggled to reach
the highway ; but there is no certainty about it.
Its dead body was found on private land a few
inches out of the local council’s sphere of disinfect-
ant. The afflicted ratepayer, being without the
proper facilities for removing dead dogs, besought
the council officials to bear it to the tomb; the
officials calmly replied that “the Government
would have to be approached.” The ratepayer
either hadn’t the time, or else he shrank from the
job of approaching G. Wade, dragging the corpse
by the tail. Anyhow, the thing was still above
ground one calendar week after he had implored,
and been refused, the loan of the council’s dust-
cart. It is a tale of simple savagery which seems
almost too dreadful to be true —until you remem-
ber the manners and customs of the average aider-
man, and how he speaks to his colleagues when
they are gathered round the council table. The
usual proceedings of the usual council frequently
consist of this sort of thing. (The cutting is a few
months old, and w’as preserved by a Bulletin
scribe as a good specimen of aldermania) :
To a proposal that the Mayor should at once spend the
money Alderman B. raised a strong objection.
Alderman A. : You’re talking nonsense.
Alderman B. : It’s like your impudence to interrupt.
Alderman A. : Rot.
Alderman B. : I can’t help your ignorance. Shut up.
Alderman A. : Shut up yourself. You have no brains.
Alderman B. : And you have no hair.
Alderman A. : A man cannot have both brains and hair.
Alderman B. : Nobody else can have any brains if you
have in the Council. But I suppose they’re in your toes.
The logical climax to a verbal duel of that descrip-
tion is the flinging around of a deceased animal
like the Dead Dog of Neutral Bay. The ordinary
council begins with Dead Dog, and its eloquence
is of the Dead Dog variety. A real, ripe Dead
Dog, fjorcibly introduced into the proceedings,
would bound things off beautifully, and this paper
eannotj understand why the Neutral Bay corpse
hasn’t jbeen cold storaged by some council for
future |use. It seems a shocking waste of good
debating ammunition.
The Motor Construction Department, created
some years ago by the Mort’s Dock & Engineering Co.,
Sydney, has grown steadily in spite of the cut-throat
opposition of the foreigner, and has now reached a stage
when it feels strong enough to carry the war into the
enemy’s territory. Therefore a new company has been
formed to take over the business and push it for all it
is worth. Plans are in hand for a big increase in the
output and a drastic cut in price, with a view to attack-
ing the foreigner where he lives.*
Victoria has struck something rare m the
way of aspersion upon the white race. A Chinese
doctor, aged 35, is suing for a divorce from his
white girl-wife (she is aged 21, and they have been
married two years), on the allegation that she has
“gone wrong” with a Chinese cabinet-maker and
a Chow in the clothes-washing line.
SURCEASE.

S.A.
A grey day 7, and greyer rain,
And my last day of pain !
Soon they will come and carry' me
To the little white room, where I shall lie
On a smooth table, cool to touch,
And feel my' life slip slowly by,
Not caring very much.
And, if I. . . sleep, or wake again.
It will be without pain !

“The President ” orates a little :
I hate the dull noises made by the political soothsayers,
medicine-men and witch-doctors who pretend to know
the things which the framers of the Australian Constitu-
tion “ contemplated,” but, strangely enough, did not
incorporate in that document. I hate the fakirs (1) for
their own obnoxious sake ; and (2) because they remind
me of a man who, for purposes of concealment, I will
call Bodger. Bodger was the oldest surviving member of
a small literary and debating society into which I was
thrust at a tender age by several well-meaning relatives
who should have known better, but didn’t. Our society
was a shambling affair in most respects ; the members al-
ways arrived late and unprepared—or forgot to arrive at
all; the subscriptions were never paid ; and the chair-
man generally had to borrow a syllabus to find
out what the business of the evening was. As
regards the first objects of the society, we were
about as far advanced as an aboriginal camp ; but we
had a reverence and admiration for points of order that
almost amounted to lunacy. Unfortunately the elaborate
constitution of the society had been lost years before, and,
as all the original founders had long since departed, we
were generally in a pitiable state of doubt as to the
proper form of procedure. This is where the dull and
otherwise objectionable Bodger comes into the plot.
Bodger had been the earliest and about the most obscure
member of the society ; he had said “Hear, hear,” in the
back row at the first dimly-lit meetings, and there was a
tradition that he had seen with his own eyes the exercise-
book in which the Constitution was written ! So Bodger
was cherished and deferred to by us poor, convention-
bound savages, and, when a knotty point cropped up, we
used to beg' him to try and remember what the Con-
stitution had said on that point; or, in lieu thereof, what
the vanished founders had “contemplated.” Bodger,
after a certain amount of entreaty had been squandered
on him, would stand up clumsily, fix his eyes on the
dirty ceiling, and project himself mentally into the past-
or as far in that direction as he could get. That wretched
society never flourished on account of the strange and
awful complexities “ contemplated ” by the founders—as
revealed by Bodger in his trance interpretations of the
lost Constitution. He was the first “contemplation”
medium I ever met, and his influence amounted to a
permanent blight. The society was afflicted with Bodger,
it suffered severely from Bodger, and it died a lingering
death of Bodger. I thought the disease of Bodger dis-
appeared from the earth when our society died. But it
didn’t! Australia has it now.

Winter Dangers which are harmless if properly treated with
DR. SHELDON’S NEW DISCOVERY.
At this season of the year, when nearly everyone is troubled more or less with Bronchial
or ulmonary affections, it behoves one to use every care that these do not develop into the
acute stage which is dangerous to life. Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery is a remedy which can
oe relied upon implicitly by all as a preventative and positive cure for all diseases of the
J. nroat, uhest and Lungs. It cures coughs and colds by relieving the congestion and in-
narnmation, and by removing the cause of nervous debility, which is always the primary
origin of diseases of this nature. Used as directed, it will at once reach the seat of the
disease, and, by its specific action upon the secretions, will bring the whole system under its
influence, and speedily effect a cure. It should always be promptly and regularly used when-
ever a cold is contracted, and in all coughs due to neglected colds or disorders of the Lungs
or Bronchial Tubes.
Ihis New Discovery is based on the most modern and scientific principles known to the
ad vanced science of medicine, and, being cognisant of its wonderful properties, we are giving

Gentlemen,
These few lines are to express my great gratitude
and admiration for Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery.
Like most English people, I imagined one never
caught colds in Australia, therefore last Saturday, when
my singing voice became a trifle husky, I took little if any
notice, thinking my Sunday’s rest would put me right ;
but it did not do so, and - by evening I could scarcely
speak, and was afraid a thoroughly bad cold was com-
mencing. However, a friend here gave me a bottle of
your medicine. I went right away to bed, and took a
couple of doses during the evening and one in the early
morn, as my cough was troublesome, and by Monday I
sang my three songs better by far than I do as a rule, and
the public evidently thought so too, as they were more
than usually sympathetic. I wish Dr. Sheldon’s New
Discovery more than success, and 1 can honestly assure
you I will recommend it to all my friends.
Yours very truly,
GRACIE GRAHAME.

On FARM, SHEEP-RUN
and CATTLE-STATION
Zam-Buk is Invaluable.
The true value of Zam-Buk is nowhere
more readily recognised and highly
appreciated than among the busy toilers
on farms, sheep and cattle stations and
outback selections,
where the workers—
who are, as a rule,
fifty, one-hundred or
t w o-h und r e d-miles from
medical assistance—need a
balm with soothing and
healing properties, combined
with the power of cleansing
and “sweetening” wounds,
and preventing “ gathering,”
festering, inflammation,
poisoning and disease, such
as Zam-Buk ONIrY is.
It may be at the plough; in the workshop; while splitting, fencing,
branding, or shearing ;or in the homestead itself—the hands receive nasty
cuts and burns, and the body and legs painful bruises and abrasions, which
require the immediate soothing, healing, antiseptic and germicidal powers
of Zam-Buk to prevent any tendency to festering or poisoning, and ensure
prompt and perfect healing, thus enabling the worker to continue his
work without inconvenience, or loss of time and money.
Ex-Station-Manager’s Praise.
Mr. W. G-. Paine, ex-manager of Wandovale Cattle-station, Queensland, and now
residing at Baker Street, Charters Towers, (Q.), has proved the value of Zam-Buk— and
incidentally the wisdom of always having a pot handy—for a deep wound caused through
being horned by a bull, and writes “ Some two years ago I was manager on Wandovale
Cattle-station, and I found Zam-Buk invaluable for many kinds of injuries sustained
during my occupation. On one occasion I was horned in the leg by a bull, the flesh being torn open
and Causing a nasty wound. We fortunately had some Zam-Buk in the homestead, and I immediately
applied a dressing of the balm, and within a week the wound had healed right up.
“ At another time I got a half-hitch around my hand with a head-rope while branding calves, and
the strain broke the bone in one of my fingers, and splintered another. I was 120 miles from the
nearest doctor, so thought I would again try Zam-Buk. I used to rub the balm in every night, and
although I worked all day, in three months my fingers were quite knit and healed. I intend never to
be without a pot of Zam-Buk handy for use when occasion may arise.”
The home that always keeps a pot of Zam-Buk handy is furnished with an ever-ready
healer and perfect skin-cure, and with the one reliable remedy for winter eczema, any
scalp sores suddenly appearing among the children, the obstinate piles and bad legs of the
worker, festering and swelling from blood-poisoning, and any burning, irritating and
itching sores, which are
among the daily perils
of this season. Zam-Buk
is obtainable from all
chemists and stores,
1/6 and 3/6 per pot.
EVERY HOME
NEEDS ZAM-BUK.

An Appeal to Women.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There were three bodies associated with the present
partVj including the Women’s National League. It was a
singular thing that men who were so bitterly opposed to
women suffrage should have to go to a women’s meeting
to get a platform. (Opposition cheers.) Perhaps it was
because they found the ladies less liable to argue and ask
them questions. (Laughter.) He did not know why
they should inflict awful nights of torture upon their lady
friends. (Loud laughter and cheers.)— Wise, M.H.li.
OYE women! wihmin ! WEEMIN ! !
See our tears repentant streamin’ !
See the pearly drops a-gleamin’,
Streamin’ from our rheumy eye !
Mark our weskits palpitatin’.
Pray ye, be accommodatin’.
Spare a thought commiseratin’ .
Say the Tory shall not die t
Spare him, who has been your master,
From political disaster.
Doom approaches fast and faster.
Save him—and the Marriage Tie !
Long ago, when, in the gloaming,
Hungry mastodons went roaming
With a view to seeking out what they might scoff,
There was little chance for spooning
In the park ; and honey-mooning,
As a fashion, was most obviously “off.”
For a honeymoon’s a failure, and the gladness of
it’s gone
tf you spend the latter end of it inside a mastodon.
So the troglodyte, new-married,
Cut his honeymoon, and tarried
In his cavern with his little bit of frock ;
And, instead of hugs and kisses,
He caressed his lawful missus
With a bit of cold, hard tertiary rock,
lor the “proper sphere” for women in that
neolithic race
Was amongst the goods and chattels, and she had
to keep her place.
But, as troglodytes expanded,
Rose a section that demanded
More consideration for the women-folk ;
And the good old Tory faction
Met, and moved to “take some action
To oppose this foolish Socialistic joke.
But they had a way of dealing with such people
in those days ;
And, therefore, rocks gave way to clubs and other
gentler ways.
Hark, 0, woman! woman ! WOOMAN !!
You would not be so inhuman
As to seal the Tory’s doom an’
Join the Socialistic hordes ?
0, ye women of the classes !
Rise ye in your cultured masses 1
Haste, before the Tory passes.
Be ye saviors of your lords.
Lo, have we not fought your battles ?
(Hark ! The foeman’s armor rattles !)
Would ye be his toys and chattels i
Save us from Progression s swords !
Passing down the ancient ages.
Skipping many pregnant pages,
We arrive at that old magnate of the mines—
Solomon, in all his glory—
Rich monopolist and Tory,
Who possessed some wives and countless concu-
bines.
And I shall not pause to dwell upon the Queen of
Sheba’s visit;
For such gossip isn’t tolerated ’midst the
“ naicest,” is it ?
After that wise king was pensioned,
Someone (who and when not mentioned)
Said that men should have no more than one wife
each.
Then the good old crusted Tory
Rose, with language loud and gory,
And delivered a prolonged impassioned speech.
He called this new proposal “Socialistic froth
and foam
That attacked the marriage contract and the
sanctity of home.”
Ay, he raved with indignation,
Formed an ancient Federation
Of Defence, and backed it up with piles of cash.
But the rabid “ One-wife ” section
Fought and carried the election,
And their legislation ill-advised and rash.
Old Time has sprinted somewhat since that
scheme was first begun,
And now the Tory (I’m informed) is satisfied with
one.
O, ye ivomen! wimmin ! WEEMIN ! !
Don’t ye hear the Tory screamin’ ?
All along lie’s been esteemin’
Womankind, since ages dim.
He has pampered you and prized you ;
E’er adored and idolised you,
And, moreover, recognised you
As his equal. Fly to him !
Has he not passed legislation
Granting you emancipation ?
If you’d save your reputation
Haste to grant his ev’ry ivhim !
Once again, with hasty fingers,
Let us turn the page. Who lingers
There will find that ancient history repeats,
O’er and o’er the same old story,
Telling how the dear old Tory
Abdicates (perhaps) when womankind entreats.
Well, he did admit her equal to his dog at any
rate.
So we’ll pass—with your permission— to affairs of
recent date.
Ah ! did not the tender Tory
Listen to her tearful story
When she pleaded for a vote a while ago 0
Did he not cry out in anguish
To behold his sister languish
For the franchise that the men enjoyed ! Oh no.
’Tis recorded—mayhap wrongly—that he fought
her tooth and nail.
And he sneered at her pretensions, but Jiis sneers
did not prevail.
Does the Tory change? I doubt it.
Watch him, how he goes about it,
Like his prototype the troglodyte 8.C.,
When her mood he wants to soften,
See him smite her hard and often
With large, heavy chunks of deadly orat’ry.
But the outlook of she-troglodytes has much
improved to-day;
For, although they may not know it, they’re his
last and only stay.
Hark ye, women! Women voters /
Social queens and League promoters !
Are ye ever to be doters
On the male-bird of your type?
Since Tory Adam bit the pippin
He has blamed you for his slippiri
And his sinnin . Here’s a rippin’
Chance to pay back ev’ry stripe.
Nay. it were a shame to lose it.
You have got the franchise—use it!
Hk said that you would abuse it.
Now! Thumbs down ! The time is ripe!

The Cocky’s Natural Enemies.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BESIDES droughts, floods, and periodic
bush fires, the cocky on wayback creeks
has a multitude of natural enemies to do
battle with. In fact, his life is one continual
warfare against some pest or other. He goes on
the land with a stout heart, and talks enthusias-
tically of its boundless resources and its wealth
of timber, and he traces with pride the windings
of the sinuous scrub-fringed watercourse that
forms his frontage. He builds a small hut, and
his wife commences housekeeping in a humble
way, and with great hopes of a marvellous man-
sion in the future. A wire fence creeps round
the selection, and a “cultivation” is enclosed,
with a dog-leg fence across a bight in the creek.
A few fowls and pigs, a small herd of cows, a
flock of sheep, and two or three horses are intro-
duced, and the young couple’s dreams of bacon
and eggs, fresh milk and butter are realised. The
little settlement that is to produce wealth and
happiness is at last a going concern.
But at the very outset the long struggle for
existence commences. The cocky meets his
myriad foes determinedly, ever with the grim
Darwinian philosophy on his lips that the fittest
will survive. No sooner do his hens begin to
lay than crows, swamp pheasants, jackasses and
gohannas raid his nests. Crows and hawks carry
off his chickens. His roosts are nightly visited by
native cats and carpet snakes. The fowls are
usually accommodated at the start with nothing
more than a ladder leaning against the limb of a
tree, and later, with a small bark or slab shed. I
can recall many exciting experiences in connec-
tion with these places. A frantic squawk some
time in the night would be the signal to light up
the slush lamp, and armed with this and a waddy
we would hurry to the scene of disturbance.
Sometimes the marauder was a native cat,
triumphantly staggering towards the doorway
with a hen by the neck. In that case one would
remain at the door with the lamp, and then would
follow an exciting chase round the walls until the
animal was captured, or broke through the door-
guard and escaped. At other times the long,
sinuous coils of a carpet snake on the roosts would
confront us. These were ugly brutes to deal with
if they got on the ground, for the old slush-lamp
threw more shadow than light, and when there
was a light wind and the snake really exerted him-
self to escape, it was worse than no light at all.
What makes the carpet snake more destructive
than a dozen hawks is the fact that he can steal
up to a hen as she sits over her brood of chicks,
and, thrusting his head under her, swallow
chicken after chicken, probably half the clutch,
before being discovered by the mother. The
carpet snake, however, is not without good
points. In mice- or rat-haunted houses he is
to be recommended before the family cat. He is
easily tamed, and there are bushmen who keep
him' expressly as a pet.
The white hawk and the common brown kite
hawk are the worst daylight robbers of the chicken
yard ; though the crow and the jackass (in certain
districts) are almost as bad. It is considered by
many as little short of sacrilege to accuse Jack of
chicken-killing ; but let him once taste chicken
and he will be a pest to reckon with. It is com-
mon to see him clinging to a limb with the head
of a chick in his mouth, and another Jack hang-
ing to the bird’s legs and swinging underneath.
Others perch alongside, watching the tug-of-war,
occasionally venting a loud laugh, probably by
way of encouraging the contestants, or with the
desire to provoke angry remarks that will cause
the dinner to be dropped.
Crows, again, severely harass the selector’s
sheep, clinging to the necks of the poverty-
stricken ewes, and pecking out their eyes in spite
of all efforts to shake them off. The wedge-tail
eagle lifts the young lambs as easily as the kite
lifts a mouse. Another raider of the sheep-flock
is the fox. that latest pest which brings curses on
the fool Englander who wanted the stink to re-
mind him of home. The fox is a more formidable
enemy than the dingo ; for, whereas the latter
will eat his fill off one sheep, the former has been
known to kill a dozen in one night, eating only
the tongues and kidneys.
From numerous yarns told by early settlers,
young. Australia deduced that the fox was a
humorous blackguard who prowled about the
hen-roosts at night, and occasionally afforded
magnificent sport to huntsmen and hounds. He
who won the brush was regarded as a hero, and
was hailed with a blast of trumpets or something.
Proudly he bore the extremity home, and prouder
still was the belle to whom the pink-coated sport
presented the trophy. But there is no glorious
death for Reynard in Australia. He is poisoned,
shot, logged, trapped, ambushed, and dynamited!
The most expeditious method is employed to com-
pass his death, and the “ trophy ” is taken at once
to the nearest scalp-receiver. He does not exhibit
anything like the cunning with which he is
credited in the land of his nativity. Bushmen

THE BATTLE OF LIFE.
Efficiency Depends upon Health. Health Depends upon the Kidneys. -
Every man or woman who works must keep healthy, if work is to be done efficiently. The unfit go to the wall. Good
work depends upon good health. Work becomes a nightmare to those who are not well. ARM YOU EFFICIENT?
Or are you Depressed, Tired, Suffering from Broken Sleep, Backache, Pains in the Limbs, Bad Taste in. the Mouth? All
these are symptoms that your kidneys are weak or diseased, and unable to carry out their work of filtering the blood and
keeping it pure. The Kidneys are the Filters of Life. All these
symptoms are forerunners of Dropsy, Rheumatism, Urinary
Diseases, Gravel, Stone, Neuralgia, all of which are Kidney
Diseases. Only a kidney medicine can cure you. Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills act on the kidneys, and on the kidneys only. They
will keep you bright, free from pain, backache and headache.
They will keep you efficient.
LASTING SYDNEY CURE.
Mr. John Loaney, 20 Swanson Street, Erskineville, Sydney, states “ I wish to give you particu-
lars of my experience with Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. I owe these pills a debt of gratitude, for
they have cured me of verv serious kidney diseases. My ill-health commenced three years ago, when I
first had to lay up. I had"terrible pains in my back and right side, and my secretions scalded, and were
thick and contained sedimentary matter. I also had fits of giddiness, and every day I would have a
violent headache. For two years I spent an average of two weeks out of every three in bed, and even
when up I was very ill. I had the best medical advice and treatment to be procured ; ten leading Sydney
physicians treated mein the three years of my illness ; their bills totalled £lBO. The general idea was
that I suffered with stone in the kidneys, and I was constantly advised to undergo an operation. At last
a specialist put me under the X rays. He told me that it was unnecessary to be operated on, as my
kidneys were too far gone for an operation tofhenefit me. I gave up all hope of recovery, and fully
expected to die soon, and my friends were of the same opinion. My lawyer was brought home, and made
out my will; I was held up to sign it. Not long after this I was advised to use Doan s Backache Kidney
Pills. The man who urged me to give this remedy "a trial had been cured by it, and had the utmost faith
in its healing properties. He told me he had been doubled up with the ailment, and not able to get
about at all, and one box had cured him, and for good. One could not but be convinced that he was in
thorough earnest, so I sent for a supply to Ellis’s Pharmacy, Erskineville. I used nine boxes, and was
cured. I felt no good effects until I was using the third box ; but after that my recovery was gradual.
The medicine I took before I got Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills would stock a chemist s shop. X had
fallen away five inches round the waist, but I have regained all the lost weight. -I might mention that
the operation which had been suggested was to cost me £6O. My cure by Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
cost me less than 30s. If I had used these pills when I first got ill, I would be considerably over £2OO
richer to-day. My recovery is well known, and may be authenticated, by many; but if any sufferer
would like to call,'l shall be glad to substantiate this testimonial.”
Four years later Mrs. Loaney says :—“ lam pleased to be able to say now that my husband is still
free of kidney trouble. In fact, he was never better in his life, and is without ache or pain. I think his
cure is marvellous, for he is 77.”

have discovered ways of tricking him with poi-
soned baits that would make a dingo smile, and
he is lured within gunshot on moonlight nights by
an imitation of his own yelp.
Once two youths were out carting wood, when
their dogs ran a fox into a hollow log. They
plugged the northern end of the log, chopped it
off above the fox, and plugged the southern end ;
then they lifted it into the dray, and carted it
home. It was kept till Sunday, and invitations
were sent to neighbors to meet on a small plain
with dogs and horses. On Sunday morning the
log was taken out in the cart, and about 20
enthusiasts gathered at the rendezvous to enjoy
the sport. They stood in a group, their bridle reins
over their arms, and holding their dogs. It was
agreed that the quarry should have a good start
in a short run to the timber. The grass was
saddle-deep, and with plenty of cover within
reach the fox had a very fair chance for his life.
When all were ready the youths who had charge
of the dray dropped the tailboard and rolled
the log out. It was only a light shell, and
the concussion burst it into halves. The fox lost
no time in getting into full swing, and was soon
lost to sight in the tall grass. At the same time
the dogs broke away and yowled lustily in his
wake. In the excitement and confusion of the
moment half the horses also broke away, and two
or three of the men were knocked over. About
six mounted and gave chase, but after going half
a mile they came to a deep gully, 100 ft. wide and
with precipitous banks. The great hunt ended
there. At the bottom lay the remains of Reynard,
smothered up by a pack of worrying dogs. In
disgust the hunters rode off in search of a kangaroo
or a dingo.
The tiger cat is also destructive among lambs,
though, fortunately, the cat is not very
numerous. He is a fierce beast to get into holds
with.
In the cultivation paddock the cocky has another
class of animal to fight against. When his corn is
sown the bandicoot follows along in his tracks at
night and roots it up. “ Minding bandicoots ” is
one of the most dismal tasks on earth, and shoot-
ing them on a dark night is the most precarious
sport, there being seldom anything more sight-
able than the thuds of the retreating animal to
shoot at. When the tender plants show green
above ground, the wallabies make their appear-
ance and crop the herbage down. When it has
got beyond their reach, there is a short respite—if
Anderson’s cows don’t break in—until the crop
begins to ripen. Then the black ’possum plays
havoc with it by night, and parrots, redbills,
crows, black magpies and cockatoos swarm upon
it by day. With regard to wallabies and ’possums,
the value of their skins recoups the cocky for time
spent in hunting them ; but there is no indemnity
to be had from the feathered tribes that war
against him.
It is one of the disagreeable experiences of the
cocky to be obliged to leave his bed at daylight
on a cold winter’s morning, and wade waist deep
through wet grass and weeds, and with frost
crackling under foot, to drive cockatoos away
from his corn. Scarecrows, however cunningly
devised, have little effect upon them. One
ingenious planter took much pains to build a
“bogey man” with sticks, which hedressedup in an
old brown suit, topped with a big straw hat. He
set him up on a high stump, with a gun-shaped
stick tied in position to his hands. That agricul-
turist slept late next day, having every faith in
the sentinel. Some time later, however, he was
chagrined to find his crop alive with birds. A
flock of crows were holding a sort of inquesfbn

In many parts wild pigs have become a pest
particularly in the scrubby country of Northern
Queensland, where the depreciated inbred mon-
grels exist in great numbers, and raid the potato
crops, corn and cane fields, and any other acces-
sible products. One appreciable ad van age n
game is that they are more easily coped with than
the small fry. When plagued with insects the
cocky is almost helpless. Moths attack hi*
fruit, aphides and cabbage-fly cover his cabbages,
beetles destroy his skins and bore into his bacon,
sandflies and botflies are a danger to his horses,
ticks and leeches worry his cattle, and caterpillars
of all shapes, sizes and colors attack everything
green. The grasshopper is not regarded as an
enemy, but when it mobilises it can make tilings
hum. In February, 1907, grasshoppers passer
over a field of corn at (nlgandra (IN.o. VV.) corn-
pletelv stripping the leaves from the stalks and
the husks from the cobs.
The cocky notes, with grim humor, that no
matter what he plants some special kind of cater-
pillar comes along to live on it, and persists in
hanging around like a poor relation as lpng as a
leaf remains. “Beats me where th’ ’ell they
come from, or how they get to know,” mused
one. “See here” (dislodging a green half-loop
from his tomato vines), “there wasn t a one o
them sort on the premises till I growed tomai ters.
Now there’s any gorsquantity of era. Same with
the grape vines. See them long fat blanks with

are frequently found also in cane stools, and they
are ploughed up in vast swarms in cultivated
ground. Besides all this, they attack his house
and fences, eating them up till nothing but flimsy,
tottering shells remain. In swampy and scru >by
country, and in damp, deeply-grassed gullies,
leeches are a menace to his dairy herd. Ihey
seem to be particularly partial to the cow s udder,
getting into the teats. At times horses are seen
whose muzzles are simply masses of raw flesh,
the disease having originated, from the bites of
leeches.
A plague of caterpillars is an ugly thing to look
a t, especially when they are in such numbers as
to bring a train to a Passengers on
the Tumut-Cootanmndra (N.SAV.) line in Nov.,
1903, had their train held up by the migratory
caterpillar. The pest swarmed across the rails in
overwhelming numbers, and the wheels after
crushing through the mass for a considerable dis-
tance, became so greasy that they would not
“bite.” Sweeping was tried, and the sand-boxes
were freely used by the driver ; but the wheels
still flew round and the train stood still. Mean-
while the caterpillars swarmed into the carriages,
and walked in a horrible green fashion over the
passengers. Finally bagging vvas tied to the cow-
catcher, so as to sweep the rails before the front
wheels, and, getting a start by this means and by
the use of sand, the train ploughed slowly through
and went away 40 minutes late and covered with
horrible insects.
Every vestige of herbage—everything green—is
mown down before the march of the crawling
horde. The cocky in places keeps rollers running
round his paddock from daylight till dark, only
to find in the morning that the rearguard has come
up in the night, crossed the slimy track, and
assailed crops, grass and everything. A goof
check was adopted by a cane-grower. He ploughed
a deep trench round his crop, and into this he
poured barrels of treacle. The caterpillars tell
in by millions, but frequent raking and replenish-
ing were necessary to prevent others crawling
over the pontoon formed by the mass that
struggled in the molasses. The stench around
that'erop in a day or two simply roared., ■
Of ants the cocky has a great variety, and
likewise of flips; and he has them both m
unlimited numbers. The fly-veil is a neces-
sary part of man’s dress outback ; and it is
common to see veiled horses feeding on the
runs. With night the flies, and most of the. ants,
disappear. Then the mosquitoes come humming
along in myriads. They are not found in water-
less country, their early existence being passed
under water—which water is often alive with
beetles, tadpoles, and numerous smaller insects in
addition. Smoke is the common means of defence
against the mosquito. Cowdung is burnt at the
doors and in the rooms, and the cocky breathes
the odor of burning ordure nearly all night.
His house is seldom troubled with fleas or bugs,
but the drawers and crevices are often living
masses of cockroaches ; and in scrubby places he
has two varieties of tick to contend against. One
is a big brute which bores in to his anatomy, and into
that of his dog. The other is a tiny insect which
attacks.in numbers, to make up for its smallness.
Unwelcome visitors are centipedes, scorpions, and
black spiders. A 12in. centipede is just as
objectionable for a bedmate as a black snake.
Moths, silver-fish, and other household pests add
their quantum of worry, while rats and mice are
a nuisance in field and barn. They play havoc
with harness and leather goods, and assist the
weevils in depreciating the stored grain.
The beetle industry in Queensland provides
pocket money for a host of people. In one month
in 1904 the Cairns Beetle Board paid for two
tons of borers at Is. per pound. When the bonus
tor beetle scalps was first started, the insects were
counted by the receivers, but the collectors
brought them along in such vast numbers that the
expedient of paying by weight was adopted.
Then the villainous small boy soaked the catch
overnight, and the increase of expenditure on
beetle-destruction was so marked that soon the
old method of counting was reverted to.
A formidable pest is the flying fox. which flops
into the trees at night, crawling and flapping over
the branches, and leaving an abominable odor
upon everything it touches. One of the most
remarkable sights I ever saw was a colony of
flying foxes in a clump of trees near Gundarimbar
(N.SiW.). They numbered many thousands, all
hanging head downwards, closely together, and
in places hanging to one another.
Considering the variety of the vast army of
natural enemies that is ever waging war against
him, day and night, Sunday and Christmas Day
included, it is not to be wondered at that the
average cocky on the far-back creeks is a fairly
good bush naturalist, and can beguile many an
hour relating anecdotes and describing peculiari-
ties of insects, birds and beasts.
EDWARD S. SORENSON.
His Hat.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f little old gentleman with the white
moustache ran on to the platform and
made a scrambling dash for the Brighton
train. He fumbled wildly with the handle,
tumbled in anyhow, and fell panting on the seat.
A porter who had yelled the information at him
as he was charging the carriage, followed him up,
and, letting down the window, said with a sneer.
‘ This train don’t start for another ten minutes ! ”
Then he strode on.
The old gentleman was too flurried and hot to
take any notice of the remark. He mopped his
brow and panted, blew out his cheeks, and appar-
ently thanked God that he had caught the train
without accident. Then, when he had cooled
down a little, he lifted his belltopper off his head
with both hands, and placed it carefully beside
him on the seat. It required no Sherlock Holmes
to see that his shining belltopper was the
apple of his eye and the banana of his old age.
He glanced sideways at it, and pulled it a trifle
nearer to him. He flicked it gently with his
handkerchief, and made passes at a beetle that
was attracted by the shine of the'silk, and wanted
to skate on it. When the beetle flew out in
disgust he gazed after it and sighed with relief.
Then he had another look at the pineapple of his
existence, and, seeing it was still safe, lay back
and closed his eyes.
A bell rang far down the platform, the guard’s
whistle shrilled out, and the engine answered
with a mournful hoot.
Two girls rushed up from the subway.
“Stand back there !. .. Stand back ! ”
“ Come on, Jess !. . . Quickly ?”
The door was flung open, and two laughing
masses of white muslin jumped in—clutched
staggered and— fell on the sacred hat!
There was an inarticulate cry of horror and
despair, and the old gentleman motioned them
with trembling hands to get up.
They jumped up immediately, and, seeing the
ruin, said together, in perfect time, “ Oh-h !
we’re so sorry ! ”
He took no notice whatever. For the time
being, words had no significance for him. He
held the wreck tenderly in his hands and groaned.
Now and then he made little, pathetic, futile
attempts to shake and pat it into shape—but the
thing couldn’t have been ruined more completely
if three camels had danced on it for a week.
He got out at South Yarra —got out like a man
fresh from some gigantic and overwhelming dis-
aster. Napoleon arriving from Moscow might
have entered Paris just like that with the ruins of
a hat in his hands and his eyes, looking straight
ahead at the Pantheon or the Hotel de Ville. He
held the remains tightly clutched in his right
hand, he looked straight ahead with a wild and
glassy stare, and when they asked him for his
ticket he just moaned.

A Wonderful Blood Purifier
A Grateful Mother Writes:
JiR
n
“My little son suffered ter-
ribly with eczema. His head
and face were one mass of
sores, and I thought he would
be disfigured for life. But no,
after taking five bottles of
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla he was
entirely cured. You are at
liberty to use this photo and
testimonial as you like, as I
can attribute my son’s cure
to nothing but Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla.
Yours gratefully,
Mrs. L. Wilson,
Adelaide.”
As now made, Ayer’s Sarsaparilla contains no alcohol.
Make sure that you get “Ayer’s” Sarsaparilla —not some
other kind, put up to imitate it, and which will do you no good.

PLAIN TRUTHS
on the subject of Health are the only acceptable pronouncements.
Exaggerated statements end by convincing no one—rather do they create
suspicion, and give rise to doubt. But you may safely listen to universal
opinion. The public have for long known the value of Beecham’s Pills
m cases of disorder and irregularity of the Stomach, Bowels, Liver and
Jyidneys. Thousands of men and women know, from glad experience,
that an occasional dose of Beecham’s Pills will promote the healthv action
ot these organs, and that all the good things heard on every hand
ABOUT
this medicine are true in the strictest sense. Most people desire a
specific that can be depended upon at all times to correct the vital
functions when they are out of order and Nature calls for some assist-
ance. Such a preparation may be found in BEECHAM’S PILLS.
They will put you right and keep you .up to the mark. They have
proved an immense boon to many thousands of men and women
all over the world. It is just as certain that they will benefit you—
and this is a plain truth you may accept and act upon in regard to
