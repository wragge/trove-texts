The Red Page
AUGUST, 1914.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Time was grown weary and the gods were fled;
Gone ■were the glories of the days of old;
The legendary wonders aH were dead;
And earth lay slumbering under stars
grown cold.
But sudden a magic set ‘he skies a flare;
The world awoke; and. now, by sea and
shore.
Adventure mills to men to do and dare.
And wonders walk the common, waifs once
more.
Monsters are slain, that poison all the
breeze;
And wyverns fight and flame across the sun;
And jovial fishermen, in misty seas,
Net the leviathans; and deeds are done
Worthy the gods of old, since, yesteryear,
The call of August rang afar and 'clear.
M.L.
BARTLETT ADAMSON.
1915
The annual examinations held in the sub-
ject of Australasian Literature by The
University of the lied Page, but not yet ini-
tiated by any of the other Australasian Uni-
versities, were, despite the war, well at-
tended.
In the paper set for Poetry a remarkably
high level of excellence ■ was maintained.
Will Lawson, in The Three Kings, merely
carried on a belated tradition. Louis Lav-
ater supplied, in Blue' Dags and Grey Days,
some fine sonnets. Nettie Palmer sub-
mitted two papers, The South ll ind and
Shadoicy Paths, both poetic, but her second
essay showed no improvement on the deli-
cate charm of her first. Dorothy F.
MeCrae proved disappointing in The Clear
Call, a paper of hurried war-verse. Henry
Lawson obliged, as usual, with a typically
Australian contribution, My Army, O My
Army, that, coming from an unknown
author, would have proved exciting, but as
the product of an established and popular
poet merely showed that he could still occa-
sionally reach his own level. .T. P. Bourke,
in Off the Blucbush, wrote of Westralia in
an out-moded manner. A new and
authentic liorse-poet—more horse than poet
—was discovered in a modest competitor
named Wm. Jas. Wye, whose Souvenirs of
the Sunny South deserves, among the
horses, a larger popularity. Margaret
Fleming offered light, sparkling wine in
baby bottles, labelled Mirrors of Silver.
“Firenze,” in Old Blues and Reds, allowed
the war occasionally to inspire her; but
George Gordon MeCrae failed to find that
inspiration in The Fleet and Convoy.
d*
Five competitors stood out: Chris J.
Brennan, Archibald T. Strong, Nina Mur-
doch, Vance Palmer and C. J. Dennis. The
two newcomers, Nina Murdoch and V ance
Palmer, made noteworthy contributions to
Australian poetry. Nina Murdoch’s paper.
Songs of the Open Air, introduced to Aus-
tralia, though not to the Red Page Univer-
sity, a series of admirable sonnets and some
poetry of a high order. Her promise is
already a performance. Vance Palmer col-
lected in The Forerunners a series of authen-
tic Australian impressions—black opals in
which the fire gleamed owing to the skill
with which they were polished and set. The
other three competitors were old hands.
Chris J. Brennan sent in an extraordinarily
bulky package of poetry aud words, ticketed
Poems. The poetry was there, and, of its
high kind, nearly perfect; but it was ob-
scured too often beneath the words. As a
tardy portrait of an arresting personality in
our literature, evidently photographed some
years ago, the work was welcome. It was,
however, the 'portrait of Chris J. Brennan,
poet (retired). Archibald T. Strong’s Son-
nets of Empire were expected of him; and
he has given additional proof of his earnest
devotion to a dignified muse. His sonnets,
especially his Australian sonnets, make a
permanent contribution to our literature.
But both these competitors fail, through
their learning, to touch the heart of Aus-
tralia. That necessary, though perhaps not
so noble, function, was given to C. J.
Dennis, whose Sentimental Bloke was the
most interesting and the most delightful
paper submitted. The other poets wrote
brilliantly and beautifully about Australia:
Dennis, with a caressing touch and a deep
understanding, wrote Australian. The Sen-
timental Bloke was the achievement of the
year.
A large number of students competed for
the Red Page scholarship in Minus Poetry.
Rose de Boheme’s The Call of the Blood,
A. Safroni-Middleton’s Bush Songs and
Oversea Voices , “Viva’s” Bugle Blasts, John
Roycroft’s Rime and Rhythm. .1. K.
French’s A Pearl of Price, II. J. Bell’s N.Z.
Camp Fire Recitations, and I. M. Batten’s
Star Dust and Sea Foam showed many
minus qualities; but no award was made,
as none had reached the 90 per cent, mini-
mum required. But to each of the above
commended students a poet’s license has
been granted. This is merely a matter of
form, as all the students showed that they
were, illegally, already using that license.
The examiner noted, with poignant regret,
that the name of his favorite minus-poet,
“Bellerive,” was not among the competitors.
J*
The fiction paper was not up to the stan-
dard of the poetry paper. The best of the
average Australian novels submitted were
Boyd Cable’s By Blow and Kiss and Kath-
erine S. Prichard’s The Pioneers —both well-
fashioned stories of Australian adventure,
worthy to rank with the contemporary ad-
venture yarn from overseas. Roy Bridges
made good use of our early history in The
Fugitive; but the picture of The Pioneers
covered a larger canvas, and was painted
with more seriousness. Ambrose Pratt, of
course, provided, hot from his fiction oven.
a neatly constructed war story, 1 Var in the
Pacific. Passing by the negligible papers
contributed by Arthur Wright (A Sport
from Hollow Log Flat), and L. D.
Stranger’s conventional The Great Snake
Murder, and remembering, without much
enthusiasm, J. A. Philp’s matter-of-fact
collection of Some Bulletin Stories, the
examiner became interested in The Lure of
the Land, by E. M. Weetwood. This
paper had all the faults of the beginner and
some of the enthusiasms, but future papers
submitted by this student will be carefully
read. In the adventure class Grocer Great-
heart, by Arthur 11. Adams, was submitted
in the non-competitive section.
In the novel of social adventures Henry
James James’s Double-Bed Dialogues suc-
ceeded in worrying the morals of the much-
married. Miss Bryde of England, by Alice
Grant Rosman, was an admirable essay in
a familiar medium, quite as good as the
average English novel of Bohemian life. The
World of Men, a collection of realistic Aus-
tralian short-stories, lacked the grip of Vance
Palmer’s poetry. L’homme au Soleil
Couch ant, by Paul Wenz, an intimate and
pleasant study of the Backbloefes, written
for his French audience, would prove
acceptable to Australia if translated. The
only novel that deserves a prize is Betty
Wayside, by the conscientious Louis Stone.
While not another Jonah, this novel accu-
rately pictures a strata of contemporary
Sydney life, and as such is a small contribu-
tion to our national literature.
The competitors in the Flapperature sub-
section were numerous. D. Egerton Jones’s
name was noted with surprise in this class.
Her Time o’ Day, though excellent food for
flappers, was a disappointment after Peter
Piper. Gem of the Flat, by Constance
Maekness, proved entertainingly Australian.
Isabel Maud Peacocke, with My Friend
Phil, avoided the mawkishness usual in the
kiddie-hero, by making him realistically Aus-
tralian. Among a host of other Flappera-
ture Ethel Turner’s The Cub stood out.
Jt
In the science examination J. H. Maiden
submitted further valuable essays upon our
Forest Flora and The Genus Eucalyptus;
and J. M. and H. E. Coane wrote with know-
ledge of Australasian Roads.
The descriptive papers approved }of in-
cluded Freda du Faur’s stirring and charm-
ingly-written The Conquest of Mount Cook,
and Elsie R. Masson’s interesting account of
An Untamed Territory. A. Saffroni-Middle-
ton’s Sailor and Beachcomber was poorly-
written mush for English consumption only.
H. M. Vaughan’s An Australasian Wander-
Year was faintly entertaining—to Austral-
asians.
In Sociology and Politics, the best paper
submitted was W. Jethro Brown’s The Pre-
vention and Control of Monopolies.
In the Autobiography section The Record
of Nicholas Freydon, by a student who failed
to sign his name, was the only notable con-
tribution.
In the Historical section, Fredk. Watson
furnished his usual paper of Historical Re-
cords of Australia, and Ida Lee submitted
The Logbooks of the Lady Nelson—& small
but useful contribution to our records.
The entries in the Humor section, exclud-
ing, of course. C. J. Dennis’s Sentimental
Bloke, which belonged to a higher class of
literature, contained only one work of
genuine humor, The Paralysis of a Nation,
by that unexpected humorist, Bruce Smith.
There was but one competitor in the
dramatic section, Montague Grover, whose
The Minus Quantity and Other Short Plays
contained at least one useful contribution to
Australian drama.
Bibliography, Philosophy and Literary
Criticism each attracted only one student.
Percy J. Marks compiled Australian Shakes-
pearana; AY. J. Chidley wrote his much
enlarged Answer; and J. ,J. Malone sub-
mitted some early Talks about Poets and
Poetry. Sport and Theology attracted not
a single student.
The war was responsible for a number of
negligible papers, and Dr. A. A. Martin’s
interesting Surgeon in Khaki.
In the Art section D. H. Souter and Hal
Eyre sent in their War Cartoons; Norman
Lindsay gave of his best in ' Norman
Lindsay’s Book; Madeline E. King proffered
a tiny series of artistic drawings of Sydney ;
R. T. Baker, artistically ill-equipped, did
useful spade-work in The Waratah in Ap-
plied Art.; and David Low lifted the art of
caricature in Australia by his big book of
brilliant Caricatures.
J*
In making the selection of the best papers
for a permanent place on The Bulletin
Bookshelf other considerations than merit
may be weighed. In the case of such a pro-
mising beginner as Nina Murdoch the ex-
aminer feels that she has not yet given of
her best, and thus she is advised to stand
aside this year, in the expectation that
some day her Collected Poems will dignify
that bookshelf. Archibald T. Strong lias
already one notable volume on that shelf,
and his Sonnets of Empire have weaknesses
in them that place, this volume on a lower
level than his Ballades of Theodore de Ban-
ville. In the case of Chris .T. Brennan, the
examiner feels that no greater volume is to be
expected of him, and he can afford to stand
on his record. Vance Palmer hardly
measures up with these giants.
In the fiction section the only paper out-
standing is Louis Stone’s Betty Wayside;
but it does not stand out very much, and it
does not compare with that student’s bril-
liant Jonah. And Jonah was the first work
put on The Bulletin Bookshelf when it
was started in 1912.
So the additions to the shelf this year are
two; (1) The Sentimental Bloke, by C. J.
Dennis, the book of the Australian year,
and (2) Poems, by Chris J. Brennan.

Gallipoli Bill
E. C. Buley, an ex-Australian jour-
nalist in London, seldom puts his
name to his publications. Those scrappy,
topical books, The Real Kaiser and
The Dardanelles, issued anonymously,
are now credited to his authorship. But
to Glorious Deeds of Australasians in
the Great War (Melrose, 3s. 6d.) E. G.
Buley has a right to sign his name ; for this
record of a valiant adventure undertaken
by a new sort of soldier is by far the finest
book yet written of Anzac. Doubtless others
as good, or better, will come; but Buley gets
in first. He relates that in gathering the
materials for this book lie has interviewed
some hundreds of wounded Australasian sol-
diers in London hospitals ; and that he has
resisted, though with difficulty, the tempta-
tion to record individual deeds of remarkable
bravery, because this force “consists of men
who are all heroes. After the first few days
on Gallipoli its officers recognised the im-
possibility of officially recognising deeds of
bravery, and practically no awards have
been made since the end of April.”
It - is not, however, the admirably-
written history of Australia’s share, naval
and military, in the war, nor the
detailed account of Australia’s military and
naval system that gives the book its high
value; nor does that value lie in the
republication of the many official speeches
and public testimonies to the bravery and
resource of our troops; it is, rather, the
graphic and genuine portrait that Buley has
drawn of the finest soldier in the world,
Gallipoli Bill. That portrait is a composite
one, made from "a number of brilliant narra-
tives obtained by the author from the reluc-
tant lips of Bill’s mates.
“The Man Who Wasn’t Let” is one of
the most amazing true stories of the
war, told with a full appreciation* of its
Australian hpmor. This Australian “Leather-
head” (a tall, well-set Australian,
wearing the all-wool khaki of the
Commonwealth and the neat leather cap of
the Australian Divisional Supply Column)
actually enlisted with a glass eye. “It’s a
good 0ne.... I have come to the conclusion
that a man doesn’t need two eyes, except in
case of accident, like mine....l joined the
militia. I got my musketry certificate, so
that shows you a man with one eye can
shoot as well as any man with two. and a
sight better than most of them.... When I
was in Sydney I learned to drive a motor-
car, and never had any trouble Nobody
ever noticed ; I used to get on well with girls,
and all that; and they’re the first to grumble
if a man’s got anything wrong with him.”
The doctor never tumbled, to his glass eye;
and he passed his driving test as a motorist.
But he had to go into hospital after having
been inoculated against typhoid, and both
his glass eye and his secret came out when
the doctor examined him. But that doctor
was a sport. In England, however, he had
to undergo another medical examination be-
fore proceeding to the Front; and to him
the Australian confessed. “But you never
know what you’re doing with these English
doctors: they’re not reasonable chaps like in
Australia.” He was left behind. However,
he fell in with some Canadian soldiers, “real
good sorts,” borrowed a Canadian slouch hat,
fell in with the company and got aboard the
transport. He managed to remain unde-
tected until he reached the trenches, whefe
the Canadian officer discovered that his ser-
geant had one man too many-—“a long Aus-
tralian galoot, that wants to have a shot at
the Germans, so we brought him with us.”
Rut the officer objected. The Australian
wouldn t have the sense to get killed; he
would probably be wounded, and then how
was the officer to account for him? He had
g ,°" , turned U P at a base hospital,
chucked his eye away, asked for an eyeshade,
and returned on a train as one of the poor
wounded. The doctors were surprised at
the rapid recovery his eye had made. Back
ill London he rejoined his old corps, and now
he is getting another glass eye. “And I’m
going to have it riveted in, and soldered down
and fastened in its place with concrete; then
I’m going to enlist with Kitchener’s boys.”
Gallipoli Bill is enriching the Australian
language by a considerable contribution of
Arabic. “There is the battle-cry ‘lmshi
Yalla,’ which means, ‘Get on with it,’ as
far as we can make out. Then there is
‘Mafish’ (finished). It was the last word
on the lips of many a good man in those
days at the end of last April. The ordinary
camp greeting is ‘Sayeeda’—‘Good-day,’ or
‘How d’ye do?’ as I take it. There’s a word
or two more, but there is no need to trans-
late them. They are useful words.” Which
gives this page hope that a substitute more
sonorous has been found for the great Aus-
tralian adjective.
Typically Australian is the story of two
platoons that got further inland at the land-
ing than anyone else. “They lost all their
officers and most of their non-coms, quite
early. The rest only knew' they were there
to take a hill, and so they took one.- Then,
for fear that might be the wrong hill, they
took another. That set them off taking all
the hills in sight, a pretty tall order. They
only stopped when they blundered on to the
Turkish camp; the wonder is that any of
them ever got back.”
And strangely stirring to the blood is the
story of the Maori contingent just before a
charge, waiting for the whistle that would
unleash them. They could not dance their
ancient liaka, so they sang it silently, beat-
ing out the rhythm of it with their
clenched fists on the ground. And nothing
in the war was more pitiable than the “epic
of suffering” that 400 wounded Maoriland-
ers heroically endured in the Valley of Tor-
ment on the side of Sari Bair, lying for two
days beyond the reach of the Bed Cross
men, suffering and dying without a murmur.
This is the sort of book that almost brings
tears into the eyes of the Australian reader:
but they are tears of pride. For it is a
generous tribute to the finest soldier in the
world, Gallipoli Bill. And Gallipoli Bill
will read it. with a deprecatory grin, hon-
estly amused to discover that the world
thinks him a hero.
«
Harold Lindsay: “Te Babarantiko”
wishes to know (B. 2S/10/T5) what a
“palm-needle” is, and also a watch’s "boss.”
A “palm-needle” is a colloquialism for sail-
maker’s needle. A watch’s “boss” is an
improvement on the time-w T orn “fo’c's’le
bully.” He states. ... “the blokes”; an -ex-
pression I will take my affidavit is new on
board ship. .. . ” This is almost pathetic.
On the majority of English ships “blokes” is
a stock word, and shares with “damn!”
“coves,” “hell,” etc., the honors of frequent
use. Also, in the British Navy, the term
of endearment used by the Lower Deck when
referring to the commander is “The Bloke.”
He says, “. . . . the average sailor is as well
spoken as, and, on the whole, better educated
than, the ordinary shore Workman.” On
three subjects—seafaring, women and drink
—the average sailor is an accepted authority.
Qn the other 97 out of a possible 300 the
shore-workman can beat him by miles. The
better an education a young man has had
the less likely will he be to adopt seafaring
as a profession—this in all deference to
sailors who are unquestionably Men in the
manliest interpretation of the term.
“Verdad” on Conrad’s Spanish: I have
often been irritated by the murder-
ing of the Spanish language by English
authors. The Spanish words and phrases
that are nowadays often scattered through
books are usually incorrect. Take, for in-
stance, Romance, by Conrad and Hueffer.
This books contains such atrocities as Ingles,
for Ingles (z is certainly pronounced like's
in Latin America, but like th in pure Cas-
tillian), se bienvienido for sea bienvenido,
opprimido for oprimido (p is never doubled
in Spanish). In most cases the accent is
omitted, as quien sabe? for quien sabe?
(In Spanish this is printed / quien sabe?)
Without the accent quien is not interroga-
tive but relative, e.g., in such a phrase as
“The man who knows.” Instead of misusing
the language it would be better to omit the
Spanish altogether, and tell the tale in Eng-
lish, adding a note that the author is really
a clever cuss, and knows Spanish thoroughly.
If he is a more imaginative liar he can say
he is a whale at Hottentot and Thibetian.
“LAY.”: In your review of Tchekoff’s
Stories of Russian Life (_25/11/’ls) you
mention the tale of a monastery, a prior, and
the result of his sermonising. Enclosed you
will find a tale of mine (well, nearly mine)
which I wrote 15 years ago. I submitted it
to The Bulletin at the time, and, “kid-
like,” was hard hit by the fun poked at it.
But the chief point lies in the fact that I
stole the tale from a Spaniard, acknowledg-
ing it as “from the Spanish”; and transla-
tion of Ms tale appeared in London Sketchy
Bits 16 years ago. What I would like to
know is did Tchekoff steal from my Spaniard
or vice persa?

Hunting Rifles
There are more Winchester rifles used for
hunting than all other American makes com-
bined. That is because they are so generally
satisfactory. Experienced hunters know that
Winchester rifles can be depended upon
absolutely. Then, again, they are made in all
calibers and styles suitable for shooting any
kind of game. For a good, reliable rifle, one
that shoots strong and accurately, and gives
years of service, no rifle equals the Win-
chester. No need of hesitating as to which
make of hunting rifle to buy. Get a Win-
chester and you will never regret it. They are
THE FIRST CHOICE OF
EXPERIENCED HUNTERS

Tobacco
Rills!
MOST MEN would
cure themselves of
the Tobacco Habit if
they knew they could
do so easily and also
without causing
themselves discom-
fort. ... It takes but
ten minutes for To-
bacco to change the
beats of the heart.
To keep it up is to
tempt death by heart
disease, nervous col-
lapse, tobacco cancer
and stomach, liver or
kidney disease.
TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harm-
less, vegetable remedy that will make the
user of tobacco in any form absolutely aban-
don the habit for good. It not destroys the
craving, the desire, the appetite for tobacco,
but restores to health the entire nervous sys-
tem, and aids Nature in entirely eliminating
from the system the Nicotine Poison of
Tobacco.

Rheumatism
The case of Rheumatism or Gout
which Kruschen Salts cannot benefit
has yet to be discovered. This
famous British remedy is also
recommended by Medical Men in
cases of Lumbago, Sciatica, Eczema,
Constipation, and Liver and Kidney
Disorders.
KRUSCHEN AT THE FRONT
Since the outbreak of the War, enormous
quantities of Kruschen Salts have been ordered
by, and delivered to the British Authorities, for
the use of the British Forces overseas and in
the Base Hospitals at Home. Kruschen Salts
are prescribed by Medical Men the world over.
THE WORD KRUSCHEN
The trade mark “ Kruschen ” is a legacy-
handed down from generation to generation of
the family of Evan Grifliths Hughes, the sole
Manufacturers of Kruschen Salts, and one of
the oldest firms of Manufacturing Chemists in
the County of Lancashire. Established 1754
160 years ago.

VAR IOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
By the River.
At twilight by the riverside
The long weeds toss and quiver,
with life the evening tide
Runs slowly up the river.
Above the wharves and silent docks
The homing gulls go winging;
A fishing boy upon the rocks
Stands idle, idly singing.
Above him bend the greying skies
And all about is quiet,
Save where, in quest of passing flies,
The mullet leap and riot.
The lights that gleamed along the west
Are dead, or slowly dying;
The long-haired sheoaks sink to rest,
The breeze within them sighing. „
Worn townsmen, tired of desk and stool,
On yonder homing ferry,
Hats off, their fevered brows to cool,
All care and trouble bury.
From yonder green and grassy sward,
The still, tall trees forsaking,
A launch with golden girls aboard
Her homeward way is making.
All day, all day with cheeks aglow,
All in the summer weather,
Iled-sashed, and dressed in cream and
snow,
They laughed and danced together.
Oh, life is sweet, and love is sweet,
And sweet beyond all measure
Is youth that moves with dancing feet
A-down rose-ways of pleasure.
The good tide sluices bank and bar,
The ripples break and quiver ;
The darkness palls, and moon and star
Are mirrored in the river.
N.S.W.
RODERIC QUINN.
Waiting at the Door.
The rambling house is old and plain,
Through gnarled old elms its white stones
gleam,
And in the shade are quaint old seats
Where old men smoke and dream.
The city’s tide of life swings by
In endlessness of ebb and flow;
Outside the whitened picket fence
The clanging tramcars go.
Within, the life-tide only ebbs—
The fading pulse, the falling breath;
With wrinkling skin and dimming eyes
The old men wait for death.
No more for them the toil, the strife,
The long, grim fight with mastering fate;
Broken, defeated, worn and grey,
They sit and smoke and wait.
Yet they have lived ; their fading eyes
Were once alight with hope’s fierce fires,
And in their heart-beats seemed to throb
Invincible desires.
Some loved with hot youth’s ardent flame,
Some hated with a red, wild hate,
And some were stern with high resolve
To snatch a prize from fate.
They trod the devious ways men go,
They hoped for Heaven, they lived for Hell.
They served their. God with kindling souls,
And they served Mammon well.
Is this the end? This old, plain house,
These elms through which the white stones
gleam ;
These shaded, quaintly-fashioned seats
Where old men smoke and dream?
Is this the end? To all the same,
The last result of callous fate?
Battered and broken, grey and worn,
They sit and smoke and wait!
TASMANIA.
O’PHIMERTY.
Baghdad.
The palm grove on the .round tower casts
The flickering shadows of its masts; .
The figs are fruited thick ;
Pomegranates pleasant sins confess
To house fronts, grim and windowless,
And walls of orange brick.
Here there are mosque-domes green and
white,
Grass-roofed bazaars, whose filtered light
Wakes song in some sick bird
A prisoner in its cage of reed,
And stirs a pity for its need
In that swart-visaged Kurd
Until he flings some paltry coins
Plucked from the belt about his loins
Where dagger hilts jut through,
And slides apart the wicker door
For joy to see the brown wings soar,
Ecstatic, to the blue.
A woman watches by a wall;
Her ample skirts about her fall
And out her black veil floats
In gentle breezes, river born,
That bring the sunny scent of corn
From light, skin-covered boats.
The slave outside the screened serai
Will doze against the water jar,
And when the eve is cool
The caliph will himself ride forth,
Along the river to the north,
Upon his jewelled mule,
And when the first white stars come out
Will turn his following about
Through sand-drifts dry and deep,
To pray beside a cone-shaped tomb,
Where lies in tender twilight gloom
Zobeide asleep.

great exposition of the value of embodied
force began. All the benefits conferred on
him by wisely constructed Socialistic legis-
lation availed the German worker little
then. They were only the means to an end,
and the end had arrived. Obedient to their
omnipotent masters, the grey-coated masses
marched to their doom, and the world
roused itself. And ever since then the
world has had increasing reason to
arouse itself more and more. In such cir-
cumstances it is of no avail to stand around
and preach platitudes on the superiority of
Peace. The necessity at the present moment
is to grasp the wild animal that believes in
War and choke him off the face of the
earth. Then, and not till then, it will be
time to talk of schemes to ensure peace on
earth and goodwill towards men. Pointing to
the horrors of war as an excuse for evading
war’s burdens is a short-cut to the horrors
of a peace obtained by giving a war-drunk
nation full control over us and our destinies.
If the Central Towers win, militarism and
autocracy and the doctrines of “Frightful-
ness” get an enormous boost on this planet.
If they are thoroughly crushed and hammered
out, the world will have insisted on the right of
each nation to work out its own destinies,
so long as it does not unduly interfere with
other nations; and the criminal folly of
attempting to conquer the world by force,
and make one race the ruling race, will be
established for at least a long time. Those
who stand aside and prate of their dislike of
war, and who put in time dilating on its evils,
while actively or passively resisting every
honest attempt to stay the progress of the
greatest exponents of War as a paying
business, are doing good work towards en-
throning War as mankind’s greatest idol, and
relegating dishevelled and disgraced Peace
to a very humble position.

The Gamble that Didn’t Come Off.
It looks as if Billjim and his mate from
Maoriland were the only ones at Gallipoli
who from the first day to the last didn’t get
a beating. But they got a rough handling,
all the same, and if the Turk was glad to
see the last of them, it seems fairly certain
that Bill and his mates were not sorry to
shift camp. lan Hamilton’s despatch
gives them generous praise, and it seems to
be established beyond question that from
the morning the Australian infantry landed
at Gaba Tepe until the night they reached
the skyline of Chunuk Bair and bloodily re-
pulsed the later counter-attacks of the
enemy, our lads fought and died with a fine
courage. But, after all, the ginger Bill
put into the fight is only part of the story,
its effect being to make more poignant the
regrets associated with the campaign.
Twice the Australians pushed open the door
to victory—on the first morning when they
turned up and chased the Turk inland for
several miles, and instead (as would have
been the case had they been supported) of
sitting astride the peninsula were pushed
back when Abdul got his second wind and
found the strength of what had arrived ; and
again when during the terrible battle of
August they seized the Ridges that were the
key of the position, and were there left
hanging in the air through failure of the
army on the left to push on its attack.
Hamilton began that fight with the Aus-
tralians and Maorilanders “still holding an
open doorway, whence one strong thrust
would give us the command of the Nar-
rows.” What followed all comes down to
this, that the thrust was mulled, and when
the week’s struggle ended in the attacking
forces being, withdrawn from their advanced
positions, the War Office was unable or un-
willing to fling in a fresh body of troops to
strike the weakened enemy. Hamilton’s
despatch must, of course, in the circum-
stances be regarded as a piece of special
pleading on his own behalf, but it appears
reasonable to accept the conclusion that,
had the army under General Stopford
operating from Suvla Bay been handled with
resolution and made any sort of fight at all,
the work would have been completed. For
this the blame may be on Stopford, but
Hamilton’s share is great—especially if
Stopford and his divisional commanders
were men of his own choosing. And that
seems so, judging by the fact that he was
able to supersede Stopford. At any rate,
it was Hamilton’s job, and the “fatal iner-
tia” that overtook the army which should
have supported the Australians shows that
there was a very large hole in that strict
co-ordination of command and effort which
alone could save the attacking force from
disaster. The generalship of the landing
on Gallipoli failed to complete the work of
the soldiery. In August it did the same
thing, with more painful consequences ; and
as there were by that time something like a
quarter of a million men down, one way
and another, it is not surprising that the
gamble went on no further. That the men
fought like they did is the one thing to be
proud of in connection with the whole shock-
mg business.
Recruiting Trade.
,^ ie h un t after the trade that Germany
used to have Blundell, S. Australia’s Min-
affer of Industry, has taken the best turning
so far. He sees that the German built up his
'ast business connection and his tremendous
smashing power by putting a man and a pair
m spectacles into a laboratory and inciting
nem to find out how to make use of waste
products. And what they found out they
naturally didn’t tell the world: they just
made a contract for a million tons of the
■waste at 2d. a ton, and put up a factory at
lamburg or Freiburg or somewhere to earn
wages for the German workman and profits
°r the German manufacturer. For years and
. ears Australia sent its Cobar gold-copper
netal to Germany before it discovered that
le , Sold in the bullion was worth anything,
ana then it was a German chemist who told
le owners about it; it was a German chemist
no first reported on the zinc ores of Aus-
jajia, a German co. which first put up ex-
pniimental works to prepare the ore for ship-
ent, and naturally enough they are German
netal firms which have since controlled the
ndustry. So with S. Australia’s own grass
lee, which Germany, and Germany only, has
een eagerly buying and putting to uses
® C3 j ?°. m °i’e than guess at. Blun-
ell, deciding to do systematically for our
vaste products what Germany has done
inecemeal’ has struck the excellent idea of
establishing a Department of Chemistry
under a well-known home-grown scientist, W.
a. Hargreaves. Some ordinary jobs, such
a ?* ai j a y Sls ooc * an< J drugs, will be
attended to; but the main work of the staff
will be to root out those hitherto unused
assets of the State which can be turned to
economic value. Already the Government has
been shown how to save over £lOOO a year
in one direction alone ; and the experiments
made with minerals capable of producing
commercial paints are expected to give re-
sults pretty soon.
♦-
The Tyranny of Compulsion by Howls.
What sort of foolery is this? A cable
message from Ottawa states:—
The Canadian Government has announced that
young men employed in the public offices who are fit
for military service but decline to enlist will be
deprived of their positions.
It looks like a brutal announcement that
under the voluntary system the citizen who
chooses in a certain way shall get a punch
on the nose. That is not voluntaryism, or
even a distant relation of it. It is coercion
of a cruel and most improper character, for
it applies to a certain class of individuals
a pressure the other fellow escapes. For
the State to say to Tom, one of its employ-
ees, “Here, get into khaki or be fired,” while
it lets Dick, the bottle-oh, and his brother
Harry, the bank clerk, carry on business as
usual, is a piece of tyranny which any
British State ought to be ashamed of.
Under the sane system of universal service
all three of them would be treated on the
level. This hanging on to the voluntary
“principle,” after confessing that in order
to support it we must outrage every other
principle, is becoming a very depressing
thing to contemplate. For a time there was
a certain measure of hilarity about it all;
but since the undemocratic shibboleth has
turned out to be only workable by yelling
“shirker,” and bellowing about cold feet,
and demanding that a man be heaved out of
his job, and delivering speeches at him
(speakers being surreptitiously granted tram
fares and beer money), the humor of the sit-
uation has been lost. Why not be honest
and straightforward and do aboveboard and
well what we are now doing badly in a dis-
creditable, underhand way?
«
Blisters on the Wrong Hands.
The business of raising blisters on hands
which don’t require them, in an attempt to
clear French’s Forest, near Sydney, for
returned soldiers, may be very interesting
as part of the patriotic circus, but doesn’t
reflect much credit on the country’s genius
for organisation. Organisation means little
more than doing your own job thoroughly,
its main feature being simply the association
of men in such a way as to get the maximum
of good out of their efforts. Six good bush-
men would clear more heavy bush in a day
than 82 clerks of the ordinary sort; in fact,
one real bushman would cut down more big
trees than 82,429 shopwalkers. Certainly
French’s Forest is not heavy bush, and prac-
tically anybody can pick up a small stick;
but on a plain economic basis the work done
by the volunteers is not likely to pay for the
cost of the food consumed by them while at
the job, much less for the valuable advertis-
ing space given them in the newspapers.
The facts that the labor is freely given, that
it is supplied in holiday time, and. that a lot
of enthusiasm is thrown into it, doesn’t
matter in the least; the effort is still wasted
from the point of view of the scientific
organiser. At the present moment clerks
of military age are employed by the Govern-
ment in the task of asking other clerks of
military age why they don’t enlist. If the
schoolmasters and others who are scratching
their fingers at French’s Forest want to help,
why are they not set to work of that kind,
allowing their salaries to go in payment of
bushmen who would tear out the unnecessary
scrub and whack down the useless trees?
But tiiis foolishness of doing another man’s
job badly for no wages has strong attractions
and is likely to go on.
Let Us Feast on Words and Take a
German Pill.
A large, assorted pile of German drugs, from
a detained enemy vessel, auctioned in Mel-
bourne by direction of the Federal Customs
brought high prices recently. For £4l
Melbourne Hospital secured one little lot
which before the war would have cost but
£7. This Six-fold advance, a pretty stiff
price to pay for the joy of dealing with the
foreigner, is bad enough. But the failure
of the Commonwealth Government to take
any steps to remedy this state of affairs by
encouraging Australian industries is worse
still. Hughes and Pearce keep proclaim-
ing that their eyes have been opened. But
their hands hang helpless. No doubt they
mean well. Take in proof of that a recent
speech by Hughes :
Germany came to this country and received a
hearty welcome. In our foolish trustfulness we gave
her of our best. She spied out the fruitfulness of the
land and gradually wormed her way into the inmost
citadels of trade and industry. The best of Aus-
tralian trade has fallen into her predatory hands.
But our eyes have been opened. We see the danger ;
the way to safety is not less plain. The job in
front of the business men of Australia is to attack
German trade and destroy its every vestige. They
must see that Germany has no trade in Australia
from now onwards. Every fibre and every tentacle
of the accursed cancer must be cut 0ut.... Whatever
legislation is necessary, so far as it is within the
power of the Commonwealth, will, you may be sure,
be passed....
Stirring words. What of actions? Words
without deeds are like faith without works.
Hughes has not added one brick to the
tariff wall. Surely the job in front of the
politician is to carry out his election pledges.
“Whatever legislation is necessary. .. .will be
passed.” When? Why keep putting it off?
There is no virtue in delay. Consistency,
however, is not Hughes’s forte. To a depu-
tation of chemists (8/11/’l5) he said:
“You want me to allow you to sell these
I aspirin tablets imported before the war]
in your pharmacy. Yet you say they are
German products. I will not be a party to
any such desire. You will not get a license
from me to sell German aspirin. I hoped you
would not sell it. Indeed, if it became neces-
sary, I would have a law passed to prevent
it. Yet inside a month the very Govern-
ment of which Hughes is Prime Minister
sold by auction through its Customs Depart-
ment a shipment of German drugs from the
detained enemy steamer Apolfla. Wherein
lies the difference between a chemist selling
German-made aspirin and the Government
selling 4000 tablets of German-made acid
acetyl, sal.?
Billjim and His Figtree.
In the matter of these farms for soldiers — -
the great scheme Australia was going to
have for settling her returned heroes on the
land and all the rest of it —is there any-
thing doing? If there is The Bulletin
knows at least 75 men back from Gallipoli
who haven’t got farms. On going to find
out where the farms were on which a man
in khaki could convert himself into a cocky,
they mostly drew a blank or copious assur-
ances that the matter was being gone into
by J. C. Watson and various Ministers for
Lands. Surely it is time there was some-
thing to show for Watson’s efforts — some-
thing more filling, that is, than the withered
apple-bush which he smote down the other
day when he went out and helped clear a
suburban farmlet. It was very good of
Watson, of course, and he was probably all
the better for the exercise. But what about
the real thing? Billjim is beginning to
come back by hundreds. Later on he will be
coming home in thousands. Land settle-
ment is to Australia one of the things that
touches the national life in a very definite
way. Promises have been made that on the
return of our soldiers from the Front land
will be available to such of them as care to
join the limited army of hayseeds. Up to
date one or two persons have expressed their
intention of giving land for settlement by
soldiers —about enough to provide a score or
so of farms. Also two or three Govern-
ments have announced that if they can bor-
row more cash they will someday build rail-
ways to somewhere, and then the soldier
can settle and start to earn his keep in
about four years. Further, the owners of
some very highly-improved property have
offered to sell to the State, which to them
would be good business, for the man who
can convert present land values into State
securities, free from various taxes, is doing
something in the way of personal economy
anyhow. _ So when one comes to look into it,
all there is to see is a continued absence of
the “scheme” of settlement that was glibly
-talked about six months ago, along with a
firm determination to do nothing except with
borrowed cash. For the issue of deben-
tures. to landowners is merely another way
of raising a loan, and if the seller announces
that he will present a certain percentage of
the purchase price to the patriotic funds —
some of them are doing this— that
means that even those funds will be
swelled, by State borrowings. Of course
the politicians are writhing in the midst of
this land settlement business in a state of
flustered impotence. But do any of them or
Watson seriously believe that they are going
to do anything worth while for the soldiers
or for the people of Australia by borrowing
to buy land? Or do they honestly think
they are doing a fair thing by Billjim by
dropping him on to a farm with a mortgage
on it as high as his chin, and then fixing the
price at which he shall sell his pig and his
pound of butter? Putting aside the national
interests in this matter —a mighty hard thing
to do—it looks like playing ifc pretty low
down on Billjim to muddle along in this
fashion, and make a stalking horse of him.
The simple question to answer is: Is there
suitable land near existing railways? If
there isn’t, this is an absurdly over-estimated
country. If there is, then the problem is
merely to make that land available for settle-
ment. . If the man who holds it isn’t using
it, or is using it only for sheep, then Bill-
jim must have it if he wants it. On the
other hand, if sheep are more important than
Billjim (and we must make up our minds
about this for good), then the recruiters
had better leave Billjim alone and turn to
the wethers for national defence.
—
The figures on the subject are always worth
having a look at. Carried up to the end
of November, the latest available, they
show that for the five months from July 1
Australia’s trade moved this way :—■
Imports. Exports.
Goods .. .. £33,158,247 £23,049,748
Gold .. .. 221,189 8,203,550
£33,379,436 £31,253,598
The increase of imports (other than gold)
over the previous year’s figures amounted to
£4,435,787. The increase in the value of
exports was £1,886,152. On the exchange
(still excluding gold) the country was
£10,108,499 short. To hold up the balance
a bit, twice as much gold was shipped away
as we produced. To square the rest of the
bill the country furiously borrowed millions
from London, and then added multitudinous
millions to the load by internal war bor-
rowings. What view the “responsible states-
men” of Australia are taking of all this is, of
course, a mystery. Apparently it doesn’t
matter. Still it is good for this young
democracy to know that we have 14 Houses
of Parliament, seven Governors, 800 politi-
cians and the Norton Griffiths syndicate.
A sidelight was cast on the Totalisator
question in I key Mo’s remaining strongholds
by the action of the Federated Book-
makers’ Association in Victoria. This de-
lectable body threatened to “strike” at three
Melbourne suburban race meetings unless
veteran Kelly Maitland was dismissed
from his position of handicapper for the three
clubs, and the trouble was only ended without
a “strike” by the official’s resignation. He
is 77 years of age, and he desires to live at
peace with his old friends and acquaintances,
the “books,” for the rest of his life. The
F.B.A. complained that Maitland had laid
his handicapping open to suspicion by putting
money on some of the horses —which state-
ment, if true, is no sort of evidence that
he ever treated a horse too leniently with
the intention of backing it. Handicappers
are expected to refrain from backing their
fancies; but as judges of a horse’s “form”
after the appearance of the weights they are
in the same position as experienced punters
in general. A horse that seems too lightly
treated will be backed at a short price, and
handicappers, with their constant experience
of the unexpected in racing, are the last
people on the turf to gamble heavily on hot
favorites. So it was hard to see how the
alleged speculations of Maitland, the handi-
capper, could have been specially injurious
to the men who lay the odds. Horse-
owners* might fairly band together against
an unjust handicapper if they thought they
suffered from one, which apparently they do
not. But the parasites who merely lay the odds
are not interested in that way at all. The
whole explanation of their threat lies in
the fact that the Bookmakers’ Association
waxes saucy in its strength. Having sub-
scribed thousands of pounds to their mysteri-
ous defence fund, and having thereby blighted
the public’s hope of getting a Tote Bill
through Parliament, the combined parasites
reckon themselves strong enough to take the
offensive. Their successful attack on old
Kelly Maitland may encourage them to
demand the dismissal of a starter or a judge.
And in order that these unproductive
citizens may continue to do all these
things, and block a much-needed social
reform, and live on the fat of the
land, and make a horrible din at places of
public recreation, the Government continues
to deny the insolvent public hospital the
assistance that a silent, honest, occasional
tote would give them. The scandal stinks
the more now that the N.S.W. Government
has attempted to save its face by imposing a
paltry tax on bookmakers’ tickets.

“E.C..T.” on applying for a job:—
I suppose that the largest employer at present in
the Commonwealth is the Defence Department. Now
I have many times applied for jobs. In most cases
the position has been filled; but the employers,
realising that they might be requiring a man in the
future, have always taken my name and address and
details of qualifications. Well, a few days back the
Defence Department advertised for engineers for
active service. Even my enemies do not accuse me of
boasting when I call myself an engineer. So, in
spite of being a married man with a family, I took
the morning off and proceeded to Moore Park (Syd-
ney) to offer to do my bit. Upon arrival I was told
they were full up. Good ! Nothing could be better.
However, I asked if they would medically examine
me, and so on, that I might be called upon when
required. No—red-tape prohibited! Not even a
note was taken of my address, even though, as I told
them, I had had much previous service in the Engi-
neers in England. By the expenditure of a few
minutes’ work in taking down details they could
have known where to put their, hands on three
trained and willing men (there were two others besides
myself who received the same reception). What am
I to do? Take the morning off each day and go to
Moore Park on the off-chance that the Department
will eventually require an engineer—and then, per-
haps, after wasting all that time, be turned down by
the medical officer? Or do you think I’d better enter
Parliament and form an engineers’ thousand? But
isn’t it heart-breaking?
♦
Professor Laby, of the Melbourne Uni-
versity, has given a tip to Prime Minister
Hughes in regard to the foundation of the
proposed Australian institution for industrial
research. The Prime Minister says he in-
tends to secure in England “such men as
upon inquiry it would seem that we are
unable to obtain in Australia.” Laby, Aus-
tralia’s most eminent scientific-research per-
son, advises delay in selection. His idea is
that the present is the worst possible time
for picking up scientists in Britain. There
being a number of important posts to
be filled in that country when the war is
over,' it seems certain the British front-
ranker won’t give up his chance in the home
lottery for a position in Australia. This
means that if we wait until the Kaiser is
hanged we shall have to be satisfied with
left-overs. But Baby’s idea is that it is
better to have a selection of left-overs than
practically no selection at all. But there
is another course which Australia might
follow—to choose the best Australian
scientists available in the particular direc-
tions in which more light is required, and
send them abroad for study. If this should
be done Australia wouldn’t have to wait till
the war ends to start her researches. She will
be doing it the moment the Australian scien-
tist leaves home in order' to bring foreign
knowledge to the aid of Australian condi-
tions. _ No matter how eminent the foreign
scientist it will take him years to know Aus-
tralian resources and requirements as the
home-grown young man knows them already.

‘'Analyst” : A friend who has a pri-
vate laboratory and has more than
dabbled, since the war began, in local
substances likely to yield dye-stuffs of
commercial value, reckons that in grass-
tree gum he has struck a three-streak
patch. Grass-tree gum, he says, yields to
simple and comparatively inexpensive treat-
ment the following: A good union yellow
dye; a greenish-yellow dye for wool, fast
to washing and milling; and an exceedingly
fast golden-brown on cotton, wool and silk.
Used with hsematin (logwood extract), jet-
black results may be obtained on all three.
Further research work has proved to him
and to me that this remarkable gum also
yields picro compounds of high explosive
value. German scientists discovered this
seme time ago and shipped from Australia
quantities of the gum for the alleged purpose
of varnish making. The Hun is for ever
first where natural resources are to be ex-
ploited ; the Australian a bad last because he
refuses to see that under his hand there is
everything worth caring about. Grass-tree
gum is just the same -old excrescence on the
tree, and even if it might be useful what’s
the use of bothering? There will be plenty
of dye to be got after we have licked Ger-
many ! Wheh the Austrian and German
tannin-bark forests threatened to peter out
and hemlock-tannin extract in the U.S.A.
couldn t supply the demand, German scien-
tists came over to study , the Australian flora
and found there was much tannin in the
land, and it was good, from the golden

German capital was getting ready to exploit
in German interests large tracts of Queens-
land brigalow for tannin-extract purposes
The man in the street knows little or nothing
of such happenings, and the man in power
cares less. A million loan suits him best.


The “TRIAD” for January
A Magazine Always Somehow Different.
If you like straight opinions served hot. if you’re still half in love with the
truth.
If you’d hear of some things on the spot that are shocking to wisdom and youth.
If you know a good thing by its bite, if you’re saddened by bedroomy plays,
If you’re honest from morning till night, and loathe all the shams of these days.
If you're lured by poetical skill and love the most ticklesome prose.
If of joy you would drink your whole fill and hate all the hypocrites’ glose.
Be you spinster, fiancee or wife, bold satyr or coy hamadryad,
You will taste the best sweet of your life when you sit down to read this month’s
Triad.

Another Evacuation under Abdul's
Nose.
Eithee the Turk is a somnolent, casual sort
of person and his German officers turn in
early o’ nights. o~ John Bull has discov-
ered something in a General's uniform with
the craft of the Devil. If neither of these
things hits the boll's eye, the real explana-
tion of recent events at Gallipoli has not
yet been opened for inspection. As Abdul
has hitherto shown himself a fairly wide-
awake sort of customer, and was in perma-
nent residence very close to his enemy, the
story that he woke op in the morning to
find*that the Anzaes had disappeared and a
few davs later discovered that the army at
Cape Holies had also sneaked away, suggests
one of the queerest occurrences in the history
of war. Of course things remotely resem-
bling this have been done before, as. for
instance, when Brother Boeb used to roll
np his blanket and silently steal from the
landscape. But to remove two armies that
were hanging on to positions within a few
yards of the enemy, and to place them on
the deep blue sea. every movement being
under shell-fire, and to do it all without the
loss of so much as one man. seems not so
much the achievement of the impossible as
the accomplishment <>f the unthinkable. The
paradox of Gallipoli is amazing. Here was
a position judged vulnerable to attack by
sea. The judgment proved to be wrong, and
after losing several warships the navy
hauled off. Then the place was considered
open to conquest with the bayonet. After
a quarter of a million men had gone down
one way and another that. too. was found to
be a mistake, and the Peninsula was reckoned
a good place to leave. According to Asquith
enormous loss was expected to be the price
of evacuation. Yet the armies were with-
drawn without any loss. All of which means
that everybody was wrong about everything
in connection with Gallipoli. Anyhow, the
men are away. That is the main thing.
The next thing, apparently, to be looked for
is a leap by the associated Hnns on
Salonic-a: bnt ’whether Billjim is waiting
for him thereabouts is carefully obscured.
In the interval the Bear is violently hitting
up Yon Mackexsex at the southern end of
the Russian line and Yon Hindexbubg is
trying to deliver a punch amidst the snow and
frost in the North. As for the rest —welL
Uncle Sam is waiting for evidence to show
that the Persia was torpedoed, and mean-
time is asking Britain not to interfere with
its parcel-post trade with neutrals,
the Kaiser is reported to be in the
grip of a horrible throat affliction, the
value of German money and securities is
slumping, and Britain is taking on modified
conscription without as much of a kick as
Labor and other hide-bound Conservatives
expected. Incidentally the war is raging on.
and blood is pouring out. and cash is being
blewed at a rate which makes c-haos a cer-
tainty for someone —and the end is a long
way round fifteen corners.

When Bismabck was making np the Ger-
man Empire he forgot the little State of
Liechtenstein in the Alps, which had for-
merly been part of the German Confedera-
tion. This seemed good luck for the people
of the small mountain principality, who went
along quite pleasantly on their own. Hav-
ing abolished poverty and crime, they pointed
out to their Prinee that he ought to pay for
his right of sovereignty, and thus practically
abolished taxes also. So joyous, however,
did they find the general business of aboli-
tion that they abolished military service and
trrsted to their mountains and the difficulty
ol pronouncing the name of their State to
protect them against any invasion of their
rights. A few years ago there were 4587
men in the little place; but small as this
number seems, four thousand armed men on
an Alp might hold their own indefinitely
against the world. Now Austria, hunting
round desperately for recruits, has discovered
the hardy band of mountaineers who
wouldn't drill for their own defence and
has added them and their State to the Aus-
trian Empire. It is an awful example of
what may happen to any mother who didn’t
raise her son to be a soldier. The men of
I.ieehenstein who might have stood rifle in
hand for the defence of their own mountains
are forced at the bidding of a stranger to
march in the doubtful company of Turk and
Kaiser in campaigns against decency. Yet
there are fools who still assert that lack of
war preparation means peace.
The pub strike in the Northern Territory
petered out last week, and the wet season was
ushered in with a blaze of g (hie I lory. After
10 weeks drought the population assured
itself that it had no desire to see the Curse
any more, and was thinking about memorial-
ising Hughes to turn the State pubs into
munition works, when suddenly the news
spread that Ermyntrude the waitress and
Bill the barman were back at the old
address. Then the population rushed to see
if it was dinkum and, finding that it was,
unanimously remained to scoff and pay.

Judging by the success of “Twin Beds at
the Sydney Criterion, which success comes
two-thirds from bed and the other 33-3 per
cent- from archiepiseopal ad., the only thing
left for the aspiring playwright is to concoct
a tragedy in which the hero is an archbishop
and the three acts take place in the bath-
room of the palace- Think of the producers
aesthetic delight in staging an artistic bath-
room with a practical shower! And how
elevating to observe an archbishop under the
shower T Godliness and cleanliness hand in

hero would keep on his apron.

SYDNEY TIVOLI "FOLLIES."
Burglar Cannot rob a Policeman Rego of his
hard-earned wages.
Branscombe’s Green Dandies (he’s got
them all the colors of the rainbow around
Australia, from Perth to Manly, while some
others are generally brightening up Maori-
land) have settled down as a steady-going
concern at the Garden Theatre (Sydney).
They provide an entertainment distinct from
any other in the city, well varied, and irre-
proachable in its morals; while the open-air
conditions, after the swelter and perspira-
tion of enclosed theatres these parboiled
nights, are a treat to the citizen who pads
the hoof in search of comfortable amusement
The chief oddness of “The Lady of Lyons”
nowadays is in its simple honesty and direct-
ness of purpose. There is no padding in the
old thing. The play opens with a front
cloth scene, where two men walk on and give
the whole plot away in a few words. After
explaining their position towards the name
character they plan her humiliation, or rather
Mr. Beauseaut plans it and Mr. Glacis falls
in w nh the idea. The plot is the simplest
ot frauds perpetrated on the simplest of people,
and all the same old specious excuses can be
offered for its success. The only outsider—
Colonel Damas—who suspects the fraudu-
lent of Melnotte s title, wastes no time iu
arriving at his conclusion. He gets there
right away, and pushes the plot along faster
than ever. The people talk on stilts, as a
rule, but they talk straight to the point
instead of uttering irrelevaneies in a round-
about way. l,k e the people in modern comedy.
And uearlj all the characters get oue chance,
or many, to say somethin* forcible. The
sentiment of this good acting play is demt-
cratic, the satire is anti-snobbish, the allu
-ions to French militarism hare a modern
interest, and, considered as a curio, "The
Lady” was worth reviving. Julius Knight
in the glory part of Claude looks elderly at
times and sounds elderly in his elocution, but
he has the heroic air and the pleasing per-
sonality and the experience that count.
Eardley Turner makes a capital Damas and
Maggie* Knight an excellent widow Melnotte.
By ram. Greenaway. Kirby. Sty an and Miss
W ilton are at home in their respective parts.
As for Miss Dorothy humming as Pauline—
a star character with emotional actresses for

ing but exceedingly fair to see.

“Under Fire,” at Melbourne Royal, is doing
fairly well, thanks to the bonzer bomb ex-
plosion in trench 27 and a few other con-
vincing items, not forgetting Atholwood’s
Belgian innkeeper. A tonieal war drama
which goes no further than the German ad-
vance on Paris was hardly likely to make a
great noise in the land. But the bonzer
bomb creates an admirable disturbance of
its kind. Also the American journalist who
wanders aimlessly through the play deserves
honorable mention for not being in the least
heroic. He*s the only non-heroic Yankee
journalist The Bulletin ever met in a
Yankee drama.
** * *
"Mother Goose” shows no signs of wearing
out its welcome at Her Majesty’s (Melb.).
Two or three days last week the weather did
its best to keep a perspiring populace away
from the panto, nevertheless the populace
rolled up as before, and expressed an extra
volume of sympathy for Maggie Dickinson
and the ballet.
The short revival of “The Glad Eye” at
Melbourne King's is giving the populace
another chance to inspect the two dissolute
husbands. Bocard and Polynac, and the de-
mure little KikL who would not behave.
KikL who represents an improper passage
in the life of Polynac and brings a little spice
into the existence of an elderly spook-raiser
and his degraded medium, is played as be-
fore by Ethel Dane with all her old capacity
for embellishing innocent words with a smile
of delicate indecorum. Shelford and Ford
are the jaunty benedicts who affect a fond-
ness for air travel to conceal their disgrace-
ful adventures, and later become an unsus-
pected and agitated audience to the capers
of Kiki in the Galipaux library. Their wild
knockabout business in the gallery of that
apartment earned them at least a shower-
bath in the sweltering atmosphere of Satur-
day night Ford’s by-play is especially
laughable on his tragic discovery of the fact
that little Kiki. far from being an uncut
primer of Love, is something like a well-
thumbed classic in its literature. As in the
first production of the farce, Frank Bradley
conducts Galipaux’s excursions into the
occult, the medium. Chausette. being a
humorous humbug whom Edward Landor
converts into a sallow-fac-ed gentleman with
a bottomless thirst. As Ferdinand Floquette.
Thos. E. Tilton is a mournful vision of a
stagey Frenchman; and juiss Hellmric-h does
justice to only the dress allowance of Mrs.
Boc-ard. Miss Dorothy Hastings has a
gentler touch as Mrs. Polynac, and Miss
Hardwick has all the physical appointments
for the flirtatious damsel Juliette. Next
Saturday "Who’s the Lady?" will be staged
again for six nights.

The bill at the Tivoli in Melbourne suffers
from too much ’Murkan humor just now.
Mary Elizabeth is back-talking, and sing-
ing the same flabby song, and recit-
ing the same lot of poor little jokes
in the same confident twang as of yore.
Walter James, “the King of the Laff Trust.”
has abated nothing of his wearisomeness:
Barton and Ashley’s new sketch, entitled
“Some Doctor.” is a labor in vain; and “Two
Interesting American Fellows” are not ab-
sorbingly so. The rest of the bill is devoted
chiefly to musical talent of one sort or
another, the sorts of Mrs. Slapoffski and
Jacques rintel being the best.
* * * *
The appearanc-e of the Stanhope co. in a
new absurdity entitled “This is the Life"
is the only change of note at Melbourne
Bijou. The piece is a feeble type of musical
burlesque and would look less like an alter-
cation between Stanhope. Les Bates and
Miss Ruby Kennedy if the other people in
the show had more to do. Stanhope, how-
ever. is the greatest offender: he talks too
much aud also affects an outrageous simian
make-up that tempts this paper to throw a
bag of peanuts at him. In the first part the
strident humor of Miss Armytage and the
baritone warbling of Hine continue to be
conspicuous features.

"Xhe Ross.” Hoyt's top-liner in Mel-
bourne last Saturday, is a solemn assurance
to the effect that a crusty, consummate
“grafter” of the Yankee type can have the
heart of a noble philanthropist beating in
his breast. "The Iron Master.” presumably
derived from Ohnet’s novel, was the next
best item, while the first series of "The
Black Box” proved to be an original blood-
freezer most acceptable to the multitude on
a sultry evening. The funniest film on the
hill, however, was a war item showing
French soldiers cutting the buttons off the
pants of German prisoners in order to ruin
their chances of escape.
THE LADY OF LYONS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Claude Melnotte, the peasant-born,
Wrote love-lays to Pauline,
She turned the lover down with s»rn,
Which roused the poet's spleen.
The girl, comparatively “great."
Despised the boy of lowly state,
Whilst he felt fit to be the mate
Of Beauty’s haughty Queen.
Claude came anon in princely guise
To woo the proud Pauline;
His verse she did not note despise—
He wrote her reams of luscious lies.
And Oh! she thought his princely eyes
The finest she had seen!
The peasant had a honeyed tongue,
And bee-like on his lips she hung;
She felt, as to his arm she clung.
Comparatively mean —
In fact, a mere colleen.
When to his humble domicile
Claude brought his wife at e’en
(The dupe of his revengeful guile),
The anger of Pauline
Turned soon to yearning for her lord;
She would have shared his bed and board;
The spoofed young maiden now adored
The prinee he might have been.
But Claude preferred to go abroad
And let his fond Pauline
Yearn daily for hei lawful lord
Who’d vanished from the scene,
Until he could, with valiant sword,
Cut out his Past unclean.
He won renown ’midst war’s alarms,
And then returned to claim her charms;
So she fell limply in his arms
And whispered, “All serene.”
The play will die, the moral live
And still be fresh and green;
The proudest woman can forgive
A fraud, howevei mean,
That’s played on her by oue whose kiss
Has realised her dream of bliss ;
Fraud is the fooa of love, dear Miss,
If appetite be keen.
All men are Claude Melnotte in this,
All women are Pauline.
VICTORIA.

England in June last, and now Aus-

Sixty-eight per cent, of the World's
Buying Markets are closed, the result was
inevitable, and prices (except for certain
sizes for America) are low, so that pur-
chasing now is an investment.
Our Amsterdam House sent to us large
quantities of diamonds, bought months
ago from Belgian refugees, and as we
had under an agency to make an enormous
turnover, we are continuing our plan of
selling diamonds (wonderfully well bought), at a mere oommission on the landed cost.
Commissions pay when the turnover is great enough.
Diamonds have never been lower than we are now offering them at.

ran their season up to the last moment be-
fore fleeing to catch the American steamer
at Sydney. Hebrew humor pervades the
King’s, too, Mack and Leblanc filling half of
the programme with a jolly turn built round
their work. The others may be Spaniards
or whatever they please, according to the
loosely-constructed story, but always the
Jewish pair butt in. Other items at this
house are Marvelle’s hard-working cockatoos,
and Abdy’s dogs—especially the hound who
masquerades as a horse. At West’s Pictures
“John Glayde’s Honor,” with cricketer C.
A. Smith as John ; at Wondergraph, Birtles’s
Australian travel-films. But a roasting New
Year gives the best chances of all to the
open-air shows, so Waller’s “Ideals” and
Branscombe’s “Dandies,” both off North
Terrace, have done big business right along.
Said the sergeant affably to him in the
bar, “You’re a fine strapping young fellow.
You’d look just the thing in khaki.
Married?” “No,” says the other. “Any-
one dependent on you?” “No.” “Well,
why don’t you enlist?” “No chance!” says
the bloke. “7 ain’t going to well inter-
fere.”
A lot of good, foaming indignation which
might easily be used to give departmental
wheels a shove is running to waste in bars
and other places. Any returned soldier who
can’t get his pay or is otherwise suffering
from departmental slowness or muddle is
always sure of a drink and some consolatory
bad language from a patriotic sympathiser ;
but there it ends. Occasionally the warrior
with a legitimate grievance finds a practical
hustler who is willing to utilise some of his
own time and whatever influence he can
command to get things adjusted between the
Commonwealth and the man who has served
it. But he is more likely to find a mere
giver of drinks and small loans. If there
was in existence an Honorary Corps of
Departmental Ferrets and Bogged-wheel
Shovers, more of these helpful citizens
might reveal themselves and help to expedite
the nation’s business. It seems as likely an
outlet for male patriotism as Red Crossing
is for the knitting-bag sex.
“D.S.F.” I don’t doubt “F.N.T.” (B.

nifying glass to work on the label of his
“Australian-made mustard” tin (if there is a
tin), and make sure it doesn’t say “Made
in England for So and So.” If he buys
loose mustard I bet the grocer pulls his
patriotic leg. There is no difficulty about
milling mustard here, but the hair in the
soup is that the mustard seed is raised in
Kent, England, and when imported in bulk
seems to suffer from mat de mer on the trip.
One good Australian firm in Melbourne,
which mills everything possible on the spot,
used to make big quantities of the sirloin’s
assistant, but owing to the trouble above-
mentioned was reluctantly compelled to let
J. Bull do it. So here’s a job for our Agri-
cultural Departments: find out the ideal
place in Australia for growing mustard
seed.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Genevieve Ward, who was acting in Mel-
bourne and Sydney before most present-day
Australian playgoers were born, was booked
for re-appearance at the St. James’s, Lon-
don, on New Year’s Day, George Alexander,
1 who runs that fashionable playhouse, de-
scribing the new four-act comedy, “The
Basker,” with which he proposed to inaugu-
rate 1916, and asked about his leading
lady, remarked :—-
“Ah, there comes something of a surprise, but I
think you will all agree I, could not have made a
better choice. The role, because of its complex
character, is rather difficult to fill. Still, I think I
have found an ideal representative in Miss Genevieve
Ward. Theatrical biographies give her age, I know,
as 77, but if she doesn’t prove the youngest in the
cast I shall be vastly mistaken.”
“The Basker” is a four-act comedy written
by Mrs. Clifford-Mills, part authoress of
the successful “Where the Rainbow Ends.”
Alexander sums it up as a “bright,
breezy, cheery” piece; which sounds like a
new departure late in life for the stately
and dignified Genevieve.

“Monkbarns” : Salvini, the just-dead trage-
dian, made no secret of his disappointment
at Ristori marrying the Marquis Grille.
Ilistori and Salvini appeared to be made for
each other. Long associated professionally
they seemed as Romeo and Juliet, and both
were so very respectable. However, Ristori
gave herself to the Marquis, and had to work
to keep him. The finest performance ever
known in Italy was at the last Dante cen-
tenary, when “Francesca da Rimini” was
presented by a cast including Ristori, Salvini,
Kossi and the elder Majeroni, brother of
Eduardo, well known in Australia. Salvini
was best in Othello; beside him there were
only two_ great Moors in the century—
Edward Kean and Brooke.
“Melb ”: Knight as Claude Melnotte has
as good a card as he can play, in default of
more Zendas or Superbuses. It is my
opinion that “The Lady of Lyons” will out-
last “The Silver King.” Of course, it is
highfalutin’ stuff, but so is Homer’s. The
critics had agreed that Lytton could not
write a play. So they damned his “La Val-
liere,” with Macready as Bragelone. Says
Macready: “That’s only because you put
your name to it. Try something anony-
mous, and you will be hailed as the Coming
Man.” In six weeks Lytton wrote “The Lady
of Lyons.” On the first night he made a
great speech in the House of Commons, and
then hurried to Covent Garden, where he
arrived just before the curtain fell on an
overwhelniing success, mainly due to Helen
Faucit. To the generation before last “The
Lady of Lyons” was the most popular drama
on the English, American and Australian
stage. Its first Melbourne performance was
in the Queen’s Theatre, 1845, by Coppin’s
company from Launceston, on its opening
night—Melnotte, Young; Damas, Rogers;
Beauseant, Thomson ; Glavis, Coppin ; Paul-
ine, Mrs. Coppin. Next night this aston-
ishingly good co. put on “The School for
Scandal.”
Arthur Russell, the dentist who started
Hoyt’s Pictures, was fairly on the road to
wealth when death took him from his enter-
prises. The showman tooth-doctor cut up
worth £27,000, which goes to his own folk.
“Fax” : The Goose in this year’s William-
son panto is a very unthankful job for an
“animal impersonator” to struggle with.
Albert Felino, who gets inside the part,
has an elaborately feathered outfit, and
he manipulates the bird’s eyes and
mouth for all they are worth as panto
effects. But they are not worth much.
There’s very little fun to be got out
of a goose impersonation. Nor is there
humor in the idea of an old he-woman seri-
ously imploring the goose to lay her a beauty
egg, and getting the stodgy bird to accom-
pany her to a magic pool where she can
wash away her wrinkles. The goose seems
an awful fool when it isn’t an awful bore.
A comic donkey or Whittington’s cat or a
monkey can be the life of a panto at times,
but the monstrosity that lays golden eggs is
a very slow-going concern. Felino’s work is
very good in its way, no doubt. He’s neces-
sary to the silly panto story. But he’s
only a necessary evil.
Portraits of Australian army officers are
displayed just now’ in the vestibule at Mel-
bourne Royal. Seeing that “Under Fire” is
being played on the stage, a photo of a man
who gets in touch with the real thing seems
more appropriate to the occasion than a
picture of a fat mummer waving a property
sword and blowing the bubble reputation
with his own mouth.
“Ho Ho” : Having made the foolish asser-
tion that “a great proportion of present-day
playgoers belong to the Stinking Fish bri-
gade” “Mid-Channel” endeavors to save himself
with the assistance of that old and discredited
accomplice, the red herring. I mentioned a
number of instances in which Australian
plays of only moderate merit were success-
ful. “Mid-Channel” takes one of these —
“On Our Selection” —and shouts (B.
30/12/’l5) : “Only those citizens who can
laugh at a parson fleeing from a broken egg
of many days, or five men with ropes ex-
tracting Dad’s loose tooth, or the love-mak-
ing of Dave, get value for their money.”
Exactly. As I pointed out. “Mrs. Wiggs of
the Cabbage Patch,” a much better play of a
similar type, was received with comparative
coldness, but the Australian piece was wel-
comed with whoops of joy and a rush to the
box-office. Does this suggest that local
playgoers belong to the Stinking Fish bri-
gade? What reason has “Mid-Channel” for
supposing that a better class of Australian
play, if staged , would not be similarly well
received? When the premier Australian
management has staged a high-grade Aus-
tralian comedy or drama and it has been
greeted with scorn or indifference, it will be
time for “Mid-Channel” to cry Stinking Fish.
Meanwhile let him, in spite of successive
failures of plays from the Neutral States,
continue to cherish the simple faith that
“the big managements know the pulse of
their public well enough to leave this sort
of business [i.e., the phenomenally lucrative
business of “On Our Selection”] to others”!
From London :
Negro minstrelsy has broken out in a fresh
place. The Garrick Theatre, built by IV. S. Gil-
bert, and bequeathed by him to a theatrical benevo-
lent society, after certain life interests are termi-
nated, has deserted the legitimate for the current
craze of revue. Its first venture—“ Looking Round”
—winds up with a reproduction of the performance
of the Moore and Burgess Minstrels who occupied
St. James’s Hall for a continuous half-century, and
to whom George Coppin made in vain a very hand-
some offer for an Australian tour. Even the Times
found it “sentimentally interesting” in recalling
memories of a form of entertainment that was prodi-
giously popular in former years. It was exceedingly
popular in Australia, too, and might become so again
if anything like the old talent were available. But
where are the equals of Harry Kelly, Frank Hussey,
Tom Buckley, Tom llainford, Beaumont Read, Horace
Bent, the Coghills, and a score of other favorite
burnt-cork artists of the days when our hair was
curly ?
“0.K.” on some bygone whiskers :
It is hard to believe there were any clever smart-
looking men 40 years ago. They wore curly side-
whiskers and large crops of oily hair on their heads,
and vast, chest-protecting scarves, and collars cut
away from the neck, and unspeakable hats. A stage
annual, published in 1879, is illustrated with photos,
of many actors and writers of the time. They are
distressing reminders of that dark age in English
fashions when Oscar Wilde’s aestheticism was strug-
gling to get ugliness down. A portrait of W. S.
Gilbert is about the saddest reminder of them all.
His mutton-chop whiskers are connected with his
moustaches, and his style is that of the shopwalker.
Humor and satire seem impossible to him. Clement
Scott has bits of stodgy whisker extending to the
lower level of his ears. H. J. Byron, who was one
of the bucks of the period, has a bushy moustache
measuring at least 12in. from end to end, and a
scarf that fills the whole of the big gap in his vest.
Henry Irving, in profile, makes the only picturesque
photo, in the annual. His story has a bearing on
Julius Knight’s latest revival of “The Lady of Lyons”
at Melbourne Princess’s. Irving tells of how, when
he was a very young actor (in 1858), he arranged to
give a reading of “The Lady of Lyons” at Linlith-
gow Town Hall. His manager, being promised half
the profits, billed the town profusely, and they ex-
pected a big crowd. As a matter of fact, there were
no profits. Nobody came. So Irving and his partner
shut the door and silently slunk away.
“Harrison O.” : At pantomimes or musi-
cal-comedy shows the peanut circle is the
only part not made the object of unwelcome
attention from those on the stage. The
stallite suffers most in this respect. lie it
is who has an electric torch directed at his
bald cranium by a serio-chronic who wishes
to know, “Who’s your lady friend?” when
the person with him is not a friend at all,
but his wife. He it is also who is made a
target for the personal gibes of comedians
too ill-equipped to provide mirth off their
own bat. Further, he is always liable to be
hit in the eye by a paper streamer. In the
“Mother Goose” panto, he is attacked with
clusters of balloons attached to fishing-rotts,
to the justifiable annoyance of his favorite
barmaid, who has spent hours in arranging
her hair ; then more balloons and miniature
parachutes are dropped on him from the
roof; later a lady droops from a swing
attached to a wire hung across the audi-
torium, while he sits in gloom reflecting
that if she falls it will mean the ruin of his
boiled shirt; and finally a number of
females who are old enough to know better
run on to a plank in front of the footlights
and bombard him with balls, again wrecking
the hair which Hebe has spent the interval
in repairing. Put me, I say, among the
gods. Better a dinner of nuts where
safety is than a stalled seat and danger
therewith.
From London : The “revue” so-called gets
nearer, each week, to a succession of music-
hall turns ; also, as one critic says, to “hold-
ing the mirror up to Nature —as nearly as
the Lord Chamberlain will allow.” The lady
who is “attired with a daring inadequacy
and little else” is the one who scores best.
The war is the cause. Mrs. Grundy is “tak-
ing the count” nowadays—as witness the
frgnk discussion of war-marriages, their
cause and their result. Also, London is full
of French and Belgian amusement-caterers
and their “artists,” to both of whom the
human form largely undraped is a regular
and reliable business asset. Samples:—(l)
Song and chorus: “Glad to see you’re back.”
Principal girl’s rear view has nothing on it
above the hips except slight shoulder-straps.
(2) Two girls reading large newspapers.
Arms and legs bare; prolonged suggestion
that the paper is their only covering.
Presently they drop it, and are (of course)
found to be in brief but adequate page’s
costume. (3) Five large fashion-plates (one
of underwear) and a sixth of the “alto-
gether.” Man-milliner undertakes to produce
the living effect in each case. Through four
of the drawings in turn burst in real girls
dressed in that precise fashion. A pause;
girl in underwear bursts in through the
fifth. All attention centred on the nude.
Through that comes the comic-man ! Audi-
ence realises itself spoofed. This is as near
as we have got—so far.

POINT DUTY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Old Howler still can hold his own
When on “the Point” amongst the mummers—
A played-out, trade-worn gramophone,
With wistful eye for likely thrummers.
I met him at his post to-day ;
He hinted it was thirsty weather.
So at the pub across the way
We “quaffed the flowing bowl” together.
At least, we’d several pints of beer—
Ihe “bowl” was his poetic fiction ;
The stagey act-or will adhere
To frothy, figurative diction.
We quaffed more bowls, as by the yard
He reeled off futile retrospection,
And spouted the Immortal Bard
With histrionical inflection.
He babbled of the parts he’d played,
The dignity of his profession,
And with the hits that he had made
He added to my deep depression.
And having wrecked the counter-lunch,
He brayed of art, refinement, culture,
The while an onion he would munch,
Or gobble meat like some old vulture.
Just here I tried to head him off—
“ What of the war?” He stopped his prattle,
And gave a deprecative cough:
“I love a play that’s got a battle!
“They think I'm rather good,” said he,
“In some romantic soldier-story,
Ah, laddie ! I was Potts, V.C.,
The juvenile in ‘Death or Glory’ !”
I saw that he would not desist,
And thinking I would chaff him slyly,
“Go to the Front!” I said. “Enlist!
Your services they’d value highly!”
“My place is here, as is my wont.
Gadzooks!” his voice grew quite unsteady,
“Boy, I’m a star ! Me at the Front!
I’ve been there thirty years already!”

PENEOLD'S
WINES
The spectacle of a sinner repenting of
his evil courses and kicking rosy vice into
the gutter is interesting, but not always
pleasing. Charles Edward Allison got
married 28 years ago, and seven years later
he and his wife parted. Three years after
the breakaway Mr. Allison came to terms
with a Miss Lush and they dwelt together.
Two years ago he foolishly married Miss
Lush, for which the Law gave him six
months’ gaol. Returning he dwelt with Miss
Lush again, and then a baby happened,
which so satisfied liis paternal ambitions
that he promised to be a true husband and
father forever. But about here the yeast
began working, and one evening he brought
his original missus home, introduced her as
his “lawful wife,” and desired the other to
vacate the premises. It was strictly in
accordance with the Sunday-school tract,
but judging by the fact that the North Mel-
bourne Court gave Miss Lush a maintenance
order of 15s. a week for the infant instead
of the usual 7s. 6d., the beaks don’t seem
to have noticed any halo about the story.
NOT TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING.
“Splendid! In a couple of weeks you’ll be
looking better than ever you did!”
“Oh, Doctor, don’t overdo it or my husband
might expect me to help in the house-
work.”
Adelaide’s motor-’buses are on a bad
wicket. No sooner had the soldiers in camp
stopped calling them hostile because of Ger-
man-sounding names on the directorate than
the municipalities started abusing them. The
Mayor of suburban Norwood tells the papers
he is “pleased to say they have left the dis-
trict altogether,” and it is said that the. cor-
poration was going to take legal opinion
about prohibiting them or getting the right
to tax them, as in Victoria. The Mayor of
Unley, whence they still run to the city,, has
stated that motor-’bus traffic will kill in a
year an Adelaide road tha,t would ordinarily
last from 10 to 12 years. A further suggestion
is that houses along the route are suffering
from the vibration. This is, of course, only
one side of the case, and the ’Bus Co. briskly
denies about nine-tenths of the allegations.
Its weak point on the financial side is that
it is Private Enterprise up against the Muni-
cipal Trust which runs the trams, and the
thoughtful ratepayer argues that every 2d.
he hands to a ’bus may recoil on his own
head in the shape of a special rate to make
up any loss on the tramway service.

A new Anglican church has just been opened
in Port Melbourne, and thereby hangs a bit
of history. In the ’so’s the people of
Sandridge—the Liardet’s Beach of the early
days—determined to import an iron church,
just as George Coppin had imported an
iron theatre. Both buildings were made
in England, and were all ready for
erection on arrival. Coppin’s venture was
named the Olympic Theatre; the Sandridge
people’s Holy Trinity. The church lasted
longest: it was in use till a storm
recently destroyed it, and the new building
takes it place. Coppin’s “pot” was burned
down long ago.

“T. 0.1.”: Apropos “Zadkiel’s” prophecies
(B. 6/1/T6). Here is another,, of the first
’so’s :
In 1854 the Bear
The Crescent shall assail,
But if the Bull and Cock unite,
The Bear shall not prevail.
In three-score years again, I ween,
Let Islam know and fear,
The Cross shall wave, the Crescent wane,
Dissolve and disappear.
The prophet guessed right as to 1854, and
every line of the first verse came true. See-
ing that he correctly spotted big trouble
60 years later, there is very fair inducement
to hope that he continued in good prophesy-
ing order and condition till he had finished
the second spasm.

Coincidence has been playing its tricks at
Forbes (N.S.W.). One local youth, aged
70, was up a tree in his orchard collecting
fruit —or it may have been birds’-nests —
when he slipped and broke his wrist. The
previous day his brother, who is secretary
of the School of Arts, and is 75, fell in the
street —he was probably playing leapfrog—
and smashed himself in exactly the same
way. Somebody should keep a watch over
these children. Isn’t it on record that a
Countess of Desmond died at the age of 120
by a fall from a clurry tree?
“Palette” : Only in the
Christmas holidays when
the inlanders surge down
to the picnic beaches do I
see the immorally shape-
less type of home-made
bathing gowns wherein
the women used to pub-
licly wash in the modest
Long Ago. I can hardly
believe the females of
those days were the same
shape under their clothes
as these free and frank
girls who wear their legs
and curves naturally in
close-fitting wool, instead
of going decently shrouded
to their heels as their
mothers did. But the
old shrouding tradition
is kept alive by the in-
lander, and the earnest
inquirer can measure the
dreadfulness of the past
by taking a walk along
the sands when the pic-
nickers are washing. I
was out judging on New
Year’s Day and picked as
the 1916 prize-winner the
shrinking woman who
walked the crowded beach
with an ordinary white
nightgown over and cling-
ing to her dripping bath-
ing dress. In her struggle
to. be modest she uncon-
sciously achieved an effect
that would have been the
prize crumb of a high-
velocity French farce.

‘Crown and Stars” from his dugout at
Anzac:—■
Re that yarn published in the Australian dailies
(16/9/T5) concerning a Turkish girl who was cap-
tured whilst sniping, and who was alleged to have
in her possession 30 identification discs and £5O in
English money. I’ve been here six months now,
and I’m in a position to know that the lady did not
do her scalp-hunting in Gallipoli. More likely she
took up the collection at the Wassa in Cairo, where
business is conducted on old Wexford-street lines;
and the Territorial “hero” who told the story to the
open-mouthed Londoners probably got into the
casualty lists without leaving Egypt. Still, there
were evidences of the presence of one woman in the
I urkish lines. When the Anzacs captured some of
the Turkish trenches a dugout, which had obviously
been a shelter for one of the high panjandrums, was
found to contain some silk underclothing. But there
were no signs of Mrs. Turk having brought the
children with her.

“Xmas Goose” : Now that Dad Christmas
has put up the slip-panels and trudged away
down the track, we can speak safely about
him. As I saw him, he was a bloated old
huckster in frock-coat, belltopper and spats,
and the. kit-bag he carried was crammed with
the spoil he had. taken out of people’s stock-
ing». Old Christmas is butcher, baker
greengrocer, confectioner and everything else
the universal tradesman who gives away
nothing but bills. If you doubt it, look at the
price of meat—a 40 per cent, increase on
last year’s robbery. If we get much more of
it we’ll soon be cured of that full feeling
alter Christmas dinner.
A good imitation of Solomon
is decorating the Bench at
Wanganui (M.L.). The other
day three infuriated Maoris in-
vaded his temple prepared to
deliver a consignment of oratory
in an effort to get the beak to
decide who should hold a flag
that had been given to a Wan-
ganui tribe many years back.
Each of the excited brown men
reckoned he had the best claim
to hang the decayed calico in
his whare; and when the triple
cargo of metaphor had been un-
loaded everyone reckoned the
Court was up against a tough
proposition if civil war was to
be evaded. But his Worship
never turned a hair. “Each
claimant to hold the flag for
four months of each year,” was
his prompt decision, and a
three-fold smile showed that he
had hit the balance of justice.
A wondrous-strange shooting case is in
the hands of the Melbourne police. Ray-
mond Dawson killed Vera Sparks when they
were alone together, after breakfasting at
his house. He is his own accuser. He was
carrying a revolver in one hand and an
alarm-clock in the other. “I’ll shoot you,”
he said jocularly to Vera, whereupon Vera
said, in allusion to his softness of heart,
“Garn, you couldn’t shoot a maggot.” Daw-
son continued to point the revolver thinking
it was not loaded. Vera opened her mouth
as wide as possible and told him to fire
into the chasm, and Raymond the Reckless,
standing only two feet away, aimed as be
was told and pulled the trigger. Then Vera
died of a bullet in the back of the head, and
Raymond went to tell the police. So far
it seems unlikely that any amount of legal
handling will knock the bottom out of the
man’s strange case, or pick the lock on it.
Clearly the pair were lovers, and evidently
the silly girl did open her mouth wide as
though she hadn’t the least idea of getting
a bullet popped into it. Her remark about
the maggot reminds one of Louis Esson's
clever playlet, “The Woman Tamer.” When
the bloke boasts of his talent for taming
women his donah says, “Garn, you couldn't
tame white mice.”

Devilfish”; The handling of the menin-
outbreak in Tas. is a fine example of
official methods. The State Government has
proclaimed the thing a dangerously-infective
disease; and as there is an Infectious Dis-
x^rfnAr? OSp^ta l at Hobart which cost about
xlu.UuO, and is more than half empty, one
might suppose that the cases would be sent
there. Nothing of the kind—they are treated
at the General Hospital. Various comic-
opera conditions are, however, observed. The
patients and the nurses attending them are
rigidly isolated ; the nurses are not allowed
to speak to any outsider or even to write
letters. The joke is that the doctors go in
and out every day, and hustle around among
the sick meantime. It recalls that when the
disease broke out at Claremont camp the
military authorities closed the camp to visi-
tors, but the soldiers were allowed out to see
their friends on the road.

latest war regulation is that Australian

the bad luck to fall into his hands shall
be permitted to write each only one letter

only one letter, and that of the same brevity,
shall be delivered to each prisoner. It seems
a totally unnecessary outbreak of severity,
and recalls the Unspeakable’s old reputation
for refined cruelty; but of course Britain
has done the only thing possible in the cir-
cumstances and replied that the rule, having
been originated by the Turk, is no doubt
most excellent, and shall apply on both sides.

On the gentle pastime of sniping:—
Captain Wallingford, the musketry expert in-
valided to Maoriland from Gallipoli, has been telling
Tasmania’s crack rifleman, L. E. Hubbard, of the
Daily Post, something of the business in Turkey.
“Sniping,” says Wallingford, “is a kind of highly-
specialised duelling. Snipers usually ignore every-
thing but the enemy snipers. They can’t afford to
give themselves away by promiscuous shooting. A lot
of the so-called sniping on the Western Front, where
t'ie trenches are only a few yards apart, is reallv
sharpshooting. Real sniping is stalking—what the
Americans call ‘still hunting.’ Snipers hunt in
couples; one locates the enemy, the other shoots by
direction of the observer. It is simply a blessing
to have good shots to work with; with bad shots it
is Hell. Good shots make sure of a mark, shoot
quick, and watch results. Second-raters fire at any-
thing, and don’t look for results. Third-raters put
the rifle up and. let off. Bad shots don’t do any-
thing.” There is bushcraft involved in stationing
snipers. “Never station men behind a knoll; plant
them a little way down the slope facing the enemy.
The latter always fire at the ridge. Nothing attracts
so much attention as a quick movement. Therefore
conceal yourself slowly and deliberately.” And get
a little way off any outstanding object in selecting
your lair. On one occasion Wallingford had arranged
a few sandbags behind a bush. Next morning day-
light disclosed that some ass had cut down the
branch and stuck it on the sandbags. Wallingford
knew that that wouldn’t do. Keeping his head out
of sight he cautiously stretched out his hand to
remove the branch, and immediately five shots
plunked into the sandbags within a few inches of
his head. Luckily the bullets were German, with
very thin envelopes, which broke up in the sand.
But that lair had been spoiled, and was not used
again. Finally, “the Backblock man who hunts for
his dinner is good, and the Bisley crack is good, but
the best of all is the man who is both. In future
Bisley should combine a good deal of rapid with
deliberate fire, the targets should be more incon-
spicuous, and all long-range shooting should be done
with telescopic sights. Miniature shooting is an
excellent preparation, and every schoolboy should be
made to learn.”
A poor excuse is better than none, but
sometimes the article is so impecunious that
it has no rag of covering whatever. Tackled
recently with sending to Bjston and ’Frisco
«• . sa . m Ples, quotations, etc., the Melbourne
officials of the Commonwealth Button Fund
explained that they had done this in order to
check the value of the Australian-made but-
tons hitherto used. This seems playing it
rather low down, even on Uncle Sam, and it
would be interesting to know for certain if
any business would have resulted if the
lankee prices had happened to be lower
than the Australian.
“S.S.”: Here is a fact that doesn’t sound
like it. My friend got into a slow train* at
Sydney station. There was another man in
the carriage. lie
sat in a corner,
with an overcoat
collar about his
ears, studying the
Telegraph. A few
seconds before the
train started a
woman got in, and
seated herself op-
posite the Tele-
g r a p H reader.
Presently the third
person saw a look
of intense surprise
come into the
woman’s eyes. She
leaned forward, and
shook the knee of
her vis-a-vis. The
man lowered his
paper and glared at
her. His face was
even more amazed
than that of the
woman. After 30
seconds of mutual
staring the woman
gasped : “You vil-
lain! You villain!
Where have you
been all these
years?” The man
gave no answer.
The woman wept
and stormed. When
the train reached
Macdonaldtown the
man, still silent,
leaped forth and
fled for the gate.
The woman put her
head out of the win-
dow and stormed
on. She fell back
in her seat as the
train started, and
catching the eye of
my friend stam-
mered : “That man
is my husband. He
deserted me seven
years back.” “Why
did you let him get
away? You should have followed him,”
said the disinterested stranger. “How could
I?” whimpered the woman. “My ticket’s to
Newtown.”
* * * *
A little time back a grey-haired old
woman was discovered digging in a Mel-
bourne suburban cemetery. Her only imple-
ment was a bricklayer’s trowel. When
gently expostulated with she explained that
she felt she would soon need a grave, and as
she would not be in a position to pay to
have one dug she was digging it herself.
She wasn’t going to be beholden to anyone,
she said. Three weeks later a burying was
interrupted by the same little old woman,
who intervened just as the coffin was being
lowered, declaring fiercely that the grave
was hers. “And,” said she, “I pegged it out
proper, and here's my miner's right!” She
was the wife of an old Ballarat digger and
the document she displayed was over 40
years old.

One Sykes was strolling across the rail-
way line at Glenorchy (Tas.) the other
day when an express train travelling at
30 miles per hour struck him. As soon as
they could pull up the crew went back to
gather up the remains. But they didn’t
find any remains. Instead they found Sykes

From “The Oldest Inhabitant” :
Apropos Melbourne fire brigades (B. 6/l/’l6).
In the first ’so’s a fire broke out in Col-
lins-street, and great damage was done to
the belongings of a Hebrew firm. Six or
eight buildings went, and property valued at a
million sterling was destroyed. Two or three
asthmatic fire-engines gathered at the scene in answer
to the call of a bullock-bell. To a fire in Melbourne
in those days everybody turned out. On one side
was Governor La Trobe and his suite, and on the other
the Mayor and the Corporation, with the mounted
police constantly passing to and fro. After much
delay the machines were placed in front of the
burning buildings, preparatory to the arrival of that
most important accessory, water. This was brought
up in water-carts from the Yarra. Each cart
carried about 200 gallons. Backwards and forwards
they went till the last flame wa3 beaten. It was
not till years afterwards that Melbourne got a
water supply lit to cope with a big Are; before the
Tan Yean was laid on (New Year’s Day, 1858) a
big Are was a godsend to the carters, who got
almost any price per barrel they liked to ask.
THE ENEMY HAVING RETIRED
THE ADMIRING CHARMER: "And do you have
to think out strategy and things?”
THE ADMIRED ( grass-widower) : “Not since
the Missus left.”
Interned at the quarantine station at
Lyttelton (M.L.) is Samson, a brown Irish
terrier, formerly owned by tennis champion
Anthony Wilding. The dog was in the
trenches in France when Anthony was
killed, and has been sent out by friends to
the dead man’s parents in Christchurch.
The tyke was named after a daring aviator
and armored-car commander, C. R. Samson,
and was kept at a ’plane-shed in Dunkirk
for some time after Wilding’s death. Then
Commander Chilcote, of the Naval Air Ser-
vice, flew over to England with it as a
passenger. On Samson’s collar are the
words, “No. 2 Squadron, Armored Motor-
car Service.”

John P.” : In the Akaroa Public Gardens
there is a tea kiosk that heloed history along
its agitated way in Maoriland. It is the
remains of one of the blockhouses built bv
the French settlers 70 years ago. These
blockhouses were built for purposes of de-
fence, and the whole populace was expected
to rush to them when Henare called with a
consignnient of war goods and bloodthirsty
expressions. Now while you sip your tea of
a summer afternoon you can look down on
peaceful Akaroa through the loopholes in
which the pioneers thrust their firearms when
Henare began to tear the atmosphere
THE WAR OF INTERCESSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Special services of intercession were held yester-
dav. —News item.
Prayer for rain need involve no great interference
with the order of nature. — Oliver Lodge.
In old Thibet the prayer-mills grind,
The holy wheels in faith revolve ;
Large Nature does not greatly mind
The interference they involve ;
In fact, she scarcely seems to know
They operate upon her show.
Call out the Bishops! Bid the Deans,
Archdeacons, Canons all repair
To give the wicked Kaiser beans
With gusts of patriotic prayer!
Nature, her broad course set to steer,
Won’t worry if they interfere.
Across the lines the Germans keep
The Lutheran parsons’ pants are thin,
Where, kneeling in devotion deep,
They plead with Gott to let them win.
Much overtime in prayer they spend
To aid the Hun to smite and rend.
High in the places of the wind,
Above the storm and stress and death,
The vast blue sky, remote and blind,
Thrills to the strife of rising breath ;
For there the prayers must clash and meet
In strenuous bursts of holy heat.
The war of pleading swells and grows.
Archbishop’s thought and wowser’s cry
Must face the long and clamorous rows
Of prayers that march through leagues of sky ;
And in the shock and stress and strain
Words flutter earthward pierced and slain.
Advanced, forced back, the squadrons reel;
The sacred missiles flash and roar ;
Some thunderous cardinal’s appeal
Tears breaches in the ether floor.
With minor boom a Lutheran mist
Charges a cloud marked “Methodist.”
So hot the fight Heaven’s ear to win
The rival ranks can know no rest;
They haste to dig themselv.es right in.
And from their trenches war with zest.
The poison-prayers of Prussia do
Their level utmost to break through.
Call the reserves! Let all men plead!
Munitions now are needed most.
On, on the large petitions speed,
A surging and tumultuous host!
But Nature, watching front and rear,
Cares nothing how they interfere.
The wheels of old Thibet grind still,
In faith the written prayers revolve ;
Nature is heedless of the mill
And all its large remarks involve.
For shot and shell, she seems to know,
Alone can make or mar her show.

A NATION MAY BE TOO PROUD TO WRITE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In his office the bridegroom was sitting,
His honeymoon done. He was vexed.
The Huns on his flag still were spitting ;
Their murders they went on committing—
Now what in the world to do next?
“It’s useless for me to revile them,
Those Huns on my impotence gloat.
My Notes they receive, and just file them.
Now what can I do that will rile them ?
I’ve got it. I won’t write a Note.”

Concerning a recent A.I.F. recruit: —
When general-provider George Leckie, of Bacchus
Marsh, passed out in 1910, Russell Clarke followed
him as representative of the Southern Province in
the tic. Legislative Countil. Russell's election was
a sort of "by special request" a fair, and there had
ti be many- agitated eommunings behind closed
doers before he was “prevailed on.’’ For Russell
is an unobtrusive young man who had lived a
scarcely noticeable existence until the call came.
It was he, too,' and not half-brother Rupert, who had
l-eeu keeping the home-fires burning on the hearth
at Rupertswood, the ancestral Clarke grey-elephant
at Sunbury. But they talked of “duty," and the
titan rose to that bait. Which makes it easier to
un-ae-stan-s why he has gripped a can now.

Ex-Juriioe Holroyd has just died, though most people

For a generation old -Justice Molesworth sat in a
wooden shed with an iron roof on the Supreme Court
Reserve, opposite the RosseE-street police barracks.
This was called the "Vcsr" Court House; the “Old"’
Court was the riecent-looking stone building hard by.
ir which, in IS-51, Stawell. Barry and Williams sat
at the first Judges of the Supreme Court of Victoria.
But. bless you, old Judge Molesworth did not mind

men. Holroyd, before he came here, did some work
on the London wifftt press; Webb was for years
a Government shorthand writer in Victoria. A small

The terms offered make it the most attrac-

tralia. Bnt apart from that it demands
the attention of people with money, much
ot little. T: first slice .'feted a few months

c cv<xr> . £i£x': r vrt far. be.-aaee a bxsi-
ness of this sort, being with farmers, takes
a g.vHl deal >f financing. This co. therefore
didn't have enough money to do any serious
manufacturing business. For a while it
apparently did a 'it of drying and mixing
at Newcastle: lately it bought s ane blocks
at Merrylands. and has put up sheds there.
But it is still an importer, and "the present
freight rates render much of the Corpora-
tion's business impossible." This is most
unfortunate, because the chances are that
after this current good harvest the co. would
be able to very largely increase its sales and.
moreover, get cash. The thing ought to be
a big co-operative venture. Unfortunately
it 1 'scs a great deal of its co-operative
character because it paid £5OOO (in shares 1
for 11.-yseH's business. There was the fur-
ther handicap that HaseH's firm was
appointed s- sing agent at a fixed commis-
sion for a 1 -ng term of years. This agree-
ment. after being repeatedly construed in the
CO. S favor by llase.l. has now been formally
varied: but it is too complicated to allow
o? an outsider judging whether the co. or
llasell gets the better of the deal. Most
likely the co does. Still there is practically
no hope of it becoming a big operative
concern while there are proprietors' shares:
tin most the vendor conk! expect would be
a t appointment as selling agent ever a term
ot years. The co. on August 31 owed
t>V4l: its cash balances were £34>7h irs
x debts £l3Jy*N and land, plant, stock
and sundries £lOllB9. The Bclieti\ <riii
i s hopes of seeing it develop into s methinc
better.

In addition to the cash, etc., mentioned above
the ox owns a reserre fond of £20.000 in-

highly probable that stock and plant have

likely to seriously shrink in the near future
and remain shrunk for some time, the
security for the principal is far better than
most industrials offer.

Of the half-year's pr fit £150.000 was paid
in dividends —three >i a shilling each. The
expenditure includes £21.'*47 written off for
depreciation and £.2>7 written off former
expenditure on the La. Id option. Together
these amounts are within about £4500 of
the sum actually spent on new plant, and
probably rather mere than cover fair wear
and tear. The figures are better —anyway, the
profit is better —than for time past:
it results are still disappointing, especially
in view of the fact that the copper not
shipped at the dose of the previous half-
year. and for which credit was then taken
at £55. realised £S3 4s. 4d- and that the

ALUMINOFERRIC is used by the Sydney Water
Board, New South Wales Public Water Supply Depart-
ment, and many country Water Boards and graziers
for precipitating impurities and clarifying water in
reservoirs, cattle dams, etc. It is simply thrown
into the reservoir in the form of a solid cake, or
dissolved and added as a liquid. In three hours’
time the most discolored water will be as clear as
crystal. One pound will clear over 2000 gallons of
water. It is exceedingly cheap and quite harmless.

the use of one of these Sizers the saving in time
would, in a very short while, cover the small initial
cost of the machine. The machine can be dressed

quently advanced another £24.161 for emer-
gency work. This latter amount was repaid
during the past year and is shown now as

As the works and machinery cost over
£264,000, and as boring shows that there are
approximately 20.000,000 tons of workable
coal left in the mine, the State has a won-
derfully good asset for the money. It is
probable that, in spite of labor-lightening
appliances, costs will be somewhat higher
in the future than they have been ; but, even
so, long before the mine is worked out the
State will be able to see all its advances
represented by hard cash. When the
£250,000 borrowed by the State has been
repaid there is no visible reason why
another quarter of a million should not be
treated in the same way. This mine cer-
tainly ought to do more than repay the
money actually spent on it. As our inherit-
ance in the ground is used up, it seems a
fair thing to lift some of the load of debt
off the back of the little Australian.
During the past year 551,451 tons were
produced and at that rate of extraction the
known reserves will last 36 years. Under
the existing law the State mine, out of
alleged consideration for Private Enterprise,
is not permitted to sell anything to the pub-
lic except small coal or slack. The year’s
output was dealt with in this way:—-
Screened. Slack,
tons. tons.
Railways .. .. .. 322,507 11,740
Other Government services .. 11,274 1,319
Run of mine .. .. .. 8,774 195,867
Total .. .. 342,555 208,926
The selling price at the end of November
was for screened 11s. to the railways and
11s. 6d. to other departments; for slack
6s. 6d. to the railways and 7s. to others.
These rates are for coal delivered into
trucks at the pit’s mouth, “and,” the man-
ager says, “taking into consideration the
calorific value of the State mine coal as
compared with that of N. S. Wales coal used
by the Railway Department, these rates are
lower than the price paid by that Depart-
ment for N. S. Wales coals.” They should
not be any lower than is necessary to secure
the business. If the State mine can get the
contract from the Railways at 11s. 6d. it
ought to be getting 11s. Gd., and the extra
sixpence ought to be accumulated for the
repayment of public debt. That debt was
incurred on the strength of our great
natural resources; and as our great natural
resources are used up debt should be repaid.
The demand that the public should enjoy
the benefits of the screened-coal output of
the mine would be much better worth insist-
ing on if the same principle was applied
there, too. If, for instance, the public was
prepared to pay a price which would pro-
vide a royalty of ninepence per ton in addi-
tion to all capital and working charges, the
money to go absolutely towards the reduc-
tion of the public debt, this paper would
feel much more enthusiastic about the
matter. Without some such provision the
present generation would have all the coal
and the next generation would have all the
public debt; and it isn’t a fair deal.

The efforts to stave off a general strike at
Broken Hill and Port Pirie came to nothing.
The men don’t give a fig for Justice Hig-
gins’s opinion—they are not going to work
more than a 44-hour week. The trouble
started sizzling furiously on Saturday, when
pickets were appointed to stop men from
going in on the afternoon shift (the idea is
to work only 11 shifts a fortnight) ; and on
Tuesday a mass meeting decided to call out
all hands at mines and smelting works.
* * * *
Latest threat of strike is from Lyell. The
men reckon they didn’t get nearly enough
out of the recent Arbitration case, and there
m a lot of talk about trying some other
way. There ought to be trouble if they do.
But, unfortuuately, the Federal Arbitration
Court stultified itself when, under precisely
similar circumstances, the Broken Hill
i rop. being dissatisfied with an award, went
on strike and shut down its mine and works.
It ought to have been fined about £20,000.
I hen there would be some excuse for holding
the same sword over the Lyell men. That
permitted defiance of the law on the part
°l the Broken Hill Prop, was one of the
worst things that ever happened in con-
nection with the Australian industrial law,
and is having the most far-reaching conse-
quences.

Jimmy Isdell, busliman, prospector, drover,
aborigines protector, and ex-M.L.A., after
whom ranges, rivers, peaks and plains have
been named on the official maps of the West,
turned up in Meekatharra the other day
from a six months’ trip outback. Isdell’s
opinion is that without horses gold hunters
cannot explore the remaining auriferous
blanks between Kimberley and the Murchi-
son, and more wells should be sunk. During
his travels Isdell says he saw a lot of good
mineral country, some between Peak Hill and
Gascoyne being particularly rich in copper.
But it costs nearly £2O per ton for transport
and treatment, so the deposits are not being
rushed.

Kalgoorlie and Boulder miners have
pointed out to the Minister for Defence the
effect of the employment of aliens on recruit-
ing. Instances are given where men eligible to
fight have refused to enlist until assured that
their vacant job won’t be filled by an alien
enemy, as it is asserted many vacancies
have been. The matter was brought under
the notice of the Department some time ago,
and it is hoped somebody will very soon do
some plain speaking to the owners.

The Golden Point (W.A.) had better ex-
plain itself. At the half-yearly meeting held
in Adelaide at the beginning of December it
was announced that “operations were now
confined to Lenerberg’s new find.” But
Lenerberg has caused a notice to be inserted
in the local papers that the “new find” re-
ferred to at the Golden Point meeting does
not form part of his claim.

Both loquacious Govett and “Hail Col-
umbia” Hoover were unable to be present
at the Lake View and Oroya meeting in
London, and it fell to Cordner James to take
the chair. He hadn’t much to say, how-
ever, as Govett had sent along a speech
which took a hopeful view of the co.’s
future. This seemed to satisfy shareholders.
At any rate nobody asked for more. Accord-
ing to Govett’s statement and Cordner
James’s few remarks the maintenance of 10
p.c. divs. is assured. Referring to the co.’s
Westralian interests James emphasised the
importance of the 2100 ft. level developments
in the Lake View and claimed that values
recently exposed at the 5 and 6 levels of the
Yuanmi, in which a half interest is held,
greatly improved the outlook. As regards
the Queen, of the Hills he was not so opti-
mistic. The exhaustion of the oxidised re-
serves and the conversion of the plant for
the treatment of sulphides had been more
difficult and had occupied more time than
was expected, and he vaguely added that
profits must not be looked for until the
alterations had been satisfactorily com-
pleted. The Burma prehistoric silver-lead
venture, in which the co. holds a big inter-
est, held its meeting about the same time,
and the chairman gave some astonishing
figures as to its magnitude. He said the
show bade fair to become one of the largest
single lead-zinc-silver producers in the uni-
verse. It was capable of turning out 75,000
tons of lead, 65,000 tons of zinc, and
7,000,0000 z. of silver annually. Thus far
£2,000,000 had been spent in equipment and
development, £1,000,000 of which had been
derived from the smelters. A further large
expenditure was necessary in order to orga-
nise the undertaking on a scale which its
mineral value warranted. The production
mentioned would necessitate an annual pay-
ment of £1,500,000 in salaries and _ wages,
and would represent an increase in the
national wealth of approximately £3,500,000
per annum. Ultimately there would be a
population of 100,000 in an area which be-
fore the advent of the co. floated by Govett,
Hoover and others, was but a jungle. Pro-
posals, he said, had been made to the British
Government for the establishment of works
to deal with zinc products. He was doubt-
ful, however, about the Imperial Govern-
ment offering any encouragement, but he
was sure Hughes, the Commonwealth
Premier, would.

Red Iliil, Gulgong (N.S.W.), recently
floated in Sydney, has reversed the usual
procedure. Instead of the promoters putting
through a test crushing in the hope of
getting a result to attract speculators, they
contented themselves with generalisations.
As a consequence the flotation was . not a
complete success. The co. wisely decided to
make a bulk test before _ considering the
question of erecting machinery. An old
battery on the field was requisitioned and
30 tons from the open cut put through. The
return was a surprise, and now the pro-
moters must kick themselves for not having
made a preliminary test. The yield was
4dwt. per ton by amalgamation, 1\ tons of
pyrites, assaying 7oz. 15dwt., and tailings
•->dwt. logr. per ton. The combined figures
show an average original value of 15Jdwt.
But this was not all. A quantity of mineral
had collected in the box; this was ground
to pass through a 40-mesh sieve to extract
any coarse specks of gold. The sievings
assayed nearly 80oz. gold per ton. The
presence of this rich mineral seems to have
escaped the notice of former workers. It is
now stated that “gold is showing freely over
a face of 90 feet.”
* * * *
Lionsville, near the Clarence (N.S.W.), has
within the last few weeks bucked up a bit.
Howlie and Henderson have just finished
crushing a couple of tons from a new show,
which gave 20oz. 12dwt. smelted gold. The
show is only about 200 ft. from Bancroft’s
new find, which gave him a good Christmas
box of 40oz. from 1501 b. of stone. The old
Champion is still yielding payable stuff,
and altogether things look better on the little
field than for years past.

“Harry” Burridge retired from the Bee-
hive, Bendigo, the other day after being
there over 45 years. As a genuine specula-
tor the district never had a better. The
“Beehive”-—the Stock Exchange of Bendigo
was in its time a veritable gold mine, but
as fast as the tills were filled they were
emptied into holes in the ground. If Bur-
ridge did not prosper according to his deserts
he has the _ satisfaction of Knowing that he
earned public appreciation as one of those who
through good report and ill report pinned'
their faith to the field and by their sacrifices
helped to tide it over terms of serious adver-
sity. Burridge was at the Beehive in the
early ’7o’s, when the mad boom took place,
and the scalawags from all the earth
assembled in such numbers that not the
capacious Exchange vestibule, not the foot-
path, not the wide Pall Mall roadway could
accommodate them, but perforce the City
Council had to consent to a huge overflow
building being erected on Rosalind Park
opposite.

King Island Scheelite Co. (Tas.) is to
carry 100,000 shares of 10s. each, half of
which go to the vendors paid up to 6s. The
public is expected to subscribe 6s. (£15,000)
on the other 50,000, on the strength of
assays, that, are said to average 2.34 p.c. of
tungstic acid. J. B. Lewis reckons 60 p.c.
of this, value is recoverable, and that mining
and milling can be done for 18s. 4d., pro-
viding the mine produces and the mill treats
300 tons per week. That is where trouble
is most likely to look in; for scheelite or
tungstate of lime is just as patchy as wol-
fram, wherefore, although the concentrate is
worth over £l5O per ton just now, the
world’s output makes a Door response.

Leisner’s Wolfram Block (N.Q.) is stuping
at 460 ft., the deepest working on molybdenite-
wolfram-bismuth in the State, and perhaps
in the world. Molybdenite concentrates are
realising over £4OO and wolfram over £l5O,
the price varying according to assay. But
the always-patchy nature of the lodes pre-
vents the wolfram cos. making their fortune.
The latest mill return was 96£ tons crudes
crushed for 21cwt. molybdenite, six tons of
wolfram-bismuth concentrates, and 1471 b. of
metallic bismuth.

“Peter Oleum” ; This is the sort of piffle
those people have to put up with who be-
lieve Australia is a great oil territory. It
is contained in the annual report on North
Australia by His Heckledency Gilruth,
in the section relating to mining. T. G.
Oliver, Director of Mines, is the culprit
who embodies the gem of wisdom in an
official report and thereby secures for it a
wide circulation as well as an official one.
No further prospecting for oil has taken place in
the Northern Territory during the past 18 months.
The numerous licenses taken up during the previous
year have all lapsed through non-fulfilment of condi-
tions. I note this with satisfaction, inasmuch as
there is no geological or authentic evidence up to
the present time of oil existing in the Northern
Territory, and consequently the promotion of com-
panies in Melbourne to exploit imaginary oil deposits
cannot be of any use to the Territory-—in fact, it
will do it great harm. I might state that there
is no reason why oil should not at some future time
be discovered in parts of the Territory, either
through the explorations of a geological party or a
party of prospectors, or by means of the sub-artesian
bores for water.
Here is a Government official chortling be-
cause “no further prospecting for oil has
taken place in the Northern Territory”!
It is nearly incredible that any sane person,
let alone a highly-paid and highly-placed
public servant, should feel gratified because
nobody has attempted to prospect for oil,
the most valuable of all earth’s substances!
And he goes on to state positively the
reason for his satisfaction is that “there is
no geological or authentic evidence of oil
existing in the Northern Territory”! Evi-
dently T. G. Oliver, Director of Mines, has
not read the “Geological Bulletin of the
N.T.,” which from cover to cover indicates
that the rocks of the Territory are correct
for holding petroleum. Why doesn’t the
man dwell on these encouraging features
instead of noting “with satisfaction” the
collapse of the two poor little syndicates
that did nothing, and declaring that “there
is no geological or authentic evidence of oil
existing” in the Territory? Don’t these
officials want to be bothered with prospec-
tors? And do they think their job is to
retard the development of the Territory
instead of promoting it?
* * * *
The most striking feature of the metal
market is that Europe is paying from £lB
to £2O per ton more for electrolytic than
for ordinary copper. No wonder Hampden
easily fell in with the suggestion of Prime
Minister Hughes to have its copper refined
at Port Kembla! Who wouldn’t be “patri-
otic” at that price? At the Mount Cuth-
bert meeting the chairman stated that Cuth-
bert’s copper would be refined at Wallaroo
and Moonta works (S.A.). Wallaroo coo-
per, although high grade, isn’t electrolytic;
for, after all, what is required is suitable
copper for the manufacture of munitions.

mines throughout Australia are equipped with
“Chromol” belting. “Chromol” has replaced many
of the composition beltings which were formerly
used. It is made from special mineral-tanned leather,
and has great heat- and damp-resisting qualities,
which are essential for mining work. You can buy
it direct from the sole manufacturers, J. C. Ludowici

My Dear Arini, —
Surprising how many ways there are of
getting to England! Few people realised
it till the Mediterranean became so un-
healthy that you must even pay £5 to get
£lOO worth of dunnage insured through.
Inside the next three weeks, for instance,
there are three routes offering: one yia
Maoriland and Cape Horn, by the big Shaw
Savill ships that look in at Buenos Ayres
and Monte Video; the second by the Van-
couver route, the third via ’Frisco. And
there’s really very little difference in cost.
The P. and 0., which is alone able to
maintain its regular Suez sailings, is be-
having in the higlily-respectable manner you
might expect. “First,” said old chairman
Sutherland once, “be a gentleman. After
that, if you can, make money.” So, after
the Persia’s passengers had been murdered
by the pirates of Potsdam, the office told
agitated people who had booked their
families: “Of course, we think you’ll get
through. But there is danger—more now
than ever before. We are not going to put
any pressure on you to go. If you feel that
you are not justified in taking the risk, we
shall refund you your money without any de-
duction.” Things like that make you glad at a
time when pretty well everybody with a sign
up over his door seems anxious only to find
new ways of turning national misfortune
into private profit.
Governor Strickland’s new Aide, Captain
Firth, got a bullet through his lung in the
unmannerly battlefield. To make matters
worse, it took a zig-zag track. But Aus-
tralian sunshine is expected to cure even that.
Tennis and other jumpy forms of exercise
are forbidden, so our Best People have no
hope of seeing the young man do any circus
tricks.
Colonel Miller has been made Command-
ment of the Ma State’s military camps. It
is a stiff job, especially as regards Liverpool.
Though the well-meaning G.-G., who is a
most motherly person in military matters,
has been misguided enough to give the com-
mand there another testimonial, local condi-
tions still clamor for change. Colonel Miller,
who will move his household gods away from
dusty Canberra, is a lean, soldierly-looking
man, bristling with energy. He took a tribe
of Australian Bushmen to the S’African
squabble.
Major Nicolay, of the Goorkhas, recently
killed in action, leaves a widow who used
to be Miss May Braddon. She is a daughter
of Edward Braddon. of the Blot we used to
read about when the Federal Constitution
was bein? cobbled, and therefore a sister of
our own H.Y.
Melba has arranged to bring out, through
Hodder and Stoughton, a special edition of
her Gift Book for sale in England. Funds
go direct into King Albert of Belgium’s beg-
ging-bowl. The first cheque for £6OO on
Australian sales has already been handed
over to the soldier-king.
Leonard Dodds’s son Ted, who took his
motoring and engineering knowledge to Eng-
land because he couldn’t get the local De-
fence people to make any use of it, did a
typically Australian thing when he reached
the other side. Of course he was provided
with letters and stacks of money to see him
through to a commission. Instead of using
them he went straight to the camp of the
Motor Machine Gun Section at Bisley, and
that day he was a full-blown recruity.
Young Dodds gives an interesting account
of how they do things at Bisley. The motto
is “Hard training, and all the personal free-
dom that doesn’t interfere with it.” “We
can walk anywhere without leave, but must
be back by nine-thirty. Last Saturday six
of us walked to Woking, five miles away.”
But the freedom stops short at the entrance
to a railway station. Every church in the
district seems to have a hall, and every
hall is now part gymnasium, part writing-
room, part musical tea-room where charges
have been got down to rock-bottom by cut-
ting out all labor costs. The man who wants
beer gets it in the camp; there is a wet
canteen, of course. The English authorities
are not so wowser-ridden as to drive men
who want one beer out of the camp into
pubs whose interest it is to serve them with
twenty. That brilliant piece of tactics is
reserved for our own Mr. Pearce.
The wife and daughter of Tom Henley,
M.L.A. (he who tells us “Kind ’earts are
more than crownets”), were farewelled at
Farmer’s the other afternoon. Apparently
they are going to face the regulations that
sensibly announce, “No more petticoats to
land in Egypt.” But possibly they may
share the fate of other trippers, and have
their noses turned towards home when they
get to Colombo. Henley pere is helping to
unpack Red Cross socks in the sandy king-
dom.
Rear-Admiral Barlow, who married Bessie
Dight, of a N. S. Wales pastoral family, is
the man who now overlooks the munition
works at Leeds.
Young Geoff ery Hughes, son of Tom,
M.L.C., went to Melbourne to learn the
tricks of the bird-man's business in war-time;
but something slipped in the arrangements,
so he has now gone on to England.
At Kensington, London, Lieut. Grahame
F. Michie, only son of banker Alex. Michie,
of Dunedin (M.L.), gave a new name to
Mary McLean, of Wellington. It is not so
long since the bridegroom’s only sister
married a Maorilander named Woolcombe,
an officer of the Eastern Extension Cable
Co., and a still lesser time since, on their
return from an English honeymoon, the pair
were shot in the native upheaval which the
Huns instigated at Singapore in the early
days of the war —a tragic finish to a love-at-
first-look marriage which came as a big
shock to their M.L. relatives who are numer-
ous on both sides.
A slender Anglo-Indian, Mrs. Evershed,
was here about two years ago, with her
astronomer hubby. After inspecting our
roof, she has produced a record of her im-
pressions, “Stars of the Southern Skies,”
with special references to those floating in
the Milky Way. The recent visitor is a
sister of Mrs. R. H. Todd, the always-
knitting traveller to Double Bay.
Egerton Mills, a Queenslander in the
Rhodesian Rifles, has had several close calls

by night in East Africa. He had to lead a
charge on the enemy’s stockade a while ago.
His senior officer, Lieut. Irvine, falling mor-
tally wounded in the rush, called to the Aus-
tralian to take his place. The latter had the
luck to get through safely, and the trouble
was over in half an hour. Mills, who men-
tions the lions’ uncomfortable habit of
snapping at pickets, is a brother of Mrs.
Forrest, the industrious Queensland verse-
maker.
The haven for wounded soldiers at Rand-
wick is gradually getting shipshape. At
the main gate a sentry emerges from his pill-
box to inquire your business. Without un-
due rigor the velvet paw of discipline is
moulding the big hospital into a comfortable
depot of anaesthetics and mended limbs and
trunks. Inside the wards peace and flies
brood o’er the patients on a summer after-
noon. The flies are a murderous, persistent
crew, possibly wafted on the wings of curi-
osity from the racing stables near by. The
Women’s National Council wants to know
what occupation its own sex can follow be-
sides merely earning its crust. The Rand-
wick insect suggests an opening.
A learned pair agreed to pool their classics
in St. Philip’s Church the other day. The
bride, Phyllis Withers. 8.A., whose male
parent was the late Aubrey Withers, was
given away by her mother. The heroine’s
silky white gown was weighted with an im-
pressive court tail lined with flush pink.
Her dark hair, smoothed down in the mode
of the last moment, wore the traditional
wreath of orange blossoms. An extra halo
of learning, in the form of a gossamer-
embroidered veil, was lent by Mrs. Stafford,
a recent bride who used to be Dr. Gladys
Stephen. She was a fellow-student of
Phyllis. 8.A.. at Sydney Uni. The only
bridesmaid, Eleanor White, was frocked in
white lace, tipped with pale pink. The
directoire staff, which supports the modern
bridesmaiden on these august occasions, had
a growth of pink roses. The groom, by the
way. was Duncan Maclardy. an M.A.. who
teaches classics at Grafton Grammar School.
Second-best man Lieutenant Tomkin was
in khaki.
Manly’s Venetian and Macadamised
Road Carnival this year gives its pro-
fits to the local hospital, which no doubt
needs the help. Still the public will open its
purse strings more freely if the 1916 show
is better managed than its predecessors.
There has always been a shortage of chairs
for hire, and much money has been lost
that way. The boarders at fashionable
hotels are negligible. They get the show on
the_ cheap from their balconies. But the
plain citizen who struggles through the
crowd with Mrs. Citizen, a hand basket, a
hamper or two and eight or nine olive
branches deserves an anchorage. Last year
hundreds of such adventurous taxpayers
hunted for chairs—even at sixpence a seat —
in vain; and money that could have been
scooped in melted away on tepid lemonade,
to the great joy of the brigands who shame-
lessly announced “Iced drinks.”
A new Domain buffet for soldiers is
announced with a flourish. Ladies, who are
voluntary workers, “will remain behind the
counter,” so the prospectus says. The pub-
lic will be relieved with this assurance that
the ladies will not stand on the counter,
neither wilh they have jumping contests over
it. “No women of any class”—l quote the
rules—“except the registered workers, wear-
ing badges, will be allowed to enter.” Pre-
sumably the kiosk. “Gentlemen will act as
gatekeepers.” The buffet, thus you see. has
no use for mere men. And so on through a
maze of regulations till one falls over the
name—“Anzac Buffet.”
For months a band of voluntary workers
led by Miss Evans, have called ‘their free
buffet for returned soldiers “The Anzac.”
They have established themselves in a cool
cave adjoining the official Amelioration
Committee’s rooms. Convalescent Kan-
garoos while waiting about the premises
have this lounge and refreshment room at
their service. Now a rival show, for sol-
diers in general, calmly annexes the “Anzac ”
There'll be switches, grey and gold, on the
green before the name passes over to the
pirates.
Kathleen Ussher sends a lino from I.ou-
don that she is doing things for our JNavy
at the Commonwealth’s liub there. Jne
Usshers left home a trio, mother and two
daughters; but Loma, the violimste, a*ter a
couple of years in Saxony and thereabouts,
married a fellow musician "of foreign birth
who holds a professorship in Los Angeles,
U.S.A. Kathleen put in her time acquiring
applied and commercial arts in Dresden
and U.S.A., but the last mail finds her with
an address in Carlyle’s old location, Gheyne
Walk, Chelsea. Another Australian at the
same address was Stella Miles Franklin, who
was putting in a holiday from suffrage work
in Chicago, where she likewise edits Life
and Labor.
Bessie Garment, the only girl in ex-
A.M.P. Actuary David Garment’s family,
put her trunks aboard the Arabia last week,
labelled for Glasgow, where only-brother
David lives a busy life designing submar-
ines and such-like water-craft. David _ the
younger takes a wife shortly, and sister
Bessie, who is making a second trip to
Europe, hopes to be in time to shower
confetti on the bride.
George Fuller, who got into the State
Parliament after being driven from his
Federal nest by a rude Labor cuckoo, gives
away a pretty daughter, Gladys, this month.
The groom-to-be is a Northern pastoralist,
Stanley Coward, and the kirk in Phillip-
street is to house the ceremony.
On Christmas Eve Violet, daughter of the
late James Fowler, of Brisbane, put herself
under the orders of Lieutenant Percy Day,
of this hamlet. The wedding took place
in St. Stephen's, where big John Ferguson
usually sends his sonorous tones over bridal
veils. Mrs. Conaght gave the small wedding
party a spread at Petty’s.
Dr. Radford, formerly chief of St. Paul’s
College (he who put on lawn sleeves to
preach in Goulburn’s Anglican Cathedral),
has passed on his thirst for knowledge to a
daughter. She is amongst the recent “good
passes” in the Arts course at Sydney
’Varsity.
The Tom Hugheses and the George Earps
and many another household have retired to
Bowral for the summer. Australians are
spending more money on holidays in their
own country since the war. Manly is in the
same prosperous way. At the surf village,
you can, if you are lucky, hire a small
apartment for two guineas a week. As you
are not supposed to eat the furniture, you
forage for your daily bread. From Bowral
visitors drive towards the Berrima pleasure
grounds, where some of our well-fed enemy
subjects are interned. That is to say, they
are interned at night. In the day-time they
roam within a two-miles radius, or swim in
the river. If a photo of this attractive site
could be published in Berlin, every other
German peasant would yearn for military
confinement in Australia.
Dr. Emma Buckley, a Sydney woman
who went on to London a year ago and was
put on the staff of the Lister Institute, where
the domestic habits of bacteria are examined
under microscopes, sends a line: —
Our work here keeps us very busy, and our pre-
war ideas of things in medical and surgical fields
necessarily broaden. Still, I am not so pressed for
time as to be unable to get away week-ends and see
something of England. Oxford impresses me most.
So far as I can judge, the Australian wounded
are well looked after here. Our own women in
London are devoting themselves to this task. But,
poor fellows, they find the weather trying. It is
now 3 p.m. and dark with a thick mist.' I call it a
fog, but they tell me it is nothing.
After Easter the Girls’ Realm Exhibition
will fill the Town Hall with buzz of spinning
wheels, hum of machines and click of knit-
ting needles. “Women’s Work in War-time”
is the headline the exhibitors have to live up
to. As there is na one to rob woman of her
immemorial right to chase spiders and
clean the front doorstep, she will also show
her prowess as a domestic animal.
at Her Majesty’s, gives
the chic local article a chance, which she
takes, to show neat ankles and graceful
limbs. "Letty’ has also an imported heavy-
weight, Connie Ediss, who heaves into sight
behind a pudding basin, and occasionally
sings in a fierce Cockney accent. She’s a
convincing argument that old Gaietv favor-
ites are the stout of stage menus. Our girls
are the champagne. 6
Dorothy Brunton is the bright, particular
star. She first rotates in a sliell-pink frock
in which she very properly refuses to clean
saucepans. As the fascinating voung house-
keeper who won’t housekeep she feeds her
protesting husband on sardines and kisses
Lonnie, who lives next door, does so much of
her housekeeping on the front lawn, owing
to the exigencies of stage-management that
even epicures in the front stall remain cold
to her reputation as a cook. Frocks as worn bv
the chorus charmers, buds apparently in the
first blush of grease-paint, are distracting
\isions in these days of plain and simple
fashions. For instance, filmy hats like slices
of pink sunset are worn with lampshade
tunics over glittering Oriental skirts giuzv
as a butterfly’s wing. Black muffs and black
velvet halters are the antidote to so much
JSV?* however, the slim Sydney
girl fails. She makes a poor Highlander

below her knees, as in “Letty.” she shows

Yvonne Charvin is rounding up the per-
formers for a concert of French music in
February. It’s a limp month to dangle a
musical bait before a perspiring public. But
Consul Chayet—who is gcdpa of the event-
lias decided it so. Verbrugghen will lend his
aid and the Conservatorium will house the
harmony.
Dr. Dunlop and his wife, of Wollstone-
craft, are still in England. They left Sydney
for a few months’ trip on the trail of two
sons who were wounded in Gallipoli and
forwarded to England for repairs.
Fair and fluffy Dolly Castles went off to
U.S.A. in the Sierra. She’s booked to sing
to Woodrow Wilson. I hope it does him good.
Though Carrie Moore has put on weight
since the days when she warbled, “If all the
stars were mine,” the avoirdupois is nicely
distributed, and she makes a very shapely
Principal Boy in “Dick Whittington.” In
the second act she is apparently poured into
a creaseless set of black silk tights with a
boyish jumper of the same skin-tight
material. A glittering paste buckle flickers
on one well-turned leg. She has lost none of
her old charm. As Dick, who became Lord
Mayor of London without any help from the
Government, Carrie gives a good account of
herself, and she is still a long way ahead of
99f per cent, of the expensive importations
who murmur “Gee!”
The Second Divisional Ammunition Col-
umn committee wants help in money or
kind. There is to be a meeting at the Town
Hall on January 14; but if you can’t be
there send to the depot in Falmouth Cham-
bers, Pitt-street.
The Chamber of Commerce is in charge
of a forthcoming Trades Fair in the Town
liall. Various battalion funds have secured
the right to cater in turn for a tea-thirsty
public. They bank the profits for their sol-
diers’ little luxuries.
Consider the gum-leaves, they toil not,
neither do they spin, but from them two
Mosman girls now extract a beautiful khaki
dye wherewith to stain the wool that they
(the girls, not the gum-leaves) spin. They
go down into their own wild garden and
gather the red tips of the eucalyptus (said to
be the peppermint-gum), boil the same in
kerosene-tins, and the muddy-looking liquid
resulting gives a clear, uniform brown for
socks for soldiers. The A.M.C. gave the
simple printed formula for the process, but
judging by the astonishment of a certain
professional dyer on seeing a specimen of the
amateurs’ work, and marking the haste with
which he fared forth to French’s Forest to
filch the rations of the ’possum and the
native bear, the formula could not have been
generally known.
A competent authority asserts that we
hitherto exported our eucalyptus foliage and
got it back in liquid and paste forms for
brown dyes. Probably some Fritz Gotthelf-
uns did the work. Oh, well, from now on
our ears won’t grow so long, and we won’t
be the booby prizers we used to be!
Last quarter of 1915 was very unkind to
the gardens, and to make up the deficit in
flowers some of our florists had to buy from
Tasmania. One Mdlle. Flora got 18,000
blooms from our small, cold sister isle. Not
ali of these carried well. The white gladioli
proved the stayers, lasting 11 days after
disembarking.
Skirts have been growing steadily shorter.
The effect on wearers of clothes-prop pro-
portions is not one of unalloyed charm. Stiff
early-Victorian ruches are more popular
than flounces, so the long, thin lady whose
hem is creeping up to mid-shins has nothing
to mitigate the shrinkage in dress material.
One social shiner, taking afternoon-gossip
and a little war-talk with half a dozen of
the very best, spoke in reference to the bad
conditions at Anzac prior to the visit of the
Secretary for War. “Oh, yes,” she piped
complacently, “but, as you say, that was
before Kipling went to Gallipoli.”
The women’s swimming carnival occurs
in February. There are to be two mermaid
gambols. One at Coogee and the other as a
fillip to the jaded spirits of our Naicest at
Manly, where leapfrog in the moonlit surf is
the latest society frolic. Fanny Durack will
again challenge competition for the rdle of
mermaid-in-chief, and ladyfish Wylie is also
in the net.
Skirts, like young oysters, have been
much scalloped this summer. The basement
of the linen frock, so to speak, shows the
wavy curve of white braid, hitherto associ-
ated with brown holland covers and infants'
pinafores. It's a moderate success when the
ankles are worth a glimpse.
St. Vincent's Hospital has to battle with
war-time conditions like other havens for
sick humanity. Its up-to-to-morrow nurses’
home has the usual incubus, a building debt,
to he shovelled off. So there’s to be a card
party sandwiched with music and light re-
freshments. On the premises; January 19:
A concert party, steered by John Brown-
low, to Casula. found the camp delightfully
situated on a hill. A large and appreciative
audience of soldiers, and a larger and more
appreciative orchestra of mosquitoes, occu-
pied the big tent where the visiting per-
formers made their defence. Exes, were paid
out of funds in hand. The committee has
still about £OO in the till, and wants more.
1 "o concerts at Casula in February and
several to come at Liverpool will eat up all
this in train fares.
Yours affectionately.
VANDOHIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, January 10, 1916.
My Dear Yarrie,—
Here’s another of them! Jack Butler, son
of that Henry Butler who, with other But-
lers, used to help the late Frederick Sargood
with his softgoods. While Australia is beg-
ging for recruits to relieve the dead or over-
worked heroes of Anzac, he left for the other
side by the Maloja, hoping to find a commis-
sion with some English regiment.
An account comes to hand from Bangalore
of the State entry of the Rajah of Puduk-
kotai—local spelling—and Mrs. Puduk-etc.
into their kingdom or whatever it is. She,
you remember, was Molley, daughter of bar-
rister and journalist Wolfe Fink. Appar-
ently most of the copper-colored burghers,
who number about 500,000, and a large
quantity of elephant, turned out to welcome
the pair, who were presented with some
well-chosen remarks in a silver casket. The
loyal residents of the shire expressed the
fond hope that Molley would be “a mother
to us all,” and the Rajah thanked God for hav-
ing been pleased “to vouchsafe to me at last
a partner who is, in my opinion, qualified to
fulfil my ideals.” The full title of Molley’s
fine coffee-colored boy is “His Highness
Sree Brahadamba Das Raja Sir Marthanda
Bhirava Tondaman Bahadur Rajah of
Pudukkotai,” hut they don’t print it all on
their visiting cards.
Nobody outside the family knows exactly
what they are doing in the grub-grazing line,
or where they keep them; but the fact is
the Frank Maddens have started to take a
serious interest in sericulture. With the
eye of faith I can see the Speaker casting
off his wig with an air of relief on the arri-
val of the Christmas recess, and hurrying
homewards, a string-bag of lettuce in one
hand and in the other a silk-winder made out
of a cigar-box during luncheon-adjournments ;
and I can follow him as he tiptoes eagerly
into the wormery to note how his grubs grow.
But probably my eye of faith would see
wrong, “Dinner first!” being his working
watchword. Still, it is something to know
that the Kew Maddens, so long just orna-
mental, are at length attempting to encour-
age even one local industry.
The Charlie Fairbairns, who own Banon-
gil, •on Mount Emu Creek, have had news of
their son Osborne, who belongs to the Flying
Corps. Osborne had been working in France
recently, and on his latest voyage was
winged badly enough to need a long stay in
hospital. Mamma Fairbairn was herself lately
in England, and found the Australian “the
idol and hero of the British public,” and our
boys in hospital “splendidly looked after,”
generally speaking. As Mrs. Charlie is an
Australian, anxious to see Australia “done
well,” and has had quite an extensive experi-
ence of keeping an eye on Australian soldiers
in the obscurer British hospitals where they
might easily get sidetracked, her latter re-
mark ought to comfort a whole multitude of
Australian mothers.
Captain Guy Miller has been killed in
France, after doing fine medical w T ork. Guy
is the fourth son of the grey-haired Mrs.
Albert Miller, of Whernside. He married
pretty Marjorie Levey, of the Grice clan,
who was keenly interested in amateur act-
ing. Their marriage took place some three
years ago, when young Osborne O'Hara, also
killed on the field of France, gave the 'groom
his moral support. Guy Miller was a fine
type of young Australian of much promise.
He lately partnered with Doctor Percy TYeb-
ster. and was specialising in eye and ear
work. A good athlete, he played tennis and
cricket among the first rankers, and he could
do very respectable work with a violin.
The Town Hall patriotic fort, which was
evacuated during the holidays, is once more
in its normal state of activity. All the
passage-ways are choked with bundles of
sandbags, ready to be dumped on to the
next transport that has room for them.
About 100,000 have been sent forward
already, and have helped to build trenches
and halt Turkish bullets. The women them-
selves rope the bags up into bundles when-
ever they have a spell from packing and
mailing up 701 b. cases of other goods. Graft?
The Town Hall is like a speed-up factory.
The only restful features are the lovely,
peaceful officials that stroll around the pas-
sages in buttons and blue-cloth, or lean up
against the walls gasping for breath. The
sight of so much work unnerves them.
G.-G. Ferguson and Lady Helen returned
to Melbourne last week under cover of a
thunderstorm. The sacred blue limousine
swung round the points at Collins-street cor-
ner just when a plebeian cable tram was in
the act of crossing. The traffic controller for
one awful moment was on the verge of
holding up sub-royalty, but in the nick of
time his guardian angel wirelessed him and
he frantically pushed the tram back on its
hind wheels, kowtowed three times and mur-
mured. “Pass, your Highness’s Grace,” or
words to that effect.
Mayoress Ilennessy is still at Queenscliff
trying the salt-water cure for nerves
frayed by an overdose of war work.
The Gaud Mayor’s wife takes her civic
responsibilities seriously and wears herself
out trying to do the square thing all round.
It’s a difficult job to do the square thing all
round, but some people have accomplished
it. Unfortunately most of them died very
soon afterwards.
Lauclilan Mackinnon, who was commis-
sioned a lieutenant the other day, is busy in
France. Mrs. Lauehlan, jun., who recently
arrived in London, will proceed to Scotland.
She was formerly Hilda Law, daughter of
the editor of the Edinburgh Scotsman, and
will bivouac amongst her people until the
expected or the unexpected happens to the
war. One or other is almost sure to happen.
Meanwhile Melbourne is short of one of
its smartest frockers.
From breezy Queenscliff flutters news of
the engagement of Walter Kirby to a Miss
Dutton, who, amongst other qualifications
for being a helpmate, has an income you
might term comfortably silver-lined. The
betrothal did not prevent Walter arranging
two concerts, one for the benefit of the
Red Oi’oss and one for the advantage of
himself. All the Very Naicest attended, and
amongst those who filled in spaces between
the star’s contributions were Ida Fink (the
droopy sister of the Ranee of Pudokota),
Daisy Gove, Rosa Walter and George Chant.
Queenscliff is swarming with honeymoon-
ers. St. Kilda’s Lieutenant Len. Beauchamp
and his bride have been raising a dust in a
high-powered motor. Pretty Enid Wilkin-
son, daughter of Dr. Wilkinson, of Haw-
thorn, and her new soldier-husband, Lieuten-
ant Roberts, were at the Grand. Also,
amongst the giddy throng were the Bert
Cooks —she in a dazzling emerald green
bathing-suit most of the time: he having a
final fling before harnessing himself for war
this week. Dr. Len Spiers and Marjorie
Dunn, his bride-to-be on February 1, were
making the most of the time left them before
his dash for the trouble. An exciting incident
was a troopship that anchored sufficiently
handy to shore to enable the holiday-makers
to put out to her in row-boats with cargoes
of books, sweets and smokes.
Dr. Bert Fetherston, who has been raised
to the dignity of Surgeon-General, had an
awkward time in Egypt, where he was re-
peatedly mistaken for George Rex travelling
incog. The likeness is remarkable, and the
doc. had so many embarrassing experiences
that he finally ducked into a barber's estab-
lishment and had his whiskers shorn to the
roots. Apparently George Rex’s job isn’t
all it’s cracked up to be.
My Adelaide chum cries for pity:—
We sweltered steadily for 14 days, and now, after
a brief cooling off, we are sweltering again. Seaside
and hills boarding-houses and hotels are full to
suffocation. The spirit of the bargain-hunter alone
survives, and since the holidays town has been full
of women paying more than ordinary for unwearable
“bargain garments.”
On New Year’s Day the star attractions were a
regatta at Victor Harbor and the S.A.J.C. Races at
Morphettville, with Lady Galway at the former and
the Governor at the latter. Premier Vaughan was
also to speak at Victor Harbor, but by the time his
laggard motor arrived a thunderstorm had dispersed
his audience, so he’s a speech to the good. That
storm, by the way, added to the gaiety of the races,
sending rain hot-foot after dust, so that millinery
took on elaborate ornamentations in reddish mud.
On Tuesday the Naylor-Wilson wedding occurred
at Norwood. He, as you know, is our most pictur-
esque University professor. The Stokes-Evans affair,
which was postponed owing to Dr. Evans's illness, is
to be in the early part of next week.
From Bombay comes news of singer Francis Halls,
an ex-Conservatorium student whose voice has won
favor at Bombay. Word comes also of another
Adelaide singer, Stanley Newman; he has a com-
mission in the 11th Queen’s (West Surrey) regiment.
One of the last smiles that came to the face of
old Chief Justice Way flickered there when he was
told that his nephew, Captain James Way, who
served in the Boer War and got a commission in the
artillery at the close of it, has been doing fine things
and been mentioned in despatches. His battery has
been in France since the early days of the war.
Mr. Girdlestone’s place as headmaster of St.
Peter’s College is to be “temporarily filled” by T.
A. Caterer, who has been on the college staff for
about 30 years. The “temporarily” is because the
regulations of the college insist that the headmaster
shall be an Anglican clergyman, and “T.A.C.” did
not take orders. As a matter of fact, when he
wasn’t teaching he was too busy rearing turkeys.
Incidentally, he claims to be the first graduate of the
local University, and belongs to probably the best-
known family of teachers in the State.
The Y.M.C.A. clubhouse at Henley Beach has been
opened by Lady Galway, after whom it has been
christened. It is non-residential, but provides every-
thing necessary for long days at the beach,_ and
will be a godsend to the returned wounded for
whose use it has been erected.
L. W. Stanton, secretary to the Minister of Educa-
tion, has been seriously ill, but is convalescing. He,
by the wa3 7 , is due to retire from the Service at the
end of June. Railways Commissioner A. B. Mon-
creiff, Commissioner of Police W. H. Raymond and
his secretary G. L. Reed, Under-Secretary Sholl, and
Dr. Holtze, who for the last 25 years has been re-
sponsible for the Botanical Gardens, are amongst
those marked to go at the same time. Mr. Shall
has been in the service since ’5B, and has had the
joy of serving 14 Chief Secretaries, beginning \\i
Dr. Cockburn and ending with the present A. W.
Styles. Mr. Raymond has been in the police for
years; his successive chiefs were Warburton, George
Hamilton, Peterswald and Madley.
Octogenarian King Cole, of the Book Ar-
cade, has given away his girl Ada to a man
likely to appreciate her all the more for the
bookv atmosphere of her upbringing. Angus
Turnley is the bridegroom, and the event
was pulled off by Dr. Strong the other after-
noon at the Australian Church. In days
long passed away the Turnleys used to grow
grass for sheep on the TV estern Downs; bu
Angus Turnley has been a city man these
many rears. He is of what is sometimes
known as “a literary turn of mind, and once
edited a paper.
Septimus Miller, who lately threatened to
leave Edward, M.L.C., as the last of the
“Moncv” Miller brotherhood, has pulled him-
self together, left Cantala, and gone to take
the high air at Macedon with his new family.
It is not long since Septimus became a happy
father, and he marked the event by handing
a million or so to one of the patriotic funds.
This distributing of immense sums is rather
a habit of his. For instance, when they
wanted a bigger Anglican church for south-
ern Malvern, where Charles (Dorotliy-
McCrae) Perry was in charge of a conse-
crated bandbox. Miller said "Here y are,
and paid out £5OO in one scribble.
Last night I attended “Under Fire” at
the Royal, and this morning I got up early
to read the programme. After glancing at
a paragraph about an actress whose black
opals were swallowed by a cow or some-
thing I skipped half a dozen chapters and
got to the middle of the volume. Here i
learned that the Lessees and Managers ot
the theatre were J. C. TV illiamson, Ltd., and
the Managing Directors are Messrs, George
Ward. Clyde Tallis and Hugh Meynell.
Then came a list of 40 characters and the
names of the mimes playing them. I was
delighted to come across this, for I might
otherwise have remained ignorant of the iden-
tity of the talented actor who took the part
of “John (English Army).” I presume he
is the lad who moaned twice in the hospital
scene. And of the two tragedians who sup-
ported the exacting roles of “Jim (of the
English Red Cross),” and “Fred (of the
English Red Cross),” who, I imagine, are
the heroes that walked across the stage
carrying a stretcher in the last act. On the
same informative page appear the names of
the General Manager and the Business
Manager and the Stage Manager and the
Assistant Stage Manager and the Assistant
Stage Manager (more of him) and the
Band Conductor and the Scene Painter and
the Mechanist and the Property Master and
the Electrician and the Wardrobe Mistress
and (we’ve nearly finished) the Musical
Director.
At this stage, when I had got only
about half-way through the volume, I was
interrupted, and on returning to resume my
reading I found that somebody 7 had removed
the volume to use as a weight for pressing
an ox-tongue. In consequence of her
thoughtless action I am doomed to remain
ignorant as to who it was that taught Tom
McLarnie to snort in Germhun, or who the
charwoman is that sweeps out the gallery—
in whom I, in common with the rest of the
public, take an absorbing personal interest.
Still I would like to mention that anybody
in need of a weight for pressing tongues
should visit the Royal and obtain a pro-
gramme. It can be had in different styles
at prices ranging from Is. to 6s. One is
not forced to stay and see the play.
A much-travelled citizen of Australasia
makes no disguise of the fact that he re-
cently got a curt notice to quit a seaside
hotel where he was wont to sojourn when in
Melbourne. The autocrat gave no reason
for the decree, but everybody knew how the
trouble arose. The outspoken citizen is
better informed than most people concerning
hotels and German waiters, and when he
found five of these enemy aliens on the pre-
mises he aired his opinions. His remarks,
besides reflecting on the management, were
objectionable to the five German waiters.
And of course that couldn’t be put up with.
So the mere Britisher was shown the door.
Major Stanley Argyle, of the A.A.M.C.,
left for Egypt early last year in charge of an
X-ray outfit, and there was a tremendous
demand for his services. Presently he got
that very tired feeling, and had to come back
to Melbourne on furlough. Now, almost
immediately, he is off again, and expects to
be on the spot when Turkey’s last million,
with its bag of dates and its pint of dirty
water, makes the promised dash for Cairo.
Dr. A. V. Green, who bislioped Ballarat
for many a long Sunday and ran a memor-
able theological seminary 7, and staggered the
entire cloth last year by handing in his
precious gaiters, is a kind of freelance soul-
fisherman these days. He has been appointed
Canon at St. Paul’s, Melbourne, in place of
Canon J. B. Gason, and the customary de-
tails of the ceremony were attended to by
Archbish. Clarke. Dr. Green is the good
Australian, you remember, who said that
he wasn’t going to skip off to England to
die —that Australia was a better place even
to die in than the Cold Country.
A cable from London says that Gladys,
the younger of the Brighton Weatherly
girls, was married two days before Christ-
mas to Lieutenant-Commander Harry Mac-
kenzie, R.N. The bridegroom is a cheerful
engineer who was in Australia two or three
years ago, and his choice comes from the dis-
tressingly rich squatting Weatherlys.
Artist Ambrose Patterson, who of late
found paintings harder t<y sell than ice-
bergs in winter, has left for the Neutral
States, taking his pretty wife with him.
Katie Heriot, mentioned in General
French’s honor list of nurses, is a VYilliams-
town girl and qualified at the Homoeopathic
and Women’s Hospitals. She is an athletic
miss, a swimmer of renown at her own waterv
suburb, and a native Australian who went to
France at the beginning of last year. Her
proud poppa is Andrew Ileribt, a sea-wise
old ship’s-chandler and sail-maker of \Vil-
liamstown, who once wore the mayoral
rabbit-skins provided by that municipality.
Charlie Franklin came down from the
Naval College on a visit to his headmaster-
brother at the Grammar School. Subse-
quently the pair faded away to the Albert
Austens’ country place to get fit for next
thrashing season.
Muriel, daughter of manager Cole, of the
London Bank, is the designer and author of
“Gum Leaves,” a collection of verses ad-
dressed by the Australian girl to her 200,000
brothers on service. The little book is dedi-
cated to “Our Happy Warriors,” and the
Wounded Soldiers’ Fund will benefit bv its
wide sale.
Mrs. Lowther Clarke’s Cathedral Tent
Christmas-dinnered about 400 soldiers. The
tent in the cramped Cathedral “gar-
den” does a rattling business ordinary times
when it is open until 11.30 p.m. A good
square fourpenny feed can be had from the
matronly St. Paulines at any hour; and
billiards, deck chairs, note paper and books
are always on the premises.
Little Sumner Locke scattered hasty
adieux among her friends before rushing to
Sydney the other week. Melbourne would
see her no more for an indefinite period, she
said. From Sydney she would be off to the
U.S.A. within six months. She has placed
one or two books with a Yankee firm, and
may be cabled for before the six months are
up. In any case, the mercurial little Sumner
will be up to her ears in ink until she gets
away. The difference betwen her and the
Tennysonian lady whose warrior was
brought home deceased is that the widow had
to die if she couldn’t weep, whereas the light,
literary spinster must die if she doesn’t
work.
Energy and brains seem to run in the
Locke clan. Young Jack, a Duntroon Col-
lege boy (no near relation to the penlady
aforementioned), has been scoring rapid pro-
motion in Gallipoli. Jack —he’s brother of
clever Mollie Locke, who dropped her stage
aspirations to go and get married —was a
lieutenant when he went awa y. At latest he
was staff-captain of his brigade, taking that
in preference to a proffered inajakship in the
battalion. llis brigade is laden with honors,
it seems. The Brigadier and all the batta-
lion commanders have received the “C. 8.”
distinction, and Staff-Captain Locke has been
“mentioned.”
Young Franc Carse, who became a law-
yer, a Parliamentary candidate, a husband,
a father and an officer in the A.I.F. within
very recent memory, lately found that the
Gallipoli diet didn’t agree with him and was
despatched to Britain to recover. His wife
rushed off to book her passage when she
heard the news, and the family is now
united in London. Lieutenant Carse was
front-named after that uncle Franc Fal-
kiner who represented Riverina (N.S.W.)
in the Reps, for a third of a term. The
lengthy Lieutenant’s political record con-
sists of a candidature in opposition to Joe
Hannan, Labor M.H.R. for Fawkner (Yic.)
at the last Federal election; and he has also
been a party to some earnest doings in
Liberal schools of oratory and platform
manners.
After all, the widow Butler finds Brighton
Beach a dreary spot without her lad Jack,
who left the other day for King Edward's
Horse via Suez ; so she is booking front P.
and O. seats for some time next month. Lyn.
the massive Butler girl who isn't long out of
short skirts, will go, too, and will chance
submarines to see brother in his British
uniform in the springtime.
Presbyterian dames may be poor frivollers.
but when it comes to the useful task of
knitting, their performances are the envy of
the sex. They take to wool as they do to
heather or porridge, and the socks just ripple
off their fingers. The Patriotic League gets
SOO pairs every month from the various
Scotchbyterian kirks.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

up. inside the I-annings' front gate. There
he made one final, audible remark, and de-

"Oh well." said Jimmy again. “I came
over t* berry the loan o' some three-inch nails
til l day after to-morra. Buildin' a bit of a
shed."
"Dad's down in the stable." said Lotta.
briefly, and turned into the living-room.
He stood there in the dark for a moment,
somewhat dashed, staring imo the lighted
room, and then plunged off the verandah
again.
It was some days before those three met
nee more. According to Jimmy's line of
reasoning, nee a girl had been : rn out of
the unwelcome embrace of a presuming lover
she would naturally be done with the f iled
one for a 1. But Jimmy was a person oi
no wide experience of woman's little ways-
Lotta one morning went an >r : the ••ne-

He pulled up*.
"Like t* hop up':" he asked. respectfully.
It was warm weather, and the two mil s
ahead looked a It: way to Lotta. She
hopped up.

A fortnirht later there was a dan-re at the
Dinni-t n? HalL a lon-r structure set in the
midst of wide pastures for the convenience
and pleasure of the local farmers and their
help.
Lottt. went. So did Jimmy Browner.
As the concertina s* unded a few prelimi-
nary squeaks and to* ties. Jimmy made for
Lotta. . ,
"This for me?" he asked, grinning rondly
upon her. Lotta smiled and nodded, and
made room for him on the bench at her ride.
"Haven’t been over to see us this week,
she said kindly.
"Xuh." Jimmy answered, without explana-
tions. ”C**min : over on Sunday, though.
Ain't I?"' . ,
Lotta locked at him without dissimula-
° "Y —hes." she said —rw sweet syllables of
the utm st warmth- Jimmy glowed al;
through.
“Til come over t' tea." he murmured, and
the concertina start-M with a 1 ud blast or
melcdy that br* ught everybody into -Hidden
moxement.
The evening w re on. Jimmy danced with
Lotta —danced frequently. One or two older,
married men -.is; “had the privi.-ae. 1 ’ne
or two wallflowers and elderly c**nsins danced
with Jimmy. But there came a time when
L rta found fcer*-lf sitting ut alone. whik
Jimmy danced with a sec* -nd-cousin who.
th -ugh old en ugh to know better, yet relied
her eyes up at him as they r I died thr imii
the measure. At that -rig- f the tr.c--.d-
ings Lyhane happened ak ng.
He approached Lotta.
“Not dahccin' r he asked, with more re-
spectfulness than ever.
“Oh. yes." said Lotta. quire brightly. "No
wail-lowerin' for me. " she tied herself with
a gentle wave of indignati n partially sub-
merging her tetter judgment.
“Pshnee this -ne ?“ suggested Lyhane. with
me extreme politeness of a .at purring for
milk.
Lotta arise, and danced.
Afterwards. I.y bane and Jirr.mv met in the
sta right.
“I don't give two howls in Heil trkmi y*
think about ■oritv'.’” Lyhane snaried to
Jimmy's alamamm: and off they went at it
again, while by rw-s and threes the darners,
come ont to take a taste from a bottle ender
a besh. surrounded them and helped with
frequent adju ratio ns.
Browner had the best of it by the time
the more married men arrived and cast a
blight on the entertainment. But he ha L a
purple eye.id. and ne rode off home with-.sit
waiting t: see Letts acam.
Niw that week there ame a plague .if
grasshoppers through the Moemooaing wheat-
c -unity. Where the "toppers swept across
they left nothing but the* bare stalks stand-
ing. Grata and nag were clean gone: and
after he pest, along the stricken swathe,
there roQ wed a noise of cursing and hunen*
- bfme o; the Mcemo" mna inneis
were men who half-share! ticks on the
fringe or Yorindth and Xamkeet senat-
tag-s. Lyhane was cue of these: and. in
their pragma imw the IbaMoun de-
triet itart of the Yorindab-Xarrakeet wheat-
helped to sustain the grasshoppers dur-
inz their pilgrimage.
On the promised Sunday morning Jimmy
Browner arose and looked closely at himself
in his shaving-mirror.
•i n do no good with this bloke in the dis-
trK-k," he declared somewhat plaintively,
observing his still slightly-empurpled eyelid
with wrath and sorrow.
Yet. remarkably for James, he had enough
self-confidence to take the trip that evening
to Ironing’- farm, having pot on his extra-
trousers-free suit and anointed bis hair with
the oil of gladness. Bat he waited until
after tea, when the sun had set and a
gorgeous moon was risen.
fx>tta was in the living-room, ar.d old
Banning, as usual- dow-n at the stables, while
Lotta’* mother bad an important engage-
ment in the dairy.
Salutations: and then Lotta went to the
open verandah-door and looked out.
•It s moonlight." she said, and took a step
outside.
“Boshter night.'’ agreed James, and fol-
lowed.
Lotta sat in the big cane chair. James
leaned again-t one of the verandah-posts, for
there was no other chair available. During
a quarter of an hour they spoke fully a
dozen words. In a fumbling sort of way
Jimmy’s mind was turning ever that matter
of the shortage in c-hairs. Am- ng the stocks
in the paddocks to the west a .a ; nt breeze
made a zende murmuring, and a little owl
tooted in the wind-break of gums.
At length Lotta burst the ice open.
~Se*-n Tom I.yhane lately?" she asked.
Jam-- held the post tightly and stared
ending upon the lovely scene.
"Nub,” he replied.
"Heard he had bad luck with the grass-
b- pi pers.’* Lotta told him. "Heard they ate
hie right ont. an’ he cleared out to Mel-
bourne without a ha'penny in his poc-ket.”
James still stared into the night.
"Hard hick." he muttered, after a pause,
ia a crumbling tone.
Another pause-
“ Oh. I dunno.” said Lotta. She left her
chair and c-ame across to stand beside James.
"What d'y’ see out there?”
"Nothin'.” replied James. truthfully
en ugh. and turned to I -k at the pleasantly-
perfumed. pinky-white, curvy. brignt-eyed.
now unsmiling girl beside him—very close
beside him. He looked —and, partly because
Lyhane had g* ne. partly because, when he
locked, he forgot Lyhanc. he did not stop at
looking.
"01l Jimmy, don't Lotta pleaded. But
Jimmy kept on doing it.
That was on Sunday. On M.-nday. at
midday. Jimmy met T**m Lyhane on the
Sandhills road. Lyhane was in his working
clothes- Jimmy polled up his h- rse and
stared : but Lyhane very prudently to-k no
n> rice, passing on with his hand- in his
p - ketS- Jimmy pushed a. Eg t. the corner
of Yorindah, wh-re the Lyhane wheat had
been eaten ont by grass? ppers. But the
Lyhane wheat, perfectly immune, was par-
tially harvested, and a machine stood :n the
crop, while a couple of men took their c-rib
in the shads -f some v* ting gums by the r ad.
Jimmy stared at them, stare*! at the stocks
and the standing crop, stared at the men
again, and then turned an*! poshed his nag
hack the way he had come. The men stared
after him.
That evening James creakily occupied the
s iitary eane-c-kair on the verandah.

THE ROOSTER: "Now, get to your deguats?
“Maskee": Does any Abo.-liar know of
any arts in Australia to come up to the driver ants
of 'Vest Africa? An interesting description of their
methods is given by an Australian who is bossing
riggers on a mine out from Obuasi. on the Gold
Coast. “I had a visit from the driver ants the other
night,'' he says. “Fortunately I was in bed under
the mosquito nets, so they couldn't get at me. but I
could bear the lizards and rats leaving in a hurry.
. These anrs are cot poisonous, but they bite like the
Devil's bloodhound, and once they catch anything it
can't get away. I saw a mob with a small snake.
The snake was lashing out, but they were too many
for him. and he had disappeared after an hour or
two. They spread when looking for food, but line
up about a dozen abreast when on the march. The
mob that visited me lined up in the morning and
went off. I estimated about a hundred a second
passed a given spot. They travel very fast and are
only small, but that line was passing my door for
ever eight hours. I have seen a mob goirg for three
ua. s. and I have heard of se-me moire taking over a
week to pass the one spot. There must be tens of
millions in a mob. and you see these lines all over
the bush. It is said that if it were not for the
driver it would be impossre-Ie to live in the country ;
they are great scavengers.”

if any Australian has grown a croo of wheat thre
year farther out than Gongotgoa- Yes. I am skulf-
drivieg. back o’ sunset, at Shattleton, 50 miles out
from Cobar. I have in the school at the present
moment half a dozen samples of wheat and oats
grown here by different men for hay, which cut np
to two tons *to the acre, and averaged over a ton.
The tallest wheat was 6ft. Sin., and the altitude of
the oats was as much as 7ft. Ain. The rainfall here
is 10 to 11 inches per annum—sometimes. By the
"•ay, "Enby is a small fellow as reganis travel
when he t-uss of “Gc-iforsaken Gongoigon.” He's cot
been past the edge.

“Lagani-Xamo”: As we were reaching
■cross amongst the reefs for the parage into 1 ule
Island (Papua) the wind dropped and left us
becalmed. It was about three o'clock in the after-
noon, and all hands were anxious to make the
island, because the ominous sky and the dense ban-,
of black encircling the horizon to windward pre-
saged something extra in the way of yuba.t (storms;.
So the native crew of the Kikeni got out the loi.g
sweeps and toiled to pull the ketch to and through
the passage. Suddenly the sea, which had been as
unruffled as glass, seethed and boiled for acres about
us, and the water was absolutely brown with fish.
With frantic excitement the niggers hauled their
sweeps irboard and
sccoped the minrows
aboard with buckets,
boards or whatever was
hardy. Great kir.gn.-h
and “pike" gleamed
and flashed like silver
as they tore fiercely
through the turmoil of
ana Her fish. Below
ind encircling the shoal
was an army of king-
fish, preventing the
escape of their prey.
Presently the commo-
tion subsided as the
sardines gained a tem-
porary respite owing to
the kingfish scouts hav-
ing announced the arri-
val of a school of
sharks. The water
seethed again as these
monsters with snapping
jaws swished and tore
through the banquet-
Whilst the sharks were
gc-rgirg the kirgi-h
leapt frantically around
the fringe of the feast,
and massed tor another
attack despite the
sharks. Like so mary
torpedoes they raged in
at one side and out at
Hie other. There they
concentrated again and
drove back through the
excitement. By this
time gulls and sea-
hawks of all kinds were
circling overhead, ard
flying to the scene from
every direction. Soon
they, too, were busy,
their bill- sna; ; icg
lise castanets *s thev
snavrf-ed and SuUeie

Manager invited us to hear the new musical instrument the Pianola
Company have recently put on the Australian market—the Aeolian-
Vocalion. Mr. Brown—the Vocalion Manager put several disc records on
the instrument; the tone is wonderful ! during a flute solo called “The
Wind in the Trees,” it was so realistic, that I got quite excited and
caught father by the shoulder. Dad bought one of the £35 models, and a

there is a treat in store for you all.

best tree-food in X. S. Wales- Twenty bullocks
recertly sold in Melbourne averaged a trifle over £4O
per head, the best bringing £45. This lot had just
emerged from a solid two-year drought at Spring-
dale (X.S.W.), during whic-h they had lived on
inulga. Take another case. Smith laced the drought
with 900 sheep, and at the conclusion had practically
a tull muster. The mutton had grazed for over two
years almost exclusively on mulga. Slightly different
from the ordinary drought victory was the case of
Jot es. who kept a stallion for six months on mulga
alone —three feeds a day—and at the end of the
period his horse was in fair condition.

the result of inbreeding. Their bodies are small,

which make them look like caricatures. They live in
this salt swamp amongst the tienae scrub, through
which it is almost impossible to travel. If you race

Do you realise that money is going to win the War? That every penny of yours
that goes out of this Country—for foreign-made tyres—is going to help tilt
the balance one way or other in the fight for British Supremacy, not only
on sea and land, but in the Financial World. The Chancellor of the
British Exchequer has issued a solemn appeal to Britishers against letting
their gold go out of the Empire, and thus weakening its resources.
WHERE DOES YOUR TYRE MONEY GO? IT’S. WORTH'
CONSIDERING. Every motorist who purchases Australian made
DUNLOP TYRES
can be certain of not only obtaining the Most Durable' Tyres made, but N v
the Best Wearing on Australasian roads. There is nothing “ Neutral ” X 4
about their origin—they represent Australian Capital, Australian Work-
manship, and "they have no superior. Such being the case, there is
not one sound reason why any motorist should purchase imported tyres.
Are vou u*ing “ DUNLOPS," and thus strengthening- the Empire’s resources? They are

WORN-OUT LOOK OF THE
KIDNEY MARTYR
Hoiv is the face of a typical kidney sufferer—puffin ess and lines under the eves, showing
that the kidneys are weak or disordered—a tendency to dropsy. Look of agony in the
e\e. a snarp. sickening, stabbing pain in the back or joints, which never ceases day nor night.
Ihe tightly-drawn mouth is that af a man resigned to his fate, thinking he is incurable.
1 :ie general appearance of the face spells bodily weakness and irritability. You probably
know many such kidney sufferers whose faces look just the same as this man's does.
If you suffer from kidney trouble in any form, rheumatism, gout, sciatica, lumbago.
&tone, gra\el. oackache. or any such symptoms as headache, sediment in urine, bad taste in
the mouth, burning sensation at neck of bladder, puffiness under the eves, be sure weakened
kidneys are at the bottom of it ail.
Ihe kidneyact as filters in the body, and make impure blood into good, pure, healthy
blood, and if tour kidneys do not do their work properly vou are beinsr slowly poisoned.
That acid poison is the cause of the pain. De Witt's Kidney and Bladder Pills strengthen
the kidneys and drive the poisonous pain-causing acid risrht out of the system. Every
suffering reader of this paper can prove for himself, with just one or two doses of De Witt '
Pi s. that they do touch the weak spot—the kidnevs and bladder.
To cure kidney trouble of any kind you must positively get rid of the cause the
Tv.isonous uric acid. To do this a real remedy and pmss through the kidneys and bladder
and not through the bowels, as most Kidney Pills do. When you see the urine change into
a muddy bluish color —the feature which distinguishes De Witt's Pills from all others vou
know, beyond all doubt, that they have pur their healing touch on the right soot the kidnevs
and the bladder. De Witt's Pills are wonderful little pills, for thev go straight to the
kidneys, then to the bladder, that is the reason why you get such amazingly quick relief
every time. A permanent cure follows in almost every case. Don’t take someone's word for
it. Prove it for vourself.

Oh!

Business, Robbery, etc.
When Henry E. Surface, “wood products
expert.” of Wisconsin. C.S.A.. was brought
to Tasmania recently to report on the mak-
ing of wood pulp and paper out of the
Speck's trees, he turned the idea down
with a slam. But since he returned to his
own country he has been busy testing the
woods for the distillation of alcohol, and
finds that they give better results than the
beech, birch and maple mostly used for the
purpose in the U.S.A. If the yields of wood
alcohol, acetate of lime and charcoal from
an equal mixture of beech, birch and maple
heart-wood be taken as 100, eucalyptus
slab-wood goes one better all round as fol-
lows : Wood alcohol. 121 ; acetate of lime,
11S.1; charcoal. 140. He considers that, in
view of his tests, there is every possibility
of a valuable industry being established in
distilling alcohol from eucalyptus wood, and
adds that the Tasmanian myrtle or beech,
which is closely related to the American
beech, but is a denser and heavier wood,
ought to give excellent results.

"Myall": I agree with “Cripps Clark”
(B. 10/12/T5) that co-operative shearing
and wool marketing for cockies is unwork-
able. “W.C.M.” states that “similar sheep
on similar country produce similar wind.”
>v> they do. but “W.C.M.” seems to have
lost sight of the fact that there is a great
difference of opinion among sheepbreeders
and woolgrowers as to the best blood to use
when laying the foundation of a flock, some
favoring the fine, evenly-marked wool of
the Wauganella type, while others prefer
big. bold-stapled, medium-quality wools. If
two cockies selected their sheep from the
same station their flocks might produce sim-
ilar wool for one season, but after that one
man by careful culling and the introduction
of the right blood from time to time might
improve his clip, while his neighbor, by
letting things go as they please, would find
that his had deteriorated. Again, one by
regular dipping may keep his flocks free
from sheep-louse and ticks, thus ensuring a
good clip, whilst his neighbor allows his
sheep to become infested, to the detriment
of the wool. During the present season I
have handled clips of stations where the
soil and conditions were similar and the
prices obtained varied as much as 4d. per
lb. Wool brokers when offering the clip
of a big station find it necessary to cut up
one class of wool, say first combing, into
many different lots, so unequal is the wool
from the different paddocks.
* * * »
‘‘Sheep Ho”: I am in the same corner as
“W.C.M.” on this scheme for a co-operative
shearing and wool marketing. Of course it
can be done, in spite of “Cripps Clark” and
his chuckling ridicule. In fact, it is done,
or at least the marketing is, by the wool
repackers in the various cities of the Com-
monwealth. The difference is that they re-
ceive the cash that the cockies lose by not
adopting the scheme. I have for five years
classed and put together wool from flocks
grown in different parts of X. S. Wales.
These sheep were purchased in the wool and
shorn “in flocks” on a Monaro station. The
squattah lost nothing on the joke. He kept
at it till he made his pile. In a pastoral
district the wool grown is invariably of the
same color, which is the only requisite for
the success of the scheme. The scheme may
be divided into (a) the shearing, (b) the
classing and matching of sorts, (c) the book-
keeping. As for the shearing, small flocks
belonging to different owners' are shorn now
at a great number of sheds by stations and
contractors, and no one is prostrated at the
idea. Any competent classer can grade
merino wool into (say) six lines of fleece
and make the lines fairly even as regards
length, color and condition, even if some of
it does come from different paddocks. The
sorting of the skirtings could be done on
the same lines as at au ordinary shearing,
with the exception that short and burry lots
would be kept apart. The book-keeping is
not nearly so formidable as it looks. This
is how it could be run. A is credited with:
3 bales (numbers given) in No. 1 bin.
2 bales and. say, 501 b. in No. 2 bin.
4 bales and. say, 401 b. in No. 3 bin.
And so on for B and C. The weighing
would give no trouble. It might surprise
‘‘Cripps Clark” to learn that every pound
of wool on some of the largest stations in
Queensland is put on the scales before it
goes into the press.
♦ * * •
“Croson”: One of the best Melbourne
shows now is to watch the buyers for vari-
ous stores come in the hollow-ware and
crockery, warehouses and try to hook things
they badly want but can't get. That is
to say, it's funny if you aren't a buyer
yourself. Blivins and Co. were lucky
enough to receive a couple of cases of sauce-
pans last week, and forthwith every other
firm’s buyer slipped in and tried to wheedle
a few pots out of them. But Blivins doesn't
know when hell get any more, and his
regular retail customers want them, so he
became as full of excuses as a war-corres-
pondent. If William isn't hanged for another
year this country is going to learn one lesson
properly; that is, to make things itself. By
then the housewife will have to boil the old
man’s breakfast eggs in a jam-tin, and when
the china gets broken he’ll have to dine off
a tin plate and drink out of a pannikin. Yet
years ago I saw. at the same Blackburn pot-
tery that is now making insulators, some of
the most beautiful ware I ever clapped eyes
ou—teacups, teapots and vases; thin and
light they were as aluminium, yet they rang
like steel. We can make these things all
right, but we don’t. Hughes aud Tudor

"D.F.”: L. M. Shoobridge. president of
the Tasmanian Fruitgrowers' Union, lias
come back from a six months' visit to the
I’aeific States of U.S.A. convinced that to
make a real success of their business Aus-
tralian fruitgrowers must follow the Ameri-
c-au example and co-operate iu handling and
distributing their crop. He says they want
to replace the present individualist system
of packing apples by central sheds which
will handle all the fruit of the district, a
method which is being adopted to some
extent in the new fruitgrowing districts in
the north of Tas. This gives a big output
of fruit of uniform grading and packing,
The sheds are owned entirely by the
growers themselves, who have in many
parts of Western America pretty well elimi-
nated the middlemen from the distributing
business. Some of the Tasmanian growers
have tried to do the same and started an
office in Sydney in order to do without the
agents. but they haven't got much support
so far. mostly because Sydney hasn’t any
idea they are there.

stop the false description of lands offered

as when the subject was first mentioned,
Every subdivision ought to be guaranteed

but there ought to be little difficulty about

as a fencing timber and finds that it stands
as well as most others. It seems to be one
of the oldest inhabitants of the Australian
bush and I some time ago came across several

At a recent meeting of the Royal Society in Mel-

which give rise to abnormalities in plants. “In
addition, too. plants often appear to have a deficient
growth memory, and to be unable to remember the
proper way for them to grow."

A Clean,
Dustless
F acftory,
with
® Motor Drive 3!
You can avoid all overhead line shafts and flapping belts, eliminating danger, dirt
and disorder, by adopting efficient B.T-H. or G-E motor drive for your factory.
Much better working conditions for your operatives is one of the inevitable results
of electric motor-drive. You will have better natural light when vou have banished over-
head shafting. The dust, dirt and noise of flapping belts and revolving pulleys and fly-
wheels is absent as well as the danger of injury from these sources.
Satisfied employees mean greater efficiency and less loss from spoiled work, with
consequent higher production. Other important advantages and economies of B.T-H.
or G-E motor-drive are discussed in bulletin No. 48010. Send for your copy.

IMPORTANT
Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort, and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
find water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Itough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
nre too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi-
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA i* therefore regarded as "the
perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

FOR BILIOUSNESS

°- Bramte Creek. Mareeba. Q.. “to the
emcacy of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
as a splendid medicine for the relief of
biliousness. I lirst saw the testimony of
other Mareeba residents some 12 months

POLITICAL
POINTS
London Morning Post, reviewing Dr. J.
M. Creed's book of recollections, commends
him for contending that “the White Aus-
tralia policy should not be applied to areas
wholly unsuitable for white settlement,
despite the opposition of Australian Labor-
ites, whose deity is constructed in the form
of a gigantic figure eight.” Well, that’s
better than innumerable little xxxx. The
sign of the cross can very well be left to
their opponents; for Australian Laborites it
will be quite enough to continue to take pride
in the purity of their »cce.
THE TAXPAYERS' TOPHET.
From Sydney Telegraph (5/1/'l6):
STATE BORROWING.
FRESH LOAN OF £2,000,000.
Fresh! Well, that's some sort of recom-
mendation. The last several lots have
stunk.
Listen to the glad words of Prime Minis-
ter Hughes:—
This Government believes it is its duty to smooth
the path for Australia in developing her almost
infinitely varied resources.
And one way of not doing it is to import
from the land of abundant Notes a number-
of steel cars for use on the East-West rail-
way. They haven’t actually been imported
.vet, but certain persons seem determined
they shall be if it can be compassed.
There are still plenty of reasons why the
Greater Sydney scheme should be pushed on,
even if it is regarded by some people as a
patriotic duty to be absolutely idle till' the
shooting stops. The width of a road divides
Parramatta from Merrylands, and the prac-
tice has grown up of hurling Parramatta
rubbish across the street, that it may cease
to be a burden on the municipality. Merry-
lands is a dependency, colony or other off-
shoot of Prospect and Sherwood, and now
the aldermen of the dirt-invaded territory
are threatening reprisals. They have made
representations to Parramatta that its dirt-
cart ought to collect the refuse, otherwise
the dead cat and insanitary jamtin may be
hurled back ; and if the trouble isn’t settled
by fusion, neutral travellers that way are
liable to be taken in the right cheek by the
thing of scorn heaved from Prospect and in
the left by the carcase of opprobrium pro-
pelled from Parramatta.
Holman has just tapped J. Bull for
another couple of millions, to keep Norton
Griffiths and Co. supplied with commission
apparently; and it is incidentally mentioned
that there is “some criticism in London at
the action of the Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer allowing the issue.... to compete
with the war borrowings.” It hasn’t been
mentioned, how’ever, that there is no
authority in Australia to head off the rush
to the pawnshop either at home or abroad.
Before the end of the month it looks as
though George Reid will be a member of the
House of Commons for Hanover Square—a
division of London where the fatted calf is
brought in by the butler at some of the best
dinners in the country. The job just suits Aus-
tralia’s champion Y’es-No. He is the Union-
ist candidate without belonging to the Union-
ist party; he is to support tlie Government,
and the Government represents both sides;
and he yesnoes with regard to domestic
measures, such things not being properly
debatable in this crisis, he says. Gibson
Bowles, the naval bullant, threatened onno-
sition, but evidently it was whispered into
his ear that “our brave Australians” would
regard it as an unfriendly act, so he retired.
George’s selection and election will, it is
put, be a compliment paid to Australia. The
best that Australia can wish is that it had
been handed to a man who had some reason-
able sympathy with Australian ideals.
George Reid never had, and never will have.
P.M.G. Webster is allowing
his imagination to go sweeping
the dark spaces like a comet’s
tail. He wants to turn the
motor-service business into a
public monopoly and link it up
to the Post Office. Of course
he doesn’t want to do it all to-
morrow, but he puts the sugges-
tion up as a “problem in evolu-
tion” deserving earnest investi-
gation. It may be a good idea.
Meanwhile The Bulletin, with
a view to keeping things on the
rails, suggests that the immedi-
ate problem for Webster to evo-
lute is concealed in the half-
million a year the Australian
Post Office is losing. When
Webster has shown that the
Post Office can made a decent
job of one lot of monopoly, the
time will be getting ripe to
earnestly investigate a proposal
to give it a bit more to handle.
But in the interval 175 fleets of
motor-cars carrying mails and
passengers wouldn’t give Web-
ster any assistance in sending a
telegram, or finding the one that
was lost; nor would it make the
suffering caused by trying to use
one of his telephones any less
acute. And as that is where
most of the loss occurs, it
seems a sensible thing to investigate just
there, for a start.
When Beeby, late Minister for Lands,
returns from America to N. S. Wales, the
Progressive Party, whose young hopes the
last State elections scattered to the winds,
will probably make another start with -an
idea of sweeping Mother off her feet at the
next general election. Sundry enthusiasts
who cannot agree or are disappointed with
the Labor Party but cannot stomach Wade
are already moving, and Beeby issued a sort
of rallying call before he left. * But although
the career of the Government which Labor
Put into power to do its work has been a
gloomy failure the irruption of another
party hardly looks like a cure for existing
things. The debt-stricken land wants more
patriotism and less —not more—party.
“It is important that 1 should know by
„ * , V 1 airaiiahlp ”
the I itli how many men ai.e at a •
Well, j-es, as it happened to be the 1 rime
Minister of Australia who was speaking, and
the inquiry was in reference to the carrying
« * war for national existence, it
does seem reasonably important. Ot comse
it didn’t really matter IS months ago. The
slaughter had only started then, and an
enlightened country can surelj’ be allowed to
kill and waste a few hundred thousand of its
best before it proceeds to find out just where
it is, so that it may organise things.
REWARDING THEIR VALOR.
‘“My noble and heroic -Servian people, you are worthy of liberty. Therefore, return to your homes,
customs and labors.” —The Kaiser to "my"’ Servian people.
Love for the Greenback and devotion to
the Note are apparently the . same attach-
ment described different ways.
\Y. E. Slioobridge, a very well-known Tas-
manian hop-grower and dryer, throws in-
teresting lighten the (largely-bogus) attempt
to shut out German trade without nutting
up a tariff wall. He is prepared to swear
that actually during the war German hops
are coming into Australia through Wilson’s
country. He says that, owing to the differ-
ence in the methods of preparing and drying,
any hopping expert can easily tell the
Bavarian hops from any hops produced in
U.S.A., and that the dried vegetables now
coming from America are Bavarians right
enough. The Saaz process, used by himself
and some other Tasmanian hop-growers,
turns out hops which very closely resemble
the Bavarian, and can be used for the same
purposes; but in at least one case he has
lost the sale of a big parcel of Saaz hops
because the prospective buyer got hold of a
cheap line of enemy goods, via America.
At a time when Australia should be cap-
turing the trade of the enemy the factories
in N. S. Wales last year actually showed a
decrease of 75 establishments, 2751 male
employees and 1204 females. Certainly
there was an increase in the value of output;
and tbe value of plant and machinery in-
creased by nearly two million pounds. But
the increases in values occurred chiefly in
regard to such things as heat, light and
power. In the matter of putting a local
toiler into the place of the foreign person the
State seems actually to have gone back-
wards, and a larger proportion of the people
than before are living on the useless job of
handling things made by other people, in-
cluding all sorts of foreign cheap people
without Factory Acts.
“Ricardo”: The Australian Baby Bonus
is seriously discussed in Germany as an
example of the way things should be done.
The philosophers, however, headed by the
Chief Statist, Professor Wolf, want to put it
on in a different way. Their idea is about
£l5 for every fifth child, with rising values
for all that come after. “Useful bribery,”
says Wolf. The declining birthrate gives
concern, coupled with the war abattoir.
Germany increases only 800.000 a year; Rus-
sia increases 14,000,000. And, besides, Ger-
many’s birthrate per thousand was formerly
40, and now is only 2S. “If we win,” says
the statist, “with such figures we can’t
hold !”
“D.F.” on a recent Tasmanian scuffle:—
The observations of “Oboe” (B. 30/12/’lo) miss
the point of my par. about Whitsitt, M.H.A. and
the Defence Department. What I said was that
the Department either should have turned the glassy
eye on Whitsitt’s allegations about returned soldiers
being scurvily treated, or, if it thought them worth
investigation, should have had a full public inquiry
into the thing. The Department did neither; it
took Whitsitt seriously enough to rush Senator Jim
Long over to hold an inquiry, but that inquiry wasn’t
open to the public or the press, and was farcical.
Long merely spent a couple of hours or so going
into the matter in camera. From other evidence
it would appear that he was mostly right in finding
that At hitsitt was mostly wrong, but the Department
should have handled the thing in the straight-out
and above-board manner which would have been more
satisfactory for everybody.
“Searchlight” on the need to do things: ■
I am another shopkeeper who has blushed so much
at the quality of the goods that have to be offered
since the war that I have acquired a permanent
ruddiness. One is afraid to mention prices, but a
line of accordions at £2 10s. make the gods weep
when the poreclain keys refuse to stay in their pro-
per places. I used to be able to sell a well-made
German line at 255. Why in the name of all that’s
worth cursing cannot this country produce things as
good as the murdering Hun? Many people would
not object to high prices, but they naturally expect
reasonable value. And, anyhow, what is the use of
me yelling out, “Buy Australian manufactures!”
when they are not for sale? Moreover, what in the
name of Gallipoli is the use of substituting goods
produced by a new foreigner for the stuff the old
one supplied? Can't we even make a toy cart for the
kid, or is the politician the only thing we can pro-
duce? Seems to me it is for us as a nation to
knock off yelling and get down to work. Bv the
way—are we a nation?
The daylight-saving fad hasn’t quite fin-
ished its run yet. Tasmania, whose Parha-
mPnt is more willing to try experiments
t^aQ mos t, thinks this a proper time to dis-
cuss the matter, the world having no other
serious problems on hand. A select coni-
’fir o°/««e,“aS
hag nQw reported that it would 5e an excel .
J ent sc ] ieme if a il the clocks were put for-
-ward an hour at the beginning of October
and kept an hour fast all summer. Giblin,
M.H.A., haying no children of his own, has
fathered this one, and there s no great risk
of either House taking it off his hands.
Elwood Mead, one of the best overseas
specialists Australia ever hired, has been
poking borax at Australia’s habit of import-
ing experts. He has been telling the Western
American settlers that, before he came on tin-
scene, Victoria knew more about the busi-
ness than America knows even now. Vic-
toria grants irrigated blocks on extended
terms, builds settlers’ houses on extended
payments, grades and even seeds the land
and provides expert supervision, so that
the settler starts properly and makes a
comfortable living inside one year. The
U.S.A., according to Mead, sells irrigated
holdings to about three men in succession—-
when they can be snared. The first two
usually spend their capital and labor and
then have to walk out; the third gets the
benefit of their work and mostly succeeds.
This fact is becoming so well known in
Nevada, Wisconsin and other adjacent
States that land agents have great difficulty
in finding buyers for new blocks, though
their commission runs up to 25 and 30 per
cent! To anyone who knows the ways of
Yankee Private Enterprise there is nothing
surprising about this; the humor lies in the
fact that A ictoria should have paid a man
a high salary to come and gain information
so that he might go back and teach his
fellow-countrymen the better way that he
had learnt.
DRIVEN TO IT.
THE TERRIER: “Plucky thing you did, goin ’
out and fetchin' that feller in.”
THE KANGAROO: "Yes, the careless cow! He
had me tohaccer."
Money has to be found now for extensive
alterations to N. S. Wales Parliament
House. Ladies, have lately been employed
to type the private correspondence of the
weary M.L.A., who charges up her services
to the country along with the cost of the
glass of whisky in which he drinks the health
ot a fellow member off to the Front. These
lady typists have increased so greatly in
number that they are getting uppish, and
demand more accommodation. So the
shambling old edifice in Macquarie-street is
to be tittivated up some more to provide
appropriate boudoirs for the lady helps.
GOD DA—BLESS THE SHEEP!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
God bless the sheep! His stupid “Ba-ar”
Is heard in wiser lands afar,
And foreigners pour out their gold
For ficeey treasures from the fold.
So, as the wool-teams strain and.creep,
Australia cries, “God bless the sheep!”
■God bless the sheep! He walks about
Eating the grass and growing stout;
A flock, a dog and one dazed clown
Will keep a squatter drunk in town,
While chorus girls about him leap,
The whole year round. “God bless the sheep !
God damn the sheep ! Why must he graze
Upon locked pastures all our days,
And kdep the people from the soil?
Oh, you that in lean places toil,
Do you not pray before you sleep:
“Oh, damn the squatter’s blasted, sheep! ”
God damn the sheep that makes a man
The lord and owner of a clan—
That leaves a province void of men
Till shearing-time comes round again,
And sweating men with shear-blades reap
The harvest of the Boss's sheep.
God damn the sheep! Yet bless them, too!
They help to pay our lOU.
In peace or war, from shed and field,
We haul the sovereigns that they yield,
While we the Cohen tribe must keep,
We dare not damn the gilt-edged sheep.

THE USES OF TONICS.
Tonics are remedies which gradually
restore the various bodily organs, muscles
and nerve cells from a lax and sluggish state
to one making them capable of normal activ-
ity. Tonics impart a sense of increased well-
being and strength. They are not to be con-
fused with stimulants, which may give an
immediate false strength. There are tonics
for the nerves, blood and stomach, but un-
doubtedly the most useful is one having a
combined effect and generally benefiting the
system. Tonics are the most widely used of
all medicines. In all forms of weakness,
"'hen energy and vitality are needed, when
the blood is thin and weak, and when the
nerves are run down and have lost their
tone, a tonic is prescribed. Amongst tonics
thfi best known is the much spoken of 1 )r.
” illiams’ Pink Pills. These pills have
established a high reputation as a blood
builder and nerve tonic. They make the
thin blood rich and red, carry nourishment
to weak and inflamed nerves, increase the
appetite and make digestion normal, correct
sleeplessness and most forms of headaches.
Iry them for any trouble caused by thin
blood or weak nerves, such as anaemia, rheu-
matism, neuralgia, sciatica, lumbago, indi-
gestion, sick headache or St. Vitus’s dance.
f»et a box of I)r. Williams’ Pink Tills at

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The Federated Bookmakers’ Association
must be feeling sorry that it insisted on the retire-
ment of handidapper Maitland. The arrogant licensed
bagmen have done more than set the bellows of
public opinion blowing at the smouldering file oi
tote agitation. They have directed attention to the
fact that the Y.R.C. has employed a paid servant of
Ikey Mo as judge of races on which I key Mo bet s.
A horse-owner in Victoria wrote to the Age last
week protesting against this “anomaly.” If the
F.B.A. can make good with an objection to a parti-
cular handieapper, it is quite time that the public
“should object to anyone holding the portion of
secretary to a bookmakers’ club whilst officiating in
the judge's box.” Ye gods, it is quite time! Any
judge is able to make a mistake in deciding a close
finish between a red-hot favorite and a rank out-
sider. And a judge who happened to make a mistake
in favor of the "public’s fancy as against the nag
that would have been a “skinner ’ for Ikev would
not long remain the paid secretary of Ikey s^club.
The totalisator in South Aus. has again
come under the eye of Government as an easy \vay of
making a bit of revenue. For many years after its
adoption the Kaeing Club holding the meeting was
authorised by law to retain i 4 per cent, of all sums
invested in the machine. A few years hack Govern-
ment stepped in and legislated that 10 per cent,
should be deducted, itself collaring the extra 24. Now
the total deduction is to be 121 per cent., of which
the State gets 5 per cent. That is, of every pound
invested. Government gets a shilling, and the Racing
Club eighteenpence. A racegoer who _ invests a
modest sovereign on each of seven events in an after-
noon can reckon —if bettors ever stop to reckon—
that he has contributed 17s. 6d. to one body or the
other. In the circumstances, a suggestion is being
made that investors should no longer be deprived of
their “fractions.” The machine has long found it
too much trouble to calculate beyond the nearest
-hilling, and ha without any obvious legal right to
do it—retained the odd coppers. They mount up; a
mere 500 tickets on a winner may mean anything up
to £25 retained. These fractions are apportioned
among charities: in particular, a strong fund for
disabled jockeys has been built up out of them.
But as it really makes very little difference to a
winner whether he collects £7 13s. or £7 13s. 6d.,
the old plan is not likely to be altered.

No doubt drought lo ses were a factor in this
buttoning-up, but the Great Scrap is beginning to
have a grim aspect, and racecourse betting is bound
to be more curtailed as war proceeds. So far, how-
ever, the people are mostly buttoning-up because
through war sorrows they don’t feel cheerful enough
to splash inonev at races. Later on, when instead
of wallowing in war-loan expenditure we have to
start paying back, the figures will shrink simply
through shortage of money. At present the shortage
is a pure myth. There probably never was >o much
coin available for beer and skittles in Sydney as at
present; and tbree of the other capitals are not iar
behind.

Balboa, winner of tbe Auckland (M.L.)
Cup, the biggest stake in Maoriland, was one of the
purchases of his trainer, F. Davis, that turned out
trumps. Davis, who was for many years priwnpal
jockey for J. D. Ormond, captured the animal for
£3O, and passed it on to his patron T. H. Lowry,
lie seems to have a knack of picking up nags that
are worth feeding. At a yearling sale a few year-
ago he collected an unlikely looking brute for a
few pounds, ami after keeping him for a few months
sold him at a fair profit to Lowry. That horse was
Bobrikoff, who won many thousands for Lowry in
Australia and Maorilaml. and was one of the greatest
gallopers ever saddled in the Loanly Isles. Balboa
is by Yarco, imported bv J. B. Reid, and bought at
the Elderslie clearing sale by Rou-e Bros, ot N.S.n.

Ikey has his troubles, too. and one of him
met with a terrible mishap the other day in Sydney.
He was going out to take a little fresh air in a
motor-car and carried his loose change with him.
This, a mere matter of £7OO. mostly in gpsi, was
casuallv deposited in the stern, and Ikey decorated
the front ami waved the chauffeur on. Half an hour
later thev pulled up, and Ike went to borrow tup-
pence off himself, and —well, a groan of agony rent
the atmosphere, and the car was turned upside down
and examined with a microscope and through 2. tele-
phones and the whole neighborhood dashed off as a
search partv. The beautiful beans had vanished, leaving
not a clue behind except a small hole in the bottom
of the car through which, in the opinion of the
force, the cash had bolted. Of course, only a hard-
working toiler at lavin’ ’em would have made such a
fuss about a trifle. Any punter could drop
700 quid through a hole in his motor-car without
giving it a second thought.
Long before Fred Gilmore (imp.) and
Tommy Uren shaped up at Sydney Stadium on Satur-
day the stranger was reckoned a good thing, and
Ikey had been laying against the Australian at 2 to
1. Gilmore came with a big reputation. His train-
ing had been attractive. He had almost half a stone
the better of the weight, for under him the scales
almost touched the welter limit of lOst. 71b., and
Uren couldn’t register lOst. And when they came
together it still looked good, for Gilmore had great
advantage in height and a long lead in reach. For
the first two rounds the bigger man held his own,
and then he didn’t do it any more, for Thomas took
a hand in the game and asserted himself with an
emphatic right and frequent visitations to the ear
and chin in the clinches. From that on it was Uren s
bacon. He outboxed and outfought the other in
nearly every round, and at the end of the fray the
referee’s job was easy. Gilmore's greater elevation
alone saved him from the clout that ends all argu-
ment, for though Uren’s right came over time after
time —and it is a punch of exceeding swiftness and
weight—it always missed the spot by an inch or so.
Uren put up a plucky, willing performance, and
showed marked improvement, especially in footwork,
since his last appearance at the Stadium. Gilmore
disappointed everyone, including himself perhaps.
Clabby, who was in his corner, reckons his man was
stale. Perhaps so. At any rate he boxed like a pug
who was thinking of something else. His left was a
useful instrument, but his right might just as well
have been in Chicago. The queerest thing about Gil-
more was that he didn’t look like a ring man. He
might do better as a middleweight, but has yet to
show he is any more than a gym- boxer.

George Taylor brought a new punch to
light in his clash with Frank Ellis on Saturday night
at Melbourne Stadium. It was a commendable inno-
vation and the inventor demonstrated its value in the
many clinches. It took the shape of a right-handed
clout that travelled up and over Ellis’s head and
downward, landing on the enemy’s right ear, and
from the ninth round it was only a matter of how
long the fly-flapper would hold out. The end came
in the eleventh session, when the damaged ear burst
and bled freely. Ellis, who was out of trim and
a good deal lighter than his opponent, thereupon
gave the argument best.
ARTHUR WRIGHT, Sporting Novelist.
Fritz Holland cleaned up Xicol Simpson,
ilie English middleweight, in good style at Brisbane
cc Saturday, the towel coming in during the
eighth. Fritz's next mission is to impress Mick
King with a proper respect tor his bald head, and
Michael has sped away to Bananaland to see about
the matter.
“Sardonyx”: The Darey-McGoorty fight
has set pugdom talking about "the Indian sign,’’
which may be taken to mean the moral disadvantage
under which a fighter labors when confronting for
the second time an opponent who has already decis-
ively beaten him. This condition may be roughly.
characterised as nervousness ; but it must not be for-
gotten that extreme nerve-disturbance under certain
conditions is quite compatible with unimpeachable
courage. None of the greatest fighters in the hi-tory
of the ring have been of a notably brutal type. Jem
Ward, the unbeaten champion of England in the
early ISOO's, was a skilful artist, an accomplished
musician and a very fine singer. Jem Belcher, the
greatest fist-fighter the world has even seen, was a
rather slightly-built middleweight, of prepossessing
appearance and kindly disposition. Yet he donkey-
licked again and again the formidable Joe Berks, a
heavyweight of immense strength, brutal ferocity and
very considerable skill. Still, a third, Jem Mace,
whom I knew well, used to say that, if qualifications
were pretty equal otherwise, he always expected to
make more of a nervy pupil. “Nerves mostly mean
brains, y’see; and I haven't much use for a chap as
hasn’t a head on him as well as things t' poonch
wi’.” No one would have suspected Mace himself
of nerves, but I had it from him that he had always
felt “a bit shiggly,” as he culled it, during the early
rounds of a fight, and that it was nerves and not Bob
Bret tie that sent him down in the first of his long
list of battles. Such stiff propositions, also, as Mick
Boole v and Steve O’Donnell made no secret of the
fact that they were always very nervous in begin-
ning ; and the late “Ironbark Jim’’ Burge once con-
fided to me that he generally had cold feet at the
start of a fight, “though,” he added, with a grin,
“towards the end I mostly swaps ’em with the
other fellow.”
Eugene Corri had something to sav on this sub-
ject not long back when eulogising the courage of
French boxers. -More often than not, . s , al -'
“thev are highly-strung and sensitive, but that is
just ‘the type that very often does the most heroic
things in the ring.”
“Pug”: Jimmy Clabby is a good boxer
and a good sport. Marion T. Salazar, in an Amen-
can paper, publishes the following: ‘ Our cun}-
topped friend, Jimmy Clabby. has no excuse to one
for the rough handling he received at the hands ot
Les Darcy. ‘lf there is any excuse to make, writes
James, ‘let it be that Darcy is a much cleverer
boxer than I thought him to be. \\ hen I first
arrived in Australia many persons told me that ne
was not clever, but I found it almost impossible to
hit him. On the other hand, he has a way all ms
own of hitting you with both hands simultaneously.
But what struck me most wonderful of all is his
immense strength. He is like a heavyweight,
course, I wish to meet him again. But never again
will I let people tell me he can't box. It Darcy
isn’t a clever man, lie is the best imitation of one
I ever saw or heard of.’ ”
* * * *
“Mujik”: It is amusing to read that at
the second affray McGoorty fought in much better
form against Darcv than he did in the first disturb-
ance. The first‘lasted 15 rounds, and right up
to the burial McGoorty looked good enough to win
by the short cut if lie could laud the wallop. The
second lasted seven and a bit, and at no time offer
the first clash was there the slightest doubt about
what was going to happen. In fact, McGoorty showed
such “improvement” that half-way through he didn t
know what to do. The fact is the American held
Darcy a bit cheap before the first unpleasantness, and
towards the last let up a bit in his-
thing he is always inclined to do, for to him train-
ing is a miserable period of penance. W hen he got
into the ring he found his mistake and learned the
lesson of his life, for Darcv made some of his work
look even cheaper than Jeff Smith did nearly a
couple of years ago. For the second try-out McGoorty
trained hard and thoroughly. He knew he had to.
But the showing he made was no better. McGoorty
was, anyhow, never any more than a one-punch
swinger, and, though it is a desperately hard clout
he carries, once it is mastered he is done. Likewise
the jolt, if it is not mastered, is very painful. This
smite McGoorty landed flush to Darcy’s jaw, and
when it didn't move the kid's head, the fraction of
an inch or stop him coming on, I’ll bet twopence
McGoorty knew he was licked. His subsequent tactics
showed this plainly, for using the left hook on the
reverse-gear is merelv calling tenders for trouble.
* * * *
“Montalex”: Rc Bulletin references to
Jem Mace and his famous battle (in 1861.) with
Sam Hurst, known, because he stood 6ft. 4in. and
weighed 19st., as the Stalevbridge Infant? Trained
to the last ounce, Hurst scaled 16st., so that Mace
was giving away 5-t. and 6in., and. the assembled
thousands of “Lankies” and “Cheskies” had come
condescendingly prepared to witness the demolition
of the audacious little East-Anglian. They were
disappointed. The fight was all Mace’s way, and after
two hours of terrific punishment, for which he gave
little or no return, the giant collapsed, letting his
backers in for a huge amount of money in “long-
shots” of as high as 50, 70 and even 100 to 1.
“Eryander”: “C.G.” (B. 23/12/To) is
right and “Sardonyx” wrong. Mace did lose to
King: that defeat, however, being one of the only
two “the Gipsy” suffered out of nearly 500 encoun-
ters. King, it should be remembered, was a 74in.
170-pounder, yet Mace, an 11-stoner of 691 in., after-
wards most conclusively turned the tables on him. But
it took him 43 rounds of hard fighting to beat the
big man to a standstill, and then, through having
sprained his right wrist, he was unable to put over
the “sleeper.”
* * * *
“.ED.”: The late “Cocker” Tweedie, pro-
bably the cleverest Australian boxer since the days
of the incomparable Griffo, was as full of fun as a
monkey. On one occasion he received a great fright.
He was in the habit when “on the road” to stop
suddenly before a telegraph-post, do some shadow-
sparring, and then pass on. Some of his Balmain
friends (Cocker trained in the vicinity of Callan
Park) conspired with friends of theirs to “jug”
him. Accordingly one day, as he was pranc-
ing round a post hitting at an imaginary opponent,
several people rushed him, secured his hands and
then marched him off to the asylum. Cocker expos-
tulated excitedly: “Blime, I ain't a lunatic.” (No
notice taken.) “I say, yous blokes! Gorblime, I
ain’t a blankety idjet. See!” “That’s what all
you lunatics say when you get nabbed; hut we're
fly to your game,” chirped one of the warders as
they popped him in amongst a lot of the real
McKays for four hours. When released Cocker
bolted, and never stopped till he got home, dripping
with perspiration. In relating his experience to one
of his friends (who was in the joke) the pug said:
“I tell yer straight and all. another four hours,
and, blime, I'd been a permanent boarder.”
* * * *
•Tust-about-the-top middle-weight Aliearn
(a Lancashire lad) may probably be in Australia
soon to argue the point with Darcy. If the young-
ster can account for him he will unquestionably be
the world's champion. The crown that Gibbons wears
is onlv make-believe.

A fine enthusiast disappeared when J.
tV. Porter retired from the Victorian Rifle Associa-
tion. Porter has been a range-officer since 1875—-
three years at Middle Park and 37 at 'Williamstown —
and has not missed a Saturday at one or the other
in 40 rears.

Sydney batsmen made bowlers and fields-
men jump on Saturdav. The liveliest performance
took place on the University Oval, where the war-
weakened school team was leathered to a standstill
by Petersham, who scored 585 for only three wickets.
(Pause here for a lorg. cool restorer.) It was a
massacre. J. M. Taylor, who is in great nick, and
T. «T. E. Andrews ornamented the score-book with
240 runs for the second wicket. Andrews was
responsible for 232 not out. and young Taylor made
174. A. W. Xorris helped the ’Varsity hoys to some
physical culture in the field by larruping the howl-
ing for 77. Old Sundries’ lot totalled 48. Andrews
- : picture at the crease, and by dashing play ran
up 200 runs in 124 mini’tes: the time for his total
was 149 minutes. Taylors time was 166 minutes.
At Pratten Park, against Western Suburbs. Waverley
accumulated 369 in the find innings by consistent
batting. Carter topped the list with 75. Eight
batsmen scored thus: 75. 27. 32. 51. 37. 54. 41. 40.
Similar consistency was shown by Middle Harbor in
its first innings against Glebe. The first eight men
to bat made 27, 40. 20. 21. 35. 37. 39. 25. The
total was 272. Of the day's bowlers G. V. Grim-
mett. for Sydnev. bagged eight for 60 from Balmain,
and in the same match Emerson put an end to the
exertions of five Sydney batsmen at a cost of 14
runs.
* * * *
The scoring in the first-grade Svdnev
cricket matches or. Satwrdav was most unusual. All
the teams completed the first innings but one. an
uncommon percentage, the exception being Petersham.
Nothing in the wav of a serious premiership is hang-
irg to this year's competition, so Petersham next
Saturday might be advised not to “close.” but to go
on for a record score. Still, it has only a battling
tail to support Tom Andrews (232 n. 0.).
Petersham's 555 for the loss of three wickets
in 226 minutes on Saturday recalls Padding-
ton's 61? for nine wickets against Red fern at Reel-
fern Oval in Jarnarv. 1963. The late Victor Tr’up-
per (335. three hours) and the now-veteran Dan Gee
j (172) set the ball rolling with 423 for the first
wicket. Trumper had just returned from England,
where in the wettest season on record he scored 2570
runs and notched 11 centuries. On the Friday night
previous to scoring that 335 Victor was in bed at
7 30, leg-wearv. Yet next day he electrified the
cricket world by playing a most brilliant innings.
The writer holds the view, and it is shared bv
Trumper, sen., that the heavy work of that 1902
English tour was the undoing of Victor. He was
never quite right afterwards.
* * * *
Tommy Andrews, who smote 232 not out
(the best score of Sydney grade cricket this season),
keeps his muscles tightened with strenuous sport.
In summer he is a vigorous cricketer, and in the
winter swats the horsehide for Petersham in Sydney
baseball. In both pastimes he has had a place in the
rep teams. If we had conscription we would know
that so fit an Australian had good reasons for being
where he is. Under the voluntary system the better
athlete you prove a man who hasn’t enlisted, the
more vou are likely to get him despised.

Auckland (MX.) Grammar School re-
cently went down to Christchurch in pursuit of the
lleatiicote William Shield held by the Boys’ High
School. The Northerners won the toss, and, although
the wicket was perfect and the weather splendid,
for some unexplained reason they sent the opposition,
in. The High School scratched up a paltry 56, and
then Auckland went to the sticks and biffed up 408,
the top-scorer being A. E. Irving (130) and the
lowest Mr. Sundries, who accumulated only six.
At the second attempt the High School vanished foi-
ls?, and Auckland grabbed the trophy it was after
and departed with an innings and 194 runs going to
seed.

Not only do our girls play practically all
the field games nowadays, but they are distinguish-
ing themselves therein more and more —-at swimming,
surfing, shooting at the butts or along the swamps,
football, track-running, motoring, fencing, boxing,
jiu-jitsu, even horse-racing, for a small girl landed
a race in Queensland the other day aboard her
father’s prad. At cricket the girls grow more apt
every dav. One of them, named Elsie Vickerman,
playing for the Auckland (MX.) Girls’ Grammar
School, smote 101 not out in a game against the
Diocesan Girls’ High School. She did it against
fairly good bowling, too, and was presented with a
cricket bat to mark the performance.

Is it the exercise or the good-fellowship
of bowls that keeps young fellows like J. Barrie
so fresh and well ? He is the holder of the
North Coast (N.S.W.) veterans’ championship, puts
his age down at 83, and still keeps up the war on
“Kittv.” Last week he was with a Northern team
in S'dnev plaving as “leader.” ,

How these Australians hang it out. Ben
Thoroughgood, champion heavy-boat puller, has a
sister named Mrs. Latham. At the recent Hunter
River (N.S.W.) Professional Sculling Club’s regatta
she bundled a son into a skiff and with some assist-
ance from him won the mixed double sculls after a
hard tussle. Of course, she is only 57 years young
and has been mother to 13 children, but it wasn’t
bad.

Sandy Bay had all the limelight at the
61st New- Norfolk (Tas.) regatta by winning the four
principal rowing events and filling; second and third
positions in others. The performance set up a
record in the Flyspeck ; and now the Speck is won-
dering whether it’s to Sandy Bay's credit or its
discredit.
* * * *
For the first time in 6o years the Huon
(Tas.) Regatta, which is usually a very wet affair,
ran dry this year. The regatta committee had
already sold the booth rights and earmarked the
proceeds for the war funds when the local Licensing
Bench decided that it must follow the King, and the
cash had to be refunded.

Coincidences in the year's sport got a
good start at Sydney on Saturday. The Eastern
Suburbs’ Ladies’ Club decided three events —:50yds.
handicap, 100yds. handicap, and diving. The result
in each event was: Miss Fanny Durack, 1; Mrs. W.
Terry, 2 ; Miss V. Combe, 3. .
* * * •
D. H. Devine, of Victoria, who is the
speediest professional athlete in Australia nowadays,
lias been laboring against bad luck. At Flemington
he cut out 974yds. in 9 3-ssec., and at Maryborough
flew over 1194yds. in 11 4-ssec., both efforts being
under even time. But neither dash was fast enough
to take the first prize. 11. Carroll, Footscrav, took
the bulk of the gilt of the series of meetings, by
arriving home first in the Maryborough Handicap
( £5O), first in the 220yds. and second in the big
event at Eehuca.

A new pole vault record for Maoriland
went on the slate when G. Harvey, at Masterton, on
Boxing Day. hoisted himself over lift. 3in. This
betters by one inch the previous best, which stood
to the credit of the Yankee hurdler Templeton, who
vaulted over lift. 2in. on the same ground two
seasons back. This is the first of the records made
by the invading Yankee team at that time to go
overboard. Two others made on the ground on the
date of the pole record are likely to stand for many
a day. They are Power's mile in 4min. 18 2-ssec.
and Parker’s 440yds. in 49sec.

Bulgaria isn't thinking of war all the

Clarke Maeonochie, the Maoriland billiards
champion, is said to be rivalling Gray as a player of
losing hazards from baulk. Mac. is credited with
a recent break of 1000 off the red ball. Meanwhile
Fred Landrum, the Australian champion, who is
pretty deadly with the “Gray stroke” when he
brings it into action, seems to be content to
develop his all-round game. Lindrum, by the way,
who is now in charge at Phil Stuart's, has been
negotiating with George Gray and Newman, the
Englishman, for a visit to Australia next season.

Motor-cars and cycles are the deadliest
vehicles in Sydney. They accounted for 23 deaths
during 1915. ' Other vehicles settled 23 citizens; the
trams, which a year or so ago were res-onsible for
an evening paper running a special “Red Roll,
slaughtered 20; and eight died as the result of train
accidents.
FOWLER v. CHINN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“You would hardly call it a fight,” said Mr.
Fowler when interviewed yesterday. “When I met
him I was carrying a handbag and umbrella. He
Struck at me with a cane, but I managed to get in a
good hard kick.” — Age.
When Brother Chinn met Fowler in the street,
And spoke to that redoubtable M.P.,
He called him names too nasty to repeat,
But Fowler did not turn away and flee ;
No, roaring like a lion in his wrath
When Chinn became offensive with a stick,
He tried to shift the foeman from his path
By getting in a Good Hard Kick.
The form of Fowler bore the brand of cane;
His nose and mouth were marked by Brother
Chinn,
Who walked away complaining of a pain
In buttock, kneecap, or, it may be, shin ;
Chinn claimed to be the winner of the war,
But ’twist them there was nothing much to pick,
For Fowler made a portion of him sore
By getting in a Good Hard Kick.
Some blokes believe in putting up their hands
If anyone assaults them in the street,
But very often strategy demands
An unexpected putting up of feet.
If you’re carrying a brolly and a bag,
And a rock from off the road you cannot pick,
You had better save the honor of the Flag
By getting in a Good Hard Kick.
VICTORIA.

To those who are troubled with sore, tender,
aching, swollen, perspiring, unpleasant smelling
feet, bunions, corns or hard skin, “BIFF” will
bring quick relief and gladness to the feet. Use
BIFF today and banish all pain and discomfit.
By using BIFF” once a week you will insure
your feet against all foot troubles. “BIFF”’ is a
scientific compound which draws out all poisonous
matter from the feet, which clog and choke pores
of the skin. One application of this unique com-
pound will render the feet sweet and antiseptic.
Its delightful results must be experienced to be
believed.
MRS. CARTER WRITES :—F'or years my feet
gave me much trouble. It was purgatory to
have to walk far, but after using one box of
Biff” I can walk with perfect ease and com-
fort, there is nothing to compare with your
tt preparation for foot trouble.”
“Biff” can be obtained through all chemists and
stores ; if not in stock send direct to the manu-
facturers. Price Is. 6d. per box, or triple size box
4s. (triple box contains three times the Is.6d. size).

Have You a BAD LEG
perhaps surrounded with inflammation and
swollen, that when you press your finger on
the inflamed part it leaves the impression?
It' so, under the skin you have poison, which
defies the remedies you have tried. Perhaps
your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round
which the skin may be discolored. The disease,
it' allowed to continue, will deprive you of
the power to walk. You may have attended
hospitals and been told your case is hopeless,
or advised to submit to amputation, but do
riot. Try the great British Remedy:—•

soft, artistic polish so appropriate to the style. It entirely removes the
“cloudiness” from mahogany furniture, restoring its original gloss.
Keep your dining-room table bright and tempting—it will give an added charm
to your home. Hot dishes have no effect on tables polished with Johnson’s
Prepared Wax. It never becomes sticky or tacky in the hottest weather, or
from the heat of the body, consequently does not gather dust or show linger
prints.
Every family has dozens of uses for Johnson’s Prepared Wax. It is just as
necessary ’round the house as soap. Keep a tin always on hand to clean and
polish your
Floors
Linoleum
Woodwork

So the year’s 7 p.c. dividend calls for less
than half of the profit. The question is : Are
there risks to be provided for? What are
they? Two, chiefly. First, the misapplica-
tion of trust funds. One or two offices have
suffered in that way through misreading their
instructions, but there has been no case-in
the courts for nearly 20 years. A trustee
has a great advantage in his business over
most people in theirs. If you want to know
whether you can shoot a man’s bull it is no
use going to a Judge and asking him. You
must do the doubtful thing first and suffer
afterwards if you are wrong. But when a
trustee is in doubt about the interpretation
of a will he can go to the court for directions,
and the estate pays the cost. Add this safe-
guard to the special training of a co.’s officers,
and it will be seen that, for practical pur-
poses, there really isn’t much in this risk.
Next, the co. has the small risk of safely in-
vesting its own funds. Of course, it takes no
risk as to the trust investments. It guaran-
tees neither principal nor interest —always
excepting the Maoriland State Office, which
on certain terms will guarantee both. The
chances are that this will be the next big
concession made by trustee offices —this
guaranteeing of principal and interest. It
will be no use saying it can’t be done. It is
done, and that on a very big scale, by life-
insurance offices, which as the trustees of
premiums undertake to pay the principal
plus interest when one of two or three things
happens. -For the present, however, the ten-
dency of the trustee office is to make con-
cessions in charges rather than in new privi-
leges. This paper would rather see the move-
ment the other way. A policy of “cheap and
nasty” in this line of business would be most
disastrous. The thing to be aimed at rather
is more security for beneficiaries.
As already suggested, competition is going
to pull down the rates or add to the privi-
leges of clients ; and most.of the offices are
getting into a position where they can well
afford it. See what changes there have been
here :—-
1910. 1914. 1915.
Liabilities .. .. .. £5,075 £64 £B7
Assets :
Government securities . . 10,000 10,000 10,000
Mortgages, etc 10,111 11,202 10,301
Sundries 9,906 10,766 13,841
Freeholds.. i. . . 13,950 13,950 13,950
Note how in five years the liabilities have
been paid off, while sundry assets (mostly
semi-liquid) have been piled up. And that
is on a small capital of £30,000, and after
paying dividend. These cos. have been on a
very fine wicket. And they haven’t finished
their innings yet by a long way. There is
three times the work available that they have
yet secured; and the advantages they offer-
over their non-professional competitors must
gradually win the business for them.

Not a single Bendigo mine paid five figures
in dividends during 1915. Carlisle did best
in the production of gold, getting 61140 z.
from 23,039 loads, but came only second on
the dividend list with 4s. per share, the first
position being taken by Victoria Consols
with 3SSSoz. won from 12,307 tons, and divs.
ss. per share. Nearly all the other contribu-
tors out of profits were old stagers like
Koch’s Pioneer, New Moon, Clarence and
Great Northern. All these are relying on
the leavings of the old days near the sur-
face, so that the hard-up look of the field
isn’t likely to disappear during 1916. A
decade ago the gold yield was 218,0000 z.,
divs. £230,000, and calls £175,000, a neat
balance being available to the investor. Now
the yield is down to 119,6620 z., dividends are
£62,587, and calls £49,245.
* * * *
The following are a few figures in rela-
tion to four small N.S.W. gold-mining pro-
positions in which the public has been
recently induced to put money: (1) Expen-
diture £BOO. gold won £5O; (2) expenditure
£l6OO, gold won £4O; (3) expenditure
£lOOO, gold won practically nil; (4) expen-
diture £3OOO, gold won under £3OO. Yet
people lament the difficulty of obtaining
capital to develop ventures. If only the
public could be induced to put good coin
into all the shows that “only want a little
capital” to dazzle the world, the industry
would cost about as much as the war.
Mining is a good national asset still, but it
is in the hands of a crowd which strongly
resembles an alligator with a large appetite
and no conscience. The public’s only hope,
in connection with new ventures, is to touch
nothing which a trained, judicially-minded
mine-appraiser does not recommend. And
such men are precious few.
From one of the old crowd
Cock’s Pioneer, Eldorado (Vic.), when working
with a ramshackle plant in 1907 under Jack Dane’s
management dealt with about 340,000 cubic yards
at a working cost of under sid. per cub. yard, accord-
ing to Government returns for that year. Under
the present management, after spending £50,000 on
up-to-date plant, the co. is crowing because it has
reduced its working costs from Bd. to 7d. per yard.
For some months boring operations have been carried
on at the mine, but the only information vouchsafed
to the shareholders is that So-and-So bore has been
put down to a depth of so-and-so ; information as to
results is reserved seemingly for the benefit of those
in the know. This valueless news is even cabled to
the London office, and the London directors of the
co. can only guess what has happened from Melbourne
market fluctuations.

Died in London, aged 70. Frederick Rogers,
the man who more than any other won old-
age pensions for England. The son of a
dock-laborer, Rogers was carrying a sand-
wich-board in London gutters at 13, and
earned a precarious crust in various other
ways till a lucky chance got him into the
vellum-binding trade. Always interested in
social and political matters, he came to the
front as long ago as IS7O. and became the
first chairman of the Labor Representative
Committee, later known as the Labor party.
As organising secretary of the National Com-
mittee of Organised Labor he pegged away
steadily at his pension scheme for years till
he achieved his purpose in the Old Age Pen-
sion Act of .IQOS. Early in life Rogers came
across Canon Barnett of Toynbee Hall —a
“university settlement” in East London with
the object of bringing the universities into
touch with the-Fife of the people—and his
inborn love of literature developed phenom-
enally. He threw himself into the univer-
sity-extension movement, and with Alfred
Milner (now a peer) founded the Eliza-
bethan Society, and himself became one of
the best authorities on the literature aud
drama of that period. A nephew of Bar-
nett's—Percy F. Rowland, now headmaster
of Townsville (Q.) Grammar School —tried
some 20 years ago to start a Toynbee Guild
to do similar work in connection with Syd-
ney Uni., and Rogers interested himself in
the scheme, but local support flagged and the
experiment failed. From ISSO onwards
Rogers had not worked at his trade, but had
given all his time to social and political
questions, keeping himself meanwhile by
journalism and lecturing.
Nowadays poor old ex-Victorian Governor
Brassey is paying the price of his incurable
habit of falling off things. In a speech at
a recent patriotic gathering . fie. explained
his “lame and halting appearance” by refer-
ence to his tumble into Hobson's Bay years
ago. "It was feared that I had-'broken tey
pelvis,” he said, “but although that was riot
really so. I fear I must have broken some
small bone, and the ultimate consequence has
been that lam crippled. One leg is a very
lame leg. and, as you see. I can hardly drag
myself about. Dr. Shields says I must
grin and bear its and. as you can see. too.
I am grinning and bearing it.”

IDEA
** Y(
Showing the little lever device
for easy filing. When closed it
lies flush with the surface of the
barrel.
This new type of the
Fountain Pen which
popularised handwriting,
is the outcome of much
thought, much - experi-
ment, and vast expense
in machinery and labour,
all of which have been
amply justified by the
remarkable demand that
followed its introduction.
Many thousands of this
new type of Waterman’s
Ideal have been purchased
already. Why ? Firstly,
because there was a
distinct need for a simple,
efficient, and trustworthy
Self-Filling Fountain Pen ;
and, secondly, because the
new pen was a Waterman’s
Ideal, and, therefore, could
be relied upon implicitly.
The only difference be-
tween the Regular Water-
man’s Ideal and the New
Type is the addition of the
simple self-filling device
and a screw cap. In all
other respects the pens are
identical. Ask your sta-
tioner to show you this
splendid new self-filling
pen.
Waterman's Ideal is made in three types
“-the New Lever Pocket Self-filler, the
Regular and the Safety. Every Pen
guaranteed.
For ACTIVE SERVICE and Outdoor
use, we recommend the “Safety”
type, which can be carried in any
position and will not leak.

SYDNEY. !
IN BANANA LAND
Dr. Frodsliam, who till lately bislied in
the North, but now reposes in a snug canonry
of Gloucester Cathedral, announces a new
book, “A Bishop’s Pleasaunce,” mostly his
N.Q. observations already turned to profit
in the shape of magazine articles. Frodsham
really did have bush experiences to write
about. He would certainly have collared the
prize if the Easter Show committee had
offered one for driving four-in-hands open to
bishops only.
In spite of the House of Fat’s efforts, the
recent Parliamentary session was a record.
In all 47 Bills were dealt with, although
only 25 were outlined in the Governor's
speech. Of the 35 Bills passed. 10 were
amendments. The others included the Elec-
tions Bill (postal vote abolished, provision
for the use of a joint State and Common-
wealth roll, compulsory voting, signed
articles), Land Tax Bill. Petroleum Bill,
Workers’ Compensation Bill (State insur-
ance scheme) and the Railways Act Amend-
ment Bill (guarantee system abolished). The
Commonwealth Powers Bill, the I meal
Authorities Amendment Act (adult suffrage
in municipal affairs) and the Council
Abolition Bill were all rejected by
the Landlords. Five Bills were lost,
and if again lost next session will
go to a referendum. They include the
Meatworks Bill (power to take over all meat-
works) and an Industrial Arbitration Bill to
amend the Industrial Peace Act.
“Itan” : Re the Melbourne Age’s sugges-
tion to harness black and colored labor to
the Northern Territory, it is significant that
no one in the sugar industry in Queensland
ever seriously suggests the return of
Tommy Tanna. The Tory farmers, the
Tory politicians, and the Tory other people
are quite convinced that the industry was
never so well equipped as it is now. If
one wants to get a hornet’s nest around his
ears let him go into any of the sugar dis-
tricts and preach a return to the days of
black and yellow. Eveu those who fought
against the repatriation of the 8000 kanakas
admit that things have turned out right. It
isn't the climate the Territory suffers from ;
it is the isolation. Give men the knowledge
that they can get home by a train within a
reasonable time if they want to, and they
will move out and chance things.
The Brisbane Y.M.C.A. people have just
set a fine example by surrendering their
palatial quarters to the use of wounded
soldiers. Each member continues to pay
his sub. as heretofore, but gives up his share
in the snuggery.
“P.F.”: There is a mistaken impres-
sion abroad that the Wide Bay election
didn’t signify much, as one side was neglect-
ful and the other didn’t worry. But
the Electoral Officer’s figures show precisely
the opposite: 28,216 persons out of 34,2 1 6
recorded their votes, or nearly 83 per cent., as
against nearly 84 per cent, at the general elec-
tion. The per centage was truly phenomenal
for a by-election, and indicates clearly that
some very powerful agency was at work
driving the usually inert country voter to
the poll. There can be no denying that the
Ryan Government’s policy is distinctly in
favor of the town worker, who is a Labor
supporter, and just as distinctly unjust to
the country producer. Witness the butter
question, the sudden dropping of the price of
milk and the equally sudden reversal of the
drop, and the raising of railway fares and
freights against the farmer while city and
suburban rates remained unaltered. And,
as Ryan himself remarked, the battle was
fought out on State issues.
KEEPING IT UN DEFILED.
ETHEL: "O Auntie, I think I could improve the poise of that feather —let me. will you?"
AUNTIE ( newly-arrived): “ No Australian taste in my millinery, if you please."
Just passed out at Millbank. near Bunda-
berg, old Tom Penny, the most notable of
the surviving pioneers of the Queensland
sugar industry. Penny's connection with
the business goes right back to the sixties;
he saw the rise and fall of the industry in
the Mary district, and pioneered it in com-
pany with the Busses on the lower Burdett.
Genial and generous to a fault, “Old Tom”
fought the cursed climate for 76 solid years
and then departed cheerily.
“F. 8.”. Queensland claims the invention
of the deep-sea net that allegedly runs from
Dover to Calais. But Bananaland was a
mighty inventor long ago. Nearly 60 years
back the sheep on Barambah station con-
tracted contagious catarrh and had to be
boiled down for tallow. The cost of bring-
ing casks from Maryborough to Barambah
was, however, so great that it looked as 'f
the fat would have to be wasted. But
Barambah had brains as well as catarrh and
discovered that a sheep's paunch could be
turned inside out. provided with a small slit,
filled through a funnel with tallow, tied up
and sent per waggon to port. That little
idea was worth a lot to Barambah then and
a lot more to other people since.
A Far Northerner, sending the usual
“Good luck!” for Christmas, mentions a
mate he’s camped with :
An old chap named Mick Kirby, who was on the
first Palmer rush, and that’s over 30 years ago,
has been gouging out rich surface ore and sending it
to Chillagoe smelters. The old battler is /0, has
one eye and a “gammy” leg, but he hauls up the
ore over 100 ft. single-handed. I’m pretty tough,
but the vitality of some of the battlers in this
Northern climate makes me gasp.
“Politicals”: It used to be the fashion
among Laborites to decry Bob Philp on
account of his deficits, which, after all, weie
mainly due to a terrific slump in railway
revenue caused by drought conditions.
Queensland's Labor Government has just
published its half-yearly financial returns,
which show a deficit of £119,000 —the first
for 11 years—in spite of the fact that the
six months’ revenue is the biggest on record,
and that there has been no slump in railway
returns at all, but an actual increase. The
only things that have slumped are common-
sense, restraint, management and grit. And
the dreadful shortage has been achieved
despite the outpouring of Trust and Loan
Funds at the rate of over five millions per
annum —for a country of only 6b0,000 per-
sons ! Even Holman, of N. S. Wales, doesn’t
quite equal that insanity.
Very little is being done in Bananalaud to
provide for Billjim when he hobbles back
from the trenches. There is a War Council,
it is true, but. though sub-committees have
been appointed; the members are mostly sit-
ting on the sliprails thinking. There is no
trouble about moving the hat round for a
wristlet watch or a few’ dozen of beer when
Bill goes off, and it seems about time there
was as much enthusiasm over the other job.
Rockhampton City Council, which runs
its own tram service, has been staring at a
bill of costs with fury in its eye. Two years
ago there was a bad accident on the lines:
but all its luck wasn’t out. for 29 claims
for damages out of 30 were cleared up for
£7SO. The thirtieth claimant was refractory,
and rather than go to law the Council paid
£4OO. It was just congratulating itself that
it had settled the lot —including three
deaths —at a fraction under £4O a head,
when the lawyer for one of the claimants
sent in his bill. It was for £l3O. The
Council asked it to be officially taxed. Ten
months later it came back from the taxing
office swollen to £217. Preparatory to fork-
ing out. the City Grandfathers are engaged
in fervent prayer for somebodv's everlasting
soul. ‘ 0
“Every Man and Every Shilling.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Every man and every shilling!
Drop your cooing, drop your billing!
Man, is this a time to tarry
With your mind on “Woo and Marry,”
When your girl has got a brother
Choking in the deadly smother
Of the falling, caving trenches,
Far from home and love and wenches?
Do you know the human curtain
That is shielding you for certain
Is composed of boys who perish
For the sake of them they cherish.
While i/oit never lift a finger,
While you dawdle and you linger
Like a dabbler in a hothouse
At the picture-show and pothouse?
Drop your tippling, toying, billing—
Every man and every shilling!
Every man and every shilling!
Don’t you feel a pulse go thrilling
Through your blood until you shiver
Like a tidal-changing river
With the thought that leaves you
breathless —
“Liberty alone is deathless!”
Close behind us shuts the portal,
She is, like our land, immortal;
She can weave a shining garland
For our children ; make a star-land
Of the vales that seem the poorest,
Of the braes that seem the dourest;
She is noblest, she is nearest.
She is worth our blood the dearest.
Don’t you feel a pulse go thrilling?
Every man and every shilling!
QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, January 8, 1916
My Dear Thabgomindaii,—
The little blind god has been kept busy this
more or less festive season. One of the
newest brides-to-be is Dorothy Earwaker.
Her partner is “Billy” Longwill, who is
somewhere on one *of the tracks that lead
to glory. Something similar has befallen
Pearl Winter, of Hendon, Roma, and one
Reginald Drysdale, only son of the late T.
G Drysdale, of Roma ; while Eva Armstrong,
of Milton, and Walter Cecil Thompson, who
hails from England, have also an understand-
ing. But the surprise of the week is the
announcement of the engagement of Kenneth
Dalzell, only son of the popular Dalzells, of
Dalgai station, to Grace Morgan, one of
Brisbane s prettiest daughters and elder chick
of Mr. and Mrs. E. Morgan, of Toowong.
Edna Iveid will sport the plain gold band
next week. Her mate will be Leslie Trout,
fourth son of Richard Trout, M.L.A. Lieut.
Leslie shortly departs for the battle lines.
The Girls’ Club, which gave the boys in
camn a spree at Christmas time, managed
everything so well that there are still enough
shots in the locker to give the lads another
picnic at Easter. In addition, a substantial
contribution has been made towards the pro-
posed stadium and hall at Enoggera.
Another pressman to forsake the pen for
the sword is Arthur Foote, of the Daily
Standard. He wears one star already.
Dr. E. S. Jackson, who left Queensland a
little over a year ago with the A.A.M.C., and
has been seriously ill in England, returned
by the Osterley yesterday. Mrs. Jackson
came with him.
Mr. J. A. Robertson and daughter Mar-
jorie, who have been visiting U.$.A., have
moved on to London. They will wait there
for son and brother Noel, who is hurrying
thitherwards to enlist with strangers instead
of with the men of his own nation.
Dr. and Mrs. Cuppaidge and their two
daughters came down from Gympie this week
to bid goodbye and good luck to young Loftus.
who, with his rifle on his shoulder (and
there’s no man could be bolder), is off to
Philadelphia or somewhere in the morning.
Recently a gallant lad in khaki pulled up
a bolting horse and retired laden with blushes
and the thanks of the damsel who was hang-
ing on to the ribbons. Next day the girl
visited the camp and pointed the hero out to
the Commandant, who handed him three
days’ C.B. for being absent without leave.
Anyhow, that’s the picturesque yarn that’s
going the rounds. It originated probably
with the worker who was blown skywards
while blasting rock, and w T hose boss docked
the time he spent aeroplaning.
Arthur Riscoe, the light comedian with
Branscombe’s local Dandies, has enlisted.
D. J. Abercrombie, who has been with the
Commercial Bank of Sydney for 52 years, has
retired. He was manager of the Brisbane
office, and after the day’s work took a keen
interest in the welfare of sporting bodies,
especially bowling and sailing clubs.
The Woman’s Mutual Club, which went
into recess at Christmas, has re-opened.
Mail day is the best time to see the value
which soldiers’ wives place upon its facilities
for swapping news from their men at the
front. They crowd the place.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Oliver Cromwell Roberts, the Yankee
chemist who is campaigning against Aus-
tralia's • greatest vegetable enemy, has not
yet given up hope. He has now designed an
apparatus in the shape of a battering-ram,
which is to slay the brigalow scrub amongst
which the pear revels. The timber-slaying
will take place after the pear has withered
up from chlorine asphyxiation, thus securing
the maximum amount of potash after the
tire has been given a chance. This batter-
mg-ram gear can use arguments weighing
15 tons, and most brigalow will show the
white feather long before that.
It needs more than ordinary luck to get a
grazing homestead at the ballot, but unless
one Simpson, a commission agent, is some-
thing out of the common he has collided with
the dead limit. Simpson told Commissioner
Ividston. at Roma, on oath, that he was
handling various applications for a certain
block when the Crown Lands ranger, who
was running the ballot, said to him : “There
is no use your putting any applications in.
1 am running the Court, and Ilenning will
get the block.” And, later, after Henning
had got the block : "I faked both ballots. The
accepted envelope was never in the box.” Of
course, the C.L. ranger swears that Simp-
son was a liar, and that the ballot was a
square go. Ividston, however, thought the
evidence quite sufficient to justify him in
cancelling the ballot, and advised a full in-
quiry into the business—or whatever it was.

SELECTED RECIPES FROM HERE AND T HERE. THINGS EVERY WOMAN WANTS
TO KNOW'.
The Magnetism of Beautiful
Hair.
“Applied Arts.”
Beautiful bair adds immensely to the per-
sonal magnetism of both men and women.
Actresses and smart women are ever on the
lookout for any harmless thing that will
increase the natural beauty of their hair.
The latest method is to use pure .stallax as a
shampoo, on account of the peculiarly glossy,
fluffy and wavy effect which it leaves. As
stallax has never been used much for this
purpose it comes to the chemist only in Jib.
sealed original packages, enough for twenty -
five or thirty shampoos. A teaspoonful of the
fragrant stallax granules, dissolved in a cup
of hot water, is more than sufficient for each
shampoo. It is very beneficial and stimulat-
ing to the hair, apart from its beautifying
effect.
Permanently Removing
Superfluous Hair.
“Toilet Gossip.”
How to permanently, not merely tempo-
rarily. remove a downy growth of disfiguring
superfluous hair, is what many women wish
to know. It is a pity that it is not more
generally known that pure powdered pheminol.
obtainable from the chemists, may be used
for this purpose. It is applied directly to
the objectionable hair. The recommended
treatment not only instantly removes the
hair, leaving no trace, but is designed also to
kill the roots completely.
Don’t Have Grey Hair.
A simple, old-fashioned, home-made recipe will make
the greyness disappear.
Grey hair is often a serious handicap to
both men and women while still in the prime
of life. Hair dyes are not advisable because
they are always obvious, inconvenient and
often downright injurious. Few people know
that a very simple formula, which is easily
made up at home, will turn the hair back to a
natural color in a perfectly harmless manner.
You have only to get an ounce of tammalite
concentrate from your chemist and mix it
with four ounces of bay rum to prove this
Apply this simple and harmless lotion for a
few nights to the hair with a small sponge and
the greyness will gradually disappear. The
lotion is neither sticky nor greasy, and has
been proved over and over again for genera-
tions past by those in possession of the for-
mula.
To Have Smooth, White
Skin, Free from Blemish.
“Boudoir Gossip.”
Does your skin chap or roughen easily, or
become unduly red or blotchy V Let me tell
you a quick and easy way to overcome the
trouble and keep your complexion beautifully
white, smooth and soft. Just get some
ordinary mercolised wax at the chemist’s and
use a little before retiring as you would use
cold cream. The wax, through some peculiar
action, flecks off the rough, discolored or
blemished skin. The worn-out cuticle comes
off just like dandruff on a diseased scalp, onlv
in almost invisible particles. Mercolised wax
simply hastens Nature’s work, which is the
rational and proper way to attain a perfect
complexion, so much sought after, but very
seldom seen. The process is perfectly simple
and quite harmless.
Blackheads Fly Away.
Instantaneous remedy for blackheads, greasy skin
and large pores.
A practically instantaneous remedy for
blackheads, greasy skins and enlarged pores,
recently discovered, is now coming into
general use in the boudoir. It is very simple,
harmless and pleasant. Drop a stymol tablet,
obtained at the chemist’s, in a tumbler full
of hot water. After the effervescence has
subsided bathe the face in the liquid, using a
small sponge or soft cloth. In a few minutes
dry the face and the offensive blackheads will
come right off on the towel. Also the large
oily pores immediately close up and efface
themselves naturally. The greasiness dis-
appears and the skin is left smooth, soft and
cool. This simple treatment is then repeated
a few times at intervals of four or five days to
ensure the permanence of the result. ft

“Stalls”: lie was from the back row of
the bush ; but some of the papers that print
illustrated patent-medicine ads. occasionally
reached him, so when he came to town he
found he wasn't entirely unacquainted with
the leading stage-folk. When the Queen of
the Tango Tarts whirled on, he hailed her
joyfully. “Blimey! that’s the Stagger Oint-
ment tart! Done her good it has!” He
was still gloating over the Queen’s repaired
complexion when a pretty little dancer
flashed into view. “There’s Bunstruck’s
Tonic!” he cried; “she couldn’t sleep at
night until she got a bottle of it!” After
that, ignoring the tenderly familiar names
on the programme, he picked out various
smiling beauties as “Limp’s Foot Balm,”
“Perjurer’s Hair Lunch” and "Gnasher’s
Art Dentistry Parlors.” To his impartial
eye they were only so many capering adver-
tisements.
“Kaniva”: “Pip” (B. 16/12/T5) is all at
sea. He says Geo. Titheradge, G. W.
Anson, Phil Beck and Pattie Brown were
together at the Theatre Royal, Sydney, in
1883, Pattie Brown a„d Anson providing
the low-comedy part in “Human Nature.”
As a matter of fact, the piece was staged
for the first time in Australia at the Mel-
bourne Royal in 1886, with the three actors
above mentioned in the cast. Anson played
in Sydney during 1885, and Phil Beck made
his first appearance in Sydney at the
Theatre Royal in 1886 in “The Crimes of
Paris.”
“Musketoon” : Harry Julius’s cartoons re-
garding the revolution against the peanut
(B. 12/12/T5) remind me of Kate Rooney’s
concerts at Forbes (N.S.W.) a few years
ago. Kate was singing “Out on the Rocks,”
and half-way through one verse she stopped.
The audience thought she had forgotten her
lines; it applauded so as to give her time
to collect herself. When the clapping had
died down she cried : “I can’t continue sing-
ing while peanuts are being eaten in the
front row.” Then the nut-cracking ceased
with a thud, and while tw r o young persons
were looking like boiled lobsters Kate burst
into song again. But, after all. it may not
have been the peanuts -which ruffled her back
hair. It may have been the echoes of the
crunching in the empty house.
“C. Ockney”: London being no place for
him, Bernard Shaw has gone back to his
native land. A new play of his is being
produced by the renowned Abbey Players in
dear, dirty Dublin. It is only a one-acter,
but none the worse for that, I’ll be bound.
Shaw’s best play, to my mind, is the one-
act “Showing up of Blanco Posnet.” The
baby’s name is “Michael O’Flaherty, V.C.,”
which is not a bad one to conjure wdth in the
country where the O’Flahertys come from
and this one goes to.
“Busker”: The Actors’ Association of Aus-
tralasia has decided to throw a somersault
and become a beastly union. The Associa-
tion, which started out in life as a bomb
aimed at the Actors’ Union, burst up that
promising show and then loudly and fre-
quently stated that its one darling object was
to help sick and needy mummers. Large
sums were extracted from the public by
various devices for this object, although there
w T ere already at least two organisations in
Australia working at the same job. Tire
Ass.’s business methods were weird, but
its offices were maintained in splendid
style. Believing that the affair stood
for wffiat it said it did, a mummer once
wrote for a little financial help. He had
been taken suddenly ill in North Queensland,
where he was travelling with a small show,
and was left behind in hospital to undergo
a severe operation. The benevolent affair
promptly turned him down and said on very
ornate letter-paper: “You have neglected to
take advantage of membership and you must
blame yourself if wfflen misfortune comes the
rules prevent the council from going outside
their membership.” And so they passed by
on the other side.
“Glenhuntly”: The “Mother Goose” pan-
tomime, with about the weakest “book” on
record and a batch of imported comedians
apparently incapable of manufacturing their
own fun, makes the firm’s unwillingness to
employ a decent local writer to dress its
tripe look particularly absurd. Hidden on
the panto programme, in a forest of capital
letters, is a line in small type which whis-
pers : “Extra lyrics and topical matter by
Reginald Franklin.” Judged by the samples
in “Mother Goose,” “Reginald Franklin,”
whoever he is, has as much idea of perpe-
trating a bright “gag” or a topical reference
that is not utterly fatuous as a guinea-pig
has of dancing the tango. Two seafarers are
supposed to observe Parliament House in the
distance. One announces that there is a
bird on top of the building. “Oh. that’s a
Peacock,” replies the other brightly! The
only explanation of this sort of thing, when
experienced writers like Edward Dyson. C.
J. Dennis and others are available, is that
“Reginald Franklin” is as cheap as his (or
is it their?) “humor.”
When the last mail left N’Yark “Sher-
lock Holmes” was on the boards again, this
time at the Empire Theatre. Gillette was
again perpetrating the detective who never
smiled, and was doing it, so his yarn went,
because he couldn’t get a new play to suit.
A MISCONCEPTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
How sad he was! I grieved to see
The mournful eye he turned on me.
“Y’ twig that lighted tent?” he said.
I patted him upon the head.
“I do, my boy.” He tried to grin.
“Me and a cobber just sneaked in.
“We watched our charnce, and Bill and me
Bunked in the circus show to see.
But one bloke copped me ’neath the tent—
His boot has left a hawful dent.
Another cove got Billy’s ear,
And led him gently to the rear.
“We done a duck beneath a seat,
And got mixed up with ladies’ feet.
They kicked us crool; but ’ai d and fast
We nailed a bloomin’ bench at last....
And then we come right out. In there
They hold a Wusleen service, sir! ”

FULL PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT
POSSIBLE FOR EVERY WOMAN!
g
ANY WOMAN without full bust development lacks the
one essential that creates a perfect appearance. Lack
of proper bust development, hollow cheeks and “salt-
cellars” quickly take from a woman the bloom and
freshness of healthy womanhood. Misfortune may have
been your -lot in so far as natural development is con-
cerned, but science has found a way to correct your
deficiency. Even though you have never been full-
bosomed, and have been attenuated all your life, if you
suffer from no wasting disease your bosom can be fully
developed and your weight increased to normal....
There are, to-day, hundreds of women who were once
thin, flat-bosomed, hollow-cheeked, and generally scraggly
in appearance, and suffering the effects of anaemia and
defective digestion, who are now, for the first time in
their lives, healthy, full-bosomed and pink-cheeked, and
enjoying the full vigor of robust womanhood, as the
result of a few weeks under our wonderful
DR. FALLIERE’S FLESH-FOOD.
Flesh-Food is totally harmless in every respect. Its
efficacy is beyond question, apd its use is no demand
upon the subject’s time. Many cases have gained up to
six pounds a w*eek, and an increase in bust measurement
up to eight and ten inches is possible. Flesh-Food offers
relief and development to the thousands of chronically
thin women who have despaired of ever possessing a pre-
sentable figure. It is a nerve and tissue food-treatment that
adds weight and permanent development to attenuated
women. Guarantee given in every case accepted.
WHAT A WELL-KNOWN NURSE SAVS.
Manager, “Flesh-Food” Co. Gympie, Queenslancj.
Dear Sir, —As a nurse I was very interested in your
Flesh-Food treatment, and was greatly surprised at the
wonderful results in my case. When I first wrote to you
I was only skin and bone, and 1 have good cause to be
thankful that I wrote you for a free sample, for I feel
certain now that I am one of the very best advertisements
you could possibly have, as I am developed in every way
satisfactory to myself, and I have waited a good while to
prove if it was lasting in its effect, and I am now glad to
say that your splendid treatment has done all you claimed
it would, my weight and measurements being ample.
I am, your gratefully
MRS. E. WINGROVE.
JUST AS WE PROMISED.
Falliere “Flesh-Food” Co. Mt. Gambier, SA.
Dear Sirs, —I am very pleased to tell you of the delightful
results in my case with your splendid treatment. If you
could see me to-day, you would readily realise how much
cause I have to be more than satisfied with the results,
when comparing my appearance with what it was.
I have gained in weight, and my measurements have
increased just as you said they would do, and my health
has improved marvellously.
Many, many thanks for your kind care and attention, and
your splendid remedy, and you can depend upon me to
always recommend its use.
Yours very gratefully,
EL,DA PEARL UNGER.

DID ALL, YOU SAID IT WOULD.
Gidginbung,
The Manager, via Temora,
Dear Sir, —I will need no further treat-
ment, as it has done for me all you said it
would do. I have gained the necessary
weight, also bust measurements required,
and my health is wonderfully improved;
in fact, you would not take me for the
same person as I was before using your
remedy.—l am, yours sincerely,
MISS M. HAKTUNG.
MORE THAN SATISFIED.
The Manager. Keefton, N.Z.
Dear Sir, —Having been away, I have not
previously replied to your communication,
and am now glad to say that I do not
require any more “Flesh-Food,” as I am
more than satisfied with the result. You
really would not know me now if you had
seen me just before taking the treatment.
Thanking you for your kind services.
Yours truly, CAROLINE FANSELOW.

There are still remaining two or three
who came to S. Aus. in the Buffalo with
Hindmarsh. who “proclaimed” the province;
but thej - were too young then to remember
the ceremony, and are too old now to make
public speeches. So this year, for the first
time, the chief toast at the Commemoration
luncheon was responded to by other than a
Buffalo pioneer. The choice fell on Otta-
wa y, a mere chicken who came in 1838, and
an unusually fine speech he made.
Baron Montagu, one of the survivors from
the torpedoed I’ersia. is a remarkable repre-
sentative of the never-say-die brigade. His
story of his escape:—
The port side of the vessel was submerged in two
minutes. 1 was dragged down and blown up to the
surface of the sea. I climbed on to the bottom: of a
broken boat with 28 Lascars and three Europeans.
This number was reduced to 19 on Thursday night
and to 11 on Friday ; the others died from exposure
and injuries. Our broken boat capsized frequently.
Me were all the time washed by the waves, and
were almost exhausted. Our survival and rescue
were miraculous. We had been 32 hours in the
sea without water or food, except one biscuit found
in the boat.
The tough old baron must have been the
veteran of that lucky 11. lie is a grandson
of the sporting Duke of Buccleuch and
Queensberry. and has always been a goer.
At Oxford he was stroke oar of his college
crew, and 20 years ago he went to S’Africa
for the Times to report on the Matabele war.
“Monty” is a good bit of a practical engineer,
and when the automobile came along he took
up motoring as an expert and edited the
leading trade journal. He was going to
India to be Inspector of Motor Traction
when the Hun submarine so nearly closed his
account. '
At Wellington (M.L.) a day or two ago
Captain Hales, of the Union Co.’s tug Tera-
W'hiti, was handed a medal and diploma, the
gift of the Jap Emperor, for having rescued
four fishermen and a woman from the Inland
Sea of Nippon, in June, 1914. Hales was
in the thick of a typhoon there as chief offi-
cer of the liner Minerie when he came across
the brown persons clinging to a capsized
schooner. He succeeded in dragging them
to his own craft. They explained that there
was a woman imprisoned in the capsized
boat; so Hales climbed up the tempest wav-
ing an auger and a saw, and cut his way into
the floating dungeon. For this the Royal
Humane Society has already pinned the
Stanhope medal on him; now the Mikado
has come along with his little lot.
Apart from the uproar among the local
“Liberals” and the weepiness of Opposition-
leader Wade, the only solemn feature of the
Assembly by-election for Drummoyne (Syd-
ney) is the candidature of “William Begg
(Walter Bentley).” The ancient Scotch
actor is standing in the “interests of mili-
tary efficiency,” which looks a fairly impres-
sive interest to stand in, since the State
Assembly has no more to do with that mat-
ter than it has with the silting of the Suez
Canal. But this is only Bill’s way of put-
ting it that he is out after Bung’s scalp—
and Bung is after his. It is such a fine,
hairy scalp, too, that Walter Bentley never
has to hire a wig.
Weeks ago it was cabled that the British
and the Germans were racing for Baghdad.
Evidently the Germans arrived first, as
the following items have been cabled since:
Dec. 17 (Athens). —Yon Mackensen has arrived in
Constantinople to lead the German-Turkish attack on
Suez.
Dec. 20 (Rome). —The Austro-German advance on
Salonika ha? begun. Von Mackensen is in charge.
Dec. 24 (Berne).- —The Swiss frontier is closed. A
German concentration in Alsace is being made. Von
Mackensen is to commence a vigorous offensive on
the southern end of the Western front.
Dec. 28 (Bucharest). —A Russian offensive in
Bukovina is threatened. Von Mackensen has taken
charge of the operation.
Dec. .31 (Amsterdam). —Von Mackensen is com-
manding, the Austro-Germans in the Galician theatre.
Jan 4 < (Copenhagen).—Yon Mackensen has left for
the Dvinsk-Riga front, where a last attempt is to
be made tre break through.
Jan. 7 (London). —Von Mackensen is in Berlin.
Good internal evidence, you see, that Mae-
kensen arrived at Baghdad first and
promptly stole the famous fairy carpet.
Dr. Elkington, borrowed for the purpose
from the Commonwealth Government, has
been telling the Tasmanian State Govern-
ment how it can get away with the £3iX)
which Parliament has provided this year
for grappling with syphilis in all its forms.
He advises it, to establish dispensaries, open
without charge and without question to out-
patients, at Hobart and at Launceston, and
to arrange with the hospitals for treating in-
patients. Then a pamphlet is to be sent to
doctors and chemists, to be distributed
among such of their patients as need it.
Dr. Elkington also considered the Speck’s
ancient Contagious Diseases Act, which
gives certain powers for the detention and
treatment of females, but none at all for
doing anything with males even though
they be rotten with the disease. He advised
that the piece of blue-mould should be re-
placed by something fairer and more up-to-
date, on the lines of the Queensland Act.
The Ministry is thinking about it, but
will soon be too busy with a general elec-
tion to bother. Meanwhile, however, the dis-
pensaries are to be set going.
“Trot” : It looks as if even in the midst
of war the Church keeps an ear cocked for
something other than the Glad Tidings, and
has an eye to spare for the keyhole. Accord-
ing to a pamphlet lately issued from an Aus-
tralian centre of piety it appears that
Not a few among us seem to be ruled by a spirit
of self-indulgence. . . . We get a hint of it if we walk
across the parks at night.
But why walk across parks at night to get
a view of human flotsam sprawling at its
ease when it might be sprawling more uncom-
fortably in the sweltering, foetid slum from
which a God-fearing landlord draws extor-
tionate rent? The slime and the ooze must
meet somewhere, anyhow; and it might be
as well for the elect to make up their minds
whether their quarrel is really with the park
or with the hint they get there. Come along
with me. See them there—over-dressed,
over-fed, powdered, lolling in deck chairs —
group of half a dozen women, gossiping.
Come back in a couple or hours. Still there,
gossiping and drinking tea. Afternoon : More
gossip somewhere ; more tea. Evening : More
(or less) clothing, food, theatre, gossip.
They haven’t done a useful thing all day,
and don’t intend to do one to-morrow or
next year, or any other old time. But these
women of the rich and moderately rich don t
go out into parks to give hints, of greater
self-indulgence —because they don’t have to.
What are the churches saying about them /
At a recent meeting of the Victorian
Board of Health it was moved that syphilis
be made a notifiable disease. In opposing
the motion. Hr. Robertson, the chairman of
the Board, said that such a procedure would
“bring about divorces by the score. Pre-
sumably the quaint medico reck<ms that it
is best that affected husbands and wives
should go on living together and breeding
diseased and decadent children. That such
a state of affairs is allowed to exist probably
explains another fact mentioned by the doc-
tor. namely that "in fully 70 per cent, of
the affected ca.ses contagion has been
brought about through innocent causes. ”
There may be a difference of opinion, though,
a~ to the innocence. For instance, suppos-
ing a Board of Health chairman could pre-
vent this contagion and doesn’t what is the
extent of his guilt?
The death of Edward Holroyd leaves the
way open for the retirement from the Bench
of either C.J. Madden or Thomas a’Beckett,
or perhaps both. By Act of Parliament
£3500 is available annually for pensions for
Victorian Supreme Court judges, no single
pension being allowed to exceed £l5OO. Of
recent years £l5OO has gone to Williams,
who is living in England, and £l5OO to Hol-
royd, leaving only £5OO available, which
neither Madden nor a’Beckett was inclined
to accept. Both may now retire on £lOOO
each; but it is more likely that Madden
will stay on, and a’Beckett accept £l5OO.
a’Beckett is in his SOth year; Madden is 71
and almost as spry and very nearly as
loquacious as ever.
His Ex. Liverpool, Governor of Maori-
land, is a colonel in an English rifle regi :
ment, and whenever he visits the military
camps he wears his rifleman’s uniform,
which is a quaint-looking affair. Recently
the sentry at Trentham was hauled over
the coals for failing to call out the guard
when the Governor passed. “Governor!
What Governor?” the astonished soldier re-
peated. He was reminded of the time and
other details. “Good God!” he exclaimed,
“You mean the chap in the black thigh
boots, black belt and swagger cane—black
hand on his cap and red tabs on his collar.
810w t me, I thought that was the Salvation
Army chaplain !”
“ Jonz”: If there is one thing certain in
Maoriland it is that the demand for con-
scription is growing louder. There is also
a simultaneous shriek for “conscription of
wealth”; and, though this does not seem to
be getting much more emphatic, there is a
noticeable crescendo to the demand for stiffer
treatment of war profits. The Lyttelton
Times (Christchurch), after protesting
alone against the country’s shameless sponge
on John Bull, has now got a chorus of news-
papers with it struggling to induce the
Irrational Government to do something sane
on the financial side, and most of the people
are decent enough to say “Hear, hear.”
. Liberalism has fussily decided to let the
dead past bury its Katz. “The political
opponents of Labor,” declares the Abgus,
with condescending magnanimity, “have no
wish to make party capital out of the Katz
incident. They are willing to consider it a
purely local and almost accidental exhibition
of rancor.” So like the old “Liberal” lady to
drag the episode out of limbo several weeks
after its occurrence, and “forgive” the Labor
party in public for something which it never
did.'
The advocacy of the wet canteen has given
Henry Worrall, the milk-white Methodist,
a new opportunity to do something for the
cause of intemperance. Parson Worrall is
the one Melbourne platformist who nowa-
days stands for all that is flamboyant and
wildly-whirling and self-advertising in the
pursuit of .Sin in Victoria; and his advo-
cacy of any cause is seldom marked by
applause from his fellow-churchmen, even
those of his own denomination. But he
keeps on buzzing down the track, with Sin
usually three laps ahead. “Liquor consumed
in the wet canteen,” declared the fatuous
Henry in a recent outburst, “will but sharp-
en the edge of an appetite that will seek
deeper gratification beyond the limits of
military encampments.” Henry completely
loses sight of the fact that the dry canteen
has meant the wet piggery, and that, in
cities like Melbourne, the early closing of
hotels sidetracks the soldier into the blind
pigsty. When Worrall ism shuts up the wet
canteen and the pub, ami leaves the blind
piggery open, it does something for intem-
perance which the wet canteen would never
do —and the fact is obvious to most intelli-
gent people of all parties and creeds.
“Machete”: The Hindu Babu has long
been famous as a polite letter-writer, but the
down-trodden Egyptian has also a place in
the sun. Here’s a sample of his skill that
was addressed to the Assistant Provost-
Marshal :
Sir, —I shall be exceedingly obliged if you will be
good enough as grant me a PASS for the purpose of
collecting the washing of the soldiers in the New
Aerodrome Camp. I am quite sure of your kindest
that you would not reject a poor Widow empty,
therefore be merciful upon me and the ALMIGHTY
WILL REWARD YOU FOR YOUR MERCY IN THE
EVER LASTING LIFE. I have the honour to be,
your obedient servant, Kalbi.
The Australian officer’s minute on the appli-
cation, by the way. was beautifully Aus-
tralian. Just: “Give the old girl what she
wants.”
E. J. Woods, dead in Adelaide at 76, was
as near as that city has come to owning
a great architect. Perhaps he had hardly
enough imagination to be great; on the other
hand set the difficulty of doing anything
striking in a city that is dead flat in sur-
face. Adelaide is full, anyhow, of his monu-
ments ; for he had the good luck to be Gov-
ernment Architect at a time when buildings
were going up that will not for many years
be repeated—Town Hall. Parliament House.
Anglican Cathedral. G.P.0., Governor’s
residence at Marble Hill, and Public
Library.

THERE is something most satisfactory about
having on the right shoes for the occa-
sion in hand. One feels comfortable,
smart, confident. And for any and every
occasion nothing could be more suitable or more
charming than patent leather, which always
looks well and goes so beautifully with every
colour and every fabric. Indeed, this little
shoe here illustrated will add no small share
of smartness and tone to one’s spring suit or
summer gown. And it is only one style of
many equally desirable, equally charming. For
Bostock shoes, besides being the last word in
smartness, all have a certain individuality which
sets them apart amongst ready-made shoes,
gives them the personal quality and the dis-
tinctive tone of shoes made specially to measure.

The Inky Way.
“Quill”: Fine writing a lost art? No
fear ! Look at this: —
Overhead are the passionless stars, and as you
watch the men working by the light of half a dozen
acetylene lamps, and look up to where the Southern
Cross swings low, and the Milky Way spreads its
eerie gauze of suns and worlds over a dark speck of
our world, you wonder what it all means. Here the
men, and the steamer, and the dark, restless sea,
and there is the bright planet Jupiter almost touch-
ing our masthead as the ship swings, and there are
the sailors from the North Sea cleaning the fish for
Sydney breakfast tables, and over us is the shadow
of life and labor, and trade-unionism, and the war.
Oh, the mystery of it all!
lie was telling one of the Sydney dailies
about a trip in a State trawler (p.n.), and
the crew had fallen upon a catch of fish to
remove its guts. And as the gouts of blood and
entrails were heaved over the side someone
roared out to be told where the ’ell the cook
had hidden the coffee.

went when he started to do his bit for his

“E.T.” : Truth is stranger than caricatures.
The page of Low’s drawings concerning the
scarcity of artists’ material and the use
of his shirt-front for sketching on (B.
23/12/T5) recalls an episode in the London
life of Phil May. It was at the Savage
Club one Saturday evening, and a number ot
us had declared our intention of not going
home till morning. We were having a final
final, in order, I remember, to toast Phil,
who had been the success of the smoke-night
with his comic lecture and lightning chalk-
drawings. He was beaming behind a big
cigar, with his pencils and chalks bulging
out of his vest pocket. One of the roy-
sterers, immaculate in evening dress, pressed
the ever-good-natured artist for a souvenir.
May had no drawing-paper, but his fellow-
Savage swelled out his starched shirt-lront.
“Draw it on this,” lie urged. Phil pro-
ceeded to oblige, and his friend took home a
weird and wonderful and wobbly design in
colored chalks.

Herbert Palmer is the Melbourne journal-
ist who runs the Imperial Review, which
is unlike any other in the world. Palmer,
calling himself “Demos,” writes, it all. Stolen,
he says frankly, every bit of it: that is to
say, Palmer steals wisdom wherever he finds
it and points it with his own wit. And
simply because the supply neither of other
people’s wisdom nor Palmer’s own wit is
the same at all seasons, the editor-publisher
never knows exactly when the next number
will issue. So far there have been nearly
60 spread over about quarter of a century,
and getting a notice even in the Encyclo-
paedia Britannica.

“8.0. C.” : Curious what notions the daily
press has at times of its “rights.” Recently
at Adelaide, in a suit for nullity of mar-
riage, an application was made for trial
in camera. Judge Gordon said that as the
petitioner was a lady of 54, who had ven-
tured into matrimony a second time, he saw
no reason why he should not hear the case
nubliclv. Next day Tiie Register came
out with a yarn headed “Rights of the Press
Upheld”; and, of course, a report of the
evidence in another column. Now if any
rights at all were “upheld,” they were those
not of the press but of the public. It
isn’t much of a right at the besft, and, any-
way, is a very different thing from the
“right” to publish unpleasant details. As a
matter of fact Gordon in this case departed
from the usual practice, which is. that m
cases where the ground of action is semi-
nhvsiological the cause shall be detei mined
in camera. He did this, apparently, be-
cause he thought the petitioner old and
experienced enough to give details in the
presence of all and sundry. It seems a bad
reason. The object of trial with closed
doors is not so much to spare witnesses
their confusion as to prevent the court
loafer the prurient office-boy and unhealthy
females gloating over evidence usually
breathed into the ear of a medical adviser,
and, incidentally, to prevent a high-minded
daily press earning a crust by publishing
the garbage—-at Id. per helping.
THE POET’S PLAINT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Nothing but dreams have I to sell,
And the demand is slight, it seems;
So profitless -the tales I tell
In verses weaved from webs of dreams —
Nothing but dreams!
Dream-verse tinged with ocean’s blue;
Green as the fields of joy are green;
All spangled o’er with morning’s dew,
And bathed at night in pale moon’s sheen—•
The moonlight’s sheen.
But still, alas! howe’er I try,
To sell my dreams I find most hard;
The soulless read, then make reply:
“We’ve got a moon in our backyard—
Our own backyard 1”
My visioned valleys lure them not,
My houris set no hearts awhirl;
The Philistine cares not a jot
Save for a living, breathing girl—
A solid girl!
No shadow-cabbage could be sold,
Nor spirit-spuds, nor phantom-steak ;
Nor could one buy with dream-made gold ;
No bogus beer a thirst would slake —
No thirst would slake.
So beerless through the world I go,
Though hours I spend in writing reams,
Few quidlets to my coffers flow,
For I have nought to sell but dreams—
But idle dreams!
VICTORIA.

Advice to
Nursing Mothers
MANY mothers would like to feed their
own children, but are denied the privilege
of doing so, because they have not suffi-
cient nourishment for them. The “Allenburys”
scientific system of Infant Feeding has provided
for all this. When a mother is partly able to
feed her baby she may give The "Allenburys" Milk
Food No. I for alternate feeds, so alike are the
natural and prepared food in this instance, and this
food should be continued until the weaning process
has been entirely completed. The mother herself
must be well nourished and to this end may .partake
freely of the "Allenburys" DIET a partially pre-
digested milk and wheaten food, which like the
Milk Food No. 1, is instantly made ready for use
by simply adding boiling water only. After
childbirth the “Allenburys" DIET is surprisingly
helpful in maintaining the strength and producing
a good flow of rich milk.

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

Another Beautiful
Rexona Girl.
Miss JEAN ROBERTSON,

Miss Jean Robertson, one
of the most beautiful of
the bevy of Rexona girls,
has never had to toil up
from the lowest rung of the
Stage Ladder. She jumped
into a big' part on her first
appearance with the
Willoughby management.
Among her many striking
successes during a two
years’ stage experience have
been her Lilian Maitland
in “The Silence of Dean
Maitland” and her Princess
Venetia in “Under Two
Flags,” with Ethel Buckley,
another Rexona girl in the
lead as “Cigarette.” Miss
Robertson, who is an
Adelaide native, writes :
Years ago I heard of
your wonderful Rexona
from a friend of mine
who could not find
words to give it praise
enough. As I was need-
ing something of this
kind for an injured
hand I purchased a
small pot, and I con-
gratulate you on your
wonderful remedy. It
is certainly a most mar-
vellous healer, much in
advance of anything I
have ever come across
before. I am also going
to try a cake of your
Rexona Soap, for I hear
that it is splendid, and am going to see for myself if it is in keeping
with Rexona. Rexona and I shall always be friends in the future, and I
will never lose an opportunity of telling my friends about it.
Yours truly, (Signed) JEAN RORERTSON.
EVERYBODY’S USING IT NOW.

DON’T gape like that! There’s work to

You’ve got to get the milking through,
\nd there’s that stump I’ll have to grub.
The cows are waiting in the scrub—
\oW stir your bones, and take the track.
Your father speaks. Don’t answer back !
It’s no good staring at the sky ;
You'll only see the clouds pass by.
You’re here to work. What’s that you say?
I know you want to run away,
Ihit how? With crippled brother Ted,
And mother lyin’ sick in bed?
Y'ou’ve got her pale, reproachful face.
I hate you both, your airs and grace.
Don’t scowl at me! I’ll stand no more—
A stockwhip’s hanging on the door.
I'll see you don’t escape until
I’ve broke you to your father’s will!
You’re too refined for storm and rain—
You look across the wild bare plain
To see if someone comes ! No sound
Y’ou’ll hear, the soaking paddocks round —-
No horseman plunging through the mud—
But mad creeks roaring in the flood.
And you can curse the lonely life,
The howling wind, the bitter strife,
The scrubby farm —and plot and plan
To leave me when your soldier-man
Returns to take his girl away !
But I'm the boss, and here you’ll stay.
Mind that! I don’t suppose you know
That fool was shot two months ago
At —God knows where, by Turkish shells.
He’ll settle at the Dardanelles,
And come no more with lying vows....
Don't stare !... .He’s dead. .. .Bring in the

The Yards of Pain.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WALTER ROSSITTER, managing-
director of the Kundi-Kundi Pas-
toral Company, rode from the head
station over the sandy rises, through belts
of bauhinia and coolibah, to the branding
yards on Eastern Creek. He cantered not
easily, for the mare he rode had not suckled
her foal that morning, and her thoughts
were on her milk and not her work. The
time, three hours after sunrise; the air
breathing lightly to the sunlight; a flock of
galahs in their artistic dress of pink and
grey; the flying snow that was ten thousand
corellas wheeling as they spread their slanted
wings in the eye of the sun; a thousand
crows on two hundred trees; a string of ibis
flying before Rossitter easterly, as he rode
through the coolibah and the funereal gidya
and the bright green of the emu-apple—vivid
as flame among the sage-green.
A year ago had'seen the end of the latest
drought; and the tremendous resilience of
Australia made an abundance which shouted
the lie that drought and death had never
been in all the world. And with life vocal
all around him Walter Rossitter, his pipe
drawing well, and all things glad, excepting
the mare with her mind upon her milk, rode
to the branding. The track wound through
country unlike that to the west of Kundi-
Ivundi, where are black soil, Mitchell and
Flinders grass—a hundred fragrant miles of
hay. Here were kangaroo and silver grass
m tussocks; summer grass dropping to pow-
der on the stalk; spinifex and red-soil flats
strewed white and black with quartz and
>«n; and red anthills; and, then, grassy
little plains and bauhinia trees dropping
yellow pods to the teeming earth. Because
of the splendor of the plenty there had to be
the horror of the flies, so that thirty inches
of rain might not represent the millennium.
lor sounds, there were the cawing of the
crows, smelling blood before it was shed ; the
shrieks of corella and galah, going before
wossitter’s mare to tell the bush that Man
the Destroyer rode to the branding; the end-
mSS chatter of those jays men call the
twelve Apostles—preaching in and out of
season, crying, “I’ll hide ! I’ll hide ! Here’s
a horseman! I’ll hide!” and never hiding, or
rp n<ll “B ev . en the half-concealment of silence,
wn ’•he right, and ahead, Rossitter saw a
P' ar of dust 30ft. high; it was the advance
the cattle to the branding-yards. Whip-
racks and barkings from invisible men and
ogs came from the haze as the crackle of

the the saddle as he heard
behind him ° f le smaller dust-cloud close
this m,,n sa w .that he was leading in
speckled, dun,
red and roan; tottering calves of all the
variants of these; and the leader, a clean-
skin, two-year-old roan, his muscles rippling
under a coat of satin, a belly white as swans-
down, and horns and hoofs lustrous as if
they had been spoke-shaved and polished.
Rossitter looked at that leadef, and almost
regretted that the splendid animal, although
a scrubber, must lose his sex. Then, still
sitting half-turned in the saddle, he saw the
clean-skin shy to the right and stop, trem-
bling, until the press of the cows urged him
on, and he knew that the roan had seen for
the first time a death of blood —the carcase
of a bullock killed in the yards and horse-
hauled to this spot, with the hawks wheeling
and swooping over it, afraid in all that noise
and horror of movement to settle on the car-
case, but wheeling, swooping and feeding to
the glut.
The sight had almost paralysed the roan ;
he shambled on trembling ; the dust-cloud at
the yards cleared ; and, beyond them, Rossit-
ter saw a bunch of cattle' that had been
clean-skins that morning, and had but now
made their passage through Hell, being
steadied by horsemen back to the sanctuary
of their illimitable pastures. Then Hell re-
opened ; and for the new mob.
Column of dust, pillar of cloud; mad
rushes in and about the yards; curses and
animal noises ; cattle rushing and ringing in
the yards when the wind brought the smell
of fresh blood ; stenches of beasts perspiring
fear, of reeking, sweating hide, of over-
driven, over-terrified cattle; mad bullocks
with blood from sudden de-horning in their
staring eyes! The splendor of the roan was
blurred in ten minutes of that madness of
rushing, of that lunacy of demanding obedi-
ence of animals which could not understand.
The beauty that rippled under his roan coat
of satin was muddied with blood and dirt;
his lustrous horns were broken; he blew his
nostrils thin with fear; the brown of clotted
blood was on the once-glossy whiteness of his
belly; and, so discounted, they penned him
in the yard.
They forced him through the yards, as the
cows were rapidly separated from the calves.
He went madly, to the accompaniment of the
cows’ bellowings of terror and defiance and
the calves’ answering cries of misery and
farewell. At last they had him in the crush ;
and the minor operations but stung him.
Then from the sky came the brand ; “K bar
K” in letters of flame ; the cry for help, for
pity and revenge, strangled in his dried
mouth by the strength of his agony. The
zealous blacks held the iron too long, so
that the skin was burned through, and the
prolonged pain spoiled hide and wasted
money. Rossitter had dismounted at the
calf-yard, and now leaned against the rails,
watching the branding. A tremendously
important nigger slipped the hauling rope
over a calf’s head; and, at his call, a half-
grown blackboy drove the horse out from the
yard, and dragged the choking calf up to the
rails. A rope, thrown around his hind-feet,
brought him crashing to the dust; blunted
ear-markers cut a boomerang in the ear, and
a movement of the operator’s hand to the
operator’s body tore out the piece ; the man
at the hind legs emasculated the calf, still
too dazed to cry out; and a blackboy ran
from the gidya fire without the yard, and
passed through the rails the hissing brands.
They gave it to the calf in three acts. As
the iron singed the hair the calf sweated
horror ; the pretentious nigger pressed home
the smoking irons; the air lost the odor of
dust and grew rank with the smell of flesh
and hide grilling in torment. And then
agony loosened the tongue fear had tied. A
cry for help and pity—the cry to man, the
sun, the sky and all that is, for mercy;
uttered in the sound used by all living things
in pain, man or beast —a long-drawn-out
“Oooh!” ended only by exhaustion. They
loosed the ropes; the calf, burning around
the brand, but not in it, for the iron had
destroyed all feeling in its path, was loosened
of its lariats, and staggered to its feet.
Stupid with pain it stood where it arose,
knowing not where to go.
“By Crise ! That one dam’ ’toopid feller
altogether,” said the pretentious nigger; and
with his heavy Cossack boot he kicked the
calf in the head.
“Don’t do that again !” shouted Rossitter,
angrily. , .
The pretentious black man turned in sur-
nrise. T
“What matter that one?” he asked. 1
) een kickem calf.” .
“I know —and you do it again I kickem
J/OM.” .
He turned to the stockman. Where this
feller come from, Harley?’
“I picked him up about two months ago;
he never learned the job till this muster ; but
he’s quick.” . . . ,
“He’s too damned quick with that boot.
What do you call him?”
“He’s a Ritta Titta. Ilis own people call
him Mold. That means the house-fly. So
we call him Blowfly for short.’
“All right! Blowfly.”
“Yowi! Marmi?” ’
“You no been kickem calf. Too much
hurt that one calf already—alonga earmark
and brand. Sposem been kickem calf, I been
kickem you big feller. That one cruel you
no been kickem altogether.”
He turned away, and was followed by
Harley. The big, pretentious black looked
after them, puzzled.
“Burnem name alonga that one call;
tearem ear out close up—then he say no
been kickem that one ! ‘Croo-ul’ What name
that one? ‘Croo-ul!’ My word!”
Wonderingly he went back to his work of
commercialised torture, branding and muti-
lating all day; till in the dusk the lowings
of pain, hunger, sorrow and milk-stress were
silenced by re-union; agony forgotten, as
cow and calf found each other again, in the
taking of milk and the giving thereof, the
memory of separation and the sorrow of the
branding almost as if they had never been.
Almost! But not!
There were whimperings of old pain heard
all night. In the moonlight, hazy with the
dust that hung in the still air, there was a
big shadow with a little shadow at foot.
The little shadow stopped sucking; the
smarting of the brands made it cry for com-
passion.
“Mother,” sobbed Little Shadow, “they
burned a name upon my hide.”
“Son,”, said Big Shadow, “everything

ONE OF OUR
GALLIPOLI HEROES
Gives Zam-Buk Great Praise.

Divisional
Engineers,

praises
Zam-Buk.

JMJJ
Hr. William Coulthard, of 30 O’Grady
Street, North Carlton, Melbourne, is in
receipt of an interesting letter from
his son George who is a Driver
attached to the 2nd Field Company,
Divisional Engineers, Mex Camp, Alex-
andria, Egypt in the course of which
he makes appreciative references to the
efficacy of Zam-Buk.
Driver Coulthard has been on active
service with his Company of Engi-
neers since August, 1914, “ and,”
continues Mr. Coulthard, “he
says that he would not be
without Zam-Buk. He sus-
tained a wound to one of
his hands, which led to
septic poisoning, and the
hand became very bad and
extremely painful. Having
a supply of Zam-Buk on
hand, he applied dressings
of the Balm, which cleansed
the wound of all germs and dirt,
thus preventing serious complications in the
way. of blood-poison ensuing. Zam-Buk then
healed the wound quickly and perfectly.
“ My son says he recommends Zam=Buk to anyone who may
be suffering from a poisoned wound, as he was.”
OUR SOLDIERS WANT MORE ZAM-BUK.
Keep a pot of Zam-Buk
handy for sunburn,
rashes, prickly heat,
cuts, burns, bruises,

passes. I was once burned so. Ruck to thy
comfort, little son.”
And the little shadow’s head nuzzled the
generous teat again.
Blowfly had another week of it —long,
bright, hot days, full of cattle rushes; mad
beasts, energetic dogs, and the man at one
with the horse, so that the horse almost anti-
cipated him ; cries of agony, and smell of the
burning. And then Blowfly’s great dramatic
season was ended, and they drafted him into
Kundi-Kundi, where he was as nothing, odd-
jobs man, wood-and-water-joey to come when
called and be instant for little reason and
fervent in doing next-to-nothing. The tall,
from the doing of great deeds with steel and
fire, hurt Blowfly’s importance in his own
eyes. He had become used to branding and
holding down the struggling calf with a boot
firmly placed upon the neck; he liked the
excitement of the cattle-rushing, and the
energy of movement; and in this dead sea he
grew morose. To moroseness succeeded I<\7A-
ness ; so that he hated even the sinecure of
wood-and-water-joey. The black has a com-
mandment which is the intellectual white
man’s eleventh; and it is, “Thou shalt not be
bored.” . , .
Therefore he was about to begin to thinK
of absconding to the bush, and becoming a
walk-about blackfellow again, when he saw,
near the blacks’ huts, a great gohanna—more
than six feet long, making ridiculous move-
ments in the attempt to swallow _ the con-
nected bones which had once carried a leg
of mutton. ~
Blowfly saw the gohanna, and a great idea
came to him. The gohanna saw Blowfly, and,
probably, enough also of the great idea to
fear the menace behind it. So the gohanna
ran for his life. Then Blowfly sat down to
think for two days. In that two days he
encouraged the visits of the gohanna with
meat and mutton bones; and, on the third
day, he collected a store of dead gidya
branches and the sharp twigs of the turpen-
tine. Next he suspended from a tree-branch
a rope with a running loop: and in the tree
he hung three bail-ropes, borrowed from the
milkers’ shed. Below, and in advance of,
the running loop he placed a beef rib-bone as
bait; and, then, in the forenoon, he ascended
;e tree and waited. . ,
The great gohanna came out or the uusn,
his little eyes greedy with anticipation; he
looked around, and seeing no man ran at
the bait and choked as the noose tightened.
Chuckling joyously, Blowfly almost fell out
of the tree in his haste, seized the suspended
bail ropes, and, avoiding the threshing of
the formidable tail, quickly made the hal -
strangled gohanna fast by the fore and hind
feet and by his tail. Then, having
stretched the ropes fore and aft, so that the
gohanna was held rigidly, he loosened the
noose, slipped it from the neck to the head,
and bound the golianna’s jaws. The little
eyes, enlarged by terror, looked at Blowfly,
asking mercy while threatening revenge.
Then Blowfly lighted the gidya wood and
placed the brands in the fire. At the appli-
cation of the first brand the great lizard
seemed as if he would break the ropes; but
Blowfly, knowing him secure, went blithely
about the work of branding until the ago-
nised thing below him felt new pains in
the cessation of pain. Blowfly looked down
with pride at the legend burned into the
gchanna’s flank —“Iv bar K.” „
“Mv word! Good feller calf that one,
said Blowfly. “Now no been losem alto-
gether.”
And then came Nemesis with a stock-
whip—otherwise Walter Rossitter, and Har-
ley, and Larry and Paddy, the black stock-
“ You cruel dog!” shouted W alter Ros-
sitter, as Blowfly revolved like a top to the
whip. “He’s a devil, Harley ! Look at the
.brand on that gohanna. Tie him up, Paddy !
Tie him up.” , , ,
Harley cautiously freed the gohanna, and
stood respectfully aside w T hile the reptile
fled madly towards the Indian Ocean—
which is, from Kundi-Kundi, about two
thousand miles almost due west. The stock-
men tied up to the tree the brander of wild
animals, and Walter Rossitter laid on the
bail-rope until Blowfly begged, not for
mercy, but only for a little respite, because
“that one rope makem breath go crooked
inside altogether.”
The blacks cast him off, and Rossitter,
nearly all his anger departed, said : “I told
you sposem cruel longa calf I beatem you ;
then you bad feller, make it cruel alonga
gohanna. You been do him no more alto-
gether ? ,J
“All right that one,” replied the wincing
blackman very humbly. “Sposem you not
wantem brand gohanna, I no been brandem
any more that one altogether.”
“S’pose me been wantem brand, then me
had feller—that one cruel. . Altogether been
bad! How you know —eh?”
“Marmi,” replied the sore and puzzled
one, “when you been talkem that one, fore-
head belongem me go away. When me been
brandem calf, tearem ear out close up alto-
gether, burnem calf alonga brand, you been
say ‘Good boy.’ Now I brandem gohanna you
beatem me altogether. What name?”
“Brandem calf all right,” said Walter
Rossitter, but with less confidence than he
had known for years, for the logical com-
parison staggered him a little, “that one
gohanna brandem —no good that one.
Brandem calf all right.”
“Why brandem gohanna. wrong altogether,
sposem brandem calf all right?”
“Well! Well! Er!....Don’t you talk to
me, 810wf1y.... Gohanna belongem bush; no
money that one. Calf belongem station.”
“All right! Gohanna belongem station
too.” , „
“Don’t talk ! er —er ! Brandem gohanna
that one cruel.... Brandem calf that one
—that one —er —business.”
And he rvent away quickly, to signify
that the cross-examination of himself was
closed. , . ~ , _ , „
Blowfly winced under his shirt, and philo-
sophy came to help the martyr; but it could
not help him to the outlook of the white
man. . , ,
“Brandem gohanna. said the deeply-stung
Blowfly, as he searched for cooling lily_ pads
in the half-mooned lagoon of Kundi-Kundi,
“that one croo-ul. My word ! Brandem
calf, burnem leg alonga calf, tearem ear out
alonga ear-marker close up—that one ‘Biz-
ness’l My word! Bizness! By Gripes,
good feller bizness that, one, close up cut him
back off belongem me altogether.”
On the verandah of the “Government
House” of Kundi-Kundi Walter Rossitter
thought out a new attitude for himself on
the subject of branding. He also wondered
if the branding of gohannas would be. cruel
if gohannas suddenly found a place in the
market and a quotation in the stock reports.
“There’s roguery in all games but mine -
whatever it is,” said he, grinning to him-
self. “That and pulling a flat-bottomed punt
against the stream. And I brand twelve
thousand calves a year; and draw the line
at torturing the unsaleable.”
Yet the reflection did not prevent him
regarding with joy the cattle feeding on the
rise before the homestead, animals who. were
not life, but dividends for Kundi-Kundi.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
Confessions.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I FELT enormously relieved. The
arrest had come a little sooner than I
expected, and the night in the Maori
Flat lock-up had been horrible; but this
police gaol was comfortable enough. Any-
how, this was the dead end, and my worry-
ing and scheming days and brooding nights
were over. The gaoler was fat, genial and
chatty, and his only trouble with me was
the inventory of the belongings that I had
to hand over. ~
“‘Portmanther,’ is ut, bedad? he said.
“ ‘Bag’ it goes down- wid me. An] ‘undher-
vest’ —sure, ‘shirt’ it’ll be in my list. -
In the little wire-covered yard were five
casuals. One was doing twenty-eight days,
and had the tally marked in pencil on the
wall. The other four had forty-eight hours
apiece. They sat listlessly, a little dilapi-
dated, and wearing the fading flush of last
night’s glorious bender. . One kept filling
the tin pannikin at the tap. They all eyed
my good clothes and general turn-out with
suspicion. Scotty told me afterwards, ** e
all thoct you was one o’ the dahm D’s.
In the morning, however, some word of
what I was had got through to them, and
Scotty was soon in the thick of confidences.
“Twenty-eight days I’m tae do,” he said.
“The vag they have me for —me that has
worrked harrder than most! Min’ ye,, I
hae made ma easy money whiles, too._ Dye
min’ tellin’ me noo exactly what this em-
bezzlement is?”
I explained.
“Aye, I thoct so, an’ Hoppy there was
tellin’ me ye had robbed a bank. All said
tae him ye looked too hairmless for sic a
thing. Ye got a gran’ lot o’ siller a’ the
same, I’m dootin?”
There was nothing for me to say,. so be
told his tale of easy money, and his blue
eyes glowed as he did it.
" “I min’ the time I was in Brisbone, an’
anither chap an’ me we managed to get away
wi’ a bundle o’- proposal forrums for. the
Perennial Fire Insurance an’ a lot o’ ither
papers that a canvasser who was yellin’ fou
left in the smokin’ room. We went away
oot into the country wi’ the things and we
dune real well. I’ll gie ye oor plan.
“I’d call at a fairm house and intraeduce
masel’ as representing the Perennial Fire
Office, an’ I wad inspect the barm an’ the
stable an’ so on, an’ the fairmer wad sign
the forrum. He had only to pay a deposit
until he got the real policy from ma. head
office. This you will unnerstan’ was to
impress on the man my bonny tides. But I
wad gie him a flash-lookin’ temp’ry policy
forrum wi’ blue letterin’ to it, an’ wad
explain that he was insured an’ that if a
fire broke oot that very nicht he wad get his
money.
“Then after a while I wad gie him a look
an’ say, ‘Aye, it’s a haird maister yon Insur-
ance Company. They gie a mon a meesar-
able salary an’ none too guid in the matter
o’ expenses.’
“An’ maybe we wad hae a tot or two, an’
after a wee bit o’ a crack I wad agree for
three or four poun’ to pit perhaps three
hunder’ o’ insurance on an old barrn worth
no more nor fifty poun’. Three times oot o’
four it wad come off, an’ it’s the truth I’m
tellin’ ye, we wad sometimes see the re-
flaxion o’ the flames as we was leavin’ in
the train. Of course you will unnerstan’
we had to cover a terrible lot o’ groun’ wi’
a game like yon • an’ very heavy expense.
Maybe now wi’ your experience ye could
pit a man in the way o’ a few bob —not,
min’ ye, that I.’m frightened o’ worrk, but” —
The yard door opened and the sergeant
beckoned to me. “Come along, lad,” he
said, “your bail’s arranged.”
I have planted some tens of thousands of
trees since then, and have never seen Scotty
again; but the scheme seems good.
EX GENT.
Brutal Love Song.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I WANT no tame, chlorotic girl
To wive for me and bear me brood ;
Give me a wench whose glances hurl
Red challenge to impetuous blood,
That I may match her force with mine and
prove her worth to womanhood!
These tepid, pliant, boudoir things
That hide their guile in weakness’ guise,
Who’d have Love mince in leading strings,
A petted captive fed on sighs,
A prettyling. w r ell combed and sleek —a
curse on their licentious lies !
I want a woman, rude as Earth,
So I to her be fertile rain ;
The worth of me would match her worth,
And all her body be a fane
Where I should worship paganly and, met-
tlesome, be man again.
And those bold looks of her would change
To molten tenderness of mood ;
Forest and flood and mountain range
I’d hunt to win her worthy food,
And, happy in our savage way, she’d rear
for me a splendid brood.
