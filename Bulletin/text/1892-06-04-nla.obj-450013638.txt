This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading college!
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN

He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may bo eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to M)
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

gressions or excesses of more nature ago, bladder

DR. KELLY’S REPUTATION IS SO THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT IT WILD
ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
THE GREATER PORTION OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY FAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES. MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER,
ARE UNAWARE OF HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED FROM
ADVERTISING. HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OF HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS OF ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
DISTRICTS WHERE HIS REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOES SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR. KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALL AS FOLLOWS
IF THERE IS A PERSON ON EARTH TO BE PITIED IT IS HE WHO IS OBLIGED
TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FELLOW BEINGS WHILE HIS MIND IS CONSTANTLY
HARASSED AND TORTURED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OP
WHAT MUST INEVITABLY FOLLOW.
HE LOOKS HAGGARD AND SHEEPISH. HE IS NERVOUS IN PUBLIC, AND EXTREMELY
GIRLISH AND BACKWARD IN LADIES’ SOCIETY. THE VICTIM OP THIS, THE MOST
DANGEROUS OP ALL VICES, IP NOT RELIEVED, SOON REACHES A STATE WHICH MUST
END IN LIFE-LONG MISERY. HE MUST ULTIMATELY SINK TO THE LOWEST STAGE
OP DEGRADATION AND SHAME. DR. KELLY MAINTAINS THAT THE PHYSICIAN WHO
HAS THE POWER TO CURB, AND REMAINS SILENT, IS GUILTY OF AN UNPARDONABLE
SIN OF OMISSION. PERSONS WHO READ HIS GREAT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILL
BE SHOWN THE INEVITABLE RESULT OP THE BAD HABITS, AND IN MOST
INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO BEE THEIR FOLLY -
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OP THEM. THE BOOK WILL ALSO
SHOW THEM CLEARLY
HOW TO CURE THE DISEASE WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE,
DR. KELLY’S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE.
THEREFORE, EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE FROM DISEASE, SEND FOR THIS GREAT
MEDICAL WORK, THAT YOU MAY BE ENABLED TO ADVISE OTHERS AFTER PERUSING
ITS PAGES. VERY FREQUENTLY THIS MAY BE DONE BEFORE ANY GREAT HAEM
HAS TAKEN PLACE.

“THE BULLETIN."
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly-Australia's Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,"
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dii
tinctive Australian National policy,
Tub Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government,
One Person, one Vote,
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World,
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
k Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
% ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction,
A new Parliamentary System— one House to
. be elected by constituencies as at present 5
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency,
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner*
ship of Land,
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “ nobility.’’
The public eye rejects as uninteresting mors
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic}
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is nob
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
pud has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form —printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established A us-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the. bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

The Kanaka Slave-Trade “ Regulations.”
Samuel Griffith, Premier of Queensland
and principal slave-dealer to that province
and his Government have now issued the
formal regulations under which the Kanaka
industry is to be resumed in the South Seas
i here are a good many dozens of these regu-
lations, and they cover nearly every cir-
cumstance that can possibly happen to a
Kanaka except the circumstance of his not
wanting to be recruited at all, and desiring
to remain in peace beneath his palm-tree
Ihe one great feature of the new slave-trade
is that it is to rest upon a purely moral basis
and the odour of sanctity is to be over it all.
-there is to be no more shooting, or drown-
mg, or kidnapping of the wretched islanders.
Ihe Government Agent is never again to
receive a share of the profits on condition
that he lets things slide and enters in his W
that the murdered Polynesian died of fevei°
ihe captain is to be clothed and in his ri'dit
mmd, and is never to get drunk and smash
things any more, neither are he and the
agent to quarrel wildly and go on orgies
with the mate, and neither of them is" 3 to
make the agent overlook any chance enor-
mities by threatening to throw him over-
board some dark night if he refuses. There
is to be no more greed of gain in their
souls, and if the voyage is unlucky they
are never, under any circumstances, to
give way to temptation and resort to
extreme measures to collect a cargo.
Neither the captain nor the mate nor
the Government Agent are ever again to
look with a sinful eye on the Polynesian girl
who is young and beautiful, and the boat-
swain is to rise superior to the lusts of the
flesh - it is provided that he shall do so in
the regulations. Everything, in short, is to
be altogether pure and beautiful, for any-
thing that isn’t pure and beautiful is for-
bidden by no less than 38 bye-laws, and the
entire traffic has been washed and made clean
by Act of Parliament.

There are many new and godly features in
the new system—features which were alto-
gether unknown in the unholy past. The
female Kanaka is to get four flannel petti-
coats annually and two hats, whereas she only
got two flannel petticoats and one hat in the
days when Gkifj’ith stumped (lie country
and called down fire and brimstone on the
murderous slave-trade and all connected
therewith Now he is the chief advocate of
the trade, but the two exlra petticoats and
10 additional hat will stand between him
<md the wrath which is to come. The male
Kanaka is to get an extra pair of pants
annually, and he also will got the extra hat
which was denied him in the unregencrate
(.lays. An extra half-pound of meat is to be
allowed daily, and the blankets served out
aio not— except with the special permission
ot the Munster—to weigh less than Gibs.
1 igs and dogs— which used to bo allowed—
aie not to bo kept on board any labour
vessel, and each schooner is to be furnished
with “a modern and approved medical work
on the treatment of diseases,” so that the
captain can diagnose any islander who isn’t
feeling well. Liquors, excepting rum, are
to be carried in bottles instead of kegs, and
the boats used in recruiting are each to have
lo gallons of fresh water on board—presum-
ably lest the recruited Polynesian should
eel dry. No male, “unless accompanied
by the Government Agent ha, ha !—is to
enter the women’s compartment on board.
■Recruiting on Sundays is strictlv prohibited
as an evil circumstance that is calculated to
call down a curse upon the industry ; and it
is enacted that the Government Agent is
always to be “decently and becomingly
cliessed, and to wear two gold cords round
Ins sleeves and hat, and a crown in gold
embroidery on the front of the latter.
I rom this item it would almost seem as if
the agent of the old days was not dressed
decently. Rumour asserts that he was often
chunk, and possibly he went ashore in a
dressing-gown in his irresponsible moments,
and held orgies with the chief, and thus
brought his nation and his office into well-
merited contempt.
* * «
The new code is strictly pious in all its
tendencies. It is especially enacted that
every recruit, male and female, is to be
supplied with clothing immediately upon
embarkation. In the majority of cases the
islander arrives in a state of nakedness, and
the unregenerate agent of the olden time
used to allow him to remain therein,
whereby he made an exhibition of himself
on deck, contrary to the spirit of the British
Constitution. Also, it is expressly enacted
that the agent shall not permit any married
woman to join the ship unless he ’is “abso-
lutely certain that she is accompanied by her
own husband.” In former times she might
come along with anybody else’s husband, or
she might have two or more husbands, or
lor husband might bring a harem, 'or the
married woman might come alone, while her
husband openly eloped with another girl on
the beach, but these immoral proceWlino-s
are now to be a thing of the past. The
agent is to hunt up and note the relation-
slups of the recruits in fact, the childlike
faith which the Government places in this
lone and helpless functionary is a touching
thing to witness. He is to enter the name
ot every recruit, which name is often an
unpronounceable thing consisting of two
whistles and a click, and lias no earthly
equivalent in the English language. He is
expected to remember each recruit, and
prevent them getting mixed. He is obviously
required to be able to converse with them all
m their 30 or 40 mixed languages, and he is
to note the islands they came from, and the
age height, and fighting weight of each one.
If the captain, mate, boatswain, cook, or
anybody else commits any breach of the Act,
the agent is to rise up, alone upon that great
waste of waters, and stop him. If any other
captain should, to his knowledge, break the
Act, he is to keep an eye on that individual,
and report him. He is to look after the
luggage of the Kanaka* which is probably an
unknown quantity, and his morals, which
are probably as small as his luggage, and the
captain s morals, and those of the crew. Ho
is to see that a certain cubic space is allowed
to each Kanaka, and that he has five square
feet of deck space to walk upon. He is to
plant every returned islander on the exact
spot of ground where ho was originally
recruited, instead of shoving him on to the
first island he may find. He is responsible
for food, clothing, medicine, and tobacco :
he is to be a doctor and a father and an uncle
and a dry-nurse to the whole ship-load of
I olynesians ; he is to look after
and enter everything in his log, and be a
compound of Moses and Solomon upon the
high seas, and if he even thinks anything
that is contrary to the Act there are thirty”
eight regulations which will fall upon him
there and then arid bring him up with a
shock.
• * #
Yet it is all pious hypocrisy and thin pre-
tence, and the spirit of the slave-dealing
Stiuoins is in the new Kanaka trade as it
was in the old. If the miserable agent, with
II is, fpjflcd hat and his infinitesimal salary
and Ins load of regulations, keeps square all
will be well ; also, under the same impossible
condition all would have been well in former
times—but then the agent never did keep
square and never will, and he will die sud-
denly by accident if he tries to. If he is too
particular and thus spoils the trade his life
on board is practically a hell. The captain,
the mate, and the crew have all, most pro-
babiy, a share in the profits, and the solitary
individual who interferes with these profits
is the common enemy. Therefore, if he
goes ashore anywhere he is liable to be
marooned, and if he stands too near the rail
on a dark night lie is liable to go overboard,
and his food is apt to bo poisoned, or las
liquor to be doctored, and heavy blocks drop
unaccountably from aloft when ho is about,
and even if he gets ashore in safety, the
captain may swear an information against him
concerning the alleged seduction or murder of
some Polynesian maiden, and all the crew
may attest it, and get him sent to lifelong
imprisonment. And, on the other hand, if
he lets things slide, and merely makes a
daily entry in the log that all is correct, he
can load a pleasant existence, and avoid all
risks, and save an enormous amount of
labour, and live in good fellowship with all
his companions, and get a share in the
profits, which will probably treble, or more
than treble, his salary. The successful
agent of the old days always got a share in
the profits, and most of the new ones will go
the same road, and those who do not will
be seized with some fatal complaint upon
the voyage, and a neat memorandum in
the log-book will explain that they perished
through fever, and were buried amid the
tears of all hands,-and the hysterical prostra-
tion of the cook.
• * #
When once the agent is bought over
in the inevitable fashion, the whole niora-
.y of the system vanishes away. He
is to serve out clothes to the naked recruit,
but so long as he makes an entry in his book
that he has done so the ship may carry an
unclad harem all over the Pacific. The law
requires that he shall, by way of respect for
the seventh commandment, carry away no
Kanaka matron unaccomplanied by her hus-
band, but the old Government Agent used
to elope personally with the Kanaka matron
if she was young and comely, and the new
one will do the same. It is his business to
Keep the captain sober, for the skij>per of a
few years ago used to have horrors all the
voyage, and to see snakes and griffins among
the islands, but unhappily the agent of these
days also had horrors and was subject to
snakes, and his successor will go the same
way. The result is absolutely inevitable.
It is a recognised fact that the police force is
woefully corrupt and given to taking tips
and giving false evidence and other sins,
yet every policeman is watched by a sergeant,
and the sergeant has the eye of the sub-
inspector upon him, and the latter official is
bossed by the district inspector, and the
superintendent or commissioner, and the
Colonial Secretary, and the Parliament, and
the magistrates and judges all exercise a
certain amount of supervision, and each
policeman has his eye more or less upon his
neighbour, and the public inspects the whole
lot. With all these counter-checks the
constable s morality is not above suspicion.
hat then is to be expected from that other
officer who is a species of policeman at sea
with no superior officer within a thousand
nulos or more to supervise him-a lonesome
* k |a, t P . w ; *th the whole Pacific for his beat,
and tip all round, and no public eye upon
him from one horizon to the other ?
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The West Australian Slave.
Every now and then there come from West
Australia rumours of strange doings among the
niggers of that benighted province. West
Australians the mystery land of this continent,
it suffered so long under the blessings of Im-
perial rule that there is no public sentiment
worth mentioning in the province, and not even
a decent gallows-aborigines and Chinamen
being hung on trees in the back regions for want
ol the proper apparatus of extirpation. There
is no democratic party in West Australia as
yet; there is no newspaper that dare go into
details about any atrocities so long as they are
committed by a person of property ; there is no
manhood suffrage—no Parliamentary Opposition
to iciise a riot about the evil deeds of the
Government party, not because it objects to
them but because it wants to get office—there
is nothing, in fact, but an unfinished land-boom
and stagnation. Every prosperous shark is a
J.l. in the \v cst, and among them they run the
Mate, and no one who is not a shark lias any
say in public affairs. Kidnapping in Western
Australia is reduced to a science. When the
boss of the soil wants some cheap labourer to till
Ins land, and shear his sheep, and chop wood,
and carry water, and do all manner of work
gratis, he goes on the war-trail with
sundry energetic assistants, and presently
rounds up some 40 or 50 aborigines from
the adjacent tribes. He promises them
certain flaring cheap calicoes for the gins,
tind unlimited nun for the rest of the
party, and creates a general impression that the
work which is wanted in return for these
blessings consists chiefly in lying around in the
sun. If the natives don’t appreciate the offer,
they are generally persuaded to come along bv
various other devices. Then the crowd is run
before the nearest J.P., who is in the same line
of business himself, and the kidnapper has the
gang “ consigned ” by legal process to his ser-
vice, to work for three years at so many hours
a day as their employer thinks best, in return
for certain vague and undefined rations and
some clothing not distinctly specified. The
rations consist of all the dead animals that are
too diseased or too dead for a white man to eat,
and all the flour that is too mouldy and too full
of weevils for ordinary consumption, together
with the contents of the garbage-keg in general.
And, as for the clothes, the nigger who works
In the fields and does not therefore come in full
view of the drawing-room window, gets a calico
ocGa.sioiially and a hat—nothing more.
When the shirt gives out, then ho has only the
hat and when the hat gives out then he has
nothing at all. The date when the new
shirt and the new hat become clue is uncertain
but it is generally about nine months after
the last vestiges of the old ones have vanished
off the lace of the earth. Now and then the
u.gger grows weary of this system of hard
labour and nakedness, and bolts for his old
haunts m the bush. Then the State sends out
a foice of police and black trackers, and runs
him down, or if he can’t he found/they
down some other nigger instead—for thov never
under any circumstances, come back without
a dh/ heathen, or one that will do as well-,
and he is gaoled at the expense of the rountrv
for -deserting his lawfuf employment™S
hen he conies out of gaol is sent back to finish
Ins three-year term. When his throe years
xpires, lus proprietor generally goes rio-io
a ,ca.l and takea « aoticAof U.o
It IS a wonderfully cheap system—at least ton
times cheaper than even the cheap Kanaka
scheme of bAMCEL Griffith, for there are no
labour vessels to hire, no Government Agent
no premiums to pay, no idiotic expense throuill
bis U tor ® to hIS home at the end of
bis tcun, for lus term is practically endless
and be is never returned in any case, no limita-
tion as to working hours, and the cost of rations
is reduced to a minimum. The squatter simply
goes out and catches his own cheap laboured
ami the expense ends right there. 1

A Christian Land-Grab.
“ General” Booth, the philanthropist whose
beak giveth lam away, is gradually dropping
1 a P° st « hc character. The three-ball tom
dencies of his nature which he tried so hard to
smother while the Salvation Army was in its
infancy and the funds were still insecure, are
becoming more and more prominent, and there
is an undisguised, hard grabbing after the pro-
will UI W- S i lat f r m , e . thods which doesn’t look

explained by the cable, as follows :

Tins is good. When Booth “ retains the power
of a landlord over that 500,000-acre block
winch he is snuffling after so energetically, it
simply means that the said block will belong to
him. He will pay nothing for it. It will he
cut up into allotments of 20 acres or so, and
planted with about 20,000 miserable Salva-
tionists of the humble, broken-hearted type—
those whose poverty and feebleness and ignor-
ance are a guarantee of their servile obedience,
ihey will he sweated and rack-rented by
Booth, who will let out the land at a little
elow British rates. He will either use
the rents for the purposes of the Array
or else keep them, and be the richest

that hig-druin Paradise, for Booth is to “con-

them is to plant them down as monthly tenants,
so that any individual who isn’t sufficiently
abject in his obedience can he fired out into a
cold world with his wife and family at thirty
days notice and his improvements confis-
cated Booth will nominate the munici-
pal authorities of the Salvation townships, and
the county councils ; and when they are elected
they will do what he tells them-or he ejected
from their holdings. He will also nominate
tac members of Parliament for the district, and
will see that they get in, and that they do
exactly what he tells them when they arc in
IBs scheme hi fact, is exactly that of the
absentee landlord of Kerry or Galway, with the
additional horror that he will boss the religion
of his tenants as well as all their other concerns •
and if it is once fairly started it will have to’
end in Booth being shot, after the Irish fashion
tor it will be absolutely impossible to remove
him by any other means.

That red-headed lickspittle, Kinnaird Rose,
is the subject of the following cablegram, which
by way of gratuitous insult, is entitled “ An
ex-Queenslander’s Views
Mr. W. Kinnaird Rose, lately editor of Brisbane
Courier, and now in England, has sent to every member
of the House of Commons a long letter on the Kanaka
question He says that it is impossible to mZ a word
against the traffic since the year 1886. The charges of
outrages committed by whites upon Kanaka women are
a wicked slander, and he quotes the testimony
of the Rev. Alexander Smith as to the kind treatment of
Kanakas in Queensland, Mr. Rose attributes the on»r.
silion to the traffic to the wirepulling of the new Union wto!
Kinnaird Rose came out to Australia some
years ago, and got his start in life by writing in


an Australian magazine, an abject puff which set
forth, in effect, that Griffith was a trifle
better than God, and far superior to the twelve
apostles. Then Griffith paid him for it
with a profitable billet on the Kanaka Com-
mission, and he knew it would please
Griffith — Rose voted that the Kanaka trade
was the most utterly and incurably vile
thing upon the face of the earth. Now —he
knows it will please Griffith, and perhaps he
has an eye on another profitable appointment
when he returns to Australia—he announces
that the same trade is absolutely without
spot or blemish. Also, he somehow gets
himself described as an “ ex-Queenslander,”
which is a libel upon Australia, and a reflection
upon the sense of the S.M. Herald, seeing that
Rose is just as much an ex-Queenslander
because he was once in Queensland as he would
be an ex-horse if he had once been in a stable or
an ex-Chow if he had once been in Canton.
Still he doubtless passes at “ Home ” as a sort
of “ representative Australian,” and his words
will carry weight accordingly among those who
do not know that the voice is the voice of
Samuel Griffith, though the long red beard
is the hair of Kinnaird Rose. Australia has
many burdens, but the “ returned kawlinist ”
—who has been three or four years in this
island —is about the heaviest of the lot.
Of late years a new horror has been added on
top of the old horror of the Hebrew who lends
out the monish at five per cent.—per month.
This is the Hebrew who has no “monish” to
lend. This individual, simply because he has
nothing, advertises that he will advance any
sum whatsoever, on any kind of security, at the
shortest notice, and the interest is only six per
cent. —or something like that—per annum. He
docs his business chiefly through the country
papers, and the fly that walks most frequently
into his little parlour is the farmer who wants
to borrow on the security of his land
and stock. There is such a lavish muni-
ficence about the advertisement that the
applicant generally asks for £lOOO or more.
Then he is informed that there is just one small
preliminary —a “ valuation fee” of, say, per
shent must be paid in advance, to cover ex-
penses in valuing the shecurity, and then the
capitalist has no doubt whatever that he
will be in a position to lend the required
amount. The £25, or more, is immediately
forthcoming; a cheap Christian clerk at £2 a
week, or less, goes up on a second-class railway-
ticket and looks with an ignorant eye at the
aerty, and a day or two later the money-
sr announces with deep regret that he
can’t see his way to make the advance, owing
to &c., &c. Naturally, this kind of usurer
always prefers doing business with the bucolic
customer. He lives on valuation fees, and the
city man who wants to borrow on a bundle of
Bear-hill scrip doesn’t yield him any profit,
seeing that even a usurer can’t extract a fee
for surveying and travelling expenses when the
security is of a portable kind, and is dumped
down on the table in front of him. Moreover,
the city client is too near at hand, and can
always drop in at the office and smash things,
while the country person can’t. Only a very
resolute man will travel, say, 200 miles by a
slow train to mop up the office with a usurer,
and in this lies his chief security.

Dear Bulletin, —Why do the National Ass.,
and Epps who is the Ass. ’s profit, and the
benighted fat men of the New South Wales
Upper House, and the party that wants a vote
for thrift whoop so hideously about the horrors
that will arise when One-man-one-vote becomes
law in their province ? According to their
assertion, which is endorsed by the Argus and
the S. M. Herald, the abolition of the Property
Vote will practically bring down red revolution
upon the land, and there will be anarchy and
spoliation, and a general confiscation of wealth,
and perdition will break loose and stalk horribly
over the length and breadth of New South
Wales. Yet in South Australia the One-man-
one-vote principle has been law for many
years, and nothing of a bloodstained or revolu-
tionary nature lias happened yet. In that
peaceful land every sane citizen who is out of
gaol, and has reached the age of 21 years, and
been six months resident in the province, has
one vote and no more for the Legislative Assem-
bly elections. The members of both Houses are
paid ; the Upper House, like the Lower, is
elective ; no deposit is required from candidates;
and the Assembly elections all take place on
one day. Therefore, according to the dirge
of Epps’s Association, Labour ought to be
uppermost in South Australia, and the
brutal “agitator” should have long since
smothered capital, and extinguished enterprise,
and run amok generally. Yet somehow, despite
the.manhood suffrage policy and the rest, S.A,
is very like the other provinces of this con-
tinent. It is somewhat quieter, for Labour,
after all, doesn’t bellow nearly so loudly as
Capital when it gets into politics, but otherwise
there is no visible difference. The Legislature
has not been swamped by a frantic gathering of
bricklayers and other artizans. In the Council,
which contains 24 members, there are exactly
three representatives of Labour; in the Assembly,
which contains 54 members, there are two only.
The rest are lawyers, squatters, merchants, land-
owners, and miscellaneous capitalists who run
the show in the same old style which prevails
in other communities. The province, having
obtained manhood suffrage, is much less
revolutionary than those where the plural
vote still predominates, bub Epps’s Associa-
tion hasn’t sense enough to see it. It keeps
sitting on the safety valve, which can only end
in an explosion, whereas if it got off the steam
would blow off harmlessly, and no injury would
ensue. But then Epps and his Association
don’t know enough to get off.—Yours, &c.,
Citizen.
He Rev. J. Milne’s (N.S.W.) agitation in favour
of placing the drink-traffic, whether as regards
warehouses, hotels, or clubs, solely in the hands
of the State, and converting barmen and bar-
maids into Civil servants, Mr. Milne’s latent
idea seems to be that if the puffy young men
and limpid-eyed virgins who administer to
thirst were added to the Blue Book army, they
would cease to have any interest in making
customers drunk, and would, on the contrary,
be apt to let them know when they had had
enough. The Bulletin believes that things
would go on much the same as before the
reform. It is extremely rarely that bar-tenders
tout or tempt men to drink ; and, although
they frequently have occasion to refuse and
eject, it is not likely that they would aid the
cause of temperance by gratuitously admonish-
ing a toper who can keep command of his legs
and speech, even though it were evident that
he was working towards the hobnail-liver
goal. Moreover, the Government could not be
expected to take up the scheme with the inten-
tion at the outset of making it a failure. They
must regard purity as a “ long-felt want,” and
declare that a knowledge of the correct brand,
through the Butler-General, alone exalteth a
nation. They could not run the Blue Zion or
the Blazing Stump by the agency of a sour-
looking devotee, unless disaster were sought
for.
The latest snake yarn. A death-adder on
the Endeavour River bit the handle of an axe.
The wood swelled up to such an extent that it
burst the eye of the axe.
When you want a friend, don’t pick out
the man whose dog never wants to follow him.
The man that a dog won’t be seen with is a bad
lot. By the way, the worst insult we ever knew a
white man to sustain was when his stumpy-tailed
cattle-dog left him for good and took up with a
Chinaman.
Jackeroo sent to take up his quarters at
out-station, arrives with portmanteau strapped in
front of him and finds stockman skinning a
bullock on the plain. Jackeroo: “I am Mr. De
Vere, and have been sent out to live here. Where
is the hut ? ” Stockman: “ Over there.” Jackeroo :
“ But I don’t see it.” Stockman: “There, you
blanky fool —that caul-fat slung over the salt-
bush.”
In Tasmania. Proud Teuton, J.P., after
hearing the charge : “John Jones, I haf known
you one long time ; you can go to prison for dree
veeks.” “But, your Worship,” whispered the
clerk, “you must ask him whether he pleads
‘ guilty ’or ‘ not guilty ’ first.” “ Ferry veil,” said
his Worship. “How do you pleat; kilty or not
kilty?” “Not guilty, y’r Wasshup.” “Den I
give you dree veeks, and your mate can go mit
you. ”
The reduction by the N.S.W. Government
of alleged cattle-stealer Finn’s sentence, from ten
to five years, can hardly have pleased Mr. Justice
Windeyer, whose judgment, even in the Mount
Rennie case, has never yet been known to err.
By the time Minister O’Connor sees fit to let
young Suffield (now rotting in gaol for a crime
which he in all human probability did not com-
mit—if indeed it was ever committed at all) out
of prison, the Mount Rennie Judge will probably
feel in excellent humour with himself. The
admissions made with regard to the Suffield case
by the N.S.W. Minister of Justice render the
further detention of the prisoner utterly incom-
patible with the maintenance of public confidence
in the administration of the law.
Brother Anselrae, night-porter at the
Grande Chartreuse monastery, who died last year,
was a sort of (Edipus and Cephalus rolled into
one. On the death of his first wife, he married
her sister, and she dying childless, he espoused her
mother ( i.e ., his own mother-in-law) by whom ho
had a daughter. Probably he would have gone on
marrying the female members of the family until
the panel was exhausted, but for his ill-luck in
accidentally shooting his own daughter in mistake
for a hare, which so wrought on his feelings that
he withdrew from the world content thenceforth to
perform the humblest and dreariest of functions.
Apropos of these, a French paper says :
His was the delicate mission of discovering whether a
woman were not trying to sneak in male apparel into the
cloister, prohibited as it is to the tempting sex. For this
he had an infallible method. If he harboured the least
suspicion he would courteously ask the visitors to be
seated, and drop, as if by accident, some small article,
curious stone, or bit of wood-carving, while handing it
round for inspection. Men instinctively close their knees to
arrest a falling object; women on the contrary, through
the acquired habit of skirts, extend them. And in the
latter case Brother Anselme would cause the delinquents
to be conducted to the quarters reserved to the fair sex.
A ghastly thing happened in an Adelaide
suburb recently. Two business men were next-
door neighbours, and, as they did business together
in town, an intimacy sprang up between them.
The other morning, after Jones had gone to town,
his aged father came out on the verandah to enjoy
the sunshine, and, happening to look over the
little dividing fence, was surprised to see Smith
—a bachelor —standing on his doorstep, apparently
not intending to go to work that morning. The
old man was pretty well stone-deaf, although he pre-
tended that he could hear very well, and his sight
also was weak. He began talking to Smith about
the weather, business, the plants in his garden,
and all the topics old men will talk about; he
didn’t observe that Smith didn’t answer, or move
from his position on the doorstep, but rambled on
till his son came home to lunch. He, too, was
surprised to see Smith there, and came over to
ask what was the matter. Smith, he found, was
suspended by the neck from the roof of his veran-
dah : over-speculation-suicide. They never told
the old man he had been talking to a corpse, and,
as his sight was too dim to admit of his reading the
papers, he doesn’t know now.
That slobbersome person, Fitz-Gibbon
(Gibbon means “monkey ” and Fitz signifies “the
son of ”), of Melbourne, started out in grand style
to bring Australia into contempt and make this
nation a thing of loathing at the last Hopetoun
banquet. The fearful Gibbon was in good condi-
tion, and this was how he went on :
His Excellency the Governor, a gallant nobleman and
the worthy descendant of a long line of warriors by land
and sea, whose names were interwoven with the wars and
glories of the mother land for the last 200 years. . . A
noble who had inherited high dignity, and needing no
election to enable him to take his place in the most dis-
tinguished Legislative Chamber in the world. . . ,
There were friths beyond Forth, but beyond the Forth
there was no frith more lovely, and no palace more
magnificent than Hopetoun-house. There it was that His
Excellency the Governor was king, with stalwart retainers,
such as they had seen specimens of at Government House
—fine six-feet-six Scotchmen. There, too, the Governor,
if he had a taste for his national music, could have his
hundred nipers an’ a’ an’ a’; his hundred pipers an’ a’,
inimitably beyond all these, he had his fair wife, one of
the loveliest and the most amiable and the most gracious
ladies that England owned or Ireland ever gave birth to.
That this young man in the prime of life, with illimitable
pleasures around him, should consent to expatriate him-
self from home and to come out to the other side of the
world was the highest compliment that could be paid to
the public spirit, the patriotism, the.lqve of Queen and
country which swayed the young Conservative nobility of
England. There was no benevolent object or public work
tha”t His Excellency was not in his carriage, in the train, or
in the saddle—and a noble horseman he was-to attend
to, &c., &c.
“ Ain’t it sickenin’ ! ”
Jack Corrigan.*
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
“ It’s ny shout this time, boys, so come along and
breast the bar,
And kindly mention what you’re going to take;
I don’t feel extra thirsty, so I’ll sample that
‘ three star ’ —
Now, lad ! come, look alive, for goodness sake.”
So spake he, as he raised the brimming glass
towards the light ;
So spake “Long Jack,” the boldest moun-
taineer
Who ever down from Nungar raced a “ brumbie ”
mob in flight,
Or laid a stockwhip on a stubborn steer.
From Jindabyne to Providence along the Eucum-
bene
The kindest-hearted fellow to be found ;
And when he crossed the saddle not a horse was
ever seen
That could make Jack quit his hold to seek the
ground.
The women smiled with pleasure, the children
laughed aloud,
The very dogs came barking to his feet,
While outside the “Squatters’ Arms” the men
came forward in a crowd
To welcome Jack when lie rode up the street.
But though the boldest horseman who by mid-
night or by day
E’er held a mob of cattle on a camp,
There were squatters on Monaro, who had yet
been known to say
Jack was a most unmitigated scamp.
And true it is Jack Corrigan possessed a serious
fault
Which caused his gentle, blue-eyed wife much
grief,
And many were the bitter tears she mingled
with the salt
With which she cured their neighbours’ tend’rcst
beef.
And often would she tearful take her smiling
spouse to task,
Who’d answer, as her pretty face he kissed,
That a beast lost all identity when pickled in the
cask,
And a bullock more or less would ne’er be
missed.
But now as Jack stood all prepared to toss his
nobbier down,
A softly-murmured whisper met his ear—
“ I just saw Trooper Fraser get a warrant up the
town,
He’s after you, old man, you’d better clear !”
Jack never thanked the donor of this excellent
advice,
As the glass fell through his fingers with a crash.
With a bound across the footpath, he was mounted
in a trice
And speeding down the roadway like a flash,
While Trooper William Fraser wore a very gloomy
face,
As he watched his prey go flying down the road.
But he settled in the saddle and prepared to give
him chase,
As Jack struck out a line for his abode.
On the road toward the Show Ground, then, there
hung a big swing-gate,
Jack’s filly cleared its bars in glorious style,
But he held her well together, for he knew the
trooper’s weight
Would give him half a distance in each mile ;
For Jack rode twelve Stone fully, while Bill Fraser
rode but nine,
Sweetbriar’s strength must surely soon be spent,
Being grass-fed, while the trooper’s chestnut horse
could always dine
Off oats and barley to his heart’s content.
And all aloud Jack cursed the day he’d ever killed
a beast
Or branded calf he couldn’t call his own,
While the hoof-strokes on the road beat out a song
that never ceased
To echo in his ear with mocking tone :
“ Three years in gaol, in gaol three years,” the
jeering echoes sang;
The granite boulders caught the wild refrain.
“ A broken life, a weeping wife,” ’twas thus the
rhythm rang,
“ And a baby-boy you’ll never see again ”
He groaned, and then, to dull the sound, spoke
loudly to the mare,
And bade her never slacken in her speed.
“ For God’s sake take me home, lass, with little
time to spare;
Five minutes, at the most, is all I need—
Just time to catch old Dandy, where he’s munch-
ing second growth
Of hay, just time to leap upon his back,
And then the smartest “ trap ” who ever swore
a lying oath
Could never foot me down the River track ”
Sweetbriar pricked her ears, and shook a foam-
flake from her bit,
As she heard his words, and doubtless caught
their sense,
And the rotten granite pebbles rattled round her
as she lit
On the homeward side the Rosedale bound’ry
fence—
As they scrambled round by Lockers’-hill, Jack
Corrigan looked round,
And as ho looked was filled with stern delight.
For he saw the baldfaced chestnut struggling
fiercely on the ground,
Though the hill shut out the sequel from his
sight;
His triumph was but short, for, as he stemmed the
wide morass,
Where floods had muddied waters once so clear,
And left the giant tussocks tangled tightly in a
mass,
The trooper still kept drawing on his rear;
The Murrumbidgee’s icy stream was widened out
by flood ;
They swam it at the willow-shaded ford,
As they passed the station buildings his long spurs
were red with blood,
Sweetbriar’s heaving flanks were deeply scored.
Her stride grew more uneven, though she answered
every call,
No jockey rode a better race than Jack
As he eased her up the hills and pressed her on-
ward down the fall,
Round the sidlings of the Billylingra track.
They left O’Rourke’s behind them, where it fronts
the big bald hill,
At the Flat Rock Jack was riding all he knew—
With all the dash and judgment of the famed
Monaro skill,
Yet he couldn’t keep the trooper out of view;
He spied his tiny homestead as Bill Fraser gained
apace
And loudly warned the fugitive to yield,
Who turned half round but saw no sign of pity in
his face
As they swept across the cultivation field ;
Their hoofs’,dull thunder brought the wife in
wonder to the gate,
She waved her hand in answer to his shout;
While Dandy from his paddock whinnied loudly
to his mate,
To know what all the trouble was about.
“ God help us now—the end has come !” the
wretched woman cried,
And leant against the gate to catch her breath ;
While the tiny, blue-eyed toddler cheered his
father on his ride
Toward the ghastly winning-post of Death.
“The filly’s failing fast,” thought Jack, “she’s
nothing but a weed,
It’s a certainty she can’t keep long in front.
I’ll make a splendid target, if he likes to draw a
bead,
As I try to cross the river on the punt.”
He left the mare and scrambled through the ti-trco
growing rank,
Deep rooted in its bed of yellow clay,
But when he reached the river, stood and trembled
on the bank
“My God!” he hoarsely said, “it’s swept away!’’
The punt was gone, the rope of wire still stretched
from shore to shore,
Jack paused but half a moment to decide,
And as he scrambled down the bank the wond’ring
trooper saw
Him struggling half across the rushing tide,
The angry waters swept him down, and every
nerve was strained
To keep his hold upon the frail support,
Though icy numbness seized him yet his courage
never waned,
The hope of freedom filled his every thought.
The rope sway’d low beneath his weight and
bellied to the stream,
Around his head the flying ripples curled,
While high above the river’s roar rang out the
awful scream
Of a soul that flies in terror from the world.
A mighty log, borne swiftly on the bosom of the
flood,
Resistless swept him ’neath the eager wave,
And sucked him down to river depths, and there
beneath the foam,
Jack Corrigan sought out a nameless grave—
“ Good-bye to life, good-bye to life,” the mocking
wavelets sang,
The towering cliffs took up the wild refrain,
“ A broken life, a weeping wife,” ’twas thus the
rhythm rang,
“ And a baby boy he’ll never see again. ”

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
In ’77 I was canoeing on the Wanganui,
and stopped at Tawhitinui for some shooting.
“Kere,” a canoeman, pointed out to me the little
island of Moutoa, which lay below us, showing up
sharp and distinct aerainst the white tumult of
the rapids on either side. “ You know ’bout fight
there, boss?” queried Kere, referring to the battle
somewhere in the sixties between the Hauhaus
and the Wanganuis. I replied affirmatively, when
Kere said : “Me make a fight there, too—plenty
gun, plenty tomahawk, Kapai!” Further inquiry
elicited the fact that he had been there and carried
two reminders of the fight in the shape of bullet-
wounds, both, I regret to say, in the rear. Kere
proceeded : “I see dam queer thing there, boss.”
“ Well, tell us, then,” said I, and in the course of
about half-an-hour I managed to dig this yarn out
of him piecemeal.
# # #
The Maori religious fanatics, or Hauhaus,
who were menacing New Plymouth, discovered
that the bulk of the troops had been withdrawn
from Wanganui for the defence of the former
place, so concluded to drop down the river and
attack Wanganui. This they would have done
but for the fact that the Ranana natives wouldn’t
let them pass, and by arrangement a battle was
fought on the Island of Moutoa, which resulted
in the total defeat (after several narrow squeaks)
of the Hauhaus.
# « •
Several years previously a young Maori
had come down to Ranana from Taumaranui, up
the river, and finding the wahines much to his
taste had settled there, becoming practically one
of the tribe. Naturally he went out with the rest
to fight, but to his consternation saw his father in
the front rank of the enemy. This rather flabber-
gasted him, for, says he, “We are going to win,
therefore my father will be killed.” Next he
thought—“lf any of these Ranana jokers kill my
old man they will jeer the life out of me, and I
can’t stand that, so I suppose I must kill him my-
self and keep the honor in the family.” He
thereupon challenged his parent and scientifically
laid him out, and then went upon the warpath in
a manner terrible to see. The battle won, ho
returned to the corpse of his father, and singing a
death-song partly apologetic to his parent and
partly eulogistic of himself in that he had saved
Ids old man from the disgrace of death at the
hands of an enemy, he blew out his own brains.

Castlemaine Fire Brigade turned out las
week, to put out the Aurora Australis.
Advt, from an English paper : —
"TTTANTED a humble country woman, age about 50,
’ ' to do the house work in a gentleman’s family ;
must be sober, industrious, and strictly honest.
Wages, £4 a year.
If the <£4 a year didn’t make her humble, what
would ?
The Bishop of Exeter (Eng.), who some
time ago raised a controversy by confirming sundry
idiots in a local asylum, defends his position by
the statement that “those who are weak in in-
tellect lean very much more strongly to religion
than others.” The Bulletin rises to declare with
one voice that they do. Religion of the Bishop’s
church variety is just the sort of thing that a
person of weak intellect does lean to, and the
weaker he is the more he leans. Sometimes ho
leans so much as to become a bishop.
The other day an old man turned up in an
English police-court to ask the magistrate’s advice
about a delicate point. His daughter, he said,
married a soldier, and her husband deserted her.
Then she married again, and after that the soldier
came back. He didn’t object to the second mar-
riage, but, feeling that he hadn’t done the square
thing by the family, he offered to make honour-
able amends by marrying any other member
of it who was disengaged. His wife’s aunt
accepted the offer, but her previous husband wasn't
dead, and, under these circumstances, the old man
wanted to,know how they ought to proceed. And
when the magistrate told him that there was one
bigamist in the family already and two more on
the road, and that they would all three be liable
to penal servitude, he walked out in a swooning
condition and was too surprised to speak. Seem-
ingly education is sadly neglected in England even
yet.

810 Macqunrie-strcet North, Sydney, Janol, 1892,
My Dbau Mookabinda, —
The first day of the postponed-Birthday meeting ( en
parenthi.se B rthday is a misfit title, there are so few
happy returns about racing) at Randwick, on Thursday,
naturally saw an off-day attendance, and you hadn’t to
coax somebody to sit in j our place while you promenaded
at any stage of the proceedings. But the Governor’s box
was simply overflowing with hereditary titles. Lord
Jersey, in a hat shaped like the one Marius is wearing at
the Royal, had Lord Glasgow (a tall, old gentleman, with
white ha : r and an iceberg eye) to amuse all day, and Lady
Jersey was explaining things to Lady Glasgow. That lady
wore an old rose-coloured cloth with a brownish mottle, the
bell-skirt outlined up the seams with brown gimp, which
also appeared round the edge of the brown velvet yoke ;
scarf of old rose chiffon round the neck, and a tiny capote
bonnet in brown and old rose, with an artificial flower
standing up in a stiff, surprised sort of wav from the back
bow—emblematical, I think, of Lady Glasgow ’s probable
mental attitude during her stay in Australia. Lady
Jersey, judged by her outer husk, evidently connects
dresses with occasions as an actress wears the same
frocks in the same plays—so she wore the brown and blue
shot-silk, covered all over with black Tosca net, that she
sported at the autumn meeting. Miss Everett—niece to
Lady Glasgow—was one of the Governor’s party, and wore
a cold and fish-like combination of grey and white: and
a couple of aides, one of whom had as many brass buttons
on his weskit as Fred Mason’s costermonger, completed
the Glasgow suite on this occasion.
The most fashionable wrap at the races was Miss Nellie
Hill’s black coaching coat with Watteau pleat behind, and
double-breasted front; though I can’t say it was as
becoming as well -what is the use of bundling up a good
figure in something the cut of a flour bag? Such slops
are the only hope of the woman who might be mistaken
in the distance for a clothes peg.- Mrs. Forbes Angus
wore a handsome dress the colour of brandy sauce and
trimmed with velvet to correspond, and Miss Carrie Swain
was in fawnish cloth and velvet with front of brown
bengaline; Misi Hogg, from Victoria, wore dark-blue
flecked tweed with white vest, with pale-blue chow check,
dark-blue felt hat with pink velvet bows and fawn wings ;
pretty,Miss Burdekiu (who is not going to be married
after all—at least, not just yet, nor to the bridegroom
attributed to her) contrasted black diagonal stripe serge
and eau-de-nil silk very successfully; Miss Amy Roberts
appeared in snuff colour tweed trimmed with furen suite ;
MisS Pilcher in pale French grey and silver rather spoilt
it by an exceedingly top-heavy hat. No lady should go
around with an entire ostrich on her little head.
Several marvels of millinery were on view on the Grand'
Stand, and excepting a woman in red and yellow tartan
trimmed with fur and a green ’at ,1 know she pronounced
it ’at) who would have made a sensation as a bookmaker
in the St. Leger, where the hue of the metallician’s plush
coat makes the horses swerve, there was nothing much to
glare at. Mrs. Art-hur Allen wore a mysterious garment
in ink-blue covered with black-striped grenadine, the
front of moonshine-blue silk with deep pleated belt
beaded in gold and silver, flat black hat and feathers;
Miss Burdekin, in dark-blue cloth with tartan silk sleeves
and basque frill, black feathered hat, had Miss Bloom-
field with her in a dowagerish frock of black silk and
velvet and a bunch of violets in a small black toque ; Miss
Simson had a mannish dress of brownish cheviot, brown
felt hat trimmed with velvet and feathers; Miss Carrie
Swain wore a black cloth gown en princesse, edged with
brown beaver and fastening over on to the right hip with
a jet buckle, plateau hat in red velvet and black quills ;
Mrs. (Mayoress) Manning wore mulberry and black narrow
striped silk, the trained skirt buttoned up the left side,
small bonnet en suite ; Mrs. “ Tom” Slattery wore a dark
blue, tailor-made gown of perfect fit; and Miss Gowlland
(who came up on top of the Australian Club coach) looked
very well in dark green contrasted with light-green silk.
What I devoutly believe was the Countess of Glasgow’s
first appearance in an Australian theatre occurred at
Sydney Royal on Queen’s Birthnight, when Mrs. B. B.
was V.R., and the Maoriland Governor’s wife with Lady
Jersey (in green velvet and ivory satin designed in gold
braid, amber necklace) squired by the Earl of Ancrumand
a Glasgow camp-follower with no perceptible eyelashes and
mustard colour locks (can he be the aide whom rumour
said the girls would fall over one another to captivate?)
were roped off in the middle like prizes at a tennis-
contest. Judging by the direction of the opera-glasses
Lady Glasgow was the star of the evening. She seemed
to be a plump, matronly social oasis with straightfeaturcs,
a sun-burnt skin, dark hair and a pair of rather effective
• lark eyes. Also her airiest nothing was audible on the
confines of the d.c.—but that may be the effect of having
bad to make talk on the stormy billow when the merest
•monosyllable sounds like the howl of a lost soul. In
dressing Lady G. doesn't exactly promise to work the
Maori ladies up lo the pitch of putting tie-backs on their
grass petticoats, but her black silk and lace gown, diamond
brooch and twinkling star in the hair (arranged with a
fillet d la Grecque) grey Sucda gloves and painted fan
were effective.
‘‘The Country Girl,” at the Criterion (where the real
article isn’t often to be found, by the way, as she prefers
i lays with more shrieks and thuds in them than are
usually put up nowadays), is a pretty costume play, and
even though nearly all the characters wear the same
c lothes from the first to the finish it doesn’t necessarily
mean that they went to bed all standing, in the reign of
George the Something. Pattie B. is a winsome Peggy, and
fits everybody’s clothes like a glove whenever a disguise
11 necessary, but I like her best in her childish white
muslin, with yellow sash tied in fro..t. Her pert, sparrow
‘,ike aspect in the skirted coat and powdered wig is very
fetching; likewise llio pale-blue brocade and quilted
svcquc, in which 'the final gag is spoken, proved most
becoming to the country girl. Mrs. Molyneux was
Alithea, in a magnified edition of the frock men-
lioned above ; and I couldn’t help marvelling at the
supernatural neatness of Miss Temple’s Lucy. Miss
Temple appeared in the lever de rideau, “ My little Girl,”
and presented a very ingenuous appearance, in white
muslin and lace, but Miss T. should look after her stage
walk, which is as ginger as if she had filled her little
shoes with peas for penance, and forgot to boil ’em. The
house was full on the fourth night.
Tiie University Dramatic Society went at it again last
week with that hopeless insanity, “ Written in Sand,’’ a
tiling that self-respecting professionals never attempt,
but which amateurs cling to as a drowning man clutches
a straw—and with precisely the same results. The second
piece was Gilbert’s “ Palace of Truth,” in. which Miss 13.
Elliott—a young lady with a lawn-tennis walk and a way
of speaking like Emma Gwynne—was far and, away the
best actress there. It she had pitched her voice a little
more cleverly-as cleverly as she pitched herself into
Philimer’s arms in the last act-she would have deserved
every bun in the bag. But Miss Ackman, in white and
diamonds, spoke her lines most audibly and spiritedly of
all; Miss Whitfeld, though her get-up was Mary Ander-
son-ish and she made a pretty picture, might have been
pouring forth her stage soul in double Dutch. The he-
actors spoke well, but Mr. Davies, as the old King, was
badly got up as a youthful dude with rose-pink tights and
an auburn wig, so all his dialogue missed point. Mr.
Jones’ old man w r as a great success from his shoes to his
tarred teeth (to represent the gaps of age), and Mr. Win-
deyer’s Chrysal was the only stage courtier whoso trunks
didn’t wrinkle for lack of calf them out. Dressing
and mounting were quite professional, and the theatre
(Royal Standard) was almost filled with admiring friends.
Sydney, looked on like a plain and fancy-dress ball, got
loose on 25th ult., when the main thoroughfares were
dotted with male citizens in every sort of garment—
swallow-tail, uniform, ’varsity robes—all streaming
towards the Governor’s levee—which wasn’t very large,
by the way. Nothing distinctly awful happened, so lam
told, but rather an amusing thing was when the “Civil
Service ” (at levees, you know, the callers are sorted out-
side and put through in batches) was loudly bidden by
Jeames to enter the Presence, and one long-haired
suburban alderman jerked in alone as the representative
of the whole system ! The onlookers appreciated his
aplomb more keenly because one or two big guns (includ-
ing the Cardinal), on finding themselves, individually, the
only representatives of their announced societies, modestly
went in under somebody else’s banner instead. But
fancy only one civil servant at the levee ! Didn’t they
give the Lands Office time to put on its boiled and ironed
glory ?
Lad}' Jersey signalised Victoria Regina’s seventeenth
birthday, or so, by an “ at home,” on 25th ult., when the
vice-regal genius for cutting it short was more than
usually apparent. Arrivals at nine ; supper at ten ;
departures soon afterwards. It’s evident that visitors to
Government House needn’t worry about bringing their
latch-keys with them.
Which reminds me that professional musicians, bidden
to perform at Government House, contrast the' Carington
and Jersey regimes to the detriment of the latter. The
Caringtons were wont to hang round the performer as he
performed and to say (lovely humbugs, weren’t they?)
“ Be-yoo-tiful ! ” audibly when he paused for breath ; but
the Jerseys simply let him loose on the programme while
they are leading (be conversati in at the other end of the
room. Your musician can stand anything but a babel of
talk while he is at it, consequently there are regrets for
the time when pretty Lady C. said “hush,” and Signor
Tremolo shook his leonine hair out of his eyes amid a
silence that could be felt.
A certain Australian Governor, bad quite a blood-
curdling experience during a recent Northern trip. At a
very hole-and-corner sort of settlement, the village shanty
was the only place where the party could he housed, so
the better part of the grog-shop was given up to them
the Governor being lodged in stale in the landlord’s bed-
room. To signalise the V.R. visit a ball was given in an
adjacent humpy to which the publican’s wife repaired in
all her glory, leaving her two-year-old baby peacefully
asleep at the hotel. In the small hours, though, the
infant awoke, and not understanding the strange bed and
the absence of its mother, started out for the Governor’s
bedroom howling, and commenced to climb in beside Her
Gracious Majesty’s representative. Then the crying of
the child aroused a cockatoo, which uttered discordant
yells, and thoroughly awoke the Governor, who, feeling
something snuggling into his couch, shrieked for the
police.
About vice-regal accommodation when on the war-path
ondif-but I can only obscur.ly hint it, after all—that
up-country magnates don’t know exactly how many
rooms the Personage wants, especially when he brings his
wife along. Some have “ heer’d on the fashionable style,
in coorse,” but there are terrible blunders sometimes. If
a whisper behind one’s hand didn’t echo so in print I
could tell you such an amusing incident apropos !
Quite a little gathering of the sock and buskin fraternity
was observable with the naked eye at the last day on the
S.T.C., at Randwick, but, of course, Mrs. Bernaid Beere
got all the possibly admiring attention. But I can’t
honestly smile on that genius’ race toilet, though—a long,
cigar-brown, straight up-and-down ulster, with ear-high
collar, trimmed with white fur, ’nealh the hem of which
one detected more than was graceful of the lady’s heels,
birch-broom hair dressing, flattened by a wide brown hat,
covered with an untidy brown veil. When the lofty
Mrs. B. stood with her hands thrown into her front
pockets, and her feet rt la Colossus of Rhodes, in these
remarkable garments one didn’t exactly long for the
address of her couturifne. Isabel Urquhart had on a
cream silk skirt, flowered in pink, topped with a bright
green silk bodice, with guipure aggravations; feathers in
her hat, and the weak spot on her visage—the long,
wilful chin—adroitly softened by a coq’s feather boa. M.
Marius was there in church-deaconish raiment and tan
gloves; Pattie Browne strutted to and fro in black, with
a toque of black and amber, and Mrs. Molyneux wore
rough-grey cheviot, with quills in her hat.
On dit (in relation to a recent society match) that when
you skip by one boat calling yourself Mrs. X., and your
hu-band skips by another under the name of Mr. Z., and
then you join forces on board another ship still as Mrs. X.
and Mr. Z., but carry on as if you were Mr. and Mrs. Z.—
well, it makes people gaze over the lady's head,anyhow-
Devoted couples who flea separately should always
remember to make their visiting-cards tally when they
mcet. For token people see the supposed Mr#. X.’s liny
boots beside an alleged Mr. Z.’s long eights outside a
mutual nabin-door—well, what would you think?
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

leasing a villa for seven years and paying £2o0
down, so that he can securely murder his wife and
conceal her body ; then go back to America and
marry another. Sims, however, buries the victi n
under a pear-tree instead of under the hearth-

For years past if has been periodically stated
that somebody or some syndicate would re-open Iha
Tower Hill mine at Dalmorton, until it has been shrewdly
suspected that someone still interested in that dead con-
cern is distantly related to, or acquainted with, a news-
paper correspondent. The public are tired of being told
that many years ago some 2000ozs. of gold were taken
fiom some 2C03 tons from this mine. Ask those who paid
tlic piper for that thumping hard tunnel, and you will
bear quite a different story. It was, of course, a pity
that they did not finish the tunnel—it finished them
instead. Some day some wise men or fools will extend
tlie tunnel to the reef, and whether they are wise or fool-
ish will, of course, hang on the result.

At last something like gold has come out of the
Hem worth mine at Lucknow, N.S.W., an English com-
pany with a ponderous capital. Five tons returned
ISOOozs., a big thing if there happens to be much more of
the same sort left in the patch. Rich patch or nothing is
the characteristic of Lucknow. They follow the joint of
tw'o distinct strata between which rich gold in calcite and
nnspickle pyrites is occasionally found. Like angels’
visits these bonanzas are few and far between, and
i e ir ei M l6 "’ Mil ever he sufficiently numerous to return
the English shareholders their mone}' is too much of a
conundrum for anything but time to answ’er. However,
more money will probably lie made by the effect of
bonanzas than out of the gold they return. Opinions
fiom practical men concerning it are as wide as the poles.
Some say some day they will strike a ton of gold in a few
tons of rock ; others that it will take two tons of gold to
find it. Time and money alone will tell.
* * *
There is too much newspaper mining in N.S.W.
of which the following is a fair sample: “Pamhula
G.M. Co. One lot showed 3oz. stone.” Was this
the best or the worst? Again—“ Northern slope—some
samples carrying gold to 15ozs. per ton,” The public
being sick unto death of these old wheezes calmly await
the result of the first few hundred tons, and though
probably they will wait a long while it will be no gr--t
strain on their patience.
* * *
Again we are told that the Bear Hill battery
“is still working constantly and satisfactorily.” Now,
what does all this mean? If the reports are truthful
many thousands of tons of quartz must have been raised
containing quite as many thousands of ounces of gold.
Have they ever had a cleaning up, and, if so, what? If
not, the battery has been going long enough to have put
through 3000 tons. (Since the above was written, the
Rear Hill has cleaned up considerably - under an ounce to
the ton ; and a petition has been presented to the Mel-
bourne Law Courts for the winding up of the Co.)
* * *
A correspondent works off a little playful satire
concerning the New- Year’s Gift claim at Swamp Oak
(N.S.W.). He refers to a crushing of supposed seconds
winch yielded double that of alleged firsts. The writer
refers him to the last cheerful report of the mine—“ Have
another 10 tons to grass, will start crushing again shortly.
V\ ill not wait to get outgreat quantities. Busy raising as
much good stone as possible.” We have no doubt of it.
* # «
We thought as much. The prospectus of (he
Mount Stewart Extended Silver Mining Co. has been
issued. It is the same old story told in the same old way.
It is “next to,” and ihe same lode formation extends
right through the property. And there are reports from
persons connected with the Mt. Stewart, one or more Mt.
Stewart directors are on the hoard, and “ there is every
reason to believe” that ore like unto that of Mt. Stewart
will he found, hut that it hasn’t been found is probable
by the silence kept on the point. The reports are colour-
less, and indicative of nothing beyond a prospective value
and every mine under Heaven has that. The ghastly
truth appears to be that absolutely nothing of value has
been found on the properly- nothing whatever to warrant
a company being formed, under which the promoters take
half the capital in paid-up shares, besides iIOOO in cash.
# e «
The Gold Hill, in the district of Orange, has
cropped up again. This time to see what steps should he
taken to compel people to pay their calls. But as the
well-worked little game of the Orange “school” o|
mining-mummers in connection with that mine is too
painful to he forgotten by the innocent Sydney victims,
it is very doubtful whether confidence in the prospects of
the mine will ever he restored.
* * #
Tiio “ whirl of excitement ” lias passed over
Whipstick respecting which we have periodically heard of
town allotment “sensationally rich gold and silver
discoveries,” “great future before it,” &c., &c. The
latest is: “The field is now almost entirely deserted, the
mining community having cleared out for what they
consider more promising fields.” Because they did not
stop is all put down to the w rong class of persons who
came there.
• # •
Shale lias come into great demand. There is a
sure fortune in two feet of permanently good shale.
Worthless shale lias been found in hundreds of places in
N.S. Wales ; good lias been found in less than a dozen.
Listen not to the story that, although poor at die out-
crop, it will improve with depth. The best of shale is
usually found at the outcrop, and it often deteriorates
under great pressure. Tiic Joadja Creek Co., which for
many years put out enormous quantities of splendid
shale, has fallen off. Hartley h ale is improving. The
latter’s shares could he bought a little while ago for a few
pence. They have sold their output for the next two
years at a very profitable figure,
• # #
Bonanza Consols—that mine which the innocent
public of N.S.W. were weekly advised to buy at 125., and,
when they receded to Bs., to Hold as it was only the result
of the “ hears ’’-are now at a penny. They did buy and
they dnl hold, and by their losses some people must have
made a heap of money. To the remaining holders we
caii only tell the simple truth: the mine is at Broken Hill
with neither position nor prospects to recommend it. Of
course ‘it may strike Soinelhi 'g”—a remote contingency
applicable to pvery mine on earth. We once knew a man
who started to sink for diamonds and struck a patch of
potatoes.
* * *
A crushing of three tons at Mort’s Dock from
the Alpine-Pioneer mine returned over 370 z. of gold. The
claim is just across, the Southern border in Victoiia. Four
previous larger loc.ql crushings averaged lOozs. ; reef small
from one inch to four, hut remarkably true and opened
up in several shallow shafts extending over three or four
hundred feet and rCef gradually increasing in depth
giving promise of eventually filling the walls, which arc
ISin. apart. A ve'ry fair-looking mining gamble—accept-
ing the owners’ representations as correct.
Bell and Duvto,‘the Sydney escaped rogues,

At Sydney Criterion one night last week a
double bill was presented with gratifying results
.1 he curtain-raiser,” “My Little Girl,” a one-
act drama from the pen of Mr. Boucicault, is
eminently satisfactory. It has pabulum enough
in it to furnish forth a three-act tragedy, and
Messrs. Pettitt and Sims can subsist for a whole
twelvemonth, and unwind many melos., on a
quarter of that amount of mental food. It affords
moreover, a tremendous opportunity for the dis-
b. y °f much genuine acting on the part of Mr.
1 itheradge, whose Geoffrey Linford is decidedly
not the worst of the many admirable studies of
character that he has given the Australian public.
Mr. Bouoicault’s artist is a fair stamp of artist, as
stage artists go ; but a visit to any ordinary studio
would do him a lot of good in the way of “ points ”
and general business. That princess of all old-
lady parts, Miss Romer, appeared to decided
advantage as the sympathetic aunt, and every-
body who understood what genuinely good acting
meant was proportionately sorry that so clever an
actress had not a larger opportunity. Miss Emma
lemple has a charming little character to play,
it fits her like a glove. She is the “little
girl of the piece, and since witnessing her per-
formance of the part we are sorry—very —that we
are not ourself a guardian. The short-sighted
curate of Mr. Geo. Lash Gordon is a pearl of
great price, and he stumbles over stools and
things, and smashes up china, with a pertinacity
worthy a bigger gun of the ecclesiastical edifice,
* * m *
Wycherley’s “Country Girl” succeeded
Boucicaults “My Little Girl” with immense
eclat, and a great deal of many other varieties of
abstract nouns. The Criterion is especially great
on juvenile maidens at present time of asking, but
for our own part we prefer the damsel of the
Queen Anne period, with her breezy freshness and
her insouciant wit. Of course, the comedy, as
now produced, lacks all its original coarseness,
and, consequently, much of its original point. Old
English comedy with the suggestiveness eliminated
is like burnt spirit, pleasant enough to the palate,
but inadequate as a corpse-reviver. Miss Pattie
Browne is, necessarily, a rustic gem of purest ray
serene in the character of Peggy, the country girl.
In this part, eclipse, in the graphic language of
Beaconsfield, is firet, and the rest an undertaker’s
procession ! She misses not a single point, she is
as natural as a spring zephyr, and the music of
the woodland rings through her voice like the
hunter’s halloo through an upland copse. In point
of merit, as regards truth to the spirit of Wycher-
ley’s century, Mr. Greenaway’s Harcourt takes a
distinct next place. lie is courtly, gallant, and
quite “old style.” lie can wear the costume
of the period as if born in it, and
Ins fustian compliments sound Chcsterfieldianly
sincere - at least as sincere as the 1 larcourts
of a past day could make them. Moreover,
he can manipulate the long dandy’s stick of
a Georgian age as if it were not precisely a clothes-
prop and this is a great point in old English
comedy. Mr. Boucicault was somewhat modernish
in the part of Belleville, and Mr. Lyndal in the
P ar t of Sparkish was decidedly gushy, of the nine-
teenth century brand of gush, until the last act,
when ho awakened to a sense of his responsibilities
and ran the drunken gallant through with a
suggestion of artistic finish. Mrs. Molynenx was
Alitiiea, but it is a thankless, albeit well-attired,
part, and all her many admirers were - sorry
to see her so badly placed. As Lucy, Miss
Temple acted with more spirit and vim than
one would naturally expect from an actress whoso
methods are usually so quiet and subdued. One
other character was admirably enacted—that of
Moody, by Mr. Lawrence, a clean, finished and
genuine piece of natural acting; but, as nobody
expects anything from him but finished work, the
remark is superfluous. The scenery by Messrs.
Spoug and Churchward is not the least among the
attractions of the present productions, and every
lover of comedy will be sorry when B. and B.’s
lease of the Criterion falls in—unless, peradven-
turo, they renew it in good season.

At Sydney Royal Mrs. Bernard Beere
continues to hold a modern looking-glass up to the
insincerities of drawing-room melodrama, and she
dies nightly with great success in a flood of
crimson-tinted limelight to the great distress of
a titled detective of Russian birth who speaks
very decent English with a decidedly French
accent, but whose acquaintance with the Newgate
Calendar passeth the wisdom of the serpent. The
weather has lately been anything but propitious,
yet “As in a Looking Glass” has drawn very
good houses, and a fair proportion of Mr. George
Gordon’s admirers do nightly congregate to make
remarks anent the new “drop,” and lay wagers as
to its whereabouts in Sydney Harbour. However,
the “ Looking Glass ” has to give place to “ Masks
and Faces,” and the Lena Despard of Mrs. Beere,
the detective of M. Marius, and the card-sharper
of Mr. Standing will be numbered among the
artistic memories of a gladsome past.

“ Little Jack Sheppard,” at Sydney Her
Majesty’s, boom de-ays along. The immortal
Royce has been retained for “yet another gaudy
week,” and the fin-de-siecJe can can, and the
weird skirt dances, have reached the zenith of
pedal accomplishment. Miss Billee Barlow has
wrought her “Jack Sheppard ” tip to a high point
of excellence, possibly rather in the music-hall
direction, but still highly acceptable to the
Sydney playgoer. During the week, Miss Barlow
has broken out in print, and wreaks a deal of
artistic criticism on the head of Mr. George Mus-
grovo for making unkind and uncalled-for remarks
concerning English provincial pantomime, the
scenery thereof, and the costumes likewise. Miss
Barlow indignantly remarks that she has pro-
vincially pantomimed with no little success ; that
she has worn the costumes with a grace peculiar
only to .herself; and that the scenery is good—
good enough, indeed, to put behind Miss Billee
Barlow ! Moreover, with calm, withering sar-
casm, the bright little lady caustically remarks
that she has noted said costumes and above-men-
tioned scenery, used previously in English provin-
cial pantomime, on the gilded stages of swell
Australian theatres. There now !

with “Ovid’s Art of Love” and was cruelly

Brisbane shows this week consist chiefly
of “Dorothy,” with Dorothy, or rather, Elton
left out, and Charlie Taylor’s crowd at the Gaiety.
The latter company was to have given a benefit
performance in aid of the Trades’ Hall building
fund. The Musical Union is sucking the cheerless
voice-lozenge in a wild endeavour to get up to
concert pitch, in anticipation of a few rounds with
Larry Foli and “ The Creation.”

Walter Bentley, whose portrait appears in
this issue, commences a season at Sydney Garrick
on 4th. June, his first appearance being as Hamlet.
Mr. Bentley when very young made the mistake
of selecting a Caledonian parson for a parent, but
he has successfully lived down this disadvantage.
Pie started life as a midshipman in the White
Star line, and commenced his theatrical career as
an amateur actor in Maoriland in 1870. After
travelling Australia in various capacities for
four years, he then went “Home” where
he obtained an engagement at the Court
Theatre, London. He afterwards pervaded
Scotland for a season as Othello, lago, Shy-
lock, Claude Melnotte, Richelieu, Macbeth,
Hamlet, and in various other characters. Then he
joined Irving’s company at the Lyceum, and
appeared in 1876 as De Noailles in Tennyson’s
drama “ Queen Mary,” as Laertes, Clarence
in “Richard III.,” Tristan I’Hermit, the historical
hangman in “ Louis X 1.,” Christian in The
Bells,” and other characters. He also appeared at
Sadler’s Wells as Rob Roy, and had a long run m
the United States as Wilfred Denver in the
“ Silver King.” He next toured England as lead-
ing man of Ristori’s company, and since then he
has been known throughout the United Kingdom
as a star of considerable magnitude, and the parts
he has played, and the successes he has made, and
the gate-money which he has realised are too
numerous to mention.

The real “Faust”—the poem of an in-
spired German translated into music by an
inspired Frenchman —was produced at Melbourne
Princess’s, on Saturday, in a style quite phenom-
enal at the price. Although far from being the
best vocal performance of the company, especially
in regard to the name character and chorus,
“ Faust,” taken in the lump, is a large subject for
admiration. The lighting of Satan is a work of
art. He glows like a burning coal amidst the
gloom, and gives such an air of reality to the spec-
tacle as one doesn’t usually look for in Italian
opera. The careful attention bestowed upon the
Devil is characteristic of the staging throughout,
and although many people had to hurry away on
Saturday without waiting for curtain-fall at 11.30,
the apotheosis of Marguerite came off with much
eclat nevertheless. Long intervals and a tendency
to drag some of the music accounted for the late-
ness of this conclusion. The poor, dear gnls
chastened spirit is now being fetched at 11
sharp, an arrangement which no doubt gives
pleasure to all, from the angel downwards.
Signora Cuttica’s voice is rather light for
some of the heavy work required of it,
but that plump and pleasing lady sings away
like a canary all the time, and her acting is as
true and sweet as her song. Signor C., on the
other hand, gets so steadily hoarser that he can
scarcely hold out much longer, unless they provide
an alternative tenor. Oavalleri’s Siebel is an even
more strapping young man than she was at the
time of her first visit to Melbourne, and otherwise
as satisfactory as ever. Travaglijii and Melossi
were the Mephisto and Valentine on Saturday.
The former fairly divided chief honours with the
prima donna, whilst the burly baritone galloped
home a satisfactory third. lorio and Sisco will
give the pair of them a rest this (Thursday) even-
ing. Another last night of “Jo ” may probably
occur on Friday, and whether “Rigoletto_ will
be wanted on Saturday depends circum-
stances. Anyway, on Wednesday, and Friday of
next week, the operatic strain upop the company
will be relieved by “grand vocal, instrumental,
orchestral ” concerts, with Maffezzoli in command.
** * *
At the Bijou there is another change of
bill. The first act of “Gloriana” had proved a
heavier burden than the other two acts could
carry, they themselves being quite spineless and
broken down in both legs. James Mortimer, of
Figaro, the dullest creature that ever dabbled in
stage-work, gave the English version of Gloriana
to the world, and this half of the world will not
readily overlook the insult. Fortunately, it was
hurled at limited audiences, and hurt but tew
feelings. “ Barbara ” and “ A Pair of Spectacles,
a pretty little brace of revivals, attracted a big
audience on Saturday, when the Melbourne com-
positors had a special night in the amphitheatre.
“ Barbara ”* acquired new and topical interest
from the fact that a thunderstorm clattered down
the roof whilst Mrs. Brough was describing a
storm at sea. “ A Pair of Spectacles ”is always
acceptable for the sake of its witty dialogue ami
playful satire, albeit Grundy’s experiment Of intro-
ducing a serious purpose into a farcical comedy is
not likely to find many imitators. Robert Brough
lias improved upon his original conception or Mr.
Goldfinch, which was very good in the first
instance, and Mr. Fabert plays uncle Gregory
like a sound comedian. “iNcw Lamps for Old,
by Jerome K. Jerome, will be coming along
shortly.
* * *
“ Faust Up to Date ” does a brisk business
at Melbourne Opera House, the floor being gener-
ally crowded, and the circles not much ott.
The female form divine is lavishly displayed in
each of the three scenes that illustrate this story,
and the rival merits of several pairs of logs are
warmly discussed during the interval. Another
redeeming circumstance in the entertainment is
its moral, happy conclusion. Ihe burlesque
Margaret, knowing how to take care of herself,
rings a handbell for Martha whenever the inten-
tions of her chap appear dubious, and although
matters certainly get a bit mixed in the moon i
garden it subsequently transpires that Jiaust
married the damsel by special license. thus the
Devil is put to confusion at last, whilst his young
friends go climbing up the golden staus in a
balloon. But perhaps this is not exactly what
happens. Nothing seems to happen for certain in
a burlesque, except legs and limelight. Lonnen
has slightly exaggerated his conception ot batan
with improved results, also the ladies are letting
themselves go more than they did. in whicn
respect Alice Leamar continues to lead the way
and give it ’em straight from the shoulder.

“ A Sailor’s Knot ” has struck bad times
at the Royal, so instead of running this handsomely
set up drama for a month (and times were when
it might have boomed for six weeks) Bland Holt
will withdraw the British tar from circulation
after Friday. Oil Saturday he gives them
“Master and Man” which is almost as good as
new to Melbourne. Those who remember Beelze-
bub and the fiery furnace will be glad to renew
the acquaintance, and those who have not yet
witnessed that remarkable dog and the scene at
the bakery aforesaid, are cordially advised to
seize the joyful opportunity by the forelock.

WALTER BENTLEY.
At the Alexandra an effectively-mounted
performance of “Devil’s Luck'’ took place on
Saturday, but the luck of the management was
evidently out. Nor was there anything about
this particular reminder of fifteen other stories
with a villain in them calculated to encourage the
hope that it will grow upon the public and ad vance
in popular favour by leaps and bounds. Anew
Irish drama is in preparation however, and if it
is sufficiently new and vigorously Irish, this treat
in store should fetch the multitude once again.

Of sundry other shows the little circus in
Swanston-street seems to flourish most persistently.
The Fitzgeralds’ pitched their tent with the idea
of stopping a month, and now they think of
stopping all the winter. Rotunda Concerts are
looking up a little, but Fob’s first appearance at
the Town Hall was made before an audience
which consisted mainly of Lord Hopetoun and
bare benches. Good music is cheap m Melbourne
iust now and Fob’s show has no real pretentions
to fill a Town Hall under the circumstances.

. Maonland yarn re poor Majeroni.. The| and
minora were staving at the Onteiion Hotel, JNapic ,
when they told the boniface they yearned to interview a
Maori chief—one of the real old cannibal school, unspoilt
bv knowledge of English ways. The host presently intro-
duced Willie Broughton, a popular half-caste, owner of
sheep-runs and racehorses, and a party to the Broughton-
Donnelly will-suit before the Privy Council, and persuaded
him to be an ancient anthropophagist for the ,"™ ce ' A
friend was procured to act as interpreter and the pan
were taken up to the sitting-room where the Signor and
Signora awaited their coming. Tlieinterpretertuined
out to be an old acquaintance of Majeroni s, and attei
several questions had been put through him to the noble
savage and duly answered in primitive Maori, he forgot
about the savage and began talking of the season just con-
cluding? The “chief” gradually became more and more
fid-etty as he felt himself out of it, and the conversation
rattling on the “ interpreter” complimented the Signora
on her appearance as “Marie Antoinette.”, “Marie
Antoinette !” burst in the “untamed savage in perfect

London D.T. thus welcomes back the Achurch and
Clmringlon:-“ Whatever charm the play possessed
apart-from its ethics, was its simplicity and nntuie. > t
a tour round the world has brought back the Dolls
House' disfigured with meretricious paint. Everything
is forced, strained, and unnatural that was before con-
vincing by means of its truthful method. Nora has
become, not a restle s but an attitudinising doll, and
Torvald becomes ridiculous under the forced strain of
melodrama. This is no new experience when simple
methods are exposed to the rough-and-tumble of unre-
fined criticism. Before now the best comedy companies
have left London complete and admirable, and returned
from the country loud and boisterous. Miss Jane Achuich
and Mr. Charles'Charrington forget what they were when
they left London. They have come home, but they are
not yet acclimatised. We can quite understand how the
simplicity of their method and their delicate art has been
knocked out of them. The theatres they have visited
would not understand it, so gradually they have raised
their voices, exaggerated their effects, and destroyed
their excellent method. They have come home, and they
must remember what we have never forgotten. We are
precisely the same: it is they who are wholly different.
‘The Doll’s House’as originally performed was a model
of good acting; it is now an unworthy specimen ot
English art. We are certain that the players are not
aware of the difference between then and now. They
have travelled far; we have remained at home. They
have been compelled to play down to rough audiences,
and to over-colour every scene in order to make them
effective. We are, so far as our tastes and judgment aie
concerned, the same as when ‘The Doll’s House was
first performed and first delighted everybody by its sim-
plicity and truth. To gain converts to Ibsemsm will be
impossible unless the present company can persuade
themselves or be persuaded that they are ruining then
own cause by a style of art that is as unusual as it is
Musgrove has arrived at Melbourne, in bad humour, in
34 days. Rumours of a join again with J.C.vv. Muzzy
has been contemplating the London half-guinea stalls,
and altogether echoes what Williamson said lately, that
Australian catering becomes ruinous However, Irving
and Ellen Terry are possible, and Edward Teny and
Wilson Barrett nearly certs. By the way, Musgrove
doesn’t tell us why the London people contemplate trips
to Australia, because business is so bad there, iliey play

Janet Achurch, interviewed in London, makes the most
of her Queensland gubernatorial and Jersey episodes.
She liked Auckland best, the City of Flowers, the
Florence of the South, where they pitched 300 bouquets
on the stage, for her farewell.
Miss Ellen Rowe, a well-known Melbourne amateur is
studying under Marches! in Paris. She has a splendid
contralto, and is at present devoting herself to the study
of oratorio. She was recently invited to singat HyCies
hv the Soci6t(S de la Croix Rouge, and acquitted heiself
admirably, was immensely applauded, and received quite
an ovation. Miss Devlin, a niece of Mrs. Malleson, also a
pupil of Marches!, sang at the same concert, and was
likewise a great success. The French Government gav e
the party passes to Hyferes and back. The Duke of Con-
naught took all the front seats at the concert, but none
of the royalties were present, the family being still 111
mourning.
Frances Saville has made great progress in her musical
studies of late, and has made two or three most successful
appearances in semi-public for Parisian charitable objects.
Critics predict for her a brilliant career.

Dear Bulletin', —“ Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay ” may not hav e

Courtneidge, in “Faust Up to Date,” is simply Elton's

Katie Barry, in “ Faust Up to Date,” is no higher than

Who can bring the lump to the throat. Jennie,
And a laugh e’en while we weep.
Come when the times get bright, Jennie, &c.
You have wrought from the deathless page, Jennie,

And he’s helped to raise the stage, Jennie,
From much that is coarse and low ;
And he's touched the sordid heart, Jennie,

And there’s scarcely a grander part, Jennie,
Than your ragged and chivvied Jo.

There are now on the market five histories

John M‘Callum, of Melbourne, died the
other day, and the Argus published a very kindly
notice of its one-time commercial editor. A
singular coincidence connected with this death
was worth mentioning in the paragraph, but it
didn t get there. Things likely to catch the eye
of the general reader never get into the Argus,

Melbourne, and the two old gentlemen born

in Australia with Mrs. Bernard Beere’s com-

On account of the faultless lines of her figure as well
as the classic perfection of her face, Belle Umuhart was
much sought after by artists to pose. She never accepted

•f he .u ge ? tle Pixle y> of Argonaut, des-
cribes the dynamiting Anarchist as “ a demented
fanatic set on a hair-trigger
“The crime is new,” he says, “and should be con-
fronted with new legal terrors. There are few, we think
e en among those who shudder at the vivisection of dogs
and cats and frogs, who would feel anything hut a glow
of satisfaction at the thought of a convicted anarchist
being stretched on the operating-table a d made to S er4
a useful purpose before life departs. No matter how
111 a Y. °e learned from observation of the interior
workings of the lower animals, it is obvious that they can-
not yield anything like the amount of knowledge that
could be derived from the investigation of a breathing
human being, laid open by the scalpel down the whole
front, like the codfish of commerce. Let the Government
milnupHV l6^ 60 that i he cnme of dynamiting shall be
followed by the surrender of the malefactor to the vivisec-
tion,sts, and the anarchist will follow the dodo into the
innocuous pbhv,on of extinction. With vivisection con
fiontmg him, even the wildest, most revolutionary and
blood-thirsty Parisian would feel too much respect for his
viscera to have anything to do with high explosives as
they are related to social reform. Think, too, of the vast
possibilities opened up to surgical science by this sugges-
tion of ours. Alienists might investigate the obscure
V ra . ,n -concerning which they now know so
little. The brain lesions of the vivisected subjects would
throw much light upon dark places. Fancy a living
anarchist strapped to a surgical table, a portion of his
skuli sawn out with great care, so as not to cause death
and then the hram tenderly dissected by a lecturer before
a class of eager students. The idea is one which must
aiouse enthusiasm in even a non-surgical mind.
Vei> likely Mr, Pixley is here joking* in a
picturesque manner. But if lie isn’t, let him
consider that though in the States the noble white

kerosenes his clothes and then sets light to him’
the nigger is not deterred.

A CLEAR DESCRIPTION OF THIS MOST SUBTLE
ENEMY OF MODERN LIFE —WHAT PROMINENT
PROFESSOR PAYS.
A WELL-KNOWN professor connected with a lead-
' ■ colle ge, in conversation, recently made
*«< flowing wonderful assertions ;
i <Te 1S - nothing which has ever
been known in the history of the world that has
caused more real misery to men and women than
that simple and yet dangerous element called uric
• / hls dangerous substance gets into the
blood of men and women, and even children, even
before they suspect it, and the havoc that it works
is simply appalling. It causes rheumatism,
neuralgia, gout and pneumonia. It is the cause
of most colds and the actual source of nearly everv
case of grip. J J
11 Y °i U , as ir l)OW thl > dangerous acid gets into the
blood. v ery easily. The principal duty of the
and b rpK dde r a r e to ex P el uric acid from
the system. They fail to work very frequently
and, instead of being driven from the system this
poisonous uric acid goes into the blood. When
once m the blood it ferments, it poisons, it causes
de»th nbered d,seases and to ° often occasions
It must be plain, even to a novice, that the
only way m which to keep this acid out of the
blood is to keep the kidneys and bladder in a
strong, a healthy and a vigorous condition. This
!sthe whole problem in a nutshell, and the man
or woman who does this is invariably free from
uric acid and the infinite troubles which it causes
1 have never known of but one thing that will in
every case drive uric acid from the system, and
that is Warner s Safe Cure. It has been found by
the medical profession to be possessed of properties
unknown to any discovery of ancient or modern
tunes. I have known of women who have been
weak sallow, run down, of men who have been
debilitated and wholly unnerved, who are to-day
pictures of health and strength, and they know as
well as I do that the result is due to but one thing

is very prevalent is most true, but to permit it to

remain, is simply folly. 1

POLITICAL
POINTS
How the English elections, this year, will
move on the Republic !
Why does Deakin quarrel with his former
feeding-bottle, the Age?
The S.A. Labour-party hope to win 16
seats in the Assembly next April. They now own
five.
Of the five labour members of S.A. Par-
liament, two are typographers, one a sailor, and
one a working miner.
All three S.A Judges have held Ministerial
office; Mr. Boucaut was the Premier famous for
having introduced the “ broad and comprehensive
policy.”
People are asking whether Joseph Abbott’s
knighthood w. s clinched by his now historical
protest against “ the advance of republicanism in
Australia.”
It is alleged there is a majority in S.A.
Legislature favoring the continuation of the
Transcontinental railway to Port Darwin on the
land-grant system.
General Tulloch (Vic.) declares that when
the Indian crisis arrives, there will be another
Soudan contingent. Paid for out of Australian
public funds ? Never !
Cohen, the Radical head of an Adelaide
Discount Bank, is very ambitious of Ministerial
office, but some of the Oppositionists decline to
vote against the Government unless he be
boycotted.
Mr. Paddy Buckley, Attorney-General of
Maoriland, has been made a K.C.M.G. The
earth retches at the tread of the “ backbone-and-
spinal-marrow ” Milesian who has developed into
a political greaser.
S.A. Parliament contains three doctors
and seven lawyers. Of the former, two homoeo-
paths sit in the Council, and one allopath in the
Assembly. The Assembly includes five lawyers—
two in the Ministry.
Minister of Public Instruction Peacock,
to a recent Melbourne deputation : “I am sorry
to see that the ambition of our young men is too
often to enter Government billets.” And to enter
Governments, friend Jackdaw.
Dodd Clark says Premier Playford told
him that the Kanakas in Queensland were “ prac-
tically slaves.” Playford denies that he ever said
so. Who is lying? Clark, it must be remem-
bered, is the editor of a black-labour oi’gan.
Wheeler, the Vic. Minister of Railways,
talks very like a “ minister.” He finds fault with
Speight for his want of “penitence” and indis-
position to “show a proper spirit.” In other
words, Speight’s management was most unseemly
and lacking in humility and meekness.
The S.A. Ministry only gives room for six
persons, but if the Opposition should carry a vote
of no-confidence next month Messrs. Holden,
Cockbufn, Grainger, Gordon, Cohen, Howe,
Burgoyne, Henry and John Downer, Handyside,
Moule, Gillen, Caldwell, Stock and a few others
willexprct invitations to accept office !
Premier Shiels has pub his foot in it.
After the general election he cabled to Agent-
General Munro, jubilant over “only about five
Labour members returned ” —a statement obviously
meantto be private, but Munro revengefully rushes
with it to the Times. And now Staughton, M.L. A,,
gravels Shiels by asking what it meant.
According to London Times, and other
papers, there is “ a serious feeling of uneasiness ”
in England lest, through Prince George’s decease,
a “ Duff dynasty ” should oome to the throne.
England has been ruled so long by Germans that
the mere idea of a native dynasty makes the old
nobility feel as if they had eaten something dead.
Dowel, M.P. (N.S.W.), has a good grip of
the silver question. He says that the silver
coined at the British Mint comes chiefly from
Australia. During 1889 and 1890, the British
Government cleared over £BOO,OOO on the coinage
of silver, and he argues if anyone should get this
seigniorage it is the country that produces the
metal.
There is over £10,000,000 worth of coined
silver*in the U.S. Treasury purchased at 4s. 2d.
an ounce. If Uncle’ Sam decided to demonetise
silver he could give it a “slump ” of Gd. an ounce
below the present low rate. But he won’t do that
—he will wait awhile and try to make the Euro-
pean states fix the silver standard at something
approaching the face value of the dollar.
As a sample of reckless extravagance in
Vic. Railway management Wheeler instanced the
squandering of £1609 a year in “tea money.”
The House couldn’t work up any indignation over
the tea-money matter, however. An ironical
member remarked that the yearly allowance for
overtime refreshments in the Railway Service
represented the cost of one Ministerial trip down
the Bay.
At a recent Maoriland bye-election, candi-
date Smith was addressing a meeting, when an
elector arose and floored him thus : “ Considherin’
that Oirishmen are becornin’ scarce in this
disthrict, is the candidate in favour of a vote
bein’ put on the Estimates to import some more?”
If Smith had said he was he would probably have
got in, but ho stopped to think over it, and the
Smith who hesitates is lost.
Brisbane Worker sums up the story of a
man, aged 50, “dead broke,” and suffering from
an incurable complaint, who was gaoled for one
month for vagrancy. He was so ill as to be near
death, but, being incurable, he was not eligible
for admission to the hospital. He was penniless.
He had no work, and couldn’t do any if he had it.
He could neither purchase food nor rent a dwell-
ing. He mustn’t steal, for stealing is a crime. He
mustn’t commit suicide, for suicide is a crime also.
He mustn’t remain alive, for being alive without
money is likewise a crime, and he has just got a
month for it. And what he is to do the Law
doesn’t state.
The Grand Hotel (Melb.) Coffee Palace
shareholders held their meeting last week. The
concern goes as crooked as Mirams’ Federal did.
A late official annexed £BOO of the funds, but gave
back £4OO, and the shareholders clamour about
the compounding. Why is it that it is blankly
impossible to audit anywhere?
About 20 years ago a young wife living in
London left her home and eloped with the usual
gay deceiver to the U.S. They lived happily
together and prospered, and when the deceiver
died he left her £62,000. Then she repented and
went back to look for her lost husband. She
HIGH-WATER MARK.
UP COUNTRY PERSON; “ That sir, is the high-water mark of the flood of '90.'
EDITOR OF COUNTRY PAPER: “ What! You don’t mean to say that ’90 flood reached so high
as that?”
U.C.P. : “Well, no; the proper mark was about six feet lower down; but the kids kept a
rubbing of it out, and I had to get a ladder and mark it up out of their reach.”
EDITOR : “By Jove, you ought to have been an editor ! ”
found him a pauper, dying of fever in a Lambeth
slum, and they became reconciled, and she nursed
him back to life, and in doing so she caught the
fever herself and died, and he got the ,£02,000.
Thereupon he buried her decently and went and
married someone else. If she hadn't eloped she
would never have got the money and she and her
lawful husband would have starved together, and
if she hadn’t repented she wouldn’t have caught
the fever; therefore it is a good thing to elope,
but repenting afterwards is a dead loss. If any
one can make a better moral than that out of it
we want to hear from him.
There .are plenty of hangings in British
New Guinea. The executioner is one of the boat’s
crew of the “Merrie England.” He is keen on
the business, and gets £5 per head for chokings
in the name of J. Bull and his business partner,
the Almighty. When the administration is
pressed for time, the following is the modus
operandi. A rope is fastened round the victim’s
waist, and another round his neck. A suitable
tree with a projecting limb is then selected. The
hangman ascends the tree, carrying the rope
fastened to the victim’s waist, and passes it over
the limb, dropping the end to the ground. The
hangee is hauled up from below, Jack Ketch, of
course, remaining on the limb. When the
“ patient ” arrives at the top, Mr. Ketch adjusts
the rope which is round his prey’s neck, makes
fast, and chops the other rope with a tomahawk.
The victim then falls with a “dull, sickening
thud.” The officials stand by and watch the
proceedings cheerfully.
CORRESPONDENCE
No notice will he taken of communications which arrive
at this office insufficiently stamped.
“E.V.” (Brisbane) : We read your story till we
came to the place where the bad man “ strode rapidly
away.” The story in which the bad man “strides,” and
hisses through his teeth and folds his arms high up on his
chest, is always a failure....“ J. 0.” (Harden): “Abysmal
conscience-crank” is a good expression. Please send
along the meaning of it... “ Timothy Bobbin ” : If you
can’t see the awful discrepancies in your tale we won’t
point them out. Ignorance is bliss when you have
enough of it... “Kanuck”: “Kikero” was a popular
school pronunciation a few years ago, but it is now almost
as dead as Julius Ksesar. We don’t know who invented
it “J.F.E.P.” (Sydney): They aren’t new, and the
haggard countenance of an old joke is just as cheerful as
the vision of a girl of 70 in a decollete costume and a baby
stare “ W.A.N.”(Jindera): Many thanks “ J.W.S.”
(South Brisbane): You are obviously suffering from un-
digested Henry George on the stomach. Everybody who
has got that disease at once starts to write great slabs of
disjointed bosh about the “meejum of exchange.”
... “W. B. O’G. (Broken Hill): Thanks. It is good, but
not new “ P.” : There is too much bang and clatter in
your poems. When read aloud they sound like a mad ele-
phant rushing a paint factory. ..“T.F.” (Gren.): To hand.
.. .“Faust” (Woollahra): You say “ there’s no such place
as Hell.” There is. Your poem is—ahem —Gehenna
“ J'.C.F.” (Fitzroy): The man who copies two out
of a book in an illegible hand and sends it along marked
“personal item” is a literary horror “Jim S.” : It is
only the fifth-rate writer who says that “years rolled on.”
~.. “ Tamati ” : Thanks. Rather long, but will boil down.
!...'“ Forti non Ignaro ” : (1) It is only a bad hash-up of
old Bulletin leaders. (2) There are 229 words in your
first sentence, and only seven sentences in the whole two
columns or so. This is too much strain on the reader’s
wind. . “D.J.M.” : Glad to hear you will give all that
vinegar to the good cause. We will contribute a bound
volume of Tub Bullktin some day “ E. Rosslyn ” :
Motive utterly threadbare ; the girl and the base deceiver
and the brother on the track with a razor and a bottle of
chloroform have been done to death “ Beppo ” : Plain
murder. We prefer our murder with trimmings ...
“ Bones ” : Beautiful lie. Will use it. Send some more.
“Brahma” : Only Bill Sikes over again without his
“ dorg.” “ Cornstalk ” : Held over indefinitely, as we
are giving Parkes a well-earned rest “Resolve”:
Cribbage, to us, is only a horrid mystery, in which you are
always counting “fifteen-two” and talking about “his
heels.” “Wafer”: Good verse about nothing
“ Sentinel” : We know that dog story, or its brother, of
old. Dog-yarns are very much alike “ Narran ”: The
real object of Land Nationalisation is to secure for the
nation at large the “unearned increment”—the increase
in land values that comes of increased population. There-
fore, even if, as you say, the issue of Government leases
does make the lessees “ land-owners for the time being,”
what does it matter? No one wants to secure an equal
hunk of land for every citizen, but only an equal share of
the value “Medians”: Many thanks “Settler”;
All right. If you want to have it so, “On the Wallaby ”
is an ass. lie is two asses if you would prefer it
“ F.T.” (Walcha): “ I visit those who my screw pays ”is
good parsonical sentiment, but it isn’t poetry.... “ G.J.”
(Orange); Sorry, but can’t find space for the amateur
bush barnstormer “ M.T.” : Your poem be upon your
own head. We give one verse:
for his mockers they’d pursue
This demon god in man,
With a mind relentless to resist
The glories of a passionate life.
Led to in social life to act in life’s great play,
Without consent to act as laws are now controlled.
" J.T.C.” (G.) : Such things are not worth fighting
over... “ “ R.R.” : Auckland (M.L.) is the headquarters
in Australasia of the cranks who believe the earth is flat.
Cant give you their exact address “Pauline J”-
Have sent you a copy.... “ D.S.” (O.) : Parody is the
refuge of the mute inglorious Tupper “ Good it I
oould ,1 Unsuitable— “ J.M.A.” (N.); The public
wouldn t stand such a climax... “ R.P.T.”; Boil it
clown. It could all be said in 5 per cent of your words,
lor 30 years he purveyed beer and other set articles to
which flesh is heir.” That is all bosh. He has sold beer
tor 30 years—that is the point of the thing... “ Wai
Rim : You haven’t struck it....“ Driver”: Which
“f O M'*”K V“v Hari ' y B ’”. (Q ' ): Good Htor - v
J.M.A. (N.): Your verse is weak, but our feelings
about tt are very strong.... “T.G.C.” : Good old scalp-
horror “Rivulet” (Perth): Received with
tnanks... .“O.B.” (Coolaman): The cheerful assurance
mi , W u asse, 4 that your poem on a dead horse
win take well to readers ”is the most wonderful thing
vie remember ~ “Truth ” : Your horribly muddled com-
munication about disembodied spirits, drunkenness, and
spectres is to hand... “P.H.” (Stonehenge); Practically
your great idea is that the State -should make bricks
without straw, and eat water with a fork, and then rush
down a steep place into the sea, and gather up of the
fragments ten baskets fu11... “ Lala ” : When a poet says
he is going to build a bower in the wilderness and com-
mune with Nature it only means that he is going to camp
out and eat ’possum “ C.H.” (Bourke): Your idea
that a Commissioner should be appointed to investigate
the workings of the N.S.W. land-laws, and interrogate
everybody who can throw light on them, is good. Also
we would appoint a man to shovel away the Blue Moun-
tains, and see who would be done first “ E.M.H.” :We
like your draft Bill for the establishment of Socialism,
especially the clause which saj’s: “Any person working
more than eight hours per day shall pay the same to the
Government of N.S.W.” That is genius ..“Benighted
Gumsucker ”: Not any great shakes of a narrative, anyhow.
•• * (S- Yarra): We forgive you—for this time only,
ii* Grafton : The climax doesn’t amount to anything.
He staked a bad note against a good one and won
O.P. : It was rather a neat idea of the N.S.W. Railway
Commissioners to appoint a board of their own to investi-
gate the Tarana disaster, and anticipate the report of the
Government Commission... “ P.M.H.” : Same thing done
in The Bulletin a week or two ago. Send something
fresh.... “W. E. Franklin”: G00d.,,. “A. M‘K.” : If you
want to know whether a book is procurable, write to a
good bookseller.,.. “Justinian ”: We are not prepared to
argue with anyone who says that manhood suffrage is “ a
fraud and a delusion.” Besides, manhood suffrage is as
inevitable as death... “ Subscriber ” (Bre): Mr. Robinson
evidently labours under the hallucination that there is
a tariff fixed by law for the privilege of thrashing any man
j'ou don t like. Never was there a greater delusion. If
an assault is the immediate and unpremeditated outcome
of a violent dispute, the law can often afford to take a
lenient view of it; but Tub Bulletin considers that while
there are Courts to invoke, any man who deliberately,
and of malice aforethought, assaults another, should be
sent to gaol, without the option of a fine at all.
< v? ssau .^ s ale on 'y lynchings in a mild form....
‘ Gobbora ” ; Sorry we can’t interpret the sketches....
Kanui ’’; A vulgar and uninteresting alcoholic grievance
■ • • • * ‘ K.E.S.” (St. Louis, U.S.): Book not to hand....
8.A.G.”: Quite unsuitable.... “John B.” : Well what
about him and the rich widow? “ Alfred O.” (P.): No,
keep your crank yourself, thanks.... “ Surly Bob”: No,
they are not the same. “ The Banjo ” is still alive ;
“Surcingle,” alas, is dead.... “Jay-Jay ” : Such verses
would make the dead man arise from his narrow bed.
You are as bad as the author of “Sis and Little Joe” ...
W.A. ’ (W.A.): We don’t want criminal libels about
unknown persons. If you run away with a woman, run
away with a handsome woman ; if you libel a man libel a
man who is somebody. The Bulletin wasn’t established
to enable malicious people to get level with their enemies
. ...“A.H.” (Sen.): You will “take half the profits
accruing from the publication of your condemned cell
poem.” Profits! Why, it would ruin any paper. ..
“ A.R.0.” : What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the
gander. Why should not the employers on their part
deposit with the men’s representatives securities for their
own good behaviour ?.. “J. O’R.” : Why not send con-
centrated matter? We really can’t publish a bumble-
footed Illiad or a knock-kneed Paradise Lost over every
two-cent occurrence. If we tried to do so, about four
items would mop up the whole space of the paper. ..
“ J D.” (B.): You don’t give us the title of your MS.,
“J.E.T.”: We don’t remember it. Anyhow, such a
theme wouldn’t have suited.... “ Pithias” : “ Deeming ; a
phychological study.” What’s that? ...“ Francis A.” :
Again do we hear the grey-headed story about the priest’s
nigger christening a beefsteak... “Ajax”: The form in
which you send j our copj’ will make people suspect j'our
originality. No original writer in our experience ever
drew lines with the aid of a ruler between his verses....
“ G.E.C.” : Your book of clippings is not yet to hand...
“ W.H.” (Towers); Perhaps funny locally, but Greek out-
side your little Pedlington. [Many replies held over.]
A Funny Game.
A few friends met the other night in a Newtown
store to spend a jovial evening, but as they were
all teetotallers and none of them drank anything
stronger than Clements Tonic, drunkenness was
out of the question. Mac. proposed a game
at euchre, and Jones said they had better play for
something just to give the game an interest and
make it lively, but times were hard, so they did
not care to play for money. Smith, however,
spied a box of Fletcher's bilious and liver pills,
and proposed that each time a man was beaten he
should take a pill, and this made the game lively
and the fun was fast and furious. Simpson
swallowed five, Jones got away with four and
Smith and Hopkins two each and Mac. got off
scot free. The game terminated by a general
exodus at 3 a.m., for Dr. Fletcher’s pills never
labour in vain. They are the best and mildest
pills made and are sold by all chemists and
druggists everywhere; being a positive, safe,
and reliable cure for constipation, liver complaint,
headache, &c. They always give satisfaction.
The proprietors give away £5O (in seven prizes) at
Xmas, for the seven first nearest guesses sent in,
as to how many of these pills a large Clements
Tonic bottle (now full) holds. A guess form is
around every box, and all such forms are eligible
for this competition that come from around a box.
One box of Fletcher’s Pills proves their virtues
and they can be obtained everywhere at Is., or
post free 13 penny stamps, from F. M. Clements,
Newtown, N.S.W.

Society
A very strange, precarious being is the
pious female who assists at bazaars, and who from
time to time “ lives on the game.” She is always
hard-up and seedy and in debt to her landlady
just before a bazaar comes off, and immediately
after the bazaar she squares up and makes a fair
start. Still she always gives her services gratui-
tously, and “ hellups ” with a disinterested eye to
the good of the cause. Perhaps, after all, the ex-
planation is simple enough. When a miserable male
being is deluded into a bazaar, and a grisly she-
horror rushes at him and sells him a ss. doll for
£2 10s., he has absolutely no means of knowing
whether she keeps 30s. of it for herself or not.
You can’t check the accounts of a bazaar any
more than you can audit a whirlwind.

Several N.S.W, civil servants, devoted
husbands who had to absent themselves from
office through the very serious illness of their
wives, have lately lost their appointments, in each
case through Madame —poor innocent! —looking
in on the departmental head to enquire whether he
had seen Mr. So-and-So, who was missing from
home. The curious part of it was that in at least
one instance the old man dropped in the day after
the chief (who kept mum) had been visited by
the old lady, and explained that he was sorry he
would have to stay away a while longer as the wife,
though a little better, was still very ill indeed.
The cruel boss, curious to see how long the game
would be kept up, gave him more rope, and next
morning the wife called again to enquire whether
there were yet any tidings of the good man.
Moral : Always confide in your wife.

Has everybody heard of the Melbourne
“mining” masher who made a heavy, languid
arrival in Broken Hill during the drought, and
engaged a room at Elliott’s hotel ? He felt awf’ly
seedy after long journey, you know, and before
turning in, bai Jove ! requested the chambermaid
to dust the bath-room carefully, because he would
take a protracted cold shower in the morning.
Having been aroused at the appointed hour, the
distinguished stranger tripped along the corridor
in his pyjamas, and found the bath-room supplied
with every necessary except water. The shower
seemed to be turned off at the meter; also, the tap
produced no result. He sent for the landlord, and
was very angry indeed, but Elliott appeased the
wrath of his new lodger by requesting him to come
downstairs for the bath. There were no showers
available upstairs, explained the landlord. So
they descended amicably to the ground-floor.
“Now,” said Elliott, “if you’ll kindly walk out
into the street I’ll pour a bottle of sodawater over
you.”
* * •
An official excuse for the refusal to allow
a post-mortem examination of Deeming’s brain was
whispered to The Bulletin. The application
was considered to come from a “party ’with a
theory to prove; but if the name of a disinterested
umpire, such as Professor Allen, had been
suggested Premier Shiels would have willingly
given his consent to the cutting open of the
corpse’s head. Then why, in the name of Science,
didn’t Shiels allow the judicial murder of Deem-
ing to be justified, or proved illegal, by stating
what should be done with the man’s brain, instead
of merely saying that he saw no reason for per-
mitting something else ?

Lord Charles Scott took his portmanteau
to Government House, Melbourne, last week,
slept there, and went off in a cab next morning to
get his war-paint that he might return to pay an
official visit to Hopetoun, just—thus the Age
puts it—“as if he had not dined with him at
breakfast” a couple of hours before. Subse-
quently the two Excellencies drove together down
to Williamstown. Scott boarded the Orlando
right away, and when a gun had been fired to
denote that the Admiral was officially ready,
Hopetoun came along and presented himself in
the Queen’s name ! It is by such means as these
that the British Constitution is kept on its fat
old legs.

and £40,000, was a most pious person, and fre-

The story goes that had the jury in a
certain divorce-case returned a verdict for the
petitioner, the presiding Judge would have had
two witnesses arrested on a charge of perjury; in
fact, it is said that the matter had gone so far
that the warrants had actually been made out,
and were “ lying in the office.”

In Sydney Divorce Court: —
Co-respondent’s explanation of the incident on the
night that the alleged impropriety was said to have been
committed was that lie met respondent by appointment to
give her some ham and cake for her children. She com-
plained of the ill-treatment of her husband. He kissed
her on the forehead and told her not to cry, as all things
would be right in due time. Then he started to speak
about the Botany Handicap. While the conversation
between them was taking place the husband appeared.
Petitioner knocked his wife down. He repudiated the
assertion that there had been impropriety between himself
and the respondent.
Beautiful!

Despite the large number of questions
answered in favour of defendants by the jury, the
judgment in the big Queensland Investment cases
is still an open question. To a very great extent
the matter rests with the Chief Justice whose
summing up was strongly in favour of the plaintiff
company. So far the costs in the Queensland In-
vestment cases amount to nearly .£50,000, or an
average of illooo a day. Edwin Lilley’s bill must
be fully .£2OOO, Byrnes’, the Solicitor-General’s,
,£l3OO, and Virgil Power’s about the same. Among
the lesser lights Woolcock takes £700; Shand,

guineas a day the jury scoop <£2oo each, and the
end is not yet.
In the beginning the prosecution in the Queens'
land Investment cases monopolised the Bar. It
retained Griffith, Real, Power, andLilley. The de-
fence protested, and was allowed Power. The coali-
tion between MTlwraith and Griffith took away
Griffith. Then Real was promoted to a Judge-
ship, and left Lilley the lead. The case fell to the
lot of the Chief-Justice because the Full Court
could not hear it. Real was debarred because he
had drawn up the pleadings as a barrister, and
Harding because his wife is a sister of one of the
defendants,

The new Victorian Art Gallery received
its baptism of fire, so to speak, on varnishing day.
Half-a-dozen pictures had been sent in by James
Peele, and to his deep disgust an autocratic com-
mittee, with no eye for the beautiful or sense of
the sublime, “ chucked ” four of the contributions
and hung the other two on the line. Peele, like the
rest of the fraternity, is a demon when he’s roused,
and this roused him. He stormed the premises,
and demanded the instant release of the two pic-
tures not already rejected. Furthermore, he
attempted to carry them off whilst the Gallery
authorities read the Riot 'Act and repulsed the
invader all along the line. Then Peele
dissembled. He , assumed an air of resig-
nation until the sentinels had relaxed their
vigilance, when lie rushed forward with his sabre,
or whatever it was, and cub out his canvasses
before their very eyes. An artist brandishing a
bit of cold steel is not a matter to be trifled with,
consequently the hanging committee stood aloof
and cogitated until they could swoop down upon
their agitated brother from the rear. A wild
struggle for the two works of art was interrupted
by the arrival of a policeman, and the rest of the
tumult is involved in a mist of conflicting evi-
dence. It is vaguely understood that Peele threw
his pictures out of the window, only to be re-
captured by the committee, and that the curtain
fell upon the escape of the prisoner pursued by
pots of varnish and howls of execration. Peele
now talks of “ pulling ” the Association for
damages.

A project was on foot some time ago
to start an Australian Club in London, where
“colonists” might meet and fraternise. The
scheme failed (as might easily have been pre-
dicted) owing to a difference of opinion amongst
the promoters as to who would be eligible for
membership, for it would never do, you know, if
you didn’t draw the line severely according to the
position of people he;e, and not their social
station in the— aw—colonies. You can’t expect
Anglo-Australians who are in sassiety in London
to rub shoulders with “nobodies.” St. Stephen’s
Club is the haven for all stray “ colonials,” who
are run in there on the slightest provocation.

Mr. Frank Pixley on marriage
At bottom, the controversy turns on the question !
Whoso interest should be consulted in remodelling the
law of marriage? It cannot be denied that for the woman
the old church belief that marriage is a sacrament, and
that what the church has joined together man tcannot
cleave astlnder, is the best system that could be devised.
She has got her man Where he Cannot escape, and though
he may beat Her, it is better to be beaten than to go
hungry. Women, if they are wise, will stand by the
church. For the children, a well-guarded divorce law is
probably desirable. It is not best that they should grow-
up amid strife. The courts, in decreeing divorces, award
the custody of the children to the most deserving parent,
and provide for their support. Some French writers argue
that divorces destroy community of interest and common
affection, and care for the children ; but long before
a family feud reaches the stage of divorce, that
affection and that care have become attenuated.
For the man, the system of marriage leases, which would
obviously lead to a modernized system of polygamy, is
probably the more attractive plan, where the man’s
means can afford it. Under the Mona-Caird-Donnisthorpe
rdgime, a man marries the girl of his heart, say, for a
couple of years. At the end of the 24 months, she has
given him a child, but her plumage is bedraggled and she
lias lost the piquant flavour of novelty. He sees another
budding Hebe, and invites her to become a member of
his household, say, for another 24 months. He does not
discard number one. By no means. She looks after the
house and her baby, while the gentleman looks after
number two. Of course, this is the luxurious life of the
sheik of the East. But unless ladies are prepared to put
np with it, they had better not monkey with the
institution of marriage.

A British society paper publishes a wail
about the failure of women's chibs, and wants to
know why these institutions always start with
brilliant prospects, and then, in a very few weeks,
die a natural death. There are a good many
reasons, and they arc tolerably obvious. Men use
their clubs to drink and smoke in, but the club
woman can't drink and smoke in comfort for fear
some other member will go out and blast her
character by informing on her. Men play cards
to a considerable extent in their clubs, but the
female card-player either cheats or doesn’t
pay up, and therefore the whist circle goes
to wreck. And, above all things, men find
a club a handy place in which to lounge at
case, and a woman can’t be at ease unless she
takes off her hat, and lets down her hair, and
loses all her hairpins, and takes her dress right off,
and loafs in her petticoat and stays. This is the
absolutely fatal point. No woman can lie around
comfortably when her hat is held on by a big
skewer driven through her brains, and her hair is
so tight that it is lifting her right off her feet, and
her boots are so tight that they are dragging her
head off, and she can’t breathe by reason of her
dress. When a really successful ladies’ club is
established it must be a cast-iron rule that each
member shall hang up her frock in the ante-room,
and deposit her hat and her boots in the rack, and
leave her hairpins and her skewer with the secre-
tary.

The Bulletin portrait of Deeming hang-

history of illustrated journalism, and as a faithful
representation of a spectacle that is already impos-
sible in several of the more Christian countries
and states, also as a shocking example of what
may happen to a successful lady-killer, it filled a
long-felt want. The Law, as this miserable
wretch complained to the executioner, makes a
“guy ”of its victim before the sacrifice. So care-
fully is the doomed individual robbed of all out
ward semblance of humanity that the witnesses
of a “successful” hanging can almost persuade
themselves that they have assisted at the mock
murder of a lay figure. An exceptional oppor-
tunity for giving the object in mid-air a chance to
assert its true ghastliness was not to be missed.

Of the window and watched, as a maiden may do,
For her lover. The sun dropped so soon o’er the hill,
And a venturous star for a moment peeped through
Ere upfolding the curtain—the curtain of blue.
And she sighed, but a rosebud that clung to the wall
Crept nearer and whispered the words in her ear—
" Though lovers forsake thee and fortunes may fall,
Still beauty like thine should have nothing to fear,
We will dream not of winter while springtime is here.”
But hark ! Now' the tremor has fled from her lips,
And clouds disappear from a brow overcast—
'Tis the sound of a wheel, ’tis the crack of a whip,
And she smiles once again, though her heart’flutters

VALE (VARLEY), ETERNUM VALE !
Evangelist Yarley has been keeping quiet
lately. Perish the thought, but is he dead ? Per-
haps so, and the sequel may be thus :
Beside the Stygian Stream ’e slunk, with scarce the chip
to pay,
And there was cheers and likewise groans, for it was
settlin’ day ;
Packed in old Charon’s ferry-boat each soul was in its
place,
And Varley’s crunched among ’em without ’is well-fed
face ;
But their songs and shouts and strokes so smooth, was
sorry shams to me,
For my ’eart it bled for Yarley, Yarley,
For some stood there elected, but Varle3 r , w'here was ’e ?
Only a few brief years ago we saw Mm take Ms stand,
A-layin’ down Divin’ty with the new text in Ms ’and,
How swelled and glad was every heart, what tears of joy
was shed,
To see th’ imagined ’alo as circled Valley’s ’end ;
But now rude fundamental facts ’as waved that glare
away,
The glare that altered Varley, Yarley,
From simple Mr. Ohadband into somethin’ more than clay.
Oh, yes, thou mighty classic text, thou’st ’ad enslavin’
sway,
Voiced loudly forth by pedants as blew fresh tunes twice
a day.
Now just extend some snowy shroud a background bright
to make,
Let it be clear as precious pearl, washed white but still
opaque,
To silhouette the outlines of, and gloomily display
The tremblin’ shade of Varley, Varley,
The non-elected shade of Mm ’oo warn’t even clay.
On with your cargo, Charon, pass pulling proudly by,
Ho, regenerate Salvationists, your banners raise bn high ;
Bawl, Buddhists, bawl with lifled voice, and moralists
give praise,
And you ’oo’ve lived good useful lives your enraptured
spirts raise ; ,
But thou ’ast cried, invectified, and made believers pay
To fat the face of Varley, Varley,
That face that shone so well on earth is rightly judged
to-day.

Cleaning Up.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the horse has been unharnessed and we’vo
flushed the old machine,
And the water o’er the sluice is running evenly
and clean ;
When there’s thirty load before us, and the sun is
high and bright,
And we’ve worked from early morning and will
have to work till night,
Not a man of us is weary, tho’ the graft is pretty
rough,
If we see the proper colour showing freely through
tho stuff.
Witli a dandy head of water and a youngster at
the roar
To hand along the billy, boys, and keep tho tail
race clear,
Wo lift the wash and flash the fork and make the
gravel fly.
The shovelling is heavy and we’re soaked from
heel to thigh ;
But it makes a fellow tireless and his thews and
sinews tough
If the colour’s showing freely as he gaily shifts tho
stuff.
When Geordie Best is pumping to a rollicking
refrain,
And Sandy wipes his streaming brow and shakes
the fork again,
The pebbles dance and rattle and the water seems
to laugh—
Good luck is half the battle and good will's the
other half;
And no day’s too long and trying and no toil is
hard enough,
When we see the colour showing in each shovelful
of stuff.
Can the mining speculator with a pile of golden
scrip,
Or the plunger who has laid his all upon a winning
tip,
Or the city man who’s hit upon a profitable deal,
Ivnow tho wonderful elation that the lucky diggers
feel
When Fortune’s smiled but grimly and the store-
man’s looking gruff,
And at last they see the colour showing freely in
the stuff ?
Never ! Tis a rapture that no other winner
knows
Not the soldier coming homeward from the con-
quest of his foes,
Nor the scientist successful from his searches in
the skies;
Not the ecstasy of misers that the minted gold
supplies,
Nor the gambler’s sordid pleasure, feels the digger
bold and bluff
Who feeds the sluice and sees the colour shining in
the stuff.
Then lift the wash and flash the fork and make
the gravel fly !
We can laugh at all the pleasures that all other
men enjoy
When the water o’er the sluice is running evenly
and clean
And the loaded ripples shine out with a lovely
yellow sheen.
No day’s too long and trying and no toil is hard

E.D.
Stamey, ex-secretary of Bourke (N.S.W.)
Shearers’ Union, got into gaol at the wrong time.
His friends had, it is said, just got him a Civil
Service appointment.
There has been a change in the Melbourne
Herald proprietary, and once a week for the
future a paragraph will pop up in the evening
journal announcing that the latest number of the
Weekly Times is full of interest. Anyone as-
suming therefrom that the decrepit periodical in
question is run by the syndicate (formed from the
debris of the Telegraph disaster) who took over
the ’Erald will net make a mistake.
A paragraph re blackballing at the Austra-
lian and Union clubs, Sydney, reminds a corres-
pendent of a ballot which took place some years
ago at the latter. ‘‘ Billy ” F , t he well-known
squatter, then a very rich man, was proposed for
the Australian, and Mr. F. G , who was (this
was before silver-booms were heard of) a big wig
at the Bent-street -establishment, set himself to
get Billy “ pilled’’—and succeeded. Some time
afterwards, Mr. F. G was a candidate for the
Union, and Billy made no secret of his intention
of returning the compliment paid him at the other
club. When the day of ballot arrived the Union
witnessed such a scene of excitement as never was
seen in a club before. It was pretty well known
who vvas for and who was against the candidate
and his chances were calculated to a nicety. One
black-ball in ten would exclude him, and after
summing up all the whites he could get
it was found that unless Percy Simpson
(since dead) was got rid of in some way the
big man would be pilled. “ Ranny ” Want
Simpson’s brother-in-law, undertook to do the
trick, which he accomplished thus : Simpson was
a stock-agent, and very keen on business. Ranny
went to him during the day, and told him that
there was a mob of “fats" on the road near
Parramatta, and he wished him to go and inspect
them, as they would be placed in his hands for
sale at Homebush. The bait took, and the pair
started off in a buggy in search of the cattle,
ihey got nearly as far as the Parramatta toll-bar
when Simpson said—“Where the deuce can the
mob be ? We should have met them before if they
are to be in time for to-morrow’s sale.” Ranny
smiled, pulled out his watch, and seeing that by
no possibility could Simpson get back in time for
the ballot, which closed at five o'clock, said “I
don’t think we shall meet them to-day, Percy,’ old
man \ the fact is, there are none to" see. i only
brought you out to keep you from pilling Fred
G , and now it’s too late. Let’s have a drink
and go back.” And thus was the great man
elected for the Union.


Not only are Melbourne compositors to
have their wages reduced from Is. ‘-Id. to Is. Id.

papers, a general docking of salaries will pe
place. The, literary staff of one paper is being
largely reduced. The collapse of the Melbourne

Tin 1 Automaton “ ALi ' during the last month has been
on view at Collins’s Music Hall, Islington. A new Auto-
maton which the Inventor, A. De Lacy, has termed
'• ALI,” following custom immortal ; the lieu re is dressed
in a turban and Oriental costume, it is worked by elabo-
late wire works, the motive power being electricity. The
movements are natural and lifelike, and paradoxical
as it may seem it has not the appearance of being an
Automaton. “ALI ” turns the leaves of the Koran,
becomes warlike and goes through sword exercise, plays
tambourine and bells, and altogether completely succeeds
iu engrossing the attention cf the audience, in interesting
them" and winning loud applause. The whole network of
wire, by which the movements of the figure are deter-
mined, is exposed by tiie Inventor, Mr. De Lacy, who
must, have taken years to have brought his mechanical
figure to perfection.

The Wealth of New
Zealand.
"IyTEW ZEALAND is a country which is
J3I blessed with great mineral wealth, and it
also must have struck all travellers and residents
what an immense amount of beautiful foliage
covers every hilltop and valley.
So far science has not done much to discover the
hidden good qualities contained in the vegetation
of this colony, but there has been a lady at work
for the past 30 years, who has devoted her life to
actions of mercy and being of benefit to mankind
generally. We refer to Mother Mary Joseph
Aubert, who has spent most of her life amongst
the Maoris, and during that time she has been
fortunate in discovering the most valuable reme-
dies for diseases in the vegetation which grows
everywhere around us. It is most natural that a
country so bountifully supplied by Nature in
mineral, should also have its vegetable wealth;
and we must all be truly grateful to Mother
Mary Joseph Albert for her untiring research,
and which will now bring in its own reward to
herself in the fact that her life has not been mis-
spent, but will hereafter be of great benefit to
suffering humanity.
Paramo is a splendid medicine for complaints of
the Liver and Kidneys.
Marupa cures Asthma, Coughs, and all
Bronchial Affections.
Natanata prevents and cures Diarrluea, Vomit-
ing, and General Sickness, whilst
Karana is a most excellent Tonic, giving
splendid tone to the Stomach.
If you suffer from any of these complaints
kindly give the medicines a trial, and note the
great benefit to yourself.
Sister Mary Joseph Aubert says she has kept
some of these medicines herself for 12 years per-
fectly good, so that no fear need ever be enter-
tained of them losing their now well-known
merits.
The preparation of them all is carried out under
her own supervision, and only the most efficacious
plants are used in their manufacture.
The Rev. Sister has been for over thirty years
experimenting, and during that time has success-
fully treated hundreds of cases without fee or
reward ; and, seeing the great benefit that may
accrue to mankind generally, has consented to
have the medicines put up in saleable form and
offered to the public under the names of PARAMO,
NATAN AT A, MARUPA, and KARAN A, and
which have been registered for protection and to
avoid plausible imitations.
Testimonials have never been asked for, but
we present a few which have been given entirely
unsolicited.
The medicines are not altogether unknown,
because in whatever district the Rev. Sister has
been stationed there are numbers of persons who
can vouch for the efficacy of the remedies.
ARCHBISHOP REDWOOD certifies that he
himself has seen and heard of many cures, and his
certificate, as printed herein, will go a long way
to prove that the public are getting a genuine
article, and not one which it is expected to sell by
extensive advertising, although there may pro-
bably be no benefit attached to it.
Sister Mary Joseph Acbert’s remedies are
genuine, and can be proved by any person who
will have faith enough to persevere with them.
Sister Mary Joseph Aubert guarantees no
immediate remedy, but is certain that any com-
plaint as specified under the different headings
will be successfully cured after a fair trial, and
asks all sufferers to obtain the medicine from the
nearest chemist, or if not kept by him, to write to
the Wholesale Agents, Messrs. Elliott Bros.,
Australian Drug Co., who will advise them where
to get it.
KISSING IN
THE STREET
SURREPTITIOUSLY extracting bliss from
lO the lips of a pretty gitl has not infrequently
proved a costly form of enjoyment to the
“kisser;'’ but it is only once in a lifetime that a
man receives punishment in any shape for kissing
his own wife. They manage that kind of thing
in Boston, however. According to a recent cable-
gram to an English paper, a prominent citizen of
the “hub of creation” and his better half were
arrested there for having violated the ordinance
which prohibits “kissing in the street.” The
guilty pair were what is usually termed “newly-
married,” and happening to meet in the street
after a few days’ separation, they proceeded to
indulge in a mild matrimonial salute, thereby
“ bringing themselves,” as a newspaper report
informs us, “ under one of the old Puritan bylaws
which has'nevcr been repealed.” New, one of the
chief recommendations of a kiss is spontaneity,
and the proverb that “stolen kisses are sweet”
is as true as it is timeworn. Fortunately, in
Australia there are no antiquated restrictions in
force as in Boston, and whether upon the wharf,
at the- door of an omnibus, on the railway-plat-
form, or under the sheltering fig-trees in the
public paik, persons of the opposite sexes may
indulge in the oscillatory exercise that gives zest
to an affectionate meeting or leave-taking, with-
out being subject to the interference of the “man
in blue.” No person of sober judgment will deny
to a fellowman the right to participate in this
most innocent of all pleasures, when and where
he pleases, any more than will those who have
tried it and proved its efficacy deny that St.
Jacobs Oil is par excellence the remedy of the age
in all eases of muscular disease, and that in the
treatment of burns, sprains, and cuts it is un-
approachable in healing qualities. Even after
the failure of medical skill to effect a cure, St.
Jacobs Oil lias asserted its claims and restored
jiatients to their normal condition of health, in
testimony of which Mr. William Purcell, a miner
on the Mount Zeehan silver fields, writes : “Some
five months ago I met with an accident by a
small tree falling across my back. It gave me
what they call a ricked back, and I suffered a
great deal of pain from it. The local doctor
treated me for it, but gave me no relief, and I
got a bottle of St. Jacobs Oil and tried that.
Three applications of it proved sufficient to put
me all right again, so I have no hesitation in
saying that it is a splendid remedy. I may say
that the oil has a great name on the silver fields,
where it is extendveiy used for sprains, neuralgia;
rheumatism, and the like.

THE LAWYER WAS “LEFT.”
AN EPISODE IN COURT.
A defendant in the District Court the other day,
who appeared to answer a summons for having
neglected to settle up with his tailor, succeeded
admirably in discomfiting a rather smart young
lawyer who w r as putting him through a severe
cross-examination concerning his ability or other-
wise to liquidate the sartorial claim. When every
source of wealth and income which might presum-
ably bo available to the debtor had been suggested,
only to prove as unproductive of results as the
late Royal Commission on Strikes, the eye of the
man of law rested enviously upon an unpretentious
chain that depended from the vest pocket of the
witness. “ I see you cat) afford to carry a watch ;
I presume that it at lefist might be considered of
some value.” “Not a better timekeeper in the
colony,” was rho response. “ Maybe you'd like to
have a look at it. It only cos", me 13s. Gd., and
I’ve had it for five years,” he remarked, as he
passed over to the nonplussed barrister a series
“ E.” Waterburys “It has never been repaired,
either, although it keeps as good time now as the
lay I bought it.” The witness was on oath, as
he spoke nothing but truth. It is an established
fact that there, are no more reliable or popular in-
expensive watches than the Waterburys, whether
they take the shape of the old, plain, serviceable
“E;” or the much more ornate and highly-
finished “K ” and “N” series. These latter are
encased in nickel, sterling silver, or rolled gold, to
suite the taste and purse of the purchaser, are
jewelled in six holes, have superior short-winding
and stem-setting appliances, a beautiful appear-
ance, and every improvement up to date that
American enterprise and ingenuity could suggest.
The prices range from 235. to G7s. Gd.

When you are suffering from indigestion no good
can result from taking tonics or stimulants, which
create a false appetite and conduce to an overload-
ing of the stomach at a time when the digestive
organs are incapable of performing their proper
functions. If a stimulant is fancied the desire can
be effectually, but only temporarily, satisfied by
taking a teaspoonful of brandy diluted with water,
but if a permanent cure for indigestion is desired
take Boot’s Indigestion Cure, which is not a “ cure
all”—claiming to be a specific for every epidemic
that arises—but is an absolute cure for Indigestion
only.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Adelaide bookmakers are feeding the lawyers.
The police hold that betting, except by the tolalisator, is
illegal under the Lottery Act, and the courts have to
settle the point. The bookmaker is licensed by the clubs.
It is the clubs which should be prosecuted.

La Tosoa simply romped over the Adelaide
cattle in the Birthday Cup. She lay seventh until the
straight, and then her jockey just stirred her up and
smile'd sarcastically.

Near Tambo (Q.) an Irish new-ehum went kan-
garoo hunting one day with a friend. The chase led
across a ten-mile plain with a single tree growing in its
centre. The Irishman ran into ft and broke his collarbone.

They have a hurdler named Arnott in Welling-
ton (M.L.) who can beat Batger, the record-breaking
amateur, whom Maoriland has sent to England with Hemp-
ton the equally phenomenal sprinter. Arnott is a pro-
fessional, taught his jumping by Batger, and the pupil
has grown up to beat the master, but the amateur ban
precludes a public meeting.

The bankruptcy of James Smith, of the Brixton
(En"-.) Bon Marchb, is a weird incident Smith was a
bookmaker in his younger days, and a very hawk-like
bookmaker at that. He made a pile of £60,000 at a time
when bookmaking was a rather precarious industry, and
after that he retired from the turf, and started the
immense warehouse which made him famous and more
than doubled his fortune. Then a strange thing happened
to James Smith. His hook-nose got broad and innocent
and flabby, and the hard wrinkles wore out of
his face, ‘ and were replaced by a soft, trustful
expression, and his stony eyes began to wear a
baby stare which was touching to witness. And at length
the old man went back to the turf as the greenest of
“mugs,” and started hacking horses after the manner of
an innocent farmer from the country. He took odds from
curious “sheenies” who never paid, he backed dead
animals and stiff ones and animals on three legs, and he
made wonderful books whereby he stood to lose, no
matter which horse got in first. Last of all he broke, and
the v enerable hawk will probably end his career in the
workhouse.

Geelong football team coveted a player of
Essendon. A billet was got for him at Geelong. The
employer had his salary refunded, unknown to the
player, wherefore the employer got his services for
nothing. Truly he must have been a valuable man, out
of football hours and half times. No wonder German
clerks swarm in.

So the blow which sent Dooley out was a
“funny fluke.” As those wicked “hooks” at short
range are Costello’s most noticeable characteristic in the
ring it is hard to say where the “ fluke ” came. Dooley,
you may bet, saw nothing “ funny” in it.

An English correspondent of The Bulletin
who saw Noah Beale’s name mentioned in connection
with the last V.R.C. meeting, wonders if it is the same
Noah whose name was a household word amongst racing
men when he was a boy, over halt a century ago. Why,
he must be as old as George Thornton, who, they say,
was found on “Blue Nose,” fishing for schnapper, by
Captain Cook.

Little Beall is apparently in wonderful form

At the sale of Miller Bros.’ (Vic.) yearlings,
A. F. Bradshaw, the poetic owner of Richfield racecourse,
bought two “ racers ” for £1 and £5 respectively. As he
himself remarks in his advts.‘, “ It wasn’t bad for poor
old Brad.” The plucky “Old Braddy ”is chiefly remark-
able for the ingenious way in which he “did ” the V.R.C.,
when that body started the idea of making all clubs
within a certain radius put up at least £250 for every
day’s racing. He inserted in his programme a race, value
£2OO, for the get of his own blood sire, Yellow Hammer—
the tun being that there were only two sons of that
remarkable sire in existence, and B addy owned both of
them ! When the event came off, Tom Watson (who was
starter) joined in the race on his hack, and beat both of
the “ racers ” home. The V.R.C. put a stop to this game
after that race.

Freeman’s recovery at the log fence in the
Steeplechase on Saturday, at Raudwick, was probably the
most remarkable ever seen on a course. The horse fairly
hung see-s awing on the obstacle until Hendricks threw
all ivia weight on to his steed’s forequarter, when he
dragged himself free, and following his fl“ld won in a
canter.

The four-round spar between Rogers, of Mel-
bourne, and Jim Barron, which preceded the desperate
Duley-Ooslelloccmihat, made some amends for the exhi-
bition of the “stars.” Twice did Barron knock Rogers
down with rfghtg on “the point,” and it was only on
sufferance that the Melbournian stayed the four rounds
out.

By far the best crow, the Victorians, won the
interprovincial eight-oar contest this year. They secured
the best position and had the race well in hand from the
very start. The N.S.W. men made a better show than
was expected—in fact they were regarded as very small
potatoes by the local know-alls, who tipped Queensland.
But the home crew, a curiously-assorted set, as may be
seen from the weights, were right out of it, despite the
fact that even the bishop and clergy had taken a hand in
their training. The Victorians immediately the race
finished headed their boat round and rattled away at a
smart pace for town, a distance of five miles.

The public are dissatisfied at the manager of a
big breeding establishment being put up as judge at
Randwick. His decisions may be, and no doubt are,
honest and excellent, but in the circumstances it is most
improper to place him in such a position.

The Marvel crowd are not so clever as people
imagine. The stable has fallen “in the soup” often
enough— and look at the chances they have flung away.
Too clever by half.

The people’s favourite, honest, game old Grafton,
hurt his stifle in the Steeplechase at Randwick on Thurs-
day, and died on the passage home to his stable at North
Shore. The crowd, always anxious to see Grafton win,
yelled out encouragement to the good old horse as he
came to the third of the treble, but the cries had a con-
trary effect, as Grafton rose too soon and struck heavily.
# % *
The writer was one day passing, a house at “ the
Shore,” when he saw a lad on Harrie Aulh, holding
another horse'by the bridle, which turned out to be old
Grafton, “ Show us a jump,” cried one of a small knot of
lads standing by, when the little nipper on Harrie Aulh
hung Grafton’s bridle to a post and took his mount
beautifully backwards and forwards over the post-and-
rail fence. The youngster was Dr. Cortis’ son, and the
Doctor was going his professional rounds on his favourite.
The Doctor is having old Grafton’s skin stuffed.

Tattersall’s big sweep accounted for the big
field (23) in the Queen’s Birthday Cup at Randwick.
Marvpl was heavily backed—or at least so it was said—by
his following, his starting price being 3 to 1, but he didn’t
run into a place, Pilot Boy won, and as his owner,
Leviathan Oxenham, did not lav the gelding either right
out or in doubles, his win must have run into big figures.

There has been nought so distressing for a
long time as the drowning of the Mornington foot-

Epping, near Melbourne, by the miserable agency of
charcoal fumes.

Footballers are catching it hot just now. The
South Australians had a nice, large time in Melbourne.
No one met them with a drag when they arrived, and they
had to find their own hostelry. Then Saturday was wet,
and the crowd preferred a batch of unimportant premier-
ship matches to the intercolonial meeting. Finally,
Sunday was fine, and the Melbourne team invited ithe
visitors into a drag for a drive to Doncaster, but they
hadn’t got clear of the city when the axle broke, and the
two teams, scrimmaging like mad, were dragged along
t he street. Nothing worse than a few scratches happened.
The Bulletin cannot say whether or not
Samuel Smith, M.P., erred when lie declared in
the House of Commons that 10,000 aborigines had
been massacred in Queensland—the fact being
that so many niggers have there been ruthlessly
slaughtered, that it is impossible to say whether
the murder roll (we here assume that a Queens-
land myall is a man) totals 10,000 or 30,000.
Suffice it to say that those who, knowing
anything about the matter, venture to assert that
Queensland has not murdered her aborigines,
deliberately lie. The Northern blackfellow has,
for years past, been shot down like a wild beast.
His camps have been surrounded and his women
and children outraged and slaughtered by men in
Government uniforms —men as irresponsible as the
slavers whom the Queensland authorities let loose
on the South Pacific. It is idle to pretend that
the Far Northern niggers have ever been treated
otherwise than as dingoes.
“ Give us this day our daily leper, is the
cry now in the North. Up to date they have got
their daily leper very regularly. The last one was
a Cingalese—or rather the remains of one—who
was found, of all places in the world, in Brisbane
Hospital, where he was shedding germs from Ins
infected breast all round. He had once been a
man, but when discovered he was only a slab.
Then he was despatched to the leper-station in
Torres Straits—only probably he’ll escape by the
way, and get into the Rockhampton water-supply
—and there is room at the hospital for the next
one, who will probably turn up to-morrow. Give
us this day our daily leper !
What is all the stir about lately in the
druggist’s business? A new set of remedies are
being most prominently brought forward under
the, registered names of Karana, Marupa, Nata-
nata, and Paramo. These are manufactured in
Maoriland by the Rev. Mother Mary Joseph
Aubert, who resides at a place called Jerusalem,
on the Wanganui River. Judging by the creden-
tials attached to the advertisements, there can be
no doubt of the value of the remedies, particularly
when an Archbishop, a Bishop, a Governor of the
province, and two celebrated actors testify to bene-
fits derived from their use. Scores of testimonials
have been received from other persons. Ihese
medicines should soon make a name here, backed
up. as they are, by evidence which is thoroughly
reliable.
HEALTH INSURANCE V. INFLUENZA.
Health Insurance is of even greater immediate
importance than Life Insurance, and is open to
all men, women, and children. But the indis-
pensible system by which health can be insured
is so simple and easy that thoughtless people are
apt to undervalue it. When told that they may
insure their health by clothing themselves on the
common-sense principles explained by Dr. Jaeger
in his popularly written Health Culture, they are
incredulous. It seems too simple, clothing is such
an every-day thing; how can it have any great
influence upon the health? Yet one chief cause
of illness, and often of death, is chill, especially
when caught by an influenza patient. Against
this insidious foe, which constantly lies in wait to
attack, there is only one permanent, self working
defence, viz., clothing the body in pure wool,
which is non-heat-conducting, and which main-
tains all parts of the body at an equable tempera-
ture.

A Marriage Portion for the Puntress.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Puntress is the feminine of Punter. Unde
1 unter. _ Is it derived from the “ puncta” or point
with which we embryated the word and elaborated
our fancy martingale at Baden or Homburg with
a pin ! Here, for the sake of an extra line or two,
and at the same time giving pleasure to all, let
me show the young Australian sixpenny gambler j
how to make for himself a system such as old and 1
young idiots used to do, and still do, at the
roulette-table.
Get an ordinary sixpenny Chinese lottery-
ticket. Mark the hank on it every night or draw-
ing until only ten squares remain unmarked ; then
put your tanner on those ten until you win, and
begin again da capo. It’s not very scientific, but
it upholds the theory of probabilities.
But the puntress, our puntress. Think not that
the spirit of gambling lies in the male alone. It is
now known that women are greater gamblers
than men. Lately, ladies have not only backed
horses for thousands, but have laid them—few
openly, and many through male friends and
parasites. Why my nabs fixed on me as her
commissioner I do not know, unless it was because
I was her “chap’s” chum. Now, this man, by
name Paitridge, was generally called the Pigeon,
because he was always being plucked. He never
won. His salary was about =£2oo a year, of which
he constantly lost about .£l5O. But the Pigeon,
with his gentle, vacant face, turned out to be no
fool, as I shall show you. The puntress, Miss
Dubuque, had a father, an old curmudgeon, who
liked Partridge, but steadily refused his consent
to a match until the bridegroom could raise £5OOO,
or get a rise to £3OO a year. Then the lovers
conspired to defeat the governor by the legitimate
means of raising the required dot.
Partridge had a friend, a racing man, called
Vale, a rather crooked customer, but not very bad
at heart. To him (the flowery Vale) the Pigeon
confided his woes, with the result that a moral was
tobe so fixed that there would be no mistake in a
co rtam race, always excepting the intervention of
death or accident.
The great bookies, Bullingdean and Fishman,
were reckoned legitimate prey if they could only
be got at. Each of them had drawn hundreds
lost by the puntress and paid by me, and they
knew that I was only a middleman. I wanted to
get clear of the whole job, but was always cajoled
into another commission.
As I said, Vale, the flowery Vale, was shady—
some people called him the Valley of Death ;
others, the Vale of Leven, because he always left
his friends in the lurch. His father and uncle
were expatriated butchers and prize-fighters, sent
out because they pounded a man to death at
Smithfield. The Duke of Edinburgh will remem-
ber Gus Wangenheim’s caricature of them selling
cabbages in Lower George-street; likewise the ,
representation of Our Vale on the mirror at the i
back of the bar. I
But, for all that, if you can disabuse your mind
of the fact that the Vale was a case-hardened cad
and a scoundrel, he wasn’t a bad fellow to himself,
and you if you were “ divvy ” with him.
Thus the Pigeon betook himself to the Vale and
cooed out his woes, and then to him in reply
“Pigeon, old man, I have a good thing on—a
certainty if meant. The bookies are shy of me ;
if I want 10 they offer 3, and if I snap, it is 3 to 2
and perhaps odds on. I want to get at Bulling-
dean mid Fishman. Now, they know that what
your chum puts with them is not yours, and I
know you don’t steal it. I can only guess it comes
from Dubuque, and not from the old man. Bul-
lingdcan told me there was a lady who was an
income to him of three or four hundred a year.
He knows well enough that Kinross has no coin
and bets either for you or your fiancee (he called it
financy). Therefore, lam not going to back
Jersey Wonder, but hold off until the last moment.
I shan’t let Scrimmage know whether he is to
ride or not, but I have engaged Chippy Darwin
to win if he can at £lOOO to nothing. Now, I find
the stuff, Kinross takes the largest odds he can get
up to £2OOO. He must hint that it is for my lady.
In fact, he can post it and (privately, of course)
in her name. I promise the required £5OOO
for the wedding portion if Jersey Wonder wins
the Violetville Cup and I get over 10 to 1.”
Whether this was conspiracy or not I do not
know. At any rate, I was in the thick of it.
Altogether I got £22,500 to the £2OOO, half from
Bullingdean and half from Fishman: and the
Wonder won.
Now conics the uncertainty of betting. The
bets were for Miss Dubuque, under secrecy. But
at the settling the Shady Vale began to brag, and,
to use his own coarse expression, “ poke borak ”
at the bookies. I was there, and so was Pigeon.
The layers got a little angry and cunning.
Bullingdean refused to pay me without a written
order, knowing the coin was for Vale. To our aid
came the harmless dove, the wounded Pigeon.
Telegram : From Partridge, to Diana Dubuque—
Come at once to Compagnoni's. Lite or death.
This was about lunch-time.
At 4 p.m. a lady called out Messrs. Bulling-
dean and Fishman to a cab on the opposite side of
Pitt-street. That lady is now Mrs. Partridge, who
resides on a nice little station near the Billabong.
Siie is a cut above the Vales, who own the ne’gh-
bouring property worth quarter of a million. They
don’t call on one another : Partridge says Vale is
a married cad : Mrs. Partridge looks straight
ahead when near the Valley of Death, whom she
calls Dead Horse Gully.
Vale tried to recover his winnings and stake
from me. I referred him to Bullingdean & Co.
He then tried the Pigeon, who quietly said, “I
have nothing to do with betting or gambling.”
I have a home and a billet at the Pigeon’s Nest
sheep-station, but no welcome at Wondervale.

For the Cure of
All throat and lung diseases, Ayer’s Cherrv
Pectoral is the best known remedy. When the.
bronchial tubes are sore and obstructed with
phlegm, this medicine is invaluable. It is an
anodyne expectorant, and, in cases of deep
seated consumption, it cures the coughing,
soothes and heals the lacerated tissues, and
induces refreshing sleep. A few doses are usu-
ally sufficient to afford speedy relief in cases of
Colds and Coughs
It is also as speedily efficacious, and prompt
to allay the distressing symptoms of asthma,
bronchitis, sore throat, hoarseness, croup, and
whooping cough, and, in thousands of fami-
lies, is the only cure used. It is the best emer-
gency medicine and should always be at hand.
No household in which there are young chil-
dren, can afford to be without

THE BEALE PAfBNT
HIGH ARM SEWING MACHINES
Have, by their continued merits and the general
satisfaction they have invariably given, won the
first place in public esteem, and arc on all sides
admitted to be the best and most useful sewing
machines in the market.
FOR USE IN THE HOUSEHOLD
The Beale Machine presents innumerable advant-
ages. The mechanism and the adjustments are
perfect, while the working is most simple; and
the addition of all the most recent inventions and
improvements renders the manipulation of every-
thing connected with the machine a matter of
perfect ease. The result of this is, that with
ordinary care the machine will last for many
years, nothing can get out of order, and no time
is wasted in tiresome meddling with the parts.
It is a servant that will never grumble, never
rebel, never want nights out, willing even on
washing days. It only asks for a careful cleaning
now and then, a snug, dry corner and a little
genuine sewing machine oil. Any other oil will
make it sick, and dirt of all kind it abhors.
The Self-threading" Shuttle, of solid steel,
saves the trouble of threading by the end of the
cotton. It has an excellent tension, is strong and
simple.
The Bobbin Winder is a marvel of in-
genuity, winding and guiding the cotton by
itself, as evenly as upon the reel whence it came,
and stopping of its own accord when the bobbin
is full.
j For all kinds of family sewing and fancy the
| Beale Machine has the greatest capacity,
j The Improved High Arm. A great de-
sideratum with ladies has been the raising of the
arm of the machine, so as to allow the goods to be
sewn freely to pass underneath. This had to be
accomplished without increasing the weight of the
machine. In fact, the Beale runs with wonderful
ease and rapidity. It is almost silent, all clicking
sounds having been obviated. As is well known,
a good test of the finish of any mechanism is its
silence when in rapid motion.
With the Wonderful Beale Machine,
whether for hand or foot use, you can hem any
j width, make double seams or fells, braid stitch
| with chenille, Berlin wool, or gold cord, and such
like fancy work; you may make a pretty lace
! stitch, tuck ever so finely, bind dresses, coats, or
| carpets ; sew on trimmings without guiding, make
j frilling, ruffling, or ruching; quilt, weave your
own braid with any combination of colours and
stitch it on at the same time ; make thick, woollen
door-mats, embroidered antimacassars, window
curtains, and so forth ; you can easily and rapidly
perform the fashionable shirring or gathering so
popular for sleeves, bodies, or skirts of dresses
with an appliance supplied gratis ; lay the small
cords in hoods and stays ;do large cording; gather
with or without a band, and generally do all
kinds of straight sewing upon any material what-
ever. You can darn upon any woven goods, and
do crewel-work. The Beale Patent will pass
from eight folds of tweed or twenty of calico to
two of thinnest muslin, or even mosquito-net or
tulle, without the operator changing needle,
cotton, stitch, or tension, and the fine material
will not be gathered in the slightest. You may
make button and eyelet-holes, do over-casting,
make herring-bone stitch upon any materials.
This work is absolutely unique and can only be
accomplished upon the Beale Patent Machine.
Any of these performances will be shown at our
shops at any time. The Beale Patent makes
a lock-stitch, which cannot ravel, yet by a momen-
tary alteration the sewing can be done so as to
rip from end to end, if desired. This peculiarity
is sometimes useful when children’s clothes are
i itended to be altered.
Nickel-plating’. —ln our climate the exposed
parts of the machine, and the applicances, need
to be protected from rust. We have, at consider-
able expense, added a handsomely nickeled wheel,
nickeled plates, screws, appliances, treadle-bar
and cones. Heightening the appearance, these
improvements also tend largely to preserve the
parts. This plating is imperishable.
A special feature of The Beale Machine is
that
ALL THE CABINET WORK
is made at our factory in Sydney from registered
designs, and of the choicest
AUSTRALIAN WOODS,
Some of which arc without doubt the most beauti-
ful in the world. Suitability to the climate is
thus insured, and we are enabled to offer a greater
variety of styles, most handsome in design and
conveniently fitted for all the requirements of a
lady’s work-table.
These machines can be inspected at any time at
our principal show-rooms in Sydney, or at any of
our suburban and country branch shops, or from
travellers who are. continually visiting all parts.
All the machines may be had upon easy time-
payment, or for cash less three shillings in the
pound.

have lateiy made New South Wales their home, ii
may b as well to let them know that there is such
an . rtiole as JOSEPHSON : S OINTMENT purely
the prod action of thecolony, composed of wild plant!
indigenous to the country and nowhere else, tlu
principal of which is the EUCALYPTUS, now
so famed thoroughout the world.
Josephson’s Ointment is purely vegetable, and
Guaranteed Free from ale Poisonous
Qualities. No Artificial Colouring, as the
Green colour is extracted from the pure green
plants, which defy imitation.
WHO SHOULD SUFFER FROM PILES,
when one application will relieve you?
Read this letter and Try for Yourselves
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
Dear Sirs, —I have tried your Josephson’s Oint-
ment for Piles, and have found much relief from
using it. You are at liberty to use this if you feel
disposed.

STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen:—
Statutory Declaration.
. “I, George Hewett, do hereby solemly and
sincerely declare as follows :
“ That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt-street.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
general depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
ROW’S
DANDELION
BITTERS.
We recommed these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, in more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY
CHARLES CURTIS, M.R.C.S., England.
Port Adelade, October 30, 1880.
Read an expression of thankfulness received
from the undersigned
“I have for many years' been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feeling of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced
an unexpected and wonderful effect and change
in my system, and has removed from my mind
the horrible depressed feeling and former con-
dition of bodily ailment I have so unhappily ex-
perienced for so many years.
“ I am glad of the opportunity to make known
the excellent qualities of ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, that those who are afffeted as I have*
been may take advantage of them.
“ I remain, dear sirs,

Wolfe's Schnapps.— Sternly refuse imitations
The cabled announcement made on the
authority of the manager of the Scottish Leader
that the Linotype machine sets 250 columns of
type at the cost of setting only 50 columns by
hand, will gladden the hearts of certain big Aus-
tralian newspaper proprietors, who (two of them
not brainy enough themselves ever to earn bread
and grease as typos.) hate the compo. with a
deadly hatred on the ground that you have to pay
him more on the average than reporters of the sort
they employ,
ill-order with large bottle of Wolfe’s Schnapps.
Revelations made before the committee
inquiring into the state of the British array have
been the sensation of the week. Leading military
men concurred in the opinion that there is hardly
a single infantry battalion at home that is not dis-
affected. Adjutant-General Wood declared that
50 per cent, of the men encamped at Aldershot
were unfit for camp duty and for a day’s service
on account of youth and lack of stamina. The
Duke of Cambridge, Commander-in-Chief, en-
dorsed the startling statement, adding that if
called upon to mobilize two army corps on short
notice it would be impossible, and he did not
think it possible to mobilize one corps, composed
of 23 battalions of infantry.
Wolfe’s Schnapps has no injurious ingredients,
“ G.R.A.’s” startling likeness of the dead
Williams-Deeming was sketched whilst Dr. Pat.
Moloney made erudite comments on the physical
evidence, which proved the suspended figure to be
about half-a-million years behind the times. The
left ear of Williams, as the doctor pointed out
with Lis umbrella, was a mere relic of the dim
past. His wrinkles denoted the Darwinian man,
and his skull was pre-historic. In short,
there was nothing fin de siecle about the lump of
hanging clay save its abominable prison clothes,
and the rope cutting into its broken neck.
Through some oversight on the part of Providence
the missing-link’s next-of-kin had wandered down
into the 19th century and met his death in a pair
of white baggy pants, marked 2 S.W. Not a
mystic inscription by any means. Deeming came
to his modern end in the capacity of Number
Two, South Wing.
Cordial, Tonic, Stimulant— Wolfe’s Schnapps-
Professor Helm, of Zurich, supplies the
scientific press with a thrilling article upon falls.
According to him, the man who falls from a
tremendous height has the most enjoyable time
imaginable—till he stops. If he could fall for
ever it would be better than Paradise. He suffers
no pain, he is not frozen with terror as is com-
monly supposed, yet he is perfectly aware of what
is happening. Time seems to pass very slowly as
he goes down, and he thinks of many subjects.
There are pleasant sounds in his ears—probably
caused by the whizzing of the air as he goes by.
He knows perfectly well that there will presently
be a tremendous thud and a violent pause, but he
regards the prospect with absolute composure, and
rather looks at it from an outside standpoint, as if
it were someone else who was going to come down
with that thud, and he was going to stand by and
see the fun. When the stoppage does come he
knows nothing about it. It is a beautiful death—
to die by rushing down from a great height. The
patient seems to be a comet, or a meteor, flying
athwart the blue sky, and then he sinks into
oblivion, as if he had fallen into a sea of chloro-
form and roses, and if the fall is long enough lie
never knows anything more and nothing worries
him again to all eternity.
No other spirit is equal to Wolfe’s Schnapps.
“The whirl of time brings ceaseless won-
ders”—this saying has been fully borne out by
the great change that has taken place in that part
of George-street where stood Foley’s old-' 1 White
Horse Hotel,” in the place of which has been
erected the grand structure of Stewart Dawson &
Co.’s magnificent Jewellery Palace, the largest
and most extensive in the Southern Hemisphere.
All this has been brought into existence by Mr.
Dawson, the head of the great English firm of
Stewart Dawson & Co., Watch Manufacturers
and Jewellers, who has arrived home after a flying
trip round his numerous colonial branches and is
now creating a stir in the home markets buying
largely for the new premises at Sydney, so in a
very short time the general public will witness a
stock of Watch Jewellery, Electro-plate Cutlery,
and numerous other new lines they have just
added to their extensive business at 412 George-
street and 2 Strand Arcade, which (judging from
the crowds that continually throng that part) is
fast becoming the business centre of the city.

BY PRICE WARUNG.
From the dockyard of Sarah Island, Mac-
quarie Harbour, there passed out lazily one
morning in September, 182-, a Settlement timber-
lugger. Four soldiers and their sergeant, twelve
convicts and their overseer, were on board of her.
Till she got into the fairway, her progress through
the curling water was aided by long sweeps, four
on each side, but as soon as she rounded the pear-
shaped end of the bulging rock whereon official
genius had erected the penal establishment build-
ings, her sail bellied out and, as she felt the
impulse of the breeze, the command was given by
the Overseer, who steered, to “In sweeps !”
The oarsmen obeyed with readiness. A sweep
that could only have been properly worked by two
men was no joke when propelled by one only, and
the rowers were glad to know that their toil was
not to continue till the craft had reached the
head of Birch’s Inlet, the destination of the
logging party. Accordingly, the sweeps were
drawn in quickly —all save No. 3’s. He went on
labouring mechanically at his task, though, judg-
ing from his appearance, he should not have had
the strength to propel a cockle-shell, so haggard
was he with disease.
“ No. 3 —in sweep,” repeated the coxswain. The
man was still unheeding, and notwithstanding that
his effect on the boat’s course was scarcely percepti-
ble, the coxswain thought it j ust as well to correct
the possible bearing round of the lugger’s head, by
shifting his tiller. At the same instant Sergeant
Lockwood’s rattan fell sharply on the hands of the
recalcitrant rower. The sting of the cut was
more effective than the coxswain’s voice. He let
go the sweep, and jarringly it slipped into the
water. With a muttered curse, the coxswain
ordered the offending convict overboard after it.
“Jump in, or I’ll give yer thirty-six !”
“ An’ make ’im get my shako, Mr. Lemon,
zur!” phouted a soldier. “Th’ sail belted it orf
my ’ead, zur!” On Lemon’s touching the helm,
the sail had banged against the fellow’s body, and
his head-gear had gone overboard.
“In with ye, oT Blue-bag!” ordered the cox-
swain, “ sweep fust and th’ sodger’s cap next.”
But No. 3, otherwise “Blue-bag,” otherwise
and more accurately James Bradford, per Hin-
dostan, and a colonial transport from the mother
colony, had relapsed into apathy. He had sunk
back on his seat, and sat gazing at the distant
sombreness of the wooded shores as though he
saw nothing,
“ ’E’s off agen, sir—’is wits is a-wan’drin’, Mr.
Lemon,” said the convict whose place was next to
Bradford’s.
“Then rouse him by chucking him over? I
ain’t going to lose a sweep all because he chooses
to build castles in the air. Help there, boys—
give a hand, please, sergeant—the water’ll bring
him to, quickly.”
With a “ one—two —three and over,” the men
requisitioned and two or three eager volun-
teers—the latter acting not from cruel motives
altogether, but because they were seized with that
terrible craving which accounted for half the
crimes perpetrated by England’s expatriated chil-
dren, the desire for a new experience—hoisted
convict Bradford, and then gleefully dropped him
into the greenish waves. Before he had time to
cry out he sank.
“ ’E can’t swim, Mr. Lemon !” cried the trans-
port who had been getting stroke.
“ Let him pick up th’ sweep then !” was the
response.
“ But the sweep’s a long way ’stern, sir !”
Lemon had noticed the same thing, and brought
the boat about, to secure the sweep. He did not
care to run the risk of a reprimand for losing ship’s
stores, for though an official in command could
always make up a deficiency in such a respect by
a false entry, a mere coxswain had no books to
keep, and therefore few opportunities for covering
up a fraud or a loss. So, he thought, he would
avoid a possible reprimand by picking up the
sweep.
The fortunate Bradford —it would be absurd
to call a convict happy till he was dead
or dying rose where he sank. He raised
a spluttering cry: “Help! help!” for his
senses were too scattered to appreciate his
happiness in a moment. By this time the lugger
was nearly a furlong away, and though its crew
heard the cry, they were alert to secure the
object of their quest, which, having floated into
the current that sweeps through the bay from the
mouth of the King River to the sand-bar at Hell’s
Gates, moved merrily along, and were powerless
to aid him. He had gone down the second time
before the boat once more backed towards him —
and gone down finally before her stem cut the
billows at the spot of his disappearance.
Several of the transports of the boat’s crew
grew curiously restless as they watched for Blue-
bag’s reappearance. They strained eager glances
—an observer might have thought in sympathy
with the drowning man, or mindful of the possi-
bility of the like thing happening to themselves.
And when they realised that their late brother
ganger had given the System an unceremonious
go-bye, they exchanged low mutterings and bitter
scowlings.
The Sergeant thought the indications were
mutinous. He signalled his men, and their
muskets were clasped in readiness. But the pre-
caution was unnecessary.
“Don’t be alarmed, sergeant,” spoke up the
stroke. “Yer needn’t think we’s wext with
overseer here for a-drownin’ Blue-bag. It’s his-
self as we complain of—a-robbin’ of us— —”
“ Stash it—yer—fool! ” Aback blow of Trans-
port Jones’ closed fist stopped Stroke Tooth’s
mouth more forcibly than the words did.
To the surprise of the Overseer and the Ser-
geant, who expected a return blow and were pre-
paring each in his own way for the trouble which
might result—many a banging accrued from a
smaller trifle—Stroke Tooth held his peace. With
teeth still chattering from the shook, he murmured:
“Right you are, Jones, old pal! ”
And at the words some others of the transport
crew whose features reflected something of a
painful anxiety, smiled to themselves.
Overseer Lemon noticed that change in the
grim, stubby countenances, and having passed
through the preliminary schooling of the System
of which the alphabet spelt suspicion, he was
quick to understand that there was something
beneath the surface of which he was as yet
ignorant. What was the explanation of the stop-
page of the stroke’s utterance? —why did he take
Jones’blow so quietly ?—why were the others so
palpably relieved when they saw that there was to
be no row, for usually transports gloated hungrily
over the prospect of a fight ?
The Overseer pondered these things as the
lugger sailed on, and it was perhaps the con-
centration of his mind thereon that droVe the
thoughts of Bradford, alias Blue-bag, an ex-solici-
tor from Dublin, from his mind. Perhaps, and
yet again, perhaps not. Bradford had vanished
and would trouble the System no more. He was
now only an entry in the List of Suicides. It is
as a suicide that Bradford appears in the “Return
of deaths at Macquarie Harbour ” presented to the
Select Committee of the House of Commons in
1837 —a weak, foolish suicide. He was not the
only “ suicide ” of the same stamp,
» * *
The day was not gloomy, but as the craft
was fended into the beach, the sombre solitudes
fell chillingly upon the crew and soldiers. Except
for an occasional command there was no pene-
trating sharpness of sound. The very fret of the
waves was noiseless, and the sough of the wind
held never an accent that was not hoarse or that
did not blend with the shadow of the scene. To
the north-west Mount Direction and the “French-
man ” frowned, and miles distant though their
bases were, the eternal stoninesss of their crests
pressed upon the gang, as though they were some
massive idols of the elder days waiting with stolid
impassiveness for the living victim. The trans-
ports shivered as they relieved the boat of her
freight of camp equipment and provisions ; and,
broad day as it was, the creepings and supersti-
tious terror subjugated more than one of their
number. The weirdness of the Australian bush
became ghastliness in a Macquarie Harbour pine
forest, its loneliness an appalling desolation that
yet was peopled with gibbering images of despair.
British justice discountenanced by its charters
the employment of “unusual punishments;” but
it took habitually, at the epoch of our story,
nerveless creatures spawned on city pavements,
and placed them in the midst of the horrors
innumerable which solitude and silence ever pos-
sess for the affrighting of the superstitious.
There was a boy in the gang—-“Kinchin
Walker ” they called him —a lad of eighteen in
years, in vice forty, in courage, an infant, He
carried a meabbag of fifty-six pounds weight on
his third trip from the boat to the site of the
night’s camp. As he put it down, he dashed away
some tears with his hand.
“ Wot, snifflin’,” cried jeeringly Mr. Overseer
Lemon, “wot are you snifflin’ for? There ain’t
no parson here to come the pen’tent in ’art!”
“ — — the parsons ! I ain’t no softy to beg for
parson’s petting. But you said as I was to be
tent-keeper, sir, an’—an’—l’d rather be with the
gang.”
“ W’y ?”
“ Cos it’ll be so lonely here —here it’s dark
a’most now. An’ I’m afeard o’ the dark w’en I’m
by myself. ”
Whereupon Mr. Overseer Lemon laughed, and
would not promise to appoint any other ganger as
campkeeper. But the Kinchin’s fear was very
real. A graduation in the learning of the slums
and “ bilking dens ” had not hardened him against
shafts from the unseen world. It would have been
better for him had he been less sensitive to the
encompassing gloom. Then, perhaps, he might
not have—gone.
Two months’ supplies were furnished to the
gang. They were to work out a clump of
pine in the forest, close to the mouth
of the inlet to pick out timber of a young
growth and tender grain, which, so the commis-
sariat officers thought, took the finest polish.
There was a prospect, indeed, a certainty, of the
colony becoming independent of New South
Wales in a year or so, and then “His Honor the
Lieutenant-Governor ” would be transformed into
“His Excellency the Governor,” and accordingly
it would be nothing more than due to the superior
distinction to put some peculiarly ornate furniture
in the new Government House. Consequently,
the work of the gang was not to consist of straight-
out felling of all the merchantable timber, but
only in securing such finer-grained wood as it
came across. Thus, so long as the present camp
was in proximity to a “likely’’forest, the Overseer
would remain there, but the fine and young wood
exhausted, he would move further inland. From
the camp sites the logs would bo rafted to Sarah
Island.
The gangers knew the camp would certainly be
of no longer tenure at the debouchment of the
inlet than sufficed to enable them to work the
adjacent country with advantage. It was a maxim
of penal rule at the Harbour that mutiny was
never so much in the air as at night time, and it
followed that, as a mere matter of management,
gangs were never worked as close as might be to
their camp. Supposing that the day’s task of
felling and stripping trees had not exhausted
the strength of the men, a long walk “home”
under the pressure of a log or logs seldom
failed to achieve that (in the Authorities’ esti-
mation) very desirable end. It was highly
improbable that an incipient Catiline would find
time to develope his plans and to enlist conspira-
tors when his limbs were twitching spasmodically
from over-exertion, and every bone in his body was
crying out for rest. Therefore the selection of the
site of logging-camps was primarily determined by
not the closeness but the distance of the working-
spot. No nearer than would permit the “ log-
dogs”—such was the pleasant phrase invented by
a Harbour Commandant —to get to and from their
task without interfering unduly with the regu-
lated hours for labour —six to six. This was the
regulation.
* * *
The night the logging-party fixed their
camp was the only one they were likely to pass
during the following two months in comparative
ease of body.
And Mr. Jones, the somewhat demonstrative
person who had struck Tooth, was resolved to
make the most of this breathing-space, and to
pursue as well as he could the conspiracy he had
initiated on Jacob Bland. At dusk, the gang—
luxurious dogs!—were gathering ferns and
bracken for their couches,
“Wot yer grizzlin’ over, Kinchin?” Jones
asked Walker, in genuinely sympathetic tones.
The Kinchin, who was throwing down the last
armful of fern for his bed, was so touched that he
blubbered outright.
“’E wan’s ’is mammy ter come an’ tuck ’im
bin !” jeered Clements—a vicious atomy bred in a
London gutter.
“No !” spoke up Tooth, “he don’t like maize-
meal an’ water for tea —he’d sooner ha’ a sugar-
butty, ’udn’t yer, dear leetle boy? An’—” (this
to Jones, in a grinning under-tone), “I’d rather
be ’ad it too —he’d be a sweeter morsel then ! ’
For the second time that day, Jones forcibly
remonstrated with Mr. Tooth. Again he struck
him, and followed the blow with words which
hurt the offender more than the blow. “Fool!
Let that itch o’ yer’s ter hear yer own voice
get the better o’ yer agen, an’ yer don’t cjo ! ’ And
then he turned from the chastised Tooth to the
lad, who had seen the blow but had not heard
the words.

“ Kinchy,” he said, “ Tooth an’ no one else ’ll
chaff yer agen, m’ boy. If they do, jest yer come
ter me—an’ they’ll do it no more. An’now tell
me, Kinchy, wot’s the tr’uble ? Arn’t yer well ?”
“ Ye-es ! ’m right ’nuff, Mister Jones, that way
—but I ’ates being lef’ alone here. Lemon ses
as ’m to be camp-keeper an’ ’is cook. I dunno
mind th’ cookin’, though I knows as I’ll get th’
cat of’n, but it’s being ’lone all day—not a cove
near me !” And the lad resumed his whimper.
Jones put his hand on the youth’s shoulders in
a brotherly—nay, a fatherly—fashion ; and, first
looking round, brought his blistered lips to the
other’s ear.
“ Can yer keep a secret, Kinchin?” hemuttered.
“ O, yes !” cried the lad, impetuously, proud to
receive a confidence from so great a man as Mister
Jones —you can find any day an expert felon like
Jones, with his suite of reverent, adoring youths,
like Walker, in any N.S.W. gaol-yard—“O, yes !
On my oath, sir !”
' “ Then look ’ere, sonny ! We —me an’ ’nother
one or two is goin’ ter take French leave, soon’s
we can. An’ yer kin come along ef yer like !”
“ O-oh— oh ! D’ye mean it, Mister Jones?”
“Mean it, m’ boy—inean it!” The virtuous
soul of Jones was stung at the implied doubt.
“ O’ course I mean it, or I ’udn’t say nought ’bout
it. But »he paused to throw a threat into
his undertone —“if you let out a word to Lemon
or a sodger, yer ez good ez a stiff.”
“No fear, Mister Jones, me splittin’. When
d’ yer expect to go, sir ?”
“P’r’aps a for’night—p’r’aps a month—it all
depends whether we go by land or sea. We ain’t
made up our min’s yet. But you’ll know in good
time, sonny, don’t fret. An’ now, Kinchy—not a
word ter livin’ soul —not even ter them ez is goin’.”
“ O, strike me dead, Mister Jones, if I peach !’’
“ That’s right, lad. An’ now yer know, Kinchy”
the wretch might have been coaxing a wayward
child by his manner and voice—“ wo’s ter take all
the tucker ez we kin wi’ us. So, sonny, jest yer
prig wot yer can o’ flour, an’ tea, an’ salt from the
Overseer’s and Sergeant’s mess. Yer understand?”
The joy of the lad in being chosen as Jones’
confidant and a participator in the scheme for a
bolt was damped at this. Lemon was keen-eyed,
and so eager was he to catch his cooks or messmen
tripping in the matter of ration-thefts that not
unfrequently ho laid little traps into which only a
knowledge of his ways would prevent them fall-
ing. Jones saw the youngster wavered, and
instantly changed his tactics.
“O very well, Walker—ef yer don’t like ter do
yer share yer kin’t be one o’ us. We was on’y
wantin’ o’ one ter make th’ number right, an’
every man’s ter do somethink. Ef yer don’t care
ter come yer needn’t —others ’ll be too glad o’ th’
chance—but don’t split ter Overseer ef yer don’t
want ter croak nex’ day ! ” Having uttered these
expressions with a well-assumed indifference he was
leaving the lad when the latter, fearful at losing
the proffered opening for freedom, caught his arm.
“ I’ll—do what you want, Mister Jones ! Only
it’s risky—yer know—an’Lemon ’ll flog me to bits
if he suspects.”
“ I knew ez yet a wise lad, Kinchy—l knew
yer’d come round. Yer see, Kinchy, its on’y ’cos
I likes yer I’m axin’ yer to go—an’ ’cos I don’t like
ter see yer remainin’ in this ’ere—bad company.
’Twould ruin a saint really, Kinchin, ter stop wi’
a set o’ loggin-dogs fur long. Never furget,
Kinchy, as I’m yer friend alius. W’en yer in
tr’ubie come tor me, sonny. An’ now there’s
Lemon and Lockwood coinin’ out o’ their
tent. Better go—they’ll want yer.” Then, with
a sibillant whisper in conclusion, he pushed the
youth gently from him. This genial Pharisee’s
last words—whal were they ? Were they a
further appeal to refrain from bad company ?
Scarcely !
“Nab a little tea or salt at wanst, Kinchy—
better begin at wanst, sonny !” Obviously, a
proper sort of tutor, Mister Jones. If a thing
had to be done, why ’twas wise to set about it
instantly.
• » #
For a week Kinchy had few opportunities
of talk with his mentor, but the few that he did
enjoy were not neglected by the latter. In
exchange for the “screws ” of sugar and tea stolen
by the lad he supplied him as often as possible
with good advice.
“Keep yer heart up, my lad. Never say die !”
he said when Kinchy pressed him one Sunday
—they had met by the river-bank to wash their
clothes—for news of the scheme, whimpering the
while that he was afraid of the long dark days in
camp which grew longer for him as the gang wont
further afield. “We shan’t be puttin’ it off long
now. On’y yer see ’tis a question o’ grub—grub
an’ yer sure yer square, Kinchy ?”
“Now, ain’t I prigged all I could? Ain’t that
proof ?” It was the boy’s turn to feel injured.
“ Yes, by George, yer ’av—l’ll say that. Well,
look ’ere—bend lower, Kinchy.” The teacher
made his pupil stoop. “We must ’av grub—an'—
an’—shoes 1”
“Shoes! Ain’t them as is going got a pair
apiece ?”
“Yes, but yer don’t see, Kinchy. We ain’t
agoin’ ter take th’ lugger. That was our fust
plan, but losin’ Blue-bag like that, we don’t
care ter risk it now—we mightn’t get out o’ th’
Harbour, an’ they’d catch us easy from the dock-
yard.”
“ Wot’d Blue-bag to do with it ?”
“ 01’ Bluey was a gen’el’man wunst, y’know—”
“ That was what I could never make out. Why
do gen’el’tnen be sent out ? Why doesn’t their
friends stop it ?”
“ Yer’ve got a lot ter learn ’bout th’ System,
Kinchy. A gen’el'man never does come out ’cept
fur wun o’ two things.”
“ An’ what’s they ?”
“ Tnet he’s jumped* a bigger swell ’n hissolf, or
’cos it’s jist ez well fur some bigger swell that he’s
put out o’ the way. No fear a real nob becumin’
lag. Th’ lor don’t b’leeve in laggin’ o’ swells!
W’y, all th’ seats in th’ ’Ouse o’ Lords ’ud be
empty ef they took to a-doin’o’ that.”
“Oh, is that it? An’ was Blue-bag put away ?”
“So he used ter say, an’ though he war a
lawyer yer c’u’d b’leeve ’im.”
“But what’s he to do wi’the lugger? What
diffei-ence does it make?”
“ On’y this, that none o’ us kin sail th’ craft
out at sea. We war a-goin’ ter th’ South Seas, but
ain't got no one ter nav’gate now. Yer know
Blue-bag owned one o’ them there yots wunst, an’
I’m darned sorry we missed ’im !”
“I ain’t, though !” And the interested Kinchin
grinned so knowingly as to impress his tutor.
“ W’y, Kinchy, what d’ yer mean ?”
“What d’ yer think Lemon’s been doin’ ? He
forgot old Blue-bag went to the fishes, an’ he
issues rations fur twelve !”
Heartily was the joke enjoyed by Mr. Jones.
Lemon, of course illiterate, and barely intelli-
gent enough to weigh out rations correctly—
though entrusted with the power of life and death
over a dozen of transports —had asked the StorC-
keeper’sclerk at the settlement to note the quantity
he had to issue daily of maize-meal, potatoes, salt-
meat, and salt. The figures were called out to
him every night by Kinchin as he measured
and weighed the next day’s rations, and
he had, as the lad said, forgotten to deduct
the unhappy Bradford’s allowance. Never in
Jones’ experience had the like previously hap-
pened. For an overseer to rob the transports
—tush, that was the regular thing ; to rob him-
self —the rations which fell in through “ accident”
were generally overseer’s “perks”—was absolutely
unknown ! And for his revelation of this interest-
ing and useful fact, the Kinchin went up greatly
in Mr. Jones’ estimation. As ho patted the youth
applaudingly on the back, ho said to himself that
he could surely make something of so promising a
pupil. And to Tooth, the first chance he got that
night, he communicated the incident, and followed
with the comment: “Toothy, we’ll alter our
plans—we won’t turn Kinchy in ter shoes : we’ll
take him wi’ us. He’ll repay larnin, will Kinchy.
He’ll stick ter me, and he’ll do ter watch th’
others. They’ll suspect yer, Tooth, but they
udn’t suspect him. An’ w’en we’ve done wi’ him,
w’y ” —Mr. Jones pleasantly feigned to cut Mr.
Tooth’s throat. And Mr. Tooth laughed. A
genuine admiration for his friend had Mr, Tooth,
He felt he could even share the last fragment of,
say, a tender youth like the Kinchin with him, if
things came to the worst on their prospected trip.
But we must not anticipate.
# * #
These conversations took place on the
Sunday. And on the very next evening as the
gang in two detachments (one of six transports
and the other of four) were proceeding eampwards
to enjoy, first, the substantial repast of crushed
maize, boiled in water, provided for them by the
mercy of the System and the exertions of Kinchin
Walker, and second, the coy advances of flirtish
slumber—Mr. Jones, chief of the six gang,
stumbled. Now, when one of six imperfectly-fed
creatures, carrying on their shoulders an un-
squared pine-trunk of about 1200 pounds avordu-
pois dead weight, made a false step, the conse-
quences were apt to be serious. Not to the
stumbler; if so (in this case) he would not have
stumbled ; but to someone else.
The felling-spot was between four and five miles
distant from the camp. A walk of that length
after twelve hours spent in almost continuous
labour, to which the lash or the bayonet tip was a
never-failing spur, would in itself have been little
short of pain. The carriage of an unnaturally
heavy and unwieldy burden made the journey an
agony.
“Ready?” The Overseer had cried, as with
groaning and biting of lips, and swelling of mus-
cles and veins, the great log was hoisted by the
six men.
A muttered response of “Aye, sir!” reached
him, and then he gave the word to start ; “By the
left—forward 1”
For ten—twenty—thirty—a hundred paces the
walk remained a walk. Then it became a stagger.
But the System, ever walking uprightly itself,
didn't relish staggering prisoners. It rather
corrected them. The soldier on the left of the
six was on the alert—and it took but a second of
his time to prick a couple of the transports’ calves.
A mile —and the stagger became more pro-
nounced : a mere blind rush of wounded mortals.
And, sometimes alternately, sometimes together,
the soldier on the right and his comrade on the
left plied their bayonets. How they loathed their
task : but how careful they were to perform it ,
At the Harbour, the service of the glorious
British empire was not beloved of the soldiers
the irregular receipt of pay was not invariable
felt to be atoned for by the regularity of then
own punishments.
It was when the gang were nearing the half,
way point that Mr. Jones stumbled. A gully
crossed the path ; too wide to bridge by a tree,
trunk, too narrow to allow of being easily
manoeuvred with a fourteen-foot log. And om
ingenious Jones, the last man of the right-hand
side bearers, thought it an admirable place to
simulate a slip. With a well-done cry of pain as
though his ankle had twisted, he stumbled—
knocked against the man next him on tire other
side —fell. The huge bole, already involving the
bearers in great difficulty because of the gully,
descent, became unmanageable, and, the clutch
upon it of all the bearers giving way, it crashed
upon the shoulders of the two foremost “log.
dogs.” One, in the attempt to escape, turned his
body and received the end of the trunk with un-
checked force in his chesj;. The other, less happy
survived ; his injuries were confined to several
broken ribs.
Amidst the soon-passing excitement caused by
this event —a mere incident of “ logging ’’—the
attitude of the cause, Mr. Jones, was scarcely
noticed. It was really an expression of the deepest
regret. There must have been some humanity,
you will say, in even Mr. Jones when he could
view with sadness and bitter disappointment the
remains of the wretch he had, by the turning of
his ankle, deprived of life. Listen to him as he
condoles with his confidant Tooth.
“Tooth,” he said, “ that’s damned bad luck ! I
thort ez I’d ha’ settled two !” His friend’s sym-
pathy was fervent. Rations—and shoes—were
likely to run short since there was only the one
fatality, and to wait for another might prove
inconvenient.
* # «
Although the gloom of the brief forest day
had given place to dusk, and twilight in the Har-
bour latitude passes speedily into night, there was
still time to adiooni-h Mr. Jones for his share in
the accident. The flogging, including the stripping
of the shirt, the tying up to the tree, the casting
loose, and the lashes, was got through within four
minutes —and some seconds to spare. And for
further punishment the remorseful Jones was
ordered by Overseer Lemon to stop behind and dig
the dead man’s grave.
Jones, again, exerting his histrionic powers
affected to be greatly put about by this sentence. ’
“ I’ll hav’no time fur sleep, Mr. Lemon. An’
no rashun ter work on makes it ’arder. An’ th’
night’s cold an’ dark, an’ it’s orful lonesome.”
All of which phrases impressed the precise effect
they were designed to do on Mr. Lemon’s mind.
Would Jones suffer to the extent he said? Then
that was a sufficient reason for leaving Mr. Jones
behind. Yet —power is all the more powerful
when it is clothed with mercy. Overseer Lemon
was pleased to be magnanimous. “I’ll send th’
Kinchin out to yer, Jones, wi’ pick an’ spade an’
one rashin. That’s more’n yer deserve, for
smashin’ o’th’stiff and Clements yonder.” And
then he ordered the rest of the gang to pick up
the wounded Clements and carry him to the
camp. “Th’ log yer’ll ha’ to take termorrer,
when yer’ve got Joaes agen. And Jones ’ll go in
front termorrer ! ”
Now, this threat did not trouble Jones in the
least. His plans had been completed beautifully
—all with the exception that instead of Clements

It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Co.’s “Cascade,”
80 and 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is
just the place; it is certainly the largest and best-
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there, so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home,*

412 GEORGE STREET and STRAND, SYDNEY ; Melbourne and Auckland.
being able to return to the damp, he should have
lain on the gully-bank alongside of the other
‘‘stiff-” From the very first hour of landing from
the logger, Jones had arranged to stop the night
jjgt-e by the gully. Only—he had thought he
would be successful in retaining the company of
tvvo dead men and not merely of one.
The gangs with their soldier-guard left him
w ith a sardonic good night. Tooth, bending to
g ay “good night,” caught a whispered message.
“(Pell th’ Kinchin ter bring th’ salt.”
* # *
Two years before the first Commandant
of the Harbour had had constructed two tan-pits
for the purpose of doing a little business on his
own account. He had determined upon employ-
fag some of the transports in hunting tigers,
kangaroo and wallaby, and proposed to tan and
“taw ” the skins. Marsupial skins, properly pre-
pared were worth from Is. fid to 2s. fid. a pound in
Hobart Town, and the Commandant thought he
would secure a share of the trade. And like so
many other experiments of Early Day Com-
mandants, his plan would have proved successful
jf the main difficulty had been overcome. When
the tan-pits had been excavated, and after a great
pile of wattle-bark and quantities of alum, salt,
a nd lime and other stores and appliances had been
collected, the intelligent officer discovered that
even if big game frequented the humid forest
country, his companies of hunters could not be
persuaded to return. His project was accordingly
temporarily abandoned. The stores were, how-
ever, left at the spot pending their employment at
a more favourable time. That time never arrived.
The Commandant was drowned. And Jones who
had been one of those employed in their construc-
tion was about the only person who did not forget
the pits and their whereabouts. Indeed, the
thought had been ever present with him during
the period which had elapsed how he could put
them to the use for which they had been assigned.
And that grim mother, Necessity, whose brood
included no more monstrous geniuses than the
numerous inventors of Macquarie Harbour, had
shown him the way.
* » *
The path to the camp was within a
hundred yards of the pits, and the pits about the
same distance from the seashore. Following the
gully, brought Jones to the pits. Not even to
Tooth had Jones imparted his acquaintance with
the scene of the Commandant’s experiment, and
the thickly-growing harbour-vine, clasping the
sides of the gully in its noxious embrace, had
hidden the ancient tracks. Though the night had
now fallen, Jones—he could see like a cat in the
dark, his eyes having been trained during his long
incarceration by the persistent devotion of his
nights to ingenious planning of one sort or another
—was careful to leave as few indications as pos-
sible of his passage. He found the pits partly
overgrown with creeping plants, but such exami-
nation as he could make convinced him they had
not fallen in, and he returned to the path to await
the Kinchin’s arrival.
* * *
The lad came. Bearing over one shoulder
a cloth containing a single ration and about 15
pounds of salt—the darkness had favoured his
leaving camp with this undetected —on his shoulder
a pick and spade, and in his left hand a lantern,
he reached Jones in an almost crazed condition.
His burden was of tyrannical weight, but he had
scarcely felt it in his fear of the darkness. In his
walk, he averred with bitter plaints, he had been
accompanied by “ghosteses.” “An’would Mr.
Jones go back part o’ the way wi’ him ? He’d do
anything for Mister Jones if he would !”
Jones Went back with him some distance—and
was at once rewarded for his kindliness.
“Doyou know what I found to-day, Mr. Jones,
on the beach ? Old Blue-bag’s body ! It’s been
washed up !”
The older rogue received the intelligence with
elation, which increased greatly when the lad told
him farther that he had not had time to mention
the discovery to Ovei’seer Lemon.
“Don’t yer do that at no time, Kinchy. An’
yer promised, Kinchy, didn’t yer jest now, ter do
sum’at for me?”
“ Yes, of course I will !”
“ Then, termorrer—oh, is the stiff very far gone,
y’know ?”
“No—not very! I’d ha’ thought ’twu’d been
worse!”
“ That’s right. Well, termorrer, y’see, yer kin
jest cover it wi’ fern or green stuff till 1 come !
Do that fur me, will yer—an’ another thing ! Get
some more salt. I want it when I get back ter
camp termorrer!”
And, the youth promising a faithful perform-
ance, they parted at the spot on the path where
the flame of the camp-fire became visible. The long
return walk to the gully was lightened for Jones
by the reflection that he had saved the Kinchin
some unnecessary fear—and discovered a compen-
sation for the fact that Clements was not killed.
For the purposes of Messrs. Jones and Tooth one
“stiff” was quite as good as another. If any-
thing Bluebag Bradford, as being the more deli-
cately bred, was likely to furnish—what ?
The choicer repast, or, as Tooth put it, “ the
sweeter morsel.”
* # *
Seldom had the sustaining force of a mighty
will received more singular illustration than in
Convict Jones’doings that night. He had laboured
under a brutal taskmaster’s eye from six o’clock
to six o’clock, and his hardy frame had shown
symptoms of exhaustion hours before he had borne
his part in carrying the log. To refresh his body
he had but sixteen ounces of bruised maize—
termed, by courtesy, meal—and a drink of water.
That body, remember, had just received thirty-
six; cuts—cuts that had not been “eodgered”or
“ kokumed cuts that were intended to hurt,
and had realised their intentions. And now lie
had before him a self-imposed task that might
have daunted many hale men entitled to claim
the blessed inspiration of freedom. Yet he did
not falter. He bade his unconquerable will exert
itself, and it answered valiantly.
First, by such light as the lantern gave him,
and then by a more dreadful candle still —had he
not a corpse close at hand ? —he pursued his work
till the dawn.
He cleaned out the tan-pits of their dry rubbish.
In the one he laid the layers of pine and acacia
bark, and then, by repeated trips to the beach
with a bucket he found among the old stores,
half-filled it with sea-water. And in the other he
mixed a strong brine. A dozen buckets-full he
emptied of the sea-water into it, and he threw in
also the ration salt which the Kinchin had stolen
for him. “Food’’cured with sea-salt alone was
not safe from putridity. His next performance
must be left undescribed in detail. We may but
note the result. The skin of the dead man went
into the large pit, and his flesh, or such portions as
Jones knew from his infamous experience were
edible, was deposited in the smaller. And, this
done, this careful provider against the day when he
would grasp at freedom, dug the dead man’s
mockery of a grave.
It was only a mockery, as most of the remains
were already lodged in the pits, but yet it was
necessary to sink three or four feet at least.
Lemon, up to most dodges of convict-sextons,
and quite aware that not a few artistically-raised
mounds covered excavations only a few inches
deep, while the bodies were thrown over cliffs,
might cause a crowbar to be forced into the loose
earth to test the depth. And while Jones really
did not think he would be seriously inconvenienced
by another flogging because he had only made a
sham grave, he yet did not wish the fraud dis-
covered. For discovery possibly meant the loss
of the choice morsels in the smaller pit, and the
sacrifice of the material for the shoes.
And so he dug the grave. And what remained
out of the pits he cast or kicked therein. Amongst
harbour funerals these proceedings were not (so
history says) singular.
There were no prayets. But Mr. Jones knew
his Shakespeare as well as a prisoner of the Crown
could be expected to know him. And he chuckled
agreeably as he pushed a bone in with his foot.
“Th’ good ain’t interr-ed wi’ yer bones, ol’ pal !
I’ve kept all th’ good bits out! They’ll be of
more advantage there than in the hole.”
• « •
How Mr. Jones added Bluebag to his pits;
how a month later he extracted from those reposi-
tories their treasures of hide and “grub;” how
Messrs. Jones and Tooth with another of
their co-mates and brothers-in-exile turned their
faces toward freedom; how the two first attained
freedom (for a time), chiefly by the aid of the
moccassins made of dead men’s skin, we shall tell
you next time.

Hick was the elder by two years; he was
twenty - six, and a strapping, well - looking,
bush-bred Australian. Tom was taller and
lighter and finer - looking in an artistic
sense, but the present unpleasant twist bn his
usually bright, bronzed face spoilt his beauty
rather. Dick was favourite with Ellen Myers,
the handsome, flashy girl from the city, visiting at
the Cockatoo. Miss Myers had not been in the
locality a month, and yet there was not an
unattached male under fifty or over sixteen within
ten miles of Coven’s popular pub. who was not
anxious to appear well in her bright blue eye.
Tom in particular yearned to attract Ellen’s atten-
tion and fix her affections. Dick was not mad
about her; but he always had the devil’s luck ; she
picked him out as the object of her sweetest smiles
and lingering, languishing glances. He had not
betrayed any great anxiety to bask in her natural
sunshine, and the girl made a dead set at him in
consequence. He was the best of the pack, she
said.
Dick worked an axe like an artist, and was
prdid of his “style.” He was putting in some
laney touches, and imagined that his brother was
lost in admiration till Tom spoke.
“Isay! Are you taking that girl to Mack’s
dance to-night?”
“Which girl?”
“Oh, you don’t know! Ellen Myers, of course. ”
Dick swung his axe into the deep carf, and turned,
surprised.
“ I am.’ . •
“You run after her heels like an infernal
poodle ! ”
li It’s a lie ! Fact is yoil’re shook on her your-
self, and you’re grigged because she won’t cottoii
0 i.”
Tom’s jaw snapped ominously, his face burned,
and his fingers twitched; He was suffering that
trouble for which there is no cure short of a fight.
“ You’re not going to take her,” he continued
edging closer. “She promised to go to the next
dance with me, and by —— she will! ”
“By she Won’t! ”
Biff ! bang ! It was very quick; Tom struck the
first blow.. Dick answered \Vith the left in the
short ribs. Throughout the fight the elder man
respected his brother’s beauty; he struck only
body blows. Tom was furious—he aimed for
blood. Whilst they fought the north wind bent
the trees with a long, deep sigh, arid went on.
Giving and taking, back and forth, the brothers
dodged and fought, the blows falling sharp and
heavy. Then they clenched and Tom went down.
He was on his feet again in a second, and started
forward, blind with rage.
The wind came up once more with another sigh,
there was a sound of cracking timber, then a rush
through the air, a tremendous crash, and the tree
lay between them. The butt Struck Tom’s
extended hand and tore the sole from Dick’s left
boot;
The brothers stood for two minutes, dazed and
speechless, and gazed stupidly down at the heavy
butt; then Tom extended his bleeding hand across
and Dick gripped it.
“ Better that come between us than her, old
boy,” he said.
Con. Hoyle took Ellen Myers to Mack’s dance
that night.

Diink only Wolfe's Schnapps. Soft as love,
and cooling as his fan.
A Sydney lady, suing for divorce the other
day, indignantly denied that her husband treated
her cruelly, although he “ beat her sometimes.”
Further investigation revealed that the witness
di 1 not regard beating as cruelty, and when a
little vigorous castigation came in her way she
took it as a matter of course. The Bulletin
feels inclined to bet that that lady is English, It
is a cold billet to be ai married female in England;
and the proportion of wife-beaters there is about
the biggest in Europe. The present writer once
lived for six months in a crowded locality in an
English manufacturing, town, where the working
man most did congregate, and he took notes of
his surroundings. The lady right opposite was
aged 60 and had been beaten once a week on
a steady average for 24 years. She always
got her thrashing at about the same hour
on Saturday night, her husband being a
man of regular habits. The woman next
dobr was aged about 23, and had been mar-
ried four years. She also got a beating about
once a week, but the visitation generally took
place on Sunday, As a rule, she howled over it,
which the elder woman never did. The woman
next door on the other side was never beaten, but
the reason of this anomaly was not explained,
though the writer did his best to investigate the
point. Next to her again, was another woman
who seemed to escape castigation ; she was a pale#
thin, feeble little creature, and perhaps couldn’t
stand it. Beyond her there lived a large, good-
looking woman who was walloped apparently two
or three times a week—in fact, she seemed to be
the worst-walloped woman in the street. The
general impression in the locality was that she
got more discipline than she required, and that
one thrashing a fortnight was enough to keep any
lady in reasonable order. It was a noisy and
unpleasant locality, and on Saturday night
especially it was a pandemonium. But the
greatest trouble was not the women who were
thrashed regularly, but those who were done
irregularly. The former had a sort of fixed allow-
ance, and took it with reasonable quietness, but
the latter, probably because they didn’t know
what was going to happen, made a dismal wailing,
and often upset the furniture trying to get away.
One woman especially, who was hardly ever
assaulted except at Christmas time, made a racket
that was simply awful to listen to. The present
scribe only listened to her once, and then he
removed into another street. The idea of hearing
her again next Christmas was too much.

A few years ago, some poor fellows were
treed by the floods out West for three or four
days, but at last got to old Blank’s. One died
from exposure, and was buried near the head
station ; his mates werit to much trouble to get a
large, flat stone as a headstbne, whereon they
roughly carved his initials and date of death. A
short time after, old Blank was having his store
floored with stones, and to this day the stone,
placed at the head of the poor fellow’s grave, can
be seen in the store—the largest and flattest stone
of the lot.

Years ago a Bourke (N”.S.W.) butcher was
asked if he wanted any cattle. “How many?’
“A hundred.” “ What price ? ” “ £5.” “ Where
are they?” “Up at West Bourke.” “I’ll go
and have a look at them.” The butcher somehow
heard or suspected that they were “on the cross.”
He accepted them, and had them put with his
other cattle; and gave the vendor <£20 “to do
him the night,” the balance being payable next
itiorning. The seller put up at the local Royal.
During the night the butcher had a horse saddled
and hung up outside, and went in to the seller’s
room to tell him that the Cunnamulla police had
jlist arrived and were • enquiring for him. The
man jumped up, dressed himself quickly and
asked the butcher tb help him to get away. “All
right, old man,T have h horse saddled ready ; you
go to ’s, on the Culgoa, and I will put them
on the wrong track.” “Thank you, old fellow,
but how about the money ?” “ Oh, if you stay
till morning you can have it.” “ INo, I won’t do
that, you can send it to me.” “All right, but
lose no time jn getting Good night—you
will be all right with — for a week or two.”
Needless to say the money was never sent, and the
butcher got A650 worth of good bullocks for £20
—the owner, apparently; never found out that
they had been “lifted.”

When you are suffering from indigestion no good
can result from taking tonics or stimulants, which
c ea e a false appetite and conduce to an overloacl-
i: g jf the stomach at a time when the digestive
organs are incapable of performing their proper
functions. If a stimulant is fancied the desire can
be effectually, but only temporarily, satisfied by
taking a teaspoonful of brandy diluted with water
but if a permanent cure for indigestion is desired
take Boot’s Indigestion Cure, which is not a “cure
all”—claiming to be a specific for every epidemic
that arises—but is an ab,solute cure for Indigestioil
only.
