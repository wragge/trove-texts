Dedication of a Tree.
This laurel-tree to Heseltine I vow
With one cicada silvering its shade —
Who lived, like him, a golden gasconade,
And will die whole when winter burns the bough :
Who in one hour, resounding, clear and strong,
A century of ant-hood far out-glows,
And burns more sunlight in a single song
Than they can store against the winter snows.
Roy Campbell, in Mithraic Emblems.
Career of a Swindler.
Horatio Bottomley is probably known to most who
know of him at all only as the war-time controlling
editor of “John Bull” who shone as one of the most
ferocious warriors on the home-front and surprisingly
ehded by doing seven years in Maidstone for defraud-
ing numerous poor people of their savings to
the tune of more than £1,000,000. But that was only
the final act. He was one of the most brilliant
swindlers and most extraordinary characters of an age
that was deficient in neither. In one transaction alone
he sold 10,000,000 forged shares! As S. Theodore
Felstead reiterates in a readable biography, Horatio
Bottomley (Murray; 10s. 6d. net), the wonder was
that he did not do his seven years as a younger
man.
The fact is that there was some truth in the self-
description which Bottomley published in a pamphlet
in 1915, wherein he set himself forth as “the finest
orator in the kingdom; the first ‘lay lawyer’ in the
land; our best recruiter ; a fine sportsman; a great
financier; a fearless and independent politician.”
Under the first of these modest heads —with which
the third can be lumped-—stands the fact that he was
paid fees ranging from 50 to 200 guineas a night for
recruiting addresses given all over England., Also,
his gifts of oratory turned the tide in his favor with
juries that would have found another man guilty with-
out leaving the box. As a lay lawyer he bamboozled
the law, and time and again beat great lawyers in
almost ceaseless litigation over a term of more than
30 years. Altogether 260 bankruptcy petitions were
presented against him. What he was able to get
away with in matters of law can be sufficiently
demonstrated by one case in which he was so dis-
pleased with the presiding Justice that he addressed an
open letter to him in the London “Sun,” ending: “If
this letter makes me guilty of contempt of Court, it
is precisely the attitude from which I regard Mr.
Justice Ridley’s Court!” No contempt action
followed.
During his life he must have personally spent the
greater part of £5,000,000, and most of his claim to
being a fine sportsman rested on the fact that a large
parcel of this went on horses. He punted as much as
£lO,OOO on one race, and bets up to £2OOQ or £3OOO
on a race were common with him: sometimes, in sell-
ing-plates, he would have more than twice as much on
one horse as the whole field could have been bought
for. But, though he had spectacular wins and though
his horses in one year won 68 races, he was regarded
by the books, with ample justification, as a soft thing.
Under the head of great financier stands the fact
that his company promotions brought him in nearly
£3,000,000 altogether, and at one time he was a mil-
lionaire. The £3,000,000 represents what he got out
of promotions, not what the companies were floated
for. His biographer considers that even Bottomley
himself could not have stated how many companies he
foisted on the British public ; the goldmining ones
alone totalled £15,000,000. Many of these mines were
wholly creations of his vivid imagination, though one
or two were genuine, and winners.
In one lively stretch of 10 years he floated
£20,000,000 worth of companies, the greater part of
which were utterly worthless. Apart from this princi-
pal line of business, his “earnings” included at least
quarter of a million out of sweepstakes, a like sum
out of journalism and somewhere about £50,000 for
lecturing. He did other things in a big way. He was
notoriously the greatest champagne drinker in Eng-
land ; he ordered his favorite brew by the truckload,
and at his flat in King-street, St. James’s, he used to
have 40 or 50 cases available ; yet no one ever saw
him the worse for liquor.
His years of real greatness were the blossoming
time of many another scoundrel —the war years.
Then, though Ijehind him lay a career during which
he had been publicly denounced by more than a dozen
Judges, scathingly exposed in the Courts by famous
lawyers, had been proved an associate of all sorts of
dubious characters, had had to leave the House of
Commons because of his bankruptcy and had already
swindled untold numbers of people out of money
totalling millions, he blossomed out as a savior of his
country, packing huge places like the Albert Hall night
after night with people who cheered him to the
echo.
Bottomley rose to this extraordinary career from
absolute poverty. He believed with pride that he was
the son not of his mother’s husband but of that fiery
agnostic Bradlaugh, a belief his biographer shares.
He spent most of his first 14 years in a Birmingham
orphanage, from which he cleared out to begin life
pushing a hand-truck of samples about London. From
that he stepped up to be office-boy for a firm of
solicitors.
He early grasped that the most winning accom-
plice in litigation is the red Erring, and there was
scarcely a case in which he figured that this diverting
fish was not drawn successfully across the proceedings.
Curiously, in the end, where the greatest lawyers of
England had failed to bring him down, that overdue
fall was brought about by an illiterate old boy of
Horatio’s orphanage days, a man who had been in
turn a match-seller, a crossing-sweeper and bootblack ;
and where many thousands of pounds had from time
to time been spent unsuccessfully to that end, this
man did the job with a penny pamphlet. The pamphlet
led Bottomley to prosecute for criminal libel, and
enough came out to put him on the road to Old
Bailey and the seven years’ gaol that as good as closed
his spectacular life.
In gaol he was largely employed in making mail-
bags. He was stitching away one afternoon when a
prison visitor who knew him remarked pleasantly,
“Ah, Bottomley—sewing?” “No,” grunted the old
man without looking up, “reaping.”
Publishing Australian Authors.
From George Sutton (Hutchinson and Cos.):
I don’t agree with F. Rhodes Farmer (B.
25/11/’36) on his comments about English publishers
and Australian authors. My firm represents a large
group of English publishing houses, and never at any
time have I received instructions to avoid Australian
settings on the plea that they will not sell. On the
contrary, our contention is that if the story is well
written it does not matter whether it is placed in
Timbuctoo or Woolloomooloo. The following list
of Australian and M.L. writers will testify to this:
w
ŵ
Jazz Up Australia.
The real reason why most Australian fictioneers
fail in the overseas market is that they are too
realistic. This also partly explains why so many
local papers have closed down on local stuff —and
prefer overseas tripe at a bob a yard. Writers will
never put Australia, on the map, or themselves in
credit with the butcher and baker, until they decide
to jazz up the Australian background.
Two of my most interesting years in Australia
were spent on the track—waltzing Matilda. In that
time I had many experiences which do not ordinarily
come to the average man. I lived among the down-
-and-outermost, I begged for food, I jumped trains, I
fell (at least once) into the hands of the police, and
I did everything that the worst people do in the most
adverse circumstances. There, surely, was something
to write about. When the Wanderjahre (which took
me as far north as Cooktown) were over, I sat down
and wrote. Then I tried it on a local publisher. He
sent it back, regretting that the material did not con-
tain enough of the sunshine of Australian life.
Later, I sent it to a literary agent in London.
He sent it back; it was only about 35,000 words;
could I stretch it into about 75,000? I could. He
thought then it was not dramatic enough, but he
would try to place it. That was about two years ago ;
I have heard no more about it, and I am no longer
interested in it.
The truth is I was too realistic. I recorded life
as I found it. I wrote of the things that were hap-
pening about me. Now, of course, I know that it
was all extremely dull. The Australian background
is dull What I should have done was to lift the
whole thing into the realms of romance —and that, I
think, is where the average Australian writer fails.
Australia has most interesting fauna, but there
is nothing really exciting about it. What can you do
with a kangaroo, an emu, a platypus or a wombat?
The things simply won’t chase you. Again, the abo-
riginals are interesting to look at, but what on eart.i
can you do with them? How can you picture a love
setting—with the aboriginaless? South Sea fiction
teems with brown ladies in the moonlight, but even
if we left out the moon altogether, and put the set-
ting as a dark and foggy night—even then I dont
think we could work in a satisfactory love interest
with Mam’selle Binghi. The truth is that the whole
Australian background is terribly unromantic.
I have spent over six months in Tahiti, and,
though I know that things do not happen there as
either fiction or supposed fact represents them, yet the
background is suggestive of such possibilities. Simi-
larly New Guinea, the United States, Canada, even
India.
Further, the Australian is not easy to handle in
fiction or in romanticised fact. The average Austra-
lian is really rather dull. I do not overlook his many
sterling qualities; but he is not pliable material for
a writer. There are few real characters in Australia.
I met none on the road. The Australian policeman,
even in outlying parts, is nothing like the Canadian
Mountie. There is a terrible similarity about Aus-
tralians, so that the man you meet in gaol is really
very little different from the man you meet outside.
It doesn’t matter whether the Australian is a sailor,
a soldier, a farmer, a policeman or an archbishop—
he varies not at all. Their outlook is practically
identical.
This, then, is the writer’s difficulty in writing
about Australia. And since neither the people nor
the background can be easily transformed in fact,
then the writer’s job is to transform them in fiction.
People will not read about Australia as it is. The
question is—are Australian writers capable of writing
about Australia as it might be? The fact that the
result would bear no resemblance to reality matters
not at all. People commonly read to be entertained.
I am writing only of popular fiction and roman-
ticised fact. I have nothing to say to the high-souled
writer who is out to produce real literature. His or
her duty is obviously to tell the truth at all costs.
The production will not be widely read in this gen-
eration, or the next, or the one after that. But when
that type of writer has been in the grave about 100
years he may come into his own. I lift my hat to
such writers, because they have the courage to treat
the present featherbrained generation with an indif-
ference keener than malediction. I, who am about
to write “popular” fiction, salute them !
GERALD DILLON.
The Big Stories.
The three biggest stories in Australian literature
at the time of writing are For the Term of His Natural
Life, The Fortunes of Richard Mahony and All That
Swagger .
Marcus Clarke’s yarn is a materialistic epic of
heroic physical suffering and man’s animal inhuman-
ity to man. In spirit it is defeatist, a tragedy. Its
epic quality is in the complete ruthlessness of the
characterisation of Rufus Dawes as the convict-
exponent of the penal system. We see him in the
round, at all moments of his life. From that com-
pleteness of reality in him grows the huge structure
of his Australian environment, which puts him and
his times permanently in memory. Necessarily the
yarn is all body ; if any mind had come into it Dawes
must have gone mad in the first three months, and
there would have been no yarn.
Richard Mahony does go mad. He also is tragic,
defeatist, because he is all mind. Him, too, we see
in the round. In hope, enthusiasm, inspiration; at
the mercy of the small winds of disappointment, irri-
tation, causeless failure ; in laughter, love, happiness;
in humiliation and despair. Thought by thought he
is built up into reality, thought by thought broken
gradually down ; there is nothing of Richard Mahony
that we are not shown. He is so complete, so living,
that he also must remain in memory, together with
the life-pattern his personality creates.
It is true that Danny Delacy in All That Swagger,
on fire with youth, in middle age, in old age, at death,
insists that “It’s all in the moind.” On the other
hand, persuading his brave Johanna in County Clare
to elope across the world with him, he tells her that
“Everything is a dream till it’s made come true. Come
make this true with me, Johanna. 2 ’
Dawes and Mahony are victims. They develop
to the limit of their environment, of the dream, in

NEATLY-HANDLED DRAMA:-
A JOURNEY TO-MORROW
By
BIDDY WORGER
Drawings by CEO. H. BROWN
SAM BULLTHORP sat opposite his
wife at the supper-table in the cot-
tage kitchen. The windows were
wide open to the late-summer even-
ing. The breeze carried the song of the
birds and the scent of the flowers into
the room. Sam sniffed appreciatively at
the perfume. He loved his garden and
almost worshipped his flowers. Or so
Ellen, his wife, always said. “They
might be human,” she often told her
friends, “the way he tends them and
works and watches over them. But
then,” she would always add, “of course
they is our bread and butter, so to
speak.”
Sam had the reputation of being reliable ; his
flowers and vegetables were always sweet and fresh.
Nothing faded, withered or blemished ever came from
Sam’s gardens.
Ellen often told him he was ruthless. She’d
discovered the word in one of the many cheap novel-
ettes she read, and it struck her as being just right
for .Sam.
He was ruthless.
He never allowed anything peculiar or deformed
or, as Ellen saw it, comic to survive in the gardens.
She’d seen him destroy a whole row of potatoes
because he had found one with wireworm in it.
“Such waste,” she’d told him ; “some might have been
good, Sam.”
“No,” Sam had answered. “Them’s contami-
nated. Best finish the lot off.”
“But we could’ve eaten some, Sam,” she’d
pleaded.
“No,” said Sam, “what’s not perfect has got
to go.”
It was the same with the comic-shaped potatoes.
“Oh, Sam,” Ellen had cried many a time, “let’s
replant it. It looks like a tiger now, and it might
grow into any kind of shape if you cultivate it—an
elephant or a giraffe.”
“No,” Sam always answered. “I don’t want no
freaks in my gardens.”
Even with the flowers, which Ellen said he wor-
shipped, he was ruthless. Imperfect blooms meant
the uprooting of the whole plant. Defective bulbs
were tossed asjde on the rubbish heap. Ellen had
often got into trouble with Sam when she gathered
tomatoes for their own consumption and put one
overripe one among them.
“Don’t you know,” Sam would say to her, turn-
ing them over with his big strong hands that had such
a surprisingly light, swift touch, “that one rotten one
contaminates the rest? You’ve got to learn you
must chuck out the rotten ones, Ellen.”
Ellen always answered, “Oh, Sam, you’re so
ruthless.”
“Got to be,” was Sam’s invariable retort. “Every-
thing that isn’t clean, fresh and normal has got to
be exterminated. My garden would be nothing but
a muckheap if I wasn’t ruthless, as you likes to
call it.”
IT was this streak of ruthlessness that made Sam,
* after twelve years of marriage, still fascinating to
Ellen. Sometimes she felt as if he resembled her
conception of God. He was all-powerful. He could
say “This one is to die, this one is to live,” and it
would be so ; and she was a little frightened of his
power. Besides, she knew what no one else in the
country knew . . .
Sam sniffed again. “Smells good, don’t it,
Ellen?”
Ellen, at the opposite end of the supper-table,
smiled at him. “Well,” she said, “I took a lot of
trouble to get a nice bit of pork for you, Sam.”
“Pork?” Sam stared down at his plate. “Oh,
yes, pork. I wasn’t thinking of pork, Ellen ; I was
thinking of that there smell of night-scented stock.”
“Oh, that,” Ellen laughed ; “it’s not bad.”
In silence husband and wife demolished the cold
boiled pork. They were not a talkative couple. Ellen
liked a good gossip with the other village women,
but Sam was always silent, and, being a good-natured
soul, she let him alone.
When Sam had finished his meal he rose to his
feet and took his pipe off the mantelshelf. There
was a thoughtful, brooding expression on his stolid
face as he pushed the tobacco into his pipe. Ellen
knew that expression. Sam was going to speak —
going to speak about something other than his
gardens.
After a while, without lifting his eyes, he
addressed her. “A journey to-morrow, Ellen. My
dark suit. I’ll be away the night.”
Ellen started. The color receded from her face ;
her hand flew up to her throat in a curious gesture
as if she were choking. Then she recovered herself
with an effort. “Yes, Sam, I’d forgotten . . . the
time has gone so quickly.” She sighed, got to her
feet and busied herself clearing away the supper
things.
Husband and wife did not look at each othei
or speak. Sam stood silent and motionless, drawing
at his pipe, his eyes gazing out of the window into
the soft haze of the summer evening.
Twenty minutes later, as Ellen came back from
the scullery and the washing-up, he said: “Well, I’ll
just take a look round the gardens before the light
goes, and then for bed.”
SAM was asleep when she went up later. The
moonlight fell across the big double bed, touch-
ing his hands where they rested on the coverlet.
Ellen stood watching him for a while. How peaceful
he looked. Like a sleeping child, yet how strong
were those hands—how capable and ruthless!
Ellen shivered a little and turned away from the
bed. She undressed by moonlight and crept in beside
him without disturbing him.
But it was a long time before she slept.
When she married him she knew about these
occasional journeys he made. She hadn’t minded.
In fact, she had thought it would be rather thrilling
and exciting when he, her husband, suddently went
off for a whole night. But the first time it happened,
only a few months after their marriage, it hadn’t been
a bit exciting or thrilling. She’d cried all night and
day, and wanted desperately to rush out and tell a
neighbor all about it, any neighbor, or the whole
lot of them. But she hadn’t done that. Sam had
made her swear never to mention it to a soul. “Our
life here would be made unbearable if people knew,”
he’d told her. So Ellen had controlled her love of
gossip and her need for comfort.
She’d got used to these journeys now. She never
cried or wanted to run and tell a neighbor all about
it. She was as anxious as Sam to keep it all secret.
But whenever Sam said “A journey to-morrow,
Ellen,” she still felt a sudden fear and terror: a
dreadful choking sensation and a queer idea that
Sam was no longer just Sam, her husband, but a
complete stranger. A stranger of whom she felt
scared and afraid.
Ellen, drowsy now, turned over in the big double
bed and closed her eyes in preparation for sleep.
Her last waking thought was, “It’s silly of me to
feel like that. These journeys don’t really change
Sam. I haven’t any reason to feel scared or fright-
ened of him.”
SAM worked in his gardens all the morning. It
was a perfect summer day. Blue skies, warm
sunshine, birds singing, bees droning from flower to
flower.
Indoors Ellen worked in the cottage. She did
all her sweeping and dusting, prepared the midday
meal. Then she went up to the bedroom and pre-
pared Sam’s clothes ready for his journey. She put
out his white shirt with the soft collar. His tie. His
dark suit. His black boots and bowler hat. She
hated having to touch them. She hated it still more
when he returned from the journey and, after airing
the dark suit, she had to put the clothes away again.
She couldn’t bear the look of Sam when he was
dressed in these particular clothes. In his gardening
ones he looked so much nicer; the blue shirt, open
at the neck, the old corduroy trousers, the stout
leather belt seemed so much more friendly-like than
the dark suit.
She packed his small Gladstone bag with all
he would need, not forgetting his gardening book,
which he always took on these occasions.
They ate in silence, as usual. She poured him
a strong cup of tea. She always wanted to ask him
what he was thinking about at these times, but she
never did, and he never even gave her the slightest
hint of what was going on behind his calm eyes.
Sam finished his meal and lit his pipe ; he gave
her a few instructions about the gardens. Would she
see that such-and-such a bed had plenty of water
after sunset? Would she have a look round for slugs
after dark?
Yes, she promised, she would.
Then he went up to the bedroom to change into
his town clothes.
SAM caught the four o’clock train. It was only a
local one and took him as far as the junction.
There were a few of his neighbors in the car-
riage. He would have preferred a carriage to him-
self, but it wouldn’t look well if he avoided his
friends.
Sam was well-liked, but was considered unsoci-
able and a bit dull. He didn’t drink. He rarely
visited the local pub, but when he did he was gener-
ous and ready to treat his friends to a mug of beer
while he himself drank ginger ale. He was always
ready to share round his tobacco or give away a few
vegetables and some fruit.
But gossip or talk about himself he refused to
do. No one got anything out of him in that way.
He would answer questions and give advice about


gardening, slowly and deliberately, and that was as
far as his conversational powers went.
One of his companions said: “All dressed up,
Sam? What is it this time: funeral or flower show?”
Sam grinned and stared out of the window but
made no answer. His stolid silence always had the
effect of silencing the questioner.
He drew out his old tobacco-pouch and handed
it round. His friends accepted a pipeful apiece and
left him to his own thoughts, talking among them-
selves.
At the junction Sam wished them a friendly
good-bye and, getting out of the train, went his way.
It was getting toward six o’clock when he
arrived. Outside the station he hailed a taxi, giving
the address of a hotel. Arrived there he paid off
the taxi and stood on the pavement watching it dis-
appear in the traffic.
Then he turned away, walking briskly, carrying
his small Gladstone bag. He passed through back
streets and took short cuts. He knew the way well
now, for he had made this journey eight times in the
last eleven years.
The first time he had come here he had felt
nervous and uncomfortable. Had not been able to
keep his thoughts from wandering and his imagi-
nation from harrowing him with queer visions. But
he wasn’t like that now. He had learned to shut his
thoughts off in a sort of watertight compartment and
anaesthetise his imagination.
He knew the routine now, and the formalities
through which he had to pass no longer made him
nervous or overanxious. Such duties as he had to
perform, he performed almost automatically, and
then went to the room assigned to him for the night.
He read for a while before settling down to
sleep. A faint smile touched his lips. “Funny, when
I first came here I lay awake all night”. . .
'T' HE morning dawned warm and fine. Sam, up and
‘ dressed, was led to the place where his work
must be done. His companions were waiting for
him and talked quietly with him of entirely irrelevant
subjects as with practised eye and hand he made
certain all was in order ; then he withdrew a little
from the group of fellow-beings, taking his cus-
tomary place, and stood there, his stolid face expres-
sionless, his mind empty, his nerves alert and ready
for action . . .
His ears were conscious of sounds and move-
ment, of quiet voices and slow footsteps, but he was
not actually listening to them.
He never allowed
himself to listen to such
things. He kept his
sense of hearing free
from every sound ex-
cept the one command
he waited for, the com-
mand that ordered him
to do the work for
which he was respon-
sible.
Somewhere a clock
struck eight.
The command
came. .
It was spoken very
quietly, very clearly,
and was for his ears
alone.
He was ready.
He obeyed the
command.
His work was
over . . .
CAM BULL-
—> THORP, in
his working
clothes again, sat
down to his mid-
day meal in the
cottage kitchen.
It was a good
meal, and he ate
it with appetite.
Ellen watched
him and waited
on him, but made
no attempt to
break the silence.
She poured
him another cup
of tea. He drank
thirstily. His
throat always felt curiously dry and tightened when
he returned from these journeys to town.
At last he finished and, giving a sigh of content-
ment, drew out his pipe and tobacco.
Ellen spoke then. Her voice was strained. “Did
it go off all right, Sam?” she asked.
“Yes, of course; it always does.”
“Yes, I know ; but this time it was different”. . .
Her voice dropped to a whisper and her eyes were
wide. “Sam, was she frightened?”
“I didn’t notice.”
Tears came into Ellen’s eyes. Tears were in
her voice as she went on: “Oh, Sam, it seems so
awful, so cruel . . . Why, she was only twenty-seven
and had little children and”
Sam got to his feet. His voice was harsh.
“That’ll do,” he said sternly. “We agreed you should
never ask me questions. It’s over and done with.
Her like have got to be exterminated.”
“But, Sam,” Ellen cried out with all her pent-up
feelings sounding in the cry, “it’s so terrible, so
frightening, to think it’s you that exterminates
them”. . .
“That’s my job,” and his voice softened. “Come
on out, Ellen, and help me get up them weeds in
the far bed —they’re just strangling them seedlings.
Come on, a bit of sunshine’ll do you good.”
A Sympathetic study:-
RETIRED
by "Percy Pawnticket"
EVERYBODY was making a great fuss about
Old Potter, but that did not prevent him from
feeling as if a knife had been plunged into his
heart and was still there.
“It’ll be a bit of a wrench at first, I daresay,”
Peterson had said, breaking the news to him. Peter-
son smiled in a kindly fashion. “It’s time you took
a spell and enjoyed your life, you know. You’ll be
able to give all your time to your hobbies.”
“He drank thirstily. His throat always felt
curiously dry and tightened when he
returned from these journeys .”
There was a grey sadness in Peterson’s smile as
if he were reflecting that it would not be so long before
he, too, manager as he was, would be retired —pushed
out, as Potter was, and compelled, like Potter, to
pretend that the future freedom was something to*
desire.
Potter remembered reading about human sacri-
fices to pagan gods who were honored and feted and
expected to regard death as a privilege. He was a
sacrifice now to the gods of Youth and Efficiency,
and he was expected to be glad.
Not until this morning had he realised that this
was the end. There was something unbelievable
about it. Something would happen to interfere with
the arranged plan. Carson would fall sick, perhaps ;
might be injured in a car smash.
He had clung to that fanciful dream even in
the train, when that stab-in-the-heart feeling became
almost unendurable. It came as a last consolation
when he reflected that this would be the end of the
discussions with his fellow-passengers—about gardens,
about poultry and stamps.
ARSON, however, was already at the office, look-
more than usually bright and alive. And
here was Potter “handing over,” taking a long time
over explanations, grudgingly letting go the strings
of his authority. The explanations were quite un-
necessary, but when they were finished Potter’s reign
definitely would have ended ; only the gathering of
the staff for a presentation would remain.
Detecting a repressed impatience in Carson, the
old man felt a surge of hatred. He had liked Carson ;
from the moment he arrived as a willing, eager youth
he had made a protege of him, and had been proud
of him almost as if he had been a son. He was still
“Young Carson” to him; it had come as a shock
when he heard junior members of the staff referring
to “Old Carson.”
The affection had become edged with bitterness
when he realised that Carson had been steadily,
quietly making himself conversant with all the secrets
which were Potter’s as accountant in the prospect
of stepping into his shoes. Explanations about the
private ledger even were unnecessary.
There was no doubt that Carson’s impatience
had hurried to-day’s climax. Carson had wanted
promotion ; there had been talk a few months before
that he was going to another firm where he could
secure the senior position without delay. Almost
certainly Wi n-
thorp and Mul-
lins had promised
Carson that he
should have Pot-
ter’s job, pre-
pared to sacrifice
the old man who
had only a few
more years of
usefulness rather
than lose the
younger one.
“It’s very
good of you,
Potter, to go so
thoroughly into
everything. I
think I’ve got the
hang of it all.” Potter felt
there might be veiled sar-
casm in the words.
“There’s a couple of
little matters still I think we’d
better discuss,” he said
vaguely, fighting for time.
“Well, by Jove,” said
Carson. “I’ll have a long
time to wait before I have a
chance of retiring and enjoy-
ing my life!”
Potter felt it hypocrisy.
Carson didn’t want retire-
ment and he knew Potter did
not want it.
“It’s something for me
to look forward to in the
future,” said Carson. “I can
see you enjoying yourself,
doing what you like, while
I’m slogging here in the
office.”
nro Potter there was a note
* of triumph. Carson was
in possession now.
“It’s a great thing for a
man to have hobbies,” he re-
marked. One made silly re-
marks like that. The prize-
fighter who had been beaten
shook hands with his oppo-
nent and said he was glad
the better man had won.
Convention demanded these
hypocrisies.
But his whole soul was in rebellion. He had
tried to assure himself for weeks that his hobbies
would absorb his interest. Half the interest of his
hobbies, however, had been in discussing them on the
train; the opportunity to display in the office choice
blooms from his garden which visitors would notice
and praise—things like that.
He wanted work—the knowledge that this or that
had, to be fixed up; something to give a purpose to
life. The hobbies would never provide a full purpose.
It was work that kept a man alive.
And he was being pushed out. Of course, he
might go on with that old idea of his, setting himself
up in an accountancy practice. It would help to
show them that he was not as old as they thought—
retiring him!
He had been a fool to give up the idea,
but the firm had induced him to abandon it —they
had wanted him then. Now they were casting him
aside.
It was surprising to think that ten years had
passed since that episode. Ten years! He had hardly
noticed the changes. Now he could do everything that

Atale of Man:-
THEMEASURED
STEPS
BY
E. MARY
CURNEY
DARIEN had no stamina. Donat had suspected
it from the first. When a gust of wind split
the kauri-tree sideways and it caught Kintry,
smashing him to pulp, Donat knew it.
Darien covered his face with his great hands,
and actually whimpered, but when Donat called that
Kintry was not dead, and that they would have to
take him out, ten miles down the bush track, Darien
pulled his belt up a hole and did what he was told,
efficiently and methodically.
Darien was a great slab of a man, with a bul-
lock’s strength and the simplicity of a child. A
silent, smiling giant, given to dreaming when there
was work to be done.
Lazy, Kintry had said, but Donat could not
agree. There was something about the fellow. Some-
thing likeable. And a lazy man never develops
muscle.
Darien bulged with it. His arms, under his
rolled sleeves, were white as a woman’s, and the
muscle rippled under the skin like satin; not knotted,
but iron hard and beautifully symmetrical. But
Kintry sneered. Kintry liked meat—and muscle-
in chunks.
Donat was frankly puzzled by Darien. For
hours at a time the giant would work with a bull-
headed energy that almost amounted to frenzy, the
sweat rolling off him in great beads, his axe rising
and falling with a rhythmic force that sent the white
chips flying ; and then, suddenly, he would be utterly
still on a fallen log, his great hands limp between
his knees and a queer, whitish pallor about his lips.
Donat asked him once if there was anything
wrong; at which Darien smiled and shook his head.
“Nothing that you could put a name to,” he
said non-committally.
Kintry did not like
him; his long silences
and his sudden lassi-
tude.
Kintry was bossing
the job in hand —cut-
ting out a clearing to
which the mill would
be shifted in the spring.
When three men
spend weeks on end
together, they need to
be normal, equable,
congenial and forbear-
ing, but Kintry was not.
A good bushman and
a good gang boss, he
had not the placidity
necessary for the boss-
ing of a slack-time job.
The habit of driving
was too deeply in-
grained in him; the
passion for getting on.
Always he worked
against time. He had
no time for those who
could not utilise their
heads to make money
with their hands, and
less time still for those
who were “different.”
Man worked and
ate, slept and mated,
and that was all there
was to it. Life was too
short to waste it sit-
ting on a tree trunk
watching things grow.
Slacking made a man
soft, and that was an
end to him. He began
by neglecting his work,
and finished by doing
no work at all.
Darien, he said.
was wasting his energy
working in spurts. A
man got more done
working steadily ; but
even Kintry, with the
hide and muscle of a
bull-elephant, could
not do more in a day.

As they stooped to lift Kintry clear of the tree,
it slipped off the jacks, and a branch caught Donat
on the elbow, smashing it. Dizzy with pain, he nearly

brought him round with whisky from the hip flask
tbat he always carried, but which Donat had never
seen him use.
While he bandaged Donat’s elbow, he whim-
pered, his breath coming unevenly, hissing between

dog’s chance anyway. Might as well die heie, in
peace.”
But Donat was stubbornly contemptuous.
“He’s got to have a dog’s chance!” said Donat
through clenched teeth.
A bleak look went over Darien’s face ; a dead
grey pallor that somehow reminded Donat of a
corpse. A look akin to fear but which was yet not
fear came into his eyes. When he shut them his lids
were a bloodless white in his brick-red face. His
tongue went round his lips; and then he looked
at Donat, but the look went through him and beyond
him, to infinite distances. The furtive, beaten look
gave place to adamant.
He turned away from Donat, going across the
clearing to the whare, walking deliberately, as though
he counted each step. With Donat’s fumbling aid,
he improvised a stretcher, and about all his move-
ments was that same calculated deliberation.
When they started on the ten-mile trek, Donat,
agony searing him, the foot of the stretcher slung
by ropes to his shoulders, was consumed by an
impatient anger against Darien, who moved like
an automaton, stepping with clocklike precision along
the track.
Once or twice, in the first miles, Donat attempted
to urge him to a faster pace, but Darien did not
seem to hear; and, as the hours passed, Donat,
walking in a daze of pain, himself began to fail.
Curiously, Darien seemed to know, wordlessly,
when the other was on the edge of collapse, and
paused to dose him with the scant supply of whisky.
Before they reached the railhead and the easier
going it entailed, Darien’s step, though still measured,
grew slower and slower; his feet dragged. Presently
he began to count aloud, whisperingly.
“One —two —three—four —five” on and on,
with unnerving monotony. Donat called to him, a
fierce muttering, and Darien broke off in his count-
ing, and stopped to hand him the flask.
Donat refused it.
“Take it yourself!” he said, muttering under his
breath, in a passion of futile impotence, “Yellow!
Yellow!”
BUT he knew that Darien was not yellow ; that in
some obscure way, past comprehending, he was
achieving untold heights.
After an eternity of time they reached the rail-
head, and Kintry began to moan. The sound of
it jerked Darien from his stumbling plodding, from
the monotony of his crazy counting. For the first
time he looked back, with stark terror in his eyes;
then he began to run, moving at a blundering jog-
trot that jarred Donat’s elbow past enduring.
He cried out, but Darien did not slacken pace —-
pounded on, head low, shoulders hunched forward,
like a driven horse. As he went, he muttered fever-
ishly, and Donat knew that he was counting still.
Steeling his will, Donat slogged on, whimpering
and cursing, but Darien was deaf and blind to every-

had to be done in a routine way ; but he had lost
the energy to go out for business, to build up some-
thing new. His opportunity to create a working-
place that could not be taken from him had passed.
ARSON had been whispering at the door, but
back to him.
“Will you come, Mr. Potter?” he said. “The
staff has a surprise for you.”
It wasn’t a surprise. It was merely the last act
of a tragical morning, planned for weeks.
Convention demanded that he should go to what
was to him the altar of sacrifice, and listen to the
adulatory speeches that were made about him, pre-
tend that he was pleased. He was really touched, too.
Perhaps he was more touched by the girl who, with
glistening eyes, sobbed, “Oh, Mr. Potter, I’m so sorry
you are leaving us—we are all sorry!” than by the
carefully-prepared phrases of the managing director
about his long service and the respect in which he
was held.
“I suppose we all envy him —life a perpetual holi-
day. But our dear friend Mr. Potter has earned the
enjoyment of his leisure as well as ever a man earned
it,” said the managing director, finishing amid volleys
of applause.
Carson had to have a word. “I only hope my
work will be found to have the same splendid perfec-
tion as the man who taught me all I know!”
“And you have repaid me by pushing me out!”
Potter thought. He was scrapheaped, done with —a
purposeless derelict.
He was aware that Peterson, beside him, was
addressing him in a quiet personal fashion.
“Potter,” he said, “you spoke to me some time
ago about a grandson of yours whom you expected
to pass the Leaving this year. The exam.’s over;
he’s sure to pass, isn’t he? If you like to bring him
along we can give him a start.”
“Thank you, Peterson,” he said eagerly.
Suddenly his mind was at peace. He could face
his retirement to his hobbies with a happy spirit. For
he saw a purpose handed to him. Even the intensity
of his resentment against Carson faded out; the feel-
ing for him was one almost of pity.
There was good stuff in young Brian ; he was
studious ; already he had shown great aptitude for
figures. He would train him, advise him, give him
knowledge that would make him the perfect
accountant.
Some day Carson would stand in the place in
which Potter had stood that morning; and the man
who would be in the place Carson had occupied would
be Brian! The desire to hit back at those who hurt
was still a satisfying human instinct.
thing but the necessity for getting Kintry to the
mill.
Donat had decreed it, driven him to it, and now
the thing should be done, though he died for it.
NT EITHER of them knew when Kintry stopped
* moaning.
lohnny Bands, caretaking while the mill was
closed down for the winter, heard them coming, and
came out in time to catch the stretcher from Darien
as he collapsed.
Donat, fumbling with the ropes at his shoulders,
laughed aloud before he, too, fainted.
“Chap . . . has . . . no . . . stamina,” mumbled
Donat, pityingly.
When he came round he was in bed in hospital.
“It was grand,” the doctor told him dryly, in-
specting his elbow, that was already set in plaster
of Paris. “Not many men could have done it . . .
brought two dead men ten miles over that track.”
“Two,” said Donat blankly.
The doctor nodded.
“Only the sheer will to live can have kept Darien
going,” he said definitely. “An ordinary man would
have been dead six months ago . . . Angina pectoris.
He must have been in agony.”
It was some seconds before Donat answered. “I
called him yellow. I said he had no stamina . . .
He counted every step ... to make them last until
the end.”
Doss YOUR Wife?:-
SYSTEM
BY
A.C. HEADLEY
ON Wednesday afternoons Mrs. Carnage enjoyed
herself. For one thing Carnage was at work,
and therefore not icily contemptuous of her
selections. On Wednesdays it made no differ-
ence if, responding to the unconscious tip of someone
in the back lane calling with strident urgency to Billy,
she backed Billy Boy. Not the slightest difference
either if she backed Sally after hearing a record play-
ing “You Oughter See Sally on Sunday.” But when
Carnage was there she could feel his aggrieved spirit,
and it helped destroy the comfortable complacency
of her afternoon.
“Women oughtn’t to be allowed to bet,” Carnage
had said on more than one occasion.
Carnage looked on betting as a sacred rite.
Every Thursday evening he bought two racing-form
papers, and with these and a pencil applied himself
to a forecasting of the future. His mind, taking a
vacation from its normal empty placidity, would
become a receptacle of furlongs, seconds and weights.
As far as Mrs. Carnage was concerned it was a
trancelike proceeding from which he would emerge
occasionally to demand how did she think a feller
could think if she was everlastingly fiddling around.
Then Saturday would come around and prove
that his forecasts had somehow lacked the essence
of truth. Not that Carnage was prepared to concede
that point. He had too firm an opinion of his judg-
ment. If his horse failed it was as dead as a door-
nail; if it led and was
pipped off at the finish it
was because the jockey
was riding it into the
ground. In whichever
case, Carnage aired the
announcement forcibly,
the connections ought to
be rubbed out for life.
Meanwhile his wife,
with startling frequency,
backed ten-to-one win-
ners. Whenever this hap-
pened gall and wormwood
were as milk and honey
compared with her hus-
band’s feelings.
It was not the fact
but the method of selec-
tion that angered him, and
in this his most withering
sarcasm was delivered at
the benighted individuals
at the radio station who
broadcast the records be-
tween races, for from here
came his wife’s most con-
sistent source of infor-
mation. Someone singing
opera was sufficient to
send her looking down the
lists for a horse with an
Italian name.
IT was the day Mrs.
' Carnage saw a starling
and backed The Raven,
which duly won, that
Carnage had his great
idea.
So it was, the follow-
ing Saturday, that up to
the last race Mrs. Carnage
had not backed a winner.
Things, felt Carnage, were
working out splendidly.
Possibly in a very short
while his wife would be
cured. It was so simple.
She had not connected the
fact that he had bought a
Bulletin the previous
evening to the fact that
she had backed a horse of
that name in the first
race ; nor her backing Gay
Blonde with the picture of
Mae West spread out be-
fore her on a magazine cover.
As the time for the last race approached,
Carnage, as casually as possible, said: “Pass me that
book off the piano, Dulcie.”
“Book! ” said Dulcie; “since when’ve you taken
to readin’ anything ’cept the form papers?”
“Feller lent it to me,” said Carnage briefly ; “said
it was a good book. Three Musketeers or something.
It was a picture a while back.”
“Musketeers,” said Mrs. Carnage speculatively;
“ain’t Musketeer startin’ in the last?”
“Garn,” said her husband deprecatingly, “you
couldn’t back that thing with peanuts.”
But he could see that the poison had done its
work. Mrs. Carnage took the bets down to the back
fence to wait for the bookie. Carnage looked at the
book in his hand and grinned complacently. Mus-
keteer wasn’t a chance in a hundred.
A COUPLE of minutes after his wife returned the
race had started. It was a mile, and Musketeer
jumped out at the start. At the half-mile he was
two lengths in front of everything. At the six he
still held the lead, and Mrs. Carnage was jumping
up and down in an ecstatic what-did-I-tell-you?
Carnage felt a trifle sick. They turned into the
straight. He heaved a sigh of relief. Something
else had taken the lead. Then Musketeer was plod-
ding along in third place. He held that position at
the finish.
It was that moment that Carnage chose to deliver
a homily on the fact of leaving the backing of race-
horses to chance.
“You’re mad,” he said, “to think you can pick
winners like that.”
“Mad! ” said Mrs. Carnage jubilantly; “I’m
waitin’ to see what it paid on the tote.”
“Tote?” said Carnage.
“Yeah, that was the tip. Three Musketeers.
Three, see —third. I toted it. It ought to pay a
pretty big dividend.”
“Jumping up and down in an ecstatic what-did-I-
tell-you?”

which they find themselves ; the limit reached, the
dream vanishes as the gates are shut. Delacy throws
the gates wide open for his peg-legged ghost under
his fool of a hat to ride thundering down Australian
history, the moind hand in hand with the hard, in-
domitable body.
He came out of a small, mild Irish habitation,
orderly, benevolent, ruled rectangularly back and
forth with static laws and traditions until its spirit
was like its hedged fields, its gentle cabins and cot-
tages. Australia lit him to a burning fire which swept
away laws and traditions, the toys that meant nothing
in these eternal hills and ghostly canyons, these end-
less horizons. Out of that narrow Irish vigilance he
became the embodiment of the Australian “fair go”
to white, yellow and black ;he became the reckless
Australian maker and thrower-away ;he became the
Australian gambler mocking to-morrow.
Soames Forsyte shows us the England of his
times —Ponderevo, Dawes, Jean Valjean, Madame
Bovary, Copperfield, Quixote: Danny Delacy joins
the august company. Using his eyes and his tireless
moind (which are made ours by his creator) we stand
under his enchanted hills by his vast shadowed gullies
and watch his Australia of yesterday, of to-day, of
to-morrow. Which is as high as the art of fictional
creation can go.
HILARY LOFTING.
"Our Lords and Masters."
“The world,” declares the first sentence of Out-
Lords and Masters, by “The Unofficial Observer”
(Robert Hale and Co. ; 15s. net), “is rushing down a
steep place into catastrophe.” It isn’t the author’s
declaration ; simply what—as everybody by now is
well enough aware —the “experts” tell us is the case.
The author is not so sure that the much-advertised
coming war must come, or even that it will come.
He is not in the prophecy business. His job is to
survey the general world scene and, especially, to
describe and analyse the men —divers of them off-
stage actors —whose leadership is matter for the
groundlings’ gaping or applause.
The book, an extended and well-written narrative
Who’s Who of world figures, is worth a sackful of
the propaganda works—nowadays mostly anti-Hitler
—which sausage out from the presses. The Unofficial
Observer has no discernible axe to grind. Of course,
he will be anathema to anti-Hitlers and pro-Stalins,
also to pro-Hitlers and anti-Stalins, and to all sorts
of others who take sides violently for this or that. His
aim is to take a look at all these varieties of leader-
ship, and dissect impartially. He admittedly writes
from the American national point of view, but judged
by the works of such of his countrymen .as John
Gunther that is anything but a disqualification. The
work is enlivened by an epigrammatic brand of
humor:
The British Empire, the greatest single organised
force for stability in the modern world, is a colossus
with feet of brass and a head of clay. Too many
nations have assumed the opposite—and where are
they?
Similarly his descriptions of politicians and poten-
tates :
That sulky genius [Hitler].
Pierre Laval spent the next few years acquiring an
interest in various provincial newspapers and altering
his political beliefs to correspond with what seemed to be
the taste of the times.
Also of Laval:
He belongs to a generation many of whose ablest
members lost their lives in the war, thus leaving
vacancies for some of their less competent survivors.
And of an ex-monarch:
Haile Silassie, Emperor of Abyssinia, King of
Kings, Conquering Lion of Judah, Elect of God and
Light of the World, weighs one hundred pounds.
The Unofficial Observer has confused notions of
Australian political institutions, and states —he wrote
a year or so ago—that under Mr. Lyons we have been
led to cultivate American goodwill. With the achieve-
ments of Mr. Gullett in mind that might be doubted,
but it might comfort many to have from even an
unofficial observer who is American the assurance that
There is little reason to doubt that a direct Japanese
assault on Australia would arouse American sympathy
and aid for the Commonwealth “down under.”
In this respect he says also:
Australia is a standing affront to every political
instinct in Japan. Here is a huge continent which could
accommodate much of Japan’s surplus population, which
is the lawful prey of any nation which enjoys naval
supremacy in the Pacific, and from which the “White
Australia” policy has excluded Japanese immigrants
while the white Australians crowd into a few cities in
the south and let the bulk of the continent lie fa110w....
Between Japan and this toothsome morsel there is only
one real obstacle: the British Navy, and if England
becomes absorbed in European conflicts or loses the
power to maintain her paramount naval defence then
Japan’s hour of destiny will have come.
And this is why we admire Mr. Lyons:
Known throughout Australia as Joe, he has no gifts
of oratory, but owes his popularity to his plain, blunt,
rugged character and his engaging smile. But above all
his prowess as a family man recommends him to a
nation that fears the growing population of Japan.
"The Need We Have."
Some years ago A. Hamilton Gibbs —brother of
Phillip Gibbs and Cosmo Hamilton —published a
novel, Soundings, which met with wide appreciation.
Followed four or five others, much less successful,
and now comes The Need We Have (Harrap;
Dymock’s; 7s. 6d.), an attempted return to the earlier
manner. While very readable, it is not completely
satisfactory to anyone who gives it close attention.
The trouble seems to be that Gibbs has added to his
experience of life since his first book without making
a corresponding development as a writer, and has
attempted in this, his latest, to escape back into his
earlier self, but without unburdening himself of his
accumulated sophistication.
The story, set in rural Ireland, concerns the
widow CPHara, who has a fixation on her son Jim,
and who is, in consequence, hostile to the young wife,
Moira, whom Jim brings to the cabin. Under her
influence Jim becomes morose, taking no delight in
his wife, only in his farm work and his rabbiting
dogs. Aided by Jim’s child brother, Dinny, and Tim
O’Shea, a young garage proprietor—a man whom she
might have married—Moira clears out. She and
Dinny take work with a doctor in a distant town.
O’Shea follows to press his suit. The doctor, helped
by the priest, sizes up the situation between the young
O’Haras and the mother and removes the old woman’s
fixation by charging her with it and convicting her
in her own judgment. O’Shea sells his garage and
goes to America.
The theme is susceptible of either simple or
profound treatment. Gibbs tries to give it both. It
is most successful where he is content with the sur-
face of his narrative. The home life of the O’Haras,
the picture of the old woman always ready to find
fault with Moira and putting ideas into Jim’s head,
Moira’s grief over the loss of Jim’s affection, her
bewilderment over the injustice of it and her turning
to Dinny’s friendship for consolation are all quite
effectively presented. The scene between Moira and
O’Shea in which it becomes clear —to the reader,
though not to the protagonists—that she is deaf to
his pleading is also good. But the writer is lost be-
tween a desire to deal sympathetically with his simple
folk and a fear of being caught on their mental level.
The book will go down best with those who take
it for the whiff of peat smoke in its pages and for that
touch of something akin to sentimentality that does
not seem to be out of place in tales of the Irish
cabinry.
Murdoch's Essays.
Lucid Intervals, by Walter Murdoch (Angus and
Robertson; 4s. 6d.), will do much to sustain its
author’s reputation as a writer who can toy gracefully
and amusingly with an idea for a few pages before
putting it down pretty much where he found it or,
alternatively, can be trusted to eschew controversial
topics. His last book, The Wild Planet, showed a
tendency toward a firm expression of views on matters
of importance; matters in which the reader was apt
to find himself strong in either agreement or disagree-
ment with the author. In Lucid Intervals these topics
have either been avoided or very lightly touched upon.
Murdoch is once again the amiable essayist.
It is true he thinks, among other things, that the
Russian social experiment is interesting and deserving
of our earnest attention, that war, which is scarcely
a credit to an enlightened humanity, is the product
of fear, that a dictatorship indicates some abject
quality in the minds of those who submit to it, that
every new accession of knowledge makes us look at
the Christian religion with new eyes, and that civilisa-
tion in its capacity for material expansion without
a corresponding increase of capacity for intellectual
and moral control seems to be developing the body
of a hippopotamus with the mind of a mouse. But
these are not opinions with which many will disagree.
Most of them are widely held. If there should be
a reader who objects to any of them he will find
them so mildly presented that it will be easy to laugh
with the author and pass on.
Reviewed Briefly.
FICTION . . .
Ballet Shoes: Noel Streatfield (Dent; 65.). The
theatrical and family life of Posy, Pauline and
Petrova, three child dancers. One of those stories
about children that have an attraction for the sensi-
tive adult mind because the author can enter into her
subject and yet exhibit a secret sense of humor and
grown-up understanding.
The Standard: Alexander Lernet-Holenia (Heine-
mann ; 7s. 6d.). Translated from the German by Allan
Harris. Dashing uniforms, intrigue, passionate love
and patriotism in Belgrade after the fall of the Haps-
burgs. A well-woven bit of light melodrama.
No Fixed Abode: Mrs. Stanley Wrench (Robert
Hale and Co.; 7s. 6d.). Enoch Arden plot. Central
figure is the half-gipsy Robina Gregory, who, after
a hundred pages or so of soul-torments, marries one
of Kitchener’s recruits. He fades out of the picture
“missing, believed killed,” only to turn up again 18
years later when Robina has met her true soul-mate.
The returnee shows his commonsense by leaving her
to it.
Randy of Roaring River: Frank C. Robertson
(Wild West Club ; 7s. 6d.). When politics impinge
on a sheep-cattle feud between rival ranches cow-
boys of each outfit drop their knitting needles and
reach for long-disused pearl-handleds. Boom in lead
industry before justice triumphs, a girl is won and
hero’s escapes from a sticky end has a, hair’s-breadth
working overtime.
Sowing Moon: Marion J. Farquhar (Geoffrey
Bles, Ltd.; 7s. 6d.). Scene is Paraguay, main char-
acters two Englishmen, brothers, and two Indo-Spanish
half-caste girls. Luisa is the best-limned study of
the South American Indian character this commen-
tator has struck. With the best of intentions she
poisons several people who seem to her to be better
dead. Her sister Casilda, more Spanish, and under-
standable in any language, is also well-drawn and
commands sympathy, but there is no mawkish bid
for it.
Three Sheets in the Wind: Guy Gilpatrick (The
Bodley Head ; 7s. 6d.). Farce among the Scottish
engine-room staff of an ocean-going vessel. Depends
for its humor on dialect and the amount of liquor
consumed.
BIOGRAPHY . . .
Captain Cook: Vice-Admiral Gordon Campbell,
V.C., D.S.O. (Hodder and Stoughton; Dymock’s;
155.). Cook is herb to his biographer, “the supreme
navigator of the eighteenth century, and perhaps of
all time.” The author’s style is clear, he has a flair
for the most interesting aspect of events, the book is
well indexed, there is a complete list of the logs,
journals, etc., surrendered by persons who accom-
panied the navigator, the illustrations are well chosen
and, most admirable feature, on an inserted map and
the two end papers are plotted the courses of Cook’s
three major voyages.
James Lyell Mackay, First Earl of Inchcape:
Hector Bolitho (James Murray, Ltd.). Conventional
biography of a “normal phlegmatic Briton, whose
life was successful from the beginning almost to the
end,” hard to write because Mackay used the tele-
phone and kept no diaries. Made millions out of
shipping and assisted Governments because the dis-
tinction of being a plenipotentiary pleased his pride.
Sold 418 enemy vessels after the war by private treaty
for £20,000,000 at a cost of 2s. Bd. per £lOO, and
afterwards realised it would have been better to have
sunk the lot.
Pools on the Glowing Sand: Irene V. Cleverdon
(Robertson and Mullins; 55.). Short biography of
Dr. Karl Kumm, missionary, author, explorer,
geographer and founder of the Sudan United Mission.
A pious and eulogistic tribute.
CRIME AND DETECTION . . .
The Test Match Murder: Denzil Batchelor
(Angus and Robertson ; 65.). Opens well: English
cricketer, hope of his side, walks out to the wicket
to save the ashes and falls dead. The chase for the
murderer leads through a music-hall used as a cloak
by dope pedlars, through one of those sinister opium-
dens in Sydney’s Campbell-street, presided over by a
Chinese master-criminal, to the gates of Long Bay
prison and thence to the summit of the Harbor
Bridge. No hero, no heroine, no romance in the
moonlight. Instead, an occasional whilf of derision
which spares not the intrepid detective-inspector nor
the highly superior English amateur sleuth who abets
his efforts. Better-written than the average.
TRAVEL . . .
Gone Sunwards: Cecil Roberts (Hodder and
Stoughton ; Dymock’s; 7s. 6d.). Takes a while to
get headed for the sunwards scene—-which is Florida
—but it’s pleasantly done, lightly skimming travelling,
which can be recommended to anyone who likes
light conversation. Pages in color and other illus-
trations add to its attractiveness.
GENERAL . . .
The Science and Sensation of Vocal Tone:
E. Herbert-Csesari (Dent; 10s. 6d. net). Painstaking
and conscientious attempt to elucidate by the written
word and multifarious diagrams the principles of the
Old Italian school of singing—those principles handed
down by Pope Gregory’s Schola Cantorum. It is a
difficult literary task —a bit like trying to describe
the sensations of a person eating a peach, but such
exalted authorities as Dinh Gilly, Tetrazzini, Gigli
and Joseph Hislop have hailed the book with cries
of joy There is nothing to approach it for thorough-
ness and clearness in the previous literature of the
kind.
In Praise of Dogs (Country Life ; 12s. 6d. net).
An anthology that will get dog-lovers by the short
hairs. Editor C. M. Harnett has got together a happy
lot of prose and verse praise by many writers, and
the G. Vernon Stokes illustrations are up to the high
standard of Country Life publications.
In the Steps of St. Paul: H. V. Morton (Rich
and Cowan; from Angus and Robertson; 11s. 3d.).
With In the Steps of the Master the author struck
a goldmine, an oilfield and a Wotan rolled into one,
and the present book, packed tight with informative
travel and biblical lore conveyed in his graceful con-
versational style and finely illustrated, is as good as
certain to have a vast sale. Morton blends past and
present most ingeniously, and has the faculty for
bringing both living and historical people alive on
the page. He is what a travel-author needs to be,
extremely good company. A band round the jacket
announces: “First Printing, 200,000 copies”—an
extraordinary figure.
A Bird in the Bush: E. Hilton Young (Lord
Kennet), illustrated by Peter Scott (Country Life;
10s. 6d. net). Pleasant essays of amateur bird-watch-
ing in England, with a colored frontispiece and many
accurate black-and-whites.
“Virgule”: London “Literary Guide” notes that
even the “Times Literary Supplement” is adopting
the innovation of omitting the comma in the second
instance where three nouns appear, prefaced in the
last instance by “and.” Thus:
There are essays on such topics as gambling, holidays
and trousers.
The “Guide” comments: “Is the reader to under-
stand that there are two topics, or are three intended?”
Ambiguity may possibly arise in some such cases —
I should say in very few —but I hardly think that any
intelligent reader of the “Times” sentence would
understand “gambling, holidays and trousers” to mean
anything but three subjects. The Bulletin has long
followed the practice of omitting the comma in such
cases, and I have never heard of any puzzled or infuri-
ated reader writing to the editor to ask politely or
demand savagely what was meant by a sentence so
“offending.” The comma before “and” seems to me
both a superfluity and an eye-irritant.

JAMES II. AND EDWARD VIII.
Some of the silliest speeches of the closing year—a
year in which an excited and alarmed world was
sorely in need of sage guidance—were made by
leaders of the Church of England.
The liars of the League press had no more
credulous reader than the Archbishop of Canterbury,
nor did anyone talk wilder nonsense about the
nobility of going to war to stop war —with, of course,
the whole-hearted assistance of the French, Belgians,
Portuguese, Spaniards, Mexicans and other peoples
devoted to “collective security.”
Even while Haile Silassie was bolting with his
gold, the Archbishop of Canterbury denounced “the
impotence of Christian Europe while professedly
Christian people use every barbarity in the name of
civilisation.” His brother of York said: “If the effec-
tiveness of the Covenant demands the employment
of armed forces we should be prepared to use them.”
The Bishop of Liverpool wrote: “In this case a
Christian nation must be prepared to use naval and
military force against aggression.”
War with another great military nation was
visioned by the Bishop of Durham. At a church
assembly in London, with “gaitered bishops, elderly
clergymen and curates shouting applause,” this bishop
thundered against “the foul and mean persecution of
the Jewish race in Germany,” which “makes me blind
with rage. Would that we could draw the sword and
go and do battle for God’s people”!
Foolish and dangerous as these utterances were,
they were not devoid of a muddle-headed chivalry.
There was no chivalry—not the faintest spark of
generous feeling—in the references of some Church
of England grandees to Edward the Eighth, their
pride and joy for four decades, when he had given
up the throne and gone into voluntary exile.
Said the Dean of Exeter in a sermon: “The
Church is relieved and happy at the passing of a
scandal.” “Relieved” the Church may be ; whether
it has a right to feel “happy” at the total failure of
its influence over and the severing of all its relations
with the late Defender of the Faith may be ques-
tioned. More especially as it said nothing about the
“scandal” and let the Defender of the Faith have
his fling until he had divested himself of all his
offices and become a remote and forlorn Duke.
The Bishop of Portsmouth preached from a text
in Paul’s First Epistle to the Corinthians, “It is re-
quired in stewards that a man be found faithful.”
But it is surely part of the requirement that stewards
should give faithful counsel when such is needed.
And the apostle wrote also in Ist Corinthians “Judge
nothing before the time until the Lord come” (v),
and “Now ye are full, now ye are rich” (viii), and
“Some are puffed up” (xviii). The bishop permitted
himself to judge “recent untoward events” and the
principal actor in them:
Men are crying out that the punishment is deserved,
that there is no place in the heart and no pity in the
marrow for the fugitive from the throne.
We should not say that we have no forgiveness, when
we recall the solitary figure looking back in the darkness
on England, for assuredly to him was made the promise
given to the prodigal son.
Prodigal son! Scarcely an appropriate illustra-
tion nor —considering the relation in which the
bishop stood for so many years “to the fugitive from
the throne” —at all charitable.
The Archbishop of Canterbury discharged him-
self of his censure in “a religious service broadcast
by the 8.8. C.” His Grace referred twice to “the
motive” that actuated the late sovereign, one of whose
prerogatives was “the choosing and appointing of all
archbishops, bishops and high ecclesiastical digni-
taries.” “The motive” was matrimony.
His Majesty wanted to marry the woman. Cer-
tainly the parties were not free to marry when their
design became known, and they could not have been
married in the Established Church even with the legal
impediment removed, nor could a twice-divorced
lady with two husbands in England have been accepted
as queen. But plain people give King Edward
credit for proposing a legal marriage instead of “liv-
ing in sin,” as did the fourth George and the fourth
William. Not so the Archbishop of Canterbury:
It is sad that for such a motive Edward the Eighth
abandoned a trust so great and sought happiness in
a manner inconsistent with Christian principles—
marriage within a social circle whose standards and
ways of lire are alien to all the best traditions of his
people. Members of that circle stand rebuked by the
judgment of the nation.
They were never rebuked by the Archbishop or
by any other moralist with a mitre when rebuke might
have had some effect.
Invincibly complacent, his Grace of Canterbury
“directed attention to a coincidence.”
On December 11 James the Second fled from White-
hall, and on December 11 Edward the Eighth left
Windsor Castle for exile in the darkness.
This “directs attention” to other “coincidences,”
and to the fact that James, though he renounced the
Church of England and tried to overthrow it and
rewarded Jeffreys for the legalised butchery of the
poor Church of England men who had followed
Monmouth, and though he tried to wade back to the
throne through more slaughter, was treated by
leaders of the Church of England—even by those he
persecuted—with immeasurably greater consideration
than mild little Edward the Eighth has received.
James ascended the throne on February 16, 1685.
He had declared himself a Catholic in 1672. While
still a son of the Church of England, he married Anne
Hyde “in discreditable circumstances.” Anne brought
him eight children, Mary of Modena seven more,
Arabella Churchill another three; and Catherine
Sedley made the score 19. “Before and after his
marriage he was a libertine.”
But his libertinism did not cost him the favor
of the Established Church. That he lost only when he
abused what he called his dispensing power. Catholics
and Dissenters were excluded from public employ-
ment by virtue of the Test Act. One of those perverse
persons who choose wrong ways even when they are
minded to do right things, he published a Declaration
of Indulgence cancelling the disqualification and
ordered the clergy, by proclamation, to read it from
their pulpits. Sancroft, the Archbishop of Canter-
bury, wrote a petition against the reading, and for
this he and six bishops who signed it were committed
to the Tower. Tried for libel, they were acquitted ;
and within seven months James had been chased off
his throne.
But many Church of England dignatories and
most of the Scottish clergy stuck to his cause. Hold-
ing themselves bound by the doctrine of non-resistance
to established authority, five of “the seven bishops,”
headed by Sancroft, refused to take the oath of
allegiance to William and Mary, and when William
deprived them of their sees they carried on in private
chapels. There were nonjurors in Scotland till 1788
and in England till the nineteenth century. The last
nonjuror is believed to have died in 1875.
Arabella Churchill was John Churchill’s eldest
sister. When she presented James with the son who
was to become Duke of Berwick, her brother had a
commission in the Guards. Made Baron Churchill
by James, and major-general, he beat Monmouth at
Sedgmoor; and the landing of William found him
lieutenant-general. He deserted to the Dutchman
with 5000 men, and five months later was Earl of
Marlborough.
Another Churchill figured in the scenes that
closed the eighth Edward’s public career. He shared
the King’s last meal at Fort Belvedere, and probably
wrote or revised the farewell speech broadcast from
Windsor Castle. In that Edward blamed nobody, and
spoke well of everybody whom it occurred to him to
mention. There is not the slightest reason to fear that
his future conduct will in the remotest degree resemble
that of James the Second. People like the poor
workless Welsh folk whom he visited before the
“scandal” burst, and to whom he brought comfort
and hope, are entitled to feel that he deserted them,
but comfortable clergymen of the Established Church
have no right to reproach him. Their privileges and
emoluments he never threatened, and they remain
unimpaired.
The exile’s last words to the people were “God
save the King.” Yes; and God send King George
wiser, braver and more charitable counsellors than
King Edward had!
"A Very Full Programme. "
One man in Australia is sure it is the best of all
countries and has the best of all Governments and
is entering upon the best of all Christmas seasons.
He is Mr. Joseph Aloysius Lyons, the Prime Minister.
Mr. Lyons reports that in 1936 his Government
“submitted a very full programme of work,” and
that “notwithstanding the intrusion of important new
issues not envisaged in the beginning very little of
that programme was not realised.” For “work”
read talk.
The House met on March 9 after the usual
beginning-of-December “Christmas” adjournment. It
sat for seven days in March, for four days in April
and for nine days in May. The principal achievement
of this “session” down to the last day was the con-
demning to death of the protective duty on cement,
though to silence easily-silenced objectors the Govern-
ment agreed to suspend the execution of the sentence
till December 1. The Tariff Board, it said, had
recommended the abolition of the duty and “tariff-
making, after public inquiry through the Tariff Board
and not by arbitrary Ministerial action,” was Govern-
ment policy, placed before the people at two elections
and by them endorsed
Then on May 22, just as the House was about
to rise, wholesale restrictions on Japanese and U.S.
imports, complicated by a licensing “system,” were
announced. They were, in effect, introduced by arbi-
trary Ministerial action without a public inquiry and
without consultation with Parliament.
In July, while legislators were convalescing after
their labors, the Privy Council delivered its judgment
in the James case. Rejecting the arguments of the
Commonwealth Attorney-General and his mate from
N. S. Wales, the Law Lords said, in effect: “Inter-
State Freetrade is no dead thing, the Section of the
Constitution which gave life to it means what it says,
and what you call your ‘orderly-marketing’ legislation
is unlawful.” Costs? They will make a huge hole
in £20,000 ; and the issue of damages remains.
By September the Government had sufficiently
recovered from the shock to begin “work” again. It
produced a Budget and some trade treaties—one with
a somewhat precarious republic which buys a bit of
Australian wool and “other commodities,” a twelve-
month’s purchases of “other commodities” amounting
to rather less than a senior typist’s wage for a year.
But it achieved no treaties with Japan or the United
States. Its trade wars with these countries, which
together bought £20,000,000 worth of Australian
produce in 1935-36, are still on.
With the Japanese out of the Australian market
Bradford and the Continent have been getting Aus-
tralian wool at least 3d. per pound cheaper than
they otherwise would have got it. With the
Japanese in other markets Argentinos, Afrikanders
and Maorilanders have benefited enormously: the
latest Maoriland report shows a vast advance in
price: £l4 16s. lid. a bale in December, 1935 (and
28,000 bales were sold); £25 a bale in December,
1936. Australians are expected to rejoice when their
superior wool fetches £2O a bale.
According to the Commonwealth Bank Board
an excess of exports equivalent to £23,000,000 ster-
ling is needed to meet external interest on “Common-
wealth and local authorities’ debts.” Last year the
excess was a million short of requirements, and the
board reported on June 30 that “London funds are
not sufficiently high to provide an adequate reserve
against adverse circumstances.” At the end of four
months of the present year value of imports exceeded
value of exports by £422,000. Another effect of
“trade-diversion,” no doubt.
Two Commonwealth loans floated during the
year were failures. In the recent case £7,500,000 was
asked for and £5,509,000 was subscribed. Very little
of the money raised is for the service of the Govern-
ment at Canberra—though, with £2,500,000 to
£3,000,000 of annual profits to play with, the fruits
of that unutterable anachronism tuppenny postage, it
is actually spending loan money in the P.M.G.’s
department—but the Government at Canberra has not
courage enough to tell loan-drunk provincial
Premiers that borrowing for crazy “works” like the
Sutherland-Cronulla and Maryvale-Sandy Hollow rail-
ways must cease.
“Sanctions” was another fiasco, although the
people were assured that it must succeed. What it
cost in loss of trade and maintenance of two cruisers
in the Mediterranean for many months has not been
revealed.
And the Government failed to deal with the
report of the Petrol Commission and with the
Pacific shipping question. When it “adjourned for
Christmas” a useless and expensive Banking Com-
mission was still dragging its comic-opera inquiry to
futility. The “vast increase in expenditure on defence”
leaves Australia without a single machine-gun bat-
talion or one up-to-date fighting aeroplane. After
two years of negotiations there is no air-mail agree-
ment with the British.
The Government has left the pearling industry at
the mercy of marauders. Its control of civil aviation has
crashed like its marketing schemes, and for much the
same reason —the High Court ruled that it had
exceeded its constitutional powers. Beyond scattering
a bit of largesse here and there, it has done nothing
for the unemployed. The plight of the States cries
aloud for a new financial arrangement that will admit
of their paying their way, and it must necessarily be
combined with transfer of powers and simplification
of taxes; but the job is too big for this Government.
This Government just shirks it.
The last item on the “very full programme of
works” —or perhaps it is to be included among “the
important new issues not envisaged at the beginning
of the session” —was the exclusion of Mrs. Freer as
“an undesirable character.” The act of a Minister
who refused to produce his “evidence” when chal-
lenged, and who, as it transpired, appealed for “cor-
roboration” to a person who has had unfortunate
relations with the police, it was supported by the
Government over the protests of two Ministers and
the entire Ministerial press, the latter expressed in
the language of utter contempt; then business was
scamped and members were dismissed so that Parlia-
ment might not be sitting when the victimised woman
returned to Australia.
So ended “the year of achievement.” Austra-
lians hope they will never see another like it, or
another Government like Mr. Lyons’s.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Mrs. Simpson Blameless.
Queensland’s Premier-Treasurer Forgan Smith, a
shining light at Loan Council meetings, is disposed
to attribute the failure of the December loan to “the
crisis.” He assumes that Australian citizens with
capital available were scared to invest in new Gov-
ernment securities because of their anxiety concern-
ing the late King, the throne and the American lady
with a partiality for changes in husbands. There
was no such “crisis” in June, when another loan met
with an inadequate response. People then were not
discussing-—in Australia, at all events —the matter of
flirtations in high places, nor aware of them.
“The crisis” had much less influence on the
December flotation than the inexorable logic of facts.
The Loan Council asked for more than the market
could “absorb”—on the prospectus conditions. Some
of the potential lenders, too, may have been informing
their minds. They have perhaps become acquainted
with the fact that the more money the Governments
get the more they spend unwisely.
In five years to June, 1935, the loss on the debts
of the States, according to the Commonwealth Grants
Commission’s reckoning the difference between
service charges and earnings of loan works and
services—amounted to just short of £109,000,000.
Towards this Queensland contributed nearly
£18,000,000.
Obviously, loan shortages in such conditions may
be reasonably welcomed rather than fretted over,
while there is a more tangible reason for them than
“the crisis.”
It isn’t fair to blame Mrs. Simpson for everything.

"Going to Marry Mrs. Simpson."
Maurice Blackburn, M.P., to The Bulletin:
May I respectfully deny the validity of one of the reasons
which you gave (B. 9/12/’36) for concluding that the marriage
of the then King with Mrs. Simpson was “out of the question.”
It appears that Mrs. Simpson has been divorced by
the Court of her domicile and that, in due course, the former
marriage will be legally and finally dissolved. Such a dissolu-
tion is recognised by the law of England in which country
Mrs. Simpson will be free to marry again. There would have
been nothing to prevent her marriage in the Church of England,
nor would there be any justification or excuse for the refusal
of any clergyman to celebrate the marriage.
The Episcopalian Church in Scotland and the overseas
Anglican churches are voluntary associations, making rules-
for their own members only. But the Church of England, in
England, is an established church ruled “by and in accordance
with the statutes of the realm.” When judicial divorce—
instead of divorce by Act of Parliament —was made law in
1857, by a bill for whose second reading 10 out of 15 bishops
voted, it was provided that, as soon as the decree was made
absolute, either of the parties might marry again as if the mar-
riage had been dissolved by death. Protection was given to
those clergymen whose conscience might be offended by the
change. No clergyman of the Church of England was to be
compelled to solemnise the marriage of any person whose
former marriage has been dissolved on the ground of his or
her adultery. [Section 57 of the Matrimonial Causes Act
1857, now part of Section 184 of the Supreme Court of
Judicature (Consolidating) Act 1925.] But by Section 58,
now part of the just-quoted consolidating section, the object-
ing clergyman was compelled to permit his parish church to
be used for the marriage if another clergyman was willing
to solemnise it.
But no objection could be taken by a clergyman to the
marriage, in his own parish church and by himself, of an
innocent party to a divorce. Before the Divorce Royal Com-
mission of 1912 the Bishop of St. Albans gave evidence in
favor of his own claim for more protection to an objecting
clergyman. He stated his objection to the remarriage in
England by a clergyman of a person divorced abroad for a
cause not recognised by English law, and asked the commission
to recommend an alteration of the law so as to protect a
refusing clergyman where the divorce had been granted on
grounds which his conscience thought objectionable. He did
pot ask that clergymen should be forbidden to solemnise a
marriage where one party —or both—had been divorced for a
cause not recognised by English law.
The commission, in very general terms, recommended an
increased protection to the conscientious objector, as to English
divorces as well as foreign divorces. But they added the follow-
ing significant clause:
“525. —At the same time whatever protection or measure
of liberty may be provided for those who maintain the objec-
tions aforesaid, it must be remembered that there are others,
both clergy and laity, who do not support them, and we think
that freedom of opinion and action should be preserved to
them.”
No alteration was made in the law. Mr. A. B. Kempe,
chancellor of the diocese of St. Albans, in advising his bishop,
thus stated it:
“No distinction can legally be drawn between the law of
England and the law of the Church of England, and it would
be impossible to contend that Mr. C.D. in marrying A. 8.,
a single man entitled by the law of England to be married
here, had violated the law and laid himself open to ecclesi-
astical censure. Technically speaking, I think that C.D.”
(the vicar) “was bound to celebrate this marriage” (A.B. had
obtained a foreign divorce for incompatibility).
Mr. Blackburn’s very interesting letter was written
before the abdication ; The Bulletin has taken the
liberty of changing the tense of verbs here and there.
The late King’s legal right to marry when the lady is
free to marry was not disputed ; the suggestion was
that he would find it impossible to get the ceremony
performed by a clergyman of a church everywhere
opposed to divorce. This difficulty remains, and an-
other difficulty may have been created by the late
King’s communications to the Prime Minister' in
October and November, particularly the “I-am-going-
to-marry-Mrs. Simpson” declaration. There may have
to be a foreign marriage.
The N.S.W. Police Commission.
Famous remarks of N. S. Wales Police Commissioner
Mackay, known to the Labor party before Mr. Lang
recognised his merits in 1931-32 as “The Flying
Scotsman”: —<
I thought it a sacred thing that Mr. Lang should
open the Bridge.
Our State police force is as efficient as any in the
world.
The second observation was uttered on “The
Flying Scotsman’s” return from an exceedingly long
flight through foreign countries, during which 18
members of the force were dismissed for “unsatisfac-
tory conduct” ; 22 others were suspended (most of
them have since been dismissed) in consequence of
the Royal Commissioner’s report on s.p. betting cases
in which they were concerned; three were cast in
damages for what a jury held to be assault on a man
illegally arrested, and two others for killing a foot-
passenger while travelling in a police car driving at
great speed.
The Stevens Government appointed Mr. Mackay
and gave him powers equivalent to those it has
bestowed on its other commissions, which have
become virtually independent of Parliament. It
contrived to avoid a debate on police administration
before it “adjourned for Christmas,” but it will not
always be so successful.
One of the Neglected Ports.
Albany (W.A.) is a charming place with a delightful
climate, a noble deep-water harbor and good land
not far away. It had its great moment in November,
1914, when the A.N.Z.A.C. transports and their con-
voys gathered there for the voyage that was to make
history; but it was neglected before and has been
neglected since—neglected by Perth politicians for
manufactured ports on the west coast.
Pleading its cause in Westralian Assembly,
L. L. Hill, the member for Albany, said that, although
loan expenditure on ports amounted to £6,660,000
out of a total State debt of £90,000,000, not a cent
had been spent on Albany since 1922. Once Albany
had more trade than Fremantle; in 1934-35
Fremantle’s share of Westralia’s trade was 88 p.c.
At Albany we have 33 feet of water and are right
on the trade routes. Even with these advantages we have
trouble in getting ships. Nature made the harbor at
Albany, and made easy grades right through to Merredin
and Southern Cross. Nature omitted to provide a
harbor at Bunbury, and put a range of hills between our
western coast and the wheat belt. The high percentage
of trade going through Fremantle is one of the main
causes of a disproportionate growth of the metropolitan
area.
Albany is not alone in its misery. Sydney Govern-
ments still adhere to the One Big Port policy. It
leads to an over-concentration of population, which
is difficult to provide for in bad times and will be
desperately hard to defend if Australia is ever invaded.
Development of and diversion of population to
neglected deep-water-port districts should be among
the depression measures ; but it is too big a task for
parish-minded politicians, and of these Australia has
a multitude. The seven-Parliament system breeds
them.
Endowment of—Members.
The increase in pay of Queensland members from
£5OO to £650 a year—authorised in December, it dates
from July I—is in no sense a restoration of emergency
depression cuts. This matter of politicians’ pay has a
rather inelegant history.
In 1926 the McCormack Government went to the
polls with a programme headed by child endowment.
Not one word or syllable was said about the pay of
members. Labor having been returned to power, child
endowment was forgotten, and the first legislation
passed by the new Parliament gave members an addi-
tional £5 a week. For many years the successful party
had apparently been content with £5OO a year.
Morally every Labor member had asked for his job
at the old remuneration and got it.
Possibly, if not probably, this grab contributed to
the defeat of the Labor Government in 1929. Mr.
Moore was made Premier on the definite understand-
ing that he would restore the pay to the old figure—•
which he did as soon as the Parliament met. The
depression may therefore be ruled out of the area of
fair discussion.
The estimated deficit for the current year is
£650,664. The party in power has added £7300 to
the assumed shortage. This, of course, is a form of
child endowment, because deficits are added to the
public debt which the children of to-day will have to
support when they grow up to privileged citizenship. '
Air Force Efficiency.
In the affair of the young R.A.A.F. weather pilot who
was lost and found on the lonely, bush-clad Brisbane
Ranges, near Bacchus Marsh (Vic.), the Laverton
officers and men lived up to the best traditions of
the R.A.F.
Pilot-officer E. V. Read took off at 8.15 a.m. on
Monday, December 14, to collect daily weather data
at 16,000 ft. The job usually takes 45 minutes, but
conditions were bad, and Laverton did not worry until
he had been in the air more than an hour. Nine
’planes then set off in a fruitless attempt to guide him
home. Later in the day radio stations and newspapers
appealed for information ; broadcasts were continued
at night to catch farmers home from work.
The reports that poured in from all parts of
Victoria had to be sorted and checked by Laverton,
but early on the Tuesday service machines were con-
centrating on the Bacchus Marsh district. By mid-
day Read had been sighted from the air, trapped in
wreckage lying on an isolated hill so inaccessible that
it was another four hours before a ground party
reached the badly-injured flier. That party—as in the
case of the alpinists lost earlier in the year on the
Bogongs—comprised men who had left their jobs
to join the search.
Laverton tackled its difficult location task with
an efficient coolness that certainly saved a pilot pinned
in his cockpit for 31 hours; the pilot himself, after
scratching regular messages on the fuselage of his
machine, bore dreadful injuries with the fortitude of
the service during the passage through rough country
to a waiting ambulance.
Despite criticism by the stunt press, the R.A.A.F.
made the best of a set of unfortunate circumstances
rendered worse by weather that ruled out any effective
air search on the Monday.
The Eruption of J. i. Martin.
After the election of Mr. Ted Grayndler to the
N.S.W. Leg. Council vacancy caused by the death of
Mr. Jack Higgins, Mr. J. B. Martin, one of Mr. Lang’s
right-hand men, pronounced it “corrupt.” He quoted
“S. M. Herald” as saying that the Country party had
quietly organised in Mr. Grayndler’s interest, though
he is general secretary of the Australian Workers’
Union.
The outcome of the philippic was that the Gov-
ernment —in the words of Mr. Martin —committed
the “dastardly act of appointing a select committee
... to put me on the spot.” He moved an amendment
that the inquiry should include “investigation of the
circumstances and methods relating to the conduct
of the general-election ballot of 1933 and also to any
allegation of improper conduct in regard to an elec-
tion of a member to the Legislative Council.”
The inquiry was held. Mr. Martin did not give
evidence, but was represented by counsel. The select
committee refused to go into a story of how one
honorable member had “punched another member in
the eye,” but all the charges deemed to be pertinent—
that the election was “corrupt,” that it was the result
of a “conspiracy,” “that £2OO is the price of election
to the Leg. Council” —it dismissed as “untrue.”
At the beginning of the week it was pleasingly
Uncertain—the pleasure was not universal—whether
the House would chide Mr. Martin or chuck him out.
Advice to on Immigrant.
Young Canadian, to arrive in Australia next year,
would appreciate a letter giving instruction and advice
from an Australian (Bulletin Service Department,
9/12/ ’36).
“G.D.” steps forward:
Don’t think of coming to Australia unless you have a
working knowledge of several current languages. Brush up
your French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Gaelic and
Italian, and renew your contact with Hindustani, Urdu, Tamil,
Telugu, Canarese and Malayalam.
When you have sufficient knowledge of these languages to
be able to take down a short dictation test in any one of
them, you may approach our hospitable shores with far less
trepidation than if you were unequipped in this way.
Be circumspect in your general demeanor while on board
ship. Should your conduct appear even slightly irregular,
there might be difficulties about your landing. Don’t on any
account speak to any female, for the very funnels have ears.
And you must be careful never to appear in public in
any form of undress, such as shorts. Better wear neck-to-
ankle costume, leaving only your face exposed.
As for books, it would be unwise for you to bring any
modern literature with you, as even widely-read volumes by
standard authors are liable to give offence. For safety’s sake,
restrict your travelling library to such works as Wisden’s,
Debrett, and Bradshaw’s Timetable.
One last word. If you get past the Customs, and all the
other authorities who will come to greet you, be very careful
how you look at the police who may happen to be on duty
at the wharf. Anything in the nature of an unbecoming look
in the direction of a policeman • might lead to the most
serious consequences, even deportation.
I wish you luck. This is not an easy country to get into.
Whatever you do, brush up your Italian.
The Champions.
In four years to the end of June the public debts of
the Commonwealth and the States increased from
£1,187,828,000 to £1,255,782,000 (the figures are Mr.
Casey’s). The total is almost double the British
national debt in 1914.
The British national debt then, as now, was made
up almost entirely of war expenditure. It began in
the reign of William 111. at £664,000. Marlborough’s
campaigns added £38,000,000. At the beginning of the
Seven Years’ War, the national debt stood at
£75,000,000 ; at the end, at £133,000,000. Ten millions
was paid off in the first 10 years of the third George’s
reign. When the American colonies revolted the
country owed £127,000,000 ; when they had gained
their independence it owed £243,000,000.
In 1793 the figure was £248,000,000. In the
Waterloo year it reached £861,000,000. By the time
the. Crimean business began —1854 —£86,000,000 had
been paid off. Beating Russia cost £33,000,000 ; but in
spite of wars in India, Egypt and S’Africa, 1899 saw
the indebtedness down to £599,000,000. After the
South African War it had risen to £743,000,000, but
in 11 years £67,000,000 of this was liquidated. In
March, 1914, the debt was £676,000,000.
After six years of Great War and repatriation
expenditure it had soared to £7,879,000,000. This
was progressively reduced for some years, but the
depression brought it up to a new high level-mark in
1934 —£8,030,000,000-odd. In March last it was
£7,796,000,000.
Over £3,360,000,000 of this is funded, and against
it are debts of £2,438,000,000 owing by war allies and
Dominions and colonies. So that supporting the
greatest navy in the world, maintaining an army five
times the size of Mr. Parkhill’s shadow militia, financ-
ing unemployment even now to the tune, of £38,000,000
per year, Britain’s true debt is only £5,358,000,000 or a
little more than four times Australia’s. This includes
the price of the mightiest war effort in British history.
In effect, Britain’s debt is lower than it was in
1920. The debts of the Australian States alone have
gone from £417,000,000 in that year to £864,000,000
this year. And politicians like N. S. Wales Premier
Stevens protest that they aren’t growing fast enough!

“Trides Hawl”: Prophecies about
Edward VIII. (B. 16/12/’36)? The
soundest was delivered by Keir Hardie
in the House of Commons in June, 1894,
when the House moved a congratulatory
address to Queen Victoria on the birth
of her great-grandson. Keir Hardie said
he was unable to join in this address,
adding:
We are asked to rejoice ; because this
child has been born and that he will one
day rule over this great Empire. Up to the
present we have no means of knowing what
his qualifications for that task may be.
From his childhood upwards he will be sur-
rounded by sycophants and will be taught
to believe himself a superior creature. In
due course he will tour the world—and
probably rumors of a morganatic marriage
will follow
The Prince was then but five days old.

“Butcher’s Carter”: For the first time

furnished it. On Friday only one Sydney
morning newspaper mentioned the likeli-
hood of a holiday; and there were
doubts until late in the afternoon, with
the result that there was little increase in
my usual week-end orders. Financially,
people were quite unprepared for it. I
didn’t mind because I get paid for holi-
days, but numbers of workers who don’t
must have felt the pinch at a time when
every penny is needed to meet the
demands of Santa Claus and Christmas
provisioning. England had no holiday,
and if Australia had overlooked the
occasion I’m sure George VI. would
have forgiven the lapse.

George 111. heard about his son, the

was perturbed. “What, what? You
keep an actress?” inquired H.M. “Yes,
sir,” replied William. “How much do
you ajlow her?” pressed his father. “A
thousand a year,” replied William.
“That’s too much; give her five hun-
dred,” said the King. But when the
Duke wrote to Mrs. Jordan suggesting
such a reduction, the lady is said to have
replied by sending him the bottom of a
playbill on which were underlined the
words, “No money returned after the
rising of the curtain.”

“Fillumup”: Proof that a pint of neat

traveller and a publican sank two 26-
ounce bottles of whisky between them
in remarkably quick time, drinking
glass for glass. About half-way through
the trial of endurance a kindly con-
stable, who had arrived on the scene,
warned the bagman that the threepenny-
bit he was holding between his front teeth
"Too late fer the Weddin' ladies; but the bride Wore magnolier satin and the sheilahs came in shrimp pink."
might easily be swallowed, but the advice
was disregarded. “As long as I keep it
between my teeth,” declared the com-
mercial traveller, “I can go on drinking
and won’t get drunk!” Found in bed a
couple of hours later-—dead! The post-
mortem revealed the traybit in his
stomach. But, perhaps, he was right—
his trouble had been that he failed to
keep his grip on the coin.

“Unity”: A M.L. farmer who recently

plained bitterly of the lady’s extrava-

month were one grievance ; other items
were eight pairs of shoes at one buy,
and a drapery outlay of over £2OO in
one fell swoop. A bill for £43, mostly
for silk stockings, seems to have been
the final straw which made the husband
realise that he couldn’t afford such an
expensive missus. It was a war marriage,
and, amazingly enough, the wife was a
Scotswoman.

“Tarry Rope”: The ship’s bell, bin-

Brisbane, now being broken up in
England, are to be returned as me-

ship was named. I wonder what has
become of the vessel’s band instruments?
Before the Brisbane was launched, the
position of bandmaster was advertised
and one of the applicants appointed. The
next step was to buy the instruments, and
a committee raised the money. But when
the bandmaster went on board to report
for duty there were no quarters for him.
A puzzled captain said heatedly that a
fourth-class cruiser never carried a band
and he didn’t propose to break the rule.
So the Brisbane lost its bandmaster (who
, , ... , ,
was compensated with a years salary),
but the ship had its band instruments
delivered to it in due course. They were
carried about for some time and may
have remained on board somewhere, an
unexpected find for the shipbreakers.

chipped him. “Don’t hear much news

“S.T.S.”: Edward VIII. has put up a

odd record of having attended his

tions. Queen Victoria made her own
record in a double sense, describing the
great' event in a diary. It was probably
not meant for publication ; but, when it
was “released” long afterwards, it told
how on returning from the Abbey she
put aside the Royal robes and all the
cares of State —and washed the dog.
Meanwhile, everybody now 36 has
broken a record of over four centuries
by living in five reigns, a thing last pos-
sible about the period when the elder of
the “little Princes in the Tower” vacated

down for nine years only, but his grand-
father filled it for 60 years, having been
created Prince of Wales at birth.
George IV., also securing the rank at

“ B jfl O’C”: “Likell” (B. 2/12/’36)
scout's the notion that a fire can be pro-
duced in dry grass by a cast-off
smouldering cigarette, and even throws
in such accessories as teased bark and
thistledown. Well, it can be done. It
depends on the sun temperature, the dry-
ness ,°* the combustible stuff and the
favoring wind Here are two instances.
Case , 1 > s first-hand knowledge and be-
yond dispute. The usual casual pic-
leaving the party’s pitch, placed
Qr tossed a cigarette stump on the head
G f a decaying and splintered fence-post.
Result (in flaming hot weather, of course,
with a north wind), a blazing post almost
before the offender has got out of sight.
Instance 2: The late “Rufus” Whiting-
ton, a reliable journalist and excellent
observer, reported to the Adelaide. “Ad-
vertiser” a few years ago that while he
and his friend Penfold Hyland were
motoring to Adelaide one midsummer
day, they saw a burning cigarette thrown
into the dry grass of the roadside from
another car running in front of them. It
started a fire so quickly that Whitington
and his mate were impelled to stop for
a precious half-hour and put it out.
If the burning fag is so harmless how
account for the many fires in buildings
and in ships directly traced to it? The
sequence is pretty clear: the smoulder-
ing butt discarded on carpet or bed-
clothes —the smouldering bed or floor-
cover —the ditto flooring-boards or skirt-
ing—the up-draught of air—the blazing
structure.

“C.W.0.”: John Knox’s Monstrous
Regiment of Women is not an indict-
ment of the female sex on general
grounds. Regiment means regimen, and
the book is directed against woman as
ruler, which the preacher considered con-
trary to Divine law. Elizabeth was the
Queen of England, Mary of Scotland,
and Catherine de Medici Queen Regent
of France on behalf of the young Charles
11. Elizabeth showed her displeasure by
refusing to let Knox pass through Eng-
land on his return from France to Scot-
land.
THIRTY-SIX.
Old year, your span of life is all-but ended;
Another week or two, 1 may remark,
And into shadowland you’ll have descended
And faded faintly out into the dark!
What will your portion be adown the ages?
What will they toss at you, bouquets or
bricks,
To stamp your record upon history’s pages,
Old Thirty-six?
What glowing hopes around your birth were
centred!
It ushered in, rhen thought, a brighter day.
You’d leave a better world than that you
entered,
The prophets told. But have you? Who can
say?
Though the responsibility about it
No mortal on you would attempt to fix,
I personally feel inclined to doubt it,
Old Thirty-six.
Your meanly shabby luck it was, old fellow,
To light the screen where Stalins strut and
cant,
And Adolphs and Benitos blow and bellow,
And imitation Mosleys rave and rant.
You saw a League for Peace in pieces shat-
tered,
And Mars returning to his bloody tricks,
With steel that clashed and guns that boomed
and battered,
Poor Thirty-six!
’Twas yours to hear the bugle-calls alarming
That over stricken Spain their summons sent;
You watched a war-worn world for war re-
arming
In fearful haste, and watched it impotent.
You viewed, what no one ever viewed before,
An English monarch hold his throne as nix
Compared with —call it an affaire d’amour.
Eh, Thirty-six?
Old Year, at all events we’ll not forget you!
Your bolt will soon be shot, your alley in.
And while I’m not pretending to regret you,
One can’t but wish you’d had a smoother
spin.
Years are like men. Their links with life they
sever,
Some with the ha’pence, others .with the
kicks.
Vale! Be off! Good-bye for ever and ever,
Old Thirty-six!

T. THE R.


“Harry N.”: Jack tars must have sud-
denly become fussy since I knew them
if they now resent being called Jack (B.
2/12/’36). In my four years ’tween
decks it was invariably the custom to
address as Jack any messmate of whose
moniker you were, in doubt. The name
had no reference to his calling, but was
used merely as many Australians use
“Snow” when talking to strangers. The
only time I can remember a matelot
showing resentment at being called some-
thing was when a taxi-driver in Hobart
called my Scotch cobber a “burgoo-
yafflin, bagpipe-bustin’ !” The
petrol Jehu ended up a poor second.
* * * *
“Exdig”: A war pension matter about
which there was a lot of doubt was
settled by a High Court judgment the
other day. Early in the war it was an-
nounced that any citizens rejected for
service in the A.I.F. who joined British
forces and when demobilised returned
to Australia would be given war-pension
benefits —if no pension was provided by
the British Government. A 50-year-old
citizen who tried to enlist in Sydney in
1915 was turned down, the authorities
not then being so hungry for men as
they afterwards became. He worked his
passage to England and served for four
years with the British A.M.C. ; but in-
stead of returning within six months of
his discharge he stayed in England for
“ Tickets, please. This is first-class .”
“My oath, it is!”.
two or three years more. The High
Court held that this delay was fatal
to his claim for a pension.
* * * *
“Tasma, Jun.”: At a recent christen-
ing in a Tasmanian town the congrega-
tion was provided with an unlooked-for
diversion. The surpliced clergyman had
taken the infant (a hefty young specimen
who’d been making himself vociferous
by loud cooing) from the mother’s arms
into his own, with the. usual request to
“Name this child.” A chubby hand
reached out, and fingers closed on a
prize which the infant proceeded to
dangle delightedly while the congregation
stifled its mirth. It was the parson’s
artificial teeth, which had to be care-
fully rescued and replaced before the
service could be proceeded with.
*■* * *
“Mako”: A rain of frogs? Howick,
a marine hamlet 15 miles from Auckland
(M.L.), saw the phenomenon 60 years
ago, when a party walking over the fields
had to shelter under a hedge during a
heavy shower. After the rain ceased the
grass was strewn with thousands of tiny
green frogs. Curiously, although the
shower covered a large area, the frogs
all seemed to have been dropped in the
space of two paddocks. More curious
still was the fact that the shower swept
in from the sea.
* * * *
“Sixenate”: One of those Sydney
husbands whose marital affairs are sus-
pended between the decree nisi and the
decree absolute got the shock of his life
the other day. For two years his divorce
had remained incomplete, and at last
he moved the Court. His wife countered
with an application for annulment of
the decree nisi and substitution of
judicial separation; grounds, the brute
proposed to marry again and it might
prejudice her alimony. She succeeded,
and the chain holds. But judicial sep-
arations, once useful enough, no doubt,
seem rather an archaic survival.
* * * *
“E.J.M.”: This is the “Year of Three
Kings,” according to some ecclesiastic
commentator in England. Yet it hap-
pened once before —in 1066. On January
5 of that year, Edward the Confessor
died. On the same day Harold was
chosen King by the Witan. On October
14 the Battle of Hastings ended his reign
and his life, and William the Conqueror
arrived. William was crowned on
Christmas Day in Westminster Abbey.
* * * *
“Historical Bloque”: There is one
prison in Groperland which not only
had barred windows (B. 9/12/’36) but
has bars over the chimney. Convict-
built, despite the supervision of warders
the chimney was somehow made large
enough for two men to help one another
up and so to freedom. Still standing at
the back of the present Fremantle traffic
bridge across the Swan, in early days it
housed the men who kept the bridge in
repair. They were locked in each night,
but when things quietened down one of
them would be helped up the chimney,
returning with as much grog as he could
get from the shanty-keeper near the
bridge. One night he returned with all
the grog inside himself and the resultant
row brought an investigation, and there-
after the bars cut off the track to the
grog house.
“Nordbo”: In the gambling schools
of Cairns (N.Q.) one can often see a
player tuck a dried sea-horse under the
armband of his shirt-sleeve before he
commences a game. It is the latest and
most potent charm to attract good luck,
the magic properties of rabbit-feet and
horseshoes being considered insignificant
in comparison. The market value of the
new mascot is ten shillings—reasonable
enough if it will do a fraction of what is
claimed for it.
“Avian”: If “O’G.” (B. 9/12/’36)
thinks that women pilots are more skil-
ful than men he has mistaken amazing
luck for proficiency. When Amy John-
son arrived at Darwin after the hop
across the Timor, C. W. A, Scott, who
flew from Brisbane to meet her, found
that the engine of her ’plane lacked com-
pression on two of its four cylinders and
that the propeller nuts needed taking up
“anything from half to a complete turn.”
When the engine had cooled down, it
took “two strong men and much per-
spiration” to remove the spark-plugs;
“the vent plug in the sump was only un-
screwed by colossal strength and a huge
“Put me on to Santa Claus, please! Room twenty-one, I think.”
spanner and tommy bar.”- Admittedly
none of the fair fliers has been killed
in crashes, but plenty of them have
crashed. Jean Batten has had four
smashes ; Mrs. Markham’s Atlantic stunt
finished with her ’plane wrecked in a
swamp; Mrs. Miller, on the only big
flight she has made alone, that to South
Africa, smashed her ’plane beyond re-
pair, and Freda Thompson, as “O’G.”
admits, has had a crash or two. Any-
how, the only women who have made
flights at all comparable with those of
Kingsford Smith and Hinkler are Mrs.
Putnam (her San Francisco-Honolulu
effort) and Jean Batten (her most recent
venture). You can’t tell me that women
pilots are as good as men. I have seen
too many strained undercarriages and
bent axles.
* * * *
“S. Gumm”: The girl-friend’s reading
is confined to flapper-papers and
“motion”-picture magazines. Thinking
to improve what—being always the
gentleman—l call her mind I tried her
with this:—•
Yes, we arraign her! but she
The weary Titan! with deaf
Ears and labor-dimmed eyes,
Regarding neither to right
Nor left, goes passively by,
Staggering on to her goal,
Bearing on shoulders immense,
Atlantean, the load,
Well nigh not to be borne,
Of the too-vast. orb of her fate.
“That’s just about right,” said the G.F.,
“except for one word. It’s reely not fair
to call her a tight ’un. How d’ you know
she ever got tight?” “Who the”—l
began—“what on earth do you mean?”
“Mrs. Simpson,” said the G.F.
* * * *
“Ike Hollar”: Another classic story
about bad handwriting (B. 9/12 / ’36)
attaches itself to Tighe Ryan, who, when
he edited the Sydney “Catholic Press,”
had the reputation of being the worst
caligraphist ever known in the Austra-
lian Inky Way. A special compositor
(Tighe belonged to the hand-setting days),
who was supposed to know his editor’s
phrasing by heart, was kept to set his
stuff, but a rumpus occurred on one oc-
casion over a sub-leader which roused
many objections, and which Tighe Ryan
didn’t remember writing. The composi-
tor dug out the manuscript to clear him-
self. “Why, you fool,” roared Ryan,
“that isn’t a sub-leader; it’s my laundry
list!” '
* & * *
“Oxmead”: I wonder if there was
much discussion about our ex-King’s new
title or the place he should take it from.
Although it has become in some sort
the family name, as more palatable than
Guelph or Wettin, since George V.
signed a proclamation in 1917 “adopt-
ing for the Royal Family the style of
the House and Family of Windsor,”
there were and are two previous Wind-
sors scheduled in the peerage. The
ancient borough provides one of the
secondary titles for the Marquess of
Bute, whose ancestor obtained it, along
with his marquessate, in 1796. And the
present Earl of Plymouth figures in the
reference books as the fifteenth Baron
Windsor and the second Viscount of that
name ; his son wears the latter title as
a courtesy one.
* * * *
“Main Brace”: “Roier” (B. 9/12/’36),
deriding my statement that a ’plane would
overtake a charge of buckshot fired from
it, confuses vacuum with pressure. The
air resistance at 400 m.p.h. down a gun
barrel of (say) one inch in diameter
would be nearly equivalent to putting
the gun barrel under water. “Roier”
further stigmatises as preposterous my
assertion about a one-inch hole being
sufficient to strip a ’plane, but I would
remind him that I was talking of ’planes
whose slipstream is so great that a
pilot putting his head out of the shelter
of the cowling would have his neck
broken instantly. These differ materially
from the flying kites used in the last war,
wherein pilots without cowling and wind-
screen often flew without goggles. I
know because I have done it.
* * * *
“Ahem!”: There’s many a true word
spoken in jest. Thus the picture of
“George” wearing his wife’s intimate
garments (B. 4/11/’36) recalls that mill-
hands on the Wiluna mine (W.A.) don
rayon bloomers, fastened top and
bottoms with elastic, the reason being
that these afford the only known pro-
tection, accompanied by ventilation,
against the insidious arsenical dust.
* * * *
“Intacta”: If “Ardsollus” (B. 2/12/ ’36)
has not yet heard an Irishman pronounce
“i” as “oi” he can never have met a
man from Tipperary. The “stone-
throwers” always so pronounce it. When
we were kids at school we had typical
sentences for the various species of pro-
vincialism. One was: “Oi want moi
boots minded. I want thim noice an’
toidy an’ hoigh behoind, an’ Oi’ll call
for thim on Froiday noight at noine.”
* * * *
“Binduli”: Reference to Findley,
printer of a Melbourne Labor paper,
having been ejected from the Vic. Par-
liament for publishing a “Foul Libel on
the King” in 1901 (B. 16/12/’36) re-
minds me that he was not the only
offender. The article, largely a farrago
of abuse, was not original; it was re-
printed from an English newspaper.
Tommy Walker, afterwards a Labor
Attorney-General and Speaker of the
W.A. Assembly, fell on the stuff as
“good copy” and sped it on its way in
two Westralian weeklies of the period.
But Perth was a long way from Mel-
bourne in those days, and the editors
had no Parliamentary positions Qf which
they might have been deprived. There
was one exception. Hugh Mahon,
M.H.R., had been editor of one of these
publications and Prime Minister Barton
asked for an assurance from him that he
had no longer anything to do with its
control or with what appeared in its
columns. Mahon gave it. But Mahon
was destined to meet, 20 years later, the
same fate as Findley—only, in his case,
it was the spoken not the written word
that landed him in trouble.
KISSING-TIME.
A time and place there is for everything!
Plumbers and purple ties and periwinkles
And inky bards dissecting the dead spring
And statesmen working Coronation wrinkles!
Dreams die, youth fades, and pubs, alas! must
close —
Ev’n 1 at times grow, scant of rhyme and
reason,
Yet there is one thing every poet knows,
That kissing-time is never out of season!
Corinna, currently my heart’s delight
(Since I have fallen out of love with Sadie),
Slim Lindsay lassie, etched in black and white,
In fitting fashion for a lover’s lady;
Live illustration to a fairy tale!
Love laughs, like rhyme, but after rhyme
comes reason!
Let’s kiss! Dusk darkens round us, veil on
veil,
And kissing-time is never out of season!
Lady, I know in days of real sport.
Too often I’ve been served with Love’s
subpoena,
Commanding my attendance at his court.
In re the matter of a lien on Lena
Or Dorothy (the red-haired one) or Grace —
Ah! yet the Lord High Justice of Unreason,
Dan Cupid’s self, gave judgment in each case
That kissing-time is never out of season!
Not lightly, as of old, comes loveliness! '
Sung is the Golden Bird’s first careless lyric;
Moth-white Titania, in her moon-white dress,
Turns Puck, with mocking eye and lip satiric.
But what of that? Love’s one brief madcap
rhyme
May leaven all the unleavened years of reason.
And now have done with words, ’tis kissing-
time !
And kissing-time is never out of season.
QUEENSLAND.

CIGARETTE OF THIS GENERAT
THE

TIPPED
POLITICAL POINTS
The barling Downs division, in which
a by-election was raging when this
Bulletin edition had to go to the
printer, is all mixed up with wheat and
butter and that sort of thing. Never-
theless, its title is now much of a mis-
nomer, for the electorate slops over the
coastwise side of the Range and runs
down into much of the Brisbane River
valley. On the Downs proper the old
antipathies between Toowoomba and
Warwick have not been wholly exor-
cised. Strangely enough, it was a War-
wick man who defeated the late Littleton
Groom the only time the electorate
turned him down.
It has come out that Sydney’s County
Council, which sells electric lighting and
power for “as much as the traffic will
bear,” anticipates a “net loss” of £20,800
in 1936. The “net' loss” would be
£49,000-odd if Lloyd, the two-jobs chair-
man with the precarious Assembly seat,
had got awa’y with his precious 40-hour-
week scheme.
Coronation invitations to State Pre-
miers have been issued, not by the Brit-
ish Government but by the Empire Par-
liamentary Association. Australian tax-
payers are bled for seven annual sub-
scriptions to this show. The total,
amount is not great, but the fact is
grimly significant. In hundreds, thou-
sands, of ways Australians have to pay
through the nose because they are bur-
dened with seven Parliaments when
South Africa, Maoriland and Britain
each get along with one.
Now that the mischief has been done,
C. of E. bishops are reproaching the late
King at a great rate. The Archbishop of
Canterbury finds that' he “sought happi-
ness in a manner inconsistent with Chris-
tian principles,” and that his “circle of
friends has been rebuked by the judg-
ment of the nation.” “I have shrunk from
saying these things,” the eminent divine
concluded. Yes, he shrank from saying
anything until it was too late to do any
good.
The Kennedy Federal seat is to remain
in the Riordan family, at least for a time ;
the succession has passed from the late
Darby Riordan to his nephew, W.J.F.
But W.J.F. failed to get an absolute
majority over his three opponents, an
Ind. Lab., a Communist and a Douglas
Credit man; and before the general
election he will have to contest a pre-
selection ballot. The Q.C.E. nominated
him. Many Queenslanders with Labor
sympathies prefer to do their own pick-
ing.
J. T. Boyd, who polled well against
W. J. F. Riordan in Kennedy, is chair-
man of the Cloncurry Shire Council.
Though called Ind. Lab. he got nearly
all the U.A.P.-U.C.P. votes ; the Minis-
terial organisations squibbed it. Yet
Grosvenor Francis won Kennedy as a
Nationalist at two elections.
It is amusing to recall that at the Loan
Council meeting last month some of the
borrowing Premiers demanded “an imme- (
diate loan of £10,000,000.” When the"
Commonwealth Bank Board said
£7,500,000 was the limit', Dunstan and
Ogilvie went off pop. Butler, while not
carping at the amount, protested that the
rate of interest was too high. The event
proved him wrong, though not so wrong
as the other two.
Ogilvie letting himself go because the
Commonwealth Bank Board refused to
underwrite a £10,000,000 loan:
It is a plain attempt to dictate to the
various Governments the policy of Aus-
tralia.
The public subscribed £5,509,000.
The wife of a U.S. ambassador newly-
appointed to Russia is taking with her
2000 pints of cream, and is having 25
refrigerators installed in her Moscow
home to keep it. It is a queer com-
mentary on the efforts of writing men
all the world over to present Moscow
as a paradise of Communist comfort. It
is, of course,. alleged that the lady is
shockingly ill-informed, but that won’t
wash.
N.S.W. Auditor-General Spence re-
ports that “the capital indebtedness of
the metropolitan tramways has been
written down £150,000 without statu-
tory authority.” Still this is only of a
piece with the transport “policy” of the
Stevens Government, which is to let the
Commissioner— any Commissioner —do
“ Don't be mean with the complimentaries, John. We're having a lot of
trouble at home!"
what he likes. If he chooses to go
abroad, order a grand new building for
his staff, expropriate private services, or
decide whether or not this suburb shall
have Government motor-buses and that
suburb Government trolley-buses, it is
done. The Commissioner is boss; the
Government is just his obedient servant.
■ Victorian Senator Leckie, whose son-
in-law is Attorney General:
The restrictions imposed upon imports
from Japan and U.S.A. will be of no
benefit to our secondary industries. As a
matter of fact, the [Whiskard-Gullett]
tariff is not worth twopence to Australian
manufacturers at the present time.
It’s a true bill, but no Ministerial sup-
porter had previously admitted it.
H. M. Russell, the Queensland M.L.A.,
who leads a sort of U.A.P. party which
consists mainly of himself, mildly
applauded Labor’s Income-tax Assess-
ment Bill “because it goes a long way
towards uniformity,” but said he would
prefer it to go the whole hog—one
income-tax for Australia. That would
mean unification,” said Forgan Srnitrn
Russell, with the characteristic U.A.P.
fondness for half measures, replied that
he was no unificationist. Hundreds of
thousands of Australians differ from him.
Howie, M.L.C., is to be Lord Mayor
of Sydney for another term, with an
allowance of £2250. He deserves an-
other term, but not an increase of £750,
which increase is iniquitous when rates
are so high and there is an accumulated
deficit of half a million or so. Even in
the Harbor Bridge year the allowance
was £l5OO.
“The orderly-marketing legislation was
supported by every party,” said Menzies,
pleading for his referendum. True
enough, and it is also connected with
a fond belief that there is an ever-expand-
ing market in Britain for “primary
produce.” Stevens came back from
abroad with this flattering tale. Belshaw,
Professor of Economics in the M.L. Uni-
versity, has returned from Western
Europe convinced that there is nothing
in it; that the fostering of agriculture
in countries with declining populations
is making it a fantastic dream, and that
Australia and Maoriland will have to go
in more for “development of non-primary
industries.”
Manufacturers in other States must
find the position of F. P. Kneeshaw
rather amazing. He is a U.A.P. poli-
tician, an M.L.C. re-elected for 12 years,
and at the same time director of a cement
company and a big gun in the Chamber
of Manufactures. As such he pas-
sionately defended Canberra’s trade-
diversion “policy,” though at the very
time Canberra was depriving cement
cos. of the protective duty they have had
ever since the war. Perhaps Mr. Knee-
shaw is the sort of manufacturer who
doesn’t want protection any more.
When the outspoken Cerutty ceased
to be Auditor-General, Ministers at Can-
berra sighed with relief, anticipating
among other things a long respite from
annoying remarks about the size of the
pensions bill and the apparent ease with
which pensions could be wangled. But
in the very first report of Cerutty’s suc-
cessor there was a pointed reference to
the number of invalid pensions in N. S.
Wales being out of all proportion to the
number in other States, and now the
Government has got to make some sort
of inquiry.
An amateur statistician has been try-
ing to calculate how much Senators have
received for their Parliamentary exer-
tions since the last general election. He
works it out that they averaged £l9 a
sitting. Massy Greene fared best, having
been present on twelve (12) occasions;
average, £l5O a sitting. Two pay-cuts
have been “restored” during the period
under notice, and the amateur statistician
may be a bit out in his reckoning, but it
is near enough. Massy Greene is a Sena-
tor from N. S. Wales who lives in Mel-
bourne.
In the Macquarie-street Assembly the
other day Stevens introduced what he
called “a permanent plan for housing
improvement and clearance of slum
areas.” On the same day his Govern-
ment published particulars of Crown land
sales at Maroubra Junction and Bondi.
Since April 27, 1935, it has sold 194
building blocks in those neighborhoods,
prices ranging from £3 17s. to £8 3s. a
foot. A Government which sells
suburban land served by its own tram-
ways when it is going in for “slum clear-
ance and housing improvement” should
really get its head read.
A great deal has been said about the
emigration of young Tasmanians to the
mainland. Little has been heard about
the exodus of South Australians ; but,
according to Auditor-General Wain-
wright, giving evidence at a living-wage
inquiry in Adelaide, approximately
19,000 people have left S.A. in the last
eight years.
Most of them were younger, more pro-
gressive and more capable than those who
did not leave. The population contains a
greater proportion of older people than
formerly.
The A.-G. sees no prospect of the State
budget being balanced “for many years
to come.” However, the Adelaide Gov-
ernment is to have a grand Parliament
House to go broke in.
Melbourne has received only one hint
it can apply to the business that brought
Chief Inspector Duncan to Victoria. The
Scotland Yard man told the Old Para-
dians that policemen “must not be arro-
gant, but must be counsellors and ad-
visers to the public, as well as enemies
of lawbreakers.” If his report, expected
this week, shakes some of the blustering
arrogance out of a section of the force,
he’ll have done Melbourne —and police-
men who are not arrogant—a good turn.
Prof. Copland, who has been abroad
telling the Americans all about Aus-
tralia’s economic recovery, is back with
the news that “Fascism in Germany and
Italy, rather than Communism, is the
real menace to world peace.”
In both countries national feelings are
so stirred up that they have become a real
menace.
But wasn’t it Communism’s “world revo-
lution” that' stirred them up, and isn’t
the alleged “menace” as doubtful as the
alleged abandonment of “world revolu-
tion”? Of the Red devil as well as the
old Prince of Darkness it may be true
that “When the devil was sick the devil a
saint would be ; when the devil was well
the devil a saint was he.”
From Canberra, December, 1945:
The Minister for Trade Treaties states that
negotiations for a settlement of the trade war
with Japan are progressing. There are grounds
for hoping that an arrangement on an amicable
basis will be reached in due time. Meanwhile
the Minister declines to say anything on the
subject, and wishes other people also to keep
quiet. The Minister and the Consul-General,
he indicates, are on excellent terms and will
reach an understanding if left to themselves or
to one another.

LARGEST NON-LICENSED HOTEL IN AUSTRALIA
PERSONAL ITEMS
Gatton Agricultural College (Q.) will
miss some familiar faces through retire-
ments. Colonel A. J. Mackenzie is tak-
ing a well-earned rest after 18 years as
lecturer, and M. J. Jordan, who ploughed
the first furrow on the farm and who
had been foreman for 40 years, also goes
out.
Australian cities have set a new
physical standard for Lord Mayors in
recent elections. Both Alf Jones, of
Brisbane, whose picture by Dubois
appears herewith, and Howie, of Sydney,
Lord Mayor ALF JONES.
are hefty persons who could quite com-
petently do their own throwing-out.
Howie, a builder by profession and
farmer by choice, is as thick as Jones,
but Jones, a miner who dug up a gold
pass a quarter-century ago and who was
for some time leading light of Labor in
the Queensland Legislative Council as
well as Mines Minister, compares with
him in solid bulk, and is about the
height of an average skyscraper. Until
Camera becomes Mayor of Rome the
world will probably never see a bigger
Right Worshipful wearing rabbit-skins.
Dead in Brisbane Captain Alexander
Brown, who had been 65 years in the
Queensland shipping trade ; he entered
via the old A.S.N. Co. For a time
he was Kanaka-recruiting—in the days
of black labor in the North —but his last
half-century of service was as a wharf-
superintendent for various companies
along the Queensland coast. After 1899
he was on duty in Brisbane, retiring in
1931, and was as well-known to habitues
of the port as the Pile Light.
The return of Lord Wigram to Buck-
ingham Palace as Permanent Lord in
Waiting restores one of King George’s
oldest friends to eminence. He began
life in the army and saw a lot of Indian
n.-w. frontier service up to the days of
Curzon, whose A.D.C. he became. He.
was brought to George V.’s notice when
serving as the King’s chief of staff
during the Indian tour of 1905-06, and on
George V.’s accession he was made an
equerry, assistant private secretary and
K.C.B. In 1931 he succeeded Lord
Stamfordham as private secretary. His
successor, Alexander Hardinge, is at 42
one of the youngest men who has ever
held the job. He also has deep-rooted
Indian associations and Dominion ones
as well, for his father, Baron Hardinge
of Penshurst, was Indian Viceroy, and
his uncle Governor-General of Canada.
A grand-uncle served in India, Cairo
and Zanzibar. Young Hardinge is an
accomplished linguist.
H. T. Cavell becomes the only mem-
ber of the Queensland Ambulance
Transport Brigade to hold both the
Q.A.T.B. and the. St. John’s long-service
medals. Joining St. John’s in London in
1896, he was on duty at Queen Vic-
toria’s jubilee celebrations, at her funeral
and at the Coronation and funeral of
Edward VII. He came to Australia in
1911 and enlisted in the Q.A.T.B. dur-
ing the war.
The Brisbane-Adelaide air race was won
by a Queenslander, J. W. Collins, in a
machine designed by Edgar Percival, an-
other Australian. Collins, from scratch,
flew the distance in actual time of 9hr.
24min. 12sec. His wife, daughter of
Sydney’s ex-Lord Mayor Hagon, was pas-
senger. Collins’s people are deep-rooted
in Queensland. With an eye for country
in the early days they picked one of the
best pastoral holdings in the coast district
just over the N. S. Wales border, and
became lords of the manor in a part
where every station-owner observed the
state of an old-fashioned squire. In a
later day their home at Nindooimbah
was an inevitable place of call for visit-
ing royalty; among others, Edward
VIII. went there when Prince of Wales.
Out of the air, Collins is a champion
skier. In second place in the flight was
P. H. Moody, a well-known professional
pilot. The women’s trophy went to
Nancy Bird (N.S.W.). A prize for gal-
lantry should have been awarded to
B. W. Monk. His sky steed was a DH9,
20 years old.
Will Ashton,
though he received
his early school-
ing in Adelaide
and regards him-
self as an Austra-
lian, was born in
Yorkshire. He got
his real start by
winning the
Wynne prize in
Sydney in 1908. He
studied in England
and France and
exhibited at many
leading shows, in-
cluding those of
the. Royal Aca-
demy and the
Paris Salon, and he
was for some time
on the Common-
wealth’s Art Ad-
visory Board.
Federal Govern-
ment commis-
sioned him to

at Botany Bay;

France. The artist is represented by
work in all Australian galleries.
From over the Tweed:
The Strathmore family of the new Queen of
England has no royal blood in it, but it has
distinctions which English royalty has not. It
has Glamis, a castle near Brechin, which is
about the oldest residence in Scotland —com-
plete with family ghost and a secret sup-
posed to be communicated to every eldest son
on coming of age. No outsider has ever learnt
it, but it is supposed to sadden the recipient
for the rest of his existence. It apparently
doesn’t prevent him from living long. The
present earl, a tall, wiry old man with mid-
Victorian moustachios, is 81 and still going
strong; his brother is 80. Their father was
born in 1824, and lived to be four-score.
The daughter is the first Queen of England who
can claim that her grandfather was a plain
Smith —he had a small estate at Blendon Hall,
Kent. The new Queen’s mother was the
daughter of an untitled parson, a Cavendish
Bentinck who was g.-g.-grandson of the third
Duke of Portland. The Strathmore family have
also in their lineage one ancestress who was
burnt as a witch on Castle Hill, Edinburgh.
She was supposed to have turned her wiles
against James V. of Scotland, the poet-father of
Mary Queen of Scots. It was intended to wipe
out her son when he reached his majority, but
the accuser of the family confessed that his story
was untrue, so the young man was saved to pass
on his blood to royal heirs. The present
heir to the Strathmore earldom served through the
war with the Black Watch. He also has per-
formed another feat which has never been re-
corded in the British royal family. His wife, a
daughter of a Duke of Leeds, celebrated the
armistice year by presenting him with twins.
R. P. Franklin, who has taken his last
class at Melbourne Grammar, took a
first in classics at Cambridge, came to
Australia in 1911, and went from an
assistant mastership at Sydney Church
of England Grammar School to the job
he is just leaving He was a great athlete
in his day, and got his full blue at the
university. During the war he served
as a lieutenant in the A.I.F. He was
the only unmarried head of a Great
Public School in Australia.
Flinders-lane, Melbourne, loses one of
its most colorful personalities with the
retirement of Frederick (“Paddy”)
Sheahan, of P. Sheahan and Co. His
firm specialises as selling agents for the
beekeeper, and during the past 40 years
handled a million and a half 601 b. tins
of honey, with a few thousand tons of
beeswax as a sideline. Sheahan is
acknowledged to be one of the best
judges of bee products in the Common-
wealth. A large proportion of South
Aus. apiarists consigned their honey to
him.
“Petrie”: Young Bill Riordan, who
takes the place of his late uncle, Darby
Riordan, as Federal member for Ken-
nedy, will be one of the tallest men in
the House. All the Riordans are big
men, but Bill can look over the heads
of most of them. He has been secretary
to his father, W. J. (“Jim”) Riordan, of
the State Industrial Court, for the last
three years, and is studying for the Bar.
Another youthful member of the Riordan
clan, Ernie (Bill’s cousin), is State mem-
ber for Bowen.

tin artist Ted Scor-
field, is another of

the office the other
day, and an-
nounced himself as
Michael Terry.
Arriving in Aus-
tralia in his early
twenties after ser-
vice in Russia,
Terry started to see
the continent. His
first trip took him
across northern
Australia to
Broome via the
Murrinji, and he
has since spent
most of his time
exploring the
country round the
edges of the Vic-
toria desert and
collecting data for
scientific societies.
He has written a
number of books
which have done
much to advertise interior Australia.
The Royal Geographical Society awarded
him the Cuthbert-Peek Grant in 1925.
He is in Sydney to write a novel.
Dr Kenneth McDonald, dead at 46,
was both padre and doctor. Born in the
Maitland (N.S.W.) district he became a
minister of the kirk, and in 1918 took up
mission work at Port Hedland with the
A.1.M., studying medicine in his spare
time. In 1929 he was appointed lec-
turer in anatomy at Sydney University,
where he took his degrees, and later was
first resident medical officer at the Ash-
field Masonic Hospital. Since 1933 he
had been in private practice at Lane
Cove, where he also ministered at the
local kirk.
Melbourne “Argus,” after a hunt last-
ing several months, has chosen G. C.
Codlin, assistant g.m. of the “S. M.
Herald,” as business head. Not the least
qualification of Codlin is that he looks
like the g.m. of an “Argus.” A Maori-
lander and a qualified accountant, he
was for 21 years manager of the success-

ful Auckland “Herald” and “Weekly
News.” Ten years ago, he negotiated an
agreement between M.L. newspaper pro-
prietors and London advertising agents.
At 53 he is a solid, pleasant personality
who has given up the rifle-shooting
that was the hobby of his youth for
golf and fishing.
From Ted Grayndler, M.L.C.:
There was a reference to me in B. 18/11 /’36;
I was out of the State at the time and missed
that issue. I know The Bulletin is always
careful of its facts, so please allow me to
correct it. I was born at One Tree Hill, Mt.
Victoria —say about 60 miles as the crow
flies from The Bulletin office. It was my
father, John Baptist Grayndler, who was born
in Canada —at Three Rivers, Montreal.
Tas. Assembly is losing its father, old
John Evans, sometime master-mariner
and Warden of the Cinque Ports—no,
of the port of Hobart. John went into
Tasmanian politics in 1897, being then
41, and has been in them ever since.
He was Premier for five years, 1904-09,
Chief Secretary, Treasurer and Minister
of Education besides —Tas. Cabineteers
are expected to work for their salaries—
and Speaker on several occasions. His
acquaintance with the Parliament began
before the Ogilvie brothers, the Premier
and the Attorney-General, were old

Harry Lauder, kilts and all, is back in
Australia, but his great singing days are
over, though he still raises his voice
sometimes. Harry sports one of the
most original entries in the English

that he “began life as a mill-boy, then a
miner ; now is what people have made
him.” Also, this confession:

ABORIGINALITIES
“Western”: Heading for Yerilla in the
early ’nineties, with a wagon carrying
two 400-gallon tanks, one filled with
bottled “neck oil,” Pinjarrah Jack shed
a back wheel about 40 miles out. With
nothing for it but to return to Cool-
gardie, he decided to cache his load. He
dug deep, finally shaping the surface to
a seemly mound, on which he planted a
rough cross carrying the inscription: “To
the memory of Jack Jones, Died of
Thirst.” Back to the main camp on a
salmon-gum skid, Pinjarrah found that
he needed to go right down to The Cross
for a wheel. Thus weeks grew into
months, and, with traffic increasing on
the track all the time, many a swamper
reverently raised his hat to the dead—
“ Poor bloke, what happened to him might
easily happen to us.” There was even
some indignation when one day an “in-
human ghoul” with a wagon was detected
disturbing the remains. But the neck oil
was nice and cool after being buried so
deep, and Pinjarrah did quite a trade
right on the spot. Up and down the
track the owners of hundreds of parched
throats grinned sourly when they heard
of how they had unwittingly passed such
an unguarded depot of the “best.”
* * * *
_ “Benachie.”: Investigating a great flap-
ping of wings in the far corner of the
paddock, where some scrub had been
burned off the week before, we found a
kookaburra, the lower part of whose,
beak had pierced right through a thin
charred sapling. Heavier logs prevented
the stick from being lifted off the ground,
and Jacky, who had apparently mis-
taken it for a snake, was so firmly held
that he might have paid for his excel-
lent marksmanship with his life.
* * * *
“Vox”: One of the myths which
refuse to perish is ventriloquism—people
still believe that voices ca*h be tossed
about like a ball. Absurd tales are. told
of birds and animals, among them that
a bellbird can lead a man to look for
his horses half a mile from where the
bird is performing. Apart from the fact
that the call isn’t bell-like, the, “ventrilo-
quism” is merely due to a muffled sound.
The bird that gets nearest to ventrilo-
quism is auld Bubbly Jock, the bronze-
wing turkey gobbler. Watch that
strutter when he’s cutting a dash before
his ladies: after the gobble there’s a
deep boom, and if there was a dummy
in sight, opening and shutting its mouth,
you’d bet that the dummy was doing it.
* * * *
“Nordbo”: One of the reasons why
Sven, the little .Swede with the sky-blue
baby eyes, member of a scrub-clearing
gang near Cairns (N.Q.), had come to
Australia was because he was told that
here were no ferocious beasts of prey
to endanger his life. Judge then his
consternation when from behind a
stump he was grubbing sprang an enor-
mous spider. Its hairy body was the
size of a half-crown piece, its head re-
sembled a baboon’s with the addition of
saucer-like, protruding eyes, and it had
long, hairy legs. Instead of trying to
escape it ran rapidly towards Sven,
stopped a yard away and sat back on
its haunches with head erect as if ready
to spring. Sven lifted his axe. On
second thoughts he stepped back and
rapidly tucked his trouser-legs into his
socks. Thus protected he attacked vali-
antly. When the dust of battle had
cleared he looked in vain for the dead
body of his antagonist. He rubbed his
chin, the sky-blue eyes blinking his con-
sternation. “Ai tink Ai go home,” said
Sven.
* * * *
“Long Legs”: Emus get a lot of
notoriety in drought times for damage
done in the Westralian wheatbelt, but in
W.Q. they must be of a less hardy breed,
being always the first to go under when
a bit of a dry pinch comes. Mentally
the sheep is a genius compared with an
emu. I’ve seen those birds dying of
thirst when fenced off from the water
ahead of them, with gallons of gargle
behind them not half a mile distant,
and with pads leading to it! The ’roos
"When I say ‘ heave-o ,' George , just arch
your back!”
will still be bounding over the plains,
shining with good condition, when the
emus start to buckle at the, knees, and
stagger in their strides. If those pre-
datory West. Aus. birds are as tough as
alleged then some of them should be
sent to W.Q. for stud purposes to infuse
brains and stamina into the run-out stuff
we breed here.
* * *, *
“Tarboy”: The new poisoner could
chef all right, and things went well until
Hennessy found fault with the bread.
Pausing in the carving of a block of
corned, the cook received the deputa-
tion, at the same time economising
minutes by taking up his murderous-
looking carver and steel and proceeding
to put a razor edge on the blade. “Well,
what is it? (Slick! slick!) Bread! Well
(slick! slick!), if some of you blankards
would remember there’s an axe (slick!
slick!) the cook might get enough wood
to keep the, oven up (slick! slick!). As
it is” The glittering blade and the
glint in its wielder’s eye just about had
Hennessy hypnotised. Letting himself go,
the bab. enlarged on the theme, setting
out his points by bringing the whirling
blade down viciously on the table. After
that he won every argument —the work-
manlike way in which he began steeling
up that razor edge convincing the most
obdurate. “Looks like a blanky mur-
derer to me,” Hennessy confided. “Can’t
stand any blankard that’s too handy with
the knife!” Disheartened with defeat,
Hennessy finally pulled his cheque and
departed. Came the end of the season
and, with the butcher and most of the
gang gone, the boss suggested that the
bab. should try his handy blade on a
jumbuck. “Me kill a poor blanky
sheep,” said the bab., aghast. Cripes,
I can’t even stiffen the poultry for the
old woman when I’m home! ”
* * * *
“Duggai”: The district from which the
a bo. toasting a lizard at the head of this
page reckons the best rum comes dates
back to 1828, when it was explored by
Captain Logan, accompanied by Allan
Cunningham. It was one of the early
sugargrowing districts and one of the
first to make rum. The name was given
first to a sugar farm on the Albert
River by John Davey, “in memory of
my native village in England.” Floods
in the Albert River and later the needs of
the railway caused the. site of the early
township to be changed four times, but
each time it retained its name of Been-
leigh. Many German colonists settled
in the district, to-day one of the richest
and most prosperous in south Queens-
land.
* * * *
“Pack-bag”: Tiger snakes? At Trago-
wel Estate, South Kerang (Vic.), a con-
tractor began cutting a stack of dry box-
wood with a saw bench, and 11 of these
wrigglers had been sliced in pieces when
the first cord was hacked up. His men
then struck.
* * * *
“Ex-’rooer”: Manufactured dingo
scalps (B. 4/11/’36) reminded me of the
time when I and three other shooters,
after being out for three, months, took
in 6000 ’roo scalps, which at that time
were worth 4d. each. We thought we
hadn’t done too badly until the receiv-
ing officer told us that on the previous
day two shooters had delivered more
than our total, after only three weeks’
collecting. We suggested that they must
have been putting °ne ovsr him, a n<l be

“Koax”: The frog in the rock has
turned up again, this time in a reef at
the 870 ft. level of a Bendigo (Vic.) mine,
Froggy was transparent white and died
as soon as he was taken into outer day-
light. The cavity in which he was found
was full of water fed from crevices in.
the quartz, so it is evident he arrived in
his quarters as spawn and lived on what
the seeping water brought him in the
way of tucker. He was far from a
record-holder, even for Victoria. Years
ago a frog was found imprisoned in the
same way at 3000 ft. in Lansell’s 180
mine. ‘
**, * *
“Groper”: In addition to the croak-
ing frogs common to every swamp, S.-W.
Groperland possesses two curios—the
screamer and the moaner. Returning
to the shack near midnight I have been
startled by a shrill scream of fear as
the door flew open. Only a frog that
had somehow got inside, but for the
moment as vocal as a frightened child!
One day the big Muscovy captured an
outsize, and the pathetic squeals as the
hopper resisted engorgement so moved
the Choom that he rushed to the rescue,
cheating the drake out of what he prob-
ably regarded as a hard-earned meal.
But no one would rescue a moaner! Its
moan, straight from the sepulchre,
answered by a cobber or cobbers any-
where within hearing, and so the melan-
choly exchange going on, brings normal
persons to insomnia and insomniacs to
the asylum. Rewards have been offered
by tired businessmen for the extirpation
of one of these gentry. Tradition has it
that early Frenchmen, who, exploring
the Swan, camped one night near a
colony of moaners, fled in terror from
the evil spirits at the first peep of day.
* * * *
“Barangkali”: A Bulletin contri-
butor stated that Torres Strait skin divers
avoid greasy or oily expanses on the
water’s surface because of its attraction
for sharks. In cabled reports of pilots
who participated in the rescue work
when the Hollander Van der Wijck
foundered off the coast of Java it was
mentioned that the released oil cargo
covered a big area, and “acted as a de-
terrent to the sharks.” Hundreds of
the brutes, it was said, swam in circles
around the oily patch, but none ven-
tured inside it. Are the Java Sea sharks
different from those of Torres Strait, or
who has been romancing?
“Tam”: Add to “Murgiemurgie’s” list
of buffalo-shooters (B. 2/12/’36) the late
Paddy Cahill, one time of Delamere
Downs and afterwards at Ooenpelli as
Protector of Aboriginals. Paddy’s record
equalled Ben Martin’s 48 buffaloes
dropped in a single gallop, but was per-
formed in about 10 minutes under Ben’s
time. It was done in the Mary River
country; I was camped close to Paddy’s
outfit.

“L’Oiseau Brun”: The locals have de-
dared all along that the rain will not
come until about March, notwithstand-
ing the fearsome-looking storms that
bank up at the back of the mountain
and the six or eight hailstones that fall
with a businesslike clatter, only to fizzle
out in the usual feeble way. Reason is
that the birds have built in the spouting
round the house, so the rain won t come
until the fledglings can leave the nests.
PUMPING.
You couldn’t call it a river to-day,
You could hardly call it a creek;
It trickles along in a tired way,
Narrow and shallow and wegk.
We scan the sky for a sign of hope,
But we see no hopeful sign;
So out with the engine—on with the belt —
Down by the Condamine.
The leathers are soft and the foot-valve clogged
With the muck that has sifted through.
Drag them up by the willow log
And we’ll make them as good as new.
See that the belt is taut and true
And set in a level line;
For the cracked earth cries for the moisture
cool
From the bed of the Condamine.
The carbon’s cleaned from the engine-head,
And there isn’t a stain of rust;
We’ve oiled the bearings and ground the valves,
For in these we must place our trust.
The magneto kicks like an army mule,
And the weather is fair to fine;
So on with the belt and away we go,
Pumping the Condamine.
For a week or twoj or a month or two,
This is our daily job;
Tanking her up—cranking her up—
Marking her regular throb;
Shifting the pipes from row to row;
Laying them straight in line;
Coaxing the maize and Sudan to grow
Down by the Condamine.
The peewees bathe in the silver spray
That falls from the open jet;
Here is one spot in a burning world
That is cool and green and wet.
Ever the blistering sun beats down,
Ever the dry winds whine,
But the tassel shows on the corn to-day
Down by the Condamine.
The magneto kicks like a lusty mule;
From the bank where the willows grow,
Like the beat of a drum the exhaust beats come,
And the saving waters flow
In a stream of life down the three-inch pipe
To the end of the long-laid line.
Oh, the drought is down on a stricken land —•
Thank God for the Condamine!

I showed “James W.’s”
par. (B. 18/11/’36) to an old chap of
my acquaintance who is proud of his
18in. beard. Though forced to grudging
admiration for a 9ft. growth, he con-
tended that his chin and its adornment
were tougher than any man’s, and
offered to prove it by suspending his
entire weight on the ziff —me to do the
hoisting. I demurred, but the old chap
seemed to think his reputation was at
stake, so I climbed up, got one foot on
a dray wheel and the other on a ledge,
took a couple of half-hitches of dial
fungus around my hands and heaved. As
his feet cleared the floor he kicked his
heels and jerked about like a fish on a
line to show how he liked it. “I don’t
know about the hairs being tough,”
someone commented ; “but I’d say they
were very deep-rooted.”

C.H.F.”: There’s a common or
garden black-and-white duck in a M.L.
country town that for three seasons has
laid black-shelled eggs. In every other
way the eggs are perfectly normal. When
the duck commenced its shady practices
it was thought that a diet of charcoal
from a near-by smithy was the cause.
But the smithy has gone, and still the
duck lays black eggs.

‘Tver”: To what size, do prawns
grow? One caught at Urunga (North
Coast, N.S.W.) stretched the tape to
14jin. Disbelievers can view the pre-
served specimen at the Ocean View
Hotel,

“Bill O’C.”: I must decline all invita-
tions to dine with “Lucullus” (B.
2/12/’36) on his emu “fattened on a
cocky’s sprouting corn.” His theory is
that feed makes all the difference in
palatabilify. Then why are the mallee
hen and wild turkey, on practically the
same natural diet as the emu, so rightly
esteemed as table delicacies? The graz-
ing and fruit-eating deer are prized, but
apes on similar food are anathema; and
the graminivorous goose is offset by the
ostrich and emu, which pick the green
with him but belong to a wholly unre-
lated family.
“Peter Simple”: Anyone, know of an
exhibition of patience to beat that of
a gin waiting to catch her dinner? I
saw one in the Grafton (N.S.W.) dis-
trict chase a black snake into a hole in
the ground and then, waddy in hand, sit
down to wait for him. It was many
hours before his snakeship poked his
head out to see if the coast was clear,
but the gin’s waddy was still- there to
put an end to his investigations ; half an
hour later he had been cooked and
eaten. Abos. regard snakes as a delicacy,
but I have never known them to eat
one killed by a white man. I once saw
my father shoot a black snake and offer
it to a gin, but, though on the hunt for
her dinner, she refused the gift'. Snakes
were plentiful around our old home on
the Upper Clarence, and whenever one
was known to be under the house we
sent word to the blacks, and a gin was
soon on the job. In a waiting game the
snake lost every time.

“The 0.D.”: “Saddle-flap’s” old
major was right (B. 9/12/’36); a stiff
collar is much more comfortable and
cool in hot weather. The wretched
soft collar becomes wet with perspira-
tion and clings to the, neck with a grow-
ing constriction until the average bush-
man, wearing one of the confounded
things at a sale or some such affair,
finally rips it off. A stiff collar keeps
its distance from the skin, and allows
air to circulate. Anyhow, while we’re
on the subject, who was the maniac who
invented collars?
* * * *
“Boko”: Sixty miles from a garage
our car struck a nasty rut and presently
stopped. Bill, the driver, uncurled his
six feet two and got out, to find a com-
pound fracture in the petrol pipe leading
from the vacuum tank to the carbu-
rettor. “And we ain’t got a darned thing
on board to fix it with,” remarked Bill.
Thoughtfully taking a rifle from the back
seat he made off into the scrub. He
returned with a scrub turkey ; its wind-
pipe fitted as though made for the job,
and we carried on.
* * * *
“Bluegum”: Victoria, which has done
a lot toward preservation of the koala,
is to add to the reserves already estab-
lished to maintain the world-famous Aus-
tralian in his wild state. He is to have
a further considerable area adjoining the
Colin Mackenzie sanctuary at Heales-
ville, where for some years he has been
steadily increasing under conditions as
near as possible to those he enjoyed
before civilisation threatened him. Bears
are also increasing in the Phillip Island
and other reserved areas, and the Gov-
ernment’s wisdom in giving every assist-
'ance possible to preservation schemes is
in striking contrast to that of N.S.W. and
Queensland, where private enterprise is
left to do the best it can under heavy
handicaps for the unique and fast-
vanishing beastie.
* * * *
“Hanko”: A Sunday, and Newchum
and I were lounging in the barn read-
ing. Suddenly, with a fearsome yelp,
’Erb slapped shut his book and stam-
peded into the landscape, and I was just
in time to glimpse a goggle-eyed warty
lizard’s escape under a skirting board.
’Erb shambled back, grinned sheepishly,
and picked up his book. Again he yelped
in wild dismay. The gecko had left its
twitching tail as a book-mark! Pointing
to that acrobatic appendage, he stut-
tered ; “Thuth-thuth-thing had young ’un
in book, an’ all.”
* * * *
“Ursa”: The cabled story of a
crippled Canadian prospector who was
protected from wolves for a fortnight by
a bear until he was rescued reminds me.
Years ago I was overcome by the after-
effects of Diamantina Billy’s home-
distilled oblivion-bringer, special reserve,
and finally found myself exhausted, food-
less and drinkless in a patch of gums in
a secluded bend of the Thomson River.
I woke from a swoon to find I was sur-
rounded by bears, who gazed at me with
pitying eyes, and whom I judged to be
real from the fact that they weren’t
highly colored like the native fauna I
had come in contact with for several
days previously. I made gestures to
signify I wanted a drink, and after a
discussion the female bears deposited
their joeys with their male friends and,
going down to the river, returned with
filled pouches. This became a regular
routine. Food was a stiffer problem.
Finding I could not' stomach the tender-
est gum-tips or a long-defunct goanna
found by one of the party, the bears
went into conference, and next morning
I found a huge heap of watermelons,
tomatoes and other fruits beside me.
The kindly creatures had gone some 10
miles down the river in the night and
robbed a Chinaman’s garden there. It
was this that was responsible for my
rescue by my fellows. The Chow spotted
the melon rinds floating down the river,
into which I had thrown them, and
tracked me down. I told the story in full
detail to the beak at Longreach, where
the Chink charged me with stealing from
him, but he was no nature student and
handed me three moons with in Rocky.
* * * *
“Horsetailer”: Coolabah Ted, the old
boundary-rider, surprised the book-
keeper by handing him an alarm clock
to mend. “But what do you want to
know the time for, other than sun-up
and sun-down?” asked Books. “Blast
the time!” said old Ted; “I want the
blighter to tick and keep me company.”
*u* ■ *
“Mandurah”: An old dog for a hard
road! Out with old Alex, scouting for
boat knees in the tuart forest we found
a bent limb that promised half a dozen.
Putting up the crosscut to detach it from
the free I was checked. “No,” said
Alex., “just trim the top end and we’ll
rip it into slices while it’s still where it
is.” He was right: we ripped those knees
with ease. On the other hand, few things
are more provocative of sweat, bashed
hands and bad language than the rip-
ping of a short bend after it has been
detached from the;, tree.
THE BRUMBY.
I saw him first when I rode one morning
A dawn-lit plain where the brolgas danced,
And flitting plovers screamed loud their warn-
ing—-
A brumby stallion that wheeled and pranced
To get his mares and his foals together.
Head high, he faced me and whistled shrill;
Then turned and, light as a wind-blown
feather,
He led them racing across a hill.
The cool air rang to our hoofbeats’ rattle
As down the flank of a spur we raced
And woke and brought to their feet the cattle
Beneath the trees where the interlaced
And leafy apple-tree boughs gave shelter.
The camp broke up in a wild hubbub,
And up the flat in a helter-skelter
The brumbies won to the sheltering scrub.
And often after, as day was peeping
Across the plain where the brumbies fed,
1 raced again with the stallion keeping
His mares and foals in a mob ahead,
] sometimes fancied he liked the meeting
(A match of speed it had come to be)
As, fiery-maned in the dawn, his greeting
He whinnied shrill o’er the plain to me.
I saw him first in the dawn one morning. .*
I see him now in my dreams at night,
A golden horse with his challenge scorning
The mounted horse that would match his
flight.
I do not know where his bones are lying
Forgotten, bleached; but at least I hope
For old times’ sake that, however dying,
He never in life knew the touch of rope.

Headquarters are in London, and there
is a branch at Kenya, East Africa, but
most of the business, which is financed
largely on debenture money, is done in
Australia and Maoriland. The spring in
last year’s figures was due partly to the
rise in the price of wool—the co. is the,
world’s largest seller of the staple—and
partly to expanding turnover in the ex-
tensive merchandising, shipping and
general agency sections of the organisa-
tion.
Though the Australian clip was lighter,
the one in Maoriland was heavier, and,
in the aggregate, the co. put only 4776
fewer bales under the hammer, while the
average price for Australasia was £3 19s.

There was an increase of over nine mil-
lion bushels in the Australian wheat yield
(142.5 million bushels), and the average
price (3s. 7.7 d.) was 7d. per bushel
better ; bigger fish swam into the co.’s
many other nets, too.
After providing for bad and doubtful
debts and depreciation, there was a spring
of £98,341 in gross earnings:

The increase in salaries, etc., was on
account of the exchange cost of convert-
ing overseas profits into sterling
(£108,595, up £21,206). There was a
saving of £14,066 in interest, owing to
repayment of £273,654 of terminable de-
bentures. After passing £25,000 (up
£15,000) to the staff provident fund,
and handing the prefs. their 5 p.c.
(£25,000), enough remained to show
6.3 p.c. on the £1,500,000 of ord. capital,
compared with 1.4, 4.8, two losses, and
then profits of 0.7, 12.3 and 24.1 p.c. back
to 1929. That leaves out of the reckon-
ing the exchange cost (£100,000) on re-
mittances for debenture repayments,
which was charged direct to reserves.
The div. was lifted a point, making it
6 p.c., the final being at the rate of
1\ p.c. p.a.
When the books closed the preference
share and debenture capital combined
(£4,504,522) was costing the co. a shade
under 4.4 p.c. This was cheap money
during the boom, and was very helpful to
the ords. —they received a regular 17 p.c.
for the half-dozen years to the close of
accounts in 1929 ; lately it has been more
of a hindrance than a help, though the
position in this respect is improving. In-
cluding debenture interest (£173,016) and
the staff fund contribution, last year’s
net earnings (£318,867) were, 4.23
p.c. on debenture and share capital and
reserves combined (£7426,640). Also,
over the last six years exchange has cost
the co. £703,060, of which £404,814 has
been charged to reserves.
The financial structure is solid:

book value of premises, cash and invest-
ments were drawn upon for £279,531,

£34,692 and stocks by £46,268. Advances,
properties, etc., were down £8854. Cash
and investments alone more than cover
the floating debt, which includes an un-
specified provision for contingencies and
taxation.
With wool and wheat and other prices
as they are, prospects of a better show-
ing at next balance are heartening. At
£lO 15s. (£8 10s. a year ago) the £2O ords.
paid to £5 return Australian and Maori-

Governing director Confoy resigned last
month “in accordance, with the terms of
his agreement,” whatever they might be,
and A. Aubrey, the general manager,
will carry out the combined duties of the
two offices as managing director. What-
ever saving there may be to the co. will
largely depend upon the terms of Mr.
Confoy’s agreement.
From the start the co. pursued a
policy of vigorous but expensive cam-
paigning, which included purchase of the
A.P.A.’s S. African business, what was
left of the New Era (heavy lapses and
high costs crippled it) and the life con-
tracts of the Australian Group and
General. When the books closed in 1934,
the book value of net tangibles ex-
ceeded the Life fund by £40,612, which
was practically all there was, except in-
tangibles, to represent the £300,000 of
share capital; and regular bonuses to
policy-holders and divs. to shareholders
were still round the corner. So the
board decided to “restrict the costly
writing of new business,” and the 1935
figures show that it made an encourag-
ing start. The reorganisation of the co.
is now claimed to be complete “in ac-
cordance with the directors’ plan,” and
the intention is “to gradually increase
the writing of new business in the future,
without incurring additional overhead.”
The idea is sound enough; it should
mean, among other things, further re-
duction of costs.
Now consider these figures:
1930. 1935. 1936.
Proposals accepted .. 7,737 3,033 2,690
Total new policies .. £2,112,311 £733,604 £604,043

Interest, rent, etc... 17,306 25,342 31,095
Total income .. 223,797 190,425 186,596
The amount of new business put on the
books during the last term was £129,561
less than for the previous year, making
the contraction £611,316 over the last
two years. Surrenders (£26,662) were
£1284 lighter. The shrinkage in net pre-
mium income, etc. (£155,501), was £9582.
Interest, etc., was up £5753, leaving
total income only £3829 lighter. Ex-
cluding interest payments (£3271) and
taxes (£2259), exes. (£63,124) took 40.5
p.c. of the year’s net premiums, etc., as
against 40.3 p.c. and 49.8 p.c. for the.
two preceding years. The ratio needs
to be reduced a lot yet before the posi-
tion can be regarded as really satisfac-
tory.
Thus far the co. has assumed that its
funds will turn in 4 p.c. After deduct-
ing interest and taxation, the net effec-
tive return on the mean Life fund last
year was £4 3s. lOd. p.c. as against
£3 13s. lid. p.c. in 1935.
The third quinquennial overhaul of
the business by the actuary is now in
progress. The report is to be made avail-
able next month; until then it cannot
be stated precisely where policy-holders
and shareholders stand.
The protection for policy-holders and
shareholders is in this form:

It used to be a money-spinner, but the
talkies, broadcasting and economic de-
velopments have completely changed the
outlook for the legitimate stage. A
couple of years ago it was decided to
cancel arrears of pref. divs. (£40,575),
and to reduce the rate of dividend from
8 p.c. (6.2 p.c. after allowing for the
statutory cut) to 6 p.c. cumulative, with
the right to advance with the ords. up to
8 p.c., after the latter have had 6 p.c.
In return the prefs. received 20,000 f.-p.
pref. shares, reserves being capitalised
for the purpose, thus making 6 p.c.
worth 6.8 p.c. on old holdings. At the
same time the directors reduced aggre-
gate payments under their service agree-
ments from £13,390 p.a. to £9360 p.a.
from Dec. 1, 1932, to July 3, 1937. Mean-
while, after the prefs. have had 6 p.c.
and the ords. 3 p.c. (together £21,450),
the. first £4030 of any annual surplus is
to be used to restore the cut in the ser-
vice agreements just referred to.
The betterment in net earnings over
the, last few years has been due partly
to improvement in conditions generally
and’ partly to lightening of the co.’s
burden through the sale and leasing of
surplus properties and rearrangement of
the debt structure, etc. During the last

to pay a full year’s pref. div. (£10,200)
and show 4.2 p.c. on ord. capital. Actu-
ally, the prefs. were handed £15,300,
bringing their payments up to the close
of accounts, and, for the sixth year in
succession, the ords. were passed by.
That leaves out of the reckoning a
profit of £4022 realised in connection
with the, sale of the co.’s shareholding in
the Theatre Royal Pty., Melbourne.
Prospects of further improvement in
earnings depend largely upon satisfactory

This well-handled business is spread
throughout the Commonwealth and
Maoriland. Two-fifths of the £750,000
of share capital is bonus scrip, handed
out in 1919, when £135,000 of capital
was also returned. Soon competition
from reinforced concrete and imported
timbers began to affect earnings, and
then, weakened by the prolonged
struggle, slump sent a number of small
timber-traders to the wall and the
market became flooded with liquidation
stocks, making it impossible for the sur-
vivors to earn satisfactory profits on
their share capital, notwithstanding that
the said capital was often assisted by
substantial reserves.
For the decade to the close of ac-
counts in 1935 shareholders in this
Kauri Co. averaged 2>\ p.c. ; but re-
serves had to be tapped for no less than
£142,766 to pay the meagre distribu-
tions and cover trading and other
losses. The tide turned about four years
ago, and has continued to rise since,
thanks to the activity in home and other
building. Gross earnings, which had
fallen to £40,669 in 1930, rose to £129,998
last year, when the increase was £24,657.
Including allowances for taxation
(£17,846, up £7707) and depreciation
(£21,107, up £8415, shown as written off
in the table), exes, were £22,100 heavier
at £87,529. The net result was thus a
profit of £42,469, or 5.6 p.c. on capital
as against 5.3, 2.7, 1.3 p.c. and losses
of £25,950 and £10,400 back to 1931. The
div. was kept at 5 p.c.

AMERICAN INDUSTRY
AMAZING COMPARISONS.
In attempting to measure the extent of business recovery mathematically,
the Goodyear Statistical Department revealed that in the manufacturing
industries of America there were only 18 per cent, fewer people employed
than in 1929.
Cash income from farms, the Goodyear Statistician said, is 27 per
cent, below the peak. Retail prices are 19 per cent, below, but the volume
of retail sales was 27 below, and freight-car loadings 32 per cent, below.
The construction industry, which has seen the largest amount of unem-
ployment by any major group, was still slightly less than half what it was
in 1929.
Looking ahead next year, there were indications of a 50 per cent,
increase in the building industry, increases in volume of transportation, in
real estate values, in farm income, stock values, wages, corporation earnings
and retail business. He predicted also increases in prices, rents and taxes.
Income from bonds indicated no change.
In the rubber industry he saw increases in consumption of crude rubber,
in cotton ; 10 per cent, increase in production of new cars, 20 per cent,
in new trucks, 50 per cent, in bicycles and 100 per cent, in trailers.
In 1929 less than nine per cent, of motor-cars were more than seven
years old. Now 36 per cent, are older models, and only 15 per cent, of the
cars driven this year are 1936 models. People drove their cars longer
during the depression before trading them in. With an improved situation
now, more than two million cars are going on the scrapheap this year.
Total tyre production this year in U.S.A. will reach 52,000,000 as against
70,000,000 in 1928 and a low level of 39,000,000 in 1932. Tyres for original
equipment will make up 22,000,000 this year, the highest in history, but this
is partly due to the fact that car manufacturers now generally furnish a
spare tyre with a new car. An increase of 12 per cent, in tyres for original
equipment is seen for next year, with an increase of only two per cent, on
renewal tyres.
Tyres continue to last longer, he pointed out. In 1915 a car used an
average of eight tyres per year. When the cord tyre came in, it gave so much
longer mileage that the average was cut down to two tyres per year ; and
with further improvements is down to one and a half. A factor in this is the
increasing size of tyres. Where the small cars used a three-inch tyre in
1915, they are now using a six-inch tyre—with a price only half what the
smaller tyre cost, and many times the mileage.
Improvement in business recovery in countries outside the United
States is proceeding faster than in that country. Using 1928 as a basis,
he showed the world as a whole 13 per cent, above that average, and
United States three per cent, below it: lapan is 73 per cent, above, England
14 above, Germany nine above, Canada six per cent, below.
Other statistics quoted by the Goodyear Statistician were:
The United States and Canada between them purchase four out of
five new motor-cars built in the world.
The City of Cleveland alone has more cars registered than any foreign
country except six.
United States has more than one car to every five people. Ethiopia
has one to every 17,000.
Tyres use 61 per cent, of all the world’s rubber in money value,
mechanical goods 18 per cent., boots and shoes nine per cent., soles and
heels three.
Rubber was a £100,000,000 industry in 1929, while the world spent half
—£50,000,000 —for rubber products this year.

The International Tin Committee has
reduced the production quota from 105
p.c. to 100 p.c. of standard (1929) ton-
nages for the first quarter of 1937.
This is the first quota fixed under
the new five-year control agreement,
whereby Siam has been given a quota
of 18,500 tons p.a. as against' 12,500
tons previously. Visible supplies of the
metal at the end of November were
10,864 tons, or 2463 tons less than they
were a month earlier. For the 12 months
to the end of September, world con-
sumption of tin is put at 153,751 tons
as against 134,916 tons for the preceding
year.- For the corresponding periods,
recorded world production was 166,032
tons and 124,585 tons respectively. The
present international quota provides for
a production of approximately 190,000
tons annually. The London spot price
of the metal, which fell from £232 in
Sept., 1935, to £176 in June last, and
averaged £194 17s. 7d. for Sept., was
£236 17s. 6d. on Dec. 16. The figure
may go higher still, if the demand for
tin continues to increase in the new
year. The danger in propping the figure
at too high a level is that it forces a
search for substitutes. In this connec-
tion, efforts are already being made in
the U.S.A. to use plastics for containers.

According to cable advice, Sulphide
Corp. netted £91,068 for the year to
June 30, or £1279 less than for the pre-
vious term, although there was a rise in
metal prices. Capital is £1,050,000 in
600,000 £1 10 p.c. non.-cumulative par-
ticipating prefs. and a like number of
fully-paid 15s. ords. Divs. of 10 p.c. to
the prefs. and 5 p.c. to the ords. (10
p.c. and 2\ p.c. respectively for the pre-
vious term) took £82,500. Activities
were confined to the Central mine, at
Broken Hill, and the Cockle Creek
works, near Newcastle, which turn out
cement, super, and sulphuric acid. The
co. also quarries limestone at Attunga
(N.S.W.). At the end of June, 1935, ore
reserves at the Central were put at
568,220 tons, giving the mine a life of
about four years on a treatment basis
of 140,000 tons p.a. In 1934 the board
said that part, at least, of the pref.
capital would be repaid from surplus
liquids (over £700,000 at June 30, 1935),
after the co.’s liabilities under the N. S.
Wales Workers’ Compensation Act had
been determined by the Government, and
provided no satisfactory new employ-
ment could be found for the money.
The market prices the ords. at 17s. and

Mt. Morgan Developments, Ltd.,
which for the last two years has been
running the rule over many Australasian

meeting with anything startling, has
thrown off Morgan Tennants, Ltd., with
a nominal capital of £75,000 to investi-
gate 16 areas distinct from those the
parent has applied for at Tennants Creek,
Centralia. Here the diamond-drill re-
cently disclosed indications of values liv-
ing to much greater depth than early
anticipations suggested. The location of
the field, however, makes it a high-cost
one. Preliminary work will be done by
the Development Co. on behalf of its
pup, in which a block of shares is to be
reserved for subscription by those on the
Development Co.’s register.

With better yields resulting from the
deepening of the paddock on the Con-
solidated claims, Sunshine Gold De-
velopment (N.G.), floated in September
of last year, hopes to declare an early
div. On the Consolidated areas over
2,000,000 c.y. has been proved, valued
at £400,000 with gold at £8 10s. an
ounce. From Aug. 1, when production
began here, to Nov. 30 13510 z. gold,
worth £B7Bl, was obtained. Altogether,
the co. holds 252 acres of alluvial flats—
-30 acquired last term —principally along
the Watut. The Sunshine leases proved
a washout and were abandoned, while
the Undaunted, where production is
shortly to commence, has been let on
tribute. For the year to July 31 expen-
diture amounted to £21,453 ; liabilities
(£9083) then exceeded current assets by
£3529.

Including £470 of sundry revenue,
Bulolo Gold Deposits’ income for the
year to June 30 was £4385 ; field expen-
diture swallowed £4771 and general exes.
£lOO2, making a net loss of £1387, as
against a profit of £lOB5 in the previous
term. Increased production in the cur-
rent term is mirrored in the gold yield
of 16490 z. for the period July 1-Nov.

of last year. Recent clean-ups compare

With cash and bullion in hand at June
30 amounting to £7348 and liabilities
of only £945, a div. now appears to be
on the horizon, provided values hold.
For £3500 Bulolo has acquired Morobe
Alluvials’ 3,000,000 c.y. block, through
which its water-race runs. Though
as yet untested, the area yielded the
vendor co. 1005 oz. from 44,995 yards —
an average 2s. 3d. Of Bulolo’s other N.G.
interests testing on the Wau terraces and
Flat Creek areas has indicated “extensive
payable yardages.” A dredging area at
Graytown (Vic.) is also being investi-
gated. To eliminate a p. and 1. debit of
£25,987 assets were written up £25,000
during the year. To Placer Development
for £lO,OOO the co. also disposed of 210
acres which had cost it £2OOO. The share-
register total is £41,784 in 2s. shares, for
which the market pays 2s. 2d.
4= 4= * *
Owing to better recoveries (7.4 d., up
2.6 d.), increased yardage (458,500,
against 400,750) and lower costs (2.72 d.,
down .27d.), Adelong Gold Estates (Vic.)
discloses net profits £3490 higher at
£7593 for the six months to Oct. 30. Gold
won (16890 z.) turned in £14,151, of which
operating costs absorbed £5205. Divs.
of £1875 were paid, and a further Is.—
6d. labelled bonus —has gone out since
the accounts closed. Including 67 acres
recently acquired, the co. holds some
478 acres of dredging ground in the
Ovens Valley, 60 to 70 acres of which
has now been worked. The original area
was estimated to average between 2gr.
and 3gr. ,a yard. If recoveries and costs
remain as at present, shareholders will
fare a lot better as yardage is increased ;
they had a lean time for some years
after the co. abandoned its N.S.W. prop-
erty in 1928.

Yellowdine, richest of De Bernales’s
Westralian group, has produced its first
£lOO,OOO worth of gold from 27,000 tons
of ore. It took exactly six months to do
this. Tailings are estimated to contain
over £BO,OOO worth of bullion, and a
cyanide plant will shortly commence to
leach most of it out. The holding co.,
Yellowdine Gold Development, hopes to
declare, about the middle of 1937, a div.
large enough to repay the whole of the
capital invested by shareholders, chiefly
London-controlled Westralian goldmin-
ing cos. associated with the De Bernales
group. Developments at and above the
200 ft. level are officially reported to be
right, and recent borehole results “cannot
fail to be a source of the greatest satis-
faction to all those who hold interests in
the property.” Sinking below 250 ft. has
been suspended pending installation of
more powerful pumping plant.

Wiluna Gold Corp. netted £146,980
(down £142,262) last year. The drop in
profit was due to a decline in the grade
of ore milled by Wiluna Gold Mines,

Water as well as beer continues in
keen demand on the Kalgoorlie Golden
Mile. During the year ended Sept. 30
last the mining cos. operating there
purchased water to the tune of
£112,985, of which Lake View paid
£60,514, Great Boulder £10,550, Per-

£10,996, Golden Horseshoe £6508 and
South Kalgurli about the same amount.
The quantity of water now consumed,
principally in ore treatment, at Kal-
goorlie is more than double that used
before gold soared in price.

Christmas Spirit Precautions.
While there is plenty of advice pub-
lished on the subject of Christmas
, , 1 . ■ .. ,
presents, menus, entertainments, etc., the
guide-books are silent on the most im-
portant matter—how to prevent the
Yuletide spirit getting a hold on one.
Without such guidance weak-minded
persons are likely to find themselves
being carried away by their emotions
into the new year, and being involved in
such social gaucheries as paying the
rent twice, giving all employees a rise
or shouting regularly for complete
strangers in the wash-house.
“The patient is despondent, doctor. He cant eat,”
“ That's all right, nurse —Well have those bandages off in a couple of
Weeks.”
Keep your head even during the most
reckless Christmas festivities. Fight
against the urge to be a good fellow,
Tell yourself that people are only mak-
ing a fuss of you to try to force reck-
less habits on you.
If is the duty of heads of families to
discourage its members in extravagance,
Express the idea that the day of reckon-
ing is nigh by the prominent display of
the Bankruptcy Court calendar and
Chinese famine scenes.

“I tell you I listened to how he
smacked him to the fence. Then he
punched him through the covers. The
poor man! And cut him twice in suc-
cession. The cowardly bully! And the
other poor fellow O’Reilly suffered, too.
The brute used a straight bat to him, so
the man on the wireless said, and after
banging him to the fence lifted him over
the heads of the fieldsmen to the out-
field.”
“But if you let me explain”
“Oh, I know you! You revel in such
sheer brutality! There was another
man, Leystaff or somebody, skied an-
other poor fellow and then chopped him
into the wicket. He was out for that —
it' was quite time they put him out. They
ought to have locked him up! And then
they went on playing when a dreadful
thing like that had happened—a man
chopped into the wicket!”
“But that means”
“Do you take me for a child? Don’t
you think I know the English language?

them! I think it’s positively disgust” -

Courses—and Effects.
I noted with satisfaction recently the
generous action of a homing traveller
who, finding that some foreigners at his
shipboard table were experiencing diffi-
culty with the menu, ordered their meals
for them. This courtesy to one’s fellow
travellers, especially to those less gifted
linguistically than myself, I invariably
practise during my extensive globe trot-
tmgs -
Not always, however, do these unselfish
actions get the appreciation they merit,
I recall one occasion on which I was
travelling on a French liner. My fellow
diner the first night out was a man
named Lars Bjornsen, a Swiss prob-
ably, although I never actually heard him
yodel. A huge, rather uncouth fellow,
he was a professional boxer I learned
later. The. menu, of course, was in
French and apparently seeing the savoir-
hich I ordered my roast beef
(as it bores me picking over the many
French dishes _ j £ yer J ave anything bl / t
roast beef—called rosbif— when the
menu j s i n French), Bjornsen looked at
me with such a dumb appeal that I felt
impelled to assist him. With raised eye-
brows I pointed to the menu and he
nodded eagerly. Then, with swift de-
cision, I ticked off the various courses
to the white-coated waiter standing at
his elbow.
I selected the viands which I thought
would appeal to his obviously robust
appetite. I forget just what they were,
but I remember that one of the dishes
was a thing called Veuve Clicquot, and
some stuff, Meet I think it was, was the
entree. The soup, I believe, was called
absinthe —at least, I heard someone at
the next table say something about my
friend indulging in lunatic soup, although
he certainly didn’t use a spoon. The fish,
if I recall aright, was Perrier Jouet,
probably a kind of jewfish, and the
savory Heidsieck monopole sec. I also
ordered Orphee aux Enfers, but I was
so entranced with the band’s playing of
Offenbach’s “Orpheus in Hades” that I

expensive tastes, too, for champagne
seemed to be his forte. The dinner I
ordered for him apparently took a good
deal of preparation, but once he started
on the drinks he forgot about the non-
arrival of food. He guzzled, I thought
rather vulgarly, and soon he was mag-
nificently shot and insisted on my help-

about it, and such is the baseness of
human ingratitude that when it was con-
veyed to his meagre intelligence by an
officer called in to quell the disturbance
that it was I who assisted him to select
his dinner, the brute slung what I under-

a right cross at me. As they say in the
press accident notices, “three stitches

Ord. shares in Mauri Bros, and Thom-
son should be good buying at last week’s
quote of 725. The yield here, on the
present 15 p.c. div. basis, is 4.1 p.c.,
which is a trifle above the return on
Consols, and the co. last year could
have paid 26 p.c. on ord. capital out of
the term’s disclosed profits before appro-
priations were made to reserves. There
are reasons for believing that the parent’s
p. and 1. figures don’t fully exhibit the
earnings of its several subsidiaries. Nearly
every bottle that goes out of a brewery
or cordial factory has a Crown seal for
a stopper —and Mauri Bros, distribute
this line. Milk-bar fittings, soda-foun-
tain gadgets, butchers’ plant, corks, vine-
gar, malt products and groceries are
among the many items handled by the

Berlei ords. dropped to 375. last week.
The yield is 5.4 p.c.—quite an attractive
one, and, on past experience, as safe as
most, though there are some who will
say that Fashion, a fickle jade, is likely
to play fast and loose with profits.
Berlei’s, however, have shown full ability
to cope with fashions in the past.
Finances are particularly sound.
* * * *
The failure of the latest Common-
wealth loan, said by some to be due to
the abdication of Edward VIII., can be
traced principally to less _ romantic
causes. It flopped because investors don’t
like Consols at current rates of interest,
and because to-day’s yield is higher than
yesterday’s, and to-morrow’s will be still
higher—which means loss of market
value. The banking position, which is
really disturbing—principally because of
over-importing—is forcing higher interest
rates all round. Lack of co-operation by
leading institutions and by Governments,
together with Government overspending,
is resulting in a dangerous drift in
national finance. All will suffer if the
slide isn’t arrested.
The Rising Tide of Interest
It will be a bad day—perhaps in the
not-so-distant future—for sharemarket
speculators when some of the golden-
haired favorites of the Stock Exchange
quotation lists fail to bring forth what.
is anticipated in the way of increased
dividends, etc. For it is absolutely cer-
tain that the present return from many
stocks does not by itself justify market
prices. Only the prospect of bigger
profits, increased divs., bonuses and
greater market support (which means
market profits) has prompted the quota-
tion of Australian ordinary shares at a
high level never before exceeded in the
country’s history. If hopes fade, so
will prices.
It is just as well to remind speculators
that money made on the industrial share-
market over the past few years was due
in no small measure to the falsely low
estimate of value put on investments
when we had Lang and the depression.
Since Lang went out of office there
has been such a sustained rise in ordi-
nary-share values that it has been com-
paratively easy for the discerning to
make money on the market. Though
a state of affairs that comes only once
in a generation, it is still bringing flocks
of people into the pool. One of the
things that helped kick prices of div.-
paying stocks up in 1934 was falling
interest rates. Then there came better
wool and other prices, a revival in em-
ployment, and real recovery.
It wasn’t so long ago that this page
was the scene of a controversy on “Idle
Men and Idle Money”—a debate as to
the best means of bringing surplus labor
into contact with surplus capital. At
that time banks were embarrassed with
excess fixed deposits, and unemploy-
ment' was still very high. Just over
two years ago; and now, partly be-
cause of remarkable industrial recovery,
but largely because of excessive imports,
the banks are scratching for money to
fill clients’ wants, and unemployment has
been halved.
With the revival in employment a lot
of money has shifted from trading-bank
to savings-bank accounts, and this has
meant more finance for long-term bor-
“’ Ullo, Dig, is Braddles still baitin'?"
rowers and less for trade purposes. It
means that the credit created by the trad-
ing banks hasn’t all come back to them
in the shape of new deposits. And what
it is going to mean in the near future,
unless the trend of things changes
abruptly, is generally higher interest rates. -
The mood of the sharemarket is always
tempered by the cost of borrowing. When
one can get a certain income from £lOO
deposited in a bank, one demands a
higher immediate or prospective return
from other investments. Fixed-interest
securities —Consols, pref. shares, mort-
gages and debentures —have already re-
flected the rising tide of interest.. The
one thing that has saved ord.-share
prices from drooping has been the
higher divs. paid on such shares.
If interest rates looked like remaining
stable the, outlook would be clearer.
Wool, wheat and metal prices are now
very promising. Our overseas trade bal-
ance, however, has a dissipated appear-
ance, banks are tightening up, and sub-
scribers to new Commonwealth loans
who have seen their stock go quickly to
a discount are crying “Enough!” almost
before the Loan Council meets in June
and December each year.
The interest dog is, in fact, chasing its
tail. It is a rather crazy and unmanage-
able dog under present push-and-tug con-
trol. Ordinary shares in good industrial
concerns are probably the best invest-
ment in Australia. But many people
are not buying them as investments ; they
are holding for market' rises, and are
often financed on borrowed money. Ris-
ing interest will sooner or later catch up
with dividend increment in a number of
cases, and, as “carrying” charges usually
cost more than the present yield on most
industrials, there will be some forced
selling. The wise course is to pick good
stocks giving a favorable yield, and to
rely on your own funds as far as.pos-
sible.
American money is opening up the Big
Bell gold show, near Cue,-W.A. —largely
with the aid of Australian machinery.
Chas. Ruwolt Pty., Victoria, a concern
which does about 80 p.c. of the mining-
equipment work in Australia and Fiji,
last week dispatched the largest con-
signment of plant ever sent to an Aus-
tralian mine ; a vessel was specially char-
tered to deliver the lot at' Geraldton.
Four large ball-mills and two primary
ore-breakers” are included in the parcel
weighing more than 500 tons. Ruwolts
have previously delivered and erected the
steel buildings, etc., at Big Bell, and a
head-frame 115 ft. high is now being
made. The Yanks are shrewd buyers,
and it is a compliment to any Austra-
lian concern to get such a contract.
Ruwolts successfully competed with the
world in getting orders .for a large part
of the Emperor and Loloma equipment
in Fiji. * , Y

If Australasian Paper ords. are. worth
the 365. 6d; paid in Melbourne and
Sydney last week, Cumberland ords. are
cheap at 30s. The present yields at those
prices are 4.4 p.c. and 5.3 p.c. respec-
tively. A.P. ords., by reason of the
greater proportion of pref. capital in
Cumberland, A.P.’s slightly bigger pro-
portionate holding in the operating co.,
and the same co.’s wider investment
market, are worth perhaps 2s. a share
more than Cumberland. But not 6s. 6d.
more.

Associated Pulp and Paper ords., paid
to 10s., are changing hands at Bs. This
is the concern, backed by the Broken
Hill cos., which is to make fine writing-
and printing-paper at Burnie JTas.). To
those who have a fancy for an interest
in a future paper industry the present
discount on the . scrip represents an
opportunity. A; couple of years must
elapse before anything in the way of a
return is likely to appear on the horizon ;
but that is the way of all big new enter-
prises.

Bank of N. S. Wales shares, marked
down to a point out of keeping with
general share values following remarks
at the annual meeting, made quick re-
covery from the low level of £33 12s. 6d.
touched on Dec. 8. They rose to £35
15s. again last week.
* * * *
The lift in metals left many people a
little short of breath last week. Spelter
nearly £l9 sterling a ton, and lead over
£26! Not since before the slump have
such figures been seen. Standard copper
was over £46, with electrolytic above
£5O. Tin has had a duller market, prob-
ably because supply has caught up with
demand—there has been a slight reduc-
tion in the quota. North Broken Hill ss.
shares lifted to the record figure of 725.,
Souths to 445. 9d. Mt. Lyell was firmer,
and some tin stocks were up.
For the five years to June, 1929, the
average price of lead was £2O Bs. sterling,
spelter £3O 7s. For the
12 months to June
last the averages were
£l6 4s. and £l5 4s.
respectively. If prices
go neither higher nor
lower than last week’s
it will be a wonderful
year for Barrier mines,
allowed freedom from
labor troubles, etc.
Still, even if North
paid 120 p.c. divs. reg-
ularly it would take 12
years to return the
present market price,
and if South handed
out 100 p.c. p.a. share-
holders would start to
show a profit only after
nine years. War possi-
bilities are undoubt-
edly influencing present metal quota-
tions ; and if war comes there will prob-
ably be a big jump in labor and other
mining costs.
* * * *
Fine gold was steady at £7 Is. 9d. an
ounce in London last week. The re-
covery from £6 16s. should mean a
matter of £30,000 a year to Wiluna.
* * * *
In Melbourne last week:
Olympic Tyres lifted to 41s. 9d., with
holders reluctant to part at the price. Broken
Hill Prop, recovered to 82s. 6d., and was
keenly bought. Carlton changed hands at
635. 6d., holding most of the recent gain, while
Australasian Paper ords. recovered much of
the ground lost after the new share-issue was
made.
Holeproof ords. kept steady around 295.,
in anticipation of better results for the year
now closing.
G. J. Coles ords. steadied at 90s. 6d., after
a very strong market since the increased div.
was announced.
Yarra Falls shares were quickly taken when-
ever offered at 40s. 9d.

fies 0 f firebricks; but, coming from a
constructional trade, investors regard the
]Q p.c. div. as not being as safe as, say,
Clifford Love’s. Ex rights, the £1 shares
are now at 355. 6d.
Howard Smith ord. shares firmed to
225. 6d. in Melbourne last week. The
co. has around 200,000 shares in
8.H.P., worth, at the present market,
over £BOO,OOO in a paid capital of
£2,250,000. The co.’s shipping and sugar
investments are earning more, and in
view of the proposed stabilisation of
N.S.W. coal prices in the new year in-
terests in Caledonian and Invincible may
become more valuable. Highest recent
price for the ords. was 235., in
November.

The new plant of Morning Star
(Wood’s Point, Vic.) is now in full swing.
The battery has been in regular operation,
and since December 10 the fine-grinding
and flotation sections have been at work
on tailings. Burns’s floor is expected
to keep the mill supplied with ore for
some time to come ; developments on
Whitelaw’s floor give hopes of reserves
being considerably augmented. Geo-
logical examination of the dyke forma-
tion which comprises the mine is still in
progress, and further discoveries are
hoped for. The co.’s shares have been
steady at slightly above 4s. for some
time.

Koitaki Rubber lifted to 265. 6d. last
week on reports of a further strengthen-
ing in the. commodity on overseas
markets. The yield at the interim (10

growing is a speculative business, this
co. must be doing exceptionally well just
now.

The sharemarket accepted the pro-
posed ninepenny distribution by British
Tobacco on Jan. 29 in the. terms in which
it ,was declared—as a bonus. Quota-
tions for the ords. lifted 9d. (to 475. 6d.)
last Wednesday, giving a yield of 3.3 p.c.
on an 8 p.c. basis, though actually the
year’s distribution, with the bonus, will
be Ilf p.c. The bit extra is coming out
of profits of subsidiaries accumulated in
past years, which doesn’t encourage the
hope of repetition ; but supporters of the
stock seem to think that current earn-
ings will stand higher divs. later on. A
3.3 p.c. yield by itself is not a satisfac-
tory return.


RANDWICK RACES
SUMMER MEETING, 1936
19th and 26th DECEMBER.
SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
A surprise scratching for the A.J.C.
Villiers Stakes was Distinguished. He
had been one of the favorites since the
first appearance of the weights, but the
stable had two in the race and gave the
preference to Golden Chance, Distin-
guished being reserved for the High-
weight Handicap. He is in the Carring-
ton Stakes (with 7st. 51b.); Golden
Chance is not.
E- A. Haley’s King's Head won the
Villiers, threequarters of a length to
Prittle Prattle, a length to Lancaster
King. Bartle got the bay horse well
away on the inside, held a handy place
to the straight and there ran down Sal
Volatile and held off Prittle Prattle
fairly comfortably. Mananui was an un-
lucky fourth. He. had a bad passage and
made up a lot of ground to get there.
* >:< * *
A Summer Cup review:
Oro (9st. 21b.): Now an old stallion and may
have seen his best day. Still, you never know.
Auto Buz (Bst. 81b.): A good Queensland
horse with a liking for Randwick. Failed in
the Queensland Cup, but was interfered with.
Well up to weight, and should be capable of
going a mile and five
f urlongs.
Wykeham (Bst. 81b.):
A close second in the
St. Leger to Allunga,
so he is another whom
the distance should not
trouble. Anything but
a brilliant finisher, be-
ing a one-pace horse,
but very well just now.
High Cross (Bst. 71b.):
Fourth in the Metro-
politan, but his summer
form has been below
that standard.
Egmont (Bst.. 61b.) :
The best-handicapped
horse in the race.
Second in the Sydney
Cup as a three-year-old
and favorite for the
Metropolitan until he
went wrong. The only
doubt about Egmont is
whether he has done
sufficient work.
Young Crusader (Bst.
61b.): Trained for
winter, spring and sum-
mer racing, which is un-
usual. After that tre-
mendous effort in the
Melbourne Cup this
chestnut will be a
wonder if he wins.
Upoko Ariki (Bst.
31b.): A good horse a
year or two ago, but
may not be sufficiently
seasoned.
Satmoth (Bst. 21b.): A
hardy old plodder and
looking very nice just
now. A chance.
El Senorita (7st.
101 b): Second to Young
Crusader in the A.J.C.
Winter Plate, and has
won two fair races since. Another that’s
looking very well. Is by no means out of it.
Lancaster King (7st. 71b.): The journey seems
a bit far for this old chap. He would be en-
titled to greater consideration if it were a
mile and “three.”
Jovial Son (7st. 61b.): Is bred to stay, has
run third in a mile-and-a-half race at Rand-
wick and has won twice recently in good style.
Whatever beats him should win.
Latharna (7st. 51b.): In another month’s time
perhaps.
Gippsland (7st. 51b.): A stayer, but rather
stricken in years.
Sir Ross (6st. 111 b.): An improving young
horse, but perhaps deficient in class.
H* H< sfc H*
The theory of the writer of the “Pick-
ing ’Em” articles that this climatically
irregular season will be a very good
season for racing fillies and mares is
being borne out. Of seven races at Men-
tone three were won by young mares —
divisions of the Trial Handicap by
Dunloe (Great Star-Sweet Echo) and
Casarka (Gay Lothario-Cool Pet), and
the Heatherton Handicap by Nissa
(Drake-Pistilla).
Splendid form has been struck by the
Windbag filly, Dame Chatter, who fol-
lowed up her Bendigo success by com-
fortably beating Humorist and Coveshaw
in the Welter Handicap at Caulfield.
She could not ask Siren to gallop in
engagements for three-year-old fillies in
the spring, but might put up a good
fight with Bailey Payten’s flyer if they
were to meet now over seven furlongs
or a mile.
He $ $ $
Dame Chatter was second favorite for
the Oaks. She led for about a mile and
a quarter, but that was sufficient; she
wilted when tackled by Siren. As a rule,
Oaks form is not of much account, but
this year it deserves serious consideration.
Siren up to a mile and a quarter will
make the best of the colts—even the
£19,000 one —travel, and Korimako
(third) looks like winning good handi-
caps in Sydney up to a mile or a mile
and a quarter. And Iva, the runner-up,
is apparently pretty good.
Ike Foulsham, nephew of the veteran
Sydney trainer of that name, won the
Audrey Bowen Flandicap at Caulfield
last Thursday with Plankton, a five-year-
“If you go in, girls, it's at your own risk. I'm of duty now.”
old stallion by Chivalrous-Nekton.
Starting favorite, Plankton registered
an easy victory. He is trained by Fred
Foulsham, for whom Ike the younger
acts as foreman.
Lautus (Silvius-Lave a Fond) atoned
for his failure at the Bendigo Cup meet-
ing by landing a division of the. Hos-
pital Trial Handicap. A pot of money
was lost over him at Bendigo, which ac-
counts for the nice odds of 5 to 1 being
obtainable at “the Heath.” He belongs to
H. N. Leonard,, who carried off the G.N.
Hurdle a few years ago with Cockcrow.
Trainer is R. Bradfield, whose Fleming-
ton stable turned out such a bevy of
Cup winners.
* * * *
There is every promise of good sport
at Flemington on New Year’s Day. For
the Standish Handicap 32 entries were
received, this being exactly on a par with
the total for the previous season. Bagot
Handicap nominations advanced from
22 to 26.
The only inter-State entries for the
Standish and Bagot —apart from Adel-
aide horses already located in Melbourne
—were Young Crusader for the Standish
and Magnus for the long race. It is
difficult to visualise Young Crusader as
a sprinter. Opinion arose in the mind
of sporting writers in the city on the
Yarra that a clerical mistake had been
made and that Young Crusader was in-
tended for the Bagot.
Likelihood of Garrio, winner of the
1935 Williamstown Cup, being seen in
action again before long is strengthened
by Lou Robertson having entered A. T.
Creswick’s good galloper for the Stand-
ish Handicap. Of course, six furlongs
is too short a distance to allow Garrio
to be seen at his best, but the trainer’s
idea no doubt is to build him up in con-
dition for the autumn racing, now not
so far away.
Pamelus, who was unlucky not to win
at the spring meetings in Melbourne,
figures among the Standish Handicap
aspirants. His owner-trainer never is
communicative concerning plans for the
future. Pamelus may not be ready for
real action just now, but shrewd turf
followers in Melbourne reckon that the
Caulfield Futurity Stakes in February
will be almost a soft snap for this
fellow.
* * * *
Jack Holt is getting the imported stal-
lion Plymouth Sound ready for racing.
This thoroughbred went wrong in the
spring and had to be withdrawn from
many valuable engagements. He had
good form in England, and will be some-
thing to reckon with on Australian
courses if he stands a preparation.
* * * *
Silver Standard and Heroic Faith were
sent back to Sydney by express train
last Thursday, having concluded a bene-
ficial spell at Bacchus Marsh. They
were accompanied by Sylvandale, whose
racing days are over, and who is to be
retired to the stud. It had been ex-
pected that he would be leased to a
noted Victorian breeder, but apparently
plans in that direction fell through.
* * * *
The V.R.C. has done much for retired
jockeys who needed assistance in later
life. It also finds employment for
former knights of the pigskin. On the
ground staff at Flemington is Peter Cos-
grove, who won a Grand National
Hurdle and Australian Hurdle on Mar-
mont, besides capturing the Australian
Hurdle on The Wizard, an Adelaide-
owned gelding. Cosgrove became a
trainer, but did not have a great deal
of luck in that capacity. One of his
companions in employment at the head-
é
South Australians
for 181 (Hynes 4
for 35 and White 3
for 23). But for
Ryan (33), Whiting-
ton (57) and the
newcomer Schultz
(30) it would have
been much less, al-
though there was
nothing very dan-
gerous about the
bowling. At stumps
Mudge and Marks
were out for 43.
* * *
While the Austra-
lian attack in Syd-
ney was so plainly
lacking in devil,
Fleetwood-Smith, in
his first representa-
tive game since the
operation to his
finger, was going
through the Queens-
land Shield team in
Melbourne. The
wicket was slow
and heavy, and
Ebeling sent the

He got the first
wicket, then the
slow left-hander
chased them back
to the pavilion for

Betting systems? There isn’t one that’s
worth a row of pins.
Backing favorites, backing second
favorites, laying out so much to win
10s., £l, £2 a day, by doubling the wager
when you lose —these and other alleged
systems are nothing but short cuts to the
Bankruptcy Court.
Perhaps the notion of beginning with
£1 and putting on £2 when the pound
has gone west and £4 when the book-
makers have got the. £2 and £8 when
the bag has closed on the £4 —there are
different names for it —is the most
idiotic of all. Underlying it is the fond
belief that you must spot a winner sooner
or later, and that when you do you get
all your losses back and gather in what
you have set out to win for the day. But
suppose your winner starts at odds on
and you have had such a bad “trot” that
there isn’t enough left in the bank for
recovery of even half your losses; or
suppose, the bookmakers won’t accom-
modate you with the necessary wagers.
Either thing is apt to happen ; and then,
of course, odds-on chances are beaten.
In a candid moment an old bookmaker
gave some shrewd advice to a punter-
friend. “If you’re doing pretty well,” he
said, “give your winnings a fly; but
always play light when you’re losing.”
The defect of the particular system
outlined is that you can’t play light when
you’re losing. If the Commonwealth
Bank were behind a man following it,
he might possibly show a profit at the. end
of the year, but the profit would be
miserably small in proportion to the out-
lay. And trading banks don’t finance be-
lievers in betting systems. No trading
bank will finance a punter at all if it
knows he is a punter, and he asks for an
advance without substantial security.
Some system cranks believe they can
beat the books by supporting newspaper
tips. They buy seven or eight newspapers
on Saturday, and in each race back the
horses tipped by the majority, applying
the double-up “principle.” The. writer
knows a man who has tried it twice.
He swears he would have won a heap
of money on each occasion if the bank
hadn’t given out. The trouble with these
devices for getting rich quick is that the
bank always gives out.
Asa rule, sporting reporters are fairly
good judges, but they have the defects
of their qualities. Form is their guide,
and it is not always a safe guide ; and
they rarely select outsiders. So if the
object is the winning of a certain speci-
fied sum each day, following newspaper
tips means a very substantial outlay week
in and week out.
Now and again the specified sum might
be won on the first race, but seeing the
rest of the programme without backing
anything would be a strain which few
system punters could endure. In any
case, expenses are heavy.
If the writer ever seriously tried to
make a living at punting, he would dis-
card from his calculations two-year-old
races, maiden plates, novice handicaps
and the like, and reserve his wagering for
“classics,” w.f.a. races and handicaps “for
three-year-olds and upwards” with some
pretensions to quality. Then he would
make a list of animals which in their
particular divisions rarely run badly—
finish well up nearly every time. Such
horses may be written down as honest
and game, and capable of triumphing
over difficulties; in a word, good horses.
Going, jockey and —in the case of six-
and seven-furlong races —position at the
barrier would also bq considered ; like-
wise the betting.
Having decided on his fancy, he would
back it both ways. If two horses on his
list met in the same race and if he had
no great preference for one over the
other and if both could be backed to
show a profit on either, he would back
both. And, in all his operations he
would be content with modest profits and
abandon as utterly hopeless the thought
of making a pile by plunging on any
particular horse or group of horses.
Wherever it can be done, it is always
wise to cover a straightout wager on the
place tote. Backing “for a place” is
really the most pleasurable form of
wagering. You can’t lose much on the
place tote, and it is possible to win more
on it than by sticking to s.o. betting. All-
up wagering on the ss. or 10s. tote can
turn a man in a tidy profit if he is shrewd
and doesn’t try to pick the card.
Unfortunately Governments restrict
the popularity of this mildest and least
dangerous form of betting by demanding
too much from the pool. The N.S.W.
Government takes 9 p.c., which is no-
thing but rank extortion. It is exceed-
ingly stupid, too ; for it means that the
Government gets less revenue than it
would receive if it were content' with a
modest cut. Tts greed is the means of
driving thousands of people to illegal
“I thought you said
'Give him one on
the lug '!”
starting-price bookmakers, with results
on which a Judge has remarked.
When there are six to eight starters in
a race, the tote pays 50 p.c. each first
and second, less what is deducted for
Government, club and tote co. This
is not always realised by people at Rand-
wick, partly because other Sydney clubs
stick to the unsatisfactory 60-20-20 dis-
tribution, and many a chance of getting
quite a decent dividend on a second
horse is thrown away.
Another thing not realised by all
visitors to Randwick is that the “new”
tote-board fails to indicate the position
when a hot favorite will return worse
odds for a win than for a place. People
who have spotted this peculiarity of the
machine have had the laugh on friends
who have backed their fancy on the
straightout tote or laid odds on him in
the ring. In the Chelmsford Stakes,
Gold Rod returned 15s. for 10s. on the
straightout machine and precisely the
same for a place. Similar instances have
happened before and will happen again
no doubt.
This is not written in a spirit of criti-
cism of the Randwick tote. It is a very
fine development of the mechanical
talent of Australians ; and when the Gov-
ernment gets a bit of sense and reduces
its tax from 9 p.c. of the pool to 4 p.c.
—making reduction conditional on the
retention of fractions of threepences only,
instead of fractions of sixpences—tote
punting will be far more popular than it
is. Then the crowds will come back from
the starting-price dens, the Government
will get more revenue from its ticket tax
—although that also should be greatly
reduced—and clubs will be in a position
to increase prize-money.
Westralia is now the one State in
which publication of ante-post odds is
permitted. Before the recent s.p. legis-
lation was passed, Queensland papers
gave the betting on events like the Mel-
bourne and Sydney Cups, the Epsom and
the Metrop., the Newmarket and the Aus-
tralian Cups, and it was some, sort of a
check on bookmakers’ rapacity. Now
ante-post quotations appear in Westra-
lian papers only, and they arrive in
eastern States capitals too late to be of
any service to backers. The campaign
against s.p. betting is warranted, but it
could be carried out without this odds
embargo, which in the States which have
had it for years has never been of the
slightest service—except to bookmakers.

“Moreton”: Racing is booming in
Brisbane since the passing of the new
Act. All the clubs report increased
attendances, totalisator returns and book-
makers’ fees. Punters are now to get
their turn. Threepence—yes, threepence
—has been taken olf the charge for ad-
mission to the Q.T.C. Leger, making it
2s. 6d., and there is to be a two-bob
tote.

Young* Crusader is to have another
jockey in the Summer Cup—W. Cook,

the general belief that the Metrop. win-

judgment in the Melbourne Cup.

J. T. Jamieson’s success with his team
since he returned to the turf after his
enforced retirement has delighted his
friends, especially the M.L. section. All
his winners have been Maoriland-bred.
He saddled up a couple more at Rose-
bery on Wednesday—his own filly Bertha
B, by Wotan’s sire Siegfred out of Gay
Salute, and Latharna, the four-year-old
brother to Limyris, by Limond-Pomyris:
he is owned by Major Kerr-Smiley. To
judge by the betting—lo to 1 Bdrtha B
for a division of the Maiden Handicap
and eights and tens Latharna —neither
was fancied by the stable, but it is
alleged, though it seems improbable con-
sidering the prices, that starting-price
bookmakers suffered.
Latharna’s two previous runs in Syd-
ney this season by no means suggested
an early victory for him, but after all
he beat a poor lot. The race was an
Encourage Stakes. He should defeat
better fields when seasoned. It should
not be forgotten that he was backed
down to 9 to 2 for the Chelmsford
Stakes, w.f.a., at Randwick last year, and
came fourth to Sylvandale, Contact and
Rogilla, who was favorite. Not a close
fourth certainly, but among the horses
who finished behind him was Silver
Standard, since second in the Metrop.,
Caulfield Cup and Melbourne Cup.
Reckoned in and out, only a few weeks
ago, Falstaff has suddenly stamped him-
self as the most consistent sprinter in
Sydney. He has had successes in his last
three starts —two at Warwick Farm, the
other at Ascot—and each has been gained
comfortably. On the 'first' two occa-
sions he. was an outsider. At
Rosebery on Wednesday he was
favorite at 2 to 1, Turbine being
at fours. The old stallion is some-
thing of a champion on ex-pony
courses, but he had no hope with
Falstaff. The latter is by Tippler-
No Belle, an alliance that has pro-
duced other good winners.
M.Q. and Rafferty
The N.S.W. Workers’ Compensation
Commission is still struggling with the
case in which a former N.S.W. pugilist
is suing a showman on the ground that
he became punch-drunk in the show-
man’s service. N.S.W. law is such that
meticulous proof is required. Claimant’s
counsel —himself, they say, no mean hand
with the gloves—stated that many poor
devils have had to apply for the in-
valid pension because they were knocked
silly while fighting for rich promoters,
and described the disgraceful business
as “a racket.” He should have included
free-pass politicians in his censure. The
pitiful brotherhood of the punch-drunk
appeals to humanity from them.

The Braddock-Louis match is off,
Braddock having agreed to meet Schmel-
ing, who objects to the champion taking
a risk with the black before engag-
ing in a championship fight. A very
reasonable objection, for a beaten cham-
pion, even if the title were not involved,
would be no gate-money attraction.
Meanwhile Louis continues to whip
second-raters. One Simms, totally un-
known in these parts, he disposed of in
13 seconds: virtually a one-punch fight.
One-punch fights used to be fairly com-
mon in ruder days, when pugs were
wholly pugs and not half-actors. Bill
Doherty, of Fremantle, was the hero of
one which was chronicled in the record-
books for many years.
Ins and Outs
The Englishmen’s match at Ipswich
(Q.) brought its own bit of bother.
First, the attendance was below expecta-
tions: the first day 1500 went in through
the turnstiles and half as many again
through a hole in the fence; on the
second day there weren’t so many
through the turnstiles, but more through
the hole. Still the £l5O guarantee was

Th e Tyres with the Longest Non-Skid Life
collected, plus about £4O, and that blew
over. Then Robins, in the countrymen’s
second innings, decided to rest Voce and
sent Wade (the twelfth) out as ’keeper.
The country skipper, one of his bats-
men having been hurt, asked permission
to bat his twelfth, and got away with it.
That wasn’t so easily passed over. The
Board of Control is to have a look at
the affair, having been heavily critical
of a similar incident in 1932-33, when
Larwood, who was twelfth, bowled at
Bendigo. To cap it all the Ipswich ants,
bulldogs “as big as canaries,” kept the
visitors busy.
Thanks to some big hitting by Ham-
mond, chiefly, the Englishmen came
close to beating the countrymen, in spite
of their 300 first-innings score. Fagg
(46) and Worthington (72) got to 87
before they were parted, and then Haim
mond put on 50 in 24 minutes and 109
in 50 minutes, nine sixes and 10 fours
among the runs. Later Voce (39) hit
five sixes in one over, and six all told.
The team’s 406 went on the board in
242 minutes. The countrymen lost their
first at 52, and with Copson (three for
16) takin’ ’em had four down for the
same figure. Then Ames got three for
12, and Hardstaff two for 23. It was all
out 124.

“Verax”: There is plenty of ground
for criticism of Brisbane’s cricket arena
(B. 16/12/’36). The playing area is
good enough, but the accommodation
for the public, especially outside the re-
served stands, is abominable, the equi-
valent of Sydney’s Hill being a redhot
dustheap. Sanitary arrangements are
as primitive as when writer played on
the ground 40 years ago, and the prin-
cipal outfit can be reached only by fight-
ing one’s way through an always-con-
gested bar. The Q.C.A. should also do
something about the dressing-rooms,
which likewise date back to the happy-
go-lucky days of last century. It seems
to take in enough money to do some-
thing more worth while than the impor-
tation of cricketers with southern repu-
tations who block the progress of native-
born talent.

inviting secretary Harold Heydon of the

be managed by Liddicutt, a very good

from N.S.W. ; Peggy Antonio, a very
clever bowler—slow leg- or off-spinners
—heads four Victorians; and there is
one from each of the other mainland
States. Barbara Peden, at present in
England, wants to whack in her £75, and
will likely be added as a sixteenth player.

“Aigburth”: “Bobby” Abel’s death in
England at 80 removes about the last of
the old school of cricket professionals
who much preferred staying apart from
amateurs on tour, using different dress-
ing-rooms and going on and off the field
by their own special gate. He was of
the school of Briggs, Peel, Tom Emmett,
George Ulyett and many another rough
diamond. Abel, played for Surrey from
1881 to 1904, making his 2000 year after
year. Players like Hayward, Lockwood,
Richardson and W. W. Read came and
went while he remained unconquer-
able. A frail-looking, round-shouldered,
shambling little, man, he was about the
last on whom a stranger would pick as
a great cricketer.
Nineteenth Hole
“Divot Digger”: Queensland’s Von
Nida put it all over Jim Ferrier in their
exhibition match for charity at the Lakes
(N.S.W.) club, winning four and two.
Von Nida made few mistakes and Fer-
rier many, the professional handling the
gusty conditions more capably than his
rival.
* * *
“Hamilton”: This year’s Queensland
caddies’ contest for the “Courier” Cup
was won by an unusual variety of the
breed. Sixteen years old and six feet
tall, Bernard O’Sullivan is at school
during the week at the Christian Brothers
—on Gregory-terrace, overlooking the
course of the Victoria Park club ; on
this he caddies, getting what practice he
can at week-ends. His card was 76, four
better than the runner-up.
* * * *
“Brassey”: When the N.S.W. golf
heads some time ago introduced a State-
wide system of par handicapping, they
failed to realise the inertia and indiffer-
ence of the players they were out to
help. The root of the system is the sub-
mission by all players regularly to the
handicapper of cards showing scores.
Without this the handicapper cannot act
and the scheme is rendered useless. It
has been found that a majority of the
clubs, especially those rated as A grade,
have ignored the handing in of members’
cards. In the Sydney area only three
have done so regularly: Moore Park,
Manly and Ryde-Parramatta. When the
scheme was inaugurated the clubs were
asked to impose penalties for omitting
to turn in cards, but only the three
named have done so. Manly cuts the
handicap of a defaulter by a third,
Moore Park bangs offenders down to
scratch.
* * * *
“Stockton”: Harry Sinclair, who once
held the amateur championships of
N.S.W. and Australia and the Queens-
land amateur and open titles, has left
Sydney for a job in Newcastle. He will
be an acquisition to Newcastle golf.
* * * *
“Coif”: Following on an English
judgment, a Sydney woman has obtained
damages for nuisance against the pro-
prietor of the Northcote golf links,
Chullora (N.S.W.). Plaintiff was driving
a car on a road alongside the links when
a ball driven by a player went through
her windscreen and she was cut by
broken glass. In this case, as in the
English one, the club and not the player
who had struck the ball which caused
the damage was held liable. The presid-
ing Wig thought it worth £3O to the in-
jured lady.
* * * *
“Hoylake”: A Japanese journalist who
had never seen golf before reported the
last Walker Cup match between America
and Britain, and without knowing it put
his finger on the reason why the Britons
have not won a match since the series
began. A translation of his article says
that the idea of the game is to get the
ball as near the hole as possible with-
out dropping it in. He is filled with ad-
miration at the way the British outdid
their rivals at this difficult feat, whereas
the Americans were unable to prevent
their pills going down the mine. An
acuter criticism —though quite an unwit-
ting one —of the vile putting which is
admittedly the great handicap of British
golfers can hardly be imagined.
..Racquet and Bawl
Bromwich kept his Sydney form in
the Victorian championships and looked
like getting through to the final, but
Turnbull, keeping them high and lob-
bing ’em—he must have been about the
first to try that game against the young-
ster —put him out in the quarter-finals
without much trouble: 6-2, 6-1, 8-6.
Quist got through that far easily enough,
but the other two, the Victorians Hop-
man and Kay, had close calls. Kay
dropped the first two sets to Thompson,
and a comparative newcomer in J. E.
Harper led Hopman two sets to one and
was ahead 5-2 in the fifth.
The two South Australians got
through to the final. Queenslander Mrs.
Westmacott caused a bit of a boilover
by accounting for Miss Wynne in the
women’s semi-final.
Miscellaneous
“Stand Off”: D. A. Campbell, The
King’s School (N.S.W.) forward, who
distinguished himself in the Oxford-
Cambridge match at Twickenham, has
been selected to represent Scotland in the
international trials. The “Daily Tele-
graph” says that the selection, together
with that of a couple of South African
backs, makes the representative character
of the team ridiculous. As, however,
there are generally three trials, the ob-
jectionable “colonial” element may be
weeded out.

communiques about the Springboks' visit.

RHEUMATISM-
BACKACHE-Sciatica-
THE DANGER SIGNS OF DIRE KIDNEY AND URIC-
ACID TROUBLE.
REMEDY THAT SUCCEEDS WHERE ALL ELSE FAILS.
That aching stiffness —those bad swellings in joints and muscles —that nerve-racking pain,
burning agony and dizziness —mean Kidney Trouble. The vital organs cannot cope with
their load. Uric-acid Poisons and sharp crystals collect in joints, muscles and nerves.
Neglect always means pain, seriously lowered health and vitality—a sequence of maladies
often endangering life itself.
WHY HARRISON’S PILLS Give SUPERIOR RESULTS
It is easy to lull the pain of Rheumatism and other bodily tortures. Aspirin, and many
simple pills, will do this. But it is temporary—the cause of the trouble remains, and the
pain frequently returns.
Harrison’s Pills work on different lines. First, they cleanse and soothe the kidneys and
urinary tract effectively. This alone gives immediate and exceptionally beneficial relief.
Next, they lastingly strengthen the kidney-action. Then, they dissolve the uric-acid crystals
and deposits that lie along and torture the joints, nerves and muscles. Finally, they eliminate
the danger-elements from the system. Other remedies do not provide the same guaranteed
action and thorough security as Harrison’s Pills. No other gives such a quick, safe, logical
and completely assured clearing of all aspects of the trouble in so short a time.

will be met at Sydney on June 19, and
then the side goes to Queensland after
a couple of N.S.W. country games. Two
Tests are down for Sydney on July 10
and 17, but if possible an extra one is to
be wangled for Brisbane. Unofficial
games will be played at Perth and Adel-
aide, but the request of the Westralians
that half a dozen Eastern players be
sent over to stage a sort of “All Aus-
tralia” match has been turned down.

“Fitzcray”: The new King’s birthday
will hit Melbourne football hard, as
well as that in Sydney. The V.F.L. has
been able to rely in the past on at least
£3OOO in revenue on that date, the prin-
cipal game returning anything up to
£l5OO. The League fixtures committee
is getting busy on the matter already,
and a revision of the yearly programme
will be made to fit in with the altered
circumstances.
* * * *
“Marija”: Baseball should get a kick
along in Sydney next month. The U.S.
mercantile marine training-ship Cali-
fornia State is to cast up there on the
18th, and five games have been arranged
for the following week —one against
the combined City Houses team, and
another against the pick of the Summer
League players. The game has been
taking on well in the Harbor City during
the last couple of years, and the locals
are anxious to beat the seamen, rated a
pretty good lot.

“Spike”: Several Dunn Shield records
toppled at Sydney Sports Ground. Len
Graham heaved the 161 b. hammer 142 ft.
2|in., beating by 2ft. 4in. figures which
had stood for 22 years, a useful toss,
though short of the Australian record. A
new pole-vault figure was set by W.
Cartwright, who cleared 12ft. beat-
ing Nick Winter’s figures by an inch and
a half. J. Metcalfe, Empire champion
and record-holder, was outed in the hop,
step by Basil Dickinson who covered
49ft. Hin.

“Shinty”: According to the Austra-
lian women hockey-players, returned
from the international tourney in Phila-
delphia, Australia will be snowed under
by visiting women’s teams in 1938,
among them a side from Canada and
another from England. The latter will
visit Australia first' and, after playing
here, go on to M.L. The Canadians will
come by way of Maoriland. It is likely,
too, that an All-British team will be here
next year for the All-Australia tourney
in Brisbane. English, Scottish, Irish and
Welsh delegates at Philadelphia were en-
thusiastic over the idea.
* * * *
“Duckwing”: Some months ago writer
recorded the departure for Tahiti of two
of Australia’s primest fighting cocks.
Now advices have been received that the
birds have cleaned up all the local pro-
duct in sight, and that nine more have
been ordered from the Sydney Fancy for
shipment by the first steamer. Cock-
fighting affords a curious instance of
how little respectable citizens think of a
law which is not backed by public
opinion. Banned like s.p. betting, cock-
fighting nevertheless flourishes in Syd-
ney and is specially catered for by a
small coterie of breeders. There is much
to be said for the sport. The birds them-
selves live only for fight, and the betting
is no more harmful than that which ac-
companies coursing or pigeon-shooting.
No cock ever sells a fight, and if his
owner tries to do it for him detection is
easy and the consequences painful, since
to-day mains are generally fought in re-
mote and lonely places.

“Splash”: The smouldering animosity
of golfers (B. 16/12/’36) is as nothing
to the open enmity existing between
surfers. The selection of 24 candidates
for a surfing team which is to tour
Maoriland in January has set the Sydney
beaches in a rage, some famous clubs
having been practically ignored in the
selection while others, regarded by their
rivals as duds, have three or four men
in. It is satisfactory to note that seven
country swimmers have been included
in the 24, which number, however, is to
be finally reduced to eight. Six are from
Newcastle; the other is Fitzgerald, of
Corrimal, who is Australian belt cham-
pion.
* * * *
“Six-beat”: A fine N.S.W. swimmer,
Sam Herford, has gone over to the pro-
fessional ranks, where he will concen-
trate on coaching. Winner of several
Australian and N.S.W. championships—
including the Australian surfing cham-
pionship in 1932-33 —Herford was un-
fortunate in being a contemporary of
Noel Ryan, who was a bit better. Her-
ford swam 30 seconds to> Ryan in cham-
pionship events, and has now thought
it a fair thing to get out of the racing
side of the sport, which is apt to grow
monotonous in such circumstances.

“Blade”: Mosman won the N.S.W.
champion fours on the Nepean for the
twelfth time. The crew was made up of
three King s Cup oarsmen and White
who last year stroked the victorious
Mosman lightweight four, his double
being a record for the event, Previ-
ously, Sydney had tied with Mosman
with 11 wins, so this victory puts the
North Shore club one ahead. It was
divulged at the regatta that the local
authorities are to build a drive along the
river bank from s , , flnish f the
. „ ...
ourse. This will give any
number of spectators a perfect and com-
fortable view of the race, and it ia to be
finished for the G.P.S. regatta in April.

MANAGING EDITOR, Spencer Tracy
HIS OFT-DEFERRED BRIDE,
Jean Harlow
PROFESSIONAL LADY-KILLER,
William Powell
HIS INTENDED VICTIM, Myrna Loy
HER FATHER .... Walter Connolly
The material of this delectable comedy
won’t stand much after-analysis, but the
thing moves so swiftly and smoothly
and assays so many chuckles to the
minute that to examine its teeth would
be ungracious. A New York journal
has published an indefensible slander
about an immensely rich society girl.
She claims five million dollars damages.
As a counter blow the managing editor
hires a specialist in that sort of business
(W. Powell) to compromise the lady, and
so that a home-wrecking charge will
stick marries his agent off to his own
girl (J. Harlow). It is a marriage of
convenience, easily to be annulled at
Reno when the job is over.
But the rich young lady is a wary
bird, and to get into her society the per-
fidious Powell has to convince her father
that he is an accomplished fly-fisher of
trout. He takes lessons in casting and
reads every available book on the sub-
ject. He is seen, even while shaving,
digging chunks of information out of a
pile of tomes and rehearsing such sen-
tences as: “but, of course, for the very
best sport you must go to Lake Tow-
hoopoo in New Zealand.” But he’s no
half-wit, and puts up a very fair bluff of
being an accomplished fisherman when
put to the test'.
The strength of the fun-making lies in
the fact that all the characters, in their

ness,’’ at Sydney Lyceum.
respective, ways, are clever and sophisti-
cated, and, as is gently insinuated to-
wards the end, as good-hearted as any
of us. The play ends with climax, anti-
climax and finally a return to the terms
of the first climax, which leaves every-
body happy.
Each of the five actors has a con-
genial role and gets the last ounce out
of it. Every point is made with neat
precision. Among the little jests is a
shrewd poke towards this quarter of the
compass. There is a hue and cry for
Powell. He may be in London, Singa-
pore, Tokyo. “Try Sydney,” suggests
someone, “he always was fond of
the races.” Previewed at M.-G.-M.

“Poor Little Rich Girl.”
INFANT PRODIGY .. Shirley Temple
DOTING PAPA .... Michael Whalen
HOOFERS .. Alice Faye and Jack Haley
CRUSTY CURMUDGEON,
Claude Gillingwater
In this fantasia Shirley is the daughter
of a young and beautiful millionaire shoe
manufacturer, a widower (but not for
long). She has six ponies, 300 frocks,
150 pairs of shoes, a whole warehouse-
ful of toys. A nurse, a butler, a house-
keeper and a huge staff of servants hover
round her. If she sneezes she is sent
to bed and medical specialists are called
in at panic-speed. She has no playmates
but her dollies, and inside three minutes
she is singing to these a long, elaborate
ditty, accompanied by a vast symphony
orchestra, which apparently is kept on
tap in this eccentric household day and
night lest such occasions should arise.
As the dear mite’s facilities for entertain-
ing her public appear to be rather re-
stricted in this environment she is sud-
denly stranded friendless in a strange
city, where she demonstrates her versa-
tility by giving a false name and getting
herself adopted by a songandance couple.
Her education having included long
training in tap-dancing she is, of course,
a tremendous acquisition to the team,
which goes in for radio entertaining, and
thereafter in various charming changes
of costume Miss Temple goes through
evolutions which seem more suited to
the vaudeville stage than the broadcast-
ing studio where they occur. Exerting
her charm on the bad-tempered old
blighter who is her pa’s stoutest com-
petitor in the shoe-manufacturing arena,
she gets a contract for herself and asso-
ciates to advertise his wares, and thus
papa hears her over the radio and rushes
round to the studio to reclaim his lost
darling. But though the child is thus
restored to the paternal bosom there is
such a thing as sanctity of contracts, and
the proceedings fade out with the infant
in military regalia still doing her best
for the shoe industry before the micro-
phone.
Piffling stuff, but it is what Miss
Temple’s many admirers pay to see and
hear. And after all, she’s one of the
wonders of the twentieth century. At
Sydney Regent.
“Without Orders.”
AIR-PILOT Robert Armstrong
HIS GOIL . Sally Ellers
HER FLIGHTY SISTER, Frances Saye
AIR-LINE OWNER, Charley Grapewin
The twentieth century has given melo-
drama a fresh lease of life by producing
a new harrowing situation —’plane lost in
a fog over mountains, petrol running
low ; to stay up is impossible, to come
down is to crash. There are various
ways of working a happy ending, and
this opus produces a new one. Cowardly
pilot has bailed out; goil (’plane hostess)
takes his place at controls. On the
ground a thousand miles away her pilot-
lover instructs her by radio. He ar-
ranges an impromptu landing ground
well lit by flares, gives her compass and
altitude bearings, and, when the engines
cough and splutter and go dead, she
volplanes down to it and pancakes to a
safe landing. Afternoon audience at
Sydney Regent cheered wildly, and why
shouldn’t it?
The affair is well staged, flying
sequences being particularly well done,
Armstrong does the strong, silent man
stuff effectively and the goils are
sprightly. Old Charley Grapewin,
though he has made a dizzy social climb
and is a millionaire captain of industry,
is as human as ever. A good thriller.
“Swing Time.”
HOOFERS,
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers
DEVOTED TO ABOVE,
Helen Broderick and Victor Moore
Astaire is without peer as a tap-dancer,
and his acting is improving ; Miss Rogers
is his ideal dancing partner and she
has amply demonstrated her ability as a
comedienne. In “Roberta” the pair
shone brightly; in “Top Hat” they
twinkled intermittently; in this latest
vehicle, which is merely a collection of
songandance numbers tethered together
by a worn-out piece of string, they are
liable to cause yawns to grow on people
over the mental age of six.
Miss Rogers is instructor in a dance
academy. Mr. Astaire, smitten by her
charms, goes there for instruction. What
a laff! The great Fred Astaire going to
learn dancing! Unfortunately that’s
about the only laff on tap. Astaire and
Rogers speedily become night-club stars.

Vict o r Moore,
a slow - spoken

to, have a depres-
sing effect on
Miss Broderick,
whose wisecracks
lack the breezy
vigor they need
to carry them over.
However, as previously remarked,
there’s plenty of gay hoofery and doleful
croonery. The opus is to be a headliner
at Sydney State.
“One-way Ticket.”
BIG HOUSE GUEST .. Lloyd Nolan
PRISON GUARD CAPTAIN,
Walter Connolly
HIS WILFUL DARTER, Peggy Conklin
An unlikely story has been made
almost credible by deft direction and
spirited acting.
It is difficult to believe that a shrewd-
looking young man would be such a nit-
wit' as to burgle a bank already closed
through the peculations of its president
and take only the exact amount to the
cent shown as the balance in his pass-
book, thereby giving the demons a
water-tight clue. But he does so, thus
allowing the film to proceed. Prison
guard’s daughter looks upon the young
malefactor kindly. Later she connives
at his escape in her trunk when she
returns to college ; they marry and bolt.
When the cordon closes and the escapee
totes a gat, threatening to shoot his way
to freedom, his wife gallantly plugs him
in a non-vital spot to save him from his
folly. Then they both go to face what’s
coming to ’em, supremely confident that
their great lurv won’t get barnacles on it
before they once more can listen to the
birds carolling.
Lloyd Nolan gives a clinking perform-
ance and skilfully scotches any tendency
to melodrama. In this he is ably abetted

by attractive Peggy Conklin. Walter

“Love Letters of a Star.”
FATHER OF STAR ... Samuel Hinds _
HER SISTER Polly Rowles
SISTER’S FIANCE .... Henry Hunter
HAMFAT Ralph Forbes
Starts in the key of melodrama. Female
film star commits suicide because per-
secuted by blackmailer. Her husband,
enraged, starts to choke blackmailer, who
falls down dead, apparently from heart-
failure. From then on the affair de-
velops into a murder thriller, and when
the actor to whom the letters were
written stops a knife in the back the
plot thickens. A snap finish unmasks
a totally unconvincing criminal.
The only one of a mediocre cast who
stands out is Samuel Hinds, who makes
a dignified paterfamilias. At Sydney
Capitol.
“The Arizona Raiders.”
GIRL RANCH-OWNER, Marsha Hunt
HER PROTECTOR .... Larry Crabbe
COMIC STOOGE .. Raymond Hatton
REAL BAD HOMBRE, Grant Withers
In this adaptation of a Zane Grey
opus no rascally saloon-keeper directs
cattle-rustling. It may easily be recog-
nised, therefore, as Mr. Grey’s other
plot.
A helpless orphan and her flapper
sister try to run a ranch. Who else
would the shifty-eyed villain be, then,
but her manager? Unmistakable, he
wears the traditional zonker. Under pre-
tence of helping her cause the. dastard
has a gang of toughs working on the
outfit, and under his direction his em-
ployer’s nags are systematically pinched.
But he and his bunch of coyotes don’t
stand a ghost of a chance when one
clean-limbed, upright hombre dedicates
himself to their extermination. Hero
hops into them, assisted by his comic
offsider. What boots it if he is out-
numbered 20 to 1? Right must prevail,
and when all the dust that the bad men
have bitten has cleared away, an ador-
ing young ranch-owner may be seen
gazing rapturously into the eyes of the
c.-1.u.h., which is as Zane invariably
ordains.
Larry Crabbe rides a horse as effi-
ciently as he cleft the. water in previous
efforts. He expends so much energy that
he hasn’t time to act. Marsha Hunt has
little to do but look goofy-eyed, and
Powell-Loy Comedy Heads Week’s List .
Towering head and shoulders above all the rest of last week’s screen
arrivals is “The Libelled Lady,’’ a very polished and amusing comedy.
Shirley Temple in “Poor Little Rich Girl” and the hoof-team Astaire
and Rogers in “Swing Time” add nothing to their respective reputations.
“Texas Rangers,” which has streaks of originality, and “Arizona Raiders,”
which has none, are a pair of westerns. The demand for thrillers is filled
by f.a.q. productions, “Love Letters of a Star” and “Without Orders.”
“Millions,” an undistinguished English comedy, and sob-stuff melodramas
“I’d Give My Life” and “One-way Ticket” are also on tap.'

“I’d Give My Life ”
STATE GOVERNOR, Sir Guy Standing
HIS MOTHER Janet Beecher
CONDEMNED YOUTH .. Tom Brown
HIS CROONING GOIL, Frances Drake
This yawn-provoker drags through a
river of tears before expiring in a welter
of blurb and blubber. It is a cast-back
to those lachrymose melodramas re-
puted to have made the ’eighties singu-
larly dismal.
A youth (“Ah! he is little more than
a babe!”) with no baptismal name--a
tragedy which caused any last-century
lad sleepless nights—drills a hole through
his wuthless old man to save the gov-
ernor’s lady from disgrace. Though con-
demned to death, the noble youth’s lips
are sealed. There is a slight variation of
the old-time stunt of dashing to the scaf-
fold with the reprieve at 5.59£ ak emma
just as the knot is being adjusted. You’ve
probably guessed it' —he’s the high-born
lady’s long-lost son. {Cheers!) It isn’t
murder any longer—just a darned good
deed. Result: orange-blossoms (youth’s
faithful night-club goil having stuck to
him), with newly-discovered mamma giv-
ing a tearful blessing. Sir Guy Standing
is woodenly patriarchal; Frances Drake
howls copiously when not crooning
basso. Tom Brown rises to histrionic
summits when, listening to Miss Drake’s
awful vocal performance, he looks as if
he is enjoying it. The one bright spot
is lanet Beecher. At Sydney Cameo.
“Millions.”
CLOVE-KING Gordon Harker
HIS RIVAL Frank Pettingell
Though the plot of this comedy of
commerce is as obviously mechanical
as a chaff-cutter and sound effects are
subject to inexplicable crescendos and
diminuendos, the two principals put so
much vim into their antagonism that
they carry the show over the top with
them. Story is about a big pot in the
City (London, if you must have these
things explained), who is engineering a

SOME FIRST NIGHTS.
“It Pays to Advertise,” first shown to
a laughing London by Ralph Lynn and
Tom Walls, was presented by the Un-
named Players at Melbourne. Garrick
under Maie Hoban’s direction. There
was a lot of delay between acts, but
when they were on the stage the amateur
cast handled the witty lines well enough
to keep the audience chuckling. Paul
Maloney played Ralph Lynn’s Rodney
Martin and Frederick McMahon was in
Tom Walls’s part as the soap-manufac-
turing father, Sir Henry Martin, who
contracts with his private secretary Mary
Grayson—played by Eunice Cooper—to
get lazy young Rodney out to work.
Rodney and Mary, soon in love, enlist
the aid of Ambrose Peale, American ad-
vertising specialist and chatterbox, and
start up as rival soap manufacturers with
no soap but lots of advertising. Plots
within the central plot give the players
plenty to do. Nancy Kellaway breezed
in as a spurious French comtesse with
designs on some Martin money, and her
quick-fire pseudo-French and lively ges-
tures were one of the highlights. Maloney
played the, fool well, and Hollins, when
he conquered an early tendency to turn
his back on the audience, was just as
good. Miss Cooper and McMahon,
occasionally a little stiff, were hardly as
convincing. Of the minor characters
Eric Broughal, as the fatuous public -
schoolboy-ish Ellery Clarke, Benjamin
Bensley as the butler, and Dorothy Coul-
son, the French maid, handled their parts
well.

In “Desire Brings Welcome,” put on
at the Australian Hall, Sydney, local
writer Kenn Brodziak has taken as cen-
tral figure a law student fired with play-
writing ambitions, and kicking over the
traces. He is staked by a middle-aged
adventuress on condition that' he becomes
her gigolo. After varied experiences he
produces an acclaimed masterpiece, only
to be murdered in his hour of triumph.
Acting mostly as raw as the subject-
matter.
CURRENT ARTBURSTS.
What the invitation to view describes
as a “Christmas Salon” is pervading the
Macquarie Galleries, Sydney. It is a
collection of pictures by a score of more
or less well-known artists, and the idea
seems to be to put temptation in the
way of buyers of seasonable gifts. Elioth
Gruner is represented by a colorful still-
life—an Oriental figurine—and a study
of trees. Attractive flower studies are
shown by Maud Sherwood and E. A.
Harvey. J. D. Moore goes unwontedly
gay in a glimpse of Sydney Harbor, all
bright blues and pinks and greens.
Robert Campbell hits the bull’s-eye with
at least one of his little canvases, “The
Pier,” which combines sincerity, grace
and facile technique. Thea Proctor has
a silk fan and a pencilled figure to her
credit, Roland Wakelin pursues his
austere path with rugged still-lifes and
unsmiling landscapes, Lloyd Rees shows
some characteristic landscapes in pencil
and Helen Stewart, for once in a way
in a serious mood, gives a clever im-
pression of Chinese porcelain. Some
Margaret Preston and Gladys Owen
woodcuts, an attractive little street scene
in water-color by Rachel Roxburgh,
Polynesian beauties by Mary Edwards
and a landscape by J. Muir Auld round
off a well-varied selection.
Lovers of etchings and drawings will
find much to please them in Victor
Cobb’s Melbourne exhibition at the
Athenaeum gallery. Among his 133
pictures are also watercolors and oils,
but, with a few notable exceptions, they
are dwarfed by the excellence of his
pencil and etching-needle. Mr. Cobb
delights in delicate studies of trees, and
catches their charm in his patient work.
Quite a few Cobb pictures will be among
Vic. Christmas presents ; his show closes
on the Eve.

The Macleod Gallery, Sydney, is, to
make a financial analogy, a sort of
reserve bank (though with an active
trading side) among the city’s proprietary
ateliers, carrying as it does all the year
round a stock of pictures representative
of almost every period and aspect of
Australian painting. It is a fluid, ever-
changing collection, but it is always ade-
quately illustrative of the principal
paths, influences and tendencies of this
country s art.
For instance, in the current collection
there are represented Julian Ashton,
doyen of Australian teachers ; Arthur
Streeton, most brilliant o£ the early ex-
ponents of the creed Tom Roberts
f c . * tt r? j
brought out o Spam; A. H. FuUwood,
who tested all creeds, Dattilo Rubbo,
who has laid down the law to two gen-
erations of portrait painters, and D.
Commons and J. Muir Auld, whose
broad impressionistic style was matured
in an age when impressionism hadn’t
begun to be popularly understood in
Australia,

Of a later vintage, but exploring simi-
lar paths, aie the works in oils of Will
Ashton, W. B. Mclnnes, Charles Wheeler,
Percy Lindsay, Sydney Long and G. V.
Mann. Of what may be claimed in a
sense as The Bulletin school of art
(since that journal was its most deter-
mined patron) are the water-colors of
B. E. Minns, Frank Mahony and
Norman Lindsay. The gallery’s collec-
P° n Lindsay s work is large and in-

there are landscapists who carry on the
Streeton tradition such as Robert John-
son, James R. Jackson and H. R. Gallop.
and others such as H. A, Hanke, who as

veloped a landscape style of his own;
Ragless, who puts the shimmering

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Tn their wardrobe’s equivalent of white
samite the Country Women’s Association
greeted Mrs. Alfred Watt, who is a sort
of unofficial Queen’s Messenger. The
lady, whose glance under her well-de-
fined eyebrows is penetrating though
peaceful, is president of the Associated
Country Women of the World and
founder of the Women’s Institutes in
England. She is to C.W.A. circles what
Baden-Powell is to the Scouts. Maori-
land has already met her, and now she
is in Victoria. Mrs. Watt’s mission in
life is to brighten up the lot of the
woman on the land. She has known
farms and the people on them since her
childhood in Canada. She still owns an
estate on Vancouver Island, though her
home is in England.
The C.W.A. reception in the Aus-
tralia, which shrined Mrs. Watt’s read-
ing of a message from Queen Mary,
caused quite a flutter. Mrs. Hugh
Munro, who founded Australia’s
C.W.A., and Mrs. Hubert Fairfax
looked impressed and impressive. Mrs.
Arthur James, president of the Metro-
politan group, who introduced Mrs.
Watt, followed the fashion for colored
gloves. Hers were mauve, so was her
straw hat; lavender formed her posy.
This Letter liked the bit of the message
where Queen Mary says: “I attend the
afternoons in the Women’s Institute
(English for C.W.A.) at Sandringham as
often as I can. It makes a nice place of
meeting for everybody.” The last sen-
tence sounds just as direct as Queen
Mary’s own gaze.
Mrs. Watt did honor to her royal
scroll, and wore a dress and coat of
vellum lace. Her baku hat flew a brown
ostrich feather. Mrs. Matt Sawyer,
who needs no explanatory comments,
looking handsome in black-and-white,
welcomed the overseas guest, who was
nearly eclipsed by a giant bouquet of
Christmas-bells and Christmas-bush.
Somebody also handed up a toy koala.
Mrs. Hubert Fairfax went home with
an etching tucked under her arm. lona
Ruddock, a clever student, is the artist,
and she has caught the charm of St.
Matthew’s Church at Windsor. Mrs.
Ernest White, of North Queensland, was
a speaker.
Michael Terry, a traveller with some
worthwhile Australian treks to his name,
parked his car in Sydney the other day
after a run across from Adelaide. He
told this Letter of the new novel he has
just finished called My Love Is a Willow.
That’s the prettiest title heard in many
a day. It’s a story of Australia, but the
plot is more concerned with the human
drama than with background. This
novelist is an amazingly quick worker.
His last book of 80,000 words was
written, revised and packed off to his
London publishers in seven weeks. Any-
body who wants tales of real adventure;,
can get the right savor from Mr. Terry’s
Sun on the Mulga. This tells of the
country out west of Alice Springs, and
a camel expedition that went looking
for gold.
The wife of Pierre Sicard, whose father
was the sculptor of the Archibald Foun-
tain, and who himself designed the archi-
tecture, created a mild sensation with her
clothes on her arrival in Sydney. One
wonders how many naked goddesses
and mermen are algebraically the equal
of the dressmaking bills of a lady who,
it is said, gets her frocks from Worth.
It is worth noting that grey and navy-
blue were the color-notes she struck. The
skirt of the lightweight grey suit she
wore on landing was flared.
The Bertie Kellys served champagne
cocktails for the Pierre Sicards on the
terrace of their Darling Point home last
Thursday as day was merging into night.
Half the people who went to the Italian
Consular party turned up at this also.
Mrs. Kelly flashed fine eyes above
Madonna-blue draperies. Mrs. Sicard
wore a jacket of amethyst silk over a
navy knitted frock. Her small hat was of
navy grosgrain. Ruby Adams, just back
from Paris, had an ankle-length skirt of
black satin, and wore with it a jacket of
black velvet. The John Macphillamys,
from Bathurst, were there. The Mark
Sheldons —the affair was also to say wel-
come to them and to Mr. and Mrs.
Marcus Rex, of the Federated Malay
States (she was a Sheldon) —the Baron
and Baroness de Tuyll and the Walter
Bruntons were others. Some art-lovers
were sprinkled in the groups: the Pro-
fessor Waterhouses, the John Moores,
Sydney Ure Smith, the Victor Manns,
Mrs. Tom Rolin. Consular circles were
represented. The Netherlands came in
the Elink Schuurmans, and France in the
Suzors.
There’s a happy little Christmas tree
growing and blowing in the grounds of
the Golden Fleece Kindergarten at
Chippendale. It has fulfilled its destiny,
and has been hung with toys, beribboned
with tinsel, and topped by a star. One
hundred and eight little Golden Fleecers
stood before their old friends’ magnifi-
cence while the presents were gathered,
and father and mother received the gifts
made for them by baby hands. Director
Ethel Lakeman had set this children’s
party out of doors, and an awning had
been erected for the comfort of the
visitors. Mayoress Parkes was a guest
of honor and received a blue powder-puff
and a hanky.
This is Byrl, daughter of Walter Jar-
dine, the black-and-white artist. Byrl,
too, is devoting herself to art. She
is not yet through the student stage, but
later will join her father in his commer-
cial work. Dorothy Welding picture.
Italy’s Consul-General Vita-Finzi and
his wife celebrated the birth of second
son Claudio with a great cocktail party
in their home, Chatsworth, Point Piper.
Big brother Ennio is just over 12 months
old. He was born in the Themistocles
when his parents were on their way to
Sydney. The time was set from four
to seven, but scarcely anybody arrived till
after five. As the numbers swelled, the
languages spoken increased in number.
All the Consuls came to pay their
respects. Spain, the unhappy, had been
invited in the- person of its Consul-
General, Don Pedro de Ygal. The wife
of Japan’s Consul-General Murai was
a sparkling figure in powder-blue. She
wore a tiny boat-shaped hat with scarlet
wings on the side of her smooth black
head.
Mrs. Vita-Finzi was the perfect hostess,
her wafer-slim figure sheathed in black
satin. With the frock was worn a mess
jacket of white pique. America’s Consul-
General Moffatt and his tall wife were
late arrivals. Mrs. Moffatt’s frock was
of black sheer, patterned in white, and
her hat was large and shady. Mrs. Hed-
inger’s millinery was distinctive. Her hat,
sailor in shape, was of parma-violet
stiffened taffeta. Mrs. Charlie Lloyd
Jones wore an ankle-length black satin
suit, and a small brimless black satin
toque fringed with ostrich fronds. Speaker
Dan Levy was there with his sister ; Mrs.
E. Meyer brought her niece, a graceful
figure in brown and white.
Lute Drummond brought a large white
hat and a blue frock, and Tina Benti-
voglio had yellow field-flowers on the up-
turned brim of her Tuscan straw hat.
John Lane Mullins brought daughter
Barbara, and others present were Sydney
Ure Smith, Chief Justice and Mrs.
Jordan, Mrs. John Flynn, a nice color
combination in her blue sheer and parma-
violet gloves and hat, and the blonde
Mrs. Slattery in black. In all a throng
of 160 wished the new citizen of Italy
many happy returns.
The popular Major Boyle couple have
been through a round of farewells prior
to their departure for Hobart. The
Major has been transferred, and hence-
forth their home will be in quarters at
the Anglesea Barracks. This is quite
historic ; in convict days it used to be
part of the gaol. Mrs. Boyle (whose
photograph herewith is by Raymond
Sawyer) and her husband have been
stationed in Queensland, in India and in
Sydney. The family leaves on January 20.
The Jack Armstrongs’ Christmas party
brought cars whizzing to Macleay-street
on a warm, still night of the new moon.
Half of Sydney seemed to be moving
about the reception-rooms, which were
gay with immense bowls of agapanthus
and gladioli. The hostess trailed soft
black satins, and schoolgirl niece Gwen
did good deeds for grown-ups in the
way of passing cigarettes, or ringing for
cabs. Lady Ada Moreton, a visitor from
England, came to this party ; so did the
Carruthers lady, a graceful figure in
parchment lace. The Roystone Daveys,
who had already been to two parties,
came rather late. Mrs. Davey’s prune
taffeta frock wore a handsome topaz clasp
at the waist. Her shoulder cape was an
elegant trifle of silver lame and ostrich
fronds.
A pretty English girl was Thora Byrne,
in pink chiffons that in the classic fashion
left one shoulder bare. Patricia Holt,
from the North Shore, wore her black
hair cut like a mediaeval page’s, and was
otherwise currant-red crepes. Nancy
Houston was fair slimness in pastel ton-
ing, and Mrs. Sidney Baume was dark
and vivid in a taffeta frock cut with what
the fashion books call the backward
movement. Dr. and Mrs. Crawford
Robertson helped to make the fun ; she,
as usual, was among the strikingly-
dressed. Kitty Burton was charming in
lorelei-green, Mrs. Leishman, off to spend
Christmas with Mrs. Willie Collins, of
Beaudesert, supplied the perfect profile
above black lace.
Doreen and Betty Higgins were there
with mother. Betty sang, her voice fresh
as a plashing fountain. The Kennedy
girls sparkled, and the Dales talked about
Switzerland, where they were not so long
ago at school, and Fiji, which is a more
recent bit of applied geography. Their
playwright mother had her parma-violet
lace frock girdled in cherry velvet.
Sculptor Theo Cowan, who came with
Mrs. Aumuller of Samarai, wore a frock
colored like a peach-bloom glaze.
Dame Alice Chisholm, Mrs. Jimmy
Ashton, Mrs. Hubert Fairfax and half a
dozen others, among them Mrs. Val
Osborne, raised their voices in a chant
of praise to the work of Miss S. F.
Warby. For 14 years this lady has been
State treasurer for the C.W.A. as well as
attending to the cash comings-in and
goings-out of her own Harborside
branch, and now she has handed over
the care of the petty cash, the stamp
money and the collecting of balance-
sheets from the branches, and goes off
for a 12 months’ tour of England and
Europe. The Carlton was invaded the
other afternoon by crowds of C.W.A.
members wishing her a happy journey.
Perfume, flowers, a writing-case and a
handwoven rug were among the farewell
gifts piled about her.
While the ashes are still in the balance,
women cricketers are busy about their
affairs, and have decided on the team
that will tour England. This will be the
first Australian women’s cricket team to
invade Blighty. Mrs. Ranald Peden, of
Sydney, will captain it.
The Fellowship of Australian Writers
had Santa Claus and Vance Palmer for
guests at their Christmas party. This
filled the Feminist Club with seasonable
noises, such as blowing of whistles and
squeakers. Jazz caps were on every
head, and dancing was the principal
sport. Winifred Birkett received loud
applause and the gold medal of the Aus-
tralian Literature Society for her novel
Earth’s Quality. Poetess Mary Gilmore
wore a bright Spanish shawl with her
black frock. John Gould brought his
wife, who wore delphinium-blue lace.
The Kia-Ora Club, a meeting place
for Maorilanders in Sydney, will miss
Mrs. Stanley Hempton, its founder.
Mrs. Hempton sailed for her old home
town, Wellington, last week by the
Makura. Daughter Mabel, who is an
artist in flower decoration, went with her.
The two intend to take up residence
again in Wellington. One of the bright-
est parties the New Dungowan has seen
was that in Mrs. Hempton’s honor by
fellow exiles from the volcanic North
to the tussocky South of Enzed. A
crystal bowl was handed over by Maori-
land’s Trade Commissioner Taylor as
a memento of many happy lunch parties
eaten by Kia-Oraites behind the Green
Door in George-street.
Still another novelist called last week.
Lucy Heney, off to Lake Cowal for
six weeks’ complete rest in a silence
broken only by the chant of frogs, and
a few bushland noises, told of her just-
out novel The Shadow Tree. The action
of this changes from New Guinea to
Moss Vale, and around it all is an air
of quiet luxury. Lucy, accompanied by
Jean Robertson, of Hutchinson’s, has
been stirring up interest in the book
sales by a round of calls.
Wollongong seethed with excitement
last week when Virginia Lee was mar-
ried to Keith Blundell Maple-Brown, of
Gundary Plains. Virginia is the only
daughter of Dr. H. H. Lee, and is a
graduate in arts of Sydney University.
St. Michael’s blessed the vows, and
guests from city and country crowded
the pews. The bride’s frock was pic-
torial, of ivory satin very full and flow-
ing as to skirt and close-fitting as to
bodice. Blue and mauve chiffons made
the redmgote frocks worn by the three
grown-up bridesmaids. On their hair
they wore plaits of the two shades
fastened with a posy of hydrangea. The
two small attendants wore niched and
bouncy frocks of ivory satin and pretty
poke-bonnets tied with blue ribbons to
match their sashes. The reception was
at the bride’s home, which was gala
with marquees on the lawn.
To live in the beautiful Hampton
Court, whose walls have been mellowed
by time to the hue of wine, is the lot
of Mrs. H. C. Baynes, now visiting
Sydney and Maoriland. Cardinal Wolsey
built Hampton Court for his own resi-
dence, but diplomatically handed it over
to Henry VIII., who loved to pace the
terrace in view of its sunken garden, we
are told, with his “rose without a thorn,”
as he called Catherine Howard. It is in
the hothouse of Hampton Court that the
historic grape vine grows, its chief stem
almost the thickness of a tree trunk,
from which each year the King cuts the
first grapes, which then go to the London
hospitals. Against its walls grow
pleached fruit trees, and under the trees
of its park, in spring, the daffodils and
bluebells grow. It is a bus-ride from
London, and when the chestnuts are out
Londoners spend enchanted Saturdays
and Sundays there. Sydneyites of 35
years ago will remember Mrs, Baynes.
Her late husband, Captain H. C. Baynes,
was then on the naval staff. Miss
Caroline Nias is travelling with Mrs.
Baynes.

Always changing, always new. That’s why
travel in America never loses interest.
Yesterday San Francisco’s Golden Gate was
a mile-wide strait between two shores; today
in one gigantic gesture, the shores are joined.
Sharp peaks once lifting from Nevada’s desert
floor now hide beneath waters of Mead Lake
—creation of colossal Boulder Dam. Carlsbad
Caverns, Nature’s fantastic subcellars, un-
known for ages are now explored with ease.
City skylines areredesigned almost day today
It’s all so easy to see, with great railways mak-
ing time and distance obsolete. Only 75 hours
separate the coasts. Weather is unimportant
because trains are air-conditioned —which
means they make their own weather. The im-
portant things are comfort —exemplified by
modern Pullman cars for slumbrous nights,
smart club cars for daytime sociability, diners
for delicious, well-served meals—and deft
personal attentions provided by valet, maid,
barber, and others of a courteous, trained
staff; and economy —in low fares.
Equally luxurious and economical,the 18-day
South Sea cruise to California —aboard the
swift gigantic “Mariposa” or “Monterey” of
the Matson-Oceanic fleet, with their romantic
route via New Zealand, Fiji, Samoa, Hawaii.
This is the start of the Pacific-and-America
thoroughfare toEngland—the short,thrilling
way to go —devoid of obstacles and strange
languages, replete with comfort and sincere,
efficient service. Plans are unusually flexible,
and you have your choice of routes across
America, of ships across the Atlantic.
“England Across America”, our illustrated booklet,
amplifies all these interesting points, and many
more. Your request by ’phone, call, or letter will
bring it without cost or obligation.

An exhibition of Oils, Water-colors and Etchings, etc., by leading Australian artists, at the Macleod Gallery, 252 George Street, Sydney.
Admission Free. Open Week Days, 10 a.m. until 4.30 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. until noon.
Here’s a story just out from London.
It is told that the then Duchess of York
went one day to open a function, taking
with her Princess Elizabeth. The Duchess
was presented with the usual bouquet,
and the chairman stooped down to the
small girl, handing her a posy with the
remark: ‘And one for the little lady.’
Elizabeth looked at him, and said in a
firm voice: “I am a Princess!” Then
the Duchess spoke: “Yes,” her words
came over the youngster’s head, “she
was born a princess, and we’re trying to
make her a little lady.”
Sales of Christmas-trees in Sydney this
season must have been a record, for
every club and association, apart from
private merry-makings, has had its
Christmas party, and the centre of each
has been a tree of piney fronds glit-
tered o’er with fairy frost. A present
for everybody seems the slogan, and
though most of the presents are just
giddy little trifles, they are gaily prinked
out in cellophane and ribbon. If the
popularity of the tree increases with
mother and father and big sister, the
manufacturers will soon not have time
to put through the orders for the babies.
The Feminists made a diversion by
having their presents hidden in a pie,
which was the principal ornament of the
middle of the clubroom. There were 60
members exchanging the centuries-old
wishes under silver bells and glittering
balloons. President Mrs. P. A. Cameron
is the richer by a silver filigree brooch
and bracelet. Mrs. S. Whetton, a visitor
from England, received an honorary
membership as her bit of Santa Claus.
This lasts for the three months of her
visit to Australia. On the same after-
noon the women members arrived at
the Automobile Club in their smartest
raiment. With friends this rally totalled
130. Very fragile and altogether com-
mendable was Mrs. Jacobson’s Parma-
violet outfit. Mrs. Spring-Brown’s caped
frock was of flowered silk. A pretty girl
was Cicely Wheelihan. Her frock was
black, so was her small bonnet-shaped
hat. President Mrs. E. D. Findlay and
Mrs. Ken Slessor plucked the fruits from
the tree and handed out presents that
ranged from silk stockings to the last
word in novelties.
Tall and good-looking Dorothy Dunck-
ley, who has been for some time at-
tached to National Studios has gone off
to Melbourne and a return to her origi-
nal love, the stage. She is to play a
leading part in “Wild Violets,” the new
J.C.W. comedy. Dorothy played Mrs.
Teall in “Roberta,” and was the older
schoolmistress in “Autumn Crocus.” She
has acted in films, looked after publicity
and knows pretty well everything there
is to know about the making of a pic-
ture.
The (Consul-General for Denmark and
Mrs. Host will leave Sydney early in
January for a year’s vacation in their
own land. During Mr. Host’s absence
Dr. E. F. Fischer will act as Consul-
General.
Stella Scroggie in opening her Lodestar
Gallery at 77 Elizabeth-street is actuated
by the impulse to help the. less-known
artist into a prominence where the rich
buyer and collector cannot fail to be
aware of him. As well as the less-known
her intimate gallery is hung with works
by artists of renown. Nancy Goldfinch,
who shows a fresh little study of trees,
says the gallery is like the famous Walker
in London.

Melbourne
Chatter
There is the customary feverish rush
after Christmas presents. Early resolu-
tions regarding economy have been
swept aside in the avalanche, everybody
spending 10 times what they meant to
spend. And in connection with the
sending of the gifts away an interesting
little week-end sum for biologists to
work out would be the number and
classification of germs which go into
one’s mouth with a lick of a stamp. The
Elizabeth-street P.O. owns a couple of
automatic lickers, but as they are almost
inaccessible beyond cohorts of shoppers
with arms full of parcels, babies, um-
brellas and small children with balloons
being trampled underfoot, a large per-
centage of the general public prefers to
swallow its germs in comfort out of the
crush.
An intimate little party strongly salted
with literary folk gathered at the Went-
worth last week, when a plaque by Wal-
lace Anderson was presented to Miss
Kate Baker on behalf of her friends
and admirers. Though only a child when
she left her native county Waterford,
Miss Baker has not lost her soft Irish
brogue. Clasping her beautiful sheaf of
flowers, her thoughts turned back to thi
days when youthful pupils at rural
schools brought “teacher” (herself) hot,
sticky fistfuls of wild daisies.
Mrs. E. Coulson Davidson and Mrs.
Hubert Church (widow of the M.L. poet)
began a move early in the year for some
recognition of Miss Baker’s work while
she svas able to enjoy it. But Mrs. David-
son died last October while plans were
still incomplete, and her daughter Joan
finalised arrangements. Miss Baker, who
is regarded as a pioneer educationalist
and writer, made an excellent speech, in
which she referred to many literary
friends, particularly the late Joseph
Furphy, whom she first met in 1886. It
was at her suggestion that Furphy wrote
his outback memoirs which were pub-
lished by The Bulletin under the title
of Such Is Life. In 1916 she published
The Poems of Joseph Furphy, and a year
later bought from The Bulletin some
800 unbound copies of Such Is Life, and
so brought out another edition of that
fine book which had been unprocurable.
Now Jonathan Cape (London) is pub-
lishing a further edition.
Among guests at the presentation cere-
mony was Miss Baker’s sister, Mrs. M. S.
Bannister, who, in spite of her 83 years,
made a wet-windy-weather journey from
Lyonville. Miss Alice Henry and John
Shaw Neilson were there, and poet Ber-
nard O’Dowd made an apt speech as he
handed the bronze plaque to the guest of
honor.
Members of the International Club
have got used to seeing each other’s hus-
bands at evening functions; last week
they made the acquaintance of each
other’s children at a Christmas party in
the Independent Hall. The small Aus-
tralians were pop-eyed at the young
foreigners in national costume, none of
whom seemed at all embarrassed by the
interest they created. John Plogman, for
instance, was quite used to being stared
at, for he’d walked through the city in
his Norwegian peasant outfit, the only
detail of which he found distressing being
a white organdie bow-tie embroidered
with butterflies. There was nothing
very remarkable about three little Arabs
who played about with the other child-
ren and shared in the spoil of a toy
apiece. These boys, whose parents came
to Australia from Lebanon nine years
ago, are no darker than most Southern
Europeans. They speak Arabic as
fluently as English, but they have made
little progress at reading and writing the
fluid “shorthand” characters of their
own country’s print and script.
A rosy-cheeked Russian peasant lad
was Madame Trunoff’s small boy, whose
costume, except for the boots, was made
by his mother. Madame, who lived near
the Ukraine before coming to Australia,
was born in Siberia, and her complexion
is a good advertisement for that chill
country. The beautiful embroideries
upon her dress, apron and blouse are
a product of her own skill with a needle.
Daphne. Deane, impresario of the
Monte Carlo Russian Ballet Co., left
this part of the world several years ago
with some stage experience, a good busi-
ness head, a small trunk and a smaller
suitcase and very little money after
paying for a single steamer ticket. To-
day she has acquired fluent French and
an office in Paris. It is to her credit
that she can succeed at her job in spite
of her sex and retain her good humor in
dealing with temperaments which artists
—British and foreign—pretty well all
seem to possess. If all goes well Miss
Deane hopes to bring out Russian and
French opera in 1938. Broothorn photo.
Hilda Rix Nicholas (Mrs. Edgar
Wright) sent out invitations for her ex-
hibition of dolls and nursery-rhyme pic-
tures in the names of the two dolls-in-
chief, Titania and Oberon. Old Mother
Goose was present with her bird, and
Old Mother Hubbard with her dog, the
domestic pets modelled in cottonwool
solidified with paste, then cooked and
painted. Bluebeard had a gorgeous
beard of very blue wool —he must have
been terribly deep in bloodshed, for, ac-
cording to the old tale, the more wives
he polished off the, bluer his beard
became. Simple Simon and the Pieman
had adjoining stands on the silver-paper
ledge of the gallery.
Mrs. Wright had a very busy year.
Just after her Melbourne show of paint-
ings came her big Sydney exhibition.
Back at her station home she received a
commission to paint an out-of-doors pic-
ture of the daughter of some friends who
lived near by. The young equestrienne
was posed beside her horse, but the
weather was so bad for weeks that the
large canvas strapped on to a frame in
a paddock next to the artist’s garden hau
to be quickly rescued several times a day
when sudden showers of rain blew up
over the mountains. The idea of the
dolls, whose bodies are made of cotton-
wool and silk stockings, materialised as
a result of the very much appreciated
toy people Mrs. Nicholas used to make
for her son Rix before he attained the
great age and sophistication thereby of
his sixth birthday.
Dr. Inez Parer, recently returned from
abroad, is full of enthusiasm for all the
medical knowledge she has assimilated in
America and Vienna. She found that
in Rochester (Illinois) all life re-
volves round the Mayo clinic. The
wealthy brothers Mayo —one a sur-
geon, the other a physician —endowed
this wonderful clinic where diagnoses are
made before patients are directed to vari-
ous hospitals in the district. Everybody
in Rochester seems to be either a doctor
or. a patient from the Mayo. Each morn-
ing the clinic posts up the day’s schedule
of operations, so that visitors may follow
up the subjects which most interest
them.
A young gentleman was born last
month who some day should be a Chief
Justice, or at least a very learned Judge.
His name is Jeremy Darvall, and his
arrival was on the evening of the day
his mother sat for her final exam, paper
for an LL.B. She had three exams, that
week, which she did at home with a
supervisor. Similar incidents are
chronicled in the records of med. stu-
dents, but this is the first time a legal
woman has held such a brief. Pip Dar-
vall is a solicitor, and his wife before
her marriage was Barbara Weigall,
daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Gerald
Weigall.
Making her second public appearance
since she returned from abroad, Wilma
Berkeley was the very successful solo-
ist at the Liedertafel concert last week.
Miss Berkeley was born in Kanowna
(W.A.), went to school in Wagga
(N.S.W.) and studied singing as a pupil
of her aunt, Ada Berkeley Casey. When
she won a scholarship to take her abroad
13 years ago, Melba sang at her fare-
well concert and afterwards watched her
studies in London and Paris. Miss
Berkeley has had versatile experience:
she did well in grand opera (has been
alluded to as “the smallest ‘Butterfly’ in
England”), has had several successes
in light opera and has also appeared on
the dramatic stage. At a few days’
notice she took Josie Melville’s part of
Maia in “The Greek Slave.” She re-
turned to Australia on a health trip,
and in spite of the vagaries of Mel-
bourne’s climate is already feeling very
fit. Included in her programme for next
year is a concert tour of the Australian
States, to be followed by a tour of
America. Eve Ray photo.
Miss Julia Flynn is being congratulated
on her appointment as Chief Inspector
of Secondary Schools. In 1932 Miss
Flynn studied educational methods
in Europe and the U.S.A. under the
terms of a Carnegie scholarship. For
ten years she has worked as inspectot
for the Vic. Education Department, was
senior inspector for three years, and
acted as assistant-chief inspector for six
months before the appointment to that
job of J. A. Seitz, who has now been
made Director of Education. Miss
Flynn is popular with both teachers and
children, and commands respect with
educationists of both sexes for her
womanly wisdom and sane outlook.
After many years of experience she has
come to the conclusion that girls are as
worthy of educational advantages as
boys, but she is not in favor of mixed
classes.
Women who have been deserted by
their domestic staffs and are facing
Christmas in anything but the Christmas
spirit have come to the conclusion that
the “General” is an extinct species of
humanity. Domestic workers are slowly
but surely becoming specialists. The
parlormaid will not cook, the cook will
not mind the children, the nursemaid re-
fuses to run a mop over the dining-room
floor. Maids thought to be treasures by
their mistresses have “heartlessly” thrown
up their jobs so as to be free to hang
up their pillow-cases and eat their Christ-
mas plum-puddings among their friends.
The lure of extra salary is useless, for
Mary Ellen, when it comes to public
holidays, values her freedom more than
wages. Country women are having a
worse time than townsfolk, who have
more warm-weather comforts and can
always, if they want to, eat out.
Season’s greetings in Braille with long-
hand translations are being distributed
to friends of the Victorian Institute for
the Blind. These poignant messages give
pause for thought in the rush of Christ-
mas. The thanks of many sightless and
otherwise afflicted people is being offered
to charitable-minded Lord Nuffield, who
'is always helpful to deserving causes. In
1935 he gave £5OOO for the development
of the schemes for talking-books for the
blind. Now that the invention has been
proved a scientific success, he has fol-
lowed up his experimental money with
£35,000, to be paid in seven annual in-
stalments. The Carnegie United King-
dom Trustees have helped in the same
cause by giving £5OO per year for three
years for experimental research.
The talking-books are sets of records,
each side of each record playing for
about 25 minutes. One thousand
“volumes” are already in circulation
from the London Central Library for
the Blind.
Mrs. H. McL. Duigan is leaving early
in the new year for England via Singa-
pore. She is sure to have a marvellous
time, for she has poise, charm and a
sense of humor, and there seem to be
kindred spirits in every country en route
already preparing to cheer her passage.
Mrs. Duigan and Mrs. Ben Lewis are
travelling together, and are planning to
do Java overland, so that they will have
a day and night on top of a mountain
peak with the Alan Cobhams, whose
estate is reached by car along a beauti-
ful road from Bandoeng.
Mrs. Fred Salmon is leaving on Jan. 4
for her home in Jerusalem. She and
her husband, who has a civil-service
position, lead an interesting life and meet
all celebrities who visit Palestine. Their
daughter Joan is at school in England.

1 “Kaloa”: Rabaul had one more in-
stance of what education is doing for
the native when a “boy” was convicted
the other day of issuing two fraudulent
cheques, which he had signed with
European signatures. There was a simi-
lar case at Moresby a few weeks pre-
viously, and the Mandate has had several
instances of “boys” charged with false
pretences, stealing letters containing
money and other highly-civilised accom-
plishments. The latest Rabaul hero had
been trained in a mission school. He is
now receiving some more training in the
calaboose.
* * * *
“Nanango”: With a pea-rifle a youth
had a little practice on a 5000-gallon
tank which helps to supply water to the
prosperous peanut town of Kingaroy. A
black-tracker from Barambah followed
his spoor through thick scrub, down a
road to a farm and thence five miles into
Kingaroy. There the motor traffic beat
Binghi, but the police already knew
enough, and laid hands on the 19-year-
old, who—shades of Anzac snipers!
said he had fired at the tank because
somebody bet him that he couldn’t hit
it. It cost him 30s. and costs.
* * * *
“Zedo”: News of the completion of
the Port Douglas to Cooktown Highway
(B. 16/12/’36) coincided with a report
that the Ist Artillery Cadre, R.A.A., left
Brisbane to return to Sydney and camped
that night nearly 400 miles from its start-
ing point. This would be comforting if
there were plenty of mechanised artillery
units distributed over Australia, but this
is the only one. With three or four
18-inchers landed on the Cooktown-Port
Douglas stretch, plus a few mechanised
machine-gun lorries and a company ot
riflemen, there wouldn’t be an intact
town, harbor, sugarmill, butter factory,
politician or railway station north of
Innisfail by the time our pottering de-
fence organisation could do anything.
Lawrence’s performances would be no-
thing to what that lot could do. He
had to work across barren country
largely without roads, and his daily range
was an average of only about 100 miles
instead of 400 miles.
* * * *
“Zircon”: The other day a British
visitor asked a gem enthusiast in Sydney
whether it was possible to buy a decent
sapphire- alexandrite in Australia. Sydney
shops yielded stones which blushed when
they heard their prices compared with
the values of similar stones in Europe.
An application to official quarters in
Queensland produced, after several days,
a rough catalogue in pencil from a gem-
miners’ association in Central Queens-
land. Some of the stones catalogued
were already—very roughly— set. A few
more days produced the samples, five of
them ranging down from 7 carats. Of
the larger stones even the exact weights
were not known. One Was mentioned as
“approximately from six to seven carats.”
The margins in weight allowed for a
price variation of about £5. One splen-
did stone, which was worth at
least double per carat the price of the
larger stones, was offered for £5. The
stones were enclosed in hand-made enve-
lopes and sent in a tobacco-tin. Some-
body in authority in Brisbane should
begin teaching Queensland gem-miners
the rudiments of marketing.
* * * *
“Zedo”: The tradition that school-
mistresses are conservative has been shat-
tered by Hilda Greene, of the Moreton
Bay High School, Wynnum (Q.), one of
the oldest of Brisbane “ladies’ semin-
aries.” With seven weeks’ holiday ahead
of her she has left for London by an
Imperial Airways ’plane, will spend three
weeks in Britain and be back in time to
hear “Good morning, dear teacher” sung
by the fledglings of 1937. The More-
“Something brighter, Snips. It's for me uncle's funeral —the old cow
cut me off without a bob!”
ton school’s coat-of-arms has the Rock
of Gibraltar under the stars and the
motto is “Ohne Hast, ohne Rast” (with-
out haste, without rest), which the
London-Australia 14-day service might
reasonably adopt.
* * *
“Taipo”: Sydney B. Best was recently
given the plum of sugarmill manager-
ships in N.Q. —that at Tully. Best, who
was educated at Sydney Grammar,
joined the C.S.R. in 1910, and worked
on the chemical staff of its Bananaland
refineries and mills. By 1930 he was
assistant to the chief chemist at Far-
leigh mill, and a year later was appointed
chief chemist at Mossman Central mill.
In August, 1936, he was made manager
of the Tully Co-operative Sugar Milling
Association.
"Australia Jane's" Budget
Parliament House galleries were
crowded when the accession of King
George VI. was proclaimed. Our Ex-
cellency wore a white uniform, as did
two of his suite, Commander E. C.
Rhodes and Captain Reggie de M.
Leathes. Lady Wilson topped her mist-
grey gown with a wide-brimmed jade-
green straw. The Blair lady was in her
favorite shade, dark brown, and Mrs.
Forgan Smith relieved her beige-and-
brown frock with lace. Chief Justice
James Blair and the two Judges (E. A.
Douglas and Henchman) who were with
him wore something very fanciful in the
robe line —navy drapings with a delicate
lavender edging and revealing lavender
undersleeves. All the Uni. senate and
staff were present, Freda Bage wearing
cap and gown with her white lingerie
frock.
Everyone with a car, and quite a num-
ber without, rose about 5 a.m., snatched
a cup of tea and scurried off to the aero-
drome for the start of the to-Adelaide
air race. Nancy Bird, who has been
staying with the G. U. Allans, was guest
of honor at a cocktail party given by
them on the previous night. Several
other air-race entrants were there. Freda
Thompson, who took Joyce Inglis with
her, was farewelled by Mrs. C. R. Katter,
of Cloncurry, at an afternoon-tea at
Rowe’s. Ivy Pearce, the convent-trained
girl who introduced Archbishop Duhig
to air-travel, was given a send-off by her
old school friends. Little Mrs. Bonney,
Queensland’s other woman entrant, made
sure that her mascot, a string of matrix
beads, was securely fastened about her
neck before she took off.
Marmie and Kathleen Turner, off to
Sydney with their parents, who are mak-
ing the Harbor City their home, were
entertained by Jean and Helen Laing
at a farewell bridge party. Kathleen is
to be married in Sydney round about
Easter, so the hostesses added something
for the glorybox to their farewell good
wishes. Mrs. J. Laing helped daughters
to look after the guests.
Associates of Indooroopilly Golf Club
formed a guard of honor for their cham-
pion, Kathleen Dixon, when she mar-
ried Alan Morrow at St. Andrew’s Pres-
byterian Church, and the newly-weds
walked under an archway of crossed
golf sticks. Rev. Norman Millar tied
the knot, Joyce Morrow was bridesmaid
and Douglas Dixon best man. Bride-
groom is the only son of the H. C. Mor-
rows, Indooroopilly, and the bride only
daughter of the W. V. Dixons.
Our vice-regals are enjoying their
annual seaside holiday at Southport.
Archbishop and Mrs. Wand are also
spending Christmas there. Webb, J., and
Mrs. Webb have taken a house at
Surfers’ Paradise for the holidays, and
Douglas, J., and his wife and family will
go to Southport for some weeks early
in the new year.
Patricia Bell, who married Alistair
Mackinnon, of Melbourne, in St. John’s
Cathedral on December 17, got a won-
derful send-off from the family, no fewer
than 14 families of Bells being repre-
sented on the guest list. Sisters Cecil
and Elizabeth ’maided, and bridegroom’s
brother was best man. The reception
was at the Moreton Club. There were
parties right up to the minute of leaving,
E. B. Joyce, of Eidsvold, being the final-
ist in the host stakes. His effort was a
luncheon at Rowe’s. Mrs. J. M. Bell, of
Coochin, the bride’s grandmother, made
quite a lot of the pretties that went into
the glorybox.
January 16 is the date
chosen for the wedding of
Eileen McMahon, formerly
matron of the Adavale
(W.Q.) Hospital, and Alan
Wade, of Patricia Park, Ada-
vale. Eileen, who has been
holidaying at Caloundra, is
staying with her sister, Mrs.
D. F. Longland, who will be
matron of honor on the day.
The committee which looks after the
kiddies’ Christmas party arranged by
Ipswich Road Tramways Distress Fund
had a bright idea. Their Father Christ-
mas emerged from an enormous snow-
ball, to the intense delight of the small
fry. There were 300 children, and each
got a present.
From various towns and townships in
southern Queensland the hosts of the
annual Christmas dinner given by the
officers’ mess of the 2nd-14th Light
Horse Regiment converged on Brisbane.
The show was at the National, and the
table decoration was unusual—an im-
mense bowl of fruit, with tall vases oi
gladioli on each side. Brigadier J. L.
Witham, commandant Ist Military Dis-
trict, and several other military grandees
were guests of honor. Colonel Bob
Stodart, O.C. 2nd Light Horse on
Gallipoli, also was there.
At St. John’s Cathedral Dean Barrett
tied the knot for J. Dugdale, of the
Harbors and Rivers Department, to
Sylvia Jefferies, daughter of the F. C.
Jefferies couple. Capt. E. A. Thrower
was best man, and Mrs. Eric Manning
matron of honor.
Brisbane Amateur Theatre players held
their first Christmas party in National
Mutual Buildings, with the Victor
Hardgraves (the lady is better known
in theatre circles as Jean Trundle), aided
and abetted by Dorothy Harrison, as
host and hostess.

THE LITTLE SISTERS.
WESTRALIA.
Some 200 children who first opened
their eyes in Faversham Hospital re-
turned to their birthplace for the Christ-
mas party arranged by Sister Monger.
Ethel, Eileen and Norma Monger, cool
and workmanlike in their crisp white
uniforms, directed the disposal of an
endless supply of ices, assisted Father
Christmas in distributing presents from
the tree, and dispensed tea to the scores
of parents who lingered in the shade of
the gum-trees' on the lawns.
Archdeacon Parry buckled double
harness on Fred, elder son of Lieut.-
Col. and Mrs. Weick, and the F. W.
Shephards’ daughter Olive, at St. Pat-
rick’s, Mt. Lawley. The bride’s tight-
fitting bodice, square neck and lull-
from-the-waist train, the whole carried
out in rich silk taffetas, had an Edward
VIL flavor. Overhead was a filmy veil
delicately wrought with hand embroid-
eries. The blue floral silks of ’maids
Muriel Weick and Trixie Shephard clung
tightly down to the knees, where inlet
godets gave an umbrella fullness;
sashes, head-bands and sheafs of del-
phiniums were in the same deep shade
of blue.
Captain Maund and officers of the
visiting cruiser Danae were guests at a
dance held in the Naval Depot, Fre-
mantle. Commander C. C. Baldwin was
at the helm, with Lieut.-Commander
N. H. Shaw and staff officers at his
right hand. One end of the huge hall
was strewn with easy chairs, lounges
and carpets, with palms for decorations ;
the other end was for dancing. Mrs.
Baldwin matched the red in the flag and
bunting drapings with her rustling taf-
fetas, Mrs. Sweetapple slipped a tulle
coat over her black satins and Mrs.
Hammer covered her bottle-green char-
meuse with a full white tunic. Mrs.
Armstrong’s black georgettes were
flecked with cerise, a silver haze hung
over Bessie May’s violet French crepes
and there were jade furbishings to Mrs.
F. E. Gibson’s oatmeal laces.
From England comes news of Mar-
jorie Crocker’s marriage to Richard
Blount Cross, at St. James’, Spanish-
place, London. The bride’s high-necked,
full-sleeved hyacinth-blue satin finished
in a fishtail train, and her blue tulle
veil fell from a headdress of miniature
blue hyacinths. Her attendants, Eliza-
beth Kerr-Pearse, Sara Thresher' and
Angela Eastwood, were girt with cycla-
men-pink satin-backed crepe, cut on
classic lines and swooping into fishtail
trains ; their heads were bound with halo
plaits made from the material of their
frocks.
After seven years’ absence abroad,
where his engineering assignment kept
him most of the time in Russia, Arthur
Hardwicke returned to Perth with a
Russian bride. As a graduate of the
Linguist University of Moscow, the
beautiful blonde was appointed his in-
terpreter some years ago and considers
he still requires her services, describing
his Russian as “absoloo-etly babyish.”
In fluent English, liberally sprinkled with
colloquialisms caught from her husband,
she speaks of the Soviet regime, deplor-
ing the mass-production of standardised
frocks. To avoid these her own dresses
were made from the. lovely materials
which had constituted her mother’s pre-
revolution wardrobe.
In lieu of family gatherings round the
hearth at Christmas the holiday exodus
from the home is already well under
way. Judge Dwyer and his lady are off
to M.L., the Alex Williams have left
for Singapore, the Doug Braddocks will
spend the festive season in Melbourne,
Edna Smily is bound for Sydney, the
J. P, Learmonths and daughter Mollie
are packing bags for Tasmania and
Muffle Broadhurst will eat her turkey
on the high seas en route to England,
Newest recruits to the ranks of be-
trothed are Amy, younger daughter of
Rev. and Mrs. D. Dyke, of Carnamah
and the Thundelarra, and the Don
Beatons’ elder son, Donald jun.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA,
South Australians have passed through
a great week. The motor rally began ;
the air race from Brisbane was com-
pleted without accident, though not with-
out a protest; two S.A. boys reached
the final of the Victorian tennis cham-
pionship and a third led the Australian
XI. into the field against England. It’s
no use protesting that Bradman belongs
to Bowral. He’s Adelaide’s now!
The ’Varsity students revived their
procession after a lapse of several years
due to the decision of the powers that
they lacked restraint in their sense of
humor. On this latest occasion 10
floats were censored before they left the
grounds, and a flood of indignant letters
in the press suggested that even more
could have been wiped out.
Less provocative was the Uni. Foot-
lights Revue, which ran to excellent
houses for a week at the Tivoli —bright
burlesque, for which Rex Dawe, John
Duncan and Keith Macdonald were
responsible. Outstanding feature of the
show was the excellence of the dancing.
Jean Bedford had been training girl
students for six months and the result
was quite professional.
Wet weather failing to damp the en-
thusiasm of polo players and friends,
there was a good attendance at. Birk-
alla. This was assisted largely by post-
ponement of the A.R.C. meeting. Frank
Downer, Adelaide Polo Club’s captain,
entertained his Ex., Lady Dugan and
Mrs. Haselden at afternoon-tea. The
stands, which are not very spacious, were
soon overflowing, though many pre-
ferred to shelter from the rain in their
motor-cars on the opposite side of the
ground, coming across at the finish for
the cocktail party with which Mr.
Downer brought the occasion to a close.
Lay Dugan looked smart in a pale-grey
tailored suit, with, blue jumper and felt
hat to tone. Mrs. Haselden chose a
grey tailored coat with a black scarf and
hat. The host’s sister, Mrs. Otto Schom-
burg, sported a navy ensemble. Mrs.
Louis McCubbins’s black wool marocain
toilette went with mink furs.
A cheery pre-Christmas party at the
Lady Galway Hut, Henley Beach South,
was attended by Lady Dugan. In addi-
tion to the Diggers at the Hut, Matron
Eddy and Miss Marryat brought a
number of disabled men over from Kes-
wick Hospital to share in the good cheer
supplied by the Red Cross Society.
Flowers for the table had been sent down
from Mount Lofty by Miss Waite.
V.A.D.’s cooked the dinner and waited
at table. Lady Dugan made a bright
little speech when she passed on the
good wishes of his Ex. for a happy New
Year. She looked very charming in a
simple coatee frock of mist-blue crepe
worn with a wide-brimmed coarse straw
hat in the same shade, banded with
navy-blue ribbon to match her navy
silk blouse, spotted with pale blue. Miss
Roberts, who accompanied Lady Dugan,
was in a fawn-and-white striped silk
frock and a wide-brimmed beige straw
hat banded,with brown. Following the
dinner, a presentation of gifts from the
Red Cross Society was made by Lady
Dugan, Colonel Woolcock calling the
men up in turn.
The T.B. patients at Keswick Repatri
ation Hospital were also given a party.
Their’s took the form of a tea arranged
by five women of the Battalion Club Red
Cross Circle, headed by Mrs. Harold
Davies, wife of the Director of the
Elder Con.
The Adelaide Music Salon had its
pre-Christmas party at the Piccadilly.
Dance items by Phyllis and Peggy Leitch
were on the humorous side and were
cleverly executed. President C. H. A.
Lienau and his wife received the guests
An interested visitor was Frank Hardy,
a member of the Melbourne Salon. Mrs.
Lienau was gowned in a May-wine satin
beaute. Mrs. A. E. V. Richardson, who
was a guest at the presidents’ table, wore
a becoming toilette of mist-blue chiffon,
TASMANIA.
The Marquis and Marchioness of
Hartington paid the Speck a flying visit,
and in the North were shown as much
of the Island as time permitted. They
came south to Government House as the
guests of his Ex. and Lady Clark, were
entertained at an official dinner there and
tea’d at the C. W. Grants, High Peak,
after a drive up the Pinnacle-road. They
managed to put in half a day’s fishing at
the Great Lake on their way back to
catch the Taroona,
Betty Giblin started off on her visit to
her sister, Mrs. Roy Lethbridge, England,
by way of Lahore, India, where she is to
put in a gay month with the Harley
Wordsworths. Before leaving she had
a busy time, for she sat for her exams,
at Zercho's (passing brilliantly in almost
all her subjects), and was being fare-
welled at parties in every spare moment.
Among those who entertained her were
the Alan Millers, whose late-afternoon
party was extended in a small dance,
Sybil Lyons, whose party was for bridge,
Mrs. C. M. Maxwell, also a bridge
hostess, and Betty Sale and Betty Perry,
who combined in a big picture-theatre
party of Betty’s young friends.
Mrs. Riddell Stanley, hon. sec. of the
Tas. N.C.W. and of many other bodies,
is to visit England shortly. Miss Chettle
hostessed a farewell tea for her at the
Continental the other day.
Nora Scott-Power had a little surprise
for her family on their return from
abroad, in the shape of a fiance, Stuart
Harrison, of Sandy Bay.
Another recent engagement is that °f
Car, eldest girl of Mrs. Wall and the late
Rev. Leonard Wall, New Town, to R. H.
Chalmers, a scion of one of the Speck s
old families.
Ishbel, only daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
G. H. Hogg, Ausbrae, Launceston, an-
nounces her engagement to Ken, elder
son of the C. B. Davies couple, New
Town.

The Long White Cloe
Woolgrowers' Reprieve
Japanese buyers at Maoriland wool
sales are shocking Bradford with bids 60
to 75 per cent, better than last season’s
averages.
Improved conditions overseas, and
more demand for crossbred wool to
blend with other fibres in the manufac-
ture of lower-priced dress materials, un-
doubtedly promised some improvement.
A wet Maoriland spring kept early-
shorn clips light in grease and fairly free
from seed; even Bradford bids more
for this wool.
But Auckland’s £2O a bale, maintained
at subsequent sales, and increased to
£25 a bale at Christchurch, was a direct
result of spirited Japanese competition,
and the same buyers are still setting the
pace. Excluded by inane politics
from this season’s Australian sales, they
are showing Canberra what their custom
can mean —to Maoriland’s benefit.
It will do more than discomfort Can-
berra. Maoriland Labor cannot add
wool to its list of guaranteed “primary-
produce” prices while open-market
“gambles” return growers such divi-
dends.
“D.N.”: The ready support for main
trunk air services in Maoriland (B.
16/12/’36) is resulting in the establish-
ment of feeder services. First-class mail
between Gisborne and Napier is soon
to be carried by East Coast Airways.
Incidentally, it was from Gisborne that a
’plane made several trips with some of
the first outside doctors and nurses to
reach Napier and Hastings after the 1931
earthquake. Although big money was
offered for seats in available machines
by Gisborne people anxious for the safety
of relatives in the affected districts,
medical officers and supplies were given
preference until a coastal steamer left
for the south.
* * * *
“Kohi”: Minister Semple has still to
prove that he can “deal with slackers”
(B. 16 /12/’36), but Maoriland Labor
has made its position quite clear to the
Communists who asked for “affiliation.”
It said it intended gaining its ends
by “constitutional methods.” Minister
Semple had another crack at the
Communists: he said the Government
would not tolerate their “obstructive
tactics.” “Russians adopting similar
tactics against Stalin would lose not only
their jobs but their lives,” he added.
* * * *
“Fergus”: There would have been
some horse-sense in his statement that
there was scope for horse-breeding (B.
9/12/’36) if Minister of Internal Affairs
Parry had left it at that. Only a small
demand exists for the type he mentioned
—the speedy hack seen at Maori picnic
race meetings—but there is a North
Island shortage of draughts and half-
draughts. Harvesting has bumped up
prices for heavier types that were almost
unsaleable a few months ago. In Tara-
naki, where most roads are well surfaced,
motor transport has caused a steady de-
cline in their value for so long that there
is now a shortage of horses for farm
work. Half- and three-quarter draughts
have been bringing up to £5O, and values
in other well-roaded North Island dis-
tricts are nearly as high.
* * * *
“M.”: Sun, surf and sand were behind
the 26d.—top price—paid a Waiheke
farmer for seven bales of halfbred wool
at the recent Auckland sale. Japan
wanted the same lot, but in this instance
a Maoriland buyer operated without
apparent limit. The woollen manufac-
turing firm he represented was short of
bathing costumes ordered for the Christ-
mas trade—and wanted that Waiheke
wool to meet its orders. The lot was
shipped to Dunedin a day after the
northern sale, and young Maorilanders
will be wearing its contents into the surf
during the holidays.
* * * *
“Korero”: Smooth-water rowers in
Sydney and Melbourne would not
appreciate some of the swiftly-flowing
Maoriland courses where annual river
championships are decided. Taranaki
rowers take for granted the choppy, tidal
waters of the Waitara, and this probably
contributed to what was nearly a drown-
ing when club fours were about to de-
cide a local event a few weeks ago. Con-
ditions and light grew so bad that offi-
cials decided to abandon the race, but
before the crews could be recalled one
boat was swamped at the starting point.
Two club members —one of them a
sturdy provincial Rugby Union foot-
baller—went through rough water and
“Dont STAND there, you idiot—hunt ’er out of it!”
virtual darkness to save the cox. The
Waikato river at Hamilton, a major
Maoriland rowing centre, has a current
so swift that its races are always endur-
ance tests. Wanganui in the north and
the Avon in the south offer Maoriland
rowers their best river conditions.

“Waitot”: Another member of the
Mawson 1929-31 Antarctic research ex-
pedition is in the news; he is R. A.
Falla, the ornithologist, who has been
appointed director of the Canterbury
Museum from an international field of 24
applicants. Museums in S. Africa and
every Australian capital except Brisbane
have been visited by the 35-year-old Falla
in the course of his researches. In 1924
he accompanied Dr. Raymond Firth to
the Urawera country in the hills between
Taupo, Opotiki and Gisborne, and it
was after studies in that almost unex-
plored area that Firth wrote his authori-
tative book on the economic life of early
Maori communities. Falla himself is
publishing a book on the Antarctic birds
he hunted so tirelessly down south with
Douglas Mawson.
* * * *
“Xo”: Minister Parry’s “army” varied
its operations against Maoriland deer
(B. 9/12/’36) with a recent assault on
the wild pigs on Poor Knights Islands.
The Captain Cookers were exterminated.
This activity is part of the Labor Gov-
ernment’s policy to destroy pests killing
native plant and bird life. Maoriland
has numerous islands—Karewa, Mayor,
Mokohino, Hen and Chickens, and Three
Kings are just a few of the others —set
aside as sanctuaries for birds, reptiles
and plants. The reptiles do not include
snakes, but Maoriland has a few varie-
ties of the lizard family. More regular
policing of these reserves is a recent sug-
gestion, and Minister Parry would like to
introduce, some system of recording their
natural history development.
* * * *
“Tarry Rope”: Bringing the Awatea
into Sydney Harbor after a rough pas-
sage, Captain Davey made the challeng-
ing statement that, while Biscay is a bad
sea, “the Tasman in bad weather is the
worst in the world.” Biscay has always
treated me well, although once I crossed
after our steamer had been hove-to in
the Channel in a storm which made his-
tory ; • but I’m inclined to agree about
the Tasman. I have seen people go
down there after world travels during
which they escaped seasickness. Still I’ve
heard people say that the Bight can make
Biscay and Tasman look like duckponds.
* * * *
“Toto”: That curious phrase “taking
things by and large” found its way into
a summing-up the other day. It is terse
and expressive, and everyone knows that
it means “taking everything into con-
sideration,” but I always thought it was
a pure Americanism, having first encoun-
tered it 50 years ago in Bret Harte. And
probably it is American, though such
dictionaries as afford any information
on the subject give it' a nautical origin.
“Alternately well up to and off from
the wind: said of the. sailing of a vessel”
is one definition.
“Hutiwai’: The engagement of an
Australian band has closed the doors of
an Auckland (M.L.) cabaret —but this is
no reflection on Australian music.
Local unionists objected to the importa-
tion and, although the proprietors re-
engaged their old band, the players
refused to appear with the higher-paid
Australians. Cabarets live by variety,
and the unionists tossed away their own
jobs and those of the rest of the staff
when they failed to see there was more
in the importation than music. Secre-
taries of 26,000 unionists joined in the
cabaret squeal, though few of their
members ever venture into the atmo-
sphere of expensive syncopation. Maori-
land’s Cabinet is half Australian, but the
rest of Parliament has not yet declared
it black. Neither has black-listing fol-
lowed the importation by different Aus-
tralian interests of. numerous Maori-
landers. The. ill-considered Auckland
move might easily add a raspberry to
the oranges and potatoes already dis-
turbing responsible people on both sides
of the Tasman.
* * * *
“Kiwit”: Sale of Maoriland health
stamps (B. 18/11/ ’36) netted nearly £4OOO
in the first month, which, with donations,
made the four-week total almost £7500.
Australian interests pushing for penny
postage should note the slogan: “Penny
for postage, penny for health”—and the
latter is optional. This summer’s 14
health camps for undernourished children
are to share the campaign’s minimum
objective of £IO,OOO, but an infantile
paralysis scare which has already closed
schools will mean postponement until
the New Year.
* * * *
“Mak”: Dissatisfaction with official
publicity accorded South Island tourist
attractions (B. 11/11/ *36) is largely re-
sponsible for the South Island Travel
Association’s appointment of a salaried
director. Backed by words of cheer from
local bodies and interested organisations,
the association has
commissioned J. J.
W. Pollard, one-
time editor of the
Southland “Times,”
to chase the tourists.
People attracted
from overseas are
unlikely to sail again
without cr o s sing
Cook Strait to see
the rest of Maori-
land —so North
Islanders, who stand
a good chance of
benefiting from a
South Island enter-
prise that costs them
nothing, should be
loud in their praises.
Pollard, by the way,
was born in Mel-
bourne ; his father
was Tom Pollard,

SUNDRY BROADCASTS.
With their abdication broadcasts the
national people didn’t give listeners much
choice—rather, gave no choice. Unques-
tionably it was a momentous broadcast-
ing occasion, with the millions let in on
the ground floor, able to hear instantly
and together what was going on in what,
even at this short remove, begins to look
like one of the quaintest comedies of
kingship either the Empire or the world
has ever known. Its crowning—or, more
literally speaking, its uncrowning—act,
King Edward’s own broadcast, will
doubtless be lively fuel in the historical
hash-house of the future. As everybody
knows, the pathetic speech came through
well; and it and all the broadcasts lead-
ing up to it were a remarkable example
of the giddy heights to which broad-
casting has so rapidly risen and a sign-
post to the surprises waiting ahead.
It was all broadcasting extraordinary.
Nevertheless, it seemed to this listener
that the national people’s bright idea of
putting over the numerous recorded
repetitions simultaneously from the two
stations in one city was laying it on a
bit thick, or was bad policy at the least.
The repetitions themselves were quite in
order, but all possible purposes could
have been served by giving
them alternately instead
of simultaneously from
the stations. Then no-
body who wanted to hear
them would have missed
them, and those who had
had enough could have
found other entertain-
ment without leaving the
national circuit. Of course
it was a cheap way of
cluttering up the air, but
many who usually prefer
entertainment that' hasn’t
advertising in it must
have left the nationals
while the clumsy arrange-
ment lasted.
Friday nights are, of
course, the outcasts of the
br o a dcasting calendar.
Then are billed the things
that matter least. Books,
for instance. Most sta-
tions do books on Friday nights. When,
a year or two back, an elaborate series
of educational talks was arranged, it fell
out quite as an undiscussed matter of
course that Friday should be the book
night. But pigs—they had Monday,
Tuesday or Wednesday. Practical, solid
things, pigs.
Which isn’t to say that everything that
gets billed for Friday nights is second-
rate. A neat pair belonging to these
evenings are the 2BL duo, Judith Anne
and her Uncle John. In what vaudeville
would have billed as a patter act, Judith,
being a flapperish miss, represents—
who said significantly?—present-day
“thought.” Uncle represents the “pass-
ing culture.” They open with a sentence
or two which nicely sketch in their sur-
roundings, and are at once arguing ami-
ably, with touches of acid, the merits and
demerits of their periods One gathers
from one of these discussions that to be
really up to the minute a home should be
as bare as possible, certainly without any
pictures in it, or books, either. Every-
thing must be of practical use.
Judith Anne: I think the Japanese are
the best people to copy in furniture.
Unc.: Why ever the Japanese?
J.A. (with crushing emphasis): Because
they haven’t got any!
On “Clothes” another night, both very
good. The lass then gave it out to Unc.’s
bonification that she was at the moment
wearing only three pieces of clothing. It
was not stated whether two of these were
stockings.
It looks as if anybody ip search of
Poverty Point these days needs to take
a lift and barge in through the felt-
padded doors. If he does not find an old
familiar Poverty Pointer doing his bit
in front of the microphone he’ll only need
to wait a while and the P.P. will turn
up all right. What do the old Poverty
Pointers really think of it? Not much,
perhaps; although one of the best of
“The dangers of this world crisis cannot be
exaggerated , sir, and it is gratifying to
find you Australians wideawake to the
situation."
them in this ex-deadhead’s experience,
Frank Harvey, seemed enthusiastic about
the job when last encountered. Prob-
ably the fan-mail or something compen-
sates for the visible audience and the
handclaps. But here, where one of the
strongest strings to the histrionic bow —
gesture—is at an absolute discount, what
a severe disadvantage many of them,
especially the comedians, work under!
Among ’em that splitter of many sides
when musicomedy frothed lightly at
places like Her Majesty’s (now Wool-
worths), Alfred Frith, heard valiantly
trying the almost impossible task of mak-
ing a vaudeville turn sound good
broadcasting stuff. It isn’t; and wher-
ever —if ever —variety is revived it’s un-
likely that it will be in a broadcasting
studio. The sad truth is that what one
laughed most at with the light comedians
was pure mummery —their gestures and
their antics, their facial oddities and
contortions. These things, unfortunately,
do not broadcast very well; and in
Frith’s case recollection of what this first-
prize stage ass used to do with his face
did not make listening any happier.
Perhaps they’ll all come into their old
kingdom again with television.
It’s mighty easy to become accustomed
to extraordinary things. Now one has
to make a conscious effort and think
“Well, this is really very marvellous” to
get the kick that one should out of listen-
ing to something while it is happening
on the other side of the world. Instance
last week’s broadcast of the Bach Christ-
mas oratorio clearly heard from Leipzig,
Germany. Even the surroundings, the
atmosphere of the gathering, seemed to
come through with the voices, one or
two of these, in the solos, splendid to
hear. The illusion was heightened by the
accent of the announcer, helping to bring
place as well as sound into the room.
Musically, of course, these overseas
broadcasts are a washout. There is too
much doing in the air for the music to
be anything but makeshift, rising and
falling with all sorts of unrehearsed, and
unmusical, effects.
From Brisbane the start of the to-
Adelaide air race, very soundly done by
the national station announcer. An-
other purely novelty broadcast, with its
strongest appeal that to the sporting in-
stincts, it would seem; but as it was
done it was not bad general entertain-
ment and very good news reporting. The
announcer made Archerfield, the Bris-
bane crowd tumbled early out of bed
and the colorful parade of starting
’planes as good as visible. They are
getting extra good at this art of convey-
ing sweeping settings in a few words.
Noise of the starting ’planes, of course,
helped put over the atmosphere. The
announcer, who’d evidently flown ’planes
himself in his day, made a hero of a 19-
year-old D.H.9 —certainly a ’plane that
was flying during the war and is
still fit to kick off in a race is a hero in
its own right.
All Round the Dial.
“Macann”: The man specially em- ■
ployed in news gathering is coming in
broadcasting. One in Australia is the
Radio Roundsman, recently mentioned
in “Sundry Broadcasts,” his line, being
interviews with people in the news.
Then, of course, there are the describers
of sport —strictly speaking, reporters.
The 8.8. C. lately sent forth one who
really amounts to a special correspon-
dent. His job is to interview leading
churchmen in various parts of England
on “What Is the Church For,” later giv-
ing the results of his interviews in a
series of talks.

Pianist Marjorie Hesse, touring the
A.B.C. circuit, is a Brisbane girl who in
1929 won a Sydney Con. £5O scholarship
for highest marks in the State and three
years later won both the performers’ and
teachers’ diplomas. Last year she went
over to the Con. teaching staff, and this
year published two books of piano com-
positions for children —“When We Are
Very Young” and “Growing Up.” She
has composed other things, some of
which are included in her broadcasting
repertoire.
* * * *
“Uncle Willie”: When are they going
to teach lady radio-announcers to speak
naturally—or is it the fault of the
machine? Male voices come over satis-
factorily enough, but some female ones
are ridiculously stilted and elocutionary
or filled with a throaty huskiness.
* * * *
“Jachris”: National stations have one
very good news session, the British
Official Wireless News. In Sydney it
comes over the air at 8.15 a.m. (2BL),
and contains English news which does
not appear till the afternoon editions of
the newspapers. But it is the only one.
The local “news bulletins” are merely a
rehash of the morning papers’ news sum-
mary, and not always an intelligent re-
hash. For example, there will often be
reference to “a special article on page 11,”
without any indication of which paper
the summary has been lifted from. To
outback listeners especially, a carefully-
compiled resume of the news in all the
daily papers would be an excellent ser-
vice.

“D.8.K.”: With the burning of
London’s Crystal Palace went the Baird
television experimental section and its
valuable experiment. It was owing to
Baird’s unceasing effort
at the Crystal Palace
that London’s modern
television .station came
into being this year at
Alexandra Palace. In
one tower of the
Crystal Palace the tele-
vision gear was housed ;
in the other English
amateurs co n d ucted
ultra-short-wave radio
tests, some notable re-
sults being obtained
during 1934.

“X. Pol”: How much things are
changing in outback electioneering was
shown the other day when the Federal
Treasurer addressed meetings in Too-
woomba (Q.) by radio from Canberra.
Not long ago it took six weeks to carry
through a campaign in some Queens-
land electorates. At the rate we’re going
now, it won’t be long before we cease to
elect members and merely choose voices.
It might be a sounder idea if we con-
tinued to choose live members, but kept
them in their electorates, where we could
get at them, allowing them to carry on
their Parliamentary business by radio.
With the party system of discipline and
the gag, there’s so little independence
left that it seems scarcely worth while
their going to Canberra. They could
obey the political sergeant-majors just
as well over the air as in person.

“Dipole”: An Australian radio trade
weekly repeats as something out of the
ordinary a report appearing in an Eng-
lish radio publication that a French
amateur communicated on five metres
with another amateur in Corsica, cover-
ing a distance of 140 miles. More than
two years ago Queenslanders thought no-
thing of working over a 130-odd mile
path, and less than a year ago, VK4AW
was logged not far from Sydney on five
metres. VK4AW is in Brisbane, which
is quite a few hundred miles from Syd-
ney. Australian “hams” are not lag-
ging when it comes to proving the un-
expected with five-metre, communica-
tion ; in Sydney alone quite a number
can show commercial practice a thing
or two with directional radiating sys-
tems for ultra-shorts.

An Electron-coupled 56mc.
Receiver.
This stjiall receiver is suggested as a
stopgap in the graduation from
super-regenerators to receivers for
C.W. communication. Until the
experimenter can devote his time
and energy to the development of
comprehensive superhets, a receiver
such as this may prove useful in
DX searching.
The five-metre band may never de-
velop into a DX medium for radio com-
munication, but it is the lure of the
long chance which attracts the true ex-
perimenter. In various parts of the
world signals have been heard over long
distances at this relatively high fre-
quency, and quite a number of instances
have been reported of C.W. telegraphic
signals. The designing of the big
superhet necessary for such work is not
easy, but the difficulties can be over-
come. Such a receiver has recently been
built by the writer and will be described
in detail later.
Meanwhile, this simple two-valve re-
generative detector and audio receiver is
described as a five-metre C.W. stepping-
stone. It works well and involves no
complication. All that is necessary is to
observe rigidity in the tuned circuit and
to provide a smooth and positive action
tuning control.
A 6C6 is used as detector and a 38 or
41 pentode audio for ’phones. The 6C6
is an excellent five-metre detector, and,
if desired, a 954 Acorn can be used to
-advantage with no alteration in con-
stants.
The circuit diagram shows the arrange-
ment. Regeneration is controlled by the
usual 50,000-ohm screen potentiometer,
and oscillation by placing the cathode of
the detector above earth through a five-
metre R.F. choke.
The tuning condenser is important,
and, although a 15mmfd. isolantite insu-
lated midget' is applicable, better control
of tuning and assurance of silent bear-
ings are afforded by using two such con-
densers ganged as a series-gap tuner.
Raymart condensers (Price’s Radio, Syd-
ney) are strongly recommended.
Coil LI has seven turns of 14
enamelled copper, iin. diameter, and is
soldered directly across the condenser.
If a 954 is used as detector, nine turns
are needed to cover the five-metre band.
The five-metre chokes, R.F.C. 1 and
2, are made up on fin. glass tubing (old
pigtailed resistors) with 35 to 40 turns
of 36 D.S.C. Transformer coupling is
used, and, although this may seem poor
practice for an R.F. pentode coupling, it
works quite well.
The aerial can be coupled to the grid
end of LI by simply wrapping a turn
or so round the grid lead. Coil Lis in-
tended for doublet aerial coupling, and
consists of two or three turns around the
“cold” end of LI. Provision should be
made for variation of coupling, accord-
ing to aerial load. If too tight, the de-
tector will not oscillate in places.
Reaction control is very smooth and
gradual, and it was found that the 954
super-regenerates nicely when 135 volts
B is used and the potentiometer set well
past ordinary oscillation point.
Thus such a receiver is doubly useful.
Listening to local modulated oscillator
five-metre stations with ordinary oscil-
lation is an interesting experience ; they
cannot be understood until the receiver
is adjusted for super-regeneration. Har-
monics of crystal-controlled 40- and 20-
metre stations can be listened to quite
normally. For C.W. possibilities on
'five,” such a little receiver is well worth
building. It is a handy standby in the
writer’s station and is due to have a
tuned R.F. stage added for trial.

The Question Box.
(1) I have a six-valve 1934 model superhet
which gives good daylight reception 450 miles
north of Brisbane. Stations heard under these
conditions average eight, varying according to
weather. Would a change to a more modern
type secure better results? (2) What is the best
height for the aerial? —468.
(1) You would be well advised to retain
the old set, unless battery consumption is a
problem. Receivers of more recent design
might be more economical, but might not be
more sensitive. A good plan would be to try
to secure a receiver only for a trial. (2) Any-
where above 30ft. in height, and not exceeding
a total length of 100 ft. If a very high support
is available, a vertical or semi-vertical aerial
might be worth a trial.
v
(1) Is the back issue of The Bulletin con-
taining the description of the Wide-World Four
obtainable? (2) The set was accidentally
“shorted,” and each valve appeared to light up
brilliantly, accompanied by a fizzing sound. The
15 -type valve seemed to be free from the trouble.
Are the valves likely to be damaged? —467.
(1) Two copies only of B. 2/1 /’35 remain.
You can obtain one by sending Bd. to this
office. (2) Although the 15 valve may have
escaped damage, it is a certainty that the
directly-heated two-volt types such as the 32,
30 and 19 are of no further use. The emis-
sion will be lost, though the filaments may still
exist.
* * * *
(1) My set, an old tuned R.F. model, using
4.435, 4415 and two J 3406 valves, two .0003 m/d.
variable condensers, a small fixed condenser and
two A.W.A. Ideal transformers, is subject to
fading and slipping out of tune, causing stut-
tering. Selectivity is good. How can the trouble
be cured? (2) Any way to improve loudness?
• —466.
(1) May be caused by a bad contact in a
tuned circuit. Examine tuning condensers for
poor connection between rotor and frame (also
thence to earth return). A faulty audio trans-
former could be responsible; also B batteries.
(2) This can only be done by improving the
audio portion, but in so doing battery drain
will be increased. A Class B audio channel
might be worth con-
sideration, but there is
no four-volt Class B
battery valve available
in Australia. A change
to two-volt valves
throughout would be
advisable if Class B is
incorporated.

Enclosed is an adver-
tisement of a compact
aerial. Is it efficient?
—465.
The device illustrated
is not likely to be reso-
nant at any frequency
approx imating the
broadcast band. It is
merely a collector. Any
similar length of wire
would do just the same
thing, with the excep-
tion that the advertised
article would have
somewhat more self-
capacity. However, if
your set works satis-
factorily when using
this “aerial” perhaps
that is all you need. If
long distance is wanted,
a well-elevated external
aerial of about 80ft.
length, with a good earth connection, should
be installed.
Amateur Radio Chatter.
Two years ago, when VK2BP was
located in Hazelbrook (Blue Mountains),
Sydney five-metre men had an outstand-
ing DX station for tests over a 50-mile
signal path. This high-elevation station
has been missing owing to the owner’s
change of address, but word is to hand
from the operator
that he will be on
the air again from
the vicinity of
Katoomba early in
1937. This is good
news. Hours of
searching the five-
metre band have
brought mostly
silence during recent
weeks, apart from
two successful tests
with a ship off the
coast. No real five-
metre DX is reported
from anywhere, and
no such thing will
happen in VK unless
stations are con-
stantly and pains-
takingly active
The 10-metre band
gets a big share
of DX attention, and 20 metres is the
mecca of the DX ’phone chasers as
usual. Static has been riding the latter
band rather heavily; 40 is a rattle of
machine-gun noise, and there is a verit-
able crash of Howitzers on 80. On a
night full of such noises a prominent
U.S.A. 20-metre ’phone, was heard to
ask a VK3 to “listen for my ’phone on
75 metres.” Surely an optimist with no
inkling of Australian lower frequency
conditions during summer.
A complaint has been received from
M.L. that certain VKs have been using
mythical' calls to attract DX in “off”
periods. They provide a glaring example
of how not to play the game. Here is
one for M.L. in reply. Why do some
ZLs make a welter of CQ? A ZL2 was
heard to CQ on 20m. no fewer than
65 times, and then to sign once. “Rotten
operating” is the proper title for such a
story. However, VKs are by no means
exempt from this, as a dial-twisting ses-
sion reveals.
VK2NO.
Radio Comment.
“Sach”; In G. Ward Price’s In
Morocco with the Legion, published in
1934, he said; “In the middle of our
fortified camp sat a wireless operator
with receivers on his ears. He was in
communication with a portable set car-
ried by Col. Richert’s party out ahead
of us. Over a range of three miles or so
these small sets work, I was told, very
well. In a European war their signals
would be blanketed.” Apparently the
device in use was very much like the
A Mark II set used by the military from
brigade to brigade and brigade to bat-
talion. Reference to signals being
blanketed in a European war raises all
sorts of doubts. In the “S. M. Herald”
of a few weeks ago appeared a photo-
graph of naval ratings using a portable
The Marconi-Stille recording machine used by the B.B.C. for

wireless transmitter and receiver during
manoeuvres. The Navy wouldn’t use
apparatus that could be put out of gear
by the enemy. But the point I am most
interested in is that in the middle of
Africa W/T signals should be used. No
mention is made of V/T.
The All Dry-cell Receiver.
A correspondent with little technical
knowledge of radio, having noted com-
petition between B battery-less and bat-
tery receivers, asks if it is possible to
build receivers powered entirely by dry
batteries.
“Getting accumulators charged is the
bane and bugbear of many outback lis-
teners,” he says, “and I feel sure that if
a set could be produced without the A
battery it would have a big sale. Mine is
an old-fashioned three-valve affair of the
oblong cabinet type, using four-volt
valves, two 45-volt Bs and a 2i-volt C.
Nearest charging station is 20 miles dis-
tant, and I always keep two As, one either
on charge or ready to put in. I have no
means of getting my accumulators to the
charging station save by a butcher’s truck
from another township which occasion-
ally goes to the town in which the charg-
ing station is located. .My As usually last
from four to five weeks, running about
20 hours per week. The flat one is sent
off to be charged after the other has
been in use about three weeks. Recently
it was nearly a month before I got it
back, only to find that it hadn’t been
charged at all. I had no radio for an-
other fortnight.”
This experience is probably typical, so
some explanation of the possibilities of
dry-cell A operation and other sources
of supply may be of use to many.
Provided the receiver does not use
more than three valves, which must be
of the two-volt .06-ampere variety, it is

Export Lambs Again.
“Yeoman”: Roseworthy College (S.A.)
is experimenting to find out the most
profitable lamb to raise for export. The
first step was to determine the best half-
bred breeding-ewe for export production.
Dorset Horn, Romney Marsh, Border
Leicester and Corriedale rams were
mated with merino ewes, and the wether
progeny marketed at a live weight of
721 b.
The ewe lambs were kept as founda-
tion half-bred ewes and mated with
Southdown rams. The following table
gives the results of the first stage:
Live Days
Weight, to Price Value
Cross. lb. Mature. Realised. of Skin.
D. Horn-
Merino.. 72 93 17s. 4d. 2s. Bd.
R. Marsh
Cross .. • 72 • 105 16s. lOd. . 3s. 4d.
Corriedale
Cross .. 72 107 15s. 7d. 3s. 4d.
B. Leicester
Cross ... 72 107 16s. Id. 3s. 3d.
The superiority of the Dorset cross for
< early-maturing lambs is obvious. ■ The
extra value of the lambs is also evident.
But the Dorset-merino breeding-ewe has
the disadvantage, of growing a fleece low
in value. ' •
Breeding-ewes for raising export lambs
must grow a profitable fleece.: For 'this
purpose it is difficult to improve on the
Corriedale,ewe and the Border Leicester-
merino half-bred ewe' as crosses.
On the other hand, it' is doubtful if
any cross or combination can be as profit-
able as the large-framed merino ewe
mated with the Dorset or Southdown
ram.
Sheep-carrying Costs.
“Bungaree”: The other day I asked a
man about a mob of wethers he had
bought at what I considered a stiff price.
“Made sixpence, on them —not too bad,”
he replied. . What he. had really done was
sold them at 6d. a head more than he
paid—after keeping them for four
months. How few graziers know what it
costs them to run a sheep!
It has been worked out at 4s. 6d.
per head per year. Six-tooth wethers
bought off-shears at 20s. and car-
ried for 12 months would net about
14s. for wool' on the present market.
Full-woolled wethers would, therefore,,
be worth 345., plus 4s. 6d. —38s. ,6d. on
the books—and after shearing would
stand the owner in at 10s. 6d. a head
At the end of another year They would
have cost ■ 155., and , a similar. market
would clear the original expenditure and
leave, their, off-shears value as profit.
The sheep, of . course, will'be two years
older and their value accordingly lower
even on a market similar to that on which
they were bought.
That is the rosy side of the picture.
Consider the figures if, after carrying for
12 months, the sheep cuts 10s. worth of
wool, which is the average allowance. c
The sheep still costs 4s. 6d. to run' There-
fore, its book value off-shears as a.
full-mouthed wether is 14s. 6d. The effect
of the drop in wool would probably leave
that figure above the price offered for
wethers of that age off-shears, but if the
owner sells at less than 14s. 6d. he is.
losing on the deal. If the wool market
drops again the following year, and the
sheep cut. an average of Bs. per head,
their cost is now 14s. 6d., plus 4s. 6d.,
minus Bs., or 11s. per head for wethers
rising six years, which the owner may
get if he is lucky and the- season good.
But at that price he has carried them for
two years without making a penny on
them.
The cost of running a sheep varies
not only in different districts but even on
adjoining properties. The figure is arrived
at by dividing by the average number of
sheep carried on the property the sum of
all expenses (except shearing, which
comes under wool account), including
crutching, jetting, dipping, drenching,
licks, anti-blowfly outlay, wages, rent,
taxes, insurance, droving, percentage
written off against losses, maintenance of
improvements and interest.
Bush-trees as Stock Feed.
“Zedo”: in recent Brisbane tests the
narrow-leafed brigalow from round Chin-

here—I don't Want to get into any trouble with your authorities!"

These are water-free contents. Saltbush
has about a 75 p.c. water content, which-
is a strong argument for the expansion of
its growth in the west. Its nutritive value
is from 13 to 19, according to variety,
against N. S. Wales Agricultural Depart-
ment’s rating of green lucerne at 18.5.
It has a better nutritive value than most
green fodders, but only a quarter that of
wheaten or lucerne hay and a bit worse
than a fifth that of maize.
Most of the common scrub plants have
a high nutritive value, though some of
the best for drought purposes are those
which have a larger water content but
are otherwise not quite so nourishing a
ration. Kurrajong is rated 47, cattle-gum
(Eucalyptus coriacice ) 59.3, wilga 40.7,
mulga 30.7, ••gidya-about the same as
mulga; myall runs a trifle less. Wattle
(Acacia decurrens ) goes as high as 70.2
in inland regions.
Sfringybark stands, at 57.9 and has a
water content of 39.5. The highest water
content in the leaves of western trees is in
wilga (49.3 p.c.) and myall (48.5 p.c.).
These are all N. S. Wales figures:' there,
is considerable variation.
Has anybody, ever had any real success
with tree-leaf or saltbush silage? It
‘ should be worth trying.
Calf-sucking.
“Silky Bag”: Feeding with ground
grain or pollard after skim-milk is said
to dry the calf’s mouth, but it doesn’t
prevent sucking. Much the same can
be said of painting bitter aloes over the
teats; most calves seem to thrive on lick-
ing the stuff, off.
For straightout protection nose har-
ness is effective. This is simply a ring
of stiff leather (old trace, etc.),' into
which the nose fits, with an adjustable
holding strap over the neck, riveted at-
the sides. The ring is studded most of ;
the way round with r l|in. flait-top nails
driven from inside, outwards. Few
calves will get near enough to another
to suck with this harness on.
The best method of all is to tie-, the
calves up separately an hour before and.
two hours after feeding. A fence or row
of stakes, with a good, long dog-chain
for each, is all that is needed. Of course
they must be tied well out of reach of
each other.
If not prevented sucking often causes
distortion to growing udder tissues, re-
sulting in poor or lopsided growth of
the bag at its most delicate develop-
ment period.
When to Breed Heifers.
“Mookau”: Some years ago the 10
leading youngsters in the Jersey Merit
Register were experimented with to
termine this ; also, nearly 1800 other in-
dividual records were studied. The re-
search seemed to show conclusively that
the best age for a first freshing is at 26
months.
Mated to freshen before that age,
heifers under most conditions do not
appear to be mature enough to do their
job properlyif left longer they are apt
to get spinsterish and lose some of their
maternal instinct.
Therefore, put the youngsters to the
bull at 16 to 17 months.
Dehorning.
“Bullocky”: While Australian cattle-
men still like to see a horn on a beast,
other countries which hold the best of the
British beef import market and get the
best of the prices generally practise de-
horning.
Horned animals are unknown in the
Argentine export trade ; in U.S.A. most
high-class herds are dehorned; and the
Canadian Government has decided to
pay a dollar bonus on all unhorned
animals suitable for export beef.
The mark of the horn costs the Aus-
tralian meatgrower many a pound.
Bullock Ploughing.
“Old Wagon”: Now that horse prices
are high the bullock should be worth re-
installing jn the plough.
A century ago crack ox teams could
give horses a good run for their money
at the ploughing matches then general
in Europe. At one in 1833, at War-
minster (Eng.), oxen beat six horse teams
hands down both in cheapness and effi-
ciency. Lord Somerville, about that time,
carried on his tillage at the rate of 80
acres to four oxen. Twelve oxen worked
30 acres of land per week, when not em-
ployed in carrying manure or lime.
They were worked—without corn —for
1\ hours a day.
Another set of teams, “sixteen oxen
and steers, a proportion of which were
too young to do much,” ploughed 237
acres in a season in hilly country, and
at the end were in good condition and
even in high flesh. The soil was a fine,
free-working loam, and 105 acres were
second ploughings. About the same time
also on a Sherwood Forest farm 100 acres
were entirely cultivated by four bullocks.
There are hundreds of such instances
of bullock ploughing on record. But the
world seems since to have gone horse-
and tractor-proud.
The best all-round farm draught animal
1 have seen is the Turkish manda. He
is a small, compact, hard-looking, grey-
ish buffalo of docile habits. He looks out
on the world with the cynical expression
of W: M. Hughes, whom he seems to
resemble in physique. He appears to sur-
vive without eating. But haul —he could
haul a Federal Minister off his portfolio.
Hay Technique.
“Lam”: In the English southern coun-
ties grass for hay is always cut in the
early morning, cutting time being when
the seed has formed but before it has
reached, maturity. The theory of this
is that at that stage the saccharine con-
tent and feed value of the plant is at

its highest. The cut grass is immedi-
ately tedded out, every lump being
shaken and strewn equally over the
ground to ensure even heating in
the stack. The grass is again turned in
the morning when the sun is high.
After lunch, the morning’s cut work is
raked into single windrows about four
feet apart; finally it is put up into grass
cocks and left for the night.
Meanwhile, mowers have been at work
all day cutting more grass for tedding
next morning.
On the second day, the first day’s
cocks are shaken out into “staddles,” or
flats about six feet in diameter. The
flats are. turned over before midday and
allowed to dry some more. In the after-
noon the “staddles” become double
windrows about eight feet apart, and
these are put into “bastard cocks” be-
fore sundown. These, again next morn-
ing become “staddles,” and are given
another drying and turning on the third
day. If the weather is fine the hay is
dry enough to carry in that afternoon,
and is turned into full-sized cocks and
taken to the stacks, where it is carefully
laid down.
The stack is usually on a foundation
—stones or hard compost slightly raised
or timber in the bark —to secure the
bottom from damp. The hay is then
built' in and thatched with wetted wheat
or rye straw. Many farmers ventilate
their hayricks with funnels inserted in
the stacks.
The greatest care is taken with every
stage of the work; and nobody who has
not seen English meadow hay at its best
really knows what' fragrant fodder is.
We are a careless lot in such matters.
Carting Lucerne.
“Stump Jump”: Many will find it
hard to agree with “Albarmount’s”
way of carting lucerne hay on the
day it is cut (B. 25 /11 / ’36).
The method is common, but I know
of no better way to get stacks full of
“white-musty” hay than this, although
“Albarmount” avers that if there is mois-
ture present all it will do is turn green
hay into “brown.” Actually the latter
—admittedly very palatable —has to be
made with much moister hay, half-
ensilage style. Even then it loses a third
of its protein.
In making and stacking hay in mid-
summer the cut crop should be. at once
made into cocks for the loader, each not
too large to dry as a comfortable fork-
ful. The shape, of cocks is important—•
the higher they are capped, and the
narrower they are at the base, the better,
because then when settled and dry each
is compact' enough to be lifted without
collapsing or straggling ends falling off.
Cocks made like this can be carted
all day with little waste, of leaf, though
between 5 and 11 a.m. is the best cart-
ing time. After a little practice a pitcher
can load his own lorry, obviating further
leaf loss through trampling —and over 75
p.c. of the protein is in the leaves.
Growing Gums.
“L. de F.”: Recently met a settler
(native-born, too) collecting nuts from a
white gum to plant —in furrows along a
fence as a breakwind and timber supply.
The seed had fallen out through tiny
openings in the nuts weeks before. Even
if it had been there it would have been
uselessly buried in the hard, woody con-
tainer. The. seed of most gums is fine as
dust; several dozen could sit comfort-
ably on a pin’s head. Even the seeds of
the scarlet flowering gum are mere flakes.
It is one of Nature’s best jokes that such
large frees are produced from such small
beginnings.
Most eucalypts are winter-flowering.
Seeds ripen and fall in millions a
month or so later, leaving empty nuts
hanging indefinitely. The fine and
quickly-perishable seeds must' find sur-
face warmth and moisture sufficient for
germination. If they germinate, moisture
must be continuous until they can get
roots down into suitable soil and find
their own supplies. Only an odd one will
find such happy landings. Ideal conditions
are rare in forest; they practically never
exist for an isolated tree in a paddock.
Ants, too, account for millions of un-
born trees, carrying the seed continu-
ously to their nests.
Conditions suited to the fine seed of
tobacco will suit gums. Sow on a soil
bed retentive, of moisture and contain-
ing plenty of humus. Don’t use fresh
or artificial manure. Water must be
applied without disturbing the seed. And
shade and shelter from wind and strong
sun are necessary for success.
Coastal Silage.
“Y. Dent”: Maize and sorghum, in
that' order, are best crops for silage on
the N.S.W. coast. Merit of maize is in its
high yielding capacity and feedng value.
More fodder can be produced from an
acre of maize as silage than from any
other crop. Up to 40 tons an acre has
been recorded.
Three to four acres of green maize
should produce around 60 tons of feed,
enough for 30 head of cattle for four
months. Fitzroy, Learning and Hickory
King are most suitable.
Maize should be cut for silage when
the grain is beginning to dent and the
lower leaves are turning yellow. It is
then at its top feed value ; there is but
slight loss of leaves, and moisture con-
tent is ideal for ensiling.
Sorghum is little inferior to maize, and
better suited to poorer soils. The crop
should be cut for silage when well in
head.
Feeding value of maize or sorghum
silage is improved if some coarse legumes
—cowpeas or soy beans —are mixed.
Warrigal Spinach.
“E.S.”: When so much havoc is being
caused by soil erosion and sand-drifts
in the north-western parts of N.S.W., it
is surprising that more use is not made
of warrigal spinach, one of the best
drought-resisting plants in the country
for checking shifting sands.
Many plants that grow in the coastal
regions, including redweed and fat hen,
are wrongly called warrigal spinach,
which accounts for the various opinions
expressed concerning it. The real thing
is a valuable fodder of recumbent habit,
and an excellent bush vegetable. It is
also known as Flinders cabbage and
Thomson spinach, and is widely dis-
tributed over the arid part's of the coun-
try, favoring sandy situations and grow-
ing freely in the hottest and driest
weather.
Each plant covers several feet of
ground, and, having good binding roots,
deeply penetrating, it is highly suitable
for planting in parts of the country where
sand-drifts are common, as west of the
Darling. Bare sand patches may be
sown with the seed, but stock need to be
kept off it till the plants are well rooted
and show a heavy top of leafage.
Hints for the Farm.
“Rusticus”: In ringing a pig the
hardest job is to keep its nose motion-
less. With a pig of any size up to bacon
weight, I know of no better method
than to get the grunter on its back or
side, place the knee on its stomach and
hold the front and rear legs nearest the
ground. In this position the animal is
too concerned in getting accustomed to
a new view of the scenery to worry
about waggling the snout.
“Gumblegubbin”: When liming the
walls of a slab fowlhouse, make the lime
fairly thin and spray it on with a garden
syringe. This does the job on a rough
surface much quicker than a brush, and
gets the lime into all the cracks.
“Mulyan”: Hardwood weatherboards
make as good roofs for sheds as they do
walls, but very few people outside
Europe think of using them in this way.
They take less timber than shingles, and
are easier and simpler to put on. End
joints should be covered with pitch or
a slip of sheet lead. Though, if the roof
is painted, the paint will suffice for
closely-joined ends.
“Karaway”: Agree with “Lam” (B.
2/12/’36) that there would be better
orchards and farms if the owners kept
bees ; but provision has to be made for
the bees in all seasons. Orchards and
farm crops carry them only half the
year, and if there is nothing else to gather
from they’ll want their store of honey
to keep them the other half. Most
farms are nearly bare of native trees and
shrubs, and little attention is given to
flower gardens. It is profitable in every
way to plant trees and flowering shrubs
and to have a large flower garden,
specialising in winter-flowering plants;
also patches of clover in the paddock.
And lucerne will help.
“Booraby”: An old crosscut saw can
be converted into many useful farm
tools, such as butchers’ knives, bread
knives and meat-choppers. Two pieces
of flat wood, an inch to an inch and a
half wide, riveted on, are all that is
necessary for a handle. The saw blade
will make into chipping hoes and excel-
lent bells. But skill is needed to con-
vert the saw into these.

“Spurs”: The cavalry of Genghis
Khan and his followers (B. 9/12/’36)
had one advantage which alone made
their success possible. They rode mares,
like the Asiatic Arabs who came after
them, and if the resources of the country
over which they swarmed failed them
they lived on the soured milk of the
steeds they bestrode— koumiss, the staple
food of their Kirghis descendants to-day
—as well as on the flesh of the dead
horses which perished from overwork
or in action. It is to be noted in this
regard that immense hordes of “spares”
accompanied these armies, living, like
their masters, as best they could.
* * * *
“Upper Tooting”: In these days when
the loyalty of the Empire is sometimes
called in question it is refreshing to read
of the Nigerian Emir, who recently
visited London with family and suite.
His first request was to be taken to see
Bov/ Bells. This done he extracted a
sooty brat from his entourage and pushed
him forward. “Dis one a cockney for
true,” he said. “He make born in sound
of Bow Bells—on de wireless.”

The abdication message broadcast over
the Australian network of radio stations
by the P.M. differed from that delivered
in the Commons. The royal witnesses,
according to Lyons, were “my two
brothers the Duke of York and the Duke
of Kent.” The Duke of Gloucester, lost
somewhere between England and Aus-
tralia, was included in the Commons
statement.

Dr. Inez Parer, back in Victoria after
five months abroad, is an honorary sur-
geon at the, Queen Victoria Hospital,
Melbourne. She found in all her travels
only one institution similar to it' in being
staffed by women and entirely for women.
Language proved no difficulty in Vienna,
where on arrival’foreign graduates seek
out the American Medical Association,
and discover that lectures on all subjects
are given in English. According to Dr.
Parer, Viennese professors have a genius
for teaching, and impart practical and
theoretical knowledge in a manner easily
remembered and understood. Graduates
can get a famous surgeon to “tutor”
them singly, in pairs or small groups
through all kinds of operations. But a
long purse is necessary, for fees are very
high. The U.S.A., for its part, cannot do
enough for overseas graduates of either
sex, and no charges are made for the ex-
perience of clinic or hospital work.
* * * *
“Motu”: A thoughtless prank in an
outback Taranaki cheese factory wears
a different complexion when it ends with
the Maoriland High Commissioner.
James Parr, back from that post in
London, tells of a cheese he saw with a
scrubbing-brush resting coyly in its
centre ; the same complaining firm pro-
duced an envelope of glass, once part of
a thermometer, which it found in some
Maoriland butter.
H*
“Bezoman”: A Sydney daily boldly
predicted that the eighth Edward's suc-
cessor would be enshrined in history as
Albert I. I suggest that it would have
been wrong altogether. The lone John
in English royal annals wasn’t John
1., and I doubt if George I. was any-
thing more than plain George until the
second of his name arrived.
* * * *
“Treasury”: It isn’t often that a
British Government department permits
itself a frivolous jape. In a report the
Auditor-General to the Public Accounts
Committee explained that a certain set
of figures had been delayed because of
an error running into some millions.
The young female in charge of a comp-
tometer had forgotten to clear her
machine of figures before starting on
another lot. The official remarked that
this was probably the worst case of the
association of a flapper and an adder
since Eve and the serpent.
* * * *
“Qwakprak”: Some curiously interest-
ing work is being done in London re-
search labs, on the production of cancer
among white mice by chemical deriva-
tives of tar. One substance, when
scratched into the skin, will cause that
form of cancer, carcinoma, which par-
ticularly selects the older age-groups
among humans. If injected, it causes
sarcoma, the form which may occur at
any human age, but usually affects rela-
tively young people. Hormones, the sub-
stances which determine sex and sex
activity, have also been found to pro-
duce curious results in mice, not only
cancerous growths but such unexpected
effects as large hernias and absorption of
the cartilages of the pelvis. With certain
hormonic derivatives, immense cancer
growths may be caused, which gradually
disappear when the substances are no
longer administered. But, so far, there
is no real light on the subject of a
specific cure for cancer.
* * * *
“El V.”: Mrs. Simpson, I read, is
descended from Pagan de Warfield, a
“knight who came over with William the
Conqueror.” If her father could trace his
descent in the male line for 900 years
the old man managed something that
the British peerage and Royalty itself
have never come within striking distance
of doing. It is true that such claims
have been made, but, as there were no
genealogical records of any sort in Eng-
land before the fourteenth century, no-
body takes them very seriously. Even
placing the average generation at 30 years
— an d in the Middle Ages it was con-
siderably less—29 generations separate us
from the day of William’s landing in
England. And 29 generations ago each
of us had, if there was no inbreeding,
551,628,032 direct ancestors—which was
probably about the whole population of
the world. On the other hand, Aus-
tralia’s George Knibbs showed that the
progeny of a single pair increasing at the
rate of 1 p.c. would be equal to the
whole present population of the world in
1900 years. So who knows? All of us
may be lineal descendants of Pontius
Pilate.

Origin of term “squatter” ? —4OBO.
In U.S.A. early last century the term was
applied to a settler who had no normal or legal
title to the land he occupied, and especially to
those thus occupying land in districts not sur-
veyed or apportioned by the Government. In
Australia at a slightly later period it signified a
person occupying a tract of pastoral land as a
Crown tenant. Later it became applicable to
any grazier or sheepfarmer operating on a large
scale.

Brief history of the Oxford Group? —3B9o.
A religious movement within the Church of
England, though its founder was an American
Methodist minister, the Rev. Frank Buchman.
It represents ail attempt to revive the spirit of
first-century Christianity, stress being laid upon
confession, self-dedication and spiritual guid-
ance. The name arises from the fact that the
movement in England first took root at Oxford.

In what years and at what places have the
Olympic Games been held in modern times? —

Revived in 1896, the first Olympic Games
of modern times were. held at Athens, the
ancient stadium being renovated for the pur-
pose. The games were then held at four-yearly
intervals, except for a break occasioned by the
war. The location in 1900 was Paris, 1904 the
St. Louis Exposition, 1906, Athens, 1908
London, 1912 Stockholm, 1920 Antwerp, 1924
Paris, 1928 Amsterdam, 1932 Los Angeles and

What are the policy and principles of (1)
Communism, (2) Socialism, (3) Fascism, (4)
Nazism, (5) Sovietism or Bolshevism? —3973.
(1) and (2) stand for collective ownership of
the means of production, distribution and ex-
change. The distinction between them as popu-
larly understood is that Communists are pre-
pared to enforce their ideas, Socialists (in de-
mocracies, at any rate) look for success at elec-
tions. (3) and (4) stand (practically if not quite
in theory) for rule by a despot whose authority
is based on military force. (5) Commenced as
Marxian Communism mixed with despotism;
seems to be modulating into a democratic-cum-
capitalistic form of society.

Some particulars about Tom Midwood, a
Tasmanian artist? —4047.
Tasmania’s first caricaturist, he was born in
Hobart, 1855. He went to sea; for a time
toured with a musical co. in U.S.A.; was a
skilful player of the banjo, the guitar and the
mandolin, and contributed to the “British
Musical Gazette” and an American journal,
the “Cadenza.” Returning to Hobart, he was
employed in the drafting department of the
Public Works Office, and contributed carica-
tures to the “Tasmanian Mail” and the “Critic.”
In the ’nineties he made caricatures of most of
Hobart’s leading citizens. He died at Hobart
in 1912.

What is the best method of killing ticks on
dogs? 1 have tried derris root powder, but
the ticks simply revel in it. Is it more effec-
tive used as a wash, and, if so, how is it
applied? —39B4.
When derris powder is applied to ticks
already attached to a dog the ticks do not im-
mediately die, but on the following day they
will all be dead and dried up. After applying
the powder to the dog ticks may get on it and
reattach quite soon, but if they get on the dog
within three days after the powder has been
applied they will die without engorging. To
make a derris powder wash, add one heaped
tablespoon of the powder to one gallon of
water in which one tablespoon of. soap flakes
has been dissolved. Mix thoroughly. After
washing the dog should be exercised to drain off
the surplus fluid, or this may be taken off by
drying roughly. The wash, like the powder,
does not kill ticks instantaneously or prevent
others attaching, but will kill the latter for three
days after bathing.

Is Cinesound Productions, Ltd., of Sydney,
interested in Australian scenarios? —4066.
The co. is prepared to consider Australian
scenarios, which should be accompanied by a
1000- to 1500-word synopsis of the action,
with particulars of locale and period. The co.
is, however, more interested in published novels,
not necessarily stories of Australian life, than
original scenarios. The general preference is
for modern stories with plenty of action.

(1) How long does a falling body take to
attain its maximum velocity ? (2) Do all
bodies fall at the same rate? —4000.
(1) In air, the time taken will depend on mass
and shape. A piece of paper will attain its
maximum almost immediately; a piece of metal
may hit the earth before its maximum is
reached. In a vacuum the speed of all bodies
increases at the rate of approximately 32ft. per
second, irrespective of mass and shape. This
acceleration, due to gravitation, varies slightly
at different places on the earth’s surface. (2)
Only in a vacuum.

when dissolved in water, but this method is
impracticable for the production of ice since
the operation cannot be repeated often enough
or rapidly enough to keep the temperature down.
Under favorable conditions a test tube of water
may be frozen as follows: Prepare a 10 p.c.
dilution of sulphuric acid in water. Place this
in a stone jar and allow to cool. Add a hand-
ful of Glauber’s salt for each quart of solu-
tion. The temperature will fall sharply, and
the cooler the solution is to start with the
lower the resulting temperature will be. Place
the test tube in the solution.

Translation of the following French passage
and who wrote it: “Les abeilles pillotent deed
dela les fleurs; mais elles en font aprez le miel,
qui est tout leur; ce n’est plus thym, ny marjo-
laine: ainsi les pieces empruntees d’aultruy, il
les transformera et confondra pour en faire un
ouvrage tout sien” ? —4099.
It was written by Montaigne. In English it
reads: “The bees pillage the flowers here and
there, but they make honey of them which is all
their own; it is no longer thyme or marjorlaine:
so the pieces borrowed from others he will
transform and mix up into a work all his own.”

What are, in N. S. Wales, subsidised schools ?
What educational qualification must the teacher
have ? —4102.
Small, semi-private schools in thinly-popu-
lated areas where there are not sufficient chil-
dren to form an ordinary public school.
Usually the school is conducted in a family
home. The teacher is engaged by parents,
who provide accommodation and payment.
This payment is subsidised by the Education
Department on a sliding scale, according to
number of children. The schools are subject to
supervision by departmental inspectors. The
teacher is required to hold the intermediate
certificate.
* * *
Was Disraeli the first to refer to a London
hansom-cab as “a gondola on wheels” ? —4064.
No; H. Schiitz Wilson claimed to have
originated it in a novel The Three Paths (1859),
but Balzac in Physiologie du Manage (1829) de-
scribed French cabs (fiacres) as “ces gondoles
Parisiennes,” and a satirical verse entitled “May
Fair,” published in 1827, while making no
direct reference to hansoms, contains the lines:
There beauty half her glory veils
In cabs, those gondolas on wheels.

Are any Australian lizards venomous ? —4097.
No; but many have sharp teeth set in strong
jaws, and, as they feed on decaying things, a
bite may convey poison to the blood of the
victim. Mostly, however, they are harmless,
and useful as insect destroyers.
* * * *
What is the opinion of the N.S.W. Local
Government Department as to the desirability
of a town clerk buying land in the municipality
of which he is an officer? —4071.
The department’s view is that a town clerk is
in a particularly favored position, having know-
ledge of values of land in the council’s books
and of localities in which the council proposes
to expend its funds. This information would
not be possessed by the ordinary citizen. More-
over, a town clerk may be asked to submit a
recommendation as to what lands should be
placed in the hands of the Public Trustee for
sale, and would be in a position to recommend
the sale of land which he desired to purchase.
The department considers it is not desirable
that a town clerk should purchase land in re-
spect of which he has official dealings.
* * * *
What is the meaning of the term “Third Re-
public” ? —4105.
It is the Republic that has existed in France
since 1870. The First Republic was set up at
the Revolution and overthrown by Napoleon;
the second, set up in 1848, was overthrown by
Napoleon 111., who made himself Emperor (the
Second Empire), in 1852. After the defeat of
the French in the Franco-Prussian War the
Second Empire collapsed, and the present Re-
public was established.

Explain the references Bahram, Rustum and
Hatim Tai in Omar Khayyam ? —4049.
Bahram Gur was a fabled Sassanian sovereign,
who, according to Persian legend, built seven
towers or castles, each of a different color and
representative of the seven heavens, each being
inhabited by a Royal concubine. He was said
to have sunk into a swamp while engaged in
his favorite sport of hunting the wild ass.
Rustum was the fabled hero, the Hercules of
Persia, whose exploits are celebrated in the
Shah-nama. Hatim Tai is a well-known type
of Oriental generosity.
* * * *
Who was Fiona Macleod? —4044.
This was the pen-name adopted by William
Sharp, poet, novelist and critic, for the publi-
cation of his Celtic romantic tales. The secret
was not revealed until after his death. Sharp
was born on September 12, 1856, at Paisley,
Scotland, and educated at Glasgow University.
After a few years as a bank clerk in London he
devoted himself from 1881 onwards entirely to
literature. He died on December 14, 1905.
* * * *
Who was the founder of algebra, Descartes or
Omar Khayyam ? Give a brief history. —4o4s.
Neither. A rudimentary form of algebra was
in use in Egypt as far back as 1700 b.c. In the
fourth century a.d. Diophantus of Alexandria,
in his Arithmetica, presented some methods of
simplifying calculation which are still in use;
they constitute the first Western contribution.
The science over a long period was developed
exclusively by the Arabs and Hindus; Omar
Khayyam (eleventh century) devoted several
books to it. In its Western development im-
portant names are those of Lucas Paciolus
(fifteenth century), Vieta of France (1540-1603)
—the first to use letters for all quantities, known
and unknown —Harriot in England (1631) and
Girard in Holland (1629). Rene Descartes
(1596-1650), the French philosopher and mathe-
matician, applied algebra to geometry, and
invented the “Cartesian co-ordinates.”

Some particulars of the life of Coleridge-
Taylor, composer. —3963.
Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, of mixed Anglo-
African descent, his father, a medico, being a
native of Sierra Leone, was born in London,
August 15, 1875. He studied at the Royal
College of Music. His first successful, and per-
haps best-known, musical composition was the
choral-orchestral work “Scenes from the Song of
Hiawatha” (1898). Other important works in-
cluded “The Blind Girl of Castel-Guille, The
Atonement” and music to several plays ot
Stephen Phillips. He also wrote numerous
songs and a quantity of attractive pianoforte
music. He died September 1, 1912.
* * *
(1) Was Debussy a great pianist? (2) Are
any of his pianoforte works easy? —4o4B.
(1) His technical equipment was excellent,
and in his younger days he was engaged to illus-
trate lectures on Wagner with pianoforte ar-
rangements of that composer’s operatic works,
which he played in a masterly fashion. (2) No.
Even the “Children’s Corner” suite and the
simplest-seeming of the “Preludes” present con-
siderable difficulties, chief of these being re-
pression of the percussive effect of the piano-
forte hammers and meticulous attention to
pedalling to ensure the correct mixing of har-
monic colors.
* * * *
Are there any cases on record where a com-
poser of opera has produced one great popular
success and not been heard of again? —4052.
Probably not, since a great success always
brings with it a demand for further works.
But there are many operatic composers whose
reputation hangs on one achievement, such as
Mascagni (“Cavalleria Rusticana ), Leon-
cavallo (“Pagliacci”), . Boito ( Mefistofele ),
Vincent Wallace (“Mantana”) and Balfe ( Bo-
hemian Girl”). To come nearer the present
day, Gustave Kerker produced nothing of note
after “The Belle of New York,” and Frederic
Norton is still remembered only as the writer
of the music for the phenomenally successful
“Chu-Chin-Chow.”
Brief Answers.
J.L.S.: Write A. E. Smith, 9 Hunter-street,
Sydney T.W.D.: Carkinguginup is a W.A.

Candidates for the N.S.W. Travelling .Art
Scholarship must lodge application on prescribed
form, accompanied by birth certificate, not later
than December 31, 1936, with F. Hutchins,
secretary, Travelling Art Scholarship Commit-
tee, Department of Education, Sydney....
G.W.: (1) Yes. (2) Can be obtained by a
chemist from Burroughs, Wellcome and Co.
(3) Yes J.C.; Sterilisation is illegal, and no
“clinic” actively practising it exists in Sydney.
There are, however, various unofficial bodies
which recommend the operation (especially for
persons suffering from incurable mental
diseases) as a safeguard against racial deteriora-
tion. The matter has not gone beyond the
stage of advocacy... .TJ.T.: There are no
alligators in Australia or Papua. These saurians
are restricted to America and China, there being
only one species known to China. There are
two species of crocodile in North Australia, a
small fresh-water one and a large salt-water or
estuarine one. The latter is widely distributed in
Papua and neighboring islands, and is often,
though quite wrongly, referred to as an alligator.
A.M.D.: Gargle the mouth and throat three
times daily, or whenever the craving for tobacco
becomes urgent, with a solution of nitrate of
silver (1 p.c.). Do not allow the solution to
moisten handkerchiefs, etc., as it causes black
stains. The desire to smoke may also be les-
sened by eating sweets, but will-power is the
most important factor G.H.H.: With 10
horses in each of two races the possible number
of doubles.is 100. £4 19s. to Is. are the mathe-
matical od'ds L.R.; Some materials become
shiny more quickly than others, and even after
treatment soon become shiny again. The cure
is steaming, either by holding the affected parts
over a basin of steaming water (kept boiling)
or in front of a kettle spout; the nap of the
cloth is then brushed up a little with a wire
brush. Damping with a very hot damp cloth
is also effective as a preliminnary to brushing.
H.R.M.: (1) Yes. (2) Yes, if a good-quality
blueing solution is used. (3) Parker’s Blueing
Solution, price 12s. 6d., postage 9d. (instruc-
tions enclosed), will be found satisfactory; or
the gun may be reblued by a gunsmith (cost
about 17s. 6d.). (4) From Sil Rohu, 143 Eliza-
beth-street, Sydney... .A.G.: Sir Henry
Lytton’s Secrets of a Savoyard was published at
7s. 6d., but is probably now out of print. A
bookseller may be able to obtain it for you.
~.. J.H.: A member of the A.I.F. who was in
camp in Australia but who did not embark for
service overseas is not considered to be a returned
soldier within the meaning of the Returned
Soldiers and Sailors’ Employment Act, and is,
therefore, not eligible for preference under that
Act, or under the Local Government Act as
amended by Act No. 39 of 1935... .W. 8.: The
last male Tasmanian aboriginal, Billy Lannee,
died in 1865, and the last woman, Truganina, in
1876 A.A.: (1) The referee’s decision was
correct, as the rules state that in the event of
the judges disagreeing in a boxing contest the
final decision rests with the referee. (2) No
other decision could have been arrived at. (3)
Professional contests in Australia are judged
by a referee only, and he awards points for
each round. He has no assistants J. 8.: (1)
The officer is within his rights in exercising a
discretion as to the information to be supplied.
(2) Legislation is provided in the one case but
not in the other. Your grievance is against
the legislators. (3) You should report it to the
police, who, if the evidence is sufficient to war-
rant action, might take proceedings under the
Gaming Act. (4) A question of discipline for
the postmaster to deal with. (5) Refer to the
Department of Labor and Industry, Sydney....
L.W.: Write the Pharmacy Board of N.S.W.,
Science House, 157 Gloucester-street, Sydney.
. ...A.J.; The Dividing Fences Act (N.S.W.)
provides for the requisition to come from the
“owner” or person “legally possessed of the
land.” It also provides that where any dispute
arises between parties as to the necessity for or
sufficiency of a dividing fence it may be referred
to two persons to be mutually chosen, and, fail-
ing agreement between them, to an umpire
whose decision shall be final... ,M J.: The con-
dition is to some extent constitutional, but
development is helped by a regular course of
deep-breathing and other exercises designed to
improve shoulder and chest measurements.
Physical culture experts also recommend mas-
sage and the drinking of milk and cream....
W.L.J.F.: (1) Consult a nose-and-throat special-
ist, who will arrange suitable treatment at no
cost to yourself. (2) Address posted A. 8.:
Soak in cool water for a while, then gradually
raise the temperature of the water until it is as
hot as can be conveniently borne by the hand.
If the stain will not rub out during the heating
of the water, try some ammonia in the water
and rub with that. If still obstinate, try rub-
bing with oil of eucalyptus on a flannel
F.E.: E. Esdaile and Sons, 42 Hunter-street,
Sydney E.W.R.: The secretary of the Legion
of Frontiersmen in Sycfney is Captain K.
Knott, 105 Pitt-street... .L.M.: (1) Possibly a
deficiency in the total amounts of the body
fluids, which hold sodium chloride in solution.
(2) Unlikely to have any harmful effect. (3)
Impossible to give an opinion without examina-
tion HJ.M.W.: Particulars too long to re-
print. See p. 256 Johns’s Australian Biographical
Dictionary... .C. R.L.: “Sturm und drang” is a
German phrase meaning storm and stress. It
was applied to a literary movement in Germany
about 1770-90 which represented an outburst
against literary and social convention M.N.:
The suggestion of the Oxford Dictionary is that
the name Billy for the male goat was applied as
appropriate to its sex, billygoat being analogous
to tomcat J.E.H.: Yes, but the Pensions
Department may, in the circumstances, put in a
claim (Many others mailed.)

“Ron J.”:, Railway traffic was recently
held up at Milvale (N.S.W.) because the

Pioneer Families
Unless you are satiated with praise, we
of Rawdon Vale should like you to
accept our quota for your policy of
encouraging Australian writers to write
on Australian subjects. We sincerely
hope that you will long continue this
policy.
We were all very interested in All That
Swagger, and in I Sold My Horses also.
The history of the Delacy family is strik-
ingly like that of the Laurie family,
allowing for the difference of Irish and
Scotch ancestry.
The original Laurie arrived in Aus-
tralia in 1841 and settled here in 1848.
The family went through much the same
experience as the Delacys: bank smash
in 1848 ; the gold fever of 1851-52 ; the
rush for land in the ’sixties; the coming
of the free selectors; bank failures in
’93 ; floods, fires, drought; finally the
Great War, wherein 26 members of the
Laurie family took part. Several left their
bones in France and elsewhere. And now
the youngest generation is going in for
aviation—the family has one fully-quali-
fied pilot.
You will see from these facts how true
All That Swagger is of our pioneer fami-
lies. We trust such stories will so popu-
larise life in the country that, instead of
the drift to the cities, there will be a
drift to the country. lam afraid that
our so-called politicians will never do
much for such a movement.—A. B. H.
(Rawdon Vale, via Gloucester, N.S.W.).
Australians Last
Ten thousand Australians are em-
ployed in companies writing fire and
marine insurance. It is improbable that
many of them will vote Yes at the
marketing referendum.
The Dairy Produce Control Board re-
cently arranged in London for the plac-
ing of marine insurance, including fire
risk before shipment, on all the butter
to be exported from Australia for three
years, thus depriving Australian cos. of
approximately £30,000 in annual pre-
miums.
Practically all the business in frozen
meat and most of that in wheat con-
signed overseas has been lost to Aus-
tralian insurance companies through the
cheaper rates offering in London. Repre-
sentatives of Lloyds have been sent to
“Cripes, Ma, I dunno w'ether t ’ kill Nellie after all —she looks good
fer another egg.”
Australia to make direct contact with
those who have insurances to place.
Wheat exporters freely availed them-
selves of cover in London at cut rates,
notwithstanding the fact that the indus-
try has in seven years benefited to
the extent of more than £14,000,000, to
which those engaged in insurance have
contributed. —F. W. K. (Vic.).
Growth of Pensions
At the end of November, 1934, there

N.S.W. Railway Finance
T. J. Hartigan, the N.S.W. Commis-
sioner for Railways, has been telling us
again that “the railway deficit was
£4,560,000 in 1931-32 and was reduced
to £698,000 in 1935-36.” The plain Eng-
lish of it is that' the admitted annual
loss was £4,560,000 in the first year and
£698,000 in the second.
According to Mr. Hartigan “the rail-
ways actually made a profit, and if the
capital had been subscribed as for a
public company the profit would have
enabled us to pay shareholders £3 11s. 6d.
per cent.” But a public company
wouldn’t have got £BOO,OOO of tax-
money as a gift and the use of a million
or two of loan money free of interest,
as the department did. It would have
had to pay taxes and make a substantial
allowance for depreciation. The depart-
ment never pays or allows a penny. —

Germany, Japan and Russia
According to the newspapers, British
Ministers were “surprised” at the agree-
ment between Germany and Japan. Mr.
Eden and his offsiders have been sur-
prised so often by European moves that
they should be getting used to it.
Still, the knowledge that the agree-
ment envisages support of Japan in Man-
chukuo and of Italy in Abyssinia seems
to have given them some feeling of dis-
comfort, though it has moved them to
“stiffen their determination not to be
drawn into any bloc against the Soviet
Union.”
Nobody with a grain of commonsense
wishes to see Britain or the Dominions
in any bloc against anybody. But it
would be a tragedy if in avoiding a sym-
pathetic understanding with powers which
should be natural friends —civilised
countries with civilised ideas whose in-
ventiveness and commercial enterprise
adds yearly to the world’s resources—the
British Commonwealth should find itself
bound to support Russia, which,every-
body distrusts and whose propaganda is
excluded from Australia under the
Crimes Act.
Come to think of it, outside Whitehall
there is something of a British Common-
wealth bloc against Russia. — Chiao-

THE YOUTH
COMPETITIONS
‘"THE BULLETIN” has received abundance of evidence that
1 its competitions for youths who want to get on but see no
present prospect of realising their ambitions are appreciated.
In one case the prize will amount to the sum of Fifty Pounds
(£5O), which will be paid by The Bulletin Newspaper Company,
at its discretion, to further the winner’s advancement in the
study, business or calling of his choice.
In the other case the prize will be a literary cadetship; in
other words, a job on “The Bulletin.”
“The Bulletin is to be congratulated,” said
Mr. A. A. Dunstan, the Premier of Victoria,
“In addition to providing one meritorious
boy with a position and another with a cash
prize, the competitions will have the important
result of helping to focus public opinion on the
parlous plight of many lads who, through no
fault of their own, have been unable to secure
employment.
“At a time like the present,” Mr. Dunstan
added, “movements such as those initiated by
The Bulletin deserve the fullest appreciation
of the community.”
“Cadetships on metropolitan papers are diffi-
cult to obtain,” said Mr. S. E. Pratt, general
secretary of the Australian Journalists’ Associa-
tion. “Youths seeking openings in the pro-
fession have realised this after their names have
been added to successive waiting lists.
“The Bulletin’s offer provides an excellent
opportunity for the boy showing the most apti-
tude. He will enter the profession through an
Australian paper held in high regard by experi-
enced journalists.”
Competitors for the £5O prize may be any
age from 17 to 22. They will be required to
give in writing plain accounts of themselves,
their circumstances and aspirations, and the £5O
will go to the youth who, considered as a
citizen in the making, will, in the editor’s judg-
ment, put it to the best use.
He may be a student stumped for books or
fees; a budding scientist who cannot at present
buy needed apparatus; a lad with a mechanical
bent who is short of money for tools or for a
premium; an embryo flying or wireless man
who cannot finance a course; a young fellow
starting in some carrying or other business to
whom £5O would be a godsend; a country lad
who with £5O could do something in the share-
farming line or buy some implement or even
pay a deposit on a bit of land, perhaps having
some friendly neighbor who may be willing to
give a lad a chance.
The Bulletin wants the stories of such lads,
and of hundreds of others. Not necessarily
for publication in every case —no doubt in
some cases there will be written things which
should not be made public—but so that, it may
arrive at a fair judgment, and also that it may
collect evidence that will second the efforts of
those good people who have taken up the cause
of unemployed lads and of others whose oppor-
tunities have been tragically restricted by the
depression.
It will not be expected of any entrant for
Youth Competition No. 1 that he must be a
practised writer. If he makes out what is
adjudged the best claim to the £5O it won’t
matter a bit if his grammar is rocky and he
can’t spell.
Character, courage and a clear and logical
purpose—these are the things that will tell.
In the other competition, however, literary
merit or aptitude will necessarily be a deciding
factor.
The Bulletin wants a lad who may be
trained to become a responsible member of its
staff, and naturally preference will go to the
boy who, on the evidence of the writing sub-
mitted, will seem most likely to supply the
requirements.
Youth Competition No. 1 is open to youths
in the 17-22 age group living anywhere in the
Australian Commonwealth or Territories or in
New Zealand.
Youth Competition No. 2 is also for lads
living anywhere in Australia or its Territories
or New Zealand, but they must be aged 17, 18
or 19.
In each case youths living remote from
Sydney will start equal with residents of Sydney
as regards chances of landing the prize.
If the winner of Youth Competition No. 2
happens to be a Victorian, a Queenslander, a
South Australian, a Westralian, a Tasmanian, a
New Zealander or a resident of any of the Aus-
tralian Territories, or of N. S. Wales beyond
Sydney, The Bulletin Newspaper Co. will pay
his fare to Sydney and see that he is installed
in a decent home.
If, after a fair trial, he does not like the job
or the job does not like him, he will be sent
back to the place he came from at the expense
of The Bulletin Newspaper Company.
Throughout The Bulletin’s history many
members of its staff have been brought from
parts of Australia other than N.S.W., and from
Maoriland.
James Edmond came to The Bulletin from
Queensland, S. H. Prior from Broken Hill
(then virtually part of S.A.) and the present
editor from Westralia.
AJ.A. (Australian Journalists’ Association)
rates for cadets are £2 a week the first year,
£2 15s. the second year and £3 15s. the third
year; then the cadet qualifies as a junior at
£6 12s. 6d.
If the editor’s choice falls on a stranger to
Sydney, the first year’s salary will be made up
to £2 10s., and the lad will have opportunities
of earning more. This will apply also to the
second and third years of his cadetship.
Entries for both competitions will be re-
ceived to the end of February.

quite in order to use large-size dry cells
such as the Ever-Ready C or Im-
pex 6/60 for the filaments. Al-
though the full filament voltage is
rated at two, which is obtainable by
using two cells in series (three volts) with
a series resistance to drop to two volts, it
is possible to run such a receiver success-
fully at 1{ volts in some circumstances.
Whether the receiver will function satis-
factorily or not depends on the circuit
design. If a single 14-volt cell will pro-
vide enough potential to operate the
valves satisfactorily, two or three such
cells connected in parallel will give good
service for a few months.
As well as the dry cell for filaments,
there is available the excellent wet form
of primary cell typified in the Carboncell
(Amplion A / sia, Ltd.), and more recently
in the new Air Cell handled by Ever-
Ready. The Carboncell gives a voltage of
14, similarly to the dry cell, but one
charge of electrolyte lasts approximately
a year. At the end of the discharge
period (when the zinc is eaten away) a
new zinc can be fitted, a fresh charge
placed in the container and the period
repeated. The carbon element is practi-
cally everlasting.
The new Air Cell is designed to over-
come the voltage difference in the usual
primary cell. This takes an electrolyte
charge similarly to the wet primary cell,
but the cell delivers a little over two
volts, not \\. It is new to Australia, but
has been in use for some years in U.S.A.
Most entirely-battery-powered receivers
in the U.S.A. use the Air Cell.
The Air Cell is not rechargeable, and
at the end of the discharge period an-
other must be purchased. Even so, the
outlay amply compensates for the incon-
venience likely to be encountered in
charging accumulators, and the fact that
the cell gives a little over two volts makes
it particularly attractive.
Readers interested in such cells can
obtain information from the two cos.
concerned. Both types will provide
steady voltage for modern battery re-
ceivers up to five valves.
D. B. K.
A Twin-valve Appliacation.
Twin-battery valves of the Class-B
type have many uses. For instance, in
the Little Twin receiver one triode sec-
tion served as a regenerative detector
and the other as an audio amplifier.
Illustrated is another useful idea, put
forward by a correspondent in “English
A Class-B valve of the 19 type can be
used in this arrangement.
Mechanics.” In it two grids are linked,
and one plate is used as a straight de-
tector, with the other as a separate re-
generator.
To obtain smooth oscillation control
the voltage on the regenerator plate
should be quite low, without failure of
oscillation. If it is not' desired to use
separate high voltage taps to the B bat-
tery a resistance of 50,000 ohms can be
included between the R.F. choke and B
positive, to drop voltage to around 45
volts. A Class B valve used thus can be
followed by the conventional audio
amplifier; the advantage of the separate
regeneration feature is that detuning on
short waves will be considerably re-
duced and oscillation control auieter
and smoother.
BATTERY SETS.
AUTOMATIC BIASING.
There is no doubt that the small bat-
tery receiver will be useful particularly
for short-wave experimenting for a
long time to come. With a combination
of only two or three valves remarkably
efficient performance can be obtained,
mostly by headphones, but not infre-
quently by loudspeaker. Such small re-
ceivers are to be found to-day only in the
home-constructor class. As a commercial
production they are rare in this country,
but it is unlikely that such receivers will
die completely out, because the amateur
craftsman is always recurring. Apart
from those people who must of necessity
use batteries. entirely for power supply,
there are others, amateur transmitters
included, who prefer a battery-powered
receiver even in an A.C. location, because
of the relatively silent operation, free
from line noises.
In many cases such receivers are built
up with the popular 6.3-volt indirectly
Fig. 1. —The principle of automatic grid
bias applied to a directly-heated valve.
heated valves, because of the ready pro-
vision for automatic grid biasing afforded
by the separate cathode. The indirectly
heated valves have this advantage, along
with others, but biasing alone is no
reason why the particularly economical
directly heated types of valves should
be passed over. If the C bias battery is
looked upon as an unnecessary addition
there is no reason why auto-bias should
not be applied, as with indirectly heated
valves. Automatic bias for directly
heated valves involves no more compli-
cation, and is easily provided for.
Reference to Fig. 1 shows the general
method. Here is illustrated an audio
valve preceded by an audio transformer.
Normally the C negative connection from
the secondary of the transformer would
connect to the appropriate negative
voltage tap on a bias battery, with the
positive terminal of the;battery going to
A negative. In- the circuit the secondary
connection is taken direct to B negative.
Yet the valve grid is biased negatively,
because a resistance is inserted between
B negative and A negative. To consider
the action, the B negative end of the B
battery must be taken as being the lowest
point of potential. The highest point is
naturally the B positive. There must be
a progressive voltage drop between B
positive and negative, and the path of
current can be considered as being from
B positive through the valve and the bias
resistance to B negative. Current flows
through the bias resistance, and the
Fig. 2. —Automatic biasing for two audio
stages with directly-heated valves. A
single-tapped resistor can be used.
amount depends on the needs of the par-
ticular valve, There will be a voltage
drop across the resistance. It is import-
ant to note that the A negative end of the
bias resistance is more negative than the
B negative end. It will be seen that the
filament is connected to the end of the
resistance that is at a lower potential
than the end connected to the trans-
former secondary and B negative. There
is a slight loss in plate potential for the
valve to the extent of the amount of
voltage gained for grid bias, but this
is not detrimental.
Such automatic biasing is most applic-
able to sets using small-power valves and
pentodes, as quite a small grid bias
voltage, usually between 6v. and 9v., is
wanted for these valves. With large-
power valves in a receiver run from
super-power batteries, the auto-bias
method is not quite so attractive, as pos-
sibly 20 volts or more is needed for bias.
It then becomes a waste to use an ap-
preciable part of big batteries for a job
that is done normally by an effective and
comparatively inexpensive bias battery.
It is quite possible to bias automatically
two stages of audio amplification, and this
procedure may be worth while for some
sets.
Usually the first audio stage needs only
a small bias, and this can be obtained
by tapping on the bias resistance in the
power stage. Fig. 2 shows how this is
done, and the example provides for an
assumed bias on the first stage
and seven volts’ bias on the output,
lmfd. or 2mfd. condensers are connected
across the bias resistors as a safeguard
against instability.
Where two audio stages are automati-
cally biased thus, it is essential to ade-
quately decouple the R.F. stages (if any)
in the receiver. One great advantage of
auto-bias is that the usual trouble of
an over-biased valve, which follows from
a running-down B battery used with a
grid-bias battery that is still up to full
voltage, is avoided. As the high-tension
voltage decreases, the plate current
through the audio valve (or valves), and
consequently through the bias resistance,
decreases also. Thus the voltage drop is
decreased and the grid bias is automati-
cally cut down.
D. B. K.
Tuned R.F. Advantages.
At one time controversy regarding the
relative virtues of tuned R.F. receivers
and superhets was rife in Australian
radio circles; the argument centred
mainly in the receiver intended for no
other use than the 200m.-550m. broad-
cast band. The ousting of the tuned
R.F. receiver was the outcome of the
need on that band for greater selectivity
than such a receiver normally can give ;
otherwise the receiver had much in its
favor. For all- wave reception, taking in-
continuous coverage from below 10m. up
to a few thousand metres, the straight
tuned R.F. has undoubted points as a
communications receiver. A good ex-
ample is provided by the receivers used
on the Nazi Zeppelin Hindenburg. In
principle these are nothing more than
the once-popular “R.F., detector and
two audio.” For the wave-changing,
coils are merely switched into circuit by
the rotation of drums carrying R.F. and
detector coils, and when working on
higher or lower frequency extremes
extra tuning capacities are automatically
cut in or out as needed.
Illustrated is a U.S.A. example of a
modern T.R.F. receiver; a product of
the Sargent Co., of Oakland, California.

from 9.5 m. to 20,000 m. The co. says:
“It takes a T.R.F. set, with its lack of
tube noise, to get those really weak
signals from distances not commonly
heard on larger receivers.” The coil
unit under the chassis, covering 9.5 m.
to 3750 m., has individual stage shields,
and the entire unit is spaced -f-in. off
the chassis, confining coil currents to the
unit itself. The coil unit above the
chassis, 3750 m. to 20,000 m., is of similar
construction. R.F. and detector valve
bases and associated parts are shielded
from the rest of the receiver by the
coil unit, with all circuits isolated. Well-

The terms —Indigestion and Dyspepsia
—simply mean illness of the digestive
organ, and apply to a group of
symptoms which accompany every
disease of the digestive system.
The cause °; r v,: a d tin o;
irregular eating, improperly prepared
and unsuitable food, overwork (mental
or physical) irritants (such as tea,
coffee or alcohol) in excess.
The EFFECTS:
originating from a disordered stomach.
Food not digested, constipation, lack
of nutrition, blood impoverished,
poisons absorbed into the system, and
other organs so affected they cannot
perform their work.
The RESULT:
becomes tired, muscular system
weakened, insomnia, excessive debility,
bad blood, skin blemishes, low vitality
and susceptibility to serious disease.
The REMEDY: j- 1 -:
the use of Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive
Tabules, which digest what you eat,
relieving the inflammation of the
mucous membranes lining the stomach,
protecting the nerves and enabling the
glands to secrete the natural juices of
digestion.

The remarkable medical history
of Billy, 10-years-old son of Mr.
and Mrs. Bott, of Leichhardt, has
amazed every one of the neighbors
who have known him since he
fell 90ft. from a railway bridge
five years ago.
Interviewed at home, Mr. and
Mrs. Bott gladly and freely gave
permission for Billy’s story to
be told to the world for the sake
of other parents, whose children
might be benefited by the treat-
ment which, finally resulted in
Billy’s return to vigorous happy
boyhood,
Mr. Bott tells the story this way:
‘The school which Billy attended
was some distance from our
home. To reach it, he had to
cross the railway line at Lilyfield
by means of an overhead bridge
spanning a deep cutting.
Adventurous youngsters often
crawled under the fence and
played on the edge of the cut.
90 Feet Down! Down!
Down!
Billy did more—he climbed on to
the brink parapet of the bridge
and, leaning over, lost his balance
and fell sheer down to the railway
track 90ft. below. Providentially,
he id! in a patch of soft read.
We believe that this was the only
thing which saved his life.
This we learned afterwards, but
to continue. As my wife was
returning from a visit to town by
tram on the day Billy fell, an
ambulance passed, bell clanging,
and obviously in urgent haste.
Little my wife knew that Billy,
was the patient (his life ebbing
away) who was being so swiftly
rushed to expert aid. She. was
worried on her return home to
find Billy had not returned from
school, and her worry became in-
creased as time crept on. She
was nearly frantic with anxiety
by the time I arrived home at
6.30. There was only one thing
to do. I got in touch with the
police and found after many
inquiries that a boy answering
to Billy’s description had been
admitted to the Children’s
Hospital, but was not expected
to live the night.
Rush to Hospital
By car, my wife and I, rushed to
the hospital. It was our son!
Both his pelvic arches had been
fractured and there seemed little
hope for his recovery. He had
lain on the tracks until his white
Shirt had attracted the attention
of a signalman, who had dragged
him clear of the lines as a train
rushed under the bridge from
which he had fallen.
And there, he was at the hospital
—unable to recognise his mother
or me—a wee, small urchin of
five lying wan and white.
Fight for LLV
I can't, pay a high enough tribute
to the doctors and nurses who
pulled him through those first
desperate days when his life was
in the balance and who so bril-
liantly worked so. that Billy’s
terrible injuries would not leave
him a lifelong cripple.
Fifteen Weeks in Hospital
It was fifteen weeks before Billy
was discharged from the hospital
and we brought him home, with
thankfulness for the sparing of
his life.
Terrible Night Terrors
But we found that the shock to
his nervous system had beer
terrible. He was a sheer bundle
of nerves—he could not sleep a
night, or, if he did, he would fr
into a fitful slumber only t.
awake screaming from terrible
nightmares.
He was like this for nearly five
years. We did not know what to
do. Nothing seemed to give any
relief, and the strain on the boy
as well as on ourselves was
rapidly becoming unbearable. We
had tried almost everything when
we were recommended to try
Bidomak.
Miraculous Results from
BIDOMAK
We did so, not because we
thought it would really do any
good, but in hope that perhaps
it might. But I tell you, it was
a miracle Almost at once Billy
calmed down—he began to sleep
quietly and peacefully and his
night terrors left him.
In words it r- icult to make
you understand just how much
Bidomak has done for us. One
would need to have experienced
all I’ve told you to realise hdw
much Billy went through. But
he’s all right now. Just look at
him.” ■
We did, and to see that happy,
carefree fit youngster made us
proud to think that Bidomak had
wrought so wonderfully.
The story of Billy Bott, as we
have told it above, may be
verified in detail by anyone who
is interested. It was offered to
us by his parents without solicita-
tion and in gratitude for what
Bidomak had done. No payment
was made for permission to
publish the facts. Mr. and Mrs.
Bott will be content if their son’s
