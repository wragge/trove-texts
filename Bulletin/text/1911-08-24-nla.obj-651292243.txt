AUGUST.
A fat moon leers in the coppery sky,
And the fruit’s a-rot on the cabbage-
leaves ;
A thick Augean stable steam
From its blistered asphalt Holborn heaves
To the stars that are tired, on an air that is
sick;
And the water’s warm in the drinking-
trough.
How is it here in Hell? —Well, 'ot,
And the oldest .Rotten’un calls it tough.
For the tiles that look so cool to the eye
Would grill you holes in a hippo’s hide ;
And the great Unwashed, that has sworn off
soap,
Is lyric and loud in his noisome pride;
And the sawdust, spread for the leaky of lip,
Hops with a small, black, nimble plague,
Whose cannibal methods of waging war
Lack the imprimatur of The Hague;
And the huge coke cooking-fires that see
The seasons in, and the seasons out,
And never die, are a searing curse
That would make an Andaman Islander
shout;
And the fizzling bloater’s viscous smoke
Hangs, a blue net, our heads above,
And a million obscene, pest-drunk flies
Buzz in the acrid meshes thereof;
And .the tables’ litter, with spilth of grease,
The well-gnawed bone and the ill-gnawed
crust,
The stale tea-leaves and the spatters of
milk—
Knew Dante a circle called Disgust?...
How the sick gorge dreams of a far-back
day.
Of a green-bowered inn by' the Thames’
cool blue,
Of a cantaloup franne , a salmon trout,
And a bottle of Hock!
And that’s Hell. too.
W. A. Mackenzie, Rowton House Rhymes.
Out of the Depths
Since The Ballad of Reading; Gaol no book
of verse lias come out of England which has
been charged so fully with bitter personal
experience -as the Rowton House Rhymes of
William Andrew Mackenzie (Blackwood).
Wilde fell from a life of comfort and elegance
into disgrace and gaol. The drop to Row-
ton House, a night refuge of London, was
not so far, yet far enough to shake up a
sensitive man who had known better things.
Mackenzie does not state his own experi-
ences ; but the uncompromising vigor with
which he pictures phases of low life, and the
state of mind of the “dead-beat,” the hell 6:
Hunger and the elysium of Alcohol, imply
an acquaintance at first hand with the “doss’
and its frequenters. The author was as cer
tainly down as his culture shows that he had
previously been up.
The regular and some artificial forms of
verse are handled with ease. There is a
ballade of one who has secured a lodging for
the night:—
Here’s a bench by the Bridge and the peeler’s
away;
I lodge at the Sign of the Beautiful Star,
a pantoum for everybody, which begins :
Art is the game of an hour and a minute;
Love is a jest of a night or a day;
Life is a top and Death doth spin it;
Hunger and thirst are the things that
stay.
and a “Sestina of the Shuffling Feet” more
despairing than Lawson’s “Faces in the
Street”
"Fleeing yourself? Hood luck, mate!” says
the street.
at the joysome jig of dodging woe?
Lord. Ive seen generations come and go
Along my dingy length, and heard them beat
lhe hurried rhythm of flight with shuffling
feet.
Did ever one escape? Ido not know.
“God may. But old Despair must surely
know;
He s lurking round the corner,” laughs the
_ street.
With ‘what’s your game?’ to stay all sus-
pect feet,
And keep them marking time till up comes
Woe,
Despair s point-dutyman on Sorrow's beat,
lie swings the traffic hell-ward —down you
go!”
The poem called “Alcohol” should be read
and digested by temperance advocates, to
whom, also, “Bagster, French Polisher,” has
a word to say on behalf of Rum as a Fact
in a world of unrealities:—
BAGSTER DESCANTS:
Wot do I want? Fects, Fects. Nali,
Rum’s a feet;
Rum’s somethin’ solid in a wobbly world,
it s cheap. It’s there. It’s never fur aw’y.
It nips yer stummick. an’ it ’eats yer blood ;
Gives ye the notion that you’re still alive;
lips ye “Good-night, me lord, an’ pleasant
dreams!”
Mikes ye fergit that Luck ’as turned ye
dahn;
Mikes ye ferget yer pore ol’ woman’s stiff,
xer Jack’s a lifer, an’ yer Liz a ’ore.
Mikes ye fergit the d’ys w’en you was quite
Content to wu’lc to yet enough to eat — 1
l o ’ave the stren'th —like' all the other mugs.
Rum. Rum’s a feet!
That’s w’y you find me ’ere
Mos’ d’ys a-lappin of it up. A man
’As got to ’ave ’is Feet. Ruin's mine —wot’s
yours?
ALCOHOL.
For mistress you had fortune; I,
Fame with her lure and kibsely-knotted
zone;
And you, the wing-foot nymph whose name
is Art.
We gave them youth, we gave them hope and
heart,
For them we pledged our harvests yet un-
sown—
And they deceived us traitorously.
Drink’s now the hawd of us that weep
Our cheated past, our future spent ere won.
Her kiss is lowly priced. Forgetfulness
We have of her; and when her paid arms
press,
We are clutched into the brute oblivion
Of stertorous unliaunted sleep.
We do not bring her song of flowers;
We do not tremble when she deigns to smile,
Nor catch our breath should she decide to
frown ;
She is the common woman of the town :
Foul, faithful, free of smirk or painted wile,
She takes our silver, and is ours.
Sleep—one night’s sleep—profound, un-
stirred :
Nirvana after mons of despair;
Nepenthe after fever-rave and -rack;
A paradise where all i thank God !) is black ;
A silence deep as Tophet; and an air
Unbroken of any mocking bird ;
Such boons we beg on bended knees
From Heaven high as we are hell-deep low;
And what is Heaven's answer to our prayer V
Another blinding billow of despair,
Another clanging dawn ot hot-brained woe,
Another plague of memories.
Alcohol's kinder. So to red
Rum and to gin, the Circe virgin-white,
We turn —-to all the brands of stoppered
hell
Man brews to kill his ache intolerable,
Numb the raw rankle of the world’s barbed
slight,
And drown yon drumming in the head.
There's poison in her kiss? We know
There’s death within her cup? And do you
think
Death frights us, us? No—Life is what we
fear,
Life, the long journey, bitter and empty and
drear.
But in the fierce foul comradeship of Drink
We can, at least, in blindness go
Down the lone leagues and the sad slopes,
And over the interminable plain,
And, witting nothing, slide into the abyss
Where long have lain suake-Conscience with
her hiss,
And bludgeoned Faith, Love gashed and
slashed and slain,
And our dead youth, and our dead hopes.
“Comrades” states the ennobling power of
mateship, by which the souls of a harlot and
a thief are cleansed white as they beat up
the wind for judgment. The other extremity
—a rancid waster playing on a fellow-dere-
lict and squeezing him dry—is given in “My
Friend—Mr. Spunge,” which is, perhaps, the
most striking poem in a book of uncommon
power. There is little beauty, but there is
poetry in this book,, and it is poetry which,
like Galsworthy’s plays, will bring some ugly
realities home to people who would not other-
wise see them.
MY FRIEND—MR. SPtNGE.
He had a cough
As hollow as his hollow heart;
The wheeze was Nature, but the choke was
Art.
He said : “I knew you for a toff
First time I saw you.” Playing chess we
were,
And I was Blackburne’s master, Lasker's
equal,
And Lord knows all what else for sequel.
He played me soft as any dulcimer;
His touch
Was much
Like Pachmann’s, coaxing Chopin, no wild
clutch,
No brutal pound—he gentled me. •
He stirred among my various strings'
A zephyr in an aspen tree
That moves to song and at the same time
sings.
And Oh, the lungy way he spat!
And Oh, the cheesy sob .' —a thing to marvel
at.
* * * *
I gave my boots. I gave my shirt,
My coat I gave
•To hold this splash of London dirt
Back from the grave.
* * * *
Because I was joy whose name was Mud,
He sucked my blood.
Because 1 Would stay out and get the rain,
His task was easy and plain.
And if I 'choose to play Almighty God in
little
To him, the cringer, the lickspittle—
Well, then, I had to pay.
To that I’ve naught to‘say.
BUT —when, by some tongue-slip,
He learned my secret (all men have one), ■
And hawked it round the House for drinks—
My pain, my sorrow, for a pot of ale!—
I laid the whip
Of such hot scorn as the worm thinks
Must melt the hook, about the pale
And pasty head, and bade him run
Ere I had— o Lord, yes, he ran!
He ran
Just like —a man !
And as he sprinted he let fall a book.
“Marcus Aurelius,” you guess?
“Tristram of Lyonesse?”"
Or Omar’s wisdom? He had kissed the feet
Of all them, the cheat!
I picked it up and stole a book:
“Post Oliice Savings Bank” —his name.
I peeped inside, and felt no shame:
He’d £2B 13s. to his credit!
And so 1 knew the Thing—and I had fed It.
History as She is Wrote
The Clarendon Press, Oxford, issues a new
School History of England , by C. R. L.
Fletcher, with some verses by Kudyard Kip-
ling, and. pictures by Henry Ford. In less
than 250 pages the leading events are des-
cribed in a rough and ready fashion evi-
dently intended for junior classes. Fletcher
treats the big battles, and some of the most
picturesque events, very curtly. At times
he has a vivid phrase, as when he speaks of
Napoleon's army for the invasion of Eng-
land
If they had tried to get across unprotected
a single British warship could have pounded
them into red rice pudding in a few minutes.
Some of the later Sovereigns are summed up
tersely enough. George 11. was “a short,
ridiculous, red-faced person, with great goggle
eyes. ... He at least knew how to swear in
English, and he was rather too fond of swear-
ing.” George IV’. was “naturally clever, and
had some kind of selfish good-nature ; but he
was mean, cowardly, and an incredible liar.
He was succeeded in 1830 by a stupid,
honest old gentleman, his brother, William
IV., who as a young man had been named
‘Silly Billy.’ ” On the other hand, the late
Queen is called “Victoria the Great,” and is
ranked as one of the half-dozen greatest
“makers of England,” which is absurd.
The style would at any rate be welcomed
by kiddies after the formal duluess of most
school histories; but the fault of the book
is that it tries to explain things. Children
do not want the elements of Jingoism as
history-—they want a set of moving pictures
and a band ; the meaning of events can be
given in the senior classes.
An ideal history for children would present
the salient features of the past in a series
of short stories, somewhat as Kipling has
done in Puck of Poole’s Hill, and Rewards
and Fairies. Kipling’s contributions to this
history are not equal to the verses in those
books; but liis name will help considerably
in the sales. This is part of his version of
the story as told by the Thames: —
I w r alk my beat before London town,
Five hours up and seven down.
Up I go and I end my run
At Tide-end-town, which is Teddington.
Down I come with the mud in my hands
And plaster it over the Maplin Sands.
But I’d have you know that these waters of
mine
Were once a branch of the River Rhine,
When hundreds of miles to the East I went
And England was joined to the Continent.
I remember the bat-winged lizard-birds.
The Age of Ice and the mammoth herds,
And the giant tigers that stalked them down
Through Regent’s Park into Camden Town
And 1 remember like yesterday
The earliest Cockney who came my way,
When he pushed through the forest that lined
the Strand,
With paint on his face and a club in his
hand.
These are stanzas from another poem J
There are four good legs to my father's
chair—
Priest 'and People and Lords and Crown ;
I sit on all of ’em fair and square,
And that is the reason it. don’t break down.
When your time comes to sit in my chair,
Remember your father’s habits and rules,
Sit on all four legs, fair and square,
And never be tempted by one-legged stools
It is not often that a first book has the
fine qualities of The White Peacock, by D.
H. Lawrence (Dymock’s). The story is the
old one of two men and one girl. It is told
by the girl’s brother, but the way in which
the masculine beauty of the farmer’s son is
contrasted with the elegance of the wealthier
suitor says that D. 11. Lawrence is a lady.
The dialogue throughout is clever, and the
study of the principal girl is an excellent
one. She is attracted and repelled by the
rustic Hercules, who develops rapidly under
her influence ; but the other man gets her.
He too makes love in manly fashion, as wit-
ness this scene :—-
“Suppose now we were two angels?”
“Oh, dear —a sloppy angel!”
“Well, don’t interrupt me now —suppose
I were one—like the ‘Blessed Damosel?’”
“With a warm bosom!”
“Don’t be foolish, now —I a ‘Blessed
Damosel,’ and you kicking the brown beach
leaves below, thinking”
“Wl:at are you driving at?”
“Would you be thinking—thoughts like
pra v'-rs?”
“What on earth do you ask that for? Oh
—I think I’d be cursing, eh?”
“No —saying fragrant prayers—-that your
thin soul might mount up”——-
“riang thin souls, Lettie! I’m not one of
your souly sort. I can’t stand pre-Raphael-
ites. *You—you’re not a Burne-Jonesess —
you’re an Albert Moore. I think there’s
more in the warm touch of a soft body than
in a prayer. I’ll pray with kisses.”
“And when you can’t?”
“I’ll wait till prayer-time again. By Jove.
I’d rather feel my arms full of you; I’d
rather touch that red mouth—you grudger!
—than sing hymns with you in any heaven.”
“I'm afraid you’ll never sing hymns with
me in Heaven.”
“Well —I have you here —ves, I have you
now.”
“Our life is but a fading dawn?"
Liar ! Y\ ell, you called me ! Besides,
I don’t care; ‘Carpe diem,’ my rosebud, my
fawn. There’s a nice Carmen about a fawn.
‘Time to leave its. mother, and venture into
a warm embrace.’ Poor old Horace —I’ve
forgotten him.”
“Then poor old Horace.”
“Ha! Ha! —-Well, I shan’t forget you.
What’s that queer look in your eyes?”
"What is it?”
“Nay—you tell me. You are such a tease,
there’s no getting to the bottom of you.”
“You can fathom the depth of a kiss”
“I will—l will”
Some time ago the State of Missouri,
U.S.A., offered $lOOO for a song. Tlie prize
has been awarded to Mrs. L. C. Hull for the
following:—
Missouri, fair, we bring to thee
Hearts full of love and loyalty;
Thou central star, thou brightest gem,
Of all the brilliant diadem—
Missouri.
Chorus :
Then lift your voice and join the throng
That swells her praise in joyful song,
Till earth and sky reverberate:
Our own, our dear, our grand old State —
Missouri.
She came, a compromise, for peace;
Her prayer is still that strife may cease;
She mourned her blue, wept o’er her gray,
When, side by side, in death they lay—
Missouri.
Nor North, nor South, nor Bast, nor
West,
But part of each —of each the best.
Come, homeless one, come to her call;
Her arms are stretched to shelter all —
Missouri.
A, Bulletin correspondent at the University
of Missouri writes that “the Australian con-
tributors' efforts were pronounced by the
committee to be of high poetical value, but
their authors lacked the knowledge of local
conditions necessary for an acceptable inter-
pretation of Missouri ideals.”
The State now offers $5OO for a musical
setting of the prize song. The composer
should send his manuscript signed by a nom
de plume only, his full name and address
to go (with the nom de plume) in a separate
envelope. The competition closes on the 30th
November next, and MSS. should be sent to
Professor W. H. Pommer, University of Mis-
souri, Columbia, Miss.
At one time Albert Dorrington counted as
an artist in letters. That was before he left
Australia. Now his brilliant future is
definitely behind him; and he is finding his
level amongst the purveyors of cheap, sensa-
tional fiction in England. They are a hard-
driven Lot, for “speeders up” from America
make the pace hotter every year. Still, some
of them turn out yarns which arrest atten-
tion by ingenious plot or coherent adven-
ture. Our Lady of the Leopards \ Sydney
Book Club) is painfully disjointed and un-
convincing. The native princess of fabu-
lous wealth, who runs a menagerie and a
monkey-god in a lonely Indian valley, aided
only by a half-caste girl and. a Chow; the
showmen’s agents who want to annex the
god; the Irishman who filled the monkey-
god’s part at another place; and good old
“Bully” Hayes might have been made believ-
able with a little care. As it is, they do
not impose upon the reader for a moment;
the jadoo business by which the princess
executes her vengeance is ridiculous, and
Our Lady of the Leopards does not rise to
the level of an average “Deadwood Dick”
yarn.
While Dorrington is degenerating, G. B.
Lancaster is improving. The crudities of
her early stories, in which a girl strained
after the manly note, had almost disappeared
in Jim of the Ranges, and there are pas-
sages in that book which throw a scene or
action before the reader’s eyes as forcibly as
any in Kipling. Unfortunately, just as Miss
Lancaster was getting into the way of writ-
ing good Australian novels, she joined the
London contingent, and started to write about
England. In The Hon. Peggy (Constable)
there are phrases of the original quality.
The heroine says, when motoring through
avenues of beeches : “I feel as if I were being
perpetually poured down a green funnel.”
But here the action is not described so
much as reproduced, and it is more subtle
work than any in her previous novels
Peggy’s stepfather, the Colonel, had charge
of two young men—one brought up in Eng-
land as a gentleman, the other taken from
the gutter, and left to rough it in Canada-
and, before disposing of his fortune, he
wished to ascertain which was the better
man. He puts them to the test in a motor
trip through England and Wales and into
Scotland, each “claimant” taking his turn as
chauffeur. Peggy is thrown into the scale
too. and a very searching test is made.
The story is a good one, but it is over-
laden with an amazing amount of guide-
book information. This may be due to the
enthusiasm of the raw colonial for the storied
dust of Britain, and the bo r 'k is dedicated
“to all who wish to know and love the ‘open
roads’ of England.”

SANACINE prevents the wasting and tearing of the Tissues that occurs in violent colds,
clears away the congested phlegm, and speedily allays irritation and inflammation of the
respiratory organs, and strengthens the linings of the throat and nose. Colds, Influenza,
Lung Weakness, Head and Chest Colds, throat weakness and more virulent forms
of colds immediately yield to the vigorous curative action of Sanacine. A few doses
taken in the early stages diminish the severity of an attack, and a rapid cure is assured.

How French Women |
Develop
fshe . . .
The absence of a full,
well-rounded bust takes
away four-fifths of a
woman s charm.
Emaciation is really one
form of disease, and the
inability to add sufficient
tissue to round out and give to the
body a symmetrical appearance
is, in most cases, evidence that
some ailment is interfering with
the digestive and assimilative
processes.
How often have you watched
the tremendous social progress of
some of your female acquaint-
ances who, though not so fortu-
nate maybe as yourself in intel-
lectual attainments, but possess-
ing charm because of an excep-
tional figure, have carried all
before them.
As the magnet draws the steel,
so the influence created by a distinctive figure
attracts man.
Let two women enter a room together, both
strangers to the assembled guests ; let one be
as pretty as a picture in the face, thin and
slight-chested ; the other full-bosomed,
•V
/
well-rounded shoulders, hips developed pro-
portionately for height, and a full, rounded
(even though plain) face. Which receives
the admiration of the gathering ? She with
the pretty figure every time ! The pretty
face is a bad second.
You are not to blame for being thin ; but
if you remain thin, scrawny and undeveloped,
the blame rests entirely on your own shoulders.
Thousands of weak, nervous, run-down,
anaemic women who, when they
came to ns, were mere shadows
of what Nature intended them
to be, are now 7 , as the result of
a few weeks’ proper guidance,
perfect examples of female devel-
opment —healthy, strong and
permanently restored to vigorous
womanhood.
Send 2d. stamp, and let us tell
you, free of any cost, how you
may develop your bust. We
will also send you a FREE

“ It gives me great pleasure to inform you that I
have been completely cured of the Tobacco
Habit by your wonderful Tobacco Specific, after
using tobacco heavily for seven years, sometimes
Boz. to lOoz. in the week. It is now 12 months
since I last used tobacco, and, although I am con-
tinually in the company of smokers, I do not have
the least desire to smoke, therefore I consider
the cure permanent.
“My general health is now perfect; all my
former complaints, such as irregular Heart
Action, Dizziness, Nervousness and Stomach
Trouble, which I have every reason to believe
were caused through the use of tobacco, have en-
tirely disappeared, and are only remembered as a
hideous nightmare. I eat and sleep well, arid feel
fit to face the world again. It will give me great
pleasure to recommend your remedy to others.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ballad of His Lady’s Bays.
When I slip away from these sunlit places
And joy no more in the wind and the rain ;
When my eyes are shut to the dear loved faces,
And the dark draws down on my strife and pain ;
When I’ve done with losing and done with gain,
And am lost to the comforts that now stand nearest ;
When the dust is dead in my heart and brain,
I shall still be your glory and shame, my dearest.
When I’m cold to the night’s appealing graces
And deaf to old Ocean's grave refrain ;
When I laugh no more where the gladsome chase is,
But am hidden away in the vast Inane;
When all my desires and designs prove vain
And that star sets for ever that once shone clearest,
I shall hold you fast in a deathless chain. . . .
I shall still be your glory and shame, my dearest.
AVhen Hope from her record my name effaces,
And neither my deeds nor my dreams remain,
And I’m one with the rest of the hopeless cases
That stand in men’s minds as a fading stain ;
When your chance, grudged thought is my blight
and bane
And I’m weighed by sleek Folly (that judge
severest),
You shall be meshed in with my tangled skein. . . .
I shall still be your glory and shame, my dearest.
Mistress! however you fence or feign,
You know (and admit, when your mood’s sin-
cerest)
At the last I shall hold you tight-clasped again ;
I shall still be your glory and shame, my dearest.
MAORILAND.

Royals Three.
From sunlit vales of Arcadee '■
(A land where Love and Joy roam free),
Among the ships that cross the sea,
A ship is sailing straight to me
Under royals three, royals three,
Stuns’ls aloft and royals three.
My ship with melody is sweet
From ratlin taut to straining sheet,
From the swinging truck to the tinkling foam
That curls like lace on the green track home.
Her holds are filled with cargo rare,
Strong antidotes for pain and care,
And liquors rich to charm the blood
Of Avarice to generous flood.
She carries no specie in servile trust,
No dole for liars, no gems for lust,
No grist for the idler’s foolish mill—
For these no fairy royals fill.
But the toiler will see his work well done,
And the lover be glad beneath the sun.
And I’ll warrant that sorrow, and hunger, and sin
Will be no more when my ship comes in
Under royals three, royals three,
Stuns’ls aloft and royals three.
From the Leeuwin will flash the welcome word
That a ship like a snow-winged homing bird
Passed east on a day of gold and blue,
With a lading of love for me and you.
Under the stars that mocked my eyes,
That strove so long to pierce the skies,
AVhen my good ship comes safe to land
I’ll take my true love by the hand.
For stanch in halyard, brace and stay,
She’ll lift the Lonsdale light some day.
And I’ll warrant that hunger, and sorrow, and sin
Will be no more when my ship comes in.
I’ll load her heavy with human woe,
And down to Hades she may go,
And among the ships that cross the sea
She never more will sail for me
Under royals three, royals three,
Stuns’ls aloft and royals three.
VICTORIA.
HENRY TATE.
The Prodigal’s Psalm.
Drink deep ! Fill again, till your woes are forgot,
My brothers in misery! Why should we live
While the fire is unquenchcd and the worm dieth not,
When liquor can always oblivion give?
The gamut of passion is held in a flask—
From the gold of desire to the purple of pain !
And fair are the Hebes whom vine-wreaths enmask.
So, courage, my comrades! Fill up once again !
We are some of us last in the races of life ;
We are derelict some, weather-beaten and tossed;
And some are God’s warriors, downed in the strife;
But most of us gambled on Woman —and lost!
We swallow our gruel, for take it we must!
“What’s the good? Nothing matters!” is all our
refrain.
If the fruit of your life Ijas a kernel of dust,
You must moisten it more! Hearties, fill up
again!
The former-day friend one may happen to meet,
Who vacantly stares upon you and your woes
In non-recognition—it isn’t too sweet,
Or easily bearable, that, Heaven knows.
Cheer up ! Human nature’s a sordid affair,
Man’s friendship’s a difficult thing to maintain;
When status is judged by the coat that you wear,
Let friendship go hang! Hearties, fill up again !
If the lady you lost to your fancy appears,
Sigh no more! Devil knows there are women
enough !
No misty-eyed Niobe, dripping with tears,
Delilah is made of superior stuff!
And why should we trouble, the hopelessly damned,
Having nothing to lose and but little to gain?
If doors of the righteous before us are slammed,
Laugh louder, my friends, as your glasses you
drain!
There are times in the night when the curtain is
raised,
A flash of “what might have been” swiftly shot
back;
But lasses we loved and the liquors we praised
Have led us too far on the well-trodden track.
We know that it leads to the Land of the Lost;
We know it is littered with legions of slain!
Fill it up ! Fill again ! Never reckon the cost!
To oblivion drink! And then fill up again!

Neither side feels cheerful; but a doubtful Independent or two may throw in with the Labor party and enable it to carry on.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves ) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Bditor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

fused.

ENGLAND’S GREAT PERIL.
At the time of writing England is in the
act of emerging from the throes of
something that resembled civil war.
Blood has been freely shed, and men have
been slain in this revolt of (he working
classes against the “established” industrial
order. Various explanations have been of-
fered of the appalling and sudden outbreak.
The splendor of the Coronation ceremonies
may have had something to do with it. The
bald newspaper intimation that this senseless
mummery was responsible, one way and an-
other, for the expenditure of 40 millions
sterling (the precise sum, by the way, that
was lavished on Versailles, the monument
of royal extravagance which did so much to
expedite the French Revolution) would have
conveyed little to the poverty-stricken sec-
tion of Britain, had the crowd not been
forced to watch the vast sum being wasted,
as it were. For a little while, the people
who have everything in the world to make
life delightful paraded in view of the
millions whose existence is a ceaseless
struggle to sidestep hunger. The present-
ment of that gorgeous object-lesson in luxury
was surely bad tactics, from an administra-
tive standpoint. For years the underpaid
English worker and the famished out-of-
work have been accustomed to growl at the
disparity between their bleak lot, and that of
the nearest millionaire; but they went no
further. The British plutocrat, take him
for all in all, is about the most satisfactory
of his class extant. Possessed of a good
deal of public spirit, he does not, like the
Frenchmen of the old regime, boycott the
naval and military services of Ins native land,
and decline, to take a hand in its govern-
ment : lie shuns the sensational extrava-
gances of the rich American; he is less arro-
gant and snobbish than the German; and
he is more moral —in the sense that he takes
more pains to hide his immoralities —than
any of them. Because the “haves” in Eng-
land have forborne for many years past from
publicly obtruding their good fortune, and
because, further, they have mostly made
some effort, or pretence at an effort, to jus-
tify their existence by work, the “have nots”
have patiently endured them. Last month’s
carnival was a radical departure from the
rule of “good form” laid down by the im-
mortal Brummell, imposing on the well-bred
Briton the duty of making no vulgar display.
It must have driven home to the intelligence
of the dullest and least imaginative pauper
that its participants have not merely more,
but many thousand times more, than their
fair share. The presence of Andrew Fisher
would not have soothed the envious starv-
lings. In him the English working classes
saw a Prime Minister who had left Scotland
a pit-boy, and it is certain that they re-
marked that no such opportunities as he and
his colleagues had enjoyed lay in their way.
And then there is the educational factor.
The more Britain cultivates its masses, the
more it enlightens them on the grotesque
inequity of an arrangement whereunder 100
citizens spend their lives in penury, in order
that one man may amass more than he can
ever enjoy.
But all these things were necessarily mere
incidentals when weighed against the master-
fact that 25 per cent, of the nation is. star-
ving, while another 25 per cent, is so
hideously poor that life has no allurements to
offer them. Famine and dull, drab misery
have caused most of the popular revolts in
the world’s history, and there is enough of
both of them in England to account for the
horrors of the past week, without any addi-
tional factors. Freetrade politicians come
back to Australia, after a month or so spent
in the West End of London, and talk en-
thusiastically—as William McMillan, of
Sydney, did the other day—about “England,
the sun of the Empire’s firmament”; and
the humbug is cheered by the vacuous local
folks who make a hobby of Empire-leaguing.
A thinker of the McLinen type his
optimism on the fact that the United King-
dom is still in a large way of business as a
money-lender and investor. He does not
mention the “hunger-marchers” who have
taken to swooping down on the great cities ;
the tramps who have started to terrorise the
country parts; the city parks dotted with
human ruins ; and the crowded hovels, reek-
ing with dirt and squalor and disease, that
infest the pauper quarters of every city and
town. And, above all, the Freetrade apolo-
gist does not touch on the extraordinary
discontent which affects the classes that have
the luck to be in work. An English Labor
paper—and, strangely enough, it was a Free-
trade paper—advertised the fact, the other
day, that the average wage earned by arti-
sans in the United Kingdom amounted to
17s. 6d. per week. There must be
some plain reason why the British oper-
ative, once the most reliable and skilful
on earth, should be immeasurably worse paid
in his own country to-day than the same
class of worker is in Germany or France, not
to mention America and Australia. If he
has not grossly deteriorated it can only be
that his country’s industries can no longer
afford to pay him according to his deserts.
The dreary truth appears to be that the
British ivorker is not the man he was, nor
are British industries the live and effective
concerns they were; and both calamities are
due to the Freetrade insanity. British manu-
facturers might have little to fear from their
foreign rivals, given a fair deal. But, under a
system whereby the foreigner has his own
market reserved absolutely to himself, and,
in addition, has the British market as a rub-
bish-tip for his surplus products, they do not
get a fair deal, or anything resembling one.
The consumer in the United Kingdom has
for years been turning down locally-made
goods in favor of cheap imports. One effect
has been to vitiate a fourth of the nation.
There is nothing like enforced idleness to
sap decent men’s energy and vitality, and
transform them into wasters. The would-be
worker who finds himself persistently unem-
ployed, degenerates swiftly into an unem-
ployable, a class of which Britain already
holds a record number. Under the fiscal
system to which the Old Country clings, a
vicious circle is constantly being completed :
the factories, owing to foreign competition,
are employing fewer and fewer hands, and
the army of hopeless out-of-works is thereby
automatically swelled. A sort of side-tragedy
is that, while the Briton earns less than
ever he did, the mostly Trust-produced com-
modities from abroad, on which he has learned
to depend for sustenance, are increasing in
price. These are troubles calculated to
drive to revolt even those workers who are
getting what used to be considered good
wages.
* * * *
The peril that menaces Britain is hideously
obvious. It has delayed protecting its in-
dustries for so long that now it may be too
late. The sudden damming, by means of a
tariff, of the vast river of imports which
flows into the United Kingdom would prob-
ably mean national starvation. The work-
ing man, if his own fellow-countrymen are
to be believed, has so degenerated that it is
questionable if he could do the good work
he once did, even if Protection gave him the
chance. Also, the British capitalist has got
so used to investing his money in Australia,
the Argentine, Canada, the European Conti-
nent—anywhere rather than in England—•
that it is doubtful-if he would readily sub-
sidise home industries. Admitting that
Britain’s one hone —whichever way its
present trouble ends —of averting a revolu-
tion lies in providing employment at reason-
able wages for its out-of-works, its prospects
of salvation appear to rest on the construc-
tion of a bastard sort of Protective tariff
which will stimulate certain industries, while,
at the same time, it admits foodstuffs free.
’Phis would help the employers to pay the
living wages which, under Freetrade condi-
tions, they are unable to pay, though they
had all the good will in the world ; and a
living wage and plenty of it appears to be
Britain’s crying need just now. Further-
more, the outrageously rich —the West-
minsters, Portlands, and so forth, whose
incomes from rents alone rijn into hundreds
of thousands yearly —will doubtless have to
be taxed with a hand of iron. But these
things are all in the air. The pre-
sent dreadful positiou is that Britain
(even assuming that last week’s revolt
is effectually scotched) is in grave dan-
ger from writhin ; and at the same time Ger-
many, with a sizeable fleet, and a trained
army two millions strong is being as un-
pleasant as It knows how. One great naval
battle might cause the world’s greatest Em-
pire to crumble to pieces. It is a cheerless
thought for Australia, which has delayed de-
fending itself for a century, on the ground
that England was impregnable.
THE REFERENDA VOTE CONTINUES TO
COME HOME TO ROOST.
Towards the end of the Referenda campaign
Melbourne Age, which had shown itself a
strenuous pro-Trust advocate all through
the piece, wrote as follows: —
The only point at issue, says Mr. Hughes, is the
overthrow of the power of the Trusts, “which rule
here as they do in America.’’ This has been the cry
of the Labor party all through the campaign. It is
a hollow sham. We have no Trusts as in America.
And, about the same time, Sydney Tele-
graph cried indignantly:—
“Are the people to rule themselves?” That is the
fundamental issue. Let us see that it is not obscured
by handfuls of dust about Trusts and monopolies
that do not exist, and that show no sign of existing.
The electors appear to have believed these
mendacious statements, which were made
with great vehemence in every anti-Labor
newspaper, club and centre in the Common-
wealth. It is only last April that Australia
voted the way the local combines wished, and
already every household is feeling the effects.
Trusts, modelled slavishly on U.S. lines,
have sprung up everywhere, and those which
were already established have grown more
insolent than ever in their rapacity. It is
significant that the papers which a brief
four months ago argued in the name of
State Bights that the anti-Trust cry was a
sham, are, to-day, bitterest in their com-
plaints concerning the prevalence of Trusts
in Australia, and their peculiarly Yankee
methods of behavior. Thus the Age
(9/8/T1) wrote as follows :
We need, for our own consumption in Australia,
about 220,000 tons of sugar. We have not as yet
overtaken that amount of production, because of the
monopoly which bestrides the growers like a colossus,
cramping and crippling their operations. We im-
ported in 1909 about 99,000 tons of sugar, of the
value of £1,100,000. All that should have been
grown by ourselves, and it will be so as soon as the
industry can get released from the shackles under
which it struggles.
The same paper in the same issue had a
three-quarter column wail on the subject
of the “fruit monopoly,” which has secured,
in advance, “almost the whole of the ship-
ping space available for the carriage of Aus-
tralian fruit to Europe during the coming
season.” According to the paper which, last
April, described the Trust menace as “a
hollow sham” :
Fruit exporters will, in consequence of the forma-
tion of the Fruit Combine, be obliged to pay toll .
to this group in order to procure accommodation.
And it is not only in 1912 that the industry is to
be thus hampered. The shipping companies have
frankly notified the Minister that they intend to
continue the practice indefinitely of letting their
space to the ring, and they have positively declined
to do business with the Government.
Attempts were made for years in N. S.
Wales to form a timber ring. They all
failed till the other day, when the people’s
voice declared in favor of combines, so to
speak. Now, according to a recent issue of
the S. M. Herald:—
A close combination in the timber trade is prac-
tically assured.
The lines upon which the projected agreement will
run are the division of the trade among the mem-
bers of the combination, and the provision of penal-
ties for anv infringement of the agreement. Each
member will be allotted a certain proportion of the
trade, and it is expected that he will not exceed his
allotment. Should, however, it happen that he ex-
ceeds the limit awarded him, a penalty will be im-
posed upon him in proportion to the amount of his
excess business, and from the fund created by such
penalties recompense will be paid "to members whose
business does not reach their allotted proportions.
It is hoped by the negotiating parties that the
agreement will be concluded in time to put it into-
force by the beginning of May, and should these ex-
pectations' be fulfilled, retail prices of timber will
be raised by 10 to 20 per cent.
Fish rings exist in both N. S. Wales and
Victoria, a fact that, explains why fish, that
in this country, with its huge coast line and
its teeming waters, should be dirt cheap, is
actually available only as food for the well-
to-do. Victorian Minister for Agriculture
Graham remarked the other day :
The public has to pay very high prices for fish,
and yet the fishermen receive very little for their
hauls. I want to get at the bottom of the trouble,
and then try to remedy it. If the municipalities
will take over the control of the fish supply we will
be only too glad to let them have it. But the un-
satisfactory conditions of the past should not be
allowed to continue.
The mere fact that fishermen sometimes throw
away their hauls because they cannot get fair prices
for them, while fish continues dear in Melbourne,
is enough to show that a change in the existing
system is badly needed. So much fish was thrown
away in the bay in this way that a serious nuisance
was caused by dead fish being washed up on the
foreshores. The authorities actually had to inter-
vene and stop the practice. Now fishermen have to
go outside the Heads if they want to throw their
fish away.
N. S. Wales, with equal advantages, is
up against a similar trouble. Also there is
a Meat Trust, a Shinping Trust-, a Brick
Trust a Tobacco Trust, a Butter-Box
Trust, and various other organisations of
the kind, and their number is increasing
steadily. # #
Not even the folks who fought hardest for
a “No” vote on the Referenda questions
have the nerve to deny that the tendency is
inimical to the public welfare. As a result of
the Sugar monopoly’s arbitrary conduct in
the matter of price-raising (in the middle of
the recent strike it hoisted its charges for
raw and refined sugar by 20s. per ton —the
second advance within a fortnight), the man
in the street is called on to pay more, not
only for his household sugar, but for jams,
pickles, cakes, sweetstuffs and a thousand
other commodities. Brick and timber combines
have had as much to do with the poor man’s
difficulty in getting a dwelling of moder-
ate rental as the land boom has had. Bread
is dearer than it was, not because of Protec-
tion, nor yet because local crops have failed,
but owing to the fact that those in the busi-
ness have arrived at “honorable understand-
ings” to keep the nrice of this necessary
high. There is hardly any article of every-
day use that lias not gone up 20 or 30 per-
cent. in cost, owing chiefly to the machina-
tions of rings. Australia was as cheap a
place for the poor and “middle-class” man
to live in as Germany or France five years
ago; to-day it is almost as expensive for
these classes as America. And the fiercest
Tories are beginning to recognise that the
cause of the trouble is to be found in the
pervasion of the monopoly—that curse which
Lord Coke denounced three centuries back
as operating infallibly to “raise prices while
the commodity is not so good as before.”
Two reform-suggestions have come from
the political party which defeated the Fed-
eral Government’s proposals for dealing with
Australia’s Trusts. Sydney Telegraph.
being a severely anti-Socialistic sheet, voiced
the opinions of those who are opposed, at
any price, to State interference with pri-
vate enterprise, when it urged the public to
end the depredations of its gas, sugar aud
other vends by getting control of these con-
cerns in the ordinary way. Said the Tele-
graph blandly: “It is now open to anyone
to go into the market, and at the publicly
quoted price, buy shares.” Regarded as a so-
lution of the Trust trouble here, it is about
as satisfactory as,if the U.S. Government, in-
stead of prosecuting the Standard Oil Co..
counselled individual citizens of America to
go on Wall-street to try to buy out Rocke-
feller. Melbourne Age, throwing anti-
Socialism to the winds, advocates the for-
mation of Commonwealth Trusts as a means
of staying the voracious private enterprise
vends which are now robbing the Australian
consumer. In particular, that newspaper,
which last April did not believe that there
were any injurious Trusts in Australia,
called wildly last week for “the immediate
establishment of a national refinery as the
best method of opposition to the sugar mono-
poly.” That monopoly is a vast concern,
and one that will die hard. To establish a
Socialistic rival capable of pusting it from
its place of power would mean the expendi-
ture of a couple of millions. That expendi-
ture is quite unnecessary; and, anyhow,
under the Constitution, the Federal Govern-
ment has no power to go into the busi-
ness. The advocates of a Commonwealth re-
finery base their arguments as to the prac-
ticability of the scheme, on the enabling sec-
tion of the Constitution, which says: “The
Parliament shall, subject to this Constitu-
tion. have power to make laws for the peace,
order and good government of the Common-
wealth with resoect to trade and commerce
with other countries and among the States.”
This signifies, according to the Age, that the
Commonwealth Government may “for the
peace, order and good government of the
Commonwealth,” enter into business, at its
own discretion, as a sugar-refiner, and pre-
sumably also as a fish merchant, baker, tim-
ber-seller or what not. The absurdity of the
contention is as obvious as sin. The essence
of a Federal Constitution is that it allows
the national Government certain carefully
delimited powers, and reserves the residuum
to the States. “Peace, order and good gov-
ernment” are the admirable ideals which
every Administration is counselled to strive
after, and that is all there is to this section.
Andrew Fisher and his colleagues have no
more power under the Constitution, as it
stands, to launch out as sugar-refiners for
the- purpose of scotching private enterprise
concerns, however malign, than they have to
start Federal gaols on the plea that, in their
view, the State institutions are being in-
competently run. In any case, the appear-
ance of the Commonwealth in the field, in
opposition to each injurious Trust that man-
ifested itself would, in this couptry—where,
by the present look of things, there are soon
going to be hundreds of vends and combines
—be the costliest and insanest method o f
dealing with the evil. The cheapest and
most obvious method, on the other hand, is
that which the Federal Government pro-
posed last April, namely, that the Aus-
tralian Parliament should be empowered to
diagnose an injurious Trust on sight, re-
sume it at a fair price and run it for the
public benefit. Incidentally, this' is the only
possible means of ending the system _of
licensed robbery which is now scandalising
even the most Tory section of the com-
rrmnitv.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Blue Ruin that Refuses to Arrive.
When the Labor party took control of the
Commonwealth Government some 16 months
ago, there was one thing that the Tory press
and the Tory party were quite satisfied
about —there was going to be a complete
stoppage of industrial enterprise, and the
capitalist was going to gather his gold in
both hands and “fly” for the nearest mail-
boat. The banking returns for the June
quarter have now been issued, with these
results: —
Commonwealth deoosits to-day .. £141,377,328
Increase during 12 months ..
Commonwealth advances to-day .. Ild,i4i,^»
Increase during 12 months .. 11, .47,0il
Commenting upon these figures, the Argus
—about the Toriest journal in Australia-
had the following: —

turns. The increase in land-settlement is large!,

must by now be about equal to that of

The Sugar Strike—and After.
The movement toward the closer union of
trades and labor unions in Australia got a
long lift from the sugar workers’ strike in
Queensland. Last sugar season something
over 40 petty strikes occurred in the indus-
try, most of them engineered by separate
sectional or district unions. Many of those
strikes were failures, or, at best, brought
only local and temporary relief. As a mat-
ter of fact, the workers were almost entirely
at the mercy of unscrupulous bosses. The
agreements under which the men worked
were relics of the bad, old, black-labor days,
and were manacles, legirons and a whole
armory of fetters. In many instances, these
agreements, besides stipulating for from 60
to w'ell over 72 hours’ work at 225. 6d. a
week, empow'ered the bosses to hold 25 per
cent, of the men’s wages. If the men worked
right on to the end of the season without
resenting the open insults of bosses, and
without resorting to bad language about
food, accommodation or sanitary arrange-
ments, they were rewarded with what wms
referred to in lordly magnificence as a
bonus, the said bonus being their ow T n 25
per cent, of withheld wages. If, however,
any sugar-worker uprose and held a bit of
tainted meat suggestively beneath the boss’s
nose, or in any way sought to assert that right
of the individual which is so dear to the heart
of the fat G.S.R. dividend-drawers, he got
the sack, and the employer got the 25 per
cent, of his wages. Those agreements cov-
ered about as cruel a system of legal wage-
slavery and wage-robbery as could be con-
ceived ; yet the men, broken up into district
and sectional unions, were powerless to re-
fuse to sign them. At Townsville last De-
cember, however, the sugar-unionists were
seized with a rush of brains to the head.
They dropped their petty little penny-ha’-
penny shows, and combined under the banner
of the Amalgamated Workers’ Association.
Then they saw something of their power.
They asked the sugar-bosses to confer with
them as to future 'labor conditions in the
field and mills —a clean slate to be used. The
bosses, remembering the little unions of a
day or two before, laughed (the C.S.R. Co.
sneered) and refused. Then the men wrote
several demands on the slate, asked again
and got another refusal. When the season
opened the men declined to work under the
Md agreements: and so the trouble began.
At first the strike was looked upon as cer-
tain of the doom of the just-broken Brisbane
gas strike. But at the back of the gas-
stokers had been an unwieldy, loose-jointed
trades and Labor Council, which at the
first strong pressure crumpled up. Behind
the sugar-workers, on the other hand, was
ona bier, solid union of unions: and as the
tight continued it gathered strength. The
AAV .A. commanded the respect of the other
big unions, whicn were drawn into the
trouble; and some of these bodies—the big
transport unions of Australia —seeing that
there was no escape, “congressed” to save
themselves, with the result that they also
§aved the sugar-workers. But there was
another, and very important, outcome of the
congress. The transport workers, them-
selves at peace witn their employers, earn-
ing satisfactory wages and enjoying fair
laoor conditions, saw that they were in
danger of being dragged into other indus-
irail turmoils; and they, too, were seized
with a rush of brains to the head. “If we're
to be dragged into rows,” they said, “we
piean to have a word or twm to say in the pre-
liminary stages of the rows.” Their proposal,
therefore, now is to form a kind of strike
council, which shall have power to deal with
all future strike-proposals by affiliated bodies
throughout Australia. The establishment
of this council will have the effect of stop-
ping much reckless striking, of arranging
fair terms with employers, in minor matters,
and of assuring for every just cause the sup-
port of the whole of the affiliated unions.
But it is only one step in the right direc-
tion. If the A.W.U., the A.W.A. and the
Rural Workers’ Association were, drawn
together into one great industrial union, with
fhe support of the transport workers, also
united in one organisation, the condition of
labor in the primary-producing industries of
Australia could be fixed on a fair basis, and
almost for a certainty without any strike-
fighting—an immense saving to the workers
and to the public. And the same thing is
applicable to all other industries. The ulti-
mate object is, of course, to settle these dis-
putes by arbitration; but it is certain that
arbitration is least likely to fail when the
parties are more or less evenly matched.
When one party feels that it could lick the
other party hollow in an appeal to force,
while it might itself be licked hollow in an
appeal to reason, it will naturally dodge
the appeal to reason with all the tricks it
knows.

The Babu Spirit in Australia.
Melbourne University has chosen its new
Professor of English, and as this paper fore-
casted a month ago, he is a foreign pro-
duct. Walter Murdoch, an Australian
and an M.A. of Melbourne, has, as lecturer
in English literature, given eight of the best
years of his life to his University. His
capacity has never been questioned. By all
the laws of decency, and fair-dealing,, he
should, in the circumstances, have been given
the preference over an outsider, assuming
the merits of the two men were anywhere
near equal. The Australian and the gentle-
man from Aberdeen who has supplanted
him, are, in fact, so much on a par, in the
opinion of unbiassed judges, that the Eng-
lish committee which met in London to
consider the new appointment bracketed
them equal, out of some hundreds of appli-
cants. Thus the University Council, by its
action, says, in effect, that it will not con-
sider an Australian where there is an
equally capable man offering on the other
side of the earth; it announces to the
world that, in its opinion, the product of
Melbourne University is inferior to the pro-
duct of a fifth-rate British University; in
short, it behaves in the Babu-like fashion of
the Tory official from one end of the Com-
monwealth to the other. The province, of a
University is not merely to teach. It is ex-
pected to do something in the way of form-
ing and strengthening its members’ charac-
ters. And particularly in Australia, which
is just learning to walk in a national man-
ner of speaking,' nothing is needed so much
as that the young men should have instilled
into them a proper pride of race and coun-
try. Hence the last thing Adstralia should
tolerate from its Parliaments and Councils
is the belittling of provedly-capable local
men for the glory and benefit of total
stfangers. Among the well-kicked or sub-
ject races the tendency w'hich has just
found expression in Melbourne is rife the
world over ; the native of Ceylon has grov-
elled to his oversea rulers for so long now
that he would not be happy if he were
asked to govern himself, and the Bengalee
mostly treats the imported sahib like a god.
But Australia is no place for such abase-
ment ; and the sooner such deplorably bad
patriots as the members of the Melbourne
University Council are apprised of the fact
the better for this country’s reputation and
self-respect. So far as the Chair of Litera-
ture is concerned, the damage is done; but
at the end of the year the Chairs of Philoso-
phy and Agriculture will have to be filled.
If, as is already freely prophesied in Vic-
toria, the Council sends to a remote part of
the British Isles for these professors also,
the public, which pays Melbourne Univer-
sity £21,000 per annum, should push a
vigorous hand into the scandal.

The Defence Department.
The infrequent Australian warrior who
happens to be sufficiently grown-up to un-
derstand such things, is smiling hard at a
sort of tragi-comedy that is being presented
by an all-military caste in the Common-
wealth theatre. Spectators should know,
in order to get a proper understanding of
the plot, (1) that Senator Pearce, Minister
for Defence, is, at the time of writing,
somewhere off the northern coast of Aus-
tralia, on his way home from the Corona-
tion; (2) that Major-General Hoad, Chief
of the General Staff, is so seriously ill that
his retirement into private life is imminent;
and (3) that Colonel Bridges, the recently-
appointed Head of the Military College at
Duntroon, sees no valid reason why he
shouldn’t succeed to Hoad’s job, if Hoad
should not be able to keep it. Colonel
Bridges and Colonel Foster, R.E. (lec-
turer on Military Science at Sydney Uni-
versity), are friends; in fact, it was mainly
owing to the former that the Engineer-
Colonel came to this country. They are
both up north, at present: and unless the
local soldier, diagnoses the situation .with
lamentable inaccuracy, their object is to
head off the Minister and arrange (a) that
Colonel Bridges shall step into General
Hoad’s shoes, when they become vacant;
and (ft) that Colonel Foster shall simul-
taneously proceed to mononolise the foot-
wear of Colonel Bridges. It is against the
latter contingency that The Bulletin de-
sires to lodge a protest. Colonel Foster is,
no doubt, a brainy and knowledgable sol-
dier. But he is as English as they make
theni. and devoid of any experience in the
training .of Australian boys or men. He has
never seen.active service, and hence lacks one
of the most necessary qualifications for the
head of a military school—namely, the capac-
ity to talk to the students in the art of war
from personal experience. Above all, he is,
and always has been, out of sympathy with
the compulsory service idea on which Dun-
troon stands broad-based. The theory of
the fighting game can be inculcated by any
pedant who has had access to books and
sufficient industry to read up their contents.
The practice of it can only be taught by one
who has known the real thing. The ideal
head for the college at Duntroon would be
an Australian who had gained his know-
ledge of warfare, not merely from the text-
books, but on the tented field. There are
plenty offering, and if Rumor proves truth-
ful, and the present Director of the Dun-
troon establishment abandons his job, one
of them should be given a show'.
The Sacrifice at Homebush.
“Wonga,” on a piece of -wanton cruelty: —
Disrespectful though it was to Mr. Johnson
(imp.), the Public Works Committee fell out of
bed early the other morning, and wandered out to
see what was doing at the Homebush (Sydney)
Saleyards. They discovered quite a lot of things
calculated to cause Paterfamilias, as he read of them,
to turn aside from his succulent steak and juicy
chop. Crippled and dead sh'eep appeared to fill
much of:the landscape, and crowded pens and what-
not seemed to call Johnson a liar when he said there
was plenty of accommodation at the yards, if the
thing was managed properly. Still the im-
ported Czar wasn’t far out when, no doubt
at the instigation of some unacknowledged
understrapper, he said that the deaths in
the trucks were due mostly to owners overcrowding
their stock. Owners overcrowd all tight—jamb
them in so tight that, when they get down—well,
they stop down. And Johnson's trains are now so
rottenly slow that the stock have plenty of oppor-
tunity to get down —and stay down.
Of course it is cruel; damnably, wickedly, un-
necessarily and foolishly cruel! But there is nothing
new about it. The whole business is the sacrifice to
two gods that /the average citizen of N. S. Wales has
long worshipped—the Greatness of Sydney and Cheap-
ness. Shoving everything into Sydney—people and
the stuff to feed the people—meant a jamb some-
where, and the stock have got part of the jamb, to
the eternal glory of Sydney. They could be com-
fortably killed up country, and the carcases brought
down sweet and fresh for Sydney to eat, in refriger-
ated cars. But that wouldn’t have suited Fat in
Sydney, so a whole lot of country meatworks were
closed up for years, until the rabbits gave them a
job. And, as far as the cruelty part of the business
is concerned, it simply arose from the old-time gospel
of “cheapness”—shove as many sheep into a truck as
will go in! Owners haven’t altogether got used to
the fact that sheep are too valuable now to treat
like that.
Anyhow, why this surprise at the cruelty? Aus-
tralia is a cruel country. Anyone who knows it
from the inside knows that, and the old regime
didn’t better things. Perhaps the new will. But
Nature herself is cruel in Australia, and men who
have spent months pulling half-dead and whole-dead
sheep out of mudholes, in order to save their pelts;
have gone round on a frosty morning cutting the
throats of sheep and lambs after the crows have got
their eyes out; have seen the paddocks full of blinded
sheep, hopping about with their hoofs scorched off
by bush fire; have burnt hundreds of anthrax-rotten
carcases; have heard the endless moan of mobs of
dying cattle smiting the cloudless sky; have spent
days marking and footrotting, castrating and brand-
ing; and all the time have been riding over dying
and dead rabbits, and inhaling the stench of thou-
sands of extra-dead ones —men who have gone
through all this, or most of it.' are not going to let
the bumping of a few thirsty . sheep spoil their sleep
at night. Stockraising in Australia, especially under
its unsettled, undeveloped conditions, was one of
the cruellest callings under the sun. But that did
not interfere with the Sydney folk eating their steak
and chop in comfort.
There is no reason, though, why the bloody his-
tory of the past should run op for ever. Thanks to
the progressive land tax and a few other “SociaTstic”
contrivances, the country stands a chance of being
properly settled. Given settlement. and decentralisa-
tion, stock-raising can be carried on under humane
conditions, worthy of a civilised communifv. It is
jogging that way now, and the promise is great.
But red-blooded men don’t drop the habits of a life-
time in a moment, and, after all. we want their
blood to run red yet awhile. Still, we have just
about got rid of the old gang that shot down the
blacks when they wanted some sport, on the plea
that Binghi had burnt a bit of grass or killed a sheep
or two. The smell of that decade is still hanging
about the horizon. We have now with us the second
generation that over-stocked and stock-murdered :
that poisoned waterholes to clear the rabbits, and
go denuded the country of its natural game; that
spoiled half the country in their greed, and were gen-
erally “grand and heroic pioneers.”
They are going, but they haven’t gone. • The
slaughter at Homebush is but the unburnt offering to
their god—Greed ! But it happens where the city
can’t help noticing it —and so there is a cry of
horror ! Well, what are those who are horrified going
do about it? Are they going to kick out the poli-
ticians who want to drag everything to' Sydney, who
have blocked the opening of outports, who. have
aimed and schemed to have all the killing, canning
and freezing done, not in the country, but by their
own back door? If not, they are mere humbugs and
hypocrites.
The Age declares for a municipal re-
volution at the Melbourne civic elections
that are to happen this week. It alleges
that the Yarra village lags hopelessly behind
the times municipally, and cries out for an
infusion of new blood “into the lack-lustre
and senile organism which has so long and
so stubbornly ground down all reformative
and progressive proposals.” meaning the
present hidebound city and suburban coun-
cils in the Greater Melbourne area —coun-
cils nominated by property and controlled by
vested interests. The Age rails at its old
enemy, the gas supply, “a private monopoly
which fleeces the ratepayers to the limits of
endurance” ; it rages at the “inadequate and
over-costly electric supply” ; it calls in a
loud voice for markets and r. better admin-
istration of public health. It declares war
on the “old gang,” and calls for their ex-
tinction. It crumples up the fabric of their
dignity, spits upon their robes, defiles with
pitch their wigs, and puts hemlock in their
turtle soup bv referring in withering irony
to their “nreference for dignified repose, and
such placid, pompous and pleasing relaxa-
tions from indolence as are provided by occa-
sional opportunities which come to them
from time to time to frame and present loyal
addresses to an arriving or departing Gover-
nor.” But it hits the old regime hardest
amidships when it lays at the aldermanic
door this charge :
They oppose the fine ideal of a Greater Melbourne
as a matter of instinct and self-interest. It is odious
to them because they know that it' would sweep
many redundant councils out of existence, diminish
the number of councillors, and compel all municipal
representatives of the people to work instead of
slumbering in the service of the people. , To the
type of men we are considering, economy, efficiency 1
and activity ’are ugly bugbears. They shudder at.
the notion of the enlarged responsibilities which
public opinion demands that municipalism should
undertake. (
Yet this Age, which crows, so admirably for
a policy of whole-hog municipal Socialism.as
applied to its own particular little dunghill,
is the Age which shrieked so wildly abofft
the horrors of Socialism when the Federal
control of monopolies was proposed!
. —♦ ■ ■
One shrieking feature of the N. S. Walds
by-elections was the free expenditure- on
halls, bands, printing, advertising and other
means to influence votes. So far, the re-
ports do not record the musical entertain-
ments and free feeds that disgraced the last
Federal elections; but the overbidding for
bands and the monopolisation of halls and
the wholesale paid organisation and can-
vassing are bad enough. That both parties
are equally deep in the mire does not make
such doings less a form of political corrup-
tion. If this kind of thing is to go on. then
it will be farewell to democratic government
—-elections will be won, as the Referenda
fight was, by the party with the heaviest
purse: and heavy purses do not fight on the
side of Democracy.

“The Old Soldier” : The first police-court
case against a young mutineer, who wouldn't
“eyes front” when his commanding officer
told him to. has ended at the Glebe
(N.S.W.) in a £2 fine. It was a bad case,
as; the young rascal used some shocking
language. But the whole business is bad,
this of trying to shove the entire Defence
preparation on to infants. Most of the
youngsters of from 14 to 16 have had a hard
day at the shop or the school, and the extra
work involved in a couple of hours’ hard
training may have serious results on imma-
ture bodies. The rotten system, or no-
system, of trying to throw the burden on the
children cannot last, and will before long
excite a spirit of resistance that cannot fail
to be dangerous, and will certainly quench
all enthusiasm in the cause of real defence.
“Dxjn Brown”: Before any more ocean
mail contracts are renewed, it would be to
the advantage of this continent if politicians
became better acquainted with the possible
routes to Europe. The Suez Canal route,
which is horribly expensive, isn’t the only
one. To illustrate how the canal dues hit
the shipowner, and consequently the ship-
owner’s clients, take the case of a steamer
trading between Bombay and the U.K. —a
steamer I was interested in. She was 3250
tons gross. Canal dues amounted to over £950
each way, and, with light, harbor and other
charges added, every passage through the
canal cost well on to £llOO. This sum had
to be paid in cash either at Port Said or
Suez by the owners’ agent, w T ho then drew
upon the owners, of course collecting com-
mission for the advance. Such heavy char-
ges ought of themselves to set us consider-
ing whether we must go that way. And
there is no “must” about it. The Cape route
(32,207 miles from London to Adelaide) is
quite as economical. A vessel averaging IS
knots would accomplish the distance in 284
days. One averaging 20 knots would do it
in three days less. On other grounds the
Cape route demands signal preference. It
is an ocean route with no canal and land-
locked seas to cause trouble, in the event of
European complications; and it has the
complete approval of naval and military
authorities, who perceive its enormous • ad-
vantages in war time.

“N.Z.” LOOKS in again:—
I want to contradict The Bulletin,' which contra-
dicted me when I contradicted it syme time ago on
the position of Labor in Maoriland: I stated then
that Labor in M.L. had already started in on ah in-
dependent Labor policy, and was going to score.
Since then Labor has elected about 20 pledged men
to municipal councils, and four to Harbor Boards,
and has got about another dozen ready for the gen-
eral elections. The Trades Councils have further
engaged Walter Thomas Mills, of Milwaukee, for
six months to push a Federation scheme, whereby
- all wages men will be classed into 12 groups, the
whole to be used as a machine for capturing , the
Government. The scheme is (leaving details out' of con-
sideration) one of the most complete ever formulated,
and is catching on like wildfire.. Only the most
revolutionary of the red-raggers are standing out,
and they stand out. in sheer cussedness. Mills ex-
presses himself as highly satisfied, and says 25 years
would be the minimum time required to accomplish
as much elsewhere. Tlip prospects of getting a
number of sitting M’s.H.II. to endorse the nropo-v
tion are also distinctly good, and, generally, the
future of Labor in M.L. is bright.

more that it will be extremely gratified to

Hi, there, Tommy, get your rifle! Yes, we
know you’re small a trifle,
But you've got to leave your marbles, and
must learn to liump a gun.
Whilst your Dad is at the races, backing
"stiffened” mokes for places,
You must learn to be a soldier—Shoulder
arms! Step lively! ’Shun!
Brother Bill is playing cricket; whilst he’s
busy at the wicket,
Whilst he’s fooling round in flannels, you
must learn to be a Man ;
You’re Australia’s sole defender, though
you're weak and mighty tender,
You must hump Australia’s burden —that’s
this nation’s splendid plan!
Uncle Jim is pigeon-shooting, brother Jack
is football-rooting—
Hear the cheering and the jeering, whilst
you learn your bit of drill.
There's a row that calls for hoeing ; whilst
the “half-time” beers are flowing,
You are “forming fours” and marching—
hear the umpire’s whistle shrill!
Brother Bill is bravely batting, making
runs along the matting;
Dad is cursing mokes and bookies, tearing
tickets as he goes ;
Whilst the slaughtered pigeons flutter o’er
the jerking trap and shutter —
You £(lone are getting ready for To-morrow’s
Certain foes!
Bill the mighty, Bill the hero, seems to
me to slump to zero —
You're the only Man Who Matters, though
you’re very small and young;
In these days when peace grows brittle,
march the solders extra-little—
And I reckon brother William might as
well be drowned or hung!
Uncle Jim the pigeon-shooter, brother Jack
the football-rooter —
They’re a pair of service-dodgers, ne’er a
drill prescribed for them;
Also, Dad, the pony-backer, he’s a useless
sort of slacker,
You're the only White Australian on the
nation’s job pro tern.!
All the rest are dodging service; very strong
to me their nerve is—
“ Sports” are they, whose frenzied worship
hath no sacramental frill;
Ilorse and football, dog and cricket —yea,
their altar is the wicket,
And a special sort of halo floats above the
sainted Bill !
Whilst the manhood of the nation yells its
wrath or approbation,
Whilst the umpire streaks for shelter, only
Tommy humps his gun ;
Bill and Jack nave got no rifles, can’t be
bothered with such trifles—
So the school-kid serves Australia whilst the
sands eternal run !
Yea, the cheerful kid goes tramping whilst
the football herds are stamping—
He is marching back and forwards whilst
his elder brethren play ;
Whilst the kid is marching slicker, Uncle
James, the pigeon-sticker,
Murders poultry like a Christian every
blessed Saturday !
Dad likewise pursues the ponies—very sad
his vesper groan is,
“Mever backed a blasted winner,” and his
cash supports the Yids ;
Whilst the football fools are braying, seems
to me Australia’s saying:
".Since my manhood’s cheap and worthless,
i must put my trust in kids!”

For ages gone the sweated slaves
Of Britain’s wealth-production
Have sung “Britannia Rules the Waves,”
And rarely raised a ruction;
Scant food they earned in former years,
Whilst yet the country grew it;
Lean workers sweated bitter tears —
They might have struck, restrained by
fears,
They never rose to do it.
Then Freetrade came, and merchants
smiled,
But farmers groaned and snorted :
Black clouds of smoke the land defiled
Whose food was now imported.
Old Cobden’s creed became the rage,
And no keen eyes saw through it;
The Kings of Commerce on the stage
Bade Labor kneel to kiss its wage —
And Labor knelt to do it.
Though foreign competition vext
The ruthless fatted spoilers.
Still sticking to the Cobden text,
They bled the timid toilers;
The “classes” mocked the “masses’ ” pain,
Nor thought they’d ever rue it;
But workers, seeking long in vain
The quickest way their end to gain,
Have found the way to do it.
The city merchant goes in dread
Of lacking meat for dinner;
He dreams of Famine when in bed,
And when he wakes he’s thinner.
He’d have no use for djsh, or plate,
Or pepper from the cruet
If Labor ceased to feed the State,
And let the wolf in at the gate —
O Lord ! should Labor do it!
The waves that Britain rules in song
Are Britain’s sleepless gaolers,
Who kindly bear her food along
In vessels manned by sailors ;
The transport workers, down at heels,
Were strong, but never knew it,
Till—biff! and now the nation reels:
Proud Capital to Labor kneels,
And begs him not to Mo it!
The starved have turned the starvers. pale,
And Heaven’s bells are ringing ;
Old Fatman’s ships that brave the gale
To Britain’s shores are bringing
The food which is the Sweater’s life —
But shall the Sweater chew it?
The transport striker holds the knife,
The snirit of revenge is rife—
And if need be he’ll do it.

see M.L. Labor get into a unanimous stride
instead of colliding with itself round every
corner. All the same, the paper isn’t wildly
encouraged by the optimism of W. T. Mills,
who stated in Dunedin some days back that
“he had been in the country now for about
five weeks, and was convinced that there
could be no question that the people
of M.L. were more than ready to make a
very earnest and conclusive fight for the
adoption at the earliest possible day of all
the proposals made by either the Socialist or
Labor parties.” If he had been in the coun-
try five years, such an opinion might have
been valuable. But in that case he probably
wouldn’t have had it.
“lluffin Guffin” : The other day I met
the farmer for whom I did my first work as
a boy, over 30 years ago. He has the same
farm, and carries it on in much the same
way as he did back in 1872, when he selected
in Western Victoria. He reckoned that per-
haps he was a bit behind the times; but he
excused himself by adding that he did not
reach out for more acres than he could man-
age. No, he had no labor troubles. He was
satisfied with the return from practically his
own labor. He was a farmer of land, and
not of men ; he got his living out of his own
soil, and not out of others’ toil. Scarcity of
labor, therefore, didn’t worry him. So far
as he was concerned, there wasn’t any
scarcity. I never before saw so clearly what
this “scarcity of labor” really is. When a
man complains of it, he means something
like this: “I want to make a lot of money
quickly. I expected to make a lot out of
men whom I hoped to employ. But I can’t
get them, so I’m disappointed.” Then the
employers, or would-be employers, start com-
peting for the labor that is offering; if they
can’t grab the whole loaf they had
expected, some of them decide to try
to land half of it, by whacking the
expected profits with the workmen. Thus
wages go up, and soon the howl starts:
“Scarcity of labor.” In short: “I can’t find
as many tools as I want to make as much
money as I want.” So the disappointed
would-be Fatman fumes, and blames every-
body but himself. My old bpss may have an
idea that he is out of date, but he is really
ahead of it. He has found the way, and the
only way, to avoid labor troubles.

“Lollypop” : “Virtue’s Reward” (B.
17/8/T1) deals only with the girls who
serve sweetstuffs for a paltry wage, and
“do” for themselves. A far larger class live
at home and use the cash they earn for
pocket-money. Private Enterprise in bigger
spheres of action than the confectionery
trade makes huge profit out of the practice
of dealing out mock wages to complaisant
workers of both sexes. In drapery and mil-
linery shops the absurdly underpaid girl ranks
as a matter of course, and in warehouses
and offices the services of male “juniors” are
got dirt-cheap for the reason that they are,
in many cases, not even bound to buy their
own clothes. It is these bogus workers who
are to blame, in great part, for the unfortu-
nates who, lacking comparatively-speaking
affluent parents, are driven to eke out joy-
less lives on seven half-crowns a week or
thereabouts. The system is rotten fore and
aft and amidships; it is equally demoralis-
ing to the pushful employer who takes ad-
vantage of it, and to the careless young
slave to “respectability ” who allows him or
herself to be exploited by it; and its evil
effects on the national life are obvious. Some
day the tiger “Socialism” will wade in and
insist that every adult who is useful enough
to be employed at all, shall, ipso facto, be
paid a living wage—and that regardless of
sex or of the class of business which does
the employing. But the time is not yet.
The craze tor the Genteel in life —the
fatuous passion which prevented the clerks

Another well-brined sailor, Captain
Stewart, was entered in the log of Eter-
nity at Dunedin (M.L.) recently. It was
he who saved the Dunedin Harbor Board’s
big dredge from dropping into Davy Jones’s
cellar with all hands. The pumps had become
choked in a rush of dirty weather in the
Bay of Biscay, and the dredge filled. There
was one chance left, and the skipper took
the risk himself. He dived into the bilges
and with superhuman effort cleared the
pumps. The seamen didn’t give him three
cheers then, because they hadn’t time, but
they’ve been doing it ever since.
John Burns’s position in the British
Cabinet must have been an awkward one
when the question came forward of bringing-
troops to overawe strikers, led by his old
comrades —Tom Mann, of the “clanking
chains,” and the velvet-coated Tillett. But,
as a fact, Burns, though a great strike
leader, never initiated or advocated a strike,
lie was always called in when the strike
was under weigh, and the strikers were in
need of an undoubted leader. Twenty-one
vears ago. in the dockers’ strike, Burns
maintained order in a remarkable way. Be-
fore that, however, he had been twice “in
trouble.” In 1887, in the unemployed dem-
onstration in Trafalgar Square, he and Cun-
ninghnme Graham were sent to gaol for “un-
lawful assembly” after having had then-
heads battered while trying to break through
the police cordon. In those proceedings,
Asquith, Burns’s present chief, defended Gra-
ham, and Burns defended himself. Earlier,
m 1886, Burns had been arrested for an in-
flammatory speech in Trafalgar Square, but
was let off. In personal appearance, Burns
is a small, vigorous, bearded, grizzled, pock-
marked man, who is white enough to be
taken for twice his actual age—s 3.
Best way to cast out the demon of greed

“SMOKING IN THE ARMY.”
The recent report on the health of the Army brings
;he question of cigarette smoking to the forefront, in
,iew of the statement that many of the rejections of
otherwise strong recruits are caused by disordered
action of the heart, which, in the case of young
soldiers, is greatly aggravated, if not induced, by
excessive smoking of inferior cigarettes. The in-
crease of this habit year by year has been the subject
of remark in several commands, and there is a possi-
bility, if not an actual probability, of strong mea-
sures being taken by the authorities to bring about
a marked diminution in these affections as a whole.
If every smoker would only choose some good, reliable
brand of tobacco, and roll his own cigarette, using

H. B. Irving has gone, trailing laurel
wreaths and suchlike tokens of appreciation
in his wake. There is a possibility that he
may return and show in “The Bells” and
“Jekyll and Hyde.” To-night (Thursday)
“Miss Gibbs” appears at Her Majesty’s for
one of the shortest seasons on record, and on
Saturday week the Melba opera co. opens in
“Traviata.”
*- * * *
One of the most alluring and artistic cir-
cumstances in “The Merry Widow,” which
still holds the fort at Sydney Royal, is Miss
Dorothy Brunton, who took over the role of
Miss Lottie Sargent last week —-the latter
having been ordered away for a rest-cure.
Miss Brunton is a daughter of the late John
Brunton, scenic artist, and a protegee of
Mrs. Hugh Ward.
** * *
“The Man from Outback” has been filling
Sydney Criterion nightly, and—the public
craving for bellowdrama being what it is—
would undoubtedly continue to fill it till
such time as the fabled Maorilander took
his stand on the North Shore Bridge and
gazed upon the ruins of the Ferry monopoly,
were he left to himself. However, the
theatre is booked for the Ethel Irving co.
from next Saturday night, and so, on Fri-
day, the uproarious creation of Bailey and
Duggan must hump his bluey. He will drop
it at the Palace Theatre next week.
* * * -*
“Cripple Creek,” which has been flowing
a banker at the Adelphi Theatre, will have
its supply cut off on Saturday by “Nick
Carter, Detective.” The new piece is an ex-
citing story by Arthur Shirley and Landeck.

At the Sydney Palace The Old Woman is
still living in a shoe, and nightly seeing to
it that T. Thumb, R. Crusoe, R. Riding
Hood, J. Horner, D. Whittington, S. Claus,
the Industrial Union of Federated Stage
Fairies, the Liberal and Reform League of
Goblins, Donkeys, Cardboard Giants, etc.,
supply the goods that the public pays for at
the box-office.
H. B. Irving, Secretary Arden Godfrey , Stage-
manager Tom Reynolds and part of the reper-
toire descend on Melbourne.
Quite a number of people can now find
Sydney Y.M.C.A. Hall without assistance.
Joseph Blascheck and Mildred Wrighton, the
twin star performers, have been sparkling
there for more than three weeks; and _so
many astronomers and others have pilgrim-
aged to see the new constellation that the
bare temple in the wilderness may be said
to have a large and regular congregation.

Clarke and Mostol, comedians and dancers,
duly arrived at Sydney Tivoli last Saturday,
and agitated their talented feet; but Louie
Tracy, “the Dapper, Dandy Boy,” was too
ill to appear, and was scratched for one
week. Meanwhile, the bill has been bright-
ened by the return of Fred Bluett, who al-
ways contrives to be diverting. Alexander
Prince, of the concertinas, back for a brief
farewell season, is squeezing out impressive,
organ-like strains; and Lamberti has a
charnge of programme which is well worth
seeing. The other principals of the show
are entertainer Bach, ventriloquist Max,
Marguerite Ismay and Girls (dancers). Pas-
tor and Merle (comedians), and Irving Sayles
(smiler).

Miss Eva Mudge continues to astound
the multitude with song and lightning-
changes at the National Amphitheatre, and
Captain Winter’s educated dogs are work-
ing for their master’s living in their cus-
tomary devoted and intellectual fashion. On
the other hand, the Piquays and McGee
and Reece are making ready to depart.

The late Cardinal has been the man of the
hour at the picture shows. Spencer’s, at
the Lyceum, produced a series on Monday
night. One film showed the prelate’s last
important public appearance, at the laying
of the foundation stone of St. Mary’s High
School. Others pictured the lying-in-state
at the Cathedral, and the imposing funeral
procession on Sunday—the latter an excel-
lent reproduction. The “Margaret Catch-
pole” drama has been in its last nights ; and
there is the usual assortment of humorous
and educational subjects.
** * *
West’s had some realistic funeral pictures
on the screen at the Princess on Monday
night. The programme included, also, “The
Carrier Pigeon,” one of the interminable
Indian dramas ; another of the never-ending
Royal pictures, this time showing the King-
in Edinburgh; “Chemical Action,” an ab-
sorbingly interesting scientific film; and a
dozen or so more. The West season at the
Glaciarium begins shortly.
-*■ -M * -X-
Her Majesty’s (Melb.), swept, garnished
and greatly changed in its interior construc-
tion, will reopen on Saturday with “Ham-
let.” H. B. Irving is to introduce himself
to local notice as the loquacious Dane ; also
Miss Baird will appear as the demented
spinster who sought death amongst the
water-lilies and tadpoles, and the rest of the
co. will assist to repeat the Sydney per-
formance of a few weeks back. Melbourne
ought to be ready for another meal of classic
drama, anyhow. Seeing that the approach-
ing feast of murder, suicide, manslaughter
and immortal spectre is to be framed in a
new proscenium, a furious demand for seats
may be taken for granted.
* * * -*
At the Royal this is the last night of
“Lady Frederick” and her four suitors.
There is a growing conviction that the pretty
widow closes with the best offer of marriage.
The elderly, spasmodic Admiral is really out
of the question the moment he pops it; if the
lady had given her hand to the millionheir
of Aaron Levitzky, she would probably have
slain him with her noble birth; and the
hard, metallic lordling who loved her for her
face-powder must have maddened her with
his submission the first time she flared up.
But in Paradine Fouldes she will find a nice,
easy master, a rich man, and a good old pal.
For these last nights Miss Ethel Irving has
ceased to play Dolly of the Little Bills as an
afterpiece to “Lady Frederick.” Dolly now
comes as a curtain-raiser, and Miss Rosslyn
Vane takes the name part in lieu of the star,
with the result that the comedy changes its
appearance and sounds rather like a roaring
farce. However, this alteration obviated a
lot of misunderstanding among the audience.
Previously there was a tendency to regard
“Dolly’s Bills” as the last act of “Lady Fre-
derick,” and several softheaded citizens are
said to have gone home wondering what it
all meant.
** * *
On Saturday, enter “The Chocolate Sol-
dier” at the Royal! Rumor ha|s talked much
about Strauss’s music for this free adapta-
tion ot “Arms and the Man,” and the advt.
states that “The Chocolate Soldier” has put
a girdle round the earth. Miss Winifred
O’Connor and some newly-imported princi-
pals-—there are but seven in all —will have
the honor of passing the girdle round the
Commonwealth.
** * *
At Melb. Princess’s the stormy winds do
blow, and the Somers Gun doth glow as be-
fore. Melodrama, like the gee-gee that gives
Moses a “skinner,” may be said to run in all
shapes; and “Via Wireless” is one of the
most picturesque shapes. Until Friday of
this week the angular detective from Scot-
land Yard will do his duty and arrest the
murderer of the Somers Gun aforesaid, and
when that unique criminal has accepted his
fate for the last time, “The Speckled Band”
will take his place.
#* * *
The absent-minded villain, who thought-
lessly waves a white flag after instructing
the enemy to kill the man who puts up that
token of surrender —the sinfully stupid vil-
lain with blood upon his hands and wadding
on his chest —will die no more at the King’s
after Friday. “Tommy Atkins” is about to
march out of the bill. “The French Spy”
will provide Walter Baker and Frances
Ross with congenial characters on Saturday.
** * *
At the Opera House the array of Eng-
land’s Greatest and America’s Most Famous,
not to mention Australia’s native talent, is
the same as it was a week ago. This is one
of the times when the Rickards show con-
tains naught that is strangely thrilling nor
unduly depressing.

Of Spencer’s shower of blessings at Mel-
bourne Olympia last Saturday, this paper
preferred “The Queen of Nineveh,” in which
a couple of neople showed that poisoning,
like Art, has its tricks and technique. In
“The Demon Dog” the theme at least had
the quality of age; while “Lake Garda”
supplied some beautiful scenes Irom Nature’s
wonderful album of views. For the excess-
ively loyal folk Spencer also screened “The
Investiture at Carnarvon of the Prince of
Wales”-—a young man who must by now
realise that royalty’s jobs, consist mainly of
walking on carpets and bobbing to crowds.

The Plimmer-Denniston Co. finished a good
season at Adelaide Royal with the “Tan-
queray” tragedy, which is possibly destined
to live as the typical drama of the present
age. Mrs. Brough seemed to emphasise the
whimsical and humorous Side of the char-
acter more than of old. She had to make a
speech on the farewell night, and told an in-
terviewer that the higher-class drama seems
to be more of a financial success than it
used to be. Plimmer —a sound Aubrey Tan-
queray—promises to be back soon with new
plays. Denniston, by the way, contented
himself with the small part of Ardale, leav-
ing to Sweeney the “fat” lines of Cayley
Drummle. The Tivoli has a strong bill,
headed by the gracefully-powerful Alcide
Capitaine and the Binns musical tramps;
also, Arthur Croxon and the Charmeroy lady
monologue with much effect, and the Dogs
continue to stand on one paw and wave
three and a tail towards the ceiling. The
Wondergraph has been starring films of the
Jacquerie, France’s long-past preliminary
canter for a Revolution —finely stage-mana-
ged. West’s, Vitoscope and Empire com-
pete keenly, and all the suburban halls break
out in a rash of pictures at intervals. Other
shows have varied from boxing at the Sta-
dium to lectures by Patrick Glynn on “Sin-
cerity in Literature”—clever but heavy—and
by Frederick Bevan on his old friend Sulli-
van —light and richly illustrated by songs.
The S. Aus. Education Office is the un-
lucky one of the State. Minister Coneybeer
has only just recovered from an illness dur-
ing which his life was despaired of. Nov
Director Williams and Chief Inspector Mau
ghan are absent on long sick leave. Tin
present acting permanent head is a brothe
of Neale, who ran the Tasmanian depart
ment for a time.
Captain William Bendall, one of the old
time salt-junk sailors, slipped his cable a
Wellington (M.L.) last week, after 80 yeai
of the storms and calms of life. Just on hal
a century ago he arrived in M.L. waters i
his own ship, the Three Sisters, with ;
cargo of miners rushing to the Otago golc
fields. In 1878 he was appointed pilot a
Wellington to the old Panama Steam Navi
gation Co., and, later, marine surveyor, to
the Wellington Underwriters’ Association.
His best-known exploit was the salvage of
£25,000 worth of gold, which went down
with the Koranui in the French Pass. Wit!
his divers he secured the lot in 24 hours
When he signed on with Charon he was

“0.K.”: Melbourne the other week had a good
sample submitted to it of the sort of theatrical fare
which may be expected from the new combine if the
combine is merely going to “give the public what
the public wants.” “Silver King” was revived for
the 49th time or thereabouts, and the public stood
two deep at the back of the d.-c., the seating ac-
commodation of the whole house being unequal to
the demand. This happened eyery night for a week,
so there could be no doubt about the public’s want-
ing that revival of “Silver King.” Yet it was the
absolutely weakest performance of the old drama,
judged on the bulk, that J.C.W. has ever staged in
Melbourne. This suggests that any old piece with a
iirst-rate reputation can be produced in Second-rate
style, with every nrobability of drawing as, much
patronage as though it were an excellent production.
“The public wants it,” Where, then, is the need for
an excellent show —from an all-powerful combine
point of view? When there is earnest competition
between two strong rival firms, neither Of them can
afford to lose caste with the critical; but a reputa-
tion for sustained endeavor, as regards brief popular
revivals, is not necessary to a combine that has no
dangerous competitor in the trade. The house can
be filled for a week or two with unsophisticated
public; and the absence of the well-informed makes
no financial difference then or thereafter.
“X. 0.”: It is said that a dreadful doubt entered
one Sydney newspaper office by the “Business” door
the other morning—a dreadful doubt as to the
wisdom, after all, of this theatrical combine and
other such “amalgamations.” “I’ve just been think-
ing,” said the haggard boss—“supposing they cut
down their advertisements!”
The log lately submitted to the managers by the
Federated Stage Employees’ Association asks a
minimum of £5 a week of eight performances for
operators at permanent picture shows. Ushers and
spruikers for all shows ask for not less than ss. a
time. The actual work of an usher or spruiker is not
very arduous, though it entails four hours of hang-
ing around. The log price for cloak-room attend-
ants (4s. a performance) is a reminder that men’s
cloakrooms these times have no regular custodian.
Where the old order of things continues —in the
women’s -room—the attendant is vaguely _ understood
to get he? only recompense in tips ; and it is rather
less vagilely understood that she guards the room
through :many a weary night without getting a soli-
tary “tanner” or “tray.” The log prescribes 70s.
for head cleaners, 50s. for other male cleaners, and
:10s. for female cleaners. The cleaning of some
theatres is left largely to the audience, but no price
is fixed for this service. Here and there the log
may be a bit stiff ; but when everything possible has
been said in criticism of the employees’ valuations of
things, the fact remains that theatrical managers are,
on the whole, most systematic cheeseparers. Every
interruption to business means a stoppage of salaries
and wages, and a temporary cessation of profits sets
the management thinking of how to cut down exes.
Which would be more pardonable if the employees
were given a bonus every time a rotten show gets
five times the patronage it deserves.
“Theorbo”: Another opera co., Quinlan’s, is com-
ing. It reckons on getting Melba’s orchestra and
chorus after she has done with them, besides other
props. The Quinlan Syndicate is highly financial,
and already has an Australian agent. The artists
will be young and ambitious, though comparatively
unknown. There will be the Melba repertoire to
work upon, and a large selection beside, with prices
cut down by about one-half. Melba and Williamson
are perfect; but look at all that can be added:
“Barber of Seville,” “Don Giovanni,” “Figaro,”
“Valkyrie,” “Flying Dutchman,” “Tannhauser,”
“Aida,” “Trovatore,” “Lucrezia Borgia,” “Martha,”
“Maritaha,” “Bohemian Girl,” “Huguenots,” “Semi-
ramide,” “Daughter of the Regiment,” “Norma,”
■“Sonnambula,” “Freischiitz,” and so many other
glories. The Quinlans will just fling masses of
music at us, and trust to luck for the rest. But
for the present it is up to us to rise to the occasion
and give the plucky “Firm” all the support our
pockets can stand.
“Muzzy’s Man”: The following grand operas were
produced in Australia by Lyster the Great: “Aida,”
“Afncaine,” “Balls in Maschera,” “Bohemian Girl,”
“Barber of Seville,” “Carmen,” “CrispinO e la Co-
mare,” “Dinorah,” “Don Giovanni,” “Crovvn Dia-
monds,” “Daughter of the Regiment,” “Ernani,” “Eli-
sir d’Amore,” “Ebreo,” “Faust,” “Freischiitz,” “Hu-
guenots,” “lone,” “La Juive,” “La Guarany,” “Lindi
di Chamouni,” “Fra Diavolo,” “Luisa Miller,”
“Lucrezia Borgia,” “Lucia di Lammermoor,” “Lur-
line,” “Lohengrin,” “Lily of Killarnev,” “Macbeth,”
“Masaniello,” “Maritana,” “Martha,” “Matrimonio
Segreto,” “Nozze di Figaro,” “Norma,” “Oberon,”
“Pipele,” “Prophete,” “R'goletto,” “Robert le
Diable,” “Rose of Castile,” “Satanella,” “Sicilian
Vespers,” “Semiramide,” “Sonnambula,” “Trova-
tore,” “Traviata,” “Don Pasquale,” “Puritani.”
What an education besto ed on the generation be-
fore last! Did it not enrich them? And is not
the public of to-day too exigent in demanding from
Melba that the operas shall be done exactly as in
London and New York, even though there be less
than a dozen of them? Sydney and Melbourne
ought to go for the music, rather than the mighty
stars and fixings. Anyway, give me a sackful of
Cape diamonds rather than a Kohinoor.
“0.K.”: In the controversy re the art value of
slavish imitation in mummery, “Snell” scores a
point by his reference to the mimic m ‘Our Miss
Gibbs,” who looked and sounded exactly like an-
other mimic then performing in another part of the
Commonwealth. ■ I was among the pressmen who
supposed, before looking at the programme, that
Leslie Holland, remindful of Grossmith, the London
original, was identical with Langford Kirby, a pre-
vious imitator of the same comedian. The new per-
former was devoid of new effect, because he was
copying the other man’s model. There is no gleam
of personality in the performance of either comedian
if their respective imitations of a third comedian s
are indistinguishable. And how about that third
comedian’s natural rights? He may want to
come out here some day with his legitimate stock-
in-trade. If he came he would be in a worse posi-
tion than was Edward Terry when he brought his
own original creation of Dick Phenyl in Sweet
Lavender.” Frank Thornton had forestalled him
with a close imitation of his voice and mannerisms
in the same character. The public took I erry to be
t lie mimic, and rated him cheaply on that account.
The same sort of misfortune befalls some of the
music-hall singers imported by Rickards. I heir
song, make-up, voice and style have been scaled
by some pirate mimic who came before. Surely the
men who do something—however small—off their
own bat should be emulated rather than imitated.
The influence of mimicry in mummery tends to
discourage natural talent and. thoughtful work.
Slavish imitation should be for amateurs, not pio-
fessionals, in any line of art.
“Screen” : The Melbourne Cyclorama is up for sale.
It was built for the “Waterloo” panorama, which
had a good run. “Jerusalem” and Gettysbuig
followed ; but the fever was passing, and the results
from these were not so happy. The first _ boom in-
spired the building of the “Siege of Pans Cyclo-
rama in Little Collins-street. It was a terrific frost,
and has disappeared. At the opening, banlcei Turner
said, “What a splendid forgerv!” and Premier and
land-seller Patterson said: “Hundreds of acres in
the heart of Melbourne!” Yet, splendid illusion and
all, the cyclorama picture has for years been dead
as a kippered herring, and the place has had to live
on picture shows and stoushing matches, with a cold
frost mostly on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday evening's. It looks a white elephant, y t
is nothing like so hopeless as the Alexandra was
when Williamson got hold of that barn and turned
it into Her Majesty’s.
Carden Wilson, whose “imitations of people I
have seen and heard” have given joy to many Aus-
tralians, died last week, after a tough struggle, in
which he was nursed devotedly by his wife, who is
Pearl Hellmrich in the profession. The plucky lady,
while she nursed a dving husband, kept her own
turn going at the Tivoli, and if there are any benefits
going to waste she deserves one of the fattest. Wil-
son was a son of the well-known old scenic artist.
Stephen Ewart, leading man in the Ethel Irving
Co., stands 6ft. lfin. in his ordinary walking boots.
On the stage the tall fellow abbreviates himself with
diminished heels, and a bend or inclination which is
a fine little study in calisthenics.
“Gnark”: An artistic feature of Lamberti’s per-
formance is the foreign accent, which reminds one
of another tall, gentlemanly ornament of the
Rickards show, named Rudinoff. Australia has
not forgotten the handsome stranger who made
“smoke pictures” and apologised fot his Ingleesh,
as being “rude enoff.” He was understood to be a
Cockney, a la Russe, who laid aside his fancy accent
with liis fancy ' dress. Lamberti’s accent smacks of
Franco Ge-man-Italiano parentage, but he is under-
stood to be an Englishman, who learned his business
in America. Or perhans he- is a Welshman. He was
born Lambert, and his brother of that name is an
influential citizen of Cardiff.

“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Apropos the “Margaret
Catchpole” drama at the Duke of York’s Theatre
(London) recently. “The Dictionary of Natural
Biography” states that the lady was born in 1773,
and died much respected in 1841. If this be cor-
rect, we have now three ‘‘Margaret Catchpoles
the one said to have come in the Royal Admiral in
the 1790 s, the one who came in the Nile
in 1801, and the one who died in Sydney in 1841.
The lady by the Royal Admiral, an educated woman,
died at Newtown in 1855 ; the woman by the Nile,
an uneducated person, died (according to Parson
Fulton) in 1819, and was buried in St. Matthew s,
Windsor.
THE LATE CARDEN WILSON , Australian
“ Impersonator ” and Character Actor.
“Melb”: “The Silver King” again! Original
Australian cast: Nellie Denver, Annie Mayor; Olive
Skinner, Blanche Stammers; Wilfred, Titheradge;
Jaikes, Day; Ooombe, Redwood; Corker (.Duke of
New York), Phillips; Cripps, Leake; The Spider,
Carner; Baxter, Whyte; Ware, Cates; the Three
Cronies, E. Marshall, Sefton, Daniels; Pottle, Hos-
kihs. That cast was never equalled in London,
though, possibly, it may have been in America.
Silver King actors known to Australia have been
Barrett, Titheradge, Knight, Hedley, Bentley, Plim-
mer, Inglis, W. Holloway; and of Jaikeses we have
had Day, Hoskins, C. Holloway, Elton, Dodges and
Atholwood. The latest Melbourne cast figures out
better than might have been expected. Desmond
breaks away from some of our traditions. Tither-
adge was the best. Barrett had petrified by the time
he acted Denver in Australia. I remember having a
lively argument behind the scenes with Mr. and
Mrs. Rignold, both of whom championed “The Lights
o’ London” against “The Silver King.” Barrett, of
course, had starred in both plays in London, and
in both he had shown a good Saxon quality. In that
respect he compared well with the otherwise im-
measurably superior Irving, who was always of the
French school.
Richard Lee, a London dramatic critic, just dead,
at 80, made at least one sensation in his day. It was
over a long-forgotten play of Charles Reade’s, “Shilly
Shally,” which contained a line of possible double
meaning. Toole, who had to say it, did so in. italics,
so to speak, and the house chucklingly accepted it
as dreadfully improper. Lee fell foul of the author
over this; whereupon Reade —who always loved a
row —brought a libel action, and Lee’s paper, the
Morning Advertiser, was unexpectedly shot for
£5OO and expenses.
“W.F.”: “Propstick” must have dreamt he
had that copy of Bell's Life he talked about in a
recent Bulletin. The facts are still fresh in my
mind. About 50 years ago, or a little over, one
Saturday night I went to the Theatre Royal, Ballarat,
to see G. V. Brooke play “Louis XI,”, After it was
finished, Hoskins came on and announced that, on
Monday, Henry Neil Warner would appear as Oth-
ello, G. V. Brooke as lago, Rosa Dunn as Desdemona,
and Mrs. Charles Poole as Emilia. I went on Mon-
day, and, of course, the curtain rose to a crowded
house. Brooke and J. W. Bruton (Roderigo) came
on. Bruton spoke his opening lines; Brooke made
no response. Bruton whispered to Brooke, who
seemed half asleep, and stuttered out: “I am here in
the capacity of a man.” The audience tittered, and
Brooke said something about recovering himself;
then he went to sleep again, and the curtain was
dropped. Hoskins came on and said Brooke was ill.
The audience: “Drunk!” Hoskins said it was not
for him to say, and would they accept himself as
1 agoV Of course they cried “Yes!” Off he went,
and in a few minutes'the curtain rose, and the play
went off without a hitch, much to Hoskins’s credit,
his wonderful knowledge of Shakspeare pulling him
through.
From London: The inevitable burst-up iW the
picture-palace boom seems to have arrived. Pal-
aces” are putting up the shutters in all directions
in the suburbs, although in the streets around gay
and giddy Leicester Square and Piccadilly they are
still doing good business —in the evenings. In these
latter quarters, the “palaces” are freely patronised
by nymphs, who were quick to discover that a dark-
ened auditorium presents exceptional, facilities for
casual conversations and temporary acquaintance-
ships. It is well that scores of the “palaces are
closing up before some appalling disaster occurred.
Most of them should never have been licensed at all
—empty shops and warehouses quickly transformed
into places of public amusement, . without adequate
ventilation or means of escape in an emergency.
The slump did not set in a moment too soon.
Another triumph for Australia! There has been
a contest in caechination at the White City, London,
between a laughing jackass and a hyena. A bet of
£lOO a side depended on the issue. The kookaburra
belonged to the Hippodrome, and the snarling beast
to Bostock, of the famous menagerie. London Star
gives nearly a column to the affair, a member of its
staff being one of the three judges. Marks were
awarded to the row under three heads—loudness,

nevertheless the first round went to the. hyena. But
that unprepossessing beast made the mistake of not
conserving his great natural resources. All t.ie
efforts of' his trainer could not persuade him to enter
the field again. The jackass, on the other hand, was
inspired to further and prolonged laughter by the
sight of a cage of monkeys, and thus “won easily. ’
“X. 0.”: “Snell’s” band that played Gilbert and
Sullivan’s “lolanthe” borak for the Coronation films
is not a white blackbird. A few nights since I
was nearly stoushed by a pair of “push” sentimenta-
lists because I chuckled to hear “La Serenata
played like a Banshee wail as an accompaniment to
a film showing 1 an old couple starving to death. At
suburban shows the pianist is apt to play A Little
Bit Off the Ton” when the Christian martyrs are fed
to the lions. Why don’t the film-producers employ a
composer or two to provide appropriate music for
their star films —films which are now partly spoilt
by the inappropriate music that sees thorn through.

The White Man’s burden in Maoriland :
In a Chinese vegetable garden in the suburbs of

down between the rows of peas, and act as a living
scarecrow. — Wairarapa Age.

Westralia’s best-known mining warden and
police magistrate, Finnerty, is on the point
of retiring. In the early days of Coolgardie
he was the Law, and the whole Law, and
when Finnerty spoke the Full Court was
silent —anyhow, nobody ever had the teme-
rity to ask it to speak. The veteran is to
get just the sort of send-off that the big
goldfield knows how to give.
The other day the Age broke into this
shout of joy:—
It will not be long now before the Commonwealth
and State Agents are housed under one roof, an
arrangement certain to lead shortly to the unifica-
tion of the offices and the abolition of the porten-
tous positions of States’ Agents-General, as there is
now an emphatic and widespread opinion that the
existing confusion is wasting our possibilities.
But why sail under false colors? Why be
hypocrites and present ourselves as one
people when we tolerate State Frights, and
can’t even deal with a little matter of com-
mon commercial roguery without submitting
six Bills to 12 Houses of Parliament, and
taking our chance of getting them through
at great cost? It is absurd, of course, to
have all this confusing swarm of Agents in
London, hut it isn’t half so disastrous as
having this confusing swarm of Legislatures
at home.
During the last few days Sydney has
been learning more about its one and only
Cardinal than ever Dill Macky knew about
him. For one thing, it is assured that, after
all, a Cardinal need not be even a priest.
He is only, it seems, a Papal prince, and
not necessarily a great ecclesiastical digni-
tary at all; and it is recalled that Cardinal
Newman finished his life as a simple priest
subject to Bishop Ullathorne. It follows
that the prelate on the top-rung of the lad-
der in Australasia need not be a Cardinal;
so there is no question at all of appointing
a Cardinal to “succeed” the one who has
just died.
George Vernon, who was tried last year
for the murder of an old man named Neil
at Doondi (Q.) and acquitted, is alleged to
have confessed to a London paper, and then
committed suicide. Vernon’s last seven
years had been full of wild adventure. A
son of G. F. Vernon (of Bligh s Eng-
lish team of 20 years back, and subsequently
a captain of an M.C.C. side), his people
were the toniest: but young Vernon s ‘ in-
discretions” led to his family helping him
off to Canada, where he joined the Border
Police. Then he drifted to the Cape, and
finally reached Australia, and went jack-
erooing at Doondi. When standing his trial
oceans of cash were spent on him, and Feez,
K.C., and Woolcock defended him. The con-
scientious Kingsbury (Crown Prosecutor), as
well as his own counsel, was impressed with
his innocence, and probably, for that reason,
the Crown didn’t push forward all its evi-
dence, which, anyway, was purely circum-
stantial. Vernon was 25, but looked only
17, and his fresh, youthful face pfocured
him a demonstration from the crowd on his
acquittal.
“J.F.H.” (from the other side) :
It may be news to Sydneyites that the heroic
statue of Captain Cook in Hyde Park is a humbug,
a fraud, and an imposture. Cook did not care two
straws about Australia. He actually apologised to
the Admiralty for not having discovered something
valuable. His scientific companion, Sir Joseph
Banks, is the man who ought to be statued. The
life of Banks, by Edward Smith, just published in
London, makes this perfectly clear. Banks became
an enthusiast for Australia after returning to Eng-
land and settling down in Soho Square, London.
For 40 years he was the unsalaried, unofficial Agent-
General for Australia in England, and very likely
the Sydney settlement would have been abandoned
if it had not been for his continued efforts and
powerful influence at headquarters. The TikES,
in reviewing the book, says: “No less force than
Banks persistently emploved for nearly 40 years
against official ignorance and stupidity and despair
could have induced the much-worried Ministers of
George 111. to establish and maintain a costly settle-
ment at the other end of the world while their _ own
end was continually disturbed with the turmoil of
American and French revolutions and the menace
of the Napoleonic wars.” In a word, Banks was the
real “founder” of Australia.
THE DEADLY WEAPON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The hero holds the flaming boards,
Whence all but he had fled,
And on the yelling Boerish hordes
Come pressing o’er the dead.
“Come, cowards,” once again he cries,
“And see a Briton die!”
And but the booming shot replies,
And shells go howling by.
A smoking bomb falls at his feet.
He hurls, it from the fort,
And shakes the flag that none can beat,
And laughs as if in sport.
Like giant hail the cannon balls
Against the wall are slammed ;
In noble scorn the hero calls:
“Fire on, there, and be damned!”
But mark what terror seams his brow,
See how he quakes and nods,
As through the air comes spinning now
The turnip of the gods!

During the inevitable pause, Miss Simple makes
a “ slip of the tongue .”
In recently granting a decree nisi to a
husband who sued because of his wife’s mis-
conduct, but who had himself also strayed
from the path of virtue, Justice a’Beckett
(Vic.) not only capsized several ancient
legal precedents, but condescended—an ex-
.ample to learned brethren—to give sound
reasons for doing so. lie “proposed to de-
.part from the policy that held a wrongful
act a bar to divorce, because the husband
.could not be expected to live with his wife
again. The husband was of an age at which
lie might hope to marry and have children,
and by denying him the right to do so, the
Court would probably conduce to irregular
relations injurious to society.” So over-
board goes the doctrine of “clean hands” —
the stupid idea that because each party had
done something to qualify for a divorce,
therefore neither party should get it. It
was about as ridiculous as refusing to save
a man’s life by amputating his crushed
left leg because the right one was also
mangled.

The cheerful person whom a Melbourne

Why white divers in future for the Australian

It is folly to legislate against such obvious economy
as the employment of colored labor in work that is
none too remunerative, and attended by risks out of
all proportion to the reward.
Good, kind, Christian England ! Diving is
shockingly badly-paid work. Therefore, give

The Vic. Railway Commissioners receive
so much conscience money, and are so dis-
turbed in their book-keeping by -it, that they
are thinking of distributing printed forms
which the conscience-stricken person may fill
in, giving details that will enable the clerks
to “place” the original peculation. The
printed docket will, of course, be known as
the penitent form.
Victoria’s Railway Department, having
had no bad smashes for quite a month, lias
struck anew vein of fatal casualness. The
other day it left a water truck containing
two full 400-gallon tanks in an up-country
station yard, and two swaggies, coming
along after a dry and dusty tramp, sampled
the contents. The contents appeared to be
clear water, and there was nothing on the
tanks to indicate otherwise; but each tank
happened to contain arsenic, for weed-
killing purposes. One of the travellers
is now humping bluey in Elysium, while
the other hasn’t decided, at latest, whether
to follow him or stay here a while. Mean-
time, the Coroner is preparing some
weighty remarks to heave at a Department
that does fool things like that.
A member of the Melbourne Employers’

Absurd, of course. Yet people have been

1900 years ago, one, called Jesus, said it was
easier for a camel to pass through a needle’s
eye than for a rich trader to crawl into
Paradise.

J. F. Hogan writes from London :
One of the most familiar and historic of Sydney
localities has been miscalled from its infancy. Its
baptismal name is

bus made this en-
try in his jour-
nal : “The great

The S. Aus. House of Assembly keeps on
asking questions about delays in the Su-
preme Court. The latest return furnished
shows that there is nothing at all hung up
—with one horrible exception, Sexton v.
Opie, which was “reserved for judgment” by
Chief Justice Way, in September, 1909!
“The stress of work ever since has prevented
the decision of this case,” it is explained.
The C.J., who wants to have a finger
in every pie, is a member of more
Boards and Councils than a veteran
can fairly be expected to find time
for ; and the Government lately gave him a
strong hint by dropping him altogether off
the Public Library, Art Gallery, and Mu-
seum Board, of which for years he was
president.
A HALF-TOLD
TALE.
HE: “I dreamt
that I pro-
posed to a pretty
girl last night.”
SHE : “ well, go on—
what did I say?”
The cruellest spear that has been thrown
at brother Binghi for years past left G.
Reid’s hand at the Colonial Institute in
London just before the last mail left. “You
must make allowances for the Australian
black,” said Binghi’s apologist. “He had
no dense forests to arouse his latent ener-
gies, and there were no wild beasts to dis-
turb his gluttonous repose!” So now J.
Bull knows Why Binghi habitually had a
menu running to a thick and a clear soup,
two kinds of fish, a couple of entrees, a
brace of roasts, two sorts of ripe cheese and
wines en suite, and thus gradually accom-
plished a girth of 82 inches. Had there
been wild beasts to nose in at the feast, and
tread on the victuals, Binghi would have
been compelled to run his palace on the
quick-lunch and counter-s'nack principle,
and he might then have been as
lean and haggard as Houston Greid.
But it was his misfortune that the ichthyo-
saurus was dead and the dinosaur remained
only as a fossil, so the poor wretch became
a glutton, who never had his repose dis-
turbed, and in the end a dreadful High Com-
missioner, who never had a decent meal in
his life, and couldn’t be reposeful if he
wanted to, looked back and threw clods at
him.
A SPARTAN.
GENTLE BUSHY (sarcastically): “ Pretty brisk

There is no mention of the variety of fruit;

it be trusted that the elderly Adam hasn’t
apples on his mind.
The vastly intelligent system, whereby the
flood of N. S. Wales products is directed
towards the bottie : neck of Sydney, became
unusually distracted recently, as the result
of a miscalculation on the part of the city
commission agents. Gambling on a dry
Spring, they had purposely held supplies at
country sidings with the object of giving
prices a leg-up; but when it became appar-
ent that the Spring wasn’t going to be a
party to the proceedings, a spurt was made
to clear the sidings and rush everything to
Darling Harbor. Although the season was
slack—with the fruit, grain and wool traffic
absent —the extra quantity of pumpkins and
the unusual amount of spud were unable to
crowd down the bottle simultaneously, and
hurried messages were sent north, south and
west to stop loading at country stations for
more than three days a week. In the middle
of the storm of abuse, protest and gibbering
rage from merchants, agents, cockies and
others, came the triumphant word that the
new line of railway between Maitland and
Dungog was open for traffic and ready to
empty a contribution into the congestion.
At latest information, decentralisation was
galloping to the front like a wooden horse.
“J. Shay” : This is the sea-
son when the Schools of Arts
are in evidence. As usual,
the bulk of the reports show
great artistic activity in novel-
reading, smoke-room yarning,
Dilliards, chess and draughts,
with the usual amount of bick-
ering among subscribers and
committee members thrown in.
It would be a good thing if the
Government, which heavily
subsidises these places, burnt
the novels, sold the billiard
tables, disinfected the smoke-
rooms, and referred the check-
ers players to the nearest asy-
lum. The buildings Could then
be devoted to relieving the con-
gestion in primary schools, and
to continuation and technical
school purposes ; and, as a side
line, they might be used as
gymnasiums, training halls and
staff offices for national-defence
uurposes. The private enter-
prise pub. and book-shop could
then cater well enough for novel-reading,
billiards and the other arts.
The strenuous “Jimmie Pannikin,” who
is a N.S.W. school-inspector when he has
his office clothes on, has pushed another
iron in the fire. Many of the school grounds
are now being planted with trees, and he
wants to know now why they
some of them, anyway—be fruit trees, His
idea is that, while the fruit wouldn't do the
youngsters any harm (presuming it was left
long enough on the vegetables), the school
plantation might incite the neighborhood to
dig a few holes and put in a few trees'" round
its own humpies, to the advantage, of its
pocket and the good of its health.
SONG OF LOST SUPPERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Launceston, Monday.-—The ketch L. 11. Burden,
which was • stranded at Flinders Island about six
days ago, is likely to become a total wreck. The
vessel was loaded with crayfish.— News item.
The bright red fish with the armored back that stirs
on the marble slab,
Or crawls about in search of sea on the roof of the
homing cab ;
The diffident, well-boiled, crimson food which waggles
protesting palms,
And acts (though very reluctantly) as the hoozer’s
coat-of-arms:
All these are prisoners doomed to die, poor prisoners
of the town—
The Dago’s clear cash-register bell
Has rung in the night their careless knell!
But there’s a different tale to tell
When the fisherman’s ketch goes down.
Now, how many drunks will weep to-night and moan
on the shadowed quay /■
For armored food that crawls about on the floor of
the sounding sea?
The hold was a tangled mass of claws as she sailed
the wintry sea;
And the captain feared —-as a captain might—a cray-
fish mutiny ;
But all went well till the vessel struck; then the
seamen fled the wreck;
The cargo stirred in an awful way —The suppers
crawled up on deck!
Oh, yes, that cargo seethed and boiled till the wreck
was a heaving dome!
The drunks may weep on the shadowed quay,
But every fish got off scot free;
Down in the depths of the winter sea
Are the prisoners crawling home.
The silent, salt, Imperial cray for the soak hath
many charms;
But not this time will these fresh fish act as the
dipso’s coat-of-arms l

“Vagabond”: I don’t see why “Chasuble”

make a fuss about a parson inventing a
little thing like a hat-rack under church
seats. It isn’t as though he’d invented an
adjustable cushion or pillow, so that a man
cbuld lean back and think comfortably and
not too loudly during the sermon! And
“invented” a hat-rack —great Hamlet, aren’t
these inventions in scores of theatres all over

halls where they have another invention—
a neat little shelf, designed to hold a bottle

get something of the sort installed, and ar-
range a proper supply of the necessary
liquid, and supply a neat little rubber tube
attachment that could be fixed to the bottle,
he would fill a long-felt want. Also, inci-
dentally, he would fill his church.

Of all the Coronation slobber in the
London papers—and there was, on the
whole, less there than in the Australian
papers—the most slobberiy was a column
in the Chronicle by C. Brunsden Flet-
cher, associate editor of the Sydney Morn-
ing Herald, which might have been passed
if it hadn’t been headed “An Australian
View.” C. Brunsden Fletcher dipped his
pen in tears, and began this way:—
“God Save the King!” I have seen the crown
actually placed upon the King’s head, and have
heard the acclaim ot his people. I have also been a
witness to the anointing and crowning of the Queen,
and have cried with the multitude for her safety.
Then he asks himself how it is that the
spectacle has moved him so —him from the
Commonwealth, which “is supposed to lack
reverence, and to think little of robes and
rubrics.” And he explains why
I had seen the King and shaken hands with him
before reaching the Abbey. A great deal of my
emotion at the Coronation came because in Aus-
tralia I had held the hand of the King in mine.
That settled it! Brunsden Fletcher had
touched the King’s hand, and, after that,
when the King .was crowned he “felt that
it was all necessary, fitting and right.” In-
cidentally, the Man Who Touched the
King’s Hand mentions that “we were cooped
in a dark, dirty gallery, and the only
glimpses which visitors like myself could
get were obtained by craning forward at the
risk of life and limb. 1 had to hang on to
iron bars,” he says, “and hug the dust of
grimy pillars until I was foul.” Still, on
reconsideration, Brunsden Fletcher, refers
to it all as “a solemn ceremony in so appro-
priate a setting” Well, Mr. Fletcher no
doubt knows what his surroundings should
have been, in order to make everything ap-
propriate ; and as everything was appro-
priate, he was evidently in his right place.
Still, wouldn’t something in the way of a
nice, damp cellar have been better than a
dusty, grimy gallery V

The N. S. Wales Marine Court, having
pondered over the circumstances of a colli-
sion between a Manly ferry boat and a col-
lier, which had been anchored in Sydney
Harbor’s fairway during a fog, has decided
that, as both navigators were slavishly fol-
lowing the regulations for preventing colli-
sions, the act of bumping can be blamed to
nobody excepting Providence. And as Provi-
dence can’t have its certificate cancelled, nor
be fined five bob and costs, the matter ends
there. If the judgment is any good at all,
it means that a crowded ferry can anchor
in the fairway and be walked over by an
ocean giant feeling its way up or down the
harbor through a peasoup fog. In that case,
nobody would be held to blame, and the
corpses would have to pay for their own
cofiins. What is wanted is the suspension
of these British-framed collision-preventing
regulations, which did not anticipate crowded
water thoroughfares like Sydney Harbor, and
the substitution of special regulations to
meet local requirements. The Harbor
Trust has power to do this, and it is the
common-sense thing to do. There are rude
people who will say that that is probably
why it has not been done.
A few days asm, a Chow named Wong
Low called at one of Victoria’s marriage
shops with a girl of 17. The parson said
to the girl: “Were you 21 years old last
birthday?” and of course the girl said “Yes.”
So the Chow was handed a young white
girl, and the parson got his fee; and no
doubt both were satisfied. The irony of the
business is that one of the three principals
is being tried for participating in the horri-
ble business. A sane person would natur-
ally suppose that it would be either the
Chow or the parson. Nbt at all. It is the
17-year-old girl who is being tried for “mak-
ing a false declaration.” This parson con-
fessed to marrying about 400 couples during
the year, so it looks as though it’s his living;
and the sooner the job is turned over to a
State-salaried registrar whose bread-and-
butter does not depend upon hitching young
white girls to yellow abominations the bet-
ter. That sort of official would have shooed
Wong Low off the premises if that horror
had dared to come to him. Most likely the
Chow wouldn’t have dared.
Has the Britisher lost all his national
pride? The last notable to visit the Com-
monwealth —Sir John Kirk, of the London
Ragged School Onion —boasts that his insti-
tution has 130 depots for relieving starving
families in the slums of London. This may
mean anything from 25,000 to 50,000 people
dependent on one institution in London for
the bare necessaries of life. The absence of
crowds from the Coronation show was pro-
bably due to the fact that about half London
was too naked and ashamed, or two weak
from hunger, to turn out and help to add to
the glorious pageant.

The S. M. Herald says that Cardinal
Moran “identified himself with the social
and industrial progress of the land.” Which
no doubt means that he favored the Labor
policy. It is a. fairly correct statement of
the case. The organ of the Cardinal took
upon itself, at a critical time, to stampede
the R.O. electors out of the Labor ranks,
prompted thereto by a disgruntled Laborite.
When Pope Leo XIII. issued his famous en-
cyclical letter on Socialism, a Consecrated
Press writer proclaimed that it bound the
Ronjan Catholics in Australia to leave the
Labor party or be attainted outcasts. The
Cardinal’s organ foolishly supported this at-
titude. The rival Catholic journal in Syd-
ney, however, pointed out that the Papal
announcement was ex cathedra, and not
binding on the consciences of those who took
their views from Rome. Moreover, it quoted
another encyclical letter of the same Pope
in support of Australian Labor principles.
This declared that “any free, self-governing
community could make whatever laws it
pleased for the welfare of its people, pro-
vided always it did no injustice to any
man.” The following Sunday the Cardinal
spoke out plainly. He said the organ that
had attacked Labor had done excellent ser-
vice for the Church, but in this case it had
made a serious error. The Pope’s pronounce-
ment did not apply to the peaceful, lawful
reforms of the Australian Labor party.
Thereafter the editorials of the consecrated
organ were supervised.

The Annandale (Sydney) municipal coun-
cil has won round one in a fight to “out”
the fiends who blister the landscape wth re-
marks concerning corsets, pills and other
confectionery. The referee, who is a magis-
trate by occupation, was asked to decide
whether an ordinance prohibiting the adver-
tisement eye-sore on a “wall” had been
broken when it appeared on the side of a
brick house. He promptly said it had, and
charged the bill-poster £2 for the informa-
tion. Round two will be fought in the
Sunerior Stadium.
Touching a historic estate : —•
Announced that A’ale Head, Molong (N.S.AAL), an
estate of 2000 acres, has been sold by Mr. H. C.
Betts to Mr. Robert Bruce, of Cumnock. The
transaction revives some old memories. Vale Head
was one of the first Crown grants. It is a fine pro-
perty, on the right bank of the Molong rivulet (a
stream having its source at the ba.se of the Canoblas
Range, near Orange), and was originally vested in
the Rev. Samuel Marsden, parson and magistrate, of
Parramatta. Vale Head itself is an eminence over-
looking Molong and a charming valley, with willows
cooling the waters of the rivulet, while on the oppo-
site elevations are remarkable outcrops of limestone.
(“Molong” is native for “stone”.) What was once the
main western road, that leading to the old-time
convict settlement of Wellington, trailed by Vale
Head. Here the Rev. Samuel depastured sheep, and
he built a big octagonal house on the height. That
quaint caboose was rented by Thomas Cobden, a
brother of Richard Cobden, the Corn Law repealer
and contemporary of John Bright. Thomas Cobden
secured a liquor license —the first issued beyond
Bathurst —and the octagonal dwelling was the resort,
of travellers, teamsters, shepherds and others. Oh
the estate is a graveyard where sleep many pioneers
of a vast territory. There rest the bones of the
Cobden’s bonifacial brother. Thomas Cobden left a
large family, and it would be interesting to know
the number and whereabouts of his descendants.
The sons were “thorough, colonials” —that is, they
were daring horsemen, expert bushmen and adven-
turous spirits. Among the first managers of the
pastoral property was John Smith (afterwards
M.L.C., and owner of many station properties in the
vicinity of Molong). Mr. Smith occupied a cottage,
embedded in a garden and orchard, near the bank of
the rivulet, and in this cottage was born his eldest
son, the first native of Molong—Fergus Jago Smith,
M.L.C. To-day there are but few traces of the
cottage. The garden and fruit-trees have long dis-
appeared. On the opposite bank is the snug town
of Molong of to-day. Vale Head eventually passed
to Henry Samuel Marsden Betts, a descendant of the
grantee. Mr. Betts married a daughter of Captain
Finch, and reared a large family. On his death
Vale Head passed to his son, Mr. Henry C. Betts:
and now, after the lapse of nearly a century, the
estate leaves the Marsden descendants. The pur-
chaser, Mr. Robert Bruce, springs from another
pioneer family. The late George Bruce, of Loombahi,
won world-first prizes for champion wool.

The Fitzroy (Melb.)
Bench has decided that,
although love’s offerings
are irreclaimable as re-
gards jewellery and
works of art, a sewing-
machine is devoid of
sentimental signi-
ficance. A jilted saw-
miller, suing a dress-
maker for the return of
the things he gave her
when they were “en-
gaged,” was awarded the'
sewing machine without
costs, whilst the lady
was left in possession of
a ring, gold bangle and I
two paintings. The
magistrates seem to>
have drawn an invidious:
distinction. Bings andl
bangles are as much:
implements of trade foir
a young spinster as the
machine wherewith she
stitches the figleaves of
modern fashion. And
the two oil paintings!
The lovesick swain prac-
tically gave them to his
intended bride as fur-
nishings of the home
where he hoped to be so
happy. Now that the
lost jewellery is enhanc-
ing Angelina’s charms
in the eyes of the other
fellow, the baffled suitor
will have visions of
those pictures hanging
on the wall of —Oh,

“Lex” : Tt is signifi-
cant that the Melbourne
lawyer who persisted in
appearing for a number
of damaged clients at
the inquiry into the"
cause of Tait’s last
grand smash has got in-
to trouble with the-
Powers concerning his;
management of one of
his many railway-accir-
dent cases. This solici-
tor's bill may have been excessive; mostt
solicitors’ bills are. But most solicitors’ex-
cessive bills are not attacked, whereas this;
solicitor’s bill is, and it would be interest-
ing to know whether it would have been had
the lawyer refrained from making himself
disagreeable while the Government was
adopting underhand, and in some instances
intimidatory, methods of “squaring” claims
for compensation. The Full Court decision
won’t touch that aspect of the case; but it
is one wrnll worth touching. If lawyers are
to be punished for sticking to their clients
when the Government is on the other side,
the door will be opened to admit a lot of un-
pleasant things.
THE SPITTING BRIGADE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They set up a sign in the street,
They set up a sign in the train,
And on it was writ:
“PLEASE DO NOT SPIT!”
But the Notice was printed in vain!
From spitting they would not refrain,
For to spit is to prove you are “free” :
Dick, Harry and Tom
Simply spit with aplomb
From the station to Circular Quay!
Spit! Spit! Spit!
In ferry, in carriage, in tram—
They spit with a will,
And they’re spattering still,
For they don’t give a tuppenny darn.
All night it had steadily rained,
The city was clean as a pin;
In the clear, morning light
All the pavements shone bright,
As the people came hurrying in
The work of the day to begin.
It was really a pleasure to sit
And look at them, bustling,
And cheerily hustling—
Till somebody started to spit!
Spit! Spit! Spit!
In spite of the sign, often seen,
Which they held in derision,
And spat with precision
AVherever the pavement was clean !
All day was the city defiled.
Each tram was a moving spittoon,
While the pavement was made
By the Spitting Brigade
To look like a viscid lagoon.
They spat upon dresses and shoon,
On passage, and stairway, and floor;
And they gathered at lunch
In a “fag”-smoldng bunch,
And started to salivate more.
Spit! Spit! Spit!
At factory, office, and shop,
They smoked and they chattered,
And copiously spattered,
And nobody told them to stop !
Arise, O Lord Mayor, in thy wrath !
Arise, stern Commissioner, too!
And turn mild requests
Into haughty behests
To awe the contemptuous crew,
Who spit if they talk, smoke or chew,
Who spit just to show they are “free” —
Tom, Harry and Dick,
AVho make everyone side
From Redfern to Circular Quay!
(With their) Spit! Spit! Spit!
Give heed, 0 ye Powers, to this rhyme!
Make a merciless raid
On the Spitting Brigade,
And fine them a fiver a time !

HE WANTED THE FREEHOLD.
DOSSER : “ Could yer give a bloke the price of

KIND OLD GENT (fingering his money): “How
much'll it cost?"
DOSSER (more hopeftd): “Well, a new un 'd
be expensive: but I can get a real good
second-hand one fer 'arf a quid."
“H.S.M. : Can anybody better this, and
speak the truth ? I have an old mare who has had
11 foals (five fillies and six gentlemen). The five
fillies have between them 20 foals and three grand-
children, making a gross total of 35. All but four
are alive and working. Nobody can cast doubts on
this in my presence and remain healthy.
“A.F.”: Re death of “Wild Wright” (B.
3/8/’11), just a little recollection of that notorious
man in his prime. He gloried then in the name
of Isaiah, and weighed 12 stone, mostly bone. He
made a meteoric appearance at Yanko station just
before shearing started in August, ’69. There were
about 50 men in the hut as he stalked in, and an-
nounced himself: “Hogan’s ghost 1 Is there any
flash man here?” No response. “I’m Isaiah, the
prophet, and I’ll ride, reap, or rastle him for a
quid!” Modest silence. “I’ll fight him for a belly-
ful.” There were no takers; and when he tweaked
Big Mick by the nose, Mick responded with a weakly
smile, as if having his beak tweaked in public was
one of the most humorous things. However, Isaiah’s
prowess did not go untested. There was a black
“rig” in the paddock that no one had tackled suc-
cessfully, and next morning he was yarded by
Scotty Turnbull, the head groom. Not a seat was
vacant on the stockyard rails as Wild Wright
mounted, in moleskins and heavy-nailed boots. Most
expected to see him half killed, and Scotty smiled
appreciatively, but withheld judgment. For a few
seconds there was a wild whirl; the “rig” plunged,
reared, bucked, and bit all he knew; and then, solid
as a rock, Wild Wright started a series of yells,
bashed the animal over the head with his hat, kicked
him in 50 places, and finally handed him back to
the admiring Scotty, an exhausted, broken and
humble animal. There was no more fight in him
than there had been in the 50 shearers the day be-
fore. That night Bob Wilson arrived. Now, Robert
was a flash man, if you like —cabbage-tree hat, Bed-
ford cord pants fitting like a glove, and red silk
sash; and, besides having a considerable reputation
as a rider, “Flash Bob” had appeared in the ring a
few times. He would take that bumptious young
man down a peg! “Pooh! He may be strong,” he
said; “but he’s got no science.” So, at Sunday
breakfast, as Wright reached out for the brownie,
Wilson snatched it from his hand across the table.
“After your betters,” he said, insultingly. There
was no explanation on either side. Rising slowly
and calmly, Wright said “Come on,” and on the
level plain, where you could see the horizon half-way
round, with the creek gums for a background, they
faced one another. Flash Bob stripped to the buff,
a well-made, muscular man, in the pink of con-
dition; Wright, in shirt, moleskins and bluchers, as
he had ridden the “rig” the day before, made no
preparation, but stood with one arm awkwardly in
front of him like a semaphore. There were only two
blows struck, worth , mentioning; and Bob got both
of them. It took water from the creek to bring him
to after the second, and he was not comforted for
weeks. Shearers and rouseabouts went back to the
hut and played euchre till dinner-time, satisfied that
an edifying Sunday morning had been spent. Wild
Wright did not shear at Yanko that year (nor, in-
deed, any other year), as the super thought him a
bit too strenuous to have about the place.
* * * *
“Stingaree” : Here’s another “Yorky” yarn
that isn’t in.. Banfield’s, “Confessions. of a Beach-
comber.” Yorky ' had his beche-de-mer camp on
Hook Island, one of the Whitsunday Group. In his
employ was an aboriginal named Tommy, very skil-
ful in finding the favorite haunts of the sea-slug.
One afternoon Tommy left to look for bSche-de-
mer. When he did not return by night, Yorky be-
came anxious, and went in search. After walking
along the beach for several hours he gave up and re-
turned to camp. Next morning he was up at day-
light, and, the tide being out, he made for the reef.
After. walking over the coral boulders and splashing
through weed-infested pools, he came upon the dead
body of the blackfellow, with one leg imprisoned
within a big clam shell. Tommy had evidently
stepped into the open clam the preceding afternoon,
and when it closed on his leg he was unable to
escape, and was drowned by the rising tide. When
he told me the story, Yorky said the clam shell
fish was about the most dangerous of all the creatures
to be found on coral reefs. They lie wide open in
pools, and are often completely hidden by seaweed.
On one occasion the one-armed marvel had the sole
of his boot torn off by the springing of one of the
animal rat-traps that he happened to tread into on
a half-submerged reef.'

“Denys” : Tried the effect of music on a
gohanna. When I assailed him, he . had in his pos-
session a discarded' 31b. piece of beef. I got my
flute, and cautiously sat down within about 4ft.
He seemed appreciative from the first note/ dropped
his bundle and posed like a duck looking down the
neck of a bottle. His long, sinuous tongue shot in
and out like a magic piston; no doubt he was
greedily licking in the melodious strains of “The
Minstrel Boy.” His eyes scintillated and flashed
like miniature search-lights, and he showed real
affection for “Annie Laurie” and other sweet things.
The fright stayed the time out. Then he attached
the meat to his head, raised it on high, brought his
ultima-thule to the “Present! ” and the pageant
moved. Haven’t seen him since.
* * * *
“Wyn de Wiff”: I herewith lodge an
appeal against the decision of “Mr. Justice Ocky”
that venomous snakes do not climb, on the
ground that it is in direct opposition to
the evidence accepted by the learned Judge
in the case of “Landlord v. Adam and Eve,”
an application for permission to cancel free-
hold selection for non-fulfilment of conditions. In
that case, which your Honor will find reported in
Genesis Law Reports, page 9, the defendant .Eve, in
her affidavit referring to the apple, deposed that “the
serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.” As your Honor
is well aware that there were no fruit-shops at the
time, the said serpent, who was joined as a party
to the proceedings, must have obtained the means
of beguilement by climbing. If that is clear to your
Honor, I will not pursue the point, except to ask
for costs on the highest scale.
* * * *
“Ivory”: I agree with “Kuru” that bad
water has a lot to answer for when beri-beri is about,
but that rice is a factor has yet to be proved. I
have never been able to find evidence that too much
vegetable fobd of any kind is responsible. In the
camp of nearly every drover who brings stock from
the Territory into Queensland there is a case or two
of the disease. I know, because I have worked across
the Territory behind cattle, and had it. Its preval-
ence there certainly isn’t due to too much vegetable.
At nearly every camp, however, the water varies con-
siderably in quality, and the lime and other reprehen-
sible minerals in the springs probably do the mis-
chief. In mild cases, scurvy-grass, steeped in a billy
of boiling water, is good medicine; also it is useful
as a preventive. Potatoes and vinegar are a sure
cure, if the thing hasn’t gone too far. Cut the
spuds up raw, and make a salad of them with the
vinegar, or else boil them in the vinegar, and I’ll
guarantee they’ll shift the beri. Plenty of milk is
also helpful, and so are citrous fruits.
NECESSITY KNOWS NO LAW.
BAPTIST PARSON : “ Surely ALL the Baptists in the district haven't turned Methodists?"
MALLEE COCKY : “ Yer see, the boys an' gals growed up, an' the drought kept on, an'
th! irrigation didn't come, so we fist HAD TER.”
“Quidam”: As an old hand among the
vegetable porcupine, I don’t think much of
“C.R.W.’s” suggestion (8.3/8/’ll) that ostrich farm-
ing might have a beneficial effect on the prickly-
pear country of Queensland, as the birds could be
largely fed on chopped pear-plant. There would have
to be about 40 million ostriches to destroy the present
supply of pear; and by the time Bananaland had
accumulated that many of the poultry, the pear
would be in a position to demand more; and by the
time the pear was exterminated, the market for
ostrich feathers would be busted. Apropos of vari-
ous creatures’ appetites for prickly pear, in drought
time goats and dairy cattle develop a partiality for
it, so logic might suggest another big drought as an
exterminator. As a matter of fact, every dairyman
who carts pear to his cattle generally plants as
much as he helps to destroy, per medium of
leaves, etc., dropped en route, and every bird that
eats the fruit assists in distributing the pest by
scattering the seeds. There is, in truth, no easy,
ostrichy way of wiping out the pear. It is a matter
requiring hard thinking and harder work and pro-
fanity. The profanity isn’t absolutely essential, but
it is absolutely inevitable.
“Berkeley” : The “vegetable caterpillar”
mentioned by “Jack Jay” (B. 27/7/’Il) is fre-
quently found in N. S. Wales and Vic. (and probably
elsewhere in Australia), generally in moist, thickly-
timbered country. Am inclined to question “J. J.’s”
statement that the spores of a fungus settle on the
grub. A more likely theory is that the caterpillar,
while feeding, swallows the spores of the fungus.
These germinate inside the grub, and the fungus
pushes forth a stem at the back of the head. The
unfortunate caterpillar is generally found upright in
the ground.
AT CROSS PURPOSES.
RUDE BOY: “Say, Mister, why don't yer take
yer legs down a right-of-way an' let 'em
fight it out? ”
“Condamine”: “Smell” (B. 20/7/’ll) ex-
aggerates his steeplechasing adder’s performance
when he credits it with a seven yards jump—unless
it was down a shaft. The adder can certainly spring
in the manner described, but my own observations,
backed by the evidence of those who have had a
life’s acquaintance with the reptile, show that four
feet would be a long jump. Also, an adder is so
lively with his business-end, which isn’t the tail-end,
that one could easily bite “Smell’s” dog without
“Smell” seeing the performance.
SIGNS OF SPRING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
For years I watched The Bulletin
About the time that Springs begin,
In hope of rushing in an ode
Ere other bards blocked up the road.
In vain! I always found, instead,
A rival bard had got ahead.
So this year I sat down and plotted
How to get in ahead. I jotted
Several delightful, airy things,
Compound of all I know of Springs,
Down upon paper. “For,” thought I,
If I write Spring up in July,
I’ll give the others the go-by.”
Foresight most rare I showed in this ;
I wrote the Ode — and here it is I
How do we know it is Spring?
Spring In the city so bleak?
Hark to the band playing “GOr’save the King!”
Sales are commencing this week !
Pubs are being painted bright red,
Quite in a literal sense;
Even the Dagoes say Winter is dead—
Crayfish are up eighteenpence 1
How do we know it is Spring?
Isn’t the wind from the West,
Bearing sweet odors of Botany ling—
Odors we sniff at with zest?
Look at the shows in the shops!
Feel the keen edge of the air!
Watch the almighty and dignified cops
Chasing the Chow from his lair!
How do we know it is Spring?
Doesn’t it buzz in the blood?
Look at the sun with his eye in a sling
Trying to dry up the mud !
Mark the glad grocer at work,
Tying up salts with some string.
Getting up early continues to irk—
That is a sure sign of Spring!
Spring ? I should say it was Spring!
Look at the girl in the skirt;
Hobble they call it —and how does it cling!
Wouldn’t you think it would hurt?
What an astonishing hat!
Delicate primrose and pink;
What is it trimmed with on top, where it’s flat ?
Pickled nasturtiums, I think.
How do we know it is Spring ?
These are infallible signs!
Into The Bulletin basket they fling
Thousands and thousands of lines—
Tender, unfledged little odes,
Trifles that verge upon tears.
Monsters! But usage, like acid, corrodes —
They’ve been rejecting for yearsl
How do we know it is Spring,
Spring in the country so fair?
Bull-ants have started to sting—
Stingees have started to swear!
Cows have relented at last,
Letting down milk by the pail;
Look at the grass growing fast!
Look at our old cock’s new tail!
Fanners are rising at four —
Last month they roused out at five—-
Cow-slaves may slumber no more:
“Now, then, yous blanks! Look alive!”
Staggering out in the dark,
Bucket and dipper they bring;
Gracious ! What language—-just hark !
Everything says it is Spring!

PARADISE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I think I want to go to Paradise,
Not for the sake of harping all day long,
Or lifting up my voice in happy song,
But chiefly to sit down where Peter plies
His job, and hear the old hands swapping lies.
Yes, I could loaf for aeons by the door
Or in the little lodge-room where St. Pete
Is hobbling in and out with gouty feet,
Admitting some to tread the golden floor,
But sending others downwards one stage more.
The energetic push can make a din
With concerts and processions and the rest;
But as for me, I think it will be best
A comfy nook in Peter’s house to win,
And sit for ever watching trains come in;
And meet old pals, and shake them by the hand,
Or give a “hoy” as they go farther down,
Hearing small gossip of my own old town—
Who keeps the pub? Who’s Mayor? You under-
stand !
No harping, but such loafing would be grand.
Around the gate where Peter holds hi§ court
The idle chaps of Paradise will flock,
Waiting to hear some well-known cobber knock,
And all eternity won’t spoil that sport
So long as the tobacco don’t run short.

Many friends in England, to view the Coronation
procession, arose at 3 a.m. In the dark, some lost
their way ; others arrived too late ; all were exposed
to weather inclemencies. We in Australia, however,
may choose our own time, an enjoyable seat and view
the procession at several vantage points. Cinemato-

will be thankful for improvements affecting cheap

“Kodak” at sea:—
Ihe Sj r l was a nice girl, and her escort was
decently attired, except for his socks, which were a
violent and exasperating green, and his boots, which
were a raw red. They were so red that they seemed
to be prevented from bleeding only by their coating
of glassy polish. The red-booter and the girl occu-

the Man with the Lobster tramped across the gang-

he stood stock still in front of them, his gaze riveted
on the scarlet feet. The pair talked on as if nothing
was about to happen.
“Wha’s th’ matter with yer feet?” gulped the
Usher of the Pink Fish very’ gravely and sympatheti-
cally. Of course he got no answer. But that didn’t

temper somehow.
The Usher of the Pink Fish, triumphantly leering,
made an unfortunate mistake. He mistook one of
hm victim’s feet for his supper, and, seizing it,
started to wrap it up. There was a curse, a
scuffle, and the pink fish, propelled by a boot like
a gun flash, whizzed through the draughty gangway
passage into the black sea. For a second the drunk
was too overcome to act. Then he ran at the en-
gineer, waving his arms. “Lobster overboard!” he
sobbed. The engineer—a sad man, like a despondent
walrus—looked at him stonily without speaking.
The drunk recoiled helplessly from that awful look,
and, staggering to the side, stared distractedly back
into the dark where his one ewe lobster was drown-

“Phil Harum” : “C.0.D.” (B. 3/8/’ll)
tells only half the story of the virtues of the ger-
anium as a snakebane. He forgot to mention that
it is as effective against imaginary serpents as it
is against the wriggling realities. If “C.0.D.” is in-
clined to doubt this, let him try a decoction of the
plant next time he has the jim-jams. He will be
able to furnish some interesting reading afterwards,
The stalks, crushed and applied in the form of a
poultice, also form a sovereign remedy for bursting
head. If all its virtues were as widely known as
they should be, there wouldn’t be any geranium left
to scare away the real snakes.

PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
“Puketapu”: It was at the hour when
Dusk spreads her soft rug for the coming of Night
that I blundered across an apparently long-lost
whare on the East Coast of Maoriland. It was a
lonely place, with that distinctive feeling of death
about it which some deserted places have. It didn’t
take me long to see that here had been a pa. at one
time, and the remains of the huge old Maori ovens
set me wise to the death-feeling. Perhaps it was be-
cause I had lost myself that I was nervous; perhaps
it was the cold, hungry swish of the sea along
the darkened beach that wore on my nerves. Doesn’t
matter; I managed to get to sleep. It must have
been a couple of hours later, when an almost naked
Maori warrior walked into the hut and called me to
follow him. Massive and grim he strode towards the
ovens near the beach, with me at his heels; and as
we topped a sand-rise I saw a sight that stayed the
flow of blood in my veins. A war party had returned
with a canoe-load of prisoners, and these doomed
wretches, were being butchered and gutted like
sheep—brained where they stood helpless by breath-
hissin'g, blood-splashed demons, and put into the ovens.
Already some had begun the feast, squatting round
the smoking banquet of corpse, hacking at it and
tearing it with their dogs’ teeth. One who bit at
an underdone foot had the blood running down his
jaw. And all the time they laughed and jested, and
threw bones or scraps of unchewable sinew at each
other, like so many devils kicked out of Sheol as
incurable. Then an awful sickness swept over me, and
I dropped. It was bright day when I came round, and
everything was the same as on the previous evening,
except that, instead of waking inside the hut where I
had gone to sleep, I was lying on my face near an
oven, and the fresh marks of a canoe that had been
hauled upon the beach were where I expected to find
them.
“Little Plain”: “Ah” (B. 27/7/T1) asks
why any old tin used instead of the orthodox billy
is called a “Whiteley King” ? During the big
shearers’ strike the “free” laborers, sent by Whiteley
and Co., to take the place of the shearers on strike,
almost invariably sported an old treacle pot, or some
similar makeshift thing, presumably from motives of
economy. Also, any particularly despicable sort of
a swag, composed of pieces of bag, discolored calico,
etc., is widely honored by that same illustrious name,
and for • the same reason.
* * * *
“Billy Bluegum” : It is only in the trap-
per-infested localities that the fox is decried as the
pastoralist’s enemy. In many of the western
(N.S.W.) districts the bonus on fox scalps has been
discontinued, as there is ample proof that Reynard
is Bunny’s natural enemy, not on account of the
number he eats, but because his tactics lend them-
selves tb the cannibalistic proclivities of the buck
rabbit. Instinctively alive to this weakness in Pa,
the doe excavates a shallow dug-out,- some distance
from home, in which she conceals her young, keep-
ing the entrance carefully closed during her absence,
till the kittens are able to shift for themselves. Here
they easily fall a prey to the keen-scented fox. The
doe has thus been driven to make the parental roof-
tree her lying-in hospital; but she is no better off, as
few, if any, of the babies escape the buck. The fox
will not trouble sheep to any appreciable extent
while rabbits are plentiful; but when they become
scarce —well, he is more easily got rid of than the
rabbit. By the way, he does not live up to his Old
World reputation for cunning, as he is more easily
poisoned than any of our native animals. His tail
is built into the wrong end of him, for it’s his
brains that are most in need of a brush.
* * * *
“The Pariali”: Re “Wang’s” bet (B.
27/7/’ll) that there is no harder Australian wood
than the black wattle to cut in a dry state. Has
“Wang” ever met the fiddle-stick blackwood ? When I
first went to the survey camps, the assistant told me
to cut two pegs out of a stump he pointed out. At
the first collision about half the axe-head flew into the
next State, and for 10 minutes I couldn’t be pt?r-
suaded that I hadn’t got into an electric battery.
Beach Forest (Vic.) has a yarn that Alcoclc’s tried
some of its fiddleback for a billiard table. It says
something for the grit of Australian workmen that
the table was made; but every tool introduced to the
wood agate was chipped out of recognition. Still, I
must say this for it; if there is any Victorian wood
that takes a higher polish, or presents a finer surface,
I would like to make its acquaintance.
“Altair”: Re “Jack Jay” and the vege-
table caterpillar. This member of the Fusion party
exists in Australia and a lot of other places. I
have found stray specimens here in Central Queens-
land, but they were not so large as the Maoriland
samples. The mature form of the grub is a wi-nged
insect, and it is widely distributed, as Darwin dis-
covered most flying creatures to be. Presumably the
moth carries the fungus spores, or at least the fun-
goid diathesis, with it, and thus propagates and
spreads the vegetable half of the Fusion.
* * * *
“Picton”: Takes a lot to disturb William
Wagtail. Last year a couple built their nest on a
wire stay attached to the chimney of an open school
shed, and the lady with the oscillating rudder dis-
charged her maternal duties in public, without ex-
hibiting a blush, while her partner filled in his time
making periodic assaults upon a magpie that had
thoughtlessly elected to build in the vicinity. One
night, just about the time when the lady was “ex-
pecting,” a cyclone wandered into the shed, lost its
bearings, and distributed half the roof throughout
the district. Next morning I was surprised to
find the nest, and more surprised to discover no
traces of excitement in the parent birds. The
gentleman apparently attributed the whole business
to a frolic on the part of the magpie, and was busy
organising himself into a punitive expedition, while
bis missus merely expressed a few regrets that Social-
ism was spreading. The subsequent repairs to the
roofing iron raised a din like the National Debt
falling off Kosciusko, but the parties with the vi-
bratory steering gear never ceased in their atten-
tions to the offspring, which were reared and fed in
the daily presence of a constant stream of inquisitive
children.
MULDOON : “Come on, Briggs, an’ I'll knock the divil out o' ye!"
BRIGGS: “ Orright; you hot me coat."
“F.C.”: So “Wang” (B. 27/7/T1) thinks
black wattle the hardest Australian wood to cut, dry.
Well, I’ve got a few black wattles in my paddock,
and I mostly get light exercise Sunday mornings by
cutting up a tree or two for the week’s firewood. I
won’t bet “Wang” drinks, but if he happens along,
I’ll lay him where I lay other suburban swaggies : —•
on to a slab of yellow box, about the size of a boy.
This grew near here (Melbourne suburbs), and sup-
ported a neighbor’s tank for two decades. The
splinter has broken two axes and the hearts of
several travellers who thoughtlessly tackled it; and
I would dearly love to get “Wang” on to it.
“Nell Cook:” “Wee MacGregor” (B.
27/7/’ll) wants to know why dogs delight to roll
in anything particularly stinksome. Pride! Dirty,
snobbish pride! The animal has no joy in fine
clothes, to call forth the envy of his fellows; gold
is no use to him; meat is his only wealth. So he
rolls in the stale article to convince the other dogs
that he has so much tucker that it is valueless in
his eyes, and he can afford to roll in it. From the
circumstance of dogs doing this, arose the old
expression, “stinking pride.” Anyone may notice
the supercilious airs of the dog thus anointed, and
the crushed expression of others that have not been
lucky enough to meet with the odoriferous patch.
» * * *
“FeTicer” : Can arrive at only one opinion,
after reading the statement of “Salt Beef and
Spuds” that bloodwood and stringybark are not
long-lasting—-he is raw. Practically every fence on
the Tweed (N.S.W.) is either bloodwood or red
stringy; and some of them are older than the
Oldest Inhabitant. Moreover, the former wood does
not burn freely, and fire will not touch the latter
with a long flame. Finally, white ants rarely do
business with either of them. As for the advice to
use teak for fencing—well, with that timber at 17s.
per 100 superficial feet, what do you think? “Salt
Beef and Spuds” ought to get back to his restaurant.
“Eddyson” : This is a story of Pat Macka-
boy’s. Pat had descended to manual labor in a weak
moment, and was scratching mullock in the Old Hoss
for 7s. 6d. a shift. Going home one morning, after
night-shift, he fell upon a marauder mauling his
belongings in the hut. The intruder had a blanket
spread on the floor, and in it was an .assortment of
Pat’s valuables. The hut-breaker was a lean, fair-
to-middling, 12st. blackguard, with a broken nose
and a vivacious eye. When Mackaboy fell in upon
him, he made no demonstration, offered no apology.
“This lets me out,” he said, and sat down on the
bunk. “No,” said Patrick, “it lets you in. Seven
months is the minimum.” “Sorry to put you to
so much trouble,” said the man. Mackaboy recol-
lected that a trial would mean great aggravation.
“See here,” he said, “you can have 3'our choice: I
get to you, or whistle up a cop.” The man on the
bunk was prompt. “Get to me,” he said. He took
it like a lamb ; right and left for the jaw, a rip, and
a hearty kick by way of stern admonition. Then
Pat went cold on it. He found it dull work pasting
an impassive resister. “Don’t stint yourself,” sa'd
the cheerful burglar. “Have another turn.” “It isn’t in
me,” Mackaboy replied. “Scoot! Get over the hill."
The party with the googly nose thanked Pat politely
for a square deal, and took the direct route for else-
where. Two months later Patrick Mackaboy went
up to Launceston to see the State champion smothered
in three rounds by Six-finger Rigg. That battle
impressed Patrick profoundly. . The winner was a
man-eater, and P. Mackaboy recognised him at once
as the broken-nosed hero of the hut.

“Australia! - ”: Caterpillars have been
making things lively on the Northern railway tracks
in S. Aus., especially, on the Broken Hill line, be-
tween Petersburg and Cockburn, where trains have
been held up daily. Even the express has been
delayed for hours by the crawlers; and, in a des-
perate struggle to keep the rails clear, engine-drivers
have been fixing stable brooms, bottle envelopes, and
other queer devices on to the cow-catchers.
* * * *
“A.G.E.” : I can give both “Quidam” (B-
-8/G/’IX) and “Hecagus” (B. 6/7/’ll) a better recip°
for scaring cockatoos from a corn patch, or galah-
from a wheat field. Dissolve some strychnine in
pure vinegar or acetic acid, which will take about
10 minutes; then pour boiling water on.it. Ds-
tribute loz. to a bushel. This saves trouble for
everybody but the visitors.
* * * *
“Mosgiel” : Saw a strange case of foster-
parentage some time ago which may interest other:?
as much as it did me. Was stopping at, a hou>e
where one of the inmates was a small fox-terrier
pup, taken from his mother weeks too early ; another
inmate was a Manx cat. The cat. whose name va?
Bill, gave birth to five kittens, two of which were
promptly drowned. Bill thereupon accidentally, or
by design, lay on the other three and smother-?
them. After waiting long enough to be sure of their
deadness, she adopted the pup. For five weeks she was
all to that pup that a mother should be. Then an-
other pup, visiting ours, explained that cats were
possessed of devils, and illustrated the manner o
casting them out. Between them they nearly kilk
Bill; and after that the pup could get nothin?
better than water with his lunch.

Apropos the branch business which Henry
Parkes founded in 1850 at Geelong- (Vic.)
for the sale of “billiard and bagatelle balls,
humming tops, children’s rattles, etc.” (B.
17/8/T1). Parkes’s manager was Angus
Mackay, who afterwards became proprietor
of the Bendigo Advertiser and Minister of
Mines. It was the same Angus who
founded the Sydney Daily Telegraph, hop-
ing to make a strong Protectionist paper of
it. But he burned his fingers, and flew
back to his comfortable Bendigo property.
A recent visitor to these parts is John
Cox, for over 20 years a science professor at
the great McGill University in Canada. He
has retired on a pension, and, aided by the
Carnegie millions, is employing his leisure
in travel among the world’s universities. He
finds those of Australia so surprisingly up
to date that he probably wonders why they
go to third-rate European universities for
their teaching staffs. Talking of radium,
the retired professor admits that, so far, its
discovery has not resulted in anything very
tangible, except as a possible cure in some
cases of superficial cancer, though not very
much is known about even that.
Victoria’s Acting-Premier Willie Watt,
the man who is coming, made a sort of pil-
grimage the other day to his birthplace—
Barfold, 10 miles from Kyneton. The cot-
tage in which he was born has gone, and
only a solitary poplar marks the little
estate. Willie was the youngest of 11 chil-
dren.
William Jeans, who was an Argus re-
porter from 1865 to 1569, but then went
back to the English Parliamentary Gallery,
has just retired after being for some
years the Father of the Gallery. The
Argus twice obtained conspicuous men
from London as reporters. The first time it
got Aspinall and C. A. Smyth, barristers,
who soon took to the Bar. Jeans belonged
to a second little batch.
John Foster Fraser is the Parliamentary
sketch-writer for the London Standard.
and during the recess he always goes to some
outlandish place to collect material for a
book and a lecture. Australia was the dark
and inaccessible spot he favored last year.
This year he went with a camel caravan to
the Sahara regions behind Morocco, Algiers,
and Tunis. The inevitable book is to be
called “The Land of the Veiled Women.”
John Cash, one-time sergeant in the old
43rd Regiment of the line, answered the
roll-call at Pambula (N.S.W.) a few days
days back. lie saw service during long-
ago troubles in suffering Erin ; pursued Ram
Dham during the Mutiny; met that first-
class fighting man, the Zulu, in his most
aggressive mood; and exchanged discourte-
sies with the Maori before settling down to
cultivate peace and other products in N. S.
Wales.
G. R. Nichols, of St. Mary’s (N.S.W.),
who has been appointed hon. librarian to
the Pioneers’ Club, is a grandson of Isaac
Nichols, first gazetted postmaster of Syd-
ney. Isaac was a clerk to “Campbell of the
Wharf” when he was given the job by
Lieut.-Goveruor Foveaux in April, 1809.
Governor Macquarie confirmed him in the
appointment in June, 1810. The post office
was at Mr. Nichols’s own residence in Lower
George-street, just about where the fire-sta-
tion now stands. He was paid at per
letter.
“The Undersigned”: Premier Verran’s re-
cent mention of Judas Iscariot and some
comments thereupon remind me of an
episode that occurred in the Melb.
City Court 20 years or so ago. when
a Syrian who swore that Judas Is-
cariot was his name was charged with
hawking without a license. Call,
P.M., fined him 30s. (the usual fine
in those days was much less). Judas’s
solicitor produced two
coins, and sent someone
out for change. On the
return of the messenger,
the lawyer walked over
to the clerk’s desk and
slapped dbwn 30 single
shillings, which closed
the incident. I looked
next day for some in-
dignant comment upon
the profane comedy, but
none was. forthcoming,
and the pious Melbourne
Daily Telegraph was
alive in those times, too.
On Partridge Island
—a lone, bleak speck
down the Channel in
Southern Tasmania— :
there live a couple who
follow life’s procession
with indifference. They
are the only humans on
the island, and civilisa-
tion means a long sail
for them. Sometimes the
husband varies the mon-
otony by taking on a bit
of timber-lumping at one
of the Huon ports, and
then the missus looks
after the billows of the
Antarctic by herself. If
she goes short of any
victuals, she hoists sail
and beats her way over
to some small port, picks
up her packet of pins
„ , , and turnips, and is then
off home to her lonely castle.
A pressman’s farewell:—
.Patrick Francis Moran, who hung his Cardinal’s
ha.t on the Peg of Eternity last week, was a good
friend to pressmen in more ways than one. He was
a never-ending source of good “copy,” and about
the only public man (for he was a public man)
outside leading Federal or State Ministers that a
chief-of-staff would never take a risk with. A body-
guard of pressmen followed him wherever he went,
and if they didn’t get something to flavor the
public’s breakfast coffee next morning, things could
be counted slack. Nothing pleased him better than
to be interviewed on a “hot” subject, but it was
not easy to pass the barriers that hedged him
‘Your Eminence,” said a scribbler to him on one
occasion, “there are times when I must see you or
suffer m office reputation, so if I bring a shot-gun
with me next time, and leave a trail of the slaugh-
tered behind me till I reach this room, I hope you’ll
understand that the exigencies of dfity are the cause
and that no ill-will is intended.” The great Church-
man laughed softly in that happy manner lie had of
eipoying a joke with his whole body, and that press-
man s name was thenceforward put “on the doors,”
so to speak. The old gentleman’s one grievance was
against the nressman who misreported him ; but the
remarkable thing is that he was not more frequently
“taken” inaccurately. During the past few vears, it
was often almost impossible to hear him distinctly,
unless quite close to him, and time and again daily-
paper men were saved trouble by the notes of the
reporters for the Catholic weeklies, whose ears by
constant practice, were tuned to the modulations of
his voice. He will be missed bv the ink-slingers
and last Saturday, when I passed through the crowds
before the Cathedral, where his body lay, all undis-
turbed by the sobbing of the muffled bell above him,
I saluted a lost friend of the craft.

Buried with military honors in Adelaide,
Pierce Purcell, who went through the In-
dian Mutiny, settled in Melbourne, volun-
teered for the Maori wars and had three
years of them, and then joined the Maori-
land constabulary. His favorite recollec-
tion was the chase of the “flying column’’
after Te Kooti —a procession which lasted
for months.
The only unkind thing so far said about
Lady Denman by Society writers appeared
in the dear old Australasian. Lady Den-
man went to see “Lady Frederick,” and the
writer who gushed over her Ex.’s clothes,
etc., remarked that her hair was “beauti-
fully-colored,” which was a cruel thing to
say of an Excellency whose thatch is above
suspicion.
Tom Gill, S. Australia’s Under-Treasurer,
is the least spectacular and about the most
useful of its public officials. He runs a big-
banking business —for on the security of
Treasury bonds there are millions invested
with the Government—and he also keeps
every Treasurer on the straight and
narrow path. As a side line, he looks after
the finances of the Municipal Tramway
Trust for the State, which advanced over a
million to buy out the horse-trams and instal
electricity. Likewise he is the authority on
the early history of S.A., and has written
several books on the subject, and he is now
producing a biography of Colonel Light, the
founder of Adelaide. His bibliography of
S.A. —now, unfortunately, 25 years out of
date —is the only thing of its kind attempted
in the State.
After pondering the matter, and consider-
ing whether Sol Bloom should be stopped
from becoming a member of the Victorian
Lawyers’ Union because lie had honestly
earned something towards his keep while he
was qualifying, the Full Court decided to let
Bloom blossom into a wig. A successful
N. S. Wales practitioner had a similar nar-
row escape. He had earned his board bill
by fluting or something in a paid orchestra,
and one learned Judge, who had got a hint
of it, asked whether the applicant hadn’t
been guilty of earning money. “Yes. that
is so, your Honor,” said his ready godfather ;
he went as a private to the Soudan, and
earned great distinction as well as a little
pay.” After that exhibition of the appli-
cant’s “patriotism”—well, how could a
Judge pursue the matter any further?
His Australian experiences changed many
of Cardinal Moran’s views. Thus, when he
was Bishop of Ossory, he was regarded in
Ireland as an opponent of Home Rule —he
had been reared in the reactionary political
cult of his uncle, Cardinal Cullen, of Dublin.
It was not until the Cardinal had
thoroughly experienced the blessing of self-
government in Australia that he adopted
the same principle for Ireland. A reference
to this -was once made by Acting-Premier
Holman at a Patrick’s Day celebration in
Sydney. Commenting on the great advance
ot the Home Rule cause, Holman made the
sensational statement that even the chair-
man (the Cardinal) had been converted to
Home Rule. The Cardinal demurred, but
Mr. Holman quoted an article written by
the Cardinal in the Nineteenth Century,
Thereafter, it was arranged to do away with
impromptu speeches at the festival, and an
invitation is now sent to one public man to
deliver a prepared address.
“Tamaso” on an ancient dispute:
“Oldest Inhabitant” (B. 10/8/’ll) evidently has
the impression that Margaret Catchpole and' Mrs.
Reiby were one and the same person. Such was not
the case. The former came out in the ship Nile and
the latter in the British Admiral •
Mrs Reiby’s name then was Marv
Haydock. Margaret Catchpole was
never married, nor had she any
children. She died in 1819 on the
banks of the Hawkesbury, where she
kept a little shop. She was buried
in Richmond churchyard, as can
be verified by the register of
St. Peter’s Church, where it is
distinctly stated she was a single
woman. Cobbold, in his book, shows
that he had the same impression with
regard to Margaret and Mrs. Reibv
being identical; he thought she hail
married her old sweetheart Barrv,
and had adopted a thin disguise by
ehanging the name to Reiby. Mar-
garet wrote to the Cobbold familv
regularly up to the time of her death.
She also sent a case of Australian
bird-skins to the Rev. Mr. Cobbold ;
he had them stuffed, and presented
them to the Norwich Museum. When
the Cobbolds heard from Margaret
no more, they made some sort of en-
quiries, from which they were led to
believe she was Mrs. Reiby, and a
wealthy woman. As a matter of fact,
she was then dead ; hence her silence.
On the assumption that Margaret had
become Mrs. Reiby, and did not wish
to further communicate with him.
Mr. Cobbold was pretty rough on her
in his book. There is little doubt
this book was the original cause of
the two women being so generally
regarded as one. Years ago the mat-
ter was debated in the papers, and
those who maintained that Mrs.
Reiby and Margaret .Catchpole were
identical wished to make evidence
out of the fact that Mrs. Reiby had
many descendants in Sydney, some of
them in the highest positions, and
not one of thorn had contradicted
the assertion. They had a very valid
reason for not doing so, which I will
not mention here. Finally, Margaret
Catchpole was old enough to be Mrs.
Reiby’s mother.
Councillor W. R. Cooper, the municipal
G.O.M. of Victoria, is retiring from the
oversight of drains and dead-dogs at the end
of his present term. The old gentleman,
who sits for a Fitzroy ward, is within a few
weeks of 80, and his experience of roads and
bridges and parish pumps dates back to 1856,
when he represented the McArthur ward in
the municipality of Melbourne. Later he
went into the country and did some muni-
cipal pioneering, but a boom in building
brought him back to Melbourne, where lie
tirade a tidv pile. The municipal fever runs
in the veins of the Coopers. This one’s
father was a member of the Lambeth Coun
cil in the foggy township, and there are
other relatives who have been mayors and
thinvs in the Cold Country.

The widow of the late P. N. Russell,

leaves a third of her estate to Dr. Barnado’s
homes, another third to the Church Army,
and the balance to a sister. Her late hus-
band, Peter Nicol Russell, handsomely en-
dowed the Engineering school of Sydney Uni-

shattered, that his widow would recognise
his interest in the University when dispos-

THE NEW DEVIL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
1 dreamed to-night the Devil came
And sat beside my bed —
Not like the thing the churches shame,
Nor garbed in flaming red,
But clad in black,
And, set well back,
A topper on his head.
No lank and hollow cheek had he,
No cloven hoof nor horn,
And on his linen, I could see,
No trace of soot was borne.
A great big paunch,
A mighty haunch,
His body did adorn.
He fixed me with a piggish eye,
And talked an hour or so —
Was glad, he said, that rents were high,
And wages still were low;
He yarned of meat,
And wool and wheat,
And wheezed, and would not go.
Then clearly I remembered him,
And cursed him where he sat;
I knew him by each portly limb,
His bright and shining hat.
“Great Scot, ’tis true,
If giv’n his due
The Devil then is Fat?”
He chuckled with convulsive glee,
And chortled: “That is so.
The whole of Hell belongs to me;
Nick borrowed on the show,
And was deposed
When I foreclosed
A hundred years ago ! ”

When the Melbourne land boom was on the point of
bursting, this co. had £250,000 of paid capital, and
it owed £994 764 on debentures. Practically all
of this had been advanced against landed properties
at boom valuations. When the bubble broke the
securities were thrown on to the co.’s hands whole-
sale. There was no hope of selling them at their
book values; in other words, there was no hope of
getting 20s. in the £, though the co. was expected
to hand its creditors their full pound of flesh. In
the circumstances the shareholders had to face a
dreary prospect of calls. The co. at the time was
in 250,000 shares of £5, paid to £1 ; and share-
holders thus carried a liability of £1,000,000.
First, two calls of £1 each were made, under
arrangement with the debenture-holders, and then
another of 10s., also in consideration of the deben-
ture-holders keeping the bailiff out of the premises.
Unfortunately, many shareholders couldn’t play the
game of back up or forfeit, so, of the original
250,000 shares, only 145,770 are now alive—-the other
104,230 have been forfeited. On the whole lot
£2 10s. has been written off, and that and the re-
purchase of debentures at a discount has allowed a
deal of writing-down to be done; and at the written-
down values, so many sales have been made that to-
day all the and other debts have been
paid off. Moreover, things have improved so much
since the last writing-down that in the aggregate
the subsequent sales have shown a surplus. While
there were any debentures outstanding this surplus
had to be held as a contingency or guarantee fund.
Now, however, that the shareholders are quite free,
it has been decided to cut up the accumulated profit.
There is 6s. per share of this money available ; and
with it goes back to the shareholders 2s. per share
of capital. From this it looks as though the co.
has given up all idea of having a second time on
earth as a new-business concern.
The following comparison shows the position now
and as it was when the last reconstruction was
agreed to: —
Liabilities.
1907. 1911/
Capital £113,567 £142,688
Debentures .. .. 318,703 Nil

Assets.
Advances .. .. 298,629 88,538
Properties .. .. 124.579 40,774
Cash, etc 38,798 62,705
For the most part the advances are money outstand-
ing on properties sold on terms—and mostly, it
seems, not on very long terms. The first table shows
what surplus has been realised on the sales. Further,
some provision apart from the contingency fund be-
fore mentioned has been made for doubtful debts;
the extent of this provision is, however, not known.-
There may be a trifle to come to the shareholders
on this account. On the other hand, there is no
certainty that the £40,774 of property in hand will
fetch £40,774. If it does, and if the other assets
(advances, etc.) are worth just their book value,
then the capital is, of course, intact; that is to say,
the £1 paid share is worth £l, plus its proportion
of the £49,320 of reserves, or, together, a penny or
so under £1 7s. per share. (This is before the dis-
tribution to be made this month.) But, obviously,
after the distribution, £1 worth of shares (book
value) won’t be worth £1 present value, since no
dividend is being paid. Still, the discount shouldn’t
be large, because some profit is being earned. I-n
appraising the true value of the shares, the un-
known quantities are-—(1) the money that the sedi-
ment of unsold assets will bring in; (2) the time
that shareholders will be out of their money pending
the realisation of the last asset. But no doubt money
will be cut up as it becomes available —that is, as-
suming that liquidation has been fully determined
upon.

This co. has been doino- exceedingly well during the
past 18 months. Of course the general prosperity of
the city has had a great deal to do with it. But
improved management and organisation has been an
important factor; for, after all, General Prosperity
isn’t a Santa Claus warrior who goes round dropping
money into your pockets—you at least have to hold
out your hand to grab it. Also, the co. dashed into
the catering business at a time when that line be-
came unprecedentedly profitable in Sydney. And
there isn’t a business in which management counts
for more than in this of food-supply; the profits
the good manager makes are the waste that the bad
manager permits. Further, the meat-export trade
has been large, on account of thq good seasons and
the big surplus of stock ; and that means good profits
for this co.’s refrigerating branch. Finally, this co.
is a big ice-maker, and the ice-makers arrived at
an honorable understanding some time ago, where-
upon the usual thing happened with regard to price.
These various things explain the much bigger profit.
And they also suggest that drought and bad times
would shrivel up the profits considerably. As the
table shows, the co. had a revaluation of assets
about seven years ago, and, in order to make assets
and liabilities balance, it had to write off £118,293
of capital and reserves. Things in Australia weren’t
bright when that valuation was made, and no doubt
there was a subsequent recovery in many of the
assets. That gave the co. a good start; it meant
perhaps that the eo. hasn’t written off revenue to
cover depreciation as vigorously as it would other-
wise have had to do. Still, there can be no ques-
tion about the progress having been very solid. This
shows it better:—

Liabilities .. . . 31,188 16,410 23,432
Surplus . . £11,079 £48,470 £50,595
That means that in the seven years since ' ie clean-
ing-up, the co. has (1) paid its steadily- creasing
dividends, (2) paid for all repairs, rent Us and
additions to plant, and (3) put by £39,516 1 liquid
assets,. which are more than half b.ank dep its and
Government stock. Whether the general -precia-
tion of plant has been fully counterbalance! by the
amount spent on plant renewals and additions there
is no way of telling; but, in view of the business
extensions of the past few years, it would lie sur-
prising if more has not been spent than would cover
the decline in value. The figures therefore look
exceedingly good; they show that profits could
slump very much, and still very comfortably pai"
the average dividend of the past seven years. In
fact, the amount added to the surplus of liquid assets
is equal to an average 6 p.c. per annum on the
capital, making, with the average dividend paid, a
total of over 134 p.c. p.a.

Boom, boom, boomj The Bananaland Government
is borrowing hard, and most of the money it is bor-
rowing it is putting into railways and railway plant;
and that’s where this co. comes in. Moreover, when
the Government borrows and lashes out, most pri-
vate people are borrowing (if they can) and also
lashing out; and this co. comes in there too. And it
isn’t all borrowing, of course. The State has had a
succession of wonderful pastoral seasons; and
the sugar business has been flourishing. Also,
though Queensland hasn’t been doing anything
extraordinary in a mining way, it has been
spending a lot of money on plant—at Mount
Morgan, at Cloncurry, on the Etheridge and
elsewhere. All this, too, has played right into the
hands of this old-established engineering co.—this and
the more reasonable duty imposed nowadays on such
goods as _ the co. produces. It has, however, been
too long in the business to expect to go on showing
such figures. In 12 years under the Queensland
State tariff it paid a total of 41 p.c., equal to only
£3 Bs. 4d. p.c. p.a., and in 10 years under the
Commonwealth tariffs it has paid in all 24 p.c.,
equal to a miserable £2 Bs. p.c. p.a.; and, though
it may expect to do better now, it has a lot of lee-
way to make up before its shareholders reach a fair
average. Moreover, though the tariff may be more
reasonable now, prosperity is very liable to come bv
fits and starts—it always is that way with construc-
tional activity. So the wise man won’t build much
on the boom profit of the past year. The co. has
throughout been very prudently handled, by the look
of things; when it was doing poorly it dropped its
dividend rather than not provide for depreciation.
That is to say, it didn’t scatter its doubtful profits
and then go to the bank for money to pay for plant
repairs and renewals. Consequently its financial
position is very sound; before paying the current
dividend it had £75,476 in liquid assets, including
over £45,000 in cash and “invested funds,” and its
total liabilities were £15,267. It is thus in an ex-
cellent position to meet the demands which are
sure to arise for more plant; it can finance its jobs
without paying dearly for the accommodation ; and it
can meet any ordinary contingency with as much
cheerfulness as almost anj r manufacturing concern in
Australia.

There is no law in Maoriland to stop a co. from
combining the trustee and investment business; and
investment in such a case nearly always means specu-
lation. This co., for instance, has liabilities (mostly
deposits) amounting to £182,773, and practically
the \yhole of that amount is out on mortgage• the
capital and reserves are represented by freeholds and
leaseholds and Corporation and Harbor Board deben-
tures. Mortgages are shrinkable securities; but, no
matter how much they shrink, this alleged trustee
co. is expected to repay the depositors 20s. in the
£. Thus capital which ought to be available for
the protection of the beneficiaries under trusts may
be wholly absorbed in meeting losses made in the
loan and mortgage business. It need not be sug-
gested that a co. with trust funds in hand would
ever apply them improperly, supposing it found
itself pinched by a sudden slump in the property
market, followed by a sudden demand on the part
of depositors for their money. But a co. never
ought to be able to get into a position where such
a thing was even possible. This co. should either
drop the trustee business altogether, or pass the
branch on to some other concern ; and simultane-
ously the law should make it illegal for any co. doing
trustee work to raise money by deposits or other-
wise for the purpose of loaning it out again. As
previously remarked, the co. has liabilities amount-
ing to £182,773, including £165,465 of deposits.
The liquid assets (bank balance and cash in hand)
total £1354 ; probably the Corporation and Harbor
Board debentures (£22,939) should be included,
though these things are only more or less liquid.
The cash position is therefore wretchedlv weak;
evidently the co. leans its full weight upon some
bank, and the favor of a bank is a doubtful stick
to put one’s full weight on.

The activity in the Sydney property market is
i making this old-established co.’s figures look good;
and, though the dividend has been again put up a
point, the big deficit is being whittled down fam-
ously. Originally, when the business founded by
the two ex-bank managers was sold to this co., the
latter paid £57,500 for the goodwill; that is to
say, of the £60,000 of capital, all but £2500 was
represented by nothing that you could touch, or
smell, or taste, or see, except with the eye of Faith.
That was just upon 23 years ago. The management
prudently set to work to replace this paper asset by
something more substantial; and, though the ac-
cumulation has been slow, it is growing like a snow-
ball, not only because of the better business, but be-
cause there is now over £50,000 in liquid assets
earning interest —which means (say) £IBOO a
year to go towards increasing the profit and wiping
out the deficit. At the present rate of progress, the
deficit will have entirely disappeared in three or four
years; and then the capital will be all represented
by liquid or tangible assets. They will presumably
earn from 34 to 4 p.c. ; so, even though the profit
from ordinary business should shrink —as it is bound
to do when the present property boom eases —a
comfortable dividend should be assured, assuming, of
course, that the funds are safely invested.

This co. is only just holding its own on a 4 p.c. basis.
As the table shows, the total amount added to re-
serves in seven years is a trifling £2298; and it is
even then doubtful whether enough has been written-
off to provide against current wear and tear and
decay. That is a point, however, about which no-
thing definite can be said. One thing that has to be
remembered is that the co., whose own capital is
£50,000, owes £36,865 on debentures; and though
the property represented by the debenture money is
no doubt depreciating just as fast as the rest, the
debt remains as good as new. In five years the total
liabilities have been reduced only from £39,356 to
£38,007, and the liquid assets haven’t been in-
creased worth mentioning. The co.’s trouble is
cheap electrical competition, municipally-owned, and
that is likely to increase and become keener rather
than otherwise. It is very sad for the shareholders,
no doubt; but the vastly greater number of the
public look at the matter from quite another point
of view. The fact is that the publicly-owned body
is, doing as well as it wants to do when it makes 4
p.c. net; therefore it reduces the selling price of its
goods, or whatever it has to supply, when more than
4 p.c. net is shown consistently. But the private
concern thinks it is only just beginning to make a
living when it makes 4 p.c. And the investor who
doesn’t remember that fact when he cuts into some-
thing that is liable to public competition, has less
regard for his widow than he mostly thinks he has
for his wife.

Two and a-half years ago this co. went on strike against
an award of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court,
and shut up its mine for two years. There may,
however, have been method in its madness. It had
found what looks like the bottom of the mine in
the north end, and, though there was still a con-
siderable quantity of ore left in the south end, ad-
joining Block 10, the co. couldn’t afford to use it
up rapidly. _ For this reason: it had just decided to
go into business in a large way as a purchaser and
smelter of other cos.’ ore; and it is very dangerous
for a co. to attempt that business unless it has a
good reserve of ore of its own on which it can draw
if outside supplies run short. If it must buy or
shut up, the chances are that those who have stuff
to sell will be able to extract a price that may leave
very little profit for the smelter. Moreover, metal
prices were poor; so, taking one thing with another,
the directors decided to close the mine, and they
kept it closed for two years. It was only in Feb-
ruary of this year that they re-opened it, and then
only on day shift. When a mine works only one
shift, the administration and other standing charges
are, of course, heavy in proportion to ore extracted;
on the other hand, men simply cannot do good work
in a stope where toil goes on all round the clock —
the air never gets a chance to become even fairly
pure. _ The increased gross profit for the past half-
year is no doubt the result of this partial resump-
tion of mining. But naturally the co. doesn’t show
what part of the profit came from its own ore, and
what from the purchased ore. The aggregate out-
turn of lead and silver was as follows:—
Lead —-Tons. Silver —Oz.
Nov., ’lO .. . . 44,554 .. 2,688,800
May, ’ll .. . . 39,509 . . 2,307,014
Thus the increased profit was achieved in the face
of a shrinkage in the output; and that seems to
show that the co. has made a very good profit by
resuming the mining of its own ore.
The co. really carries on three businesses. (1)
It mines its own ore. (2) It is a purchaser of silver-
lead concentrates for smelting. (3) It produces
large quantities of zinc concentrates and has latterly
gone into the business of zinc-smelting, which (ex-
cept for a little done by the Sulphide Corporation)
is anew and most important industry for Australia.
From the co.’s own ore a first crop of silver-lead
concentrates is extracted. The tailings are then
either put through the silver-lead mill again (most
of the old tailings are treated that way) or sent to
the zinc concentrating mill. At this concentrating
mill in the past half-year 178,125 tons of the resi-
dues produced 44,110 tons of zinc concentrates,
assaying 44.88 p.c. zinc, 6.95 p.c. lead, and 12.860 z.
silver. This product is still mostly exported to
foreign_ zinc-smelters; but the co.’s own plant at
Port Pirie (S.A.) is being gradually extended. Last
half-year, 665 tons of spelter and 100 tons of blue
powder (zinc dust) were produced. General-manager
Delprat says that, though the initial difficulties have
been many, “they have now been overcome, and the
results obtained in costs and recovery compare with
the best results obtained in Europe”—which, by
the way, isn’t very definite.
The spelter plant has been very expensive ; though
something has been written off it, it still stands in
the books at £86,000, and that is apart from the
roasting and acid-making plant. On the zinc-
smelter plant alone just about £IOO,OOO has been
spent. This amount was provided out of the Reserve
Fund ( £225,000), and it is now proposed to gradu-
ally repay the fund out of cash profits. This may
mean that the dividends won’t be quite as large as
the growth of the profits might lead shareholders to
expect. The financial position is strong, notwith-
standing the big demands made for new plant. A
comparison with the position five years ago follows:

May, 1911 .. 884,542 404,635 479)907
the ,P ast Aye years the co. has paid £984,000 in
divs., has put in a vast quantity of machinery
etc., and still has drawn upon its liquid resources
to the extent of only £51,540. It is a wonderfully
fine record. And in the past six months the co’
while paying a Is. div. and adding much more plant’
has poured £i0,119 into its liquid reserves. Wh c.’i
is a wonderfully good record too.
This paper isn’t a prophet, and, therefore, savs
little about the future, since that future depends
very largely on the uncertain metal markets. ‘ No-
body knows what may happen as to zinc, though the
appearances and reports are very hopeful; while as to»
lead the prospects are distinctly good. And as to the
mine, the last estimate of reserves gave it 2 750 000
tons above the bottom workings; and the develop-
ments in the neighboring Block 10 strongly suggest
that there it still a considerable quantity below those
bottom workings—in other words, that’ the ore-bodv
isn t dipping away so flat as had been thought.

Besides the reserves shown in the table, there is
£15,000 to the credit of a contingency fund. This
amount was put by in 1910, and is shown as written-
on , and that partly accounts for the larger sums
thus disposed of in those two half-years. The
amount might, however, be perhaps quite as fairly
reckoned in with the reserves; for it is understood
to be a fund to protect the co. in case it should
overdraw against consignments. These cos. mostly
get advances against their output, subject to a final
adjustment (say) three months after delivery; and
if there should be a bad slump in metal prices with-
in the three months, they may have a good deal of
refunding to do. As to the financial position, these
changes have occurred

Liquid assets .. £27,697 £127,413 £130,992
Liabilities.. .. 4,375 13,127 15,210
Surplus .. £23,322 £114,286 £115,782
In the past six months the co. has paid its £52,500
in divs., spent £8439 in plant, and added £1496
to its liquid surplus. As the plant stands in the books
at £113,100, and as wear and tear is rapid, it is
certain that the surplus in excess of the dividends
was not large enough to provide for fair deprecia-
tion. In other words, the very big dividend paid
was not fully earned.
The gross profit for the past half-year was derived
mainly from the current output of silver-lead con-
centrates and zinc tailings, but a certain amount
also apparently came from a deposit paid on the
sale of the old slime dump. Probably the latter
amount was about eoual to the value of the slimes
produced in the half-year. If so, the £62,201 of
gross profit may be taken as the gross profit from
the half-year’s output. The output was 128,272
tons ; so the gross profit was equal to 9s. Bd. per ton,
out of which, of course, depreciation—renewal of
plant, etc. —has to be provided. The ore reserves
above the 1100 ft. level are estimated at 1,500,000
tons; and the gross profit on that lot at 9s. Bd. per
ton would be £725,000. But the plant will swallow
a good deal of that in repairs and renewals, and
there are a hundred other holes in a mine for gross
profit to fall into. As against that, however, has to
be put the fact that the present surplus of liquid
assets over liabilities is £115,782, and there is also
a big dump of old slimes—-90,000 tons—lately sold
at 7s. 6d. per ton, on which only a deposit has so
far been paid. And there is also the ore below
1100 ft. The lode has been pierced in what is called
the 1250 ft. crosscut; but it certainly is not safe to
rely upon any great quantity of ore below that point.
It is more likely not to be there than to be there.
There are 175,000 shares in the co. ; and the market
values them at about £5 10s. =: £962,500—a good
deal more than the £725,000, which is the amount
of the gross profit on the ore above 1100 ft., assum-
ing that last half-year’s profit is maintained through-
out. But it is all a matter of speculation. A pound
more or less per ton for lead on the whole lead con-
tents would mean about £200,000 difference in the
profits ; and in the past 10 years lead has averaged
as much as £2O Bs. loa. in one half-year, and as
little as £ll 4s. 6d. in another.
The Broken Hill North mill is doing extraordinarily
fine work; it is very doubtful whether any other
lead mill in the world beats it, though the B. H.
South isn’t far behind. Its concentrates contain
76.8 p.c. of the lead and 54.8 p.c. of the silver;
and there is only 8 p.c. of the zinc left in the con-
centrate. The product is divided into four sections
—concentrates, coarse tailings, zincy tailings, and
slimes. The coarse tailings—practically the tailings
—represent SO p.c. of the total tonnage, and assay
only 2.6 p.c. lead, 2oz. silver and 7.8 p.c. zinc. In
the zinc product no less than 68 p.c. of the zinc is
collected. Certainly, the Sulphide Corporation re-
covers as much as 93 p.c. of its lead; but that is
only done by de-leading the zinc concentrates. Still.
93 p.c. is a great performance, and shows the long
strides that mill work has made in Broken Hill during
the past few years. The strides are really much longer
than a comparison of the figures would indicate,
because the officials’ calculations are made on a much
fairer basis than was mostly adopted until recent
days.

The capital of Hydro-Electric and Metals,
Ltd. —the Anglo-Tasmanian co. which is to utilise
the waters of the Great Lake—being assured, work
is to go ahead promptly. J. 11. Butters, for a
couple of years past engineer to Siemens Bros.’ Aus-
tralasian branch, has been appointed chief engineer
and manager of the electric works, and he is going to
Tasmania at once to lay out the work, prepare speci-
fications, etc. Butters has had a fine training, first
at London University College in Engineering, and
then at the famous Thornycroft works.
American zinc smelters are having a good
time, and new works are going up at a merry pace,
particularly in Oklahoma. That district is still
blessed with a supply of natural gas, whereas the
supply has run short in Kansas, resulting in a shut-
ting down of many furnaces there. Zinc ore (69
p.c.) fetches up to £8 per ton, and even the lower-
grade sulphide sells for a much better price than it
does in Australia. In the latter case, freight to the
other side of the globe is a handicap. The tem-
porary shortage of American furnaces and spelter is
proving a big help to those European metal firms
which are “supporting” the spelter market.
A co. is being formed to take over some
of the plantation property of Captain Svensen, m the

question at all about the fertility of the Solomons.

ihree or four years ago they took in hand a sub-
sidiary planting co., it was to the Solomons they
turned for their country. The co. now on the stocks
—Mamara Plantations, Ltd.- —will have the advantage
of starting with a large area already under culti-
vation, from which in seven years’ time a net profit
of £15,000 a year is expected; and by putting
£SOOO a year into development, the promoters reckon
in 10 years to be earning at least 25 p.c. net.
These figures cannot, of course, be checked; but,
given a supply of labor at the price figured on, there
seems to be no fly in the ointment. The labor supply
is the unknown quantity. There is certainly no
question of a White Solomons, and there isn’t likely
to be one for many years to come. For the property
the vendors get 40,000 paid £1 shares and £60,000
in cash; but £45,000 of the purchase money is not
payable until 1921, though meantime it carries 5 p.c.
The present issue consists of 40,000 shares to the
vendors and 40,000 to the public ; another 40,000 are
held in reserve. The shares are 10s. on application
and allotment; the other 10s. will be got in by calls
as the money is wanted for development. The first
£20,000, available on allotment, will pay the first
instalment of purchase money, and still leave a trifle
in hand. Half the shares are underwritten.

The success of the Victorian Araluen Cos.
(N.S.W.) has caused P. W. Tewksbury to open negoti-
ations with owners of other dredging areas at Ara-
luen. It is intended to form a co. with 32,000
shares, and place two large dredges on the ground.
Dredging promoters favor N.S.W., because the Vic-
torian regulations with regard to resoiling are irk-
some.
Great Cobar (N.S.W.) is aiming at a re-
cord output, and the men have been asked, as a
favor, to work four consecutive Sundays in order to
achieve it. It is said that the management wants
£50,000 to erect a concentrating and flotation
plant, and if Bellinger can get out a record tonnage
it will be some encouragement for the shareholders
to dip for the money. Funds haven’t been too plen-
tiful lately, wherefore no new works of any im-
portance are at present in hand; and, in general,
expenses are being cut down to the minimum. In
fact, rather below the safety level. Probably in a
couple of months time the excuse of a shortage of
labor will be heard again to account for a decreased
output. Murphv, the new Yankee smelter boss, has
shaken up the furnaces a bit, and a larger quantity
of Cobar Gold Mines and Chesney ore is going to
the smelters. This has made it still more evident
that underground work on the co.’s three main pro-
perties (Great Cobar, Chesney, and Cobar Gold
Mines) is very much behind. Fairly good ore has
been struck in the bottom level of the Chesney, but
not much can be pulled from there at present. The
sinking of the shaft is to be continued as soon as
possible, to see what’s below, and prospects are
good. But “as soon as possible” may not be very
soon. it has taken the co. the best part of a year
to sink the Cobar Gold Mines’ main shaft 100 ft.
(from 400 ft. to 500 ft.), and cut a plat, and there
it remains. Apparently, they don’t care about
driving the long distance into the lode. The sink-
ing was a blunder; anew shaft should have been
put down. On the Chesney a few men are em-
ployed cleaning-up and putting together the remains
of three Hancock jigs, and it looks as though a
little concentration is intended, probably to take
some of the slate out of the ore before it goes to the
smelters. But everything at present is being done
so slowly that a shortage of cash sticks out a yard.
■* * * *
Occidental gold mine, Gobar (N.S.W.),
is still battling along slowly with its bottom-levels
dirt. The co. has six concentrating tables at work.
The intention appears to be to put in tube-mills and
slime all the ore. The gold extraction is about 15
p.c. better from the slimes than from the sand, and
if that extra 15 p.c. can be saved by sliming the
ore, the tube-mills should soon pay for themselves.
But the drawback is the hard and tough nature of
the ore, which keeps the tonnage down. The co. is
at present sending an old heap of mixed slime and
sand to the treatment works, but that won’t last
many more weeks, and the output will then shrink.
Expenses, have been fairly heavy this last half-year.
A good deal of opening-out work has been done, and
anew change house and fitting shop have been
erected; but the number of hands has lately been
reduced, and a dividend may possibly come before
long. Yet it looks as though there won’t be many
of them, and, indeed, the policy most likely to
benefit the mine is to increase the reserve fund.
Crowl Greek (N.S.W.) is said to have
been purchased by plucky W. Longworth (former
part-owner of Great Cobar), and the old battlers
who have hung around that property since it closed
down some years ago feel better already. Anew
shaft will be required for a start; but a small
matter like that is not going to cause the Long-
worths many restless nights. Everyone wishes them
luck.
* * * *
Queen Bee (N.S.W.) is to have a half-
yearly meeting soon, and no doubt something will
be mentioned about smelting operations. The de-
velopments have been fairly good, though small,
and, as the available cash must be getting down a
little, it’s about time smelting was thought of. The
reports appearing in the press about rich strikes
and virgin ground, supplemented by glowing reports
from the mine manager, are beginning to look as
though a bait is being prepared to dangle in front
of shareholders and the public.
Cobar Gladstone (N.S.W.) report and
balance-sheet are out, and disclose rather better
prospects. It is the intention to sink the shaft
again, but that is a matter that will probably cause
someone a little worry, with the present appliances
on the mine.
Westralia’s gold dividends for July-
amounted to £77,019, making a total for the ex-
pired seven months of this year of £521,212. The
August distribution so far amounts to £78,297.

Great Boulder (W.A.) “finds it impossi-
ble to allow the Golden Horseshoe to use Edwards
shaft for the purpose of opening up the boundary
lode at 2800 ft.,” and, as a result, the market has
tumbled. If the Horseshoe can’t use that shaft it
will be two or three years before the co. can get at
the rich ore, which is supposed to exist at the depth
mentioned. In that case the chance of the Horse-
shoe officials redeeming their promises with regard
to profits in the near future is hopeless.
* ♦ * *
Some explanation of the recent mysteri-
ous rise in Hainaults (W.A.) is found in the follow-
ing excerpt from a letter which the manager wrote
to the London directors on June 5: “Generally the
mine is showing an improved appearance all round,
and already our exploration work is beginning to
show results which point to good bodies of ore
being developed on the eastern side of the lease.”
On this guarded opinion of the mine’s prospects,
shares rose a couple of shillings or more before buyers
began to consider the speculative aspect of the
question. # *
Somewhere about 1000 tons of Greenfinch
ore is being bagged for treatment at lvalgoorlie,
which means that the market is to be considered
first, and the mine either second or not at all. To
think about spending money on a battery when there
is so much development to be done is bad enough,
but to waste cash in cartage and railage charges is
a great deal worse. There is only one straightfor-
ward thing to do in the case of a show like this,
and that is to go on proving it until a sufficient ton-
nage is blocked out to justify a mill. This could
easily be done with the cash the co. has in hand, and
what it has within calling power; but as insiders
are credited with having most of the contributing:
scrip, and would consequently have to find a lot of
the extra money if calls were made, it may be that
they are responsible for egging the Board on to
adopt what is a most unwarrantable policy, and one
calculated to make the concern a mere gambling
counter.

From Meekatharra (W.A.) : The Mar-
mont, now owned exclusively by Tom Ryan, pro-
duced over £12,000 worth of gold last quarter. A
12 months’ option has been taken over the Ivyarra
on behalf of the Bullrush Cos. Hitherto the right to
work below water-level in this property has been re-
fused by the Government, because it is within the
boundaries of the local water reserve. An assurance
has, however, been given that if a mine is proved to
exist in depth the embargo will be removed. Mean-
time, a search is being made for water elsewhere.
Lupton’s lease at Barambie, which, up to date, has
starred a bit on surface crushings, has been floated
locally, with assistance obtained from the eastern
States. So far, about 700 tons have been treated for
a return of something over llOOoz. bullion. The
last parcel of 51 tons is said to have averaged 21oz. ;
but, maybe, this was what is generally known as a
flotation crushing. Barambie hasn’t been regarded as
the best place in the West to find permanent mines,
though everybody wishes Lupton’s show better luck.
Ingliston Consols pays a smaller dividend than usual
this month, while its near relative, the Ingliston
Extended, shows a larger profit. Latter has recently
substituted producer-gas for steam, and will be the
next Meekatharra mine to pay dividends. The Com-
modore ran across 9ft. of ore in the No. 3 level the
other day, 3ft. of which assayed 85s. per ton,
though these values have not been maintained in
driving. The development is interesting, as the
stone is in the present bottom workings, and ap-
parently east of what has hitherto been regarded as
the main body. Up to date the Fenian has paid its
four shareholders an aggregate of £102,000 in divi-
dends, and is now reputed to have 40,000 tons of
15dwt. ore in sight. The No. 6 level, is, however,
giving the management some concern.
* * * *
From the West: Emerald Option Cos. has
been filling up its Melbourne shareholders with glit-
tering accounts of its Westralian holding. Ore,, giv-
ing pan prospects up to 20z., is declared to be visible
for a good length at a few feet below water-level,
while (as usual) both faces are in rich stuff, and
underfoot the shoot looks better still. Something is
also said about it being difficult to understand how
a mine like the Emerald, which turned out such a
lot of gold in the ’9o’s, was never tested below
water-level. It was tested, and pretty extensively
too. Then it was abandoned. Maybe the present
crowd has got on to something new, but whether it
has struck the continuation of the old rich pipe, or
an isolated patch, has yet to
Golden Pole (W.A.) temporarily emerged
from obscurity the other day on reports of a good
development in the tributors’ workings. It has, how-
ever, since returned to the dusty corner whence it
came, which is a pretty good indication that the find
was nothing to blow about.
* * * *
One by one the Yilgarn (W.A.) “bon-
anzas” are being bowled out. The latest to be ex-
posed is the 4oz. ore which was alleged some months
ago to be visible on the Sunset lease, and on which
the show was floated. Even the State inspector of
mines indulged in the following whoop: “Just in-
spected Cortis’s new find (Sunset lease), Golden
Valley. Assays said to range from 3oz. to 84oz. ;
reckoned to average 4oz. per ton 10ft. across. No
walls yet. Consider the most promising find since
Bullfinch.” Alas! A trial parcel of 20 tons put
through a battery the other day gave lldwt., and as
the crushing had to be carted 30 miles, the co. was
probably out of pocket over the transaction. . The
co. reckons that the parcel treated was not a picked
one. If so, all that can be said is that the samples
from which the 4oz. assays were obtained must have
been very carefully picked. Unfortunately, that has
been one of the greatest curses of the Bullfinch
boom. Unwarranted estimates of the value of ore
were made all over the place, and later on the
public was hugely deceived. The “sampling has,
in fact, been ridiculous. #
For 12 months to March 31, Chillagoe
(Q.) smelted 61,094 tons of copper, silver, lead and
gold ore, which gave 3272 tons copper, 2376 tons
lead, 512,6250 z. silver and 11,6460 z. gold, repre-
senting a money value of between £5 and £6 per
ton. The co.’s gross receipts for the year amounted
to £623,606, or more than double the value of the
metals extracted at the smelting works. The dif-
ference represents the earnings of the long line of
railway from Mareeba to the Etheridge goldfield.
The negotiations with the Queensland Government
to take over the line are well advanced, and if the
deal comes off Chillagoe finances will be on a much

Mount Bischoff’s profit of £43,376 for the
six months is the best for years past, though the
output (550 tons of concentrates) was exactly tfie
same as for the previous term. A profit at the rate
of £7B per ton of concentrates is something to
boast of, though, of course, most of the honor and
glory belong really to the recent boom in the tin
market. The ore milled (101,310 tons) was slightly
less than for the previous half-year, but the extrac-
tion improved from 10.631 b. to 10.861 b. of oxide.
The profit of over Bs. per ton of crude stuff was very
high in proportion to value; but no aoubt this big
average from low-grade dirt was _ considerably helped
bv the profit made in the smelting department, it
is satisfactory to hear from the chairman that
Mount Bischoff can smelt as cheaply as the work can
be done in England. A recent slight slump m the
metal market will reduce prospective profits; still
things are running smoothly, and mechanical im-
provements will help the dividends.

The Oaks Rush (N.Q.) mill has obtained
a better water supply, and has started crushing.
The Acorn mine, next door, has cleaned Up at the
Welcome mill 299 tons for 107 oz. 13dwt. With
concentrates and sands it is estimated that the aver-
age will pan out lOdwt. The clean-up doesn t leave
much profit, so the market is slack. Oaks Rush is
also out of favor because the starting of the mill
was delayed so long, and because the Acorn return
isn’t up to the mark.
* * * *
During last quarter the Silverspur, Stan-
thorpe (Q.), had an output of 1749 tons, giving,
silver, 33,5440 z. ; gold, 5040 z. ; and copper, 19 tons.
The total value was about £4585. The owners have
been carrying on development work side by side with
the ore-gouging; and, as their main stopes have
reached the ore-body immediately under the 300 ft.
level west, better things are expected. The Warroo,
the only other decent return-giver in the district,
handled 464 tons for 5040 z. silver, 1660 z. gold and
12-i tons copper; total value, £I4OO. The bright
price of tin has set more scratchers on the trail,
which all helps the old tin town to get over its hor-
rible disappointment when it discovered that its
hopes of drawing millions from radium-manufacture
were built on a bubble.
Mungana (Q.) is preparing for a stoping
campaign now that the powerful new pump has
mastered the water. It is intended to attack the
lead sulphides in the Girofla mine, which is now pro-
vided with a mullock pass to facilitate the refilling
of the depleted ground at the 610 ft. level. Work is
also going on at the 300 ft. level in the Lady Jane.
Last year the Westralian Government
loaned £B3IO to lease and battery owners under the
Mining Development Act, but deductions, represent-
ing amounts charged to 1909, reduced the borrowed
total to £7900. Refunds aggregated £3201, so
that the actual out-of-pocket expenditure for the year
was £4699. Nearly £13,500 has been written off
as bad debts during the six years the Act has been
in force, but the bulk of this sum should have really
been shoved under the heading of “Waste.”
Some Southern (N.S.W.) colliery officials,
who have evidently already forgotten the Mount Ivem-
bla horror, got a very necessary though over-gentle
rap across the knuckles the other day. A deputy
or pannikin boss —had gone through the mine looking
for gas with a so-called safety lamp; but when the
lamp was looked at later on it was found to be
without the safety gauze. A rule requires officials
who learn of defaults of any kind to instantly report
them to the management; but three or four other
officials who knew of this shocking business turned
“oyster,” and the management only learnt of it
after some days had elapsed. It cost the principal
offender his job, and the others about £3 apiece.
* * * *
Callide coal country, at the back of Glad-
stone (Q.), is to be given another chance. One J.
H. Kessell has secured 2560 acres as a lease, and a
syndicate intends to “test the field, with a view to
future coal mining operations.” Mine Minister
Appel, in reply to Gladstone’s member the other
day, stated that £7950 had been spent by the Gov-
ernment in testing the central district, chiefly on the
Dawson River; but, as only £IOO had gone into the
Callide, that country would be given a chance “dur-
ing the current year.”

Altogether 616 mining accidents were re-
corded in Westralia during 1910, of which 29 proved
fatal. Explosions, falls of earth, and shaft and mis-
cellaneous underground casualties were responsible
for 404 serious and 23 fatal accidents, while surface
and machinery accounted for six fatalities and 183
cases of serious injury. Considerably more than one-
half of the accidents occurred at Kalgoorlie, where
11 mine workers met their death and 363 sustained
serious injury. Several hundred minor mishaps to
body and limb, including the usual percentage of
“narrow squeaks,” were also recorded; yet the idea
still prevails in some quarters that mining is not
the hazardous occupation it is cracked up to be.

“Quidam”: Re remarks of “Windlass”
(B. 3/8/’ll) anent the charges of Etheridge Rail-
way and Mines Cos. for crushing and cyanidmg. 15s.
a top for the former is certainly a good price, but
nothing out of the way for North Queensland. In
Central Queensland I never got a small lot crushed
for less than £1 per ton, and things are generally
cheaper there than in the North. As to the cyanid-
ing charges, if “Windlass” means that first one-
third of the tonnage is deducted from the sands,
and then one-third of the assay value of the sand
(together equalling two-thirds), and after that the
cost of treatment, it certainly is hot. If, however,
he means that one-third of the fire assay value of
the tailings is deducted, and payment made for
the two-thirds on the whole tonnage, less treatment
costs, it seems reasonable enough, as m North
Queensland ores there is generally a big difference be-
tween fire-assay values and cyanide returns. Ail or
more than one-third might easily be left m the tail-
ings. A lot of old miners think that cyanide ex-
tracts aU the gold in an ore, and all that most
cyaniders wish is that it would do so. Very many
heaps of residues, even of fairly clean stuff, have
more left in than the cyanide gets out. ■ When the
process that can extract practically all the gold in
tailings arrives, a lot of cyaniders are going to
quit cyaniding very suddenly.

From Maoriland: Talisman, Karanga-
hake, got £18,740 from 4500 tons for its last four
weeks. The co. pays its 27th div., a useful eighteen-
pence. Prospects are quite as good as hitherto. Ihe
div. returns a shade under an annual 12 p.c. on
market value ; and there is also an occasional bonus. A
new reef carrying rich stone has been opened up near
Reefton (South Island), and the ground all round
has been pegged out. Consolidated Goldfields (Reef
ton) continue steady returns— Progress, 4028 tons
for £4324 (cyaniding and sulphurets £1986) ,
Wealth of Nations, 2169 tons for £3883 (cyanidmg
and sulphurets £1370) ; Blackwater 4210 tons for
£7672 (cyaniding and sulphurets £1455). lairua
Mines, over the hills from Thames, makes a nice
start with £433 from 350 tons from plates only,
cyaniding of residuals to come. Thames Deep
Levels’ crosscut has got through its hard bar and is
again in good sandstone country. An inflow ot
water has set the pumps a quicker pace, and may mean
either another reef handy or the draining of old work-
ings 400 ft. overhead. May Queen is getting some
picked stone from the reef first cut by this crosscut,
and Saxon is getting nice dabs of gold m the reef
in its ground. The Waihi-Paeroa Gold Extraction
Cos., which is getting on well with its £ 70,000-plant
for dredging and treating the tailings that lie m the
Ohinemuri River, expects to be banking returns early
next vear. Near Waihi the co. treated some 38,000
tons for an encouraging £14,000, but was washed
out by the big flood. It was then decided to launch
out in the present big plant at Paeroa, and so catch
not only the Waihi but the Itarangahake tailings.
The co. expects to start on 500 tons a day, increasing
to 750 tons. #
Every engineer in charge of factories and mills
should give close attention to the power wasted in
transmission of power. The Hyatt Flexible Roller
Bearings save 20 per cent, power and 75 per cent
of oil, so one of the first duties is naturally for
engineers to direct their special attention to these
bearings and to car boxes for trucks. Hyatts are
in continuous use in Cement Works, Ore Dressing
Mills, Factories, etc., in Australia. Bushings 01
flexible rollers may be applied to loose pulleys or
truck wheels, etc. Should engineers require further
details, they can applv to the Australian Agents,

The undisputed benefit of asbestos covering for

The Bigelow Patent Rock Breaker commends
itself to mine managers who welcome an effective
machine which is cheaper to maintain and repair
than Gyratory and other crushers. This machine is
of the well-known Blake type, but has some ad-
ditional improvements which have justified in prac-
tice all the claims advanced by the patentee. The
work of crushing is done on the down-stroke of the
pitman instead of the up-stroke; there is no strain
on the pitman cap; two large side rods resist the
thrust of the toggles, and enable the jaws to be
regulated within a large range; the back toggle is
so made as to resist all legitimate strains of crush-
ing, but will shear under exceptional conditions and
save the machine. The shaft and eccentric bearings
are self-lubricating; the jaws are convex and con-
cave, and with the cheek plates are made of steel
and are reversible. The Austral Otis Engineering
Company, of South Melbourne, have installed a great
number of these machines, and hold the sole manu-
facturing rights for the Commonwealth.* [3

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, August 21, 1011.
-My Dear Arini, —
The passing of Cardinal Moran has
thrown a blaze of light on the departed
f hurchman and scholar, and made most
brands of religion shake hands beside the
Mighty Dead. With tolling bell and raven
drapery, chanted prayers and lighted tapers,
St. Mary’s did homage to its great chief,
lor days the tram-service nosed its way with
ant-like patience through the crowds that
hung round the Cathedral which enshrined
the emblamed remains of the late Cardinal.
There was a light-hearted bubble in his
bookish temperament which made this
learned prelate’s rare appearances at Society
Parades a joyful item to those who circled
round his stately robes. At one of the last
ot these gatherings—the Government House
private view” of Longstaff’s portrait of
J.ady Dudley —the Cardinal, in sitting down,
somehow missed the chair and went to the
floor. With an almost boyish gaiety that
astounded elderly male persons in the early
twenties, the Cardinal was on his feet in a
moment, before the adjacent group had time
to stretch out a helping hand. Death seemed
tar away then from this indomitable spirit.
Archbishop Kelly, who succeeds the dead
Cardinal, is himself, hurrying towards the
JMiadow; he knows it, and is unafraid. A
man to whom a mistake in this matter
should be almost impossible, assures me
that some months ago one of Sydney’s great
surgeons broke the news to him. “My
dear Doctor,” said the Archbishop cheer-
tu‘ly> please do not worry, for I
assure you I don’t. I am like a traveller
with his bags packed waiting for the jour-
ney to begin.” It is a big asset, the faith
which can make a man regard the horrors
ot inoperable cancer in that spirit.
Melba stepped out of the Victorian ex-
press, looking 30 or thereabouts, in a plum-
colored tailor-made, dark furs, and a high
plumed hat. A night of train jolting and
the cold light of a drab morning couldn’t
bowl out our skylark on the dull wicket of
mere years. Her physical health must be
superb; she walks with the spring of twenty,
and the poise of an Indian water-carrier.
John Lemmone’s smile was first out of the
car Melba came next, and was rushed at
with flowers. Henry Bracy (also growing
younger) gave a morsel of blue frock and
naxen hair the right impetus, and she
dropped a huge basket of blooms at Nellie's
toes. When little Valerie Mason—the
youngest atom of the new Opera Co.—backed
away from the Presence, H. N. Southwell
very spruce in new millinery, did light por-
terage for floral tributes, and went off with
the air of a prima donna in luck. Con-
ductor Joseuh Bradley hurried into the
melee and Claude Mackay, of the J.C.W
staff, also spent the prayerful end of the
Sabbath at the Central Station.
The notion that Coombe Cottage, in Vic-
toria, is intended as an Australian
home for the masterful songstress—a
rural Australian resting-place for her
tired ambition seems to be wide of
the truth. It will be the store-house
ot ner art-treasures—the interesting col-
lection of things she intends for family
heirlooms and sundry bequests. These were
all in her London house at Great Cumberland
1 lace, which she sold a while ago to Lady
Randolph Churchill for many thousands of
pounds ihe treasures had to be stored
somewhere; and, as they were destined for
Australia, the charming cottage at Lilydale
will serye as their museum.
Tenor John McCormack’s wife, her sister
(Miss holey), and two chubby children
with engaging dimples, have arrived. John
follows, and will step ashore next Monday.
Mrs. John is a bright, black-haired Irish
woman, with sparkling eyes and domestic
habits. The McCormack babies vigorously
attacked Coogee’s sandheaps with spades
and other implements the day after their
arrival.
the tube skirt. There’s comfort in the
Melba tailor-made, which showed a wider
area of stuff about the knees, when the wearer
nim bly off the Melbourne express.
As Melba makes two pilgrimages a year to
1 ans for her plumage, with incidental treks
to other shrines, her garments must be the
last word m Fashion. The female stick is
apparently getting out of date, and the pre-
sent Chinese trot of the Tube Lady will
soon become a memory.
A returned Coronatrix pours in the item
that George and Mary’s only girl is an
elder sister in the hardworked intervals of
being a Princess on show. “When the Royal
carriage-load of children passed our stand on
" un e s h e says, “little George, in a glee-
ful frenzy, was stampeding about it as if
the horses and crowds had gone to his head
bister Mary gave him a gentle smack, shook
him in the manner that prevails during
kmckerbocker riots in humble homes, and
sat him firmly in one corner of the carriage.
]n tl L e nursery argument, Mary’s coronet
tell off and was picked up by the Prince of
\V ales, who hurriedly popped it on again.
In an instant tne girl became the Person-
age, and bowed affably to the crowd, the
eclipse of George, junior, being so rapid
that very few saw it.”
The Westralian Jioys, now climbing green
seas in search of Vancouver, passed through
Sydney last week. J. ,T. Simons isn’t quite
tall enough to stand still as a lighthouse, so
he moves across the ocean to pilot this pil-
grimage, which will sample American foot-
ball and British beef before it is finished.
The boys are Australian from cover to cover,
and their national sentiment boiled over in
The Bulletin office the other day, when
light refreshments and brief speeches were
poured out. Mr. Simons answered back,
from his altitude amongst the office beams,
that the Union Jack was all right—they
wore it with a home-grown trimming of
Southern Cross. The biggest youth amongst
YV estralia’s 47 boys is large enough to take
on any stranger who throws dead-cats at
this continent, and the smallest dresses in a
ferocious trumpet, a green tassel, a gilt map
of Australia, and other drapery of local
manufacture.
The Patriotic Club, Ltd., opened its resi-
dential apartments for women with an offi-
cial broadside of cream puffs and other
weapons last week. Miss Margaret Harris
has hurled waggon-loads of good-looking fur-
niture into the abode. Mrs. Cecil Youl, who
concealed a residential club for women in
her secret thoughts for quite two years,
showed a meek front to a roomful of polite
remarks. Blessings, unappropriated or other-
wise, with nice luggage and personal refer-
ences, can now put up at this Patriotic dove-
cot for any period from one night to a
month without unpacking their politics.
Once a year the N.S.W. Kindergarten Union
rubs noses in _a fraternal council meeting,
and gathers its accounts together over
a teapot, at its headquarters in Roslyn
Cardens. Acting-Gov. Cullen’s gentle dame
presided at last week’s meditations. Dr
Philip Sydney Jones inserted a slab of criti-
cism into the shortage of trained Kinder-
garteners. A higher standard of theoreti-
cal training tears the student from her prac-
tical work, and the wave of prosperity which
tosses a golden spray over the State has
caused a shrinkage of applicants for the
Kindergarten course. Mrs. Francis Anderson
and principal Elizabeth Jenkins weighed out
the good results of Free Kindergarten
schools; general sec. Ellen Desailly—-as re-
cording angel, in a pepper and salt tailor-
made and alluring millinery—stabbed a
tountain-pen into reports and other heavy-
weight matter. Mr. Boorman, who never
lias time, to get into mischief, because he
spends his otherwise-spare moments toiling
for the Golden Fleece Kindergarten, hurled
t i n,r rief remarks at the gathering. Mr.
John Mackay, another honorary worker and
Mrs. Goldschmidt were on the official trail.
The meeting- was packed to the doorkey
which resisted the attempts of late-comers to
squeeze in.
The Professional Women Workers’ Asso-
ciation has caught the enlargement microbe
and reconstructed itself on a bigger scale,
it slams the door, as of old, in the face of
dabblers, and only admits the paid worker
t 9 its camp. Dr. Grace Boelke, Miss Har-
liott, 8.A., and Mrs. C. Day are in charge
or its morals, which are militant in the cause
of women and children.
A B.A. of Sydney Uni. recently believed
herself predestined to inject verbs, Latin
roots, and other necessary evils into upcoun-
try youngsters. She got away to the Never-

Mummer Langford Kirby’s cousin, Captain

advertmed ornament of the new Gov.-Gen.’s

past There is nothing of the Bayard
about Healy when he is on the political war-
path. He fights “all in.” Hazleton’s re-
cord, moral, financial and otherwise, was so
stainless that the worst thing the infuriated
limothy could tell the electors about his op-
ponent was that he had been to Buenos
Aires to bone an heiress”—a rotten pun
that was universally conceded to be un-
worthy of Healy’s genius.
Papua loses its head-nurse next month—
not Lieut.-Gov. Murray, who has chief
charge of the infant but Nurse Gertrude
Tait, of larkes (N.S.W.), who was chosen
last year to go up and pat the pillows in
the big Possession’s bush hospitals. There
isn t another Australian woman who
knows so much about the Tropical
as this Nightingale does. For
five years she was nurse and matron
at the Thursday Island Hospital, and
not many people have the chance that
a hospital nurse at Thursday Island has to
get a real knowledge of the Jap and the
fuzzy-headed tribes of Ham and Japlieth. She
had scarcely shaken down into her new
Papuan charge when the Lakekamu gold-
rush happened, followed by the worst out-
break of disease that Papuan gold-rushes
have known. So Papua’s chief nurse was
packed off up among the swamps, on the
edge of German New Guinea, and there she
has been battling with fevers and other
troubles for five months, the one white
woman on the field. She rarely goes visit-
ing ; her nearest white-woman neighbor she
could reach by going down the river, through
interminable sago-palm swamps, a three-
days’ journey; and that would be merely
the start of the expedition along the coast.
She handles a good pen, and if she doesn’t
use it when she gets back to sidewalks and
afternoon-teas, it will be a shocking waste
of wonderfully-rare material.
Attorney-General Findlay (M.L.), who
returns with baronet Joe Ward, brings with
him, as excess luggage, one of the gauds
that somehow' missed. Adelaide’s Mayor
Cohen. Findlay bears a general facial like-
ness to Gov. Islington, whose arduous efforts
to label his missus “Her Excellency” may
yet cause a riot in M.L. I was sniffing sul-
phur in Rotorua when Gov. Plunket got
ashore, and began to struggle for the same
tag for his wife —a piece of court-plaster to
which only the Australian G.-G.’s dame, the
Indian Viceroy’s missus, and the Canadian
G.-G.’s best girl have any shred of right.
The official Blue Book is reported to go
black in the face over the fight of the
smaller Gov. House fry to crown its lady
“Her Ex.”

kicked off by F. W. Jackson, as Sydney
manager of the Union Steamship Co.’s busi-
ness. David, who has an old reputation for
affable habits, is the brother of knight
James. Mr. Jackson’s footwear will hence-
forth be the comfortable slippers of the re-
tired veteran.
High Church parson Albery, who for-
merly rounded up souls with much zeal in
Christ Church paddocks, and whose marriage
was a nine-days’ wonder to his flock, mi-
grated with his Australian wife to the Chan-
nel Isles. Jersey is now their home, and a
new daughter their most exciting possession.
Colonel R. Wallace, R.A.G.A., and Chief
of the Scrap-Iron locker, recently put into
this port from Melbourne, to sit on our Har-
bor searchlights. The mercantile marine is
much worried in its eyesight when a long
oin of white light reaches out from South
Head, and hits its steering gear on a black
night. General Gordon, with Sapper Wil-
kinson (who trains mines at Chowder), com-
pletes the khaki commission of Wise Men.
.Mrs. Wallace passed back to Melbourne the
other day, after a hurried look-in at Syd-
ney’s blue-water front.
Laurence Godfrey Smith—commercially
and otherwise one of this town’s most suc-
cessful pianists—is packing up his kit-bag
tor Europe. Vienna will be his chief resting
place.
Fiddler Lorna Ussher, just back from
Leipsic, where she used her bow under the
eye of Prof. Hans Becker, chats cheerily
°f, hfe en pension. Lorna avoided flats
where the bachelor girl generally neglects
her food, and buys chocolates instead of
beef. “A small room in a good—that is to
say, well-kept—pension is much better than
a more ' pretentious room in a cheaper
house.” Lorna is sure that girl-students in
foreign flats develop ribs and sharp corners
instead of flesh and grey matter, the cup of
tea being a handy method of genteel starva-
tion. “Mere food is a necessity,” muses the
girl with the fiddle.
Eileen O’More (Bessie Doyle) is said to
be now officially connected with the Leland-
Stanford Uni. (U.S.). where she teaches
the Young Idea to fiddle.
Representatives of two very old Australian
families had a wedding recently at St.
Augustine’s, Neutral Bay. The bride was
the fourth daughter of the late Marcus Dul-
hunty, of Mosman, and the groom William
Marsden, eldest son of the late H. S. M.
Betts, of Yale Head, Molong. The groom
is descended from Parson Marsden, of the
very early days; the Vale Head farm was
one of the vigorous old parson’s grants. The
bride is a grand-daughter of Colonel Gibbes,
a former Collector of Customs, the grand-
father on her father’s side being a Dr. Dul-
hunty, who gave up medicine for sheep. The
founder of the Betts family in Australia was
John Betts, of Parramatta, who married a
daughter of the Rev. Samuel Marsden.
The Stewdrt-Newmarch wedding in St
James’s Church attracted battalions of doc-
tors to the orange-blossoming of Dr. New-
march’s only girl. Dr. Colin Stewart Was
the man, and Miss Remington, Miss Bray
and a little Miss M. Gilfillan were assistant
high-priestesses. Later on, when the guests
fluttered their wedding finery across King-
street and scurried up the steps of St. James’s
Hall, the sprint of this city’s best-known
doctors for the wedding feast suggested the
outbreak of a sudden epidemic— probably
champagne and confetti.
Mr. Geddis, who owns a newspaper
or two in Maoriland, with artist W.
Blomfield—whose signature “Bio’ ” is often
in Maoriland’s eye—has just passed through
Sydney after a scamper across Europe. Rlr.
Geddis hasn’t seen any place he likes better
than Geyserland, or any girl he admires as
much as his own Best Girl. Mrs. Geddis
met him on the Australian shore, and they
got away for the North Island this week.
Asked if he saw the Coronation, Mr.
Geddis admitted that he glued both eyes on
to the procession, and also noted that the
masses were in no humor to explode with
joy at the feet of the peerage. “George is
popular, but this labor trouble was brewing
in June, and the note of sullen apathy in
the crowds was so ominous that we hurried
away from England—there was no telling
how the strike would extend, and we didn’t
want to get stuck on the other side ”
A note frsm a confirmed traveller:—
Struck a troupe of entertainers on the Sydney ex-
press the other night, but hadn’t the heart to strike
em hard. Should like to introduce the “turn” to
the Railway Commissioners. Though the “troupe”
consisted of two only, the “duo” managed to get in
some very effective work. As a matter of fact, thev
woke me up from a sound sleep at about 2 a.m. E
lay and listened awhile to the tuneful strains of a
mouth-organ accompaniment to a male soprano’s
singing of “Break the News to Mother” ; then, curi-
osity prompting me, I jumped out of my bunk and
proceeded to investigate the weird phenomenon.
Making my way to the rear of the car, I came upon
the minstrels. They proved to be two conductors of
the train, and seemed quite surprised when I in-
quired what the row was about! They explained
that, by a recent rule of the Department, they wen-
forbidden now-a-nights to so much as nod on the
trip, so they. had to keep awake somehow! 1
quite saw their point, but by this time the entire
sleeping-car was awake and hurling curses at my
head for “talking at that time o’ night,” so, feeling
a bit foolish, I crawled back to bed.
A stray dogs’ carnival is going to happen
at the North Sydney Coliseum skating rink
on August 31. The Admiralty lady will
hand over the prizes to those who struggle
best in a tug-oGwar, elopement race, and
other classic devices for snaring funds for
the Neutral Bay Dogs’ Home. Dames
errant, on skates, are going to make a blind-
fold dash for the blackboard picture of a
tailless dog. They will (d.v.) append a
chalk fixture to the spot nearest to the
beast’s appendix. She who tilts at the tail
with happiest results will receive her reward
on earth five minutes later. Miss Gullett,
who presides over the Dogs’ Home cogita-
tions; hon. sec., Miss Compton Legge ; and
Mrs. Fritz Hart, an incurable optimist, are
scraping in stony ground for subscriptions
of any - size.
Maorilanders in this city are going to
give a Dominion Day hop on September 2U
at Sargent’s.
The Blascheck-Wrighton combination still
incites even the timid to explore the city
for the marble steps that lead up to the
Y.M.C.A. Hall and Mildred’s explanatory
music. Mr. Joe Blascheck cheerfully emerges
from a “Spring Cleaning” and other domes-
tic arguments, while Miss Wrighton eggs
him on with harmonic chords at the piano,
It’s the best one-man-one-girl show we’ve
had for years, and the girl’s good looks
supply a long-felt want in Y.M.C.A. circles.
Swords have recently clanked through this
town in a great military exodus due north.
The returning Defence-Minister Pearce has
been the objective; the tourists will pick
him up at Brisbane or further north. Mean-
time Paymaster Laing and the office cat are
alleged to be the sole defenders of the
Ancient Armory department’s headquarters.
As this closes, the Health Society’s
ladies are assimilating pearls of wis-
dom in the Town Hall, on the subject
of slums and similar crimes against
a clean city. Dr. W. G. Armstrong is the
lecturer, and he tramples on “Insanitary
Dwellings” with both feet.
At the same moment., in another selection
of the Town Hall, various citizens are con-
spiring together to give Carrie Lanceley’s
coming concert in aid of five local hospitals
a push forward. Carrie can’t keep away
from harmonious noises for more than five
minutes, and she collected all available musi-
cal talent in her home-nest on two evenings
last week. Surrounded by palms, wild
flowers, and other stimulants to sing, th<'
company did its best. Then the Gore Hill
girl, heavily laden with her presentation
tourmalines —large chunks of green sparkle,
edged with milk-white Australian pearls—
joyfully sang the “Jewel Song.”
The suicide of American novelist Myrtle
Reed recalls the cynical remark of a well-
known pen-woman—l fancy it was John
Oliver Hobbes—that hairpins, husbands and
babies were generally mixed up with the
literary woman’s writing materials. Myrtle
Reed dragged her husband’s name into the
tragedy of her death, perhaps unjustly.
Who knows? “If he had been kind and
considerate,” sounds like an ordinary fit of
married blues when the male creature wipes
his muddy boots on the new stair-carpet.
Yours, with a broad nib.
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, August 21, 1911.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The Denmans are keeping up a running
fire of small dinners to which the Very Best
People are bidden in turn. The social sheep
that baa away out on the edge of the flock
will doubtless get their share of drink and
entertainment in the race-time garden
parties.
Lord Dick Nevill, who returns to Aus-
tralia to act as G.-G. Denman’s chamberlain
in the absence of sick-man Victor Hood, will
be here in good time to devotedly shadow
Melba.
The Fuller pair continue their scheme for
the division of their toil. Accordingly Lady
Fuller went to Buffalo with Miss Phipps
and a party, while his Ex. attended a few
country shows. The country show’, which
is painfully plentiful at this time of year,
is a great test of vice-regal endurance; yet
Carmichael got so much practice that before
he left Australia he could “do” them as easily
as an art show. Lady Fuller enjoyed the
rugged rocks and the snows, and was able
to enjoy some ski-ing. Bright, the stopping
place on the descent, organised a carnival
for her, and then returned her safely to
town.
The Barttelot pair have taken Dr. Norris’s
South Yarra house for a term. Married
gentlemen-helps have been to Australia be-
fore this, and have been provided with quar-
ters under the official roof. They were all,
however, “without encumbrance.” Sir
Walter and his lady, on the other hand, own
two fine boys, and feel that they need a
place of their own. The youngsters trav-
elled out with the two Denman babies on the
Themistocles, which arrived last week.
Ethel Irving, in “Lady Frederick,” is fin-
ishing the present Melbourne season with
crammed houses. Before Wednesday’s mat-
inde there was quite a stampede for seats;
afterwards there was a suppressed riot of
disappointment because “Dolly’s Little
Bills” had to be cut out of the programme.
Dolly, who “never had the money sense,”
and rouses the wrath of her bridegroom with
her chiffon accounts, fascinates the feminine
mind, and provides thrills of sympathetic
horror. Most women have passed through
the financial ordeal at one time or another
with papa or hubby. Leading-man Ewart,
with his locks becomingly silvered, bears a
strong resemblance to Sam McCullagh, the
handsome widower of Woodlands.
Ethel Irving recently turned her trans-
lucent orbs to the gallery girl, and gave her
a general invitation to come along and meet
her at Menzies’ Hotel. It was a senti-
mental, heart-to-heart roast, with straw-
berry and coffee for stuffing. A corner was
occupied by a piano, and one of the girls
produced a sister who could sing. The host-
ess volunteered to play the accompaniment,
and the vocalist did so nicely that she is to
have a chorus place in the next show.
The gallery lady is making a pose of her
adoration of Ethel. Nowadays she takes a
folding sketching-stool, some fancy work and
her lunch, and squanders the day in the
queue, buoyed up with the hope that a
deeply-touched leading lady will discover her
and _ send her out tea and buns. This
species of mild lunatic became common dur-
ing the stay of tne Asches. Scientists and
other dustmen have found them abroad as
early as eght in the morning.
Ambrose Patterson has painted a portrait
of “dad” for Melba, and it is just about
ready for her inspection. The artist is a
protege of the singer’s; she gave him
two years in Paris, and looked him up when-
ever she was passing that way. The
painter’s brother, Tom, is one of Melba’s
brothers-in-marriage-law, and Mrs. Tom
goes to Sydney for the opening of the opera
season as her sister’s special guest. “You
look peaked,” remarked Melba to the rather
pale-faced matron, and straightway arranged
to take her away north, where sunshine
is supposed to be more plentiful.
The star had a whirling time motoring
about Victoria the week after her arrival.
She was to have crossed the Murray within
three days ; but, instead, she sent an avail-
able brother-in-law to attend to pressing busi-
ness, and thereby gained several extra days
wherein to oversee the finishing of Coombe
Cottage. A family party motored there on
Friday last and had a scratch meal. The
ukase is that no other guests are to see it
until everything is complete.
There is to be a marriage in the Melba-
Mitchell family very soon. The eldest of
David Mitchell’s sons and the diva’s brothers
has won a fluttering “Yes” from the bright
little widow who nursed Dad at Doonside.
Premier Murray’s daughter, who accom-
panied her father to the hungry city by the
Thames, was to have been presented at the
Coronation Drawing-room; but, when the
other women were doing their agonised best
not to fall over their trains, the Australian
girl was being waited on by nurses in a pri-
vate hospital. When the mail left the disap-
pointed one was making a slow recovery.
The Australian relatives of the Countess
of Darnley are glowing over her d6but as a
song-music writer. She has got the inmates
of most London drawing-rooms by the ear
with a ditty called “Content,” for the words
of which May Aldington is responsible. The
brunette countess, as some people have for-
gotten, was Miss Morphy, a Victorian girl.
Mrs. Daniels is a sister, and the Titian-
haired lady who married P. and O. Roberts
is a niece. Artist Fox painted this pretty
girl when she was Beatrice Daniels.
The Glassy Harem’s slight social frost is
being rapidly thawed by the sunny influ-
ence of vice-regal interest. Under the Den-
man party’s skates the ice almost melts
with gratitude, for the returned Coronators,
seeing the G.-G. group on the floor, have
made a rush for their sliding implements.
The management rubs its hands and
chuckles. A grand fancy-dress carnival is
to happen this (Thursday) evening.
The golf tournament now smiting its way
round the links is minus one devoted player.
Whilst motoring last week, Dr. Jack Gordon
bumped into a train, at a dangerous Bruns-
wick crossing, and he, the shover, and the
car, got the worst of the argument. The
shover was the sorest sufferer, losing a hand
and acquiring skull fracture. The doctor
escaped injury, but received a severe shock.
A curious effect was that he lost the sight
of one eye for several hours after the smash.
Mrs. Gordon, who is also a golf enthusiast,
deserted the tournament in order to watch
over her invalid medicine-man.
The other day Acting-Premier Watt mo-
tored to Kyneton, the district in which he
was born, and the countryside tendered him
a picnic welcome. Willie talked in a remin-
iscent strain to the children in the school
where he acquired knowledge, and then de-
clared 'a holiday. A flag was stuck in the
ground where the house that once sheltered
the man of the hour used to stand, and alto-
gether Kyneton had a Great Day—compara-
tively speaking.
Madge Fink, daughter of Theodore, is to
be married very soon to V/'alter Timmins.
The two go to America for their honeymoon,
and, later on, are to settL in Melbourne in
a new house they are bui.ding on a part of
the cut-up Chatswood es'.ate. A wilderness
garden amongst the ti-t/ee is to be one of
the features of the hr me. Miss Fink, by
way of following in father’s educational
footsteps, _ has been .studying housekeeping
and cooking on the most modern plans.
For a girl who is well off, she has remark-
ably few delusions about servants. The kit-
chen is to be electrified, and made as far as
possible independent of the coy and uncertain
Marianne, so that the bride may cook at her
ease. Bridegroom-elect Wally Timmins is
one of several well-known brothers.
Assistant-Paymaster Ramsay, of the Com-
monwealth Naval Forces, and Miss Gertrude
Leslie, daughter of the T. G. Leslies, have
intimated to their friends that they intend
to incur the usual waste of rice and confetti
at some future date.
In satin, lace, orchids and pearls, Hilda
Grantham ceded the centre bit of her pater-
nal name, and became Mrs. Captain Ber-
tram R. Graham, at St. John’s, Toorak, on
August 10. Hubby comes from some ’pore
or other in India, where he captains the
Queen’s Own Corps of Guides. He will take
his bride to India, home and duty after a
honeymooning in the Blue Mountains. The
best man was a brother officer, Captain I. E.
Blois Johnson, and the groomsman was Tom
Grantham. DorothvM’Caughey, of the Wood-
lands clan, and Wanda Pinnock were the
two pale-pink bridesmaids. Mrs. Grantham
got away from the speeches and flurry at
her mother’s place in a navy-blue travelling
serge amid a sprinkling of rose leaves.
Art students hereabout darkly suspect
a serious and silent canvas-critic of matri-
mony. The suspect has hitherto ranked as
a woman hater, and has diplomatically kept
female worshippers at a respectful distance.
Wedding bells are shortly to ring for tennis
chamoion A. F. Wilding, of Christchurch
(M.L.), and .Miss Joel, daughter of the
S’African millionaire, who is reputed to be
richer even than the Duke of Westminster!
Whatever happens, the Wildings should al-
ways be able to stand the racket financially.
The ill-fated expedition of French avia-
tors to Melbourne last year is leading to
some result, anyhow. One of the French
gentleman, with a strikingly romantic name,
is now under matrimonial contract to a local
girl.
Leonard Borwick and the Marshall-Hall
Orchestra gave joint and several aid to Mel-
bourne’s musical culture, at the Town Hall,
last Saturday afternoon. The hit of the
concert was Beethoven’s Emperor Concerto,
with which Carreno was introduced to
Melbourne some years ago. With gentle
Leonard at the piano, the effect of the Em-
peror was less imperial, but decidedly more
harmonious, than when Carreno bossed the
show. Madame made the forces at the back
of her sound comparatively ragged and un-
certain; but the “poet of the piano,” as the
Taits call him, shed a softening, sympathetic
influence, and the slow “madonna” move-
ment of the second part was charmingly
done. The usual Marshall-Hall incident
gave a touch of humor to the concerto. A
lady in the left-hand balcony had left her
seat to close a draughty door, and, with
glaring eye and upraised baton, the great
mokanna of music waited for her to creep
back into her place ere his soul would allow
him to start. The offender crept back; but
in her agitation at being singled out by the
terrible Eye, she dropped her ’brella, and the
waiting audience whispered “Serve him
right!” Had the poor woman dropped a
brick she might have earned loud applause.
A recital of songs written by May Brahe
is to happen at Allan’s this (Thursday)
afternoon. The piano starts at 8.30. and
half a dozen artists—Maggie Stirling, Lilian
Reid, Rebottaro, etc. —have undertaken to
give the Brahe songs a good sounding.
The allegedly-old Xaverians hung scarlet
geraniums on the chandelier of the St. Kilda
Town Hall last Tuesday, and danced joy-
ously in the lurid light of scarlet-shaded
electrics. The dancing Old Boys were mostly
very young indeed; but a few mature old-
sters benevolently watched the whirl in com-
pany with some visiting old collegians. Dr.
Edward Ryan, president of the association,
extended a welcome to representatives from
“Geelong” and “Scotch,” and told a St.
Peter’s (Adelaide) man that they were all
glad to see him. After the first lancers,
these grave and reverend ones left the danc-
ing to the frivolous, and retired to talk poli-
tics—or something. The musicians tried the
new “slow” waltz on the nimble-footed sec-
tion, but it didn’t take. It is a dreamy, lan-
guorous glide, which merely irritates ener-
getic dancers who are out for a healthy
frolic.
The elusive Angel of Success flapped her
gold-tipped wings over a juvenile fancy ball
held in the Prahran Town Hall on a recent
night, for a children’s ward at the Talbot
epileptic colony. Over 1000 kiddies of all
ages and sizes took the floor, and their dress-
ing was astonishingly good. Dames a’Beckett
Best, Donald Mackinnon and Guy Sherwood
were the judges, and awarded the first prize
after deep consideration, to a set of miniature
black and yellow jesters. A march past, ar-
ranged by Miss Hyams, was a bewilderingly
pretty sight. When the joyous pageant of
youth had passed, the judges looked like
people who had been presented with a prob-
lem tougher than the most expensive motor-
tyre. However, they solved it satisfactorily.
At wrapping-up time, the word flew round
that all hands had assisted at a financial suc-
cess.
On Friday last the Writers’ Club, Spring-
blossomed for the occasion, supplied Ethel
Irving with one scone (earned by affabilitv)
and one cup of tea (bonus). The guest
was a gracious vision, in hat, coat and shoes
of thrush-egg blue —a summer-sky impres-
sion translated into exquisite clothes. Miss
Nelson, of the co., accompanied her in an
18-carat frock, and a hat decked with bird
of paradise tails. I think there must be a
surplusage of those birds on the other side of
the Styx; otherwise I can’t imagine how the
white-winged rangers could allow them to be
captured in such quantities by the milliners.
The Bunnys are settling down for a long-
browse on Australian pastures, encouraged
thereto by the sale of several of the high-
priced exhibition pictures for the adornment
of Toorakian private galleries. Moreover,
portrait-painting commissions are flowing in ;
so Rupert and his charming French wife
have taken the widow Watson’s house in
South Yarra. Mrs. Sib Currie and her
small daughter are the artist’s present
“sitters.”
The only horses in the carriage paddock
on a crowded day of the recent Caulfield
meeting were two belonging to the Tom
Paynes. Poor neddy! So far as the race-
course is concerned, he is now merely a
racing machine.
From “Rosna,” in London-
The motor smash, in which George Reid and his
daughter were the chief sufferers, caused much ex-
citement in Empiah circles, and telegrams of con-
cern rushed in from George Rex and a quantity of
the Beerage. Daily bulletins were posted outside
the Bank of Adelaide, in Leadenhall-street, telling
the world how much sleep and nourishment the in-
valids were taking. The Reid damsel, by the way,
has nerve—a fact that was illustrated at the Pageant
of Empire. She was impersonating the Queen of
Australia in the Masque Imperial, when the steeds
belonging to her chariot became facetious, and
began waving their feet about the atmosphere. The
gallant outriders —not Australians, I beg to state —-
jumped down and fled, leaving the damsel in sole
charge of the acrobatic beasts. She was equal to
the occasion, however, and extricated herself from
the chariot in a cool and blithesome manner.
Sydney and Melbourne each had a Wattle
Day last year; but rain was pouring on Mel-
bourne when the appointed time arrived, and
the celebration was swamped. The Gaud
Mayor, who was in charge, said “Better luck
next time,” or words to that effect, and in-
timated that another attempt would be made
in 1911. September 1 is the day chosen by
the Wattle Day League for the glorification
of the gold blossom. G.-G. Denman is patron
and Sub.-Ex. Fuller vice-patron of the floral
band, of which ordinary mortals may become
life members at a guinea a time. The unco’
canny, who are afraid their lives may not
stretch to 21 years, may be Leaguers for a
lone shilling every twelvemonth. The League
will do all in its power to protect the wattle
from the picnic vandal, and to encourage the
spread of the numerous beautiful species. A
wattle show will happen on September 5, at
Melbourne Town Hall, in conjunction with
the Royal Horticultural Society’s daffodil
spree. A public, celebration is to follow in
the evening, with nice flowery speeches.
Patriots are implored to wear a sprig of
blossom on the Golden First, and Senator
Findley has promised to try to get his col-
leagues to give the country a lead in that
respect.
The approach of “The Chocolate Soldier”
has caused town to be invaded by Sydney
chorus girls, who, so far as their dressing
goes, are early-edition heralds of Spring.
Ihe fur-clad Melbournite peeps sideways
from her winter armor at the visitors and
•admires their courage. At the same time,
knowing her climate, and not desiring to be
a late-edition pneumonia patient, she de-
cides that not yet will the moth get a chance
to dodge between the camphor lumps and
banquet on the muff and the stole.
The first flight of the oversea woolbuyers
arrived the other day by the tall ship Oster-
ley. These birds of passage usually enliven
the suburb they pitch their furnished villa
To ° war .y to wake the sleepy respecta-
bility of fashionable taverns, they form fours
or fives, rent a smart house, hire a motor,
and straightway turn their attention to busi-
ness—and pleasure. When the respectable
householders return to their Queen Anne, the
neighbors tell lurid tales of the revelry that
was. The Highly Respectables look properly
shocked; but they generally make a secret
note to let the shack again if possible, for
the wild and woollies pay handsomely.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—-
A travelling ’Murican has “discovered” a new
view for us. It is to be seen from the hills at the
back of Mitcham, where a sheer drop to the plains
reveals the whole of the Adelaide plain, from far
south beyond Brighton to the shadowy lines of the
northern hills. A good point about the find is that
it is the merest stroll from the Mitcham tram.
Mrs. E. T. Smith’s estate has been sworn for pro-
bate at £52,500. The bulk of it goes to relatives.
Another estate to enrich the Treasury of late is
that of Charles Geddes, of Port Pirie. By farming
and the timber trade he collected some £B2 000
and, incidentally, did a good deal for the advance-
ment of his town.
The storm occasioned by the appointment of 6X*
Bishop Wilson, of Melanesia, to .the rectorship of
Walkerville has died down. The suburb turned out
en masse the other night to toast its new cleric
with tea, and there wasn’t a hostile critic in the
bailiwick.
Talking of Bishops, the ecclesiastical residence
here has been the subject of some wrangling lately.
White-ant or dry rot or something got into it,
and someone began talking of re-building. There
was a composite howl from those who’d no wish to
see a modern “villa” take the place of the present
respectably solid pile. Compromise has decided on
under-pinning and a general tidying, so peace is
restored.
We got our Admiral back from Brisbane on Wed-
nesday, after sparing him to our neighbors for 10
days. Lady and Miss Bosanauet broke the journey
in Sydney; but Captain Fletcher journeyed from
here to the Victorian capital, and “personally con-
ducted” his Ex. home.
Editor Sowden, Who, as well as controlling the
destinies of the Register, has a large say in the
management of our Public Library and Art Gallery,
has just returned from a flying visit to the eastern
States. At Rupert Bunny’s exhibition he noted
several works, any one of which he considers might
be advantageously purchased for the local gallery.
We’ve said “good-bye” regretfully to Mrs.
Brough. The Lyric Club entertained her informally
during her stay.
The Hunt Club struck bad weather for its last
week’s run, but not even the opened flood-gates of
Heaven could prevent a cheerful crowd from swr,
bling at Richmond Park, where the popular Ald-
ridges dispensed beaming welcomes and steamintr
tea to some 200 guests.
Mrs. Box, secretary of the Queen Adelaide Club
has gone for a well-earned trip to Colombo. ’
The dilapidated condition of the West Terrace
cemetery is the theme of constant newspaper letters
and the last correspondent had a further grievance’
in that children pilfered flowers and odd gardening
tools from the graves of the “dearly departed.” Is
this a protest against doctors and undertakers’
fees, or what? Talking of graves, that cheerful
column of the dailies, devoted to “in loving
memory” notices, contained an original idea t’other
day. when a picture of the tomb appeared along
with the tearful poem.
Among houses to change hands of late is that
which belonged to the late “Tony” Fotheringham
of Menindie. The purchaser is A. A. Scarfe. ’
Opponents of the Outer Harbor scheme were given
fresh data for their case last week, when the Oster-
ley was two and a-half hours’ late in arriving, and
12 in leaving. Owing to a strong north-west wind
the passengers spent a more or less happy night
bumping beside the wharf.
Mayor Cohen has explained his attitude re the
Sheffield Choir. Said he: “The line must be drawn
somewhere, and a civic welcome should not be given
when it is sought in the main as a cheap advertise-
ment.” He also hinted that the reception had not
been any too courteously or tactfully asked for.
,Passed out at Kapunda Hospital iast week, Henry
Holroyd, aged 82 years, and a colonist since ’49.
He was a fine and courteous old citizen, who varied
gold-digging, surveying and pastoral work with
literature and writing. Amongst other things, he
was credited with knowing all about horses and
dogs.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

Misery after Meals
♦
This Woman's Life Made
Miserable by Indigestion —
How She was Cured*
“Some time back I became subject to pains
in my chest and in my right side,” said Mrs.
E. McGuinness, 63 Alfred Street, Prahran,
Vic. “I found that my food was beginning
to disagree with me. Almost as soon as I’d
taken a meal it would lie cold and heavy on
my chest, as if it wouldn’t go any further,
and I’d have a tender, sore feeling right from
the chest to the back, and particularly under
the left shoulder blade. I began to diet my-
self. and was careful not to eat rich, heavy
things, but still the pain and inconvenience
came on. I’d wake up each morning with
such a thickly-coated tongue and a most un-
pleasant, sour, bitter taste, and my eyes so
heavy. I had no energy at all. And such
sick headaches would come on, lasting per-
haps a couple of days at a time. My temples
would throb violently, so that I had to put
on bandages soaked in vinegar and water. 1
felt tired and run down all the time, and my
skin became very sallow. If I stooped, I
would feel quite dizzy. At last, through,
reading of a cure that seemed very like mine,
I tried a course of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills,
taking three a day and one at night time,
and they picked me up completely. I began
soon to shake off the weakness, and my food
began to agree with me again. Before Id
finished the third box I noticed I was much
brighter and brisker, and I’d feel the head-
aches not so severe. I kept on with the
medicine, and after six boxes was quite well.
My appetite and color came back, and I have
kept well ever since.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are 2s. 9d. a box,
six boxes 15s. 3d., of all dealers, or from the
Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co. of Australasia
Ltd., Sydney.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Some time ago the Maoriland Government
took in hand a block of waste and, according
to that croaksome bird, Private Enterprise,
worthless land, and proceeded to cultivate
it on scientific lines for fruit culture. The
experiment was a complete success, and the
Government then decided to let Private En-
terprise sit down, as usual, in the unearned
comfort. Recently 10 sections, planted and
ready for next season’s market, were opened
for selection, and the ballot was rushed by
about 250 scrambling anti-Soshers, practi-
cally all of them ready to take an affidavit
that Capital is being driven out of the coun-
try because of the meddling interference, etc.
John Bull’s “cheap loaf” is dough.
Poor David Storey, the hatter, desper-
ately eager for office, laid himself out to
help Wade defeat Labor in Mudgee and
Liverpool Plains, and threw all his alleged
Independence overboard. Henceforth he is
David Wade’s Tory.
The other day, at Birmingham, Lloyd
George, J. Bull’s Treasurer, was speaking
on the lot of the British worker, and, in
the course of his address, declared: “The
wolves of hunger prowl constantly around
millions of doors in this favored land.”
Amid the faint cheering that followed that
poetic assertion, there was heard a small
voice exclaiming, “ ’Ear! ’Ear! Blessin’s
of Freetrade!”
The Stanford-Merthyr coal miners
(N.S.W.) have protested against compul-
sory training for Defence “because they have
nothing to fight for.” Apart from the fact
that a good many of them have wives and
daughters, they might as well go back a bit
and find out -why they have nothing to fight
for. Put in very plain language, it is be-
cause somebody else tvas trained to do the
fighting.
. China has declared for the compulsory train-
ing of students of primary and secondary
schools in gymnastics, military drill and shoot-
mg. Sydney Telegraph, in its worship of
effete superstitions, merely because they are
worshipped at ’ome, clings to the theory dis-
carded even by Mongolia. And this, too,
when it has been stated by the chief officer
of Britain s recruiting staff, that more than
,)() per cent, of the recruits for the regular
army are unemployed. In other words, the
Telegraph’s recruiting agent is, not patriot-
ism, but starvation.
Henry Willis. having accepted the
Speakersnip of the N.S.W. Assembly, it is
rumored that four of the undependable “In-
dependents ’ have more or less guaranteed
the Labor Government a majority till the
end ot the present Parliament. Though no
one (in Parliament) wants a dissolution,
there will he much stage thunder over this
arrangement; hut it will be secretly ap-
plauded, all the same, because Wade’s fol-
lowers have been cursing in their beards
over the mess he has got them into. They
saw the gulf of dissolution yawning before
them, with probably no return ticket for
many of them; and anything is better than
that.
M riting of the dead Cardinal, the Sydney
Telegraph (17/S/T1) said:—
To most men there comes a period of their lives
when the march of progress goes past them. And in
such cases the stronger the man the more promin-
ently anachronistic is the figure that lie presents.
From the Telegraph, which opposed Feder-
ation, citizen service, an Australian navy,
Arbitration and Conciliation, “Socialistic
legislation” and a “Yes” vote on the Refer-
enda questions, that remark concerning the
essentially progressive-minded cleric who
advocated every one of them, is a superb
example of “hide.”
THE TREE AND THE FRUIT
THEREOF.
DAD BULL: “ Ok, Sonny, I've had an awful
time—they attacked me like dogs! ”
SONNY : “ Yes, dad—but haven't they been
housed and treated like dogs?”
Even on the Westralian goldfields there is
the blazing absurdity of two mayors and
two sets of aldermen and two cupboards in
the “mayor’s parlor,” where one of each
would do better. Kalgoorlie and Boulder
are the rivals—such deadly rivals that the
two mayors‘used to snort when they met in
the streets. A foreign-owned tram co. is
allowed to charge fid. for carrying pas-
sengers a few yards across the dividing line;
but each crowd puts up with the imposition
because it makes the people buy their beer
in their own township’s pubs. When Kal-
goorlie spends Is. in entertaining the visit-
ing pugilist, Boulder pulls out a florin to
look better. Naturally the two municipalities
have become almost stone-broke; councillors
can t sleep o’ nights ; town clerks and staffs
are asked to work for honor and glory ; and
bailiffs have become a nightmare.
The Weary Willie Government has
drafted a Midwives Bill, enacting that the
ladies shall hold certificates, “one of the ob-
jects aimed at being the suppression of mal-
practice.” It isn’t the trained and quali-
fied nurses, though, who indulge in this
brand of murder; it is frowsy and incompe-
tent Betsies who could not make a living
by honest nursing. They won’t seek certi-
ficates or publicity any more than they do
now; but, all the same, they won’t retire
from business. The only thing that will
render them unemployed is a place where a
girl “in trouble” can get out of it in the
way nature intended, and can afterwards
leave the consequences there and depart;
and that means a Maternity and Foundling
Hospital. Doubtless this would shock the
Wowsers; but the Wowsers love being
shocked, so that wouldn’t matter.
They wifi be gibing next at the Wes-
tralian State Parliamentary party that it
“doesn’t represent the real workers.” Among
the candiuates selected to give the Wilson-
Gregory Government a bad time at the next
elections are two farmers, one school-teacher,
one solicitor, a town clerk, a chemist and
an agent or two. It is becoming pretty hard
work for Fat to get home his favorite gag
that the Labor party represents a class and
stands for class legislation.
Leonard M. Isitt, the parson who has
been elected by Christchurch North to fill
the gap, left by “Tommy” Taylor in the
Maoriland Reps., will do little more than
draw attention to the size of the gap. For
years he has been one of the Dominion’s
chief Cold Tea apostles, and without intend-
ing to do anything of the sort has been driv-
ing the general public from the closed pubs
to the keg in their own homes. Like Taylor
he will generally be found behind the Bor-
rownet in divisions.
During the Mudgee (N.S.W.) by-election
Colonel Onslow was smitten heavily over the
leasehold business. Goslow had been shout-
ing for “freeholds for farmers” at the top of
his voice, and picturing the uncertainties
and other miseries of the leasehold system,
when Acting-Treasurer Carmike broke in
with the cold remark that the Colonel and
his family own the -whole country-side about
Camden, and lease the lot to the highest
bidders. Then the Waverley warrior had
to set to work to show that what was good
Onslow policy couldn’t possibly be good
State policy.
A while ago Attorney-General Denny (S.A.)
introduced the Veto Bill, which provides that
a measure twice passed by the Assembly,
with a general election intervening, shall be-
come law whether the House of Landlords
assents or not. This is intended as a
means to end the long struggle for the broad-
ening of the Council franchise —a reform
which has been persistently blocked by the
Council itself. The Labor Government,
being a practical crowd, says that it is tired
of banging its head against a stone wall,
wherefore it announces that, if the House
of Fat Landlords defeats this attempt, it
will be obliged to go straight to the British
Government, and ask the power which
granted the original Constitution to help in
bringing the machine up to date.
Henry Willis, M.L.A., who, by agreeing
to accept the Speakership in the N. S.
Wales Assembly, upset for the severalth
time the clumsy tactics of Calamity Wade,
V.C., and David Storey, hatter, was born
in S. Aus., but started to address the multi-
tude as a lay preacher under Anglican rules
at Mudgee (N.S.W.). He sat in two
Federal Parliaments in the House of Reps.,
but only with sufficient distinction to be
shot on his third appearance at the ballot
box. However, at the last State elections
he was able to capture a “Liberal” seat in
the “Smalls” House, and in Macquarie-
street he has usually adopted the role of
schoolmaster. “In the higher Legislature
to which 1 have been accustomed,” he scolds,
in effect, “an intelligent person knew
exactly where he was ; but your Parliament,
and your standing-orders, and your way of
conducting business would give an intelli-
gent person the pip.” So, now, if there are
any intelligent persons in the Assembly,
they ought to come into their own.
It didn’t take long for the ARGUS-sown
seed of a huge road-loan policy to germinate
in the spongy brains of the Gippsland farm-
ers. Last week the municipal councillors
of that province met and decided to ask
Weary, Willie and Co. to appoint a “de-
velopment Trust,” lend it a round million
and tell it to bog in. These mostly land-
owning councillors reckoned 3f per cent, in-
terest and 1| per cent, sinking fund' a fair
thing, and as that means £52,500 per an-
num, they were willing to forego their share
of the municipal subsidy—about £20,000 —
the Government to find the balance! It is
a great scheme, and when the rest of the
State has gone on the same loan racket, it
will dawn on Gippsland that it has to pay
interest and sinking-fund itself. At least it
will, as long as it pays anything; after that,
the kid will shoulder the burden, and trudge
along a long-since worn-out road with the
interest on the I O U.
Labor Minister Millar intends to ask the
Maoriland Parliament during the current
session to amend the Conciliation and Arbi-
tration Act to provide that an award on a
dispute in one district may become a com-
mon rule throughout the islands. Hitherto,
much waste of time and general irritation
have resulted from the fact that awards
could not be made to extend beyond the
bounds of their special districts. Millar is
also proposing some changes in the Workers'
Compensation Act. He wants to make em-
ployers pay something towards the doctor's
bill, the whole of which is at the present
time loaded on to the injured worker. An-
other important provision suggested is that
when an accident is fatal, or results in total
disablement, compensation must be pad
even if the accident is due to misconduct on
the part of the victim—just as an insur-
ance office pays up even though the policy -
holder has tried to drop off a tram in violent
motion.
THE DEFEAT OF THE ALLIES.
As another step towards absolutely free
education in S. Aus., the Government is
about to provide State school children with
all requisite books at a cost of £26,000 a
year. There is quite a strong party in the
Assembly anxious to make the University
free, and that will probably be the next
important step—if good seasons continue.
The New Protection and its dumb oppon-
ents came under discussion last week at the
opening of a Melbourne paint and varnish
factory, where Minister Tudor gave the new
machinery a start. Charles Atkins, the good
and pushful Australian who runs this show,
was only an importer of machine oil in the
first instance, but is now spreading himself
on the local production of dry colors and
varnish. There is any quantity of Aus-
tralian ochre to be had, but such things
when ground and treated are insufficiently
protected against the imported stuff. When
Atkins raised his tariff question, Tudor
spoke feelingly about those other manufac-
turers from whom he could not get any figures
concerning profits and wages. His inquiring-
circular addressed to “775 manufacturers in
one industry” had not fetched a single reply.
The silent 775 live in hope, seemingly, of
some further Protection that will benefit
only themselves, and they will do or saj
nothing meanwhile that might advance th<
interests of wage-earners on New Protectioi
lines.
SOFT-SOAP FOR LADIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. A. Robinson, referring to the proposed scheme
of amalgamation of the various Liberal leagues in
Victoria, said it was a matter that needed careful
consideration. To bring women into an organisation
which should consist of men only, might have the
effect of seriously impairing it. Women did the
best work when they were left alone. With a joint
committee there was not the same efficiency as with
separate committees. For the past seven years the
Women’s National League had held the field.—
Daily paper.
Dear ladies, 1 implore you, for your own sake [and
for ours],
Do not seek amalgamation with us men ;
In the past you have been peerless,
And your methods, strong and fearless,
Still compel our admiration, now as then.
Our courage is as strong as in the past [or nearly
so] ;
And, as yet, we do not fear to stand alone;
But you still may aid us greatly
By-er-canvassing, as lately,
And, pray, let us do the rest upon our own.
[Good Lord! We can’t allow these cats to interfere
with us !
They’re hard enough to manage where they are, with
all their fuss.
At rounding up the snobbish vote they’re quite a
useful lot;
But, admit ’em to our inner councils? AA’hew ! I
reckon not!]
For many years, dear ladies, we’ve done nothing but
admire
Your drawing-room assemblies and your teas.
You’ve a gift for organising,
And your canvassing’s surprising—
Mere men possess no qualities like these.
Your knowledge of political economy is great;
Your arguments, advanced as they can be.
Do not think we would resist you,
Nay, we’re anxious to assist you
At your meetings by-er-passing cakes and tea.
[AVhew! I hope that we can choke them off their
latest little scheme,
If they knew our inmost secrets they’d get on the
chairs and scream.
They’d simply kill the Party—-such a wild, erratic
mob.
AVhat would they think if they knew, say, of Smith-
son’s little job!]
I earnestly assure you, you can aid us men-folk best
By remaining in a body as you are,
In the interests of the nation;
For, I think association
With the men, on finer minds, is apt to jar.
There are certain little matters—oh, not secrets t
Dear me, no.
You’re acquainted with our e’vry aim and act—
But-er-certain little matters
That would wear your nerves to tatters
If you had to grapple with-er-sordid fact.
[Jee-rusalem! I hope I can persuade ’em to keep
out!
AVhat sort of Party meetings would we have with
them about?
Best prime ’em up with Busted Homes and Shat-
tered Marriage Ties.
They’re keen on propagating such old, crusted Tory
lies.]
Dear ladies, you have always been the Labor party’s
dread ;
It fears you as it fears no other thing.
All our wrongs will soon he righted,
If you stand firm and united,
And to the Sacred Truth, as ever, cling.
Remember, Socialism is a monster in disguise,
AVhich seeks to leg'slate for class alone.
But your association
Stands for all the blessed nation
And the people’s good—which means —cr —means
our own.
[l’d like to know who smarted this amalgamation
craze ;
They certainly are useful in a hundred little ways;
But a pack of foolish cacklers at our councils!
Goodness me!
AYhy, there wouldn’t be a Party if they knew os
much as we.]
VICTORIA.
SEN.
THE LAST CAPITALIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The world is grown extremely old,
And furrowed, dry and grey;
About a sun fast turning cold
It winds its weary way ;
And where the ice comes creeping through
Upon a lonesome land
Where once the tropic orchids grew,
Two shrivelled mortals stand.
The last are they upon the earth,
And each with age is bowed.
There’s little left of any worth;
The snow a final shroud
Is weaving for all worldly things;
A shadow, dun and drear,
As from the all-embracing wings
Of death, is drawing near.
One speaks, ill-covered and ill-fed:
“I will no longer moil
Without my own fair share of bread,
The product of our toil.”
The other frowns. “Talk not,” says he,
“This socialistic tripe.
We can’t have crude equality,
The time is not yet ripe.”

sickness, creating

“I am only too

“For years I was subject to severe attacks,
but recently they have become quite rare.
At times I had excruciating pains behind the
shoulder blades, deep feelings of depression,
and felt entirely unable to do my work. 1
felt irritable and out of sorts generally, j
took many kinds of medicines, but until i
commenced taking Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills the attacks lasted for days. Only
yesterday I had a slight attack, having eaten
something that did not agree with me; but
I took a couple of the pills last night, and
to-day I feel splendid—without a vestige ot

therefore conscientiously recommend them.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
An unexpected winner at Flemington last
Saturday was the 3-year-old St. Vano, who captured a
7-furlong handicap in good style. The youngster re-
ceived plenty of weight—2olb.—from Twa Brigs
(who ran second) and others; but his breeding on the
dam’s side suggests that staying rather than sprinting
should be his game. The dam is Vanity Fair, a
mean-looking animal that was “placed” one year in
the Melbourne and Caulfield Cups.

The Bananaland Government proposed to
bar the raucous, non-productive layer of odds from
racecourses; but the House of Fat struck the idea
out by 12 to two, only the Ministers voting for the
proposal. The House of Fat thus put itself in
its proper class as the champion of those who do
nothing useful.

Adelaide Racing Club pushed off the first
day of the Grand National meeting on Saturday, with
a glorious advt. for the totalisator. The boodle
passed into the machine reached £20,529 —a jump
of £5OOO over last year’s effort. Throughout the
day good “first” divs. were paid out; but, when
Eager returned a “second” div. of £22 55., and Mor-
ganite paid £7 10s. for a similar position, the joy
of punters was extremely great. Such results may
yet knock the scales from the eyes of punters and
racecourse proprietors in N.S.W. and Victoria, and
may even convince the Bananaland House of Fatty
Degeneration that Ikey Noses is a superfluity.

“0.K.”: At Caulfield, the other Saturday,
I looked for evidence in support of “Pro-Book’s”
contention that punters derive much joy from hear-
ing their fancy gee-gees shorten in market price
after they (the early punters) have “got on.” I
found a heavy weight of evidence on the side of
Sorrow in its contest with Joy. Where the
books opened proceedings with 4 to 1 on
the field, and two horses were backed at
that figure, the odds presently expanded to 9 to 2
on the field, and one of the original selections fell
back to the 6 to 1 mark. Similar retrograde move-
ments were the rule in other minor events. Also, I
took notes of the book quotations for the Australian
Steeplechase, in order to compare them with reports
of starting prices in Monday’s newspapers. The odds
mostly offered against Field Trial were 6 to 1. Here
and there a cry of 7 to 1 could be heard amidst the
babel. Leah Kleshna (who ran second) was a 10 to
1 chance with every odds merchant I visited, save
one who said “8 to 1 to you, sir!” in the tone of a
bargain salesman. And he was in a big way of
business, too. The newspapers reported Field Trial
at B’s and Leah Kleshna at 12’s. The winner, Con-
cave, got credit for a 12 to 1 starting price, and this
likewise was two points higher than the average
quotation roared in the ring. I wonder how many
backers of Concave on the course had the joy of
getting more than 12 to 1 ?
Old Melbourne print, J. J. Miller’s
Racing Chronicle, is dead, and J.J.M. makes his
collection appeal and funeral notice in one:—
“IN MEMORIAM.
DIED, at the Age of 16 years. From want of
sufficient sustenance,
J. J. MILLER’S RACING CHRONICLE.
We mourn our loss (financially).
There are liabilities —Arrears for the unfortunate
Editor’s Salary, Funeral Expenses, etc. An early
response for the above amount, now due, will very
much oblige.”
Maoriland’s Grand National Steeplechase,
at Christchurch, was notable for the win of the 12-
year-old Paritutu, who, after a strenuous career on
the flat, was put to the jumping biz. The favorite,
Corazon, was second; Antarctic, highly fancied, was
third. Paritutu has 19 firsts and 24 seconds out of
125 tries, or alleged tries, in 10 seasons. G. N.
Hurdles fell to a strong favorite in Continuance.

The Stevenson-Lindrum billiard match in
Melbourne ended in an easy win for Lindrum
(receiving 4000 in 18,000). The Englishman
gained only 436 points on the young player,
and had thus scored 14,436 when the other ran out.
A match on the same terms is being played in Syd-
ney this week.
There is now no apparent reason why the
world’s billiard championship, whereof Stevenson is
the nominal holder, should not be contested in Aus-
tralia before Fred Lindrum leaves for England. To
those who watched them in the latter stages of their
game in Melbourne, it was hard to believe that the
veteran visitor had actually scored a lot more points
than Lindrum during the first week, and had at one
time been actually ahead of him on their handicap
terms. Towards the finish Stevenson’s pretensions to
give 4000 in 18,000 to the young ’un were reduced
1.0 ridicule. He sat disconsolate, for instance, whilst
Lindrum made breaks of 265 and 166 (unfinished) in
two successive cues; and this without resorting to
the “Gray stroke,” which, if he had been at liberty
to play it for its full scoring worth, would have put
the English nominal champion into the shade. He
played the “3 ball game,” as it is called, and
equalled or beat Stevenson in every department of it
save one. Thus far he doesn’t manage a nursery of
cannons with the delicate touch and old experience
of the specialist, but in all other respects he is as
clever as the other man, and less conservative. Ste-
venson seems to break down repeatedly through try-
ing to keep within a groove of play at the top of
(.he table. He botches the situation for himself by
his niggling tactics, whereas Lindrum is ready to
sacrifice a difficult chance to do something wonderful
in favor of a more simple game which may offer
further possibilities of a big break. In fact, the
Australian is a more resourceful all-round player than
the champion, and could be backed to play him on
level terms to-morrow if the restriction on the
“Gray stroke” were somewhat relaxed. Ordinary
championship rules put no restriction on the “Gray
stroke.”
The 87th football tussle between N.S.W.
and Queensland supplied the Rugby Union bill of
fare at University Oval (Sydney) on Saturday; and
8000 patronised the affray. The players’ luck was
in, as a shower of rain bad softened the bumps on
the ground, thereby enabling all hands to side-step
the scars that are generally the prizes of football.
It was an even game in the first half, which ended
8 all; but in the second section N.S.W. climbed
over the Bananalanders, and lifted the tally to 34
points to 14. In the second half, therefore, the
home team amassed 26 points against the Northerners’
6. The N.S.W. three-quarters out-manoeuvred their
opponents badly, and Mayo and Dean piled up three
tries each, the other tries being scored by Griffin
and Pugh (of the forwards) ; while Reynolds booted
three goals over the bar, and Ward Prentice kicked
two. On Queensland’s behalf, Tucker and Pill
(what’s in a name!) were the most useful; but the
team, as a whole, was below the Bananaland
standard of late years.
The other Union matches of the day were spark-
ling titbits. City and Suburban (Sydney) were a
trifle too good for Central Western, and demolished
them by 11 points to 6 ; while the argument between
Metropolis and New England ended with the scores
level, 6 points each.
League Rugby in Sydney on Saturday
didn’t shift the order of the top-dogs. The match
on which most depended was South Sydney v.
Western Suburbs; Souths trampled Wests out of
recognition by 20 points to 7. In the other strug-
gles, Glebe made a lunch of Balmain (41 to 2) ;
Eastern Suburbs squeezed out ahead of Annandale
by 8 points to 5 ; and North Sydney defeated New-
town by 17 to 12. The result of the play leaves
Glebe and South Sydney level with 20 points each,
Eastern Suburbs close on their heels with 18, New-
town 13, and the others in the soup. Next Satur-
day will conclude the second round; after which
the leaders will battle in the final on September 2.
Up to last week-end, “Dally” Messenger’s
kicking in this season’s Sydney Rugby League pre-
miership matches, on behalf of Eastern Suburbs, had
resulted in 44 goals out of 48 recorded by the club.
This booting energy yielded 88 points out of 205
scored —over 40 per cent, of the^total.
After being held up since July 15 by inter-
state matches and other excuses, the Australian Rulers
kicked vigorously in Sydney on Saturday. Sydney
downed East Sydney by 69 points to 29; Y.M.C.A.
raged like the heathen, and slew Newtown by 78
to 25; and South Sydney wiped out North Shore
by 73 to 32. As the outcome of the day’s turmoil,
Y.M.C.A. (last year’s premier club) creeps into the
final four —Sydney, East Sydney, Newtown and
Y.M.C.A.
This season’s Soccer in Sydney can’t pro-
vide much more excitement. Balmain has pushed its
claim to the Rawson Cup still further, by beating
Canterbury, 3-0. The competition table stands:
Balmain 22 points, Granville 18. So Balmain has
now only to tie the next match to win the Cup.
Granville, by downing Newtown (2-0), has qualified
for the third round in the Gardiner Cup, for which
the final will be played about September 9. The
Association pannikin already belongs to the coal-
mine suburb.

After the carnival interlude, Vic. League
’bailers resumed their contests, the chief episode
being the collision of ’Roy and South. The latter
had to win to have a hope of being on top at the
end of the round, and ’Roy likewise needed victory
to reach the final four, wherefore a strenuous and
somewhat discourteous game ensued. It was even
pegging till the last quarter, when Souths set out
on the business of the day, promptly won two goals
and a few behinds, and then played for safety. The
Maroons stuck to it gamely, and snatched one goal;
but time and South’s defence blocked further efforts,
and the disturbance ended—South 36 points; ’Roy,
27. An unseemly item was the fact that ’Roy’s bar-
rackers persistently jeered the umpire—a " former
Collingwood player—on the presumption that he
was favoring South in the interests of ’Wood. The
point was that, if ’Wood and ’Roy could win the
three remaining matches, ’Roy would beat ’Wood for
the final on percentages of points scored ; but ’Wood
had already grasped this fact, and was piling up 98
points to 9 against ’Varsity. That game was of
no interest to critical spectators, but was a joy to
one-eyed barrackers. The other episodes were but
side-shows, Essendon beating St. Kilda by 158 to
38 ; Carlton outing Geelong by 71 to 51, and Rich-
mond (51) and Melbourne (60) indulging in a skir-
mish that mattered to nobody.
In the Ass. the long-drawn struggle be-
tween Brunswick and Port, for fourth place, still
continues, and will only end when the round ends
this week. Both won on Saturday, ’Wick beating
Brighton by 75 to 45, and Port downing ’Seray by
58 to 43. This leaves ’Wick some 20 points to the
good on their scores, and, as the Brickies meet Pres-
ton next Saturday, while Port tackles Brighton, the
odds are a shade in favor of ’Wick. Essendon got
its second beating this season, this time at the feet
of North —60 to 34. The winners—last season’s
premiers, by the way—are in such financial straits
that the club has been passing round the hat. The
players see, however, that the only thing that brings
in oof is success, and plenty of it, and they are
bogging in accordingly. P’ran and Preston and
’Town and ’Cote are understood to have collided
somewhere, but the results are of no account.
The 10-days’ football carnival in Adelaide
(Australian rules) drew a gate of £2038, which is
more than was taken in Melbourne on the last oc-
casion. The visiting teams (every State but Queens-
land) and council delegates (every State and Maori-
land) get their expenses paid. That meant £1025.
Another £ 500 was spent in entertaining them ; the
five States that competed get a dividend of £6O
each; and the small balance goes to the ‘ Oval, where
all the matches were played.
* * * *
Adelaide (0.A.) football, on Saturday,
had a record in close finishes. Port Adelaide
crawled out ahead of Sturt by 66 points to 65 ; South
Adelaide defeated West Torrens by 57 to 56; and
Norwood accounted for North Adelaide by 47 to 42.
It was an afternoon too strenuous for weak hearts
and sore heads.
Langford and Johnson, who are to fight
in Australia for the world’s championship, leave
America for Sydney on September 6. Make-the-
Splosh is promoter. The white race will not get
much satisfaction out of the match, as both com-
petitors are coons.

Hughie Mehegan intends to make a dash
after the boodle during the next few months. Fol-
lowing the fight with Charlie Griffin, he is to argue
the point in the following 13 weeks with Keys, Read,
Picato, McCoy and Cullen. By the time the sturdy
Australian gets through this menu he will probably
be quite ready to ask some gentleman to say grace
after meat.

Charters Towers (N.Q.) has a lightweight
boxer named Barney Saunders, who is a bit above
the ordinary. He met Rev. Hulton Sams in the
final of the amateur lightweight championship of
North Queensland at the Towers the other night,
and at the end of the prescribed four rounds the
judges couldn’t give a decision, so they ordered an-
other round. The parson got the better of this, but
the committee was so pleased with Saunders’s show-
ing that it awarded him a special medal. This is
the first time that the Rev. Sams has been shaken
up to any extent in this country by a man of his
own weight.
Word comes from Noo Yark that the
grievously miscalled “Cyclone” Johnny Thompson,
who whirled with moderate success in Sydney last
season, has been beaten on points by Frank Klaus,
of Pittsburg, in 10 rounds.
Io put an end to the wrangle which
started when Donaldson failed to toe tne mark in
the recent footrace, he and Yankee C. E. Holway
will meet for the world’s 130yds. sprint champion-
ship at Sydney Sports Ground on September 23.
The Rugby League will father the event, and fill in
the afternoon with side-shows; and, as a. substanti ..
deposit is put up by each athlete, a genuine race cu.i
probably be expected. Other professional matches
fixed up for the near future include one between Hol-
way and Postle, and another between Donaldson and
Postle; and the desire to catch the elusive “gate”
while the sport is lukewarm is therefore being well
attended to.

As a lung-stretcher for the N.S.W. cross-
country championship race, to be held next Satur-
day, East Sydney A.A.C. controlled a five-mile cross-
country event last Saturday. A host of athletes
faced the starter, and, at the other end, T. J. Wood
maintained his consistent form by romping in 20yds.
ahead of C. Weyman and F. Terry. As 16 athletes
finished within two minutes of the winner, the cross-
country struggle promises to be more interesting than
usual.
Queensland Amateur Athletic Assoc, last
week upheld the protest of the Toowong Harriers
against the victory of Redfern (N.S.W.), in the
recent Bananaland cross-country championship, owing
to some of the team being missed in the count by
the judges; and the re-shuffle pushes Toowong into
first place, while Redfern and East Brisbane drop
into the second and third holes. As the Banana-
landers join in the N.S.W. cross-country race on
Saturday, the Redfern band will have its chance of
revenge.
The Queensland tennis tourney was con-
cluded on Saturday. The previous week N.S.W. gents
went down to Bananaland by 15 rubbers to 6, and
Queensland ladies defeated Ma’s girls by 5 rubbers
to 4. Yet, last week, when the individual champion-
ships were played, Mother won everything; Rice
(N.S.W.) and Parker (N.S.W-), the holder, were left
in the final; and Rice came out on top by 4-6, 9-7,
6-2, 6-1. The ladies’ championship went to Mrs.
Ford (N.S.W.), who beat the holder, Miss Macintosh
(Q.) —6-3, 6-1. And Rice and Parker (N.S.W.), by
beating St. John and Thorlow (Q ; .) —4-6, 8-6, 6-4,
6-3 —won the gents’ double championship also.
Australia can have the Davis Cup this
year so far as England is concerned. The Fog isn’t
sending a good team to battle for it; but if Amurka
gets the utensil, then J. Bull promises to put his
best tennis foot for’ard.

N.S.W. Lawn Tennis Association altered
the waistcoat of its constitution last week, by in-
serting a gusset to allow a “majority” to control its
affairs; otherwise it will face the world again robed
in all its old apparel. The change will no doubt
result in the opening of the courts at Double Bay
(Sydney) for Sunday tennis. If this doesn’t save
the Association financially, the undertaker will be
called in.

The Dunlop inter-club premiership on
the Homebush (Sydney) roadway, on Saturday,
pushed traffic on the footpath to make room for io
cyclists and a bundle of pacemakers. At the end
of a slashing 30-mile race, Redfern gathered in the
shield, with 16 points against Marrickville’s 20 ;
and the shield therefore finds a new resting-place.
The journey was done in lhr. 19min. 30sec. ; and,
as clubinates Cutcliffe and Kirk dead-heated for the
honor of first past the post, Redfern gathered all the
glory. The winning team has been the runner-up a
couple of times, so the win is a cheery reward for
pluck and consistency.
“Teuf-Teuf” : The A. T. Craig, widely ad-
vertised by the Benz car people as having made
some remarkable wins at the Brooklands track, is of
the Melbourne firm of Craig, Williamson. His car
will probably be longer remembered at Brooklands
for its performance of the aeroplane act. It was
being driven on that occasion by Wilkinson, and
after a ding-dong finish swooped up the bank, travel-
ling at something like 100 miles an hour, shot over
the edge, and soared away in a clean 150 ft. jump,
crashing through a tree in its flight. The tree
saved the driver by hooking him from the seat and
dropping him through the undergrowth, about 50ft.
from where the car “took off.” A Benz, by the
way, was amongst the first motor arrivals in Aus-
tralia, 15 years ago. It had solid tyres, tiller steer-
ing, and a speed of 10 miles per hour. The car is
still running, and was in the streets of Melbourne
recently.
* * * *
The really modern motor-cycle appears to
be just about as reliable as the one of three or four
seasons ago was erratic. In a recent 24 hours’
scamper from London to Edinburgh, of 96 starters
only eight failed to complete, and most of those
failures were through accidents. The distance is 400
miles or thereabouts.
An English-built car was recently sub-
jected to a 15,000-miles test on Brooklands track,
and some interesting figures were dug out of it. In-
cluding 83 miles from shed to track, the total dis-
tance covered was 15,008 miles. In the 14,925
miles of track-running an average speed of 34.7
rn.p.h. was maintained. The time spent in adjust-
ments—apart from cleaning sparking plugs—was
under 18min., and, at the end of the run, the worn-
out parts could have been replaced for under £2.
The engine was oiled once a day, the average daily
mileage being 300. The petrol consumption was
a gallon for every 23 miles; oil consumption one
gallon per 1184 miles. The motorist’s misfortune
is that he can’t take the Brooklands track with him
when he goes touring.
Lately Jake de Rosier, on the Brook-
lands track, put up two motor-cycle records, viz.,
flying kilometre (1093yd5.) in 26 l-ssec., equal to
about 85.3 miles per hour; and flying five miles in
3min. 43sec. (80.7 miles per hour). And at the
same time the flier equalled his own 41 l-ssec. for
the mile (=87.3 miles per hour).
Australian amateur champion TD. W.
Schneider is still riding into places in big English
cycle races, but seems to lack the final kick neces-
sary to get him over the line first. In the 10-mile
British Empire Championship on the Crystal Palace
track, he jumped away when there was a quarter of
a mile to go, but could not last out, and finished
only third, two lengths behind the winner, C. B.
Kingsbury.

When S. Aus. and Queensland met at
lacrosse in Brisbane, on Saturday, the slaughter of
the Northerners was complete—l 4 goals to 5. The
Moffat brothers attacked vigorously for S. Aus., and
nearly all the goals were the result of their efforts;
while O. Thorpe gathered the glory on Queensland’s
behalf. On Monday, S. Aus. trampled on Bananaland
11. by 11 goals to 6, so the Crow-eaters’ long jour-
ney northwards had its reward.
* * * *
N.S.W. was crumpled up by Victoria in
the inter-State lacrosse match at Petersham (Sydney)
on Saturday—ls goals to 1. There have now been
10 tussles betwen the teams, and Victoria has
scooped the lot. N.S.W. played well throughout the
afternoon, but Gursonsky’s defence for Victoria regu-
larly obstructed the dashes when a score appeared a
certainty. The solitary goal to N.S.W. was scored
by Mallett, the reward of playing the finest game on
the side. As the Victorians defeated South Aus. be-
fore they crossed over, scoring 6 goals to 5, the Aus-
tralian championship isn’t likely to drop from their
grasp. * * *
Sydney baseball on Saturday had a big
bearing on the result of the premiership. Lane
Cove and Leichhardt (which occupied level seats at
the top of the table) clashed, and Leichhardt won
by 7 runs to 3. Leichhardt is therefore ahead now
with 18 points, while Petersham and Lane Cove are
on its heels with 16. Dethronement of Leichhardt
and a win to Petersham and Lane Cove next Satur-
day would even up three clubs; therefore the pre-
miership struggle is full of possibilities.
N.S.W. inter-State hockey team obliter-
ated the “Rest of N.S.W.” at Sydney, on Saturday, by
7 goals to 1, and departs this week for Melbourne,
where the Australian championship matches were
begun by Victoria narrowly defeating South Aus. bv
2 goals to 1. When Ma’s boys bog in, hair and skin
are expected to fly.
Major Philip Trevor discusses the hard
case of Tarrant at some length in London D.T. It
a first 11 of all the world had to be chosen, Tarrant,
he says, would certainly be in it without a dissent-
ing voice. England has the legal right to play him,
but should that right be exercised? The Major
answers the question in the negative. Suppose Eng-
land won the triangular tests with Tarrant’s assist-
ance, what would be the obvious and unanswerable
retort? “Yes, you’ve won, but you had to get an
Australian to beat the Australians.” As the Major
accurately puts it, the object of the triangular tests
is to ascertain which country produces—not procures
—the best cricketers. Consequently Tarrant, having
been born in Melbourne, and having learnt his
cricket there, should help Australia in the inter-
national competition, whereas by the laws which
control the game, he is only entitled to help Aus-
tralia’s principal opponent.
Secretary Wheeler, of the Adelaide
Y.M.C.A. being trained in American methods, in-
sisted on getting in a billiard table last year, to the
horror of some of his committee, who considered it
a kind of skating-rink to Hades. The table has
paid for itself already; the Good Young Men of
Adelaide have, in inter-State competitions, shown
themselves pretty warm with the cue; and —two
more tables have been ordered!
The Australian Jockey Club (Sydney)
has a few “old hands” on the committee. H. C.
Dangar and W. R. Hall have kept a seat thereon
since 1864, while George Lee and 11. Chisholm have
lent a hand for 18 and 16 years respectively. All
these four are “horsey” men and breeders.

Next Saturday Miss Gertie Lewis (holder)
and Mrs. E. Woodbridge, of Port Stephens (chal-
lenger), will splash on the Parramatta River for
the ladies’ sculling championship and £25 aside.
The race is to be in light 18ft. skiffs, over a two-
mile course, ending at the monument.

In London the towel is no longer waved
over the sitting boxer during the intervals. Instead,
his second points at him a brass cylinder, in which
reside a fan and a supply of ice.
They manage these things better in unso-
phisticated South Aus. A publican in a country
town lately organised ' a race meeting. He owned
a mare which had a big chance in one event; but,
as the course was too heavy for her to show her
top form, the fixture was postponed.
The Champs-Elysees, the great Parisian
thoroughfare, proves that motor-cars are the least
damaging species of traffic. The Champs is divided
into three tracks, the outer one for ordinary vehicles,
the middle one exclusively for motor-cars. It is
estimated that the daily traffic is 20,000 ordinary
vehicles and 30,000 motor-cars. Yet for every two
yards of repairs on the motor track there are eight on
the horse section; and the motor road needs practi-
cally no cleaning. The oil and grease drippings
from the cars protect the wooden blocks. On the
other hand, the ordinary horseshoe is a destruc-
tive weapon, and whether it lands on a man’s nose or
the surface of a wood-blocked street, it leaves its
mark all the time. #
Ever since motor-cars were invented Man
has been seeking the perfect light; and some of him
reckon that at last it has arrived. The new illum-
inant is a combination of incandescent disc, petrol
vapor and oxygen gas. The gas is mixed in a small
carburetter (the oxygen being supplied from a steel
cylinder) and projected through a special burner
on to the incandescent disc. It is known as oxy-
petrol, and is said to be a bobby-dazzler about 10
times cleaner and more reliable and brilliant than
acetylene.
“Con”: Toowoomba (Q.) footballers have
been left completely out of inter-State teams; vet,
upon meeting the N.S.W. reps, lately, the Dar-
ling Downers defeated them by 14 to 11. The
Walers are the lot that so ignominiously defeated
combined Queensland two days before, though they
had themselves been previously beaten by Central
Queensland (9 points to 6). Now, the point is
this: Hitherto the Queensland Rugby Union has for-
gotten the inland footballing centres of Queensland.
But how can it henceforward ignore the two teams
which licked Ma, when the Queensland team, com-
posed almost wholly of Brisbane players, and selected
without doubt from Queen-street, made such a dis-
graceful exhibition against the same crowd?

THE “CONFOMAT”
(It BOD.)
A Boon to Australians.
HIS Hat provides the acme of Comfort
and Luxury in headgear. Is unlike
the ordinary stiff felt hat. It con-
forms—as its name implies—to the wearer’s
head.
If you wear a “Confomat,” your head will
fit the hat —rather than the hat your head.
The head, of itself, makes the shape of the
Ilat. Nothing could be more delightful, easy
and comfortable. Headaches impossible.
Handmade by special process from choicest
materials. Exceptionally light and durable.
Fast-dyed. In all the latest shapes and styles.
Guaranteed to give complete satisfaction.
Price, 13/6 at all leading Stores throughout
Australia. The name “Confomat” is regis-
tered, and infringements will be dealt with
according to law.

New EDISON
Records for September
THE EDISON PHONOGRAPH never becomes out-of-date, because EDISON
RECORDS alway keep it up-to-date. The most recent successes of the
greatest artists may be heard on the Edison Phonograph almost at the
same time as they can be heard over the footlights—the same artists who make
the shows a success make the Edison a success.
We announce herewith the September Issue of New Edison Records. It con-
tains a number of particularly choice items; in fact, every number is a musical
treat. All the old favorites are represented. A FURTHER BATCH OF GRAND
OPERA AMBEROIi RECORDS is also included. They are worthy of note.
You should call on your nearest dealer and get him to let you hear these
new records. We can give you liis address if you do not know it. Write us
to-day, and we will also send you complete lists of machines and Records.

Peter Pen Points To Some
Facts About The ONOTO Pen
“About this Pen Question. I want to settle it
new, I'm Peter Pen—and I want to tell
you about the pride of the pen family.
“It doesn't teak. What a pen to have—the pen that
doesn’t leak.
“It doesn’t splutter, scratch or blot.
“It fills itself in a flash. Fancy that—no filler—no
squirt 4 it fills —all alone. It’s a pen on its own.
“ Peter Ten is looking for the men, women and children
who have writing to do—and do it without an
Onoto Pen.
“ Poor neglected scribes. llow much better to join the
ranks of the cheerful users, and on Peter Pen’s
advice, buy the British made

Another Australian Record
on the “Alcock” Table.
TO the remarkable series of record breaks by Gray, Roberts, Williams and
Lindrum, already performed on the “Alcock” Table, is added another record
by Lindrum. His latest achievement was in the Melbourne match with
Reece, when he secured the phenomenal break of 1239—1230 coming off the red
establishing two Australian records. All these champions have expressed their
high opinion of Alcock Tables, for huge breaks are only possible where the table
is “ true to angle,” with cushions, jaws and every other part absolutely perfect.
, , , Bot , h , Gray and Lindrum owe their present reputations largely to the
Alcock 1 able. It is on these tables they practised and made many of their
largest breaks. W e will gladly post you our illustrated Billiard Catalogue.

<owo Children
made well by
SCOTT’S
Emulsion
Their mother, Mrs. Delaney,
writes (9th June, 10) from
[da Villa, Meeks Road, Mar-
rickville, Sydney, N.S.W.,
:hat:
‘lda, aged 5, suffered continuously with
fgd
sore throat, and had great
difficulty in breathing, which
made her very irritable.
Enid, aged 2, had a severe
cough, which was very dis-
tressing at night, and pre-
vented her from sleeping,
and she could eat scarcely
anything. I tried Scott’s
Emulsion, and in a remark-
ably short time both were
completely cured. They are now quite
strong and well.”
The world-wide reputation
of Scott’s Emulsion as a
children's remedy gives you
a CERTAINTY which v no
other emulsion can provide.
No other emulsion is made
of the same pure and force-
ful ingredients, by the
unique Scott process of
manufacture. It is impossible
to exaggerate the importance
of this, where delicate, sensi-
tive children are concerned.
If you simply ask for “emul-
sion,” you run a grave risk
of getting an emulsion which
is not Scott’s, and may im-
peril your child’s health. Ask
for SCOTT’S EMULSION.

ANTINEURASTHIN,
THE only known effective remedy for nervous
breakdown or exhaustion, will be sent to any
address in Australia or New Zealand on receipt
of 2d. in stamps to cover postage.
In nervous breakdown the brain and nerve cells
must be FED, and not stimulated by medicines in
the form of tonics or sedatives, which give tempor-
ary relief, but cannot effect permanent improvement.
Antineurasthin is a
NERVE AND BRAIN FOOD.
It cures by feeding the brain and nerve cells with
their natural food element. Lecithin, in an active
organic state, and is the only known means of
effectively doing this. Its value is fully demon-
strated by its rapid and permanent effect upon the
nervous system and health generally; sound natural
sleep, improved digestion, power of application to
work, concentration of thought, and sound vigorous
mentality.

....Marco: “Australia First” knows the Ballarat
statue to Peter Lalor almost as well as he knows his
own bald head. But a statue in a country town,
erected by one admirer, isn’t quite a national me-
morial ....A.S.If. (and others): Glad to know that
there are some schools in N.S.W. where the Austra-
lian flag is f10wn.... Tiaki: Claim for it. .. .Annie
0. B.: Might do if you could put it into half a dozen
lines. .. .Navvy: Thanks; but the subject has been
forgotten by this time. . . .R.H.C.: Thanks. Do
you know all the jokes, gags, yarns, lies, etc., that
were ever told?. . . .P.S.: The poor little jest lias
toddled to the basket so often that it is on it’s uppers
n0w....J.D.: Joke evidently oozed out in transit.
.. . .E.J.H.W.: It is not Bulletin stuff.... W.W.
(Sydney): The widow is not winsome enough....
Dano: Too rough. You make your point, but only
after much labor. .. .C.J. (Sydney): Rhymed protest
against compulsory service created a Companion of
the Basket. .. .Will J. (V.) : Not enough in it....
Fair D. : The same point was scored in a recent
Bulletin picture. .. .Searchlight: Thin humor
Will R. (Q.) : Same old derelict.... Denys: Not an
attractive collection of sweets.... Bellerive: It is
Caroline’s turn: —
THE DUMB MAID.
A beautiful and fascinating Maid
As graceful as a queen Devine,
Of high and ancestral fame
Is the dumb maid Caroline :
Her eyes are blue and sparkling,
Her cheeks like a lily fair ;
Down her back in waving tresses
Hang her glittering golden hair;
Yet at times a cloud of sorrow
Shade the brow of the queen Devine,
A yearning for the power of speech
Doth sadden sweet Caroline.
....Waster: Sorry not good enough. Compliment
you on the discovery of “prore.” It is much better
than “prayed,” which is really half-brother to
“preyed.”.... Nib: Seems to be no particular reason
why you should keep on scribbling. But if you
must do it, do it in ink....H.W. (V.): Postpone
the funeral and send the indignant undertaker home.
You are too young to die artistically in verse. . . .
Selamon: Rather slight and not very well worked up.
. ...P.W. (V.): “I am enclosing a few original
verses.” One of them :
THOUGHTS.
How sad it is to be alone —-
To 'muse awhile and then bemoan
The chances we have missed in life —
So full of fears, so full of strife.
Your honest simplicity and directness of speech
spoil it. The experienced disher-up of old, old
themes would go at it in this manner:—
TO PIERRETTE, IN HIS AGONY.
Dear God! at the shuddering end to be left quite
alone!
To brood on the chances misused in the jostle
called Life !
With Sorrow for bedmate, unheard is my pitiful
moan !
I look for the dawn —and the end of the merciless
strife!
My cheeks and my lashes with tears are wet! . . .
Ah, crush me with kisses, Pierrette! Pierrette!
How unutterabiv sweet that sounds! And yet it is
only the plain old gag tricked out with a few sobs,
I kisses and tears. . . .A.S. (Q.) : Unpayable stuff....
Learner: Humorous in its way, but it doesn’t tickle
us hard enough. . . .Spuds: Honorable mention. The
idea is promising, but you have handled it roughly.
... ,L. Imogen: No. . . .Minnie L.: Unsuitable....
Row: Very uneven... .A.T.L.: You rhyme easily,
but there are frequent crudities in your work. You
should do better with practice... .W.W. (Sydney):
It cannot blossom here. ... P. Lonesome: Sorry too
long. .. . Warrandulla : Fairly rough product
Armis: A neat half-dozen lines: —
By each ship that sailed
Thin letters were mailed,
He worked himself thin as a ghost.
They found him dead
His" tombstone read
“Died at his post.”
You insinuate, of course, that he perished in the
post office?. .. .A.L. (Sydney): Rejected with three
cheers. Long live the King! God save His Manu-
script !... .H.K.: Yerse received and suppressed. It
is the sort of thing some politicians commit in
their youth, and suffer from in their old atfe. Never in
your youth apply hot and rebellious nocent water-
spouts to your reputation. .. .I.G. (V.): But the
flock frequently turn on the shepherd and backbite
him. Yarded in the basket.... Elcy (Tas.) : Un-
suitable. .. .M.E.P.: Most despairful poem this week.
After reading it, we burnt blue lights, ordered the
sideboard to be provisioned, made our wills, filed
our schedules and rang up the undertaker and florist.
....Monaco: Edison’s inventions include the quad-
ruplex and sextuplex telegraphic system, the carbon
telephone transmitter, the megaphone and a few
other trifles besides the phonograph. On the whole,
this paper wouldn’t aim anything hard at the man
who described Edison as “clever.”....C. M. Hansen:
Thanks; but the swindle lias already had the Wild
Cat’s attention Cyril Peston: No, he isn’t a
suburban bushman ; so you’re probably talking about
two different stinging vegetables.
The eldest son of the lady who is usually
identified with Margaret Catchpole was given
a grant from Governor Macquarie in Tas-
mania, and settled on it, and a grandson of
the lady still lives on the property at the
advanced age of 90 years. In his prime, he
had some distinction in politics, on the turf
and in out-door sports. One of his horses
once ran second for the Melbourne Cup.
Though all his life he has been connected
with racing, it is said he has never made a
wager.
“Brass Button”: Still another captain,
whose ship was recently lost, has declined
with thanks the offer of another ship from
the same co., and has decided that it’s time
he devoted himself to the serious job of
growing potatoes or running a hen farm.
Landsmen may often have noticed how
many captains go down with their ships,
and seamen will tell you (if they know you
well enough) of captains who have deliber-
ately done the Casabianca act when they
might easily have swum clear. They will
tell you, too, of as good seamen as ever trod
a deck and held a master’s ticket who could
never get better than mate again after their
ship had tripped over a rock or rubbed noses
with another ship. The explanation is
simple. Lloyd’s keep a record of captains.
If anything happens to a ship a note is
made against her captain’s name —just a
bare note without mention of any extenuat-
ing circs, or act-of-God remarks. When a
ship comes up for insurance her captain’s
name is looked up. If any unpleasant hap-
penings are ticked off to him, the rates on
that ship are liable to go up ; and most ship-
owners have a prejudice against employing
captains who are going to cost them heavier
insurance rates. It’s a cold-blooded busi-
ness, but it explains why so many captains
go down with the ship rather than go down
without it.

The Inky Way.
Sydney Daily Telegraph advertises for an over-
seer for its mechanical department; salary, £450.
This reminds The Bulletin that the D.T. —the most
ferociously anti-Melbourne of journals, whose editor
eats a Victorian devilled on toast every morning be-
fore breakfast, in order to get proper color for his
leaders —was started by Melbourne men and capital
(what little they had), and is to a large extent
run by Melbourne men. Instead of adding to its
advertisement, “No men from Melbourne need ap-
ply ! ” King-street has generally gone to Melbourne
for its mechanical bosses. Frecker, Christian, Bowen,
E. W. O’Sullivan, Jack Jones —the succession of over-
seers—were all Melbourneites. .Evidently this pan-
dering to the cabbage-tree mob idea in Sydney pays.
It must, or the Melbourne men on the D.T. wouldn t
put their own pot on. # #
“Wodonga” : Joseph Russell Crone, who died at
Glebe (Svdney) lately, had been off the Inky Way
for some time; but he kept in touch with the craft.
He was the most versatile penman I ever met. The
son of a noted Methody minister in England, he him-
self chucked the pulpit to shake a freer leg in jour-
nalism. I don’t know how he could preach, but he
was a most eloquent lecturer; besides, he was a fine
singer, was chosen to play Roberts when the Cham-
pion billiardist visited the Ovens, captained the team
of cricketers that played against Grace’s Eleven,- and
was organist at any old church that wanted a lift.
And he was as fearless a man as was ever in a coun-
try newspaper office. The boss used to put copy
on the file in Crone’s absence. When Crone returned
the copy was overhauled, and as often as not ripped
up under the boss’s eyes. In later years he was
night sub-editor on jthe Sydney D.T. #
Guy Innes, who succeeds the late Jack Nish ,as
news editor of Melbourne Herald, has had a flashing
journalistic run. Less than 10 years ago he was
assistant to A. Holts:, secretary to the Argus general
manager. He was then principally engaged in taking
shorthand notes for various Departmental heads.
This brought him under the eye of E. S. Cunning-
ham, chief of the reporting staff at that time, who
collared him, and he was soon in charge of the State
Parliamentary staff. After a spell as assistant sub-
editor, Innes, while still under 30, jumped into
Nish’s place as chief sub. Though he had been
looked on as the “white-haired boy” of the office,
and was thought to have the Argus editor’s pen in
his portmanteau, he didn’t hesitate long over the
Herald’s offer of higher screw and day work.
PAPER TEETH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
False teeth made of paper, in Germany, are said
to retain their color as well as porcelain ones,- and
to be stronger and cheaper.— News item.
Dash-Boyang was an editor who owned a “Liberal”
sheet,
A fussy, little yappy thing that yelped in some back
street;
! It had no soul to sell for ads.—’twas hardly ever
bought—
But still to Liberalism it “extended its support” ;
For Claude Dash-Boyang hated well the common
working-class.
“Blokes” mocked his tall and shiny hat, and said
he was an ass ;
His great ambition was to know the suburb’s
“smartest set”—
Of course, for that you must not bow to common
men who sweat.
(Please note that Liberals “perspire” ; ’tis Laborites
who “sweat.”)
But somehow all the local peers went blind, when he
drew near;
Their consorts, when his name came up, screamed
faintly “Oh, my deahl
That dreadful man! I think he writes that papah
over theah!
That silly little rag, you know 1 His waife can’t do
her hair!
I met him at a meeting of the League two years ago;
Of course I’m always civil—it’s good policy, you
k-now;
He’s useful at elections when we want the women’s
votes —
We drive him round and let him ram waild state-
ments down their throats.
(He talks most fri’ful nonsense, but he rams it
down their throats.)”
Dash-Boyang worked and worried in his small and
futile way,
To burst the Labor bounders without either praise
or pay;
The yelping of his paper in the back suburban street
Brought neither ads. nor readers —’twas a most
pathetic sheet.
The hobbled dames he worked for never asked his
wife to tea;
She lived as far from Iceland as from High Sas-
siety;
Still for the “Lib’ral” party poor Dash-Boyang
fiercely fought,
Until he brought up standing in the dark Insolvent
Court.
(His organ shrill had busted—hence the dark Insol-
vent Court.)
A man of law, surmounted by a pile of horsehair
grey,
Said, “How do you explain this?” Then Dash-
Boyang blazed away:
“I’ve fought the ‘Lib’rals’ battle and I’ve drawn the
Tiger’s fangs,
But gained no thanks or credit from these snobbish
‘Lib’ral’ gangs.
The Socialistic Tiger but for me would now be
loose” —
The Registrar said sharply: “Stop! That sort of
talk’s no use!”
His little eyes like embers glowed. His clerkling
grinned beneath.
“We want a few particulars re your financial teeth !”
(A paper minion headed it: “His Own Financial
Teeth.”)
It made a good half-column, but it broke Dash-
Boyang’s heart;
He tottered from that awful place too much unnerved
to start
Once more upon the Tiger and his deeply-rooted
tusks;
That way lay ruination, flanked with cups of tea and
husks.
The sally of the Registrar kept ringing in his brain ;
He thought and spoke of naught but teeth until,
beneath the strain,
His mind gave way. He did a graceful dance upon
the tiles,
Then called a cab and hurried off with all his pre-
cious flies.
(Most editors when crazy cling like burglars to their
flies.)
The months went by (a process this that Man can
never stay) ;
Dash-Boyang once again was seen upon the Inky
Way;
He had a suit-case in each fist; he wore an eager
air,
And asked if anyone has seen “the Tiger” any-
where.
“I’ve got a bag of teeth,” he said ; “enough to fill a
shark!
They said my paper had no bite to back its little
bark 1
Well, now it’s nothing else but bite! Here! open
this and seel
Then whistle up that Tiger and just keep your eyes
on me!”
(They rapidly encabbed him for a madhouse by the
sea.)

KODAK NX FILM.
Every user of a film camera should use only the famous Kodak N.G.
Film—the most reliable and satisfactory ever produced.
It is orthochromatic, and gives clear details in the high lights, with
perfpct transparency in the shadows.
It is daylight loading, unloading and developing; never curls; no hala-
tion, and can be had in all sizes.
Look to it, if you hand over your Kodak for loading in a strange store,
that no inferior substitute film is inserted. The quality of your pictures is
at stake. Experiment with no experiments.
LooK for “ KodaK M on the Spool-end,
and “N.C.” on the box.
HE KODAK CAMERA is so simple as to be readily
understood and operated by the beginner; so efficient that
he does not outgrow it. There is no guesswork with it—
it is all easier than you think. The whole of the operations can
be carried out in complete daylight, and Kodak Photography as
a pastime is quite inexpensive.
Every Kodak picture is natural and true to life. Each has
an intimate individuality, because each is marked by that per-
sonal touch which only you can give it.
Get a Kodak Camera and enjoy the delights of Kodak
Photography from now on. There are Brownie-Kodaks from
5/-; regular Kodak Cameras from 26/=. Kodak Catalogue sud-

most importance that, if he is alive, he should with-
out delay communicate with his brother. Should
any person see this notice, and can give any infor-

“L. Lonesome”: Tlease kill “C.R.W.” (P».
3/8/’ll) before he does any damage.
He suggests running ostriches on the prickly -
pear infested country in Queensland. Seeing
that the spread of the pest is very largely
due to the emu, the introduction of the
ostrich would be a good deal like inoculat-
ing a man with plague to cure him of two
broken legs.
The Irish bull is still good for a roar or
two. Hazelton, M.P., the Irish envoy
(whose wonderful socks and “Vandorian’s”
Bulletin paragraph about them gave Car-
dinal Moran about the last laugh of his
life), was the animal’s showman this time.
At his first meeting in Brisbane, talking of
the Veto Bill, he wound up a fine burst by
remarking that happily the arms of the
House of Lords were now tied hand and
foot.
The sugar dispute has resulted in the
spoils of victory for both parties. The
workers have got their 30s. a week, and an
eight-hour day in the mills. The C.S.R. is
getting £2 per ton extra for its sugar. The
only sufferer is the Australian public, which
is paying at the rate of over half a million
a year extra for its sugar. And it almost
deserves to do it, for having been such a
fool as to vote “No” on the question of the
Commonwealth control of monopolies.
“N.,” about a little devil: —
Professor Ross, of Liverpool, has almost destroyed
the mosquitoes in Port Said, where they were a ter-
rible nuisance—-and Queensland ought at once to be
all ears. So thoroughly has the reform been accom-
plished that people there have given up sleeping
under mosquito curtains. These mosquitoes are not
the anopheles, or malaria-carriers, but the familiar
sort that we have in Australia. The anopheles had
been destroyed in the great yellow fever centres of
Havana and Panama, and Yellow Jack went. Ross
simply applied the same physic to the Port Said
dague, pouring petroleum on the stagnant water.
The painstaking work involved a visit to every
house in Port Said. The ignorant natives resisted
at first, but most of them soon learned to co-operate.
The cost in the first and second years of treatment
was only a little over £2OOO altogether, and £BOO
for the third and last year. And this latter expendi-
ture will be necessary every year. The mosquito lays
about 300 eggs each time, so a little mosquito goes
a long way. And yet not very far in another sense,
for they only travel a few yards from home —the
males in particular.
On the Pillow.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ihe nation slept on the Treaty and woke a dupe.
—Chevalier D’Eon.
The Jap has been signing his Nipponese name,
And swearing that fighting is none of his game;
He’s promised to keep for a decade so low
That none would suspect he was ever a foe ;
And we sing willow, tit willow!
We sigh with relief
At a respite so brief,
And put down our heads on the pillow!
We’d just made a start with our drum and our drill,
And the marching and wheeling made some of us ill ;
■ We wrote to the papers as “Mother of Ten,”
And wailed that our boys should be turned into
men ;
But now —-sing willow, tit willow !
Our troubles are o’er,
And we’re ready to snore
In peace and content on the pillow!
We never had much of a taste for the gun
And war, if it threatened— why couldn’t we runt
if Togo or Nogi should visit our coast,
They couldn’t do much to a runaway host;
But now —sing hooray for the willow !
It’s football and cricket,
And hey! for the wicket,
And then for a.snooze on the pillow!;
With blood and with iron old Bismarck would say
He’d.build up a folk that would front any fray;
But we — we are hoping with paper and pen
To bind the wild beasts on the bosoms of men,
To spread a sweet peace on the billow,
To send off the Jap
In a Rip Winkle nap,
Without any dreams on his pillow.
Of course when the Asian is ready to smite,
He’ll give a year’s warning in fashion polite!
But somewhere I’ve read of a land “in the soup,”
"It slept on a Treaty and tooke as a dupe l”
But now —sing willow, tit willow !
Forebodings are dead,
And we creep off to bed,
And snuggle our heads on the pillow!
The Land of Go Easy is close to our coast,
Its people they cling like’ a wreath to a pqst;
Some day ’twill be whispered (in pity, I ween),
“'Twas the Land of the Loan and the Land of the
Lean!”
But leaning—O willow, tit willow!
It comes to an end
With the people who spend
A decade asleep on the pillow.
QU KENSLAND.
RIP VAN WINK.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, August 19, 1911.
My Dear Thargomindaii,—
Our country cousins and “paying guests”
have floated back to their home anchorages,
buoyed up with new gowns and a feeling of
satisfaction that they had made the very
most of. their Carnival opportunities. The
grand finale occurred on Friday evening,
when Mrs. Arthur Feez and Mrs. William
Collins entertained vice-regality and a couple
of hundred friends at what the enthusiasts
describe as “the best ball of the season, my
dear, and the supper” ! There the nar-
rator gasps. Mere words fail. The dance-
floor was a polished clearing in a forest of
palms. Mrs. Collins wore white, in addi-
tion to her best diamonds; her co-hostess
donned black ninon; and Lady Bosanquet’s
diamonds blazed on white satin.
Before heading for your State, the Bosan-
quet couple ran out to Ascot on Saturday
with the Macgregor clan. Lady B. finished
up a heavy week’s programme without show-
ing a sign of fag. Don’t know how she felt
when she blew the candle out o’ nights, but
I know how I'd have felt —something like
the Macgregor cliiel, who caved-in and nailed
himself to his bunk for the week-end.
A CLEAR CONSCIENCE.
MR. COLD TEA: “Your vile trade is especially denounced in this Booh: ‘He that giveth
his neighbor strong drink ’”
MR. HOT STUFF: “ Look here, ole feller , I never gave anyone a drink in vie life.”
The Irish envoys are the really important
figures now. Redmond is a replica, on a
large scale, of William Redmond, and is
rather apt to talk “Uncle Willie.” A burly,
big-hearted Irishman, “the Cause” seems to
color his whole existence. Hazleton is dis-
tinguished* as the dandy of the party, and
Donovan as the only one who stirs his ora-
tory with a brogue. Anyhow, the combina-
tion has induced all of us —or, rather,, the
best of us—to give our Home Rule principles
a dust-up, and as many of us as possible
are doing it with spare bank-notes or negoti-
able cheques.
One of the prettiest of the new fluffers is
Jean Mort, a daughter of the Franklyn Vale
House of Mort, in whose honor Miss Edie
Davidson, a warbler of note, a few days ago
gathered in several of the Very Best in Girl-
dom. Later, Mamma Mort, before retiring
to Franklyn Vale, tea’d the same company,
plus their parents and friends. Daughter
Mort will remain behind with the Wilton
Loves. Another hostess during the week was
Mrs. Fox, of Dugandan station. She is an
Englishwoman with a “truly” complexion
and exquisite furs.
On Saturday last Mr. J. D. Henry, a
brother of Mrs. A. A. Doyle, one of our most
admired matrons, persuaded Miss Mabel Sin-
clair to chance the future on her ring finger.
She took the risk in white silk and orange
blossoms, and the only note of disappoint-
ment in the good wishes of the party, of
friends who subsequently gathered at Fairy-
knowe, the Sinclair homestead, was that the
popular lady will now live so far away—a
little matter of six days from Cloncurry.
An engagement of interest to Most of Us
concerns brown-eyed Phyllis Austen, whose
mother belongs to the Douglas clan, and a
Mr. Macartney, of your parts. Next month,
too, Bertha Morrison, of the Titian hair and
contralto voice, will make the usual promises
to Mr. Geary. And still the tally is not
complete until the coming nuptials of pretty
Maude Alexander and a gentleman named
Dixon have, been added.
I intended to write you an appreciation of
the Culchaw in our midst, my dear, but per-
haps you will understand it better if I re-
late a little incident which happened when
one of the Most Scholarly gathered her
friends and treated them to a Shakspearian
lecture. Said one charmer to her neighbor,
“Poetry is so delightful. Who is your fav-
orite poet?”- “I think I like Matthew’ Ar-
nold best,” replied the questioned one. “Ah,
yes,” cooed the first; “I do so love ‘The
Light of Asia’!”
At 59 Prince’s Square, London, are
gathered together quite a small colony of
Australians, among them being Mrs. Dal-
ryrnple, Miss Baird, Mrs. Ross (of War-
wick) and her two daughters, Mr. Waldron
Taylor (a son of Dr. Taylor), Mr. Andrew
Black (Brisbane’s coal king), and Mrs.
Walker (of Tenterfield) and her daughters.
Mrs. Lockhart Spence was also a member of
the colony till quite recenly, but has fled to
the Land of Not Too Many Cakes, while
Mrs. Bocock, a one-time literary light in this
city, has gone to Ireland, to renew her ac-
quaintance with various units of kinship.
The Andrew Menzies, whose resting-place
in London was also 59 Prince’s Square, at
latest information had started on a six-
weeks’ tour round the Continent. Before
leaving England they motored a party of
friends to Henley for the regatta.
Mr. and Mrs. J. A. Robertson propose to
return to Queensland from Britain some time
in August, but daughter will remain for an-
other six months, and will visit Switzerland
for the winter sports.
. The unanimous vote is that the team of
girl tennis athletes from your State can
not only play the game well, but give us
points in the manner of dressing for it.
Mesdames Ford and Sheldon, with their neat
short skirts and short-sleeved blouses, looked
specially business-like and smart when on
the courts.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
At _ a cattle-throwing and tying competi-
tion in Brisbane the other day, Australian
Tom Lawton, using the Australian tail-
twisting method of throwing, got his bullock
down and tied him up in 59isec., while
“Broncho George” Looper, who used the
American method (lassoing), took Lnin.
37sec. over the job.
Died at Maryborough on August 16, G.
H. Burn, who was in the Customs service in
Bananaland 35 years, and was Sub-Collector
at Maryborough at the time of his retire-
ment two years ago. He was also returning
officer for Wide Bay, and had in that capa-
city got into the habit of declaring Prime
Minister Fisher duly elected.
Mahrigong homestead, outside Winton,
wanted a drop more water to wet itself
with. So it got to work, put a bore down
205 ft., struck water, and had a windmill up
and the moisture flowing, all inside eight
days. If it wasn’t for its pests and its re-
cords, Queensland would spend many more
lonely, silent nights than it does.
Premier Denham informed his People's
Progressive League recently that the chief
object of that association was “to maintain
the liberty of the individual, and to secure
his freedom from coercion whether applied
hy organised Capital or organised Labor.”
So, ot course, the Butterman’s League will
at once start talking earnestly to the meat
tiust, the sugar monopoly, the shipping
ring, and the timber combine!
Adamson, M.L.A., considers that the sec-
tion of' the Health Amendment Act requir-
ing chemists to state the formula! of their
proprietary medicines on the bottle or
packet “a grave injustice to a body of
highly cultured professional men.” Chemists
aren’t “professional men” any more than
cooks, nor are they of necessity more cul-
tured than navvies. But, even if they were,
why should they not be compelled to describe
correctly the articles which they sell, the
same as other shopkeepers?
Life is a strenuous business in Thatgo-
mindah. The other day the bridegroom neg-
lected to turn up at the wedding. The missing
swain was thereupon interviewed by the
father and brother of the bride—in 'vain.
Then the bride’s mamma took a hand. Or.
more correctly, she took a table-knife, and.
chased her intended son-in-law, until that
persecuted bachelor ran to the police for'
protection, followed by the injured damosel!
and her indignant relatives. Thargomindah>
evidently understands the “unwritten law"'
to mean the right of ill-treated ladies to pur-
sue the culprit with a carving-knife.

Kaiser and Cadets.
Berlin, 22nd November, 1910.
The Kaiser in addressing the Cadets urged them to become abstainers.
He said that the victory in the next war would go to the nation that had
the least consumption of alcohol.
The greatest substitute for alcoholic drink ever produced is the beverage
O.T. It has the "bite” and stimulating qualities of alcohol without any
intoxicating effect, and has the virtue when blended with Spirits of reducing
the effects of the alcohol. O.T. is the most suitable drink in the world for
abstainers, and for those who wish to be moderate.

Specially approved
and recommended
as a pure product
by the British

A body formed to protect the
food supplies of the public of
the United Kingdom.
O.T. is quite unlike any other beverage—
it stands alone. It has a delightful flavor
of its own, and has as well that satisfying
“bite ” which is one of the most attractive
qualities of Spirits.
Compared with other non-alcoholic drinks
O.T. is well endowed with qualities which
they lack-CHARACTER, DISTINCTION
and BENEFICIAL EFFECTS.

O.T. meets the requirements of those
adverse to taking Spirits, and of those
often called on to take a “Social Glass”
who wish to avoid the effects of too much
Alcoholics or too much gassy drink. It
appeals to all ages, conditions and classes
of men, women and children In all seasons,
In all climates, in all countries.
SEE THAT YOU GET THIS BOTTLE.
CONSIDER THE BENEFITS YOU
OBTAIN FROM O.T.
is derived from Fruits and Herbs, recognised for their nutritive
• • and beneficial properties, and having essentials favorable for the
blending of a delicious, healthful drink. Agreeable to the palate
and distinguished for its favorable effects on the constitution, O.T. is an everyday
beverage that can be taken at all times with happy results—it is always a safe and
desirable form of refreshment for use at Home, at the Club, at the Bar.
Having the same warming, exhilarating and cheering effects as spirituous
liquors, but being without any intoxicating quality, O.T. is the happy medium
between a soft and a hard drink, and the nearest approach to a substitute for
alcohol that has ever been produced. Full-bodied, new, and distinctive in charac-
ter, charming in flavor, not too sweet, not gassy, its taste grows on you, and after
the first bottle you just begin to fully appreciate its deliciousness.
Added to water (hot or cold), Lemonade, Ginger Ale or Soda Water,
O.T. improves the flavor and forms a blend more grateful and more power-
ful in allaying thirst. A dash of O.T. improves the flavor of Whisky,
Schnapps, Gin or Wine in a remarkable manner, lessens their intoxicating
effect, and leaves its own sweet aroma on the breath.
In Country districts, where the cost of Aerated Waters is too expensive, O.T.
and water (hot or cold) will be appreciated both for its deliciousness and economi-
cal cost.
In all seasons O.T. has excellent qualities to recommend it, but for the IV inter
it is specially suitable, as it is the only non-alcoholic drink capable of promoting
warmth. Its stimulating effect on a cold day improves the circulation and pro-
motes the warmth in the body necessary to ward off Colds and Chills. Taken in
time, it will counteract the effects of a Chill and drive out a Cold that may be
coming on you. It is invaluable to athletes, outdoor workers, and to those working,
travelling or driving at night.
O.T. has excellent properties as a stomachic, and is of the greatest service in
promoting appetite, helping digestion and assimilation, and enabling you to obtain
the greatest benefit from the food you eat. Drink in some form is indispensable to
the solution and digestion of food, and, because of its beneficial influence, O.T. is
without doubt one of the best Meal-time drinks. No beverage sits so agreeably on
the stomach, so refreshes the system, or forms a more grateful repast. As a liqueur
after meals O.T. is more efficacious and has more value as a digestive than many
so-called liqueurs, and, not containing alcohol, its use is specially recommended to
ladies.
O.T. has a soothing and tonic effect, and if you wake up unrefreshed
in the morning, with a furred tongue and a bad taste in the mouth, a glass
of O.T. will clear the digestion, correct the liver, and make you fit and
well again. If you suffer from Indigestion arising from erorrs in diet,
Fulness after meals, Flatulency or Colic, you have an excellent remedy
in O.T. On a winter night, to promote a healthy glow and ensure a good
night’s rest, a glass of O.T. hot is the best of nightcaps.
O.T. is now sold in the following Countries: —
Australia, New Guinea and Pacific Islands, Dutch East Indies, Straits Settlements,
Ceylon, India, China, Japan, Manila, South Africa, \test and East Africa, Eng-
land, Ireland, Scotland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Newfoundland,
Canada, West Indies.
BEWARE OF FRAUDULENT PASSING OFF
Refuse inferior drinks put up by unscrupulous manufacturers in
their endeavor to imitate 0.T., as these imitations do not contain the
same ingredients and have not the virtues and merits of O.T.
Insist on Getting the Genuine.
Traders who pass off other drinks as O.T. will be proceeded
against under the Commonwealth Trade Marks Act.
if unable to get Genuine O. T, in your locality
please send us the name of your trader.
BUY A BOTTLE AND TRY IT.
As with everything else, the practical test
of O.T. is the one to go by. You can obtain a
bottle at your grocer’s at a small cost, and if
you put it to the test you will find O.T. will
prove to be the most delicious and most bene-
ficial drink you have ever known.

SUBDIVIDED INTO FARMS
From 100 to 600 Acres.
Liberal Terms of 10 Years.
Long Frontage to the Emu and Deep Creeks,
Rich Flats and Undulating Rises.
WS. KEAST and Messrs. P. LEARMONTH and
Co. (in conjunction) have received instruc-
• tions from the owners to SELL PRI-
VATELY,
THAT MAGNIFICENT PROPERTY,
Being the first subdivision of the Bolinda Vale
Estate, consisting of 15,000 acres of rich agri-
cultural and grazing land, which has been
held by the Clarke family since 1838.
On this portion of the estate much land will be
found equal to a great deal of the Western district
land. Practically all virgin soil and numerous rich
Hats.
This estate is specially adapted for agriculture
and the growing of wheat, oats and barley, hard
to surpass, and much of it suitable for potato-
growing.
Magnificent dairying land, and is excellent coun-
try for sheep and lamb rattening, those from
Bolinda Vale having for many years realised top
prices in the Melbourne markets. It is the home
of the famous shorthorn herd of Sir Rupert Clarke,
which have always taken the principal prizes in
all the Australian shows, and are so -favorably
known throughout the Commonwealth.
This property has an average rainfall of about
24in., and is situated in one of the best agricul-
tural districts in and around Melbourne, and is
ea]table of very great production.
For the past 50 years this property has been
used for the breeding of sheep and cattle.
The situation is about 25 miles from Melbourne,
three miles from Sunbury, and runs up within half-
mile of the Lancefield junction railway station at
the other end, and joins the railway where a siding
is proposed to be constructed.
Liberal terms of 10 years will be given, namely,
10 per cent, cash, an instalment equal to 10 per
cent, of the total amount of the purchase money
in 1,2, 3, and 4 years, and the balance of the pur-
chase money at the end of 10 years.
Auctioneers beg to draw special attention to this
magnificent property, within 25 miles of Melbourne,
and would ask northern buyers who have recently
sold their properties, before inspecting elsewhere, to
allow us to show them this estate; it is the first
time an acre of it has been subdivided and put on
the market.
The situation is one of the best in Australia, with
a climate unsurpassed. Sheep and cattle can be
driven off the property in one day and put in the
market the next morning. The freight from Lance-
field Junction is only 4s. 6d. per ton.
What has taken place in other estates cut up by
Sir Rupert Clarke is bound to take place in this
estate, and there is sure to be a big increase in
value.
Its nearness to Melbourne, its low freights, its
great carrying capacities, its productiveness for
agriculture, and good rainfall, and, possessing as
it does, so many advantages over other estates, we
can with every confidence recommend an early in-
spection.
By giving two days’ notice to the auctioneers,
buyers will he met at either Sunbury or Lancefield
Junction railwav stations, and. driven over the pro-
pertv free of charge.
The vendor has agreed to allow any outside agent
introducing an approved buyer 1 per cent, com-
mission.

preserve that beautifully velvet skin which is one of their chief charms. The difficulty disap-
pears “like snow before the sun” if ladies will only prepare their skin by consistently using
ICILMA FLUOR CREAM,
the world-famed face cream without grease, which brings the beauty that lasts. A little
rubbed on the skin daily, especially before going out, prevents the ravages of the Australian
Climate, leaves no trace on the skin, and never grows hair.

Hunting Rifies
After them with a good re-
peating rifle ! Be sure it’s
a Winchester, though, as
this rifle is reliable and
accurate. It is made in
calibers suitable for hunting
any size of game. The
Model 1892, made in .25-20, .32, .38 and .44 cal-
ibers, is widely used for Australian game. These
rifles are not expensive, although they are made to
get game and stand hard usage. The Winchester
.22 caliber Automatic and Winchester Model 1905
Self-Loading rifles, made in .32 and .35 calibers, are
also very popular among Australian hunters, as they
never fail. These rifles are very rapid in shooting
*v
u
and unequalled as game
getters, being particularly
effective on running game,
as they can be held right on
the game while a succes-
sion of rapid shots is fired
with accuracy. Their system
of operation is simple and
they please in every way.

THROW AWAY YOUR PIPE
■ and
SMOKE MY CIGARS
I'VE knocked around a bit over Australasia in
my time —been in the back parts of pretty
well every State and New Zealand.
I’ve mixed with shearers and musterers and
rouseabouts at different sheds; been at cattle
camps in Queensland; up among the snow
country of Monaro- in the jarrah forests of
Westralia; in mining camps all over the Com-
monwealth; and everywhere Ive seen the boys
smoking their pipes—and seldom a sign of a
Cigar,
Then, I’ve pulled out my case and handed
some DIADEMAS around. And after all this,
people say to me—“ Oh, Australians won’t smoke
Cigars!”
gdfg
I do just get riled when I
hear this, J tell you that
nearly every p : pe-smolter,
once he gets the taste of my
DIADEMAS Cigars, swears
by them. They knock pipe-
smoking hollow!
There’s nothing but To-
bacco in them —and the best
Cigar Tobacco that is grown
-—the wrapper, finest Java
leaf; and the inside filling,
all clean, straight, long Brazil.
They draw easily and burn
freely, for they are hand-
rolled by as good Cigar-
makers as there are any-
where in the world.
The boys out-back I’ve
given them to, as I said, just
swear by my Cigars, Men
in the Cigar trade here, too
■ —men with whom Cigar-
smoking is a life habit—come
to me and say—“ Look here,
those Cigars of yours are
better than any we can get
in the city. Let us have a
box as a favor."
Now, I want you to try
my Cigars —at my ex-
pense.
I want to convert you from
the pipe to Cigars-—to my
Cigars. All I wantisfor you
to buy my Cigars as against
your pipe and favorite to-
bacco —and I know you’ll be
a regular customer of mine.
I’ll post a box of 100 DIADEMAS right to
your address for 22/6. Smoke 5 6°f them,
and if they’re not as good as the best 6d. Cigar
you can buy send the rest of the Cigars back,
and I’ll return every penny of your money. I'll
make no deduction for the Cigars you’ve smoked
There’s no funny business about this offer,
mind. I’ll keep to every word of it, and there 11
be no “back answers ” if you want your money
back. If you want to know the kind of man
you’re dealing with, write to the General
Manager, the Commercial Bank, Melbourne,
and he’ll tell you I’m a clean, straight chap in all
my dealings.
Send 22/6 to-day, and get the box of 100
DIADEMAS by return post. In ordering, say
whether you like the mild, medium, or strong
grade.

OBJECTS.
THIS COMPANY has been Incorporated with the Objects stated in the Memorandum of
Association, and primarily to acquire from “Mamara Option Limited” certain Freehold Lands
and Plantations in the Island of Guadalcanal - , British Solomon Islands—known as the
Mamara Plantations—and to carry on and further develop the same.
PURCHASE PRICE.
The price to be paid for the property is £lOO,OOO, which will be paid and satisfied as
follows:—As to £40,000 by the allotment of 40,000 fully paid-up shares of this Company to
“Mamara Option Limited” or its nominees, and as to the balance by the payment of £15,000
in cash on Ist October, 1911, and £45,000 on 7th June, 1921, the latter sum with interest
thereon at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum being secured by a mortgage over the property.
The Company takes over the property from Ist June, 1911, but interest on the mortgage
does not begin to run until Ist October, 1911. The Company also pays the Vendors for their
stock in trade of the store at landed cost as on the Ist June, 1911.
All the Directors and the Promoters of this Company are shareholders in the Vendor
Company, which receives 20,000 of the above mentioned fully paid-up shares, and £lOOO in
cash, the balance of the purchase price being received by Captain Oscar Svensen and Joseph
Theodore d’Oliveyra as part of the consideration for the sale of their properties to the
Vendor Company. BRIEF PARTICULARS OF. MAMARA.
The property has been reported on by Mr. H. N. Leach, Agricultural Editor of the
“Queenslander,” and Brisbane “Courier,” an acknowledged authority on Island matters.
The following is a brief resume of his report:—
1. SITUATION—At the N.W. end of the Island of Guadalcanar, British Solomon
Islands, adjoining Lever Bros.’ largest plantations.
2. COMMUNICATION—By steamer with Sydney and Brisbane every six weeks.
3. TlTLE—Freehold.
4. RATES AND TAXES—NONE.
5. AREA—Approximately 5000 acres, having about 6 miles of sea frontage.
6. SOIL —First class for Cocoanuts and Cotton, also some excellent Rubber land.
7. RAlNFALL—Averages about 102 inches per annum, well distributed throughout the
year, and more than sufficient for all requirements.
8. HURRlCANES—Hurricanes, Cyclones and Typhoons are unknown in the Solomons,
which gives them a very great advantage over Fiji and the New Hebrides.
0. CULTIVATION.—Rubber: 15 acres, planted 1910. Cotton: 109 acres, in full bearing.
Cocoanuts: 42 acres, planted 1905; 200 acres, planted 1906-7; 300 acres, planted
1908; 313 acres, planted 1909-10; 145 acres, planted 1911.
N.B. —The Plantation Plans show about 1010 acres of cocoanuts, but Mr. Leach’s
estimate of 1000 acres has been accepted for the sake of being on the safe side.
10. POSSIBILITIES—At least 2000 acres of first-class cocoanut land and 1000 acres of
rubber land remain to be planted. The cotton area can also be increased to at
least 1000 acres.
1L PLANTATIONS—The plantations have been laid out and worked on the most
scientific lines, and are unusually clear of weeds and plant pests.
12. DRAlNAGE—Particular attention has been paid to drainage, over 4 miles of drains
having been cut through the property,
13. PLANTING—The Cocoanuts have all been grown from carefully selected seed nuts
and have been planted 27 feet apart, or 52 to the acre.
14. COCOANUTS —42 acres planted in 1905 are now in bearing, and the balance of the
3000 acres will come into bearing gradually during the next 6 years, and by the
year 1917 the entire 1000 acres will be in bearing.
15. COTTON—About 109 acres are under cotton, 64 acres of which is a special hybrid
perpetual, developed on the property by Mr. d’Oliveyra, and known as “Mamara,”
which sells readily at from 1/- to 1/4 per lb., and the seed at 10/- per lb.
16. RUBBER—A small area only is under rubber, but sufficient to prove that it
flourishes on the higher ground, which, being unsuitable for cocoanuts, can thus
be turned to account.
17. SAWMILL—The only sawmill in the Solomons is on Mamara, and the local demand
for timber is more than sufficient to absorb the entire output.
18. TIMBER —There is on the sea front a quantity of Yandilla, an ornamental timber
of tfrecedai - class, worth at least 30/- per 100 super, feet in Sydney, and costing
about 12/- to 15/- per 100 super, feet landed there. This timber is also in great
request locally at 20/- per 100 super, feet at the mill, at which price it shows a
very good profit.
19. STORE—The Store not only supplies Mamara itself, but also the surrounding
plantations, and a profit of over £lOOO accrued from this source last year,
which amount is capable of considerable increase.
20. BUILDINGS—AII necessary buildings are already in existence, but the Overseers’
bungalows require some slight expenditure to make them thoroughly suitable;
and the erection of a kiln for drying copra is recommended. The total cost of
this will not exceed £250.
21. LABOR—About 100 indentured natives are already at work, and others can be
obtained in the group at a cost of about £7 per head on two to three years’
terms. Wages and allowances amount to about £7 per man per annum.
The Islands being controlled by the BRITISH IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT, there is
no legislation tending to discourage the employment of the colored labor neces-
sary for the development of the property.
22. WHITE SUPERVISION —An agreement has been made with Mr. J. T. d’Oliveyra,
wffio has had charge, of the Plantation since 1905, to pay at least two visits a
year during the next two years, to inspect the work to be carried on under the
supervision of three white overseers, two of whom have been on the property
since 190 S, and are thoroughly familiar with the best methods of working the
plantation. f .
The Company will also have the assistance on the Board of Captain Svenson, probably
the best-known and most-successful planter in the Solomons, whose advice anil
experience will be invaluable.
DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTS and PROSPECTS.
(1) DEVELOPMENT.
While the Company cannot be considered as a development proposition pure and
simple, seeing that without any further development whatever the area already
planted would in seven years’ time return at least £15,000 a year net profit (25
per cent, on the minimum capital, £60,000), the Directors recognise that to secure
the full benefit of the purchase they wall require to expend a large amount of
capital during the next few years in developing and extending the plantation.
They propose to plant from 250 to 300 acres of Cocoanuts a year until at least an
additional 1500 (one thousand five hundred) acres have been planted, and about
1000 acres of Rubber by sections of from 250 to 300 acres a year, as additional
labor becomes available.
While the Cocoanuts are maturing, Cotton will be grown as a catch crop between
the young trees.
The cost of planting cotton is not more than 5/- per acre, and at least twice this amount
will be saved in the reduced cost of weeding and keeping the plantation clean during the four
years or so which elapse before the cocoanut trees are sufficiently advanced to render the
growing of a catch crop unnecessary, and in the meantime large profits will be received
from the cotton crop, which is ready for picking at about nine months from date of planting,
and in the case of the “Mamara” variety gives a profitable return for four years.
The plant of the sawmill will also be extended immediately) with the object of increasing
the output to 3000 feet per day, at which rate there is at least two years’ work in hand.
(2) PRODUCTS.
(A) COCOANUTS AND COPRA —The yield of Cocoanuts and Copra in the Solomons is
mugh greater than in Ceylon and Fiji.
Mr. Leach reports that Government Returns inspected by him show that eight-year-
old trees on the Government Plantation on Shortland Island PLANTED 35
TREES TO THE ACRE ONLY, are returning 24cwt. of copra per annum, and
young (six-year-old) trees at the Rua Sura Mission are returning 13cvvt. of copra
per annum.
Mr. Leach anticipates at least an equally good return per tree from the Mamara
plantation, which, as previously stated, is PLANTED 52 TREES TO THE
ACRE, but in making up the Estimates contained in this Prospectus the yield
has been estimated as under:—
6- old trees, lOcwt. per acre.
7- trees, 15cwt. per acre.
8- trees, 20cwt. per acre.
The price of copra varies somewhat, but the general tendency is upwards owing t
increased use of late years in the manufacture of butter substitutes.
Seven factories have already been started in Germany and two in France for this nurons
and a large one is now being built in Chicago. The industry is a very profitable one and i
sure to spread to other parts of the world, which cannot fail to have the effect of advanein
the price of copra.
The price of copra in Sydney on 12th July, 1911, was £2l 10s. per ton, equal to at lenct
£l9 10s. per ton at the Plantations. This leaves a net profit of £l6 10s. after allowing the amn'e
margin of £3 per ton for the cost of manufacture.
In the calculations shown a net profit of £l5 per ton has been assumed.
<B) n C n ?l’lhlir Mam ’ ra cotton-specimens of which may be seen at the offices of the Coin
nf - y s J^ ro^ ers 1S amongst the finest grown, anil has a ready sale at from 1 /- to 1/4 per
‘ b n '“ n h / Land on market. It is proposed to bring the planted area up to 250 acres at
on . c ® J and to plant a further 250 acres a year for the next six years.
Ihe yield of 40 acres of Mamara cotton last year was 6 tons 9cwt. 351 b., which, at 1/- per lb
glVe f. a »ross return of over £lB per acre, exclusive of the value of the seed, which at 10/-
per lb. means a considerable sum in itself.
AHowmg one-third for cost of production and ginning, a net return of £l2 per acre may be
acreonly ° n ’ tlie calcula<aons skown here have been based on a net return of £lO per
(C) RUBBER—Professor Macmillan Brown, who has just returned from a special visit to the
Solomon Islands, is reported (in Sydney “Sun,” 3rd August, 1911) to have said“ The
.Islands will produce rubber of the best quality, the soil being volcanic and very rich.”
übber begins to make a return in the fifth year from date of planting. In the calculations
lere shown a net return of £6 per acre in the sixth year is assumed, increasing to £2O
Rf r , aci i e . la I tae tenth and subsequent years—a most conservative estimate, considering
a iL a tappm 2 9* 4f-year-old trees on the Isabel Plantation of the Solomon Islands
Rubber Plantations Limited, of which Messrs. Svensen and Archibald are also Directors,
recently gave a yield at the rate of over 2501 b. of rubber per acre per annum, which at
yeai ,market Pnce of only 3/6 per lb., means a net profit of over £2O per acre in the fifth
(D) TIMBER—Mr. Minge, the practical sawmiller who originally built the sawmill and
started the timber industry on Mamara, reports that, with the addition of a 20-h.p. engine
oonu y ) '7‘ p ' b ®iler and an extra saw bench, the capacity of the mill can be increased to
3000 feet per day, at which rate he considers there will be at least four years’ full work.
The cost of production is estimated by Mr. Minge about 4/- per super, feet at the mill, and the
selling price locally is 20/- per 100 super, feet, at which price the entire output can
probably be disposed of, leaving 16/- per 100 super, feet profit, Any surplus can be
dlspose(i of m Brisbane or Sydney at a profit of at least 10/- per 100 super, feet.
When the new machinery is installed and the output increased the net profit from timber
aione tor the first three or four years should approximate £5OOO per annum, but for the
purpose of this prospectus has been estimated at £2500 for two years and £lOOO for the
third year. A two years’ contract has been made with Mr. Minge to take charge of the
.... ™^L at a sa ? ar y, of f 5 per week and a royalty of 3d. per 100 super, feet sawn.
(E) STORE—The Store is. a highly profitable undertaking, and the business done is capable
of considerable extension. The profit from this source for the year 1910 exceeded £llOO,
tae ® mpl °y ment °f additional labor should quickly increase to from £l5OO to
± 000 a year. In the calculations included in this prospectus the expected profit has been
taken at £lOOO a year throughout.
(3) EXPENSES OE MANAGEMENT, &c.
Exclusive of the cost of running the plantation on its present lines (which has been
allowed for in estimating the net returns from produce) and of capital expended on develop-
ment and extension, estimated at under £5OOO per annum (which will be charged to capital
account), the expenses of the Company should be to start with about £3OOO per annum, made
up as under:— • ’

Total Profit £202,619
Average 12 years, £16,885 = 21.1 per cent, on £BO,OOO Cai>ital
In each of these years the cost of development, estimated at £5OOO, is charged
against Current Income before calculating net profits.
On these estimates it will be seen that the Company should be able
1. To earn on an average 20 per cent, per annum for the first 12 years on the entire
Capital of £80,00(1.
2. To expend on development work £25,000 out of profits in the same period.
3. To bring the value of the property up to nearly £300,000 on a 10 per cent, basis by
the end of that period.
r 4. To earn over 35 per cent, per annum net thereafter.
The plantation should reach its maximum development in about 20 years’ time, when the
net profits should be approximately as under:—
2500 acres Cocoanuts at £l5 per acre net profit .. . . .. .. £37,500
1000 acres Rubber at £2O per acre net profit .. .. .. 20 000
Less cost of Brisbane Management, say
£57,500
2,500
Net profits £55,000
Equal to 68.75 per cent, on £BO,OOO Capital.
Intending: investors should bear in mind that altliougfli koine what slow in development
with respect to the area not already under cultivation, a plantation well managed is one of
the safest forms of investment.
On this subject the Financial Editor of LONDON “Truth,” writing under date Ist June.
1910, said:—
The prospects of the leading producing Companies are more rosy and established
than any other industrial investments in the world Neither home rails, mining,
land, oil, or any other form of investment can forecast the future on such satisfac-
tory lines as the best rubber estates. Even with rubber at 2/- per lb. the produc-
ing companies will earn profits beyond the dreams of any mining promoter in the
heyday of the Australian and Kaffir booms.”
That this is equally true of Cocoanut plantations is shown by Mr. Bremner’s figures
already quoted.
This property offers a good immediate return on capital invested, with the certainty of
something very much better in the near future.
Seven contracts affecting the Company have been made, which, together with copies of
the Memorandum and Articles of Association, and of the Reports above mentioned, may he

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will
be glad to hear of a simple and scientific de-
vice which will restore your hearing, no mat-
ter how old you we. There is no mystery
or secrecy about it; we describe it fully and
explain just how it acts.
You use spectacles as sight magnifiers, and
in the same way you may use this sound
magnifier as an aid to weak hearing. But,
unlike spectacles, the Wilson Common-sense
Ear-Drums are invisible and comfortable.
You can’t tell you are wearing them. No
one else can, either, because they are not
seen.
They rest the ear nerves by taking the
strain off them—the strain of trying to hear
dim sounds. What a blessed relief to have
done with that tiring strain!
Being made of the purest and softest Para
rubber, they cannot be felt, even when the
head rests on a pillow. For the same reason,
a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. In fact, they protect the ear, the
tender inner parts that are so sensitive, from
cold winds, dust, sudden and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand why
these facts are true, and why the Sound Mag-
nifier restores the hearing, we give an illus-
tration of one as it lies in the ear. You will
notice that the Sound Magnifier is shaped
like a trumpet, and so conveys even the
faintest sounds right to the natural ear-
drum. Being of the softest rubber, it cannot
sdfsd
hurt the ear. It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort. The division
that runs across the mouth is to allow the re-
moval and insertion of the Ear-Drum, and to
brace it.
The shape of the Wilson Ear-Drum has
been chosen after years of experience as the
best adapted to carry the faintest sound right
down to the natural ear-drum.
To persons who are nearly deaf, it is not
only trying to have people shout at them,
but it hurts the ear-drum. When age comes
the ear-drum sometimes gets thickened, or
loses its tightness, and shouting does not act
properly on it. It only makes a confused
and tiring noise. But the Sound Magnifiers
concentrate the sound in the best spot for
perfect hearing.
Of course, if you have lost the hearing-
nerve completely, or were born deaf, we can-
not pretend to cure you. Only a miracle
could do that, in spite of some of the absurd
claims made to-day. But if you can hear the
faintest sound, do not despair. You will
never regret trying the Wilson Ear-Drums.
We have letters to show you from deaf people
in Australia and New Zealand who have been
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may
wear the Ear-Drums day and night, and take
them out whenever you wish. Children can
wear them (we have special sizes for children
from six to twelve). Even a child can insert
and remove them without the least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s
single visit). This includes a pair of Drums
(they are only sold in pairs), a fine nickel
remover and also an inserter. After the first
pair is bought you may purchase a single
drum at any time for Bs., but the pair you
get at first will last quite two years. Do not
ask for a trial pair. We do not send them
out on trial, and so they are never second-
hand. Use the Order Form below, and the
Outfit will be sent to you at once, with the
fullest instructions. Don’t delay, but have
the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

CURED AT 76
Three Years’ Suffering from Complication of Biliousness and Gastritis —
Could Keep Nothing Down —Gave Up All Hope of Recovery.
NOW HALE AND HEARTY AT 85
-THANKS TO BILE BEANS.
MRS. A. FULLERTON, residing in Allen
Street. Woollongabba, South Brisbane,
says“ Some 12 years ago I had a
terrible illness, which afflicted me for three long
years. An excess of bile got into my system, and
I was hardly expected to live. I grew so weak
that I was utterly helpless, ray son having to
help me about; in fact, I was a perfect wreck, and
a shadow of my former self. The symptoms
seemed to point to a complication of biliousness
and gastritis, for I used to retch up everything I
ate or drank, the straining being terrible, and the
pains in my stomach unbearable. I also suffered
agonies from indigestion. The pains in the chest
and back and between the shoulders were dreadful
Housework was out of the question, and I gradually
grew worse and worse, until all hopes were given up for
my recovery. I tried every description of medicine and
so-called remedies in my search for a cure, but I could
not get relief from any of them. They did me absolutely
no good whatever, and my money was simply thrown
away. My son, reading that Bile Beans were a proved
cure for ailments similar to those that I was suffering
from, purchased a box of this splendid medicine and
persuaded me to try them- After the first few doses I

realised that Bile Beans were doing me a lot of good, so I continued taking them, and
began to pick up strength, the biliousness entirely abating, and my stomach being
stronger my appetite greatly improved in consequence. I underwent a good course of Bile
Beans and gave them a fair trial, and I was entirely cured of all my ailments, freed of all
pain, and restored to health. lam 85 years of age, hale and hearty, and never suffer from

Like warriors, hung above the fields
Where Sultan Summer frankly yields
His plenteous boon;
Like nautcli girls dance the naked days
Down avenues of cane and maize,
While on his pipes the North-Wind plays
A careless tune.
From ranges walled, through gates ajar
At Copmanhurst and Yugilbar,
Pours down the Clarence from afar
His noble tide;
And, spreading forth in creek and arm,
Enriches with his waters warm
A fertile land of field and farm
In deltas wide.
And, when this vassal task is done,
With all his winding courses run,
He seeks reward for service won ;
And to his queen,
The shining Sea, whose silver shores
Are musical with rhythmic oars,
At last his singing soul outpours
By Yamba green !
The depths of noon are rarely stirred
By restless foot or roving bird ;
But in the topaz morn are heard —-

Of suitors calling from the green
Recess of gardens Florentine—
The reed birds in their nests unseen

As tuneful heralds of a feast,
When Morning flaunts the conquered East,
With scarlet regiments released
From Night’s duress,
Beyond the lawns, where fall in showers
Of snow the great magnolia flowers,
The magpies from their leafy towers
Their joys express.
By rolling marsh and rainbowed stream
The opal-tinted dewdrops gleam •
And cluster in a rajah’s dream;•
First spoils of Day
From hyacinth and- lily swept,
They pearl the vouches where they slept,
As purple princes who bewept
The Night’s delay.
Oh, Land of drowsy days sublime
Where dwelled my Heart, in rest and rhyme,
Through all a golden summertime!
In dreams again
I see thy sunlit splendors blaze ;
And, walking in a moonlit maze,
I hear the night wind where it plays
Among the cane.

To you again.
Alas, the dramas that have been!
The ravished musk and myrtle green
That crowned a comely country queen
Are dead and sere:
But Mem’ry, folded like a rose
Long pressed between book pages, throws
A fragrance from the Past that shows
Our hearts how dear
Were tho£e enraptured hours agone,
When through the woodlands, on and on,
Sweet Chloris strayed with Corydon
Love’s pathway far;
When by the pen of seeming chance,
Was written in the Book, “Romance,”
A line that flashes like a lance

A, gallant, fed with swift desire,
Uplifted then his crest of fire
And smote upon a burning lyre

To be the bridesmaid of delight

Besought and won.
By silver sea and golden sand
We twain have wandered hand in hand,
W hen all the world was lovers’ land,
My Chloris dear;
Nor shall the years our mem’ries cheat
Of love that triumphed in defeat,
Though long the musk and myrtle sweet
Be dead and sere.

The Earthquake at Carson’s.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE were discussing wire-strainers
when Lignum Bill broke in.
“Y’ can have all yer patent
strainers for me,” he says. “Give me a fork
stick, and I’ll bust any wire that was ever
run through a post. When I was on Car-
son's, down west of Young, I put up a per-
formance with the fork which ain’t never-
been beat.
. Carson believed in big posts and big
wire. A lot of his fencin’ was No. 6; but
when I got the job there the posts was
pretty, old, an he set me ah’ another bloke
puttin in new strainin’ posts on an east-and-
west, line runnin’ off the boundary. We
had em all up when he sent for Jim to go
into the homestead for a few days black-
smithin , an I had to go on strainin’ wire
until he came back.
I started on a Friday—blazin’ hot day,
too an blowed if ever I saw wire stretch
like that did. At every strain I had yards
of slack. I went back to see if any of the
strainers had give; but they were well stayed
an’ couldn’t shift. An’ the blanky wire
didn’t seem to be pullin’ out fine anywhere,
either. So I kep’ on strainin’, an’ the slack
kep’ on cornin’ —yards of it. When I
reached the end of that line I must have cut
off about three chain from each wire—an’
the whole line wasn’t more’n a mile long!
Started on the opposite side of the paddick
nex’ day, an’ the same thing happened.
“On Sunday I was doin’ a bit of washin’
when up drives the boss along with Bill
Smith, who was sinkin’ a prospectin’ shaft
in the nex’ paddick, about 40 chain over
the boundary on Dawson’s selection.
“ ‘Mornin’, Bill,’ sez the boss. ‘Feel any
earthquakes out here?’
“ ‘Earthquakes!’ I sez. ‘Why, has there
been a bust-up somewhere?’
“ ‘There must have been something of the
kind over at Smith’s shaft, from what he
says. Jump up an’ we’ll drive over an’ see.’
“All the way across the paddick things
seemed kind of altered. Here an’ there a
tree had fell, an’ in places the ground was
cracked. When we got to the boundary fence,
blowed if it hadn’t shifted, too! In place of
bein’ straight, it was boomeranged out west
’bout a couple of chain.
“ ‘The disturbance must have gone west,’
sez the boss. ‘Everything is pointin’ that
way.’
“Then we went to look at the fence I’d
strained on Friday. The wires was as tight
as a drum; but the boss called my attention
to the panels. At the east end of every
strain they was only 9ft. to 10ft. long, an’
I was dead-sure they was 12ft. when I
started strainin’. We drove along to the end
of the line, where I'd finished the first day,
has a look at it, when the boss sez: ‘Damn!’
sudden, an’ flogs the horses across to the
other line, an’ lias a squint at that. Then
he drove back to my camp, an’ just as I was
gettin’ out, he spots me strainin’ fork lyin’
agin the tent.
“ ‘ls that what you was usin’?’ he asks,
pointin’ with his whip.
“ ‘Yes,’ I sez.
“ ‘Bill,’ he sez, solemn, ‘that's the blanky
earthquake!’ ”
THE WASTER.
A Tea-room in Hiding.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I FOUND it by accident. Some fresh-
looking cheese in the window of a small,
new grocer’s shop drew me in where a
well-scrubbed grocer, with a smooth
white dome of head like an egg, and pursed-
up lips, waited grimly behind a spotless
counter for customers.
“Good morning,” I muttered. “Half a
pound of your tenpenny cheese, if you
please.”
As he wrapped up the segment of food
neatly in white paper, he gently broke the
news that he had opened a tea-room at the
rear of his shop. “That is the entrance,
sir,” lie explained, with a proud wave of the
hand at a curtain of colored beads in a par-
ticularly dark corner, between a pyramid of
biscuit tins and a pile of kerosene eases. 1
paid him for the cheese, and, impelled by
curiosity, I entered a gloomy, deserted
apartment, filled with round marble-topped
tables and the vicious smell of an angry
kerosene stove. There was a partition in
one corner, and an intermittent hissing and
spluttering indicated that the infernal
machine was concealed there. .
I sat down in a corner seat and waited
to be discovered and fed. The smell of
kerosene got steadily worse. I looked about
for a bell to give the alarm; but, finding
none, coughed in a half-hearted way.
“Oh, dear! I believe someone’s waiting!”
cried an agitated female over the border,
and did something to the stove that enraged
it so that it started to go on like a Chinese
stinkpot.
I was wondering if the angry thing was
getting ready to burst, when a lady in ordin-
ary street dress, and wearing that most ad-
mirable of disguises, an extinguisher hat,
came hurriedly from behind the partition.
“I am very sorry to have kept you,” she said
nervously, and her voice seemed strangely
familiar. “The fact is we are doing practi-
cally nothing to-day, and I was just going-
out to do a little shopping when you”
“WHAT!” I cried, as the light from
the window fell on her chin and mouth.
“Is it—Good Heavens !•—Mrs. Dodgewick !”
I stood up and hurriedly placed a chair for
her. She collapsed into it with a little cry,
and sniffed disconsolately.
“What are you doing here?” I asked
wildly. “You’re not running this place, are
you ?”
She nodded miserably.
“Is Dodgewick?” I began.
She sniffed again and dabbed at her eyes
with an absurdly small scrap of lace. "Mr.
Dodgewick and I have parted for ever,” she
sobbed.
I recognised that I had struck the Dodge-
wick family again at one of their critical
periods, and braced myself for revelations.
When Mrs. Dodgewick had calmed down a
little they came along. “He has started
going about with That Woman again! Last
week we had a dreadful scene, and I told
him I would go back to live at mother’s and
earn my own living. I saw Mr. Vane
spang’s advertisement for a refined lady to
take charge of a tea-room, and started here
last week; but the stove smells dreadfully,
and we’ve only taken Is. 3d.”
A mad hissing from the kerosene stove
made Mrs. Dodgewick jump up and run
behind the scenes to calm the dreadful
thing. I fanned vigorously with my hand-
kerchief at the clouds of stinking smoke roll-
ing over the partition, and wondered how I
could best make my escape.
The extinguisher hat appeared with start-
ling suddenness round the corner of the
partition. “I’m so sorry. I didn’t think of
it before. Did you come in for a cup of
tea ?”
“If it’s not too much trouble,” I answered.
She laughed mirthlessly. “Oh, don’t talk
about trouble,” she replied in the dreariest
possible way. “I’m here to take trouble,
you know. Now, if you don’t mind waiting,
I’ll pump up the stove; it appears to be dy-
ing down.”
In something less than a quarter of an
hour Mrs. Dodgewick, still in full regalia,
brought out a pot of tea, a plate of biscuits,

ARE YOUR KIDNEYS WEAK?
Thousands Have Kidney Trouble and Never Know It.
Weak and unhealthy kidneys are responsible for more sickness
and suffering than any other disease ; therefore, when through
neglect or other causes, kidney trouble is permitted to continue,
fatal results are sure to follow. Your other organs may need
attention —but your kidneys most, because they do most and
need attention first. If you are sick or “ feel badly,” begin
taking D oan’s Backache Kidney Pills, the great kidney and
bladder remedy, because as soon as your kidneys are well they
will help all the other organs to health. A trial will convince
anyone. The advice of friends, of neighbors, of Sydney people
is good, for Sydney testimony is easily proven,
Two Lasting Cures,
Mr. W. James, A’Beckett Street, Granville, says:—“l
strained my back when I was quite a lath and ever since
I have suffered greatly from backache. I tried all kinds
of remedies, but only got temporary relief. My work used
to be very laborious, and I have had to leave it at times
on account of the intense pain. However, Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills cured the backache and strengthened
my back. I always tell friends who suffer from bad backs
to try Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, they are certain to
give relief. It is two years since I used the pills, so my
cure has been well tested.”
Mr. J. Morris, Jtoss Street, Parramatta, says: “For
about IS months I suffered agony from kidney complaint.
I had sharp, shooting pains in rny back, and the kidney
secretions contained sediment. I used so many remedies
without success that I despaired of ever getting better.
However, Mr. Spring, of Ross Street, told me to try
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, saying they had cured
him. I got the pills and about two bottles cured me. It
is over two years since my cure, and as I have been
quite well all that time, it is a thorough cure. I always
tell my friends of the curative properties of Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, and advise their use.”

and two cups; then, in strict accordance
with business traditions, sat down to pour
out. She handed me one cup, and, disre-
garding my start of surprise, took the other
herself.
The stove here tried to commit suicide by
holding its breath ; but, finding that if was
too strong to burst just then, relieved its
feelings by blowing off the accumulated gas
with redoubled fury.
“He can do what he likes with That
Woman now! I don’t want to see him
again, now that I have found a means of
making a living and working up a good
business. Do have another bit of cake!”
I grimly helped myself to cake. Mrs.
imogewick stirred her tea excitedly.
“Where did you say this place was?”
called a liorribly-familiar voice in the shop
outside.
Mrs. Dodgewick half rose and sat down
again. “That’s him!” she hissed, regardless
of grammar.
“Straight on, if you please, sir,” replied
the toothless grocer.
Mrs. Dodgewick huddled over her cup; I
shrank back into the shadow; a hand swept
back half the bead curtain, and That Woman
rustled in and selected a seat in the opposite
corner. Dodgewick followed eagerly, took a
seat on the opposite side of the table, seized
one of the printed menus, and shoved it into
her hands. “What are you going to have,
Kid?” he mumbled in a shamefaced way.
Mrs. Dodgewick was quite effectively con-
cealed by her tremendous hat and the gloom
in which she sat; but in her terror lest the
pair should recognise her, she held the little
menu up against her face and pretended to
be reading it.
That Woman —her real name is Lottie
Something-or-other—put down the menu
Dodgewick had given her and said decisively,
but with a little break in her voice: “I don’t
want anything to eat at all!” It was plain
they had quarrelled.
Dodgewick started to fuss distractedly.
“Oh! but you must have something to eat,
Kid! What is there?” He grabbed the
menu and ran a trembling finger down it.
“What do you say to tea and fruit-cake, eh?
Yes, that’s what we’ll have! Where’s the
bell?” He looked round for a bell.
“He calls her ’Kid’!” hissed Mrs. Dodge-
wick tearfully behind the menu card.
“Sli-li-h! they’ll hear you!” I whispered
warningly, and, picking up another menu
card, glued my eyes to the line, “Stewed
fruits, 3d. extra.” I read it over 35 times
while Dodgewick was winning a reluctant
promise from Lottie that she would have a
cup of tea.
“Where’s the girl?” exclaimed Dodgewick.
He rapped on the marble-topped table with
his walking-stick, and made a futile effort
to capture Lottie’s left hand. She snatched
it away and fanned harder than ever. Be-
hind the partition, the stove hissed steadily
and the kettle commenced to boil over.
“Straight in, if you please!” I think we
all jumped when the bald grocer’s words of
direction broke the silence.
Two factory girls of the quiet variety
came doubtfully in. One of them was wear-
ing smoked glasses; the other bore in her
hand a folded novelette. They established
themselves at the table nearest the window,
and laid their heads together over the menu.
“Rot o’ tea and cake, tlirippence,” read the
one with the novelette in a hoarse whisper
to her short-sighted friend. , “Tea an’ scone,
thrippence. Pot o’ tea an’ ” _
“Look here,” interrupted Dodgewick, * I
wouldn’t wait if I were you ; the girl may
not be back for some time,” . .
“Where’s she gone?” demanded the girl in
smoked glasses aggressively.
“I don’t know,” snapped Dodgewick.
“Nice sorter place!” grumbled the girl.
Then, to her friend: “Allie, go an’ ask the
old bloke in the shop.”
The meek novelette reader rose silently
and went out. Mrs. Dodgewick, wide-eyed
with terror, shrank further back into the
shadow; Dodgewick made another vain at-
tempt to engage Lottie in conversation.
“You must be mistaken, my girl!” Mrs.
Dodgewick and I half rose as the bald
grocer, muttering irritably, dived through
the cascade of beads and looked round. “I’m
sure the lady— Eli?” lie must have been a
very nervous man, judging by the way he
sprang back when he caught us waving at
him.
“SH-H-H-H!” we hissed together, and
pointed at Dodgewick and Lottie.
The round-eyed factory girl, fearing the
worst, made for the door. The girl with
smoked glasses hurried after her.
The bald-headed grocer stood in an agony
of indecision. He was evidently impressed
by our hisses, for he put his hand to his
mouth and whispered hoarsely: “ What’s the
matter? I don’t understand!”
Dodgewick whirled round and made the
awestruck grocer jump by barking at him:
“What the devil are you whispering about?”
“It’s all right, sir,” muttered the grocer,
now thoroughly flustered, fiddling with his
apron.
“It isn’t all right!” shouted Dodgewick.
“I bring a lady in here”
“A LADY ! !” moaned Mrs. Dodgewick.
Dodgewick stopped dead and shrivelled
like a man who had put his foot upon a con-
versational rattlesnake. His eyes bulged in
a peculiar way, his face became purple, and
his head turned slowly from side to side like
that of a beast at bay.
The distraught grocer, seeing his oppor-
tunity, sidled forward. Mechanically—
almost unconsciously—he spoke his here-
ditary and accursed lines: “What can I do
for you, sir?”
Dodgewick gibbered at him; there is no
other way to describe it. “Pah !” he hissed
and flicked his fingers in the grocer’s face.
The grocer without a word turned in the
blue kerosene mist as a frightened fish turns
from a jerked fishing line, and wriggled
through the glass screen into the shop, where
he leant on the cheese with his back to-'
wards us, and stared immovably out of the
door, with his ears laid well back.
I shoved my chair aside and stepoed out
like the hero-fool in the third act. “Dodge-
wick,” I cried —assuredly I must have been
temporarily insane—“Dodgewick, we are
here!”
I looked in my madness to see the man
shrink with shame. To my. utter amaze-
ment after the first shock his eyes blazed
with triumph, and he pointed an accusing
finger dead at my crumb-powdered waist
coat. Caught! he howled. Caught like
rats m a trap .
“Who’s caught?’ I yelled defiantly.
“Who!” he screamed. “Why, you! You
blackguard ! WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HERE WITH MY WIFE?”
I have some recollection of striking an
attitude; of finding Mrs. Dodgewick cling-
ipg tearfully to my arm in the approved way
pf distressed females: of seeing Lottie adopt
a suitable pose (Virtue Dumbfounded); oi
Dodgewick, swollen with unjustifiable
wrath, acting the Stern But Just Husband.
Acting is the word. I realised somewhere
within me that we were all acting that_ it
was just cheap melodrama at the back of a
grocer’s shop which was rapidly going in-
solvent. Still I knew that the scene had
to be plaved out to its absurd conclusion,
whatever that might be.
“Dodgewick!” I cried, “you are making
a terrible mistake!” (“Terrible!” very
heavily accented.)
Pi?, eyes flashed. I lia\e long suspected
this! he cried, in deep, ringing tones.
“You, cur. What have you to say lor your-
se ß*
Then I woke up to the drivelling un-
reality of it all, and snapped hysterically,
• “Oh, don’t be such a d—d fool !”
It was like smashing the window of some
stuffy chamber of absurdities with an honest
brick. In a flash we were all normal
people again. Dodgewick was mouthing
curses under his breath, and trying to open
the window ; Lottie was sniffing miserably
and saying she wanted to go home; and
Mrs. Dodgewick was wailing about the lone-
liness of life without him and the explosive
capacities ot keiosene stoves.
Dodgewick strode magnificently to the
bead screen and roared at the grocer’s back :
“Turn this d—d thing off, do you hear!
Turn it off!”
The grocer came running, and dived
through the screen. The hissing merci-
fully ceased and he tip-toed back to the
shop through the haze.
Then Dodgewick caught his collapsing
wife by the arm, and, looking sternly at me,
spake these solemn words in a thrilling voice
at Lottie, his faithful but superannuated
barmaid, at that moment engaged in dabbing
•i flier eves with a small handkerchief - “Take
at nei eyes witn a small nancu tiune . raise
care of her, Johnson. See that she wants
for nothing, you understand?”
“All right,” I answered without enthusi-
asm>
Dodgewick then tenderly conducted his
wife from the room. I noticed he paused a
moment to say something to the petrified
grocer as they passed slowly out.
Then I turned to Lottie and found her
gazing at me with great, big, mournful eyes.
“Oh, Kid,” she said, “that Woman has no
Soul!”
I rose hastily. “For Heaven’s sake let
us get out into the air.” I groped for my
hat and threw my half-pound of cheese under
thd table. Then, with my head bursting, I
held the bead curtain aside for Lottie to pass
out

[FOR THE BULLETIN.)
C'OR all the ease of the spring-swung car
r And the cushioned air in the rubbet
wheel,
The world moves heavily , all ajar,
On grinding axle and pounding heel.
Yet here is rest when the toil is done.
Buoyant water around , below —
The wind biotas out to the setting sun,
And soft as velvet the currents flow.
The sand is cool to our shoe-burned feet,
The wind is warm on our sun-burned
limbs —
Very beautiful, aye, and sweet,
The flash of the feathering foam that rims
The sweeping curve of the dreaming bay;
So white the foam on the sea’s dark blue—
The blue that stretches away, away,
Where the wind and the sun are going to.
Roars the surf as our heads go down,
Down, and our feet throw water high,
And eyes see clear, where the sunbeams
drown,
The sands of silver whose ripplings try
To raise each ridge to the shape of the sea-
That, marching ever by ways well-trod,
Crush the sand with their heavy knees
And lift their glorious plumes to God.
Up to the sun and the wind again
With a brown arm lifted, a pent breath
blown—
The sea for men and the sons of men—
May every man come into his own!
One shake of the head to clear the eyes
Of the sparkling green of the under-tide,
Then low, stretch low, till the waters rise
On heads that tumble the waves aside.
At every stroke of the sweeping limbs,
The sea gives ever her kind, cool kiss.
Oh ! sea, no lady of moods and whims
Has aught to offer so sweet as this.
So soft you swing us, as light as down,
So lightly hold us, and leave us free
To rob a wave of his snow'-white crown,
Or seek the heart of the under-sea.
Low, swim low till the bubbles blind.
Slow, swim slow lest the muscles tire.
Leave the path to the west behind,
The path for the wind, all paved with fire,
And let us swim to the beach again
With brown arm lifted and slow breath
blown. '
The sea for men and the Sons of men,
Yet the land calls ever to claim her own.
The sand is warm to our sea-cool feet,
The wind is warmer than sun or sand.
Oh ! Freedom glorious, strong and sweet,
We cannot hold you by voice or hand.
We can but steal from you one brief hour
And drain it swiftly of all it holds,
As bees slip into a closing flower
And take the honey before it folds.
Up from the sea where the red sun sank
Blaze all the colors the sunset, sends.
And Night is mustering rank on rank
To fill the world to its utmost ends.
The flower is closing—the dreaming bay
Is robbed of its white and its rich, bright
blue—
Ah r What's to the westward, away, away,
Where the sun and the ivind are going io.

makes the following claims upon your attention
1— It uses cheap lamp oil (such as kerosene), and other residuals.
2 The oil is injected directly into the cylinder, thus dispensing with unre-
liable and inefficient vaporisers.
3 It is very simple in construction, there being no electric ignition or other
complicated mechanism.
4 Its speeds are such that electric generators and centrifugal pumps may
be coupled direct.
5 No skilled labor is required, the supply of fuel and lubricant being all
the attention necessary.

get out of repair, and so it will be easy to keep in
good working condition. It must be economical, so
that it will not eat up the profits that it makes for
y? u - mus t be dependable because that is the only
kind oi an engine you can rely on. And your engine
must be durable so that it will keep on paying you big
dividends year after year.
Very few engines meet these requirements, yet
® no need to take chances. Choose the
FARMER’S FRIEND” OIL ENGINE. They have
proved their worth in all kinds of work, in pumping

HOWTO
GROW HAIR
A Simple, Safe and Reliable Way that Produces Surprising Results.
NEW PREPARATION CAUSES BIG STIR AMONG HAIR SPECIALISTS.
dfg
The above clearly shows Results from a Short Course of my True Hair-Growing Compound.
10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, ' etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. 1 invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying- a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
.spare some of his hair for my benefit. This led him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that 1 have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later. I
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered bv a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. I do not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world—l am
not interested in decrying others —but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cheapest.
