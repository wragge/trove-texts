MELBURNIAN'S MEMORIES
On the way to his first century, in
his middle-eighties, to be exact, Alan
D. Mickle looks back in After the
Ball (Cheshire) on the sporting world,
particularly the Melbourne sporting
world.
He was at Melbourne Grammar
when Viscount Bruce was captain of
the school; when he had his appendix
out in 1901 he was eight months in
hospital; and he was so sick after he
came out of hospital that he was sent
to Scone, to stay with his uncle the
cricketer, Dr. H. J. Scott, who had
the wonderful story about Murdoch,
1884 Test captain, which proves that
the much-maligned Bradman didn’t
invent Test-match efficiency:—
Percy McDonnell had made over
100 before he got out, and nearing
the end of the day the Australian
score was over 300, and only one
wicket had fallen. With the game
at this stage my uncle ran down the
pitch and lifted the ball over the
fence for six. Thereupon Murdoch
walked up to him and said, “Good
God, Tup, have you gone mad?”
He considers Trumper and Brad-
man the two greatest batsmen he has
ever seen, and says that although they
didn’t look strong, what was remark-
able was the speed of their strokes.
He writes about old-style country
cricket at Narbethong, and coach-
races between opposing teams in the
moonlight on narrow bush roads,
cricket in Fiji and Samoa, a celebrated
Melbourne divorce case, and Bedford’s
poem (signed “Martin Luther”) on
the mysterious “Mr. Strauss” who
figured in its background, and the
English cricketer who had visited the
lady’s house, called “Novar,” and the
barracker who barracked the cricketer:
“Another maiden Novar, Len”; the
old days of wrestling, fishing and
horseracing; school games.
He even has something to say about
pelota and bullfighting, while among
his best European memories is the
story of the woman who burst in upon
him and his wife in a flat in Belgium,
mistaking them for her husband and
the girl he was living with in the flat
above. But his most unusual essay
is on broadcasting. He must be the
first member of the public to recount
the occasions of his having been
interviewed on the air, although his
best story of a member of the public
and a microphone is about a visitor
from overseas, interviewed in a ship’s
cabin, who turned to his wife and
said, “How did I go, Nancy?!’ and she
said, with the microphone still open,
“Bloody awful.” There is something
disturbingly universal in this, about
men foolish enough to ask their wives
how they go.
The Zimmermann Telegram
Barbara W. Tuchman in her intro-
duction to The Zimmermann Telegram
(Constable) very neatly and nicely
knocks on the head an unfortunate—
though fortunately anonymous;—Lon-
don “Times” reviewer, who, when a
war-history came out in 1957, guile-
lessly remarked. “We still do not
know, at any level that really matters,
why Wilson took the fateful decision
to bring the United States into the
First World War.” Mrs, Tuchman,
having rediscovered the Zimmermann
Telegram, just says she would like to
“say hello” to this poor scribe.
Yet the Zimmermann Telegram
was, in a sense, a harmless, almost a
meaningless document; not really a
justifiable casus belli. It was the
famous telegram which (using the
American’s own cable-system which
Wilson, most incorrectly, had been
making available to the Germans)
Zimmermann. the German Foreign
Secretary, sent to his ambassador in
Washington, Count von Bernstoff;
and, when deciphered by the experts
in Britain’s Room 40. who had been
tranquilly reading Germany’s diplo-
matic and naval codes since 1915, it
read as follows:
We propose to begin on February
1 unrestricted submarine warfare.
In doing this however we shall
endeavor to keep America neutral
...(?) If we should not (? succeed
in doing so) we propose (? Mexico)
an alliance upon the following
basis: (joint) conduct of war,
(joint) conclusion of peace . . . Your
Excellency should for the present
inform the President of [? Mexico]
secretly (? that we expect) war with
the U.S.A. (possibly) . . . (Japan)
and at the same time negotiate be-
tween us and Japan . . . Please tell
the President that . . . our sub-
marines . . . will compel England to
peace within a few months.
Acknowledge receipt. Zimmermann.
All this, of course, was explosive
enough; and when, before handing the
telegram over to the Americans, Room
40 worked-out one of the blank pas-
sages and found that Germany, as well
as suggesting an alliance between.
Mexico and Japan to attack the U.S.,
was promising to assist Mexico “to
regain by conquest her lost territories
in Texas, Arizona and New Mexico,”
it was more explosive still. Moreover,
there was a subsequent telegram,
which for some odd reason was never
revealed to the U.S. public, though
Room 40 once again obligingly told
Wilson what had been going on over
his cable-system, suggesting that the
German ambassador in Mexico should
not wait for American entry into the
war to negotiate the alliance, but
should start “even now.”
But, as Mrs. Tuchman somewhat
bewilderedly admits, well on in her
book, the original Zimmerman Tele-
gram did not suggest that Mexico
should go to war with the U.S. at once,
but only if America joined in. It was,
at least on the face of it, a precaution
rather than an incitement to war; and
there was considerable substance, in
the opinion of Senator Oscar Under-
wood of Alabama, who, to Mrs.
Tuchman’s indignation,
. . . defended Zimmermann on the
ground that he was merely instruc-
ing his envoy in Mexico what to do
in case the United States should
declare war on Germany, a perfectly
proper procedure taken with no
“unfriendly intention” (!) towards
the United States.
Mrs. Tuchman may be allowed her
exclamation-mark, for it could hardly
be said these were friendly proposals;
but neither were they, at that point,
actively hostile; and she is certainly
wrong when she says that Zimmer-
mann and the American pacifists, who
adopted this argument, could have
been blown-out at once by publication
of the “even now” telegram: for even
this one did not say that Mexico
should go to war “now,” or that Ger-
many was going to war with America

THE DARKER CONTINENTS
/"\NLY three Western voices of any
influence seem to speak clearly at
the moment —those of Mr. Macmillan,
Mr. Menzies and Mr. Diefenbaker, all
of whom have clearcut policies, and
all of whom are listened to. The
American voice is far from clear.
De Gaulle, no doubt, could speak
very plainly on international affairs
if he wished to do so. But he prefers
to stand on the sidelines for the
moment, ready to attract attention
when he can achieve a dominating
influence. He has a quality given to
few statesmen —the power to wait with
infinite patience for his moment.
In Germany the voices become more
muffled as Dr. Adenauer advances
in age and prepares to transfer to the
Presidency, an office which, whatever
he intends, is likely to take him out
of the arena of politics. The Federal
Republic is seeing something Ger-"
many has never seem before —a
scramble,, which is more British than
Continental, for the Chancellorship,
with plenty of canvassing and
caballing.
And it is noticeable that Dr.
Adenauer’s choice is not that of the
parties which supported him. He has
made it clear that his Finance Minis-
ter, Herr Etzel, is his chosen nominee,
but his party’s support is for Herr
Erhard, the Vice-Chancellor, who is
looked on as economic miracle-wesrker.
There is nothing in Germany or in
any other Western European country
which indicates political split in-
ternally, though the international
cracks seem to be widening,
and the advent of Professor
Erhard would bring into office
one who is described in some
quarters as a “bad. European,” which
means one who is not so ready for
accord- with the adjacent nations in
such matters as the plans of the
European Coal and Steel Community.
T OOKING at Europe, indeed—
except for Berlin and the
glowering East European satel-
lites, especially Albania, which has
been kept out of United Nations by
the veto of the U.K. and U.S.A., and
where Khrushchev is at present laired-
up with a gaggle of Red Army generals
hatching mischief —one could say that
the Continent is reasonably stable.
And it is noticeable that the policy
of the Kremlin is to keep eyes centred
there while every kind of mischief
brews elsewhere.
The- main pages of any European
journal (where the interest is less on
legs and night-clubs than here, even
among politicians and the press) make
sad reading when they deal with Asia
and Africa. Africa is torn with racial
struggle. In the south the Bantu Self-
government Bill, which aims to abolish
native representation in the Union
Parliament and establish native zones
of self-government in segregated re-
serves. has produced raging debate,
which mostly seems to be carried on
by white long-hairs and local Com-
munists in alliance with natives who
owe their educations to the British
universities and Inns of Court which
receive all colored persons with open
arms. In the north the Algerian rebels
mill round —they killed 24 French last
week —and Nasser whizzes from sup-
port to Moscow to support of the
West with the velocity of an accom-
plished trapeze artist, pending his one-
party election on Moscow lines-now
in the offing.
TN Kenya. Belgian Congo and the
A West African countries and colonies
all is raucous and bad-tempered, while
the wire from the Rhodesias hums
with the news that some hotel has
refused a room to a Ghana barrister.
In Asia the situation is worse. Tibet
reports the arrival of Russians to
join in the final extermination of
Buddhist rule. From Burma, where
even the press began pelting the
Soviet Embassy with tomatoes, to
Israel, where the local authorities
forced a Lebanese aircraft to land, the
row goes on.
The schools run by religious bodies
in Communist Kerala have closed
to prevent children being brainwashed;
the Communist Prime Minister of the
State is giving Mr. Nehru new head-
aches with his threats and demands.
Russian troops are at Herat, and
the Prime Minister of Afghanistan
has gone to Moscow on a visit and
was met at the airport by Khrushchev
and Mikoyan. A Yemen delegation
is in Aden trying to settle differences.
The Communist press reported the
suppression of a new revolt by
“gangsters armed by the Western im-
perialists” in northern Iraq. The
Turkish Opposition has walked-out of
the House because of disturbances
against the venerable Ismet Inonii, its
leader, hero of the Greek War.
The Trotskyists have deserted from
Bandaranaike in Ceylon a lot of
people suspect that they are really
Leninists in disguise—breaking-up the
coalition and reducing him to the
support of his own Sri Lanka party.
Malaya has been plunged in a whirl-
ing feast of elections, seasoned with
the propaganda of a newly-risen
Islam party to challenge the supremacy
of the Malay-Chinese-Indian bloc <and
the strident and cunning Communists.
One effect seems to have been to
bring Chinese to the polls against the
threat of Islam, while blazing quarrels
and charges, mostly emanating from
the Left, have erupted in the vicinity of
the Singapore City Council; the smells
of scandal arise from at least two
public inquiries, and the press is
flustered at the threat by Lee Kuan-
yew, head of the Left People’s Action
party. He has anounced that if he - °
the poll on May 30, which r -
“any editor who tries to sour-up rela-
tions between Singapore and Malaya
after May 30 will go up for subversion
. . . taken in under the public security
ordinance and kept in.” The Com-
munist wing, in fact, proposes to use
against the Singapore press a law
designed -to deal with Communist
subversion.
pURTHER east, again. South
Vietnam is protesting against
two violations of the Geneva
accords of 1954, discovered when
the French Navy found the
Czechs trying to smuggle 581 tons
of arms and 1000 heavy machine-guns
into North Vietnam, where the second
leg of the complaint was the presence
of numerous Russian and Chinese
military advisers working with the
Army of the Communist Government.
The agreement at Geneva was specific
about the arrangements on these two
points.
But the Communist element has no
more respect for this agreement than
for any other, or than it has for the
freedom of its fellow U.N.-member,
Laos, which has just been compelled
to round-up an infiltrated Communist
force, Chinese-armed, within a few
miles of its capital of Luang Prabang.
This incident arose out of another
breach of agreement.
From hour to hour in Asia nothing
happens in which Communists are
involved that can’t be linked either to
Peking or Moscow direct, and which
doesn’t excite the intense interest of
the Communist capitals. It all seems
part of a concerted Communist policy
to divert attention from some larger
game in the making.


WEEK-END WAIL
“In Sydney’s fair city, where girls are so pretty,
I just heard the voice of sweet Ernie O’Dea,
As he pushed his old barrow, through streets wide and narrow
Singing ‘Friday-night shopping, and not Sat-ur-day!’ ”


PLAIN ENGLISH
Reds in Singapore
The results of the Singapore election are
obscured by the usual anxiety of the
daily press to prove that a movement
which is actuated by Communism is not
Communist and is led by moderates.
It did this in the cases of Czechoslovakia,
Syria, Iraq and elsewhere, yet invariably
the pattern develops in which Commun-
ism lurks behind nationalism until the
“moderate” leaders, who are always in
control at first, begin falling-out win-
dows or dying of strange diseases ; or, as
in Iraq, where the transition was easier,
being arrested and knocked-off after
mock trials.
The new Singapore Government is
born of the operations of the kind of
rabble that had the support of the
Australian press during the war, with
the demand that it be armed, and which
after the war became the plaything of
the Communist vanguard and cost thous-
ands of lives before it was nearly eradi-
cated by British Commonwealth effort in
Malaya.
The pointer to the real position is
that where the Communist movement has
been wiped-out in the main States of
Malaya there is little chance of the
young Chinese element winning an
election.
In Singapore the corpus of the leader-
ship consists of young university and
professional men of the types which form
the bulk of the parlor-pinks in the Aus-
tralian and British universities, and often
prove to be Communists in disguise.
Their backing are the Teddy-boys of
politics, from high-school upwards, and
particularly the Teddy-girls, who are
peculiarly vigorous specimens in China
and Malaya. The driving-force lies in
the Chinese, and their leader speaks
National Chinese in preference to the old
Cantonese trading-language which used
to be spoken by most of the Singapore
Chinese.
The policy is to wipe-out British
influence, and in a huge trading-post in
a state of flux which has more than
trebled its Chinese population since the
war, that is easier to achieve than under
the old conditions. Though Singapore
becomes a State of the Commonwealth
without any control from Britain except
that imposed during the years of take-
over, - the Government will not regard
it as a British State, but as one from
which British and Western defence must
be excised, even at the loss of 40,000
jobs, the cutting-out of which, as in
Malta, will add to the dislike of the
British, who are always supposed to keep
employment alive while the new regimes
abuse them and devise means of finally
getting rid of them.
The new Administration- professes a
desire for union with Malaya Federation,
but there is no chance of it. It quite
obviously will use this platform for the
subversion of Malaya and the softening-
up of its policies towards Red China and
Communism. The six leaders of the
Communists, all dangerous men, who
are interned in Singapore, will probably
be released as the beginning of the real
Communist campaign. Then will come
the Red-anting of the industrial plants,
the arming of worker’s cadres, the
pushing-aside of the moderates, the visits
to Peking and/or Moscow, the help from
the Soviet Union, and—the deluge.
There seems to be no help for it, and
it adds to the importance of Australia
to the Western world, making more urgent
the development of its resources. Also,
it makes more silly the cliche adopted
by Sir Percy Spender and others that
Australia is part of South-east Asia and
that its policy should be for closer
integratihn.
Australia is a thousand years away
from Asia. The sooner it is recognised
that it is an entity on its own with a
different racial outlook and problems the
better it will be for progress and security.
The Red Carpet
The inexorable penetration of the trade-
union movement is illustrated at the
current meeting of the A.C.T.U. inter-
state executive meeting in Melbourne,
where the issue is whether Communist
trade-unionists should be invited to tour
Australia under the auspices of the
A.C.T.U.
It is only two years since the non-
Communists held what seemed like a
reasonably firm grip on the A.C.T.U.,
and co-operation with the Common-
wealth Government on labor matters was
speedily effected to the advantage of both
parties and the country.
The basis of representation on the
A.C.T.U. was then changed. It was
obvious at the time that this would
aid representationally the militant
unions, but it was worked without undue
publicity, and, it is now suspected, with
the connivance of the Melbourne Trades
Hall, which was deeply committed on
unity-tickets to the Communists and had
been bluffed into a state of humble grati-
tude to the Reds for permitting them to
take the junior share of union offices.
The smooth reason advanced by the
Reds for the proposed invitations is that,
as the A.C.T.U. has accepted invitations
from Communist countries to send
observers, the exchange of visitors has,
in fact, been approved.
These “observers” and their opinions
were put in proper perspective in Mel-
bourne last week when Bishop Thomas
Quinlan, who has been in China or
Korea since he was a young R.C. mis-
sionary, arrived in Melbourne on
missionary business and calmly explained
that they were taken on conducted tours
of shop-window displays and returned
to their own countries to talk through
their hats.
D.L.P. unions, such as the Clerks’ (and
some others) have threatened to withhold
affiliation-fees if the A.C.T.U. sponsors
the tours ; but with the Reds and their
henchmen “almost dominating the key
trade-union organisation the final result
is certain.
Third-party Scrutiny
Very wide terms of reference have been
laid down for the royal commission in
Victoria on third-party insurance, and
none of the important conditions of this
class of insurance which now operate
will escape evaluation.
An influential and substantial body
of opinion (including the insurance
companies) in Melbourne has been grow-
ing restive at the high cost of third-party
premiums, and the unexpressed hope of
the Government is, no doubt, that a
satisfactory answer will be found by the
commissioner.
The most interesting terms of reference
are whether the accident-prone driver
should pay more and the accident-free
driver less in premiums, and whether the
culpable driver should be made to pay
part of the damages awarded against
him.
Dr. Coppel is also asked to recommend
whether liability and damages should be
decided by a jury or a judge alone,
whether liability should be judged by a
jury and damages assessed by a judge
alone, or whether liability should be
judged by a judge and damages assessed
by a jury.
Of lesser importance, generally, are
the questions whether the driver as well
as the owner of a car should carry third-
party insurance (and how it could be
effected); whether country-based vehicles
should continue to be insured at a
cheaper rate than those in the city, and
which class of passengers, if any, should
be excluded from insurance indemnities
The commission will not begin its open
sittings until July. Its appointment
follows swiftly on the publication of the
latest accident statistics showing an
unhealthy increase. Nothing is better
calculated to get officialdom moving on
motorage problems in Victoria than an
arresting increase in the road-toll.
Calweii and Foreign Capital
Arthur Calwell has probably given up
hope of ever becoming Federal Treasurer,
but he still takes great delight in jugg-
ling with large numbers to produce
fantastic results. After Senator Spooner,
at the opening of the new Ronson factory
at Lane Cove, near Sydney, had quoted
figures on overseas investment in Aus-
tralia, Calwell rushed into print to prove
that this country, far from gaining on
this score, had lost from it.
Spooner had said that the amount of
overseas capital invested annually in Aus-
tralian industry had risen from £37
million in 1946-47 to about £IOO million
in the three years 1954-57. Profits earned
by overseas capital had averaged about
10 per cent, in the decade 1948-57. Of
this, about half had been remitted
abroad; the rest had been ploughed-


back into industry or reinvested in this
country. In that decade private overseas
investment in companies in Australia,
including reinvested profits, was more
than £7OO million—64 per cent, of which
came from Britain and 27 per cent, from
America and Canada.
Calwell, by taking a shorter period and
weighing the capital-inflow against
profits remitted plus profits reinvested, has
decided that Australia lost £75,600,000
in the five years 1952-57. The fallacy,
of course, is that his profit-figure includes
profits on all capital invested, not merely
on that coming-in during the five years ;
also, he regards the profits reinvested as
money ultimately lost to Australia —a
process of reasoning which ignores the
expansion of industry and employment
made possible by the reinvestment.
The childish belief that overseas
interests should be prepared to invest
their capital here without taking anything
out of the couSry in dividends is very
popular with Labor politicians. It is
reasonable to ask overseas companies to
admit Australian capital to co-partnership
in Australian ventures, but that is quite
a different thing from scaring them away
by suggesting that there is something
criminal in their expecting a return on
the money they invest here.
The Mt. Isa Railway
[From Canberra]
Queensland Treasurer Hiley and Mt.
Isa Mines general-manager G. R. Fisher
will have to do some very fast talking
in Washington to succeed where, so far,
Prime Minister Menzies has failed, to
obtain an International Bank loan for
the reconstruction of the Mt. Isa-
Townsville railway.
Senior Government officials, from Mr.
Menzies down, thought the loan was a
foregone conclusion once Menzies got to
Washington and whispered in the ears of
International Bank officials.
They got the surprise of their lives
when the bank gave Mr. Menzies a
polite refusal, pending further-investiga-
tion of the matter.
Negotiation of the £22-million loan
was one of the stated objectives of
Menzies’s visit to Washington, but the
bank has apparently decided to play it
tough and wants to have talks not with
Mr. Menzies, but with Queenslanders
who are right on the spot.
As a result Messrs. Hiley and Fisher,
together with an unnamed Common-
wealth Treasury official, will fly to
Washington almost immediately to plead
their case.
One of the main objections of the bank
to granting the loan at this stage is the
cut-back in production at Mt. Isa —
ironically as a result of American pres-
sure on all lead- and zinc-producers.
The bank believes that with reduced
production the expenditure of £29 million
in all (£7 million of it by the Queens-
land Government), might not be justified
at this stage.
It will be the job of Hiley and Fisher
to persuade the bank that even with
reduced production, output at the mine
will still be enough to warrant reconstruc-
tion of the line.
And they both‘say they can produce
plenty of evidence to support their repre-
sentations.
Thinking Big
The astonishing progress of Australian
science in the field of rocket-propulsion
and nuclear science is demonstrated by
the two missiles sent up for experimental
purposes on the rocket-range to an alti-
tude of 100 miles a few days ago and
the photographing of the U.S. Vanguard
at a range of 2500 miles by Australian
scientists.
The Commonwealth is about to enter
the field of major satellite experiment
in partnership with the United Kingdom
and the United States. So it seems the
time may well have come when its
nuclear-research in particular, to which
such great contributions have been made
by Australasians from Rutherford, who
first split the atom, to Thonemann, who
first paved the way to harnessing fusion-
power to peaceful needs, may be chan-
nelled to serve our own problems.
The Russians, who are claiming to
have developed a tunnelling technique
based on atomic explosions, and the
Americans, who are proposing to dig
a “nuclear” Panama Canal with hydrogen-
bombs, have opened-up new possibilities
—if there is any practicality behind their
claims.
No country needs so much as Aus-
tralia the means for digging artificial
rivers and great water = storage projects
in reasonably short periods.
The American plan has recently been
completed, on paper, by the Californian
Research Station at Livermore for the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission.
Washington has no fewer than five
conventional schemes before it for either
new canals or enlargements and deepen-
ing of the existing one to cope with
promised expansion of traffic.
If the nuclear scheme is practical
politics there is room for at least bold
thinking in Australia about the problem
of water in the dry interior.
N.S.W. Housing Report
Towards the end of last year, with an
election coming-up and very few gim-
micks left in the bag, N.S.W. Premier
Cahill called a conference to discuss the
housing-shortage, and out of this arose
the N.S.W. Housing Advisory Commit-
tee, which was asked to discuss and
recommend ways of overcoming the
shortage.
The committee’s opinion is that lack
of finance is the most urgent factor of
the housing problem, but, realising that
there is little the State Government can
do about this, it confines its recommenda-
tions to a suggestion that permission
should be sought for private savings-
banks to increase the proportion of their
deposits available for housing-loans.
There’s also a suggestion that the
Government should make short-term
loans to councils to enable them to
undertake subdivisions of land on a non-
profit basis, selling the land to prospec-
tive homebuilders. The claim is that this
would reduce the cost of land, which the
committee feels now represents too high
a proportion of the total cost of a home.
Practical suggestions for reducing the
cost of homes include a reduction in the
minimum height of ceilings from 9ft. to
Bft.; the acceptance of a shower-recess
as adequate provision for bathing
facilities; specific requirements for
septic tanks ; more liberal use of cast-
piping ; permission for washing-machines
to be installed in the bathrooms of flats ;
wider use of-new materials and methods
and a greater uniformity in local-govern-
ment building requirements.
Some of these suggestions have been
urged for years by the building industry
and by architects, but municipal councils
have tended to be very conservative
towards new building developments. The
report gives the Government a chance to
bring local-government thinking on this
subject up to date. Whether it will take
the opportunity remains to be seen.
High Explosives
[From Canberra]
A large number of Members of Parlia-
ment —-many of them on the Government
side—are going to ask the Government
to do some explaining on defence when
Parliament resumes for the Budget
session. '
Unrest over defence, particularly
among back-benchers on the Govern-
ment side, has been running high, but
the latest announcement by Army
Minister John Cramer that Australia is
buying ammunition for the 105 mm.
howitzers from America is likely to light
the fuse.
When the St. Marys ammunition-
filling plant was decided on a couple of
years ago, at a cost of almost £3O million,
supporters of the scheme claimed that
not only would it provide small-arms
ammunition for the Australian forces
but it might also manufacture the 105 mm.
howitzer, under licence from the Yanks,
and would certainly produce the ammuni-
tion for it.
So far very little small-arms ammuni-
tion has been forthcoming, and, far from
manufacturing either the howitzer or its
ammunition, the Government has spent
just on £3 million buying these very items
from America.
The Government has reversed its plans
to do away with the old 25-pounder as
an integral part of field equipment, the
R.A.A.F. is still no nearer being equipped
with modern aircraft, and numbers for
the three defence services are well below
planned target-strengths.
Defence is the one weak spot in the
Government’s administration that can
make it vulnerable to attacks, not so much
from the disunited, schism-happy Opposi-
tion, but from within its own ranks.
Inter-service bickerings have added to
the confusion in the defence set-up.

on to the permanent-way. Three hefty
young fellows dived to his rescue and
hoisted him back on to the platform
with a no-more-than-comfortable margin
before the train swept in. His split-
second reaction was a haymaker which
connected with the nearest of his three
rescuers. Then, to dispel any impression
that he was striking at random, he swung
an uppercut into the midriff of the

“Manamoi”: Enforced removal of
veranda awning-posts from streets of
country towns, now the policy of most

is not universally popular. Many build-
ings are not suitable for cantilever

unprotected, and shop-windows and
hotel-bedroom walls are exposed to the
full glare of the sun. There are some
who object to the appearance of tidied-
up and modernised country towns, claim-
ing that they all look alike and have
lost their Australian atmosphere. In
Walgett there is an Association for the

had a chip about that structure. “It’s
the best city hall in Australia,” she shot
back, loyally. “In fact, it’s the only one.
All the other cities call theirs the ‘Town
Hall.’ ” I didn’t have the heart to contra-
dict the girl.; but I knew of one other.
Parramatta had a “Town Hall” until, in

interested to know that this particular
effort stands over 15in. high, is of
heavy cast-iron, and without the long
handle deemed so necessary for the old
bed-warmers. The valve at the top, far
from being suitable for emptying the
concern, would be difficult to use, when
you could unscrew the lid and pour out
the six gallons or so of water it would
contain. Besides, it would take two
people to handle it effectively when full
of water, while supporting its weight

locked safe as a means of proving the
truth of spiritualism. But there is yet
a strong chance of the author revisiting
this vale. If a report of what is being

“Bo”: Some, I concede, may predicate
with reasonable accuracy the merging of
autumn into winter by noting the transi-

Others may pin their faith to the time
when the politicians stampede out of
Canberra to hole-up in their fur-lined
igloos until the party-whip makes a noise
like a Budget to bring ’em back to
Molongloside. The outbreak of hawks
and sniffs and sneezes of the seasonal
diseases which make such a delightful
obbligato to the rattle of train-wheels over
rail-joints, and the rash of TV- and radio-
plugs for decongestants, are also held by
some to be reliable guides. Yet others
will decide for the appearance in the rag-
shops of soup-an’-fish suits, bed-sox,
extra-wide woollen ties for auxiliary use


as chest-warmers, and, for bookies, hicky-
hocks, union-officials and other tycoons,
mink-lined underpants. The nature-lover
may settle for the time when the bulldog-
ant becomes so torpid and unaggressive
that he will only massage your finger
instead of sinking the nippers. The
delicious feeling an “iceberg” gets when
his vertebrae seems to disintegrate at the
first plunge also has its points as a pre-
cursor of the Big Freeze. But for myself, I
rely on the one unfailing harbinger: when
the first press-photos appear of goose-
pimpled mannequins cracking hardy while
modelling next summer’s swimsuits.

flat and spiceless in- comparison with
present-day shockers.

“Paris has decreed that the ‘soft contour’

That sack, as quite a dream-
Frock, with its making meaning so
much less work.
To the bod. it scarce adhered;
The size of bust and beam,
Of midriff —this was ait reduced
to guesswork.
Worse, the wearer was required —
Vital corollary! —
To droop hunch-shouldered, sagging
in the middle.
And the gallant one who squired
An Eve so clothed — well, he
Took what was in the clobber as a
riddle.
Women, who love to think
That no longer they’re in thrall
To man, that they’ve gained full
emancipation.
Still accept without a blink
His dictatorship in all
Pertaining to habiliment-creation.
So the sack they'll watch him dump ;
The relaxed-line will be axed.
On vit.-stats, men may now resume
their betting.
For revealing curves they’ll plump.
Lovers’ nerves will be less taxed
When they can take a screw at what
they’re getting!

Schoolboy Rhymes of 40 Years Ago
By IAN MUDIE
At, though I often over-
hear the conversations
of schoolboys, it seems
to me that, possibly
driven out by the talkies dnd
the wireless, most of the rhymes
and songs that were current in
my own schooldays, 40 years
ago, have fallen out of know-
ledge, at least in my own State,
if not elsewhere.
Certainly it seems that one
rhyme that will not die is the
end-of-term doggerel:
Ten more days and we shall, be
Out of the gates of misery;
No more Latin, no more French,
No more sitting on a hard, hard
bench.
However, the fact that mensa
is Latin for “table” seems no
longer celebrated in that old
reflection of struggles with the
first declension:
Mensa, mensa, mensam,
A table full of raspberry jam.
And although the old
mnemonic rhyme,
Sixteen-hundred and sixty-five,
Half London left alive;
Sixteen-hundred and sixty-six,
All London burnt like sticks,
seems to linger on, possibly
kept alive by history-masters,
it is a long time since I came
across any secondhand school-
book that had, written on the
fly-leaf, the warning
Black is the raven, blacker the rook,
But blackest the crook who pinches
this book.
The failure of that rhyme to
hold its popularity shocks me
as much as to be told by a
junior French-master that no
longer do boys who are* sup-
posed to say “Four, sir,” in
French (“ Quatre, monsieur”)
shout “Cat manure!”
The old rhymes of abuse
seem to have gone completely.
The threat of tale-bearing no
longer brings a cry of
Tell 'er, tell ’er,
Buy a new , umbrella,
And chuck her down the cellar.
No longer, either, is the tale-
bearer treated to the ribald
shout that used to begin “Tell
tale tit....” Also, I recently
found two 10-year-olds who
had never heard *a display of
ill-temper in a fellow-student
greeted by shouts of
Cross-patch,
Lift the latch,
And let your neighbors in.
(I can still no more see the
sequence of thought in that one
than I could when I first heard
it, round about 1918.)
TThere were two cries, only
one of which was rhymed,
that fell out of use with chang-
ing conditions. One was the
shout of “Willy, willy, whip
behind,” given when an un-
popular boy was seen to be
having a free “willy,” unknown
to the driver, on the back of a
cart or a trolly. The other was
the race-conscious chant that
followed at a safe distance
“The modern Army with its devastating Weapons needs
highly specialised men.”
behind the jogging backs of
Chinese hawkers:
Ching-chong-Chinaman,
M uchee, m lichee sad,
Ching-chong-Chinaman,
Muchee, muchee mad.
And, of course, advertising has
made the small boys of today
so well-informed regarding the
intimate garments of girls and
worsen that they would prob-
ably think it kids’ stuff to chant
derisively to a girl whose
underwear they had happened
to glimpse:
Poppy show, poppy show;
How far up do your bloomers go ?
One rhyme that was current
in my boyhood reflected
1914-18 sentiment regarding
the respective national colors
of England and Germany. It
was the odd
Red, white and black,
The dirty laughing - jack;
Red, white and blue,
The lovely cockatoo.
The topical nature of that
verse made it almost inevitable
that it would disappear from
use. However, I find it hard to
account for the passing of the
strange rhymes that gave our
youthful hearts the satisfactory
sensation of feeling ourselves
to be foul-mouthed swearers.
There was:
Once upon a time there were three
Jews,
Who all went down by train and
tram
To live in a place called Amster —
Ssh . . ssh .. . ssh .. . naughty
word.
'Also:
Nebuchadnezzar, the king of the
Jews,
Sold his wife for a pair of shoes.
When the shoes began to wear
Nebuchadnezzar began to swear.
When the swear began to stop
Nebuchadnezzar bought a shop.
When the shop began to sell
Nebuchadnezzar went to H-e-l-l-l.
(The fact that Nebuchadnezzar
was king of Babylon, not of
the Jews, didn’t worry me ;
however, I wa§ puzzled by that
final letter in the word Hell.
Apparently there were some
things to which I thought
poetic licence should not apply.)
And, again:
There wm an old woman, as I’ve
heard tell,
Who went and died and went to .. .
well,
It might have been England, it
might have been France,
But it wasn’t Heaven by any chance.
(Needless to say, the old
woman in the first line of that
one often had to give way, the
name of an unpopular master
being inserted in place of the
reference to her.) Allied to
this type of rhyme was the
“Gutz’s Grace,” which always
made us laugh, no matter how
often it was repeated:
Two, four, six, eight,
Tuck in, don’t wait.
There was also that parody
of a child’s bedtime prayer.
Matthew, Mark, Luke, John,
Guard the bed that I lie on.
One to watch and one to pray,
And one to keep the fleas away.
What the fourth evangelist
was doing at the time I never
found out. (A variant of this
is still current, the second line
reading “Hold the horse while
1 get on.”) Oh, yes, and talk-
ing about beds, there was the
rhymed saying “Snug as a bug
in a rug,” which I’m glad to
say is still popular.
Qome of the repetitive songs
were probably composed
by adults long before they were
adopted by schoolboys—they
didn’t carry the true schoolboy
stamp of youthful exuberance.
Among them was “Obadiah”:
Said the young Obadiah to the old
Obadiah,
“Obadiah, Obadiah, I’m so dry.”
Said the old Obadiah to the young
Obadiah,
“Obadiah, Obadiah, so am I.”
That one was often sung, as
was the roaring “Lord Nelson,”
which went to the tune of
“Auld Lang Syne”:
Lord Nelson was
Lord Nelson was
Lord Nelson was
Lord Nelson.
Lord Nelson was
Lord Nelson waj 1
Lord Nelson was
Lord Nelson.
(The last “Nelson” was always
cut off very short.)

POLITICAL POINTS
A usually reliable source reports that
the two unwise monkeys who made the
first successful trip into space and back
saw nothing, heard nothing and refused
to say anything.
• •
May 27, the expiry date of Khrush-
chev's ultimatum over West Berlin,
passed without any fireworks either in
Berlin or East Germany. The four
Foreign Ministers were in Washington
attending the funeral of John Foster
Dulles and Mr. K. was in Albania telling
factory-workers that the international
situation was “not a bad one —one might
even say it is good.”
In Mr. K.’s diplomatic lexicon that
could mean anything—or nothing. On his
12-day trip to the Communist back-alley
in the Balkans he was accompanied by
East German Premier Grotewohl, and
the two were joined on Friday by Marshal
Peng Teh-huai, Red China’s deputy-
Premier and Defence Minister. The three
went into a huddle from which Khrush-
chev emerged at intervals to threaten
Albania’s neighbors with missile-bases
pointed in their direction if they allowed
Nato bases to be created in their terri-
tory. It’s possible, of course, that the
Red rocket-bases, like the submarine-
pens, are already there.

Immigration Minister Downer seems
to have chosen his words well when
speaking in Athens. He said that Greek
girls migrating to Australia would be
welcomed “with open arms.”

Although the Prime Minister is over-
seas, both he and Dame Pattie managed
to hit the poster-boards last week. One
Sydney fortnightly flaunted Bob as “a
neglected poet”; a weekly, “Dame Pattie
as a Swaggie.”

An American group seeking to import
Australian fat-lambs has approached the
Government and has received an
assurance that an export-permit will be
issued for an initial shipment of up to
30,000. If this shipment is successful,
export-licences will be issued for further
shipments up to 200,000. The men behind
the scheme plan to charter the old
Westralia, which is being converted
into a sheep - carrier capable of lifting
30,000 lambs per sailing.
The lambs are expected to be used
for breeding - purposes in America, as
there is not a great market for Austra-
lian lamb or mutton as a foodstuff there.
No Merinos will be shipped. The scheme
now awaits an O.K. from U.S. quaran-
tine authorities.
• •
S.A. Premier Playford, opening the
fifth Australian Area conference of the
Commonwealth Parliamentary Associa-
tion in Adelaide last week, called for
closer co-operation between the States.
He instanced current co-operation be-
tween his own State and Victoria and
N.S.W. in using the waters of the Murray
and Darling, but suggested that there
could be more of the same sort of thing
on smaller matters of more local interest.
He suggested reciprocity between schools
and hospitals in districts near State
borders. At present the most notable
example of co-operation of this sort is
the practice of drinkers in border-towns
taking advantage of differences in hotel
closing-hours in adjoining States.

If Australia could attract tourists on a
scale approaching the number of Aussies
who go abroad each year tourism would
be a profitable industry. Last year,
according to the Commonwealth Statis-
tician, 58,888 Australians went abroad
for less than a year and 44,978 for more
than a year. Among short-term
travellers tourists outnumbered business-
men by three to one.

Victorian police-surgeon Dr. J. H.
Birrell has no doubts at all about drink
being the chief killer on the roads. He
attributes two-thirds of all road-deaths
to alcohol and says “Pious whingeing
will not reduce the road-toll. You can
lower it only by hitting alcohol for six.”
The bat he proposes should be used for
hitting the sixer is the American system
of uniform compulsory blood-tests.

South Africa’s new monetary unit is

Hire-purchase business in March was
below the level of the same month in

Expectations that the £35-million loan
might repeat the performance of the
February loan were realised ; the loan
was oversubscribed to the tune of £lsj
million. This means that the total loan-
raisings for the year ending June 30 will
be in excess of £2OO million, compared
with the Budget estimate of £ll5 million.
When the May-June “special loans” are
added the total won’t fall far short of
the figure agreed upon by the Loan
Council for State loan-expenditure.
As a result of this recovery the Com-
monwealth will be called upon to make
only a small contribution from revenue
to help-out with State works, instead of
the very considerable wad it has had to
find in recent years.
State Premiers are no doubt already
preparing their briefs for this month’s
Loan Council meeting, with demands for
greatly extended spending programmes
for 1959-60. In preparing his first
Budget Treasurer Holt has an oppor-
tunity Fadden looked for in vain. He’s
in a position to make himself popular.
He can choose between being popular
with the Premiers and being popular
with the taxpayers. The choice shouldn’t
be hard. There’s no case for habitually
subsidising loan-works out of revenue.

Roy Grounds, one of Melbourne’s most
experienced and unconventional archi-
tects, came up with a full, rounded
“Nonsense!’’ to a question in a Mel-
bourne TV-interview on what he thought
of Arthur Calwell’s (characteristically
extravagant) claim that Australians are
one of the worst-housed Western nations.
The question was put up by Denis
Warner/probably impishly.
Grounds’s experience is that Australian
building-standards are very high—too
high, in fact, when mortage-money costs
up to seven per cent; but it would be
preferable to lower the interest-ceiling
than that of the houses.^

“Stromlo”: Well-known in Queens-
land as a lay preacher, the Minister for
Primary Industries, Charles Adermann,
recently found it necessary to discuss the
progress of the wine-industry at the 100th
meeting of the Wine Board in Melbourne.
He showed some reserve, but thought it
was “all to the good” that the national
promotion-campaign was concentrated
on table : wines and was “undoubtedly
having an important effect on Aus-
tralian drinking habits.” He hoped that
the industry and the wine-drinkers would
get full value for the efforts being made
to create the demand, and referred to the
stability given to the production of
brandy by the introduction of the pre-
ferential rate of excise-duty.

South Australian industry should
benefit to the tune of several million in

building of Vacuum’s oil-refinery at
Hallett’s Cove, near Adelaide. Premier
Playford told a gathering of motor-

construction of the plant would come
from South Australian manufacturers.
This was endorsed by Vacuum’s
managing-director Angus Jones, who
told another Adelaide meeting that as
much of the equipment as possible would
be Australian-made. Jones said work
on the refinery would begin next year
and the plant would be in production
by 1962. It would cost £l6 million, and
altogether his company planned to in-
vest £33 million in Australia during

A proposed Sydney site for an under-
ground parking-station is the Queen
Victoria Building, which Lord Mayor
Jensen wants to demolish to provide
space for a civic square, the parking-
station to be built below it. He main-
tains that the loss in rents —the City
Council owns the Q.V.B. —would be
made-up in increased rates from nearby
properties whose values would be en-
hanced by having the civic square in
their midst.
Jensen is simply burgeoning with ideas
at the moment. His latest is an elevated
roadway above Parramatta Road, pro-
viding a four-lane expressway between
Sydney and Parramatta. What’s more,
he suggests that the job could be done
on the franchise-system, the operating-
company recouping itself by charging
a toll of about ss. a vehicle. That sounds
more like Pat Morton than a Labor man.

“Ex-ACT”: Australia has sought the
maximum freedom of communications by
sea and air whenever the international
law of the sea has been under considera-
tion, as a deliberate national choice in
the interests of Australian overseas traffic.
Emphasing this in a lecture in Adelaide,
Commonwealth Solicitor-General Bailey
pointed out that international law recog-
nised no right of innocent passage through
the air-space above territorial sea. There-
fore, any extension of territorial-sea
limits, for which Indonesia and other
countries were pressing, would curtail
the margin of deviation in air-travel.
This .would apply particularly in island-
dotted seas such as those around the
Indonesian archipelago. Bailey said
Soviet policy favored extension of terri-
torial-sea limits, presumably to ensure
maximum manceuvrability in neutral
waters for submarines in time of war,
to deny the use of the sea for testing
nuclear-weapons, and to turn small States
against the conception of “freedom of
the sea.”

Appointed Walter and Eliza Hall Fellow,
1921-22, Dr Albiston, by his research,
proved the presence of black-disease in

“Archaen”: Apsley Cherry-Garrard,
passed on in London at 73, was famous
for a journey he made during Scott’s
1910-13 Antarctic expedition. It was
hoped that partly-incubated eggs of the
Emperor penguin, which breeds during the
Polar winter, might throw light on the
evolution of feathers, so Cherry-Garrard,
with Dr. Wilson and Bowers, went off
to Cape Crozier to get some. In 1920
Cherry-Garrard published a book, The
Worst Journey in the World, describing
that trip. The three-man team ultimately
found three eggs containing embryos of


the penguin. Wilson and Bowers perished
with Scott, but Cherry-Garrard took the
eggs to the Natural History Museum at
South Kensington, after the survivors of
the expedition returned to London. In
his book he described how a senior
museum staff-man took them without a
word of thanks, told him he needn’t wait,
and began to discuss them with a
colleague. Cherry-Garrard sat for hours
waiting for the scientist to give him a
receipt for the eggs. Ensuing public
indignation brought a . directive that
museum-officials must be approachable
and courteous, however great their ton-
nage in the scientific world might be. Fhe
embryos were examined by Professor
Cossar Ewart of Edinburgh University,
who said: “The worst journey in the
world in the interests of science was not
made in vain.”

Leading Melbourne architect Bernard
Evans, who is a hot favorite for this year s

(2/23rd), winning the D.S.O. at El
Alamein, serving at Tobruk, Lae and
Finschafen and ending as brigadier, with
three “mentions.”
Evans designed and built West Aus-
tralia House in London and London
Court —a reproduction of an Elizabethan
street —in Perth. Since the war he has
built many of Melbourne's modern flats,
being a protagonist of the own-your-own
projects and among the first to point to

“Kune”: Few members of the clergy
could be as well equipped for down-to-

Alfred Herbert Edwards, who has been in
charge of the Robertson (N.S.W.)
C.-of-E. parish for the past three-and-a-
half years. Before ordination in 1929,
he'd been in turn bootmaker, rouseabout,
farm-teamster (“even won a few plough-
ing matches”), horsebreaker, ship’s stoker,
produce-storeman, cow-cocky, potato-
grower (“went broke at it”), country bus-
driver, and Sydney taxi-driver. He gave up
the cab to study for the ministry at Moore
College, Sydney. AH this experience has
helped him, both in and out of the pulpit,
to call a spade a spade. Apart from three
years’ mission work in S.A., most of his
ministry has been in N. S. W. South
Coast parishes—he was at Jamberoo for
12 years before going to Robertson.

ABORIGINALITIES
Dum must be one of the most versatile
fluids in the bush. On the Atherton
Tableland (N.Q.) timbercutters use it to
beat the intense cold on the rain-swept
sides of the jungle-covered mountains ;
on the coastal strip canecutters drink it
to beat the beat after slashing burnt cane
all day at around 105 deg. in the water-
bag.
When I was in the Gulf country, rum
was a standard remedy for colic in stock-
horses. A glass of it in a beer-bottle of
hot water was the general prescription.
It was also a specific for toothache in
areas where chemists and dentists were as
rare as snake-feathers. The aching molar
was plugged with cottonwool soaked in
rum. If the hollow in the tooth was too
small to plug, the spirit was rubbed into
the gum around the pain-seared area.
As a mosquito-deterrent it has long
been popular in the Queensland bush,
“Never mind the novelties — what's the latest on nuclear-research ?”
though to the true rum-fancier the idea
of putting it on the outside of one’s pelt
instead of the inside is horrifying. But
the real versatility of the stuff was brought
home to me on a long droving-trip. With
the going tough, we were finding it hard
to keep awake in the saddle, but the
occasional swig of o.p. did the trick.
When we finally did bed-down for the
night, the night-cap of i-diddle-dum was
a potent deadener.

“Laetitia”: In the Torres Straits
islands I met an Irish cousin of “Maitri’s”
brown, velvety suede leaf-insect
(B. 6/ 5 / ’59). The emerald-green wings
that draped him from head to tail carried
a network of veins which provided him
with a perfect camouflage among foliage ;
but they served him badly when he took
to dining on our mosquito-nets. Appar-
ently a nocturnal feeder, he made no
attempt to take wing when we discovered
him at daylight. Perhaps he was unaware
he was no longer protected by camouflage.

“Fuzzy Wuzzy”: Loyal and unblem-
ished service to the New Guinea Admini-
stration, for periods ranging from 25 to
47 years, by natives in varied occupations
has been recognised by the awarding of
14 Loyal Service Medals. One was given
to Reri Wolongkato, of Paligmete (Gas-
mata sub-district in New Britain), a
retired luluai who was appointed in the
early days of the Australian Administra-
tion, in succession to his father who had
been luluai of the village under the
Germans. He served continuously until
old age and declining health forced him
to retire. Records were lost during the
war. but it’s known that he has given
between 30 and 40 years of sterling
service. His village people are described
officially as loyal, industrious and pro-
gressive, largely because of his leadership.

“Miss M.”: “Wakka’s” boundary-
rider (B. 13/5/’59) may have been using
the very earliest method of butter-
making. The citizens of Imperial Rome
used butter, not as a food but as a
medicinal plaster—just as it is still applied
to bumps on childish foreheads —and are
thought to have learnt the process of
butter-making from conquered Middle
Eastern countries, where its discovery
resulted accidentally from the carrying
of milk in skin-bags on the backs of
donkeys, or perhaps camels, whose gait
would churn anything.
* * * *.
“Swelpme”: A group of Australian
aviculturists have been conducting experi-
ments to determine how far-reaching are
the effects of inbreeding or line-breeding
necessary to fix a color or strain. One
breeder mated a young hen Australian
cut-throat finch (so called from the vivid
red band around the throat) to her father,
the offspring back to the same sire, and
their progeny back again. The young
from the third inbreeding were perfectly
healthy and no smaller than bush-bred
cut-throats. Several other experimenters
have inbred budgerigars over many
generations. Their findings agree that
repeated close-relative matings can pro-
duce a percentage of runts and, the natural
inclination to nurse and pamper the
weaklings must be curbed ; they must be
ruthlessly destroyed. In other words, man
must copy Nature and allow only the
strong to survive. Provided this is
done, inbreeding can go on indefinitely
without deterioration of the species. The
wild sparrow confirms this. Descended
from a few pairs, he is brother or cousin
to every one of the millions of spags in
Australia, but I’ll warrant he’s as big
and tough and spirited as any of his
species in any part of the world.

“Sunray”: The regular carter was away
sick, but the baker’s horse knew the run,
and with the horse doing the head-work
and the baker consulting the notebook
there were no hitches until the neddy
pulled-up outside a shop on the way
home. The relief-man referred to the
book: not on the list. But the horse
wouldn't budge. For 10 minutes he stood
there, looking more and more offended.
Then he took-off with a rush that nearly
unseated the driver, and, ignoring all
traffic-regulations, bolted for home. The
0.-1.-C. horses wanted to know what was
wrong. The relief-man didn’t know, but
explained the circumstances. Then:
“You mean to say you brought him
home without buying him an ice-cream?
Solly always buys him one, every day,
on the way home. That’s what the poor
old blighter was waiting for. No wonder
he got annoyed!”

and they’re hawking for insects before
settling-down for the night. There’s also
no doubting that they’re all getting a

obviously following swarms of insects,

further proof, there’s a noticeable reduc-
tion in midges and mosquitoes while the
martins are around. As I write I can
see a good prospecting area for the birds

“Sebak”: No doubt “Phil Anthus” is
correct in stating that the cup-shaped
depression which makes a second-story on
the thornbill’s nest doesn’t appear to serve
any practical purpose at all (B. 13/5/’59),
but when I went to school it was harped-
upon as being the No. 1 example of
feathered ingenuity. - That top, our
teacher stressed, was a dummy nest
designed to trick cuckoos into depositing
their eggs in the wrong room, as it were.
Having since seen the guile with which
a male pallid-cuckoo will decoy a hen-
bird from her nest so that his mate can
dash in and do the dirty, I’m afraid that
one of ’em —either our teacher or the
thornbill —was singularly naive.

“X.N.0.”: Tell “The Irishman” (B.
8/4/’59) that official records, both
of the Witby Customs registration
(she was built at Witby) and of
the Admiralty, show Cook’s En-
deavour as a square - rigged three-
master and as a “bark” all of
which is quite in accord with ancient
custom. A “bark” was merely a small
ship, and had been so for over 100 years.
In fact, except for cutters and schooners
used for dispatch-carrying and offshore
scouting, etc., square-rigged three-masters
of various size and gun-power comprised
almost the entire R.N. Later, in the
1840’s, when the opium- and tea-trade
called for faster, handier vessels, rigs
were greatly improved and standardised
to give us the seven present well-defined
types. The barque now became a ship
of any size, square-rigged on all masts
but the aftermost one. The new type
was almost a reversion to Tudor days,
when the standard rig was three or four
masts with square sails on fore and main
masts and lateen (now become a spanker)
on the one or two aftermost masts. So
the Cooktown model is authentic in all
respects.

numerous and daring in some of Bris-

in thick lantana-scrub along the creeks.
They have endangered production-tests

research-farm at Rocklea, where 40 white
Leghorns were killed by the marauders

pairs, trapping birds quartered in single

“Pieter Nuyts”: “Archaen’s” claim
here that the aborigines seldom used
granite for axe-heads, because it was too

Maybe extra-hard axe-heads weren’t
needed in that quarter —some doubt
whether they made any of their own, and
a good case can be made for the theory
that most of the artifacts found there
came in trade from as far afield as the
Kimberleys and South Australia.

“Villefair”: I often wondered how our
old place, and the rest of the houses built
on wooden blocks, managed to remain
standing in a district which could show
more wnite-ants’ nests than heads of pop-

answer. A chook, escapee from the
fowiyard, paused to stickybeak at a fence-
post, then bogged-in with great relish.
A termites’ nest, provided the banquet,
and not one of the little destroyers sur-
vived. Now I recall that every house in
the district used to have a few nonde-
script fowls roaming around, and a good
poition of every day was spent in the
shade, or shelter, under the house.

nPHOSE characters in Douglas Lock-
wood’s Crocodiles and Other People
(R.P. 6/5/’59) who, in hospitality and
not hostility, cordially invited a stranger
to a fight, sent my memory back to a
day when two hard-riding horsemen
flagged the Western Mail to a stop some-
where on the claypan between Charleville
and Cunnamulla (Q.). The horsemen had
a short confab, with the guard and driver
of the train ; the four then walked back
along the permanent-way and spoke with
a passenger, who left the train and walked
with them to a level spot. Here a ding-
dong mill took place between the stranger
and one of the horsemen, the two rail-
waymen acting as pickers-up. After the
third knock-down the fighters shook
hands. The passenger, a seeming victor,
rejoined the train, while the vanquished
rode away with his mate. “Must have
been an old score that had to be settled,”
I suggested to the guard as he passed
my window. “Not a bit of it,” he replied,
“They were perfect strangers. The bloke
on the horse just wanted a fight and was
looking for somebody willing to oblige.”

They go in between his teeth, vanish

O perfect evil, evil without disguise!

Meeting the Mokolkols
By D. M. FIENBERG
IN a report to the United Nations the Administration of the Trust Territory of New Guinea
included the following note:—
“The Mokolkol people were visited by Mr. D. M. Fienberg, Assistant District Officer, and
Mr. C. Normoyle, Cadet Patrol Officer. . . . For more than a quarter of a century the Mokolkols
have been known to the. Administration as a small band of primitive nomads, apparently of
Gainings origin, living in the country at the foot of the Gazelle Peninsula. Administratively
they have enjoyed a notoriety disproportionate to their slight numerical importance, through
their long-standing habit of raiding outlying hamlets, wantonly butchering men, women and
children, and disappearing without trace. Before the war several patrols endeavored to get into
friendly contact with these people, but they were always met with hostility.’’
The patrol-party has captured three Mokolkols and brought them into Rabaul.
{Concluded)
IN May, 1951, Chris and I
were back at Baia prepar-
ing to patrol again into the
Mokolkol country. The
sequel is soon told.
In the early stages of their
stay in the Rabaul area the
captured men were as sus-
picious as wild animals, and
equally as inclined to mope.
Lamu remained at heart as he
had been for years—a primitive
killer. Much of his time at
Nonga was spent in collecting
pieces of shell and salt-
impregnated materials against
the time of return to the
beloved mountains. A marked
change in his attitude occurred
as the trawler nosed into Baia,
and he recognised the cloud-
topped ranges of his ancestral
domain. Even before the
anchor was down he had
approached me and, with a
rare display of cheerful anima-
tion, indicated several points
against the skyline. Finally,
with grave courtesy, he
requested an axe.
The older man, Malil, whom
the Bain i n g s interpreters
believed to be the Mokolkol
leader, had proved to be a
more adaptable character, not
lacking guile, with signs of a
sense of humor and consider-
able histrionic ability. After a
few weeks his attitude had
thawed to a diplomatic
joviality. He was keen to
return home, and readily
agreed that his people should
make friends with the Govern-
ment.
On the Mokolkols’ first visit
to the crowded Rabaul “bung”
—the native produce-market—
he had quickly detected the
element of awe in the immense
interest shown by the Tolais.
Surrounded by a respectful
throng, and excited by the
noise and the sight of the fabu-
lous wealth in food displayed,
he had suddenly embarked on
an impromptu little song-and-
dance act whose culminating
point was a liberal sampling of
whatever items took his fancy.
The vendors prudently declined
to press for payment, and he
finally staggered off beneath a
veritable mountain of fruit and
vegetables. He now proudly
sported that seal of official
recognition—a luluai’s cap.
The woman, Manu, whose
husband was still in the ranges,
had fulfilled her eaFly promise:.
She was definitely the brightest
and best-adapted of the adults,
had learnt some Melanesian
pidgin, and, in contrast to the
“I think that one's for the children's session .”
men, had overcome most of
her prejudices regarding new
foods.
There had been one mis-
fortune. Early in their Rabaul
sojourn her youngest boy had
been admitted to hospital with
dysentery. His condition was
not considered serious, but he
suddenly took a turn for the
worse and died. It was then
discovered that Manu, stub-
bornly fearful that he would
starve to death on a liquid
diet, had filled him with chunks
of half-cooked taro she had
smuggled into the hospital.
She wept bitterly for two days,
and then, with the stoicism of
her kind, appeared to forget
the child completely. The
other two lads thrived, quickly
learnt to prattle fluent
Melanesian pidgin, and became
exuberantly confident.
My decision to send the two
men off alone was greeted with
polite scepticism by the shrewd
Kombe sergeant of the new
constabulary detachment; old
Moite, who was with us once
more, vigorously opposed the
scheme-.
“These men are still wild
pigs,” he grumbled. “You’ll
never see them again.”
Against this was the attitude
of Manu, who had been
in each discussion.
She seemed quite confident that
her husband would come to
claim her, and had herself
suggested that she and the
children wait with us.
■W7E moved inland to our
former camp-site on the
Mavalu. There I gave Malil
and Lamu each an axe, what-
ever rations they wanted (they
took only a few taros), and
instructed them to be back,
with or without their friends,
within four days at the latest.
They slipped into the bush,
and we settled down to build
a rest-house and explore the
fishing - possibilities of the
Mavalu pools.
The sergeant, like most
Kombes an expert submarine
hunter, speared a few yellow-
finned fishes, new to me,
that lurked under ledges near
the bottom. These were rather
like cod in appearance, weighed
up to 41b., and the flesh was
good. His enthusiasm waned
a little after he mistakenly
speared a small, surly croco-
dile, and in the ensuing melee
narrowly escaped being nipped.
In a tributary stream I used
my carbine on a couple of
large fresh-water mullet as
they wriggled over the stones,
from one pool to the next.
These fish, weighing up to 21b.,
confidently embark on such
journeys, through water barely
4in. deep.
The fourth day passed with-
out sign of the Mokolkols.
Moite chewed betelnut and
jeered amiably ; Manu smiled,
suckled her baby, and shrugged
maddeningly. A day or two
means little to people who
know neither calendars nor
clocks. I waited another 24
-"hours, fruitlessly, and prepared
to move into Atar, which
would at least provide a base
for subsequent operations.
The following morning,
somewhat grim, we headed
inland. Heavy floods during
the last monsoon had left few
traces of ofir old track. A
distant thunderous explosion
that seemed to have originated
in the direction of Rabaul, fol-
lowed by a sharp earth-tremor,
added to our worries, and for
the first time I regretted not
having brought a radio. A
police runner was sent back
to the trawler, anchored in
Baia inlet. He caught up with
us again late in the afternoon,
with a reassuring message: it
was only volcanic Mt. Ulawun,
“the Father,” up to his age-
old tricks.
At daylight next day I sent
out scouts, and after breakfast
we proceeded to break-camp
leisurely. A sudden outbreak

LOANS OFFSET REVENUE-FALL
/'■'vn figures now available it
appears as though the fall
in Commonwealth revenue for
the financial year to date is
broadly consistent with 'the
Budget estimates, but that an
enthusiastic response to cash-
loan offerings has made a big
improvement in the forecast
cash position.
This would seem to mean
that the Budget surplus for
the year may be in the vicinity
of the estimated £24 million,
against an actual surplus of
£lO4 million in the preceding
term, and that the Common-
wealth’s bank-overdraft, as
represented by its Treasury-
bills lodged with the central
bank, wiil be only slightly
higher than it was at June 30,
1958, instead of increasing by
£llO million.
Just what thoughts such a
prospect will provoke in the
mind of the new Treasurer,
Harold Holt, preparing his first
Budget (Fadden’s last one was
brought down on -August 5,
1958), is anybody’s guess. And
that is just how the daily news-
papers are treating it—as an
open season for guessing.
Loan Success
Oversubscription of the recent
Commonwealth £35-million v
cash-loan by £154 million
means that loans offered during
this financial year have been
oversubscribed by £894 million.
The three 1958-59 loans
brought in £147.2 million,
special bonds £25 million, over-
seas loans £29.3 million, and
State raisings were £3 million.
The total of £2044 million is
only £54 million short of the
1958-59 State works - and -
housing loan figure of £2lO
million, which is £lO million
up on that for 1957-58.
In the 1958-59 Budget
estimates it was planned to
raise £ll5 million by ordinary
loans and to transfer £lO2
million from Commonwealth
Consolidated Revenue to meet
the State works-programmes
and to find £7 million for war-
service land-settlement.
At the same time it was
arranged to charge £7B million
of defence expediture to the
Loan Fund and meet it from
Treasury bills. This method
of financing defence expendi-
“May I approach you on a financial matter ?”
ture was a departure from that
practised in the previous years,
when all defence outgo was
debited to revenue.
Conversion Question
It was considered also that
redemptions of old loans
would call for £BO million —£35
million to be met from
Treasury-bill finance and £45
million from the sinking-fund.
(In the previous year all re-
demptions were covered by the
sinking-fund.)
Just how conversion fore-
casts have compared with
results is not clear, but in view
of the response to cash-borrow-
ings it is likely that conversions
have been greater than
expected, and the need for
redemption less.
The cash position should
therefore at least be better than
Budget forecasts to the extent
of loan-oversubscriptions, even
allowing for some possible
small shortfall in revenue com-
pared with estimates made in
August last year.
However, it is unlikely that
the actual revenue surplus of
£24 million that appeared to
have been budgeted for last
year (compared with a £lO4
million surplus for 1947-58)
will be much, if any, better
than forecast.
On the other hand, loan-
raisings in Australia and
abroad this year, as already
shown, total £2044 million,
compared with £ll7 million in
1957-58. But in 1957-58 there
was the Budget surplus of
£lO4 million, compared with
the estimated £24 million for
the current term, during which
loan expenditure is put at £lO
million higher.
The smaller indicated Budget
surplus, plus the increased loan
expenditure, for 1958-59, would
seem likely to be offset by the
increase in cash borrowings.
But that still leaves the
revenue surplus £BO million
down on the 1957-58 figure,
and the cash and Treasury-bill
position somewhere near the
same as it was at June 30,
1958.
Portfolio “Down Under”
/Commenting on a booklet
entitled Down Under,
privately circulated by “a lead-
ing firm of [London] stock-
brokers,” “The Times” of May
21 notes that it says the
capital-appreciation on Austral
lian equities over the last
decade has been substantial,
and the scope for further
appreciation remains consider-
able.
In spite of fluctuations in
wool prices and the difficulties
caused by droughts and State
rivalries, industrial develop-
ment has made rapid strides.
The booklet points out that
the rate of expansion in Aus-
tralia is comparable with that
in North America, and for the
investor seeking to diversify
his portfolio Australia offers
excellent investment oppor-
tunities.
Although yields are low,
they need not be a deterrent
to investment in Australia, for,
says the stockbroking firm,
they are a long way from
counting the growth possibili-
ties. To some extent, they are
influenced by the monetary
restrictions which confine the
Australian investor to his
domestic stocks. Moreover,
for investors in the United
Kingdom, United States and
Canada, who can obtain the
benefit of double-tax relief,
Australian yields do not com-
pare unfavorably with those
obtainable elsewhere.
An aspect of this London
report becoming familiar in
Australia is that the person
who comes off worst in invest-
ments on Australian Stock
Exchanges is the private
investor in Pitt Street or Collins
Street.
This is simply because of
taxation anomalies. Corporate
investors domiciled in Aus-
tralia don’t pay tax on divi-
dends received on their
company - share investments,
and though profits distributed
to their own shareholders are
taxable in the hands of these
shareholders, at least the profit
before distribution looks the
better for the tax-exemption,
Tax anomalies have the
effect of making it remunera-
tive for those receiving a tax
advantage to outbid, on the
Stock Exchange, those who
receive no such advantage.
Thus the ordinary personal

years, today the personal in-

incentive for buying.
Overseas Investment Here
Tnflow of overseas capital
into Australia in the current
financial year may reach £2OO
million, compared with £136
million in 1957-58, the Bank
of N.S.W. reports in its
quarterly review.
The article points out that
borrowing overseas by the
Commonwealth Government
accounts for a relatively small
proportion of the total amount
of overseas capital which has
been made available to Aus-
tralia in the post-war period.
Private investments had con-
tributed a much greater total
of funds, and had made a much
greater impact on the pro-
gramme of industrial develop-
ment.
The majority of private
capital investments in Aus-
tralia has been by overseas
companies establishing, or
supporting, a branch of their
organisation, or a subsidiary
company.
The bank says that portfolio
investment, or the purchase of
shares in Australian companies,
has increased considerably in
recent years.
While it amounted only to
£ll million in 1956-57, com-
pared with the total of £B7
million invested directly in
branch or subsidiary companies
in that year, there was evidence
that a greater number of over-
seas investors now realised the
potential growth-benefits of
Australian equity stocks.
It adds that Australians
should realise that investors
could not be compelled to risk
their funds in a foreign
country, and would not hesitate
to investigate alternative oppor-
tunities if Australia were to
seek to impose unreasonable
conditions on investment here.
“While any suggestion of a
compulsory minimum partici-
pation by local investors would
risk undoing much of the good-
will which has been built up
as a firm basis for future in-
vestment, the overseas investor
himself may gain distinct
advantages in a closer link
with Australian capital,” says
the bank.
U.K. Investment in Canada
Tt has been estimated by
Canadian authorities that
direct investments (apart from
portfolio investments) by U.K.
interests in Canada in 1945 (the
end of World War II) had
fallen to $348 million. By
1953 they had recovered to
$612 million, 1954 to $759
million, 1955 to $BB4 million,
1956 to $1024 million, 1957 to
$ll5O million, and 1958 to
$1250 million.
Among the foremost of the
post-war investors were
Hawker Siddeley, Rio Tinto,
British Petroleum and British
Aluminium, as well as already-
established offshoots of
U.K. international organisa-
tions (Shell, 1.C.1., etc.).
United States capital, of
course, has flowed into Canada
on an even greater scale, and
recently a London “Times”
correspondent in Canada com-
mented: —
What really concerns Canadians
is the amount of foreign capital
that has been needed to develop
the Canadian economy in recent
years. And foreign capital in this
context invariably means American.
The sudden realisation some three
years ago that in manufacturing,
mining and oil, foreign-controlled
companies accounted for more
than one half of the total capital
invested came as an unexpected
shock. In oil alone the figure was
70 per cent. To put the point
another way, it is estimated that
between 50 and 60 per cent, of all
company profits earned in Canada
accrue to firms controlled abroad.
Remittance of dividends to
foreign investors is, of course,
the sting in the tail of any
investment that comes into a
country. The General Motors-
Holden’s case has been dis-
cussed widely in Australia.
But unless we create capital
for ourselves through greater
productivity and saving we
must continue to import it in
order to expand.
Canadian Budget Outline
'yUiTH a Federal Budget due
in Canberra in August,
it is interesting to study the
Canadian Budget outline.
In Canberra (in the press-
gallery, anyway) some tax-
relief is expected. In Ottawa
there were some increases in
tax, but also an anticipated
reduction in the deficit, as well
as extensions of social services.
Presenting his Budget to the
House of Commons on April
9, Finance Minister Fleming
announced tax changes which
he said were based on two
. principles:
(a) To provide a broadly based
source of revenues to meet the new
and additional forms of universally
available social-welfare benefits;
and
(b) To reduce the Budgetary gap
in a degree that will not interfere
with the desired rate of recovery,
b'ut will hold out the prospect
of a balanced Budget at the appro-
priate time.
Expenditures for the fiscal
year 1959-60, excluding the
old-age pension fund, are
expected to be approximately
$5660 million, compared with
ss3B7 million in 1958-59.
Budgetary revenues, after tax
changes, are estimated at $5267
million, compared with $4770
million. The deficit is there-
fore expected to be approxi-
mately $393 million. This com-
pares with a deficit of $617
million in the past fiscal year.
Payments from the old-age
security fund for old-age pen-
sions are expected to amount
to $578 million, and revenues
are expected to amount to
$536 million, making a deficit
of $42 million in this sector.
Tax-increases, it is estimated,

For Three-year Holding
A lthough the return from
Kandos Cement shares at
60s. is only 3.3 p.c. on a 10
p.c. div. basis, in' this front-
rank stock there are definite
prospects of substantial in-
come-growth over the next
three years.
At the beginning of 1959
the new Geelong plant of Aus-
tralian Portland Cement Pty.,
in which Kandos has a half-
interest, started operating, lift-
ing capacity at Geelong to
500,000 tons a year.
This new plant was financed
out of retained profits.
A new unit is being added to
the Kandos (N.S.W.) set-up,
where capacity is already
200,000 tons a year. The
capacity of the new unit is not
disclosed, but it has been
described in terms similar to
the Geelong addition.
It would appear that the
Kandos additions will bring
capacity there to beyond
500,000 tons a year, and total
N.S.W. and Victorian capacity
of Australian Portland Cement
Pty. to above 1,000,000 tons
a year.
The additions at Kandos, ex-
pected to be completed by 1961,
will be financed out of “internal
resources.”
With the combined capitals
of Kandos Cement and Aus-
tralian Cement (which owns
the other half of A.P.C.) about
£2,825,000, it would appear
that each ton of plant-capacity
owned by the operating-co.
will be represented by £2 16s.
of holding-co. capital and a
potential annual turnover of
around £lO.
From every point of view it
seems a strong position.
Profits of the operating-co.
are not disclosed, nor are its
reserves ; but a concern which
has paid 10 p.c. p.a. to its
public shareholders while add-
ing so greatly to its plant
capacity without raising fresh
capital should eventually reach
the stage where its earnings
will show a steep increase at
a time when the drain on its
cash resources ceases.
That point, allowing for
maintenance of general con-
structional activity through-
out the Commonwealth, should
be reached by the 1961-62 term.

'""The success of the Monthly
Investment Plan, estab-
lished by a leading Brisbane
stockbroker last July, has en-
couraged the firm to enlarge
the “permitted list” to include
any company listed on the
Australian Stock Exchanges—
including the base metals, but
excluding all other mining
companies.
Melbourne brokers under
their scheme book whole
shares and fractions of shares
to clients so that the exact
amount of each monthly pay-
ment is fully invested. The
Brisbane firm has announced
that it is prepared to carry a
debit-balance in its accounts
and buy one whole share in
excess of the number that
would ordinarily be possible
with each client’s monthly pay-
ment.
The lead established by the
Brisbane firm, if followed by
southern brokers, could result
in some strong compet.tion for
the unit-trusts.
Patons and Baldwins
T>alancing on May 2 this
year, Patons and Baldwins
(Aust.), Ltd., took stock at
the lower of cost or replace-
ment value, and could do its
figuring under more favorable
conditions than in the preced-
ing year, when wool prices
were steadily on the way down.
Since Easter wool prices
have shown a 25 p.c. recovery,
and this means that little or no
market loss should have been
recorded on raw wool bought
over the past six months.
For the latest term profit is
shown at £376,918, up £169,399,
after tax of £254,300 (up
£118,300).
Allowing for the 5 p.c. cum.
prefs., net earnings to ord:
capital represented 22.6 p.c.,
against 8.1 p.c. in the preced-
ing year. The ord. div. was
restored to 8| p.c. compared
with last year’s 6 p.c.
Turnover fell both in volume
and value during the past term,
and directors attribute the
recovery in earnings to the
improvement in stcick-values.
Patons and Baldwins shares
have exceptionally strong asset-
backing.

Voltaire to Music
[From Herbert Holman]
The trouble with “Candide”
(Saville Theatre, London) is
threefold : it isn’t stageworthy ;
the illustrious names that have
gone to create it are at artistic
variance ; and a cardinal error
has been committed in trying
to decorate satire with the eye-
and ear-catching frills of show-
business.
Yet it is right out of the
ordinary and richly entertain-
ing, especially to the connois-
seur of musical styles. Possibly,
despite the critics’ harsh recep-
tion, it will fare better on
Shaftsbury Avenue than on
Broadway (where it ran for 73
performances), if only because
London has seen “West Side
Story” first.
Leonard Bernstein's score
unashamedly derivative,
without the exactness of
pastiche or the exaggeration
of burlesque —is witty and
cultivated. A chamber-
orchestra, entirely traditional
except for a harp (no ’phones
or ’sp.’els or saxes here) dis-
courses over all manner of
styles from Lully to Stravin-
sky, but still speaks in one
style—the composer’s. Especi-
ally memorable are the
(Richard) Straussian opulence
of the Paris salon, Cunegonde’s
aria, “Glitter and Be Gay,”
and the off-key astringencies of
the choruses.
This keen touch of satire un-
fortunately does not extend to
Bernstein’s collaborators. Lil-
lian Heilman’s book alternates
between preciosity and the
punched-out “blue” gags of the
pre-war musical comedy. The
lyrics, by Richard Wilbur,
John Latouche and Dorothy
Parker, are disparate and un-
matched to the music. And
Robert Lewis’s production,
though brisk and lively, is a
hotchpotch of ad hoc “busi-
ness,” ranging from D’Oyly-
Carte to Agnes be Mille. It is
intellectually inadequate.
Happily, the performers are
one with the composer. Denis
Quilley makes light of an exact-
ing part as Candide, who is as
much a prig as Sir Galahad
(another hero, incidentally,
destined for a tenor voice). The
American, Mary Costa, is
both deadpan and expressive—
the one in her comedy-acting
as Cunegonde ; the other in her
pure and agile voice. The aria
mentioned earlier rightly stops
the show. A girl for the
diamonds, she greets every suc-
cessive treasure from the jewel-
box with coloratura chuckles
in the best musical joke yet
heard.
Laurence Naismith doubles
the fatuous optimism of Dr.
Pangloss with the down-in-the-
mouth pessimism of Martin,
and, as a boisterous, fun-loving,
academician compere, binds
the dissimilar episodes to-
gether. Of the same quality
are Edith Coates’s life-tarnished
Old Lady and Ron Moody’s
laconic, philandering Governor.
The satirical aims the
plight of a young idealist in a
world past reform and the
showing-up of Rousseau’s
optimism and Leibnitz’s pessi-
mism—are realised only in part,
but the last scene of sudden and
utter disillusionment is not
without power. This effect is
lost, however, by the conven-
tional full ensemble.
The show won’t inspire
people to seek out the original
novel, but it may cause many
to buy the gramophone-record.
Cilli Wang
The cilliness of Cilli Wang,
at present convulsing crowds
at the Comedy, Melbourne,
reminded this observer of the
two Continental Clowns who
raised pantomimicry to a high
intellectual level when they
were operating with Wirth’s
Circus. Compared to the local
practitioners of the art they
were Old Masters. Miss Wang,
who comes from Vienna, is the
new master.
She succeeds in conveying all
the nuances of expression of an
abstract artist caught-up in the
frenzy of creating nothing out
of something; the pathos of
the suburbanite who gets-up in
the morning, goes to the office,
achieves nothing, starts for
home disconsolate and has all
the feelings of a knight-errant
when a pretty girl passes, can’t
do anything about it and gets
back into bed to dream about
the damsel; and, as a chamber-
maid, she practically makes
you see the glass of the window
she is cleaning.
Her dancing with various
self-made puppets is extraordi-
narily ingenious. Sometimes the
puppet looks more alive than
Cilli Wang does. In “The Two
Little Acrobats,” half of her
is one acrobat "and the other
half is his partner, and she
combines - their complicated
movements with something like
genius. “World Tournament
19 ?”, in which a Russian
and an American march-theme
try to overwhelm each other,
would serve as a biting com-
ment on the conference cur-
rently going on in Europe.
In her own simple way she
speaks a universal language
which makes Zulus laugh as
much as European literati.

Haebler and Malko
In a performance of
Mozart’s Concerto in D Major,
K. 537 (the “Coronation”), with
the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra under Nicolai
Malko, Viennese pianist Ingrid
Haebler revealed herself as a
sensitive and gifted artist.
Plenty of pianists have the
dexterity demanded by the
trills, runs and figurations of
this lovely work, yet fail to
penetrate below its surface
brilliance. Miss Haebler ex-
posed its mood-changes with
ease, gave a high polish to the
cadenza work, and with cool
and crisp command brought a
tone of ringing clarity alike to
the long melodic phrases and
the high-speed embellishments.
The predominant strings and
woodwinds in the reduced
orchestra were held by Malko
to an engaging balance with the
solo instrument.
The big work of the night
was the Brahms Symphony
No. 2, and this the conductor
drove along with resolute
force, yet always with a feel-
ing for its inherent pastoral
cheerfulness and, in the adagio,
utter serenity.
There was some impressive
playing— apart from the overall
excellence by individual
groups of instruments: the

Australian Youth Orchestra
Guided through a searching
programme by Sir Bernard
Heinze at Sydney Town Hall,
this orchestra, recruited from
the 15-25 age-group in all
States, showed that it has de-
veloped into an instrument of
some significance. It has sec-
tion-leaders of fine talent, and
it proved that it can handle
the biggest works with confi-
dence in a forthright and
disciplined reading of Beet-
hoven’s Fifth. The variations
on the four-note theme of the
first movement were shaped
with splendid precision, and
only in the more bustling
moments of the concluding
presto was there a falling-off
in tone and balance.
The orchestra showed the
best of its promise, however,
in Liadov’s “Enchanted Lake,”
an essay in tonal delicacy
finished with a tapering pianis-
simo that could have stood
comparison with any orchestra.
There was an attractive splash-
ing of gorgeous Oriental color
in the Polovtsian Dances from
“Prince Igor,” and Margaret
Sutherland’s “Dithyramb”
brought out some particularly
fine work from the woodwinds.
Geoffrey Michaels, the 14-
year-old violinist- from W.A.
who won last year’s A.B.C.
Concerto Competition, was
soloist in the Mendelssohn
Concerto. Commanding a
smooth technique and a good
tone extending right up into
the stratosphere, he gave it a
sound reading. He is now
making more confident
“entries” and matching himself
better against the orchestral
forces, which, at times in this
concert, were unfortunately
allowed too much weight.

A Double
The Huntington Players, a
competent roving repertory
company, came to rest with
a double bill at St. Phillip’s
Hall (Sydney) for four nights
last week. A tragic little one-
acter, “The Valiant,” was given
a restrained production by
Doug J. Glossop, and Denis
Leahy made credible the
muddled nobility of the youth
about to die for murder.
The company ,was not so
successful in Noel Coward’s
“Fallen Angels.” As director,
Patti Asange kept the action
moving along at a lively pace,
but in the part of Jane she
bounced the humor round in
too robust a manner. Judith
Aaron, as Julia, and Jean
Stark, as Saunders, worked
neatly enough, but everyone
was too much affected by the
boisterousness of the produc-
tion to catch the urbane
Coward mood.

From Brazil
Since Cacipore de Lamare
Torres has come, via Paris, all
the way from Brazil to the
Clune Galleries at King’s Cross
it seems a pity that he doesn’t
tell us something about Brazil:
the more so since his patch-
work abstracts, particularly
“Composition 11” and “Com-
position 18,” look like
landscapes that have slipped
over sideways and show a dis-
tinct yearning towards the
shapes and colors of deserts
and adobe walls. “Composi-
tion 17,” orange and brown
and blue, even looks (almost)
like a landscape the right way
up. As it is, with Brazil largely
dissolved in the familiar pat-
terns of Paris, the paintings say
pleasantly enough what their
limited formula permits
them to.
For Charity
The annual Watson’s Bay
exhibition at Anthony Hor-
derns’, Sydney, is for charity ;
and perhaps the best thing to
do about it, shutting one’s eyes
to the saccharine and the
superficial, is to say that here
and there a few good things do
exist: a group of three small
oils by Norman Lindsay, some
Murch beach-scenes, N land-
scapes by Miriam Moxham,
R. H. Moppett and Garrett
Kingsley, watercolors by G. K.
Townshend, Mol]ie Flaxman
and Albert N. Clarke.
There are also some inter-
esting bits and pieces from
the past, such as some Septi-
mus Power cows, a white sea
in moonlight by Tristram, and
a nice little streak of light
along a leaden ocean in an
unframed oil by Syd Long.

Jessie Traill, indefatigable

Melbourne Film Festival
Melbourne’s Film Festival,
distributed this year between the
Union Theatre, sundry other
theatres and the University of
Melbourne, is said to have be-
come an event of international
importance ; so it was a pity
that Australia was represented
only by documentaries (though
all of them seemed to get
Oscars).
They were very good docu-
mentaries, as documentaries go.
“The Edge of the Deep” told
you very beautifully about the
quaint habits of the migratory
birds which follow the sun
from the Arctic Circle to the
shores of Hobson’s Bay and
back ; another told you a lot
you didn’t know about the
Grampians and wildflowers;
another was a public-relations
film about spastic children;
and still another gave a
dramatic warning, in startling
and sometimes gruesome detail,
of the folly of not using the
safety-devices manufacturers
are compelled by law to pro-
vide for their workmen.

festival-opener Mr. Justice
Barry’s prognosis that if the
screen is to counter the
menace of television it must
turn to making films marked
by artistic sincerity (and, he
might have added, human
interest)?
These were provided in
plenty by the rest of the
enormous programme, which
ranged from Tierra del Fuego
to Kamchatka —100 films from
24 countries. Lack of space
forbids the mention of more
than one for the present, but,
as this one happens to be “The
Horse’s Mouth,” with Alec
Guinness as the immortal
Gulley Jimson, the rest don’t
need to be regretted.
Gulley Jimson is the proto-
type of the real artist, though
his pictures are awful. He
loves painting for its own sake,
and he is ready to sacrifice
wine, women, song, decency,
respectability and honor for
his obsession. He has an
image in his mind and he wants
to put it on canvas, and he will
lie, steal and go to jail in the
endeavor. He loves millionaires
—not for their money but be-
cause they can help him to
externalise his image — and
when he gets one as a patron,
and forces his way into his
ornate apartment, he paints a
mural on the wall and gets
kicked out.
It is a wildly funny film, and
a sad film as well. In the last
scene Jimson, drifting down
the Thames in his houseboat
seeking new horizons, passes
an enormous ocean-liner whose
sides are being scraped and
painted, and all he sees in it is
a golden opportunity for
another mural.

“Separate Tables”
The compassion and keen
perception of Delbert Mann’s
directing are seen at their best
in this beautifully-spun ver-
sion of Terence Rattigan’s play
about the emotional problems
of several off-season guests at
an English seaside private-
hotel. Rattigan’s scales of
human values are well balanced
•—there is always enough de-
cency and understanding to
counterbalance the frigid
snobberies, the intolerance and
meanness. Every character
and his motives are projected
with sharp clarity.
A distinguished s6t of por-
traits emerges. A surprise is
the depth achieved by David
Niven, who up till now has
specialised in easy flippancy,
as the phony major who finds
an anodyne for his painful
inferiority-complex in describ-
ing campaigns he took no part
in. His dumb hunger for com-
panionship and understand-
ing is subtly conveyed. De-
borah Kerr lends complete
conviction to the downtrodden,
colorless spinster who at last
rebels against her domineering
and viciously snobbish mother
(played splendidly by Gladys
Cooper) to show in her in-
coherent, gauche way the
kinship of her own and the
“major’s” frustrations.
Burt Lancaster draws with
strength and skill the American
lover of the serenely self-con-
trolled hotel-proprietress (an-
other richly satisfying perform-
ance from Wendy Hiller) who
is plagued by the return of his
ex-wife. And even Rita Hay-
worth, as the ex-wife, reaches
a depth or two.

“The Naked and the Dead”
Norman Mailer’s novel about
the battles and private lives of
a group of U.S. troops on a
Jap-held island in the Pacific
gives director'Raoul Walsh a
chance to spread himself in
some of the most impressive
battle-scenes on film. Also on
the credit side are some well-
limned Army humor and a
clash of wills between a
general who believes in com-
mand through fear and a
lieutenant-aide who flatly re-
jects the philosophy and is rele-
gated to a dangerous patrol-
job. The film is at its best in
this penetration by a small
squad deep into enemy-held
territory, but is marred by
some superfluous romantic
flashbacks and a tendency to
sentimentalise and speechify.
Raymond Massey is force-
ful as the ruthless, reactionary
general. As the aide who
finally proves that affection gets
better results than fear in deal-
ing with troops, Cliff Robert-
son uses a quiet, quizzical
manner to good effect.

“The Trap”
Action is brisk and tensions
fairly well held in this piece
about a snide lawyer who
double-crosses a gang-boss
and, grabbing him as he is
about to flee the country, has
to run the gauntlet of the big-
shot’s hired killers during a
journey with his captive across
some of California’s wildest
country. The climax, with a
car driven straight at a taxi-
ing plane to wreck it, is excit-
ing in its own incredible way.
Richard Widmark is the
shyster, and Lee Cobb exudes
his special brand of menace
as the cagey captive. Quite
unacceptable is the dash of
romance apparently added as
an afterthought an offbeat
love-affair between Widmark
and a former girl-friend who
married his worthless brother.

The WILD CAL
COLUMN
Moulded Products (A/asia), Ltd.
'T'he remarkable growth of the plastics-
moulding industry over the past
dozen years or more has led to the
planned or actual production in Aus-
tralia of many of the raw - material
requirements of the plastics-moulder.
In addition to the stream of new appli-
cations found for plastics and the
steadily increasing demand for some
established lines, the assured supply of
new materials, and of materials hitherto
in short or uncertain supply, will, no
doubt, provide further scope for the
expansion of the moulding industry—
even if the immediate outlook is for
expansion on a rather less spectacular
scale than that seen since World War 11.
The largest manufacturer of plastic
goods in Australia and a sizeable pro-
ducer of P.V.C. moulding-powder for
use by other manufacturers, Moulded
Products (Australasia), Ltd., has par-
ticipated to the full in the development
of the industry as a whole. At the same
time, the co. has come up with some
vigorous expansion on its own account
through the absorption of various rival
and allied concerns; the purchase of
W. F. Birch Pty. and Amalgamated
Plastics (A/asia), Ltd., being followed
in 1956 by a successful takeover-bid
for Pierwood Plastics, Ltd., of Sydney,
and the acquisition of outside share-
holders’ interests in Flexible Plastics Pty.
Since the beginning of this year the
co. has also acquired, through share-
exchanges, the paid capitals of Trigg
Palfrey Pty. (Melbourne), Industrial
Synthetics Pty. (Sydney), Stevens Plastics
Pty. (Sydney) and Westralian Plastics
Pty. (Perth), the activities of these new
subsidiaries ranging from blow-moulding
and extrusion to the manufacture of
plastic “biscuits” used in the production
of gramophone records.
Originally an offshoot of Dunlop
Rubber, Moulded Products was passed
over to private interests in 1936, the
public coming into the picture as share-
holders in 1939. Paid capital, £24,502
in 1939, had reached £264,348 by the
end of the 1949 term and, including
£408,125 in 64- p.c. prefs. and 300,540
ss. ords. issued in connection with
recently-completed takeovers, now totals
approximately £1,725,900. The only
bonus-issue as a public co. was in the form
of compensation to pref. shareholders
affected by adjustments to the rights and
div.-rates carried by pref. capital.
The largest of Moulded Products’
factories are centred around Melbourne,
the host of plastic and plastic-coated
goods turned-out by the group and
distributed by an Australia-wide sales
organisation—including agricultural and
industrial piping, containers of almost
numberless variety, insulated wires and
cables, vinyl-coated fabrics, polythene
film, floor-tiles and toys.
The most recent share-issue to mem-
bers was a one-for-two affair, at a
50 p.c. premium, in 1955, the exercise,
last term, of options (issued with 6 p.c.
notes in 1953) to take up 1,006,750 ss.
ords. at 7s. 6d. preceding an issue of
£745,358 of 7 p.c. 7s. 6d. notes. The
new notes are convertible into ords.,
at a 50 p.c. premium, in 1964, holders
enjoying the same rights as ord. share-
holders in the event of issues prior to
conversion.
Part of the proceeds of the note-issue
will be used to expand activities in the
insulated-cable field, in which the group
trades through the wholly-owmed A.P.I.
Cables and Insulation Pty., the balance
facilitating the repayment, due this
month, of £187,269 of 6 p.c. note-money
and the consolidation of the other manu-
facturing interests.
Rising by 20 p.c. in the 1956
term, the turnover of the well-handled
group has grown at a slower rate over
the last couple of years, a 64 p.c. in-
crease being reported for the year to
December 31 last. With operating costs
held at “satisfactory levels,” earnings
before tax and depreciation advanced
by £61.907 to £824,623, of which a
generous £296,877 (up £40,099) was
provided for depreciation ; the tax pro-
vision. up £10,571 at £194,860 being
roughly in line with £327,878 claimed
as net profit:

* After eliminating outside shareholders’ interests.
Up £11,237 on the previous term’s
showing, the earnings covered the pref.
div. and a jot under 27 p.c. on the
higher average ord. capital, compared
with 29.9, 26, 36.7 and 27.7 p.c. over
the four years back to 1954. Steady
at 14 p.c., for the ninth consecutive year,
the ord. div.-rate called for less than
52 p.c. of equity earnings, undistributed
profits, share-premiums (arising from the
exercise of options) and sundry adjust-
ments adding a healthy £265,459 to
reserves.
Ord. capital has risen by almost 150
p.c. since 1954, the use of fixed-interest
and convertible-note money, as well as
the heavy premiums carried by new
issues contributing to the attractive
earning-rate. Finances were in good trim
at balance-date with current liabilities
adding-up to only 7s. 2d. for every £
of current assets which, in turn, exceeded
all outside liabilities by £574,904. Final
payment on the convertible notes has
brought in £372,679 in the current
year;—

Extensions to plant and buildings at
the big Mentone (Melb.) works and
construction of a new warehouse-show-
room in Adelaide were completed during
the term, the gross capital-outlay
running-out at around £600,000, with the
book-value (cost, less depreciation) of
fixed assets rising by £399,472. A rela-
tively small (£75,312) increase in stocks
was accompanied by a big jump in book-
debts, trade debtors accounting for
£147,092 of the extra £214,113 shown
against this heading.
The combination of solid reserves
(including £475,882 of share-premiums),
a high earning-rate and obvious growth-
potential should benefit shareholders,
one way or another, within the next few
years, but, in the scramble for first-class
equity scrip of this kind, the share-
market appears to have left little room
for the latecomer. At last week’s price
of 225., the ss. ords. would return no
more than £3 3s. Bd. p.c. from a con-
tinued 14 p.c. div., the earnings-yield
(last term’s average capital at market-
value) working-out at a modest 6.1 p.c.
At December 31 last there was a con-
servatively-reckoned 11s. in net tangibles
for every ss. ord. issued at that date.

Younghusband, Ltd.
A robust septuagenarian, Young-
husband, Ltd., came through last
term’s slump in wool prices showing little
sign of strain, and in a confident end-of-
term gesture restored the div.-rate to
10 p.c., dividing the whole of its net
earnings amongst shareholders and
various staff funds.
Woolbroker, stock-and-station agent,
merchant and pastoral-financier, Young-
husband, Ltd., finds the greater part of
its business in the favored pastoral areas
of Victoria and southern N.S.W., operat-
ing as a selling-broker at the Melbourne
and Albury wool-sales.
The Melbourne-based co. is supported
by a Sydney office and 52 branches, of
which 13 have been established within
the last 10 years, £845,000 of fresh share-
capital together with £95,000 of share-
premiums being gathered-in since 1949
to finance the brisk, all-round expansion
achieved during this period. A one-for-
five par issue in 1957 lifted paid capital
(all in ords.) to its present total of
£1,470,000.
Occurring at the end of the co.’s
accounting period, the sudden and heart-
ening improvement in wool prices, along
with a big increase in the volume of
wool sold, pushed proceeds from last
April’s woohsales £lB.B million above
those of the April, ’5B, sales. But, while
it seems almost certain that the coming
season will open on a strong note, the
fall in the wool-cheque for the first 10
months of the current financial year is
still a rather sombre £60.7 million:

1959 .. 3,900,662 237,825,133 60 19s. sd.
New connections as well as improved
seasonal conditions led to an increase
of 7568 bales (to 138,322 bales) in
Younghusband’s receipts of wool last
term, a drop in sales (126,103 bales,
down 14,014 bales) and the higher carry-
forward (26,407 bales, up 12,219 bales)
being influenced to some extent by the
co.’s balance-date (March 31) falling
within the sales^roster.
“Seriously affected” over the first half
of the term by a falling wool market,
lower stock-values and a slackening in
rural spending, gross earnings picked-up
over the latter half of the year, but, at
£1,156,261, failed by £24,326 to reach the
level of the preceding term. However,
a determined assault on operating-costs
produced particularly pleasing results,
management expenses falling by £23,161
(to £864,961); a little-changed £41,077 for
depreciation and a lighter tax-provision
(down £6OOO at £84,000) leaving net
profit, as claimed by the co., £257\
stronger at £171,853. Regarded as an
appropriation of profit in the accounts,
£29,000 (up £7000) was added to staff
provident-funds during the year, the
treatment of transfers to staff-funds as
a charge against earnings giving a net
profit of £142,853, or £6743 less than the
1958 showing: : —

Back at 10 p.c., after dropping to'
9 p.c. in 1958, the div.-rate called for
£4147 more than the lower profit figure,
the £142,853 equalling 9.7 p.c. on the
all-ord. share-capital, compared with
10.1 p.c. in the previous term and 12.3,
11.8 and 13.7 p.c. on the smaller average
capital employed over the three years
back to 1955. The 10 p.c. div.-rate
brought the average rate for the past 10
years to 10.4 p.c.
“Having regard to the requirements
of the new (Victorian) Companies Act,”
the board presented the accounts in a
slightly different form last term, a
“revision” of accounting - procedures
throwing up £48,042 of previously
unclaimed profits, while overprovisions
for tax (£20,352) and unexplained addi-
tions to reserves took the year’s net
addition to shareholders’ funds to a tidy,
£96,961.
Following the severe (£852,562) decline
in the previous term, flowing from
drought conditions and tumbling wool-
prices, the amount owing to clients and
trade creditors slipped by a further
£70,835, the co. drawing on cash hold-
ings (down £259,450) to supplement
sagging rural incomes with an extra
£250,019 of advances. These moves don’t
appear to have strained finances unduly
or exhausted the co.’s lending-capacity:

There has been no revaluation of fixed
assets, disclosed reserves of £713,432
providing a solid prop for share-capital.
The principal areas served by Young-
husband have, so far, experienced favor-
able weather conditions this year and,
with the promise of higher average wool-
values next season, the co.’s immediate
prospects are encouraging. On current
market-values the £1 ords. don’t appear
to be overpriced at 305., a 10 p.c. div.
giving buyers at that price a return of
£6 13s. 4d. p.c. Book-values at March
31 last show a net tangible cover for the
scrip of 295. Bd.
Western Stores, Ltd.
As a retailer trading exclusively in
country centres, Western Stores,
Ltd., is another concern to have put up
a quite creditable performance last term
in the face of tighter trading conditions.
Formed as Western Stores and Edgleys,
Ltd., in 1928, to amalgamate the interests
of three old-established storekeepers
operating in the central-west of N.S.W.,
Western Stores has expanded rapidly and
successfully over the last decade, the
extension and modernisation of existing
branch-premises being backed-up by
expansion on the growth-by-absorption
principle.
Branches are now established in the
N.S.W. centres of Dubbo,' Bathurst,
Orange, Wellington, Narromine, Gil-
gandra, Cowra, Grenfell, Molong, Tam-
worth and Tweed Heads, the chain
stretching to last-named town last March,
with the purchase, at a cost of 85,000 £1
ords., of department-store retailer and
chemist, Morleys Pty.
Although share-issues have also made
up part of the consideration in earlier
absorptions, shareholders have twice been
asked for fresh capital within the last
five years, new scrip being offered, one-
for-five at par, towards the end of 1954
and again in May 1956. Ord. capital
reached £1,300,390 in the current term,
on completion of the Tweed Heads deal,
£175,000 in 6 p.c. prefs. bringing the
total on the share-register up to
£1,475,390.
Steady at 124 p.c. for the last four
years, the ord. div.-rate has averaged
134 p.c. over the past decade, with the
actual return to shareholders well fattened
by bonus-issues in 1951 (two-for-five) and
1954 (one-for-two). The gift-issues were
financed by revaluation of freeholds.
Despite increasing competition from
Sydney-based rivals, both turnover and
earnings climbed to record heights in the
1958 term, the modernisation of premises
and the introduction of self-service food-
departments helping to swell the volume
of business and customer traffic. Contrary
to the popular trend, Western Stores has
not sought to attract business by offering
extended credit, the emphasis in recent
years moving towards cash and short-
term credit sales.
Cash sales continued to increase last
term (to February 28), accounting for
over 50 p.c. of all sales, but a slip in
credit transactions reduced ’overall turn-
over by a little ipore than 2 p.c., the board

blaming this drop on the

wool prices. Higher expenses
and, possibly, slimmer gross-

Timor Oil, Ltd.
TAirectors of Timor Oil,
Ltd., have announced a
par issue of 1,062,500 ss. ords.
(one-for-four) to shareholders
on the books on June 19.
In one of the areas tested
in Timor, seven diamond-drill
holes are all reported to
have pierced oikbearing sedi-
ments. A seepage pit, checked
for 90 days, averaged 528 gals.
of high-grade oil per day, and,
in view of these showings,
the co.’s American partners,
Tradewinds Exploration Inc.,
will drill 15,000 ft. of well-hole
at no cost to Timor. It is ex-
pected that the first well will
be spudded-in during July.
The new capital will, in the
directors’ opinion, be sufficient
to carry on diamond-drilling
and other geological explora-
tion work over the rest of the
extensive concession for a
period of from 18 months to
two years.
Enterprise of New Guinea
and gold-prospector,
Enterprise of New Guinea
Gold and Petroleum Develop-
ment, N.L., has been informed
that an application for exten-
sion of its oil-lease jn the Sepik
River area of New Guinea, has
been refused. The co. has
now lodged an application for
a permit relating to an area
of approximately 3600 square-
miles, north of its previous
area, along the Dutch border
to the sea, covering the field
Bewain-Pual depression near
Aitape and Vanimo.
The co. is at present develop-
ing a gold prospect at Edie
Creek, N.G., which at this
stage would appear to offer
shareholders their most likely
chance of collecting their first

MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
nPHE decision to build an oil-
refinery takes N.Z. past an
important milestone on the
road to industrial maturity.
The refinery will have an
initial capacity of two-million
tons , a year, and will supply
more than 90 per cent, of
N.Z.’s total petroleum require-
ments.
There will be a saving of
some £3,000,000 in overseas
exchange, and employment will
be provided for between 300
and 400 men, mainly techni-
cians and other skilled workers.
Imported crude-oil will be
processed, but if oil of suitable
quality is found in N.Z., this
will be used. _
In making the announce-
ment, the Prime Minister, Mr.
Nash, said that prices would
be at least as low as those of
comparable imported products.
The decision to build the
refinery is the outcome of
negotiations between the Gov-
ernment and the Shell group,
which is to construct and
operate the plant within three
years of a suitable site becom-
ing available. Shell hopes that
the refinefy will be in opera-
tion not later than 1964.
The N.Z. public will be in-
vited to subscribe up to £8
million of the £2O-million
capital required including
working-capital and the
remaining £l2 million will be
found by the Shell group.
The public’s participation
will initially be by way of
the holders of
which will have the option to
convert part of their holdings
into equity capital at specified
times during the three years
after the refinery comes “on
stream.”
Effect on Money-market
It is many years since a
large capital-issue was made
for industrial purposes in
N.Z. The mopping-up of
£8 million of investment funds
could have a material effect on
the rest of the market.
The refinery will operate
initially on “enriched crude”
—crude-oil which has been
enriched with feedstocks. This
will permit the production of
the very high proportion of
motor-spirit which the N.Z.
market requires without throw-
ing-up burdensome surpluses
of other products.
The refinery will supply more
than 90 per cent, of N.Z.'s
total petroleum requirements,
including all motor-spirit, gas-
oil diesel fuel, fuel-oil and
bitumen.
Some products, such as
aviation gasoline, lubricating-
oils, kerosenes and petro-
chemicals will not be within
the scope of the refinery until
the market for them grows.
As N.Z.'s trade will justify
economically the construction
of only one refinery, those com-
panies at present supplying the
N.Z. market will have access
to the refinery output.
Iron and Steel
Argument is still going on
about the proposal to establish
an iron-and-steel industry in
N.Z., and some heat has been
generated.
Several organisations want
to start the industry, but the
Government feels that its
feasibility is not yet proved.
A wrongly-based iron-and-
steel industry could be damag-
ing to N.Z., the Minister of
Industries and Commerce, Mr.
Holloway, said recently.
Any such industry would
have to be a monopoly. There
was no room in the country for
two iron-and-steel industries,
and no room for exports when
world production was increas-
ing. The N.Z. industry would
have to be based on N.Z.’s own
requirements, he said.
The Government did net
consider it had a right to com-
mit the nation’s assets before
it knew what was involved.
A substantial amount of
overseas capital would be
required, and before it would
be forthcoming overseas in-
terests would have to be
assured of Government sym-
pathy and support.
Mr. Holloway outlined the
Government’s proposals.
A limited-liability company,
for investigation only, would
be formed with the Govern-
ment holding 51 per cent, of
the shares.
That shareholding would take
the form of the work which
could best be done by Govern-'
ment agencies in the investiga-
tion programme, it was esti-
“ You’ll have to pull it down, Hans. The Old Australians cant
stand the draught .”
mated that this would be more
than half the total cost.
The desire to hold 51 per
cent, of the shares was to pro-
tect the overall interest of
N.Z. and to make sure that the
Government was in control of
the final solution.
The directors of the inves-
tigating company would be
representatives of all major
participants in the industry.
If this was not possible because
of numbers, private directors
would be elected by private
shareholders.
The Government believed
that those who wished to
participate in the investigat-
ing company should have first
right to participate in the
operating company, and that
those who wished to partici-
pate in the operating company
should participate in the in-
vestigating company.
The total cost of investiga-
tions is estimated to be between
£200,000 and £250,000.
Buoyant Sharemarket
The N.Z. sharemarket is
buoyant. Demand- has recently
spread out to embrace a wide
range of shares which had been
comparatively neglected for a
considerable time.
For this there are two main,
overlapping reasons: Restora-
tion of confidence and a search
for higher income-yields.
Under last year’s adverse and
unsettled conditions investors
decided to play safe. Thev
concentrated on the shares of
old-established companies with
a solid record behind them.
They did not want shares
which seemed to hold an ele-
ment of risk.
This cautious attitude has
been more-or-less maintained,
but is gradually being modified
as investors become more
optimistic about the future.
They have been influenced
by the continued improvement
in wool values and the sub-
stantial rise in dairy-produce
prices.
Another bull point was the
Hamilton by-election result.
There is a widespread feeling
that the Government will heed
the elector’s rebuke, and that
it will not be long before it
eases some of its more repres-
sive measures in an effort to
regain popularity before the
next election.
As confidence rises, then,
investors are reconsidering
some of the lesser-known
shares. These have become
relatively more attractive as
yields from the limited number
of popular issues have been
forced down by recent con-
centrated buying.

London Airmail
From Herbert Holman
CTnce the voting in local elec-
tions is notoriously unreli-
able as a sample of the general
trend, press comments on the
recent marked Conservative
recovery are anything but
unanimous. “Manchester
Guardian” rated the Tories as
favorites —but only just—and
considers that “the political
pattern remains surprisingly
uniform throughout t h e
country, with neither party at
a clear advantage.”
While expressing the inten-
tion not to discuss the results
in relation to the general elec-
tion, “Daily Mail” devoted a
column to the Conservative
victory, their growing strength
and the decay of Labor
fortunes. “Financial Times”
was lfess reserved, making out
that the results suggest that
“the Government would in fact
have won a general election if
one had been held in May, and
that its majority would have
been sufficient at least to last
a full term.”
“Daily Telegraph” wrote-
down the gains with this com-
ment : “All that it [voting] in-
dicates, in broad terms, is that
Conservatives have rather more
than regained the places which
they lost on local councils in
1956,” but endorses Mr. Mac-
millan’s own comment on the
results as “a healthy trend.”
This last caution is under-
standable, since the “Daily
Telegraph” is committed to
supporting the Government
and, no doubt, is anxious not
to encourage apathy or com-
placence. But the fact remains
that the Tories have nothing
much to worry about, aside
from the normal occupational
hazards of political life. Labor
has a great deal to worry about,
from a blow to its prestige as
serious as losing the red-flag-
flying borough of St. Pancras
to the weary outdatedness of
its battle-slogans.
Two broad conclusions must
be very comforting to the Con-
servatives. The first is that they
have regained the seats they
lost in 1956—that most disturb-
ing period of revolt, culminat-
ing in the loss of Tonbridge at
a Parliamentary by-election,
when true-blues vented their
disapproval by ostentatiously
abstaining from voting. The
second is more important still,
for the figures show that the
pockets of local unemployment
which followed the credit-
squeeze have not apparently
induced a pronounced swing
away from the Right.
In politics, of course, some-
thing devastating could happen
overnight which might, or
might not, be outside the
Government’s control. So long
as political life is subject to
such a vicissitude, the electoral
fortunes, of the parties must
needs remain delicately balanc-
ed. It is, perhaps, a measure of
Mr. Macmillan’s confidence in
the future that he has refused
to be panicked into a spring
general election, and a healthy
sign* that he has no need to
be concerned about the pre-
cise timing of it.
Mainly Imported
Most of the precision
cameras on demonstration at
the Photo Fair (Olympia) came
from Germany, although Aus-
tria has developed a valuable
post-war industry in quality
cine-equipment. The U.K.
market is, naturally, a con-
siderable one, with some 12-
million camera-users taking
300-million snapshots a year, of
which one in five is in color.
It would appear that the
decision of British manufac-
turers not to compete in the
higher-priced field was taken
deliberately, perhaps because
of the need for highly-skilled
precision craftsmen in the
electronics-industry. Another
factor is, no doubt, the revenue
from Customs-duty, for im-
ported photographic equipment
is heavily taxed.
Broadly, Germany~-and Aus-
tria supply the cameras,
Holland the lamps, while
Britain manufactures a large
quantity of miscellaneous
equipment such as projectors,
screens, films and papers. The
pattern, in fact, is that of the
Common Market' and the
arrangement appears to be
much more sensible than each
country competing with the
next on the same lines.
Britain's share of the in-
dustry is by no means in-
significant. Ilford have recently
become associated with 1.C.1.
in a very big project. More-
over the production of mass-
produced equipment is on a
vast scale. The talk of the
Fair is a new Pathescope
color-camera (cine and still) at
17 guineas, with a hand-driven
projector at 11 guineas. A
contract worth at least
£1,500,000 has been secured
with the United States, and this
in face of Japanese competi-
tion.
Incidentally, the Japanese
precision cameras on show are
superb in workmanship and
comparatively cheap. It would
be unrealistic to pass them off
as good copies, for they
present many ingenious and
original developments.
The Hanimex organisation,
too, is flourishing. Not yet
into its third year, most of its
products are oversold. The
Sekonic light-meter at
£4 12s. 6d., is the cheapest on
the market and the first month’s
shipment of the 200-watt pro-
jector (the first on the English
market) was taken up in one
day. This news should be par-
ticularly encouraging to those
who are opening new factories,
for it appears that a clean start,
with the latest methods and
machinery, can very quickly
pay off.
Only one of the Hanimex
staff of 40 is Australian, but
Australia House supplies the
travelling demonstrators. These
girls, states a director, are
always in demand for their
agreeable and well-bred per-
sonalities. Mr. Pringle, please
note!
Murder Most Fair
The nineteenth century, for
all its great actors, was a dreary
one in the English theatre.
Between “School for
Scandal” Mil) and “The Im-
portance of Being Earnest”
little has survived, even for
honorable mention, in the
history-books. A line of poets
from Coleridge, to Matthew
Arnold tried their hands, but
failed to impact. Shakspeare’s
dominance was then, as now,
unassailable.
One wonders, though, what
Shelley might not have achiev-
ed as a dramatist had he sur-
vived his sailing accident.
Certainly, there are many
works in the classical repertory
inferior to “The Cenci,” which
is now in revival at the Old
Vic.
A manuscript copied from
the Archives of the Cenci
Palace at Rome was Shelley’s
Holinshed, and his straight-
forward, if flat-footed, con-
struction, with plenty of action,
evidences his approach as
dramatist, not as poet.
Although the dialogue is in-
sistently and uniformly
“literary,” the characters are
so eminently actable that the
play’s neglect by producers
seems a mystery.
The reason is a simple one—
censorship. Count Cenci, a
life-long debauchee, conceived
an implacable hatred towards
his children, which culminated
in an incestuous passion to-
wards his daughter Beatrice.
This led to a family conspiracy
to murder him. With no less
ingenuity than other, later,
dramatists have used to circum-
vent the Lord Chamberlain’s
edicts, Shelley hinted at this un-
mentionable crime, skated
round it, and yet contrived to
make it the central issue.
Beatrice is a heroine of epic
stature. She, with her step-
mother and brothers, are hope-
lessly subdued and wronged by
this loathsome but powerful
man. And he, though of an un-
relieved melodramatic evil, has
a symbolic force as the epitome
of a corrupt and degenerate
society, headed by the church
which, as if in pitiless revenge,
tortures and executes his
family.
The influence of Shakspeare
is a little unfortunate. Echoes
of “Macbeth” pervade. But
this is not all. Like Desde-
mona, Beatrice must sing be-
fore she dies ; and even more
embarrassing is the Polonius-
like homily she delivers to her
young brother before mounting
the block.
Michael Benthall's produc-
tion is deceptive in so far as
it makes the play seem much
greater than the written word
alone would suggest. His
balance is superb, especially
in the way the grisly events are
softened by a background of
piety and gentleness. The act-
ing, too, is more than usually
dedicated. Hugh Griffith, by a
hint of mental sickness, makes
Cenci's villainy credible, and
Barbara Jefford touches the
heart in her big scenes, even to
a likeness of Ellen Terry ; her
performance might well rank
with that of the great tragedi-
ennes if her voice were more
musical and her diction less
stolid.


Rhino Ground
By
CLIVE BARRY
IN the remote heights of
Tanganyika there is a
coffee estate. This coffee
estate means a rich low
house, about five vehicles, a
badminton-court, a rockery,
a swimpool, 400 acres of
coffee-trees and a small army
of house and agricultural
servants.
Mr. and Mrs. van Stopele
live together in the remote,
rich, low house and they
manage the coffee estate.
Their chief house-servant is a
half-Arab, half-German named
Hando.
. This last long dry spell I
had to fly up to that coffee
estate to help Mr. van Stopele
straighten out his account-
books. Not unexpectedly I
discovered that Mr. and Mrs.
van Stopele found each other’s
company increasingly' tedious.
Hando performed his duties
with Oriental inscrutability
and Teutonic phlegm.
At the lunch-table the four
of us assembled in an atmo-
sphere of mutual dislike.
Hando served the food, Mr.
van Stopele ate with voracious
audibility, Mrs. van Stopele
soon escaped from the dining-
room into the dayroom and I
quickly followed her in the
hope of getting beyond ear-
shot of Mr. van Stopele's eat-
ing.
In the dayroom an English
Spode coffee - service was
arrayed ready on a tray on
an Egyptian pouff. Mrs. van
Stopele sat on , the divan
against the wall and organised
that coffee-service.
“Men are always chasing
me,” she complained to me as
she poured coffee into three
Spode cups. “Milk?”
“You are attractive,” I told
her, taking a seat on a leopard-
skin-covered armchair. “No
milk.”
YX/hile I looked up at the
wall - decorations behind
Mrs. van Stopele I was some-
what astonished to see her
conjure a small paper sachet
from a pocket inside the sleeve
of her brocade housegown.
I tried not to stare as she
swiftly put one or two heavy
shakes of powder from that
paper sachet into one of the
"It was rather like embracing
a wire cage crammed with ear-
splitting parrots.”
Spode cups. She threw the
empty sachet now into the
hearth and the old fire revived
momentarily.
A Chopin mazurka tinkled
on the hi-fi, softly, as though
filtered through from another
century.
“Every white man on this
mountain has tried to make
love to me,” she told me.
“Sure,” I said.
The wall behind Mrs. van
Stopele was decorated with
bows, arrows, guns, rhino-
horns and a moulded brass
chameleon. At least that
chameleon looked like moulded
brass, but I soon found that
it was only imitation moulded
brass. The feral sounds of
Mr. van Stopele eating lunch
filtered through that decorated
wall from (the dining-room.
“You ought to consider
yourself lucky,” she added,
handing me a milk-coffee
without the powder.
“Yairs,” I agreed, examin-
ing my cup to ensure that no
powder had got into my
coffee.
I could hear Hando gather-
ing in crockery in the dining-
room and a long draught of
Tusker beer by Mr. van
Stopele. On the divan before
me, Mrs. van Stopele selected
a coffee for herself. She left
the powdered coffee for Mr.
van Stopele. She put her own
coffee- on the armrest of her
divan. She left her arm lying
along that armrest with studied
negligence: Lulu the Lion
Girl in regal repose.
When that chameleon’s
eyesockets protruded and
swivelled I almost leapt up-
right with shock. By mobilis-
ing all my voluntary muscles
I managed to remain seated.
I could see now that chameleon
was not moulded brass at all.
And it was clinging to the
wall not 15in. from Mrs. van
Stopeie’s soft, shapely arm.
To avoid possible hysteria
I didn’t tell Mrs. van Stopele
of the chameleon’s proximity,
but I wondered to myself how
to break up the situation with-
out her knowing of it.
Meanwhile in the dining-
room those luncheon sound-
etfects ceased while Mr. van
Stopele growled instructions
to Hando. He said something
about a gun.
“They say Australian men
are magnificent lovers,” said
Mrs. van Stopele to me.
“Too right,” I said
worriedly.
Mr. van Stopeie’s enthu-
siastic mastication began
again as Hando came through
into our dayroom from the
dining-room. As usual his face
was expressionless. He took
down the anti-tank rifle from
the decorated wall and the

chameleon gave him a flicker-
ing glance. Hando rubbed that
rifle with a cleaning-rag.
“Men are' just reptiles,”
Mrs. van Stopele told trie as
her husband choked on a
swallow.
“My word,” I said.
Just then Mr. van Stopele
left his lunch-table. His resi-
dual chewing got louder but
his footsteps got softer as he
came from buffed cedar
parquet onto the Persian
weave of our dayroom. That
chameleon gave him a pro-
truded swivelled flicker too.
“Is that all you have to
say?” she inquired a trifle
sharply.
“It is time for your nap,
Mrs. van Stopele,” I told her.
Perhaps with impatience, •
one of her fingers on the
divan armrest twitched, and as
a reflex that chameleon
dabbed her finger with its
tongue at about 15in. range.
There is no doubt that Mrs.
van Stopele was the hysterical
type, for her reaction was to
shriek and come off that
divan like a springboard diver.
I am not too sure how it
all happened, but there was
Mr. van Stopele paying no
attention to his wife and me
with my waistcoat wedged
behind her shoulders and one
of her wrists grasped in each
of my hands. Powerful squeals
issued from the recently re-
fuelled female body.
Mr. van Stopele did not
seem to hear. For me, because
of her reinforced upholstery,
it was rather like embracing a
wire cage " crammed with
ear - splitting parrots. That
chameleon had returned to the
immobility of moulded brass
again.
■Cor a moment Mr. van
Stopele came quickly past
the divan and I thought he
was concerned with his wife’s
welfare, but he was interested
in quite a different situation.
He snatched the anti-tank rifle
from Hando, pulled out the
huge bolt, squinted down the
barrel, swore unrestrainedly
and caught Hando a clout on
the ear. Then, instead of
smashing the chameleon or
reviving his wife, he took that
rifle out through the full-
length windows and across the
lawn to his workshop.
“I say, sir,” I squeaked after
him, “you have forgotten
your coffee.”
My squeak was lost among
Mrs. van Stopele’s squeals.
Hando stood motionless right
where Mr. van Stopele had
clquted him, and like his
master he made no attempt to
assist Mrs. van Stopele.
When Mrs. van Stopele be-
came articulate I released her
from my straitjacket em-
brace. “Don’t kill it, don’t
kill it,” she sobbed.
I didn’t kill it. I pulled its
suction pads off the decorated
wall and I carried it outside
to a thevetia-tree on the lawn,
where it protruded its swivel-
ling eyes on a praying-mantis.
Then I went back inside the
dayroom and nervously loaded
Tale’s uncolored crystals into
the wrong cup and I drank-
off that powdered coffee before
I remembered not to.
Mrs. van Stopele's eyes
swivelled to the empty cup
and they protruded with a
jerk.
“Do you ever get sick,” she
asked, “with love?”
“For me, Mrs. van Stopele,”
I told her, “the condition is
perennial.”
Now that her husband had
gone, Mrs. van Stopele re-
gained her composure. In fact
I half - suspected that her
hysteria was an attempt to
attract his attention, but I
didn’t really know. Anyway,
she hurried away to take her
afternoon nap and Hando
cleared away the coffee-
service.
“This coffee we drink,” I
said to Hando, “is it grown on
the estate here?”
“Truly, guest,” he informed
me.
“Well, it tastes like burnt
hair,” I told him.
Left alone, I uncovered my
adding - machine, filled my
fountain-pen, opened the
account-books of the estate
and worked at my task of
discerning the financial posi-
tion of the van Stopeles.
The burnt-hair coffee in my
stomach became restless after
a little while so I took it for
a walk out past the thevetia-
tree to try to calm it. The
praying-mantis had disappeared
now, and that chameleon was
pesky moulded brass again.
Through the window of his
workshop I observed Mr. van
Stopele. He had a broken
rhino-horn in the bench-vice,
and he was artistically shaping
an artificial tip to it made of
plastic putty. That plastic
putty toned in exactly with
the genuine horn.
“Hullo,” Mr. van Stopele
growled at me, “have you
stopped playing around with
my wife?”
“I have been examining the
estate’s accounts, sir,” I re-
plied stiffly.
“What’s the financial posi-
tion?” he asked shortly.
“You are broke, sir,” I said.
“Oh?” he said. “Don’t you
believe it.”
“What I mean .is,” I ex-
plained, “that you cannot find
sufficient cash to pay next
month’s wages.”
“Can’t I?” he inquired. He
laid aside that mended rhino-
horn and he began to pull-
through the huge barrel of
his anti-tank rifle. “I can find
sufficient cash,” he said, “be-
cause I am in the rhino-horn
business.”
“Hah,” I said solemnly.
IVow, the rhino-horn business
is illegal. First you hunt
for a good-sized rhino-horn,
then you kill the rhino
attached to it. You cut off
the good-sized horn and you
sell it to a sly Asian dealer.
These Asian dealers will pay
20s. an ounce for rhino-horn.
They grind it to powder and
sell it as an aphrodisiac in the
East, where it is believed to
be a cure for frigidity, sterility,
sexual debility or just plain
laziness.
The plastic putty tip Mr.
van Stopele had added to this
broken horn on the bench had
probably increased the horn’s
weight by 15oz. As long as
the dealer was stone-blind or
dead-stupid he would pay 300
shillings for those 15oz. I
had a quick mental picture of
a beautiful sareed lady in Cal-
cutta quietly slipping powdered
plastic putty into her hus-
band’s coffee.
“Come with me,” invited Mr.
van Stopele as he put together
his anti-tank rifle, “and let
us exploit the rhino-horn busi-
ness.”
“Very well, sir,” I said.
We walked across the lawn
past the huge ornamental
overgrown rockery into a patch
of skeletonish coffee-trees. A
gang was spraying those trees
for thrips. Further on another
gang was hoeing rich chocolate


soil in preparation for fresh
planting.
“The money you have
wasted on that ornamenetal
rockery, sir,” I said, “could
have been used to eradicate
thrips completely and
rotary hoes.’’
“My wife asked for the
rockery,” explained Mr. van
Stopele. “but she never tended
it.”
We passed rusting farm-
in achin e r y, weatherbeaten
vehicles and a first-class bad-
minton court. “You have con-
structed an excellent hangar
for badminton, sir,” I said,
“while your vehicles depreciate
in the open air.”
“My wife demanded the bad-
minton-court,’’ he explained,
“but she never played on it.”
We followed an avenue of
tall grevilleas past the vast
swimpool. Workers were
dipping buckets into the swim-
pool and carrying water to
coffee-trees. “You have spent
money on geljgnite to blast
this swimpool out of volcanic
rock, sir,” I said, “but a
reticulation of watering-pipes
to your coffee-trees would have
been more profitable.”
“My wife commanded the
swimpool,” he explained, “but
she never swam in it.”
This vast swimpool was so
clear I could see a young hippo
strolling along the stone bottom
in the 18ft. depression under
the diving-boards. The young
hippo must have dilated his
lungs, I suppose, for he floated
up to the surface, snuffled a
bit and sank again. Clumsy on
land but light as a balloon in
the deep pool.
Mr. van Stopele turned away
from the swimpool toward the
open bushland. He followed
up a tongue of solidified lava
whose crevices and tunnels
were filled with a gushing
stream. He pushed his huge
bulk up that tongue of lava
quite silently and he avoided
debris and crevices with skill.
Obviously this pastime suited
him.
r TT!E lower branches of trees
along the stream were
stripped of bark. Rhinos’
horns had dug caverns into the
red cliffs, and rhinos’ tongues
had polished the surfaces of
the caverns in search of salt.
I kept about fifty yards behind
Mr. van Stopele, for, in the
event of needing to climb a
tree at speed, I didn’t wish to
compete with Mr. van Stopele.
Black-and-white c o 1 o b u s-
monkeys exploded into crash-
ing noises in the high trees,
and I jumped with shock ; but
Mr. van Stopele did not even
turn his head.
Later, I heard nothing, but
Mr. van Stopele turned his
head and seemed to sniff the
air. He sdt up the anti-tank
rifle, and I climbed a tree.
A pointed-mouth rhino with
a good-sized horn came out
onto the hard lava-bed of the
stream all right. That rhino
“ Didn't you know that her husband joined the parachute
regiment?”
fussed about a bit. Mr. van
Stopele waved his hat and it
moved up toward him. He
transfixed it with an armor-
piercing slug, and the roar of
his rifle almost shook me out
of my tree. By the time I
climbed down, estate-workers
were already appearing with
knives to cup up that dead
rhino.
As we walked back to his
house, Mr. van Stopele talked
a little wildly. Perhaps this
wildness was due to exhilara-
tion at having destroyed an
enormous beast, perhaps due
to his ability to pay next
month’s wages.
“Why do you think my wife
forced me to build the rockery,
the badminton-court and the
swimpool when , she never
used them?” he inquired
loudly.
“Women are a subject I
know nothing about, sir,” I
reassured him.
“She believes a wife’s duty is
to keep testing her husband,”
he raved madly. “Those
exorbitant toys are nothing
more than tests of my desire
for her.”
“I see, sir,” I lied.
We could look out over
ugly fertile lowlands to beauti-
ful sterile snowcapped peaks
seventy miles out. The lowlands
must have boiled like porridge
once ; now >the solidified
bubbles were volcanic peaks.
The whole picture was painted
with sun-patches stencilled by
moving clouds.
YI/hen we reached the house
we found that Mrs. van
Stopele had blown herself up
with gelignite. She had done it
in the kitchen and I am not
going to describe that kitchen.
Suffice to say that death was
instantaneous and horribly
exaggerated.
After dizziness in my skull
had cooled down and I had
exhausted myself in trying to
vomit onto the lawn, I found
Mr. van Stopele sitting alone
in the dayroom. His face was
as grey as old shrouds.
“I didn’t believe she would
go so far,” he muttered rather
madly.
“You better lie down, sir,”
I*said, but he did not seem to
hear.
Distractedly he reached
down a bird-bow from the wall
and two or three arrows. “X
adored her once,” he said.
His first bolt slipped through
the full-length windows,
skewered the chameleon and
carried it ten feet past the
thevetia' tree. “But she tested
me too much,” he said.
Mr. van Stopele tested the
bird-bow by bending it double
three or four times so that
fibrous damage became audible.
After such testing that bird-
bow could not hurl the next
bolt as far as the thevetia tree.
“And in the end my desire
■was gone and 1 had to neglect
her,” he said. He dropped the
bow in the hearth.
“All right,” 1 said.
“She must have been un-
happy,” he said. “She even
flirted with you.”
“She must have been des-
perate,” 1 said.
“She was trying to make me
jealous,” he explained. “She
pretended to be frightened of
that chameleon just to capture
my interest and attention.”
“Why don’t you lie down,
sir?” I asked.
Hando bustled through the
dayroom from the kitchen. His
smock, usually white as coffee-
bloom, was now a streaky
geranium.
“She even tried slipping that
powdered rhino-horn into my
coffee,” said Mr. van Stopele.
“You know. She used to grind
it down in the kitchen coffee-
grinder.”
“Come along, sir,” I said
firmly, “off to your room.”
A fter I got him horizontal
in his own room I came
back to the dayroom and
looked thoughtfully at the
rhino-horns on the decorated
wall. Some of the tips were
unnaturally long and 1 suspect-
ed they were artificially added.
T broke off one tip with a
little trouble. It looked on the
outside like genuine rhino horn,
but it was really painted plastic
putty. Inside that covering of
plastic putty was a packed core
of gelignite.
And, of course, inside that
core of gelignite for a little
yellow kernel was a bright
detonator. Mentally 1 tried the
experiment of feeding that
artificial tip into a coffee-
grinder.
Because I had completed my
task of informing Mr. van
Stopele of his financial posi-
tion, I drove out to his airstrip
and flew back to civilisation
with no delay.

In Australia’s earliest days colonial government
was hampered and harassed by paper shortages,
so it is not surprising that paper-making became
one of the new land’s first manufacturing
industries. The first mill was set up in 1818
beside a small stream in what is now Sydney’s
Centennial Park. Operated by two enterprising
colonists, Fisher and Duncan, the mill produced
paper from rags for some years—but then,
because of circumstances of which there is no
record, it fell into ruin. The Fisher-Duncan
mill was the direct ancestor of all paper-making
in Australia, today a tremendous and developing
industry of first importance to the nation and
its economy.
It was the forerunner of the company that is
known today as Australian Paper Manufacturers
Limited, which operates seven mills through the
Commonwealth, produces hundreds of tons of
paper-board and paper daily, employs thousands
of Australian workers, plants millions l of new
trees, engages in continuous scientific research—
and is owned by 27,000 Australians.

Theatre-week in Canberra
/Canberra is not yet a name that looms
large in the theatrical firmament, but
it can boast one evergreen show which,
although played to very small audiences,
is publicised and reviewed in almost
every newspaper in Australia.
It is, indeed, an institution. Not per-
haps comparable with the Old Vic or the
Stratford Memorial Theatre —an old-
time stock-company playing “East Lynne”
or “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” would be a
closer parallel—its short annual season
follows a stylised pattern.
Minor changes are made in the cast
from time to time, but the newcomers
quickly absorb the atmosphere and tradi-
tion of the piece and are themselves ab-
sorbed and merged in the play. Slight
changes of dialogue and business are
permitted, but it is many years since any
major alteration 'was allowed, or even
attempted. If anyone were rash enough
to try to change it now the trouble he
would run into would probably be com-
parable with the storm aroused by Gil-
bert and Sullivan enthusiasts when some-
body accents a wrong syllable in one of
the patter-songs.
The first performance of the Loan
Council wasn't staged in Canberra at all,
but in Melbourne, in the financial year
1923-24. It was then almost an amateur
show, giving little promise that it was
destined to become a hallowed institu-
tion. Of the original cast, only two are
still alive —the elegant, urbane S. M.
Bruce, now the wealthily-pensioned
(though not by the Actors’ Benevolent
Society) Viscount Bruce of Melbourne,
and his active, energetic foil, Dr. Page,
now the elder-statesman Sir Earle Page.
T>Y the time the show shifted to Can-
berra in 1927 the two originals had
become practised performers, but the
show in general remained rather a
pedestrian affair, despite occasional
brilliant individual efforts by stylists such
as Jack Lang and Ted Theodore. During
the depression years, when the legitimate
stage elsewhere in Australia was taking
a thrashing, the stock-company, with only
one play in its repertoire, managed to
struggle through, its all-star cast aug-
mented at limes by such names as Otto
Niemeyer and Douglas Copland.
It was in 1944 that the show first be-
came recognisably like the performance of
today. To the somewhat drab Loan
Council drama was added a curtain-raiser
with the forbidding title, “The Common-
wealth-States Financial Arrangements for
Tax Reimbursement.” Despite its title,
this curtain-raiser became and remains
a popular addition to the bill ; to each
year’s performance the actors seem to
bring a fresh spirit of expectation and
hope. Introduced when Ben Chifley was
in his prime, it afforded plenty of scope
for verbal exchanges between him and
Handsome Jim McGirr, with Uncle Tom
Playford throwing in little wisps of
homespun philosophy, and other charac-
ters playing their parts with varying de-
grees of enthusiasm. When Bob Menzies
and Artie Fadden took over the leading
roles the same pattern continued, gradu-
ally crystallising into the highly polished
performance of the present day.
nPHE plot is simple. The Prime Minister
announces that all are aware of the
purpose of the gathering, which is to cut-
up the duck. No one disputes this,
although in the scripts of some of the per-
formances of other years there have been
differences of opinion as to what kind of
bird it is they are carving. The Premiers
don’t seem strong on ornithology ; they
describe it variously as a duck, a turkey,
a chook and a crow —on one occasion,
and in a moment of exasperation, as a
tomtit. Uncle Tom is also on record as
commenting that it isn’t merely a matter
of carving the bird ; it is also important
who gets the first slice.
The Prime Minister then says if they
carve in accordance with the dotted lines
shown in the Carvers’ Manual —he calls
it the formula—they'll get such-and-
such quantities. He invites them to
comment. They do so, individually and
at length. When all have done there is
no point in reaching for the knife. Even
the bird itself, dead as it is, could tell
them that there just aren’t enough slices
in it to meet their demands.
The Prime Minister then makes a
gesture that is calculated to bring down
the house, but doesn’t, because the
Premiers have been calculating, too. He
offers to throw-in one of his own slices,
to be cut-up as they please. The Premiers,
with unanimity but with varying degrees
of vehemence, tell him the slice isn’t big
enough, whereupon he suggests that they’d
perhaps like to go back to the old system,
under which each man shot his own bird,
and that if they like to come to an agree-
ment about an open season with adequate
safety measures, he’ll be glad to consider
it. All agree that this would be a very
good thing—someday.
The Premiers then accept their slices as
per schedule, plus the P.M.’s slice, utter-
ing as they do so doleful prophecies of
poverty and ruin. As they wrap-up their
slices in greaseproof paper the Premiers
try to look as if they’ve got less than
they expected, and the Prime Minister and
Treasurer try to look as if they’ve given
away more than they intended. No one
is quite successful in this.
CHudents of a future generation, poring
over the First Folios of these annual
plays, may deplore certain differences in
the text from year to year. However, most
people will agree that it is probably these
little variations, the nuances of dialogue,
the little ad-libs, that have really kept the
play alive. Who will say, for example,
that the 1953 version didn’t gain from the
accident of most of the principals being
away at a Royal Command performance,
thus giving their understudies a chance
to show their paces?
It was on that occasion that Bobby
Heffron ad-libbed a line about “customary
wranglings,” to which Menzies replied,
“Don’t call them ‘wranglings.’ Call them
‘exchanges of ideas.’ ” Heffron stuck to
his own script. In the same performance
Bill Galvin, from Victoria, thrust in the
line that has become almost traditional
among State Premiers —“it is impossible
for us to carry on.” He also warned
Menzies that “the people of this country
will wreak their vengeance on you at the
earliest opportunity.”
Since then the people have had three
opportunities of wreaking their vengeance,
and they’ve passed ’em all by. But it is
still a good line, and worth preserving. *
So is Jack Duggan’s (spoken when
he was standing-in for Vince Gair): “We
have sovereign powers, but apparently
that means that we have the powers and
the Federal Government the sovereigns.”
Duggan was also responsible for a remark
which may puzzle future students of the
the Folios: — “As a result of Mr.
Rafferty coming into it, Queensland has
lost £873,000.” There is no record of a
Mr. Rafferty in the cast that year, or any
year, but obviously he must have played
some part in the show.
The Loan Council drama, played with
the same cast as the curtain-raiser, is a
private performance from which critics
are excluded. No scripts are available,
but apparently it follows closely the plot
of the curtain-raiser. After it is over the
performers reassemble as a mutual-
admiration society, exchange valedictory
remarks and adjourn until the following
season.
HPhe 1959 season is due to open any day
now. There'll be quite a few changes
in the cast. Black Jack McEwen will be
standing-in for veteran actor Bob Menzies,
and the plum part of Federal Treasurer,
played for years by Artie Fadden, has
gone to Harold Holt, tipped in some
quarters as a future Academy Award
winner. Old-timers Uncle Tom Playford
and Joe Cahill will be playing the parts
they know backwards; Frank Nicklin,
after a couple of seasons, should be feel-
ing more at home in the role of Northern
Needier, and Eric Reece, too, should be
getting into his stride. With Henry Bolte
away on Broadway, his understudy, A. G.
Rylah, will be playing the role of the
Modern Victorian, but the only
really new player will be David Brand,
considered by Perth critics to be a real
find.
The players are ready, their parts well-
conned. Everything seems set for another
successful run of the old favorite.

Though—as often happens
in main races in other States
also —the prizemoney in the
E. E. D. White Lightning
Handicap at Eagle Farm last
Saturday was won by visiting
horses, the result made its own
good comment on the excel-
lent Brisbane handicapping.
The sprint was won by Second
Earl, with Fountainhead and
Grey Ghost in the places ; they
carried, respectively, 8.5, 9st.
and 9.3, and there was a half-
head and a nose between them.
A handicapper can’t be asked
to do better than that.
The Lightning Handicap
result has direct bearing on
the Q.T.C.’s Stradbroke Handi-
cap, to be run next Saturday
week. An important feature
was the defeat of early Strad-
broke favorite Gay Port
(favorite also in the five-
furlongs Lightning). Gay
Port’s usual jockey, Tom Hill,
had to force the brilliant
sprinter along in the early
stages to keep-up with the
speedy beginners, and he failed
to maintain the pressure, miss-
ing a place in the blanket-
finish, but a very close fourth.
Gay Port should be better
suited by the seven furlongs
of the Stradbroke. Fountain-
head’s performance was par-
ticularly striking, but the rich
Brisbane sprint looks as open
as Sydney Heads, with any one
of six likely to land the big
end of the £lO,OOO.
Most Stradbroke horses that
raced last weekend drop a few
pounds in weight for that
coming event. In fact, Gay
Port will carry 121 b. less, which
seems a strong pointer in his
favor, provided he retains fit-
ness. Skyline didn’t beat much
at Rosehill, but Second Earl
certainly had a tough bunch
behind him in the Lightning—
some of the fastest horses from
New Zealand and in training
in Australia.

secured the Rosehill mount
when J. Green’s usual jockey,

Balfast, Foxmara and Mac-
dougal all three fancied
for the £12,000 Brisbane Cup
(June 15) —were beaten last
Saturday, the first-named at
Rosehill and the other two in
Brisbane. Balfast was thought
by his trainer, Doug Webster,
to be a real chance at Rosehill
with 8.13, though the distance
(10 furlongs) was considered a
trifle short. Balfast ran a solid
race, and was doing well in
fourth place at the finish, out
in the middle of the track.
He was one of the last lot
round the home-turn. A drop
of 131 b. (to Bst.) and the longer
distance of the Brisbane race
(two miles) will favor him: He
is a true stayer, and there
do not seem to be more than
three or four of them in the
Brisbane Cup.

T. W. Green has had four
wins with two-year-old filly
My Melodee and three with
Royal Jester one with the
latter at Randwick late in
March and two at recent Rose-

has received excellent prices
on most occasions, and 8 to 1
for the Rosehill Handicap last
Saturday seemed generous, in
view of the gelding's stylish
success in the Lord Mayor’s
Cup two weeks earlier. In
each win Royal Jester cams
from the rear, and though he
is up in the weights now —he
carried 9st. at his latest outing
—he could be a Cup horse in
the spring. Green proposes to
rest the four-year-old for a
few weeks, then get him ready
for the bigger game in the new
season. Royal Jester is by
Timanova (imp.) from Tendril
(imp.) by His Highness from
Oversay by Monument, and is
bred to stay. His family-lines
include Imprudence, a winner
of the English Oaks. Green
is also giving My Melodee a
rest for a few weeks. She has
earned it.

Sellwood didn’t take long to
win a race after the fall which
kept him from the saddle. His
mount Huntly handed-out a
disappointing run, but two
races later Sellwood won on
Caybros, who started at brief
odds for the Auburn Stakes
and landed the money with-
out much pressure. The geld-
ing, who had scored over the
same distance (10 furlongs) at
Randwick earlier in the month,
is a potential stayer ; he’s bred
that way. He carried 9st. at
Rosehill and now goes to open
company, where he may be
carrying light weights.
Newcastle - trained horses
won two races at Rosehill last
Saturday week, and at the
same track last Saturday two
of the seven- events went to
country winners, Flash Hero
taking the First Parramatta
Stakes and Gay Crag the
Second. Gay Crag is trained
at Tamworth by L. Small, who
was making his first city visit
for more than 30 years. His
winner looks a galloper with
a bright future ; he could win
sprints in much belter com-
pany, and can still run in
restricted events at city fixtures,
as can Flash Hero, who,
trained by D. Edwards, won
at Scone three weeks ago.
Old-’uns took a hand in the
Rosehill Welter, Redbank and
Aluinn —each seven (nearly
eight) finishing first and
second, with one of the three-
year-olds, Winchester, third.
Aluinn came from the rear of
the field, but Redbank cleared
out in the final furlong or so
and had plenty of daylight
between him and the runner-up
at the end. He is trained at
Randwick by Frank Selkrig
and was ridden by the trainer’s
son, Ray, who is leading Syd-
ney jockey at the moment and
trying hard to win the 1958-
59 premiership. Redbank ran
the nine furlongs without
trouble. In most prior races
he had shown best form up
to 7y furlongs and maybe
will now be tested at a longer
distance, though he’s a Port
Vista, and they’re noted as
sprinters.

At the Valley
Last Saturday’s meeting was
conducted by the Moonee
Valley Racing Club for the
benefit of Victoria’s hunt-
clubs—one of the two such
meetings staged each year.
There is a good deal of con-
troversy about the necessity


for such meetings, some hold-
ing that the hunt-club members
are well able to finance their
own activities; the opposing
view is that the hunt-clubs help
the breeding of jumping horses.
In point of fact the hunt-clubs
haven't furnished any good-
class steeplechasers in recent
years—the fields for such races
as the Melbourne Hunt Steeple-
chase last Saturday are made-
up of veteran ’chasers whose
chance of winning a city cross-
country event belongs to their
past heyday.
The link between the clubs
and city racing goes back to
1899, when the first Hunters’
Steeplechase was run on
Moonee Valley Cup day for a
prize of £l5O donated by an
Oakfands Hunt Club member.
In the early years of this
century some of Melbourne's
best steeplechasers did come
from the hunt-club ranks.
• • • •
To be eligible for last Satur-
day’s Hunt Steeplechase horses
must have been hunted with a
recognised pack of hounds at
least five times in 1958 or
twice in 1959. Entries could
be ridden by either amateur
or professional riders, the pro-
fessionals to carry a 101 b.
penalty. In the dark about
hunt-club form, those race-
goers who bothered to bet on
the event followed the lead
for the even-money chance
Gangetic, who had the services
of B. R. Smith, but, after lead-
ing over the last fence by 15
lengths, Gangetic stopped to
a walk and was beaten to the
line by the seven-year-old
David Kingsburgh mare
Knoxie.
The Lyndhurst Handicap
for two-year-olds over the
Valley’s 6 furlongs less 20yds.
had to be run in three divisions.
The winner of the first heat,
Pride of Persia, started at the
remarkable odds of 20 to 1 —
remarkable not because of the
gelding’s form—he had none ;
it was his first start —but be-
cause he is a Fred Hoysted-
trained youngster, and one does
not expect Hoysted’s winning
two-year-olds to drift from
eights to twenties, as Pride of
Persia did, particularly with
such a good rider as Frank
Treen aboard. The gelding is
out of Breccia by Great
Western, who won at w.f.a. in
Melbourne, and he bears a
remarkable resemblance to his
sire.
There was another surprise
in the second Lyndhurst, when
Sir Emblem won at even longer
odds. This colt had raced only
once before, and is perhaps
unlucky not to have an un-
beaten record. At his only
other start he ran second in
a small event at Geelong, and
protested unsuccessfully. By
High Peak from Gold Fern,
he might be more than useful.
He beat two promising young-
sters in minor-placegetters
Woambra and Smoke Flare.
The winner was bred by his
owner, A. E. Moss, who trains
him.
Of all the horses in the three
heats of the Lyndhurst, most
will probably be heard of the
winner of the third division,
My Peak, by Sir Emblem’s sire,
High Peak, out of Aversion.
Geoff Lane has rarely had as
easy a ride as he enjoyed on
High Peak, who was never at
full gallop to win the race. In
March the High Peak colt
careered away with a similar
event at the Valley, and at his
only other start had the M.V.
Lalpma Handicap well wqn at
the turn, but then suffered a
bleeding-attack. If he con-
tinues to race against winter
company he cannot help but
win more races.
It has been said here more
than once that punters at
Moonee Valley are w'ell
advised to look for gallopers
who have proved their ability
to handle the ‘ little” track.
Probe, who won the 13-
furlongs Hallam Handicap, is
a dyed-in-the-wool Valley
specialist. The five-year-old
Detector gelding has won no
fewer than six races over the
13-furlongs Valley route, and
on the other two metropoli-
tan tracks he has never been
of much account.
If a horse has aptitude for
the jumping game he usually
reveals it speedily, as Helles-
pride did in winning the Ber-
wick Trial Hurdle at his first
essay at a jumping-race. At
one time in his good career on
the flat Hellespride was rated
a Caulfield Cup hope, but
over the last year or so he has
lost some of his pace. One
of the last of the Hellesponts
to race, he is out of Em-
borough’s Pride by Emborough
from Silent Pride by Orby’s
Pride. It is too soon to be
talking of Nationals after a
Trial Hurdle win, but it will
be interesting to see how much
the gelding can improve on his
successful jumping debut.
It would be hard to measure
the distance between a 10-
furlongs winter handicap at
the Valley and a Caulfield Cup,
but it is a journey that con-
nections of Maringle are quite
confident the gelding can
travel. This lightly-raced
youngster by dual Derbys
winner Alister out of Gamble
in Gold will bear watching.
At his previous start he won
a Maiden at Warrnambool with
ridiculous ease ; and he scored
his four-lengths win over an
f.-a.-q. winter field in the
Clyde Handicap last Saturday
without effort.
One statistician of the
racing-game gave it as ’ his
opinion that there were 194
ways in which a horse could
lose a race. The connections of
former South Australian gal-
loper Rehaboam were unfor-
tunate enough to strike one of
the unusual ones at the Valley.
The Ottoman gelding had
raced a couple of times in
Melbourne without getting
near the money, prior to his
run in the Dandenong Handi-
cap. He must have shown
his connections something
unusual on the track to
inspire a betting-spree that
reduced his price from 10's to
7-to-2 favorite, and he looked
certain to land the money
when he moved up stylishly to
fourth at the half-mile. There,
however, a beaten horse
dropped back on him, and in
a stride Rehaboam was out of

The Trots
Jenny, starting from the
72yds.-behind mark, gave a
faultless exhibition of trotting
in winning the Trotters’ Handi-
cap at Harold Park last Satur-
day night. Travelling smoothly,
Jenny was well up at the bell,
took the lead in the back
stretch, and went on to win
comfortably from Shellgrit and
Single Raider. Favorite Lucky
Vale was well placed to the
bell, but weakened in the run
home.
Three-year-old High View
broke a run of minor placings
to win the Three-year-old
Stakes from the Victorian
gelding Light Report. Re-
cently he ran a place in a
heat of the N.S.W. Derby,
with a creditable sixth in the
final, after breaking at the
start. High View on Saturday
night trailed the early leader
for two laps, took over coming
to the bell, raced clear over
the last lap and easily held off
challenges in the run home.
In the Harold Park Handi-
cap consistent Victorian pacer
Marciano won his third race
from five starts at the Park ; he
has now raced his way into
open-company handicaps. Slow
to begin, he settled down in
fourth place, followed by
favorite Kerryfield, who led
him home the previous week.
Moving into second place be-
hind Night Reveller at the bell,

Lions and Others
At Sydney Sportsground, in
a bright and attractive game of
Rugby-Union, N.S.W. defeated
the British Isles 18-14, after
trailing 9-11 at half-time. (On
their last two tours, in 1930
and in 1950, N.S.W. had also
beaten British Isles.) The
Lions were handicapped by
losing left - winger Brophy
lOmin. after the start, and, a
replacement not being allowed,
had to play a man short for
the rest of the game.
N.S.W. scored first, smin.
from the start, when, after five-
eighth Summons and young
half-back “discovery” Catch-
pole had made penetrating
runs, the ball went across the
back-line for Morton to score
near the corner. The Lions
equalised with a try smin.
later, when right-winger Young,
who is really fast, crossed after
a swerving, side-stepping run ;
Risman’s kick hit the top of a
post and fell back.
Less than two minutes later
breakaway Murphy crossed,
somewhat effortlessly, for Ris-
man to goal, and a runaway
win for the visitors seemed not
unlikely. However, N.S.W.
tightened its defence, and its
forwards—playing now against
a pack a man short —began to
get an edge in lineouts and
general play. The Lions crossed
again before half-time, a nice
backline move ending in Fault,
the lock-forward who had been
transferred to Brophy’s wing,
getting the first of his two
tries. Roberts kicked two
penalty-goals for N.S.W.
before half-time, for the 11-9
half-time score.
N.S.W. opened the second-
half with a neat field-goal by
Summons —one of his special-
ties —and scored two more
tries to one by the Lions. None
of the three tries was con-
verted.
The result, of course, can’t
be taken as a sure guide to
results in the two Tests to be
played. First Test, in Brisbane
on Saturday.
“Joseph”: Two of the
British Lions’ best players in
their 53-18 overrunning of Vic-
toria were wingers Young and
Jackson. Those names in com-
bination are, of course, not
unknown to Victorians. Jack-
son scored three tries, Young
one —Young’s after a long,
dazzling run.
* * #
Feature of Saturday’s V.F.L.
round was that only one team
—and that Collingwood, in its
first victory (at last!) for the
season—won at home. Carlton
and North remain unbeaten,
Melbourne still lies third, and
St. Kilda comes into “the four”
in place of Hawthorn. Carlton
beat Hawthorn in a fast, grip-
ping game 12.11-11.9, while
North, which has only just
scraped-in in its previous two
games, this time had a clear
five-goal margin over injury-
troubled South, 13.18-8.18.
Melbourne ran away in the
second half from Geelong,
19.15-11.10, while St. Kilda
kicked straighter than Rich-
mond in a game in which run
of play was fairly even,
16.10-11.17. Essendon, though
its kicking was astray, ran all
over Fitzroy in the last quarter,
12.22-11.9, and Collingwood
looked a bit more like the
Magpies of old in beating
Footscray 16.16-10.11.

“Solly”: Ray (“Horner”)
Schofield, veteran of 277
League games (B. 13/5/’59), is
still in the news. West Perth,
his old club, has lost all its
first-round matches, and at
time of writing there was a
move afoot by a group of club
supporters to induce Homer to
return. Homer is now well set
with Hellenic, in the Sunday

tract to play and coach “to his

Queensland, which has suf-
fered crushing defeats by
N.S.W. in recent years, did
much better in the first two

games in Brisbane this year—
it had a close 17-15 win last
Wednesday night and, on
Saturday, was beaten by 24-14,
but scored the same number
of tries as N.S.W. (four)....
The N.Z. Kiwis won all their
first three games comfortably,
the stiffest opposition coming
from Northern N.S.W. last
Sunday; N.Z., 26-11.... In
Sydney’s competition Balmain
came from well behind to hold
St. George to a 20-all draw,
helped by an off-day in his
kicking by controversial
veteran St. George forward
Harry Bath, who kicked only
one goal; West demolished
Parramatta 24-2 ; in two upsets
Newtown tossed North 16-14
and Canterbury astonished
Manly 12-7; and on Sunday
East beat South 20-11.
Scottish Soccer club Heart
of Midlothian overran Aus-
tralia 9-1 in the fourth Test in
Melbourne, after being held
to a 2-0 lead at half-time. On

two main Federation games in
Sydney Corrimal beat Sydney
Austral 2-1, and on Sunday
Prague held-off Hakoah 3-0.

championship in Brisbane (B.

He played rep. football at
Lithgow (N.S.W.), where he
was electrical-engineer at the
State coalmine. He actually
learned the rudiments of bowls
—the stance and the way to
deliver and “address” the kitty
—underground, in a deputy’s
cabin. The lesson took place at
crib-time, the miners’ lunch-
break. The mentor was Harry
Dalziell, a leading local player
who afterwards won rinks’
fame as a member of Thirroul
Club (N.S.W. South Coast).
Downie—now with City Club,
Newcastle (N.S.W.) —has won

73 YEARS OF SERVICE
TO THE AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC
UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
BRITAIN INTO SPACE
Come press comments on the
U.K. Government’s de-
cision to launch a “limited”
programme of space-research:
London “Financial Times”
scientific correspondent:
“Britain is entering this field for
three major reasons: firstly, the
U.K. relies on its being a
scientific nation in order to
survive as a major Power;
secondly, the U.K. requires the
fundamental scientific informa-
tion which can be gained only
from flying satellites, for the
further development of scien-
tific work already in progress ;
thirdly, the U.K. will benefit in
terms of information of im-
mense value to the designers of
defence equipment.”
The same : “The immediate
aim is to develop instruments
capable of measuring certain
fundamental facts about outer
space—the behavior of the sun,
the stars and planets, and con-
cerning the earth—which can-
not be measured by any satel-
lites so far sent into space.
“The U.K. has here a decided
advantage in that it has greater
experience in nuclear physics—
in particular, designing certain
types of radioactive-radiation
measuring equipment than
any other country in the world.
“The immediate plan is to
establish what is known as
‘Operation Crossbow,’ or the
interchange of information,
and possibly of satellite con-
tainers and rocket-vehicles, be-
tween the U.K. and the U.S.
In doing this, while the U.K.
inevitably lags far behind
Russia and the U.S. in rocket-
propulsion hardware, or actual
vehicles, it still has much to

“YOU GOTTA HAND IT TO THESE LIMEYS—THEY SURE KNOW HOW
TO SAVE MONEY!"
offer. This is especially true
in the field of telemetry, or
communications-systems be-
tween satellites and the earth,
and in the field of guiding and
controlling the behavior of
rockets sent up to launch the
satellites.”
* * *
London “Economist” : “De-
velopment of the satellites and
their instruments need not cost
more, according to Lord Hail-
sham, than some hundreds-of-
thousands of pounds. But
launching them will cost
millions at a rough guess,
perhaps £lO to £l5 million for
the whole programme. Last
winter the United States made
a vaguely worded offer to
launch satellites for other
countries. Scientists are going
to America to find precisely
what this involves and whether
it offers a short-cut into space
that will save the time and
expense involved in construct-
ing a satellite-launching rocket
out of the ballistic missiles now.,
being built in this country.
“Although Lord Hailsham
was careful not to commit him-
self, the impression remains
that British hopes of this short-
cut do not run particularly
high: but the decision cannot
be taken one way or the other
until the facts become avail-
able.
“The most encouraging part
of the announcement was not
that the Government had de-
cided to go into space, since
this has not seriously been in
doubt, but that it appeared to
take the decision with a fairly
convincing air of scientific
detachment. And this, consid-
ering the highly partisan nature
of the advice that it was and
still is being given, is certainly
commendable.”
Ed i n b u r g h “Scotsman” :
“Work of this kind, which can
be carried out with ordinary
earth-satellites and not requir-
ing, for instance, moon- or sun-
probes, will do something to
keep space-minded British scien-
tists on the frontiers of know-
ledge. There is no point in
pretending, however, that it .will
satisfy all of them. For some
the enormous American pro-
gramme will have an irresistibly
strong attraction. Those who
really want a career in space-
travel can find it only by going
abroad. That may seem de-
plorable to people who think
Britain must compete on all
conceivable fronts at once, but
it would be far more deplor-
able to pour out thousands-of-
millions of pounds on adven-
ture which promises at best
indirect returns.”
* * *
Earl Jellicoe, in a letter to
London “Daily Telegraph ” : “I
am glad that after some
apparent dithering the Govern-
ment has decided that Britain
should go into space, if possible
in co-operation with other
countries. But the programme
outlined by the Prime Minister
looks both late and little.
“Late: Clearly the proposed
approach to the Americans is
sensible. The only odd thing
is that the ground was not
cleared in this way at least 18
months ago.
“Little: Having started late
we have leeway to make up.
And this cannot usually be
done on the cheap.
“In short, it rather looks—
as things are at present —as if
the Government may hope,
with a little bit of luck and
effort, and with a little bit of
money, to earn a small place in
space.
“I hope that results will
dispel this suspicion, and that
Lord Hailsham will impart his
customary relish and vigor to
a full-blooded programme con-
certed not only with the
United States of America but
also, and intimately, with the
[British] Commonwealth.”

space has a sensible and busi-

significance is deplorable. It
means that Britain is still with-

the Americans and the Rus-
sians.
“That situation is quite un-
satisfactory to a nation which

London “News Chronicle ” :
“The scientists will be interest-
ed in research rather than
prestige and in discovering
truths rather than in putting
Union Jacks on to the moon.
Professor Massey, who is to be
in charge of the new experi-
ments, stressed that success in
space-research depended on
cross-checking by different
countries. Co-operation rather
than competition ensures
advance in astronomy.
“The Government is wise to
send experts to Washington to
discuss co-operation with the
Americans, and it has also
approached Commonwealth
countries to consider sharing a
satellite. The Government
should also seek full co-opera-
tion with the Western Euro-
pean States. Financially and
scientifically they are likely to
be able to make a big contri-
bution to the discoveries of the
1960’5.”
* * *
“Yorkshire Post” : “It is well
known that there has been
some feeling of frustration
among British scientists as they
contemplated the monopoly of
space enjoyed by the United
States and Russia, and there
was a danger that many of our
young men might be tempted
to take-up research-posts in
the United States. The Govern-
ment’s scheme will bring
encouragement to the many
able research-teams who are
working in Britain.”
The Shah in Britain
'T'hree editorial comments on
the Shah of Persia’s official
visit to the U.K.:
London “New Statesman” :
“The object of this ostentatious
vulgarity [the State reception]
is one Shahanshah (‘King of
Kings’) Pahlavi, the son of a
military adventurer who, 34
years ago, elbowed his way to
the throne of Persia. In 1953,
fearing rough treatment at the
hands of his subjects, he
scuttled out of Tehran and

was later reimposed following
a military coup arranged by
the State Department. He now
rules nearly 20-million people,
thanks to a large Army, the
most efficient secret police-
force in the Middle East and a
team of F. 8.1. ‘advisers.’
“Despite vast and growing oil-
royalties, Persia has on its
own admission—a 60 per cent,
illiteracy rate. It has dire
poverty and oppressed minor-
ities. The press is gagged. The
only mass political party, the
Tudeh, is banned, many of its
leaders dead or in prison. The
main interest of the King of
Kings, who has won a
spuriously ‘progressive’ reputa-
tion by giving away some of
his less lucrative estates, is
money: characteristically, on
his way to London, he stopped-
off in Switzerland to check-up
.on his safe-deposits.”
* * *
The same: “Doubtless the
Queen takes no pleasure in hob-
nobbing with this unsavory
potentate ; as a good civil
servant, she is merely doing her
duty. It is the system which
imposes the duty that is at
fault. A nation, of course,
cannot always choose its allies ;
it may sometimes be necessary
to form ties with a Government
whose principles evoke horror.
If so, the arrangement should
be kept to essentials. It is both
hypocritical and corrupting to
attempt, as in this case, to place
it on the basis of mutual friend-
ship and esteem.
“The Queen symbolises the
British people. How many
millions in Asia and Africa —
whose friendship we really
need will conclude from
accounts of these junketings
that our nation as a whole
endorses a system which to
them stands for all that they
hate and are determined to
end?”
* * *
Edinburgh “Scotsman”: “The
visit of the Shah of Persia to
this country has been preceded
by a violent Russian propa-
ganda campaign against him.
The reason for these attacks
was the failure of negotiations
for a Russo-Persian non-aggres-
sion pact last February, and the
subsequent defence-agreeme'nt
between Persia and the United
States. Persia thus committed
herself more heavily to the
West, and the United States be-
came more heavily committed
to supporting Persia than per-
haps had been intended. It
was, indeed, widely suggested
that the Persian purpose in
embarking on negotiations with
the Russians was to precipitate
a far-reaching agreement with
the U.S.
“The security of Persia, how-
ever, depends much less on
foreign alliances —apart from
the simple guarantee of defence
from military aggression which
she has long enjoyed—than on
internal progress and the rais-
ing of the standard of living of
the masses.
“The Shah has given every
sign of realising this. The per-
sonal gesture of distributing his
own vast lands has not been
followed on any material scale
by other landlords, but a good
start has been made with eco-
nomic development, agricul-
tural and industrial, and the
improvement of public services.
Fiscal and social reform have
also gone some way, though
not yet very far.
“The crucial questions are,
however, whether the- virtual
economic revolution on which
Persia has embarked can be
accomplished without political
revolution, and whether the

Yorkshire Post: “The Shah
has ranged himself whole-
heartedly in the Western camp.
This has taken a good deal of
pluck and resolution to bring
off ; and it is a tribute to his
recovered prestige and
authority that he has done so
with very few outward signs
of dissent in his country at
large. Persia has been a
member of the Baghdad Pact
through all its vicissitudes, and
membership of the Pact is a
cornerstone of her foreign and
defence policy.
“In internal policy the Shah
has moved courageously and
steadily along the path of
reform. What Persia needs now
is a long period of stability
within and security along her
frontiers in order to consoli-
date and extend this policy of
reform, socially, economically
and politically. Her strategic
importance on the perimeter
of the Western world’s defence-
system hardly needs to be
stressed. A free Persia, safe
from Communist aggression or
infiltration, would be a friend
as well as an asset. The West,
and especially Britain, should
not be niggardly or unimagina-
tive in any efforts to maintain
and strengthen that friendship
on terms of mutual respect and
trust.”
Forgotten Crisis
Tn the fevers of the Berlin
crisis, the Iraqi revolt, the
Nyasaland riots and the
Tibetan uprising, the Quemoy-
Matsu dispute appears to have
been forgotten. But should it
be forgotten?
In a letter to “New York
Times” Nathaniel Peffer,
Emeritus Professor of Inter-
national Relations at Columbia
University (U.S.A.), writes :
“A few months ago the
Chinese Communists were
heavily shelling the offshore
islands day by day. Against the
possibility of what seemed im-
minent invasion we sent heavy
reinforcements of ships, planes
and men, presumably to fortify
Formosa, possibly to defend
the islands themselves. And so
we stood, we and the Com-
munist Chinese, confronting
each other for weeks. Had a
shell accidentally sunk an
American ship, or a reckless
Chinese pilot deliberately sunk
one, we should have been at
war with China—Russia sup-
porting China as its ally.
Possibly world war could have
been avoided, but not probably.
“Then for some reason best
known to themselves the
Chinese, or the Chinese
and Russians jointly,
decided to call-off the bombard-
ment (because they thought
Berlin offered better pros-
pects?) and the danger passed.
But has it passed for good?
“Surely no one can believe
that the Chinese Communists
will permanently consent to
islands within swimming-dis-
tance of their shore being
garrisoned by some 80,000
hostile Nationalist troops
equipped with American arms.
Sooner or later, perhaps after
the Berlin issue has been settled
or compromised and the Com-
munist bloc deems it advis-
able to keep America off-
balance, the Communists will
bombard the islands again.
“Whether or not this time
they intend to press the attack
and actually invade the islands,
we shall confront the same situ-
ation as last time. Again we
shall have to send reinforce-
ments. Plainly we cannot yield,
once the issue has been precipi-
tated. To retreat under fire is
to invite attack elsewhere, quite
likely in South-east Asia. And
this time the accident may
happen, or a deliberate attack
may be launched on American
ships, and we shall have the
war.
“Must this be? Can it not be
avoided? After we first made
the treaty with Formosa we
stood by and let Chiang Kai-
shek send a large force into the
islands. Then we did nothing
while he reinforced them. After
the narrow escape last year we
still did nothing, and every-
thing is as it was.
“There is only one course
recommended by commonsense
and our better judgment.
Neither the majority of the
military nor the Congress nor
public opinion considers the
preservation of these islands in
Chiang Kai-shek’s hands worth
a major war, especially now
when such a war would leave
Europe open to Russia.
“We should do now what
we have neglected to do before.
Now, while the dangerous
situation has subsided and we
would not seem to be acting
under pressure, we had better
persuade Chiang Kai-shek,
privately but firmly, to evacuate
the offshore islands, making
use of the fact that Formosa
exists by our sufferance.
“He can save face by
announcing that he is doing
so voluntarily, in order to make
Formosa an impregnable
Gibraltar. Then we shall not
find ourselves in a position in
which we do not W'ant to remain
and from which we cannot
extricate ourselves. Then we
shall not run the risk of
a war we do not want to
fight and which few in this
country and none at all
among our ' Western allies
think is worth fighting or is
in a cause that can be justi-
fied.”
Soviet Scientists'
Wages
“New York Times”:
“The favored economic
position of Soviet scientists has
often been cited as a key reason
for Moscow’s rapid scientific
advance. In a country where


the average monthly wage of
a worker is under $lOO, Soviet
scientists enjoy comfortable
apartments, servants, cars,
country homes and the like.
The Kremlin, it has been clear,
has not stinted in providing in-
centives for .its creative scien-
tific minds. x
“Russians being human, of
course, this favored treatment
has aroused resentment and
envy among the great majority
of Soviet citizens who are not
scientists. That envy is part
of the broader resentment
against the Soviet ‘new class’
which has been such an un-
mistakable feature of post-
Stalin Russia. Now, our
Moscow correspondent re-
ports, steps are to be taken to
make scientists a less favored
group and to make more
certain that economic rewards
correspond to actual achieve-
ment rather than merely to
possession of academic degrees.
“It should be an interesting
experiment, but the question
must arise about other favored
groups in Soviet society as well.
We may wonder if anything
has been done to lessen the
gap between the living-stand-
ards of the Communist-party
bosses and their people. That
gap, we may be sure, far ex-
ceeds any margin the Soviet
scientists enjoy.”
German Unity
Tn the course of a lengthy
article written for London
“Sunday- Times” after a visit
to Germany, Hugh Trevor-
Roper, Regius Professor of
Modern History at Oxford
University, drops a few
thoughts on the German atti-
tude towards unification of the
country:
“Naturally the Germans
themselves are deeply sensitive
about their present partition.
The East Germans have shown
their feelings clearly enough.
Two-million of them have
voluntarily fled to the West.
There were rebellions against
the Russians in 1953. And no
one doubts that free elections
in East Germany now would
mean the end of the ‘Pankow
Government.’
‘‘it is for this reason that the
West has consistently demand-
ed ‘free all-German elections’
as the basis of reunion ; and it
is for the same reason that the
Russians have as consistently
refused them. As Mr. Khrush-
chev put it, ‘elections show the
majority, not the truth.’
“On the other hand the
Germans, too, are a practical
people, and they, too, are ready,
for the time being, to compro-
mise on what they can get. They
cannot openly say so, of course.
But, in fact, they are not too
unhappy.
“Unity may be an ideal, but
while things are going well,
and the ‘Economic Miracle’
lasts, Bavarians .have no great
desire to be bossed by Prussians,
Western Catholics to be out-
numbered by Eastern
Lutherans, Rhineland indus-
trialists to be faced by the old
radicalism of Berlin or the new
Marxism of the ‘Democratic
Republic.’ Even in the
Federal Ministry of All-
German affairs, which exists to
overcome the division of Ger-
many, I was given to under-
stand that that division is the
solution which —at present —
divides Germans, as it divides
everyone else, the least.
“ ‘At present’ . . . But how
long can we presume that the
present will last? We cannot
exclude the possibility that it
may last very long, perhaps
even become permanent. Make-
shifts and deadlocks sometimes
do. Some of the most per-
manent frontiers in Europe are
as artificial as the division of
Germany. Diplomatic and
military deadlock, and oppo-
site social systems have made
out of the once-united Nether-
lands two obstinately separate
States ; and there is no in-
herent reason why the same
should not happen in Germany,
when time has worn-out the
memory of unity.
“But although this may yet
happen, it would be quite
wrong to presume upon it now.
The present equilibrium in
Germany is not natural.: it is
caused by an interlocking of
pressures, any one of which, if
relaxed, might cause a fatal dis-
location. And these pressures
are not necessarily constant.
“The balance of power be-
tween the Nato and the Warsaw
Powers can change. There can
be more revolts in the East.
The ‘Economic Miracle' may
wane in the West. If the
pressure for rational reunifica-
tion is relaxed, the cry for irra-
tional reunification may grow
dangerously loud: already
there is an idiot-fringe in West
Germany demanding not
merely reunion but the re-
covery of forfeit conquests in
Poland and Bohemia. A slump
might even bring such men to
power.
“And then, if we renounce
our old hope of reunion with
the liberal West, may not our
deserted friends seek reunion
even with the illiberal East?
All these are possibilites which
forbid us to say that the
division either will or should
be permanent.”
Faith in the
Future
As winter comes and days grow shorter, the
months of 1959 add on: soon we will be at the
end of another financial year.
It is a year in which we can count our
blessings in the midst of a broad, general
prosperity. The economy holds sound. Wool prices
have taken an upward turn, and wool exports
are higher.
An American market has opened for our
meat. The over-all farm income this year will
be considerably greater than was estimated.
Business flourishes, the share and finance market
is buoyant. Factories increase in number and in
the diversity of their output.
The adverse trade balance—expected now to
be very substantially less than was figured in
estimate early in the financial year—is offset by a
strong flow of overseas capital for investment in
our country.
Every State has its own story of advancement
to tell.
First major-supply of high-voltage power from
the giant Snowy hydro-electric scheme has been
connected to the central grid system in New
South Wales.
Final negotiations are being made with the
World Bank for a £22-million loan to reconstruct
the Townsville - Mount Isa railway in North
Queensland —a project complementary to the great
and expanding enterprise which promises to make
Mount Isa one of the leading copper producers
of the world.
Along with this northern development goes
the production of uranium at Mary Kathleen nine
months ahead of schedule, and the big bauxite
operations in plan in Cape York Peninsula.
These are only a few of the signs that Australia
now is in a cycle of tremendous, powerful growth.
The scene is altogether a happy one to survey.
The Future is to be glimpsed in what is
unfolding. The Faith in Australia which this
inspires is reflected in what the year records. And
with these two gathering forces working one upon
the other to impel our Australian effort, the years
of our rise to full national greatness can be said
to have truly begun.

Another favorite for singing
was:
While the old man was chasing his
son round the room
He was chasing his son round the
room,
And while he was chasing his son
round the room
He was chasing his son round the
room.
And, of course, there was the
bawdy
There was an old woman and she
could do,
She could do, she could do.
These two lines were sung over
and over until someone asked
what the old woman could do,
whereupon he would be told,
in a line which concluded
. . and so can you.”
A mong the rhymed games
that adults expected us to
play at parties was “Sheep,
sheep, come home.” 1 still
occasionally h<jar the chorus:
Wolf’s gone to Devonshire
And won’t be home for seven year,
So run, sheep, run,
but rarely since my own boy-
hood have I heard that other,
Here comes an old woman from
Botany Bay,
And what have you got to give her
today.
(In fact, I’ve even forgotten
how the game was played.)
Grown-ups, needless to say,
did not approve of that far
more popular party-chant,
Ice - cream and jelly,
Good for the belly.
A popular rhyme that came
to us from adults was
“Mother, may I go to bathe ?”
“Yes, my darling daughter;
Hang your ciothes on yonder bush,
But don't go near the water.’’
I don’t think it was the
manifest ridiculousness of this
rhyme that made it such a
favorite with us. To us it was
not ridiculous ; we saw in it
a clear demonstration of that
tyrannical illogicality of adults
which makes so difficult the
lives of children. It was prob-
ably our unspoiled child’s view
of the world, too, that made
a debased version of “The
Great Rock Candy Mountains”
popular with us. I think that
to us a land in which no one
had to change his socks, and
where everyone could drink
freely at the lemonade-springs,
was a true embodiment of
everything Heaven should be.
'T'here were a number of
counting-rhymes, some of
which, I hear, are still in use.
Of the respectable ones, I can
remember only “Eenie-meenie.”
This was used when there were,
say, too many boys present to
share in a distribution of
stolen oranges. At each syl-
lable of the rhyme the speaker
would point to a different boy:
Eenie-meenie, miney, mo,
Catch a nigger by the toe.
If he hollows let him go,
Eenie-meenie, miney, mo,
And out you go.
Whichever boy was pointed to
at the word go would be
excluded from the distribution
of the treasures, and the pro-
cess would be repeated until
the number was reduced to the
appropriate point. The count-
ing was supposed to be done
in strict rotation, but a skilful
and unscrupulous reciter often
managed to protect the
interests of himself and his
mates. There was also the
unpleasant
Ink, pink, pen and ink;
I smell a great big stink,
, And it comes from Y-O-U.
This was used as a sort of
magical method of revealing
who had produced a certain
kind of unpleasantness which
always raises mirth in immature
minds.
I rarely see the
rhymes that we used to
scribble on the walls of public
lavatories.
Of course, I haven’t much
chance of discovering if many
of the sooty rhymes of my
youth are still remembered.
However, when I unthinkingly
quoted the first line of “Mary
and the Magpie” in front of a
couple of lads the other day,
and their faces showed no
flicker of, recognition, I
assumed that even that old
classic has fallen out of use.
I don’t know if the poem
we used to attribute to Byron
is still going. It began:
On Shooter’s Hill so high and steep
A fair young maid lay down to
sleep,
And as she lay in sweet repose
A playful breeze blew up her
clothes.
I suspect that two old
favorites, “Can’t you see the
blisters?” and “When we were
boys at school,” have dropped
from use. However, I gather
that many of the old adult
limericks still circulate among
schoolboys.
They may also still cherish
“Our old moke is a funny old
bloke.”
1 feel that “Fisherman,
fisherman” was perhaps too
long to live on through the
years. It had a catchy tune,
and opened with two innocuous
stanzas:
Fisherman, fisherman, fishing by the
sea,
Have you any fish that you can sell
to me.
With a hi-tiddeley-hi-ti, come along
o’ me,
Hi-tiddeley-hi-ti, Johnson.
He bought a fish for which he paid
a cent,
He put it in his pocket, and home
he went,
With a hi-tiddeley-hi-ti, come along
o’ me,
Hi-ticldeley-hi-ti, Johnson.
There were several long ones,
too, about sailors. There was
“The Fair Young Maiden and
Bollocky Bill,” and one that
described the betrayal of
another maiden, whose seducer
told her that if the incident led
to the birth of a son she was to
“dress him in bell-bottoms and
a little coat of blue.”
I imagine that our old secret
language, “ichy-way oz-way
oken-spay ike-lay iss-thay”
(i.e., “which was spoken like
this”) has gone, and the other
day I found a juvenile audience
none of whom knew the
formula
YYUR
YYUB
1C UR
YY4ME
which is, decoded,
Too wise you are,
Too wise you be,
1 see you are
Too wise for me.
However, I hope that some
of the old parodies still
enliven the after-school hours
of lads today. For my money
the bobby-dazzler among them
all was:
Oh, dear, what can the matter be,
Three old ladies locked _ in the
lavatory . . .
A h, well —who knows —the
falling out of use of these
childhood rhymes may have a
beneficial effect on the adult
poetry of the future. At
present many poets of what
are thought to be mature years
compose their work much in
the forms used by the school-
boy lyricists. Juvenile verse
of the type we have been dis-
cussing, also, can have an
effect on adult speech, perhaps
even on grown-up thought-
processes. About 10 years ago
some latter-day lower-school
Herrick composed a lyric that
went almost like this:
See you later,
Chip potater,
Burn your tail On the radiator,
And freeze your nose in the
Kelvinator.
A few years later the press
of the world published the
thrilling news that the mem-
bers of an overseas smart-set
were demonstrating their
sophistication and originality
of mind by saying to each
other,
See you later,
Alligator.
Gosh, how the kids must have
sneered to see a third-form
expression of their obsession
with rhyme being so debased!
And think of the effect of the
plagiarism on the juvenile
author of the original! Why,
it may even have caused some
trauma that has stilled for ever
the jingling voice of one who
would otherwise have devel-
oped into an A. D. Hope of
years to come.

of fearsome yelling had the
constabulary cocking their
Enfields ; then Malil and
Lamu marched in, volubly self-
satisfied, and accompanied by
six more Mokolkol men, all
unarmed. We gave them an
enthusiastic welcome. They
immediately asked for axes.
r TME next four hours were
given over to mutual
admiration, interlarded with
official exhortations, reassur-
rances, and the distribution of
presents, including axe-heads.
At first, despite a show of
nonchalance, as befitted war-
riors, they obviously felt that
they were taking a tremendous
risk ; they smiled readily, but
their muscles were tense and
their eyes roamed unceasingly
about the camp. The flutter-
ing stomach-pulses—always a
telltale sign—betrayed the sup-
pressed excitement. At least
within living memory, this was
the first amicable intercourse
Mokolkols had ever conducted
with strangers.
The ice was broken when I
presented Manu’s husband,
named Mulau, an impressively
rugged man of dignified mien,
with a new three-quarter axe,
complete with hickory handle,
and having a sharp, polished
blade. His reunion with his
wife and family had amounted
to one or two casual grunts,
but the axe proved too much
for Mokolkol reserve. - The
wild men patted it lovingly,
laughing gaily and chattering
at frantic speed in their high-
pitched, unpleasantly nasal
dialect.
Then Mulau tested the blade
by taking some tremendous
swings at a tree. After a few
others had done likewise they
sat down, and we conversed,
painfully, of many things. But
this particular axe was
much more attractive than
any official discourse. At
intervals, as though succumb-
ing to sheer rapture, one of
the Mokolkols would leap up,
seize the tool, and try a few
more strokes. 1 Unlike most
primitives, they were remark-
ably proficient axemen, arid
after an hour I began to view
some of the overhanging
timber with a wary eye.
Chris took out a flat file, and
began to demonstrate its use
as a sharpener. This swiftly
drew shocked protests, and the
axe-edge was again examined,
anxiously, for signs of damage.
I reverted again to the subject
of raiding.
“We won’t raid any more,”
they said ; “not when we now
know where the axes come
from.”
/"Vur guests seemed not
entirely unaware of their
own notoriety. They carefully
examined the interpreters and
carriers for scars, and when
they found some, asked
smilingly: “Did we do that to
you?”
In all these affairs of State
the chief spokesman and
master - of - ceremonies was
Malil, the expert on white
culture, and the leader who
had organised this highly
profitable rapprochment. He
said that he had located his
triends near the Sai River head-
waters, and 'added, as though
it was a great jest, that he had
travelled without sleep for
three days.
Just how many miles his
search had taken him, what
sort of account he had given
of his odyssey, and what argu-
ments he had used to persuade
the wild men to come down
to us, could only be con-
jectured, for Malil was far too
busily engaged to reminisce.
We strongly suspected that his
clinching argument concerned
our fabulous wealth in axes —-
lures for which the band was
prepared to dare much.
Gesticulating vigorously, his
face sweaty with fatigue, the
luluai’s cap perched askew on
the back of his woolly head,
and his huge betel-red mouth
working overtime, he enjoyed
his triumph to the full, and
remained always in command
of the situation. It was Malil,
possibly fearful that an inscrut-
able Government might wish
to replenish its Mokolkol stocks
from the new material avail-
able, who swiftly vetoed the
idea of any of the new men
accompanying us back to the
coast. Because of our gener-
osity, he said, they haa too
much to carry home ; besides,
the women —they were prob-
ably lurking nearby —could not
be left for long unprotected.
"IX/E were interested to learn
the easiest route up the
confused system of spurs and
ridges, so proposed that we all
go to Atar. Malil demurred,
explaining, not unreasonably,
that the gardens were now
overgrown and the houses in
ruins.
“Give us time to rebuild
Atar, and then we will cut a
road to the salt-water, so you
can come and visit us without
trouble, and I will give you
taro to eat because you are my
friends.”
So saying, he threw down
his axe, straightened his cap,
gave a grotesque parody of a
poli c e m a n’s salute, and
embraced everyone within
reach. A splendid perform-
ance, indicating genuine talent.
It was plain that our friends
were keen to be off, and that
any further persistence on our
part would rekindle suspicions
regarding our intentions. So
we parted, swearing eternal
friendship.
The Mokolkols have not
raided since.

THE MIRROR
The mirror has abolished cedar frame.
It is oval. And cool. And blue at its
edges. It is like water between red trees.
In the mirror, pink cyclamen tumble from
my lap and fall into the water of the
mirror. And there they go. Drifting, with
all the delicate precision of swans, through
glass that is like water shining between
red trees: Until far away. And quite out of
the reach of my reflected hands.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
valuations as well as reduce
them if it thinks fit, but there’s
no record of its ever having
given costs against an unsuc-
cessful appellant.
The long delay in hearing
appeals has also been a big
factor in inducing landowners
to withdraw them ; but with-
drawals are bad tactics. The
next general valuation will be
in 1961, when, if the present
trend continues, another steep
rise may be expected. The
only ones likely to get off
lightly in 1961 are those who,
in the meantime, have made
soundly based appeals against
Soaring Land Values
One doesn't have to inquire
very deeply into the recent
boom in land-values in N.S.W.
to discover that it’s due almost
wholly to the 1957 valuations
of the V.-G.’s Department.
Many people who received
their valuation-notices early in
1958 seemed unaware at first
that that year's local-govern-
ment rating would be based on
the new and much higher
values ; and it was only when
they saw their assessments from
local councils that they realised
how hard the new valuations
would hit them.
Some councils, of course,
reduced their rates, and so kept
the liability of ratepayers on
the same level as before ; but
others held to the old rating
(and in some cases increased
it), thus adding greatiy to the
financial burden of their rate-
payers.
When the 1959 assessments
came out and landowners
found they were again liable for
substantial payments, they felt,
the only way to get their
money back was to put higher
reserve-prices on land offered
for sale ; and to justify this
they triumphantly produced the
V.-G.’s 1957 valuation.
I know of several cases
where the 1957 valuation was
about 100 per cent, above the
1954 figure ; and soon after the
1957 valuation was issued the
owners added another 20 per
cent, to the figure and made it
the reserve-price on the land.
This might have been fair in
cases where street-improve-
ments and better transport-
services justified it; but the
principle was also adopted by
owners whose land wasn’t a
bit better served than three
years before.
I don’t know of any action
■which has had such an in-
flationary effect as this 1957
increase in land-valuations.
Unfortunately many home-
owners have been bluffed into
withdrawing their appeals
against the valuations for fear
they 11 have the court-costs
awarded against them should
the appeal be unsuccessful. It's
true that the Land Valuation
Court has power to increase
“ H-m-mm! Butterflies in the stomach: one dose of
insecticide daily.”
the 1957 valuations. They may
not get a reduction in the 1957
figure, but they may influence
the V.-G.’s Department against
any further steep increase in
values—M.F.D. (N.S.W.).
Voltaire and Religion
That Voltaire did make some
approach towards Catholicism
at the end of his life, though
denied by “Bon Chat” (B.
20/5/’59), would seem to be
well attested to. In Alfred
Noyes’s biography many pages
are devoted to this point, but
on p. 587 he quotes in full a
declaration which seems to
settle the matter:
I, the undersigned, declare that,
having been attacked four days ago
by a vomiting of blood, at the age
of 84 and being unable to get to
church, the cure of Saint Sulplice
having been willing to add to his
work that of sending me the Abbe
Gaultier, priest, 1 have' confessed
to him; and declare further that, if
God disposes of me, I die in the
Catholic religion in which I was
born, hoping from the divine mercy
that He will deign to pardon all
my faults, and that if I ever scan-
dalised the Church, I ask pardon
of God and of it. Signed Voltaire,
2nd March, 1778, in the house of
the Marquis de Villette, in the
presence of the Abbe Mignot, my
nephew, and of the Marquis de
Villevielle, my friend.
-—Martin Haley (Q.).
Dumping Rubbish
The person who dumps rub-
bish by the side of urban roads
has been pretty widely, and
quite rightly, abused. His
action’is selfish and anti-social.
On the other hand, many local
authorities could do much
more than they do to
encourage the dumping of
rubbish in the right places.
Most local councils leave
their tips open to the public,
but some appear to go to great
lengths to frustrate people who
want to do the right thing.
There is a public tip near my
home, but no one may use it
without a permit from the
council. No request for a
permit is ever refused, but to
get one you have to spend
hours finding a parking-place
within walking-distance of the
council office. The officers who
issue permits have no idea why
permits are necessary.
Another council charges a
fee for use of its tip—it would
seem more logical to pay
people to bring their rubbish
along. At another tip the
attendant collects a fee, but
issues no receipts. And I
know of one country tip on the
gate of which there is the father
of all padlocks.
It would seem that if a man
is willing to dump his rubbish
in the place provided for it
the local council should do all
it can to help him. If it puts
obstacles in his path, it cannot
rightly complain if he refuses
to fight against them. —-

Rocket Expenditure
Heavy expenditure on rocket-
research and other aspects of
defence (B. 13/5/'59) is un-
fortunately necessary to coun-
teract Russian activity in these
fields. If the money we now
spend on rockets were diverted
to economic aid for underde-
veloped countries it would no
doubt weaken the appeal of
Communism in those countries,
but it would not remove the
Communist menace. If the
Russians got well ahead of the
free world in military equip-
ment —particularly in rocketry
—they would have it at their
mercy. —Lyle (N.S.W.).
Super-silence
There is to be super-silence
at the Melbourne Town Hall
shortly. Some 270yds. „ of
carpet, costing £BOO, is to be
laid along the aisles ; and 1788
group-type steel chairs, costing
£10,128, will replace the old
wooden ones which used to
complain of the audience
almost as bitterly as the critics
have lately been complaining
of the performances.
What is more important is
that orchestra and conductors
will now have a better go with-
out having to contend with
these extraneous noises.
There has been severe
criticism of the subscription-
concerts lately. There has been
an alarming decrease in the
number of subscribers, and
various explanations for it are
being advanced, some not of
the gentlest nature.
One reason given is that the
orchestra today is third-rate
and not a patch on the orches-
tra of 1944, when it was classed
as one'of the world's best. It
is claimed that inter-State and
overseas orchestras got away
with some of Melbourne’s best
musicians, that promotion
within the orchestra is by
seniority rather than by talent,
and that the present organisa-
tion is dominated by super-
annuated mediocrities —in fact,
the situation is said to be so
bad that no first-rate conductor
will stick with the orchestra
for more than a few concerts.
If true, this is a serious
indictment. But is it true?
Are there fewer skilled
musicians in the orchestra
today than there were in 1944?
Could orchestral leader Bertha
Jorgensen be described by any
stretch of the imagination as
mediocre? Harry Hutchens is

no slouch of a second-violinist
either. Several overseas con-
ductors have given high praise
to the work of the woodwind
section. Flautist Richard
Chugg is generally thought to
be in world ' class; so is
clarinetist Thomas White,
while his brother Roy seems to
know one end of a French-
horn from the other. Violinist
Paul McDermott not only
plays in the orchestra but runs
a very fine ensemble of his own
creation, and if Jiri Tanci-
budek got his position on
seniority he still makes extra-
ordinarily beautiful noises
come out of his oboe.
It is a fact, of course, that
sometimes the orchestra will
give a spiritless performance
under one conductor; but a
couple of weeks later, under a
new conductor, it will give a
show that seems inspired. This
doesn’t indicate that the orches-
tra lacks skill or talent ; it
simply indicates that some con-
ductors can bring out the best
in an orchestra and others
can’t.
Old concert-subscribers were
recently asked why they had
become non-subscribers. Some
replied that it was either TV
or the rising cost of baby-
sitters. None of them admitted
it was boredom ; but boredom
it is, in my opinion;
Where are the ardent young
music-lovers of yesteryear who
night after night listened to the
finest music by the greatest
masters? Goodness knows ;
but listening to music without
making music, like gawking at
pictures without painting any,
has bored them so completely
that you couldn’t get them to
another concert if you paid
them. The orchestra could
hardly be blamed for this
glorious consummation of their
efforts, and super-silence isn’t
likely to change it for the
better. —M. G. S. (Vic.).
Understaffed Schools
The remarks of “Pat” (B.
6/5/’59) prompt me to con-
fess that I, a schoolmaster,
have learnt far more by teach-
ing than I succeeded in learn-
ing as a pupil for six years at
an English public school and
in my subsequent years at the
university. *
I can hardly believe it pos-
sible that the Madras system
has been introduced into the
school mentioned except by
some sort of accident, for no
local educational authority
would have either the wisdom
or the courage to introduce it
deliberately. There is, in fact,
no better way for a youngster
to appreciate just what educa-
tion is all about than to stand
on his hind-legs before a class
and teach.
The headmaster of one of
England’s public schools told
me recently that he always
hands-over the teaching assign-
ment in the school (a large one)
to his Sixth-form at the end
of the year, so that they may
- realise how little they (the sixth-
formers) know.
I think it was Shaw who
said: “Those who can, do
....Those who can't, teach.”
There is some truth in it, too.
Lots of teachers lack the real
art of communication; but if
you can achieve it, then you
can do.
Apart from all this, of
course, a boy or girl teacher is
more nearly on the communi-
cation-level of the pupils. As
things are nowadays, about 75
per cent, of all words uttered
by teachers in .classrooms in
this country go clean through
the receiving-apparatus of the
pupils without encountering
anything on the way in the
form of understanding, re-
buttal, inquiry, or translation.
-Sir (Q.).
Barristers and Solicitors
The necessity of engaging a
solicitor to conduct a person-
ally important though purely
routine legal chore made a
sizeable assault on my bank-
balance. But, healthy though
the bill was, I consider myself
lucky that the job was purely a
solicitor’s and didn't require a
barrister as well. My sympathy
goes to those who have to pay
solid fees to each of these
legal eagles when one alone
could do the job.
Before the turn of this
century the Victorian Parlia-
ment amalgamated the pro-
fessions of barrister and
solicitor. It was argued then
that the community would be
saved costs through one man
doing the two jobs. Accord-
ingly, lawyers were, and still
are, at least in Victoria, regis-
tered as barristers and solicitors
with appropriate status.
You might think that if the
cost-to-the-community argu-
ment was sound 60-odd yeajs
ago it would apply with equal
validity today, yet in practice
the two professions have never
amalgamated. Nowadays in
Melbourne less than a score of
solicitors don wig and gown in
the role of court advocates, the
remainder being only too glad
to operate in the lucrative field
of legal administrators and
advisers.
This very effective legal
“trade-union” goes a little
further. In civil or criminal
cases involving Queen’s Coun-
sel the solicitor instructs not
one barrister but two the
Q.C. and his junior. In such
cases the client is really for
it. He can’t have his solicitor
complete his case, nor can he
engage counsel direct, thereby
eliminating the solicitor’s ser-
vices. There are three fees to
pay, and, win or lose, they’re
bound to be substantial.
Obviously the law must have
its specialists. Every solicitor
legally entitled to represent a
-client directly and finally in
court may not be competent to
do so. But can it be denied
that many are both able and
entitled to do the job in the
legal interest of the client and
his pocket? As for the Q.C.,
it’s difficult to see why he must
be supported by an assistant-
barrister plus an instructing
solicitor in order to give
efficient ser v i c e. — Xavier

Cracking the Bodgie
The suggestion that we
should “crack-down hard on
the bodgie” (B. 29/4/’59)
strikes me as a strange remedy
for. social maladjustment.
These anti-social youths are
third- or fourth-generation
products of our tax-supported
educational plant. Surely it is
up to the Department of Edu-
cation in each State to find out
what has gone wrong with its
machinery, and to make the
necessary readjustments?
Police action will do nothing
to ensure that our State system
of education will not, in the
future, produce such minority
groups again. .
If, in giving treatment, a
doctor were by mischance to
produce such alarming symp-
toms in even one or two of
his patients, would it be rea-
sonable to suggest as a' remedy
that the patients be restored to
normality by exposure to
police violence?
We now know enough about
child-psychology to realise that
anti-social youths of this type
are not the result of a self-
devised pattern of character-
building. And it doesn’t re-
quire much imagination to see
that- the business of being a
bodgie is neither remunerative
nor productive of any degree
of self-satisfaction. These
youths have been caught in a


trap of our devising, and it is
up to us to release them from
that trap —or else put-up with
their unpleasant antics in the
hope that some day they may
grow-up enough to be able to
release themselves. School-
master (Q.).
Monty’s Wanted?
“Aircraft Policy” (B.
13/5/’59) rightly stresses that
if defence-schemes are to have
the full support of the country
it isn't enough for them to be
effective; those who pay for
them must see that they have
a chance to be effective.
With Australia’s limited re-
sources of men and money no
overall scheme of defence can
be effective if the claims of
the three Services are con-
sidered separately or are settled
on the basis of robbing Peter to
pay Paul.
We now have the Mobile
Brigade Group; but it will
never be effective while it’s
hamstrung by having to give
inadequate training to a limited
number of National Service-
men. N.S. training should be
either abolished or changed to
training for civil defence,
which is not a responsibility of
the Regular Army. The in-
creased cost, if any, would be
money well spent.
There are signs that the
“An that's not all—these nights he takes a cold-water
bottle to bed!”
R.A.A.F. is to have first call on
the 12 Hercules transport-air-
craft to ferry R.A.A.F. stores
rather than make the Mobile
Brigade Group really mobile.
Surely there should be an air-
transport wing to meet the de-
mands of the Navy, Army and
Air Force. We now have an
independent' Chairman of the.
Chiefs of Staff Committee who
can decide priorities, and a
Minister of Defence to put the
case to Cabinet. If there aren't
enough Hercules aircraft to
meet essential requirements the
public should be told and asked
to support the purchase of
more.
At a time when no Navy can
claim to be modern unless it
can operate effectively in three
dimensions, there is a sugges-
tion that the R.A.N. dispense
with its aircraft-carriers and
close its air-stations at Nowra
and Schofields. The idea is that
the men and money saved
could be used to increase the
number of anti-submarine
vessels. But in limited wars and
in preventing ihe spread of
brush-fires a Navy must pack
an offensive punch, whether in
the form of strike-aircraft or
helicopter-borne commandos.
This is within the capabilities of
H.M.A.S. Melbourne and
Sydney.
In a global war or its after-
math the chances of survival
of merchant-ships against
modern torpedoes and sub-
marines will be appreciably
lessened without some sort of
air-protection, even if our anti-
submarine flotillas are in-
creased. The R.A.A.F. Nep-
tune bombers—even if all were
available for this purpose—can
provide only a fraction of the
protection afforded by one
carrier of the H.M.A.S. Mel-
bourne type, let alone two.
Pending development of a
robust aircraft capable of a
vertical take-off, hovering and
landing vertically to be
carried in the ships of the anti-
submarine flotillas —we must
make-do with our two carriers.
, At a time of alleged pros-
perity in which costs of service
manpower and materials are
steadily rising, we are spending
less and less on defence in
terms of real money. Whether
this is due to lack of enlist-
ments or lack of resolution and

leadership by the Government
and all concerned is an open
question. If leadership were
strong enough more men would
possibly'respond to the call for
service.
Public opinion can’t be ex-
pected to give answers to the
complex questions of modern

the responsibility of the
Government to inform, educate
and lead. In the absence of
such leadership the need often
produces the man. Australia

Guinea-pig Pupils
Progress' in educational
methods demands that some
pupils be used as guinea-pigs
for new ideas; but such
experiments have drawbacks,
particularly foi the guinea-
pigs.
Last year 6ne of the two
French-teachers at my son's
high-school started teaching by
a new method, based apparently
on the notion that the elements
of a language can be acquired
without hard grind at grammar
or vocabulary. Possibly it’s a
sound idea: many people get
a working-knowledge of a
foreign language in this way,
if they’re compelled to live and
work alongside others speaking
nothing else ; but it’s a
different matter to apply the
method in the limited time
available in a crowded school
curriculum.
Anyway, this teacher’s
results were poor in comparison
with those of the other, who
used the orthodox method ;
nevertheless he's persevering
with his system and with the
same pupils, who this year must
sit for the Intermediate. On
last year’s results, at least half
the experimental class might
fail, as against a very small
percentage of probable failures
in the orthodox class.
This is hardly satisfactory to
the guinea-pig pupils and their
parents. It’s one thing to try-
out a new teaching-method
where results don’t matter very
much ; it’s quite another to
use pupils for experiments
at the end of the year
they must sit for an exam, set
and conducted by outside
examiners. For some students,
failure in French this Decem-
ber may mean failure to get
their Intermediate; and such
a set-back may seriously in-
terrupt their scholastic careers.
There should be closer
“ Well — you've heard the saying. ...”
control over experiments of this
kind, no matter how well-
meaning the teacher concerned
may be. New teaching-methods
should be limited as far as
practicable to classes not
taking exams. —or at least, not
external exams. Where this
isn’t possible the examiners
should make allowance for the
handicaps under which the
guinea-pigs have studied.
Incidentally, some of my
son's mates are getting special
coaching* outside the school —
which means that their exam.-
results will have little or no
bearing on the efficiency of the
new method. — Ardoyne (Vic.).
Septic Systems
While the single-tank-system
seems at last to have received
the blessing of the N.S.W. De-
partment of Health (B.
13/5/’59), to the exclusion of
the noisome septic-closet, it,
too, can be grossly offensive.
My next-door neighbor
installed a single-tank under a
small landing outside his
dining-room door, about 20ft.
from my bedroom windows.
About 12ft. of sanitary-pipes,
set 12in. under the surface
along the dividing-fence, drain
the effluvia from the tank into
a dead-end in the backyard-
no absorption-trench. From
time to time the atmosphere is
charged with overpowering
offensiveness, noticeable par-
ticularly on humid days after
spells of rain.
This, surely, is to be expected
if the conditions prescribed to
exclude offensiveness in the
case of my double-tank system
were justified.
The excavation-site was
30ft. from the house and 60ft.
from the nearer dividing-fence,
with a drain 25ft. long leading
from the tank to a 30ft.-long
and 3ft.-deep absorption-
trench. This necessitated blast-
ing away many cubic-yards of
sandstone.
Plans and specifications pre-
pared by an architect —a
member of the Society of
Sanitary Engineers—were sub-
mitted to the local council,
which, as required, sent them
on to the Government Medical
Officer of Health (80 miles
away), who in turn passed the
buck on to the Department of
Health, Sydney. The docu-
ments came back by the same
route with extensive altera-
tions to the plans (in triplicate)
marked in red-ink and amend-
ments to the specifications
detailed at length. Rather than
provoke a wrangle between
professional men and delay the
building of a much-needed resi-
dence, I gave the job to the
local plumber, who blithely
and without rny knowledge--
until some time later—substi
tuted his own (much simpler)
plan, called-in Mr. Rafferty to
interpret the specifications and
built a septic-tank that has
worked efficie ily and has
never been inspected by the
local health-authority.
The single-tank system might,
do away with a lot of boloney
and expense, provided adequate
provision is made for eliminat-
ing offensive odors.—J S
(N.S.W.).
Hides and Hamburgers
Was amused by “Raw
Material’s” statements about the
price of hides (B. 13/5/’59).
Prices are published regularly.
On May 7 and 14 “Queens-
land Country Life” reported
them as ranging from about
2s. 3d. per lb. for a 601 b. hide
to about 6s. lOd. per lb. for
calf-hides.
I’d say the real trouble with
station hides comes from the
way they’re taken off the
carcass. I’ve seen some that
appeared to have been removed
with an adze. But hides are
the bane of the meat-trade,
and bad skinning happens even
among skilled tradesmen work-
ing under keen supervision.
What chance has a rousy with
a blunt knife and crude
slaughtering arrangements?- -
Bill the Nark (Q.).


It is a sobering thought
that our country’s
economy depends to a
very large extent on the
price we can obtain for
our wool. Sheep-
owners throughout Aus-
tralia have been grati-
fied by the recent
improvement in wool
prices and confidently
expect these improve-
ments to continue.

There is no doubt that

are less prone to

SHEARING-TALLIES
From G. B. EDGERTON
TThe “New Zealand Herald”
(2/1/’59) claims a world
shearing-record for Trevor
Brough, of Okaihau, who on
New Year's Eve shore 501
Cheviot-Romney-cross ewes in
a nine-hour working-day and
is reported to have broken the
previous record of 457 estab-
lished in December, 1953, by
Ivan Bowen, also of New Zea-
land. A Bulletin reader, con-
sidering this claim exaggerated,
asked for a comparison be-
tween shearing-records and
conditions in Australia and
New Zealand.
There are no official records
kept in Australia. The only
figures available are those of
claims sent into newspapers
and other interested bodies.
So when making comparison
between Australia and New
Zealand there are many aspects
which must be taken into
account.
In Australia the predominant
breed is the Merino, with
dense staple-formation and a
large amount of development,
or wrinkle, which makes shear-
ing more difficult. Sheep in
New Zealand, however, are
predominately Crossbred or
English longwool, with sparse
staple-formation and plain
conformation. This allows the
hand-piece to be pushed
through the wool with a mini-
mum of resistance. In New
Zealand the comb-and-cutter
used is 1| times as wide as the
standard comb-and-cutter used
in Australia. This greatly re-
duces the time taken to shear
a sheep, especially a Cross-
bred, where a full cut could be
taken all the time. However,
the wide comb-and-cutter can-
not be used in Australia be-
cause the dense wool-staple
makes it too hard to push the
hand-piece through the fleece.
The generally accepted Aus-
tralian record for Merino sheep
stands to the credit of Jacky
“The emphasis these days is on personal ease and
comfort .”
Howe, who on Monday,
October 10, 1892, at Alice
Downs, near Blackall (Q.),
shore 321 sheep in 7hr. 40min.
This feat was accomplished
with blades, and has never been
beaten with machines, although
Jimmy Power, in 1893, shore
315 at Barenya (Q.) in 7hr.
20min. It was generally
accepted at the time that had
more sheep been available,
Power should probably have
beaten Howe’s record. Power’s
machine-record stood until
1909, when Dan Cooper shore
316 sheep in the full 8-hour day
at Bundooran (Q.).
Few shearers have shorn
over 300 Merino sheep in a
day. The writer could find
reference only to Frank Lewis
and Frank Vernan, who both
shore' 300. In 1928, at Dalgety
Downs (W.A.), Bob Sowallish
shore 304, and, at Three Rivers
(W.A.), Harry Finlay shore
301 in a day. Thirty-one
shearers at Goonoo Goonoo
(N.S.W.), in 1925, averaged 204
sheep a man in 7hr. 20min. The
highest tally was 305.
As can be seen, the big
tallies in Australian sheds were
set late last century or early
in this century. This points to
the probability that sheep in
those days did not produce as

much wool as they do nowa-
days, especially on the , belly
and points.
As no official record is kept,
it is impossible to find out
what has been the highest tally
in recent years. However, some
of the best tallies in Merino
sheep (all in N.S.W.), recorded
by Grazcos Co-operative, Ltd.,
are: M. Thomas, in 1949, at
Kurrajong, 230, and, in 1957,
at Nocoleche, 224 ; D. T. (Des)
Campbell, in 1951, at Bangate,
253, and, in 1952, at Llanillo,

in 1951, at Boolcarrol, 226.
George Whittaker shore 362
large Crossbred lambs in an
8-hour day and in one run of

Getting back to Trevor
Brough’s record day, it must be
pointed out that the conditions
in which he established his
record are d fferent from the
conditions under which sheep
are shorn , in Australia. Brough
started his day at 5.30 a.m. and
shore his sheep in nine separate
one-hour runs, with a break
after each hour, whereas under
Australian conditions he would
only have had a break after
every two hours. His tallies for
each of the nine one-hour runs
were: 55, 57, 57, 57, 55, 54, 55,
58, 53.
In Australia the standard
working-day is from 7.30 a.m.
to 5.30 p.m. with two smoke-
ohs of half-an-hour each and
one-hour’s break for lunch.
Another fact influencing the
record was that the sheep were
not caught by the shearer. He
took each ewe in a sitting
position from another member
of the gang about 6ft. from
the board. As well as saving
the shearer valuable seconds
in turning the sheep over, it
must also have saved him a
considerable amount of energy
and helped still further with
his record. As each sheep w ; as
started, Brough’s fleecers held
the fleece so that it would not
interfere w : th his strokes.
Brough is reported to have
used an individual style he
has developed himself —short,
even and swift blows, a wrist
action instead of a blow from
the shoulder and this was
considered to save much
effort. The sheep were five-
and six-year-olds, in full wool,
but, being of Cheviot-cross,
would be very bare on the
points. The average time for
each sheep was just under 65
sec., but one sheep was timed
at 35sec,
In conclusion, it must be
pointed out that, while the
record is quite possible in the
conditions set and with the
particular type of sheep used,
it would be impossible under
normal working - conditions,
where the. shearer would not
have anyone assisting him. As
the shearing of each sheep
averaged only 65sec., it can be
appreciated that, had it been
necessary for the shearer to
catch the sheep and push the
wool away himself, he would
have taken a few seconds
longer on each sheep and thus
his tally would have been con-
siderably lower.
Sharpening Handsaws
“Bigend”: Here’s a steady
job for a rainy day ; all you
need is a file and a saw-set.
Fix the saw, teeth-up, in a
vice, with a piece of wood on
each side of the blade to keep
the steel from bowing. If the
teeth have worn uneven, level
them off by running a file
along them. If you hold the
file flat in the hand and keep
the fingers against the blade
of the saw, you won’t risk cut-
ting your hand. When the
teeth have been set
them with a saw-set. Punch-
ing the teeth against a piece
of wood with a hammer and
punch is probably the best way
to ruin a saw. Instead, count
the number of teeth -points to
an inch and set the handsaw
on this number.
Next, sharpen the teeth with
a three-cornered file—never
use a round one —the blade
held very firmly in the vice,
because any wobbling will
upset the angle of the teeth.
File rip-saws at an angle of
60deg., and crosscut-saws
with the teeth back another
12deg. from this point. Point
the file a little towards the
handle of the saw, to give the
teeth a sharper cutting-edge.
Each gullet needs four strokes
of the file. Do all the teeth
one way, then file them on the
other side. A wipe with an oily
rag will stop saws from rusting
after use and will also keep
an edge on the teeth.
Underground Water
“Geekay”: “H.A.L.’s” open-
ing remark (B. 22/4/”59) is
worthy of being widely quoted.
There are many other parts of
Australia, besides South Aus-
tralia, which need water, so
the urge of “pure necessity”
applies elsewhere, though it
doesn’t necessarily yield water.
South Australia leads the
way. Shallow boring has been
carried-on for many years by
the S.A. Mines Department and
other Government bodies.
While boring for water they
have come across unexpected
but useful deposits of clays,
barite and other minerals, but
water has been regarded as the
prize, and the policy they have
followed has been continuous.
The Westralian Government
might well take a leaf out of
this book. Ground-water sup-
plies would be of enormous
value in the country south from
Norseman to Esperance and
north of the Mt. Magnet-
Menzies line.
The Beef Industry
Up North
“F.A.”: The proposal to
reconstruct the railway from
Mt. Isa to Townsville ’ has
drawn the attention of northern
cattlemen and others interested
in the wider aspects of develop-
ment to the crude and waste-
ful conditions of the beef-
industry in Queensland and the
Territory.
For half-a-century this indus-
try has been struggling against
hazards of climate and lack
of communications—especially
of rail-transport. As far back
as 1935 the plight of cattlemen
in north-western Queensland
and the Territory was voiced
at a conference of the British
Commonwealth, held in Sydney
under the aegis of the Royal
Institute of International
Affairs. A paper on the sub-
ject aroused more interest,
perhaps, than any other read
at that gathering of representa-
tives from all over the world.
Its argument was that west-to-
east railways were necessary
for the transport of cattle on
the hoof and later of chilled
beef. This is still true today,
if Australia’s northern beef-
industry is ever to have a
chance of competing with the
Argentine for European
markets.
The reason the Argentine
can beat us at every move in
this trade is that it has good
transport. At the turn of the
century Brit'sh capital poured
into the South American repub-
lic, which was then governed
with comparative stability.
This capital took the form of
British rolling-stock, British
livestock and British engineer-
ing skill. As a result, within
a generation the Argentine
was able to send as much beef
overseas as all other exporting
countries combined., Beeves
bred in the hinterland were
rushed by rail to fattening-
areas of alfalfa, close to
Rosario and other loading-
places along the River Plate,
where chilled carcasses could
be shipped in the best possible
condition.
Compare this with condi-
tions prevailing in Northern
Australia. Cattle are bred on
country where water is gener-
ally so ill-distributed that they
are forced to travel miles every
day to get it; then, when they
are mature and ready for dis-
patch, great leggy mobs have
to travel for weeks or months
on end, reaching the railhead
or saleyard in whatever condi-
tion the state of the stock-
routes permits. If they find
their way to fattening-country
in the east they put-on weight,
which spoils their store-condi-
tion even more and ends by
presenting the housewife over-
seas with tough meat over-
burdened with selvedge-fat.
This uneconomic and
irrational procedure can be put
right only by completely
abandoning the stock-route.
Railways running from the
extreme west and north-west
of Queensland and from the
Channel country towards the
coast, connected by cross-lines
where necessary, are the only
means of making our northern
beef-industry into anything
better than an irregular source
of low-grade meat.

attacks the roots of the plants,
and prevents free passage of
water through them. A
poisonous substance pro-
duced by the fungus, together
with this stoppage of water,
causes wilt. The fungus lives in
the soil, particularly acid soil.
The disease is most active
during the late spring and
summer, but light attacks may
occur at any season.
Fusarium-wilt first comes to
the farm in seed, and may be
spread from soil washing down
slopes, or from soil carried on
ploughs and vehicles. The
removal of infested plants to
clean land for burning may
cause infection from fungus-
spores. In early stages of the
disease infected plants stop
growing and the lower leaves
on the stem slowly become
yellow and die. The warmer
the weather, the quicker the
plant dies. Diseased leaves
easily drop off when touched,
and brownish streaks will be
noticed if the bark is stripped
from the stem just above the
ground. These gradually en-
circle the stem as the disease
develops.
Spraying is useless for this
condition, because no effective
specific has been discovered,
but care and attention will
lessen chances of infection.
Make seed-beds in ground not
previously used for growing
tomatoes, and burn all diseased
plants and the residue of crops
on the ground where they were
grown. Sow only wilt-resisting
varieties ; although even these,
given favorable conditions,
may contract the disease. New
and better wilt - resisting
varieties are being introduced,
but of the older varieties, the
following are reputed to be
resistant: Pritchard, Pearson,
Break o’ Day, Valiant, Rut-
gers, Red Marhio and Mar-
globe.
Equine Anaemia
“North”: A recent New Zea-
land Government regulation
prohibits the return to that
country of any horse which
has been in Queensland, unless
it has spent six months in a
“clean” southern State. A
N.S.W- regulation prohibits the
entry into that State of any
horse from north of the 25th
parallel, just south of Bunda-
berg, and prevents southern
horses competing in North
Queensland shows, races, camp-
drafts or rodeos. These bans
are intended to prevent the
spread of equine infectious
anaemia.
About two years ago an out-
break of this disease was re-
ported on grazing-properties in
the Rockhampton district.
Quarantine measures were im-
posed and a buffer belt was set-
up round quarantined proper-
ties. A State-wide survey by
the veterinary branch of the
Queensland Agricultural De-
partment has shown that the
disease has not spread outside
the quarantined area. To date,
losses from the malady amount
to 10 per cent, of the total
number of horses on the pro-
perties.
Efforts have been made to
diagnose the disease, and
samples were forwarded to a
laboratory in Italy, without
conclusive results. Resistance
of horses to the disease is
lowered when they are over-
worked and underfed.
Beeatmg the Fox
“D.F.”: Living at Brungle,
near Gundagai (N.S.W.), in a
valley surrounded by rough
hills, we are particularly vul-
nerable to raids by foxes.
Now, after about three years’
trial and error, we have suc-
ceeded in outwitting them.
We had known for some
time that odd lambs were dis-
appearing, but since the losses
always occurred at night, it
was difficult to know what to
do. Everyone had his own
idea, but eventually the choice
was narrowed-down to poison
or a foxproof yard. We had
seen too much of the results
of poisoning by others, so we
settled for the yard.
At first, of course, it was
all very much in the nature
of an experiment. We chose
a sheltered gully and built an
enclosure big enough to
accommodate about 500 ewes
with comfort. We built it
from Bft. poles of green timber,
which we cut on the spot, and
made use of standing trees
wherever possible. We ran
wires through and completed
the job with two heights of
3ft. wire-netting, weighting the
lower wire down with heavy
logs laid on the inside to stop
foxes scratching underneath.
At the entrance the netting was
held down on the outside, so
that it could be tied-up to allow
the sheep to pass underneath.
At dusk the ewes and lambs
were mustered, the lambs
counted and the whole mob
driven in. When we released
them soon after daylight we
were elated to find that no
lambs were missing, though
the scent of fox was strong all
round the enclosure. A few
mornings later the dogs killed
a miserable-looking fox nearby.
Handicapped by a trap on its
leg, it didn’t have a chance.
Although it had proved quite
successful, we had to abandon
this idea when wet weather
made it impossible to confine
the sheep in such a small
space. By the next autumn we
were ready with a two-acre
paddock on the same spot, but
extending over a rocky knob
to enclose a favorite camp.
On one side we used an exist-
ing fence, with an extra height
of netting on top, leaning out-
wards to stop climbing foxes.
We did the same all round the
new fence, which was the same
as before, except for the 10ft.
iron posts we put in to make
a more lasting job.
At sunset the sheep naturally
headed for the camp, and it
was simply a matter of shut-
ting the gates behind them.
Ewes with new-born lambs
were left outside, because we
had found that foxes rarely
take these —it’s the older, play-
ful lambs they usually choose.
The sheep soon accepted the
yarding as routine and gave us
no trouble at all. In the morn-
ing the western gate was
opened and, as the mob strung
out, it was easy to count the
lambs and look the ewes over.
Afterwards we would check-
over any newly-borns (which
would remain in the yard all
day), and then open the eastern

gate ready for the
muster.
This time we designed the
gates to allow a horse to be
ridden through. The netting
from each side overlapped and
could be tied securely, making
it easy to open the gate quickly
and then wire the netting back
out of the way. The bottom
overlap was held down by
heavy rocks.
As far as we know no fox
ever got under the fence,
though hunger drove them to
climb over by means of a
strainer-post on the old fence.
Seeing their scratches on the
post, we set three rabbit-traps
on it and caught a lusty-young
fox the first night and three
older ones later. Even when
lambing finished and the yard
was left open, the foxes con-
tinued to enter by the strainer,
and we caught two more
before we blocked their path
with an additional piece of
netting.
Even at their worst, foxes
never troubled us during the
day, when the sheep grazed
within sight of the house. But
we took precautions: a man
rode quietly round the pad-
docks twice a day.
Now we have extended the
enclosure to about five acres,
and the sheep virtually yard
themselves. The outlay in
materials has been consider-
able, but our losses from foxes
are negligible. We feel it has
been a worth-while investment,
particularly since it entails very
little extra work.
Tractor Accidents
“Freddie”: Every year at
least a dozen people are killed
through accidents with farrm
tractors. Safety-councils have
found that most of these fatali-
ties are caused by sheer careless-
ness. It’s so easy to jump off
the tractor while it’s going, and
to the experienced driver there
seems little risk in doing so.
Yet this was the cause of half
of last year’s accidents.
It isn't really easy to jump
off a tractor and land on one’s
feet well clear of the machine.
The outsize wheels, and draw-
bar at the back —probably
with an implement attached —
make such a leap something
out of the ordinary. One slip
or short jump, and the rear-
wheels or towed implement are
on top of the driver before he
can move. The remedy? Stop
the machine before getting off.
Another simple oversight
which often proves fatal is re-
fuelling when the tractor is
very hot. This most frequently
happens during harvest or
sowing, when time is precious.
The tractor, white-hot from
hours of work, acts like a
match on spilt fuel. It’s better
to grease the machine while
it’s very hot. By the time this
is done, the metal will be cool
enough to allow refuelling.
When tractor-wheels were
fitted with spud-lugs it was
impossible to freewheel any
distance, because the spuds,
gripping into the ground, soon
stopped the machine. Rubber
tyres have changed this. It’s
very tempting to hit the
machine up to 20 miles an
hour, throw it out-of-gear and
coast downhill. But the snag
comes when it starts to get
away from you—try slipping
into gear then. By the time
you’ve crashed through the
revolving gears in the box the
damage is done. The machine
generally finishes-up in a creek
or a ditch on the side of the
road. One of the safety-
council’s recommendations is
never to allow tractors to
coast. Four men were killed
that way last year. Riding on
the drawbar is another
common cause of accidents.
Almost always an implement is
being dragged behind, so a
sudden fall means it’s all over
in a matter of seconds.
Other commonsense rules
are: don’t run the machine
with the power take-off
engaged unless it is being
used ; and don’t work around
the tractor with lqose, flapping
clothing, such as shirts, hang-
ing out.
Crosscuts
“Nimrod”: A recommenda-
tion by the Kalgoorlie Cham-
ber of Commerce, that every
householder should plant a
couple of olive-trees in his
backyard, could double Aus-
tralia’s production of olive-oil
within 10 years. Between 5000
and 10,000 trees would thus be
established in Kalgoorlie, yield-
ing at maturity an average of
20,000ga1. of oil a year. This
is the present average annual
production of olive-oil for the
whole of Australia.
“Darling Downs”: A Dar-
ling Downs' property-owner
recently put-down 200 acres of
pasture, at a cost of £6 an acre
(excluding depreciation on
machinery), in an area where
it was previously impossible to
breed or fatten. As a result,
in one year from 75 acres he
turned-off 424 fat-lambs, which
sold at £3 ss. a head, and on
the rest of the land he fattened
443 wethers which brought
him £l-a-head profit. Poorer
flock-sheep were lifted in con-
dition and culled wethers off-
shears were fattened and sold
at £3 12s. 6d. a head.
“MacMuirick”: Reports
from the U.S. seem to show
that dubbing layers will in-
crease egg-production. Dubbed
birds (those with their combs
and wattles removed) averaged
a production of 64 per cent,
compared with 60 per cent,
from undubbed ones. Feed re-
quired was down, too. The
treated birds needed 5.061 b. a
dozen eggs compared with
5.671 b. for the others. An in-
teresting point was that it is
necessary to dub both wattles
and combs for best results.
“S.”: Trials in Victoria show
that Aberystwyth strains of
cocksfoot—S.26 and S. 143 —
are as productive as the best
N.Z. varieties and can be re-
commended for . high-rain-
fall or irrigation areas. Danish
strains don’t seem worth
persisting with. Aberystwyth
produces feed all the year
round, but the Danish varie-
ties run quickly to stem and
are of little feed-value during
summer, autumn and winter.

Information Sought
Account of the Mitchell-Donald-
son duel last century ?
In September, 1851, Stuart
Donaldson, a Sydney politician and
merchant, attacked the Government,
charging it with extravagance; he
referred particularly to the Surveyor-
General’s Department, which he
said cost £40,000 a year. Sir
Thomas Mitchell, Surveyor-General,
wrote to the “Sydney Morning
Herald” contradicting the state-
ment and adding that he “left the
public to stamp its own reprobation
upon a monstrous charge so falsely
and so carelessly made.” One
Dobie, on behalf of Donaldson,
demanded the withdrawal of the
word “falsely,” and was referred by
Mitchell to his friend Lieut.
Burrowes. After several confer-
ences, notes were exchanged
between Dobie and Burrowes; each
party withdrew statements made,
and the letters were sent to the
“Herald” for publication. When
Mitchell read the reply sent on his
behalf he considered it most
unsatisfactory, with the result that
he challenged Donaldson to a duel.
The parties met on the Water
Reserve (now Centennial Park) on
-September 27. Three shots were
fired, one of which went through
Donaldson’s hat and one near
Mitchell’s throat; the seconds then
intervened and put an end to the
duel.

How to make a good white-
wash ?
Take a number of large pieces
of fresh lump-lime, put in a very
large bucket or other suitable con-
tainer and into this pour hot water.
Cold water will do, but hot water
is better, as it hastens the slaking.
The lime will start to boil and
break-up. Keep it covered all the
time with about half-an-inch of
water. Before the lime starts to
boil fiercely add tallow or common
fat in the proportion of about
llb.-21b. to 71b. of lump-lime. This
makes a good binder, which will
prevent the wash from rubbing-off.
If desired, a little yellow-ochre may
be added; it will give a cream or
buff tint, according to the quantity
used. When the lime is thoroughly
slaked it should be stirred and
enough water added to make it
a little heavier than, say, milk.
Strain and apply, either hot or
cool.

A recipe for whole-wheat bread
in which the wheat has to be passed
through a mincing-machine ?
This recipe was probably in vogue
during the austerity years; it has
since been discarded. Take a
quantity of wheat, wash well and
boil for 30min. to 60min. (some
kinds of wheat need longer treat-
ment than others). Strain and dry
with a tea-towel, then spread out
in a shallow baking-dish and bake
in the oven until dry and very
slightly browned. Grind through
a mincer. To use, take one part
of this meal, one part ordinary
wholemeal and two parts flour;
make into bread by the process
described in all cookery-books.
Try a small batch first, and vary
the proportions according to your
own liking.

Where is the Flynn Memorial
Cairn situated, and what is the
inscription on it ?
The cairn, which is 30ft. high,
is situated at the junction of the
Sturt Highway and the turn-off to
Mt. Isa, outside Tennant Creek.
It is built of local stone, and
chipped white quartz is scattered
at the base of the grave. The most
outstanding feature of the cairn
is the 12-ton rock, brought from
the Devil’s Marbles outcrop near
Tennant Creek, which is balanced
on the stone base. The inscription,
set on a bronze plaque, reads:
“Under this stone rest the ashes of
‘Flynn of the Inland,’ the Very Rev.
John Flynn, 0.8. E., D.D., first
superintendent (1912-1951) of the
Australian Inland Mission, founder
of the Flying Doctor Service,
moderator-general of the Presby-
terian Church of Australia 1939-42.
He brought gladness and rejoicing
to the wilderness and the solitary
places.”
Brief Answers
J.M.: Income-tax was first levied
by the State of N.S.W. under the
Land and Income Tax Assessment
Act of 1895. This Act was assented
to on December 12, 1895. Income-
tax was first levied by the Common-
wealth of Australia under the
Income Tax Assessment Act, 1915;
the Act was assented to on Sep-
tember 13, 1915... .H.P.McI.: The
answer is usually yes, otherwise
there would be no reason for
admitting such an officer to ex-
officio standing; but in societies or
private groups you would need to
refer to the constitution, since it
provides for these contingencies and
lays-down its own inflexible rules.
In the case of more important
bodies, such as local-government
affairs, it would be wise to consult
the Minister for Local Government
in your own State, as any devia-
tion from the legal method of
procedure could invalidate the
doings of a committee or council
and lead to disputes. Write to the
Minister in your State and ask for
any booklets available on the sub-
ject D.G.: The best course
would be to contact the Society of
Australian Genealogists, 148 Phillip
Street, Sydney; Box 860, G.P.0.,
Sydney... .A.J.G.: If you mean
Italian writing, this was a form of
finely-penned script sloping towards
the right, as in italic printing, and
was taught and used by educated
people in mid-Victorian times.
More robust forms are still in
general use; a person’s handwriting
might easily be described as italic.
If you mean the new type of writing
now being taught in some Austra-
lian schools, apply for details to
the Department of Education in
your State capital... .A.F.: World
Animal Week usually begins on the
first Sunday in October each year.
Full information about this year’s
commemoration can be had from
Miss Margaret Cowie, Box 1577,
G.P.0., Sydney... .W.T.R.: No
information available on that
episode in “Truth’s” past....

New Recordings
Biggs Plays Bach
American organist E. Power
Biggs spends a good deal of
time racing around Europe
playing historic instruments.
His entourage invariably in-
cludes recording - engineers
using the very best high-
fidelity equipment and, as
may be expected, the results
are always interesting. This
time, on Coronet KLC 591,
Biggs has toured southern
Germany, Austria and Holland
to give us by far the most
lucid and tonally replete ver-
sion of Bach’s Eight Little
Preludes and Fugues on record.
These pieces were written by
Bach for his pupils, but that
is not to say they fall into the
same class as Czerny’s student
pieces. As Biggs remarks in a
jacket-note, the word “little”
must be regarded as “an affec-
tionate diminutive” ; a happy
choice of words, because affec-
tion shines through every pre-
lude and fugue. There is the
C Major, a compact progres-
sion through related keys —
in the second section the
manual part seems to rise and
rise, even though it’s nailed-
down to strict bass counter-
point. In the brief pause be-
tween prelude and fugue you
can distinctly hear the chirping
of sparrows—not unlike people
at a concert who clap in the
wrong spot. But it’s a nice
touch; three cheers to the
engineers for leaving the sounds
in. This organ, by the way,
is a Silbermann instrument,
located at Ebersmunster,
Alsace.
Each prelude and fugue is
performed on a different
organ; for the connoisseur, a
chance to study the voicing of
master-builders. In the third
prelude and fugue (E Minor)
the extreme richness of the
instrument is staggering—this
is'the organ at the Pilgrimage
Church, Absam, Austria. The
final pedal entry in the fugue
is a stunner ; Biggs uses a
whopping 16ft. reed, probably
a Bombarde or Trombone.
This prelude and fugue has
always been a favorite with this
writer, and, if it may help to
alleviate the “student” stigma,
has been heard played as an
incoming voluntary at St.
Andrew’s Cathedral, Sydney.
Biggs plays them all with
dedicated artistry, and though
his rallentandos In the C Major
seem a little protracted, his
timing and- sense of color
elsewhere are compensating
factors. And it’s pleasing to
think that, long after these fine
old organs return to dust, we
will have some memorial to
them.
Honegger and' Dukas
It says something for the
skill of Ernest Ansermet and
L’Orchestre de La Societe des
Concerts du Conservatoire de
Paris (whew!) that Honegger
is accurately represented.
Name of the piece is “Pacific
231” and, together with
Dukas’s “Sorcerer’s Appren-
tice,” is to be found on Decca
LW 5155.
The Honegger piece is a
marvellous and noisy curiosity.
The composer attempts to
translate into musical form the
impression of a 300-ton loco-
motive tearing along at 120
m.p.h. One would like to say
he succeeds, but one or two
points stand in the way. First,
despite Honegger’s assur-
ance that he doesn’t imitate
the sounds of the locomotive,
much of this music is
frankly descriptive. Again,
since such a conception won’t
break-up happily into move-
ments (imagine a first-move-
ment marked Andante loco-
motive !) there’s only one
solution: to make it a com-
plete single-sentence work.
This is what Honegger does.
At first you hear the engine
hissing steam, then gradually
accelerating. The climax is
reached when the thing is
screaming along at top speed,
and here the mournful long
brass bursts are clever. One
can almost see the express
thundering along a straight
stretch at dead of night.
Finally, it slows-up, with much
snorting and hissing and with
successively slower chords -
all dissonant—until the tension
eases with the long unison-note
at the end.
The Dukas number on the
reverse side is quite charming
—plenty of whimsy, tons of
catchy rhythm. All in all, the
record is worth buying— not
so much for the Dukas as the
Honegger. Ansermet, while he
may have his limitations in
earlier music, is pretty good on
the modern stuff.

Ravel and Prokofieff
On D.G.Gr 17042 LPE
you’ll find Ravel’s “Bolero”
and Prokofieff’s “Classical
Symphony,” both played by the
R.I.A.S. Symphony Orchestra,
Berlin, under Ferenc Fricsay.
Prokofieff said this music was
inspired by Haydn, but, listen-
ing to it, one cannot help but
observe the gentle irony that
pervades it. Everywhere the
music is almost Haydn ; then a
sudden burst of modern tonal-
ity forces you to change your
mind. There are four move-
ments, each a gem of colorful
and witty writing. Take the
delightful gavotte (third
movement): here is an ele-
gantly slender little dance,
colorfully scored ; the prin-
cipal theme is certainly Haydn-
esque, but the treatment,
though still within a fairly tight
framework, reaches out to new
fields.
What remains to be said
about the exciting “Bolero”?
There is the familiar single
theme, in C 'Major, repeated 18
times, each time louder by a
different instrument or group
of instruments. There are the
novel orchestral touches—the
theme is handled at one stage
by two instruments playing in
fourths. And, of course, there
are the noble drums with their
pattern of cross-rhythms.
The pieces make a good
double, and the interpretation
is impeccable.

Women's Letters
MELBOURNE
It was most cheering, on a dull and
dreary day, just to sit and watch manne-
quins parade in the lovely silk and cotton
frocks which form the summer collec-
tion from Flinders Lane manufacturer
Douglas Cox. The styles were simple but
elegant ; the skirts just a nice length and
either cut on sheath-lines or featuring
full skirts of unpressed pleats. Novel
touches were seen at the waistline of many
frocks. A series of tiny pleats running
from the side-waist and finishing just
under the arm gave movement to a fitted
bodice. Fullness at the waist gave a
bloused effect at the back of the frock,
which was finished with a shaped belt.
Another smart feature of this collect-
ion was an ensemble which looked like
a smart frock. But when the mannequin
gently pulled at the wide belt there
emerged a tiny jacket to effect an
ensemble. The jacket removed, there was
revealed a smart cocktail-frock. “Lolli-
pop” was the name given to a frock in
tonings of mauve, green, blue and pink
satin stripes on a white cotton back-
ground.
Florals abounded in this delightful
collection. One frock featured a print of
soft mauve pansies and green leaves on a
white pure-silk background. Tangerine
roses romped gaily over a frock of white
cotton. Pink roses and green leaves
printed on white were used to make a
smart frock with a cross-over bodice, the
skirt featuring a wide floating back-
panel lined with silk. Carnations bloomed
in rich profusion on a wfiite siik frock
which showed a draped bodice and cuffed
sleeves. Unusual print-designs included
gipsy caravans trekking around the
skirt and on the short bolero to cover-up
the bare look, and soft blue jars and
bottles printed to give a clever bayadere
effect. Coins of the realm, uncut gems,
chrysanthemums and gladioli were other
prints noted, and the pure-silk Paisley-
designs were very lovely.

There was an unusual touch at the
party given by the Victorian
Symphony Orchestra Subscribers’
Committee at Majella House, St.
Kilda Road, for visiting Rumanian con-
ductor Constantin Silvestri. As the
maestro speaks very little English,
Rumanian-born Sandra Atanassiou, who
works in the A.B.C.’s record-library,
translated for him his speech of thanks.
The committee’s deputy-president, Howard
King, spoke the words of welcome, and
with his wife received the guests. Mrs.
King looked attractive in a Parma-violet
wool frock and a matching cloche
trimmed with a mauve osprey. Lelene
Cairns Lloyd, the hon.' secretary, wore
with her smart black frock a small toque
of pink tulle trimmed with pink roses
and forget-me-nots. Guests included Mr.

Keith Halliday, orchestra-leader Bertha
Jorgensen, Sir John Medley, and Mrs.
Ewart Chappie (her black-and-white-
check wool frock set-off with a black-

The skirt was bell-shaped in front and
fell into a short train at the back. Her
fingertip tulle veil was held with a
diamond-and-pearl tiara. She was un-

The theme of the dinner-dance at
Ciro’s, which was arranged by the Young
Contingent of the Victoria League, Was
“Maytime in Mayfair.” The large scenes'
of Mayfair which decorated the walls
were done in charcoal by Jane Teas-
dale, Pat Barbbur, Diana Luxton and
Diana Guthrie. Individual tables carried
pink-and-white maypoles draped with
pink-and-white streamers and filled with
pink blossom. In the foyer was a street-
barrow in pink and white, filled with
greenery. Committee-president Pamela
Middleton (whose strapless short frock
of hyacinth-blue silk-taffeta had a drape
on the sheath-skirt caught-up into a
large bow on one hip) was assisted in
receiving the 180 guests by hon. secretary
Joan Duckett (her formal gown was of
daffodil-yellow satin). Official guests were
Mrs. Guy Bakewell (senior vice-president
of the Victoria League), one of the vice-
presidents (Mrs. Frank May), and her
husband, Dr. Frank May. Also at Pam’s
table were Mr. and Mrs. George Treden-
nick (Canberra), Mr. and Mrs. Graeme
Fair (her short, full frock of gold-
patterned faille), Ann Dixon, Max
Chapman, and Tjerd Poutsma.
Margaret Herring, wearing a pastel-
pink satin-brocade gown with a short
matching jacket, brought a party, among
whom were Dr. Aileen Connan (medical
superintendent of the Queen Victoria
Hospital), and Dr. Helen Murrell (the
deputy-superintendent). Joy Miniken
wore one of the prettiest frocks: made
from a gold-embroidered cream sari, it
was swathed and form-fitting, and a
drape fell from the back of the strap-
less top. Elizabeth Duckett’s powder-
blue silk-taffeta frock featured a pleated
bodice held with shoestring straps, the
short, full skirt having a harem-hemline.
Clarissa Starey chose ming-blue silk-
taffetas.


SYDNEY
Though not “all wool and a yard
wide,” the week had a very high per-
centage of that invaluable fibre in it, and
therefore one could say that it was a
high-quality week. The diamond-jubilee
sheep-show at the Showground was voted
the best ever, with the G. B. S. Falkiners
doing the honors, and the Merrimans
taking the prizes.

Other topics of conversation which
drew heated argument during the week
included the possibility of the shops
staying open on Friday night and closing
on Saturday. As one who has spent two
lost-weekends in Auckland (N.Z.), where
shops do not open on Saturday, this
Letter gives witness that the system is
death to lonely visitors imprisoned in a
ghost-city. On the other hand, it must
be very nice for the inhabitants, who
are all off boating, swimming, skating,
fishing, washing their hair, etc. Of course,
some people oppose Saturday-closing be-
cause they identify all shop-assistants with
their union-secretary, and they say: “I’m
not going to do my shopping on Friday,
just to please Ernie O’Dea.” Actually,
many shop-assistants, especially those
behind the cosmetic counters, don’t look
a bit like Mr. O’Dea.

The unique Watson’s Bay Wharf Art
Exhibition has detached itself for the
time being from its environment of
fishing-lines and lapping waves and has
taken up residence in the art gallery of
Anthony Hordern’s store. Lord Mayor
Jensen opened its display there during
the week, and visitors had the pleasure
of gazing, not only at the paintings, but
also at Miss Googie Withers and John
McCallum, stars of “Roar Like a Dove.”
Miss Withers’ royal-blue mohair coat,
topped with a mink toque, was also
gazed upon with admiration. - These two
stars, by the way, have bought a house
in Toorak, Melbourne, and will move-in
next time they go south. The whole
exhibition is being held in aid of the
Royal N.S.W. Institution for Deaf and
Blind Children, which receives a percent-
age of every sale made. Noted that the
earliest picture to go was Norman
Lindsay’s lovely oil, “Sunlight.”

When Lady Slim opened the sixth
annual conference of Torchbearers for
Legacy during the week —looking very
charming in bronze silk-shantung, mink
stole and green hat of curled-wool
feathers—she made special reference to
the delegates from other States (Mr. D.
A. Freecorn and Mr. R. S. Hunter had
come all the way from Perth, W.A.) and
said that she looked forward to the time
when Torchbearers for Legacy would be
nationwide. Mrs. Lionel McFadyen, who
was elected president unopposed for her
eleventh term of office, announced a very
satisfactory response -to the drive for new
members, and the president of Sydney
Legacy, Major-General I. N. Dougherty,
outlined the aims of the organisation,
stressing the work it does in striving to
fill the gap left by the absent fathers of
war-orphans. The conference was held
for two days and concluded with a
cocktail-party at Elwatan, Vaucluse, the
home of vice-president Mrs. Robert
Dixon.
Mrs. Jeff Bate, a distinguished woman
in public life and well-known as a
speaker of forcefulness and vigor, was
recently elected State president of the
Country Women s Association of N.S.W.
She has represented Australia at four
international conferences, and, apart
from the C.W.A., her main interest is
working to help the Colombo-plan
students in Australia. Wife of the Federal
member for Macarthur, Mrs. Bate has
her home at Marshmead, Tilba Tilba, on
the south coast. She has also lived in
the Trangie district, and for 13 years in
the back-country . between Cobar and
Ivanhoe.
“The Greeks are a freedom-loving
people,” said Mr. A. C. Gooma at the

Gooma, who is secretary to the Consul-
General for Greece, gave a warm and
lively talk about the Greeks in Australia
from 1815 to the present day, and drew
attention to the link with Queensland’s
centenary this year, for the wife of
Queensland’s first Governor was a Greek
girl from the lonian Isles, Diamantina

Old service-uniforms and period gowns
came out of their glass-cases to be worn
again to create an historical pageant at
the Albert Hall. The ghostly pageant of
history, “From a Colony to a Nation,”
was part of the Commonwealth Day
celebrations arranged by the Royal Com-
monwealth Society. Scarlet-coated 19th-
century soldiers formed a guard of honor
for the Governor-General, Sir William
Slim, and Lady Slim, who were welcomed
to the pageant by the acting-president Mr.
H. C. Newman and Mrs. Newman.
Tracing the early settlement of Aus-
tralia, the first to take their places were
two aborigines, against a background-

Dampier and dapper George 111 were
followed by Captain Cook and Governors
Phillip and Macquarie. Among the
explorers was Gregory Blaxland,
portrayed by his great-great-grandson
Daryl Blaxland. John Garran represented
his father, the late Sir Robert. A fanfare
of trumpets heralded the appearance of
Queen Victoria, whose original procla-

Australia is still to be seen in King’s Hall
at Parliament House.


“now,” but simply that the ambas-
sador should “even now” start nego-
tiating the alliance in case America
should go to war.
The telegram was. in short, essen-
tially a propaganda bomb. As such
it was .admittedly useful. It stirred
even Wilson himself, when he first read
it. to the almost profane ejaculation,
“Good Lord! Good Lord!”;' and it
moved the Buffalo “Express” to
prophecies of “hordes of Mexicans
under German officers sweeping into
Texas. New Mexico and Arizona.” In
fact the whole country was in a state
of fury and alarm about it. As Mrs.
Tuchman rightly enough concludes, it
ended —or should have —American
“innocence.”
But it was not, all the same, the
reason why Wilson took his “fateful
decision.” He released the telegram
to Congress and the press, in fact,
as “a last resort against war”; or, more
precisely, as an inducement to Con-
gress to pass the Armed Ship Bill
which he saw as the last hope of
avoiding war. The arming of U.S.
merchantment. would, he hoped, deter
Germany from the unrestricted sub-
marine campaign, and. as Mrs. Tuch-
man indeed makes clear enough, it
was the submarines, more than any-
thing else, that at last forced Wilson
to act. American lives were being lost
at sea, American ships w'ere being
sunk, American trade in war-materials
was paralysed; Britain, so deeply in
debt to America, might be forced to
submit to Germany: it was time,
telegram or no telegram, to move in.
But if Mrs. Tuchman has over-
emphasised the significance of her
telegram a little, as is natural in a
book about it, it is still a most fascinat-
ing book. It shows with much signifi-
cance how one man’s will, even in a
democracy, can influence and modify,
if it cannot finally alter, the course
of history; it shows once again—in an
earlier example of what we were to
see in Hitler’s days—the strange
suicidal mania that seems to overtake
the Germans in war (for it was obvious
that the submarines would bring
America in; “Finis Germaniae!” said
Bethmann-Hollweg, the Chancellor,
when the fatal decision was taken);
and, humorous and well-written, it is
full of extraordinary stories of intrigue,
counter-intrigue and the intriguers.
It seems a pity to draw attention
to one of the few minor flaws in the
prose; but, reading that “the peon,
the ‘submerged 85 per cent.’ . . .
huddled in the dust of deserted vil-
lages,” this reviewer, remembering the
unfortunate “Times” man, would jus!
like to say hello to Mrs. Tuchman.
Walt Disney
Walt Disney’s life, as told by his
daughter Diane to Pete Martin
(Odhams) shows how you have to be
a paper-boy if you want to get to the
top. Born in Chicago to a father who
had been contractor and farmer, and
who soon became a farmer again in
Marcelline, Missouri, the farm where
he picked up his love of animals,
Disney became delivery-boy on the
newspaper-run his old man bought in
Kansas City when he had gone broke
again farming.
He got up at 3.30 a.m., and when
he came to a steam-heated apartment-
house he’d lie down for five minutes
and wake up with the sun rising, not
remembering if he’d delivered his
papers in that house. He took cartoon
correspondence courses, and was going
to art-school when, at 16. he said he
was 17 and joined a Red Cross ambul-
ance unit. He was too late for the war,
but he had a year as an ambulance-
driver in France before he came home,
still only 17. He left his family, now
resettled in Chicago, and began draw-
ing for advertising in Kansas City,
formed a partnership and joined a film-
advertising company. “From then
on the pictures he drew were to be
photographed on film.” Animated ads.
were photographed in reverse: —
I’d start with a big card covered
with neatly lettered advertising
copy. I’d hold it before the camera
for the length of time it would be
seen on the screen at the end of the
ad. After that, using the stop-
camera process, I began'to cut those
letters out and move them around
until, in the finished film, they
seemed to come flying in to gather
in orderly sequence on the screen.
He borrowed a camera, and at home
began experimenting with “Laugh-O-
Grams,” animated advertisements for
coal, motor-car hoods, paints and
banks, in which his hand could be seen
doing the drawing. This outside work,
sold to a small film-house circuit, made
him a reputation. He took-on unpaid
apprentices to learn animation, and
while still under 21 became president
of the Laugh-O-Gram Corporation,
capitalised at 15,000 dollars. It went
broke, and for a while he was living
on tinned beans; but he made his first
“Alice in Wonderland” reel, in which
a live little girl romped with animated
cartoons. He took this with him to
Hollywood.
There he took-up cartoon advertis-
ing again, while he canvassed Eastern
distributors with his “Alice” reel, at
last getting an offer of 1500 dollars
each for a series of them. He got his
brother Roy in to help him; they
borrowed 500 dollars from his Uncle
Robert; their first film cost 750 dollars,
and they made that much on it. He
photographed the live little girl against
a white drop, then filled-in the cartoon-
figures around her; each reel was 300 ft.
of cartoons, padded out with 600 ft. of
real children, at 50 cents a day, “going
SCENES FROM CHILDHOOD
With a rind of lemon
You rub your kitchen-table white
For me to dream on
And to write
As 1 wrote “paino”
On your sense of irony,
Inviting you /
To music after tea:
When your husband played
For the children’s hymnody
Your attention strayed
In an unrelated key ;
But when I played Schubert
In fiats as morbid as his corpse
You cut me to the heart
With your lemon sharps:
“You never come to see me
Unless you want a piece of wood ” —
Gifts left in your pepper-tree
Fostered my ingratitude ;
“You’re always apeing everything.
Never doing something new” —
See how I am varying
A phrase of Campion’s for you :
Shall l mould it to assuage
One of your crisp summer frocks
Among the perfume
Of your beds of stocks?
They are not your flower,
Their heavy fragrance
In essence is too sour
For a true resemblance.
Better harness Bright eyes
To trot your buggy back
And again surprise
The weeping lake
Stretching its loneliness
Out, out to meet the sky,
Merging its unhappiness
Into infinity
When afternoons are dim
And the trees droop evermore
And little fishes swim
Unwanted by the shore:
There, there’s where you must be,
Charming its melancholy
With serene irony
Throughout eternity.

proposing to take over Oswald the
Rabbit.
There was something in the distri-
butor’s contract that enabled him to
take Oswald; so Disney invented
Mickey Mouse:
“The early Mickey was functional;
he was not handsome. He had black
dots for eyes, pencil legs, three fingers
per hand, a string-bean body and a
jerky walk. When he started to talk
Disney became his voice. He has
remained so ever since.” His first
picture with sound was “Steamboat
Willie” —and there is some interesting
stuff in this book on how they syn-
chronised music on the film in New
York by drawing a mark on every
twelfth frame of the film so that it
made a flash as it went through; these
flashes served instead of a metronome
to the conductor.
When he finally got Mickey Mouse
into New York theatres his trouble was
not so much to sell more, as to keep
clear of the big boys who wanted to take
him over and pay him a salary. By the
time he had embarked upon his “Silly
Symphonies” he was offered 2500
dollars a week salaiy—which, much to
his own amazement, he turned down.
Then they began the old game again,
buying-up his head-animator; finally,
having proved too tough to be eaten,
he was able to secure Columbia as his
distributors; then United Artists.
The rest of the book takes in color-
films, full-length cartoon-features,
Donald Duck —whose voice belongs to
a bird-imitator called Clarence Nash,
who:—
Visited classrooms and . . .
demonstrated bird-calls. At the end
of his talk he imitated a little girl
duck recitating “Mary Had a Little
Lamb” . . . But in spite of his many
talents he was at the Disney studio
for a year before father found out
just how he could use him . . . The
trouble was that everyone was think-
ing of Nash as a girl duck. Then
somebody thought of him as a boy
duck. That did it . . .
The first full-length feature-film,
“Snow White,” was two years in the
making, cost more than 1,700,000
dollars (as against the first “Alice’s”
750 dollars), and grossed 8,000,000
dollars “its first time around.” “Fan-
tasia” cost 2,200,000 dollars; “Pinoc-
chio” cost 2,600,000 dollars.
There is the story of how Disney
went to South America to make the
good-neighbor film, “Saludos Amigos,”
for the Government; and of how he
sacrificed Donald Duck to the war-
effort, in a propaganda film directed
at making the Americans pay their
taxes gladly, forcing him on Mr.
Secretary Morgenthau, who wanted
something more dignified. Later
Disney stood by while Congress cut
his bill to the Government and lost
him 4000 dollars on it.
Another chapter is devoted to the
extraordinary amusement-park Disney
has built 28 miles from Los Angeles,
called “Disneyland”:—
The spring before last, he spent
two million dollars on new rides and
new attractions for his park. This
spring he spent five million dollars
on the same things. Originally a
part of Frontierland had been a
painted desert, but father added a
natural-arch bridge, and a long
dark tunnel and stalactites and
stalagmites and illuminated water-
falls. He planned a mine train to
take visitors through the tunnel, and
they could tour the desert in a
stage-coach or a buckboard or rough
it on a mule-pack ride that crossed
a natural-arch bridge..,.
Whether he makes money out of
Disneyland, his daughter doesn’t say—
or how; and maybe this bookful of
similar facts about this extraordinary
man is a good enough reason why his
daughter’s home-life sketches of him
don’t explain him.
The book has many plates of Disney
characters and the people who do 16
drawings to make them move once (a
10-minute cartoon uses 14,400
pictures); there is a list of all Disney’s
films from 1928 to 1958, and an index.
Mountford Bibliography
An interesting piece of Australiana
from Walter W. Stone’s Stone Copying
Co., Cremome, N.S.W., is Charles
Pearcy Mountford; An Annotated
Bibliography, Chronology and Check-
list.
Bibliographies are severely practical
things, meant for libraries and
research-students, and it could be mis-
leading for a reviewer to dig out of
the present booklet such items of
general interest as, for instance, the
note on the South Australian Leich-
hardt Search Expedition, 1938; but
here and there in the bibliography
colorful notes on the expeditions
which Mountford has led, or taken
part in, do occur, and they are cer-
tainly fascinating:—
In August, 1938, Mr. Edwin
Lowe and his son Rex, of Mt. Dare
station, reported to the Chief
Secretary, Sir George Ritchie, the
finding of a group of skeletons
thought to be those of white men, in
.the Simpson Desert. From the
Lowes’ report it was presumed that
this might be the remains of the
Leichhardt exploring party of 1848.
Much press publicity was given to
this report, and a scientific expedi-
tion was quickly organised to
examine the area. On examination
the supposed skeletons were found
to be calcified roots. A careful
search was made and some frag-
ments of aboriginal human remains,
an 1841 three-penny piece, an 1817
half-sovereign, a pack-saddle ring,
old leather and other sundries were
found. The evidence was insufficient
for any definite conclusion, but the
site was fixed and named Ritchie
Ridge, and much useful ethnological
data obtained from the aborigines
and from camp-sites. The party
consisted of the leader, Dr. Grenfell
Price, A. D. Smith, surveyor, Dr.
T. D. Campbell, anthropologist,
C. P. Mountford, ethnologist, A. C..
Kinnear, press and radio, E. and R.
Lowe, guides.
For the rest, after some personal
information, the bibliography lists
Mountford’s books (“Brown Men and
Red Sand,” etc.), books of related
interest by other authors, papers
from scientific journals and other
magazines, press - cuttings, reviews,
music and sound-tracks for documen-
tary films, etc. It is based on a
collection made by Harold Sheard
which he presented to the Public
library of South Australia.
