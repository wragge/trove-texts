TWELFTH CENTURY ENGLAND IS PORTRAYED BY FARNHAM CASTLE
■CARNHAM is an ancient agricultural market town situated on
■ the River Wey, 38 miles south-west of London, and is the centre
of an important hop district. Since 688 the manor has belonged
to the Bishops of Winchester, and the picturesque castle above the
town, which is open to visitors, is now a church house for the
dioceses of Winchester, Guildford and Portsmouth. The castle was
built in 1136 by Henry de Blois, brother of King Stephen, destroyed
by Henry 111 (1216-1272) and reconstructed in 1230. During the
Civil War it was captured by the Parliamentary forces in 3642 and
partly laid in ruins, to be restored later in 1662-84 by Bishop
Morley, to whom it owes its present form. The ruined moated
keep, however, dates from the 12th century. The surroundings,
which include a deer park, lawns, cricket ground and centuries old
cedar trees, are particularly attractive.
Two miles from Farnham on the Godaiming road are the 13th
century ruins of Waverley Abbey, the earliest Cistercian house in
England, from which Sir Walter Scott is reputed to have taken the
name of his first novel. Nearby is Moor Park, the last retreat of
Sir William Temple, who died here in 1699, and it was here that
Dean Swift wrote many of his works. The cottage in which Miss
Johnson lived is still called Stella’s Cottage. In the vicinity are
Mother Ludlam’s and Foot Caves and also the remains of earth-
works called Caesar’s Camp, in which many Roman coins have
been found.

URBAN AND RUSTIC.
A writer in the latest “Southerly” says
that Christina Stead is Australia’s “only
urban novelist.” Though the best
chapters of Letty Fox (Peter Davies,
Ltd.) happen to be set in the American
countryside, as the richest section of For
Love Alone was set at Sydney’s Watson’s
Bay at a time when it was like an isolated
fishing village, the generalisation is true
enough: taking “urban” to mean cosmo-
politan and genuinely sophisticated.
The most severe of the intellectuals who
read Proust and Ulysses and pretend to
read Finnegans Wake could read Chris-
tina Stead without apology. She lives
abroad ; she is published abroad ; she sets
her novels in London, Paris and the
United States; and she may—if she has
not already done so —make a world repu-
tation, like New Zealand’s Katherine
Mansfield.
She is at the opposite extreme in the
art of fiction from Roderick Finlayson,
whose Tidal Creek (Angus and Robert-
son) is an extremely simple tale about a
rustic with red whiskers; an Uncle Ted,
some of whose adventures were first
printed in The Bulletin in short-story
form.
Letty Fox is about a girl in New York
who has, at a conservative estimate,
between the ages of 17 and 25, some 847
lovers; or it may be 93,502 —thousands
of them. She has lovers at her univer-
sity ; she has lovers in the bohemian
circles of New York; she has lovers in
London and Paris; if she does not have
a lover at the North Pole it is merely an
oversight. And Uncle Ted stays home
at Tidal Creek, somewhere north of
Auckland, shaves his red whiskers once
a week on Saturday nights, and never
meets a girl at all; except, once, when
drunk, the glamorous wire-walker of a
circus who kicks him out of her tent to
be cooled off in a horse-trough.
Letty Fox talks about art, literature,
Communism, war and the state of New
York society; Uncle Ted talks about
ploughing. Letty Fox is an expert —a
bewildering one —on the bewildering
divorce laws of America and the bewilder-
ing situations that result from them;
Uncle Ted is an expert on cow manure.
Letty Fox’s ambition is to be married ;
Uncle Ted’s ambition is to go for a
buggy-ride to the North Cape. Christina
Stead’s theme —if she has one—is the
instability of American society ; Roderick
Finlayson’s theme—if he has one —is.
the stability of the New Zealand earth. '
Letty Fox could be placed in the com-
pany of Virginia Woolf’s novels, or D.
H. Lawrence’s. Tidal Creek brings to
mind Henry Lawson and Steele Rudd.
If one is attempting to assess the two
novels by contemporary intellectual
standards Letty Fox is, of course, far
the more impressive. But it is not for
that reason intrinsically a better novel.
It has yet to be determined whether the J
novels that have made a stir among the
highbrows in recent years will stand the
test of time, • If Tidal Creek is a piece
of rustic simplicity, so also was Under
the Greenwood Tree; so was Tom Jones.
Often enough it is the profound mind
that writes the simple story ; the muddled
mind that writes the complex.
In the chances of permanence, Fin-
layson. has an advantage over Christina
Stead which seems, at first sight, unfair.
Europe and America have had a grerft
many distinguished novelists; New Zea-
land—-unless William Satchell can
qualify—none. Australian or New Zea-.
land writers who go abroad take the risk'
of sacrificing for a temporary fame in
Europe a permanent reputation at home.
And this is not so unfair as it seems, for
it is not only becafise they were Aus-
tralians, because they brought our own
land to life to us, that we value Steele
Rudd and Lawson ; it is because, describ-
ing the life they knew “in their bones,”
they wrote with complete conviction.
Letty Fox. though one would not
question the profundity of Christina.
Stead’s mind, seems shallow and super-'
ficial, not at all a true picture of the
American scene, without a single
memorable character among the many
brilliant sketches, not real as Sinclair
Lewis’s novels are real. If it were better
constructed, so that it stayed in the mind
as a unity and as a drama. Tidal Creek
might well be permanently cherished in
New Zealand literature as the first thing
of its kind—the kind of On Our Selection.
Parts of it may indeed have a permanent
life as short stories, for it is completely
natural, unselfconscious, indigenous writ-
ing such as New Zealand has hardly
known except in the few of Katherine.
Mansfield’s stories (her best) set in her
native land. The New Zealand earth is
alive in Tidal Creek, and Uncle Ted, some
of the assorted hermits and hatters who
populate the neighboring countryside,
and, especially, the Maoris Monday
Wiremu and Rua are all solid and de-
lightful pieces of characterisation.
Both novels are near-misses. Both
fall short for the same reason: faulty
construction. Because they do not move
with a sure and increasing pace, in a
definite direction, they are both difficult
to read because they do not at the last
reach an inevitable climax they do not, in
their entirety, make on the mind a forcible
and enduring impression.
Letty Fox, because it is bigger and
more complex, because it is bizarre in
many of its incidents and because
Christina Stead is always deeply exciting
in style and thought, provides a much
richer feast of entertainment as it goes
along than does Tidal Creek, in which the
incidents are sparse and rather tame, with
sudden patches of color like gorse on a
bare hillside. Tidal Creek reads quietly,
almost weakly; Letty Fox clamorously
and strongly. But Tidal Creek is only
mildly difficult to read because of its lack
of continuity, whereas Letty Fox is diffi-
cult to the point of impossibility—a
monstrous novel, as hard to get through
as a concrete wall 20ft. thick and crowned
with barbed-wire and broken bottles.
Tidal Creek only just manages to come
into the category of the novel as distinct
from a collection of short stories. In a
rough sort of way there are two lines of
development, two continuous themes —
the growth of a boy through an adolescent
love affair to manhood, and Uncle Ted’s
movement from a cranky middle-age into
an old-age when he is contented with his
farm and when the neighbors, because
they think he is heir to an English
baronetcy, come to regard even his eccen-
tricities with respect. But there are gaps
in the handling of these themes; the boy
Jake barely comes to life as a character;
the district is too lightly sketched-in.
Finlayson has not yet proved that he can
cross the divide that separates the short-
story writer from the novelist.
His method of telling the story in the
present tense may be a handicap. It is a
■pleasant device for comedy, but its range
is limited; a profundity of meditation
like Christina Stead’s is beyond it, as also
is any sort of drama except the comic.
It is a way of telling a story in a
humorous tone of voice ; and it can only
be carried through successfully if the
writer can maintain an unbroken flow of
high spirits.
The fault in Letty Fox is, basically, our
told friend Social Purpose. Christina Stead
has not, one feels, seriously set out to
make an immortal character of Letty Fox
as a modern amoureuse on the grand
scale—a female Don Juan—but rather to
describe a given set of social conditions
in America. True, the novelist has not
made the final mistake of trying to reform
these conditions, but the social or
scientific purpose remains. Letty Fox is
a kind of report for Mass Observation ;
an overcolored report, one cannot help
feeling. If she is not a propagandist
dummy, Letty is still a dummy.
As in Finlayson’s case, the method is
also a handicap. Letty Fox tells the
rstory in the first-person, not as an ob-
server (a device which
sometimes works well enough), but, to a
large extent, as the central character. She
is obliged to describe herself as witty,
beautiful and clever, which leaves the
reader embarrassed, feeling that she is
conceited ; and, worse, unconvinced,.feel-
ing that she does not exist.
Still another fault of construction —
Christina Stead has never yet disciplined
her writing into form —is the handling of
'time. The novel begins in the present,
when Letty has just moved into a flat of
her own ; then the story dives into the
past, into Letty’s recollections of her
childhood and girlhood ; and not until the
last chapter does it catch up to itself
again. The reader, led by the opening to
expect that Letty is going to move for-
ward in time, is dragged back and back
into the past; a process as irritating and
as fatal as being drowned. The flashback
'device, as used by Conrad in The Rover,
can achieve, very fine effects ; but Letty
Fox, from the first page to the last, is one
gigantic flashback, prolonged till the flash
has wasted to a flicker, to ashes.
Lastly, there is the question of the in-
trinsic interest of the novel. If one can
be interested, when the story is told with
fidelity and high spirits—as Finlayson, at
least in patches, tells the story of Uncle
Ted —in the way a farmer makes his liv-
ing in an “outpost of the pakeha” among
the Maoris of North Auckland, one
should surely be interested in a girl who
has some 847 (or 93,502) love affairs in
New York. So, up to a point, one is.
Such a prodigious quantity of love is not
to be sneezed at. But then, Letty Fox's
affairs become statistical; and statistics
are tedious. When love is as cheap and
as plentiful as this it becomes meaningless.
Ylt is like floods in China, like poisoning
in the time of the Borgias: a' common-
place.
Both these novels, the urban and the
rustic, are worth reading ; both stand a
chance of lasting. But neither is satis-
factory as a work of art. If they do last
it will be because of their incidental
rather than their fundamental virtues and
because of the reinforcement that later
and better-constructed work may give
them.
The First Prime Minister.
Of the 197 pages of John Reynolds’s
Edmund Barton (Angus and Robertson)
132 are taken up with the fight to
establish Federation and Barton’s leader-
ship of the first Commonwealth Parlia-
ment. The running—and sometimes limp-
ing—story leaves the reader constantly
casting about for something more.
Barton handicapped his biographer by
leaving no diary, few papers and, it
appears, few letters. Yet, to bring color
to the book, the author should have
tackled a larger canvas. “Toby” Barton
lived through a mighty section of Aus-
tralian history, and was accorded the first
place among the makers of the Federa-
tion.
After recording that he would sit
talking in the Atheneum Club “for
far more time than he could justify
in the light of his position as a
professional man with heavy family re-
sponsibilities,” and that there were “other
interesting diversions for such a good
companion and bon viveur” Mr.
Reynolds devotes great space and effort,
pages of it, to defending Barton from the
charge of laziness. The quotation of a
long passage from Deakin’s description
of him at the 1891 convention —his
“beautiful black eyes glowing like jewels”
notwithstanding—hardly helps the de-
fence. The author calls upon Mr. R. G.
Menzies for a foreword, and Mr. Menzies
selects the protested point for a thrashing
all over again. At page 100 the jury will
have had enough of it, and will be ready
to return a verdict without retiring.
After he resigned from the Speakership
in 1887, Barton went to the Legislative
Council, then back to the Assembly and
came a cropper in the Dibbs Cabinet.
From 1893 till 1897 he was not in Parlia-
ment, but campaigning for Federation in
the country in support of the popular
Federation League. There was certainly
no laziness about him as a crusader in
that cause. But party warfare seems to
have bemused him, and in it he made
some extraordinary mistakes.
One was his joining in 1892 as
Attorney - General the Protectionist
Ministry of Sir George “Republican”
Dibbs (as The Bulletin called him)
shortly after re-election to the Assembly
for East Sydney on a pledge to “sink Pro-
tection” and oppose Dibbs to the death
as Federation’s enemy. The faithful
O’Connor accompanied him as Minister
for Justice, but after 14 months Barton
had to resign, and O’Connor went out
with him. At pages 85-87 Mr. Reynolds
gives as the reason that Barton could no
longer endure the reproaches of the
federalist lieges.
But 40 pages earlier the author had re-
counted the unhappy story of how the
Dibbs Ministry was defeated on a no-
confidence motion concerning Barton’s
extraordinary action, while Attorney-
General, in accepting a brief from a firm
of railway contractors (Proudfoot and
Co.) in a suit against the Railways Com-
missioners. In vain did Barton take the
stand that he was not appearing against
the Grown, because (he argued) the Com-
missioners were advised by their own
solicitor, not the Crown Solicitor, and
that he had a perfect right to private
practice. The Assembly emphatically
thought otherwise. Even Mr. Reynolds
that “to a layman it probably
appeared a little incongruous.”
Nor did Barton readily become
sophisticated in the party game. Parkes
understood this when, his health broken,
he handed over to Barton the leadership
of the Federal cause, but not of the
Freetrade party, although Barton had
already deputised as Premier.
Again, in the first year of the 1898
Parliament (when he reappeared in the
Assembly), being then Leader of the
Opposition against Reid and with Federa-
tion entering the straight, so to speak.
Barton relinquished his leadership to
Lyne, “an uncompromising enemy of the
Convention Bill he had assisted in fram-
ing.” Why Barton should have done this
Mr. Reynolds does not understand, and
his readers are left to find out for them-
selves, if they can.
George Reid had entered the scene
with the 1894 election: the “dry dog,”
the master of his day’s electoral mob, the
who affected at times the
buffoon, the man who really dominated
the local stage for the next few years.
H*. Collis, who has just published a
much lighter contemporaneous volume.
Lost Years (Angus and Robertson), pro-
duces in his scrappy but vivacious
journalists’ reminiscences of men and
events of those days the appeal which
Reid had for the public and which Barton
missed, and Mr. Reynolds misses also.
Reid jumped into the arena with an
election programme for recovery from
the financial crisis, and pledged himself
to right the ship by governing the colony
on £9 millions a year, defence, post-office,
railways and all. He was elected to office
and proved better than his word; he did
the job on £B£ million. Says Mr. Collis:
He abolished most Customs duties and
reduced others. He made N. S. Wales the
best Freetrade country in the world. His
income tax was a model of justice, lucidity
and simplicity. There was a .flat £2OO
exemption for everybody and a flat rate of
tax of 6d. in the pound. His land tax
was a penny in the pound on unimproved
capital value with an exemption of £240.
He took the public service in hand and
pruned its overgrowth. He removed it from
political control and created a non-political
board in which were vested all appoint-
ments. Entrance henceforth was by com-
petitive examination.
Then, at the end of 1895, he went to the
Premiers’ conference at Hobart and per-
suaded it that the proper course to Fed-
eration was not by bargaining among
State Governments but through a conven-
tion elected by the people. It was at the
convention, thus set up in 1897-98, that
Barton again took the political as well as
the popular leadership. But whatever
Barton may have done for the develop-
ment of popular enthusiasm during his
arduous stumping of the country, unques-
tionably Reid prepared the ground among
the State Premiers.
Most of them disliked and distrusted
New South Wales and, as the wrangles at
the 1898-99 convention and subsequent
proceedings showed, with some reason.
Barton may have soothed the convention
to compromise, but it was Reid who in-
duced the N.S.W, Parliament to accept
the compromise and piloted through the
negotiations after the failure in N.S.W. of
the first referendum on the issue. In the
manoeuvrings he found necessary he be-
came known as “Yes-No” Reid, and
Barton as “Australia’s Noblest Son.”
They joined forces for the final refer-
endum bout and carried the day.
The reader will not get all the story
from Mr. Reynolds’s pages, or find it very
clear, except in the Tasmanian section
of it. There were pockets of Tasmanian
opinion in which Barton found a response
after his own heart. Mr. Reynolds has
the grace also to admit that his fellow-
islanders wanted the Victorian duty on
potatoes abolished.
Barton at last found smooth waters, as
first Prime Minister, leading a Ministry
of all the State talents, and then the first
general elections (January-March, 1901)
“the majority of electors supporting the
self-selected Ministerial candidates.” In
Parliament the three parties debated
without any defining any very clear party
platforms, and the leaders kept at least
one ear on what Syme said every morning
in the “Age”:
The Cabinet seems to have divided into
two groups, those who were the personal
friends of the Prime Minister, and the rest
whose association was merely political. [The
former group were Barton, O’Connor,
Deakin and Forrest.] Keating, the Gov-
ernment Whip in the Senate, has described
how the four would meet in the Prime
Minister’s room and discuss all subjects
under the sun into the early hours of
the morning, and often before departing
they cooked chops and made billy tea in
the open fireplace in bush fashion.
In August, 1903, Barton was found in a
state of collapse on the floor of his office
at Parliament House. Deakin and other
colleagues urged him to take a Judge-
ship in the newly-created High Court.
On September 23 Barton resigned and
accepted an appointment to that Bench,
but before he did so he offered the posi-
tion of Chief Justice to Sir Samuel
Griffith, who accepted.
That act was in keeping with Barton’s
fine character. Mr. Reynolds’s chapter on
Barton’s term as High Court Judge
(1903-20) is the shortest in the book.
Barton died suddenly at Medlow Bath
on January 7, 1920. Deakin had died
shortly before him, and with Griffith’s
passing a few months later went the last
of the leading Federalists.

stones on the highways, the Mayflower

ing amid such a forest of props, the w
characters are dim. Sir Anthony Trevis
fares better than the rest, distinguishing
himself by his liking to dress as a billy-
goat and entertain at the witches’ “sab-

1. Cleanse the area thoroughly and
dry,
2. Select a large Elastoplast dressing
and remove the protective muslin.
3. "Without touching the antiseptic
pad, place if over wound, slightly
stretching dressing along the knee.
4. Finally, firmly press down adhe-
sive edges.
The wound is now comfortably and
securely protected whilst the dressing,
being elastic, allows the knee complete
freedom of movement. Elastoplast is
first-class first-aid—you need no band
ages or other antiseptic. Never neglect
an injury, however slight—if in doubt
see your doctor.

How to remove smoke-stains from
a white marble mantelpiece?
Scour with powdered pumice or a
grit scrubbing-powder to remove the
surface,;, deposit, then make a solution
of trisodium phosphate and chlorin-
ated lime as follows: Dissolve 21b.
of trisodium phosphate crystals in
Igal. hot water. Mix the contents
of a 12oz. can of chlorinated lime to
a paste in a shallow enamelled pan
by adding water slowly and mashing
the lumps. Pour this and the
trisodium phosphate solution into a
stoneware jar and allow the lime to
settle. For use, fold a white flannel
cloth to form three or four layers
and saturate it in the liquid. Paste
this over the stain, making sure the
cloth is pressed firmly against the
surface. Re-saturate the cloth as
often as is necessary.
What is (1) Rosicrucianism, and
(2) some details about the fraternity
known as Amorc?
(1) A system of mystical and meta-
physical philosophy intended to guide
the development of the inner con-
sciousness. (2) A fraternity generally
known throughout the world as the
Ancient Mystic Order of Rosae Crucis,
often abbreviated to the initials
“A.M.0.R.C.” It came to America
from Europe in 1694. The name of
the organisation is derived from the
symbol, the cross with a single red
rose in the centre. It is non-sectarian
and in a broad sense rion-religious,
inasmuch as its teachings include the
practical sciences to a greater extent
than principles of religious thought.
For full details see H. Spencer Lewis’s
Rosicrucian Questions and Answers.

How to get rid of cutworms in the
vegetable and flower gardens?
Dig over refuse and plots where
pests have been troublesome and
search for the small grubs which will
be found curled up about lin. below
the surface. Their little “feet-like”
knobs will make them easily dis-
tinguishable from the ordinary ground
worms. Late in the evening put down
baits made of bran (six parts), arsenic
or Paris green (one part), and sugar
(one part). Pets should he kept out
of the area at night. A fortnight’s
treatment will effect a clean-up.

McNULTY THE GREAT
BY
BRIAN JAMES
Everyone
hated Mc-
Nu 11 y, and
mostly cringed
to him, for McNulty
was eminently suc-
cessful and wealthy
and powerful. The
local Irish said he
was a disgrace to Ire-
land so he was;
and no great credit to Australia, neither.
So, if McNulty went to church, they
said it was just hypocrisy and would be
doing him no good at all, for they gave
the Almighty the credit of being able to
see through McNulty. And if he didn’t
go to church, they said it was just like
McNulty to be giving grave scandal in
that way. And it was a lot worse to be
missing church when there it was only
once a month —over at MacMahon’s big
place on the hill, of course —and Father
Kelly driving out forty long miles to
celebrate.
McNulty was, notwithstanding, very
powerful; more so than the local police-
man ; more so than the local squatter,
who was “in the banks,” anyway; more
powerful even than Father Kelly, whose
once-a-month was bound to leave wide
gaps in his influence. The one and only
pub at Coolty Creek was McNulty’s ; the
one and only store was McNulty’s; and
both were goldmines. No mining expert
had yet discovered a surer or more effi-
cient process of extracting the last grain
of metal from stone.
Then, McNulty had the best farm for
many miles round —all the rich flats along
the Coolty Creek. Mostly beef-cattle on
the farm, for it was too far otherwise for
a market; and a paddock or two of oats
and wheat for hay and grain and so forth.
And he bred horses. Good horses, too;
have to give him that —he knew horses.
Then he owned miles and miles of
country in the hills, rough country, but
good enough in the creeks and gullies.
A station in itself, really, and McNulty
had hundreds of cattle
on it.
If you went to the store,
Mrs. McNulty would be
behind the long counter,
and say, as like as not,
“Axe-handles, now? /
don’t know what he
charges for them’’ ; or,
“Cornflour, is it? Well, I
did know the price, but bless me if I
haven’t forgot it.”
And McNulty himself would slide in
at the moment, and make you feel guilty
about axe-handles or cornflour, or what-
ever it was. Mrs. McNulty counted as
nothing in the scheme of things, and was
only a very fat cipher. If you went into
the bar —next door, of course, to the
store —Moira McNulty, who wasn’t half
bad-looking, would be pouring your
drink when McNulty would appear and
make you feel ashamed at your inner-
most thought that Moira wasn’t hard to
look at. And McNulty would condemn
the day, or the weather, or the picnic-
races, or the big fight in Sydney, or what-
ever it was that you tried to introduce
to cover your confusion.
Any picture, so foolishly conceived as
to present a fat and jovial mine host,
vanished in one fleeting contemplation of
McNulty. Tall, thin and sinewy he was,
clean-shaven right down to the fringe
of sandy hair at the bottom of his throat
and peeping out from the top of his shirt;
full sandy thatch, never well trimmed
about the eaves; big ears and small eyes
—with the lines of low cunning about
them ; thin lips, and a mouth that closed
very tight. McNulty didn’t look a man
you could take liberties with, nor the sort
who would relish being “taken in.”
Furthermore, at the ends of his scaly
wrists were large hands. There was a
distinct impression that they were capable
hands.
McNulty was proud of many things,
and was not without affections: he had
pride in his pigs, and could even enthuse
to the extent of saying, as he leaned over
and scratched the back of a perfectly-
shaped baconer, “There’s a pig, if you
like!” And the pig would make a slight
to-and-fro motion with his back to get
the maximum benefit from the scratching,
and grunt softly and appreciatively, as if
to say, “There’s a man, if you like!”
McNulty was proud of his cattle ; and
proud of his horses, and full of affection
for them. His human relationships he
considered as a sort of convenient
nuisance.
On the creek flat he grew cabbages
and potatoes, onions and pumpkins. He
really loved these vegetables—especially
his cabbages. They were as tight as
drums and nearly as big, and never a
grub-hole in one of them. As cabbages
they were perfect and beautiful. McNulty
often patted a particularly big specimen
out of sheer love of it.
Once a cow of Brogan’s got into the
cabbage-patch and ate jagged holes into
several of the biggest plants. Besides
being the owner of that brindle cow,
Brogan was in debt
to McNulty. It was
never disclosed
what McNulty did
and said about the
damage to his cab-
bages, but Brogan
was as a worm
afterwards, which
was quite unlike
the true nature of
a Brogan.
Besides Brogan,
there were many others in McNulty’s
debt: he made it easy to get into his debt,
and very hard to get out of it again.
Neither the frequent getting-in nor the
infrequent getting-out again increased
McNulty’s popularity.
It might be thought that McNulty was
a busy, hustling man, but that would be
a mistake. He never seemed to be in a
hurry at all, and yet he always seemed to
be everywhere at the same time without
the usual processes of getting there. One
moment he would be seen supervising the
unloading of store goods from a wagon,
and almost at the same time he would be
in the bar curtly informing a tramp that
whisky was so much a bottle and not a
penny less ; and when you looked round
again there would be McNulty commun-
ing with his pigs; and then, without get-
ting there, he would appear in his vege-
table-patch leisurely digging potatoes.
Or he might be seen setting out for
Jinnalong, the railway town forty miles
away, and in a ridiculously short space of
time he would be riding back from the
hills with a small mob of steers. Nobody
pretended to know how he managed to
do these things, though it was partly sug-
gested that old Nick had something to
do with it, “if you ask me.”
IT was the winter of the big flood—the
A real big flood when the Coolty ran over
all the flats, and in yellow swirl joined
the mile-wide river lower down —it was
that winter that McNulty’s life under-
went a big change.
A number of events and circumstances
led to the change. The big flood itself
had little to do with it, and is. only men-
tioned to indicate the time, though cer-
tainly McNulty lost a mile of fencing be-
cause of it, and was much embittered
thereby. Other folk lost stock as well as
fences, and they grieved as much over
the fact that McNulty lost no stock as
they did over their own losses. Just the
same, McNulty took the destruction of
his fences pretty hard, and where it was
at all possible—and
it often was —he
made others feel his
displeasure.
But it was that
winter a month
after the floods had
gone down that
Mrs. McNulty died,
though again it
must be emphasised
that the floods had
nothing to do with
the sad event. She had been ailing
for some time, and the doctor had
come out several times from Jinnalong
and could do nothing for her at all. After
all these years with McNulty her death
made really little difference to her con-
sciousness and reasoning faculty. People
said “Poor soul, she’s better off really!”
Which had less reference to Heaven than
freedom from McNulty. In any case, if
she went to Heaven —and none doubted
that —she most assuredly would never
see McNulty again. So, in every way, she
gained by dying.
In other ways, too, McNulty was
deserted. Moira, who was quite an attrac-
tive girl, even if McNulty was her father,
went off to live with her married sister in
a distant town. McNulty didn’t like her
going, and still less the manner of it —
she sneaked off when McNulty was out
at his place in the hills, and never “said
good-bye or anything.” Other folk said
quite a lot, however, and could see the
“finger of Providence working tn a
mysterious way,” as old Podsmore put it.
Others said that “McNulty’s chickens
were coming home to roost,” though that
didn’t sound quite so good a description
of McNulty’s domestic affairs.
McNulty had two sons—one of them a
“wild divil” and now generally supposed
to be in jail somewhere for something.
At least there was a pious hope that he
was in jail, and a unanimous conclusion
that it was most unlikely that he would
be anywhere else. The other son was a
hardworking fellow, settled on a small
farm at Jinnalong. “Not a bit like the
old bloke” —and that accounted a fair
tally of all the worth-while virtues.
So McNulty was deprived of all help.
While the help he had had all along had
been inefficient, at least it had been cheap.
But he couldn’t run store and pub, to say
nought of his many other undertakings,
without assistance. He went to see Jack —
the son at Jinnalong—one Sunday about
it. It was Father Kelly’s Sunday at Mac-
Mahon’s. He met the good cleric at the
Coolty Bridge, or
where the bridge had
been before the
flood. McNulty
nerved himself if
that were necessary
—for encounter. But
Father Kelly was a
wise man, and didn’t
tell McNulty he was
going the wrong
way. In fact, he seemed to take for
granted that McNulty should not be going
to MacMahon’s. It puzzled McNulty,
and vaguely annoyed him.
Jack could do nothing to help him,
being, as he described it, “tied hand and
foot” to his place at Jinnalong; and
there were “the wife’s people” to consider,
“and all that.” As a matter of fact, “the
wife’s father,” a shrewd, hardheaded
fellow, had previously warned Jack about
having anything to do with his parent.
McNulty summed up everything fairly
accurately and departed, after paying
Jack the doubtful compliment that he was
“just a sook.”
McNulty decided that with a house-
keeper, a good reliable sort of woman, in
the pub, and
keeping an eye to
the store when he
himself wasn’t
about, he could
manage. He got
into urgent touch
with a Sydney
agency. This
agency was con-
ducted by a bene-
volent lady who mixed sentiment with
business, to the great advantage of the
latter. She replied that she was sending
a “perfect treasure,” and congratulated
McNulty on his good fortune in securing
it, or her.
Very soon after the “perfect treasure”
arrived. Although negotiations for her
coming had been privately conducted, it
was surprising how most people seemed
to have got wind of them. Or it may have
been mere coincidence. Anyway, most
of Coblty Creek had occasion to get
things at the store, or felt the overpower-
ing need of a drink, what time the coach
from Jinnalong arrived. Possibly there
was speculation as to what “she’d be
like,” Whether she’d be a luscious bar-
maid, or just a stout, stem housekeeper.
OUT of the coach stepped the
“treasure.” And it was a vision of
yellow hair. Never had anyone seen so
much yellow hair, or such a shade of it.
A hat covered some of it, but even then
there were masses and masses of it, done
up loosely, with a face set in the middle
of it. But it was the yellow hair that one
saw first and last. Yellow hair! “And
nary a touch of red in it at all!” said
Fergus MacMahon —old Fergus, whose
house was God’s House once a month,
and who should have known better. But
(Continued on page 32.)
Various Verse
The Gully.
One-eyed, the house looks down towards
the gully
that must have died five centuries at least
before the Captain came and claimed the
coast
fifty miles east:
it twists from west to north, and joins the
valley
empty of tribute, its depths empty even
of ghosts of water
and spiked with stout, straight trees,
striving
columns sprung up from seeds sown there
after
the water, dying, had made way for the
living
to shoot and soar like organ-pipes to
heaven.
Hounds put up foxes in its course, they
say—
foxes or other sport. If you will listen
tonight, when lights and books are put
away
and the west wind seeks fiercely to
unfasten
the house from earth
where a weight of moonlight clamps it to
the rocks,
you may hear them questing to the north
in falls of wind; so too may the pricked
fox,
wise in his way to what his life is worth.
Sometimes they scour the fallow, pass the
house
and pour like yelping water down the
chutes
among the black and silver of the trees
that mock their whining chase
with shadowed boles and sly, unburied
roots
and leaves that slide the moonlight in
their eyes;
and sudden chokes and falls
snap off the line and halt them in the race
between the gully’s bony, ruined walls.
There, or it may be in the dry lagoon
on winnowed sand soft as a sleeper’s face
they run in circles underneath the moon.
This and the wind are all the gully has
of tumbling torrent since the Captain
came
and centuries before (so science says,
pointing to tree and stone);
even its name —if it did have a name —
is now unknown,
and with the passing of the tide of days
earth and the trees will patiently erase
its course.. . and think its memory their
own.

KENNETH MACKENZIE.
Middle-aged Bohemians.
Are these the faces of dreamers ?
Leering from smoky corners
Over the rims of their glasses
Haze-darkened, weary and weird;
Their twisted queer features resemble
Strange masks put too near by a fire.
Tortured and altered and ruined;
Surfaces buckled and seared.
Here are the faces of dreamers
Burned in a cauldron of fancies,
Flames fed on the life they deserted,
The lonely, aloof and apart;
Flames fanned and exhausted, rekindled
With small despised faggots of humor
Or the sticks and the stalks of com-
munion ;
Flames gouging, most slowly, the heart.
And yet, with their passionless smirking
At lightly-got loves by their sides,
Restless they seem, and sorrows
Grope at their satires of faces.
Grey smoke grows thicker, obscures
The ruin, the wreck of their features
Until one can vaguely discern there
The original dream, or its traces.
Until with a prickle of knowledge
A profile reveals, for an instant.
Some promise of twenty years past;
A negative printed on streamers
Of thick air; intransient vision
Of beauty imprisoned, unproven.
Set fast in a tower of ivory.
These are the faces of dreamers.

Cautionary.
Be kind to the old man, his sight is bUt
dim,
You should always be nice and respectful
to him,
Give ear to his counsels, his jokes arid
his tales,
And when he is dozing don’t practise
your scales.
He has knots on his fingers and corns
on his toes,
Not seldom a dewdrop depends from his
nose.
His brow it is wrinkled, his scalp it is
bare.
The flies do their rhumbas and tangos
up there.
But you mustn’t laugh at him, my little
dears.
Nor grin at the bushes which grow in
his ears;
Don’t hustle or bustle him, treat him as
though
He were simply perfection (as grand-
fathers go).

Our welfare as a nation is directly linked with the condition of
our farm lands. The conservation of soil and water in our
restricted agricultural areas is so urgent a necessity, so vital a
concern of every citizen, that it has become the dominant feature
of the Government’s rural policy. Erosion at a rate faster than
that which caused the U.S.A.’s notorious "dust-bowl” has so
impoverished some districts as to force the abandonment of
once richly producing properties.
Foremost in our Commonwealth plan for soil conservation and
reclamation is "Caterpillar” Diesel Tractors. For contour fur-
rowing, grading, irrigation schemes, pasture improvement,
water conservation and reclamation of heavily eroded areas,
whether in the hands of Government instrumentalities or the
progressive man on the land, the most efficient and economical
method is by "Caterpillar” Diesel Tractors and Equipment,

CHRISTIANITY’S TIME TO ACT.
The U.SA.’s present U.N.O.
delegate, John Foster Dulles, is
widely expected in the U.S. to
become next Secretary of State,
replacing Marshall when (as also
generally accepted) Dewey be-
comes President. Hence the kind
of man Dulles is and his world-
outlook have much more than
U.S. interest, and these can be
clearly seen in the following ex-
tracts from his recent address
before the Assembly of the
World Council of Churches in
Amsterdam, on the theme that
now is the time for Christianity
to assert itself and act:
“This is a time for the
Churches to expose the evil of
war and its futility. Many are
talking about war as though it
were an unpleasant but neces-
sary remedy for existing ills.
The fact is that another world
war would engulf all humanity
in utter misery and make almost
impossible the achievement of
the good ends for which, no
doubt, the combatants would
profess "to be fighting. At times
war may have to be risked as
the lesser of two evils. But there
is no holy war.
“War is evil. Over the ages
violence has repeatedly been in-
voked for noble ends. That
method is dramatic and exciting.
It seems to promise quick and
decisive results, and, at times, it
inspires fine and sacrificial quali-
ties. But violent methods breed
hatred, vengefulness, hypocrisy,
cruelty and disregard of truth.
Because of such evils wars have
seldom accomplished lasting
good, and there is not reason to
think that new war now would
accomplish any good.
“The Churches can, and
should, say these things and de-
velop a stronger public opinion
against war. But that part of
the Churches’ task is the easier
part. War has been recurrent
throughout the ages, despite its
generally acknowledged evilness
and most men’s preference for
peace. For that there must be
some basic cause. The Churches’
further and harder task is to
discern that cause and show how
it can be overcome.”
* * * *
“At this point the Churches
can make a decisive contribu-
tion. Two great principles are
involved. One is recognition that
there is a moral law and that it
provides the only proper sanc-
tion for man-made laws. The
other principle is that every
human individual, as such, has
dignity and worth that no man-
made law, no human power, can
rightly desecrate.
“Both of these concepts rest
on fundamental religious
assumptions. Belief in a moral
law flows from the assumption
that there is a divinely ordained
purpose in history, that moral
considerations are ultimate and
that man, through his laws, can-
not disregard the moral law with
impunity, just as he cannot dis-
regard the physical laws of the
universe without wrecking him-
self.
“Belief in the dignity and
worth of the individual flows
from the assumption that the
individual is created by God in
His image, is the object of God’s
redemptive love and is directly
accountable to God. He there-
fore has a dignity and worth
different than if he were only a
part of the natural order. Men,
born to be children of God, have
rights and responsibilities that
other men cannot take from
them.
“Experience shows that when
men organise a society in ac-
cordance with these two basic
beliefs, they can, within such
society, have peace with each
other.”
* * * ♦
“Marxian Communism is
atheistic and materialistic. Its
leaders reject the concept of
moral law. There is, says Stalin,
no such thing as ‘eternal
justice’; laws are merely the
means whereby those in power
cany out their will, and human
beings have no rights that are
God-given and therefore riot
— N. Y. "World-Telegram
"THE MUSIC GOES ROUND AND ROUND,
BUT NOT A THING COMES OUT."
subject to be taken away by
man.
“So, while some good things
have been done for the prole-
tariat, both theory and practice
involve coercing, terrorising and
liquidating those whose reason
and conscience compel them to
reject the order sought to be
imposed. There are some simi-
larities between the social and
economic ends that Communists
profess and those that Christians
seek. But the methods taught
are utterly dissimilar, and the
present methods of Commun-
ism are incompatible with peace-.
ful change.
“The Soviet Communist
regime is not a regime of peace
and, indeed, it does not purport
to be. It may not, and I hope
that it does not, want inter-
national war. But if so, that is
a matter of expediency, not of
principle. Violence and coercion
are the accepted methods, class-
war being, however, usually pre-
ferred to national war.
“Within the Communist-con-
trolled States leadership has:
periodically been determined, by
violent purges, and it is fanati-
cally taught that there is, for
Communism, no peaceful path
of development. The recent
Cominform indictment of the
Communist party in Yugoslavia
charged as a grievous offence
that that party believed that
there could be a ‘peaceful
growth’ of Communism in rela-
tion to capitalism. That, it was
pointed out, was the heresy of
Bukharin, who had been exe-
cuted in the purge of 1938. The
true doctrine was that there
must be ‘ever-sharpening’ con-
flict.
“It is inevitable that orthodox
Communism should reject
peaceful ways, except as a
matter of temporary expediency,
because it rejects the moral
premises that alone make pos-
sible the permanent organisation
of peace. Peace can never be
stabilised except by institutions
that seek to reflect the moral
laws and that respect the dignity
of the individual. There always
has been, there always will be,
human spirits that will rebel
against totalitarian dictatorship;
and that fact, in turn, requires
such dictatorships to be violent
and coercive.
“Communist parties control
Governments in 16 countries,
and through them rule nearly
one-quarter of the world’s popu-
lation. Their leadership is
dynamic and it has world-wide
ambitions. That, of itself, makes
it impossible to create at once a
universal organisation of peace
through law, and it confronts
those who seek peace with a
difficult problem.
“It is not a problem that can
be solved by abandoning those
faiths that clash with the Com-
munist creed.... .Also, the prob-
lem cannot be solved by trying
to crush Communism by force.
Collective action may, at times,
be required, pursuant to the
United Nations Charter, to pro-
tect member States or individual
human beings in their Charter
rights. But it would be wrong
and stupid to use violence in
order to convince people that
violence ought not to be used.”
♦ * * *
“Today many who defend the
institutions of the West do so on
purely materialistic grounds,
such as that they have developed
mass production. Such reasons
are inadequate. No political or
social system should pie vail un-
less it is the means whereby men
are consciously trying to bring
human conduct into accord with
moral law and to enlarge the op-
portunity of men to exercise
their human rights and funda-
mental freedoms.”
*. * *
“Of course, Communist power
now limits what can be done in-
ternationally. But also it is the
fact that we have not nearly ap-
proached those limits. If we will
do what now is possible, in a
spirit of universal brotherhood,
we can be sure that present
limits will constantly recede.
They cannot withstand such
unifying influences as we can
thus set in motion.
“The world situation is serious
because of a sharp division. On
the one hand are those who
claim to be seeking the welfare
of the masses but who reject the
moral premises necessary to
make their efforts peaceful and
fruitful. On the other hand are
those who accept the moral
premises necessary for the
organisation of peace but who
have allowed their practices to
seem routine, materialistic and
spiritually unfertile. That divi-
sion will gradually become less
sharp if those who believe in
moral law and human dignity
will make it apparent by their
works that their political prac-
tices are, in fact, being made to
serve their faith.
“As we thus analyse the world
situation, Christian responsi-
bility emerges as an inescapable
fact.”
Stalin Promises.
A report in N. Y. “Herald-
Tribune” states that, after the
weeks of fruitless Moscow bick-
ering, the Western Ambassadors
were “surprised and relieved”
when Stalin asserted that the cur-
rency and other problems in-
volved in the Berlin crisis were
largely technical, and proposed
that Marshal Sokolovsky,
General Clay and the French
and British commanders in Ger-
many should be instructed to
negotiate ,an agreement. He
promised to instruct Sokolovsky
to carry on the negotiations in a
businesslike manner.
Stalin’s proposal, the report
adds, was accepted in good faith.
Stalin was not present at the
final Moscow meeting, at which
Molotov and Vyshinsky showed
very little enthusiasm for the
Stalin formula. But, apart from
being more than ordinarily dis-
agreeable, Molotov and
Vyshinsky appeared to be ready
to go ahead with it. Accord-
ingly, instructions to the Russian,
American, British and French
zonal commanders in Germany
were dispatched. This was the
high-water mark of hopes in
Washington, London and Paris.
Stalin had specifically agreed
that establishment of genuine
Four-Power control of the Berlin
currency should be the aim of
the new talks. Either the Soviet
dictator changed his mind, or his
mind was changed by the Polit-
buro. As soon as the Berlin
talks began, it became obvious
that Sokolovsky’s instructions
were quite different from what
had been promised in Moscow.
An exclusive Russian veto on
al! questions concerning the
Berlin currency was only one of
Sokolovsky’s demands. The
sum of his minimum proposals
was that the Russians should
gain total economic and political
power in Berlin, in exchange for
lifting their illegal blockade of
the city.
Stalin, the report asserts, “gave
clear evidence of wanting a
Berlin settlement, referring re-
peatedly to the urgent need to
lift the Western Powers’
economic counter-blockade of
the Russian zone of Germany.
Probably the activists in the
Kremlin got to him after the
meeting and persuaded him to
break his promises, as happened
after Yalta,”
Or, perhaps just as probably,
Stalin thoroughly enjoyed the
Oriental game of stringing the
Western dupes on.
War Prospects.
Though admitting the risk is
always there, quite a solid array
of American commentators have
maintained, despite the recurrent
alarms, that war has not up to
now been at any time an im-
mediate danger,
A report by a Presidentially-
appointed committee made some
time back and quoted at length
in “Uncabled Additions” recom-
mended U.S. defence measures
implying no expectation of war
this side of 1952. The measures
since taken would seem to have
been based on that expert com-
mittee’s expectations.
“U.S. News and World Re-
port” usually well informed,
though sometimes wide of the
mark in predictions based on its
information has prominently
insisted week after week for
months past that there was no
likelihood of early war, and
other responsible journals have
been almost as confident.
In N. Y. “Times” Hanson W.
Baldwin has reported that “most
competent intelligence officers”
believe “the Russians do not
want war now,” Baldwin de-
clared there were no alarming
intelligence indications of mobi-
lisation or other preparations.
There have been some Soviet
troop movements which could
constitute a threat to Iran,
some slight additions to Soviet
air strength near Western posi-
tions and some special equip-
ment sent to Poland, but these
moves were not regarded as sig-
nificant. Even though there was
more pessimism in Washington
than existed earlier in the year,
“in most minds the fear is long-
term, not immediate.”
As well as there being “no
evidence that the Russians have
the atomic bomb,” various Rus-
sian political and ideological
weaknesses (Tito’s “revolt,”
etc.) are looked upon as having
acted against any Soviet war-
plunge ; and those who have
considered early war unlikely
have also banked on the fact
that “Russian industry is clearly
far inferior to that in the United
States” and also that “Russian
military strength, exaggerated by

some observers, has major weak-
nesses, particularly at sea, in the
air and in certain technical fields
like radar.”
These expectations, however,
could be upset by an “accident”
-.or large-scale incident of suffi-
cient magnitude to cause war;
by Communist weaknesses them-
selves appearing “so threatening
to the rulers in the Kremlin that
they would attempt to unite
their shattered ranks by foreign
war”; and again through either
Russia or the U.S. getting into a
position at Berlin or elsewhere
from which there was np open-
ing for retreat or compromise.
As well as these possibilities,
Baldwin includes danger through
a “mistake by either side” —on
the Soviet side because of bad
information regarding the U.S.,
and on the U.S. side because
“too many in Washington have
the ‘Red jitters’ and have
worked themselves into a frame
of mind where war seems the
only outcome.”
Main U.N.O. Tasks.
A mere stating of the main
things U.N.O. now has to deal
with, apart altogether from the
eleventh-hour, addition of Berlin,
indicates how far the divided
nations are from the co-opera-
tion without which U.N.O. must
continue a futility, peace must
remain a distant dream and the
“cold war,” at least, must con-
tinue, and get worse.
Other issues, which would
have been more than enough
without Berlin, include atomic-
energy control and disarmament,
the Balkans, Korea, Palestine,
the Italian colonies, continuance
of the Little Assembly, and
moves to modify use of the veto.
On atomic-energy control no
result is expected. There could
have been accomplishment,
great accomplishment, if action
had been taken on the Atomic
Energy Commission’s recom-
mendation for the establishment
of an international system of
control and inspection (Decem-
ber 31, 1946). As is well known,
that was blocked by Soviet
Russia, which emphatically re-
fused to accept such a system ;
it sought a “gentlemen’s agree-
ment,” the U.S, and the rest
taking the Soviet word for it.
On that deadlock a U.N.O.
correspondent of N. Y. “Times”
has made an interesting com-
ment. He describes the refusal
to accept the plan as a major
Soviet blunder, “since the United
States Congress would probably
have refused to ratify it, and
the Soviet Union could then
have accused the U.S. of reneg-
ing on its offer.”
That seems a very doubtful
back-reading of what would
have happened. Had the Kremlin
agreed, accepted world-control
and -inspection in return for
promised outlawing of atom
bombs and destruction of the
U.S. stockpile of them, the U.S.
must have gone on with its
undertakings.
In fact, the real deterioration
in U.S.-Soviet relations dates
from that Soviet refusal to co-
operate. Going on ever since
then, the deterioration has now
reached the stage where it would
plainly be idiotic for the U.S. to
change the attitude it has
adopted. The world simply is
not the world it was when the
offer was made. History can
now only record the fact that
it was one of the most generous
offers ever made by any nation
in the interest of world peace.
The present atomic-energy
position of the U.S., as stated
by the quoted N, Y. “Times”
writer, is: “The U.S. Govern-
ment now thinks it is safer to
keep the ‘secret’ of the atomic
bomb —actually, of course, a
matter of the unsurpassed in-
dustrial resources of the United
States —rather than turn it over
to countries that are exposed to
attack by the Soviet armies.
Anyone who has sensed the un- ‘
easiness in France over the
future can appreciate the reasons
for the U.S. decision.”
Hence, in the present U.N.O.
meeting, nothing much can be
anticipated from the atomic de-
bates ; and the same applies to
the debates on the equally fruit-
less efforts to bring about dis-
armament. The Kremlin will
not agree to effective inspection,
even if the U.S. would now do
so, which is doubtful. And that
makes all the U.N.O. talk so
much humbug.
The Palestine issue is one
U.N.O. may find much less easy
to finalise than it is to describe.
It is simply whether U.N.O. can
have its decisions respected in
—Washington “Post."

making peace between Israel and
the Arab States.
U.N.O.’s involvement in the
disposal of the Italian colonies
comes from the “Big Four”
pledge in the Italian peace treaty
that, if they could not agree
among themselves on those
colonies, they would carry out
whatever the General Assembly
decided.
The Balkans issue is one of
the West supporting and the
Soviet satellites opposing con-
tinuance of the Balkans Com-
mittee, keeping its useful watch
on the Greek frontiers. The
committee’s watch can be
chalked up as a U.N.O. achieve-
ment: it has certainly aided in
the tough job of bringing re-
covery to Greece, since without
it Soviet assistance to the Greek
Communists would have been
far greater.
In Korea the question is one
of the General Assembly back-
ing the U.S. action of setting up
the Korean Republic regime at
Seoul as a Provisional Govern-
ment for all Korea,
The Little Assembly debate
will turn on'whether this tem-
porary standing group is to be
permanently established.
The veto issue turns on pro-
posals for preventing its further
abuse by Soviet Russia —a de-
bate unlikely to get anywhere,
since without the veto each great
Power would be called on to do
the bidding of U.N.O. whether
it agreed or not, and none of
them would agree to that.
As an addition to the fore-
going—all of them really pieces
of the one basic problem, the
breakdown of co-operation—the
U.S, has another sort of head-
ache for U.N.O. At present
footing the U.N.O, cost to the
tune of 40 per cent., the U.S., it
would seem reasonably enough,
wants this cut down to 25 per
cent.
Nobody expects U.N.O. to get
anywhere on the real root ques-
tion of co-operation. On the
other hand, no nation —not even
Soviet Russia —wants the stigma
of responsibility for breaking up
U.N.O. This gives it a chance
of surviving, with the basic issues
pigeonholed, as usual.
U.S. Jap Problem.
While Europe holds the spot-
light, Japan, in the view of
“U.S. News and World Report,”
remains as big a problem, if not
a bigger one, for Uncle Sam:
“The vision of Japan as the
workshop of Asia is not
materialising. Industrial produc-
tion is less than 40 per cent of
1930-34 level. Foreign trade is
under 20 per cent, of pre-war
volume, and U.S. foots the bill
for that, providing 90 per cent,
of Japan’s imports. Exports are
a trickle. Inflation is in high
gear. Money in circulation,
16,000,000,000 yen in 1946, has
ballooned skyward, up 15 times ;
now totals 240,000,000,000 yen.”
Also, “The physical damage
left by the war has not been re-
paired. It hampers production.
Trade disruption can’t be healed
until China and South-east Asia
are once more in a position to
swap their raw materials for
Japan’s finished goods.”
Towards getting Japan going
again, easing Uncle Sam’s bur-
den there, “U.S. News and
World Report” states that
reparations are to be “very little
drag on recovery” ; they’re to be
“cut to the bone.” Also,
“Foreign investment is to be en-
couraged to rebuild Japanese in-
dustry. Dollar restrictions are
being eased, permitting Japan to
trade with the sterling area, and
to experiment with barter deals.
Bilateral pacts already promise
increased raw-material imports,
more customers for Japanese
textiles. A sharp increase in Jap
foreign trade is thus to be ex-
pected.”
Friendly Russians.
A voice that seems to come
from a long-forgotten past
breaks out in the “American
Magazine” Alexander Keren-
sky, suggesting a new U.S. policy
towards the Russian people.
The change suggested by
Russia’s one-time Prime Minister
is more strongly differentiating
between his former country’s
Communist Government and its
people. He insists he does not
advocate any encouragement of
an attempted overthrow of that
Government; simply, “With
Russia divided, with the great
mass of its people friendly to
the United States, Stalin would
not dare make any move that
might bring war. Stalin, the
Politburo, the generals and
diplomats even in their most
frenzied moments would hold
back, realising that ahead would
be only defeat, the destruction of
Communism, and the prompt
liberation of Russia from its
chains.”
The U.S.S.R., Kerensky points
out, has a population of about
180.000. but only 6,000,000
are members of the Communist
party. His estimate is that not
more than 20,000,000 Russians
are loyal to the party. These
usually are directly connected
with the Government. “By grant
of the party they live well, they
have comfortable apartments,
some have servants and auto-
mobiles. Their income and their
lives depend upon obedience.”
Among those who hate the
Communists most he names the
slave laborers, whom he puts at
12.000. men and women.
“Held in compounds near cities,
factories and farms, they are
driven out each morning to work
like prisoners of war.”
Also, more than half of the
Russian people are peasants.
who were forced to give up
their land and work on collective
farms. “They live in poverty,
are cheated of the fruits of their
labor. The Russian peasant,
willingly, never has apcepted and
never will accept collective farm-
ing. Nearly 20,000,000 peasant
families long for release from
Communist regimentation.
“Millions of Russians have
been purged because they did
not see eye-to-eye with Stalin,
and the mourning relatives of
these dead join the relatives of
the slave laborers and the exiles
in a smouldering hatred for their
rulers. There is hardly a family
in Russia which doesn’t hope
passionately for revenge for a
monstrous wrong perpetrated by
the Communists.”
Stating that he keeps in close
touch “through reports that
come out of Russia by various
secret channels,” Kerensky de-
clares: “Word comes that in
spite of the fact that the secret-
police ruthlessly murder or throw
into slave-labor camps every
Russian who even appears to
wish for freedom, the people
are daring more and more to
whisper their dissatisfaction.
Sabotage is increasing.”

stration of ‘unconquerable air power l .’
Word from Europe is that Russia is
behind schedule with a modern air
force.”

Presidential Cert. “At least one
poll-taker of national repute, Elmo
Roper, has announced that it’s just
foolishness and a waste of time for
him to take any more polls between
now and the election because the
Dewey-Warren ticket is as good as
elected.” Thus N. Y. “Daily News”
political writer John O’Donnell, add-
ing with much enthusiasm, “Of course
he’s right.”

The Herd Outlook. Judging by
socialising in Britain, where “levelling
has been downward, not upward,
pressing the middle class down to a
proletarian standard rather than rais-
ing the workers to a middle-class
standard, as has occurred with large
groups of skilled workers in the
United States,” and with such stand-
ard of living as there is in Britain
depending on what Mr. Churchill has
called “the American dole,” William
Henry Chamberlin concludes: “If the
future belongs to Socialism —and this
seems a doubtful proposition, because
no system that depends on foreign aid
can be regarded as resting on a very
durable basis —it is a drab and un-
inspiring future, a future for tired and
unambitious people who are willing to
settle for an assured minimum of
permanent poverty.”
* * * *
Europe for the Europeans. —Seeing
no future in a U.S. policy of mere
containment of Soviet Russia, Walter
Lippmann, in N. Y. “Herald Tribune,”
suggests a change, making it the para-
mount objective to “end the occu-
pation of Europe by non-European
Powers and restore to the European
nations the control of the destiny of
jEurope.’’ With such a policy, Lipp-
mann foresees U.S. influence rising:
“For then we should be identified
with the liberation of Europe, with
the pride, honor and hopes of the
Europeans, and not —as 1 think we
are today—with the idea that the
European continent is an expendable
object in the struggle between Russia
and America.”
* * * *
Anti-Semitism. —From yet another
part of Europe (Czechoslovakia) a
London “Times” correspondent re-
ports continuing anti-Semitism, stat-
ing that anti-Jewish feeling has
never been far from the surface in
Slovakia since the war, and there have
recently been signs that the Jews are
increasingly unpopular in Bohemia
and Moravia too. “A curious fea-
ture of the present situation is that
Jews of Czech and Slovak nationality
seem to have less difficulty in getting
permission to emigrate than other
citizens. This is attributed by some
Czechs to better organisation on the
part of the Jews, by others to favorit-
ism, and by a third group to the
authorities’ desire to reduce the
number of Jews in the country.” Just
what is the root cause of all this
nobody ever explains.
* * ♦ *
Tito’s Heresy. —ln a report from
Belgrade, N. Y. “Herald Tribune”
correspondent Homer Bigart describes
the Cominform’s calling upon Tito to
confess heresy or surrender power as
“a historic blunder, the magnitude of
which has not yet been fully compre-
hended by the West.” Here is the
heresy: “There is one fundamental
point of cleavage between the Rus-
sians and the Yugoslavs. Belgrade
demands equality—not equality with
Bucharest or Sofia or Budapest but
equality with Moscow. Yugoslavs are
willing to admit that Premier Stalin
is the spiritual leader and that a
single command is necessary in the
struggle with the West. But they in-
sist on sole management of their
internal affairs, and in rejecting foreign
meddling they are stubborn as only
south Slavs know how to be when
resisting outside pressure.”

“ADVANCE AUSTRALIA FAIR.”
"Immigration-and-Information Minister Calwell, replying to criticism of his action in demanding the return of Australian girls working abroad for the U.S. Government,
said he would like to see the editor of the Melbourne ‘Herald’ in the dock on a charge carrying a seven-years jail penalty, adding: ‘And there are many other people we
Would like to get on a matter of stolen documents.’”
“Come on now, all together; ‘Australia’s sons (and daughters) let us rejoice’!”

LIONS OR ASSES?
Outstanding features of the opening of
the “Conference of Commonwealth
Prime Ministers” in London were (1) the
difficulty apparently felt in giving the
assemblage a name, and (2) the extra-
ordinary reluctance of the Australian
Government, unlike that of Canada, to
restate, in advance of the Conference, at
least the clear principles behind Austra-
lian defence policy. The Chifley Gov-
ernment cannot alter those principles
whether it likes Britain’s commitments
with the Western Union or not.
By general agreement it is not to be
called an Imperial Conference. How
quaint this boggling over an ancient and
honorable title, many times vindicated,
in a generation which finds no incon-
gruity, and shows far less questioning
loyalty, in “adhering” (as the phrase goes)
to the “United Nations”!
If it is not an Imperial Conference,
what is it? A “Conference of Prime
Ministers” is a misnomer, for the three
senior Dominions (if that style also is
not obsolete) are not represented by their
Prime Ministers, though Canada’s Mr.
St. Laurent is Prime Minister-elect.
Whether “Commonwealth” completely
describes the association in the present
state of flux may be doubted, with India
threatening to declare itself a republic
and making warlike noises at Pakistan,
the new South African Government
making reservations about military com-
mitments except against Soviet Russia,
and Asiatic constituent Governments los-
ing enthusiasm in their efforts to recon-
cile a “Commonwealth” with immigra-
tion-restriction laws. Even in Wales the
ghost of Owen Glendower is rising after
six centuries to demand separation of
the principality from England. England!
Only on the hard-headed European con-
tinent does that name live on, with noth-
ing obsolete about it, in political
nomenclature —there, and in the com-
mon tongue of the participants in these
London “family talks.”
It is the sickness of that same con-
tinent of Europe which primarily caused
the summons to this meeting. Under
Russian threats the world is facing an
emergency familiar enough to this war-
torn generation, and it is of first im-
portance that the peoples of the lately
despised British Empire—and that means
not only British peoples—shall for
their own security establish some solid
basis of understanding and military
preparation for any crisis which the
future, and perhaps the near future, may
bring.
In Canberra the Chifley Government
is reported to be “cautious” about sup-
port of the Brussels Treaty (Western
Union). Yet Mr. Chifley, when in Eng-
land three months ago, declared that his
Government “fully approves” the Wes-
tern Allies’ policy in Berlin and “stands
behind them. ...It is the only stand
which can be taken.” Demonstrably the
Allies’ stand in Berlin is in resistance to
the Soviet’s campaign to defeat the Mar-
shall Plan or European Recovery Pro-
gramme ; the Brussels Treaty is a direct
corollary ; the Marshall Plan requires, and
is subsidising, a wider agreement among
Western European States for self-help
and the free exchanges in each other’s
markets, and Mr. Dewey, the likely new
President in U.S.A., is already urging an
equally firm military alliance among
them. If Mr. Chifley is firm in support
of the Anglo-American stand in Berlin
he must therefore support the Western
Union, the Marshall Plan and even that
wider Atlantic Union which would as-
suredly follow any further Russian ag-
gression or the collapse of U.N.O. Why,
then, the “caution”?
If a third world war is threatened the
first consideration, as always, will be Im-
perial communications. The main route
via India, Ceylon, the Suez Canal and
the Mediterranean may be denied us, but
an alternative must be built up through
central Africa ; and so long as there is an
Australian Navy its duty must be to
guard the nearer sea-end of that route.
Our trade interests and our defence
necessities alike demand that. On the
Pacific side Australian war plans must
dovetail in with the overriding prepara-
tions by the United States. That is Can-
berra’s declared policy. Why is not the
policy for our Western flank, no less ob-
vious, also declared? Why the “caution”?
The Australian air arm depends upon
supply of British jet-fighters and Ameri-
can heavy bombers and overseas help in
our aircraft factories. It depends also on
imports of British and American aero-
plane fuel. These essential needs declare
which side we fight on if war comes.
Why, then, the “caution”?
Is it because Canberra dislikes the way
British policy is shaping? Because Em-
pire preferential trade may follow the
Empire into the melting-pot? Because, if
India and Pakistan leave the “Common-
wealth,” as Burma has done, some of the
familiar features of Imperial organisation
for war may vanish? But these are only
secondary considerations in the
threatened emergency. The circumstances
that rule our fate endure. They are that,
as in the beginning, so now and hence-
forth, Australia cannot remain neutral
when Britain’s power is challenged, and
especially, in the new Pacific era, when
America’s power is challenged along
with Britain’s; that we have no resort
but to exert all our energies with them in
such event; that if any Australian Gov-
ernment, in such emergency, did hesitate,
Australian manhood would mobilise itself
and enlist under other flags. Mr. Chifley
cannot require telling one word of this.
Why, again, the “caution”? The situa-
tion is made for Australia to declare itself
at once.
Are there “pangs and inhibitions”
about calling the Communist
“philosophy” by its right name? Cer-
tainly Canada and South Africa are more
resolutely opposed to Communism than
the Socialist Governments in Britain,
Australia and New Zealand. But how
long would any of those Socialist Gov-
ernments last if the people thought their
policy for confronting a Russian bid for
world domination was to remain neutral?
For Britain, however, that question does
not arise. Britain is already committed
by the Brussels Treaty, with France, Bel-
gium, Holland and Luxemburg, to a 50-
year pact of military alliance and eco-
nomic co-operation in the cause of re-
storing the civilisation and political free-
dom of Europe and upholding, along
with any others who stand with them, the
principles of the United Nations Charter.
Britain can no more leave Europe in the
lurch than Australia can leave Britain.
The Western Union is only the first-
fruit of the four-year Marshall Plan. The
Chifley Government wants to buy into
that plan. It wants to earn dollars from
“off-shore” purchases from the American-
provided E.R.P. funds. It wants —quite
properly—to make sure that, if under
E.R.P. or the international trade agree-
ment, or both, the markets for Australian
exports, long guaranteed by Imperial
trade preferences, should be imperilled,
then alternative markets will be assured
under the New Order. But these con-
siderations should not create in Mr.
Chifley “caution” about supporting
Britain as a member of the Western
Union. No clinging to the sanctity of
Imperial preferential tariff agreements of
the pre-war years can ignore that those
British and European markets we relied
on are devastated, and that only Ameri-
can aid under the Marshall Plan can re-
store them. To that end thoroughgoing
co-operation and self-help among the
Western European nations, including
Britain, are required by America as a
prerequisite condition.
In what element does the Western
Union, as a regional pact, differ from
Dr. Evatt’s much-advertised Anzac pact
with New Zealand? Or is it that Mr.
Chifley, while happy enough in pursuing
an economic revolution of his own, feels
strong resentment against an economic
revolution engineered by somebody else?
Warning In the Skies.
Early last week the urban populace on
the eastern Australian coast went out to
gather the milk and the morning paper
and was startled to observe red curtains
of dust hanging over sea and land. No
such phenomenon had been observed
since the drought years of 1944-45, and
a lot of people, not having heard of any
drought, believed that it must be some
sort of weather freak. But it was dust
all right, brought from inland on high
winds that battered towns, troubled ship-
ping and grounded aircraft over the
eastern half of the continent. Press and
radio soon carried news of wreckage
ashore and afloat, with some loss of life ;
and on the N.S.W. North Coast, accord-
ing to A.8.C., pastures were so covered
with dust that the stock couldn’t get at the
grass to eat it.
Apart from the inevitable exaggeration
associated with such visitations the dust
was real enough, and because most people
associate dust with drought, and about the
only known drought then in circula-
tion was in outback Queensland, they
were puzzled to account for the haze.
There was no puzzle about it. As was
here remarked back in 1944, and as can
be remarked now and will probably be
•remarked again and again, “beyond the
coastal ranges, right across the vast con-
tinent, topsoil is being blown away.” At
the end of 1944 erosion was a big topic
because the dust-storms that year were
spectacular. The skies were red for weeks.
Press, radio and newsreels featured
erosion. Reporters, photographers and
artists went into the back-country, some-
what amazed at their own enterprise, and
sent back articles and pictures to astound
the city folk. There were debates in
Parliaments and in those earnest little
suburban “discussion groups.” The Com-
munist party even identified it as another
capitalist plot.
Presently there came the long-delayed
rain. The dust stopped, erosion ceased
to be news, and there was no more about
it. But erosion is a continuing disaster ;
it goes on day and night, without pause,
all the time. The dust-storms which in-
frequently startle coastal-dwellers are
regular features of the summer months
outback —so regular, indeed, that it has
to be one of unusual thickness and dura-
tion to get through to the columns of a
city newspaper.
In the Victorian and South Australian
Mallee districts the clearing of drifts from
railways and roads and water-channels is
now a regular and ever-more-costly task.
In western Queensland the stock-carrying
capacity of the grazing lands is steadily
falling. The great plains of N. S. Wales
are no better off. To all this can be
added the steady loss of soil by water-
washing, the steady diminution of the
water-flow on the catchments of the great
river systems, the silting of dams large
and small, the falling of the underground
levels in the sub-artesian basin.
And, during the past couple of years,
wind and water acquired a powerful ally
in the rabbit. So much has this destroyer
of pastures and soil-holding shrubs multi-
plied that it has actually been praised as
a “dollar-earner” because of the millions
of rabbitskins exported in recent months.
A dollar-earner! For every dollar it
earns it does pounds’-worth of damage.
Its incisive little teeth are eating at the
heart of the country. Where it has bared
the earth of verdure the high winds blow
the unprotected soil away.
It isn’t as though Australia was without
voices urgently calling a warning. By
all means at their disposal scientists and
Government soil-officers, landmen and
others have striven for public and poli-
tical appreciation of what is close to being
the nation’s worst, and certainly its most
continuous, menace. They have received
little reward. Here and there a State
Government grants a small amount of
money—usually no more than a State
Premier spends on a trip abroad —for
erosion-control experiments or to plant
a tree or snag a creek, and now and
again a field day is held at one or other
erosion-control station. There are soil-
conservation departments, starved of staff
and money, and with no power to do the
things that ought to be done. In short,
the Governments fiddle with the thing as
they fiddled with it before the war.
Nothing short of an appreciation that
it is a national work, requiring a national
body to do it, will serve. That body will
need to be equipped with adequate staff,
funds and authority. It will either have
to absorb or co-ordinate the existing State
bodies, and from that nucleus create the
expanding department. It will have to
begin with a general survey of the entire
field of erosion, ignoring State boundaries,
and then set about dividing the Common-
wealth into soil-conservation districts, fol-
lowing the American pattern of forming
the affected landholders into committees
to administer the necessary cures to
eroded, eroding and erodable lands, fail-
ing water-catchments and dying forests.
Perhaps it can’t be done. Perhaps no
Australian political party, having become
a Government, would be game to use the
necessary compulsion and set aside the
vast necessary sums for the gigantic task.
They thought like that in America before
1933. Then dust-storms arrived, the food
supplies to the cities stopped and
thousands left the land, and it was the
cities, not the country, which demanded
action. If it can’t be done in Australia
we might as well stop talking about popu-
lation and immigration and future de-
velopment. There is no future without
the land; and between them wind and
water, rabbit and improvident landholder
are wasting the land. If it can’t be done
in Australia it won’t be long before dust-
curtains hang in the skies every day, and
the coastal-dwellers will live as do the
poverty-stricken and decadent inhabitants
of the eroded Mediterranean lands. By
that time there won’t even be rabbits to
eat, and whether or not old-age pensioners
get another five shillings a week won’t
matter a tinker’s cuss.
Not-So-Local Government.
Twelve months ago Mr. Cahill, N.S.W.
Minister for Local Government, who
understands the word “local” to be a
synonym for “centralised,” said he
“doubted whether people in the mass gave
much thought to municipal boundaries
and areas.” Acting on that belief, he
pushed ahead with “Labor’s” Greater
Sydney plan, first conceived when Mr.
McKell, of Yarralumla, was Mr. Lang’s
offsider in Macquarie-street —though his
doubts did not deter him from thrusting
upon “people in the mass” the unsought
boon of a compulsory vote at municipal
elections.
It requires quite a lot of thought to
follow the tortuous course of Mr. Cahill’s
amalgamation policy for the County of
Cumberland. In 1945 a Royal Commis-
sion was appointed to make recommen-
dations for the extension of the City of
Sydney and the reconstitution of other
areas in the county. The Commissioners
were generous; they handed in not one
report, but three. Mr. Haviland, an
officer of Mr. Cahill’s department, recom-
mended reducing the 66 municipalities
and shires to eight—one of them, Greater
Sydney, to absorb 39 existing councils.
Mr. Storey, Mayor of Drummoyne and
representative of the Local Government
Association, was in favor of 37 munici-
palities ; Judge Clancy 18.
Mr. Cahill chose the Haviland Eight
Cities plan, but, bowing to a storm of pro-
tests, agreed to defer the matter awhile
—there was a State election to be faced.
On the hustings he avoided the subject
of amalgamations, though Opposition
candidates came out strongly against it,
but as soon as he was safely back at the
old address he told the Local Govern-
ment Association that he was going ahead
with the liquidations, gave them 10 days
to suggest alternative proposals, and
warned them that he would reject any-
thing less than the Storey plan. Faced
with this ultimatum, the association re-
luctantly recommended the Storey plan,
with modifications. Mr. Cahill ignored
them and the three Commissioners and
produced his own 14-cities plan, with a
Greater Sydney stretching from Middle
Harbor to Botany Bay, but excluding
Mr, McGirr’s Bankstown and Mr.
Parry’s Canterbury. By the time he
steered his bill through the Assembly—
a rush job, as he wanted the measure
through in time for November, 1947,
elections tp be held on the basis of the
new boundaries —he had yielded to pro-
tests from Mosman and Strathfield and
increased the number to 16. An Opposi-
tion move to have the question referred
to the people failed, although the Royal
Commission had said
We feel that in determining the scope of
the ideal local-goverment unit it must
be made certain that the unit will have a
mandate direct from the electors.
The Liquidation Bill unexpectedly ran
aground in the Legislative Council, that
House referring it to a Select Committee,
whereupon the Minister deferred the
municipal elections for a twelvemonth.
Eight months passed by, and the com-
mittee made its recommendations. In
its view the ideal number of municipali-
ties was 41. After some behind-the-
scenes conferring with the Government
the figure was reduced to 39, and the-
bill was returned to the Assembly with
that suggestion. The Assembly accepted
the 39-municipalities plan. There were
some extraordinary features about the
acceptance. The Minister, who had set 16
councils as his upward limit, accepted
39, two more than the Storey plan he
turned down last year. Several “Labor”
members spoke strongly against the mea-
sure —in committee Speaker Lamb re-
ferred to it as “a flagrant violation of
the fundamental principles of the demo-
cratic system”—yet, when the Opposition,
taking the stand that the people should
have been consulted in the matter, called
for a division, “Labor” members voted
for it to a man.
On paper Mr. Cahill seems to have taken
a hiding; but as far as Greater Sydney'
is concerned “Labor” has probably goj.
what it has been after for years. In the
course of the behind-the-scenes talks
referred to Newtown, Erskineville,
Alexandria and Waterloo were added to,
the City of Sydney. These, with “Labor”
strongholds Glebe, Redfern, Paddington
and Darlington already included, may en-
able “Labor” to dominate the Greater
Sydney Council.
Elections for all municipalities in the
County of Cumberland will take place
on December 4. Voting is compulsory,
and the councillors elected will hold
office for two years. A few days
ago Mr. Cahill told a local-govern-
ment conference at Katoomba that “if,
councils did not enforce compulsory
voting they would create conflict between
the Government and themselves.” Evi-
dently he had been studying the returns, 1
for the Greater Wollongong council
elections held on October 9. Only 5 0
p.c. of electors voted, and the “Labor”
ticket was soundly thrashed.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Fifth-column Stunts.
For his meeting in Sydney last week-end
with union representatives, called to hear
yet another appeal for “more produc-
tion,” Mr. Chifley had ample text in a
new ebullition of industrial strife through
eastern Australia. It included:
xt £omplete stoppage on the southern
N.S.W. coalfields and the threat of a general
stoppage on all fields. Here the war is be-
tween the Communist Miners’ Federation
and the anti-Communist A.W.U. over the
question whether A.W.U. hands working
cm the Kemeira tunnel should be forced to
join the Miners’ Federation.
A strike of ships’ painters and dockers,
extended to all Australian ports, against an
award of Conciliation Commissioner Galvin
m a dispute between that union and the
Operative Painters’ union: 5000 men idle,
and others to be involved.
With Kembla steelworks already closing
down because of coal shortage, the Com-
munist ironworkers’ executive refused to
accept increased wages at Newcastle and
Kembla steelworks, granted by the N.S.W.
Industrial Commission Full Bench, and
mass meetings resolved that the union
should refuse henceforth to appear before
Mr. Justice Cantor.
Victorian slaughtermen on strike against
a new wages award as being insufficient. In
Sydney also 10 striking electricians have im-
perilled maintenance of plant at Homebush
abattoirs.
Inter-union dispute stopped bread-making
in Melbourne and larger Victorian towns.
Running all through this insurgence is
defiance of arbitration authorities. It is
no coincidence that Communist bosses in
most of the unions involved have raised
this flag of rebellion as the intensive
export season begins, and on the coal-
fields at a time when there are the gravest
doubts about sufficient coal being mined
to provide stocks to carry the country
over the miners’ Christmas holidays.
The Miners’ Federation’s war against
the A.W.U. on the South Coast coal-
fields has already spread to Lake
George zinc-and-lead mining, and is
declared by A.W.U. spokesmen to be part
of a Communist plan to drive the
A.W.U, out of all mine-working in
Australia. In Brisbane, for instance, the
miners’ general secretary told the Coal
Tribunal that his executive had “decided
that in the event of coal production ex-
ceeding demand through the development
of opencut workings, the latter would be
closed down” everywhere in Australia.
And on the Kemeira tunnel inter-union
dispute, the Coal Board has intervened
to order not the miners to resume their
proper work, but the company (Australian
Iron and Steel) to close down work on
the tunnel! Since this is completely pre-
judicing the issue in favor of the Com-
munists against A.W.U., contractors and
company alike, somebody is likely to tell
the Coal Board where it gets off.
The fatal limitation on production
which is throttling Australian industrial
output has already reached a farcical
situation on the northern N.S.W. coal-
fields. At some pits miners ostensibly
on “back-Saturday” work have merely
put in a token appearance and gone
home, drawing their double-pay, because
they had already made up file Saturday
“darg” during the week by exerting them-
selves a little harder.
Mr. Chifley’s recent pit-head address to
northern miners in appeal for more pro-
duction had obviously not the slightest
effect. He may or may not realise that
his “Government” is being subjected to
political blackmail. But it is about time
he exhibited some reaction to this treat-
ment if he is really concerned for the wel-
fare of the country.
Why Chifley Was Angry.
Two things are made clear by the Chifley
Government’s contemptible treatment of
the whole question of security in Aus-
tralia for atomic-research secrets, in-
cluding Ministers’ attitude towards the
Fadden disclosures and the matter of Par-
liamentary privilege.
One is that Mr. Dedman’s denials, which
Mr. Chifley supported, of overseas sus-
picions concerning the safety of such
secrets in Australia have been exposed as
false, and that the Government’s long in-
action against Communist infiltration into
Government departments has now put
Chifley and Co. on the spot. The other is
that Ministers have no respect for the
traditions of Parliament, and that their
attitude on the plain and vital issue of
Parliamentary privilege is of a piece with
the whole Socialist plan to abolish Par-
liament by degrees and substitute first the
rule of Caucus and ultimately govern-
ment under a supreme economic coun-
cil elected by trade-union groups.
The pretences of Ministers deceive
no intelligent elector. At the end of
filly the Australian press buzzed for a
Week over the story of American
and British official fears of betrayal
through Australia of any atomic secrets
that might be passed on to Australian
Government research-workers fears
aroused by the inability of the Australian
Government to give assurances that there
were no employed in the
C.S.LR. or associated Government de-
partments.
How was it possible to dismiss such
suspicions when Dedman himself, in
answer to a question in the House some
time previously, said the “great majority”
of Communist members of the Public
Service held positions in which it would
not be possible for them to have access
to defence secrets? To direct newspaper
questioning at the time of the press re-
ports, Mr. Dedman referred reporters to
the Prime Minister.-He admitted that he
had discussed with Mr. Chiiiey the sub-
ject of these overseas reports before Mr.
Chifley went to England. Incidentally,
“S. M. Herald” published during the
debate a statement from the Federal
Council of the Federation of Scientific
and Technical Workers “released by Mr.
A. McD. Richardson, secretary of the
organisation, who is a Communist.”
The chief document quoted 'by Mr.
Fadden to the House was a report of a
C.S.LR. executive meeting, the authen-
ticity of which is now virtually admitted
by Ministers’ reactions. “Present at the
meeting: Mr. Dedman, Sir David Rivett,
Dr. F. W. G. White, Dr. I. Clunies Ross,
Mr. A. Mountjoy and Mr, G. A. Cook.”
The “document” recorded Mr, Dedman’s
announcement to the meeting of what
BONE AND BLOOD.
“Britain’s Foreign Minister Bevin said he did not want to interfere with Russia. But
Britain would defend itself against Soviet interference.”
“I wouldn’t try, if I were you!”
“the Prime Minister had told him
from high sources in the United
Kingdom”:
That a number of U.K. Government
departments were not certain that the
C.S.I.R. could be entrusted with certain
information, and that feeling militated, in
turn, against the U.K. as regards obtaining
information from the U.S.A.
Mr. Dedman, according to this story,
added:—
Neither he nor the Prime Minister felt
there was any justification for the U.K.
feeling, but the point was it existed.
And all the sound and fury and the
setting of the Canberra “Security police”
on to Mr. Fadden followed because he
exposed, in the interests of security, the
falsity of Mr. Dedman’s earlier and
emphatic denials—denials which, on the
face of it, Mr. Dedman should have
known to be unjustified at the time.
A Note From the P.M.G.
The hearts of “Labor” members bleed
for the old-age pensioner ; of that we are
intended to be left in no doubt. However
much they may differ on other little
matters, when it comes to concern for the
aged they are in complete accord, from
the Prime Minister down to Eden-
Monaro’s Mr. Fraser, who feels it a pity
that “some aged people, because of mis-
taken pride, refuse to apply for a
pension.” Pensioners have no sturdier
advocate than Senator Cameron, who but
for the means test would himself have
qualified for the pension five years ago—
unless he happened to be a victim of
“mistaken pride.” As Cameron has often
told the Senate his feelings on the subject
of pensions it is therefore in order to
examine how they work out in practice—
for instance, in the case of superannua-
tion payments to ex-employees of the
Postmaster-General’s Department, which
he has administered since 1945.
Last week the P.M.G.’s pensioners re-
ceived their fortnightly cheques a day
earlier than usual, and with them came
a printed slip, which read:
Commencing on Thursday, October 14,
1948, pensions will be paid on alternate
Thursdays instead of alternate Fridays, that
is, one day earlier. The enclosed cheque
is therefore in respect of 13 days’ pension.
Future cheques will be for the full fort-
nightly amount. '
Each cheque was thus at least several
shillings smaller. The reason for
the alteration is doubtless connected
with the convenience of administra-
tion, but the P.M.G. will find it
hard to convince his ex-employees that
they haven’t been robbed of one day’s
pension. Certain it is they have been
docked a day, and they will go to their
graves without getting it back—unless
they choose to die on a Friday.
In theory Socialists have hearts to
bleed ; in practice their machine-minds
always operate.
"On the Voices."
It is now a little more than two years
since the broadcasting of the Federal
Parliamentary debates began, and it
mightn’t be a bad idea if some sort of
public survey were made of listeners to
it to find out (a) whether it has revived
or increased interest in national politics,
and ( b ) just what the listeners think of
their legislators, having heard them at
their best and worst.
Before the debates were broadcast
most Australians, whose first acquaintance
with political speeches was in their
schooldays—when they read moving
passages from Burke and Pitt and
Disraeli or learned of their own “silver-
tongued orator,” Alfred Deakin —had to
depend on newspapers for current poli-
tical speeches. These, of course, were
edited so that grammar and diction
seemed reasonably good, and the printed
word could convey neither the sincerity
nor the hypocrisy of the spoken one.
Many, tuning-in to the Parliamentary
broadcasts, were astounded and fre-
quently disgusted. The average debate
sounded more like a row at the annual
meeting of a suburban football club.
One bad result of this is that many
people have stopped listening to them,
preferring to turn the dial to other
stations. Some have taken to complain-
ing in the press that Parliament on the
air is a waste of broadcasting time that
could better be devoted to music or
something else. Of those who still listen,
far too many do so in the hope of hear-
ing a sort of wordy brawl, and eagerly
tune-in to hear their particular fancy “do
over” somebody on the opposite side.
Nothing like the original number of
people now listen to Parliament, and
this again is a bad thing, since it proves
that the elected members haven’t the
power to hold their radio audiences, and
suggests that few Australians are interested
in politics (as they are) between elections.
It took the Bank Grab Act to attract a
radio audience, a startled nation “lending
its ears” as never before. Yet had a fair
proportion of electors listened to Parlia-
ment all along the country would have
been prepared for these sudden Socialist
shocks.
By this time next year, when the 1949
Federal election —for many new seats
as well as the old ones —may be over, the
Canberra broadcasts will have run
the full course of a Parliament. There
will then be an opportunity to assess
whether or not the electors have profited
from the chief revelation of the radio—
that the Commonwealth Parliament is
sadly in need of a cleaning-out of the
no-hopers and the infusion of new and
intelligent and patriotic blood.
The Double-crossers.
When in the political committee of
U.N.O. General Assembly the other day
Vyshinsky “screamed” at the British and
American delegations in a tirade of abuse
and vilification, he said incidentally:
“The Western Allies tried to get Hitler
to attack Russia in 1939. I will prove
the charge if you force me to lay all my
cards on the table.”
But these accusations can be refuted
today with the help of German State
papers produced at the Nuremberg trial,
and Winston Churchill’s first volume on
The Second World War (Cassell), dealing
with the interval between the two wars
and “The Gathering Storm” which burst
when Hitler attacked Poland, produces
some first-hand evidence. The world can
begin to appreciate at last why no Wes-
tern pact with Russia was possible
against Hitler. “The Nazis,” writes
Churchill, “differed from the Bolsheviks,
whom they denounced, no more than the
North Pole differs from the South,”
As for “the Allies trying to get Hitler
to attack Russia,” this is Churchill’s story
of an interview with Ribbentrop (then
German Ambassador) in London in
1937;
He asked me to come and see him and
have a talk The gist of his statement
was that Germany sought the friendship of
England an Anglo-German entente, or
even alliance. Germany would stand guard
for the British Empire in all its greatness
and extent What was required was that
Britain should give Germany a free hand in
the east of Europe. She must have lebens-
raum. Poland must be absorbed. White.
Russia and the Ukraine were indispensable
to the future life of the German Reich. All
that was asked of the British Common-
wealth and Empire Was not to interfere....
I said at once I was sure the British
Government [of which Churchill then was
not a member] would not agree to give
Germany a free hand in eastern Europe
although we hated Communism as much as
Hitler did.. . .Ribbentrop turned abruptly
away and said; “In that case war is in-
evitable. The Fiihrer is resolved. Nothing
will stop us.”
As Benes told Churchill in 1936, Hitler
offered to respect Czech integrity “in all
circumstances” if Benes would “forget”
his treaty with France while Hitler
attacked in the West.
There was, on April 16, 1939, an offer
to Britain from the Soviet, “the text of
which was not published,” for the crea-
tion of a united front of mutual assist-
ance between Britain, France and
U.S.S.R. But it came from Litvinov,
then Russian Foreign Commissar, who
within a fortnight was “bundled off the
stage to obscurity, a pittance and police
supervision”; and Litvinov proposed,
and the delayed British reply required as
a condition, the joint guarantee of the
small States in central Europe—the
obstacle to agreement was the terror of
these States at the prospect of receiving
Soviet help in the shape of Soviet armies.
Vyshinsky and Molotov shot up in
those years 1937-39. Vyshinsky was the
prosecutor in the merciless Soviet
purges of the earlier year. The purges
followed a disclosure to Stalin by Benes
of a plot with threads running through
the Soviet Embassy in Prague, between
the German Government and “Old
Guard” Communists in Moscow in
a conspiracy to overthrow Stalin and
establish a pro-German Soviet regime.
This service did not save Benes or his
country from the Moscow conspiracy to
destroy them this year.
And Molotov? As soon as Litvinov
went and Molotov took his place, pro-
Germanism in Moscow, previously
“heresy and treason” (as witness the
purges), became “overnight the policy of
the [Soviet] State, and woe was mechani-
cally meted out to anyone not quick
enough on the turnabout. For the task in
hand no one was better fitted or equipped
than the new Foreign Commissar”;
Vyacheslav Molotov was of outstanding
ability and cold-blooded ruthlessness.., .He
had lived and thrived in a society where
ever-varying intrigue was accompanied by
the constant menace of personal liquidation.
His cannon-ball head, black moustache and
comprehending eyes, his slab face, his
verbal adroitness and imperturbable de-
meanor were appropriate manifestations of
his qualities and skill.
He was above all men fitted to be the
agent and instrument of the policy of an
incalculable machine I have never seen
a human being who more perfectly repre-
sented the modern conception of a
robot [As a diplomatist] there was poise,
impenetrable purpose, and bland, official
correctitude. Never a chink opened. Never
a needless jar was made. His smile of
Siberian winter, his carefully-measured
and often wise words made him the perfect
agent of Soviet policy in a deadly world.
Correspondence with him upon disputed
matters was always useless, and, if pushed
far, ended in lies and insults Havoc and
ruin had been around all his days, either
impending on himself or dealt by him to
others.,..
From the moment when Molotov became
Foreign Commissar he pursued the policy
of an arrangement with Germany at the
expense of Poland.
Yet Soviet diplomatic representatives
abroad were instructed to inform Gov-
ernments to which they were accredited
that this change meant no alteration in
Russian foreign policy!

CRAVENA
CARRERAS LIMITED OVER 150 YEARS REPUTATION FOR QUALITY
POLITICAL POINTS
Until the week-end there appeared to
be three parties to the Kemeira tunnel
dispute, which had already, at the behest
of the Miners’ Federation, closed down
all the N.S.W. South Coast collieries
and threatened to spread to Northern and
Western fields. They were the Miners’
Federation, the A.W.U. and the contrac-
tors for the tunnel. On Saturday the
Coal Board intervened. It said nothing
to the Miners’ Federation, which had
pulled its men out of the mines, but it
ordered all mineowners to have their pits
ready for a Monday-morning start and
instructed the Australian Iron and Steel
Co. to cease work on the tunnel. A.I.
and S. refused to pass the order on to
its contractors and said:
It is time the appropriate authorities,
clothed with the necessary powers, took
effective steps to ensure that the Miners’
Federation complies with the laws of the
country and the awards of the industry.
The “appropriate authority” is the Coal
Board, and the Commonwealth and N. S.
Wales “Labor” Governments in creating
it clothed it “with the necessary powers/’
but on the rare occasions on which it
has attempted to use these powers to
curb the arrogant Miners’ Federation its
creators have overruled it. The Board
now seems to take the line of least re-
sistance. The hollow sound that echoed
in its ears on Sunday was probably
“Fixer” Ashley croaking “You took the
words out of my mouth.”
“Silly,” was Menzies’s verdict on the
Manila-girls dust-up, and it sums up the
feelings of most Australians on the sub-
ject. Vanity and a rush of power to the
head probably account for Calwell’s pig-
headedness in the matter; Chifley’s ap-
proval seems to be another instance of
the P.M.’s mistaken sense of loyalty to
his Ministers which impels him to sup-
port any decision they make, however fat-
headed. And, of course, “th’ pairty”
sticks together on the old Push prin-
ciple of hit one, hit the mob.
When Mr. Chifley told Parliament
recently that he and his colleagues could
not forget that they had come from poor
homes, a cynic remarked that some of
them had come a darned long way. John
Heffernan, ex-Mayor of Randwick, seems
to be of the same opinion. In resigning
from the A.L.P. he said that too many
State and Federal “Labor” members had
extensive private business activities out-
side their Parliamentary jobs. At one
time Heffernan was campaign secretary
for Falstein, M.H.R., and he has been
campaign director for W. M, Gollan,
M.L.A. for Randwick since 1941. Who's
Who in Australia says of Gollan: “Meat-
industry interests for many years; re-
tired 1939 ; Chrmn. of Drs. N.S.W. Bd.
Equitable Probate and Gen, Ins. Co,,
Ltd.; Dir. Five Ways Theatres, Ltd.”
On Sunday Methodist minister Church-
ward, new chairman of the Australian-
Russian Society, told his flock—doubtless
augmented by a few new sheep with
strange earmarks —that
the consistent aim of the Soviet Union was
the benefit and betterment of roan, without
discrimination,
and that
the purpose of Communism was to build
up a better civilisation which \yould ulti-
mately become a world-wide cortununity of
co-operation.
To support his beliefs he quoted from the
Articles of the Soviet Union and the
writings of the Dean of Canterbury.
Asses are still asses whether they bray in
a barnyard or a pulpit.
There is a tip for the Immigration
Minister in a report that one of his new
Australians, afflicted with the surname
Hitler, intends to change it. The Minister
proposes to make the naturalisation cere-
mony something more than a mere sign-
ing of papers so that the new citizen will
feel that Australian citizenship is a thing
to be valued. Why not consider Angli-
cising European Surnames? Shakspeare
notwithstanding, there is a mighty lot in
a name. Katzenjammer may be a patro-
nymic highly esteemed in Central Europe,
but any member of the family taking up
residence in Australia would do his
youngsters a service by changing it to
Catts or Coates, or even Calwell.
One of the Sunday-paper boys has dis-
covered a “revolt” in Federal Caucus,
the leaders of the insurrection being Wes-
tralians Beazley and Burke, If, as
alleged, the two young “Labor” men
did protest against suppressive clauses in
the new Broadcasting Bill, more power
to their elbow; but the real measure of
their enthusiasm in the public interest
will be the way they vote when the bill
comes before the House. It’s a trip
abroad at taxpayers’ expense to a handful
of Swan River prawns they’ll follow the
party line, suppressive clauses and all.
After November 1, when another rise
in the lead bonus is due, virtually every-
body working for the Mt. Isa (Q.) mining
company will receive over £l6 a week.
The result is a desertion of shop-hands,
clerks and council workers to the mine.
Some shopkeepers manage to retain staff
by paying well over award wages, but
the council can’t do that, and may shortly
have to call upon citizens to remove their
own garbage and do their own sanitary
work. Thus does the world wag merrily
on towards the “golden age” where all
shall be equal and even the sanitary man
can be a king.
Asked why the Government didn’t
make the increased pension payments
retrospective to July I—they1—they are to begin
next month—“poor old Holloway” re-
plied that there wasn’t enough staff to
handle the back payments. The next
time the public service, some union or
members of Parliament get a rise Hollo-
way should try the same excuse for not
making it retrospective—if he’s game.
The N.S.W. Housing Commission is
likely to experience a rush of persons
flourishing revolvers, balancing billiard-
cues, wearing coats inside-out, playing
cornets and leading giraffes on a string.
One William Allis, desperate for a home
and believing “that publicity might get
him one,” shoved a pistol under a Hous-
ing Commission officer’s nose, got him-
self pinched and fined a tenner, and got
himself a home. Thousands would
willingly go through much more than
that for the same reward.
Suggestions that industrial strife in
the democracies is not only inspired by
Russia but often financed by it are
usually scoffed at by the Comrades’ fel-
low-travellers. Horner, Communist sec-
retary of the British miners, spilt the
beans when he told the French Con-
federation of Labor, speaking of the coal
strikes of 1921 and 1926:
It was thanks to the assistance received
from miners’ organisations in other countries
that we were able to hold out. It was
thanks above all to the help of Russia,
which sent us over £1 million sterling.
Homer also told French mineworkers
that the British miners were behind them
in their present Moscow-directed strike.
His president. Will Lawther, promptly
repudiated the statement.
Melbourne “Age” described women
who demonstrated in the Metropolitan
Gas Company’s building as “members of
the New Housewives’ Association, a
breakaway movement from the House-
wives’ Association.” Actually the “New
Housewives” are a batch of female Com-
rades whose chief functions are “demon-
strating” and distributing Communist
propaganda.
Victoria’s acting Police Commissioner,
asked to report on the increase in the
number of drunken brawls on Saturday
afternoons, found a prime cause to be
the 40-hour week. Through it many
hotels closed for the afternoon, those that
stayed open became overcrowded, and
jostling led to squabbles. Communist-
controlled unions are now agitating for
a 35-hour week, and the ultimate objec-
tive of the “Labor” movement in N. S,
Wales is a 30-hour week. The emphasis
all the time is on more leisure. To the
proper employment of leisure not a
moment’s thought is given.
It’s come at last —an admission by a
“Labor” man that his thinking is 30
years behind the times. Calwell in the
course of one of his vituperative speeches
slashed out at W. M. Hughes; “It just
so happens that the right honorable
member for North Sydney speaks his
present mind and I speak the mind he
used to speak when he belonged to the
Labor party.” It was after he left the
“Labor” party that Billy stood up to
President Wilson and others at Versailles
and successfully claimed the New Guinea
mandate for Australia. Calwell has at
least made a start to emulate the Little
Digger; he’s claiming 23 girls.
Queensland Trades and Labor Council
is asking the Federal Government (1) to
quash the conviction of Communist Burns
(sentenced to six months’ jail on a charge
of sedition), (2) to repeal the political and
industrial sections of the Crimes Act, (3)
to instruct its representatives at U.N.O.
“to give full support to the Soviet Union’s
proposals to ensure peace,” (4) to pro-
claim an Australian Socialist Soviet Re-
public. Wait, an error there —the fourth
item isn’t on the list of requests, but it
will doubtless be added in due course.
Thornton’s Red Racket, the Iron-
workers’ Association, got a setback .last
week when the Arbitration Court declared
invalid its provision for a compulsory
political levy. Strictly speaking, the levy
wasn’t compulsory, but to avoid it a mem •
ber was required to sign a “contract-bul”
form which might have made him a
marked man.
Seeking by advertisement contributions
for its election funds, the A.L.P. pub-
lishes the lines: “The average real income
per head has risen by 14 p.c. since
1938-39. —National Bank of Australasia
statement.” But what wasn’t advertised
was the rest of the bank’s statement, to
the effect that great numbers now find
their income insufficient to buy goods
and services that 10 years ago were
plentiful and inexpensive, and that part
of the cause is taxation, part the
changes in distribution of incomes, part
the variation in quality and composition
of goods and services that make up real
income. Asked about the advertisement,
Mr. Chifley said he and Dr. Evatt had
approved of it, but he would have the
quotation “examined,” Nobody need
hope that he means to examine—and
profit by—the whole statement.
Death removed Victoria’s only woman
M.L.A. last week. She was Mrs. Fanny
Brownbili, who’d held the Geelong seat
for “Labor” for 10 years. The seat was
held by her husband from 1919 to 1938,
and when he died she succeeded him.
A quiet and kindly woman, she thought
more of aiding charities than party
politics.
N.S.W, tram and bus services threaten
to go a further £1,200,000 to the bad by
June 30 next. Cabinet’s dilemma is to
find a way out of the mire without in-
creasing fares and without cutting down
the list of deadheads —which is almost as
long as the trip to La Perouse. With
Chifley holding the purse-strings the
problem seems insoluble, unless the Mc-
Girrs amalgamate the department with
the State Lottery outfit and run sweeps
on tram-ticket numbers.
Upon the sugar industry more than any
other factor depends the prosperity of
Northern Queensland. It is a well-run
industry, and efficiency is the keynote of
the growing, crushing and refining pro-
cesses. The weak link is between mill and
refinery, and its name is the Waterside
Workers’ Federation. Figures quoted re-
cently for a typical mill in Mackay tell
their own story. Storage capacity 11,700
tons, present stock 6120; weekly output
1500, deliveries to wharf 800. Refusal
of the watersiders to work beyond certain
hours means that the sugar is piling up at
the rate of 700 tons a week. It’s the same
story at other mills.
Commonwealth Conciliation Commis-
sioners have to be patient men, willing to
turn the other cheek. Militant trade-
union secretaries show as little respect for
their rulings as they do for the verdicts of
Arbitration Court Judges. Painters and
Dockers’ Union men have been on strike
for nearly three weeks because they dis-
approve of a ruling by Commissioner
Galvin. Last Wednesday at a compulsory
conference the union’s secretary, Gordon,
told Commissioner Dwyer his crowd
“had become disgusted with the Arbitra-
tion Court and would just as soon be out
of it tomorrow.” To a suggestion that a
resumption of work might be ordered, he
replied; “Even if we are ordered we won’t
go back.” That’s typical of the sweet
reasonableness militants bring to the con-
ciliation chamber.
Whoever arranged the Parliamentary
broadcast last Thursday night earned
a vote of thanks from commercial
radio stations. Had the “secret-docu-
ments” debate been broadcast half Aus-
tralia would have tuned in; the radio
audience for the dreary Senate debate was
probably limited to wives and families of
the Senators.
But why wasn’t the documents debate
broadcast? The Prime Minister had al-
ready shown that he regarded the matter
as of vital national importance; this
was his justification for sooling the
Security police on to Fadden.
In other days men joined the Army
to leam to defend their country; under
the Chambers scheme the inducements
held out by advertisements are to “learn
a trade,” enjoy “exciting spare-time re-
creation with plenty of outdoor life,”
or to “follow up your favorite hobby.”
A quarter-page advertisement based on
the hobby motif depicts a young man
tinkering with a wireless-set and saying:
I’m getting scientific training for my
hobby. Wireless has always been my keen
interest and now I’ve joined the Citizen
Army I can get instruction from real radio
experts. It certainly suits me. I get paid
to learn.
It seems a strange way to raise a fighting
force to carry on the traditions of the
First and Second A.I.F. In the display
part of the advertisement “Citizen” is in
bold type, “Army” ghosted. Most ap-
propriate—the Chambers Force is a
shadow army.
Churchill has lost nothing of his word-
power. He told the Conservative party
conference at Llandudno:
The United Nations have been reduced
to a mere cockpit in which mighty nations
and ancient States hurl reproaches, taunts,
and insults at one another to marshal
public opinion and inflame the passions of
their peoples in order to arouse and pre-
pare them for what seems to be the re-
morselessly-approaching Third World War.
Then came the typical Churchillian
summing-up:
The fourteen men in the Kremlin who
rule nearly 300,000,000 human beings with
an arbitrary authority never possessed by
any Tsar since Ivan the Terrible, and who
are now holding down nearly half of
Europe by Communist methods, dread the
friendship of a free, civilised world as
much as they would its hostility.
The late Wendell Willkie’s “One
World” envisioned under the illusion of
Russian pretences, Mr. Henry Wallace’s
“One World” based on Moscow’s flatter
ing of his personal ambitions or anti-
pathies, Dr. Evatt’s “One World” based
on heaven knows what save Bert for Bert,
are all voices crying down the wind of
rising world unrest. It is necessary as
never before that Australian opinion shall
crystallise about something more trust-
worthy than Dr. Evatt’s optimism or
barrow-pushing.
In Queensland the Q.P.P. and the
Country party have been discussing plans
for the Federal election, the aim being
to avoid three-cornered contests. Pro-
gress reports speak of agreement on all
seats except a few which are the subject
of boundary protests to the Redistribution
Commission.


THE NEW WARFARE.
“The British Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Food, Dr. Edith Summershill, said that If women had the handling of affairs all
weapons would be prohibited except the tongue.”

“Becks”: I have never thought of
Federal “Hansard” as a book to go to
in order to increase one’s vocabulary,
except perhaps in the realnr. of depart-
mental polysyllables, but a passage in a
recent issue has changed my opinion.
Repatriation Minister Barnard was
speaking when Mr. White fired a
question at him. Quoth the Minister,
“The Honorable Member for Bala-
clava (Mr. White) is a confirmed
yattler. He yaffles and yaffles and
yaffles.” Mr. Gullett interjected, “What
does the Minister mean by ‘yaffle’?”
That’s where “Hansard” let me down.
Like Mr. Gullett —and probably Mr.
White and every other member of the
House—l would like to know just what a
yattler is and what he does when he
yaffles. But Mr. Sheehan, who was act-
ing as Chairman of Committees, appar-
ently did not share our curiosity. Or
perhaps he already knew. Anyway, he
shouted “Order! Members of the Oppo-
sition are too noisy.” I hope the House
won’t leave it at that. If a Minister can
call a member a yattler and get away
with it he can call him anything. Of
course, if a member yattles I suppose
he’s a yattler ; but what is he doing when
he yattles?

“Castlereagh”: “Macnell’s” remark —
“Tennyson’s ballad on Grenville’s Re-
venge could in some ways be Yarra’s
epitaph” (B. 22/9/’4B) —seems to imply
that the Elizabethan ship fought the
greater fight. She didn’t. Yarra, a little
sloop with but three 4in. guns, faced three
heavy cruisers mounting over a score of
Sin. guns and attendant destroyers.
Tennyson’s ballad conveys a misleading
impression of the actual odds against the
"Hold on a tick , Sam — they've got some corker undies here."
Revenge. Only 20 of the 53 Spaniards
were warships. Revenge, a crack ship
of the English Navy, was very power-
fully gunned for her size—she carried 22
heavy cannon—3o- and 24-pounders—
and 24 lighter pieces. The Spanish ships
mounted fewer and lighter cannon than
did English ones, and in gunnery the
Spaniards were decidedly inferior—the
English fire was three times as fast. The
Spaniards placed their main reliance on
boarding—each galleon had its detach-
ment of infantry—and for that reason
the ships were very high-built. The Eng-
lish vessels were built much lower —an ad-
vantage from a gunner’s point of view.
That Grenville destroyed four ships in-
dicates the volume and accuracy of his
gunfire. No more than three or four
ships could engage him at once. The
great advantage the Spaniards’ numbers
gave them was that they were gradually
able to wear Revenge down. When her
ammunition was exhausted Revenge had
to surrender; she was the only English
ship of the line that struck in Elizabeth’s
long contest with Spain. There appears to
have been no necessity for Grenville to
have fought. Historians generally pro-
nounce him guilty of risking his men’s
lives out of bravado. The motives that
inspired Yarra’s captain were very dif-
ferent. He faced desperate odds in the
hope that the convoy he was escorting
might be helped to escape.

“Clooter”: Upon the falling into my
irreverent hands of the “Anti-Slavery
Reporter and Aborigines’ Friend” for
July, 1948,1 discovered, on the authority
of a certain R. H. A. Merlen, that “The
seven years which have elapsed since the
liberation of Ethiopia have witnessed
gigantic changes in every sphere of world
affairs, and, above all, in the pattern of
colonial relationships.” This, it seems,
makes Selassie’s kingdom “no longer a
backward country secure within the
folds of the Empire.” Intrigued by the
emergence of what might be termed a
new color problem, I read on. Strike me
pink, would you believe that “In the
early days Japan, her development and
her stand against imperialism, had
exerted a profound influence over the
Ethiopian intelligentsia”? Fascinated by
this Japanese stand against imperialism,
I could hardly wait to learn that a small
handbook “published in Moscow”
showed how the “Western monopolists”
had destroyed the Ethiops’ cotton and
iron industries. However, all is not yet
—er —black for the future. Mr, Merlen
is satisfied that when a United Somalia
is created all those Somalis who have left
for other parts will, “of course, flock
back to the mother country.” I hate to
disillusion the man, but has he ever
studied the history of Liberia?

“Pongo”; Those responsible for the
mutilation of Sydney Botanic Gardens
gate-posts probably took their bad ex-
ample from an earlier generation of
Bumbles who flourished at the time the
present King’s father came out to open
the first Commonwealth Parliament.
Before the Royal visit a gang of scrubbers
and rubbers was sooled on to the statues
of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, In
one day those statues presented a brand-
new appearance, and gone for a genera-
tion was that beautiful weathering that
had been becoming richer with the years.
The scrubbers even had a rub at the
metal-covered towers of the Lands De-
partment and the G.P.0., which glistened
in the sun for months afterwards.

“V. Cluse”; In addition to being a
“connoisseur of gate-posts” (B. 6/10/’4B)
it is possible that his Majesty, since he
spends so much of his life in a city where
such things are revered, has an eye for
old iron. “Good iron” isn’t heard much
nowadays, but time was when it was an
Australian expression indicative of satis-
faction and, as such, more pleasing to
the ear than the modem “good-oh,” and
I dare swear that it arrived here with our
British forebears. On the quality of the
iron depended the strength and virtue of
stirrups, bridle-bits, plough-beams and
bedsteads, and on the quality of the iron
in both his guns and their shot did Nelson
depend for the victories of the Nile and
Trafalgar. These many years there has
stood on its four-wheeled carriage in
Sydney’s Hyde Park, its “adamantine
lips” covering the entrance to the Domain,
a giant specimen of the old cannon whose
voices thundered the rise of Britain under
Victoria. Time and weather had

mellowed its contours to a beautiful glow-
ing iron-brown, signifying both its age
and honors. But away with taste and
tradition! For three weeks recently it
wore a new coat of battleship grey, pre-
sumably in the belief that this was the
correct color in which an old gun might
hope to catch the royal glance of a sailor
King. But better counsels evidently pre-
vailed. Now it wears a delicate green,
obviously a tribute to the prevailing hue
of the nation’s cricket and football colors
and perhaps an attempt to prevent the
old monster from being too stark and
thus attracting more of the Royal atten-
tion than the City Council’s new
mechanical street-sweeper.

“O’Yen”: To what lengths employers
are prepared to go to attract female labor
these days! An ad. in our local paper:
“Opportunity, young lady, knowledge
book-keeping, typing. Amenities: morn-
ing, afternoon tea, time off hair-sets.” If
that doesn’t snare ’em nothing will.

“Muskeen: Some of those cafe
artists (B. 8/9/’4B) were not too bad.
I have drawings of myself done in 1916
and 1940 in a Soho cafe and a beer-
joint at the bottom of Alienby-road in
Tel Aviv respectively, and I consider the
latter to be the better of the two. I
couldn’t find this sketch after I had
paid for it, and accused the artist.
He leapt through a window with
me after him, and we sprinted up
Allenby-road to the astonishment of the
citizens, but he evaded me. Back in camp
that night I found the drawing. I had
rolled it up and placed it inside my shirt
for safe-keeping.

“Hamfat”; The lengthy stage careers
of several Thespians have been men-
tioned recently ; but not one of them can
approach that of Stanley Hope. I was
Stanley Hope myself 40-odd years ago,
that being the name thrown into the
programme against a minor part I
doubled with my main role; about the
same time there were three other Stanley
Hopes on the bills of other shows; and
recently I saw it on the programme of
a modern show in which the length of
the cast of characters meant that some
of the small parts had to be “doubled.”
Betterton, one of the pillars of the
Restoration stage, was reported to have
had a feud with “a minor-part actor
named Stanley Hope”; he may have
been the only real S. Hope, but the
name has lived as a theatrical myth ever
since.

“B. A, Ker”: An insidious thing about
cigarette-packet collections (B. 6/10/’4B)
is the way the youngsters can swear in
uncles and aunts as swappers, scroungers,
scavengers and procurers in general. The
carton that looked up at me from the
centre of the floor in the restaurant
seemed a rare ’un; but a grown and
balding man couldn’t make an idiot of
himself by picking the thing up. Still,
my conscience would not be dismissed
as easily as that. The thing might be
a Rembrandt among cigarette-packets ; it
might make young Robert the envy of
the school. I contrived to knock my
hat on the floor and, stooping to re-
trieve it, scooped up the treasure. Before
I had regained my chair a female voice
asked incredulously: “Did you pick up
that cigarette-packet?” Fires flared in my
ears as I stammered: “Well, yes, you see,
my young nephew he—er-—saves them.”
The waitress looked at me fixedly. “So
does mine,” she said. “And I was go-
ing to pick that up as soon as I could
put my tray down.” I handed it over.
Robert can do his own scrounging in
future.
“Horseless Horseman”: Another thing
the Imlays will be remembered for (B.
29/9/’4B) is that of starting one of the
first industries in Gippsland. Dr. George
Imlay and his brother Peter established
a whaling station at Gabo early in 1840
with an old Greenland whaler, Captain
John Stevenson, as superintendent. They
went there after trying Jervis Bay and
Twofold Bay. The present stone shed at
the end of the jetty at Santa Barbara
Cove on Gabo, and now used by the
Lighthouse Department, was built by
the Imlays; it was from Stevenson that
Captain’s Point, at Mallacoota Inlet, got
its' name.

“Holy Boy”: Tell “Zake” (B.
15/9/’4B) “plonk” was a term used by
old Indian Army men to describe any
who had served long periods under the
Indian sun; it is a corruption of the
Hindustani for madness, puggled or
plunk. Long before the Aussies arrived
it was used in France when speaking of
vin blanc, or gone plonk, as the effects
of a night on that beverage was com-
parable to the old sweat who had the
Indian-summer brand on him.

“G. Iris”: The office-cleaner at the
Barracks —an old RA.A. man —came up
to me and said “I want you to do a sum
for me.” I told him to go ahead. He
did so. “Put this down: Eight multiplied
by 365 less 52 and 12. Call it pounds
and tell me how many tons you get.”
, I told him roughly one. “Well,” he said.
“I’ve been lifting that blasted gadget
for nearly 20 years ; that’s 20 tons; and
I’m not going to lift it any more!” The
gadget was an obsolete manuscript-
holder once used by the typists; it had
rested for years, unused, on an office
desk and he had daily lifted it up to
dust around it. He picked it up for
the last time and flung it through the
window on to the parade-ground,

“Derwent”: Launceston builders have
just been casting their eye over an old
house built by John Pascoe Fawkner
about 1818. With foundations of large
chunks of stone cemented together to
the thickness of almost 2ft., sunk more
than 4ft, into the ground, it has brick
walls 13in. through, and contains enough
bricks to build four present-day dwellings.
A good many of the bricks show con-
vict thumb-marks. There’s hardly a
sign of a crack, and the heavy roof-
timbers are just as sound as when they
were put in. The tall, decorated gables
and old-fashioned shuttered windows,
with decorated doorway, make it a pic-
turesque building ; it was probably Laun-
ceston’s first two-storied house, although
Fawkner also built the Cornwall Hotel,
from which the Melbourne expedition set
out.

“T.McN.”; The Bulletin’s little
sister, The Australian Woman’s
Mirror, must have given some thought
to the sentence that opened an article on
the subject: “De-facto wives (that is,
unwed cohabitants)” ; but what’s wrong
with the simple old term, mistress? The
press should be wary of coining new
phrases—they are too readily grabbed by
a civil service which delights in jargon.
Any time now I expect to hear of a re-
habilitated ex-unwed cohabitant.
BLANKY.
“A Maoriland magistrate, dismissing a charge of
abusive language against a taxi-driver who had told
his fare he had ‘bloody good cause to be angry,’
pointed out that the word complained of, when used
to emphasise a statement, was not necessarily in-
decent or offensive.”
You couldn’t think of better ways,
I venture, for portraying it
Than in that often-quoted phrase:
“It isn’t so much what he says,
It’s just his way of saying it.”
The word in print looks rude and coarse,
But it’s another story
When requisitioned to enforce
Some point you’re anxious to endorse.
The synonym for “gory.”
It may be held, one must admit,
Abusive and offensive.
The sort of term to heat and hit
A quarrel up, but not when it
Is patently intensive,
Something an extra kick to give
To what’s traditionally
Viewed as a mere superlative
To that Australian adjective
We’ve softened down to “bally.”
Here’s to that estimable Beak
Who offers, should you seek it.
Guidance for when, in sudden pique,
You may decide the word to speak—
The point is how you speak it.
Whether you’re feeling wild and wet
Or merely mildly cranky,
The way it’s uttered (don’t forget)
Distinguishes the epithet
Synonymous with “blanky.”

Since ike dawn of history, men have striven to master
time. And the Swiss Watchmaking Industry has won
fame because it has made this vision a reality. Among
those who have contributed to the progress of watch-
craft, the Societe Anonyme Louis Brandt & Frere of
Bienne (Switzerland)'—Omega Watch Co.—can say
to-day that for one hundred years their activity has
been devoted to the manufacture of high precision
movements.

Omega watches at the Geneva Observatory and the

A CENTURY OF PRECISION
In 1848 Louis Brandt founded the watch
factory later styled Societe Anonyme
Louis Brandt & Frere of Bienne (Swit-
zerland). By creating the OMEGA, this
century-old firm has given the world a
timekeeper constantly perfected.
International Contests of the British National Observa-
tory serve as the fundaments of further scientific
progress. For 13 years, OMEGA has held the record
for precision at the British National Observatory.
The famous 50mm, Chronometer is the only model of
its kind in the world to hold simultaneously the highest
awards granted by the Geneva and British National
Observatories in rating tests.

one century of experience and watchcraft ... at
your service.

“Laetitia”: Extreme sociability was the
keynote of the behavior of the drunk
among the crowd milling around the city
delicatessen counter. Only from the in-
cognito duchess dishing out the pressed-
beef and porks did his affability produce
a resentful response. Suddenly the beery
one’s bonhomie disappeared as, with a
shrill yell, “She tried to gut me!” he
catapulted astern, upsetting the queue
behind him like a row of dominoes. The
duchess hysterically protested her inno-
cence. Calm was restored with the arrival
of the manager, who, to satisfy the bibul-
ous one, reconstructed the tableau and
showed that the duchess’s determined
knife-thrust at a tray of brawn reposing
against the side of the glass show-case
nearest to the drunk had been interpreted
by him as aimed at his vitals.

“C. Sandy”: “The Verger’s” par. (B.
6/10/’4B) regarding the parish magazine
and The Bulletin joke-block recalls the
appearance of a Bulletin text in an
Edinburgh church paper over 30 years
ago. The text “When a man talks
religion to you, brand your calves” was
followed by the Calvinistic comment of
the magazine’s Religious Editor: “Thus,
it can be seen at what low a level are the
morals of the people of Australia.”
* * * *
“Salt Junk Joe”: “What do I call the
winds that blow in the Roaring Forties?”
(B. 13/10/’4B). Well, I’ve heard my
shipmates call ’em all sorts of names,
but if “The Showman” wants a monicker
to use for his next Flower-show report,
he can’t do better than “the stormy
westerlies,” or, more poetically, “The
Brave West Winds.” In attempting to
justify his misconception on this matter
he has dragged in several authorities—all
academic blokes; not a real sailor among
the lot. His school geography primer
can be dismissed for a start. At school
I was taught a wealth of “facts” about
the sea that had to be unlearned later,
and “The Showman” obviously suffered
similarly. The Commonwealth Year-
Book quotation does not name the winds,
so it proves nothing. As to A. P. Beck-
insale, M.A., what ships did he sail in?
Griffith Taylor is a man whose opinion
I can respect. An academic chap, but
one who has shown he can learn from
contact with practical men. He certainly
.wrote the passage quoted by “The Show-
man” ; it appears on page 50 of the first
edition of his Australia Physiographic
and Economic, but on page 41 of the
same book appears the comment: “At
latitude 40 S. (‘the roaring forties’), a
very constant wind blows from the west
and is known as the ‘Brave West Wind’.”
Perhaps “The Showman” didn’t notice
that passage; possibly he also missed a
footnote to the preface:
The final proofs have not been revised
by the author, who is on his way to the
Antarctic as a member of Captain Scott’s
expedition.
After Griffith Taylor’s return from An-
tarctica he issued a revised edition,
“largely rewritten,” from which he
omitted the passage quoted by “The
Showman”—though he retained the re-
ference on page 41. As I said, obviously
he is a man who is prepared to profit
from experience.

“Pitt St.”: A newly-arrived four-year-
old immigrant startled some reporters by
announcing that his name was Amyas
Ross, whereupon his proud dad an-
nounced that he believed his son to be
the only so-named person in the world,
and that he “found the name in an
ancient Scottish book.” He needn’t have
hunted so far back —Amyas Leigh is
the hero of Kingsley’s Westward Ho!,
read by practically every schoolboy who

at letter-writing
speaks English. And, since Kingsley’s men
were Devon men, Amyas is more likely a
Devon name.

“Ratline Ralph”: I don’t know why
the Scandinavians are so keen on motor-
vessels —they were among the first sea-
farers to adopt them, and probably
operate as. many as any other nation —
but I presume it had something to do
with their being sea-pioneers throughout
their history. Anyway, the oldest motor-
ship afloat, still in her original shape and
with her original engines, berthed in
Melbourne the other day. She’s the
Danish-owned Annam, of 6600 tons,
built in Copenhagen in 1913, Like all
the early motor-ships, she carries no
funnel or sails, and to see her moving up
the bay under four bare poles made most
observers look twice —the exhausts run
up the sides of a mast. Her diesels drive
her at 11.5 knots in good weather. She
was tied up at Rotterdam when Hitler
broke loose, escaped the Luftwaffe’s
levelling of Rotterdam and got to Copen-
hagen. There she lay with some old ships
throughout the occupation, ignored by
the Germans as an old tub upon which
a few superannuated watermen lived.
They didn’t know she was a hide-out for
the resistance groups and carried a store
of arms.

“Cauboy”: How many grand-opera
addicts know the vast extent of the ocean
out of which the Taits have dipped a
pailful? A standard encyclopaedia of
opera gives a list of 203 composers with
512 works worth a mention. Yet these
are only an infinitesimal fraction of the
number that have been written. Doni-
zetti alone wrote 70, and, as far as Aus-
tralia is concerned, “Lucia di Lammer-
moor” is the only survivor, though “La
Favorita” and “The Daughter of the
Regiment” have made an occasional
appearatice. Leoncavallo and Mascagni
between them must have written 100, but
all that survive in the popular repertoire
are “Pagliacci” and “Cavalleria Rusti-
cana,” both one-acters. Verdi wrote
more than 30, most of them highly suc-
cessful, but only three or four seem to
have reached export standard. Add the
mighty Wagnerian cycle, which Australia
never hears, Mozart, the great Russian
and French composers and a consider-
able quantity of English and you have a
world of music almost as large as that of
literature or painting. The Firm, how-
ever, presumably knows its onions, and
out of this immense field it picks a bare
17 or 18 winners.

“A.L.A.” (Fiji); I had always thought
The Bulletin’s Religious Editor a fic-
titious being, but now I am not quite so
sure. In Life Story of a Valiant Woman
I came across this: “The Sydney
Bulletin administered a mild rebuke to
the folk of the ‘Queen City’ (Wilcannia),
saying that, though they could boast of
the biggest race-meeting and had the
most up-to-date Athenaeum outside the
city, and held shows and squatters’ balls
in lavish fashion, there was only one
church in the town (the Anglican), and
hardly a man attended that.” The book
was published about 20 years ago.

“Mabsout”: I wonder what old Albert
thinks of the controversy over whether a
soldier should be allowed to write to the
Minister for the Army. In 1943 a large
draft of B-class men, was transferred
from A.I.F. units to an employment
company in a North Queensland port.
None of us liked it, but the only one to
act was Albert. He wrote a letter of pro-
test to Mr. Forde, Minister for the
Army, and to dodge red-tape posted it at
the town post-office. A reply signed by
Mr. Forde duly arrived —a polite
generalisation on Army policy towards
B-class men. Albert wasn’t satisfied. He
wrote again asking why A 1 office troops
down south and the strong young
bookies and sportsmen who had cushy
jobs in munition offices couldn’t do some
of the hard yacker for a change and let
men who’d done their share have a rest
Another polite but uninformative reply
had no effect on Albert. He continued
with his suggestions and turned to other
aspects of national affairs. From his
letters Mr. Forde must) have learnt a lot
about the ordinary working private’s
viewpoint. Before long Albert had quite
a sheaf of courteous letters from him.
Others, spurred by Albert’s success, also
thought of sending in a moan or two,
but were cautioned against it by wise-
heads, who pointed out that the Minister
was much more likely to listen to Albert
than to someone he didn’t know. So
Albert became unofficial liaison-officer
between our employment company and
the Minister. I think Albert was really
sorry when he was transferred south as
“Tentative D-class.”

“Ellae”: I can uphold “Hati Bran’s”
(B. 25/8/’4B) idea that the reason today’s
children can take oil easily is that they
know why it is given, since any question
showing a child’s natural curiosity about
its own engine-room is now answered
fully, not with a yelp of “Don’t be rude.”
Yesterday’s children —well, here’s my ex-
perience. Whenever my crime was “being
unbearably cranky” for acting as my
mother did when “nerve-racked,” she
would say “You want a dose of oil” in
the same tone as “You want a sound
thrashing” for any other crime. Naturally,
I lumped the two things together as ex-
amples of parental tyranny. Incredible
as it may seem to this generation, I was
almost grown-up when a doctor told me
in plain words the reason for oil-taking,

“Spokeshave”: Church magazines?
The Bishop of Salisbury (Eng.) published
in his some verses, one of which ran this
way:
I love the clean clinic, which washed me
with care;
And the Nursery-school lady who tooth-
combed my hair;
And all the Youth Movements, so toil-
worn for me;
But Mother, God bless her, she never sees
me*
This unexpectedly witty analysis on the
institutionalised child, much to the sur-
prise of the bishop, has raised the ire of
the publishers of the song “Mother
Machree”; they claim infringement of
copyright.

“T.P.”: “Hamfat” (B. 22/9/’4B), play-
ing a leading part in “The Octoroon,”
took me back 50 years to a Victorian
outback town where that play was pro-
duced in a barn. Our schoolteacher
played the Red Indian to the life, and
next day decided to don his war panoply
again for a demonstration to the nippers.
Inspector Henry Rix, a noted educationist
of the period, arrived at the school just
in time to hear a fearsome yell ending
in a terrific whoop. Then a 6ft. Mohawk
chief with dangling scalps and waving
a tomahawk burst into view. Rix sat
down backwards; a strangely-chastened
savage helped hint up and dusted him.
The inspector was a breezy man. with the
saving salt of humor. The school was
in excellent order. A bit of his official
report read, “ I heard only portion
of the geography lesson on N. America
dealing with the Red Indians. It was
most realistic, and was enjoyed by the
pupils,”

“Keekwun”: “Loc” can cease won-
dering why silver should be “treasure
trove” while notes are “lost property”
(B. 15/9/’4B), Under English law any
pieces of gold or silver dug from the
ground automatically become treasure
trove, and it is an offence to conceal
such a find. If unclaimed, they revert to
the Crown, but the finder, if he has
promptly handed over the stuff, is entitled
to the full value as compensation. In
1942 two men missed a fortune by keep-
ing quiet about a ploughed-up cache of
early-Roman silver. The man who found
it handed it without question to a col-
lector friend, who thought it was pewter.
The mistake was not discovered until
four years later, when the silver was
acquired by the -British Museum and
£lOOO was paid to each of the finders.
The full value was in the vicinity of a
quarter of a million.
HOMO SAPIENS.
Man rules the world, you must agree,
Since palaeolithic days were done;
The heir of all the ages, he,
Of animals the paragon,
Who rose to run this mundane show
From prediluvian caves and glens.
It sometimes makes me wonder, though,
How he obtained a suffix so
Debatable as sapiens.
It differentiates him from
The brute creation, you suggest,
With skill to make an atom-bomb
Or subjugate Mount Everest.
Of human knowledge all the sum,
Stored from a million tongues and pens
His heritage has long become,
A rich and rare residuum —
But does that make him sapiens?
“Wise, knowing, shrewd, judicious, well-
Advised,” my dictionary gives
This classical trisyllable
With several other adjectives.
But view the stricken world today,
Its desolated denizens,
And in the mass, as one might say,
How few could claim the sobriquet
That’s shadowed forth in sapiens!
Still, one discerns through history’s mists
He’d never stomach as a pal
The chap whom anthropologists
Refer to as Neanderthal.
He beat those rival ape-men by
His ampler stock in nous and mens.
Rooted them out relentlessly,
Which may supply the reason why
He’s known as Homo sapiens.

set to work clearing the woods and brush around what is

THE SERVICE MAN
PARACHUTE TROOPS.
“Ek Dum”: A phrase which
occurs ever more constantly to
the minds of those who contem-
plate the forlorn condition of
Australian defences —forlorn ex-
cept for the enthusiasm of de-
fence staffs which live in hope
for tomorrow —is “parachute
troops.”
If Australia has any plans for
dealing with those troops that
other countries are sure to have,
deep secrecy surrounds the
matter.
Yet there can be no doubt
about the part which airborne
and parachute troops will play
in any coming war if the enemy
has even a moderate strength in
aircraft and trained men.
The Germans used parachute
troops early in World War If.
Their use was largely responsible
for the devastating success of
their Netherlands and Nor-
wegian campaigns. They took
Crete with parachutists after
Allied appreciations said that it
never could be done. It is a
mystery, perhaps explained by a
shortage of aircraft, why they
did not make airborne attempts
on Malta and on the Suez Canal
at certain stages. With Malta, at
one juncture, they would cer-
tainly have had at least a
measure of success, even if they
had not fully succeeded.
British Lead
Despite the fact that it is in-
cessantly canvassed that the Rus-
sians were the pioneer para-
chutists, that honor actually be-
longed to. the British, as illus-
trated papers round 1924 will
testify. Yet the British were the
most backward in making use of
this form of approach until the
Germans had proved how suc-
cessful it could be. Then they
took the lead —if the Russians
who were supposed to have
myriads of parachute troops
ever dropped any during their
war with Germany they were
more modest about it than was
usually the case about their ex-
ploits.
The United States followed
Britain rapidly, and with superb

equipment and their usual
mechanical ability they soon
built up airborne divisions which
today are of staggering capacity
for movement and of a versa-
tility and carrying-power and
range which makes them for-
midable beyond experience with
any other formations in history.
To Britain’s parachute train-
ing school, however, belongs the
greatest credit for the war de-
velopments in airborne and air-
discharged troops. It/handled
about 60,000 British and Allied
parachutists during the war, de-
spite the fact that it was not
created until the, Germans had
given their demonstration at
Rotterdam in 1940.
War Service
Four years later two airborne
divisions were used to assure
success in the capture of the neck
of the Cotentin Peninsula in the
Normandy landing, and, despite
doleful predictions that the land-'
ing losses of men and aircraft
might be as high as 75 per cent,
to 80 per cent.. General Eisen-
hower was able to write after the
event:
Without the airborne divisions an
assault against the Varreville beaches
would have been most hazardous,
since our attack could only be on
a one-division front.... I ultimately
took upon myself the heavy respon-
sibility of deciding that the airborne
operation against Cotentin be carried
out. The decision, once taken, was
loyally and efficiently executed by the
airborne forces, and it is to them
that immeasurable credit for the sub-
sequent success of the western
operation belongs. The airborne
landing losses proved only a fractior
of what had been feared, amounting,
in fact, to less than 10 per cent.
Even before that, both para-
chute and glider had established
themselves as methods of attack
to be thought of among the first
expedients of surprise and dis-
ruption. And there were no real
failures —not in Sicily, at
Arnhem, or in Burma in large-
scale war ; nor in the small raids
which began to be made as early
as 1941 on enemy facilities —the
daring pounce on the Apulia
viaduct in Southern Italy in
February, 1941, the raid on
Bruneval a few months after-
wards, the numerous North

African snatches of 1942-43, all
preliminaries to the vast Burma
air campaign and the operations
of the Rhine advance in 1944
and 1945. These finally estab-
lished the validity of parachute
and glider technique by proving
that such operations could be
carried out in broad daylight in
the face of a heavily armed,
desperate and prepared enemy.
The Arnhem operation by the
British Sixth Airborne Division
was thus carried out to seize
river-crossings between Eind-
hoven and Arnhem and help our
large-scale advance and isolate
German divisions in the west of
Holland. The photographs
prove that the troops came down
literally as thick as autumn
leaves—in bright sunlight after
they had been flown a long dis-
tance behind the packed front
lines of the enemy.
The same conditions prevailed
when “Operation Varsity” took
a large airborne force beyond
the Rhine bridgehead already
established to demoralise the
German counter - attack and
break down their communica-
tions —this was done by the
British 6th and U.S. 17th Air-
borne Divisions, between 10 a.m.
and 1 p.m. on March 24, 1945.
Less than four per cent, of air-
craft were lost, despite the fact
that the Germans knew full well
that the success of the operation
must mean the forcing of the
gateway to the core of German
defence.
Australian Target
Inquisitive members of the
Opposition at Canberra might
do a useful job if they were to
inquire of Mr. Chifley what
would be likely to happen if an
enemy of this country decided
to use a lightly armed airborne
division, flown off in a few
dozen crates of the class of the
U.S. C-82, which can handle 50
troops doing simultaneous
double-jumps from two doors, all
along the north or east coast, with
the preliminary objective of para-
lysing industry, cutting lateral
communications and establish-
ing bridgeheads and pockets.
If an enemy were to take it
into his head to operate in that
way within the next few months
if the job were done
with the pre-knowledge and help
of a treacherous internal enemy
like the Communist party—there
could only be one result.
Though Mr. Chifley’s cries for
help might ultimately be an-
swered, parts of Australia would
either enjoy the sensations of
occupied France or find them-
selves without industrial
potential. If politicians don’t
believe this even a casual read-
ing of Group-Captain Maurice
Newnham’s Prelude to Glory,
which tells the story of the
creation of Britain’s Parachute
Army, should convince them.
It would be a good idea if
somebody of the calibre and ex-
perience of Group - Captain
Newnham were invited to Aus-
tralia to survey the aerial-in-
vasion problem in the light of
greater experience than we seem
to have in the Commonwealth in
the matter.
Britain's New Alliance.
Evidently the British Foreign
Secretary regarded the “Prime
Ministers’ conference” i n
London without Canada’s Mr.
St. Laurent as something like
“Hamlet” without the Prince of
Denmark. For, though he
addressed the delegations last
week, he reserved his comments
[he said] on the international
situation—of which the core, for
conference digestion, is the
Western Union commitments of
Britain —until this week, when
Mr. St. Laurent should arrive.
This was not mere compliment
to the Canadian Prime Minister-
elect. Mr. St. Laurent, as Secre-
tary for External Affairs last
June, is the only spokesman for
a Dominion who has unequi-
vocally ranged Canada alongside
Britain in this regional pact.
This is how he spoke to the
Canadian House of Commons
about the time Mr. Chifley was
preparing to go to London to
make up his mind about this and
some other matters:
In the event of war which affected
Britain and the U.S.A., Canada would
be inevitably involved. In such cir-
cumstances he saw great value from
the prior existence of a regional pact
between the countries of Western
Europe, Britain, the U.S.A. and
Canada If countries on the North
Atlantic seaboard agreed to stand
together, to pool their respective
potentials for defence purposes, and
to co-ordinate their forces right away,
it would be made plain to any
aggressor country that it would have
to overcome a unified group if it
attempted any aggression
“We are hopeful that the Western
Union will develop into something
that will comprise the U.S.A. along
with those who are already members,
and in the event we think the people
of Canada would wish also to be
associated with it because we
realise that if the group in this
regional pact were involved in war
we should necessarily be involved.”
Mr. Bevin is plainly depend-
ing on Mr. St. Laurent to set the
tone for the senior Dominions at
the conference.
It is past understanding why
Australia —which would be just
as “inevitably involved” in a
war which implicated Britain
and America —could not from
the outset have ranged herself
alongside Britain in support of
the Western Union —that is, the
Treaty of Brussels, by which
Britain, France and the three
small Low Countries signed a
50-year agreement for co-opera-
tion in restoring European
economic prosperity, assurance
to their peoples of freedom
under the U.N. Charter, and a
defensive military alliance, with
joint staff planning, in defence
of the Western Union against all
aggression.
It is this joint defence com-
mittee to which Field-Marshal
Lord Montgomery has been ap-
pointed chairman. He has al-
ready handed over his duties as
Chief of the Imperial General
Staff in Britain to General Sir
William Slim.

Another instance of the courage and
adaptability of the blind, J. H. Papesch,
of Auckland, is olf to England to qualify
as a Fellow of the Royal College of
Organists. Musical director of the Blind
Institute in Auckland, he secured his
Bachelor of Music degree two years ago.
When learning a new piece he has first
of all to convert the score into Braille.
Then he reads this score with one hand,
plays with the other, reverses the process
until he has memorised it, and is then
ready for a finished performance with
both hands.
A signal honor has been accorded
H. R. Marston, of Adelaide C.S.I.R.
division of biochemistry. The Royal
Society has asked him to lecture at its
London headquarters on his contributory
research leading to a major discovery in
the treatment of pernicious anaemia in
humans. He is the first Australian to be
so invited. Last month British research-
workers isolated, for the first time, 100th
of an ounce of a new anaemia curative
agent containing cobalt from eight tons of
liver. Marston’s research in this connec-
tion attracted world-wide interest, and,
after conferring with English colleagues,
he will return to Adelaide in December
to continue research into his belief that
cobalt, as well as being of primary im-
portance to man, is an essential dietary
constituent for sheep and cattle,
C. L. Lewis, Commonwealth Loans
head in N.S.W. (B. 13/10/’4B), had his
most uncomfortable experience in his
quest for Loan-money on a trip he made
in a destroyer down Port Phillip Bay;
his most embarrassing was a Martin-place
rally whereat manufacturing concerns had
been invited to display, exhibits symbolis-
ing their transition from war-time to
peace activities. He couldn’t be expected
to know that a firm which had been mak-
ing parachutes was now making bathing-
suits, and its beach-girl display brought
a storm of criticism on the Deputy-
Director’s head. The National Quiz has
brought mild complaints —mostly on the
ground that the Commonwealth is
“hogging the air,” but Lewis maintains
that approval far outweighs complaints
and that the Quiz is the most successful
stunt the Organisation has tried *
Just completed 25 years as a Melbourne
City Councillor, Edgar Leslie Morton
raised a rumpus in the hand-carved-oak
council chamber recently when he urged
the City Fathers to “scrub” the present
street lighting and instal sodium lamps.
Like most of his suggestions, it was
strongly criticised, but if the council fol-
lows its previous line the sodium lights
should be burning soon. A former
student of Melbourne Tech., Morton
is now chairman of the school council,
and has sponsored a competition among
students for a design for Melbourne’s
Royal Ball invitation card. He is keenly
interested in the city’s water supply
through his long association with the
Metropolitan Board and frequently takes
politicians to O’Shannessy’s reservoir for
the week-end. A practical-joker, he
leavened the bitter campaign for Lord
Mayor by issuing a race-card for the
“Lord-Mayoral Stakes” and posting it
anonymously to every councillor,
“Trinco”: Commander Bob Jackson, the Aus-
tralian who was recently discharged from his
job of U.N.O. Assistant Secretary-General—he
was the ninth to hold it, and the post has been
abolished —was described by American papers
as a “trouble-shooter.” Some seemed to think
his inability to get along with Count Bernadotte
was the reason for dismissal. Whatever it was,
U.N.O. lost a great organiser. Jackson was a
paymaster in the R.A.N., and was transferred
to the staff of the flag officer-in-charge, Malta,
in 1937. In 1941, when the island was fighting
for its life, he was given the job of organising
its supplies. HoW he did it is history; and it
won him an 0.8. E. In 1942 he expanded his
organisational genius to cover supply-lines for
the whole of the Middle East —for this, a
C.M.G. His job with U.N.O. took him wherever
special troubles arose. One of his most hushed
tasks was to try to induce Ernest Bevin last
May to press the Arabs into halting the Palestine
war during U.N.O.’s peace efforts. Later, back in
his old stamping-ground, he went to Rhodes
to help Bernadotte in co-ordinating assistance
for 400,000 Arab and Jewish refugees from the
Holy Land. A letter from Trygve Lie to Jack-
son praised his “outstanding ability” and “high
qualities of mind and character.” It also severed
him from the payroll.
Dr, Sidney Arthur Leader, a Dover
medico who claims he has saved Britain
£3 million in four years, is now in Mel-
bourne. Some years ago he began
specialising in plastic for surgical instru-
ments and spare parts for the human
body. His inventiveness has since pro-
duced every imaginable gadget from
a device to prevent snoring to artificial
teeth that faithfully perpetuate the previ-
ous habits of the user. He has made
Britain self-supporting in the glass-eye
industry, and his factories are con-
sidered important enough for the Govern-
ment to buy 70 p.c. of their output to
save dollars. He has come here to estab-
lish a plastic industry worth a million.
When Jack Ludowici’s father started his
tanning business at Lane Cove, Sydney,
midway through last century, the quickest
way for hides to get there was to walk.
Now the business has grown into one of
the largest of its kind in Australia, and
sends its Mangrovite belting to mining
concerns throughout the world. Jack
(naturally known as Ludo), at 84, is still
chairman of directors. One Riverview
College boy won’t forget the tannery in
a hurry. With a party being shown
round he stepped across what he thought
was solid brown earth, but what, as he
discovered when he’d come up for the
third time, was a vat full of tanning
liquid. Of course they called him Stinker.
Ludowici recently presented, through the
Master Tanners’ Association, an ox-hide
to the U.N. Children’s Emergency Fund.
Auctioned in Sydney, it brought over
£l2OO.
The Rev. Robert Jardine, who defied
the Church of England by marrying the

“Uramao”: The appointment of G. R.
Manton, senior lecturer in classics at
Sydney University, as professor of classics
at Otago University, is a reminder that
it’s not all one-way traffic in educational
appointments between Australia and
N.Z. At present there are eight mem-
bers of the Otago Uni. with Australian
degrees. These are professors of music,
dentistry, physiology, geology, economics
and education, and senior lecturers in
physics and mathematics. Until recently
Professor Hunter occupied the chair of
Hebrew and Dr. Lawson that of educa-
tion. The preference of Australian Scotch
colleges for Maorilanders is offset by
the number of Australians teaching the
young idea at Scotch institutions in New
Zealand. Knox College, which keeps the
faith of John alive in Maoriland’s
Dunedin, was during its early years under
the mastership of two Australian-degree
men. Professor Hewitson, of Melbourne,
and Dr. Merrington, of Sydney.
David Quayle, recently appointed
manager of the Victorian Government’s
fish hatcheries at Snob’s Creek, near
Alexandra, knows more about fish habits
than most anglers learn in a lifetime. In
1939 he investigated the serious decline in
the size and condition of trout in Lake
Catani, on top of Mount Buffalo. His
remedy was to neutralise the acidity of
the lake water and to establish aquatic
plants and insects. The result is 41-
pounders at three years. Former secre-
tary and research-officer of the Ballarat
Fish Acclimatisation Society, he is one
of the few who can determine a trout’s
age by its scales.
Revisiting Maoriland, where he won a
Rhodes scholarship a few yeafs ago, Dan
Davki, author of For the Rest of Our
Lives, is back to write a history of the
N.Z. Division in the Cretan campaign.
He will interview Governor-General
Freyberg and others with first-hand know-
ledge of the show. When the war ended
Davin joined the Clarendon Press at
Oxford, and he will return to London as
assistant-secretary to that house.
The Victorian Artists’ Society’s new
secretary is a soldier, not an artist, whose
interest in art came largely through
marriage. He is Lieut.-Colonel A. W.
Hewson, late of the Royal Garhwal
Rifles, an Indian Army regiment which
recruits its men from the wild tribes of the
Himalayas. He came to Australia in
1937 and married Phyllis Dare, grand-
daughter of I. H. Moss, whose collection
of antiques and pictures was one of Aus-
tralia’s largest. The society has lately got
a new lease of life and many new
members, and Colonel Hewson will or-
ganise sales of members’ pictures and
exhibitions. There are not enough of the
former and too many of the latter.
Dr. Arnold Ennor, appointed Professor
of Biochemistry at the National Univer-
sity at Canberra, is Melboume-bom and
had a brilliant career at the University
there before going to Oxford as a re-
search biochemist. Lacking the where-
withal to pay his fees beyond the High
School standard, he took a bottlewashing
job at the Baker Institute of the Alfred
Hospital; and returned to the institute
as a scientist after graduation. Now
35, he engaged in research during the
late war in the Department of Munitions,
and in 1946 was awarded a fellowship by
the Wellcome Foundation.
New principal of Fairholme College,
Toowoomba (Q.), Rev, N. H. Joughin,
M.A., 8.D., Minister of St. Stephens
Presbyterian Church, was a student at
Scotch College, Melbourne. At Mel-
bourne Uni. he took honors each year in
the school of classical philology, and won
a final honors scholarship in classics and
the Wyselaski Scholarship in classical
philology and logic. Tie is the entrance

Herbert Roy Gollan, Australia’s new
High Commissioner in India, first got to

of the Australian National Travel Asso-
ciation, and for the past nine years has

with D. 5.0., M.C. and three “mentions,”
and ended up manager of Melbourne
“Argus.” He acted for the last four years
as commercial counsellor to the man he
replaces, Lieut.-General Iven Mackay.
“Telarb”: Probably the best-known
whites in Torres Strait are Philip Frith
and his wife, who is matron-in-charge
of the Western Islands hospital on Badu,
where Frith is the Government teacher.
Their three children were born and
raised in the Straits —a tribute to the
mother who also educated them. A keen
historian and Straits geographer, Frith
hopes next year to open a secondary
school, in which he’ll train promising
native nippers as teachers, store-managers
and officials. Crammed with anecdotal
vitality, Frith makes a visit to Badu
station something to remember.

Womem's Letters
From Sydney
Ypu can’t forget the fair at Gray-
thwaite next Saturday afternoon. Gray-
thwaite has been one of the Red
Cross homes for disabled soldiers since
World War I. William Morris Hughes
will be again on'deck to declare the fair
open.
What a lot of spit-an’-polish goes into
that officers’ mess at Victoria Barracks,
where the Eastern Command Women’s
Auxiliary was intent on bridge for the
War Widows’ Guild last Wednesday
afternoon. It was a joy to see the
speckless shine of the leather armchairs
on the verandah. Noticed also for the
first time the King’s monogram on the
cannon guarding the steps and their neat
and complete slogan: Honi Soit and all
that. It seemed a nice aperitif for the
enemy before his appetite was glutted
with shot. But within the mess there
was no warlike atmosphere. Mrs. Paddy
Moore, busy totting-up at the end of the
day, was making it £4B 18s. And there
was probably another trickle of silver
from the sales of cakes and flowers.
President Mrs. Berryman was slim in
black, and her black chip-straw hat wore
a pink rose at the side. Aide-ing her
was the wife of Colonel Mann, dress and
hat in tones of jade. Major Joyce
Snelling was among the players—very
pleased with her ankle-strap shoes after
so many service stalwarts.
In choosing the pretty little St.
Augustine’s Church, Neutral Bay, for her
wedding, Patricia Eileen (Pat) Burge is
following the example set by sister Wendy
and her mother. At four o’clock to-
morrow afternoon Pat will become Mrs.
Joseph Scholey Bragg, and later Mr. and
Mrs. H. R. Burge will entertain at Elanora
Country Club.
Sydney is pleasantly excited over Mrs.
Margaret Fielding-Jones’s wedding in
London. Lucky man is Maynard Jenour,
and they were wed in Christ Church,
Mayfair, last week. The fair Margaret
was one of Sydney’s young and pretty
widows and was a keen worker for Red
Cross, Legacy, the Kindergarten Move-
ment and other welfare organisations.
She was attended by daughter Annette,
and Lord and Lady Gowrie were among
the guests. Mrs. Jenour is the only child
of the late Stuart Osborne and Mrs.
Osborne, of Darling Point, Another of
the bride’s pretty daughters, Moana, is
still thrilled by the long telephone talk
she had with her mother and sister, tell-
ing her all about the wedding and how
beautifully everything went off.
One of many pre-wedding parties given
to Rosalie Carter had Kathleen Gaden,
her first friend in Sydney, as hostess.
Rosalie and fiance Malcolm Davis (by
now they are man and wife) were sur-
rounded by about 60 friends in the club-
rooms of the Overseas League at a buffet
dinner. As usual Kathleen dispensed
sumptuous and really hot food. Her
red-and-white-patterned silk frock had
what the fashion jourhals call the “Now”
look, its skirts full but not replete.
Rosalie’s good looks were cameo-like in
a setting of navy faille. Also at the party
were her sister and brother-in-law, the
T. R. Wassons. Her father and mother,
Colonel and Mrs. Carter, and Mrs.
Gaden were in the company. The
Carters are an English family, and the
Colonel has an amazing record of war
service and adventure. Among other
achievements he was with Lawrence in
Arabia.
The Spain that was before Franco,
before the Moors, the Spain that Borrow
sensed and attempted to describe,
burst into vivid life before the eyes of a
Town Hall audience last week. Sydney
is unaccustomed to seeing the dances of
Spain interpreted by one of Spanish
blood. But from the first brilliant
cadenza of La Joselito’s castanets, herald-
ing her entry, there was the thrill of ex-
pectancy. Spanish dancing seems to be a
wild ecstasy of the emotions, and La
Joselito has her art in her fingers, her
toes, and even in the vibrancy of her
heels. Her vivid costumes, the rich lace
of her mantillas, the jewelled combs in
her satin-smooth black hair made a
dazzling picture. .
The pianist, Mercedes Bebia, plays with
charm and no nonsense and takes her
applause with a gracious little bow from
the piano-stool. After listening to Juan
Relampago one no longer wondered why
the guitar plays so important a part (ac-
cording to the operas) in Spanish wooings.
La Joselito comes to Sydney on her way
from Paris to the Argentine, to U.S. and
then to Canada. In the gardens of her
home outside Paris she grows trees and
shrubs from almost every country she has
visited. She will take boronia from Aus-
tralia.
Mary Kathleen Vivian Williams and
Dr. Vennard Francis O’Neill (Bill to his
friends) were married in the chapel of
Riverview, the ’groom’s old college,
recently. Mary’s frock was a froth of
white silk marquisette on moire, her
veil a fine web of Limerick lace
on tulle, and the orange blossom in her
hair had been worn by both her grand-
mother and her mother. The trainbearer
was young John Wightman, whose father.
Dr. Denis Wightman, had officiated in
like manner at Mrs. Williams’s wedding.
Matron-of-honor, Mrs. Anthony Bretting-
ham Moore, and the bridesmaid, Norma
Cole, wore attractive frocks of moon-
stone-blue, very long and swirling into
fullness. Best man and groomsman were
Brian and Gerald O’Neill. Mrs. Kathleen
Williams, the bride’s mother, who enter-
tained after the wedding at Amory, wore
an ensemble of mushroom crepe. Her
flower-trimmed hat was of green rough
straw. Pale blue with touches of deep
coral were worn by the ’groom’s mother.
Among the Consular group in Sydney
and Canberra there is no more popular
hostess than the lady in this picture, Mrs.
Lars J. Hvinden Jorstad, wife of the
Minister of Norway in Australia.
Every woman of discernment in the
matter of arts and crafts knows the shop
run by the War Widows’ Guild in Rowe-
street. Everything that can be woven or
contrived by clever fingers is there for
sale, or can be ordered —from long, white
gloves to the most fascinating rugs. To
help the War Widows’ Guild of Aus-
tralia a buffet dinner dance has been
arranged by Mrs. Elaine Wagstaff for
next Saturday evening. Doings start
with cocktails at 7.30, and Legion House,
161 Castlereagh-street, is the address.
Always well in the picture, artist
Jocelyn Rickards is opening her exhibi-
tion in the Macquarie Galleries with a
sherry party—and that bang in the middle
of Wine Week. Noon is the hour.
Alec Murray’s album of Personalities
in Australia is an entertaining social
Who’s Who. It contains photographs
(with personal pars, alongside) of every-
one social and artistic, or even “arty,”
in Sydney, Adelaide and Melbourne.
The theatre, too, makes entry. Kathleen
Robinson, of Minerva Theatre fame, is
outstanding. The photography is excel-
lent, and the explanatory lines are
adjectival only in the laudatory sense.
Everybody in the book is beautiful,
brilliant, full of charm and so
forth. Amusing in its gossipy way, it
is a useful reference book for any
columnist. Alec Murray is now in
London doing work for “Vogue.” Per-
sonalities in Australia is a Sydney Ure
Smith publication, which means just
about perfection in printing and make-up.
Benoni Edye, second daughter of
Sydney’s Dr. Ben Edye, had a birthday
last week-end, and from 150 miles beyond
Brisbane came her aunt, Mrs. G. F. S.
Lee, to act as hostess. Glad tidings were
in a letter from Stephanie Edye, now
billed as Consuelo Alba in Paris, or
maybe by this time Spain. She has just
signed a long-term contract with the
Daphne Deane management, and may
tour Spain in a special ballet presented
by De Basil. Before going to Europe
Daphne directed ballet classes at the Con-
servatorium. She spent the war years in
occupied France.
Coloratura soprano Gladys Verona,
one of this city’s leading singers of
Mozart, gives a recital in the Conserva-
torium tonight. Works by Brahms,
Handel, Scarlatti and other composers are
also on the bill. Adrian Holland is the
pianist.
Do not forget the Australian Armored
Corps Association’s annual ball on Fri-
day night, October 22, at the Trocadero.
From Melbourne
The Caulfield Cup was minus its usual
fashion parade. Women, warned by a
rapidly falling barometer and a high gusty
wind, decided to dress for comfort, and, if
a pretty silk ensemble was chosen, the
wearer took coat and umbrella. But the
rain held off, and in brilliant sunshine the
thousands saw Red Fury win. The smart
grey suit with London-tan or other
colorful accessories was an easy winner
in the day’s fashions. Green in all shades,
from deep bottle to light lime and
Chartreuse, was next in popularity, with
blue running a place. Mrs. McKell chose
a delphinium-blue suit with pipings of a
lighter blue velvet on the jacket and seams
of the skirt; her small straw hat was in
a paler blue and had lilac and red roses
at one side. Daughter Betty also wore
blue—a jacket suit in soft hyacinth and
a wide-brimmed felt hat trimmed with a
black patent-leather belt and gold studs.
They were the guests at luncheon of Mrs.
Norman Robinson, wife of the V.A.T.C.
chairman, and she was in navy-blue, re-
lieved by a white and navy-blue straw
hat, oyer which was a fine wool coat with
the skirt falling in unpressed pleats. An-
other guest was Mrs. Kenneth McLean,
who wore gardenias in the navy-blue coat
she wore over a white-and-blue-printed
frock ; her elliptical white straw hat was
tied on with veiling. Lady Mayoress
Disney chose a smart black suit and black
hat with a veil decorated with tiny pink
flowers.
Mrs. H. R. Way, wife of the
V.A.T.C. secretary, was in a smartly-
tailored grey-and-white-pencil-striped suit,
her matching grey hat edged with white.
Her guests at luncheon included Mrs.
I. T. Rowe (Sydney), Mrs. M. P. Reid
(Adelaide) and Mrs. J. D. Mustow. Filmy
white lace was seen at the cuffs and in the
blouse worn by Mrs. A. Silk with her
smart grey suit. Her grey pancake hat
was trimmed with soft matching satin
ribbon, spangled with silver sequins.
With her jacket suit of leaf-green wool
Mrs. W. K. Burnside wore a large natural
straw hat trimmed with green roses. Mrs.
McL. Falkiner chose a grey suit with a
small grey bowler hat and over the face
a brown veil. Two smart racegoers were
Marie McGrath, whose high swathed
turban of gold, brown and rUsset chiffon
was worn with a slim beige frock and red
fox bolero, and Shirley Barry, whose
navy-blue check on off-white boucle linen
was worn with a platter hat of natural
straw, trimmed and edged with cyclamen
and green.
The lass who smiles so delightfully
from this picture is Moira, daughter of
Dr. and Mrs. Percy Shelton, of Elstern-
wick. Educated at Mandeville Hall,
Moira went on to the Uni. and became a
B.Sc. In the W.A.A.A.F. she was a flight-
officer working in the Chemical Warfare
Department. Her engagement to Kevin,
only son of Mr. and Mrs. L. P. Coleman,
was recently announced. Kevin is doing
law at the Uni., after war service with
the Army. Moira worked hard as ticket-
secretary for the St. Vincent’s Hospital
Ball.
Decorated with masses of greenery
and large bowls of mixed flowers, the
Palais Royale was the setting for St.
Vincent’s Hospital Ball on Caulfield Cup
eve. On the supper-tables were bowls
of flowers, and balloons added a festive
note. Lud Mayor Disney and his lady
were guests of honor, and in the official
party was the honorary medical staff of
St. Vincent’s. To welcome them Mrs.
L. R. Buxton, the Jball president, wore
pink and silver French tissue covered by
a silver lame coat. The Lady Mayoress
chose bronze faille, which featured a self-
spot, and the skirt, draped at the hips,
was drawn to the back in a full bustle.
Antique gold jewellery made a perfect
foil. Mrs, Buxton’s daughter Beverley,
one of the five young hostesses, wore
green faille, handpaihted with gold
flowers, and made with a wide, bouffant
skirt which emphasised the small waist
and off-the-shoulder bodice. Moira
Shelton, one of the ticket assistants, chose
a hyacinth-blue, shot-with-cyclamen
brocade gown fashioned with a bouffant
skirt and petal shoulder-straps. Betty
Conroy, a bridesmaid at the Smiley-
Westhoven wedding the day before, wore
her bridesmaid frock of maize marquis-
ette, and Sheila Thonneman chose ice-
blue tulle. Mrs. H. Furnell, accompanied
by Brigadier Furnell, chose a slim-fitting
gown of dusty-pink crepe, and Mrs. John
O’Driscoll’s attractive gown was of ice-
blue chiffon, the skirt featuring bands of
black lace which matched the lace trim-
ming the low-cut bodice. Orchids were
worn Mrs. L. Claridge with her aqua-
blue crepe frock, trimmed with gold
sequins.
To celebrate its second birthday, the
Women’s Services Club gave a cheery
late-afternoon party in the clubrooms in
Market-street. Lieut.-Gen. Sturdee, Chief
of the General Staff, cut the birthday
cake and then blew out the two candles.
Mrs. C. Hollingsworth, who served \yith
the Red Cross during the war, made the
cake. Mrs. C. F. Trathan, president of
the committeee of management, received
the guests with the vice-presidents, Mrs.
R. Hamilton Williams, wearing a smart
navy-blue ensemble. May McLean, in a
black frock and matching halo hat, and
the former president, Nell Rawlins. Mrs.
Trathan chose grey and wore a small
green-ribbon-trimmed grey hat. Other
Service chiefs present included Lieut.-
Gen. Clowes, G.0.C., Southern Com-
mand, Commander Barwood, represent-
ing the Navy, and Air-Commodore Allan
Walters, representing the R.A.A.F. Other
hostesses included Miriel Cheney, very
smart in lime-green, Peg Dwyer, in
snuff-brown corduroy velvet and match-
ing brown hat, and Betty Brown, whose
choice was a cinnamon-brown suit and
hat.
China’s National Day was celebrated
by members of the Australia-China
Association at a luncheon in the Empire-
room of the Hotel “Federal. Guests were
received by the president, S. L. Prescott,
and secretary, Lois Savage. She chose a
trim, brown tailored ensemble and off-the-
face ribbon-trimmed matching hat. The
Consul-General for the U.S.A., J, S.
Fletcher, and Mrs. Fletcher, sat at the
official table with the Consul for China,
L. Martin Wang, Air-Marshal George
Jones and Mrs. Jones, she in a smart
black suit and black hat with pale pink
French roses nestling under the brim.
Mrs, F. H. Wright, wife of the Consul for
the Netherlands, deputised for her
husband and also chose black for her
ensemble.
On October 25 Lady Dunstan will open
the Market Fair organised by the com-
bined auxiliaries of the Women’s Hos-
pital. Highlights are a hat bar, lucky
envelopes, a refreshment stall where
home-cooked meat and salads will be
served, a pie-stall, where housewives may
purchase large or small pies, and a variety
of stalls selling Christmas gifts. All
women are invited ; funds for the hospital
are urgently needed.
June Manson should assist her cause
in the “Miss Australia Quest” with the
proceeds of a dinner dance held in the
Australia’s Venetian Court. Highlight
was the mannequin parade of furs, lent
by Seymour Furs. June wore a pretty
white crepe gown, slimly cut and em-
broidered on the neckline and edges of
the short sleeves with blue-and-silver
beads. Among the girls who acted as
mannequins was Mrs. Athol Shmith,
whose white crepe gown was made with
a strapless top and full, graceful skirt.
Among the guests was Darilyn Court,
from Brisbane, whose sun-bronzed skin
was the envy of many and was set off
to perfection with a blue-and-white
patterned linen gown, the top featuring a
halter neckline. Sonia O’Brien contrasted
her fair coloring with a brilliant-red
dinner-gown, and Elizabeth Taylor added
a sequin-starred sari to her ensemble of
powder-blue crepe with sequin embroi-
deries, Her mother, Mrs. Margaret
Saker, also chose blue, and, as organiser
of the “Miss Australia Quest” in this
city, was mightily pleased with the night’s
doings. Joan Lean wore a suave white
silk Jersey gown with a swathed bodice,
and Loris Netfleberg bared her pretty
shoulders in a bouffant gown of black
velvet. Mrs. Marshall Gibson’s unusual
gown featured a brown-and-gold-check
taffeta skirt allied to a bodice of gold
taffeta. Verna Shmith chose filmy black
net with a draped hipline of the net em-
broidered in silver sequins.
Helen Elizabeth, twin daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. C. D. McMicking, of Brighton
Beach, wore her grandmother’s Honiton
lace veil when she was married to Francis
Reed Officer in the Melbourne Grammar
School Chapel. The veil floated over a
magnolia-satin gown featuring a swathed
hipline which formed a bustle bow at the
back, with the ends falling into a train.
She carried a bouquet of cream roses.
Bouffant frocks of lime-green marquisette
were worn by the matron-of-honor, Mrs.
Jim Derham, who is the bride’s twin
sister, and the bridesmaid, Susan Hanlon,

On the shipping side the co is still
“hove-to in a fog.” Its fleet—2B vessels,
of which six are passenger and the
balance cargo—aggregating 76,274 tons,
is the largest engaged in the Australian
coastal trade. Yet it is ancillary interests
that now provide most of the dividend.
These interests include substantial hold-
ings in J. and A. Brown and Abermain-
Seaham Collieries, A.N.A., A.W.A., New-
stead Wharves and Stevedoring Co. (Bris-
bane), Waratah Tug and Salvage Co, and
Port Adelaide Steam Laundry, which
looks after the fleet’s linen. In addition
there are the co.’s own tugs, lighters,
engineering shops, etc., and a holding of
£1,599,889 in Government securities and
cash.
After allowing for depreciation and
“all other charges,” but including £15,000
(down £5000) tossed into the insurance
reserve (£490,000), there was a contrac-
tion of £15,005 in last term’s net earn-
ings. Nothing was abided to the repairs
reserve, etc. (£353,500, up £lO,OOO in the
previous term), because “the cost of main-
tenance and repairs has been extremely
heavy.” The £154,451 of profit was 6.6
p.c. on capital compared with 7.2, 7.2
and 8.2 p.c. for the three preceding
terms. The div. was kept at 6 p.c., and
it is difficult to say when better might
be expected.
During the Government requisition
period charter rates were more in the
nature of austere compensation than an
adequate return for use of the ships.
The Manunda, one of the co.’s two big
inter-State passenger vessels, took up the
running again in April last, but it v/ill be
some lime before the other one, the
Manoora, now being refitted, is back in
the trade again. The Dundula, damaged
in August, 1947, had to be towed to
Melbourne for repairs, cost of which
appears to have been covered by out-
side underwriters. As for the rest of
the fleet, the portion engaged on the
South Aust. coast is still operating at a
“substantial” loss, and the remainder is
earning an inadequate return on capital
involved, after allowing for maintenance
and depreciation, now much heavier
charges than they used to be.
Chief bottleneck is the ports, where
ships now spend about two-thirds of the
round-voyage time as against one-third
pre-war. That is because of go-slow and
industrial stoppages on the wharves and
the effects of the 40-hour week. An
attempt to quicken cargo throughput by
mechanisation has failed, because the
“darg” is now as much in practice on the
wharves as in the coalmines. It all means
still further lifts in freight-rates and loss
to the public as well as the co., because
higher freight and handling charges ex-
press themselves in higher prices for
goods, and, if carried far enough, in un-
employment, too.
Some idea of the mess into which the
Government has landed the industry can
be gathered from the fact that, in its
requisitioned-tonnage section, the Shipping
Board made a loss of £8,608,000 from its
inception in 1941 to end June, 1947. Now
private enterprise is left to struggle with
the chaos that was largely responsible for
the loss, while the Government says what
freight- and passage-rates are to be
charged, when ships are to be scrapped
and where they are to be built. And,
despite a previous costly failure, the Gov-
ernment again proposes to set up a Com-
monwealth shipping line.
The next table shows how well-ribbed
the co. is financially:

hopes for improvement of conditions in
the trade, and prices the pound shares at

* Before providing for taxation, t After deducting
intangibles (£17,447). 4 For six months only.
Latest accounts cover the first full year
since the change in balancing date from
January to July. The £53,228 of profit,
18.6 p.c. on capital, was easily the best in
the co.’s 15 years’ trading. It was written
after providing £12,115 for depreciation
and £40,000 for taxation, but leaves out
of the figuring £ll,OOO sent to reserves
from overprovision for taxation in pre-
vious years. Allowing for adjustments in
connection with War-time (Co.) Tax, the
£53,228 compares with £45,198, or 15.8
p.c. on capital, for the 12 months to end
January, 1947 (when depreciation and
tax provisions were £13,010 and £39,000
respectively), and 10.6 p.c. and 8.2 p.c.
for the two years before that. The div.,
which stepped up from 5 p.c. in 1941 to
6 p.c. for each of the three following
years, advanced by annual steps to 10 p.c,
p.a. for the last 18 months. And when
the books last closed shareholders could
see all their capital intact and £69,481
besides —intangibles (£17,447) are not
treated as an asset herein.
It has been a very good recovery con-
sidering the size of the business, the
faltering start it made and the none-too-
stout prop for capital. The co. entered
the field against keen competition in 1933,
when it opened its first store opposite
Coles in Pitt-street, Sydney. Now it has
a chain of 16 stores, all in N. S. Wales,
and two subsidiaries, one in Maoriland
and the other in Westralia. Until mid-
-1938, when there were changes in the
control, progress was more apparent than
real. And too much notice need not be
taken of the profit figures for the five
years to 1944, because no specific pro-
vision was made for taxation and there
were delays in assessments. Total assess-
ments for this period amounted to about
£114,000, leaving the average net result
at approximately £20,700, or 7.2 p.c. on
capital. Over the same period divs.
averaged 4.6 p.c.
Among other things, it all suggests
careful reorganisation, good buying and
a tight hold upon controllable outgoings.
Certainly the chain stores and other re-
tailers have never enjoyed easier trading
conditions. For over a decade the story
has been one of advancing turnovers, fol-
lowing war-time inflation and post-war
scarcities, rising prices, full employment
and recurrent wage-lifts, with the tempo
quickening since V.P.-Day. Moreover,
the gains from expanding turnover have
so far outdistanced advancing costs, the
impact of which was softened a little by
abolition of War-time (Co.) Tax —
£14,000 provided for the purpose in 1947
was transferred to reserves. How long
the sellers’ market will continue it is diffi-
cult to say. Signs are not wanting, here
and overseas, of approaching changes in
trading conditions. But in the present dis-
turbed state of international politics, as
well as in the domestic affairs of many
countries, he would be a bold man who
would venture to predict exactly what will
happen, and when.
The market expresses its opinion by
pricing the f.-p. pound shares at 475. 4d.,
at which figure the return is 4.2 p.c. on a
10 p.c. div. basis. Net tangible cover is
245. lid.

Greater Union Theatres Group
Recently announced profits of Greater
Union Theatres Pty., Ltd., relate back to
the year ended December 31, 1947 ; they
show further progress in the strong march
to recovery that began in 1939 and en-
abled a resumption of dividend payments
to the holding cos. in 1942, after a break
of 13 years. Freer public spending in
war-time was partly responsible for the
transformation, but Greater Union
specially benefited from a fine vintage of
British releases. That link was reinforced
early in 1946 when J. Arthur Rank, the
emperor of British filmdom and holder
of a one-third share in Universal Films
of Hollywood, took up a half-interest in
the proprietary. For 200,000 ords. the
Rank organisation paid f'Zc’OjOOO to the
four Australian holding cos., which were
able to reinvest £500,000 of the cash soon
afterwards in a par issue of 5 p.c. prefs.
by the proprietary. Thaf all four cos.
recorded higher profits last term (ending
June 30 in their case) was due almost
entirely to the receipt of a full year’s
dividend from the subsidiary as against a
two months’ payment in 1947.
Of the group’s nation-wide chain of 115
theatres, nearly half are in N.S.W., in-
cluding five city houses controlled directly
(State, Lyceum, Victory, Capitol, Lyric)
and three others run in association with
Hoyts, the big rival circuit (Embassy,
Empire, King’s Cross). Of Sydney’s 160
or so suburban houses, Greater Union
manages 37, besides another 16 elsewhere
in N. S. Wales.
The second stronghold is S. Australia,
where the group operates 27 houses.
Victorian interests are confined to three
metropolitan theatres —Hoyts being much
stronger in that State —but in Queensland
Greater Union is linked with the Birch
Carroll Country circuit besides controlling
the Brisbane Tivoli. Three cinemas in
Tasmania and two in Westralia complete
the tally.
Operating Companies.— Profit, but
not balance-sheet, figures are published
for the six operating cos. Two of them
are sub-subsidiaries of Greater Union
Theatres Pty.; these are Cinesound, the
weekly-newsreel makers, and Union
Theatres Investment, Ltd., owners and
managers of the 11-storied State building
in Market-street, Sydney. The other
three subsidiaries are engaged in renting
films, selling equipment and making edu-
cational reels.
Thirty-one new cinemas had joined
the circuit in 1947, which partly explains
the better showing of G.U.T. Pty.:

In each of the above years £37,500 of
the dividends was paid to the Rank
interest. The total credit balance in
profit-and-loss accounts of the six cos.
last December is quoted at £479,907 ;
whether they have other reserves, or how
much of this figure is subject to intan-
gibles, isn’t known.
It is by no means certain that the
general falling-off in cinema attendances
since war-time had stabilised itself by
December, 1947, when these accounts
were prepared. Though the subsidiaries
paid their last divs. with a comfortable
margin, film-exhibiting is a business where
any decline in turnover may entail not
a proportionate but practically an equi-
valent drop in net profits. The board
hasn’t commented on the possible loss
of the Capitol leasehold (Sydney) for
railway resumptions.
Holding Companies.— All four Aus-
tralian holding cos. raised their divs.
last year: West’s to 7 p.c., Amalgamated
Pictures to 6% p.c., Spencer’s and Greater
J. D. Williams to 6 p.c. At current mar-
ket prices, their shares compare thus:
f Shares 7-v

West’s .. .. 13.10 26 0 24 3 6.0
Amalg. Pictures .. 7.30 24 3 21 0 6.2
Asset backing is taken from balance-
sheet figures, which require some adjust-
ments for comparative purposes. In
each case the main asset is a holding of
ords. in G.U.T. Pty., but these are taken
into the books by Greater J, D. Williams
at about twice the other cos.’ valuation
(70s. each, as against 365.). On a uniform
basis, Greater J. D- Williams’s share
cover would be reduced to 18s. 6d.; how-
ever, another of this co.’s assets, the
Liberty Theatre in Melbourne, is entered
very conservatively in the books.
Freehold properties raise another issue.
A condition of the Rank deal in 1946
was that three theatres now owned by
the holding cos. and leased to Greater
Union would have to be sold eventually
to the proprietary in exchange for deben-
tures bearing not more than 5 p.c.
Specific prices weren’t laid down, but
£300,000 is the most that will be paid
for all three. On the face of it, some
loss of revenue would appear to be in-
volved for the three holding cos. in
question (Greater J.D.W., West’s and
Amalgamated Pictures); the maximum re-
turn from the debentures would be
£15,000 yearly, whilst present rentals evi-
dently amount to at least £23,000.
It is hardly a mere question of inter-
company book entries. Whilst any re-
duced revenue to the holding cos. would
represent a saving to G.U.T. Pty., the
higher earnings of this subsidiary would
not be redistributed on a fully com-
pensating basis (half its earnings belong
to Rank’s).
Spencer’s is the only holding co. un-
affected by this issue, as it owns no
theatres. The involved histories of mem-
bers of the Greater Union group present
the board with some complex accounting
problems, and the'general advantages of
the Rank deal to the Australian cos. are
not being called in question. But it is
very desirable that investors should be

given a clearer picture than they
now have of the relative future
earning abilities of the four
companies.
Allowing for an adjustment of
£419,000 in respect of War-time
(Co.) Tax, B.H. South, in a pre-
liminary announcement, claims
a profit of £916,246 (down
£152,934), or 114.2 p.c. on capi-
tal, for the year to end June last.
That was after setting aside an
extra £66,000 for taxation
(£436,000), but £7230 less for
royalties (£156,000). Contrac-
tion in the profit figure was due
to drop in metal content of con-
centrates produced and steep
rise in costs. Average price re-
ceived for metals exported rose
over the twelvemonth by about
£AIO a ton for both lead and
zinc. An interim div. of Is. 6d.
a share went out in June. The
final, to be announced at the
annual meeting this month, will
be paid in December. Distribu-
tions from 1946-47 earnings
totalled ss. 3d. a share, of which
2s. was paid as a special bonus
from the tax recovery already
referred to. The market prices
the f.-p. ss. shares at 51s, as
against 435. 10 months ago.

Queensland Education Minis-
ter Bruce, on a recent visit to
N.Q., was outspoken about high
taxation retarding tinmining. He
instanced Morris Bros., of Elaine
Mary tinmine, Watsonville, say-
ing they were unable to produce
owing to the crippling effect of
taxation. A recent crushing of
35i tons from F. G. Byrne,
Great Southern mine, Irvine-
bank, yielded eiglit tons four
cwt. tin concentrate, valued at
£3069. Still, this party advised
the Herberton warden that “they
cannot treat any more ore this
financial year as it would be
economically unsound to do so
on account of heavy taxation.”
It is a sorry paradox when high
prices entail lower production.
Mr. Chifley should discard his
pipe with its smokescreen and
face facts as normal people do.

High costs (61.25. a ton last
term), aggravated by a major
breakdown of one of the co.’s
two diesel engines, have
strangled Triton (W.A.), which
has now ceased mining and is
having an independent valuation
of plant and buildings made.
For year to end March last co,
recorded a loss of £49,803 on
treatment of 68,288 tons of
6.42dwt. ore, with a 91.3 p.c.
recovery. When the books
closed there was £73,593 com-
ing to the Commonwealth Bank,
£39,078 to Gold Exploration
and Finance and £7920 to
sundry creditors ; total £120,590.
Plant stood at £240,050 (cost),
buildings £50,069 (cost), motor
vehicles and stores £23,786,
debtors, bullion and cash
£15,487. There are 37,700 tons,
averaging B.4dwt., plus 25,200
tons averaging 9.ldwt, in the pil-
lars, of extractable ore in the
mine. Paid capital is £480,000
in 10s. shares. Since commence-
ment in 1935 co. has paid divs,
totalling £264,000.

How taxation is steadily
strangling incentive in the gold-
mining industry is clearly illus-
trated in the case of London-
controlled Sons of Gwalia,
operating on the North Cool-
gardie field (W.A.). Here are the
co.’s aggregate profit, tax and
dividend figures for each of the
last two decades: —•

SUNDRY SHOWS
SPAIN IN SYDNEY.
Against the background of a
dingy black curtain and the
towering intestines of the Town
Hall organ, La Joselito continues
to submit to Sydney audiences
the dances of Spanish peasants
and gypsies.
Everything is wrong about the
performance except the dancer
and her accompanists on piano
and guitar. The hall’s glaring
top-lights beat down and blind
the audience and make the stage
commonplace; only in one
gypsy dance, where Joselito ap-
parently burns with unrequited
passion and stabs herself with a
castanet, was a spotlight used
with any dramatic effect.
Two Town Hall assistants—
respectable, solemn, obliging
men, whom one felt an almost
irresistible impulse to clap—
stride on to the stage from time
to time and push a grand piano
to and fro. An undistinguished
kitchen chair, intended for the
distinguished repose of the
guitarist, Juan Relampago, is
left forlornly on the platform
or, occasionally, is waved
vaguely in the air by the
guitarist, who obviously feels it
is not his job to dispose of it.
Through all these disad-
vantages Joselito dances not
merely unperturbed but with
flashing vitality. She sways
about in a high hat and a long,
straight dress and makes one
yearn to be a bachelor again.
She turns herself into a simple,
deliberately clumsy peasant girl,
and fills the hall with laughter.
She, snaps her castanets with in-
credible skill and snaps her
fingers even more incredibly. She
runs on in a dozen different cos-
tumes, all colorful and beauti-
ful, and dances an equally color-
ful dance for each.
She sings sometimes as she
dances, in a low, husky voice
rather like the deeper notes of
the guitar. She stands ap-
parently stockstill and kicks her
heels on the stage with a sound
like a roll of drums that makes
a joke of mere tap-dancing. De-
lighted with her own prowess,
she yelps like a wolf and, with
eyes and teeth flashing and heels
drumming, rumbles across the
stage like a small dark thunder-
bolt : like Iser rolling rapidly.
Nothing can make the Town
Hall smell of garlic; nothing
can persuade one that there are
goats and donkeys instead of
automobiles parked outside in
George-street. One can never
imagine that the two Town Hall
assistants will fall upon each
other with knives. The pipe-
organ refuses to look like an
olive-tree. The performance
should be seen at the Theatre
Royal with full orchestra, with
scenery and proper lighting ; or
in the intimacy of a night club ;
or, best of all, in Spain. At the
Town Hall it remains academic,
not quite real; but charming,
nevertheless, exotic, very skil-
ful and altogether unusual.
"Rigoletto."
Though an early work, with a
libretto that almost defies de-
scription, “Rigoletto” is one of
Verdi’s most distinguished
operas. He seems to have
poured more of his own experi-
ence into the part of the hump-
backed jester than any other
character he handled. One
of the most sustained pieces of
musical characterisation in all
drama, it was given a distin-
guished hearing at Melbourne
His Majesty’s.
The role of the hunchbacked
jester who conspires for his own
undoing and the seduction of his
daughter requires an actor and
a singer who can dominate in
both departments. When Mario
Basiola ordered the proud
courtiers from the ducal cham-
ber so that he could lament in
isolation over his daughter’s
ruin, he carried conviction, and
the nobility slunk off like guilty
children.
Basiola even made the some-
what comic incident of the Body
in the Bag convincing, which is
saying something. It required
a strong effort of imagination to
conceive the deformed creature
picking up the well-nourished
form of Alvino Misciano, as the
profligate duke, and staggering
off with the package on his
shoulder to hurl it into a river,
but when the bag awoke and the
fair form of Rina Mariosa, none
the worse for wear and in good
voice, sat up and uttered her
death-rattle in perfect unison
with her father’s deep-throated
maledictions, there was hardly
a dry eye anywhere in the house,
such was the emotional sincerity
of Basiola’s acting.
Misciano was a more-than-
sufficient explanation for the
duke’s numerous amours, and he
mercifully spared the audience
the cadenzas other singers have
introduced into “Donna e
mobile” without the composer’s
sanction. Wilma Whitney acted
with vigor and sang melodiously
as Maddelena, but sang in Eng-
lish with the curious result that
she made the" music sound
momentarily more like Gilbert
and Sullivan than Verdi. Augus-
to Romani’s Sparafucile was not
a very convincing hired assassin,
but Plinio Clabassi was an effi-
cient instrument for the curse
of Count Monterone. The dress-
ing was resplendent.
Klecki.
Paul Klecki, the Polish con-
ductor with the leonine head,
bathed the first half of the eighth
“celebrity” concert at Melbourne
Town Hall in a cool flood of
Mozart, the highlight of which
was the Pianoforte Concerto No.
23 in A major, with Jascha
Spivakovsky at the piano. The
Melbourne musician gave his
usual competent performance
and touched brilliance in the
beautiful andante, which is one
of the composer’s finest
moments.
Mahler’s Symphony No. 1 in
D major occupied the second
half of the programme. Mahler,
according to his own statement,
was a sworn foe of “programme
notes”—“Down with programme
notes. They propagate false
ideas,” he once shouted at a
supper-party. Which is no
doubt why A.B.C. provided his
work, played for the first time
in Australia, with three closely-
printed pages. The symphony
was soft, sweet and extraordi-
narily rich in texture —almost
unctuous in places, merry in
others and sometimes meditative.
Whether the menagerie of cats,
frogs, crows, deer, foxes, coffins
and other natural objects men-
tioned in the programme were
there or not can be left to the
commentators.
Klecki reduced his audience to
such a state of hypnosis during
the raging vehemence of the
finale that it forgot to make its
usual dumb-cattle rush for the
exits at the finish. The con-
ductor was recalled so many
times that he nearly wagged his
head off.
"Romeo and Juliet."
The Melbourne National
Theatre’s corps of actors were
elegantly costumed, their diction
was wellnigh perfect and Capu-
let’s hall and Juliet’s chamber
were admirably upholstered for
“Romeo and Juliet.” But, with
the exception of Paul Maloney’s
Mercutio, the amount of feeling
put into the performance
wouldn’t have ferried the cast
across a fishpond. Reg Gillam
behaved more like a bewildered
curate than the scion of a clan
at bitter enmity with another
and whose obsession for the
daughter of his hated rival turns
him into a raving madman.
The performance of Anthony
Doogood as his father might
easily have been taken for the
burlesque of a boy at his first
school break-up. Gordon Lee-
der Tybalt’s hotheadedness was
mainly verbal, though he rose to
the occasion in his duel with
Paul Maloney, who took the
count in a very realistic fashion.
Gloria Mellody’s Juliet was all
sweetness, though in the play she
becomes a clever schemer. June
Browne made the bawdiness of
the nurse convincing, but nodded
her head throughout as if she
had the palsy.
The same cast does much
better in contemporary drama,
probably because it can feel it.
Artbursts.
Judged by the exhibition of
his work at George’s Gallery,
Melbourne, English sculptor
Clifford Last belongs to
the modern school which be-
lieves that new forms and
materials will do the job for
them. Mr. Last has carved his
madonnas, saints, penguins and
prophets in elm, chestnut, lam-
bertiana, cedar-pine, pearwood,
mahogany, alabaster, cement and
jarrah, all very bright and shiny. •
One of his subjects is carved in
a piece of driftwood found on
the beach at St. Kilda. His
forms are equally exotic. Un-
fortunately, what they all lack is
observation, and when he does
a straight bit of modelling, as
in “Sue” and “Portrait Study,”
the quality of his line Is com-
monplace.
* * * *
“F.S.”: Melbourne Con-
temporary Artists’ 1948 exhibi-
tion at the Athenaeum Gallery
prompts reflections on the
validity of labels. “Contempor-
ary,” in the sense they use it,
presumably means “of the
times.” Yet the paintings of
Titian and Rembrandt don’t be-
long to any “time” —they are as
true today as they were when
they were painted. But those
painters never called themselves
“contemporary” or “modern.”
The thing they had in common
was their observation, and if, by
some chance or other, a con-
temporary developed the degree
of observation of a Rembrandt
would his pictures then be old-
fashioned? They would have
more in common with that
master than with anything hung
in the present exhibition, which

“C. 8.”: A season of ballet at
the National Theatre, Mel-
bourne, produced, amongst some
repetitions of familiar numbers,
one new example, “Judith” —
choreography by Jean Alex-
ander, decor by John Rowell
and story allegedly from an old
Javanese legend. Each year one
of the temple-dancers is chosen
by the high priest as a sacrifice,
and his choice falls on Judith.
The priestesses perform their
ritual before the altar while
Judith is preparing herself for
the sacrifice. What method the
high priest uses to dispatch
Judith to her ancestors isn’t
given in the ballet, which is a
pity. It would have added some
gaiety to the proceedings if
Judith had been boiled, baked
or fried, had her throat cut,
been buried alive, krised or
knocked on the head with a
mallet according to good old
Javanese custom. '

“Song of My Heart”: Stupid
story on the alleged love-life of
Tschaikowsky. Hollywood, run-

inevitable beautiful princess as
the composer’s benefactress.
Well, dears, isn’t that more
soothing to the bobbysoxers
than displaying his real bene-

Meek, widow of an enormously
wealthy engineer and the mother
of 12 children, who made it a
condition of the benefaction that
she and the composer never
meet —and they didn’t?

YOUR SHOUT !
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
As had happened with the best of
the spring racing in Sydney, the Caul-
field Cup meeting was conducted on a
rain-sodden track. It is always a pity
to see a good race run under imper-
fect conditions, and even more regret-
table to see the winner of a good race
greeted with such a nasty demonstra-
tion as was accorded Red Fury after
he had won the Cup on Saturday.
Of the 430-odd horses originally
nominated for the Cup, there were 24
final acceptors, and 21 actually went
to the post. In the week or so prior
to Saturday the betting order had
changed almost from hour to hour,
but it was the New Zealander, Howe,
who eventually started favorite at
4 to 1.
After a rather ragged start, in which
De La Salle suffered particularly, the
field set off for the first turn with a
strange absence of the usual mad
scrambling; most riders realised that
on the soft track the race would go
not so much to the swift as to the
horse whose energy had been best con-
served in the early stages. With none
particularly anxious to go for the lead,
such an unlikely pacemaker as Proctor
was soon left in front.
Six furlongs from home, and too
soon to please his backers, Munro was
obliged to let Howe take up the run-
ning. Approaching the three-furlongs
mark Howe led from Beau Gem while
further back Saxony, Red Fury and
De La Salle were moving up fast. In
the straight Howe appeared to have
them beaten until Red Fury initiated
an amazing finishing run, caught
Howe in the last 50yds., and, with an
advantage in the weights of 141 b.,
went on to win by one-and-a-quarter
lengths.
Proving beyond question her
thorough class, De La Salle, despite
her mishap at the start, finished on to
cut Saxony out of third money. Ex-
cuses were made and possibly were in
order. In other circumstances De La
Salle might have won, and so, for that
matter, might have Howe. Still, the
winner that will go down in the record-
books, and, incidentally, that book-
makers pay out on, is Red Fury, a
five-year-old chestnut horse by En-
field-Ravenna, trained by J. Flannery
and ridden in the Cup by W. Briscoe.
Red Fury started at 16 to 1.
At his previous start, on the same
course, over the same distance, on a
similarly soft track, but against a
weaker field, he had started favorite
and finished eighth in a field ot iz in
the Herbert Power Handicap won by
Howe.
About all that could be said in
favor of the performance of Sydney
visitor Wattle, odds-on favorite for
the One Thousand Guineas, was that
it may have been too bad to be true.
Wattle obviously didn’t like the re-
verse way of running, hung out badly
at the turns, and finally faded right
out of the race. Withstanding a
strong challenge from the Nizami filly
Novam, second favorite Siren Song
(E. Clarke) took the Guineas, bringing
her recent record to four wins in a
row. Blessing finished on well for
third money and lolanda came from
a long way back to be fourth. Unless
Wattle shows remarkable improvement
the Oaks should go to one of the four
first past the post in the Guineas.
Though speed is not her long suit,
lolanda will be finishing on at the end
of 12 furlongs when many others will
have had enough.
Some of the Derby colts had a run
in the mile Burwood Handicap, but,
in a thrilling finish with only a neck
between the first five, the colts were
beaten by the Foxbridge gelding
Ellerslie, himself ineligible for the
Derby. Vagabond was second, beaten
a head; a similar distance back Comic
Court and Sun Blast deadheated for
third, and Brother Sunshine finished
only a half-neck behind them. Sun
Blast had been favorite.
Punters fared little better in other
races. Odds-on favorite Wingflyer
was beaten decisively by the St.
Magnus colt Patron (W. Bevis) in the
Gwyn Nursery. Solvive, another
favorite, went down to Beau John,
another second-favorite, in the
Moonga Handicap. And the outsider
Balkan League (J. Kennedy), paying
just under £23 for five shillings each
way on the tote, led all the way _to
win the Wyuna Steeple from Ration
and Priority after seven of the 14-
runners had come to grief.
* * * *
The fates that be must have de-
cided that Sydney racegoers had had
about enough punishment for the
present, after the disastrous Spring
meeting. The weather for City Tatter-
sail’s Club’s Gold Cup meeting on
Saturday was perfect, and results or
the six races very much favored the
punter.
Riding honors at Randwick were
shared by G. Moore and N. Sellwood,
Moore taking the Youthful Stakes on
Grand Applause and the Three-year-
old on Cragside, while Sellwood
landed a double for the McCarten
stable in winning the Gold Cup (12f.)
with Lysander and the Club Welter
with Keewatin. Actually the Sell-
wood-McCarten combination went
within an inch of taking half the
programme, the Dhoti filly Vicereine,
heavily backed first-up, being beaten
only a nose by Grand Applause in
the Youthful Stakes. Vicereine battled
it out with the colt from start to finish
and looks one to keep in mind.
Lysander, a four-year-old full-brother
to Shannon, has cost punters a pretty
penny over recent weeks, but made
amends by just scraping home ahead
of Silver Link in the main event, for
which he had started favorite at 3 to
1; Flying Duke finished third. Burly-
looking old Silver Link has a heart-
breaking record of minor placings in
good races —among them a Melbourne
Cup second.
While The Groom (E. Fordyce) was
an impressive winner of the George
Herdsman Stakes (6f.), the efforts of
the minor-placegetters Smooth Action
and Cadet also took the eye. Nearly
last as they turned for home, Smooth
Action rattled home in great style to
be beaten by a long neck. The speedy
Nuffield colt Cadet was handy all the
way and should be capable of winning
something easier over the same dis-
tance.
Punters might do a lot worse than
stick to three-year-olds for the re-
mainder of this season, particularly in
restricted events. Right from the be-
ginning of the season the younger
horses have been winning more than
their share of Mixed Stakes and
similar races, and should continue to
do so. Three-year-olds filled the
places in Saturday’s Novice Handicap
(10f.), Lordly (A. Ward) winning from
Royal Show (a coming winner) and
Sir Falcon.

No doubt inspired by recent racing
news from these parts, the Hokkaido
Veterinarians Association, according
to a report from Tokyo, has con-
cocted a fearsome-sounding formula
“to make racehorses run faster.” It
comprises “powdered herring mixed
with flour and the malt of sweet-
potato tendrils, phosphate lime and
carbonate lime.” There is no truth in
the rumor that all runners engaged
at Randwick in future will be sub-
mitted to a halitosis test.

Melbourne publican J. P s Bachli
landed a fair sort of double on Satur-
day. At Caulfield his two-year-old
colt Patron won the Gwyn Nursery,
and, at Metropolitan golf course,
another good colt in his 26-year-old
son Doug Bachli won the Australian
Amateur Golf Championship. Mainly
through brilliant putting Bachli beat

Whatever strange lure there is in
the prospect of blazing away at a
distant target attracted over 600
marksmen (and markswomen) to the
Anzac Rifle Range, Sydney, last week
for The King’s Prize shoot. Com-
petitors represented every walk of life
and all ages from 16 to 70-odd; the
winner was a 36-year-old beekeeper,
Colin Campbell, of Mudgee. At the
final stage of 900yds. Campbell needed
a 47 to win; disdaining the allowable
45sec. between shots, he sent them off
at 20sec. intervals to sebre 48 and
collect the £lOO prize.

The first fine Saturday this season
helped Sydney grade cricket to finish
on time. Cumberland XI —which
since the premiership was launched in
1893 has had only two wins (1899-
1900 and 1932-33)—scored a good win
over Manly, and is now the only team
that has won in all three rounds so far
played. Ron James, late of S.A.,
helped the side to victory with 119 in
a tally of 288. W. South (Randwick)
was the only other century-maker with
105 v. Mosman; but the hurricane
hitting that pleased the crowd was
Derek Mendl’s 95 in 65 mins, for
Gordon v. Northern Districts; his
knock included nine sixers and seven
fours. Topnotch bowling efforts were
those of R. Hill (Wests), seven for
,32; V. Emery (N. Syd.), six for 40;
and C. Graham (Glebe), six for 47.

Always the finest of sportsmen, Don
Bradman simply wouldn’t know how
to miss doing “the right thing.” His
final appearance in first-class cricket is
not to be in his own testimonial
match, as was originally mooted, but
in the later Sydney testimonial for a
couple of old mates in Oldfield and
Kippax. The Bradman name and the
circumstances will add hundreds to
the value of the gate.
The Oldfield-Kippax testimonial will
be the final testing of candidates for
the team to tour S’Africa. A word
from the selectors that hurry-up
“If the weather doesn't get too hot I should make a
packet out of this one."
methods will enhance players’ pros-
pects of a holiday with the Springboks
would be the very making of coming
Sheffield Shield and other first-class
matches. Without that word, caution
will be the keynote, and dull the spec-
tators’ lot.

After being walloped in two
matches last week the touring Kan-
garoo League team downed the strong
Dewsbury XIII on Saturday by 14-4.
In the turmoil the Australians kept up
the punching habit, and, “after a
brawl,’’ as one paper reported, husky
J. Holland got his name added to the
growing list of “ordered-offs” since
the team landed in England.
* * *
The weights of Ted Sprouster and
Nipper O’Brien, for their Leichhardt
clash, were officially given as 9.1 and
9.3 respectively. If true, O’Brien must
be the original boy with hollow legs;
inches taller and bigger all round he
looked a good 101 b. heavier than the
State fedder champ. Certainly the
difference proved too much for
Sprouster, who was well beaten on
points.

Setback?
Wheat has fallen sharply in
the world’s chief grain markets,
and Sydney wool sales have
been at a lower level than last
year. These two items are of
vital importance in Australia’s
export income. Metals con-
tinue to rise in price, on the
other hand, and from lead and
spelter the Commonwealth
draws important overseas
revenue. Dairy produce, too, is
bringing a higher sterling price
to us.
Last year’s inflated national
income was partly a result of
high prices for our export pro-
duce, partly due to inflated costs
and money figures generally.
It was the huge bulk of it
which enabled Mr, Chifley to
cut such a large taxation slice
from the national economy, and
it is on the size of this slice that
he has based much of his Budget
planning for the year now
current.
On present indications it is
unlikely that expansion in the
national income will continue
during 1948-49 at the rate seen
in 1947-48. There may even be
a levelling-off over the next half-
year—especially if any adjust-
ment should occur in the ex-
change rate.
The abolition of price subsi-
dies by the Federal Govern-
ment, too, has raised threats of
increased competition in the
market for knitted woollen
goods. Jumpers, cardigans, etc.,
made in Australia are now
being undercut, in some cases,
by British goods. The same
sort of thing may happen in the
felt-hat trade before long, and
no doubt there will be many
other instances of harder com-
petition from the sterling and
soft-currency import areas.
There are quite a number of
commercial and economic de-
velopments at the present time
that suggest an ending, in some
respects, of the “economics of
scarcity” which have been a
trading feature for the past seven
or eight years. Coupled with
the Communist stranglehold on
coal production, steel output and
output per man-hour generally,
and the extravagant misuse of
taxpayers’ money by “Labor”
at Canberra, the effects of the
change to more competitive mar-
kets might prove a shock to
Australian industry. Coastal
shipping companies are losing
money heavily because of high
costs, slow turn-round of ves-
sels and other difficulties that
have arisen during “Labor’s”
term of office.
Whatever reverses are ahead
of Australian industry there are
few that cannot be countered by
harder work and a more
rational and co-operative ap-
proach to the national problem.
This means, for a start, the out-
lawing of Communist treachery.
There is a vast demand await-
ing the output from Australian
essential industries, and the
partial fulfilment of that de-
mand will create a big secondary
demand. Australia’s chief
menace today is not from any
fall in overseas price-levels; it
is from the studied obstruction
of our production efforts in
order to keep costs up and
output down, and from the
hindrance of our production
energies in a multitude of ways
by Canberra “Labor.”
MaorilancTs Labor Daily
Can Maoriland’s Labor daily,
the “Southern Cross,” hold on
long enough to share in the big
fight next year, when the Labor
party will need all its guns to
win the general election? At
the rate it has been slipping
back over the past couple of
years another 12 months looks
a long time. On the average,
close on £lOOO a week appears
to have gone down the drain —
£98,309 of the £163,169 capital
put up by Labor unions and
organisations, among others, was
lost to the end of December
last,, the, co, owed the State-
owned Bank of New Zealand
£28,913, and current liabilities
of £58,767 were only £66 short
of swallowing up liquid assets of
£58,833. Opposition Parliamen-
tarians want to know whether
the B.N.Z. is following a “pru-
dent policy” in financing
“hazardous business ventures,”
among which they rank Labor’s
newspaper enterprise. There
must be many more credit-
worthy borrowers who are re-
fused bank accommodation in
these days of tight credit-control.
Will Labor put the hat around
again among the unions in a
desperate effort to keep the ship
afloat? Its directorate, all lead-
ing Labor-party officials, is the
largest of any Maoriland news-
paper, and probably of any com-
pany, but only two claim print-
ing and publishing experience.
The Australian export price of
wheat has been reduced by ss. a
bushel, from 20s. 6d, to 15s. 6d. —
a drop of nearly 25 p.c. The
United States has had the
largest grain harvest in history
(wheat second only to 1947),
and Canada’s was very heavy;
the European crop, too, was
within 15 p.c. of pre-war aver-
age. There is no world-wide
overproduction, but output is
drawing closer to world demand.
The Australian harvest for 1948-
49 will be below the high figure
for 1947-48, and, with prices
down, the Commonwealth’s
wheat cheque—a record last
year will be considerably
lower. “Stabilisation” is unlikely
to help the grower’s pocket at
this stage, The coming drop in
the national wheat cheque will
be the first thing of its kind in
this country since the end of the
war. It is likely to be accom-
panied by a reduced wool turn-
over ; prices, though firming
now, are still down 10 p.c. to
15 p.c. on 1947-48 closing rates.
* * * *
Reports from the United
States reveal a tendency for in-
fl ati n g prices to level-off.
Cheaper prices for farm pro-
ducts, started by the fall in grain
quotations, are working through
the whole price-structure, com-
mencing with food costs. And
prices of some manufactured
goods are weakening because
supply has caught up with de-
mand. Cotton-goods, clothing
and shoes are examples, while
electrical appliances have notice-
ably declined in price also. The
National City Bank of New
York comments: “The price-
softening is concentrated in
areas where the rise has been
greatest, and where readjustment
will benefit more people than it
hurts. Farmers will have more
to sell, and will have a corre-
spondingly good income even at
lower prices. The signs of re-
adjustment are spotty, not
general. Deferred demand is far
from exhausted in many lines,
including the metals, automo-
biles and many types of capital
equipment, and the position in
all these lines is still immensely
strong. People and business
are far less extended financially
than at previous times when
booms have given way to de-
pressions.” In Australia’s case
our chief present problem is a
production depression accom-
panied by monetary inflation.

ordinary, including 23,052 shares

LONDON AIRMAIL
From Herbert Holman
The Big City
If the fickle English climate
has a reputation that is past re-
demption, it may fairly be said
that there is one season which
regularly strives to make amends.
Early autumn, like a man in the
full prime of life, is mature,
settled and consistently free from
changeability. After a poor
summer Londoners are enjoying
an unbroken spell of good
weather.
St. James’s Park is bordered
with pink and mauve asters and
Michaelmas daisies and banked
with many-colored dahlias. The
trees have not yet lost their
greenness, although a few faded
leaves are scattered over
the ground. Office-workers,
eager to enjoy a belated spell of
mild weather, take sandwiches
into the park and recline on the
grass. The packed lunch is due
less to economy than to con-
venience, for it is impossible
to get a restaurant meal without
a long wait.
Oversea visitors commonly re-
mark that the people about
London’s streets seem haggard
and tired, as if they were still
living under a heavy strain. To
return from a short holiday at a
South Coast resort (which is
near enough to London to have
business trains) seems like step-
ping from one country into an-
other. Life in this coastal town
is brisk and by no means lazy,
and food is not so much more
plentiful as to make any material
difference. Yet the people seem
fresh, unharassed and markedly
courteous. The explanation
would seem to rest in the fact
that the metropolis is much too
big; the growing millions of
Greater London impose too
great a strain upon administra-
tion, distribution and transport
services. Doctors in the outer
suburbs are concerned about the
effect which rush-hour travel has
upon the nerves, particularly of
young people.
Conservative Conference
An examination of the 178
resolutions tabled for the 69th
conference (at Llandudno) of the
National Union of Conservative
and Unionist Associations shows
how much the Conservative
party depends upon the support
of people from all walks of life.
This fact is perhaps clearer to
members of the party than it is to
the general public, to whom the
force and, indeed, the evidence
of Conservative policy have
not yet been driven home. Dele-
gates are so concerned about this
lack of understanding that their
party is everybody’s party that
they have 11 resolutions urging
wider publicity and specialised
campaigning.
In general, the theme common
to all items is co-partnership and
profit-sharing. The agricultural
and industrial charters are to
have special attention, the
former being due for approval.
It is stressed. that the farm-
worker must have the oppor-
tunity for advancement as a
result of his own enterprise and
skill. With industrial relations,
much concern is expressed at the
Socialist hold on the trade-
unions, which, it is affirmed,
should be non-political. Indeed,
one resolution calls for amend-
ment of the Trades Union Act
so that trade-unionists shah
not pay a political levy unless
they have “contracted-in.” It is
also recommended that the
present penal rate of taxation be
reduced.
Of Parliamentary candidates,
as well as resolutions calling for
“men and women of character,
ability and sound political know-
ledge and from all walks of life,”
and for the exclusion of the
elderly candidate with little poli-
tical experience, another de-
mands that the best possible men
and women should be chosen to
contest marginal seats. The man
of moderate income is no longer
at a disadvantage. By a new
rule the entire election expenses
of candidates are the responsi-
bility of the constituency associa-
tions. He may not pay an annual
subscription to the party of more
than £25; and, if he is elected,
of more than £5O.
Imperial policy attracts 12
resolutions —the largest number
devoted to a single subject. Im-
perial preference is stressed, and
it is urged that the Conservative
party, in consultation with those
of like mind within the Empire,
should point the way towards
a new conception of Common-
wealth relations.
Fifth-column
Following a resolution at last
year’s conference, a Conservative
sub-committee, under the chair-
manship of Mr. Henry Strauss,
K.C., M.P., was appointed to
study Communist, Fascist and
other subversive organisations.
The committee reports that
Mosley’s Fascists do not con-
stitute a serious threat. Existing
laws can deal with them, and
their activities are well enough
known to the Government and
to the Socialist party.
The report has blunt words to
say about Communism. The
danger is “near and great.”
Ignorance is widespread, among
Conservatives as well as else-
where. While the Communist
party claims to be regarded as a
legal political organisation, it
“demands the privileges of the
democratic institutions it seeks
to destroy.” It is “part of the
machinery of international con-
spiracy, operating on a directive
issued to it by Moscow.”
The committee recommends
that Conservative trade-unionists
take an active part in union
affairs and Conservative women
in the Co-operative movement.
“Outside criticism,” it declares,
“is of little value; inside action
is vital.” Socialism has proved,
in other European countries, to
have been Communism’s “door-
opener and then its doormat”;
and, by preaching class-war, has
“created the condition upon
which Communism thrives.”
Both in the “Daily Worker”
and in the pressing of some
wage-claims there have lately
been unmistakeable signs of a
Communist “offensive,” to which
attention was immediately drawn
by the press, including the
“Times” and the Manchester
“Guardian.” At the same time,
announcements of a rearmament
programme, with all its implica-
tions have caused widespread, if
temporary, anxiety. Lack of
clarity in Government statements
and soft words from Mr. Shin-
well aggravate rather than allay.
Britons are not unused to danger,
and they have learned that the
danger least to be feared is that
which is known and clear. The
public should be told, preferably
in Churchillian phrase. Further
enlightenment on Communism
may not then be necessary.
Australia and Us £
The “Australia and You” ex-
hibition, which is being held near
Piccadilly Circus, has been so
successful that it is to be ex-
tended by 14 days to October 23.
Few exhibits can be contained
within the space of a single
room, and even with a small
movie-projector working con-
tinuously nothing more than the
merest hint of life in the Com-
monwealth can be given. But a
daily average of some 1000
persons has visited the exhibi-
tion ; of these, it is estimated
that three out of four have
inquired about migration. These,
according to an official, are not
just anxious to escape, but sin-
cerely believe Australia to be a
land of opportunity, where they
can recreate a new life in their
own, the British, way. The
Malan Government’s restrictions
on immigration to South Africa
have undoubtedly caused an in-
crease in the number of
inquiries.


ARORIGINALITIES
“Little iEsop”: When a flock of galahs
was shot into near Quorn (S.A.) one fell
at the feet of the marksman, who, seeing
it flutter, raised a stick to kill it. His hand
was stayed by the galah greeting him with
“Hello, boy!” He took the bird to his
car, where, after a brief rest and further
conversation, it flew off to rejoin its
comrades. The point is: Was it the only
talking bird of the bunch, or have they
all learnt to speak the language as a
form of protection should they make a
forced landing in the presence of the
enemy?
* * * ♦
“Nor’-west”: That wreck lying sub-
merged in a natural hide-out on Bernier
Island spoken of by “G’snatcher” (B.
22/9/’4B) was often mentioned by the
late E. H. Angelo, a Westralian M.P. An
even stranger story came one time from
Yardi Creek, an odd-shaped inlet that
runs a couple of miles into the peninsula
forming the westward side of Exmouth
Gulf (W.A.), In the 1890’s, when the
first homestead of what is now Yanrey
station was being built, sinkings made to
take the foundation-stumps struck the
oaken timbers of a buried ship. How a
sizeable ship—judging by the weight of
the timbers —came to be buried a couple
of hundred yards from the beach was a
problem never solved, nor, indeed, in-
vestigated because the work of building
the house and finding water for stock
was too urgent. Possibly the shoreline
had grown outwards in the course of
centuries. The best guess is that the
wreck was the Ridderschap van Holland,
a vessel long overdue at Batavia. The
search for it brought William Vlaming
and his under-captains so far south that
they discovered and named Rottnest
Island and the Swan River. Probably
the wreck is still untouched and only
needs some shovelwork to uncover a
treasure of silver guilders.
“M.W.H.”: That 24ft. squid found
near Sydney and the statement that it is
of the type given to dragging boats under
water reminded me of an affair off
Lockhart River a few years back. A
fishing lugger had just come in with a
big shark tied to the rigging, and, after
dropping anchor, the colored crew pulled
ashore to visit the mission station.
They’d just got to the beach when some-
one noticed that the lugger was swinging
violently to one side. Suddenly it
careened almost to the water’s edge, then
righted itself. Inspection showed that the
shark had gone, and there were curious
markings about the deck which led the
boys to exclaim “Ah, that fella big squid
been along here.” They claimed there
were big specimens that flung their ten-
tacles over their prey and dragged it
under. We dismissed it as a blackfellow
yam at the time.
* * # *
“W.P.T.”: In some creeks on the
N.S.W. South Coast the platypuses seem
to be increasing again, probably because
the poison-cart no longer lays pollard
baits for rabbits. Baits were laid fairly
close to creeks, and it was not uncommon
to see a dozen platypuses poisoned in One
night.
* * * *
“Kerin Paul”: Goannas, like snakes,
don’t masticate. Disturbed one once
from siesta in a low single-exit hollow
at Tchum Lake, near Birchip (Vic.).
After sprinting the first few yards he
slowed to a stumbling waddle. I “hotly
pursued” —a good 10 yards behind. He
stopped and half-turned to meet me, and,
as he Was almost as big as a crocodile
and I had bare feet, anyway, I stopped,
too. With one full-length convulsion he
vomited and ran on unhindered, leaving
behind a week-old rabbit kitten drenched
with saliva but otherwise intact. By-
passing several bulloaks, he hit the water
and splashed through a depth of six
inches for about eight yards to a red-
gum, scaled its trunk and entered a hol-
low 20ft. up. I’ve often wondered
whether he expected the water to deter
pursuit or whether he knew that the red-
gum had the nearest hollow hiding-place,

“Balander”: Where are all those
Aboliars with their big Murray cod 7
Buddy Saranealis was fishing off the pier
at Thursday Island the other week when
something fastened on to the hook and set
out to tow both fisherman and jetty into
the Coral Sea. Luckily the hook
straightened out, and Strait geography
remained static. A few days later Buddy
had his line in again, and once more the
hook was captured by what felt like
a modem U-boat. This time the
fisherman was ready and played his catch,
landing an 86in. groper, with a girth of
58in., that turned the scales at 4501 b. In
its mouth was the long scar which Buddy n
rightly or wrongly, holds was put theie
by his first hook. The thing is claimed to
be a record.

“Bullyoke”; Rosevale Station, out near
Julia Creek (C.Q.), expects to run 18-
footer yacht races after the next rains.
The station now has a 67,000 cubic-yard
tank, 50ft. deep, put down by M. D.
Burns, a tank-sinker of those parts
who reckons he has the biggest tank-
sinking plant south of the line. Around
Julia Creek and Winton Burns has put
down tanks aggregating 330,000 cubic
yards, and he cautiously admits that the
“Westerners are becoming water-con-
scious.” It’s alleged that when somebody
asked Magoffin, owner of Rosevale, what
would happen to the hole if it didn’t rain,
he replied that it would be cut up into
postholes and sold to the Hanlon Gov-
ernment for the dingo-proof fences it has
promised to build.

“Kerin Paul”: What is a “ ’roo-dog,”
anyway (B. 29/9/’48)? In our mulga
town as kids we had plenty of them, but
no two were alike, each showing a few
characteristics of various breeds —grey-
hound, staghound, whippet, kelpie, heeler,
collie and even Airedale. But we proudly
announced any fair-sized tyke as “a real
genuine kangaroo-dog.”
* * * *
“K.A.8.”: From the comparative
comfort of their trucks on the siding at
Flemington (N.S.W.) saleyards the cattle
peered pityingly at the human freight
jammed in a passenger-train slowing down
at the station. Before the brakes had
finished screeching the struggle was on —
of four people struggling to board for
every one that got off. But the first
elbow-jolt had not been delivered when
two kelpies slipped through the forest
of legs and vanished into the interior
like snakes through rushes. Doubtless
from humane motives one man tried,
with a discouraging foot, to push the red
dog back to the platform. It would have
been easier to snatch up a drop of
mercury. I was toying with the idea of
giving the strays a home when I reached
my stop, but both dogs were off the train
and working through the crowd around
the ticket-barrier before I reached the
outskirts. A week later, on the same
train, the same dogs repeated the per-
formance. Curious, I waited outside the
barrier. The dogs wriggled through the
crush, moved out of the way, and waited.
Presently a tall, elderly man came through
the barrier gates and both kelpies im-
mediately came “to heel” and the trio
went their way. I caught up with the
old chap, and he told me about it: “When
I first got this job at the saleyards I
used to buy tickets for me dorgs. Then
one day a ticket-snatcher came through.
Well, if he didn’t perform! All dogs
had to be on a leash, they had to be
muzzled and they had to travel in the
guard’s-van (and these trains don’t have
one). So I thought it would be easier
“It’s only until they fix the mixer, boys.”
to train me dorgs to get on the train
and kid they don’t know me.” That’s
what I call training sheep-dogs.
* * * *
“Eureka”: Anyone tried eels for
weather prophets? Normally the
wrigglers move slowly about, close to the
bottom of the creek, but when they swim
rapidly near the surface it’s a sure sign
of wet weather. They seem to know
that Tain washes down insects and other
fresh food from the banks.
* ♦ * ♦
“Hanko”: I haven’t met “Gravel-
snatcher’s” bobtail goanna (B. 29/9/’4B),
but the heavyweight lizard of our Eastern
States can scarp over the hundred yards
in around 12 seconds. Probably a cake-
fed Peke could overhaul one, as a mate
of mine did along the sou’-west line
(Riverina, N.S.W.), and that was a big
go. as gos go. It measured 7ft. 4in.
from snout to tail-tip. We had plenty of
time to tape it because it swerved off the
firebreak along which my cobber was
coursing it, and collided with the train
that puffed into action tri-weekly. It
was a stiff go. as gos go, too.
# ♦ * ♦
“Derwent”: Touching on outbreaks of
“foot-and-mouth disease,” there’s an in-
teresting theory in England that starlings
are responsible. Although it has not been
proved, observers report that the disease
always coincides with the appearance of
large numbers of starlings from abroad.
It has been proved that about 50 per cent,
of the birds are affected with gapes, and
poultry-keepers accuse them of spreading
roup.
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: I’m highly sceptical
of “Shellback’s” sandbank 200 miles
west of Fremantle (B. 22/9/’4B), although
at the same distance east of that port I
can show him a fine dry stretch; entirely
covered by mirage, which at low-tide
may yield him a rich catch if he cared
to work it with his seine net. If that
Indian Ocean sandbank existed it would
be shown on charts, as are the Ashmore
Shoals, between Timor and the Australian
coast. There’s no mistaking that stretch
of shallows, and, since it’s well known,
it’s given a wide berth by shipping.
Can’t vouch for its extent, but
it seemed interminable to a “super-
cargo” on a schooner whose skipper
took a short-cut that went perilously
close to the shoals. A cockeyed-bob did
the rest, and for half a lifetime that ship
drove over, through, and past white-
capped reefs. When the cyclone blew
itself out the crew made a landfall some
300 miles past Wyndham, and, looking
back, no one could remember just when
or where they were clear of the shoals.
Back in Broome the “supercargo” sought
out his skipper for verification of his
story. But the skipper merely smiled.
He knew better than to try to convince
a crowd of pearlers that he’d negotiated
the Ashmore Shoals in a cyclone.
* * * *
“Chuck”: We were on our way for the
cow one morning when old Ringer
spotted a bunny and, with more en-
thusiasm than speed, scooted it into a
hole under some logs. There seemed
only the one stray in residence, and there-
after it became part of the mong’s morn-
ing ritual to send him speeding for cover.
As the bunny grew he ventured further
afield, but always managed to beat Ringer
by a whisker. Reaching grown size he
developed a sporting instinct and made a
practice of waiting till the dog was with-
in reasonable distance before taking off.
Then, one morning, the boss’s mong
decided to come, too. Nearing the usual
coursing-ground Ringer left the chase to
the new dog and, dashing across the pad-
dock in a wide arc, waited at the hole
under the logs. A few seconds and he
nipped up the quarry and landed it back
to me with a great show of triumph. The
old dog never was a killer. The boss’d
blow my head off if he’d seen what hap-
pened next, but, hang it, the little grey
bloke didn’t get a fair go. He’s much
more wary these mornings.
* * * «
“Kelms”: A Perth columnist with a
Wealth of inexperience rushed chortling
into print because a list of prizes for a
rifle-shooting competition included one of
a pair of spectacles. It’s a common fal-
lacy that marksmanship goes only with
infallible eyesight, but, although ability
to see the target is necessary for a run
of bulls, consistent accuracy depends on
some inherent natural faculty which all
men possess in some measure but few
to perfection. It’s a heritage from an-
cestors whose lives depended on the
accuracy of a hastily-flung stone, and it
has something in common with that won-
derful co-ordination between hand and
eye. You can point, accurately, to any-
thing you can see. To the caveman the
missile was simply the prolongation of
his arm—he could reach the object with
a stone. Your crack shot has inherited
that instinct. I was once a passenger on
a truck the driver of which peered
through thick lenses to scan the road
20 yards in front. When someone spotted
d wild turkey he pulled up, loaded his
rifle, whipped off his glasses, and dropped
the bird at 400 yards,
* * ♦ ♦
“Bughouse”: Tell “Nubis” (B.
22/9/’4B) that the question was: Does a
wreck sink to the bottom? I ventured
that a wooden ship, at a quite moderate
depth of water, encountered a density
that kept it from reaching the ocean
floor, but that an iron ship would be
crushed flat and would sink even to the
32,000 ft. deeps of the Pacific. Every iron
ship has compartments, ballast-tanks
along the keel sections protected by water-
tight bulkheads and the like, that
would, if left intact, promote suffi-
cient buoyancy to keep the ship from
sinking to the sea-bed even though it had
disappeared beneath the surface. The
initial sinking impulse of an iron ship,
however, would take it at once to
pressure-depths Where such buoyancy
mediums were crushed flat —if they were
well enough made so that the seams did
not give way first. After that it would be
a balance between the specific gravity of
iron and that of water, and even under a
30,000 ft. compression the iron would be
the heavier.
PORTRAIT.
Staunch son of hot Australian soil,
Born not to simmer but to boil,
Dauntless he stood in street or bar,
While, from beneath his sturdy mo.,
Volumes of fighting smoke he’d blow
From his fat, prosperous cigar.
With hand upon the flowing bowl,
Like cannon blasts his words would roll
Beneath his spreading Tom Mix hat;
And when he waved it, laying bare
His shining dome without a hair,
That sight alone would knock you flat.
Within the city, men would stare,
As he swung by to do and dare,
To lose a fortune, write a tale
Or with a word tear worlds to shreds
And ridicule all kingly heads
With laughter like a moderate gale.
Patriot, writer, mining man,
Something beyond the common plan,
He lived with furious energy.
His talk was of The Bulletin,
Of ores and gold and shares and sin—

“Blime”: There were two bulldozers
in town, and, after due consideration of
each, Dad engaged one for a job of dam-
sinking. “Charge sixteen quid for eight
hours,” the ’dozer bloke announced.
“Two dams you want in, don’t you?”
“Aw, no, one’ll do,” Dad told him. “And
y’ go home at nights, don’t you?” “That’s
right,” the other nodded. “Got a bike
I use for travelling. This where you
want the dam? I’ll have her in for y’ in
a coupla days. Good ’dozer, this.” Dad
showed great interest in the machine,
“Yair,” he agreed. “I’ve drove me
brother’s over in Noo South a time or
two, but this’n looks diff’rent. This lever,
now; what’s it?” Proudly the driver ex-
plained the machine, and Dad hung
round during the first afternoon watch-
ing him work and directing operations.
After that he left the chap mostly on his
own, but was on hand with the cheque
when the job cut out. “Seems a lot of
money for a couple of days,” Mum re-
marked later. “It might have been
cheaper if you’d got the bigger ’dozer,
after all.” Dad raised bloodshot eyes.
“Aw, cripes, no,” he declared wearily.
“The other had no lights. I’d never bin
able t’ put the second dam in meself with
it when the bloke went home t’ sleep.”

“Anthropo”: The aboriginal always
camped well away from his water-supply.
It was a matter of good manners to dp
so and assisted in the preservation of
peace. Tribes were divided into families,
and all families weren’t friendly—no
more than in our modern suburbia. But
the water-supply belonged to the tribe,
and everybody was supposed to have
access to it. It was the woman’s job to
get the water, and any party that camped
right on the hole was likely to cause
embarrassment to the women of another
family. The abo. woman, not being pro-
tected by a police force, was apt to read
a menace in the wandering glances of
any man other than her male relatives.
Similarly the male relatives were apt to
act up to a sort of chivalric code which
required them to throw a few spears
should their womenfolk complain of be-
ing intimidated. So it was always good
business for the peace-lover to camp well
away from the water once his needs were
satisfied. Whites were not so wise ; they
invariably camped right on the waterhole,
and native women feared to approach.
Whereupon their lords, rightly indignant
at the trespass and irritated at being kept
without a drink, would rise and cast a
few spears at the intruders. And the
war would begin.

“G’roper”: This is an authentic pre-
cedent for Unk White’s drawing of the
chap still a trifle underdone in the sweat-
box (B. 22/9/’4B). Back in the 1920’s
Perth was aware of a foreign-looking
gentleman who ran a health business, the
chief adjunct of which was a battery of
sweat-boxes, alias vapor-baths. One day
the expert was posted missing, and was
eventually found by the charlady dead in
one of his own “baths.” At the
inquest it was presumed that, arriving
early, he had decided to treat himself to
a bath but had been taken by a heart
seizure on entering the box. The corpse,
having been exposed to moist heat for
hours, was literally cooked. By a strange
coincidence, the deceased, a bachelor, had
earlier invented a sort of slow-cooker
which enabled him before leaving home
at Nedlands (W.A.) each morning to put
on any sort of stew or boil to simmer
slowly all day and be ready for tea at
night. He often demonstrated it.

“Salmon Gums”: My “notions of how
such old lags—the convicts—lived”
differ from “Colonial Cove’s” (B.
22/9/’4B). The good-conduct man who
“He’s the bottleneck in this business."
was granted ticket-of-leave was released
to work for an employer who was re-
sponsible for his custody, his keep and
the payment of his wages—usually £1 a
month. He couldn’t leave his employ-
ment without permission of both the
police and his employer, and if his work
and conduct were not entirely satisfactory
his employer could have his ticket-of-
leave rescinded. Similarly, if his employ-
ment ceased he returned to custody until
someone else applied for him. He re-
mained always the responsibility of the
Crown, and, in sickness or health, in jail
or out, he was assured of at least the
bare necessities of life. Gold exists where
“C.C.” little dreams of —the first syndi-
cated goldmine in the State was within
20 miles of Perth’s Town Hall, and many
an old lag may have found it, but refused
to trade his secret for a pardon and the
loss of his security.
*** * .
“Barney”: “Salmon Gums” (B.
6/10/’4B) has his names mixed. The
fumigant used in his rabbit-burrows
must have been carbon disulphide; not
sulphur dioxide. The dioxide is not in-
flammable, but the disulphide is. It burns
either quietly or explosively, depending
on the amount of air present. In a burrow
the air-supply is limited, and hence the
explosion. The products of combustion
include sulphur dioxide, and that has
apparently misled “Salmon Gums.” The
method is a good one, as bunny gets his
medicine three ways: The disulphide has
a rather unpleasant smell and is
poisonous; the explosion would not do
him much good; and, lastly, sulphur
dioxide has an extremely irritating odor
and is poisonous in large quantities.

“Pedant”: The argument as to whether
or not the taking of a long drink
or a heavy meal temporarily in-
creases the weight reminds me of an
argument perennial through the Middle
Ages—would the introduction of a live
fish into a vessel of water already full to
the brim cause the .water to overflow?
Savants debated it from about the time
of Roger Bacon until that of Charles 11.
The Royal Society being then formed the
Merry Monarch, who had his lucid
moments, suggested that the experiments
be tried. It was.

“Blake”; That “incensed and inquir-
ing sire” which tried the calf imitation
(B. 22/9/’4B) must have been excep-
tionally conscientious —bulls usually turn
a deaf ear to distress-signals from their
offspring. Not all cows fall for the dog
ruse, either, when trying to conceal their
calves. Some merely chase the dog round
in circles —and few hounds care to mix it
with a cow full of maternal indignation.
Other bovines just go on grazing, ap-
parently quite uninterested, while you
search for the calf, while yet others fol-
low man and dog around pretending that
the calf is just ahead and bluffing with
occasional blind rushes in all directions.
Cows always provide their calves with
early breakfast, however, and that’s the
best time to catch the young feller.

“Frenchman’s Inn”: “Kerin Paul’s”
acquaintance with brolgas in the Cressy
(Vic.) district must be very cursory. The
birds in that area are permanent residents
and not migratory. I know of at least
eight nesting spots within a comparatively
short radius of Cressy and would be
glad to show “K.P.” the nests and eggs
at any time from the middle of this
month. Some pairs, or their descendants,
have been nesting within a few yards of
the same spots for at least 25 years.
Anyone expecting to get within 100 yards
of a brolga in the open is a super-
optimist.

“E.H.M.”: I don’t know whether the
intake of liquids makes any difference
to the weight of a pig (B. 18/8/’4B), but
I remember a butcher buying a live pig
from the Canadian farmer for whom I
worked. The butcher wanted to stick
the pig to facilitate weighing it on clock-
scales he carried. Having sold the porker
liveweight per pound, the cocky insisted
he would lose so much weight in blood,
but the butcher protested that it would
make no difference. To settle the argu-
ment I was sent to a neighboring farm
to borrow platform-scales. On it the
pig was weighed alive and kicking. Stuck
afterwards, with gallons of blood lost, it
was weighed again. There was no differ-
ence between the weights.

“Horseless Horseman” ; Proof that the
equine hindquarters do most of the heavy
pulling (B. ,18/8/’4B) is the way that the
hooves of drovers’ wagonette horses wear
on dirt-road country. Around the
Darling (N.S.W.) it is only hind-shoes
that wear out. Hacks are rarely shod,
except in times of drought, and then
mostly it is only a matter of tacking a
couple of plates on the front feet —their
hind-hooves rarely wear down bare.

“Zake”: Apparently it depends on
whether a dog with a leg missing loses it
at the fore or aft end as regards his future
speed of movement. Saw a three-legged
hound at Bowenfels (N.S.W.) which could
run down a rabbit —he dispensed with an
offside hind leg, But a dog which does a
front leg in rarely can get into a gallop.

“Penola”: This “quiz” rage is far-
reaching, and quite a lot of country
school-teachers are trying to brighten up
school hours, I should say. It seems to
make the kids a bit more cocky, too, than
the ordinary school routine. A teacher
here told me about one lad the other day
whom he asked “What do you know of
the Kremlin?” The answer came in a
rush. “The Kremlin is not a real thing,
really. It is an imaginary horrible object
that worries airmen. They see this thing
sometimes when they are in the air and
make jokes about it, but they really
aren’t funny for the people who see
them. They pull things to bits. Some
people believe in the Kremlin, but really
it is only a little devil.” Anyway, where
did the word “gremlin” come from?
* * ♦ *
“B. A. Ker”: How such a “fiddle-
fingers” as my brother Charlie served five
years in the A.I.F. without absent-
mindedly twiddling the pin out of a Mills
bomb is one of the minor mysteries of
the war. But the characteristic is still
with him. Two hours after his arrival,
as we sat yarning near the fireplace, his
restless fingers discovered what I had not
found out in 15 years of use —the orna-
mental handle of the poker screwed off.
At supper he twiddled the knob off the
sugar-basin, and during breakfast the
fiddling-fingers unconsciously proved that
the “acorn” on the blind cord was made
up of two pieces—one screwing inside
the other. When we went shooting I kept
well to the side of his gun, and, although
he hadn’t fired any accidental shots when
we sat down for a smoke-oh, I purposely
sat on the side farthest away from the
12-gauge, The cigarette-holder he pro-
duced from his pocket had to be re-
assembled, and the cigarette-lighter took
some time to get going—several portions
had been twiddled off and were loose in
his pocket. As we talked a restless right
hand sneaked out, fiddled for a moment
with a broken end of wire-netting in the
fence against which we leaned, then
wandered upwards to pluck at the band
of its owner’s hat. From there it moved
across and began to pick splinters off the
post. Several minutes later a strange ex-
pression came into Charlie’s eyes; he
slowly turned his head and looked up-
wards and behind. His feat of taking off
from a sitting position, turning in mid-air
and landing 6ft. away with a dramatic
finger pointing to the fence immediately
above my head was an outstanding
athletic accomplishment, but it played
havoc with my nervous system. In the
middle of my terrified leap I heard him
gasp: “Look at him —and I was scratch-
ing under his chin! ” Why do frill-necked
lizards walk up wire-netting fences and
poke their heads through the mesh?
OLD PADDY’S MARKET.
When the last usher’s gone
And the stage doors are shut;
While darkness waits for dawn
Across the stage to strut,
Tivoli and Capitol,
Theatres of our time,
Fade in night’s misty shawl
While far-off clock-bells chime.
Then dimly we discern
Buildings of long-gone days
Where farmers came to learn
Prices of pigs and maize...
In a red building’s tower,
Four-faced, a clock we see,
Telling this is the hour
When memories go free.
That was the Market House
Facing on George-street, where
Men talked of crops and ploughs...
Listen and you will hear
(Where now the Capitol stands)
Old Paddy’s Market drown
The town with its noisy bands;
“A sheep for ’arf-a-crown! ”
“A penny tells your weight!”
“A battery for your nerves!”
“Green peas, a thrum a plate!”—
Mad cries that time preserves...
The lotteries stood there
Where ducks the marbles drew
With their long bills... “All’s fair!”
Chanted the lottery crew.
There were the merry-go-rouiids
Where now the Tivoli stage
Rings with the merry sounds
Of the fun of another age;
And where the neon beams
Turn night to colored lace
Farmers stabled their teams
On what was empty space.
What is there left of it all?
Old Paddy’s Market clock
Watches the minutes fall
Where the Fish Markets stock
Their wares at Woolloomooloo;
Like Time itself it stands
Pointing at fish and you
Its lean and threatening hands.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WO RRY. I'M SENDING IT OT GRAZCOS."
Fat-lamb Trials.
“Chappie”: Fat-lamb trials at
Gatton College (Q.) extending
over the last six years have
shown that there is a direct re-
lationship between the milking-
capacity of the ewe, the rate of
growth of the lamb and carcass
quality. The Romney Marsh-
Merino or the Border Leicester-
Merino cross gives a satisfactory
lamb-mother; its wool value is
high, milk supply good, body
conformation satisfactory and
the ewes have a remarkable de-
gree of uniformity. The Corrie-
dale showed more variation.
There was no difference in the
value of the fleeces produced by
the three ewe types, but fertility
of the Border Leicester cross
was outstanding. Maturity rate
of the B.L. cross compared with
the R.M. cross had no signifi-
cant difference, but both were
far better than the Corriedale.
B.L.-cross ewes proved to have
greater longevity than the others,
consequently the economic re-
sult favored this cross.
From a breeding viewpoint
Ryeland rams were unsatis-
factory, but Southdown and
Dorset Horns. proved reliable
lamb-getters. D.Hs. had the ad-
vantage of rapid maturity—a
week to a fortnight in the time
required to rear a lamb —but the
Southdowns’ progeny proved
more reliable in quality and
finish. Both breeds, said the col-
lege principal (N. W. Briton),
justified a place in Queensland
for the breeding of quality
lambs. Choice of breed would
depend largely on the district. In
the Australian Meat Board’s
Queensland lamb-carcass com-
petition, R. K. Grieve, Glenis-
ton, Yandilla, won two first
prizes and State championship.
The champions were by South-
down rams from B.L. x Merino
ewes, and were between 11 and
12 weeks old when slaughtered.
These lambs were put on green
oats the day they were dropped,
and remained there for six
weeks. For the last five weeks
they were given a fresh paddock
containing lucerne and oats. In
the State competition for other
than Southdowns, Grieve’s
winning carcasses—by Dorset
Horns —were one of the most
uniform pens in the competition.
Merino Embargo.
“Sam Square”; Rather than
the export of Merino rams (B.
6/10/’4B) being of tremendous
import to Australia, it would be
so to a few big stud-breeders,
who would receive big prices for
their rams. But it would force
the price of rams to a high level
and stop smaller flockowners
from buying good sires. When
the price of wool falls, as it
must eventually, flock-owners
won’t be able to pay big ram
prices and competition from
overseas buyers, probably sub-
sidised by their Governments,
will be too much for them.
Synthetics are no longer feared
as they were some years ago, the
excited competition for Aus-
tralian wool being proof in it-
self of that. Though synthetics
are being used, millions have dis-
covered that nothing is as good
as wool. It is true that no
country can rob us of our
Merino supremacy under pre-
sent conditions, but we would
lose that supremacy if other
countries could buy the pick of
our rams and send prices for
lesser quality to higher levels.
Generally, the only people in
favor of lifting the embargo are
the big stud-breeders, who would
make gains, but at the expense of
wool - producers in general.
Wool is our greatest source of
wealth and it has to be pro-
tected.
Sowing Grasses.
.“Plane Creek”: Although
quite good stands of Rhodes
grass, etc., are established in
Queensland simply by throwing
the seed in the ashes of a recent
burn, it ig a good idea to work
the land before planting any
grass.
Ploughing helps combat sub-
sequent weed growth which
might trouble the young grass.
The loosened soil also holds
moisture better and allows the
roots or underground rhizomes
of the grass to spread freely.
Free root growth is soon re-
flected in the growing grass.
Most introduced grasses only
give of their best on good, fer-
tile land. They may appear to
do all right on poor country, but
their food value may be low.
Tall-growing grasses can be
classed as drought-resistant, and
will usually succeed on a wider
range of soils than the dwarf-
growing types. The taller
grasses, however, seem to suc-
cumb to overstocking quicker
than the dwarf types, except
when the latter are expected to
last on poor, dry soils.
Ducks for Christmas.
“Myrrhee”: Begin prepara-
tions before the clutches are out.
The yards need to be clean, well
drained and shaded and the
houses well ventilated and shel-
tered from prevailing winds. If
an outside run is provided, allow
3 sq. ft, of floor space for each
duck and cover the floors with
clean straw or dry sand. Green-
feed is an essential food, so put
in a plot of greenstuff once a
fortnight from spring onwards
to ensure adequate and succu-
lent crops throughout the grow-
ing period.
Whether hatched by duck or
incubator, ducklings will need
plenty of sunshine. Feed them
a good chick mixture kneaded
into a moist mash with plenty
of chaffed green-feed. After
four or five weeks feed one of
these mixtures as much as they
will eat four times daily:
Wheat-pollard, 401 b,; ground
oats, 201 b.; bran, 301 b.; meat-
meal, 101 b.; or ground wheat or
barley, 301 b.; wheat-pollard,
301 b.; ground oats, 301 b.; meat-
meal, 101 b.; or ground wheat
or barley, 351 b.; ground oats,
351 b.; bran, 201 b.; meatmeal,
101 b. Add 25 p.c. of chaffed
green-feed. Skim-milk or boiled
fresh meat can be used to re-
place the meatmeal; don’t for-
get ample supplies of shell-
grit.
Administering Emetics.
“Gem”: An emetic for a dog
should be given from a large
bottle, wherein it can be mixed
well by shaking. The mouth of
the bottle is forced gently be-
tween the dog’s teeth; see that
the liquid doesn’t run straight
down his throat and into his
lungs. The usual method of
holding the dog’s mouth open by
pressing his jowls between his
back molars when giving
powders or medicine should be
avoided in cases of poisoning, as
the jowls are likely to be badly
bitten if the dog stiffens and
becomes unconscious with
spasms.
Air-dusting Crops.
“Agric”: Linseed and barley
crops on the Darling Downs are
being air-dusted with a D.D.T.
formula to defeat the corn-ear
worm attacking linseed, and the
army worm attacking barley.
The Moth plane is owned by
East-West Airlines. Crops are
dusted at dawn, the plane operat-
ing at a height of one to three
feet over the crops, and the cost
is less than 30s. per acre. It was
expected that all vulnerable crops
would be treated in 10 days, a
second plane being used for part
of the time.
R. A. Tulloch, who organised
supplies of dust and petrol on
behalf of Meggitt, Ltd., spon-
sors of a linseed-growing pro-
ject under which 5500 acres have
been sown in Queensland this
season, considers aerial dusting
has revolutionised pest control.
In view of the “spectacular re-
sults” which have been obtained
with selective weed-killers in
wheat crops at Mt. Tyson
“Hey, reverse that machine!"
against wild turnip, datura, mint,
dock and other weeds, he an-
ticipates a heavy call next season
for aerial spraying of wheat
crops.
An extensive area of linseed,
barley and oats in the Brook-
stead district of the Downs is to
be treated this year, and farmers
are following the operations with
great interest. If they can get
rid of their weed and insect pests
in one operation, and thereby
ensure capacity production of
crops from the soil, it will revo-
lutionise the industry. Many
American farmers now treat
their lands with selective weed-
killers before their wheat and
other crops come up.
Engine Bearings.
“Radian”: Correct way to fit
a new bearing is by spotting
and scraping. You want a
vice, spanners, a bearing-
scraper and marking - blue.
There are three different
types of big-ends: (1) The white
metal has been poured directly
into the connecting-rod and is a
fikture there. (2) The white
metal is cast in the form of top
and bottom liners, which are re-
movable from the rod and easily
replaced. (3) The rod is pro-
vided with removable steel
liners, which in turn are lined
with white metal. This type is
frequently in diesel and high-
compression engines.
Type (1) is ready to fit to the
shaft when received; but the
liners in (2) and (3) often re-
quire a certain amount of fitting
before the complete bearing is
ready to fit to the crankshaft.
Make sure the liners press right
home into the rod and cap and
that they are not prevented
from seating by tight-fitting
cheeks or burrs on the metal
Burrs should be removed with
a smooth file and tight cheeks
eased by scraping. Bearings
should be marked clearly so
that halves can always be
assembled the same way.
Wipe the crankshaft jcjurnal
clean and check small pits or
embedded particles which may
score the new bearing. Remove
them with an oilstone or fine
emery-cloth. Try each bearing
half to make sure it has suffi-
cient side clearance to seat on
the shaft. If not, scrape outer
cheeks to correct.
At this stage smear a very
light coating of blue on the
shaft, assemble the bearing on it
and tighten the nuts until the
rod just nips the journal. Turn
the shaft a full turn, dismantle
the bearing and check markings,
which will show on the white

To the many “FIRSTS” contributed to tractor design by
ALLIS CHALMERS are added two new outstanding
achievements —models HD.I9 and HD.S. Featuring the
revolutionary principle of Hydraulic Torque Converter
Drive, the HD.I9 is the world’s largest and most powerful
tractor —draw-bar pull exceeds 36,000 pounds!
The Torque Converter automatically balances speed with
load. Gear shifting is practically eliminated. There are
only TWO forward gear ratios—o-3 and 0-7 m.p.h.
Torque Converter makes this possible—automatically selects
the maximum speed at which load can be moved. It
protects tractor from destructive shock loads and makes the
HD. 19 one of the easiest of all tractors to operate.
The new model HD.S is a 37 H.P. 11,000-lb. tractor—the
smallest in the A.C. crawler range—and the most advanced
in its power class. Engineered completely new throughout, it
features big tractor design, balance and stamina with 2-cycle
diesel power featuring electric push-button starting.
As in all Allis Chalmers crawler models, truck wheels,
support rollers and idlers require greasing only once in 1,000
hours!
This is only the beginning! . . . Allis Chalmers has set its
sights high. Keep up with A.C. developments.

metal as a series) of blue streaks.
These are high-spots and must
be carefully scraped off. When
scraping move the scraper with
a combined sideways and circu-
lar motion, removing a mere
film of metal at each scraping.
A little practice will show just
how much metal to take off and
where to take it from. After
removing all visible high-spots,
wipe the bearing clean, take
fresh markings and scrape ac-
cordingly. This process is con-
tinued until a marking shows
spots of blue distributed evenly
over the entire bearing surface,
no one spot pressing harder than
another. At this stage the bear-
ing may be assembled and ad-
justed for running, care being
taken that all oilways are clean
and clear of obstruction.
Shearers* Demands.
“Outback”: In the Industrial
Magistrate’s Court at Hughen-
den (Q.) it was stated that shear-
ing at Bogunda began on March
31 last. The following morning
the shearers complained that the
water reticulated to the shed was
unsatisfactory, and they asked
that water be carted from a bore
eight miles away. To this the
manager agreed. On the even-
ing of April 1 the shearers com-
plained that this water also was
unsatisfactory, and asked that
water be carted from an over-
shot dam, filled from the shear-
ing-shed bore. The manager
pointed out that the water in the
dam came from the same bore
as the water the shearers had at
first condemned, and as it was
open to stock he did not con-
sider the dam water suitable for
human consumption. However,
the shearers insisted on this
water being supplied, and the
manager supplied it.
Work proceeded until April
20. Then the shearers refused
to start, alleging that the mill on
the shed bore was not pumping
fast enough. They demanded
that an auxiliary engine be in-
stalled. This was done. But
when the bell rang for work and
the engine started a meeting was
held, after which four shearers
and the woolpresser informed
the overseer that they were not
starting, and were leaving the
place. The remainder completed
the shearing. Imposing a fine of
£7 10s. on three of the shearers
concerned, the magist r ate said
he considered the breach in a
serious light, and in such cases
in future he would have no hesi-
tation in imposing the maximum
penalty.
Hints for the Farm.
“Bill C.”: The farrowing sow
should be freed of mange-mites
three or four weeks before the
suckers arrive. An effective pre-
paration consists of yellow sub-
phur seven parts, turpentine one
part, with sufficient light oil to
make a sticky mixture. Rub the
paste on, repeating in a few
days if necessary. To get rid of
external parasites on baby pigs,
dip the piglets briefly into luke-
warm lime-sulphur solution on
a fine day.
“Ben Acre”: Farm roads can
be built with a disk cultivator.
With the cultivator set so that
the front disks skim the ground
and the back ones cut several
inches, work up and down the
track with the disks throwing
the earth to the centre. Work
outwards as the formation builds
up. Finish with a light skim-
ming or harrowing if necessary.
“C.A.A.”: Formaldehyde (40
p.c.) is excellent for fumigating
glass-house soils. Mix a gallon
with 49 gallons of water for an
area of 15 square yards. Apply
by simultaneously turning the
soil and wetting it with the solu-
tion. Saturate soil and leave for
three to four weeks before plant-
ing. Cover the soil with wet
bags for a few days. For heaps
of soil, saturate in 6in. layers
with the 2 p.c. solution as the
heap is built, finally covering
the whole with bags for 48
hours. Fifty gallons of diluted
formaldehyde will saturate about
\\ tons of soil.
“Billjim”: A cheap and effec-
tive sulphur v spray for use
\vhere mildews or rust have
attacked ornamental plants can
be made by dissolving Hoz. of
liver of sulphur in 14 pints of
water; make 14oz. of wheat-
flour into a thin paste up to two
pints, boil until it froths and add
liver of sulphur solution. This
spray leaves practically no un-
sightly deposit on the leaves but
will discolor paintwork.
“Mul”: When attacking snails
and slugs, don’t overlook their
biggest breeding-place —under
the house and similar dark
places. Eliminate it by sprink-
ling a liberal amount of lime
around such spots, notably about
piles and where the snails can
climb.
“Urana”: Our cattle - bitch
died giving birth to a litter of
pedigreed pups, which we were
anxious to save. We tried
bottle-feeding with diluted cow’s
milk, but one by one they died
until there were only two of the
eight left. Then we were told
that dog’s milk is richer than
cow’s and that we should be
adding cream instead of reduc-
ing it. This we did and reared
the survivors.
“E.M.R.”: To get the best
result from a separator make
sure that the crank-handle or
driving-wheel is turned at the
speed specified by the makers.
Different makes have different
speeds because of the varying
sizes of the bowl and the way
they are geared.
“R. Howie”: Loss and worry
of fence-breaking can be largely
prevented by training stock to
respect fences. Never tie a calf
or pet lamb to a fence. Keep
very young calves in a shed, out
of sight of the mothers. Older
calves should have a strongly-
fenced paddock with a barb at
bunting height. Keep all wires
tightly strained and replace
rotted posts. Don’t overstock:
hungry beasts are hard to hold.
Rotational grazing, besides pay-
ing dividends in extra grass, also
saves fence repairs. Where stock
have the run of several paddocks,
stragglers often fail to find the
gate, and so break through to
regain the mob. Sucking calves
especially should never be able
to get on the wrong side of the
fence from their mothers.


HOLDEN
will be
precision built
General Motors modern plant and equipment start a new era
in Australian motor car manufacture
When General Motors engineers designed the new
Holden they also planned the new manufacturing
plants to build the car. New buildings were erected
and the world’s most modern equipment was
installed. This equipment is the latest and the best
of its kind, and its use represents the greatest step
forward in automobile manufacture in this country.
Holden will be produced by what is known as
“precision mass production”, which brings to
Australia new marvels of accuracy in manufacturing.
Many parts arc made to tolerances as fine as
i/io,oooth of an inch on machines designed to
produce components of uniformly high quality.
Highly trained inspectors using intricate gauges and
precision testing equip-
ment are engaged con-
stantly in checking material
as well as the dimensions and performance of parts.
These techniques of modern mass production set
standards of quality and precision quite impossible
of achievement with older methods. The final
precision mass produced Holden will maintain the
high standard of the first hand built models.
Every phase in the manufacture of the new Holden
has had the advantage of the greatest pool of experi-
ence in the automotive industry—from General
Motors Corporation. In Australia, with funds approxi-
mating £ B \ million outlayed in Australian opera-
tions, General Motors-Holden’s are in the unique
position of having plant and equipment specially
designed to produce a car that in every respect
answers the particular needs of Australian motorists.
We are proud of Holden. It’s Australia’s own car.
Watch for it. Holden will be here soon.

Fergus was right, perhaps. You
couldn’t trust yellow hair like
that!
When one forgot the hair,
there were other features, to be
sure. There were two eyes
very seeing eyes. Blue they were
sometimes, and at other times
greenish, and a touch of yellow
in them all the time. Just like
a cat, someone said, though the
yellow tint in the eyes was pure
imagination, no doubt. There
was a nose, too, sharp and
straight, and a longish and very
smooth face, nicely tinted,
though the naturalness or other-
wise was a fit subject for de-
bate ; a fairly big mouth with
very thin lips, and a lot of very
white teeth, two of them promin-
ently gold-capped.
There was the impression of a
tall figure, neatly tailored, and a
pair of stylish shoes. Altogether,
from yellow hair, “wid nary a
touch,” to tan shoes, here was
something entirely out of keep-
ing with Coolty Creek. Just the
same, something that would be
at home and at cool ease any-
where.
Everyone stared and pretended
not to. Yellow-hair without
noticing the stares, and yet well
aware of them, went towards
the bar. She picked out Me-
Nulty from the group near the
door.
“McNulty?”
The absence of “Mr.” was
noted.
She introduced herself. c< l’m
Mrs. Frew!” She emphasised
the “Mrs.”
McNulty said “Good morn-
ing!” —greeting ignored —and
intimated that he was expecting
her. Then he felt that perhaps
introduction to the others was
desirable, from R business point
of view. Mrs. Frew, without
saying so much, gave a slight
gesture to indicate that she didn’t
need it—they’d get to know
each other soon enough. But
she was ready to take over. She
nodded to the coach outside—
“My trunks!” McNulty him-
self went to get them. Mrs.
Frew dispensed with hat and
coat; gave her mass of hair a
few deft two-handed pats and
took over. And the change
was on.
Mrs. Frew served the drinks
in the bar with a click and a
precision. She smiled and spoke
with similar precision. If any
stared at her, her fleeting glance
was sufficient to turn the eyes of
him who stared to a contempla-
tion of the cobwebs at the tops
0 f the walls and on the ceilings.
As far as these cobwebs were
concerned, that first day was
their last.
Mr. McNulty removed them,
Outside Felix Ovens the
teamster, spat right over the
hitching-rail, girded his loins
more comfortably with his belt,
and more deliberately spat again
over the rail. Then he said
“Gawd!” It was a short speech
for a teamster like Mr. Ovens,
But it really summed up the
general view ; so it was quite un-
necessary for Fergus MacMahon
to repeat the sentiment with
“Just a machine.”
In the shop at the same time
as all this, Mr. McNulty was
having a little trouble with Mrs.
O’Brien—the thin and cranky
one from Say’s Crossing. Mrs.
O’Brien always brought trouble
to her shopping. Mrs. Frew
came in through the dividing-
door. She said fo McNulty,
“Mind the bar a while,” and
McNulty went to mind it. Mrs.
O’Brien was served and fixed
and out at her sulky without as
much as ten words more being
spoken—and Mrs. O’Brien hav-
ing not more than two of them,
Mrs. O’Brien’s usually sleepy
horse went home that day to
Say’s Crossing at a speed that
neither she nor anyone else had
ever thought possible.
In a month the pub and store
were brand-new in a solid coat
of heavy stone paint. Inside
were bright blue ceilings and
cream walls. The store had
completely changed its person-
ality of disorder and had become
a city emporium in miniature.
The bar was likewise altered.
And McNulty was also altered
—and looking considerably
older. He was even detected in
talk of a friendly nature with
Brogan. Further, he seemed to
have lost the capacity for being
in two or more places at the
same time.
ONE evening Mrs. Frew said;
“McNulty! ”
“Yes, Mrs. Frew?”
“You needn’t call me Mrs.
Frew. Call me Stella, but not
Stell.”
“Yes, er —Stella.”
“People are beginning to talk,
McNulty.”
“People often do, Mrs. —
Stella.” '
“Don’t pretend to misunder-
stand—you know well enough
what I mean.”
McNulty looked surprised and
puzzled.
“I am being compromised.”
McNulty didn’t know the
term, but it sounded serious,
and he was shocked.
“Who’s doing it?” he asked.
“You, of course!”
“Me!”
“Yes. And you’d better speak
to Father Kelly—when he calls
on Monday for his glass of
whisky.”
“But”
That was practically the first
time in McNulty’s life that he
said “but!” It was certainly
the last.
McNulty had it at the back of
his mind to make some pertinent
inquiry about Mr. Frew, feeling
that it would be much more
proper if that gentleman were
dead. “Your first husband —
Mr. Frew —now —he”
“My first husband was
Chorlie. Dead! My second
husband was Frew. Dead!”
“Oh!” McNulty looked
startled.
“ W hat did you say?”
“Nothing,”
“You said ‘Oh!’”
“I meant nothing.”
“That’s all right, then” . .
ft was a quiet wedding, but
even at that hardly quiet enough
f or McNulty. And when it was
all over lots of the locals came
along to the pub to gloat over
McNulty. But they had to do it
n ot too obviously, nor let Mrs.
McNulty observe them. Still,
it was great to behold McNulty
stripped of his power, and as
Fergus MacMahon said, “If you
ask me, his money is in danger,
t oo.”
Go where one would at
Coolty Creek, a great mass of
hair WOUld be in the Hne
of view _ in the bar a nd the shop
a t the same time, and all in the
same minute down with the pigs,
or in the big store-shed at the
back of the shop. And Mc-
Nulty was a fixture, and you
knew where he’d be. And the
locals just spoke to him now as
an ordinary man—and just a
little lower down than them-
selves.
Qne Sunday morning Mc-
Nulty said, “Stella, dear, I’d like
to lie in a bit longer this morn-
mg-”
“You can’t—there’s church at
MacMahon’s.”
“Yes—l’d nearly forgot. What
clothes will I wear, dear?”
Even as he asked, McNulty
knew that no man can sink lower
than that.

A NEW DEVELOPMENT
Spreader Firing, combined with
Forward Moving Grate
The introduction of the
Forward Moving Grate,
discharging ash continu-
ously, has widened the scope
of Spreader Firing because:
1. Combustion conditions
are not disturbed by inter-
mittent ash removal.
2. There is no clinker for-
mation, even with ash
having very low fusion tem-
perature, as the bulk of the
air required for combustion
passes through and cools
the ash layer, thereby
avoiding harmful deposits
on the pressure parts.
3. Automatic control is
simply applied.
4. High burning rates are
readily attained, as the fuel
and the air are evenly dis-
tributed over every square
foot of grate area.

“Clear and Simple.”
“The Public Service Board was alive
to the need for clear and simple Eng-
lish.” — Mr. Chifley replying to criti-
cism by Fraser, M.H.R., of official
correspondence.
The Prime Minister sent for
his secretary. “Look, Mac,” he
said, “Fraser’s complainin’
about our language.”
“Whose?” asked the secretary.
“Eddie’s?”
“No, not that sort of language.
It’s our ‘officialese.’ Fraser says
no one can understand it.
Mebbe he’s right—even I don’t
know what Evatt’s talking about
half the time. Anyway, you’d
better send out a letter. Er —
something like this.” The P.M.
cleared his throat:
It has—er —been brought to notice
that departmental correspondence and
publications are —er not being
framed with the maximum care and
efficiency, and that difficulty in com-
prehending official instructions and
requests is giving rise to serious
bottlenecks in—er —in interdepart-
mental communications and cor-
respondence with the public. To
remedy this state of affairs, there-
fore, and to save paper and time, all
“Have you ever tied your own birdseed, Mr. Williks?”
Government personnel will paj* parti-
cular attention to ensuring that all
communications are so written that
their meaning can easily be under-
stood by the persons to whom they
are directed.
“I think that covers it nicely,”
said the P.M. “Send it off to all
departments.”
The secretary sent for the
assistant-secretary. “Bill,” he
said. “The P.M. wants us to cut
down on the official jargon in
our letters. You’d better draft a
letter. Something like this.”
The secretary furrowed his brow
and pretended to think while
glancing discreetly at his notes:
The Government has been advised
that, in the preparation of depart-
mental and interdepartmental com-
munications and publications and in
general correspondence with the
public, insufficient consideration is
being given by the writers to care,
economy and efficiency in expressing
the matter in hand, and that grave
bottlenecks are thereby accumulating
and causing serious delay in the ex-
pedition of Government business. In
an endeavor to remedy this state of
affairs and to conserve paper and
effort, Government personnel, there-
fore, will, at all times, in the framing
of correspondence and other publica-
tions, give particular consideration to
ensuring the simplification of all com-
munications in such a manner that
their meaning can be readily com-
prehended by the recipient or person
to whom they are directed,
“Something like that should
do,” said the secretary with a
touch of pride.
The assistant-secretary sent
for the chief clerk. “Oh, Jim,”
he said. “The P.M. has just
asked me to give the departments
a shaking-up about the con-
founded jargon they use in their
correspondence. Take a letter
to all under-secretaries, will
you.” He leaned back in his
chair so that he could see the
notes on his lap under the desk.
A growing tendency has been ob-
served on the part of Government
personnel, in the preparation of de-
partmental and interdepartmental
communications and publications and
correspondence with the general
public, to devote insufficient con-
sideration to care, economy and effi-
ciency in the expression of the
matter in hand, thereby giving rise
to a grave accumulation of serious
bottlenecks, the effect of which is to
cause unnecessary delays in the rapid
expedition of important Government
business. In an endeavor to apply
a corrective to this state of affairs, and
to avoid unnecessary wastage of paper
and to conserve effort, all Government
and semi-Government personnel will,
therefore, whenever possible, in the
preparation of Government and semi-
Government communications, cor-
respondence and other publications,
direct every effort in an attempt to
give particular consideration to en-
suring the simplification of all such
communications in a manner that
will facilitate their ready compre-
hension by the person to whom they
are addressed or by any other re-
cipient or reader thereof.
“We could say considerably
more about this matter,” added
the assistant-secretary. “But
we’d better set a good example
by being brief, clear and to the
point. I think that covers the
situation satisfactorily, don’t
you?”
“Perfectly,” said the chief
clerk.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
4|d. per line; all others 2£d. per line.
Liberal v. “Labor”
W. H, Spooner (B. 29/9/’4B) may aver
that the Liberal party presents “a strong
and united movement,” and that “the
party’s policy has been forthrightly
stated again and again” ; but it is only
cold tea against the “Labor” brew. Few
people are pricked into remembering
Liberal policy, even if they hear it.
Compare, these reports made at the
respective conferences held in September.
“Labor”:
The conference reaffirmed the voluntary
system of enlistment for the Australian
' Defence Forces. The general feeling was
that if war occurred, the position could be
re-examined.
Clear and straightforward. Now the
Liberals: —
Defence. Complete and constant review
of the resources of this country, and the
means by which these resources may be
directed to the defence of the country in
the event of emergency.
That’s like the stock utterances of a civil
servant.
“Labor” again:
Nationalisation of banking credit and
insurance, monopolies, shipping, public
health, radio services and sugar-refining.
Liberal: —
The council expresses the opinion that
public utilities should be operated, wherever
practicable, by private enterprise, subject to
such statutory safeguards of the public, and
especially of consumer, interests, as might
be deemed necessary.
The “Labor” platform is exact. Either
you are for it of against it. The Liberals
are as unsettled as a raincloud. If it is
going to let down rain, nobody knows
just where or how much.
Criticism is valuable only if the party
has a planned alternative. Idle slandering
of the P.M, and his associates week after
week may flatter the righteousness of the
Opposition and please their followers, but
it does not attract new adherents.
Those of us who looked for a banner,
or even a rallying-cry, from the Liberal
conference in Adelaide were let down.
Neither Casey’s speech nor the Liberal
platform contained a worth-while chal-
lenge to the Government. Resolutions
and speeches were vague and no different
from those which lost them Federal
control in 1941, With Chifley and the
“Labor” party, however unpleasant the
prospects, the platform is well defined.
These extracts from addresses to the
respective conferences typify the force-
fulness of one party against the negative
attitude of the other. Chifley:
If there is a great public utility essential
to the needs of the public that is badly
managed or handled, it should be national-
ised. But nationalising hamburgers, or ice-
cream, or permanent waves, is not our
business.
Casey:
The Liberal party stood for the maximum
freedom of the individual, consistent with
the complications of modern life. It stood
against “the fancy system of Socialism”
which had no achievements except the con-
centration camps.
—Excelsior (S.A.).
As a member of a metropolitan branch
of the Liberal party, I can’t agree with
W. H. Spooner that the overwhelming
majority of Liberals want to see one non-
Labor party. The rank and file of the
party believe that to vacate certain
country areas and leave the field to the
Country party would be a betrayal of
Liberal principles. What the rank and
file rellly want to see is any non-Labor
politician elected in every country seat.
Obviously that necessitates putting up
the best candidate that the parties have
to offer. In real country districts experi-
ence has shown that the Country-party
man has the best qualifications. Near-
metropolitan electorates are another story.
Robertson, just off the north-western
fringe of Sydney, has always been a
Liberal-party sphere of influence and
never a C.P. seat. The Country party
would be the first to recognise that, pro-
vided its own claims were also recog-
nised.
There is a fairly clear line of demarca-
tion between Liberal and C.P. areas.
There is no question of making “a series
of bargains.” The 1946 elections proved
plainly enough where the various parties
stand in all electorates.
The Liberal party should be fully occu-
pied in trying to regain lost territory in
metropolitan areas. Realists see the party
as the spearhead of an attack on “Labor,”
attacking where it hurts the Socialists
most —in cities. The Country party can-
not do this, but as the anti-Socialist
partner it deserves just as much recog-
nition for its efforts as the Liberals.
Statements such as Mr. Spooner’s, sug-
gesting a lack of accord between the two
parties, can do much harm to non-Labor
chances in the next elections. Lack of
understanding between Menzies and
Fadden in 1946 contributed in no small
way to their defeat. —J. B. R, (N.S.W.).
W. H. Spooner (B. 29/9/’4B) talks
about the flood of Socialistic writings over
the last 50 years —and the lack of a reply
to it. The Socialists had an open field
when they started, and oppression and
poverty were so severe, at certain times
and in certain places, that destructive
criticism had its use, and of course its
popularity. And there was the great ad-
vantage of its setting a new fashion.
Writers still pander to a popular theme,
and a sort of convention has been de-
veloped that taints otherwise honest stuff.
Let the writer of The Harp in the South
explain why she made such a song of the
dreadful poverty of the Surry Hills
family, giving the impression that they
were starving on about £2 a week when
the old man, admittedly working, must
have been on at least the basic wage.
But I can’t agree that the flood is not
countered —it is, continuously. Brave
New World was an early word to the wise
on the humorless, heartless goal of the
“planners,” and lately we have had the
authentic modern horror of The Green
Isle of the Great Deep and Darkness at
Noon. They are at the end of the road;
at its beginning, we can look back on
the country we are leaving in 100 writings.
Silver Ley, Allawah, How Green Was My
Valley and even “Mat’s Mate” —any such
writing recognises the worth of work, guts
and enterprise, and of humanity and
mutual respect between men. Some like
that sort of thing; others prefer the idea
of something for nothing, and all troubles
solved by the State, It makes a pleasant
supplement to the scullery dreams of dis-
guised earls coming across with honest
marriage to down-trodden wenches.
I should say the remedy is not in
writing more replies, but in the ethics and
manhood of the readers. Still, I’m hoping
“So you thought you could, give me the slip, did you ?”
that someone will yet write an authentic
Australian novel, in which good wages
and the best living conditions of the world
are admitted, and strikers held up not
as suffering martyrs with hearts of gold,
but as a powerful vested interest, exploit-
ing the helpless,— Khasi R. (N.S.W.).
Murray Bridge
Some day, perhaps, a breakwater will
be constructed at the Murray mouth and
locks built to allow ships to cross the
barrage at Goolwa and proceed to
Murray Bridge.
With the parent river already locked
for navigation, the Murrumbidgee’s flow
controlled by the Burrinjuck Dam, .and
projected schemes to control the waters
of the Darling, river steamers and barges
would provide cheap transport for wool,
wheat, fruits and dairy produce from
such places as Albury, Gundagai and
Mungindi, direct to this port. Here the
inland flotilla could tie up alongside the
overseas freighters and discharge their
cargoes direct into the latters’ holds.'
New Orleans grew from the trade
carried down the Mississippi, Missouri
and Ohio rivers, and the same thing
could happen to an Australian city serv-
ing the 414,000 square miles drained by
the Murray system. Murray Bridge could
be that city.—C. A. L. (W.A.),
Farmer and Hand
If “L.P.” (B. 15/9/’4B) was one of the
many who tramped the bush during the
depression, I was one of the cockies
whom he damns with faint praise. He
seems to think that farmers made a favor
of giving him a job, and then found too
much work for him to do. Of course
there was too much work —there always
is on a farm, and during the depression
there were few properties not under-
manned and neglected because, with
wheat at Is. 9d., wool at 6d. and fat lambs
at 65., the owners just hadn’t the money
to pay wages.
For months a man worked for me for
10-bob a week. To pay him that I went
without things myself. He had a sound
cottage, plenty of meat, flour, milk, eggs,
fuel —anything I could provide that hadn’t
to be bought with the cash I didn’t have —
and he was free to take any casual outside
jobs he could find. Grateful for help in
preserving his self-respect by keeping him
off the dole, when things improved he
came back looking for a permanent job.
No doubt some property-owners ex-
ploited the unemployed, but “L.P.” should
see both sides of the picture instead of
nursing resentment against all farmers as
a class. Any deterioration in the relations
between farmer and hand is less an after-
math of the depression than another
symptom of the poisonous class-distrust
which the Commos are sowing every-
where today. On the land, more than
anywhere else, the creed of “less work for
more pay” is futile. The farmer, as well
as his employee, has to work hard and
long, with nature as the taskmaster of
both.— Kell (N.S.W.).
The Snowy Waters
According to “0.T.” (B. 15/9/’4B),
the whole idea of diverting the Snowy
River should be examined before any
scheme is accepted. It has been —by the
Economic and Agricultural Advisory
Committee appointed by the Federal
Government. The committee found that
the Snowy should be diverted into the
’Bidgee and advanced the following
ground—among others —to support its
findings.
The area bound by Hay, Balranald,
Moulamein, Deniliquin, Jerjlderie and
Narrandera —a semi-arid region—could
be watered cheaply by the Murrum-
bidgee maintained at full capacity, which
would lead to its development by thou-
sands of trained but, at present, landless
farmers.
Further findings were that without
irrigation the lower ’Bidgee area might
soon have to be written off altogether;
that an assured supply of water could be
used to fight soil erosion; that diver-
sion of the Snowy into the ’Bidgee could
be effected at about half the cost of
diverting it into the Murray, and that at
this stage in our development irrigation
means much more than electrification to
Australia. — Old Firm (Q.).
Petrol Tax
I have an 8-h.p, roadster—one of the
most economical models to keep on the
road —yet this is what it costs me: Regis-
tration and insurance, £l2 a year ; garag-
ing, £l3 ; petrol (at 2s. a gallon),
£7 15s. 3d. Running repairs and oil are
extra.
For every gallon of petrol the Federal
Government takes 10yd. tax, a tax
originated by Dr. Earle Page in 1926 for
the specific purpose of developing “Aus-
tralian roads of a standard suitable for
motor traffic.” The tax was then 3d.
Despite the tremendous tax increase since
then, Australian roads have never been
more in need of Commonwealth aid than
they are now.
Of the £l6 million paid in petrol tax in
the past 12 months, only £6 million has
been handed over to the States for its
proper purpose—road-works. Nor are
conditions likely to improve under the
present Government, since Chifley him-
self, in a letter to the N.R.M.A. last year,
wrote bluntly that “as far as the Com-
monwealth is concerned, this tax is
primarily a revenue impost and its main-
tenance is necessary to meet the expendi-
tures of the Commonwealth.”— Mac
(N.S.W.).
Wheat Stabilisation
“Waldo” (B. 6/10/’4B) is apparently
one of those Martin-place economists
who deal in figures to the nearest 20
million. It would be interesting to know
how he would justify the figure of “be-
tween £6O and £BO million” which, he
says, has been paid to the wheat cockies
since 1930, and also to see a specific allo-
cation of this money instead of “writing
down capital debt, rail freight, etc.”
As to the Farmers and Settlers’ Associa-
tion being comprised of “politicos and
aspiring politicians,” “Waldo” is off the
track, as the membership of that associa-
tion comprises the bulk of the organised
wheatfarmers of N.S.W. Perhaps the
crowd who were advocating “Yes” in the
wheat vote allowed themselves to be
swayed by the “Waldo” sort of figuring
and argument.— Dick Turpin (N.S.W.).
Australian Air-letters
If the P.M.G. could spare a moment
from rapt contemplation of his Is. 3d,
futuristic jew-lizard, I suggest that a 4d.
air-letter stamp be struck and printed on
forms identical with the present overseas
air-letters, which sell at 7d, and ensure
a reply from London in 10-12 days.
To those here in Queensland who have
any extensive correspondence to keep up,
living more than 500 miles from the
capital of their State represents a
definite drain on finances—four letters a
week mean 525. a year surcharge on
ordinary mail rates.
Getting down to simple proportion: If
it costs 7d. to send a quarter of an ounce
13,000 miles, what should it cost to send
half an ounce 2000 miles? The answer
is not nor even 4d. — Video (Q.).
New States
New-Staters very nearly cheered when
they read in a Sydney daily that the
Federal A.L.P. conference had decided to
add to the “Labor” platform a proposal
to give the Commonwealth Parliament
authority to create New States or Pro-
vinces, and thus by-pass obstinate State
authorities.
Then the “Standard,” official organ of
the party, came out with the full story.
The aim of the conference was:
To clothe the Commonwealth Parliament
with sovereign powers, and with authority
to create States or Provinces possessing
delegated Constitutional powers.
That is something different altogether—
Canberra to have absolute power to legis-
late over anything it wishes. Of course
State Parliaments could legislate too —in
the manner that Canberra permits.
In a country as vast as Australia,
freedom and local self-government go
hand-in-hand, and if State Parliaments
are to be little more than administrators
of Commonwealth law, we will be left
completely at the mercy of one central
Government.— New-Stater (N.S.W.).
“Dee” and others suggest that the im-
portant determining factor in the creation
of new States is the actual position of the
boundaries. That is far from the case.
New-State conventions generally have
not made an early determination of
boundaries in case they cause premature
friction between districts which are in-
cluded in them and those which are not.
There have been many proposals put
forward for the boundaries of the
northern State. All have included the
Richmond and Clarence, and most the
Northern Tablelands. The main doubt
surrounds the southern boundary, which
may extend to the Macleay, Hastings,
Manning or Hunter Rivers,
Without definitely committing itself,
the new-State movement generally envis-
ages the capital of the northern new State
at Armidale. Experience has shown in
Australia that coastal capitals tend to in-
flate themselves at the expense of sur-
rounding districts, but an inland capital,
such as Armidale, accessible from all
directions, would tend to extend its in-
fluence equally in all directions.
The question of including the Northern
Tablelands in the new State is not one
of whether or not they fall inside the
“natural” area, but whether these
northern towns would prefer to be
governed from Sydney or an adjacent
provincial centre.
New means of communication would
quickly provide a community of interest.
Sydney has on several occasions promised
a coa'st-to-tablelands railway, and on one
occasion actually voted the money for it.
A new State could make that railway a
fact.
The exact boundaries of the new State
are not important at this stage. What is
important is a feeling of regional pride
in the new-State citizen, and an awaken-
ing to the exploitation that has resulted
through government from Sydney.—
Barrington (N.S.W.).


Trade with S.-E. Asia
Our Singapore newspaper features the
news that Mr. Calwell had introduced a
bill to establish Australian citizenship
whereby Australians abroad must register
every year. I can’t see the necessity for
it, unless it is to assist the Minister in for-
bidding Australians to go abroad. Should
they be fortunate enough to escape his
clutches he would then wield the big stick
—“Come back or your passport will be
“Stand clear, Elsie —here she comes!”
cancelled and you’ll lose your Australian
citizenship.”
Passports are issued under the authority
of the Governor-General, and automati-
cally expire after a certain period unless
renewed. Surely that is a sufficient safe-
guard to enable the authorities to keep
track of those abroad.
Australia is in bad odor in the East
these days, and any derogatory news is
eagerly snapped up by the newspapers.
The Cabinet’s bungling of the deporting
of the Malay seamen and the prolonged
hesitation about sending arms to help
fight the terrorists are headline news.
Despite the general scarcity of goods,
merchants here are finding it hard to
push Australian products because of the
wholesale dumping in 1946 of in-
ferior goods. Only the other day I was
shown a tin of Australian marmalade
which had a few shreds of what may have
been lemon- or orange-peel. Many
businessmen prefer not to handle Aus-
tralian goods, and one manufacturer I
know will accept them only as a last
resort.
South-east Asia offers a wonderful
market for Australian manufacturers, but
if they want to build a reputation for
quality they’ll have to evolve some simple
system whereby the public can distinguish
the good from the bad. A typical ex-
ample of what happens occurred the other
day. A housewife complained that Aus-
tralian tinned goods were not up to the
standard she expected, and I found that
the stuff at fault was of obscure origin.
I told her to stick to several brands which
I remembered from before the war. She
hasn’t complained since.
The goods complained of may have
been from war-time canneries which had
lost their Government contracts and were
cashing-in on high prices here. What-
ever their origin, such goods have done
Australia’s name a lot of harm. — Hari
Ini (Singapore).
Accidents
A public inquiry was ordered into
the loss of the airliner Lutana, yet
the recent Queensland road tragedy in-
volving the same loss of life as well as
injuries to others is passed by as an in-
evitable ' addition to the alarming “toll
of the roads.”
In air travel the public is protected by
a complex system of safety measures
evolved from world-wide research and
administered by the Department of Civil
Aviation. To ensure a high level of effi-
ciency airline transport pilots are re-
quired to pass a medical examination
and a practical flying test at regular half-
yearly intervals in order to renew their
licences. No doubt Australia’s remark-
able freedom from air accidents reflects
the thoroughness with which these mea-
sures are enforced.
It is disturbing to consider the neglect
of any such steps in regard to safety in
road transport. A motor-driver who
assumes responsibility for human life.
similar to that of the captain of an air-
craft, may not have had a driving test or
medical examination since the day his
licence was issued. —V. L. (Vic.).
Migrants and Houses
The head of the Australian Military
Mission in Germany, and chief delegate
to the International Refugee Organisa-
tion, has announced that Australia wants
an unlimited number of displaced persons
and their depend-
ants. He added that
“first - class resettle-
ment opportunities”
could be provided
for them.
The situation as
seen by Australians
themselves is some-
what different. There
are thousands of
people living in tents,
caravans, ex - Army
huts and garages be-
cause these are the
only homes they can
find. Young married
people have lived for
years with relations
or in rooms. Re-
turned soldiers with
wives and children
spend all their spare-
time looking, for
decent accommoda-
tion.
Young children in
housing settlements,
camping reserves and
other crowded areas
are growing up to
accept communal
living and lack of
privacy as the normal
state of affairs.
Young men and
women are holding
off from marriage
“until they find a home.” Firms, inquir-
ing into the matter, find that the housing
position is causing a drop in “morale,”
health and efficiency of their staffs, while
in official circles there is panic at the
sharp decline in the birthrate.
Whether the Government’s mass-immi-
gration scheme is desirable or not, it is
most unfair both to Australians and in-
tending immigrants at present. An influx
of people from other countries when
Australians themselves cannot find homes
can do nothing but aggravate a housing
position that is already almost unbear-
able. — Mac (N.S.W.).
Mental Hospitals
Unfortunately the conditions in Gov-
ernment institutions referred to by
“8.P.D.” (B. 15/9/’4B) are not peculiar to
N. S. Wales. In Victoria a specially-
selected committee found appalling con-
ditions, most of which could be traced
to the human element. Defects in
organisation could be remedied, but for
failing humans, whether because of
unsuitability to the task, or of incom-
petence, or shirking of duty, abuse of
privilege or power, and more often be-
cause of overwork (for staff in every in-
stitution was being asked to carry nearly
a double load), the committee had no
remedy. . We shuddered when we asked
ourselves “what would happen, and what
will happen, if and when this little more
than skeleton staff breaks down?” Such a
thing is quite a possibility. In some mental
hospitals the present staff is more than ; 50
per cent, below normal in strength...
There are 7000 inmates of mental in-
stitutions in Victoria —almost 2000 in
Mont Park alone. Health Minister Dun-
stan has not told anybody yet what the
Government proposes to do; but there
is always the pigeonhole. —R. M. (Vic.).
Pension Grab
Following . its policy “to take from
those who can well afford it some of their
income and redistribute it to those who
do the hard and arduous work of the
country,” Canberra “Labor” proposes a
members’ pension scheme ofi£B per week
for life for defeated members who have
served eight years and are over 45 years.
Defeated members who are ineligible can
collect a refund of their contributions.
Provision is to be made to pay £5 a
week to a member’s widow.
It is suggested that members contri-
bute £7B a year, the same as in the N. S.
Wales pension grab. Of the State scheme,
A. T. Traversi, an actuary of some stand-
ing, calculates £215 a year would be
needed from each member to make the
scheme actuarily sound. As Federal
“Labor” proposes pensions far more
generous it seems the taxpayers will be
milked for the difference between £7B
paid by members and about £290 per
member which the grab will probably
cost.—F. D. (N.S.W.).
Scrap-iron Joe!
Port Kembla workers and wharfies who
struck against the sending of a little
scrap-iron to Japan before war broke
out would get a cynical, laugh out
of the list of commodities which the
U.S.S.R. agreed to send to Germany in
February, 1940, when- the Kremlin’s
Fascist ally was preparing to ravage Nor-
way, Denmark, Belgium, Holland,
Luxemburg and France and to slaughter
thousands of innocent British women and
children and Australian and other
soldiers.
The list unearthed by the U.S. State
Department among the Russian papers
in the German Foreign Office archives
revealed: 900,000 tons of mineral oil.
100.000 tons of cotton, 500,000 tons of
phosphates, 100,000 tons of chrome ores,
500.000 tans of iron-ore, 300,000 tons of
scrap-iron and pig-iron , and 3,400 kilo*
grams of platinum, apart from manga-
nese-ore, metals, lumber and numerous
other raw materials, all vital ingredients
of munitions.
The tyrant of the Kremlin made
arrangements not to allow export of
munition-making commodities, but actu-
ally saw to it that Hitler was provided
with them. And he knew what he was
doing and could have had no doubt about
the nature of his customer, whom he had
described only a few months before as a
“blood-drunk and diabolical murderer of
innocents.”—B. B. C. (N.S.W.).
Beer and Housing
Local-option being defunct under the
McGirrs, some Bondi (Sydney) people
suddenly discovered that an attempt
would be made to transfer the licence of
a pub from Newtown to the comer of
Glenayr-avenue and Beach-road, and that
the new pub building would mean the
destruction of four cottages and a block
of four flats, with the dehousing of the
families living in them. They sent a
petition against it to “Labor’s” Housing
Minister.
Minister Clive Evatt had the proposed
site declared a housing area on April 7,
1948. Although that meant that no hotel
could be built on the land and that the
homes would stay, the party interested
in the licence carried on. The Licensing
Court heard the application on June 29,
adjourned the hearing and subsequently
granted the transfer.
At Mosman, Cremorne, Balgowlah and
Ramsgate the story has been roughly the
same. Six shops, four with dwellings
attached, would have gone west at Mos-
man ; at Cremorne eight shops and
attached dwellings and two cottages; at
Balgowlah two cottages ; at Ramsgate a
shop with dwelling. All these places
were and are occupied. At other places,
such as Wiley Park, Abbotsford and
Beverley Hills, the land involved in the
pub transfer, did not necessarily have
existing homes on it, but most of it had
already been earmarked by the Housing
Commission for home-building lots.
A Mr. Harry Leonard Shaw runs the
Allawah Hotel, which is the registered
address of The Wiley Park Investments
Co. Pty., Ltd., a concern with a nominal
share capital of £25,000 in £1 shares,
though up to January 12, 1948, the com-
pany’s sole directors and only members
were Mr. Shaw and a Mr.
Slutzkin, holding one share
each. By a special resolution
dated June 7 this year a
third director was appointed
—John W. Shaw, to be “per-
manent managing - direc-
tor.”
This Wiley Park Invest-
ment Co., through the
Licensing Court, obtained
transfer of licence of the
Cleveland Hotel, Bucking-
ham-street, Sydney, to a
corner in Wiley Park, in
Premier McGirr’s Bankstown
electorate. Mr. Clive Evatt’s
Housing Commission stepped
in and acquired the site
after the transfer had been
granted. Mr. Shaw, whose
solicitor happened to be Mr.
Lancja, “Labor” M.L.A.,
didn’t seem at all pleased.
It is possible that with the
transfers of licences obtained
the parties concerned think
the transfers worth hanging
on to until ( a ) the Housing
Commission undergoes a
change of heart in the matter,
or (b) a reshuffle of McGirr
portfolios casts* up a new
Housing Minister, or (c)
both. There for the time being the whole
curious thing rests. — Niloc (N.S.W.).
Root of the Matter
The weekly salary of experienced male
nurses in Victoria has been raised to
£8 16s. a week, plus £1 living-out allow-
ance. Women staff nurses get £7 a week,
while a sister receives from £7 15s. to
£8 55., subject to board and lodging ad-
justments. The Royal College of Nurs-
ing has expressed “satisfaction,” but the
Trained Nurses’ Guild wants female
nurses paid the same as male nurses.
Among those protesting is ex-Army Prin-
cipal Matron Sage. The determination
means that adult males in training will
receive more money than the sister-in-
charge under whom they are training. If
ever there was a good case for equal
pay for equal work surely it is presented
by nursing.—M. R. (Vic.).
Chifley’s stated intention is “to take
from those who can afford it some of
their income and redistribute it to those
who do the hard work —the people who
really make the wheels go round.” That
policy has been given a blunter and truer
name—“robbing Peter to bribe Paul.” —
Tom (N.S.W.).
Queensland’s Chief Justice Macrossan
told 500 railwaymen at Ipswich the other
day that the 40-hour week had meant for
many workers “merely more time for
loafing, gambling and drinking.” And
what with State lotteries, horse- and dog-
racing, night-trots, betting at Sunday foot-
ball matches and so forth the several
Governments encourage them. The one
ih Sydney had to clamp down on the
spreading housie-housie sessions the other
day—at least until some union bucks
about depriving the poor man of his
“sport.”—B. S. (Q.).
If the Education Department wants
trainees it will have to go out after them.
Other branches of the P.S. have more
to offer, and, of course, private industry
is in the field for brains and ability. Of
40 boys securing creditable Leaving Cer-
tificate passes at one of our largest schools
last year not one turned to teaching.
This year, too, boys will sign on for
teaching only if their chances of success
are not bright in any other profession.—
K. V. (N.S.W.).
If .22 ammunition was the only means
of dealing with rabbits (B. 29/9/’4B)
we’d need a few million shooters to have
any effect. The only times I’ve seen a
cocky with pearifle or a shotgun it’s been
for sport. The farmer who really tries to
keep down rabbits, foxes, dingoes and
the like uses poison.— Long TJn (Vic.).
There are many reasons for the short-
age of nurses, but I agree with “Trained
Nurse” (B. 29/9/’4B) that attractive pub-
licity would get results. It should be
clearly advertised that domestic drudgery
is out, that pay, hours, conditions and
opportunities of advancement compare
more than favorably with most other
callings open to women. Chances of
travel after qualification are good, and
the calling carries with it a social status
equal to any in the community.—
C. B. M. (N.S.W.).
A campaign is afoot to eradicate t.b.
in 20 years, but the best institutions, X-
rays and treatment for all will never be
enough to stamp out the disease unless
the social side of the problem is dealt
with as well. The overcrowded houses of
“Hullo, dear —caught you in at last!"
today are directly responsible for the
spread of the disease from one member
of a household to another, and poor
home conditions can quickly destroy
health carefully built up over a long
period in hospital and sanatorium. Some
housing conditions are so grim that, even
with the present grave shortage of beds,
patients fit enough to go home are kept
in the institutions. Fresh air and separate
sleeping accommodation—necessities for
those who have once suffered from t.b. —
are impossibilities under the present
housing shortage.— Kemat (S.A.).
