For generations the practice of taking
Eno’s “Fruit Salt” first thing every morn-
ing has been the golden rule of healthy
living among sensible people*
Eno helps your system, in Nature’s
own way, to free itself regularly of its
daily waste, and sees to it that your
blood-stream is always clean and
vigorous* Leads to a fuller enjoy-
ment of every minute of your daily life*
And Eno does its work so pleasantly*
The idea that only unpleasant purga-
tive mineral salts can be good for you
has long been exploded* In this climate
nothing can really take the place of
Eno with its beneficial effect upon the
whole system*

Grey Hair is always taken to be a sign
of age or worry, and in a woman, especi-
ally if she be in early years, amounts to
a tragedy. A woman should never let
herself go. The signs of youth should
always be protected. The well-known
preparation, Dr. Allen’s Mexican Walnut
Stain, removes all trace of grey. It is
easy and safe to apply and can be done
in the privacy of the home.

An Immortal Chronicle
As an antidote to those epics of mud
and blood which rained upon us during
the “war literature” season comes War
Letters to a Wife (Medici). Their author,
Colonel Rowland Feilding, was a front-line
soldier. He wrote, not for the public, but
to enlighten his wife, from whom he had
promised to withhold nothing; and he
wrote while the events described were fresh
in mind, often actually on the battlefield
or in the trenches. As a result of the per-
fect understanding which must have existed
between the writer and receiver of these
letters we have the most unique chronicle
(Red Page continued on page 6.)

DAVID
JONES’
of sustained courage which war literature
has yet produced.
Colonel Feilding was in France, chiefly
as a battalion commander, from 1915 until
the -end of the war. In September, 1915,
as a company commander, he took part in
the Battle of Loos. His company gained
their objective, but found themselves with
their left flank “in the air.” The company
commander, therefore, set out with two
orderlies to find the Ist Brigade. Along the
road towards La Bassee four wounded Eng-
lishmen, who had lain two days in the
muddy ditch by the roadside, called out to
him. In spite of the wretchedness of their
position it was not about themselves that
they were concerned. They wanted to warn
him about a sniper who they said had
been shooting all the time they lay there
from a tree in front. It was dark; Feild-
ing proceeded with caution. Then, from
some bushes on the left, came groans as
if from a wounded man. Braving the pos-
sibility of being drawn into a trap, he
followed in the direction of the groans, and
came upon a dying German soldier; —
He sat propped up in a sniper’s pit—a grotesque
figure with his ridiculous pickelhauhe tilted over one
eye. As I approached he uttered some sort of
imprecation. I promised him that he should be
looked after. He was quite a lad, and so frail and
light, and his face so pale and artless as I lifted
him out of the pool of rain water in which he sat,
that it was hard to believe he had been engaged on
so dirty a trade. He died as I moved him, and I
left him lying by the edge of the pit from which
he had been sniping English soldiers....
All through the letters we get an insight
into the heart of a real soldier, and of an
officer intensely proud of his regiment and
of his men. For instance: —
At one place an arm and hand stuck out and
dangled across the trench. On one of the fingers
was a solid-looking gold ring, and in spite of the
fact that, owing to the narrowness of the passage,
each man that passed it had to brush the hand
aside, it spoke well for the battalion, I thought,
that to my knowledge the ring still remained un-
touched for more than 24 hours; and though in
the end it disappeared, I am convinced it was not
taken by any Coldstreamer....
Amidst all the beastliness of war he
found time to notice that the country be-
yond the trenches may be beautiful:—
Yesterday the whole scene had changed. The
fields were green with young corn, or yellow with
mustard, or crimson with clover. Woods and
plantations, the existence of which before I had not
noticed, sprung out in all directions, in masses of
luxuriant color. On the hills and in the valleys
villages now peeped out, which before I could not
see because of the rain; and the big winding
Somme graced all. In fact I discovered that the
country I had been living in for six weeks is
really very beautiful in Spring....
In September, 1916, Feilding, being appa-
rently too old for further promotion on
the regular establishment of the Guards
Division, was appointed to command the
6th Connaught Rangers. Out of all the
Englishmen on the Western Front one
could conceive no one more suitable. Yet
he had misgivings. Writing of this change
he says:—
I am of course on probation, and I have not an
easy task before me; therefore I shall require all
your prayers. What would I give for the oppor-
tunity of a few words with you! I have hated
having to make this great change
He came on his new battalion bivouacking
on a slope alongside the ruins of Carnoy,
amid a plague of flies. They were reduced
to 365 (other ranks), being fresh from the
capture of Guillemont. And within 24
hours of assuming command, with only a
slight knowledge of his officers, and none
at all of his men, he was ordered to move
his new Irish command up in front of
Ginchy. Writing of these Irishmen some
time later, he says:—
It is like living in a new world to be amongst
these Irishmen, so great is the contrast between
their national characteristics and those of the men
I have come from. Unlike some Irish battalions
this one is composed, practically entirely, of Irish-
men. They are, I should imagine, difficult to drive,
but easy to lead. They are intensely religious, loyal
to their officers, and, as every man is plainly out—
to the best of his capacity—to do whatever is
required of him, they are an exceedingly satisfactory
body of men to deal with, though, as yet, they have
comparatively little training....
Mrs. Feilding arranged for a number
of miniature crucifixes sufficient to be
worn by every man under her husband’s
command, to be blessed by the Pope, sent
out to France, and distributed to the Con-
naughts at a special parade mass. The
ceremony took place in the parish church
of Locre on April 22, 1917. At that mass
one thousand Irish soldiers prayed for the
“special intention” of their English colonel’s
wife, and afterwards the chaplain handed
out the crucifixes, first to the two generals
and then to every officer and man in the
battalion, who kissed them as they received
them, and afterwards hung them round their
necks.
Writing of the death of Willie Redmond
(brother of John), who died of wounds at
the age of 52, the Colonel remarks:—
How one’s ideas change! And how war makes
one loathe the party politics that condone and even
approve when his opponents revile such a man as
this! I classify him with Stephen Gwynne and
Harrison —all three, MEN —Irish Nationalists, too,
whom you and I, in our Tory schooling, have been
brought up to regard as anathema....
Later:—
Willie Redmond is buried in the Nuns’ Garden
(in the Convent at Locre), on almost the very
spot I had chosen for myself.... -
But behind and beyond these mere ex-
tracts lies the book itself—which can be
read and re-read with devouring interest.
The Colonel is no stilted English soldier—
nor parade-ground Guardsman. He is a
very human and lovable man who had to
wage his own war quietly with the brass-
hats; who does not believe in the infliction
of the extreme penalty for cowardice; and
who felt, when it was all over, that there
was a good deal to be said in favor of
trench life:—
There were none of the mean haunting fears of
poverty there, and the next meal —if you were
alive to take it—was as certain as the rising sun.
The rations were the same for the “haves” as the
“have-nots,” and the shells fell, without favor,
upon both....

DREAM THRALL.
Falstaffian mornings chuckle overhead
With elemental and Gargantuan mirth.
Blue, beauty-haunted dusks burn dim and
shed
Rose embers down to earth.
Brown sand is here and fronded forest ways,
Far from the civy’s hate and hopelessness
Where the street-cliffs, ' like Hell-hewn
Sphinxes, gaze,
Grey wardens of duress!
Life is earth’s laughter here, an ecstasy
Born of shrill spray-song and of silken
foam,
Tumult enshrining a tranquillity
The heart of me calls home.
The haunted _ heart, that needs must creep
from sight,
Poor blind fool, half-fearful of joy’s
gleams,
To glimpse again undazzled of delight
The dim grief of its dreams!
QUEENSLAND.

FRUSTRATION.
I know now were I to walk out over there,
Where is a lure of trees half lost in haze
And the voice of summer calling, I should
find
The heat of the road and weariness to spare
But no goal ever for the quest of the mind —•
A tedious journey still of countless days.
For yonder is not other than here at hand,
Though shapeless now with miles and
drenched with noon.
Pluck the miles off, as may be plucked and
strewn
These leaves —or those leaves when one
reaches them —
Houses are only houses in that land;
A tree has ordinary roots and stem.
It is a great loss to have learnt this thing;
There never can be the old lift of the heart
With the old hope, reborn, that an effort
made,
Some shrug of the body’s lethargy, might
bring
Distance to heel, might thrust the hills apart,
Oberon’s gateway, porch of masquerade.

Colin P.: Sorry, but we can’t print every
wise suggestion even. The best we can do is to
select from the mass the assortment that covers the
widest range.... Voice in Wilderness: For years
The B. has advocated that pre-selection should be
made a criminal offence... .T.J.: The B. didn’t
limit its relief to the primary producers “to a
measly 1 p.c.” What The B. proposed was that
interest on deposits should be cut by 1 p.c., which
would permit of a far larger reduction of interest
on rural advances... .J.W.S.: Mysterious message
baffled the office super-medium... .Cygnis Insig.: The
date and place of Jack London’s death were given
correctly... .D.C.: No money in “The Harvest”;
no gold in “The Sunrise”... .K.W.: Can’t say.
Many girls at that age write verse fairly freely.
The only “action to take” is to let her read the
best poets for a few years... .T. 5.8.: “Reason
leaves the man who tries to rhyme.” Well, you
said it.. ..M.C.: “Jesting Fate” failed to tickle
the cash-box open.... J.A.: All well off this target.
. ...G.T.: Good, but it’s been told before.
... .C.K.; No personal answers. Verse fairly well
done, but it lacks real feeling... .G.H.C.: Y'ou’ll
need to get a better control over your muse. She
bolts sideways... .Red C.: “It’s a happy thing
to be dead.” How happy most public speakers must
be!....Ground F.: Add your ray to the dawn:—
Alone she stands on the station,
O lonely girl of the Bush!
“Y'ou’ll be met by a relation,”
They told her; but only the rush
Of strangers catching their trains
. She sees; then, “Oh, James!”
She espies an old school-day friend of hers,
And happiness in her heart once more stirs.
. ...T.H.N.: Don’t spill so many beans in the open-
ing paragraph... .V.D.: Such characters never lived.
... .A.8.J.: There should be a job for you at the
weather bureau.... C.A.: You overstress the unim-
portant... .J.S.: Might pass if more carefully
written... .C.C.S.: A score of others have covered
the same ground... .1.E.8.: Worth elaborating
S.D.R.: A hopeless melodrama... .A. W.R.: Tiresome;
takes a Wells to handle a fantasy like that—.
E.R.8.H.: Unfortunately for Australia gold is not
found as easily as that.... R.C.: Well, who did
murder the hawker? T.M.: Conventional little
love yarn.... H.W.: What the surveyor said wasn’t
worth saying... .K.S.: Excellent description, but
poor story.. . .R.J.A.: Too reminiscent of a “Satur-
day Evening Post” yarn... .N.M.E.: Sort of stuff
a jilted youth might turn out after getting the ring
back... .L.L.C.: The coroner’s crime is unconvinc-
ing. . . .C.M.: A preposterous plot. .. .A.M.: Time
that bush fire burned itself out... .W.W.: There’s a
special corner in the w.p.b. for kind-hearted burglars.
Stade: Sony you have “failed to place it” at
so many addresses E.8.P.: Can’t find any mint
edge to “The Silver Lining” Crip: Regret to
damp your enthusiasm for the “bracing, uplifting
music of ‘The Red Flag,’ ” but Shaw said it was
like “the funeral march of a fried eel”....Vin-
jonted: No space for parodied nursery rhymes
Q.: Surprise endings get a bit obvious after the
first one A.S.E.: Another thing those responsible
for a depression will have to answer for is its
verse... .W.W.S.: Don’t like the look of the face
in the camp fire. The other is better, though it
misses by a yard or two G.E.F.: Once more
“Virtue” will have to be its own reward.... Pat -
roclus: Liked best the title of “The Closing Verses
of a Symposium of Souls: An Imaginary Excursion
to the Nether World”... .L.R.: No; but ‘you’ll do
better G.W.M.: The basket has ’em....V.G.: It
wasn’t... .M.F.: You’re right. Pity the verse isn’t
strong enough to carry it... . Onlooker: That fits
you, t 00... .Bellerive: You’ll comfort millions:—
RHYME OF A BALD HEAD.
On the subject of what
Gives a man a bald head
By professors of science
A lot has been said,
Such as mental worry,
Sickness and grief.
Yet many bald men
Laugh more than they weep.
To retain a few locks,
When all said and done,
Like half a loaf, is
Better than none.
(Next week: “Hypnotised.”)
... .0.W.: Reads too much like a treatise by a gun-
maker... .S.N.J.: Just a collection of hackneyed
phrases... .J.G.: Abridgement of “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin” with a back o’ Bourke setting... .N.S.D.:
Gave weeping heroine a handkerchief; then packed
her back to mother... .F.T.: It’ll be a tough job
to find a buyer for that class of stuff... .L.K.P.:
You retrace your steps too often... .G.L.: Not worth
more than half a column at the most... .E.P.: All
right for nursery consumption... .C.T.0.: Dull
description of dull courtship... .K.F.: Shortened
considerably it might get a look in... .R.H.S.:
Sincere but slight... .F.A.Q.: Won’t admit Australia
must go broke. Ten thousand businesses have been
in a worse state and pulled through—by doing
things, certainly, which the political parasites won’t
so far let Australia do.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
W. 8.: Your shipwrecked mariners won’t be allowed
to trouble the etchers W.H.D.: But they’re so
ordinary !... .J.K.: A ragged trio... .N.F.R.: In-
artistic, and the merest streak of humor... .W.K.:

Nag still running G.H.: You’re pretty brave
when you lift a joke from last week’s Bulletin.
Most pirates let a few years pass. .. .D.A.C.: Stiff.

TIME TO RECAST PARTIES.
In most countries until a few years ago
Governments interfered as little as possible
with private enterprise. Then, gradually,
as the Parliamentary franchise was ex-
tended, deeper incursions were made into
what was previously the field of the em-
ployer. Australia experimented further in
that direction than any other country in
the world. Its Labor party early adopted
“the socialisation of the means of produc-
tion, distribution and exchange” as a plank
in its platform; and, ostensibly to carry out
that policy, it borrowed enormously of the
capitalist to build anti-capitalist State
railways, workshops, roads, wharves and
docks and other industrial agencies. The
construction, maintenance and operation of
these called for a vast army of State
servants; and to deal with other employees
Industrial Courts were created and a basic
wage set up, governed not by what a man
could or did produce, but by what some-
body decided were his needs.
All this was very well so long as we
did not have to pay our way. For many
years we neither did it nor attempted to do
it. In all the years down to 1919 the States
had gone into debt to the extent of 397
millions. In the next ten years we almost
doubled that huge total. In the five-year
period 1918-23 the States alone borrowed
154 millions; in the next five years no less
than 177 millions. On top of that there is
a Commonwealth debt of about 400 mil-
lions. Approximately one-third of this
gross debt of over 1100 millions is wholly
unproductive; the other two-thirds is nomi-
nally productive, but in fact a great part
of it is in works which do not pay even
running expenses.
In Australia, therefore, the plans and
policies of Governments are of supreme im-
portance to private enterprise. Govern-
ments fix wages and hours of labor; they
control a great many of the instruments of
production and distribution such as rail-
ways and harbors; and they have almost
unlimited powers of taxation. They can,
in short, determine whether private enter-
prise shall carry on any business at all.
Until quite lately it was possible to fore-
cast the plans of either political party.
Labor had its platform, and Nationalism
or whatever else it might call itself its
plainly expressed intentions. Lately, how-
ever, things have been different, with Labor,
at all events. It is no longer a homo-
geneous party; with changing conditions it
has divided into groups, having some
general objects, no doubt, but differing
widely as to means. Indeed, the general aim
of most people in such a country as Australia
is a good deal the same. The average
Nationalist is just as anxious that the
worker shall be well fed, well housed and
well clad as the average Laborite is. So,
too, the desire of every one at the moment
is to get the unemployed back to produc-
tive labor and to restore the country s
prosperity. But what one Labor group says
will produce these results, another Labor
group sa3's will produce chaos. There is far
more difference between the Labor groups
on this point than there is between some
of the Labor groups and some of the
Nationalists.
The lines which have divided political
parties have never lasted long. Cavaliers
and Roundheads, Whigs and Tories, Con-
servatives and Liberals, Freetraders and
Protectionists, Liberal Reform and Labor,
Labor and Nationalist—the divisions have
had to change continually to meet changing
circumstances, and the time has come for
a re-alignment in Australia. The country
ought to know when this or that party
gets into power what general plans the
Government will follow. In practice it does
not now know anything of the sort. The
Scullin Ministry has been in Federal office
nearly 18 months, and not only does the
public not know its plans, it does not
know them itself. In N. S. Wales, Mr.
Lang has been Premier for four months,
and not his most trusted Minister —if he
has one—knows his intentions. The gov-
ernment of N. S. Wales might be for all
practical purposes in the hands of the Com-
munists, and the majority of Labor M’s.P.
be quite unaware of it. All they know
is that they have been called upon to
approve of various scraps of policy; and,
though they may have grave private doubts
about some of them, they are expected to
assume that Mr. Lang knows.
The suggestion that Mr. Lang is in the
hands of the Communists is not at all
ridiculous. In a State like N. S. Wales
anything in the shape of an armed Bol-
shevik Revolution would be out of the
question; “the proletariat” has too much
to lose, for one thing. So the obvious
Copamunist course is to gradually dispossess
those who have private capital and dis-
tribute it among the community. Every-
thing that Mr. Lang is doing is in that
direction. He is taking no steps to get
the unemployed to productive work; the
more unemployed there are and the more
they consume, the sooner will the pockets
of those with anything in them be emptied.
He told the Premiers at Canberra that he
was not going to lower wages—he had in-
creased them and was going to increase
them more. Meantime he shows no con-
cern about mounting public expenditure.
Mr. Lang may not be the agent of the
Communist Internationale; on that point it
is not at all likely that there could be any
evidence. All one can say is that Mr.
Lang’s policy could not better serve the
purposes of the Communists if it were
dictated from Moscow headquarters.
Yet Mr. Lang’s party is not a Communist
party—is, on the other hand, declared to
be anti-Communist. Further, it need not
be doubted that Mr. Lang has not done
a single thing in excess of his authority.
What this means is that it is possible under
the present Constitution for a policy entirely
agreeable to the Communists to be earned
out by a Labor Government notwith-
standing that a vast majority of the rank
and file of Labor may be wholly opposed
to Communism.
And much the same thing may take place
in the Federal sphere, where a policy of
camouflaged inflation may be fastened upon
the country in the teeth of a large section
of the Labor party itself and of almost the
whole body of public opinion outside that
party.
Democratic government has been dis-
carded; and we shall have no honesty or
sincerity until it is brought back. We
must take the power out of the hands of
the machines and the manipulators and
return it to the people. To that end there
must be a great increase in the use of the
referendum, including the recall; the public
service must be created into a constituency
of itself; and membership of any Parlia-
ment must be made much less of a prize
to sell the soul for. With these changes
made, party lines will readjust themselves.
At present they are used to fasten upon
the public policies which are the mere fads
of small, active minorities; and since the
business community does not know what
fad or succession of fads may be fastened
upon it, there is uncertainty and dread.
And, as we are finding out to-day, un-
certainty and dread mean inaction and un-
employment.
GOLD, LANG AND CROOKS.
At the outset the fear or professed fear
of the Labor party was that the worker
would be called upon to do all the suffering
in this financial crisis. When it was clearly
shown that there are few investments which
have not lost half their market value, that
hundreds of them are giving no return at
all, and that thousands of employers are
penniless, the ground was shifted. Some
capital, it was complained then, is getting
as large a return as ever; and as, by reason
of the fall in prices, money is worth a great
deal more than it was before prices fell,
these capitalists are actually benefiting by
what is distressing the rest of the com-
munity.
Now, that is all quite true. There are
certain people whose ' incomes are not
affected by a general fall in prices, and who
are consequently the gainers .when prices
do fall. And no doubt it is a bad thing
that they should gain. Bait we shall not
get over the difficulty by taking from them
their gains if we do not also relieve them
of their losses; and of that, of course, there
is no suggestion. Yet those losses can be
and have been very serious. In 1914 these
States owed 317 millions; the average inter-
est payable was £3 12s. 6d., and only one-
fifth of the principal was re-payable before
1920. In 1913 the index or price-level
figure was 1086. Between 1890 and 1913,
during which most of this money had been
borrowed, the average was 988. From 1913
onward there was a sharp rise, until in 1920
it was 2480; and down to last year the
lowest it has ever been since then was 1758
in 1922. Throughout this period from 1914
to 1929 inclusive, then, we had the use of
money borrowed in the days of low prices;
but we should have laughed at any sug-
gestion that the rate ought to be raised
because of the rise in prices during the
currency of the loan. What £9BB could buy
on the average between 1890 and 1913 it
required £1854 to buy on the average be-
tween 1914 and 1929; in other words, money
was worth not much more than half as
much. Yet it did - not occur to us to add
even 50 per cent, to the interest which we
were paying on old debts; and public ser-
vants who had retired before the war on
pensions and who tried to live on them in
the face of higher costs were not offered a
penny more by any Government, Labor or
otherwise.
That there should be these great varia-
tions in the purchasing power of money
is admittedly wrong; and all the economists
of any standing in the world realise it.
It has been their greatest problem for a
hundred years at least. At this moment an
international body of tremendous tonnage
is seeking to find a way by which the
irregularities may be avoided. It may be
that the gold supply of the world is not a
sufficient basis for the world’s currency,
even if it were all used for that purpose.
That, of course, is no new suggestion. But
it is not its insufficiency so much as its
irregularity which causes the trouble. Be-
tween 90 and 100 years ago the world was
complaining of the scarcity of gold and the
consequent lowness of prices: that was the
period when Australia met its first great
financial trouble, culminating in the failure
of the Bank of Australia. Yet before 15
years had passed, so great had been the
flood of gold from California and our own
diggings, that leases made in the City of
London gave the owner the right to demand
payment in silver.
A completely self-contained country has
no need to worry about the gold standard.
It can set up any standard it chooses —
cocoanuts, greenstone, skins, the bleached
skulls of politicians. But the moment it
trades outside, the moment it has to make
or receive payments, there must be a
medium agreed on by both parties. Mr.
Lang, addressing the Premiers’ Conference,
mentioned a “goods standard.” This is
quite feasible and would answer all purposes
if Mr. Lang could get all the nations of
the earth with which we trade to agree upon
it. Mr. Lang may have a little difficulty
however, with the U.S.A. and France and
Britain—also Italy and Holland and Ger-
many and a few others. It is not quite
clear how he will get along in arranging
a common “goods” standard even with
Russia.
The simple fact of the matter is that
Mr. Lang, hotly pursued by ravenous unem-
ployed, must have a good and constant sup-
ply of herrings to drag across his track;
and the gold standard will do for one as
well as anything. To everyone with any
knowledge of the subject it is obvious, how-
ever, that any quick change in the standard
is utterly impossible, no matter how
desirable it may be; and until a change is
made we must take the .variations as they
come. Certainly, after claiming for our-
selves the benefit of every rise, to deny to
our creditors the benefit of any fall might
appeal to a gang of crooks, but would be
repugnant to everybody else.
And the public would gain nothing by it.
In London and the U.S.A. at the present
moment N. S. Wales stocks are being sold
at a price which gives the investor over
1(H- per cent. p.a. This is the result of a
mere suggestion that Mr. Lang might reduce
the rate of interest, etc. Once let it be
understood that there is any risk about
these Government stocks, and the price
goes up. So, even if Mr. Lang could cut
down the rate of interest, and was dishonest
enough to do it, we should gain nothing,
for the rate would be pushed up on
all our renewals, if we could get renewals
at all.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Is It a Depression At All?
Behind most of the schemes which the poli-
ticians put forward is the idea that these
times are not normal. Man is so prone to
believe what he wants to believe that few
recognise in what we have lately gone
through a wild boom; we prefer to regard
the conditions of the 10 years 1919-29 as
average, and our descent from them as an
accident from which in due time we shall
recover. The politician thinks, therefore,
his mission is to make a bridge over what
he conceives to be a gulf.
Wickens has an index-figure table show-
ing average wholesale prices of all com-
modities in Melbourne since 1861. That
was a year closely following the tremendous
gold discoveries, when boom conditions pre-
vailed and prices were high in consequence.
In the year 1861 it would have needed
£1538 to buy a unit of all commodities in
Melbourne. Beginning at that point the
figure has moved in 10-year periods as fol-
lows :
1861 .. £1538 I 1901 .. £974
1871 .. 1229 | 1911 .. 1000
1881 .. 1121 | 1921 .. 1903
1891 .. 945 I 1930 .. 1532
After the output from the new gold rushes
had eased off, prices gradually got back to
normal; and by 1871 the index-figure was
down to 1229. For 44 years thereafter,
down to 1915, it never again reached that
figure, and for the greater part of the
period it was well below 1000. In 1913 it
was 1086; in 1914 (the war year) it was
1149; in the next year it had sprung to
1604. This clearly shows that the war is
entirely responsible for the high prices of
this period 1915-29. As with every large
cause the effects did not die away immedi-
ately the event was passed: in the case of
the gold rushes of the ’fifties we have seen
how the price boom lasted well into the
’sixties and had not lost all its force even in
1871.
Though the descent has been very rapid
in the present case, it has not yet reached
the average level of the 45 years preceding
the war. The figure for 1930 in the table
above is as at September of that year: if
there has been a fall of 50 points since then,
the level would still be 50 per cent, above
the average of the 40 years prior to the war.
It does not follow, certainly, that price-
levels will get down to where they were
before the war. On the other hand there
is no good reason why they should not do
so, costs of production of most things having
been so tremendously reduced. On the
figures nothing could be clearer, at any
rate, than that what we have just passed
through has been a boom, produced by a
definite cause which no longer exists, and that
present figures are much above normal,
assuming normal to be the average con-
ditions over a long period unaffected by
special circumstances. .

An SOS to Britain.
Ip it has not been done already the British
Government should be informed now that
we shall soon have to throw ourselves on
its mercy and ask for help. The position
ought to be, and in certain respects is,
improving materially. Our imports were
£24,679,118 more than our exports in the
first seven months of the 1929-30 financial
year; in the first seven months of the cur-
rent financial year our exports were
£5,419,634 more than our imports. But,
while our imports have been worked down
to the extent of 34 millions, the stunning
falls in the markets for our staples have
reduced our exports by 23 millions com-
pared with the corresponding months of
the previous year, notwithstanding all our
efforts to increase them —and there were
very substantial efforts.
On that side, everything considered, we
have made quite satisfactory progress. But
because our Governments, with one or two
exceptions, have utterly failed to get the
position in hand, our budgets threaten to
be more unbalanced than ever. In the
Commonwealth sphere there has been noth-
ing but the most appalling incompetence,
resulting in a deficit for the first seven
months of the financial year of £11,487,000.
For every 20s. which the Government has
spent during the period it has collected only
13s. 2d. Income tax and other collections
should improve during the next five months;
but the year’s deficit can scarcely be less
than 12 millions, and may be more. Every
State is in much the same position, deficits
for the seven months being as follows:
New South Wales . . . • £6,073,655
Victoria . . ■ • • • 4,533,981
South Australia • • • • 2,039,385
Queensland . . • . • •
Westralia . . • • • • h o6 !’.
Tasmania • ■ • • • • 208,143
£15,486,974
Commonwealth .. • • 11,487,000
Total deficit .. . • £26,973,974
There is a pretty general idea that any
Government can have a deficit. It cannot.
A Government can have a deficit in only
two ways: (1) by not paying its wages,
salaries and other debts; (2) by borrowing
to pay, and that, of course, is quite different
from borrowing for public works. Thus tar
we have not managed to either pay or arrange
for all our current bills, and N. S. Wales
would have defaulted the other day when
an interest bill fell due had not the Loan
Council come to its rescue. But the Loan
Council hag no funds other than those
which Commonwealth and States can
supply or which it can borrow from the
banks through the Commonwealth Bank.
Those institutions, as The Bulletin has
shown again and again, are drained dry
dangerously dry in some cases. To carry us
through last year we had borrowed here
and there, wherever we could find temporary
accommodation, approximately 30 millions.
Our own banks can only go further ay
squeezing private customers harder even than
some of them have been already forced to
do. Meantime we are trusting completely
to others to pay our bills for us; and that
must stop very soon now—stop just as in-
evitably as borrowing for public works had
to stop. We are being carried on only
to save us from the financial debacle which
default would bring about our ears—and no
doubt our creditors’ ears also. . . ,
If we have not already notified the British
Government that it may hear our bOb at
any time, we should do it without fuithe
delay. What it will mean nobody know..
But presumably the relief which no dou ■
the British Government will have to give
will be accompanied by terms. The sooner
we know what they are the better.


The Farmers’ Debts.
The Federal Government turned down the
proposal to help the wheat-farmer by col-
lecting a sales tax on flour and giving him
the proceeds because its supporters allegedly •
objected to pay a farthing more for bread;
and though the party loved the farmer
much, it loved its own job more. With its
customary weakness, the Government has
accepted instead a scheme whose great
merit is that somebody else will have to
pay for it. On Parker Moloney’s motion the
Federal and State Governments have
agreed to raise a loan of six millions, 3i
millions of it to be paid out by way of a
bounty of 6d. per bushel of the past harvest,
and 2i millions to be lent to the States
for assisting necessitous farmers. The loan,
it is suggested, should be repaid out of
revenue by instalments spread over 10 years.
Of course something must be done for
the farmer, and not the wheat-farmer only :
he may have bought unwisely, but his
country needs him almost as badly as it
needed men in 1914-18. And it has to be
remembered that he is in his present dis-
tressful position very largely because he
rallied to the Australian Government’s call
of a year ago to “grow more wheat!”—a
call in which The Bulletin impenitently
confesses it joined and which it just as
impenitently repeats: “Grow more wheat!”
But in thousands of cases it cannot be done
without help; and the question arises
whether the help proposed is the best even
if the loan can be raised.
The Bulletin proposes, therefore, that
the Commonwealth Government should take
over such of the debts of the farmers as
have been incurred bona fide and are reason-
able, other than mortgages and the like;
that these debts —mostly for stores and
plant—should be valued and written down;
that the farmer should give a lien over his
crop for the repayment of the loan (to the
amount of the written-down value of the
debt) by 10 annual instalments, with 4i
per cent, interest, with the right of pre-pay-
ment; the farmers’ creditors to be paid their
written-down debts with bonds carrying
4 per cent, (or, if the Government has the
money, they could be paid cash); the bonds
to be negotiable in payments made to a
wholesale trader or a bank only.
The scheme adopted by the Premiers
will not rid the farmer of debts which
are hanging over him now and have been
accumulating for years unless the 2\ mil-
lions earmarked for necessitous farmers
is earmarked for the purpose; and
if there is no general Scheme for dealing
with these debts they will not be valued
and written down. Many of them would
not be worth Is. in the £ if payment
was pressed for now; and when a man
gets into that position he is greatly tempted
to walk off the farm. Why, he asks, should
he toil for years to shift a dead horse? The
scheme suggested will remove the dead
horse and give the oppressed farmer a
chance. And even though the debts are
written down hard, since the farmer is kept
on his farm his storekeeping creditor will
certainly be in a better position than he
occupies to-day.

The Premiers’ Latest Agreement.
The Premiers have come to still another
agreement. This time the main object seems
to be to fob off the Commonwealth Bank
and probably the other banks.
In response to the Treasurers’ clamor for
more money, the Commonwealth Bank re-
plied, in effect, that the security wasn’t
good enough and wouldn’t be good enough
until there were “adequate and equitable
reductions in all wages, salaries and allow-
ances, pensions, social benefits of all kinds,
interest and other factors which affect the
cost of living.” “This necessitates,” the
chairman wrote to the Federal Treasurer,
“some definite movement and constructive
plans.” Whereupon the Premiers adopted
a series of resolutions which for the most
part are no more than vague and pious
longings. The one definite thing in what
otherwise is a smoke-screen to hide the
politicians’ cowardice and inactivity is a
notification that “there will be a flat rate
of Commonwealth income tax of 3s. 6d.
in the £, without rebate, on interest on all
Commonwealth and State loans which are
subject to Federal income tax and on the
securities of local government bodies: this
tax to replace the recent Commonwealth
super tax of Is. 6d. in the £.” Further, there
is to be “rigid economy,” though in the
opinion of the Treasurers, of course, there
already is nothing else; and “the Govern-
ment and banks are to co-operate in making
adequate provision for the rehabilitation of
industry and restoration of employment.”
It all amounts to a series of resolutions
to which it is not possible to conceive of a
board of competent business men setting
their hands. As a general statement of
aspirations it might pass if drawn up after
a preliminary half-hour’s discussion: as the
conclusions reached after days of discus-
sion it is contemptible, and strengthens
this paper’s opinion, already expressed, that
little or nothing is to be hoped for from
these politicians.
From whom then? Well, possibly the
banks and other great financial institutions
should take the lead. The banks alone
have many millions of deposits which the
vacillation and ineptitude of the politician
is gravely imperilling. Mr. Lang, as might
have been expected, demanded to know
what right the Commonwealth Bank or any
other bank had to tell the Governments what
they should do. The answer is quite plain.
These banks, like every other . institution
and person, have a complete right to say
on what terms they will make advances
to the Government. Thus far they have
hesitated to put the matter as bluntly as
the case demands. But when the Trea-
surers of the Commonwealth and the
largest State propound policies which send
the price of N.S.W. 6 per cents, toppling
from £B2 to £7l in one week and Common-
wealth 5 per cents, from £76 ss. to £6B 10s.,
while Canadian 5 per cents, are at £lOO 55.,
it is surely time the guardians of the pub-
lic’s savings were heard from very definitely.

Demos Asiaticus.
At a time when Western publicists, from
H. G. Wells upwards, are engaged in de-
stroying the whole basis of democratic
theory, the statesmen of “the East” are
busy applying the most extreme doctrines
of democracy to their subject hordes. The
dictatorship which is at the moment ruling
China has as its ultimate aim the establish-
ment of that form of democratic govern-
ment of which the West is no longer proud;
although even the most optimistic Western
democrat never visualised a general election
for a population of 400 millions. The Simon
Commission found that India had not the
vestige of a desire for democratic institu-
tions or even an elementary understanding
of them; yet it decided that the only cure
for the country’s ills was a strong draught
of democracy. At the next elections in
Japan approximately 13 million women will
clatter on their geta to the polls to record
their husbands’ wishes.
In every direction social unrest due to
the weakening of Government authority is
met by a further giving away of govern-
mental power. In Mongolia, Turkestan and
every country bordering on the Soviet Re-
public so-called socialistic Governments
have replaced the autocratic rule of Living
Buddhas and tribal chieftains. How little
the populations concerned are ready for an
innovation for which the advanced democ-
racies of Europe are yet unprepared is
shown by the way the loin-clothed socialist
has amended and adapted the Western creed
to his mystical needs. In India Gandhi is
regarded as a god. In China the reverence
for the late Dr. Sun’s
Three Principles is
indistinguishable from
the ancient worship
of the Son of Heaven.
With bishops
preaching birth con-
trol and dictators
bobbing up every-
where in Europe, it
is just possible that
100 years hence the
student of compara-
tive religion and
democratic institu-
tions will have to go
east of Suez for the
latest information.

Newspaper Changes
in Sydney.
Ax a meeting of
Associated News
shareholders in Syd-
ney last week it was
decided to drop the
“Guardian” and “Pic-
torial” morning news-
papers, and resurrect
the old “Daily Tele-
graph” ; .what is to
be done with the
“Evening News” re-
mains to be settled.
Associated News a
year ago paid £575,000
in money and shares
for the “Guardian”;
and, though it may be
said that there will
now be nothing to
show for the money,
at least the removal
of an active competi-
tor gives the resur-
rected “Daily Tele-
graph” a better chance
to live.
From the national
viewpoint the changes
are to be welcomed,
even though they do
come by way of finan-
cial disaster. The old
“Daily Telegraph”
was at its best a very
fine journal; it chal-
lenged the “S. M.
Herald” and at some
points beat it. Then
came the war and a
disruption of ideas, in
the course of which
those who had ac-
quired control of the
“Telegraph” decided
that the world was no
longer serious enough
to want newspapers
of the old solid type,
but demanded that
the presses should
work to the tune of
the jazz. And because
Associated News had
somewhat similar
ideas and a much more confident organisa,-
tion, it added the poor jazz-and-cocktail
variation of the “Telegraph” to its gradu-
ally lengthening string.
Nobody knows what will happen when
the world recovers. For the present, being
sick, it inclines to be a saint. So there may
be more hope for a resurrected “Telegraph,”
sober and in its right mind, than there was
for the abandoned “Guardian” and “Pic-
torial,” whose place it takes. And it cer-
tainly ought to have more hope. Far too
great a proportion of the press during the
past 12 or 15 years has been pandering to
the vices and encouraging the weaknesses of
a war-shocked generation. Far too small a
proportion has cried out against that public
and private extravagance which finally
landed us, as they all should have known it
would, in national disaster. It would be
a tragedy if any paper which did a great
public duty during those years of war-
reaction went out of existence because of it:
in this case there has been no such tragedy.
Those newspapers which cling to the older
traditions will find a good deal of comfort
and encouragement from the' course that
events have taken.

Another Death Dredge.
The Sydney Harbor Trust, needing an
extra dredge some years ago and being in
a more than ordinarily frugal frame of mind
for those days, bought a second-hand one
from Hongkong. By good luck it got to Syd-
ney, and recently, at the age of 34, was sold
Ur £7OOO or so to a Harbor Trust in Tas-
mania. The poor old barge set out for its
new home under its own steam, with a
fishing launch as convoy to pick up the
crew in case it foundered. Both of them
got as far as Jervis Bay, where the dredge
had to run for shelter, the sea being rough.
Some members of the crew went ashore and
stayed there. They didn’t like the way the
old ark was behaving. The skipper, however,
battled on and got to Cape Everard, where
he found he was running short of coal; so
he turned back to Twofold Bay to fill
bunkers. Some more of the crew left, and
the dredge crawled back to Sydney.
Undaunted by this experience it was de-
cided to have the poor old dodderer
towed to Tasmania. For some reason not
hard to guess, another master had to be
found, and ten other men were induced to
go aboard. When nearing its destination
the barge sprang a leak, and five minutes
later capsized and sank. The captain and
mate were drowned; the others were
rescued by the tug.
How many more lives are to be lost be-
fore we prevent the ocean voyaging of
dredges, new or old? They are not built
for long cruises; their enormously heavy
top-gear makes them a menace to life in
rough weather, and they have killed far too
many Australians. Somebody ought to go
to gaol if there is any more of it.

Married Female Teachers.
“Dominie”: The retention of married-
women teachers is not the unmixed
advantage they would have us believe. Last
year I taught beside a married-woman
teacher, a graduate, whose husband, also a
teacher, drew a very fair salary. She had
, four children and was an excellent mother;
so good, in fact, that when any of the
children was off color she never hesitated
to stay at home and shepherd her child
back to health. All very fine; but during
these many absences I had to take on her
class as well as my own, and found the
task of adequately teaching a hundred
children quite impossible. Therefore for
many weeks during the year a hundred
children were sacrificed in order that our
married-woman teacher might play her
proper role as mother to one of her own
brood.
At- another school where I taught there
was a married-woman teacher whose hus-
band earned a good salary. During the
five years this woman taught there she gave
birth to three children. She attended fairly
up to within a week or so of the birth of
each child, but subsequently her absences
were always frequent as the babies
developed infantile troubles.
Yet there are 500 trained students who,
under present conditions, are unable to find
positions in the N. S. Wales State schools!

THIS YEAR.
If ever it was necessary for the man of limited means to conserve carefully and to spend wisely,
it is now. In most cases incomes are lower, and in many outgoing is greater, and consequently
reduced margins must be provided for.
True Thrift is not only the hoarding of money —it is just as much a matter of careful, useful
spending, but obviously the saving must come first.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Mitchell, of Westralia, said the other day
that if the Commonwealth inflated the cur-
rency or if N. S. Wales defaulted, his State
would secede; and Slang’s comment is re-
ported to have been “That’ll do me.” West-
ralia’s imports from N. S. Wales in the last
pre-slump year were valued at. £3,870,000;
w-itbout the Navigation Act they would
shrink to nothing. So Slang in his political
megalomania is prepared to sacrifice this
Splendid trade, in addition to breaking up
the Commonwealth and wrecking N.S.W.’s
finances and destroying its good name!
Hogan has been carpeted by the Melbourne
Trades Hall bosses for behaving like a
Premier when he was expected to- be a worm.
He defended himself stoutly, and it must
have been discovered that he was not friend-
less ; anyhow the meeting adjourned till

selection ballots (such as Disney, M.L.G., is
getting now) may shake the loyalty of some
of the Premier’s supporters in Caucus. It
is even said that he himself may be refused
endorsement; but a Trades Hall blatherskite
would have a poor chance in Warrenheip.
An inflationist was sentenced to a
week’s imprisonment and a fine of £3O in
Melbourne the other day. And it was only
milk he had watered down, not the nation’s
currency.
A pair of gold-hunters at Beeehworth
(Vic.) had a practical lesson in political
economy when they sold 220 z. gold for £lll
18s. 9d. This was a fraction over £5 per
ounce, and 15s. and a fraction per ounce
more than the price quoted the same day
in London. The difference wasn’t connected
in any way with the gold bonus either. It
is a muddled and lamentable fact that, just
when gold is fetching such a fancy price
(in depreciated currency, of course), Lang,
of N.S.W., who strikes attitudes as an Aus-
tralian dictator, wants to depose the long-
standing metal as a measure of value, and
persuade the world to replace it with other
things—tin and dried cowdung, among them.
The Mungana civil action for damages, in
which two Queensland ex-Premiers, Theo-
dore and McCormack, are among the four
defendants, may come on in May or it may
not arrive till June. The defendants have
still two months in which to lodge their
defence, if they like to take full advantage of
the possibilities. After that there may be
interrogatories, and assorted pleadings, and
applications for the discovery or conceal-
ment or obfuscation of documents, so there
is no assurance of speed. If Theodore and
his old colleague had only appeared before
Justice Campbell, which they could have
done without any risk of criminal prosecu-
tion, and given an unvarnished and convinc-
ing account of their innocence, what an
immensity of bother it would have saved!
In. the revolt of the people against the
politicians pre-selection is one of the swindles
that will have to be swept away; mean-
time the party bo'sses have been putting their
brand. 4 on candidates for East Sydney. The
Nationalists have “selected” L. T. Courtenay,
a former Sydney alderman and Labor con-
scriptionist, though they could have had men
with a wider appeal—Keith Smith, the avia-
tor, for instance, or M. A. Noble, who is
quite an interesting writer and speaker, ancl
was associated with East Sydney during his
great days as cricketer. The A.L.P. execu-
tive has picked Alderman Ward, and —brush-
ing aside Scullidore and the three-year-plan
—has instructed him to support Lang’s
“policy,” commanding Beasley at the same
time to open the campaign. Alderman Ward
is described as “a pledged supporter of Mr.
J. S. Garden,” and Mr. J. S. Garden is a
pledged supporter of Stalin, boss of the Red
Repudiationists, so a blessing from Moscow
may be expected at any moment.
The Sydney A.L.P. executive, of which
J. J. Graves is chairman, asserts that Lang’s
threat to refuse payment of interest on
N.S.W. loans, in Britain and to limit Aus-
tralian creditors to 3 p.c. p.a. is “the only
statesmanlike and sane policy yet
advanced by any of the responsible
political leaders.” Yet it is obvi-
ously only an extension of what is
known on the racecourse as “scal-
ing.” There is a queer fashion
in N. S. Wales of describing wagers
as “investments” even solemn
journals like the “S. M. Herald”
and functionaries like the Auditor-
General habitually refer to money
risked on the tote as “invested.”
If Mr. Graves, who was at the
races last Saturday, had “invested”
£lO on Promptitude at 5 to 1 and
had been offered £5 on going to col-
lect, or if he had been told he would
have to whistle for his money until
times improved or until the A.J.C.
altered its betting regulations in
the Ring’s favor, Mr. Graves would
have passionately denounced the
bookie as a “scaler” and sent for
the racecourse detective. Years
ago a “scaler” was kicked to death
at Flemington by much the same sort of
people who now clamor for political scaling
on a colossal scale.
South Aus. is to have an Assembly by-
election in circumstances without precedent
in Australia. Edwards, one of the three
members for Adelaide, and long identified
with prison reform, is by the terrible irony
of events, unless the verdict can be upset on
appeal, to go to prison himself. He stood
in the dock at the week-end and heard a
jury pronounce him guilty of an unspeakable
offence. During the long trial even political
opponents were heard to express the hope
that a career marked by many creditable
actions would not be ruined irretrievably.
The Hogan Government could save a few
pounds on its free litigation department. Two
young men found guilty of receiving stolen
goods admitted a long list of previous con-
victions. They were defended free of charge
by the Government solicitor who performs
this service for supposedly necessitous
persons.
“I do not put my ear to the ground to
ascertain which side is the most popular,”
Scullin told a Melbourne audience with
every appearance of virtuous indignation the
other day. It’s hardly necessary, anyhow,
in an age of long-distance telephones. The
fact remains that the Priminister, before de
parting for England, pledged his Government
to carry out the Melbourne agreement, and
said on his return that it could no-t be carried
out. If the change of front wasn’t due to his
having ascertained which way the wind was
blowing in Caucus, what was it due to?
Since the war only one Federal Labor
member, the veteran Higgs, has left the
party; now Gabb, M.11.R. for Angas (S.A.),
is following suit, and the complaint may be
catching. “The inclusion of Mr. Theodore

in the Ministry,” said Gabb the other day,
“is something more than I can swallow.”
Forde, now Minister for Customs, wrested
Capricornia from Higgs in 1922, but Gabb
will be harder to shift.
South Africa is feeling the slump as well
as Australia, but it has a different breed of
politicians. Farmers are to be helped with
Land Bank advances secured by second mort-
gages on crops and stock, and civil servants
are warned to prepare for drastic retrench-
ment. On the railways alone expenditure is
to be cut half a million. There are 13,500
miles of Government lines, nearly all on the
3ft. Gin. gauge.

Vic. Charities Board is, divided on the
question of urging the Hogans to establish
a lottery like the Golden Casket, and the
chapels naturally object. Premier Hogan is
non-committal about it. Minister Beckett,
who reported on the Queensland way
of helping hospitals and charities, made
no recommendation, contenting himself with
saying that the facts supplied “food for
thought.” He, however, seemed to be
delighted when the executive of the Country
Hospitals Association declared itself pro-
lottery.
Priminister Forbes is grasping the depres-
sion nettle with both hands. His proposals
include a 10 per cent, cut in salaries of
Ministers, members and all public servants;
non-political control of the railways; relief
work at reduced pay; increased income tax,
customs and excise duties; higher railway
and postal charges, and economies in rail-
way and education expenditure. The Maori-
land income tax is a trifle compared with
Australia’s heap of imposts, so the Dominion
can stand a bit more. And there is plenty
of room for economy in railway expenditure,
especially as branch lines, built for political
purposes, have never paid for axle-grease.
But the Post and Telegraph Department is
showing a substantial profit on the present
scale, and Maoriland and Australian experi-
ence is that higher charges conspicuously
fail to realise revenue anticipations.
The broadcasting through the wide world
of an address by the Pope gave Marconi,
now a marquis, an opportunity to spread
himself as the inventor who made the per-
formance possible. He is reported as having
said that “for 20 centuries the voice of the
Pope had been heard in the Vatican, but
this was the first time it had been
heard beyond its confines.” The statement
was a trifle inaccurate, for the first Pope
started 1890 years ago; moreover, he
and most of his successors didn’t live in
the Vatican —in fact, some of them didn’t
even live in Italy—so their voices were
naturally heard outside the historic edifice.
But a scientist of Marconi’s size needn't
worry much about small historical details,
and a scrap of blarney is always acceptable.
A straw blew across the Cabbage Garden
lately when Healesville Shire Council dis-
pensed with its secretary and engineer.
There was no money in the locker, and the
bank would pay no more cheques. A better
plan would have been to share officers with
three or four neighboring councils, retrench-
ing them by degrees, so to speak. There are
far too many such officers, and their salaries,
etc., run away with a large slice of the
rates.
Whenever Federal Cabinets are being
formed or reconstructed, something is
sure to be heard of the desirability of
every State being represented. And, of
course, nowadays every State gets represen-
tation of some sort, although it wasn’t so
easy when there were only eight jobs to fill;
a small State might be left outside in the
early days. George Reid, when he selected
his colleagues in 1904, was desolated to find
that he had no room for a Westralian Rep.
or Senator in his little lot. But that State
shouldn’t be the- loser thereby, the stout
diplomatist announced; he himself would
make its interests his special care. It didn’t
matter much, anyway, for George lasted less
than four months.
Parker Moloney, fresh, from his trip round
the world, said that he found conditions in
every country he had visited just about as
bad as in Australia, but that the difficulties
and troubles of other countries didn’t get
the publicity that ours were receiving. If
this is so, possibly one explanation is that
responsible Ministers in other countries
don’t go up and down tearing their hair
and cursing the banks that won’t advance
them money, or advising “Default and be
Damned” as their pet specific for dealing
with outside creditors.
Federal Labor asserted at the last general
election, and also at those of 1928, 1925,
1922 and 1919, that Australia could be
cheaply and efficiently defended by means of
aeroplanes and submarines, and it did away
with compulsory military training, in the
very limited form then existing, as soon as
it got the chance. It also continued the
Bruce policy of laying up cruisers and
destroyers without replacing them, until the
it.A.N. was reduced to a remnant of its
once proud self. Now the Scullidores are
returning the two remaining submarines to
the Royal Navy on the ground that the cost
of keeping them in commission is prohibi-
tive, and their leader admitted at the Pre-
miers’ conference that they had found the
air arm the dearest of all methods of
defence. So the defence “policy” of these
flustered amateurs is a confessed failure. It
is nevertheless their sacred duty to “protect
every State against invasion and domestic
violence,” and Jimmy Mitchell, as Premier
of the most distant and most dissatisfied
State, might very appropriately remind them
of the fact.
By regulation under Queensland’s Unem-
ployment Relief Act, the tax of 3d. in ths
£ (Slang’s is a shilling) is now to be levied
on “actors, actresses, members of choruses,
musicians, vocalists, entertainers, profes-
sional pedestrians, cyclists, speedway riders
and participants in boxing and wrestling
contests or exhibitions.” No opposition is

expected except in the case of boxing pro-
moters ; they contend that as the deduction
of the impost involves certain risks, the tax-
gatherers ought to collect it themselves.
The Commonwealth “Year-Book” contains
a chronological table of the chief events in
our history. This is the entry for 1911
First Federal census. Transfer of Northern Terri-
tory. Introduction of compulsory military training.
Launch of Commonwealth destroyer Warrego in
Sydney. Establishment of penny postage to all
parts of the British Empire.
Another Federal census is due this year, but
it has been abandoned on the plea of
poverty, though the Government can find mil-
lions for State speedways and pick-and-
shovel jobs. After 20 years of squander-
mania, the population of the N.T. has
dwindled to a trifle over 3000 (it was nearly
9000 in South Australia’s time) ; and to
show their contempt for the Government .the
Bolshevists of Darwin recently occupied its
representative’s verandah and hung a red
flag there, till the police removed it and
them. Compulsory military training has
gone, and nearly half the army with it.
The fighting ships of the R.A.N. have been
reduced to two cruisers and a destroyer, and
it is persistently reported that these are to
be placed under British control, like the two
submarines. And postage has gone back to
twopence. Yet the guilty and incapable
politicians, so far from being contrite, are
more cocksure than ever. The noisiest push
wants to “nationalise banking,” and monkey
with the currency, and “default and be
damned.”

“R. Volt”: Behind the bare announce-
ment that direct automatic cable communi-
cation has been estab-
lished between Aus-

a story 'of ceaseless
experiment and mas-
terly engineering. The
problem was entirely
different from that
which confronted the
beam people. With the
beam there are roughly
only two sets of in-
struments to be kept
in adjustment—the re-
ceiving and the send-
ing. In the case of
the cables there are at
least 15 sets situated
in places of such dif-
ferent climatic condi-
tions as Cottesloe

bo, Gibraltar and
Porthcurno (Corn-
wall) . The slightest
failure to standardise
the myriad operations
required to send a dot

will result in a mutila-
tion, and that mutila-
tion will be faithfully
repeated by all the
succeeding inst r u-
ments. This direct
communication was
only made possible by
the use of the most
sensitive instruments,
exquisitely synchro-
nised and protected by
all sorts of devices
from outside interfer-
ence, which might
take the form of trams
in Suez or tropical
thunderstorms in the
middle of the Indian
Ocean. In the old days, when a cruder
method of relaying was employed, one of
our chief worries was a spider, almost
too minute to be seen by the naked eye,
which had a penchant for nesting in sus-
pended coils. In terms of relativity that
spider would be an elephant if it got in
amongst the present instruments.

“Tee Essbie”: The Parkes electorate isn’t
inaptly named (B. 4/2/’3l). One of
the pioneers of the district was Thomas
Parkes, who in 1826 took up 50 acres of land
where Earlwood now is. The district sur-
rounding his holding was called Parkestown
after him until about 16 years ago, when
a local referendum altered the name to Earl-
wood. Thomas had 18 children; a grand-
son, Thomas Peak (or Sparkes), attained
some celebrity in his day as Australia’s
champion boxer. He went to England and
continued his victorious career until at last
he came up against Nat Langham, the only
man who ever beat Tom Sayers. It took
Langham 67 rounds to dispose of Peak; the
Australian only gave in when his arm was
broken.
“Brass-rag”: If the word may be men-
tioned in connection with such a tragedy,
there is a touch of humor in the announce-
ment that the Commander of 11.M.5.
Veronica is to be court-martialled for ground-
ing his ship at Napier. The grounding was due
to the lifting of the sea bottom, and not to
any error of seamanship, but naval tradi-
tions must be preserved; though the verdict
is a foregone conclusion, all the usual flum-
mery will be adhered to. The army, hide-
bound enough in many particulars, is more
sensible than the senior service. The question
of a court-martial is left to the discretion of
the senior officer commanding, instead of
being the inevitable consequence of any mis-
hap, however impossible to guard against

joint any night he likes to have

for ecarte, I should hesitate to
describe it as one of the best of
the two-handed games. The
element of luck involved in hold-
ing the king of trumps gives the
holder too strong an advantage
in either declaring or conceal-
ing the master card. To my
mind, and I have played both
games since childhood, there is
no two-handed card game to
compare with piquet—the chess
of the card-table, as I have

“Spankhurst”: One of the
quaintest exhibitions London
has seen for some time is a dis-
play of suffragette relics held
to commemorate the 25th anni-
versary of the release from gaol
of the first batch of women who
defied the law to emphasise
their claim for votes. Famous
stones and historical hammers
used for smashing windows
were among the relics, as were
pieces of the more notable
windows. Two of these last,
cut out from their frames in a
cell window with a diamond
ring by an incarcerated suf-
fragette, were on show in chaste
frames. A lump of prison bread
was another exhibit, but the
star turn was the display o£
the two medals given to Marian
Pratt and Mrs. Archdale for
endurance to the last extremity
when hunger-striking in prison.
There is no mention of the

dropped dowm her back after attaching her-
self to the grille in the ladies’ gallery at

“Sharp Knife”: Quite recently a passenger
in a steamer plying from M.L. to Sydney—
a four-day 12(X)-mile run—died from ruptured
appendix. M.L. shipping regulations do not
compel the employment of a ship’s sur-
geon, and even when one is carried he cannot
always be depended on for an operation re-
quiring skill and experience. Ships’ doctors
at “£25 per month and found” are generally
flattered by the name of surgeon. Many are
young rolling stones; many are old men seek-
ing a snug job which their age or out-of-date-
ness prevents them from getting ashore. Others
are conscientious, capable physicians, but
unskilled as surgeons, and if any job can be
pernickety, even to a sound surgeon, it is
the commonplace appendix “gone wrong.”
Wireless instructions from shore cannot
remove an appendix. All such ships as these
should carry a doctor, preferably a surgeon.
And the ship should be fitted with a sick
bay with an emergency operating-table (cost
£l5), and dressings and gowns sterilised in
“drums” at the port before she sails. The
struggle of a ship’s doctor attempting to
operate with makeshift instruments ham-
mered out by the engineer chief, which one
sometimes reads about, is really an indict-
ment of the owners for sending a vessel to
sea inadequately equipped.

“Country Ped”: Even the rolls of the
humblest school are worth keeping, if only
for the light they may throw at some future
date on the early history of great men. All
the old records in the .Yackandandah (Vic.)
school are still extant, and in the register of
the old Common School, the forerunner of
the State School which did not arrive until
1872, one may read the scholastic beginnings
of our first home-born Governor-General. In
copperplate it is set forth that Isaac Isaacs
entered the third class at the age of eight
years four months in Jan., 1864, and, pass-
ing through each class in successive years
to the final sixth, left in Jan., 1869.

“Adam Ant”: The Melbourne “Herald”
has revived as a serial that forgotten sensa-
tion, Louis de Rougemont, who startled the
world in the “Wide World Magazine” about
1898 with his staggering adventures in
Northern Australia. Newnes and his news-
paper lieutenants took Louis seriously, and
lie had a great vogue in London until the
“Daily Chronicle” made some disclosures
which blew him out. He turned out to be a
Swiss named Louis Grien, who had been in
West Australia as butler to the Governor,
Sir William Robinson, had done some pearl-
ing and had been shipwrecked. Most of his
adventures were sheer invention. He was a
curious blend of simplicity and cunning, but
he certainly pulled the public’s leg while his
imposition lasted. For a time he appeared
at the London Hippodrome, riding on a
turtle. Rickards brought him to Australia,
but the audience wouldn’t listen to him. He
made only one appearance in Melbourne and
one in Sydney, getting the bird handsomely on
each occasion.

“S.N.R.”: It is hard to credit “C. San-

of any fly would have no effect except a
harmful one on purulent wounds. In gan-

enough to require removal can be dissected
away with scissors or a scalpel. Maggots
being anything but discriminating insects —
as evidenced by their activities in the living
flesh of sheep—l cannot picture any surgeon
in his senses introducing them into a wound
and leaving them to decide when and where
to cease their eroding functions.

“T.P.”: Frank Tate, for 30 years Vic.
Director of Education, was a close student
of Shakspeare, which enabled him to heave
some clever retorts at his critics when the
Melbourne dailies were attacking his far-
reaching educational reforms. It was at a club
function in Melbourne that he genially
referred to “Purblind Argus, all eyes and no
sight” (“Troilus and Cressida”). The lut
was highly appreciated by the “Herald”
chief until he received his issue—“ The
most mighty gods send such dreadful
Heralds” (“Julius Caesar”). The “Age” of the
day was particularly critical, and was met
with references to “Unregarded Age in
corners thrown” (“As You Like It”), and
“Age, thou art shamed” (Julius Caesar”).

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Girls are the real draw at swimming carnivals,
The Women’s Swimming Association of N.S.W. spent
half an hour rejecting applications from a host of
men’s clubs for the appearance of girl champions.”
Though man in mere velocity be master,
And Arne Borgs and Charltons and the
rest
May cleave the deep or plough the billows
faster,
Your naiads will be watched with keener
zest.
Hero, we’ll readily concede, if candor
Complete and absolute is what you want,
Had made a prettier picture than Leander,
Crossing the Hellespont.
The torso, hardened by incessant tussles,
Admiring notice beyond doubt deserves,
But what attraction lurks in iron muscles
Comparable to that in radiant curves?
When, amid cheering crowds, through heaving
waters
Celebrities aquatic skim and spin,
It’s not Creation’s lords but Beauty’s
daughters
That bring the dollars in.
Belike they lived too soon to taste the glory
That waits the girl whose swimming togs
are donned,
Helen and many another famed in story,
Dark Cleopatra and Fair Rosamond.
Those flowing robes of theirs were figure-
swathers.
However chic when in her boat she got,
She would have made a bigger hit in bathers,
The Lady of Shalott,
Your Webbs and Cavills showed what
strength and speed is,
Winning their way to triumphs through
the wet.
Nathless his ticket will be on Mercedes
Who ever had an eyeful of Annette.
And if you’d see your gate returns are
brimmers
Wherever carnival allures are starred,
Bethink, among the plenitude of swimmers,
The flapper champ’s the card.

“Spare Corp”: The other day a man
stopped me in George-street, Sydney, and
reminded me that we had enlisted on the
same day at Victoria Barracks. He further
recalled that the day on which the country
had accepted our services was Friday the
13th. Superstition had such a hold, even
in the war years, that only three en-
listments were put through at the barracks
on that day. Seeing that at least two out
of the three are still here —and the third may
be, for all I know —the bad luck didn’t hit in
our cases.

“J.S.P.”: Our Official History omits all
mention of how the gallant lads of the
R.A.N. stormed Nauru. The landing party
found no one to receive them, and were won-
dering if there was anyone there, when a China-
man appeared. He casually mentioned that he
was a British subject from Hong Kong and
not a German. The next move was to the
Governor’s residence, which seemed at first
glance deserted. As the party mounted the
steps, however, the front door was thrown
open, and a lady of commanding: presence
appeared. Rather nervously the leader of the
stormers explained that they had come to
demand the surrender of the island to the
British, and asked for the Governor. The
lady smiled expansively and put the question
by. Said she, “Wollen sie ein glas lager
hahen, Herr Hauptmann ?” It was a hot day
and Herr Hauptmann rather thought he
would —so did all his tail.

“Mako”: One Maoriland product that
proved its worth at Napier was the native
flax, the Phormium tenax of science. The
terrific strain imposed by the heaving earth
on the Veronica’s iron hawsers caused them
to snap, leaving the ship dependent on the
only ones that stood the pull, those made of
the strong-fibred Maoriland flax.

“Chevroford”: There was a fine subject for
a film drama, on the best American models,
at Lake Tyers, 210 miles from Melbourne,
during the Christmas holidays. The lake,
THE GREEN DRAGON
“Jack put his financial position before me yesterday.”
“I don’t doubt it. Jack would put his money before anything.”
which is 16 miles long and the site of the
only abo. station left in Victoria, has excel-
lent fishing in season and half a dozen board-
ing-houses scattered about its shores. On
the ocean side it is closed by a bar. The
owner of a tourist motor-launch wanted a
high lake so that he could carry people to
and fro; the mailman wanted a low lake
so that his roads might not he submerged;
one boarding-house proprietor wanted a
high lake because it would cut off cus-
tomers from a competitor; local fishermen
wanted a closed bar because their boats
were already inside; and fishermen from
other parts wanted a channel so that they
could get in and share the spoil. A noc-
turnal raid was made by fishermen from
Lakes Entrance armed with spades. They
had almost finished digging a canal to con-
nect the lake with the ocean when the vil-
lage constable, apprised by the launch pro-
prietor, arrived on the scene with a revolver
and made them fill it in again. The next
attack was a massed one, made in broad
daylight. Boats converged from all direc-
tions, bringing fishermen. Boarding-house
proprietors arrived in buggies. The mailman
came in his Ford. Thrusting their authority,
countersigned by the Marine Board, in the
face of the enemy, the army went to work,
and after three days of unremitting labor
the blue waters of the ocean were looking at
the blue waters of the lake along a lane
that did credit to the muscles, if not to the
intelligences, of the De Lessepses assembled.
In short, everything had been thought of
except the relative levels of the lake and the
ocean! The honest workers would have
achieved more if they had bailed the lake
out with a chain of buckets.

“Oxmead” : The reputed Dutchman whose
bones lay undisturbed for 280 years until
the other day near the mouth of the Moore
River (B. 11/2/’3l) was only one of hun-
dreds who perished along this coast in the
first half of the seventeenth century. Twenty
years before there were 125 massacred on
the Abrolhos Islands and a few more
executed. The wreck of the Vergulde
Draeck, of which the Moore River find is
supposed to be a relic, cost nearly 200 lives,
and there are numerous minor casualties to
Dutch shipping recorded and doubtless more
unrecorded. It is a curious reflection that
the part of Australia which was first known
to Europeans should be the last occupied.
Even as far back as the days of William
and Mary, Dutchmen tramped over what
is nowadays Cottesloe, one of Perth’s most
popular suburbs, when Vlaming landed in
1696 and marched his 86 companions east-
ward till they were pulled up by the Swan
River. They didn’t strike anything to induce
them to stop for more than a few days, and
apparently they didn’t take anything away
with them except a few black swans.
* * * *
“Sidi” : I note that one of those Bedouin
sheiks executed by the Turks (B. 11/2/’3l)
made his marble good by willing his entire
fortune —some £30 —for the erection of a
small “mosque.” The edifice is really to be
the deceased gentleman’s tomb, and ensures
a billet for an attendant to collect offerings
for the upkeep of the shrine —and of the
attendant. These tombs are generally on main
roads and caravan routes, and when the
entombed develops into a saint, as lie _ soon
does if the tombkeeper knows his business,
the takings are worth while. There is a
famous Arab story of a youth whose sole
possession, a donkey, “died on him.” He had
just finished burying the beast, with many
lamentations, when a caravan arrived and
made inquiries. By a happy inspiration the
youth explained that the interred was his
uncle, a holy saint. A tomb was reared in
short order and the disconsolate nephew
put in charge; then the caravan, after a
liberal subscription, passed on. For years
the nephew lived on the fat of the land,
until he at last went the way of his “uncle”
and became a saint himself.

“Chev”: A well-known Melbourne mercer
has installed an ingenious advertising
device. As the possible customer enters
the shop a voice whispers in her ear that
perhaps the old man wants a new suit of
dungarees, or maybe little Willie needs
some stockings; if so, look at the article in
this window and the price on it. The lady
looks round sharply and sees no one, but
the voice continues to accompany her with
the same uncanny capacity for anticipating
her wants. The stunt is worked by an
observer who stands on the floor above
studying newcomers as they are reflected in a
mirror. A concealed amplifier does the rest.
“X.S.": Since 1921 the population of Mel-
bourne has increased by 231.621 and now
stands at 14,600 over the million. But the
city proper, now estimated at 103,500, is
only 249 higher than it was in 1921. The cheap
terms provided by the Savings Bank, the
War Service Homes and a multitude of
private builders have resulted in the cen-
tral portions of the metropolis being
evacuated for dinky suburban dwellings, often
situated 16 miles from where the worker
earns his bread and butter. Long terraces
of city tenement houses lie clamoring for
tenants in consequence, and landlords
give them fresh coats of paint in vain. The
Australian citizen has no notion of making
his city his home, like the Parisian, and
indeed the civic fathers give him no encour-
agement to do so. Lately the philosophers
who used to decorate the steps of the Bourke-
street post office have been ordered to remove
elsewhere. There is not a seat or a shady
nook in any direction for half a mile or so.
It is worth noting that no fewer than 4711
persons live on shipping in Melbourne.
“Adelaide”: A Lameroo (S.A.) farmer has
gambled interestingly in the matrimonial
market by importing for his helpmate a
pretty typist from Riga, on the strength
of a published photo. It took three
jears to square matters with the Common-
wealth, but somehow neither of the pair
troubled to learn the other’s language. When
the lady arrived they were married at once—-in
English and German—and departed for the
Backblocks without being able to converse.
CLEARING FOR ACTION.
“Good gracious, Lois, I didn’t know you were moving.”
“We are not. I’m only getting ready to give the housemaid notice.”
“Hadji Baba”: That much-boomed exhibi-
tion of “priceless” Persian art in London has
sustained something of a set-back through the
discovery of the name of a Berlin manufac-
turing firm on a couple of carpets that were
supposed to be the product of Samarcand.
There has been some attempt to explain it
away, but the world is always too ready for
a laugh at the expense of connoisseurs and
experts to take much notice of the explana-
tion. The incident recalls the wax bust of
many years ago which German experts,
headed by that All-Expertest, the then
Kaiser, declared to be a genuine Greek pro-
duction, probably from the hand of Praxi-
teles. Later investigation showed that part
of the “core” on which the bust was built up
consisted of copies of a Birmingham news-
paper printed in the 1870’s. The silence that
followed could have been cut with a knife.

“H.A.L.” : Touching the illegality of enter-
ing private houses in search of divorce-court
evidence (B. 28/l/’31). Not long since a
sleuth entered one of the bedrooms
of a S. Aus. seaside pub by way
of the window. Possibly he found
what he was looking for ; anyway,
there were feminine screams and
masculine threats. At this point
Bung arrived, also by way of
the window, and without a word
fell on the intruder and gave him
a terrific hiding. Then he confided
to the occupants of the room:
“People across the road saw him
getting in and rang up to tell
me, I don’t care what he was
after ; I’m going to ring the police
station and ask them to take a
burglar in charge.” The sergeant
obliged; the prisoner managed to
get bail next day, and started to
tell all and sundry of the thump-
ing damages he was going to
recover from Bung for assault. But
it was noticed that after an inter-
view with a lawyer he became very subdued
and thoughtful.

“C.Q.” : A queer organisation in Melbourne
is the Cormorant Club. It is not a culinary
branch of the Froth-blowers’ Fraternity, but
a society devoted to the common good and
sport of a sort. It goes up periodically to
the river Murray, with the entire approval
of the Games and Fisheries Department, and
reduces the shag population in the interests
of the anglers. Members find solace, into
which a slight degree of sadism possibly
enters, in blowing the shag rookeries into
smithereens with explosive bullets. All the
victims are not always killed outright, but
this is regarded as inevitable. A scientist
who accompanied a. recent expedition, though
accustomed to the vivisection table, lost his
breakfast in viewing the spectacle.

“R. Volt”: In the days when there was
no seismograph in Wellington (M.L.), the
Government Meteorologist had a rough-and-
ready method of ascertaining the extent and
general direction of a ’quake. He used to rush
round to the cable co.’s office and inspect the
record provided by the receiving instruments
on the two cables from Sydney. These were
very much on the system of a seismograph.
A moving tape sped underneath a glass siphon,
which spurted a thin stream of ink on to
the paper. The siphon was connected to a
delicately suspended coil and faithfully repro-
duced its motions. It was not an exact
record, because the coil was damped and
the instrument was mounted on an anti-
vibration stand, but the effect of this was
nullified through the office being on the top
floor of a six-storey building. When the
structure began to sway the staff would make
a unanimous rush for the door, interest in
scientific research being at the moment at a
discount; but the meteorologist invariably
paid us a visit after the excitement had suo-
sided, when the tell-tale pieces of tape would
be salvaged from the basket. I believe he
found them of considerable use except when
they got mixed with any telegram Sydney
happened to be sending.

“Bang-Pa-In”: Canberra’s fame seems to
have travelled far beyond the Commonwealth.
Extract from the “Bangkok Times
(7/l/’3l) :
So far as Western India is concerned, the opening
of the new Capital in February evokes almost no
enthusiasm. Yet it would be a pity if New Delhi
became a city as dead as Pompeii, Persepolis or
Canberra.
As dead as Persepolis or Canberra! It may
become a variant for “one with Nineveh and
Tyre.”
“Centurion”: It would be interesting to
catalogue the rare and little-heard-of war
decorations picked up by members of the
A.I.F. in the big disturbance, Montenegrin,
Portuguese, Chinese, and others too obscure
to remember. One of the medals presented
by the Municipality of Verdun to soldiers or
the Allied armies who fought on that sector
came recently to Australia, the recipient
being A. Osgood, of Sydney, who served
against the German break-through of 191 b
in the 6th F.A.8., A.I.F. One of the
rarest of medals was that struck many years
ago by the Colonial Office for the members
of the British New Guinea Armed Con-
stabulary, who had a lot of stiff hgnting
to do in the days of William Macgregor.
Only four were issued, one to the Com-
mandant, a Queenslander named Butter-
worth. He served in the South African
War with a Queensland contingent, aTK ] Fjt
up the ribbon. If he is still alive he is
unlikely to have forgotten the wigging he
got from an indignant Imperial brass-hat
for his temerity.

“L. Pencil” : A luscious treat that has been
snatched away from Sydney’s watering mouth
by old General D. Presh is the Great Aus-
tralian World’s Exhibition. Under happier
financial auspices this would now have
been in full blast, perched on the Maroubra
motor track, embellished for the occasion with
lakes, kiosks, switchback railways and a
shoot-the-chute. In ornate pavilions there
would have been displayed in lavish detail
all the resources, material, artistic and ethno-
logical, of this vast continent. Countless
throngs would be surging from all parts ot
the world to gaze on the Bridge, and the ice-
cream and soft-drinks industries, not to nren-
tion the brewers and the vignerons, would be
rolling in unprecedented profits. At least that
is the picture conjured up by a prospectus
issued some months ago. The property on
which the show was to be held comprises
several acres of wilderness and a fine con-
crete speed track. But it is a long way ou
of town, and attempts to make it Sydney s
main centre of car and motor-cycle racing
failed dismally. The ground has change,
hands many times, each sale being at
smaller figure than the one before.
TO AN ORANGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In days gone by we thought you rather
vulgar,
Playing a humble though not hidden part,
The darling of the undiscerning many,
Sold from a stall (at two or three a penny)
Or from a coster’s cart.
And yet at times, caught by your golden
beauty,
One wondered —-“Was’t perchance such
fruits as these
That tempted Atalanta’s feet to dally,
Or burned among the boughs in some bright
alley
Of the Il'esperides ?”
Yet all things change, and you are scorned
no longer,
But honored, sought, acclaimed on pictured
page.
No more your lovers are apologetic;
To be concerned with matters dietetic
Has now become the rage.
And so you yield to neither pears nor
peaches,
To neither purple grapes nor luscious
pines,
But cheerfully adorn the proudest table,
Since yours it is to bear the glorious label —
“Richest in Vitamines !”

PERSONAL
ITEMS
Eric Bowden, sometime Minister for
Defence, who died at Parramatta last week
in his 59th year, was an Australian of the
fourth generation, his great-grandfather hav-
ing arrived in 1812 to take charge of the
infant colony’s schools. Bowden was
admitted a solicitor in 1894 and entered the
Federal Parliament as M.H.R. for Nepean
in 1906. He lost the seat and regained it;
then, Nepean having been wiped out, 1922
found him in Joe Cook’s old stronghold of
Parramatta, and a year later he was one of
Bruce’s men. He held the portfolio for a
couple of years and retained his seat until
the political landslide at the last general
election.
Dr. Maloney, M.H.R., and Vie. Speaker
Alec Peacock will complete 42 years’ con-
tinuous Parliamentary service on March 28.
Maloney was in the Vic. Assembly nearly 15
years before leaving it for the Reps.; Pea-
cock has stayed in it, though he had an un-
successful shot for the Senate in 1903, when
Robert Reid beat him for the vacancy created
by Sargood’s death.
Among ■ the hundreds of goldseekers at
Larkinville (W.A.) is Hugo Throssell, V.C.,
husband of novelist Katharine Prichard. He
bought Larkin’s original claim from that old
prospector and is working it himself.
Archdeacon Brocklehurst., who was dan-
gerously injured when Napier cathedral col-
lapsed, was well known in Australia. He was
ordained there in 1902, in Queensland, and
was missionary chaplain to Rockhampton
diocese until he became vicar of St.
Barnabas’, North Rockhampton. In 1907 he
went to Waitara (M.L.) as vicar, and after
holding several other posts was diocesan sec-
retary of Waitara and private chaplain to
the bishop of that province until 1929.
Few men have done more to prove and
advertise the excellence of Australian wool
than Arthur Irbv Traill, who passed out last
week at Quirindi (N.S.W.) at 76. His
father, Dr. R. J. Traill, founded a notable
flock at Collaroy in 1855, and the son
became one of the most successful of fine-
wool growers. His fleeces won prizes and
trophies at home and abroad, and for years
tlie clip from his Llangollen station topped
the Australian market. He married a
daughter of William Windeyer and seven
children survive him; one son was killed in
France.
Commonwealth Meteorologist Hunt must
leave the service, since nobody who has
passed 65 can be trusted to know anything
about science; and D. J. Mares, who has
been watching the weather in N. S. Wales
for many years, will probably take his place
—until 1934. Then, unless we have learned
more sense by that time, he, too, will pass
on. Mares was almost born in the Observa-
tory ; anyway, he grew up alongside one
on Dawes Point, and can’t remember when
Weather-prophet MARES.
he didn’t know isotherms and gauges. So it
was a natural thing that when he sat for
his public-service entrance exam, he should
score almost the possible in meteorology.
H. C. Russell was the boss in those days;
he was the Government Astronomer and
Meteorologist whose daughter, having been
told how convenient it must be to have a pa
who could advise them what clothes to put
on in this changeable climate, replied that
they didn’t go by pa’s forecasts —they went
by ma’s corns.
John Moore Chanter, of Malvern Grove,
Caulfield, Vic., Minister for Mines in the
N.S.W. Government of 1889, and M.H.R. for
Riverina in the first House of Representa-
tives, had his 86th birthday last week. An
Adelaide native, he was founder and first
secretary of the Farmers’ Union of Vic., and
first president of the A.N.A. in the Ma
State. There are eight octogenarians
among the surviving members of the first
Commonwealth Parliament. The doyen of
the lot is Tom Glassey (86), of Brisbane.
Two other Queenslanders are J. G. Drake
(80) and F. W. Bamford (82). There are
three South Australians : Josiah Symon, K.C.

Langdon Bonytlion (82). A foundation
Senator of N.S.W. is Albert Gould (84).

T. J. Ley, now abroad, has been described
as a member of the syndicate which is to
run sweeps on English races at Dantzig—
the overlords of the tiny republic of Andorra
blocked the enterprise “on the ground of
morality”—but states that he is merely its
solicitor. Ley was regarded as rather a
strict or even strait-laced person when he
was Fuller’s Minister for Justice in N.S.W.
He left State politics and won the Barton
seat from Labor against heavy odds six years
ago, but failed to hold it for more than one
term.
There were few men better known on the
Westralian goldfields in the early years of
the century than Dr. Charles Swanston, of
Kalgoorlie, just dead in Auckland ait 75. An
exceedingly able surgeon, whose services were
always in brisk demand, he was almost as
well advertised by his unconventionality and
the none-too-friendly attitude evinced towards
him by some of his fellow-practitioners.
“Swanny,” however, always held his own and
earned his fees with the best of them. He
returned to his native Maoriland about 1907.
Three of the five reappointed members of
Melbourne Harbor Trust, G. F. Holden
(chairman), J. A. Boyd and D. McLennan,
are ex-members of Vic. Assembly who sat

thereby (unintentionally) made room in the
Assembly for Hogan.
The Victorian civil servant appears to
have a penchant for the priesthood. The
latest recruit is M. J. Killeen, who has

A great figure in Australian farming was
removed when H. W. Potts died suddenly in
Innisfail (N.Q.), whither he had gone to
inspect the Maltese colony there. A North-
umbrian, Potts came to Queensland 58 years
ago, a qualified agricultural chemist. His
first Government job was in Victoria, where
he started the first butter factory and laid
the foundations of scientific dairying in that
State. Later he became principal of the
Hawkesbury Agricultural College, and during
his 20-years’ reign he built up a world-wide
reputation for that N.S.W. institution.
Retiring in 1920, he was appointed
head of the Australian Farms’ Training Col-
lege in Norfolk, founded by the late Tilden
Smith. The college was destroyed by fire,
and the death of the founder caused the
project to be abandoned. Later, Potts was
engaged by ex-Governor Strickland to report
on agricultural conditions in Malta, subse-
quently becoming Commissioner for Malta in
Australia; but he did not quite hit it with
the Maltese here.
Air-Commodore Samson, who set out on
the Long Flight in London last week at the
early age of 48, was one of the most pic-
turesque of the war aviators. He entered the
Navy in 1898, and saw service in Somaliland
and the Persian Gulf before becoming a
pioneer of the seaplane. He was one of the
first to develop night flying, the very first
to attempt the launching of a ’plane from
a ship at sea. During the war he served on
every front, among his victims being a Zep.
How he took some of the risks he did and
came out scathless was one of the wonders
of those wonderful times. Australian and
other details at Mudros will remember Sam-
son with mixed feelings. He was fond of
making sudden bombing excursions against
the Turks, which visits were always repaid
with interest by a much superior fleet of
’planes. A big man in many ways, liis ten-
dency to ignore military and naval conven-
tions did not make him persona grata to the
brass-hats.
Just passed his 80th milestone, Dr. W.
T. Kendall, Vic.’s most distinguished veter-
inarian. Three sons all followed their dad’s
profession ; all three, too, served in the Boer
War and the Great War, and each
finished up a colonel. A sister went to the
front as a nurse. One of the sons is chief
veterinary officer and head of tlie stock
branch of Vic. Agricultural Department.
. Dean Tucker, of Ballarat, has completed
50 years in the Anglican ministry and is
about to retire. Born in England 75 years
ago and educated at Cambridge, _ he came to
Australia soon after his ordination in 1881,
and commenced his career at Holy Trinity,
Bowen (N.Q.). He was at Charters Towers
a few years later, and has been Dean of
Ballarat since 1912. Ballarat, which loves
the fine old man, is disregarding his protest
that it is no time for presentations, and the
first subscriber was the head of the R.C.
community, Father McGloin.
Wallace Nelson, journalist, has addressed
thousands of meetings during the past half-
century and expatiated on hundreds of sub-
jects. Yet even for him it must have been
a novel experience to supply a large and
appreciated portion of the verbal fireworks
at the meeting of Associated Newspapers
shareholders in Sydney last week. One paper
credited the mercurial Wallace with having
been at some remote period M.L.A. for Yil-
garn (W.A.). He never was; Hannans was
his electorate in 1904-05. Before that he had
been a candidate for Capricornia (Q.) at
the first Federal elections and put up an
uncommonly good fight. From desperately
serious Labor organs to chatty social jour-
nals, Wallace has run most varieties of
newspaper in his time, and anything he
hasn’t written about he has lectured on.
Clifford Book, K.C., Victoria’s Crown

C. H. BOOK, K.C.

more than a

Attorney-Gen-
eral couldn’t
do it, and they had to wait till a Court
could sit. Book was a Digger before he
was a Crown Prosecutor; in fact, he wasn’t
called to the Bar before he had settled the
Kaiser, though he had passed his LL.B. in
1915.
Among the 17 candidates for the National-
ist nomination in East Sydney were two ex-
politicians, both one-time Laborites, T. H.
Morrow and J. J. Morrish. Morrish was
member for King when conscription split
the party and lost him his seat. Before
getting into Parliament he was secretary of
the Hotel and Restaurant Employees’ Union.
Professor Mungo MacCallum is going to
have a birthday party next week, and con-
gratulations will pour in on the G.O.M. of
Sydney University. Coming to it 44 years
ago as Professor of Modern Literature, he
has served it since then as Dean of his
The Sydney Uni.’s G.O.M.
Faculty, as Warden, as Vice-Chancellor and
as Deputy Chancellor, and always with
enthusiasm. His services to literature in
Sydney have not been confined to the Uni-
versity either: he has been a hearty sup-
porter of all the city’s cultural movements.
He will be 77 on the 26th.
Of Australian ex-Premiers, Carruthers
(N.S.W.) led a Government as long ago as
August, 1904, and Propsting (Tas.) formed
a Ministry in April, 1903. Westralia has a
couple of citizens whose hours of greatness
came even further back; Walter James was
at the head of affairs in July, 1902, and
A. E. Morgans in Nov., 1901. But Alex.
Feacock holds the belt; he was Vic. Premier
in Feb., 1901.
Plump, bespectacled Arthur Hyland has
just completed his fifth year as director of
Australian trade publicity in Great Britain.
He was publicity officer and slogan-writer
in the Vic. railways when lie landed the
£l5OO-a-year job, and had been responsible
for initiating the Victorian “Eat More
Fruit” campaign and assisting in the organi-
sation of the first Reso. and “Better Farm-
ing” trains. He is, among other things, an
expert wireless telegraphist, an effective
after-dinner speaker and an inveterate chess-
player.
“Uramao”: Reference to the celebrations
in Normandy in honor of William the Con-
queror’s birth and the anticipated presence
of Englishmen whose ancestors wielded
battle-axes at Hastings (B. 21/1/’3l)
recalls the death in Dunedin (M.L.) a few
years ago of a descendant of Sir Michael Le
Fleming, wlio crossed to England with
the Conqueror. Sir Andrew Le Fleming
was born in Christchurch, his father having
been an early arrival in the Dominion. He
wasn’t a bit puffed up by his ancient lineage,
for when I knew him in North Otago in the
’nineties he was a horse-breaker and trainer.
On his death the baronetcy went to a cousin,
Sir William Le Fleming, of Taranaki.
Alick McCallum, deputy leader of the
Westralian Parliamentary Labor party and
one of those who attended the A.L.P. meet-
ing at Melbourne by special invitation of
the executive, has participated in more poli-
tical and industrial pow-wows than any other
man in Mitchell’s State. He is an Adelaide
native, brought up to the bookbinding trade,
who went to Perth and pertinaciously shinned
up the Trades H'all ladder till he became
general secretary of the Labor party. From
there to Parliament is generally but a step,
but Alick —-“Smart Alick” he was sometimes
called in those days—sustained one or two
defeats before he dropped into a safe seat at
Fremantle. When Labor returned to power
in 1923 he secured a portfolio, and ever since
has been known as Collier’s right-hand man.
“Avon”: Maoriland’s oldest newspaper
man is Bob Loughman, who recently cele-
brated the passing of his 90th milepost. He
shipped for Australia from his native Lanca-
shire at the age of 27, was wrecked in the
steamer George Marshall on the Tasmanian
coast, and landed eventually in Sydney in
the days when the district south of the Hay-
market was a wild waste of paddocks. He
was editor of the “Lyttelton Times” (now
“Christchurch Times”) in the prehistoric
days before Sam Saunders took charge,
was afterwards editor of the now-defunct
“New Zealand Times” of Wellington, and
after that, following on a spell as a. civil
servant, was chief leader-writer and virtual
editor of the same journal in the days when
Geddies owned it. Recently he wrote a life
of Joseph Ward.

Owing to steadily mounting costs —mainly
coal and labor —this co. advanced the price
charged for gas from 4s. per 1000 c.f. in
1018 to os. 3d. in 1927; the charge has
remained steady since. Nevertheless, divs.
called for £13,444 more than the declared
net profits over the last five years. But
that was mainly because of the trouble on
the Maitland coalfields, which involved the
co. in extra costs aggregating £54,454 since
the close of accounts in 1928. This was
charged direct to the special purposes and
depreciation fund, which is the only backstop
the co. has for contingencies heyond the
management’s control. So £33,564, or about
three times the average of recent years, was
charged against last year’s earnings to help
recoup the loss; thus raising the fund to
£52,771 at Dec. 31 —approximately half the
maximum amount allowed under the Act.
Hence the slip of £17,484 in the year’s
declared net earnings and the recession in the
div. Under ordinary circumstances the
standard S p.c. div. would have been more
than earned.
Here is the position as the revenue
account discloses it: —

Special purposes 10,800 -/2f 33,564 -/8$
Other charges 42,662 -/10f 45,108 1/-
The smaller gas sales are a sign of the times.
More of the by-products were used in the
business, thus causing a shrinkage in returns
from residuals. The most encouraging fea-
ture is a drop of 4d. per 1000 c.f. in manu-
facturing costs, due partly to the lower
price of coal, and partly to savings from the
installation of a new waterless gasholder
at Oyster Cove. The increase in other
charges was due to the growth in debenture
•interest, which was £5155 heavier at £19,358.
Whether the profits claimed have been
earned depends upon whether the sums spent
on works, etc., and charged to revenue, which
is equivalent to writing down fixed assets,
prove to be enough to cover actual deprecia-
tion. The next table shows what has been
done in this way of recent years:—

If the expenditure has been inadequate,
profits have been overstated, which will mean
trouble in the future. However, the engineer
regularly reports the plant in good order and
condition.
During the year the share capital remained
steady at £740,675. The debenture debt was
increased by £BO,OOO, lifting it to £270,000;
other liabilities totalled £109,289. Liquids
amounted to £55,708. The outlay on plant
was £51,196, raising its book value to
£964,717; freeholds figured at £228,669.
Mr. Justice Davidson was recently
appointed a commissioner to inquire whether
the price charged by 'this and other Sydney
gas cos. is more than it need be in order ,to
maintain the standard (8 p.c.) div. The
result of the inquiry has not yet been
announced.
On the market the scrip is priced at a
shade under par; which suggests fear of
rhe possibility of further legislative inter-
ference with the div.

This co. has been in the squatting business
for close on half a century, but it was not
until wool prices took their post-war leap
that shareholders got anything worth men-
tioning out of the business. For the 23 years
to the close of accounts in 1923 divs. averaged
4£ p.c. ; and that was largely a return of
capital, half of which was written off (re-
ducing it to £146,002) to cover amortisation
of the co.’s Thuruloonga leases in s.-w.
Queensland.
In case it shouldn’t be able to renew
these leases, which fall-in in 1934, the co.
bought Quantambone, with 76,736 sheep off-
shears, near Brewarrina (N.S.W.) for
£275,000 about 2| years ago. Immediately
drought gripped both the properties, which
were practically bare of feed at the time.
Most of the breeding ewes, rams and young
wethers were saved, but, of course, the lamb-
ing was a failure,’ and heavy mortality and
realisations resulted in exceptional losses on
livestock account. Also there was a sharp
drop in the price of the staple; thus a loss
of £101,680 showed up in 1929.
Early in the last term the drought broke,
though not before 19,334 sheep had died —
the deaths numbered 34,913 in the previous
year. The lambing, however, was success-
ful, but the clip was lighter and prices con-
tinued to ease; all of which shows up in
this next comparison:—

1930.. 100,011 139,644 2298 25,300 11/0/2
Direct expenditure on account of the drought
(£7080) and the loss on livestock (£1152)
were lighter by £27,976 and £42,525 respec-
tively. But the wool sold fetched £13,327
less; the net result of the year’s operations
being a loss of £35,570, which piled the
deficit to £112,692.
Disregarding direct drought expenditure
and the livestock losses, the year’s trading
would have resulted in a loss of £27,338.
There appears to be little prospect of a
substantial rise in wool prices, so until the
co. can get some relief from the burden of
overhead, including wages, rents, freights,
interest on the overdraft and selling charges,
etc., its ability to earn much, if anything,
in the way of profits is doubtful.
Dividend prospects have been pushed into
the background by the accumulated deficit
and the growth of the overdraft, to which
£17,538 was added last year, making it
£124,257. Here is the position as the
published accounts show it:—
1924. 1928. 1929. 1930.
Capital .. £146,002 £243,338 £243,338 £243,338

Wool unsold.. 810 1,008 1,056 1,900
Cash, etc. .. 109,789 3,379 4,138 2,085
Thus the excess of liabilities over more or
less liquids, including livestock, increased
£21,672 last year, mounting to £60,554 at
Dec. 31. There were then 42,824 more sheep
(mainly lambs) on the books than there were
a year earlier, but only £3740 was added
to the book value of livestock.
Seasonal prospects are the brightest thing
in the eo.’& outlook. The stock is reported in
good condition, and there is enough feed on
the properties to last for several months yet.
Before the publication of accounts, sellers
asked 19s. for the fully paid 30s. shares,
which fetched 3Ss. two years ago.

Both turnover and prices were down; but
the board says an overhaul of the organisa-
tion resulted in better service at reduced
cost; and further savings are anticipated.
Thus the div. was lifted 2£ points, raising it
to 51 p.c. for the year. That called for a
trifle more than the admitted net earnings,
which suggests that everything may not
be on view. Still, there is no reason to
suspect that anything worth mentioning is
hidden. Shareholders have had only moderate
returns from the business.
Since the £73,354 was struck off capital
in 1904 to cover drought losses —it was
restored by the capitalisations of 1911 and
1913- —divs. have averaged aproximately 8J
p.c. The richest period was the 10 years to
the close of accounts in 1920, during which
the average distribution rose to 10J p.c. For
the decade just closed it was 6.2 p.c., and
that took all but £7OOO-odd of the disclosed
net earnings. Not that the co. has been
unable to win its fair share of business.
Extensions to plant, etc., to cope with
expanding turnover have added £215,473 to
the book value of fixed assets since 1920.
But owing to price-cutting, due to excessive
competition, and steadily mounting costs the
co. has not got much benefit from the
bigger trading.
To lighten the floating debt and provide for
further expansion mf the business £lOO,OOO
7 p.c. first-mortgage debentures, redeemable
in 1934, were issued about three years ago.
Here is the position as the published accounts
disclose it: —

Book debts . . 58,718 75,551 76,982 65,398
The year’s reduction in book debts and stock,
which suggests smaller turnover, enabled
£13,294 to be wiped off the overdraft (now
£10,033) and £7939 off the amount coming
to sundry creditors. When the books closed
more or less liquids, including stocks, ex-
ceeded the floating debt by £70,390, which
was £l5ll less than at the previous balance.
No hint is given as to what allowance has
been made for depreciation, but plant is re-
ported thoroughly efficient.
The market, which notes the moderate and
irregular earnings, and that there are deben-
tures in front of the share capital, prices
the scrip at Bs. The return at that figure
would be 7.5 p.c. on a 3 p.c. div. basis. The
backing amounts to 245. lOd. in net tangibles,
mainly plant, worth what it can earn.

This co. took over Tasmanian Cement Pty.'s
business, Ilailston (Tas.), at the end of 1928.
It paid £165,845 (in scrip) for net assets,
including a 20,000-ton cement plant, about
104 acres of freehold and a lease of large
shale deposits at Latrobe. Dorman, Long
and Co. were appointed managers. To
finance the erection of a new 65,000-ton plant,
and provide for extension of the old one,
a further 117,500 prefs. and a like number
of ords. were issued, all of which were under-
written. Thus paid capital became £367,918
in 142,500 8 p.c. cum. prefs. and 258.345
ords. at Sept. 30 last; there was £32,927 of
calls unpaid.
Cement Distributors Pty., Ltd., was
formed to look after the selling side of the
business. Amongst the contracts secured in'
Melbourne were the cement requirements of
the Harbor Trust (for a year), about one-
quarter of those of the City Council (for
two years) and one-third of the Metropolitan
Board of Works orders (period unstated).
The new plant began production in May,
1930; it is reported to have run smoothly
since, and the quality of the product is up
to expectations.
For the year to Sept. 30 last gross profits
(£32,554) sprang £20,000; and the net result
benefited by £10,772 of the increase. Allow’-
ing for the pref. div. the balance was 4.5 p.c.
on ord. capital at Sept. 30. No div. was
paid: thus reserves climbed to within £7805
of the £21,000 at which underwriting exes,
appear. The prospectus figured a net return
of £90,000 on sales of 110,000 tons cement
annually. But since local demand has
dropped to about half the total capacity of
existing Australian plants, and may yet fall
further, that turnover is not likely to be
obtained until better times come along.
Meanwhile competition is certain to keep
prices low, if it does not develop into a price
war. Tliat, the slackness in the construction
trades and other economic troubles have filled
the outlook with uncertainty.
During the year £82,810 net was spent on
the main asset, as this next comparison of
balance-sheet figures shows: —

To finance the outlay £55,198 of share capital

overdraft (£55,090 at Sept. 30), which is
secured by a debenture. Bills payable
(£14,266) were £3662 lighter. The excess of
liabilities over more or less liquids, including
stocks, increased £12,993, reaching £48,260
when, the books closed.

concern which bought the Crozier patents.
It has a 50 p.c. interest in any benefits from
working the leases. Last year preliminary
retorting yielded 22,000 gallons of crude oil,
and a refining plant has been installed since
the close of accounts. The petrol is claimed
to be more efficient than the imported article,
and power-kerosene, Diesel oil and bitumen
are also being refined and marketed locally.
It is in this side of the business that the
possibilities of the scrip lie. Much will
depend upon costs.
The prefs., which carry a'fixed cumulative
8 p.c., have priority as to capital, but do
not share in surplus assets. Last year’s net
earnings were nearly 1\ times their full
annual requirements; the backing amounts to
£2 15s, 2d. in net tangibles, mainly plant,
etc., worth what it can earn. The net
tangible cover for the ords. is 18s. 6d. The
scrip is not listed.

For 14 years, including the slump of 1921,
a steady 10 p.c. was paid. Last year, after
taking stock at the second-highest figure in
the co.’s history, profits touched the lowest
level since 1917. It is an indication of the
times; the slip in earnings was £2508, the
net result (£6032) being equal to- 7.6 p.c.
on capital compared with 10.7, 12.2 and 11.0
p.c. back to 1927. Only_ twice since the
public became interested in 1911 have re-
serves been drawn on for divs.; so, rather
than break into savings, the div. was reduced
to 7i p.c. for. the past term, and reserves
were added to by £B5, bringing them up to
£19,766.
The co. has built up a substantial export
trade with Asia in the belting and leather
products it manufactures. Despite, the dis-
turbed conditions in China and India, it has
been able to maintain overseas connections.
The recent leap in the exchange rate will
help the co.; most of the jump took place
after the accounts closed. The volume of
local sales has kept the staff fully employed
during most of the term.

Books debts (£21,762) were £2388 lower,
and stocks, apparently owing to accumula-
tions, were valued at £5106 more than in
the previous year. World prices of the -raw
materials at the moment are at a very low
level. Freeholds remain unchanged at
£50,881; plant (£7360) has been written
down £2259 over the last three years.. It
is a moderate item, and has been maintained
in good order. The more or less liquid sur-
plus (£44,670) was £235 lighter.
Last week sellers were asking 19s. for the
scrip, but no business was done at that
figure. At 18s. the return is 7.8 p.c. on a

to 255. in net tangibles, over 11s. of it in
surplus liquids.

This little fire and accident underwriting
concern was launched in Melbourne half a
dozen years ago by 11. L. Carroll: he used
to manage the Federal Mutual's office there.
It was a clean float, and in its first couple
of years the co. promised to secure a footing
at very moderate cost. The business was
extended to Sydney and Adelaide, and 99,360
pound shares were put out and called to ss.
thus paid capital is £24,840—a1l for a
capital expenditure of £1665.
But, like most of the youngsters in the
business, it has found the field rather crowded,

and has been unable to develop an adequate
and profitable underwriting turnover. The
business has slipped consistently over the
last four years, claims and exes, having
made off with £10,350 more than was gath-
ered in net premiums, thus wiping out all
out £1259 of the aggregate interest earnings
and previous underwriting profits.
Moreover, excluding uncalled capital,
which is a doubtful asset these days, the net
tangible cover for policy-holders at Oct. 31
was only a trifle more than two-thirds of
the amount usually looked for. The protec-
tion was in this form:—
IQ9R *IQ9Q IQQO

Liabilities . . . . 8,659 10,228 5,155
Net tangibles .. .. £29,546 £27,376 £26,099
The drop in net tangibles reflects the unpro-
fitable nature of the business. Chief move-
ment in last year’s figures was a reduction
of £6493 in the overdraft (£1556 at Oct. 31),
liquids being drawn upon for the purpose.
Now that the general slump in business
and recession in values have reduced the
volume of insurance business available, com-
petition has further sharpened, and the co. s
prospects are anything but bright. So the
board is considering a proposal for the saie
of the business to the Federal Mutual Insur-
ance Co. on the basis of one Federal for
every two Commercial shares. Both lots of
scrip have a face value of £1 and are paid
to ss. When the books last closed every
two Commercial shares were covered by net
tangibles with a book value of 10s. 6d.; the
net tangible backing for each Federal share
was 9s. lid. If 40 p.c. of the net premiums
be allowed for unexpired risks in each case,
the Federal’s offer amounts to 6s. 9d. for
6s. 3d. in net tangibles.
The Federal, a Sydney concern operating
in four States and now in its nineteenth
year, has a paid capital of £101,988. It
has been a consistent profit-earner from the
jump, and a regular dividend-payer since
1915. After a run of four 10 p.c. distribu-
tions, the rate was dropped to 8 p.c. last
year. Average net earnings over the last
five years were 16.5 p.c. on average capital.
On the basis of the present offer an 8 p.c.
div. would be worth 4 p.c. to shareholders
in the Commercial, who would also gain
greater stability of capital investment.
Associated Newspapers, Ltd.
The “Daily Guardian” and “Telegraph
Pictorial,” two journals that were controlled
by this Sydney newspaper combine which
merged the interests of Sun Newspapers,
Ltd., with those of S. Bennett, Ltd., by an
over-generous exchange of scrip about 16
months ago, made such heavy weather that
their publication was discontinued, and a
new broadsheet, the “Daily Telegraph,” was
launched in their place on Monday last. It
is an enlargement of the “Guardian,” and
a transformed shadow of its former and
once very prosperous namesake. The “Sun-
day Pictorial” has been merged with the
“Sunday Guardian,” publication of which
continues.
Though they sanctioned the changes, share-
holders at an extraordinary general meeting
last week refused to give the board power
to deal with the “Evening News”—-now said
to be losing at the rate of about £BOO per
week —as it thought fit. An offer for the
purchase of the “News,” said to have been
made by the Joynton Smith interests, was
mentioned. But the meeting was strongly
opposed to this paper passing into the hands
of a rival, and a committee of three was
to consult with the board 'on the matter
and report to another meeting at an early date.
The directors, of course, were roundly
criticised for paying no less than £575,000
—£400,000 in fully-paid prefs. and the
balance cash —for the goodwill of the
daily and Sunday “Guardian,” and thus
placing a large wad of pref. capital in front
of the ords. At the time of their purchase
the two “Guardians” were said to be earn-
ing aboht £20,000 a year net; hence the con-
sideration was equal to 29 years’ profits, won
under conditions which very quickly dis-
appeared, and may never return.
A cut in capital has been mentioned, but
action in this respect has been deferred until
the position clears sufficiently for the board
to measure up how far the business has
sunk.
For the year to Sept. 28 last Associated
received £115,665 in divs.; exes, took £13,212,
leaving £102,452 net, or £7140 more than
was needed for the pref. requirements—they
will call for £103,880 for the current term.
At the close of accounts the co. had gone
to its bankers and others for £148,927, and
there was still £140,000 coming to Smith’s
Newspapers, Ltd. Stocks and hook debts
totalled £143,030. Paid capital is £3,577,000
in 1,483,999 7 p.c. cum. prefs., which have
priority as to capital and dividend, and
2,093,001 ords. On the basis of the sub-
sidiaries’ last published figures the whole
of the ord. and about 3s. per share of the
pref. capital was represented by that “will
o’ the wisp” goodwill.
The market speculates in the ords around
35., and the prefs. fetch 10s. 6d.
An Issue at a 9900 p.c. Premium!
Often in Adelaide and occasionally in Mel-
bourne nowadays you are offered quarters of
an original share in “Universal Power” for
anything up to £400; and as the original
shares were £lO, it looks as if somebody was
making money. But it is nothing alongside
what a few r expect to make. Universal
Power is a co. with a capital of £3OOO, 285
of the £lO shares issued originally—-200 of
them to the promoter, the other 85 to the
public for working exes.; the remaining 15
were later put out at a premium of £990
apiece. The invention, which is to revolution-
ise the world’s power and lighting, is still, so
far as the public is concerned, a matter of
whispers; but the lid is to be taken off the
secret very soon. Till then it will be inter-
esting to watch the course of the market and
to speculate upon the length to which the
public’s leg can be stretched.
“Fossicker”: The first shot in the cam-
paign to test Dr. Jack’s theory of alluvial
gold deposits under the desert sandstone of
the Palmer River (N.Q.) has been fired from
London. It was a cable to the Queensland
Mines Department asking that diamond-
drilling plant be made available to bore
through the stone to get at the gold. Jack,
in suggesting that payable gold might be
obtained in the conglomerate wash under the
sanclstone, specifically stated that it would
be a waste of money to go blind-stabbing
through 400 ft. of sandstone when the gold-
bearing stuff is exposed at its base. The
correct method would be to drive along the
gutters where they are exposed at the base
of the cliffs. Jack’s party mapped the line
of cliffs for over 50 miles and showed where
it was auriferous. It is to be hoped that
plans will be reversed, because the London
market is already a little shy of N.Q. ven-
tures owing to the recent failure of a tin-
bearing proposition.
* h* * *
Rockhampton (Q.) has responded to the
call for capital to prove the new Mt. Cassidy
lode. A local syndicate has bought out the
greater part of the prospectors’ interest, and
is prepared to spend up to £5OOO in testing
the show. A 20-ton crushing at a Gympie bat-
tery returned the prospectors ,9|dwt. per ton.
The ore was from the cap of the lode and
probably included some of the low-grade cas-
ing rock. The geologist’s sampling showed
that in one cross section of the ore body a
width of Bft. had a value of 15dwt. gold per
ton, and about 7dwt. per ton over a width
of 20ft. These are very fair values indeed
for a wide body; everything will depend
upon costs.
* * * *
Wiluna’s big gold extraction plant is
completed, and is billed to kick off very
shortly. The milling grade of the ore is ex-
pected to be at least 355. a ton, and an ex-
traction of 83 per cent, or more is hoped for.
Working costs, on wihch everything hangs,
are estimated at 19s. per ton. The plant is
designed to treat over 40,000 tons a month,
but it will probably be late in the year before
that figure is reached.

Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) output figures for
January are interesting. Total expenditure
was £14,581; bullion recovery was valued at
£14,349. Taking the exchange premium at
245. lOd. per fine ounce, and the bonus as
worth 6s. Bd., the result of the month’s opera-
tions is changed from a loss of £232 to a
profit of over £5OOO, equal to over £60,000
per annum on an issue of 325,000 shares.

The Westralian Minister for Mines has
reserved 250 acres on Fraser’s line of lode.
Southern Cross, which suggests that capital
may presently be asked for to give the field
another trial. The five batteries, aggregat-
ing nearly 100 stampers, w T hich were kept
busy in the field’s hectic days, have been
silent of recent years. Fraser’s mine was
the pick of the group; its best performance
being a run of 13 monthly divs. of sixpence.
* * * *
After consultation with producers the
Malayan, Dutch, Nigerian and Bolivian Gov-
ernments have approved a scheme to restrict
the export of tin to 78 p.c. of the 1929
output, and legislative action in the respec-
tive countries is awaited. The idea is to
gradually absorb existing stocks of the metal
which have broken down the market. Plants
coming into production since 1929 are to
be allowed a quota on the basis of 78 p.c. of
their capacity; the tin content of the ground
will also be taken into consideration. Group
quotas will be allowed, which means that
organisations controlling a number of
plants may be able to close down some
dredges and work others at maximum capa-
city. Malaya considers that the restriction
should apply to production as well as exports,
but there is opposition to this in the other
producing countries. No arrangements have
been made so far with the Siamese Govern-
ment, but it is not anticipated that there will
be any difficulty l there.

QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
What is the position of ord. and pref.
shareholders in the Mercantile Bank of Aus-
tralia?—llol.
The liquidator’s legal rights against cer-
tain persons who benefited under contracts
with the co. are still in doubt. If these
claims are good in law and can be recovered
in casln a call of about £2i will be made on
ord. shares; if the action is unsuccessful,
the amount to be called will be £3 10s. or
thereabouts. These calls are to repay the
pref. capital, which the Master in Equity
has decided must be returned in full. The
premiums on the prefs. have definitely gone.
Will shareholders in the Aust. Group and
General Life Go. receive any benefit from
the recent sale of their business to the
Southern Cross Co.? —-1056.
The Australian Group Co. is being wound
up. A return of capital to shareholders will
depend on the amount realised for the
remaining assets, and whether the shares
held are fully paid. No estimate is possible
at this juncture.
Is Photomaton, Ltd. (in liquidation) likely
to return anything to shareholders? —1113.
A repayment of Is. in the £1 is to be made
shortly, and a further small distribution is
possible.
Present position of New Guinea Gold and
Exploration C0.? —1164.
New Guinea Gold and Exploration has
sold its properties to New Guinea Gold-
fields, Ltd., for shares. These have been
distributed, according to original holdings,
among shareholders in N.G.G. and Ex.,
except for some 600 f.p. £1 shares represent-
ing fractions. These are to be sold, and the
returns, with other cash in hand, are to be
portioned out among the N.G.G. and Ex.
shareholders according to their rights.
(1) Original value of Nawng Pet (tin)
shares? (2) Do the shares carry any lia-
bility? (3) Prospects? —l24l.
(1) One Straits dollar (2s. 4d.). (2)
No. The 500,000-dollar shares are all issued
and fully paid up. (3 and 4) Quite good.
Directors reported that at September 1,
1929, the co-. was free of debt, apart from
sundry trade creditors. The area remaining
for working is considerable, and leases have
14 years yet to run. Values have always
been high, but_ costs very heavy, mainly
owing to the mine’s liability to flooding out
in the monsoons. It is a sluicing, not a
dredging, show.
(1) How and where can I obtain a
miner’s right in Victoria? (2) How to be-
come eligible for. the gold bonus? (3) Cost
of miner's right? (4) How do Igo about
pegging out a claim, size of same and must
I register it? (5) What particulars must 1
give the registrar? (6) Is prospecting per-
mitted on forest reserves and similar un-
occupied areas, or only on special areas?
(7) Where can I get information of areas
abandoned about 50 years ag0? —1499.
(1) By spoken or written application to
Under-Treasurer, Melbourne, or to Clerk of
Courts, any mining district. (2) Particu-
lars re gold bonus may be obtained from any
Customs office. (3) 2s. 6d. per year; any
number of years from one to 15. (4) Get
from Mines Department, Melbourne, copy of
mining by-laws, which contains full details
as to pegging out, size of claims, registra-
tion, etc. (5) Registrar for division in
which the claim is situated. See mining
by-laws fo-r directions. (6) The holder of
a miner’s right may take up claims for pros-
pecting or any other form of mining on
Crown lands not specially exempted from
mining and on private land; but no mining
can be done on private land until terms
with the owner have been arranged. (7)
By inquiries locally.
Hoiv to tell amount of free gold in a reef
by dollying process? —ls39.
Crush a weighed sample in a dolly-pot,
wash in a pan in the usual way, and work
out the quantities per ton from the weight
of the gold won. For instance, if you
crush 101 b. of stone, the gold value per ton
will he the quantity of gold panned off mul-
tiplied by 224 (2240 divided by 10). A
dolly-pot can be made by welding a piece
of sheet-iron to one of the open ends of a
15in. length of Gin. iron piping. A 2ft.
length of drill steel can be used for crush-
ing the stone.
Agents are shipping our goods to England
for sale. They make advances as shipped,
and send the surplus on sale. When and on
what is the exchange payable? —l67B.
On the advance at the rate for the day on
which it is paid; on the surplus at the rate
for the day on which it is remitted to
Australia. Each lot of exchange is included
with the payment to which it relates.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
J.M.P.: A note issue requires only the
backing of “sufficient” gold. What is sufficient is,
of course, a matter of opinion. In Australia it was
fixed at 25 p.c.; the balance has to be represented
by securities.... Mack: You could send notes, but
it is a clumsy and rather dangerous way. Your
local bank should do it for you Subscriber: (1)
Can’t say. (2) Risky. (3) Send your £2O share
to Mt. Isa Co., Asbestos House, Sydney, which will
forward in exchange 20 shares in Mt. Isa, worth
each about 19s. at present R.L.H.: Something to
do with funds in London... .C.E.8.: All a gamble
till the sky clears a little. Leave it where you
can get at it quickly... .E.A.S.: You don’t tell us
what co it is... .M.E.H.: Position too uncertain.
Take a short term deposit... .F.S.F.: (1) If you
want a gamble, yes; if safety is important, no.
(2) No difficulty about buying. (3) Not listed
among saleable minerals... .Anxious: Ask for a
balance-sheet under threat of discontinuing your
policy. If a satisfactory statement is not forth-
coming, ask for a paid-up policy. We have not been
able to obtain recent accounts H.H.P.: No hope
for any return to Smith and Waddington ord. share-
holders, Prospects of the prefs. depend on amalga-
mation.

Report (condensed) of the Royal Commis-
sion on the Melbourne Theatrical Blasphemy
Case:—
This Commission was appointed at the
instance of a small but influential section to
inquire into accusations of blasphemous con-
duct towards the Depression at certain
houses of resort known as theatres. It was
alleged that after a period of respectable
behavior these institutions had suffered a
change, called by their owners a Renais-
sance of Gaiety. It had been alleged that
people had been seen to smile and even heard
to laugh outright within their precincts,
stimulated thereto by the actions of persons
of dubious morality known as actors. It
was alleged that these actors never men-
tioned the Depression, or, if they did, made
irreverent allusions to it. Moreover, when
off duty they repeated these allusions, with
certain qualifying adjectives, in the neigh-
boring bars, to the accompaniment of appre-
ciative laughter.
It was claimed that, as a result of the
above, disaffection was spreading, and mem-
bership of die League for Studying the De-
pression, the Never Say Die League, the Keep
On Smiling League, the Are We Down-
hearted League and the League for Instruct-
ing Babies in the Awful Truth about the
Depression was falling off.
The Commission was required (1) to
ascertain whether this blasphemous conduct
had in truth occurred; (2) if it had, to dis-
cover the reason why; and (3) to suggest
measures for its immediate suppression.
The Commission occupied 49 days,
and examined 1001 persons, whose evidence
filled 3,000,035 closely-printed foolscap pages.
On behalf of the allegators against the
theatres the Reverends Bodkins, Sniffers and
Godge were unanimous in declaring that
conditions as claimed actually existed, and
probably worse. Absolutely untroubled
laughter was constantly to be heard at
the Royal, where “Sons o’ Guns” was being
“He did not belong to
the Are We Down-
hearted or any other
league.”
performed.
Carefree mirth
was just as pre-
valent at the
Tivoli. For
obvious reasons
they preferred
not to speak of
“T he First
Mr s. Fraser,”
at the Comedy,
though it could
be taken for
granted that
practically the
same state of
affairs pre-
vailed there and
the more shame-
ful, too, because
the audience
was said to be
of a more cul-
tured kind.
None of these
per formances
was calculated
to arouse the
people to a real-
isation of the
dreadful cloud
that hung over the land.
Cross-examined by counsel for Messrs.
E. and J. Tait, Mr. Bodkins said that he
believed the people should worry more than
they did. Il'e believed in worry, and not
merely because he was paid for worrying.
Worry was good for one. Personally he wor-
ried about everything. It worried him to
think of a man enjoying a glass of beer.
When the beer was completely taken away,
which he prayed would be soon, he would
probably worry over people drinking tea. If
we all started worrying twice as much about
the Depression it would soon come right.
What had the poet said about divine dis-
content?
Rev. Pudgkins said he disagreed pro-
foundly with the previous witness, although
they were more or less of the same cloth.
What the people of the great enlightened
community which had called him to be their
spiritual leader needed was more Joy. Joy
was the cement of life, the arttiphlogistine
of gloom. It was Joy that had made the
British Empire what it was. He strongly
believed in' Joy, provided always that it was
Joy of the Right Kind. He would be unable
to say whether the Joy provided by the
theatres was the Right Kind until after he
had attended the next Lambeth Conference.
Cross-questioned, the right reverend wit-
ness admitted that wliat he had said was
entirely composed of amiable platitudes.
That was what he understood imported
reverends were for.
E. J. Hogan said that as Premier and
Treasurer of the State he had been care-
fully watching developments in the theatrical
line. He counselled caution in approaching
the problem of a renaissance of the drama.
It would be wrong to suppress it while it
was possible to tax it.
On behalf of the theatres only one wit-
ness was called. John Smith said he was
an occasional theatregoer. He went when
he felt like it and he didn’t worry much
what was on. He did not belong to the
Are We Downhearted League or any other
league. He didn’t feel the need. He didn’t
believe in worrying even about his own
affairs, let alone the affairs of the Common-
wealth. He didn’t believe in worrying or
even thinking about a thing except when
you could do something about it. He was
once threatened with bankruptcy, and he
worried about it day and night. That
made him go bankrupt all the sooner because
if he hadn’t worried himself silly during the
nights he would have been fitter to tackle
his business in the daytime. It was the
same with affairs of State. He wasn’t
going to worry about Theodore or Gullett
or Scullin or Beasley or any of those blokes
—not until next election day.
Questioned by counsel for Messrs. Tait,
he said too right Elsie Prince was a peach,
and he never remembered seeing Gus Bluett
in better form. Also Bertha Riccardo was
good-o. He had no derry on the talkies, but
what with Ethel Morrison at the Comedy and
Minnie Love at the Tiv. and Toti Dal Monte
coming back, legit, had it all over the movies
in one respect. It was three-dimensional,
if they knew what he meant. Patrons of
“If we all started worrying
twice as much the depres-
sion would soon come
right.”
the talkies
were always
g r u m b ling
about some-
thing. For in-
stance, they
comp lained
about the un-
c o mfortable-
ness of the
front - stall
seats. He had
heard no com-
plaints from
patrons of
legit, front
seats.
After exam-
i nin g the
1101 wit-
nesses the
Com mission
visited the
four leading
theatres. It
found that all
the allegations
were substan-
tially true and
submitted the following recommendations:
(1) On the analogy of the moving-
picture theatres, where spontaneous laugh-
ter is seldom heard, it should be made
compulsory for all legitimate produc-
tions to be performed in the dark; (2)
it should be obligatory on the management to
hand a copy of the current “Argus” leader to
every member of an audience ; (3) references
to the Depression should be prohibited; (4)
if these measures failed, the theatres should
be closed.

“Galsworthy’s “The Fugitive,” staged by
the Beresford Fowlers before a full house at
the Queen’s, Melbourne, recounts how Clare
Dedmond left her home because of a dull
husband; how she found London a hard and
a wicked place for a separated married woman
to live in; how Malise, a writer, took her in
and eventually fell in love with her; how her
husband offered her £3OO a year to live apart
from Malise; how, rather than subsist on her
husband’s money, she went on the streets;
and how she destroyed the peace of mind of
a deserving cafe proprietor by taking a fatal
dose of poison in the dining-room just as the
guests were arriving.
The politest comment THE Bulletin can
make concerning the eminent English novel-
ist’s treatment of the above story is that he
must have been subsidised by Metro-Goldwyn
to help increase the popularity of the talkies.
Nowhere does the writing rise above the
level of police-court reporting, and character-
isation is barely suggested. In places Gals-
worthy endeavors to impart humor but fails
egregiously. In the actual performance,
however, this omission was repaired by the
presence on the stage of Mr. Beresford Fow-
ler. As the writer Malise, Mr. Fowler was
supposed to be a terrific dog of a fellow, a
reckless disregarder of the conventions. Mr.
Fowler suggested a lay-reader unaware that
he was reading the lesson from a copy of
Bernard Shaw’s “Joan” instead of the Bible.
Nor did he rise fully to the occasion as a
Great Lover when Clare Dedmond fell into
his arms. He behaved as if part of the
scenery had unexpectedly collapsed on him.
Nor did the loud smacking noises that
emerged from the embrace help to create the
illusion of overmastering passion. This was
not fair to Linda Newcombe, who, besides
being a very personable young woman, acted
with much brilliance; in fact, she was the
sole real person amidst a cloud of very palp-
able Melbourne amateurs. Most of the latter
ranted. An exception was Reg Clark as a
tobacconist; He seemed to be fully employed
holding hig whiskers in place with his teeth.
Mrs. Leon. White, as Lady Dedmond, acted
quietly.

An hour or so before the Maoriland
earthquake relief concert at Sydney Town
Hall it rained cats and dogs, and
the little band of heroes and heroines
that attended was so small and so
divided that the hall looked bigger than
usual. The audience heard the National
Anthem twice —once as Sir Philip Game
came in and again as he went out —and the
programme opened with the “Dead March
in Saul,” a tribute to the memory of the
Hawkes Bay victims. Dr. Orchard and
Alfred Hill took turns in conducting the
Uni. Con. Orchestra, which played bits from
Wagner and Weber, and L. G. Smith was
soloist in a spirited performance of the G
minor pianoforte concerto of Saint-Saens.
“It worried him to think of a man enjoying
a glass of beer.”
Spencer Thomas, Virginia Bassetti and
Madame Alice Goossens sang; Frank Hut-
chens and Lindley Evans played sweetly on
two pianos, and there were two violinists
and a choir. E. J. Gravestock, who engin-
eered the show, says it wasn’t such a finan-
cial failure as it looked. A lot of tickets
were bought that weren’t used, and about
£l5O will go to the fund.
“Lilac Time,” revived as a stop-gap at
Sydney Majesty’s, has given the Firm one
of the shocks of its young life. For no
reason that anyone competent to make
theatrical forecasts can discover, it has
proved a rattling success, so much so that the
season has been extended to March 6.
On the 7th “Dearest Enemy” will replace it.
The Firm has no complaints over the
reception of “On the Spot” either. It is
doing capital business at the Cri.
* * *
Rolls did his bit towards helping the
earthquake sufferers by putting on a show at
Sydney St. James on Friday midnight, an
unholy hour to wish upon a crowd as bereft
of transport as Sydney folk are in the small
hours. Part of the show was “Topsy Turvy”;
the rest was provided by leading performers
from other theatres.
Nat Phillips carries on at Sydney Opera
House undaunted by De Presh. On Saturday
he changed his vaudeville programme, called
it “Showers of Fun” and’ added Syd Beck to
the strong bunch he had already gathered
about him. The bunch now includes Beck,
Joe Lawman, June Mills and a dozen others,
not to mention sundry legs.
•fr
Amy Rochelle, leaving “The Belle of New
York,” joined the “Jack Built” panto, co.
at Adelaide Royal to get acquainted, and
will be principal boy in M.L. Sadie Gale,
lately in the part, has hardly the dashing
manner appropriate to it. Nell Taylor is
better suited as the Girl, and Mona Zeppel
does some good dancing with Eric Bush.
Business has been big.

After a plucky fight against the inevitable
the Yie. Professional Orchestra has decided
to disband. The three last performances
netted eight shillings per player; there were
times when members did not make their tram-
fares to St. Kilda. Most of the concerts
being on Sundays, admission was by silver
coin, and on one occasion 800 music-lovers
considered threepence to be a fair return for
the services of what Alfred Hill declared to
be the finest combination in Australia.
An outbreak of “Hay Fever” is prognosti-
cated at Melbourne Tivoli, commencing on
Saturday. The Wilkie-Hunter-Wattses will
essay Noel Coward’s glittering comedy. On
the same day, after 67 appearances as “The
First Mrs. Fraser,” Ethel Morrison will make
her bow as the Mrs. Morland of Barrie’s
“It was three-dimensional, if they knew
what he meant.”
“Mary Rose.” At the Royal “Sons o’ Guns”
is still endeavoring to conceal its American
origin with more or less success, but the
impression is that Leo Franklyn’s Digger is
funny without being Australian.
Poverty Point
“Ex-Englishman”: An odd sign of the
times is the firm re-establishment of the good
old Shakspearean word “bawdy,” banned
for a century past. The hero of the very-
English “Constant Nymph” uses it cheerfully
to the heroine when describing an acquaint-
ance ; and in New York it is now—and with
good reason —a commonplace of theatrical
criticism.
“Jaeky Roo” (Lond.) : Lance Fairfax,
who was effusively taken up by theatrical
knight Butt and boomed as leading man for
the new Drury-lane show “The Son of the
Drum,” was suddenly dropped during re-
hearsals and Derek Oldham has his part.
Australia is well represented in the show by
Clarice Hard wick e and Marie Burke. Annie
Croft is playing Gladys Moncrieff’s old part
in the Dalys’ revival of “The Maid of the
Mountains.” Londoners are very faithful to
their old war-time love.
“Cauboy”: Here is the prospectus for
the 1931 virtuoso season. Scottish tenor
Hislop, opening under Tait management in
Melbourne in April; Russian violinist
Mischa Levitzki, under E. J. Gravestock
control, opening same town same month;
Slav violinist Zlatko Balokovic, starting in
Sydney in June; Australian baritone Peter
Dawson and pianist Mark Ilambourg, in
May; Kreisler, Toti dal Monte and hus-
band Lamonto, not yet fixed. This will
make the year almost as musically memor-
able as 1927, when Melba, Friedman, Heifetz,
Zimbalist, Alda and half a dozen other
world-famous ones queued at Melbourne
Auditorium and Sydney Town Hall for
standing room on the platform.
“Elderly Infant” ; One of the world’s great
pianists, though he wasn’t recognised as such
save in inner musical circles, was Leonard
Borwick, the quiet, unobtrusive little Eng-
lishman who toured Australasia in the first
decade of the century. He was a gentle
soul, and never unleashed anything as loud
as what Hambourg, or even Carreno, would
have considered a mezzo-forte. He played
as they say Chopin did—his pianissimo such
a whisper that his more robust tones sounded
fierce in comparison. I had a long chat with
him —almost all about photography, by the
way—and only at the end did I get him to
talk about music. He leaned towards me
confidentially, looked around apprehensively
to make sure that his manager wasn’t in the
offing, and said: “I hate programmes! A
pianist should never be tied to a programme.
Sometimes I feel like playing—oh, fiery, mar-
tial music—and I must play nocturnes and
elegies; and then on another night, when I
am homesick and sad. I must play mazurkas
and mad dances. Why can’t I please my-
self?”
“When off duty they repeated these
allusions.”
“Cauboy” : When will theatrical producers
learn that plays written for the unsophis-
ticated theatregoer of pre-film days are fore-
doomed to failure? Anybody could have told
the Firm that “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” at Mel-
bourne King’s would be a painful experience
for the box-office. I remember a silent film
version of the venerable bromide in which
millions of tons of real water and ice figured.
Under the circumstances, the Firm’s nightly
pound of rice gave forth a hollow sound. I
was assailed by the same empty feeling
when surveying the march past of the Allied
armies in “Sons o’ Guns” at the Royal the
other night. The time is past when the
effect of a vast concourse can be conveyed
by the device of making a handful of supers
walk slowly across the stage and then double
swiftly back behind the baekelofh and come
on again. In the case of “Sons o’ Guns,”
the illusion was further interfered with when,
in reply to the usual protest from the
Theatrical Employees’ Association about the
non-employment of unionists, the Firm ex-
plained that “fourteen supers were, required
to march on the stage, ten having been
engaged through the R.S.L., and the remain-
ing four were either members of the chorus
or the union.”
“Say Bio”: The Firm’s '“House That
Jack Built” is to tour Maoriland. Half
the profits are to go to earthquake relief.
“Limelight” : The coming Gilbert and Sul-
livan revival reminds me that once when
Gilbert was conducting a rehearsal he missed
his wife, who had accompanied him to the
theatre. “Have you seen my wife?” he
asked, abruptly, of the co. “She’s round
behind,” said one of the chorus. “Yes,”
said the librettist, “I know that; but where
is she?”
Leslie Rees (Lond.) : Vance Palmer, writ-
ing of the London Theatre in a Bulletin
that has just reached me, suggests that it
ought to take a 10-years’ holiday. What sort
of impression can Mr. Palmer expect to
pick up if he chooses to judge the theatre
here during the summer slump? Any insti-
tution must be judged by its best, and of
course the London theatre is at its best
during its well-defined annual season. This
season opens with a bang in September and
continues until April or May. Take the
theatre at the moment of writing! Apart
from St. John Ervine’s “The First Mrs.
Fraser” the highbrow can go to “The Play-
boy of the Western World”; Elmer Rice’s
“Street Scene”; “The Toy Cart,” a Nigel
Playfair production of an ancient Indian
play ; a revival of Dryden’s “Marriage a la
Mode”; “Richard II.”; “The Barretts of
Wimpole-street,” a trenchant drama by
Rudolph Besier dealing with Browning.and
Elizabeth Barrett; and Goldoni’s comedy
“The Liar.” Other West End plays just
past or promised in a week or so are
Molnar’s “The Swan,” two Lennox Robin-
son plays, “Richard III.” and “Henry 1V..”
“The Jealous Wife,” “The Wild Duck,” “The
Tempest,” “Peter Pan,” “Miss Julie”
(Strindberg) and a new play by Ashley
Dukes. It may
be ob j e c ted
that nearly all
of these pieces
are revivals.
But at what
period in the
history of the
theatre were
notable plays
so prolific as
to .be gracing
the boards
half a score at
a time? Dur-
ing a little
over half of
the last
theatre season
(from Janu-
ary to the end
of May) I
went to TO
plays in Lon-
don. These 70
did not include
“No complaint from
patrons of legit, front
seats.”
more than five farces and plays of strictly
amusement value only. They were not all
first-class West End productions. They
included repertory shows of Shaw and Gals-
worthy and Strindberg, and even half a
dozen well-done amateur shows. But this
was the offering of the London Theatre. I
saw plays from Euripides to Farquhar, from
O’Casey to George Kaiser. Ever since the
theatre existed, people have been saying that
it is going to the dogs.
“Rodriguez”: Frederick C. Smith, better
known as Fred Coape, has taken his last
cue at Murwillumbah (N.S.W.), aged 57. A
good character actor, he was in Muriel
Starr’s company for years. Fred was
the murderous butler of “The Donovau
Affair” at Sydney Palace in 1925. Like many
another good actor, he was put out of a job
by the talkies, and was playing in a tent
show when he died.


I.
THE MILKBOY (Teddy Theodore): “Our old loan cow’s gone dry, Missus, and
you’ll have to take less milk.”
THE MISSUS: “But I can’t. I MUST have my usual quantity. I couldn’t do with a
drop less.”
TEDDY: “Oh, awright. If you must, I suppose you must!”
II.
TEDDY: “Well, thank Gawd, if we can’t give her milk, we can give her water and
CHARGE her for milk.”
BUSINESS, ROBBERY, ETC.
Exchange Rates and the Nation
Dear Bulletin, —The present exchange
rates are not economic rates; they are panic
rates, and the further the banks chase the
outside houses the greater will be the dis-
organisation of public and private finance.
The remedy is so simple that it could be
applied immediately with practically no
interference with ordinary commerce. The
Federal Government possesses the necessary
powers under the Trade and Customs Act.
The export of any article can be prohibited
unless the Customs Department is satisfied
that the shipper has lodged bills with one
of the banks, which could issue a certificate
to the shipper; on production of the certi-
ficate the export would be allowed. This
would automatically give complete control
of all London exchange to the banks. The
banks would then be in a favorable position
to meet all the requirements of the Govern-
ments in London, and also to give considera-
tion to applications from private individuals
for London funds. Their inability under
present conditions to give substantial assist-
ance to private firms has contributed to the
insane race for exchange which has become
a Gilbertian feature of Australian finance.
The increase in the rates was supposed
to have given some benefit to the primary
producers, but it is extremely doubtful if
this is the case. So far as the wool market
is concerned the sudden and steep increases
undoubtedly had a disturbing effect on
European centres, and accentuated a fall in
sterling wool values which has only added to
the already serious difficulties confronting
the banks in their attempts to honor their
undertakings to the Governments. Wheat
values in Australian currency have not
advanced one farthing since December, despite
that the oversea wheat markets have
remained steady and the exchange rates have
been raised by about 22 per cent. The high
rates, according to the theorists, should have
enabled Australia to secure the Army meat
contract, but this has proved to be an illu-
sion. In point of fact, the whole thing is
an illusion. It is unfortunately a very ex-
pensive one for Australian citizens, who will
have to provide at the present rates of ex-
change nearly £11,000,000 per annum for the
purpose of transferring interest payments to
London.
There are complications, too, from the ex-
porter’s point of view. The present rates
may last for a short or long period. It is a
matter of speculation. But there have been
rumors that rates may be lowered. The
position of the exporter, immediately there
is any uncertainty about the rates at which
he can sell his drafts, becomes precarious.
He does not know on what basis to work.
He is faced with an exchange risk which is
difficult to cover owing to the absence in
Australia of a forward exchange market. He
can secure himself by arranging for money
to be telegraphed to his account in Aus-
tralia ; but there are objections to this
method of financing exports on a large scale.
The banks might help him by guaranteeing a
certain rate for a definite period. If it were
not possible for them to fix a rate for some
time ahead, they might allow the exporter
to put his drafts in daily without support-
ing documents, and so cover his purchases
from day to day at the prevailing rate. If
something of this sort is not done and there
is no system of control introduced, the next
stage of this business will see the develop-
ment of an outside forward exchange market,
and the banks will be in danger of losing the
exchange business as the rates fall.
The whole history of the movements and
effects of exchange rates affords no grounds
for believing that high rates are of any sub-
stantial benefit to a country which has to
meet large annual overseas obligations. The
sooner the truth of this is recognised the
quicker will be the. economic and financial
reconstruction which has already been de-
layed too long. Let us not forget that Sir
Otto Niemeyer warned the Australian Gov-
ernments that high exchange rates would
prejudice the whole fabric of national
finance. —Yours, David A. S. Campbell.
Let’s Have Another Bawra!
Dear Bulletin, —From 1926 to 1980 cer-
tain decreases were made in the expenses of
wool-growing and marketing throughout
Queensland: Station-hands’ wages, 38 p.c.;
wool carriage, 25 p.c.; woolpacks, 25 p.c.;
shearing wages, 12J p.c.; rations, 10 p.c.;
rail freight wool, 10 p.c. In spite of these
reductions, on the market price of wool
to-day there is a loss of something like 3s.
per sheep.
Australian wool appears to be required by
Europe and other parts of the world. Very
well; let Australia dictate the value of wool
clips. The banks and other financial institu-
tions are so heavily involved in the pastoral
industry that it would pay them to pool and
take over the coming season’s clip and dis-
pose of it at a payable price. If other
nations are not prepared to pay a reasonable
price on the best costs we can do at the
moment, then it is not our fault if we are
a like proportion short in our annual interest
payments.
A fair average price to the grower would
be Is. 3d. per pound, for a reserve must be
created to cover droughts, etc.
There is other wool on the market, but the
world requires a great proportion of the
Australian clip, and we must let our creditors
understand that unless we get a fair price
our obligations must to a certain extent be
held in abeyance.—Yours etc., Drowning.
Power Alcohol
Dear Bulletin, —I am sorry to disillusion
recent Bulletin correspondents about_ the
cost of power alcohol, but the fact is it
cannot be manufactured for Is. per gallon.
Further, while it can be marketed as a
“straight” fuel to be used in standard
engines, it is only after adjustments have
been made, such as adding hot air to the
air intake, and changing over to very much
larger jets.
The consumption of pure alcohol in a
normal engine is 1.8 times greater than it
would be for petrol. So, if petrol is sold at
2s. 3d., alcohol must be sold at Is. 3d. —a
price that makes the proposition impossible.
On the other hand, if alcohol is mixed with
petrol in certain proportions it is possible
to obtain a blend that compares more than
favorably with first-class petrol.
Alcohol has two main characteristics: (1)
a low calorific value; (2) a high thermal
efliciency. When alcohol is mixed with
petrol in the same proportions as in Shellkol
(Queensland’s fuel), the thermal efliciency
of the mixture is raised to such an extent
that the small loss in calorific value of the
fuel, due to the presence of alcohol, is more
than counterbalanced ; consequently the mile-
age is actually increased, and not decreased
as might be expected.
Alcohol is a solvent for shellac; and,
although it will not affect engine gaskets,
it will sometimes remove the coating from
cork carburetter floats. This may be easily
remedied by substituting animal glue for the
shellac. —Yours, G. Gray Barnard, General
Manager Australian National Power Alcohol
Co.
Our Wool Marketing
Dear Bulletin, —Australia grows most of
the world’s clothing wools, and for quality
we have no rivals; but through lax market-
ing methods we are selling our goods a lot
below production costs, and the country is
being slowly strangled. With S. Africa we
have 90 per cent, of the world’s marketable
merino wool, and yet we let the buyers fix
the price. The so-called advisory council,
remarkable for its preponderance of heads of
wool firms, coupled with the president o|
the Graziers’ Association, is trying to side-
track the public on this question; but the
public is not going to be bluffed so easily.
The world’s production of wool is approx.
10,000,000 bales. Of this a little over
5,000,000 bales are carpet wools ; and Aus-
tralasia produces 3,000,000 of the world’s
best quality. It is admitted that there is no
carry-over and the wool is up to the mills
all the time, or a bit behind them, as the
world’s population doubles itself every 30-
odd years. Yet we cannot sell it for the
price of kapok. The talk of substitutes is
mostly bluff. Thus artificial silk cannot be
produced at anything like the price of wool;
“art” silk averages over ss. per pound in
yarn, and mixed with wool it costs on an
average over 10s. per pound.
U.S.A. sells her wool with a fixed starting
price of one dollar per pound (clean scoured).
If we got this we could pay all our debts
and look the world in the face. Will someone
tell us what fs to stop us if we market the
product in the proper manner and scrap
the century-old method that has got us into
this mess? But there is no time to waste.
The sheep are deteriorating; soon it will
take years and years to get them back to
standard. Won’t someone take a hand?
Australia has the worst system of wool
marketing in the world to-day from the
grower’s standpoint, and a wonderful one
from the buyers.—Yours, F. C. Deakins.
Now It Is Tea’s Turn
“Nakhoda”: With the drop in prices white
tea-growers arc finding themselves in the
same predicament as rubber-growers. The
key to the problem is in the hands of the
kampong or village producers. When British
planters decided to restrict rubber in Malaya,
the Dutch Government refused to come into
the arrangement because it did not believe
that it would lead to much of a rise in
prices. The natives then proceeded to plant
seedlings in their back yards, and in due
course their product began to have a definite
effect on stocks. This settled the attitude
of the Dutch Government, which is always
disinclined towards legislation that will
favor the handful of whites if there is
danger of disgruntling the 60 millions of
brown people in their immense and badly
policed dominions. One weapon a disaffected
native community . can use is murder of
white estate-overseers. There were 32 such
attempts in Sumatra last year, and they
are difficult to stop without an enormous
constabulary. The tea-growers’ conference
at Amsterdam decided to continue restriction
at 8 p.c., but declared that it was impossible
to enforce restriction on natives, who simply
took their product to Chinese factories. Last
year native tea amounted to 36 million
pounds in the Dutch East Indies, while
white restriction lowered the picking by only
14 millions. The only hope for the white
growers, if prices don’t rise, is better
methods. The native is notoriously inefficient.
Prices of Farm Implements
“Wyalong”: Earle Page said these prices
have increased 100 p.c. in 20 years. He
would have been a good deal nearer the
truth if he had said 23 or 24 years. That
was the time the International Co. was
fighting McKay and dumping machines on
us. McKay induced William Dyne to stop
that assault; and we have never had such
a time since. Incidentally, Lyne was very
wild at the rise in prices, and had several
shots at reducing them ; but he never suc-
ceeded.
Fire Insurance and Earthquakes
In the outburst of sympathy which fol-
lowed the Napier disaster it was suggested
that the M.L. fire insurance cos. which
issued policies covering premises in Hastings
and Napier should, as a matter of benevo-
lence, pay out for losses caused by the fires
that were caused by the earthouakes in
those centres. It has been explained on
behalf of the cos. that it simply can’t be
done.
No insurance concern operating in the
Dominion retains more than a fraction of the
risk on its policies—the usual proportion is
about 21 per * cent., the remainder being
reinsured” with “treaty” cos. overseas. These
treaty cos. have no sentimental interest in
Maoriland, and will rest on their rights
under the policies. Since the ’Frisco ’quake
of 1906 every fire policy issued in the
Dominion excludes liability for “loss or
damage directly or indirectly, proximately
or remotely, occasioned or contributed to by
typhoon, hurricane, volcanic eruption, earth-
quake or other convulsion of nature or by
any consequence of any of the said occur-
rences.” The validity of that clause was
tested in a case following an earthquake in
Jamaica, which went to the Privy Council,
and the clause was upheld.
As practically all the sufferers of damage
by the Hawkes Bay upheaval neglected to
take out specific insurance against earth-
quakes, they are not covered.
Though Maoriland, by increasing pro-
duction and restricting imports, has
endeavored to counteract the slump in prices,
the trading figures for last year show that
the battle was a losing one. The value of
exports in 1930 was £10,638,000 less than
in the previous year, though the volume in
many important departments was greater,
and imports declined by only £5,772,000. The
balance of exports over imports, which in
1929 was £6,781,000, dwindled lasf year to
£1,914,000. The fall in wool prices, it is
estimated, accounted for £7,685,000 of the
reduction in export values..

“C.Q.” : Vic. Country Roads Board, which
is presided over by Major McCormack, is
feeling proud of itself. Some time ago it
set out to prove that lasting roads need not
be costly ones. It started by taking accu-
rate statistics of traffic on all roads, and
then devised a type to meet each circum-
stance. “Mixed in place” surfacing was
tried. It cost £7BO a mile. With this
method the stone and binding material are
laid down and mixed afterwards. Tests by
the rougliometer (recently described in The
Bulletin) showed, that parts of the Calder
Highway between Melbourne and Geelong
constructed this way stood up to punishment
better than the portions conlstructed by
older methods which cost £3OOO-odd per mile.
As a testimonial to the soundness of the
board’s methods, no less than three leading
British roadmen visited _ Victoria last year
to have a look at our highways.

“I’d give all I have t’ get her, Mister Gum-

“D. Downs”: The courage and resource
of the young Australian have often been re-
ferred to on this page, but unless it was
recorded before I was old enough to read
The Bulletin there hasn’t been a mention
of the most striking instance I ever heard of.
It happened in N. S. Wales in 1882. A team-
ster and his wife had built themselves a slab
hut in the heart of the dense forest that then
lay between Emu Creek and Eskdale. The
young couple had two children, both girls,
one two years old and the other ten months.
The father was often away for several days
at a time. On one of these occasions the
mother, after putting cows in a distant pad-
dock, got bushed on returning. For four
days and nights she wandered through the
forest, racked with fears for the safety of
the children she had left in the hut. At
daylight on the fifth day she staggered into
the stockyard of a settler miles away from
her home. She gasped out her story, and
a police sergeant galloped madly to the hut.
He found the children safe and sound, peace-
fully sleeping, the babe in its little sister’s
arms. Over them, guarding them from a
horde of pigs, stood the cattledog, which had
never left the hut. The two-year-old had
found bread and sugar in a cupboard, and
with these and some water she had fed the
baby and herself.

“N.A.W.”: There was a devil inside Mrs.
Ting,’ the wife of my house-boy. At any
rate that was the Siamese medicine man’s
diagnosis. The symptoms all pointed to it:
pains in the bingy, sleeplessness, depressed
feeling, etc. The medicine man’s remedy
was simple but efficacious. He placed the
head of a four-inch nail against the lady’s
forehead and struck the other end a hard
blow with a hammer. The devil fled on the
instant. Later that night the medicine man
received an emergency call to a similar case
and performed his “op.” again, and the evil
one fled as before. Can’t explain it, unless
it be that it is a principle of Siamese medical
practice that a headache a day keeps gastritis
away.

“Tanta-Iyga”: “Cygnis Insignis” (B.

is due in reference to the importation of
camels into South Australia. This is a note
from the late S. J. Stuckey’s diary: ‘T
proceeded to Adelaide with a mob of fat
cattle, and on Jan. 2, 1862, Mr. Elder, my
brother and I signed a deed of partnership,
I prepared to leave by the first mail steamer
to procure camels.” ‘ It was Stuckey who
proposed oonts for transport. He went to
India and made arrangements for the pur-
chase of the first lot. He journeyed again to
India in 1866 and returned with 31 Afghans,
124 camels, 31 donkeys, one quagga and
some birds. These went to the Lake Hope
run in which Stuckey Bros, were partners
with Thomas Elder,

“Up North”: The daddy of all trees in
the matter of girth waxes fat in Arnhem’s
Land. It looks more like an overfed elephant
sitting on its tail than a tree. A mushroom-
shaped flounce spreads out at about three
feet from the ground ; some of them run to

“Hamer”: A story much resembling
Jacob’s historical experiences with Laban
has been revealed in an action in a N.S.W.
North Coast township. Laban, in this
case, had more than two daughters, but
it was Leah and Rachel who were concerned
in the trouble. Working casually on the
farm, young Jacob had exhibited a fondness
for Rachel, whereupon Laban bargained
with Jacob that he should work for three
years at the rate of a pound a week, half of
which Laban was to bank for him ; at the
end of the three-years Jacob could have Rachel.
There was another hand who apparently was
bound by the same terms in respect of Leah,
THERE’S BEAUTY UNDER THE SKIN.
"‘Beauty’s only skin deep,’ she says to me. ‘Ho, is it?’ says I. ‘Look at the beautiful
rump steak bullicks has under their ’ides.’”
but he unexpectedly disappeared—and Rachel
with him. After that Jacob wanted his
money back, so to speak, and, not getting it,
sued. The defence put forward the rather
irrelevant plea that, as Leah was still there
to be married, there was no real breach of
the agreement; but Jacob got his verdict.
“Flytox” : A spot that is attracting many
Blue Mountains (N.S.W.) sightseers these
days is the Jamieson Valley, not far from
the Ivatoomba Falls. Here a great craggy cliff
known as the Dog-face
Rock is breaking up
and falling 1000 feet
or more. The first falls
occurred late last
month in the early
hours of the morning.
Thousands of tons of
rock fell, and the
thunder of their im-
pact woke people in
Ivatoomba. Most folk
who watch the pro-
cess of disintegration
do so at a safe dis-
tance, but there are
always a few daring
souls who swarm on
to the top of the cliff
itself, despite the fact
that it is furrowed for
a considerable dis-
tance back from the
brink with rifts and
fissures. The collapse
of the whole crag
won’t make much dif-
ference to the bed of
the Jamieson Valley,
which is big enough to hold a dozen times
as much rock in one spot without altering
its appearance.

“Rastus”: According to evidence recently
unearthed, Governor Macquarie had his
own methods of dealing with the rum
traffic conducted by the military gentlemen,
to which Bligh so strongly objected. lie
went into the business himself. A contract
dated August 31, 1812, between the Governor
and William Roberts, of Sydney, victualler,
calls for the making “perfect and complete”
and the finishing in a “good, safe, commo-
dious, effectual and workmanlike manner”
of George-street, Sydney, from Hunter-street
to Brickfield Hill. The consideration is
400 gallons of rum! Seven months were
allowed for the job, and there is a suggestion
that three bullocks (to be purchased from
the Government) were to be used. Road-
making was evidently a very cheap and
sketchy process in those days.

“Taurus”: The railway yard adjoining the

supply was in a dishevelled condition on

a bull. Not relishing the idea of immi-
nent execution it had escaped from its pen
the previous evening and wandered into a
park, where it was perfectly happy. Then
some officious porters and guards recaptured
it and imprisoned it in a small enclosure,
At dawn the noble animal hurdled the
fence, dashed right through a tennis court,
ripping through the screens at both ends as
though they were paper, and returned to
the station yard, where every one got under
cover. One man climbed a pillar of the
overhead bridge and stayed there quite a
long while. Seeing that all was quiet on
the western front, as it were, the bull

loped off to the police barracks. Possibly
he -wanted to lodge a complaint about his
abduction. Possibly he wanted to play
bull-fights with the cops. They, however,
were taking no chances, and a bullet between
the eyes was Mr. Bull’s portion. But he
wasn’t done yet Though mortally stricken
he charged full tilt into the bonnet of a
motor-truck and then lay still.

periodical rumors that the overlanding bunny
had turned up somewhere or other. In 189 S
it was reported that a rabbit had been killed
at Point Cloates, nearly 1000 miles north
of Perth and quite the most western point
of the continent, and a violent controversy
raged in the press as to whether it was a
bona-fide rabbit or not. The slayer dispatched
the pelt to Perth, where scientific authority
ruled that the mysterious animal was a dul-
gite, a small denizen of the wilds that is
said t 0 have once been fairly common m
the Nor’-West, but has gradually become a.
rarity. Probably the imported rabbit hasn t
reached Point Oldates yet, though lie may
have. I have been told that there have been
rabbits on some of the islands off the M est-
ralian coast for decades past, but, that when
loosed on the mainland they soon died out.
otherwise the march might have been from

LADIES OF LEISURE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The city lights flaring behind us
Must glitter and beckon in vain,
For pockets depleted remind us
That playtime is over again.
And musing on evenings of pleasure,
Half-way twixt a smile and a frown,
We think of the ladies of leisure
Who brightened our sojourn in town.
Those ladies alluring who meet us,
So charming in manner and poise,
They wouldn’t have ventured , to greet us,
“But you looked such respectable boys.”
A soft little hand’s gentle pressure,
A smile, and it straightway appears
Those wonderful ladies of leisure
Have longed for our friendship for years.
And that is the end and beginning,
For how can a bushman resist
The conquests so easy of winning,
The lips that seem made to be kissed?
Such moments and memories we treasure,
When the time of our frolic is o’er*
And the painstaking ladies of leisure
Have not left us very much more.
For when our finances have dwindled,
Veiled glances no longer invite;
The fires we imagined were kindled
Have flickered and died in a night.
Yet we’ve had our fun in full measure —
And what can he be but a churl
Who grudges the ladies of leisure
Their price for the holiday whirl?

From our Scottish correspondent:—
This year’s Caledonian championship has been
awarded to Sandy McSwizzle, an amateur gardener.
The winner, who was handed a sample cake of soap,
proved that during the preceding 12 months he had
borrowed all his seeds, plants, etc., and sold the
products to his wife (who is a Southron) at current
market prices. The function was marred by the

PRIZE ESSAY.
Melbourne is built on the Yarra, which
has proved a constant drain on its resources.
Some of the suburbs, notably Fitzroy, have
shot up very rapidly.
The main cable news concerns the pace of
the trams.
Every year the Melbourne Cup is held,
and the public pay to witness modern shear-
ing operations at Flemington. Many suffer
from shooting pains about this time.
The streets are wide, giving motorists
plenty of room to seek victims.
Flinders-street station is popular, but
Spencer-street is even more so. It is from
there that you leave Melbourne for Sydney.
The buildings are large and house the
sharks which are not found in the bay.

she replied, “and I doubt if you are the
correct weight for your height. As you

She paused, and then asked if I was deaf.
“A trifle,” I replied humbly. “I thought
so,” she resumed. “Note the position of

SEMAPHORE.
CHOOSING A COAT.
“My lady is tempted by the evening frock, but

Mrs. Bellevue-llill yawned divinely. She
then stretched —also divinely—and care-

second it had dropped from her inert fingers;
she was asleep. After a decent pause the
saleswoman shook her and proffered a bridge
coat. The thing was of a color as yet undis-
covered. It was repulsively bizarre, allur-
ingly ghastly. Mrs. Bellevue-llill almost
woke up. Then she allowed her perfectly
poised head to droop upon her arms. She

WITH OUR PRIMARY PRODUCERS.
Phillip-street orclrardists report that
although legal plums are not as plentiful
and luscious as last year, a good steady
trade is being done in writs, garnishee orders
and small-debts summonses, which will be
sufficient to keep the
industry going until
the new bank notes
are printed. These,
it is hoped, will
stimulate interest in
decrees absolute, and
lead to a general re-
vival of business.
In the opinion of
Mr. Lou Mordecai,
w T ho has probably
done more than any
man between Ivenso
and Bobbery Park to
improve the stamina
of the Australian
punter, the turf in-
dustry is in a bad
way. The Christmas
and New Year har-
vest was hardly
worth stripping, and
bags were far below
the f.a.q. standard
fixed by Tatt.’s.
Stockbrokers re-
port that their pro-
ducts are suffering
from the ravages of
wild cats, which have
mauled many of the
best lines. Too much
inter - breeding is
blamed for weaken-
ing their powers of
resistance,
A big falling-off in
the sowing of wild
oats is anticipated
this year, and many
young men will have
to postpone the
operation until _ their
fathers are in a
better position to finance them.
A bright note, however, comes from Parlia-
ment House, which reports that the output
of wind has if anything been increased since
the depression. Great things were expected
of the by-product Inflation, but it con-
tracted the “Parkes Blight” and there have
been few inquiries for it since.

STUFF TO GIVE EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
FEEDING WHEAT TO PIGS.
“Tuart” : Details of an interesting experi-
ment in feeding wheat to store pigs bought
to be fattened for sale as baconers are given
by C. P. Goulding, manager of the State
farm at Rutherglen, in the January number
of the Vie. “Journal of Agriculture”—now
enlarged and improved. The only feeds used
were crushed wheat, meat meal and skim
milk from the farm dairy; owing to the
limited area there was practically no graz-
ing. The pigs were, however, kept almost
entirely in the open, being provided with
thatched shelters and given the run of small
paddocks, with access to water and wallow-
mg-pools. A home-made self-feeder was in-
stalled ; it was found that self-feeding was
preferable to hand-feeding, inasmuch as it
gave the weaker pigs a better chance of
obtaining their share.
Results for 15 months (August, 1929,
to November, 1930) show that 62,8041 b. of
crushed wheat, 21201 b. of meat meal and
99,0001 b. of skim milk were fed to 247
pigs for a gain in weight of 24,3591 b. Feed
per pig per day worked out at 3.471 b. of
wheat and 0.281 b. of meat meal or a gallon
of skim milk, and the gain in weight, 1.351 b.
Expenditure amounted to £546, of which
£402 was for store pigs, £62 for skim milk
(calculated at l-|d. per gallon), £53 for
wages, £l4 for cartage and £l4 for meat
meal (at £l5 per ton). Sales realised £6BO,
and with 116 pigs on hand it is calculated
that 1064 bushels of wheat gave a net re-
turn of 4s. 9d. per bushel, the profit being
£250. And much of the wheat was small
and cracked; moreover, during part of the
period covered by the experiment pigs had
to be sold in markets which had slumped.
Mr. Goulding’s general conclusions are
very much to the point: “At the time of
writing a pig weighing about 901 b. live weight
can be purchased for about 17s. 6d. To
fatten this pig to 1801 b. would take about
four bushels of wheat at, say, 2s. 6d. per
bushel = 10s., 191 b. meat meal at ljd. = 2s. 4d.,
labor, 45., giving a total of 335. lOd. The
market price of a good pig 1801 b. live weight
is about 445. net; thus the profit would be
10s. 2d., although this profit would not be
expected in all cases. Therefore, at the
present low price of wheat it should be pos-
sible to market at least a portion of the
grain profitably by feeding to pigs; this
applies particularly in the case of damaged
grain for which f.a.q. price would not be
obtained.”
In another article in the same issue of the
“Journal” A. J. Gill recommends wheat-
farmers to breed pigs, pointing out that “with
litters of eight to fourteen twice a year a
large herd can be built up cheaply and
quickly,” and that “those bred on the farm
will usually thrive better than others.” He
also insists, as Bulletin contributors have
done, that it is when grain is fed to pigs
running on pasture that the best results are
obtained.
PRODUCTION OF PORK FOR EXPORT.
“Man o’ Kent” (Canterbury, Eng.) : I
was glad to see the par. (B. 12/11/’3O)
advocating the production of pork and bacon
for export. To pull Australia out of the
financial morass in which she is floundering,
the country must build up her primary indus-
tries. Now, owing to the restrictions imposed
by the British Board of Agriculture on pig-
keepers to prevent the spread of swine fever,
many farmers have cleared out their sties
altogether, so that to-day in England there
is a shortage of about threequarters of a
million pigs. This is a great chance for
Australia. I have a pamphlet introduced
to me by The Bulletin and issued by the
Roseworthy Agricultural College (S.A.),
w T hich can, I believe, be had for 3d., giving
an account of an experiment carried out
there to ascertain the cost of producing pork
per pound. This was found to work out
at 2|d. To-day with wheat almost unsale-
able, cheap offals and a good bed of lucerne,
pork should be produced at 2d. per pound
or less. Low freights and exchange in favor
of the exporter should all help to make the
production of pork and bacon a very profit-
able business.
OVERSTOCKING SMALL FARMS.
“Mallee Bird”: Farmers with small Malice
blocks on Eyre’s Peninsula (S.A.) can’t
understand why neighbors get Id. a pound
more for their wool, and squatters 2d. a
pound more; but the explanation is simple
enough. The squatters have as many miles of
land as they have acres, while the neighbors
referred to have a few hundred acres of
bush land to which they can move their sheep
for a spell. The small men have to confine
their sheep to paddocks that have been
eaten out, or to turn them on to the fallows
“to keep down weeds.” Weeds are few and
far between, but the sheep must stay there
because there is nowhere else to put them
until the first paddock of wheat is harvested;
then they get what is left in the horse pad-
dock. While the sheep are in bare paddocks
they lose condition. They stay near the
water all day, and wander about 'at night,
becoming dirty and cutting the paddocks in
toe-pads.
The idea is prevalent among these West
Coast farmers that they should keep sheep
in large numbers in order to pack the soil
for modern wheat-growing. In the beach
areas sheep loosen up rather than pack down
the soil. They certainly cause much sur-
face drift.
Farmers wfith small holdings should keep
fewer sheep and keep them well; then the
animals will pay. A hundred lambs from good
ewes kept in a good paddock are worth as
much at six months as 200 lambs from ewes
on starvation rations, and will go twice as
far for domestic purposes. There is always
a ready market for them. The smaller flocks
require less time and attention; they are
only half the expense to shear, and a better
price for the wool is assured.
Farmers from Fowler’s Bay to Port Lin-
coln have spent huge sums on stud rams and
ewes to improve their flocks; but 80 per cent,
of good breeding consists of good feeding.
THE LAMBING EWE.
“Yeoman” : Dry pastures and stubbles are
markedly deficient in protein. So if breed-
ing ewes are depastured on herbage and
natural grasses, or on wheaten or other
stubbles, they will not be able to main-
tain their own condition, produce the wool
reasonably expected and fully nourish in
each instance the embryo lamb. But if
such' ewes are fed a daily supplementary
ration of about 2oz. linseed nuts each for
about two or three months prior to lamb-
ing, a good percentage of strong lambs will
be dropped even in the absence of green
feed. A normal flow of milk is assured,
too. It is absence of the natural flow of
milk at the start, when ewes are dependent
upon dry feed only, that is responsible for
_a disappointing lambing.
PINK-EYE IN SHEEP.
“Kooroora”: Pink-eye in sheep is rather
prevalent these times. It is caused by
pollen and dust from wilted herbage, and
can be carried through the flock by means
of flies. It w T ill usually work itself out
in time, but as the blinded sheep are often
unable to find feed and water it is advisable
to give treatment when possible. All affected
sheep should be isolated, and the eyes
bathed in a solution of one teaspoon of
boracic acid to half a pint of water. A solu-
tion of 16 grains of zinc sulphate, 20 grains of
boracic acid and four fluid ounces of boiled
or distilled water may be dropped in the
eyes several times a day. After apparent
recovery, sheep should not be returned to
the main flock for a fortnight.
COUNTRY KILLING.
“C.C.”: Rural workers unemployed are
increasing in numbers, and a solution of their
difficulties is imperative.
The brightest outlook is in connection with
the development of country killing and the
export meat trade. In Maoriland the rural
workers —shearers, woolhands, farmhands
and others —have a period of profitable em-
ployment every year in the meat export in-
dustry, and the result is that the M.L. rural
worker is perhaps the most prosperous in
the world. The export meat trade of that
country shows the following figures, indicat-
ing great and steady progress :
Exports op M.L. Frozen Meat — Carcases.
1909-10. 1929-30.
Mutton 1,844,192 2,041,552
Lamb - 2,302,929 6,414,043
Total 4,147,121 8,455,595
Exports of N.S.W. Frozen Meat —Carcases.

Lamb 408,017 660,014
Total . . .. '.. 1,775,136 1,097,758
Nothing further need be said about the utter
futility of the Homebush abattoirs as a
developmental plant; it must be quite evi-
dent that, although Sydney may be satisfied
with these abattoirs as a place for the meat
business of the city, it is useless for the
State of N. S. Wales to rely upon a plant
which has so obviously hindered and ham-
pered the export trade.
PROTECTING THE HAYSTACK.
“Mulyan”: To keep mice out of their hay-
stacks some of the growers on the Darling
Downs (Q.) make a floor of rough slabs,
about ISin. from the ground, and supported by
hardwood blocks, about a foot in diameter,
stood in kerosene-tins. The bottoms of the
tins are tarred inside and out to keep them
trom rusting. After each load has been
added to the stack, all loose straws are
forked from the sides and the ground, so
that no possible “ladder” will be left for
the rodents to climb up on. A piece of tin
tacked round the blocks answers the same
purpose. If an iron roof is put over the
stack, the posts necessary to carry it should
be similarly covered at the bottom. No mice
can get into the hay when this is done. It
is a neater and cheaper job than putting
sheets of galvanised-iron round the stack, and
the stack is easier to get at from all sides.
It also lasts longer, for when sheets of iron
are used the part that has to be sunk in the
ground soon rots.
A shed built in the same way makes a
secure storehouse for grain, or for anything
else that has to be kept away from mice.
MAKE FARMING A BUSINESS!
“J.H.W.” : The farmer who gets the biggest
return ultimately is the one who farms in a
business way. One of our most successful
fruitgrowers used to be a city accountant.
He had a “chest” and was ordered to the
higher altitudes. He came to the district
I was in, bought a five-year-old orchard and
applied his business training to his new work.
In two years his was the show place of the
district. In five years he was making a
cool thousand pounds a year off ten acres.
One pound a tree net —it may seem incred-
ible, but I saw the figures.
Ilis methods were simple enough. He
ploughed at the proper time and pruned care-
fully, with an eye to the yield two years
ahead —not just next year’s. He cultivated
regularly, drained and fertilised. His neigh-
bors very rarely saw him picking fruit. He
started at dawn and knocked off as soon as
the sun warmed up; the fruit had no time to
get hot. His packing-shed had a shingle
lining under the iron roof. His fruit was
perfectly graded, not one blemished speci-
men going in a case. His cases were care-
fully and securely nailed.
He was always first at the railway siding.
He always loaded his own stuff and chose a
particular corner of the louvred van, remem-
bering that the fruit had a long trip in the
hot sun. The spot he selected w r as on the
shady side and in the front corner where
the air would flow through' the louvre. He
kept a reliable record of the production of
each tree. If one did not respond to treat-
ment after two seasons, or if it was of a
variety which had not proved profitable, he
lopped the limbs off and grafted. He real-
ised that it was a waste of time and money
giving a non-profitable specimen ground
space. It’s sound business to cut the loss.
This man, who made fruit-farming his busi-
ness, had his regular yearly holiday. He
and his two girls worked hard during the
season; then he packed up and went off for
his spell, returning in time for winter plough-
ing and pruning. His methods can be
applied to all farming and can be summed
up. Do it at the proper time. Look after
your machinery; clean it every time you use
it, before putting it away leave it in
the / paddock overnight without a cover.
Watch your crops or flocks and look for the
reason for any backwardness. Take care of
the little leakages. Handle your produce
carefully. Grade it, market it methodically
—in short, apply business principles to the
greatest business of the country.
GOOD NEWS FOR BERRY-GROWERS.
Nowhere in the world are better straw-
berries, raspberries, loganberries and the like
grown than in Tasmania and parts of the
mainland, but hitherto the industry has been
poorly rewarded. The season for berry fruits
is very short; unlike other fruits they can-
not be cool-stored; and so gluts are frequent
and disheartening experiences. A simple and
effective method of storing berries for all-
round-the-year sale would make a world of
difference, and according to G. B. Tindale,
cool-storage research officer in the Yic. Agri-
cultural Department, the Americans have
found one.
As Mr. Tindale describes the process in
the departmental “Journal,” a layer of sound
berries is placed in the bottom of a barrel.
This is covered by a layer of sugar, fib. to
lib. of sugar to lib. of berries. Alternate
layers of berries and sugar are added until
the barrel is filled. The barrels are then
stored at a temperature of 25deg. F., which
is above the freezing-point of the mixture.
The sugar added is already cooled to the
freezing-point; otherwise fermentation would
set up before the temperature of the mass
could be reduced sufficiently. The sugar
is gradually dissolved into the juice which
exudes from the berries, and the whole con-
tents become a uniform mass of fruit pulp,
which has all the properties of fresh fruit.
Companies in the U.S.A. buy the growers’
crops and treat them; the pulp is then dis-
posed of throughout the year, there being
no falling-off in either flavor or aroma. The
largest sales are made to restaurants and
cool-drink shops, although a considerable
trade is done with householders intent on
making pies and tarts or serving berries
with cream, small quantities being delivered
as milk is delivered now. From the pulp
delicious drinks are quickly made.
Mr. Tindale suggests a growers’ organisa-
tion to store and distribute the fruit. Mean-
time further particulars of the process will
be readily supplied to persons Avho may be
interested —the department’s offices are in.
Treasury Buildings, Melbourne.
WHAT OF BANANAS?
“Azac”: It needs only a casual inspec-
tion of the rehabilitated N.S.W. banana
lands to be convinced that the industry has
come to stay this time. Everywhere is notice-
able a keenness to combat bunchy-top and
beetle-borer —the grower’s two worst enemies
—except, perhaps, slipshod marketing
methods. While bunchy-top is a rarity at
the present time, growers would be unwise
to relax their vigilance, for it may be that
the peculiar set of conditions which favored
its widespread depredations some years back
have not since been experienced.
Apart from a keenness in regard to planta-
tion “sanitation,” banana-growers of to-day
are no further advanced than growers of
fruits were 20 years ago. They have given
no attention whatever to plant-selection,
although it is being demonstrated every day
in their plantations that some stools are
yielding perhaps twice as much fruit as
other near-by stools. “Like begets like” will
be found just as applicable to bananas as
to apples, wheat, milch cows, human beings
and racehorses, and an acre of bananas pro-
pagated from high-yielding stools will give
as good returns as from perhaps two acres
of nondescript plants.
The question of varieties has also been
neglected. Cavendish is the only one known
on the North Coast, but even a hasty inspec-
tion of the plantations would be sufficient to
convince one that there is more than one
strain of Cavendish. Apart from distinctly
different bunching habits, even the most un-
observant grower has remarked on the dif-
ferent coloring of the stems of some of the
Cavendish stools. As regards other varieties
the Gros Michel (the Fiji banana of com-
merce) would do well on the Tweed River
in the more sheltered spots. The large fruit
of this variety would command enhanced
prices now that the market is so well sup-
plied with the smaller Cavendish. I re-
cently saw some of the Gros Michel variety
doing well in the Currumbin Valley (Q.).
Lacatan is a variety unknown in this coun-
try. In some respects, particularly as re-
gards sweetness, it is superior to both Caven-
dish and Gros Michel.
Other points to which the grower could
w T ell afford to give attention are manuring
and marketing. The Queensland Depart-
ment has given a lead in the matter of fer-
tilising, but nothing has been done by the
N.S.W. authorities. A Queensland recom-
mendation which should be applicable to
N.S.W. soils is a mixture of 2owt. sodium
nitrate, super, and 2cwt. potassium
sulphate per acre, half being applied at the
end of the summer rainy season and the
remainder at the end of winter. On salt-
deficient soils, muriate of potash should be
used instead of sulphate.
Marketing has been neglected, and the
result of this neglect are already being re-
flected in a 33 per cent, reduction in returns
since production has increased so consider-
ably in the last year. The Banana-growers'
Association should have its own selling floor
and ripening rooms in Sydney, and then go
out after new markets by establishing central
distributing depots in many of the principal
N.S.W. towns. Maoriland also offers a
market for at least 90,000 cases annually,
it being estimated that supplies to Auckland
alone last year were that much short of
requirements. Maoriland at present gets all
her bananas from Fiji, but pests and dis-
eases, favored by slipshod cultural methods,
have reduced the area under bananas in
Fiji to half what it was some few years
back.
AUTUMN-HATCHED CHICKS.
“Jack Point”: The practice of hatching
some chicks during the autumn has more
to commend it this year than ever before,
because of the very low price of wheat and
other cereals suitable for bringing table
birds to the best killing age economically.
The pullets of autumn-hatched chicks will
begin laying in spring and will moult in
the following autumn; therefore, their first
year won’t be as profitable as that of spring-
hatched pullets. Against this, however, they

will come quickly through their first moult
and lay better-sized eggs than the younger
spring pullets, and they will also be avail-
able as good-type breeders when about IS
months old. The cockerels among autumn-
hatched batches of chicks are worthy of
much more considerate treatment than
usually befall their sex.
Confine your autumn hatchings to a dual-
purpose bird like the Rhode Island Red,
Wyandotte or Orpington, the male birds of
which will realise much better prices than
those of light breeds. Provided hatching is
done early enough to enable the critical
period to be passed before really cold
weather sets in, the chicks will be found
quite easy to rear. Separate the sexes as
soon as distinguishable, and proceed with
the pullets in the usual way. The cockerels
should be confined in small but comfortable
quarters and gradually weaned on to a
ration of grain only, varied according to
prices of wheat, maize, barley and the
rest. If oats are cheap, include a liberal
allowance of sprouted ones in the ration.
A couple of old roosters among the cockerels
will check their fighting proclivities.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
What are the merits and demerits of
kileuyu grass in relation to stocking, feeding
and other qualities compared with paspalum
or Rhodes grass? —l362.
Kikuyu grass is useful where it is neces-
sary that some form of succulent food should
be provided during the off season. Its feed-
ing qualities as disclosed by analyses by the
Q’land Agriculture Department set out that
it is somewhat low in proteins, and for this
reason is under certain conditions slightly
less valuable than Rhodes grass when treated
systematically. The opinion is formed that
Kikuyu grass in conjunction with other pas-
tures' is likely to give a far better result
than when fed entirely on its own. It is
naturally a prolific grower, and, althougli
it has not so far seeded in Australia, is
easily propagated, but should not be planted
in ciose proximity to land which is under
cultivation.
A weed which is growing wild on my
Tumut ( N.S.W .) property runs closely
along the ground, as much as Sft. from the
main stem. It hears small yellow flowers
about %in. diameter with five petals, and
has a hard fruit divided into five sections,
each of which has a hard and sharp spine.
(1) What is the name, of this pest? (2)
Is it poisonous? (3) How can it he eradi-
cated? —1441. .
(1) Caltrops ( Trihulus terrestns), a
native of N.S.W. (2) The N.S.W. Dept, of
Agriculture has no direct evidence of it being
poisonous, but it can lame all classes of
animals, and is especially severe on horses;
(3) Where it is thick it should be burnt off
when dry enough. The fire will destroy
large numbers of the burrs and prevent them
seeding.
Where can I obtain Jerusalem corn? —
1459.
Sydney seedsmen report that Jerusalem
corn has gone quite out of cultivation. They
catalogued it many years ago, but there was
little or no demand for it, and its place has
been taken by sorghum.
How can I poison mimosa bushes (com-
monly called prickly bushes) which grow
along Western Queensland bore drains? I
have tried arsenic pentoxide and Roberts’s
pear poison unsuccessfully? —l32B.
Pentoxide will poison any vegetable. You
didn’t apply it at the right time and in the
right way. Use a solution of at least 20 p.c.
to 25 p.c. strength, and chop the bushes
close to the soil, preferably with a frill
cutting, and poison the frill, spraying on the
cut. Larger trees are best treated by the
system of frill ringbarking, followed by the
application of poison in this strength as soon
after as' possible. The proper period for
poisoning corresponds with the season m
which the sap is at rest. In Queensland
this period is in June and July, and might
possibly extend to August.
I killed an old cow to-day. On opening her
I found the paunch alive with little grub-
like creatures, about \in. long, white in color
except at both ends, which were a bright
pink. What are they? —l479.
The parasites in all probability belong to
the family known as Par amp his t o midce. They
are frequently found in the rumen of cattle,
and are of little or no inconvenience to the
animals.
(1) What books would be useful to a
breeder of shorthorns? Price and where
obtainable? (2) Name of a book on Men-
delism which a stud-stock breeder could read
and understand? Price and where obtain-
able?-—1504.
(1) Gay’s “Breeds of Livestock”
(Dymock’s, Sydney; 12s. 6d.) ; “Cattle
Breeding,” edited by Finlay (Angus and
Robertson, Sydney 195.). (2) Crew’s
“Animal Genetics” deals fairly extensively
with Mendelism. Angus and Robertson, 235.
Postage extra in all cases.
(1) Where could I get a list of islands off
the Queensland coast where a man might do
a bit of farming? (2) Under what terms
are such islands leased? —1453.
(1) Write Dept. Lands, Brisbane, for a
list and plan. (2) An occupation license;
annual tenancy, renewable, though it may he
terminated at any time by three months’
notice given by the Minister.
Would £6OO be enough to enable me to
commence fruit-growing in tropical Q’land?
—l2lO.
You would be severely handicapped. You
must be prepared, on new land, to maintain
yourself for the first 18 months, besides pur-
chasing implements, clearing land, providing
quarters and fencing. You might be able to
buy a place on terms on a deposit of £2OO
or £3OO, but as a rule farms which are
for sale for small amounts have little to
recommend them. About £lOOO would be
necessary to give you a fair start.
Proper strength of lime-and-sulphur spray
for citrus trees affected by Maori scale? —
1341
One in 40 is usually effective, but dusting
with sulphur can be done more rapidly and
at less cost than spraying, and is equally
effective.
(1) When is the best time to spray for
white wax on orange-trees? (2) Best spray
mixture, and how to use it? —1393.
(1) From about the beginning of January
onwards. (2) Dissolve of washing soda
in 4 gallons of water and spray the solution
over the scale. Spray at a time when the
scale is in its early stages of development —
not larger than the head of a match.
I have an acre of strawberries in a very
neglected condition, and almost overgrown
with weeds. (1) What’s the best thing to
do with such a patch? Can the old plants be
transplanted, or should I get young ones?
(2) llow long does it take raspberry canes
to come into bearing?— l27l.
(1) If the strawberry plants are three
years old or more it would not be worth
while trying to clean them up. If not over
two years old and not too much weakened,
it should be worth while cleaning up
the bed and manuring it with blood
and bone, and, in the spring, with
sulphate of ammonia. If you decide to plant
a new bed, it would be advisable to use new,
young plants. The ground should be well
worked up and heavily manured with farm-
yard manure, or, if farmyard manure is not
available, with blood and bone. If this were
done now the manure wuuld have time to rot
before planting in May. The ground should
be kept clear of weeds while waiting for
planting. (2) In the second year after
planting some crop can be expected.
How to control black peach aphis? —l472.
Trees subject to black aphis attack should
be closely watched in the spring and sprayed
immediately the aphides appear with nicotine
sulphate (40 p.c.) diluted one part to 800
parts of water by volume (1 pint to 100
gallons water), or tobacco wash, using midrib
factory refuse at the rate of lib. to 2-| gal-
lons of water (see leaflet issued free •by
N.S.W. Agriculture Department on making
tobacco wash). The aphides breed very
rapidly, and it is important to spray before
they have multiplied to great numbers. If
they have appeared before the trees have
commenced to blossom, an endeavor should
be made to get them under control before
the blossoms open, because when the blossoms
open they hide within and are difficult to
reach with the spray. Moreover, heavy
spraying during blossoming may affect the
setting of fruit, though, if necessary, the risk
must be taken. If the aphis is present on
the trees during the dormant period it should
be sprayed with nicotine or miscible oil.
The former can be used the same strength
as for spring or summer use, and may be
combined With the lime-sulphur or Bordeaux
mixture applied for leaf curl. If miscible
oil is used it should be applied after the
application of lime-sulphur or Bordeaux mix-
ture for leaf curl. In spraying a high pres-'
sure is necessary, and the nozzle should be
held close to the. affected parts. If any live
aphis can still be found on the trees two
days after spraying, a second application
should be made at once. Three or four appli-
cations in >quick succession are often neces-
sary.
Can white ants eat through concrete? —
1047.
In a case recorded by the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research they made
their way through a concrete floor of poor
quality. It is recommended in this nublica-
tion that care should be taken to prevent the
construction of covered ways over the con-
crete bed ; that ‘the concrete should be of
good quality, and that none of the studs or
verandah-posts should pass through the con-
crete to the soil below.
HINTS FOR TITE FARM.
“Y.”: If a lamb which lost its dam at
birth is being reared on the bottle, warm
cow’s milk should be fed. For the first
few days a teaspoon of sugar and the white
of an egg should be added to the cow’s milk.
“Wilt”: A bit of money might be made
by growing Brussels sprouts for the Sydney
market; the demand for this vegetable is
brisk. Establish and cultivate the crop as
you would cabbages in the early stages. Soil
should be rich in organic manure, super.
(2cwt. to 3ewt. per acre) should be added at
planting time, and topdressings of sulphate of
ammonia applied when plants have become
established, and when sprouts commence to
form. When the lower leaves commence to
turn yellow, they should be picked off, and
so should the sprouts as they ripen—more
will continue to form throughout the life
of the plant. As sprouts cannot be dusted
with arsenic, the most rigid precautions
against insect pests must be taken.
“M.W.8.” r If your shelter trees are not
thriving try ploughing several furrows each
side of them. This conserves the moisture
and helps to give the young trees a good
start.
“Gwalior”; One sees thousands of pep-
perinas scattered round the farms here in
Queensland. Why don’t the farmers combine
ornament, use and profit by going in for
the Queensland nut? It is a fine shade tree,
it makes a particularly good windbreak and
it will grow almost anywhere. It
thrives in N.S.W. as well as Queensland, and
should do remarkably well in S. Aus. and
Westralian and throughout Gippsland. The
Queensland nut has a market ready-made.
These trees can be bought as cheaply as
pepperinas, they last longer and are disease-
proof. Any firm of nurserymen can supply
pot-grown trees that will travel anywhere,
at 18s. to 20s. a dozen.
“Bill R.”: Where a fence must cross a
flat or slope subject to violent rushes of flood
waters, try building a collapsible barrier.
In the stretch of the wmterway erect Oft.
posts placed 2|ft. in the ground and spaced
33ft. apart. Bring stout droppers imme-
diately beside each post, and between them
have two droppers regularly spaced. Bore
4in. from the bottom, and at intervals up-
ward of 6in., 6in., 7in., Bin. and llin. Make
the whole section entirely a dropper fence
with the bottom wire only passing through
the posts. Reeve upper wires through drop-
pers separately, and key the top wire firmly
thereto with tie-wire. Attach tops of drop-
pers that come alongside posts with wire
lightly twisted. When flood waters press
against it the whole structure, posts ex-
cepted, goes down flat. After the flood has
subsided clear away the debris, stand drop-
pers upright again, and attach them to posts
as before.

Information Sought.
(1) What is the open season for kangaroo
shooting in Queensland? (2) Best part to
shoot in? (3) Is there an open ’possum
season in Queensland?, —1229.
(1) The kangaroo is not protected in any
portion of Queensland. (2) The centrai-
western districts, the southern Darling
Downs, and the south-western portions of
the State. (3) An open season can only be
proclaimed by Order-in-Council. At present
the ’possum is protected.
(1) Is it possible to estimate the amount
of money that leaves Australia every year
as dividends to absentee shareholders? (2)
What effect has this on our present condi-
tion?—97s.
(1) It was estimated that for the year
ended June, 1926, £5,000,000 in interest and
dividends was paid by companies operating
in Australia to absentee shareholders. An
additional £2,000,000 was received by absen-
tees from investments of all kinds and from
property owned in Australia. The chief item
was income from land. In 1929-30 the income
received by absentees from Australia would
be much less than for previous years due
to the fall in values of Australian products.
(2) The amount involved is small in com-
parison with Australia’s obligations.
A list of the more important flights car-
ried out by the Southern Gross when it was
piloted by Kings ford Smith? —l247.
June, 1928: Trans-Pacific flight—San
Francisco to Sydney, via Honolulu and
Suva (Fiji), 6848 miles; flying time 83
hours. Aug., 1928: Transcontinental non-
stop flight—Melbourne to Perth; flying time
234 hours. Sept.. 1928 : Trans-Tasman flight
—Richmond (N.S.W.) to Christchurch
(M.L.), 1400 miles; flying time 14 hours
.12 minutes; the return flight from Blen-
heim (M.L.) to Richmond (N.S.W.) was
accomplished in 23 hours. June, 1929:
Sydney to London, 10,500 miles; flying time
12 days 14 hours 18 minutes. June, 1930:
Transatlantic flight—lreland to Newfound-
land, 1900 miles; flying time 31 hours
23 minutes.
Bells on my neighbor’s cows keep me
awalce at night. What can I do about it?
—I44S.
Those who go on the land usually adapt
themselves to such discomforts. You would
have to proceed by the costly way of injunc-
tion if you wished to compel your neighbor
to dock his cows of bells, and your chances
of success would be remote. Talk it over
with him in a friendly way.
(1) Essential equipment for a prospector
for alluvial gold in shallow ground, and
whe>'e obtainable ? (2) Description of a
rough-and-ready sluicing-box? (3) Quantity
of wash that can be handled by two men in
a dayf —l36o.
(1) Equipment should consist of pros-
pector’s shovel, Ballarat driving pick and
handle, prospecting dish or pan (15in. in
diameter) and a gold-washing cradle. These,
with the exception of a cradle, should not
involve an outlay of more than £l. Personal
equipment is a matter for individual tastes
or financial circumstances, but some pro-
vision for sleeping and cooking must cer-
tainly be made. This equipment, except the
cradle, can be purchased at most country
stores in gold-mining districts, or from Syd-
ney merchants. (2) Sluices are made up of
a series of troughs formed by planks nailed
together and may be about 10ft. in length,
Sin. to 2ft. in height, and Ift. to 4ft. in
width. Across the inside of the bottom planks
strips of wood about 2in. thick and Sin.
wide are fixed at short intervals. The
troughs have a slight gradient, so that run-
ning water washes downwards the earth
thrown into the top of the sluice. The fine
gold falling out of the current accumulates in
front of the bars, while the lighter materials
are washed away at the lower end. Do not
allow too much material to accumulate
behind the cross strips, or gold, will be lost.
(3) Two men should supply five cubic yards
per eight-hour day.
I intend to manufacture and market l a
compound for destroying certain pests. Can
1 adopt a formula used by other manufac-
turers, or must I get a chemist to work out
a new one?. —1361. _ ,
Risky to use another maker’s recipe with-
out permission. It might be patented. State
your requirements to an analyst or manu-
facturing chemist and act upon his advice.
(1) What were the total imports of U.S.A.
origin for the year ending June 30, 1930,
and ivhat were the more important items of
import? (2) Total Australian exports to
U.S.A. for some period? —l2l4.
(1) £30,316,208. Principal items: Motor-
cars, etc., £5*338,152; tobacco, etc.,
£1,870,480; apparel textiles and manufac-
tured fibres, £2,093,022; oils in bulk,
£6.063,935; machines and machinery,
£4,990,284 ; timber, etc., £2,227,696 ; sulphur,
£552,946. (2) £5,233,772. Principal items:
Hides and skins, £1,658,986; wool,
£1,154,433; gold specie, £1,000,000; pearl-
shell, £361,666; sausage casings, £357,547.
(1) Is it possible to catch crayfish on the
N.S.W. coast? (2) Should traps be set near
the shore, or out in deep water? (3) Do
crayfish travel away from our shores in the
summer season? If not, what happens to
them? (4) Any books dealing with this
subject? —ll69.
(1) Crayfish are prevalent on the whole
of the New South Wales coast, as far north
as the Clarence River, from August until the
following March. (2) Generally only a
small run are caught close to the shore, a
larger run being caught in the deeper water.
(3) It is only during the period specified
that crayfish are present on the coast: where
they migrate during the intervening months
(April to July) is not known. (4) Don’t
know of any;
N.S.W. assessment notices on income in
respect of unemployment relief tax arc now
being received, based on income for the 12
months to June 30, 1930. (1) Can a rebate
be obtained if it can be proved that the
amount of income has since fallen off? (2)
Will the Taxation Commissioners consider a
request for payment by instalments? —1252.
(1) No. (2) An application for an exten-
sion of time or to pay by instalments will
receive consideration.
Around Sydney are many beautiful flower-
ing gums. (2) Can they be grown from
seed? (2) Best-known species and height?
(3) Soil required and situation? —1599.
(1) They can be grown from seed, but it
is a very slow process. It is preferable to
purchase established shrubs from nursery-
men. The price is 2s. 6d. each. (2) The
most notable are Ficifolia (scarlet), 20ft.;
Preissiana (deep lemon), 15ft.; Calophylla
rosea (pink), 30ft.; Erythonema (crimson),
Bft., which will flower within two years of
planting; and MacrocUrpa (large crimson
flowers), 12ft. (3) Gums are not particular
as to soil, and are easy to cultivate. They
do best in dry areas and under warm con-
ditions ; but are not recommended for very
cold districts. Do not add organic or arti-
ficial manures to the soil.
To-day (27/l/’3l) in Melbourne heavy
clouds obscured the sun all day. At about
9 p.m. 1 noticed the heavy cloud mass clear-
ing away right across the sky in an almost
straight line. Soon the sky was absolutely
cloudless. Is this unusual? ,The clouds
moved from east to west, which seems
strange, as storms usually move from ivest
to east. —1467.
The rapid phenomenon was noted by the
officer on duty at the Meteorological Bureau,
Melbourne. It is rather unusual, but has
been observed before under a similar dis-
tribution of pressure. For a day or two
previously an area of high pressure had been
drifting eastwards from the Bight and the
cool southerly winds in its front had caused
the formation of clouds over southern coastal
districts. As the “high” became centred over
Tasmania during the afternoon, the winds
veered easterly in the normal sequence, with
consequently warmer temperatures in the air
above Melbourne, arradually sweeping away
the clouds in its front.
How many cubic feet are there in a ton of
broken and a ton of unbroken quarts? —
879.
Thirteen and a half cubic feet to the ton
for quartz unbroken (in place) and 23
cubic feet to the ton for quartz broken (as
ore) may be taken as an average. The
class of quartz, mineral contents, etc., affect
the question somewhat.
(1) What are the qualifications of a ship’s
purser? (2) Could one graduate to this posi-
tion from ship’s steward? —1483.
(1) A good secondary-school education,
and experience as a member of the shore
staff of the line. (2) No.
What is the procedure and cost in N. S.
Wales if one desires to change one’s name?
—1574.
Execute a deed poll drawn up by a soli-
citor and file it in the Registrar-General’s
Department, Queen’s-square, Sydney. The
fee for filing is 2s.
(1) Studying a unique British machine to
be seen in Sydney, I discovered a way of
applying its principle for entirely different
purposes. Could I patent the idea? Slight
structural modifications are required? (2)
In the event of my claiming protection,
could the original patentee use the machine
for purposes I put it to? —1358.
(1) It depends on what amount of in-
vention (not merely adaptation) is entailed
in rendering the machine suitable for your
purpose. Speaking generally, slight struc-
tural modifications do not constitute patent-
able differences. Put the whole facts before
a patent attorney, giving number and date
of British patent, and ask him to ascertain
if a corresponding Australian patent has
been issued. (2) A patent granted to you
would operate against the patentee of the
original machine, as well as against others.
(1) Is it possible to make a 3in. object
glass or reflecting mirror for a refracting
or reflecting astronomical telescope, and is
there any book on the subject? (2) Pre-
sent duty, if any, on imported astronomical
telescopes. —l 344.
(1) An amateur can grind a mirror for
a reflecting telescope; about 6in. or Sin. is
the usual size. Materials required are two
thick plate-glass discs, not less than lin.
thick, costing about 15s. each; grinding and
polishing powders, chemicals for silvering
and plenty of patience. Grinding an objec-
tive for refracting telescope is not recom-
mended. A good description for working
is contained in a book by Ellison, “The
Amateur Telescope,” but this may be hard to
get. It was published in serial form in the
“English Mechanic” 12 or 14 years ago. (2)
British telescopes are duty free, except for
primage and sales tax; foreign are dutiable
at 20 p.c., plus primage and sales tax.
Why is it that the rising sun is a lot larger
than at noon and the full moon than at mid-
night?—l3ss.
It really isn’t so. The large size of the
sun and moon at rising and setting is an
optical illusion, probably brought about by
the fact that in their positions then on the
horizon their size is compared to terrestrial
objects. If the full moon is looked at
through a tube in order to cut out surround-
ing objects it will be seen to be of normal
size.
(1) Is there any other system in use or
patented whereby control and discharge of a
given quantity of water are governed by
depressing a lever, as in the ordinary lava-
tory cistern? (2) Commercial possibilities
of a cistern worked by a different system —
less noisy and leak-proof, yet cheap and
effective. (3) With some modern cisterns
there is a button insead of a chain. Are
these cisterns on the same principle as the
older type? —l2o3.
(1) All silent flushing-valve systems
worked in conjunction with' a storage tank
operate as you describe. (2) Great, if you
can make one permanently leak-proof. (3)
The principle governing the working is prac-
tically the same.
(1) My wife intends going to England
for two years. How long could she stay
there without paying income tax? (2) On
an income of £lOO per month what tax would
she have to pay? (3) Any allowances made
for income tax paid in Australia? (4) If
she took a furnished flat in London, would
that constitute residence. (5) If she stayed
in England for six months, went abroad for
a few weeks and then returned, would that
help her? —1343.
(1) Up to six months. (2) The standard
rate of income tax in the U.K. is 4s. per £
of the taxable income; the first £225 is
chargeable at half standard rate of tax, the
remainder at standard rate. There is a
“personal allowance” of £l35 —apparently
the only one that would be due in the case
mentioned. If so, the taxable income would
be £1065 p.a., of which £225 would be
chargeable at 2s. in the £, and the remainder
at 4s. (3) Relief is granted under certain
conditions in the case of a taxpayer who- has
paid, or is liable to pay, U.K. income tax
on any part of his income and who proves
that he has paid Dominion tax for the same
year in respect of the same part of his
income. (4) Yes. (5) Not if the Income
Tax Commissioners could prove legal resi-
dence in the U.K.
(1) Can a mainlander lease or obtain free-
hold land on Lord Howe Island? (2) Can

NORTH TERRACE, ADELAIDE
OPPOSITE RAILWAY STATION
NO ESCAPE
By Velia Ercole
Synopsis : The story opens in 1905
in the small town of Banton, N. 8.
Wales, west of the Blue Mountains,
where Dr. Gherardi, an Italian poli-
tical exile, has settled with his wife
and son, and is establishing a practice.
As yet he does not understand the
people very well, and his difficulties
are increased by the local matron, a
good, woman but incompetent, and by
the fretfulness of his wife, who accom-
panied him to Banton against his
wish, but who now, he feels, is making
no effort to adapt herself to his cir-
cumstances. She bitterly resents his
having lost, in gold-mine speculation,
the money that might have taken them
back to Italy, but when he offers to
send her back and support her there
she will not hear of it. Dr. Gherardi
takes consolation from the thought
that he will not stay in Banton vetry
long, and his wife tries to accustom
herself to the situation by meeting the
local social leaders. She creates a
sensation among them on her first visit
—a tennis-and-tea meeting—by admit-
ting that she doesn't keep any ser-
vants. There is another scene between
Dr.' Gherardi and his wife following
a visit from a successful old German
settler, _ Schultz, who wants Dr.
Gherardi to invest in land. After this
scene Mrs. Gherardi’s hysterical out-
bursts become rarer, but she tends
towards melancholy, and further wor-
ries her husband when, returned from
a walk, she tells him she has been to
the ugly Banton cemetery.
Chapter IY ( Continued ).
WELL, it does not matter much to
them !” said Leo in a sprightly voice
to hide the fact that he was dis-
turbed. “They will be comfortable with the
dust, and have no longer eyes to see beauty.
For myself,” he added argumentatively, “I
prefer the cremating.”
“No, it does not matter,” Teresa agreed.
“They do not worry. I saw the grave of the
wife of that German, Schultz. Gretel
Schultz. She lies between the graves of a
man called Patrick O’Leary and a child
named Dodd. If she could feel, she must
feel sad to spend eternity between
strangers.” She laughed k gratingly, then
added with a touch of hysteria: “But she
cannot feel, my Leo!”
She had leaned one arm on the shelf of
the bookcase and was staring, unseeing, at
the wall.
Watching her drooping figure, which had
grown very still, he found himself revolving
her last words, “She cannot feel.”
With an effort he roused himself. A
crushing weight of despondency had settled
on his spirit, pinioning it.
“We can feel, can’t we, Teresa? The
trouble is we feel too much. You are very
unhappy these days, aren’t you?” He was
fumbling after comfort. But she did not
answer him, and then the sickening little
fear which he knew to have been bom at
her words took on life and vigor. She was
an emotional girl. Her melancholy was
becoming abnormal. God knew what she
might do! The thought of her, of him,
caught and merged, gave him as nothing
else had done a realisation of the inad-
equacy of his present existence. These
trivialities with which he contrived to fill
his days—what were they? That afternoon
he had been at the inaugural meeting of a
new club. He had been asked whether he
could shoot. He could shoot. He had been
brought along to the meeting held in a
room at the Council Chambers, a dusty little
room with broken chairs piled in one corner
and a heap of bunting piled in another.
And with all the solemnity in the world
they had brought forth the Sparrow Club!
Shooting members, five shillings. Non-
shooting members, two and sixpence.
That was life, per Dio! He had set out
armed for big game, and become a member
of the Sparrow Club!
“Yes, she is better off than I,” said
Teresa slowly. “Both, we are in a grave
surrounded by strangers. But to her it
does not matter now.”
“Come, dear,” said Leo with an attempt
at heartiness, “do you forget you have me
and Dino? And for you the door of escape
opens. For her it is eternally shut.” Then,
dropping all pretence, he spoke more
vehemently: “You seem to forget sometimes
that we are together in this trial. I remem-
ber it always. But for you God knows
what would happen to me. You make my
existence possible, Teresa. You and our
son. For your sake I have patience, and
remain here instead of fleeing hither and
thither, accomplishing nothing. And because
of you I am able to remain here with for-
titude.”
The ring of conviction in his voice roused
Teresa from her apathy. She left the book-
case and came over to him.
“Is that the truth, Leo? Am I still neces-
sary to you? You aren’t contented here, are
you?”
“That is a foolish question to ask.”
Her shoulders drooped. “No, I suppose
I am silly. I get fancies, and I think of
them so long that they become facts for
me.”
“He caught her hand which hung loosely
by her side. “Come,” he said cheerfully,
“I have had letters to-day from Enrico
and Elizabetta. Full of news. Let us read
them together and forget this place for a
time. The months are passing, Teresa. The
years will have passed before we realise,
if you can only have courage. Do not
get it out of your head that I am just as
anxious as you to be gone.”
(2)
But when he awoke in the morning and
found the September sun streaming through
the window-curtains he was curiously con-
tent with the day before him.
A cart with groaning wheels jolted down
the road. The gardener whom he had
engaged to work three mornings a week was
raking over the gravelled paths in the front
of the house. The rasping clink was
pleasant, homely to his ears, the regularity
of the up-and-down movements soothing.
The old man had been at work since dawn,
and Leo caught the scent of freshly-watered
earth, with all its subtle insinuation of clean,
growing things; of grass and straight young
trees reaching to the sun, and running water
and forest carpets of damp leaves. In the
kitchen Teresa was grinding the coffee for
breakfast, and the appetising smell was
wafted through the house. Dino’s shrill
young voice was raised in a questionnaire
as to the habits of a butcher-bird, and the
old gardener disposed of his queries simply
and the raking was not interrupted.
Leo got briskly out of bed. The day’s
work seemed sufficient.
He saw three patients before he went to
the hospital. Only one of them, a farmer
with a broken hand, lingered in his mind.
The man had sat stolidly through the opera-
tion of setting and bandaging the broken
bone. Beads of sweat had gathered on his
forehead and trickled down the side of his
dust-grimed face. But he had made no
sound, watching Leo’s deft movements.
“Right now!” said Leo briskly, and turned
to his desk.
But the man had not moved. “Might
get some rain this week,” he said. His eyes
had wandered to the open doorway.
“Yes,” from Leo, bending over his desk.
“Things is pretty bad out our way,” the
man continued. “I ain’t too badly off,
’ceptin’ for the crops. I ain’t over-stocked
this year, but some’s havin’ a terrible bad
time.”
He waited for comment. None came.
“Well, I’ll be pushin’ along.” He rose
ponderously, holding his hat in his hand.
Leo too rose.
“That might give you some pain,” he
said briskly. “Take this to the chemist..
He will give you some tablets. Take one
or two if the pain gets bad. Understand?”
But now he was recalling the man’s efforts
at conversation. With a sudden exclama-
tion he stood still. “Fool that I am!” he
said aloud, then walked on. Of course the
man had expected a “yarn,” that desultory
trail of words which was as important to the
patients as attention to their ailments. They
didn’t want brisk efficiency. A little interest
would have made a friend of that farmer.
Solicitude for his crops, grave attention re-
garding the pain in his back when he
stooped, and recognition of the importance
of that operation his wife had in Sydney—
time and time again he had quenched the
placid stream of these confidences. He had
been brisk, business like.
“Slow down! Slow down! Why all this
hurry. Can’t you catch the easy rhythm
of this little town?”
A laborer was mending a culvert at the
side of the road. Leisurely he swung his
pick, swing and fall, twice, three times. He
leaned on his pick and fumbled with one
hand for his pipe. A man in a tip-dray
came jogging along.
“Mornin’, Harry,” called the laborer. The
dray drew to a standstill.
He left them in the sunshine and walked
on.
“But what does it matter? You won’t be
here long. Whether these people are friends
or enemies does not affect you But it is
good for business. Besides, you would like
their good opinion?”
Amos Sherry, dour and disgruntled, was
hastening down to open his hay and com
store.
“Good morning,” said Leo affably, coming
to a standstill in front of him.
Amos blinked his small eyes. This new
doctor chap, now what the hell did he
want!
“Mornin’,” he said grumpily.
Haltingly Leo pursued the topic of the
rain, chased it through all the winds which
blew, and when it seemed gone for ever
lugged it scientifically into the realm of
cause and effect. Amos heard him in silence,
and, when the other paused for lack of
breath, grunted, “Yes, that’s so. Well, I
gotter be getting along, Doc., I’m late start-
ing work. Mornin’.”
Leo proceeded on his way with a con-
sciousness of a task well performed; but the
encounter lingered in the mind of Amos like
an irritating fly. At midday when he w T ent
home for dinner he inquired angrily of
Fanny.
“You ain’t been to see that Dago doctor,
have you?”
“No,” said Fanny, who was pale and
drooping and scarcely listened to her hus-
band when he spoke these days.
Amos laughed harshly. “Well, he musta
heard you was expectin’. If he thinks the
w r ay to hum patients is by holdin’ ’em up
in the streets an’ talkin’ about the weather,
he’s wrong. When I want a doctor I kno ,v
where to look for one. I don’t want him
cornin’ lookin’ for me! Nobody don’t get
nothin’ by bein’ patronisin’ with Amos
Sherry.”
Leo, entering the hospital gate, which was
loose on its hinges and creaked painfully as
he pushed it, was animated by his success
with Amos. He visioned himself as a
Friend of the People. He would win the
complete confidence of these men and
women, dominate the town, a serene, omnis-
cient figure, haven of refuge for the sick and
distressed. In his mind’s eye he saw, not
the red-brick, ugly reality confronting him,
but a stretching stone edifice with quiet col-
onnades and cool marble verandahs. There
in that corner where the cows were grazing,
a maternity cottage might be erected. There
were at this moment two cases of blood
poisoning at the hospital. He suspected—
w r hy prevaricate? He knew why that
woman Marks had died of peritonitis. There
must be an isolated building for maternity
cases. But he must not go too fast. He
had harassed the hospital committee suffi-
ciently. They were still trembling under
the shock of having to provide an operating-
table. But by all the gods there was one
matter he would bring up at the next meet-
ing. This hopeless inefficiency of the staff!
He pressed the bell until his finger was
bruised by the pressure. Nobody came.
He opened the wired doors. On one side
of him was the waiting-room, a dark hole
with its horse-hair sofa, three cane-bottomed
chairs, new linoleum and withering palms.
To the left was the room which served
as the out-patients’ department and operat-
ing theatre. Further down the corridor
opened the two wards, men’s and women’s,
and along the top of the T-shaped division
were the three private rooms, which were
used as nurses’ quarters unless in demand
for private patients. If occupied, the nurses
slept where they could, in vacant beds in
the wards, and even, when on rare occa-
sions the hospital was overflowing, on mat-
tresses on the floor of the waiting-room. He
was going to change all this.
“Nurse!” he roared. No one came. He
went into the men’s ward. Three patients,
more or less convalescent, were drowsing
apathetically. At Leo’s appearance their
faces brightened, bodies were heaved higher
on to pillows and salutations were offered.
Only old Ed Minahan ignored the doctor's
presence. He lay on his back, one withered
arm outside the counterpane. The sun
streamed through the window beside his
bed, but its intricate dance failed to make
him open his eyes. Hid lined old face was
grey as the stubble on his chin. The long
process of Ed’s dying was nearly completed.
At the sound of Leo’s feet on the uncov-
ered floor a startled little probationer shot
from the pantry at the end of the ward.
Hastily she affixed her crushed white cap
and dried her hands on her apron. Leo had
his fingers on Ed’s thin wrist.
“Where is matron?” he queried abruptly.
The little probationer was cowed.
“She’s still asleep, Doctor. Nurse McGrath
was at the Masonic Ball and Matron was
on duty last night.”
Leo frowned.
The little probationer quaked. “She said
I was to wake her when you came.”
“Well, I have come! What is the matter
with you, girl. Do you think you see my
spirit? And, Nurse”—as she fled from
the presence—“tell Alf to bring the screen
for this bed.”
The little probationer knew what that
meant. Death pursued her as she fled. Her
round young eyes grew rounder still. Death,
and the doctor going to bite the matron’s
head off! Life was full of possibilities.
Who’d stay on a farm!
“The old chap don’t look too good,
Doctor,” said Rufe Walters, cheerfully in-
terested. “There ain’t been a blink outer
’im all mornin’.”
A flicker of excitement ran round the
ward. Beds creaked, then settled. There
was a hush. It was broken by Alf stag-
gering awkwardly in with the screen. Alf
had no patience with these new-fangled
notions. He reckoned he’d been a wards-
man long enough to know what patients
needed and what they didn’t need. He
unfolded the screen, then stood looking
down at Ed.
“Gonna kick the bucket, I reckon,” he
said dispassionately.
“Will you be quiet!” rasped Leo. “You
may go. I do not need you now.”
Ed was left in peace behind the high
white screen, against which imprisoned sun-
beams flickered fruitlessly in their effort to
escape.
Alf retreated to finish his interrupted
morning tea, and brood darkly on the
hifalutin’ way of fellers as thought they
owned the earth because they had M.D.
after their names with screens and what-
nots, and all the people in the town running
mad to get money for an operating-table.
Old Doc. McGinnis had done as good opera-
tions as this feller ever read of in books,
and done them on that table in there.
The little probationer came running
across to the underground tank on whose
cover he was sitting.
“The doctor says you’re to go and hunt
the cows from the front of the hospital.”
Alf ambled away, swearing bitterly. If
there was much more of this feller he’d
quit, Alf decided.
The matron, hastily dressed and still
heavy with sleep, was making an agonising
effort not to yawn in Leo’s face.
“We cannot go on like this,” he was say-
ing vehemently. “If Nurse McGrath is on
night duty, she spend her night at the

hospital, not at dances. Tell her, Matron,
that it must not occur again, or I must
report to the committee. You are too kind-
hearted.” But the tone of his voice trans-
lated the words accurately. “You are an
incapable, bungling fool,” he meant.
“I know, Doctor, but” began the
woman.
“Result, you are tired, you must sleep.
Nurse McGrath she dance all night. She
is tired, she must sleep. Who is to care for
the patients? That child?”
“Yes, Doctor, I know”——,
“Very well, then. We shall ask the com-
mittee to define clearly the duty of each
member of the staff. Then we know where
we are. We must have some sort of organi-
sation What is that bundle on the
floor?”
“Oh! that must have come this morning.
Probably from the Ladies’ Guild. Their
monthly contribution. It looks a big parcel
this time. They do work well.” For the
first time she felt a positive glow of grati-
tude to the Ladies’ Guild.
But the hoped-for pacification of Leo was
not brought about by the Ladies’ Guild. He
drew down his brow angrily. “More of
that rubbish!” He kicked the bundle and
worried it with his foot until its contents
were strewn about the corridor. Rags of
every description, clean and unclean;
cracked china; rusty spirit-stove; papers,
months old; twisted leather; worn bedding.
“What they imagine we have here!” he
exclaimed tempestuously. “Do they realise
this is a hospital, or do they think we are
dealers in rags and broken bottles? Truly
I am sick of this ignorance. Anything is
good enough for the hospital, they think!
Well, we will teach them that nothing is
good enough for the hospital. They should
be ashamed! Anything no longer fit for
wear or use—oh send it to the hospital!
They will be very glad to have it. Well,
they will learn we are not a rubbish heap.
I tell you what wrap again these things
and return to the ladies. Tell them we
have here, as patients, men and women, not
the dogs! ” As always when excited his
command of English weakened.
The matron stared at him in shocked
silence. “Oh, but Doctor, some of the
most influential ladies of the town are on
the committee. I couldn’t possibly offend
them like that. What will they think!”
“They will think nothing. They have no
brains to think.” Leo was chewing at
his moustache in his wrath.
“But, Doctor,” began the poor woman,
worried out of her sleepiness.
“Well, tell Alf to take and burn!”
Inspiration came to the harried matron.
“Doctor, I’m sure if I were to put it
nicely to the Guild they’d understand. You
know they really mean well. And they’ve
been doing such a lot towards collecting
for the operating-table. We'd never have
raised the money if it hadn’t been for the
ladies’ enthusiasm. Mrs. Cartwright, the
president, has done simply wonders. I hear
she has ten pounds in hand already. It
wouldn’t do to offend them outright. I’ll
use tact.”
“Use what you like, long as this rubbish
stops to come here. I myself am writing
a letter to the committee stating our needs.
It will be ready for next meeting. Now
let us see Mrs. Parker.”
This was an uncomfortable man, with a
vile temper!
Walking down the hill, having performed
his duties with a thoroughness which left
the inadequate staff quite limp, Leo still
burned with the wrath of the zealot. In his
pocket were copious notes for the letter to
the hospital committee.
The town lay sun-hazed beneath him. On
the left of the road was a stretching com-
mon, pockmarked by the old mines; barren,
deserted save for a few straying cows and
goats which sought pasture among the
shaly, thistle-encumbered hillocks. There
were no habitations. The place, gashed and
slit, erupting every few yards into red clay
dumps, many of which still bore the skele-
tons of drills and whims and pumps, was
the inscribed foundation-stone of the town.
Half-way down the hill, on this side of the
road, were a few shanties, slab-walled and
tin-roofed, relics of the early days, occupied
by families whose poverty precluded more
habitable dwellings. But on the opposite
side of the road was a row of modern struc-
tures, built by a landlord who considered
the terrace motif the most melodious in
good architecture and good business. The
insensate folly of this cramping never struck
the good man. The houses were of painted
weatherboard, roofed with corrugated-iron
and like one another as peas in a pod.
A straight path led from the front gates
to the verandah steps. In line with these
were the front doors. On either side of
the path were garden plots; on either side
of the halls were two rooms. At the back
was another verandah, with one end closed
as a wash-house. That was one of the
two main types of architecture in Banton.
The second type differed in that one of
the front rooms was elongated and boasted
what was known as a bow-window. There
was but one house of two storeys, and even
this radical departure was safeguarded from
outraged convention by strict adherence to
ground plan No. 2. The owner, in apology
for thrusting his house skywards and dis-
turbing the flat level of the town, had devi-
ated in no respect from the bow-window
type.
Leo, striding down the hill, halted sud-
denly in front of one of the weatherboard
cottages. He wrinkled his nose in disgust.
He walked a few paces to the left, then
to the right, then with determination un-
latched the gate and walked up the path.
A woman, redfaced from bending over a
stove, answered his knock. She smiled
cheerfully in greeting.
“Mrs. Nicholls,” said Leo without any
preamble to the woman, who was one of his
patients, “tell me what is that I smell from
the road?”
The woman looked at him vacantly.
“Smell?” she queried. “I dunno, ’less it
might be the dinner cooking.” Again she
smiled broadly.
“No, I do not think you eat the thing I
smell!” said Leo decisively. “It is like
decayed matter.”
“Oh, I know what you mean!” said the
woman. “It’s the garbage. It smells awful
when the wind catches it. You musta got a
whiff. I’m gettin’ used to it meself.”
“But surely,”- broke in Leo desperately,
“you do not let it remain in the yard?”
“O Lord, no! Old Pete Sims generally
carts it away for his pigs. But he’s been laid
up this last couple of weeks and we’ve
just had to let it lie. We’re all complainin’.
Pete generally takes all the scraps from the
houses down this street. Mrs. Mclntyre
had Jamie get hers into the cart, and take
and dump it down a shaft.”
“Well, we must see about this,” said Leo.
“It is not healthy. I do not want an out-
break of typhoid in the town. There should
be some system of removal. The council
should attend to this.”
For a minute after he had gone the
woman stood in the doorway staring after
him. He was right, she thought indiffer-
ently. Somebody ought to do something
about it. , 1

At the bottom of the hill the road
sprouted five branches, three of which were
not sufficiently fed by dwellings to keep
them alive after a few hundred yards, and
tailed into old mining fields and paddocks.
The road going south continued for thirty
miles, linking Banton with the town of Gun-
dibbie. The fifth branch curved into
Main-street, sprouting casually until it had
made a right-angled turn, then bursting into
the bloom of shops, offices, banks and
hotels.
At the crossroad stood the Empire Hotel,
a paint-blistered octopus stretching out four
dusty arms to grasp the arriving traveller.
It was a sleepy octopus. On this September
morning its only sign of vitality was a
maid shaking rugs over the balcony which
enclosed three sides of the upper storey.
Travellers who desired refined quiet usually
chose the Empire, because, as the town was
convinced, it was out of the bustle and
noise. Less restful-minded had their choice
of five hotels in Main-street, running down
the scale of comfort and respectability to
the Princess, a weatherboard, single-floored
building, a survival of the town’s inception,
and maintaining, so respectable citizens
alleged, the less-favorable characteristics of
those unashamed days when no less than
twenty-five such “pubs” had opened their
doors to an unexacting public.
Leo took the turn into Main-street with-
out even a glance for the hotel or the new
Council Chambers, whose ornamental facade
compensated for the cow-paddock at its
rear. The bakehouse, one of the casual
sprouts near the junction of the branch,
halted him for an instant. The hot, thick
smell of bread hung in the air. Behind
the fly-specked glass window were violent
pink-iced cakes and withered pastry, lure
to the flies which buzzed in ecstasy above
them. Leo snorted: one more drop in the
river of his righteous wrath! He fled
through the dust of Main-street, passed
without seeing the undertaker’s parlors of
Wim and Morrow, with the mortuary
window-dressing of artificial flowers under
glass domes.
A loaded waggon drawn by four tired
horses whose coats were streaked with
muddy rivers of sweat drew up thankfully
outside Austin’s machinery depot. Leo
swerved to avoid the vehicle. But he did
not pause a moment to inspect the jungle
of machinery from which Austin emerged
to greet the passing world.
“Reckon it’ll be bom before he gets
there and he’ll lose his five quid,” Austin
chuckled—he was a wit and a father. “He
oughter get one of these motor-cars.”
Leo halted outside a yellow-painted brick
building, a “block” of shops and offices next
to the Albion Hotel. He entered by a
narrow side-door, excusing himself to a
man who lolled against the wall, obscuring
the smeary brass-plate which announced the
presence of “J. Cartwright, Attorney, Solici-
tor, Proctor and Conveyancer.”
(4)
At Leo’s entrance the lawyer swung
round from his desk. His smile was the
briefest flicker of strong, well-cut lips; his
verbal greeting a surly growl.
“What the devil do you mean coming at
this time of the morning? We don’t all
earn our living writing prescriptions. Some
of us work, you know!”
But this morning Leo had no smile for
the familiar joke. “John, we must do some-
thing about this town!” he burst out. He
had seated himself, and, producing a cigar,
leaned over the desk in search of matches.
“The filth of the garbage will bring the
typhoid epidemic. And how I am to treat,
God knows! A staff of fools who go to
dances and sleep all the day, and a hospital
full of rubbishl”
Cartwright tilted back in his chair and
smiled ironically. “Go on. Let us have it !”
Cartwright was mayor of the town, presi-
dent of the newly-formed Parents and
Citizens’ Association, trustee of the hospi-
tab An Englishman of culture and attain-
ments, he possessed the shrewdness of judg-
ment, the caution and ability to become the
chief figure in a little town, but lacked the
spark of recklessness which could have made
him a figure in the country as well. For
ten years he had been in Banton. It was
likely that he would remain in Banton until
he died.
But the things he might have done
weighed little with John Cartwright. He
was deeply interested in the things he was
doing. Under his leadership Banton had
gathered together its frayed ends and was
slowly becoming a town. For Leo he had
conceived an instant liking, though it was
some time before his reserve betrayed that
liking.
“I am writing a detailed letter of our
needs to the committee. I have here some
notes. These things are essentials. With-
out, we cannot go on. Or we will go on,
but we can give no real service. The hospi-
tal might as well shut down as continue in
this clumsy, antiquated fashion.”
Cartwright perused the notes. The curve
of his lips remained unchanged.
“Well, you can write it. It won’t do any
harm. But it won’t do any good either.
You must go slow with this sort of thing.”
Leo made an irritated gesture.
“See here, Doctor. I know this town. I
know these people. We go slowly. But
we’re certain of ourselves. We know every
inch of the way we’ve travelled, and we
have a pretty good idea of what’s in front
of us. It’s no good trying to rush. Give the
people time. They’re getting you a new
operating-table, aren’t they? What have you
got to growl about? Doc McGinnis was
here for fifteen years, and in all that time
he didn’t get a table. You’ve got it in six
months. That shows that the town is taking
some notice of you. But don’t overdo it.
You’re still a stranger. You’ll always be a
foreigner.”
“Damn it, always? See, I’m not thinking
of myself. I don’t want these things. For
what I care the typhoid can come and they
can all die. As Leo Gherardi, that doesn’t
matter to me. I’ll be gone in a year or
two. But as medical officer of this hospital
I will have things the way they must be!”
“And that’s a lie,” said John dispassion-
ately. “If you honestly meant that, do you
think the town wouldn’t be on to you? You
can’t fool a small town any more than you
can fool kids. In a big city it’s the things a
man does that counts. In a small town, it’s
the man himself. Why, I don’t know.
probably we’ve got time here to find out
what a man’s like. We don’t just transact
our business with him and go away. We let
him into our lives, and we take notice of his.
And we’re not all fooled all the time. Now
you—you’re a good doctor, a damn good
doctor, and if I can keep you in this town
I’m going to. So there you are, and be-
cause of that I’ll see that you get your new
beds and your etceteras—some time. But
the way to get things done here isn’t by
rushing bullheaded. You’re doing very well.
Lqq],”
He took a paper from the side of his desk
and unfolded it He was smiling again, a
slightly satirical smile. He pointed to a
passage from the Banton “Weekly Cham-
pion”:
“The Banton District Hospital has been
fully occupied for a long time past,
accommodation being taxed to the utmost
and the staff fully employed. In view of so
many critical cases and serious operations,
the recoveries speak volumes for the skill
of Dr. Gherardi, the medical officer. We
learn that a remarkable and very clever
operation was performed on Mrs. Ned Rales
day before yesterday. When seen by the
doctor Mrs. Rales was very low. Within
two hours she had been brought to the
hospital, the operation had been success-
fully performed and the patient is now
recovering. We extend our hearty congratu-
lations to both patient and doctor.
Leo flung down the paper furiously,
“Christo!” he said.
Cartwright laughed. “Well, there you are.
We’re friendly and we’re damn generous,
I’d like to know how many villages in your
country would treat a foreigner to that
after a few months work. That 11 do you
a lot of good. You know it wasn t a remark-
able operation, probably. I might know
and one or two others. But Mrs. Pales
doesn’t, and there are lots like her. She s
related to half Mungmderry Valley. The
Robertses and the Carslakes and the Simp-
sons. All good patients. And this will prob-
ably bring them to you instead of to one
°f the Gundibbie chaps. That s the way it
works here.”
The little printed paragraph had tom
away the covering of Leo’s pride. He felt
naked, confused, ashamed. Had he
come to this? The stern, sunken eyes of
Professor Muri struck ice-cold. He saw the
harsh mouth of the brilliant teacher, the
lonely face with its great beak-like nose, saw
the infinitely suggestive fluttering of the
thin, nervous hand which, in a gesture,
could brush away all vanities, strip away
all the tender veils of illusion. How Muri
would have disdained that—that obscenity!
“You know,” Cartwright was saying, “it
takes time to change the attitude of mind
Q f a community. Why, it seems yesterday
that this town was being served by only
the wrecks of the profession. Remittance-
men, ex-army or -naval surgeons, ruined for
one reason or another. Generally grog,
Now an up-and-coming modern-science
medico, fresh from foreign universities”
But something in Leo’s face prevented
the intended jocularity from maturing.
“Well, see what you can do Leo said,
“I intend to send also a letter to the coun-
cil about this matter of the garbage. You
must do something about R •
Cartwright grinned. All right, bend
them in, if it pleases you.
His tone and his smile evoked an im-
patient gesture from Leo. , „
“You re a good man for the town, John,
he said, but you re too cautious lo
cautious. I see you have squashed the 1 ea
of a gas company. You condemn us to the
candle for another twenty years,
“Wouldn't pay, said Cartwright brus-
quely. You know that as well as 1 do.
“It would pay m time,
“Well, this town isnt going to get into
debt if I can help it.
“Then you won t move very fast. But
it’s your town, not mine.
“Why all this excitement, then?”
On h.s quizzical look Leo left,
{To he continued next week.')


SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Though First Arrow is owned in N. S.
Wales, Merab belongs to Joe Netter, of Adel-
aide, and Phar Lap is mainly the property
of a Sydney sportsman, nearly every winner
at Caulfield on the opening day of tlie
V.A.T.C. autumn meeting was trained
locally. The one exception was Gibsontea,
who divided first place with Clialaki in the
last race. Tindall and his supporters made
a dramatic plunge on Strafford (Moabite —
Medal Tress) for the first division Qf the
Juvenile Handicap. They backed the gelding
from 20 to 1 down to 9 to 2, and witnessed
the supposed good thing whip-in the field.
Mollison, whom Tindall trains for J.
Maloney, was equal favorite with Umbertana
for the first division of the Oakleigh Plate.
On this occasion Mollison departed from
his usual practice of beginning quickly, and
when Bracken applied pressure near the
home turn his mount ran almost off the
course.
This event was captured by Johnstone, the
Sydney jockey, on First Arrow, the neddy on
whom people went nap for the last Don-
caster Handicap. Many profitable thorough-
bred purchases have been effected in Eng-
land by Andrew Robertson on behalf of
A. P. Wade. The 1926 Futurity Stakes
hero, Top Gallant, was one of them, and
now First Arrow lias made good. Trained
at Mordialloc by Lou Robertson, the black
gelding was solidly backed at 6to 1. From
last at one stage he came with a
rush in the straight to defeat Greenline by
a neck. It was a splendid weight-carrying
effort on the part of Greenline, who con-
ceded First Arrow 371 b. No doubt the fact
of Pike being in the saddle made a lot of
difference.
Pike’s superlative skill enabled Merab (5
to 1), another heavily-freighted candidate, to
appropriate the second division of the Oak-
leigh Plate, which unquestionably ought to
have gone to Walvin. The last-named, raced

MAKEME BILIOUS,”
by Vincent O’Neill on lease from bookmaker
Wallace Mitchell, was lengths behind Merab
at the top of the straight, and'had to weave
his way through a crowd of rivals; yet, the
son of Burrabadeen lost by a mere head.
There used to be an Oakleigh Plate and
Oakleigh Purse. This was the first occasion
on which an Oakleigh Plate had to be run
in divisions. Such action was forced by the
new V.R.C. rule prohibiting more than 20
starters in races of a mile and under round
a turn. The V.A.T.C. committee extended
final acceptances (after they had actually
closed) in the hope of avoiding a division,
but could not get the total below 22.
. A. P. Wade sustained a severe loss
when Top Gallant died suddenly at the
stud a few months ago. He looked as pleased
as Punch over the Oakleigh Plate result.
Holdfast maintains his position at the head
of the Newmarket quotes, while Walvin and
First Arrow have advanced to _ the second
line of favoritism, with Waterline next in
demand. Adam Skirving won in 1915 for
“S. A. Rawdon” witli Blague, and is con-
fident of being able to do the trick with
Waterline, whose Williamstown triumph on
February 7 revealed him as _'a high-class
sprinter. Waterline is receiving a special
Newmarket preparation, but may have a go
at the Sydney Cup, all being well.
With Pike up Phar Lap registered an
effortless victory in the St. George’s Stakes.
Glare gave the other three competitors lo
lengths’ start or more in the first half-mile
and overtook them with whirlwind speed at
the home turn. It looked as if he might
finish second, but he tired and the position
went to Induna. This Adelaide colt was
restrained by Dempsey after travelling a
furlong in the immediate wake of Black
Duchess. He handled himself splendidly
afterwards, and left a most favorable im-
pression. Glare and Induna are now equal
favorites for the Australian Cup, but Jim
Truskett may prefer to reserve Glare for
the Sydney Cup, which would bring richer
profit. Stowe lost caste to some extent by
his Bond Cup failure, but he got entangled
in the ruck and is not nippy. Prince Don
won the Bond Cup in fine style, and must be
dangerous at Flemington; but nothing looks
to have a better Australian Cup chance than
Induna.
For Caulfield on Saturday:—
Futurity Stakes: Phar Lap; next, Green-
line.
Stanley Plate: Knight’s Favor; next,
Lighstead.
Platers as consistent as Promptitude are
rare. Second to Halifax in a race at Rand-
wick on Villiers Stakes Day, and interfered
with so badly that his party entered a pro-
test, this four-year-old Promised Land —
Instantaneous gelding has been unbeaten in
his subsequent four starts, and there was a
burst of cheering for horse and jockey
(Knox) when they returned for the weigh-
ing-in ceremony after placing the Flying
Handicap at Canterbury to O. Baldwin’s
credit. Fives was the price, the generality
of punters preferring Beckwith and Ticino.
Both were fairly well up, Ticino being third,
but an outsider, Wedding Feast, was the
only one making any impression on Prompti-
tude at the finish.
Another trustworthy neddy is Calendo, a
three-year-old son of Crescendo and' Calbrook,
whose recent record is second, first, second,
first. F'avorite at 7t04, he definitely proved
superior to the cattle opposed to Jiim in the
second division of the Highweight Handicap,
after Clarence, an equally warm favorite,
had been relegated to third place in the first
division, won from end to end by Lucky
Dane (14 to 1). Zeeland (4 to 1) atoned
in the Canterbury Handicap for his defeat
at Rosehill, Bartle’s shrewd head and skil-
ful hands serving the stable well in an
exciting finish with Hustler (10 to 1). That
horse would have won if the little boy on
top had let him go to the front —he races
best that way—instead of keeping him on
the outside next to Bosmina and covering
lots of ground unnecessarily; but presum-
ably these youngsters have to learn their
trade.
For most of the journey (nine furlongs)
in the Campsie Handicap Amanullah' (20 to
1) looked like furnishing a surprise that
would have been welcome to the Ring, but
he is a bit green yet, and faded into third
place, Aorangi (6 to 1) and Newmarket
Queen passing him over the last bit.
Aorangi’s triumphs are very few and far
between.
For Warwick Farm on Saturday:—
Maiden Handicap: Lord Lucius; next,
Century Tire.
Glenfield Handicap: Sunlit Reef; next,
Remora.
Farm Stakes: Prince Carday; next,
Bloomer.
February Handicap: Inducement; next,
Amanullah.
Minto Handicap: Kilumirri; next,
Kavalli.
“Thormanby”: At long last some news has
been received of Strephon, whose failure to
acclimatise after his transfer to Britain
caused so much heart-burning among Austra-
lian racing followers. The big fellow had
a gallop or two at the end of the English
racing season, but wasn’t within pounds of
his Australian form. However, he seems to
have come on in condition, for the cables say
Sol Green has entered him for the City and
Suburban, run on April 23, and the Man-
chester Cup over a mile and a half on May
29. The City and Suburban, a 10-furlong
spin, used to be a good race for Aus-
tralian horses. Among winners from this
side Newhaven, The Grafter and Australian
Star have figured. The two gallops, whatever
the result, should trim Strephon up for the
job his owner sent him to England for, the
lifting of the Ascot Gold Cup at the end of
June. It is 31 years since the Aus-
tralian nag Merman won this race in the
colors of Lillie Langtry, so it is distinctly
up to Strephon this time.

John Allsopp, who weighed in for
the last time in Sydney the other day,
at 75, was for years a notable figure
on the turf, though failing eyesight took
him out of the game in the end. Born at
Goulburn, he commenced riding at 17, and
after some years of country racing and train-
ing set up for himself in Sydney. At Wilton
House stable he trained for many notable
turfmen, among them being H. C. Dangar
and 11. C. White, and, in later days, Hunter
White. Among the horses he prepared were
Gibraltar (A.J.C. Derby and V.R.C. Leger),
Cremorne (Doncaster and Caulfield Cup),
Ambler (Epsom), Trenchant (A.J.C. Derby),
Paris (Caulfield Cup and Metrop.) and
Lord Ullin’s Daughter (Australian Cup).

“Ibn el Issar”: Victor Sassoon, who won
the Viceroy’s Cup at Calcutta earlier in the
year, closed the season by taking India’s
richest race, the Eclipse Stakes, at Bombay,
with an IrishJbred mare named Some Bridge.
,T. Brace, an Australian, was pilot, and the
third moke, Manipulator, also had an Aussie
at the controls, this being W. Sibbritt, a
well-known Westralian horseman. Sassoon
wound up a good year by giving the cheque
for the prize money (£7500) to Lady Irwin,
wife of the Viceroy, for Indian charities.
* * * *
“Belcher’s”: The Irish sweepstake on the
Liverpool Grand National run in March is
giving the National Hunt Club stewards a
headache. The money forthcoming, even for
ordinary starters, is so big that all sorts of
crocks have been entered —the cost is about
150. Under present rules any horse that
has been registered as a hunter may be nomi-
nated even if he has done no more in the way
of hunting than look on at a meet now and
then. One entry this year is a horse that
has been pulling a van in Liverpool and
has never been jumped over a fence in his
blameless existence. All he and others like
him will have to do is to start, and whether
the first fence is negotiated or not the money
is good.
* * * *
“Le Sport”: France, in strong contrast to
some of the Australian States, is doing all in
its power to push the claims of the tote,
which is the only legalised form of punting
in that country to-day. The elaborate instal-
lations on the principal racecourses have
lately been added to by the placing of branch
totes in the vestibules of cinemas and
theatres, from which the bets are trans-
ferred to the course in time to be included
in the pool. The idea might commend itself
to J. T. Lang, who is reported to be on the
lookout for extra revenue just now.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
The Palmer-Tuzzolini tilt at Sydney
Stadium drew £736. Tuzzolini (list.
51b.) looked, on entering the ring, as
if he thought his prospects of beating
Palmer (list. B£lb.) were very dim. He
was right, for our middleweight champion
outfought him from the first bell. Tuzzo-
lini’s right eyebrow was split in the second
round, and the gash was bleeding so copi-
ously when the eighth ended that the referee
declared Palmer winner on a technical
knockout.

Newcastle Jack Roberts (lOst. 51b.) could
not land any of his noted wallops on Walter
Lee (lOst. 4ilb.) at Leichhardt Stadium last
Friday, and Lee, most of whose deliveries
arrived at their intended destination, won on
points. He dropped Roberts with a right
to the- ribs in the ninth.
The Ins and Outs
After their improved showing in Adelaide
against South Australia, the West Indians
disappointed sadly in the fourth Test at
Melbourne. Going in first on a capital bat-
ting wicket, the side collapsed for 99, Head-
ley with 33 being the only man to make any
stand against Ironmonger (7-23) and Grim-
mett (2-46). Australia tackled the business
of run-getting in brisk fashion, and when
Woodfull closed had 8 down for 328. Pons-
ford went for 24, but Woodfull (83) and
Bradman (152) made a great stand for the
second wicket. McCabe, like Woodfull, was
run out, and Kippax, Fairfax and Oxenham
went for small scores. Lefthander Martin
was the most successful of the visiting bow-
lers with 3 for 91. The W.I. second innings
was a replica of the first, yielding 107 this
time, O. C. Scott, last man in, top-scoring
with 20 n.o. Fairfax (4-31) and Iron-
monger (4-56) were chiefly responsible for
the massacre. There is lio doubt the Buc-
caneers, while making promising showings
in some of their matches with the States,
have acquired a Test-match inferiority com-
* * * *
England set the Afrikanders a stiff hurdle
in the fourth Test on a matting wicket at
Johannesburg, totting up the more than use-
ful first-innings score of 442. Maurice Ley-
land, who looks like becoming England’s
regular left-hand batsman in the days to
come, topped the poll with 91, while Ham-
mond (73) and the consistent Patsy Hen-
dren (64) also seored well. The star turn,
however, was 41 n.o. in 27 minutes with
four sixes by left-hand bowler Yoce, last
man in. Hall, who is a Lancashire lad but
plays for the Transvaal, was the best of
the bowlers taking 4 for 105. The home
side started well after losing Curnow for
Seicllc and Mitchell raised the score to
112 *° r t S e ® eeond • W io ket ;^ h u n n th^o f ? rme l
went to Peebles for 62. Mitchell (68) and
skipper Taylor (20) were not out at the
end of the second day, with the score 2 for
I>b ‘ *
“Aigburth”: Touching that new “Wis-
den’s” (B. 11/2/’3l), it is B. H. Lyon
and not M.D. who has received the accolade
of the editor. B.H. captains Gloucester-
shire, and is one of the side’s most reliable
batsmen. The same editor, by the way,
blames English groundkeepers for helping the
Australians to win the Test series. H'e says
they insisted on producing wickets which
gave the bowlers no chance. That may be,
but in at least two of the Tests, we are told,
the wicket was off-color at times. In any
case the Australian bowlers seem to have
managed all right, in spite of the grounds-
men>
“Shrewsbury’,’: lan Peebles, the Scottish
Oxonian who is at present on tour with
Chapman’s team in South Africa, has taken
the unusual course of voluntarily going down
from the Dark Blue University because his
college refused to grant him the two
terms’ leave required for the tour. Whether
Peebles is well-advised to take this action is
questionable, but that is his own funeral.
The attitude of the dons, while understand-
able, is something new. University under-
graduates have toured Australia with English
teams before now, and these must necessarily
have had much longer leave than Peebles
wanted.
♦ ’ ♦ H* ❖
“W. G. Snort”: Though many will doubt
it, Don Bradman has still some worlds left
to conquer—he needs five more scores over
200 before he can claim the record. He has had
only four seasons in first-class cricket, but he
is four ‘‘doubles” behind G. B. Fry, who, after
some 20 seasons, none of which were in Aus-
tralia, holds the record with 10. Ranji, who
had a comparatively short spin, is second
with 14, while “W.G.” and Jack Hobbs, both
many years in the first-class ranks, tie with
13. Don can now claim 12. In order follow
Ponsford (9) and Trumper, Noble and Arm-
strong (7 each).
* * * *
“Yass”: One of the afflictions of modern
cricket is the eternal reference to the Test
“ashes.” Canberra C.A. wrote to the
Board of Control requesting that the “ashes”
brought back by Woodfull and his merry men
should be stored in the “National Capital.”
It was a surprised and disgusted Canberra
coterie which perused the board’s reply that
since there were no “ashes,” the team had
brought none back, and in consequence there
would be hone to store.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip” : The saddest thing in con-
nection with the financial depression which
has yet touched the heart of the Australian
public is a suggestion that South’ Africa is
uneasy about the exchange proposition, and
that this may result in the cancellation of
the Afrikanders’ tour of Australia. The S.A.
Board of Control is considering the matter,
and then proposes to put the hard word on
its Australian confrere. There doesn’t seem
much to worry about. South Africa, on its
own showing, is having a pretty bad spin
also, but that has not worked against good
gates for the matches with the Marylebone
team.

The Ins and Outs
The West Indies looked to have South
Australia bagged after scoring 383 and get-
ting rid of the home side for 278. The W.I.
first innings ended with skipper Grant (102)
achieving his first century of the tour. Grim-
mett (5-144) and Carlton (3-65) were the
wicket-takers. Bowling at his best, Constan-
tine badly rattled the home side in the early
stages of its first knock, taking 4 for 44 till
he strained his side; Lonergan (36), Lee
(106) and Grimmctt (40 n. 0.) batted stub-
bornly. The Buccaneers, after a good start,
could do no better than 208 in their second
try. . Grant again made good with 42, and
Martin, Headley and Constantine all got into
the 30’s. Lee (5-57) did most of the damage
this time, though Grimmett added another
three to his collection. With 313 to win,
South Australia were left with 266 to get on
the last day before stumps at 4.30 p.m. They
completed the task four minutes before time
with a wicket to spare, Carlton and Walker
managing to fluke the necessary notches. A
stand between Lonergan (68) and Waite
(82) for the sixth wicket saved South Aus-
tralia’s bacon. Victor Richardson (52) was
the only other batsman to look like runs.
* * * *
“Sturt”: A trifle, but probably unique, in
the W. Indies match in Adelaide. Teagle,
12th man for S.A., took the field in place
of a comrade who left it. The very first
ball came to him, hard and low, and Con-
stantine was “c. sub., b. Lee.” With the
incoming batsman the fieldsman came back,
and Teagle retired, his period of service
being that solitary ball.
* £ * *
“Old Q.”: Having properly messed up its
Sheffield Shield season by interference with
the State players, the Q.C.A. has crawled
down from its former haughty perch and will
submit anew rule to members. This limits
the duties of the selection committee and em-
powers a committee of three, consisting of
the captain, vice-captain and another, to
choose the playing side for all matches when
on tour out of Queensland. A complete en-
dorsement of the attitude taken up by the
players in the recent squabble.
* X X X
“Carlton”: The craze for regimentation
which has lately overtaken Australian
cricket authorities is getting boring in the
extreme. The public has been edified with
the spectacle of a cricket Vehmgericht sit-
ting in secret judgment on sinners who have
written forbidden books, or disposed of their
signatures to cigarette manufacturers, or in
other ways done a lot of perfectly inoffensive
things which have no more to do with
cricket than the Rev. Hammond has to do with
rum. The latest lunacy must be debited to
the Victorian Cricket Association. It has
prohibited all cricketers taking part in first-
class matches under its jurisdiction from
signing autograpli-books. The next step will
be to forbid staying up after sunset.
❖ * ❖ *
“Fitzcray”: The Victorian and N.S.W.
cricket authorities have been poking faces at
each other across the Murray again. This
time it is over the absence from the Victorian
side which played N.S.W. in Sydney of the
two drawcards, Ponsford and Woodfull. The
Victorian excuse was that the pair required
a rest from cricket, but N.S.W., remember-
ing that neither was too tired to go to Bris-
bane for the Test, for which a £3O fee was
obtainable, merely snorted derisively. Ma’s
indignation was not lessened by the closing
Victorian comment that she got licked any-
way, so it didn’t matter.
* * * *
“Hotham”: H. C. Sandford, who scored
well against the West Indies for Victoria,
was once looked on by admirers as a Vic-
torian edition of Trumper. A dashing bats-
man with many good strokes, he did only
fairly well in Sheffield Shield cricket for
his State after the war, averaging 20.50 for
12 innings, but never fulfilled his club pro-
mise either in these matches or those for his
State against English teams, and was con-
sequently dropped. Nevertheless he is still
a consistent scorer for Melbourne in pen-
nant cricket, and a regular member of the
first eleven.
* * * x
“Sturt”: In Adelaide cricket the Glenelg
club is prominent for the first time in his-
tory. It has Arthur Richardson, Hack, the
rising hat Catchlove and other solid men,
with the curious advantage (from the club
point of view) that tho selectors don’t draw
on it much for State matches. East Torrens,
with Nitschke and Lee away a good deal,
is a bad second at present; Prospect (with
Wall and Carlton) is third. A lead on
the season’s matches is to mean the premier-
ship outright.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Brassey”: When Sydney City Council
put up the price for a round on Moore Park
from a shilling to eighteenpence there was a
lot of grumbling, especially as the course is
a good profit-maker and is not well main-
tained or ordered. There is now a strong
feeling that the 50 per cent, increase should
be taken off, or at least that some of the
money be used for improving crude sec-
tions of the course. Another badly-needed
reform is* some sort of supervision to -check
the persistent ball thieving, which keeps so
many people away from Moore Park after
one or two trials of it. A patrolman on a
horse or motor-cycle would return his cost
in the price of saved balls a dozen times over
in a year, and sufferers from the present
unchecked pilfering l would return to the
course, the most convenient to the city in
Sydney.
* * * *
“Hoylake”: A sensation in the British
golfing world is the dropping of that bril-
liant young professional Henry Cotton
from the Ryder Cup team. Cotton refused to
sign an agreement that he would not accept
employment in America after the tourney. It
is an unreasonable attitude for the Britons
to take up. Certainly America has lured
away dozens of leading English players, but
there is no reason why these men, who make
their living by golf, should not go to the
best market with' their wares. If Britain
desires to retain her cracks she should offer
them the same prospect of reward which
America holds out. In any case the attempt
to keep Cotton at home is foolish. He is
well known in Yankeeland, where he has
played several times, and if the Americans
want him they will have no trouble in get-
ting him.
* * * *
“Islander”: At the risk of a “please ex-
plain” from the Colonial Office let me record
a recent performance by an associate mem-
ber of the Tulagi Golf Club, which has its
home in the British Solomons. It happened
in the annual contest for the Tulagi Cup,
an open handicap event for which associate
members and those of the inferior sex are
alike eligible. The winner was Mrs. Turner,
wife of the captain, with a score off the stick
of 76 for the IS holes, which a minus-vS handi-
cap reduced to 68. This is a record for the
course for both sexes, and life in Tulagi now
is barely bearable for the male golfer of the
species. Those of his confreres who do not
play golf are positively ribald. Those who
do consider that he has let down badly the
prestige of the white man. As for the native
caddies, their comment from a safe distance
constitutes sorrow’s crown of sorrow.
* * # * *
“Lake View”: American golf is pleased
with itself at the capture from Britain of
a potential champion. This is Charles
Lacey, who was picked out as a promising
unknown in Scotland a couple of years ago
by Scotch-American Tommy Armour. Lacey
has improved out of sight, and now ranks
with America’s best, being acclaimed an
even longer hitter than our visitor-to-be,
“Wild Bill” Melhorn. Furthermore, he has
complete control of his drives, which is where
“Bill” is apt to fall down on occasion. Lacey
is only 23, and this year reached the semi-
fipals of the American professional cham-
pionships.
.... , , * „ '' , ..
“Cash Amateur”: The proposed golf
tourney among Australian professionals to
select a representative m the British Open
this year has been badly set back by the
attaching conditions. As the idea emanates
from a well-known sporting-goods firm
which is paying all costs, it is insisted that
competitors must use only the brand of
ball manufactured by the firm. That would
be all right but for. the fact that the very
best of our professional players aie to a
tied up. under contract to use the p 11
handled by rival firms.

Car and Cycle
“Sandy” : Even more impressive than Mai-
colm) Campbell’s new speed record made
with the 1400-h.p. Blue Bird 11., as an indi-
cation of the efficiency of the modern motor,
was his record of 93.96 m.p.h'. for cars with
a cylinder capacity of under 45 cubic
inch es. This is the baby-car type—4s cubic
inches is equivalent to 737 c.c. —and making
all allowances for special gearing, and, most
probably, a supercharging equipment, a speed
of close on 100 m.p.h. from such a midget
motor—the R.A.C. rating is under 7 h.p.—
is little short of marvellous. With 20
times the power in his huge Napier racer
Campbell got less than three times the
speed. There had scarcely been time to
send out the news of Campbell’s small-car
achievement when .another Englishman, driv-
ing an M.G. car of about the same power as
Campbell’s Austin, pushed the record up to
97.07 m.p.h. on the beautifully smooth con-
crete track at Montlhery in France. The
smoother going—Daytona Beach was
reported to be a bit ripply when Campbell
made his records—would be a great advan-
tage to a car with such a small wheel-base
as is allowed these little 7-li.p. affairs,
* * * *
“Fire Piston” : It may now be taken for
granted that the Diesel-engined car has
definitely arrived. Though his feat was
eclipsed by Malcolm Campbell’s. hair-raising
spin in the Blue Bird, C. L. Cummins, a
noted experimenter with this type of engine,
put.up an official Diesel record of 100.75 m.p.li.
on Daytona Beach in a car designed by liim-
self and built by his company. Last year,
0 n the same course, the same driver attracted
notice at the time of Kaye Don’s attempt
0 n the speed record with a petrol-fuelled
car by putting up a run of 88 m.p.h.
* * * *
“Whizz”: Fast road spins by men
motorists are common enough, but Sydney
got something new the other morning when
it was announced that a Mrs. Wliitycombe
was attempting a record run from Coota-
mundra. Official checkers were in wait at the
G.P.0., and were considerably staggered
when an elderly lady with two children
i n attendance arrived in a car driven by a
chauffeur, and apologised for being detained
by a blowout. All the same, the 276 miles
were cu t out in shr. 38min., an average of
49 m .p.h.—good going on the roads for even
a speed mo del, not to mention a stock car
0 f t h e type used. The lady confesses she
is devoted to speed, and spends much of her
scooting about the country in top gear,
* * * *
“Kick Starter”: A strong contingent of
Australian dirt-track motor-cyclists, headed
b y ictor Huxley, is to invade England for
t £ e coming sea son, which promises -to be
even better than the two previous ones. The
Austr alian-invented sport has caught on
amazingly in Britain, and Australian riders
are among the cream of tbe performers. It
• interest ing to note a recent statement by
Huxley tbat t he “trade” does not provide
j oa< jj Tlg r iders with free motor-cycles, as is
the c * stom in the push-bike game. The
mo t o r-cyclist has to buy his own, and as
mos t 0 f tbe cracks keep four machines in
commission, expenses take an appreciable
cut out of the prize money.
* * * *
“Sprocket” : Australian cyclists have re-
cently been discussing the merits of the
various sprinters ivho at times have visited
this country from overseas, most of them
professionals, of course. The general con-
sensus of opinion favors Arthur Zimmer-
man, the American who was the sprint king
of the world for the closing 10 years of the
last century. Zimmerman, very tall and thin,
came to Australia in 1896. Cycling was very
much' in the boom then, and Australia had
some brilliant performers, headed by Parsons
and Megson. “Zim” got his speed from his
perfect pedalling, always riding a low gear
varying from 64 to 68, with 6iin. cranks,
He never used pedal straps, being content
with plain toeclips. Probably his best per-
formance in Australia was the last 220
yards of a half-mile race on grass at Sydney
Cricket Ground, which he covered in 15
2-ssec. It would be good going on the best of
tracks to-day.

A WOMAN’S
LETTER.
The Lord Mayor’s Fund for the M.L. earth-
quake sufferers was opened last week at the
Town Hall. Many came with cheques, and
there were murmurs of hearty assent
when Knight Arthur iCocks said that
had the disaster occurred in Australia
Maoriland would have been one of the
first to extend a helping hand. Lud
Mayor Jackson’s announcement that the
banks would transfer the relief funds free
of exchange was one little patch of silver
lining on the dark cloud. Merchant princes
like Charlie Jones and George Wright,
theatrical magnates such as C. B. Westma-
cott and Stuart Doyle, and banking experts
like E. C. Riddle are members of a committee
which includes Henry Braddon, Professor
Edgeworth David and Thomas Henley,
M.L.A. Town Clerk Layton and Roy Hendy
are sharing the secretarial work. Before
the fund was opened the purse-bearers had
gathered £444.
The programme for the Maoriland relief
fund concert was almost too elongated,
though each number in itself scintillated like
the Milky ,Way. It was impressive to
see the Papal delegate sweep to his feet, his
amethystine cape rustling, as the first note
of the “Dead March in Saul” flowed out in
sadness. This was the State Conservator-
ium’s requiem for the Maoriland dead,
and in stilly silence the audience stood till
its finish. Sir Philip Game alone repre-
sented Government House, as his lady was
by then half-way to Maoriland. Lud Mayor
Jackson, his wife and Mrs. E. J. Grave-
stock (whose husband organised the concert)
were among the front-seaters. The singing
ladies and violinist Ray Fox were rewarded
by modest posies, and although there were
no speeches the concert did not end till
five minutes to eleven.
Oliver Noel Gillespie writes from Maori-
land :
“There arei no good earthquake stories yet
—everyone is telling the truth. Marvellous
was the calm of the people in the stricken
region, even the chaps in Napier Gaol. After
a ghastly day they turned up at dusk,
saluted the warders and asked ‘Where shall
we sleep, sir ?’ There was absolutely no loot-
ing, no pillaging; complete order in both
little cities.
“Wellington’s City Engineer got word at
twelve o’clock in the capital to go at once to
Hastings to assist in reconstructing the rail-
way line. Hig wife’s mother was at Hast-
ings ; her daughter was sure mother -Would
be quite all right, as she would be
having morning tea on the lawn at
eleven o’clock, the hour when the earthquake
took place. It is five hours by car under
present conditions from Wellington to
Hastings. He arrived there about six o’clock
and naturally looked his mother-in-law up.
She was knitting on the lawn, as her daughter
expected, but when her son-in-law asked
where she was at the time of the ’quake she
said ‘I was in Roachs’ store.’ She was
about to enter the lift when the whole
place collapsed. The lift-attendant, a
young girl, rushed out and was killed by
falling walls before the old lady’s eyes.
Mother-in-law, however, got into the lift,
which immediately began to climb. It rose
to the fourth storey and stayed there. She
waited for two and half hours far above
the ruins of the city until she was rescued
by a fireman. The lift-well was the only
thing left of Roaclis’ store.
“My own little niece, whose father is a sur-
geon in Napier, was at a small kindergarten
school. The next child to her had both arms
broken. The father, called by an urgent tele-
phone message from the commander of the
Veronica, rushed past his house down
to the school, fixed up temporary splints
for the little sufferer, and when he got back
found his whole house burnt to the- ground.
By eleven o’clock the following morning there
were five miles of motor-cars en route with
food and supplies. To-day as I write shops
are open and the towns are functioning quite
normally. Fifteen thousand refugees have been
billeted in various towns, including Welling-
ton. At my seaside home there are some
hundreds, but they are provided with coupons
for the grocers, new clothes and every ordin-
ary necessity of life, although the earth-
quake is only five days old.
“You must remember that Hawkes Bay is
one of our oldest settled provinces. Both
towns have very old buildings which were no
use under earthquake conditions. They
will be rebuilt in very short order. We are
terribly proud, of course, of our naval
men. Morgan and his crowd and Blake
were towers of strength. But still we imagine
that even without them Maorilanders
would have been orderly and decent about the
whole matter. One good friend of mine, the
front of whose warehouse was ripped, told
me that not one single bag of biscuits or
anything in his warehouse was touched by
anybody. He made a distribution on the fol-
lowing morning, and it was as orderly as if
administered by the Salvation Army.”
Dame Nellie Melba is still in St. Vincent’s,
and likely to remain there for some time:
her illness is more serious than was at
first thought. Repeated X-rays did not dis-
close any condition to account for the ex-
cruciating pains which the diva suffers in
the back; but it is now believed that the
trouble is connected with the eyes. Dr.
Pockley has joined the other specialists
engaged upon the case.
When Lord and Lady Baden Powell arrive
here on the 17th they will find a cousinly
greeting waiting them. Cousin is Mr. A.
Powell, of Rose Bay.
What will Sydney say of pianist Mischa
Levitzki when he returns in April after an
absence of 10 years? When he was in Syd-
ney they tell me, he celebrated his
21st birthday, and by that time he was
ramous in almost every country of the world,
lhe great point for the flapper and charity
organiser to note is that Mischa is still
a bachelor.
Portia Geach is back in her old niche at
the Housewives’ Progressive Association. The
live wire has just returned from one of her
periodic jaunts to America, where her head-
quarters are. always the same studio in 59th-
street. While in New York the Australian
did much broadcasting on economic ques-
tions. . One of the association’s plans for
the winter is a class in which women will
be taught how to fashion every conceivable
garment out of wool. Last winter a similar
class drew 150 pupils. For 1930 the House-
wives sent out no fewer than 12,000 receipts
for membership. This year they have ordered
15,000 receipt forms.
Mrs. Tommy Marks was among the homing
people who stepped off the Orontes last
Wednesday. She was looking extremely fit
and intends being even fitter still, for after
a few days at Trelawny, her town home,
she goes off to her Bowral house for the
rest of the summer. Son John, who is travel-
ling to Australia by an Italian boat, arrives
within the next few weeks. The Smarts,
mother, Barbara and Sheila, are by now
settled into their flat at Park-lane Man-
sions. Edith Prior and her aunt, Miss
Marsh, and the Frank Alberts were others
who had crowds of friends to welcome
them.
Padre John Flynn is at his best when his
blue-grey eyes flash with the fires of enthusi-
asm, and his voice glows with the tale of the
Australian Inland Mission. Last week at
the Overseas League rooms he talked to sym-
pathetic listeners, for his audience had come
together for a gift afternoon in the interests
of the A.I.M. travelling library. As ex-
plained by Mr. Flynn, the present method
of distributing the literature would not suit
the reader who wants her novels changed
every day. The books and magazines for the
A.I.M. are shipped to the ports of W.A.;
from, there they drift gradually inland to the
mission stations, and on from there again to
the isolated homesteads. But with time it’s
hoped to evolve a method whereby books may
be sent direct to the most out-back habita-
tions.
Mrs. Hubert Fairfax, who has just
returned to Queensland after her travels in
Europe, received a great welcome home from
th e Country
W omen’s
Ai s s o elation.
The lady holds
something of
a record, hav-
ing been presi-
dent of the
State branch
since its in-
ception : some
five or six
years ago.
The work of
the C.W.A. in
Queensland is
very wide-
flung, and the
women of the
Northern
State are un-
sw e r ving in
their activi-
ties for out-
back sister —
their branch has a membership almost equal
in numbers to that of New South Wales.
To be re-elected year after year to the
leadership of such a company shows the
lady to be equipped with tact as well as
earnestness. Photo, from Dayne.
Another womanly industry seems to have
gone to the wall. This is the twining of rosy
garlands for heroes. The other day when
Guy Menzies, the lone flier of the Tasman,
was received by the Gaud Mayor at the Town
Hall, believe it or believe it not, there wasn’t
one young and beauteous maiden present to
crown him with laurels, not one to coyly
lassoo him with a blossomy rope. When one
thinks how that entry to the civic fastness
might have been stage-managed, tears of
disappointment leak from the eyelids. Charlie
Westmacott or Hugh Ward might have acted
as master of ceremonies. The two-mile-long
silver trumpets given to the Con. by C. L.
Jones in the good old days, when cash was
£ s. d. and not coupons, might have been
fanfared upon by heralds dressed in renais-
sance costumes from the J. C. W. wardrobe.
These should have led a procession up the
steps carpeted with priceless rugs from many
countries (the various Consulates might have
gone bare-floored for one day). After the
herald could have come the new “Daily
Telegraph” disguised as a flapper doing an
old-time waltz. Then in quick succession
a w r hole covey of eurhythmic-prancing
females in Greek tunics, and beach shorts,
plastically strung together by roses red and
roses golden, these to be afterwards used
(when slightly wilted) to decorate the victor.
Rotarians, gladiators, Frank Harvoy, Mr.
Lang, Dot Brunton —and then the hero!
Communism couldn’t live up against that.
Red roses are much more picturesque than
red flags.
Mrs. Stanley Hempton, president of the
Maoriland Women’s Association, though
looking down
in this Dayne
picture is not
at all down-
cast over the
way the relief
fund for the
Maoriland
disaster is
shaping. I n
addition to a
number of
small money-
raisers, Mrs.
Hempton i s
president and
c h i e f-of-stalf
for the ball to
be held at the
Wentworth
early next
month. That
an ounce of
help is worth
a pound of
pity is the thought in the mind of every
member of this group of former Maori-
landers, and each woman is determined to
show her sympathy in the most practical
manner. Mrs. Hempton hails from Wel-
lington, where the winds of the world
meet.
Being a Royalty has its compensations.
Judging by the show of photographs now in
David Jones’s auditorium, the crowned and
near-crowned heads of Europe have
“snapped” scenery and bits of domestic life
in the most interesting parts of the world.
Looking at these pictures one decides that
Royalties must be immune from sea-sickness,
for Prince, Princess, Queen, Duke and
Duchess have evidently blown about the
waterways of the world with no more
troublesome thought than “Did I put fresh
plates in the trusty machine?” Or “Will the
bathroom steward mind if I wait after
my morning bath to develop that bunch of
negatives I took yesterday?” The photographs
are really fine bits of work, and last week,
after his State Ex. had opened the show, a
steady crowd processed slowly before impres-
sive bits of Glamis, a paternal photo-
graph of Princess Elizabeth, and pic-
tures of her family as depicted by
the beautiful and domesticated Queen Alex-
andra. H.R.H. Princess Victoria shows a
nice taste in scenery. One of her bits of
Rapallo might have been taken from Kirri-
billi looking across to Bradley’s Head. The
eight Japanese figures apparently departing
in a row from the Baron Fujita’s party at
Osaka (for only the backs of these guests
are seen) display the magnificent embroid-
eries of their ceremonial robes through the
medium of Prince Arthur of Connaught.
Impressive palaces and buildings, elephants,
boars, tigers and other jungle citizens, besides
simple unsophisticated family photographs,
grace the walls. And if you have a shilling
to spare for the entry, half of it goes to
King Edward’s Plospital Fund and half to
local health institutions.
Tragedy stalked in the quiet reaches of
Greenwich last week; Lindsay Jean Hasle-
ton was found dead, seated at the wheel of
her car in a locked garage. Miss Hazleton
was a 1927 graduate of the Sydney Uni-
versity, and though only 26 was art lecturer
on the staff of the Teachers’ College. She
had travelled extensively and had studied
painting abroad. An etching of herself in
period costume was her last work of art. Jean
specialised in such feminine crafts as designs
for tapestries and embroideries. She was
slim and fair, and her brilliant record at
the Maitland High School and later at the
Uni. gave promise of future distinction.
Francis Due, of Oslo, Norway, married
Eleanor Klisser, of Edgecliff, within St.
Mark’s at Darling Point last week. The
vows were served without any frills. Just
two or three friends, among them the War-
wick Pett couple, drank- the toasts in the
future home of the just-married.
Brisbane sends a letter:—
On the day when the flood was at its height,
cars dashed along the river bank and hooted all
over the flooded landscape, wherever it was possible
for a car to move. From Beenleigh came tales of
the heroic struggles of ambulance men. The
bearers had to wade a mile through mud for an
elderly lady who had fallen downstairs; they
brought their charge for miles along greasy trails
and across swollen creeks, sometimes having to hold
the stretcher above their heads to keep her dry.
In the end they landed her safe in hospital at
Southport. Two other men had a wild trip bringing
by boat to hospital a snake-bitten mate through
floating logs and rushing tides. Cows and poultry
came down in the flood waters, and many snakes.
The Government spared no effort in looking after
the homeless, driven out from the low-lying areas,
and some of the police had no sleep for days and
nights together.
Sir John Goodwin’s first act on the return of
the vice-regal party from Stanthorpe Show was to
pay a visit to the Exhibition Building, where a
number of the flood refugees were housed. The
kiddies were found enjoying themselves vastly as
they paddled or sailed boats on the Exhibition oval.
St. Mary’s, Kangaroo Point, saw the wedding of
John Percival and Ada Margery. The bride, who
was given away by her father, wore a long frock
of ivory bridal satin and a veil of Brussels lace,
and carried a bouquet of white roses, stephanotis
and lilies. Gem Webb and Jessie Levings-
ton ’maided in buttercup mariette frocks, with
picture hats. The bride’s wee sister, Beryl Hicks,
was flower girl in hydrangea-blue. Lennon’s eastern
lounge saw the feast, Mrs. Hicks receiving in powder-
blue. The honeymoon is being spent in Sydney.
The Cecil Palmers had a farewell party to the
De Witt Battys, before their departure for Newcastle,
at Palmarosa, Albion, the house blossoming in many
flowers. The hostess wore black lace with a wide-
leafed pink hat. Mrs. A. H. Whittingham, the
John Hardies, the P. A. Blundells, Peter Macgregor
and Ann Blundell were amongst the throng.
Thomas Dryan married Eileen, daughter of W.
Floris, of Wooloowin, in St. John’s Cathedral. The
bride, who was given away by her father, was in
ivory Duchesse satin and broidered silk tulle veil;
she carried pink and white rosebuds. Vivienne
Palmer ’maided in pink mariette. The reception
was at Atcherley.
The Presbyterian kirk, Ithaca, was adorned with
pink and white for the marriage of Stanley Hiron,
Toowong, to Evelyn May (“Bunny”) Eadie, Red
Hill. The bride, who was given away by her
father, was in ivory mariette and a Chantilly-laee
veil; her shower bouquet was of white roses and
stephanotis. Ethel Eadie ’maided in pink mariette.
The Anne Hathaway cafe saw the reception.
Westralia chips in, too: —
Gordon D’Arcy waited at the Colin-street church
one morning recently for Joan Keane, who kept her
tryst arrayed in georgettes patterned with coral
and pale woodland brown. Rows of fluting adorned
the skirt and the beige hat was wide and shady.
Sister Mollie attended in lime-green and amber
chiffons hemmed with a white flare and worn with
white millinery. She carried a posy of deep cream
rosebuds and fern.
Mr. Justice Draper has announced his engagement.
The lady is Mrs. H. Barker, of Darlington.
A swarm of bright young people squeezed tennis
kit and evening things into suitcases and motored
to Balingup for that township’s annual tennis tourna-
ment. Max Carpenter, Ron Ford, Keith McDougal,
Keith Barker and B. Stapledon were among the
high lights competing. Phyllis and Gwen Brazier,
Phyllis Ilawter, Pauline Phillips, and the Hester
and Wheatley menages each put up a bunch of
guests. There was a dance in Balingup’s new town
hall on the Saturday night.
Christ Church’s music master, Cecil Robert
Donald, died suddenly at Bunbury. His family are
well-known at Yallingup and around Busselton, where
the young musician was educated. He taught music
at New Norcia and for a number of years was
musical director for Allan Wilkie.
Mrs. Canning and daughter Roma have returned
to live in the West after several years in N.S.W.
and Vic.
The Wilfrid Campions are back after seven months’
jaunting in England and Scotland. Mr. Campion
relinquished his job in the Forestry Department
soon after his marriage and bought an interest in a
Fremantle cordial factory.
Though a percentage goes to the unemployment
fund, Prospector Larcombe and his son should make
a good profit out of the exhibition of the Golden
Eagle nugget. Crowds are paying Is. for a peep
at it in the Industries Hall. It looks like a thin
slab of rock, far more golden on one side than
on the other, and it might just as easily have been
called a camel or a bat.
Mollie Beck and Geoffrey Playford were married
quietly in St. Mary’s without the' additions of brides-
maids, groomsmen or a reception. The bride wore
oleander-pink organdie made with deep flares reach-
ing to her satin slippers. A touch of blue about the
waist-line and around the crown of her airy pink
millinery matched her armful of blue hydrangeas.
The ’groom’s parents came over from Adelaide for
the knot-tying.
Geoff Lynn, with his wife and small children, has
gone Fogwards to help run the London office of
Johnson and Lynn for the next two years. On the
same boat went Mrs. Lynn’s sister, Freda Weir, and
Dr. Hildreth Rockett, who is bound for study in
Europe. Gwenyth Ambrose boarded an outgoing liner
with her baggage labelled Toulon.
Fair-sex skippers had a blustery time for their
race conducted by the Perth Yacht Club. However,
stinging spray and a few green waves aboard are
all part of the fun. Miss G. Mackie, at the helm
of Mari Dhu, won for the third time.

Paramount’s “Fast and Loose” is alleged
to be a screen version of Avery H’opwood’s
“The Best People,” but few people who saw
the play would recognise it in its new setting.
The film story is concerned with the amours
of Marion Lenox, a pampered and wilful
blonde, and her brother Bertie, a drunken
weakling. Marion is engaged to an English
peer—one of the blithering idiot type so
dear to the hearts of American producers
—and Bertie is in pursuit of a chorus-girl
who is bent on reforming her tippling swain.
The monocled nobleman bores Marion, and
she steals from her engagement party to
escape his attentions. Whilst moon-gazing
in a seaside spot she encounters a muscular
young swimmer and discovers her real soul-
mate in him. The young man turns out to
be a garage mechanic in her father’s employ,
but that, doesn’t deter Marion, who has
broken with her blue-blooded suitor. Mean-
while Bertie’s father has got wind of the
chorus-girl, and arranges to meet her with
the intention of buying her off. ■ However,
Bertie, tight, as ever, Marion and her garage
mechanic all drop into the meeting-place, an
ornate drinking- and dancing-shop, and
things begin to get mixed, more so when
prohibition officials raid the place. Marion
and Bertie find themselves in quod, and
there is a lot of high-sounding talk from the
chorus-girl and the garage mechanic about
not wanting to marry their respective good-
for-nothings, but it proves to be no more
than talk. Except for one or two blatant
interludes and an artificial ending, the film
is enjoyable. The actors are merely
a tolerable bunch with a reservation for
Charles Starrett as the lowly mechanic, and
Miriam Hopkins as Marion.

Metro-Goldwyn Mayer have produced in
the past 12 months nothing better than “A
Lady’s Morals,” based on the life of Jenny
Lind. Except for the title, chosen appa-
rently to catch the flappers, the film is
without a jarring feature. This is the first
appearance in the screen world of Grace
Moore, the American grand-opera soprano,
who fills the role of “the Swedish nightingale.”
The singer, touring her native country after
opera triumphs abroad, looks in at a road-
side inn. Here she meets Paul Brandt, who,
after she has sung a song he has written,
makes torrid love to her. Their paths
cross again, and the handsome, charm-
ing-mannered young composer manages to
soften the lady’s heart a trifle. Presently
Jenny goes to America, followed by
her lover; but after a spirited rendering
of the “Casta Diva” from “Norma,” at the
Metropolitan Opera House, New York, her
voice fails her. Brandt had predicted such
a happening, and had vainly endeavored to
persuade Jenny to consult his uncle Garcia,
a renowned music-teacher. He is in the
audience when the breakdown occurs, and is
injured in a mild riot in the gallery; and
when he brings Garcia to Jenny to restore
her voice he himself is in danger of going
blind. Garcia breaks the news to the
singer, emphasising the fact that Brandt’s
injuries were sustained while he was cham-
pioning her. The pair return to Sweden,
where Brandt goes blind and quixotically
disappears, Jenny crosses to the States again,
this time to sing for P. T. Barnum, the
circus king. She discovers that Brandt is in
New York, and the pair are finally re-united.
Gx-ace Moore has the most outstanding voice in
Screendom, and her every utterance in this
film is a joy to the ear. In addition to the
“Casta Diva” and an aria from Donizetti’s
“Daughter of the Regiment”—two numbers
rarely heard by the present generation—she
sings pieces by Oscar Strauss, Herbert
Stothart and the lady who wrote “The End
of a Perfect Day.” Other musical details
include a students’ chorus song, a Swedish
pastorale and an exquisite Italian number.
Reginald Denny, who has had more than his
share of trumpery parts recently, is excel-
lent as Brandt, Wallace Beery is a robust
and jovial P. T. Barnum, and Jobyna How-
land makes a hit as Josephine, Jenny’s
chaperone. Sydney Regent orchestra furnished
some excellent music during the intervals —
its rendering of the “Tannhauser” overture
was particularly impressive.

“The Lottery Bride,” a United Artists’
film, seen at Sydney Capitol, is saved from
mediocrity by the abundance of picturesque
Norwegian settings and the pleasant musi-
cal numbers with which it is liberally
furnished. The story itself is a ridiculous
piece of sentimentalism. Jenny, a charming
Norwegian maid, loses her betrothed, Chris,
because he mistakenly believes that she has
surrendered herself to a shady Italian
aviatoi-, whereas she was merely assisting her
brother to escape being arrested on a charge
of embezzlement. Chris flees with a dented
heart to Spitzbergen; Jenny, after a short
term in prison for aiding her brother to
escape, accepts the offer of a marriage
broker to go to Spitzbergen as a lottery
bride. Upon arriving there she finds that
she has been drawn by Olaf, Chris’s whis-
kered but tender-hearted brother, and then
the fun begins. The ai-rival of the Italian
Alberto in a dirigible, which he is flying
aci-oss the North Pole, adds spice to the pro-
ceedings. Following a welter of misunder-
standings, explanations and hei'oic rescues in
the icefields, Jenny and Chris are brought
together in a gaudy color setting. Jeanette
MacDonald uses her fine voice to advantage
as Jenny, though there is i-oom for improve-
ment in her acting. John Garrick and Robert
Chisholm, well known to Australian play-
goers for their work on the legitimate stage,
are excellent as Chi-is and Olaf. Zasu Pitts
and Joe Brown provide some capital comedy
support.

“Sweethearts and Wives,” displayed at
Sydney Roxy with First National’s imprint,
is a mystery yarn with a plot so tangled
and such a confusing lot of characters that
one’s head soon begins to ache with' the
effort of trying to disentangle them, and
discover motives for their actions and ex-
planations for their sinister asides. A
diamond necklace, stolen from an English
peeress whilst she was paying a clandestine
call upon her lover, is the cause of all the
alarums and excursions. The polished and
pleasant-spoken Clive Brook is the hit of
the show as a divorce detective.

Fair punters at the V.AJT.O. meeting
on Saturday found the task of picking ’em
more difficult than usual by reason of the
many entries from other States and Maori-
land. There was; a big crowd, the afternoon
being sunshiny and cool as early autumn.
Dressing was mostly a matter of figured
silk frocks and light woollen coats. Here
and there an early-winter season model
appeared. Mrs. Richard Linton’s gown of
sapphire-blue velvet was figured in pastel
shades and had a cape of black chiffon, and
was topped with a largish hat. Mayor-
ess Luxton was in black with a touch of
green. Mrs. U. J. Nicholas accompanied her.
Mrs. G. A. Fairbairn wore navy crepe de
Chine spotted in white with a blue straw
hat. Mrs. W. M. Robins was smartly
turned out in black and white, and the
magpie effect was likewise the choice of
Mrs. D. P. Mackey. Mrs. Ben Chaffey
sported chiffon in grey and black, and Miss
Macpherson mingled tones of brown and
yellow in her light raiment. Mrs. Clive
Leonard featured Paton pink in her suit
and millinery. Mrs. Richard Turnbull, Mrs.
E. P. Bevan, Mrs. Albion Walkley and Mrs.
W. Mortill pinned their faith to navy blue.
Miniature-painter Agnes Patterson was in
cream. Mrs. A. E. Dunne was a Warrnam-
bool representative, and Mrs. Cyril Dennis
and Mrs. Campbell were visitors from Gipps-
land. Green in various shades was much to
the fore. Nancy Hewlett, lately back from
a fishing trip in the Apple Isle with her
father, Dr. Hewlett, wore a coat-frock of
reseda green tweed topped by a felt hat of
the same tone with touches of white. A
gorgeous garment in chiffon was pale green
spattered with water-lilies in a darker tint
outlined in gold. This was worn with match-
ing shoes and hat. One of the smartest
coats was black with embroidered woollen
flowers about the hem. Mrs. Merson Cooper
was companioned by Marie de Bavay. Mr.
and Mrs. James Purves and Florrie Green
were there. Guests of the club were the
English visitors Major and Lady Margaret
Loder; Major Loder’s brother was the owner
of Spearmint.
The charity race-meeting at Moonee Valley
was favored by fine weather ; but, like all such
affairs, it didn’t attract much of an attendance
to the more expensive parts of the course.
Proceeds were divided between the Civil
Ambulance and the Benevolent Home and Hos-
pital for the Aged and Infirm. Among the good
sports who did roll up were Mrs. Ben Chaffey,
Miss Macpherson, Mrs. Rogers Thomson, in
black and white spotted tailored suit and
black hat, Mrs. J. B. McArthur and Mrs.
A. V. Kewney. Mr. and Mrs. Harry Austin,
of Hay, were there to see their horse Kala-
shie win the hurdle race. Secretary A. V.
Hiskens’s wife had a party at tea. which
included her daughter Mrs. R. Irving and
Madge Taylor, of Overnewton. Mrs. Barry
Thomson and Miss Ross Fenner were
amongst those who tried to pick winners. The
course was a color symphony in which ver-
dant lawns and rosy petunias predominated.
The upstairs chamber of the Town Hall
bloomed with the glory of the garden on
Thursday, when the Royal Horticultural
Society staged a show. Mrs. J. S. Oliver, of
Essendon, made a gorgeous patch of color
with baskets of orange and ruddy shaded
montbrescia, groups of huge zinnias and but-
terfly delphiniums. Another member special-
ised in gladioli of many varieties. Lupins
of various tints and masses of delphiniums
were contributed from yet another garden.
Fuchsias were a strong feature of the show,
and there were even some roses.
The begonias grown by the City Council
in the Fitzroy Gardens conservatory are
splendid this year. There is a show of some
200 varieties of the camellia-like blooms.
A great sheaf of white and gold lilium
auratum was held against Brenda Bowman’s
gown of deep parchment-toned satin when
she became the wife of lan Baldock Mac-
dougall, at St. John’s, Toorak. The bridal
veil was of tulle of the same tint as the
gown. Margaret Beauchamp ’maided in a
frock of tangee hue. At the Windsor after-
wards the Athol Bowmans spread a feast,
to wffiich a few relatives and intimate friends
were invited.
Cora, daughter of the A. J. A. McLeods,
of Naranda Downs station, Queensland, ex-
changed vows at the Collins-street kirk witn
Donald, son of Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Fraser,
of Emu Plains station, in the northernmost
State. Lace of the tint of mushroom pink
topped by a fine straw hat formed the
bride’s array, and she carried a bouquet of
cactus dahlias. Mrs. C. H. Brock, attendant
matron, sported amber-tinted draperies with
a hat of the same shade. There was a
celebration afterwards at Menzies’.
In the fashions for winter there is a
mingling of various periods. Evening
gowns go back to a distant era; costumes
and coats derive from a later day. Party
frocks for young girls are reminiscent of
the early-Victorian mode, being long and
full of skirt and close-fitting of bodice. Frills,
ruches and designs in idbbon or wool consti-
tute the embellishments. A frock of this
sort seen at a dress parade last week was
of parchment chiffon velvet splashed with
orange : colored roses in wool. A narrow
basque finished the high-waisted bodice. For
the mature person, one of the most attractive
gowns was a black satin, the draped bodice
of which melted into a gracefully cut train.
A fan of black ostrich-feathers went with
this attire.
Day coats are shaped to the figure and
the lower parts are flounced or pleated. High
fur collars are featured. Belted tweed coats
are shown, very attractively cut. The tailored
coat and skirt, which will continue to hold
the field, will be well suited by the new coats,
which are of various lengths, from those
that end just below the waist to three-
quarter extent. Sports suits promise to
remain as they were.
An alluring feature of a mannequin
parade of winter fashions last week was a
display of model gowns, coats and skirts
made by fashion experts of England. France
and the U.S.A., shown side by side with
replicas turned out in a Melbourne work-
room. Two girls with similar figures donned
the original and the copy respectively and
it was a hard job to tell t’other from which.
But there was a very palpable difference in
price, the Australian-made garment in some
cases costing only a fourth as much as the
imported attire. The new fashions are
mostly throw-backs —a tailored Russian
belted suit of black facecloth having a
large collar and bordering of broad tail
fur was reminiscent of pictures in the school
history-books. Waistcoats of contrasting
material were another echo from the past.
A brown coat and skirt with tuck-in cream
blouse and a waistcoat pin-spotted in white
was a typical example of this mode. Simple
coat frocks with a line of bone buttons down
the front were another resurrection, and —
crowning vagary—the hideous leg-o’-mutton
sleeve has made its reappearance, though not
in so prodigious a size as of yore. A new
material shown was diagonal romaine, appa-
rently a near relative of the tweed family—
very warm-looking and smart. All outdoor
clothes were worn with matching millinery
based on the beret pattern. There is plenty
oi color in the new styles. Wine and grecu
tones and black are likely to be most popular.
Dr. A, C. D. Rivett, who has been making
an investigation into industrial matters in
Britain, and his wife, who accompanied him,
were welcomed home with a luncheon at the
Windsor. The gathering was convened by
the Allen lady, who occupied the chair and
spoke the greetings. The color scheme of the
decorations was red, white and blue, carried
out in lilies, cactus dahlias and delphiniums.
Medical-knight James Barrett returned
thanks to Dr. Rivett for an edifying address.
Mrs. Rivet't, who is a daughter of the great
Alfred Deakin, was in dark brown, bright-
ened with fawn satin, and a ficelle straw hat.
Among the guests were Uni. Chancellor Mac-
farland, the Herbert Brookeses, Mrs. Alfred
Deakin, Prof, and Mrs. Ernest Scott and
Edward Mitchell and his lady.
The regatta on the Maribyrnong River
was a pleasant affair. Improvements have
been made on the banks in the matter of
terraces and avenues of trees, and there were
gaily-colored marquees where afternoon-tea
was spread. A parade of decorated canoes
was an attractive feature, and the races
were stoutly contested. Ten crews of athletic
young women competed in junior and senior
fours. Sydney sent a quartette that won a
heat but was eventually beaten. Mayor
Fenton, of Essendon, made the oration that
set the carnival going, and with Mrs. Fenton,
who wore floral draperies, he entertained
several friends at four o’clock tea. Ex-
Federal Minister Fenton and his daughter,
Mr. and Mrs. 11. Schwieger, Mr. A. L.
Drakeford, M.L.A., and Mrs. Drakeford were
guests of the Mayor.
The entries in the Semco annual needle-
work competition have been on exhibition
at the firm’s premises in Collins-street. There
is one from Egypt and another from a
mission school in Samoa, all the rest coming
from Australia and Maoriland. Particularly
attractive were the exhibits of white crochet
of very fine texture. Miss Secombe, of
Norwood (S.A.), gained first prize, with
Olive Garden as runner-up. The junior sec-
tion shows a marked improvement on last
year’s standard.
The Dickinson-Monteath studio pictures
here the wife of the Rev. Leonard Arnold,
of the Melbourne Boys’ Grammar School.
Professionally known as Louie Dunn, she
has taught
many in this
city to speak
verse and
prose, having
learnt her art
from Claude
Hall. Since
changing her
name she has
taken only a
few pupils.
Last year at
the Ballarat
competit ions
the lady and a
little company
o f students
put on - per-
formance o f
“The Best
P e o p 1 e,”
which gained
all prizes in
its section.
She has offered her services and those of her
team to help the campaign to collect £50,000
for the blind.
One of the show-places of the country-
side round Melbourne is Major R. A.
Money’s gladiolus farm. Here on an area of
seven acres 160 varieties of gladiolus are
now in full bloom. They need a good deal of
attention but no watering—the dews and
the rain supply all their requirements in that
direction. Ten years ago Major and Mrs.
Money took up this land on Mt. Evelyn,
which is some miles out of Lilydale. When
they started they knew very little about
the business, but they’ve learned a lot since.
While the gladioli last they supply one city
firm alone with 300 bunches a day, and the
weekly output amounts to 300 dozen
bunches. These orders keep five girls em-
ployed in picking and tying the flowered
spikes into bunches. Visitors are admitted
on handing over a small donation to Mel-
bourne hospital. About 400,000 bulbs have
to be dug up and turned over every year.
Major Money, served with the Royal Engi-
neers in the Great War, and took to flower-
farming for health reasons.
Pianist Ada Freeman, who has been
abroad for some months, has returned full
of high hopes for her talented pupil Nancy
Weir, whom she has left to continue her
studies in Berlin. Miss Weir’s new teacher
is Herr Schnabel, one of the most learned
of Germany’s musical pundits, and he is
delighted with the ability displayed by his
young student.
The jam factory established to provide
work for some of the unemployed girls and
free jam for necessitous families had a set-
back last week. Mean thieves broke inland
stole the whole stock of sugar—3s 701 b.
bags.,-
Archbishop Head and his wife are intro-
ducing to their friends their son, J. W. Head,
who arrived last week from England. He
is to spend some months in Australia before
returning to finish his education at Trinity
College, Cambridge.
A game that is making itself popular as
a 'home pastime is mirror golf, which is an
old idea revived. As everyone who has tried
it knows it isn’t the easiest thing in the
world to trace a pattern on a slate or piece
of paper keeping one’s eye upon the reflected
design in a mirror. In the game of mirror
golf a course is sketched out on a card about
9in. by Tin., and fairways, bunkers, hazards
and putting-greens are negotiated by trailing
a pencil with an eye, not on the iinks, but
on the reflection of the diagram in a small
looking-glass held to show each hole.
When Frank Gavan Duffy was sworn in
as Chief Justice of the High Court, on-
lookers at the ceremony included his lady
and various
members of
his family,
who occupied
the jury-box.
The same
nfternoon, ac-
companied by
his son, Father
Guy Duffy, of
Gordon, the
newly-ap-
pointed C.J.
left to preside
at a sitting of
the High Court
at Hobart. The
Duffy lady,
pictured here
by Broothorn,
is Australian-
born, a daugh-
ter of the late
John Richard
Torr, an Eng-
lishman who had business interests in Mel-
bourne. Her mother was Irish, and she
inherits many of the characteristics of the
daughters of Erin. The Chief Justice’s wife
has interested herself in many philanthropic
activities, but has now limited these to the
Toorak branch of St. Vincent’s Hospital
Auxiliary, of. which she is a vice-president,
and the Sacre Coeur Kindergarten, of which
she is president. She was for 13 years a
member of the committee of the Children's
Hospital. Five years ago she toured Britain.
The Duffys celebrated their golden wedding
last April.
The George Peacocks and their family
have returned to their Glenferrie home after
spending some weeks at Portsea.
Major R. B. Loder and his wife, Lady Mar-
garet Loder, of Maidwell Hall, Northamp-
ton, halted at Menzies’ Hotel for a few
days on their way to stalk deer in Maori-
land. This is their ninth overseas trip, and
they have hunted big game in many parts of
the globe. The lady says, she has potted
a rhinoceros or two, but has yet to shoot
a lion.
Mrs. lan Macdonald, Gertrude Dix that
was, has taken up residence here again for
some time. Her husband, a naval officer, has
.just got over a serious illness, from which he
convalesced at the Otway Falkiners’ home-
stead. He will most probably be attached
to the Navy Office here until fit to rejoin
his ship. The Macdonalds have rented Dr.
Travers’s home in Wallace-avenue, Toorak.
Freda Bage, principal of the Women’s Col-
lege of Queensland Uni., has been visiting her
mother, Mrs. E. Bage, of Kew. With a party
that included her sister Ethel Bage and
Winifred Moore, of Brisbane, Miss Bage
spent part of her holidays motoring through
Gippsland.
Representatives of the medical staff of the
Women’s Hospital welcomed Sir Gould May,
gynecologist of the Grosvenor Hospital for
Women, London. Sir Gould is accom-
panied by his sister-in-law, Lady May, widow
of Sir Francis May, who was Governor of
Fiji in pre-war days. They came by the
Mongolia and propose to spend several weeks
in Fiji.
Flowering gums are now in full bloom, and
they make a brave display of creams, pinks,
oranges and reds. The huge tree at the
Metropolitan golf links is a mass of scarlet,
and people make pilgrimages to see it. This
year they have to pay, an entrance fee being
charged. The money will be handed over to
some hospital or other charitable institu-
tion.
Margaret Jean Dann, of Firbank Girls’
School, has won a scholarship in agriculture
at the Uni. She is a daughter of the super-
intendent of workshops at Yallourn, and has
for some time been engaged in scientific
research. Women in this State are proving
efficient, farmers —a score or more have
holdings in Vic. One of them, Miss Jackson,
of Elmore, won the first prize in the Agricul-
ture Department’s Mayah wheat competition.
Just joined the ranks of the authors is
Mrs. George Swinburne, whose late husband
founded and endowed the Swinburne Tech-
nical College. She has written a book for
children entitled “Buzziwig,” which has been
illustrated by Elma H. Kilgour and will
shortly be published. Mrs. Swinburne is not
the first of the family to dabble in ink. Her
daughter Gwendoline, who is an M.A. of
the local Uni., has published a work on Aus-
tralian history.
Frances Fraser, of this city, has returned
after a year in Italy, during which she
renewed her acquaintance with many favorite
places and explored new fields. She lectures
about her travels, and some of her remarks
on such topics have been broadcast.
From the Little Sister at Adelaide:—
It was reserved for the president of the Adelaide
Ladies’ Rowing Club (Mrs. Lavington Bonython) to
christen the club’s new boats at the City Bridge
boathouse. She was received by Miss E. Goetz. Mrs.
Bonython wore a white and grey patterned georgette
frock, with cape effect, and a large silver grey
straw hat. Miss Goetz was ii* a pale-pink
embroidered georgette, with a black straw hat.
A bottle of Minchinbury was attached to
the bows of each boat with the club colors and
Mrs. Bonython shattered them with such a
convincing stroke that both ladies were soaked in
wine. One boat was christened Miss Adelaide and
the other Jo Thomas, after the club’s hon sec.
Guests present were afterwards entertained at after-
noon tea.
The Barcarolle and the Railways Institute Ladies’
Rowing Clubs have now amalgamated and will have
a boat-christening ceremony shortly. They gave
a very successful flannel dance on Wednesday night,
the girls wearing their smart green flannel blazers
edged with red and gold.
At the Amateur Turf Club’s meeting at Chelten-
ham, Mrs. A. V. Benson officiated as hostess in the
absence, through influenza, of the chairman’s wife,
Mrs. J. H. Morish. Figured crepe de Chine is
still first favorite in the matter of frocking, and
the weather was warm enough for chiffons. Mrs.
Benson’s black crepe de Chine was patterned in
beige, and her baku black straw hat had a wide
brim.
The Mayoress (Mrs. C. R. J. Glover) has issued
invitations for an at-home next Wednesday as State
president of the Girl Guides’ Association. It is a
farewell to Mrs. Arthur Lewis, who is leaving
shortly for England. The party will be held in
the Mayoress’s reception-room.
Dr. Christina Krakowsky and her daughter Eliza
beth are returning to Adelaide by the Narkunda.
And Hobart sends a few lines: —
Regatta Day was one of glorious sunshine from
dawn to dusk. The only people who weren’t suited
were the skippers of the sailing craft, for the usual
rattling sea breeze was missing. The deep blue
Derwent was a-flutter with white sails, and that
natural grandstand, the Domain, was packed with
people. J. G. Turner, the veteran president, enter-
tained the Lieut.-Gov., the Rear-Admiral, the Naval
and Military Commandants and other notables at
the official luncheon.
In the afternoon Captain Holbrook and the officers
of the Canberra dispensed hospitality, and the
launches ran like water-beetles between the ship
and the shore. The Lieut.-Gov. and his lady, with
Private Sec. H. Brettingham-Moore, were among
the guests, also the Premier and Mrs. McPhee,
Bishop Snowden Hay and Mrs. Hay, the Cox Taylors,
knight Elliott Lewis and his lady, the Rear-Admiral
and Mrs. Evans, the Tom Murdochs, Mr. and Mrs.
Thos. Lyons, Mr. Justice Clark and Mrs. Clark,
Dr. Lindsay Miller and many more.
Mrs. Sam Cox has returned to the mainland after
a visit to her mother, Mrs. Tom Lyons. Mrs. Eric
Stopps, a visitor from Norfolk Island, is staying
with her parents, the S. T. Chancellors. The
Misses Hoot-Brown have returned to Sydney after
several weeks in the Speck.
Archbishop Hayden laid the foundation stone of
the new building at Mt. St. Canice before a crowd
which refused to be damped by the untoward
weather. The building will contain four reception
rooms for visitors, a new refectory, additions to
the kitchen and a new community wing.
The City Hall was ablaze with brilliant color
for the Horticultural Society’s gladioli show. Dahlias
and sweet-peas and other late summer blooms were
there, too, but the gladioli held the centre of the
stage. The champion bloom, raised from a seedling,
was shown by W. Jackson.
Gertrude Jacob, B.Sc., New York, who lectures
on health matters wherever she goes, gave some
interesting talks here. She is the author of “Per-
sonal Hygiene” and the “Girls’ Friendship Book,”
and for some years conducted health classes in the
Thomas Jefferson High School, Brooklyn, where
there are 7000 students.
The L. F. Piesses made a big splash over
daughter Wanda’g coming-of-age ball. The Conti-
nental was decorated in pale pinks and - blues, and
there were about 300 guests, among them the
Rear-Admiral and Mrs. Evans; naval uniforms were
everywhere. Mrs. Piesse and her daughter received
at the entrance to the ballroom, the former in
black ring velvet and black silk fisher net, the
latter in a charming frock of white romaine, very
long and flaring and cut low at the back, the bodice
line defined in flat white camellia petals. Eight
young things in white raiment, made their bow to
“Sassiety”—Shiela Maxwell, Betty Ross-Reynolds,
Lyn Drury, Mary Harbottle, Pat Walch, Noelle
Guesdon, Sheila Crawford and Margaret Fysh. The
young hostess had the happy idea of presenting
each of the debs, with her initials in gold attached
to a wrist ribbon.

DAVID WORTH’S FINE STORY OF A BUSH FIRE AND A BRILLIANT
DESCRIPTION OF THE THING ITSELF.
THE great blood-colored disc sank behind
Harmer’s sheds, and took with it all
the air there was, so that the weary
firefighters struggled for breath.
The copper haze of the afternoon turned
to a powder blue, which filled the little valley
and blotted out the sheds, and then the
homestead, and soon all but the nearer trees.
The blackened landscape stood still; the
tortured trees that had shrieked and thrashed
in agony now smouldered silently, and the
smoke of their burning rose straight and
disappeared in the haze.
The men looked at one another with blood-
shot eyes; they spoke in hoarse and ghastly
whispers. One said “She’ll burn quiet now.”
Tom Harmer threw away the bedraggled
branch with which he had thrashed the last
fire-imp to death. It fell on a red-hot heap
of ashes which had been a pile of cut posts;
the limp remaining leaves screamed and
writhed* then died in postures of agony and
vanished in flame. “Thanks, you fellers,”
he said.
A murmur of deprecation ran among the
six or seven men. In the growing darkness
they moved to depart, walking stiffly. A
hoarse voice said with ghastly levity, “Gawd!
I could sink a pint or two !” There was no
response.
As they stumbled wearily down the hill-
side to the dusty track, several called back,
“Good-night, Tom.” “Night, Tom.” Stand-
ing woodenly by the ruins of a post-and-
rail fence, he answered “Night, Syd” or “So
long, Ben.”
A tussock crackled suddenly into bright
flame; the red plant threw greedy tendrils
at the hanging bark of a near-by tree, ran
up the tall trunk like a swift-growing, lumi-
nous parasite, then vanished, and darkness
took possession of the departing figures.
Tom Harmer turned and walked wearily
towards the sheds on the cleared rise. Be-
hind him a thunderous crash told of the fall
of a burnt-out tree; occupied with sullen,
bitter thoughts, he did not notice it.
The patient cows waiting at the sliprails
followed him to the bails, and the leader,
horning away a presumptuous heifer, took
her place. Harmer drank deeply from the
corrugated tank which caught the rain from
the roof, and washed his hands ; then, taking
an upturned bucket from the corner post, he
dragged a kerosene-case under the cow for
a seat and commenced his delayed milking.
The first milk skirled into the bucket; he
rested his weary back by pressing his head
into the flank of the old cow, who leaned
maternally to meet him; the sloshing of two
pencils of milk into the rising white tide
produced a melodious murmur, soothing to
both Harmer and the cow, which chewed
its cud with a quiet contentment punctuated
by occasional asthmatic gasps.
Harmer brooded sullenly; the physical
exhilaration of fighting had passed, and
weary depression presented every detail of
his situation in its worst aspect. All that
fencing to be done again, just to prevent
obstinate cattle from leaving the poor feed
of the farm to wander restlessly in the use-
less scrub and rubbish on the hillside! Not
that he blamed them, if they were as sick
of the place as he was. Work, work; slave,
slave; and nothing to show for it but a
few acres of poor ground which barely sup-
ported a dozen indifferent cows and returned
a meagre living to his parents and himself!
He should have cleared out when he was
younger, instead of remaining dutifully to
bear his father’s burden. In a short, and
for him unusual, period of self-pity he saw
himself and Lizzie Henry in a prosperous
Mallee home half-hidden in a rolling sea
of waving wheat —something he had never
seen, but which, from his limited reading,
had impressed him as the antithesis of his
surroundings. Sometimes in this picture
there were children —freckled, lanky young-
sters.
The old cow, milked dry, backed out with
a clatter of horny hoofs, and the next in
social standing took her place. Again the hard
skirl of the first milk stream gave place to
a soothing, rhythmical swish, very conducive
to dreams.
He should have cleared out like young
Stan—he’d have got more thanks, anyway.
But it was too late now—when a man was
nearly forty. Stan, in the infrequent letters
his mother received, was always going to do
something wonderful, but somehow never did.
Twelve years younger than Tom, and the
only other survivor of five, Stan had been
the baby while Tom slaved long hours on
the farm, then still in the pioneering stage.
As Stan grew old enough to work, the need
for a worker was not so great, and he en-
joyed easier times, with a proportion of sheer
idleness. Attracted by the wages, he had
first left home to become a sawmill hand
at Vaughan’s, about three miles up the val-
ley; had left that to go rabbiting, then
fruit-picking, then wharf-laboring in the
city, and after that they had heard from
him perhaps once in every twelve months, and
always from a different place. The last had
been from a western country town, where
it was understood that he was some sort of
engine attendant in an iceworks. And now
he was back at the mill —just a little way
up the valley.
Cow after cow stepped forward to take
its turn in a jealous order of precedence,
each treading daintily into the dark shed,
backing out when milked, with a clatter of
horny hoofs and a snort of interrupted chew-
ing; each vanished in its turn into the dark-
ness, whence came the sound of a cow lying
down, followed by a grateful sigh and then
a sound of chewing.
In an unhappy weariness Harmer fore-
tasted the future, with the prodigal son
basking in the affection his mother never
spent on her eldest, borrowing freely from
the old man the money Tom seldom saw, and
was then but a grudged half-crown. With
a snort of disgust he startled the last cow 7
out of the bail; he picked up the buckets
of milk and went to the ramshackle dairy,
from which presently arose the complaining
whine of an ancient separator.
* * * *
Hot waves of stifling air preceded the rising
sun. The cows standing at the shed snuffed
the air uneasily. As Harmer sat milking
them he noted unconsciously that the blue
smoke rising from the smouldering paddock
tended to .drift southward up the valley,
almost at right angles to the direction of
yesterday’s fire. Uneasily he hurried through
the milking; every available man would be
needed at the little sawmill township, for
every portent indicated a red-hot day with
a fiery north wind urging the fire in a new
direction, and on a frontage of miles. The |
farm would be safe; yesterday’s fire had re- j
moved all danger. But the cluster of homes
and stores about the sawmill, shut in on
every hand by timber and scrub which was
choked with undergrowth thickly grown
during two damp years and now inflammable
as tinder in this hot, dry season, would be
in the gravest peril. And just as his neigh-
bors and several sawmill hands had come
unbidden to his assistance, so he by the
unwritten law of the bush would fight to
the last for his neighbors.
By nine o’clock his long stringy legs
were striding along the winding dusty track
up the valley. On his shoulder he carried
liis axe; from time to time he glanced • un-
easily to the left, where a mile or so away
a huge fire raged along the ridge. The roar
and crackle of its advance could be heard
plainly above the bellowing of a northerly
gale, which thrashed and twisted the trees
by the side of the track, and whipped the
hot dust into blinding clouds.
Half a mile from the mill he met a body
of men feverishly attacking the scrub and
deep, dry bracken with axes and slashers, cut-
ting a swathe across the track of the on-
coming enemy. One man fired the scrub to
windward of this swathe and shepherded the
fire back against the wind. Women brought
hot tea in buckets, from which the men
drank scalding draughts. Several of the
men who had helped Harmer on the previous
day greeted him.
“Day, Tom.”
“G’day, Syd. Pretty fierce, ain’t she?”
“Too honest, she is. We’re in for a hot
time, all right.”
Lizzie Henry, the storekeeper’s daughter,
now middle-aged, gaunt and stringy, like
Harmer, came to him with a bucket of tea.
“Good day, Lizzie. Thanks; it’s hot, ain’t,
it ?”
“Do you think they’ll head it off, Tom?”
“She’s coming pretty fierce, Liz, but I
think we’ll do it.”
The swathe advanced. The labor in-
volved—the physical exertion —tended to
allay thought. The acrid smoke from the
protective fire filled the forest, and the sound
and smoke hid the advance of that other.
High overhead the wind raged amongst the
tree-tops.
Presently it occurred to Tom that there
should have been more men available. He
asked of his neighbor, “Where’s all the
fellers?”
“Gorn over to Wombat yesterday to the
cricket.”
Wombat was another settlement about 18
miles to the west. After playing all the
previous afternoon the men would hang about
drinking and arguing until this evening, and
would not get back until night.
Tom flared up. “They oughter had more
sense—anybody ’d know she’s likely to get
away at this time of the year.” He struck
right and left with the axe, savagely, for
the night’s brooding had left him sore. "I
suppose old man Henry took ’em in his
truck.”
Suddenly a thought came to him; he
turned again to his neighbor. “Where's
young Stan? They tell me he’s working at
the mill now.”
“Yairs. He took his dog over to Wombat,
too; there's hare-racing or somethin’.”
Harmer flung his axe down in a sudden
rage. Hare-racing! Scathing words formed
on his lips. But lie never spoke them.
“My God, Syd, look! She’s nearly on us. ’;
Under cover of the noise and smoke, the i
enemy had advanced rapidly. As Tom spoke,
a sudden access of noise drew the atten-
tion of the entire working party. A roaring
wall of flame showed redly through the
smoke three hundred yards away. The
forest was full of noise; full of the crack-
ling, roaring flame advancing like some
triumphant horde; full of the shrieking of
burning trees, with intermittent explosions
as the sap boiled in their veins; full of the
scurry of animals and birds fleeing in terror;
full of the roar of the gale in the tree-tops—
the whole producing a terrifying pande-
monium.
An cry went up; green
branches were hurriedly hacked; axes were
dropped and all stood ready. The protective
swathe was not half long enough; they could
but fight and attempt to steer the fire around
and past the settlement. Burning bark and
branches fell near by, setting fire to the
scrub and bracken. Wherever the red
menace fell and flourished it was thrashed
into nothing by vigorously-wielded branches.
These were the scouts; they required but
quick and fearless handling. The great red
wall, high as the side of a house, was a dif-
ferent matter. Already the heat from it was
uncomfortable. Paces showed red m its
tremendous glow; eyes and teeth glittered
redly through the smoke; the sheen of sweat-
drenched muscles was like new-cut copper.
Hands reached quickly for a pannikin of hot
tea, eyes never leaving the wall of flame
that advanced rapidly and inexorably.
A burning branch fell at Harmer’s feet,
making him look up quickly. The tree-tops,
were on fire; the enemy, impatient ih the
undergrowth, had taken to the tree-tops,
where, with the help of its ally, the north
wind, it travelled at incredible speed.
Already as he looked a sheet of flame covered
the swathe as with a ceiling. He turned to
shout the news to his neighbors, and found
them retreating in disorder, his nearest
neighbor shouting faintly to catch his atten-
tion. He pointed to the rear and ran. He
saw a sudden great burst of flame, and
black pygmies thrashing desperately. Burning

RHEUMATISM, LUMBAGO
CHRONIC BACKACHE, SCIATICA
If you are a victim of Rheumatism,
dreadful Backache, if you are feeling
worn-out, hating work and with no
zest for pleasure, your strength just
“ giving out,” if you are having bad
nights, it is practically certain that
Kidney Trouble is the cause of your
serious condition.
<52,
V
This illustration shows the excess of
uric acid■ crystals formed in the blood.
These lodge in joints and muscles and
set up the inflammation that causes
the dreadful pain you refer to as
rheumatism, lumbago, backache, joint
pains, etc.
RATIONAL TREATMENT
As explained above, DeWitt’s Pills
constitute the ideal treatment for
uric acid ailments because they go to
the root of the trouole —the kidneys.
De Witt’s Pills have no effect on any
organs of the body except on the
kidneys. The ingredients have been
specially compounded for this purpose.
Try De Witt’s Pills now.
The kidneys, in health, act as the
great cleansing and purifying centre
for every drop of the body’s blood
supply. They should filter and
pass out from the system any excess
of uric acid and other pain-giving
poisons. When they fail in their
duty, your health fails and pain
and suffering result.
As long as those harmful bacteria,
uric acid or poison (toxins) are in
the blood you will suffer. Oint-
ments used from outside will not
help you. There is only one thing
to do and that is to prompt the
kidneys to clear out from the body
the pain-giving impurities, and this
we tell you clearly De Witt’s Pills
will do.
It is no use doping the system
with heart-exciting drugs, pick-me-
ups or purgatives, when the trouble
lies in your kidneys. Get a bottle
of De Witt’s Pills to-day and start
to end your suffering and build
strength, vigour and vitality. De
Witt’s Pills, because of their pop-
ularity, have been imitated. Other
kidney pills there may be, but
for your own health’s sake, and
your pocket’s sake, refuse all im-
itations. Ask for and see you get
“ De Witt’s.”
Remember, every bottle of De
Witt’s Pills sold bears a guarantee,
and is backed by recommendations
of tens of thousands of cured suffer-
ers, many who have come through
years of untold agony to per-
fect health. The price of the
usual size box is 3/6 only.
Surely the expenditure of so
small a sum is weli repaid by
the end of chronic suffering
and the return of splendid
vigour and vitality.
The following are just two of the letters constantly received:
WEEKS OF PAIN—QUICK RELIEF
Writing' from 117 Warren RcL, Marrick-
ville, New South. Wales, Miss Beryl
Wallace says:—“ I suffered so badly with
pains in my joints that I was compelled
to give up my work and for nine weeks I
remained at home, in terrible pain all the
time. Finally, I got a box of De Witt’s
Pills from the chemist, and by the time I
had taken six of the pills my pain had
gone. I can honestly recommend De
Witt’s Pills to anyone."
NEVER IN BETTER HEALTH ,
Mrs. Dorothy M. Rentel, “Riverlea,”
Glen Forbes, Gippsland, Victoria, says:—
“For six years I suffered very badly
from headaches, dizziness, and kidney
trouble. I tried many prescriptions but
could get no relief. I saw an advertise-
ment about DeWitt’s Kidney andßladder
Pills and decided to try them. I have
been taking- them for some little while,
and I have never been in better health in
all my married life.”

branches and bark, carried on the gale,
were spreading the fire behind him. Even
as he looked another flame rose, whirling and
twisting like a waterspout, and licked the
tree-tops.
Harmer found himself running desperately,
half-lifting Lizzie, whom he had overtaken.
As he reached the group of fighting pygmies,
giving way desperately before a growing wall
of flame, another lurid bonfire began further
in their rear. Clearly they could not hope
to withstand the fire in this dense scrub, and
against such a wind. “Back to the store!”
he shouted, and began to run again. Although
his words were not heard his intention was
clearly understood, and men and women and
a few children who had defied their parents
ran urgently and breathlessly towards the
settlement.
Henry’s store was the nearest of the dozen
or so buildings which, grouped about a little
clearing perhaps a hundred yards across, had
attached themselves to the sawmill on whicn
they depended for existence. Before the
store the men worked feverishly to clear away
by fire and axe the scrub and trees which
had been allowed to grow up near the build-
ing. Women rushed into the dwelling at
the rear, and under Lizzie’s guidance began
carrying out the more portable possessions,
depositing them , in a heap in the middle of
the dusty patch, which corresponded to a
street, but which was, except for under-
growth, as densely timbered as the forest.
But the fire gave them no time. It raged
over the slight rise and whooped down upon
the doomed houses. Men fought desperately ;
women ran with buckets of water from the
house rain-tanks and flung the water over
men and walls alike. In five minutes the
store was burning furiously and the next
house was wreathed in a, red . creeper.
A sudden cry went up, “The Mill!”
The mill was seen to be burning busily
at one corner, set alight by flying branches.
A young woman holding a baby began to
scream hysterically and showed a tendency
to run blindly into the flame.
“Here, Lizzie, look after this woman!”
called Harmer, dragging the girl back from
the burning house. “Who is she?”
“Oh, Tom, I forgot to tell you. She s
Sian’s wife. They took the house next to us.”
“Stan!”
Harmer’s thin face, blackened by smoke
and sweat, and working with exhaustion,
could express nothing, but Lizzie sensed
some terrible anger in him.
She was about to make some attempt to
pacify him, but suddenly pointed rigidly like
one confronted by lions.
Others followed her glance; they screamed,
their voices almost inaudible in the temfy-
ing pandemonium. They too pointed, and
began to run —-they did not know where.
Men took up the cry. The north wind, swirl-
ing in that confined valley, had swung the
fire around the settlement and was ringing
tiie little dust patch with fire!
Harmer thought quickly. In five minutes
or less the place where they stood would
be swept by fire. They must get away; but
where?
Groups of men and women dashed towards
the track across which streamed a red cur-
tain of fire. Others, eyes fixed with terror,
crouched in the dust, unable in their fear
to do anything. An enormous draught sucked
at their clothing and swirled the dust about
them.
Snatching the baby from his sister-in-
law’s arms, and grasping her under the
armpit, Harmer began to run, shouting to
Lizzie, “The creek, the creek!”
The scrub was burning slowly—in one
minute it would be an impassable wall of
fire. Through this he dragged the screaming
and terrified girl who, born on the plains,
had never before seen forest like this, let
alone a forest on fire. Her dress flared and
blazed. Handicapped by the baby, he en-
deavored with his free hand to smother the
flame. Instead of helping, she ran from him.
Darting at the girl, he threw her down, and
with his free hand rolled her over until the
flame was extinguished. Then, jerking her
to her feet, he screamed “Run, damn you!”
But she had fainted. With his arm round
her waist he carried her then over his hip,
stumbling blindly through the smoke and
small flames towards a rocky outcrop in the
hollow.
Although the creek was dry at this time of
the year, there was hope of a pool. On the
existence of this pool he gambled. Ten
feet across and perhaps five feet deep the
rocky hollow still held about four feet of
water. Into it Harmer jumped with his
heavy burden. Lizzie, after a slight hesitation,
followed and stood beside him, panting with
fear, exhaustion and horror.
Breast-deep in water, they looked back
the way they had come. A red turmoil of
flame ten or twelve feet high hid the town-
ship, but the tall trees that stood in the
street could be seen burning furiously.
Suddenly Lizzie shuddered and shrieked
“Tom, the horses!” Above the roar of the
fire they heard the high scream of agony
from the stalls at the mill. A terrifying
shape, mane and tail and coat blazing, dashed
out of the smoke, ran into a burning tree
and collapsed. The tree, already weakened,
swayed and fell with a smothering crash.
The scrubby growth around the pool was
crackling fiercely, the smoke made breathing
painful; the heat was almost unendurable.
“I wonder where the others got to," said
Lizzie in the voice of one who doubts the
reality of her surroundings.
“Up the track, I expect,” replied Harmer,
knowing well the impossibility of it. He
handed her the baby, then puiled her down
in the water until only her head remained
clear. “Keep under,” he commanded.
He had seen what she must not see—
what had been a man, blundering like a
walking torch through the furnace on the
edge of the township two hundred yards
away. Impossible to reach it, nor could
anything have been done for it, yet Harmer,
still standing and tingling with horror, re-
sisted with all his might a craving to dash
through those red, snarling, leaping flames
to the rescue of his fellow-animal. As he
watched, the flames dragged the thing down,
where it writhed awhile and became still.
A piercing yell at his ear aroused him.
The girl was struggling and staring, and
with wide open mouth screamed without
ceasing. Opening her eyes from the faint,
she had seen as in a nightmare that dread-
ful end. Its fall had converted the night-
mare into a reality, and she had instantly
lost her reason.
Harmer struggled with her; but she showed
a strength greater than his. He missed his
footing and went under, instinctively releas-
ing her. She struggled to the edge and
ran screaming away from that awful sight.
The flames licked at her; the smoke swal-
lowed her.
Spluttering to the surface, Harmer
gasped, “Where is she?”
Lizzie wept in helpless, silent terror,
while the baby cried lustily.
Guessing what had happened, he scrambled
out of the pool and, cursing unmeaningly,
ran into the smoke, where he stood a moment
choking and trying to think. He could hear
nothing, see nothing, but the dreadful fur-
nace. The flames leapt at his face, so that
he hid it with his arms. They bit painfully
at his chest, arms and neck. He felt his
hair crackle as, beaten, he turned and groped
to the pool, and fell in. Two smouldering
strips remained of his shirt; the legs of
his trousers were gone; raw red flesh showed
on his arms and neck. The weight of a
betrayed trust bowed his spirit.
The great flame gathered to itself the
many minor flames and, whooping triumph-
antly, charged down on the pool, over it in
a screaming sheet, and up the hillside. Crouch-
ing, back and neck exposed, Harmer shielded
the baby in his arms. Over him and over
herself, Lizzie threw water continuously.
* * # *
Long after the flame had passed Tom
and Lizzie, breast-deep in the pool, gazed
unseeingly at red-hot desolation as they
rocked in turn a wet and hungry child.
In Epping Forest.
I have been walking in the woods,
My feet upon the leafy mould,
And felt that it was old —so old!
How long, how long since first I said:
“Some day beneath an English sky
I’ll tread
The piled-up forest mould,
And scoop it up and laugh and cry
To feel how old it is, how old!”
And, kneeling wild and lost, I’ll feel
(I, child of blazing southern suns)
An ancient comfort o’er me steal
That binds me to the gracious trees,
The darling trees, the Lovely Ones....
Ah, but I did not truly know
What ecstasy
Would come to me!
Just how the light green-gold would fall,
Clear honey-drops on leafy -wall,
And break like points of splintering glass
Upon each blade of sentient grass!
I did not know
How thick the bracken-shoots could grow,
Pale pewter in the sun ; nor how
The wind could arch each drooping bough !
I have been walking in the woods,
And once there came the cuckoo’s call!
I have been walking in the woods —
I have known all!

Constipation is the cause of most poor

the cause is constipation.
If you suspect this to be the cause of your

From Fremantle to Geelong
...from Melbourne to Cairns
GOODYEAR TYRES
are preferred
The survey which recorded the greater than 2 to 1
preference for Goodyear Tyres over any other make
*—was NATION WIDE in its scope.
From Fremantle to Geelong—from Melbourne to
Cairns, in varying percentages the votes received
from City and Country in every State overwhelm-
ingly favoured Goodyear Tyres. In some States the
preference for Goodyear was more than 50% —
greater than all Other makes combined—and the
average for the Commonwealth was 45.51%.
That more than 45% of Australian Motor Vehicle
Owners should prefer Goodyear Tyres is not sur-
prising to many leading Tyre Dealers throughout
Australia. These Dealers report that, in their ex-
perience, a far greater number of motorists prefer
Goodyear Tyres than any other make.
Many Motor Car and Truck Distributors also con-
firm the greater Public Preference for Goodyear
Tyres, stating that most new car or truck purchasers,
who specify a particular make of tyre, insist upon
having Goodyears.
The great multitude of Goodyear users have found
thgt by all standards, including price, their tyre
requirements are more _ met by Good-
years.

Tyres than on any other make.
