TUB TIDE RISES, THE TIDE FALLS.
The tide rises, the tide falls,
The twilight darkens, the curlew calls ;
Alontr the sea-sands damp and brown
The traveller hastens toward the town,
And the tide rises, the tide falls.
Darkness settles on roof and walls,
But the sea in darkness calls and calls :
The little waves, with their soft white hands,
Efface the footprints in the sands,
And the tide rises, the tide falls.
The morning breaks ; the steeds in their stalls
Stamp and neigh, as the hostler calls;
The day returns, but never more
Returns the traveller to the shore.
And the tide rises, the tide falls.
H. W. Longfellow.
I GUESS (said the hawker) I’ll go back to Eng-
land. After all, your Australia tires me.
No ; it doesn’t tire me, and I won’t go back,
but I’m tired of some of you Australians, and
,hat’s a fact. I’m just back from a trip out
ilVest —by train —first time I’ve been in a train
since Jack Robertson died. How that old man
could snort! Him and me was in a carriage
together, and but that isn’t what I was going
to tell you.
• • • »
You see, I don’t leave the cart onee in a blue
year ; but this time I had to. Business—which
must be attended to. And I renewed my
acquaintance, as you might call it, with the man
in the Australian train. He isn’t a pleasant
customer —by reason of the fact that he takes
his boots off. I don’t object to a sniff of any-
thing in moderation; but on that Bourke
line, where the windows have to be kept
closed to keep out the dust, there’s no deny-
ing it’s disagreeable. All sorts of mem
show you all sorts of socks—-or no socks. Those
big, pubhy fellows who don’t wear braces, and
whose pants are continually sliding along the edge
of decency—those are the worst. Makes me think
of the last stone I removed from a city horse’s
foot, days when I was oab-driving. Then those
long, tomato-oomplexioned gentlemen with sharp,
hide-bound features sprinkled with freckles the
size of a two-shilling bit—the gentlemen who sit
on the middle of their backbones, and smile mildly
from between their knees—they’re very likely to
lay aside the handkerohief-bundle which they
always carry in their lap, and take off a pair of
plain elastic-side cricket-bats, and Tobaoco
ib no use then.
• * * *
I dunno. Possibly your hard city streets, and
the tired tramp of feet aocustomed to swing in
stirrups, account for a lot of it. Anyhow, when
one of these bright Australians has hacked off a
pipe of Conqueror or Derby with a worn knife on
which are recorded specimens of all previous
plugs, and has by harsh agitation of his larynx
pumped up and ejected a quart or so of “dust-
lager,” then the bloke with his boots off is not
bad company. Of course I don’t mean the variety
whose conversation consists of expectoration and
“Yer”or “My oath,” but the fellow who
puts his feet up on the opposite seat and leans
back a bit with the stem of his pipe resting against
his tonsils. That’s the sort.
• * * »
“The ants must have to carry a swag in
this kinder country,” remarked one, as wo were
droning along near Nyngan. He didn’t address
anybody in particular. He was just the ordinary
casual sort of a man. A young fellow in a pair of
strapped pants and a battered shirt looked round
at him for a moment and remarked as he turned
to the window again:
“Seeivit worse.”
“O , give me the rivers,” said the
first.
“ What rivers ? ” asked the strapped one.
“Clarence; Richmond; Tweed—know every
brush on’em. What’s there here for a man?”—
pointing to the hazy plains. “ Why, I remember
when I was working for old Nogslen—- rum
he was, too. Thei% was two brothers of them,
Bill and Torn ; Bill was the bloke I logged for. If
he owed you fifty quid it was all the same.
Pay you all in-one-pound cheques.”
“ What’s logging? ”
“Logging? , cutting cedar. Great game.
Done now, though. Many's the time I’ve out out
a big heap of logs and got a bit of a fresh to float
’em down. That was Tuesday like. On the
Friday I’d have me ten or twenty quid to draw.
Hum -s, most of the coves up there was. Any
of ’em jiegged out, always have a cedar box, and
by w— no knots or seams in the planks
either. Mate of mine, old cove called Toni Ratlin,
used to do a lot of soring, you know one of them
s wot rips the logs up. Tom was ’cute, he
was, always took top, stood on top of the log.
poor down below dursn’t look up ; get Ins
eyes full of sawdust. Made a lot of stuff at
it, so what’s he do but Don’t know
anything much about ’em myself, b,ut ’Loin was a
bit of a judge, and thilPere one he gets was a bit
of a flyer. Used him rounding up the bn Hicks
had a Lot of hauling teams up there -for a while,
till some cove from up Cashier way conies and tells
Tom thfet some of the blokes from old Ogilvie’s
station and a lot of other coves had rigged
up a meet. I had a lot of logs in a brush and
couldn’t shift ’em till the fresh comes, so I tells
Tom when he tells me that he was going to enter
his moke that I’d gd up with him.
“Tom tucks the ola’orse up for a week or so
with a lot of corn —by —— it does grow easy up
there —and oil' we starts. We gets to Casiner about
ten o’clock at night and it was as dark as .
There was a couple of pubs there; it was a kinder
town, you see; so we goes around looking for a
stable and a place to doss. The first place was
chock-a-block, so we goes around to Murphy’s:
knew old Murphy—got squashed .between two
logs rafting down the river. His missus she kept
the pub. We gets a place for the horses, and Tom
was particular to lock the stable door. The house
was alright; but some of them station coves would
think nothin’ of rabbin’ soap on a horse’s teeth so
as he couldn’t eat, you see. Then we has a bit ter
eat, and some drinks with a lot of blokes from down
the river. All the station coves was skitin’ about
some - old cripple that was gorin’ ter win every
thing. Tom was gettin’ narked, so I tries to
get him to turn in. All the rooms tire missus she
says was full. We has a look round, anyway, and
in the first room near the verandah there was
this ’ere old Bill Nogslen first asleep. I goes
in ter have a bit of a lark with him. He was snor-
ing terrible hard, paralitic. We thinks awhile,
and then we collar’s hold of the bedclothes and
carries him in them out outer the verandah. Then
we gets onter the bed and goes ter sleep ;
Bight better than no bed, anyway.
“In the morning thebe was a of a
row. The old lady comes in and screams. Then
old Nogslen, with the blankets round him like a
darkie on Queen’s Birthday, comes in and howls,
‘What the are you doing in
my room ? ’
“Wo thought we was in a fix ; but Tom, cute
, he was up, and says, ‘ Why, Mr. Nogslen,
don’t you remember ? When we comes along the
verandah last night you shoves your head out of
the door, and says, ‘ What the hell are you
blokes doin’here?’ and we says, ‘Looking for a
bed.’ Then you says, ‘ Well, it’s too hot in
here. I’m goin’ to doss outside. You s can
have my bed. ’ ”
“ Old Nogslen looks sort of confused-like. It
was thin, now wasn’t it ? But he wasn’t a
bad sort. After a while he says, ‘ What are you
doing up here ? ’ So then Tom tells him, and he
says, ‘D’ye think that old hencoop of yours
can take down this town push ?’
“ Tom got nasty at that.
“ ‘ Take ’em down ? Why that horse I’ve got ’ll
run through that old hatstand of theirs like a
noo saw through a wet log.’
“ Then we had a drink. The races was all right,
I promise yer. ”
“How did that cove Tom’s horse do?” asked
the man in strapped pants.
“ Oh, he got licked. The other thing went
off in a cloud of - dust. Tom lost eighty quid.
But I know where there’s as good a brush as a
man could lay an axe on, and if ”
Just then we came to Byrock, and the strapped
man gathered up his bundle and got out.
I*• • *
I asked the cedar man what he thought of the
plain pine.
“What? This stuff that’s got such a
damned ram smell? No good. Short as a
caisrot. Full of knots as a swamp is of
snakes. Won’t carry a nail. Give me cedar.
There’s doors and things in Sydney made out of
logs that my old man put aboard the old “ School-
boy ” sixty year ago. Know old Yeager? Got
the Richmond trade pretty well all to hisself now.
But I know a brush, just up a bit of a gully ”
Then I fell asleep. Nice lot, aren’t you ? , Sound
enough, o’ course; but lacking in—lacking in—
what’s the blessed word I want ?
• • * *
So here I am back in Sydney—doing the lioi,o,
as you call it. 1 like lionising in Sydney—but
not among the grandees of Government House,
that shrine of a second-hand sceptre ; not among
the social orchids of Potts Point; not among the
heroes or d«dos of debate, who fill that oratorical
Noah’s Ark you call Parliament House. When I
lionise 1 like to get out of the beaten track, like a
saint in a harem, and look for the real lions.
+ „ * * *
Just inside the gates of vour beautiful Palace
Garden there are two marble lions, sitting like
sentinels to the pleasure-ground. Their heads are
raised, and they look upwards with unwinking
wonder. What are they gazing at ? The unicorn,
of course'.-—they an; looking for the unicorn.
Nearly all the other stone lions in the city have
unicorns to fight with ; but these Palace Garden
quadrupeds are left out in the cold. No
wonder they turn their disgusted backs to
tlie beauty of the Harbor. By the way,
the statues of the Apollo Belvidere and
the Venus de’ Medici, lower down in the
Gardens, also turn their backs ; and they at least
ought to know better, for they are not beasts.
But the Anglican Cathedral in George-street sets
a bad example, for it turns away from the princi-
pal street in the city.
* • • •
Then there is the majestic lion over the main
entrance to the Post-office in Martin’s Place; he
has a splendid unicorn to keep him company. A
proud lion this; his mane is a storm in stone, and
stiff enough to defy a whole regiment of curling-
tongs. He and his vis-a-vis suggest life and
action; unlike the lion and the unicorn on the top
of the Bank of New ZealantJ, over the way, across
George-sir&et. They are sitting down—loafing, in
fact.
• * * «
By the way, your Sydney loafer is like a rag in
fairyland ; he lives amid scenery fair enough to
make even a nuisance seem nice ; but lie remains
an incurable tatterdemalion, ugly as a nincom-
poop in a nightmare, and useless as a dummy egg
under a dummy hen. Mis financial position is
imposition ; he is as lazy as the dog that used to
lean its head against the wall to bark ; he drinks
as if he had been maiiufaitiired out of a piece of
parched desert ; his zeal in the search for cigar-
ends is unequalled ihe believes that .the pwblic
buildings of the city were erected for him to strike
‘ matches on ; he -smokes so much that I think he
prays to his pipe in secret, In short, he is not a
member of society, lint, an ember. W hat, in the
name of glory, is the community to do with him?
Observe how you deal with the loafer in Sydney.
He lies about iii the parks like a cursing cucumber
of humanity j perhaps resting himself after
numerous perambulations in search of food, for we
must remember that, if it is said that society
carries its charity too far, the vagabond to
walk after charity, a loiig, weary way. Or, may
be lie i« sleeping on the grass because he has been
out all through a cold, sleepless night. At any
rate, he has lost the power of will. It is no use
for social-reformers, like moralising cabbages of
stupidity, to talk of Will as if it were a clockwork
conundrum that could lie wound up inside a man s
head ; for, without going into the deadly dryness
of metaphysics, I may quote Professor Max
Mtil'ler to the effect that “in every language will
is a name for the state of some thing else ” ; it is a
state of mind, not a separate faculty. If the body
is unhealthy, the mind is unhealthy and cannot
function itself into that active state of foresight
called “will,” The loafer has sunk into a mental
torpor, and has little foresight beyond the nearest
meal, drink, or cigar-end. He has become a
machine with potential manhood.
**« « *
To cure this machine, society with its economics
and systems erects an immense Machine of charity.
What else can society do ? Personal alms-giving
has proved for ages as great a futility as trying to
slap shadows. Thus you tiave a big Machine of
impotent charity attempting to cure a small
machine of potential manhood, and the result is
failure. These are refrigerating times ; you freeze
the yheep for the foreign market, and chill human
sentiment for home philanthropies. The Austra-
lian character objects to becoming a pump of
pathos unless it is over something visible to the
senses, or vivid to the imagination. The homeless
population of Sydney .disgust alike the senses and
the imagination.
* * * *
Homeless I —sadder than a falling star is this
word. All round the world are human souls for
whom there is no welcome anywhere; they are
weary of being weary and alone; their sorrow is
like a hand stretched forth in the night to the
stars that are answerless. You have plenty of
them in Sydney, and yet one feels that life is brief
and should be beautiful, ami that to lessen the
trouble around us is the only effort that makes
existence not merely a leaf that falls in the moon-
shine. In preaching a gospel of Work, people are
apt to forget that all human effort is work. The
producer of luxuries works on the credulity of the
public ;so does the loafer. there is more effort
and worry on the part of the vagrant when he
walks five miles to collect six pennies, than on the
part of the producer of hair-dyes when he makes
six shillings. The loafer does Unseen Work; he
suffers that most cursed corrosion of life, mental
unrest and suspense as to where the next meal and
bed are coming from. The merchant works hard
at his desk, but the loafer works hard at hell in
the awful office of his mind.
**• * *
Yet where is the remedy ? There are three life-
lifting influences that may awaken these social
outcasts —religion, the love of woman, or self-
effort. As for religion, you might as well try to
evangelise an oyster or turn a brick into a prayer-
book. Then, with regard to the love of woman—
the loafer is too ugly. Who could have affection
for a being that looks like a refugee from a
Chamber of Horrors ? Yet women have cared for
his life and perhaps care for it now. He is
cursed with an uncontrollable ugliness; if he were
good-looking and well-dressed he would not be a
pauper. Again, it is futile to vaguely preach
“self-effort”; the vagrant might again ask—
“ What is will ? ” This question, if pushed to ulti-
mate definitions, makes one feel withered, like
a dead rose-leaf in a dictionary. Likewise,
it is useless to try and thrill him with
some generalised gospel of work, for he might
observe, with truth, that it would be much better
if half the world would knock off its present mode
of work. If you watch this rag republic of loafers
you will see that they themselves shadow forth the
remedy. They are lessons to the community, for
“ the charity of the poor to the poor is ideal.”
•They do each other good turns at a self-sacrifice.
The right remedy is for the rich individual to help
the poor individual; but this style of oharity has
been trampled to death for centuries.
* * * •
No, I’m a hawker, not a preacher; but you
make me preaoh. Why didn’t you let me talk
about the imaginative lions, instead of encourag-
ing me ro dogmatise about the realistic loafer ? It
is the old myth of the lion and the unicorn which
makes one feel how the beauty of imagination is
lost in this hair-brushing generation. The unicorn
symbolises the moon, with its two horns rolled
into one. The lion represents the sun, who fights
with the other animal for the crown of the heavens.
The combat is emblematic of the rising moon
following the declining sun ; when the moon sots
in her turn, she is supposed to stick her horn into
the tree of the underworld. Then the lion comes
up behind and devours the uniporn. Thus you
can see that the two marble lions in Palaee Garden
are quite correct in gazing up into the sky for the
unicorn.
* • » *
It js pleasant to wander in these beautiful palm
gardens by the sea, and muse over old myths. Of
old, in the days of amaranth and asphodel, the
world was rioh in romance. The sky was a
magnificent, overshadowing peacock’s tail ; the
earth was gorgeous beneath with lotus-blooms and
magic trees ; the unicorn came and laid its head
in the maiden’s lap, and allowed itself to be cap-
tured ; the rose was in love with the onion, and,
in the onion, with its concentric structure, the
ancient sage saw symbolised the mysteries of the
cosmos; the man'in the moon was banished to
that luminary for stealing cabbages ; lastly, ante-
diluvian men and women never had any doctors,
but, when their time, came, they just sneezed and
died. Beautiful romances of the past! Unfor-
tunately, you might as well expect a fit of hysterics
in a sardine-box as hope for any romance in these
days. „ ,
The General Post-office is one of the lions of
Sydney; there are more sculptured lions about
this building than about any other edifice in Austra-
lasia ; it is a lion of lions. By day, when crowds of
people swarm around it to post their letters, one
might imagine it to be- some grandiose monster,
with clockwork eyes, which requires to be con-
stantly fed on paper. What letters come and go
in tlie course of a year ! 'l’ruly, in this life the
ink-well is more powerful than the water-well, but
the farewell of man and woman is the most power-
ful of ail. Farewell!—that just reminds me-
EVENING SONG.
Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands,
And mark the meeting of the sun and sea.
How long they kiss in sight of all the lands,
Ah ! longer, longer, we.
Now in the sea’s red vintage melts the sun,
As Egypt’s pearl dissolved in r«wy wine,
And Cleopatra night drinks all. 'Tis done.
Love, lay Urine hand in mine.
Oome forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven’s heart;
Glimmer ye waves, round else unlighted sands.
O night! divorce our sun and sky apart,
Never our lips, our hands.
S. Lanior.
THE SILENCE OF LOVE.
Oh, inexpressible as sweet,
Love takes my voice away;
I cannot tell thee when we meet
What most I long to say.
But hadat thou hearing in thy heart
To know what beats in mine,
Then shouldst thou walk, where'er thou art
In melodies divine.
So warbling birds lift higher notes
Than to our hearts belong ;
The music Alls their throbbing throats,
But silence steals the song.
G. E. Woodberry.

HEADACHE
i CURED!
S 3
A Headache Cure should be
instautaueous, safe, certain,
and effective, however often
it is used, and free from dan-
ger of evil after-effects. The
public should know that some
so-called headache cures are
dangerous, and ought not to
be used except under medical
advice. A headache cure, free
from every objection, is ob-
tainable, and known as
BISHOP’S
Citrate of Caffeine
It immediately cures the
worst headache, and dispels
all feelings of exhaustion and
weariness. Supplied by all

ATTENTION, PLEASE!
WHY are the Preparations manufactured by E, HOL-
* ' LAND, Hair Specialist, superior to and in greater de-
mand than all other Preparations for promoting: the growth
and restoring the color to the Hair ? Because they are the
result of a practical knowledge—2o years’ experience—of all
the Diseases of the Hair, and what is necessary to remove
them. Whereas nearly all other preparations are manufac-
tured by quacks, and are nothing but quack nostrums.
( A gentleman in writing says : —“ Everywhere Igo I hear
; people speaking highly of your Preparations for the Hair.”
Another gentleman says :—“ By a mere chance I have had
a good opportunity of witnessing the good effect of your now
well-known Hair Restorer. A friend of mine since boyhood
was quite bald on top of head, and, to my knowledge, tried most things mentioned without any result. A few months
ago he informed me he was intending to give your Restorer a trial. Of course I laughed, and few which you must for-
give me. I did not see my friend again until a few days ago, and, if you can, judge my surprise on finding my old com-
rade, not with a bald head, but with a full, thick head of hair.”—P. J. CONNORS, Esq., Toomn, N.S.W. 20 9 97.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Patrick McDonald O’Day.
I’ve grafted for Irishmen ; Scotchmen ; for
Britishers, Germans and Danes ;
I’ve bullocked for men without mercy, and sweated
for men without brains ;
I’ve labored from “jackass to jackass,” and
pottered when Jack was asleep,
Cutting chaff by the light of the candle, or helping
to slaughter a sheep ;
And a notion I nourished that cookies existed to
cultivate greed
With the oats, and the Vvheat and the barley—l
hated the conscienceless breed !
I cursed the conditions that forced me to grind out
my heart in this way,
Till I struck a back-country selector, named
Patrick McDonald O’Day.
He wallops no tin in the morning ; he rattles no
stones on the roof,
Gives no “Pig-pig,” or “ Woh, Blossom,” warning,
or dog-undeserving reproof.
He simply walks into the hut, and he says that
“’tis seven o’clock,
And it might be as well to be movin’—have
breakfast, and water the stock.
Then across to Malone's for the binder; “they
are sure to be doneVith it now ;
In fact, if they’re not, bring it over—l want it
meself, anyhow.
And ask for the loan of a swingle, and if they’re
not using the dray
They might lend it perhaps for a fortnight to
Patrick M‘Donald O’Day.”
His oaths run from “ blow it ” and “ blanky ” ; a
wide and a wonderful range ;
Disjointed, ambitious, or cranky, or muffled and
moving and strange.
When money is wanted he has none, but borrows
some down at the store.
‘That’s more than you owe me.” “O dammit,
what matters a bob or two more ! ”
"The haystacks want fencing, but, hang it, the
) ground is too thundering hard ;
I’ll wait till a good fall of rain comes, and stick
up a double-rail yard.”
He never does things to the letter; he’s careless
and foolish, they say.
Well, I know that worse men manage better than
Patrick M'Donald O’Day.
The bailiffs are now in possession, and Patrick’s
away at a ball,
And the look of things leaves the impression he’s
somehow arrived at the “ wall.”
He paid me last night what hepwed me ; right up
and a half a “ quid ” more;
But I guessed by the queer way he did it ill-luck
had sat down on him sore.
I thought I’d no sympathy handy to waste on a
cocky gone smash ;
But this affair wallops me bandy and prompts me
to deeds that are rash.
I ma,y pad along paths that are brighter or trudge
it on tracks that are gray,
But I’ll never strike man that is whiter than
Patrick M‘Donald O’Day. —Ben Sun, Vie.
The “ Tea-Fight ” at Hogan’s Hill.
When Prator came to Hogan’s Hill the people had
an awful name
For manners and for morals ill and deeds of law-
lessness and shame;
The decalogue they all transgressed, and drank,
and lied, and fought with glee ;
Of piety they made a jest,
And gambled on the day of rfet— w
In short, it was a pagan nest of godless, taw
iniquifec.
But Prator was a holy man. He took his Bible
in his hand,
And preached from mullock-tips, and ran a rous-
ing mission through the land.
And soon he had a class complete—hard-fisted
saints, but full of grace—
To follow him like sheep, and bleat
A plaintive echo, and entreat
Their mates to seek the humble seat, and shun the
Devil’s dismal place.
And so, a building-fund to raise, a “ tea-fight ”
was arranged at last;
The term occasioned much amaze from Hogan’s
Hill to Damanblast,
And at The Bar and Cattle Run, where Moody’s
boys remembered still
The friendly battles fought and won,
And held it a disgrace to shun
A chance of waging war for fun or devilment at
Hogan’s Hill.
The tickets sold in splendid style; an eager con-
course filled the place ;
They listened with impatience while the Brother
spoke a weary grace,
And then they fell upon the cake, and washed it
down with weakest tea ;
But little interest did they take
In buns and such ; they sat awake
For signs of war. Each eye bespake a valorous
expectance.
At length the Marble Man took heart. Says he,
“You boys are mighty slow,
So here’s to give the thing a start! ” He fetched
young Donaghy a blow
That put a half-hitch in his nose and drew the
claret in a stream.
Then Sullivan and Jones arose,
And bellowed : “ Boys, select your foes ! ”
And at it went the men in rows amongst the
scattered tarts and cream.
They fought on end and on the flat, a fight
unanimous and free;
They spread the butter by the pat, and wallowed
in the floods of tea ;
And Prator preached with upraised hands, and
bade the shocking strife to cease,
And on the floor his new'-plucked brands,
All disregarding his commands,
Were plugging at the rival bands for sake of
brotherhood and peace t
The heroes fought; and buttered bread, and sand-
wiches, and battered pies,
And cream, and cake about them spread, and
tarts were spattered in their eyes ;
And when of blows and picnic stuff the com-
batants h.-td got their fill,
Tim Moody and the Burly Rough
Called off the fight. ’Twas easy.bluff—
They know when they have had enough at ‘Cattle
Run and Hogan’s Hill !
It was-The Rough who then upreaced to move a
vote of thanks. There were
Two penny custards in his beard, a pound of butter
in his hair.
He said he merely wished to state the thing had
~gone off.pleasantfec ;
He thanked the elders for the f4te,
And added, with a smile sedate :
" Best make it whisky next time, mate. It’s multv
stuff to fight on—tea ! ”

Gentlemen.—You ask us what we think of your P & B Roofing, and, in reply, we would
say that at first we were very sceptical about it, and very cautiously commenced using it by
ordering a small quantity for our cupola top-house, which is, perhaps, tne most severe place
in which it could be used. We were so v eil pleased with it there that we have ordered more
of it from time to time, until we now have fully five (6) acres of roof covered with it. We not
only use it for ourselves, but we take a great deal of pleasure in recommending it to anyone
who desires to be put on the track of a good thing. Yours truly,

The present loudest groan of the N.S.W. parochial gang is that tho Federal Parliament is to meet in Melbourne to choose the Federal city (in N.S.W.), and that it may
Federal city but simply go on meeting in Melbourne for ever, thereby making it the capital after all. This, like most of the other possibilities, is based on the assumption that all the peoples of
Australia, save only the pure and noble Cornstalk, are rogues and swindlers, which is rather interesting from the only province whoso Parliament delibetely broke faith over the Federal
compact.

SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1899.
Dickson to the People of Queensland.
Queensland has a general election next
month, and Premier Dickson —Dreary Dick-
son, the hairless Brisbane house-agent—has
issued his manifesto to the people of the Pie-
bald Country. Dickson is boss of a Ministry
which has now lasted for nine years
under five different heads. Griffith and
MTlwratth bossed it jointly at first, and
sunk their long enmity on the front Trea-
sury bench. Then Griffith raised the
salary attached to the Chief-Judgeship (out
of which Lilley had been harried after he
made unpleasant remarks in a case wherein
MTlwraith was one of the defendants), and
appointed himself to the billet, and
MTlwraith reigned alone for a few months
till illness, and possibly the Queensland
N. Bank stench, drove him away to Europe,
where he still remains. Opposition-leader
Nelson obligingly stepped over, and bossed
the Ministry for a while—till he grew tired,
and also appointed himself to a comfortable
life-billet. Then Byrnes ran the same old
Ministry ; the question lay between him and
Tozer, so they divided the loot, Tozkr
getting the Agent-Generalship and Byrnes
the Premiership. Byrnes was the most
promising of the gang, but after he had made
a gorgeous royal progress through the coun-
try, and promised everybody the globe, he
died. Then solemn, heavy-going James
Dickson inherited the job and the profit,
and solemn James appeals to the people of
Queensland to rise up next month and give
him a 'three years’ grazing lease of his fat
pasture.
• • • *
He issues a colorless manifesto—the most
absolutely colorless that any Australian Pre-
mier has issued for very many yoars—always
excepting Backdown Patterson’s last literary
effort, the one which cost him his .billet and
made plain brown Turner head of the Vic-
torian Government. Dickson states at groat
length, and in many turgid polysyllables, that
he is moderately in favor of Federation pro-
vided it isn’t carried to excess, and will move
in the matter gradually. And, to do him
justice, he seems as enthusiastic and as
earnest on the question as a sodden person
of his calibre can be about anything. He
proposes to borrow the money and build a
tremendous railway north and south to con-
nect the three great lines which strike out
west from Brisbane, Rockhampton and
Townsville respectively. Borrowing money
and building railways are the Continuous
Ministry’s panacea for everything, and as this
stupendous line may be situate in the east or
west or middle of the province, or between
the east and middle, or between the middle
and west, it is liable to go through the back-
yard of anybody over three-quarters of
Queensland. The prospect of another vast
scramble for the loan-money will do a lot to
keep the electors solid for Dreary Dickson
and his gang. And, in addition to this,
Dickson is in favor of borrowing the money
to construct a whole lot of “light agricul-
tural lines,” districts not specified, so any-
body in all Queensland may hope for another
railway through his back-yard. He also
promises that, while borrowing and “ blew-
ing ” all these millions on top of what is
already, in proportion to population, the
Biggest Debt on Earth, he will practise
severe economy, and won’t increase taxation,
and will reduce the interest charged on loans
to local bodies. Even the dullest auctioneer
can hardly do more all at once than reduce
interest, and not increase taxation, and bor-
row seven or eight millions, and practise the
strictest economy.
• • * •
And, in addition to this, Dickson pro-
mises to resume assisted immigration, in
order that the demand for labor may always
exceed the supply. In other words, there
being already more workers than can find
employment, he is i J introduce still
more workers, so that there may be abund-
ance of employment for all of them. He
proposes to establish a University at Bris-
bane, and he speaks disrespectfully of the
tick and the prickly-pear. And this is
Dickson on alien immigration :
Upon the most, important question of colored and alien
labor I desire to speak with no uncertain sound, and my
policy will be to excl-ude all those races whose introduc-
tion is not already sanctioned and regulated by law.
At present the Chinaman, the Jap, and the
Kanaka, who form the great bulk of the
aliens, are all more or less regulated by law,
and the Hindoo comes in as a British sub-
ject ; but with regard to the one or two
fragmentary tribes (including the Esqui-
maux) who don’t matter, Dickson intends
to be a holy terror, and he says he won’t
“ hesitate to propose to Parliament any
measures of restriction or even exclusion
which may be necessary.” So Dickson isn’t
necessarily going in for exclusion after all,
but may only go in for “ restriction
amount of restriction not defined, so it may
boil down to a cast-iron law that no ship
shall bring in more niggers of all sorts than
it can conveniently carry.
* * • • .
And here again is Dickson on a State
Land Bank :
The ordinary channels of banking and other financial
institutions supply ready means of borrowing at a low
rate of interest to the possessor of freehold security.
There are, however, many agriculturists who do not
possess such security, and for these I propose fo consider
means by which they may obtain the needful advances at
a rate not in excess of that paid by their more fortunately
situated brethren.
In other words, Dickson “ proposes to con-
sider ” means of lending money to the
people with doubtful security only, so that
the good securities may go to the Q.N. Bank
as heretofore.
• • • •
In addition to all this Byrnes’s successor
proposes to enlarge and improve Queens-
land’s harbors with borrowed money ; and
to borrow the money to erect a large number
of public buildings, unspecified, at all manner
of places not definitely mentioned. So in the
absence of detail almost everybody in
Queensland will have hopes that he may sell
his allotment to the Government to put an
important public building on. He is in
favor of cheaper postage, but doesn’t see
how it is'to he brought about ; and thinks
that Queensland should, “ from time to
time,” make additions to its defences. He
believes in the early-closing system and the
weekly half-holiday, but “prefers to see the
public acting voluntarily on lines of humanity
and mutual consideration.” So he doesn’t
intend to do anything. And, having thus
smacked all the abstract virtues on the back,
Dickson comes to a long-winded conclusion.
He isn’t going to widen the franchise, or
establish direct taxation, or definitely shut
out aliens and cheap nigger-labor, or
definitely start the State Land Bank, or
shorter working hours, or try to lighten
the stupendous debt-burden, or improve
sanitation, or reform the Upper House, or
do anything clear and absolute among the
million things that so badly want doing. But
he is going to borrow an awful lot of money
to build railways through the properties of
his supporters, and the tones of severe re-
proof in which he speaks of the tick are cal-
culated to make that insect retire in confu-
sion and repent of its many sins.
• » • *
A capable Opposition with a capable
leader should be able to rout this dull,
fatherly man of copy-book platitudes with
such slaughter that he would never be seen
or heard of again. He is an opponent that.
Section, or Turner, or Kingston, or Isaac
Isaacs, or Big John M‘lyenzie, or even such
politicians as Rettv Oarrotiiers, Cacman
Fysh, Holder, Maorilund’s much-damaged
ex-Treasurer Ward, Higcjins, or Copeland
could brush away like the aged blow fly of
autumn. The only Minister outside Queens-
land who looks his equal in utter flabbiness
is the holy Brunker. And yet it seems as if
Dickson might get through, though it is
hardly likely that the Continuous Ministry
will ever again be quite its old self. The
trouble with the Queensland Labor-party, as
with every other is that it is too
exclusively a Labor-party. The public knows
what it means to do for the manual workers
if it gets a chance, but the public
also wants to know what it is going to
do for other classes of the community. It
wants to know how Glassey proposes to act
about the finances if he gets on top ; about
Civil Service reform; what economies or
savings he can suggest; if he can offer a
feasible public debt conversion scheme which
will save the country money at Bull’s ex-
pense ; what cash he proposes to borrow ;
what railways he thinks of building and
through whose back yard ; if he has any
scheme for reducing railway freights ; if he
can reduce postage and yet make the post-
office pay ; if he is going to irrigate, and
where, and how cheaply ; if he can reduce
the cost of law proceedings ; and all manner
of other things.
Constant adhesion to the 40-plank plat-
form has created a Vague, ignoraftt im-
{iression that a Labor Premier Would
et the finances and everything else slide
while he legislated for shearers only. The
average Labor leader is the only person who
asks the country to put him at the head of
affairs without explaining what he is going
to do with the interests that are not exclu-
sively those of his own horny-handed crowd.
He has no definite tariff, as a rule, or he
doesn’t show it, and no com pie* >olicy.
And the 40-plank platform is apparently a
grievous mistake. If the Ballance-Seddon
party had appealed to Maoriland in ’9O
with a programme containing all the
things it has done since then, the chances
are that it would have been rejected as a
wild revolutionist. By doing one thing at
a time it educated the country as it went
along, and the semi-Labor Ministry of
Maoriland has now proved that almost every
one of its ideas was perfectly feasible. If
the Queensland Labor-leader would leave 34
of his planks in the shed, and put only half-
a-dozen to the front for immediate use, and
fill in the rest of the space with a scheme of
honest finance, a decent public-works policy,
and general law-reform, he ought to scatter
Dickson to the four winds. And the rest of
the planks could be brought out one at a
time, when the country had found that the
first half-dozen had nothing fatal about
them. But no country, after a long spell of
timid Toryism, is likely to take 40 planks
all at once.
The Lamentable Coal Trade.
Last year (1898) the province of New South
Wales raised 4,706,251 tons of coal, valued at
.£1,271,832, or about ss. sd. per ton. It was
the largest coal output on the province’s record.
Also, it was the lowest price on record, and, in
correspondence with the price, wages were at
a low and most miserable figure. Fifteen
years ago N.S. W. got more money for not much
more than half the coal, and in those days
wages were better, and dividends were better,
and the country wasn’t any worse, and a large
section of the workers, who have now sunk into
abject and hopeless poverty, were then able
to live in reasonable comfort. The steady
downfall of the N.S.W. coal industry is shown
in the following statement of quantities and
prices :
And on this subject Tjfie Bulletin desires to
say something about the minimum-wage, and
the alleged law of supply and demand, and
various other things.
• • 9 *
Australia is an enormous country, and will
one day hold a vast population—how vast it is
Uifficult to say, for the apparent tendency of
population is to increase till the world can find
subsistence for no more people, and where the
exact limit of subsistence is no one really
knows. It is a country that is none too
well timbered, and the well-timbered regions
are also the well-watered regions, which will
be badly wanted later on for agricultural pur-
poses. Australia, to all appearance, must de-
pend largely on its coal supplies to cook the
daily chop and run the industries of its future
hundred million or so of inhabitants till
that highly indefinite period when man
learns to dispense with fuel. It has very
little water-power, therefore it is even more
dependent on its coal supplies than most
countries. And considering the size of the
country, and the population it is capable (de-
spite its barren soil and droughty atmosphere)
of carrying, and the extent of the possible ages
that lie ahead, the known coal supply of Aus-
tralia isn’t so very extensive. And there will
never, so far as geologists know, be another
pound of coal created while this world lasts
and remains a habitable globe. Therefore when
N.S.W. exports 1,400,000 tons of coal perl
mim to countries beyond Australia it is selling
its capital the capital that can never be re-
placed, and which may be very badly wanted
by-and-by—to aliens at a rale which pays neither
the mine-owner, nor the miner, hor the country
at large. J
* * * *
There are more conl-tnines working in N.S. W.
than the present demand justifies—but then the
law of supply and demand isn’t supposed to
apply to the owner, and it isn’t customary to
curse him for trangressing that law by start-
ing more enterprises than the case calls
for. There is more coal produced than is
actually wanted, and N.S.W. can’t throw its
invaluable capital abroad fast enough. The
price keeps getting lower in consequence, and
the wage-rate is lowered faster than the price,
therefore the 10,000 Cornstalk citizens who live
by this industry, and their 30,000 or 40,000
dependents, have been gradually sunk into a
state of miserable poverty. When any large
section of the community is reduced to practical
penury, it is bad for the future physical quality
of the race; bad for its moral character, for
poverty is the father of ignorahce and savagery •
and bad for trade and industry, for the im-
poverished sectioh has little money to spend
And N.S.W. is creating an abjectly and hope-
lessly impoverished class ih its midst, largely in
order that the Chinaman, and the Chilian, and
the Californian, and other foreigners may get at
a cheaper and still cheaper rate, through the
frantic competition of mine-owners, the coal
which Australia may want very badly some
day for its own use. And N.S.W. indirectly
subsidises the trade out of revenue into the
bargain. Newcastle and Wollongong, the two
great coal ports, are exempt from wharfage
duties. It is estimated that a duty of from
3d. to 6d. per ton is required to pay inte-
rest on the cost of necessary harbor
works and to keep them in repair, and at
all other ports this duty is charged. But as
regards these two ports the cost is’charged to
the community at large, and the country pays
indirectly a subsidy of 3d. on every ton of coal
which is shipped abroad at starvation rates, so
that the Californian and Chow and Chilian may
get their coal even cheaper than they otherwise
would 1 ,
• • • *
Just now the eternal difficulty between the
mine-owners and the miners is on once more,
and a further reduction of the present miser-
able wage is threatened. And for the sake of
the future race of Australians, or that part of
it which is likely to grow up thin and lank and
weedy and splay-footed in the hovels of the
coal-mining districts, The Bulletin reckons
that it is time for the State to interfere. What
it proposes is that there should be a minimum
hewing-rate of at least 4s. 2d. per ton (the
Newcastle rate in 1890—the miners’ great am-
bition now is to prevent it dropping below 3s.
2d., and it has been down to 2s. lid., with
possibilities of a further fall). The fact that
this w’ould be an interference with the alleged
law of demand and supply is too obvious to re-
quire arguing, but the miserable old law doesn’t
matter a straw' in any case. It is always being
faked by combinations to cut down wages or to
put up prices, and it has never had a fair show
this century, anyhow, so a litlle more interfer-
ence won’t hurt it. And the exigencies of the
State are of more importance than any alleged
economic law. The matter isn’t merely one
between masters and men, or between the law'
of demand and supply and the men, or between
the men and the masters and the people who
send coal away in coffin-ships. Thje State is a
party to the deal, and it is the State’s business
to look after its interests therein. Every man
and woman and child in the country is in some
measure the property of the State. They are
the property of the State to defend the country
if need be ; to reproduce a race which will be
able to defend the country in its turn ; to in-
crease its population so as to make it stronger
and better able to hold its place among nations;
to keep up its intellectual standard so that it
won’t become a mere unintellectual Gibeonite
among the world’s progressive communities.
And the bosses who pay to a large section of
the community such abjectly miserable wages
that they can’t keep up to a decent standard of
living are damaging the State’s property just
as much as if they fired a cwt. of dynamite
under the Treasury. That is where the State’s
absolute right to interfere comeß in.
• * # *
Of course higher wages mean higher coal
prices, and higher coal prices may mean the
destruction of a part of the export trade. If
so, that part of the export trade ought to go.
It is mostly carried on in foreign ships manned
bv foreign crews. It consists in New South
Wales keeping a very large section of the com-
munity in extreme poverty, and throwing away
an irreplaceable national assest for next to
nothing, all in order that the Chilian and the
Californian may have cheap coal, and that the
province may brag about the multitude of ships
which go in and out of its harbors every year.
It isn’t worth while to starve our own people
that the Chilian or Californian, who are nothing
to us, may get cheap coal, or in order that the
Foreign - trade papers may brag once a
year about the amount of foreign ship-
ping in Cornstalk harbors. These things are
not bread neither are they cheese, nor
even tanglefoot. The minimum wage would
also make coal dearer in Australia—and this
paper doesn’t see why it shouldn’t ; no decent
community wants to get anything so cheap
that the producer of it can’t live by his toil as
a white man should live ; cheapness carried to
that extent is a curse and a disease. Also, it
might reduce the output for a time, until
things adjusted themselves to the new con-
ditions, though this is by no means cer-
tain. If it did reduce the output it would
also reduce employment for a time. That
is to say there would possibly be work
for 9000 miners instead of 10,000, and (hough
the 9000 might get much more wages than the
10,000 received, still the State would have a
large contract in dealing with the surplus until
they were shunted off by slow degrees into
other branches of industry—especially con-
sidering how very few new branches of indus-
try the Foreign-trade system provides. Still,


N.S. W. absorbs more than that number of male
immigrants every year, so apparently the ab-
sorbing process is not impossible. And it is a
difficulty which must be faced some day, else
the ever-diminishing wage-rate will ultimately
reduce the N.S.W. miner to the level of a
semi-savage and a slave, and make him a fine
sample of national degradation and a danger to
the community.
* * • *
With a compulsory increase of wages would
come the inevitable combination to raise the
price of coal. No doubt an extra Is. or so per
ton added to the hewing rate would make an
increase necessary—only if the owners are left
to themselves it is probable the increase in
price and the increase in wages won’t bear the
slightest resemblance to each other. But if the
coal-owners’ “combine” carried the process
too far, and its own beloved law of supply and
demand didn’t furnish the needful remedy, the
probable result would be that the State would
have to become its own coal-owner. Mean-
while, in suggesting a legal minimum wage
of 4s. 2d. The Bulletin isn’t asking much.
It merely proposes that the wage should be
increased Is., and leaves the owner to pass
the extra charge on to his customers. It
is no more of an outrage on commercial prin-
ciples that the industry should be burdened by
a fixed wage than that it should be burdened by
a fixed royalty, or ground rent, or a fixed rate
of interest on money borrowed from debenture-
holders. And it is merely a reversion to a rate
which proved quite workable eight years ago.
Since then prices have gone down because
owners in their greed chose to ruin themselves
by tearing more coal out of the ground than
there was a demand for, and forcing it
into the glutted markets of the world at any
price it would fetch. They almost doubled the
production in a few years without waiting for
any corresponding increase of customers —in
other words, they committed sacrilege against
their own sacred joss, the law of supply and
demand. The establishment of a minimum
wage would set up a new set of conditions, and
it would probably take a little time for things
to adjust themselves to it. But they would
adjust themselves very shortly. The power of
adjustment possessed by things in general is
quite remarkable.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Bone-Grindi n g Monopoly.
Melbourne Tramway Directors have at length
replied to Premier Turner’s request that they
should consider the feasibility of reducing the
hours of their employes. They publish a long
and wearisome letter setting forth vaguely and
indirectly the virtues of the monopolistic co.,
and insisting strenuously that it hasn’t treated
its employes as badly as it might have
done. Also it winds up, after throwing out a
gentle hint as to further concessions, by refus-
ing to shift, either in the matter of hours of
labor or of instituting penny sections. As
to the latter “ concession,” where sectional
fares have been tried they have proved profit-
able ; they are customary in nearly all other
parts of the world ; and—most suggestive—the
co. declines to test the matter by instituting
them on any one line for three or six months
and publishing a sort of balance-sheet of the
result. It simply says they wouldn’t pay ; the
experience of other cities proves the contrary.
As to the hours of labor, section 62 of the
original Tramways Act, ’B3, added toby sundry
small Acts, and finally amended in ’B7, lays
down the law quite clearly and distinctly.
The exact wording of the section is :
The days of labor of any person employed by the com-
pany either as a driver or conductor of any tramcar, or
of the animals working any tramcar, shall be eiffht hours,
but any person so employed may work for the company
overtime for special payment, provided that no person so
employed shall in any case work for the company more
than 60 hours in any one week, and the company shall be
liable to a penalty of five pounds for each and every
breach of this section.
Notice “shall be eight hours” and “ may work
overtime for special payment.” Yet the co.
works all its employes the full period of 60
hours at the ordinary rate —from Bd. to 9d. per
hour; there is no “ special payment for over-
time ” ; there is not, nor ever has been, any
such thing as “overtime” in this company’s
service among these classes of employes. “No
man is permitted to work more than 60
hours per week if the co. can possibly
avoid it.” What, then, becomes of the eight
hours per day ? Where does it come in ?
The co.’s secretary, in his letter to the Premier,
asserts largely about the hours being longer in
some British cities and the wages lower, but
he says no word as to the ruling rate of wages
in those places, nor does he mention the some-
what delicate but interesting subject of the
dividends paid by other companies. Then he
refers, with pointless irrelevancy, to the ancient
and discredited law’ of supply and demand.
The co. also talks spaciously about the handing
over to Melb. citizens, at the end of the lease,
of the whole property free of cost—which is
ridiculous and altogether incorrect. The co.
does nob own the lines— i.e., the track. These
were built out of money borrowed “ on the
security of the interested municipalities,” and
the co., instead of paying a huge sum yearly
for the lease of the lines, merely provides the
interest on the borrowed money and a sinking
fund for the due redemption of the loans, both
put together being not more than the co. w ould
probably have had to pay in interest if it had
borrowed the construction money on its own
s ecurity. Sec. 24 provides that local autho-
rities may purchase the rolling - stock
and all other necessary outfit, at its then
value, in 1904—extended by the amending Act
to 1916 (sec. 8, Amending Act, ’B7). There is
no semblance of any “gift ” whatsoever on the
part of the co. Its capital, small originally,
lias since been nearly doubled out of its profits ;
it has, in addition, paid large dividends on the
capital really paid up and very respectable ones
even on the much-u'atered nominal capital ; and
it has 17 years of improving prospects and bulky
bonuses ahead of it. In brief, the co., in the
last 12 years or so, has duly provided for the
loan-interest and sinking-fund aforesaid, has
paid dividends averaging 12 per cent., and has
earned such bonuses that each original holder
of 100 shares nows owns 192, which,, at present
quotations, represent a value of -2140“ A, e
£5O originally paid-up. Not that any
ml iterf Imve any Immiug o» the case
matter really at issue IS that th. 00. mad. a
bargain, embodied in an Act of Parliament
ISbcie.n't stick to it. It remains to be s el.
what reply Premier Turner will give to the
co., and what move he will make, it any.
Potato Young’s Repentance.
About a week ago the Freetrade Government
of N.S.W. had an engineering contract to
give out, and the tender of a local firm—the
Clyde Engineering Co.—was not the lowest
bv a considerable distance. But, all the
same, the Clyde Engineering Co. got the
work. And the explanation tendered by
Potato Young, Works Minister, is that it was
done “ with a view to keeping the work in
N.S. W.,” even though doing so involved a
“ slightly increased cost.” Which is good Pro-
tectionist theory, and, undoubtedly, Potato
Young was right. If there are 100 workless and
penniless men, and these men remain alive aDd
don’t die of starvation, it is obvious that they
live on the community somehow —they and, in
many cases, their families also. They may
live by casual begging, by assistance from
the State or charitable institutions, by stealing,
by getting goods on credit and not paying for
them—having nothing to pay with. But,
having no means and yet remaining alive, the
community evidently pays the bill in one shape
or another. If each man and his family, sup-
posing him to possess one, pull through on
even so miserable a sum as 6s. a week, that
makes a total of .£3O a week —close on £4OO in
a quarter. And he can’t do that unless he
“ bilks ” his landlord, which i . v " ~ ~f
compulsory oh ity wi . runs i -
another £4OO for the crowd in the quarter.
Also, he has to carefully dodge his share of
the State taxation, and get clothes j
from some w he,
find three months’ employment for 100 men by
paying £lOOO v. ' contract than
if the work a•-rolJß((poipmunity
saves all that amount in charity. Also, it pre-
vents 100 men sinking from being useful mem-
bers of society into chronic loaferism, and averts
a hideous amount of misery from them and
their families ; and there is £30,000 more in
the country’s aggregate stock of coin than if
the work had been sent abroad. That is the
theory of Protection, and Potato Young has
apparently grasped it—so far as State con-
tracts are concerned, though he utterly fails
to grasp it as concerns private contracts.
So have his colleagues, for the Reid Govern-
ment has now followed for some time the
policy (so far as State contracts are con-
cerned) of keeping the work and the money
in the country, even where local tenders
were a trifle higher than outside ones. Yet the
Freetrade doctrine alleges that every country
should buy in the cheapest market, whether it
thereby deprives its own people of work and
bread or not, and regardless of the outflow of
money caused by foreign purchasing. And the
Reid Government calls itself a Freetrade
Ministry, and gets its salary under false pre-
tences by so calling itself, and it practises
Protection and heaps savage scorn on it at the
same time It doesn’t dare for very shame to
live quite up to its own brutal Freetrade creed
—the one it has preached all through its halting
existence, yet it goes on preaching. The spec-
tacle of Freetrader Potato Young advocating
the principle of “ keeping the work in the
country,” even at a slightly increased cost on
paper, is one of the best things in the bright
lexicon of Yes-No up to date.

The Nice-Old-Gentleman Party.
Very flat, like an egg dropped from a great
height, is the policy with which the M.L. Tory
party is going to fight the 1899 election against
its heavy-weight enemy, Richard, of Kumara.
Especially after the reports about the great
scrimmage which was to be made this time the
programme looks flatter and like an egg dropped
from a still greater height than it otherwise
would. Russele, proposes removing the Civil
Service from political influence and placing it
under the control of a Board, and the pro-
gramme about ends there. The rest is flotsam
and jetsam. The Tory party announces that if
it gets into power the labor and social legisla-
tion of the last eight years won’t be interfered
with except where experience has shown that
it can be improved—which opens up a wide
desert of mystery and conjecture. When each
separate item of that legislation was intro-
duced the Russell party denounced it as in-
sane and ruinous. Was it lying when it said
that—or is it lying now when it says the
legislation is good enough to stand ? And
whichever way it is lying, how can it be
trusted to improve, in a socialistic way, the
socialistic legislation which it so furiously
denounced? And does it intend to proceed
with more socialistic legislation because socialis-
tic legislation is good, or to stop short because
socialistic legislation is not good, and merely
tolerate what now exists in order to get office ?
It certainly doesn’t promise any more, so pre-
sumably it doesn’t admire the old Seddon
policy, and yet, as it isn’t going to openly
reverse that policy, it presumably intends to be
a degraded time-server selling its soul for
“ hoffis.” Only it reserves to itself the power
to undo a lot of the new institutions under the
pretence of improving them—for if it gets into
power it will be the sole judge of what is im-
provement. In a general way, therefore, its
attitude is: “So far as social legislation has
gone, we promise to give you just the same as
Seddon has done. The reason why you should
trust us instead of Seddon to guard the new
privileges conferred on you in the last
eight years is that we were always
against them. If you want more social legisla-
tion, the fact that we always fought against it
proves that we are the people to let you have it
—not the fellow who fought for it.” It is a
tolerably ridiculous attitude for any party to
assume, but the Russell party is there or
thereabouts. And, in addition, it talks vaguely
about reducing customs-duties and giving the
people that good old wheeze—a “ free breakfast-
table,” though why a free breakfast-table is
more advantageous than a free dinner or tea
table, or a free hunk of bread-and-cheese at 11
a.m., or a free bed, no one seems to know. At
present, bread, butler, cheese, meat, bacon,
egf'S, and vegetables are all free ; there is a nomi-
nal import-duty on some of them, but, as M.L.
supplies itself with all these, the duty is a dead
letter. And if Russell takes the duty off other
things, he must makeup for the lost revenue by
putting on other taxation, or selling more land,
or stopping the Old Age Pensions, or the con-
tributions out of revenue to public works,
or by borrowing. He doesn’t mention these
things, but as the miraculous cruse of oil is off
he must do some of them. And Russell him-
self is a rather pleasant, dilettante old gentle-
man— something of the hand-painted vase
description ; and when he bangs up against
that useful, hard-working, indomitable iron
pot, Dick Seddon, as they swirl together down
the fretted cataract of politics, things seem
never to go well with the nice old gentleman.
The Infallible Destruction of Things.
A new thing last week in the way of anti-
Federal scare was the discovery by Dr.
MacLaurin, M.L.C. (of N S. VV.), that Fede-
ration means the probable destruction of the
Queensland and N.S. VV. sugar-industry. The
doctor starts by carefully figuring-out that a
reasonable tariff would leave a shortage of
,£1,440,000 to be made up somewhere, and he
proceeds to ask :
Can any man seriously propose to raise this vast sum
of money by direct taxation in States already subject to
direct taxation of a very heavy character ?
The Scotch doctor doesn’t stop to remark that
not one of the Australias is heavily burdened
by direct taxation ; that Westralia and Queens-
land have neither land nor income-tax ; that
j totalisator-tax except in Queens-
land, and no absentee-tax except in S.A. ;• that
in Tasmania the land-tax is only |d. in the £ ;
and that in Victoria there is no land-tax on
properties less than one square mile in area, and
then only on any value over and above £2f>oo.
He simply rushes on to saiy-t-hat the other way
out seems to be an excise Of £5 lbs. per ton on
locally-grown sugar, and he rises to inquire :
Is it at all likely ./ajjandLflr*'"
districts of N.S.VV. would te S
which it was likely that their principal product would not
only be deprived of the protection it now enjoys, hut
would be also oppressed by an excise duty of £5 15s. a
ton ? At present the Richmond River farmer receives a
protection of £3 per ton, and is thereby enabled to com-
pete successfully with the German suarar-grrower, who en-
joys a bounty of 355. a ton. But if this protection were
to'be abolished and the Richmond River farmer had to
pay an excise equal to the Customs duty the German
sugar-grower has to pay, it is clear that in the competi-
tion the German sugar-grower would have an advantage
of 355. a ton—the amount of his bounty—and the Queens-
land farmer would be in no better position. I can
hardly fancy that even the strongest Federal enthusiasm
would induce the sugar-planters to enter a union in
which their industry must be infallibly destroyed by
oppressive taxation.
Which is correct enough, provided a sufficient
number of impossible things are assumed to
begin with. If these provinces were heavily
burdened by direct taxation, which they are
not ; and if it was impossible to raise more
direct taxation, which isn’t the case ; and if
the Commonwealth was therefore driven to put
£5 15s. per ton excise on local sugar ; and if it
was such an incredible ass as to fix the duty on
imported sugar at the same rate instead of put-
ting it up to .£lO to counteract the Ger-
man bounty, then the sugar industry would
be infallibly destroyed. In fact, if everybody
was sufficient of a fool, the infallible destruc-
tion of everything would be so infallible that
its infallibility would be something astonishing.
♦
More Identification.
On 7th July, 1898, one John O’Dea, a shop-
assistant, whilst walking along a dark avenue
on the confines of Adelaide, was assaulted by
three men and robbed of his watch and chain
and two sovereigns. O’Dka was taken to hos-
pital, and next morning, after same hesitation,
identified a certain John Holt as one of his
three assailants. (Here let it be explained that
Holt had been arrested about an hour after
the time of the assault, on a charge of vagrancy,
and nothing but a few coppers found on him.)
At the Supreme Court trial, although O’Dea’s
was the only direct evidence, and despite the
fact that the humane Judge Bundey summed
up in prisoner’s favor, Holt was convicted and
sentenced to seven years hard labor. Recently
two men named Lee and May, at present
undergoing a sentence for burglary, voluntarily
confessed that they had themselves committed
the assault in company with a third person, and
that Holt was entirely innocent. The
details of this voluntary confession have
not been made public, and the Crown shows
no disposition to give any information to Holt’s
friends or legal adviser, who have all along
stoutly maintained his innocence. Two facts
strongly support the theory of Holt’s inno-
cence : Although arrested an hour after the
alleged offence, he had none of the property or
money on him ; and the night being very dark,
and the spot where the assault occurred
situated in dense shade in an avenue of trees,
absolute identification was almost impossible.
Further, it is difficult to imagine that the other
two men confessed, for the mere fun of the
thing, to a serious crime which, they never com-
mitted. Once more—not one man in ten thou-
sand can identify a man whom he only sees for
a second or two in the dark, especially if a
sudden assault has scattered his senses to the
winds. If the pious Treasurer Holder had
been brought before O’Dea, dressed in old rags
and with his hair awry and his boots burst, and
introduced as a person in custody on suspicion,
he might have been identified just the same
way. Meanwhile, the man who says he didn’t
do it is working out his sentence, and the law
refuses to take the least notice of the men who
say they did do it. They can’t even get them-
selves tried for the offence.
Policeman Dungey and his Mate.
Thuspar. no feature of the ugly Dungey-
Bromley business looks more contemptible
than the legal suggestion that woman Bromley
was improperly arrested. On each occasion of
her appearance at Melb police-court one or two
lawyers have asked for her instant discharge,
aud the Bench has mildly replied that the
Court couldn’t see its way to end the matter
there and then. And then, having practically
admitted that the request for an instant dis-
charge was mere impudent “ bluff,” the Bench
each time remanded Mrs. Bromley for a week
for no other reason than that the Crown is
known to be endeavoring to work a Queen’s
pardon for policeman Dungey and accomplice
Bromley before their case can come to trial at
Melb. Crim. Court. The legal culpability of the
conspirators seems to be put beyond doubt by
the Vic. Government’s application for a royal
pardon, but pettifogging lawyers, in the face
of this fact, receive dumb official encourage-
ment to go on pleading that Mrs. Bromley’s
arrest is “ absolutely illegal.” Meanwhile the
blessed Law stands still, instead of moving
along its proper course, and waits for something
to turn up from London. No intelligent person
really believes that a Queen’s pardon for the
inglorious Dungey and the shameless Dora
Bromley will ever arrive. Colonial-Sec. Joe
Chamberlain has already advised Vic. Crown
Law Dept., to get out of its own dirty mess the
best way it can. He refuses to appeal for the
sympathy of a decent old-lady monarch on be-
half of a female who pretended to invite a
criminal operation on her person in order
that a sneaking accessory before the fact might
emerge from a place of concealment and arrest
the people whom she had bribed and begged to
get her “out of trouble.” If the Queen had
power to act either way in a case like this —if
she could punish as well as pardon—she would
doubtless discharge Dungey from the force,
even if she didn’t prescribe anything more un-
pleasant for him and Mrs. Dora Bromley. The
dirty case of policeman Dungey and his pal
Dora will presumably come up for trial sooner
or later (unless the people of Victoria show
themselves disposed to tolerate a gross mis-

albcmrue J.P.
The Melb. suburban Benches continue _
tinguish themselves. Carlton Court had before
it the other day a fairly strong young man Who,
it was proved, had deliberately thrown up a
billet obtained the day before, and had come
home and “ dealt it out ” to his wife—a delicate
young woman with a baby in her arms,
whom be knocked down and battered, black-
ing her eye and making her face a mass of
bruises. This blackguard was fined .£3 or one
month, whereas the day before, at same Court,
a poor old woman, who had “ given herself in
charge ” as utterly destitute, got six months’
imprisonment as an “ act of humanity.” Same
day, at Fitzroy Court, across the road, a well-
dressed woman, on whom was found <£l4, was
charged with stealing a purse containing 3s. 6d.
from a fellow tram-passenger. A local J.P. got
into the box, and told his fellow-J.P. on the
Bench that he had known accused for 40 years,
and had always believed her honest ; and that
she was in comfortable circumstances. Then
the other beak upreared himself, and distress-
fully observed that he had also known accused
for many years, and had thought her honest.
But he had a painful duty to perform. And
then, with Spartan firmness, he sentenced
accused to—“ the rising of the Court! ” And
even this, at the request of her solicitor, who
spoke movingly of the stigma, was subsequently
altered to a £2 fine, which was immediately
paid. Much less dangerous in Melbourne to be
a burglar, or a wife-beater, or a push-leader
than to be hard-up.
Sydney Telegraph, having failed by plain,
earthly dodges to get the Federal capital
planted just outside its own office in Sydney,
lately came out with a pome by one “J.
Lionel Pratt,” in which Pratt says that the
“Great White God” selected Sydney as the
Federal city. Also Pratt and God are going
to see to it that the Federal city is fixed
at Sydney sooner or later. Pratt starts
at the creation and states, among other
things : “ I will feed my port with two
rivers brave that will shine like tongues of
flame,” which is a wild, large way of describing
the feeble trickle of the Parramatta and Lane
Cove—the two little streams which practically
peg-out some 30 miles inland. But he adds,
with a crash and a bang, that God has decided
on Sydney for the Commonwealth capital, and
that, “ All other cities shall tribute send to
her, the queen of them all,” so evidently Lon-
don, New York, Rio, Buenos Ayres, Calcutta,
Bombay, Paris, and other like obscure spots,
may consider themselves crumpled up for
good. Then Pratt goes on to roar several
more times that God has fixed on Sydney as
the capital, and he is left roaring. How Pratt
came to know exactly what God wanted—well,
Pratt oqly know. Bub a prophet shouldn’t
be named Pratt —especially a prophet who
knows all about ~G!od in this large fashion;
the name looks ridiculous. And after Pratt’s
awful inaccuracy about the two brave rivers he
wants to be backed up by a big thunderstorm
or a good, large earthquake or some other evi-
dence. The fact that Pratt mistakes the Parra-
matta, crawling between its smelly upper mud-
flats, and the Lane Cove for two vast rivers is
excusable—it can be set down to Pratt’s igno-
rance ; but when Pratt says that God makes
the same mistake, one is apt to have doubts
about Pratt’s revelation.

It is but a month or so since Premier Turner
assured an inquiring M.L.A. that persons were
no longer being gaoled in Victoria for want of
a better way of disposing of them. Yet, the
other day, at Melb. City Court, an old Yarra-
banker got 12 months, as a vagrant. The old
chap had done nothing in particular, hadn’t
beaten his wife, nor stoushed a constable, nor
raided an hotel for free drinks. He was just
an inoffensive old buffer who reposed in bloated
luxury on old newspapers by the aromatic
Yarra, and had, at all hazards, to be cut short
in that wild career of iniquity. No community
which feels bound to gaol a man for poverty has
any right to oall itself civilised.

A few of the declining days of the Mac-
Mahon season at Sydney Lyceum (season de-
clines finally in a few weeks) are being gilded by
a revival of old Father Boucicault’s “Octoroon.”
There are always a few possibilities left in the
veteran drama, though it has been woefully vul-
garised by the penny barnstormer who has
struggled with it through the bear and ’possum
country, and very often left it there. Moreover,
“ Uncle Tom ’ has done a great deal to bring
every kind of slave drama into contempt, and the
utterly uncalled-for death of Little Eva all over
Australia is a serious handicap to this kind of
play. All the same, the gallery always likes a
drama wherein a pretty girl-slave is put up on the
table for sale, provided the table is high enough
to show her ankles ; and it also likes the streak of
sickly pathos at the end, when Zoe suicides to
avoid being affectionately mauled by her new
owner, Jacob M'Closky, and then the heavens
open and one sees the ghost walking on nothing
and without boots in a better land. There
is a good deal of sickly pathos in the
“Octoroon,” and its sentiment mostly depends on
the thrilling assurance that Jacob M'Closky is
foing to take his fair young purchase forcibly
ome to the place where he leads his bear-like' ex-
istence, and there wallow in sin. Salem Scudder
is a redeeming feature in the play, though that
quaint, dry character is always on the point of
stoushing Jacob through five acts, and leaves
Jacob unstoushed to the end. Diver drops his
usual quick, nervous delivery for once, and does
Salem slowly and impressively as a tired Yankee
with lots of time to spare in a hot, tired country
should be done. Salem is very much alike as a
rule, and wears the same long coat and dirt-
colored tuft on his chin, and whittles the
same lump_ of wood. Miss Burdette’s octo-
roon girl is charming all through, and her
death, in a neat white dress, is generally deplored,
though the fact that Miss Ivy Gorrick remains
alive is a little compensation. The old, casual
nigger of Frank Harcourt is also a fine piece
of work, but Jacob M’Closky’s manner of shaking
himself for 15 minutes all over the place before
he meets his just doom at the hands of
the good drunk Indian is a woe. Jacob has nearly
shuddered himself to death before the Indian
comes on the scene, and the best thing that could
be done would be to take away his boat, and leave
him in the swamp, and let him shudder.
• • • •
The story of the “Octoroon” turns largely
on a very ridiculous camera which takes the photo, of
little Paul, and also, in a casual way, snatc hes the
likeness of Jacob M‘Closky while he is butchering
the amusing little coon in order to get possession
of the Incriminating Document. Paul falls down
out of range, and Jacob flies with the property,
and then a plain garden camera would go on
photographing the scenery and thereby reduce
Jacob to a mere blur. But this good Christian
instrument stops short when it has caught Jacob's
likeness, and the picture of that coarse person leads
to his downfall. The camera is deservedly battered
into eight pieces by the moral Indian, who after-
wards buries little Paul in parts unknown—at least
his body never turns up again.

The “ Geisha ” music babbles pleasantly
over its pebbles at Her Majesty’s theatre, and,
after dropping in and taking another instalment
of it now-and-then, it begins to strike The Bulle-
tin as a very pleasant babblement. It seems to
soak into the listener more on a second hearing—
or possibly the listener grows more porous as time
goes on. This paper’s conviction is that the
‘ Geisha ” ought to be an immoral play, but some-
how missed its vocation. It utterly disbelieves
in the honorable intentions of the. huge Jappy
potentate who buys Dorothy Vane, and when that
person.professes to be enraged at Chinaman Wun
interrupting the wedding by standing on his
best chrysanthemum, it is all pretence —there
is no wedding intended. Lauri puts new trim-
mings on the part of Chinaman Wun from time to
time ; besides he is a comedian who can extract a
vast amount of joy from very small material, and
unless someone drives a twopenny ’bus over Lauri
there can be no eartldy doubt about the continued
Buccess of the “Geisha.” From the moment he
came in on the opening night and said “O, cli ! ”
or something like that, all doubts were set at rest.
There is nothing very surprising about “O, cli! ”
but when Lauri says it that little stunted objur-
gation moves the house to its inmost soul.

Another change is due at Sydney Royal
on Saturday, when “ The Work Girl ” will be
introduced. This is a drama which depends
largely on an oily sweater called Genesis —but he
has to fly so suddenly when the girls rise in revolt
that he ought to be called Exodus. There are
two versions of the “Work Girl.” In one the
insurgents drive Genesis round the room—he is
trying hard to be Exodus, but there are too many
girls between him and the door —and finally chase
him under the table with his shirt nearly torn off.
In the other version, the largest and most aggres-
sive girl gets him by the pants as he goes under,
and nis braces burst, and the pants and the girl
stagger one way, while Genesis emerges on the
other side and flies for his life, dressed principally
in an evil conscience and the table-cloth. The
gallery crowd prefers the second version. “English
Rose ” has done moderate business, but it probably
isn’t new enough for more than a two weeks’
season, so the English landlord will be shot on
Friday night for the last time.
* * * *
It is stated that before Holloway and
Anderson remove their show to the Lyceum at
Easter that house is to be thoroughly renovated.
Therefore the present seems a good time to implore
the new management to have the gallery repapered.
The cheap haxr-oil from Bill’s head has been accu-
mulating on the old paper since the theatre was
built, and Bill’s grime isn’t a nice thing to look up
at from tfie regions below. There has been many
a wild Saturday night rush in these upper regions ;
and Nipper has fallen against (linger while
struggling for a front place for himself and the
girl in tne red hat, and Ginger has staggered
against Micky, and Micky has fallen into Bill, and
Bill has fallen against the wall—which has led to
all the trouble. If the management could only
invent a new kind of reboundable wall which
would throw Bill into the middle of next week it
would have its advantages.

The return of Bellman and Lottie Moore
to the Tivoli is a pleasing event, for even the most
capable ventriloquist may become a trifle weari-
some, no matter how recklessly he throws his
voice in many directions. The bright American
Lottie, with the tinge of sunset in her curls and
her reckless somersault in the green shoes, has
always been a favorite in Sydney, partly because
she looks really happy at all times. The variety-
girl always tries to look like that, but very often
her smile is only a pained spreading-out of the
countenance, and its obvious unreality gets on the
nerves.
* * * *
A host of friends and acquaintances of
Kreitmayer, the Melbourne Waxworks proprietor,
are sorry to hear that the veteran is insolvent. In
Melbourne’s boom times, when Phil Stuart was
running small sensations and novelties at the old-
established crib, Kreitmayer seemed to have a
comfortable future before him, but the supply of
rural visitors dropped off, and the Waxworks
nowadays has little to show beyond a few dozen
dingy effigies and a- "'ho is even more
depressing than her waxen companions.

Nellie Stewart’s artistic thoroughness in
the Drury Lane panto, gets due appreciation from
one of the Sunday critics : —“There are principal
boys whose vivacity in their own scenes is only
equalled by their apathy when others claim the
centre. Miss Stewart is busy all the time. ” To
which her old Australian admirers cry “Hear,
hear!” We never saw Nellie part company for
an instant with the character she was ’.performing.
She didn’t recognise any friends in • stage'boxes,
or stalls, or corner seats of the dress-circle. She
didn’t make a great show of cutting private jokes
with other members of the co., nor did she osten-
tatiously grin at somebody lurking in the “ wing.”
Cheap little bits of goods who are not pretty, or
well-shaped, who can’t dance, sing, or act in the
same street with a Nellie Stewart— they ogle their
acquaintances and take liberties with the audi-
ence. And if the audience is mostly satisfied,
what’s the odds ?
* * * *
“ The White Heather ” has evidently come
to stay for some weeks, at Melb. Royal, notwith-
standing a general female lament over the unex-
jiected wickedness of dear Walter Baker. This is
a matter for shrill discussion in trains and trains
after the performance. The present scribe, who
lives in a suburb where the hero in question was,
seemingly, adored for his virtue as well as his
beauty until he bought an eyeglass and turned
stockbroker, has much pleasure in supporting the
resolution that Baker’s new character is “a great
shame.” It wouldn’t so much matter if he were
not overtaken by a horrible fate in the third act.
A live Baker would be something for feminine
recollection to cling to after the police had led him
away, but a dead Baker decomposing in the
waters under the earth, with a goblin helmet on
his head, and prawns creeping down the severed
air-tube to feed upon his cold features and lay
eggs in his eyelet holes, is about the most heart-
rending notion on Melbourne record.
• * * *
Two other people die in the course of
“The White Heather.” Charles Brown, who ap-
pears as the ain gran’sire to the future Duke of
Shetland, and puts several effective bits of acting
to his credit, is killed by a fall in Rand mining
shares and other financial difficulties. When last
seen, he is lying on the floor of the London Stock
Exchange, surrounded by jobbers, who unanim-
ously raise their hats in tho presence of their
fallen brother. It subsequently appears that none
of them took a hat round for the benefit of Brown’s
family. Then Baker expires, as aforesaid, after a
brief struggle, which would be all the better for a
little elaboration, and, in the next place, Albert
Norman has a death - scene that lasts some-
what too long. Altogether, “ The White
Heather ” is a harrowing drama, relieved
by lumps of comedy business, changes of
scenery, al fresco luncheons, and gorgeous
costumes. Miss Ross is a dream of rich raiment
all the evening, but Mrs. Bland Holt as Queen
Elizabeth, and Miss Watson as Mary Queen of
Scots, run the other lady very close at the finish.
Also, Miss Fitzmaurice Gill gives a scrumptious
impersonation of Lady Godiva at some private
theatricals where Bland Holt instructs a regiment
of countesses in a jiggetty-jiggetty chorus. Like-
wise, Miss Gill in a white biking suit is an oppor-
tunity to be embraced if possible. At one time or
other all the ladies on the bill look adorable, and
the persistency with which they wear something
different in the next scene is very kind indeed.
Lovely woman never wearies of well-dressing.
» • * *
Coming at the end of a long season, and
having more literary work and human nature in it
than the average melodrama, “ The White
Heather ” attracts attention to the company's
mechanical methods and lack of versatility. It
doesn’t matter that Bland Holt is always his
cheerful self, for Blandolt’s voice and personality
are always popular in a comedy part, and in this
case he knocks the multitude rather harder than
usual by means of a “gag”—the initial-letter
“gag”—which Billy Florence of old worked in
“The Mighty Dollar.” Neither is Mrs. Bland
Holt’s soubrettish caricature of a duke’s sister a
deplorable circumstance* Mrs. H. is a humor-
ist who keeps the house in good humor, and
her business with the steel poker at the
“ Godiva ” rehearsal is absurdly funny. But the
eternal sameness of Miss Wat-son, and Miss Ross,
and Albert Norman, and, in a less degree, of
the stalwart Walter Baker, grows monotonous as
the season advances, and is especially noticeable
just now. Miss Ross doesn’t attempt to vary her-
self. Her acting, ap?irt from her measured elocu-
tion, is limited to a sweet stagey smile, an elegant
bend in the back, :wy ; |jpy,ation of the eyebrows, a
swanlike turn of the neck, .^nd,an enchanting gaze
at one particular boy in tlie'gallery. The present
writer can’t say for certain whether it is the same
small boy every night, but in any case he objects to
the monopoly of Miss R. ’s eye by a sixpenny gawd.

The Brough Comedy Co. revived “The
Liars ” on Saturday at the Princess’s, and shone
brightly in that clever, convincing narrative.
“The Liars” is probably a 20 per cent, tonier-
looking show at the Firm’s theatre than it was at
the Bijou, and the company has improved its
performance with practice. Brough, who is get-
ting good houses now, may be rewarded with a
Seat crowd on Saturday, when “ One Summer’s
ay ” will be staged for the first time here, and
Miss Noble will make her reappearance. Mean-
time, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—
“ Madame Sans-Gene ” is bearding Buonaparte in
his den.
** * *
The return of Peggy Pryde is announced
to shake things up at the Bijou on Saturday night
(25th); also the lively Peg will do likewise, The
Bulletin presumes, at a matinee in aid of the
Homes of Hope Orphanage. Fitzgeralds’ Circus
duly passed away to Tasmania, and Melbourne at
the present moment has only three theatres on
the job.

Mrs. Brown-Potter, says the cable, has
been engaged to create the leading part in a new
play by H. A. Jones, due next April. If this is a
modern comedy part the Potterian mannerisms
will probably excite the same old conflict of
ridicule on the one hand and extravagant praise on
the other that has been waged around Mrs. P. ’s
performances here and elsewhere. La belle Cora
as Miladi in “ The Three Musketeers ” is one thing,
and doubtless a very fascinating thing at that. As
a fin-de-siecle heroine of a typical H. A. Jones
story she is likely to make the cockney “gods”
rather mad with her. But perhaps Jones is trying
his hand this time at a romantic historical play of
the “Red Robe ” or “Lady Ursula” style.
** * *
Judging from photos, of the London co.
engaged in “The Adventure of Lady Ursula,”
the Brough co. are quite as effective in a pictorial
sense. The legs and deportment of the original
she-male are much the same as Mrs. Brough’s; the
other Sir George doesn’t look as handsome and
courtly as Carne, who takes the part at
Melb. Princess’s ; nor is the lordly brother up to
Mario Majeroni in appearance. Likewise, Reg.
Dartrey’s Mr. Dent compares favorably with
the Dent in the imported pictures, and Brough’s
last century parson is quite a convincing figure.
Nevertheless it must be assumed that the London
performers manage to give the artificial play an
air of genuineness which is lacking at the Prin-
cess’s. They have a ring of truth in their voices,
possibly. Mrs. Brough’s elocution is very forced
as a rule ; Carne speaks his lines easily but with-
out much feeling ; and some of the others are
mechanical talkers.
At Poverty Point.
The rumor that Henry Irving is in financial difficulties
sounds like a truly lamentable fact. When he was mak-
ing tens of thousands a year at the Lyceum, and by his
American tours, Irving disbursed the gold like a "good
fairy in all sorts of ways for the benefit of the profession.
Old actors and actresses whose services he seldom or
never utilised were put upon his salary-list—pensioners
practically. He scattered donations, purchased plays
and playlets which he didn’t want, for the sake of the men
who had written them, and gave cash assistance to any
theatrical cause that had any claim upon his generosity.
He may have been a very unsatisfactory actor sometimes
in unsuitable parts, but nobody ever questioned Irving’s
greatness in his favorite character of Benefactor. And
now, since the illness of actor Irving has disabled the
business of showman Irving (a trouble always likely to
happen under the “ star ’’-manager system), it is feared
that he will never more be the Benefactor he was.
“Prynne” : Apropos Miss Rose Musgrove. Why should
Mr. Musgrove he so horrified at her appearing in his own
theatre, and certainly the foremost in Australasia? Such
things give a color to the antagonists of the stage. Every
theatrical performer, from the highest to the lowest, is
averse to seeing his children in the profession. Take
such as E. Kean, C. Kemble, Vandenhoff, Yates, Irving,
Jefferson, Macready.
Npllie Stewart scores one of her biggest successes in
the Drury Lane panto, with a drum-solo —much the same
solo, no doubt, which she played in comic opera
(“Pepita?) in days of yore. Australia has almost for-
gotten that Nellie is a daisy on the drum.
Demise, a few weeks ago, in England, Mrs. Charles
Mathews, widow of the comedian, who visited Australia
28 years ago, bringing her with him. Mathews’ first wife
was Madame Vestris. After her death he visited America,
where he encountered his second charmer, then Mrs.
Davenport—a plump, handsome blonde, who dwells in
the memory of all who have seen her. Her husband, an
actor, assaulted Mathews in New York rather severely.
Mr. and Mrs. Mathews were accompanied to Australia by
that pleasant little fellow, Chas. Mathews, jun., adopted
son of the comedian. He appeared in one or two of their
plays, and is now a leading barrister in London.
At Sydney Lyceum, on the first night of the present
“Octoroon” revival, Jacob M'Closkey found in the old
Judge’s desk the paper which gave the slave-girl, Zoe,
her liberty, and read out the date—some time in 1871.
And slavery came to an end in Louisiana when the Solid
South went down, and all the Confederate paper-money
was repudiated in ’65.
Geraldine Oliffe, the fine actress who was with the
Brough cq. a few years back—the Australian public saw
too little of her—created the part of Miss Jenison, the
adventuress, in H. A. Jones’“ Rogue’s Comedy,” on her
return to London. Jones has just published his comedy,
and this is how he describes Miss Jenison : “ A striking
woman of uncertain age, pale face, keen, searching eyes,
soft, agreeable manners.” The author selected Miss
Oliffe for the part—and how well his description of the
character fits the woman who played it!
Dear Bulletin. —Doesn't your London correspondent
talk a lot of nonsense re Ellen Terry—“ totterinsr, dod-
dering, moth-eaten, rheum-eyed, quavering, treble-voiced,
old?” Ellen Terry is stilt in the ft>rti6B-about half-way
bet ween the ages of, say, Nellie Stewart and Sarah Bern-
hardt. And several years younger than Patti, who lately
married the brawny president of an amateur athletic
club. O. P. [Terry is 51, and Patti £6 ;so there now!

So painful a piece of news is the arrest of vocalist Jules
Simonsen in San Francisco for alleged burglary that Tim
Bulletin hopes there is a mistake somew here. Simonsen
(Frances Saville’s brother, and well-known in Australia)
is stated to have attributed his doings to absolute starva-
tion ; which is an extraordinary thing in the case of an
artist of such fair quality.
The latest re Burgess. An enterprising showman in-
terviewing this scribe last week offered him a share in the
following venture. He is in treaty with Burgess to secure
him for a show over Queensland. There may be money
in it. “ Walk in, walk in ! Burgess, the gentleman
arrested for the Gatton murder, is on view,” would surely
appeal to the servant girl with sixpence in her promi-
nently-carried alligator-skin purse.
An ancient show is in trouble. Kreitmayer, of Melb.
Waxworks, has “ filed.” Debts, £2241. Assets (chiefly
wax figures), £2OO. This is about the oldest show' in
Australasia, it having been founded in the fifties by
Madame Sohier, who made a pile out of it. As a show it
has a higher value than the intrinsic, as many of the
exhibits are the original instruments of the crimes and
criminals represented.
At Paddington (Sydney) Police Court last week a witness,
Thomas King, described himself as a theatrical agent,
“the last link hetween the old school and the new”; he
had been, he said, 48 years in the profession. There are
some other “ old links ” in Sydney, Joe Rayner (aged 82),
J. J. Welsh and J. Hasker. A benefit, in substance, not
name, would prove very acceptable to the last three.
To such an extent did Melb. take its boot-box sensa-
tion to its bosom that the Argus deemed it expedient to
announce time and place of inquest with the of/ieramuse-
ments under “To-Day’s Arrangements” heading.
What a pity that Miss Mabelle Darley hasn’t more tone
in her singing voice. At the recent Theatrical Fund
matinee in Melbourne, the little lady sang “The beating
of my own heart ” with admirable taste and distinctness
of enunciation. Kenningham’s pianoforte accompani-
ment was equally artistic.
Clever Fanny Wentworth, the lady humorist of
Rickards’s ill-appreciated “speciality” co., is back again
in London and going strong as ever. The Morning
Post makes particular reference to her treatment of “a
very neat song which she picked up during her recent
visit to Australia. It is a parody on ‘ The Tin Gee-Gee,’
written at the expense of Prince Ranjitsinjhi, who is sup-
posed to be jealous of the greater popularity of Jones. It
is a really witty little song, and was received with bound-
less favor.” Miss Wentworth picked up “The Tin
Ran, jee ” from The Bulletin, hut it has been “ Anglicized
and softened down by myself,” she writes. Also, she
sends along a specimen verse from her song, “ Looks
well on the bills,” a smart little thing of her own which
would be quite worth quoting if it were not confined to
the topic of Hoolev and his company promoting. Aus-
tralia is tired of Hooley.
Ventriloquist Winton lately gotmarried in M.L.— presum-
ably with his friend, “ M’Ginty,” as best man. The bride
was Miss Clara Llewellyn, a Sydney songstress, whose
splendid contralto would be ringing" in English concert-
halls if its possessor would but adopt the pushful
methods of the average Australienne with a squeak.
A. G. Poulton, formerly well-knowm to Australians as a
young actor of the “rorty” type, is colleagueing with
“Teddy” Lonnen in a music-hall burlesque sketch,
wherein they play about a dozen characters between
them.
The lady who provided a nine-days’ sensation by un-
dressing herself on a high trapeze has been improved
upon by one of the Rhine Maidens, who performs in a
tank at the London ’alls. This particular maiden- hesi-
tates to join her sisters in the tank, so they pull her,
fully clothed, into the water, where she "gracefully
“ peels ” down to a swimming-costume.
“I am Marcus Superbus—by Wilson Barrett, out of
Great Cresar’s Ghost.”—Bland Holt in “The White
Heather.”
“ ilaresfoot” : Apropos Harry Power being Scotch. The
best Irish comedians have not been Irish. Tyrone Power
was Welsh. Harry’s first connection with theatricals was
as drummer-boy in the orchestra of Coppin’s little
wooden Pantheon Theatre, Cremorne Gardens, Melb.
“ V.” ; Bernhardt has acted before Queen Victoria, but
only in private, at Cimiez. Perhaps it rests with Melba
herself as to whether she shows before the Queen. There
is some prestige in being able to do without royalty. And
royalty, vice or otherwise, is deadheady.
These provinces are blessed with quite a collection of
theatrical managements whose trail of unpaid bills can
be traced in almost every town in Australasia. Times are
bad for the Australian mummer, and he or she must
needs work for the manager who doesn’t pay in order to
keep from dropping out of sight. The chance of getting
an engagement with the manager who does pay mostly
depends on hanging on somehow and keeping before the
public. Therefore even the most notorious managerial
fraud can get some kind of a co. together, and make
them provide their own costumes, and get hold of a play
of which the copyright has run out; and, if the theatre
has been long empty, the landlord will probkbly take his
very dubious cheque for the first week’s rent,.and then
the only thing that he has to sprint from very actively is
the gas-bill.
When the habit of falling down dead gets into a family
it is-often hard to eradicate. Last Nov. Edilh Marlowe
fell down dead in a N.Y. theatre, while playing a part in
“ The Christian.” Her sister, Virginia, fell down dead on
the stage in Boston in ’96. And their joint father fell
down dead on the stage in ’74.
“Cockney”: The comic stage Chow is doubtless, as
“S.S.” suggested, a purely Hingiish invention. Forty
or fifty-years ago a musical humorist gave the Londoners
a pig-tailed impersonation of a heathen, who capered
like a cat on hot bricks, and with his elbows pressed
against his ribs and his forefingers pointing upwards
warbled an inane ditty re an alleged “ Feast of the Lan-
terns” in Pekin. His awful song had a refrain—“ Ching-
a-ring-a-ring-ting, Feast of the Lanterns,” &e., &c. Never
saw him myself (he was a bit before my time), but got an
early impression of him from a frivolous uncle who oft
would amuse himself by prancing and pointing his fore-
fingers, and “ ching-a-ring-tinging ” for my entertain-
ment. Johnnie Wallace, as the humorous Chow in “ New
Babylon,” at Melb. Royal, carried my thoughts back to
“ Ching-a-ring.”

way-carriage—“ Yes, got a job at last. I’m at the

Westralia’s revenue for the seven months to
31st Jan., 1899, was £1,396,229, and expenditure £1,533,370,
so the deficit, so far, is £137,141. The great marvel now
is where on earth Forrest is getting the money to struggle
along with from day to day. One rumor (it may he only
a rumor) is that he has borrowed so much from the local
Savings Bank that that institution has very little cash to
go on with, and in case of a panic would have to pay in the
Treasury bills of Bigjohn’s Government, unless the State
came to the rescue with a loan from the banks or an issue
of legal-tender paper-money. The latter would probably
be the wiser expedient, if kept within moderate limits.
The boom is coming home to roost in the W.A. Treasury,
mainly in the way of interest on the loans which were
floated with a light heart in the giddy past. From July
to December, ’97, the interest bill was £157,286 ; July-
December, ’9B, it was £209,736. Which increase is a
pleasant spectre to clank its chains by Bigjohn’s pillow
when John is dreaming in the night with his martial
overdraft wrapped round him.

Maoriland started its financial year at Ist April,
1898, with a surplus of £171,141, and after allowing
£lOO,OOO for Old Age Pensions it now' appears likely that
it will wind up at 31st March, ’99, with a credit balance of
about £481,000. At this rate the year’s surplus will be
about £310,000. If any province can do w'ithout borrow-
ing, it is Maoriland, with its steady prosperity and its
ever-increasing revenue. Yet the usual big loan has just
been floated, and one or two more loans will turn the
Srosperity into a feverish boom, and then the ghastly
urst will follow, and the country will wonder, as usual,
how the thing came about.

Victoria’s J 21,600,000 3 per cent, loan was sub-
scribed twice over, and, after paying all expenses, the
province gets about £93 10s. or £94 for each £lOO. If the
loan runs its full term of 50 years, therefore, it will cost
about £3 ss. 6d. per cent., including loss at maturity.
But, in the meantime, the province pays only about
£3 4s. interest, and the loss on repayment is left to pos-
terity. If Victoria had cared to make it a 3J per
cent, loan, and drop the empty dignity of being
able to pretend that its credit is good for 3 per
cent, when it isn’t, it could probably have sold its
loan at par, and thereby saved the addition of £lOO,OOO to
its permanent debt by paying about £l9OO a year more
interest. The Seven Provinces among them now owe
about £10,000,000 which can’t be accounted for, and they
have fooled away this among them by pretending to be
able to borrow at a low r er rate of interest than their credit
could stand, in order that they might blow about the
miserable sham afterwards.

_JThe bankrupt municipality of Lambton (N.S.
Wales) asks the State to come to its assistance, as it has
done in the past with Sydney, Penrith, and Lismore.
Lambton (population 3400) floated a huge loan of £B6OO
with the Commercial Bank of Australia to light up the
town by electricity, and it borrowed this money at the
absurd rate of 7§ per cent, or thereabouts. It also bor-
rowed another £3OOO at 6 per cent., and it has £4OOO
other liabilities at as high as 8J per cent. Then it went
broke (any small place might on these terms), tried
ineffectually to repudiate its liability to the bank on a
technical point, and finally had the bailiff put in. As the
whole revenue won’t nearly pay interest, Lambton wants
the State to advance the money at 3£ per cent, to pay 14s.
in the £, and the creditors to forego the other 6s. in the
£ and change the subject.

Last year (1898) the deposits in the Savings
Bank of N.S.IV. increased by £9915. In 1894 the deposits
decreased by £49,500, mainly because the people who had
rushed their money in there as the only safe place, in the
year when banks and building societies were going down
like the famous swine in Galilee, began to recover and
draw it out again. But, with this exception, the average
increase for many years has been about £200,000 per.
annum. The average amount at credit of each depositor’s
account is now £56 10s. 6d.—being £1 14s. lOd. less than a
year previously. Also, the reserve-fund has decreased
from £227,494 to £210,406, the balance being applied to
write-off depreciation of assets.

Mr. George Crowley, manager of the City
Mutual Life Assurance Society, writes :—“ With regard to
the last paragraph of your critique of last year’s balance-
sheet of this society, in your issue of 18th inst., will you
allow me to say that it is perfectly true that I did not act
in the matter referred to except upon the instructions of
the directors and the advice of the society’s solicitor on
the facts known to me. I was not allowed, however, to
show this at the hearing, and consequently the matter has
been made to appear as a personal one. Unless the Privy
Council, to whom I am appealing, will allow me to show my
absolute bona-fidm, it is my intention to make the matter
my own private affair in spite of the directors’ wish to the
contrary.” [This is in reference to The Bulletin’s re-
mark that, if the law-costs and possible damages in the
libel-action wherein an ex-official of the City Mutual was
plaintiff and manager Crowley nominal defendant had to
come out of next year’s profits, the said profits would be
struck a very hard knock.]

The prosperous New Zealand Accident Insur-
ance Co. had a lovely year in 1898. The year’s profits
were £BOOl, equal to eighty per cent, on the nominal
paid-up capital of £lO,OOO, or 160 per cent, on the £5OOO
which the shareholders put up in actual cash. The last
eight years’ profits of this co. are as follows :
Profit. Dividend.
1891 .. £2,349 .. 12J per cent. = £625
1892 .. 1,598 .. „ = 625
1893 .. 1,637 .. „ = 625
1894 .. 4,563 .. „ = 625

1897 .. 10,812 .. 10 percent. = 1000
1898 .. 8,001 .. „ = 1000
£38,762 * £6OOO
In 1897 the co. took into profit £5OOO of the accumulated
balance at credit of the Fidelity Guarantee Fund, and
transferred it again to capital. Therefore the situation
is this: The N.Z. Accident Co. started with a paid-up
capital of £5OOO, which is all the actual cash put up by
the shareholders. On that sum it has paid, in the last
eight years, four 12 ! /£ per cent dividends ; two of 15 per
cent., and two of 20 per cent. Last year’s profits were
160 per cent, on the shareholders’ original capital. The
average profits for eight years have been over ninety per
cpnt. per annum on the original capital. Since 1891 the
co. has added £5OOO to its capital, £26,000 to its
reserve funds, and £1762 to its accumulated pro-
fit balance, all out of earnings. Its income from
investments, all of the best character, is £2471, sufficient,
if the co. retired altogether from the insurance business.

Balmain New Ferry Co. (Sydney) has a half-

Der cent, per annum on capital. A half-year s dividend
at 10 per cent, per annum absorbs £64B—at least the report
savs so! though how 5 per cent, on £13,594 only comes to
£648 no fellah can be expected to understand. Last nail
year 5 per cent, on £13,594 also came to £648 -it seems to
be done by an unaccountable process of something ac-
cruing from forfeited shares, though what it is that
accrues isn’t clear. The insurance reserve vanished at
the time when the co.’s boats did their lamented blaze-
up but there is a reserve of £3OO for equalisation of divi-
dends and £l9Ol remains at credit of profit and loss
after the dividend is paid and the mysterious
thing has finished “accruing.” As the company
made £8826 by forfeiture of shares for unpaid
calls, and its total visible reserves are £2201, as des-
cribed above, it seems to have really managed, in its
seven years existence, to divide £625 more than its earn-
ings : the forfeited capital hasn’t gone to any visible
reserve, but appears to have just melted into the general
funds The present outlook seems .very favorable, but
the co’s way of keeping its accounts by dynamite, as it
were, is rather amusing at times.

The Industrial and Provident Permanent Bene-
fit Building and Investment Society, of Sydney (which
ought to be a boa-constrictor instead of a bank to corres-
pond with the length of its name), closed its 28th year at
31st Dec., 1898. This is one of the few concerns which
paid dividends steadily all through the great burst—7 per
cent, in 1892, ’93, and ’94, and 6 per cent, since then. This
year the 6 per cent, absorbed 1791 more than the profits,
so, apparently, there is a chance of only 5 per cent, in
future. There are only £2405 of deposits ; apart from
that, the institution trades solely on its own capital,
which is obviously the reason why it. has survived the
storm so well. But, by the steady withdrawal of capital,
it is becoming a very small concern nowadays ; three
years ago the paid-up capital was £113,000, and now it is
down below £65,000. At the same time, it looks a very
safe little concern, and the needless elongation of its name
is the only possible objection to it.
Eight pounds per cent, was the quotation for
fire insurance on some Coolgardie central hotel premises
the other week. The owner accepted for a limited sum,
but the matter had not been fixed before a fire swept the
lot.

A statement of the number of; Broken. Hill
Water shares now held in London (the register there has
been open a little over 12 months) would be interesting.
It is said that since the local movement to secure a public
supply, either Govt, or municipal, was begun, there has
been a general unloading Bullwards. Though there are
5000 dwellings in Broken Hill, there are only 957 water-
services—con vincing proof of the inadequacy and unpopu-
larity of the supply. The local Labor-party makes the
ownership of a supply, this or some other, the first plank
in its platform; and several of the mining co’s look on
approvingly. t .
After nearly two years,.spending over <£12,000,
and paying the responsible official £lOOO a-year, it has
dawned on several Ms.P. that the N.S.W. Govt. Metal-
lurgical Works are—as the writer described them when
being built —useless toys. A three-head stamp-mill
erected “ on trial’’—all else in keeping—treated to date
less than 500 tons, at a cost of over £2O a ton. The size
of these works is in keeping with the minds of the men
responsible for their erection —wluujught to suffer for it.
Homeward Bound, N.S.W.—“Struck rich rock;
about 20 tons of it taken out and deposited in safety. It
will, at least, go 7oz. to the ton, and the whole 12ft.,
between lowest floor of quarry and roof of tunnel, looks
well Developing surface with the view of ascertaining
width and direction.” Reads like a big development in a
remarkably low-grade mine, on which a pile of money has
been spent in plant and law, and for which over £20,000
oash was paid. Yalwal badly wants a boom.

The official estimate of the value of opal won
from White Cliffs (far west N.S.W.) in ’9B-is £lOO,OOO.
But the warden cheerfully acknowledges that it is quite a
guess. In view, of repeated accusations of opal-stealing—
half the men on -the field have been under the imputation
at one time or another—the licensing of gem-buyers is
urgently needed. Even the warden, in his.offioial report,
refers to the “ extraordinary increase ” which took place
in the quantity of gem returned to the owners upon
certain changes in percentage, &c., being recently made.
* * * *
At White Cliffs (N.S.W.) opal-field, water is
almost unprocurable. Even when obtainable, it is only
at a cost of Bs. per lOOgal. in the town, and a still higher
price outside. The Govt, tank is dry, and water has to be
carted 4)4 miles with horses (horsefeed is V4O per ton),
from a tank leased to a Chinaman, who charges 2s. per
lOOgal., and Govt, is to be asked to grant a sum of money
for carting water to indigent persons. The local popula-
tion is about 1500, all told, and, unless it soon rains or
other relief comes, about 1000 of them will have to make
for one of the bends of the Darling.

Trouble penda between two of the Broken Hill
mines. Initial cause : bad surveying. As a result, one
mine has driven over the other mine’s boundary, and has
also sloped out some of its ore. Nasty thing this latter.
Surveying in the mine has been so faulty that all. the
levels,' on a recent re-survey, proved to be “ out ” several
feet. , .

Sulphide Corporation (B.H. Central) auditors
certify that, after allowing for administration charges,
the approximate net profit for the eight weeks ending
Aug. 29 last amounted to £B2OO, and for the eight weeks
ended Oct. 24 (when further works were completed)
£12,200. Apparently also in the latter period were iii-
cluded some of the returns from zinc “ tailings,” which
were sold for 15s. per ton on the mine. The writing-off
debit-balances from the working of the Ashcroft process
was avowedly to clear the way for divs. As to divs., the
proposal is to pay, first, 10 per cent, on £1 to preference
shareholders, then 10 per cent, on 15s. to ordinary share-
holders ; afterwards, in proportion to the amounts paid
on shares. But unless there is a very big reduction in
expenses away from the mine and the works, divs. will
come slowly. Last year, in the teeth of continued disas-
ter, the directors took £2412, “general expenses”
amounted to £6469, advisers’ fees to £2420, travelling ex-
penses to £3B2—and so on. Sulphides won’t stand that.
It is interesting to compare the reports of the
companies owning the neighboring mines, the B.H-
Central and B.H. South, once worked together. The
South Australian-owned, furnishes the most skeietonic
information. It gives shareholders absolutely no idea of
the sort of work the ore-dressing machinery is doing ; it
doesn’t tell them what the ore assays, and what the con-
centrates assay ; so that the plant may be failing to re-
cover two-thirds of the metal —their metal for all share-
holders know to the contrary. The Central, owned by
the Sulphide Corporation, furnishes elaborate state-
ments, giving assay-values with much detail—with more
detail, In fact, than any other Barrier co. During
the co.’s last half-year 81,632 tons was concentrated,
15,526 tons concentrates were produced. The ore assayed
12’700z. silver, 18'20 per cent, lead, and 22 - 90 per cent,
zinc The value of the concentrates was 30Toz. silver,
65-3 per cent, lead, aiid 9’3 per cent. zinc. Of course
there are also “zincs” (5183 tons, assaying 10'9oz. silver,
9-3 per cent, lead, and 32'5 per cent, zinc), seconds,
“middlings,” and so on. Of lead the recovery now
amounts to 70 per cent. The lode has been opened to a
width of over 180 ft. Mr. Aug. Raht, an American en-
gineer, whom the co engaged to report and ad vine, adopts
tiie estimate of 2,500,000 tons of ore above the 600 ft. level.
And as at the 700 ft. the lode ought to be still wider, this
is probably the world’s record sulphide deposit.
B.H. South has issued the reports and accounts
for its record half-year ; the record part of the transaction
being due to the strong lead-market. Of course, a great
deal of the value of the financial statements is lost
through the values of shipments being merely estimates ;
for on the one side we have an actual outlay, and on the
other some figures which a sudden market movement
might make a mess of. However, down to date the
South’s estimates have been conservative. On this basis,
then—take it for what it is worth—a profit of £24,579 has
been made according to working account; but, making
deductions for management and depreciation, £20,572 is
left. Of this, £20,000 went in dive., and £572 was added
to the amount taken forward. Why, however, the
depreciation allowance is this half-year fixed at
£2902 while for the preceding half it was £6231
is not clear. The financial position appears to be ap-
proximately this : Concentrates on hand, including dumps
(what dumps?), £11,240 ; supplies on hand, £3047 ; cash,
£9391 ; and sundry debtors, £369 ; total, £24,047. Sundry
creditors, 6120—over-called, £447 ; total, £6567. Sur-
plus, £17,480. But the importance of these last figures
depends largely upon the concentrates-on-hand item. If
the zinc tailings are included, then just for the present it
isn’t worth much. Even apart from this, though, the
financial position was never better.

The Sydney-owned Pinnacles (silver) co., near

Mr. D. L. Doolette to Thk Bulletin from Kal-
goorlie : “The Great Boulder was never a ‘cat;’ the
lodes now being worked outcropped on the N. side of
Boulder Hill, and were known to the prospectors ; that
thev missed the outcrop on the south side was not to be
wondered at, seeing that when O’Neil found and followed
it, it was a stringer only for nearly 100 ft. I affirm the
Boulder was always a legitimate venture, but that it
suffered in public opinion and consequently in the
market, through the attacks of prejudiced and in-
competent ‘ experts ’ who came looking for quartz,
and, finding it not, declared gold could not exist
without it. As to the cheapness of the shares,
were not those of the Lake View at a few shillings for
months after Sandford had discovered the now famous
lode, and demonstrated its size and richness in the old
open cut? Manv experts, a warden among them, de-
clared that the rich ‘ mustard gold,’ which came from the
oxidation of tellurides and was so marked a feature in
this lode and the ones worked by Brookipan on the 8.,
was not gold at all, but clay ; and it was the circulation
of these opinions that kept the shares low in the market.
As for being ‘ in the know,’ I was camped on the mine for
months from the time of its inception, was down its work-
ings daily, and often in Brockman’s absence showed the
visiting experts over it; while most of those who con-
demned it were on it for a few hours only, and some were
never nearer than Coolgardie.”
• * * •
Broad Arrow has an extraordinary lead—a
genuine creek-bed —water-worn pebbles and big rocks
quite smooth, and rough, jagged gold laying right on
the bottom, as a rule ; looks as if it hadn’t travelled an
inch. No telling which way water ran. Prospectors’
shaft bottomed at 36ft., close alongside another at 45ft. ;
on opposite side is one at 14ft. ; alongside this again, one
at 60ft. Too much dead work to get a thin seam of gold-
bearing wash, and patchv at that. Battery returns
mostly unsatisfactory. About six payable claims on
whole lead, and half these nearly washed out.
• * * *
Brookman’s Boulder directors, at the share-
holders’ meeting in London, remarked unreservedly that
they thought they deserved great praise for their
economy. Gold won was worth £5078 ; and —instances
of the economy—directors’ fees were £6OO, law expenses
£154, office expenses £6BO, and so on. The co. actually
spent on cables alone more than half the Bendigo co.’s
spend on management in half a year. But then a good
many Bendigo mines pay.

“ Plunderderry ” Gold Mines Action by ven-
dors claiming ±150,000 for delay in the issue of their
(116,667-) shares—compromised by payment of £7BOO.
Last report says : “ This settlement has removed a peril
of some magnitude from the future of the co.” Lord Fin-
gall admitted that, when he secured the mine, he gave an
undertaking that these shares should be issued within one
month after the co. came out, but Col. North, who “ was.
strongly impressed that, there had been fraud on the part
of those gentlemen, if not on the part of Mr. Myring and
myself, was opposed to paying over anything that he
could possibly avoid paying over.” No settlement for
these shares was allowed on the Stock Exchange, so, alto-
gether, vendors were unable to sell while they were at a
premium, and, when they got them, they were selling at
less pence than they were once worth shillings. They
have the doleful consolation of taking £7BOO, most of it,
no doubt, eaten up in costs. The £50,000 working-
capital has been reduced to £4OOO ; reconstruction-
scheme to call up more working - capital and
to reduce the abnormal capital, postponed. Fingall
said that some French shareholders disapproved of the
proposal to reconstruct. Paris took a lot of shares at a
premium after the exhibition there of “ big Ben ” and
other specimens, on the gold of which “ you could hang
your hat.” “One gentleman,” said Fingall, “sent us a
proxy in which he says all of us directors should be in the
dock. We may have made mistakes, but we did our best.
A man cannot do better than his best.” Best for what ?
To make a mine for shareholders or to make money for
themselves? Myring said it had always been the inten-
tion of Fingall and himself to hand over their profits to
be dealt with by two trustees, and suggested a committee
to consult with’ Fingall and himself as to the best way of
putting their desires into effect. Satisfactory, so far as it
goes, but when is it coming off ? Refunding of promotion
profits has been talked about for three years.

Vic. mining men are amazed at the cost of
running co.’s in London such as the Great Boulder, Lake
View Consols and Associated Mines. Suggested that some
balance-sheets of Vic. mining co.’s might be distributed
amongst shareholders in London. South Germah—half-
year divs. £25,200. Seventy-six per cent, of gold won
distributed in divs. and total cost of management, £607,
or less than 2J per cent. If owned in London manage-
ment would eat up as many thousands as hundreds in
Vic. and what sort of management ! Lansell lets off his
biggest snort when asked to take shares in a London co. in

From Watsonville, N.Q. : The official report
for ’9B shows that this place has produced tin valued at
over £3OOO for the year—sold at about £3O per ton.
Twenty men raised this, which means that each averaged
£lO a year more than current rate of wages. Taking tin
at present Sydney quotations, it means that, locally, tin
is just 100 per cent, higher than this time last year, so
that tin-mining is now even more profitable than any
gold-mine worked hereabouts. The local mines are
operated most unsystematically. The low prices paid
for the metal during the past few years caused
the miner, who solely depended on his labor, to scoop
the eyes out of the lode, leaving the poor ore ; the
shows are now practically worked to the end of their
tether, and need a little capital judiciously spent. That
forthcoming, the field would be a tin dividend-paying
centre, prosperous and reasonably permanent.

The late Dick Craven made a pile in the ’BB
boom on the Towers. He was one of the few who, kept

When it’s the market and not the mine, thank the Lord
if you’ve an honest broker,”
Most of the capital now leaving London for
Australasian mines is going into those of Vic., where
quite a number of shareholders’ meetings are called to
consider offers. Mineowners in Vic. are not quite so
greedy as elsewhere. In Victoria, mining being more of
a business and less of a mere gamble, properties, as a
rule, are better developed ; and, above all, in most cases
owners are ready to join hands on a working-capital basis,
for which in some instances two-thirds of the mines are
given. ...
From a national as well as from a provin-
cial standpoint does there not seem solid reason in the
contention of Donald Clark, C.E., of Baimsdale, that
restrictions should be put on the dredging and sluiCr
ing companies’ proposed operations on Gippsland rivers r
Clarke, who is director of Baimsdale school of mines,
declares that dredging the streams for alluvial will result
in the polluting of the water and the silting up of adjacent
arable flats. Thus it is possible that gold may be won
very dearly at the cost of agriculture. Also, as Clark
points out, the system of big co’s taking up and exhaust-
ing alluvial fields is detrimental to the prospector who
relies on alluvial for tucker whilst quartz-fossicking. Ip
fact, quartz-mining is the legitimate field for investors,
and the prospector deserves his modicum of alluvial for
the services he renders the community by keeping away
from the ranks of city unemployed and by pioneering
auriferous country for his own and the common weal,
’. Johnson’s Reef, Bendigo Admitted at recent
meeting that the co. had about a million tons, of tailings
worth an average of two dwts., but these could not be
pavahly treated by present appliances. Probably too
large a proportion of coarse gold in them for economical
cyanidation. * • •
Crown Lyell, Tas. Writ issued in Melb.
claiming £75,000 damages for non-performance of contract
for the sale of the mine.
A smart gold-stealing trick is placed to the dis-
credit of a now prosperous Northern publican. Years ago
the publican was a humble faceman working in a rich
alluvial mine for his 7s. 6d. a shift. One night when on
afternoon shift, Blank hooked out a spanking nugget.
His mate was up the drive at the time, hanging the crib
billies over the candles. Blank promptly rolled the
nugget in the old shirt he had taken off and trampled it
into the slurry on the floor of the drive. Just before
knock-qff he shovelled the shirt with its precious con-
tents into a truck of mullock. The truck of mullock
went up, and was tipped, and when things were quiet,
Blank raked up that shirt again off the mullock-tip', and
was the richer for a 160 oz. nugget.

When toul-air is suspected in a mining shaft
everybody around makes the same suggestion—“ Lower a
light.” But the candle-test was always a rough one, and,
as candles are made now, is in these days rougher than
ever. The other day two miners got into carbonic acid
gas at Stawell, Vic.,' and were killed on the spot; and
still the candle burned. The doctor at the inquest took
some pains to dissipate the belief in the old test; but the
veterans present shook their beards, and will, no doubt,
“send down the light” as usual. And, anyhow, it is
better than nothing. What is necessary is to take pre-
cautions even after the test gives a favorable answer.

Strange ideas seem to obtain at Govern-
ment House, Sydney, as to the etiquette of flag-
flying. The “ rag ”is rarely hauled down at sun-
set, and generally remains flying during the night,
a »d m the early mornings prior to 8 o’clock (at
which hour all respectable ensigns first make their
appearance) it may be seen hanging dejectedly,
and looking like many another who has spent the
night on the tiles.” When a German princelet
dies, whose father draws some thousands a year
from the British, whose nationality he has long
since renounced, behold the flag at half-mast for
days, and all the Govt, offices following l suit.
Meantime the flags on the great German liner at
Circular Quay fly fairly at the masthead ! ! On
oaturday, while both German and French mail
liners signified in the usual way their sympathy
with France in the loss of the President of the
Republic, the flag at Government House was not
lowered ; nor did any of the Government offices
pay a compliment which was only bare inter-
national courtesy.

A little story of N.S. Wales’ little pill
Beauchamp when he was Mayor of Great Britain
and Ireland, or something of the kind. He was
asked to take the chair at some small local func-
tion, and declined. “ The actions of a man in
my position, he replied, “ must not be derogatory
to the national dignity.” The Bulletin will con-
trive to be present when this nice young man is
asked to open his first Sydney dog-show or Little
-Bethel bazaar. Ten to one ere he has been in
Sydney a week he will be asked to preside at the

South Australia has had two bachelor
Governors. Major Robe, who followed Hori Grey,
more than half-a-eentury ago and who was
extremely unpopular, and Sir William Cairns,
brother of the then Lord Chancellor of England,
who only stopped in Adelaide from March to May,
’77. S. A. has only seen one Governor’s marriage,
that of Sir .Tames Fergusson, whose first wife (a
daughter of Lord Dalhousie) died in the province
and who married Miss Richman, daughter of a
local squatter.

Lord Tennyson will arrive in Adelaide
about Easter Monday ; and Onkaparinga racing
club is already trying to get him for its yearly
fixture at Oakbank on that day. It is said that
little Lieut.-Gov. Way is utilising weeks of
convalescence in reading up the late Laureate’s
poems, so that he may at once pour them over the
devoted head of the son.
According to an “ own correspondent ” in
London, Baron Tennyson’s children are all poeti-
cal. On top of this comes the information that
the new Governor’s party will consist of 30 persons.

Latest information shows that Lord
Tennyson has a taste for golf and yacht-
ing, and his other chief delight lies in the con-
struction of English hexameters. The news is
bewildering to Adelaide society. The only local
“ goff ” club, although a fashionable affair, is far
from flourishing ; and yachting is almost unknown
in uppah-class circles. One or two of the gilded
have at different times bought expensive uniforms
and braved the choppy waters of St. Vincent’s
Gulf, but they invariably got so dreadfully side
that the pastime was quickly abandoned.

It must come as a shock to a man when the
wife of his bosom dies and her will discloses that
she wants to be buried atop of the bones of a
former husband. Something like this happened
lately, when a Cornish lady left .£38,000 odd and
a will in which “the testatrix desired that her
body should be buried in the grave of her former
husband, Mr. Benjamin Darley, of St. Jude’s,
Randwick, N.S.W.” But she apparently didn’t
bequeath much except her bones to Australia.

N.S.W. Supreme Court Judges went
through the stereotyped formality of taking their
seats on the Bench in full regalia at the opening
of Term, the other day. Multi-colored robes and
full-bottomed wigs played the usual part, and the
jury-box was packed with admiring females. The
scene resembled a party intent on amateur thea-
tricals more than on sober and in most cases
painful justice. And several barristers, suffi-
ciently raree-looking in their native state, smirked
and bobbed under brand-new wigs. Apropos of
Judges’ and barristers’ wigs, no law, convention,
or Parliament ever conferred this head-gear on
the legal body. The British public in the time of
Charles 11. took to wearing wigs generally, in
imitation of a French fashion then in vogue. Soon
laymen dropped the custom. Next bishops and
clergy threw the wigs off and went about in their
own hair. But barristers and Judges stuck and
stick to the wigs, as if they were fees or dignity.
At a recent Australian wedding, in which
a certain millionaire figured as bridegroom, and a
deceased wife’s sister as bride, a photograph of
the first wife stood during the ceremony on an
easel, in a prominent position, draped in white
silk. The pleasing innovation attracted much
attention.

linotypes and other type-machines come down in price,
there will scarcely be a solitary hand-setting comp, in

“ Before Australia starts ‘ motor-carring ’

the frightful waste of two - thirds of the
stored power. A new motor—the Molas—is to
reduce this to a tenth, and to drive ’buses or
bicycles under easy control. Next month a ’bus

The Rev. Nairn’s lecture, “to ladies

sounds ferocious, but was comparatively mild.
The most startling item on the programme was a
hymn in which each woman pled
for “a thousand tongues.” Under
which circumstances it was, per-
haps, just as well that the old
man was absent. For the rest,
the lecture was the usual demand
for the women of this land to
arise and demand something hazy
or something unspecified. Also,
the lecturer advised the budding
womanhood of Australia to choose
its husband from among men of
pure and stainless character,
but- didn’t mention where the
regulation amount of stainless
man was to be obtained. But,
to the average female, all
this haziness was lost in the
general delightful fact that
Woman is a Power!
Strange how it is always
the girl with the drab
complexion and unsym-
metrical teeth who is most
convinced that Woman is
a Power. The fact is, wo-
men don’t influence men
any more than they are influenced
by them. Woman’s influence only
seems more because it is relatively
more in proportion to her physi-
cal and mental health. Yet
men are not convened in large
assemblies to be told how to
exercise a moral and elevat-
ing influence on their wives

The average Melbourne man in street,
train, or tram has begun to remark that no other
community in the world would have allowed the
Dungey-Dora trap to effect a conviction of the
trapped parties—abortionists or no abortionists.
Furthermore, the average citizen wants to know,
in an undertone, why the Dungeyites cant lay
traps for certain rich and influential abortionists,
if the Law is honestly desirous of suppressing the
traffic in illegal practices. A raid upon certain
private hospitals and lying-in places would reveal
evidences of successful abortion any day of the
month. But having remarked that the Melb.
community is a slavish community where the
Crown Law Department and policemen are con-
cerned, each individual slave reckons that the
duty of raising a disturbance ought to devolve
upon everybody except himself. He is just as
docile now as when he permitted the boomtime

Writer was sitting on the Red Bluff
at St. Kilda on a warm afternoon. Some children
were playing on the sand. Their father descended
with a wooden box on his shoulder, evidently a
box of provisions with a view to tea on the beach.
But a smart youth on a rock bawled : “ Wot yer
got in yer boot-box, Guv’nor?” Thereupon the

A Melb. man, suing on be-
half of his 11-year-old boy, recently
recovered <£lo in the County Court
from a next-door neighbor, whose St.
Bernard had bitten the child. It was
alleged that on a previous occasion
the dog had bitten someone. The case
calls attention to the peculiar state
of the law with regard to dog-bite. If you _
sue in the Supreme or County (District) Court
you have to prove that this isn’t the animal s
first offence; these courts hold that a dog is legally
entitled to “his first bite.” But if you sue in the
police-court Toby is not entitled to a bite at all,
and the First Dog Offences Act doesn t apply.
Another view : Thekla Dubberke, the one
interesting figure in the Melb. boot-trunk story, is
a girl to shudder at, or to admire, ihe
“horror” that her candid admissions has
excited is a bogus sentiment, perhaps.
Woman’s nature is more practical than
man’s, but her nervous weaknesses serve to
present her to the “sterner” sex in a false
light, as a rule. When frightened she
screams, sobs, and is a natural liar.
Thekla D. has no nervous weaknesses.
As a practical woman she did her
level best to preserve her friends
and herself from trouble in connec-
tion with the death of Mabel Am-
brose, but when she found that
trouble was bound to come she did
her level best to get out of it.
She has the courage of her
opinions on sexual “ immor-
ality,” and she shames the devil
by telling the truth cheerfully.
A magnificently honest crea-
ture !

You couldn’t throw a
brick along Melb. Block with-
out injuring the corns of some
half-dozen pensioners on the
bleeding country. The Aus-
tralasian has just published a
photo, of the hallowed spot
where the frisky Melbournian
with the long hair and the short
dress meets her “boy,” and in
the long line of diminishing
figures no less than 14 pensioners
can be picked out. The whiskers
of the Premier’s secretary, who
once (vide the local Herald) averted
a sanguinary war between Britain
and France, off his own bat,
shine beautifully at the head of the
Legion that ever is Listed.

Sydney’s new regiment, the “ Thirty
Bobbers,’ whose uniform is dirty-looking yellow
kharkee, should be “ all right ”in war. The corps
should consist solely of patriotic warriors who
really do want to fight, inasmuch as surely no one
but a frenzied lover of his native land would be
seen in so disreputably-” clobbered ” a force.
Which suggests that it would 'be well to test the
patriotism of the aged and decrepit fire-eaters
who comprise the gorgeously-arrayed N.S.W.
“ National Guard ” by taking away their present
gaudy scarlet uniform, and decking ’em out in
short shellback jackets, slouch hats, and roomy
moleskin-pants with large greenhide patches in
the rear. This is a scheme which should recom-
mend itself to a lover of cheapness like Premier
Reid. Such “ uniforms ” wouldn’t even cost “30
bob,” and probably none of them would be
wanted.

Enchanting item for witnesses in justice-
courts. At Ballarat police-court recently an old
man, sworn, was observed to have a tumor on his
lip, and as he admitted this to be cancerous,
the book was promptly destroyed. Little right
have we, while the barbarous and dangerous book-
swearing custom is retained, to sneer at the
mumbo-jumbo of the “ savage.”
Vic. farmers’ wive# in the
hay-districts slam the door in

“ Not this morning, thank yo!”

should we encourage them when they don’t

Melancholy comment on Australia’s meat-
mania is supplied by a telegram from Cunning-
hame (Vic.): “ The salmon-fishing is improving,
but prices are so variable that the fishermen some-
times lose on their consignments. Last week, a
crew sent 600 baskets for a net return of £37. The
first 200 baskets sold involved loss.” Meat grows
dearer, whilst fish forwarded inland fails to realise
even freight.

“ Catapult” to The Bulletin :
I am a glazier by profession, but have long wooed pub-
lic patronage with little success. It may be that iny
manners are unpleasing, that iny putty is not properly
mixed, or that mv glass does not charm the public eye.
Whatever the cause, the fact is plain enough. I am,
therefore, driven to advertise, but here comes an obstacle.
Glazing is a profession, not a “ trade,” and is hedged
round by numberless provisions calculated to keep its
dignity up to concert pitch. The etiquette of the pro-
fession says that I must not advertise, and those gentle-
men who do so are denounced as quacks. Now, I don’t
want to be called a quack, and, moreover, I don’t wish to
pay for advts. at 6s. an inch in the Sydney dailies. So I
want, to know if the dailies will give me the use of several
columns of their reading space per week to discuss such
a question, sav, as “Do Australians use enough
windows ? ” If you could give me a column or two every
week I’d feel much obliged. lam willing to take either
side of the controversy, and some brother glazier, also in
need of bold advt., would come forward and contradict
me at great length to keep up the public interest. Actors
and others do this, and I don’t see why glaziers shouldn’t.
The question whether Australians use enough windows,
or whether they break their windows often enough, is one
which plainly requires ventilation.

The stolidity during his trial with which
one or two Sydney dailies credited Briggs, who
killed his sweetheart and her grandmother at
Petersham, Sydney, was but another instance of
the boy-reporter’s proneness to transfer to the
observed a leading characteristic of the mind with
which he observes it. Briggs’ face throughout the
trial marvellously cinematographed his mind;
every feature proclaiming his thoughts, so that a
deaf and dumb observer might have read upon
him a graphic account of the proceedings as they
progressed. A net-work of nerves indicated every-
thing ; and lips, chin, eyes, brows, and even ears
and nose were continually in motion, as if the de-
stroyer of Maggie Binud Dutt and Margaret
Miller were continuously re-enacting in his mind
what he terms “ the outrageous deed.”
“ Cassio ” to The Bulletin :
In sentencing ex-artilleryman Briggs to death, Judge
Cohen asserted that when committing the murder
Briggs knew right from wrong. But it is not probable
that the notions Right or Wrong ever entered Briggs’
mind after the first pang of jealousy. Jealousy is a
primal force of nature, which once thoroughly aroused in
a vigorous and active temperament is of all passions the
least subject to the influences of morality or reason. We
go to the theatre to see “ Othello.” The noble Moor falls
overwhelmingly in love with the gentle Desdemona. He
disregards proprieties and elopes with her like a romantic
bor and surreptitiously marries her. Neither lover
thinks of the Right or Wrong of it. They think of on*
another before all else. A common stable-boy anil a pretty
chambermaid might act just the same any day. But the
noble Moor I He Is Othello—and we are at the play 1
Next, Othello takes the cue for jealousy from lago, and,
finally, the Moor calls Desdemona a , locks himself
in with her and murders her. No stableman could use a
worse word towards a virtuous wife, and no cowardl
larrikin could be more oowardly than to lock himself n a
room with a defenceless woman for the purpose of killing
her. Yet, when the curtain falls, we find ourselves, like
Coleridge, “ not knowing whom to pity most, innocent
Desdemona or the broken-hearted Moor.” we feel that
way because the characters in the play are remote from
us in time and place. We thus Judg* Othello impar-
tially, and we pity him. Yet Othello, the l)pe
of manliness, could not be mere abjeot than
when he is listening to the insinuations of
Iago; playing spy or eavesdropper; heaping vile
insults on Desdemona; or, finally, smothering, her
to death. But the Moor has our sympathy be-
cause we are in the position to be impartial.
With Briggs and Miss Dutt the case is very dif-
ferent. They belong to us. There is no martial glamor
about the name of Briggs—no romantic beauty in the
monosyllabic appellation of Dutt. We pity Miss Dutt,
and feel tired while saying so. And Othello Briggs—on,
well, Judge Cohen looks over his “ portly belly, and
sentences Briggs to be hanged by the neck until dead,
and then goes home like the rest of us to dinner.

“M.H.F.” on Queensland police failures :
The failure of the Q. police to fathom Gatton and
Oxley tragedies recalls other cases of similar ineptitude.
For instance : Some few years ago, one Jarvis and wife,
after marketing at Maryborough, left on their return
home in a spring-cart, and were seen on the road —a much
frequented one—by several persons. A few hours later,
they were found brutally murdered at the slip-rails of
their selection, only a few miles from town, and within
sight of their house. The man had evidently been
bludgeoned whilst sitting in the cart, and, from appear-
ances, the woman was killed whilst in the act of taking
down the slip-rails. The murderer or murderers were
never discovered, and the matter remains a mystery to
this day. But mark how the police satisfied themselves
that it was useless to pursue investigation further. Just
about the time of the murder, a kanaka stole a boat from
a place near by, made out to sea, and was heard of no
more, and the police at once concluded that hei must
have been the assassin though there was no evidence
whatever to connect him with the tragedy. No kanaka
was seen about the scene of the murder, nothing was
stolen, and, as the woman did not seem to have been
outraged, it is hard to assign a reason for assuming that
this kanaka was guilty of attacking inoffensive people
like the Jarvis’s. Then there is the fact that, in no out-
rage in Queensland where kanakas have been concerned,
has an attack been made single-handed, and it is there-
fore only reasonable to suppose that, even if the escaped
kanaka was implicated in the murder, he was not alone.
Who were his confederates? The investigation by the
police in this case was a regular botch.

and the voice of the W.O.T.U. is loud in the land.
So when a S.A. husband skipped ever the border
into N.S.W. and forgot the trifling circumstance
that he had a wife and five children down the line,
and went on forgetting it for five years, the
Destitute Department put its hand out and
brought him back, and a Police Court awarded
him nine months’ hard. How the sentence is
going to improve the position of the wife and five
children isn’t clear; but as a plan for the en-
couragement of others it has advantages.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A fair face radiant with the infinite charm
Of womanhood awakened. Eyes that tease
With unimaginable sweetnesses
Of pfrtial promise ; yet as strangely calm
As Mary mother’s. Then, a dimpled arm
That’s strong to hew down hearts with. Add to these
A perfect mouth ; a bosom that would please
A wiser Paris, to the Queen’s alarm.
No artist I to limn in faultless phrase
The beauties of that lady whom 1 laud,
Whose loveliness would task a Master s art.
What cares she, nestling warmly to my heart?

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
, , Sydney, February 21, 1899.
My Dear Myee—
In more ways than one the prize-giving to P.A.
Hospital nurses was a frisky ceremony. His Ex.
arrived in a blue shirt, and was seen to look down
his nose when Prof. Anderson Stuart—to whom,
by the way, twins were born the other day—began
the usual regrets at losing Lord and Lady Hamp-
den. So many of these regrets have been ad-
dressed to y’Excellency and Lady ’Ampden that
his Ex. couldn’t exactly pretend he was sorry to
be going back to dine and ‘ ‘ goff ” among people who
would pronounce Hampden with an “11 ” : but he
gently and jocosely hinted that he might come
back some day in a “ private capacity ! ” Seeing
that this all happened at the Hospital, where
jokes are allowed to be grim, “ Gouli ” guesses that
the private capacity will be as a spook; who
would, naturally, not find this beastly Sydney
climate quite so tryin’.
Also, naturally, the end of the Hampden regime
sees many weird flowers of speech shooting up
painfully from desert places. Every little or big
meeting blessed by their Exes.’ presence blooms
out into raw valedictory sentiments that must give
the speakers awful aches. Lady Hampden takes
it all beautifully, never allowing that tired look to
dull the graciously-smiling countenance, and his
Ex. looks like a good, bland martyr, but daughters
Dolly and Alice have been seen to shuffle boredly
in their seats with the restlessness of youth that
won’t swallow what it doesn’t like. Of the suite,
the aides deserve the most pity, and the loudest
praise, for all this oft-exploding gas isn’t about
themselves. Major Bryan, whose resemblance to
the fatal Julius would do havoc if it were left out
long in Sydney, keeps a round, unamused mouth
through all the fearful aldermanic struggle, and,
as for Capt. Feilden, he draws a kind of wooden
veil over his pensive face, and stares into the far
comer of the ceiling with absolutely no expression
whatever.
To return to the Hospital, Hamp-
den, in an elegant black lace over white silk,
gave away smiles and books to the fresh-faced
nurses, and was seen to be particularly inter-
ested _in the Bed - making Winners. Possibly,
experience has taught her Ex. that bed-making
isn't an inherited “colonial ” talent, for the Austra-
lian slavey who can make a bed of roses out of
mere sheets, blankets and mattress, be the
treasure that is laid up elsewhere. English
servants have a knack of turning out an unruffled
quilt surface, correctly tucked in, and turned over,
and smoothed down; but when the local house-
maid wants to be superior she runs over her bed
with the handle of the broom that just swept up
the scullery, and, as a forcible society dame re-
marked to ’er li’Emma, “ I didn’t see you do it,
h’Emmer, but I smelled it.”
Speaking of prizes, a N.S. W. girl has just carried
off a medal for going to Sunday School every
blessed Sabbath day for ten years; so that virtue
isn’t left to be its own reward in these irrev’rent
provinces, and we aren’t as irreligious as we’re
painted. In England they are putting quite a
different kind of market value on religion. I was
reading, the other day, about that jolly young
Oxford man who hanged himself in his bedroom,
for no reason that anyone could discover. When
his mother was called in to give evidence,
she made the peculiar statement that “ Tommy
was neither in debt, in disgrace, nor out-of-the-
way religious in fact, had no possible cause for
suicide. Fin-de-siecle, if you like.
Re all the gaieties that are still rejuvenating old
Hobart Town, Sydney has formulated a big sore
spot. Why didn’t the Admiral give balls for
Sydney girls? The few mild garden-parties to
which Sydney society has been invited at its own
Admiralty House have turned quite a sallow green
in comparison with the gaudy balls and regattas
the Hobart girls are getting. Besides, who wants
to be asked to a garden-party ? It’s a function in-
vented expressly for the suburban people, who
somehow look less inaccurate in the vegetable
setting of a garden, and for clergy.
However, Sydney’s own gay time is coming.
Easter is not going to be a whited sepulchre, after
all, for three big balls are talked about for race-
week. _ One is semi-official, one semi-private, and
the third—well, the awful exclusiveness of a toney
club-dance baffles description of the third.
For these festivities some lovely ball-dresses
arrived in Sydney the other day. I had a peep at
them at Webb and Co.’s, where they are being
kept out of the full glare of the public’s eye. They
are all embroidered nets —some black, some white.
On the net lesthetic patterns are thickly worked in
steel or black pailette, and the skirts are shaped
in the latest style, clinging to the hips, and sweep-
ing out below the knees. Anyone whose dreams
are rose-colored will go into ecstasies over a black
robe worked in rose-and-amethyst-tinted spangles,
thrown artfullv over a length of rich rose silk. A
white tulle embroidered in a long up-running pat-
tern of steel is another creation calculated to turn
other people than the wearer green.
The marriage of Mrs. Wolstenholme and Pro-
fessor Anderson is fixed for March 3. The bride-
groom will be the third Prof, who has succumbed
within a year to the present matrimonial epidemic.
There are now left but two bachelor professors be-
longing to Sydney University—Prof. Scott
(Greek) and Prof. Liversidge (Chemistry), and it
is believed that the former intends to go into
hiding for a few years to try to escape the
marriage-plague. Mrs. Wolstenholme will resign
the secretaryship of the Teachers’ Registry, Miss
Garran taking her place, and will devote to litera-
ture any spare time she may have after starting
the Prof, off in time for lectures. Later on this
interesting couple will travel.
Ihe fashionable days for weddings this year so
far have been Jan. 4, Feb. 2, March I—almost1 —almost as
regular as an arithmetical procession. It is
surprising that in these days, when the High
Church party is said to be coming into power, so
many weddings should take place in Lent. Miss
Lingen, of Darling Point, is to be married to Mr.
Merewether on March Ist. Miss Prosser, Miss
Horton, I?.Sc., and Mrs. Wolstenholme follow
shortly after. It is sad that the Hampdens will
be out of all these doings.
A determined young man, well-known in chess
and literary circles, got married the other day.
The girl’s father has for long objected to the
bridegroom (whom, it is said, he has never even
seen), and so the other day the young couple were
united without his knowledge.
Next month almost all who are not newly
married and many who are will start on their
travels. A girl who has many friends and whose
year’s allowance is gone already in providing
presents for them, was heard to observe the other
day that it would be almost as cheap to go for a
trip as to stay in Sydney buying presents every
day.
I notice that the craze for getting all the
wedding-presents into print shows no signs of
Ilyins' a decent death. I came across the notice
of an Australian wedding the other day—he
was a bank-clerk, and she was the seventh daughter
of a local doctor—and the list of what people
gave them covered three long columns. To be sure
among the presents was recorded “the wedding
breakfast,” by the mother of the bride (which
rather suggests a spinning-out of copy on the
bride’s part), and various little things, like ‘ ‘ two
hat-pins from Mr. and Mrs. Jones, a very valu-
able Langshan fowl from Mrs. and the Misses
Brown, photograph of Mr. Dobson’s pony, ” which
somehow reads cruelly, don’t you think? People
who don’t send cheques as gifts have been heard
to explain that there’s no fun in doing so, because
the cheques are not placed on view among the
other presents in the drawing-room, and the
general impression of the wedding-guests is that
the cheque-writers are to be looked down on for
having given nothing. But the matter is simplified
now. A little list of money-donators is hung up
in a glass frame, where nobody can miss it, and
the cheque-givers can hold up their heads with
hat-pins, butter-knives, and the photos, of ponies.
How’s tliis for near ? In the railway tram, the
other day, an old man passed up two tram-tickets,
one blue, valued at a penny, one red, valued at
three fardens. These were handed up the seat,
until they came into the black kid glove of a well-
dressed old lady of some seventy summers. When
they arrived at her she clutched them, fingered
them for a second, and examined them for a second
through her specs. Then she opened her purse
and took out two red railway tram-tiokets (valued
at three farthings each). She leaned forwards, and
smiled ingratiatingly at the gentleman whose fare
she was handling. Then she whispered to him
soothingly, “I’ll give you a red ticket for a blue,”
passed up two reds, pocketed a blue, and made a
farden on the bold transaction. The humor—if
you like to call it so—of the little scene lay in the
faces of two fat schoolboys who might have ac-
complished the same brilliant stroke of biz if they
had only thought of it.
Some pitiful exhibitions of meanness of spirit
were lately given in letters to the Melb. Argus.
A governess earning -£3O per annum supplied the
paper with an interesting balance-sheet, showing
how she laid out her money. The items included
“fruit and sweets, ss. Bd.,”and “literature, sta-
tionery, music, 7s. 9d.” Thereupon an indignant
female writes to the paper with the censure that
“ Penelope seems to indulge in many luxuries, such
as fruits, sweets, literature, presents, church and
charity.” Many luxuries ! ss. Bd. a year on fruit
and sweets comes to less than fid. a month. Saint
Skinflint! How the person who would object to a
girl spending that amount on sweets must shudder;
at the thought of throwing away the skin of a
grape !
There was an overflow attendance at the lecture
by that English educational magnate, Sir Evelyn
Oakley, last Friday night. Practically the whole
educational world of Sydney assembled at the
bidding of “Margaret Hodge and Harriet New-
comb ” (such is the up-to-date manner in which
the invitations were issued). It is doubtful
whether the audience felt as much interested in
the lecturer’s dates and percentages as they did in
Mr. Reid’s efforts at the close. The Premier
remarked that he felt quite certain he would have
occasionally taken a prize at school had the system
of.training teachers then been in vogue; also, he
said he had not slept once during the lecture —and
several other things which sounded hideously
funny at the close of such a highly respectable
discourse.
Every now and then, moved by a strange, inex-
plicable fancy, a wave of one particular character
sweeps round the theatres. One time every-
body will be playing Napoleon, Hamlet, Lady
Teazle, Rosalind. Just now the “ Three Muske-
teers ” are the fashion in England, and “Juliet ” is
our own classic city’s fancy. No less than three
Juliets have threatened within a fortnight to ask
“Wherefore art thou Romeo?” The first to
come into the balcony was Miss Helene Burdette,
at the hotly-crowded benefit to the little M‘Mahon
Brothers. She leaned over the balcony in white,
and her hair fell into her mouth, and not a word
could you hear in the circle. Unfortunately, this
was not the case with Romeo as Mr. W. H. Diver,
who gave no explanation whatever of the reason
of Juliet’s passion for him. Not even poor, plain
Bill ’Olloway cut such a sorry figure as an Italian
gentleman in red plush.
The benefit, by the way, must have been highly
successful. In spite of the melting night, every
seat and stray chair was solidly filled. Among the
audience I noticed Mme. Emily Spada—whose
bright, kindly face looks nicer the nearer you get
to it —and every pretty amateur-budding profes-
sional actress, in Sydney. The mixed programme
wasn’t a tower of strength all the way down.
Ernest Toy’s violin solo was a gem of the first
water, limpid and reflective, and where most boy-
ish, most emotional. Peggy Pryde was rather put
out by an orchestra which could not find the time
she wanted, and Phil Newbury kept his best
Saturday night passion out of “ Come into the
Garden, Maud.” Perhaps the broadest theatrical
effect was laid on by Majaw Neild, who piled com-
plimentary remarks on top of a testimonial, and
handed them all over, with a poet’s grace, to the
benefited brothers. After this, you would think
anything else was unnecessary; but no ! Mr.
Diver finished up the evening’s amusement by
leading Miss Burdette to the front of the stage,
and there in good view of the audience, kissing
her ! How this was to benefit anyone, except Mr.
Diver, puzzles me.
Another Juliet was to have been Miss Gwen
Dallas, at her own benefit to-day, February 21st.
It seems that the strain and worry of getting up
the entertainment were too much for Miss Dallas,
and everything has been postponed.
The air is thick with plans for the coming cool
weather. St. Vincent’s ball is definitely fixed for
April sth at the Town Hall —the first charity
dance of the season. Friends of Mrs. Boesen, who
is leaving for a trip abroad shortly, are getting up
a farewell conversazione to this generous and
unfailing patron of all struggling musicians and
warblers. The Great Bazaar in aid of a Con-
sumptive Home believes it will come off in the
Exhibition Building in August, but has just had
its faith a little damaged by the news that the Ex-
hibition Building may be turned into baths by that
time. As far as the Press Bazaar goes, nothing
definite has been fixed on yet. One generous-
looking pen-lady has been heard valiantly offering
to swim with anyone in support of the cause, but
the balance of the press took a chill at the thought
of those baths, and is waiting, like the rest of the
world, for something certain.
All this week a Carnival is going on in aid of
St. Margaret’s Hospital. Mayoress Harris opened
the Fete in Monday’s rain, and a few words from
Dr. McCarthy helped out the ceremony. There
seem to be lots of pretty things to buy ; a table
covered with silver looked attractive ; and many
little girls in short gay frocks dance there grace-
fully every day. This hospital devotes itself to
maternity cases, and is in great need of funds, so
that a visit to the Carnival will be a worthy
charity.
I hear that the ever-popular “Tith.” has
just cabled out to the whole of the Titheradge
family to follow him “home” early in March.
Clever little Lily Tith. is wildly delighted with
the order, which is almost certain to mean a
chance for her on the London boards.
Australia is fast coming to believe in its own
good luck at Home. A private letter from Miss
Muriel Griffiths chats pleasantly of the good time
she and her sisters are having in London. Beat-
rice Griffiths finds no difficulty in getting engage-
ments at “At Homes,” and had a great time in
her tour round Scotland with Patti, who is de-
scribed as looking only about 35. Muriel Griffiths’
first violin recital in the Salle Erard was well pat-
ronised by Anglo-Australians. Her press-notices
to hand speak kindly of her fiddling, praising her
tone and technique, but noting that she played as
if under too great a control. This, by the way,
was also the drawback in Beatrice Griffiths’ play-
ing—too little suggestion of “ temperament.” The
sisters say they like London better every day,
especially the artistic life.
Speaking of letters, little Maud M‘Carthy has
just written out to her father the story of her
triumph at the New York Opera House, where
she appeared with Nordica on Christmas Eve. In
her charming, childish way she breaks the news to
him that her playing was Magnificent! Stupend-
ous ! Awfully Jolly ! Success! printing all the
enthusiastic words in big black letters that would
oatch his eye as soon as he opened the envelope.
Phil Newbury is beginning to raise the tone of
his concerts. A splendid house seems to be an
assured thing at these Saturday pops, and New-
bury has evidently no fear now that a more
elevated programme will frighten his followers
away. On Saturday M. Staell helped on the lift-
ing movement with a finely-finished Chopin-
Wilhelinj nocturne, and a Sarasate dance that
moved the house to the verge of a stormy encore.
Newbury himself is now in magnificent form, and
sang the “Star of Bethlehem” and “The Holy
City ” with a broad fervour that might, but
doesn’t—being saved by art and a great voice—
deteriorate into the style of an overblown “ Army ”
vocalist. Madame Spada joined him in the garden
duet from “Faust,” and even people who don’t
like to see “Faust” at concerts revelled in the
tender treatment he received from these artists.
But why does it always fall on M. Wiegand to
commemorate a national death ? Again the organ
was called on to yield up Chopin’s “Funeral
March to the memory of President Faure this
time—and the house testified to its deep feeling
by being unable to rise to its feet. This may be
our national way of showing respect, but the
French people present at Saturday’s concert, who
remained standing, shot withering glances at
that great self-called “Democratic” crowd which
wouldn’t stand up for a Republican President and
couldn’t sit down for Gor Save a Queen.
Is music music? If so, what is one to call a
composition entitled “ How-de-Do-De ? ” On the
cover a legend sets forth that this is the “ talk of
the town no wonder. Listen to the first verse :
“How de do de, pleasant day this evening, If we
have some rain it will bo wetl have such a pretty
song to sing you, but the words I really do forget.
How de-do-de, do-de-do-de-do-de, How de do de
do-de-do-de-do, Whack fol-de-de-do, fol-de-diddle-
di-do, How de-do-de-de-de-do-de-do.” Two
authors’ names are signed to this insult, so it
evidently took two minds to think it out.
If two men wrote “How-de-do,” what would
a whole family write? If you work it out
by Gladesville equations, you get a clue to the
deadly hatred some people manifest towards musi-
cal families.
The elasticity of the pious mind is an old story,
but a certain good young psalm-singing solicitor in
a northern city stretched his tenets an extra long
way lately. The chapel where he served as pew-
opener handed over its trust moneys to him to
invest. Looking round for a smartly profitable
spec, that would put new cushions on the com-
munion seats, furnish a new organ, and set the
chapel up generally, he met with a golden chance
in the shape of a Heathen Chinee client, willing to
pay heavy interest for a big loan. The new organ
would probably shriek agonisingly and the com-
munion cushions would turn lumpy with disgust if
they knew they had all been bought out of the
mortgage on a Chinese Joss House !
Mr. Dolman, who will be remembered as describ-
ing Sydney women at full length in an Eng-
lish magazine some little time ago, breaks out
again in the January issue of the Idler. Here we
learn that Sydney heat differs from any other
Australian heat by reason of being so dry and
healthy! and Victoria Salonites regularly picnio
up National Park way, where they make and eat
damper, and spend their time dodging 17 sorts
of snakes.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent
“ Gaunt poverty, or its semblance, is rampant
m the Seats of the Mighty at present. One hoary
pro-consul, poor soul, has dropped to the pathetic
device of paying his Antipodean bills by cheques
or drafts on London banks. Every little makes a
mucklo, ye ken, and the above practice saves his
Excellency interest or exchange, or something
or other. Another Somebody, not quite so
exalted as the pinched Patriarch just referred to,
turns a smiling face to his tormentors, and, when
his credit seems most like falling to pieces, sends
his saxpences bang with louder reports than ever.
“The inevitable has happened. One of Vic-
toria’s wealthiest daughters has ‘severed’ her
connection with the Scotchman to whom she be-
came engaged before leaving England. The bride-
groom-elect was young—so very young, indeed
that he may, perhaps, be excused for believing
that the heiress, after tasting the delights of a long
sea voyage, would really marry him. The other
day, a happy man arrived in Melbourne, expect-
ing to be made happier still. He wasn’t! He
left for his native moors per next steamer, and the
only thing left for the benevolent to hope is that
he had taken the off-chance, and provided himself
with a return-ticket. There is a big discount on
return-tickets.
“ The Campbells and other clans—also the
Governor and a big brigade of the Naicest—came
in from the suburbs to Melb. Town Hall on the
night of Maggie Sterling’s benefit, and filled every
spot, organ-seats included.
“The heroine of the hour, bonnie and winsome
as to face, big and braw as to figure, wore a hand-
some white gown, its gauzy overskirt painted with
popjnes. Her parting ditties were all pensive.
Mayor M'Eacharn, presenting Miss S. with a
bracelet from her pupils, failed to show up as any-
thing but the tritest of platitude-mongers. His
chief point was ‘the gracefulness of the donors
m allowing their teacher to take the gift away
with her.’ Among the performers was the bene-
ficiare’s pupil, Miss Jessie Nichol, a Gippsland
warbler, discovered by her teacher somewhere
near Ada Crossley’s birthplace.
“A fond relative once gave a girl of writer’s
acquaintance two guineas’ worth of ‘ Italian
atmosphere’ shut up in an ‘ammoniaphone,’ to
be inhaled daily for voice-improvement. Reci-
pient, soon tiring of personal experiment, let her
canaries nest in the box, and hoped for an extra-
tuneful brood. For the only time in her experi-
ence the chicks were all hens—not a warbler in
the whole clutch.
“Mr. L. C. Mackinnon has ostensibly several
good reasons for going ’Ome—such as his own turn
to have a holiday, his wife’s mild aversion to Aus-
tralia, and so on ; but it is suspected by some that
the fact of the Fairfax and Bonython knighthoods
has a bearing upon it. Possibly the Argus will
try for a baronetcy in view of the lead it has taken
in the Federal struggle.
“So Nina Boucicault (as was) is to marry the
widowed Mount Morganaire D’Arcy. Her name
has not been ‘ Nutting ’ in the eye of the law for a
year past, it seems. The Mrs. D’Arcy to be is a
vivacious Bananalander, not quite half-way
through her thirties. The friends of her youth
describe her as long-legged, freckled, and coltish
at fifteen. At 20 she was a belle. Later on,
though still ‘ good style, ’ she is said to have become
quite pale, tlnn and Queenslanderish, as of yore,
but from the cradle to the grave she will never be
anything but ‘good company.’ Her future step-
children are all grown up. The reigning Miss
D’Arcy is a dark, Spanish-looking damsel, the
image of her dead mother.
“One may meet in these days, on the Block, a
smart little man with a ruddy face, Parisian
beard, and spreading necktie bangled as our
grandmothers used to tie their bonnet-strings,
with ends that require a wide pavement to let
them pass. This is Carlyle Smythe, just returned
from Paris. Melbourne youth are trying to imi-
tate that necktie, but can’t manage it. No such
neckties have been seen since ‘ Bob ’ Burt shook
the dust of Melbourne out of the turned-up
bottoms of his pants.
“ They have removed (no doubt at the instance
of the W.C.T.U.) one of the stone Venuses in
Melb. Fitzroy Gardens—a very plump one—and
have put a demure damsel, with plenty of clothes
on, in her place. There is another Venus lower
down, the Medici, who vainly tries to make her
hands serve for petticoats-—but that remains, in a
nook of ivy backed by willows. The other one
was brazen in her nudity and stood close to a
bath.
“ Sex will always assert itself, ” said a political
woman at Christchurch (M.L.)duringan economic
debate a year ago. The young woman found
herself, some six months afterwards, to be one of
the “ lady reporters ” in M.L. Parliament House,
and the words of wisdom that she had uttered
were quoted as a reason why she should not be
allowed into the press-gallery. As the world
knows, she was rigidly excluded; but sex has
asserted itself despite the prudish Speaker O’Rorke
and the barriers of screens and distance that he
set up between the mere man reporters and their
petticoated rivals. “ The engagement is an-
nounced ” in Wellington of one of the fair re-
porters to one of the gallery-boys, who always
voted straight for the admission of women. The
lady is, of course, the one who declared that sex
would always assert itself !
Y ours affectionately,

“Mr. Reid has a roll in his gait.” — Melb.
paper. Mr. Reid is all rolls.
An alleged son of the late Lord Chief
Justice Coleridge of England has been sent to
Darlinghurst prison as a vagrant.
Charles Gavan Duffy now enters his 36th
year as Vic. pensioner, bearing off a total of
£36,000. He is in his 83rd year, and shows no
signs of suffering from “that tired feeling.”
The portraits of S.A.’s new Governor,
Tennyson, mostly show him as a long-haired indi-
vidual with the rapt expression of a man who is
trying hard to compose his father’s poetry and
can’t manage it.
Governor Tennyson may claim some
connection with Australia, as his mother was
a niece of Sir John Franklin, Governor of V.D.L.
—1837-1843. He and Colonel “fire-low” Price
are therefore related.
The late Alderman John O’Brien, of
Goulburn (N.S.W.), just dead, was remarkable
during his term of office for a scheme to make
water go up-hill. However, water at Goulburn
still runs in the old style.
Died lately in Manchester (Eng.), R. G.
M'Cormick, a Coolgardie pioneer, with interests
later on at Bulong. He aspired to the Commons,
and helped himself along a bit by running a free
soup kitchen during a recent Manchester strike.
The Prince Ludwig von Loewenstein, re-
cently reported missing in London, was once a
midshipman in H.M. navy, and was on the Aus-
tralian station in the Pearl, with Commodore
Goodenough. Loewenstein, when here, was best
known for his extremely economical habits.
PROPOSED GOAT-OF-ARMS FOR THE
NEXT AUSTRALIAN ELEVEN.
Ex.-Rev. Arthur Rutledge, the Q. poli-
tician who resigns a Crown-Prosecutorship to con-
test a seat at forthcoming Q. elections, is brother
of Rev. W. W. Rutledge, one-time superintendent
Wesleyan Central Mission (Centenary Hall, Syd-
ney), and of Rev. Dr. Rutledge, C.E. The father
of this clerical family was for years schoolmaster
at Parramatta.
“Melb.” : Demise, beak Craib. The best
of our amateur magistrates, and familiar at City
Court. Craib had pure common sense, and was a
better magistrate than many of the P.M’s. The
boom broke his heart. By 30 years industrious
Bourke-street drapery he had acquired a fortune,
but the bank-robbers got it, and he had to go to
graft at the Mutual Store, managing.
Prof. Lyle, of Melb. University, who has
just started for Europe to look round the labora-
tories of the universities and report to Govt, on
technical education, is, students say, the best of
all the pedagogues at “ the shop.” He is a down-
right scientist, and when the Rontgen rays were
first discovered was able to demonstrate with
them from the brief cables in the newspapers
before the fuller accounts of the discovery came
out.
“ Dave ” M‘Caughey, who died lately in
N.S.W., with his brother, the great Sam, who
shears more sheep than any other man on earth,
held a small backblocks run in the 60’s, where
they did all their own work, inside and outside.
Plodding industry—and good luck—led to pas-
toral royalty. The M'Caugheys are nephews of
“ Salmon ” Wilson, who endowed Melb. Univer-
sity with .£40,000, and otherwise earned a knight-
hood.
It is again asserted in Brisbane that that
prominent Q.N. Bank-official did not die—that
the supposed corpse has been seen in Paris, with
its wife and children ; that it has also been seen
in London, and that the funeral and all the
obituary biz. were excellently well-acted by all
concerned. The Bulletin, however, believes Mr.
Drury to be as dead as mutton, and that the man
who looks to see if there are bricks in his alleged
coffin won’t get even a color.
Dates of creation of the titles of Australian
Governors: Gormanton (Tas.), 1478 ; Beauchamp
(N.S.W.), 1815; Lamington (Q.),1880 ; Hampden
(N.S.W.), 1881, Tennyson (S.A.) 1884; Brassey
(Vio.), 1886. Lamington, Hampden, and Tenny-
son are the second holders of their titles. Beau-
champ is the seventh, Brassey is the original, and
Gormanston’s number is lost in the mist of ages.
The second novel by John Reay Watson,
of Brisbane —“An Earthly Fulfilment”—will
shortly be published in London (says the Book-
kellow). Mr. Watson’s first book —“ In a Man’s
Mind” —was noticed in The Bulletin as intel-
lectually the strongest story yet written here. Its
faults were a little too much Youth, a little too
much Meredith, and a little too much Henry
James. But it was uncommonly clever ; and the
author, who avows it a juvenile work, reckons his
new book beyond comparison better.
A recently-admitted barrister in a Southern
province, and a jolly good fellow, will be able to
tell a tale of Australian life one of these days.
He has been one of the original shareholders in
Broken Hill, and a wild land-boomster, has filed .a
schedule approaching £lOO,OOO, been stone-broke
in all the provinces, including Maoriland, knows
Timon’s experiences of forgetful “friends,” has
never refused to share his last shilling with a pal,
has pulled himself together, studied hard, and is
now, no doubt, on the road to another fortune.
C. L. Garland, who hopes to start dredg-
ing operations in the bed of the Macquarie River
in a few months, was at one period the most pro-
mising of the young N.S.W. politicians who sat
behind Parkes. He was designated for the first
vacant portfolio at that time ; but Henry George
came along and bit him. Garland never recovered.
His enthusiasms he has therefore transferred to
mining, and the gigantic enterprise of dredging
the Macquarie is the result. “ Charley’s ” wife
was a newspaper woman of much nerve, and used
to run Carcoar Chronicle “all on her own.”
The very small Australian now
gets his chance in Sladen’s “ Who's
Who ? ” through the inclusion of
C.M.G’s and other three-lettered non-
entities. Quite unnecessary for the
editor to intimate that many of the re-
cords are really autobiographies—it is
obvious. For instance, Mr. F. W.
Webb, the estimable clerk of N.S.W.
Leg. Assembly, is allotted twice as
much space as Chief Justice May,
whose connection with the Privy Coun-
cil gives him foremost standing among
Australian jurists. Major Airey, ,of
N S.W. defence force, is actually glori-
fied at greater length than Kitchener
of Khartoum. George Collins Levey
(what is Levey ?) is there, with 27
lines; and Melb. Magistrate Panton
with 29 ; but Kipling, the incom-
parable literary fetish of John
Bull, is dismissed in 18. We
are told that Levey “is fond
of taking long walks and go-
ing to the theatre,” and even
that “ when he was younger
he was a good horseman
and rode a good deal.”
Only our minor personages
pull the plums in the Sladen
orchard. Edmund Barton has
a six-line record, and “Who’s
Who ” has entirely missed such
men as (to be catholic in selection)
Ministers Isaacs, Holder, ard
Peacock, H. H. Champion, Arch-
bishop K,edwood (M.L.), Henry
Lawson, and the majority of our
ablest lawyers, writers and politi-
cians—they are not C.M.G’s. _ In
spite of the want of proportion.
however, “ Who's Who ” is a very useful book of
reference, and immense labor has gone to its com-
pilation.
Dear Bulletin.— That (7/l/’99) remark
as to a Sydney Stipendiary Magistrate being a
lineal descendant of Addison, essayist, recalls
how G. A. Sala and a friend were one summer
morning exchanging praises of Addison in a
London park, when a seedy swell interrupted
with a request for charity as a lineal descendant
of the classical essayist. “ Sir,” said Sala, “ your
name may be Addison, but you seem to forget
that the illustrious essayist had only one child, a
daughter, who never married. True, she was an
idiot, which lends some color to your statement. "’
—Queen Anne. [But who shall say how many
children Addison had outside his biographies ?

Perhaps we are too enthusiastic in Aus-
tralia (says a writer in The Bookfellow), if our
bards are to continue wearing their old hats.
Fancy a provincial paper in England or America,
with 1000 or 2000 circulation, devoting a column
or more in criticism of a new book of verse—often
most capable criticism, nearly always most gener-
ous ! Here a commonplace, elsewhere it is a thing
almost unheard of. No wonder an author loses
balance, and slakes vanity instead of taking pains.
And in proportion to its population, Australia
buys verse more liberally than any other country in
the world. A sale like Kipling’s is the rarest thing
in England, where men like William Watson,
John Davidson, and Arthur Symons publish in
editions of five hundred to a 40-million population,
and do not always sell the five hundred. Yet
Lawson can sell 6000 copies of his verses at ss. in
less than two years—and grumbles ! He has sold
7000 volumes of his prose contemporaneously—and
gives Australian authors the alternative of London
or suicide !

One of two brothers who have made
Holder about the most familiar name in S. A.
died during the mid-February heat-wave. He
was the younger brother of Treas. Holder, him-
self physically the frailest man in the front rank
of Australian politicians. The brother, now dead,
was in the Public Service—railways traffic auditor
—and was thus debarred from politics ; but he
gave his energies to church work instead, and for
some time was at the head of the Christian
Endeavor cult. Treas. Holder, who aspires to
the Federal money-bags, and will have strong
support therefor (by the way, he was the real
inventor of “Braddon’s blot”), has never con-
ducted on his own account any larger financial
concern than a miniature weekly country paper.
Originally he was a public-school teacher.
BEFORE THE WEDDTNG CEREMONY.
MR. ARONSTEIN (to his new son-in-law) : “ Vell, Sol, there's my wedding-gift
cheque for £5000. But peesness is peesness—vat apout de discount?”
SOL: “ De discount? S’pose I gif you back your daughter. Vat say?”
Likely that editor Bonython, of S.A.
Advertiser, will be a candidate for the Federal
Parliament. He has put aside all temptations to
enter local politics, fearing that it might weaken
the influence of the Advertiser, which has always
been to him the ohiefest thing in existence.
Ex-Judge M'Farland, who was named in
connection with the Chief-Magistracy of Norfolk
Island, and who possesses an intimate book-know-
ledge of all that island’s affairs, was a District
Court Judge in Westralia before coming to
N.S.W. He was called to the Irish Bar 52 years
ago.

Gov. Brassey claims his descent from one
De Bracy, who “came over with the Conqueror.”
Scott introduces a descendant of De Bracy into
Ivanhoe. The descent in Brassey’s case is all
right, because the reader of the novel will remem-
ber that in his contest with another individual
clothed in ironmongery, De Bracy “ measured his
length on the paved floor.” That is, he fell off.
After which there can be little doubt about the
old man of the sea being a real De Bracy. ■
Rev. Hillman, an old-time Bible Christian
preacher, was superannuated in S.A. the other
day. Someone mentioned that he used to walk
30 miles on Sunday and preach three times. Bub
Hillman said that that was nothing compared
with what Chief Justice Way’s father did—he was
another pioneering Bible Christian. Hillman
remembered that Way once walked 50 miles to
preach—and brought back “ Clarke’s Commen-
taries,” in half-a-dozen ponderous volumes, on his
back.
Dorothy Vane’s announcement that she
intends burying her bright smile in a convent is
bringing grist to the postal mill. For the great
aggregate Stiggins has started writing to the sunny
Dorothy to point out the evils of the Holy Roman
doctrine, and the horrors of the Scarlet Woman;
and asking permission to call on her, and to lean
his faded brolly in a corner, and put his decayed
bell-topper on the table, and extract the pure and
genuine Word from the recessps of his greenish
tail-coat, and remonstrate with her at great
length.
S.A.’s new Gov. Tennyson is a bard with
difficulty. His greatest effort up to date is
“ Jack and the Beanstalk ” in bad hexameters,
some of the utter badness of which verse is shown
by this extract:
•Tack was a poor widow’s heir, but he lived as a drone in
8l beehive
Hardly a hand’stir a day did he work. To squander her
earnings •
Seemed to the poor widow hard, who raved and scolded
him always.
Nought in her house was left; not a cheese, not a loaf,
not an onion;
Nought, but a cow in her yard, and that must go to the
market.
“ Sell me the cow,” cried she; then he sold it, gad ! for a
handful — ... , ,
Only to think! —of beans. She shied them out thro
the window,
Cursing him : hied to her bed, there slept, but awoke in
amazement,
Seeing a huge bean-stalk, many leaves, many pods, many
flowers, . .
Rise to the clouds more tall than a tall Californian pine-
tree ;
High as a lark was Jack, scarce seen, and climbing away
“ Where an’ O where,” he shrilled ; she beheld his boots
disappearing; .
Pod by pod Jack arose, till he came to a pod that
alarmed him.
Bridge-like this long pod stretched out, and touched on
an island
Veiled in vapour.

pointed out that

that the court’s

Obit., last week at Richmond (Vic.), Wil-
liam M'Crea, late ohief medical officer of that pro-
vince, aged 86. His diploma is dated 1833 —
probably the oldest in Victoria. He was in the
navy from ’35 to ’6l, when he arrived in Tasmania
with a shipload of female convicts. Next he came
to Vic. and took oharge of a body of pensioners
formed to keep order on the goldfields. In 1853
he succeeded Dr. Sullivan as 0.M.0. Dr. M'Crea
was a very tough, old-fashioned warrior who,
between his naval and his conviot-time and prison
experiences, had very little sentiment left in his
originally-cast-iron nature. The old gentleman
had two gods—flogging and emetics.

“ Central,” re “ Crime in the Bush ” :
Since last Aug. I have travelled constantly amongst the
Scrub farmers, and can, from my own personal experi-
ence, verify much of what Lawson says. I find that the
Germans, as a rule, exhibit more laxity as to morals and
decency than Australians or Britishers ; it is quite
common to find a large family, consisting of parents and
children (of mixed sexes, up to the age of 20-25), all
sleeping in the one (and often only) bedroom in the
“house." The girls usually dress in either a chemise-
and-skirt or petticoat—the chemise open to the waist —or
a single garment only, loose dress generally ; and nearly
all German women are guiltless of shoes or stockings.
Only the other day came across a party, consisting of
mother, two boys (up to about 17 years of age), and three
girls (up to about 20 years old), coming from the creek :
had one towel among them, and said they had just en-
joyed a swim ! Further, at one house in the Scrub —(also
a German farmer’s)—when I asked for a “ camp” for the
night, they said I was welcome, provided I did not object
to sleeping with the “children.” Raised no objection to
that, but was much surprised to find the “children"
were a well-grown girl (of 10) and a lad (of some 7 years).
The only surprise I have is that crimes such as that
recently enacted at Gatton are not much more frequent
with these animal classes.

“ Bushman ” to The Bulletin :
Henry Lawson is wrong when he states (B. 10/2/’99) that
the Dederers killed their father, it having been an Indian
hawker whom they helped along to the land of Mahomet.
They were not brothers but cousins, their fathers being
brothers, and their mothers sisters. But why cite the
case of the Dederers as an instance of the ignorance and
godlessness of the Australian bush? William Dederer
lived for years at Allandale, near Maitland, and having
done a fair amount of droving with his father, saw per-
haps more of the world than youths of 18 usually see.
Fred. Dederer was brought up within seven miles of
Boggabri, on the N.W. railway, about 100 miles nearer
Sydney than Tucka Tucka, where the Melb. Cup
winners are bred. A private road which runs within
60yds. of the house where this lad lived was for some
years used ,by the travelling public, with whom, when
opportunity offered, Fred would talk for hours. The
evidence given at the trial notwithstanding, he attended
a house-to-house school for upwards of three years. Judge
\V indeyer, before whom he was tried, remarked that he
wrote very well for a youth in his position in life. His
father (an honest, industrious German, who fortunately
a ew n ?°. n tß s before the murder) frequently gave his
children religious instruction, made them say grace
before meals, heard them repeat their prayers every
night, and by his actions tried to be an example of all the
virtues. He never, however, supplied Fred with pocket-
money, and this, in large measure, led to the lad’s ulti-
mate downfall. I venture to say that thousands of boys
about whom not half the trouble was taken will become
useful citizens, and, in the face of the fact that almost
every day we hear of well-informed people going wrong,
while their less fortunate brethren continue on the right
path, it becomes a question whether the ignorance and
depravity of the bush are worth troubling about quite so
much.

berry Picking at Bulli.” Was passing through
the reeky hamlet t’other day, and the whole popu-
lation was out, with babies and buckets, picking
away for dear life. Remember the same bush full of
birds. Later on, ran against a policeman and, as I
was after game, asked him if there were any birds
about. He said “ No,” and that he “couldn’t make
it out, as there used to be whips of them.” lex-
plained how it was and he looked upon me as a
genius. Fancy birds living, or trying to live, at
Bulli ! Don’t go there to shoot. [This correspon-

“Ponte”: If the “girl-pupil” hasn’t
been shut down on, let me say a word. It’s bad
policy to keep any matured pupil in alone—not
merely because of the hysterical charges lfkely or
possibly to be made by the girl, but as a sort of
“get thee behind me, Satan.” In the bush, the
general tone of morality is low, for there is little
pleasure—outside sexual —to be indulged in. The
provincial school-teacher, as a rule, being young
and inexperienced, should never subject himself
to the additional temptation of propinquity. I
know several teachers who have been forced into
ill-assorted marriages merely through “keeping-
in ” a well-developed girl, it is a fatal habit, for
once started she is kept in very often, and the
teacher is either removed or married suddenly. I
know.

“Kati-K.”: A Bulletin correspondent
(7/l/’99) says that taste for a particular style of
landscape is controlled by the sort of scenery
amongst which generations of ancestors have
courted. Rats ! The Englishman loves the bril-
liant coloring of his native land because his
ancestors for generations raised the leather bottel
to their lips heavy and laid it down light, amid
that melodrama-poster scenery. The Irishman
loves the verdancy of the Emerald Isle because it
carries with it tender associations of the drinks of
10 centuries. The Scotchman, right back to the
Stone age, has looked upon heather-clad hills on
each side of his whisky-flask, and the laws of
heredity and association prevent him from loving
any other class of scenery as well. Give the Aus-
tralian time, and he will develop this inherited
love of a particular style of Australian landscape.
The Westralian, when away from home, will go
into ecstasies over a stretch of hot sand and a tin
shanty, because his forbears have so long imbibed
their snakejuice thus environed. The Queens
lander’s emotions will break him up when—a
stranger in a strange land—he sees a piebald pony.
It will remind him of the mottled coloring of the
land in which his ancestors have a for centuries
“ given it a name.” The Sydney yachtsman, aftei
a century or two of whisky-and-water “down the
Harbor,” will love a waterscape of any sort. And
the man “out-back” will look through the bottom
of his glass at the dismal greys of the gum-tree
wilderness, and say “ Damn fine ” ! Why is it the
whisky and not the girl round whom the old
associations gather ? Because the whisky doesn’t
get grey and wrinkled in its old age, and the beer
has no mother-in-law, and the generous red wine
never has a family of 12 children. That’s why.

“ Alia ”: Was out in the bush shoot-
ing and came across a small terrier dog
accompanying a horse turned out to graze.
A few days afterwards saw them again. En-
quired and found they were owned by the local
baker. When the horse ran in the cart the dog
always accompanied him, and when the horse was
turned out for a spell the dog went also and faith-
fully stuck to his mate. Sometimes the spell
would be for a month or six weeks, and what the
dog lived on during that period was a mystery to
everyone but himself and the horse, as he never
returned home during these holidays.

“0.P.” : Mick Corliss
was a new boy. He was large
and freckled, with a gammy
leg, and soon established
himself as hard-case-in-gene-
ral to the school. Our cur-
riculum included letter-writ-
ing every Friday afternoon
—epistles usually addressed
to the master, our parents,
or a particular chum, and
mostly upon very uninter-
esting subjects. But Mick
broke up all precedent, and
boldly commenced “ Dear
Maud ” (Maud was the big-
gest girl in the school), then
went on to acquaint her with
his earnest desire to clasp
her to his waistcoat, and
finished up with —“Dear
Maud, if [ don’t see you
again—Hello ! ” As soon as
old C , the teacher, could
get his breath, he trounced
hopping-Mick terrifically up
and down the room, stop-
ping now and then to re-
mark, breathlessly, “If I
don’t see you again—Hello ! ”
Hard fact! Maud’s in

he said : “ This is the

and fifteen double-barrelled guns were discharged
simultaneously under the liuinpy. The place took
fire and the newly-wedded pair had to flee into the
wilderness and spend the night in a hollow tree.

poor ould Leg-o'-Mutton Jack, who sarved his
toime wid Stutterin’ Blaxland, found the wade,
an’ took three floggin’s of 50 lashes aitch rather

old fable a parting kick, let me say that even 20
years ago it was rank heresy to doubt its truth !

Dear Bulletin.—So the artesian bores
are failing. Of course they’ll fail. The cistern
from which the pressure arises, unless replenished,
must get shallower, thus reducing the height of
the water-column. Eventually, say in 1,000,000
years, the bores will be like the perforations of a
colander, and when connected will be underground
reservoirs for rain-water. Therefore, carpe diem.

“ H.S.” writes more about water-getting
When aboriginals find a slimy, undrinkable pool ol
water, they make a hole on the lower side and allow the
pure water to niter through. The roots of several kinds
of trees in and around ltiverina yield a sappy kind of
water often of disagreeable taste, but the best water-
yielding tree is the dense-leaved mallee, the roots of
which run near surface. I have often drunk water so ob-
tained in the biff desert. The blackboys prized up the
roots with sticks after breaking off the sandy soil —then
chopped the roots in convenient lengths. I, standing the
ends in pannikins, soon had a fair supply of good water.
This tree grows about 15ft. high, and the leaves have a
denser and ruddier appearance than in ordinary mallee.
The aboriginals, also, sometimes obtain water from a
“piped" tree by inserting a bunch of feathers or grass
tied to end of stick, and then licking off the water or
allowing it to dram into a wooden bowl. They are also
expert in finding frogs and getting water from them. In the
dry parts of -Westralia, where rock-holes are occasionally
found, the natives fill these with large stones so arranged
as to displace as little water as possible and yet prevent
animals from fouling it. As the water gets lower they re
move a layer, and so on, until all gone. They are also
expert at collecting in vessels the heavy dew of dry
localities. Many bushmen acquainted with these facts
have nevertheless died of thirst, simply because the right
trees were not there to tap and the rock-holes were
dry : and others, with less knowledge, have often passed
water close by without knowing it. Many thirst-deaths
have occurred through missing “native wells,” which
are usually so easily passed by that it needs an experi-
enced traveller to detect signs of their vicinity. Some of
these wells are not more than 2ft. deep and about the
same in diameter, whilst others go down (even in sandy
country) to a depth of 10 or 12ft., the dia., however,
rarely exceeding 2ft. Some wells have a small drive at
the bottom, so arranged that when the water gets shal-
low it cannot be seen from the top of the hole. These
wells have been found in almost every part of Australia.

So, if the community numbers 1000, and the land is worth
£1,000,000, every man’s interest is worth £lOOO, and, if he
owns more than his fair share, he should be heavily
taxed. But, if everybody only owns his fair share, then,
as you observe, “ every man gets what is rightfully his
own.” Only you insist that he should get it exactly in the
way your little tin-god suggested, and, if he gets it quite as
fairly, butnol exactly asvour tin-god proposed, you become

The world’s champion pictorial horror is
the “ View of the remains of the murdered man,”
recently published by Perth Western Mail in
connection with the “ Mt. Magnet Mystery.”
The tranquil dreadfulness of the arrangement of
the ghastly relics for photographic effect is fitly
matched by the thick-headed, brutal Mail’s
complacent remark that “ the remains, as can be
seen, are in a very advanced state of decomposi-
tion.”
Some Papuana from “ 6YH.” :
Met a chap t’other day who had left Papua just as the
“ bad ” season was commencing. Had fever all the same,
and reckoned another month of it would just about have
settled him. He says Port Moresby (capital of British
Papua) has 15 inhabitants ; Sainarai (chief port), 40 ; and
Mambar6 goldfield about 100. Originally there were 300
miners at latter place, but fever, dysentery, and invalided
departures have accounted for the other 200—over 20 per
cent, dying.
Some of the niggers who murdered Green si ill await
trial, though it is about two years since their arrest.
Native prisoners are made policemen when their sen-
tences are served, and on one occasion, when the corporal
was called away for a week, one of the prisoners was
actually put in command of the remaining police. This
particular prisoner was serving five years for the murder
of another native. Ex-Gov. Macgregor once sent out a
party of native constabulary to “ disperse” a village
which was sheltering some native murderers, and during
the subsequent looting the “ dispersers” struck a lot of
“ trade” that the Governor had himself given the same
nigs., apparently in the interests of Christianity. On
return they took the loot to old Mac., and also an alleged
criminal (aged apparently 130 or thereabouts): “ Where
are the rest of the prisoners’” demanded the Governor.
“ Oh,” was the answer, “ we only got this one alive, and
shot four’’(meaning 84). “Ah ! weel,” said Mac., “ that’ll
be a lesson to them ! ” But he didn’t say anything about
the “ trade.”
Sir William used to say there was no Sunday in Papua,
but on one occasion, when he was camped in a place
where building was going on, a subordinate of his got up
about 4 a.m. one Sunday, and commenced work on a roof
with a gang of prisoners, but almost at the first “ bang"
on the galvanised iron old Mae. rushed out, in a terrible
huff, and ordered stoppage. And after that there was
Sunday in Papua.
Burns, Philp, and Co. apparently think they own Port
Moresby, where they run a sort of a banking institution,
and draw' the screws of the civil servants. They also have
the only store there, with a tram-line up to it. Grade, 1
in 2. Takes a score of niggers at the winch to haul a
truck up about a mile per week.
British Papua boasts of 3 horses and 6 fowls. Drinks,
6d., but no pub. accommodation to speak of.
The missionaries (headed by Stone-Wigg) aren’t doing
much in ihe soul-catching line. One native dared to lift
a spear to one of the holy men, and Judge Winter gave
him two months, but on expiry of his term he was made
a “ bobby ” at 10s. a month.
The best “ trade ” for the natives is colored plates out
of fashion journals, hoop-iron, and empty bottles, of
which latter there is significant abundance.

In a Southland (M.L.) town, where the local hall be-
longs to the hotel, a cinematograph artist was billed the
other day. But the Scotch landlady had dark suspicions
of his solvency, and when he asked about the possibilities
of the place, she replied sadly, “It’s nae guid, laddie,
ye’ll no draw a hoose, it’s nae the thing to tak’. Can ye
change a pun’? ” He said he could and she went for the
pound but returned instant^’: “ Laddie, can ye change
twapun’?” The “ cine ” artist said he could. Then a
second later he heard a voioe ringing out somewhere in
the back premises : “ Mon, Jock, it’s a’ recht, he can
change twa pun’. I’ll gang awa’ back an’ tell him it’s a
guid town and he’ll hae a gran’hoose the nicht.”
Some years ago an eccentric German whose duty it was
to sleep on the premises of a Sydney wax-works used to
carry his mattrass up to the “ Chamber of Horrors ” on
the top floor, and camp in front of a different female
murderer every night. During the day, also, while
sweeping and dusting, he used to talk to the she-slaugh-
terers, his favorite crony being Louisa Collins (the last
woman hanged in Darlinghurst Gaol), the slayer of
several husbands. So that she maintained even in wax
her fleshly fascinations. At each of her first two trials
she con’trived to fairly mesmerise a juror, and so brought
about a disagreement. It was not until the third trial
that she was convicted.

56. The last marriage may turn out well, but in the
light of Patti’s first experience it doesn’t look wise. She
found life with the old marquis unbearable, so one night
in St. Petersburg she shifted over to Nicolini’s hotel and
lived with him openly. Queens can afford to defy Mrs.
Grundy. Then Nie. worked for her, giving up his career,
during 30 years for his board and lodging and a suit of
clothes at Christmas. It would be poetical justice, and
quite in the picture if her boy-husband, tiring of her
faded charms, were to skip off to the hotel of some youth-
ful cantatrice and earn his divorce. At Patti’s first mar-
riage the managers of the world were afraid that mater-
nity might rob them of the diva, but the young lady
promptly put them all down by signing contracts for two
years ahead, guaranteeing under heavy penalties not to
become a mother during that period, or at any other
time. She is aptly called goddess—love, wealth, fame,
talent, beauty, and absolute freedom have been hers.
For 40 years she has done just as she pleased, regardless
of God or man
When the massive g.ydia von Finkelstein-who lectured
on Jerusalem and things under the auspices of the Much-
Travelled—was raking in the shekels of the regenerate up
Queensland, she had the-gall to complain to the munici-
pality of a certain town that she was being charged for
the hall at the same rate as “ acting people,” which was
derogatory to her Divine Mission. The Mayor replied
that he considered her one of the finest actresses he had
ever seen, whereupon the local parsons presented her
with an address of condolence. As a sample of adaman-
tine cheek, on the one part, and parsonical priggery, on
the other, this takes beating. The present sertbe once
moreor less interviewed the Finkelstein
at a bydney hotel a couple of hours before one of her
holy orations. He found the lady “ taking it easy ” on a
couch in company with a very long whisky-and-soda and
a box of cigarettes. However, you’d have thought, from
her platform appearance, that she lived on locusts and
wild hnnev

During one melodramatic season at cne old Charlie
Napier Theatre, Ballarat (long since made into a brewery),
the heavy villain had an exceedingly bad time at the
hands of the diggers, who took his harrying of the beauti-
ful and virtuous heroine so seriously that the representa-
tive of the bold, bad man was fist-beaten three nights in
succession, and assailed with eggs and other noxious
missiles on the occasion of every appearance. Then the
actor struck, and refused to continue in the part unless
allowed to make a speech to the audience every night
before going on. The point was conceded, and, after
that, each performance was preceded by a small oration
from the villain, in which he begged the gentlemen pre-
sent not to identify him with the character he repre-
sented, which, he declared, he loathed, being naturally a
mild and peaceable man, and possessed, moreover, witl’
an arden t affection for the heroine, who was his wife.
After that, the villain was not molested, but business
collapsed suddenly.

thp hp«t mvinn- ni»™ Heather Waltz was about
the best-paying piece of musio yet published m Australia ;
and that people would be surprised to find what along
long way after are the profits of other composers ” Let
me tell you that in point of number Juncker’s “ I was
Dreaming” sold several to one against the “Heather
Waltz.” Sir William Robinson’s “Remember me no
more,” Packer’s “ Listening,” Juncker’s “Heart’s Desire ”
all exceeded in number the Fitz-Stubbs’ publication If
you would let the public of the various Australian provinces
know what you have for sale, you must advertise in each
province : also, you must pay local artistes to singorplay
your music, for without special pay they won’t perform
local music no matter how good it may be. It is the
singing of a song that makes it sell; no one buys songs
he doesn’t hear. Australia is too big, and divided, and
with too small and scattered a population to make music-
publishing pav, although we have some excellent com-
posers living amongst us. Boosey and Co., of London
are starting a provincial tour of “ MaMie Rosette” in the
spring, and iiave written out, asking permission to in-
elude “ I was Dreaming ” in the opera, not a bad compli-
ment to Australia. There is in Australia a strong
tendency to sneer at everything not bearing “ the ball-
mark of England,” and this is sedulously encouraged by
local teachers, who will never teach, or speak favorably
of, anything by another local teacher. I once offered a
popular lady vocalist £3 3s. cash to sing “ I was Dream-
ing,” and she declined, because Miss Nellie Stewart’s name
was on the song ; but f li\ed to hear her sing it without a
fee, when it became the rage. I have published over 60
songs and had two big successes-“I was Dreaming,” and
“ Drifting Away.”
Anybody noticed that artists who come out to Australia
(not previously much known in London), and are
“starred” by tub Firm, after they go back “go up
top” in the foggy metropolis? Louis Bradfleld, one
example. Not heard of till he played “lead” in “In
Town,” etc., through Australia. Is now referred to in
London papers as “ FYed Leslie’s successor.” Ada Reeve
another case. And, when you come to think of it, a
great number of the imported “ stars” seem to have been
mighty small planets before they started to twinkle in
the Southern heavens.
Ri Kenningham’s ability to distinguish musical pitch.
The 14-year-old daughter of a Brisbane violinist has this
power and can also name any individual note struck on
an unseen piano. This child is by no means a brilliant
player, but has passed two Trinity College exams, (honors
once)
((D „ . „ ru „ ~ . ~ .. . ~ . .
• ■ Why call the power of distinguishing musical
pitch a rare faculty ? Any musician with an ear of
average accuracy can at once tell the pitch of a note
Moreover, the faculty when not inborn can be acquired
by others not so gifted. Leschitizsky was said to have
been much impressed by Yvonne Leverner s possession of
this gift. This announcement at the time caused great
amusement to several young Australians who are Yvonne s
equals in this respect. At the Conservatoire de Musique,
Sydney, classes are held to impart “the rare faculty.”
Surely they are not more backward in England ? Mozart
may have been the “ first-known instance,” but it is
absurd to suppose that Handel and Bach were not also
“ masters of pitch.”

‘blacking’ their faces until I saw these ‘ niggers’ at St.
James’, and then I grasped that no ‘white man’ dare

that they fell flat when ejected from the ‘corner-men’s’
lips is nearly as feeble as ‘ them jokes’ themselves. For
years it has been said that the pastry-faced, parson-ridden,

patronised their only London entertainment because of
the Moral to be deduced from its surroundings.”
Henry Lee, the slow-change artist, has introduced a
lot of human interest into his show. The changes which
were formerly shut out from view by heavy curtains are
now transacted behind gauze, so that the audience can
watch the process of converting Ulysses Grant into Pope
Leo, and so on, and appreciate the careful details of the
' “ r ' k ° the ““
“ Shifter”: Harry Power was a crony of that queer old
Jimmy Hogan, Lysters super-master. Some Irish star
was drawing at Melb. Royal. Says Hogan to Lyster, at
Opera House, “Sir, couldn’t we put up a little Oirish
kammedy?” Lyster (tugging his beard)Where's the
Irishman?” Hogan : “Methinks, sir, ve wouldn’t have
far to luk for him,” meaning himself. He said to Power:
“ Harry, me bhi, I leave ye all the mannuscripts in me
box. I’d turn in me grave if that vagabone, Long An-
drews, got a hoult of ’em.” Poor Jimmy adorned Cop-
pin’s dramatic home.
Dear Bulletin.—The alleged authorities who have been
trying to prove that John Coleman copied the “ Scare-
crow Dance ” from someone or other have been just about
,I ?P. ro J ins Burgess guilty of
the Gat.ton muider and of the butchei’v r of some confeder-
ate who has never been known to exist. Probably you
have had enough of it by now, but I submit the follow-
ing version of the matter given me by Coleman, which I
hope you will publish in justice to that comedian. Cole-
nan absolutely denies that he copied the dance from
anyone, and says that the supposed “ Scarecrow ” o!
Jlilly Ashcroft was in reality a burlesque of a set of
quadrilles which he (Coleman) is now doing in the
“ Forty Thieves” pantomime. He admits that he copied
this dance from Ashcroft, but states that he did it with
Ashcroft's consent. One-legged comedian Shields, who
writes that he saw Milburn doing it 20 years ago, has not
possibly been able to see Coleman for 14 years, and it was
only seven years ago when Coleman claims to have origi-
nated the danoe. When in N.Y. Coleman saw a drunken
man coming out of the Miners’ Bowery Theatre, and his
walk was so peculiar chat he decided to do it on the stage.
He gradually developed it into an eccentric dance,
getting the idea of the abrupt stoppage, which is such a
humorous feature of it, from a comedian who was pulled
up suddenly in the middle of a dance owing to some
hitch in the orchestra. The dance took on, and Coleman
embellished it at different times with new ideas until it
became the “Scarecrow” which we know. It was first
done by him at the California Theatre, ’Frisco, seven
years ago. Coleman states positively that it got the
name of “ Scarecrow ” from the Australian press, and, to
his recollection, he had never heard of a danoe of that
name before. “As a matter of fact,” he says, “ I have
made so much money out of it here, and it has been so
successful with the Australian public, that I can afford to
laugh at those who have attempted, in the most ridicu-
lous manner, to show that I was not the originator. It
is natural that it should have caused a good deal of
jealousy, and to that I attribute the charge of copying.
A good deal has been said about Ashcroft. Now Ashcroft
was a personal friend of mine. I remember him saying
to me when I was quite a lad—‘ My boy, I want you to
sing ‘ Muldoon the Solid Man ’ when you are grown up,
because I know you will not ridicule the character.’
And I have sung the ‘ Solid Man,’ and have made a suc-
cess of it; but Ashcroft never danced the ‘ Scarecrow,’
nor anyone else, and those who have been writing to the
contrary have only succeeded in giving me a cheap advt.”

THE GREAT SPECIFIC FOR
DEBILITY AND SUMMER AILMENTS.
A Sydney Cure.
To anyone having the care of a large house on their hands,
and whose household duties claim almost their entire attention,
it is both inconvenient and annoying to be in a continuous state
cf ill-health. This is what Mrs. M. Petersen, of 150 Woolloo-
mooloo-street, Woolloomooloo, Sydney, had to put up with.
Hearing that this lady had suffered for a long time in a most
distressing manner, and had at last been cured almost miraculously
by Bile Beans, a reporter called to get particulars of her case, and
the following is the lady’s story :
‘‘l had been ill for a long time, suffering from loss of sleep,
continuous headaches, and sharp pains in my chest and between
my shoulders. I was so bad that I found it impossible to get
through my household duties, and was compelled to obtain assist-
ance. I suffered in this mariner for over nine months. My
medical adviser recommended a change of air, but that was ini-
irossible under existing arrangements, as I couldn’t leave the
house for any time. I tried no end of so-called specifics, but none
af them did me any good, and I might as well have kept the
anoney. I kept on getting worse, and the pains became almost
unbearable, causing me so much
agony that I could hardly stand.
I can’t describe the sufferings I
went through, and I was begin-
ning to feel seriously alarmed
about my condition, for I was
rapidly losing weight, when my
husband persuaded me to try
Bile Beans for Biliousness; and
it was a happy day for me when
I did so, for I commenced to ex-
perience relief at once. In a day
or so I noticed a decided change in my condition, which was
materially improved, so I naturally continued with them ; and
now, after taking five boxes, I feel as well as ever I did. The
pains have left me, my sleep has returned, I can perform my house-
hold duties with energy, and at times am positively ashamed of
my increased appetite. My friends and acquaintances say lam
looking wonderfully well. That my recovery is duo solely to Bile
Beans there is no doubt whatever, for I have taken no other medi-
cine for some months ; and, in conclusion, I may add that should
you desire to publish this account of my illness and recovery, you
are at perfect liberty to do so, as I know Bile Beans cured me and
I’m not ashamed of it.”
BILIOUSNESS AND LIVER COMPLAINT CURED.

SLEEP AND HOW TO GET IT-
Hot weather brings in its train amongst a lot of other disagree-
able ailments and afflictions, insomnia. A hot night, a too-heavy
meal, a little extra worry, and —lo and behold —the goddess Sleep
refuses to visit our bedside. A panacea, Bile Beans, fortunately
now changes all this sort of thing. The weather may be hot, a
good square meal eaten, and regular work done with perfect ease.
After the use of this world-famed remedy, insomnia becomes a
thing of the past. Cures on every hand attest this, and also attest
the fact that other ailments such as Biliousness, Sick and Nervous
Headache, Indigestion, Constipation, Piles, Female Weakness,
Pale-Faced Girls, Irregularities, Bad Breath, Pimples, Blotches,
Dizziness, all Liver and Kidney Troubles, Dyspepsia, Heart Pal-
pitation, Pain in Back and Side, fulness after eating, lack of
physical tone, Heartburn, and that Tired Feeling. Bile Beans
are not an ordinary medicine. They are manufactured in one of
the best-fitted and equipped laboratories in the world, at Detroit,
Michigan, U.S.A., and they have been used throughout that
country by the best physicians for years. The amount of time
necessarily expended in compounding Bile Beans would, even if
someone had the formula, exclude imitators from manufacturing
them, as it is only on account of the sales being in the millions
monthly that they can be sold at the low price, the cost of ingre-
dients being so great. In Australia alone last year 20 million
doses of Bile Beans were taken, curing thousands of ailments, on
every hand considered incurable. One thing to always remember.

SOME HINTS FOR SUMMER WEATHER.
HOW TO KEEP HEALTHY.
General debility is a state which is generally caused by a com-
bination of nervous exhaustion, indigestion, deranged liver, and
constipation. It is brought about by the system becoming run
down. The functions of the body are irregular and weak, the
waste matter is not carried off properly, the blood becomes poor,
and the complexion sallow. The whole system in cases like this
needs “ toning up.” The diet must be regulated, and a remedy
must be taken that will put the digestive organs in thorough work-
ing order. For this work, Bile Beans for Biliousness are the very
best specific, as they act in a gentle manner, and are so com-
pounded that they repair the waste of the nervous system, and
make pure, rich blood. Bile Beans on every hand are effecting
cures for debility and all summer ailments, such as loss of tone,
lack of physical force, &c., &c. Sold at a low price, they come
within the reach of all ; and that the great mass of Australians
appreciate this fact is illustrated by the fact that last year over 20
million doses were taken in Australia alone.
20 Million Doses! Consumed in Australia in ’9B.

Last year was a most unwholesome one in

1897).
Matthew Battersby is the Ministerial can-

When N.S.W. Parliament meets, its atten-

many think, uncalled-for, sums recently granted
in Minister Young’s electorate.
Westralia admits the validity of naturalisa-
tion papers issued in Britain alone. Naturalisa-
tion papers issued by the other provinces of Aus-
tralasia have no value in Forrestland.
“ Tinii ” asks if it is true that a nephew of
a N.S.W. Minister is a large shareholder in the
Clyde ironworks, which lately obtained a large
Govt, iron contract although not the lowest
tenderer.
The recent N.S.W. police-collected popu-
lation-statistics show the alien population on the
Northern rivers to be 1125, divided as follows :
Richmond and Tweed, 918 ; Clarence, 207. Cudgen,
on the Tweed, has an alien population of 236,
against 532 Europeans.
At latest advices the weighing clauses of
N.S.W. Coal Mines statute are still wholly dis-
regarded by the coal-owners, who break the law
with impunity. And their accomplices, the mem-
bers of the N.S.W. God-fearing Ministry, make
no more sign than a wooden god.

and other Royal Familians, and tfie thousands
of hirelings in attendance on lords who demand
reverence for the Throne from everybody about
them, and you have an army of professional God
Save the Queeners. These represent a noisy
claque for the monarchial show, quite apart from
the grovelsome press and the Army and Navy
adherents of Her Gracious.
How specious is the contention that Mel-
bourne has the better of the deal over the site of
the Federal city! Where is the N.S.W. anti-
Billite who would whoop for joy if the situation
was reversed and Sydney allowed to have the first
Parliament until a Viotorian capital could be de-
termined on ?
An unemployed deputation, professing to
represent over 7000 workless men in Sydney and
suburbs, tried to call on Premier Reid the other
day to find out when the Jolly-and-Fat era was
going to begin, but the Ministerial door shut in
their faces with a loud whack. The Rail-Painting
Industry is off.
Sometimes virtue is rewarded even on this
earth. It is pleasing to note that nearly all the
decent, consistent Q. Democrats stand well with
their constituents, and have a splendid chance of
being rewarded by being returned to next Parlia-
ment. As to the shifty and the shufflers—they
are mostly booked for the shelf.
Nearly every place in N.S.W. is grabbing
with all its feet and hands now for the Federal
capital. Moss Vale, Bowral and Mittagong,
which, even measured along the sinuous railway
line, are from 14 to 23 miles the wrong side of the
100-mile limit and consequently haven’t “a
possible,” are as loud as the rest.
Mines Minister Cook, by postponing for
an additional two months the operation of the
weighing clauses in N.S.W. Coal Mines Act, does
for employers what no N.S.W. Minister has ever
done for employed— i.e., he has practically sus-
pended an Act of Parliament to afford breathing-
time to the employer side in the dispute.
Bulcocking the Q. electoral-rolls has re-
ceived a tardy slap in the face, owing to two recent
Northern Supreme Court decisions. In Barcoo
electorate, 112 voters were struck off, because a
certain person said they were not qualified. Two
appealed, and beat the objector. Yet the court
refused to grant costs to appellants. The other
110, not having appealed, are still disfranchised.
The present Federal situation proves the
wisdom of those who caused Reid to hold his
hand when he wanted to start a palatial Parlia-
ment House in Sydney, a year and a-half ago. If
that great structure had been built, there would
have been nothing to put in it but a much-
reduced local Legislature, which would have
fitted its tenement about as well as a cockroach
does a tank.
Taken all round, the Q. Cabinet goes to
the country personally “dead-broke.” It is as
seedy and out-at-elbows a crowd as ever faced the
electors in a life-or-death gamble. More than one
member of it has absolutely ceased signing cheques,
and there is one Minister who, if he doesn’t
speedily buy a new pair of pants, will (or should —
for the two things don’t mean the same thing in
Queensland) be run in by the police.
Premier Reid goes to the Clarence in
April, and is in receipt of letters inviting him to
tour the North as the saviour of the sugar-
growers. It is quite possible that Reid will go
down in Australian history as the man who com-
pelled the Parliamentary Opposition to stand by
the cane-growers in their hour of need —the man
without whom the country would have been
swamped with cheap nigger-grown sugar. Quite
possible.
Premier Reid draws at-
tention to an important point
in Federal finance. The Com-
monwealth will purchase from
the provinces their telegraph
lines, postal and telegraph
buildings, barracks, and other
structures. Victoria will re-
ceive about .£3,000,000 under
tlii- head ; N.S.W. about
£3.000,000 ; S. A. about
£1,250,000; Queensland rather
more ; W.A. and Tasmania
about £500,000. Now Vic-
toria .paid for almost all these
matters out of revenue, so it
can, with some show of fair-
ness, use the money to pay
off its revenue deficit, though
it would be much better to
use it in reduction of the per-
manent debt. The other three
provinces paid for them mostly
out of loan-moneys, and, if
they put the proceeds into
revenue, it will be the worst
kind of swindle. Yet they all
do. that kind of swindle. For
instance, when they sell land
the money goes into revenue.
Then they buy some of it back
again—say for railways. They
don’t buy it back out of
revenue, or even partly out
of revenue. The patient old
loan provides every penny of
the money.
“ Malle ” ; A very sub-
ordinate Sydney public official
got into Departmental trouble
recently, and was instructed
by the Civil Service Board to
hold himself in readiness to
proceed “out back”; where-
upon he observed that “ he’d
be hanged if he’d go; his
lodge would see he didn’t
leave Sydney.” The Board,
however, was firm, and re-
moved the recalcitrant forth-
with —to a suburb fully 2\
miles away. The Board isn’t
going to be trifled with.
King Humbert of Italy has decorated the

Sydney Telegraph on Potato Young,
N.S.W. Minister of Works, and his recent works
contracts:
Mr. Young believes that even at a slightly advanced
cost it is a good thing to keep the work in the country,
which is exactly what the political party opposed to him
has been saying all along.
Another bang on the head of the joss. The Reid
Freetrade Government, on its contract arrange-
ments, is now in the extraordinary position of
being supported by the Protectionist Star and
battered by its own Freetrade organ. Why
doesn’t the Reid crowd preach Protection as well
as practise it, instead of frantically denying the
existence of its only virtue ?
In the course of one day’s work,
recently, hearing Old Age Pension
claims at Wellington (M.L.), 33 full
pensions were granted, 17 to men and
16 to women. The oldest applicant
was aged 84 years. This official over-
haul of the oldest inhabitants is cal-
culated to cast much doubt on the race
of alleged centenarians. Hardly any
of the very venerable applicants could
really prove their ages, and they were
mostly passed on their toothlessness
and generally-worn-out appearance, or
upon inferences drawn from the ages
of their children or grandchildren.
The centenarians date back to a period
when there was little accurate regis-
tration, and they are mostly accepted
on their own report or on local tradi-
tion. One applicant only got through
by his unmarried daughter swearing
that she was aged 48, which was a
courageous thing for any spinster to
do. An impression is already arising
that the law requires to be altered
with a view to hearing applications in
camera. The long procession of the
aged applicants is too much of a free
show, and the crowd guffaws when the
single girl of 52 swears to her age to
back up the old man’s application, and
then coilapses with a blush of shame in
the witness-box.
With the troublesome Filipinos
and Cubans to monopolise attention, it
is pretty certain that America will at
least ease off her championship of Ire-
land and other jumped-on nations.
For years Irishmen carried on their
most virulent agitation on the other
side of the herring-pond. Before the
Spanish war, too, the Cuban revolu-
tion was directed by a Junta in New
York. And, were Britain not so anxious for
Jonathan’s friendship, she might secure a pretty
revenge for his covert interference in Irish affairs,
by encouraging, instead of suppressing, the fili-
bustering and other schemes of the Filipino Junta
located at Hong Kong.
The Australian Star (Sydney) is at pre-
sent delicious reading. Someone once claimed for
that journal that it influenced 12,000 votes at least
against the Convention Bill last year by a vigorous
tirade against its shortcomings, more especially
the Braddon Blot. Now the Star goes whole-
souled for the Cause, and pokes gentle borak
against Dr. Maclaurin’s anti-Billite arguments in
Sydney Telegraph. The doctor’s arguments
against the Bill are all those that the Star so
applauded a year ago.
Batchelor, leader of S.A. Labor-party,
fears that, owing to the raising of the green stan-
dard on the question of the educational capita-
tion grant by Archbishop O’Reilly, he will lose
quite 1000 of the votes he polled in ’96, as a large
proportion of the West Adelaide workers are
Catholics. Premier Kingston, his colleague, has
always been nominally a capitationist, so that he
will not be much affected unless too enthusiastic
priestly support turns other votes against him.
Otago Witness, a Conservative organ pub-
lished in the Scotch city of Dunedin, where it
always rains, implores Maoriland to swear-off
Seddon’s ideas of Council reform and go in for an
Upper House like Victoria’s. Says that Victoria’s
48 Rich Landlords are “closely in touch’’ with
the public, and that there has beep “unbroken
harmony for 30 years ” between the two Houses.
Which shows how things look viewed from afar off
through a haze of Scotch mist and Scotch
whisky.
The latest batch of suggested names for
the Federal capital: Federal City, Salutaria,
Salaria, Alexandrina, Guelph, Britannia, Unitia.
Truly the Australian is a bald and wretched hand
at nomenclature. In the end Australia will
probably have to borrow a name that has dropped
out of use elsewhere, the old Spanish genius for
inventing poetic designations not being in him.
By the way someone writes suggesting Paulsburg
—one of the latest-built of capitals having been
christened Petersburg.
A Sydney paper reports G. Republican
Dibbs thus : —“I say that N.S.W. should have
drawn up a Constitution herself for Federation
and let the others come in if they liked. Why
should she have to go cap-in-hand asking for
favors of the others ? ’’ To adopt this Damchica-
goan view of the Federal situation would have
saved infinite trouble. The theory that the benefits
and losses under Federation should be considered
merely from a N.S.W. standpoint is beautifully
characteristic of the Cabbage-tree mob.
The Bulletin is much concerned to see it
printed that the arrangement made by the Pre-
miers’ Conference as to the Federal capital fails to
meet with the approval of “ Mr. Searl, the Syd-
ney florist.” “The Sydney trade,” says Mr.
Searl, “ must suffer to a very great extent.” Also,
it was printed, the other day, that Mr. Searl is
much narked at certain pronouncements made by
the R.C. authorities concerning flowers at funerals.
Between the priests and the politicians, the emi-
nent Mr. Searl seems to be in for a bad time.
Item from the report of Footscray (Vic.)
Gas co. :
O.ur co. has now to contend against a rise in the price
of coal at Newcastle, and also in the carriage rates
from that port to Viotoria. The fact is, so far as I can
judge, that the miners have been clamoring for a trifle
more pay per ton for hewing coal, and at last they have
got it, and no consumer of coal has the least thought of
saying it nay. They have got a rise of 3d. per ton, and
to pay this the price of coal here is raised all round a
matter of 2s. per ton. Thus the miner gets 3d., and the
colliery proprietor and carrier of coal Is. 9d., while the
oonsumer gets the privilege of paying.
A statement is being insidiously circulated
by the N.S.W. Cabbage-tree mob that the Federal
oapital cannot be nearer to Sydney than 200 miles.
They point out that 100 miles square of land is to
be handed over to the Commonwealth. The new
capital will be located at the remoter side of this
100 miles, which, with the 100 miles mentioned in
the clause as amended, will make 200 for the real
distance of the site. To twist 100 square miles
(which is ten miles square) to 100 miles square is
quite on a par with the tactics employed against
the original Bill.
The residents of Bundaberg have got up a
local address to Charles Powers, signed by all
opposed to Labor-leader Glassey, requesting
Powers to stand. Powers will stand and may
possibly beat the Labor man, especially as a
FREE AND INDEPENDENT ELECTOR: “ Are you in favor
of imposing a tax on cereals? ”
CANDIDATE: “ Yes! I would put a tax of one hundred
pounds on every Chinaman who comes into the
country .”
leading politician named Michael Duffy will work
tooth and nail against Glassey, not because he
cares a tick about Powers, but because, as pointed
out in Louis Garvin’s Fortnightly Review
article, every Irish politician is possessed by the
spirit of retaliation—and Glassey ousted Duffy
from Parliament.
During 1898, according to the estimates,
the population of N.S.W. increased 22,780;
Maoriland, 14,407 ; Queensland, 13,833; Westra-
lia, 6242; Tasmania, 5623; S.A., 4890; while
Victoria decreased 748. Probably the census, due
in 1901, will shake up a lot of these estimates,
however. Last census showed that Queensland,
Tasmania, and N.S.W (especially the first two)
had largely over-estimated their increase, while
Westralia and Victoria were about right. But
not one of the crowd had guessed its population
much below the real figure.
Premier Kingston has a start over most
S.A. politicians owing to his remarkable blend of
blood. Once he was tackled by an irate Scottish
deputation, and completely thwarted it by the
reminder that the blood of the Camerons coursed
through his veins. At the approaching election
he will probably scrape in for West Adelaide
owing to the fact that the Kingston blood on his
father’s side is Irish—a great consideration in W.
Adelaide, which is almost entirely a R.C. consti-
tuency. And the time may arrive when the S.A.
Premier’s De Silva strain will come in handy.
The attempts of Brisbane Courier and
Telegraph to make poor, dull, commonplace,
spineless, oily-gammon Premier Dickson a strong
man are indeed pathetic. First, Courier calls
upon the prosy one to stand or fall for Federa-
tion ; and then Telegraph —which is much more
concerned about men than principles—feels (Confi-
dent that a commanding statesman —ye gods !
like Dickson will reorganise his Cabinet before
facing the country. And all the time the weak,
bald, dull-eved, nineteen-a-penny Premier sits
flabbergasted and irresolute. When Dickson left
rent-collecting he should have taken to street-
preaching, not politics.
It is officially announced that the first
batch of Q. elections will take place on Saturday,
March 11. On that date 12 single and 7 double
electorates will be contested, and a Leperland
prophet, who has studied the political barometer,
prognosticates that the Dickson Govt, will fall
heavily in the mud. Although the first batch
selected are understood to be sure Govt, seats—
picked to influence subsequent contests —the
prophet has wagered that Labor and Opposition
will come out on top—he even cherishes the belief
that Dickson will be unseated by his Labor
opponent, and Ministers Foxton, Dahymple and
Chataway sent to political Siberia.
Dr. MacLaurin, M.L.0., is angry because
Sydney has been barred, as if it was a noxious
trade or a tick district, or a quarantined dog,
from being the Federal capital. The pawky
doctor discourses thus :
We are asked to consent to a provision which will
practically declare that the influence of Sydney is so
malign that for all time the seat of government of Austra-
lia shall never be allowed to be within 100 miles of it; and
this is what we are asked to request the British Parlia-
ment to embody in a solemn Act as the fundamental Con-
stitution of Australia. What has Sydney done to Mr.
Reid that he should seek to affix such a stigma to a city
which, most people think, has treated him with the
greatest consideration and kindness?
Yet the agreement which fixes the capital in
N.S.W. thereby decrees that it shall not be within
150 miles of Melbourne, 150 miles of Adelaide,
400 miles of Hobart, or 1500 miles of Perth. And
they aren’t cursing in this dreadful fashion about
being regarded as lepers who must give the
Federal city a wide berth.

The Duke of Cambridge attributes his
longevity to “an active life and plenty of work.”
As a young man he started to draw £12,000 a year
for being Queen Victoria’s cousin. That kept him
busy until he undertook the further responsibility
of commanding the British Army (on paper) for
another huge fixed sum per annum and perquisites.
Also, he became Ranger of Windsor Park, and
from time to time lie laid a foundation-stone, in
addition to going abroad for the benefit of his
health. At present he is actively employed in
dodging the English winter. Next month, as
likely as not, he will devote his energies to carry-
ing out the instructions of his medical adviser.
Gamp ridge has been an ardent toiler all his life,
and The Bulletin expects him to die in harness.
The Labor-party won every seat at Broken
Hill municipal elections, and now controls the
Counoil. But it only put forward a go-slow
policy; if it were all carried into effect Broken
Hill would still have only about a quarter as many
municipal enterprises as an average English city.
Mostly the party confines itself to a demand for a
publio water-supply, public lighting scheme
(“ Tattersall ” Adams, by the way, owns the ex-
isting electric-lighting system there), abattoirs,
markets, cool storage chambers and baths. For
the rest it wants the Mayor to give accounts of
his expenditure just like any other officer, allow-
ing him .£2OO for his own time. This, perhaps, is
the first time a Labor-party in Australia has got
control of a public governing body. And its
leader celehrated the occasion by sending an
opponent, who had remarked that he was a liar,
to the hospital for a week or two with a cracked
skull.

Listen to the voice of the only Hoolan on
Cairns harbor : “ The commercial eye floats on it
with ravenous appetite ; the artistic eye is absorbed
in contemplation.” (So, apparently, is the poli-
tical eye.) “The former can see every con-
venience for extending commerce; the latter
beholds a glorious panorama of placid sea, a level
foreshore of sand, and a background of Nature’s
handiwork, bold mountains and pyramidal peaks.”
Nothing about the Chows in the foreground, Japs
in the background, lepers in the canebrake, and
smellful aliens in charming übiquity. . . . No
wonder Cairns wants to hug John Plumper to her
maternal bosom.
“ Tiini ” : A word or two re the Federal
capital. The site should be in southern NS. W.,
as far away as possible from any existing town.
The location, in fact, ought to be Crown lands, or
uniniproved private lands resumed at as near
prairie value as can be managed. The Common-
wealth should- not part with the freehold of a
single foot of the land of the Empire City or the
territory surrounding it, but should lease it in
perpetuity, with re-valuations several times in the
century, the lessee merely being allowed the value
of his improvements. Thus, the unearned incre-
ment of a city that will spring into populous
existence at once will not go to satisfy the cravings
of earth-hungry monopolists, but will become
the ever-increasing revenue of the Commonwealth.
With this princely endowment all the public build-
ings of the capital can be erected, the parks laid
out, and sewerage, water-supply and lighting pro-
vided, and without a single penny of expense to
the States, and without doing the slightest injus-
tice to anyone.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page

Ttie World’s Best: Blood Purifier.
DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS
Cure Boils, Blotches, Pimples, and all Shin Diseases.
His Clothes a Torture.
A GLANVILLE RESIDENT CURED OF
BOILS AND RHEUMATISM BY DR.
MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS.
Mr. J. H. Davies, Carlisle-street, Glanville
(S. A.), is a thirty years’ resident of Port Adelaide.
He writes to state the benefit derived from using
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, after doctors and
medicines had all failed. “For ten months I have
suffered intensely from bods and rheumatism,
which caused me so much pain that wearing my
clothes was a torture to me. Of course I tried
very many different medicines, and consulted
doctors, but my complaint seemed to be beyond
them, as they (none of them) did me any good
whatever. I was thoroughly disheartened, and
dreaded to think of the years of agony that seemed
to lie before me. Every new medicine I heard of
was tried, and not long ago Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills was being advertised as a blood
purifier, and after reading one of the books I
resolved to give them a trial, but with very little
hope they would prove different to anything I had
yet taken. I bought a bottle from Mr. Madge,
the chemist in the city, and he spoke very highly
of them. Well, they cured me thoroughly. From
the very first dose my pains began to go, and be-
fore long I felt perfectly well. In all, I have
taken three bottles. I will be glad to see anybody
wishing to know all about these pills, and I will
tell them all they have done for me. They should
prove a boon to sufferers in South Australia, and
I advise anybody who suffers to give them a trial,
as they are the best pill that is made, without the
shadow of a doubt.”

A “Long Lane” Ended.
A FEW YEARS’ DESPAIR SUCCEEDED
BY JOY THROUGH USING DR.
MORSES INDIAN ROOT PILLS.
They say it is a long lane which has no ending,
but the sad truth is that too many only end it by
death. Mr. Dillon, land and estate agent, Bris-
bane, at one time thought that his lane could only
end the same way, but the fact should be wel-
comed like the light of dawn to learn that he ter-
minated the bad time by gaining health and
happiness. He says : “ Having suffered for
several years from biliousness and a sluggish liver,
I tried several remedies claiming to be certain
cures for these complaints ; but they did me no
good. At last I tried Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills, and have only taken one bottle, and am
more than well satisfied with the results. They
hate done me far more good than any medicine I .
have ever taken. Y"ou have my permission to use
this letter just as you think tit for the good of
those who suffer.”
Haunted by Disease.
FIVE YEARS OF A WOMAN’S LIFE.
THE GRIM SPECTRE SPIRITED OFF BY
DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS.
The facts are related by Mrs. Millie Pearson, 18
Waterloo-street, Surry Hills, N.S.W. :—“I have
been suffering from severe pains in both sides. It
has caused me much misery for five years. When
rain hung about, the agony became unendurable,
and I could not take proper exercise or do my work.
I tried many remedies, and. six months ago, saw a
doctor, but nothing did me any good. A short
time ago I took some Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills, and the first dose gave me great relief. In
fact, since then I have not felt any pains return,
and my health is excellent. They are the most
wonderful remedy, and I recommend them to all
as such —indeed, they have made me a new
woman.”
Carried Home in Agony.
DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS
EFFECT A CURE.
Mr. Robert Geoff (employed at Cameron’s
Tobacco Factory) resides at No. 20 Little Gipps-
street, Surry Hills, N.S.W.
“My wife has been troubled with a nervous
headache for the past three years, and she used
several kinds of medicine, but received little or no
benefit. It was then that I heard of the wonder-
ful cures wrought by Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills, and, in consequence, I bought a bottle. She
took them according to directions, and is now
entirely recovered. As to my case, I cannot speak
too highly of this medicine. I think there is
nothing to equal them. I suffered with pains in
my sides and stomach, which have often occasioned
me to fall in the street, and to be picked up and
carried home. The Pills cured me. They shall
always have a place in my home, as I consider
them a blessing to humanity.”

When Science Failed.
DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS
PROVED A HAPPY SUCCESS.
Mrs. Frank Grant, Girilatnbone, near Nyngan,
N.S.W., writes : “I have been suffering for some
time with my head and stomach, and tried many
doctors, but without any good result. I have
found that Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills have
done me a deal of good, and I recommend them to
all my friends, who all praise them ”
Enduring Tortures for Pour
Years-
Mrs. Stone, of 33 Foveaux-street, Surry Hills,
N.S. W., gives her case to our reporter to be used
in the interest of those who suffer as she has done.
“For the past four years,” she says, “I have
suffered tortures from dyspepsia. I could not
digest any solid food and was unable to eat a
hearty meal. I was always buying indigestion
cures, but obtained no relief. I fully expected to
be an invalid for life, as I was gradually growing
worse. A friend brought me some of Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills, and asked me to try them. I
did so, and, after taking one bottle, I feel a
different woman. I can sleep and eat a hearty
meal once more, and, after four years’ torture, I
feel that life is worth living, and it is solely due to
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills.”
Slipping Up Death.
ACCOUNT OF HOW A MAN WRESTLED
WITH DEATH AND SECURED
FIRST FALL.
We do not know if Mr. W. J. O'Brien, Junee
Reefs, N.S. W., is an athlete, but we do know that
he has performed a phenomenal feat with a little
assistance—assistance, we might say, small enough
to swallow. He writes : “ I have much pleasure
in testifying to the quality of Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills. I was working in the mines, and got
leaded, and went to the doctor, who could give me
no relief. I also tried many patent remedies,
which also failed, and made sure my time to go
would soon come, and gave myself up as completely
done for. At last, a mate of mine said, ‘ Here is
something that will cure you, and, if they don’t,
nothing will do you any good.’ He gave me a
bottle of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills. I took
one dose that night, and one next day, and the
result was wonderful. lam happy to say that I
am now quite well, and able to work again, thanks
to Indian Root Pills, only for which I do not think
I’d be alive to-day.”
Scrofula-
Is a disease of the blood. Many inherit it, others
induce it by faulty lives and carelessness. Ulcers,
eruptions, sores, and glanular swellings are its
chief signs. Root it out of your system, for your
own sake and for your children’s sake. It flies
before Morse’s Indian Root Pills like the foul
miasma before the mountain breeze.
A Timely Rescue.
MEDICAL SKILL AVAILED HIM NOT
Mr. Abel White, of Olinda, Rylstone, N.S.W.,
writes : —“ I have been suffering from an enlarged
liver and indigestion for five or six years. I was
treated by several doctors, but only obtained
relief for the time, and had to be continually taking
medicine. I commenced the use of Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills, and since taking a few bottles
of them the pain I used to feel in my right side
has disappeared. I can now eat my food without
suffering, and I cheerfully recommend these Pills
to anyone suffering from the liver or indigestion,
as they have cured me. You are at liberty to use
this letter if you wish to do so.”
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
HAVE CURED THOUSANDS, AND
WILL CURE YOU.
One of the roots from which these Pills are made
is a sudorific, which opens the pores of the skin,
and assists nature in throwing out the finer parts
of the corruption within. The second is a plant
which is an expectorant that opens and unclogs
the passage to the lungs, and thus, in a soothing
manner, performs its duty by throwing off the
phlegm and other humors from the lungs by
copious spitting. The third is a diuretic, which
gives ease and double strength to the kidneys ;
thus encouraged, they draw large amounts of im
purity from the blood, which is then thrown out
bountifully by the urinary or water passage, and
which could not have been discharged in any
other way. The fourth is a cathartic, and accom-
panies the other properties of the Pills while en
gaged in purifying the blood ; the coarser particle*
of impurities, which cannot pass by other outlets,
are thus taken up and conveyed off in great
quantities by the bowels.

Dear Bulletin. —In your Xmas number ap-
peared an article describing the Sydney Safe. Deposit,
which, as was pointed out, is one of the sights of Sydney.
I beg to state that the management will be pleased at
any time to receive visits at the vaults from your readers.
The Deposit was erected to provide absolutely secure
storage for deeds, insurance policies, scrips, contracts,
diplomas, and other important documents ; or jewellery,
coin, mining specimens, etc., and visitors can see how far
this has been effected. —Yours, William Epps, manager.

The cure of piles by the new “ Canalin ”
treatment is fully described in the pamphlet,
“Piles, and How to Cure Them,” by Albert
Sharp. Copies, with testimonials, sent free to
any colony from the dep6t, 257 George-st., Sydney.*
Several letters have been received from
lady correspondents with reference to the “Alba-
tross Wick.” All agree that the comfort and
cleanliness are well worth the extra cost, which is
more than saved by the lessened quantity of oil
consumed and in the labor saved, in that they
“ require no trimming.”*
Many Bulletin readers will regret to hear
that when the mail left London on 18th Jan. that
bright artist, B. E. Minns, was in hospital and
about to undergo a severe operation for the re-
moval of what it was hoped would not prove to be
a malignant growth.
The official opening of the just-completed
track down to Govett’s Leap, Blue Mountains,
takes place this Saturday. It has hitherto been
deemed impossible to reach the bottom of this
awful chasm except by a very circuitous route;
the new track, blasted out of the perpendicular
rock, gives direct access to the famous Grose
Valley. Visitors leave Sydney per 820 train.
The Bookfkllow, which threatens to
grow into a full-blown and most readable maga-
zine, is this month published in improved form.

The N.S.W. police were promised a fort-
night’s holiday annually. But they now find that
against this fortnight is to be set the one-dav-a-
month leave hitherto enjoyed by them, so the
net gain will be but two days. The promised
fortnight is thus only Paddy’s blanket leave: cut
off from one end to be sewn on to the other.
President Faure has died suddenly of
apoplexy, and is succeeded by M. Loubet,
another respectable man who will not set the
Seine afire. But it looks as if the Republic were
going to last. And why should it not ? The pre-
sent generation has been suckled in Republican-
ism. To millions of Frenchmen, educated in the
principles of liberty and equality in Republican
schools, it would seem utterly absurd and gro-
tesque to have an emperor or a king : just as it
would seem absurd and grotesque to us in Aus-
tralia to choose an emperor or a king from our
midst. Say, if Australia had to choose a king
(and a royal family) from among her own citizens,
whom would she select ?
Old David Blair, the father of Australian
journalism, died last Saturday at Armadale (Mel-
bourne), aged 79 years. Probably no one among
the profession which pursues unprofitable ink and
paper in these provinces was better know n, or will
be more regretted. He came to Sydney in 1850,
and helped Parkes to found the Empire. He was
connected with the Sydney Morning Herald
and the Argus; edited the Age for a while
in the diggers’ interest at the time when a
diggers’ insurrection was looming; was a mem-
ber of Parliament for a numl er of years,
and rejected sundry portfolios in different
Victorian Ministries. Also, he did more-'Other
things than there is space to record. He was
a powerful writer, as well as a scholarly one,
and his tendency to write the whole truth, and to
do it with a sledge-hammer, filled his life with
many troubles. He enjoyed the troubles, too.
In the more conservative days of Victoria,
when the eminent citizens who were found
out in 1893 still smote themselves proudly
on the front stomach and talked of their
unblemished character, it used to rain libel writs
or threats of the same over David Blair’s front
gate, and epistles demanding retraction of the
slur cast on some serious and eminently respect-
able institution blew into his door like leaves in
autumn. For the last ten years or so of his life
he was partially paralysed, and his sufferings at
times were intense, but his mental vigor lasted
through it all. According to all medical pre-
cedent he should have died long ago, but the
veteran kept himself alive for years mainly by
force of will. If The Bulletin had a flagstaff
and a flag it would half-mast the latter to Mr.
Blair’s memory. Most of the people to whom
such distinctions are usually paid leave a far
smaller gap than the brave and able old jour-
nalist.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
lattersall Adams advertises that he will not
for the future voluntarily send wires to the drawers of
likely starters, so that the blackmailing horse-owner will
not get the address of his possible victim from this source.
Also—which is a weak and impotent conclusion—that
when the blackmailing horse-owner does get at his victim,
and tiie latter instructs “ Tattersall ” to hand over part
of the money to the grabster who owns-the alleged noble
animal, Tatt. will not, under any circumstances, pay the
latter more than one-fifth of the prize. What possible
right the blackmailer his to even one-fifth “ Tattersall ”
doesn’t explain. Moreover, “ Tattersall,” by taking steps
to restrict blackmailing, plainly acknowledges that it is
an evil ; and he lias it in his power to largely, if not
absolutely, wipe out the evil by announcing that lie won’t
pay one solitary copper of the prize-money to anybody
except the holder of the ticket ; also that lie won’t con-
nive at any horse-owner exacting tribute to the extent of
one-fifth or one-hundredth or any other proportion—yet,
somehow he doesn’t do it. The time has come, as The
Bulletin has said over andover again, for “Tattersall” to
absoi utely wash his hands of the horse-owner and consider
only the interests of the general public who find the
money for the sweeps.
Of course, “ Tattersall ” only pays over a portion
of the prize upon the drawer’s instructions, but he knows
well enough that these instructions are not given volun-
tarily. It is not in human nature to give away a heap of
money for nothing. No prize-drawer would part with
even a fifth of his winnings to the horse-owner unless he
knew that, through “Tattersall’s” neglect in the past, this
had developed into a recognised steal, and it had come to
be acknowledged that a horse-owrier wouldn’t go straight
unless paid to do so. The instructions to pay over part
of the prize to the horse-owner are not voluntary instruc-
tions, but are extorted by fear and by tacit threats.
Even when the drawer runs after the horse-owner
with an offer of a bit to nothing it is a case of
extortion and terrorism and blackmail just the same.
The drawer wouldn’t run after any owner to offer him
money gratis unless he knew that the owner probably
wouldn't go straight without it. Therefore, why doesn’t
“Tattersall” refuse tohaveany thing to do with the iniquity?
His contract is to draw the sweep honestly and pay over
the prizes, and if he connives at or assists in, or in even
the remotest way countenances, the extortion of anything
from the drawer by the horse-owner, he is indirectly aid-
ing and abetting a system that hasn’t one good feature to
recommend it.
Indirectly as well as directly the “bit to
nothing” system is an injury to “ Tattersall’s ” clients.
When a man draws a horse, and the owner demands, say,
a fifth of the prize else the animal won’t start, and he
gets it per medium of “ Tattersall," and the horse wins,
and the prize-drawer scoops, say, £BOOO out of the £lO,OOO
prize, it is customary to point out that it is a lot
better to get £BOOO than nothing. Also that if thedrawer
hadn’t laid the owner the other £2OOO he would have got
nothing—therefore, the system is really good enough
after all. But if that “ bit to nothing” hadn’t been laid,
and that, horse hadn’t started, some other animal would
have won, and some other man got the prize. And
“Tattersall,” when he helps one client to improve his
chances by giving special inducements to the owner, also
helps to deprive some other client of the chance he would
otherwise have had. And he is supposed to give all his
clients an equal show. If the writer drew horse No. 2,
and one of his legitimate chances lav in the fact that the
owner of horse No. 1 didn't intend to start, and the
latter was induced to start(and win) because “ Tattersall ”
offered him, whether by the drawer's request or other-
wise, a certain sum of money—well, this scribe, in his
wrath, would call on “Tattersall,”and call hitnan interfer-
ing old man who helped one of his clients to gain a mean
underhand advantage of another.

Some recent startling “reversals of form ” by
jumping-horses from the Miller (Melb.) stable—the ease
of Iramoo was a particular startler—have called attention
to the fact that somebody in authority inspires the para-
graphs which appear in the Argus and Age when a “ re-
versal ” calls for explanation. The paragraphist simply
repeats the stable narrative, with full detailsas to private
trials, amiable differences of opinion between owner and
Jockey, and so forth, but without a word of comment on
the reasonableness, or otherwise, of the carefully im-
parted information. Instead of regarding things from
the outside public’s point of view and bringing his own
expert knowledge to bear upon them, exclusively or
otherwise, when he writes his notice the newspaper re-
porter merely serves as a mouthpiece for the person who
objects to have unpleasant remarks passed upon his busi-
ness. The little men among owners complain that
whereas they are judged by the character of their horses’
performances and are made to look queer every time an
uncertain gee-gee doesn't do its best, the in-and-out run-
ning of a big man’s horses is judged by “the owner’s
well-known character for uprightness.” And The Bulle-
tin reckons that the little men have a grievance. Horse-
reporters should write only of what they see in public
performances, extenuating nothing, nor setting down
aught in malice. The pleasant little statements published
on behalf of upright owners are true, no doubt, but if
they are not satisfactory—if they don’t clear up the
mystery in an extraordinary “ reversal of form,” such as
Iramoo lately showed—they merely provoke the exclama-
tion “ Rats 1 ” from sceptical readers.

As usual, the Long stable is causing punters
much anxiety. A week or so hack people who had early
got on to the stable’s good things for the Newmarket
were jubilant, hut their stock is down, as at time of
writing Hopscotch and Beachcomber had not started for
the seat of war. Also Hopscotch appears in the entries
for the Stewards’ Plate, to be run at Randwick on the
same day as the Newmarket. The Hon. “ Bill ” must be
fairly revelling in the fun. ,

Bobadil, on Saturday, ran away with the Caul-
field £2OOO Futurity Stakes in the “ common canter ”
style, which was regarded with awe previous to V.R.C.
Derby. Everybody will say now that this Bobadil is the
real Bobby, and not the same fellow whom Grafter and
Cocos downed in the Spring. All the same, The Bulletin
will expect the little free-and-easy galloper to fail when
asked to make a great performance over a longer course.
Bar Wait-a-Bit and Revenue there was nothing
much for the St. Alban’s champion to beat on Saturday.
The rumor that Wait-a-Bit had been sore of late was
borne out by his racing in the 7-furlongs race ; and
Revenue, starting at 8 to 1, dropped away beaten, appar- ;
ently, as soon as the favorite rushed to the front.
Revenue will have to improve very much on this “ form ”
to distinguish himself at the autumn meeting, for
although he had the worst of the weights'with everything
except the winner, a few pounds more or less should
make little difference to such a strapping youngster.
Condiment, from N.S.W., upset a hot pot in
Wilson’s Rona for the Alma Stakes. Rona got off
well, and was sailing along like a certain winner till
Laniond’s filly got suddenly in front—and stayed there.
The Kooyong Welter Handicap was encouraging
for the people who have taken North British to win the
Newmarket. The Gozo gelding—now in his fifth year,
the age when the Gozo stock ripens—won his race in bril-
liant style and good time, considering the lOst. 31b. on
his back. Among the beaten ones who carried no money
was Wild Olive, a mare much whispered as a likely winner
of the Newmarket. But, if the Olive is to beat North
British at Fleinington, her “ reversal of form ” will be
awfully startling.
• * * *
Two starters for a mile-race at Mentone (Melb.)
the other Saturday, and yet the winner was objected to
for interfering with his only opponent at the home turn.
The stewards didn’t fall in with the suggestion that the
interference was intentional. But the Aon mentioned
the suggestion in a casual way, as though there were not
an awful moral hanging to it.

Although the rich Newmarket Handicap is to
be run in a week’s time, yet there is little genuine specu-
lation on what, at one time, was one of the* heaviest
betting races in Australia. If Stand Off keeps on pro-
gressing, he may land this important race for N.S.YV.,
though he will find his compatriots, Cabin Boy and Beach-
comber, formidable opponents. Reaper, Novus, and
Veneda seam to be the most formidable of the Victorian
candidates, whilst S.A. swears by Security and Blood-
stone.

Bobadil looks at present likely to start an un-
precedentedly hot favorite for the Australian Cup. Of
outsiders likely to upset him, Heretic, Longford, or Ale-
mene seem the most promising.

The lesson of the inquest at Granville (N.S.W.),
on the dead body of the staked jockey, Albert Montgom-
ery, should not be forgotten, either by people who control
horse-racing in country towns or “ the authorities. ” The
evidence of a jockey who rode in the fatal Hack Race and
wasn’t killed—one Busch, of Rouse Hill—was to the
effect that the course at Prospect had been condemned
by some of those most interested in the question as to its
safety (the riders) and a catastrophe had been predicted.
A light fence skirted the inside of the running track for
the last 200 or 300 yards of the half-mile course. What
sort of fence this was was proved by the terrible exhibit
at the inquest—a blood-stained, ugly-looking end of a
sapling, about 2in. thick and 4ft. or so long (it had been
broken off as the horse carried the doomed jockey along
with it impaled in his thigh). Busch said that the fence
sagged in and out, and a horse, hugging it at one place,
must hit a promontory a little farther on. Montgomery’s
mare hit it; a mil fell down a few yards in front of her,
the heavy end inside and down, and the light end out on
to the line of the course and up. Thus was the boy
staked. He rode for some hundreds of yards with that
fearful, clumsy spear of fate protruding from his body.
It had gone in Bin., and it took some expenditure of
strength from two boys to get it out. At some places,
race meetings are “ rigged up” to make a day’s trade at
the local pub. In such cases—and always—it should be
someone’s business to guard against possible man-
slaughter.

In connection with N.S.W. rep. cricketers’
score of 353 for 6 wickets against the second eleven, it
must be noted that the former were principally opposed
by their own practice bowlers. The fielding of the second
eleven was wretched, Donnan, who got 120, being badly
missed at 2, while Truinper was let off no fewer than
three times in his very shakily-got 43. The fielding of
the first eleven also was none too bright, and the selectors
will soon he compellecTSo throw out a couple of the best
batsmen if they don’t improve in their fielding. A player
who compiles 50 runs, and then goes into the field and
scores a hundred for the other side, can easily be done
without.

There was a medium attendance at the Charley
Bannerinan benefit last Saturday on Sydney Cricket
Ground. About £127 was taken at the gate during the
two days, and as another £lOO may be added from the
subscription list, the popular old-timer will receive a sub-
stantial sum to start him on his English tour. Both
sides had a day’s batting ; the first N.S.W. eleven closing
its innings, when six wickets were down, for 353, as
against the second eleven’s total of 250 for 8 wickets.

Dear Bulletin. — Re the Austral-Anglo team.
Some S.M. Herald correspondents are barracking lustily
for Duff as second wicket-keeper. But, without wishing
to detract from-that brilliant young field and promising
bat’s performances, let me say it’s a long step from
twelfth man in N.S.W. to thirteenth in an Australian
team. Judging from form displayed in Sydney, no
further selection can come from South Australia, bar
Giffett—and he was a comparative failure last trip, and is
probably a back number, from whom only in-and-out
form can in future be expected. Victorian averages are
inflated by their two wet-wicket victories in Melbourne ;
they had the luck to have the best of the wicket against
N.S.W., to have a perfect wicket themselves, and to send
S.A. in twice on a bad one. Graham was unreliable last
trip, and his rheumatism may recur at any time. Giller’s
87 and 55 at Sydney are discounted by the chances he
gave in the first effort. At 15 both M’Kibbin and Kelly
appealed for leg-before against him, and Kelly-does not
appeal without cause. The final five should be Iredale,
Truinper, Howell, M’Kibbin, and Johns, with Giller as
fourteenth man.—Enthu.
* • • *
“M. 8.”: A section of the public clamors for
the exclusion of Johns to make room for, say, Duff in the
XI. Arguments : (1) That a second wicket-keeper is not
needed; (2) that Duff comes from N.S.W. If Johns is
not to go, his supplanter must be an equally good wicket-
keeper. Should Kelly meet with an accident on the eve
of a test-match our team will be beaten if they play 11
first-class batsmen (all splendid bowlers) and no'good
wicketkeeper. And for an individual contest Johns is as
clever behind the sticks as Kelly.

Matter for comment in Adelaide : that Geo.
Giffen is practising assiduously, despite his assertion
that, if not selected for the Australians, he will not play
for the second team.

Wrestlers are very peculiar people—they always
were. Too many tricks about them, as a rule—which is
why their sport does not long thrive anywhere. The
game is a good one—essentially British in every respect—
not that that fact makes much difference for or against.
Here is an instance of the queer way “ rastlers” have of
doing things. Days before Harry Dunn reached Sydney,,
brawny-limbed Harry Cansdell challenged the tal(, mus-
cular American middle-weight, Lucifer, to a match..
Lucifer agreed. Later Cansdell put up a deposit and
signed articles. Lucifer refrained from going that far,
offering various excuses the while, until heavy-weight
(Hist.) Harry Dunn arrived on the scene. Then the
American, ignoring his pledges to Cansdell, forthwith
made a match with the big fellow. Cansdell remon-
strated. Lucifer promised he would meet him after-
wards. Dunn won after an apparently desperate struggle.
Cansdell pointed out to the Yank the mistake of going
4st. or sst. above his class, and claimed consideration.
Lucifer put him off insisting that he must have a return
match with Dunn for sweet satisfaction’s sake. The pair
got together once more, but the array of empty benches
showed that the public weren't taking any. Dunn won
again. Cansdell chipped in at this stage, reminding
Lucifer that his (Cansdell’s) money was still waiting to be
covered. More promises from the Yankee “marvel,’ but
nary a fulfilment. Now Lucifer, cornered, proposes a
match in private for £5 or £lO a-side, knowing that Cans-
dell would have to leave his work to train without the re-
motest prospect of even getting enough to pay expenses
—leaving compensation for loss of wages out of the
question altogether. Mark the peculiarity of the Ameri-
can’s attitude. He readily agreed to meet a 16st. world-
beater twice, and yet evades an list, man whose reputa-
tion is purely local. Is it that he despises Cansdell ? He
can’t afford to do so. Anyhow, he is lucky if he can
afford to despise Oansdell’s money, which is there for him.
The Bst. 71b. novice boxing-tournament, con-
cluded in Sydney on Saturday night, supplied heaps of
rough play and some exciting situations, but there were
no embryo Foleys, Fitzsimmonses, or Peter Jacksons
among the fighters. Buckley won, though all through
the preliminary rounds there seemed no possibility of his
landing the money. Writer was amazed at the big ap-
pearance of some of the 8.7 men. Three at least were
141 b. heavier than the weight named, while one or two
more looked every oz.—and admitted it, too—of lOst.

Strong man Sampson’s unexpected advent in
Sydney last Saturday started further talk re the challenge
of leviathan turfman Oxenham and retired champion
pugilist Foley to, combined, pull a tug-of-war against the
man of muscle for £lOO a side. Provided Sampson means
business, there seems some probability of the match
being made. Foley and Oxenham pooh-poohed the idea
of any single individual, however strong, being able to
shift two healthy, brawny men totalling something over
30st. In which connection Foley refers to the tug-of-
war of schoolboys ; two little ’uns—one on the other’s
back —would easily beat the biggest boy on the play-
ground. Sampson has another opportunity offered him ;
a well-known racehorse-owner undertakes to back an
unknown against the strong man at scralch-pulling for a
big stake, and has put up a substantial deposit.

A few more fights like that between Fred. Pres-
ton and Tim Murphy, at Melb. Vic. Hall on Saturday
night, and boxing will boom. Murphy, at 10.7, gave
away 2st. He is a lanky, thin, but symmetrical brother
of “Torpedo” Billy Murphy, but has the hitting power of
a heavy-weight. Preston, older and 2in. shorter, is all
thickness and muscle, but has a fair reach and far more
staying power than the other. It was this staying power
that won him 75 per cent, of the biggest gate in Melb. for
years. Fifteen ding-dong rounds were fought, and the
question now is—Where in Australia is the man who can
meet Murphy at 10.7 ?

Another swimming record broken. Last week
at Sydney Government Printing Office carnival “Mud”
Bishop, the big Balmain sprinter, emphasised his defeat
of Lane in the 100yds. championship at Balmain on
Boxing Day, by again downing the speedy little ex-
Grammar-school boy over the same distance and under
similar conditions—fresh water and a short bath. The
struggle was most exciting—neck-and-neck for 54yd.,
Bishop a yard in front at 81 (the laps were 27yd. in
length). Over the last 19yd. Lane strained every nerve
and brought every ounce to bear. Result, Bishop the
winner with less than 2ft. (reach and all) to the good.
Time, lmin. 3 4-ssec.—a new Australasian record—lsec.
better than the previous best, and 2sec. faster than when
Bishop beat Lane before.

Last Saturday the chief Sydney swimming
event was Balmain Club’s carnival, at which R. Craig,
last year’s winner, again carried off the 220yds. local
amateur championship. Next Saturday West-Sydney

when, in the 100yds. invitation scr. race,Bishop and Lane
again meet—this time in salt water.

Charles Fraser, a leading member of Ballarat
(Vic.) Cricket Club, was killed the other day by a blow on

perhaps, of bowls. Yet F. Josephsou nearly died the
other day from joy when he carried off the Sydney bowl-

The Bulletin regrets to hear that N.S. Wales

Cycling is much on the down-grade in S.A.
The 'meeting, ending on Saturday, has been a financial
failure, despite splendid racing and fine weather. With
such champions as Walne (who won the mile champion-
ship by an incli or two from Don Walker), Carpenter,
Walker, Jackson, and Lewis, brought specially over, a
big profit was anticipated, but the public were lukewarm,
and the League balance from past meetings had another
hole knocked in it. One great reason is the strange fact
that S. A. has no local champions worth pitting against
Eastern cracks.

The pugilist is still prevented by law from
having his pretty little nose damaged ; while the cyclist
continues to cut himself to ribbons and fill all the vacant

last Saturday. In one race six men played sacks-on-the-
mill, one being thrown right over the fence, landing on
top of a boy. Bruce turned a somersault and fell with
his face on the top wire of the fence, whilst Hamilton was
badly cut about. In the next heat M’Leod and Green-
wood fell—Batson’s machine went clean over M’Leod’s
neck, and Batson came down heavily, his left arm and
right collarbone being badly smashed.

John Roberts can’t have gone very much “off ”
in his billiards as yet. In a match, recently, the veteran
lost the white when he had made 14, and then ran the

into the middle and top pockets. Such performances
were unknown when Roberts was a young man.

The Bulletin’s London correspondent : The
Sydney “few friends and admirers” who presented John
Roberts, of cue fame, with a claret jug and a pair of
goblets on 9th Dec., 1878, will be glad or sorry to hear
that £8 12s. 9d. was their “knock-down” price at J. R.’s
sale of his trophies. The Billiards Challenge Cup with
winners’ names for 20 years engraved on —the push pro.
finally foreclosed on it in 1890—fell for £34. Another
champion in his yellow leaf wants “chalk” badly.


A young man recently tried in Sydney for

holy men by prigging fruit from an adjoining
orchard. To all which a sceptical jury said
“ Guilty I”—and he went up for seven years.

That Belarbagil affair is a bad knock to
the N.S.W. public-school system. One Wilkins,
State school-teacher at Belarbagil, was convicted
at last Dubbo Sessions of an abominable offence
committed against a boy aged 10. The offence
had been committed many times. It transpired
in evidence that eight male scholars had been
morally ruined—the offences being continuously
committed, week in and week out, for nearly three
years. One of the witnesses said he had taken
part in unmentionable deeds “ hundreds of times
—more than 200 ; perhaps 500 times.” The extra-
ordinary part of the story is that though the boys
joked amongst themselves about the proceedings,
yet they kept the fearful business from their
parents ; and it was only when a little chap point-
blank refused to go to school on a certain Monday,
giving ashis reason that “to-day ismy turn, dad,”
that there was brought about a revelation of how
things were going in the public school at Belarbagil.
Wilkins has gone to penal servitude for life. At
the same court another pub. school-teacher (a
good-looking young woman) pleaded guilty to
uttering a forged cheque. She got the benefit of
the First Offenders Act.

The present loudest groan of the N.S.W.
parochial gang is that the Federal Parliament is
to meet in Melbourne to choose the Federal city
(in N.S.W.), and that it may never select any
Federal city but simply go on meeting in Mel-
bourne for ever, thereby making it the capital
after all. Of course, the Federal Government
couldn’t stay in Melbourne permanently with-
out building public offices, barracks, Parlia-
ment House and the like; and the idea of N.S.W.
and Queensland, which will command about half
the votes in the Lower House, putting up the
needful cash is utter rot. And the collection of
foolish drapers and other importers who talk
this awful stuff know that it is rot. It,
like most of the other possibilities, is based
on the assumption that all the peoples
of Australia, save only the pure and noble
Cornstalk, are rogues and swindlers, which is
rather interesting from the only province whose
Parliament deliberately broke faith over the
Federal compact. Also, it further implies that
Victoria has so earned the love and gratitude, and
N.S.W. the detestation, of the other provinces
that they will all stand by Victoria as a matter of
course. In fact, it holds up N.S.W. as the lone
ugly leper of the States whom no one will touch or
approach or befriend if he can help it.
Those mealy-mouthed Melb. dailies need

ebolic purposes. The Argus omitted all mention

his wife. The woman had said some pretty hard
things, and the man replied in kind. Ex-editor
Stow, S.M., was “ narked’’.thereat, and he said
still nastier. The local paper printed it all, and
this poor wretch went out and finished himself,
too. But, down to date, no sympathy has been
wasted on him.
Thrift is essentially the virtue of the in-

S.A. Labor-party stresses the alleged tact
that the Kingston Govt, has failed administra-

the opposition to Works Minister Jenkins in
Sturt —where, however, the women’s vote has
made him stronger than ever, his wife, for one
thing, being an enthusiastic canvasser. And
Butler (Education and Agriculture) is being
hailed, too; his offence is that, to allow the
children to go grape-picking, he closes some
schools in the vine-growing districts. “Offering
a premium for the employment of child labor” it
is, of course, called; and at the same time the
W.C.T.U. is given a nudge. But Butler sits for
agricultural Yatala, where direct Labor opposi-
tion would be utterly hopeless.
THE BEAUTY OF THE
SVtASSEY-HARRIS
BICYCLE
Has always been famous. This year
we have Surpassed, all previous
efforts and produced a bicycle as
near perfection as our skill
and the practically unlimited re-
sources of our great factories can
make'it. The design is elegant
and graceful, and every detail
of workmanship and finish has been
brought to tempting ideality.
ONE GRADE ONLY
THAT THE HIGHEST.
We confine our efforts and the efforts
of every one of the 500 skilled
mechanics in our factories to the
perfecting of one model, one
only; and no maker who scatters his
energies over half a dozen models
can hope to compete with us. For
years we have tested, improved and
perfected this one model of
Massey-Harris Bicycle
until, we believe, it is superior in
every way to any other bicycle that
has yet been built.

Did you ever see one? It is as playful and
harmless as a kitten. You might have one

But, beware! Some day it will surely
Bpring, and the fight for life is at hand.
It is just so with a cough. You may carry
one with you for weeks and not think of

the fight will be on, and it is a question which

DR. J. COLLIS BROWNE’S
rHLOROPYNE
'sm
Caution. —Genuine Chlorodyne.
Every bottle of this well-known
Remedy for COUGHS, COLDS,
ASTHMA, BRONCHITIS,
DIARRHOEA, &c., bears on
the Government Stamp the name
of the Inventor—
Pr.J.COLLIS BROWH€.
THE ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS of
Sept. 28, 1895, says:
“ If I were asked which single medicine I should
prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to be
most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say Chi.orodyne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.”
In the Australian mine (Gympie) two large
slabs were being lowered per rope down a shaft.
One of the slabs, catching in the level, got loose,
and fell 500 ft. Two men were working in the
sink at the time, and the slab missed both —but
just grazed the shoulder and hip of one. That
same man will probably go home and break his
neck some day by falling down the steps while
chasing the cat.
The Windeyeresque Justice Hawkins, just
awarded a peerage, retired from the English Bench
after a general newspaper outcry against the in-
ordinate length of his court sittings in criminal
cases. It seems to be a common failing of crimi-
nal Judges to rob accused persons of justice by
rushing their cases through in a manner that
would not be tolerated by parties to civil suits —
or at least by their well-fee’d counsel.
“ Cockney ” to The Bulletin :
The Anglican Church in Victoria is just now suffering
more than ever from the want of a boss bishop who could
work up a subscription boom. And it suffers always
from the scandal of distressed parsons who have shut
their ears to the doctrines of Malthus. The other day
there was a dismal appeal in Melb. Argus on behalf of
the widow and eight children of the Rev. Taylor, a long-
time struggling shepherd in the wilds of Chiltern. Pro-
bably widow Taylor might have had a little money to her
name but for the eight children, and maybe she has
lost a little of her faith in the Good Book which
exhorted her husband to increase and multiply his
species. Her sad case calls fresh attention to the
fact that no Bishop of Melbourne has yet been a lawful
father, in a fleshly way of speaking, therefore it seems to
be about time for an episcopal manifesto, or address,
on the_ question whether the childless consumer
of a big salary is setting a holy example to the
prolific impecunious shepherd, or vice versa ? Is a fully-
commissioned clergyman entitled to as many children as
he can produce, and is.it a blessed thing to produce ’em,
and, if so, why doesn’t his Church provide him —on a
sliding scale—with the means to support them? Amidst
the eternal din of wranglings between R.C.-ism
and Protestantism one listens in vain for the
voice of a celibate R.C. priest who has some-
thing to say concerning Mrs. Taylor and her
eight children—especially the latter. The married
parson and his wife—assuming them to-be powers for
good in this wicked world—are evidently all the more
useful if they don’t hamper themselves with a large
family, or any family at ail. The “increase-and-multi-
ply” text is combated by r sundry sacred remarks on the
virtue of temperance in all things, and—well, is human
nature a moral institution, and ought religion to be
governed by the law of financial prudence, and where
would the point of this yarn come in if it had a point ?
Mr. Panton, P.M., to a Melb. train-con-
ductor who has been assaulted by defendant:
“ We strongly advise you when asking people to
get off to speak civilly—especially to Britishers.
Mr. Panton feels that he can never be sufficiently
grateful to himself for having been born a
Britisher.
TO CURE SORE EYES.
Apply Morris's Imperial Eye Ointment, and
avoid intense suffering. Never be without it.
Over fifty years in use. Refuse all substitutes.
Pots, 2s. Sold everywhere.*
The P. &. O. Co.’s unlucky s.s. China is
berthed just now in Perim. In repairing the
vessel, the many leaks were first well plugged with
tarred oakum, but the workmen would return in a
short time and find all the oakum removed and
the cracks yawning again. Explanation—Huge
crabs had taken out the plugging. Crabs perform
similar feats on boats being repaired in N.Q.
rivers.
The Papuan chief Euamakala, who cot-
toned to ex-Gov. Macgregor, threatens to secede to
barbarism if the big Scot doesn’t return. This
Euamakala keeps an establishment of 34 wives
whose main duty is to provide him with yams.
When he walks abroad the men of his tribe must
speak in whispers and keep their eyes on the
ground. But he doesn’t often walk abroad. He
sits in his hut and yells his orders.

Newcastle Weekly Chronicle, 24/12/’9B:
At the foundation-stone laving of the new children’s

newspaper of the day, a brass plate with the date and
this inscription engraved upon it: “ Norwich population,

SURPRISING CURES AFTER YEARS

Bayswater, Sydney, October, 1898.
W. H. Malyon, Esq., Man. Chemist, Ballarat.
Dear Sir, —For years past (about ten), I have been
troubled with “ Acne ” in its worst form, and have sought
advice from the best Australian and London doctors, with
only fair results. A Victorian friend of mine, some four
or five weeks ago, sent me a tin of your “ Ligmolliene,’'
and speaking very highly of its wonderful curative powers.
I naturally took same “ Cum Grano Salts, ” and was in-
clined not to use it ; eventually I tried your ointment
with truly marvellous results, and am now entirely cured ;
and think people who suffer from skin diseases are greatly
indebted to you for your wonderful remedy. I shall
advise all my friends with skin troubles to use same.
Wishing “ Ligomolliene ” all the success it richly deserves,
Yours faithfully, GEORGE J. O'REGAN.
WHAT THE DOCTORS SAY
Doveton-street, Ballarat,
My dear Mr. Malyon,— August 21 st, IS9S.
With great pleasure I now sit down to record progress
with regard to my old enemy, “ Eczema Capitis,” from
which I suffered, notwithstanding constant treatment for
some years under the prescription of Professor M'Call
Anderson and other eminent dermatologists, with only-
partial and temporary relief. When I met you I com-
menced somewhat sceptically your ointment Ligmolliene,
and after about two months’ treatment I may honestly say
my enemy is defeated, and I am perfectly well. I will only
add that since I commenced the treatment of myself I have
prescribed it to others, and am still doing so with brilliant
results. Please accept my hearty thanks, and remain yours
sincerely, THOS. LE GAY HOLTHOUSE, M.R.C.S., L.

Dear Sir.—l feel it my duty to write and tell you how

I also tried your ALFALIAE UNIVERSAL''PILLS,

which has thoroughly cleaned the scalp and made the

do all that was claimed for them. I have great pleasure

VITADATIO
HAS SAVED HUNDREDS OF LIVES.
IT MAY SAVE YOURS I
Nolan Street, .*
Maryborough (Vic.),
October 26, 1898.
To Mr. S. A. PALMER,
Sole Australian Ag*nt
for IFebberls Vitadatio.
Dear Sir,—When I
went to Melbourne in
February (of -this year)
for a change, after a bad
attack of my. old com-
plaint (the doctors called
it .'congested and en-
larged liver), my bro-
ther said the best thing
I could do was to go
and see you ; but I had
been bad so long, and
although my doctor was
very kind, it seemed as
if nothing could be done
to cure me. But. as I
had known you in New
Zealand, 1 tho u g.h t,
“Well, if Vitadatio has
cured Mr. Palmer, there
must be. some good in
it,” so I decided to see
you and ask your ad-
vice about my case. Of
course, as you are
aware, I was persuaded
to try it, and 1 am very
thankful to Say it has
been a great blessing to
me, as I have passed
the largest gall - stone
my doctor had ever
seen ; the nearest thing
I can compare it to is a
pigeon-egg, and I think
when you see it you
will say I have not ex-
aggerated it. One thing
I feel confident of, and
that is, that Vitadatio
has saved me a very
ration * T Vitadatio to all my friends, several of whom have told me personally
that it has done them a wonderful amount of good. One old lady in particular, seventy-five years
old who has been cured of piles. If you think this will be the means of getting any poor sufferer to
try’ this wonderful medicine, you have my full permission to use it. I will only be too glad to answer
any inquiries relative to my case if a stamped addressed envelope is enclosed for reply Wishing you
everr success in this great business, —I remain, yours faithfully, (Miss) it. J. Il l WIVI A O.

The omnipresent hair-pin ! Last month
somebody found the much-decomposed remains of
a poor beggar who had tried the droughty over-
land trip from the Westralian goldfields to S.A.,
followed the wrong fork of a track, and so struck
a dry tank with an empty billy. Then he just
went into the scrub and died. “The only pro-
perty deceased had,” this is the police-trooper’s
report, “was one billycan, sheath-knife, spoon,
pipe, two sticks of tobacco, two boxes of matches,
one old striped blanket, and a packet of hairpins.”

From art English paper :—
Ever since the death of Eleanor Marx Aveling, ugly
stories have beeh whispered about the manner in which
She caine to take her life. These tales were whispered
when Dr. Aveling was still alive. It is now known that
his sudden death saved him front prosecution. Eleanor
Marx received a letter informing her that the man to
whom she had stood in the position Of wife fdr so many
years had sebretl.V married another \vdhifth. On Aveling
admitting the triitH of this, she, declared that, she Would
bomrriit siiicide, artd not only did the man allow her td
send tot poison, but when it. arrived walked out of the
house. Trie circumstances had been brought to the
knowledge of the Public Prosecutor wheri Dr. Aveling
died. Eleanor Marx left all her property to the fellow
who so cruelly desbrted her. ,It was d ndtable thing
about the Socialist doctor that throughout life, although
a man of most repellent appearance, he exercised a
strange fascination upon women with whom he was
brought into contact.
“Alex. M.” : Some vague suggestion of
the use of blood-hounds in connection with the
Gatton case may render it worth while to note a
misapprehension on this subject. It is probably
the portentous name, “ Wood-hound,” which in-
duces people to suppose that this is an exception-
ally fierce ahd dangerous dog j whereas, though
he can be trained to savageness, and though, as
with any other variety of dog, individual cases of
truculence occur—the bloodhound is not naturally
a specially fierce dog. I once witnessed, in Eng-
land, a trial of the beast’s tracing powers, in
whiph the dog was laid-on by the coat of a man
who (in his shirt-sleeves) had been given half-art-
hour’s start, and who, about an hour later, was
located irt a tree. But, whert he came doWn, the
hound merely srtiffed at him for identification, and
then lay down, apparently satisfied that he had
done his share of the business.

COUGHS, COLDS on the CHEST,
BRONCHITIS & ASTHMA
Rapidly Cured by
Hearne's Bronchitis Cure,
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its
wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of bron-
chitis, distressing cough, difficulty in breathing, hoarse-
ness, pain or soreness in the chest, experience delightful
and immediate relief, and to those who are subject to
colds on the chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete
cure. It is most comforting in allayitig tickling and irri-
tation ih the throat, and giving stfehgth to the voice, and
it nevet allows a cough or asthma to becotne chroflic. No
house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a
dose is generally sufficient, and a complete cure is certain.
“ Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir,—l had a bad attack
of Bronchitis for six months, with dreadful hacking cough
day and night and great quantity of phlegm. Night
sweats Came on and pains in my chest, and I got so weak
that I could not leave my bed. At this stage I was pro-
hounced to be in consumption. I had a lot of medicines
of different kinds, but nothing did me any good until,
reading in the Age of your ‘ Bronchitis Cure,’ 1 got a
bottle, ahd after taking two doses I was much improved.
After taking two bottles the cough and night sweats left
me, my appetite returned, ahd 1 was able to get up ; and
am now in good health, for which I am truly gTateflfl, and
shall recommend your Medicine to all my friends.—Yours
truly, E. SMITIi, Halpin Park, Nhill, Victoria.”
“ After suffering from asthma until I was IT years old,
and having been under a great niadv different treatments,
without benefit, I Was induced to try Hearfie’S Medicine
for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this medicine,
t quite got rid of thfe Asthma, and sirice then, which was
in the beginning of 1883, 14 years ago, I have not had the
Slightest return of it. The Medicine quite curb me, and
I have touch pleasure in recorrimending it.—ALEX; J;
ANDERSON, Geelong, Victoria.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion td obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it was per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
the Rev. John Sinclair, Myers-street, Geelong, and ,59
other leading residents.

prietor, W. G. HEARNE, Chemist, Geelong, Victoria.

It sends a soothing,

_ - current of electricity

penetrating than a linament, more potent than a plaster,
it never fails to relieve the pain and take out the stiffness
and soreness, and, unlike other remedies, it cures perma-
nently. It sends a vigorous circulation of blood through
the weakened muscles and cords that builds up the weak
parts and makes the cure complete. It is the one grand
remedy for weak back. Read all about it in the little

Westralia last year imported 360 tons of
dried fruits —mostly from abroad. Adutyaverag-
ln S £2O a ton will, however, give the splendid
o. W. fruit-country a chance.
Printed, in all soberness, in a Riverina
(N.S. W.) paper that, out on the Paroo, where
J s.P. are few and droughts are many, a squatter
charged a hawker with cutting his fences; that
the hawker successfully defended the action ; but
that the ruling representative of Lawnorder de-
cided that, though the defendant hadn’t been
guilty that time, in case he should be in future he
would be fined .£5 and costs -in default three
months’ gaol. The Bulletin hasn’t any names
or other particulars, though it wants them badly
to knock out either the story or the J.P.
lie prenatal influence, the legless and arm-
less condition of Arthur Kavanagh (long Chair-
man of Committees in the Commons) was by
many attributed to the act of his mother (daughter
of the Duke of Ormond) in breaking the legs and
arms off a statue in the family chapel. Reiated
of Kavanagh that, when his wife expressed fears
that his deformity might be reproduced in their
then unborn child, he drove her to the cottage of
one of his tenants, and had a fine, well-formed
infant produced for inspection. “ There you are,”
he said to his wife, “ I’m that child’s father ! "

Dear Bulletin.—The future Federal capi-
tal shouldbedubbed Antipodea. Thenameis eupho-
nious, hemispherical (if not universal), ancient,
modern, dignified, simple, bombastic, modest,
typical, and generally tiptopical, and therefore
ought to suit all parties. The Commonwealth
aims, or should aim, at becoming the dominant
power in the Southern world, and the name
Antipodea should be emblematic of the Aus-
, tralian claim to dominion on the bottom
half of the planet. A dictionary definition of
“Antipodes ” is“ In geography those who live
on the contrary side of the globe, with their feet
directly opposite to ours.” Apt again; for is it
not our ambition to establish politically as well as
“ contrariness ” to the powers
of the precedent-ridden north ? Our understand-
ings, mental as well as pedal, are braced against
those of the super-equatorial world. Our manners,
government, lack of “ custom,” the country and
its natural phenomena and its position are anti-
podal to them, and we cannot do better than
memorise exultingly the fact by denominating the
first city of our heritage— Antipodea.

Suffered for Years.
BILIOUS FITS
AT REGULAR
INTERVALS
CONQUERED BY
CEEMENTS TONIC
fSu Sydney “ Worker,” July 9th, 1898.)
(BY special investigation.)
Newß of the recovery of Mr. John Blan-
chard from a severe indisposition having
reached our reporter, he made it his business
to obtain a personal interview. Our reporter
saw him at his residence, No. 30 Darling-
hurst-street, Sydney. Mr. Blanchard is an
Imperial pensioner, having served no less
than 25 years with great merit in the
Imperial Navy, and in addition has been in
Government service in this Colony.
“ You are perfectly welcome to the plain
truth about my case,” he said to our
reporter, in answer to a question. “ I only
wonder that people continue to
Suffer from Biliousness
and other liver troubles when there is a
remedy, as it were, knocking at their very
doors, and I shall be only too pleased to let
them know how I was cured, so that they
may obtain the relief that I did. I suffered
for years from indigestion and biliousness.
The bilious fits attacked me at regular
intervals. Often one of these fits would
put me clean out of training and force me to
cease work.”
“ You were something of an athlete then,
Mr. Blanchard, I suppose ?”
“ Yes, I was a sprinter, and now have
£2OO Worth of Trophies
to show as a result of my running ; besides I
have won many heavy money stakes. If I
had only known of Clements Tonic then, I
could have made it of much use to me in my
training, and in combating the bilious turns
to which I was subject, that is, judging by
the very beneficial effect it has had on my
system since. I consulted doctors and they
told me my liver was deranged, and I took
their medicines, but with no effect.”
“ Did you not improve as age increased ?”
“No; on the contrary, I got worse. .A
good deal of my time when in the Navy was
spent in the tropics, both in Africa and at
the islands here, and the climatic condit ions
in those places made my naturally sluggish
Liver More Torpid
than ever. My digestion became impaired
I was obliged to eat hot pickles and cayenne
pepper in considerable quantities, but still
my food would often seem to stick in my
chest and cause me much pain.”
“ What particular symptoms are now
fresh in your memory ?”
“In addition to my indigestion, which
troubled me much at all times, these bilious
attacks repeatedly and unexpectedly seized
me. They would commence with a dull
headache and a sudden disinclination to eat,
in fact, the very sight of food made me feel
sick. I felt irritable and wished to be left
alone, and I felt as tired as though I had
done a hard day’s work. Next day, after a
restless night, I should be worse. My head
then ached intensely across the forehead,
and I was troubled with pains in the back,
between the shoulders.
A Dull, Heavy Feeling
came over me, and I was forced to lie down,
nnable to transact my ordinary business,
not caring to talk, nor even able to read a
newspaper. I tried any number of medi-
cines, in addition to physic prescribed for
me by doctors, but somehow or other the
doctors could do nothing for me, and as for
the other medicines I believe I might have
poured them into the gutter for all the good
they did me. I can say with truth that
Clements Tonic
Is the Only Remedy
I ever tried that exercised any good
influence on my liver, and its effect was
quite a revelation to me, as I had no idea
that the world contained a remedy that
eould conquer a long standing ailment
As Clements Tonic had
Conquered Mine.”
“ What put it into your head to take it,
Mr. Blanchard ?”
“ I had often read in the newspapers con-
cerning cures effected by Clements Tonic,
but it was only on the positive assurance of
a friend that it would do me good that I
tried it. One of my bad bilious fits was on,
and I.bought a bottle.”
“ And the result was ?
“It was as excellent as unexpected. I
found it gave me immediate relief. After a
few doses my
Biliousness Went Away,
my headache disappeared, and that dull,
heavy feeling was gone. I can positively
say that before I had finished the bottle I
was completely cured and had a better
appetite than I had had f or years. Ino
longer felt heavy and unrefreshed, as I
used to when I got up in the morning, but felt
Bright and Vigorous
and ready to undertake any amount of work
if called upon to do it. The most satisfac-
tory part of the business is that I’ve never
had any biliousness since, not so much as a
touch of it, and my food digests perfectly.
I’m sure my liver works
All Right Now,
for I never feel it at all.”
“ And you attribute this quick and com-
plete cure entirely to Clements Tonic ?”
“ I do, most positively. I took nothing
else, and I am only too pleased to bear
witness to the speed and
Permanence of Its Cure.

How Steelman told His Story.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was Steelman’s humor, in some of his moods,
to take Smith into his confidence, as some old
bushman do their dogs. “ You’re nearly as good
as an intelligent sheep-dog to talk to, Smith
when a man gets tired of thinking to himself and
wants a relief. You’re a bit of a mug and a good
deal of an idiot, and the chances are that you
don’t know what I’m driving at half the time —
that’s the main reason why I don’t mind talking
to you. You ought to consider yourself honored ;
it ain’t every man I take into my confidence, even
that far.”
Smith rubbed his head.
“ I’d sooner talk to you—or a stump—any day
than one of those silent, suspicious, self-contained,
worldly-wise chaps that listen to everything you
say—sense and rubbish alike— as if you were trying
to get them to take shares in a mine. I drop the
man who listens to me all the time and doesn’t
seem to get bored. He isn’t safe. He isn’t to be
trusted. He mostly wants to grind his axe against
yours, and there’s too little profit for me where
there are two axes to grind, and no stone —though
I’d manage it once, anyhow.”
“ How’d you do it ? ” asked Smith.
“There are several ways. Either you join
forces, for instance, and find a grindstone—or
make one of the other man’s axe. But the last
way is too slow, and, as I said, takes too much
brain-work—besides, it doesn’t pay. It might
satisfy your vanity or pride, but I’ve got none. I
had once, when I was younger, but it—well, it
nearly killed me, so I dropped it.”
“ You can mostly trust the man who wants to
talk more than you do—he’ll make a safe mate —
or a good grindstone ! ”
Smith scratched the nape of his neck and sat
blinking at the fire, w-it-h the puzzled expression
of a woman who might be pondering a life-
question or the trimming of a hat. Steelman
took his chin in his hand and watched Smith
thoughtfully.
_ “ I —l say, Steely,” exclaimed Smith, suddenly,
sitting up and scratching his head and blinking
harder than ever—“ wha—what am I ? ”
“ How do you mean ? ”
“ Am I the axe or the grindstone ? ”
“Oh ! your brain seems in extra good working-
order to-night, Smith. Well, you turn the grind-
stone and I grind.” [Smith settled.] “If you
could grind better than I, I’d turn the stone and
let you grind. I’d never go against the interests
of the firm—that’s fair enough, isn’t it ? ”
“ Ye-es,” admitted Smith ; “ I suppose so.”
“So do I. Now, Smith, we’ve got along all
right together for years, off and on, but you never
know what might happen. I might stop breath-
ing, for instance—and so might you.”
Smith began to look alarmed.
“Poetical justice might overtake one or both of
us—such things have happened before, though
not often. Or, say, misfortune or death might
mistake us for honest, hard-working mugs with
big families to keep, and cut us off in the
bloom of all our wisdom. You might get into
trouble, and, in that case, I’d be bound to leave
you there, on principle ;* or I might get into
trouble, and you wouldn't have the Drains to get
mo out—though I know you’d be mug enough to
try. I might make a rise and out you, or you
might be misled into showing some spirit, and
clear out after I’d stonshed you for it. You
might get tired of me calling you a mug, and bos-
sing you and making a tool or convenience of you,
you know. You might go in for honest graft (you
were always a bit weak-minded) and then 1 d have
to wash my hands of you (unless you agreed to
keep me) for an irreclaimable mug. Or it might
suit me to become a respected and worthy fellow
townsman, and then, if you came within ten
miles of me or hinted that you ever knew me, I’d
have you up for vagrancy, or soliciting alms, or
attempting to levy blackmail. I’d have to fix you—
so I give you fair warning. Or we might get into
some desperate fix (and it needn’t be very desper-
ate, either) when I’d be obliged to sacrifice you for
my own personal safety, comfort and convenience.
Hundreds of things might happen.
“ Well, as I said, we’ve been at large together
for some years, and I’ve found you sober, trust-
worthy and honest; so, in case we do part—as we
will sooner or later —and you survive, I’ll give you
some advice from my own experience.
“In the first place: If you ever happen to get
born again—and it wouldn’t do you much harm —
get born with the strength of a bullock and the
hide of one as well, and a swelled head, and no
brains—at least no more brains than you’ve got
now. I was born with a skin like tissue-paper,
and brains ; also a heart.
“ Get born without relatives, if you can; if you
can’t help it, clear out on your own just as soon
after you’re born as you possibly can. I hung on.
“ If you have relations, and feel inclined to help
them any time when you’re flush (and there’s no
telling what a weak-minded man like you might
take it into his head to do) —don’t do it. They’ll
get a down on you if you do. It only causes
family troubles and bitterness. There’s no dis-
like like that of a dependant. You’ll get neither
gratitude nor civility in the end, and be lucky if
you escape with a character. [You’ve got no
character, Smith ; I’m only just supposing you
have.] There’s no hatred too bitter for, and
nothing too bad to be said of, the mug who turns.
The worst yarns about a man are generally started
by his own tribe, and the world believes them at
once on that very account. Well, the first thing
to do in life is to escape from your friends.
“If you ever go to work—and miracles have
happened before—no matter what your wages are,
or how you are treated, you can take it for
granted that you’re sweated ; act on that to the
best of your ability, or you’ll never rise in the
world. If you go to see a show on the nod you’ll
be found a comfortable seat in a good place ; but
if you pay the chances are the ticket clerk will tell
you a lie, and you’ll have to hustle for standing-
room. The man that doesn’t ante gets the best
of this world ; anything he’ll stand is good enough
for the man that pays. If you try to be too sharp
you’ll get into gaol sooner or later ; if you try to
be too honest the chances are that the bailiff will
get into your house —if you have one—and make
a holy show of you before the neighbors. The
honest softy is more often mistaken for a swindler,
and accused of being one, than the out-and-out
scamp ; and the man that tells the truth too much
is set down as an irreclaimable liar. But most of
the time crow low and roost high, for it’s a funny
world, and you never know what might happen.
“ And if you get married (and there’s no
accounting for a woman’s taste) be as bad as you
like, and then moderately good, and your wife will
love you. If you’re bad all the time she can’t
stand it for ever, and if you’re good all the time
she’ll naturally treat you with contempt. Never
explain what you're going to do, and don’t explain
afterwards, if you can help it. If you find your-
self between two stools, strike hard for your own
self, Smith —strike hard, and you'll be respected
more than if you fought for all the world. Gene-
rosity isn’t understood nowadays, and what the
people don’t understand is either ‘mad’ or
‘ cronk.’ Failure has no case, and you can’t build
one for it. ... I started out in life very young—
and very soft.”
“I thought you were going to tell me your
story, Steely,” remarked Smith.
Steelman smiled sadly.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To the numerous Tyson yarns let me add
the following, as an eye-witness of the incident.
On the previous evening, at the Royal Hotel in
Toowoomba, Tyson had declared to a smoking-
room full of bold, bad men that he had never
kissed a woman, nor allowed a woman to kiss him.
This was overheard by a well-known and eccentric
Warwick lady of robust physique and determined
character, and next day, on Toowoomba station
platform, she walked up to Tyson, threw her
arms round him, gave him a sounding smack on
the lips, stepped back and exclaimed—“ There,
Mr. Tyson, you can never say‘again that no lady
ever kissed you ! ” Tyson first “grew red as any
rose —syne pale as any lily,” and then he
called for a policeman to arrest the woman for
“ this outrage ! ” The Warwick amazon after-
wards declared that if she had been given in
charge, the next time she met Tyson she “would
have ” [held over for further consideration.]
• * * •
In 1877, when genial George Thorn was
Queensland Premier, I was training it with him to
Toowoomba. Having an engine-pass, I rode on
the cowcatcher, and .shot about a dozen wallabies
when crossing the Little Liverpool Range. Tyson
was on the train, and, inquiring of Thorn who the
sportsman was, was introduced to me at Helidon,
and joined me on the cowcatcher. Found him
most interesting to talk to. His store of facts
was astonishing, and very little in bush lore had
escaped him. Found even that he was acquainted
with the fact that the musk-duck, though ordi-
narily unable to fly, in cases of necessity starves
itself until i'ts feeble wings will carry it miles to
the nearest water. A musk-duck that, in condi-
tion, weighs 61b. or so, will starve itself down to
21b., try its powers of flight on its vanishing
lagoon, and then start on its journey. I believe
this is the first mention of the fact in print. Tyson
was also the first white man I ever heard refer to
the existence of an aristocracy amongst the Aus-
tralian aboriginals.
* * * •
A lady in a far-west Queensland township
recently published a pamphlet entitled “ A Holy
War, the True Reign of the Millennium.” On first
page she says : “ I am the very one who took the
little book out of Satan's hand. The morning
after I was called Satan came down noon me face
to face. He put out his tongue at me like a snake.
His face was like a man’s, but his eyes were
larger. This was on 22nd May, 1870. I fasted
three days, and prayed often. This is true, be-
ll^ 6 God and man ” ! A western shearer who had
this read to him promptly exclaimed, “Oh, I
know the bloomin’ cove she’s talking about. It’s
-Bngalow Jack! ”
* • * *
Conversing recently at Rockhampton with
the best authority on the subject, he recalled the
. kl6*kn ov yn fact that Gold Commissioner Griffin
in 1807 (while on gold-escort duty) poisoned Con-
stables Power and Cahill before he shot them.
Gave them the poison in some liquor before he
left camp to go to the hotel about half-a-mile
away, doubtless expecting them to be dead when
he went down during the night to collar
the cash. Power had been sick and retching, but
he had strength enough to fire at Griffin, the
bullet passing through the Commissioner’s beard.
After shooting Power with two bullets, Griffin
nred one through Cahill, who was then either dead
or dying from the effects of the poison. The two
stomachs were sent for analysis, but as they were
never referred to in the evidence the chances are
there was either no examination or no result.
Griffin had a sense of honor. To pay his gambling
debts he first appropriated £4OO trust-money, and
then to make this good he murdered two of his
own troopers in cold blood ! Had been decorated
for service in the Crimea, too !

The death of Hori Grey recalled an opinion
I heard expressed by MTlwraith after the two
knights met at the famous Conference. MTl-
wraith—then in good health and full of energy
and decision—regarded Grey as “a most con-
temptible man a mere egotistical political
theatricality, with no fixed opinions on any sub-
ject. ” Can any Bulletin reader tell us something
about Grey’s opinion of MTlwraith ?

I have seen the female who fooled the
police with a fairy tale of how two strange men
called on her the morning after the Gatton murder,
and how she went out at 7 o’clock a.m. (before
M‘Neill found the bodies) and arranged the dead
girls’ dresses ! ! She is an aesthetic creature, who
would look well with a lily in one hand and 141 b.
of boiled pork in the other; weighs some 2001 b.,
and looks about as intelligent as a mopoke in the
daytime. For of such is the kingdom of wit-
nesses in the day of sensational crimes.

Go into the mills and
workshops of the city—
look at the sturdy speci-
mens of manhood that for
years have been the pride
and boast of Sydney—bulg-
ing muscles, swelling chests,
massive shoulders.
Surely such men as these
could never know an ache or
pain. But they do.
The heavy lifting, long
hours, constant standing on
the feet, put a strain on the
kidneys that these delicate
little organs can’t bear.
The poisons that ought
to be taken out of the blood
are foroed back into the
system. Backache comes.
Every little cold settles
in the kidneys.
There’s a constant tired
feeling.
But there is one thing
will stop it—
Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills.
They are curing sick
kidneys here in Sydney
every day, making men
stronger and happier and
healthier.
Head what James Dunn, of 28-g- Balfour-street (off George-
street), says regarding this medicine :
“My employment frequently compels me to work in damp clothes. I am an in-
spector at Hoskins’ Iron Works, Wattle-street, this city. From this fact is no doubt
traceable my kidney complaint, as I would frequently feel chilly sensations, and I presume
slight colds settled in my kidneys. However that may be, I began to have much trouble
with my back, and it has been annoying me for four or five months. Liniments had no
effect on me, and my back continued to ache until recently. I have obtained relief by
taking Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, which I obtained at Newman’s Pharmacy, King-street.
They seem to have completely cured me, for I now have no back pains, and I am able to
attend to my work without the slightest inconvenience. I have already recommended this
medicine to many sufferers, and know it has great curative powers.’’

Bells and Trumpets.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We thought that love might amaranthine be—
Ah ! quickly born ; ah ! swiftly dead —
And found it like a meteor flash o’er scarp and sea,
All glorious for a space, and sped;
All changeless for a year, and then a change
(Dust trying to be true),
The loved indifferent, the familiar strange,
And that repels which drew.
Over the plain and over the fell,
Over dyii g leaves, over bronzing grasses,
“ Tomb ” says the bell, ringing the knell
Of desire that hath blazed and changes and
passes.
Trumpet and bell, clarion and knell,
Bridal and tomb, arc-light and gloom,
Frond and the fruit, sad shawm, light lute,
-JT he contrasts of night and the dawning—
“Ht is our fate, early or late.
Die old loves, come bold loves, old memories
scorning ;
Feet of the dust
Have the gods we did trust,
tut new gods we’ll find in the morning.
Old loves we have left in their bleak, bitter old-
world,
A nd here in a South one
Love builds a new nest in a rose-hued and gold
world,
That is fresh from a drouth won.
Oh, cream cheek, half-flushed, like a roseate dusk!
Oh, lips of geranium ! Oh, scent of young musk !
Oh, figure of fairy !
Oh, breath of rosemary—
Kosemary and wine,
And all of these —mine !
The orange blossom swoons amid its scent,
The tuberose perfumed hands abroad is flinging;
All love’s unrest, and fire, and discontent
Are vocal in my blood with shouts and singing.
Love militant throws wide the gate 3 of blossom,
Love's wing-touch crowneth us as queen and
king;
• ound a blood-leaping note for each young bosom,
Ye trumpets of the Spring !
Trumpet and bell, dulcimer, lute,
f 'boe and horn, treble of flute,
Fierce cornet flare, brazening blare,
Clarion of empery, kingdom, and baron!
Organ and harp,
Minor and sharp,
Sing the new conquest! Flaunt your gay gonfalon l
The trumpets of Spring
Have found a new king,
nd meet him and greet him with flame and with
fanfaron !'

Concerning Lynda Grey.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The new-ehum said that women could be divided
into three classes—viz., good, bad and indifferent,
and any fellow with a little experience could read
them one and all like a book.
The storekeeper, who was grey-headed and had
lived a varied life, smiled indulgently and said
that sonny would change his opinions by the time
his moustache grew ; for his part, he considered
that women could be judged by no known law*
human or divine—that they were mysteries, even
to themselves ; and, to prove his case, he told us
the story of Lynda Grey.
She was one of those egg-shell-china-looking
women with childish blue eyes and very red lips.
Her thick fair hair was always straight off her
forehead —perhaps it was that which made her
look so saintly—and before Jim Grey came along
with his good looks and good income to make love
to her in his impetuous, passionate way, she had
had a hard life as an underpaid lady-help in the
household of an ambitious selector. It wasn’t
long before they were married, and she came as
mistress to Gundara, as fine a freehold as one
could find on the M’lntyre. I was bookkeeper
there, as I am here, and found things just as much
more comfortable in some ways for the presence of
a mistress, as Jim did altogether.
Jim was just over-head-and-ears in love and
jealous of every fellow who came near the place, if
he was at all good-looking. That is perhaps why
he didn’t mind Phil Margate being about the
bouse all day, for Phil was a very plain chap—if
you excepted his eyes. We picked him up with a
broken leg at the very gates, where his trap and
horses had achieved a complete smash-up—and of
course we had to fetch him in and doctor him.
After a time Jim quite liked having him there.
Jim had been born and bred on Gundara, whereas
Margate had travelled all over the world, and as he
got better he would entertain us for hours together
as we all sat on the verandah at night. Even
placid Mrs. Grey, who seemed to have as few
strong feelings about anything as the doll she
looked like, would sit longer than usual when
Margate was in the vein for telling travellers’
tales.
At last Margate’s leg got well enough to enable
him to leave. The evening before he was to go I
was out with the boss taking a look at the shed,
which was a good two miles from the station.
Those were woolshed-burning times —though
Gundara was in a quiet district. However, on
the way we met the overseer going out, and he
carried the boss’s orders himself; so we turned
back and took a short cut across the paddocks
which would land us behind the house instead of
at the front. We had to pass through a small
patch of myall scrub which stretched almost up
to the garden. I was on ahead and came into a
little pocket of the scrub first, and there caught a
glimpse of the most passionate love-scene I have
ever had the luck to drop across. The moonlight
shone for a moment on Lynda Grey’s face—not an
expressionless, doll-face any longer; the man was
Margate, of course. The missus had been kind
to me one way and another, and I owed her a
good turn. I knew Grey’s madly-jealous nature
too well, and I turned and shouted out something
to him about the key of the little horse-paddock
gate. He was very close to me, and from some-
thing in his face I felt sure his suspicions were
aroused, though he had not seen as plainly as I
had.
“ Was anyone there?” he said abruptly, point-
ing across the pocket—which, of course, was
empty enough now.
“No one,” I said briefly—“though the moon-
light plays tricks in these trees. lam afraid I
dropped the key of the gate about a hundred yards
back. I remember thinking something fell when
I took out iny tobacco-pouch, but I thought it was
an empty match-box at the time.
He grumbled savagely at the delay, and I can
tell you I was some time finding that key, but I
calculated long enough for the couple to get a good
start back to the house.
Then we cantered through the clearing to-
wards the gate, and I noticed how the ground was
thick with those strong-scented wild white petu-
nias—it was like riding through a Parramatta
orange-grove as our horses trod on the flowers.
Well, when we got to the house there was
Lynda Grey sitting as usual in her verandah-chair
looking as calm and collected as you please.
“ Why, you are home early,’’ she said—“ is the
shed all right ? ”
“ Quite right. We met Brown going out. I
wonder you have not been for a stroll —it’s such a
lovely night, Lynda,” said Grey.
“ I did think of it,” she said ; “ but it is very hot,
and I thought I would go later to meet you.’’
“ Where is Margate ? ” said Grey, abruptly. He
wasn’t a born actor, if she was.
“ Oh, he went to his room to pack soon after ten
—he is going early in the morning. If lam not
up, Jim, you must say good-bye forme. Come in
now and have some supper.”
Jim sat down to take off his spurs, and I went
on with Mrs. Grey into the dining-room. As we
went, she took a white petunia out of the front of
her dress and put it in her pocket.
Well, Margate left next morning for Sydney,
and Mrs. Grey was too lazy to get up and see him
off, and things went along as {>eaeefiilly as ever,
only that Grey was not so happy. Suspicion dies
hard in a nature like his. Then one mail morning
we opened the papers in the office, and read an
account of Phil Margate’s death in a big railway-
accident down South. He had been amongst
those scalded to death, and the news upset me not
a little, for it was but a few months since he had
been with us.
Grey folded the paper—he was thinking out
something—and we went over to breakfast to-
gether.
Lynda, in a white wrapper and blue ribbons,
was making the tea, and there was no way at all
for me to give her warning. I knew just what
was coming when Jim unfolded the paper and
re:\ .1 her the paragraph about the accident. I
thought I saw a scornful gleam in her eyes for
just one second as she raised them and found us
both watching her intently.
The rose-leaf flush paled a little in her cheeks,
as was only natural, but her hands were steady as
she measured out the milk. “ How very shock-
ing,” she said. “Poor man! They are so care-
less on that line sometimes. Very shocking in-
deed ! ”
And chat was how she took the news. I felt
relieved, and yet surprised, for, from the look I
had seen on the woman’s face that moonlight
night, one might easily have thought she had a
heart. Now I was sure she had not. As for the
boss, he ought to have been satisfied at last, and I
think he was.
The months went on, and it was early summer
again. We had a jackaroo on Gundara now—a
Scotch lad—and one evening I was riding home
with him, through the paddock at the back of the
house. The pocket in the scrub was white with
the flowers, as it had been the year before, and
the Highlander must needs get off and gather a
bunch of them. When we got to the house, the
boss and the missus were sitting, as usual, on the
verandah ; and, while I stopped to tell him what
was doing on the run, the Scotch lad bundled his
posy, which was as big as a house, into Mrs.
Grey’s lap, saying, “ I’ve brought ye the wee hit
flowers, Mrs. Grey. They’re rare sweet and fine.”
Well, she picked them up and buried her face
in them, and then burst in a passion of tears, and
cried and cried as if her heart would break.
Poor Scotchy stood as if he had been caught in
committing murder—until I dragged him away,
leaving Jim Grey to fit together the pieces of the
puzzle if he could. What happened afterwards
(though you can guess she was a bit too clever not
to be able to patch things up somehow) hasn’t
anything to do with the story, which is only to
prove that women can’t be judged by any rule.
Here was one who could make tea calmly while
she heard of her lover’s death—the cruellest death
a man can die—and say, without a change in her
voice, “ How shocking ! ” —and yet could not con-
trol her feelings, and risked everything she counted
good in life, because someone gave her a few wild-
flowers that reminded her of bygone kisses. What
do you think of that, Chummie?
“Oh ! she was the exception that proves the
rule,” said Chummie.

■jea-
“ I wish to say to every one that I have used a great deal of Ayer’#
Sarsaparilla in my family. I believe it is the best family medicine there i#
in the world.
“Once, while I was on a vessel trading to the Bast Indies and also while I
was living in Calcutta, I used Ayer’s Sarsaparilla for impurities in my blood,
and with the best results. I always took a stock of it with me when I went on
my voyages. I could not feel safe without it. Bor eruptions of the skin, boils,
and such affections it is a quick and sure cure. I re’commend it to everybody
suffering from impurities in the blood, showing itself in any way whatsoever.”
This is what Mr. W. A. Bind say (whose portrait, with that of his wife and
child, is here given), of Stanthorpe, Queensland, Australia, thinks of Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla. Because of the multitude of such cases, the people call Ayer’S
Sarsaparilla
«(
The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
Because some other preparation may be ,called a sarsaparilla is not the
slightest reason that it is anything like “Ayer’s” Sarsaparilla. If you wish
these quick results, these safe results, these sure results, you must insist upott
jetting “Ayer’s.” Make a particular point of this.
