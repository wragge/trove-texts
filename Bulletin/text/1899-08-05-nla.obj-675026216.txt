A. Man who Fought for Humanity.
I.
EOBERT GREEN INGERSOLL was
born at Dresden, a township in
the state of New York, U.S.A., on
11th August, 1833. He died, it appears, in
New York eity, on 22nd July, 1899, in the
66th year of his age. As an orator, he
was one of the most notable of the century ;
as a man, he was among the greatest that
America has given to the world.
Ingersoll's father was a Congregational
minister, bigger-brained than many minis-
ters, yet strict in the observance of doctrine,
and held within narrow bounds by his
church adherents. “ Every church mem-
ber,” wrote Ingersoll, “ with a creed, like
a club, in his hand, stands guard over the
brain of the minister.”
Of his mother, Ingersoll could never speak
without emotion. She was a woman of
passionate sympathies, and her son believed
that he owed her all his best.
After school-days, Ingersoll studied law
and practised in the lesser country towns
gradually gaining reputation. When the
Civil War came he threw up everything to
follow the army ; served through the whole
campaign ; and became a colonel of cavalry
At the close of the war he re-took his pro
fession, and threw himself into politics as an
ardent Republican. He was made At
torney-General of Illinois in 1866, anc
gradually acquired national fame as a law
yer and orator. His anti-Christian addresses
were the most effective ever delivered: at the
opposition and obloquy they gained him he
laughed serenely, and his life turned enemies
into friends. He never descended to per-
sonalities. “I oppose Catholicism,” he said,
* ‘ not Catholics ; Presbyterianism, not Pres-
byterians ; Christianity, not Christians.
When I see a man with rheumatism or
religion I pity the man, and hate the rheu-
matism or religion.”
In middle life Ingersoll returned to New
York, where for many years has been his
home. As a lawyer he was employed in
special cases as consultant or pleader, anc
reached the topmost rank of his profession.
He made money fast, and spent it liberally—
according to his creed.
It is as an opponent of religion that
Ingersoll is best known ; but his opposition
to religion was only one phase in a full and
harmonious life. Before all things Ingersoll
was human—and humane. He preached
the Gospel of Love. His charities were
boundless. The purity of his private
life silenced slanderers. The happiness of
his private life was such as falls to the lot of
few.
He surrounded himself with beauty—
according to his creed ; opening his brain to
books, music, art, friends—all the best that
life could give him. He made a visit to
Europe, but the offer of high diplomatic
preferment could not persuade him to go
there permanently. “I am unhappy away
from my country,” he confessed, and
When I have been in other countries I have saic
to myself, “After all, my country is the best ! ’
And when I came back and saw the old flag
flying, it seemed as though the air, from pure joy,
had burst into blossom.
Ingersoll died, as he had often expressed
a wish to die, before the decay of age had,
mastered him. He was, indeed, so spend-
thrift of his energies, he embraced Life so
fully, that the serene old age which he ad-
mired could not be his. In recent years it
was plain that his constitution was breaking
up, and he narrowed the sphere of his
external life, reserving himself to his home.
Personally Ingersoll was of the middle
height and broad, with a strong neck sup-
porting a grand head, showing a perfect oval
of face and brow. In his prime he looked
splendidly vital, the embodiment of physical
and mental force. Few such men are born,
and the country which bears them may well
be proud. They are foremost soldiers in the
liberation-war of humanity.
11.
After hearing Ingersoll speak, it was easy
to believe enthusiasts who called him the
greatest orator that ever lived. If the
essence of oratory resides in power of
statement and persuasion, in dominating
and convincing an audience, in flooding the
dullest facts with poetry, lifting the meanest
statement by the aid of illustration and
argument to the semblance of eternal truth,
and in doing these things sincerely, referring
everything to the highest standards of
honour, of integrity, of patriotism, that the
orator knows, then Ingersoll was as great an
orator as ever lived. He was irresistible,
and no man could be more. His hearers
hung on his words : they were always simple
and intelligible, even when Ingersoll rhe-
torically decorated them with the imagery of
which lie was such a master. And when he
rose, as lie could rise, to the height of a lofty
theme, he ma'de a permanent addition to the
stored riches of eloquence. His speech at
the Soldiers’ Re-union at Indianopolis in
1876, when he reviewed—as was his favorite-
method —a series of incidents in the past,
transmuting old memories into the keenest
emotion, is one of the intellectual treasures
of America. “The past,” he said,
The past rises before me like a dream. Again
we are in the great struggle fur national life. We
hear the sounds of preparation—the music of
boisterous drums the silver voices of heroic
bugles. We see thousands of assemblages, and
hear the appeals of orators. We see the pale
cheeks of women, arid the flushed faces of men ;
and in those assemblages we see all the dead whose
dust we have covered with flowers. We. lose,sight
of them no more. We are with them when they
enlist in the great army of freedom. W e see
them part with those they love. ... We see the
wife standing in the door with the babe in her
arms, standing in the sunlight sobbing. At the
turn of the road a hand waves—-she answers by
holding high in her loving arms the child. He is
gone, and forever.
We see. them all as they march proudly away
under the flaunting flags, keeping time to the
grand, wild music of war —marching down the
streets of the great cities—through the towns and
across the prairies—down to the fields of glory, to
do and to die for the eternal right. . . .
We are at home when the news comes that they
are dead. We see the maiden in the shadow of
her first sorrow. We see the silvered heads of old
men bowed with the last grief.
These heroes are dead. They died for liberty—
they died for us. They sleep in the land they
made free, under the flag they rendered stain-
less.
In cold print the utterance is too ornate,
too elaborate. Ingersoll’s love of rhetoric
was not guided by the best taste. He spoils
the climax in the last paragraph by adding
“ under the solemn pines, the sad hemlocks,
the tearful willows, and the embracing
vines.” There is for readers a too liberal,
too intentional selection from the arboreal
catalogue. But delivered in a voice of flutes
and trumpets, backed by the o,.dor's im-
pressive personality, his magnetic gesture,
his thrilling eye—and to an audience which
matched every sentence with memories, the
magnificence of the speech was flawless.
And even in cold print there are few pic-
tures so touching as that most intimate and
pathetic picture of the man who goes
to fight for his country, and the wife—
The wife standing in the door with the babe in
her arms, standing in the sunlight sobbing. At
the turn of the road a hand waves—she answers
by holding in her loving arms the child. He is
gone, and forever.
111.
It is easy to understand that advocates of
the current theologies writhed under Inger-
soll’s tongue. As an iconoclast he united
the force of Bradlaugh to the wit of Vol-
taire ; and withal he was so true, so manly,
that his bitterest opponents could not help
admiring him. Beside Ingersoll, Talmage
was only a windy mountebank ; even
Beecher, with all his fine emotion, seemed
sometimes shallow compared with him.
For Ingersoll buttressed his rhetoric with
reason ; his wit and sense make his
speeches first - class literature : the ordi-
nary orator’s, like Gladstone’s, are vapid
and tame when reduced to print. He sapped
the citadel of dogma with laughter, yet
exploded its fortifications with shrewd logic
which could never be forgotten. He did
not fear to be “ undignified ” ; he had no
reverence for the rules of dullards; he
spoke as he felt, and used ridicule and
sarcasm to make a way for his arguments.
He fought to win. Conceive the effect of
this upon a popular audience—
The children of Israel in the wilderness lived
on manna. There was not a change in the bill of
fare for forty years, and they knew that God
could just as well give them three square meals a
day. They remembered about the cucumbers,
and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions of
Egypt, and they said:. “Our soul abhorreth this
light bread.” Then this God got mad—you know
cooks are always touchy—and thereupon He sent
snakes to bite the men, women and children. He
also sent them quails in wrath and anger, and
while they had the flesh between their teeth He
struck thousands of them dead. He always acted
that way, all of a sudden. People had no chance
to explain—no chance to move for a new trial—
nothing. I want to know if it is reasonable He
should kill people for asking for one change of
diet in forty years. Suppose you had been board-
ing with an old lady for forty years, and she never
had a solitary thing on the table but hash, and
one morning you said : “My soul abhorreth hash.”
What would you say if she let a basketful of
rattlesnakes upon you ? Now is it possible for
people to believe this ? The Bible says that their
clothes did not wax old, they did not get shiny at
the knees or elbows ; and their shoes did not wear
out. They grew right along with them. The
little boy starting out with his first pants grew up
and his pants grew with him. Some commenta-
tors have insisted that angels attended to their
wardrobes. I never could believe it. Just think
of one angel hunting another and saying : “There
goes another button. ” I cannot believe it.
And Ingersoll's epigrams flew like bullets to
their mark—
. A creed is the ignorant past bullying the en-
lightened present.
The parasite of woman is the priest.
The first doubt was the womb and cradle of
progress.
E very church member bears the marks of collar,
chains and whip.
The church has been a charitable highwayman,
a profligate beggar, a generous pirate.
If I rob Mr. Smith, and God forgives me, how
does that help Smith ?
I am in favor of the taxation of all church pro-
perty. If that property belongs to God, he is able
to pay the tax. If we exempt anything, let us
exempt the homes of the widow and the orphan.
IV.
As a thinker, Ingersoll had little origin-
ality, and even little scope. But he had a
tight grip on the handful of things he knew ;
and as a commentator and expounder he has
never been surpassed. His mind turned
everything it touched to gold ; as soon as he
looked at it, the most barren statement put
forth buds and blossoms of imagination.
Though no poet in the ordinary sense, Inger-
soll had a fine poetic faculty, especially on
the side of form. His matter was often essen-
tially commonplace ; but he so decked it
with imagery that it became transfigured.
He was a master of rhetoric—not, indeed,
in the highest ■ sense, but for the popular
uses of an orator. When he spealks of Napo-
leon in Russia, he says that “the infantry of
the snow and the cavalry of the wild blast
scattered his legions.” Of the country
autumn he said that
The withered banners of the corn are still, and
gathered fields are growing strangely wan, while
death, poeticdeath with hands thateolourwhatthey
touch, weaves in the autumn wood its tapestries of
brown and gold.
The expression is highly poetic, though the
idea is ordinary. In this passage, too, is
seen the strong rhythm which runs through
much of Ingersoll’s prose —not always im-
proving it. His style alternated from
rhythmic to colloquial, and from colloquial to
epigrammatic. Wherever he could he used
an antithesis ; wherever he could he
sharpened the antithesis to an epigram.
It never can be necessary to throw away your
reason to save your soul.
No inan with any sense of humour ever founded
a religion.
A first cause is just as impossible as a last effect.
‘‘ Blasphemy ” is what a last year’s leaf says to
this year’s bud.
The spirit of worship is the spirit of tyranny.
The intellect has no knees.
Every creed is a rock in running water.
Humanity sweeps by it.
Faith is a lullaby sung to put the soul to sleep.
Few men have been patriotic enough to shoulder
a musket in defence of a boarding-house.
The throne and altar are twins, vultures from
the same egg.
Hundreds of such sayings are scattered
through Ingersoll’s writings—the most in-
cisive writings of America. But theological
odium has been potent to suppress his fame :
it is not respectable to refer to him in the
magazines, and the average man’s opinions
are moulded by the conventional critics.
V.
The best side of Ingersoll was his
manly side—the side which stood up for
women and children, friends and country,
exalted love,, extolled the religion of
humanity in the lines of Burns—
To make a happy fireside clime
For weans and wife :
That’s the true pathos and sublime
Of human life.
He gave the homeliest advice to his hearers,
always with a gay vein of humour.
When one of your children tells a lie, be honest
with him ; tell him you have told hundreds of
them yourself. Tell him it is not the best way;
you have tried it. Tell him as the man did in
Maine when his boy left home : “John, honesty
is the best policy: I have tried both.” Just be
honest with him. Imagine now, you are about to
whip a child five years of age. What is the child
to do ? Suppose a man, as much larger than you
as you are larger than a child five years old, should
come at you with a liberty-pole in his hand, and
in a voice of thunder shout: “Who broke that
plate ? ” There s not a solitary one of you who
wouldn’t swear you never saw' it, or that it was
cracked when you found it. When your child
commits a wrong take it in your arms, let it feel
your heart beat against its heart, let the child
know that you really and truly and sincerely
love it. Yet some Christians, good Christians,
when a child commits a fault, drive it from the
door and say, “Never do yob darken this house
again.” Think of that ! And then these same
people will get down on their knees and ask God
to take care of the child they have driven from
home. I will never ask God to take care of my
children unless I am doing my level best in that
same direction. But I will tell you what I say
to my children : “Go where you will; commit
what crime you may ; fall to what depth of degra-
dation you may ; you can never commit any crime
that will shut my door, my arms, my heart to you;
as long as I live you shall have no more sincere
friend. ” Do you know, I have seen some people
who acted as though they thought when the
Saviour said “Suffer little children to come unto
me, for of such is the kingdom of heav.en, ” that he
had a raw-hide under his mantle and made that
remark to get the children within striking dis-
tance.
Or again—
Give the children a chance. Don’t try to teach
them something they can never learn. Don’t
make that poor girl play ten years on a piano
when she has no ear for music, and when she has
practised until she can play ‘ ‘ Bonaparte Crossing
the Alps,” and you can’t tell after she has played
it whether he ever got across or not.
Or again—
They say woman brought all the trouble into the
world. I don’t care if she did. I would rather
live in a world full of trouble with the woman I
love, than live in a heaven with nobody but men.
The man who has really won the love of one
good woman in the world, I do not care if he dies
in the ditch a beggar, his life has been a success.
How impotent were pulpit revilings to injure
a man who felt and spoke like that ! And
Ingersoll was continually expressing such
sentiments in such phrases. His anti-
religious writings are the lesser part of his
published work. He never wearied of praising
the common man, the labourer, of pointing
out how his lot could be bettered, and yet
how in, many ways his lot was enviable.
YI.
As a writer, Ingersoll is handicapped by
his oratory—the whole of his writings were
first spoken, and the cumulative rhetoric of
the orator is often too extravagant for
literary taste. It is noticeable that Inger-
so , en . repeated himself, putting the same
thought in different forms, or using the
same passage in different speeches ; and it
will be a pity if he has not edited his work
foi a final publication. So far as known,
with the exception of one or two addresses’
he has been content to think of himself as
orator, and leave the perpetuation of his
literary fame to others. Noticeable, too,
is it that all Ingersoll’s vital ideas
were exploited, and usually thrown into
their best form, before he was fifty.
For the last twenty years he has been
brilliantly repeating himself. When his
fund of youthful impressions and reflections
was exhausted, he found few others of value.
All that he could do was to add grace or force
to the expression of his garnerings in the
past. Yet, with every drawback made, In-
gersoll is a very considerable literary figure.
His essay on “ Shakespeare ” is too enthusi-
astic to be critical ; but it is perhaps
the most vital short appreciation of
Shakespeare extant. His “ Defence of Free
Thought is a most moving and strenuous
appeal. Even his political addresses are
memorable, apart from their oratorical value.
For Ingeipjoll was a good patriot; he be-
lieved that America was the greatest country
in the world, and that it could be made
greater ; and there is universal value in his
praise of the sentiment of devotion to the
Flag—that fluttering emblem which is so
little, and means so immeasurably much.
And, in social life, he proved his patriotism
was not merely a sentiment. He was a
practical philosopher, who wrote that
The best form of charity is extravagance : the
prodigality of the rich is the providence of the
poor.
And this is a concentration of Ingersoll’s
teaching—
The place to be happy is here ; the time to be
happy is now ; and the way to be happy is to
make others happy.
“Let us make Heaven on Earth," said
Ingersoll, and it is a final summing-up of
human philosophy. You cannot go beyond
that.
VII.
And so this brilliant, loving, honest man
reaches the end lie had so often pondered.
No words can more fitly shrine his memory
than those which he himself spoke over the
grave of Courtlandt Palmer—his friend less
great in accomplishment, no less noble in
character.
My friends : A thinker of pure thoughts, a
speaker of brave words, a doer of generous deeds,
has reached the silent haven that all the dead
have reached, and where the voyage of every life
must end.
In the monotony of subservience, in the multi-
tude of blind followers, nothing is more inspiring
than a free and independent man one who gives
and asks reasons ; one who demands freedom and
gives what he demands ; one who refuses to be
slave or master. Such a man was he to whom we
pay the tribute of respect and love.
He preserved the realm of mind from the inva-
sion of brute force, and protected the children of
the brain from the Herod of authority.
He investigated for himself the questions, the
problems and the mysteries of life. Majorities
were nothing to him. No error could be old
enough—popular, plausible, or profitable enough
—to bribe his judgment or to keep his conscience
still.
He knew that, next to finding truth, the
greatest joy is honest search.
He was a believer in intellectual hospitality, in
the fair exchange of thought, in good mental man-
ners, in the amenities of the soul, in the chivalry
of discussion.
He denied the supernatural—the phantoms and
the ghosts that fill the twilight-land of fear. To
him and for him there was but one religion—the
religion of pure thoughts, of noble words, of self-
denying deeds, of honest work for all the world—
the religion of Help and Hope.
Facts were the foundation of his faith ; history
was his prophet; reason his guide; duty his
deity ; happiness the end ; intelligence the means.
He knew that man must be the providence of
man.
He did not believe in Religion and Science, but
in the Religion of Science —that is to say, wisdom
glorified by love, the Saviour of our race—the
religion that conquers prejudice and hatred, that
drives all superstition from the mind, that
ennobles, lengthens and enriches life, that drives
from every home the wolves of want, from every
heart the fiends of selfishness and fear, and from
every brain the monsters of the night.
He lived and labored for his fellow-men. He
sided with the weak and poor against the strong
and rich. He welcomed light. His face was ever
towards the East.
By the grave of man stands the angel of silence.
No one can tell which is better—Life with its
gleams and shadows, its thrills and pangs, its.
ecstasy and tears, its wreaths and thorns, its
crowns, its glories and Golgothas, or Death with
its peace, its cool and placid brow that hath
within no memory or fear of grief or pain.
Farewell, dear friend. The world is better for
your life —The world is braver for your death.
Farewell ! We loved you living, and we love
you now.

the liver or kidneys, it relieves and cures at once.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
T J. Livingston, whom the Kingston
Govt, secured to move the Address-in-Reply in
S.A. Assembly, has the further distinction of
being the first man to export frozen mutton from
South Australia. He remembers, too, that he
lost money by the transaction. But the province
gained.
The providence that guards
drunken men. Recently, in Elizabeth-st., Sydney,
saw an aged man, who, judging by his appearance,
was smitten with palsy, afflicted with corns
and bunions, twisted with rheumatism, and hard
of hearing, try to cross between two trams, from
opposite directions and another following on. A
friendly conductor, with wonderful presence of
mind, seized him by the collar and pulled him
into the carriage. And did the ancient one fall
down and worship him ? No. He sat in the
doorway of the tram and libelled the conductor’s
mother, and, when the tram stopped, hobbled off
to report him. And the conductor smiled plea-
santly through it all.
Home.
The blue Pacific waves ran clear
In ridges to my feet,
And from their range, and from the gums
Gushed odours keen and sweet.
Squat in the sheoak’s golden flame,
The billy boiled too soon,
Por all was golden drowsiness
That golden afternoon.
I fell asleep and saw myself
Within an ancient room
Of English grange, a white-haired man,
Lit by a ruddy gloom ;
And in my heart a whisper went,
A sense of great release,
I knew that I was home again,
With life and death at peace.
The toil was over—God, how strange !
The tears were on my face—
I need not wander for my bread
From homeless place to place ;
B it here a breathing space I had
Unknown to fate, my foe,
Before I went the outland way
That mortal men must go.
I looked around the panelled walls
And saw dim portraits there
Of noble knight and noble dame
And girlhood sweet and fair;
And in old earven cabinets
Were letters., faded, sere,
With folded tresses, long dead flowers,
And mark of falling tear.
Old perfumes stirred before my hand,
Old heart-breaks bled anew ;
The pink was there, the daffodil,
And, for remembrance, rue ;
My spirit touched the unseen dead
Behind the written word.
The heart touched and wept,
- - -And spirit weeping heard :
Grief for unforgotten hours
Beyond recall for aye,
Regret for lonely youth and love
November tears in May :
A note of joy rose in the sound,
Of coming home at last,
My name was soft on waiting lips
Loved in the ancient past.
My spirit with her sense of rest
Behind the brightening veil,
Had pity on my body’s grief,
For her made weak and pale ;
And as the winds grew to their pitch
Grappling like deadly foes,
She gave unto my mortal part
An hour of deep repose.
A.nd by the winter fire I sat,
Remembered faces came,
By love and death made wondrous sweet,
Of purest spirit flame ;
The hour beside the ruin grey,
The kiss by summer night,
So beautiful, so sad, were seen
In delioate clear light.
Children, unborn, but passionate
With mournful loveliness,
Smiled through their tears, and she was there
Who did my long years bless ;
And all my simple pilgrim gold—
Old print with passing gleam
On ivied tower, old summer walks
By haunted mount and stream.
The flame paled on the hollied crest,
And on the mistletoe,
And something whispered in my heart
’Twas time for me to go;
Aside my spirit, seraph-fresh,
Stood looking on the clay
Chastened for service of the soul,
Then turned towards the Day.
I woke ; and to my dreaming eyes
The hour was as before ;
But still I knew my life was changed.
Then and for evermore.
The wistful passion in my breast
Is not for earthly home,
But I must seek a City still
Wherever I may roam.
Tas.

“ If I were asked which single medicine I should

most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say Chlorodyne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.”

“ D.J.” : Was in a Moore-street (Syd
ney) office t’other day, when a sudden increase
in the steady downpour aggravated two gentle-
men. They looked like gentlemen,,.though I pre-
sently decided that they were only coves. They first
contemplated the wall of rain with curses. Then
to the telephone: “ That you, Joe ? Haw—well,
bring my umbrella down at once ; and, Joe, don’t
let it get wet.” Both gents were arrayed in
waterproofs and leggings, and altogether suffi-
ciently protected against the elements to have
gone to the Pole. About twenty minutes later,
Joe, a delicate-looking lad, appeared with the
brolly carefully wrapped in brown paper, and as
far as possible tucked under his coat. He had no
overcoat, and the water bubbled from his cracked
boots and dripped from the sleeves and the edges
of his garments. His aristocratic master ignored
all that, and briefly directed him to go with Mr.
, and bring back the “ gamp ” for the boss
himself. Said the other man: “Be d , I’m all
right; he’s wet through now, and will catch his
death.” Replied the first gent.: “Really, my
deah feller, you amuse me. He don’t feel it.
He’s accustomed to it; it rolls off him like water
off a duck. Haw, haw ! ” The other hesitated,
and then said with a smile: “Oh, well, if that’s the
case, I’ll go.”. He plunged into the deluge, with
the thinly-clad and unprotected Joe running
behind him to fetch back the brolly when done
with. Last I saw of Joseph, he was struggling
over the face of this democratic country with the
water pouring out of his boots and his pockets
and his hat, and his clothes plastered to'him, and
his share of the umbrella-footing was nil.

learn them ?—wasted on every drunken brute you
see. They ought to be kept for one who could
appreciate them—and one only ! ”
She looked up again. “ Who’d appreciate me? ”
He was a man of moods. “/ would ! ” he said
suddenly. “I would”; and he looked into her
eyes.
Next day he married her.
* * * *
In three months she tired of it all. He was so
good and kind—but . He never hinted at the
past—not even when the little tricks that he was
to appreciate, and did, had one by one disap-
peared. Shortly afterwards she disappeared, and
where he found her he left her.
His friends wondered why Follet went to the
bad so quickly. He lost his billet, then his
friends, then his self-respect. In four years he
drifted into a tattered, disreputable, beer-soaked
loafer, and even the memory of that night he
found her had faded. But as he sank, she rose.
She was now in the height of her profession—the
exclusive property of a very rich man.
* * • *
One night she found him, and knew him. Her
carriage knocked him down, and frightened him—
that was all. He was drunk, dirty, ragged and
muddy. But she knew him.
“Jack!” A scream—then she dung to him,
sobbing.
“Jack ! oh, Jack ! ”
A drunken curse, and a blow.
• * • *
Now all the little tricks are his, and his only.
But he, being merely a common drunken brute,
does not appreciate them.

A jury at Georgetown (Q.)took nine hours
to consider before they arrived at a verdict. After
about five hours they asked the Judge to be allowed
to partake of a little refreshment. Judge refused
promptly, and satirised the sluggish jurymen.
Would not allow them to go for a walk (under
police-escort), and so escape for a few minutes the
impure air of the jury-room. What a farce to
coerce men into unanimity in this ridiculous
fashion ! Why not revive the old English fashion
under which a Judge could cart the jury all over
the country until they agreed ? It would be just
about as sensible.

hard on the local mission-system of one-Chow-one-

scandals due to this sort of thing. Where anent
a Celestial bard :
Any white woman’s body, so they’d have us allow,
Is worth ten times as much as the soul of a Chow—
’Tis a doctrine they never can bring to agree
With the tenets of faith that were taught at Judeel
These sanctified damsels who show us the way
To warble our hymns and (apparently,) pray—
They have given their hearts and their souls to the Lord—
So why should their bodies not go “ by the board ?”
On my word as a heathen, I solemnly swear
That if I can “ nially ” my teacheress fair,
The great Joss of my fathers I’ll strictly eschew
And worship whatever she wishes me to I
Thus each “fattee white gel,” with her ravishing charms,
Serenely may rest in her Chinaman’s arms,
Content in the knowledge her yielding has scored
One precious gem more for the crown of the Lord.
In the sight of the Lord a man’s soul is a gem,
Whether be he descended from Japhet or Shem,
Which is why His poor handmaidens do what they can
To rescue the soul of the poor yellow man.
Though the body be fouled, yet the spirit is pure—
And the body must perish, the spirit endure—
Therefore seek not of that which is mortal in ye,
But piump for the soul of the Heathen Chinee !

SATURDAY, AUGUST 5, 1899.
Westralia’s Hesitation.
Westkalra has referred the Federal question to a
select committee of Parliament, with instructions
to doze over it till not later than sth September.
After that it will present the results of its deep
sleep to Parliament, and Parliament will act or
otherwise. There is no attempt on the part of
the old sandgroping element, which still controls
the Legislature though it forms only a small por-
tion of the community, to disguise the fact that
it is against union. It doesn’t like new things ;
it doesn't like to be disturbed ; it loves to lie and
sleep away the long languid days in the middle of
the road and not have to wake up to find the foot-
marks of a hurrying world all over its cuticle.
And it desires to know why anybody
should trouble over anything, and why the
old things that were good enough for its
forefathers are not good enough for it. Also,
it wants to know for certain whether, if
it federates, the Commonwealth Government
will guarantee to build a transcontinental railway
to Perth. It wants to know about some other
things also, but it wants to know about that rail-
way with a very great want indeed.
• * * *
The Federal Constitution offers a good many
things to Westralia, if the Sandgroper would only
consider it apart from his usual narrow prejudice
against the East., It offers him, to begin with,
eight times as much representation in the Federal
Senate as his population fairly entitles him to, and a
fraction more representation in the House of
Representatives than he is fairly entitled to —
which means so many more members to barrack
for the coveted railway. It gives him this if he
comes in now; only Original States are entitled
to equal representation in the Senate. The Bill also
offers another special concession; clause 95 provides
that for five years after the beginning of the
Commonwealth, Westralia shall have the right to
charge duties on the produce of all the other pro-
vinces while they must admit the produce of Wes-
tralia absolutely free. Timber is Westralia’s third
largest export, and this means that the timber
trade of the Eastern provinces, now so largely
monopolised by Maoriland, will be, to a great
extent, handed over to Westralia instead, for
Maoriland timber will be a duty-burdened article
from outside, and W.A. timber will be a duty-
free artiole from inside the Commonwealth. Join-
ing the union now means that Westralia will still
have a chanoe to develope its coal industry for
five years, by shutting out the coal of the other
provinces per medium of a heavy import tax,
while it can sell coal to the adjacent South Aus-
tralian market free of all tax, and thus secure a
valuable export trade. It can keep on protect-
ing its own grain against that of the Itast
for five years, and yet it can export gram to
the East free of duty. And Westralia has to
consider the solemn fact that, in two years from
now, if it progresses as it did last year, it will not
only be able to supply itself with grain, but will
have a surplus for export, and to be guaranteed
the free run of all the markets of the Eastern
States with that surplus, while itself protected
against the competition of the Eastern States in
years when they have a surplus, will give it no
small advantage.
* * * *
And this is only the beginning of the special ad-
vantages which the Eastern States offer to the
pampered West. During the period of five years
in which Westralia is to be protected against the
competition of its neighbors, while they are not
protected against it, Westralia has a chance to
become with a rush one of the great manufacturing
provinces of Australasia. Any person who starts
a new industry or puts up a new factory in
Queensland, N.S.W., Victoria, S. A., or Tasmania
will have the free run of these States as a market
for his goods, but he won’t have the free run of
Westralia. And any one who puts up a new
factory in Perth will have the free run of all the
States as a market for his goods, while for five
years he will be protected against all competition
in his own market. For five years it will pay
better to start a new industry in W.A. than in
any other province, and, by the end of that time,
Westralia’s manufactures and agriculture should
have gained a start which will keep them abreast
of all eastern competition.
* * * *
At present Westralia imports from the other
provinces a very large quantity of goods —spirits,
beer, and tobacco' —which pay excise duty, tinder
the provincial system these duties are part of the
revenue of the provinces where the goods are pro-
duced —the excise on the beer, spirits, &c., which
Westralia imports from Victoria or N.S.W. goes
to swell the public income of Victoria or N.S.W.,
and not a copper of the money reaches the Wes-
tralian Treasury. Under the Commonwealth Bill
(clause 93, section 1) all this excise revenue will,
for at least five years, be paid to Westralia, and
will furnish it with a new and very respectable
source of income so long as it continues a large
importer of exeiseable good from the East. And
by the end of that time Westralia, being protected
for five years against the competition of the other
provinces while the other provinces are left
absolutely open to West Australian competition,
will probably be a beer and spirit exporting
province, and independent of eastern supplies.
« * * *
As regards the coveted transcontinental rail-
way, there are two sides to that question also. The
dominant political party in Westralia at present
inclines to stand out of the union unless it receives
a guarantee that the Federal Government will
build the much-desired line. It proposes, in fact,
to make that line the price of its adhesion to the
Commonwealth. If Westralia comes in now it
gains the advantage of being an Original State—in
other words it will have a far larger number of
members in the Australian Parliament to cry out
day and night about the urgent need for an
across-Australian railway than it is likely
to have if it joins later on. The State
which comes in later on is liable to be admitted
merely on the basis of representation according to
population, which might leave W.A. with one
senator instead of six. If Westralia comes in it is
almost certain to gain the powerful support of
N.S.W. and S.A. for its line—a railway from
Sydney through Broken Hill to the West would
suit N.S.W. admirably, and the connection of
Adelaide with the West would probably suit S.A.
down to the ground also. And, in any case, the
Commonwealth will be forced to construct a
transcontinental line—probably more than one
some day for defence purposes. But if Westralia
stands out, then the defence of W.A. won’t be the
Commonwealth’s funeral, and it will be under no
such obligation. And if Westralia refuses to
come in unless it gets its great railway guaranteed,
a large section in the East will simply reply that
it will be very glad to leave W.A. out. The com-
mercial class in the East is none too well pleased to
have a partner who is allowed for a number of years
to shut out its goods by a border tariff while it can’t
shut out that partner’s goods in return. And the
large States, which view with'a certain jealousy
the preponderance of the small States in the
Senate, won’t grieve any too much if there is one
small State the less.
* * * *
If the West becomes an Original State of che
Commonwealth, it should have a considerable in-
crease of revenue for the first year or two, at all
events; it will still have its customs duties—
foreign and interprovincial—-and it will collect, in
addition, a good deal of excise revenue which now
goes to other provinces. It should have no serious
decrease of revenue for at least five years —till its
interprovincial duties are abolished. Even after
that the loss of revenue is estimated by its own
authorities at some <£300,000 per annum—not
much more than it lost last year without Federa-
tion. This would leave it with a very much larger
revenue per head than any other province.
And there is no guarantee that it won’t lose
a much larger proportion of its customs
revenue if it doesn’t federate. The new majo-
rity is beginning to kick furiously against
Westralia’s revenue tariff; and while the
Federal majority (if Westralia federates) may
build an Australian tariff that will reduce W. A.’s
customs revenue by £300,000 a year, there is no
possible guarantee that the local majority (if Wes-
tralia doesn’t federate, and when the goldfields
can no longer be deprived of fair representation)
will not construct a tariff that will reduce the
customs revenue by £750,000 a year. Hitherto
the sandgroper minority, which wants its agricul-
tural and other industries protected, has made the
tariff. Very soon the majority from the East,
whose main industry—gold-mining—doesn’t need
any Protection, will make it instead ; and there is
no knowing with what results.
* • * *
Federation offers Westralia its first ehanee of
absolute manhood suffrage. Also its first chance
of an Old Age Pension system—Old Age Pensions
are one of the subjects transferred to the Federal
Government, and the democratic majority from
N.S.W., Victoria, and S.A. is certain to force the
matter on and get the aged Sanlgroper his pen-
sion at the earliest possible date. (The Sand-
groper, as a man who generally lives to a great
age, has a special interest in this matter.) It will
almost certainly bring about a measure of direct
taxation to make up for the abolition, after five
years, of the W.A. border customs—in other
words, the great English, South Australian,
Victorian, and other land and mining and trading
and banking syndicates which now own most of
Westralia will have to pay a larger _ share ot
Westralia’s expenditure. It gives the big, empty
province a fair chance of getting its transconti-
nental line built at the cost of all Australia, while
it is dead-certain that the rest of Australia won t
pay a single copper towards that line if W.A. doesn t
federate. It will quite possibly save W. A. from
having its industries crushed some day by I ree-
trade. A Federal Government, with all the nidus-
tries of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide
to protect, will never go in for Freetrade, while the
mining element in Westralia, when it gets on top,
might do so. A mining community is just the
one which Freetrade suits well enough. Ihe
sandgroper in general isn’t ail animal of dis-
course looking before and after ; yet he basil t to
look very far before him to see that there are
many good cash possibilities for him in I ederation.
Land Grant Kail way Swindles and
Other Swindles.
Tasmania has been giving away private railway
concessions of late with a generous hand, and its
Parliament is just now considering some more
matters of the same description. At present
it is busy giving a syndicate power to build
the Great Midland and West Coast Railway, 100
miles in length, and making the syndicate the
very handsome present of 200,000 acres of land by
way of encouragement. Tasmania’s reason for
making this ghastly foolish bargain is that it can t
afford—or thinks it can’t—to build the new wes-
tern railways itself, and it has the strange bee
humming in its brain that the said railways will
cost the country less if built and owned by a private
syndicate than if built and owned by the State.
It is such a grotesque idea that any com-
munity gifted with the power to see through
a large hole in the daytime (it being provided
that there is no obstruction in the _ hole) should
know better. But every Australasian State has
been seized, at one time or another, with the de-
lusion that in some way the community saves the
expense of a railway (that it gets the railway for
nothing, in fact, or at least gets it a great deal
more cheaply) by letting a crowd of private
boodlers build it than by doing the work on its
own account. In fact, some of them have that
crazy inspiration permanently.
* * * *
As a very simple and obvious matter of fact,
the average privately-owned railway must cost
the community vastly more than the publicly-
owned one, and Tasmania, by gridironing its
West Coast with syndicate land-grant lines, is
throwing heaps of its hard-earned money into the
sea. Assuming that the 100 miles of the Great
Midland line costs .£lO,OOO a mile for construction
and equipment, the Tasmanian State could build
it for <£1,000,000. It would do the good old bor-
row in London, and if it offered per cent, it
could get £1,000,000 net; that is to say, it could
sell the loan at a premium which would cover all
expenses. All the railway would have to provide
under Government ownership would therefore be
working expenses and £32,500 a year interest. If
the people are charged enough in freights and
fares to cover these outgoings—well and good. If
they are not, they are charged the difference in
some form of direct or indirect taxation. Either
way, the community pays the above amount and
no more.
* * * *
The private syndicate doesn’t build the line any
more cheaply than the State; it advertises for
tenders in the same way, and accepts the lowest
tender in the same way, and probably the
same contractor does the job. But it has
multitudes of extra expenses, from which the
State is free. It spends money shoving its Bill
through Parliament. Very often the syndicate
which gets the concession sells it to a company
for £lOO,OOO or £250,000 or £1,000,000 of clear
boodle according to the size of the job—which
simply means that it sells a certain portion of the
Tasmanian people to the co. for the purpose of
being squeezed, just as the monarchs of the
Middle Ages used to raise the wind by selling a
rich Jew or two, who seemed as if they would
crush well, to some speculative subject. This
necessarily increases the cost of the railway.
Then the private co. has to maintain an expensive
office in Tasmania, and generally another in Lon-
don (the State needs no office in London, and a
new railway makes only an imperceptible addition
to the cost of the already-existent railway offices);
it has to pay directors (the State needs no direc-
tors) ; it hires a manager (the State can run an extra
railway, or two, or three, or six, extra railways,
with the manager it has already) ; and it requires
enough rolling stock to cope with its traffic at the
busiest season (the State in many cases only re-
quires a little new rolling stock, and meets the de-
mands of extra busy periods by shifting cars and
locomotives from other lines where the closing of
the wheat or wool season has left things tempor-
arily slack).
* * * *
Then the syndicate has company-flotation ex-
penses to pay, also brokerage, advertising, and
multitudes of other charges, from which the State
is exempt. By reason of all these matters the line
which costs the State £1,000,000 seldom costs the
private syndicate less than £1,500,000. The pri-
vate co. generally borrows all that it can of this at
5 per cent, (the Emu Bay Railway Co., of Tas-
mania, is raising the wind at 5 per cent., and the
Wellington and Manawatu Co. pays the same
rate, while the Midland Co. of Maoriland paid no
less than 6 per cent, on its borrowings). Also, it
wants a 5 per cent, dividend, or more if possible,
on its own capital—the Silverton Railway Co.
charges enough to make a 50 per cent, dividend on
its capital. Therefore the private co. aims to make
the line pay working-expenses and at least 5 per
cent, on about £1,500,000 (£75,000 a-year), against
the State’s burden of working-expenses and 3|; per
cent, on £1,000,000 (£32,500). And the people of
the country where the line is located have to
supply the money in each case. It is as much the
people’s burden when a private syndicate finds the
capital as when the State finds the capital. The
million which the State would pay for the line ap-
pears in the statement of the public debt, and the
£1,500,000 which the syndicate pays does not,
but it is only a difference on paper. The people
owe the money either way, because they have to
pay the interest either way. The only difference
is that, when a private syndicate builds the line,
they have to find twice or three times as much
interest, and they pay the difference, partly in
higher rates and partly in land grants.
* * * *
Probably the Midland Railway will pay under
private management. Probably also it might not
pay (on paper) under State management. But the
circumstances are not the same. When the private
co. builds it, the State throws in 200,000 acres of
land (2,000 acres for every mile of line, or one-
eightieth part of the whole country), and the
splendid revenue which this estate will produce
when the railway has opened it up will go into the
railway co.’s revenue and make the line payable.
If the State built the line, it would get the revenue
from this land instead of the syndicate getting it,
only the money would go into the land receipts
instead of among the railway receipts, and the line
wouldn’t look payable. But if the State chose to
build the Midland line itself, and set apart the same
200,000 acres as an endowment for its own line
and paid the revenue received from these 200,000
acres into the railway treasury, then it could make
the line a great deal more profitable than the co.
can possibly do, and it could afford to charge 25
per cent, less fares and freights than the co. will
be able to do. When the results achieved by a
small private line with a gift of 200,000 acres of
land, are set against the results achieved by the
State on a similar line without the 200,000 acres
State management may not look any too profit-
able. But if both lines are put on the same basis,
then State management is immeasurably cheaper
for the people who have to find the interest.
There is no railway in Australasia which a private
co. can build and work at a profit which the
State, on similar conditions, can’t build and
work at an equal profit with 25 per cent,
lower charges. _ For the line that costs
the State a million generally costs the co.
£1,500,000 by reason of all its extra expenses';
and the State can get the money at 3| per cent.,
while the co. pays 5 per cent.
* * * «
Wherefore, the moral is that private railways
in Australia are a fraud and a robbery, and the
province which goes in for them doesn’t know
enough to take shelter under an ordinary wooden
verandah when it rains.
In the Wake of the Atacama.
After Mr. Sam. Smith’s exposure of the facts
in N.S.W. Assembly on 25th July, will the
Govt, insist on the passage of the Navigation
Bill this session ? Will it abolish the Marine
Board this session? —and take care that no
taint of the old rottenness pollutes the new
authority which is to supersede the Board ?
If the Govt, is too sluggish or too faint-hearted
to do its duty, will the Assembly compel it to
do its duty —this session ? Or will the session
pass, and coffin-ships still be permitted to leave
N.S.W. ports; perished steamers still be per-
mitted to trade in Sydney harbor ; boilers still
be left in charge of uncertificated men and boys
—to the certain peril and probable loss of valu-
able human lives?
* * * *
The Bulletin asks every member of Parlia-
ment who feels the responsibility of his posi-
tion to take an effective personal interest in
this matter, and to actively press for reform!
It asks Mr. Barton, Mr. Wise, Mr. Ashton,
Mr. Ewing, and a score of others who are
capable of thinking of something beyond party
warfare, not to let the matter drift, but to
press it at once to the desired conclusion.
Every gale on the coast, every breeze almost,
makes some of the vessels which trade about
these shores a menace to the community. Some
of them are unsafe to journey upon Sydney
harbor in, even in the calmest weather. At any
moment the marine death-roll may be length-
ened —for want of effective supervision of ships.
And to every member of Parliament who has
power to mend things the responsibility will
come home.
* * * *
What did Mr. Smith say? He said what
The Bulletin has been saying for years ; what
the Evening News and Telegraph proved
again the other day by fact and illustration
he said that the Marine Board was a negligent
and incompetent authority ; that its surveys
give no guarantee that a ship is sound and
seaworthy-—as the loss of the , and of the
, and of the prove ; that its certifi-
cates of soundness and seaworthiness are good
until a little more strain than ordinary comes—
a little more sea, a little more wind—and then
they are death certificates.
• * » *
Mr. Smith produced in Parliament portions
of perished plates, and perished girders,recently
taken from certificated and uncertificated
vessels—plates which had rusted away to a
sixteenth of their proper thickness; plates
from below the water-line so thin, so full of
holes, that they could be broken to pieces with
the lingers ; and he implored the Government
to end the state of things which permitted such
vessels to leave the wharves with crews and
passengers—sometimes hundreds of passengers,
on board. He gave ocular evidence of his
statements—so strong that Mr. See, a ship-
owner himself and in sympathy with ship-
owners, did not attempt to controvert it. He
could not controvert it.
• * * *
It is true that, since The Bulletin’s article
condemning the Marine Board for the loss of
the Atacama and 13 lives; since Premier
Reid poured new blood into the Marine Board ;
and since the repeated efforts of the Republic to
leave Sydney Harbor without a certificate of sea-
worthiness were frustrated, ship-owners have
begun to realise their situation. No doubt some
of the worst vessels have beenmended. Since the
agitation for the remorseless overhaul of all
vessels trading from and about N.S.W. ports
took shape, Mr. Smith asserts that the owners
of all sorts of rotten and neglected tubs have
rushed the docks for repairs. It is thus that
he was able to produce his perished plates, and
to affirm that the Marine Board has licensed
ferry-boats through whose sides, below water,
you could shove your fist —ferry-boats carrying
sometimes big crowds of excursionists.
* * * *
But the community is not yet safe—-not by a
long wav. As soon as ship-owners’ alarm is
over, things will fall into their old groove ; and
the unnecessary loss of human life is as sure as
the first big storm—or the first small accident.
Reform must come at once ; and care must ie
taken that no members of the old Marine Boat
are allowed to hamper it. The new authority
must be independent ; and its officers mus
independent—they must not hold their 1 e
on condition of placating interested ship-
owners.

The Bulletin suggests that the public them-
selves should move in a matter in which they
are so vitally interested ; and it suggests
Cardinal Moran and his religious antagonists
that, instead of squabbling over missions
the natives of Fiji and Samoa, they should
devote their energies to the work °f sau &
Australian lives—every day endangered white
conditions remain as at present. I hen j
would really earn the public gratitude.


The Bulletin has mentioned no names in
this statement of the case, although Mr. Smith
mentions them in his speech. But everyone
who journeys on Sydney harbour, or who
permits his family to do so, should digest the
facts and allegations in Hansard of July 25.
The daily press dares not fully report the
speech, thanks to the scandalous state of the
N.S.W. libel law.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Brisbane Telegraph’s “Gentleman.”
Brisbane Telegraph has another anti-Federal
ghost-yarn to tell :
A gentleman who knows something about the Com-
monwealth Bill asks the publicans and brewers of
Queensland if they are aware that under the Bill the
duties on spirits may be increased and the excise duties
doubled, without the local Parliament having a voice in
the matters. They do not know it now, but will hear it
by-and-by.
Another gentleman (who perhaps knows more
about the Commonwealth Bill than the above
gentleman) rises right here in this paper to ask
the publicans and brewers of Queensland if
they are aware that, under the Commonwealth
Bill, the Federal Parliament can reduce their
oppressive spirit duty of 145.-a gallon to 12s.
as in Victoria, and their import duty on beer in
bulk of Is. 3d.-a-gallon to 10d., as in Victoria,
despite the frautie resistance of the oppressive
Brisbane Parliament. Also, that it can reduce
Queensland’s 3d.-a-gallon beer excise to 2d., as
in Victoria ; and the 125.-a-gallon spirit excise
to Bs., as in Victoria; and the ls.-per-lb.
tobacco excise to 9d., and the 25.-per-lb. cigar
excise to 9d.—both as in Victoria. The Bris-
bane Legislature, which has refused per-
sistently to do these commendable actions it-
self, won’t be able to prevent it—providing
Queensland federates. If Queensland doesn’t
federate then Brisbane Parliament can keep
the duties at the present high rate and still
make the life of the Queensland brewer and
publican and tobacco-grower and manufacturer
a misery. But as for the Federal Parliament
doubling the Queensland duties—well, in that
case it would have to raise the duties all
round, for all duties are to be uniform. And
N.S.W. and Victoria show no desire to pay ill
4s. per gallon excise on their whisky—especially
Victoria, which has been accustomed to pay Bs.
Of course, the Federal Parliament could in-
crease rates—just as the present Queensland
Parliament could pass a law for boiling every-
body alive. But it won’t do it. It will level-
down Queensland’s unspeakable excise charges
to something near a civilised level, and give
the Queensland manufacturer the show which
his local Legislature has never had sense enough
to afford. The South, which has been accus-
tomed to something like a sane and decent
tariff—not the awful kind of thing which sits
on the head of local industry in Queensland —
will want to argue the point anyhow.
The Federal Plural-Vote Lie.
A curious lie raised by the Queesnsland paro-
chialists is t o the effect that the Federal Consti-
tution doesn’t really provide for one-man-one-
vote. Clauses 8 and 30 declare that, whatever
the Federal franchise may be, nobody shall vote
more than once at elections for either Federal
House. But clause 41, by way of safeguarding
the woman suffrage, says :
No adult person who has or acquires a right (only one
right, be it observed.—Ed. B.) to vote (not to vote more
than once, but only to vote.—Ed. B.) for the more numer-
ous House of the Parliament of a State shall, while the
right continues, be prevented by any law of the Common-
wealth from voting (not from voting twice or six times,
but merely from voting.—Ed. B.) at elections of either
House of the Parliament of the Commonwealth.
And some parochial liars up north are trying
hard to explain, despite the twice-repeated
enactment that nobody shall vote more than
once at any Federal election, and despite the
fact that clause 41 simply conserves the right
of every State elector to vote (not to have a
dozen votes) at Federal elections, that this is a
proviso by which the plural voter is to be pre-
served in the Commonwealth. It is a poor,
small, one-eyed lie—but the Queensland paro-
chialists haven’t invented a good lie of their
own yet. The only really decent lies in the
Federal campaign, and there were some very
good ones, came from N.S. W.
A Story about MTntyre.
The long-delayed trial of lawyer MTntyre
came to pass at Melb. Criminal Court last week,
with the long-expected result that the prisoner,
having been found guilty of fraud by a unani-
mous jury, was let out on bail to await a pro-
bable quashing of the verdict by the Full
Court. For the Full Court is learned in the Law,
and the Law, which is said to be a h’ass even
when it looks most like a rogue, seems to have
been specially designed to keep dishonest law-
yers and trustees out of prison. The Law loves
trustees because they are very apt to be lawyers
also. Alex. Grant MTntyre, for instance,
was both a lawyer (he is still on the rolls)
and a trustee. As a trustee he defrauded
young man Cogdon, his brother-in-law, by
converting to his own use a valuable property
—to wit, a mortgage over land—which his con-
fiding relative had entrusted to his keeping.
The details of the case can be taken as read.
It will suffice to say that MTntyre’s own
counsel protested against the trial of his client
for criminal fraud in these words: “ There
could be no doubt but that MTntyre was
amenable under the law relating to trustees.
As far as criminal law was concerned, it was
patent that . . . the document which Cogdon
had signed had created MTntyre a trustee,
and as such he could not be prosecuted
under the criminal law, even if he had
converted the property entrusted to him to
his own use.” Chief-Justice Madden solemnly
remarked that “this was the real difficulty in
the case.” MTntyre’s defence was, firstly,
that he acted for Cogdon as a brother-in-law
rather than as a solicitor, and that if he did act
as a solicitor he was not amenable to gaol, in-
asmuch as Cogdon had created him trustee of
the property which he (MTntyre) embezzled,
stole, stuck-to, converted to his own use, or
what you will. The guilt of MTntyre was
Tearly proved. The fact of his having stolen
much more money than the average thief who
gets (say) three years penal servitude for a first
offence, was a fact that “ stuck out a mile ” all
the time, but the Law seemed so favorable to
MTntyre that the Chief-Justice spoke of him
as a man who ought not to be tried by a
jury at all. His Honor said, however, that
“he would take advantage of the presence of
the jury to have certain special questions
answered by them.” The special questions
were put, and the answers were to the effect
that M'lntyre had converted Cogdon’s pro-
perty to his own use in the dual capacity of
lawyer and trustee, and not in the capacit}' of
a brother-indaw. Whereupon Justice Madden
said, “ the logical sequence of the finding, in
his opinion, was a verdict of not guilty ,” but lie
gave the jury the option of expressing its
real opinion of M ‘lntyre in one or two words.
The jury foreman expressed it very neatly—
“ln the matter of law we are in the hands of
his Honor. On the matter of the deed , we
unanimously find the accused guilty.” After
which the privileged doer of the guilty deed
was released on bail as before, and the whole
question was reserved for the Full Court, and
if the Full Court upholds the conviction of this
lawyer-trustee The Bulletin will be pleasantly
astounded.
♦
Interpreting the Constitution.
Some learned and fathomless pessimists in the
anti-Federal interest are moaning considerably
on the bar about the alleged excessive powers
entrusted by the Commonwealth Bill to the
Federal judiciary. As one Jenkinson, M.P.,
complains in Gympie Truth (Queensland) :
The Federal High Court is to be the sole interpreter
of the Constitution of the Commonwealth and also that
of the several States.
Jenkinson and other critics complain that this
is very, very dreadful, and that the same sys-
tem has made the U.S. Supreme Court an awful
tyranny. Yet if they have any better plan to
propose they keep it so very d irk that not a
hint of it has yet reached the public. At pre-
sent, the Supreme Court is the sole interpreter
of the laws in all the Australias, and in every
civilised country some similar tribunal does the
same thing. In a few purely barbarous coun-
tries a despot interprets the laws himself with a
club or with his teeth, but these are ex-
ceptional cases. The business of the civil
courts is to interpret the laws, and every law
in every civilised country is subject to the
interpretation of the courts. If they decide (as
the N.S. W. courts did re the original land tax
law) that the law doesn’t say what Parliament
meant it to say, and that it is unworkable and
contradictory, then the law is a dead letter till
Parliament repairs it. The Supreme Court
annuls it, not in so many words but to all in-
tents and purposes, on the ground that it is an
unworkable measure. When the Federal
Constitution becomes one of the laws of Aus-
tralia the courts will presumably interpret it
when necessary, as they do any other law.
Either they must do it, or it must be done by
the policeman, or the bishop, or the pea-nut
man, or the J.P., or the C.P.S., or somebody,
and perhaps the High Court will do it as well
as anybody. The Court can’t enforce the law
without interpreting it, and if it isn’t allowed
to enforce this particular law—well, what is
the good of having any such law at all ? Yet,
as a matter of fact, the Jenkinsons and other
learned pessimists don’t know what they
are talking about, for, curiously enough, the
Federal Constitution doesn’t give the High Court
power to interpret the Constitution at all. It
merely says (clause 76): “ The Parliament may
make laws conferring original jurisdiction on
the High Court in any matter arising under
this Constitution or involving its interpreta-
tion, or arising under any laws made by the
Parliament.” It may do so, but it isn’t bound
to do so, and the power of conferring on the
High Court authority to interpret the Consti-
tution also implies power to take away that
authority if the High Court misuses it. So
there is no analogy between the Australian and
the U.S. position in this matter; and the al-
leged tyrannous control of the U.S. Supreme
Court over the Legislature has nothing at all
to do with the case.

A Voice from the Sunset.
“ T’othersider ” writes to The Bulletin :
The Federal camp in West Australia is brooding mourn-
fully on the situation, wondering if Premier Forrest will
be clever enough to evade the direct issue. The first
move in his game is the relegation of his Bill to a Select
Committee of both Houses, instructed to bring up a re-
port by sth Sept. This is intended to give courage to the
Leg. Council. Members of Assembly are afraid of their
seats, and they will on present appearance pass the Bill
to the people ; but the Council is in the road. In a land
reeking with ignorant pride and fatuous prejudice, the
Council stands supreme for both. It is the holy of
holies of Groperdom. Probably no Upper House in
the world is steeped in such a dense fog of
ten - for -a - penny parochialism. Compared with it
the Upper House of N.S.W. is a hotbed of anarchy, and
the Forty-eight Rich Landlords of Victoria are revolu-
tionaries and dynamitards. So the Federal camp awaits
in gloom, spoiling for a fight, but afraid that the enemy
may not come within striking distance. The Government
actuary has concocted a mess of statistics that would turn
Coohlan green and purple with envy. For clear and
pellucid taradiddles the figures overlie anything that
statistics have ever attempted before. The tariff impost
on food and produce is the basis of the whole concoction.
Each year, as local production increases, the revenue
therefrom is rapidly decreasing. But the W.A.
Coohlan assumes that in the first year of uni-
form duties (two years after the establishment of
the Commonwealth—say, three years from now) the W.A.
tariff on food and produce will bring in the same as last
year. The present rate of decrease is L'60,000 a year, next
year the decrease will probably be £BO,OOO and so on. In
three years the revenue from this source will be very
small indeed, Federation or no Federation. This does
not matter to the Groper Coohlan. He stands firmly on
the quicksand of the 1898 figures, oblivious of the gaping
deficit that already appears in the 1899 figures.
The people of Westralia do not care a rap for
the figures of screech from the anti-federal statis-
tician. They want Federation. On the goldfields the
unanimity of this aspiration is almost monotonous.
Editor Kirwan (Kalgoorlie Miner) says it is practically im-
possible to find a man who is against the Commonwealth
Bill. In Perth, the big meetings have been so one-sided,
that there is no disposition to continue them. The
Federalists compose 99 per cent, of the audiences. The
National League (of parochialists) has driven one well-
intentioned journalist insane, and he has been shipped to
England, after chasing his doctor round the yard with a
pitchfork. This marvellous League has now commis-
sioned the paschal lamb called C. E. Jones, and as paid
lecturer, he addresses small but unanimous bodies of
Gropers, who have not heard the story of the mint sauce.
It is a sick cause that needs C. E. Jones for its stipen-
diary lecturer.
Westralia is particularly favored by the Commonwealth
, Bill, as it gets more than its arithmetical representation
in both Houses. If it joins the Commonwealth as an
1 original State, it secures this minimum of representation
for all time. It may, if it chooses, for five years after the
imposition of the uniform tariff, impose duties on goods
coming from the other States. This will bring extra
revenue to its Treasury, and give extra protection to its
producers. This is not forced upon Westralia, but is
optional. During this period, and for ever afterwards,
the markets of the Eastern States will be open to it, if it
should have produce of any kind to send.
• Constitutionally, Westralia will acquire a democratic
Government, payment of members in both Houses, both
Houses based on manhood suffrage, abolition of plural
voting, abolition of Fatman as boss in federal politics ; it
will practically throw off theyoke of thepolitical bounders
who now run the show ; it will become a factor in a
nation, instead of a joint in John Forrest’s political tail.
In the Commonwealth, Westralia’s fortune would be
established on the basis of good government, instead of
tottering precariously on the shifting sands of Perth
intrigue.

Bureaucratic Blundering.
“ Frank” forwards what looks like a very real
grievance :
(1) Tamworth, a N.S.W. town of some 5000 inhabitants,
badly needed a water supply. Tamworthians obtained
water from a town pump, situated in the centre of
the town ; the well was on a river flat, liable to
pollution from percolation of sewage and other abomina-
tions through the porous soil. Consequently, occasional
outbreaks of typhoid, influenza, and other diseases
ascribed to insanitary conditions, kept the doctors and
undertakers busily occupied. (N.B.— Though the Govt,
water supply scheme has been carried out at enormous
expense the same old town pump is still in requisition !)
(2) At the outset Tamworth City Fathers engaged Mr.
Gipps, C.E., to formulate a scheme. That gentleman
proposed a source of supply from a weir on Cockhurn
River. Total catchment area, about 300 sq. miles. He
submitted plans and specifications of the whole work,
including reticulation of the town estimated cost,
£17,500.
(3) Next, another citizen pointed out some defects in
Mr. Gipps’ scheme, notably the liability to pollution,
through induction of supply from weir to service-reser-
voir through open conduits. He suggested, as an unfail-
ing source of supply, Moonbi Springs, situated at the foot
of Moonbi Range, at an elevation slightly above the site
of the proposed weir. Mr. Gipps cordially endorsed the
suggestion, having noted the Springs while carrying out
his survey. The cost to the council of Mr. Gipps’ survey
and computations amounted to £250.
(4) Then the Government chipped in. The Works De-
partment having suggested a pumping scheme in the
interim (an infernally nasty scheme at that, which was
denounced and discarded) rushed to the fray, infuriate,
as usual, at the resistance offered to its initial design,
and persistently resolved to continue its destructive
career to the bitter end. Officials were sent up to design
a scheme having for its source of supply a flow anywhere
but in the Moonbi locality. But, as Nature has located
there the only available source from which a water-supply
for Tamworth can be economically derived, the task was
simply impossible. Nevertheless, the officials did the
best they could to defeat Nature’s beneficence.
(5) The Parliamentary Committee on Public Works
visited the afflicted borough and took evidence on a
scheme of supply from Moore Creek —catchment area
about 20 sq. miles. Officials swore that this area would
be sufficient, with average rainfall, to supply water-
power to light the town with electricity, to furnish
domestic needs—in fact, to fill the bill as to municipal
requirements. Evidence to the effect that the stream to
feed the proposed reservoir was a miserable trickle at
best, and that the locality had been often dry as a bone,
was contemptuously rejected, because of the ipse dixit
of the unimpeachable officials of the Works— vide Par-
liamentary reports.
(6) The Government scheme was carried out, in spite of
remonstrance by intelligent citizens. The local press not
only lied its best—or worst —to aid official iniquity, but
also suppressed to the utmost of its power all evidence
adverse to the Government design. The result has been
most disastrous waste of public money, intolerable
financial burdening of the ratepayers, and infliction of
insanitary misery. The costly reservoir during the
drought held only a stinking mud-pool which had to be
cleaned out. Five inches of rain fell, and even this
copious downpour only raised the water to lift, in the
reservoir. Where is the 40-h.p. Pelton-wheel which the
officials spoke of in a report that equalled in mendacity
any wild-cat prospectus ever slung at an unsuspecting
public? There isn’t 40-cat-power, nor any power, nor
any flow, to bear out the promises to the borough made
by allegedly-responsible officials, and, through them, by
the Works Department, as inducement to accept respon-
sibility for the cost of a work that is practically inutile.
Worse, it is a "Jwhite elephant of the 'most expensive
description ; for when water is let into the pipes from the
supply reservoir the pressure is higher than the capacity
of the weakly-constructed pipes, which burst and leak
consumedly, and have to be repaired, keeping men con-
stantly employed. Moreover, the water is unfit for
human consumption as a beverage. At one time it was
too malodorous even to bathe in.
Lastly—As there is hardly a scintilla of truth or
accuracy in the reports of the officials, or in the evidence
tendered to the P.C. on Public Works in favor of the
job, what is to result from this blistering expose of the
culminating instance of a long series of bureaucratic
blunders, departmental malfeasance, and the pernicious
existence of an odious Parliamentary excrescence like
the Works Committee, which evidently hasn’t discern-
ment enough to perceive a hole in a ladder until it col-
lides violently with the sides and rungs thereof ?
-
The Importance of Averting 1 Simpson.
The Bill which was left unfinished during last
session of N.S.W. Parliament, authorising one
Simpson to build a bridge connecting Sydney
and North Sydney, and the other Bill autho-
rising one Sulman to do something similar, are
both to crop up again this session. These two
persons appear to have got so much in the
habit of cropping up that they, or some others
like them, will probably keep on cropping
till they either get their bridge concession,
or the State, or the municipality, puts a sudden
and violent end to their hopes by building the
bridge itself. Therefore, it is desirable to hit
the public again with a list of the principal
reasons why the State or the municipality
should build the bridge in question, and why
it should reject the offers of the whole Simpson
clan with loathing, and crush Sulman remorse-
lessly :
(1) Bridge-building, according to all Australian prece-
dent, is a matter of State or municipal—not private—
enterprise. All over Australia the State is the bridge-
builder, and it would be bursting up a fine substantial
precedent to let private enterprise begin fooling at this
late hour with things it has practically no experience of.
(2) The State can build the bridge more cheaply than
Simpson can. It hasn't to float a company, or to give
preference-shares to any promoter; or to pay directors’
fees, or manager’s salary, or office rent—its own staff in
the Public Works Department can do all that is neces-
sary. And it doesn’t start as the private enterprise
generally does, by taking the “concession” to London
and selling it to a company for £250,000, wherefore a
bridge that ought to cost £1,000,000 really costs, under the
private enterprise system, at least £1,250,000.
(3) The State, if it must needs borrow, can raise the
necessary £1,000,000 or so at 3 per cent. Simpson’s credit
isn’t as good as that of the State. His eo. will probably
borrow most of the money for construction purposes at 5
per cent., and it will want at least 5 per cent, dividends
on its own money.
(4) Therefore if Simpson, or any other Simpson, builds
the North Sydney bridge, he will have to charge the
public who use that bridge enough to pav 5 per cent, on
(probably) £1,250,000 (fc’62,500 a year), or £1,500,000
(075,000 a-year), where the State would only need to
charge them enough to pay 3 per cent, on £1,000,000
(£30,000 a year). In other words, Simpson would need
to charge twice as heavy a toll as the State would.
(5) There is no evidence that Simpson will supply the
bridge any sooner than the State would do. Private
enterprise is pitiably slow in many cases. Maoriland
handed over the Midland railway concession to a co.
because it couldn’t see its way to build the line for a few
years to come, and the co. fooled round for nine years
and hardly got started. The concession which Tasmania
granted to its Great Western railway syndicate has
already expired and the co. isn’t even formed yet. Tha
whole time has been wasted hawking the concession
round in London.
(6) If Simpson builds the bridge the excessive tolls
which private enterprise will have to charge will presently
raise a crj’ for State resumption. The probable end will
be that the State will pay IJ4 millions or more for a
structure which it could have built for half the money.
(7) If the movement for amalgamating the 41 munici-
palities of Sydney comes off, then the new city of Greater
Sydney will be strong and rich enough to build its own
bridges and make a decent profit out of them—if the
State doesn’t feel like doing the work itself. The new
municipality—if there is any reasonable prospect of such
a thing—should at least get a chance to do the work
before any Simpson is granted a monopoly of this magni-
tude.
The North Sydney bridge proposal should cer-
tainly be laid before Parliament and the Public
Works Committee again this session as a public
undertaking in the hope that it may have
better luck, than it has met with up to date.
And the Committee should be invited to con-
sider, not only the possible profit or want of
profit which the community will make by
building the bridge itself, but the certain awful
loss to the community if Simpson builds it, and
the obvious fact that if the community doesn’t
do it, some Simpson or other is almost certain
to lay his hands on the concession in the long
run. In other words, this public enterprise
needs to be considered in two aspects —as a
possible means of direct profit, and as a certain
means of saving great direct loss arising through
Simpson. The urgent necessity for averting
Simpson hasn’t been properly considered.
Simpson (w r hose bridge hasn’t to run the
gauntlet of the Public Works Committee) will
almost certainly get there some day unless the
State puts its own bridge right on top of Simp-
son and thus ends the danger.
Gaily proceeds the rumpus between Cardinal
Moran and the resenters of his aspersions upon
Protestant missionaries ; and, without offering
an opinion about the merits of the dispute, The
Bulletin has to say that, as a polemic, Car-
dinal Moran has more about him of the clumsy
hedge-priest than of the “Prince of the Church.”
There was also a gross strategical blunder, for
one thing, in the silly and easily-disprovable as-
sertion that the Protestant missionaries wanted
the British war-ships to fire upon the women and
children at the Samoan Catholic mission-house.
When the Cardinal assails another faith, it is
strictly that faith’s “ own funeral,” but when
he insults the common sense of the community
upon a matter of ordinary humanity and manli-
ness, he travels into a different critical category,
seriously damages his cause, and makes himself
personally ridiculous. For the rest, if the Pro-
testant champions have been as blatant and
blatherskity as usual, the Cardinal has also ad-
hered to his crude controversial traditions of
making foolishly acrimonious assertions and
then clumsily trying to evade the issue. Patrick
F. considers, doubtless, that he owes it to the
designation “ Cardinal ” to be keen of thrust
and deft of recovery, but the shillelah is obvi-
ously more native to his hand than the rapier.
Dr. Stawell, lecturing to Melbourne medical
students, condemned the maintenance of found-
ling hospitals, on the ground that the mortality
among infants artificially fed is enormous. The
doctor’s philosophy and morality set out from
the wrong end of the subject he handles.
Foundling hospitals are necessary, and must be
maintained, because, as human society exists,
foundlings will continue to be born. Some may
be killed by artificial diet, but many more will be
killed if there be no hospital to house them, and
they consequently, as likely as not, get no diet
at all. The demand of a new child to be main-
tained falls upon the mother only as an incident
which she may or may not be able to discharge,
but falls upon the community as a duty which
it must discharge with or without the will of
the mother. If foundling-hospital dietary be
not scientifically perfect, the community must
improve it—make it perfect, if possible ; but
the community, because it distrusts its con-
densed milk, must not primarily, by giving no
milk at all, excite mothers to murder the I '' off-
spring.
While all the world, and notably the Rhodes
crowd, has been waxing eloquent and militant
over the Transvaallers’ troubles, the existence
of similar troubles in Rhodesia has been kept
quietly in the background. The Transvaal
Lfitlanders’ chief complaints are with reference
to the questions of franchise disabilities and
monopolistic taxation. Yet they are in far
better case than the people of the country
which sent Jameson to their alleged rescue, and
Rhodes, who grieves so bitterly over Oom
Paul’s alleged tyranny, is a worse tyrant than
Paul. The charter of the British South Africa
Co. nominally provides for universal suffrage in
the election of members of the council which
holds the controlling power in Chartered terri-
tory, but then the suffrage can be used in the
election of four only of the 11 members form-
ing the Council ; the remaining seven are chosen
in the interests of the capital represented by
the co., and are avowedly (as per report) running
the country in the interests of the co.’s dollars.
Then as to taxation : in the Transvaal the
mining industry is taxed to the extent of 14
per cent, of the divs. earned, whereas in
Rhodesia all dividends are taxed in the mini-
mum 33 1-3, and in maximum 50 per cent. The
co. has also mortgages in the shape of con-
cessions on water-supply rights, market dues,
land-leasing, &c., &c., and altogether it seems
to out-Paul ’Oom Paul himself in disfranchising
and taxing all things and all men excepting
those of its own household.
“ G.S.” : Re W.A. Early Closing Act :
A Perth magistrate says it appears to him that, the pro-
vision prev anting employes from remaining on business
premises . ithe day they are due for a holiday will, if
enforced, interfere with the liberty of one lot of sub-
jects, and, if not enforced, with that of another lot. He
suggests as a remedy a compulsory day’s work of 8 hours,
no more, no less, and sa.vs that if there were no such
thing as overtime then there would be fewer men out of
work. Sound sense in this, though I have heard rabid
laborites oppose the latter proposition because it would
interfere with the liberty of the subject. A workman
ought, they said, to be allowed to work as long hours as
he liked, and earn as much as he could. The fellow
workman without employment did not enter into their
calculations. There is another sensible Perth P.M. who
would £ive every free adult a vote and compel him to
i record it under penalty of loss of civil rights for three
. years, maximum.

The “King’s Musketeer” (Henry Hamil-
ton’s version) opened with a blaze of glory at Her
Majesty’s (Sydney) on Saturday, and a vast crowd
assembled to Compare it with Bernard Espinasse’s
version, recently presented by Rignold at the
Criterion. In a purely literary sense, Espinasse’s
edition beat Hamilton’s in several places. The
Australian man’s drama has a tendency to do
things; in the English version people have a
lamentable habit of coining in and stating that
tilings have been done. Tins was so noticeable in
some places that the present scoffer began to think
of writing another “Musketeer” all on his own,
with D’Artagnan and Miladi left out, also Athos,
Porthos, Aramis and Richelieu, but with a suc-
cession of people bursting in to tell the king how
these persons are getting on. Hamilton’s version
also centres round the ill-fated diamonds which
Anne of Austria gave to her gorgeous lover,
Buckingham ; and the frantic journey of the four
musketeers to London to recover them, and thus
establish an alibi. But the whole episode of the
jewels is crowded into one act; the curtain goes
down on the musketeers departing, and it rises
three minutes after to find D’Artagnan bursting
in ten days later with the recovered property, and
telling about the innumerable bloodshed which
had happened on the road. This haste spoils the
episode. There isn’t so much bare shoulder in
Hamilton’s version as in the previous one, where
Miladi’s dress was torn off so liberally to exhibit
the place where her beautiful flesh had been done
brown by the executioner ; but, on the other hand,
the present drama has the more definite ending.
Miladi ends her career with some kind of poison
(possibly carbolic acid) which makes her writhe
horribly, and shriek dismally, and pound herself
to death on the floor. Hamilton’s drama is at
least ten shrieks ahead of its rival and predecessor.
* * * »
The “King’s Musketeer” is gorgeously
mounted, richly painted, richly dressed, and
played by a strong company. Miss Henrietta
Watson —who has developed a striking like-
ness to sister Elizabeth since Australia saw her
last —is a beautiful siren, and her adventuress
is a beautiful, convincing, and expensively-
dressed personage. Miss Eniilie Hughes is an
ideal Queen. The tremendous Augustus Glover
is Porthos—he is the only man on the Australian
stage imposing enough for that mountainous
musketeer, and he is the most absolutely soul-
satisfying person among the male characters.
George Majeroni’s Aramis and Athohvood’s
Mosqueton are close up. Cecil Ward, fine actor
as he is, looks too plump and gentle and affable
for the gaunt D’Artagnan; and Harry Plimmer
is of too copious a build for Athos. ’ Bentley’s
Richelieu is a strong, effective character, with an
occasional tendency to drop into Scotch, and to
allude to the animal which toils in front of a cab
as a “harse.” The author makes Louis XIII. a
cheerful cackling idiot (Espinasse’s version went
one worse, and represented him as a grumpy kind
of burglar or dog-stealer), and though Harry Hill
makes him cackle amusingly, this sort of thing is
rough on a rather respectable king. Still, the
people herein grumbled at would look admirable
in worse company. The Queen and Miladi are so
good, and Porthos is so stupendous, that they
overshadow the surroundings ; besides it is diffi-
cult to live up to the clothes and the
scenic effects. The “King’s Musketeer” is
a good show in a general way, and Bent-
ley*s allusions to a “harse” are not mentioned
in any unfriendly spirit. If it makes the animal
any less jtmipy when one is on him, or any less
unpleasant when one drops off him, then this
writer is willing to call him anything.

Tn the short closing season of the “ Belle
of New York ” Albert Whela.n managed to leave
on the sands of dramatic art the biggest footprint
he has made on that shifting substance up to date.
He took the part of Ichabod Bronson, vice poor
Oscar Girard, who was partly dying and partly
dead. For so short a time it probably wasn’t
worth while to think out a new Ichabod, so
Whelan simply borrowed Girard’s character
whole. It was the same to a ham and an
accent and a leer —such an amazing effort
of mimicry that penurious Scotch persons
lost their money betting that Girard’s alleged
illness was only some complicated advertising
dodge, and that he had assumed the new name of
Whelan for purposes unknown. And now em-
bittered Scotch persons are looking for William-
son to point out that the saxpence they lost should
be handed over to them and deducted from
Whelan’s salary.

The five nights revival of “Mrs. Tan-
queray ” at Sydney Royal should have been a
great occasion, for the co. put its entire soul into
Pinero’s great tragedy, and the Brough co. has a
lot of soul when the occasion calls for it. The fact
that it was only a moderate occasion is another
evidence of the cussedness of inanimate objects—
the inanimate object in this case being the Sydney
public. The only thing that was notably wrong
with the latest version of “Mrs. Tanqueray” was
Brough himself, as Cayley Drummle. He did
excellent work—but there are at least a dozen
different Broughs, and this was one of the wrong
Broughs. Theone who wouldhavefilled the part to
perfection was the quiet, lazy, cynical man with
the dark moustache, and tlie soft, lazy hat, and
the horizontal manner, who appeared in the
“Summer’s Day.” And instead of this, when
Brough went to the place where he keeps himself
hung up in a row ready for immediate use, he
selected himself wrongly; he took a rather
sketchy, clean shaved, hurried kind of Brough
with light fhair r~ 1 light eyebrows, who didn’t
leave a sharp, clear-out impression on the audience.
Possibly he was late, and snatched himself off the
nail in a hurry, and thus got the wrong person
unintentionally. Cayley Drummle was a good
character, but the other Brough would have
looked him ever so much better.
* * * *
For the rest Mrs. Brough put all her fine
abilities into Paula, and did that tragic woman
admirably, and Joseph Carne, who had the large
contract of being Titheradge’s successor in the
part of Aubrey Tanqueray, did it so well that
Titheradge wasn’t much missed. It is a part
where the quiet, strong man tills the bill, and that
sort of man is Joseph Carne’s best point. Miss
Noble filled her old place as the frozen saint; and
Miss Temple filled hers as the lady of easy Flossie-
dom upon whom George Orreyed had wasted his
bright young nose, and his two waving legs, and
for whom he had dropped all his prospects in the
decanter. There was a new George Orreyed—
Leslie Victor doing the easy character of the
young man who had rashly bestowed his weak
head, and his hiccup, and his tendency to break
things, upon an unworthy object. Also Lovell
had the thankless part of Hugh Ardale, which
didn’t give him the show he deserved. Taken all
round the latest “Tanqueray” was a deserving
performance, and by the time the short season is
over, and the “Brixton Burglary” follows on
Saturday, Sydney will, probably, have just begun
to wonder why it didn’t go oftener.

“ The Birthright,” which arose at Sydney
Opera House this week, is a tale of the Emerald
Isle, in which the rise of the curtain discovers a
dining-room with an interrupted dinner-party.
The red-faced attorney, Mr. Quinlan, drunk with
sherry and mad with rage, is shaking his fist, on
general principles, at the retreating figure of Mr.
Walsh, of Walsh’s Hall (Mr. Douglas). Mr. Cut-
liff, senr., soon recalls him to more serious busi-
ness, and tells Mr. Quinlan how in the days of his
burning youth Lord Fitzgerald (his brother) went
through a mock marriage with Dora Dillon, the
usual pretty peasant girl. Mr. Walsh acted as
priest, and poor Dora believed herself really and
truly married. After her son was born, she was
told the truth, and she disappeared. A mutilated
female corpse cast up by the deceiving sea was be-
lieved to be the end of her. Mr, Cutliff is anxious
that Mr. Quinlan, as Lord Fitz’s legal gentleman,
should u»e his influence to get young Bob Cutliff
all the cash and property, as well as the title, and
that the love-boy, Justin, should be fired out to
battle with a cold, cold world. Mr. Quinlan
cheerfully promises to see to it. Out on the breezy
upland above the castle Justin is having a delight-
ful time with Lady Elsie (Miss Billie Howarde),
Lord Fitz’s neice, a dainty little lady of seventeen
who floats about in a white gown and white straw
hat tied with yellow strings in a bow just beside
the little.dimple near her mouth. Justin envies
that bow. Young Bob Cutliff, who wants Lady
Elsie as well as all the cash, all the property and
all the title, finds the two talking of “glorious
things ” in the drawing-room and proceeds to tell
Justm that he is a nobody and that his mother was
worse. He gets nearly strangled for his trouble.
* • * *
Acts 2 and 3 find Justin taking to drink
when Lady Elsie floats in and puts her arms
round him and tells him he can kiss her—if he
likes. And the fool only kisses her once. From
that time out lie lost all public sympathy.
Elsie has to remind him that before the row he
kissed her shoes, and then he does pull him-
self together and declare himself ready to
do so again, and Elsie tells him the mouth is
much more convenient—and he kisses it again,
once. Justin meets his supposed dead mother
talking to somebody in a graveyard, and she blesses
him without revealing her identity. She is living
in a lonely mill, and Mr. Quinlan and the Cutliffs
set fire to it, and it flames up on the stage, and
Dora screams and heaves herself into the river,
and Justin heaves himself in after her. Then Mr.
Walsh, stricken with remorse, decides to tell all
he knows. It is to the effect that when he per-
formed that alleged mock marriage he was a priest
in holy orders, and that the marriage was legal.
Truly, he had retired from active church service
in order to devote more time to the whisky bottle,
but that made no difference. It’s cheap London
Journal sort of literature, but Billie Howarde,
as Lady Elsie, Mr. Walsh, Old Lindsay and Lord
Fitzgerald have a lot of human nature, and play
their parts naturally.

The Sydney Lyceum drama here de-
nounced with such frank and unobtrusive objur-
gation last week, has undergone no change
that this paper is aware of. The huge dredge
dredges away patiently, and it is respectfully
recommended as the only dredge on the stage
within the writer’s knowledge. To everything
else in the drama he is as disrespectful as he
knows how to be, and he would be more disrespect-
ful if he was able to.

Harry Rickards is making a few farewell
appearances at Sydney Tivoli,“prior to a visit to
Europe and America ; but the great Cinquevalli is
so big an item at the Tiv., that even Rickards’s
departure attracts little notice. Cinquevalli has
lately taken to heaving clothes in the air with his
feet, and they fit themselves on to them when they
come down in a marvellous manner. He is cap-
able of putting on all his clothes this way, likewise
his boots and jewellery ; but there are difficulties
about doing this before a mixed audience. Also
he knows a peculiar trick whereby he can blow
his tailor’s bill backwards off his ear, and it
rebounds from the wall and comes back paid.

Next Tuesday (August 8) all the theatrical
companies of Sydney are combining to give a
great afternoon performance at Her Majesty’s in
aid of the Victoria Consumptive Home. It is a
good cause and deserves support. The pity is
that the old useful consumptive home at Thirl-
mere, so long supported by Mr. Goodlet out of his
own funds—the home that wasn’t fashionable nor
“Victoria,” but just good solid charity—didn’t
have the same sort of thing happen to it -ftener.
* * * *
Miss Helen Hart, the well-known lady
lecturer and sturdy supporter of many good but
unorthodox causes, intends giving a series of lec-
tures in and around Sydney. The first one, on
temperance, will be delivered at Manly on Mon-
day, Bth August.
On Monday night the “Kelly Gang”
clanked into Sydney Criterion. The show that
swam through blood at the Opera House has been
enlarged a good deal. Kennedy is still shot by
the gory Dan ; Fitzpatrick still washes out his in-
sult to Kate Kelly with his own blood ; and Aaron
Sherritt still dies howling. An extra act is inter-
polated, and shows the gay time the Kellys have
when they stick up Glenrowan Hotel. There is a
stranded theatrical co. there, and when the Kellys
get tired of grog they bring in the stranded
theatricals at the point of the rifle, and command
them to be funny or die on the spot; whereupon
the mummers become wildly hilai’ious to save
their lives. After that comes the train-wrecking
attempt, and the place is full of wild horsemen,
and black trackers, and smell of gun and whisky.
*
“The War of Wealth,” at Melb. Royal,
strikes one as being the largest and most promising
melodrama that Bland Holt has set up since “The
White Heather.” It gets away from London and
Paris, for a healthy change, and the plot has
nothing to do with racecourses, baronets, restaur-
ants, adventuresses, genteel poverty, or the “lower
orders.” None of the characters wear spats, eve-
glasses, or coster suits cut saucy over the trotters.
The girl who went wrong before the curtain rose
seems to have been mislaid or purposely omitted ;
and if the drama contains any references to
Walter Baker’s dear old home and loving Dad,
The Bulletin didn’t hear them the other night.
Probably Dad is dead and the dear old home cut
up into building allotments. Baker, in this crazy
romance, is a middle-aged chairman of directors
of the Antipodean Bank (Lim.), Sydney, with a
bachelor residence at North Shore, where every-
body roams at large. Even the night-watchman
from the bank has the entree to the boss director’s
private house, Australia being a democratic
country. Moreover, the whole board of directors
seem deeply attached to the night-watchman’s
daughter, and one of ’em—the villain—is engaged
to marry her next half-year. Meanwhile, this
chosen director desires the watchman to burgle
the bank’s available assets from the strong-room,
to which scheme the honest old hireling reluctantly
consents, for the sake of his child. He wants to
see her happily married to the wicked director on
the proceeds of the burgle aforesaid. But while
the conspirators are plotting aloud, the dear girl
(Miss Ross) lurks behind a tree, and presently she
upbraids her best director, who causes a snaky
corner of North Shore to crumble beneath her
feet. Luckily, she gets caught in a bush half-way
down the cliff, and managing director Baker saves
Miss Ross’s life, although her memory and her
huge hat have got lost in transit. The burglary
happens a month later. The villain (Styan) gets
all the cash and securities, and the acting-manager
(Albert Norman) is left in the iron safe to perish
until Baker blows it open with a bottle of nitro-
glycerine.
* • * *
When Sydney learns that all the reserve
fund and things were abstracted ere the manager
was put into the safe, there is naturally a furious
run on the Antipodean Bank. The hopes of a
furious run on Bland Holt’s drama are built on
this financial panic. It is a fine stirring crisis.
Director Baker (God bless him !) has a friend
(Bland H.), who found a gold mine for him in
W.A., and the first fruits of this mine (.£100,000)
are due at Redfern Station what time the widow
and the orphan, the selfish grocer, the hairy
agriculturist, and creditors in general, are howling
for their filthy lucre at the bank in George-street.
Baker climbs upon the counter and tells them to
have confidence, and Mrs. Holt, who is a faithful
adherent of the burgled institution, dumps a small
bag of sovereigns into her account, but they
simply devour Mrs. Holt’s little bag of loaves
and fishes, and the panic rages worse than
ever. The villain director proclaims the utter
ruin of the bank, and orders the police to shut the
doors, whereupon Bland Holt and party arrive
from Redfern Station and throw boxes of money
through the plate-glass window. The scene went
vigorously on Saturday, and it can be wrought up
to a high pitch of excitement by careful rehearsal.
There’s a last act to the drama in which Baker
and his banking friends wear military garments
because they are Sydney Lancers, or Parramatta
Rifles. If the scene had been laid in Melbourne
Bland Holt would have sentenced them to appear
barelegged as the local Scottish Volunteers.
Brunton’s views of Sydney Harbor, likewise the
solid interiors and the North Shore land-slip, are
first-class items, and the co. put Australian color
into the acting, anyhow. Baker almost rises to
the occasion, Styan is satisfactory, except for his
awful pot-hat, and Bland Holt makes a laudable
endeavor to look like a bulloeky adventurer from
the Never-Never Wayback. Ten other male
characters come in occasionally, and six ladies do
nothing of much importance. Miss Ross. Mrs.
Bland Holt, and Miss Gill have a good many
lines to speak, and they all look nice as usual ;
also Miss Harrie Ireland is a fine spectacular
Bush Girl, and inasmuch as she swoops down
upon the drama in a pair of boxing-gloves and ties
her glorious hair with a bit of string, Miss I.’s ir-
relevant character is thankfully received. The
four ladies in question are all going to get mar-
ried when the curtain 1 drops. Miss Ross recovers
her memory sufficiently ,to know that she hates
the villain, and the heart of the night-watchman’s
daughter is then freely given to the chairman of
the Hoard.

Next Saturday (August 5) braw M'Adoo,
from Georgia, or thereabouts, makes a reappear-
ance in Melbourne at St. George’s Hall. His
combination of 40 colored singers and cake-
walkers have been heard of from Sydney, and
since St. George’s Hall was brought into notice by
Dante there is no reason why Orpheus M. M'Adoo
shouldn’t open to a crowded house and prosper
exceedingly. The temptation to say that he ought
to M‘Adoo-of-it is not easily resisted,
ifc
‘•A Trip to Chinatown,” which broke out
again at Melb. Princess’s on Saturday, has been
already forgiven by The Bulletin. Viewed in
the light of bygone civilisation, this strange
American entertainment was a thing to weep over,
and many of the ancients of 1890 are said to have
been “ off ” theatres for a whole year after witnes-
sing it ; nevertheless, in the dull, despairing light
of to-day, “ Chinatown ” looks quite respectable.
Melbourne has seen “The American Girl ” and
“The Belle of New York,” not to mention a
lamentable pantomime or two, since Harry Conor
first peeled off his vests and took his temperature
on the Princess’s stage. Circumstances have
paved the way for a more or less successful revival
of “Chinatown.” The success will be probably
rather less than more at the end of three weeks,
but as long as the public continue to vote enthusi-
astically for the present bill, the Higgins who
makes these remarks will keep his Humble Nega-
tive to lumself.
* * * *
The 1899 “ Chinatown” co. consists largely
of the same Conor who was popular in less un-
critical days, and deserves to be rather more
popular now. Welland Strong’s humor shows
sundry subtle improvements, whilst his bald-head
shines out amidst the riot, as of old. Brownlow
the beauteous is a comparatively festive substitute
for one of the heavy young men ; and Miss Carrie
Moore, with her sympathetic voice and general
neatness and despatch, makes a valuable Flirt.
Also Carrie’s slender youthfulness helps to bring
the average age and waist-measurement of the
present female cast nearer to the original figures,
as it were, although the fact remains that
neither of these other ladies possesses a gold front-
tooth. The soprano in the original co. was famous
for a gold tooth. For the rest, the comedian who
dozes on a hot stone, is not exceptionally droll,
and little Willie Grow has little else than little-
ness to fit her for the billet; but the new whistling
waiter will be generally preferred to Alf. Lawton.
Lawton’s was shrill and bony. Whistler Brown
is plump and musical, and he creates a surprising
effect of two Browns whistling a duet. “China-
town,” of course, is staged up to its full worth,
and moves rapidly in the first and third acts.
When the venerable Reuben and Cynthia busi-
ness has been hurried up, and the supply of other
encores is judiciously curtailed, the show will give
no particular cause for weariness. First-night
encores at the Princess’s look very well in the
Monday morning newspapers, but as often as not
they irritate 80 per cent, of the audience.
** * *
A smart turn by Spry and Austin, and the
eternal vivacity of Lottie Moore, and a ballet and
many matters which go to make a full programme
are happening at the Bijou. Richard Douglass is
a new arrival, also Dora Taylor, but the week for
going into details re Rickards’ show is not this
week.

Which remark applies to Scherek’s Orches-
tral Concerts at the Town Hall and to John Fuller’s
Myriorama co. The afternoon Orchestra with
Scherek conducting, and the evening Myriorama,
vocalised by tuneful Fuller and his co., keep the
Town Hall warm every Saturday till further
notice. Trustworthy authorities state that Fuller
in early days was never as robust and sweet a
tenor as he is now, and The Bulletin sees no
grounds for doubting the assertion. He sings like
one who has built up his constitution with sugar,
and his Myriorama is a good, honest shillings-
worth. Last Saturday he caught Scottish volun-
teer sentiment on the hop with “ Glasgow ” and
“Doon the Watter,” and this Saturday he will
balance matters by submitting “ Killarney, ” etc.,
to a Celtic and mixed audience.
Sundry Sydney clergymen have beer
smugly holding forth about recentlv-dead Rober.
Ingersoll’s failure to advance agnosticism ! Well,
lie did fail—in a way most parsons unfortunately
Jail to fail in.
“ Well, now,” said a N.S.W. politician to
his constituents at One Tree Pub., “ I have shown
von clearly how the land lies with regard to
Federation. It isn’t very late yet. Is there any
other question you would like, me to say a few
words about?” The audience muttered to itself
for a few minutes ; then a lanky son-of-the-soil
upreared his six feet of eucalyptus. “Well,
Mister, there is a question we’ve had a bit of talk
about among ourselves lately. Do you think the
British nation is the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel ? ”
And the politician gathered himself together and
spoke for an hour about the Pyramids, tree-and-
serpent worship, and the probable routes of early
Phoenicians voyaging for tin to Cornwall ; and
fogged the audience so satisfactorily that it
cheered him for five minutes and then mobbed the
platform to wring his arm off.

South Australia’s surplus for year ended 30th
June, 1898, is £32,637. This is enough to wipe out the
previous year’s deficit and leave £3965 over.
* * * *
According to the N.S.W. Auditor-General’s re-
port for the year ended June, 1898, the Reid Government
has put up about as bad a record at the Treasury as any
of its predecessors. The A.-G. states that the deficit at
the end of 1891, when Dibbs took office, was £2,557,186,
and that Dibbs left it in 1894 at £2,735,511. This was the
figure at which Reid found it, and at June, 1898, he
had raised it to £2,898,714. Therefore, Dibbs increased
it by £178,325 ; and Iteid further increased it by £163,203.
Bad' as this result is, it would still be a point, in Reid’s
favor that he didn’t go quite so far to the bad as
his predecessor, only that supercilious fat - mail
heaped such scorn on the financiers who went
before him, and bragged with such sickening
persistence that he would never be “associated with a
deficit,” and declared with such brassy cheek that his
deficits were surpluses, that people expected better
things of him. The verdict on Reid, in view of the
Auditor-General’s report, is that he could brag harder
than any other Treasurer, and was less scrupulous than
any other Treasurer, but that he hadn’t a financial virtue
to recommend him.

There is nothing gorgeous about the ’urnhle
balance-sheet of the Australian Joint Stock Bank ; still it
can be said that it is better than its immediate predeces-
sor. And that is about the most lavish praise that can be
safely expended upon it. The half-year’s profits to 30th
June, 1899, are reported as £1358 —equal to 4s. fid. per
cent, per annum on the shareholders’ alleged funds (capi-
tal, £1,168,041 ; reserve, £52,000). Some previous re-
turns compare as follows :

The A.J.S. Bank still says nothing about any writing-
down of capital to provide for losses. If it is assumed
that a bank, when all its assets are written down to their
actual present value (especially a bank which gets its de-
posits at so moderate a rate as the A.J.S. pays), should
earn 2j per cent, on its shareholders’ funds, then, on the
basis of last half-year’s earnings, the A.J.S. needs to
write-off, roughly speaking, 11,111,090 to put it on a
sound basis, and reduce its capital to about £lOO,OOO.
The increase in profits is presumably the result of the
new charge of ss. half-yearly on each current account—a
source of income which is proving a blessing to many
hampered institutions.
During the half-year the A.J.S. Bank’s note-
circulation has diminished by £18,400 ; advances have
increased by £197,000 ; cash and liquid securities have
diminished by £362,000 ; and deposits have gone down by
£161,000. The supply of information ends about there.
The A.J.S. lumps old reconstructed A and B deposits and
new deposits together, so it doesn’t appear whether the
new deposits are increasing (through people recovering
confidence in the bank) or diminishing (through people
losing confidence in the hank). It is known that, during
the half-year, some more of the reconstructed deposits
(amount uncertain) have been bought up at a discount of
an uncertain quantity in the £, and that a considerable
but uncertain profit has been made on the deal. The
profit in question doesn’t appear anywhere in the balance-
sheet, nor is it stated what becomes of it. If it is
included among the earnings, and even then the result is
only a visible balance to the good of £1358, the condition
of things must be something unspeakable, but a vague
impression prevails that, the profit made by the repur-
chase of deposits at a discount goes to write off deprecia-
tion. Still, there is absolutely no evidence either way.
Tho biggest asset of the A.J.S. Bank is “bills
receivable, bills discounted, and all other debts due to
the bank and other assets at old valuation's, £6,848,928.”
It would be impossible to give much less information than
that. The state of the profit account, the selling price of
shares, and the knowledge which everyone possesses of
thecollapse in “ old valuations,” are sufficient evidence
that this big asset is, in part, only a paper pretence and
no real asset at all. Presumably the management has
some idea as to how far it is only a pretence and how far
it is real, but it keeps the information very successfully to
itself. The saving clause about “old valuations” is, in
itself, a tolerably straight admission that the A.J.S. Bank
is putting before its shareholders a statement which does
not show how its accounts stand, and a balance-sheet
which, so far as showing the real position of the bank, is
no balance-sheet at all. And there is no law in N.S.W. to
make it present a balance-sheet which will show how it
actually stands.
* * * *
The Ballarat Banking Co. (of Ballarat, Vic-
toria) shows a further improvement, profits for the half-
year to 30th June, 1899, being £3o22—equal to £4 6s. Bd.
percent, per annum on the shareholders' funds (paid-up
capital, £85,000 ; reserve, £54,5U0 ; total, £139,500). Some
former profits
December, 1894 .. £3,710 June, 1897 .. £2,881

June, 1396 .. 3.250 December, 1898 .. 2,906
December, 1896 .. 2,936 June, 1899 .. 3,022
The half-year just finished is thus the best which the
Ballarat Banking Co. has met with for three years. The
regular 5.4 per cent, dividend is paid, absorbing
£2337 ; the reserve fund is increased by £5OO,
making it £55,000; and the other £lB5, added
to previous balance, makes £2464 to carry for-
ward. Things generally look well with this old-estab-
lished and steady-going little bank—it is now 34 years of
age. Deposits show an increase, and the reserve of cash
and liquid securities ('67,124) is equal to 31 percent, of
all liabilities to the public. Indeed, it is something of a
mystery why the Ballarat Banking Co., with its compara-
tively small liabilities, should want to k'eep so much cash
on hand.
The steady improvement in the profits of the
Ausiralian Deposit and Mortgage Bank hasn’t gone on
quite so well of late, the earnings for the six months to
30th June, 1899, being only, £1257. This compares with
some previous half-years, good, bad and indifferent, after
this fashion : _ ■,

Doss June, 1897 .. .. 911

December, 1595 .. 2016 December, 1893 .. 1400
Profit June, 1899 .. .. 1257
June, 1896 .. .. J 69
The profit is equal to ss. 7d. per cent., per annum on the
shareholders’ funds, and as the A. D. and M. Bank long
since got out of the dissipated habit of paying dividends,
the profit balance is now raised to £OBO5.
The results, however, are not so bad, considering
all the circumstances of the case. The Australian
Deposit and Mortgage Bank reconstructed for the
second time in 1895. It arianged to renew 70 per cent, of
its deposits at 3£ per cent., till 1910. The other 30 per
cent, bore no interest, and were repayable by three instal-
ments in 1896, 1899, and 1901. So the average rate of in-
terest which the bank has to pay for its deposits grows
larger as the non-interest-bearing deposits are paid off.
It was £2 9s. per cent, before the first payment was made.
It was then £2 14s. 6d. per cent. Now that the second
payment has been made, the balance of the deposits cost
£3 Is. 3<l. per cent., and, after 1901, the rate will be £3los.
per cent. The payments now being made are reducing
the amount of profit-earning funds, without reducing the
interest burden, and, under these conditions, the A.D.
and M. is holding its own reasonably well. Dur-
ing the past six months the amount owing to
the reconstructed depositors has been reduced from
£546,712 to £481,510. Other liabilities, apart from de-
posits, have been reduced slightly, and now stand at only
£13,000. The new current-account business has improved
somewhat. The bank has £36.815 in cash and £1,370,000
in various more-or-less realisable securities, mostly mort-
gages, which yield about £1 12s. per cent, per annum all
round at present, but which will probably be worth more
some day. As the institution can pay its wav and hasn’t
to meet the bulk of its deposits till 1910, it can afford to
sit peacefully on these securities and keep them warm,
and, if it sits on them long enough, many good things
may happen. If it had to realise in a hurry, however, the
results would probably be very bad indeed. They are not
the kind of securities to stand being hustled. As for the
dissipated habit of paying dividends, the A. D. and M.
isn’t likely to give wa.v'to that for many years yet.

Under its new policy of State audit and partial
State supervision the Queensland National Bank —which
private management made almost the boss financial honor
of Australia—looks a little better every succeeding half-
year. The results during the two years of State super-
vision have been :
Transferred to

Profit. Account. Profit.
December, 1897 .. £10,635 £8,635 £B,UUO

June, 1899 .. -. 23,879 13,879 10,u00
£79,564 £43,504 £36,000
The improvement is even greater than it looks, for in
each case amounts recovered on account of debts written
off as bad under the old management have been included.
Leaving these out the actual profit for the last three half-
June, een ' .. £12,801 I June, 1899 .. .. £20,787
December, IS9B .. 16,213 |
The 113,879 transferred to contingency account is some
more provision towards the losses which were not fully
covered at the writing-down of 1897. liow much these
amount to, and how long they will continue to swallow
up the profits, are matters of uncertainty, for the final
cleaning-up is necessarily a gradual process. Of the
other £10,900 (»qual to £4 15s. sd. per cent, per annum
on shareholders’ funds), 12500 goes to pay off the debt to
the Queensland Government, £5OOO to reduce the debt to
private depositors, and £2500 to reserve-fund, making it
£9OOO.
The Queensland National Bank is thus £23,879
nearer to making its assets and liabilities balance than it
was six months ago, though it is still a dreadfully long
way off that desirable state of solvency. The situation,
as near as it is possible to estimate, is something like
this:—
Liabilities. Assets.
Capital .. .. £412,644 Cash, advances
Reserve Fund .. 9,000 and other as-
Bills, notes, &c.. 512,616 sets and al-
Govt. Deposits.. 2,156,253 | ieged assets £6,686,343
Private ~ .. 5,062,285 I Deficit (say) .. 1,460,455
£8,152,798 | £8,152,798
The deficit in question is the amount (ss. in the £) which
was professedly written off deposits in 1897 to square the
accounts, and which was partly taken out of the balance-
sheet (so far as private depositors were concerned) and
partly left in (so far as the Govt, account was concerned).
As these amounts have to be paid out of profits, they
still remain a liability, and the above £1,460,455, or
something very near it, is really and truly the
Q.N. Bank’s visible shortage. Also, there is another
shortage (amount unknown, though something like
£380,000 has been suggested), being depreciation of the
£6,686,343 of assets mentioned above, which was not
adequately provided for in I he second reconstruction, and
it is towards this that the £43,564 carried to contingency
account during the last two years is applied. On a rough
estimate the Q.N.B.’s total deficit may be £1,830,000
or so, and it is being written off out of profits just now
at the rate of rather over £40,000 a year, at which pace
the trouble will be over in 45 years if there is no new
crisis in the interval. But there probably will be one.
Anyhow, it would be a vast amount more sensible and
more honest if the balance-sheet showed among liabilities
the whole 20s. in the £ due to private depositors-it
shows the whole 20s. in the £ due on Government de-
posits, and only 15s. in the £ of the money due on pri-
vate deposits—and the shortage was put boldly and
clearly among the assets, with a statement of the amount
written off it each half-year. It would also save much
weary conjecture, and mu h foolish burying of the
ostrich's head in the sand. The r-tate auditor should at
least furnish a complete balance-sheet. It isn’t any busi-
ness of his to conceal the awfulness of the old private
management.

The Wilfley concentrator has only been a short
time before the mining public, but has already demon-
strated its superiority, over 1200 being sold within the
past two years. This machine has a capacity of from
25 to 30 tons per day, and will save more sulphuretts,
float gold, amalgam or quicksilver, and make a cleaner
and better separation than any belt concentrator made.
It can he easily and rapidly adjusted while in motion, and
requires no expert attention. The Austral Otis Engineer-
ing Coy., South Melb, have been appointed sole manufac-
turing agents, and are now engaged constructing machines
for the colonies. The price of the machine is £ll5.

The Civil Service Mutual Building and Invest-
ment Co. (Sydney) reports a profit of £462 for the year
ended 30th June, 1899. This compares with some pre-
vious profits as follows:

The C.S. 'Building Society has a curious device of missing
one half-year’s dividend ; it pays a half-year’s dividend at
5 per cent, once a year instead of paying a whole year’s
dividend at 2\4 per cent, once a year. This harmless
little vanity enables it to fancy that it is a 5 per cent,
concern when it isn’t. The co. has £15,171 paid up capi-
tal, 1:1313 contingency fund, £lOOO reserve fund, and
£ll2 protit and loss balance. The great trouble is that it
is too small to be profitable ; expenses are kept very low,
and yet they absorb more than half the profits. The
earnings are not 3 per cent, on the shareholders capital,
so it would be more profitable and a good deal safer and
much less worry to put the State securities.
Mephan Ferguson, engineer, boiler-maker, etc.,
of Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth, has just secured a
contract for the manufacture and supply of all the bolts,
nuts and washers which may be required by the Victorian
railways during the next three years. He has also con-
tracted to supply all the carbonic acid gas necessary for
working the railway refrigerating and ice-making plant
this is one of I. and E. Hall’s patent carbonic anhydride-
machines, the same system as has been adopted by the
Govts, of South Australia, Queensland, and Western Aus-
tralia. Mr. Ferguson has a large stock of these machines
(suitable for meat preserving co.’s dairies, butchers, and
others) on hand at present, which he is selling at greatly-
reduced prices.*
* * * *
B.H. Pr op. gives about a quarter the informa-
tion that it used to in its half-yearly reports ; yet there is
still good picking in them. Here, for example, are some
figures built up from the balance-sheet to May 31. The
total value of the various plants which the mine has had
is £975,000 : of this £644,000 ha been written off. The
B.H. smelting plants cost £116,571 ; they are now valued,
what is left of them, at £8073. Most of these plants have
been removed to Pt. Pirie ; and presutnabl3 r the value is
included in the item, “ Pirie smelting plant,” £88,360.
The sum mentioned does not therefore quite represent
the full value of the new plants. Other items tell elo-
quent tales of the heavy price which the big co. has paid
for its experience. The amalgamating plant, which (lid
less than a year’s steady work, ran into £39,880; it has
“ depreciated ”to £3370. The same thing happened in
connection with the earlier concentrating mills. Other
balance-sheet items: Reserve fund investments, £125,000
(at which they have stood for a long while now) ; pro-
ducts in transit, £101,716; products on hand, t 262,989.
If the co. were wound up to-morrow it reckons it would
be 440,802 to the good, without the mine and plant.
* • * *
The B.H. Prop. Co. has again paid away more
than its net profits. It paid 3s. per share (£144,000) in the
half-vear to Nov. last, and earned £122,151 ; it brought
down the divs. to 2s. 6d. last half (£120,000), and earned
£107,563. The co. has now 11 furnaces of 120 tons each,
and two of 80 tons each (a furnace’s tonnage is its daily
capacitv under certain standard conditions), which is
greater than any other co’s in the world, and far greater
than this co. ever had before. Formerly with these
furnaces it could have treated 300,00!) tons of its
oxidised ores in a half-year; now it cannot treat
more than 105,000 tons. The concentration of the
sulphides renders them smeitable; but the process
is very slow. This is due largely to the presence
of zinc, which cannot he wholly eliminated ; but it is also
due in some degree to the extreme fineness of the con-
centrated material —the fire does not get a chance in the
caking mass. Besides, the fluxing free lead ores are also
fine now. It is believed that the briquetting plant will
overcome this difficulty in a small degree ; but slow work
will still be unavoidable. The improvement may, how-
ever, allow the present 2s. 6d. per quarter div. to be con-
tinued. The larger concentrating-plant will presumably
he us»d to turn out more concentrates in order to ease off
the demand upon the fluxing oxidised ores ; so that
will not make much difference to profits. It would, in
fact, lessen them if it were not pretty certain that the
new plant will do cheaper and better woik than even th€
section already moving ; and that shows a big improve-
ment on everything that was done down to six months
ago.
Tn spite of its recent enormous expenditure on
new ore-reducing plant the B.H. Prop, does not extract
as much ore as it did before it began to handle sulphides.
In the half-year of ’96 corresponding to the one just
closed sulphides were only being nibbled at ; the total
out-turn was 230,451 tons, of which all but a few tons
was oxidised ore. The profit was £281,735. Last half-
year, with much heavier plant, 202,693 tons ore was
handled, of which 108,693 tons were sulphides ; the profit
(gross) was £139,164. What it is most important to
remember is'that every ton of oxidised ore broken was a
ton of ore to be sent to the smelters ; now every ton of
sulphides broken means only one-fourth of a ton of con-
centrates to be sent to the furnaces, where, moreover,
they can be dealt wdth only at a far greater ex-
pense per ton than was the case with oxidised ores.
No wonder, therefore, divs. have toppled, and the
managers spend anxious days planning economies. And
thev have done much in that way, as workmen very well
know. In six months of ’9l, 129,589 tons of ore, mostly
fairly soft, was raised and smelted for £195,500; in the
half-year just past, 202,693 tons of far harder ore, besides
98,302 cubic vds. of waste, was mined, much of it concen-
trated and roasted, and the whole of the product smelted
for within a few pounds of the same total. Out of the
127,589 tons, bv the wav, the shareholders made £672,124
profit ; out of the 202,693 tons—well, not enough to pay
divs. amounting to £120,000.

Booth’s United Gold Mines is aptly described
by the British Australasian as “a promising N.S.W.
concern.” Its special commissioner has had an interview
with one of the directors. Curiously enough, the direc-
tor’s name is not given. A great yarn of the richness of
the mine is accompanied by pictures and fills 2pp.
Mine just listed on London Exchange ; capital,
only £240,tX)0. Dealings said to have taken place at
about £2, and the fascination of a 100 per cent, premium
is the reason given for saying something about, the show.
Situation—Coolac, near Gundagai. Nine shafts sunk,
proving one block to contain 1,250,000 tons ore, which can
be mined as a quarry at 12s. per ton. “ The entire hill,
in fact, is a mass of gold-bearing rock.” Value of ore,
from Ito 6oz. In one place the lode is 7ft. wide, with no
walls; at another 12ft., with no walls; and at a third
30ft., and still no walls. Ore goes as low as sdwt. to loz.
in rmniense quantities, but No. 1 shaft shows from loz. to
6oz. per ton. “ Our engineers tell us that if we mix the
ore from the hill with the rich ore from the main shaft,
the whole proposition will average loz. per ton. The
value of the 1,250,000 tons already exposed is thus
£5,000,000. Working costs £1 per ton, and “ thus our co.
has an asset worth £4,000,000 sterling. The capital being
only £240,000, the shares on this estimate work out at
nearly £l6 per share.” Calculated only on ioz. per
ton, as this modest director prefers to do until the
crushings prove the higher return, the shares should be
worth £8 each ! All these modest figures are based
on the assumption that the ore will only last 100 ft.
in depth, but. it is anticipated that the hill will prove to be
a mass of gold-bearing rock, in which case the amount of
ore available will be stupendous. Mine equipped with a
40-head-stamp mill, shut dowm for want of water. In-
tended gradually to increase to 100 stamps : and this re-
tiring, unknown, unnamed director sees no reason why
they shouldn’t run 300 stamps like the Simmer and Jack on
the Rand. He does not anticipate any considerable ad-
vance in the price of shares for some months—on which
point writer fully agrees with him. Tell us—How many
people are there in N.S.W. aware of the existence of such
a gorgeous mine ? We have seen assays published from
Booth’s United during the last two years, but have never
heard of a crushing. There is plenty of water there now.
At any rate, £480,000 seems fair value for a mine that
never crushed a ton of ore. After the failure of the Gal-
lvmont, the Gibraltar disappointment, the bottom falling
out of the Wentworth mines, the sudden ending of Tay-
lor’s Reward, and the ignominious fate of half-a-dozen
other N.S.W. gold-mines, owned in London.it will take
something more than the publication of assays and the
“jabber” of anonymous directors to increase its value
beyond the £480,000.

The dredging-boom has reached Port Darwin ;
will no doubt make its way across to Papua and Thursday
Island, coming round by way of Westralia. It would be a
joke to start a Coolgardie River dredging scheme. Like
most other booms, it was long incubating and then came
with a mighty rush. Bucket river-dredging has been going
on in Maoriland for the hist 12 years, but we have heard
more about it in the last year than in all the previous 11.
“Johnny” Wallace has been working his centrifugal-
pump system at Yackandandah over 10 years, and has had
a number of dredges working for several years past.
The writer ascribes the dredging-boominnosmall
degree to a remark alleged to have been made last year
byWallace—that he made over £20,000 profit in one year
from one of his dredging claims—the Staghorn. Did he
really say it, and, more important still, did he mean it ?
Whether or not, he could just as truly have said that he
spent over t 50,000 at Yackandandah before he received
that. £20,000. Bucket-diedging in new countries mustneces-
sarily encounter new difficulties, as .speculators in N.S.W.
and Vic. will discover to their cost ere long. Perfection
in Maoriland is the outcome of 10 years’ experience and
experiments to reduce cost and remove difficulties. Ex-
cept on one or two rivers—the Clarence, for instance —the
conditions are entirely different in N.S.W. and Vic., and,
in a great, number of cases, the deposition of tailings will
be so tough a job as to utterly knock out the business.
* * • •
The N.S.W. dredging-boom intensifies. Half-
a-dozen co’s launched last week in Sydney with the
alleged object of building dredges, anil all the shares
allotted before the poor public get a look-in. They, of
course, are expected to come in afterwards—at big pre-
miums, every opportunity being given in that direction.
A good time is here for promoters, brokers, and boom-
sters generallj'. Dredging is a really excellent industry
if conducted with discrimination and the judgment ordi-
narily applied to any other enterprise. Failure iri the
main is, however, a certainty on account of the way
people are going about it. Up to date no yields—in fact,
next to no tests. The game is to peg-out some old,
worked alluvial flat; more fashionable still is it to peg
out miles of a river, no time being given for tests. In
nine cases out of ten no lease is issued, but only a pro-
spectus. Some expert or ottier reports that the river or
flat is suitable for the business, and the public are asked
to wade in. It isn’t customary to require cash—this is
put forward as a redeeming recommendation—the pro-
moters (who take no risk) are satisfied with half the con-
cern in paid-up shares. The game is breaking down by
its own weight.
A reasonable assumption is that 100 schemes are
incubating in N.S.W. Of course, the promoters will not
wait for the building of the dredges ere they launch their
paid-up scrip on to lhe market. Not a word is said about
the difficulties already besetting one well-advanced
scheme, and the troubles that are bound to surround
many others. It is more than probable that when some
of them get to work in the narrow streams of N.S.W. it
will lie expensive, if not impossible, to prevent the
buckets bringing up the same wash over and over again.
Writer has often been struck, on walking into any Sydney
or Melbourne legal-man!’'"'-’s office, by the brass list of
dead co.’s on or near bis r and the long-disused seals
in his office. That forecasts the fate of at least 9-10ths of
the N.S.W. dredging schemes. A few will survive, no
doubt. The great majority will be as dead as Julius
Ciesar this day twelvemonth. In some cases companies
have been floated before the leases are issued, and it is
apparent that it is impossible for the Mines Department
to grant them without fatal injury to leases already
granted further down stream. In others, irreparable
injury will be done to the stream by the enormous quan-
tity of tailings deposited therein and to the surrounding
country. Never before in the history of the Mines and
Lands Department has so serious a question arisen.

Sydney E. News on the Turon dredge : “Some
absurd stories have come to hand with reference to nug-
gets being found, but vve find on inquiry at head-quarters
f* that as a matter of fact heavy gold such as that described
' ■ could only be saved on the ripples, and this part of the
• machinery has not been cleaned up since thej’ were put
in.” What a humorist! Such are the things that the
N.S.W. dredging-boom is being made of.
* * * •
Dear Bulletin. —About this dredging bubble. Turon
working eight weeks, tuning up three weekspreviously,and
now wants tuningup again. Visitors gone to see, returned
to-day crestfallen ; yet there is to be a new issue of £6OOO
for a new dredge ! Were the visitors told that Chinamen
scraped the bottom of the Turon 20 times over for every
speck of gold there ? * Mining boom ’—indeed ! Take the
Shoalhaven. In 25 years, 42 companies and syndicates
exploited there, and not one of them pa : d the carriage-
expqnses of the promoters. It is not a gold-bearing coun-
try. No gold in its banks to pay for working, and, as for
the river, the bottom all along is too rocky—take more to
quarry out the rocks than the expected gold would
pay for ; where rocks are not, it is so shallow that you
can walk across—and no dredge could float or work
there. Then take Araluen. Yes, gold used to be there.
So used Chinamen —they scraped there for 50 years, and
are scraping there still. Dredgers can scrape after them,
and get precious little. Something certainly may be left
for a dredge in Araluen, but there is nothing to even buy
tobacco with in the Shoalhaven.— H. Weight.
In the advertising columns of this issue will be
found the prospectus of the Colombo Dredging- Co.,
which has acquired an area of 96 acres on the Shoalhaven
River near Braidvvood (N.S.W.). It is in 30,000 shares of
10s. each (the vendors, who apparently vend nothing hut
the idea and the lease, are to get 3000 of these fully paid,
end 10,000 more fully paid when the dredge is at work),
and the promoters think they see their way to paying Bs.
per share per annum in dividends. It is to be hoped they
will.

The Wilgena (S. A.) syndicates have nearly all
expired, but Worturpa, where tellurides are alleged to
exist, awaits the test of development, and, as Boulder
magnate Brookman and other Westralianaires are putting
a few hundreds into the field, there is some prospect of
finding a payable mine—an experience which, so far, S.A.
has never had.

Just when the Referendum fight was on

was considering designs for a gorgeous new
J ) t a / lller - ; One design in particular pleased the
< ( b° sses >” but unfortunately it bore the motto,
lor Home and Commonwealth.” “Home and
Commonwealth ! ” exclaimed one leader ; “ that
means Britain and this blasted bill !’’ Whereat
there were groans. Of course it didn’t mean any-
thing of the sort; it just meant that that parti-
cular union was for the member’s home and for
the State—for the individual and the general
good. Still they decided to accept the design,
with this amendment of the motto: “For Home
and the Colonies /” And with that idiotic legend
it has gone to the painter’s. Who can wonder at
the disruption of that Labor-party?

Many of Hobart’s old cemeteries (now

way) possess some really fine tombstones. The
second-hand dealer has recently been at work,
and, by getting permission from an impecunious
relative of the long-since defunct, and all who are
living of the cemetery trustees, saw a .£4O profit
sticking out. Almost the whole of the monument
had been removed, and the name-plate rubbed
out, when an interfering oldest inhabitant gave
the al.irm. Then it was discovered that the im-
pecunious relative had no legal authority to dis-

The saintly deacon M‘Turk, wielder of the

himself open to base insinuations by a very
little oversight. M'Turk returned home late
from a pious festivity with his wife, and was
compelled by unforeseen circumstances to
climb in through the front window to
open the door. He took off his sacred
bell topper, and placed it on the
floor of the verandah beside his
paunchy, familiar brolly, ere under-
taking the task. Then he forgot
all about hat, brolly, and open
window, and went to bed. Next
morning people passing saw these
things, and flew to scandalous con-
clusions. Rumor fled in all direc-
tions, and when the great and good
MMurk came forth in conscious
rectitude, he discovered a jeering,
ribald crowd at his front fence, and
the gingham, the immaculate hat,
and the open window in suggestive
juxtaposition. People were even
ostentatiously smelling the hat for
fumes of drink. M'Turk is still ex-

The report that Yic. Commandant Holled-
Smith aspires to the Chief Commissionership of
Police bodes no good to the force. In England it
is common enough to give such posts to military
men, but there they have neither the official power
nor the social influence which they possess in Aus-
tralia, nor are the police regarded as a military
force. No British policeman would call the
general public “civilians ” as the Australian trap
does. In fact, the very essence of being' a good
policeman is to be a good citizen. A very good
soldier may make a very bad policeman, and vice
versa. The obedience and steadiness required in
the one do not necessarily imply the discretion and
good temper necessary for the other, and the
military element is responsible for much of the
police blundering characteristic of Australia.
Some practical experience of the beauties
of police-identification methods :
Ed. Bulletin.— Be the man Holt, lately un-gaoled as
wrongly-convicted. I was also arrested in Adelaide, and,
without being told what for, was placed in a row of other
men for “ identification.” It was under gaslight, but in
a shadowy place stood, with a policeman, a man whom
I subsequently found had been assaulted and robbed a
couple of days before, and I distinctly heard the police-
man indicate me as the man to be spotted. The man
accordingly positively identified me as one of the men
who garrotted him. Next morning I was called out
along with Holt and others, and three more prosecutors
were produced to identify their respective assailants.
One lady witness, on having looked carefully at each of
us, exclaimed, “ No, the man is not there,” whereupon
one of the detectives directed her attention specially to
Holt and myself, and pointedly asked her to make very
sure. (My prosecutor afterwards withdrew his identifica-
tion, much to the disgust of the police.)— Victim

A wedding at Hongkong, in June last, and

two women, one Scotch and the other Irish. For
some act of disobedience the captain threatened

A certain N.S.W. country official is a
dapper little oliap with a hot temper and a
glass eye, and, coming to high words, the other
evening, with a “ commercial ” at the hotel, he
whipped out his glass eye, placed it on the mantel-
piece, doffed his coat, and invited the bagman
“ outside.” “ Right you are,” said the drummer ;
“but let us start level !” And, taking off a head
of hair that rivalled Paderewski’s, he placed it
alongside the glass eye. It was too funny; and,
after a roar of laughter, they resumed eye and
wig, and filled ’em up again.

The Archbishop of Sydney recently pre-
sided over a conference upon “matrimonial
agencies.” More “Secret Conference!” Also,
more trades-unionism.
* * * *
A few years back a N.S.W. resident cut
his wife’s throat. The children were upstairs in
bed and the parents were sitting quietly
down-stairs when the father
suddenly rose and pro-
ceeded to hack at
his wife with a
razor. He then
calmly proceeded
to the police sta-
tion and announced
his crime. The hor-
rified officers rushed
to the woman’s assist-
ance, just in time to
save her from bleeding
lo death. The man was
clearly insane and was
committed to an asylum.
His wife admitted that she
had been in dread of her
husband for some time.
Though in good employment he
was always haunted by the fear
that some day his children
would be in want and that he
would not be able to keep a
roof over their heads. They
were a devoted couple, and im-
mediately on her recovery
the woman began agitating
for her man’s release, which
was granted last January. The
doctors’ opinion of the case was
that the poor man had returned
to his senses, but his life hung on a
thread owing to his terrible re-
morse. His only chance was in
returning to his wife, and
they recommended his dis-
charge conditionally upon
her undertaking the risk
of living with him again.
The Chief Secretary was also to ap-
prove of a moderate allowance being
granted to the family, for it was
thought that if the husband knew that
there was always something between
his children and starvation, his chance
of ultimate thorough recovery would
be much improved. The experiment
is being watched with interest.

Dear Bulletin. —Re priests in
Philippines (B. 24/6/’99). You are wrong
in saying that the natives look upon in-
fusion of white blood as an improve-
ment. Natives and whites alike look
down upon the Srrani (Eurasian), and
though a native girl falls readily to a
white man, the resultant half-caste pro-
geny arrive most unwelcomely.— Yang A.

Victorian Justice Williams preaches one
thing and practises another. About a year ago
he delivered a dreary sermon in the Australian
Church on the Criminal Law. Like most of his
non-judicia.l utterances, it consisted largely of
innuendoes directed at his chief, but for the rest
he spoke out strongly against long terms of soli-
tary confinement. One of his remarks was to the
effect that any judge who gave men long and fre-
quent terms of solitary confinement should be
forced to undergo a period of that particular kind
of punishment himself. Also he deplored the
want of uniformity among sentences imposed for
similar offences by different judges. That sounded
all very well from the pulpit of the Australian
Church, but what does this self-labelled humane
judge do when he sits on the bench to sentence
prisoners? During July criminal sittings he gave
one prisoner 90 days’ solitary in the last 18 months
of an 8 years’ sentence ! To another he dealt out
28 days’ solitary in two years, and even in a sen-
tence of six months he gave 12 days’ solitary.
Then, in regard to uniformity of sentences: he
sentenced a man who had pleaded guilty to fowl-
stealing, to two months on each of three charges
in respect to crimes committed at one and the
same time, with a period of solitary confinement.
This was after he had harangued the unfortunate
man for several minutes, during which he in-
formed him that he had been found guilty of a
similar offence at the previous General Sessions,
and sentenced, by another judge, to six months.
That, he said, was a very severe sentence for such
a comparatively small offence, and one which ha
would not have thought of giving him had he
been the judge.

Women of the “ unfortunate class ” re-
cently complained to the Bendigo (V ic.) police
that little girls were competing with them, and
lowering the wages of shame in the local
Chinese camp. Enquiry disclosed that the
mother of one child disposed of her daughter to
a Chinese rag merchant for the price of a jam-
boree. It was further elicited that this orna-
ment of her sex was in the habit of
“harboring children,” which means a lot.
Another juvenile Flossie, “rescued” six months
ago, had succumbed again to Mongolian blandish-
ments. She and the other girl before the court
had, in three instances known to the police, in-
duced other little girls to visit the camp and be
“ initiated.” Australia is the country which sends
missionaries to China.

“ Speculum,” to The Bulletin
“Pu.vyaka” (B. 8/7/’99) dogmatises cheerfully. “The
hair-loving female is either a morbid product ora homo-
pithecal reversion.” Might as well say that the smooth-
man-preferring woman is a reversion to the still more
ancestral fish ! Also, the chances are that the average
woman prefers the average man, who is neither too much
Esau nor too much Jacob—a notion which is quite com-
patible with the assumption that if, through causes other
than sexual selection, the a.m. shall become less and less
hirsute, the a.w. will still continue to prefer him. As for
the respective strengths of hirsute men and smooth, such
cases as Sandow’s prove little. Sandow, according to him-
self, was rather a puny youth, and has only reached his pre-
sen t magnificent development by most carefully-regulated
exercises. But he is not a normal man ; he is an artificial
product, whose progeny (if any) will probably (like that
of most other manufactured athletes) he insignificant
physically as well as intellectually. Nature will, in the
m iss, permit only of the norm, and every temporary de-
parture therefrom contains within itself the seeds of re-
version thereto. And the norm, as regards human
strength, is, I take it, the hirsute man whom Sandow
himself acknowledges to be stronger, to begin with, than
the smooth man who is susceptible of a higher degree of
athletic manufacture. Apropos: I have taken much
physiological interest in athletics, and have known many
men, whose brawn was their profession, get into street
rows, but I have never known one who couldn’t be effec-
tively handled by the common, flat-footed policeman,
with just his normal uncultivated muscles to help him.
[Yet the policeman isn’t uncultivated ; he is a trained
athlete, in most British-language countries at least.—

More about hair :
Dear Bulletin.—“ Puyyaka” (B. 8/7/’99) says: “Hair,
as an indication of strength, is a fraud. Consumptives
often become magnificently hairy, and the hirsute growth
over diseased localities in the body is well known.” Just
so. But unless that also proves (which it doesn’t) that
the smooth skin denotes the stronger constitution, it is
worthless as an argument, however apparent as a fact.
Further, hair often falls out as the result of disease.
Writer’s head resembled a billiard-ball after an attack of
pleuritis. Also, smooth skin is remarkable as a con-
comitant of physical weakness. Moreover, there is an
aspect of this question which will make “ Puyyaka ” rub
his (possibly smooth) chin and think hard. Are the
hirsute Scandinavian, the huge-moustached Montenegrin,
the full-bearded Briton and German, lower types than the
smoothskinned Chow and the beardless nigger? And,
finally, if the hair-loving female is “either a morbid
product or a homopithecal reversion,’’ there must be a
lot of her, and prolific at that, because the hairy man
occurs as often as the other fellow, up to date. —Ben Sun

Wanted : An artistic conscience. An ex-
cellent chance of giving' some good local artist a
commission, has just been lost by Vic. Govern-
ment. A fine, new cement bridge over the Yarra,
connecting South Yarra with Richmond, is just
finished. The sides of it wanted decorating. So
the dull, unimaginative Public Works Department
imported 12 hideous plaster griffins, all precisely
alike, and has stuck them on the bridge, six on
each side. They are ugly, poor, miserable beasts.
An artist like Longstaff, with
his fine eye for the grotesque,
would have done the de-
partment a set of designs
which would have made
the bridge worth looking
at. But these cheap and
nasty stucco monstrosities
are a discredit to Mel-
bourne. It is so like a
Government Department
to get a dozen things
all precisely alike and
stick them up with
mortar.

From Shanghai to The Bulletin :
A word re missionaries, male and female. Last week I
saw that the inland missions of this country, run by the
Methodists and Church of England, received from Aus-
tralia the sura of £3016 for 1896. This does not include
the other churches who collect in Australia “ for the
heathen and our dear brethren laboring in China.” Dur-
ing a recent raining expedition up the Yangtsze Valley, I
found a mission-station near a place called Woolwo, 60
miles west of Nanking. Here there are two white males
and two white females living Chinese-fashion among the
people. They are unmarried, and wear native clothing,
the men having real pigtails. They report three converts
to Christianity last year, and two of those are mission
servants ! Our party of three white men wished accom-
modation, but were refused. We, however, found fair
“diggings” with some Buddhist priests in a temple
pitched on the summit of a 500 ft. hill close by. The
heathen were kind and hospitable, and since that date
we have found that “ the Joss-house” is the best place in
the land to camp in when it is too wet to pitch a tent.
All experienced travellers here give missions a wide berth
just because accommodation is refused nine times out of
ten, and, secondly, because the parsons are so inquisitive.
In one mission where we did succeed in finding lodgings
we found that the Chinese had made much more impres-
sion on the seven inmates than the latter had made upon
the thousands of natives outside. All the household,
three men and four women, dressed in Chinese style, and
never by any chance did anything for themselves that
could be done for them by Chinese servants. The house-
hold is presided over by an elderly New Englander, his
wife being second in command. Two Chicago men and
three young girls complete the show. We retired early
that night, and rising at daybreak, did some prospecting
in the vicinity. Returning at 11 a.m. we found no one
astir except the servants, and from them learned that
“ the Kweitya” (foreign devils) never rose before noon —a
well-established Mandarin custom. This mission returned
“18 converts to Christ ” as the result of last year’s
labors, and apparently they are all employed at the es
tablishment.

It is encouraging to notice in a rpcent number
of Pbarson's Wkkki.v, that the public in Kurland

“ Albatross Lamp Wick.” They endorse all that is claimed

The trend of fashion for the past few years has
been along a course of unusual brilliancy, and for the
season just opening, if one may judge by what prevails at
home, that vain goddess who presides over our fashions
will dispense styles with a lavishness and perfection
worthy of the federal year. Our leading fashionable
drapers are, of course, on the qui vive with plans for
dealing with every variation of style ; but our best infor-
mation, from a well-informed source, hints that the most
magnificent costumes, mantles, blouses, &c., are to be
seen at the well-known Melbourne firm’s, Messrs. Stainer
and Co.’s, Swanston-street, who have this season had the
extraordinary advantage of a special personal selection,
extending over all the noted spheres of refined fashion at

them, as “ a revelation.”*

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, August 1, 1599.
Mr Dear Myee,—
All very well to sneer at the thought of asking
800 guests to play on your staircase, as the
Equitable Life Assurance Society did on its 40th
birthday, but that style of entertainment has its
good points. For once, every woman was seen
at her best. In a ball-room, a well-dressed
woman gets lost in a crowd of other well-dressed
women. She looks charming in her bed-room,
before she leaves home, when the family gathers
round and says “ How lovely !” Then she goes
to the function, and gets swallowed up, crushed,
robbed of her identity, as it were, in a crowd of
other identities. But on a staircase all is different.
You see a petite creature in white gauze sweeping
down the wide stairs, and her beauty gets a chance
to smite you. In a ball-room she would be un-
noticed. On the staircase she moves apart from
her surroundings, and frock and face have full
play. After that, you may be surprised to hear
that one never saw so many pretty women at a
Sydney show before.
The Equitable broke out brilliantly at this
party. Mr. Carlisle Taylor, Mr. D’Arcy Irvine,
and others received their guests on the entrance-
steps ; which isn’t a too highly successful way of
welcoming people. Women in goloshes and
ballooned-out overcloaks over a turned-up skirt,
want to dash madly straight into the dressing-
room. A lighted portico is always a trial to a
wrapped-up woman on a wet night. She who can
stop calmly and shake hands, and send up a sweet
smile from under a forbidding headgear of wet
black net, is quite a heroine. The feminine part
of. the 800 guests rushed past the hosts, looking
the other way.
His Ex. and Lady Mary Lygon arrived at half-
past eight, and were ushered straight into the
concert-room. Other people found their way
about by printed programmes, that directed to
the joys of different floors. It was a great glitter-
ing Aladdin’s-palace sort of affair. Everywhere
there was something to see, free. On the first
floor, the concert-room ; on the second, Mrs. St.
Hill, a very crack palmist, just from London (by-
the-way, she is no relation to Miss Alexia St. Hill,
who has quite given up palmistry lately for
“metaphysics”): on the third floor, Madame
Raprah, a physiognomist ; on the fourth, a cine-
matograph ; on the fifth, a ball-room and luring
Bavarian band. Refreshments went on every-
where. Therein lay the only blur on this beautiful
spree. Many people went home without finding
out the solid spread down underground in the
Manhattan Tea-Rooms.
The frocking was remarkably well-considered.
Mrs. Willie Mitchell was in cerise satin, slashed-
up over flounces of white chiffon, with short black
chiffon sash. Mrs. Learoyd was ethereal enough
to wear a gauzy white mousseline se soie. Miss
Grace Noble topped a blue-brocade skirt witli a
chiffon bodice, and wore the new black unintelli-
gent flowers on her corsage. Mrs. Ted Rundle
was also in light blue, a lovely combination of
poplin and pearls. Mrs. Harry Levy wore white
net shimmering with silversaquins. Anothersnappy
sequin frock was worn by Mrs. “Nellie Cox ’’Trench,
who is paying a flying visit to her family ; she still
wears her hair & la Lady Carrington, in a thick
fringe on her forehead. English women stick to
this style persistently, led on by the Princess of
Wales, Countess of Warwick, and others. (By
the way, I saw it printed the other day that Lady
Carrington’s hair had gone snow-white). Mrs.
Trench wreathed the latest circlet of pink baby-
roses round her top-knot. So did Lady Macleay,
and several others.
As this Conversazione was about the smartest
thing we’ve had for ever so long, one gathered
many hints and forecasts of fashion. For instance,
the hair was all dressed top-mast high, and well to
the front of tire head. Flags of ribbon, which look
careless, but are carefully wired, waved alongside.
Several smart women tied artless blue or pink
ribbon round the knob, and pinned a tall black
feather straight up in front. Others heaved gardens
over their heads. Paris says that flowers in the
hair must be so many and so widely spread that a
middle-aged flower bonnet results. And every
well-educated skirt is a flat waste below the belt
at the back. The placket-hole is invisible at the
side. Not a gather of any sort must disturb the
flatness of that back-breadth. On a thin woman
it is dangerous, on a fat one it is death—sartorially
speaking.
In the concert room, vice-regal people sat in the
front row quite close to the performers. His Ex.
talked to Lady Bertha, who was in black with
white chiffon sleeves. The little feminine ferment
who was driving everybody to despair, has dis-
appeared lately. She and her mother are on a
visit to their country home, and other girls breathe
again. As for the concert, everyone was in such
a highly-excited state, thinking of the palmist and
the physiogonomist and ballroom, that the artists
caught the flurried atmosphere of the audience,
and didn’t all perform on their best legs. Signor
de Beaupuis played Liszt with a golden touch.
Naturally, his Ketten piece didn’t go well to the
accompaniment of the big band playing the “ Blue
Danube” outside. Stael and Vollmar—of course ;
Vollmar was presented to Lady Mary after-
wards, and congratulated. Miss Beatrice Esmond
I heard for the first time. She is a pretty little
woman, with a lot of history attached. She sang
with a strange lip contortion, but with plenty of
go. She and Madame Lotta Harkness give joint
recitals next month. One utterly-uncooked pro-
duct got into the programme somehow, and tossed
all the largest Horsetralian vowels in your teeth
with a self-complacent smile. Considering all the
other only half-raw singers belonging to us, this
quite “raw” is unforgivable. Mr. Beattie’s round
sweet voice rang out cheerfully in the Toreador’s
song. The concert lasted but three-quarters of an
hour, without one repeat. Yet the programme
was of ordinary length, which shows how well
tilings can lie done under good management, and
without encores.
A performance of indescribable unspeakablencss,
in which a sister played Romeo to another sister’s
Juliet, and another sister played Paris to her other
sisters, punished the boards of the Palace Theatre
on Tuesday evening. “Romeo and Juliet,’’mis-
interpreted by the Maoriland family of play-at-
actors, showed how very long charity suffereth.
Some of the generous patrons, who had come
through the rain to the d.c. and front stalls to
support the deserving Sydney Hospital, sat out
the performance. However, if the hospital bene-
fits in the long-run, the means are forgiven for the
sake of the end. The Greenwoods do not
possess a single R amongst the five or six of them.
Under these conditions, you will understand how
hard it was for anyone to call Romeo or Paris by
name ; and then there were other things.
Speaking of charities, the Grand Fancy Fair
opens on Thursday, August 10th, at the Exhi-
bition Building. I daresay you “ know that all of
yore, ” as placards are everywhere pasted on the city
to tell the tale. Lord Beauchamp has the Souvenir
Book under his charge. An heroic committee
invited him to throw off a little poem as his auto-
graph contribution, but he smiled sadly and
murmured “No more poetry,” or words to that
effect. But Lord Brassey, who has no poetry to
speak of in his past, comes out with a verse of
Browning.
Masonic Ball came off at the Town Hall
last Thursday in an enormous crowd. This hop
always draws record galleries. Draws, too, all
that is weird and wonderful in the way of frocks
and coiffures. Some Aldermanic ladies came out
in toilettes a pork-pie-dream matron might
affect. For instance, there was a fifteen-stoner,
in a pink satin skirt to her ankles, a red velvet
blouse, white satin shoes, paste buckles, and pearl
trimming stuck on everywhere a blank space
offered, and hair done up alongside of a bunch of
cabbage roses with long green stalks ending in
dewdrops rearing out of the roses. But she was
nothing to a twonty-stoner in green fly-net, with
no sleeves, and no neck, and a tower of auburn
hair, surrounded with balconies of red poppies and
pink bows, and paste buckles. A moral lesson in
{esthetics is always protruding from these balls.
Many of the frocks, if you could see them lying on
the bed with nobody inside them, would strike envy
into your heart. But the wearers sidle at them,
shy away from them, never melt into their., and
carry them on their backs as though there was a
great gulf fixed between them. All the same the
hop went off like a cannon-ball. His Ex. and
Lady Mary came after the Masonic ceremonies,
and mixed themselves up in the crowd, generously.
Lady Mary always dances a good deal. His Ex.
contented himself with the V.R. Lancers and
Mrs. Remington (in yellow brocade), wife of the
Grand Master. Nobody in this inside set was
dressed outrageously well. Lady Mary repeated
a solemn grey brocade, with bands of dark fur at
the neck. The Hon. Violet Somerset cooled her
bright cheeks in black satin. Miss Daisy Wright
was the smartest figure on the dais—in black silk
muslin, interwoven with a dull-blue pattern, an
outline of turquoise velvet at the top of the bodice,
and a long black feather in her undulated hair.
Mrs. Teece scattered black-jet trimmings over a
white brocade, and struck yellow notes in her
smartly-dressed head. Mayoress and Miss Harris
were both in beaded black.
By-the-way, Mayoress Harris is to be given a
complimentary tea by lady members of various
charitable committees on which the beaming
mayoressal smile has so often shone. The tea will
be altogether feminine. It comes off at the
“Australia ” on Thursday next.
The Society of Artists is getting ready for its
annual ball, which is to be a plain one this year—
that is to say, not fancy. Mr. Goring-Thomas and
Mr. Leo Dobbin are acting as secretaries to the
hop, and have fixed on Aug; 31st, at Needs’ Rooms.
It seems that a much-talked-of engagement
leaked out through an unexpected hole. It was
not intended for the public ear just yet, but a girl
friend of the bride’s caught sight of the engage-
ment-ring one day, and wormed out the story—
under the seal of dead secresy, of course. The
bride’s family were in recent, and deep, mourning.
They wanted to keep the matter quiet awhile. So
quiet, indeed, that even the bridegroom’s people
hadn’t been acquainted with the news. But the
girl-friend simply couldn’t contain such copy. She
wrote off a detailed account of all she had been
told to a Melbourne paper. Next day, a Sydney
paper reprinted. Then there was consternation.
The man’s family attacked him for not telling
them. The girl’s consumed themselves with
wonder how that paper ever got to know. “ Isn’t
there anyone you told as a dead secret ? ” asked
the bridegroom-to-be. “ No, there was only one
girl I told as the very dead, dead, deadest secret,”
said the bride. “ Humph ! ” said the bridegroom
—who is a widower and knows a thing or two.
At times, Henrietta Watson, in the “King’s
Musketeer," looks like Sister Elizabeth. Shelias
altered considerably since she was here last, and
is much thinner in the face. From a fine, strapping
girl, she has merged into a Potteresque being with
her dark hair puffed round her face like a Beards-
ley being, and shows a. new genius for posing
with her back to the audience, and her hands
behind her. But those marvellous, sloping
shoulders of hers have come back unspoiled, and
she reveals every inch of them in Miiadi’s low-cut
frocks.
On Saturday a big - house welcomed the new
play warmly, but without a single flower. And
the d.c. was clad in black almost to a
woman. The whole of the front row leaned
over out of black trappings, and the flowers in the
hair had to be very gorgeous to brighten up this
sombreness. Theatre gloves are quite defunct.
Long sleeves to the knuckles take their place.
But what an ugly thing is a long, thin, knobby
ann, like a hat-rack, creeping barely out of no
sleeve to speak of, and continuing in wicked
nakedness down to its scraggy finger-tips ! The
best-dressed Society woman in Sydney always
wears short sleeves, and goes gloveless at theatres
and concerts: but then her arms have a natural
covering.
Is Newbury trying to educate the people up to
Beethoven at a shilling a head ; or is he hoping to
translate the classics into popular slanguage ? At
a recent Pop. he had the lights turned very low
for “The Moonlight Sonata.” Friedenthal was
playing. But it was a nasty, unsoulful, ignorant
house. The back seats thought that the dimness
meant they were to kiss their girls, and un-
attached boys set up a hubbub. After some
yelling and stamping the lights were turned up,
and it was found that Beethoven could survive the
strongest light.
Some new songs from Paling and Co. are “A
Fairy Song,” by Wilfrid W. Gibson and Edith
Dick, a light, little, pretty thing, that must not
be executed by anyone over fourteen stone ; “Rosa,
a Spanish Serenade,” by A. C. Bunten, a well-
written song that wails tunefully about hearts and
guitars ; and “ Australian Federation, ” by A. Seal,
Professor, which I scarcely dare call a song nor yet
a hymn, as the title seems to argue against either.
“ Advance Australia ” occurs often, and the music
has a sacred ring, that should recommend the piece
to Y.M.C.A.’s drinking lemonade round a chilly
fire. Paling and Co. also send Sylvia Blackstone’s
new waltz, “Zarona, ” a thing of chords and
crashes, which isn’t up to her other waltzes,
although it was written expressly for and dedi-
cated to Lord Beauchamp. Glen and Co. send
“ As a Bird from its Nest,” poetically frontis-
pieced with a portrait of Amy Castles, which
reads and sounds like an attempt to tell Amy to
say her prayers and be a good girl, and come back
with a big fortune.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
‘‘Hon. Tom Brassey is coming out on a brief
visit to his noble Dad at Government House,
Melbourne, to talk to him seriously re his health,
his habit of falling-off, and other matters. Judging
from some of Gov. Brassey’s recent appearances
in public, it is quite time that his family persuaded
the ex-mariner to take more care of himself.
“Other days, other ways. A present Australian
governor meekly bows his hoary head before the
little tempers of his last-born. Recently driving
in semi-state through metropolitan streets, the
viceregal couple wedged the infant in question
safely between them, ignoring the rebel’s resist-
ance, so as not to invite public scrutiny into her
mutiny. Meantime Mksie frowned her blackest,
doubied-up and straightened-out like a jumping-
jack, and elbowed the parental ribs.
“Pa Brassey has just been informed by cable
of the advent of a new grandchild (daughter
Freeman-Thomas’s second son). Joy-bells would
be ringing had the mannikin fallen to the share
of his Ex.’s only son and Lady Idina Brassey ( nee
Nevill).
“Despite brilliant press notices, the two last
viceregal balls were practically frosts. Numbers
of jteople, usually invited were left out, and of
those who received invitations and accepted
them, only about half responded in person.
At the Friday ball, during one dance only three
sets of lancers were going.
“ Champagne bottles at a certain grand ball had
their labels scraped off. From the streaks of label
still sticking to the pint-bottles on the supper-
table nobody, however astute, could guess the
brand. Was that done by the magnificent
lacqueys because the brand was so-so, or for fear
of jealousy among the many big agents who are in
a social position to be invited ?
“ The latest vagary of fashion: Two well-known
Society girls, in half-mourning for their sister-in-
law, appeared at last Government House ball in
chastened costumes, with narrow black ribbons
round their necks, tied in bows in front, the long
ends falling almost to their skirts.
“ At a novel tea in Melbourne a girl appeared
with an illustrated post-card pinned to her dress.
On the front of the card was a picture of Govern-
ment House. Few guessed the novel intended;
it was ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin.’
“ One of Melbourne’s really nicest girls is going
to join the Brough Comedy Co. shortly. The
belle is Miss Edith Gavin Brown, a witty and
clever amateur actress who seems built to do things
on the stage.
“A full house welcomed back the ‘Chinatown ’
trippers with seeming glee. On the first night
everyone must have indulged in an extra dab of
make-up. Even Wallace Brownlow seemed to
have overdone his cultivation of a glassy-blue
stage-glance and red-rosebud mouth. In certain
lights, the new girls looked as if they’d been
smelling a rat in the flour-bag, and some of them
affected blue black top-eyelids. Carrie Moore—
pert, pretty, light-heeled—was, maybe, the cutest
she-critter on view.
“ Madame Wiedernmnn sang nine songs at the
Brahms concert in Melbourne last Friday—fancy
nine Brahms songs at a breath, as it were! And
ye amateurs—notice how ‘Madame’ sings, not
only with her voice but with her brains. When
she sings ‘ Wenn ieh bleicli und halt,’ it is bleak
and cold, and you feel a chill running all through
the lino. It takes more than a voice to make a
singer like the Wiedermann. The voice is just the
instrument ; it is the brain of the artist behind it
that makes the singer.
“ Curly-headed Louis Hattenbach, the ’cellist,
appeared for the last time before his departure for
America at a Brahms concert last Friday. An
evening of Bralnns music might be expected to be
rather headachy ; for Brahms is, above all
others, an intellectual musician. But the selec-
tions were judicious, and the concert delightful.
In Brahms’ concerted music, the instruments seem
to be constantly arguing with each other, as in
Beethoven. The argument starts in the allegro
movement; heads are broken, and the combatants
jump on each other in the allegretto ; and in the
final movement they trudge off to the hospital,
arguing all the way.
“In time even the square peg gets to fit its
round hole not so badly. Most municipal mag-
nates die fatted flesh-potters, not excepting those
who began life with yearnings after a diet of rose-
leaves and dew. Lately a team of athletes
arriving from a sister-province were driven from
the train to the local civic stronghold. At that
time of day, the travel-stained, jaded guests
apparently took little joy in the provided ‘cakes
and ale.’ But it was a Horrible Warning to watch
the hosts gormandize, scarcely pausing to snort for
air between their gulps of confectionery and fizz.
“Grandmotherly disciplinarians justify their
advocacy of the rod by reference to V.R.’s long-
ago visit to Belfast (Ireland) with some of her
then small fry. As the royalties drew near
Belfast quay, sounds of smart slaps and youthful
wailings wafted from the cabin-in-ehief told wel-
coming subjects that their Gracious Queen could
wield a corrective slipper as well as a sceptre.
“ Many people here remember Mrs. Brunei
Norntan (Adey Brunei) who elocuted in Australia
a few years ago. She was a niece of Sir William
-Tenner, the Queen’s physician. She had a hus-
band with her—-a mild erratic youth. The pair
now run concerts in London, as ‘ Mr. and Mrs.
Norman-Concorde.’ By last mail arrive pro-
grammes of Norman-Concorde concerts; and
announcements that the said N.-C.’s ‘guarantee
the artistic ability of those they specially recom-
mend.’ The cleverest thing the little woman did
in Melbourne was a delightful imitation of the
manner of a sister elocutionist's pupils, a malicious
bit of burlesque, the remembrance of which sends
those who ever saw it into fits of laughter when
they see one of the said pupils reciting, even to
this day.
“Be those Ballarat Reformatory girls, who ran
away, because, so they said, they didn’t like
‘man’s work, digging wells,’etc. ; some damsels
prefer rough and ready be-done-with-it jobs to
endless, pernieketty household - pottering. I
know a sturdy sixteen-year-old ‘rescued’ from a
supposedly cruel step-father, who made her
split timber, help with the cross-cut saw, See. The
fugitive was put in training for domestic drudgery,
but soon fled back to the bark humpy, where she
went bare-foot, lived on nanny-goat and pumpkin,
and slept under the stars whenever her guardian
got drunk. ‘At the old man’s,’ she explained,
‘ when I ain’t splittin’ 1 lay on the broad of me
back and see how long I can keep on lookin’at the
sun. Here I get no spell. If I ain’t workin’, I’m
jorin’—tel I in’ how old I am, and if I can read, and
whether I’ve ever been to church, and all that.’
“Flats are becoming fashionable in Melbourne.
The big building called Queen Bess Row, formerly
Miss M'Cartncy’s private hospital, is now entirely
taken for lodgings, and contains all manner of
people—families, bachelors, spinsters; most of
whom hurry off in the morning to their various
offices. Occasionally from an attic to the next
floor is heard a cry of “ Can you lend me a loaf,
or a drop of milk?” or “ Wko'n taken my broom
—’pon my word I think it’s a shame,” &c. Every-
one is peaceable on the whole, and all wander In
and out at all times with latch-keys.

MR. BRIGAOW BOGONG : “ Mr. President an’

Federal laws was perfect. Well, they ain’t so;
an’ I ask you, gen’elmen, to look at their in-

He was the only man of whom lawyer
Jellicoe was frightened ; and, on the other

skeleton who adorned the Bench, were things to

Slab of eloquence from gasbag Monk, of
Waitemata, M.L.:
And that head appeals to our imagination as well as to
our hearts—appealing even in the mute eloquence with
which it asserts its claim to a transcendent fame, bring-
ing to our minds the story of a reign that is distinguished
for a towering ascent of British power, and specially
replete with scientific discovery and marvellous invention
—a reign in which the feats of Aladdin dwarf before the
colossus of her people’s wealth, and the poet in the
highest fervor of his dreams but acts the drowsy laggard
in the wake of her nation’s progress. Do you think, sir,
I am wrong in pleading for the replacing of the effigy of
a hc-ad so significant witli transcendent memories upon
the postage-stamps of our colony?
11l connection with the recent cable about
a Russian officer suiciding because the Czar had
reproved him for letting the deceased Czarewitch
cycle unattended, it is wortli while noting the also
recent press-statement that “in the Caucasus
murder has of late years reached an incredible
degree. The land is becoming uninhabitable, so
infested is it with robbers.” Put it all together—
“ Hemorrhage of the throat ” (Ist account); “ bi-
cycle accident” (2ndaccount); “allowing George to
bike alone ” (acompanion could not have prevented
a smash), “and the local prevalence of murder.”
It looks as if yet another Romanoff has been mur-

Not generally known that Chief Justice
Robert Stout has in his veins a mixture of Spanish
and Scandinavian blood. The Iberian strain
comes from an officer who escaped drowning at
the wreck of one of the Armada ships in the North
Sea and found an asylum and a wife among the
Shetlanders, who are pure “Scandies.” This
possibly accounts for the sallow complexion and
coal-black hair of Stout.
The Kipling influence gets into even the
British Wesleyan Methody Conference. A Rev.
F. W. Macdonald has been much paragraphed as
the uncle of Kipling, and the advt. has no doubt
helped him into the office of president, in suc-

Besides Kipling’s mother, the Rev. President Mac.
has the wives of knighted artists Burne-Jones
(deceased) and Poynter for sisters.
Wm. Malpas, who stepped out of a boat
at Holdfast Bay, the birthplace of South Aus-
tralia, ran up a tent, and with an associate forth-
with opened business for the English-owned Bank
of South Australia, died in Adelaide the other
day. This pioneering banking experience was in
the first days of ’37 ; the province was only pro-
claimed in the last days of Dec., ’36. Mr. Malpas
has been quite out of the public eye for a genera-
tion.
“ The reward of valor.” Of the half-
dozen leaders who were gaoled for their part in

.Parliament. And now the Labor-party, having at
last secured a majority in the local municipal coun-
cil, provides Polkinghorne with the first public
office available —the assistant-inspectorship of

Thomas Wardell Hammond is dead, at 74.
It was Hammond’s Speckleback which carried
news from Old Junee to Wagga—22 miles in one
hour —when bushrangers stuck up Old Junee
nearly 40 years ago. Speckleback won that time ;
but, a week later, the Ben Hall gang stuck up
Hammond and made him hand over Speckleback
and five other of his best horses. Hammond was
a founder of the Riverina Racing Club, and was
very popular in his district.
Napier (Maoriland) Herald on a good old

The old fire of Richard Seddon, the once lion-hearted,
is dying out with increasing age and the f oils of office,
involving more work than is done by any other half-a-
dozen men in the province. The old warrior is failing

him to the Premiership, they will have defeated a weary,
worn-out man. But he dies game, fighting for his head

Shortly after late Commissioner Eddy took

Mr. T. Streater writes: “ I have received so
much benefit from Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa I feel
that I must thank you for it. I am a baker by
trade, which,-as you know, is very hard work, but
I am pleased to say that when I am done of a
night, I go home and have a cup of your Cocoa,
and feel quite fresh again, and then I go and enjoy
myself. But before I took to Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-
Cocoa I used to mess about indoors as tired as
could be.”
Vi-Cocoa will become a household word amongst
us. Prepared from substances of admitted dietetic
value, Dr. Tibbies’Vi-Cocoa is at once digestive
and refreshing, nutritious, and invigorating. This
is the secret of its phenomenal success. It seems,
so far as we can gather, to agree with everybody,
and everybody is agreed in giving it a good name*.
Apparently it is the accepted beverage of a people
who have recognised and appreciated its remark-
able health-giving properties. And, certainly, in
this age of rush and worry, wear and tear, when
the energies of mind and body are so severely
taxed, it is an ideal food.
Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa can be obtained from all
chemists, grocers, and stores, or from Dr. Tibbies’
Vi-Cocoa, Limited, 269 George-street, Sydney.
As an unparalleled test of merit, a dainty
sample tin of Vi-Cocoa will be sent free on appli-
cation to any address, if when writing (a post-card
will do) the reader will name The Bulletin.*

W. Gr. Brookman, the Boulder millionaire,
formerly ran a jam-factory ; now, someone has
started a jam-factory on his behalf—in a Perth
paper. Brookman has just shifted into a new
residence, and after writing a column-and-a-half
about Brookman’s bronzes, and his parrots, and
(40-guinea) window-curtains, and (100-guinea)
vases, the obsequious scribe winds up thus :
A charming room is Mr. Brookman’s own particular
sanctum or study. It is also hung with dark-tinted
paper, and the carpet is in consonance : also the carved
walnut furniture, roll-top desk escritoire, book-
oase, and cabinets, &c.; while the centre table is
covered with a cloth of Indian make, embroidered
in gold thread. A quaint object in one corner
is a polished walnut barrel on a stand, having silver
hoops, and labelled “ Falstaff.” On opening this is dis-
covered a liqueur-stand, with every requisite for the re-
freshment of the inner man. A novel tobacco case is a
stag’s head in bronze, and novel figures here and there
hold aloft electric globes in colored glass. All over the
house a blaze of light is instantly thrown by the pressing
of a button in the hall. The window-hangings in the
study and dining-room are bordered with guipure d’ap-
plique, of most expensive style, and in the best bed-
room, which is as large as the drawing-room, the
window-curtains are of brocade, lined with satin, and
edged with a foot-wide border of Venetian Honiton
lace, each pair (there are three) costing sixty guineas.
The bed, which looks like the State beds Jin pictures of
kingly palaces, is of the Louis Seize style, and is formed
of solid walnut, carved in high relief, with a grand
carven canopy, from which depends a festooned drape of
brocade to match the window-hangings, and edged with
the same exquisite lace. The brocade is ivory-colored,
the design being clusters of pink roses and foliage. The
bed-spread is of the same material, only cut out in the
shape of diamonds, and appliqued with squares, triangles,
and circles of pieces of hand-made lace, a deep frill of
the same surrounding the whole. This superb bed-
spread was bought for 70 guineas. The linen, towels,
pillow-cases, &c., cost such a fabulous sum that readers
may not credit the fact that exquisite linen diaper, or
damask towels, with ten-inch lace at each end, cost £i
10s. to £7 10s. each, but anyone seeing and handling
them would know that it is the hand-made lace that gives
the value. One sheet, wider than the ordinary sheet, as
long, and bordered with Venetian point, was only 40
guineas, a second specimen being 23 guineas. Pillow-
slips, nearly all lace, are of equal value, according to size,
and the massive bedroom suite matches the bedstead,
being of richly carved solid walnut, while the ewers and
basins are of Bohemian glass, traced with gold.
The bed “ looks like the State beds in pictures of
kingly palaces.” Yet Brookman stands about 4ft.
llin. high, weighs (say) 104Ibs. Also, he carries a
trick walking-stick, into which the barman at the
Australia, when Brookman visits Sydney, pours
matutinally ninepenn’orth of brandy. “It holds
exactly ninepenn’orth,” says Brookman, proudly,
as he screws up the end of his curio.
In the early ’7o’s, G. Republican Dibba
occupied the first floor of premises in Pitt-street,
Sydney, the basement being occupied by a
holy pillar of the church and his six severely
proper clerks, who all taught in Sunday-
school. Among Dibbs’s frequent visitors
was the late John Robertson, and their
interviews always terminated much as
follows, for the benefit of the pious gen-
tleman below. When old Jack reached
the street-door he would pause, return
to the bottom of the stairs (as a man
who had just remembered something)
and shout, “Dibbs! Dibbs, you !
Dibbs ! ” Promptly would thunder down-
stairs, “ Hallo, you old blank !
What the blank are you kicking
up that dash blank row about ? ”
Then the pious gentleman would
shudder and put his fingers in
his ears, and the six proper
young men would look appropri-
ately horrified while the cyclone
oelow would continue its storm of
highly-seasoned remarks and the
tempest above would nobly keep
up its end of the holiness. Finally,
with a tremendous bang of his office-
door, the good man on the base-
ment would signify his righteous
indignation, and old Jack would de-
part chuckling hugely, while Dibbs
guffawed up-stairs.
“ L.”: Truth is stranger than
fiction. In 1835, the writer’s uncle
—Oscar Jones, for the purposes of
this story—an officer in the Bri-
tish army, sold out and emi-
grated, without taking the
trouble to mention where he
was going. The Earth swal-
lowed him up till 1887, in
which year I was taken down
a mine at Temora, N.S.W.,
sight-seeing. At the end of a
long “ drive,” my guide introduced
me to the overseer, who was superintending
some work. “Jones,” said he, “do you spell
it ‘ J.O.N.E.S. ?’ Why, that was my grand-
father’s name.” And it turned out that the grand-
father was the traditional lost Oscar Jones of our
family, who had departed in ’35.
Bert Levy sends The Bulletin some re-
collections of George Gordon, scene-painter and
White Man: —
I spent seven years at the side of George Gordon on
the painting-frame—years teeming with the recollections
of the kindly instructor and true friend. Gordon seemed
to consider every man in the theatre —actor, super.,
stage-hand, or splodger—as under his special care, and
in case of trouble he would inquire all about it; then no
stone would be left unturned to do something for the
sufferer. He was an extremely nervous and sensitive
man, and, as already mentioned in The Bulletin, fainted
on his first (and last) visit to a dissecting-room, and there-
after stuck strictly to landscape. Gordon could not hurt
any living thing, and, calling the splodger (assistant) one
day to remove a big beetle from his palette, was careful
to add, “ But, mind, don’t kill it!” Another time there
strayed into the painting-room a miserable creature of a
cat, Which some of the boys in the property-room had
been “gilding and decorating.” Poor Gordon was
greatly concerned, and, after having the creature washed
and warmed at the stove, sent out to get milk for it.
Gordon had a great admiration for his friend, Phil May,
and whenever Phil came to Melbourne he would sit for
hours in the painting-loft, yarning. Now and again he
would illustrate a remark with the charcoal on any clear
space of the back-cloth Gordon was painting, and Gordon
would paint all around Phil’s sketch before reluctantly
painting over it. I recollect Gordon painting the corn-
field for the first act of “ Dorothy,” and when he knocked
off for the night, the sky was just laid in, and on the
horizon were a sketch of Premier Parkes, a caricature of
Grattan Riggs, and some wonderfully funny Hebrew faces.
Next day, when Gordon came to lay-in the distance,
he could hardly bring himself to obliterate Phil’s work.
Phil was in the painting-room with Gordon on the night
of Fred Leslie’s first appearance in Australia at the Prin-
cess’. He saw Leslie from the flies, and sketched on the
painting-room wall a life-size head. Gordon treasured
that head-sketch for years, and every time the. theatre
was being cleaned he would carefully instruct the
white - washers to circumnavigate May’s sketch.
Two years ago, when the drawing was getting
faint, Gordon took ap impression of it with sized-paper.
Gordon was full of anecdotes of Irving, Bancroft, Toole,
Leighton, Millais, &c. In fact, he was a mine of informa-
tion about art and artists. A Sunday morning’s stroll
with him through the Botanical Gardens was a treat. He
would stop and go into ecstasies over each little view,

about the paint-room, but, though I tried hard to please
him, I could never get more out of him than “ Ah ! that's
a little better till one day I ventured to ask if he
couldn’t say something stronger. “Well,” he replied
humorously, “if I say ‘good,’ ‘beautiful,’ or ‘grand,’
what is there left for me to say to AlmaTadema, Bunie
Jones, or Peter Graham ?” He liked his little joke always,
and once, when I was making a study of some fruit, he
found fault with my color. “My boy,” he said, “watch
nature. Don’t take your eyes off nature, and paint only
what you see.” Then, unknown to me, he covered the
fruit with an apron, and I worked on for half-an-hour
before I found it out. While painting, Gordon was seldom
without a cigarette in his mouth, and, as he kept putting
them down after a few puffs and lighting fresh ones, his
leavings used to pretty well keep some of the hands in
smoke. Gordon’s strong point in painting was old-
English architecture, and he positively loved to handle a
fine old interior. Some of his miniature models of stage-
settings are works of art in themselves, and I have often
marvelled at his modelling, say, an old village street,
with bits of coal for rocks, little cardboard bridges, and a
little track of flake-white, altering things again and
again, and lingering over his work far into the night.
George Gordon—to sum up—loved everybody and every-
thing—except whistling, and the modern suburban villa

SomeN.S.W. ancients still gazing at the

Mrs. Weston, at Annandale, July 23, 1806;
William Byrne, brother of Mrs Carey, bo at

July 25 was the 37th anniversary of the
completion of McDouall Stuart’s historic acr<">-

party to the Indian Ocean. Though Stuart, w lib
stands right in the front rank of explorers ai y
where, died as long ago as ’66, only three of 'the
nine who formed his party are dead. P. W.
Thring (second assistant), W. P. Auld, Steph-n
King, Heath Nash, and John McGorrery still
live in South Australia; and schoolmaster Bil-
liott lately went to England. They were tough
fellows whom Stuart chose ; partly on that ac-
count he never lost a life. And, by the way, he
didn’t use a camel either.
A martyr to principle (writes a Bulletin
correspondent) is a Pentridge prisoner who once
starred with the Salvarmy as a reformed criminal.
He is the. only professed atheist on the prison
books and passes the church hour locked up in his
cell, thus missing the highly-valued weekly relaxa-
tion of lifting up the voice in hymns. As the
Reading bard sung:—
We banged the tins and bawled the hymns
And polished up the rails.
Noise relieves prison-tension, and the Pentridge
atheist will probably end in a fit of yelling and
battering his cell-furniture. In which event his
last state will be worse than his first!

“ 0.P.” : Appalling is the indifference of
the Australian station-hand about the abuse to
which his unfortunate stomach is subjected. He
has to gorge tasteless, flabby boiled mutton (with
cancer, hydatids, &0., thrown in) three times a
day; the flour from which his bread is made is
often weevily and rotten through long exposure to
heat; his tea and sugar are largely composed of
black lead and bone-dust; and the black, rank
“ tobacco ” that he smokes incessantly is an abso-
lute horror. Add to these the attentions of the
mercurial pill-man, of the “ poisoner ” or amateur
oook, and of the other poisoner who lives in a tin
house at the cross-roads, and cease to wonder at
the intemperance, disease, profanity, and insanity
that are so inseparable from bandy legs, peeled
nose, and the smell of yolk. These remarks also

Crow gathers all the pieces of meat his beak will

Corres, after eyeing it greedily, runs to fern-box

“ Tongarra ” : 7?e quickness of aboriginal
children (8., 8/7/’99). I taught once, in a border
aboriginal school, about 80 children, ranging from
pure black, through copper, brown, and amber, to
white. Found the full-blacks good triers but
with no capacity, and the half-castes, though on
the whole smart, were curiously weak in memory-
work. Their minds seemed too volatile to be re-
tentive. They were particularly good at writing
and drawing, while in mental arithmetic they
were ahead of the average white child. On one
occasion Mr. Bruford (the Vic. financial authority),
after hearing a class put through some rapid
mental calculations, remarked to me that he had
tried to follow the maze of figures himself, but was
beaten by the pace. The girls were, as a rule,
quicker than the boys. The head-teacher of this
school, by the way, is a Hindoo, and olever, well-
educated, and well-mannered at that.

“F.W.K.”: Ever go fishing for wood?
Not in water, but in air. When there’s no wood
on the ground, and no axe with which to “down”
it, you must get your whaling line, fix on a sar-
dine-tin or stone for a sinker, and heave line over
a small, dry limb ; then walk round until you get
it well tangled above—pull, and down comes your
“ fish.” Arizona Ike is simply notin it with some
of the wood-lassoers in the big river-bends.
“0.P.”: “Ashton Murphy’s sketch,
“ Pulling out bogged sheep,” is not so absurd as
might be thought; in faot, the idea has much to
recommend it, when the harness is away on loan,
or you haven’t any harness-horse. Any horse will
pull a small tail-load, such as boughs for a sheep-
brake, bag of dead wood, &c. Every horse, like
every man, has an inborn dislike for work—
[Nonsense. Lots of men have an inborn love of
work.] —and when strained solely from behind
goes the other way in consequence. With the
collar there is too much “ pressing him to stay,”
as it were. The rope must be tied securely about
the middle joint of the tail, and no more than
half a load attempted. As to cruelty, I have not
been able to ascertain what the horse thinks
about it.

“Dominie”: The growing practice of
abolishing the hour-and-half midday recess in
some N.S.W. country public-schools has only to
be vigorously assailed by local medical men to
make the Dept, interfere. The chief-inspector,
for one, is strongly opposed to all attempts to
shorten pupils’ recess. Let him be medically ap-
proached on the matter, and the grievance will be
soon redressed. School-children in our climate
need abundance of fresh air and time to masticate
their food thoroughly. You should see my rosy-
cheeked young ruffians.
In the old days, when
D station was renowned
for its brumby-runs, the
best horsemen of the dis-
trict would gather there,
honest and dishonest, un-
wanted and “ wanted ”
latter sure of welcome on
arrival and assistance on de-
parture, if necessary. Once,
when a big run was in an-
ticipation, Spifkins, the lo-
cal sub-inspector of police,
determined on a haul. He
had many “wants” to
satisfy, and thought the
time propitious. Accord-
ingly, on the evening of the
meet, he rode into camp
with three troopers, but the
manager, knowing his man,
passed the word : “O.K.—
Don’t leave.” There was a
good supply of rum on hand,
and it was kept moving in
the sub’s vicinity with such
vigor that presently ho geni-
ally d d every official
duty “until the morning.”
That was enough. A man
was promptly told-off to
“keep it up to him,” and
when, 48 hours later, Spif-
kins “came to the surface,”
he was told many things
that he didn’t quite swal-
low. Still, he was half-con-
vinced that he had com-
mitted 17 different crimes
while in a blissful state of
grog, and that nearly all the
“ wanteds ” had seen him
doing them. Anyhow, there
was no help for it—his birds
were flown. Sub-inspector
S. drank himself to death at
a “shanty,” whilst osten-
sibly enquiring into the
death of a subordinate, who had perir jed of
many bootfuls of snakes at the same precic as hole.

“Tramp” : Trudging Riverina last sum-

in such mortal fear of smash-up that he returned

The most comprehensive
cattle run in Rougemont’s country,
N.W. Australia, sweeps in six
million acres ; there is another of
four millions; and Conor, the
Westralian M.P. for the score
or so of Kimberley electors, re-
presents a firm which holds 3g
million acres. Part of Conor’s
holding is in Westralia and the
rest in the N. Territory ; and,
in consequence of Bigjohn’s
tick regulations, cattle may
not now be shifted from one
part of the run to the other.
So Conor, who has hitherto
dealt only with Westralian
politicians, comes over to get
concessions from S.A. —jetties
constructed, and so on. As to
tick, he says there is plenty up
there (in “ the finest cattle
country in Australia ”), but it
doesn’t do any harm.

ever, after due consideration, go so far as to ex-
press dissent, then the whole crowd will promptly
endorse him also, as if he was lunatic No. 2. Pecu-

The cook who can build “ all kinds of a variety of

long out of a job.
Things are quiet in far Cooktown,
The days are dull and cold,

Upon the mountain bold.
The Chinamen who run the show
Are tired, and broke, and weak ;
The pub. has got its shutters up—
The barmaid’s in the creek.
No more the sweet, rich scent of rum
Will roll across the plain ;
For cash is gone, and tick is done.
The red blind glares in vain.
A busy city by the sea
Has sunk and settled down,
A goat, two Chinkies and a dog
Now own the blanky town.

One of the most wonderful inventions of
the age is Willson’s discovery of crystalline carbide
of calcium. There is little doubt that acetylene
gas is about to revolutionise artificial lighting.
As with all successful patents, a host of pirates
have started up to try and rob Willson of his
rights. However, the recent decision of the High
Courts at Leipsic, Germany, will somewhat damp
the ardour of Willson’s opponents. It has been
decided that Willson is undoubtedly the discoverer
of crystalline carbide of calcium. Following up
this success, the English Acetylene Company have
issued a batch of writs against infringers, and the
Acetylene Gas Co. of Australasia Ltd., of 36 Pitt-
street, Sydney—who own the Willson patents for
Australasia —are getting ready to give the Aus-
tralian pirates a surprise. Thisco. have now fitted
up some hundreds of installations around Sydney,
and are prepared to give estimates for any kind of
acetylene installations. Write direct to 36 Pitt-
street, and beware of infringers.*

be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a

“Te Bum” : “Pukaki” (B. 24/6/’99) is
wrong about an incision in the bark of the matai-
tree bringing forth a “beer,” and also about same
being sweetish. Not every matai-tree contains
this beer, and I have always had to get near the
heart of the tree with axe or auger to reach this
juice, which will sometimes squirt out to a dis-
tance of yards. It is a good thirst-allayer and
tastes not unlike alum. Bushmen often sweeten
it with sugar, as had probably been done with
what “Pukaki” tasted.

“D.G.S.”: Be snakes (“F.P.,”8. 8/7/’99).
Five months' is not an extraordinary time for a
snake to go foodless. Under ordinary climatic
conditions, most of our snakes have perforce to
do without food for four or five months. Recently
kept a “ tiger,” a “ brown,” and two “ diamonds,
which remained respectively seven, nine, ten, and
eleven months without food. At the end of
eleven months the smaller of the “diamonds
(2ft. long) received a mouse, after which it had
nothing more till date of death, four months after.
Also, snakes do not invariably swallow their prey
head-first (“C.F.”B. 8/7/’99), though they usually
do so. My larger “diamond” had his mouth
torn several times through taking in pigeons
wrong end foremost.
ON THEIR HONEYMOON IN THE WILD WEST.
Brisbane has lately been inundated with
a small flood of bogus silver coins, and the effect
on church collections has been simply disastrous.
Strange that orthodox people should actually
fancy they can thus cheat the Almighty. It re-
calls the Chinese custom of putting spurious coins
instead of genuine ones into the coffins of the dead
—in the belief that the hapless corpse won’t know
the difference.
At Whangamumu, M.L., where a. Captain
Cook catches whales by stretching a titanic net
across a narrow strait between an island and the
main land, nine whales have already been
slaughtered this season. The fish have, according
to Maori tradition, used this strait from time
immemorial in their periodical journeys from
north to south, being attracted to it, it is pre-
sumed, by the facilities its rocky shores afford for
relieving their bodies of barnacles. The strait is
so narrow that when once in, the monsters cannot
turn ; the net, buoyed with barrels, baulks them
and they are speedily killed with harpoon and
lance. Near Whangamumu is the site of an
ancient Maori battlefield. The place is a strict
tapu and the skeletons of over 100 slaughtered
warriors lie just as they fell under the mere
stroke and spear-thrust.

A DEPARTING DIRGE.
Girls in town and boys out back,
I’ve rolled up my little pack,
And on June’s chill wintry gales
Sail from pleasant New South Wales.
Ere I go—a doggerel song
To bid the whole caboose “ So-long 1"
Saddle-gear and horses sold—
Fetched but scanty stock of gold—
Scanty 11 yet the whole d d lot
Publicans and Flossies got.
Since I in this country landed
Ne’er before was I so “ stranded.”
Now I’m leaving Sydney’s shore
Harder up than e’er before ;
A keen appetite I feel
To taste a bit o’ British veal ;
And let’s trust, across the foam
They have a fatted calf at home.
From duns and debts (once safe on board)
Pray deliver me, oh Lord 1
Here’s the burden of my song :
“ Good-bye, old girl ! Old chap, So-long! ”
Hardest loss of all I find
To leave the good old horse behind.

London, June 16.—Hospital Sunday witnessed a new device for lightening the
sorrows and comforting the souls of sufferers in hospitals.
'Hie electrophone has been fitted to some of the London hospitals.
Last Sunday the Chelsea Hospital for Women and the Dreadnought Seamen’s
Hospital at Greenwich were able to listen to the services being held at some of our
leading places of worship.
Nor was the privilege confined to those sound in limb, for a special arrange-
ment keeps the hearing-cups in position close to the ears, and thus enables
those with broken arms or otherwise unable to move to enjoy the elec-
trophone. There was, of course, a choice of creeds, including
Church of England, Wesleyan, Presbyterian and Jewish.
Thus Canon Fleming was able to sav
belore beginning his sermon : “ While I
am speaking for the sick and suffer-
ing, some of them are listening.”
And while he was speaking to the
listening most of them were suffering.

Having an effect on the schools in Otago. A number of teachers have reported that
there seems to be no prospect of an increased attendance for s,ome years, as there
are no young children in their districts, and very few births are reported. In 12
schools the board Las dismissed a teacher from each, and seven others have been
notiiied that the staff will be reduced if there is-no increase in the attendance.”

SUNDAY OBSERVANCE.
“ There are a number of motions on . the
order paper of the Legislative Assembly * for
the introduction of bills dealing with Sunday
observance. Mr. Griffith has now started a new
phase of the question. The hon. member pro-
poses to bring in a bill to amend the Town Police
Act “in so far as it prohibits the playing of
wholesome athletic sports on Sundays.”
There will be a patent self-acting plate
Which will spring from the wall at the right

Ed. Bulletin. — In a recent issue you pub-
lished two paragraphs re the cyanide patent, both of which
begin with a garbled statement. The first states that the
action of the N.S.W. Examiner of Patents in refusing the
Ovanide Co.’s application for permission to amend brings.
N.S.W. into line with Victoria. This is the reverse of
fact, for in Victoria the permission stands as granted by
the verdict of a majority of the final deciding local
authority, the Full Court, while in N.S.W. permission,
has been refused by the administrator of the Patents
Department, the deciding authority in the first in-
stance. It is to be hoped that all obstructions
to the path of the patentees in an appeal to the
Privy Council will be removed in N. S. Wales. In
W.A., Q., and Tas., the amendment of the patent has
been allowed. As to the Transvaal, it ought to be said
that a majority of the Supreme Court disallowed the
amendment, and to obtain even a minority there in such
an issue was a moral victory for the Uitlanders. Again,
it is not pretty generally admitted that the knowledge of
cyanogen’s power to separate gold was common property
fifty years ago. No such thing has ever been admitted.
It was known that cyanogen would dissolve gold, and that
solutions of gold in cyanogen were commonly used in
electrolysis as in the process of plating. No one, until
M‘Arthur and Forrest came along, ever suggested that
cyanogen solutions would separate or disentangle gold
from its ores. Two or three little inventors had suggested
that cyanide and something else might be put in solution
for the purpose, but their ideas were never seriously con-
sidered. M‘Arthur and Forrest were not only the first to
patent the practical method, but the first to absolutely
separate or disentangle gold from its ores by means of
cyanide solutions. — Fred. Walsh.
[The Bulletin is well aware there is no end to
discussion on this matter, particularly among interested
parties. Mr. Walsh admits that it was known before the
Macarthur-Forrest patent that cyanogen would dissolve
gold, and that it was commonly used for that purpose ;
but denies that.it was known that cyanogen would separate
gold. The distinction is a fine one, and the justification
of the distinction is a matter of opinion. Anyway, J. A.
Parkes, known as the inventor of a process for taking
silver from lead, gave good evidence to show he knew
cyanogen’s separating properties as far back as 1852.
Macarthur and Forrest are entitled to all the practical
credit of the invention ; but they didn’t discover the
germ-idea—they only applied it.]

The Colonial Sugar Refining Co. has notified
Clarence River growers that it will buy cane fit for cutting
before the end of 1901 under rates in present contract
provided that the Federal tariff—if in existence before
that period—shall ensure a duty of not less than £3 per
ton on sugar. In event of reduction of duty below £3,
price of cane will be also reduced 2s. per ton for each £1
of such reduction. No mention, however, is made of any
higher price for cane if the Federal tariff sugar-duty shall
be higher than the £3 per ton on which present contracts
are based, yet it is 20 to 1 that it will be higher. What
about an increase of 4s. per ton of cane if the i eaerai
sugar tariff is £5 a ton ?

Judge Conolly (M.L.) recently ruled that col-
lusive failure to pay calls, in order to enable a co. to go

If, as would appear, the indefatigable Mr.
Cairnes, B.N.S.W. manager at Parramatta, has discovered
a method of perfectly preserving passion-fruit for oversea
export, another very considerable source of revenue has
been found for Australian orchardists.

The B.H. mines’ timber-bills are small affairs
now compared with what they used to be when the
square-set system was alone employed. In 1891, £302,000
worth of timber was put on the mines. Last half-year,
though three times more ore was extracted from under-
ground, the total quantity imported to B.H. was valued
.at £41,085.

The successful concentration of Broken Hill
sulphides and the establishment of a market for “ zincs”
have turned attention to some old silver-lead “ shows ” in
:S.A. —the province which, before Broken Hill, had most
success with silver. The cos. abandoned their claims
when they got to sulphides, though in places the silver
contents were above Barrier average. The most pro-
mising occurences are in the hills S.W. of Adelaide, close
to the Melb. railway line.
* * * *
Suoh fine concentrating work can now be done
that, in consequence of the rise in the price of copper,
tailings containing only 2 per cent, of metal are being
profitably worked at old Cornish mines.
A great check might be put upon the littering
of wild cats on the market if there were a law that vendors
should only be allowed ordinary shares (no cash), while
shares issued to the public should be preferential as to
■dividends, up to, say, 10 per cent. —and altogether pre-
ferential as to capital. In other words, vendors’ shares
would carry no divs. till the public’s shares had got their
10 per cent. Out of further profits, vendors would get up
to 10 per cent. —and, if there were any balance, all shares
would participate on equal terms. If the co. went into
liquidation, the public would get first whack at the assets.
Vendors should not get cash, because they claim so hea,vily,
as a rule, and swamp the property ; also because it relieves
them of all responsibility as to the future of the mine, or
as to the lies in the prospectus. If they want to realise,
they can sell their ordinary shares, and this means of
raising money will not interfere with the cash directly
raised by the public for working the mine or whatever it
is. The system would be a real test of the bona-fides of
vendors. The man who swears that his property is a sure
fortune, but won’t take a share in the fortune in payment,
would simply be knocked out.

Boulder Brookman’s gift of =£lo,ooo to Adelaide
School of Mines had unexpected results. It set men
thinking of the time, only a very few years back, when
Brookman was handing sugar and jam over the counter,
and of the great things that have come to him through
being a “first robber”; and pious Adelaide has been
leaving home by the first train in order to lie in wait for
a hairy person with a slug sticking out of his pocket, so
that it might be a “first robber,” too. Everything that
has at any time been vaguely suspected of being a mine
has either been repegged or is being shepherded ; and the
gentleman who has been for the last two or three years
carrying vegetables round the suburbs blossoms once
more into “ Captain Tom Tresomething, the well-known
mining man,” or words to that effect. To one of which
“ Captains,” by the way, an awful thing happened lately.
An “ influential syndicate ” had sent him out after a
copper “show.” He wired next day—“ Found property.
Green carbonates showing in outcrop. Forwarding speci-
mens.” The specimens came, with the “ green carbon-
ates” considerably damaged—they consisted of a sun-
dried coating of moss 1
* * * *
“ Spotter ”: Notwithstanding the ill-fortune
English capitalists have experienced in the wild cats of
W.A. goldfields it is astonishing to find how they still
allow themselves to be gulled in connection with the
timber industry. The manner in which the timber mills
are managed (or mismanaged) is scarcely credible Dor
instance, a mill, recently erected employed 11 hands
at the benches, &c., and to guard the interests of the
capitalist the following: staff (management and clerical)
is engaged, viz., a managing director at £l5OO per annum,
a general manager at £6OO, a timekeeper at £lBO, a mill-
foreman at 4 200. For log-hauling two teams are em-
ployed, and for foiling two men, with a boss at a wage of
£lBO per annum to direct them. Take the actual workers
at the mill, their wages in 12 months total £l4OO, whilst
local management costs £2480 ! ! The truck system comes
to the rescue here, and only for the swindle thus worked
on the men few of the timber mills of W.A. could show
a profit.

The Bulletin office often has a lot of ore in
sight, and though the practice of sending it in has never
been encouraged, this paper receives too many requests
for gratuitous assays and opinions as to value and treat-
ment of samples submitted. Arrangements have now
been made for testing, by assay and otherwise, samples of
ore, provided the sum of £1 is sent with each to cover
cost. Assays alone do not serve the miner s purpose,
hence certificates supplied to Bulletin correspondents
will not only give a statement of metallic contents
owners will be advised by an experienced, practical metal-
lurgist as to the best methods of treating the ore in bulk,
whether by wet or dry crushing and amalgamation, smelt-
ing, cyaniding, chlorinating, etc. Parcels should not be
less than lib. nor more than 101 b.

The lack of carriers is entirely due to the‘selfishness of

by shanghai-ing them—bluffing them they are going to

any miner to come to this country with less than £100.”

FOR YEARS.
“ 8 Watson-street, Burton-on-Trent,
“ Staffordshire, England.
“ Mr. W. G. Hearne, Geelong.—
“Dear Sir, —
Your letter and Bronchitis Cure to hand quite safe.
I am sure you will be glad to know that your Bronchitis
Cure has quite cured me. I was very glad when it came,
as 1 was suffering from a severe attack of Bronchitis at the
time it arrived. I had sent for my own doctor, but had
not had one night s rest for a week. I started taking the
Bronchitis Cure three times a day as directed, and was
very much eased at once. At the end of a week I only
took it twice a day, and then only every night for a
week, as I was so much better when, thanks to the Lord
for adding His blessing, I was quite well, and walked into
town and back without feeling any fatigue. I had not
done that previously for 12 monl hs—always went in the
omnibus—as walking caused me such pain and distress in
the chest. I always walk now, and never feel it, and I
am stronger than I have been for years. I thank my son
for his great kindness in sending the medicine, and am,
dear Sir,
“Yours very truly,
“M. MORTIMER.”
Extract from a letter, since written by the same lady to
her son, Mr. John S. Mortimer, Llenwellyn, Katunga,
Victoria.
HER DAUGHTER HAD BEEN VERY ILL.
SPITTING UP BLOOD.
THE DOCTOR SAID NOTHING MORE COULD BE
DONE.
CURED BY HEARNE S BRONCHITIS CURE.
The extract runs as follows :—“ As for myself, thank
the Lord, lam feeling stronger than I have for years. I
had an attack of Bronchitis in November, but IJearne’s
Bronchitis Cure was again successful. I feel quite well,
and walk into town feeling quite strong.
“ I must ask you to send tne six bottles more of the
medicine, as 1 wish to have a supply in the house. I
have tried to get it made up here, and let my chemist
have a bottle to see what he could do. He tells me this
week he can make nothing out of it, he never saw any-
thing like it before, so there is only one thing for me to
do—send for more. I have never kept in bed one day
since I commenced to take it. I used to be in bed a fort-
night at a time always, and after that for months I was
as weak as I could possibly be, and was always taking
cod liver oil, so you will see at once it is quite worth
while sending for it such a long distance.
“ Something more I must tell you. Charlotte has been
very ill since I wrote you. Her cough was so bad she
never had a night's rest, and was spitting up blood
very much. The doctor told her husband that there was
nothing more he could do for her. So on the Sunday I
sent her half a bottle of the Bronchitis Cure, and told
her to try it, and if she did not use it, not to waste it,
but send it back again. She had such confidence in her
doctor that I thought she would not try it. On the
Wednesday I sent over again, and she was much better,
the night’s rest was very good, and cough and bleeding
from the lungs better. She sent for another half-bottle,
and on the following Sunday sent over to say that she
was quite cured and did not require any more medicine.
So you see what great good it has done, and she wishes
to have some with my next supply.”

THIS company is being formed for the purpose of acquiring and working, by means of a bucket-
dredge of the latest and most approved type, a gold-mining area of 96 acres situated on the
Shoalhaven River, about six miles from Braidwood.
The property is held by virtue of an application for a Special Lease for gold-mining purposes,
made in terms of the Mining Act Further Amendmeut Act, 1884, the application being approved
and gazetted on 20th January, 1899. It embraces over a mile of the riverbed and beaches,
and varies from four to fifteen chains in width. Mr. Wilson, who had come over from New Zealand
for the purpose of securing a dredging proposition, selected the ground in June, 1898, as the best
available site on the Shoalhaven River.
The reports of Mr. C. E. Richardson, M-E., late manager of the Manorburn Gold Dredging Co.,
Ltd. of Alexandra, New Zealand, and of Mr. John W. H. Piper, C.E., together with a sketch plan
of the property proposed to be acquired, can be obtained at the office of the company.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Some extremist might fetch up to date Dr.
Lang’s book on “ The Coming Event, Freedom
and Independence for Australia,” published in
London, 1870.
The first Colonial Secretary of N.S.W.,
appointed in 1825, drew a salary of <£2ooo a year.
And the country was poorer then than now. But
it was England that fixed the amount.
The total number of affirmative votes
cast for the Commonwealth Bill is now 335,000;
the noes only total 110,000. An awkward fact to
tack on to that petition to “ the foot of the
throne.”
By its new Electoral Bill, reducing the
Assembly to 32 and the Council to 16 members,
Tasmania takes the lead of the Australian pro-
vinces in framing its local legislation to stand
proportioned to Federal legislation.
The very fact of “ ten-bob ” Unmack
yapping against Federation should be sufficient
inducement to the whole of the bush-workers of
Queensland — i.e., those of them fortunate enough
to have a vote—to support the Bill baldheaded.
Notified in a recent Q. Govt. Gazette
that Premiers Braddon, Kingston, Reid, Turner
and Seddon have been appointed J.’sP. for Banana-
land, John Forrest being one already. Is this an
indication of how the Federal wind blows down
J. R. Dickson’s neck ?
J ames’s motion in favor of woman suffrage
in Westralia was enthusiastically carried in the
Assembly by 17 votes to 6. Westralia has the
smallest proportion of females in the Seven Pro-
vinces, and the female population is proportion-
ately smallest on the goldfields—for the ’tother-
sider generally left his “missus” behind in the
East—and largest in the old agricultural districts.
So female suffrage will greatly strengthen the old
Sandgroper minority when the inevitable redistri-
bution of seats comes along.
SIGNS OF THE DROUGHT.
VOICE FROM THE DOOR : “ Now, then, Alexander,
mar says yer ter ’urry hup out of that there
bath, and not to hempty the water, ’cause there’s
Mary Jane, Amelia, and little Willie to have
’em after you!”
Dalby (Q.) stock-growers lately complained
bitterly because £4OOO worth of stock was refused
admission into N.S.W. for fear of tick. What
sort of yell will there be if Queensland rejects
.r ederation, and finds all its stock permanently
walled out of all the southern provinces by an
inexorable tariff barrier ?
Only one bold attempt was made in Mel-
bourne to hold an anti-Bill meeting— at Colling-
wood, a Democratic centre which recorded 1100
votes against the Bill in 1898. Holman, M.L.A.
Higgins and Hancock addressed the gathering
and announced that the meeting denounced the
B'll by a 500 majority. At the poll the week
after Collingwood voted: aye, 2018 ; no, 231.
No less than 185 business men of New-
castle have petitioned against the Sydney morning
papers getting the gratis early-morning news-
paper train to the North that these rich, tough
mendicants have been begging for. Newcastle
considers that the Sydney papers should pay for
their own train if they want one.
At Johannesburg a meeting of thousands
of Uitlanders cheered wildly the suggestion that
British troops should be sent in to smash the
Boers. They were most eager to fight by proxy.
At Paarde Xraal thousands of Boers cheered the
declaration that they would go out and shoot and
be shot themselves, and do the fighting in their
own proper persons.
Sydney Sunday Shellback will evidently
have to carry its anti-Federal agitation “to the
foot of the throne” on its own, unless John
Haynes and David Storey can be counted in ; and
the said agitation is limping along very painfully.
At present it seems a matter for conjecture if it
will ever reach the foot of Bridge-street on its
way to Circular Quay.
Premier Forrest actually told W.A. Assem-
bly that “ he was awaiting the (Federation) Bills
from Queensland and Victoria to ascertain the
form in which it was placed before these Parlia-
ments. John seems unable to realise that all the
eastern Parliaments are dealing with exactly the
same Bill, and that it must be the same to a word
if there is going to be any Federation.
Premier Turner jumped with both feet on
the suggestion that Minister Taverner should
prolong his sojourn among the dukes and
duchesses by acting as Vic. Agent-General whilst.
Andrew Clarke is away from the London office.
The newly electro-plated Minister of Agriculture
has been instructed to tear himself away from
Britain’s proud nobility and return to work.
The Queensland Geebungs are persistently
barking that Federation means being swallowed
up by N.S.W., which is awkward in view of the
tons of printed statements by N.S. W. Geebungs
that the small-population provinces, of which
Queensland is one, were going to have a real good
time looting Sydney in particular, and all N.S. W.
generally. Verily the way of the snake-yarn man
is hard!
The total votes in the four provinces
which have now accepted the Commonwealth Bill
were, in 1898: For, 214,000; Against, 108,000.
This year the ayes have jumped to 335,000, while
the noes have remained practically stationary.
N.S.W. polled 34,000 more in favor of the Bill
Victoria 50,000, and S.A. 30,000. All in 12 short
months ; increases plainly indicative of the rising
of the tide of Australian sentiment.
It is quite an undertaking to use a
franked envelope in Wesfcralia. One re-
cently sent from Perth to Fremantle is
before us. In addition to “On Her
Majesty’s Service,” the following is
printed on the top right-hand corner :
“ This envelope can only be lawfully used
by Railways Departments (sic) on the
public business. The use of it by public
officials to avoid payment of postage on
postal matter of any kind is punishable,
and involves the letter being charged
double postage. The public are cautioned
against using it under any circumstances.”
Then there is a, large frank stamp with
some official’s initials, a rubber-stamp to
show the branch of the dept., then two
Perth P.O. stamps and, finally, a regis-
tered-letter stamp. .
Through the expiration of leases,
15,000,000 acres in N.S.W. Central Divi-
sion will revert to the State in June, 1900.
Of these, 1,000,000 are classed as first,
3,000,000 as second-class, and the remain-
der stands as poor. The first and second
lots should certainly go to agricultural set-
tlement, and perhaps a portion of the
remainder. Nor, despite some Parlia-
mentarians, should such a gigantic pro-
perty be left wholly to the disposal of an
incapable Crown' Minister like Mr.
Young The issues are big enough for the
entire Cabinet and Parliament.
Nelson declared the other day in
Bananaland Council that black-labor will
undoubtedly be blocked at an early date
by the Federal Parliament. Hence Fede-
ration will be an unmitigated ourse.
Certain alleged Q.- democratic organs
aver, on the other hand, that Federation
will signify the continuance of black-labor. Hence
Federation will be doubly an unmitigated curse.
Minister Chataway’s organ in Mackay denounces
Federation. Chataway himself now does the
double shuffle, and says he doesn’t mind it so very
much, after all. Public feeling in was
too much for him.
Not pleasant for democratic S.A. to reflect
that Bigjohn Forrest defends, or at least palliates
the unequal representation of Westralian elector-
ates by references to S.A. conditions. He draws
a deputation’s attention to the fact that East
Torrens has 14,000 electors and the Northern Ter-
ritory 900, and yet, he remarks, nobody screams at
Kingston. But he merely shows thereby that
Kingston should be screamed at.
The utterly unexpected record Federal-
vote in Victoria was a facer for Melb. Age. That
paper gave no help to the Bill, and, beyond a few
references to the meetings, took but little notice
of the campaign. On the eve of the referendum a
message was sent from the Age office to Sydney
Telegraph that it was not expected the polling
would be as heavy as last year. Therefore the
Age, which never really sympathised with Fede-
ration, and was dragged along at the heels of the
Australian Natives’ Association, can take no part
in the rejoicings over the result.
A curse from Far North :
That naked hypocrite and unparalleled liar, Brisbane
Telegraph, keeps roaring to its readers that the Com-
monwealth Bill is a ghoulish Tory measure framed bv
resplendent boodlers to rob the horny-handed of his
birthright and liberty. Now—to reiterate for the mil-
lionth time—the Bill makes both houses of Parliament
elective on a one-man -one-vote franchise ; gives every
man a chance of political distinction—or the other thing
—by paying members of both Houses, and recognises the
democratic principle of majority rule. And the loath-
some and illiterate Telegraph is the bulwark of pluto-
cracy and the plural vote ; and audaciously advocates the
abolition of payment of members and invariably gets mad
at the mere mention of the horrid Labor-partv. If the
democracy of Piebaidland follows the Telegraph’s advice
it richly deserves whatever happens to it.
TRUE GREATNESS.
S HE: “ The lines of this hand show that you have
never done anything truly remarkable or note-
worthy to make your name ring throughout
the land.”
FARMER BROWN (proudly): “ You’re clean out of
it, mum—clean out of it. I took special prize
for finest pumpkins at the Big Cow Flat
Show!”
Moran, M.L.A., solemnly warns W.A.
not to federate because “as soon as the duties and
bounties were swept away the Collie (W.A.) coal
might find it a hard job to compete with the New-
castle article.” Moran, to all appearance, really
doesn’t know that his province has no coal duty or
coal bounty to sweep away; and the Collie coal
on the spot can beat the coal that has to pay 2000
miles of sea-freight by ss. in the ton any day.
Collie coal would knock Newcastle out of the
W.A. market in a week if the ’Groper had energy
enough to dig it out.
The return of Henry Turley as Federal
and Labor candidate for South Brisbane (Q.) came
as a sickening surprise to the anti-Federalists in
the Q. metropolis. Jones, the Ministerial and
parochial aspirant, was most lavishly backed by
anti-Feaeral funds, and the electorate was de-
luged in his interests with panic pamphlets and
plaintive appeals to the working men to save
themselves from destruction. The deranged
Telegraph backed Jones, and all the provincial-
ists within a radius of a hundred miles were quar-
tered in the electorate, and barracked night and
day for their man. And the result is that the
head-quarters of anti-Federalism in Q. has voted
Federation and taken a Federal Labor-man in
preference to an anti-Fed. Ministerialist.
Hugh Nelson, who used to gibe at the
demand for Separation, and say that such towns
as Townsville and Rockhampton oughtn’t to exist
at all, is stricken with a grievous fit of sympathy
for the lot of the hapless Centralians who are
going to be blighted by Federation. The ex-
Premier draws the attention of Central-district
folks to the fact that their 57,000 inhabitants will
only entitle them to one member and a fraction in
the Federal Lower House —whence all manner of
trouble is predicted. The Centralians, however,
may be comforted by the fact that every other
57,000 folk throughout the length and breadth of
Australia are afflicted with precisely the same sort
of grievance. Nelson’s great alleged grief is that
Central Queensland will get just the same repre-
sentation in the Federal Lower House as any
other place of equal population.
The victory of Turley (Labor-Federation-
ist) for South Brisbane in the first place showed
that the Q. Labor folks vote solidly for their man,
be he Federationist or otherwise. Secondly, it
was a terrible slap in the face for the S. Brisbane
anti-Federalists, who were confident of the easiest
of victories. Then, again, the contest provided a
magnificent joke. Turley protested against Rock-
hampton being appointed a polling-place for S.
Brisbane. The protest was disregarded. At the
close of the local poll each man had received ex-
actly 1168 votes. Everybody was waiting in
breathless expectation for the outside returns.
Suddenly a telegram arrived—nine votes for Tur-
ley from Rockhampton; none for his opponent.
And the Government went home, tore its raiment,
put ashes on its head, and cursed the property-
vote unto seventy thousand times seven.
Carruthers, N.S.W.’s new Treasurer, made
an unspeakable show of himself with his com-
plaint that the Auditor-General “was not right
in reviving these old deficits of years gone by and
publishing them to the colony as a new fact.’’
The Auditor-General, in his annual report,
always states what the total deficit amounts to up
to date ; he couldn’t give a true account of the
finances if he didn’t, and it isn’t a new fact, but
an old, regular fact of long standing. The real
trouble is, that this independent and non-party
authority makes the deficit a great deal larger
than the Reid .Govt., in its anxiety to whitewash
its own financial methods, has always represented,
and he shows it to be really larger now than when
Reid took office. Treas. Carruthers apparently
has a grievance because the A.-G. doesn’t sup-
press facts which look bad for the Reid Ministry.
Premier Forrest’s proposed tax of Is. in th&
L on Westrahan dividends moved Western Mail
v5 e et h) »°i K)1 ln £ fui T ; it points out that it will
be the absolutely unheard-of amount, except in
■“I 0 jy ar > °f in the. £,” and asks wildly if
eis any income-tax in the British empire ”
at all resembling this horror. r lhe Westralian
press is so isolated and so blankly ignorant of
everything away from Swan River that this
metropolitan paper probably never heard that
Queensland and Tasmania have had the Is. in the £
dividend-tax for years ; that Maoriland levies Is.
m the £ on the net income of all public companies
(not only on dividends but also on sums carried to.
reserve), and that on large incomes derived from
property S.A. charges Is. in the £ and Victoria
Is. 4d. in the £ income-tax. Over in the West
they actually fancy that Forrest invented tl.o
dividend-tax.
Dear Bulletin.— Gympie (Q.) Truth is
against the present Commonwealth Bill because
it it is accepted by a referendum taken on the pre-
sent restricted Queensland franchise “it will im-
pose a constitution on tens of thousands who can
have no voice in accepting or rejecting.” Yet
suppose a Queensland Parliament (necessarily
elected on the present restricted franchise) passed
a new Queensland Constitution making both
Mouses elective by one-adult-one-vote—that would
also impose on these tens of thousands a constitu-
tion which they would have no voice in accepting
or rejecting. If you give woman the franchise
■^i? U on her a new political system which
she has no voice in accepting or rejecting. The
Gympie paper’s logic is that a person who hasn't a
vote now shouldn’t get a vote unless he had a
vote before he got a vote so that he could say bv
his vote whether he wanted a vote or aot.—T.
Salt.
Speaker Abbott regards it as a sign of tliG
degeneration of NS. W. Parliament that such a
term as “ damned liar ” should have found its way
into Hansard. But Hansard is supposed to be
an accurate record of what goes on in Parliament,
and if Speaker Abbott has let the Assembly drift
into such chaos that members call each other
damned liars without fear of consequences, then the
fact ought to be officially reported. The Speaker
also complains that the habit of interjection has
gone so far that last session one member was
interrupted 47 times in 23 minutes. Hansard
reports that sort of thing also—and quite rightly
—to let Speaker .Abbott see what things have
drifted to under his control. Hansard ought to
go further, and report what members do as well
as what they say. “ Here the hon. member for
Boggabri shook his unclean fist at the hon. mem-
ber for Boggabilla ” mightn’t look well, but it
would at least make the record more accurate.
“CASTLES IN THE AIR.”
“ Buggins ” writes from Perth (W.A.)
Your correspondent, “ T’othersider’s,” remarks may be
permitted to pass as approximately correct, with the
exception of what he says about Vosper. Re this noto-
riety-hunting individual we are assured that he is “doing
a little harm and very much good for the Commonwealth
Bill.” Well, let’s see ? After posing for some time as an
out-and-out champion of the Bill, the erratic owner of
the long hair suddenly confronted the public with a
lightning change into the character of a conditional
Federationist. It is this individual, and not our
native Groper Government, who is responsible for
those demands of a trans-continental railway to
Freeman tie, a dock, and other parish-pump details.
Yosper’s brilliant idea of obtaining these is by petition-
ing the Imperial Parliament to insert the necessary
clauses in the Bill when it goes to 'England! Of course,
all this was right into the hands of the local “ antis”
who welcomed Yosper into their camp with much jubila-
tion. There he remains, and now each issue of his self-
advertisement—the Sunday Times— is full of labored
attempts to justify his position. The cause of Vosper's
break-away from the Federal party is simply offended
vanity. He aimed at being chosen leader of the move-
ment, and when he found his long hair wasn't going to
stream in the van, his colossal self-conceit was so hurt
that he at once set about doing his best to wreck the
movement. He will have to reckon, however, with his
goldfields constituents, who are ardent federationists to
a man, and who, though somewhat nonplussed for the
present by the vagaries of their representative, are not
likely to stand by and see him play into the hands of
their natural enemies—the old Gropers. Vosper’s latest
move was to induce Labor-member Thomas, of Broken
Hill, to come to W.A. to try and prejudice the workers-,
against Federation. However, as the defects in the Com-
monwealth Bill, according to Thomas, are precisely those
concessions to the smaller States which favor Westralia,
his objections are not likely to carry much weight here.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The football-match, England v. N.S.W., on
Sydney Cricket Ground last Saturday did not reach the
Standard anticipated, nor was the attendance (14,000) tip
to expectations. Local team played one short during
three-parts of the game, throutrh Galloway retiring with
a badly-injured collar-bone. The match was compara-
tively tame, ami lacked speed. Little more than 15min.
after starting Barton (.V.S.\V.) secured a try, and Spragg
converted : 5-nil. Half-time saw no change. The Eng-
lishmen shone during second-half, and made things hmn
by forcing matters. From a penalty kick, just outside
25, Adamson (Eng.), smin. after resumption, notched 3.
Subsequently N.S. W. was atrain penalised (same player,
O’Donnell, beimr in fault), and 3 more points were re-
corded, though this goal should not have been allowed
through the kicker, Adamson, placing the hall. With
the figures England 6, N.S.W. 5, play waxed warm for a
while till Swannel (Eng.) gained a hard-fought-for try,
and Adamson converted, making totals England 11,
N.S.W. 5. The struggle ceased a little later.' English
backs and N.S.W. forwards did the best work. Britisher
Adamson s goal-kicking was a revelation. Ail three
goals were exceedingly difficult, hut every one went as
accurately over the centre as if fired from a gun, just
skimming the bar in each instance. The visitors have
improved a heap since last in Sydney, and will probably
be still better in the next two test-matches.
* * * •
Their brilliant back division won the Britishers
the game against N.S.W. on Saturday, and apparently
no amount of experience will convince the selectors that
what is wanted in the Australian teams are some fast for-
wards able to swoop flown on said hacks and bustle them
a bit. Men like Nicholls and Bucher can, if not flurried,
always gain 50 or 60.vd. hv a kick, and as there was no
one to flurry them in the N.S.VV. team, they were able to
keep the play well down on the opposite line. And if you
keep the play there the chances to score come t hemselves.
Following-np is a heart-breaking game, but it is a game
that wins a lot of matches.
* • m m
The. long-kicking which has been such a feature
of the English Rugby team during its tour recalls the im-
mense superiority of the local kicking in the Australian
game. . In Melbourne and Adelaide nearly every senior
plater is good for a kick of 60yds. or more on a still day,
anti to one used to the Australian game, the kicking of
average Rugby footballers seems execrable.
* * • •
Young Victor Trumper, in the match against
Sussex last week, earned lasting fame, and pleased thou-
sands of Australian admirers, by topping with 300 not
£!JL Mur,loch ’ s rec °id f°r an Australian in England
(286) notched 17 years ago. Notable that both feats were
accomplished on Brighton ground, which favors quick
run-getting. Trumper has now passed his thousand and
Nobles aggregate (1238), scoring 1279 for 30 completed
innings.
• * * •
IVTelb. Argus, like other patriotic journals, got
itself into a.fangle last week re the heavy scoring against
the Australian Eleven. Said the Aimes man on Saturday t
If our bowling alone were off, our batsmen, having so
much the best of the three-figure scores earlier in the
summer, should at least he holding their own now, I
fear that moans general staleness, from which batsmen,
bowlers, and fieldsmen alike are suffering.'’ It didn’t
need an. Australian onslaught on the Sussex bowling to
make this look ridiculous. Bowler Jones has been rested
from time to time all through the season, and howler
Noble proved that he wasn’t stale by hatting splendidly
fourth test-match, where the Englishmen made
their first noteworthy stand. Also, bowler Truinble
scored well in the same match.
• • • •
With little pars., of this sort Australian cricket
scribes try to discredit the English arrangement of three-
day matches. The Argus man writes Three-day
games serve the weak counties well. A case in point was
a match between Sussex and Notts. Sussex led by 347
to 180 in the first innings, but in the second innings of
Notts, Gunn and Shrewsbury played for the draw, and not
it— the former scoring 150, the latter 114.” Why not say
that they played for the score, which in this case caused
the draw? The two Notts, veterans are notoriously
slower batsmen than the average pro., it is tru.e, but it is
absurd to say that in making 264 runs between them
they were batting against time.
For the sake of argument, let us say, three-day
games serve the weaker team well. A case in point was
the fourth test-match. England led by 372 to 196 in the
first, innings; but in second innings of the Australians
Noble, Trumper, Worrall, and others played to save the
game, and were successful, although the two highest
individual scores were only 89 and 60.
* * • *
One of the most striking coincidences connected
with cricket is that concerning Jack Lvons and recent
test-matches. The service the great siniter has done to
Australian cricket is well known, but in ’94-5, and a<u»in
in ’97-8, he proved a regular Jonah. In the former
season, Lyons was only a shade past his best, having been
oqe of the stars of the ’93 tour in England. lie played in
three test-matches and stood out of two ; Australia lost
those three and won those two I When Stoddart’ssecond
team came along, Lyons was still dangerous, as Victoria
and N.S.W. found, that season. He was given one test-
match and stood out of four. Australia lost that one,
and won those four. Such is luck t
* * • *
“ The smartest thing in the second test-match,”
writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent, “ was
Kelly's stumping of Townsend. The batsman's toe
scratched in and out of the crease like a streak, but too
late. MacLaren was not in good enough form for Jones
the first day; Jessop, being a slogger, has no nerves; Jack-
son with all his side is a clinker, but the others were
palsied, arid Jonah bowled like condensed Sheol. Dar-
ling’s batting is, as expected, hampered by his responsi-
bilities ; Worrall wanted to hit too early ; Hill’s 135 is
■ debited with three chances, but two of them would he
safe to miss disaster 99 times in 100. Trumper was the
gem, and he’ll be near the angels by, the time the averages
are totalled. Noble is earning unqualified praise for his
awful earnestness. It must he said that the press
unanimously gave the highest credit and praise to ‘ Our
Boys ’ for their win.
* * * *
The Hinglish press must be just now engaged
in trying to account for the sudden disappearance of the
“ funk” which seemed chronic with local “ crack ” bats-
men six weeks ago. Cricket scribes at that time held
out no hope of the Australian howling getting “col-
lared,” or the batting “ stuck up ” ever again. The
British Lion, with his tail between his legs, was denounc-
ing himself as a played-out impostor, although-the Aus-
tralians had not shone move brilliantly than some pre-
vious teams. It was their workmanlike way of winning
at the right end of the game that had established the
“funk.” The third test, wherein Hearne performed the
hat-trick on Noble, Gregory, and Clem Hill, infused new
spirit into poor old England, and what with Clem going
wrong in the nose, and Jones getting off color, and a
change in the luck of the toss, the Australians were put
on the defensive. Since July 17 four innings of over
350 runs and six individual “centuries” have been
scored against them. Let us pray for a splendid revival
of Clem Hill and Jones, for they were the fellows who
scared All-England in the first and second tests. The
two South Australians, with Noble, Trurnper, and
Trumble, have done all the good work for the team when
it was most needed. Billowell's. capture of 10 Surrey
wickets for 23 runs was a mere waste of strength, and his
“form” at critical times has been disappointin'', as a
rule.
• * » *
Why doesn’t Darling give Svd. Gregory a
fortnight’s rest in the pavilion, and tnke'“ three days off”
himself meanwhile? Worrall could skipper for one match.
» * » *
Ex-sailortnan Young promises to ripen into a
famous cricketer. As a fast left-handed bowler his fault,
at present, is too much leg-break, and as a batsman he
has a free, nautical style, seemingly. When he knocked
up 40 runs for Essex against the Australians, the cable
railed it wild slogging, hut the fact t hat, he repeated the
offence in a test-match suggests a little method in his
wildness. Fora man who was all at sea until a year or
two ago these Young performances look extraordinary.

™e A.J.C’s edict that a licensed bookmaker
shall not have any interest in a betting-shop or office is
on all-fours with its puerile action re country clubs, and
has caused the toe-rag and welching section of Ikeys to
ruh their paws with glee—for does it not almost abso-
lutely leave the Sydney shop-betting Eldorado to them
and their dirty little practices, hitherto only restrained
by the presence in the game of men of standing, all of
whom hut one have now been driven off the field.
Leviathan Oxenham has refused to put up his shutters,
and has consequently forfeited the right to bet at any
meeting held within a radius of 40 miles of Sydney G.P.O.
Oxys’ absence will probabty cause a rush of the
leather-lunged from Melbourne, and thus lessen the
profits of the Sydney ring.

twice, finally twisting his neck untii his eves bulged. On
recovery, the jock rushed out and tried to buy a

shopkeeper declining to part with a “squirt” at any
price. A further fight, took place in the street on the
parties meeting later, the ex-rider being again badly
worsted. Further developments should be interesting.

The 189!) issue of Miller’s Sporting Pamphlet is
far and away the best book of its kind ever published in
Australia The old story of record performances in horse
racing and athletic sports has been carefully revised
there are some useful additions to the fund of general
sporting information, also the lists of entries for comma-
events, and the “form at a glance” of the Caulfield and
Melbourne Cup horses are typed on an improved system

The Vic. Crown will not waste any money in
prosecuting cyclist Corbett for his alleged reckless over-
throw of Bilmartin. Corbett was committed for trial
but the evidence didn’t look nearly strong enough to
sustain the criminal charge.

Melb. cycledom is bombs lie] led by the charge
levelled by E. J. Carey, of the Cycling News. He alleges
that the Martin-Walker match, advertised as being run
f ° ra JpKJP'irs'i and a side wager of £lOO (by Martin) to
£5O (by Walker) was in reality only raced for third
“cuts,” each competitor and the St, Hilda club taking an
equal share of the profits. Carey is partly right. No stakes
were put up either by club or men, but the winner got the
larger end of the two-thirds. Anyhow, the revelation
was a very unsurprising one to persons versed in sporting
lore. Purses are invariably faked or inflated, and as the
Martin-Walker match was a squarely-run contest there is
no real exposure at all. Nathless 'the league professes
great astonishment about the news it knew all along and
threatens an enquiry, which will probably end disastrously
for the competitors and the St. Kikla club.

Satisfactory to note that “ Prosper,” the favorite
whom I key Mo had striven hard to diddle, came out of
Vic. Club billiard tournament with colours flying. When
the first prize was handed over to him, he was told by the
secretary that he won it in manly style and had done
“nothing to warrant the demonstration made against
him. The fact of “ Prosper ” Graham being able to win
under the adverse circumstances went far to show why he
was such a “ good thing.” He possesses the nerve
whichits more than half the battle where billiardists of
the Vic. Club class are concerned. All ordinary Ikey Mo
for instance, is a poor perspiring coward when he gets
into “the pit” against a player who has more pluck
than himself. If the other fellow is a cool, determined
customer, with a bit the best of the handicap into the
bargain, Ike can’t make an attempt at a struggle. It was
“ Prosper s ” display of nerve in his first game which told
the books they had laid the winner, consequently
they plotted to shake his nerve, if possible, by ridiculous
protests and wild threats outside of the billiard-room and
by dirty tactics every time he took the floor for his
“ heat.” Everything calculated to interfere with the
bloomin’ favorite was tried in vain. At. the finish
The winner shouted “Fizz!” and said he'd “Nevei
played so well,”
And all that Ikey uttered was the exclamation “ ’Ell 1”

The star of whilom clever but unlucky Sydney
heavyweight, Nick (called “ Mick ”) Doolev, who dis-
puted supremacy with Australian top-notchers—Peter
Jackson, “Paddy ’ Slavin, and Joe Goddard, in turn—
continues to fall. At Kalgoorlie (W.A.), 15th ult., played-
out Tut Ryan beat Nick all the way in as tough a fight as
was ever seen on the fields. Miners suspected a schlenter
and kept away; the house was so poor that the match
would not have taken place but for someone offering £26.
Dooley should quit now. He was an at Sydney
Govt. Printing Office years ago till the fighting fit seized
him.

“Old Timer”: Newcastle (N.S.W.) heavy-
weight Bill Green is a “dead ring” for one-time man-
eating Joe Goddard, but only in appearance and build.
There’s absolutely no “devil ”in him. He's as clumsy as
a bear, has no idea of the game, and is too old to be
taught. The match between him and Stewart on Saturday
night was side-splitting and exciting, but two old washer-
women would have shaped better ; yet it was hilled “for
the championship of N.S. W.,” and this in the city that
saw world-famed Jackson, Slavin and Goddard win and
hold the title which embraced Australia. Green, blown
out by his victory over the 3st.-lighter, weak-legged
black,challenged beetle-browed, battle-worn Bill Jennings
to fight at Newcastle. Latter has a particular soft thing
on, or I'm much mistaken. Sandy Ross, jun., hankers
after the job too.
• * • *
With all their cleverness in pointing, Fitz-
simmons and Julian made one blunder in meeting Jeff-
ries. The ring was 2ft. less than the regulation square.
This gave the heavier man an advantage, as also did
Fitz.’s forcing tactics.

Shinty (hurling) has come to stay (if the law
will let it) as a Sunday afternoon attraction in Sydney.
3000 people, including many women, trained, trammed
and tramped it to Lady Robinson's Beach, on Sabbath
week, to see the “Michael Davitt” and “Robert Em-
mett” men smash heavy clubs, but trippers were “ had,”
as the Emmetts failed to materialise, and the Davitts
played a scratch-match “just for the fun of it,” and so
that nobody should be disappointed. Last day of rest
another huge crowd rolled up at same place and saw
Emmets romp over Tempe and finish up with a wild
“hurro.” Heavy spills were frequent. One burly son of
the “ ould dart ” was literally trampled upon and got up
dazed. Another had his shin opened fully 2in. ; but
these were small happenings How many people would
travel same distance (8 miles from town) to see an inter-
club match at the “ national game?” It's the spice of
roughness—probable wounds and gore—that draws, and
Shinty fairly bristles with these possibilities ; football
and fighting are simply “ not in it ” alongside hurling.

A letter from N.S.W. sculler Jim Wray, written
from Boston, says he has given up all hope of inducing
world’s-chainpion Jake Gaudaur to row,; the Canadian
will not be lured. Jim is engaged bringing out a local
crack, and expects to meet Hunter River (N.S.W.) cham-
pion Towns, now in England, as soon as the latter
recovers from his accident. Same communication tells
that Teenier, once a strong claimant for the world s
supremacy, now never sits in a boat.

As an evidence of their faith in the prosperity
of Federated Australia Massey-Harris Company Limited,
have, since the decision by referendum in N.S.W., secured
a business property on Bourke-street, between William
and King Streets, Melbourne, and have let a contract for
the erection of a large and commodious office and ware-
house premises. The building will be a handsome two-
storey and basement briek-and-stone structure 51ft. wide
x 315 ft. deep running through the block from Bourke-
street to Little Bourke-street, and fitted with every
modern convenience for handling their large and rapidly
increasing farm-implement and bicycle business. Work
has already commenced, and the premises will be ready
for occupation by November I.*

We are requested to inform Bulletin readers
that the management of the Sydney Safe Deposit (in Ash-
street, back of Paling’s, Sydney)’have decided, with a
view to popularising theuse of the safes, tooffer a special
discount of 25 per cent, to persons paying rent for two
years in advance. At present the annual rents in advance
are from two to six guineas, and the new system will
have the effect of reducing the rents to from to 4J
guineas. It has also been decided to lease safes at from
15s. per quarter and 255. per half year, a further innova-
tion.*
Pastor Bevan, of Melbourne, has adoptetv a
Yes-No policy on the tote question. Talking
of the rpachine in competition with Ikky Mo,
the plump shepherd faces both ways : “ It may
be said that the public would not be foolish
enough to risk their money on the poorer
chances which a bookmaker furnishes, hut, as I
have already remarked, the totalisator itself is
the most perfect scheme for finally netting all
the money out of the betting-public,” It doesn’t
seem to have struck the good doctor that any
human cash-taker who makes a steady profit on
his business—notably the hotelkeeper or the
tobacconist—is just as perfect a scheme for
gathering in the public boodle. Ur. Bevan’s
twaddle is pathetic. The tote claims to give
its clients a reasonable gamble on level terms
all round. Take the ease of the occasional
race-goer, who punts .£1 a time with the tote,
and assume that even 10 per cent. com. is de-
ducted. He goes 12 days a year to the races,
which means a total risk of .£72, at the rate of
six events per day. He sinks 10 per cent, of
this —£7 4s.—on the machine. If he gets the
exact amount of luck that is due to him, his
betting entertainment will cost him £144 in 20
years—say about half as much as he has spent
upon moderate drinking pleasures. The tote
is hardly more ruinous than Dr. Bevan’s offer-
tory-plate, which furnishes no fun in return for
a silver-coin contribution.

The “Kelly Gang,” according to Sydney Criterion
version, is only another illustration of the*mysterious
impulse that drives a man to start out w-ith a gun after
the othpr man who has wronged his sister. It would im-
part a flavor of originality if the management would
make Sergt. Steele, who eventually hu its the gam-

Among some new and fetching gramophone records
lately sent along from London to agent Sykes, in Me l-
bourne, there is a capital “ turn ” bv old friend Snazelb.
The voice of Snazzy is beard protesting that he doesn’t
feel equal to “The Heart Bowed Down.” He makes
a start, but after singing a few bars, he says lie
will whistle the rest, and his whistling comes out of the
funnel as fresh and larye as life. Then Snazzy siting some
more, and whistles again, and so on. Finally he wants to
know what he will get for his trouble, and lie goes away
disgusted, exclaiming “ What ! only a pint of beer ! ”
“ Texas ” : Sydney Catholic Press says Marie Narelle
is the first lady who ever received an encore at a Sydney
Amateur Orchestral Society concert. Wrong. Victoria
Young, who dfebuted at the ’96 concert, of this society,
and again sang for the amateurs in ’9B, was enthusiasti-
cally encored on both occasions. Doubtless if the C.P.
had knowoi that Miss Young (despite her name) is also a
“ true believer” the assertion would not have been made.
The late Grattan Riggs was always bored by a prattler.
The old hoy had a very slow, methodical style of conver-
sation and if casually interrupted would rise fro.il his
chair and abruptly decamp. Riggs, too, was very touchy
on the subject of his alleged ancientness. “ Fcr Go i’a
sake,” he would say to his advance agent, “ if you s ? any
of those pressmen tell them not to call me the vet., ran
Grattan Riggs.”
George Musgrove’s mother and two sisters joined him
in London lately, and a looal weekly refers to him as “a
devoted son.” Evidently Australia will see little or no
more of G.M.
A bad oversight in the Firm’s representation of
Dumas’story is the failure to account for the reappear-
ance of Miladi. Athos explains that he has carefully
hanged the wife of his bosom, and left her dangling; yet
she bobs up serenely without a word of explanation. ‘ It
.is clear that Miladi was plucked from the tree, but why
hot let her tell the tale of her rescue in a strong
soliloquy?
John Fuller, the sturdy, tuneful tenor who runs the
Myriorama Co., was originally a compositor. He and
John Hancock, the Vic. Labor member, were fellow type-
setters in the same London office.
The world’s remarkable lack of great composers may
have much to do with the sudden fame of Don Perosi,
the youthful Venetian priest—three of his oratorios are
already billed for the English festivals. If there is any-
thing in Perosi’s w-ork, he has the wav quite clear, for
Italy is left wil h poor old Verdi, the sole living relie of a
dead musical day, and mad Mascagni. The Frenchmen
have taken to writing operettas and other transient stage
frirolities ; and the musical glory of Germany seems to
have vanished absolutely since rugged old Wagner held
the fort.
When “ The Firm’s ” opera co. was going to Broken
Hill it remembered that that was the place where the
thermometer played about the 116 degree mark. So it
took out its gauziest gowns—and struck the town shiver-
ing in a temperature below freezing-point. And firewmod
had just been put up to 30s. a ton, too !
‘Perce”: Re Remenyi’s curio-craze. A West. Coast

the remark—“ Tank you ver’ mooch, mi fren. I tek dis

Mr. S. A. Palmer has opened a Sydney
branch for the distribution of his herbal remedy,
“ Vi'tadatio.”*
“ Floger,” on an important subject:—
Sydney is becoming swamped with women steno-
graphers and typewriters triad to accept employment at
any price ; some, doubtless, through stress of circum-
stances, but the great majority because they are in-
capahles. The reason is that thousands of parents have
an idea that their daughters have only to attend a short-
hand and typewriting school four hours a day for six
months (called a “complete course” by most schools),
and they will he competent to earn a living. To this end
the fee (mostly about ±l7) is, perhaps with difficulty,
scraped together, and the girl enters upon her “course”
with bright dreams of prospective independence. Result
(with a clever pupil), a 40-words-per-minute rate on the
typewriter and 100 ditto in shorthand. Sufficient, doubt-
less, for mere mechanical business purposes ; but far more
than this is needed in a position where a mistake may
cost a big sum, and where a knowledge of business-prac-
tice is indispensable. And what knowledge of the busi-
ness-world and its methods can be acquired during a
six months' course which leaves the girl as it found her,
grievously lacking not only in general information, but
in the commonest educational equipment? Girls iike
this simply keep on getting billets and being “ fired ” for
cotal incompetence, until they are forced into the ranks
of the “ any-pricers.” Competition prevents the adop-
tion by the schools of a thorough business-course of
education, because people will have the cheap and quick
course. Thus business-men are gradually coming to
abjure the petticoated so that, while the
number of employment-seeking girls is rapidly increasing,
the number of openings is steadily decreasing, and the
result cannot fail to he disastrous.

AUDITORS’ REPORT.
ttte have examined the annexed Balance Sheet made up to 30th June, 1899, and report that we find the several
VV jf, e ms therein stated to conform to the Balances in the General Ledger, and the Balance Sheets of the respective
Branches of i he Bank collectively.
We have counted the Cash and examined the Bills held by the Bank at the Head Office in Sydney on the 30th
June, 1899, and hereby certify that we have found them correct. We further certify that all Vouchers, Accounts, and
Documents necessary for verifying the Balance Sheet have been submitted to us. ■ - ,
The Cash, Bills and other Securities held at the Branch Banks in New South Wales and Queensland, on the date
of Balancing, have been certified to as being correct by the usual documents, and the figures of the Balance Sheet of
the London Branch have been received by cable.
In our opinion the Balance Sheet is a full and fair Balance Sheet, containing the particulars required by the
Articles of Association of the Australian Joint Stock Bank, Limited, and properly drawn up so as to exhibit a true and
correct view of the state of the Company’s affairs, as shown by the Books of the Company.
T. F. 11. MACKENZIE, F.S.I.A.
F. JAGO SMITH,
Auditors.
The Chairman, in moving the adoption of the report, said :
“ My duty is, on behalf of your Directors, to ask you to adopt the Report and Balance-sheet now in your hands, and
before formally doing so I have only a few words to say on that subject. Comparing: the Balance fig-tires with those
for last Half-year, there are increases in the following items—Bills in Circulation, Cash at London Bankers, and in
Bills Receivable and Loans to Customers, which are indications of an expansion of current business. Deposit money
decreased by a small amount, and the Coin has also decreased, but is accounted for by the increase of Bills Receiv-
able, the Current advance business, and payments in discharge of the B. Deposits in terms of Clause 10 of the
Arrangement of 1897. The next thing I ask your attention to, is the good position of the Bank with coin and liquid
assets, showing the absolute safety which we give to those customers who do business with us as depositors or
borrowers. The liability on Current Accounts and New Fixed Deposits, on the Notes issued and Bills payable and
the Interest accrued due to customers—in fact, every claim that can he brought against the New Bank is provided
for to the extent of 76 per cent, in Cash and liquid items as shown in the Balance-sheet, and there is besides further
cover in the shape of Bills Receivable, Bills Discounted, and Cash Credit Advances. This large provision for absolute
safeguarding of the Current business is not, I regret to say, productive of such a margin of profit as in previous
years, but we hope for better employment of our resources with the return of more ptosperous times. Thera are
many signs of a revival in business in view of the recent bountiful rains in some parts of this colony and the advanced
prices for our staple products.”

The Ways of Many Waters
Collects the dashing- ballads and verses of sailor-men’s
and wharf-men’s life which E. J. Brady has contributed
to The Budletin and the Sunday Times, Sydney. It is
the first attempt on the part of an Australian verse-
writer to chant the life on the sea and the margins of
the sea; though there is one horse-poem—the story of
“ How Jack Bowlin Steered ‘ Jones.’ ” The volume is
bound in buckram, with gilt top, in a size that will go
into a pocket without squeezing; and the price is ss.
post-free.
FLOWERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Blumen dir zu streuen.
Dies soil mich erfreuen.”
Lilies for thine innocence
With their whiteness vying,
Boses sweet with redolence
Of the summer dying ;
Sprays of rue for lovers’ grief,
And my song's one laurel leaf < • •
Purple of anemone
Starred in chaplets royal,
With a sprig of rosemary
For remembrance loyal ;
Pansies strewn in velvet plots
And the kind forget-me-nots . . .
Be the path with fragrance spread
Where thy feet are resting,
Farther back the leaves lie dead,
And Decay is nesting ;
Let my sighing rhyme be laid
Gently with the things decayed . . .
Ah, but in the Night’s great gloom
Where our dreams are mustered,
Lie old wreaths of pallid bloom
Still with cunning clustered ;
And the gods, in magic hours,
Deck with gold their withered flowers . . .
Traumes blumen dir zu streuen
Soil auf immer mich erfreuen.

Mr. C. J. A. NIELSEN.
A Living Witness of the virtues of the
Aifaline Herbal Remedies.
Kalgoorlie, September 12, 1898.
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir.—l feel it m3 r duty to write and tell you how
your remedies have cured me.
I suffered great agony with WEAK NERVES and
RHEUMATICS, and I sent for some of your ALFALINE
REMEDIES, which completely cured me, and I have felt
as well as I could wish, although it is two years ago.
I also tried your ALFALINE UNIVERSAL PILLS,
which completely cleared my skin and purified my blood,
and I am now using your ALFALINE HAIR RESTORER,
which has thoroughly cleaned the scalp and made the
hair grow again, and it has gradually turned the hair
from being grey to that of its original color. I have also
recommended your Remedies for a number of different
complaints and I have never known them to fail, but tc
do all that was claimed for them. I have great pleasure
to recommend these remedies to all sufferers, as I know
they can be depended on.
You are at liberty to publish this as well as niy photo.
Yours truly, C. J. A. NIELSEN-
Sciatica Cured.

To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir.—l can truthfully assert that since using your
Eucalyptus Oil and Aifaline Rheumatic Pills I have ex-
perienced an immunity from my attack of sciatic. I have
recommended the Aifaline Remedies to a number of my
constituents, and I will do the same to all whom I hear
complaining of rheumatic attacks. With kind regards,
I have the honor to be, yours truly,

To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir,—Having suffered for some time from a com
plaint of the liver and kidneys, for which I took medical
advice, with no effect, I one day was fortunate enough to
pick up one of your books in the bush. I was thus in-
duced to try your Aifaline Remedies, ana their effect was
magical. I have often since recommended them to my
neighbors, all of whom have felt the oenefit as well as
myself. I cannot express how glad lamat my recovery,
as several doctors had given me up, as my husband can
testify.—Yours truly, (Signed) Mrs. H. SMITH.

' 547 GEORGE ST
AND IMPORTANT BRANCHES AS FOLLOWS
syoiiEy,


Cootamundra’s abortive effort to raise a
fund for the entertainment of Gov. Beauchamp,
and the Governor’s announcement that for the
present he doesn’t intend to go there, are remin-
ders that in the early years N.S.W. Governors
paid all their own expenses when visiting inland
towns. And then the expenses were considerable,
as there were no Vice-regal trains. Up to Fitz-
roy’s time the Governors regarded it as a duty to
visit every large centre at least once in their term,
and to do this they hired the necessary horses,
provisioned their party, and paid their hotel bills
with spot cash.
Reid seems to have got out of tho N.S.W.
Treasurership just at the right time, and left his
successor, Carruthers, in a lovely hole. Reid got
out on 30th June, 1800. A few days later the
much-delayed Auditor-General's report for the
year ended 30th June, 1808, came to hand. It
was full of unpleasant remarks about Reid’s
financing during ’OB, and Carruthers, as Treasurer
now, has to stand the storm. Apparently Reid
saw the document coming, and stepped out of the
. way (into a better billet, too) at the psychological
moment;, and let the big report hit Carruthers in
the stomach.
Treasurer Braddon estimates Tasmania’s
present year’s surplus at .£OO,lBO. Customs duties
are to be reduced by £37,000, thus paving the way
for “ that more moderate tariff which must come
with Federation.” Which prompt levelling down
is a bad knock for the old 225. Gd. lie of the
N.S.W. anti-Federal gang, said lie being based on
the other lie that Tasmania could not do with less
customs revenue than it has already and therefore
that the N.S.W. tariff must be levelled up to meet
its case. There is to be a boom in public works,
no less than £227,740 being on the estimates.
This is a mighty lot for Tasmania, though not
nearly so much per head as N.S.W. is spending.
General-manager Stewart, of Chillagoe, is
probably at present in receipt of the biggest Aus-
tralian income from personal exertion. The big
Chillagoe co. is said to pay him £7500 a year, other
Chillagoe co.’s add £2500, and from the B.H.
Proprietary, whose general management he lately
resigned, he draws £lOOO a year as consulting ex-
pert. Stewart is, nevertheless, admittedly not in
the first flight of metallurgists, and there are no
doubt better miners; it was as an organiser
that he instantly impressed the B.H. Prop. men.
That is how intelligent private enterprise rewards
its servants. On the other hand, G. H. Reid has
for years been N.S.W. Premier at £1370 per
per annum—which, when he has paid all official
allowances; and subscriptions, probably means
£BOO or £ooo—less than is often received by a first-
class civil servant entitled to a pension.
The tragedy of poverty ! Five small
creatures were recently brought before the N.
Melb. police-court as neglected children. Ages
from 2 to 13 and scarcely sufficient clothing
amongst them for one. The eldest—a girl—
bugging her shivering baby brother to her breast,
told the tab*: —“ We were living in Arden-street,
N. Melb. Mother’s been in the madhouse for a
long time, and I’ve had to look after my brothers
and sisters. On Tuesday we were put out because
father, who is a piano-tuner, could not pay the
rent. Father got a van and put us and the bit of
furniture in it, and we were driven towards
Spencer-street. Father left the van and after a
bit came back with some food. Then he left us
again, arid we waited, and waited, and waited, but
be never came back and we’ve got no friends
and no relations.” The tragedy of it !
THIE
GRnmOPHODE
Some people think that the inventor claims too
much can be clone by the Gram-o-phone, but to
all those who doubt the statements I can only say
—Call in to my warehouse and let mo prove to
jron that its capabilities are all that I represent.
If you cannot call in person, send a friend, and
after the machine has been inspected, you will
Bend an order, and will never regret the day upon
which you invested your money in a
GRAMOPHONE.
Continuous supplies of New Records keep
arriving, and amongst the latest are reproductions
of VIOLIN performances.
The Patentees have devoted a great deal of
trouble and attention to the production of a
perfect VIOLIN record, and I am glad to
say that, after repeated disappointments, their
efforts have been crowned with success.
No sound re-producing machine has till now
been able to register a perfect Violin record, and
it is difficult to appreciate, without actual experi-
ence, the many technical and practical difficulties
that have been successfully overcome.
I have the pleasure to introduce to your notice
a series of VIOLIN records, executed by violinists
of repute, and I think it will be readily conceded
that for brilliancy of execution, and for delicacy
of tone, they have never been surpassed by any
records hitherto produced. The most delicate
cadenza, the most intricate bravoura passage, is
faith ully rendered. All the beauties of touch
and style, and the masterly technique of the
artist, will be readily appreciated by all music
lovers, and by violin players in particular.

OBJECTS OF THE COMPANY.
THIS COMPANY is being formed for the purpose of acquiring the right, title, and interest in three
gold leases issued by the Mines Department of Victoria, numbered respectively 33G9, 3370, and
3377, containing an area of about 120 acres, situated at Glasgow Range, nine miles from Ballarat, in
the Parish of Yarrowee, County of Grenville, and working same on the hydraulic dredging principle.
The property offered is right in the heart of one of the great gold fields of this Colony, and does
not require much said about it to recommend it to the public. The mere fact of it being in the Balla-
rat district, which has been so famous for its marvellous returns in gold, obtained from the innumer-
able mines that have been worked in that justly famed golden city, is sufficient in itself to warrant its
bond-tides.
The method proposed to be applied in working this property will be on the hydraulic dredging
principle, similar to that now in operation at Staghorn Flat, Yackandandah, owned by the Hon. J. A.
Wallace, M.L.C., the profits from which amounted to .£20,000 for 8 months of last year, as publicly
stated by that gentleman (vide Argus, September 17th, 1898).
The success attending hydraulic sluicing is obtained in the fact of the capacity for treating large
quantities of material at a nominal cost by this class of machinery, and its efficiency in saving gold,
which altogether removes the element of speculation or uncertainty.
Following is a comparative table of results which may be obtained from an estimated treatment of
57,000 tons per month, which is a very moderate computation, as Mr. Wallace has manipulated IGO
per hour, being equivalent to over 100,000 monthly allowing for all stoppages :
Table compiled to show the result from One Hydraulic Dredging Plant, treatin',r One Hundred
Loads oe Gravel and Tailings per Hour, and based on yields of 3,6, 9 and 12 Grains of Gold
to the Load :
the Australian Mining Standard, of the Bth June last, relative to dredging in New Zealand, in
which it which it is stated that 75 per cent, of the dredges pay dividends, and that some of tham pay
as much as 21 per cent, per week on capital invested.
The auriferous nature of the property it is proposed to work, and its adaptability for dredging,
will be apparent from the perusal of the attached reports from Messrs. Reginald A. F. Murray,
F.G.S., London, late Government Geologist of Victoria ; George A. Wilherforee, M.E., late engineer
to the Hon. J. A. Wallace ; «T. B. King, and Clias. Trevena, all of whom speak highly of the pro-
perty, and are unanimous that good results will be obtained.
The vendors show their confidence in the mine by taking the whole of their consideration in
shares, allowing all the cash realised by the sale of shares to go to the credit of the Company, to put it
into working order, thus demonstrating that they have no doubt of the mine being a highly payable
one.
The property presents advantageous features as a dredging proposition, and the promoters, in
placing it before the public, do so with every assurance as to its being a thorough, sound and legiti-
mate mining venture, and one that has every prospect of being placed on the dividend-paying list at
an early date.
A large number of shares have already been applied for, and as priority of date will be strictly
observed in allotting the shares, early application is necessary to prevent disappointment.
Prospectus and further information can be obtained from all recognised brokers, and from Messrs.
Fewcofski and Hill, GO to 70 Queen Street, Melbourne, who will also receive applications for shares.

Dear Sirs, —
The property indicated by you to me on the Parisli Plan of Yarrowee—portions of allotments
131° and 131 N. are shown on the geological map of the Ballarat goldfield, prepared from lr.y personal
survey, as containing in area of “ oldest gold drift,’’ resting on a silurian bedrock. I have a good recol-
lection of the place, and know that the gravel was worked for gold with success in the early days and
with crude appliances, but only to a limited extent.
There is a vast amount of gravel which, in all probability, contains gold generally diseminated
throughout its whole mass, and which, with adequate water supply, should pay well if dealt with on a
largo soale with proper appliances.—l am, Dear Sirs, Yours most respectfully,
(Signed) REGINALD A. F. MURRAY.
Messrs. Fewcofski and Hill, Melbourne. Ballarat East, June 14th, 1899.
Dear Sirs, —
I have pleasure in stating that in company with Mr. Trevena I visited your Leases, and
styled the “Jason,” bn 3rd inst. 1 found them to be composed of a fine quartz alluvial, and well
adapted for hydraulic sluicing. There are unmistakable signs of immense work having been done,
and no doubt large amounts of gold were taken out in the early days. There is abundant catchment
area for water, and many old races cut which could also be utilised to augment the supply. There
is also abundance of firewood, and taking these items into consideration, I have no hesitation in
stating that the material can be treated for 3d. per ton, which, according to the accounts of those
who are in a position to know the quality of the ground, should leave a very handsome margin for
X>rofit. —1 am, Dear Sirs, Yours faithfully, (Signed) GEO. A. WILBERFORCE M.E.

Messrs. Fewcofski and Hill, GO to 70 Queen-street, Melbourne. Melbourne, June 4th, 1899.
Dear Sirs, —
As requested, I furnish you with a report on your property called tho “Jason,” situated
about eleven miles south of Ballarat.
I visited your mine twice, and was very much pleased with the prospects of it, especially on my
second visit. There is, I should say, from 15 to 25 feet of gravel wash, containing gold from surface
to bottom, and is splendidly situated for hydraulic sluicing. I gave it a good trial with dish prospects
from top to bottom with very satisfactory results. Bulking all the prospects together, I should say it
would go at least £ a d wt. per load from the surface as deep down as I cquld get, and I feel siire that the
wash under foot that I could not get at would average more thaii double the prospects I have obtained.
What I tried has been driven out in the early days, and from what I could learn had been remarkably
rich ; in fact, it must have been to induce them to cut races and construct a puddling machine in those
days. There has been very little ground worked on your property; in fact, your property is virgin
ground so to speak. I traced the same run of wash on surface for over a quarter of a mile, and you
could go over as much bottom in a month with present appliances as has been worked altogether on
your property. It is the only ground I have seen similar to what we used to do so well out of in New
Zealand in the early days. Your ground has exceptional advantages for working, very little timber
to obstruct operations, no big stones, except, perhaps, on the bottom, and continues level-made ground
of the same character of wash as far as I could see all through your property, which will take a good
many years to work out.
In conclusion, I think I can with confidence recommend your property as likely (as far as I have
seen, with plenty of water and the way you intend working it) to be a dividend-paying mine for many
years to come.—Yours faithfully, (Signed) J. B. KING.
Messrs. Fewcofski and Hill, GO Queen Street, Melbourne. June 2nd, 1899.
Dear Sirs, —
As requested I furnish you with a report on your Mining property called the “Jason,” within
nine miles south-west of Ballarat.
It consists of about 120 acres of quartz-alluvial wash with a depth from 30 to 40 feet, very well
adapted for hydraulic sluicing. There has been a considerable amount of work done on it in the early
days, and, from what information I could get, with very good results; even with the primitive
appliances used at the time, I washed a considerable quantity of stuff by dish, which gave very
satisfactory returns. I should think it would yield from 1G to 18 grains to the ton, and, with the
quantity of wash and easy mode of working, it should give excellent returns.
You have very good catchments for water, as there are two partially-constructed dams, and also
some three miles of race, which could be made available with very little outlay. You have plenty of
timber for all purposes.
I think, gentlemen, with oareful and judioious management, you have a splendid property.
Yours faithfully, (Signed) CHAS. TREVENA.

The Case of
MISS EDITH A, BARKER.
(From the “Leichhardt Standard.”)
Another astonishing recovery having
come to our ears, a reporter was despatched
to the residence of Mrs. Barker, of Carlisle-
street, Leichhardt, Sydney, whose daughter,
jJliss Barker, had only lately regained her
health after a three years’ spell of suffering
from acute neuralgia. This young lady
showed no reluctance to be interviewed.
“ Pain,” said Miss Barker, in answer to
the newspaper man’s questions, “ pain isn’t
the word for it; why, the agony of it nearly
drove me mad. For three long and miser-
able years not a day passed but I was seized
with an acute attack of neuralgia. The
pain jumped round my face and head till I
was quite beside myself, and it would often
dart down into my shoulder as well. I
really hate to think, even now, how I
suffered, and I only wonder that I was able
to stand it as well as I did. I congratulate,
myself 100 times a day on my freedom from
that terrible neuralgia—then the bane of
my life. ”
“ Was your general health affected, Miss
Barker ?”
“ I should say so. I was deplorably thin,
and I got exceedingly weak. The excessive
strain on my nerves began to tell on my
whole nervous system. I always felt heavy
and weary. All my vital force disappeared,
and I got quite limp and helpless. I could
neither sleep nor eat. The miserable pam
in my head and jaws kept me awake all
night, and, as for eating, I was fairly
frightened to put any food in my mouth, for
this would frequently start; the neuralgia
again, just, perhaps, when I was recovering
from an attack of it. Besides, I had
no real appetite, and only at.) some-
thing when absolutely driven to do; so
by sheer weakness for lack of food.
I was run down frightfully, and was
but a mere shadow of what I once was.
I was a source of very great anxiety to my
mother, who used to give me all sorts of
medicine to try and get me cured. But
neither the doctor’s prescriptions nor the
preparations supplied me by the chemists
were able to cure me. Once or twice I
fancied I obtained some slight relief, but if
I did so it was of no service to me, for the
neuralgia came on with double force after-
wards. At last I was recommended to take
Clements Tonic. That is, a lady told my
mother it would cure me outright, and so
it did. I never came across such a remedy
in my life before. After three doses there
was a sort of slacking off in the awful pangs
in my face. I felt easier somehow, and
more able to bear the pain. After I had
taken a bottle I was ever so much better.
I improved all over. There was a good
colour in my cheeks. I had quite a healthy
craving for my meals once more, and was
ple.ased, you may be sure, when meal time
came. I began to get plumper and heavier
every day, and slept—well, I made up for
lost time, and no mistake. It was such a
relief to be able to sleep without being
roused half-a-dozen times in a night by
neuralgia. Now I just put mydiead on my
pillow, and slept right away till the morn-
ing. . I bought another bottle of Clements
Tonic, and that did all that was required.
My neuralgia has gone for ever—that is, I
have every reason to believe so, for it’s
never showed itself since. ”
Our reporter then put a few questions to
Mrs. Barker, the mother of the young lady.
“ I had a great deal of trouble with her,”
replied that lady. “ The months passed on
and on, and I couldn’t find anything to do
her good, till at length I adopted a recom-
mendation of a neighbour, and tried
Clements Tonic; and that remedy acted
just like magic. It pulled her round, and
made her bright and healthy again in no
time. It was quite a surprise to me to see
her so quickly cured, for I had had so many
failures with other medicines. lam sure it
will be a duty as well as a pleasure to my
daughter to make her case public.”
Our reporter then asked Miss Barkov's
permission to publish all that had pas~e
“Oh, yes, with pleasure.”

Acts with a Celerity that

The Case of
Mr. Joseph Meyers.
(From the “ Windsor Australian”)
(by our special reporter.)
What is still called Old Government House,
siiuate in George-street, Windsor, is now
the residence of
Rflr. Joseph Meyers, Painter and
Contractor.
It was here that a reporter from the Austra-
lian was fortunate enough to find that
gentleman.
“ I come to learn something of
Your Present Good Health,”
said the reporter.
“Concerning my illness, you mean,” re-
plied Mr. Meyers. “I shill be pleased to
tell you all about it.” Our reporter seated
himself opposite Mr. Meyers, who said—
“ My energy began to wane away. I used
to wonder what was the matter with me, for
my work, in which I once took a pleasure,
now became a burden to me.
I Was Always Tired,
and was just as weary at the commence-
ment of the day as at the finish. A queer
pain started in the upper poitioii of my
back. It felt like a sharp stab between the
shoulders. There was a
Bitterish, Sour Taste -r
in my mouth in the mornings, and I couldn't
tackle my breakfast, which was, up to then,
my best meal. Indeed, my appetite began
to fail altogether. I was very sleepy and
dull all day, arid hardly cared to move
unless I was absolutely compelled.”
“ How did you sleep at night time?”
“Badly—very ; I kept on waking up
In Fits and Starts
the night through, and the pain in my back
v»j very often severe enough to keep me
wide awake for most of the time,”
“ Did you guess what was the matter
with you ?”
“Oh, yes! I knew very well my liver
was out of order, and I frequently took
strong purgatives and other medicines to
make it work properly again, but nothing I
then took could check the progress of the
complaint, and since then I’ve come to the
conclusion that the regular taking of
cathartic medicine is a great mistake. Then
terrible
Headaches Afflicted Me.
I couldn’t eat a mouthful of food now with-
out suffering great discomfort afterwards,
such as wind and distension arid pain in the
chest, and every few days X should have a
bad bilious turn, when the very thought of
food would almost turn me up. ”
“ Did your liver troubles give rise to any
secondary symptoms?”
“Yes, most serious ones. My nervous
system got completely unstrung. The.’
merest trifles would give me a painful
shock. I lost my interest in things in
general, and began to get thin and pale. I
thought I was going to become a confirmed
invalid. I felt
Completely Worn Out,
and was just about to try a change of air
when my eye fell Upon a paragraph in a
newspaper telling the result of using
Ch merits Tonic in a severe case of liver
complaint. It was through reading this
that I was induced to obtain a couple of
bottles, and ! ,
I Was Fairly Astonished
at the celerity with which it stopped the
pain in my back. Clements Tonic braced
me up splendidly. I began to lift up my
head again instead of dragging about all
day in that heavy, drowsy way. 1 was able
to take some exercise now, and could eat
and sleep again properly.
No More Headaches
or nervousness troubled me, and I was at
the fourth bottle when I was quite well,
and getting as stout and strong as ever, and
considered it no longer necessary to take
Clements Tonic regularly, though I took a
dose now and then to clinch the cure, as it
were.”
“How is your health now?”
“ Perfect, and my liver must have;been
completely cured, for never since have I:felt*;
it.”
“ And you think Clements Tonic eradi-
cated the disease ?”
“I’m quite sure of that, for it was the
remedy I should have taken at'first if I had
known of it.”
“ With your consent this iriterview will
appear in the Australian.”
“ Certainly, I should like it to.”
Declared to be true,

How It Is.
In the streets of the town where I live I some-
times meet a poor fellow who is so badly off that
his appeal for a penny or two is hardly to be re-
sisted. He has lost both his legs above the knees
and punts himself along the pavement with his
hands, like a loaded barge in shallow water.
Thank Mercy, one doesn’t often see human hulks
like him. Where there is a single instance of a
man having lost both legs or both arms there are
a dozen where only one limb of the pair is missing.
And where there is a single case of the latter sort
there are a hundred cases of people who are lame,
or more or less disabled, by disease or minor in-
juries which are scarcely noticeable, yet in the
long run very serious to those so afflicted.
Consequently, when we sum up both classes, we
perceive that it isn’t the total wrecks and the in-
curables that are most expensive to society, but
the prodigious host which must work, and does
work, yet always under difficulties and against
hindrances. Men and women regularly em-
ployed, but who are continually breaking down in
a small way, thus losing fragments of time and
fractions of wages, are of the kind I mean. The
amount of income lost in this way in one year in
England is immense. And so far as the cause of
all this is disease, and not accident or born bodily
imperfection, it is almost always preventible and
generally curable. Look at this, for example, and
take heart.
“In the spring of this year (1897),” the writer
says, “my health began to fail me. My appetite
was poor, and after meals I had pain and weight
at the ehest. I could not sleep owing to the pain,
and I got weaker every day. I had so much pain
that I dared not eat, and rapidly lost flesh.
“ I was in agony night and day, and often sat
by the fire at night as-1 could not rest in bed. I
had a deal of muscular pain, particularly in the
arms. I gradually got worse and worse, and in
two months lost two score pounds weight.
“ I saw a doctor who gave me medicines and in-
jected morphia to ease the pain; but I was no
better for it. Then I met with a friend who told
me of the great benefit he had derived from the use
of a medicine called Mother Seigel’s Syrup. I gob
a bottle of it from Mr. S. Richkrdson, chemist,
Bridgman-street, and in a week I could eat well
and food no longer distressed me. Therefore, I
kept on with the medicine, and soon was strong
and well. I am now in the best of health, and
recommend this remedy to all I meet. You are at
liberty to publish this letter as you like. ” —(Signed)
William Bridge, Grocer and Baker, 65, Bridg-
man-street, Bolton, October sth, 1897.
Here we have an illustration of the proposition
with which this article sets out.', From Mr.
Bridge’s account of his own case we see that he
lost a considerable time from his business. How
much that represents in money he does not say ;
nor is it important to the argument. For two
months or more he lost from his business practi-
cally all he was worth to it; and what that situa-
tion would have signified, had it been indefinitely
continued, any intelligent person can imagine.
Men frequently become stricken with poverty as
with illness in that way. However well any
business may be managed in an emergency by
others, it is. not to be supposed that it gets on as
prosperously as when the proprietor is himself at
the helm. And he cannot be there while he is
suffering agonies from disease. This is true even
if we make no calculation of the direct expenses
created by illness, nor of the suffering experienced
the latter not computable in terms of money.
Now, please remark how quickly Mr. Bridge
was cured of his ailment—bad as it seemed and
really was. Dating from the time he began using
Mother Seigel’s Syrup, he says: —“ In a week I
could eat well, and the food no longer distressed
me.” His trouble was of the digestion only (acute
dyspepsia), for which this preparation long ago
proved itself a specific. Had he known of and
employed it when the attack began he would have
lost no time, felt no pain.
The lesson of the case is this: —As indigestion
is a common complaint, and dangerous also when
neglected, the remedy should be at hand for imme-
diate use when needed. The more valuable the
treasure the more strict should be the guard over
it. And health is a jewel compared with which
rubies are as the glass beads of savages.

FOXS’ PURR INDIGO.
As the result of many years of experience, FOXS’ PURE INDIGO DYE is recognised as the best in the Market. The superiority of Pure Indigo over other
dyes may be briefly summed up as follows :
FASTNESS OF THE DYE.—lndigotine, the colouring principle of Indigo, is insoluble in water, alcohol, ether, and dilute acids, and alkalies either hot or
cold, hence its extreme fastness for all conditions of ordinary wear and tear. It is also quite fast to Sunlight, and for an all-round dye there is nothing superior to
it- There is no need to point out the advantage there is in a perfectly fast dye, as compared with one which may be fast to light, but will not stand perspiration, or
washing, or vice versa.
STRENGTH AND HANDLE.—CIoth dyed Pure Indigo is stronger and tougher than the same cloth dyed in other ways, owing to the dye-bath being at
a comparatively low temperature, and the absence of any injurious chemicals or mordaunts. In almost all other dyes, the cloth is first boiled in the mordaunt and
then in the dye for some hours altogether. This always impoverishes the wool fibre, and destroys much of its natural lustre and softness, whereas the Indigo Vat
with its soft, mellow liquor, adds to the fulness and richness of the fabric. Indigo Dyeing being a mechanical process rather than a chemical one, actually feeds the cloth.
All their standard cloths are stamped every two yards on the back,
FOX PURE XCTXSXG-O,
• • and without this stamp are not Genuine*
These Celebrated Serges can be obtained from the leading Tailors and Drapers throughout the Australian Colonies.
See for yourselves that the Serge is stamped—FOX PURE INDIGO,-as many dealers for the sake of an
extra profit try to sell inferior-dyed cloths, remarking “that they are just as good as Pure Indigo.”

815 George Street (nearly opposite Railway Station), SYDNEY.
Grand Old Man Geo. Gladstone, father of Rev. Nathalia,
is a mine of anecdote, and one of his favorites is about
Charles Mathews. “When Charles appeared at Melb.
Royal in the morning to rehearse the ‘ Game of Specula-
tion,’ with his inimitable Affable Hawk, Daddy Rogers,
Jim Bartlett, Jimmy Milne, and the rest, paid Their
respects. Charley picked me out and said ‘ Dear me, I
think we have met before.’ ‘ Yes, sir,' said I, • I was the
original Frederick Noble with you in the “Game of Specu-
lation,” at London Lyceum, in 1851.’ ‘Well, well,’ says
Mathews, ‘ how the time flies ! And it is now 1871.’ You
fhall be Frederick Noble again.’ ‘ But, sir, lam too old.’
Old ! Damy ! You’re nothing like so old as I am.’ And
so I was once more Frederick Noble to the great
comedian.”
Fletcher McAdoo, brother to Orpheus, late of Sydney
Palace Theatre, had a joyful experience in Rarotonga,
where his company was playing. Part of the show con-
sisted of a friendly game of cards between McAdoo and
his trained dog, in which the dog usually won. Card-
playing is an abomination in missionary-ridden Raro-
tonga, and a native Judge, who daily risks death and
tempts Providence by calling himself Meringatamd,
promptly proceeded against showman and doc and im-
posed a line of lOdols.
Years ago, the clown and columbine of a panto, were
pals—were man and wife, in fact, by a theatrical arrange-
ment usually admitted by mummers to be just as good as
the clerical knot, especially when, as in this case the
clown’s own old original “Dutch” had left him for
reasons too numerous to mention. These two and several
others of the co. were invited to dinner one Sunday by
an_ ex-pro., who had “shaken” the “ profesh ’’and was
doing well in the vegetable line. The host had a bright
little girl of seven who had been to the show the night
before, and was in raptures about the dancing, sinking
and “ the lovely people dressed only in skin.” " Then the
clown said, “ Which part did you like best, dear?” “Oh
it was all lovely,” said the child ; “ but I think I liked
the clown and the concubine best.”
Handsome monuments cover the remains of Frank
Bates, “Johnny” Hall, Mrs. George Darrell, and others
which lie pretty close together in Melb. general cemetery’
but it would be hard to find the spot where lie the bones
of old “Billy” Hoskins. Years ago, attention was called
to the fact that the grave was unmarked, but
was done. By the way, the name on the gravestone of
Fanny Oathcart that was is Frances Darrell Price the
last being the real surname of our friend George Darrell.
“ For snobbery, side, and quiet damnation, the foreign
settlements in China,” says a Bulletin correspondent,
“ take the belt. At a Shanghai race-meeting I saw some
curious sights. Demi-monde here are mostty Americans
and very gorgeous. They are not allowed in the theatre
dress-circle, and on the course they are debarred from
entering the grand-stand part. Their carriages have to
avoid certain principal streets, but they thrive in spite of
it. The immorality of the elite would stagger even a
Westralian, and yet 20 people left the theatre last night
when Marcus Superbus made his attempt on Mercia in
the palace scene, in the ‘ Sign the Cross.’ Theatrical
business booms here, but is mostly in the hands of very
cronk companies.’’ J
’Murka has a famous woman agent for the placing of
stage plays, and all the choicest theatrical literary goods
are said to pass through her hands. Miss Marbury, the
expert in question, scored her first successful deal ’with
“ Little Lord Faunt.leroy.” She found the various mar-
kets for Mrs.’ Burnett’s comedy, and since then she has
come to be the recognised go-between for authors and
managers. The.big book in Miss Marbury’s registry-office
contains particulars of hundreds of desirable four-act
domestic dramas for sale, and the authors sit in rows in
the ante-room waiting to be engaged.
An anecdote of Paderewski credits the pampered
pianist with a horribly snobbish reply to a ’Murkan
woman who besought by letter “ a lock of his hair.” The
letter came to hand whilst Paddy and co. were on the
train-car, and his secretary wrote as follows: “ Dear
Madame,—M. Paderewski directs me to say that it affords
him much pleasure to comply with your" request. You
fail to specify whose hair you desire, and, to avoid error
he has secured a sample from each of the staff en voyage
—to wit, his manager, his secretary, his valet, his two
cooks, and his waiter, together with a small portion from
a mattress belonging to M. Pullman, propriataire of the
coach de luxe which we occupy.” Bloated piano-puncher !
By the way, Paderewski got married the other day.
THE USHER NEAR THE DOOR.
(With Banjo Accompaniment.)
When the show’s an awful duffer
And the sinking 1 makes you sad,
And your neighbors groan and suffer
Same as you, same as you ;
Do you ever sit and wonder
Whether someone’s going mad
Near the portal where the draught is blowing
through ?
Do you ever sit and wonder
If his brain has burst asunder
When you hear the beast demanding an “Ongcore”?
Never fear—he’s paid to do it,
Let me tell you (p’raps you knew it)
For that gusher is the usher near the door.
(Chorus.)
Ever laughing loud and clapping,
Or with stealthy stick a-rapping,
Rapping tumults of applause upon the floor,
He’s the author of a fiction,
He’s a damnable affliction,
Is that artful usher gusher near the door.
On the first night of a season
Sweat-drops sparkle on his brow—
Ah ! ’tis then you think his reason
Must have fled, must have fled,
For he’s oftentimes the only
Person kicking up a row—
Lord, forgive him! he is working for his bread.
In his corner dark and lonely
He’s the one applauder only
Of the girl you fain would gaze on nevermore ;
But he brings her, more’s the pity !
Back to croak another ditty,
Does that crafty, draughty usher near the door.
O, my weary, first-night brothers!
We have borne it long enough ;
For the sake of all the others,
Who have paid, who have paid,
Let us carefully consider,
How to stop the usher’s bluff
And submit him to our vengeance long-delayed
Yea, I beg you to consider
Ways and means to kill the “ kidder ’’ :
For myself, I’d love to dabble in his gore,
And I’d sing, when I was hanging
“ Well, at least, I stopp d the banging
Of that hireling demonstrator near the door.”
Ever laughing loud, and clapping,
Or with stealthy stick a-rapping,
Rapping tumults of applause upon the floor
He’s the author of a fiction,
He’s a damnable affliction
Is that artful usher gusher near the door.

On the Track.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Talk of cookies’ hurapies and farm-huts as miser-
able hovels—why, they’re perfect palaces compared
to places I’ve been in. I’ve dossed in such cabooses
out-back that old ’Tilda has nearly crawled away
from me. Bush-rhymesters of early days loved to
sing of “ Old Bark Huts,” and the joy of jogging
from one to t’other. 0 Lord !
Four bare walls and a leaky roof are often the
only home of a dozen men. No furniture, no
cleanliness, no anything. Often there are no
bunks. The naps are spread in the dust, and
everyone lies on his bed smoking, and spitting at
random. It’s this way : When there's a job to do,
a man is put on ; when it’s done, he’s sacked, so
none will trouble to rig a bunk that would mean
comfort for the next man.
On most stations there is a lonely little place,
away by itself, like a dead-house, called the
“Travellers’ Hut.” Squatters built them years
ago, when men wero scarce and not so given to
camping-out. It kept them away from sheds and
stables, too, and aloof from the regular hands.
The only difference between the two huts is that
each is worse than the other.
The men’s huts are generally thick to the roof
with tobacco-smoke, and at times half the hands
are drunk, and the abominable fumes of back-
block grog pervade the place; sometimes three
or four are sick, and then you have the smell of
drugs in addition.
The men are mostly illiterate bores. There’s
Bullocky Bill—blatherskiting for hours about what
Strawberry and Rattler can do ; and Sam, the
blacksmith, lecturing on the mending of cracked
saucepans; and the boundary.rider telling you
how long the water will last in this or that tank,
and if there was a sheep bogged in one he’ll be a
solid hour relating how he pulled it out.
“ Ever been to Sydney? ” I once asked by way
of a change.
“ Wal, no,” he said ; “but I was dashed close
ter Eurongella onct. Pulled up at Tally-Ho pub.
an’ got paralytic drunk in two nips.” That’s the
Waybacker’s ambition, to get “ paralytic drunk ”
occasionally, and make history of it in those
loathsome huts on Skeleton Creek and Dead Man’s
Hole.
A reasonably civilised and educated man can
only find disgust in such places. He can’t write
or enjoy a book for the continual swearing
and filthy yarn - telling going on around
him. There’s always some yahoo wanting to get
a pitch on, or to sing the “Old Bark Hut.”
Some want the door shut, some want it open ;
and then there’s always a row over the slush-
lamp. Some can’t sleep with the light burning,
others can’t smoke in the dark. Some one blows
it out; a chorus of voices calls him things un-
printable; and then someone lights itagain. . . .
Most travellers nowadays prefer to camp out.
Gfivon a tree, a bit of grass for “hipper,” a
blanket and a fire, and they’re at home.
The aborigine has taught Bushy a wrinkle in
fire-making. “White man big fool; make um
too big—can’t get close. By’n’bye burn down—
too cold. B'ackfeller make um little fire. All
night se-leep close up—budgeree warm ebery
time.”
By following this advice, however, I once burnt
my blankets.
Camping-out also has other drawbacks. Beetles
and crickets rustle the dead leaves, and have you
every ten minutes peering round with a fire-stick
to see if it’s a snake, or you spot a scorpion or a
centipede crawling over your pillow. I’ve had the
tucker-bag dragged from under my head by
’possums, and have been awakened by crows
pecking at my feet. But the greatest fright I
ever got was on Taabinga Creek, Q. I was dozing
under a tree, when two ’possums, which were
fighting overhead, dropped with a tremendous
thump on to my chest. It was then I uttered my
record yell.
Picked up half a tent once and rigged it like a
fly, blocking the end with two old shirts. Fixed
up a slush-lamp and settled down for a read, and
in five minutes my palace was ablaze. After that
I pegged along with gnnyahs of boughs, bark, old
bags, and sheet-iron. One wet night found me
with an old fellow under a lean-to. We were on
a slope, and towards midnight he complained of
water running in. “Ain’t you gettin’ wet?” he
asked, his teeth chattering. No; I was quite dry.
“Jumpin’ Jerusalem !’1 lie gasped, “the whole
blazin’ Murrumbidgee’s. agin me! ” He raised
himself, the water rushed through, and lin turn
was swamped. “You darned old cuss !” I said ;
“you couldn’t have got any wetter, so what was
the use o’ wettin’ me ! ” “ What yer givin’ us ! ”
he returned, “d’yer take me for a blanky dam ! ”
We sat the rest of the night leaning against one
another.
E.S.S.
The Psychology of a Punch on
the Nose.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The following was told to me by a long- faced
man who abominates fighting.
It happened last Boxing Day, at Olontarf
—a word a man used to my wife caused me
to shove him aside. There was a big crowd,
and we peeled. Dressed, my opponent ap-
peared an insignificant mannikin with little,
wet eyes; unrobed, he was a muscular fury,
with hands like knobs of quartz. He smelt,
ugh ! like a lion. I never saw such a fiend—he
crouched before me a bunch of horrible muscles.
The look in his eyes was sickening.
“ Go on ! ” yelled the crowd.
“Kill him, Harry ! ” whispered my wife. “ Kill
him, kill him ! ”
My hands went up mechanically as he ad-
vanced—sparring, dodging, feinting ; his lips
opened and shut; I saw the veins in his eyes
thicken, smelt the lion-like effluvium that exuded
from his pores. “Stop,” I whispered, “for
mercy’s sake ! ”
“ Yah ! ” His left fist smashed on the point of
my nose. I thought a star-shell had burst in
mid-air above me ; hot blood seemed to spring
from my eyes ; I felt that an army had trampled
on my face. Somebody propped me up. “Kill
him, Harry!” screamed my wife; “kill him,
kill him ! ”
My antagonist was now a mere gesticulating
impression before me—arms stabbing the air,
bubbling with human hatred. Again some invis-
ible power held up my hands, but I saw him
through an alembic of fear : it was his lion-smell
that murdered my courage. It seemed to me that
we had met aeons ago in a dark, wet jungle when
he was the stronger beast, and my physical cosmos
quaked with an instinctive knowledge of defeat.
“ Kill him, Harry ; kill him ! ”
He was stroking the air as a panther dabs at a
mouse; he grinned and talked a ferocious gib-
berish, and I thought that his teeth were alive ;
his ears seemed to flatten against his head. I
tried to speak to him, for I saw that he was pre-
paring to hit me in the same horrible place. I
wanted to tell him to strike .me on the breast,
throat or heart, anywhere save the point of the
nose. I felt that another such punch would jar
both eyes into my brain. And yet I wanted to
appear well before my wife ; I could never live-
down defeat with her.
My enemy drew towards me—a red imp from
Top’net, snarling, feinting, his face livid with
hate.
“ Don’t, don’t; for God’s sake, don’t! ” I whis-
pered. I saw the grin on his face, the sudden
animal curve of his throat as his arm swung back
murderously. “Whoo!” But I dropped howl-
ing at his feet, covering my nose with both hands.
_ “ Coward ! ” It was my wife who kicked my
ribs : the jeers of the crowd didn’t matter.

Dr. CLARKSON’S
REINVIGORATOR.
A Concentrated, VITALISING, NERVE, BRAIN,
MUSCLE, and BLOOD STIMULANT : a remedy
1< nown to Dr. Clarkson only. As a Tonic for the NERVES
it is unequalled. It is the most powerful of all BLOOD
STIMULANTS and Muscle Developers.
HEAD Til ESE FACTS.—Its action in recuperating
the exhausted substance of the brain-cells is simply elec-
trical. The REINVIGORATOR is as necessary in brain-
work as sleep is to our existence. The brain-cells of per-
sons who have died during periods of great exhaustion
from over-exertion are found to be considerably changed
from the condition of the normal cell during health and
visror.
WATER ON THE BRAIN.—The cell of the ex-
hausted brain, instead of being plum}) and full of nervous
matter, is vacuolated, a cavity within its substance having
formed and being filled with water. This means that a
part of the cell substance has been consumed during the
time of brain-activity.
DR. CLARKSON’S REINVIGORATOR, by its action
on the circulation ol the Blood, replenishes all this wasted
substance. You can no more hope to go on working:
successfully without thjs REINVIGORATOR than a loco-
motive can steam on indefinitely without fresh supplies
of fuel.
POPULAR FALLACY.—PeopIe run away with the
idea that exercise recuperates the brain. This is a mis-
take. While exercise may rest the mentally-overworked
part, it exhausts other portions of the brain and leads to
utter fatigue. No exercise can take the place of this
REINVIGORATOR.

The Garden of Love.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
All in a garden fair
Love dwelleth, far apart ;
Each rose that bloometh there
Is some true lover’s heart.
Over the mystic wall
That in the dawning gleams
Float odors magical
To fill the world with dreams.
One golden morning-tide
When birds began their song
“ Open the gate,” I cried,
For I have waited long.”
Then, pale as Eve’s white star,
Came Love, and low spake he—
“ Ere I the gate unbar,
Give thou thy heart to me ! ”
My heart from me was drawn
By this sweet wooing tale—
And he grew like the Dawn,
But I grew passion-pale.
Then earth and sky above
Bloomed glorious in mine eyes ;
And, hand in hand with Love,
I walked in Paradise.
VICTOR J. DALEY.
The disrespect with which parents treat
their children in this benighted land is harrowing
to the soul. A youth of 40 was recently running
round Brighton (Vic.) in search of police to arrest
his mother, and when a constable accompanied
the tender innocent home, he found the old lady
lying on the floor with a bashed head, adminis-
tered by her pet lamb of a son, who was
righteously indignant when the constable walked
him off, instead of his ferocious parent.
The adven: of the self-driving bike is
ithin measurable distance if Tripler’s Liquid Air
turns out a success. The trouble with the power
driven bike has been the furnace. Petroleum
simply stinks out every street the thing passes
through, and besides, the bike becomes an “auto-
car,’’..that is, a truck or cab, or carriage—anything
in the wide world but a bike. But with liquid
air a'man could carry in his tubes enough motive
power to drive him a hundred miles at top speed.
They begin to quarrel over the “ first
discovery” of gold in Westralia, just as they do
with regard to the event in N.S.W. and Yic.
Mr. R. Austin, a surveyor, now on the Hodgkin-
son (Q.), has lately been trying to get his claim
recognised. Austin was sent out in the early
fifties to explore the N.E. of the province, and he
described some of the geological features of the
Murchison and wrote that it would turn out to be
“ probably one of the finest goldfields in the
world.” But he stopped at that, and claimed
afterwards that his instructions did not cover a
search for minerals. The fact seems to be that
until the pastoral country had been secured “ the
families ” put a heavy, flat foot down on mining
prospects.
Bando’s Son.
A STORY FROM A VILLAGE SETTLEMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bando had his peculiarities, verging on eccen-
tricity. His utter inability to recognise a knock-
out seemed to argue a mild species of incipient
insanity. The Settlement had figuratively
jumped on him with both feet and pounded him
into chronic bankruptcy. For all that, he smiled
and faced Fate with a clean shave, a curled
moustache, and a somewhat faded Chesterfield.
Further, he spoke hopefully of the future, and
was full of schemes for the advancement of his
co-workers. There was some mental kink.
He had three sons. The eldest, a steady young
fellow, well-read on many subjects, a civil engineer
by profession, was a fine specimen of manhood—a
handsome, strong-haired, well-set man, with
womanish hands, and the cat-like quality of
muscle so often found in conjunction therewith.
Burnt to a brick, and hardened in the long, use-
less struggle through frosty winter and hell-
suggesting summer, he fought on silently, uncom-
plainingly, against Fate and his sand-patch. So
quietly that no one suspected the grim despera-
tion that prompted his tigerish effort, his search
after taproots deep as Hades, his delving for
water, the rattling pace of the bullock-handled
axe in spite of bleeding, blistered hands. None of
us knew that a girl, and one worth it, lay at the
bottom of it all till Herbert lay beyond the reach of
human help, a pitiful object for human sympathy.
He rode away, leading a horse. The horses
returned, and the insensible body of the man,
with a deep wound in the head, told what story
there was. He put-in a fortnight in the local
hospital, and was discharged cured.
Then he stripped his 15 acres—three bags to the
acre—and sold at Is. 6d. a bushel, to satisfy a
rapacious grocer. With what money he had left
he made a bee-line for Melbourne, and tramped
the streets for weeks in the hopeless quest of
work. Then he bought a horse and cart, and
started for the Settlement, to make another
attempt. The horse bolted, and smashed the
cart. He rode the horse 240 miles, and again
became an inmate of the hospital. A note to his
father, requesting his removal, was the first inti-
mation of trouble. The doctor reported signs of
progressive mental disorder. He came home in
charge of the old man, and was watched care-
fully.
His watchers agreed that he was “balmy.” When
he turned on them with a razor, and five of them
had spent themselves in rendering him powerless,
they agreed that he was a dangerous lunatic. But
Bando could not, or would not, believe that he
was past hope. “ Time would cure him,” he said.
Search through his private papers revealed
“ the girl,’’and the breaking-off of the engagement
some three months previously. Disregarding all
other possible causes, the oid man sent for the
girl, and, brick that she was, she came.
She was a fair, slight, straight-bodied little lady,
with sad eyes and a caress in her voice. I, one of
the watching shift for a certain Sunday, saw her
roam round the paddocks with that madman who
had assured me that Mrs. Yubagang possessed
the Secret of Life and that he’d cut her throat if
she did not yield it up to him. He had also said
that his race had been defiled by a Mongol, and
the injection of pure blood from a rooster would
be the only brake to still the dynamos that were
continually being applied to him. I watched
them, keeping behind, for he was jealous and no-
thing could save her if he turned crusty. She
was talking earnestly to him, striving to recall the
past to him, putting gentle womanly touches to
his collar and tie, and listening gravely, with
steady gray eyes fixed on him, to the peculiarly
keen, mystical madness that blended with the
coarsest of utterances as they fell from his lips.
Every man of us knew, and she knew too, that
the width of a hair only lay between life and
death in his company.
No use ! He grew worse. We subscribed for
his transfer to the Kew Asylum. The watch had
numbered five of late, and at times there was a dis-
tinctly homicidal tendency. The last night all
five of us were in his humpy; a dismal moaning in
the scrub outside, a steady patter of rain on the
roof. He lay on a bunk at one end. His father,
worn out with watching, slept restlessly in the
other bunk. Steel, Mason, and Sevika were
stretched out on the floor in front of the fire. I
sat on a kerosene-case and smoked. Drops of rain
sizzled in the ashes, and presently the fire died
out. I wanted wood, but at the first stir two wild
eyes glared from the bunk at me. In the gloom
of that hut the sensation was paralysing. I
wanted light, and prayed for a fat-lamp ; and still
it moaned and rained, and —I touched the old man.
He turned and groaned. The figure in the far
bunk sprang to a sitting posture and listened in-
tently. Then fell back, and tucking the clothes
viciously around itself, left nothing visible but a
white forehead and two burning eyes. I couldn’t
face it ; so I kicked Steel.
He’d be damned if he’d get up for any con-
founded cocky. “ Take the sack first thing in the
morning. ” The figure sprang out of bed. I col-
lared the poker and kicked Steel viciously. He
got up, and Mason, Sevika, and the old man also.
We watched the process of dressing, and,
strange, there was a faint gleam of insanity
about the lunatic as he carefully arranged tie and
collar and brushed his coat and pants. I asked
him, jocularly, was he going to see a girl. “ Yes,”
he answered, and we knew that our hands would
be full, till 8 o’clock at any rate. Three hours
and a half ahead ! —and what to do to amuse him
till then we didn’t know.
We coaxed and persuaded. He got away once,
but at a call from me came back like a disobedient
boy and expressed contrition.
There was an old fiddle hanging on the wall.
None of us could play except the old man. He
knew one tune, “John Brown’s Body,” and he
played it. His son joined us as we sang—sang
louder and more musically than any of us, laughed
heartily and took it up again. We stuck to it till
our throats were dry, our tongues parched—and
what a picture it made ! The old man in his
shabby gentility, sitting on the edge of the bunk,
with a half-smile on his worn old face, sawing out
“John Brown’s Body” over and over again on a
crotchety fiddle, while his mad son sang it with
the preoccupation of a child in his game. The
grey of the morning found us there, and never did
I see a more weirdly-pathetic sight.
At eight we escorted him to see “ the girl.” At
ten he was on the road to Kew, and there he is
now. Also, there you will be, if you fall in love
and attempt to make a home for your wife on a
Village Settlement.

One American iron-working concern turns
out annually nearly 2,000,000 tons of pig-iron,
besides about 1,000,000 tons of steel ingots and
650,000 tons of rails ; 8,176,000,0001 b. of metal in
a year!
A troublous question for Queensland (or
three-fourths of that province) in the future will
be the scarcity of building timber. The South
and the centre are becoming rapidly denuded of
pine and hardwood, and it is no unusual thing to
see American timber brought into Q. ports. On
the other hand, the Northern coast districts
(Cairns in particular) are wonderfully rich in
building material, and it is no uncommon thing
to see houses, h 'tels, and churches almost entirely
built of cedar—the cheapest timber obtainable
out Mareeba way.
S.A. Govt, keeps pegging away at its
artesian bores in the Far North. ITp from Her-
gott there are 16 of them completed or in progress
—some, as at Hergott, under 400 ft. deep. Others,

it ought, at an early date, to promote a geological
survey on a national scale for the purpose of more
accurately defining the artesian-water areas. So
far, Q., N.S.W., and S.A. have done much, but
have done it disjointedly. Thousands of pounds
have been wasted ; but where success has been
struck, such bright spots have been made in the
droughty country that many more of them will be
welcomed with great joy. And when that much
has happened—perhaps before—there will be need
to get a better use made of the flows than is
mostly the case nowadays.
As long as Chinese sailors and stewards are
allowed to land without proper check, so long will
Australia’s anti-alien Acts be evaded. A dozen
dungaree-clad heathen go ashore, make for Lilly-
buck or Lower George-street, and in some slum of
Melbourne or Sydney simply swop their garments
with other Chows desirous of leaving their bones
in their native land. The bogus nauticals go on
board, at night if possible, and pass count by the
customs officer. Sometimes they are well at sea
ere the dodge is disclosed. If they are discovered
sooner why should the shipping eo. do anything
except kick them privately? The liability of the
co. for Chows left behind is supposedly sufficient
guarantee, but if the co. can’t find its own China-
men, and some other Chinamen who will pass
muster just as well in the eye of the law are willing
to personate them, why should it inform on itself
and ask to be severely jumped upon ?

ments, satisfactory wear and solid value are assured.

** lam anxious to obtain all the prizes and honors possible. To do this I
know I must keep my blood and system in good order. For this purpose I
tried Ayer’s Sarsaparilla and the results have always been satisfactory.
“Training and racing make an excessive nervous strain and loss of nerve
force and physical strength. To quickly restore this loss of nerve energy and
power I have never found anything equal to Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. The Sarsa-
parilla keeps my blood pure and this tones up and strengthens my whole body.
“ Today I have the honor to be the champion cyclist of Forbes, thanks to
your wonderful medicine. I send you my portrait on my good steed that has
carried me with waving colors over the track.”
This is the testimony and portrait of the well-known cyclist, H. H. John-
son, of South Forbes, New South Wales.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla takes out all impurities from the blood. It changes
thin blood into rich, red blood, such blood as healthy nerves and muscles must
have. “Ayer’s ” and only Ayer’s is called
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”

All who are nervously depressed from a warm climate need it.
