of the tale so full of plums that the English pub-
lisher implored you to pick some out vaguely re-
minds us of historical auctioneer Robins’s eulogy
of a splendid estate —which had, however, two
faults. Eirst, you couldn’t keep the lawn clean —
the petals of the rose; made such a litter ; and,
second, it was quite impossible to get any sleep,
on account of the nightingales. But congratula-
tions ; and bv all means send copy.

Itecent Publications.
In Cassell’s Col. Library come F. R. Stockton’s
new book, “The Adventures of Captain Horn”
(35., 45.); and Conan Doyle’s “Doings of Raffles
Haw” (35., 45.). The first is an absurdly true-
looking tale of the finding of the Incas’ treasure.
Its “ artistic verisimilitude ” is wonderfully con-
vincing, yet the weight of detail somewhat dulls
the story. But the book is worth reading.
“ Raffles Haw ” is a fair sample of Doyle’s talent,
and has merit enough for the price of this cheaper
edition.
E. W. Cole issues “ Marked Personal ” (Is. 4d.),
by A. IC. Green. It is a sensational romance con-
structed a little bettor than most sensational
romances are, and may be classed as tolerable.
Macmillan and Co. send two recent Col. Library
vols. - C. M. Yonge’s “A Long Vacation,” and
Bram Stoker’s “Shoulder of Shasta” (each 35.,
45.). The first is a dull story of the “ young-
person ” or “family” type, strewn with appro-
priate morals ; the second is a fluent extension of
a short-story incident to two hundred and odd
pages. Macmillan’s Library is now well on its
way to 300 vols., and a good three-fourths of them
are the most absolutely uninteresting books that a
reviewer comes across. Who in “the colonies”
can read them ?
Rolf Boldrewoou's new story, “ The Crooked
Stick ” (Macmillan ; 35., 45.), is a good deal better
than his recent average. The plot is simple
enough—two men and a see-sawing maid —-but it is
expertly handled, thoroughly Australianised, and
made into a readable bush romance. No particular
inspiration, in short; but a quite satisfactory
amount of competent workmanship.
Periodicals.
The Xmas Numbers to hand this week outshine
all previous ones. The Sketch (Is. 4d.) is a
marvel at the price, with many fine illustrations
and a wealth of good literature. “ Beautiful
Women of the English Stage” form a special
supplement, and the photo, of a well-known Melb.
beauty has a place of honor.
In Town (Is. 4d.) gives even better value.
There is an album of “ British Beauties,” and six
coloured plates illustrating the visits of Santa
Claus to different countries. George Ashton con-
tributes the Australian figure—a typical miner
with a nugget. The tales are good; and the
number does the publishers great credit.
The English Illustrated Magazine for Nov.
(Is. ; 12s. per an.) is a particularly bright number
of a very bright magazine. An article on bull-
fighting is specially notable.
In “ Australian Boys and Girls ” (Is. lOd.)
Gordon and Gotch issue the first number
of what promises to be one of the very best
annuals. The contributors are Montgomery,
Becke, Favenc, Louise Mack, and Ethel
Turner, and their stories have high literary
value. The treatment is hardly adapted
for very Juvenile readers, but anyone from 12
upwards is bound to be interested. The added
biographical notes on the authors implicated are
very readable.
Single copies of the above publications post free
from Bulletin Book Exchange at prices quoted,
Gordon and Gotch are wholesale agents.
Pall Mall Magazine for Nov. (2s. 6d.) is dull,
and the literary contents are mostly commonplace.
One tale by S. Levett Yeats (author of “ The
Honor of Savelli ”) illustrates the difference
between English and Australian method. From
a Bulletin point of view the introduction and
interpolated gag should have been pruned ruth-
lessly. At half the length, the story would begin
to move.
George Robertson and Co. announce another
“ Australian Library,” the size of the handy
“ Pseudonym Is. 9d. posted. The first volume
will hold a new tale by Favenc, “The Moccasins
of Silence ’’—which is a taking title, anyway.
A third edition of “ Banjo’s ” verses is an-
nounced, making a total publication of 3250 copies
since Oct. 16—of which 2350 were sold in six
weeks.
RS" NOTE.—As most of the books men-
tioned are in strong demand, some may
be temporarily out of stock. In such
case, orders will be filed, and the books
forwarded immediately on arrival of next
shipment.
Any book or periodical will be for-
warded on receipt of price, particulars
of which will be given to enquirers. A
list of periodicals may be had on appli-
cation.

FOR THE BULLETIN.
Our truest aristocracy
Ye are, and each a “ title ” wear j
Ye glorify democracy,
But still retain your “ pages ” fair.
Ye speak with grave, decided air;
Ye give your word and stand by such ;
A world of cavillers ye dare :
O silent folk who say so much !
Ye show a blue face or a brown—
Are colored folk, as I declare’;
And every language of renown
Ye speak with equal ease and care;
Are migratory, too, and bear
To pass from English e’en to Dutch—
Though best ye bloom in native air;
O silent folk who say so much !
Our steadfast friends, a loyal band,
Who influence us unaware I
We feel your “clasp ” within our hand
And gladly wander everywhere;
Up pathless hills ye form a stair,
In realms of doubt ye lend your crutch,
And all ye know of heaven ye share :
O silent folk who say so much !
Envoi.
So strong for hope and for despair,
Ye leafy worlds where spirits touch !
What need that voices fret the air,
O silent folk who say so much ?

ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.

Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely ;—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &e.,

THE
Angelas Symphony
ri'HE Symphony is a keyboard instrument for general use, and
is also an automatic instrument reproducing mechanically
the notes of any music supplied. Thousands of pieces have been
prepared for the instrument and new selections continually
added, embracing the writings of the celebrated composers of
the past and composers of the presen! day, combining classical,
operatic, sacred, dance and popular music, all of which can be
performed upon the Symphony by a person having no know-
ledge whatever of music. While this is a wonderful advance-
ment over any mechanical instrument heretofore made, there is
in connection with the Symphony additional possibilities which
commend it to the educated musician.
The Symphony is fast becoming a factor in the conservatory
of music. The correct reading of a difficult passage in a vocal
or instrumental piece can be taught more readily to the pupil
from a demonstration upon the instrument than by any other
method of instruction. Practice has proved this.
Every Set of Reeds in the Symphony is operated by the Key
board; also every set is brought into use by the Automatic
attachment, whereby the full power of the instrument is
obtained if used either way.

NEW SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT RAILWAYS.
CHRISTMAS & NEW YEAR HOLIDAYS.
The Mountains. The Seaside. Ocean Breezes.
Ferny Dells. Forest Glades.
Fairy Scenes. Beautiful Lakes. Glorious Landscapes.
Boating, Bathing, Fishing, Picnics, etc.
The pleasures of an Australian holiday
have become largely enhanced through the
facilities afforded by the railways to the
dweller in the crowded, dusty city or wide-
spreading, arid plains of the interior to
escape to the cool, refreshing atmosphere of
the mountain ranges, in the one case, or the
delicious breezes of the seaside in the other,
where, forgetting the toil and worry of
business life, he obtains the change of scene
so necessary to the recuperation of his
physical and mental powers. To those
engaged in the routine of country labor there
can be no greater enjoyment than that
afforded by a holiday trip to one of the
beautiful seaside resorts in which New South
Wales is so rich ; and the opportunity fur-
nished by the summer holiday season for
enjoying this pleasure causes the approach of
Christmas and the New Year to be hailed
with delight by the sun-browned bushman,
who possesses a wide choice of picturesque
localities in which to pass his holiday hours.
To many, Sydney, with its beautiful sur-
roundings, will form an irresistible tempta-
tion, for, apart from its multitudinous attrac-
tions, it possesses much that is interesting
to the lovers of the picturesque ; its harbor
abounding with lovely spots, while within
easy reach of the heart of the city are broad
sea beaches and charming bays, washed by
the blue waters of the Pacific. North of the
ON THE HAWKESBURY
WEEPING ROCK, WENTWORTH FALLS, BLUE MOUNTAINS.
metropolis is the Hawkesbury, perhaps the most beautiful river in Australia, with its
extensive reaches, unsurpassed scenery, and ever-changing views of lofty hill and luxu-
riant valley. Beyond this stream is the extensive lake region of which Brisbane
Water, the Tuggerah Lakes, and Lake Macquarie are the principal features. Here the
lovers of boating and fishing may enjoy themselves to their hearts’ content, while in
the surrounding country there is an endless wealth of ferns and bush-flowers.
South of the metropolis, aim -st at its very threshold, is the magnificent National Park,
a charmingepitome of all that
is lovely and impressive in
Australian scenery; and a few
miles beyond the famous
Illawarra district, the Garden
of New South Wales, the
manifold beauties of which
have irresistibly impressed
those who have visited it.
Here, too, are the Bulli and
Macquarie Passes, Lake Illa-
warra, Clifton, Wollongong,
and other sea-side resorts ;
Kiama, with its great natural
phenomenon, the “Blow
Hole”; Now'ra, the metro-
polis of the luxuriant
Shoalhaven district; Kanga-
roo Valley; the Cambewarra
and other lofty mountain
ranges, and other delightfully
picturesque localities. Every
kind of sea-side enjoyment —
bathing, boating, sailing,
fishing, beach-rambles, etc.
—may be arranged at any of
the coastal townships or villages, where there is
plenty of good hotel accommodation at reason-
able rates. The Southern tourist district, be-
tween Mittagong and Goulburn, is, in many
places, a land of enchantment. Here are
the celebrated Fitzroy and Meryla Falls, the
scenic glories of Mittagong, Bandanoon and
other favorite halting jfiaces, with even
grander landscapes going beyond. From
Goulburn enjoyable trips may be made to
the Wombeyan Caves, or to Lake Bathurst
and Lake George, the latter being a notable
sportsmen’s resort.
Then there are the Blue Mountains, a
realm of shady glens, umbrageous recesses,
rippling streams, silvery cascades, and all
the myriad charms with which Nature
enchants the lovers of the beautiful.
Katoomba and Wentworth Falls, the
stupendous Valley of the Grose, and the
thousand and one natural marvels, have been
brought by the railway within the reach of
the holiday-maker. Then there are the
tlenolan Caves, the great subterranean won-
der-world, -which are easily reached from
Katoomba, Mount Victoria, or Tarana.
Everywhere the holiday-maker, whether
from town or country, finds much that is
lovely, refreshing and exhilarating in Nature
placed at his command, the tourist and ex-
cursion arrangements by trains being made
to suit the means and convenience of every
class of holiday-seeker*.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearue's Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“ We. theundersigned.have hadoccasion toobtain
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known ; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
—Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure. —J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir, —I had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it.—Yours faithfully, J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Elsternwick.”

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
WE beg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., ofN.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-cut No. 1,” “Cameo” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “Pure Gold ” and “Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W, D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
“ CASTLES” and “ CAPSTAN.”
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the nterest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Wills’ “Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

The Lancet says: “A cup of Fry’s Malted Cocoa contains more of the active
properties of malt than a pint of ale or stout.”
A combination of FRY’S Pure Cocoa Extract
-WITH-
Allen & Hanbury s’ Concentrated Extract of Malt.
The Lancet , December 18 th, 1880, p.
983. “This is an excellent preparation
of Cocoa and Malt Extract. It is diied
at a gentle heat to avoid injury to the
diastase ; its dietetic and digestive value
is beyond all dispute, and it is very agree-
able in flavor.”
British Medical Journal, November
13 th, 1880, p. 782.—“ Improvements in
Cocoa keep pace with advancing science,
and it is a matter of satisfaction that
attention has been turned to an article of
diet which has more to recommend it for
general use than any other known
beverage. The combination which has
been made in the preparation before us
of Allen & Hanbury’s Extract of Malt
with J. S. Fry & Sons’ Cocoa Extract
meets the requisite indications of diges-
tibility, nutritive quality, and palatable
character.”
Samuel Maughan, Esq., M.R.C.S.

Ist, 1881, p. 27.—“ We noticed awhile
ago an excellent combination of Fry’s
Chocolate with Allen & Hanbury’s Ex-
tract of Malt, and recommended it to the
profession. It has, as we expected, been
very favourably received, and Messrs.
Fry & Sons have now brought out a
Malted Cocoa, which is an admirable and
pleasant combination of their Pure Cocoa
Extract with Allen and Hanbury’s excel-
lent Malt Extract. The preparation is
convenient and handy for use—not
requiring any boiling—is highly nutri-
tive, refreshing, and very agreeable to
the palate.”
Dr. Nicholas C. Whyte, Coroner for
the City of Dublin, in his lecture given
on behalf of the Rathmines Sanitary
Association on April Ist, 1886, said :
“ Of special and concentrated foods, the
first and most useful preparation with
which I am acquainted is Fry’s Malted
Cocoa, a combination of Pure Extract of
Cocoa with Concentrated Extract of
Malt, invaluable as a food in exhaustive

A Visit to Scrubby Gully.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The men at the mine were anxious to have me
visit our magnificent property. The battery and
water-wheel were erected, there were 50 tons of
stone in the hopper, and we only needed water
and the blessing of Providence to start crushing
out big weekly dividends. I know now that there
has never been a time within the memory of man
when Scrubby Gully did not want water, and that
Scrubby Gully is the one place on earth to which
a discriminating man would betake himself if he
wished to avoid all the blessings of Providence for
ever, but that is beside the matter.
I was carefully instructed by letter to take the
train to Kanan, coach it to the Rabbit Trap, take
horse from Whalan’s to the Cross Roads, ask
someone at Old Poley’s on the hill to direct me to
Sheep’s Eye; from there strike West on foot,
keeping Bugle Point on my right, and “Chin
Whiskers ” would meet me at the Crossing.
There was no accommodation at the mine for city
visitors, but I was given to understand Mr. Larry
Jeans would be happy to accommodate me at his
homestead over the spur.
Casual references to Mr. Jeans in the corres-
pondence gave me the impression that Jeans was
an affluent gentleman of luxurious tastes and a
hospitable disposition, and that a harmless eccen-
tricity led him to follow agricultural and pastoral
pursuits in the vicinity of Scrubby Gully instead
of wasting his time in voluptuous ease in the city.
“ Chin Whiskers ” met me at The Crossing.
“ Chin Whiskers ” was a meditative giant who
exhausted his mental and physical energies chew-
ing tobacco, and who bore about his person in-
teresting and obvious evidence of the length and
the severity of the local drought—he was, in fact,
the drought incarnate. The Crossing was a mere
indication of a track across a yellow, rock-strewn
indentation between two hills, whicn indentation,
“ Chin Whiskers ” informed me, was “ The
Creek.” That did not surprise me, because I
knew that every second country township and dis-
trict in Australia has a somewhat similar indenta-
tion which it always calls “ The Creek.” Some-
times “ The Creek ” has moist places in it, some-
times it is quite damp for almost a dozen miles,
but more often it is as hard and dry as a brick-
kiln. When the indentation is really wet along its
whole length, it is invariably called “ The River.”
I found the mine; it was a simple, horizontal
hole bored in a hill. The battery was there, and
the waterwheel. The waterwheel stood disconso-
late beside che dust-strewn creek, and looked as
much at home as a waterwheel might be expected
to look in the centre of the sandy wastes of
Sahara. The working shareholders were un-
affectedly glad to see ine. They were sapless and
drought-stricken, but assured me, with great
enthusiasm, that they lived in momentary expec-
tation of a tremendous downfall. Leon had been
mending the roof of his hut, he said, in readiness
for the heavy rains which were due before morn-
ing. He examined the sky critically, and ex-
Eressed a belief that I would be detained on
crubby Gully a couple of weeks or so in conse-
quence of the floods.
This spirit of unreasonable hopefulness and
trust seemed to be shared by Cody, and Ellis, and
MacMahon, I alone was dubious. The journey
up had worn me out; the dry desolation all
around and the flagrant unprofitableness of our
spec, sickened me; but Jeans still remained —the
prodigal Jeans, with his spacious homestead and
profuse hospitality. I was heartfully grateful for
Jeans. We met in due course. As I talked with
Leen, a man came wearily down the hill, towing a
meagre horse, which, in turn, was towing a log.
This man delivered his log, unslung his animal,
and approached us, heroically lugging behind him
the miserable apology for a horse —a morbid brute
manifestly without a hope or ambition left
in life, and conveying mysteriously to the
observer a knowledge of its fixed and unshake-
able determination to lie down and die the
moment its owner’s attention was otherwise
directed. But the proprietor seemed fully
alive to the situation, and never allowed his
thoughts to stray entirely from the horse, but was
continually jerking its head up, and addressing
towards it reproaches, expostulations and curses—
curses that had lost all their vigor and dignity.
This man was Jeans, and if I had not seen his
horse I would have said that Jeans was the most
hopelessly heart - broken and utterly used -up
animal breathing on the face of the earth. He
was about 40, grey, hollow-cheeked, hollow-
chested, bent, and apathetic, with the dreadful
apathy that comes of wasted effort, vain toil, and
blasted hopes. J eans had a face that had forgot-
ten how to smile and never scowled ; a face that
took no exercise, but remained set in the one
wooden expression of joyless, passionless indiffer-
ence to whatever fate could offer henceforth and
forever. My last hopes exploded at the sight of
him.
Mr. Larry Jeans said I was welcome to camp
in the spare room, “up to” his place, and added
dully that “ proberly ” his missus could scrape up
grub enough for me “ fer a day’r two.” “Pro-
berly ” did not sound very encouraging, but I had
no option, and, being dead-beat, accepted the hos-
pitality offered, and followed Mr. Jeans. Larry
laboriously hauled his melancholy horse over a
couple of low stony rises, and then we tackled the
scrag end of the range, across which led a vague
track that wound in and out amongst a forest of
great rocks, and presented all the difficulties and
dangers of mountaineering without its compensa-
tions. Jeans struggled on with dull patience, and
in silence, < wing when it was necessary to divert
the old hor ■ from his morbid thoughts, and when
he briefly answered my questions. I gathered
from him that the men at the mine had been
expecting rain for four months.
“And what do you think of the chances?” I
asked.
“Oh, me, I never expect nothin’. Sometimes
things happen. I don’t expect ’em, though,”
“ Things happen—what, for instance?”
“Well, dry spells.”
I elicited that pleuro happened, and rabbits,
and fires, and “this here new-fangled fever.”
But whatever happened Jeans never fluctuated;
he had struck an average of misery, and was
bogged in the moral slough. It seemed as if his
sensibilities above a certain capacity had been
worn out by over-work and refused to feel more
than a fixed degree of trouble, so that whatever
might come on top of his present woes, be it fever,
or fire, or death, the man remained in his normal
condition of grim apathy and spiritless obedience
to fate.
The “homestead ’’stood upon the flat, timbered
country beyond the rise. It was just what Jeans’s
homestead might have been expected to be : a low
structure of bark and slabs, with a slab chimney
at one end, and a door in the middle between two
canvas “ windows.” It stood in a small clearing;
just beyond the house stood the skeleton of a shed
upon which, it being sundown, roosted a few
gaunt fowls; a lank cow with one horn was deeply
meditating by the front door. There were signs
of bold raids upon the stubborn bush, pathetic
ventures! and great butts lay about in evidence of
much weary, but unprofitable work. A dog-leg
fence, starting at no particular point, straddled
along in front of the house, and finished nowhere
about a hundred yards off. Not a new fence,
either, but an old one, with much dry grass matted
amongst the logs—that was the pathos of it.
There had been a brave attempt at a
garden, too ; but the few fruit-trees that
stood had been stripped of the bark,
and the hens had made dust- «
baths in all the beds. In this
dust an army of children were
wallowing half-clad, bare-
footed, dirt-encrusted children,
but all hale and boisterous.
At the door we were met by Mrs.
Larry Jeans, and after introducing
me as “him from the city,” the
master labored away, dragging his shuffling
horse, and leaving me in the centre of a wonder-
ing circle of youngsters of all sorts and sizes, from
two dusty mites not yet properly balanced on
their crooked little legs up to a shock-headed
lubberly boy of 13 curiously embossed with large
tan freckles, and a tall, gawky girl of the same
age in preposterously short skirts, whom my pre-
sence afflicted with a most painful bashfulness. A
peculiarity about Jeans’s children that struck me
was the fact that they seemed to run in sets: there
was a pair even for the sticky baby deftly hooked
under its mother’s left arm, judging by the petu-
lant wailing to be heard within.
The Jcans homestead consisted of two compart-
ments. I looked about in vain for the “ spare
room,” and concluded it must be either the
capacious fire-place or the skeleton shed on which
the hens were roosting. The principal article of
kitchen furniture was a long plank table built into
the floor; between it and the wall was a bush-
made form, also a fixture. A few crazy, three-
legged stools, a safe manufactured from a zinc-
lined case, and an odd assortment of crockery and
tin cups, saucers and plates, piled on slab shelves
in one corner, completed the list of “fixings.”
Mrs. Larry Jeans was a short, bony, homely
woman, very like her husband—strangely, pathe-
tically like in face and demeanour j similarly
bowed with labor, and with the same air of hope-
lessness and of accepting the toils and privations
of their miserable existence as an inevitable lot.
She was always working, and always had worked ;
her hands were hard and contorted in evidence of
it, and her cheek was as brown and as dry as
husks from laboring in the sun.
We had tea and bread and boiled onions and
corned beef for tea that evening—a minimum of
beef and a maximum of onions. The last onion-
crop had been a comparative success somewhere
within half a day’s journey of Scrubby Gully.
Tea served to introduce more children ; they
dangled over the arms of the unhappy mother,
hung to her skirts, sprawled about her feet,
squabbled in the corners, and over-ran the house.
Jeans helped to feed the brood in his slow, patient
way, and after tea he helped to pack away the
youngest in little bundles, here, there, and every-
where, where they slept peacefully, but in great
apparent peril, whilst the bigger kids charged
about the room and roared, and fought, and raised
a very pandemonium of their own. Every now
and again Mrs. Jeans would lift her tired head
from her sewing or her insatiable twins, and
say weakly, “Now, you Jinny, behave.” Or
Larry would remark dispassionately, “ Hi, you,
Billy !” But otherwise the youngsters raged un-
checked, their broken-spirited parents seeming to
regard the noise and worry of them as the lightest
trial in a world of struggling and trouble.
I asked Jeans how many children he thought
he had. He didn’t seem certain, but after due
deliberation said there might be thirteen in all.
He had probably lost count, for I am certain I
tallied fifteen —seven sets and one odd one.
When the washing-up was done, and half of the
family was bedded down, Larry dragged a tangle
of old harness from the other room, and sat for
two hours painfully piecing it up with cord, and
his wife sat opposite him, silent and blank of face,
mending one set of rags with another. I perched
upon a stool watching the pair, studying one face
after the other, irritated at length by the sheep-
like immobility of both, thinking it would be a
relief if Jeans would suddenly break out and do
something desperate, something to show that he
had not ? in spite of appearances, got beyond the
possibility of sanguinary revolt; but he worked on
steadily, uncomplainingly, till the boy with the
unique freckles came hurrying in with the intelli-
gence that the old horse was “havin’ a fit’r some-
thin’. Jeans did not swear. He said “Is he but?”
and put aside his harness, and went out, like a
man for whom life has no surprises.
The selector was over an hour struggling with
his hypochondriac horse, whilst I exchanged frag-
ments of conversation with Mrs. Jeans, and went
upon various mental excursions after that spare
room. It appeared that the Jeanses had neigh-
bors. There was another family settled seven
miles up the gully, but Mrs. Jeans informed me
that the Dicksons, being quiet and sort of down-
hearted, were not very good company, conse-
quently she and Jeans rarely visited them. I was
indulging in a mental prospect of the jubilation at
a reunion of the down-hearted Dicksons and the
gay and frivolous Jeanses when Larry returned
from his struggle with the horse. He resumed his
work upon the harness without any complaint.
His remark that “ them skewball horses is alwis
unreasonable ” was not spoken in a carping spirit;
it was given as conveying valuable information to
a stranger.
At 11 o’clock my host “s’posed that p’r’aps
maybe ” I was ready to turn in. I was, and we
went forth together in quest of the spare room.
The room in question proved to be a hastily-con-
structed lean-to on the far corner of the house at
the back. Inside one wall was six feet high, and
the other was merely a tree-butt. My bunk was
built against the butt, and between the bunk and
the roof there were about 18 inches of space. That
bunk had not been run up for a fat man. After
“FORCE OF HABIT."
establishing me in the spare room Jeans turned
to go.
“Best bar the door with a log, case o’ the cow,”
he said. “If she comes bumpin’ round in the
night, don’t mind. She walks in her sleep moon-
light nights. ”
It only needed this to convince me that I was
usurping the customary domicile of the meditative
cow. The room had been carefully furbished up,
and deeply carpeted with scrub ferns, but the cow
was not to be denied.
Weary as I was, I got little sleep that night. I
had fallen off comfortably about half-an-hour
after turning in, when I was awakened again by
some commotion in the house. Half-a-dozen of
the children were blubbering, and I could hear the
heavy tread of Larry ; and the equally heavy
tread of his wife, moving about the house. Pre-
sently both passed by the lean-to, and away in the
direction of the range. For another half-hour or
so there was silence, and then the one-horned cow
came along and tried my door. Failing to open it,
she tried the walls and the roof, but could not
break her way in, so she camped under the lee of
the structure, and lowed dismally at intervals till
daybreak.
When I arose a scantily-attired small boy
generously provided me with a pint pannikin
three-parts full of water. The water was for my
morning bath, and the small boy was careful to
warn me not to throw it away when I was through
with it. This youngster told me that “Had, an’
mum, an’ Jimmy ” had been out all night hunting
Steve. Steve, I gathered, was the one enter-
prising child in the household, and was in the
habit of going alone upon voyages of exploration
along the range, where, being a very little fellow,
he usually lost himself, and provided his parents
with a night’s entertainment searching for him in
the barren gorges and about the boulder-strewn
spurs of the range. How it happened that he was
not missed till nearly midnight on this occasion I
cannot say, unless the father and mother were
really as ignorant of the extent and character of
their family as they appeared to be.
Mrs. Jeans was the first to return, and she
brought Steve with her. The dear child had not
been lost, after all; incensed by some., indignity
that had been put upon him during the afternoon,
he had “ run away from home,” he said, and slept
all night in a lyombat’s hole about 200 yards
from the house. There his mother found him, re-
turning from her long, weary search. The inci-
dent did not appear to have affected her in any
way ; she looked as tired and as heartsick as on
the previous evening, but not more so.
“You know we lost one little one there” —she
extended her hand towards the low, rambling
repellent hills—“ an’ found him dead a week
after.”
Larry returned half-an-hour later, and his
apathy, under the circumstances, was simply
appalling.
We had fried onions and bread and tea for
breakfast, and immediately the meal was over
Larry, who I imagined would be going to bed for
a few hours, appeared in front of the house lead-
ing his deplorable horse. He was bound for the
mine, he said. I put in that day exploring the
tunnel, examining the immovable mill, hunting
for specimens in the quartz-tip, and listening to
Leen’s cheerful weather prophesies; and Jeans and
his soured quadruped dragged logs to the mine
from a patch of timber about a mile off, which
patch the men alluded to largely as The Gum
Forest.
Returning to the homestead at sundown we
found the children fighting in the dust, and the
one-horned cow meditating at the door, as on the
previous evening. I fancied I detected in the eye
of the cow a look of pathetic reproach as I passed
her. Tea that evening consisted mainly of roast
onions. Jeans felt called upon to apologise be-
cause the boys had been unable to trap ? '■abbit
for my benefit.
“ Now’n agen, after a rainy spell, we’re ’most
afraid the rabbits is a-goin’ to eat us, an’ then
when we’d like a rabbit-stoo there ain’t a rabbit
to be found within 20 mile,” said the settler im-
passively. “ When there is rabbits, there ain’t
onions,” he added as a further contribution to the
curiosities of natural history.
The second night at Scrubby Gully wa» pain-
fully like the first: Mrs. Jeans stitched, Mr.
Jeans labored over his tangle of harness, and the
brood rolled and tumbled about the room, raising
much dust and creating a deafening noise, to
which Larry and Mary, his wife, gave little heed.
When a section of the family had been parcelled
up and put to sleep, I was tempted to ask J eans
why he continued to live in that unhallowed, out-
of-the-way corner, and to waste his energies upon
a parched and blasted holding instead of settling
somewhere within reach of a market and beyond
the blight of tangible and visible despair that
hung over Scrubby Gully and its vicinity.
“Dunno,” said Jeans, without interest, “’pears
t’ me t’ be pretty much as bad otj*«r places. Evans
is the same, so’s Calder.”
I did not know either Evans 6r Calder, but I
pitied both from the bottom of my heart. Jeans
admitted that he had given up hope of getting the
timber off his land, though he “suspected” he
might be able to handle it somehow “ when the
boys grew up.” He further admitted that he
didn’t know “ as the land was good for anythin'
much ” when it was cleared; but his pessimism
was proof against all my arguments, and I went
sadly to bunk, leaving the man and his wife work-
ing with slow, animal perseverance, apparently
unconscious of the fact that they had not slept a
wink for over thirty hours.
The cow raided my room shortly after midnight.
She managed to break down the door this time,
but as her intentions were peaceful, and as it was
preferable rather to have her for a room-mate than
to be kept awake by her pathetic complaints, 1
made no attempt to evict her, and we both passed
an easy night.
I was up early next morning, but Mr. and Mrs.
J eans were before me. They were standing toge-
ther down by the aimless
dog-leg fence, and the hypo-
chondriacal horse lay be-
tween them. I walked
across, suspecting further
“ unreasonableness ” on the
part of the horse. The ani-
mal was dead.
“Old man, how’ll you
manage to haul those logs in
now?” As Mrs. Jeans said
this, I fancied I saw flicker in her
face for a moment a look of
spiritual agony, a hint of revolt that might
manifest itself in tears and bitter complain-
ings, but it passed in the instant.
Jeans merely shook his head, and answered
something indicative of the complete destruction
of his faith in “ them skewbald horses.”
We had bread and onions for breakfast.
When I last saw Jeans, as I was leaving Scrubby
that day, he was coming down the hill from the
direction of the gum forest, struggling in the blind-
ing heat, with a rope over his shoulder, towing a
nine-foot sluice log.
We had a letter from Jeans yesterday; he says
the working shareholders are hurrying to get the
sluice fixed over the wheel, and he (Jeans) antici-
pates a heavy downfall of rain during the night.

* *
Jim Bett and Jimmy Adams were working a
terrace claim on the Golden Coast of Maoriland.
They had come over as mates in the sixties.
They had faithfully followed every rush in those
years of rushes, suffered hardships, faced dangei s,
won gold, drunk gold.
Jim was a slight, sallow-faced man, black-eyed
and fiercely-whiskered. Jimmy was a giant of a
man; blue-eyed, flaxen-haired. Jim the Little
had the ruling voice. Jimmy the Big had its
echo. It had always been so since Jim nursed
Jimmy through a long bout of fever. They had
been mates for three years in Victoria, and since
they had been in Maoriland they had not been
parted for a single day. They had worked in wet
drives, on wild sea beaches, in the beds of rivers.
Winning gold, lacking gold, drinking gold, they
were always together. Jim took the lead where-
ever they went. Through jungle forests, over
mountains, along boulder beaches. Danger or
pleasure, Jim was always to the fore.
These two had made thousands and had spent
it almost as fast as they had made it. Now they
were old ; the days of rushes were over and
pounds were harder to win than hundreds at one
time. They had struck a lead six years before,
brought in a water-race, and had been sluicing in
a small way ever since. The lead had given them
six or seven ounces of gold a week ; now it only
yielded half that per month, and, as Jim had
remarked, it was nearly played out.
The stream on which they worked—the Swallow
—ran into the Pa-iti, and the Pa-iti ran into the
Kahu, which ran into the sea.
At the junction of the Swallow with the Pa-iti
there was an accommodation-house —a grog-shop
and store combined. At the mouth of the Kahu
was a township which neither Jim nor Jimmy
had seen. They walked regularly every Saturday
night to the accommodation-house, got drunk soon
after their arrival, remained drunk all Sunday
and walked home on Monday with their week’s
tucker on their backs and vows of amendment on
their lips. In this weekly journey they had beaten
a fairly deep track through the forest and round
the bluff. They were the only persons who used
the track, and the wonder is that on their Mon-
day’s journey they had not gone off it over the
precipitous bluff into the dark, deep, swirling
river six hundred feet below.
Above their log-hut rose great wooded hills
wrapped in dense forests, and beyond these more
hills. The forests sloped down to the timber-strewn
ocean beach. Westward there was range after
range rising higher and higher to the great central
mountains. A wild, grand, gloomy country, deso-
late save where in the seaward gorges man worked
for gold.
* # *
The rock was reached at last —the lead was
played out. J immy looked at Jim and Jim looked
at Jimmy, and for the first time in their life
together Jim was not to the fore. He seemed to
swallow something before he spoke ; then he said :
“ Jimmy, where are we to go 2 ” and Jimmy
echoed mournfully : “ Where are we to go 2” ‘ We
are old men,” continued Jim, “ and nearly played
out.”
“ Nearly played out.”
“ We’ve talked often of making a rise, we have
—making a rise and going home to the old
country.”
“ The old country,” added Jimmy very softly.
“Settling down,” went on Jim, “in my old
village, living in a snug cottage, having my old
chums to see us and listen to our yarns, and see-
ing the old sweethearts I used to have.”
“ Mary Burton,” murmured Jimmy.
“ Mary Burton and Annie Lister,”
“ And Susan Carter, Jim.”
There was a long silence, and both men sent out
yards of smoke : they were lying pipe in mouth on
their rude bunks.
“ Jimmy.”
“Yes, Jim.”
“There’s the Hopeful. You remember what
Curly told us how they got seven thousand notes
worth in six weeks. Nobody else knows about the
place but us, and I reckon we can go where Curly
went.”
“ Mary Burton —old country,” quavered Jimmy,
forgetting to echo for once.
A longer silence, more yards of smoke, then
Jim went on:
“ You could go down to-morrow with the gold
and bring up as much tucker as you could carry.”
“ Fifty pounds of flour, twenty of oatmeal, ten
split peas, some tea.”
“ Just that, Jimmy, the old prospecting go.
“ And you won’t come down, Jim! ”
“No, lad, no. Re-
member, we’ve only
this pinch of gold and
—well, I’d better not.
Missis Cogging would
expect us to have a
few drinks —I better
not go. We know the
spot right enough.
Up the Swallow, then
way up the range
above the bush-line.
It is rough walking
on the crest of the
range, but it’s open
country—better than
pushing through the
bush. We couldn’t
make three miles a
day if we kept to the
bush. We can keep
on the high country
until we see a black
gully without any
trees running due
east, and at the mouth
of it a sugarloaf
mountain covered al-
ways with snow. We
have to make down
the gully and then
strike south between
the ranges until we cross two rivers; the third
river is the Hopeful. ”
“Deep gorge, rocky bottom, heavy gold,” said
J immy.
“ If we can make a rise, the old country, lad,
and a quiet life, a comfortable home, and some-
body to cook for us ! ”
“ Mary Burton and Annie Lister, and ”
“ If we don’t make a rise—well, we shall be like
the load ”
“ Played out,” sighed Jimmy.
“ Played out, lad, and whether we get buried in
the snow on the ranges or whether we get drowned
crossing the rivers it won’t matter, for we shan’t
have a chance for the old country, and life isn’t
much good here. Jimmy, we might ha’ gone
home many a time. We’ve had the money and
we’ve squandered it in those damned bush
shanties. But we’ve had our sprees, lad —royal
sprees, too, sometimes, and we aren’t played out
altogether yet.”
“Not played out yet,” replied Jimmy, quite
briskly.
“If we can strike it rich in the Hopeful—make
even a thousand between us, it would keep us
snug for the rest of our lives.”
“ I’ll fetch up the tucker,” said Jimmy.
“ And we will start on Sunday.”
Jimmy gasped at this promptness. Six years
of Sundays at the grog-shanty had made him
balieve Sunday was sacred to Bacchus. But he
said boldly, “ I’ll start early on Saturday moiming
and get back before dark. ”
* * *
Sunday morning in a Westland gorge. Sunday
morning, bright, serene, balmy; and two weather-
beaten, grizzled old men tramping over crimson-
mossed stones in the shadow of hanging fo.ests
and towering untrodden hills.
They pushed their way across the shingle,
entered the silent forest and scrambled over dead
logs beautified with rare ferns and delicate mosses;
crashing through scrub and climbing steadily up-
wards. By nightfall they reached a huge rook on
the crest of the range and camped in its shelter
amidst dwarf specimens of the stately trees on the
lower slopes. They cut down brushwood for a
breakwind and ate their simple meal by a small
wood fire, then turned into their blankets on the
ground and slept in that wild, desolate place where
white had never slept before. They marched for-
ward all next day, Jim taking the lead. On for
another day in the cold crisp air of high altitudes,
fo cing their way through stunted jungles, skirt-
ing huge bare rocks, crossing stretches of ground
swept clean by storms and winter snows. Day
after day steadily, persistently, each knowing that
they were on their last and wildest venture. At
the end of seven days Jim, the ruling spirit, pro-
posed to camp for a spell, and Jimmy stared at
him in surprise. It was the first time his partner
had ever acknowledged that he required a rest.
They camped for a day and then set forward
again, keeping always on the crest of the range,
the roughest of ways, but still clear of that dense
jungle which makes the low country of Westland
so impassable. They saw many gullies all clad
with forests, but at last they saw below them on
their left a dark reft in the hills, bare-sided, edged
with crumbling precipices, and far away at its
mouth rose a gigantic snow-clad mountain. That
huge reft was the gully they sought. They
skirted its northern brink, looking for some means
of descent, and whilst they scrambled over the
rocky slopes a white mist swept round the distant
mountain and marched up the huge chasm, swell-
ing like a tide, until it surrounded them with i -y
dampness and shut off from them all sight of dis-
tant objects.
“ We must camp again, Jimmy, it’s no use
travelling in this fog, and I fear we shall have bad
weather. ”
“Bad weather,” echoed Jimmy.
They spread their blankets and tent on a rocky
slope birren of any stone smaller than a cart, so
storm-swept, so snow-worn was it. There was
not a stick nor a twig for miles around them —
nothing to help them pitch a tent or make a lire.
The mist hung over them like a pall; darkness
impenetrable descended with the night. They
ate a little raw oatmeal, and then, wii.h only tain
blankets between them and the cold mist, they
tried to sleep. The rock on which they lay was
like glacier ice.
“I’m chilly,” said Jim rather querulously.
“ Chilly, groaned his echo.
They slept by fits, dozing even in that miserable
plight as men will doze when lying hungry and
cold in the night air, awakening every few
minutes to cramping pain and inexpressible dis-
comfort.
They arose next morning tired and stiff. The
mist still enveloped them, shut off from them
sight of everything save the ground at their feet.
To the right of them was the crumbling edge of
the mighty precipice, to the left a gaunt, unclimb-
able ridge.
They pushed on through the day slowly,
cautiously. At night they camped once more on
the cold rocks, dozing and awaking until the
clammy mist seemed to enter their veins.
Jim spoke few words, and Jimmy barely echoed
them. They were not men to bemoan their posi-
tion, for they were of the old prospecting blood,
trained by hardships.
Another day of cautious tramping through the
mist, another night on the ground, their food still
coarse oatmeal mixed with icy water; or, as a
change, raw flour-gruel.
On the fourth day they reached a slope of
crumbling rock so steep that when one loose stone
was dislodged it rolled down, and gathered others
into an avalanche that slid with a crashing sound
until it leaped over the edge, into the awful abyss
below.
Travelling was desperate work in that wild
place. The men slipped and stumbled at every
step. Their burden of blankets and provisions,
carried bush - fashion, high on their shoulders,
brought them down heavily when they fell and
made rising a difficult matter.
They struggled on, seeking some space of clear
ground, but the further they went the rougher
was the country. At last Jim, springing on to the
edge of a rock,
missed his
footing and
fell face-down-
wards on a
jagged stone.
He tried to
scramble to
his feet again
but failed, and

“We must

Jim with he-
roic calmness.
He would not
let even his
mate of 20
years see signs
of weakness.
They built a
rough barri-
cade of loose

blankets and
tents around
them, and, ut-

Whilst they
rested the
dead silence
of the sur-
rounding mists
was broken,
a strange
moaning
sound came up
from the un-
known depths.
Jim heard
this sound,
he knew that
it meant wind,
and he thrust away a picture of storm and
snow. “ The fog is clearing, Jimmy,” he said under
the blankets; “we shall make the Hopeful yet.
Only a few hundred pounds’ worth, Jimmy, and
then the old country and rest.”
“ And rest,” echoed Jimmy.
A strange warmth stole over the two men and
with it a drowsiness that was most pleasant. It
was the influence of an atmospheric change pro-
ceeding a storm.
“If we can get on to low ground again and
cross the rivers and —and what was I saying,

Jimmy gave a sleepy groan.
The moaning sounds grew louder, but the men
were deaf with sleep. A few drops of rain fell
and a gust of wind swept over them, but, worn
by exposure, they slept heavily.
Another gust swept over them ; then out of the
blackness came snow—dancing, whirling, silent.
The great flakes dropped like feathers on the
covering and deadened the sound of the rising
wind. Jim murmured in his sleep of old country
and Mary Burton, but Jimmy was silent. The
“ They rolled blankets and tents around them... and found a little warmth."
roar of the storm took possession of the night, yet
the two men beneath their covering of tent and
blankets slumbered serenely ; then the air which
had come to them through the crevices in the
xocks was shut off by the gathering snow. Jim,
struggling in some mad dream, shouted :
“ Played out!”
And then a strange thing happened—rocks,
men, snow, began to slide down the slope—
down faster and faster until, with avalanche
speed, they shot over the edge of that great
precipice and went whirling through darkness
down into a river-pool whose icy depths could hold
for ever the secret of two lives

FORM THE CULF
Store cattle from Nelanjie! The mob goes
feeding past,
With half-a-mileof sandhill ’twixt the leaders and
the last;
The nags that move behind them are the good old
Queensland stamp—
Short backs and perfect shoulders that are price-
less on a camp;
And these are men that ride them, broad-chested,
tanned and tall,
The bravest hearts amongst us an 1 the lightest
hands of all.
Oh ! let them wade in Wonga grass and taste the
Wonga dew,
And let them spread, those thousand head—for
we’ve been droving too !
Store cattle from Nelanjie! By half-a-hundred
towns,
By Northern ranges rough and red, by rolling
open downs,
By stock-routes brown and burnt and bare, by
flood-wrapped river- bends,
They’ve hunted them from gate to gate—the
drover has no friends ;
But idly they may ride to-day beneath the scorch-
ing sun
And let the hungry bullocks try the grass on
Wonga run;
No overseer dogs them here to “ see the cattle
through,”
But they may spread their thousand head —for
we’ve been droving too !
Store cattle from Nelanjie! They’ve a naked
track to steer,
The stockyards at Wodonga are a long way down
from here;
The creeks won’t run till God knows when, and
half the holes are dry,
The tanks are few and far between and water’s
dear to buy ;
There’s plenty at the Brolga Bore for all his stock
and mine—
We’ll pass him with a brave God-speed across the
Border Line,
And if he goes a five-mile stage and loiters slowly
through.
We’ll only think the more of him —for we’ve been
droving too !
Store cattle from Nelanjie! They’re mute as
milkers now,
But yonder grizzled drover, with the care-lines on
his brow,
Could tell of merry musters on the big Nelanjie
plains,
With blood upon the chestnut’s flanks and foam
upon the reins ;
Could tell of nights upon the road when those
same mild-eyed steers
Went ringing round the river bend and through
the scrub like spears ;
And if his words are rude and rough, we know his
words are true,
We know what wild Nelanjies are —and we’ve
been droving too !
Store cattle from Nelanjie! Around the lire at
night
They’ve watched the pine-tree shadows lift before
the dancing light;
They’ve lain awake to listen when the weird bush-
voices apeak,
And heard the lilting bells go by along the empty
creek;
They’ve spun the yarns of hut and camp, the tales
of play and work,
The wond’rous tales that gild the road from Nor-
manton to Bourke ;
They’ve told of fortune foul and fair, of women
false and true,
And well we know the songs they’ve sung—for
we’ve been droving too !
Store cattle from Nelanjie ! Their breath is on
the breeze ;
You hear them tread, a thousand head, in blue-
grass to the knees ;
The lead is on the netting-fence, the wings are
spreading wide,
The lame and laggard scarcely move—so slow the
drovers ride.
But let them stay and feed to-day for sake of
Auld Lang Syne;
They’ll never get a chance like this below the
Border Line;
And if they tread our frontage down, what’s that
to me or you ?
What’s ours to fare, by God they’ll share! for
we’ve been droving too !

FOUR SONGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LITTLE GOLDEN HAIR.
Scatter ah tug her way
No bursting flowers, no roses,
No lilies with heart of day,
Primrose that the night uncloses ;
Not any flowers at all,
For she loved them. Not as a pall
Would she have them pressing upon her breast.
Carry her flowerless to her rest.
Deaden the violins.
Have not her feet been dancing
To strains from their strings ? . . . She wins
Overall when her feet go glancing. . . .
Never a wind or wave
Danced like that little child. Her grave
Must be hushed from strains, lest her small, still
feet,
Ache in the earth for the rhythmic beat.
Spirit of life and light,
Restless, born blind to sorrow,
Often when others slept, by night,
She made her sweet, small plans for morrow.
Now if she wake . . . But no !
Slumber like that lasts on. Ah, slow
With the little pall ! Let them turn her eyes
E ast, where the suns that she rose with rise.
Only one sign of woe—
For we believe her living,
Hear her, as days ago,
With her laugh, and her small kissgiving—
Only to draw the blind,
And shut the pitiless sun behind ;
Lest the sunbeams, gleaming about the stair,
Deaden one memory of her golden hair.
OF A WILD WHITE BIRD.
To soar as a wild white bird,
With a song unbound and fetterless :
With a gush of song in the throat,
Loosened and loud and letterless.
And the wind its only accompaniment.
To sing and soar and look down
On a world one leaves when one tires of it;
With a glancing wing for a sail,
Dashing, when one desires of it,
Through tbe spray of the great sea-wilderness ;
Or sweeping with mighty curves
From land to sky, and to land again :•
To oast off Time, and to stay
Where one’s will alone lays hand on one ;
Not to own nor owe in the universe.
Sudden and swift some day
Meet Death, and know no fear of Him,
But close the eyes and have done.
. . . When a wild bird dies none hear of him.
He has sung and ceased, and is happiest.
OF THIS CITY.
O, to mix in my soul this city,
That lies with feet in the fairest waters,
This young, unformed Australian city !
In the harbor’s arms the isles, her daughters,
Dream all day in a perfect sleep.
O, to hold in my heart those waters,
Flowing east with the sun behind them,
Through great gates to the outer deep !
Where, O Earth ! is a fairer city
Than this by night? when the quay’s half-circle,
Lit up like some old Italian city
With a hundred shades of red and purple,
Lights the dusk of the city’s face.
Half the night to the gleaming circle
Boats glide in with their own lights shining—
Not the stars know a fairer place.
Ah, the mist on the moonlit city—
The sky-spun moonlight, half-light, half-dark-
ness,
That wraps the walls of the seaward city,
And swathes and softens the high spires’ sharp-
ness.
Ah, the sweet of the wave-washed town !
Subtle city of wrong, and darkness,
Young, but tireless in evil-doing—
One soul aches for your high renown.
O, to sing of this little city
A true, strong song that no years can weaken,
A song that tells how the sea-girt city
Cast her light o’er the seas, a beacon
Seen and sought by the far-most sail ;
Made a name that no years could weaken ;
Fought a way to the fore of nations,
All lands owning her vast avail.
ON WAIREE HILL.
Do you remember meeting, meeting
Here when the wattle’s boughs grew golden,
•(Ah, golden wattle, how sweet, how sweet)!
And under the drip of its gold burrs beating
Light on our heads with the wind just risen,
VV6 cast our hearts into one strait prison,
And neither asked for the key to keep.
(Ah, golden wattles, how sad, how sweet !)
Have you forgotten watching, watching
There, where the white dust clouds the cross-ways ;
(O, silent cross-ways, how still, how still !)
My blade in the bark of a great gum notching
Names that the years have made black and
narrow—
Your name and mine, and a heart and arrow;
And you were angry, you said, and smiled.
(O, silent cross-ways, how sad, how still !)
I >o you remember riding, riding
West, with the stretch of the plains before us ?
(O, plains of Wairee, so great, so grey !)
The sky in the west was gilding, gliding,
■'bedding its red in a million places ;
Dio fleet wind gurgled against our faces—
Our rush was swifter than wing or wind.
(O, plains of Wairee, so grey, so still 1)
Tis I remember creeping, creeping
') ver the hill with a slow procession,
(Your slowest wending of Wairee Hill).
I <-an hear through the years ytnlr mother’s weeping,
'••c through the years the paddocks lying
I n noon’s dead stillness, one far crow flying
Where light made gold of its dingy wing.
(Ah, God, those paddocks so wide, so still !)

WRI THE DOWN
FOR THE BULLETIN
They had both tasted of the world’s loneliness,
and found in it an ache almost insupportable. That
was beyond the hills of many yesterdays and
before they had seen each other’s faces. Between
restlessness and recklessness they had set out to
try if loneliness in a strange country had fewer
heart-pangs than in one familiar. And they both
sailed south on the same ship.
Then it was that they first saw each other, and
it seemed to both from that day that they had
lived and been lonely and come away for this one
thing only.
They were neither of them people whom the
other passengers noticed much. She was a small,
slender thing, with eyes neither blue nor grey but
something perfect between, an unsymmetrieal
mouth and nose, and hands that had a nervous
clinging way about them. He was sun-tanned,
very thin, about 35 years old, and his clothes were
quite noticeably shabby.
Little discoveries about each other were con-
tinually going home to their hearts —neither of
them was sea-sick. They both took salt with
their porridge instead of sugar. They were both
fond of bacon for breakfast and marmalade for
tea. Every night for a space they trod the vessel’s
deck, alone, and then, leaning against the side,
gazed through the star - dust into the worlds
beyond, or into the sea-depths to mysteries and
fancies and longings—somewhere.
Once —it was at breakfast—she pushed away her
cup, and his eyebrows went up. “Neither hot
nor cold,” she explained, smiling.
“ Like the church of the Laodiceans,” he said.
After that lip-language came to them.
He learned that she had just come away from
the grave of her father, and she that the only
home in the world to which thought of his could
fly was in a small Sussex churchyard, where his
young sister slept.
Then the sympathetic cord around them
tightened.
She told him she was a governess, and was going
out to Australia because there were so few of them
there, and Loudon was quite full. And he told
h t that he was a clerk and was going to Australia
because he had heard the beginning of the way
into the world lay there.
After that they began steadily to forget that
they had been lonely. There was a beauty in the
thought that they two stood on the steps of the
world with never a third to watch or know. It
raised them "over the shoulders of those other
happy ones of many loves.
At last, hi the silence of one night-time, when
the waves were slushing about this, their one
home, they stopped together to gather in the har-
vest of all those sweet, slow, magnetic days, to
feel how perfect a plan was this of the great Piece-
mover’s, and to wonder how all the world-atoms,
since first there was light, had moved so grandly
on their paths that these their two ways should
fall so faultlessly together at last.
“i might have taken another boat,” she said,
“or you might never have come out at all.”
But iiis eyes were serene. “It was meant to
be,” he said. “ From the beginning of the world
God meant there .should be a You and a Me. It
was written down. Think what a difference it
would have made in the plans of the whole world
if we had not
loved each other!
Some one else
would have
loved you. You
would have
loved some one
else. One might
as well imagine
how the world
would get on
without the
moon. ”
For a while
they looked at
life just as it
came to them
day by day.
Then their per-
spective grew
longer. They
gazed as far for-
ward as a year.
“By that
time,” he said,
“I shall have
the little home
all ready. There
will be a sofa
and two arm-
chairs. And
there must be a
little garden for
you to run
through to meet
me in the even-
ings. Do you
see it all ?”
She saw it
through a rosy
haze, even to an
ant imacassar
over the arm-
chair.
“If it is in
the plans of the
world that we
are to live in
that little house
in a year,” she
said, “I sup-
pose we shall.
It would upset
all things if we
did not. But
suppose it is
written down
that we do not for’two years ; ”
He folded Ids arms round her and nodded over
the wafers.
“I am strong,” he said, “and where we are
going there is work for everyone. Can you wait a
year ? ”
But she laughed at a year, and told him, in a
stumbling, simple way with her lips and eyes, that
she could wait till all the years of her life should
be gathered into a sheaf and there were no longer
any days to be lived —If he could wait, too.
A year dropped away, slowly, haltingly, as if
every now and then it were hesitating- whether
not to run back a few months and start quite
young again. But it would have altered the plan
of things too much, so it just kept dragging on.
In Sydney there was a little nursery-governess.
She had an attic bedroom and a schoolroom on the
third story. She taught the children every day,
and bathed them every night. On Sundays she
went to church twice, and every Tuesday and
Saturday afternoon she gave up to darning socks.
She did not grumble, but on the night of her
birthday she made an entry in her diary to the
effect that she missed the ideality of life, someway.
She had a bundle of letters and she tied them
up with blue ribbon. Many people who have
“ missed the ideal ”do the same. They were all
in the same hand-writing and all dated from a
New South Wales inland town. All of them were
tender and spoke of life in the kindly, patient
terms of one not long tried. Most of them were
philosophic.
The last one said—“So, after all, in the Plan of
Things, little Waiter, we are not to rent that
house this year. I had not thought it would be so
long as next year till our move. But don’t look
backwards. We are only down that we may get
up.” His letters cheered her wonderfully. After
one such she had heart enough to have sung over
all the baskets of socks in Sydney.
But three more years fled. She was a nursery-
governess still and , she received £2l> a year. On
her last birthday she had written in her diary that
she could not understand life. But she drew much
strength every morning from a small volume of
Marcus Aurelius.
“ If one thinks one is happy, one is happy,” she
would say, and be surprised that life and happi-
ness could be so simple. But she could not make
that one other happy by merely imagining that he
was, so she shut her eyes to such possibilities for
herself.
He wrote now: “At times 1 cannot help
wondering at the seeming improvidence of Provi-
dence. There is so much work in the world I
could do well, and yet it misses me, or I miss it.”
Then lie was receiving £7 5 a year, for every
hour of his life from morning early till evening
late. At EaSter-time he took a second-class holi-
day excursion ticket and travelled a whole night
through to see her.
To her quick eyes he looked different —older.
There were many lines on his face. His hair was
thinner. She did a swift calculation—he was
almost 40, and she was 25.
She gave him weak tea in the school-room, and
th ick bread-and-bn tter.
“ You are not altered,” he said to her; “only
your eyes are grown older. Dear God, for a room
like this, and a warm hearth-stone by which to
set you ! ”
She remembered swiftly how once he had wished
for the little house and garden. She had been
living up to that for four yeai’s, Thenceforth she
thought only of' a one-roomed home with a
chimney-corner.
“ They have 15 rooms in this house,’’ sue said,
“and this is the ugliest and least liked, I think.
They would be surprised if they heard you.”
He went away again, and the dust of many to-
days dropped into their lives but could not cover
the thought of that brief holiday.
She was a woman with a wonderful capacity for
details, and here lay much of her contentment.
For four years now she had studied advertise-
ments telling of “small” or “genteel ” suburban
houses. For four years her charges had taken
frequent constitutionals where such houses mostly
were, and she had eyed them half affectionately,
half shamefacedly. They were, every one of them,
palaces of the earth to her.
Now, her imagination dealt in rooms. There
was ideality almost in the limitation. No hall to
wander in, no back-room to smoke or study in. It
was like walking “under one umbrella ” instead
of in a tarpaulined street. She had red curtains
at the window, a shelf for his books, a resting-
place for his pipe.
But the years dragged on—three more of them.
Now he wrote, “ There was a time when I thought
of all the opportunities in life for each man. Now
1 think of all the men in life for each opportunity.”
She remembered then that he was more than
10; recalled the lines on his face, the bend of
his shoulders, the little that was not grey of his
hair.
After her 29th birthday, she wrote in her diary,
“ Time is taking from us what Eternity can never
pay back. Once the thought hurt that we could
never be young together in life. Now there is a
fear that presses harder. We shall never be old
together. We shall live no life together at all—
but letter-life ! ”
She put away her bright ribbons —never very
many. She was so eager to stand there at his
hand—3o if he was 30, 40 if he was 40, 50 when
he should be 50. A strangely progressive conser-
vative piece of loving womanhood.
Another Easter-time he took a second-class
single ticket to Sydney, and travelled through the
night to see her.
She gave him weak tea, in the school-room,
once more, and thick bread-and-butter.
He watched her hands as she pushed the darn-
ing away, her eyes with their home-look in them.
“ The waiting has tried you, little woman,” he
said, “but we won’t look backward too much.
Do you remember when I longed for a room like
this to put you in ?”
She wondered then if he had out-lived that
wish. She said, “ I have been here ten years, but
am leaving now. The school-room party is going
to school.”
“That is well,” he said, watching hei. “It is
written down that we be married next week. We
must not disturb the scheme of things even for
your trousseau,”
And the glory of that minute was such that
eternity could hold no greater, though he was 45
and she was 30.
They were married the next week. He had
£ 130 a year, and his life was not insured.
But they found a little house with a scrap of a
garden in front, and they put into it two arm-
chairs and a sofa.
The morning after the wedding she went down
the path to the gate, holding on to his arm. And
a neighbour smiled to see him kiss her so tenderly.
For the prettiness had gone from her face, and his
hair was grey.
“ We’ve beaten old Time at last,” he said ; “ the
best of all life is the growing old together, little
comrade.” And he went away into the city dust
and noise.
In the evening she ran down the path to meet
him, as they had settled it all so comfortably ten
years before. Last evening they had hardly
finished being young, they were so glad and gay.
-To-night they were to start to grow old together.
The homeliness of the thought brought the song
to her lips.
The neighbour who had smiled at the morning
kiss came up. He told her that he had bad news,
but she almost laughed at him. There was no bad
news in the world for her now. Nothing but a
shining, glorious good. She smiled at him gently.
“Your husband,” he said, “has met with an
accident. It was a lift —there was some' bung-
ling— ”
She gasped—“ He is hurt ” —and her face grew
grey. But the neighbor shook his head. <
“He is—dead,” he said, kindly, judging the
sharpest hurt should fall first.
And so they did not even grow old together,
But perhaps that was all written down, too.

A Gleam of Blue.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.
I saw it once on the farther side
Of a lazily-lifting ocean wave
That suddenly broke in laughing pride
As the swimmer threw up his arms and cried r
And sank to an icy grave.
I saw it again through the dusty reel
When the cavalry charged on our waiting
square;
But the pale-blue glint of the sweeping steel,
That passed my sight in its downward wheel,
Was red when it rose to air.
Your smile is red like the flesh that spread
To the stroke, and white like the billow’s
rise ;
And the blue that bit till the strong soul fled,
And danced in glee o’er the drowned man's
head,
Is plain in your calling eyes.

A SNAKE STORY.


MALAYSIA
FOR THE BULLETIN
HER FATHER'S HEADS A BORNEAH
NIGHTMARE.
“ Pasa Antu 1” “A spirit hath passed !”
and M ilita’s agate beads rattled to her trembling,
as something swift and silent brushed past her
little brass-burdened ear. Again it came, a
wavering shadow in the moonlight, and now
Malita laughed : it was only a big brown goat-
sucker, after all !
The laugh was low, a mere ripple on the smooth
of midnight silence, but Tambat, awake and star-
gazing, heard it. Neither poet nor philosopher
was Tambat; he was an older institution than
either, the quidnunc; and, peeping from the
window in his nipa-thatch, he saw the dark form
gliding from hut-shadow to hut-shadow.
A woman ! —young, alone, and making stealthily
for the pangarang. Tambat’s portentous mouth
expanded in a grin that halved his pock-pitted
f ice. Here was the making of a pretty scandal !
In the pangarang—the “ head-house ” —slept the
bachelors of Surah ; in part to guard that sacred
citadel; in part to keep them out of amorous mis-
chief. And here was mischief going to them ! —
slim young mischief in bedang and bracelets, with
shining beads about its graceful neck, and long
hair streaming to its slender waist.
Out of his eager way exultant Tambat kicked
his slumbering wife, and soon across the moon-
strips a second shadow glided after the first. At
equal pace, with equal silence, went they, till close
before the girl—a black triangle on the moonlit
sky—the pangarang reared up its pointed roof.
* # #
Into the head-house loft, through many a
lifted roof-trap, the moonlight and the night-
breeze came together, and made between them a
grotesquer horror than ever pork-supped artist
dreamed of. Around the circle of the roof, in
close and curving rows, the grisly trophies hung ;
dim blots of greater darkness in the shadow, hut
starting out, in p itches where the white light fell,
into hideous caricature of humanity, with huge
blank orbits where were one time eyes, and shark-
mouth-; grinning to the moon in ghastly travesty
of laughter. Among them heads not yet too stale
to load the air with fulsome carrion smell; with
others, dry a id hollow, fantastically nodding to
the breeze that frisked where once the brains had
worked.
Into this monstrous death-scene came suddenly
a warm young life; Malita dropped lightly from
the roof and looked around with staring eyes of
fear. The sin ill was nothing to her jaunty little
Dyak nose ; the heads her long-lashed Dyak eye
regarded no more than so many cocoa-nuts. Col-
lectively, that is, for there was one particular
brain-case she had come to seek—her father’s,
lopped a month before to “open the mourning”
for a Surah chief. A score of miles, alone and
quaking, had she paddled up the Antu-haunted
Dubur, and it was the head-house Antu now she
dreaded, as thus, in the second morning hour, she
stood panting with the grinning dead above her
and the murderous enemies of her tribe asleep
below.
Not all asleep ! Boki’s even'ng meal of rotten
eggs and stinking blue-fish h d be in over-ample.
He floundered, snorted, and woke—awoke to hear
upon the floor above a sound too slight for any but
a savage ear. Again it came—a faint concussion
on the hard bamboo, and up rose Boki, spear in
hand, and noiseless as a cat. It might be an
Antu, he thought, or, worse still, a Buau ! But
then, again, it might be the Sibis, or the Batsas—
stolen in upon them to requite a hundred cruel
-slaughters of the past. Not as an old woman
was Boki going to be jeered at! For himself
would he see who was above—or what ! So Boki
laid down spear, took parang in teeth, and had
climbed a dozen notches of the ladder-post, when
—clump ! —came something on his ugly skull, and
down went Boki like a stone !
# # #
Malita, climbing like a monkey from cross-
piece to cross-piece, had found, ere long, her
father’s head. In one of the moonlit patches she
came on it—half baked, half putrid—but recognis-
able still, and breathless Malita, incautious in her
gladness, dropped hardly feather-like enough upon
the floor again with her prize. Into the darkest
comer, with the noiseless swiftness of the savage,
she sprang, and, cowering, listened. Had they
heard ? rvo sound came from below, but that
proved nothing, and intently from her corner she
watched the black ladder-opening the moon-
lit floor.
Ay, there it came ! —a head ! “ The body must
never follow,' thought Malita as up she sprang,
and, with a wild swing of the cord rove
through the paternal temples, brought
down the dead skull on the living one
with a crash that scared the flying-foxes
squeaking from the eaves and brought to
their feet in an instant the sharp-eared
slumberers below. Wondering much,
they poked and pushed the flaccid and
oblivious Bold, and, wondering more,
they heard descend upon the floor above
a pounding shower of heads. “ The
Antu ! ” whispered they, and, trembling,
turned their eyes away from the trap
down which a couple of the ghastly things
had rolled. But, then, the voice of Tarn-
bat, shrieking wildly from above, dis-
solved the spell.
“ Come up ! —come up hither, ye men
of Surah ! Ye are robbed ! —robbed, I
tell ye !—and by a woman !—sleepy-
headed sons of bats that ye are ! Come
up ! —come up !”
They went up, and Tambat told
them. How he had followed to the head-
house a woman of the Sibis, and how he
had climbed in at a roof - window after
her. How, missing his hold, he had
caught at, and broken, one of the head lines ;
and how, as he picked himself up from amongst
the fallen heads, he saw the woman vanish through
the roof again.
“ A head had she in her hand,” he said, in con-
clusion. “ Therefore, say I, ye are robbed, and
heavily will ye have to answer it to the Orang !”
Whereat the playful Tambat chuckled—but not
for long. Bold, with many a grunt and growl,
had picked up his wits again, and, no sooner had
he grasped the situation than, with a single word,
he brought the injudicious Tambat’s mirth to an
abrupt conclusion. “ Darkness !” was the word—
a Dyak equivalent, as Boki used it, “for “Dead
men tell no tales!” The rest agreed. What skull-
and-woman story was this, with which to insult
the intelligence of the bachelors of Surah ? And
if, as Tambat said, there was a head missing, his
own would just suit its place. It would be nicely
baked by the time of next official counting, and
no one would be the wiser !
Tambat implored—the head-watchers laughed ;
he cursed them—they knocked him down with a
kris-hilt; he shrieked—they gagged him with a
chawat, lugged him out into the jungle, and waited
for the sun to rise. With the first red rays they
took the chawat off, gave him a valedictory chew
of betel, calmly docked him of his head, buried it
for the time in a cane-patch, and pitched the car-
case to the ever-ready crocodiles.
* * *
Came round, in time, the ‘ ‘ counting of the
heads,” and Molat, the Orang-Kaya, found the
tally right. Quoth he
“Not for any other three would I lose this head
of Dipuk’s. He was a great man of the Sibis—on
whose tribe be curses ! Fresh is it, also, to a
wonder. Hardly seemeth it the head of more
than a moon and a-half !”
Which observation—seeing the head in question
had been exactly six weeks parted from the un-
lucky Tarabat’s shoulders —betokened upon Molat’s
part a thorough knowledge of the subject.
But Dipuk’s head, with Argus-feathers decked,
hung high in Malita’s house until she took a hus-
band. Me threw it to the pigs !
NO QUARTERI
Upon the low Javanese coast-village came
down the stifling darkness of a latitude that
knows no coolness —night Or day. The palm-
stems stood out black against the whiteness of the
surf, relieved, in turn, by a sable sea that hardly
answered to the swift blue gleams amongst
the piled-up fierceness in the west. Upon
a panting ocean and a gasping earth the
atmosphere lay dead.
Tamoka, watching the sky,
thought, “ Storm will there be,
and much darkness. That is
well!”
Dooshi, watching Tamoka,
thought, “ Thunder and rain
and great darkness. That is
ill! But I will follow !”
Anjam, blinking up between
them, said, “Much water;
good for the rice ! ” and fell
asleep over his cigar.
Anjam had four wives ; but
two of them didn’t count, be-
cause, like himself, they were
more antique than handsome.
The other two had, each, a fait
share of good looks and one child,
Tamoka’s, a sickly girl—Dooshi’s,’ a
sturdy male urchin, much valued of hit
father. With which father, neverthe-
less, the hatred between the mothers
had little concern —it was the
bitterer jealousy of prestige. Also,
it was the old story the one
had a secret of which the other
was in chase.
The first deep grumble came
across the sea. Dooshi woke
her lord, and, grumbling in his
turn, he waddled in-doors to his !
sleeping-mat. Dooshi, seated beside
him, kept one eye on her rival till
Tamoka, sliding suddenly down to
the beach, made off into the gloom,
Dooshi—of more substantial architecture—
had more difficulty with the ladder; but for a
friendly flash she would have lost the scent.
The broad, blue glimmer gave a glimpse of white
garments; Dooshi girded up her own and ran.
# # *
The raiu had come—and gone. The anti-iris
—the fabled upas-tree—dripped mournfully above
the door in the mouldering stockade, and Tamoka,
as she came forth, did not see the figure in its
shadow. But Dooshi stepped out —the lightning
showed her face —and for a minute the two fronted
each other in silence.
Said Dooshi, quietly, then —“ The place of
lepers ! ” Then, again, as the other made no
answer, “And thy child! —thy sickly brat!—it
will be thrust forth with thee, for this ! ”
“Thrust forth!” Tamoka echoed. “Why
should we be thrust forth ? There is no harm.”
Dooshi laughed as she flung away the hand the
other had placed upon her shoulder. “So little
harm that Anjam will cast thee from him like a
mangy dog—thou and thy leprous whelp ! What
man of these decaying wretches is its father ? ”
“No man of them, thou wanton woman ! It is
my mother who is here. ” Tamoka flung herself
upon the sodden ground. “ Have mercy, Dooshi,
thou hadst thyself a mother! ”
The lightning showed no mercy in the other
woman’s face. “ A mother had I,’ 5 she answered,
slowly ; “ but not hither would I have come to
see her. Igo ! Wilt thou come also—that I may
see Anjam spit upon thee for a leper and bid them
chase thee back hither with spears and curses ?’“
Tamoka sprang up and back. “ She-panther !
Hast thou no heart in thy body ? Wouldst thou
even come hither for thy child’s sake ? ”
“No !” Dooshi answered, and, with the word,
Tamoka leaped upon her. The two went down
amongst the soaking undergrowth, and there, like
tiger-cats, they fought in the lightning-broken
darkness till Tamoka, finding herself the weaker,
wrenched herself away and fled.
* * *
Dooshi had missed the track. The sun
was up when, with her tale, she came to Anjam.
He stopped her.
“The boy is gone,” he said. “Stolen whilst
thou wast away. Find him, thou; and that
speedily, or I will make of thee an example to all
wandering wives !”
Dooshi, rushing to and fro like a bereaved hen,
had a sudden inspiration that sent her back to her
angry spouse.
“Tamoka !” she had only time to say before
the old man, upsetting his morning rice, came at
her with his kris.
“ Find me the lad !” he called after her, as she
scurried down the ladder, “ then jabber of what
thou wilt!”
Dooshi took once more the track to the leper
village. “ Where that woman is,” she muttered,
“my child is.” But, presently, by the wayside,
she found Tamoka, waiting and alone.
“My child !” Dooshi cried, grasping at the
other’s arm, “My boy, Hagai, where is he?”
And Tamoka, pointing backwards, said, “Thy
boy, woman of no mercy, is where thou didst say
thou wouldst not follow him. I left him in a
leper-woman’s bosom !”
Without another word Dooshi was off—striking
against trees and tumbling over creepers in her
frantic haste—until, bleeding and panting, she
stood and smote fiercely upon the door in the
stockade. A man opened it; a creature so woe-
begone and dreadful that she started back ; but
then, remembering her errand, she rushed past
him into the enclosure.
Upon a miserable mango-tree in the centre a
couple of tame monkeys grinned and chattered,
and, clinging head-downwards to the bark, a
hideous hydrosaurus lizard sunned itself—unsoared
among a people too intimate with death to kill,
ahe air was foul with stench from stagnant pool
and rotten refuse, and a rank, green slime was on
the crazy huts from which, here and there, the
doomed looked out and wondered at this woman
rushing to and fro with breathless questionings
about her child. No children there, they said,
save two or three who had been born into horror.
But, if she would venture, she might search the
huts.
She ventured—as Tamoka had known she
would—until, in one dark hovel, a ghastly relic of
a woman, coming unawares upon her, fell upon
her neck and kissed her thrice.
“Greeting to thee, Dooshi ! ” croaked the crea-
ture. “ Tamoka’s mother am I!—ho !ho ! ” At
which Dooshi, shuddering, fled through the outer
gate and away.
And then, again, she met Tamoka—triumph in
her eyes, and the boy in her arms.
“In the jungle I had him hidden!” she said.
‘ Amongst the lepers he hath not been. But thou
hast—aha ! And my mother kissed thee, did she,
as I told her. And whom will Anjam spit upon,
now ? ”
The maddened Dooshi dashed at her, and, heed-
less of the screaming boy, the two rolled over and
over. But not for long. Tamoka, when she took
the boy, had also taken a kris
“‘ No!' Dooshi answered, and, with the word ,
Tamoka leaped upon her,”
It was her turn to show no quarter!
Then, with the lad, she went to Anjam and told
him all.
lie half-drew his kris then sheathed it again.
“Thy mother is thy mother!” he said. “iwill
not slay thee ; but take now thy girl and get thee
to thine own people. Well is it written —‘Women
are the gifts of the Devil!’ ”
SWAMP-SWALLOWED.
Across the long perspective of the man-
grove flats the sun glared fierce and crimson.
From the black mud-banks white, pestilential
vapors rose upon the torpid air. A subtler miasm
quivered over the long stretches of mephitic ooze,
against the sickly green of which gleamed out the
hideous reds and yellows of fantastic crabs that
scuttled- -as the boat came near—into pools pris-
matic with stagnation. Beneath the slimy surface
the banded water-snakes glanced to and fro :
from the reed-beds came in hungry swarms the
tiger-mosquitoes; and from the mangrove-roots the
sword-flies darted out in swift detachments upon
the half-nude rowers—sweltering in a bath of
vegetable fetor.
Of the white men one would have fired at the
log-like immobility of a crocodile basking un-
troubled of that “ instinctive terror of man ”
which is but one of man’s own anthropocentric
delusions. But the other said, “No !” He was a
tan-faced old fellow with a wide, grim mouth and
stiff, white, ape-like whiskers.
“ Fire a shot here and we may as well go back !
Curious acoustics, these places have. The report
of a gun wanders up and down the swamps and
creeks as if it was never going to stop !”
“ You’ve been here before, then?”
“Wouldn’t be here now if I hadn’t, and if I
didn’t count myself fever-proof. But as for you,
Green . ”
Green—young and smooth-faced, but big, brick-
red, and square-jawed—cut in, “ No more of me,
old man! I’ll see this thing through ! And,
anyhow, if I'm not fever-proof, I’m pretty well
past praying for by this time ! See ?”
“I see you’re good stuff, at any rate! And
nothing else will do for this job. Let’s sum up—
leaving out such trifles as heat and insects. Fever,
snakes, sunstroke, poisoned arrows from the
Dyaks, treachery from these chaps of our own,
and, after all— -perhaps nothing at the end of it!”
“I’m game for all but the last. Heavens 1
Redfern, that would be a crusher. ”
“ Crusher?” Redfern leaned over to the young
fellow. “This is it. I’m five-and-sixty; here’s
my first chance of a pile, and I’ve staked on it
whatever’s left me, say 10 or 15 years. It’s worth
it. But, you—you might have lived for 70 years,
yet.”
“ Confound it, man, you talk as if it was all up
with me. My chance is as good as yours, at all
events. ”
The other man said nothing. He had private
reasons for being of a different opinion.
* * *
Through pallid, steam - like mist—the
visible breath of Death—the rising moon made
faint light for the two men groping in the stinking
mud, and shrinking, now and then, from the
horrid, unnamed things their hands encountered.
For half-an-hour they toiled, till to the knees and
elbows they were foul with evil-smelling filth.
Then Green gave up.
( ‘ ‘ This is the place, right enough, ” he said—-
“ according to your map. T tangle between three
creeks ; gravel bluff at one end ; three mangroves
in the middle. And between them we’ve searched
nearly every inch. If your friend Kussoab wasn’t
a first-class liar, he was mad ! Either way, it’s—
ugh !” Something was wriggling from the mud
between his feet, and, springing smartly from the
spot, he slipped and fell backwards.
“ It’s only a goocha !” Redfern kicked the fish-
like saurian ten feet away. “ What a fool you
are ! Hullo ! —are you hurt ?”
For Green lay where he had fallen—not hurt,
but thinking hard. One hand, as he came down,
had touched a stone, and any stone, in that abso-
lutely rockless region, must be the stone they
sought—the stone which covered the treasure he
had till now but half-believed in. And with belief
came greed and quick resolve. A part!—he would
have all! “This old man’s day is past!— mine’s to
come ! And what I mean for him, no doubt, is
no more than he meant for me !”
All this in the ten seconds before Redfern
helped him to his feet. “ Let’s get back to the
boat,” Green said, then, “for the present, at any
rate. I feel infernally queer. ”
Back to the boat they picked their squelching
way, the elder man puzzled, but not yet sus-
picious. It was when they had drunk of the
“ gunny - water ” made of rum and quinine
that a glimmer of the truth came to Redfern, the
more readily that he had himself determined, if
the find were made, to “ lose ” his partner in this
hellish wet wilderness of Manduka. For thus
together do the wits of scoundrels jump.
* * *
Thicker still the ghastly fever-fog hung
round the shadowy boat, but the moon was in
mid-heaven and the light had increased,
when Green sat up and looked around
the boat—silent, but for the snoring of
the wearied Malay rowers. Neither was
there visible the inevitable cheroot-
glow which would have told of Redfern’s
wakefulness. Green stole from under the awning
and over the side.
Redfern, a minute later, raised his head and
listened —then took his rifle and slipped also away
into the half-illumined mist, which immediately
thereafter yielded up a dusky figure that got
hastily into the boat and woke its fellows, for the
Malay crew had, since dark, been one man short
—a secret watch upon the doings of the whites.
Then, by the light of a little cocoa-nut lamp, six
swarthy faces gloated over a broken kris —the
fragment of the blade rust-eaten to a rugged
skewer, but the hilt, of damp-defying gold, set
thick with stones that sparkled even through the
clinging slime.
# # #
The frogs forbore their raucous chorus-
alarmed by Redfern’s strident laughter.
“ What a guileless innocent you take me for !
You sneak back here when you think I’m asleep,
and you show me a hole that ” —with a sneer
“ somebody else made ! Really, now, young man
—which is to say, young scoundrel ! young thief !
you might credit me with some brains'. ”
Green stamped up a shower of mu I. “ Scoundrel
yourself ! Brains or no brains !—there’s the hole,
and I didn’t make it. And, besides, if I found
anything, where is it ? ”
Redfern threw up his rifle. “ Exactly !” he
said. “ That’s what I want to know. Where is
it?”
Green stooped his head. “Listen!” he said,
“there’s your answer !”
A hurried sound of oars came faintly through
the sluggish air, and both men made off, stumbling
and squattering in their haste to reach the main
creek.
They were too late ! A scornful yell from far
away in the fog was all that answered to their
shouts.


With the earliest grey of morning Redfern
sprang from the mangrove-root on which he had sat
silent for hours. “Come!” he said, “let’s get
away from here, at all events. Getting out of the
Manduka’s another matter !”
Green slowly raised himself from the mud and
lit his pipe. “ What chance is there of that ?” he
asked sullenly.
“ About one in a hundred !” Redfern answered,
belying his belief, for he was a man of
science, not ill-versed in jungle-craft, and he
thought the odds were in favour of his own escape
—unhampered by a tyro’s company.
He eyed his double-rifle as he headed westward
through the dreary, dripping mangroves. His
cartridges—save the two in the barrels—had gone
with the boat. “ I could not spare a bullet, even
if ” The'other called him, and he turned.
Green, up to his ankles in
mud, was dragging out each foot
in turn —only to sink the other
deeper as his weight came on it.
And the up-turned stuff—though
the surface was a glossy green—
was of a dirty saffron hue. A
“ porridge-pot,” Redfern knew it for,
and, on the instant,
turned and made off.
This—without his in-
tervention would
rid him of his in-
cumbrance, though
to see the poor
wretch slowly
perish there was
no need. But —
blindly rushing
from the other’s
cries—a word
came to his ear
that stopped
him.
“The kris!
the kris!
I have it,
after all!”
Redfern
sped back to
where the
struggling
Green with
wild eyes
starting from
his fear-
blanched
face was clawing frantically at the viscid
horror that, by this time, held him to the
middle. Testing with his rifle-butt, Redfern
swiftly found the limit of the fatal “porridge,”
and, flinging himself full length upon the firmer
ground, thrust out the barrels to the utmost.
“ What did you say about the kris ?” he panted,
as he lay.
“ I have it!” Green gasped, as he got one hand
on the muzzles. “If I sink, it sinks with me !”
And, lying thus for life, he plucked the rifle
towards him—and the piece, exploding, sent its
bullets through his neck. Then Redfern, stretch-
ing eagerly to reach Green’s inside pocket—was
caught himself.
For twenty horrible minutes he fought, and
prayed, and swore, and yelled to earless solitudes.
And, when the noise had ceased, a monstrous
green batrachian —squatting on the double grave—
croaked solemnly that all was well!
“TO OBLIGE VANDORKENI”
Physiognomically, Yandorken was unfor-
tunate. Nature had provided him with the type
of head and face which is commonly, and, in the
main, oorreotly, associated with the more pro-
miscuous sort of amativeness. But, of the many
exceptions, Yandorken was one. His thick, red
nape meant nothing more than a large, good-
humored stupidity; the affection in his loose,
moist eye was but an affection for the kirschwasser
which, in long-continued doses, had relaxed his jowl
and thickened out his lower lip from beneath the
grizzled-ginger moustache. But his brother-
planters—knowing that in his freedom from the
kindred weakness he stood alone amongst them —
had, with humorous accord, conferred upon him
the title and the reputation of Don Juan. In
which way it came about that one night, at the
tail of a symposium chez Yandorken, the ebriously
facetious Bronker, getting unsteadily to horse,
hiccuped forth with incautious loudness ;
“ Good-night, you gay old dog ! Good-night,
my bold Don Juan ! —and beware the fate of your
namesake! ”
Yandorken shook his fist after the departing
Bronker. “ Idiot! ”he muttered. “If my wife
hasn’t heard you I’m in luck.”
He wasn’t. “And who,” quoth Vrow Vandor-
ken, suddenly, “was he? —Don Juan, I mean.
And why did that tipsy ass call you by his name ?
And what was his fate ? ”
Which trinity of questions so confounded the
unready Yandorken that, with match in one hand
and his final cigar in the other, he merely stood
and stared at her with his mouth open.
The lady, lean, acidulous, and older than her
mate, closed hers with a snap. “ Never mind !”
she said, “ It’s of no consequence !” With which
she went to bed, and Yandorken, smoking medi-
tatively amongst the fireflies, cursed exceedingly
the injudicious Bronker, and knew that there was
trouble ahead.
* * *
In the Netherlands, in Africa, in Guiana,
in the Indies—wherever you find the Hollander,
you find the most hospitable of men. A casual
introduction to Yandorken, in Bantam, and a
trifling incidental conversation, made me as wel-
come to him as the sea-breeze in the morn-
ing. None the less so, possibly, that the relations
between his vrow and himself were, even to the
unaccustomed eye, so palpably “ strained ” that
the stranger within them gates made early resolve
to get outside them again as soon as decency
would let him. And hugely was that stranger—
myself—astonished at the question sprung upon
him by his hostess, almost before the solemn,
white-robed mandoer had whisked the cover off
the soup. _ , ,
“Did you ever hear, Mynheer Englander, of
anybody called Don Juan ?”
Mynheer Englander, not without boggling,
replied that he certainly had heard of such a per-
son ; and, thereafter, being further interrogated,
euphemistically explained that the gentleman in
question had been credited with unconventionally
easy notions of morality.
But I wasn’t to escape that way !
“As regards,”said this uncompromising female,
“ as regards the other sex, I presume ?”
“ Hang it all !”• I thought, “ if the old girl’s so
plain, I don’t see why I should shirk it ! Yes,” I
said, “ the legend makes him out one of the most
unconscionable rakes and rascals that ever walked
the earth.”
And then—by the lady’s spite-laden glance at her
husband, as by the husband’s purple cheeks and
swollen eyeballs;—l saw that I had “ done it
though how, I hadn’t the remotest idea, till in the
creeper-clad verandah I sat and smoked with
Yandorken at midnight.
“ It wasn’t your fault,” my host said ruefully ;
“ how could you know? But the fact is that ever
since she got hold of that infernal nickname she’s
been three times as jealous as before. And that,”
added Yandorken, with doleful reminiscence, “is
saying a good deal!”
“But, till to-night, she didn’t understand the
allusion.”
“ She suspected, my friend. And, now that she’s
sure, I won’t even be able to look at a woman on
the plantation 1”
“Perhaps—between men, you know !—perhaps
you have been looking at some of them a little too
“ The piece, exploding, sent its bullets through
his neck."
freely already ? Some of these Javanese girls are
very pretty.”
My host’s bamboo chair creaked under the
energy of his disclaimer.
“ Tuyfel, man ! —not I ! I wouldn’t care if there
wasn’t a woman on the face of the earth. The
fellows —devil take ’em ! —only gave me the name
on the what-d’ye-call-it—oh ! the lucus a non prin-
ciple. All the heart I’ve got’s in my tobacco —
growing, stripping, curing, and turning out the
best brand on this side of Jojorka. And smoking !
As for the wenches who work at it —some of ’em
pretty enough, as you say —I don’t believe I know
one from the other. ”
“All which,” I told myself, as I drew my mos-
quito-net for the night, “ sounds uncommonly like
protesting too much.”
* * *
It was a pleasant place, the drying-house
—with its grateful shadows darkened into indigo
by sharp, intersecting shafts of blinding tropic
sunlight; its subtly pungent atmosphere, laden
with nicotian aroma and the chatter of busy,
bright-clad girls—some slinging the green tobacco
to poles across the shed, some piling the yellowed
bundles upon bamboo frames, some pressing and
packing the matured brown leaf into mats and
boxes. Good-looking girls, many of them, in the
somewhat squab-featured Malaysian style, and
one, at least, an unquestionable beauty, even
according to European canons.
“She?” Yandorken answered to my question.
“Oh, that’s Halmaheira!” And Halmaheira,
looking up with a smile, showed us a wide white
mouthful of ivory, unstained of the accursed betel.
“Ha, friend Yandorken !” I said, “here’s one
you know from the others, at all events !”
The honest fellow blushed, as far
as brick-red would let him. “ Well,
she—she’s a kind of fore-woman,
you see. That’s prime stuff for my
own use she’s doing up in plantain-
leaf. Just go over and have a look
at it.”
I went over, but for once that I
looked at the weed, I looked a dozen
times at the fair manipulatrix there-
of ; and she, with laughter in her
long black eyes, made good her title
to that intermediate status between
coquetry and impudence for which
tire mysterious term “minx” ap-
pears to have been invented.
“ You’re a pretty girl, Hal-
maheira, with a pretty name,” I
said to myself, “ but you’re a
minx, for all that! And, perhaps,
after all, Mrs. Yandorken ”
A sudden widening of Halma-
heira’s velvet eyes made me look
round. J ust within the shed stood
Mrs. Yandorken herself, with a
white cotton umbrella accentuating
the leathery sourness of her face.
Yandorken’s surprise had stiffened
him into a ludicrous suggestion of a
soldier at “ ’tention five hundred
busy fingers had forgotten their
function, and a hundred sloe-black
eyes spoke blank astonishment; but
only of myself did Mrs. Yandorken
take the slightest notice—walking
straight up to where I stood
sheepishly flapping my cheek with
a leaf from Halmaheira’s table.
“ I congratulate you on your
taste, mynheer!”—indicating the
girl with a lean, yellow fore-finger,
“It is good; but unfortunately
you are not alone in it. lam sure
you would not willingly commit a
breach of hospitality, so it is but
fair to warn you that you are at this moment
poaching on your host’s preserves - !” Bho waved a
hand towards her husband and stalked solemnly
away.
Yandorken looked stupidly after her; I looked
at Halmaheira; Halmaheira laughed aloud, and
round the other girls went the gentle ripple of a
smile. Down to the little 10-year-old fly-flapper,
there wasn’t one of them that hadn't grasped the
situation.
* # »
“ You’ll have to get rid of the fair Halma-
heira,” I advised. “No peace till you do !”
Yandorken gazed out over the reed-beds for a
minute before he answered, disconsolately ;
“ Exactly ; but I’m not sure that she’d go !”
I looked hard at him. Was there anything
sub-rosd, after all ?
“No, no !” he answered to my inquiring eye.
“ Not that! It’s this way ! This Halmaheira’s a
mischievous little animal. She’d stop at nothing
to spite my wife —or myself, either, after I’d sent
her about her business. She’d keep hanging
round, and turning up at awkward times—making
things ten times worse for me, in fact!”
Yandorken mopped his face and groaned—then,
with a s iddeu brightening-up—
“ Hemell—l have it I You’re going back to
Bantam, aren’t you ?”
“ Yes ; what’s that to do with it ?”
“Everything, my friend ; you’ll take her with
you !”
I laughed at him. “Declined with thanks,” I
said.
Yandorken chucked away his cigar among the
crocodiles, and nearly tumbled me into the tank
after it, so eagerly did he clutch me by the arm.
“ You don’t understand ! Here’s what I mean!
Halmaheira will go with you readily enough ; the
notion of a white husband would fetch any girl in
Java.”
“Daresay ; but ”
“Wait! Of course you’re not going to marry
her —needn’t even speak to her on the journey !
You’ll be on horseback, and I’ll send her in a
tandoe. And I’ll give you a cheque on De Rioter’s
for 500 guilders, which you can hand over to her.”
“Very tidy solatium, too! Well, Yandorken,
it’s a middling steep business ; but you’re a good
sort —so, if you think the money’ll do instead of
the man ”
“She’ll jump at it, sir! No disparagement to
you, but she’ll simply jump at the cash.”
# * *
With Yandorken’s parting words in my
ears, I was easy enough in mind till I dismounted
at the door of Portegra’s and was struck dumb
by the appearance of my charge as she emerged
from her tandoe. I had only hi herto seen her in
working trim, for it had been dark when we left,
and at the rest-houses I had carefully avoided her;
but, now, here she was in a gold-embroidered
kabaya of blue Bugis silk, with a silver skewer
through her ebony top-knot, broad gold stripes in
her muslin sarong, and big silver butterflies on her
little red slippers. It was simply gorgeous, and
her eyes were truly very fine and dangerously
reproachful., Yet I tried to harden my heart, got her
into the hostelry, and made straight for De Rinter’s
—whence, with the 500 guilders (about .£4O) at
which my damsel was to “jump,” I sauntered
contentedly back—glad to be done with an un-
pleasant job.
» * *
But Halmaheira didn’t “jump” —didn’t
show the remotest inclination to skip. In the best
Javanese at my command I explained, and ex-
plained again ; and still, without a word, she kept
gazing mournfully from the money to the man and
from the man to the money. And still I talked,
and felt every moment more and more mixed and
mean and idiotic, until I went mentally to pieces
as the lady, with a soft smile spreading like the
dawn across her puzzled features, pushed back the
coin-representing rags, and calmly observed that
it was proper for the husband to have charge of
the money.
“The husband !” In something not unlike
despair I looked around. It was the native
section of the hotel, and, from the other
end of the room a portly old Javanese gentle-
man was considering us, not unsuspiciously,
through gold-rimmed glasses; while, nearer at
hand, two women of the upper-class—more richly,
if less garishly attired than my incubus—were
regarding her askance with all the fine super-
ciliousness proper to that circumstance. For which
reason Halmaheira—having, woman-like, observed
them without looking—determined, I suppose, to
take the wind out of their sails by showing them
what the person they despised might, could, and
would do with one of the august white race. Up
she jumped, at all events, and, before I altogether
realised that I had been energetically folded to
her blue-silk bosom, I was being kissed upon
either cheek with a rapidity and resonance that
drove the astounded Javanese ladies to the other
end of the room, where one of them, tumbling
over the petrified old gentleman, set up a screech
that brought waiters on the scene —then old
Portegra himself, with a couple of grinning Dutch

“ Verdoemnis ! ” said one—“the Englander’s

made much of me ! My cup was full, and I fled.

The Rajah’s
[FOR THE BULLKTIN.]
In my garden, O Beloved 1
Many pleasant trees are growing,
Peach and apricot and apple,
Myrtle, lilac and laburnum.
Fair are they, but midst them lonely,
Like an exiled Eastern Princess
In a strange land far from kindred.
Stands a lonely fair Pomegranate,
Dreaming of its native Orient,
Always is the fair Pomegranate,
And beneath it I lie dreaming
Of thine eyes and thee, Beloved 1
Overhead its red globes gleaming
Like red moons, old tales recall of
Eastern moons and songs of Hafiz —
Nightingales and wine and roses.
And, at whiles, it seems a mystic
Tree Oircean whose red fruit is
Broken hearts of old-time lovers,
Their sad secrets once more telling.
And within each red sun-cloven
Glossy globe, like unto little
Hearts within a great heart glowing,
Glow translucent seeds of crimson.
Like the fruit of the Pomegranate
Pull of little hearts my heart is,
And the little hearts so glowing
They are thoughts of thee, Beloved 1
Hapily these at times are woven
In with dreams of the Pomegranate :
Thus, perchance, I dreamt the curious
Dream within a dream here written.
• . » • • •
In his palace-hall, methought, I
Saw a splendid Indian Rajah ;
Fame and Fortune were his vassals,
But his heart was sad within him.
’Round him stood his chiefs and captains.
“Great art thou,” they cried, “ O Rajah >
And thy hand is strong in battle.”
But he smiled not at their speeches.
Silently through his Zenana
Passed he, glanced with cold and careless
Eyes at women, fair as houris
Seen in visions bred of hasheesh.
Like to dawn, and noon, and starry
Night—like all the moods of passion—
Were they—rose-and-white Circassians,
Amber Hindoos, dark-eyed Persians,
Dancing girls with golden armlets,
Golden rings around their ankles—
Making music clear, melodious
As the plash of crystal fountains
Heard in still, hot nights of summer—
Danced the Lovers’ Dance before him.
But he heeded not their dancing.
For his heart was sad within him.
Thence unto his treasure-chamber
Strode he—there to gaze on gems that
Rajahs dead had won and hoarded ;
Tragic-storied, splendid jewels—
Diamonds, like fallen stars, for
Whose bright evil beauty blood in
Old days had been spilt, enough to
Make them burn like crimson rubies ;
Emeralds greener than Spring’s garments,
Pearls like unto tears of Peris
Weeping by the gates of Eden ;
Opals with their fateful lustre.
Long on these, and countless other
Many-coloured gems, the Rajah
Gazed, but found no more delight in
Their sun-flashing brilliant beauty.
He had dreamt a dream enchanting
Of twin-sapphires, blue as Heaven,
And his heart was filled with hunger
And with yearning to possess them.
Therefore unto his Vizier he
Told his dream, and gave command that
He should seek, the wide world over.
Till he found the wondrous sapphires.
Doth that sad Vizier still wander
O’er the earth the sapphires seeking ?
Sooth I know not —but I know that
He will never find them, never?
For they were no cold, bright sapphires
That the Rajah in his dream saw . . .
Waking from my dream I knew that
They were thy blue eyes. Beloved,
VICTOR J. JELKY.


THE J ADO CING OF
JACCER
FOR THE BULLETIN
When the 30th Dragoon Guards lay in
Ahmednagar, East India, private dohn dagger
was the smartest soldier in the smartest regiment
if the British army.
On these points there could be no doubt, because
Major Muller (commanding the 30th during the
ibsence on leave in England of Lieut.-Col.
“Jacky” Tulwar) affirmed them daily, and many
times a day, to the fatigue of officers and men.
In every corps is one man held by his com-
manding officer to be the sealed pattern of all
military excellences. These, in the cavalry and
in time of peace, include a small head, broad
shoulders and chest, flat back, slim waist, long
legs, and a swagger as of lord of all the earth.
Such virtues dagger had, adding thereto six feet
three inches of height, straw-colored hair, bulging
blue eyes, a big moustache, a pink complexion and
countenance. His enemies—envy ever
dogs perfection—swore he could not ride, and
likened him to a “sack of sand tied up ugly.”
But the Major, reared in a foot regiment, had
for the unsightly equitation of his favorite the
fellow-feeling which makes wondrous kind.
* * *
Before “ Jacky,” as officers and men called
him, went on leave—he had only been gone four
months —Shoeing-Smith Ned Fee was esteemed
the pattern man of the 30th. He was a most
running worker in iron. All that might be done
with a hunk of metal and a horse’s foot he did.
He rode superbly, and anything. ‘ ‘ That sahib talks
the bat of the horse and the horses talk to him, ”
said the troop yhorawalas. “The dead spit of a
dragoon,” was the verdict of those rigid critics, his
comrades. Slight, yet powerful, five-feet-ten in his
hoots, trimmest of soldiers, and, for a white man,
a wonderful swordsman, Shoeing-Smith Fee was
from top to toe the ideal cavalryman. His skin
was nearly as dark, and his features quite as clear-
cut, as the skin and features of a high-class
Brahmin. The blood in his veins was gypsy blood.
He loved and hated as gypsies love and hate. And
“ Jacky ” counted him as the pearl of price among
farriers and troopers.
But the Major, like greater autocrats when they
come to rule, broke, of malice and lust of power,
such of his predecessor’s idols and laws as. might
with safety be broken. He abased Fee and exalted
dagger. The latter marked his rise by an osten-
tatious bumptiousness which would have ensured
a smaller man many and painful thumpings. Ned
took his downfall, as he took all things, calmly.
Yet in many ways were rubbed into him his
inferiority and the superiority of the new favorite.
Both were in “A ” Troop. When that troop
came under the Major’s inspecting eye he failed
not to publicly berate Fee and belaud dagger. It
would be: “Your puggaree, sir, looks like a
damned debased sausage. Fold it as dagger folds
his !” Or: “ Why the devil don’t you wear your
forage-cap properly? Look at Private dagger !
He’s a pattern to the regiment. You look like a
half-baked militiaman, by God —you, Fee !” After
one of these diatribes the mutinous spirits in “ A ”
Troop would look sympathetically at Fee and
murmur, “ Oh, damn Private dagger !” But Ned
said nothing and looked nothing.
There were other trials of his temper. A great
assault-at-arms was announced to be held at
Poonah. Every regiment in the Presidency would
compete. The 30th were to send a man from each
troop. The barrack-rooms unanimously decided
that Fee, as the very best man in the corps, must
go. He did not go. The Major selected dagger
in his place. The latter took two prizes for minor
events. But the pride of place the 30th con-
fideptly counted on, had Fee been a competitor,
fell* to a much-scorned Hussar regiment. Yet the
Major, attended perforce by the band and volun-
tarily by his courtiers, went out long miles to meet
the returning detachment, dagger rode into can-
tonments on the Major’s charger, the superior
officer striding alongside, holding the private’s
stirrup-leather, while the band played “See the
Conquering Hero,” and the bandmaster thrust his
tongue into his lean cheek, and was inaudibly
blasphemous.
# * •
Shortly afterwards, one of England’s cruel,
twopenny-halfpenny wars was imminent. The
Major, by sweat ol Jaw, wrung a promise
from the Commander-in-chief that, m case
of hostilities, a wing of the 30th should
participate. Whereon the regiment went
crazed with blood-thirst, or the desire of
change at any price. What troops were to form
the service-wing ? what men were to belong to that
wing ?—these were the questions unceasingly and
hotly debated in bungalows, the sergeants’-mess,
and the canteen. They were soon set at rest.
“A ” troop, among others, would not go. Selected
men would be drafted from non-service to service
troops. Private dagger was among the elect. S.
S. Fee was not.
Th© night the final arrangements were published
in regimental orders, the 30th went on a wild
whooping tear, preparatory to sobering up for the
campaign. When the men of “A ” troop —all dis-
orderly, some half and others frankly drunk —
returned to their bungalow from bazars and the
canteen, dagger, mostly fairly temperate, partly
because his head was soft, chiefly because his dis-
“ Neither spoke. Private Jagger's eyes were very curious
position was saving, was pot-valiant. His normal
pinkness had merged into boiled-lobster tint. As
asual, the blare of his own trumpet was blustrous.
Fee sat quietly on his cot and smoked reflectively.
Then “ Skew ” Evans —smallest and most mis-
chievous man in the troop, Fee’s chum and a hater
of dagger, whose cuticle was never proof against
Skew’s mosquito stings—explained sweetly, to no
one in particular, but for public benefit :
“Service-troops, indeed ! Service-troops be
rammed, jammed, and double-damned ! They’ve
been made up of all the hugliest and hawkwardest
men—the regimental helephants with glanders and
farcy, wot the major wants killed horf before the
regiment goes ’Ome.”
“ Blind me ! Do you mean that for me?” bel-
lowed dagger.
“ Take it any bloomin’ way yer likes, Gerliarth,”
said Skew, with the languid hauteur of a little and
impudent man.
Jagger plunged up the bungalow, proposing to
“ knock that there Skew’s infernal ’ead hoff.”
But, when he let out viciously at the small man,
who dodged scathless, Ned Fee put down his pipe
and stood up before the bully:
“ You hit me —hit a full-sized man, Jagger, for
a change like 1 ”
Jagger paled, scowled, and, speechless, made as
if to stalk away, while Fee, smiling, resumed his
seat and pipe.
Hardly had he turned his back when Jagger,
wheeling, struck him a crashing blow behind the ear
which knocked him senseless athwart his cot.
Skew, howling with rage, tore his carbine from
■thth, butt k desperately at JaggerB head
W tt Zm a • 4. i. u i j-i • i. • i .
Had aim and intent been equal this story might
have closed here, and Private Jagger might have
been saved some future trouble ihe carbine fell
on his shoulder like a horse s kick and took all fight
out of him. It was good for Jagger that yust
then the troop sergeant-major, rather ful of drink
and very full of discipline, came in and ordered
every man to his cot.
Skew quietly brought his chum to. There 11
be merry hell to pay to-morrow. Ned will kill
that great hulking beastly coward, Jagger,” was
Skew s final comment as he rolled himself in his
camel s-hair blanket.
Next morning, after Skew had breakfasted,
cleaned his saddle and burnished his accoutre-
ments, he loafed down to the forge where Fee was
fitting a shoe to a horse s foot and not the foot to
the shoe. When are we gom to thump that
swme Jagger, eh, Ned • _ _
Fee went calmly on with his work. “ There’ll
fight just now,” he said.
“ Wh-a-a-t ? ”
“It’s beer-time ; go down to the canteen and
get drunk, you little beggar, and don’t come
growling here. There’s plenty of time for dagger’s
business—better ways than fighting. Wait a bit !”
This was a long speech for Fee.
Skew cut up some plug tobacco slowly and
scientifically, rubbed it between his palms medi-
tatively, filled his pipe with agile thumb and fore-
finger, and lit it with a red-hot iron. He knew
something of his chum’s disposition. A light
broke upon him, and he went away whistling
softly. “ Ned’s up to some of his gypsy hanky-
panky. God help Jagger !” he muttered, and bore
up for his midday beer with placid mien and
healthy thirst.
# # *
Perhaps Httie Skew al °ne, and he dimly,
comprehended why Fee suddenly went on the
spree, or, at least, commenced to spend money
freely at the canteen—which was not his custom.
Not even the sagacious Skew divined why, one
night soon after the quarrel, Ned, a big pot of
rum slightly diluted with hot coffee in hand,
walked up to Jagger and invited him to “drink
hearty.”
To this invitation there were, considering the
relations of the two men, but two possible answers
—refusal and prompt war, or acceptance.
dagger’s conceit obviated the former. He under-
stood the proffered pot to be a natural and proper
tribute to his worth. He drank affably and
heartily. Thenceforward a friendship appeared
to exist between the late rivals. Presently they
went on shooting excursions to the canteen and
bazars together, while all their little world
wondered, and Skew was green with the bile of
jealousy.
Jagger and Fee left barracks one afternoon in
company. The former had taken to drinking a
good deal, in a circumspect way, at Fee’s expense.
He was feeling the effects. Ned admitted a “sore
head.” He knew where some liquor might be had
“on the sly.” They-Struck across the dry and
dusty maidan by a path unknown to Jagger, and
came out in a tope of trees in which were two small
huts—one at either end. Said Fee, “In one of
these is a native who sells brandy. I don’t know
in which one. Go to the further hut and see if
the black pig is there. I’ll look in here !”
* * *
There was a sensation in “A ” troop at
roll-call that night—private dagger was “ absent
without leave.” There was a pattern man,
indeed ! There was the Major’s pet ! And the
Major had sworn that any man guilty of the
slightest offence should not go on active service !
He had sworn it by several gods and many devils.
Long after “Lights out” “A” troop discussed
this astounding event excitedly, but without
sympathy for dagger. Skew leaned over from his
cot and whispered to Ned :
“What ’ave you done with the swine—knocked
’im on’s soft, squashy ’ead, and buried him ?”
“What do I know?” said Ned, carelessly.
“ He left me in the bazar."
dust before orderly-room next morning dagger
turned up. nuit.e Br>Vw»r, but dazed looking. “i on
might ’ave ’ung your forage-cap on his bloomin*
bulgin’ eyes,” remarked Skew.
dagger was marched in front of the Major, and
his crime proved by the troop Orderly-Sergeant,
whom the Major promptly and virulently attacked
for some alleged irregularity in dress. “By God,
sir,” he thundered, “I’ll reduce every lout of a
non-commissioned officer in the regiment. I’ll rig
the triangles, and flog the regiment from right to
left. I’ll- .” Then he cooled suddenly, looked
at the prisoner ? and said, “Dismissed ! ” dagger
saluted, went right face, and swaggered over to his
bungalow, more offensively blatant than ever.
Fee asked him, “Where did you get to yester-
day?” “Nowhere in particular,” replied the
other, frigidly. And this, it was observed, was
the last conversation in which these two ever
indulged.
That night, dagger was again absent. He re-
turned thirty-six hours later, more vacuous-look-
ing, if possible, than before. “ Reprimanded ”
was, to the profound astonishment of the regiment,
the Major’s brief sentence. At night, he was
again missing. This time, he stayed away three
days. Now, such a crime would have insured any
other man cells, at the very least; possibly a regi-
mental court-martial. The Major awarded “ three
days confined to barracks,” and even the subser-
vient little Adjutant nearly choked with indigna-
tion. Certainly the Major’s language to the
prisoner was lurid and scathing. But what is
wrath which evaporates in profanity ?
That same night dagger broke arrest and was
absent. He did not come back for four days.
This time the Major did not storm. He spoke
to the prisoner seriously and quietly, and in his
gentlemanly manner—as was the Major’s way
when really dangerous. He said : “It is evident
to me you do not go away to get drunk. You are
either in the toils of some vile native harlot, or you
are a coward and want to avoid active service.
You will not succeed in that. Whatever you do
you shall go, if I have to tie you to the tail of a
bullock-cart and drag you. Now, what is the
matter with you ?”
The big creature, ordinarily so braggart, burst
out blubbering : “I can’t help it, Major. Wish I
may die, sir, if I want to get out of goin’ on ser-
vice. For God’s sake, Major, sir, lock me up till
the order to march conies. Court-martial me, sir
—anythink !”
“No,” said his commanding officer, reflectively ;
“no, I’ll give you one more chance. I’ll trust to
—to your honor as a soldier. Return to your duty
and behave like a man.”
-Tagger attempted some reply, but sharp and
short came the regimental Sergeant-Major’s—
“Salute! right face! quick march!” The man
slunk over to his troop. Afterwards Major,
Adjutant, and Provost-Sergeant—the latter a gray,
grim, and wily old non-com.—held long conference.
* * *
At midnight, when “A” Troop snored
with unanimity, dagger got slowly up from his
cot, sat awhile on the edge cogitative, and began
to dress. Presently, as if thinking better of it, he
lay down. Ten minutes later he sprang up, his
eyes fixed., his mouth working. Once more he
seemed to conquer an almost irresistible impulse
and fell back with a groan. Half an hour passed.
Then he dressed quickly and resolutely and went
out of the door, through which the moonbeams
gleamed, as if dragged by a rope. Fee at that
moment n.iied himself on his elbow, stared at the
retreating figure, and laughed softly and unplea-
santly. Some two hours after, dagger, handcuffed,
was brought into cantonments by the Provost anti
lodged in the guardroom. Next morning Provost-
Sergeant Clink reported to the Adjutant :
“According to orders, I watched ‘A’ bunga-
low last night with Privates Ball and Curtis. At
12.30 Private dagger came out, dressed, and headed
across the maidan by a disused path to north of
the fort. Followed him upwards of three miles.
Then entered a tape, which I have not seen before.
There were two huts—one at north end, one at
south. He went to the north
jnd hut. We followed, covered
by the trees. At door of hut
stood a native woman, young
and very well-looking, dressed
handsomely in white and with
heavy white flowers in her hair.
Eyes very shining and notice-
able. Not a lot bazar woman,
nor a common woman. Have
never seen her before ; quite re-
spectable. She stood as if
beckoning. .Tagger went into
hut. Woman followed and shut
door. Neither spoke. Private
dagger’s eyes very curious. I
and Privates Ball and Curtis
particularly noticed this. Eyes
very wide open and fixed. There
was faint light burning in hut.
Made small holes in thatch of
low roof and looked in. In hut
two charpoys opposite one an-
other, some brass cooking pots
and two very handsome native
bedcovers ; nothing more. When
woman had shut door she turned
and looked at dagger, who
stood as at attention. She
threw her hands out, knuckles
to the front, dagger fell back
quite stiff on charpoy and lay
there quiet. Woman sat looking
at him. Watched for half-hour.
No difference. Turned dark
lantern on and forced door.
Woman gone ; though we’d all
seen her two seconds before.
Could not arouse dagger for
long time. Got him up at last,
but he would not speak. Hand-
cuffed him, brought him into
barracks and handed him over
to Sergeant Selkirk, in charge of
the guard at 2.30 a.m. Returned
to hut. Woman there light
burning. Woman lay on char-
poy, eyes shut, very handsome
person. Did not breathe ; could
feel no heart beat, body warm,
did not smell of drugs or
liquor. Examined hut thoroughly. No hole big
enough for small snake even. Fastened door,
wound cotton-thread round and round hut from
ground to roof, leaving door free. Watched. At
3.49 a.m. precisely woman was still on charpoy.
At 3.50 Private Curtis called out, ‘She’s going !’
I looked closely and saw only the woman’s head
and shoulders on charpoy. Five seconds after she
had disappeared. Cotton outside hut quite un-
touched and unslacked. Impossible she could
have got out. Entered hut, dug up mud flooring,
which throughout was solid and hard. Waited
until broad daylight. No sign of woman. Re-
turned to barracks. Woman uncommonly beauti-
ful—gypsy appearance. Should know her again
anyvvdiere. ”
Sergeant of the Guard Selkirk reported :
“ Private dagger, * A ’ Troop, was handed over
to my charge by Provost-Sergeant at 2.30 a.m.
Crime absent without leave. He was confined in
♦ “ Jadooine literally, " Uewilohiug.”


cell at back of guardroom. I took handcuffs off.
He never spoke, was perfectly sober and lay down
at once and appeared to sleep. At 3.50 he started
up and made a violent attempt to break door
down. Was so outrageous that I had to handcuff
him, hands behind back. While this was going
on Privates Adams, Reid and Whitlaw declare
that a native woman, dressed in white with white
flowers in her hair and very brilliant eyes, came
and stood and beckoned towards Jagger at the
fuard-room door. As they are all young soldiers
took no notice of the matter.”
* * *
“ Here, read these reports,” said the
Adjutant, who was sweating at his quarterly
returns, early next morning, to the doctor of the
30th, who rode up to the orderly-room for five
minutes’ chat before breakfast.
The doctor, three-parts of whose life had been
passed in India, read. Then he puckered his
mouth into queer shape.
“Did you ever hear of such damned folly?” said
the Adjutant.
“Rawlinson,” remarked the doctor, “you are
an awfully decent little fellow. You know more
about the pipeclaying of a pouch-belt, and —if you
are only given time—can get the regiment into
better line than almost any man of your inches.
But you know rather less, man, of natives and
what they can do than you know of —of the way
to Heaven!”
“ Well, then, how do you account for it ?”
“ I don’t account for it. The woman’s influence
over Jagger may be hypnotism—a word we use
to conceal our sickening ignorance. But how a
woman disappears at will—well —l give it up. ”
“Gh ! thanks, very much,” said little Rawlin-
son.
# * *
What the Major said, when Jagger was
brought in front of him, was, “ Seven days’ cells !”
What the Adjutant said when, next morning,
the Provost-Sergeant reported that Jagger had
broken out of cells—though the lock was ap-
parently untampered with and the sentries had
seen no one pass—and that he (Jagger, or the
remains of him) had been found dead, prone on
his belly, before the hut at the north end of the
type, was, “Well, I’m damned !”

Standing calm, impassive, lonely ;
Ice and snow, where never change is
Save the mighty motion only,
Where through valleys seared and deep
Slow the serpent glaciers creep.
Land of silent lakes that nestle
Deep as night, girt round with forest—

THE BUNDARY RIDER'S STORY
FOR THE BULLETIN
The storm that had been brewing all the hot
afternoon, gathered, towards nightfall, in grim,
black clouds, cleft every now and then by jagged
streaks of vivid lightning. Just after dark it
burst in a fierce rush of rain and boom and rattle
of thunder. Blinding as the lightning was, it was
only by its assistance that a belated traveller
could keep his horse on the bridle-track he was
following ; for when the darkness fell between the
flashes it was as though a black pall h.'.d been
dropped over everything.
With heads bent down the sodden man and
horse plodded on until the rider found himself on
a main road into which the track debouched.
“ Another mile,” he muttered to himself, “ and
I’ll come to old Mao’s. ” He touched the horse
slightly with the spur and glanced nervously
round. The travelling now improved, and ere
long a dim light ahead proclaimed his approach to
some kind of habitation. Soon afterwards he
pulled up at the verandah of a small bush inn.
“Are you in, Mac?” he roared with a voice
which outdid the thunder, as he splashed down
from his horse into a pool of water and hastily
proceeded to ungirth.
“Who’s there?” returned a voice, and the
owner came out and peered into the darkness.
“Smithson ! Lend us a pair of hobbles.”
“ Jupiter ! what are you doing out here such a
night?” asked Mac as he handed the hobbles.
“ ’Cos I’m a fool, that’s why,” said Smithson, as
he stooped down and buckled the straps. “ Can’t
go wrong for feed ?”
“Right up to the back door. Come in and get
a change.”
Hanging his saddle and bridle on a peg driven
into the slab, the late traveller followed his host
into the bar. Mac put his head out of the back-
door, and roared to somebody to bring in some
tea ; then reached down a bottle and placed it,
with a glass, before his visitor. Smithson filled
out a stiff drink, tossed it off neat, and gave a
sigh of satisfaction. Having got a dry shirt and
trousers, the traveller proceeded to simultaneously
enjoy a good meal and his host’s curiosity.
“ It’s that cursed Chinaman hunted me. The
one who cut his throat.”
“Did you see him?” asked Mac in an awed
voice.
“ I did, indeed, with the bandages round his
neck just as they found him. I meant to go in to
the station and tell the boss he must send out
somebody else. Then I remembered that you
were nearer and came over for a bit of company.
Now, don’t laugh at a fellow—just you go and
stop in my hut for a night or two.”
“No fear,” returned Mac emphatically.
“ Well, I thought I didn’t care for anything,”
said the boundary-rider, “ but this caps all. You
should see —oripes! what’s that!” For a long, lugu-
brious howl sounded outside, followed by the rat-
tling of a chain. Both men forced a very artificial
laugh.
“It’s Boxer,” said Smithson, suddenly illumined.
“ I left him tied up, but he’s got his chain loose
and followed me. ”
A very wet and woe-begone dog came in at his
call. Smithson detached the chain from his collar,
and they sat down again.
“ Boxer didn’t fancy being left alone,’’remarked
Mac.
“ Seems not. It gave me quite a turn when he
howled like that. What do you say ?” Taking
the hint, Mac arose and the two went into the
bar.
“ All alone to-night ?” asked Smithson.
“Yes, the missus is in town ; there’s only deaf
Ben in the kitchen. ”
“ Well, I hope that d d Chinaman won’t
follow the, dog. ”
“Don’t get talking like that. How did he come
to out his throat ? ft was before my time. ”
“ The fellow who had the contract for the pad-
dock-fence lived in the hut with two men, and the
Chinaman was cooking for them ; he was there for
over six months. Chris., the contractor, he paid
off the other men; and he and the Chinaman
stopped for a week longer to finish up some odd
jobs. One morning Chris, came in to the station
as hard as he could split—the Chow had cut his
throat the night before. Chris, said he wasn’t
quite dead, and that he had tied up the wound as
well as he could. The super, and another man
went back with him, but when they arrived the
Chinkie was as dead as a door-nail. Now, the
strange thing was that the stuff Chris, had tied round
his throat was quite clean ; but when they moved
the body, with Chris, holding the shoulders, the
blood commenced to soak through, and turned
them all quite faint. All Chris, knew about it
was that when he awoke in the morning the
Chinaman was lying outside with a sheath-knife
in his hand and his throat cut. ”
“ And did you see nothing until to-night ?”
“ No. Just after dark I heard someone calling,
and I went to the door and looked out. I can tell
you I just did get a fright, for there by the
lightning I saw the Chinaman standing, with
bloody rags round his neck, and the knife in his
hand.”
Mac shuddered and passed the bottle.
“Now,” said Smithson, “comes the strange part
of it. That shout, or coo-ee, I heard, came from
some way off, and that there ghost I saw was not
looking at me, but listening for that shout, and
smiling like a man who was expecting a friend
coming.
“ What did you do ?”
“ I slammed the door to, picked up my saddle
and bridle and got out of the back window. I
knew my old moke was not far off, but I was that
soared I left his hobbles where I took them off. I
heard Boxer howling as I rode away.”
* * *
It was. a beautiful morning after the storm as
Smithson rode in to the head station. So bright
and cheerful was it that the boundary-rider felt
rathef ashamed of the yarn he was going to tell
and half-inclined to turn back. However, he went
on and had an interview with the superintendent.
Naturally he was laughed at, and this, of course,
made him stubborn.
“ I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” said Morrison, the
super., at last. “I’ll go back with you this
afternoon and stop the night with you, and we’ll
see if we can’t quiet the Chinaman. ”
Smithson agreed, remarking that perhaps it was
only on one particular night he walked, as he
had never seen him before.
Morrison turned up an old diary and glanced
through it. “ Oh, that’s nothing,” he said, push-
ing it away.
* * *
The two men rode up to the lonely hut, Morri-
son slightly ahead. “There’s something queer
there,” he said, pulling up. Smithson stared
eagerly; while Boxer, who was with them, sat
down on the road and howled dismally.
Recovering themselves, the two rode on. A man
was lying in front of the door stretched out in
death. Dismounting, they approached and ex-
amined him.
“ No, no !” cried Smithson, “don’t touch him
we mustn’t till the police come.”
With an impatient gesture Morrison stooped
down and turned the dead face up. In the throat
was a rude wound, and in the open eyes a terror
more than human.
“It’s Christy,” said the superintendent in a
quiet voice.
“The man who employed the Chinaman ?” asked
Smithson in an unsteady tone.
“Yes. How, in the name of God, did he come
here ? Tell me exactly what you saw and heard. ”
“ I was in the doorway, as I told you,” said the
boundary-rider excitedly, “standing just there,
and by the flash of lightning I saw the Chinaman
here ” —and he indicated the spot. “He was
standing like this ” —and he bent forward like a
man watching and listening—-“looking in the
direction the cry came from over there.”
“ And you saw a knife in his hand ?”
“Yes, and he was smiling as though expecting
somebody he wanted to see badly.”
Morrison put his hand on the other’s shoulder
and pointed to the knife in the hand of the corpse.
“ Was it that knife ?”
“ It looks like it,” chattered Smithson.
The superintendent glanced about and shook
his head. “No tracks to tell tales,” he said.
“No, all the storm was on afterwards.”
Morrison mused a bit. “ Get a sheet of bark,”
he said, “or one of those sheets of iron there.
We must put him inside, and then I’ll give you a
letter to take in to the police. You can get back
with the sergeant by to-morrow morning, and
we’ll bury him.”
“ You’re not going to stop here?’’said Smith-
son.
“ No,” returned Morrison. “I’ll get over to
Mac’s.
They lifted the dead man on to the sheet of iron
and carried him into his old dwelling - place,
Smithson evidently much averse to the job. Mor-
rison tried to close the staring eyes before they put
one of Smithßon’B blankets over the corpse ; but
the lids were rigid. “Evidently he didn’t like
the look of where he’s gone to,” he muttered. The
two set out—one to the little township, the other
to Mac’s pub. .
The night was as calm and fine as though ram aii 1 1
lightning and thunder were unknown. Morrison
mused deeply over the tragic occurrence, trying to
recall all he knew of the past and put a common-
sense construction on it, but he failed and only
made himself nervous.
“ There’s one very strange thing about the
affair,” he said to Mac, when they were discussing
it that evening. “When I paid Chris, for the
contract —over which he lost, by the way —I gave
him separate cheques to pay off his men, including
one for the Chinaman of about .£3O. That cheque
was not found, and, moreover, it has never been
presented to this day,”
“ What sort of feUow was Chris. ?”
“ A good fencer, but a stupid fellow, not fit to
take contracts. I often wonder if he took the
cheque off the body before he came in.”
“ Then why didn’t he present it ? ”
‘ ‘ That was his idea, no doubt, at first. But I
tell you he could scarcely read or write, and 1
suppose after he heard me tell the sergeant that
I would give the bank notice and instruct them to
watch for the cheque, he got frightened.”
“ Before that he imagined that one cheque was
the same as another, and that you could not trace
a particular one?”
“Yes, just about what he would think.”
“ Perhaps he killed the Chinaman ?”
‘ ‘ Perhaps he did, ” returned Morrison, after a
long and thoughtful pause.
By sunrise Morrison and Mao were at the
boundary-rider’s hut, and soon afterwards the
sergeant and Smithson arrived. The examination
did not take long, and they prepared to dig a
grave.
“ Better not bury him alongside the other,” said
the sergeant.
“ No,” replied Morrison. “Let’s see, we buried
him over at that tree ; didn’t we, sergeant ?”
“Yes, and not very deep either. It was dry
weather ; the ground was hard ; and we came upon
a big root. ”
The obsequies were not prolonged. Sewn up in
the blanket, the dead man was soon laid in a damp
grave. While the others were filling it up, Morri-
son, still thinking of Mac’s remark, strolled over
to the spot where the Chinaman slept, not expect-
ing to see any mark of the place left. He started
and turned pale.
“ Here ! quick ! Come here !” he cried. _
The men came hastily, the tools still in then-
hands. The earth over the old grave had been
loosened and disturbed.
“ My God ! he’s got up !” murmured Smithson.
“I’ve heard they can’t rest out of their own
country.”
“Give me a shovel,” cried Morrison ; and com-
menced to carefully scrape the earth away. The
sergeant assisted him, and they soon came to the
skeleton, for nearly everything but the bones was
gone.
“ What do you expect to find ?” asked the
sergeant.
Morrison was carefully brushing the loose dirt
off the thing with a bough.
“Look here !” he said.
Clasped in the fleshless hand was the missing
cheque.
“It wasn’t buried with him, I’ll swear,” said
the sergeant.
“And if it had been, it would have decayed
long since, ” answered Morrison.
“ He got up and took it from Chris, last night.
He was bound to get his cheque back,” said Mac.
“ Well, I’m going to pack up my traps,” re-
marked Smithson.
“I’ll send down and have this hut shifted,”
said Morrison. “Although, now he’s got what
he wanted, I don’t suppose he’ll get up again. ”
“ By gum, I won’t trust him,” said the boundary-
rider.
DELCOMYN.
There lives in a certain Australian town
a small and perky solicitor who had an ex-
perience once. Most solicitors have had an
experience once, but this one’s experience was
worse than the average. It was his duty,
in the interests of a client, to issue a writ
against a very large, freckled Irish person,
and the latter came in to ask for an explanation.
He was grieved, but calm, and carried the docu-
ment in his “ fisht.” In the other fisht he had a
stick. The small solicitor was alone ; he was sit.
ting at a table at the further end of the room, and
the Irish person was between him and the door.
When the visitor had scowled several times he
drove his hat firmly on his head, and the subse-
quent proceedings consisted of a monologue in a
powerful bog accent. “Sorr,” said the intruder
hitting the table persuasively with his cudgel,
“ye sint me this paper. Oi’ve just called to ask
what ye mane by it. If you can’t tell me what ye
mane by it, it’ll be the worse for yez. Spake now,
c. \’t yez ? ” The stick came down with a fearful
weit on the table. “If ye don’t spake Oi’ll
put yer skull through the window. Don’t preshume
to addriss me now. If ye dare to say a word to
me Oi’ll rub yer ear on the flure. ” The solicitor’s
knees smote together and he maintained a dead
silence, while his visitor hit the table in a fresh
place and resumed. “ Can’t ye spake ? Don’t
attimpt to bully me now ! Don’t use threatenin’
language to me or it’ll be the worse for yez ! Don’t
look at me with that overbearin’ expression ! If
ye think yer goin’ to frighten me ye’re very much
mi staken. Don’t attimpt usin’ bloodthirsty threats
to me, now, or O’ll brain ye with the chair. Oi just
kem in here to ask ye, calmly and quietly, what ye
mane by sendin’ that dirthy bit of paper to me,
an’ ye use violent language an’ trate me wid soilent
contimpt. O’ll begin to get angry soon. If ye
spake I’ll throw ye down the stair ! What did ye
do it for? What d’ye mane by it? Will ye-SPAKE?
Now don’t ye thretten me wid the law ! If ye dare
to say a wor-r-rd now —just one wor-r-rd
I’ll break the table wid yer head.” The
small solicitor sat with his mouth open and glared
at his visitor with a petrified expression, while
the Irish gentleman dented the table again with
his stick and grew purple with excitement, but
made a great effort to be calm. “Look here,
now,” he said, in a large, hot, moist whisper, right
into the miserable attorney’s ear, “Oi won’t
shtand much more of this. Oi kem here an’ asked
ye a civil question, an’ ye look at me with a mur-
derous expression, an’ ye won’t say anythin’, an
ye try to bully me. Are yez goin’ to explain Gl-
are ye not ? If ye say a wor-r-rd now Oi’ll flatten
yer head, so I will. If I hear ye flunkin’ in a
disrespectful tone Oi’ll tear yer ear off ! Oi’ll ”
but just here the diminutive lawyer made a
strategic movement for the door, and rushing past
the enemy did one long, comprehensive slide
down the bannisters, and arrived hatless in the
street. He has never served a writ on any but
the smallest kind of Irishman since.


BLACK
PETER'S
LAST
KISS
FOR THE
BULLETIN
It was the year 1840, and the hitter desola-
tion of a winter severe even for Tasmania lay
heavily upon all life at the Great Lake. Day
after day a watery sun glimmered fitfully along
the northern horizon, through storms of sleet and
snow that buried the few shepherds’ huts on the
deserted runs, and whitened the jagged “ Tiers ”
until they shone like icebergs. Lost in the clouds,
4000 feet above the sea, that lonely plateau seemed
given over to the powers of darkness; and Nature,
in all her aspects, grew loveless and terrible.
For, when the Polar tempest no longer lashed the
sullen surface of the lake, a deathly film of ice,
rapidly looping from headland to headland, blotted
out the bays and inlets, leaving only the far-off
surface of the central waters still gleaming,
trembling—and waiting.
To the solitary shepherd, doomed to winter in
those regions, what followed was even more awful
than that frozen silence. When the southern
winds swooped once again upon the prisoned lake,
great fissures and cracks tore and split shoreward
through the plains of ice with a sharp, incessant
crackling as of closest thunder. Daily thereafter
the angry waters drove the shattered ice upon the
northern coast, until Macarthur’s shepherd and
his wife, in their lonely hut by the shore, heard
once again the splash of the open waves, and the
crash of the piled-up hummocks grinding along
the shingly shore.
♦ * *
Macarthur’s shepherd was an elderly man,
like any other, but his wife was one in a thousand
—by the mercy of God. The chill twilight was
failing outside as they crouched together over a
roaring fire, and the woman cautiously unfolded
her plan.
“ Bill,” she said in her soft, drawling voice, “ I
found a hundred pounds yesterday.”
The old man looked at her curiously—they so
seldom spoke. “ Seein’s believin’, Bess.”
“ I tell you I’ve found a hundred sovereigns;
think of it, Bill—two years’ pay ! ”
A quick look of suspicion darkened his face, but
a moment later : “No ! no ! yer don’t find no
hundred pounds—leastways not in these parts
among poor young shepherds, and, anyhow, you
ain’t what you once was to look at.” He spat in
the fire and laughed coarsely.
She was strangely excited, for she allowed even
the insult to her appearance to pass unnoticed.
“ Bill,” she went on, half standing up as she
bent towards him, her forefinger trembling in his
face: “If you’ll only be a man to-night the
money’s yours—ours, I mean—we go whacks.”
“ Give over yer foolin’, girl, and say what you
mean. ”
“ Bill! Don’t you remember the notice on the
p’lice-station : ‘ A hundred pounds, dead or
alive?”’
The shepherd shrank from the strange force of
the woman as she stooped still closer and
whispered: “ I saw Black Peter on the marsh
yesterday—spoke to him—he’s coming to-night.”
The man started to his feet, his face white with
terror, and made a quick movement towards the
corner of the hut. She caught him by the arm :
“You know Black P« fr r's too cunning for that—
he’d have the first shoo
here like he’s always
had with the p’liee—
it’ll take the two of us
to do him.”
“My God ! And
lie knows I let on
about his camp in the
Cressy—Bess, we m ust
clear. ”
The woman let go
his arm and sat down
again on her box.
“Go if you like,” she
said slowly, looking
fixedly into the fire ;
“I’ll wait for Black
Peter: me and him
was old friends once
—he wouldn’t shoot
me. ”
She was playing him
like a fish. That senile
jealousy of his must be
made to take the place
of failing courage.
‘ ‘ He’s the damnedest
scoundrel unhu n g, ’
juavered the shep-
herd fiercely, and as
for you !”
“ Sit down and stop
shiverin’. Now! I
told him you was off
this morning to the
steppes for flour, so
lie’s coinin’ to-night
J>
“What the devil’s
V cornin’ for ?” Again
the suspicious look.
“What’s that to
you?” She was still looking dreamily into the
fire, all her face aglow with the heat.
“Bess, we’ll ’ave that ’undred iiounds.” She
1 1 id landed him all right: he would “he a man ”
now. Their heads drew closer together as they
laid their plan.
Soon the man rose, took a small axe in his hand,
and shouldering open the door against the drifted
snow, left the woman alone in the warmth and
light of the log hut.
I said that she was “one woman in a
thousand ” —by the mercy of God, But that
“ one woman ” alas ! may be found in a thousand
places at once, for what man has not seen her—
looked upon her, never to forget—madly fluttered
a moment in the white light of her fierce desire, to
lie long after in the living death of shrivelled
wings and blinded sight! What need to describe
bur V To see her we need only recollect.
# * *
She moved to the window, and, lifting the
sack that served for a blind, looked out upon the
night. The storm had spent its force ; the western
sky was clear ; and the young moon already hung
low above the Tiers : in half-an-hour Black Peter
would come. She drew a large gold brooch from
her pocket, and with it fastened the open neck of
her rough dress. Then, as though mentally
rehearsing a part she was about to play, she passed
through the doorless opening that led to the inner
room; lay back a moment upon the rug-covered
couch in a position to see the outside door ; went
to the door and examined the latch ; and, finally,
taking a broken mirror from a little table by the
bed, advanced into the full light of the larger
room and let down her hair.
The Medusa with her living locks and baleful
eyes was never a myth. To-day, as of old, she
turns the strong heart to stone, and the angels
themselves still fail before her. She was merely
“ one woman in a thousand”—by the mercy of
God ; just such another, indeed, as Bess, whose
burning hair also was alive, curling down
and slowly unfolding in lazy, reluctant masses
oyer her breast and shoulders, every thread
tingling with an electric vitality and volition of
its own. Her large-limbed, voluptuous figure and
fair, sensual face seemed kindled with a fierce
freedom and daemonic power, as that wild bridal-
veil of Nature trailed its long splendour to her
knees.
* * *
The latch rattled ; the door shook on its
hinges ; and a moment later a huge man stumbled
into the light, scattering a shower of snow from
his feet.
“ I’ve come, Bess,” he said, blinking awkwardly
in the light; but when he saw her “ crown of
glory ” his dark face flushed with pleasure, and he
advanced with hands outstretched.
“ My God ! it’s like old times—and you’ve put
the brooch on for me, too —just like you.” He
kissed her lips, his great enfolding arms lost in the
wonder of her hair.
“ Wasn’t you afraid to come so careless-like
without the signal—and where’s your gun ? ” She
lay back in his arms looking up at him with veiled
triumph.
“My God! if I couldn’t trust you!” All at
once the gathering clouds of his wild life seemed
to darken and chill his heart. “The game’s up,
Bess,” he said, letting her go, and half-sitting on
the table. “ The p’lice are all through the Lake
country, and I must clear : what shall we do ? ”
“ Be happy to-night, ” she answered gently, as
she wiped his wet forehead with her hand, and
drew his face to hers.
“ There ! now take off your boots and warm
your feet while I make up the fire for the night. ”
“ Here ! let me ”
“Do as I bid you ! ” —and while the man
stooped oyer his laces the woman threw three
great logs into the glowing embers. Three times
a golden shower of charcoal sparks shot through
the chimney into the frozen night. Then she took
off her brooch, and her full white neck lay bare as,
with both hands, she threw back her hair from her
shoulders, and laughingly held out her arms to him.
The man put his boots by the fire that now
roared up the chimney, filling the room with
rippling light ; and took the woman in his arms.
“Them long golden curlin’ flames with the
dancin’, shinin’ sparks at the ends of ’em always
aminds me of your hair, Bess. When I’m game
to have a fire out camping it always makes me
think of ”
A strange report suddenly rang through the
night air. Black Peter sprang to the door.
“ What is it, Bess ?”
“ You great baby,” she laughed, “if you’d
camped like I have all this winter, by the Lake,
you d know the sound of a big tree splittin’; when
the sap gets froze in their heart they bust. The
heavy timber along the Lake has been going that
way for weeks. Come 1”
“ I was a fool—but it frightened me,” he said,
as they moved together to the inner room.
Bess seated herself, leaning back upon the great
pile of rugs. Black Peter bent his hot face upon
her neck, while over his bowed shoulders she
watched the latch of the outer door.
“ You really love me, Bess?”—and even as m
whispered the latch rose.
“ Love you ?” She had seen it.
“ She threw bach her hair from her
shoulders, and laughingly held out her
arms to him. ”
“ Yes—like I love you ?”
The door opened with a slight grating sound,
and the old man, dazzled by the fierce light, stood
a moment on the threshold, axe in hand. Black
Peter lifted his head as though listening.
“Love you, Pete, darling—of course, I do—like
this!” Her lithe arms twined about him, and
he sank in her fast embrace.
The old man took a cautious step towards them,
but again Black Peter heard the sound, and, look -
ing suddenly into the woman’s eyes, saw their
cruel menace and knew he was betrayed. One
mad struggle, a closer tightening of the soft arms,
a ghastly vision of flaming red serpents writhing
and hissing about his face, and all was over. Yet
the ending was strange.
“Bess, Bess, the sap in my heart’s froze—give
me !”
He stopped struggling as he spoke—indeed,
when the blow fell his arms were holding her to
him, and his lips were pressed upon her forehead.
* * #
In the early spring, when the young sheep
came up from the plains, and the Great Lake
rested from its labors, asleep under cloudless skies,
old Bill got the blood-money, but he never went
whacks after all.
Bess cleared with the lot, and a young shepherd
thrown in.
MATHINNA.
THE OTHEP MRS BREWEP
FOR THE BULLETIN
Brewer convulsed society, such as it was, on the
Upper Bass River, by bringing a young and pretty
wife with him when he returned to the station
after a prolonged visit to Melbourne. It was not
thought fair that he should thus take everyone un-
prepared, for society on the Bass was, in those
days, exclusively male and in a very primitive
state. However, his neighbours accepted the
situation with the best possible grace, and blue-
eyed Mrs. Brewer, plunging into bush-life with all
the ardour of a young bride, was generally voted a
jolly little woman.
Unfortunately, she was young and comparatively
innocent of the ways of the wicked world, and
there was no discreet matron to “ let her down
easily.” Which brought trouble on Brewer,
although it was mainly his own fault for holding
himself up to his admiring wife as a man superior
to the common failings of humanity.
It was one of those beautifully clear mornings
which usually follow a heavy thunderstorm.
Brewer, now two months married, was in a most
contented frame of mind. The thunderstorm had
come just when needed, and had fallen so exact! v
where it would
do most good
that Brewer, as
he stood in the
Clear out to camp! you bin saucy fellow alonga Missy Brewer! ”
verandah and watched the black-boy bring up
the paddock horses, felt that Providence must
have had an especial eye for his interests.
Little Mrs. Brewer was in the kitchen prepar-
mg breakfast, and, as her husband turned to
enter the living-room, he was astonished to see
her hasten into the house with a very perturbed
countenance and rush into her bedroom. Brewer
lollowed, full of anxiety. Mrs. Brewer had
thrown herself face-downwards on the bed and
was sobbing as though her heart was broken,
Deeply distressed and alarmed, Brewer flew to her
side, and, while attempting to raise her, begged
earnestly to know the cause of her trouble. It
was only atfer half-an-hour’s petting, when the big,
convulsive sobs had grown somewhat less, that she
consented to turn her wet face round and gasp out:
1 here s a wo-wo-man in the kit-kitchen who
says she’s Mrs. Brew-Brew-Brewer! ”
vvhat! cried Brewer, 1 ‘ what can you mean ?
What is she like ? ”
“Oh! do-do-don’t ask me. She’s a b-br-
brunette, and 1 heard you say once you li-li-liked
u..rk women. O ! I want to die ! ’’—and with a
fresh burst of weeping she again cast herself
down -
Brewer was aghast. However, plainly the only
thing to do was to go and investigate, so he
hurried to the kitchen. A comely, buxom black
gin, attired in the nsual costume of a short skirt,
was squatting by the hre. She looked over her
shcnilder and grinned pleasantly at Brewer
“Hang you, Betty!” he cried, “what for you
come here ? Mine bin tell it blackfellow no more
walk about alonga station.”
“Yowi,” she returned, “me want baccy, me
want see-em white Mary.”
“i’ll baccy you,” screamed Brewer, talking
nonsense in his wrath. “ Clear out to camp ! you
bin saucy fellow alonga Missy Brewer !”
The gin arose, sulkily. “Bal mine bin saucy
fellow ; only yabba name belonging me. Missy
Brur alsame sit down alonga white Mary.”
. “ The devil you did !” said Brewer, and, snatch-
ing a stockwhip from a nail on the slabs, he
threatened his visitor, who retired slowly and
scornfully. 1 hen Brewer went back to his weep-
in r wife.
“Why, Rosie, you silly little woman! it’s only
one of the blacks from the camp. When they
first came in, years ago, we nicknamed them all,
and it was some stupid joke of one of the fellows
to call this woman ‘Mrs. Brewer.’ Why, there’s
Mr. Gladstone, and Sam Griffith, and Lady
Loftus, and all names like that amongst them ;
and very proud of them they are. ”
By this time Brewer had got her on to his knee,
but she still persistently hung her head over his
shoulder and moaned : “Send me home to mother,
Harry. lam sure I shall—booh—die soon.”
Gradually the storm was spent, like the thunder-
storm of the night before, and, at last, she con-
sented to wash her face and come to breakfast.
But although a newly-married man like Brewer
flattered himself that it was all over, anyone more
experienced in the ways of women would have
seen at a glance that Mrs. Brewer accepted her
husband’s lame explanation with much salt, and
intended pursuing private investigations on her
own account.
After breakfast Brewer went out on the run,
and his wife, having finished her domestic duties,
started out with Buck, the blackboy, who was to
conduct her to the blacks’camp a Couple of miles
away. Poor little Mrs. Brewer, brought up in a
country part of Victoria, had never seen any b, t
the ‘ ‘ civilised ” blacks of that province. Brewer
had banished all the aborigines from about the
station.
They came upon the camp suddenly and un-
expectedly, and there she saw, for the first time,
the noble savage on his native heath, One horri-
fied glance was enough—-to Buck’s astonishment
she turned her horse’s head and fled back to the
homestead. Before reaching the slip-rails she re-
covered herself and allowed Buck to catch her, as
she had a few questions to ask. First, what was
the name of the gin who had come up to the
kitchen in the morning? “ Betty.” Secondly,
•were any of the blacks called “ Mr. Gladstone,” or
“ Sam Griffith ” ? Buck shook his head hopelessly
—he had never heard of such names.
Mrs. Brewer bit her lip and rode straight home.
Brewer returned lifting a song—for was not “con-
fidence ” once more restored ?
Mrs. Brewer met him in her new character of
iceberg. He interviewed Buck and found out
about the visit to the camp; having given poor
Buck a sound hiding to relieve his feelings, he
went in and lectured Mrs. Brewer on the
impropriety of her conduct until she burst into
tears and locked herself in her bedroom. Brewer
felt better after that ; he had asserted himself.
He passed a miserable evening. Mrs. Brewer
refused either to see or to speak to him, although
he yelled through the keyhole that he was
going down to the men’s hut to play euchre
all night, which was the direst threat he could
think of. He did not go there, however —he just
got some rum out of the store and went to sleep
in a verandah until he awoke with the sun in the
morning, covered with mosquito-bites, but radiant
with an idea, a perfect inspiration. After a swim
down in the river he returned in the sunniest of
tempers. Mrs. Brewer came to breakfast without
an appetite, and with a martyr’s fa'-". ”
‘ ‘I have been

sad Brewer,

Betty was a talkative gin with a great gift of
blacks patter, and, flattered by the preference
shown hor, she rattled on with scores of anecdotes
about all the whites in the district which, fortu-
nateJy Mrs. Brewer did not half understand..
Artfully, as she thought, she questioned Betty
about herself. Had she a picaninny ? O yes
Betty had a budgeree boy. Would she bring it
up for Mrs Brewer to see ? Betty brought the
budgeree boy up that afternoon, and, with a
jealous scrutiny, Mrs. Brower eagerly inspected
He was two years old, and the blackest, ugliest
young combo ever seen. The most suspicious,
individual could not have traced any white blood
in him.
“And who’s your husbind, Betty?” inquired
the now-smiling Mrs. Brewer.
Betty stared without answering.
‘Picaninny, father?” explanatorily continued
the repentant Rosie, pointing to the child, which
had, of course, been borrowed from the camp for
the occasion.
“ Mine bin lose-em,” muttered Betty, who had!

I should not care if, in one long embrace,
My lips might have their wish upon your face ;
My head lie on your breast, your lovelit eyes,
Dark as deep waters, be mine only skies :
If, while my love and life lay in your hands,
Whose lightest clasp is strong as iron bands,
You slew me with your musky-scented hair,
I should not care !
For after too much sweet there comes the cloy.
And languor follows close on too much joy,
So while the sweet is sweet —the fair is fair—
Twine round my throat one tress of your bright
hair,
And draw it close until each trembling breath
Droops in the silent slumber men call Death !
Love ! while your lips are sweet—your face is
fair—
Ah, slay me there !

The story of a
Long Watch
FOR THE BULLETIN
I.
Ft was a matter of much wonder why Mrs. Pren-
dergast should have settled down to live in so
sleepy a little township as Nanarjin. True, it
was a seaport, visited once a week by a coastal
steamer, and once a month by an ocean-liner, but
for all that there was no life in the place. Trade
passed on to other centres, and the small popula-
tion simply vegetated. Nevertheless, social
jealousy and feminine curiosity were as rife in
Nanarjin as in London or Paris,
Why had Mrs. Prendergast come to Nanarjin ?
Mrs. Prendergast was a widow, young and
good-looking. It need hardly be said that, with
regard to the male sex, a young and interesting
widow can give any single girl 50 points out of a
hundred and a bad beating; hence the girls’
objection to her unexplained presence in their
midst. So far as it went, however, Mrs. Prender-
gast’s explanation was simple enough. The
climate of Nanarjin agreed with her ; she was
anxious to live quietly, and, as her income was
not large, the place suited her. She had an old
retainer with her, half-servant, half companion ;
not a breath of scandal could be raised against
her; but, for all that, the universal opinion amongst
Nanarjin femininity was, that Mrs. Prendergast
was too good-looking, too well-dressed, and “ too
nice altogether, my dear,” to have come to live in
such an out-of-the-way region without a reason.
Masculine Nanarjin did not share this opinion,
and was quite willing to unquestioningly accept
the widow.
In truth, there was no doubt about it. Those
who had friends in the metropolis had at once
written for information, and the answers were
perfectly definite. Prendergast, of the firm of
Prendergast and Silcott, stock and station agents,
had departed this life in an absolutely conven-
tional and proper manner. He was twenty years
older than his wife, arid had not left her as well
off as had been expected. That was all. Still,
“ why had she come here ?”
That there must be “something behind”
remained the unanimous opinion of the women.
But months passed, and still their curiosity was
unappeased. Beyond doffing her mourning at the
conventional time, the widow did nothing worthy
of comment or notice.
Nearly two hundred miles from Nanarjin, on a
patch of good country, surrounded by unavailable
land, was Binjoomba, a small cattle-station. It.
was far off the main road, seldom visited by any-
one who had not business there, and the owner led
the life of a recluse, save for a periodical spree
m Nanarjin every 12 months. Why he selected
Nanarjin for his annual outburst it would be hard
to say, seeing that there was a far larger and
livelier town within the same distance. But it
had become a matter of habit with him to paint
Nanarjin red once a year, so he continued to do
so, and, as he paid ready-money for everything,
nobody ever objected.
His name was Yates, and, for 11 months in the
year, he was a rather reticent, somewhat abrupt-
mannered gentleman, given to much reading.
For one month, he was the exact opposite, and he
was the exact opposite when he first caught sight
of Mrs. Prendergast from the verandah of the
Royal Hotel, where he was entertaining some of
his numerous friends with the then popular drink
.of dark brandy. Yates seemed suddenly struck
.dumb until the widow had passed, then he arose,
unceremoniously left his friends, went up to his
bedroom and gave instructions that the doctor was
rto be sent for. The doctor came, and after a long
Interview with his patient, in his turn gave orders
that Mr. Yates was not to be disturbed for 24
’.hours.
There was much pei-plexity and also disappoint-
ment amongst a certain section at the cutting
:short of what promised to be a cheap and glorious
spree ; but to repine was useless. Yates kept his
room for three days, and when he descended he
was the sober and proper Yates.
The afternoon of that day found him knocking
at the door of the cottage where lived Mrs.
Prendergast. He was shown into the modest
sitting-room, and presently the widow appeared.
There was not a word of greeting interchanged
between them, and, after a short silence, Yates
made the abrupt remark: “So you married old
Prendergast.”
“Yes,” she repeated, “ I married old Prender-
gast.”
“ Is he up here ?”
“No.”
“In Sydney?”
“ Yes.” There was the suspicion of a smile on
the woman’s face as she replied, but Yates was
looking down and did not see it.
“Is it impertinent of me to ask why you are
residing up here ?”
“ The climate suits me.”
Yates arose and prepared to take his leave
almost as unceremoniously as he had parted from
his boon companions. There was a quick look of
anxiety on Mrs. Prendergast’s face as if she would
detain him, but it passed, and they parted for-
mally and coolly. Yates returned to the hotel,
ordered his horses, and packed his valise. Mrs.
Prendergast shed a few tears and then sat down
and wrote a letter which seemed difficult to com-
pose. Finishing it at last, she sent it by her old
Servant to the Royal ; but when the woman
reached there, Yates was five miles on his road, so
it came back unanswered.
By that time, however, every local woman with
a tongue had related to any other woman who
would listen, the astounding story of how that
dreadful man Yates, of Binjoomba, who avowedly
hated the sight of a petticoat, had called on Mrs.
Prendergast and immediately afterwards left the
township.
11.
A small goldfield had broken out within easy
distance of Binjoomba ; a speculative butcher had
invested in all the fat cattle Yates could muster,
ami he was then on his way to deliver them. It
was the second night out ; the cattle were tired
and wore camped on a soft, comfortable sand-
ridge. Yates, who felt disinclined for sleep, was
keeping watch.
The night was moonless but clear, warm but not
sultry—the sort of night when sleeping in the
open air is a luxury. Yates lit his pipe and
thought of his lost sweetheart. With his customary
reticence, he had not interchanged half-a-dozen
words with anybody in Nanarjin while he was
sober, and when he was drunk all he usually said
was : “ What will you have to drink ? ” He was,
therefore, quite unaware that Mrs. Prendergast
was a widow, for she had relinquished her weeds
some time before he saw her. The hours of dark-
ness wore on. One after another the bright con-
stellations so familiar to bushmen passed over-
head and sloped westward, but Yates still kept a
tireless watch and reasoned out a scheme born in a
brain moody with a long-time solitary life. This
was nothing less than killing a dead man. He
had made up his mind to put Prendergast out of
the way. The idea had grown upon him
irresistibly—fascinated him. He thought of the
silly quarrel which parted him from his love in the
long ago; of the wasted years spent by one in
self-exile, by the other in a joyless wedlock. Now
they had met once more, and the one obstacle was
Prendergast. When the cold grey light of dawn
piled the stars lying low on the horizon,
and Yates called the men who had, much
“So yon married old, Prendergasf.”
to their own satisfaction, been snugly coiled
in their blankets all night, he had fully convinced
himself that the removal of Prendergast was
simply a matter of distasteful but stern necessity.
He had not reasoned out any details ; he' had
simply determined to go to Sydney and then hit
on some plan to carry out his fell purpose.
Yates was a man of action when once aroused.
The cattle delivered, he returned to Binjoomba,
and soon afterwards left for Sydney, via the sea-
port lying north of Nanarjin.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Prendergast remained in a
state of perplexity. The abrupt departure of her
old flame had aroused her pride and prevented her
from forwarding her letter after him to the
station. She began to get tired of Nanarjin and
the petty interests of the place, and decided to
leave it—for a time, at any rate.
Arrived in Sydney, Yates, as soon as possible,
went round to the office of Prendergast and
Silcott. The old name of the Arm had been
retained, after a not uncommon custom, so that
he still remained in his error. For three days he
resolutely kept watch, but no sign of the man he
wanted was visible ; then he entered the office
and asked for his intended victim. In due course
a young fellow of some three or four-and-twenty
came to see him. Yates had to explain that it
was an elder Mr. Prendergast he was anxious to
interview.
“lam afraid you will be disappointed,” com-
menced the young man. “ Mr. Prendergast is— ”
“Out of town ?” interrupted Yates, in his usual
abrupt fashion.
“ Well, yes,” the other was commencing.
Yates waited to hear no more, but, with a gruff
“Good morning,” departed.
He had suddenly come to the conclusion that he
had made a mistake : it must be this young Pren-
dergast, some relation of the old man, to whom
she was married. If so, in all probability he
would not gain much by putting him out of the
way. To rid a woman of an old husband was one
thing, but to part her from a young one, of whom
she was probably fond, was quite another pair of
sleeves. He reluctantly relinquished the murder
notion, but, having still a lurking doubt as to
whether it might not be the old man after all to
whom she was wed, he determined to make the
acquaintance of yonng Prendergast and find out
all about it. This was not hard to manage simply
as a matter of business, and Yates made himself
so agreeable that they soon became familiar
enough for him to mention the fact that he had
lately had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Prendergast
up North.
Now, the young fellow was married, and his
wife had been on a visit to the North, so matters
at once grew still more complicated ; and when
Yates, in as indifferent a tone as he could com-
mand, stated that he and Mrs. Prendergast were
very old friends indeed, his new acquaintance
naturally asked him out to dinner.
When Prendergast, junior, went home, he
jokingly told his wife that he had met an old
sweetheart of hers, who was coming out to
dinner the next day. It so happened that when
Mrs. Prendergast, junior, was away on her visit
she had met an old sweetheart of hers, but of this
she had naturally said nothing to her husband.
Therefore, she first grew very red, then very
angry, and made some derogatory remarks about
men in general which her husband appropriated to
himself, and a small tiff ensued.
111.
Yates went out to dinner full of a lofty spirit of
magnanimity. He would see her once more, make
sure that she was happy, and then bury himself
again for good in the solitude of Binjoomba. He
stood in the drawing-room of his host, gazing
sulkily out of the window, nerving himself for the
coming ordeal, when there was a light tread
behind him and a woman’s voice said in petulant
accents: “What did you mean by telling Dick
that you were an old sweetheart of mine, you
goose? ”
Yates turned in amazement, and the lady, a
perfect stranger to him, started back with a little
cry of surprise. Before either had regained coun-
tenance, young Prendergast came in. Noting his
wife’s red cheeks and Yates’ confused manner, the
demon of jealousy at once entered his heart; but,
like the villain of the drama, be dissembled.
“ No need to introduce you two,” he said, with
mock cheerfulness, and then, as there was no time
for explanations, Yates took his hostess in to
dinner, and they sat down, all feeling mighty
uncomfortable.
Mrs. Prendergast could not explain that Yates
was not the man she expected, without relating the
fact of that other meeting concerning which she had
been silent; Yates was utterly confused and afraid
of putting his foot in it whatever he said; and
young Prendergast was considering the safest
method of killing his guest without being found
out.
The dinner dragged wearily. It was summer
time, and the twilight still lingered. Mrs. Pren-
dergast, from where she sat, could see through the
open French window.
“ Here is somebody coming in a cab, with lug-
gage,” she remarked. “Why, Dick, it is—yes!
it’s the dowager, your mother !”
Young Prendergast arose and looked out of the
window. “It is the mater,” he said, and left the
room to meet the visitor.
Yates, too, looked out of the window. He saw
his old sweetheart coming up the garden. He
saw young Prendergast meet and greet her affec-
tionately, and then he rose up with a
hollow groan that made his hostess ex-
claim, “Good gracious! whatever
is the matter !”
“Let me go,” he said, wildly,
“ these complications are too much
for me. How can he be her
son ? Tell me before I lose my
wits ?”
“ Of course Dick is only her
stepson,” she replied, in a
somewhat scared voice, for
she thought he was a lunatic;
“ but we are all so fond of
her that, as a sort of joke,
we call her ‘ mother ’ and
‘ the dowager. ’ ”
“Then she married. . .
he demanded, breathlessly.
“Dick’s father.”
“ And where is he?”
“Dead and buried these
two years.”
“O, bless you!” he cried,
to her intense dismay, seiz-
ing her hand and kissing it
rapturously.
“ Here ! I say !” cried the
indignant voice of her hus-
band, who had just entered ;
but Yates paid no attention
to him, for there stood his
old love, and he rushed up
to her and commenced a
wild explanation, which, how-
ever, seemed satisfactory enough
to the listener; although the be-
wildered Mrs. Prendergast,
junior, kept entreating her husband to send for
the police and have the madman removed.
In due time explanations ensued, although the
elder Mrs. Prendergast strenuously denied that
she went up to Nanarjin in order to accidentally
meet Yates once more.
“ Do you know, old fellow,” said Prendergast,
pushing the whisky over to his new friend as
they smoked a parting cigar, “ that I was seriously
thinking of poisoning your grog to-night ?”
“And,” returned Yates, as he helped himself, “I
came to Sydney with the firm resolve to put an
end to Mrs. Prendergast’s husband.”

’Ow they chaws an’ spits terbakker,
’Ow they does the dirty yakker ;
’Ow they washes decks o’mornin’son the “ boosom

’Ow they damns ’er and they blarsts ’er,
An’ ’er owner an’ ’er master,
With the wind a-makin’ music an’ the bo’sun

No, ’e’d never been a ’prentice, ’ad the cove who

With a gory lumber cargo, an’ a chanet o’ gettm

’E ’ad never sailed, I’m thinkin’ —or ’e’d cuss

With a (sang-win-airey) Scotchman round the

With a slop-made suit o’ close on
An’ ’is fingers stiff an’ frozen,
With the ice upon the gaskets an’ her canvas

If ’e’d ’ad to shorten sail
In a good Antarctic gale,

If ’e’d ’ad to pick the weevils from the biskit an’

That it wa’ant to pick the biskit from the weevils

’E’d a-told a touchin’ story of a cove as died on

With a fig o’ black terbakker or a whisky in ’is

For, concernin’ graft an’ vittles,
’Taint exsactly beer an’ skittles
With the able-bodied joker on the “mighty

On the “ deep an’ vasty hoshun,”
With its cargo of emoshun,
An’ its “ martyrs ” servin’ forrard an’ its “ ’eros ”

’Oly Smoke ! I meets the skipper of a bloomin’

An’ ’e ought to feel right thankful for ’is sorrers

’Ow the likker was Ole Satan, an’ the t’other kinds

So I see ’is good intention,
An’ I didn’t want to mention
That I’d like to back “ Temptation ” an’ the “ vile

An’ be certain sure to win it,
For a “ Christyun soul ” ain’t in it
With one night ashore in fifty an’ a little bit o’tin.
“ ’Arf-a-pint again an’ thankee. . . . ’Ere’s

May y’u never ’ave to yakker as a qualiyfied A.B.
May y’u never be a syler of the mercantile marine,
Or y’u’ll always be a syler, an’ y’u’ll never ’ave a

Oh, yer “Jack the king of all,” sir, ’fore yer
bloomin’ stuff is spent;
Yer a “ drunken syler feller ” w’en ’er sails is bein’

But it’s round the world a-goin,
With the ebbin’ an’ the flowin’,
An’ y’u needn’t fear the bailiff, an’ y’u needn’t pay

There’s a month or two at sea,
Then a rattlin’, roarin’ spree . . .
An' I dunno if I left it that I'd ever he content!

Dear Bulletin. —A tight place and a tem-
perance-story. My mate, George, after drinking
too much at the shanty, started for camp, and
safely reached the level crossing over the railway ;
dismounting, he hung the bridle over his arm in
the most approved fashion, opened one gate, and,
stumbling against the first line of rails, fell fairly
across the track and went asleep. The rest of the
story was told him by the driver of the early
morning mail train which came along shortly after
daybreak. When the train neared the crossing
the driver, noticing a horse standing close to the
line, blew his engine whistle loud and long ; the
horse started back, but did not leave its dangerous
position, and the driver then saw for the first time
that there was a man across the rails with his arm
through the animal’s bridle. He immediately put
his brakes on and whistled again ; once more the
horse jerked back, and this time succeeded in
pulling his sleeping master clear of one rail, but
left him still lying across the other. The driver,
seeing it was impossible to stop ere reaching the
crossing, gave another soul-stirring blast of his
whistle, hoping to wake the man, whose only
chance of life appeared to rest on his regaining
consciousness during the next lOsec.; and the
horse, now nearly mad with fright, made one
supreme effort and just landed the noble (feorge
(still asleep) clear of the rails when the train
rushed by. George has now transferred his affec-
tion for alcohol to his horse.—WA RKKN.

say pathetically—“from the bishop to the man-
gling-woman. And he’s such a little liar. ”
And his father’s heart would be scathed, and
would burn and writhe within his stem, old, black-
vested breast, at the thought of that tiny wicked
one, whose word no man or woman could rely on.
That a child of his could tell a lie was a thing too
infamous, too unutterably degrading, too —too—
scandalous, he told himself, though, as a matter
of fact, there was no scandal at all, only a good
many amused smiles, and maybe a few more kisses
from outsiders for the miscreant.
The minister never could understand how a child
of his had come by such a fault.
The mother said her people had never told a lie
in their lives—not counting the one she was telling.
The father said that his father, and grand-
father, and great-grandfather, and farther back if
there was any farther back, had all been whipped
every Saturday night, from childhood to adult
age, and no lie had ever been beaten out of one of
them. Ho was sure the child didn’t get it from
him.
There was an old, old grandmother of his,
though, whom he remembered in his childhood’s
days having detected in something perilously like
a lie. She had told his mother that he had
poked his finger through the covering of a jar of
jam, and his mother had whipped him, and even
after all these years he was keenly conscious that
he had not done it. Perhaps the mantle of that
long-dead grandmother had fallen on to little
Dolly’s shoulders.
There was the affair of the tooth-brush. For
three days running the minister had noticed a
slight unnaturalness of hue, a certain unhealthy
pinkiness, a peculiar moist flabbiness and depres-
sion of the hairs of his tooth-brush. And it never
seemed to him to lie as he had placed it last. It
was generally lying face-downwards, though he
never remembered having left it in that abject
condition.
The lady visitor, too, who was staying in the
house, had a horrid suspicion that her tooth-powder
had been touched. Twice she found the box all
wet and dabbed, and once the lid was off. She
was too polite to say anything, and tried to dismiss
her thoughts.
But, on the fourth day, the climax came. The
minister, going into his room before tea-time,
found his tooth-brush lying a brilliant sticky red
on the washstand. Beside it was a little heap of
pink powder in a pool of water, and beside that
the box itself. Dolly had been called away, and
had run off and forgotten blissfully that those
accusing implements lay there to his undoing.
They all knew at once that it was Dolly.
“Now, Dolly, tell the truth. You did it, didn’t
you, dear?” said his mother, coaxingly.
“ No. Didn’t!” said Dolly, shaking his head
till the little sunny curls bobbed round with merri-
ment.
And “No” he persisted in. He was beaten with
the minister’s slipper and sent to bed in the dark
without any tea, but after a few minutes’ pensive
gazing at the tiny far-off stars through his win-
dow, he fell asleep, and forgot alike hunger, slip-
per, and tooth-brush.
But the minister never forgot the tooth-brush.
* * *
Dolly grew older, and the time came for
him to go to school. Curls were cut off, and
sailor suits took the place of velvet coats and
Fauntleroy costumes.
It was a boarding-school he was to go to, and
the master was a personal friend of the minister’s.
He was young, and had been once an English
public-school teacher. He had never quite suc-
ceeded in shaking off the dust of the public-school
from his feet. He believed, too, that there were
in the world but one school and one master. That
school was his school, and that master was himself.
Dolly had been there scarcely a month before
the smallness of the master’s spirit received full
recognition from him.
Dolly and a boy named Bolster were playing
practice cricket one day perilously near the
master’s side of the school. Bolster was bowling,
and sent in a ball that seemed aimed at Dolly’s
brain - He stepped aside, and as it went past hit
°, ut ®f nt 't away behind wicket,
straight through the window of one of the master s
rooms. There was a crash.
F or one awful moment Bolster and Dolly felt
that legs were legs, and run they must. Then
courage came to Dolly, and he stood his ground.
“Crikes !” hesaid “won’t therebe a row !”
Lets clear, said Bolster. Nobody s look-
ing> and Wll c ’ ut down through the trees to the
river and be having a swim by the time they look
for us. ”
“ khh Bags’ll be sure to ask.”
“ ™, we won’t say anything.”
.Perhaps hell ask us one by one.
“Well, we’ll say we didn’t.”
“ What’s the good of telling a lie ?” said Dolly,
“’Tisn’t worth it.” By this time they were scud-
away through a belt of trees to the water.
Well, you wouldn t mind, said Bolster,
<< \v oU J dn ’t j •>»
“No. Bags told some of the fellows before you
came that you were an awful young liar, and your
da d couldn’t do anything with you at home. ”
d^e , fbdn . said Dolly, who had quite for-
gotten the wickedness of his childhood.

“He did,” said Bolster.
“ You’re a liar ” said Dollv.
“ I’ll punch your head,” said Bolster.
* Will you ?” said Dolly. “ You’d better try,”
■ . ext mmut e they were at it with whirling fists :
wa s a umeful time for Bolster. Big he was, and
ample oi tlesli, but nis star was clown and Hol]y s s
wa s up. Dolly sat on him finally and extorted a
81 , admission of error : then, leaving the enemy
subdued and tearfully black-eyed, he walked away
towards the schoolhouse and made confession of
tie broken glass, altogether omitting Bolster’s
1 ia i ( n e ; r° n ‘ t<ie story.
~ ’ bel > “ u ‘this happen . asked the chief,
About half-an-hour ago, said Dolly.
And you tell me now ! ” He sawed the air
with his cane. “ Well,” he said, smilingly, “it is
just what 1 should have expected from you. You
o reak my windows and try and conceal it from mo.
How very honorable 1”
“ But I’ve told you,” said Dolly, aghast.
“Don’t equivocate! Don’t make bad worse!
When a boy of your age can deceive so flagrantly,
how will it be when you become a man ? I must
punish you.”
Then came the caning. It went deeper than the
flesh. It cut its way to Dolly’s heart, and mangled
up a corner of his spirit.
Bolster and he were friends again, but his heart
was always a little heavier. It had that statement
of Bolster’s to carry now.
* * *
At last Dolly’s school-days came to an end.
One day the master found two mistakes in a paper
of Bolster’s, and an exact reproduction of them in
a paper of Dolly’s, who had sat next to him. He
drew his own deductions.
Dolly said he hadn’t copied. Bolster said
nothing.
“ It’s a coincidence, I suppose ?” said the master.
He sighed. “ What is one to do with a boy whose
whole career is a lie ?” he said, his eyes on Dolly.
“Look here,” said Dolly, jumping up in a
sudden mad fury, “ you old beast! I didn’t
do it. I’ll take my oath I didn’t. You’ve got a
down on me. You always had. And I’ll tell you
what —there isn’t a chap in the school that doesn’t
know that you tell lies by the million. Gammon-
ing you know Greek and Latin and ”
He choked with rage, and there was an appalled
silence for a minute. The whiteness of the mas-
ter’s face was as remarkable a thing in its way
as was the turkey-red of Dolly’s.
“You’re a cad!” wound up Dolly.
“Mr. Pritchard,” said the master to his
assistant. “ You hear him ! And all you boys.
You hear him. You’re all witnesses of what I
have put up with from this young— blackguard /
Go out of my school, ” he said, losing control of
himself, as a boy in the back seat giggled. “Go
on !” He darted towards Dolly and dealt him an
undignified, terrific box on the ears.
“ I won’t touch you,” said Dolly, his face white
now. “My boots are clean.” A thrill went round
the forms, and that speech became a tradition of
the school. It will be spoken of years hence.
Dolly went straight up to his robin, got his hat,
stuffed his things into his trunk, then carried it
in his arms and went away into the street, with
no backward look at the school he was leaving for
ever.
Late that evening a boy with angry eyes and a
trunk and bat in his arms rang the front bell of
the parsonage and announced to his astonished
parents : “I’ve come home. I got expelled.”
Thus ended his school-days.
The mother had a leaning for Dolly’s side of the
story.
“ He didn't copy, you know,” she protested to
the minister.
“ Who says he didn’t ? ”
“ He says so.”
“ Did you ever know him to tell the truth ? ”
said the minister. “ Has he not lied from his
birth up ? Why should we believe him now ? ”
And so those whom Dolly might have counted
his allies deserted him, and their sentence
was very bitter against him. His mother, indeed,
asked him in a gentler tone than usual would he
have meat for his breakfast; but nobody said a
word of sympathy, and he understood that a wall
was being built on the other side of which he was
expected to keep.
* * *
The minister wrote to a friend in Sydney
about Dolly. There was a vacancy in the friend’s
office, and Dolly must work now.
“I will pay you a premium,” he wrote, “but
though he is my own and only son I must, in
duty to God and you, warn you that his word can
never be relied on. His intelligence is keen, and I
believe that ho is capable of most things if he have
the will. He may prove himself of great value to
you. But 1 beseech you not to put him into situa-
tions too trying. Check him as far as you can. .
. . It is as a favor to myself that t shall look
upon your engagement of him. . , .”
And this was Holly’s letter of introduction to
the world. The mother protested a little against
it.
“ It will prejudice them so,” she said.
“ It is my duty” said the minister,
* * *
There was a girl Dolly used to meet at the
tennis-club, a dark-haired, dark-eyed girl, with a
straightforward look, and a bright, sweet smile.
She was the only daughter of the man in whoso
office ho was.
She and Dolly played sets together, and more
often won than lost. She was a splendid server.,
and Dolly was a powerful volleyer. They fell
into the way of talking to each other between play;
he would bring her tea and watch her while she
drank it, and she would tell him bits of girlish
chatter about herself.
And when the tennis was over for the day, Dolly
got into a habit of waiting about, picking up stray
balls, and fixing things about the court while she
changed her shoes and put on her gloves. They
would walk home together slowly, without seeing
anything or anybody but themselves.
She knew Dolly hated the office. She had an
idea, too, that her father was not partial to Dolly.
Once a month, perhaps, he asked him to tea, but
that was for his father’s sake, not for his own.
She was friendly, though—always. It seemed to
Dolly that the world began and ended with her.
He wrote home and told his mother about her.
Then she went to Melbourne for a month, and
at parting she gave him a curl of her hair, a glove
she had worn, and one kiss from her tender mouth.
She left it to Dolly to tell her father.
The kiss was a fair seal to Dolly’s fate.
Dor while she was away something happened in
the office, and the idyll ended. Thirty pounds dis-
appeared mysteriously, nobody knew how.
All the clerks were questioned, Dolly among
them, but they all denied any knowledge of the
matter.
After hours that day was the time Dolly han
chosen for speaking to her father. His face was
unusually bright. He hummed and whistled to
himself, and was restless, and a little nervous.
Poor Dolly ! It all told against him.
Instead of going of his own accord and asking
boldly for her hand, he was called into the little
legal room when the clock struck five, and was
accused point-blank of embezzlement.
All his denials were in vain. He was astounded,
then horrified, then wrathful, and protested his
innocence angrily ; but the fiat was sharp and
short.
“ I have known of your character ever since you
came here. Your father warned me. Now, for
his sake I'll spare you ; you shall not be exposed
as you deserve to be: but when you go home you
must tell your father everything, and ! trust, for
his sake, that this sin of yours will be the last as
well as the first. ”
He showed Dolly the letter the minister had
written him. After that there was nothing
to do but go. And with a black cloud over
him that chapter of his life was closed.
In an agony he wrote to Mollie. Three times he
wrote. Twice she paid no heed. But in reply to
the third letter came back a lock of his hair and a
withered sprig of heliotrope he had given her.
* * *
He went about the world afterwards with
a stone where his heart had been, and his face was
hardened with lines that the years never softened
away. All the sweetness of his nature turned to
gall.
As for the minister, the schoolmaster and the
employer, they all believed they had done their
duty. They even complimented themselves upon
the way they had done it.
LOUISE M. MACK.
“Colonial Experience,"
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was a good fellow—the boss liked him,
the hands liked him ; in fact, we all liked him.
It was only eight months since he had come
from England to Yowlahmine Station with a letter
of recommendation to Mr. Foster, our boss. His
name was Edward—Ted we used to call him, Ted
Oscott. Nobody thought of calling him Mister
now, except Maggie M ‘Farlane.
Maggie’s father was the married man on the
home station. Ted thought a lot of Maggie, and
often used to sit with her under the old fig-tree
behind the store of a night and tell her about
England and his people.
One night he asked her why she didn’t call him
“Ted’’and not “Mister Oscott.” She said she
didn’t like, as he might think her forward. Maggie
was very shy.
Ted thought he would change the conversation,
so he asked her if she knew that Murphy was
leaving. Murphy was one of the married boun-
dary-riders.
Maggie said she had heard her father saying some-
thing about it, and she was very glad if it was
true ; because she never did like Murphy, and
didn t want to see him any more—or his wife,
either.
Ted assured her that it was true, and the boss
had offered the billet to him (Ted), remarking at
the time that it would be a good chance for him to
marry Maggie.
Ted then drew a little closer, and asked her if
he might tell Mr. Foster that he would take his
offer. Maggie said she would see what her father
said.
Anyhow, it was soon arranged. They were to
ride into Nerribong on Monday, get married and
spend a few days, and then on Sunday ride home
to Murphy’s, where everything would be ready for
them.
* * *
Nerribong, Saturday night. Maggie had
gone to bed, and Ted was paying Hennessy the
landlord for the week’s accommodation, when who
should walk into the bar but Murphy. Ted
ordered drinks, and Murphy wished him luck and
told him he had got another job, at Greendale,
and was going out in the morning. Then they
went to bed.
When Ted walked into the yard next morning,
two horses were hung up at the post, saddled.
One was Murphy’s; the other the one that Maggie
had ridden in from Yowlahmine. Murphy had
brought them up from the paddock, but couldn’t
find Ted’s horse anywhere. Ted went to look for
him, but with no success.
When he came back Maggie was mounted and
ready, and Murphy was pulling down the slip-
rails to let her pass through. Having got both horses
outside, he carefully replaced the rails and bade
Ted “ Good morning !”
“Wait a minute,” says Ted. “ Where are
you going ?”
“ Greendale,” answers Murphy.
“ She going with you ?”
“Yes.”
“ Going to stay with you ?”
“ But where’s your wife ?”
“Left her at Yowlahmine—she expects von
to-night. ”
“Ah, well,” savs Ted, “you had better come
and have a drink before you go. It’s pretty snltrv
this morning. ”
“Going to have a hot day, I think,” savs
Murphy.
Ted thought so too.
He was a good fellow—we all liked him. lie
hasn’t come back from Nerribong yet.

STEELMAV'S
PVPIL
FOR THE BULLETIN
Steelman was a hard case, but some said that
Smith was harder. Steelman was big and good-
looking, and good-natured in his way; he was a
“spieler,” pure and simple, but did things in
humorous style. Smith was small and weedy—of
the sneak variety ; he had a whining tone and a
cringing manner. He seemed to be always so
afraid you were going to hit him that he would
make you want to hit him on that account alone.
Steelman ‘ ‘ had ” you in a fashion that would
make your friends laugh. Smith would ‘ ‘ have ” you
in a way which made you feel mad at the bare
recollection of having been taken in by so con-
temptible a little sneak.
They battled round together in the North Island
of Maoriland for a couple of years.
One day Steelman said to Smith :
“ Look here, Smithy, you don’t know you’re
born yet. I’m going to take you in hand and teach
you. ”
And he did. If Smith wouldn’t do as Steelman
told him, or wasn’t successful in cadging, or
“ mugged ” any game they had in hand, Steelman
would threaten to “stoush” him; and, if the
warning proved ineffectual after the second or
third time, he would “stoush ” him.
One day, on the track, they came to a place
where an old Scottish couple kept a general store
and shanty. They camped alongside the road,
and Smith was just starting up to the house to beg
supplies when Steelman cried :
“ Here ! —hold on. Now where do you think
you’re going to ? ”
“ Why, I’m going to try and chew the old
party’s lug, of course. We’ll be out of tucker in
a couple of days,” said Smith.
Steel man sat
down on a stump
in a hopeless, dis-
couraged sort of
way.
“ It’s no use,”
he said, regarding
Smith with min-
gled reproach and
disgust. “It’s no
use. I might as
well give it best.
I can see that it’s
only waste of time
trying to learn you
anything. Will
I ever be able to
knock some
gumption into
your thick skull ?
After all the time
and trouble and
pains I’ve took
with your educa-
tion, you hain’t
got any more sense
than to go and
mug a business
l.ke that ! When
will you learn
sense? Hey?
After all, I——
Smith, you’re a
bom mug !”
He always called
Smith a “mug”
when he was par-
ticularly wild at
him, for it hurt
Smith more than
anything else.
“ There’s only
two classes in the
world, spielers and
mugs—and you’re
a mug, Smith.”
“ What have I
done, anyway ?”
asked Smith help-
lessly. “ That’s
all I want to
know.”
Steelman weari-
ly rested his brow
on his hand.
’ ‘ That will do,
Smith,” he said
listlessly; “don’t
say another word,
old man ; it’ll only
make my head
worse ; don’t talk.
You might, at the
very least, have
a little considera-
tion for my feel-
ings—even if you
haven’t for your
own interests.”
He paused and
regarded Smith
sadly. ~ Well,
I’ll give you an-
other show. I’ll
stage the business
for you.”
He made Smith doff his coat and get into his
worst pair of trousers —and they were bad enough;
they were hopelessly “gone,” beyond the extreme
limit of bush decency. He made Smith put on a
rag of a felt hat and a pair of “ ’lastic sides ”
which had fallen off a tramp and lain baking and
rotting by turns on a rubbish-heap; they had to
he tied on Smith with bits of rag and string. He
drew dark shadows round Smith’s eyes, and
burning spots on his cheek-bones with some grease-
paints he used when they travelled as “ The
Great Steelman and Smith Combination Star
■Shakesperian Dramatic Co.” He damped Smith’s
hair to make it dark and lank and his face more
corpse-like by comparison—in short, he “made
him up ” to look like a man who had long passed
the very last stage of consumption, and had been
artificially kept alive in the interests of science.
“Now you’re ready,” said Steelman to Smith,
“You left your whare the day before yesterday
and started to walk to the hospital at Palmerston.
An old mate picked you up dying on the road,
brought you round, and carried you on his
back most of the way here. You firmly
believe that Providence had something to do with
the sending m
that old mate
along at that
time and place
above all others.
Your mate also
was hard-up ; he
was going to a
job the first
show for work
he’d had in nine
months—but he
gave it up to see
you through;
he’d give up his
life rather than
desert a mate in
trouble. You
only want a
couple of shil-
. mgs or a bit of
tucker to help
you on to Pal-
merston. You
know you’ve got
to die, and you
only want to live
long enough to
get word to your
poor old mother,
and die on a bed.
“ Remember,
they’re Scotch
up at that house.
You understand
the Scotch bar-
rack pretty well
by now—if you
don’t it ain’t my
fault. You were
born in Aber-
deen, but came
out too young to
remember much
about the town.
“Smith took the pawn-ticket to Steelman next day.”
Your father’s dead. You ran away to sea and
came out in the Bob ole Burns to Sydney. Your
poor old mother’s in Aberdeen now —Bruce or
Wallace Wynd will do. Your mother might
be dead now—poor old soul! —anyway, you’ll
never see her again. You wish you’d never run
away from home. You wish you’d been a better
son to your poor old mother; you wish you’d
written to her and answered her last letter. You
only want to live long enough to write home and
ask for forgiveness and a blessing before you die.

you up you might get along the road better. (Put
this delicately.) Get the whine out of your voice
and breathe with a wheeze—like this ; get up the
nearest approach to a death-rattle that you can.
Move as if you were badly hurt in your wind

Something tells you that you won’t see the new
year—it’s a week off Xmas now. And, if you
come back without anything, I’ll blessed soon put
you out of your misery.”
Smith came back with about four pounds
of short-bread and as much various tucker as they
could conven-
iently carry; a
pretty good suit
of cast-off
tweeds; a new
pair of ’lastio
sides from the
store stock; two
bottles of patent
medicine and a
black bottle half-
full of home-
made consump-
tion-cure ; also a
letter to a hospi-
tal - committee-
man, and three
shillings to help
him on his way
to Palmerston.
He also got
about half a mile
of sympathy, re-
ligious consola-
tion, and medi-
cal advice which
he didn’t re-
member.
“Wow,” he
said, triumph-
antly, “am I(a
mug or not ?”
Steelman
kindly ignored
the question.
“ I did have a
better opini on of
the Scotch,” he
said, contemptu-
ously.
* *
Steelman got
on at an hotel
as billiard-
marker and decoy, and in six months he managed
that pub. Smith, who’d been away on his own
account, turned up in the town one day, clean-
broke, and in a deplorable state. He heard of
Steelman’s luck, and thought he was “all right,”
so went to his old friend.
Cold type—or any other kind of type—couldn’t
do justice to Steelman’s disgust. To think that
this was the reward of all the time and trouble
he’d spent on Smith’s education ! However, when
he cooled down, he said :
“ Smith, you’re a young man yet, and it’s never
too late to mend. There is still time for reforma-
tion. I can’t help you now; it would only
demoralise you altogether. To think, after the
way I trained you, you can’t battle round any
better’n this ! I always thought you were an
irreclaimable mug, but I expected better things of
you towards the end. I thought I’d make some-
thing of you. It’s enough to dishearten any man
and disgust him with the world. Why! you
ought to be a rich man now with the chances and
training you had ! To think —but I won’t talk of
that; it has made me ill. I suppose I’ll have to
give you something, if it’s only to get rid of the
sight of you. Here’s a quid, and I’m a mug fo f
giving it to you. It’ll do you more harm than
good ; and it ain’t a friendly thing nor the right
thing for me—who always had your welfare at
heart—to give it to you under the circumstances;
Now, get away out of my sight, and don’t come
near me till you’ve reformed. If you do, I’ll have
to stoush you out of regard for my own health and
feelings.”
* ♦ *
But Steelman came down in the world
again and picked up Smith on the road, and they
“ battled round ” together for another year or so ;
and at last they were in Wellington —Steelman
“flush” and stopping at an hotel, and Smith
stumped, as usual, and staying with a friend. One
night they were drinking together at the hotel, at
the expense of some “ mugs ” whom Steelman was
“ educating. ” It was raining hard. When Smith
was going home he said :
“Look here, Steely, old man. Listen to the
rain ! I’ll get wringing wet going home. You
might as well lend me your overcoat to-night.
You won’t want it, and I won’t hurt it.”
And, Steelman’s heart being warmed by his
successes, he lent the overcoat.
Smith went and pawned it, got glorious on the
proceeds, and took the pawn-ticket to Steelman,
next day.
Smith had reformed.

“And J taught him!” Steelman would
say, proudly, in after-years, in concluding his cele-
brated dog-yarn. “ Poor old Smith ! He could
battle round all right. I taught him. ”

WHERE SILENCE
REICNS
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Out back, where silence reigneth, on the great
grey Western plains
(Those “sunlit plains” of Clancy’s), where it
hardly ever rains;
Where the traveller’s always thirsty and the water
never near—
The creaking of the saddle is the only sound we
hear.
The quart-pot doesn’t rattle, and the stirrup
doesn’t clink,
The emu stalks in freedom, and it’s far too hot to
think ;
Where tracks are dry and dusty, and the air is
seldom clear,
The creaking of the saddle is a lonesome sound to
hear.
The fences reach to sundown and are mostly built
of wire,
And the sun goes down each evening like a glow-
ing disc of fire;
When the water-bag is empty, and the tucker
dry and dear,
The creaking of the saddle is a mournful sound to
hear.
Moving specks in distance hazy we regard for
hours m doubt,
Till we find they’re teams and tank-scoops shifting
camp to “ further out ” ;
And the quaintly-dancing brolgas at our coming
show no fear—
While the creaking of the saddle is the only sound
we hear.
Where the tumbling “ roley-poley ” of its sport-
ne’er seems to tire,
And mocking lakes of water rouse the sunburn
traveller's ire ;
Our knocked-up dog lies panting ’neath a mulg.i
in the rear,
And the creaking of the saddle is the only sound
we hear.
The dusty streaks of sweat-lines cake along our
horse’s flank,
And the only break of level is the mudheap at the
tank ;
When our seat feels damp and sticky and our
spine feels somewhat queer —
The creaking of the saddle is a wretched sound to
hear.
Stretched in shade of gidya bushes lies a great
red kangaroo,
Sleeping through the sultry noonday; while a
doleful-looking crow,
With a voiceless gape, salutes us as we come and
disappear.
And the creaking of the saddle is the only sound
we hear.
For miles and miles around us spreads the silent
plain and gray,
And we sigh for rippling water or the rattle of a
dray ;
E’en the sight of river timber would relax our
“lot austere,”
When the ever-creaking saddle is the only sound
we hear.
Half sleeping and half waking we dream of shady
lanes,
The whistle of the steamboats or the cheerful rush
of trains ;
Cool, green nooks in quiet gullies, ice-cold springs
and restful cheer —
But the sadly-creaking saddle is the only sound
we hear.
So we crawl along, in silence cursing “Banjo’s ”
great grey plain,
And the heat, and dust, and distance, then we
curse them all again ;
“ And their kindly voices greet him” seems like
sarcasm or a sneer—
For the creaking of the saddle is the only sound
wo hear.
Sad and sultry leagues of silence, bounded by a
shimmering sky,
Make a man feel very lonely, very small and very
dry ;
We would cry in desolation but we cannot shed a
tear,
And the creaking of the saddle is the only sound
we hear.
As we feel the dreary silence stealing o’er our
senses dim,
We imagine we are sinking and would rather sink
than swim;
And we have a vague, weird fancy that Death is
hovering near,
While the ever-creaking saddle is the only sound
we hear.

The Delights of the Bush .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Among a certain fatuous class of writers there has
always existed a custom of sending forth gushes
of gladsome song, and warbling, in more or less
tuneful warbs, about the pleasures of country life.
.The miserable wretch who is condemned by hard
fate to live in the city, with all its inconveniences
such as postal deliveries, and newspapers, and
shops, and trams —is held up to the gaze of public
sympathy; while all are requested to envy the
lucky individual whose habitation is in the back-
woods, about 387 miles from nowhere in particular,
who lives in a humpy made of seven sheets of
stringy-bark, with three big rocks on top to hold
the roof, and who has to walk seven miles for his
mail. When he does walk the seven miles he
usually finds that there is no mail, as the mailman
couldn’t cross Buggabulla “crick,” or has lost his
horses, or is drunk, or something.
It is time that some hard-fisted resident of the
back-country formed himself into a Royal Com-
mission to inquire into the best mode of inflict-
ing capital punishment, diversified with flog-
gings, on the perjurers who so wantonly trifle
with the immortal truth. If a ton or two
of these miscreants were placed in the hands
of a conscientious forwarding-agent, and dumped
down in judiciously chosen spots in the black-
blocks where they would have to chop wood, and
cook damper, and boil junk, and “graft ” hard all
day, and walk to the township for provisions, and
do without society and clean shirts and socks, the
amount of imbecile verse on the glorious lot of the
bush-dweller would be reduced by several cubic
yards. I know it—l have lived in the bush till
the light of my once beauteous hazel eyes has
become dimmed with suffering, and the noble
chestnut curls that once adorned my commanding
brow have vanished into thin hair. And when
something does occur which momentarily lifts a
man from the black gulf of despondency into
which he has sunk, it is morally certain that some-
thing else occurs which has the effect of making
him feel much the same as ever—only more so.
Here is an illustration. •
One of the many afflictions which I bear —wh.i
as large a quantity of fortitude as is possible tor
one wfio, after all, is but human—is the nightly
visitation of numerous bovines of inquiring char-
acter and assorted sexes. My hut is not fenced in;
indeed, it would probably make no difference if it
were, lor, when the average bush cow means busi-
ness, such a trifle as a fence does not daunt her.
So, about the time I am snugly settled in my
bunk, and have knocked the ashes out of my last
pipe, some robust young steer begins to paw up
the dirt outside with sickening thuds, preparatory
to organising a party to prospect for soap, or
towels, or skirts, or similar delicacies. Pretty
soon his comrades, and the milky mothers of the
herd, and the little cowlets and eleven or eight
working bullocks chip in. They eat up any soap
that is left about, also saddlecloths and under-
shirts and pyjamas and socks. Then they “moo.”
Singly at first, then as a number of duettists,
afterwards in trios, and eventually their fresh
young voices ring out in the frosty atmosphere as
a full orchestral symphony. Sometimes they go
away after this, but generally they stay till day-
light.
One night I arose in my wrath and a brief shirt,
and hunted them all away, through a very irri-
tating wattle-scrub, for about two miles and a dis-
tance. When I returned, covered with splinters
and perspiration, 1 found that I had overlooked
two brindled steers and their ma. They were
inside the hut chewing my blankets.
What is the use of a man forming a resolution
not to swear V
The exertion of pursuit and the subsequent
wrath did not agree with me. 1 took a chill and
afterwards contracted inflammation of the lungs,
combined with two large abscesses on the liver
and a rupture of the bicuspid artery. I also
stubbed my great toe while pursuing the oxen.
Prompt remedial measures were necessary, so I
made a roomy mustard-plaster and applied it to
the ailing parts. Next day I threw it out. It
seemed excite some curiosity among the leading
members of the herd which visited me at sundown.
A meditative, matronly-looking old cow elbowed
one of her daughters out of the way and tackled
the poultice in a sort of nil admirari manner.
But she got a fair grip and laid it well back on
her tongue. Then the poultice began to get its
work in.
The female ox laid it down, sighed deeply, and
went away to look for sour grass.
The next candidate was a red steer that I had
once helped to pull out of a shaft. On that occa-
sion, he had put down hi*' head and “charged ”
his rescuers as soon as he emerged. He opened
the plaster out before sampling it, and then got
about seven ounces of the mustard well under his
tongue before his suspicions were aroused. Then
he retired to the creek, breathing hard.
I thought I had hit on a splendid idea. Visions
of taking out a patent for the invention, and
getting about £lO,OOO royalty from the Agricul-
tural Bureau, flashed across my mind. I was posi-
tively exhilarated. Por the first time in 13 months
I smiled ! The thought that I had at last got
level with those piratical beeves had a truly won-
derful effect on my sorrow-laden bosom. Por five
minutes I was ecstatically happy.
Then one of my most constant interviewers came
along. His name is Strawberry, and he is a
working bullock. “ Working ”is a courtesy title,
:given to Strawberry because he is yoked up with
the team, but it has no real significance, for Straw-
berry has long since abandoned any idea of pulling.
He is a gaunt male beast, and is scored with
•ancient whip-marks, so that he looks like a railway
map. His favorite food is gunnybags, but he will
■also eat tarpaulins and bridles.
Strawberry ambled up, with a modest confidence
oozing out of every square inch of his weather-
beaten hide. He swallowed the poultice without
a tear. In fact, he lingered over it as if he loved
it, and I saw him chewing the cud of that mus-
tard-plaster three weeks afterwards.
When I get over this spree, I am going to try
the effect on Strawberry of a compost of arsenious
acid spread on dynamite.

HOW IT HAEPENS.
A STUDY
FROM WITHIN
FOR THE BULLETIN
There was a pause in the conversation. Cockerell
had been firing off his theories till nobody else
appeared to have a word to say.
Cockerell was five-feet-nothing, and, therefore,
self-important; nineteen, with a prominent under-
jaw, and, therefore, dogmatic. Also, he was a
medical student who believed he had been born to
revolutionise the psychologic branch of his art.
“ So, you see,” he had perorated, “we are bound
to get away in time from this maudlin condonation
of murder as possibly the result of sudden, irresist-
ible imp ilse in persons who have not otherwise ap-
peared to be insane. Now, there’s that fellow
who killed his wife, the other day—•—”
“May I ask, young gentleman,” said the man
in the corner, “if you ever killed your wife ?”
He was one of those long, lean, grizzled men
who give you, somehow, the impression of having
also grizzled souls. His wide, pale eyes had a
chronically-astonished look, and his voice had the
muffled rotundity of a voice used inside a cask.
Eyes settled on him all round. The fuzzy-
headed barmaid sneered and smiled —the guarded,
sneerful smile of a woman with false teeth. The
pig-faced man in the tartan necktie stood with his
mouth open for the little cube of cheese which his
hand had forgotten to forward to its destination.
The white-whiskered old buccaneer on the window
seat “was d dif that wasn’t a good ’un !”
Even the grimy cockatoo, waking up for half-a-
minute, made a chance hit with “ Wotcher-givin’-
us ?”
“ Because, you see,” went on the cavern-voiced
man, “if you’ve never killed your own wife, you
simply don’t know what you’re talking about. ”
Cockerell, with his little lashless eye on the foe,
disposed of his whisky in a dozen deliberate sips
before he got hold of what he thought was a
crusher.
“Am I to presume, friend, that you have the
advantage of me in that respect ?”
The long man, lighting a veteran briar, nodded
cheerfully through the smoke. “ You are !” he
said.
“What? Oh, you mean in having had a wife
at all!”
“ No ; I mean in having killed her !”
Cockerell turned impatiently away. “ Shoo !”
he said. “ ’Nother whisky, my dear.”
“Yes,” went on the wide-eyed man, placidly,
as the barmaid officiated. “ I had a wife. Audi
killed her. And I propose, if you have no objec-
tion, to explain why.”
“Callan Park?” said Cockerell to the barmaid.
She heaved her monstrous shoulder-puffs up to
her powdered ears. “Or Gladesville !” she snig-
gered.
“Neither,” said the man in the corner. “Nor
yet Parramatta or Yarra Bend. Though there are
saner men in those places than I.”
“ Hear —hear !” from Cockerell.
“ Or you!”
“My good fellow,” began the barmaid, in a
majestic squeak.
“ Exactly ! ” interrupted the hollow voice. “It
is because I am a good fellow that I’m going to
give this young gentleman the chance of reducing
the size of his head by listening to a man who has
approached this subject from within, and not,
like the ‘medical experts,’ entirely db extra.”
Curiosity dawned on Cockerell’s ferretty face.
“ Well,” he said, “ you seem to be a man of edu-
cation, and you don’t appear to be cranky. Do
you seriously mean to assert that you have com-
mitted murder ? ”
“I shall not reiterate! But, if this young
woman’s dignity is not too stupendous to let her
provide me—in exchange for threepence, current
silver coin of the realm—with one imperial pint
of alleged beer —I will go on with my story. I
had, as I have already had the pleasure of observ-
ing, a wife—the best of wives ! ”
“Oh, of course!” sneered the barmaid as the
narrator stepped to the counter for his beer. “ A
man’s wife is always an angel—when she isn’t a
devil.”
“Damsel,” said
the long man, re-
seating himself,
“ you but express
a truth which was
recognised 2000
years before the
invention of bar-
maidens. Gorruptio
optimi fit pessimum I
Your young friend
will translate for
you. ”
Her young friend
looked foolish, and
the man with the
pewter went on:
“ This woman—
loving, forgiving,
self-sacrificing, loyal
—was tied to a
d runkard me 1
Some wise-acre has
said that men who
drink beer think
beer and act beer.
If so, I, for one,
am glad of it. When
I drank spirits in
such floods as only
the highly-organised
drunkard finds him
self compelled to
swallow, the whole
mental machinery
would run at such
feverish speed as to
become presently
dislocated and dan-
gerous. With this ”
—he held up the
pewter—“the worst
that happens is a
slight unscrewing of
the pivots of intelli-
gence. Well. I
drank, and refrain-
ed, and drank until
I tasted at last of
that unspeakable
horror, the dread
that, having partly
lost at times the self-
'■mtrolling power.
I might at any moment kvo .t altogether. And
I did.”
The man got up and stood by a corner of the
bar, with his eyes on the floor, and a forefinger
pressed into his cheek.
“It was in the early morning. I had been
drinking for weeks, but I had slacked off. I was
’”— he shuddered reminiscently—
undergoing the murderous oscillation between
bitter, self-contemptuous waking, and fitful, hell-
tormented sleep. And it was in the grey of dawn
that it came to me—the soul-paralysing conscious-
ness that I had suddenly developed that inverted
action of the will by which a man is impelled
towards whatever _he most violently abhors. I
looked at the faithful, long-suffering creature
sleeping by my side. ‘ Great God !’ I said to my-
self, ‘ I understand them now—the sudden, inex-
plicable slaughters that the world wonders at.
lliey spring from a very intensity of repugnance
to the act. ’ The revelation was worse than death !
and it showed me also, in a flash, the reason
for a thousand suicides—uncomprehended, be-
cause incoinprehensible by the mind that has
never peeped over the fence of normality.
Many a wretch, I understood, must have killed
himself to keep himself from killing those he loved.
I would do that, at all events, I resolved. Re-
solved ! —the word had no meaning for a man in
my state. I would kill nobody!—l would kill
myself !—I would kill her ! Nobody !—myself!—
her! So, in dreadful cycles, went my thought,
till-—with the sudden conviction that the end
would depend upon the point of recurrence at
which this mad anarchy of impulse would become
unendurable—there fell upon me the dreadful
calm of utter powerlessness. With a dead will, I
would have to drift helplessly to the end !”
He stopped, and wiped the forehead upon which
the grizzled hair had come straggling wildly down.
Nobody else moved. Nobody spoke. The bar-
maid attempted a giggle which became a gasp.
“ I had a pistol in the room,” the man went on,
slowly—“ horribly at hand, and loaded in five
chambers. Coldly—like a man taking up a tooth-
pick I got it out and waited—hopeless and in-
capable of mental initiation—for the bidding of
the inevitable. It came ! ” He leant his elbows on
the counter and dropped his haggard face into his
hands. “It came—at the wrong point of the
cycle! ”
A long groan sounded through the screening
fingers, and then there was silence—broken only
by the striking of eleven. The sound shook the
barmaid together. “ Closing-time ! ” she shrilled,
and the others rose.
Cockerell drank the whisky which had waited
all this time before he said—“ But, look here,
friend —if, as you have left us to infer, you shot
your unfortunate wife, how comes it that you are
at large ? ”
The recounter lifted up his head. There was a
hard smile on his face.
“Because,” he said, “this never happened—to
me ! But it happens, every day, to others. Turn
it well over, my friend, and when—as seems to
be your intention—you inflict yet another medical
psychologist upon the world, you’ll be all the less
likely to contribute to the judicial murder of your
fellow-creatures for doing what they can no more
help than you can help being an—well, I won’t
call you an ass! You are wrong, and your ears
may grow shorter !

His Cippsland

FOR THE BULLETIN
Now, money was scarce and work was slack,
And Love to his heart crept in,
And he rode away on the Northern track
To war with the world and win :
And he vowed by the locket upon his breast
And its treasure, one red-gold curl,
To work with a will in the farthest West
For the sake of his Gippsland girl.
The hot wind blows on the dusty plain,
And the red sun burns above,
But he sees her face at his side again,
And he strikes each blow for love :
He toils by the light of one far-off star
For the winning of one white pearl,
And the swinging pick and the driving bar
Strike home for the Gippsland girl.
With aching wrist and a back that’s bent,
With salt sweat blinding his eyes,
’Tis little he reck if his life were spent
In winning so grand a prize ;
And his shear-blades flash and over his hand
The folds of the white fleece curl,
And all day long he sticks to his stand
For the love of his Gippsland girl.
When the shearing’s done and the sheds “cut out
On Barwon and Narran and Bree;
When the shearer mates with the rouseabout
And the Union man with the “ free ; ”
When the doors of the shanty, open wide,
An uproarious welcome hurl,
He passes by on the other side
For the sake of his Gippsland girl.
When Summer lay brown on the Western Land
He rode once more to the South,
Athirst for the touch of a lily hand
And the kiss of a rose-bud mouth ;
And he sang the songs that shorten the way,
. And he envied not king nor earl,
And he spared not the spur in his dappled grey
For the sake of his Gippsland girl.
And they met him down in the dip below :
“Nellie? She heard you were dead,
Mourned you in black for a year or so—
Now she and Mick Lane are wed.”
He spoke no word ; with a dull, dumb pain
At his heart, and his brain a-whirl,
He turned his grey to the North again
For the sake of nis Gippsland girl.
And he “ rung the board ” in a Paroo shed
By the sweat of his aching brow,
And he “ blued ” his cheque, for he grimly said :
“ There is nothing to live for now.”
And out and away where the big floods start
And the Darling dust-showers swirl,
There’s a drunken shearer that broke his heart
Over a Gippsland girl.

ANIDYL OF PIPECLAY PONDS
[FOR THE BULLETIN]
Talk of the beauties of wedded life
Prom the regular orthodox point of view,
Why, there were the Mullenses, man and wife,
A cosier couple I never knew.
Yet they never were married by parson or priest.
But spliced themselves in the old-time way—
.l umped over the broomstick together—at least
So I’ve many a time heard Mullens say.
Yet, spite of their flimsy marriage-bonds,
They were well respected at Pipeclay Ponds.

HIS OTHER-
SELF
FOR THE BULLETIN
Dr. Margaret Lee was entertaining a few
of her women friends at afternoon tea. Two of
them had been chums of hers at Melbourne Uni-
versity, and had taken degrees in medicine in the
year when, as Margaret Mervyn, her brilliant
success at the examinations had placed its
proudest feather in the hat of Trinity Hostel.
She had married since then, but had kept up the
old college friendship—all the more easily, per-
haps, because she had not to count these two
among her professional rivals. They had never
been able to muster nerve enough to announce
that they were prepared, with drug and scalpel,
to practise upon the bodies of the Public; and,
having been bom with solid silver spoons in their
mouths, had, fortunately, not been driven to do
so by Necessity, which sometimes knows as little
of Medicine as of Law. Her other guests were
later acquaintances and admirers.
There was no suggestion of the New Woman in
the appearance or manner of Dr. Margaret. She
was distinctly, fascinatingly, feminine —a slender,
bright-eyed, red-lipped little lady—and yet ex-
tremely popular with members of her own sex.
This curious anomaly was probably accounted
for by her gift of humor —a quality rarely found
in a very pretty woman, and when so found, and
when it does not make them too uneasy, irresist-
ibl v attractive to other women because of its utter
incomprehensibility.
♦ * *
The conversation was beginning to flag
just a little —Dr. Margaret not being a person who
encouraged earnest discussion on the subject of
chiffons (if that is the right word) —when one of the
Bachelors of Medicine had a happy inspiration.
“Tell us,” she said, addressing her hostess,
“about the very strangest experience you have
had since you began to practise. The whole story,
please—if there is one.”
Dr. Margaret, smiling indulgently, commenced
—“ It was a Man.” Her audience became imme-
diately interested. “I need not describe him
further —it would be a breach of professional
etiquette to do so—than by saying that he was
tall, pale, and dreamy-eyed, and looked like one
who had lost something.”
“ His heart, perhaps,” murmured the other
Bachelor of Medicine, with a sympathetic sigh.
“ Nothing of the kind, Kitty! Something
much more serious, indeed. He began by telling
me that he had heard I was a Theosophist—which
was true enough at the time —and that it was
partly on this account, and partly because I was
young in the profession, and not likely to be, as
yet, a slave to old formulas and musty precedents
(his own words) that he had called to consult me
with regard to his own most singular case. Male
doctors, he said, and especially those of the old
established sort, could not be brought to believe
that anything transcending their own experience,
or the traditions of the profession, had any real
existence. They were, he said, mere gropers in
the dark when asked to deal with a case of a kind
not mentioned in their medical text-books. Of
course I stopped him before he said too much, but
1 must confess that I was not so greatly shocked
by his remarks as I might have been if my pro-
fessional brethren had treated me a little more
generously, when I first beganvto practise.”
Dr. Margaret laughed a tart little laugh, and
continued—“ I asked my strange patient to be
seated and to tell me what his trouble was. ‘ Dr.
Mervyn,’ he said (I was not married then), gazing
earnestly at me with his big black eyes, ‘ do not, I
implore, tell me that my liver is out of order and
that exercise and change of air, with the medicine
you will prescribe, are all I need to cure me. To
say so to a man in my hideous position would be a
piece of cruel irony of which I am sure one so
young and fair could not be capable. ’ The Man
was actually complimentiilgTne,but in such a cold-
blooded, obviously uninterested fashion that I had
no excuse for feeling either flattered or angry. But
I was certainly piqued. Previous men-patients
who had consulted me had been shy and diffident;
this one was perfectly cool and self-possessed.
* Sir, you have not yet told me the symptoms of
your complaint—if any,’ I said; somewhat sharply,
If am afraid. He did not appear to notice this,
however —in fact, he took very little notice of me
at all—but began his story—the queerest, most
extraordinary story I had ever heard. T had
1 tetter give it you in his own words, as nearly as I
can recall them.
“‘ I am,’ said
he, ‘ the victim of
the strangest mis-
fortune that ever
befell a human be-
ing. You see before
you the mere shell
of the man I was a
few short years ago.
The mainspring of
my life on earth is
broken. I am living
in two worlds at the
same time or,
rather, an emanation
from me is living in
the next world, and,’
h e concluded bit-
terly, ‘ carrying on
finely there at the
expense of what is
left of me in this
one. ’
“The Man spoke
coherently, and was
certainly sober.
Moreover, there was
the glitter of insanity
in his eyes, which
were soft and mourn-
ful in expression.
But his remarks
puzzled me. I sup-
pose he saw this, for
he smiled sadly and
observed: ‘You
think I am subject
to delusions ; pos-
sibly that I am a
morbid hypochon-
driac ! Pray don’t !
Nobody could take
more interest in life
than I did until I
found myself in my
present awful posi-
tion. I had—and
still have, when it
can no longer pur-
chase mo a single
pleasure a good
deal of money and
found plenty of en-
joyable ways of spending it. But I became
dissatisfied with the shortsighted day-to-day
life men live on earth, and began to regard
it as of no intrinsic worth, yet, to some ex-
tent, valuable as a preparatory education for the
next stage of existence. It was at this time that
my reading introduced me to the famous Theory
of the Law of Conservation of Energy in the Spiri-
tual World. You know that, according to this
theory, every deed done by a man in this present
stage of being becomes so much stored-up energy,
or capital, awaiting him when he is ready to com-
mence his career in the next stage of being. In
other words, a man at the moment of starting life
in the next world is the sum of his deeds in this
world, plus the motive power, soul, or principle of
continuity, which passes from his earthly body
with its final breath. You follow me, Dr.
Mervyn ?’
“I nodded affirmatively, and said it seemed to
me to be a very sensible theory. He said it was
more—it was a certainty, and one that involved
terrible possibilities. ‘ But what, according to
this doctrine, becomes of a man’s evil deeds ? ’ I
inquired.
“ ‘ They are set against his good ones, and if the
latter preponderate the balance of good is the
capital he has to start upon,’ was the reply.
“ * But if it is the other way about ? ’
“ ‘ Then he begins his new life in debt, to the
extent of the difference.’
“ I asked no more questions.
* * *
“ ‘ I lost no time,’ continued the Man, ‘in
making my conduct square with this new doctrine.
From that day forth my every action was done
with an eye to the increase of my bank-account in
the next stage of existence. I performed pro-
digies of virtue, taking infinite pains to evade
reward for them in this world. No slave of
Mammon could work harder in piling up gold
than I did in piling up good deeds to enable me
to begin my future life as a being of superior
order. And, even as his form of selfishness brings
its inevitable punishment to the slave of Mammon,
so did mine to me.
“ ‘I got into the habit of keeping a diary in
which I entered at night all the virtuous actions I
had performed during the day ; afterwards post-
ing them up in a ledger I had opened for the pur-
pose. I was thus engaged one evening when, all
at once, the feeling came over me that I was not
alone. I looked up and saw, hovering in the dusk
beyond the ring of lamplight, a faintly luminous
human shape, and heard a voice, saying, ‘Put
out the lamp ! ’ I did so, and beheld, shining
wondrously in the darkness, what looked like my
own reflection but highly etherealised just
stepped out of a full-length mirror. The shape
must have observed that I looked nervous, for it
said, with a smile, ‘ Don’t be frightened ! lam
only your other self.’
“ ‘You seem surprised,’ It continued, floating
into an armchair, ‘ yet the thing is very simple
when explained. Bach of your virtuous actions
implied a certain expenditure of vital force. Well,
when a given amount of this vital force had been
accumulated I was evolved—in accordance with
the universal law that life produces life —and I
think you ought to be proud of mb.’ I was, too,
although 1 could see, even then, Dr. Mervyn, that
the creature was odiously conceited. It pleased
me to know that I was able to live in two worlds
at the same time. Alas, how little did I dream
what the privilege would cost! My Other-Self,
after glancing superciliously around the room,
caught sight of the Ixioks at which I had been
working. I explained what they were.
“ ‘ Open a new set,’ It remarked with a laugh.
‘“For what reason ? ’ I inquired.
“‘Because,’lt replied, ‘your hoard of virtue
has vanished.’
“ ‘And how?’ I asked, incredulously.
“ ‘ Well,’ It answered coolly, ‘ a good deal of it
was used up in producing Me, and the remainder
I have spent.’
“ ‘ You’ve what ? ’ I cried aghast.
“ * Spent,’ It repeated, somewhat sullenly— ‘ you
don’t suppose I can live on nothing, do you ? ’
“ I was too disgusted and alsoastounded to reply.
At length, however, I pulled myself together and
observed, scornfully— * Pooh ! you have no objec-
tive existence ! You are only a hallucination ! ’
“‘Am I?’ It remarked drily. I need not tell
you, Dr. Mervyn, what means It used to convince
me that It was a reality. It is sufficient to say
that they were amply effective.
“‘And now,’ said my Other-Self, ‘I shall feel
obliged if you will exert yourself a little more in
doing good. I belong to a rather exclusive set of
Second-Stagers—Other-Selves of great philanthro-
pists, slum-workers, charity-organUesrs, and the
like —and the pace is very hot. Of qqurse, it’s ex-
pensive ; but then the company is very select, and
you would hardly like to know that your Other-
Self looked mean in such society. I shall probably
drop in upon you again before long. ’ And then It
floated out of the room. I burnt my account-
books that night and opened a new set. ”
# # #
“ ‘Since then I have had no peace. My
Other-Self has developed into a merciless tyrant,
and I have become its abject slave. It has plunged
me into the most frightful excesses of virtue —to
such an extent, indeed, that my friends begin to
think lam not sane. Fortunately, I have no rela-
tives. If I had they would certainly try to get an
injunction to restrain me from disposing of my
own property. I have become the prey of beg-
ging-letter writers and mendicants of every des-
cription. They seem to know that I dare not re-
fuse them, and have got into the habit of demand-
ing assistance as a right. On the few occasions
when I have summoned courage enough to rebel
against my thraldom, and have allowed a whole
week to go by without performing a single good
action, my Other-Self has appeared before me look-
ing so haggard and miserable that I have felt
like a criminal for having reduced It to such a
state. At these times It promises, with tears in
its eyes, to reform. But It never reforms. To do
It justice, I don’t think that It means ill. It has
no conscience, because, while I live, It has no
soul. I believe Its conduct to be simply the result
of a natural reaction against too much inherited
goodness. It is a spendthrift because It has not
had to earn what It spends. Nevertheless it
seems strange that such a reckless, irresponsible
being should be the product of an accumulation
of good deeds. The worst of the matter is that I
know that I have to be responsible for It. It is
continually drawing cheques upon me, if I may
use the term in such a connection, in the full con-
fidence that I will honor them. Only the other
night It dragged me out of my bed to prevent a
man in delirium tremens from cutting his throat.
He was a raving lunatic, and strong as seven bulls.
I barely succeeded in escaping from him with my
life, but I managed to divert his attention from
his own throat to mine until the police came and
carried him off to gaol. This good action was
hardly placed to my account in the Next Exist-
ence before it was drawn out by my Other-Self
and squandered. Have I never made an
heroic effort to rid myself of my Tyrant ?
Well, yes. I have tried a course of Vice, but
it was a dismal failure. At the end of it my
Other-Self, instead of coming to me looking
wretched and woe-begone, was simply radiant
with delight. My crimes had been booked to my
credit as virtues of the highest class, noble efforts
of self-sacrifice, because they had been committed
with so much loathing and disgust! So that
attempt to free myself only placed me in a worse
position than ever. Continual yielding on my
part has given my Other-Self such power over me
that now It is really the master and I am its slave.
If something is not done to check its extravagance
I shall have to commence my life in the next world
as a bankrupt. You now know my strange and
unhappy story, Dr. Mervyn.’
* » *
“I might have laughed,” said Dr. Mar-
garet, “though perhapssomewhatartificially, at the
Man’s story, if I had not been a Theosopliist and
believed that such things were possible, and if he
had not been so ternbly in earnest. As it was I
asked him in what way he thought my professional
services could help him, adding, with an amount
of candor which, I consider, was noble in a
struggling young practitioner, that I did not my-
self see how I could do him any good. Then I ven-
tured a little joke and said that if he had brought
his Other-Self with him, and could have induced
it to take some medicine I would have prescribed,
there might have been some .hope of his being
rescued from its tyranny, at least for a time. He
didn’t even smile, but gazed at me half-sadly,
half-severely, and remarked, ‘ Pray don’t do
injustice to your better nature by treating a
tragical subject with flippancy. I have come to
consult you because I feel, somehow, that you may
be able to assist me. What I require is an acces-
sion of vital power—or will-power- to enable me
to overcome the influence of my spiritual parasite.
Does the modern pharmacopoeia contain nothing
corresponding to those herbs known to the ancients
which were said to possess power over spirits ?’ ”
“ I said that if it did I was in ignorance of the
fact. His next remarks almost took my breath
away.
“ ‘ Then you must hypnotise me, ’he said. ‘ There
is no other remedy. And, when I am under the
spell, you must cause me to summon my Other-
Self, and make me disown and defy it, and all its
works. If you will do this I shall have the whip-
hand of it ever after, and, perhaps, know what
happiness means once more. ’ ”
“Of course, I replied that, even if I possessed the
necessary {tower, what he asked me was impossible
from a professional point of view. My rigorously
proper medical brethren would denounce me as a
charlatan, a Madam Mesmer, if they learnt that 1
was working cures by hypnotic suggestion.
“He looked so painfully disappointed that I felt
sorry for him, and said that I thought I could
help him in another way. And so, with some
affectation of mystery as to its ingredients, I
wrote out a prescription, and asked him to call
and let me know the result, after he had finished
the medicine. It was simply a strong nerve-tonic,
but described in a' kind of abbreviated doctor’s
latin, intelligible only to myself and my own
special chemist.
“You must assist the action of the drugs,” I
added, “by endeavouring to occupy your mind
with some subject which will make a strong
demand upon your attention—Browning’s ‘ Ring
and the Book,’ for instance.”
“He promised to obey my instructions implicitly
■* * *
“My curious patient paid me a second visit
about a week afterwards, looking paler and thinner
than ever. He said that he thought the medicine
had done him good, but “ The Ring and the Book, ”
which he had set himself seriously to understand,
had been too much for him. But he believed that
his Other-Self had lost a little of its power over
him. It had called upon him twice only during
the week, and he had had only one Orgy of Vir-
tue. I told him to keep to the medicine, and not
worry any more over “ The Ring and the Book,”
and he went away kicking comparatively cheerful.
“After this his calls became more frequent, and 1
noticed that he looked brighter and better on
each occasion, and had taken to wearing flowers
in his button-hole. But a gradual change in his
manner kept pace with this change in his appear-
ance. From being cool and self-possessed he
became nervous and shy. One day he called, and,
after talking on half-a-dozen subjects, went away
without saying a word about his malady. Then I
knew that ne was cured. I was rather soi’ry to
lose him as a patient. I had become quite inter-
ested in his case. That,” concluded Dr. Mar-
garet, “ is the story of my strangest experience as
a doctor. ”
“ But surely that isn’t all of the story ? ”
said one of the Bachelors of Medicine.
“ What became of the poor man’s Other-Self ? ”
the other Bachelor inquired.
“ You had better ask him ! Here he comes,
said Dr. Margaret.
Listening, they heard the sound of steps upon
the stairs and a voice singing in a rich, rolling bari-
tone the stave of “ Autolycus ”:
Jog on, jog on, the footpath-way,
And merrily hent the stile-a :
A merry heart goes all the (lay,
Your sad tires in a mile-a.
There was a chorus of exclamations. “You little
traitor ! you have been telling us about your hus-
band all the time.”
“Yes, dears. I married my patient. lie
doesn’t appear to be much worried about his
Other-Self now, docs he ?”
“No, indeed,” remarked Bachelor Kitty, “you
have given him a new interest in life.”
“ Yes,” replied Dr. Margaret dryly, “ and a new
commandment THOU SHALT HAVE NO
OTHER-SELF BUT ME.”

My Neighbor.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My neighbor’s hat is black and tall.
How bright its silken sheen !
Compared with his, my home is small
And altogether mean ;
The hand he puts in mine oft-times
He does not care to soil,
And yet I praise in simple rhymes
The dignity of toil.
My neighbor’s buggy bears me out
For cool and pleasant drives,
He seldom lets me “ do a shout ”
When ’freshment time arrives.
He laughs with glee at all my quips ;
No nasty, pompous smirks,
But kindly smiles play round his lips
Although he never works.
My other neighbor is a smith ;
From early morn till e’en’
He earns an honest living with
Two horny paws unclean,
His adjectives are warm enough
To make a kettle boil,
Whilst he upholds, in accents gruff,
The dignity of toil.
My other neighbor has a ’eart
And soul within his breast;
A shilling he will gladly part
To help a mate distressed,
But as I do not want for food
And seem from trouble free,
He often growls: ‘ ‘ Twould do ’im good
To have to graft like me.”
Which is my neighbor of the pair ?
The smith, by fate denied
Those pleasures which 'tis sweet to share
With Jones? 1 can’t decide.
One man’s a credit to the soil.
The other toff’s a sloth
Who comes to me with corn and oil.
Which is my neighbor ? Both.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was tired of the myrtle forest,
And sick of the waratah—
That gleams in the lonely places,
And shines like a splendid star.
And the sound of the jay-birds calling
To a wearisome chant had grown—
For the voice of the bush is dreary,
And sad its dominant tone.
And ever, as time went slowly,
The longing became more keen
For a spell in the open country,
And a change to another scene.
So it came to pass ere the daylight
Had crept to the old bark nut,
That his swag was rolled for the journey,
And the door of his house was shut.
But whether he journeyed eastward —
Or whether he wandered west—
Is known to the bush-birds only,
And the angel that gave him rest.
And the place of his final resting
Shall a riddle remain unread,
Until, like the sea we read of —
The bush sh ill give up her dead !

"BEFORE WE COT THE DEEDS"
Cub selection adjoined a sTreep-run on the
Darling Downs, and boasted of few and scant im-
provements. A verandahless four-roomed slab-
hut standing out from a forest of box-trees, a
stock-yard, and six acres under barley were the
only evidence of settlement. A few horses—not
ours —sometimes grazed about, and occasionally a
mob of cattle—also not ours—cows with young
calves, steers, and an old bull or two, would stroll
around, chew the best legs of any trousers that
might be hanging on the log reserved as a clothes-
line, then leave in the night and be seen no more
for months —some of them never.
And yet we were always out of meat!
Dad was up the country earning a few pounds—
the corn drove him up. It didn’t bring what he
expected ; all we got out of it was a bag of flour—
I don’t know what the storekeeper got. Before
he left we put in the barley. Somehow, Dad
didn’t believe in sowing any more crops, he seemed
to lose heart; but Mother talked it over with him,
and when reminded that he soon would be en-
titled to the deeds he brightened up again and
worked. How he worked !
We had no plough, so old Anderson turned over
the six acres for us, and Dad gave him a pound an
acre—at least he was to send him the first six
pounds got up country. Dad sowed the seed ;
then he, Dan, and Dave yoked themselves to
a large dry bramble each and harrowed it in.
From the way they sweated it must have been
hard work. Sometimes they would sit down in
the middle of the paddock and “ spell,” but Dad
would say something about getting the deeds and
they’d start again.
A cockatoo-fence was round the barley ; and
wire-posts, a long distance apart, round tho grass-
paddock. We were to get wire to put in when
Dad sent the money; and apply for the deeds
when he came back. Things would be different
then, according to Dad, and the farm would be
worked properly. We would break up 50 acres,
build a barn, buy a reaper, ploughs, cornsheller,
get cows and good horses, and start two or three
ploughs. Meanwhile, if we (Dan, Dave and I)
minded the barley he was sure there’d be some-
thing got out of it.
« * *
Dad was now away about six weeks.
Travellers were passing by every day, and
there wasn’t one th a
didn’t want a little o.
something or other.
Mother used to ask them
if they had met Dad ?
None ever did until an
old grey man came along
and said he knew Dad
well—he had camped with
him one night and shared
a damper.' Mother was
very pleased and brought
him in. We had a kan-
garoo.-rat (stewed) for din-
ner that day. The girls
didn’t want to lay it on
the table at first, but
Mother said he wouldn’t
know what it was. The
traveller was very hungry
and liked it, and when
passing his plate the
second time for more, said
it wasn’t often that he got
any poultry.
He tramped on again,
and the girls were very
glad he didn’t know it
was a rat. But Dave
wasn’t so sure that he
didn’t know a rat from
a rooster, and reckoned he
hadn’t met Dad at all.
* * *
Tho seventh week
Dad came back. He
arrived at night, and the
lot of us had to get up to
find the hammer to knock
the peg out of the door
and let him in. He
Drought home <£ —no*
enough to get the wire w . ’ *ut he also brought
ahorse and saddle. He didn’t say if he bought
them. It was a bay mare, a grand animal for a
journey—so Dad said —and only wanted condi-
tion. Emelina, he called her. No mistake she
was a quiet mare. We put her where there was
good feed, but she wasn’t one that fattened on
grass. Birds took kindly to her—crows mostly
-and she. couldn’t go anywhere but a flock of
them accompanied her. Even when Dad used to
ride her (Dan or Dave never rode her) they used
to follow, and would fly on ahead to wait in a
tree and “caw ” when he was passing beneath.
* * *
One morning when Dan was digging
potatoes for dinner—splendid potatoes they were,
too, Dad said ; he had only once tasted sweeter
ones, but they were grown in a cemetery—he
found the kangaroos had been in the barley. We
knew what that meant, and that night made fires
round it, thinking to frighten them off, but didn’t
—mobs of them were in at daybreak. Dad
swore from the house at them, but they took no
notice ; and when he ran down, they just hopped
over the fence and sat looking at him. Poor Dad !
I don’t know if he was knocked up or if he didn t
know any more, but he stopped swearing and sat
on a stump looking at a patch of barley they had
destroyed, and shaking his head. Perhaps he was
thinking if he only had a dog ! We did have one
until he got a bait. Old Spring ! He was lying
under the table at supper-time when he took the
first fit, and what a- fright we got! He must have
reared before stiffening out, because he capsized
the table into Mother’s lap, and everything on it
smashed except the tin-plates and the pints. I he
lamp fell on Dad, too, and the melted fat scalded
his arm. Dad dragged
Bpring out and cut
off his tail and ears,
but he might as well
have taken off Ins
head.
« * *
Dad stood with
his back to the fire
and Mother was nut-
ting a stitch in his
trousers. “There’s
nothing for it but
to watch them at
n ight, ” he was say ’; ig,
when old And r. on
appeared and a ked
“if he could have
those few pounds.”
Dad asked Mother if
she had any money
in the house ? Of
course she hadn’t.
Then he told Ander-
son he would let him
have it when he got
the deeds. Anderson
’eft, and Dad sat on
the edge of the sofa auJ seemed to be count
ing the grains on a corn-cob that he lifted from the
floor, while Mother sat looking at a kangaroo-tail
on the table and didn’t notice the cat drag it off.
At last Dad said, “Ah, well!—it won’t be long
now, Ellen, before we have the deeds !”
* * *
We now took it in turns to watch the
barley. Dan and the two girls the first half,
and Dad, Dave and 1 the second. Dad
always slept in his clothes, and he used
to think some nights that the others came in
before time. It was terrible going out, half-
awake, to tramp round that paddock from fire to
fire and from hour to hour, shouting and yelling.
And how we used to long for daybreak ! When-
ever we sat down quietly together for a few
minutes we would hear the dull thud ! thud ! thud!
—the kangaroo’s footstep.
We each carried a kerosene-tin at last, slung
like a kettledrum, and belted it with a waddy—■
Dad’s idea. He himself manipulated an old bell
that he had found on a bullock’s grave, and made
a splendid noise with it.
It was a hard struggle, but we succeeded in
saving the bulk of the barley, and cut it down
with a scythe and three reaping-hooks. The girls
helped to bind it, and Jimmy Mulcahy carted it
in return for three days’ binding Dad put in for
him. The stack wasn’t built 24 hours when a
score of somebody’s crawling cattle ate their way up
to their tails into it. We took the hint and pu ta
sapling fence round it.
* * *
Again Dad decided to go up country for
a while. He caught Emelina after breakfast,
rolled up a blanket, told us to watch the stack,
and started.
The crows followed.
We were having dinner. Dave said, “ Listen.”
We listened, and it seemed as though all the
crows and other feathered demons of the wide
bush were engaged in a mighty scrimmage.
“Dad’s back,” Dan said, and rushed out in the
ato A jp 3 B<>
lead of a stampede.
Emelina was back, anyway, with the swag on,
but Dad wasn’t. We caught her, and Dave
pointed to white spots all over the saddle, and
said —“ Hanged if they haven’t been ridin’ her! ”
meaning the crows.
Mother got anxious, and sent Dan to see what
had happened. Dan found Dad, with his shirt
off, at a pub. on the main road, wanting to fight
the pubhoan for a hundred pounds, but couldn’t
fiersuade him to come home. Two men brought him
mme that night on a sheep-hurdle, and he gave
up the idea of going away.
After all, the barley turned out well—
there was a good price that year, and we were
able to run two wires round the paddock.
One day a bulky Govt, letter came—Dad looked
surprised and pleased, and how his hand trembled
as he broke the seal! “ The Deeds !”he said, and
all of us gathered round to look at them. Dave
thought they were like the inside of a bear-skin
covered with writing.
Dad said he would ride to town at once, and
went for Emelina.
“Couldn’t y’ find her, Dad?” Dan said, seeing
him return without the mare.
Dad cleared his throat, but didn’t answer.
Mother asked him.
“ Yes, 1 found her,” he said, slowly, “dead."
The crows had got her at last.
He wrapped the deeds in a piece of rag and
walked.
There was nothing, scarcely, that he didn’t send
out from town, and Jimmy Mulcahy and old
Anderson have many and many times since then
borrowed our dray.
Now Dad regularly curses the deeds every
mail-day, and wishes to Heaven he had never got
them.

If poor Tom Moore could rise, I’m sure, though
dust and Death enfold him,
His shade ’twould cheer to find how dear all Irish-
men yet hold him,
W h it grief still flows o’er Tom’s ‘ ‘ Last Rose ” and
whisky by the gallon
Doth drench in joy his “ Minstrel Boy ” and flood
“ Sweet Innisfallen !”
Oh ! when they meet in camp or street, fair Erin’s
sons and daughters,
There, too, will be in grief or glee, a “ Meeting of
the Waters.”
So Hogan drew the rein and threw the saddle
from Gay Lady,
Then midst the clans stood wringing hands of
Burke, Malone, and Brady,
i A “stirrup-cup” they filled him up of stout
potheen and fiery,
Ere he might loose his tongue to news or answer
one enquiry.
They piled a plate with spuds and “mate,” and
sate him by the table,
Whilst Missus Shea brewed “ pot o’ tay ”as strong
as ocean cable,
And need I tell that Hogan fell upon the fare
they bore him,
That “mate” and spuds with dull, dead thuds
went quickly down before him ?
“I’m late,” said he, “for Mass, you see” —(his
brows here bent together)—
“ Thim roads, bedad, is worse nor bad beyant
since last wet weather,
But, by the post, what kep’ me most ” —(again he
scowled like thunder) —
“My brindled cow is shtole 1 . . I vow by all
above and undher
That if Oi can Oi’ll lay the man that’s got the
bate in pickle,
And whe iOi ketcl. 1 1 ■ tarnal wretch his hide, by
troth, Oi’ll tickle ! ’
Kight just his cause, and loud applause met
Hogan’s peroration,
Tor each believed —as each had thieved from each
of stock and station.
In those old days the bush had ways, peculiar
from our standing—
That they should take who could and fake (when-
e’er ’twas safe) the branding.
You stole my beast? Well, west or east next
night I’d ride to “ borrow ”
A beast in lieu of that I knew you’d salted ere the
morrow.
’Twas all fair play, by night and day each “ pil-
fered ” from the other,
And sire from son his mob would run, and
brother stole from brother.
Thus Hogan told his tale and rolled great oaths
about the brindle,
And ate and swore and told it o’er .vhat time the
food did dwindle ;
He drank and ate ! “ Tis tindher mate,” and,
Mrs. Shea, Oi’m grateful
Tor such a feed. Aye, faix ! Indeed, Oi’ll take
another plateful.
Don’t shtop the fun ye’ve just begun ; kapeup the
choone there, Denny !
Malone ! Whurroo ! Good luck to you—meself,
Oi don’t get any ! ”
Now, Mrs. Shea, alas to say, though kinder hand
ne’er fed one,
By some hard fate got on his pi tte a white hair
and a red one I
Which Hogan saw, and straight his jaw dropped
like a dying fish’s
While fork and knife in his soul’s strife went
clatt’nng ’midst the dishes.
Tor quick as thought those hairs had brought unto
his mind a notion
That in his breast (almost at rest) made manifest
commotion.
“ ’Tis Daisy’s hide,’ at length he cried, tobearthe
strain unable ;
And as he spoke the plate he broke in splinters on
the table —•
“ Oi’d know the hair, though sarved up there, of
her that Oi did cherish,
Oi’ll sarch,” he swore, as out he tore, “}o r stack
of hides or perish ! ! ”
Alas for Shea, what could he say when high o’er-
head ’twas flourished
The brand cut out but not a doubt the hide that
Hogan “ nourished ? ”
In truth to tell the fearsome yell emitted by the
latter
Tor some slight space paled Shea’s red face and
stilled the growing clatter.
“Ye Orange thief!” he roared with grief and
savage Celtic passion,
And added to the words a few choice epithets in
fashion—
“ Oi’ll see ye hung !” Thereat he flung the hide
in Shea’s broad features.
“ Take that from me, ’tis fit for ye who robs his
fellow creatures !”
They fought in pairs with legs of chairs and sticks
and odds and ends there,
And each fresh blow marked one more foe ’midst
those who had been friends there ;
Engaged all round in open ground, a fence-rail ftr
shillelah,
Not oft you’d see a fight as free nor one that went
so gaily.
Why, Mick Malone broke Burke’s skull-bone first
crack and laid him gasping,
But with the same a stirrup came on Mick’s own
headpiece rasping ;
Then Pat O’Nale got more fence-rail than he had
strength to carry;
And Thady Kane tried all in vain a pitchfork
thrust to parry.
Just when ’twas done a scarlet sun went down
great clouds of red in,
Where Hogan got the Sheas’ big pot to beat its
owner’s head in.
Then, as the night closed up that fight our hero
bold rode through it,
His saddle wet (but not with sweat), and Daisy's
hide strapped to it I
Now as they ride across the wide, rough table-
lands and ranges,
Where bushman brown from up and down with
bushman yarns exchanges ;
Trom Braidwood side to Lachlan - tide, from
Bathurst to the Bogan,
They never fail to tell the tale of that famed fight
and Hogan.
Go where you will o’er plain and hill, by farm and
far selection,
They don’t forget, it lingers yet, a pleasant recol-
lection.
Aye ! where clear creeks from blue hill peaks flow
down thro’ fields of clover,
Each sttmmer day amongst the hay their children
play it over !

Christie Murray in the London Contemporary Review.
That is true. The universality of The Bulletin’s circula-
tion in Australasia is the envy of all other papers. In and
beyond Australia, Tub Bulletin, now in'its fourteenth
year of issue, is the most popular, best-known, best-
quoted, and most widely and numerously circulated of all

THE MERINO SHEEP
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The prosperity of Australia is absolutely
based on a beast —the merino sheep. If all the
sheep in the country were to die, the big banks
would collapse like card houses, the squatting
securities, which are their backbone, being gone.
Business would perish, and the money we owe
to England would be as hopelessly lost to that'
nation as if we were a South American state.
The sheep, and the sheep alone, keeps us going.
On the back of this beneficent creature we all live.
Knowing this, people have got the impression that
the merino sheep is a gentle, bleating animal that
gets its living without trouble to anybody, and
comes up every year to be shorn with a pleased
smile upon its amiable face. It is my purpose here,
as one having experience, to exhibit the merino
sheep in its true light, so that the public may
know wluvt kind of brute they are depending on.
• * #
And first let us give him what little
credit is his due. No one can accuse him
of being a ferocious animal. No one could
ever say that a sheep attacked him without
provocation ; though there is an old bush story of
a man who was discovered in the act of killing a
neighbour’s wether. “Hallo!” said the neigh-
bour. “What’s this? Killing my sheep ! What
have you got to say for yourself ?’’ “ Yes,” said
the man, with an air of virtuous indignation. “ I
am killing your sheep. I’ll kill any man’s sheep
that bites me !” But as a rule the merino refrains
from using his teeth on people, and goes to work
in another way.
* # *
The truth is that the merino sheep is a
dangerous monomaniac, and his one idea is—to
ruin the man who owns him. With this object in
view he will display a talent for getting into
trouble and a genius for dying that are
almost incredible. If a mob of sheep see
a bush fire closing round them, do they run
away out of danger? Not at all; they rush
round and round in a ring till the fire burns them
up. If they are in a river-bed, with a howling
flood coming down, they will stubbornly refuse to
cross three indies of water to save them-
selves. Dogs and men may bark and shriek,
but the sheep won’t move. They will wait there
till the flood comes and drowns them all, and then
their corpses go down the river on their backs with
their feet in the air. A mob of sheep will crawl
along a road slowly enough to exasperate a snail,
but let a lamb get away from the mob in a bit of
rough country, and a racehorse can’t head him
back again. If sheep are put into a big paddock
with water in three corners of it, they will reso-
lutely crowd into the fourth corner and die of
thirst. When sheep are being counted out at a
gate, if a scrap of bark be left on the ground in
the gateway, they will refuse to step over it until
dogs and men have sweated and toiled and sworn
and “heeled ’em up,” and “spoke to ’em,” and
fairly jammed them at it. Then the first one will
gather courage, rush at the fancied obstacle, spring
over it about six feet in the air, and dart away.
The next does exactly the same, but jumps a bit
higher. Then comes a rush of them following one
another in wild bounds like antelopes, until one
“over-jumps himself” and alights on his head—a
performance which nothing but a sheep could
compass. This frightens those still in the yard,
and they stop running out, and the dogging and
shrieking and hustling and tearing have to be gone
through all over again. This on a red-hot day, mind
you, with clouds of blinding dust about, with the
yolk of wool irritating your eyes, and with, perhaps,
three or four thousand sheep to put through.
The delay throws out the man who is counting,
and he forgets whether he left off at 45 or 95.
The dogs, meanwhile, take the first chance to slip
over the fence and hide in the shade somewhere.
Then there are loud whistlings and oaths, and calls
for Rover and Bluey, and at last a dirt-begrimed
man jumpsover the fence, unearths a dog and hauls
him back to work by the ear. The dog sets to
barking and heeling-’em-up again, and pretends
that he thoroughly enjoys it, but he is looking
out all the time for another chance to “clear.”
And this time lie won’t be discovered in a hurry.
# # #
To return to our muttons. There is a
well-authenticated story of a shipload of sheep
being lost once, because an old ram jumped over-
board into the ocean, and all the rest followed
him. No doubt they did, and were proud to do it. A
sheep won’t go through an open gate on his own
responsibility, but he would gladly and proudly
follow another sheep through the red-hot portals
of Hades : and it makes no difference whether
the leader goes voluntarily, oris hauled struggling
and kicking and fighting every inch of the way.
For pure, sodden stupidity there is no animal like
the merino sheep. A lamb will follow a bullock-
dray drawn by 16 bullocks and driven by a pro-
fane “colonial” with a whip, under the impression
that this aggregate monstrosity is his mother. A
ewe never knows her own lamb by sight, and
apparently has no sense of colour. She can
recognise her own lamb's voice half a mile off
among a thousand other voices apparently exactly
similar; bub when she gets within five yards of
her lamb she starts to smell all the lambs in reach,
including the black ones, though her own may be
a white lamb. The fiendish resemblance which
one sheep bears to another is a great advantage to
them in their struggles with their owners. It
makes them more difficult to draft out of a strange
flock, and much harder to tell when any are
missing.
Concerning this resemblance between sheep,
there is a story told of a fab old Murrum-
bidgee squatter who gave a big price for a
famous ram called, say, Sir Oliver. He took
a friend out one day to inspect Sir Oliver,
and overhauled that animal with a most impressive
air of sheep-wisdom. “Look here,” he said, “atthe
fineness of the wool. See the serrations in each
thread of it. See the density of it. Look at the
way his legs and belly are clothed—-he’s wool all
over, that sheep. Grand animal, grand animal!”
Then they went and had a drink, and the old
squatter said, “Now, I’ll show you the difference
between a champion ram and a second-rater.” So
he caught a ram and pointed out his defects.
“ See here—not half the serrations that other
sheep had. No density of fleece to speak of.
Bare-bellied as a pig, compared with Sir Oliver.
Not that this isn’t a fair sheep, bub he’d be dear
at one-tenth Sir Oliver’s price. By the way,
Johnson” (to his overseer, “what ram is this?”
“ That, sir,” replied the astounded functionary—
-11 that’s Sir Oliver, sir !” And so it was.
• # •
There is another kind of sheep in Aus-
tralia, as great a curse in his own way as the
merino—namely, the cross-bred or half-merino-
half-Leicester animal. The cross-bred will get
through, under, or over any fence you like to pub
in front of him. He is never satisfied on his
owner’s run, but always thinks other people’s runs
must be better, so he sets off to explore. He
will strike a course, say, south-east, and so long
as the fit takes him he will keep going south-east
through all obstacles, rivers, fences, growing crops
anything. The merino relies on passive resist-
ance for his success; the cross-bred carries the
war into the enemy’s camp, and becomes a living
curse to his owner day and night. Once there was
a man who was induced in a weak moment to
buy 20 cross-bred rams, and from that hour
the hand of Fate was upon him. They gob
into all the paddocks they shouldn’t have been
in. They scattered themselves all over the
run promiscuously. They got into the cultivation-
paddock and the vegetable-garden at their own sweet
will. And then they took to roving. In a body
they visited the neighbouring stations, and played
havoc with the sheep all over the district. The
wretched owner was constantly getting fiery
letters from his neighbours : “ Your rams
are here. Come and take them away at
once,” and he would have to go off nine or ten
miles to drive them home. Any man who
has tried to drive rams on a hot day knows what
purgatory is. He was threatened with actions for
trespass for scores of pounds damages every
week. He tried shutting them up in the sheep-
yard. They got out and went back to the garden.
Then he gaoled them in the calf-pen. Out again
and into a growing crop. Then he set a boy to
watch them, but the boy went to sleep, and they
were four miles away across country before he got
on to their tracks. At length, when they
happened accidentally to be at home on their
owner’s run there came a huge flood. His sheep
mostly merinoes, bad plenty of time to get on to
high ground and save their lives, but, of course,
they didn’t, and they were almost all drowned.
The owner sat on a rise above the waste of waters
and watched the dead animals go by. He was
a ruined man. His hopes in life were gone.
But he said, “Thank God, those rams are drowned,
anyhow.” Just as he spoke there was a splashing
in the water, and the twenty rams solemnly swam
ashore and ranged themselves in front of him.
They were the only survivors of thousands of
sheep. He broke down utterly, and was taken to
an asylum for insane paupers. The cross-breds had
fulfilled iheir destiny.
*' * #
The cross-bred drives his owner out of his
mind, but the merino ruins his man with greater
celerity. Nothing on earth will kill cross-breds,
while nothing will keep merinoes alive. If they
are put on dry saltbush country they die of
drought. If they are put on damp, well-watered
country they die of worms, fluke, and foot-rot.
They die in the wet seasons and they die in the
dry ones. The hard, resentful look which you
may notice on the faces of all bushmen comes
from a long course of dealing with the merino
sheep. It is the merino sheep which dominates
the bush, and which gives to Australian literature
its melancholy tinge, and its despairing pathos.
The poems about dying boundary-riders, and
lonely graves under mournful she-oaks, are the
direct outcome of the authors’ too close association
with that soul-destroying animal, the merino
sheep. A man who could write anything cheerful
after a day in the drafting-yards would be a freak
of nature.
THE BANJO.
Know Thyself.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The of old spake words of truth,
And yet his golden speech untimely ended.
For when he wisely told each maid and youth
“ Go, know thyself! ” he might have haply
blended
That wise instruction with imperious order
To secret keep their characters’ cracked delf.
For man should give the news to no recorder,
But know himself and keep it to himself.
RANDOLPH BEDFOKD
TWO OCENA
TRAMPS
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I was listening to those charming musicians, the
convict band, playing in Noumea, and saw in the
crowd a man I knew—more, an old friend, S .
The recognition was mutual and pleasing to both.
We had not met for six years. He was then chief
officer of a China steamer; now he was captain of
a big tramp steamer that had called in to load
nickel ore. “Who,” I exclaimed, “would ever
have thought of meeting you here ?”
He laughed and replied : “1 came with a pur-
pose. You remember Miss ,to whom I was
engaged in Sydney ?”
I nodded, expecting from the sparkle in his
dark brown eye that I was going to hear a little
gush about her many wifely qualities.
“ Well, I was in Sydney three times after I saw
you. We were to be married as soon as I got a
command. Two years ago I was there last. She
had got married. Yes, wrote me a letter saying
she knew my calmer judgment would finally
triumph over my anger—she had accepted a good
offer, and although I might be nettled, perhaps, at
first, yet she was sure my good sense would
applaud her decision in marrying a man who,
although she could never love him as she loved
me, was very rich. But she would always look
forward to meeting me again. That was all.”
“ Hard lines,” I said.
“ My dear boy, I thought that at first, when her
letter knocked me flat aback. But I got over it
and I swore I would pay her out. And I came to
this den of convicts to do it, and I did it—yester-
day. She is here.”
“Here?” I said.
So, then, I learnt the rest of Captain S ’s
story. A year after his lady-love had jilted him
ho received a letter from her in England. She
was in sad trouble, she said. Her husband, a
Victorian official, was serving five years for em-
bezzlement. Her letter was suggestive of a desire
to hasten to the “protection ” of her sailor lover.
She wished, she said, that her husband were dead.
But dead or alive she would always hate him.
S merely acknowledged her letter and sent
her £25. In another six months he got a letter
from Fiji. She was a governess there, she said, at
£75 a year. Much
contrition and love,
also, in this letter.
S sent another
£25, and remarked
that he would see
her soon. Fate one
day sent him to take
command ofa steamer
in Calcutta bound to
Fiji with coolies,
thence to Noumea to
load nickel ore. And
all the way out across
the tropics S ’s
heart was leaping at
the thought of seeing
his lost love—and
telling her that he
hated her for her
black, frozen trea-
chery.
As soon as he had
landed his coolies he
set about locating
the family with whom
she lived. No one
knew them, but a
planter explained
matters: “I know
the lady for whom
you enquire, but she
doesn’t go by that
name. Ask anyone
about Miss , the
barmaid. She has
gone to New Cale-
donia.”
He asked, and
learned that she was
well - known ; and
S wondered why
she had brought her
beauty to such a
climate as that of
Fiji when it would
have paid iier so much
better to parade it in
Melbourne.
The evening of the day on which his steamer
arrived at Noumea a man brought him a letter.
He showed it to me ;
My darling Will. Thank God you have come, lor
surely you have come for me—my heart tells me so. For
God’s sake wait on board for me. I will come at eight.
To live in this place is breaking my heart. Ever yours,
She came. He stood her kisses passively but
gave none in return, until she asked him to kiss
her. “ When you are my wife,” he said evasively.
And then—l believe she must have loved him—
she burst out into passionate sobs as she fell at his
feet in the quiet cabin, and told him of her debased
life in Fiji. “ But, as God hears me, Will, that
is all past since your last letter. I was mad. I
loved money and did not care how I got it. I left
Fiji to come here, intending to return to Aus-
tralia. But, Will, dear Will, if it is only to throw
me overboard, take me away from this hell upon
earth. For your sake, Will, I have resisted them
here, although I suffer daily, hourly, torture and
insult. I have no money and lam afraid to die
and end my sufferings.”
Captain S , speaking calmly and slowly,
placed money in her hand and said, “You must
not see me again till the day I am ready for sea.
Then bring your luggage and come on board.”
With a smothered sob bursting from her, despite
the joy in her heart, the woman turned and left
him. Then S went up to the oaf 6 Palais and
played billiards with a steady hand.
There was a great number of people on board to
see Captain S—— away. Presently a boat came
alongside, and a young lady with sweet red lips
and shiny hair ascended to the deck.
“Ho, ho 1” said a French officer to S , “ and
so you are taking away the fair one who won’t
look at us poor exiles of Nouvelle.”
With a timid smile and fast-beating heart the
woman gained the quarter-deck. In front of her
stood the broad-shouldered Captain S , cold,
impassive, and deadly pale, with a cruel joy in
his breast.
The woman stood still. There was something
so appalling in that set white face before her that
her slight frame quivered with an unknown dread.
And then the Captain spoke, in slow, measured
words that cut her to her inmost soul.
“ Madam, I do not take passengers !”
No answer. Only short, gasping breaths as she
steadied her hand on the rail.
And then, turning to one of the Frenchmen :
“M. , will you request this—t- is lady to go on
shore ? She is known to me as a woman of in-
famous reputation in Fiji. I cannot for a moment
entertain the idea of having such a person on
board my ship.”
Before the shuddering creature fell a man caught
her, and then she was placed in the boat and taken
ashore. Of course some of the Frenchmen
thought it right to demand an explanation from
S , who said :
“ I’ve none to give, gentlemen. If any of you
want to fight me, well and good, although I don’t
like quarrelling over a pavement-woman. Besides,
I rather think you’ll find that the lady will now be
quite an acquisition to you.”
But S ’s revenge was not complete. He had
previously arranged matters with his engineer,
who presently came along and announced an acci-
dent to the machinery—the steamer would b"
delayed a couple of days. You see, S wanted
to see her again—as he told me.
“It was a cruel thing,” I said.
A THRIFT ITEM.
Weary foot-traveller (who has heard of the Squatter’s meanness) goes
right up to the homestead, kneels down and pretends to be grazing.
SQUATTER : “Hi! What are you doin’?”
TRAVELLER (sure that he’s about to be invited round to the men's hut):
“Havin’ a feed—of grass.”
SQUATTER: “Try the next paddock. You’ll find the grass there ever
so much longer.”
“Bah!” saidS , “ come with me.”
In the crowded bar of the a woman was
laughing and talking gaily. Something made her
look up. She put her hand to her eyes and fell,
As we walked slowly down to the wharf the

Messrs. Henry R. Worthington’s Works at
Brooklyn, New York, with the foundry at Eliza-
beth Port,Ne w Jersey—the largest of the world’s hy-
draulic works exclusively manufacturing pumping
machinery—employ 2000 men and turn out 30 to 40
pumps daily ; 10,000 to 12,000 yearly. The out-
put up to January, ’95, was 85,000, and the regular
stock exceeds 2000. The firm’s branch offices and
agencies are established in every worthy trade
centre of civilisation. Those outside the United
States are controlled by the Worthington Engine
Company of Queen Victoria-st., London, E.C. —
the big European and colonial branch company of
the great American firm.
• # *
In 1884, the eminent engineering firm, Messrs.
James Simpson and Co., Ltd., Grosvenor-road,
London, arranged with Messrs. Henry R. Worth-
ington to take up the manufacture of the larger-
sized Worthington engines. This fact is the
strongest testimony to the correctness of the
Worthington system of pumping. For Messrs.
Simpson and Co. are a century old, and have
devoted themselves so largely to the manufacture
of pumping engines that they always stood as the
leading English firm for this class of manufacture.
Their famous
type, the Com-
pound Rotative
Beam Bucket and
Plunger Pumping
Engine is known
world-wide as the
Simpson En-
gine, nevertheless they abandoned their own type
and adopted the superior Worthington.

Both the European and Colonial Branch Com-
pany of Messrs. Henry R. Worthington and
James Simpson and Co., Limited, are represented
in Australia by the Worthington Pumping Engine
Co.’s Head Australian Branch at 32 Clarence-
street, Sydney, and by this branch’s agencies in
all the other colonies. All these display a large
and splendid stock comprising every variety and
capacity of pumps, delivering from 200 gallons to
45,000 gallons hourly, and suitable for heads of
from 50 feet to 700 feet.
• • •
In the United States Messrs. Henry R Worth-
ington have equipped over 1000 cities with water-
works pumping machinery. The greater portion
of the crude oil which comes through many miles
of pipes in America is pumped by Worthington
Engines, for they work so smoothly and steadily
that engines of 400 h.p., working against a
pressure of 18001 b. per square
inch, can be employed without
bursting the mains.

At the Chicago Exhibition the
Worthington Engines presented
the most striking exhibit of
pumping machinery ever seen,
and pumped 70.000,000 gallons
every 24 hours. This grand ex-
hibit represented £40,000.

In England, Europe, Asia, and
Africa Messrs. Simpson and Co.
have supplied Worthington
Engines with magnificent success.
Seventy per cent, of London’s im-
mense water-supply is handled by
Worthington Engines, and the
Worthington Engines at the
County Council Sewage Pumping
Stations, Abbey Mills, put
through 18,000,000 gallons of
sewage daily. At Rotterdam
large Worthington Engines are
e nployed on the sewage, and

of 12,000,000 and 8,000,000 gallons per day
respectively. The Board certifies that they
perform their work economically and most satis-
factorily. These Crown-st. engines are well-worth
inspecting, because they are the largest installation
of pumping machinery in the Southern Hemis-
phere.
A large compound pressure pump has recently
been supplied to the Sydney
Stevedoring and Wool Dump-
ing Co. at Moore’s wharf. This
pump is working against a
pressure of over 8001 b. on the
sq. inch, and performs its duties
with remarkable satisfaction.
A similar type of pump has
lately been sent to two Queens-
land mines to drain shafts 800
feet deep, doing the work in
one lift. Different contractors
on the Melbourne Sewage
Works express great satisfac-
tion at the performance of the
Worthington Pumps used in
draining different shafts ; two
Worthington pressure pumps are
used to force the Greathead
shields forward in the tunnels
of one contract, “Pumping
against a pressure of up to
25001 b. to sq. inch through
feed pipes nearly 2000 feet
long.'’ The Shepparton-Urban
Water Works Trust consider
that the Worthington Pumpsare
superior to all other types
which they have tried; they
pump double the quantity
another engine did and use
one-half the fuel. The Mayor
of Balranald says : “The Wor-
thington Pump used on water
supply have given every satis-
faction the last 10 years, and have
cost only =£lo in repairs.” Two complete Worth-
ington pumping plants, intended for the Water
Supply of Kalgoorlie, have just been shipped for
Westralia. The order came by telegram from the
Westralian Government, and the pumps were
shipped within five days of receiving it.
• • •
The Worthington Engine is the world’s recog-
nised standard of pumping machinery. It is the
original Duplex pump and one of many proofs of
the esteem it commands is its host of would-be
imitators ; the enormous number of duplex pumps
now on the market as “ Worthington System,”
“Worthington Type,” “Improved Worthing-
ton,” &c., &c. The real Worthington, however,
bears the trade-mark on a small plate securely
attached, and this fact cannot be too forcibly im-
pressed upon the minds of intending purchasers.
The Company has received a good many com-
plaints from purchasers of bogus Worthington
pumps.
• * *
The Worthington Company aim at quality—that
is true cheapness. Their engines are the best that
can be produced at the price, and » ith the evi-
dence of five continents to support their merits,
they intend to uphold their name in Australia and
to defy criticism.
_ » M
The same ingenuity and stability embodied in
the construction of the steam pumping machinery,
and the same business energy and methods which
have enabled the Company to secure pre-emin-
ence in its line of manufacture will be continued
in the future as in the past, and with every prospect
of securing results which have heretofore been as
gratifying to the Company as to that portion of the
public with which it has come into business contact.

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback— the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defeet the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

A Love-Song up to Date .
(THE NEW WOMAN SINGS.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Thou art a vision of delight,
0 love, to me 1
In blissful dreams, by day and night,
Thy face I see.
My strong soul trembles at the sight,
And yearns for thee !
And yearns—and yearns—for thee.
If I could thy hard heart beguile,
Fair were my days.
0 press me to that heart awhile —
1 wear no stays !
1 love thy sweetly silly smile,
Thy foolish ways.
Thy foolish —foolish—ways.
The hairs of thy moustache, dear Fred,
My heart have speared.
0 let me lay my throbbing head,
My brow sin-seared,
Upon thy chest, and stroke thy red,
Sweet pointed beard !
Sweet pointed—pointed—beard.
This heart of mine that sounds the charge
’Gainst man’s deceit,
Doth, like the billow on the marge
Of Ocean, beat
To hear the music of thy large,
And lovely feet.
And love-ly—love-ly—feet.
1 see thee sometimes in eclipse :
Mine eyes I wipe ;
In public-houses taking nips
(Sweet, must thou swipe ?)
A cutty pipe between thy lips !
O happy pipe 1
0 hap-py—hap-py—pipe !
1 am the Oak, and thou the Vine—
O cling to me 1
Around my form thine arms entwine !
Why bashful be ?
Come, foolish, flutt’ring sweetheart mine
Sit on my knee !
Sit on my—on my —knee.

PULLEINE —FOUCARX.—August 27, at the Church

with copious detail, such as age (18), height, color

of hand, foot, etc., size of mouth, ears, head—
every item of description, in short, that is taken
of criminals. Her teeth are scheduled as “ white,
regular, and well-kept. She cycles, has a marriage
dot of £2,000,000, and a prospective fortune of
£5,000,000.

At Melb. Cup-time. A train full of book-

Mr. H. J. Samuell, the well-known music-

Item from the Wilson divorce-case (Melb.):
Further examined, the petitioner admitted that he
frequently swore ai his wife and called her names. On
one occasion he pushed her, and she fell down. He never
ran down the yard after her and threatened to cut her
throat. He would not swear he had not once run after
her with a knife, but she had done the same to him.
When they lived at Carlton he could not have pulled her
around the yard by the hair of her head, as she then had
very little hair on her head.
This certainly reads as if he had used up all her
hair pulling her round the yard at their previous
residence, but no doubt that wasn’t what he
meant. Anyhow, the moral is that women should
wear their hair short.
The man who wears a silk hat in Aus-
tralian summer-time is the least enviable of little
boys at Manly, but, if he will do it, G. H. Smith
and Son recommend their light silk toppers, in
the latest shapes, as the best possible alleviation
of his woe. Their felts, and terais, and straws,
and all the other varieties of the implement which
half humanity, in its wisdom, has seen fit to dab
its top end into, are also claimed as specially
worth inspection; and G. H. Smith and Son’s
claim invariably pans out a solid oz. to the dish.*
For coughs, colds you can’t beat Colemane
and Sons Eucalypte Extract.*
A correspondent : Earth-worms grow to
a considerable size on the Arthur River, Tas._ I
remember seeing a long string of them cooking
before the fire at a Chinaman’s camp in the gold
days. “ What you call him?” asked a Chow, hold-
ing up one of the dainty morsels for inspection;
“Those are worms, John.” “ Wolums ! Oh!
him very good chow-chow!” Then gobble-
gobble-gobble, as the reptile slowly disappeared.
The writer of the Children’s Column
in the Adelaide Evening Journal is soliciting

as he is concerned, the waifs of Australia may
look for their Xmas-dinner in the rubbish-box at
the back of the sixpenny restaurant, as usual.

The Penang Sugar Estate is situated in the district
of Haki Ilaki, north of the Island of Vitl-Levu, Fiji.
Raid Raki lies in a region termed the “ Dry Belt,”
which latter is now recognised as the best location in
Fiji for sugar-growing—the property is well watered
and irrigated. This estate is peculiarly free from damage
from “ blows.”
The plantation is worked by a staff of nine white men
(including the manager) and about 200 laborers (Indians,
Polynesians, and Fijians).
The estate will give with average seasons an annual
output of 850 to 900 tons at an expenditure of about
£BOOO.
The Property is in excellent order and easily worked,
and the labor well housed, £lOOO having been lately
spent on new coolie houses. The plant is a double crush-
ing one.
Average colored labor employed—
Indian coolies 166
Natives (Fijians) 52
Polynesian 1
Total 219

T etters received daily from all parts of the compass bear eloquent and most convincing testimony to the tact that
tins preparation stands head and shoulders above every other similar preparation on the market.
Doctors speak of it as having a “ marvellous effect ” on the growth of the hair ; and chemists say it is pushing all
other Restorers off the market. fST" One bottle of this Restorer is worth 50 of the imported rubbish You will
say 80 if you use a few bottles of it. It has been SUCCESSFUL in ARRESTING the premature DECAY of the
HAIR and making it grow when all other preparations have failed.
rr. ™ ou h , a . v ? °P 1 y to take into consideration the alarming increase of BALDNESS and the general DECAY of the
Soi?Loo h . lch 18 e J er yw here manifest, to prove that the PREPARATIONS hitherto on the market are utterly
USELESS for arresting the premature decay of the hair.
If we are not to become a bald-headed people, the vile nostrums sold as hair restorers must be wholly discarded
an< * a preparation used that is undoubtedly the very best hair-producing restorer the world has ever seen.
The secret of the success of this preparation lies in the fact that the manufacturer of it has made the haif
and its treatment a life’s study.

A Mission to Africa.
On another page is given a cartoon of the latest
dodge resorted to by explorers for doing business
with' the poor, unregenerated African heathen.
On account of the terrible massacres in the South
it has been a difficult matter to come into contact
with the principal ivory-selling tribe, “ the
Waziris,” but a thoroughly disinterested philan-
thropist hit upon the idea of doing business and,
at the same time, improving the sad existence of
the well-known “Waziris” by importing a large
supply of Frossard Cavour Cigars, which are the
favourite smoke in Europe in packets of 8 for Is.
First lie distributed a few packets amongst them ;
then, when they clamored for more, as the medium
of exchange was ivory, he erected an enormous
cardboard head on the penny-in-the-slot principle,
so that for every tusk of ivory put in at the top a
packet of Frossard’s Cavour Cigars was thrown
out at the bottom. The rush was immense; the
stock of cigars ran out before the supply of tusks,
so that he was compelled to wend his way to the
coast to ship his cargo and order fresh consign-
ments. The exchange was satisfactory to both
parties, and goes to show how popular these fra-
grant smokes are with everybody. In fact, we
cannot give any better advice to our readers,
whether white or black, than to try these weeds
after their Xmas banquet, and they will find that
although Frossard’s Oavours, like many other
things, end in smoke, “ All’s well that ends
well.”*
The lank, flat-footed agriculturist with the
black-burnt face, who drives the cows home, is
hereby admitted to be a tap-root of this great
country’s prosperity. He doesn’t talk much, and
he invariably dips his dirty hand in the milk-
bucket to get a good grip of the teat, but you can
see he’s thinking hard all the time. What he’s
after is an improved kind of cow with three
udders—one producing milk, the second best fac-
tory butter, and the third prime old Stilton cheese.
When he can invent that cow he knows his for-
tune’s made, and this is what he ponders in the
depth of that stupendous silence. In the mean-
time, all of him who are provident, and enter-
prising, and know what’s what, have purchased
one of those patent staircases to a farmer’s heaven
—the Little Giant Cream Machine Separator and
the Safety Hand Separator. These are the
simplest, cheapest, and most effective separators
known. Just write to the sole agents for N.S.W.,

Two wrongs do not make a right: do
three? Ist Squatter on the Speewa : “That
Secundus is a scoundrel. He’s killing my cattle
for rations, and I’rn bound to keep pace with him
by using his sheep.” 2nd Squatter: “Primus
thinks he has me when he makes his dummies and
cooks kill my sheep. One beef of his is worth 20
monkeys.” Next we have the opinion of Tertius,
a German selector, on both of them : “ Yell, I
don’t know vat makes men zuch roaks, von to de
oder. Brimus and Segundus both shteals their
meat from each oder, und dey subly me mid vree
beef und mutton, zo I shall hold mein tongue.”
Nervous sufferers will find ifc worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advb. on page
33 of this issue.
A reporter on a paper recently established
in the North by an Oriental gentleman, had the
temerity to put in a bill for 2s. for a fortnight’s
“expenses.” The proprietor looked at it and
heaved a bitter sigh. “ This is simply ruinous,”
said he; “I started this paper with the idea of
working it cheap, but here I get extras that are
just crushing. 1 shall have to think over it.”
“But,” said the humble scribe, fingering his hat
nervously, “ the 2s. is for expenses out of pocket.”
“Out of my pocket, young man,” said the pro-
prietor. He is still thinking over it.

Here Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sneep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try vour Remedies. On Thursday before Good I riday I took the first
of your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

To Here Rassmussen.
Dear Sir,—l have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline
Remedies have acted most wonderful in my case, and I consider that
the great virtues you claim for them have been entirely substantiated —
not only in my case, but in several of my family and acquaintances to
whom I have recommended their use. I consider they are far more
efficacious than any remedy yet brought before the public. I consider
you are second to none as a human benefactor.
I am, yours truly, EDWARD DREW.
A Lady’s Wish Fulfilled.
It gives me great pleasure indeed to inform you that your cele-
brated Alfaline Universal Pills cured me, when all other remedies and
doctors failed, of a stubborn case of Debility ot 18 years’ standing. My
wish is fulfilled at last, and I don’t know how to thank you enough.
Dear Sir, I shall recommend your Alfaline Remedies to all sufferers I
come across. You are quite at liberty to publish or make what use you
like of this testimonial, and anyone writing to me will have full
particulars. I am, yours respectfully, Mrs. E. SMITH, Port Mac-
quarie, Hastings River, N.S.W.

To Herr Rassmussen,
Dear Sir,—l am jubilant to inform you that your wonderful
Alfaline Pills completely cured me of a very obstinate internal com-
plaint ; and that, although I am now over 70 years of age, I feel as
strong as any young man, and shall always be grateful to you.
Yours very truly, N. LARSEN.
Severe Nervousness Cured.
Stamp Office, G.P.0., Sydney, Sept. 1, 1892.

standing.—Yours gratefully, H. TOST.

Parkes Range, Southern Cross, Western Australia.
I have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline Lock Pills
completely cured me of a serious blood affection of three years’ stand-
ing, I shall always be glad to recommend your Alfaline Remedies to
my friends. You are at liberty to publish this testimonial for’the
benefit of other similar sufferers.
Yours gratefully, JAMES NELSON WILLIAMS.
The Liver Cured.
To Herr Rassmussen. 64 Washington-street, Sydney.
Dear Sir, —Your Remedies cured me of a very obstinate and com-
plicated complaint after all the doctors gave me up. I suffered greatly
from the Liver and Nerves. Yours truly, ROBERT ALBURY.

Snalse-Blte Antidote — The New Ctn-e,
Hypodermic Injection of Chlorinated Solution of Lime.
THIE above remedy for the cure of Snake-Bite should be in the possession of every one living in the country. Pro-
fessor Halford, of the University of Melbourne, in a work which he has just published on the Action of Snake
Venom on the Blood, mentions that he has received a contribution from the Pasteur Institute of France, on the
Hypodermic injection of Chlorinated Solution of Lime, as an Antidote to the Venom of Snake-Bite, ; and gives a full
account of a number of test experiments which have been made by Dr. A. Calmette, the discoverer of the Antidote.
These tests have been recently confirmed on a human being by Dr. M'Kenzie, of Korrumburra, Vic.
The directions how to use the Antidote are simple, and can be readily understood by anyone of ordinary intel-
ligence. If the services of a doctor cannot be obtained within half-an-hour after the person has been bitten, the
Antidote should be immediately injected according to the directions which are printed on the bottle containing the
solution.
The Concentrated Solution is specially prepared by
R. J. M'FARLANE, PHARMACEUTICAL CHEMIST,
136 Elizabetll-31., IVCellooume (between Bourke-st. and Little Collins st.),
from whom the Hypodermic Syringe suitable for use may also be obtained.
Price of Solution and Syringe, 10/6, forwarded by post. Cost of carriage to be added to postal
note, money order, etc., which will receive immediate attention.
