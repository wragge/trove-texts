NOW THAT THE Sydney Opera
House is becoming the Sydney Concert
Hall the question has come up about
what should be done with the now
surplus $3,000,000 worth of stage
machinery. Perhaps someone else in
Sydney might like to build an Opera
House to put it in.
Passing-out
WE ARE INDEBTED to the latest
issue of the University of Virginia
newspaper, the “Cavalier,” for this item
from its passing-out report on Sir
Robert Menzies: “While he was lectur-
ing at Drury College in Springfield,
Missouri, he was presented with a cer-
tificate from the Ozark Hillbilly Club
declaring him an Honorary Hillbilly.”
Quick
INSTANT ASSIMILATION: A BUL-
LETIN reporter last week heard a
recently arrived Italian immigrant say
in a bus to a recently arrived English
immigrant: “Don’t you call me ‘mate,’
you Pommy!”
Liberalism
THE LAST OUTPOST of old-
fashioned free-enterprise thinking went
west in Perth last week when the
Young Liberal Movement’s convention,
although voting that prostitution be
legalised, added a rider that adequate
Government control was needed.
Lovelorn
WE HAVE BEEN following for several
months the development by some Syd-
ney newspapers of Advice to the Love-
lorn columns. A recent letter, addressed
to the best-known Miss Lonelyhearts ip
Sydney, signed only by initials, com-
plained that the author was unable to
get girls off the mind; they haunted
the letter’s author day and night. Is
there, read the plea, anything wrong
with me? “Not,” read the admirably
succinct reply, “if you’re a man.”
Head
IN THE LATEST issue of the “World
Journal Tribune” World Almanac the
Australian head of State is given as
“Lord Richard G. Casey.”

lines are those who go back home.

A detour to
Rutherglen's
festival
THE PRESIDENT of the Rutherglen
Wine Festival Committee —Mr. George
Sutherland Smith, jun. has
announced that there will be another
festival, probably in 1968.
This is heartening news, for the ’67
festival was a little beauty. Ruther-
glen is a town of 1600 people by the
Murray. Normally the most exciting
event all day is the sight of a dog
stretching.
There are 15 vineyards in the area,
and for these past 100 years none of
them has ever thought about doing
anything in the way of promotion. So
they approached the festival with some
timidity and few people really thought
it would work.
They misunderstood one thing
the magic of the word “alcohol” over
one of Victoria’s dreary long week-
ends. Crowds descended from a radius
of 200 miles. Your correspondent had
the problem of while doing his drink-
ing in Rutherglen having to sleep 50
miles out of town.
Extra teams of police were brought
in, the streets had to be barricaded off
to stop traffic, something which hadn’t
been done since the gold rush of the
1860 s.
Rutherglen is all veranda posts and
weatherboard and this was a marvellous
help to decoration. They wound vine
leaves around all the veranda posts.
Tourists
Every shop in town, hat shops, dress
shops, newsagents, even the very res-
pectable “dispensing chemist” had dis-
plays of Frontignac, port, and muscat.
A busload of Tasmanian tourists visited
Rutherglen on the Friday and one
Tasmanian lady was heard to ask
another: was there any escape, every
shop appeared to be a wine saloon.
That night there was the big ball. In
the entrance of the Memorial Hall
they had a lovely 500-gallon oak cask,
and to get the vintage look they had
the ceiling covered in plastic “scare
bird” normally used for fruit trees.
Yes, the hall looked as if it were
superbly covered in cobwebs from end to
end.
With the hors-d’oeuvre we had Linde-
man’s special reserve flor fine sherry
(four gold medals), and Seppelts gold
medal Amontillado; with the potage
there was Brown Bros. Rhine riesling
’66, silver medal Melbourne; with the
dindon aux cerises we had All Saints
cabernet-shiraz ’65, bronze Sydney; and
with the Cassata et fruit we had
Morris’ magnificent gold-medals-all-
over-the-place brown muscat.
Next morning there was the auction
of Rare Wines, and one knew that
things were really going to move when
one noticed the line-up of splendid
cars. Mr. Douglas Seabrook, who was
assisting the auctioneer, at one stage
had to ask a gentleman if he would
kindly move his Aston Martin. Many
of the wines were not particularly rare,
but 35 dozen fetched a total of $1195.
One dozen lot which was available a
few weeks ago for $9.50 a dozen sold
at $44. One dealer was heard to say:
“Geez, if only a man had time to whip
in a truckload. I’m running auctions
three times a week from now on.”
Top prices were $5l for a dozen
Great Western burgundy 1952, and
$22 for a single bottle of Chambers
1895 muscat. As it went off, somebody
said: “I reckon he’ll want to drink
that out of a thimble.”
Floats
There was a grand float parade
through town on the Saturday after-
noon. There were floats depicting gold-
mining, the tramping of grapes, and a
float depicting an illicit still with the
boys getting into the grappa. One felt
that some of the floats might not have
passed Mr. Don Ingersole of Moomba.
For example, they had a float which
boasted nothing more than a country
“dunny.” It had witty signs on it like
“HMS Thunderbox,” “Double Sittings
“Stroll out the Barrel! We’ll have
a barrel..."
Arranged,” and, glory be, they had
someone sitting on the throne inside.
On Saturday night there was the
barbecue on the football ground. The
night was nice and warm like Mick
Morris’ muscat and the crowds rolled
in by the thousand. George Smith
brought in 650 gallons of wine. They
had it in stainless steel barrels with
the plastic hoses and pluto taps. They
kept the wine flowing by pumping up
the air pressure. You paid 20 cents
deposit for your glass and one shilling
for your wine. “How’d you like it,
mate? Carbonated red or carbonated
white?”
Some of our more distinguished
winemasters would have had a quiet
stroke at the sight of all this, but
actually the wine was very drinkable
indeed.
The liquor laws were a little re-
stricting for total bacchanalian fun. The
wine auction was a problem. You can’t
just go selling wine outside in the
street. Finally the committee had to
get the Star Hotel to buy the lot. So-
you bid for your wine and collected
it at the hotel.
Then there was Sunday. Sell wine
on the Sabbath! What are you sug-
gesting? “We will give it away then,”
said George Smith. Ah, but it was-
discovered that during the Sunday
lunchtime barbecue they would be sell-
ing programs. If programs were sold
close by the free wine then they would
be up for sly-grogging.
Giveaways
Finally they solved the problem this
way. The committee gave away 3000
pint bottles, but motorists received
their bottles three-quarters of a mile
before they reached the reserve.
The rest of the time the thing to
do was visit the vineyards. There was
the opportunity to taste, and one
worked one’s way gently from the
delicate rieslings through to the big
calibre ports and muscats, and in the
north-east we can produce bigger
calibres than almost anywhere else on
earth. At some vineyards it was just
like Young & Jacksons at 5 o’clock.
At All Saints, the nice old vine-
yard, designed after the Castle of Mey,
something like 65 quality stemmed
wine-glasses were stolen or smashed in
one afternoon.
During all this the Rutherglen Shire
Council received a circular letter from
the Alcoholism Foundation of Victoria.
The foundation was asking for money
for a rehabilitation centre for alcoholics
and it wanted councils to call public
meetings to raise money. Wisely the
Rutherglen Council decided to defer
action on this until later.
The Rutherglen Wine Festival was
followed by the Myrtleford Hops and
Tobacco Festival over Easter. This had
the blessing of Carlton & United
Breweries. It is better known as the
Beer and Smokes Festival. Oh, yes,
there’s lots of fun to be had in the
north-east.

Cosmonauts,
Richie, Wanda
suspect, and all
FOR SIR RODEN CUTLER, Gover-
nor of New South Wales, the first morn-
ing of the Royal Easter Show was all
bulls. Angus, Beef Shorthorns, and
Herefords, to be exact, on which he
placed prizewinning felt sashes plus his
personal accolade of a regal pat on the
head. Then he disappeared into the
Royal Agricultural Society’s building
for lunch. Well, we trust for lunch. His
visit was a surprise. Not even the Press
office knew he had called until he left.
(Sir Roden, incidentally, was not there
to open the Show. That was done a
day or two later by Lord Casey, who
made a very speech, suitable to
the occasion: “To our north there are
the developing countries of Asia, where
agricultural production is not keeping
pace with their population growth:” We
could help them, he said, but only if
they asked. Then he turned to Aus-
tralian agriculture.)
For us, with $32 million worth of
goods to examine, the smell of Scott’s
pies assaulting the nostrils, the sudden
blazing sun and equally unexpected
sartorial elegance of men in their broad-
brimmers and moleskin pants, the mix-
ture was almost too heady to handle.
Over by Manufacturers’ Hall the
newly imported U.S. Army Band from
Vietnam played a stirring march and
four trombonists leapt to their feet for
solo in genuine American film style.
Leaning against Manufacturers’ Hall
was the band’s P.R.0., Sergeant Don
Perkins, in midst of attack by ants; arid
feeling, he said, rather pianissimo.
Three parties the night before and an
acute hangover today. Was this what
life in Sydney was like? No, he wasn’t
musical, he was an ex-newsman on the
Omaha “World Herald,” and that’s
where he was returning, he hoped.
Meanwhile he and the band travelled
round Vietnam boosting morale, but
what he found sticky was digging out
real human interest stories on the band.
Most of them were too Philharmonic
for his liking.
The band packed up and, followed
by the crowd, became a Pied Piper
attraction as they wandered past Richie
Benaud batting balls by Slazengers
from the newest thing in bowlers: an
automatic drum. As we arrived Mr.
Benaud, sweating profusely, flung down
his bat and said he’d had enough. Just
then the Governor’s silver Rolls-Royce
crept past. Inside, pressed to one
corner by two large-men, Sir Roden
waved from the wrist and a small boy
asked ’oo was that? Mr. Cutler, said
his mum, he’s something to do with
the Queen. The task of steering him
through the crowds was left to a trio
of police outriders. One said it wasn’t
so easy as it looked, ho! dear no. At a
thing like the Easter Show they had to
give way to pedestrians. On the high-
way it was the other way round, ho!,
dear yes.
And what were the death-defying
Cosmonauts up to all this time? They
had been sunbathing. Now, after lunch,
Arthur, Isolde, and Frances Dutchek
appeared to check their high-wire
equipment, the girls wearing day make-
up of black false eyelashes against chalk-
white skin. What they most wanted,
they said, was a fall — meaning false
hair — and did we know their green
sequinned costumes cost $250 a time?
They lasted two years performing inside
and only one in the open because of the
wind. All three Dutcheks are heavily
insured by Lloyds of London, and the
premiums are fnonumental. Arthur has
fallen twice and still feels sick at the
thought of going up there. (“Don’t you
believe it,” said a reporter, sotto voce.
“I’ve examined that bike and it’s as
safe as houses.”) They are giving it up
soon and returning to terra firma
cabaret. That, says Arthur, needs talent,
up there only needs guts.
Over at the Police Museum, this
year’s new attraction was a macabre
still-life of the Wanda Beach murders,
plus verbal commentary from behind
the scenes describing the crime. “I was
going to say if you looked you could
still see the bloodmarks on the beach
bags” a young policeman told us
cheerfully, “but, of course, they were
washed off by the sea.” The idea was
to get customers in and out quickly.
The day wore on and with it came
blisters and a raging headache. We
rested awhile at field events, inter-
spersed by annoying commercials
(“Make it easy for yourself and use
A.W.I. Star Steel Fence Posts”), then,
bypassing the candy-floss and stomach-
turning wheels, we called in at Arts
and Crafts. Here a lady pressed us to
give a party to sell plastic teasets (10
percent in it for us). Thence to
Animals, where we saw pink, green,
and blue lambs (“just plain ICI dye”
said their owner) and dyed chickens:
“SOME CHICKS MAY BE SLEEP-
ING IN STRANGE POSITIONS —
THERE IS NOTHING THE
MATTER WITH THEM AS YOU
MAY THINK” assured a printed
notice,.
We bought a genuine Aboriginal
spear with plastic head for 45 cents,
queued an hour for transport home
and when we arrived discovered that
somewhere in the acres of Royal
Easter Show we had missed an exhibit
they had never ever had before: our
front-door key.

the most thick skinned cars in the world
A BMC car, and BMC alone, gives you the investment and safety protection of
Rotodip 7 skin deep rust protection. Rotodip is unique because car bodies actually
rotate through special cleaning and rustproofing solutions. Result: no air pockets
can form; every inch of the body, inside and out is treated. Rust (it starts on the
inside) can’t form, can’t weaken the inherent body strength of your car. Rotodip
rust protection is one reason why your BMC car is safer. Others: BMC's better
front wheel handling, better braking, unique stay-on-line Hydrolastic* fluid
suspension. You buy a safe car, an advanced car when you buy BMC. There's one
to suit your needs exactly!

Advice on
the benefits
of butterfats
GHEE IS PROBABLY best known by
retired British Army officers who break-
fast at Veeraswamy’s. And it is prob-
ably best known to them as rancid
buffalo butter.
In India vast quantities of this
animal fat are used to give an essential
flavor basis for the great curry dishes
that have created a cult of asbestos-
tongued addicts throughout the world.
You can buy good curry powders
about one in twenty are almost satis-
factory but as for Ghee, this is
unprocurable.
Unprocurable? You probably think
you’ve seen it in a gold plastic pot
a green tin a yellow tin - a gold
tin with red printing in a silver foil
wrapper. You’re wrong. Even though in
their undoubted wisdom dairy com-
panies have called it Ghee - it isn’t
the same product. ,
Australian Ghee is really a cow in
buffalo clothing. And, purchased under
a multiplicity of brand names, it also
suffers from a degree of difficult-to-
digest bureaucratic red tape.
Apparently the Health Department
permits the use of the titles “Butter-
fat” or “Butteroil” in lieu of the extra-,
ordinarily unsatisfactory word “Ghee.,
Whilst both alternatives are entirely'
true, and better than “Ghee,” it is
still true to call it Clarified Butter, but;
this is not permitted, although, apart
from the absolute minimum degree of
moisture, Ghee is 99.8 percent pure
butterfat. If this doesn’t mean clarified,
then I’ll eat Mrs. Jones’ other hat.
The culinary process is well knownj
throughout the world’s civilised kit-
chens and is always described as “How
to clarify butter.” But clarifying does
not mean removing impurities. They are
perfectly edible solids which are re-
moved, and the only reason they are
removed is to carry the butter flavor l
into recipes that require high heat to I
brown meat or vegetables. Clarified i
butter can give new flavor to dishes j
which, by tradition, have always suf-
fered the attacks of drippings and oddly
flavored oils that are not entirely
suited to our sense of smell.
And, according to a Mr. G. W.
Coombs, in a paper he has written in
the New Zealand Journal of Science,
Ghee is most digestible. Mr. Coombs,

B
in the manner of a researcher, writes
somewhat indigestibly himself. He
couches his findings in a literary style
that I call “colander writing,” that is
to base one’s premise upon a series of
intricate loopholes through which one
can break if the need should arise. I
mention this point of style because I
must not attempt to deliver his findings
in a more digestible form.
“Quite a large number of people, at
one stage of life or another, suffer from
one or more of the following disorders
of the digestive system: Nervous Dys-
pepsia, Heartburn, Heartburn during
pregnancy, Nausea, Waterbrash, Vomit-
ing, Inflammation of liver and gall
bladder, Ulcers (Duodenal and Gas-
tric), Colitis, Diverticulitis (yoiks what
a word), Diarrhoea, and Constipation.
“It is suggested, with quite a large
amount of factual evidence, that all
these disorders can be either alleviated
or cured by restricting one’s diet to
the use of butterfat as a frying, baking,
and general cooking ingredient. In
the experiments carried out, it was most
interesting to learn that many of the
group who agreed to participate in the
tests had suffered from gastric com-
plaints for 12 to 17 years, notwith-
standing the careful application of
special ‘fat-free’ diets recommended by
their physicians. Of a total 38 subjects,
all but six gained relief from pain or
were actually cured of their complaint.”
Mr. Coombs quite rightly comments
upon the need to relate their success
to the strict way in which these patients
were instructed to use the clarified
butter provided. They were guided in
the following way (in which one “g”
equals
MEATS: Remove all visible fat. For
frying use a minimum amount of but-
terfat for one operation only, varying
from, say, 6g. for a thin steak to 30g.
for crumbed fish cutlets, pancakes, etc.,
and adjusting the amount so that the
cooking vessel is free of fat when
cooking is complete. For oven-baking
use a rack, and brush on butterfat at
intervals during cooking, or baste with
a mixture of equal parts of butterfat
and flour.
VEGETABLES: Steam in saucepan
with 3g. of butterfat and a quarter-
inch of water. (Cabbage is first shred-
ded and no water added.) For oven
roast, treat as for meat. For frying,
sear on both sides at 350 deg. F. and
then reduce to 300 deg. F. For baking,
sear and crisp at 400 deg. F. and then
reduce to 350 deg. F. (I disagree with
this suggestion finding a stable
350 deg. F. more economic.)
OTHER FOODS: Do not eat cooked
foods containing fat other than butter-
fat. In all domestically prepared cakes,
pastry, biscuits, and confectionery, use
only butterfat.
As you can see there is a very
small quantity of fat used in each
case, but at least it means that those
sufferers (who had in the past been
restricted to a fat-free diet and still
suffered) had been able to enjoy fried
and roasted food without suffering.

ON THE
MARGIN
O mistress mine,
why are you
grumbling?
THE PROBLEMS OF mistresses are
being given a hearing at last. In a TV
program called “The Other Woman”
the BBC interviewed a representative
group of concubines, and viewers were
shocked by the unhappiness and hard-
ships that were laid bare. The women
were grossly neglected by their lovers,
Who often spent most of their time
with their wives. It was made plain
that mistresses had no security of
tenure, no prospect of promotion, and
no superannuation rights.
While most groups in society today
have organised to protect their interests
in trade unions, chambers of manu-
factures, and so on mistresses are
still no better off than they were a
century ago. Their status, relative to
that of wives, has actually declined.
The Housewives’ Association is a
vigorous pressure group, but a
Mistresses’ Association does not yet exist.
To some degree the plight of mis-
tresses is due to a failure in public
relations. The renown of a few favorites
of men of high rank, such celebrities
as Madame Pompadour and Lily Lang-
try, has givfen mistresses in general a
luxurious image. The world forgets that
there are many obscure, hard-working
mistresses who rarely see a diamond
bracelet or a bottle of champagne.
The first, question that faces a woman
in this situation' is whether she can
combine mistressing with a career. The'
answer depends largely on the attitude
of the man concerned. Some men,
especially those of limited means,
encourage their mistresses to retain
their jobs. Others feel it is lowering
to a man’s status if people know that
his mistress goes out to work. They
argue that being a competent mistress
is a full-time task. Yet a girl takes a
considerable risk if she sacrifices her
independence to settle down in domes-
ticity as the little other woman.
To give an example: Miss A. threw
up a good secretarial position to devote
herself to her duties as mistress of Mr.
D., a company director. He said he
wanted her to provide hjm with all
the comforts of a second home. But
after a while he began to take Miss A.
for granted. On their first anniversary
she prepared a nice dinner for two,
and put on her prettiest outfit; but
Mr. D. did not turn up. She spent the
evening knitting, while he made merry
in a nightclub with his glamorous wife.
Miss A. eventually left Mr. D. because
she found he was a mistress-beater.
Mistresses often complain, and with
reason, about the parsimony of men
in financial matters. A man will set a
girl up in a love nest, then fail to
provide adequate nestkeeping money.
Miss T., a disillusioned mistress, says
of a former protector: “First he began
making ' little economies. He would
say: ‘Do you really need another black
negligee?’ or ‘Why don’t you try giv-
ing yourself a home perm?’ Soon he
had me buying my perfume in chain
stores. The only holiday-I got was a
weekend at Manly, but he took his
family away for a fortnight at Surfers
Paradise. That was when I handed in
my resignation.”
The men concerned point out, in
their own defence, that expenses in-
curred in maintaining a mistress are
not tax-deductible. Nor does, the govern-
ment make any allowance for the in-
surance or depreciation of mistresses.
All this adds to the financial burden,
so that when there is a downturn in
business conditions the mistress is
usually the first to tighten her belt.
The truth is that men often light-
heartedly assume the responsibility of
taking a mistress before thay can afford
it. They are deluded by the old fallacy
that three can live as cheaply as two.
Some social workers advocate 'the
formation of a Concubinage Guidance
Council, to help in the selection of
mistresses and to advise couples whose
illicit unions are in danger of going
on the rocks. It is possible that in some
cases timely advice could prevent the
br ( eak-up of a once-happy menage.
But in the long run the responsibility
for keeping mistresses contented rests
with their menfolk. A man should show
interest. He should notice when his
mistress has a new dress, or hair-style,
and , compliment her it. Little
things like, this are important to her.
Above all he should try to preserve
the romance in their relationship. After
dinner he should not fall asleep in front
of his mistress’ TV set. He must make
her feel she is as exciting as. a wife.
A few militant, hard-core concubines
favor changes in the law, to guarantee
full-time mistresses the basic wage plus
a margin for skill. There is also talk
of provision for long-service leave. But
these reforms will probably achieve
little without male co-operation. The
idea that mistresses can be made happy
by act of Parliament is an old de facto
wives’ tale.

AUSTRALIA
Chamberlain v Whitlam:
the move that rebounded
from Alan Reid in Canberra
OPPOSITION LEADER Gough Whit-
lam is taking a big gamble. At every
opportunity he gets he tells ALP forums
that the structure of the ALP Federally
is outmoded, archaic, unrepresentative,
a horse-and-buggy survival in a sputnik
age.
If Whitlam’s gamble is successful
and he manages to persuade the ALP
into reform of its Federal structure, he
will not lose any electoral skin. In fact,
he would be helping to secure the new
image for Labor that he realises is
desperately needed if it is to improve
its electoral position.
But if Whitlam fails to persuade the
ALP into reform, he might have to
pay the price at the next Federal elec-
tions.
Everything that Whitlam is saying on
this subject is being taken down and
will undoubtedly be used in evidence
against him and the Labor Party when
the present Parliament runs its term.
Unless he gets the reforms, his
political opponents will undoubtedly
throw in Labor’s teeth everything Whit-
lam has said about the unsuitability of
the existing ALP structure to meet the
demands of a modern age, and Whit-
lam himself will be quoted as the
authority.
Realisation that this was the position
contributed to Mr. F. E. (“Joe”)
Chamberlain, ALP secretary in Western
Australia and former ALP Federal
“strong man,” working himself into an
untenable position last week.
Chamberlain does not want reform to
the existing structure of the ALP
least of all the type of reform W'hitlam
wants, which would immeasurably
strengthen the position of the Right-
wing N.S.W. ALP against the States
(notably Victoria) which are the source
of Left-wing Federal ALP strength.
Chamberlain has defended the existing
structure in the past. Quite clearly he
wants to preserve it in the future.
Basically, Chamberlain’s criticism of
what Whitlam was seeking to do was
cojnmon sense (particularly if what
Whitlam is seeking to do cannot be
achieved).
As Chamberlain pointed out, Whit-
lam could be digging deeper Labor’s
political grave. Said Chamberlain, “In
the event of conference deciding
against any major change (still a dis-
tinct possibility: the Labor Party is
notoriously conservative on such things),
then we are left with the allegation
from the Leader that we are con-
tinuing to function with less than a
reasonably effective constitution.”
This is a valid criticism of the method
Whitlam is using to secure ALP struc-
tural reforms. But having said that,
Chamberlain went a step further,
saying, “The councils of the Party are
the proper place for such advocacy (or
reform), not the public Press.”
Somehow or other, Chamberlain
failed to realise that he was charging
Whitlam with precisely the offence that
he was committing himself. Just to
make matters worse, Chamberlain’s
charge against Whitlam was incorrect.
Whitlam may, on occasions, be in-
discreet, but he is not stupid. He has
been careful to see that his views on
the necessity for ALP structural reform
have been limited to recognised Labor
forums.
Chamberlain’s inability to recognise
that he was committing the offence he
was alleging against Whitlam could
have been a case of dislike overcoming
judgment. He has rubbed Whitlam’s
political nose mercilessly in the dirt in
the past. He may have judged that here
was an opportunity when he could have
repeated that performance. But his
move backfired. Instead of Whitlam’s
nose it was Chamberlain’s.
When the W.A. ALP executive
assembled last week, Chamberlain, of
his own volition, apparently apologised
to it for having made his criticisms of
Whitlam’s approach to ALP reform to
a newspaper.
Chamberlain got away with it, but
only just. The motion that his apology
be received and noted was carried after
a anti-Chamberlain motion had been
defeated. The vote was reported to be
41-37.
For Chamberlain it was a bad break.
His power, though still significant
Federally, is waning in Western Aus-
tralia. He would probably have pre-
ferred to avoid an incident that pointed
up the extent.
Such incidents encourage others to
challenge his authority. Oddly, this one
could have an effect upon the wider
struggle involving ALP structural
reform.
The incident will undoubtedly en-
courage those in Western Australia who
Opposition Leader E. G. Whitlam
hold views similar to Whitlam on the
necessity for structural reform to per-
sist with their attempts to swing their
State to support Whitlam.
This issue will be fought out at the
next Federal ALP conference in South.
Australia in July.
Wool and, wheat
Marketing
AN INSIGHT INTO farmer logic is
provided by Mr. A. C. Everett, a
Victorian wheatgrower, who asserts that
lack of an orderly marketing plan for
wool is “dragging the wheat industry
into the economic mire.”
Mr. Everett is one of the grand old
men of wheat stabilisation. With Jack
McEwen he was one of the first to join
the old Farmers’ Union, which later
became the Country Party. He is a
long-time grower member on the Aus-
tralian Wheat Board, and two years ago
visited Russia as part of a wheat selling
delegation. He has been so close to
the Wheat Board since its inception
that many farmers, and others, accept
his views as a reflection of ideas which
the Board, officially, is careful not to
make public.
Going on his report to last week’s
Victorian Wheat and Woolgrowers’
Association annual meeting, the Board
is worried, very worried, about the
disposal of this year’s record 450 mil-
lion-bushel crop. Mr. Everett said the
quantity to be exported during
1966-67 would be approximately 357


million bushels. Of this amount, 150
million bushels was covered by the
guaranteed (Commonwealth Govern-
ment) price of 151 2-3rd cents per
bushel. Therefore approximately 207
million bushels (allowing for the home
consumption and seeding) would have
to be sold on the free world market,
which would mean that growers’ returns
“would be depreciated.”
A higher guaranteed price, said Mr.
Everett, was an urgent matter in the
new stabilisation plan to be negotiated
between the Wheat Board and the
Government this year. “Because there
is no orderly marketing plan for wool,
growers are turning to wheat, par-
ticularly in New South Wales,” he
said. “With the present inadequate
storage and harbor position for handling
wheat in some States, an orderly
marketing plan for the wool industry
is of great national urgency.”
What Mr. Everett seems to be call-
ing for now is a plan to correct the
shortcomings of another plan. His sum-
ming up of the world wheat situation
nevertheless seems realistic. He said:
“The Wheat Board does not have
markets for all the crop at present and
is searching for more new outlets with
some success. It is known that India
requires more wheat, but the exchange
position is an impediment, although
this may be overcome. The world
potential demand is there but the money
is not.”
Trade unions
New giants
IN THE UNIONS lately the talk is all
of mergers, federations, and amalgama-
tions. By the end of June three of
Australia’s largest building unions,
representing more than 90,000 workers,
will have merged, according to the
Federal Secretary of the Building
Workers’ Industrial Union, Mr. Purse.
The 50,000-strong BWIU has been
negotiating for some months with the
Operative Painters and Decorators’
Union and the Operative Plasterers
and Plaster Workers’ Federation.
The Federal Councils of the three
unions support the merger and will
conduct a ballot on it among their
members. The result will be known
late in June. If passed, the present
Federal and State administrative
machinery of the unions would lose its
identity and an entirely new union
would be formed.
The Federal councils of the unions
claim that the major reason for the
merger is to avoid duplication in the
work of officials and in arbitration pro-
ceedings. They also hope that the
greater numbers of the proposed amal-
gamation will increase their bargaining
power.
Immigration Minister Snedden
Right-wing union leaders, however,
claimed that the BWIU was “swallow-
ing up” its smaller associates for politi-
cal as well as industrial reasons. They
said the merger was in line with Com-
munist Party policy witnessed before
in the establishment of the Federation
of Transport Unions, a federation of
Left-wing unions, such as the Railways
and Tramways’, which attempted to
escape from the authority of the ACTU.
Last week, too, a meeting of repre-
sentatives of the Union of Postal
Clerks and Telegraphists, the
Amalgamated Postal Workers’ Union,
and the Australian Postmasters’ Asso-
ciation was held in Melbourne and
decided to advocate that a Federal
Council be established of workers in
their industry. The three unions said
they were concerned about the increas-
ing tendency to employ untrained and
casual labor on postal communications.
The threat of automation and the
increasing costs of efficient union
negotiation and administration are addi-
tional reasons given for the setting-up
of a Federal body.
The trend toward unification in the
unions is likely to be matched soon by
greater unity amongst employer organi-
sations. The Associated Chambers of
Manufactures recently called on
employer organisations to get together
and stop dissipating their energies.
The Federal Director, Mr. R. W. C.
Anderson, said there were too many
employers organisations in Australia,
too much duplication of effort, and
too little liaison amongst employer
representatives.
Immigration
Intake, output
IN GOOD TRADITION the new
Minister for Immigration, Mr. Snedden,
waxes eloquent about the success of his
program this year. The target of
148,000 settlers is certainly likely to be
attained. But this figure for gross intake
is not the true measure of the gain to
the population through migration.
The increased number of settlers this
financial year is more than offset
through a greater flow of people leav-
ing. About 65,000 Australians are now
leaving the country each year. This is
more than double the number going
out at the beginning of the decade, and
it has not been matched by a corres-
ponding increase in returnees. The
net loss of Australians through long-
term or permanent movement is up
from 15,000 to over 30,000 a year.
In addition, the number of settlers
returning to their homeland has risen
strongly year by year. On the official
statistics it was running at 6000 in
1960 and rose slowly to 8000 two years
ago. 1965 saw the number almost double
to 14,803 and last year to 18,344.
And the statistics are believed to
seriously understate the position. The
Australian-born children of migrants
are excluded from the figures and so
are settlers who leave within 12 months.
And to get into the statistical category
people have to say they came as a
settler and admit a mistake.
The real figure is probably twice the
published statistic. The washout is that
Australia’s net gain through all forms
of migration is down: it was only
86,949 last year, 104,856 in 1965.
In the short term there is not very
much cause for alarm. With relatively
cheaper, quicker international trans-
port and affluent societies in Western
Europe, migration is a much less final
affair than in the bleak post-war years.
Europe, opened up by the Common
Market, sees millions of workers mov-
ing across international borders.
Many of our migrants come to have
a look, to have a two-year working
holiday, fares paid by the Australian
Government. The latest racket is to
use the system to come as an “assisted
settler,” getting the trip out for £lO
sterling; then on arrival declare an
intention not to stay the required two
years and repay the small balance.
Since 1961 North-western Europe
has virtually dried up as a source of
migrants for Australia. And no wonder.
1961 and 1962 saw unemployment in
Australia at levels intolerable to Euro-
peans, and the years have seen several
countries equal our material standards
of living.
Western Europe expects to become a
net receiver of migrants on a large scale
in the next decade all northern
countries will be gaining by migration.
Even Italy, Greece, and Spain expect
major declines in emigration.
Italy, for instance, from losing well
over 150,000 of its people a year by
emigration, expects a reduction to a
rate of 30,000. Ireland expects emigra-
tion to halve. Communist Yugoslavia is
already a rich source of migrants, our
fourth richest, in fact.
The Immigration Department is
cautiously nibbling away at the White
Australia policy. Lebanon, Egypt, and
Turkey are now considered suitable
countries from which to garner
migrants and the trickle of Asians
admitted is now a little larger.


Football
Transfers
THE FOOTBALLERS’ transfer fees
season is in full swing. A Tasmanian
(New Norfolk) player, wanted in Vic-
toria, has had a $lO,OOO transfer fee
placed on his services and says he
feels like a piece of prize livestock. A
Victorian Rugby Union player, Wallaby
representative Dick Webb, signed with
a Sydney Rugby League club on a
contract worth several thousand dol-
lars, has no complaints; but two Queens-
landers, Gallagher and Cavanagh, have
many. They to play with
North Sydney, which was to pay $10,090
Dick Webb on the wing
for each, but the Queensland Rugby
League banned their transfers.
Soccer players’ transfer fees seem
to be more reasonable in Australia so
far. (Top international Soccer players
cost upi to $1 million to “buy.”) A
Newcastle Soccer player has been trans-
ferred to Hakoah of Sydney for only
$5600.
To non-sports people who read such
figures it is not always clear that the
money is paid from club to club. The
player receives none of it, although he
gets side benefits according to his
“value.”
Juries
Opting in
QUEENSLAND HAS AT last passed
a Bill giving women the right, without
obligation, to serve on juries. Said one
legislator, Mrs. Jordon (ALP, Ipswich
West), “Women for too long have sat
on the sidelines watching the pot boil.
Now they must participate.”
An Independent (Mr. Walsh, Bunda-
berg) replied that many women who
had loudly advocated this “so - called
reform” would be the first to opt out.
. This seems true in New South Wales,
where recently the Justice Minister,
Mr. Maddison, said he was disap-
pointed with the response. Women did
not rush to volunteer when jury service
for them became possible. Lack of
facilities for women slowed the move-
ment, districts being proclaimed as suit-
able only as Courthouses were modern-
ised.
Today, there are only about 1300
registered as willing to serve, and their
inclusion in juries has naturally been
fractional.
The system works better in other
States; relatively well in South Aus-
tralia, and best of all in Western Aus-
tralia, where women have been serving
on juries since 1961. There are about
four women for every seven fhen on
the jurors’ register, and the Sheriff’s
Office tries to maintain that proportion
in offering jurors for cases.
Industry
Women's work
HERE AND THERE, now and then,
one hears of women breaking through
the barriers to men-only jobs and
sometimes wonders why they made the
choice. In Western Australia, one firm,
Chamberlain Industries, advertised
machine-shop jobs for women, received
nearly 300 applications, and is starting
suitable ones each week, on drilling
and turning machines and lathes.
This is understandable. Many women
did such jobs during World War 11.
But in Tasmania six women have gone
much further, taking jobs in a saw-
mill, stacking timber processed by 60
men. One of the new workers, a former
barmaid, says stacking timber is, natur-
ally, much more tiring.
Tasmania
Fluoride
IF SOME OF THE anti-fluoride state-
ments voiced in Australia are mildly
startling, the pro-fluoride experts are
quick on the counter-attack.
Last week during a Tasmanian Royal
Commission on the subject a fluoride
consultant to the Department of
Health, Dr. Brothers, rapidly denied
some of the anti’s claims: that fluoride
could affect beer fermentation, make
false teeth brittle, spoil the taste of
tomatoes, etc.
Then he struck back with a cold
statement that in Huonville, Tasmania,
most of the 18-year-olds wear upper
dentures. In fact, said Dr. Brothers, if
a Huonville girl did not have false
teeth at marriage age, she lacked social
status.
Not mentioned, but possibly applic-
able, were a recent statement that beer
had a high fluoride content, and a Tas-
manian ALP decision that the Govern-
ment should reduce the permissible
drinking age to 18.
Concert halls
New plans
IF NOTHING ELSE, Sydney’s Opera
House disputes have provided object
lessons which other States are taking
to heart. Adelaide is to have an all-
purpose Festival Hall on Montefiore
Hill. It will seat 2500 but, former Lord
Mayor Irwin said firmly, “will not be
suitable for grand opera.” Meanwhile
Perth is proposing to t>uild a new con-
cert hall on what were to have been
the local Chevron Hotel foundations.
Now, why didn’t Sydney think of that
first? Building over a deep hole in
the ground which was to have been
Sydney’s Chevron Stage 2, that city
could have had a parking station for
1000 cars with an Opera House on
top and easy access from loges to
lounges next door in Stage 1.
But what is too late for Sydney
does not have to be for Perth, which
is in the ideal situation of having no
concert hall at all. Demolishers are
turning the former Capitol Theatre
into a pile of rubble on which an office
block will rise. The ABC has had to
ask music lovers to trek to Winthrop
Hall at the W.A. University and one
third of its subscribers have declined.
When the Perth City Council stepped*
in, it did so in camera, presumably hav-
ing learned from the Sydney experience
that concert halls are dicy affairs, and
the less known of the early planning the
fewer the recriminations. (It is also
notable at this stage that the City Coun-
cil closed its architecture department
and abolished its city architect.)
The Council decided not to build a
concert hall on the town-planned site
adjoining, its 1962 Council House, but
to ask for the 2-acre Chevron site
The Sydney Chevron today


on St. George’s Terrace, there to build
both a Town Hall and a larger, modern
concert hall.
It said it would pay for the Town
Hall but expected the W.A. Government
to help pay for the concert hall. (It
might also, sensibly, expect the ABC to
help influence some funds from the
Federal Arts Council, if that is ever
formed.)
Other considerations could speed the
project. Perth values its tourists as
much as any city, and may realise that
there is no speedier way for a capital
to become an interstate backwater than
to fail to lay out all the attractions
visitors are used to at home, even if
these are more to be seen than used.
Should Perth decide to follow Syd-
ney to the next planning stage, the con-
test for a concert-hall design, we can
suggest that unless Perth wants to spend
SSO million on a building designed to
look like a swan, Rottnest Island, or
even a hill of solid iron ore, the win-
ning design would have the City Coun-
cil extend its Council House over the
site first planned for a concert hall
and call the new building Town Hall.
And then not only build its concert
hall on St. George’s Terrace but also a
Chevron Hotel adjoining it. Appreci-
ative tourists, slipping across for relief
from a dull orchestral movement, or
even to take a room for the night after
an exhausting concert, would admit that
this was something the Sydney Opera
House could not rival.
Airways
Under-26
SINCE IT WAS agreed at the last
International Airlines Conference that
young people under 26 could fly from
Australia to Europe or vice versa for
$390, an advertising war has broken
out between BOAC and Qantas.
Qantas has been using, full-page
advertisements inviting “pacesetters” to
fly with them. Stepping from the plane
is a casual little girl in sandals and
bobble earrings with the wind in her
hair, and behind her shoulder two
fellows staring haughtily from behind
dark glasses. So well have Qantas done
their job that many young people think
that the whole idea is theirs, and have
rushed to make bookings, either on a
credit system (10 percent down and
the rest in easy instalments) or as a
lay-by.
BOAC responded with a lavish poster
bearing a pile of short-skirted girls
setting the pace in a Mini-moke with
a group of presumably off-duty Guards-
men looking on. The poster came to
life in Sydney a couple of weeks ago
and the Mini-moke, complete with
BOAC’s under-26 campaign in Sydney
girls and bowler-hatted fellows, went
through the streets scattering pamphlets
about BOAC like manna to th.e people.
BOAC had a “lot of inquiries.”
Other airlines are not so keen to
publicise the fact that young air fares
are down because the under-26 brigade
must be furnished with Australian or
New Zealand passports, and German,
Italian, and Indian lines don’t want to
upset their own nationals by not being
able to offer the same largesse.
The scheme seems very sound. The
fare is the same from any capital city
in Australia to any part of Europe. The
time set down for travelling is naturally
enough the off-peak period, from June
to October going toward Europe, and
from April to August on the way back.
Two stops can be made en route,
one in the East and one in Europe,
so that young adventurers can disem-
bark for any period up to one year
from the time they bought the ticket.
They can actually buy their return
ticket before leaving Australia, provided
they will still be under 26 on the way
back. The price is $230 below the
normal economy air fare and equivalent
to the price of a very ordinary passage
by sea. There are certain stipulations
not more than 20 kilos of luggage
and a minimum of two airlines only
to be involved in the chopping and
changing at the Eastern and European
stopovers.
Qantas are going into the thing with
great verve and are running a nation-
wide contest to find 20 ideal pace-
setters for the first trip in June. The
lucky youngsters who have raised money
enough for the Spastic Centre, and
some of whom may also in their
delirium have entered the Miss Aus-
tralia Quest, will have several days in
Hong Kong and Amsterdam, and the
first week in London paid for. Already
a man from Qantas has been to

Agriculture
Sheep and B '
“DO YOUR SHEEP star-gaze?” asks
the latest news bulletin from Vic-
toria’s Department of Agriculture, and
what seems at first glance a frivolous
question turns out to be an important
one to the industry. Sheep, we learn,
do assume a star-gazing position,- muzzle
pointing to the sky, when stricken with
polioencephalomalacia, in which brain
damage occurs. It is almost a world-
wide sheep disease, and latest research
in Britain suggests it might be caused
by a vitamin B 1 (thiamine) deficiency,
although in experiments it has been
induced by other substances than anti-
thiamine.
The Victorian department says it is
suspected of causing considerable
economic loss, with an incidence vary-
ing from one or two rare cases to as
much as 20 percent of a flock. This is
less so in some other States, although
drought conditions have brought more
cases. Victoria has asked its graziers
to report quickly when they have
affected sheep, because a measure of
the mineral content in the blood could
be valuable in research.

MARLEY
TOTHE
RESCUE.
Modern industry must have water to survive. Millions
of gallons of it. An endless flow of pure fresh water,
every hour, every day. But surely all this water must
run out sometime? That's where Marley comes to the
rescue. Marley Cooling Towers throughout Australia
are saving water for industry. Water that can be
re-used ove.r and over again. In fact the figure is a
staggering 2.5 million gallons saved per minute. That's
a lot of water. And that's one more reason you should
look to Email-Marley for your next cooling tower.

"It's a political trick to discredit Bobby Kennedy."
COMMENT
The Opera House: fair goes, or give-it-a-go?
IT IS PROBABLY true that the only
sensible thing to do about the construc-
tion of the Sydney Opera House, now
that there seems to be a final decision
about what it is to be used for, is to
wait and see what sort of a job they
make of it. However much one may
be dissatisfied with the decision, discus-
sion time can now be more fruitfully
used in trying to see to it that the
Opera House adds something to Aus-
tralia, not merely as a building (which
it undoubtedly will do) but as an
activity.
It is almost unbelievable that the par-
ticular question of what is going to
happen in the Opera House, what it
is going to be used for, has not only
not yet been decided but not yet
even been fully discussed. We know
that the ABC will book the music hall
for a certain number of concerts a year
and that it will use the music and
recording theatre. And that’s all we
do know. What happens to the concert
hall for the rest of the year? What hap-
pens in the minor hall? The drama
theatre? The experimental theatre?
The cinema? The chamber music
theatre? And, equally important, what
liaison is being established with the
Melbourne Culture Centre so that,
where it is appropriate, seasons can
be extended over at least two cities?
It is not suggested that the State
Government should sit down and work
all this out themselves. Heaven forbid.
They have already sensibly invited an
English expert to report on it for them.
Whose reactions should they get to his
report? Hardly the Opera House Trust.
This body is now utterly discredited
and might well be sacked.
Since the activities of the Melbourne
Culture Centre are important to Syd-
ney’s Opera House (and vice versa), a
good start might be for an evaluating
committee taken from both New South
Wales and Victoria to explore areas of
common interest. And since the Federal
Government is already involved in sub-
sidies and, according to rumour, is likely
to become more heavily involved, it
would seem sensible for there to be
some direct liaison with them as well.
The essential requirements of com-
mittee members would be the ability to
evaluate alternatives and make recom-
mendations.
Around any group of people making
these recommendations there will be a
continuing grind of barrow-pushers, and
whatever recommendations are made
will be greeted with more boos than
cheers. It is inevitable that some good
ideas will be knocked back and that
some good causes will be lost. The final
recommendations will be attacked as
expressions of favoritism. And so, in
one sense, they must be. That is what
decision-making is about. For that
matter, favoritism has been one of the
devices by which the arts sometimes
flourish. Our national insistence that
everyone should have a fair go is fine
as a general human principle, but not
only is it impossible to carry out in
subsidising the arts; if it were possible
to carry it out it might end up doing
mere harm than good.
It might be argued that it is neces-
sary for the Opera House to have its
own theatre company. If this argument
seemed convincing this might mean that
other companies might miss out on some
of the future subsidy money. This is
unfortunate for them. On the other
hand only a concentration of resources
might produce the right result. Perhaps
not. There is no finality in decision-
making. We are said to have another
national characteristic and that is the
idea of give-it-a-go. It is time we
reached conclusions on plans for using
the Opera House and then give them
a go.

HOLT
IN
ASM
One of the most successful changes
Mr. Harold Holt has brought to the
Prime Ministership is that he is try-
ing to dramatise Australia’s relation
to the nations of Asia. The tour
that he begins this week further
establishes that relation. It does
more: by the combination of coun-
tries he is visiting — not only
neutralist Cambodia and Laos, but
also highly “committed 33 South
Korea and Nationalist China — he
displays some of the tolerance and
subtlety in Australian foreign policy
that are as little known to many of
its supporters as they are to its
critics.

HOLT IN ASIA —1
SINGAPORE
SINGAPORE is only a stopover on the
Prime Minister’s tour, but it deserves a
special place in the Australian imagina-
tion. Singapore is a city-State, and
Australia is the most citified nation in
the world. The people of Singapore are
of immigrant origin: so are Australians.
Singaporeans see the,mselves as tough,
resourceful, and adaptable: so do Aus-
tralians. And both Singapore and Aus-
tralia are devoted to the goals of
material progress for every person.
But while Australia is the world’s
largest island, appended to the Malay
Archipelago but not part of it, the
small island of Singapore is linked by
a causeway and a pipeline of fresh
water to Malaysia and the furthermost
islands of Indonesia are only a few
miles from its famous harbor. Though
committed to the ideal that diverse
races can live together in tolerance
and with common purpose, Singapore
is largely a Chinese city, embedded in
a part of the world that is predomin-
antly rural and Malay, hating the
Chinese and distrusting the ways of
cities. Despite a successful birth-con-
trol campaign that will halve the birth
rate by 1970, Singapore’s population
upthrust may already be pushing be-
yond its capacity to find employment.
A perilously large part of its prosperity
comes from the British base and fro.m
procurements to Vietnam. Its use
as an entrepot port by Malaysia and
Indonesia was lessened by the Con-
frontation with Indonesia and the
Separation from Malaysia. It pushes
forward into manufacturing, but whereas
in Hong Kong skills and money
migrated from Shanghai and started all
over again, the traditions of the Chinese
in Singapore are mainly commercial.
Yet Singaporeans bustle with im-
provisations. They are selling black
face powder to Africans. They are
sending missions to Eastern European
countries to suggest that they now make
Singapore their eastern port. They
have attracted the interest of many of
the nations of Africa and Asia in their
survival. -
Self-concern with survival has pro-
duced a special shimmering brilliance
in political leadership: Lee Kuan-yew’s
PAP Government must be the most
quick-witted in the world, using the
instruments of intelligence as the cut-
ting edge of power, quick on the draw,
with a counter-threat ready for any
threat. Despite its progressiveness, the
PAP faces no opposition from the
Right: the Singapore Right seems to
have been dazzled out of existence. To
Singapore’s Lee Kuan-yew.
the Left the PAP acts with a calculated
and knowledgeable toughness, shattering
Peking influence and jumping on the
main Left-wing party, weakened since
its apparently pro-Indonesian stand dur-
ing the Confrontation. The PAP flashes
so brightly over Singapore that some
of its critics seem to be complaining
that it does not provide its own Opposi-
tion.
There is an heroic quality in Singa-
pore politics, possible in the uncertain-
ties of the Malay Archipelago, that
sometimes almost seems to be pursued
for its own sake, ennobling the imagina-
tion by struggle. But this pushing to-
ward the rational and the modern as
ideals could always affront the kind
of Chinese chauvinism, still endemic in
Singapore, in which some Singaporeans
are more proud to be Chinese than to
be modern. If economic growth fell
off, being Chinese might seem an im-
portant consolation, perhaps with a
special consolation in the importance
of Peking.
For this reason, if for no other,
what happens to Singapore is important
to Australians. But beyond self-interest
there are even better reasons. Through-
out the Malay Archipelago the immi-
grant Chinese are distrusted: in In-
donesia most savagely, in the Philippines
with an economic vindictiveness, in
Malaysia more mildly. In Singapore,
where they are the majority, they have
thrown up an exceptionally efficient
community. As fellow immigrants we
should have a special interest in their
prosperity and survival.

CAMBODIA
TO CAMBODIANS there are threats
from both East and West, but “East”
and “West” in the Cambodian con-
sciousness are not Communism and
Capitalism, but Thailand and Vietnam,
historic enemies, bent on the division
of the Cambodians before the imposed
peace of the European colonialists saved
them. As elsewhere in South-East Asia
the sense of neighborhood, and its hos-
tilities, overrides more global concerns.
That America was the ally of both
Thailand and South Vietnam almost in
itself made it inevitable that Cam-
bodia’s Prince Sihanouk, proud, sensi-
tive, subtle, brilliant, should become
anti-American, turning to Peking in
a deal in which, although proclaiming
friendship with China, he is free to
control his own Communists and at
least gain for Cambodians a tempor-
ary peace while others fight it out.
In Cambodia nothing is black and
white. China paid the bill for the
Games of the New Emerging Forces
(GANEFO) held in Phnom Penh last
year to outdo the “imperialist”. Asian
Games held in Bangkok. But beneath
announcements for the Games there ran
the slogan “Come Alive with Pepsi.”
While Sihanouk greeted the Games as
an example of “the solidarity of those
who oppose the monstrous ambitions of
the American imperialists,” he also
said that “the Red gentlemen should
not take others for monkeys or puppets
or humiliate, me too much, for they
must know that Sihanouk is not inferior
to them, even though they hold univer-
sity degrees.” In the one week he pro-
claimed both that “in the future Cam-
bodia will apply a Communist system
so as to develop more quickly” and
that “Cambodia must take the national-
ist and Buddhist path and not the line
set forth by Stalin, Mao Tse-tung,
Lenin, Karl Marx, or Engels.”
In Phnom Penh the tourist walks
along the grassy bank of the Mekong
or the wide, tree-lined boulevardes the
French built, or shops or eats in the
smart, gay streets shaded with striped
awnings, and finds a relaxation now
missing from many Asian cities. But
there are clouds. Sihanouk so,metimes
speaks of Chinese dominance; deficit
budgeting shows a sagging economy;
attempts at “socialism” result mainly in
high prices. Sihanouk’s Right Wing
presses him to restore relations with the
Americans, severed in 1965, to provide
support for the 30,000-man army that
cannot defend Cambodia’s borders
against threats from Thailand and
South Vietnam; his Left Wing applauds
protests against American bombing and
ground attacks near the South Vietnam
border. Everyone is angry that even the
Viet Cong will not sign a border agree-
ment.
In this situation, with predictable un-
Cambodia’s Prince Sihanouk
predictability, Sihanouk called for
Western-style elections for the National
Assembly. Confounding most of the
prophets, the elections produced a
Right-wing landslide in which Conser-
vatives won nearly three-quarters of the
seats. When a Conservative Govern-
ment was formed, Sihanouk, as part of
his continuing balancing of factions, set
up a “counter-government,” calling it
“Her Majesty’s Opposition.” (The
Prince’s mother holds the nominal title
of Queen.) He appointed an opposition
shadow cabinet to provide “semi-official,
constructive opposition” and to “make
suggestions, criticise, and when appro-
priate commend the Government.”
The measure of Australia’s friendship
for Cambodia is that, as well as repre-
senting the Americans in Phnom Penh,
we represent the Cambodians in Saigon,
Our two Governments respect their dif-
ferences in attitude toward the Ameri-
cans, the Chinese, the Thais, and the
Vietnamese so successfully that Austra-
lia is probably the most popular
“Western” nation in Cambodia, a re-
freshing sign of the ability to find and
pursue .mutual interest even when, on
external matters, policies differ. As
Sihanouk says: “Our two countries
offer to the world an eloquent example
of success in peaceful and friendly co-
existence of nations which have made
very different options in the external
field.” Next page, please

LAOS
IMAGINE LAOS. Imagine two main
areas where the Communist-led Pathet
Lao is in control the northern
provinces where only hill tribesmen
oppose their rule and American air-
craft hop from mountain to mountain
dropping supplies, and the south-east
provinces through which run the web of
roads, rivers, and jungle paths that
make up the Ho Chi Minh trail, where
20,000 or so North Vietnamese soldiers
guard the 50,000 or so North Viet-
namese porters and coolies who run
the guns to the Viet Cong, harassed
only occasionally by American bomb-
ing.
Imagine the rest of Laos, where the
Pathet Lao has been reduced to only
tiny pockets of influence . . . the lords
of provinces contend for power, and
generals make fortunes from opium,
gold, and American aid ... in the
overgrown township that makes up the
capital of Vientiane, factions squabble
with plot and counter-plot . . . the
budget is almost all deficit.
On the face of it, hopeless. Yet Laos
is one of the symbols of hope. Lrozen
into the shapes that it held when the
Geneva Agreement of 1962 was signed,
frozen as arbitrarily as water freezes
into the shapes it holds when the tem-
perature drops, it now shows how
contending powers can at least let
things be in one area while they still
contend in another. Not only the
Russians and the Americans are ready
to stand easy in Laos: Hanoi and Peking
seem equally prepared to let things
stay as they are while issues are decided
instead in the two Vietnams.
When the Geneva Agreement was
signed, the idea that Laos would be
neutral was laughed at by those who
had read their text books on Com-
munism. In one sense they were right.
Laos is not neutral: it is simply divided,
although in a fuzzy kind of way. In
another sense the critics were pro-
foundly wrong: Pathet Lao influence
has been contracted to its own provinces.
Communists can also know when to
hold back. In the meantime, the
Budget deficits decline and what,
according to normal rules, should have
been economic collapse has not
occurred. The Loreign Exchange Oper-
ations Lund sustains the Laotian
economy, allowing it to recover from
its own ravages, and France (of all
nations) co-operates with America,
Britain, Japan, and Australia in help-
ing to make it so.
In the middle of the bits and pieces
Laos’ Souvanna Phouma
of the country of which he is the ruler,
Prince Souvanna Phouma, one of the
able men of South-East Asia, constructs
here and there the coalitions of in-
terest that might later coalesce into a
sense of cohesiveness. With American
encouragement he is eliminating the
extreme Right-wing groups who earlier
tried to kill him and who wish to
break the fictions of neutrality and
perhaps thereby bring down on their
country the disasters of Vietnam. With
the cautious determination of one who
is not unnerved by the distractions of
disorder he knits together factions from
the Right and the Centre so that in
some happier future all Laos might
have one government and one army,
Not many important people from
other countries visit Vientiane, but im-
portant Australians do, and Mr. Holt
is the most important of them. His visit
will help to make it believable that
Laos’ friends are concerned with its
survival, a demonstration of purpose
necessary not only to Laos but to
neighboring Thailand. His visit also
demonstrates, as does his visit to Cam-
bodia, that to Australia there is not
one simple dogmatic solution to the
political problems of South-East Asia,

TAIWAN
TO AN EXTRAORDINARY degree
Taiwan brings out the intemperate in
both its opponents and its supporters
so that their talk balloons out into
ludicrous exaggerations of all-good or
all-bad. These exaggerations are per-
haps a continuing reflection of the
excessive deflation of the world image
of President Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang
was seen at first as a world hero, the
defender of Free China against the
Japanese, his face shining in wartime
propaganda displays along with the
faces of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin.
Then, as Americans first began to dis-
cover that, in the manner of Asian
regimes, Chiang’s regime was corrupt
and inefficient, Chiang’s image blew
up and for many he became the prize
devil of reaction and corruption. When
his government fell to pieces in
its attempt to control a China liberated
from the Japanese and at the same
time to resist Mao Tse-tung’s armies,
he was treated with the contempt that
historians accord to the defeated.
Even after his long exile with his
government in Taiwan it is still unbe-
lievable to many of his critics that,
apart from Japan (and admittedly a
long way behind it), Taiwan is the
one area in Asia where there has been
a genuinely thorough rural reform,
with peasant ownership and rising
prosperity and that, again apart from
Japan (which in economic terms is
not “Asian” at all), it is the one area
to achieve self-sustaining economic
growth, maintaining one of the highest
growth rates in the world, with an
excellent local investment of savings and
- since 1965 —no American aid.
But Chiang’s eyes still gaze across the
water to the mainland. His government
still considers itself to be the govern-
ment of the Republic of China and it is
still nominally recognised as such, by
majority vote, in the United Nations;
by its legal forms Taiwan is a mere
province, even if it happens to be the
only province this government controls.
The ideology of Chiang’s return-to-the-
mainland is so strongly embedded that
merely to criticise it is illegal; for the
past 17 years it has been the official
sustaining belief of the exiles that their
return to their homeland might occur
any week now. At times they dream of
military invasion; at other times of a
China dissolved again by revolution,
to which they could return as welcome
liberators.
When Mr. Holt arrives in Taipei he
will be thanked for extending Aus-
Taiwan's Chiang Kai-shek.
tralia’s diplomatic recognition of
Chiang’s government to the extent of
actually appointing an ambassador, an
act from which Sir Robert Menzies
curiously refrained. But he is also
likely to be criticised for recognising
the Government of Mongolia. Chiang’s
Nationalists are still touchy on such
questions. In their sustaining myth of
return-to-the-mainland they do not
want to lose any of what they see as
their inheritance, and to them Mongolia
is part of China.
How much longer will the govern-
ment in Taiwan go on acting as if it is
the government of all China? Certainly
as long as Chiang lives. After that?
One cannot answer the question. Many
of even the second-generation main-
landers, the children of those who re-
treated to Taiwan after Mao’s victory,
see Taiwan as only a place of refuge
and the Taiwanese as mere provincials.
The parliament that sits in Taipei
and gives the government its legitimacy
was elected in China many years ago:
its members are dying; they cannot be
replaced because in theory they repre-
sent all China and there can be no
new elections.
The question will finally be settled
outside Taiwan in the relations
existing between the powers, particu-
larly China and America, and in
decisions in the United Nations. Neither
the government in Peking nor the-
government in Taipei will at present
envisage a “two - China” policy, with
both of them sitting in the United
Nations. Peking policy is simply that
it should take Taiwan over. But it is
unimaginable that America would ever
agree to abandon a community which,
whatever tensions may lie concealed
beneath its surface, is clearly deter-
mined to resist the methods of Maoism.

SOUTH KOREA
IN THE UNITED NATIONS duty
officers’ hut in the demilitarised zone
between South Korea and North Korea
there is an American telephone, stream-
lined and “contemporary,” a Russian
telephone, rococo and Tsarist. When the
Americans want to ring the North
Koreans in their duty officers’ hut a
few yards away they use the American
telephone. When the North Koreans
want to ring the Americans the call
comes through on the Russian tele-
phone. In this handful of huts set in
the middle of a dead battlefield the
confrontation between the two sides is
carried out with the elaborate detail
of a minuet. When both sides meet
formally in the Military Armistice
Commission Hut they play a game of
complaint and counter-complaint, delib-
erately seeking triviality. The furniture
in the hut was put together haphaz-
ardly, to provide somewhere to sit to
discuss an armistice; it now looks
like a museum exhibit, cast into history
in a part of the world where the Cold
War is still frostbitten. In the United
Nations duty officers’ hut they point
proudly to the graph that shows tourist
attendances in the zone. “We had more
than 30,000 tourists last year,” says an
American officer. “This year it will be
even better.”
Behind the protection of the formali-
ties of the demilitarised zone, of United
States support, and of their own Army
one of the biggest second biggest
armies in the world the South
Korean Government is proud of the
statistics of economic growth. Exports
are up, manufacturing is up, infrastruc-
ture is up. Even if much of it is up from
nothing, it is a remarkable achieve-
ment. “MODERNISATION OF THE
FATHERLAND BY 1981” is the
Government’s slogan. However, despite
a land reform made possible by sharing
out former Japanese holdings, the im-
provement of rural life lags behind in-
dustrial growth, and there are some
signs that the Government is so con-
cerned with food production statistics
that it is ignoring those questions of
social justice in the villages without
which progress in a nation loses mean-
ing. But after the ravages of war and
disorder the quality of life is improv-
ing everywhere, and Seoul is that rare
thing a city in an undeveloped
society that works efficiently as a city.
In South Korea anti-Americanism is
a crime, taken to be synonymous with
pro-Communism. This harshness seems
unnecessary. Despite their massive in-
fluence, the Americans tread softly in
Korea. American troops spend their rest
and recreation leave in pleasure spots
out of town, not affronting or corrupt-
ing with their prosperity: even the motor
South Korea's President Park
traffic is restrained and modest, with-
out the flashy limousines that screech
privilege in other Asian cities. In Korea
to be anti-colonial means not to be anti-
European but to be anti-Japanese; un-
like some of the more hastily assembled
Asian nations, there is a workable sense
of cohesive nationalism.
But it is mainly the nationalism of
hostility to the oppressor. First the
Japanese, against whom it first grew,
then the invading Communists. Now,
in Korean propaganda, the 45,000-man
Korean contingent in South Vietnam
appears to be fighting a patriotic war.
Like other nations in Asia, Korea sees
itself as an initiator of new groupings
between peoples and as a bridge be-
tween East and West. Behind official
rhetoric it has something of a Bona-
partist system of government: Presi-
dent Park was elected by the people
(narrowly), but he acts as the em-
bodiment of the people and rules
authoritatively. The parliament pro-
vides some vehicle for criticism: per-
haps the biggest corrective, as in other
Asian nations, are the students. They
toppled Syngman Rhee, providing Park’s
first avenue to power; Park’s Demo-
cratic Republican Party must continue
to take them into account. If the weakly
organised parties that oppose Park can
agree to put up a single candidate they
might defeat him, if not in this election,
then the next.
Meanwhile, the Democratic Repub-
lican Party is the only strongly organ-
ised party in Korea. General Kim
Chong-pil, the head of the party, was
previously head of the Korean CIA
and this CIA still penetrates deeply,
leading to an oppressive uncertainty
and caginess in ordinary life. (The
American CIA is constantly accused
of supporting anti-Park elements.) Like
the other nations Mr. Holt will visit,
South Korea does not enjoy effective
two-party government. Nor, in the last
18 years, has Australia.


Our way...and Theirs
Here is a comparison of the financial treatment of Australian and
American soldiers fighting in Vietnam. All figures are in Australian dollars.
AUSTRALIAN PAY
The base rate of pay for an Australian private is $4.87
per day. The base rate for a sergeant is $6.31; for a
warrant-officer, $7.69; for a second lieutenant, $7.88; and
for a colonel, $22.33.
Australian allowances per day: Marriage allowance, $1.72;
clothing allowance, $0.28; Vietnam Zone allowance, $1.55
(ranks), $1.70 (officers).
AUSTRALIAN INSURANCE
Servicemen who take out insurance after being posted
to battle zones pay high premiums. Difficulties have been
found in gaining insurance with many companies and the
cover is usually no more than $6OOO. The Government is
now working with insurance companies to devise more
adequate insurance cover.
AUSTRALIAN REHABILITATION
The Federal Government last year began a scheme
to train men who are leaving the Services in trades of civilian
use. There is no special provision for training regular
servicemen after they leave. National Servicemen may apply
for post-discharge vocational training. Full-time training will
be offered in colleges, universities, or approved institutions
for one year with all fees paid and financial assistance equal
to the basic wage. Part-time training will be assisted for
two years.
AUSTRALIAN PENSIONS
Totally and permanently incapacitated pensions are at
the rate of $30.50 per week. Widows of servicemen killed in
Vietnam, $l3 per week; first child, $3.90; other children,
$2.75 each. An additional pension of $7 per week is pay-
able to widows with children under sixteen, and in certain
other cases.
AUSTRALIAN LOANS
War Service Home loans are available to a maximum of
$7OOO at 3| percent over 45 years. A re-establishment loan is
available to some discharged National Servicemen for pur-
poses such as purchasing or leasing land, premises, or a busi-
ness, or improving land, or purchasing tools of trade or stock.
The limits for agricultural loans is $6OOO, for others $3OOO.
OTHER BENEFITS
Medical assistance may be given to ex-servicemen or their
surviving dependants through the Repatriation Department.
Educational benefits are also available to the children
of ex-servicemen who have been killed or severly injured
on active service.
AMERICAN PAY
The base rate of pay for an American private is $2.91
per day. The base rate for a sergeant is $6.01; for a warrant-
officer, $8.95; for a second lieutenant, $12.61; and for a
colonel, $21.11.
American allowances per day: Family separation allowance
(for those with more than four years of service), $0.90;
clothing allowance, $0.20; hostile fire pay, $1.66; incentive
pay (for specially hazardous operations), $1.66 (ranks),
$3.32 (officers).
AMERICAN INSURANCE
The U.S. Government arranges insurance for every
serviceman to the sum of $9,000 on intake. The payments
are heavily subsidised by the U.S. Treasury. President
Johnson recently announced that the Government will soon
raise the minimum insurance cover to $lO,BOO and assist
in subsidies to provide insurance coverage up to $27,000.
Servicemen will be expected to contribute only 18 cents a
month for every $9OO cover in the first $lO,BOO, and on a
higher scale for higher amounts.
AMERICAN REHABILITATION
For each month of service American servicemen of all
classes are offered a month’s financial assistance to a limit
of 36 months toward school, college, university, or trade
training. The rates of payment this year will be $ll7
per month for a married man with no dependants, $135 for
a married man with one child. This rate increases by $9- for
each additional child. Ex-servicemen pay their own fees
from this grant.
AMERICAN PENSIONS
The TPI rate is $22.50 per week; widows, $14.40; first
child, $8.55. In addition, pensions higher than those for
widows are payable to dependent parents of servicemen killed
in Vietnam. The President recently announced his intention
to increase these payments by 4 percent to 6 percent.
AMERICAN LOANS
The Government will guarantee loans for the purchase
of a house or farm up to $6750 at 5f percent over 30
years. In special cases this limit is extended to $15,750.
OTHER BENEFITS
Medical and educational benefits operate under conditions
similar to those in Australia. An extra benefit offered by
the United States Government is an automobile grant of
$1440 to veterans of combat with special disabilities.

Alcan puts ideas into aluminium and
fast acting pain killers stay fresh longer...

Disprin is made highly soluble to dissolve
quickly. To protect each and every tablet is
important—and Reckitt & Colman, manufac-
turers of Disprin, called in Alcan to meet
the challenge.
The answer was a strip-pack made from
Alcan aluminium foil. Why foil . . . because
being a thin sheet of metal, aluminium
foil is the perfect barrier to ensure
protection—the sort of protection that keeps
products factory fresh.
Only Alcan strip-packaging foil could
efficiently seal Disprin to withstand
atmospheric variations and prolong
shelf life—impossible with existing bottles
and tubes. After rigorous testing Reckitt
& Colman considered Alcan's strip-pack
equal if not better to any in the world.
Result: improved packaging efficiency. Now
Disprin stays fresh on the bathroom shelf
indefinitely, and can be carried conveniently
in pocket or purse.
Just one of the many ways Alcan puts ideas
into aluminium—and makes the world a
slightly easier place for man to live in,
even when he has a headache.

What’s happening
to our great
Australian apathy
By BETTY MOFFAT
FAINT HOPEFUL BREEZES stir our
old Australian apathy. Are we leaving
behind for ever our unique social-
radical anchorage to plot a parallel
course with the United States? Politics
at all levels suddenly seem to be swim-
ming up in clearer, brighter op-art
symbols than the erstwhile respectable
old colonial chiaroscuro and trade-
union slate-blues.
After three years in America, a
montage of memories of the American
political scene is still flashing past me
. . . the towering Peking-style portraits
of LBJ at the Democratic National
Convention in Atlantic City . . .
Southern Negroes clustered on the
boardwalk singing beneath a bronze bust
of John Kennedy . . . Goldwater fan-
atics, with gilt-powdered hair, domin-
ating the San Francisco Republican
Convention . . . Bobby Kennedy briefly
shaking my hand at a Long Island rally,
disconcerting with his harsh, hypnotic
glance . . . Menzies lumbering pinkly in
his big, blue double-breasted suit
through the White House garden, gal-
lantly trying to be nice to LBJ and his
dogs . . .
Arthur Calwell once suggested sweep-
ing changes to the Australian Consti-
tution to provide for a president and
U.S.-style committees to counteract the
growing power of our parliamentary
executive. Holt and Whitlam perhaps
don’t yet contemplate such sweeping
changes. But there is certainly a faint,
far-off sound of revolutionary bugles as
the Australian political structure enters
its prosperous, perilous, Pan-Pacific era.
Cyril Wyndham, Federal secretary of
the Australian Labor Party, told me:
“We’re already adopting some U.S.
campaigning trends. Last year the
Queensland Young Labor Association
used go-go girls, attractively dressed
and featuring the Queensland Labor
Party’s red sash. They drew a couple
of thousand young people at a Sunday
afternoon function. However, American
politicians are often independently rich
men who can finance their own cam-
paigns, apart from using party funds.
Meanwhile, here in Australia, the cost
of electioneeering is getting out of hand
completely.”
John Carrick, the N.S.W. Liberal
Party secretary, has reservations' about
the carnival element creeping into Aus-
tralian politics! “Would music and
dancing girls or marching girls
necessarily mean more intelligent in-
terest in politics? You’d probably have
to brand me a square because I don’t
necessarily think it’s a cause-effect. I’m
against noise that drowns out ideas
after all that’s what political parties
are supposed to be doing, communicat-
ing ideas but if there are pleasant,
entertaining ways of public communica-
tion, let’s have them. Let there be in-
terjections and questions ■ — these are
the life blood of politics but if
entertainment is going to enter politics,
let it be a means and not an end in
itself.”
Garrick acknowledged other external
political similarities to the U.S.: “These
days in Australia you can’t pick a
Labor voter on his ‘status’ any more,
just as over there you can’t tell a
Democrat from a Republican by look-
ing at him. Perhaps it can be best
summed up with the Kennedy impact.
That was something special. I don’t
apologise for saying that the history
of our Western progress has been an
upward struggle for things. When we
had a job, enough to eat, we were
always told, then mankind would start
being happy. We’d have arrived. And
then, comparatively, anyhow, we had
arrived and we weren’t happy. Material
well-being apparently wasn’t doing the
trick. And then Kennedy came and
pointed the way beyond material
affluence to goals of the spirit and
mind. This, anyhow, I feel, was his
great appeal.”
Parallels between the United States
and Australia begin with our equal
claim to the “European Fragment”
theory, now popular among comparative
historians. We too, along with Latin
America, French Canada, Dutch South
Africa, British South Africa, and British
Canada, were fragments struck off from
the larger whole of Europe in the
course of the revolution which brought
the West into the modern world.
Says Louis Hartz in his “The Found-
ing of New Societies”: “When a part
of a European nation is detached from
the whole of it and hurled outward on
to new soil, it loses the stimulus
toward change that the whole provides.
It lapses into a kind of immobility.
The fragments reflect every phase of
European revolution, but they evince
alike the immobilities of fragmentation.
Moreover, they are involved alike, be-
cause of this, in one of the strangest
issues of change that the world im-
pact of the modern era has produced.”
Hartz claims that the very Western
revolution from which these fragments
originally fled now confronts them,
centuries later and from wholly un-
expected angles (“from places as dis-
tant as Russia and China”). Our
escape was an illusion, he says, and
all we fragmentary escapees from
Europe are now forced to transcend
the very conservatism which gave us
birth.
It is clear that both America and
Australia are struggling to cope, each
in its way, with internal affluence and
external national resurgence. And just
as Southern racialism can no longer
be tolerated by America, White Aus-
tralia is now a handicap to Australia.
Both of us seem to be discovering the
fact that feelings of uniqueness or
superiority are simply untenable under
the conditions of modern international
relations.
It is possible that Australia’s more
egalitarian nationalism may make the
changeover to co-existence with under-
developed countries more smoothly
achieved, with less of the “rich uncle”
resentment America receives. Maybe
our traditional lack of patriots and
nationalism (to the point where even
now we can’t offer migrants an
Australian national anthem) will make
Pan-Pacific orientation easier.
Curiously enough, Australian nation-
alism suffered because American
nationalism was too victorious. After
the American revolution, Britain took
a much more lenient attitude toward
the colonies. There was such swift
attention to colonial grievances from
Mother England, such willingness to
reform over the protests of entrenched
interests in the colonies, that national-
ism itself was superfluous.
Lack of mass popular participation
in party politics has been a marked
feature of Australian life for all but
a few short periods. Compulsory
voting had to be introduced, not only
to relieve financial burdens on the
parties, but because voter-participation
was dropping dangerously close to the
half-way mark. Only when a straight
two-party system was established
between 1910 and 1917 did Australians


"Americans are faster at remembering
their politicians' names"
vote in the 70 to 80 percent range
common to the United Kingdom and
most West European States. To at
least two-thirds of Australians, politics
is simply a vacancy, an unused space;
they represent, in the evangelical
phrase, the Great Unreached.
The differences in America and Aus-
tralia are that their respective brands
of democracy each became fused with
sharply differing alloys in the forge
of history. While the Horatio Alger
“rags-to-riches” capitalist for the
masses excited American migrants,
Australians, on the other hand, sprang
sore and suspicious from the English
industrial Revolution and from this
evolved an almost sentimental, sacred
militance against privilege.
• Brass bands embarrass us, except
perhaps on Anzac Day, when the Aus-
tralian soldier, frequently admired for
his personal independence and indi-
vidual initiative, feels entitled to Bung
It On a little. The Australian voter,
on the other hand, has been continually
blamed for his lack of initiative and
for his excessive dependence upon the
State.
Americans, although suitably and
within the right context (they feel)
revering their Jesse Jameses and Billy
the Kids, can’t quite see why we ele-
vate our rebels to national heroes. One
American commentator notes that
many Australian radio stations start
daily broadcasting with the playing of
“Waltzing Matilda,” a song which
glorifies the theft of a sheep from a
squatter, and asks: “How many
American stations begin their broad-
casting day with ‘Casey Jones’ or
‘Hallelujah, I’m a Bum’?”
More than one American I met,
however, rather admired this fat and
sassy attitude; underneath the Horatio
Alger syndrome there are many who
would rather welcome “Hallelujah, I’m
a Bum.” More Americans than are
suspected do not take their American-
ism seriously. Look at “Batman” and
the current camp comic - strip craze.
“Serious” Americans, however, feel
we in Australia have turned the admir-
able, earnest Horatio Alger upside
down. Instead of workers looking for-
ward to a golden future as capitalists,
for heaven’s sake, capitalists look
backward with nostalgia to their work-
ing days.
It is unlikely that Australians will
ever make quite such reverent family
pilgrimages to birthplaces of the great
as do Americans. Mount Vernon
(Washington’s splendid old home
crowning the Potomac) and Monti-
cello on a mountain in Virginia, the
gracefully proportioned round house
designed down to its last detail by
Thomas Jefferson, draw as constant a
crowd as does Lenin’s tomb in Moscow.
If we felt we could naturally fit
Ned Kelly into our political scene as
some sort of stirring symbol, this might
make a valid, home-grown start. As
Russel Ward has pointed out in “The
Australian Legend,” our only accept-
able folk myth is the legend of “the
bush.” Here it is interesting to note
that the American national conven-
tions (where the President and Vice-
President are chosen) became noisy,
long-drawn-out circuses because of the
American equivalent of the “bastards
from the bush” hitting the big smoke.
Says Steinbeck in his “America and
Americans”: The business of these
conventions could be concluded in a
very short time, but it is not. For
four or five days it continues, with
parties, celebrations at night, with
great drinking affairs and every kind
of excess known to the American away
from home. The reason for the dura-
tion is obvious but no longer valid:
when the first conventions met most
of the delegates had to ride on horse-
back for days or even weeks to get
to the convention city, and those hard-
riding delegates were not content to
cast their votes and mount their horses
and go home; they wanted some fun,
too; and they still do, even though they
arrive by aeroplane.”
Perhaps we Australians will always
keep our social-radical-egalitarian
brand of democracy; perhaps our more-
British-than-the-British inhibitions (and
who will deny this is true?) will always
make us shy from bullhorns and bunt-
ing, funny hats and drum-majorettes
particularly while we are licking our
pencil stubs and trying to remember
our Members’ names. But there are
those who say that Americans are
faster at remembering their politicians
names.

"I am become DEATH, theshatterer of worlds"
By ROBERT
RAYMOND
The death of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, “father of the atom bomb,” was
marked by a few low-keyed obituaries. They ignored the fact that Oppenheimer’s
active life as a physicist spanned what may yet come to be seen as the crucial
period in the history of homo sapiens.
It Was during the years immediately
after World War I, while politicians
played at putting the world to-
gether again, that the scientists began
to take it apart.
Breathtaking advances in thought
were occurring in tranquil places
the tree-shaded banks of the Cam; the
grassy slopes of Zurich; a picturesque
park in Copenhagen; the Hofgarten in
Munich; the streets around the Pan-
theon in Paris; and, above all, in the
electric atmosphere of the ancient
university town of Gottingen in Ger-
many.
To Gottingen they came from
everywhere, and their names make up
an index to modern physics: Michel-
son, Dirac, Gamow, Wiener, Pauling,
Heisenberg, Fermi, Blackett, Pauli, Tel-
ler. Here, in 1926, there appeared a
slender, rather delicate American
student named J. Robert Oppenheimer,
whose fluency at first impressed and
later irritated his contemporaries. But
he graduated with distinction.
During the ’thirties the centre of
gravity of the world of physics dissi-
pated, scattering to independent
laboratories, some in Germany, some in
Paris, Cambridge, Rome, Copenhagen,
where men were drawing closer to
perhaps the most profoundly significant
discovery in human history. Then, in
December, 1938, after years of baffling
half-knowledge, the fragmented atomic
jigsaw was finally fitted together in a
new pattern, when at the Kaiser Wil-
helm Institute in Berlin Hahn and
Strassman demonstrated that the
uranium nucleus could be split by a
neutron into two parts, together having
less mass than the original nucleus. The
missing mass must go, as Einstein had
calculated years earlier, into energy.
By an accident of history this
momentous discovery was not wel-
comed, as it would once have been, in
the name of progress. The shadow of
war now hung over the small group of
physicists who realised the potential of
this new source of energy.
In the United States, a newly arrived
and unknown Hungarian physicist
named Szilard hastily borrowed a few
thousand dollars, had his equipment
sent from Cambridge, and made some
tests. He found evidence of the neces-
sary neutron emission from uranium
fission. Szilard immediately ap-
proached other physicists in Europe
and in the United States (including
Fermi) to agree to suppress all fur-
ther discoveries about fission and its
implications. He was afraid that the
German Government would discover
how to make an atom bomb.
Suspicion and misunderstanding pre-
vented the refugee scientists from dis-
cussing this fateful matter with their
colleagues still in Germany Harn,
Heisenberg, Wiezsacker. They were
known to be unsympathetic toward
Hitler’s aims but might they not be
persuaded, or coerced? And so the
opportunity passed; a moment when,
as Heisenberg said later, “twelve people
might still have been able, by coming
to mutual agreement, to prevent the
construction of atom bombs.”
Szilard and Teller, another Hun-
garian, enlisted Einstein’s help in
approaching Roosevelt to prevent Ger-
many from getting the largest known
source of uranium, in the Belgian
Congo. No one seemed to realise the
significance of what they were talking
about. Ominous reports came in of
meetings between German scientists
and the military. The British physicists
made calculations to show that a bomb
was entirely feasible.
Szilard and Teller, again using
Einstein (“as a letter-box,” as he put
it later), decided to urge the United
States Government to build the bomb,
in self-defence. But it was not until
1942 that the “Manhattan Project,” a
joint Anglo-American enterprise, got
under way. Ironically, it was based on
a misunderstanding of German plans;
at that stage Hitler scorned all scien-
tists except the rocketeers; his armed
services believed they could win with
what they had; even the scientists them-
selves did not want to make a bomb.
The scientist chosen to supervise the
building of the first atomic bomb was
Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer. At the
University of California and the Cali-
fornia Institute of Technology he had
become a famous and much-admired
figure, a model for the rising genera-
tion of American physicists. And yet,
it seems, he was dissatisfied with him-
self. His publications, though impec-
cable, broke no new ground. He seemed
frustrated at having failed to match
the original creative physics of his con-
temporaries, Fermi, Dirac, Heisenberg.
Many of Opp>-iheimer’s later atti-
tudes, during the “crises of conscience”
that were to imbroil all those scientists
concerned with the bomb, may perhaps
be traced to this background of in-
tellectual frustration, the hunger to
prove something to himself.
At a site suggested by him - a
rustic boarding school at a place
called Los Alamos in the wilds of
New Mexico, where he had gone to
school as a boy Oppenheimer set
in motion the march of events that,
beginning so slowly, was to become
the nuclear arms race. But even as
he began to direct the growing horde
of scientists (described by General
Groves, director of the Manhattan
Project, as “the largest collection of
crackpots ever seen”) trouble was blow-
ing up.
During the ’thirties Oppenheimer
had, like many others, been interested
in Left-wing politics and had inevitably
come in contact with many avowed
Communists. After his appointment
to Los Alamos, but before it had been
confirmed, U.S. Army counter-intelli-
gence agents watched him closely for
evidence of continued Communist
sympathies. A visit he paid to a girl
he had once nearly married an
unashamed Communist sympathiser
was reported to Washington, with a
recommendation of his dismissal, as a
potential security risk. General Groves,
however, was so anxious to get the
bomb built that he used his authority
to have Oppenheimer issued with a
security clearance.
While the Manhattan Project got
under w'ay Oppenheimer had done
something which he later admitted was
“idiotic,” and which finally caught up
with him. He had made up a story
about an approach to scientists at Los
Alamos by a Russian agent, naming
one of his friends as the intermediary.
In fact, the attempt had been made
to reach Oppenheimer himself, and it
was his friend wdio had warned him
about it. His friend was discredited and
had to leave the country, not knowing
that Oppenheimer was responsible. It
was the disclosure of this sordid story,
not any accusation of disloyalty on
Oppenheimer’s part, that caused the
withdrawal of his security clearance
in 1954.
Meanwhile, with Oppenheimer’s team
still driven by the fear that Germany
might be ahead in the race, the bomb
was slowly assembled. By the end of
1944 success was in sight when a
sudden development faced the scien-
tists with a dilemma as crucial as the
one they had faced (and shied away
from) in 1939. In November the Ameri-
can Army captured Strasbourg. At the
Physics Institute, in Wiezsacker’s
abandoned office, they found a com-
plete description of Germany’s work
with uranium. These papers proved con-
clusively that Germany was nowhere
near to making an atomic bomb.
To many at Los Alamos and else-
where it now seemed that the pre-
mise upon which they had begun the
bomb was no longer valid; the only
remaining enemy, Japan, was clearly
incapable of threatening the Allies
with such a weapon. Others, however
(including Oppenheimer), felt that the
work should be completed, as a mat-
ter of scientific achievement. In any
case, they argued, continuation was
justified by the peaceful promise of
nuclear power. The momentum®
engendered by the combined efforts
of 150,000 people, and the expenditure
of two billion dollars, carried the day.
General Groves ordered a study group
to select targets in Japan for the bomb.
One of the group was Oppenheimer;
the four target cities were chosen.
Now Szilard, who perhaps more than
any single man had started the whole
train of events, tried to stuff the genie
back into the bottle. Again he turned
to Einstein. Again Einstein lent his
name and prestige to an appeal to
the President. He felt, he said, that
the original motives of the scientists
had been “betrayed.” His letter, and
Szilard’s appeal, were lying, unread, on
the President’s desk on April 12, 1945,
when Roosevelt died.
With growing military pressure to
try out the new weapon, Truman set
up a committee of five politicians and
three scientists to decide the issue.
Four more atomic “experts” Oppen-
heimer, Fermi, Compton, and Law-
rence (inventor of the cyclotron)
were called in as an advisory panel.
These experts were not asked whether
the bomb should be used, but only
how. They were asked only technical
questions such as the estimated
number of people who would be
killed (they said 20,000). The com-
mittee finally, and secretly, recom-
mended that the bomb be used as
soon as possible, on a “dual” target
(i.e., not solely military), and with-
out warning.
When this news leaked out, many
scientists at Los Alamos, Oak Ridge,
and Chicago reacted violently. An
influential group, including Szilard,
warned the Government of the conse-
quences, including the inevitable atomic
arms race. They suggested instead a
demonstration on some barren island,
to be followed by an offer to renounce
such a weapon, on condition that ail
nations joined in the setting up of
efficient international control.
The Government referred this pro-
posal back to Oppenheimer, Fermi,
Lawrence, and Compton. This was,
perhaps, the last opportunity man had
to change the present course of his-
tory. Lawrence was against dropping
the bomb; Fermi was confused and
unhappy. Had Oppenheimer urged
them to support their colleagues, the
bomb might never have been used on
Hiroshima. (Whether, of course, the
Russians would have stopped work on
it they were then well advanced
will never be known.)
At 5.30 a.m. on August 16, 1945,
after a final massive effort to finish the
bomb before the war ended, Oppen-
heimer may have begun to change his
mind. In the darkness at Alamagordo
the tense and suddenly apprehensive
group, which included General Groves,
Oppenheimer, and Fermi, saw the
awesome fireball spring into existence.
The watchers were transfixed with
fright at the power of the holocaust
across the desert. Oppenheimer was
gripping a post in the blockhouse when
the overwhelming, sustained, doomsday
roar arrived, some thirty seconds after
the flash.
He recalled later that a passage from
the Hindu epic, the Bhagavad Gita,
flashed into his mind:
If the radiance of a thousand suns
were to burst into the sky,
that would be like the splendour
of the Mighty One.
But as the monstrous cloud grew
into the lightening sky, another line
from the poem came to him:
I am become Death, the shatterer of
worlds.
But by then it was too late. Julius
Robert Oppenheimer had his achieve-
ment. And the world had the bomb.


TASMANIA:
PROSPERITY WITHOUT PROFIT?
By MICHAEL BAUME
THE TASMANIAN DREAM was
built around the mystique of hydro-
electric power. This was to be the basis
on which Tasmania would boom. It
would attract more and more power-
using industries and then the employees
of these industries would create a big
enough market to encourage other
industries that did not depend on cheap
power also to set up in Tasmania. So
would come progress. The annual
migration to the mainland would
cease: Tasmania would drop its mendi-
cant title and second-class status.
It, just has not happened that way.
Not ‘ even the unexpected help from
the staggeringly big boom in metals
and mining has helped Tasmania to
get much closer to its target of
doubling the population from its
present 350,000 to a level where its
experts think it would be economically
self-perpetuating. The chances are that
it may never be reached, despite the
vigorous efforts of the Tasmanian
Government and despite the incon-
testable successes it has had in attract-
ing industry to Tasmania by coming
to “special deals.”
There is a real need for urgency
about this. To have any chance of
success, Tasmania must expand while
it still has the advantages of cheaper
power and the mining boom running
for it. In time it could lose both. Mines
eventually run out (and metal prices
can go down as well as up), and hydro-
electric power could eventually lose
its already diminishing price advan-
tage.
Tasmanians don’t like to admit that
they may face a problem with the price
of hydro-electric power. Yet cheap
atomic power will eventually come to
the mainland. And even now the cost
of producing Tasmania’s hydro-electric
power is rising while mainland thermal
station power costs continue to fall.
In any event, the new schemes that
have been added to the Tasmanian
hydro-electric system have been in-
creasingly expensive, not only because
of rising construction costs but also
because the most economic projects
were done first; those that have fol-
lowed have generally not had the same
returns. There will be a fortunate
reversal of this trend when the Gordon
River in the wet south-west is dammed
in the first stage of a scheme costing
half as much as the Snowy Mountains
development but planned to produce
the same amount of power. But, after
that, there are no more usable water
resources left on the island; any future
power developments will have no advan-
tages over those on the mainland.
Even if Tasmania could hold its
power advantage and if the mining
boom continued indefinitely, these two
would not be enough in themselves to
provide the economic boost that Tas-
mania needs. For, with very few excep-
tions, the industries that have been
attracted to Tasmania by cheap electric
power employ plenty of capital but few
people. Not even the mining boom is
creating very many jobs. Modern
methods mean that even major projects
like the iron ore mining and pelletis-
ing operation at Savage River and
Port Latta are not big employers. Like
most projects of this size, they take
more people to build than to run.
For Tasmanians themselves, the in-
dustrialisation boom has brought a sort
of profitless prosperity. Of course there
are some people in better jobs, and
employment opportunities have in-
creased a little, and there are some
good temporary positions going as con-
struction workers. But most Tasmanians
have been untouched by the spending
of millions of pounds on some of Aus-
tralia’s major projects.* The $4O mil-
lion to be spent on repairing the damage
done by February’s fires will probably
have a greater immediate impact on
the Tasmanian economy than many of
the recent big developments.
There are some industries based on
local resources which use a fair amount
of labor, like paper mills and food
processing (Tasmania is becoming the
frozen-pea isle rather than the apple
isle), but there are limits to this —-
and anyway these operations are also
very capital-intensive. There are others
that have taken advantage of the large
supply of female workers, which helps
explain why there is such a large
textile industry in Tasmania.
For companies that do not use huge
amounts of electricity 24 hours a day,
do not have to dig stuff out of the
ground, or do not depend on agricul-
tural products grown there, the Tas-
manian Government’s Directorate of
Industrial Development has to find
other reasons for them to move across
Bass Strait. There are few other seduc-
tion techniques available that cannot
be matched on the mainland.
The Tasmanians argue that the cost
of land at suitable sites near centres
of population is much cheaper than on
the mainland; that houses for employ-
ees are provided by the Government;
that long-term Government loans are
available to industry at lower than
normal interest rates (there is about
$3 million out on loan now); that the
labor force is steadier with less turn-
over than on the mainland and
European migrants like the milder
weather; that the cost of supplies is
not much greater than on the main-
land with the Bass Strait ferries.
But the new Bass Strait ferries that
the Tasmanians are so pleased about
and which have greatly increased the
opportunities for Tasmanian goods to
get to mainland markets, have also
made it more difficult for Tasmania
to get all the industries she wants. For
even if Tasmania’s population does
grow large enough to support its own
manufacturing base, the ferries have
removed much of the cost and time
burden that once isolated Tasmania,
and have therefore done away with
much of the incentive for companies
to set up in Tasmania.
Why should Tasmania try to be a
viable entity anyway? The new “sea-
road” of roll-on, roll-off ferries linking
Tasmania with Melbourne and Sydney
means that Tasmania has really become
simply a region that is fairly convenient
to the major cities, that is good at
producing some things, and that will
probably never be as good at producing
most of the other things that are made
in big industrialised centres like Syd-
ney or Newcastle or Melbourne. It is
the place that companies could go to
if they wanted to get the benefits of
decentralisation - and there are real
benefits. But it will probably never
really be a “centre” in itself.
* The new developments are impressive. The
iron ore project at the Savage River (which
later this year will begin production of pellets
at Port Latta from iron ore mined at the
Savage River and piped through a 55-mile
line I is costing $62 million; Comalco is spend-
ing $9 million to increase its aluminum
capacity to 71,500 tons a year land has pre-
pared an area for similar expansion in the
next few years); Australian Newsprint Mills
is spending $2B million to double its capacity;
Renison is nearing the end of a $9 million
tin development (with plans for another $l5
million on the way); Associated Fulp is build-
ing a $l2 million paper mill; Goliath Cement
is spending $414 million on new plant; Patons"
and Baldwins is proceeding with its ten-year,
$614 million expansion; Temco (a BHP sub-
sidiary; recently installed a $314 million
additional manganese smelter; The Aberfovle
group is developing the Mt. Cleveland tin
mine at a cost of $7 million, and Mt. Lyell is
to spend $l2 million on an underground mine
for its newly discovered deeper copper reserves.


OVERSEAS
President Johnson:
the hardest days of his life
By a special reporter
ON A QUIET Saturday afternoon
recently, a White House reporter
checked in at his post and literally
bumped into Lyndon Johnson, prowling
the corridors. “What’s up, Mr. Presi-
dent?” the startled reporter blurted.
“Not a damn thing is up,” the President
mumbled, “we’re damn low.”
Such off-guard candor is hardly news
in Washington, where a war-weary
President is obviously experiencing the
hardest days of his life. Yet it would
be inaccurate to suggest, as some are
inclined to do, that the chips from the
Great Society have been cashed in or
that the President, after losing a few
big bets, has sworn off the game. The
President is a much better politician
than he has demonstrated of late, and
there is no Republican opponent being
talked about who bears any resem-
blance to a future President.
The recent speculation that Johnson
might opt for retirement is fanciful,
and has no doubt been encouraged by
the President’s own tendency to indulge
in self-pity. In numerous private con-
versations, he has talked of late with
increasing bitterness about those whom
he has served faithfully and who, in
return, are now snapping at his heels
“with the rest of the wolf pack.” He
is particularly bitter about his grow-
ing unpopularity among Negroes, be-
lieving and rightly that no other
President has done more for civil rights
than he. This disappointment may ex-
plain the very brief references to civil
rights matters in his State of the Union
message.
But his greatest scorn is reserved for
the liberal ranks of the Democratic
Party, especially its Eastern contingent,
who have been in the front lines of
those hurling bricks at his Vietnam
policies and accusing him of deserting
most of his Great Society programs now
that they have become law. “I’ve given
them (liberals) all the programs they
have been wanting for more than 20
years, and all I get in return is sneers,”
he has complained. John F. Kennedy
always received the benefit of the
liberals’ doubts, but not Lyndon John-
son. So he believes.
Accordingly, the President’s current
state of mind is of more genuine con-
cern among his followers than the State
of the Union. For while it is tempting
to compare his popularity dip with
Harry Truman’s and recall how* the
peppery Missourian fought back to vic-
tory, the fact is that where Truman
was a fighter Johnson is a brooder. And
when on very rare occasions he does
attempt to fight back he invariably says
the wrong thing. It is clear that John-
son is not a public man, willing to air
the nation’s problems and take on all
comers before the camera’s eye. But
when the private, behind-the-scenes
“reasoning together” breaks down, what
is the remaining alternative?
This is what worries Administration
officials. That their leader is currently
embattled is not too worrisome; it is
in the nature of things for the Presi-
dent to catch hell every so often. What
is worrisome is that this President is
taking his licking poorly, retreating deep
into the recesses of the White House
where he is neither seen nor heard by
the people or by members of his Federal
family. The open secret is that Wash-
ington has been rather leaderless since
early last summer. “The only message
we get,” says one agency director, “is
to hold costs at all costs. Unless you’re
"...a very serious image problem”
involved in Vietnam these days, forget
it.”
The extent of the President’s sensi-
tivity can perhaps best be appreciated
when it is recognised that, aside from
Vietnam (admittedly a very big aside),
he actually has fared rather well with
his critics. Indeed, he has gone un-
scathed in a number of instances where
sound criticism was justified.
It is doubtful whether any President
in modern history has played his hands
closer to the vest than Lyndon John-
son. This penchant for secrecy is well
documented and has resulted in costly
and unbelievable blunders. Embarrassed
aides usually try to explain away in-
cidents resulting from premature dis-
closures of a Presidential action by
pointing out that Johnson was only
trying to maintain his options. In fact,
his bullying of the Press, and his obvi-
ous reluctance to impart information to
those directly affected by his decisions
until the last possible moment, may have
tended to cut severely into his choices.
In addition, petty and secretive be-
haviour has caused a very serious image
problem for President Johnson. Labels
are something a politician fears most.
An adjective prefixed to the proper
name see.ms to stick no matter how
the victim squirms. Witness Robert
Kennedy’s continuous bout with the
word “ruthless” or Hubert Humphrey’s
ordeal with “radical.” (In Humphrey’s
case the word has stuck so well that
House Minority Leader Gerald Ford
never loses an opportunity to refer to
“the Johnson-Humphrey Administra-
tion,” knowing that the Vice-Presi-
dent’s name is cause enough to raise
the hackles in certain quarters.) Presi-
dent Johnson is now stuck with a
formidable adjective which his .critics
have glued on to his illustrious forehead
—“Uncredible.”
Concern over the President’s sincerity,
honesty, and integrity has led, in turn,
to questions about his Administration’s
overall credibility an issue that could
be more damaging in the long run than
any other, including Vietnam. The so-
called “Credibility Gap” (which, by
the way, has become the Press’ code
name for the White House) is also a
tribute to Johnson’s temperamental ex-
tremes.
The President’s most persistent prob-
lem appears to be himself. He has
obviously taken to heart the old chest-
nut about snatching defeat from the
jaws of victory, because he has mastered
the art.
Although he has slowed domestic
spending to a snail’s pace, he is ready
to concede nothing and larded his State
of the Union speech with a list of pro-
posed legislation that was basically un-
important and certainly costless. (We
will help the American Indian; we must
do more for educational television,
etc.) And as he grumbles about his
critics and broods about his dilemmas
this long winter, one wonders whether
this truly gifted President realises how
often he is the one who is pushing his
Administration into nasty corners.
Meanwhile, there is talk that the
President will become very active next
spring and summer. His participation in
an April meeting of Latin American
heads of state, it is said, will be the
signal for a whirlwind of public appear-
ances across the country to try to bolster
his stock with the people. Of course,
the last time such a trip was considered,
the President denied that any visits
were contemplated.
Because he sees no immediate threat
to his re-election by the likes of Michi-
gan’s Governor George Romney, Cali-
fornia’s Governor Ronald Reagan, or
Illinois’ freshman Senator Charles
Percy, the President may continue to
go his own way in any way he so desires.
But unless he comes to grips with the
fact that his own personality stands in
the way of his genuine achievements,
he ,may be going his own way alone.

Tension on the other frontier
By APRIL HERSEY
IF JOHN CLARK, teacher of NIDA
pupils and director for the Old Tote,
had stayed in America for another
month he feels he may have decided
to “take a trip” on LSD. This doesn’t
mean that twelve months on a Hark-
ness Scholarship had brought him low,
but rather that LSD is a fact of life on
United States campuses.
At UCLA, where he spent most of
his time studying television in their
Theatre Arts Department, he was
gradually made aware of the envelop-
ing disenchantment of the young in-
tellectuals which has turned them
against the whole structure of The
Great Society.
“This is partly because of the war
in Vietnam, which touches them all
personally, but it seems to be an
underlying unhappiness, a sense of
terrifying insecurity,” he told me in a
pause between rehearsals for Pinter’s
“Homecoming,” his first play since he
returned to Australia. “Whatever the
reason for the unhappiness, LSD and
marihuana are used to allay it. There
is a general conditioning for LSD
going on all the time in the universities.
No one is pushed into it, but every-
one tries so hard and so openly to
explain the mysterious effect that most
people gradually succumb to the temp-
tation of trying it out. Personally, I was
afraid of what my imagination might
do to me but another month in the
climate of the psychedelic and I am
sure I would have been telling this
with complete understanding of the
phenomenon. Those who have tried
LSD are confident that if Johnson tried
it the war in Vietnam would be over
in a week.”
Despite the temptations to explore
his psyche Clark learnt a great deal
about television while he was away,
though more from the technical side
than the inspirational.
“American television goes on all day
and almost all night on nine channels,”
he said. “And it is commercialism run
riot. We .may complain about some of
the ‘American shows we see here, but
we are getting only the cream of their
productions. And the sheer weight of
commercials is hard to believe, many
of them designed to be remembered
by their very abrasiveness. There are
some educational television stations, pri-
vately supported, but they are very
poor and terribly dull.”
As this is a condemnation which
could also be levelled at most of Aus-
tralian television, John Clark has come
home with a theory that unless the
universities begin to take an interest
in television and film-making in Aus-
tralia we will never get anywhere.
“I’m convinced that sooner or later
the universities must do this if we
want to have better television and a
sensible film industry. The best place
to start is to set up schools and'treat
the, business as a profession. There are
at present no fulltime independent
training facilities for television in New
South Wales. Anyone who wants to
learn must first get a job where he
can learn, which means he tries out
his inexperience on the public. There
is a desperate need for some sort of
training.”
This sort of school could be added
to the departments at the University of
N.S.W., where there is already closed
television. In fact, an unofficial exer-
cise has already been tried. A student
production of “Reedy River” was
enhanced by a flashback film which
interrupted the stage and
John Clark
this was made in the studio at the Uni-
versity and put on 16mm. film.
A documentary film will also be
made this year and the subject matter
is at present being explored. They in-
tend to draw on the departments of
the University, as they have the unique
opportunity to exploit this area to the
full.
Clark was not particularly interested
in Broadway on his trip, though he
found that in cafe theatres off Broad-
way some “very exciting and unusual
stuff was being done.” He was much
more interested in the Guthrie Theatre
in Minneapolis, where he stayed for
some months “watching and learn-
ing.”
Part of the Harkness grant was the
use of a car and the chance of taking
his wife and three children with him
to America, so he took full advantage
of being able to look at the American
way of life. The Clarks spent July,
August, and September last year explor-
ing and camping. They drove from Los
Angeles to many parts of the country
and even into the Canadian Rockies, an
area Clark had wanted to see from
childhood.
A Tasmanian, educated at the Uni-
versity of Tasmania, and with an addit-
ional degree in drama from the Uni-
versity of Bristol in England, Clark
learnt much of his skill as a producer
at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School.
He has never wanted to act and is
very happy working with students,
whom he considers unbiased and with-
out the prejudices of many professional
actors.
He didn’t in fact take advantage of
the full twenty-one months of his
scholarship but returned to NIDA to
start the first term. His' general im-
pression of America was of brutality.
He felt an undercurrent of violence
which was not always racial, though it
certainly wasn’t personal. To the Ameri-
cans, Australia is being romanticised as
“the last frontier” now that California
is full, and apparently Clark was con-
sidered as a scout spying out some cul-
ture for a theatre which doesn’t yet
exist in their eyes.
On the plate
by JANE RANDOLPH
MAX HUTCHINSON, of Sydney’s
Gallery A, who pioneered the produc-
tion of lithographs in Melbourne, is in
the process of transferring his plant to
Sydney, leaving only the means of
proofing behind him for the southern
artists.
The reason for the move appears to
be that Sydney has more willing and
adventurous printers interested in try-
ing the work. “It needs someone who is
both an artist and a printer,” Hutchin-
son said. “Because it isn’t just another
job it’s a tremendous happening each
time and the atmosphere in the place
is quite electric waiting for the first
proof.”
.The graphic artist works directly on


to the plate, supervises each print, signs
those he approves and destroys the
others. After the limited edition (no
more than 75) is completed, he super-
vises the destruction of the plate.
“These graphics are quite distinct
from reproduction prints,” Max Hutch-
inson said. “There really is no original,
since each one differs slightly. The
snobbish feeling that prints are second-
rate art doesn’t apply in this field and
in fact internationally people are buy-
ing up graphics both as collections and
as investments.”
The beauty of the lithograph is that
the art lover with limited means can
own a Drysdale for $5O which would
cost him $2OOO on canvas. Nor is the
$5O a static situation. According to
Hutchinson supply and demand will
affect the sale of prints just as it affects
every other type of art. Though he will
release the initial edition at a pre-
determined figure, say $5O each, one of
them coming round for the second time
will be treated on its merits as a work
of art.
Hutchinson’s equipment has already
led many major Australian painters into
the field of graphic art through the
offices of the National Gallery Society
of Australia, who commissioned artists
and purchased the editions they pro-
duced for members. The artists included
Drysdale (six editions), Leonard
French, Albert Tucker, John Olsen,
Donald Friend, Roger Kent, Colin
Lanceley, Charles Reddington, and Fred
Williams.
Though Fred Williams had had some
experience in the medium, most artists
were grateful for the advice of Janet
Dawson, who had gained her knowledge
overseas and willingly gave her time.
They all worked in Hutchinson’s Gal-
lery in Melbourne, poring over the zinc
plates and often becoming deeply fascin-
ated by the techniques involved. Very
little of their work has reached the
general public.
The new Sydney scheme will pro-
duce graphics for the people who can
afford to gamble $5O. “It is a tremen-
dous way to start collecting,” Hutchin-
son said. “Or even to get a good under-
standing of modern Australian art.
Young people are so much more aware
of what is good today, and the only
thing that stops these hungry gallery
prowlers is money. The graphics will
fall into very appreciative hands, and
the artists are confident that they will
reach a new public with their work.”
The artists themselves will get about
the same amount for an edition as they
would for one of their paintings. First
to try the art for the artisans approach
in Sydney will be John Olsen, Janet
Dawson, Charles Reddington, and Colin
Lanceley.
To keep the whole thing highly
ethical and to promote the idea of
prints a Print Council is in the pro-
cess of birth. Members will include the
Crosley and South Yarra Galleries, also
gearing up, and, of course, Gallery A.

Yo-yo
by DAVID HAYNES
Alphaville. Director, Jean-Luc Godard.
CERTAINLY, THE MOST over-
praised surfie of the New Wave has
been Jean-Luc Godard. And now there’s
“Alphaville,” Godard’s essay into
science-fiction, allegedly “the first and
most terrifying entry of pop-art into
the cinema” and the “most important
film since ‘Citizen Kane’.” My reaction
to his pop-art wasn’t terror but excruiat-
ing boredom.
Shot in the hotel lobbies of contem-
porary Paris, it depicts a dehumanised
tomorrow run by ruthless computer
logic, where words 'like “tenderness”
have disappeared from the vocabulary.
Lemmy Caution, a character based on
Dick Tracy and played by Eddie Con-
stantine (a Parisian Ronald Reagan),
arrives in Alphaville on a secret miss-
ion, meets Mrs. Luc Godard, and while
the immortal* Raoul Coutard scuttles
ahead with his Arriflex they wander
up and down endless corridors together.
Godard is praised for his philosophy,
but the ideas in “Alphaville” have been
cliche since Huxley wrote “Brave New
World.” His long, hand-held takes pro-
voke lyrical articles, but Murnau’s
camera followed action far more
sinuously in “The Last Laugh” of 1924.
But even as I snipe I recognise that
Godard is above and beyond criticism.
Like the hula-hoop he is a craze. And
like the yo-yo he will drop from sight.

Tiny Alice
By ELWYN LYNN
Charles Blackman. South Yarra Gal-
leries, Melbourne.
THE EXPEDITION of Charles Black-
man’s Alice Paintings, done in 1956-57
and preceded by large studies on paper
in 1955, is more than a goodwill
gesture. The works, most of which are
owned by Mrs. Blackman and which are
not for sale, attest to the gallery’s faith
in the artist (and his consistent ability
to conjure up memorable images), for
an artist of Blackman’s generation runs
a risk in showing earlier, successful
work. There is a tendency to praise the
later, and, for example, Nolan has
recently had his late Kellys treated with
disdain in Melbourne.
It’s fortunate that such a splendid
series, that has its parallel only in the
1946-47 Kellys, should have been pre-
served when shown at Melbourne’s
Museum of Modern Art in 1957 there
were only a few perceptive buyers like
John Reed, who owns Alice’s great,
picture-filling shoe and the golden Alice
herself. They were not shown again
until 1966 in Brisbane, when Judith
Wright wrote of Alice in the introduc-
tory note: “She is lucky to be known
so well by a great painter, but he is
lucky, too, to have found her waiting
for him at the important crossroads in
his own world and to have recognised
her for the touchstone that she is.”
Actually Blackman didn’t read
“Alice,” but heard Robin Holmes read-
ing it on one of the talking books
for the blind listened to by his wife.
(They were later to find Holmes most
unconvincing when reading the BBC
news!) Blackman had no stimulus from
illustrated editions, and his paintings
have none of Tenniel’s interest in
quaint persons and anecdotal por-
trayals, but deal with situations like
those at the Mad Hatter’s Party (which
were not unlike his own experiences in
the restaurant where he was working
while he painted the series). It was like
being in a Kitchen Sink ballet, and
many of the paintings have a zany,
balletic levitation.
To children and waiters, kitchen
utensils are wilful creatures; teapots and
bottles pour themselves, cups float and
tables grow. It’s not like the occasional
upside down bird or policeman in
Nolan, or the uncanny, floating rock in
a Magritte; the whole Wonderland is
so in orbit that the treatment pounds
at the doors of expressionism. The paint
is wilder, the transitions more abrupt,
and the verve more immediate than in
his recent work, for he has distilled a
calmer joy from this earlier, robust
poetry, but his incandescent bouquets
of today once bloomed in Alice’s garden
and her uncommitted innocence, com-
pounded of wonder and commonsense,
is still fresh in his portraits of children.
Those who think he grows too elegant
should recall Cezanne’s journey from
rough impasto to delicate staining, and
Matisse’s from ecstatic Fauvism to
serene, still paint.
In “Upside Down Alice” everything
except the table and a teetering vase
float wrong side up in an imaginative
suspension of normality. “Goodbye
Feet” verges on the grotesque as the
hare’s ears and the legs of both Alice
and the table stretch absurdly in a room
that’s so askew with distorted perspec-
tive that there’s a hint of Chirico’s
pittura “Metafisica.” Doors open to
nowhere in “Drink Me”; tiny windows
in a dark grey painting reveal sparkling
landscapes, and “Shrinking Alice” seems
destined for a small menacing door. In
this painting the tabletop has gone, and
objects suspended above it seem wafted
up from nowhere, as is Alice in Reed’s
“Alice” and, indeed, as are the animals
in Nolan’s African paintings of 1963.
In others all is childlike ingenuous-
ness: “Alice in the Boat,” with hare
and teapot, floats in limpid water
under a pure and innocent sky, and
in one of the most effective works
here, “The White Tablecloth,” tea-
pots that pour themselves, bottles that
spout, and gentle heads that hide are
wafted into existence from the virginal

Top bananas
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Erik Awards. Russell St. Theatre, Mel-
bourne.
Where’s Daddy? William Inge. St.
Martin’s Theatre, Melbourne.
IN MEMORY OF THE late Erik
Kuttner, a German producer who
worked in Melbourne in the ’sos, annual
Erik awards are made to the best actor,
actress, producer, and set designer on
the basis of a single performance or
production. Its judges are the first
and second string critics for Melbourne’s
dailies and the “Listener In,” and the
’66 awards recently presented were as
follows:
Best actor: Paul Karo for his role in
“Lily in Little India.” Best actress:
Jill Perryman for “Funny Girl.”
Best producer: George Oglivie for
“The Knack.” Best set designer:
Kristian Fredrikson for “War and
Peace.”
As awards thrive on a little con-
troversy, let’s pick at the critics’ bunch
of top bananas. Karo’s performance as
the yearning Alvin Hanker not only
transcended an otherwise common-or-
garden play but was splendid in absolute
terms. But the smiling ironies of Robin
Ramsay’s Tom in “The Knack” seemed
to me to score in a photo finish.
Perryman? Hmmm. What about Jac-
queline Kott’s equally arduous and
far more subtle performance in “Moon
for the Misbegotten”? Or even Bunney
Brooke’s knock-about lesbian in “Sister
George”?
Fredrikson’s set for “War and
Peace” was an ingenious and evocative
piece of conjuring, but it looked posi-
tively turgid beside Richard Prin’s bare
necessities for “The Knack.”
In William Inge’s “Where’s Daddy?”
Helmut Bakaitis played with style

BOOKS
The Struggle of James Joyce
By S. L. GOLDBERG
Letters of James Joyce. Vols. II and
111. Faber. $39.20.
COMPARED WITH the letters of
James or Lawrence or Pound, Joyce’s
are sadly disappointing: few general
ideas (and those not particularly good
ones), not much observation, very little
about his world or his central con-
cerns as a writer, not even any literary
gossip. It’s hard to imagine anyone be-
ing led by reading through them to
want to ■ read his books, as one can
with James or Lawrence. On the con-
trary, it’s hard to imagine anyone
reading through them at all unless he
was led to it by his interest in the
books. For the letters were clearly not
written by Joyce the artist, but rather
Joyce the “jealous, lonely, dissatisfied,
proud man,” as he once described
himself, a man demanding, suspicious,
clever, arrogant, often witty, always
determined, narrow but intense in his
affections.
They are from Joyce the son and
brother, husband and father, lavishing
both demands and love on his family;
Joyce the victim of poverty and ill-
ness; Joyce the busy promoter of his
books; Joyce the gradually successful
but always enigmatic literary figure;
even, at times, Joyce the immensely
ambitious craftsman. But the great
imaginative writer, patiently express-
ing his mature understanding of the
world and of himself and of how they
relate to each other of this Joyce
there is virtually nothing. Which is,
as one ponders it, perhaps the most' in-
teresting thing about them.
Most of the obviously interesting
ones, especially those where he dis-
cusses his work in any detail, were in-
cluded in Stuart Gilbert’s selection in
1957. Professor Ellmann has now com-
pleted the collection in these two
splendidly edited volumes, and they
form a fitting complement to his monu-
mental biography of Joyce.
Yet, if we look in these volumes for
such light as they do throw on Joyce’s
work rather than for the facts of his ex-
istence, we find it shines only obliquely.
It is raw material we discover, more
than light; and it is the raw material,
less of the content of the books, as we
might have hoped, than the raw
material of the artist who wrote them.
Here is the stuff out of which came the
mature, ironic, comic artist, the figure
whose vision creates and orders each
of his major works. The everyday man
who emerges from the letters—“human,
erring, and condonable” (or at least
usually condonable) - is clearly the
substance out of which Stephen Dedalus
and Bloom and H.C.E. are made. The
artist who could make them, who could
understand and create them so objec-
tively, is a personality that includes
theirs of course, but transcends them;
but he never appears in the letters. And
as we search in vain for him, wondering
if he was too shy (or too arrogant) to
appear, we begin to realise that he never
appears simply because he was never
born into the ordinary world of money-
orders, patched trousers, unsatisfactory
flats, and eye operations. He lives only
as the pervasive imagination of the
books.
The artist-self is a person Joyce had,
it seems, constantly to discover in him-
self, by ruthless self-exploration and self-
understanding. He never wasted that self
outside the books; the artist’s only
actions are those of imaginative creation.
The writer of the letters is a man with
the failings and blindness of other men.
Significantly enough, the most re-
vealing letters are those to members
of his family: to his mother, Nora, his
wife, Stanislaus, his brother, and later
to his son and daughter. Only within
that group was he prepared, or per-
haps able, to expose himself; as the
family in all its relationships is the
centre of his books, so it was of his life.
Only the first, abandoned version
of the “Portrait, Stephen Hero,” re-
flects the actual relationship between
the youthful Joyce and his mother.
From the “Portrait” onwards, and the
birth of his own son, the stress shifted
to the father. That, for the mature
creator, inevitably became a more im-
portant relationship than it had been
for the clever, ambitious young student.
In Nora Barnacle, the uneducated
servant-girl he fell in love with, he at
first found something of the same
quality as in his mother: a beauty and
simplicity of nature in which he could
find an escape, as he confessed, from
his own youthful “contemptuous, sus-
picious nature.” What he eventually
found was more complex and less
“romantic”: a woman capable of rous-
ing his sensuality, perversity, intense
possessive jealousy, irritation, and sheer
bafflement. She clearly led him to
discover much of Bloom in himself and
also something of Gabriel Conroy in
“The Dead” and Richard Rowan, the
hero of “Exiles.” But equally clearly
she could not help the artist to under-
stand, judge, and express these elements
of life with the balanced sanity he
achieved in his work. His extraordinary
letters to her are one of the most fascin-
ating groups in Professor Ellman’s
collection, but his finest tribute to her
is the last chapter of “Ulysses,” where
he created Molly Bloom out of his
understanding and love of her.
However, we may wonder if he ever
managed to see quite objectively one
aspect of his feelings about her, so
that it slipped past his critical eye
directly into his work: the sense of
self-abandonment she could give him.
It is obviously connected with his
masochistic fantasies, which he did
understand; but was it also the origin
of his impulse finally to surrender his
mind, his judgments, all complexities,
all distinctions in the obliterating em-
brace of Molly Bloom and Anna Livia
Plurabelle?
The family, for Joyce, was an insti-
tution founded on mutual love, tem-
pered by mutual incomprehension. The
chief exception in his own case at
least for a time was his relationship
with Stanislaus. To his common-
sensible, intelligent, free-thinking, and
admiring young brother he could open
his mind freely about art, Dublin,
people, books, his own plans, politics,
morals - and his perennial shortage of
cash.
The letters between the two brothers
from 1904 to 1912 are the fullest and
most pleasant in the whole collection—
sharp, funny, blunt, self-mocking, and
honest. It is clear that if Joyce got
money incessantly from Stanislaus, he
also got books, ideas, criticism, and
encouragement.
And yet the tie didn’t last. One of
the saddest things about these letters is
to watch it fraying, especially after
Joyce moved from Italy to Zurich:
Joyce, increasingly successful (though
his total royalties on “Dubliners” for
the first three years amounted to 2/6),


Stanislaus left in Trieste, a little envious,
and increasingly resentful that he had
given himself so generously and got so
little in return. Joyce seems never to
have opened his mind so intimately to
anyone again; and as we read through
the business letters, the affectionate
worrying over his children, the details
of daily life and almost daily troubles,
we may well conclude that the loss was
not all Stanislaus’. The artist who wrote
“Finnegans Wake” is quite invisible, in
real touch with no one else, almost (it
seems) protecting himself behind the
life of the man.
Smith's Splendors
By EDGAR HOLT
Remember Smith’s Weekly? George
Blaikie. Rigby Limited. $4.25.
ONLY A MAN like George Blaikie,
who was part of it, could write this kind
of book about “Smith’s Weekly.” Fie
is in the tradition which insists that all
who worked for the paper shared a
unique experience, a sentimental ad-
venture in journalism,' heady, gay, and
slightly mad. Newspapermen will get
drunk over this book; old readers of
“Smith’s” will find it evocative; people
who never read “Smith’s” will wonder
what it is all about.
It would have been out of character
to put down a solemn and sober assess-
ment of “Smith’s” as part of Australian
social history from 1919 to 1950. George
Blaikie has re-created the living quality
of the paper through the people who
made, wrote, and illustrated it.
Like everybody who worked on the
staff, he looks back through rose tints.
His parade of brilliant writers and
artists burns always with a hard, gem-
like flame. In truth, there was some
rare talent in the weird mob that took
part in the weekly miracle of produc-
tion.
The creative imagination, flair, and
showmanship of Claude McKay, the
financial backing of Joynton Smith, and
the managerial skill of Robert Clyde
Packer translated an idea into a weekly
newspaper which made a noisy and
provocative impact on a country still
pretty conventional, respectable, and
middle-class. “Smith’s” took to itself
certain characteristics which it saw as
national cheeky individualism, lusty
prejudice, a distaste for authority, a
passion for social justice, and a convic-
tion that this is a man’s world. The
paper held up a mirror to Australians
in city and country who recognised
themselves in the style of the written
word and in the line of the black-and-
* Edgar Holt was the last
editor of “Smith’s Weekly.”
white drawings, which more than any-
thing else gave “Smith’s” an inter-
national reputation in the years of Cec
Hartt, Stan Cross, Joe Jonsson, George
Finey, and the rest of the talented
group.
Some very able writers worked for
“Smith’s” between 1919 and 1950. Even
after the paper’s golden age had gone
Lennie Lower was making laughter in
his gentle way; but the written con-
tent was dominated, in the long periods
of his command, by the strong person-
ality and sharp pen of the founding
Editor-in-Chief, Claude McKay. This
is not to say that individualism in the
writing staff was discouraged. Claude
McKay had little time for conformists.
But the black-and-white artists, with
their friendly contempt for scribblers,
had more licence to be efficiently crazy.
Old readers today who talk nostalgic-
ally remember the artwork more
vividly than the crusades, the passion-
ate battles for the underdog, the de-
bunking of the pompous, the lost causes,
and the libel actions.
“Smith’s” went after news as well
as fun. Setting out to involve itself with
its readers, it made their causes its own
causes. The emphasis was on “social
justice.” Claude McKay cared little
about murder as news because, he
argued, few people expect to be mur-
dered. What they knew about was
being pushed around. The device of
involving the paper with the readers
and the readers with the paper was used
to encourage contributions. Over the
years tens of thousands of readers sent
in small items which were printed,
signed, and paid for. Some of these
contributors felt as intimately associated
with “Smith’s” as the staff itself.
Looking “Smith’s Weekly”
emerges as a period piece. It was
attuned to a kind of Australianism
which may now be gone. It had some
affinity, in its style, with the virile,
witty periodical journalism of London
in the ’nineties. The men who drew
and wrote for the paper were of their
period. Most of them would resist
today’s disciplines and restraints.
Producing “Smith’s” was, of course,
a job, and in the first decade was a
very well-paid job; but the team also
looked on it as a game, a pleasant
form of insanity repeated week after
week in a setting of noise, argument,
laughter, and recrimination, with a pub
close by.
Laughter was always near the sur-
face. In the early days the leader was
headed “Why I Publish Smith’s
Weekly,” and was signed by Sir Joynton
Smith. One day a friend pulled him
up in the street and asked: “Why are
you publishing ‘Smith’s’ this week?”
“I don’t know,” said Joynton. “I haven’t
read it yet.”
Like all newspapers, “Smith’s” went
through good and bad periods. But
it made fortunes for a few and pro-
vided a lot of fun for many. In the
end, it did not languish and die. It
was killed. Perhaps this was the right
exit for a journal that never knew a
dull moment.
Writing on
the wall
By GEOFFREY LEHMANN
Graffiti. Richard Freeman. Hutchinson.
$6.15.
THE ABOMINABLE snowman’s foot-
prints painted on a post-box, pug-
nacious and meaningless messages
chalked in it seems places no human
hand could reach, mammoth disem-
bodied genitalia gesturing and romping
in wild dances of their own on the
walls of public lavatories, childish faces
chalked in subways and disintegrating
with damp and grime are all the pro-
duct of that mysterious trade union
of graffitists, who remain resolutely
underground, refuse affiliation with any
other union, and remain irresistibly
anonymous despite the boldness with
which they advertise their names.
To be a true graffitist you must be
able to make yourself invisible. This is
why you never see a graffitist fleeing
from the job. Secondly you must have
either internal radar or extra-sensory
perception which allows you to know
that someone is coming. Very few
graffiti are incomplete. The expert
graffitist always knows exactly how
much time he has for the job, and
never allows himself to be caught in
the middle of it. Thirdly a graffitist
must be able to hover without the
assistance of cumbersome machinery
which would bring attention. By use of
an ingenious anti-gravity formula graf-
fitists are able to execute those artistic
sleight-of-hands you sometimes see
decorating inaccessible places such as
the roofs of subways, radio masts, and
eagles’ nests.
But these are mere mechanical
matters. It is quite useless if you have
all these acquirements and lack that
flair, that oomph, which characterises
the master graffitist, whether he is
depicting a baby’s bottom or quoting a
proverb in classical Greek.
Another characteristic of the master
graffitist is that he infiltrates. He gets
other people to do his graffiti unwit-
tingly.
A fine example of this was a sign
up at Kings Cross a few years ago,
which was placed on top of a building,
occupied several hundred square feet,
had blinking lights, and was the largest
and brightest graffito in the Southern
Hemisphere. It has been since put out
of action, but there is now a sign
functioning down in Bayswater Road
which is even more effective because
it is not so obvious.
Perhaps Sydney’s master graffitist is
a kook who paints blank rock faces
along railway lines with huge messages
daubed in whitewash. One of the best
samples of his I remember was situated
between Wollstonecraft and North Syd-

I remember rightly, “NO MORE

SAGES WITH ME. RATSACK FOR

King of the Graffitists must have been
either a medical student or practising
medico, because many of his graffiti
contained obscure medical references.
He was a master of the non sequitur,
the pungent phrase, the meaningless
profundity.
For sheer consistency, splendor of
concept, and design, this Michelangelo
of graffitists dwarfs any of the graf-
fitists whom Richard Freeman has been
able to dredge up in this collection of
graffiti and remarks and poems about
this subject. Freeman has wisely limited
his locale to London and places with
which he is familiar, so that each
graffito is a genuine, hand-picked little
master-product of the folk-mind. In
an age when transistors have robbed
people of the desire to sing their own
songs, reproductions have made them
ashamed of their own paintings, and
a mass of newsprint has swamped their
instinct to write ballads, folk-culture
has been driven underground into the
subways and toilets to blossom as graf-
fiti.
This desire for the authentic
expresses itself in pop-art, and graffito-
mania is a direct extension of pop-art.
It is rather sad. The last preserve of
John Bull was his lavatory. There he
could happily draw and write to his
heart’s content without the learned
doubt or genteel sneer. A great mush-
room culture flourished underground,
but now the critic has arrived with his
literary scalpel and the expert with his
magnifying glass. The results in this
book are quite enjoyable, although
hardly worth the expensive format
when a couple of pennies in a slot will
do the job just as well.
Some of the specimens are rather
fine. I CAN’T BREATHE written in
large desperate letters in a claustro-
phobic alley behind the Coliseum is
very good. O’KEEFE OF THE
ANTIPODES SEES ALL or YOU’RE
NEVER ALONE WITH SCHIZO-
PHRENIA or I AM BAD were all
graffiti which amused me. So, too, did
the omnipresent Kilroy:
Wipe that smile
From off your face
Kilroy built
The bloody place.
These samples of graffiti are inter-
spersed with little essays by the author
and occasional archaeological snippets.
It is interesting to know that the
Pompeians were much saner and
healthier in their graffiti than we are.
There are also a few feeble poems
about graffiti from some of the young
English literary set. Perhaps the graffito
is the subject par excellence for many
of them.
John Bull daubing away in his toilet
will outlive them all. There is a lot of
wisdom to be digested from writing on
a wall, as Belshazzar discovered to his
cost.
Reason and impulse
By J. M. COUPER
The Truthtellers. Laurence Lerner.
Chatto & Windus. $5.80.
LAURENCE LERNER makes the aim
of his book clear in a Euclidean way in
the opening sentence of Part Two. It
is required to prove that “what Jane
Austen most admired was the ability
to resist impulse; what Lawrence most
admired was surrender to it. George
Eliot was a Romantic: she did not be-
lieve there was a clear opposition be-
tween impulse and reason.” These
three authors are the truthtellers.
The QED is squarely and helpfully
given in the last sentence of the book:
“Jane Austen is a pre-Romantic; George
Eliot is a positive Romantic; Lawrence
is a Romantic subversive.” George
Eliot is with Wordsworth, Lawrence
with Baudelaire and Nietzsche.
The thesis holds the book together
while it explores what the three
novelists do and what they stand for.
It is for the quality of its criticism
that one would wish to read it or not.
The quality is high, the book valuable.
It is one of Jane Austen’s limited
perfections that she makes it very hard
for her critics. In setting out to praise
or blame her, they almost invariably
make nothing plainer than their own
inadequacy. Lerner is excellent on
“Sense and Sensibility,” where the pas-
sionate Marianne can do with the
of a more passionate sponsor, but is
he right in extending that help to
Lydia Bennet? He thinks that the
reader, seeing her devotion to Wickham,
is inclined to come out on Lydia’s side.
I should have thought her continued
improvidence and thoughtlessness call
the devotion in question, reduce it to
infatuation.
Of “Women in Love” Lerner says:
“Lawrence is constantly drawn into
losing distance from his characters,”
and he gives a reason connected with
the technique of that particular novel.
But this is something that is threatened
on every living page of Lawrence, and
it is part of the man. Lawrence’s ability
to show how love is a yielding, a merg-
ing, even in the face of circumstance
and below reason, is at the centre of his
force and integrity and a sound and
bold step in faithfulness. As Lerner
shrewdly says: “Here is an author who
writes better, not worse, for incompletely
detaching himself from an autobio-
graphical situation.”
Similarly, as they say in geometry,
for George Eliot. Only it is not similar
at all. One triumphant remark must
serve to show her masterly understand-
ing of human impulse and reason: “We
prepare ourselves for sudden deeds by
the reiterated choice of good or evil
which gradually determines character.”
It is for perception like this that Ler-
ner calls her the greatest of English
novelists.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Don’t restrain the pace of recovery
THERE ARE MURMURS from Canberra about balance-of-
payments problems once again, and murmurs like that usually
foreshadow action to restrain the economy. Of course the
situation has to be watched. Quite predictably the inflow
of capital has sharply declined in recent months, and imports
have shown a slight tendency to rise. These factors, plus the
cessation for the time being of Government borrowing
overseas, have produced quite a fall-off in our reserves of
foreign exchange.
But this is no cause for great alarm. Exports are doing
wonderfully, and promise to grow strongly through the
rest of this year and next. A quite fantastic wheat harvest
is just being brought in. Late last year we rather put
ourselves out on a limb saying that it could reach 420 m.
bushels, when the official Government estimate was 370 m.
Now the dfficial estimate is 448 m. bushels. Even more land
is being ripped up for wheat this year; though it may be
too much to hope for as good a season again, it is quite
possible that the larger acreage will enable the 1967
bumper crop to be reaped again. The coming financial
year will also see the first substantial recovery from drought
levels of production in the pastoral section of the economy.
Meat and wool production should rise strongly.
Outside the rural sector the expansion of mineral exports
year by year gives us considerably more leeway, though
manufacturing exports continue to rise by disappointingly
small amounts. But they are disappointingly small any-
way, so that is not of much overall importance. So the
picture for earnings looks bright.
On the debit side, imports must be expected to grow
again as industrial production recovers, but they are only
likely to rise sharply when fixed investment is re-established
at the levels of 1965. That will, even on the most optimistic
assumptions, be some time yet. Another consideration is
that imports of capital equipment tend to lag a good
distance behind the building side, since factory buildings
are generally put up before the imported equipment comes
in. By the end of this year the airlines will have virtually
completed their re-equipment with jets, so there at least
will be some relief for our balance of payments.
It is also possible to hope, though not too firmly, that
by 1968 British and American restrictions on capital out-
flow may be somewhat modified. There is also no reason
why we should not be able in the meantime to encourage
investors in Japan, Germany, and other Continental coun-
tries to step up their investments here.
All this adds up to a case which says that there is no
justification whatsoever for restraining the pace of recovery
of the domestic economy for fear of balance-of-payments
consequences. The balance of payments needs to be
MEN AND MATTERS
IT REALLY IS the end of an era; the
Orb of office at John Lysaght (Aust.)
Ltd. is being handed on. This week,
after a reign of 27 years, Mr. R. G. C.
Parry Okeden, the 66-year-old chair-
man, steps down in favor of Mr. E. B.
Gosse, the 51-year-old former joint
managing director.
Mr. Parry Okeden, Old Etonian and
the “very prototype of the senior busi-
ness executive in a technical age” (in
the words of University of Sydney’s
Professor S. H. Roberts, bestowing an
honorary doctorate of science in 1957),
will remain deputy chairman of John
Lysaght. He will still be fully
occupied with other business interests,
being on the board of ACI, Australian
Gas Light Co., and EMI, and with
government advisory work.
Mr. Parry Okeden has been in steel
ever since he left Eton. His first job
was at the Newport mill of John
Lysaght and Son (long before it had
anything to do with GKN) and it was
from there that he came to the Aus-
tralian company in 1923, going to the
Newcastle works. Six years later he
became a director and after another
eleven the chairman.
His departure brings several changes
at the top in Lysaghts. Mr. J. T. Gould,
director of finance and former com-
pany secretary, retires from the board
after 18 years’ service. Mr. H. J. Pearce,
also an ex-company secretary, director
of administration,
and latterly joint
managing direc-
tor, becomes sole
managing direc-
tor.
The new chair-
man is one of the
new breed of
highly qualified,
well - educated
local men who
are becoming in-
creasingly import-
ant in overseas-
owned businesses here. An Adelaide
man who earned his engineering degree
at Cambridge, Mr. Gosse started as a
cadet in BHP before joining Lysaghts
(with BHP’s permission) to become
galvanising superintendent at Newcastle
while still in his 20s. His steady trail
up the Lysaght structure resulted in his
appointment two years ago as joint
managing director with Harry Pearce
when Mr. Parry Okeden relinquished
his dual role of chairman and manag-
ing director.
Mr. Pearce (like Mr. Gosse and the
administration and finance manager,
Mr. D. R. Rickard) is 51, and also
started off in the Newcastle works.
IN THE DAYS when he was chairman
and managing director of Pye of Cam-
bridge, Mr. C. O. Stanley was a
E. B. Gosse
C. O. Stanley

frequent visitor to Australia, where his
listed subsidiary here, Pye Industries
Ltd., is a $l4 million operation. But
after his “retirement” from Pye almost
a year ago at the age of 66 (he is still
“honorary president”) his reasons for
coming here appeared to have gone.
But no. Last week he ended a stay here
of several weeks “on holiday” if
such a man ever takes a holiday.
While Mr. Stanley was in Australia,
the chairman’s seat at Pye that he had
filled for 42 years was filled by Mr.
Peter Thorneycroft, the former Con-
servative President of the Board of
Trade, following the controversial take-
over of Pye by Philips. It is ironic that
shortly after C. O. Stanley bought out
Mr. W. G. Pye’s electrical company in
1924 he tried unsuccessfully to sell it to
Philips for £25,000; it eventually cost
them £3O million.


continuously strengthened by rapid energetic exploitation
of export opportunities, by judicious import replacement,
and discriminating encouragement of foreign investment.
The domestic economy, though recovering better than we
expected before Christmas, is still nowhere near the optimum
level of operation. Unemployment is still too high, there
is still too much plant capacity unused, and factory expan-
sion the source of future growth —is stunted. Last
year’s recession, even though a mini-recession only, was a
waste of our resources. It should not be allowed to drag
on because of overly fearful attitudes to the future.
How to make decisions
PARTICIPATION IS the main technique in management
training in the United States. This was demonstrated very
clearly at a Caltex management seminar held in Canberra
last week. Even the journalists invited along to give the
affair some publicity were got to participate. Caltex hired
two Harvard Business School professors to conduct the course
for twenty-five of its top executives in the Asian and African
region.
One of the Harvard professors, Hugo Uyterhoeven,
explained that the seminar was designed to simulate many of
the conditions under which decisions had to be made by
harassed, tired men. For six and a half days the 25 men
were worked minimum twelve-hour days, going through
one case study after another, being called upon to con-
tinually apply their critical faculties to the problem, and
subject themselves to the criticism of their fellows.
The project, incidentally, throws interesting light on
the attitudes of the Harvard Business School. It greatly
encourages its staff to take on assignments like this, giving
them a three-month break between June and September each
year from teaching, and allowing one day each week for
outside work. This, explained Uyterhoeven, allowed them
to establish intimate contacts with the business community,
getting to know about real management in great detail.
“It stifles any tendencies to ivory-towerism, and refreshes
our teaching methods,” he said.
Talking about policy
DOES this complaint stand up? The Australian Indus-
tries Development Association’s latest report claims that
the views of industry on policy issues affecting it don’t
get a good enough airing in the Press and other publicising
media. A first thought is that perhaps not enough ferreting
among industrial leaders is done by reporters. Maybe that
is true. But AIDA is not pointing the bone directly at
any deficiencies in that respect. It contends that most of
the Press publicity given to industry’s problems derives from
statements by academics and others without direct practical
experience in industry. “No matter how eminent these
people may be, they cannot speak from hard practical
knowledge of industry itself,” AIDA asserts. So it exhorts
its member companies to speak louder and more often in
their annual company reports on what it calls “live issues,”
such as defence, tariffs, government orders, taxation, export
policies, migration, overseas investment, and so on.
AIDA may not think so, but the opinions of “academics
and others,” as it lumps them, are often very much to the
point, especially those of economists, whom we should hear
from more. They shouldn’t be neglected simply because
they sometimes smack too much of theorising of the reflec-
tive armchair variety. On the other side, the so-called
practical men are sometimes caught going into print rather
too close to their work benches and hoard rooms, not to say
their own vested interests. Because of this opinions on
national policy issues often have to be heavily discounted.
Apart from that, surely it is preferable for companies to
leave the expression of their thoughts on national policy
matters out of their annual reports, which are better con-
fined to a company’s own affairs. If they are worth a
hearing they are best spoken by company chairmen at
the annual meeting or by representatives of trade organisa-
tions, such as AIDA itself. This is the standard, and far
from neglected, practice.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy : The Federal Government is
on the verge of propounding concrete schemes to finance
domestic development which also allow completely local
ownership. One would organise the trading banks, with
Reserve standby, to create a s2som. revolving fund.
Another has hopes of attracting “specialised overseas
groups” to put up money for specific projects and still
permit retention of Australian ownership.
Covering the quarter ended February, the latest pro-
duction statistics reflect a better rural sector in such
items as utilities and panel vans and small internal com-
bustion engines; consumer durables look drab, heavy
industrial output marches well ahead ... A private
survey suggests “a moderate upturn” in factory activity.
February’s building approvals point to stimulating
levels in private residences.
For the markets S Pre-Easter dealings on Aus-
tralian share markets yielded a minute overall index rise,
the first for several weeks. The operative word is still
uncertain.
A better mood in London, with the pound firmer and
reasonable company prospects, was not held for the full
period . . . Wall Street moved up on interest-rate news
but really lacks commitment.
For companies: The cynosure of many invest-
ment eyes, at home and abroad, Western Mining Cor-
poration gave notice of more Kambalda (W.A.) nickel,
at depth and of average assay above three percent . . .
France’s Pechiney and Longreach Oil are now together
in an agreement to explore and develop Longreach’s
copper leases near Mount Isa ... At the Barrier, North
Broken Hill predicts profit down from $7.58m. to $6.3m.
for 1966-67; the interim dividend stays at 10 cents a
share . . . Alcan Australia (previously Australian
Aluminium) slipped from $426,324 to $127,602 in 1966,
blaming lower sales and higher costs.
Concrete and quarrying came up with a burst when
Pioneer Concrete decided to bring the dividend from
12J to 15 percent for the year ending in June . . . Still
depressed, however, is Concrete Industries (Monier),
with earnings, at $909,616, 10 percent lower to Decem-
ber, and from its basic business, too . . . Holding sales
could not sustain Associated Portland Cement Manufac-
turers from a 21.9 percent drop to $1,867,483 for 1966;
10 percent remains on a 14.9 percent earning rate.
Competition and higher costs perplexed AWA in the
period to February and the situation’s much the same
for the next four months . . . Philips Electrical Industries
(Aust.) Pty., owned, of course, in Holland, has a “sub-
stantial” minority interest in Eric Anderson, whose
losses totalled $97,893 to December (previous period
$119,498).
The food front was dented when Anderson Meat
Industries asked its banker for a receiver-manager as
1966-67 losses continue to mount . . . Confidence, though,
pours from Marrickville Holdings, all set for bigger
1966-67 earnings and already telling the world about
higher turnovers; the fight’s still on in margarine . . .
British Tobacco has linked Allied Mills in its bid for
Golden Poultry Farming Industries.
Spurning an offer from Britain’s Viyella, textiler
Davies Coop holds a bait to shareholders of better
profits and higher dividends . . . With an interim 6§
percent Universal Textiles (the STP-Tennyson merger)
bring cheer of a “good” outlook for the rest of the year
... In Victoria, Yarra Falls earned $10,158 to December
and reports improved current sales.
North Queensland merchant Samuel Allen fore-
shadows a record 1966-67 profit after a 10 percent in-
crease over the first half.
Immediately following the U.K.’s nationalisation of
steel, Guest, Keen and Nettlefold put in a bid for local
merchant Brown and Dureau Ltd., which has become
profitable again.


For economic salvation
All aboard the Golden Hind
By CROESUS
MR. lAN SHANNON has arrived on
the Potomac or, at any rate, at
Chicago (where the latest of his three
books on gold has been published) on
what has been a hard and tortuous jour-
ney over countless pages on his per-
sonal crusade to convince the world
where its economic salvation lies. One
feared from the lumbering argument
in his first two books advocating an
increase in the price of gold (“Economic
Functions of Gold,” 1962, and “Inter-
national Liquidity,” 1964) that, like the
Argonauts, he was taking an awfully
long time to get to home. This time, in
“Gold and the American Balance of
Payments,” published by Henry
Regenery Company -(U.S.), he has
streamlined the hull of his Golden Hind
and put up a spinnaker to make better
time.
Of his second book in 1964, I wrote
in THE BULLETIN that “a lot of it
smacks of the general treatment one
expects from an international agency
expert and is of too broad a sweep to
be altogether convincing; this is not
to say his plunges into world economics
are not thought-provoking, but they are
hardly calculated to turn the stubborn
heads of the U.S. Treasury from stick-
ing to 35 dollars an ounce, an attitude
the author finds as incomprehensible
as the general tolerance of ‘muddling
along’ on the liquidity front.” In
deference to such criticism, though may-
be not because of it, Shannon has
thrown much but not all of the woolly
stuff overboard.
He has taken the point that if the
U.S. is to increase the price of gold it
will first have to be convinced that
this would be in its best interests, what-
ever all the other arguments in favor
of it might be. In fact, “even minor
reforms may be accomplished only if
they fit the needs of the powerful,” so
now he’s not so much singling out the
U.S. from the other big monetary
powers as steering his craft at the one
holding the dominating position for
world liquidity.
The big question is whether the U.S.
for all its efforts to reduce the deficit
on its balance of payments, which has
saved the world economy sliding back
for a good many years, has reached the
point of no return irrespective of the
need still further to increase world
liquidity. The U.S. position is certainly
precarious, because, as Shannon points
out, “foreign treasurers know that
they could force a devaluation on the
United States if they all shifted from
dollars to gold.” The reason for this is
that dollar claims of foreigners on the
United States far exceed the present
value of gold at Fort Knox.
Shannon tests all the main alterna-
tives to an increase in the price of gold
against the basic requirement for in-
ternational liquidity of keeping the
United States’ deficit going in face of
the fact that the deficit cannot readily
be financed by the dollar itself. In-
creasing the number of reserve cur-
rencies, for instance, would not do, be-
cause the only way the U.S. could
obtain these other currencies in suffi-
cient quantities would be to run a
balance of payments surplus. So “what-
ever the monetary merits of this pro-
posal to increase the number of reserve
currencies may be, it is no use for
our present needs,” the author says. The
real point is that the use of other
national currencies for international re-
serves does nothing to allow a large
and continuing transfer of capital from
the U.S. required by the rest of the
world.
A second alternative, the use of a
new form of international money, is
not dismissed so bluntly. Shannon
thinks it could succeed if the new
money were created in the “appropri-
ate” manner, and it has some advan-
tages such as being “the one certain
way to control and supervision of the
world economy and of governments.”
It would also promote international
co-operation. Against this, Shannon
thinks such a scheme could easily be
thwarted.
He comes back to the test of keep-
ing U.S. balance of payments going and
believes it fails because the mon‘ey
wou'd have to be created in a manner
which many of its protagonists would
probably find it difficult to accept.
As he sees it, the new money would
have to be given away mostly to the
U.S. to support the U.S. deficit en-
tailed by its export of capital (the
author estimates that about three-
quarters of the development capital
needed around the world in the fore-
seeable future will have to come from
the U.S.).
The Stamp Plan, under which the
new money would go to the under-
developed countries and then, presum-
ably, be exchanged for goods and ser-
vices in the richer ones, is not accept-
able to Shannon either, though I think
his argument against it is slender. It
is possible that the glitter of the higher
gold price alternative has blinded him
to its counter-attractions, at least as a
framework for a solution to the twin
problems of how to provide for appro-
priate increases in both reserves and
development capital and at the same
time sustain the U.S. balance of pay-
ments.
If the solution via an increase in the
price of gold is so superior, why his
insistence that the creation of addi-
tional global international reserves to
allow countries to run temporary
deficits on their balance of payments
should be considered separately from
the provision, of development capital
(which in any case requires the U.S.
to run deficits a long way ahead)?
The gold solution doesn’t provide for
them separately. It wraps them up in
the one big package deal.
One of his criticisms of the Stamp
Plan is that it is conceivable most of
the additional development grants of
SU.S. 5 billion a year it provides for
would be spent outside the U.S. and
this would be lost as support for the
U.S. balance of payments. On this it
seems curious that, although he con-
siders (and dismisses) the case for
tying the creation of reserves to eco-
nomic aid, he doesn’t explore the possi-
bilities of creating new paper money for
the provision of an extra layer of
development capital which could take
the necessary pressure now weighing
on the dollar largely as a result of the
massive export of U.S. capital for over-
seas development.
The process of eliminating the alter-
natives to increasing the price of gold
completed to his own, but not this
reviewer’s, satisfaction, the author pro-
claims the cure-all and names his new
price of SU.S.IOO an ounce for gold as
against the $U.5.35 it has been since
1933. He rests his case by saying ‘‘a
revaluation of gold seems so rational,
timely, and sensible that further positive
support for the case becomes unneces-
sary.”
A rise to SU.S.IOO would mean U.S.
gold reserves would nearly treble and
on the author’s calculations, which I
don’t dispute, this improved cover for
the dollar would allow a U.S. balance
of payments deficit of SU.S. 4 billion
a year for nearly seven years. At the
higher price, new gold production
would be, say, SU.S. 4 billion a year,
and this would give additional strength
not only to the U.S. gold reserves but
also to those of other countries. While
it would mean a bonanza for South
Africa and the U.S.S.R. (which might
be a mixed blessing in U.S. eyes), in
the case of Britain it would certainly
take pressure from sterling and permit
it to resume"'its traditional role in
fertilising overseas development and
international trade.
Incidentally, Mr. R. J. M. Wilkin-
son, chairman of the London Stock
Exchange, who was in Melbourne last
week (see Men and Matters), reassured
me that sterling’s recovery was solidly
based, not only because most of the
bears had closed their positions but also
because U.K. exports were strong and
the internal economy was hardening.
While this is far and away Shannon’s
best and most readable book on gold,
and Washington cannot fail to be
impressed by its deep appreciation of
the problems tackled, it might not be
quite good enough to get the miracle.
But, at any rate, the bogy of inflation,
a rabid reader of books advocating an
increase in the U.S. gold price, is bound
to get a big kick from it.

Some quality in textiles
MINING • SHARE • LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON in Sydney
PEOPLE WHO BUY shares at up to
120 times their latest year’s earnings
are classified as investors with fore-
sight; those who buy textile company
shares yielding better than 8 percent
on well-covered dividends are called
speculators.
But buying shares in leading textilers
like Bradford Cotton to yield 8.5 per-
cent and in Universal Textiles to return
8.1 percent seems a more assured way
of making money than buying into the
mining boom.
The trouble with the textile business
is that the good-quality end is tarred
with the same brush as the inefficient,
badly managed mess (mainly of small
operators) in the wool industry that
spread themselves far and wide, but
make few appearances in the dividend
lists. In the past year or so, textile
share prices have fallen by about 11
percent, yet the outlook for the industry
seems much more assured now than it
did then.
True, there have been some unim-
pressive half-year results from the
major textile companies. Both Brad-
ford Cotton and Universal Textiles (the
STP-Tennyson group) reported lower
profits in the December half-year be-
cause of difficult trading conditions. But
business has picked up markedly after
that temporary downturn—and both
these companies have special factors
going for them that should ensure their
future. In any event, at the worst
their dividends look assured; at best
they face a period of useful profit
growth.
Bradford’s 8| percent fall in net
profit in the December half-year was
despite a sales record—and at present
it is understood that the plant is work-
ing to what the management classes as
“capacity”—full shifts but only five
days a week (no textile industry can
be really efficient with its plant unem-
ployed for almost 30 percent of the
time). The 10 percent dividend appears
to be in no danger whatsoever (it has
already paid its 5 percent interim),
The half-year profit of $651,500 only
falls about $200,000 short of the full
year’s dividend charge and there seems
every prospect that the second half of
the financial year will bring a better
result than the first. But more impor-
tant, the company has yet to show the
full effects of its huge re-equipment
program of recent years,
For Universal Textiles the major
economies that should come from merg-
ing the rival activities of Tennyson and
STP particularly of increased
volume of throughput and rationalised
plant usage have not yet had the
chance to appear, because of the re-
duced consumer demand of the first
half of the current year. Universal’s
new higher 13 percent dividend would
have been covered 2\ times by last
year’s profit, and the company is very
confident indeed about its present
trading position.
Even companies like Yarra Falls,
that have had a dismal spell, now
appear to be on the way back. Last
week’s interim report of a small
$lO,OOO profit against a $43,000 loss
in the same period last year was des-
pite a fall in sales. The major reason
for the profit in these circumstances
appears to be the substantial reduction
in interest payments following the new-
look board’s tough pruning of the
accounts last year, as liabilities were
cut by $2.6 million.
Although it is years since Yarra
Falls paid a dividend, the upward
trend in sales in the second half of the
year, the improvement in its financial
position, the sale of some of its un-
wanted properties, and the company’s
apparent success with its new Kora-
trom crease-resistant, wool-blended
fabrics suggest that a payout may not
be too many years away. In any event,
the recent price of 72 cents for the
$2 shares seems unrealistic in terms of
the $3.50 assets backing much of
which is in property including some
freeholds that are in the books at $1.9
million, but have a VG of $4.5 million.
OTHER COMMENTS the Chartist
has to make on earlier forecasts also
point to further declines for two com-
panies, and a chance of a further rise
(even if a risky one) for another. The
Chartist says:
SWAN BREWERY: A warning was
given in the issue of December 31, 1966,
should sales fall below $2.30. Bearish
implications are indicated at present
for this stock, which could fall to
$1.85-$ 1.90, where the situation would
again call for reassessment.
BROKEN HILL SOUTH: $2.60 was
mentioned also as a critical level and
any fall in price to about $2.45 would
be regarded as a decisive break in
trend. This stock could be influenced
by the overall bearishness of the base
metals section.
WESTERN MINING recorded a new
high of $7.80, which is close to the
The Chartist says:
E. Z. INDUSTRIES’ overall performance since 1960 has been disappointing, par-
ticularly to those investors who bought near the “top” in both 1960 and 1964.
It has now broken the 15 percent primary uptrend held since 1962 with the
sharp decline which has taken prices as low as $2.07 during the current week from
the high point of $2.68 at the beginning of this year. The steeper 30 percent
intermediate uptrend, when prices rose to a high of $2.63 in 1964, was pene-
trated early 1965 and consolidation has since taken place above the $1.90 level
with some “bullish” implications until recently. Investors who wish to avoid
erosion of capital would do well to take advantage of any short-term reaction
or pullback to the trendline, about $2.40, as prices could eventually decline to
the $1.60 level, where the situation would call for reassessment. Last sale price
on 21/3/67 $2.08.

O. T. LEMPRIERE is a better stock
than the market gives it credit for at
$1.15. Investors seem a little uncertain
about the implications for this tin
smelter of the rationalisation moves in
the industry that take effect at the
weekend. On April 1, the company’s
tin smeltipg operations will be sold to
Associated Tin Smelters Pty. Ltd., in
which the Patino group’s Sydney Tin
Smelters (which is closing down its
own operations) and BHP will be equal
partners with Lemprieres.
The merit of this arrangement (apart
from having the big customer, BHP,
tied this way) is that tin smelting costs
are a function of size. The new arrange-
ments will mean that Australian tin
producers will' face lower toll charges
in the local smelter, whose throughput
will rise considerably because it no
longer has to share the business. If toll
charges fall far enough, this could mean
that some proportion of the tin now
exported from Australia in concentrates
for smelting overseas, where toll
charges are cheaper, may well find its
way to the local smelter. At present,
Eempriere’s are employed in smelting
tin for local consumption.
Most of the big new Tasmanian tin
projects seem likely to export their tin
in ore or concentrates. There seems
little likelihood of Tasmanian tin pro-
ducers setting up a rival smelter, despite
encouragement from their State Gov-
ernment, unless their production rises
considerably more than appears in
prospect from the large developments
at present under way at Renison and
Mt. Cleveland. There are certainly no
plans for such a smelter. (At Renison,
by the way, installation of the fuming
plant to improve the rate of metal re-
covery has been delayed at least a year
until production is large enough to
merit its installation.)
The new smelting arrangements mean
that Lemprieres will have to share the
smelting profits with two partners
instead of sharing a competitive market
with one rival but this seems likely
to bring increased returns rather than
any serious long-term reduction in in-
come from tin. And in any event,
Lempriere’s other activities in scrap and
antimony are bringing it increasing
returns. They should do even better,
as a side benefit to Lemprieres is that
the sale of its tin plant will provide
a substantial addition to the company’s
liquidity (after it has paid for its shares
in the new joint company).
Much of the reorganisation involved
in the new smelting arrangements
(which mean considerable additions to
Lempriere’s Sydney plant) was done
during the six months to December and
directors report that it disrupted pro-
duction to some extent. The company
nevertheless managed an 83 percent
profit recovery (following the pre-
vious year’s sharp reverse) and direc-
tors expect the full year to show a
satisfactory improvement in profits.
The significance of this recovery is
that it is despite a 10.2 percent fall
in the value of sales by the parent
company (which runs the tin oper-
ation). But. since the average selling
price of tin was down 14 percent
during, the period, it appears that the
disruption to operations directors speak
of did not prevent a modest rise in the
company’s physical output,
Now that the tin price seems to have
levelled out (and has a steady out-
look), the company does not appear
to face any further stock write-downs in
arriving at profit. This suggests that
smelting profits should be in for a
very sharp rise indexed in coming
months compared with last year,
Nevertheless, Lempriere will still mer-
chandise tia in Australia and so will
still face the consequences of fluctua-
tions in tin prices.

Security Analysis
What earnings
a share
for G. J. Coles?
SINCE LAST WEEK, G. J. Coles &
Coy. Limited’s share price has fallen
one cent and Woolworths’ by two cents.
It is quite inevitable that these tw 7 0
stocks will be compared, because they
were both variety stores originally and
then both moved into food retailing
in a big way. According to
G. J. Coles’ annual reports, the
grocery division now contributes about
27.2 percent of the group net profit be-
fore tax, whereas in 1964-5 this division
contributed 25 percent. Clearly food is
an important and growing item in
Coles’ (and, no doubt, Woolworths’)
scheme of things. Before considering
the implications, it seems a good idea
to take a look at the usual statistics:
Year to June 30 1962 1963 19134 1965 1966

Share prices:
High 149 191 199 161 142
Low 120 130 155 131 107
The first glance at these figures
would see only a flat position. Rates of
return on ordinary capital and on ordin-
ary shareholders’ funds have been more
or less steady over the past five years.
Net tangible assets per share have been
increasing at quite a nice rate; the
drop in 1965-6 was only due to a sub-
stantial transfer from shareholders’
funds to a liabilities account entitled
“Amount set aside for future pensions,
retirements, and long - service leave.”
The net amount standing in this account
at June 30, 1966, was over $3.3 million;
it would be interesting to know how
past profits should be adjusted to give
effect to this large increase in provisions
in retrospect. Over the past five years,
only $616,000 seems to have been
charged against profits in respect of
long-service leave and retiring allow-
ances. The impression could be gained
from this large transfer just made from
shareholders’ funds that this charge
should have been five times greater at
the very least.
However, the total profit earned over
this period was nearly $3B million, so
the effect of a further deduction of $3.3
million would not be very significant.
Sales during this same period have
totalled $lOB3 million. It is worth
noting that the average annual com-
pound rate of increase in sales over
the past five years has been about 6.4
percent. This rate of growth is some-
what greater than the growth of the
total sales of food and groceries through-
out Australia and, while one can only
guess at the rate of growth in all the
goods that Coles market, it is perhaps
safe to assume that it is lower than the
rate of growth in the food area. The
conclusion from this would be that
Coles has increased its share of the
market in the past five years.
This is to be expected in some ways,
because there has been considerable ex-
pansion in selling space. In April, 1965,
Sir Edgar Coles, the chairman and con-
trolling director, outlined in a Press
statement a $2O million expansion plan.
This plan seems to have envisaged the
construction of about seventy new stores
and it was stated that during the six-
month period to December, 1965, new
stores would be opened at the rate of
one a week.
In the 1966 annual report it was
stated that “The*total of freehold and
leasehold properties in the group at
cost and valuation has risen from
$71,869,136 to $82,820,656.” Taking the
figures quoted in the Golden Jubilee
Report, and making additions men-
tioned in subsequent reports, the number
of stores at June 30, 1966, was about:
Variety stores 267
New World Supermarkets 64
Food Markets 265
Country Department Stores . 11
607
It looks as though, in 1965/6, thirty-
nine stores- w'ere added at a cost of
$10,951,520 and sales increased by
$21,073,935. These figures would per-
haps indicate that an average new store
costs about $250,000 and adds about
$500,000 to sales revenue. The follow-
ing table is therefore of some interest:

1965/6 607 250.8 82.8 413 3.03
Although these figures are rough in
the. extreme and could be quite mis-
leading in their absolute terms, the
trends that they indicate are probably
quite correct and certainly what would
be expected. Sales per store are con-
stantly increasing (at least, in money
terms) but the cost of new stores is
rising more rapidly than the increase
in sales.
It is not therefore very surprising to
read in the 1966 annual report that:
“Additional funds were also obtained
by the conclusion of sale and lease-
back arrangements on properties within
the subsidiary companies. Negotiations
are currently proceeding for further
sale and leaseback of properties during
the current year.” Coles’ gearing had
never been very high and generally the
owners of the company have maintained
an equity of at least 60 percent. Sale
and leaseback arrangements might be

STETSON SAXON'
The hat says it! You’re a man who thinks young, dares
to be different whatever your years. The name of the
hat is ‘SAXON’ —a dual personality Stetson you can
wear with ease to the yacht club or a shareholders’
meeting. Note the stitched crown (others will)—just
one of the many points of flattering difference that
distinguishes this great new Stetson. At all leading
menswear stores.
BORN IN AMERICA WORN AROUND THE WORLD
regarded as 100 percent loans and
mean that any equity in them is largely
a contingent one. These arrangements
do, however, impose some quite serious
obligations on the lessee (the original
owner, generally), for the lease is
usually for a long period forty
years is not uncommon on some city
properties and escape clauses can
be quite rigorous.
Another factor which is quite interest-
ing and one certainly wonders what
the effect will be on future profits
is the frequent requirement that the
rental shall increase with retail sales
made in the store subject to the lease.
Such arrangements are very attractive
to the lessor, who is on a “heads I win,
tails you lose” basis in that his return
can only increase, for the base rent is
not reduced if sales decline below the
base figure. He gets a true equity in-
vestment in that his income should rise
over the term of the lease, as well as
getting the equity increase in the
capital value at the end of the lease.
In the past, all the profit benefits
which have arisen from increasing sales
have accrued to the operator; under
these new types of lease some of these
benefits are now passing out of the
operator’s hands. It is not known
whether Coles is contemplating such
leases, just as it is not known whether
such leases are in existence in other
retail organisations. It is to be hoped
that the time is not too far distant
when details of major lease agreements
will have to be disclosed in annual
reports.
A graph included in the 1964 Golden
Jubilee Report showed that net profit
before tax as a percentage of sales
had varied between 4 percent and
about percent during a period of
thirty-six years. In 1965/6, the figure
was 5.7 percent. No trend is apparent
and the most that one could say is that
the average return is likely to be 5
percent of sales. In the period from
1959 to 1966, earnings per share have
been increasing at a faster rate than
the percentage of net profit before tax
to sales, so it might well be concluded
that, provided the net margin can be
maintained, earnings can be expected
to increase in the future at about the
same rate as in the past. This means,
in my view, that the minimum rate of
growth would be about 4 percent per
annum and the maximum might be
about 7J percent per annum.
Taking a reasonably conservative
view, it would not be unreasonable to
pay up to sixteen times earnings for
Coles. The difficulty at this point of
time is to estimate what 1966/7 earn-
ings are likely to be on the increased
capital following last September’s issue.
If the adjusted rate of about 8 cents
per share is maintained, then a price
up to sl.2§ would place a fair value
on the shares.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
The shine could obviously not be rubbed off Western
Mining Corporation, which finished at $8.06 for a net advance
of 56 cents; at one stage on Thursday the price touched
$8.24. W.M.C. companion, Broken Hill South, shared some of
the glamor, putting on 23 cents to $2.86, mainly on phosphate
prospects. Not all miners flourished: Aberfoyle dropped nine
cents and C.R.A. 16 cents. Among industrials, John Lysaght
climbed an impressive 14 cents to $2.82. Marrickville Holdings’
report meant an 11 cent fillip to $1.07. Berlei, at $2.35, picked
up seven cents. Meat processor F. J. Walker shed 15 cents.

Behind the balance sheets
Lysaghts go to market
THE BIG CHANGES at John Lysaght
(Aust.) Ltd. are not only in its man-
agement personnel (see Men and Mat-
ters), they are also in its products, its
productivity, and its prospects. Less
evident, but equally important, is a
significant change of emphasis away
from the heavy concentration on pro-
duction to a healthy awareness of the
problems of marketing. These changes
are all for the best. The company now
has a more interesting look for inves-
tors than at any time during its up-
and-down six-year life on the Stock
Exchange lists.
For these basic changes have not yet
really been reflected to anything like
their full extent in the company’s
accounts. The recently announced
profit for 1966 gave only the first in-
dications of better times to come. And
these showed that, despite a dismal first
half of the year, the company was
climbing out of the previous year’s
trough. But the most impressive thing
about this was that the pre-tax profit
rise of $133,000 (as second-half earn-
ings more than offset the drop of more
than a million dollars in the first
half) was earned despite a further fall
in sales.
So the ratio of profits to sales has
risen from 4.8 percent in 1964 (and
only 4.3 percent in 1965) to 5 percent
in 1966 a year in which so much
capacity was so clearly under-employed
as demand for existing products fell
away because of the recessed state of
consumer industries, and as demand for
new products had not yet been built up.
If this can be achieved in a year in
which so many things were running
against Lysaghts, then the prospects for
improvement in these ratios (and in
net profit) when things get better are
striking. For motor-vehicles, domes-
tic appliances, and rural buildings are
major users of Lysaght products; 1966
was a dreadful year for all these, 1967
promises to be a better one and things
should be much better in 1968.
Management itself looks to the
current year’s results with cautious
optimis.m, but it seems clear from orders
that sales will be a good deal higher
(more than offsetting last year’s down-
turn from sl3sm. to $129m.).
There seems little doubt that
Lysaghts has yet to get the full benefits
of much of the new plant installed in
recent times. In the six years since, and
including 1961, the company has spent
$35m., largely on new plant at Port
Kembla, and at last balance date had
capital expenditure of ss.Bm. authorised
by the board and outstanding. Installa-
tions included three continuous anneal-
ing and galvanising lines, a high-speed
coil temper mill with ancillary coil
annealing equipment, a continuous
strip painting line, a cold-reduced
electrical steel sheet and coil project,
a continuous annealing furnace for
Sankey electrical laminations at New-
castle, and open coil annealing equip-
ment at Port Kembla.
The company is now entering a
trough in capital investment which
should allow substantial improvement
in pre-tax profits as the new plant runs
in, and markets build up. But invest-
ment allowances (which minimised tax
by $834,000 in 1966 will taper off. This
will require extra effort to register
equal net profit performance, but that
should present little trouble.
The recent lengthy program of
capital works was financed from
Lysaght's profit retentions and depreci-
ation provisions (including a capital
reserve created by providing in excess
of the figure required to write off the
original cost of fixed assets, to take
account of the reduced purchasing
power of money) and by the 1961
public issue (three million $2 shares
at $4) which raised sl2m. Right up
to December, 1965, the company had
a substantial proportion of this in short-
term investments, which suggests a
rather extravagant desire for liquidity,
or a miscalculation of the timing of
capital needs. The heavy capital in-
vestment has been accompanied by a
decrease in staff (down 700 to an
average 5477) in the last two years,
giving added economies (although some
of this fall could be due to the fall in
sales).
Although management prefers not
to speak of greater efficiency because it
supports the suggestion there was in-
efficiency before, it readily admits to
higher productivity, with resultant lower
unit costs. The growth of the Aus-
tralian market has justified more
sophisticated methods of production,
such as replacement of the hot steel
rolling mill with a modern high-speed
cold reduction plant. But it also is
apparent that Lysaghts have improved
their efficiency in other areas, such as
marketing, that desperately needed im-
provement.
Lysaght started off unhappily in the
public eye with maiden profit and
dividend below expectations. A world
oversupply of sheet steel products be-
came evident in 1961 and 1962 and
as import restrictions were lifted in
Australia, Lysaght had to meet imports
competition which at times has amount-
ed to dumping. However, in May,
1966, Japan agreed not to dump sheet
steel, and the position seems to have
stabilised. Auto and appliance makers
can buy (and have bought) imported
steel, and Lysaght’s products for the
building industry have to compete with
other local products, so that manage-
ment these days is bound to watch the
price in both areas.
Supplied by BHP with the basic raw
material, Lysaght has been squeezed in
the past between the monopoly supplier
and imports. In January, 1962, Lysaght
anticipated Japanese imports by revis-
ing their prices for uncoated products
downwards. In February, 1965, and
August, 1966, higher cost of raw
materials from BHP necessitated price
rises for sheet and coil products, even
though Lysaght did not fully pass on
the increase. Higher zinc prices caused
a price review for zinc-coated products
in August, 1964. During the ’sos, when
the developing auto and white goods
industries created steel shortages,
Lysaght, like many another industrial
company, was preoccupied with pro-
duction.
The possibility of another steel com-
pany starting up in Australia in
opposition to BHP does not draw from
Lysaght management any crystal - ball
reflections, but the development of iron
ore deposits in W.A. and Tasmania,
plus the nationalisation of the iron and
steel activities of Lysaght’s English
parent, does make the position in Aus-
tralia more fluid than it has been since
BHP moved from Broken Hill. The
chairman of the Guest Keen and
Nettlefolds group, which holds 80 per-
cent of Lysaght’s capital, surveyed the
Australian scene last December, and
the international company has just bid
sl.lm. cash for the locally listed Brown
and Dureau, illustrating their interest
in this country. Companies like Brown-
built (which is also installing a con-
tinuous strip painting line) could have
some appeal to Lysaghts, despite the
market’s disappointment when the
widely rumored bid turned out instead
to be for its neighbor on the share list.
Market judgment of Lysaght as an
investment is more sober than in the
heady days of 1961. Allowing for the
share split, the shares which were
placed at the equivalent of $3.25 and
which sold on the first day of trading
as high as $4.07 are today available
(without watering by issues in the in-
terim) at around $2.80, where they
yield 3.9 percent in income and 7.5 per-
cent on earnings. This is a much more
reasonable starting point for investors,
even though it is top price for this
calendar year so far. They should this
time be a rewarding purchase.

For income
CAGA reasonably sound
By PELIAS in Melbourne
COMMERCIAL AND GENERAL
Acceptance Corporation performed
rather poorly in the December half-
year, especially in the light of results
from its competitors in the hire-purchase
and general financing world. As
might be expected, the $1 shares have
fallen to a low point of $1.35. While
one would be hesitant to recommend
buying the shares for growth at this
level, it seems a reasonably solid stock
for investors seeking income to put
their money in. The yield from divi-
dends is 7.4 percent and seems unlikely
to go any higher.
If profits in the current half-year
are maintained (as they were in the
December half), then the group’s annual
dividend will be covered about one-
and-a-half times. The payout has been
ten percent every year but one since
the group was listed. The exception
was a six percent dividend in the first
year on the public lists. Even a slight
profit dip this year would not endanger
the payout; directors seemed determined
to maintain a ten percent annual divi-
dend no matter how narrow the cover.
It was held at this level in 1960-61,
although earning rate reached an all-
time low of 12.3 percent.
There are, of course, several factors
adding to the group’s solidarity. Among
them is the Commercial Banking Com-
pany of Sydney’s 40 percent share inter-
est, a strong liquid position, sizable
reserves, and the large margin which
assets hold over liabilities. The move
by banks into unsecured lending will
take a lot of business from groups
whose main business is in hire purchase,
personal loans, and other general con-
sumer credit, but CACA has been re-
ducing its dependence on such lines
and should 'be less affected by bank
competition than some of its fellow
financiers.
In 1965-66, the proportion of business
found through consumer credit fell from
64.8 percent to 56.3 percent. Secured
commercial loans rose from 30.1 per-
cent to 36.3 percent of the total, leasing
items from 4.6 percent to 6.6 percent,
and the financing of dealer stocks from
0.5 percent to 0.8 percent. The return
on these items may not be as great as
in consumer credit, but costs of man-
agement are lower and security is
greater. The trend away from consumer
credit is believed to have continued in
the current year, the best example prob-
ably being the deal with Anthony
Squires. Shareholders sometimes
shudder at how closely the group
becomes tied with companies needing
money, but, on the whole, directors
seem to know exactly what they are
doing. The successful dealings with the
ailing Factors group provided strong
evidence of this.
Along with lAC (which is apparently
the strength behind Bebarfalds at the
moment), CAGA is establishing itself
as a leader in this type of business, one
w'hich finance companies look like
relying on more heavily in future years
unless one of these deals comes badly
unstuck and unless there are still more
problems still to emerge from the Aus-
tralian Equity Corporation subsidiary
acquired almost two years ago.
For investors seeking income, the
shares have some appeal, but the com-
pany’s current lack of growth leaves
the investor after quicker capital gains
in this industry with many better
opportunities in the market.
THE FROZEN FOOD business is
supposed to be dreadfully competitive,
so one can’t help but be surprised by
Frozen Food Industries; the company
has been just too successful ever since
the day it w'as listed in 1963, while
others have been suffering from sharply
reduced profit margins. There has
~• r i
been a string ot remarkable profit
A r rr .
increases and two new issues. The
i a “ S „'" eWS " Pr ° f,t , |U ,T P fr ,° m
$86,000 to $116,000 in the December
half, returning 31 percent on capital
on an annual basis. Putting it another
way, the company maintained the peak
earning rate achieved in the full 1965-66
year on capital increased by a one-
for-four issue and the proceeds of
the issue were not in the group’s coffers
until the final quarter of the six months.
The growth is obviously continuing
and the outlook is so good that Mel-
bourne’s leading broking house has
recommended the shares, despite the
$1.70 they are fetching and the almost
leader-class dividend yield of 4.1 per-
cent.
The way things are going, share-
holders should see another new issue
before the calendar 1967 runs out. They
may even enjoy another dividend lift
if earning rate rises again. As it is,
the maintenance of last year’s full
(and higher) 14 percent rate will give
them an effective lift because it is
payable on 25 percent higher capital.
Production is currently running at
such a rate that the group is drawing
substantial benefits from lower unit
costs and the dominant position it has
won with its Chiko rolls, fish cakes,
and hamburger lines. Further growth
is inevitable as long as the success of
these products continues. In the Decem-
ber half of 1967-68, profits should get
a further boost from the opening of a
new factory at Keon Park.
Logic may insist that the company
cannot go on like this forever, subject
as its products are to fashion and the
vagaries which large-scale advertising
brings to the consumers of instant foods.
However, it would seem that Frozen
Food’s run is not yet over and specula-
tors should have little trouble in get-
ting their pound of flesh from the
shares. For the more stable investor, it
must be said that the current dividend
yield puts a bit of a ceiling on the
shares price, one which can only be
lifted by a share issue or dividend in-
crease. If neither occurs this year, the
price will certainly drop.
Mining
Hamersley: the Japanese for
leading, everlasting
OF HAMERSLEY, what more can be
said? When the prospectus becomes
available in a week or so it can only
be an anti-climax; already sufficient
information is available to show the
magnitude of the operation. From areas
containing three thousand million tons
of haematite iron ore plus 15(J(J million
r r ■. •
tons of limomte iron ore the company
is shipping iron ore to Japan, Europe,
and the United Kingdom at a rate of
4.8 million tons this year, which will
grow to six million tons next year, and
7.5 million tons in 1972 all covered
by firm contracts totalling 90 million
tons of iron ore and iron oxide pellets
and worth more than $750 million.
The company confidently expects to
receive additional ore to bring annual
shipments up to ten million tons by
1972. On such shipments, reserves of
ore a re sufficient for well over three
hundred years!
Such figum as these come so c l ose
immorta lity that down-to-earth com-
. } ,. a . r\ > , • t
pansons are difficult. On the basis or

Limited will have a life of ovei.
years; Broken Hill South s Cobai mines
have reserves of ore sufficient for about
35 years; while Mount Isa s stated
reserves contain ore for about 20 years
operations. The Japanese characters
forming the word “Hamersley have
the literal meaning of “leading, ever-


lasting mine,” and there can be no
doubting the fitness of such a title.
On the level of actual production
rates, however, some more realistic
comparisons are possible. Hamersley’s
1972 contracted shipments of 7,450,000
tons compare with BHP’s current annual
production of iron ore of 7,000,000
tons, but BHP mines four areas (Iron
Monarch and Iron Prince in South
.Australia and Cockatoo and Koolan
Islands at Yampi Sound in Western
Australia) to extract this quantity of
ore. Next on the scale would be
Thiess-Peabody-Mitsui Pty. Ltd., which
by next year will be extracting
4,250,000 tons of coal per annum, while
Mount Isa is currently mining at the
rate of about 3,600,000 tons per annum
and expects to be extracting almost
5,000,000 tons per annum when new
underground equipment is installed
later this year. Mount Isa’s production
comes from an underground mine and
hence is not really comparable if
anything, an underground mine pro-
ducing 5,000,000 tons of ore per annum
(worth in Mount Isa’s case rather less
than $2O per ton) is perhaps a larger
undertaking than an opencut (such as
Hamersley) producing 10 million tons
per annum (worth in Hamersley’s case
about $8.30 per ton).
Although the two operations may not
be comparable on a technical basis,
Mount Isa is commonly considered to
be Australia’s largest mining company
and is certainly the largest single
mining operation on the Stock
Exchange lists. For these reasons it can
provide an interesting standard for
evaluating . Hamersley. Mount Isa’s
capital of $47,641,576 is contained in
95,283,152 50-cent shares which are
selling at about $3.80, placing a market
value on the enterprise of $362,000,000
(last year’s profit was $16.8 million);
Hamersley is placing a price of $2.50
on its 100,000,000 50-cent shares, giving
a total value of $250,000,000 for the
enterprise (and estimated profits of
$22,000,000 in 1972). While
Hamersley’s profit comes from the
mining of a* much less volatile metal,
the company’s estimates of future profits
are no doubt conservative to a degree,
and the comparisons above suggest that
there is scope for a market value of
perhaps $3.50 for Hamersley shares
when they are traded on the Stock
Exchanges.
The information now available on
Hamersley also provides a good basis
for evaluating other iron ore projects
notably the Mount Goldsworthy
Mining Associates, in which Consoli-
dated Goldfields Australia Limited is
a one-third participant with Cyprus
Mines Corporation of Los Angeles and
Utah Construction and Mining Com-
pany of San Francisco. The Mount
Goldsworthy project is rather modest
when compared with Hamersley
proven reserves at Mount Goldsworthy
are 40 million tons of iron ore com-
pared with Hamersley’s 500 million
proved; Mount Goldsworthy’s contracts
are for 19,625,000 tons of lump iron
ore and iron ore fines against Hamers-
ley’s 90 million tons of lump ore, fines,
and pellets. Nevertheless, annual ship-
ments from Mount Goldsworthy will
be at the respectable rate of 3 million
tons per annum on existing contracts
(the first shipment was made in July
last year).
Capital cost per ton looks like being
lower for Mount Goldsworthy than it
is for Hamersley, based on contracted
tonnages and the need for Hamersley
to spend about $l6O million on a
pelletising plan, by April next year.
Offsetting its higher capital costs,
Hamersley’s contracts extend over six-
teen years, against Mount Goldsworthy's
n T , ~X f . / ,
sev n years. The difference mcap. al
costs, plus a shorter rail haul (70 miles
against Hamersley s 182 mrles), should
a low Mount Goldsworthy s profit per
-ton to be fairly similar to the $2.20 per
ton which Hamersley expects to make.
t this rate annual shipments of 3
million tons would give Mount Golds-
worthy a profit of $6.6 million.
Using the same arithmetic as CRA
and Kaiser, if Hamersley’s expected
flow of profits of $22 million are worth
$250 million today, then Mount Golds-
worthy’s estimated profits of $6.6
million should be worth $75 million,
Consolidated Goldfields Australia
Limited has a one-third interest in the
project, so its share of this would be
$25 million, or $1.14 on each of its. 22
million shares. At current prices the
value of the company’s holdings in Bel-
lambi Coal, Mount Lyell, Lake View
and Star, Associated Minerals, Wyong
Minerals, Commonwealth Mining
Investments, Zip Holdings (N.Z.), and
Renison are worth approximately $2.50
per share (exact valuation is impossible
due t 0 l a ok information concerning
Goldfields holding in Lake View and
Star). Placing a value of $1.14 per
w 3re c ° m P an y s interest in
Mount Goldsworthy gives a total figure

development of the largest iron ore
export contract, that obtained by the
M^unt Iron Qre C( J e
Limited, in which BHp and F th ’
Colonial Sugar Refining Companv
Limited’s consortium each have a 30
percent interest with American Metal
Climax Incorporated holding 25 per-
cent, Selection Trust Limited, of the
U.K., holding 5 percent, and Mitsui
and C . Itoh a 10 percent interest. Over
the next three years this project will
absorb at least $175 million in prepara-
tion for shipments of iron ore totalling
100 million tons over the 20 years corn-
mencing in 1969.
Commodities
New problems about to face copper
THE PRESSURES on copper were
again shown most clearly in U.K. con-
sumption figures for January, just
released. Consumption of the metal
in all forms was down 15 percent on
the January, 1966, level 54,152 tons
against 63,944 tons.
But the copper market, while weak-
ening under pressure from these
statistics, has a new problem approach-
ing its doorstep. About now Kennecott
Copper faces renewal of its Chilean
labor contracts, while mid-year will see
domestic U.S. workers putting on the
pressure for a share in the current
buoyant profits.
Possibly of longer-term significance
are the current Zambian disputes, in-
volving as they do questions of racial
friction. The white technicians can
always pack up and leave for less
troubled spots if they feel their demands
are being handled too roughly.
If consumers’ concern about these dif-
ficulties is holding up LME prices, the
result of a relatively peaceful wages
settlement could be interesting. Off-
course strikes are perpetually copper’s
problem, and the need to fill the gaps
left in output at various times and
places must be allowed for when
assessing the copper supply-demand bal-
ance for the longer term,
But it is difficult not to feel some
doubts about a recent U.S. producer’s
statement that a 600,000-odd ton sur-
pbis of capacity over demand, which
has been forecast for 1970, will not
actually result in surplus production—

REPORTS FROM Japan’s talkative
steel industry say that first shipments of
BHP’s Groote Eylandt manganese were
not too well received. “Consumers were
not happy with the quality of the
material,” the trade sources say, but
additional limited tonnages have been
purchased nevertheless.
British Metal Corporation’s Mt. Syd-
ney mine and the Bell Brothers Hold-
ings Ltd. project are the other main
local sources both in Western Aus-
tralia.
Worldwide, a surplus is now de-
veloping, with little chance of steel out-
put picking up sufficiently to absorb
the extra supplies for some time.
Although, as with many other com-
modities, Australia has special attrac-
tions as a source for Japan’s manganese,
the pressure will probably be felt by
the local suppliers.
FEBRUARY’S SHARP setback has left
the cocoa market with a firm under-
tone, and steady gains have brought
prices near to the £stg.33s a ton peak
set that month. Most of the main
African producers are believed to be
sold out of cocoa, while chocolate-
makers in several areas are thought
to be low on stocks.
Russian buying has been a key
factor in the past weeks’ firmness. The
next few weeks will see the latest
consumption figures in U.S. and
Europe, and the future trend will
then be clearer.
The Pacific Island cocoa producers
also grow copra the palms provide
shade for the cocoa crop and prices
for this product remain at depressed
levels, dampening the benefits from
the cocoa buoyancy.
JAPANESE SYNTHETIC fibre out-
put will increase by 15 or 20 percent
this year, according to Teijin, a lead-
ing producer. In 1966, production rose
21.3 percent, despite rapid growth in
the competing international synthetic
textile industry.
The European and U.S. plant in-
stallation program has evidently not
proceeded as fast as the Japanese ex-
pected and intensifying world com-
petition has not materialised, according
to Teijin.
The textile market could hardly be
called easy at present, and the Jap-
anese views do not augur well for any
improvement in the near future.

No ruffle in
the markets
for St. Patrick
IT’S THE SAME every year. We
just manage to survive the March Ides
only to have April Fool’s Day descend
on us. Not that April Fool’s Day much
affects the market. Most companies
are too sober-minded to test their share-
holders’ gullibility.
Nor did St. Patrick’s Day cause
much of a ruffle in the market this
year. On the same day last year the
Irish in Australia must have been feel-
ing more sentimental, judging by the
5-cent rise recorded in Shamrock
Brewery shares. This year, Shamrock
couldn’t even muster a sale!
Going back once again to last year,
I wrote in one of my articles that
buying L. J. Hooker and Concrete
Industries would probably prove a
more worthwhile proposition than the
purchase of any two of the blue chip
favorites. Although both Hookers and
Concrete Industries have since risen
20 percent in market price, I still feel
justified in making the same remark.
With -Mr. Campbell at the helm of
Hookers, this company has not only
survived the drought but could be
returning to the dividend lists later this
year. So also could Concrete Industries.
Looming over Concrete Industries in
the past three years has been the North
West Cape project. Originally taken on
as a joint venture with the U.S.-based
Hardeman S.A. group, Concrete
Industries was forced to take full
responsibility of the project in May,
1965, when the Hardeman group found
itself tottering on the edge of financial
disaster. In the 1965/66 financial year,
a total amount of $5,750,000 had been
built up in a contingency account to
provide for claims and counter claims
between the U.S. Navy and Concrete
Industries.
This month the U.S. Navy Appeals
Board settled the first two claims in
favor of Concrete Industries. As the
suspect steel claim was worth just on
$U.5.1.8m., the prospect of an early
resumption of dividend payments and
even a capital return seem much
closer.
To get a proper perspective on Con-
crete Industries, it’s necessary to briefly
review the development of the com-
pany. Formed in 1936, it was not until
1960 that the company moved into the
big league. It achieved this by simply
increasing the capital fivefold, from
$3.2m. in 1959 to $16.9m. in 1962. The
increase was accomplished in two separ-
ate steps. Step one was in 1960, a year
which could justly be called the year
of the takeover. In quick succession C.
C. Engineering, C. C. Diecasting, Hurll
and Douglas, Standard Portland
Cement, and Jaywoth Besser joined
the group. As a result, precision engin-
eering, diecasting, and Portland cement
were added to the basic activity of
manufacturing concrete products. Step
two was in March, 1961, when the
capital was further increased by 50 per-
cent with a l-for-3 bonus issue and
l-for-4 par issue.
A huge capital to service, combined
with the failure of the North West Cape-
project and the Hurstville Shopping
Centre, resulted in the share price falling
from about the $1.50 level to 30 cents.
While Concrete Industries remains over-
capitalised, the problems of the North
West Cape project and Hurstville are
mainly behind it. A recovery to the par
value of 50 cents does not seem to be
too optimistic.
Buying shares under par seems to be
the rule of the week. In fact, the
second purchase of the week, Latec,
is under a quarter of its par value. One
of the boom financial companies of
the 19505, the bubble burst in 1961
when losses of s3m. were disclosed.
This loss was eclipsed by a s7m. loss
in 1962.
Although we find Latec still in
receivership five years later, it is slowly
rehabilitating itself. With the outside
debts gradually- being repaid, the
creditors have been subdued. On the
trading side, the motels and hotels
are now making a fair contribution to
group profits. And the other major
activity, homebuilding, conducted
through the subsidiary Mala Homes,
also is showing good progress. In
response, the market has been marking
the shares up cent by cent. Let’s hope
this practice continues. I bought 1000
shares at 12 cents.
Before I close the diary, I have to
admit that I went close to buying
Anderson Meat just before the receiver-
ship was announced. One almost has
to have a sixth sense to realise that a
share has fallen too much to be an
ordinary supply-demand situation.
The only sale this week was the
Kathleen Investments at $2.85. The
slide in the share to $2.60 frightened me,
so I was happy to take a loss on the
rebound.

Man on the Land
A prolonged Kennedy Round
in the offing
THE KENNEDY ROUND of tariff
talks may not end in June this year as
expected. But that does not mean that
anything positive will necessarily be
forthcoming. In fact, the chances are
that the talks will drag on indefinitely,
the negotiating secretariats and staff will
assume a more and more permanent
appearance, and the problems will re-
main. Without power, what is an
agricultural policy, or any kind of
policy? Just a lot of talk.
The reason for our lack of faith in
the outcome of the talks is the recent
statement of Herschel D. Newsom,
Master of the National Grange of the
U.S.A. (one of the two most powerful
U.S. farmer groups), that his organisa-
tion is “firmly committed to seeking
an expansion of the U.S. trade negotiat-
ing authority,” at the Kennedy Round,
beyond June 30 the date on which
the present U.S. authority to participate
expires. Newsom added that trade ex-
pansion in agricultural commodities
“must come logically and gradually
through effective international com-
modity agreements, rather than from
a simple lowering of tariff price levels.”
This is most revealing, as the aim of
the Kennedy talks (as declared by the
late President Kennedy) was a general
lowering of tariff walls.
Significantly, Mr. Newsom has been
added by the Johnson Administration
to the U.S. negotiating team at the
Kennedy talks. His words, accordingly,
carry even more weight than they might
in normal circumstances. They seem to
suggest that, from the U.S. farmer’s
point of view, the other nations of the
world can talk as much as they like.
But if there are to be any agreements,
then they will be made to suit the
U.S. farmer.
In fairness it must be conceded that
the U.S. farmer has had cause to com-
plain over the trends in the years since
World War 11. His own income, rela-
tively, has decreased. Since 1946, nearly
12 million small farmers and their
families have left the land to seek jobs
in the cities. Unable to cope with ver-
tical integration and the other develop-
ments in recent years, these people,
originally share croppers and small
landholders, are part of the problem
of U.S. cities. They have become redun-
dant.
In all the time that this has been
happening, the United States has given
food away at a rate never before even
contemplated in the history of man-
kind. Sometimes the recipients have
been grateful* sometimes not. Sometimes
friends oUthe U.S. have accused her of
destroying potential markets for farm
produce. The change, under President
Johnson, has been dramatic. Exports
on a commercial basis are playing an
increasingly important role in U.S.
farming and- this is what is at the heart
of Mr. Newsom’s remarks about the
Kennedy Round.
Ten years ago only seven U.S. farm
States had exports valued at $lOO mil-
lion or more. In 1965-66 there were
20. Ten years ago exports provided
10 cents in every dollar earned by U.S.
farmers. Last year it was 17 cents in
every dollar. The 1965-66 earnings from
farm exports were an all-time record,
at $6700 million.
The U.S. approach, now and in the
future, would seem to imply that the
U.S. will be a competitive seller, to
those who can pay, and a generous,
but not extravagant, giver fo those who
indicate that they are prepared to help
themselves be helped. In his message
to the U.S. Congress on the India food
crisis President Johnson sought, and
got, approval for gift food amounting
to $25 million. Australians should give
Johnson credit for this particularly
when we are told that our own Govern-
ment is still deciding whether it can
afford to provide the shipping fee for
the gift milk sent in to collection
centres by members of the public here.
Of course we have done more than
that for India, but let us be realistic
about our foreign aid program. The
U.S., officially, is not going to be very
impressed by charges emanating from
Australian farmers that America is
undercutting us for farm produce in
the commercial market-places around
*the world.
Expanding on the India aid pro-
gram, President Johnson spelled out
the broad approach. It can hardly be
denied that it is a realistic approach.
He said that the war on hunger could
only be won by the determined efforts
of the developing nations themselves.
International aid could help, but only
if these nations pursued well-conceived
and executed long-range plans of their
own. He said the assistance of the
international community must be organ-
ised in a coalition of the advanced and
developing nations. Food was -scarce.
Nowhere was there a real surplus.
There was a rising curve of population
and a lagging curve of agricultural pro-
duction. All advanced nations, includ-
ing those which imported food, must
share the burden of feeding the hungry
and building their capacity to feed
themselves.
This last bit comes at an appropriate
time. In Australia we have the biggest
crop of wheat in history, nearly 450
million bushels. The Wheat Board
simply does not have markets for all
this wheat (the most Australia has ever
exported before in a single year is 270
million bushels; this, perhaps, might be
lifted to 350 million this year). The
wheat stabilisation plan is to be re-
viewed this year by the Federal Govern-
ment, and the s wheatgrower organisa-
tions are making various suggestions.
These include increasing the quantity
covered by the guaranteed price itself
(at present 153 cents per bushel).
Non-wheatgrower critics (including
Mr. E. J. Donath) have been making
other suggestions. These, in various
ways, would restrict the acreage put
under crop and the inevitable burden
on the Australian taxpayer. There is
nothing new in this argument and
counter-argument. It has been going
on for years. Always, in the last decade,
there has been the official view (usually
expressed by Mr. McEwen) that the
Kennedy Round might come up with
something which would save the day.
It seems, however, that the Kennedy
Round might not come up with any-
thing much this year, or next year
either. Serious discussion on the sub-
ject of acreage controls, whether by
direct methods or a reduction of the
guaranteed price, or the quantity under
guarantee, in order to dissuade plant-
ings, would therefore seem likely in
coming months.
In this discussion, which will be
heated (we can be certain of that),
someone just might introduce the idea
of an improved aid program. Every-
one will agree that wheat (and sugar,
dairy produce, and fruit, etc.) in over-
supply should not be permitted to go
to waste. Nor should it be overlooked
that trade (at least sometimes) follows
aid.

The abundancy
of bushflies
OUR CITY COUSINS are currently
concerned about flies and are said to
hold rather far-fetched and fanciful
notions about them (8., Feb. 11).
Country people generally are aware
that there are many kinds of flies and
that houseflies and bushflies, which to
the casual observer look practically
identical, are quite different species,
though both may occur together, some-
times abundantly.
In short, when a fly buzzes some-
one in Hyde Park, that person is
unlikely to be able' to say whether it
is a bushfly or a housefly. What the
chances are that it is one or the other
is anybody’s guess, but it is a pity that
information on this point is unavail-
able. It would help our urbanites and

TON MILLER, Registrar.
suburbanites to put their real or imag-
ined fly problem in proper perspective.
Away out in the country the over-
whelming likelihood is that a pestering
fly is a bushfly (Musca vetustissima).
Bushflies rarely enter houses, but
houseflies (M. domestica) may be quite
plentiful at some considerable distance
from dwellings.
Dr. K. R. Norris, a CSIRO ento-
mologist, after studying bushflies scien-
tifically in the countryside around
Canberra, is now able to provide some
real facts about their habits and be-
haviour. Some of his findings and con-
clusions, therefore, would apply strictly
only to the Canberra environment. Bear-
ing this in mind, the first fact to face,
in Norris’ own words, is that “it is not
possible to indicate practical means of
reducing bushfly abundance.”
Perhaps our enthusiastic advocates of
fly suppression might care to challenge
this pessimistic counsel. Possibly some
measure of control may be attainable
in our big cities, because the bushfly’s
main breeding ground is the dung of
grazing animals. Cow dung is, by a
wide margin, their preferred variety.
They can utilise sheep droppings in
spring and early summer and fresh
horse manure. Failing these harbors
they will breed in the dung of dogs,
pigs, and humans, and in the paunch
contents of dead herbivores. There is
not a shred of evidence in support
of the common notion that these flies
breed in grass tussocks and decaying
vegetable matter or garbage. From this
it would seem that, if cities get rid of
their dogs and horses and if the human
population uses the latrines that modern
society has provided, they might make
some progress toward reducing the
nuisance caused by bushflies.
On the other hand, Norris has found
that the bushfly has a long and active
life. When the weather suits them they
can live for upward of two months
and in this time they could travel long
distances. He released marked flies
and trapped some of them 3J miles
away a mere 48 hours later. This
seems to suggest that many of the bush-
flies to be found near the centres of
our large, sprawling cities may be
migrants from the outlying dairying
districts. Certainly, migrant flies from
the grazing lands round about would
comprise the bulk of the population
in the smaller inland cities and country
towns.
The bushfly population in the country
around Canberra reached an estimated
density of 9000 per acre during Decem-
ber, at which time it is at its peak.
None appear from late May to late
October. In January, numbers are still
high, but not nearly as great, never-
theless, as in the previous month. To
account for this decline, Norris pos-
tulates that as summer progresses and
the amount of grass becomes less the
grazing animals eat less and dung less.
Moreover, and maybe more importantly,
the nature of the dung from animals
on dry fodder changes and it may no
longer provide such good conditions
for the fly’s larvae.
Norris has carefully read the scien-
tific literature on an overseas species
(M. sorbens) which is very closely
related to our bushfly. He points out
that this species breeds principally in
isolated human stools, but does not
breed in accumulations of human
faeces as in unsewered latrines. By
implication, our bushfly may behave
similarly. He considers, therefore, that
the bushfly population in coastal holi-
day resorts could be derived mainly
from unburied human excrement
deposited in the bush. At anv rate, he
has found large numbers of the im-
mature stages of the fly lurking under-
neath these individual droppings. The
careless habits of the Aboriginal popu-
lation, estimated to number some
300,000 when Governor Phillip arrived
with his unruly lot of Europeans, would
have enabled the bushfly to flourish.
M. sorbens, incidentally, reaches
population densities in the Middle East
and elsewhere that make our fly
numbers seem minute by comparison.
Only narrow-minded tourists could re-
gard us as being fly-ridden. Apart from
the severe irritation and distraction
that bushflies cause people as they go
about their affairs outdoors, they may
provoke eye infections. Some people
have claimed that, in addition, they
cause stomach and bowel infections, but
there is no compelling evidence of this.
Several months ago, Dr. Norris and
his colleague, Dr. Waterhouse, who is
the Chief of the CSIRO Division of
Entomology, announced the identifica-
tion of an effective repellent. It is di-
N-propyl isocinchomeronate and is the
active principal in a number of con-
venient aerosols now readily available.
One application of this chemical will
afford good relief for several hours.
Not all bushflies are dissuaded by it
from making an actual landing, but
almost all those that do fly off again
pretty fast.
Even better repellents may eventually
be found. The only other chances in
sight of combating the bushfly seem
to lie in finding a means of breaking
up the droppings of large herbivores or
in finding other insects to prey on the
fly. Dung beetles have been intro-
duced from overseas and their capacity
to disperse dung and thrive under Aus-
tralian conditions is now being tested.

Seeds of
discontent
In the Man on the Land section
(8., March 4) an article appeared
under the title “Seeds of Discontent.”
This contained many errors and there-
fore gave an unfortunate and mislead-
ing picture of the agreement between
the University of Western Australia and
Geo. Fielder & Coy., of Sydney.
One ton of Uniwager seed has been
made available to Fielders for rapid
seed build-up in India. This bold move
was undertaken to produce for farmers
more of this potentially valuable
variety in one season rather than in
two. What your correspondent fails
to mention is that the whole of the
cost and the risk of this venture is
borne by Fielders and that two tons,
i.e., twice the amount loaned to
Fielders, of the original Uniwager seed,
is also being made available to farmers
experienced in clover-seed production
for increase in the present season.
The article also states that the agree-
ment “would include signing away the
(University’s) right to engage, with-
out Fielders’ approval, in the bulk
production and marketing of new 7 seed
varieties developed from its own re-
search over the next six years.” There
is no such condition in the agreernent
and Fielders do not have exclusive or
priority rights to any of the products
of University research. The University
maintains absolute freedom of action in
its research and development activities
under the proposed agreement and will
be helped to increase these activities
in the interests of farmers by the fin-
ancial contributions from Fielders.
The article states further that “the
decision was made without approval of
the Institute’s trustees, some of whom
are exceedingly put out.” The fact is
that the Institute has no trustees. It is
a part of the University and is respon-
sible only to the governing body of the
University, the Senate. The Institute
receives substantial financial support
from industry and other funds and has
therefore an obligation to consult with
farmer organisations on any moves in-
volving the destination of its research
products. When, in this instance, the
proposal from Fielders w 7 as first mooted,
the General Executive of the Farmers’
Union of W.A. was informed of the
position. Subsequently the Trustees of
the Soil Fertility Fund of W.A. and
of the Grain Pool of W.A., both
generous contributors to the Institute’s
research funds, were given an oppor-
tunity to comment on the agreement
long before any finality over conditions
was reached. These actions hardly
suggest anything “off-key” and gave
no indication that the bulk of W.A.
farmers would be “irate.” It would
appear that the only “irate farmers and
agriculturists” who consider the
scheme “heavily loaded in favor of
Fielders” are those not sufficiently
acquainted with the actual facts.
The statement that “many of the best
clovers are being sold at less than 20
cents per lb.” applies only to established
varieties in ample supply. Normally,
in the early years of production of a
new variety, the price to farmers has
usually been much higher, in fact some-
times 5-10 times higher than 20 cents,
except in cases such as Geraldton and
Cyprus barrel medic seed when the In-
stitute exercised initial price control.
The agreement with Fielders, with its
ceiling of 30 cents per lb. for Uniwager
for three years, specifically prevents any
such early exploitation of farmers.
Mention is also made in the article
of negotiations between Fielders and the
Esperance Land and Development Coy.
It should be made clear that these form
no part of the agreement with the Uni-
versity and were made independently
of the agreement with the University.
Therefore the University has no respon-
sibility in this respect.
Finally, I would like to make a plea
for a more enlightened and progressive
attitude to the entry of reputable private
companies such as Fielders into the field
of pasture plant breeding, selection, and
development. In many advanced coun-
tries, and more particularly in the
U.S.A. and western Europe, private
firms play an important, indeed vital,
role in applied agricultural research and
development. Two of the greatest agri-
cultural success stories of modern times
- the hybrid corn and the broiler in-
dustries are overwhelmingly the re-
sult of the enterprise, initiative, and ex-
pertise of private companies, with im-
mense benefits to thousands of farmers
and millions of consumers. I see no
reason why the agreement with Fielders
should not also result in considerable
short-term and long-term benefits to the
farmers and the public of Western Aus-
tralia and elsewhere in this country.

Writers' Retreat
Far from being a period of frater-
nisation with the great, or a “type-
writer picnic,” the writers’ retreat was
a time when much of real value was
accomplished. Works of all kinds were
conceived, planned, worked on, and
completed by the fifteen emergent
writers. The critics and helpers pro-
vided by the organisers appeared to
be impressed with their quality,
quantity, and diversity.
Further, that which began as an
artifice quickly developed into a unique
community of literary friends, con-
structive critics, and possible market-
ing contacts. Often the inherent and
undesirable isolation of the creative
writer was destroyed and replaced by
healthy intellectual and social inter-
course.
Perhaps an even more important
facet of the Retreat manifested itself
only at the end of the month: fifteen
young writers left Armidale secure in
the knowledge that there is an Aus-
tralian Literature and dedicated to its
furtherance. Bravo, Retreat!

Ned Kelly
Many years ago I had the oppor-
tunity of talking with a few of the re-
maining “besieged,” and “besiegers” of
the Glenrowan affair. I can clearly re-
call there being no doubt in the minds
of the “besieged” that Ned’s movements
outside the hotel were in the aspect of
“every man for himself.” He displayed
no attributes of leadership in the face of
a portending “battle.” The police and
others among the “besiegers” held the
view that Ned may have easily led his
forces to safety had he displayed
courage and initiative before the police
line became effective.
Ned’s only previous “battle” experi-
ence had been at Stringy Bark Creek,
and the advantage was his, in so far
that the “operation” was an ambush.
I cannot find anything in evidence
favoring the memory of Ned Kelly,
but there is much to commend the
schoolteacher, Curnow, who saved the
train and possible slaughter of many of
the incapacitated victims. Also, Ser-
geant Michael Kennedy, who had no
illusions of what to expect from the
Kellys when he went, in the course of
duty, to the Wombat Ranges.
Curnow was gallant, and set an
example of responsible citizenship, and
Kennedy contributed in no small
measure to the traditions of the Victoria
Police Force. I prefer to remember these
two men rather than Ned Kelly, for
whom there appears not a shred of evi-
dence to support his alleged “gameness”
which was applied only many years
after his execution and memories were
dimmed.

Catholic Bishops
The calling of a bishop has never
been easy, and this vocation has its
special difficulties, in this day and age,
when any authority is held up to close
scrutiny. Those who are so anxious to
participate in that choice might do well
to reflect that they must share the re-
sponsibility of that choice.
I do think Mr. Grant (B. Feb. 25)
was rather overstating the difficulties
which will confront a successor to the
Melbourne See, but I nevertheless
recognise that the See of Melbourne
does present, perhaps, a unique problem
from the point of view of succession,
for the Catholic Church in Australia.
The choice of an International Bishop
for Canberra or Melbourne could be
a practical step in helping to build the
modern International Community, and
in the light of that possibility, Mr.
Grant’s otherwise curious suggestion
does not sound so strange.

view of “Arcady and Other Places”
(8., Jan. 7) traced Buckley’s “accep-
tance of the status quo” to “the absence
of social vices here that he sees in al-
ternative societies.”
Any understanding of the “Eleven
Political Poems,” to which I adverted
exclusively and which Mr. Hall did not
exempt from his generalisation, requires
seeing what is exemplified in “Revo-
lutionary Situation,” reference to which
was cut away from my original and
probably overlong letter (8., Feb. 18):
“the corpses strung up for our wrongs”
(political and social) here and now,
as well as when “the mass trials begin”;
and that the poet accepts neither situa-
tion, whether politically or socially, ex-
plicitly or implicitly.

Appreciation
Glory to Ross Campbell for his re-
flections on names (8., March 18).
Adelaide still has its Cleland Teesdale
Smith Pavey and Harris and strangers
may wonder how many Christian names
this includes. Melbourne’s Mallison
Stewart & Co., however, are now plain
Mallisons.
But how many printers blessed the
day that “The Queensland Permanent
Trustee, # Executor, and Finance
Agency Company” became “Queens-
land Trustees, Limited” don’t forget
the comma!

How to store your wines
and share a 'crust’ with friends
Perhaps one of the most interesting
facts about wine is this: it is the only
beverage which can continue to im-
prove with age after it has been
bottled. But, of course, one doesn’t
just carelessly cast a few bottles in a
corner, in the hope that in ‘x’ num-
ber of days, months or years, the wine
will have developed into a veritable
Chateauneuf-du-Pape.
Wine is a living thing, and it res-
ponds to careful husbandry. The
better care you give it, the more it will
return you. So, why not make yourself
a cellar. It need not take the carved
stone and aged oak beam style
favoured in movies, but can be con-
tained in any suitable cupboard any-
where in the house.
What do you look for? The main
considerations are temperature, (the
ideal temperature range is 50° to
60°F.) dryness and protection from
direct sunlight. Sunlight affects wine
adversely, turning white wines yellow
and robbing all wines of their finer
flavour. A closet then is admirable.
You may also consider the top
shelves of a wardrobe, shelves in a
garage, or under stairs.
Once you've selected your site, the
next point to consider is that all
corked wines most specially the
table wines, should be stored lying on
their sides. This is not just tradition,
it’s vital. You see, if the cork is not
kept moist, it can shrink. Too much
air enters the bottle and the wine
becomes ‘pique’ or vinegary. And it
is a good idea, when stacking your
bottles in their racks, to place the
cork facing the outside, so you can
watch for leakage.
How long should you age your
wine? White wines are best drunk the
year you buy them, but they can be
kept in a cellar for a few years before
they start to decline. Much the same
can be said for the less expensive
‘everyday’ red wines. However, red
wines are the basis of any really good
cellar. Dalwood Hermitage and Dal-
wood Burgundy for example make
excellent cellar starters. And as you
browse around wine merchants or
bottle departments, you will un-
doubtedly pick up ‘special bin’ wines
such as Penfolds Coonawarra Claret
Bin 128, Penfolds Shiraz Mataro Bin 2
or Penfolds SA/HR Dry Red Bin 333,
which you can lovingly lay aside for
years to await their day of sacrifice.
Sparkling wines seldom stay in a
cellar long enough to age. Let's face
it, could you walk past your cellar
every day if you knew there was a
bottle of Minchinbury awaiting you
there? However, if you have sufficient
stamina, they do give reward for
storing.
Sherries and Ports the fortified
or ‘brandied’ wines can stand up-
right without harm, but we still
recommend that you lie them on their
sides if you intend to store them for
long periods. The higher alcoholic
content 'preserves’ the wine even
after opening. But be sure, either one,
tenderly set aside for the future, will
reward your time investment by taking
on an even smoother, more mellow
character.
Now a few quick words of wisdom
that you as a 'cellarmaster' probably
already know but which will bear
repeating. Red wines increase their
fragrance and flavour if you open
them half an hour before serving
this is the ‘breathing’ period. ‘Crust’
is the sediment a red wine collects
during ageing. Quite harmless, and
will settle to the bottom of the bottle
in about 30minutes. Purists prefer not
to dull the clarity of their wine, and
carefully pour so as not to disturb it.
Some even decant the wine into a
special wine server. But should some
crust get into your guest’s glass,
you may wish to point out it’s al-
most a ‘guarantee’ that the wine has
properly aged!
Collecting wines is a fascinating
and rewarding hobby. (You can start
with a bottle of Dalwood and a list of
Penfolds Special Bins.) Choose your
wines carefully. Guard their rest
watchfully. Pour them lovingly! Pen-
folds wines, particularly, reward the
drinker for all attention given.
Obtain a list of Penfolds Special
Wines now available and start your
cellar.
