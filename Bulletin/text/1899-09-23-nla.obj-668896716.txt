UDER THE GUMTREE
A Warm Woman.
DOWN at Man-o’-War
Steps the other day a
boat load of clean, trim,
lusty tars had just
landed from one of the British
squadron in Farm Cove, and a
sailor’s lass was walking off
with her man. Each had an
arm round the other’s neck,
and a passing pattern of female
precision paused a moment to
lift a disgusted chin and throw a
withering glance at the amorous
couple. The girl caught it and
swung round—one arm on her
hip, the other still about her
lover’s neck. “Don’t you wish
you had him yourself ? ” she said.
That is a coarse parallel
for the amusing feminine feud
between Gertrude Atherton and Alice Mey-
nell ; but it states the trade jealousy, the
{physical rivalry underlying the feud. Mrs.
Meynell is an English writer of poems and essays
—poems with some value of style and emotion,
essays pruned and polished with a precious
art that kills the life of them. Mrs. Ather-
ton is an American writer of novels about
the elemental woman striving upward the
woman who wants a man with a big arm, a big
heart, and a big brain to match her instincts and
aspirations. She has no style at all, but she pulses
with life and her revelations are capital reading.
And she assails herad versary vi et armis, tongue and
claws—an adversary too dignified to retort, calm
in superiority, yet possibly—one wonders - qualify-
ing her pride with qualms? Is hers the fuller
life, the superior function ?
Gertrude Atherton lives, anyway : she rejoices
in her emotions; denies the ascetic virtues;
admits her physical basis, even glories in it. No
colourless sublimities of art or conduct for her, if
—as can hardly be doubted —her heroines sincerely
represent her. And all a man’s sympathies go
with her. Mrs. Meynell’s literary sculpture
may outlast Mrs. Atherton’s crude literary
paintings; Mrs. Meynell’s repose is more im-
pressive than Mrs. Atherton’s fury of action;
but at any rate this is thrilling and moving, this is
a woman alive. In refusing to segregate her im-
pulses—such fqr myself, such for my family, such
for my books —she betrays her sex’s conventions,
is distinctly ! * unladylike” and femininely un-
literary ; —but she is infinitely more interesting.
Even if, according to the word attributed to one
of her rivals, her avowals make her a common
woman of literature—she is patently a Woman.
And, after all, can a woman be more or better ?
It is settled, of course, that no woman, no
feminine woman, can be a writer of fiction on the
high plane: the apparent exceptions—“ George
Eliot,” “George Sand,’’ Charlotte Bronte and
others—had the physical essence and inind of a
man. Though fiction has not the breadth of history
or the depth of philosophy, at its best it demands
something of both qualities, and the mind of a
typical woman is neither very broad nor very
deep, so she must content herself with being
recorder and suggester rather than creator.
Poetry is another matter. As philosophy, at one
end of the mental gamut, calls chiefly for intellect,
poetry, at the other end, calls chiefly for emotion.
Its essence is passionate emotion, and woman is
characteristically the vessel of passionate emotion.
An overplus of intellect spoils poetry as it spoils a
woman. S > it is that, across the ages, we still
thrill to the passion of Sappho—and the crowd of
novels by modern women are the merest ephe-
merae.
Gertrude Atherton is too much of a woman to
escape from the disabilities of her sex, and her
clever stories are of only momentary interest.
But, their limitations granted, it is possible to
praise highly the results of her talent. She has her-
self the conjunction attributed to her heroines—
elemental passion and a shrewd modern brain; and
her books are among the best being written by
women to-day. “ Patience Sparhawk and Her
Times ” is chief of them, and in it Mrs. Atherton
has probably reached her climax. “ Los Cerritos ”
and “American Wives and English Husbands”
are similar in kind, but not as forceful; and
the shortness of “ His Eortunate Grace ” puts
it out of the comparison. A short story may
yield as intense an impression as a long one of
equal merit; but it cannot give the same weight
of impression. The pebble from David’s sling
slew Goliath as effectually as an avalanche
could have slain him, and maybe more artistic-
ally ; but Goliath, in his last moment of conscious-
ness, would have been much more impressed by
the avalanche.
Mrs. Atherton has been a prolific writer: her
husband is dead : one does not hear of children—
maybe her books take the place of them. She is
a great-grand-niece of old Ben Franklin, and
proud of it. It is not necessary, in order to keep
an impression of her, to have read “ Hermia
Suydam” or “The Doomswoman, ” or other of
her early novels—any more than it is necessary to
plod through her dozen or more books to get an
impression of the local “Ada Cambridge”: she
is all of a piece, she cannot say more or do better
than she says and does in “Patience Sparhawk.”
There is the interest of a new plot, the interest of
pursuing the old ideas through new phases and
expressions, to make “ The Californians ” and
“A Daughter of the Vine ” worth looking at; but
they add nothing essential to the author’s statement
of herself. You can score them for development,
but not for character —the settled character of a
woman who wants emotions, all the emotions of
which she is capable, emotions of sex, sense,
spirit, every attribute of her organism—admitting
and using hereditary accumulations while striving
for the utmost satisfaction of her individual
capacities and potencies. Here’s a full-freighted
galley— vogue lagalerc!
Mrs. Atherton is a fine woman: with a little
,‘nore knowledge and restraint she would be a fine
writer. Gifted with wit, full of fancy and
occasionally flashing phrases, but lacking humour,
and with proper feminine love of extravagance,
craving the too-much, she founders in the quick-
sands of melodrama, frequently splits on the rock
of anti-climax. Her novels have epic force
without the epic form and the olinohing
epio inevitability. _ Patience Sparhawk’s de-
liverance in the nick of time is as jarring
as the theatrical hero’s death in the preoise contr©
of the stage, in the precise centre of the circle of
limelight. The unnecessary people in “Los Cer-
ritos ” are wiped out by a stampede of cattle with
the generous suddenness of a god descending from
a machine. Perhaps “The Californians,” con-
sidered as an episodical novel of character, is
best constructed of Mrs. Atherton’s books ; and
the tragedy of Don Roberto’s end is really tragic.
But his suicide per the American flag is on the
border-line of melodrama : a note of exclamation
would have thrown it over.
To what profit cavils : let us take the good the
goddesses provide.

Bookfellow’s Competitions.
VII.-WANTED—A TRIOLET.
Closed Sept. 9. Several hundred triolets and
other things were received—and not one good.
The triolet only looks' easy. A selection of toler-
able attempts is printed herewith ; and some more
will be given latex-. Many competitors disqualified
themselves by omitting the Australian reference ;
and very few interwove the last lines so as to get
sornething better than repetition. D. O’R.’s
“ Flannel Flower ” might have taken the prize had
it been a triolet: it isn’t. F.M.’s “Modernity and
a Maid ” would have been very seriously con-
sidered if it had local colouring; it hasn’t. So
competition was gradually lessened to “Nil’s”
“Greeting”—which is technically the better ;and
Phil. F.’s “ Bushman ’’—which has more force and
interest; and as force and interest were put first
“ The Bushman ” bears the bell.

IX.—WANTED -A SPEECH.
Sydney undertakers picnicked the other day ;
and the speeches, sad to say! were all sermons.
Now, an undertaker is obviously a jovial soul, and
if he had imagination lie would make a jovial
speech. The Bookfcllow wants that speech. You
are the chief undertaker at the picnic; you are
naturally bright and humorous; you are jolly
with good living, light hearse-exercise, and the
cheerful atmosphere of tombs ; and the eyes of
all the other undertakers and the mutes are
fixed upon you ;—you call upon them to
charge their glasses, and you fill your
own; they boat upon the table encouragingly
and the caterer’s dog is hished away ; —then you
rise in a hush of joyful expectation broken by a
ripple of anticipatory laughter, and propose
Success to Undertaking !
What do you say ? in not more than 500 words,
packed with wit and sepulchral wisdom—by
Oct. 14.
The best speech earns 10s. fid., plus space rates.
“The Popular Omar!” “Ignotus” is quite
right about Fitzgerald’s alleged translation.
Writing, at I do, with a competent knowledge of
the language and literature of Persia, 1 can say
that the hook has more Fitzgerald than “ Ann-
JE&aiam” in it. (My spelling of the name is the
correct one, according to Hunter’s and Fortv-s’s
system.) An Ismaili mystic of the name lived,
and wrote verses. Every educated Persian writes
verses. The language lends itself more readily
than any other on earth to expression in
metre. It would be easy in Isfahan to
find a couple of hundred Mirzas who would write
quatrains better than the originals of those in
Fitzgerald’s book at sixpence a-piece ; and I will
teach you the trick when you know the language
well enough. Such men are to be found, too, in
Afghanistan—especially in Herat and Kabul,
where most of the population speak Per-
sian—and in many Indian cities. No trans-
lation can really convey the true sense of
the original. It is simply the translator’s inter-
pretation, and its value depends on his capacity
for interpreting another man's utterances. Fitz-
gerald makes his author talk like a European
instead of like the Muslim sectary he was. There
is not a particle of real local colour in the verses.
If there were, they would not be so popular with
British and Australian Philistines who like
Kipling’s “Barrack-room Ballads.”

WHAT THE DOCTORS SAY
«Woolloston House, Castlemaine, Nov. 30, 1897. My
dear Mr. Malyon,—l have used your ointment Ligmolliene
with distinct success in my own case, but with greater as
an emollient unguent for the face of a young lady suffer-
ing from ‘ Acne,’ very common during puberty, and you
should push it in that direction. Mr. Best, solicitor,
speaks most highly of it in his own bad case of Eczema.
Kindly send me another box of it..—Yours truly, GEO. D.

What the Hon. W. H. EMBLING, M.D., M.L.C., says :
“Melbourne, May 27, 1899. Mr. W. H. Malyon.—Dear
Sir,—l have been using your Ligmolliene Ointment for
some time for a lady friend of mine suffering from Chronic
Eczema, and have found it gives her great relief. She
says it is the best remedy she ever tried for that com-
plaint.—Yours faithfully, W. H. EMBLING, M.D.”

My dear Mr. Malyon, — August 21st, 1898.
With great pleasure I now sit down to record progress
with regard to my old enemy, “ Eczema Capitis,” from
which I suffered, notwithstanding constant treatment for
some years under the prescription of Professor M‘Call
Anderson and other eminent-dermatologists, with only
partial and temporary relief. When I met you I com-
menced somewhat sceptically your ointment Ligmolliene,
and after about two months’ treatment I may honestly say
my enemy is defeated, and I am perfectly well. I will only
add that since I commenced the treatment of myself I have
prescribed it to others, and am still doing so with brilliant
results. Please accept my hearty thanks, and remain yours
sincerely, THOS. LE GAY HOLTHOUSE, M.R:C.R, L.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Australia.
A lone old maid, amid the solitude
Of dreaming seas you were condemned to wait
Through oountless ages for the gracious mood
Of scornful and inexorable Fate.
Yearning in vain you grew to womanhood,
While barren years passed by, tans love, sans
hate.
In north and east and west the brides were wooed:
To you the white man’s love came late —so late !
Your cheeks are hollow, and your eyes are dim
With pale-blue emptiness of dead despair;
Long summers dried your suppleness of limb ;
Your face is sad, your voice is mute, your hair
Is bleached with age, and life is dull and grim—
Poor faded maid, whose springtime none would
share 1
Q.
VON KOTZE.
Man and Woman.
[According to Maori mythology, the god Tiki created
Man by taking a piece ot clay and moistening it with his
own blood. Woman was the offspring of a sunbeam and
a sylvan echo.]
Thus God made Man to cope with destiny :
Taking the common clay, God moistened it
With His red blood ; and so for ever lit
That sombre grossness with divinity.
So man for ever finds him in the mesh
Of clogging earth ; and though divine hopes thrill
And flush his leaping heart, it faints, for still
His dreams are pinioned in the gyves of flesh.
Yet ever God’s blood in him courses free,
And, penetrated with eternal hope,
Up Evolution’s long, uneven slope
Man lifts him from his sodden ancestry.
And though his eyes the far goal cannot see,
And half the terrors of the dark he knows,
Yet with an inward fire his courage glows;
He bears the torch of immortality.
But Woman from a memory had birth,
Into the forest’s dignity of shade
A sudden sunbeam groped—a soft hand laid
In silent benediction on the earth.
Then filtered through the green a song forlorn
Of some forgotten bird. Lo ! in a mist
Of love the sunbeam and the echo kissed,
And Woman —sunlit memory—was born !
So light and melody to her belong—
The sunlight in the dying echo blurred !
So woman came—a vision and a word
From the Unknown —a sunbeam and a song i
So ever through the forest of the years
Shall Man pursue and still pursue the gleam
That wavers and is gone; and through his dream
The fainting echo of a song he hears.
And when at last his weary feet are led
Into the sacred glade, and she stands there,
He takes her close —all song and sunlit hair ;
The gleam has faded and the song has fled !
And though with blinded eyes he cannot see,
She haunts him like a word that he knows not-
That is not quite remembered, nor forgot—
Some thought that hovers near a memory.
As out from Heaven she leans, on earth there falls
The sunbeam of her hair, golden and fine ;
And drops an echo of a voice divine —
A voice that ever vainly calls and calls !
And though she spill a splendour and a fire
Upon the dark, her glory is unknown ;
Behind the screen of sex she dwells alone ;
She cannot come as close as her desire.
So ever like a pale moon drowned in misto
Her face is vague—a barrier intervenes ;
And ever from her loneliness she leans,
With waiting eyes, all-wistful to be kissed !
N.S.W.
ARTHUR H. ADAMS.
To Nance at Noon.
Old Pan and all the nymphs are here,
For this is Passion’s flowery way ;
Step easily, and do not fear —
No stupid scruple suits the day.
You must not mind what “people say ” :
People are fools, and youth is fleet ;
Live while you live, though friends gainsay
Love leads us by the hand, my Sweet !
Love is the one thing stable, dear,
While earth grows old and creeds decay;
You’re Cupid’s mistress, Psyche’s peer ;
No stupid scruple suits the day.
Let’s live and love, while live we may,
While violets spring about our feet,
What time, in exquisite array,
Love leads us by the hand, my Sweet 1
Now, ere the roses disappear
And grim Death takes our joys away,
While Paphian music soothes the ear,
No stupid scruple suits the day.
The night draws on. No longer stay
Bemused by ethics of the street.
Come! join the Graces at their play—
Love leads us by the hand, my Sweet!
Nance! Yield your lips. No more delay ;
Nj stupid scruple suits the day.
Soft voices call from Venus’ seat . . . \j
Love leads us by the hand, my Sweet!

“ If I were asked which single medicine I should

without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms

the chairman. The latter read from it an en-
couraging announcement re the Clutha prohibi-

asked to see it. It was reluctantly passed to him,
and after a long struggle with the half-obliterated
date, he found it to be only four years old 1

WHAT IS CATARRH ?
/CATARRH is inflammation of the
lining membrane of the nose
and adjoining passages. If this in-
flammation is not arrested it invades
the passages which lead from the
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lungs. It injures the sight and
hearing, destroys the sense of taste
and smell, renders the breath offen-
sive, breaks down the affected
tissues, consumes the nasal car-
tileges, and rots away the small
frontal bones of the skull. The putrid
discharge passing through the lungs
and stomaoh causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want relief and
cure ? If so, try our great remedy. It
has no equal.

A well-known Australian bishop, \vho
grieves that he never experienced tile blessings of
paternity, recently related his woes to the leading
local medical mam A day or two later the medico
wan uallod i In to Bee the prelate (confined to bed
by bronchial trouble), and, as he entered the room,
burst into laughter that astonished the bishop and
his anxious spouse. The spluttering doctor would
give no answer to enquiries until the old lady had
left the room. Then he pointed to a Bible- text
card hanging on the wall: “ Suffer little ohildren
to come unto Me.”
Premier Turner has been telling a some-
what obscure interviewer about how he was
dragged forward at every stage of his public
career. So far as the measure of his greatness ex-
tends, he embodies the paradox of having achieved
it, and yet of having it thrust upon hnn. This
means that he was more than equal to every posi-
tion into which circumstances forced him. A ears
ago he was simply a hard-working attorney, with
Sam Lyons as his senior partner, and had no
thought of public life in any form. His St. Kilda
residence was about half-way between two railway
stations. It was his custom to take the train at
a certain one of these, but one morning Fate im-
pelled him to take the other. Three of his ac-
quaintances, in comparatively humble life, were
ohatting there, and one said, “ Here’s our man for
Town Councillor.” A vacancy had just occurred.
Turner protested that business forbade,
but was persuaded, and got elected. Two
years later he was Mayor. Then came a new
division of the Parliamentary electorates, cutting
St. Hilda off Prahran. Turner’s friends insisted
that this was built for him, displacing nobody. So
he was elected. The next step was Premier
Munro nominating him for Commissioner of Cus-
toms. Turner jibbed again, pointing out the
superior claims of Peacock and Stuart, who were
in the Cabinet without portfolios. Munro made
him take it. Then Munro went to London as
Agent-General, leaving Shiels at the head of the
Cabinet. Patterson bowled it over. As the weak-
ness of the Patterson team became evident, and
Shiels was sick, adeputation turned up at Lyons and
Turner’s office with a demand for Turner to lead
the Opposition. Turner would have refused but
for the accident of Lyons beingin the office (Lyons
did all the outside work). His hostility to Tur-
ner’s political dabbling seemed implacable, but
when Turner laid his last offer before him, Sam
said : “Take it. It’s the chance of a lifetime.
If you become Premier you’ll be out in three
months.”

e’s Bronchitis
THE FAMOUS REMEDY FOR
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, AND CONSUMPTION,
HAS THE LARGEST SALE OF ANY CHEST MEDICINE IN AUSTRALIA
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or
Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a Complete Cure. It is most com-
forting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has
never been known to exist where “ Coughs " have been properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a Complete Cure is certain.
B€WAR€ OF COU6NS!
REMEMBER THAT EVERY DISEASE HAS ITS COMMENCEMENT, AND CONSUMPTION IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE.
CONSUMPTION.
TOO ILL TO LEAVE HIS BED.
A COMPLETE CURE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. —Dear Sir,—l am writing to tell you
about the wonderful cure your medicine has effected in
my case. About three years ago I began to cough. At
first the cough was not severe, but it gradually got worse,
and I became very weak and troubled with night sweats,
pain in my chest, and great quantities of phlegm. On
several occasions there was blood in the expectorated
matter. I had been treated by a doctor, who pronounced
my case to be Consumption, and various other treatments
had been tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage
that I heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for
a course of the medicine. When it arrived I was too ill to
leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at once, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two lots
of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure, for
which accept my very best thanks.—Yours gratefully,
J. BLAIR.

it. It is a really wonderful medicine ; does good at once,
and “can’t be licked.”—Yours sincerely,

" Mr. W. G. Hearne, Geelong.—
“ Dear Sir, —
Your letter and Bronchitis Cure to hand quite safe.
I am sure you will be glad to know that your Bronchitis
Cure has quite cured me. I was very glad when it came,
as I was suffering from a severe attack of Bronchitis at the
time it arrived. I had sent for my own doctor, but had
not had one night’s rest for a week. 1 started taking the
Bronchitis Cure three times a day as directed, and was
very much eased at once. At the end of a week I only
took it twice a day, and then only every night for a
week, as I was so much better when, thanks to the Lord
for adding His blessing, 1 was quite well, and walked into
town and hack without feeling any fatigue. I had not
done that previously for 12 months—always went in the
omnibus—as walking caused me such pain and distr. ss in
the chest. I always walk now, and never feel it, and l
am stronger than I ha\e been for years. 1 thank my son
for his great kindness in sending the medicine, and am,
dear Sir,
“ Yours very truly,
“M. MORTIMER.”
Extract from a letter, since written by the mme lady to
her son, Mr. John S. Mortimer, Llenwellyn, Katunga,
Victoria.
HER DAUGHTER HAD BEEN VERT ILL.
SPITTING UP BLOOD.
THE DOCTOR SAID NOTHING MORE COULD BE
DONE.
CURED BY HE ARNE'S BRONCHITIS CUBE.
The extract runs as follows:—“As for myaelf, thank
the Lord, lam feeling stronger than I have for years. I
had an attack of Bronchitis In November, but Hearne’e
Bronchitis Cure was again successful. 1 feel quite well,
and walk into town feeling quite strong.
“I must ask you to send me six bottles more of the
medicine, as I wish to have a supply in the house. I
have tried to get it made up here, and let my chemist
have a bottle to see what he could do. He tells me this
week he can make nothing out of it, he never saw any-
thing like it before, so there is only one thing for me to
do—send for more. 1 have never kept in bed one day
since I commenced to take it. 1 used to be in bed a fort-
night at a time always, and after that for months I was
as weak as I could possibly be, and was always taking
cod liver oil, so you will see at once it is quite worth
while sending for it such a long distance.
“ Something more 1 must tell you. Charlotte has been
very ill since 1 wrote you. Her cough was so bad she
never had a night’s rest, and was spilling up blood
very much. The doctor told her husband that there was
nothing more he could do for her. So on the Sunday I
sent her half a bottle of the Bronchitis Cure, and told
her to try it, and if she did not use it, not to waste it,
but send it back again. She had such confidence in her
doctor that 1 thought she would not try it. On the
Wednesday I sent over again, and she was much better,
the night’s rest was very good, and cough and bleeding
from the lungs better. She sent for another half-bottle,
and on the following Sunday sent over to say that she
was quite cured and did not require any more medicine.
So you see what great good it has done, and she wishes
to have some of my next supply.”

DISTRESSING, SUFFOCATING, DRY COUGH

NO OTHER TREATMENT COULD EVEN EASE IT.
“Sir.—My wife was for twelve years a sufferer from
a most distressing, suffocating, dry cough that could not
be removed or even eased by any remedy, doctors’
prescriptions and patent medicines having been tried ;
but I am happy to say that the cough, pain in Lite chest,
and difficulty of breathing, etc., were entirely removed by
the fifth dose of your Bronchitis Cure.—i remain, Sir,

for five years, and now I do not feel safe to be without it.

A Seven Years’ Case.
EXPECTORATING BLOOD AND MATTER.
COMPLETELY CURED.
“ Mr. W. G. LTearne.
“ Dear Sir,—Your medicine has cured me of bronchitis
and asthma, from which I suffered for upwards of seven
years, during which period 1 was scarcely ever free from
coughs, ami frequently the difficulty of breathing was so
distressing that for nights in succession I had to sit up.
1 write you this acknowledgment from a sense of duty, as
in my case every other treatment had failed. For a year
previous I had been getting very much worse, and at the
time 1 obtained your medicine I was confined to bed
Buffering from a most violent cough, expectorating blood
and matter, and apparently heyond hope of recovery.
The first dose of the medicine gave me welcome relief,
and I steadily improved as I continued the treatment,
until 1 became, as 1 am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely,

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1899.
Concerning William John Lyne.
Last week Providence, or the agent who
was temporarily keeping the cigar alight till
Providence came back, made William John
Lyne Premier of New South Wales. And
since then New South Wales has been
thoughtfully summing-up the situation, and
it recognises many things. The new Pre-
mier’s front names of William John are
against him. He is a dry, elderly politician,
who has waited long and patiently, and
“ bullocked” long and wearily, before coming
into his kingdom—and that is, perhaps,
against him also. He is supposed to be a
routine person of the old school—though that
is not known with absolute certainty ; lie
may have been merely lying low and hiding
his talent under a pint-pot pending the
arrival of his opportunity. He has never
written bad poetry like Parkes, or execrable
poetry like Reid ; nor has he been known,
so far as the w r riter is aware, to make a single
dazzlingly brilliant observation in all his
life. He has mostly stuck to his principles,
and plodded honourably in the straight track
whether it was the right one or the wrong
one—-so far as The Bulletin remembers it
was often the wrong one. No erratic or
flashy “ Yes-no ” or “ No-yes” has disfigured
his career. He has indulged in no joyful
public calisthenics. He has never really sat
on a rail, though The Bulletin once sus-
pected him of an intention that way, and
accused him of it in a cartoon. For one
thing, no ordinary rail would support him ;
for another, he is a plain, dry man, who has
few artistic tastes, and doesn’t care for the
scenery which is visible from a top rail ;
and, as a third possible reason, his
feet might get hitched in between the rails
coming down. Legend has it that William
John was once a policeman. He never was,
but if he had been The Bulletin is dead
certain he would have been a model police-
man, ever ready to tackle any-sized criminal,
alone or in company, with a plain, wooden
conscientiousness that took no account of
odds. Also, it is sure that his evidence
next morning would have been brief and to
the point. It is a hard thing to say, but if
Lyne were 30 years younger, he would make
an ideal policeman.
* * • *
Just now, however, there is a woeful
dearth of political talent in N.S.W. Every
province passes through these barren stages.
Queensland has been in one ever since
Lilley quitted politics. Maoriland in the
Atkinson and Whitaker days, and Victoria
in the period of Gillies, Munro and Pat-
terson, and S.A. in the Downer and
Colton and jaunty Johnny Bray era, strug-
gled through just the same kind of wilder-
ness. So circumstances have thrown Wil-
liam John Lyne to the surface. And,
despite the patient dreariness of the man,
there is no absolutely certain evidence that
circumstances have not done N.S.W. a good
turn. Lyne has never yet had a great
opportunity ; it remains to be seen whether
he has any use for an opportunity when
it comes. As a subordinate member
of the Dibbs and Jennings Ministries
he had no chance to reveal great con-
structive abilities, if he had them. As
Opposition leader his only show was to be
a brilliant critic, and Lyne’s elocution is like
unto the light and airy fancies of three tons
of bricks. His want of eloquence, however,
has nothing to do with the case. A man
may be a brilliant debater and a giddy mob
orator, like George Reid, -and have no
political honesty, no fixity of purpose, and
no constructive ability ; also, he may label
himself “Democrat” with a huge label sus-
pended on his lower waistcoat, again like
George Reid, and be full of alleged good
intentions, and do practically nothing. If
Lyne will accomplish, in a dull, practical
way, some long-waited-for reforms, instead
of talking about them with bright and airy
persiflage, then he may label himself “Tory,”
or “Reactionary,” or anything he likes.
N.S.W. has had enough gorgeous label
during the last five years to last it for a
century. Five years ago, after Victoria had
decided that the eloquent Shiels, with his
big democratic inscription, was no good, that
province, in a moment of desperation, tried
a painfully-serious, totally un-eloquent,
commonplace-looking little man with ill-
fitting brown clothes, who had never in his
life raised a laugh in a mob meeting or pro-
mised to make anybody Jolly and Fat. And
he has done more for the people, in his
hard, unsympathetic way, than the loudest
alleged Democrat of the crowd. There is no
reason why Lyne should not be the same
kind of a surprise if he wants to.
• * * *
For a Premier of energy, courage and
patient industry (Lyne has all three), of
constructive ability (Lyne may have that
hidden about him, or he may borrow it from
a better-equipped colleague), and of genuine
democratic instincts (Lyne may have been
concealing these so far, and if so his success
in the concealment has been marvellous
beyond description) New South Wales offers
a brilliant field. That province wants so
many things that a Premier needs no great
originality to build up a good programme.
It also wants so many things that one or
other of the adjacent provinces have got that
he doesn’t even need much constructive
ability; a capacity for judiciously selecting
the best features of the legislation of other
States would keep a reasonably adaptable
man going for a dozen years. N.S.W. needs
a thoroughly good Navigation law ; an
Early-Closing Act—which ean be borrowed
to a great extent from Maoriland ; a Local
Governmenc Act, which can be cadged bodily
•from Victoria, that province having about
the most complete Local Government system
in Australasia ; and an Old Age Pension law
after the Maoriland pattern. It wants its
land and income taxes graduated in or about
the Maoriland or South Australian fashion,
according to the size of the income or pro-
perty, with the S.A. absentee tax on top of
all. Its Shops and Factories Act requires to
be improved and extended all over the pro-
vince. It wants a minimum wage ; a State
Land Bank built on the comprehensive lines
of the Maoriland institution but with its
funds raised locally as in Victoria ; a com-
pulsory Conciliation and Arbitration law,
also after the Maoriland pattern ; a State
note issue ; a scheme of land resumption for
closer settlement which will be as nearly as
possible built on the Maoriland principle ; a
State Life Insurance Department; a reformed
Upper House, possibly after the pattern
of the Federal Senate; a law regulating
hours of labor, and it is difficult to say how
many things besides. A man who knows
what to borrow from the legislation of more
advanced countries, and how to borrow it,
and who will turn neither to the right hand
nor the left, and waste no time flying off the
handle however brilliantly, but” will shove
his measures through by sheer dead weight,
has a great chance to do something among
all these urgent necessities.
• " * * *
Above all things there is a large opportun-
ity for an able financier—something that
N.S.W. hasn’t had within the memory of
most-men now living. George Reid left
the deficit just about as large as he found it
—left it the great boss deficit of Australasia.
He used up all the possibilities that were in
the Cash Basis for passing the liabilities
along—his Cash Basis permitted him to
permanently carry forward about £700,000
of unpaid bills, but that stroke of
genius can only be done once. He
seized the Church and School Lands-fund.
He saved one half-year's payment to most of
the sinking-funds by altering the date of the
financial year. He struck the great idea of
charging the interest on the public debt for
the half-year from Ist January to 30th June
(the day the financial year closes) to next
financial year because it isn't absolutely paid
over to the public creditor till Ist July (the
first day of the new financial year), and thus
made his accounts look better on paper. All
these mean little juggles are now exhausted,
therefore Lyne has to face the hard reality
of things. Moreover, Reid cut down the
road-vote so low that his successor must find
more money or see the public highways go to
ruin. He charged a groat mass of ordinary
expenditure to loans, which his successor
can’t do unless he wishes to be the same
object of public scorn that Reid became—
and that also means finding more money.
The late Premier raised the loan expendi-
ture in his last year to £700,000 more
than it was in the last year of the Dibbs-
Lyne Ministry, and cutting down the loan
expenditure again means finding still more
money. And finally, Reid left behind him a
fearful and incredible set of estimates for
the year ending 30th June, 1900, in which
he set forth that if he got £50,000 more
taxation the deficit would be £126,000, and
if he didn’t get it the shortage would be
£176,000.
» * * *
If Lyne is going to cut down loan ex-
penditure to the comparatively reasonable
figure to which the old Dibbs-Lyne Ministry
reduced it, and to cease faking the accounts
by paying for repairs to old buildings and
hundreds of other items of current expendi-
ture out of loans, and to make the finances
balance, he obviously wants about £700,000
a year more revenue. And it is difficult to
see where it can all or nearly all be raised
except by customs revenue. Yet to resort
to new customs taxation now on any large
scale will probably be regarded as a raising
of the fiscal ghost which all parties are
pledged to leave undisturbed till the Federal
Government takes that branch of the busi-
ness over.
• • * •
Reid, the eloquent funny man, and word-
juggler, and figure-juggler, and dancing
dervish of finance, has therefore left a tre-
mendous contract for his successor. His last
estimates, in which he foreshadowed a
shortage of £126,000 for the coming year,
showed that he was close up to the end of
his resources. And the position of the man
who toils to clear up the wreckage which
Reid left will be aggravated by all the
annoyances and all the obstructions which
that comic clown can bring to bear upon
him. Altogether Lyne starts with about the
largest contract which was ever faced by any
N.S.W. Premier. And if, by any weird
chance, he proves to be a strong, silent indi-
vidual, with strength and constructive ability
and plain horse-sense behind his apparently
dull exterior, he has the best chance ever
offered to any N.S.W. Premier to be the
man for the occasion. Sometimes the man
is wasted for want of the occasion ; Lyne
has an occasion as large as a good-sized Alp
if he is only the man. The Bulletin is
getting ready a halo to fit William John if
he astonishes his province by being the big
resourceful statesman that a suffering country
so bitterly requires. And if he proves him-
self only a plantigrade individual with a
yearning to fool away the public money in
this time of great straits by sending a foolish
contingent to shoot at somebody in Africa,
The Bulletin’s smallest boy will use that
halo as a hoop to play with on his next
birthday.
More Contingent.
Over half Australia just now there is a moan-
ing of shoddy majors and drapery colonels
about the advisability of sending troops to the
Transvaal in case of war. Maoriland has got
disease. Queensland has got it badly.
N.S. \V. has got it a good deal. The chief
reason why Victoria is late in catching it is
that Turner is a business man of the most
prosaic type, and all the gauds and feathers
and flags in the world wouldn’t pay him for
having bis finances thrown out of gear. But
let it be noted that the people who want to go
on this loyal and heroic errand don’t propose,
so far as all appearances go, to lose anything
by it themselves. They will probably get
good pay, plenty of provisions, and a great
send-off, and be, for some little time before
their departure, gaudy idols in uniform, and
able to walk out with a different girl every day
of the week. They will have their photos, in
the papers, and have bouquets heaved
at ( them, and have pretty women send-
ing them their portraits. Then they will have
a ( pleasant sea-pienic. When they reach the
Cape they will be treated not quite as the
ordinary Tommy Atkins, who is meant to be
shot at so long as the country requires him, and
then accommodated in the workhouse in his
old age, but rather as a noble and touching
symbol of the solidity of the Empire, and of the
attachment of the colonies to the dear old
mother country. And a Symbol requires a
great deal better food and accommodation than
a plain lommy. They will be taken special
notice of with a view to “ fostering the loyalty
of the colonies,’ and be paraded and inspected
and publicly thanked. It any of them are
killed or maimed by Oom Paul’s burghers
there will, in the natural order of things, be
very handsome provision out of the public
funds for the cripples and for t he dependents of
those who were cut off in the midst of their
glory. And the survivors will come back
brown and glorious, after mother pleasant
trip, to be wildly cheered on arrival,
and be thanked and reviewed and inspected
in the presence of admiring thousands, and
have more flowers thrown at them, and have
more pretty girls looking lovingly into their
eyes, and get their photos, into the papers again,
and be interviewed, and banqueted, and have
oceans of free beer, and he cablegrammed
about, and they will draw their accumulated
pay, and he heroes generally.
* * * m
And it is ten to one that the British military
authorities, having an inward suspicion about
the steadiness of these holiday soldiers, will
put them pretty far back from that part of the
line where Kruger’s grim Afrikanders are
thickest, and all the glory will be secured with
very little damage. And as for the community
in general its business is to work a little
harder, and keep its nose to the grindstone a
little longer per diem, to pay the bill, and also
to wear out its throat cheering when the great
men come back, and to pay for the flowers that
are thrown at them, and shout for them, and
grovel to them, and be pleased when they take
away its best girl, and proud to lose its best
girl in so noble a cause.

This proposed patriotic uprising is to help
Great Britain in a war with the 80,000 Boers
of the little State by the Vaal. The population
of Great Britain and Ireland is over 40,000,000
■ say 500 to 1 odds against the Boers. Reckon-
ing Britain and British India together, and
taking no count of the rest of the empire, the
odds against the farmer of the little republic
are about 3000 to 1, without any Australian
interference. The whole Boer population in
the Iransvaal isn’t equal to one-fourth of the
population of Sydney ojc Melbourne. It is less
than the population of Brisbane. It wouldn’t
make a fourth-rate English town. The British
subjects in the adjoining Cape Colony alone
should be able to flatten out Kruger and
Joubert with one hand. The Boers are
vastly outnumbered by the foreigners in their
own country. And three large Australasian
provinces profess to believe that Britain, with
500 to 1 odds in its favor, needs their assist-
ance in this matter, and they propose to work
up a great reputation for valor over it. It seems
a pity that they don’t make arrangements for
hitting some one of their own size. On mere
numbers, Tasmania alone should be a match
for the Boers of the Transvaal twice over.
* * * *
And the reason of the trouble is that a cer-
tain mixed crowd of Americans, Germans, .
Jews, Englishmen, and others, who own the
gold mines of the Rand, have grievances. Their
industry is taxed to about one-fifth the extent
to which the gold industry is taxed in the
adjoining British territory of Rhodesia ; at
about the same rate as in Queensland and Tas-
mania ; and a good deal less than in Maoriland
and (under Bigjohn Forrest’s new laws) in
YVestralia. Also the naturalisation laws are
not liberal enough (that is to say they are just
about as liberal as in Great Britain or N.S. W.)
therefore the alien doesn’t get a fair show to
help at governing the country. The alien is
taxed without representation just as he is in
England and Australia and anywhere else ; and
in addition to everything else the laws are ad-
ministered in a mean and grudging spirit. The
Boer doesn’t show that large-minded and
generous trust in the alien that he ought to do
after the seizure of his country in 1877, and after
the invasion of it in 1895 by a British force in
time of profound peace, and with the admitted
consent and approval of the Premier of an
adjacent British province, supported by the
cheering verses of the British Poet Laureate,
and the wild encouragement of the United
Kingdom in general.
* * * *
Wherefore The Bui.letin rises in its place
to propose these three resolutions :
(1) That Maoriland, N.S.W., and Queensland, if they
must needs go to war, should hit somebody nearer
to their own size instead of wading in against a small
State that, has done them no harm and that is already
facing odds of over 600 to 1. It is low and cowardly and
degrading, when you see a complete stranger with about
two dozen men on top of him, to offer your services as
25th man. The fact that the stranger is a foreigner and
the 24 men are your own countrymen makes it no less
degrading.
(2) That if any section of the Australian people feels so
patriotically fervent that it must go and hit one of the
smallest States in the world, it should pay its own pass-
age, and buy its own gun, and do the whole thing at its
own expense. The individual who is so consumed with ,
patriotic ardour that he must be paid good wages for
letting his feelings loose is a fraud and a hypocrite and a .
mercenary.
(3) But if the ruling classes of Australia are so full of ;
sympathy and ardor that they must tax this, at present, .
poor and depressed country, in order to send assistance ■
gratis to one of the richest crowds of capitalists in the
world, it should at least be explained to the British
Government, that no title or “honor” of any kind must,
be conferred on any Australian politician over the.
wretched business. Because, otherwise, an impression:
may arise that the senders of the contingent are mere
coarse, murderous butchers, who don’t mind who is killed:
or who is burdened with needless extra taxation, so long
as they can wade through blood to a title of the kind
which is bestowed in England on the grocery mayor of ai
second-rate town.
And these three resolutions are hereby carried!
unanimously.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Grief of Certain Eminent Citizens.
An influential meeting was held in Sydney last
week at which Jawbone Neild and Rev. Carr-
Smith and others expressed their just indigna-
tion at the Dreyfus sentence and at Dreyfus’s
judges, and their admiration of Picquart and.
Zola who dared to espouse the cause of the-
oppressed. Also, a committee (George Pile,.
honorary secretary) was appointed to further
express the public detestation. This sort of
tiling sets The Bulletin thinking. The French
authorities, finding that Dreyfus had been,
sentenced on no real evidence, gave him a fresh:
hearing and reduced his sentence to ten years ;;
but when Suffield was sentenced on no real
evidence the N.S.W. authorities refused him
any new hearing at all, although at least one
Minister of Justice admitted almost in so-
many words that there were doubtful circum-
stances about the case. The French authori-
ties tried to prevent Dreyfus getting a re-
hearing because the “ case was closed.”
O’Connor, Reid, Gould and co. and the
N.S.W. Parliament and people did prevent


Suffield getting a re-hearing on the
same ground. Colonel Jouast’s bias against
Dreyfus wasn’t a whit more violent
or more obvious or more shameful than
the unspeakable Windeyer’s bias against Suf-
field, and against every other prisoner who
came before him with a woman for his accuser.
Dreyfus served five years on no evidence worthy
of the name ; Suffield served more than eight.
So The Bulletin appoints itself lion, secretary
of its own little movement to express its utter
contempt and detestation of such cheap heroes
and philanthropists as Pile and Neild ana
Carr-Smith, who are so deeply grieved about
the injustice done to the man 16,000 miles
away, and yet wouldn’t even take the trouble
to be aware of the equally gross injustice done
to the man at their own door. The cheapest,
meanest, shabbiest kind of benevolence is that
which execrates the wrong perpetrated in
Central Asia, or in Patagonia, or on the Congo,
while it won’t see the wrong in thead jacent street
—apparently because seeing the latter would
involve the worry of trying to put it right, and
the worry of trying to put it right might make
the benevolent person tired. The second
Dreyfus trial, bad and disgraceful as it is,
should make Nkild and Carr-Smith and hon.
secretary Pile crawl through a hedge and hide
behind it in shame for themselves and their
own country, instead of leading them to put on
patronising airs. France is, at all events,
civilised enough to have the legal machinery
for revoking an unjust sentence—and it did
revoke Dreyfus’s first sentence. In N.S.W.
there isn’t even the legal mechanism to revoke
the most brutally unjust sentence ever passed ;
if Dreyfus had been wrongly sentenced there
the only tiling that could be done would be to
offer him a pardon. And Neild and Carr-
Smith and hon. secretary Pile never lift up
there voices on that point—presumably because
they don’t care how far their country lags be-
hind. And while France has at least enough
healthy public sentiment to make the Dreyfus
conviction an open scandal, in N.S.W., with its
somnolent Piles and Neilds and Carr-Smiths,
their isn’t sufficient moral sense to make
the public really aware of the existence of an
equally gross outrage on justice in their own
midst. So The Bulletin thinks of calling a
public meeting of its own to express its horror
of the shoddy philanthropy that is so grieved
about the distant wrong that it can’t redress,
and is so callous to the one that it could have
redressed if it had tried —only it wouldn’t try.
And some day, if it hears a great row at night,
and looking out of the window finds Neild and
Carr-Smith and George Pile being grievously
wronged by somebody—well, it will perhaps do
just as they did. Which means that it will sit
down comfortably inside, and hold an indigna-
tion meeting about the injuries of Bulgaria,
and pass resolutions to the effect that thesuffer-
ings of somebody in Poland call for the strong
disapproval of all Christian communities.
The “Crown’s” Licensed Perjurer.
In Victoria the police and detective force has
become a disgrace and a permanent stench, and
the administration of justice, under the foster-
ing care of the Crown Law Office, has become
something a trifle worse. The general rules
now followed appear to be these two :
(1) A Crown witness is licensed to commit the most
glaring perjury with impunity, and however open and
visible is his lying, so long as he lies for the commendable
object of getting a conviction against somebody (inno-
cent or otherwise) his friend and supporter, the Crown
Law Office aforesaid, will not proceed against him.
(2) But the person who gives evidence against the
Crown, and for the prisoner, shall be prosecuted for per-
jury if there is any shred of suspicion against him, or
even with no reasonable suspicion. The nefarious habit
of people giving evidence on behalf of any prisoner must
be put down.
In support of these maxims two more cases
have just cropped up. One was known as the
Reddish licensing case. Two policemen swore
that Mrs. Reddish had committed a certain
breach of the Licensing Act; Mr. and Mrs.
Reddish and two other witnesses swore that
there was no such breach. If the Crown did
not feel inclined to let the matter rest at that
it had two courses open to it; it could prose-
cute the police for perjury, or it could prose-
cute the other crowd. Though the weight of
evideuce was against the police, it proceeded to
prosecute the other crowd, as it always does.
Then some curious things happened in this
order :
(1) The two witnesses were convicted by a jury of per-
jury, on the police evidence, for saying the same thing
that the Rkddishks said.
(2) Reddish was acquitted of perjury by another jury,
though he said the same things that the two convicted
men said.
(3) Mrs. Reddish was acquitted of perjury by still
another jury, though she said the same thing that the
two convicted men said, and in her case the Judge
(Hodges) openly declared that, in his opinion, one police-
man witness was lying.
(4) Therefore two juries held that the perjury was on
the side of the police.
(£•) And when the whole batch of cases were over Chief
Justice Madden sentenced the convicted prisoners to nine
and 12 months respectively for perjury because they made
statements which two juries had decided were true, and
for making which two other people had been dismissed
without a stain on their characters.
(6) And the police whose statements, according to the
decision of two juries, were absolutely false, are not
prosecuted at all, for the Victorian Law Department is
not built that way.
Apropos of which another case is worth quot-
ing. The other day Melbourne Criminal Court
produced a fine sample of the ornamental liar.
He had run away from the Salvarmy farm at
Bayswater, and at Cranbourne (Gippsland),
apparently out of pure cugsedness, laid infor-
mation against a young man on a serious charge.
The police-court proceedings failed to disclose
any discrepancy in his evidence, and it was
only by good luck that the defending lawyer
got bold of a clue at the Sessions’ trial. Then
it all came out after this fashion :
Counsel: “ You swear your right name is Frederick
Victor Smith, yet you deliberately stated on oath, at the
police-court, that it was Alexander Robertson, aged 15;
why did you do that? ” “ I didn’t want to get nicked.”
“ YVhat do you mean by that?” “I ran away from the
home at Bayswater, and did not want to get nicked."
“ You ran away from the Army Reformatory, at Bays-
water ?” “Yes, sir.” “Did you not swear at the
police-court that, you had never been to a reformatory ?”
“Yes, sir." “ Then that was another lie ?” “Yes, sir.”
“ Did you not swear that you came down from Ballarat
with the consent of your parents?” “ Yes, sir.” “That,
too, was a lie?” “Yes, sir.” “ And but for the fact that
your right name was discovered, you would have lied
here as you did in the police-court? " “ Yes, sir.” “ Are
you in the habit of telling lies ? ” “ No, sir.”
Then Judge Hodges ordered the witness t
stand down, and discharged the accused in a
great hurry—lest this lovely Crown witness
should get a further showing-up ? But there is
apparently no redress for the unfortunate man
who was put to heavy expense and frightful
mental torture through the vagaries of this
young scoundrel. And, up to time of writ-
ing, it hasn’t occurred to the law to prose-
cute the perjured witness. In Australia,
a Crown witness is practically exempt from
prosecution for perjury. The short and
simple rule of the Crown Law officers appears
to be that all perjury is justifiable as long as it
is done to aid the Crown in convicting an
innocent person. At least, they act on that
principle. In fact, almost every Crown Law
Department in Australia is the tacit accomplice
of perjurers of the Frederick Smith stamp.
But how the average Crown Law officers boil
over at the perjurer who helps to prtcent the
Crown getting a conviction !

The Nearly-Lost Province.
A straw which shows how the wind may pos-
sibly blow some day :
Adelaide, Wednesday.—ln the Legislative Assembly
to-day Mr. Grainger moved that the finances of the
Northern Territory should demand the careful attention
of the House, and he advised that the Government
should either dispose of it to some company willing to
pay the present debt and relieve them of" all further
responsibilities or obtain the permission of the British
Government to relinquish it. He expressed a doubt as to
whether Federated Australia would care to saddle itself
with such an expensive white elephant.
Plainly Australia hasn’t got within sight of
Federation a day, nor half a day, too soon.
Hardly one Australian in 10,000 knows what a
huge danger has been always waiting at this
country’s door. The Northern Territory is not
Australian property, though it is temporarily
“administered’ by S.A. It was to become
Australian property on certain conditions, the
principal of which was the building of the
transcontinental railway, but S.A., though it
built a huge section of that work, was never
able to finish it. The Crow-eater population is
but small, and the work was very large, and it
had to be suspended. For want of this means
of communication it has been impossible to get
enough population into the Territory to make
it pay. South Australia stands the annual loss
of a huge province which isn’t its own, and
which the British Government may take back
at any time. The Territory, in its present
state, is an appalling burden on a small popu-
lation which has to police it, and supply it
with postal facilities, and put its inhabitants in
gaol when they get drunk, and look after its
wharves and telegraphs, and keep its one rail-
way going ; and if nothing happened to make
it pay better than it does, and no Federal Gov-
ernment came along to take it over, the almost
certain result would be that it would some day
go back to British ownership. And then it
would probably be sold to a semi military
British co. which would flood it with Chinese
and nigger cheap labor —and said cheap labor
would constantly slop over into wdiite
Australia, and make it piebald and poor and
leprous. And the co. would probably keep
a military force of its own, which would be to
white Australia the same menace that the
Rhodes and Jamieson crowd has been to the
Transvaal ; and this country, after a period of
complete self government, w ould partly relapse
to the old, degraded status of a crown colony.
The Federal Government can avert this danger.
It can secure the definite surrender of the Ter-
ritory as Federal property if it is only in dead
earnest about the matter. S.A. wants to get
rid of its white elephant, and Britain will
hardly refuse if all Australia demands it. And
though the Territory has been a dead loss to
S.A., it should be a gloriously profitable asset
to the Commonwealth, and worth £2, 000,000 a
year by-and-bye in land-revenue alone. This
rich and well-watered country has been a
failure in the past simply because of its
utter inaccessibility, and because S.A.,
whose whole population is less than that of
Sydney, couldn’t raise the money necessary to
open it up. The Commonwealth Government
can raise the money to open it up—which
makes all the difference. But considering how
very near this great asset lias been on several
occasions to lapsing back to Britain, to be
thereafter jobbed away to some nigger and
Chow importing syndicate, it is evident that
Federation hasn’t come any too soon.
The “ Star’s ” Advice to Lyne.
The disastrous Australian Star started
bright and early last week to give N.S.W.
Premier Lyne advice of the kind that is cal-
culated to cut his Premiership very short
indeed. Of all the Sydney dailies the Star is
the dullest and most wooden-headed ; and the
pity of the thing as regards Lyne is that it is
supposed to be the special organ of the Lyne
party, aud has a big lien on the special job of
advising Lyne as to how he may most speedily
walk over a precipice and be made quite dead.
The Borrowing Policy was the subject on
which the Star first proceeded to breathe its
ancient and fish-like counsel into Lyne’s ear.
It didn’t advise him to leave off borrowing as
any sane paper would have done, but with its
usual dull fatuousness it implored Lyne to
leave off local borrowing—to swear off the only
good feature in the dreadfully bad business—
and raise his loans in London in the good old
way, so that the interest would go out of the
country and be a perpetual drain on its
resources. According to the Star :
It was an unnatural thing, on the face of it, that.large
amounts of local capital in a young country should be
locked up in Govt, securities, instead of flowing through
its proper channels in the shape of private enterprise.
That local capital should be employed in local industry
seemed not only an incontestable maxim in itself, but an
indispensable condition to prosperity. It could not be
supposed that money circulating through Govt, agency,
always with an eye to political necessities, could
afford as much employment to labor, or produce
as much national wealth, as if it were in the
hands of private employers, stimulated by pri-
vate enterprise. The local loans that were regarded
with so much caution by financial authorities before Mr.
Reid assumed otlice afterwards became an established
feature Of his financial system. The risks and dangers
attaching to them accurately predicted then have sinoe
made themselves conspicuous in the actual condition of
the country. In just proportion to the rate at which the
Govt, absorbed local capital private enterprise has
dwindled away, local production has decreased, and the
labor-market has become more and more hopelessly
stagnant. That these things stand in the relation of
cause and effect no unprejudiced observer can deny.
The proof, if any be needed, is abundant and palpable.
The more the market has been flooded with 4 per cent.
Treasury bills, and the more the Trust Funds have been
drafrued in to the rescue, so much the more have these
disastrous effects made themselves apparent from day to
day. If the ten or twelve millions that have been bor-
rowed from local capitalists in this manner had not
been withdrawn from private enterprise the money, or
most of it, at any rate, would certainly have found an out-
let in local undertakings of one kind or another. By that
means, and to that extent, private employers would have
been placed in a position to employ more labor, the volume
of local production would have been enlarged, and the late
Govt, would not have been driven to the humiliating'
necessity of appointing an Advisory Board to help them
out of the unemployed difficulty. When that point in
the downward path was reached it was surely high time
to call a halt. The longer the present system is con-
tinued the worse will the situation become. Common
prudence suggests that a limit must sooner or later be
placed to the absorption of local capital, and with such
evidence as we have before us the conclusion is irresistible
that the sooner it is done the better.
The Star, in short, is grieved to its inmost
soul that N.S. YV. should have begun to show
some small speck of self-reliance, and it im-
plores Lyne to leave it off at once. But the
whole story about the “ withdrawal of capital
from private enterprise” is pitiable bunkum.
If N.S. W. borrows £2,000,000 or £20,000,000
in the country for public works, and spends it
in the country on public works, then the
money never leaves the country at all. It
isn’t “ withdrawn.” The country has the rail-
ways and other works, and so far it is a gainer,
but there isn’t a penny less available to “flow
through its proper channels in the shape of
private enterprise.” Both principal and interest
remain in the country. But if N.S.W.
borrows £2,000,000 in London at 3§ per
cent, for public works, at the end of 30
years it has sent away £2,100,000 in inter-
est, and in 60 years it has sent away
<£4,200.000 in interest, and so on ad infinitum.
It is foreign—not local—borrowing that takes
away money that should be available for pri-
vate enterprise. Owing to foreign borrowing
over £2,000,000 that should be available for
private enterprise is going out of N.S.YV.
every year, and it is this huge outflow which
makes N.S.W. so poor. The theory of Pre-
mier Lyne’s fatal adviser is that N.S.W. will
be ruined unless it has to send away plenty of
money every year as interest, and if that in-
terest money remains in the country the re-
sults will be disastrous. In fact, it holds that
the province is in desperate straits for money
through not having to pay so much money to
England as it should do ; and that if it had to
send away more money then it would naturally
have more money left. If Premier Lyne wants
to do the greatest and noblest thing in N.S.W.
history he will swear off borrowing altogether.
If he can’t rise to that he will at least do the
second best thing if he utterly swears off
foreign borrowing. And if lie knows when to
come in out of the wet he will swear off the
Australian Star, as a disastrous counsellor
whose capacity for being wrong is utterly
past belief.
The Sweating* of a Surplus.
Premier Turner’s conscience must at times,
when it catches him revelling in the beauti-
ful proportions of his surplus, give him a
bad half-hour. Also, the same conscience has
opportunity to make sundry sarcastic observa-
tions to him and his brother Minister, Peacock,
when these two ponder over the provisions of
the Amending Factories’ Act. For that part of
the Treasurer’s surplus which is not accounted
for by the natural increase in the province’s
prosperity appears to be chiefly due to unre-
stricted sweating, for which the Treasurer and
Chief-Sec. aforesaid are largely responsible.
In the bad times following the boom the
pruning-knife was applied with great vigor, and
the Victorian public would have promptly
sacked any Treasurer who attempted to raise
the salaries of any class of public servants.
But now that things are so far improved that it
is seriously proposed to relieve the wealthier
income - receivers of some of their alleged
burdens, it is the business of Parliament
to compel the State-housekeeper to pay his
servants decent wages before blewing his
income in the reckless fashion he intends.
There are three classes of employes in Vic.
Public Service to-day who are as outrageously
sweated as any worker for an undercutting
slop-clothier or boot-factory. Between ’B9 and
’9O some 200 men were taken on by the Post
Office as messengers, at a maximum salary of
£6O, less insurance and sundry other small
deductions. They were given to understand
that they w r ould ultimately be transferred to
the clerical and letter-carrying branches.
These men, many of whom now vary in age
from 24 to 29 and have wives and families, are
at present employed in operating and clerical
work. They do the same work as is done by
others alongside them at from £lOO to £240
per annum, yet they are still called messengers
and still receive their £6O per year. One has
full charge of a fair-sized post-and-telegraph
office at about £1 a week. There are also 1553
pupil teachers employed by the Education Dept.
Many of these, having remained stationary,
in the matter of grading, during the post-
boom years, are now men and women of from
25 to 35. They have passed three stiff exams. ;
they are qualified teachers ; they do work for
which others working alongside them are paid
at from £l5 to £25 per month, and they are
paid at a maximum rate—less insurance and
other deductions —of, men £5O, women £4O per
annum. The third case is that of the lunatic-
asylum warders and wardresses. The maximum
pay here is £54 and £6O per year, which in
itself is a paltry remuneration for any man or
woman in any kind of work. But the sinful-
ness of their treatment lies chiefly in the fact
that the Govt, demands their atttendance at
the asylums for no less than 98 hours per
week 1 1 Writer has inspected the attendance-
books of both male and female attendants at
Kew Asylum, in addition to having separate
statements from the persons themselves. Their
sweating employer actually works them 77 hours
per week and compels them to remain in their
rooms at the asylum—where they can be called
at any moment—for a further 21 hours
per week. These men and women, as
public servants, are refused the right of
laying their case before the public through
the press. They are also refused access
to members of Parliament individually, though
they may petition that august assemblage ; and
when a private member does altempt to obtain
something like decent treatment for those of
them who are his constituents lie is told that
“ the Premier has no sympathy with public
service complaints, and that there are plenty
of hard up unemployed outside that service.”
Also Minister of Mines Foster met one com-
plaint with the brutal irrelevancy, “ Are there
any public servants starving?” Well, if a
man has to keep a wife and family on £1 a
week, or a woman of 35 has to maintain her-
self, pay her insurance, buy her necessary
books, &c., on 15s. a week—if that isn’t
starvation it comes as near to it as makes no
differ ence.
A CURIOUS commentary on the “value’ of
human testimony is furnished by the wide dis-
crepancies between the impressions produced
upon different observers (the newspaper cor-
respondents) of the same Dreyfus at the same
time :
(1) A man 3.) ; hair white as silver, and at the back
of the crown bald ; face bolh burned and pale—a larg-e-
-featured face with a pointed chin . . . face suffering a
misery hardly to be borne.
(2) He walked with light elastic step ; his brow un-
clouded by recent suffering, and his joyousness at the
sight of the vast concourse of his fellow-men “ sunned ”
the spectators.
(3) Ninety-nine persons out of 100 would set down as
an old man this individual with the grey, clos ly-cut
hair, somewhat large ears, and stooped shoulders.
(4) He steps on the platform with a firm swing, salutes,
aces his judges for an instant, and takes seat.
(5) The figure of a student and of a military man com-
bined ; straight, and yet shoulders rounded like those of
an aged clerk. The back of his head projects beyond the
curve of the shoulders in an ugly way.
(6) His closelv-oropped hair is white, but the face clean-
shaven, except for the well-trimmed black moustache, is
ruddy with health. The eyes are steadfast, and the
whole attitude bespeaks strength and determination.
(7) A cool, calculating man, ever on his guard. Steps
cautiously, puts his chair exactly as he wants it; and
seats himself with precision.
(8) A face foxy in its cunning—nothing to denote the
Jew, except something in the sharp, blue eyes.
Yet all these people were trying to be accurate.
“We find what we expect to find ! ” Think of
it, ye jurors, when holding in your hands the
balance of life—or death.

Brisbane Telegraph still plods away at its
uninteresting old semi-perjury about how Bris-
bane and South and Central Queensland “gave
a majority against the Bill.” Recently the
figures were : Centre, federal majority, 1832 ;
South, federal majority, 16; Brisbane, anti-
federal majority, 4091. And, by lumping the
three together, you can make a lie with some
semblance of truth about it to the effect that
the three districts gave an anti-federal majority
of 2243. That is how the Brisbane parson-
ridden paper does it. It is the same as saying
that Brisbane and Victoria together gave a
majority of 120,000 for Federation ; or that
Queensland and China put together give a
majority of 998 followers of Confucius to one
Christian ; or that in Toowoomba and Central
Africa put together 95 per cent, of the people
are black, and nearly naked, and can’t read,
and worship idols. Also, it is the same as say-
ing that Brisbane and bell put together show
such a vast majority of fiends as compaied with
decent people that Sodom and Gomorrah weren’t
a patch on them for wickedness ; and that, if
you take the editor of Brisbane Telegraph' and
Nero and Caligula together it is two to one
the party would as soon murder you as look at
you. Also, if you take Thargomindah and the
North Pole together the average temperature
of the two places is about zero. Of course, the
statement is true—yet, all the same, you
couldn’t find a snowball in Thargoniindah to
save your life. And Brisbane Telegraph’s
half-true lie is built on just these principles.

The Maffra (Vic.) Beet Sugar Industry, born
of fatuous ignorance and nourished on supine
lassitude, having temporalily collapsed, the
Vic. Govt., which advanced some £62,000
towards its establishment, has taken charge of
the factory with a view to keeping the
machinery and plant in order, and have sent
an expert up to teach the local farmer how to
capture the i-ugar-beet in its native lair. It
proposes to pay the expert a bonus on every
ton grown until such time as the person-on-the-
land shall have found a way of growing beets
at a profit. Whereupon Melb. Argus rises to
remark that the chief cause of the trouble is
the State’s intermeddling with private enter-
prise, carefully ignoring the fact that the State
in this case didn’t intermeddle with private
enterprise, for there wasn’t any. In giving
evidence before Melbourne’s Want of Employ-
ment Commission, Mr. Catani, Roads and
Bridges Engineer, put his finger on the
sore spot in this matter, and incident-
ally threw out a valuable suggestion. Said
Mr. Catani: “If you put 500 poor people
on the rich land at Boisdale (Maffra), and get
them to thin the land and grow tire beet, you
will produce sugar. The fault is that the people
there now are too rich, and will not take the
trouble.” Which is frozen truth ! And seeing
that there are idle hands in Melbourne, and
suitable land and a thoroughly-equipped fac-
tory at Maffra, there is here a grand opportu-
nity for a go-ahead Govt, to see what it can do
working “on its own ” —as a producer. Also,
it might prove a satisfactory method of coping,
to a moderate extent, with the “ unemployed
difficulty.” In any case, it couldn’t make a
worse exhibition of itself than utterly incom-
petent private enterprise has done in this case.
An important and debatable question : Would
it nob be better to bring an accuser before the
suspected person and, for identification pur-
poses, ask him bluntly, “Is this the man ? ”
rather than, as at present, putting the suspect in
a group and leaving the accuser to pick and
choose ? It is plain that the accuser’s sense of
responsibility would be greater in the former
case; it is also plain that if that way were
adopted the police, who have had a verbal
description of the guilty man, and who, having
found a man to answer the description (more
or less), place on either hand men wholly un-
like, would be shorn of a power frequently
abused. “Is that the man ? ” concentrates the
accuser’s mind on a single object and euables
him to notice points of likeness and unlikeness
liable to escape in the comparison of one indi-
vidual with several. Ou the other hand, of

The little six-nights’ seison of “ Pygmalion
and Galatea,” at Her Majesty’s, is so very short
and sudden that it will he almost over by the
time this issue catches the public eye. The fact
that calls for loudest mention, therefore, is that
“The Christian” follows on Saturday, for the
first time in Australia, and the tale of Glory and
John Storm will be on till further notice. The
present show is a satisfactory performance, after
a certain unobtrusive fashion. Thomas Kingston
makes a good Pygmalion, though his rendering of
the part isn’t equal to his Northern Spy in “Secret
Service.” Miss Henrietta Watson does Galatea
pleasantly and gracefully, though not quite so
cleverly nor quite so gracefully as din Essie
Jenyns of yore. And Hawtrey’s Chrysos is re-
sectable, though it doesn’t come within 25i miles
of Charles Fabert’s fat, unctuous Greek in ye olden
time. Fabert, who never did anything brilliant
otherwise, built up a fat and overwhelming Chrysos
who is the record Australian Chrysos to date ;
his aggressive corpulence, his bcw-leggedness, his
enquiring leer, his oily |>onip, his vulgarity, his
greasily paternal aspect, and his general semblance
of being a Greek alderman of the remote 8.C., made
that Cnrysos a remembei-somo patron of the arts.
Hawtrey isn’t fat enough, nor clumsy enough, to
lend point to the statue-girl’s remark about his
uncoutliness ; nor does he sown sufficiently alder-
manic, nor sufficiently like an old Greek cheese-
monger, to be inkeepingwith the patron who bought
statuary by the half-ton. Yet though nobody in
the co. towers very high, nobody falls with an
obtrusive thud into utter contempt, and the
statue-show is a good level one throughout. In
the case of George Majeroni’s Leucine, it is fully
as level as a billiard table. Miss Etliel Appleton s
Cynisca, and the Myrine of Miss Rose Musgrove,
however, help materially to prevent things being a
lot worse than they would be if they weren’t nearly
so good as they are.

“A White Stocking,” in one act, which
precedes the principal production, awoke glad an-
ticipations in a city which recently saw Mrs.
Brough publicly pulling up her leg-gloves. It is
a pretty little play, but the public was grieved on
oi>ening night to find that it was a horse, and not
a lady, that wore the pallid sock in question.
Cecil Ward rides the animal with the pale gar-
ment on its feet, and goes forth, for a giddy wager,
to plunder a nobleman on the highway, but it
being dark, he plunders his best girl’s father in-
stead. And when he calls on his best gill an
hour later, the old man recognises the horse
with the clean clothes on its leg, and takes
things seriously, and wants his money bock, and
as Cecil Ward has lost the money ana can’t give
it back, he gets talked nearly to death by the
terrible old parent. Hawtrey, Cecil Ward, Lis-
sant, and Miss Musgrove do this trifle among
them, and do it well—Lissant especially.
He * He He
The last complete week of Brough’s season
at Sydney Royal is occupied with “A Village
Priest.” After that there will be three short one-
night barks —“Mrs. Tanqueray ” on Saturday;
“Dandy Dick” on Monday, and “Niobe”on
Tuesday, and on Wednesday there will be empti-
ness, and shadows, and dust, and rats, and a feel-
ing that some valued friends have departed. The
“ Village Priest ” hasn’t been revived in Sydney
for a long time, and, judging by its reception, the
revival fills a want that is larger than the ordinary
backyard tank. It is the only modern play with
a miracle in it —that leaf of the Bible that slowly
rises like a condemned man’s hair or the tail of tho
pleased cat at breakfast time, and bristles up for
a moment in the limelight, and then turns over,
leaving the abbe staring at the text wherein lies
an answer to the prayer lie has prayed for 19
years. It isn’t a very definite text, though he
gathers from it that he must break the seal
of confession, and extract the holy cork of
the church, and unbottle the gruesome tale
about how the Judge who sentenced Jean
Torquenie for murder was himself the assassin;
but if the text is rather indefinite, the miracle is
smart and effective. It says much for Brough’s
stage-management, that all the'time he has played
the “Priest,” that pallid leaf has risen impres-
sively in the east and set in the west without a
hitch. Joseph Game’s abbe is a satisfying character
in every respect, and if there were more priests
like him, and fewer like the hurrying, hot, flushed
stout father that one meets in everyday life, the
writer would —but, on second thoughts, he pro-
bably wouldn’t. Brough fills his old place as
Jean Torquenie for all it is worth. There are
no conspicuous female parts in the “Priest,” but
Miss Bessie Thompson makes a loveable old blind
lady with that artistic finish that she puts into
all her characters. Mrs. Brough fills a small,
sad part very cleverly, and Miss Noble does
her little streak of girlish prettiness in a way
that satisfies everybody. One remnant of the
original cast that is much missed is Miss
Bessie Major as the abbe’s housekeeper. The
housekeeper is a very small but Miss
Major made a great deal out of her. That lady,
by the way, was rather a mvstery. In the old
days she used to transpire on the stage about once
in six months or so, and though she transpired
very well, that fact seemingly didn’t encourage
her to transpire any more frequently. And then
at last, a long time ago, she left off transpiring
altogether, and the abbe got a new housekeeper.

On Saturday night between 5000 and 0000
people gathered together at Red fern (Sydney)
in the largest tent this writer ever saw to watch
the opening of the Flying Jordans’ circus and
hippodrome. Many things happened that even-
ing. There were three events going on simultane-
ously, high up in tho air, when suddenly a pink
figure that swung and swayed between the rings
seemed to shoot straight out, and the audience
gasped as it whirled downwards and struck the
ground with a “wough.” The lady that fell
never seemed to utter a sound. When they
picked her up she smiled and waved her hands to
the audience. Then they bore her away in a
chair, the bell rang, and the cloud people came
down to earth again. A cloud of clowns trotted
on ; a small boy built himself a tower of chairs
and contorted on top of the trembling edifice,
while on the stage a huge frog gibbered at
the people and tied his legs in knots. Then
what seemed a tiny dot of a girl came out
and climbed up on to a little platform about the
size of a chair and opening a Japanese umbrella
stepped out boldly into empty space. The dot
was a wire-walker of no ordinary kind, but when
she threw herself down (into a net) the public hair
stood up for a moment —the public hadn’t got its
nerves in order again and wanted something with
a stick in it. The Farley trio gave their balancing
feat and some weird mephistophelian figures in
red did indescribable things with their legs
—and just about then the electric-light
gave a flash and went out, The tent was in the
deep twilight of four flickering gasolene lights.
More flickers were brought, but the crowd on the
northern side, seeing two sparring exhibitions and
a woman juggling on the platform, crowded for-
ward and packing themselves round the performers
blotted out the whole show. A mighty wind came
up and shook the tent, and timid people be-
came alarmed and left. Suddenly there was
great shouting to clear the course, and the crowd
stCK>d on chairs and craned its collective neck in
wild excitement, as a dim ghostly outline of a
human head and body glided through the gloom,
while behind rushed a dark figure on horseback.
It looked like a human soul fleeing from the sins
of its youth ; in reality, it was Olaf Schrader on
his bike, racing Pawnee Bill on horseback. They
fled round and round, till at last Bill overtook and
rode right over the cyclist and trod on him amidst
thunders of applause. One man evidently forgot
the age he lived in. and held out his hand with
the thumb turned down. Two Roman chariots
came out and started to gallop through the gloom ;
the one with cream horses winning by a length.
Then a tall human apparition with a fearsome
headdress fled round the ring, pursued by the
dark Bill who hail already claimed one victim.
The apparition ran like a lost soul before a fiend
with a toasting-fork, hut the horse broke into a
gallop and passed him. About this time the
gloom became too thick, and the show left off.
On Monday night it opened again with a repaired
electric-light, and everything went smoothly.

Tho rather indefinite career of tho Asiatic
insurgent leaves off shortly at the Criterion. On
Saturday Rignold reappears as Paolo Macari in
“ Called Back,” and if he is anything like the old
Macari the show should pay rent and gas and
other burdens and liabilities for a week or two.
There have been sundry changes in the cast of the
“Mutiny.” Miss Wheeler is absent and Miss
Helene Burdette plays the colored heroine in the
long, gay clothes, and whirls round the big gun
which is fired atNebu Singh’s horde. She fills the
part very well, but on her first night the big gun
sent in its resignation and refused to go off, though
the horde stood iu front of it very patiently. The
curtain came down disgustedly, and the gun was
remonstrated with. Then the curtain went up
again, and the gun went off with a sheet of flame
that appeared to set the horde on fire in eight
places. Brown Augustus has also given up being
chief insurgent, anil Johnson Weir fills his place,
while a rather unsatisfactory kind of person runs
for assistance iu Johnson’s old character.

The loud trumpet-blare of “ Tommy At-
kins, ” which al ways turns up somewhere when there
is talk of war, is blowing loudly and hard this
week at Sydney Lyceum. War oil the stage isn’t
a means of settling international differences ; it is
merely a device for killing off the dramatist’s ac-
cumulated stock of wicked captains, so as to make
room for tho new season’s shipments. If it wasn’t
for war the dramatist’s wicked captains would
have to die of old age and ingrowing toe-nail, or
be run over by an escaped cask of beer bounding
downhill. “Tommy Atkins ”is a drama wherein
the captain has two wives—one of whom he shoots,
while lie shows tho other a nice, quiet ferny place
in the river, where she may drown herself and in-
fant comfortably. Then he goes away as a polished
gentleman should when a lady is thinking of
drowning herself. He knows that she is poor, and
has torn stockings and broken boots, because ho
never buys her any new ones; and he feels that
she won’t like him to lute these details when she is
inverted in the air on I .or way over the bridge. It
is otherwise roinarhable on account of a rich
Christian who, when his prodigal daughter comes
home, expresses the hope that she will die miser-
ably of cold feet under a tree somewhere, with a
snowball for a pillow; and a curate, who on see-
ing his inhospitable conduct, takes off the crow-
like garb of his sacred calling, and kicks it into
next week, and enlists- in disgust. After which
events the captain goes on being wicked to the
end ; and after trying to marry a third wife, and
being forcibly removed from the altar where he
is defiling the sacred edifice with language,
and after endeavouring to sell his country, and
doing all the other cardinal sins, ho dies in the
wilderness, using shocking expressions in his last
moments. The old Cliristian gentleman remains
bitter to the end, and never forgives his lost
daughter. The curate stays out of the Church
all his days, and retains a low opinion of it to the
end. And the good young man called Ehenezer,
who takes to drink, remains drinking—in fact,
the writer makes no laborious effort to clean up
his characters, and lets most of them go their own
way, which is probably the best he could do with
them. The Bulletin has a vague idea that it
rather likes “Tommy Atkins,” but it has no re-
liable information on this point.

.Rickards’ burnt-out company has now
settled down at Sydney Palace, and lias partially-
replaced the large and expensive wardrobes which
were reduced to ashes at the old establishment.
Pathetic tales are going about as to the immense
losses which xvere sustained when the former
trousers and vests took fire, and the previous bell-
toppers were singed. The average actor, when
one meets him on a steamer, appears to have as
small a carpet-bag as any other citizen, but when
he is burnt-out ho creates as much ash in the
advertisement as if he were a four-storey clothing
warehouse. Anyhow, it is pleasing to note that
the 00. is as well-dressed as ever.
The Bulletin’s occasional contradictions of
the story re Amy Castles and J. C. Williamson’s
proposal to take her voice on a Ion" lease, were
seemingly not quite true in fact, although they
expressed the real meaning of the wily manager’s
negotiations. The original tale spread by little
Miss Amy’s boomsters was offered as evidence of
the damsel’s glorious future. It was said that
Mr. Williamson proposed to pack her off to Mar-
chesi per next boat, pay for her education, and
subsidise her family for three years, at the end of
which long period she would be required to re-
turn to Australia on a two years’ engagement.
He was to “risk ”£3OOO, said the tarradiddle, on
the chance of getting it all back with enormous
profits in 1903-4. This would have been a splen-
did confession of faith in the young lady’s voice,
and the question now arises—Did the boomsters
in charge of the “ Future Melba ” misrepresent the
case, or did the Melb. newspaper paragraphists
carefully suppress the principal clause in the pro-
posal ? The best offer that manager Williamson
made was designed for his own immediate benefit
—a sound business offer, with no sort of risk at-
taching to it. He was to give 12 Castles concerts
in Australia, and scoop the whole pool previous to
sending Miss Castles away to be educated at his
expense. In short, J. C. W. was prepared to buy
up the boom on the chance of making a
profit of two or three thousand pounds within
three months. He reckoned on getting about
£5090 from the 12 concerts, to meet an obligation
of about half that amount. And if there ever was
a great future in Amy’s voice; it is a pity
for her that her parents didn’t sign J. C. W.’s
bond. He would have kept her top note on the
chain (when she wasn’t singing as per contract),
and sent her ’ome in good vocal condition.

“ The Geisha” gets a grateful reception at
Melb. Princess’s, and the advt. mentions that it
will continue until further notice. For the last
six months Melbourne has been prepared to wel-
come the Firm’s Comic Opera co. in any popular
item. “The Geisha” was the gaudiest and
freshest thing on the list of available revivals, and
for several reasons, apart from the opera's own
solid merits, the “further notice ” aforesaid seems
likely to be held over for another fortnight, or
more. “Geisha ” matinees on Wednesdays.

Touching the Bijou programme, there is
nothing to say this week except Cinquevalli, and
touching Cinquevalli, The Bulletin will merely
remark, “Wonderful!” in the same tone of voice
as before. The famous juggler has now arrived
at his very last nights. On Wednesday of next
week he will give his farewell performance in
Melbourne, and Melbourne may be expected to
give him the biggest and most intelligent burst of
applause it has ever hurled at a star-performer
since Sarah Bernhardt took her leave. The city
has slowly absorbed the fact that Cinquevalli—
strong man, graceful man, acrobat, juggler and
balancer —is positively incomparable. And the
incomparable person, when found, is a reasonable
excuse for indulging in a wild, healthful whoop on
the occasion when one is never going to look upon
his like again.
Two concert seasons will be concluded at
Melb. Town Hall on Saturday. In the afternoon
Scherek gives the sixteenth and last of his admir-
able Orchestral Concerts, and in the evening
Mdlle. Trebolli is to give her positively last Song
Recital. This is the time o’ year when Melbourne
turns off its musical gas at the meter, and ••‘•sorts
to savage out door life.
One notable feature of the Dreyfus case
is that a French officer’s commission is his
property, of which lie can only be deprived by
process of law. An English officer’s services may
be “dispensed with” at tho pleasure of the
Crown, and he has no appeal. That is why
Dreyfus, the first sentence against him having been
quashed, appeared at Rennes in uniform. The
socond sentence of 10 years in a fortress does not
seem to carry with it iiis dismissal from the ser-
vice—at least the cable doesn’t say so.
Henry Malcolm Deakin, erstwhile a well-
known and popular Sydney citizen, who, like
many others, came to financial grief at- the end of
the boom, and went to Westralia to repair his for-
tunes, died in Mr. Fitzgerald’s private hospital,
Melbourne, on Sept. 10, aged 44 years. He had
just made a large fortune by leasing the Collie
(W. A.) collieries and selling the output thereof for
years ahead to a big Adelaide firm, when he was
overtaken by a cerebral trouble which firstly
necessitated the removal of an eye and then the
desperate expedient of trephining, to which
latter operation he succumbed.
One of the brilliant lights of the Vic. House
of Rich Landlords was in rare form at the Melb.
Dreyfus meeting, last week, and, when it was
proposed to cable the sympathetic message to
Fiuauo, he put in his humble negative. “I don’t
believe in sending the message to this Figger-rovv,
or whatever he’s called,” he said ; “I've got no
faith in these French officials. I think the message
ouglit to be sent to one of the newspapers.’’ The
aitchless M.L.C. was evidently under the impres-
sion that Fioako was some sort of a potentate,
like the Rajah or the Mikado. Another eminent
M.L.C. aired his wisdom and his statistics in the
Legislature, last week, on population. “ The
deaths during 1898,” he said, “ were nought hun-
dred and noughty nought, including those of
children, while the births during the same period
were 1000 less— also includinu those of children.”
Nobody laughed. “And these be thy gods, 0
Israel.”
“A Soldier and a Man ” was constructed on the
plan
Of a dozen melo-dramas where the British Flag
conies in,
And we knew the other night, when we saw the
hero “tight,”
He would have to fight for Hingland, and be
cleansed of his sin
By the blood of many supers
Who presume to face the troopers
Of the only blessed army that can ever hope to
win—
Of the blessed British Army that is ever bound to
win.
A Soldier and a Man, when the narrative began,
Was accused of crooked dealings in a quiet game
of Nap.,
Which made Lis credit shrink, till he drowned his
grief in drink,
And his wife said “ Don’t be selfish, let me liquor
too, old chap,”
For the tempting glass was handy :
But he flung away the brandy,
And a girl reuruitiug-sorgeant pinned some ribbon
to his cap—
Pinned some temperance blue ribbon to the
brandy-waster’s cap.
To South Africa he went, whore a wicked mining
gent
Tried to get him into trouble whilst ho battled for
the Queen;
But the villain always fails in these illustratod
tales—
O, the Truth prevails o’er him in the good old
final scene.
And this hero’s faithful missis
Came and smothered him with kisses,
His innocence was proven, and we left ’em both
serene :
You can bet your bottom dollar that we left ’em
all serene.
’Tis a wcll-appointod show, so we think it ought
to go
With the Melbourne Royal public, who are fond
of Love and War ;
The heroine, wo guess, scored a pretty big success;
She oan quite express tier feelings, and sue fairly
holds tho floor.
Likewise hero John D. Saunders
Is a man who seldom maunders,
And he shmethas a shoddor of tho lurking Zulus’
gore—
He’s a free-and-easy shodder of the luckless
heathen’s gore.
Shall the truth bo bluntly told, re tho pauper-
mother old,
Who suddenly deceases when she’s seated on a
chair ?
We prefer to droop our head in the presence of
the dead,
And forget her stagey accent and hor artificial
liair;
And the sergeant-girl-recruiter !
Not at present will we shoot her
With our popgun of displeasure—for we haven’t
time to spare,
We could paragraph her badly—but we haven’t
time to spare.
Our life is but a span, and “A Soldier and a
Man ”
Provides a brief distraction for our weary, worldly
mind,
We have sampled better plays in the bygone
Saturdays,
But a piece that pays the management has virtue
of a kind.
Brief our life of joy and sorrow,
Here to-day, and gone to-morrow ;
To meet what next may happen we are patiently
resigned,
And the more we meet this drama, well, the more
we’ll be resigned.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The Soddon Govt, has started to truckle a little
harder to that easy • going public sentiment which
demands railways and other public works, and doesn't
want to pay for them, so a £1,000,000 Loan Hill has gone
through Maoriland Parliament with no opposition worth
mentioning. In this matter the Seddon Govt, is foolishly
throwing away a splendid opportunity. There are
£2.700,000 of gold lying idle, and earning nothing, and
doing no possible good to anybody, in the M. 1,. banks.
And, if Maoriland bar! courage enough to adopt the Cana-
dian law, which has been proved workable by many
years’ service, it would enact that the hanks must keep 40
percent, of their reserves in legal-tender State notes, and
thereby it would get Jtl.loo.ono of this money as a per-
petual loan, without any interest at all. and without
doing the least damage to anybody. And within the
next few years, as population and the stock of money
increased, it wotihi probably get another million on the
same terms. The money Maoriland wants to complete its
three big trunk railways is lying at its door waiting to
be picked up gratis—and the Seddon crowd hasn't the
courage or the energy to pick it up.

The Modern Permanent P.uilding Society (Mel-
bourne) got to the end of its financial year on .list July,
1809, with a loss of 1.15,469. The last eight years of this
rather disastrous concern have been as follows :
July, 1892—Profit.. £16,752 July, 1896—Loss .. £11,431
„ 1893 „ .. 51 JS: 17— „ .. 7.511
„ 1894-Loss .. 13.800 „ IS9S „ .. 10.343
„ 1895 „ .. 2,030 „ IS99 „ .. 15.4C9
This unhappy episode finally extinguishes the reserve
fund and leaves a debit of £033 against capital. Vet,
despite the melancholy outward aspect of things, the
position appears to have improved a good deal during the
past year. The loss incurred bv sales of property below
its cost to the society was £15,750; so apart from this
item the institution paid its way and had a profit of £231.
During the last three years the profits and losses, apart
from losses on properties sold below book-value, have
been as follows :
July, 1897 ... Loss £1193 I July, 1599 ... Profit £231
„ 1898 ... „ 1671 I
Taking all things into consideration, it is doubt-
ful if the Modern Permanent is doing well to force its
properties on the market on such disastrous terms just
now. It is set forth in the balance-sheet that rents are
going up in Melbourne, and property values are increas-
ing, and the fact that the institution is now earning
enough to pay interest on its deposits and all working-
expenses strongly corrobotafes the statement. The
returns for 1899 are fully £1950 better than those for
1898. There is no obligation to pay more than 2 k per
cent, to depositors until 1903, unless it is earned—and it
needn't- he earned ; surplus profits can he used to write off
depreciation without selling the property. Also, there is
no obligation to start repaying the principle of the de-
posits till 1902 or 1903. Under these conditions, it looks
as if the policy of selling at heavy loss just now, instead
of nursing the assets for a year or so is ill-advised. The
Modern owed £438,172 of deposits and debentures in
1597, and £420,522 in 1898, and now it owes £399,773, so it
hast) t made much of a reduction so far despite the big
sacrifice caused by dumping its assets on a debilitated
market.

broken Tlill Water Supply Co. finished its most
affluent half-year up to date on 30th June, 1899. Since
’94 the profits of the co. have been as follows
Profit. Dividkxd.
June, 1894 .. £7,844 2\ per cent. = £2,331
December, 1894 5,076 71 „ = 6 993
June, 1595 .. 4,882 5 „ = 4,’062
December, 1895 12,901 10 ~ = 9,325
June, 1596 .. 6,686 10 „ = 9,325
December, 1896 10,077 5 „ = 4 062

December, 1898 15,760 10 „ = 9 325
June, 1899 .. 16,161 15 „ = 13)988
£120,236 £88,586
During the past 5$ years, therefore, the co. has earned
£31,650 over ami above dividends. Of this 14,485 has
been written off for depreciation, and the balance, added
to the £4,964 on hand prior to June '94, leaves the co.
with £32,129 accumulated funds (£24,629 profit balance,
and £7,500 contingency reserve).
One thing suggested ivy these figures is that
£4485 is a very small allowance for depreciation on
£170,000 worth of property. And there is room for the
same old complaint about that old asset, “ Water rights,
leases, parliamentary hills. &c., at cost, £25,194.” This
is virtually goodwill. It represents money expended on
promoting the co., against which expenditure I here are
no visible assets. When the co.’s concession expires there
will be nothing at all to show for this item, and it will
have to he entirely written off. Why .the co. doesn’t set
about the work at once passes comprehension. Leaving
out this goodwill item, the broken Hill Water Supply has
itscapital intact and £6936 of reserves—alwavs assuming
that sufficient provision has been made for depreciation.

The wholesale beer-fiends of Australia certainly
do “ go it strong.” In a case recently heard in the Sydney
courts Tooth and Co. had advanced £2309 on mortgage
of a hotel at Alexandria with the usual condition that the
borrower should buy from them only. A dispute having
arisen, they wanted the court to decide that the house
was “ tied ” for ever and ever in terms of the deed—that
even when the loan was ancient history the borrower and
all his successors, so long as the hotel stood (for hundreds
of years if the hotel stood so long), were hound to buy
Tooth's beer only ! And it was quite a shock to the tieci-
honse industry when the law decided that if the borrower
paid off the loan and interest lie would thereafter cease
to be an enslaved heer-seller, and could buy his beer
wherever lie pleased.

Apropos the outsiders’ (mostly Britishers) howl
about the iniquity of the Boers’ div.-tax, &o. A popular
contention is that, the fact that the mines were left to
foreigners to work proves the Boers unfit to own the
country. The Straits Settlements are British ; but out-
siders own nearly all of the tin-mines. Vet there is no
proposal that Britain should clear out. (The position in
the Northern Territory, by the way, is much the same).
Also, the Govt, in the Straits levies a duty of 13 per cent,
on mineral exports. The Master Miners’ Association’,
mainly Chinese, has been vigorously objecting to that for
months past; hut there lias been no cable about it. Quite
likely, however, there have been crushing remarks in the
Chinese papers ; and who knows but that some Ctiinese
volunteer majahs haven't been offering their services in
the matter?

Several of the Southern moneyed crowd are
already standing on velvet over the recovery of land-
prices. Three or four years bock city and suburban pro-
perty fell to prices as ridiculously low as they were high
in boom-times and those who were not panic-stricken
took advantage of the opportunity. One of these snapped
a block offered to the indigent writer for £5 10s. a foot
(it went for £4O in ’88), and last week lie got out at £l2
10s.—a profit of over 120 per cent, in three years.

B.TI. Block 14 is showing material improve-
ment : some payable new ground is being opened, though
tlie grade is still low. Its neighbor, the British, after a
run of much better luek than usual, is rather on the
down-grade again. And its neighbor, the Junction, by
the exposure of native silver in a thin vein of sulphides,
proves that, the possibilities of this remarkable mine have
not yet been exhausted.

The success of the (mostly German) Australian
Met.al Co. in handling the 15.11. zinc “ tailings” by mag-
netic concentration, with tlie primary object of reducing
the bulk prior to export, has turned all 15. H. managers’
heads that way for ihe moment. The managements of
the Central (Sulphide Corporation), Block 14, South,
North and Junction North are already represented in
patent applications ; and an ex-manager of the Pinnacles
(Odling) is also an applicant—he has been experimenting
on these lines for seven or eivht years, and may thus lie
regarded as the pioneer of the idea as applied to 8.11.
sulphides. Apparently there is going to be a big fight
over the patent applications, in which the 8.11. Prop,
will take a hand—as an objector, it is understood.

Broken Hill mine employes have long com-
plained that, they were repulsed when they sought to
submit ideas for improving ore-treating methods. Lately,
however, probably in view of the very modified success of
all processes so far tried, more encouragement has been
given to the rank and file ; and the comparatively new
general manager of the 15.1 f. Prop, lias now capped this
by offering a substantial reward for any information or
suggestion which may lead to improved methods either
of treating Ihe ores or working the mine. As many old
Cornish miners do know a little about ore-dressing, this
may lead to something.

tional fee hefore he will start to work. I remonstrate,

The Turon "River dredging business is the latest
mining outrage on N.S. Wales. The weekly tip-
ster kept the game of boom up to the very last.
A gentleman had been up to see the dredge said
everything was very satisfactory, and people were
advised to go in as a solid and permanent investment.
Well here’s the result:—“ Gold taken off the mats during
the opening-out operations to 22nd July, 930 z. Four
weeks from 24th July to 19th August, from mats, 1520 z.,
or 3Soz. per week. Cleaned-up bo!tom of paddock,
dredged between 24th July and 19th August, Ooz.
Total gold won, 2510 z., worth about £3 18s. per
oz.” Suppose the co. has been at work for
10 weeks, and it is more than that, the return
represents 250 z. a week. This from a show whose
market - value has been varying from £75,000 to
£100,000! S.M. Herald says, in a skim-milk fashion;
“ Tlie result was received on 'Change with some expres-
sions of disappointment.” The D.T. says the return is
disappointing as regards the bnt'om of the.paddock, hut
the return from the gravelly na-h shows a good margin
of profit, Great Scott!—less than £lOOO worth of gold.
Why, IOOOoz. would have been a disappointment after all
tlie months of newspaper-booming this dredging-scheme
has received. However, good may come from evil. This
Turon racket, may act as a wholesome tonic on those dis-
posed to go dredging-mad.

and-gold mines cannot be put on a paying basis without
big money.

Cobar Gold Mines, after spending nearly
£70,000 in plant, dam, &c., has at long last fairly got to

if not, another will soon go in.

Great Western, Cobar: “The cyanide plant
erected by this co. has proved unworkable and is now
idle.” Which is quite in keeping with most things on
record about this co. The Western’s cyanide plant was
only a tov, anyhow. The whole lot—which, by the
way, had to deal with very coppery dealings—might
have been dropped and lost, in one of the huge vats of
the Collar Gold Mines. Also—no account of how the
last Western crushing turned out has yet been printed.
* • * *
From Collar :—Occidental talks of increasing its
crushing power shortly. The new portions of the cyanide
plant have been put to work, so that the Occidental
should win twice as much gold as formerly.
Mt. Drysdale has made a 3d. call, to pay for its
cyanide plant. .It has yet to be proved that cyanidation
will be a success there. The Mount Drysdale tank does
not hold enough water to keep the plant going for a
couple of months, so that its only hope is to use the mine
water, and mine water is not always suitable for such
purposes.

The Bulletin office often has a lot of ore in
sight, and though the practice of sending it in has never
been encouraged, this paper receives too many requests
for gratuitous assays and opinions as to value and treat-
ment, of samples submitted. Arrangements have now
been made for testing, by assay and otherwise, samples of
ore, provided the sum of £1 is sent with each to cover
cost. Assays alone do not serve the miner’s purpose,
hence certificates supplied to Bulletin correspondents
will not, only give a statement of metallic contents, but
owners also will be advised by fin experienced, practical
metallurgist as to the best methods of treating the ore in
bulk, whether by wet or dry crushing and amalgamation,
smelting, c.vaniding, chlorinating, etc. Parcels should
not lie less than lib. nor more than 101 b.

Dear Bulletin.—Your correspondent “Gnome”
has not exaggerated in the least the condition of affairs
at Webb’s Mine, Gmmavilie. There is one aspect of the
case which he has not touched upon. Some 18 months
ago a number of Emmaville residents, being dissatisfied
with the old Medical Association (the one to which
“ Gnome ” refers) started a new fund. In spite of every
obstacle, the new association has thrived, and it even now
threatens to swamp its older rival. At Webb’s, as
elsewhere in the district, the new fund claims a
goodly number of supporters (or rather would-be sup-
porters), hut none dare join, as the ukase is plain enough
—“ Bay into the old fund or quit! ” Don’t you think it is
as great a piece of tyranny to compel men to support a
certain doctor when they prefer another as to enforce
their attendance on Sunday at a particu'ar religious
establishment alien to their own beliefs? —Pluto.
“Malle”: Rc Bulletin’s remarks (2/9,/’99) on
Woodlark Island. Writer has no interest therein, but
knows something of it. Lode is 15ft. wide, partly de-
composed, and by simply breaking it down and running
it through sluice-boxes the discoverers have won some
thousands of pounds' worth of gold during past two
years. The parcel spoken of as “ 14cwt. of concentrates
which returned lloz.,” were not concentrates at all, but
headings thrown from boxes. Also, 1 ton 18cwt. ore re-
cently sent to Aldershot, Q., returned OOoz. gold. Lode
is traceable for a considerable distance, and a Sydney co.
has secured 30 acres joining the prospector’s ; but as the
sensational returns come from the latter’s ground, the
Sydney people’s block may or may not be worthless. A
curiosity in this find is that coral comes right up to the
footwall of lode. Apropos, there are rumors current in
Sydney which it may he worth while for shareholders to
investigate concerning an alleged serious dispute over the
flotation of the Woodlark show.
The Anaconda, the world’s greatest copper-
mine, is said to be weakening ; it is so gigantic an affair
that the opening of many new rich mines would not com-
pensate for its falling-off. For some years its production
(350 tons of refined copper per day) represented one-fifth
of the world’s output.
• • • •
Another steadier for the copper - boomsters is
aluminium, which American electric-power people are in-
troducing in big quantities. One Chicago co. has given
orders for 150,0001 b. of feeder-wire ; and that would go as
far as three times the quantity of copper. Also, one
reason why Straits Settlements tin-producers are hanging
on to their stocks is the statement, widely published
locally, that a process is incubating for displacing copper
by tin in certain electrical appliances. How that is to
work, though, with tin at present prices isn't explained.

The Broken ITill Proprietary Co. are still im-
proving their system of ore dressing, and have decided to
erect a further number of “ Luhrig” Vanners, and shortly
74 of these machines will he at wprk in their mill. Before
adopting the “ Luhrig,” numerous tesrs were made with
other vanners, percussion tables, &c., but the “ Luhrig”
Tanner heat all competitors. An experimental plant is
erected near Melbourne for treating small parcels of from
two to five tons. Full particulars of “ Luhrig ” machinery
may he obtained from the general agents, W. and J.
Lempriere, Melbourne and Broken Hill.*

Mt. Garnet and Chillagoe Exploration Co. has
so far confined most of its explorations to London. And
it has succeeded this far —that a .1. Bull syndicate has
paid £1509 for a three months’ option from September 1,
this amount to he spent in development; but this is as to
a couple only of the co.’s eight or ten blocks. As to the
others, most of which are under exemption, some sort of
prospecting is promised out of the proceeds of calls.

The game of putting “ wild cats” together and
coming out under a new name is being vigorously played
in London to-day. The latest project of the sort con-
cerns some Charters Towers shows.
“ A Shareholder,” writing to Sydney D.T., falls
into the error of thinking' that Mt. Garnet Freehold Co.,
is trying to get ri hfs from Q. Parliament to build a rail-
way from the Chillagoe line to Mt. Garnet. It is the
Chillagoe co. which is pursuing the proposed concession.
But otherwise “ Shareholder” is all right when he says
that “ the building of the 38 to 40 miles of line from Mt.
Garnet to Wades’ will certainly provide a large additional
traffic for the Chillagoe line, hut it will provide that traffic
at the expense of the Mt. Garnet shareholders who will be
forced to pay freight on 30 additional and unnecessary
miles.” The route from Mareeha is the route, and as
Govt, proposes to construct the line to Atherton, the pro-
posal of the Chillagoe co. to build a roundabout branch
from their line is simply a very large job. Syndicate
railways are just the things for a country nnt to have, but
if a country must have syndicates two syndicates are
better than one. And the Chillagoe Railway and Mines
co. has bitten off all it can chew, ahvhow.
* * * •
Mt. Garnet Freehold’s first half-yearly report
shows a much more solid financial position than most
Chillagoe companies occupy. Cash at bankers on June 30
totalled £32,990; and £4904 of the fourth call was then
outstanding. Since that date “ nearly the whole of the
fourth call has been collected,” so that bank balance*
have been little affected by subsequent work. Though
the reports are copious there is still little by, which one
may judge the permanent value of tbe co.’s numerous
“shows.” No mine can be really tested until shafts or
winzes have been sunk ; tunnels and drives therefrom
are of much less value. The assay variations in the two
winze* sunk are therefore the most important part per-
haps of the report—the scores of other assays may be
passed. In No. 1 winze, at. 30ft. (at which point the first
samples were taken by the co.) the return was 7.8 per
cent, copper, and 6oz. 12dwt. silver. There was a steady
fall to 2.2 per cent, copper and 4oz. lfidwt. silver at 46ft. ;
but in the last fathom the return went up to 2.6 per cent,
copper, and 19oz. 12dwt. silver. In No. 2 winze the first
return was 7 per cent, copper and Boz. fidwt. silver; at
the bottom, 33ft., the stone {rives 5.1 per cent, copper and
13oz. sdwt. silver. In the latter winze, however, the
quality is exceedingly variable. Mine-manager Potter,
while admitting' that they “ cannot estimate with accu-
racy the quantity of ore available,” does not think he is
assuming too much in setting down 200,000 tons as the
approximate quantity.
Vic. can still provide some alluring specimen-
stone ; a couple of mates at Mansfield, in the Goulburn
Valley district, have just crushed 55 tons for 5330 z.

Australian Mines Development Co. is putting a
Bill through S.A. Parliament to legalise certain Northern
Territory concessions from Govt. It is alleged that large

An indication of the S.A. prospecting boom,
partly due to the firm copper market, partly to the Far
North goldfields : —Miner’s rights issued in ’95-6, 1173 ;
; ’97-8, 1322 ; '9S-9, 1864 ; July and August,

ascribed to acetylene for any length of time is 32 candles
per foot in a Ift. burner. If people make use of the
Welsbach mantle, acetylene cannot under any circum-
stances at present—it may almost be added! or in the
future —compete with coal-gas as an economical illumin-
ating agent. For domestic illumination acetylene is
superior—infinitely superior, it might be said—to every-
thing except the incandescent electric light and the
Welsbach gas mantle. —Yours truly, A. E. Hezlet.
They are humorists in Westralia. A deputa-
tion of people with low-grade mines lately asked Premier
Forrest to reduce the railway freights on poor ore,
alleging that some of it couldn’t stand the existing
charges. Forrest said that if lie did he would have to
raise the freights on rich ore to make up the loss, and the
deputation (which had no rich ore of its own) cheerfully
assented. Then the Government thought the matter out
and raised the freights on rich ore, but didn’t reduce
those on the other kind. And it says that the owners of
poor ore should be satisfied with the new arrangement,
because their product now goes so much more cheaply
than the rich stone.

The penny ’bus has come to Sydney, and
the owner of one loose brown can now ride all the
way from Redfern Station to Circular Quay.
From the tired person’s point of view, that is an
excellent innovation, but look at it from the other
fellow’s point <Jf view. The average ’bus carries
23 people inside and out. It is supposed to take
23 minutes to travel from Circular Quay to Red-
fern ; as a matter of fact, it takes longer on
account of the many stoppages and blocks in the
narrow, crowded thoroughfares, and it generally
occupies quite the full hour on the round trip.
Bet ween 8 and 9 a.m. and 5 and 6 p.m. the ’busses
do good business, but for the rest of the day they
seldom get anywhere near a full load. If they
had a full load every time they would take in
round figures 4s. per hour. But they don’t take
2s. And out of that is supposed to come driver’s
wages, feed, and wear and tear erf at least four
horses (even the hardest walloping can’t make the
same two skeletons run with the huge ’bus for 15
hours out of each 24), wear and tear of ’bus, in-
terest on cost, stable rent, groom’s wages, and
sundries. The horses are run off their legs, the
drivers work hideous hours for next to nothing a
week, and the whole business is a cheap penny
infamy which should be suppressed by law.

There is a strong spice of British hypo-
crisy in the Dreyfus indignation. “Such a thing
could not possibly occur in England,’’ say the
papers. But within the present generation the
Bradlaugh persecution was very much akin to it.
Bradlaugh for six years was harassed, brutally ill-
used, slandered, kept out of his legal rights,
financially ruined, and his strong frame shattered
till he died in his prime, just and only because his
beliefs were antagonistic to pious England. To
all intents and purposes Bradlaugh was perse-
cuted to death. And, oddly, it was from France
in those days that Bradlaugh received most sym-
pathy ; leading Frenchmen like Clemenceau and
Yves Guyot were among his staunchest friends.

A few years ago a spiritualistic leaflet was
published by a Melb. medium giving a description
of Heaven as dictated by a literary angel. In the
course of its narrative the ghostly one mentioned
that a relative who on earth had been named
Godfrey was known upon the golden shore as
yFrey,” the syllable “god” being considered
irreverent in such close proximity to the Supreme
Being It would therefore appear that English,
besides being the prospective language of all the
earth, is already the vernacular of the Better
Laud, and that to all intents and purposes the
Kingdom of Heaven is also under this muoh-
talked-of “British suzerainty.”

Melbourne Argus, referring to the Ther-
mopylae wreck, specifies 19 saloon-passengers by
name, then casually observes that “ there were
also 30 passengers in the steerage.” Further on
it gives at length the pedigrees and histories of
the two racehorses that were on board, sympa-
thetically relating that “ Chesney’s backers were
disappointed when he was withdrawn from his
er !Pf a gcmentb,” but it relieves public apprehension
with the information that “the horses were housed
in very comfortable boxes ”; and places upon
record the important historical fact that “the
horses were in charge of J. Bloomfield, who took
Patron, the Melbourne Cup winner, home.” The
account finishes-up with such car«o-details as
“ 2030 carcases mutton. ” And it’s quite surpris-
ing that “ also 30 steerage-passengers ” were given
precedence over “two valuable racehorses,” and
that the 30 unspecified live humans were men-
tioned before the 2030 defunct muttons.

A bright blue light was let in on the
“ housekeeper ” industry by the recent Adelaide
case in which a veteran of 78 was sued for breach
of promise to marry his housekeeper. Plaintiff
•admitted in cross-exam, that she had been married
twice already, that defendant had arranged to
marry her after only 4 days’acquaintance, and that
he stood in bodily fear of both her and his previous
housekeeper, who had turned up and was threat-
ening to make things lively all round. The poor
dear young thing (of 57) was non-suited.
‘ Did Lorimer know his dog was danger-
ous ? asked Justice a’Beekett of the jury in the
Melbourne dog-biting case of Chase v. Lorimer.
Little wonder his Honor bad afterwards to regard
the jury’s verdict as unsatisfactory. If a dog
bites a sheep tiie sheep-owner can claim and will
obtain damages without having to prove previous
bad character against the dog; but the dog law
practically allows the animal his first mouthful of
human flesh free—one of the absurdest laws of a
frequently absurd code.
A bit of bad luck lately happened to a
nice, elderly gentleman prominent in political
movements for the Encouragement of
Morality. Another elderly gentleman
conspicuous in the same' circles tells
the story against him, naught extenu-
ating. The latter, whose name is
not Brown, answered a late knock at
the door of his suburban villa and
found the former, whose name is not
Jones, standing on the mat. Jones
greeted Brown with a glare of sur-
prise, but stepped into the hall unin-
vited and began to divest himself of
nis overcoat. All he said was:
“Great Scott I Jones, who’d ever
have thought of meeting you here ! ”
Jones assumed the attitude of a
stern moralist and answered: “Is
there anything remarkable in that,
Mr. Brown? I live here—shifted
in yesterday morning.” Brown left
hurriedly, and Jones at onco insti.
tuted inquiries into the characters of
the former occupants of his house.
And—well, there you are.

times two or three times a week. Plaintiff replied
to this that she-occupied the room with her

and she denied all inferences. After this plain-
tiff’s lawyers withdrew from the case, and, with
some demur, she accepted a non-suit. As the

Tasmania’s licensing law-provision that no
female shall work in a bar after 10 p.m., had long
been a dead letter until recently the police were
taken with a moral spasm and got a lot of hotel-
keepers fined over the matter. Petitions are now
being signed asking Parliament to amend this
part of the Act, and it was thought that a petition
from the barmaids themselves (to be presented by
Gilmore, the ladies’ man of Tas. Parliament)
would carry much weight. So a meeting of the
profession was called in Launceston, but only one
solitary damsel attended. But why should any
barmaid wish to work after 10 p.m. ?

“ A Struggler ” to The Bulletin :
Nobody seems to have pointed-out what a serious evil
these charitable bazaars and fancy-fairs are to local busi-
ness people. Money and goods are continually being
appealed for by customers whom it is difficult to refuse,
and, in addition, our business suffers while the bazaar
booms. In this Melbourne suburb (admittedly not a pros-
perous one), we have just had the third dance within a
few weeks in aid of a Church-bazaar, the promoters of
which are making it a point to “cadge” everything in
connection therewith. The charity of religious bodies
appear to me to stop severely at home.
In Perth (W.A.), the W.C.T.U. runs what
it calls the Leisure Hour Club, into which a
billiard-table was some time back introduced.
But, as it hasn’t been paying, the Union
has all at once discovered that billiards is a
demoralising game, anyhow, and that the com-
mittee deserves severe censure for the innovation.

M.L. Chief Justice Stout has not made a
particularly bright start as a criminal Judge.
After declaring that he viewed offences against
the person as more heinous than those against
property, he sentenced a man convicted of a
murderous assault to 18 months’ gaol, while
another for stealing goods worth about .£2O got
four years’ quod. The latter, of course, was an
old offender; but a free-thinking Radical like
Stout should know better than punish a man for
his former bad character.

The other night the big Sydney firm of
Wood—it trades in wooden overcoats enter-
tained its employes at a smoke concert. The
affair was characterised by the overflowing animal
spirits and rollicking hilarity which ever dis-
tinguishes that light-hearted butterfly-in-black,
the undertaker, from his fellow mortal. A feature
of the evening’s entertainment was “a comio
singing competition among employes—the first
prize a whip.” A hearse-whip, no doubt —the
feverish hurry of the age having at length reached
that erstwhile easy-going humorist, the hearse-
driver. Some Bulletin verses for the next coffin-
makers’ spree :
At Melb. City Court, the other day, an all-
out blind old man (he claimed to be 66 and looked
it) was charged with begging. He said that he
had not long left the Benevolent Asylum, that he
lived by playing a concertina, and that the 265.
found on him represented six months’ savings.
The police-inspector’s suggestion that the ancient
should get another “show” made his Worship
(Mayor M‘Eacharn) snort. “ I don’t see why he
should get a show,” that awful person said.
" hy should he have gone to the asylum while
lie had money?” The old man pleaded that the
little fund was for providing an occasional butter
accompaniment to the regulation dry bread, and
craved for a little sympathy—which the well-fed
M'Eacharn promptly extended to him in the
shape of a month’s gaol. And The Bulletin
isn t sure that he didn’t almost deserve it for
expecting “sympathy” from a smug and
paunchy cit.

Fine feathers don’t always “fetch” woman.
The evidence in a recent Melb. divorce-case set
forth that petitioner’s husband, after a continued
course of blacking her eyes and dragging her
around by the hair, had vanished one morning
and remained untraced until information reached
petitioner that the missing one was living with
another woman in a distant town, and had airily
inquired of petitioner’s sister “how Julia” (the
petitioner) “ was getting on ? ” He “ rose ” upon
even this, however, later on, when—the provi-
sional spouse having died—he promptly proposed
to the original Lady of the Blows that'she should
come along and resume relations, setting out as
an inducement that the other woman had left
abundance of fine garments “just to your taste.”
The lady was not taking any, however, and sue-
ceeded in getting her divorce.

An Oamaru (M.L.) beak has shed a ray of
joy on the. path of the “prohibited” drunk by
deciding that a railuayrefresliment-room is not
a licensed house “within the meaning of the
Act.” So another law goes to pieces through
the inveterate legal habit of deciding that
wherever there is room lor doubt it shall
always be assumed that the framers of the
law meant the most unlikely thing possible.
And pending repairs to the statute, that
customary official notification that is hung
up all over the average Maoriland pub.,
“ You are warned not to supply any drink
to John Smith,” will be of 'little effect
wherever a railway refreshment-room is
available. For the prohibited Smith can
drink himself blind there, and then get

The recent flogging of two prisoners in
Bathurst gaol for alleged insubordination was
surrounded with such secresy that only a few
even of the officials knew when it took place.
Such childish mystery-mongering would be absurd
if it were not a part of the iniquitous system by
which a man already in gaol for one offence can
be secretly arraigned fer another, and brutally
punished upon the order of an irresponsible
official. No community of such barbarous methods
has any business with the term “civilised.”

gaol. The prisoner exclaimed against the mode of
trial which adjudged his flogging. Offences
against gaol discipline are tried by what is really
a secret tribunal, and secret tribunals for the
punishment of offences in gaol or out are among
the curses of civilisation.

Chinese humor. A Sydney trade-sign
SOON LEE,
FEDERATED AUSTRALIA
LAUNDRY.
Quinn, M.L.A. for a
Sydney constituency, pro-
poses the opening up of an-
other crooked street to partly
relieve the immense tratfio
in Oxford-street (practically
the only outlet eastward
from Sydney, for the early
fathers hadn’t sense enough
to cut off the sudden knob at
the top of William-street,
and the said knob makes
heavy traffic impossible).
There is also talk about the
need for a new outlet south-
ward ; all the traffic that way
is oompressed into George-
street, and it and Oxford-
street are going to be two
death-traps. But Sydney is
past repairing by any piece-
meal process of opening an-
other crooked street here and
another corkscrew lane there.
It wants to be all laid out
afresh, and rebuilt as Paris
was when Napoleon the Less
tackled the work. He was
a very small Napoleon, but,
if he were still alive, he
would make a very big and
glorious Mayor of Sydney,
if Sydney only had him.

The Bulletin s exposure of the conspiracy
of silence in barrister Gregory’s case seems to have
shamed Melb. Age and Argus into mentioning
last week “an application by an inmate of Kevv
Lunatic Asylum for his release from confinement.”
Neither of these “ respectable ” journals brea'. lied
a whisper as to the name, legal position, or particu-
lar delusions of the lunatic, but they were careful
to explain that Judge Hodges had been convinced
of his insanity. Had his Honor’s decision been
favorable to poor Gregory it would probably have
been kept as dark as the previous proceedings in
this case. All the Vic. Supreme Court Judges
have now considered Gregory in their official
capacities (in their private capacities they were
always well acquainted with his history) and none
of them can find him other than insane. Gregory
talks Law with more than ordinary cleverness
and soundness of reasoning, but he needs very
.ittle inducement to betray his monomania
• • * *
Just when a Melb. court was deciding fine
points in the Gregory lunacy case, a Bendigo P.Mu
was ordering a worse maniac to 18 months’gaol',
with an intimation that the court was exceedingly
lenient in not adding a whipping. The Bendigo
prisoner had at least twice before, during the last
six years, been sentenced to long terms for pre-

eisely the same sort of indecency ; but no order
for special (or even ordinary) medical examination
seems to have been made in his case. The best
that the intelligent law can do for him is to gaol
him and flog him; and as likely as not it will
presently have the job of hanging him, and smug
newspapers will piously record what a detestable
criminal he was.

“ The Christian rule in regard to wages or

day, “is the fair current market-value as regu-
lated by the ordinary supply and demand.” Is

and-demand rule to his own fat salary? How
many poor devils of incumbents and cur tes would
be glad to do twice his work for half his pay?

Chief-Justice Darley, endeavoring to quash
a case in which a R.C. plaintiff applied for
damages against his R.C. parish-priest, for slander
and assault, said from the bench that a law-court
was not the place for trying such charges. His
Honor meant, of course, a secular law-court. In
that dictum, he is quite in accord with R.C.
canonical law. Time was when no such action
dare go before a lay tribunal. If it did, plaintiff,

During that recent London wife-desertion
hearing against one M’Gregor, complainant’s
lawyer said that—
The representative of the Ajjent-General of Victoria in
Loudon had informed him that while it was true that a
Bill was introduced into the Vic. Parliament annulling
the marriages solemnised by the Rev. Nathanial Kins-
man, yet for the sake of public policy such marriages
were looked upon as valid.
It would be interesting to know what “represen-
tative” of the Vic. A.gent-G- meral made that
absurd statement. Whatever may be thought
otherwise of Kinsman’s marriages, they are un-
questionably valid. The trouble in the case was
that plaintiff had no proper proof of her marriage.

Education-Minister Butler got up in S.A.
Assembly the other day to give some information
about wine-growing. Somehow or other he got
his figures mixed, and what ought to have been
gallons became acres, and a confused House was
soon listening to statistics showing that S.A. had
grown =£48,000 gallons 2s. Gd. worth of vines in
383 years at a cost of three acres per gal. The
abstemious Premier Kingston then started to
audit his colleague’s figures, but got mixed up be-
tween the light and dark wines, and the only con-
clusion possible was that S.A. has been growing
vines for 40 years when soda and brandy would
have been more profitable. By the time the dis-
cussion had finished the House’s stock inebriate,
who has been going square for over a month, had
become paralytic on ginger ale and had to be
hung out to dry.

In a recent Melbourne wife-desertion case,

“You admit having committed adultery with
Blank?” “Yes, sir.” “ Have you misconducted
yourself with a man named Dash ? ” “ Yes,
sir.” “Did your husband catch a man in the
house with you one night after the alleged deser-
tion, and give him a severe battering? ” “ Yes,
sir.” The best thing this candid young person
can do is to get a new husband and drop the
subject.

The struggle for a crust. “ Holdar M.” :
Re Sydney boarding-houses. I lately received a
hatful of replies to an advt. for bachelor accommo-
dation—some of ’em distinctly inviting. One
obviously illiterate lady wrote to the effect that
she was a young, blithesome widow as per en-
closed photo (in evening dress) and would be glad
if advertiser would call and confer. Had in the
house only her one child and an elderly servant,
so that advertiser could have her undivided
attention. Another replier said she kept an
accomplished lady-help who would gratuitously
teach the gentleman musio and singing. Others
offered tuition in French, the violin, dancing,
shorthand (and in one instance in manicurin')) as
incentives to share their homes at an average rate
of £1 per week.

“A.C.”: Another development of the
mixed-marriage. A R.C. priest told writer that
the wife (C. of E.) periodically invited him to

was so good,” she said, “ for some time after-
wards.”

The hard-headed Aberdeen court took a
calm, reasonable view of the Cemetery Desecra-
tion case, in which a chief sexton was found
guilty of “ exhuming corpses on the night after
burial, and huddling them with gross indignity
into pits dug in the walks of the cemetery, or
burning them in the tool-house.” Allowing for
the fact that a sexton’s business destroys all his
sentimental respect for corpses, and that what
seems “ horrible ” to human vanity is not horrible
to a cemetery official, the Scotch tribunal let this
shocking materialist off with three months’ im-
prisonment, After all, he was a public benefactor,
only the public don’t know it. He has brought
graveyard-mourning into ridicule, and suggested
the sanitary advantages of cremation in a tool-
house.

After this, it is time to let the hairy-man
discussion slide. Writes “ Ben Sun ”: —
“Puyakka" (8., 9 9’99) asserts (1) that hair isn’t an
indication of strength ; and (2) that the hail-appreciating
female is a retrogression. As for the first, the present
writer “ wallops out a crust ” amongst, those with whom
strength is absolutely necessary—not the cultivated
strength of the athlete, but the staying power of the
navvy, the wood-splitter, or the quarryman, and he
would back the stamina of the hirsute fellow every time,
even if the great preponderance of such in those callings
did not go far to establish his physical superiority.
As to the second point, if, as the exponents of
evolution assert, its trend is mainly forwards, and if
“Puyakka’s” argument is logical the “relative fre-
quency” of the hirsute homo is entirely inexplicable.
Again—“ The average healthy woman possesses a rooted
dislike to the sight of abnormally hairy limbs or
chest.” Dogmatic—but fallacious in crediting woman
with an artistic delicacy of taste which she doesn’t
possess, and because it doesn’t take into account the
demonstrated attraction of opposites. As for the racial
theory, its value depends on the extent of its possible
application. The African pigmy’s intellect is as yet a
practically unknown quantity, and his skin-growth is, in
any case, more wool than hair. Moreover, the absurdity
of saying that the Montenegrin is “ below the Northern
Chinaman in intellect and physique” is probably due to
the fact that in the Levant people only meet with the
Montenegrin debased to the level of his rascally sur
roundings.

for all the other official correspondence, and have not
only ourselves to bu.v the requisite large envelopes, but
also to stamp them like private correspondence. In the

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, September 19, 1899.
My Dear Mtee, —
Blue tickets and white tickets again at Lord
Beauchamp’s second ball. But people had grown
used to the seidlitz-powder entertainments, and
the fizz was much more subdued. About 450
guests assembled. This ball differed from the
first in several ways. In the first place, a list of
those who were not there would not be quite so
interesting as a similar list about the first hop, for
everybody seemed to be present. There were few
glaring omissions noticeable to anyone there,
whatever people who stayed away might have ob-
served. After seeing the garden-party and the
two balls, it seems that the invitations were not as
frightfully far-fetched as i>eople said, but the
usual Govt. House men were very few and far
between at both balls.
Certainly, things are not as they used to be at
Govt. House. Never before in its chequered
career (not for a long, long, quite-forgotten time,
anyway) has Sydney Society been watched and
shadowed, and asked to stand back, and not go
there, and not to enter by that door, and—in a
whisper this last—not to take two turns at the
Cattles cn Cronstadt.
The wounds of one well-known citizen are un-
speakably painful. He took in to supper a lady
who asked him presently to go and find her
daughter, a debutante, and bring her in also. He
went out of the supper-room, found the debutante,
and was returning with her on his arm when an
Aide, stationed outside the supper-room, swooped
down on him. “Pardon me, you have been in
before ! ”
If you are mathematician enough to add that to
Birthstains, you will find the result is almost im-
possible.
Society was horribly surprised and upset
and insulted and yet what happened at
the swagger polo-tea that very afternoon ?
The guests swarmed the tea-tables, rushed
the strawljerrios and cream, demolished ices,
cakes, and tea, and reduced the tables to
desolation. The hostesses, Mrs. W. B. Mitchell
and Mrs. Lassetter, hadn't thought it necessary to
keep guard over the food, and were watching to
receive His Ex. and party. At 4 o’clock arrived on
the scene the Gov. and the Admiral. They were led
into the tea-room where the vulgah crowd was just
completing its work of demolition and—well,
luckily they could not get near the tables. His
Ex.’s eye has been cultivated for ruins, but it was
a sickly moment for the hostesses. On the even-
ing of that same auspicious day, Govt. House is
charged with keeping watch over its feed—and no
wonder. If all these things are known in Heaven,
and made manifest among the angels, there isn’t
much inducement to be good and get there when
you die.
Gove. House ball-room has become a thing of
beauty, with its testhetic music balcony and soft,
yellow pairing. Under the balcony, along the
wall, runs a divan where Potts Point tries hard to
take its seat. The aides were very busy here,
asking ]>eople to move aside, and stand out of
somebody’s superior light. It seems a pretentious
and unnecessary thing to do, but if there’s a pre-
cedent for it at the Court of Her Gracious, let us
bow and be thankful we are being taught some-
thing that would never have occurred to our
natural understanding.
People are saying oracularly “Something will
happen.” Nobody knows definitely what the
nature of that something will be. Possibly, the
ruffles will smooth themselves out, but at present
everyone is busy writing a letter to His Ex. telling
him straight. And so Society continues to heave,
but His Ex. continues to go blandly on in his own
way. His theory of inviting people is sweetly
erratic, quite in keeping with a “ little Billee.” It
is to gather into Govt. House people who do some-
thing for others. Knowing this, it is easy to see
how the invitation lists have become so disorgan-
ised. How can a new Gov. make accurate picks
at the people who do things for others? He can-
not have an intimate knowledge of the thousands
of names in his visiting-book. He goes by what
he sees—by the'obvious. The result is that H.E.
invites broadcast the noble army of people who do
things for other people in a public and obvious
and unmistakable way, while Charity that begins
at home stays there.
The second ball was less exclusive than the
first, and more gorgeously frocked. The Some-
bodies and the Nobodies—these are the people
who need not trouble to be socially dressed.
But the In Betweens have to depend on their
outer garments, and where the In Betweens are,
there are the gowns that glitter. Lady Mary’s
ball-dress was built up of string-colored lace over
orange silk. Its quietness was its particular
feature. Lady Brassey was in grey silk trimmed
with steel embroidery, a cerise waistbeltancl heaps
of diamonds. Mrs. Brough, who arrived after
“Algy,” was in her favorite black, with pink
roses round the corsage. Mrs. Burdekin wore
white satin and diamonds. Mrs. Willie Mitchell
aired a glittering blue-grey net smothered in (lull
silver sequins, and carried a huge bouquet of pink
roses. Mrs. Tom Hughes was in a lovely white
and silver net, with touches of turquoise blue
about it. Miss Wade Brown sorted a simple,
fetching little cream breton net dress with elbow
sleeves. Miss V'iolet Somerset kept up the house-
party’s reputation for quiet frocking in a simple
black satin with white chiffon sleeves.
And, speaking of Biddies, what do you think of
the coming V.R. ball ? Tradespeople and domes-
tics. The cruellest cut that ever fell on Potts
Point’s ’aughty shoulders is that the tickets for the
pint-o’-prawns-rnan and the mangling lady are
worded just like society’s own invites.
Rumored—but it can’t, it really can’t, lie true—
that a very large, portentous, swagger, waxed and
waisteoated gentleman from a very fashionable
suburb, whose name is identical with a place where
they sell crockery, has been graciously invited to
the tradesman’s ball.
For my part, I refuse to believe in anything so
rankly blasphemous. But one can’t help feeling
with the wounded Darling Pointers who have not
been asked to Govt. House at all, and whose
coachman parades “The Aide de Camp, etc., of
Mr. Jeames Sloggins ” over the kitchen mantel-
piece. “ What, not going to Guv’ment ’Ouse,
mum ? Never mind, me and Mariar’il tell you all
about it.”
Saturday’s Randvvick was at the mercy of dust
and warm winds, and of a badly-managed tea-
room, where the meaning of tips they did not, or
would not, understand. Men complained that
their coin was taken and their wants ignored in
the most startling way. The supply of waitresses
was absurdly inadequate, and infuriated husbands
and fathers rushed the counters, and seized what-
ever they could get. Hopes have been held out
for a long time of new arrangements, when all the
sandwiches would be buttered, and everybody’s
sandwich would contain more than one lonely
clump of fat, but the hope is only a hope still.
The only alteration I saw was that the teacups
have been reduced in thickness from an inch to
three-fourths of an inch.
A whirl of drapery met the eye on the lawn.
Everything was light, in color and in texture.
Parasols were masses of chiffon frills, or of plain
turquoise or pink silk. These plain parasols are
much sought after,- and are often employed to
strike the one note of color. Tulle was on all the
hats. The little hats were made of tulle, the big
hats had fluttering tulle strings. There was
plenty of opportunity to observe that thesestrings
didn t suit everybody. A large face looks doubly
large with the strings to outline it. A thin face
becomes longer and thinner, and drabber, and
more like a face in a tablespoon if you tie it round
with tulle. The face for strings is a shortish,
roundish, pink and white face that is not over-
burdened with chin, and if there’s a dimple,
so much the better for the strings and everybody.
A terrible vision is a long, bony chin outside an
airy tulle bow. It is also trying to look on
diaphanous strings winding their way between
the fourth and fifth chins of a woman of forty.
In styles of frocks, polonaises led by a neck ; the
lace polonaise over silk frills, or—as in Mrs.
Lassetter’s case—the silk polonaise over a guipure
underskirt. Black and white was a good deal
worn, but chiefly in gauzy things, like black
mousseline-de-soie and black val lace. Mrs. Harry
Leyien and Mrs. Tom Watson both aired filmy
white and black muslins. Nothing looked better
than the flowered muslins with heaps of lace,
made apart from the linings, so that their airy
texture could be preserved. The bride, Miss
Henrietta Watson, who was accompanied by her
husband, was in one of these muslin gowns, a
simple little mauve and white, with a violet waist-
band, and a floppy black leghorn hat with feathers.
You have heard, of course, that Miss Watson
isn’t Miss Watson any longer. She was married
very quietly in Sydney, recently, to Mr. Rad-
cliffe, a wealthy young Englishman. Rose Mus-
grove was the only one in the secret. Mr. Rad cliff e
accompanied his bride to the races on Saturday,
and was seen to be a tall, dark young man with
a black moustache and eyeglasses.
Mrs. Brough was there, simply dressed in a red
hat and black coat and a skirt with white revers.
It is one of Mrs. Brough’s charms that she never
parades the theatrical in her out-door dressing.
Mrs. W. B. Mitchell wore her pink-rose toque
again with a white lace frock, transparent at the
neck and sleeves. Lady Brassey was in a cigar-
brown costume, with a black-and-white toque
brightened with red roses. Lady Mary wore a
simple apple-green muslin trimmed with much
lace. The Melbourne visitors were less conspicu-
ous in their dressing than on Derby-day. Mrs.
Pakenham was in a pink silk flounced with real
lace. Mrs. George Chirnside, in grey voile. Miss
Carter, in a white serge Eton costume, braided in
black, and a large black hat trimmed with red
roses. A tall, pretty Sydney girl wore a mauve
frock covered all over with coarse lace, and a
little hat made of wheat-ears. Miss Slattery
aired a light tan voile and a blue tulle toque with
long white feathers. Another pretty voile frock
was worn by Miss Dinah Cooper—grey, topped
with a little white tulle head-gear, and sweeping
pale-blue feathers.
People on the look-out for omens took their tip
from the band for the last race. Scotch airs.
“Auld Lang Syne” looked the Scottiest thing
going; and after that, “Caledonia.” Backers
rushed for both of these. Neither of them got in ;
but the omen might have been an omen all the
same. The winning horse was Glenroy.
The Mayoral “At Home’’given to H.E. and
the Admiral drew a large crowd to the Town Hall
on Monday. The Mayoress is a cheery, kind-
hearted being, who can beam on fifteen hundred
people with absolute naturalness, and if the Mayor
doesn’t find it as easy to cast off smiles nobody
expects a Mayor to be always dimpling. The
party went off crisply. The hostess received in
black net, spangled in turquoise blue, and the
host wore black and ermine. The hall was beauti-
fully fixed up with big palms and long chains of
greenery. These latter enclosed a space in the
middle of the hall, where the distinguished guests
were kept on view for a little. By the way,
why were 1500 people asked to meet the
Admiral, whom we always have with us? In
order of land precedence, the benign Chief
Justice, who doesn’t look quite like his 0!)
years, ought to have been next on the list after
11.10. But people didn't mind whom they were
asked to meet, and nobody met them who hadn’t
done it before, so the matter isn’t a burning one.
Quite a relief to touch on a topic nowadays that
isn’tscorchful. Lady Mary wore laceover anorange
robe, and Mrs. Admiral was in grey. Mr. and
Mrs. Jack Want were much focussed ; Mrs. Want
clothed her tall, dashing figure in black satin,
carried a pink bouquet, and the best coiffure seen
formany a day on any female head related to
things political. Mrs. George Reid was in white
chiffon and silk, with a wreath of pink roses in her
golden hair. One of the new Ministry caused
faint amusement by his carefully-considered way
of being always everywhere within view, and the
wife of another was mysteriously unable to recog-
nise her dear friend the greengrocer's lady. On
the whole, the “ At Home ” was the most success-
ful Mayoral function to date.
Mrs. Stoddard has been working hard at her
water-color portrait of Lady Mary. In order to
give her every opportunity of making a good
thing of it, Mrs. Stoddard was invited up to the
Sutton Forest residence where she put in a couple
of quiet weeks with the V.R. party. The portrait
will be finished just in time. Lady Mary, Lady
Bertha, Dowager Raglan, and Miss Somerset ail
depart next Saturday. His Kx. wisely keeps
dark his intentions as to how his future parties
will be hostessed, but the Chief Justicess will
probably be called in to fill the gap.
Sad to think that the Broughs’ last nights are
drawing nigh, and the time is coming when there
will be no Liars, no Algies, none of these nice,
well-groomed people saying smart things in pretty
drawing-rooms that have been livening up the life
of the play-goer all the past winter. Society paid
its biggest tribute to the popular co. last Satur-
day at “The Village Priest.” Every box was
turned into a side - show of bare arms and
glittering raiment. Thecircle wasabrilliant massof
jewelsand frocks and flowers. Thedress-sialls flowed
far back over the ordinary unreserved seats. Mel-
bourne and Sydney mingled their pathetic expres-
sions together—Chirnsides, Maddens, Osbornes,
Carters, Burflekins, Mitchells, Levys. Rumor
said that several of these were glad of an author-
ised opportunity to look sad after their adventures
with the “bookies,” and the faithlessness of
“ Bobby ” and “ Gladdy.”
The Society of Artists held its conversazione
on Saturday night at its show-rooms, and a
crowd of principally youthful people turned up in
evening dress and otherwise. There is not much
difference between one conversazione and another,
and this one was as pleasantly like any other as
the other one. _ The tall young lady artist with
white nasturtium decorations is generally re-
garded as lucky in having sold her two exhibited
pictures, and been blessed with orders for two
more. Perhaps the feature of the evening was
the number of pretty girls present in the flesh and
evening dress, whose portraits hung about tho
walls and made the real things look three shades
better.
At present tho concerts hanging over Sydney
are twelve in number. Miss Karelin, Miss Cook,
Miss Grace Fletcher. Miss Faniiy Bauer. Madame
Kellerman, Mr. Sydney lloljon, Signor Vit-
torini, and five others are going to warble, fiddle,
or “ pliay the piatmo.” By this time next week
Miss Narelle’s will be over, but there will pro-
bably be another dozen hatched.
Writes my Melbourne corresi>ondent: —
“Sir Charles Holled-Smith, the Vic. military
commandant, is not at all inclined to return to
England at the end of the term of his present en-
gagement, a few months hence. He has been very
popular with the military folks, and he and Ins
buxom wife have been great social successes.
Therefore. Premier Turner is being pressed to re-
new tho engagement. But he is dead against
doing so in view of Federation. If Holled-Smith
returns to England, lie will probably be at once
put on half-pay as a retired Major-General, and
have to dawdle out the rest of liis days at some
semi-fashionable watering-]dace, unless (and it is
not likely) he could secure the Australian Federal
command. It was he—as Steevens points out—
who rendered possible Kitchener’s work in the
Soudan, and lie looks, as well as is, a perfect
soldier. But Turner wants to save the salary.
“When the first Baronet Clarke died, ho left
the huge barrack-like family mansion in E. Melb.
to his willow, while the country-seat and estates
went to his son. It is now stated in social circles
likely to be well-informed that widow Clarke is
going to sell the place, and that it will be obtained
by a syndicate; and turned into a big fashionable
hotel. The on dil is the more probable in that the
Clarkes raised no opposition to the Collmgwood
railway, though a station is to be raised imme-
diately opposite the mansion. This would spoil
the place as a private residence, partly blocking
out the view across Richmond reserve 'to the
Yarra and Botanical Gardens, but would add
immensely to its value as a hotel site. Moreover,
the palace would need few alterations for the pur-
pose. There is immense bedroom accommodation
upstairs, and the downstairs rooms are large and
fine. The Cliveden Hotel will probably be the
great swagger Melbourne hotel of the future.
“Roller-skating is to the fore again! Mrs.
Harper’s handsome only daughter is getting up
a rinking-club at Toorak, with Mr. McNuhol
Turner as secretary. The Harper clan has just
lost its chief by the death of Robert Harper,
senior (father of the four Harper brethren), a tali’
stalwart Scot, aged {ll. Old Mrs. Harper died a
few months back.
“ Presbyterian parson Dixon, of Warmambool
(Vic.), against whom a writ has been issued for
breach-o f - prom i se, is as unlike ono’s conception of
a gay deceiver as Mr. Pickwick himself. A
fastidious, scholarly, middle-aged bachelor, always
under the wing of his mother and sisters till lately,
when the former died and the latter took to
matrimony. Mr. Dixon, who has lived in China,
tells a story of tho modest Koreans. It was hot
weather, and tho sailors on an English yacht went
in for a swim alongside, whereiqion the whole
Korean village put up its shutters in horror, and
when the culprits had ceased their atrocities the
leading ofiieials came off in a boat, with their eyes
handmjed , to make a formal complaint.
“ Father Isaac Moore, the head of the Jesuits
in Melbourne, died last week in surgeon
Fitzgerald's private hospital. Tho first edition of
the A nous contained a paragraph stating that he
was so much better that lie would shortly leave
the hospital, but a later edition contained news of
his death. lie was 70 years of age, but still up-
held his reputation as one of the foremost
preachers in Melbourne, though he had aged
much during the last two years. Gentle and
tolerant as he was on many subjects, ho grew per-
fectly rampant on the subject of women’s tongues,
and would rail at his congregation in no measured
terms on the ‘unruly member’ which is ‘full of
deadly poison.’ But, all the same, the women
respected and obeyed him, even while they feared,
lie was a clever, well-read, and thoroughly able
man, and will be much missed in Melbourne.
“ Amy Castles and her aunt, so they say, pant
for Paris and quiet study. When it comes to the
point, poor M iss Bendigo, dried into a small brown
shrimp with travel and excitement, will probably
jib at steady grind after recent delirium. At the
Castles’ concerts the best part of the show was a
peep behind the scenes. After each song, Amy
wept on the bosoms of the queerest crowd of
Paddies extant. When she took her presentation
gewgaw to his Reverence to be blessed, the good
man did his duty with the air of a “ heavy father, ’’
and then indulgently beckoned forward a broth
of a bhoy to clasp the sanctified bracelet on the
bridling owner’s wrist. Those “cruel” press
accounts of the farewell Castles’ sing-song set
the criticised colleen and her confidantes “keen-
ing” like so many banshees, while their gintlemen-
friends twirled their shticks and trod on the tails
of imaginary journalistic coats. Another disap-
pointment for the clan was Melbourne's cold re-
ception of little Dolly. Earlier in the boom Amy
told people that she herself was anxious to get
away to Europe, so as to leave the coast clear for
her sister.
“‘Geisha’ Florence Perry is back from her
wanderings a shade tougher and more travel-worn
than she went, having annexed a trifle more
assurance by the way, in exchange for a layer of
her old demure daintiness. Dorothy Vane, .as the
masquerading British Miss, has altered her auction
plumage. She is now knocked-down cheap with
so much scarlet in her haberdashery and crimp in
her hair that the artless little English girl
makes the Jappies brought up to the tea-
house trade look callow and coy by com
parison. Nothing unlikely in this ! We all know
the real-life saint ‘whose strength is as the
strength of ten because her heart is pure’ and who
plays-up in consequence to an extent denied the
alleged sinner. Picture Mrs. Grundy’s fury, if
the Tottie class publicly ventured upon kitchen
lancers, skipping matches, cherry-picking capers—
those innocent diversions of the local naicest !
And poor Flossie’s knuckles would be rapped even
harder if, taking her social cue from the ‘Salt of
the Earth,’ she kissed in the open air like Sunday-
school picnickers, or ostentatiously paired off with
John Chinaman, after the manner of mission-
seraphim !
“As lady-killers, Pauli and Kenningham would
be twice as deadly, if only half as healthy. The
former can scarcely see out of his eyes, whilst
Pother, overflowing a uniform presumably built for
some Slim-.Jin. predecessor, is handicapped by a
surplus of undraped beefy wrist and fist.
“ Mdllc. Trebelli grows into the good graces of
hearers. Her voice, not of sensational volume,
has tones suggestive of elfin horns, silver bells, an-
gelic carols, and other sounds peculiar to dream-
land. lake her singing, her appearance is gradual
in its charm. At the first glance one thinks “She
looks older and staider to-night. Dress too sub-
dued ! ” Then, by degrees, the pale yellow bro-
cade with its lace chemisette, treble chain of big
cool pearls across the bodice-front, and sprinkle
of diamonds, gets to seem an ideal toilette for a
warm evening.
“ When barrister J. B. Gregory (now of Kew
Asylum) lectured to the law-students on Law and
Property he indulged in a yearly joke. ‘Gentle-
men, needless to - remark, there are no manors in
Australia.’ Probably much learning hath made
Gregory mad. Euclid, for instance, he studied in
the original Greek, disdaining the ordinary trans-
lated version.
“A prominent Austral Salonist lost her purse.
She made a fuss about it, and said she wasn’t
sure where she lost it, but she missed it when she
got to the Salon. But, suspecting theft, she
advertised thus:—
TX7 11.1, Person seen picking up Purse yesterday, at
Austral Salon, please return to' Attendant,
Salon ?
In a man’s club, a person who inserted such an
adyt. reflecting on the whole institution, would
be ignominiousiy expelled.
“That adyt. recalls the notification posted by
a member in a certain fashionable English men’s
club:— ‘ Iho nobleman who stole my pipe will
kindly return it to the steward, to save
trouble.’ The club arose in indignation, and the
offending member was haled beforo the committee.
‘Why had he imputed theft to some noble mem-
ber?’ ‘Well,’he explained, ‘the rules say that
this club is for noblemen and gentlemen. The
man who stole that pipe must be a nobleman —he
is no gentleman.’

Weather-prophet Wragge was 47 years

Reid’s ; E. W. O’Sullivan, of Freeman’s Journal,

“The Hard-Headers” should fit Lyne’s

Herr Borchgrevink’s great expectations in

L. A. Wells, who led the unfortunate
“Calvert ” exploring party in N.W. Westralia, is
now working for the S.A. Lands Dept, in the Far
North valuing pastoral improvements and report-
ing on new gold-finds.
The story that the new N.S.W. Premier
was once a policeman has no foundation, except
that when he was a Tas. municipal official he
more or less controlled the local police. Mr.
Lyne was never in the police-force.
The N.S.W. portfolio of Justice has again
oscillated to a layman, W. H. Wood. Gould
(lawyer), Lee (layman), Hughes (lawyer), Wood
(layman). But Wood, it is circulated, studied law
a little, and is at present reading for the Bar.
The diploma of Dr. Edward Boot, who
lately died at Moruya (N.S.W.), is dated 1837.
The doctor was 86 years old, and had practised at
Moruya for 50 years. The diploma of Dr. Crooke,
of Darlinghurst, aged 86 and still in active prac-
tice, is dated 1838.
Since Archibald Micliie s death the oldest
knighthood in Victoria (if not in Australia! is
Graham Berry’s, date 1886. All the other Vic-
torian knighthoods belong to the ’9o’s, with the
exception of Binjv Benjy and Mat Davies, who
got their gauds in ’B9.
Bushranger Frank Gardiner’s father still
lives in Switzerland. The belief current at the
time the amiable highwayman was sentenced was
that Gardiner was not his real name. His release,
by hocus-pocus process—a release which caused
the downfall of the then Ministry—was also attri-
buted to the exercise of the influence of an influen-
tial relative of the bailer-up. The person desig-
nated as Franks father is a pensioned British
military officer.
“ Old Jack :
The items (B. 15/7/’99)
about people’s dodges
to oil their consciences
and escape perjury,
recall Crossley, the
old-time convict at-
torney. Crossley was
transported for
forgery—placed a fly
in a dead man’s mouth
and then, with a pen
in the corpse’s hand,
signed a will in his
(Crossley’s) favor.
Then, when the thing
ivas contested, C. and
h isconfederates swore
that, when supposed
testator signed,
“ there was life (the
fly’s) in him.” How-
ever, the coup didn’t
“comeoff”and Cross-
ley “came out.” At
Botany Bay he
speedily got going
again as a shark and
made coin, but Judge
Bent wouldn’t allow
him to plead in his
court; which led to
war between the
Judge Advocate and
the Emancipists’ Pro-
tector, and Bent was
worsted. Crossley
died from effect of
fishbone’s lodgement
in his throat. Which,
in view of the fly fake-
ment, was, in some
sort, “poetic jus-
tice.”
A S.A. C. of E. parson, C. E. Doudney,
has about made a record—been to England and
back, married a wife (of the family of ex-Gov.
Gawler, by the way), and scored a “possible” at
the annual rifle matches in Adelaide, all inside
five months. Mr. Doudney was one of the S.A.
representatives at last National rifle meeting in
Sydney, but shot without luck.
There are aspects of Maoriland Premier
Seddon that suggest Haroun Al Raschid. Com-
plaint having been made in Parliament that un-
married men had been refused employment on
Govt, co-operative works, Richard Bun Tuck
announced that every bachelor over 25 who would
promise to marry within six months of getting
work would be given a steady job by the State.
A sprig of English nobility, who has seen
hard times in Australia, relates, in a meditative
way, that he only went bailiffing once. “It
was for rent, and when I got to the house,
the old woman told me to sit down, as the
old man wouldn’t be in for a few minutes.
I sat down. When the old man came along
I told him my business, but
he only smiled, and asked me
if I had lunched yet, don-
oherknow. Told him, yes.
Then I helped him to take
out his horse and put the
cart in the shed, and he
kept smiling all the time.
• Could I turn a grind-
stone ? ’ ‘ Oh, yes !’and I
turned it, and he held the
axe to it. Said I turned
splendid, and still the same
smile. After about ten
minutes he stopped, and
asked me to feel the edge
of the axe. It was like
a razor. ‘Going wood-
chopping ? ’ I asked. ‘ No,’
he said, smiling worse’n
ever, and flourishing the
axe round his head. ‘ I’m
goin’ bailiff-choppin’ !’—
and he makes a rush at
me. I was over that fence
quick, and found out after-
wards that the man spent
more of his time inside a
lunatic asylum than out-
side. I reckon that was a
tight place, because when
the police went for him
next day he had his wife
up the chimney and
was lighting a fire to
smoke her out.”
“P.”: Knew something
of the Maoriland “ poet ” Wills (a
bootmaker, by the way), lately men-
tioned in Bulletin. An edition de
luxe of his verse was published 15
years ago by Henry Brett, of Auck-
land —a collection of easy rhymes
possessing very little merit. He
was an omnivorous reader, and a very Parkes
for aitchlessness, but a merry companion. In
Hori Grey he had a sympathetic patron.
He acted as Otahuhu correspondent for
Auckland Star, and on one occasion
referred to the “farming gentry” as
attending a meeting of the Pakuranga
hounds. Sturdy old John Blackman,
alluding to this, said: “Wills, if
you love me, never use ‘gentry’
again. I came 16,000 miles to get
out of reach of the sound of that
abominable word.”
Reid and Wise go to no trouble or expense
in hiding their mutual animosity. When the new
N.S.W. Attorney-General took over his depart-
ment he had perforce to introduce himself, stray-
ing in for all the world like a casual caller. All
the other Ministers paid their successors the
courtesy of introducing them to the under-secret-
aries and the higher officials of their new depart-
ments and formally handing over the office. But
when Mr. Wise dropped in to assume the duties
of Attorney-General the late Premier “wasunfo:
tunately engaged, elsewhere.”
ON PAPER.
HER: “ He said you couldn't earn a pound u week."

Edmund Barton has been offered, within

sequent right to Premiership, and an Attorney-
Generalship, and has declined the lot.
MELBOURNE'S LAST WORD.
1ST HERETIC : “ What did you think of Amy
Castles' singing at her farewell concert .”
2ND HERETIC (hesitating): “ Well — ee—I thought
there was just about as much feeling"
1ST HERETIC (interrupting): “As in the Age’s
criticism. Come and have a drink.”
Connoisseurs in such matters say that the
Lyne team of Ministers is, taken all round, the
best-looking in face and build N.S.W.' has en-
joyed. The God-fearing Ministry- the good-
looking Ministry; the first sounds Pharisaical,
the second nan-nannv.
Lord Elibank, an old-time warrior and
modern globe-trotter who will soon be trotting
around Australia, carries a snap-shot camera with
him. He will be able to get studies of one or two
Australian Governors in a splendid assortment
of unrehearsed attitudes.
N.S.W. Leg. Councillor Sam M‘Caughey’s
income is estimated at .£150,000 per annum. The
other day he bought 300 tons of pipes for irriga-
tion purposes—the outcome, probably, of the
decision given last year whereby he had to lower
the by-washes of his dams.
Recently died at Caulfield (Vic.) Jones,
the man who started the first train in that pro-
vince. He was Flinders-street station-master
from the early 50’s until a few years ago, having
been taken over with the old Hobson’s Bay line
when Government bought it in the 70’s.
King O’Malley, the Yankee Jabberwock,
has finally shaken the dust of S.A. off his feet,
and is going to settle in Tasmania. “ I think the
climate will suit me,” he says. If O’Malley takes
a hand in the politics of the Land of Nod, there
will certainly be a change in the climate.
The last official act of N.S.W. Attorney-
General Reid was to direct a discontinuance of
the proseoution of Gilbert Probyn Smith, the
Nortonian pamphleteer. “ Jack ” Want estab-
lished a precedent for no re-trial in a criminal-
libel case, when he, strangely enough, refused to
have John Norton re-tried for the “open letter”
to colleague Carruthers. The question is: Is
Norton displeased or delighted ?
Henry Clarke, M.L.A., the omission of
whose name from the list of new N.S.W. Ministers
excited animadversion in some quarters, voted
with the Opposition on the censure motion. He
has been 32 years a member of Assembly, missing
only one Parliament in all that time. But Clark
himself did not inspire or supplement this good
feeling of his friends, for at his age, nearing 80,
additional responsibility would be onerous. *
F. W. Holder, who has made the annual
Budget speech in S.A. Assembly every year since
*94, has probably succeeded so well as Treasurer
in these lean years because he has always had to
pay attention to the pence. He began life in the
ill-paid S.A. public-school service, became
proprietor and editor of one of the smallest of
country sheets, took a hand in local municipal
work, and stepped into Parliament, and almost at
once into office. He is the thinnest man in Aus-
tralian politics, and one of the readiest ; also
about the most confirmed Methodist local-
preacher.
Gov. Tennyson has the bookish man’s
aspect of short-sightedness. When he is talking
to you, he looks at you as though you were small
type and rather hard to read. Also, he has a
queer little way of saying quaint things out of the
corner of his mouth —so that he may smile with
the other side. Beyond that, he is the typical
English country gentleman with a Cambridge
training, not (after his father’s ideal) “ mouthing
out his hollow oes and aes, deep-chested music,”
but speaking with the regulation University
accent. Professor Morris (Melbourne’s official
literary mentor) and Tennyson might easily pass
for brothers in aspect, manner of speaking, and
style of looking.
The other day that patient magistrate and
ex-Mayor, Joel Eade, one of the oldest beaks and
identities now left on -Collingwood Flat, was
knocked up at 3 a.m. in cold, wet weather to
bail a drunk out of the lock-up. Joel has the
ill-luck to live nearly opposite the police-
station, and, being the handiest J.P.,
there’s a great run on him all round the
clock. He was wanted as usual by the
mother-in-law, or aunt, or some other
relation, of a drunk, and he went,
i But nary a stamp the people had for
the bail-bond. Then a messenger was
sent round the neighborhood to get ss.
worth of stamps, while old-man Eade
toasted his shins at the watch-house fire.
In the course of an hour or two the mes-
senger returned with 120 halfpenny
stamps ! The watch house-keeper and the
beak and the messenger and the drunk
(now pretty sober, and choking for a long
beer) combined to lick the stamps to the
bond, and then Joel had to cancel the
accursed things by writing his initials
and the date 120 times !
A Big Scrub coroner, who is very
polite when roused up to hold an inquest
(inquest means fees), but most cantanker-
ous when otherwise rooted out, lately fell
fold of a timber-getter, who promptly
retaliated with “ Old -no - corpse - no-
civility ! ” Excellent word-painting.
W. P. Crick agreed to accept the dolt’s post,
the Postmaster-Generalship, “until the advent of
Federation —if we last so long.” To take any
other portfolio would have involved too great a
sacrifice of legal business. Crick, the only real
N.S.W. legal “amalgam,” probably makes J 22500
a year by court practice. He is regularly briefed
by other solicitors to appear for them, and gets
briefs marked with figures which many a leading
barrister would envy.
Tit-Bart. Newnes, writing, in Melb. Age,
re the departure of the Southern Cross expedition,
evidently imagines that Australasia has but one
province, and that Hobart is the capital thereof.
“The keenest interest in Antarctic research is
felt in Australasia. The Governor, Viscount
Gormanston, presided at a banquet,” &c., &c.
How cruelly thus Newnes discounts his <icojraph,i-
cal interest in the expedition ! Just the same old
big ad. —and nothing more.
Vic. M.L.C. Ham is about the most harm-
less politician extant; but once he got off a wheeze
which makes his fellow Fatmen groan with Scotch-
byterian horror even unto this day. Cuthbert, the
only Minister in the Upper House, was submitting
a tolerably democratic measure, and, while object-
ing to some modifications suggested by Nat. Levi,
M. had accepted more important changes
from Campbell, M.L.C. Whereupon, remarked
Ham, “I am sorry to see the Solicitor-General
following this course. He strains at a Nat., but
has nevertheless swallowed a Campbell.”
Chief-J ustice Darley celebrated his 69th
birthday on September 18. In Nov. next he wil|
be 13 years C.J. All the Judges on N.S.W.
Supreme Court Bench at date of his appointment
are dead. When Darley was barrister, J. 11.
Want, R. E. O’Connor, and C. E. Pilcher (all
distinguished to-day) read law under him. He
was called to the Irish bar in 1853. He happened
accidentally to meet the late Alfred Stephen,
N. Chief Justice, touring the old country,
and Stephen, owing to the congested state of law
business there, invited him to Sydney. He came,
and in time took Alfred Stephen’s seat as N.S.W.
Chief-Justice.
The great-grandson and namesake of
Joseph Holt, the Wicklow farmer who more than
any other individual incited the Irish Rebellion of
1798, was married at North Sydney on September
6. That great-grandfather spent over 14 years in
N.S.W., a sentence of death recorded against
him being commuted to transportation. A private
feud first drove hint to the ranks of the rebels.
When there his abilities as an organiser and his
turn for military tactics gave him a leading posi-
tion and won him the title of “General.” He
was betrayed and captured. In the little Botany
Bay rebellion of 1804 Holt got embroiled. His
own asseveration was that, so far from aiding the
disaffected convicts, he had exerted all his in-
fluence to repress disorder, but he was banished
to Norfolk Island notwithstanding. Sixteen
years after his conviction in Ireland he received a
free pardon, and returned to Dublin where the
balance of his life passed tranquilly.

Local-preacher Muggins got bushed in the
Jingeras, and had to put up for the night at
Muldoon’s. Hadn’t long turned in when rain
started, and began to irrigate him from a crack in
the roof. He got a light and looked round for a
remedy, and seeing a carpet-bag in a corner opened
it and hung it on a nail in the rafter, so as to inter-
cept the dropping. But the rain came faster, and
long before morning the bag filled —and fell. It fell
on Muggins and blackened his eye in a dreadful
fashion. He had to go on his way to toil in the
vineyard with the discredited optic, and naturally
everybody asked him how it came about. And
Muggins, being a good Christian, told the exact
truth that was stranger than fiction—that a port-
manteau of water bad fallen on his eye in the
night. Muggins never went to that part of the
vineyard again, but the discredit he and his eye
and his explanation brought on the church was a
blow from which the good cause hasn’t recovered
even yet.

“Old Shikari”; Re “C.F.’s” sambur-
python yarn. Waterton considered phenomenal
a 30ft. boa, of which he preserved the skin, and
Col. Pollok, 30 years a Public Works official, in
the jungles of Burma and Assam, and knowing
more than anyone else about the “shikar” of
those countries, never saw a python over 20ft. He
and I once saw a wild-boar-and-python fight on
the Monaso, and the pig killed the snake. Col.
P. had a sainbur’s head spreading sft. 9in. in the
antlers, the brow-antlers being each 20£in. long.

Cause and effect:—
Croydon, August 21.
A number of publicans to-day were fined for keeping
liquor mixed with ingredients having a deleterious effect,
the evidence showing there had been adulteration by
aniline and sulphuric acid. The prosecutions were laid
at the instance of Inspector Gabriel, who has been testing
liquors here lately.
Croydon, August 30.
Four deaths have occurred from liquor here during
the last fortnight
Melbourne Table Talk tells the most
gruesome cat yarn of the decade: —
Westralia fears the rabbit pest which, coming from
S.A., is already within her borders but has yet a con-
siderable stretch of desert country to overcome before it
can reach the more hospitable regions of the agricultural
country. The exploded idea of encountering the invad-
ing bunnies with an army of hungry cats was revived ;
and the “Groper” intellect being persuaded that
the failure of the experiment elsewhere was
merely owing to the want of a proper under-
standing of the means by which the full measure
of feline ferocity may be awakened, a cargo
of cats was procured at Albany and shipped on
board a schooner, without food or water, for the
voyage to Eucla. Never was the law- of “ survival of the
fittest” in more active operation than during the voyage
of that lone schooner across the Bight, and never were
such fearsome sounds of woe heard from anything afloat
since the Phantom Ship with its crew of lost souls was
last encountered. Not a single cat escaped from that
ship, yet only 40 per cent, of the original complement
were landed; and a few scraps of fur were all that was left
to indicate the sad fate of the missing majority. At Es-
perance, where the schooner touched en route, a resource-
ful “ dead-beat ” had a little shipment of cats—all that
town contained—to offer on his own account, and for
these he netted the munificent price of £1 each. But his
villainy was discovered before the schooner sailed, and a
heart-rending scene ensued. Anxious householders,
peering into the hold, could distinguish their
own plump Toms and Tabbies fighting for their
lives against a horde of famine-stricken spectres,
but were powerless to save them. The police were
appealed to in vain, and there was no rescuer brave
enough to venture into the hold. At Eucla, when the
schooner came alongside the jetty, the crew scrambled
ashore, leaving one hero to open the hatches ; '• and what
remained of the oat cargo landed itself in exactly 3$
seconds. They have since only once been heard of—when
they beseiged the camp of a lone prospector who only
saved his life by three hours’ hard work with a toma-
hawk, opening and throwing to the horde of famishing
pussies his six months’ store of tinned meats.
Sounds beautifully incredible, and yet strangely
’Groperesque things do happen in ’Groper Land.

“ F.li.A.” : The “hoo-hoo-hoo ! ” inquired
about by “ J.C.G.” (8., 26/8/’99) is the cry of the

to or right in the ground when it calls. Have at
times vainly tried for hours to find the creature,
but at other times have succeeded first try. Al-

“ Rhaumac” : Re whale-catching in nets at
Whangamunui, M.L. (B. 5/8/’99), there is no
“ Captain ” Cook in it. Years ago an old Peter-
head (Scotland) skipper told “Bertie” Cook how
a whale had been entangled in an ordinary fishing-
net on the Scottish coast. Together they dis-
cussed the feasibility of making a large-mesh
strong net, and, as a result, the present mode of
whale-catching near Cape Brett speaks for itself.
Last time writer was at the whaling station at
Whangamunui the nets were in sections 36ft. sq.,
the meshes being 6ft. sq. The sections are depended
from a strong wire hawser which is either run out
from shore to rock, having deepwater channel
between, or run from a point on the rocky coast
out seaward and moored at outer end. Each sec-
tion of net is made fast to wire hawser by light
lashings and there is a buoy at each end of seotion.
Whale strikes a section, hawser-fastenings snap,
and whale’s head becomes enveloped in net.
Whale never goes backward, cannot do so, but
keeps boring ahead, gets tired out, then lance and
harpoon finish him. Cook is now trying steel-wire
hawsers, which answer very well. This season’s
returns are very good, but there has been much
loss of net seotions owing to stormy weather.

“8.5.”: Anybody ever noted swine’s
inability to locate sound ? A train which passes
here is locally known as the “ pig-killer ” from
the havoc it makes amongst the grunters. If
“ Dinnis ” sees train first, he gets clear; otherwise
he looks solemnly in some other direction till
train hits him. When a boy I was once jogging
along with a basket of butter on a stiff-legged
“ crock.” Pig appeared in the dust, and, hearing
the horse’s tread, grunted enquiringly at every
compass-point but the right one; and brought
down “crock” and rider. Then he calmly
devoured the cow-product, while I bemoaned a
crushed ankle.

A recently-pulled big crop of turnips in

This “ tyle of love” in the very vulgar
tongue, sent by a Parramatta man, is not much,
considered as a poem. But, for all that, it has
point about it: —
Queensland bush has of late been fertile
in the horrible. About a month ago a settler in a
Southern agricultural district found the body of a
man impaled on a stump. A fallen tree lay
beside the stump. The luckless man had been
felling timber, and this particular tree had
knocked him backwards and pinned his body on a
sharp stump behind him. Four days elapsed
before the discovery was made.

“ F.” : Re jibbing horses and cures.
Recently saw a nag in a cart stick-up his driver
on the tram-line in Elizabeth-street, Sydney.
Nothing would make him shift until a tram came
along behind and the driver puffed up to the cart
and steadily pushed it along 20 or 30yds. The
old horse hung back valiantly, but he had to go,
and he eventually walked away with his head
hung in shame and a pained expression in his eye.

One of the most wonderful inventions of
the age is Willson’s discovery of crystalline carbide
of calcium. There is little doubt that acetylene
gas is about to revolutionise artificial lighting.
As with all successful patents, a host of pirates
have started up to try and rob Willson of his
rights. However, the recent decision of the High
Courts at Leipsic, Germany, will somewhat damp
the ardour of Willson’s opponents. It has been
decided that Willson is undoubtedly the discoverer
of crystalline carbide of calcium. Following up
this success, the English Acetylene Company nave
issued a batch of writs against infringers, and the
Acetylene Gas Co. of Australasia Ltd., of 36 Pitt-
street, Sydney—who own the Willson patents for
Australasia—are getting ready to give the Aus-
tralian pirates a surprise. This co. have now fitted
up some hundreds of installations around Sydney,
and are prepared to give estimates for any kind of
acetylene installations. Write direct to 36 Pitt-
street, and beware of infringers.*

Eggsof both varieties of butcher-bird arealike—greenish
with red or brown spots. Have found one exception—
eggs pale blue, with black spots at big end. These eggs
(got at King's school, Parramatta, in ’B4 and ’B5) were of
the black-and-white bird. Have also noticed at least
three varieties of magpie’s eggs, with apparently no dif-
ference in the birds. Also—with again no apparent dif-
ference in the birds—two varieties of peewit’s eggs. One,
longish, pale pink, with small purple spots (usually in ring
round big end). Other, salmon-pink, with brown
blotches. This egg is short, and tapers quickly to a
point. I might mention that in ordinary seasons all
native birds will continue to build and lay until they
fledge two broods. A pair of coots, on Parramatta
River, were persistently robbed of their eggs from Aug.
to Dec., yet they hatched out a brood in Jan., and a
second brood at beginning of April. Started laying again
in Aug.

“ An Australian Woman,” to Bulletin :
Re Australians marrying Chinamen and other colored
aliens, personally lam so jealous for my country’s good
that I would not even have these aliens enter Australia,
or, having them here, I think there ought to be a law
prohibiting them intermarrying. All the same, however,
I do not wonder that these aliens are often so favored.
Have seen and heard of some that Australians would do
well to copy. Kindness to animals, and especially to
horses, appeals powerfully to an Australian woman, and
influences her strongly in the choice of a husband. Dur-
ing six years’ station life I have had chance to notice that
the horses of alien hawkers are always in fine condition,
and that there is always plenty of feed in the vans. These
men also were careful to rug their horses on chilly nights.
Noticed, on other hand, that an alleged white hawker on
6ame track with two vans always had his horses in
pitiable condition. Never carried chaff, even when the
track was as bare as a baking-board, and often had a
horse die on the road. Knew a station manager to refuse
to sell him a horse on account of his callous brutality.
Chinamen are specially kind to horses, and I have known
them displaj - thoughtful kindness otherwise, as in case of
one here, who, after marrying a white woman, discovered
that she was both immoral and drunken, whereupon he
made her a comfortable allowance and left her. Perhaps
Australians grow callous from being so accustomed to the
spectacle of drought-perishing animals dying by inches
and tortured by crows, flies, and ants. Have often won-
dered how men could pass a creature in this condition,
when a knife-thrust, or a revolver bullet would end its
agony.

“A.E.G.” : Once knew a miner, “ Geor-
die,” who liked his meat raw. Have often seen
him buy a lb. of steak, and “scoff ” it right there
in the shop with apparent satisfaction. He never
used tea, coffee, or beer, and always wore three
suits of woollen clothes, which he changed every
night, the innermost suit becoming in turn the
outermost. Also, he never used a bed, but slept
in a large chair. Snuffed out at 84. No tuber-
culosis about him although he gave it every
chance.

Working Men’s College, Melb., the other week.
Some of his facts and figures are well worth
remembering. “In 1801 a scientist employed
by Napoleon reported that not one of Great
Britain’s colonies cultivated the vine for wine-
making purposes, and that fact holds good to
almost as great an extent at the present time.
. . . Australia now produces about three
million gallons of wine from 49,000 acres of
land. . . Paris alone could consume in 12
days the whole annual production of Victorian
wine. ... It is apparent that if Australia
were an out-and-out wine country there would
be no need for an export trade just now.
. . . Australia has ten million acres of
vine-growing land, and seeing that a good
vineyard is worth £3O "per acre, this
means a possible capital value of three
hundred millions sterling, or even with only
one-tenth of that area under cultivation, thirty
millions of money ; while the industry would
then give employment to thousands of men who
at present roam about the large cities, seeking
work but securing none.” Having pointed out
the sound temperance principles of wine as
compared with spirits and beer, and having
assured the audience that Australia is already
producing a chablis that can’t be beaten any-
where, the lecturer slung a stone at the
Philistines who decry all the products of their
own country, and will never say half a good
word for Australian wines. And these, by the
way, are mostly wine-purchasers and land-
owners who would be advancing their own
interests if they were to abandon their
prejudices and start to drink the local article
for the benefit of Australia.

“ Royal Artillery ” to The Bulletin :
_ The Peace Conference kicked up a dust about “ explo-
sive bullets and asphyxiating shells,” but these concern
nobody but the actual fighting men, who can take care
of themselves, and suffer less than others from the real
horror of battle. Civilians suffer by their crops being trod-
den down, their towns and villages being held as fortified
posts, taken and retaken, and aboveall by bombardments.
The Germans in France, in 1870, constantly resorted to
this barbarous measure, hoping that the governors of
strong places would surrender to save the inhabitants.
They carried their point at Strasburg, but failed at Bel-
fort. The garrison of a fortress always have plenty of
bomb-proof cover for themselves and their stores. There
they are safe from the shells which are shattering and
burning the civil buildings. Whole towns have been
laid in ruins, and thousands of their people killed without
the fortifications being injured, or more than a dozen or
two of the garrison hurt. Strasburg was bullied, Paris
and Metz were starved into surrender, and the bombard-
ment of Paris was a piece of gratuitous brutality wld-h
did not hasten the surrender by a day.
GOLD TRESSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You stand at my hnee, Gold Tresses,
Most true of all lovers of mine,
With lips that are fashioned for hisses
And fingers that thrill where they twine.
And bitter at heart, thus early,
And weary of life am I,
And you are so happy, girlie,
—The sun and the birds say why!
Your heart is so pure, Gold Tresses :
You know of no life like mine
That is hot to the brow with kisses
And red to the lips with wine
The hate in her courtly greetings,
The scorn of her soft replies,
The shame of her stolen meetings,
The grief of her wild good-byes.
Oh! Fashion your wreaths in the sunlight
Untouched of the mist and the ram,
For youth is the rose-light, the one light
That never will gird us again;
And ours is the load you must borrow,
And ours is the path you must fare,
Who have passed by the archways of Sorrow
And knoclted at the gates of Despair.
You nestle with soft arms around me;
Your face is upturned to my own ;
The chaim that have crippled and bound me
Lie heavy and cold as a stone ;
And out to the sunligh t there surges
A passionate longing and wild—
Ah! These are the whips and the scourges,
The lips and the hands of a child.

J. W. JOHNSTON & CO.,
746 GEORGE STREET (Haymarfcet), SYDNEY
Swanston St., Mtlb. Queen Sv, Brisbane.
“ All the world’s a stage, and all the men
and women merely players.” This applies to the
present “sassiety ” world with particular aptness.
Now, considering that the success of the players
depends upon the manner in which they dress
their parts, and that it is necessary for lovely
woman to look beautiful in all her moods, the
P.D. corset may be said to be indispensable to
her. Graced by a pair of P.JD’s., lovely woman
may confidently take the centre of the stage at
any social gathering.*
Country readers would do well to try the
“Albatross Lamp Wick.” “It requires no trimming,"
saves oil, has no smell whatever, and it is almost impos-
sible to have an explosion of a lamp in which they are
used. Messrs. Chambers and Seymour, of Collins-street,
have one window entirely devoted to the Co.’s goods.*
My Melbourne correspondent continues :
“The history of the £2OO piano at Melbourne
Government House forms a queer chapter in
‘ nearness ’ in high places. Two years ago
Gov. Brassey hired the piano for use at
Government House functions, but he did not
pay the hire. The piano remained, and the hire
accumulated, but the old man disregarded the
bills. Finally he made the extraordinary claim
that Govt, ought to pay for the hire of the piano
for his (H.E.’s) entertainments. It would be
as reasonable to say that Govt, should have paid
his wine account or his pastry-cook’s bill. When
the hire had reached the amount of £OO the matter
came under Premier Turner’s notice, and, to save
further haggling, he said, ‘We will buy the in-
strument right out 1 ’ So he passed a cheque for
£2OO, and Brassey was left chuckling over the
fact that he had wriggled out of paying the £OO
hire. The official papers show that these are the
facts. But why not get the whole of the papers
in print ?
“Melbourne highflyers, at present sampling
Sydney gaieties, worry the girls they left behind
them herealxmts with written rhapsodies over the
increased smartness discernable in daughters of
the Harbour city. Maybe their bachelor Governor
and all that hangs thereby acts as a pick-me-up to
the fascinations of fair Northerners who even be-
fore said stimulus promised sooner or later to give
Viotoriennes a run for the championship. The
belle of ’9B Cup was a Sydney matron, and the
frankest, friskiest toilettes at subsequent shoulder-
shows were worn by same charmer and her com-
patriotes. _ Also Melbourne’s solitary genius, pro-
fessed cynic and misogynist that he is, seemingly
joys more or less in the sympathetic society of a
charming Sydney-sider, now the wife of a local
professional man.
“It is becoming tony in Melbourne to entertain
your friends at a hotel or cafe instead of by your
ain fireside. Accordingly two or three of the best
pubs, are toeing the mark and showing great style.
One hostelry has imported a chef who transforms
plain mutton and ‘ wild rabby ’ into high-sounding
1 ’renchy dishes; the menu is so very up-to-date
that if you were to ask for tripe-and-onions or
Irish stew, the chef would throw up his billet in
disgust. At dinner-time you chew to the music of
a string band, and on all first-nights it is correct
to dine-your theatre-party there first and after the
play run them off somewhere else for supper.
'“lsn’t it time it was made a penal offence to
quote that battered old pome, ‘Oh woman in our
hours of case ’? Of course it was trotted out at
the Woman’s Suffrage struggle, though it has
about as much bearing on the question as Pea-
cock’s laugh has on Federation. It is so untrue
on the surface of it. The average woman spends
most of her hours of ease in yarding up the uncer-
tain, coy masculine, and when she has married
him he seems to spend his life in patting himself
on the back for his own magnanimity in giving her
free board and lodging, and making all sheol stir
if the chops are burnt.
“ Miss Goldstein has thrown aside the tennis-
racquet which brought her some suburban glory,
and has taken up the political racket. With
brother-in-law Champion directing her tactics, the
dark-eyed kitten of the Cat Cause made a bid for
notoriety. She lay in wait to catch the cautious
legislators night after night in the lobby of the
House with the result that when the Bill came
on they all had something sweet and oily to say of
the pretty persecutrix. Perhaps they threw out
the Bill harder than usual in the hope that Miss
G. will come and worry them again next time.
“The gallant lieutenant who was hitherto the
only local military johnnie to support a solitary
eyeglass, has been robbed of his individuality by a
visitor from Madras, who wears tight pants,
waxed moustache, and a window-pane, with an
air of active service thrown in.
You must no longer roll your veil in a
ball under the chin. Hitch it a little higher
and, let it rest calmly on the chin’s edge. I
don’t think women will take affectionately to the
new style. What a watch-chain is to a man when
words fail him was that little twist of veil to a
woman in any sort of mental quandary. She could
always depend on it to help her out. If she
couldn’t make herself understood, she unrolled the
knot —knob —it’s a mysterious thing, I hardly
know what to call it—twitched her veil, and rolled
it up again feeling considerably better. To give
this up will be a sort of ave atque vale, I should
imagine.
“Why doesn’t the A.N.A. popularise Austra-
lian literature by prescribing selections therefrom,
for its annual elocutionary competitions ? ‘Den-
ver’s Dream ’ (Silver King) is epidemic just now,
thanks to the Natives. And detached from the
context, it’s such a gratuitously gruesome passage.
At mild suburban at-homes, it’s horrid for un-
comprehending non-theatre-going hearers when a
leather-lunged reciter swells the veins on his fore-
head, bites his lips till they bleed, and bellows—
He stood up in his winding-sheet. And the face was
Geoffrey Ware's ! I took him by the throat—throttled
him—rammed him into his coffin, etc.
Or —
The rope was round my neck ; the hangman drew the
bolt! I dropped—dropped—dropped !
“A curious mistake occurred at a recent Melb.
suburban wedding. The contracting parties were
young persons of some provincial consequence,
and the assembled guests were large and varie-
gated. The fittings and the decorations were of
the kind that paralyse the sassiety reportress, and
the breakfast promised to be a perfect dream. The
wedding was due on the premises, and when the
hour struck people stood round awaiting events.
The bridegroom dropped in to keep his appoint-
ment, and the young lady was waiting, and no-
body could discover what was lacking, although
there was a general awkwardness, and a sort of
stiff feeling arising from a presentiment that all
was not well. Suddenly, amidst a painful silence,
the bride’s papa ‘fetched a yell,’and cried deso-
lately, ‘ Dear, dear ! I know what it is—l quite
forgot the parson ! ’ That was the trouble—no
parson had been ordered, and none was laid on to
solemnise the ceremony. Two guests, the best
man, and the bride’s father arose in heat, and tore
off in several directions in quest of a rapid parson,
and all returned in the course of twenty minutes
or so, each with a spiritual master in tow. Then
the wedding progressed in an atmosphere of deep
gloom occasioned by the awful hauteur and in-
jured spirituality of the three shepherds who did
not get the billet, but lagged superfluous on the
scene.
“ Strange that so many prominent men have
nothing but daughters to inherit their abilities, or
else rejoice with trembling in a too-precious only
son. Under the latter category come Gov.
Brassey, Judge Madden, Premier Turner, Dr.
Maudsley, and parson E lgar, while surgeon Fitz-
gerald, Ministers Isaacs and Best, Trenwith,
M.L.A., and various ’Varsity profs, have girls
only. Bishop Goe and Rabbi Abrahams are
childless.
“An appalling story to the effect that a Scottisli
Volunteer kilt hangs m its pride alone, with ne’er
an undergarment to keep it in countenance turns
out to be a wicked fable. Somebody has learned
from a military tailor that the wind is tempered to
the shorn sham Highlander in a quite respectable
manner, so one may now criticise a parade of the
new regiment without blushing at the thought of
what revelations might ensue if the bare-kneed
heroes were to march on a piece of orange-peel or
get surprised by a hurricane. It appears, though,
that the Melbourne canard was founded on fact.
Some years ago a real Scottish regiment, serving
in China at the time, adapted itself to the
warm weather as regards the mysteries of its
toilet. All went cool and pleasant with the reck-
less creatures until a storm came and disclosed the
bare rationalism of their costume, so to speak.
Whereupon the majah, or colonel, in command
gave them a good dressing-down and told them to
‘ have ’em all on ’ for the future, weather or no.
“ A local dame recently invited clergy. and
others to a * novel ’-evening and feels ten years
older in consequence. The first trouble came with
a little Miss who carried a packet of Epsom-salts
to represent ‘ The Disturbing Element.’ Another
charmer displayed a picture of a beautiful Eastern,
inscribed ‘ Bath-sheba, whom David, the king,
loved ! ’ ‘ Can’t you guess ?’ she laughed— ‘ Why,
Dave’s Sweetheart! ’ The poor hostess, remem-
bering their reverences across the room, put down
her foot. The profanity of it! ‘ Dave, ’ indeed!
“ Two fair society leaders are at daggers drawn
and their enmity to each other is a joke that goes
on for ever. At the races particularly, it is the
best fun in the world to watch their respective
circles of satellites —the one matron being crooned
over mainly by relatives ; the other by the more
swaggah herd. It is a four-year-old story. One
of the sistern in her spinsterhood beamed tenderly
upon her present brother-in-law who was secured
after a desperate struggle (in which a barmaid
figured) by the other fair girl. And now the
figuring Hebe—but that is another story.
“ It is disturbing to think that some of the un-
venerable old Scots in the Legislative Council
who grunted ‘No’ at the Woman Suffrage Bill
have possibly chuckled over this awful paragraph
from the Fife (Scotland) Herald :— ‘ The cham-
pion sow at the Highland Show died on Thursday
from apoplexy caused by the great heat. During
the day a number of ladies fainted in the grand-
stand owing to the sultry weather.’
“ One of the best speeches in support of women’s
suffrage in Vic. Leg. Council was made by Baronet
Rupert Clarke, who said he had recently been
making diligent enquiries on the subject among
all classes in Adelaide. Whereupon his brother
legislators laughed loudly, and ‘our only bart.’
said he didn’t see anything to be amused about.
Big Clarke 111. ’ is a much better speaker than
his father was, and shows positively dangerous
signs of advancement in a Liberal direction. He
supported the One-man-one-vote Bill, barracks
for the Turner Govt., and advocates Women’s
Suffrage.

A GALLANT RESCUE.

Vic. Customs department acknowledged the

The most recent—and most
promising Maoriland industry is
bacon-curing. Eight years after the
dairy-factory system fairly started the
“ cockies ” began to realise that skim-
milk is the' ideal food for pigs.
Thousands of calves have been knocked
on the head to make room for more
profitable stock. Bacon-factories are
springing up like mushrooms. One in
Stratford, the centre of the dairy dis-
trict, cost £lO,OOO to erect and furnish.
3d. to 3id. per lb. is at present the ruling
price for hog-meat. Meanwhile, the drovers
are not displeased ; the abnormal slaughter of
calves means high prices for dairy cows in the
near future.
An investigation into the “ fines ” imposed by
big city draperies would reveal much pitiable hardship.
Some firms have as many as 40 offences on the list, carry-
ing fines ranging from 3d. up to 6s. Many of the offences
look as if put there as a means of taking back a portion of
the wages given. An eye should be given to this in the
next Factory legislation. Here, for instance, is an item
from a long list: “If any shall say or do an vthing
contrary to the interests of this establishment— 2s. 6d.’
And the firm is accuser, jury, and judge.

A candid admission (which litigants will please
paste on one of their bed-posts) made at a late stage of the
Harrold Bros, insolvency case in Adelaide. One set of
counsel (all S.A. lawyers are counsel) had made up
its little bill—balance unpaid, £853. “ But,” said
‘Sonah’, “it must be taxed.” “In that case v’onah
will y’onah permit it to be withdrawn? Y’onah will know
that bills have to be more carefully drawn when they are
to be presented for taxation than when they are rendered
to a client.”

The way of virtue is sometimes made hard. A
woman entered a M.L. lawyer’s olttee, a few weeks ago
and explained that sometime hack she had obtained
judgment in a case against a neighbour. lie was then a
drunkard and “ doing a perish”; now he had “turned
teetotaller and was earning good money,” so that a judg-
ment summons might profitably issue.

Several Viet. Govt, servants are commissioners
for affidavits and are allowed to put the fee of Is. 6d. in
their own pockets- This is a pernioious practice which in
some quarters has developed somethin? like blackmail-
In a number of cases the affidavit has to be sworn in con-
nection with some document that passes through the
hands of an officer who holds the commission, and it is
peculiar to note how soon a matter wherein the
affidavit has been sworn before that particular officer gets
through as compared with a matter wherein the affidavit
has been sworn before someone else. In one department
there is an officer who is reputed to make between £5 and
£6 a week out of affidavits, in addition to his salary,
which is £375 a year. It is said that out of the fees of
affidavits this official has built a mansion for himself worth
at least £5OOO.

“ Business Man ” : A matter of greater public
interest than appears at first glance is that of inducing
N.S.W. Telephone Dept, to issue its “ List of Subscribers ”
book in a stouter and more serviceable cover than it
appears to consider necessary. The book is nearly always
out of cover within a week of issue, thus rendering un-
available the information printed on the rotten paper of
the cover. My protests have hitherto resulted only in
the stereotyped intimation that my “communication has
been received.”

Re the common and inferentially-
insulting notification—“ This business is now under en-
tirely new management." In a Sydney suburb, the other
day, I came across a miserable huckster’s shop (containing
about a crown’s worth of bilious-looking lollies) boldly
displaying the legend, “ This business has recently
changed hands for the better.”

Sydney is a beautiful place to hustle for an existence in at

The average mining-man is indeed a poor-spirited
creature. He will submit to being robbed in the most
barefaced manner without protests—robbed, not by clever
manipulation or cute swindling, but by forgery, embezzle-
ment, and plain ordinary larceny. The cool effrontery of
many legal managers pulls them through meetings of
their shareholders, after they have been shown to have
unaccountable shortages in the cash ; and the strange part
of it is that the same men who fear to prosecute would not
hesitate a moment to run in any miserable wretch
caught stealing their fowls. One legal manager, bowled
out months ago, gave three distinct and different ex-
planations of a deficiency, and though all were proved
lies, no shareholder has yet got out a warrant.

An auctioneer had hard luck t’other day. He
had run up a piano—with several keys that only went
“woof’’when you touched them —to about £2O. When
the bidder was found and was just giving his name, two
policemen rushed in r.nd took him away. He had just
escaped from an adjacent lunatic asylum. Of course, the
auctioneer couldn’t get at the next-best bid, and when he
put the wheezy instrument up again it was passed in at
30s.

Lawyers sometimes come off second-best. In
Oollingwood (Vic.) Police Court once a marine-store
dealer was fined £5 for some breach of the Act
under which he held a license. His solicitor gave
notice of appeal. Ten minutes afterwards defendant
appeared in Court and handed £5 to the clerk. The
P.M., noticing this, enquired why he was paying the fine,
as his lawyer was appealing. Defendant, with a cunning
leer : “ Oh, yes, I know ; he wants to get more money out
of me. Fust loss, best.”

The trustees of a Sydney suburban church, in
trying to raise money for a new school-house by mort-
gaging the tabernacle, called on one Cohen (who didn’t
like the risk). “ Got the Lord’s permission to mortgage?”
he asked. “ No.” “ Den, vat you mean by coming to me
to mortgage vat isn’t yours? You just bring me de
Lord’s written bermission, and I vill let you have de
monish at 10 per shent 1 "
The other night one of the new George-street
(Sydney) electrice-tramway cars made its first ap-
pearance, drawn by horses, causing immense
interest. The effect when the real thing does
turn up is depicted above—by a Yankee artist.
“E.K.”: Money is being spent in trying to
catch the tote and bookie. The other day a couple of
Vic. officers found trouble in indulging in the time-
honored palm-grease—out of which Robert has built so
many rows of houses. What sort of grease must the
lottery-Chow use, and where is it applied? John will sell
openly to police or parsons, no questions asked—only pay
your money for a chance, and a very poor one, in a game
which no one rightly understands ; in fact, it is doubtful
if you get a chance at all, for you never see the drawing.
Yet the banks are open—wide open—all hours for seven
days a week. Once in every months somebody (not
the parson, for the boss Chow is generally a Clistian and
goes to church) cries out to the Chief of Police, and a
couple of summonses are the result. Boss John’s
“ cousin ” appears. The police know it is not boss
John (case in Melb. a few months back). Cousin
pleads guilty—asks time to pay fine. Ultimately
takes it out in gaol at a small weekly wage,
and boss John, in his diamond rings, smiles and goes
on selling tickets. But it’s the deadest of cer-
tainties that if a European started a lottery he wouldn’t
be let run it a week. The totes and the books have got
to learn the secret of John’s effectual palm-grease. There
has been in Melbourne for months past a lottery-boom—
men, women, and children play it openly.
The Pangs of Conscience vex us sore
In little things—and nothing more.
We pay with \ irtue for a vice
Ana revel in the sacritice
Provided i hat the payment be
A trilling dole in t. s. d.,
Or toil, or act of charity.
The man of high commercial rank
Will gaily victimise a bank,
The tnought of his ill-gotten gains
U.ves lu'ia no secret after-pains.
But should he, for a time, forget
To liquidate a paltry debt,
Remembering chat he cannot rest
Until ’tis jiaid with interest.
We never get a chance to laud
A merchant, who, for ‘‘drawback’'
fraud,
Makes reparation to the State
Upon “his own the fraud’s too
great.
But O ! they feel those Pangs who
rob
The Government of fifteen bob.


INDIGESTION
AND
INSOMNIA
CURED BY
Bile Beans!
Unsolicited Testimony from a Young Lady:
March 1, 1899.
Thb Bilb Bean Manufacturing Co.
Dear Sirs. —I suffered for over two years from acute indigestion. I could not
sleep. Night after night I passed in restlessness. Terrible pains assailed me in the chest
and nght shoulder, like a knife cutting through me. I had no appetite,
and no food would tempt me. I became completely run down, and
lost over two stone in weight. My skin became quite yellow and
pimply. A friend was saying how bad I looked, and asked if I had
tried Bile Beans. I said, “I am sick and tired of trying patent
medicines. But for an experiment I got a box and took a course.
I was surprised at the good they did me, and continued taking them,
loan eat and sleep well now, and no longer dread bed-time —in fact,
I never felt better mmy life. I can truthfully say that Bile Beans
have made an entirely different girl of me, and I can recommend
them to anyone suffering from indigestion.
You have my full consent to publish this in any way you please.
(Signed) ESTELLA ADAMS,
Augusta-street, Maylands,
Adelaide.
Bile Beans are an undoubted specific for biliousness, sick and nervous head-
ache, indigestion, constipation, influenza, colds, piles, female weakness, pale-faced
girls, bad breath, pimples, dizziness, all liver and kidney troubles, dyspepsia,
pain in back and side, fullness after
eating. Bile Beans are not an ordinary
medicine. They are manufactured in
one of the best-fitted and equipped labo-
ratories in the world, at Detroit, Michi-
gan, U.S.A., and they have been used
throughout that country by the best
physicians for years, and the amount of
time and labor expended in compound-
ing them would, even if someone had
the formula, exclude them from selling
them, as it is only on account of the
sales being in the millions annually that
they can be sold at the low price, owing
to the great cost of the ingredients.
Bile Beans are obtainable from store-
keepers and chemists generally, price
Is. l£d. per large box, post paid.

Mon Think nf Women.
What men minis OI women.
Beauty is only skin deep. The prettiest woman
is not always the most happy or the most sought
after. Men, lords of creation as thoy are, have
learned that a pretty face is not always a criterion
of amiability or a good constitution. Now-a-days
men are very careful to choose a life companion
from among the robust and healthy women rather
than one who is simply fair of face. Good
health is absolutely essential to happiness,
and many a man has found marriage a failure
through marrying a woman who is constantly
ailing, whose temper is irritable and who through
her own weakness, though without intent, makes
life a burden to all around her.
The internal organism of the female system is
so delicately constituted that it needs much care
and attention. Hence it is that women are not
able to enter into the rougher occupations of life.
If every natural physical function is not absolutely
regular in taking place, the woman’s life will be
more or less one of continual misery. There being
so many delicate female organs, it is but natural
that if one becomes in any way clogged or ham-
pered in its working by refuse matter the others
will be affected to a greater or less extent. The
circulation of the blood, too, if sluggish, will
weaken the action of the various organs. The
symptoms manifested by this condition of affairs
are numerous, among them may be mentioned
backaches, dizziness, fainting fits, pains in the
abdomen, loss of appetite and a general run-down
feeling.
Now, having explained what is necessary to
good health in woman, kindly let us impress upon
you the easiest and surest way to attain this end.
The system must be kept perfectly clear of refuse
matter, the circulation must be animated, and the
whole system toned up and kept in regular work-
ing order. All this can be accomplished by Bile
Beans for Biliousness. They purge the digestive
organs, increase the circulation, and invigorate
the liver. Once tried they will be found beneficial,
d their use continued the entire system will be
luned up and general health restored. A healthy
woman is always interesting, she is happy, and
her spirits are contagious. Good health and good
nature are inseparable ; secure the first by using
Bile Beans, and the latter will take care of itself.
Spring Time Cleaning.
Spring has arrived, and now the careful house-
wife goes through the annual spring house-clean-
ing. The summer will soon be upon us, and at
this time of the year we should take care to cleanse
the whole human system and fortify it to with-
stand the enervating effects of the Australian
summer. The increasing hot weather of this
period has an extremely debilitating effect
on the system if it is not in perfect
working order all through. It will be thus
seen that a, medicine which will regulate and
cleanse the interior mechanism of man, is especi-
ally valuable at this time of the year. Such a
medicine is Bile Beans, and no better preparation
can be found for toning up the digestive organs,
cleansing the blood, and invigorating the liver,
Spring generally brings with it an assortment of
ailments peculiar to this particular time of the
year ; such as spring fever, tired feeling, loss of
appetite, &c. For these take Bile Beans, which
are also a specific for biliousness, indigestion, con-
stipation, and debility. which are also very preva-
le nt attl “ a season. As a purgative, Bile Beans
are acknowledged without an equal in Australia.
Their price places them within reach of everyone,
anf j n 0 one B hould run the risk of being in ill-
health through the summer, when a short course
Q f j}j] e ]3 eana would effectually purify the body
aQ( j it iu thorough working order,
Very Excited.
In Mark Twain's new book, “Following the
Equator,” there is a description of a fox-nunt,
which closes with: “There was a man ahead of
the rest, and be came spurring straight at me.
He was fiercely excited. It was fine to see him
ride ;he was a master horseman. He came like a
storm till he was within seven feet of me, where I
was leaning on a wall; then he stood his horse
straight up in the air on his hind toenails and
shouted like a demon : * Which way’d the fox
go? ’ I didn’t much like the tone, but I didn’t let
on, for he was excited, you know. But I was
calm, so I said softly and without acrimony,
‘Which fox?’ It seemed to anger him —I don’t
know why—and he thundered out, ‘Which fox?
Why, the fox 1 Which way did the fox
go?’ I said, with great gentleness, even
argumentatively, *lf you could only be a little
more definite—a little less vague—because I am a
stranger, and there are many foxes, as you know
even better than I, and unless I know which one,
it is that you desire to identify, and ‘ You’re
certainly the biggest idiot that has escaped in a
thousand years 1 ’ and he snatched his great horse
around as easily as I would snatch a cat, and was
away like a hurricane. A very excitable man.”
Such excitement certainly Mark Twain was not
used to, and had the great author followed up the
horseman’s rapidly disappearing form with : “Say,
young fellow, you need a few Bile Beans for Bilious-
ness ; your liver needs stirring up ” ; it would have
been about what would be expected. Verily, ex-
citement wasteth the form and maketh the eyes
hollow and the face white. The three B.’s are the
antidote of exoitability. If you doubt, make a
trial. Mark Twain is certainly a humorist of the
first water, and such remarks as the above roll
from his lips as if he had planned them all for
weeks.
A Matter of Spelling.
An interesting little paper, called Akmy
News, tells the following amusing yarn of an ap-
plication for leave put in by an old Indian colonel,
the reason stated being an attack of gout. The
brigade-major, through whom the application
went, happened to meet the colonel the same
evening, and thought to politely condole with him
on his ailment. “ Sorry to hear, colonel, that you
are suffering from gout,” he remarked. “Gout,
sir,” roared the colonel, who was rather a peppery
old salt, “ what the devil do you mean? Never
had gout in my life. Gout, indeed!” “Well, I
didn’t mean to offend you,” said the brigade-
major, “ and, anyhow, you can’t deny that you
have applied for leave on account of gout.” “Oh,”
said the colonel, “ I remember now that I did say
gout. But, then, who can be expected to spell
such an infernal word as rheumatism ? ”
There would be no need of spelling rheumatism,
the word would soon become obsolete if the people
would only use Bile Beans for Biliousness. Try
them.

POLITICAL
POINTS
When Wise turns in his bed and sees
Fegan’a head on his pillow, he will realise that
politics makes a man acquainted with strange bed-
fellows.
B. R. Wise is the only member of the
Lyne Ministry who sits for a Sydney or Sydney
suburbs constituency. The Country Party has
arrived at last.
Vosper, of the Hair, finds it advisable to
trim his sails, and he lately wired to his Kalgoorlie
constituents that he was “entirely with the
Federal League in its demand for a referendum.”
The Lyne Ministry was born from a ques-
tion of purity of government —the Ministry of the
Immaculate Conception. And all the more so
because half its members don’t know who their
political fathers are.
Ex-Premier Reid’s groan that the new
Lyne Government is “ essentially conservative,”
comes with all the grace of a swollen elephant
from a man who did so very little for the demo-
cratic cause as G. H. R.
The Lyne Ministry consists of eight lay-
men and two lawyers—Wise and Crick. That is
an improvement on various past N.S.W. Minis-
tries. _ The Reid-Want-Gould-Carruthers-Hughes
combination looked too much like blue foolscap.
Broguey-man O'Loghlen, who deeply re-
sented the imputation that he went round with a
no-oonfidence motion in his pocket, arose in Vic.
Assembly to vindicate his character, and concluded
by bringing a paper from his breast pocket and
calmly reading a motion involving the life of the
Govt. In one Vic. session the bould O’Loghlen
moved 19 votes of want of confidence.
Q. Premier Dickson has placed One-man-
one-vote to the forefront in his political pro-
gramme. During the discussion thereupon at
the opening of Q. Parliament, the most surprising
thing was the attitude of certain staunch old
Govt. Tories who said they saw nothing to fear in
it, and were prepared to support it. One of them
actually clamoured for adult suffrage. Truly the
clock moves on.
MELB. MOOCHABOUTS—1, “FLIES.
(Sketched in Little Coll ins- street.)
The expression on the faces of the un-
portfolioed Lyneites, when the new N.S.W.
Premier announced the names of his Ministers in
N.S.W. Assembly, was too painful for descrip-
tion. No poor devil in the dock, with the Judge
passing sentence, ' ever looked so glum. Five
years of fighting, for what? For the other fellows
—not one of whom was half so faithful or so ser-
viceable as the disappointed.
Just before the Referendum, when it was
too late to do anything serious in the way of dis-
proving the idiotic lie, the Brisbane Parochialists
distributed, leaflets about the West Moreton dis-
trict of •Queensland, calling on all the farmers to
vote against Federation on the ground that if it
was carried they would all- have to surrender their
t' tie-deeds and yo to the expense of yetting .new ones
from the Central Govt. And many of them believed
it, too, and rushed to the poll to vote the paroohial
ticket for all they were worth.
Christchurch (M.L.) Trades Council has
ukased that the man it supports at the next elec-
tion must deposit his resignation with the Council
to be used as it thinks fit. The most probable
result is that the Council will have to lend its
support to the worst candidate in the crowd.
Maoriland Opposition is mak-
ing the sale of State lands a leading
feature of its platform, as against
the leasehold system favored by
the Seddon Govt. One of its
favorite arguments is that to
give a man a long lease at a low
rental is virtually making him a
big present, as the value of the
land must go up during his ten-
ure. Of course if you sell
the land to the same
man you make him
a bigger present
as the value of the
land must go up
during his tenure
also, and he has a
much longer ten-
ure, but that
point is kept very
dark. Also, the Russell
party weeps tears of
blood as it draws har-
rowing pictures of the
poor struggling selec-
tor toiling to meet his
rent —this is the same
individual previously
alluded to as the man
who wrongfully got the
big present of the un-
earned increment, and
thereby grew affluent at the State’s expense,
and whose sinful affluence requires to be put down.
And the poor freeholder struggling to meet the
interest on the mortgage is never once mentioned.
Tom Slattery, who proposes to capture
the Boorowa seat in N.S.W. Assembly, vacated
by poet-squatter-warrior Mackay, enjoys a unique
political reputation. Parkes, in ridicule, on one
occasion described him as a political Machiavelli,
and Tom and his friends took the shaft as earnest.
Ever since he has posed as a man with profound
knowledge of human nature, and of the surest
way by secret means of attaining political ends.
Gyinpie (Q.) Troth on the proposal of the
parson-edited Brisbane Telegraph that the North
should be cut adrift because it voted for Federa-
tion :
Let the metropolitan members demand Separation for
Brisbane. They might be disagreeably surprised at the
readiness of Parliament to comply. But there’s not
much hope of them doing anything of the sort. Para-
sites are not generally anxious to sever their connection
with the bodies on which they batten and wax fat.
Westralian wire :
An attempt by Mr. Illingworth to abolish plural voting
was defeated, the Premier pointing out that the time
had not arrived for Westralia to follow the example of
other colonies, and adopt one-man-one-vote.
Even John Forrest wasn’t game to say that
“one man one vote” was not a just principle;
only “the time had not arrived” to do justice.
But the time to do injustice has always arrived —
in the opinion of people like Forrest. .
It is expected that, to be consistent with
their action against the Coal-miners’ Relief Act,
immediately N.S.W. Parliament settles down to
business again M‘Gowen, Haynes, and others
will introduce legislation to do away with hos-
pitals because those institutions only save a por-
tion of the people from death ; and to withdraw
Govt, support from all charitable institutions
because they do not alleviate the distress of all
the indigents in the land.
. Lyne’s new Cornstalk Ministry has to
waste a month of valuable time on the hollow
mockery of being re-elected. At the ’9B election,
Lyne beat his only opponent by nearly 3to 1; and
all his colleagues had large majorities save B. R.
Wise, who got in by five votes. No one dreams
for a moment that any of them will be rejected—
it is a bitterly cold day when a Minister with
public works to give away is rejected; but the
month must be wasted all the same.
Pastor Rentoul, the one-eyed Presby-
terian bigot who leads the Melbourne Non-con-
formist conscience, comes out with a defence of
the Boer Govt, clever and convincing until one
reaches the final paragraph, which protests
against Britain making war upon “our fellow
Protestants.” This is the keynote of the whole
column of argument. When Britain was bully-
ing Holy Roman Catholic Ireland the Rentouls
of the land did their level best to sool on the
British lion.
No man did more for Federation in North
Queensland than one Crabb, a cold-tea apostle.
For many weeks he lectured in and out of Towns-
ville, in street and hall, with much ability and a
thorough mastery of the bill. At Charters
Towers he fairly played with Labor-member
Lesina in a set debate on the question of the hour.
Lesina, by the way, was about the one Q. Labor
anti-billite who worked tooth and nail for his con-
victions. He swore the bill was bad, and de-
nounced it frenziedly, but never in all his speeches
gave one lucid reason for his attitude. But that
was not his fault. The attitude couldn’t be ex-
plained by any sane reasoning.
Reckoning up to to-day (Saturday, 23rd
Sept.) the long-lived Ministries of Australasia
have been as follows :
Federal forecasts.—
Kington: The Federal
Parliament will meet
January 1, 1900 ;|Turner:

MAGDALEN-OR BANANA-SKIN.
DON JUAN, JUNR. (as a prominent member of
W. C. T. U. slips on the pavement): “ ’Ere y’are,
Bill, ’ere’s one of them fallen women as I was
a-tellin’ yer of.”
Theodore Fink was put up in the Yic.
Assembly the other night to express the Age’s
argument that the Eastern Cable co. should be
allowed to start a private office for sending cables,
and compete with the Govt, for business. For the
next half-hour the spectacle of Fink in the soup
was highly interesting. P.M.G. Duffy pointed
out how Australia had been exploited in the past
for the benefit of the cable cos., and Gillies and
Trenwith backed him up. In the end the syndi-
cate’s defender got out and got off, with fragments
of his broken plate adhering to him.
Queensland Govt, papers aver openly
again and again that the Scandinavians, Italians
and others are wanted to take the place of
kanakas on the plantations. Queensland Govt,
agents, however, trot round Europe talking to the
peasantry and telling little stories about vine-clad
cottages, snug little homesteads, every man his
own landlord, and so forth. The small Con-
tinental cultivator who comes to Queensland on
these representations and finds then that he is
expected to do kanaka work on kanaka condi-
tions, is going to get a rude awakening.
Most of the Queensland anti-federalist
journals have accepted their defeat quietly and
gracefully, and avow themselves prepared to take
the referendum verdict in good part. The labour
organs, seeing the stand taken by Q. democrats,
could, of course, scarcely do otherwise. The
bigoted, illiterate Telegraph, however, keeps on
howling and assuring the public it has a card up
its sleeve for the discomfiture of the federal party,
Brisbane is in a fix just now ; it doesn’t know
whether it ought to be more proud of its anti-
national vote or its anti-national newspaper.
Of what value is the pledge of a politician?
Thus Homburg, M.P., a leading Tory Opposi-
tionist in S.A. Assemby, 13th Sept., ’9B, speaking
on the Household Suffrage Bill:
The opinion of a large number of members in the
House was that the vote of the people would be against
the Bill in its present shape. (Mr. Batchelor: “Will
you be prepared to abide by the result of the poll?")
Most emphatically.— Hansard, 1898-9, page 470.
The result of the poll was a majority for House-
hold Suffrage of over 15,000 votes ; but, the other
day, when the second reading was carried, Hom-
burg voted against the Bill /
As the statement by Labor Member Law
that the Fegan Amendment was put into the
hands of five or six members to ensure its safety,
has never been contradicted, it is presumably
correct. If so it was a piece of Fegan.
J. Lionel Fegan first attracted notice in New-
castle as a Wesleyan local preacher—it was this
religious connection that enabled him to secure
nomination on the Labor ticket at the birth of
N.S.W. Labor Party in the’9l election. He threw
over the Solidarity Party for Reid just at the
right moment, and now deserts Reid in time to
secure a portfolio.
Rumors are revived that M.L, is “sick
of Seddonism,” and that the people will “shake
off the yoke ”in December next. It is in turn
insinuated that Seddon is sick of M.L. and will
seek the calm of the Agent-Generalship (whioh
Reeves, it is cabled, is resigning). Truth probably
lies between these extremes. The country shows
signs of “that tired feeling” simply through
having the same Ministry in office for
nine years; so does Dick. And little
wonder, for Seddon has been practically doing
all the work of the Ministry for six months,
while M‘Kenzie has been absent in England,
Thompson tending a sick wife, and Hall-Jones
rebutting “ scandals.”
- Sydney D.T.’s leader on the formation of
the Lyne Ministry was notable for its attitude
re B. R. Wise’s inclusion. The Telegraph loves
Wise as much as Reid does, and it is a bitter pill
to it that his inclusion is the prop of the Ministry,
in whose career the D.T. takes for the present a
friendly interest. The Telegraph is comforted
by the reflection that the Lyne Ministry contains
a “ strong Freetrade element ” —said element con-
sisting of B. R. Wise (whom the paper accused
last year of selling the country to Protection under
the mask of the Federalist Party) and Jno. L.
Fegan, whose tiscalism is of the very mildest
order.
The British Board of Trade presented a
report to the Imperial Parliament in 1849 recom-
mending one tariff for all Australia, however
many divisions it might split into. The Board
suggested that that tariff should, in the first
instance, be fixed by the Imperial Parliament, but
that the various Australian provinces should have
power to meet annually by representatives and
alter or confirm the tariff as they pleased. The
latter is practically what the Federation will now
do; but the Board of Trade at that remote period
pressed to have its recommendations made part of
the then discussed N.S. W. Constitution Act.
Brisbane Telegraph item (6th Sept.) :
The lying Billite spirit will presently say that the heavy
majority against the Convention Bill was in Brisbane
only.
Considering that there is, at time of writing, a
total majority of over 6200 for the Convention
Bill, and that North Queensland, Central Queens-
land, and South Queensland —outside Brisbane —
have all given majorities for it, and only Brisbane
district gave an anti-Federal majority—well, the
chances are that “the lying Billite spirit” wiU
say something of the kind. The average Billite,
unlike the three ex-parsons of Brisbane Tele-
graph, is a little particular about what he says.
The inclusion of W. H. Wood as Ministei
of Justice in the new N.S.W. Cabinet has greatly
angered the old Oppositionists who have long
fought against Parkes and Reid, and have been
passed over in the day of triumph for “a boy of
28.” The disappointed ones first alleged as the
reason of Wood’s appointment that he was Pre-
mier Lyne’s prospective son-in-law; but Lyne
warmly denied this, whereupon another and much
less creditable (not to say less credible) cause was
assigned. S.M. Herald must have got the tip,
for it named Wood as a certain member of the
Cabinet from the first. The why and the where-
fore of the selection is a mystery, for the new
Minister is prominent neither inside nor outside
the House.
A PERSECUTED KING OF THE RING.
The Vic. Freetraders have utterly re-
nounced their former organ, the Argus, and at
the annual Freetrade dinner went out of their
way to shy things at their erstwhile guide, philo-
sopher, and friend. Irvine, M.L.A., who owes
his seat in Parliament to the paper named, ridi-
culed the idea that Freetraders could accept a
compromise of a 20 per cent, maximum duty
to the outside world, as suggested by the
Argus. Following Irvine,- came Max Hirsch,
who burned with Freetrade indignation at
the very thought 'of a compromise, and
dubbed the Argus the “new Protectionist.”
Surely, he continued, it can be said with truth,
“The old Protectionists chastised us with whips,
but the new Protectionists chastise us with scor-
pions.” And the Argus actually gives pro-
minence to these remarks.

failing to relieve me, I made up my mind to try

in all about ten bottles, with the gratifying result
that I am perfectly cured. Thanks to Warner’s

Hundreds of people flocked to North Mel-
bourne the other night under the impression that
the district was in flames. As a matter of fact, the
alarm arose from a brilliant illumination at Fitz-
gerald Bros, drapery establishment, laid on to
advertise the opening out of the firm’s latest and
greatest stock of new Spring goods.*
When The Bulletin visited the Art
Furnishing Establishment of Messrs. A. Hall &
Co. (563-7 George-street, Sydney), and inspected
the wares there displayed, it was badly tempted
to rush off and promptly burn down its hereditary
castle in order that it might have the chance of
rebuilding and refurnishing “ from parapet to
basement ” with articles combining in such a high
degree, artistic design, beauty of finish, and solid
durability.*
Boss Booth, jun., of the Salvarmy, still
tries to squeeze the Westralian Govt, into grant-
ing more concessions for the proposed “ over-sea ”
colony at Collie —chief among them authority to
concentrate the improvements on the selections,
and also to have all the latter held in the name of
Booth, sen. But Westralia, after a sad experi-
ence of the big land-grabber, isn’t taking to him
so kindly as it did. By the way, considering the
splendid coal-deposits there are at Collie, the
drum-and-bonnet brigade appears to have shown
its usual hawk-like financial talent in its selection
of the proposed colony.

THIS Company is being formed for the purpose of acquiring and working a very valuable mining
property situated in the well-known mining centre of Maryborough, consisting of Lease No.
4308. The Lease comprises about one mile of McCallum’s Creek, Crngie, extending for a distance of
over 1000 yards on either bank. The creek itself averages about 30 yards in width. The Vendors are
negotiating for the adjoining property, which will be handed over to the Shareholders at cost.
The early history of these diggings, in which were the Emu, Cockatoo, Gibraltar, Talbot, and
several others, is sufficient inducement to investors to accept the genuineness of the proposition. The
ground has already been proved to contain very rich alluvial deposits, also many thousands of tons of
battery sand, which owing to the crude and primitive appliances used in former days, fully 30 to 40
percent, of the quicksilver and gold escaped into the creek, and there can be no doubt that a very
large portion of this could be easily recovered by a complete up-to-date and inexpensive plant.
The Directors visited the property and took a number of samples at random, and upon being
assayed by Messrs. Jaques Bros, the following result was obtained : 3dwts. 3grs. per ton, and this sand
was obtained at four feet above water level.
The plant to be erected on this property will be capable of treating72o tons per week at (say)only
2dwts., which is putting the return at the very lowest estimate, and would show profits as under :
RESULTS OF TWO MEN who were on the Lease pending flotation, obtained in a few weeks upwards of 201 b.
of quicksilver and amalgam, their appliances being merely long-handled shovels and a tub, some 51b. of same
being retorted produced 6dwt. of gold. This sample can lie seen at the Office of Messrs. Fry and Derham.
E. PRESTON, Esq. 423 b Little Collins-street.
Dear Sir.—l certify that I have treated the small parcel of mercury which you have handed to me weighing
2oz. 9dvvt. 10grs., which produced 3dwt. 15grs. of amalgam, and this yielded 2dwt. 14grs. retorted gold.

Reports are herewith appended from Mr. J. F. Jackson, Mining Manager (late Town Councillor of Alexandra),
Mr. J. H. Clark, Mr. W. 11. D. Hopton, and Mr. C. Smith.
Early application for shares is absolutely necessary, as a great number have already been applied for, and
priority of application will be strictly adhered to.
Reports of McCallum’s Creek Gold Recovery Syndicate’s Property.
MR. J. F. JACKSON’S (Mining Manager) REPORT.
The property consists of about 1000 yards in the basin of McCallum’s Creek, which lies at an average of about
10 feet below the banks, and on the sites of the following Diggings which have ceased working—viz., The Cockatoo,
Emu, and others. The bed of the creek has never been disturbed since working ceased. I have been intimately
connected with this property since its inception as a gold bearing proposition, and in my opinion a small, complete,
up-to-date plant is all that is required to prove it a highly remunerative investment.
Mr. J. H. CLARK’S REPORT.
E. PRESTON, Esq.—Dear Sir, —In reply to your letter in re McCallum’s Creek, I beg to report as follows I
have lived in the district of Talbot, Craigie and Majorca for the past 25 years, and am thoroughly aequaimed with
the property known as McCallum’s Creek. There were five batteries, viz., Johnston’s, Wallace & Greenway’s,
Hornby’s, Sear’s, and Malesky’s working, which crushed very rich dirt averaging something like 2ozs., and some as
high as 16ozs. to the load, and having worked there, it is within my experience that a large quantity of gold and
quicksilver (estimated at over 1 ton) escaped into the Creek. Of course the primitive and inefficient appliances in
vogue in the early days are responsible for this loss. There can be no doubt that the great bulk of this would be
easily recoverable by ordinary modern appliances. I consider your lease a very valuable one, possessing singular
natural advantages for dredging purposes.
As regards No. 2 Lease, now applied for, it would, in my opinion, prove a very desirable addition to the property
already acquired, as without any additional expenditure it could be easily and profitably worked. It contains the
bed of a stream known as the Back Creek, and portion of McCallum’s Creek, and adjoins the old workings of the
Talbot, Majorca, Gibraltar, and also other good diggings. The flat ground on the sides of the Back Creek should
prove exceedingly rich owing to the loss of amalgam from the several batteries crushing there, and which should be
easily obtained.
Mr. W. H. D. HOPTON’S REPORT.
In my opinion there can be no doubt that you have a most valuable lease, which need only be known to the
public to receive their consideration and response. The tailings from five batteries which worked on your Lease are
still in large quantities in the Creek and on the banks. From dish trials very satisfactory prospects were obtained.
The fact that thousands of tons of alluvial having been puddled at this Creek compels the belief that a great deal
of fine gold was lost and is still in the Creek. Further, the escape of quicksilver from the batteries, carrying with it
gold in quantities, has been proved to be a valuable asset. I have no doubt that a plant consisting of Centrifugal
Hydraulic Pumps, with Nozzles, Engine and Barge, &c , to work the property would very soon show a handsome
return.
Mr. C. SMITH’S REPORT.
E. PRESTON, Esq.—Dear Sir,—At your request I beg to hand you my report on your lease at MeCallum's
Creek. I worked in that district years ago. There had been five batteries working on that portion or the Creek for
many years, and crushing very rich stone. To my knowledge the owner of Finch’s Reef put through many tons of
stone that went 40ozs. to the ton, and the majority of the stone put through averaged 2 ozs., and it isa weil-known
fact that batteries in those days lost fully one-third of the gold. The No. 2 Lease you refer to, consisting of about
a mile and a quarter above your other lease, I remember when there was a succession of puddling machines working
there, and thousands of loads were puddled that went from 6 to 15 ozs. to the load, and the principal part of the
find gold went into the Creek, the greater portion of which must still be there now, and I consider that should you
acquire the second lease you would have two very valuable properties, that should oonnnand the attention of all
investors.
At Povery Point.
H. J. Samuels, the Sydney music-publisher, can furnish
melanch'oly evidence that, Melba wasn’t, a prophetess in
her own country. Some 14 years ago Samuels aforesaid
speculated in a shilling concert at the old A then aium
Hall, Melb. It was to be a mighty tine concert, for a
“bob’-Mrs. Palmer, Melba (then Nellie Mitchell), Broc-
col'in'i, Christie Fuller, and Frances Saville —but the rain
came down in torrents on the appointed night and only
26 people paid for admission. About the same number
of deadheads were also present at 8.15 p. m., when the
manager announced that the show was “ off, ’ and all
money would be returned at the doors. Whereupon the
audience made a rush for the available silver, and
Samuels presently found that the treasury was several
shillings to the bad, through deadheads collecting a
shilling apiece as they passed out.
Dear Bulletin.- Will you kindly inform us if Federa-
tion will make hats very much dearer ? I hope so. Also
caps suitable for night-wear, say going to parties or
plays. At present fashionable hats are so cheap that it
is a torture to go to any Sydney theatre. The first row
in the dress circle —most of them have large things like
washing-tubs stuck on top of them, and they shut out all
the view from anyone else. Stalls are just the same ; pay
your money and come away quite disgusted, informing
evervone you know “ I have been, but I did not see half
of it, as there was a lady sitting in front of me with
something on her head in the shape of horns.” There
was one woman the other night, in evening dress, with
something on her head—it looked to us like one of those
old-time Chinese hats. One man said it was not a woman,
but something fixed up to take a rise out of the people.
He could see over its shoulders only for those confounded
winkers being where the ears ought to be. Is there any
hope that Federation will make large hats ±lB 10s.

Musical critic J. F. Runciman, discoursing in the
Saturday Review on modern songs, holds that there are
no English songs worth singing. Of the six com-
posers he mentions as doing the most notable work in
this line, two are knowu in Australia. One is Clutsam,
whose book of songs is, he says, “ entirely German,” not
English in character. Of the other, Marshall Hall,
Runciman says that “ his only very fine songs are not
songs, but scenes.” Clearly there is a chance for a good
“ songsmith ” to distinguish himself.
“ Gallery-Man ” : Agnes Robertson (Mrs. Dion Bouci-
cault) tells in “M.A.P.” of how nervous she and Dion were
about the “Colleen Bawn’s ” first production in K.C.
Dublin on account of the staging for the first time of an
Irish priest. I was myself in the historic gallery of the
Dublin Royal on the first night. There was an enormous
house, and I have never since seen any dress-circle to
equal that one, for size, dress, and beauty that bore
examination with a microscope. The Lord-Lieutenant
(Carlisle) was present, and Boucicault sang a song with a
gag in it for His Ex. :
Oh, if I was Emperor of Roosia to command—
Julius Sayser, or the Lord-Liftenant of the Irish 1
The same day I had dropped in at a Dublin church when
Carlisle happened to be giving away Miss Grattan (grapd-
daughter of Henry) to Captain Esmonde, M.P., father of
Sir Thomas Esmonde, the Home-Ruler, who toured
Australia a few years ago. The celebrated Yelverton
marriage-case was on in Dublin when the “ Colleen
Bawn ” was produced there, and Mrs. B. relates that when
she came on as a winsome colleen, a gallery-boy saluted
her with “ Tu-tu ’’—Major Yelverton’s pet name for The-
resa Longworth.
In the recently-published (Oscar Wilde’s) “ Importance
of Being Earnest” (which is even more amusing to read
than to see on the stage), there is a cynical little passage
about Australia that is worth quoting. Cecily, the
heiress, tells her lover Algernon that her guardian wants
hitn to emigrate and is buying his outfit. “ I certainly
wouldn’t let Jack buy my outfit,” says Algernon ; “ he
has no taste in neckties.” Cecily: “ I don’t think you
will require neckties. Uncle Jack is sending you to Aus-
tralia.” Algernon : “ Australia ! I’d sooner die.” Cecily :
“Well, he said at dinner on Wednesday night that you
would have to choose between this world, the next, and
Australia.” Algernon: “Oh, well 1 The accounts I have
received of Australia and the next world are not particu-
larly encouraging. This world is good enough for me,
cousin Cecily.” Certainly Australia is no place for the
author of “ The Importance of Being Earnest.”
Billy Heffernan’s theatre is one of the memories of Old
Bendigo that will live. It was built in the days when the
digger whose head wasn’t too bad went with a hammer
and whipped out a pound or two of gold from the surface-
reefs and got back to breakfast. The “ show ” alongside
the Shamrock didn’t run continuously ; and when it did,
it consisted mostly of a star—one in tights and with hair
a-hanging down its back preferred. Yet the bill for per-
formers ran into something beyond £lO,OOO a year. Hef-
fernan was partnered in the gilded enterprise by John
Crowley ; the latter, however, kept his eye fixed chiefly
on the pub. next door, and, later on, also ioeally managed
Cobb and Co.’s then big business between Melb. and the
goldfields. More years ago than most people can remem-
ber, the partners divided their gold and went their sepa-
rate ways with several sackfulls. Crowley made af ew
attempts to live an old age of retirement; but they all
failed. Finally, he bought the Bendigo theatre, with its
neighboring block of pub. and shops and offices, and then
marked his retirement from the active management of
that by falling and breaking his thigh. It was too much
for a man a good way past 70 ; and so the goldfields lose
one who knew more about the rollicking side of the cham-
pagne days, and who coined more money out of the rol-
licks, than any of his survivors.
The funniest thing is to watch the darkie juggler of
M’Adoo’s Georgia Minstrels co. gravely balancing two
balls on a stick dla Cinquevalli. They are seemingly so
securely balanced that a vigorous shake is needed to dis-
lodge them, yet the performance isn’t intended for a
joke. An amusing travestie of Cinque’s great feat has
been given in England at times. The humorist, whose
previous tricks have commanded respect, puts the two
balls on the top of a billiard-cue and makes a great show
of carefulness in balancing the cue on his forehead. Then
he cautiously lowers it, accepts the applause of the audi-
ence, and casually holds the cue at an angle with the two
balls still sticking in position, just to show he was taking
a rise out of them.
Circus horses, says Dan Fitzgerald, must have some
“ blood ”in them, and a touch of vice is acceptable. The
vice is educated into mannerisms, which circus-people
call “ playful.” Pony Commodore, for- instance, would
be quite capable of chawing or kicking an incautious
admirer—but only in play.
The fine life-size photo, of Melba which stands in Mar-
chesi’s studio was given to her by her ex-pupil on the
understanding that she will bequeath it to the trustees
of Melbourne Art Gallery. The picture will then be a
souvenir of Victoria’s first famous singer and of the
Frenchwoman who “ made” her. Melba owes much to
Marchesi and precious little to her native city, anyhow.
In these days of Castles boom and senseless Bendigolatry
it seems almost incredible that Mrs. Armstrong, the real
original “ future Melba,” was considered fortunate to
realise £6O by her farewell benefit concert in Melbourne.
Tenor John Fuller, in his semi-amateur days, was in
great demand as a club singer in England. One corpora-
tion had him at many successive annual re-unions, and a
favorite song was one from the forgotten opera of
“ Matilda,” called “ The Crown, the Sceptre, and the
Sway." John got ashamed of it at last and introduced
new stuff, but they wanted the old favorite, so one old
gentleman got up to make the request public. He said,
“ Mr. Fuller, I must beg, on behalf of the company, for
that old song we all like so much— 1 The Clown, the
Spectre, and the Shave.’ ”
“ A sight of Amy Castles’ photo.—full face,” writes
“ Old Pro.” to The Bulletin, “ convinces me that she has
a future —in comic opera. Anyone studying the faces of
this class of artist must have noticed the ponderous jaws
and stubborn, pointed chins which give the face-outline
the appearance of a shovel. From Choctaw-princess May
Yohe ” (she told a London interviewer she was quarter-
bred Choctaw Indian), “to frowning Mabel Love, Holy
Hepner, and All-is-vanity Vane, they have the Dubberke
jaw and chin. The latter missed the ’bus in not going
on the stage, as she is the greatest actress of them all.
In fact, jaw seems a factor as potent in music as in mus-
cle. A certain male singer’s jaw casts so deep a shadow
on his neck that I really thought he had forgotten to
wash it.”
A Vic. paper Las a story of a cheerful thief who vic-
timised a cute mining-man during the progress of a con-
juring entertainment at Bendigo. At a wisely-chosen
moment a slim young man, with a clean collar and a
heavenly smile, slid along the best seats murmuring,
“Will any gentleman kindly lend the professor a gold
watch?" The mining man in question obliged with a
bulky timepiece worth about 60 guineas— well, there you
are I The watch and the young- gentleman with the
heavenly expression passed out by a side door and are
now long-felt wants in the local detective-office.
“Ancient”: The best-drawn character in “Lord
Quex ” is that of the old governor of Umbos, gay old dog
Sir Chichester Frayne. Consider how he takes off the
jaded old bucks you see every da} - in the private bars,
where they imagine they are rending with passion the
bosoms of the painted drink-slingers. The way he bends
forward and smirks, and throws out his chest and leers,
and curls one leg round the other, and narrowly escapes
blowing up with the conceit that he has ’em on a string.
And then, in the morning—when his liver has gone
crook—what a hideous lot they are then ! Yes, Chichester
Frayne, of Umbos, West Africa, is a masterpiece ; or else
Dartrey made him one, which amounts to the same
thing.
Celia Dainpier, the violinist, is the daughter of an
Auckland “ Cheap John "—the child of his old age. Old
Dampier’s reputation as a shrewd, keen trader in any-
thing and everything was not congruous with his phy-
siognomj', refined almost to the point of femininity.
Celia's mother, a black-eyed Irish colleen, won the old
man’s heart whilst acting as a saleswoman amongst his
“wonderful bargains.”
The “divine Sarah” once went to church, and was
surprised to hear the preacher denouncing herself as a
female demon sent from the modern Babylon to corrupt
the New World. Ere the day expired, the shepherd re-
ceived a little note :—“ My Dear Confrere, —Why attack
me so violently ? Actors ought not to be hard on one an-
other.—Sarah Bernhardt ’
A competition among touring co.’s in England, for the
best extract from a visitors’ book, was decided in favor
of the following “ Cooking—Good, but plain. Land-
lady—Ditto, ditto.” Amongst better ones, disqualified as
more or less traditional, was this (attributed to Charles
Brookfield): “ Quoth the Raven .”
“S.”: After seeing a good deal of the real nigger on
the variety stage, I conclude that he is only a fairly good
imitation of the white man who imitates the real nigger.
D. : Priests are very common in drama, and what
a good old man the dramatic priest always is ! I can’t
remember how many of them I have seen left in lonely
places with nice-looking girls, and not one has attempted
to kiss the girl. No matter how close she gets, his rever-
ence on the stage doesn’t even hug her, even as a lather.
Rev. Freeman Wills, brother of the late W. G. Wills,
has gone one better than parson Walters by writing a
play with no Bible in it. The recent successful stage
adaptation of Dickens’s “ Tale of Two Cities ” is the
work of Freeman Wills, who also paints a little and leads
his own rifle-corps into action at Hyde Park. As the
vicar of a London city parish, he doesn’t get overbur-
dened with religious duties, seemingly.
Incledon, a popular London actor early this century,
was jingoistic—while Napoleon threatened an invasion of
England—and astonished the Drury Lane performers in
“Hamlet,” at rehearsal one morning, with a speech:
“ How long are we going on with this twopenny-halfpenny
nonsense, with the very existence of England threat-
ened?” Then he went off to a review, and gave a little
boy threepence to carry his gun uphill.
The recent bull-and-lion encounter of Roubaix, France,
was not a “ fight” but a slaughter, as Leo wouldn’t come
up for the second round, and was thereupon ignomini-
ously slain by Taurus, who for his part only lost an ear.
The yells of the 14,000 spectators had probably much to
do with the unexpected result, as all the Leo family are
peculiarly susceptible to shouting.
The growth of the drama in the suburbs. “ What is
silver coin a legal tender for?” asked an assistant lately
in a suburban State school. “Please, sir,” said Willie
Woolvvash, “for th’ play at th’ Townorl.”
Robert Buchanan and Harriet Jay, joint authors of
that gloomy melodrama, “ Alone in London ” (or
some such title) have been putting their heads together
again. Their recent results are a French Revolution
story which Mrs. Langtry is staging regardless of expense,
and a new version of “The Heavenly Twins.” Judging
from the solid merit of the melodrama aforesaid, the part-
nership of Buchanan and Jay will produce a fine play
sooner or later.

LIPTON’S LATEST.
THE SHAMROCK IN NEW YORK.
Sib Thomas Lipton has had a good time in
America with the reporters, every one of whom to
a man —and a woman, too —thirsted to tell the
world all the secrets of the Shamrock’s construc-
tion ; all the inner particulars of the great mer-
chant’s tea trade; all the reasons which inspired
him with a desire to give Killarney to the Irish
people at a cost of <£50,000 to himself, and,
generally speaking, to bring to light everything
he desired to keep dark.
They made him talk whether he liked it or not,
and thus got some fearful and wonderful informa-
tion out of him. But when he had succeeded in
making Miss Gimlet, of the Herald, believe that
he shipped a hundred and seventeen thousand
chests of tea to Mesopotamia every year, and
when Miss Sharpset, of the World, laid before
her editor the full details of a breeding establish-
ment for Bactrian camels which he was supposed
to have located at Chiselhurst, they began to give
him a wide berth. All but Sarah Jane Screwby,
of the Mercury. She vowed to get the better of
him, and she is a very determined woman. Miss
Screwby is a severe lady, prim and angular ; per-
severing and inquisitive; impervious to satire,
and as shrewd as a loan-office manager.! She
fixed him with her cold, grey eye, and thus she
began:—
“Sir, you have grossly imposed upon two of
my colleagues. That is not the way to repay the
kindly interest the great American nation takes in
its visitors. Now, sir, you must not try to impose
upon me, but I will make a bargain with you. I
will tell you, sir, how to win the great yacht-race
you come here to contest if you will tell me truth-
fully what I desire to know about your yacht and
your trade.”
“ Done, madam,” he replied. “ Fire away.”
“ Sir, American ladies do not fire away ; they
goon ! Now, sir, if you want to win the yacht-
race, you supply your sailors, I’m told you have-
sixty, with plenty of Kupper’s Elberfeld Lager,
which is a strengthening, and stimulating, and
exhilarating beverage, perfectly wholesome and
good, made of pure malt and hops, and they will
win that race for you hands down. The British
sailor, sir, loves his beer, and that beer is the best
in the world.”

SPORTING NOTIONS.
JO3OOO, though a big price, is not too big for tbe
Cratrbrook-Tiwoona colt, Cranberry, w ith his prospects
ami engagements. It looks a “ moral ” that he will c<pinl
Amherite’s achievement of the year before last, ami win
the Caulfield Cup and the Melbourne Derby, a-top of the
N..8.W. blue ribbon ; and good jml yes believe that the
Melbourne Cup is well within his scope. It is supposed
that the purchaser (Wilson, of St. Albans) is acting for
the “English buyer” we have heard so much about
lately. Cranberry’s sale has stagnated betting on the
forthcominy biy events named, and brought worry to
many a plunging punter—for without information from
the right quarter there is no knowiny whether lie’ll yo
’Ome straiyhtway or see the tasks his late owner set him
throuyh. Cranberry's departure for Enyland would
briny yreat joy to the camp of the Ikeys, not oidy
because they have already laid heavily ayainst him, but
because his presence prevents dozens of others from com-
iny into the market. It must riot he foryottcn either
that Mr. Wilson owns Auric, already largely invested upon.
* * » •
By the sale of Cranberry Sydney loses
what it can ill-afford—a real racehorse. The hiy chest-
nut has only three races to his credit, but Sydney hasn’t
the nay that can ask him to yallop, at weiyht-for-aye.
Nothiny hut the worst of luck lost him the Mefrop.,
and nothiny but the same can lose him the V.R.C. Derby.
Cranberry is just the biy-hearted, honest trier to take
the place of old Carbine in the hearts of the public, and
if he doesn’t yo ahead and “ knock ” the records of most
latter-day champions, a heap of expert opinion will be all
wrong.
• * * •
Odds of 3 to 1 were laid “on ” Cranberry for
the Wycombe Stakes on the third day at Rand wick.
When round iny the turn, young Fielder appeared to he
hard at work on him, and the "books” threw up their hats
and bellowed “ The favorite’s beaten ! ” lint when called
on he simply ran over everything and won easily. Good
judges reckon Cranberry the most perfect galloper— when
at his top— they have ever seen. He veritably “ stretches
out like a greyhound extended, his girth laid riyht down
to the ground,” and he can be likened to nothing better
than a machine, he moves so trulv.
Next to Cranberry, the two most promising
performers at the recent Randwick Spring Meeting were
“ Jack ’’ Mayo’s Sequence, a biy hay by tbe imported Far
Niente, and the black Australian Peer three-year-old,
Australian Star. Roth snared a couple of races. Sequence
emphasising his party’s bad luck in bumpiny a nay like
record-breaker Djin Djtn in the Epsom, by winniny the
Shorts on the second day, and then gathering in the
weight-for-age Duff Memorial Stakes. Australian Star
is a hurricane finisher that promises to equal old Hop-
scotch as a champion “rniler,” and though neither he nor
Sequence are entered for the big Vic. events, it’s pretty
certain that they will, if asked, keep the so-called cracks
moving in some of the weight-for-age events.
• * * *
Of the other crack three-year-olds that performed
60 ingloripusly at recent Randwick meeting Parthian ap-
peared the most susceptible nf improvement, and per-
haps Mr. Long will do better with his team down South,
now that they are under a cloud, than when the public
were so prone to rush anything of the Chipping Norton
stable at the recent A.J.C. meeting. Mr. Long never did
care for the leavings of the public !
* ♦ * *
The jumping-races at Randwick were all well-
contested events, and apparently repeated press criti-
cisms have opened the eyes of some trainers to the
good things that awaited a decent “ lepper.” A few
months ago Sydney couldn’t boast a “steeple” horse
with enough pace to head a reasonably speedy bullock,
but the present lot are a very decent collection.
* • • «
Le Var has been backed for both Caulfield and
Melh. Cup, but his running in Randwick Plate last Satur-
day would seem to point to the Melh. Cup distance being
most to his liking. B.llappcais a light- impost for the
Lochiel horse after the “ 9st. odd ” he lias invariably been
burdened with for the last two seasons.

On one Sydney (illegal) tote, Cremona for the
Metrop. paid a div. of t3O 7s. (id. for every ss. invested on
her—odds of 140 to 1, or thereabouts. The books laid
33's and 50 to 1. “ Ikey ” wouldn’t lay 140 to 1 against
any nay on the dav of the race—not even if it had a
broken ley and was blind and dead, and scratched for the
event as well.
* * » «
The cheerfulness with which the average patron
of Randwick Leyerand flat swallows any “information ”
from the paddock, and planks his cash on it, is surprising.
In Randwick Leyer reserve the crowd collects along the
paddock railings, and frequently a “punter” conies
along, and pulls his nose or his ears, smacks his chest,
and otherwise ill-uses himself by way of signalling a tin
to a friend. The caller immediately rushes for the
ring, with the crowd sprinting after him to see w hat lie
books —and that nay has the cash piled on him. On the
first day of rect-nt Spring meeting, writer chased a friend
to ask him if the baby was any better, lost the friend,
and found that the crowd was following him. To yet
rid of them, asked a “ hook ” —“ What price Australian
Star?” which said crowd promptly rushed. But A.S.
won, and for the rest of the day this scribe was followed
altout by a “push,” that gathered round whenever he
put his humble “dollar” on, and followed his lead.
••* • *
“Gun”: Saw a strong thing at a Sydney
suburban course t’other day. Scratching-time passed;
6to 4 offered first favorite, 7to 1 next; only one in it,
all being right. Half-dozen punters hacked 7to 1 chance
heavily. The consternation among the Ikeys when a
little later they saw the 6 to 4 flier’s number drop out. may
be imagined. There’s a penalty for scratching late, and
there are supposed to he stewards. This writer never
heard of former being inflicted, nor of latter moving in
any way. As between backer and hook it is probably a
fair fight, for Ikey (t he wolf) frequently has a hot “ pot ”
in his hag, and why not punter (the lamb) now and
again? But how’ differently they take their gruel! The
wolf howls loudly and long, but the lamb treats it as a
matter of course—the game is played on him so often.

About the best-bred horse in V.R.C. Derby this
year is the Tasmanian colt The Sirdar, by Bill of Portland
from Martini-Henry’s full sister Wood-nymph (by Musket
—Sylvia). Martini-Henry was a maiden when he won
V.R.C. Derby, and a Tasmanian correspondent writes
that The Sirdar looks good enough to repeat the coup of
his distinguished relative.

Although Australian breeders have so far been
unable to raise a colt on Australian soil with a show in
the English Derby, it looks as if the day is not far distant
when, at all events, a young ’un sired by an Australian
horse will have a look-in. Amongst the 299 entries for
the 1901 Derby the sires Sir Mod red, Trenton, Carbine
and Carnage are represented, and such a quartet ought
to raise something pretty good.

A bill is now before Maoriland legislature to
kill the totalisator by the gradual extinction of licenses
for its use. Its author, teetotal Tommy Taylor,
raved to the effect that “ since the tote came
into existence the number of race-meetings have
not doubled or trebled, they have quadrupled.” As

before the tote came into existence) 164 race-meetings,

his interests ? And does the Tommy Taylor crowd «ant

A recent peculiar incident in connection with
W. A. consultations. A sweep was got up on Meuzies’
Cup, Aug. 31. The only starter, Speculation, had a walk-
over. The first money was 41(100, and the promoter
being puzzled wlmt to do with 2nd, 3rd, and 4th
prizes, as well as amount for starters, appealed to several
sporting authorities. Opinions were divided, but the
best advice begot, in this writer’s opinion, was to hand
the lot over to the drawer of Speculation’s number. Isn’t
this case unique in the sweep business?

“ Jack ” McGowan, the manliest and decentest
png. that ever broke a nose, made his last Australian ap-
pearance at Victoria Hall (Melbourne) last Saturday
evening, and is now on the briny with Bland lioit’s Co.
Jack has been out of fighting for six months, and the lest
seems to have done him a world of good. On Saturday
he faced “Tot ” Higgins, who offered to bet his weight
was only 9.8, but who looked a stone heavier. McGowan
was three inches shorter and only 9.4, and each man
entered the ring with a record of having gained and lost
one verdict over the other. The fight was a ralding ex-
hibition of science with enough blood and hair to satisfy
the most fastidious. Higgins scored at the outset, then
McGowan went in and landed Higgins’ head
till at the end of the fifth round he resembled
the “ horrible red man ” that correspondent Steevens
describes in “ With Kitchener to Khartoum.” For 15
rounds the little man landed lightning swings on
the other’s face, hut Higgins, with a bunged eye and
cuts on his lips, forehead, cheek and nose, seemed as
eager at die end of the 20th round as when lie opened.
The verdict was unquestionably to M’Gowan, and he had
certainly fought the best fight, of his life. He never gave
a chance, and his clinches to avoid hits were as pretty as
the hits of most men. When the verdict was given
M’Cowan’s chief barraeker, Walter Baker, howled with
elation, and the good-looking little pug. came forward to
make a farewell speech, wherein he eulogised Higgins for
his manly fighting. The crowd then called on Higgins
for a speech, and the beaten man leaned over the ropes
and said—“ The decision wasn’t a fair one ; that’s ail that
I can say." As the house hooted; he turned back,
“ Them as hoots,” he remarked, “can come into the ring
and I'll fight ’em, one after the other.”

Before this appears in print, the money will
probably be up and articles signed for a match (£lOO
a-side) at Yass, between C. Gorrick and C. Massev, for
the pigeon-shooting championship of N. S. Wales.
Massey recently won the title from a big field of cracks
at N.S.W. Gun Club meeting, killing 20 straight off ; but
Gorrick is no duffer, and will probably supple a stiff task
for Massey. The latter, as well as holding tiie'blue ribbon,
has to his name, amongst other feats, the grassing of 66
straight, and 92 out of 100 on the same day. Gorrick
beat Massey once in a 25-birds match—the’former, on
28yds., accounting for 24; and the latter, on 33yds..
for 23.

N.S.W. champion pro. swimmer, “Turns”
Cavill got home on Saturday last by the Orizaba after six
months’ absence in England and elsewhere. He told a
Bulletin man there was nothing in the game “down
under.” Anyone labelled “ from Australia” had the
field to himself. Percy Cavill would be champion of the
world if they’d give him a chance, but they won’t;
money-up doesn’t fetch a response. Little Freddy Lane’s
swimming was a revelation. The sport is pool)v‘patron-
ised by the public ; less than 200 saw the half-mile cham-
pionship swum at Southport. ” Turns” describes Jarvis,
England’s best amateur, who broke the 1000yds. world s
record recently, as a thick-set chap of only about sft. sin.,
but over 40in. round the chest. “What sort of man is
Greasley?” was asked by a listener. “Oh,” replied
Cavill, innocently, “only an ordinary-looking fellow,
something after your style.” Collapse of querist.
“Tunis” was in Paris for a while and says Australian
boys could make exhibitions of the French swimming
champions. He vows he'll never quit this little speck on
tiie globe again, and expresses himself as disgusted at
having expended so much time and energy to no purpose.
Swimmer Fred Lane still continues repeating
his best Australian form in a remarkable manner in Eng-
land. Cabled last week that lie shattered the British
“ fastest” for 300 yards at Blackpool, putting up 3mius.
47 4-ssecs.—t l-ssec. slower than his own world’s record
(3mins. 46 3-ssec.), established at Farmer’s Bath (Sydney)
on Feb. 4 of this year. Coupled with the fact
that, in Sydney late last season, Lane made
new figures for the furlong, and swam exactly
the same time when he won the English champion-
ship by 18 yards some weeks ago, it would seem that
there is very little in the notion that Australian athletic
form is injuriously affected by the English climate. Any-
how, the question of water temperature does not enter
into the matter as far as the two performances men-
tioned are concerned, both accomplished in tepid water—
if the writer is not mistaken.

After Fitzroy and South's final struggle, the
Melh. football premiership fell to the former. South was
beaten by one solitary point, after a game of the most
willing character. A pouring rain fell all the early pare
of the match, and most, of the tussle was a scramble in
the slush, but the players scrambled in a free, open and
plucky style, that, roused the ban-ackers to hysteria. The
game was played out to the bitter end ; men rolled and
tossed one anol her about with the vigor of a decade ago,
and stoush was dealt out on one or two occasions. The day
finished with Fitzroy 3 goals 9 behinds to South’s 3 goals
8 behinds, and the Southern supporters left the ground
calling the umpire a cow, and swearing that the last goal
was not kicked over the blanky mark. Fitzroy has now
to reply to the challenge of Footscra.v, the premiers of the
much-despised Association. If a meeting takes place,
every real sportsman ought to turn up and barrack for
the boys of the smellful suburb, for the League assumes
immense airs of superiority over the Association, and the
defeat of its elect would do a heap of good in attracting
public interest to the other body. But the Fitzrovs are
a machine-tike crowd, and Footscray, with the assistance
of all its hone-mills anti abattoirs, could scarcely put such
a “strong” combination in the field..

The last nine missionaries despatched from
Melbourne to China include a suburban grocer,
a country bank manager, and a crack footballer—
“Tugger” Hannah, who led Carlton club for several
seasons. After all there must be something in a faith
which can convert a grocer, a bank manager and a
footballer 1 Hannah will not find himself lonely in the
Flowery Land, for among the missionaries already there
is Joyce, the captain of the Fernside club of a few seasons
ago. Joyce is one of the cleverest, and pluckiest plavers
that Victoria ever saw, and though he was chased by
every senior club in Melb. he stuck to the second-rate
Fernsides on account of their Moral Influence. The Fern-
side Foolball Club ivns a wondrous institution, composed
of godly youth, who acted up to t.he tenets of their re-
ligion e'en in the hottest corners of the last quarter.
“ Laugwidge " of all sorts was forbidden by the Fernside
committee on pain of expulsion, and Fernside players
would pause in pursuit of the ball to rebuke an opponent
who said “ blanky.” Other clubs alleged that the Fern-
sides kicked off with prayer, and Imllocked with appro-
priate texts. Rut with the d purl tire of Joyce the death-
knell of Fernside was rune, and to-day its old ground is
occupied by a Paean club, which curses with picturesque
originality' and “deals out stoush ’’ when occasion
requires.

“Sport ” (Gympie) asks the question : “A bets
B that tlie Australians win ihe rubber in the recent test-
matches ; B bets A that the English would. Who wins
the wager?” And the answer is emphatically A. The
spirit of the waeer took the possibility, or rather t lie pro-
bability, of “ draws ” into consideration. A bet B that
the Australians woidd win a majority of the matches that
were not drawn. There was only one undrawn match,
and the Australians won it. It was just as much a win-
ning of the rubber for bet purposes as if they had beaten
the Englishmen every time.

Dear Bulletin. —Paragraphist “ Cricket ” is
flying in the face of history when he asserts that,
“Barring wet weather, or an unusual collapse, no test
match (in England) can be finished in three days.’’ One
of the recent five tests was actually finished ; another
would have been finished, with half a day to spare, but
for the rain, and it was only the slow hatting of the Aus-
tralians that prevented them winning the first test.
In days of yore, when the Australians were weaker in
batting and the All-Englanders st-Oroger in howling,
test matches were almost invariably finished within the
allotted time (weather permitting), though the wicket
may sometimes have been as hard as “Cricket’s ’’ head.
A “collapse’’— i.e., the defeat—of the Australians was
then the usual result. Trott’s 1896 team was the first to
win a test match on a batsman’s wicket in England. The
trouble this time has been (hat both sides beat, the bowl-
ing, as a rule, but a Richardson (at his best) would have
managed to win the game for either side within three
days. After the second game it looked as though Jones
might continue to vanquish the Englishmen. Jones,
howevc-r, seemed to go “ off ” as the English batting came
“ on,” and in the last two tests, anyway, each team mas-
tered the other’s bowling. With Jones doing his deadliest
for the Australians, and a Richardson or even a Peel
doing likewise for All England, a match would rarely be
left drawn on the third day.—F.

Touching the comparatively barbaric state of
sporting show-grounds in England—the present Austra-
lian team complains that a shower-bath in the dressing-
room is the exception, rather than the rule, and the only
alternative is a sponge and a basin. Probably no senior
club in Australia is without a shower-bath in its pavilion.

Among the “ crack ” English batsmen who
have tailed miserably against Australian bowling this
season, old W. Gunn seems to have failed miserablest.

Admitting that England has half-a-dozen capital
batsmen for every one that Australia can show at present,
the case of Albert Trott proves clearly the weakness of
English cricket. Albert, the ex-Australian, goes to the
country which is still the champion hatting country, and
proves himself to be its best “all-round ” man.

Probably one reason why Victor 'Trnmper has
not done as well in England as he might is that he has
been putting in several hours an evening as correspon-
dent for the management. Applications for free tickets
to the matches and to the Australian rooms on every
ground have been swarming in from all sorts and condi-
tions of people, and to the bulk of these requests
Trumper has had to return a polite refusal—a heavy item
in work to which he should not have been put. A man
cannot put in the night with the pen and play his best
next day.

The trouble between the cycling bodies of Vic.
and N.S.W. promises some interesting developments.
The recent decision of the N.S.W. League to have an
amateur section was as the fat in the fire, and the N.S.W.
Cyclists Union, afraid of being undermined, called a con-
ference of amateur associations at which it was decided
that those organisations alone should control amateurism,
thus leaving the League and its amateur-scheme out in
the cold. The Vic. League made things worse by inti-
mating that it purposed recognising the Cyclists’ Union
as controlling N.S.W. amateur cycling ; whereupon the
N.S.W. League charged Vic. professionals with a breach
of the reciprocity agreement„and claimed the £lOO for-
feit provided for bv said compact. During the slang
whanging the N.S.W. C.U. charged the N.S.W. League
with having boasted, when first formed, that it intended
to wipe out the amateurs altogether, whereupon the
League retorted that 12 months back, when the League
was supposed to lie moribund, the amateurs altered their
constituuon so as to embrace professionalism and thus
swallow the League; a little dodge which failed in-
glorious]}’.

and was third in semi-final and final of the latter. In the
10(» kilometres world championship Gondson finished 2nd,
four miles behind Nelson, and got third position with
Caldow (Scotland) in the tandem pursuit race (five miles)
less than 16 secs, away from the winner. The Canadian
press generally thought the Australian should have done
better, and most followers of the game in these parts will
agree with the opinion.

The late Torn Sparkes’ first big fight was with
“ liungaree” (Gorrick) at B itany in ’46, when Tom was
so much of a youth that, as the pugs, shaped up, yells
arose of “Take the boy home!” They changed their
tune a little later. The “boy” got through over 60
savage rounds, and though the referee eventually decided
against Sparkes on an alleged foul, Gorrick himself
admitted afterwards that the decision was wrong.
Another big fight was Tom’s 94 fierce rounds with King
at White Gum Hollow (N.S.W.), Sparkes being worsted.

way or the otln r from the proper direction will result in
injury to the bird wearing them. Tom, alter fixing
the spurs, used to look along them much as a billiard-
payer looks down his cue. The mains in quesiion were
of regular occurience every few months and took the
ostensible form of steamer-picnics. Many hundreds of
pounds were lost and w,,n on them.

“ C. .T.” : Lured by the glowing accounts of fear-
some snaps in “ Sporting NHions” I went down to the
Gjlden Gate Club in fear and trembling, expecting to see
something about lb times more terrible than ever hap-
pened in a Roman arena. The door of the dread place
was surrounded by a crowd of spitting, straw-hatted,
tired-looking young bucks. On the step a fair young
man earnestly abjured everybody to get a good seat
before the crush came. Prices, Is., 2s. and 3s. The en-
trance is through a long, narrow pas-age in which flaring
gas-lights maintain the idea that something important is
waiting at the otller end. Arrived at the other end,
there was a feeling of relief when a polite young man
asked to see my ticket, arid sought out the most com-
fortable seat in the division, and hoped I would enjoy
the show. The G.G.A.C. is a ramshackle, tumble-down
sort of barn with a gable roof of corrugated iron, in
which are four sky lights. Eight gas-lights struggled to
p’erce the rollingcloudsof tobacco-smoke. Two musicians
d s oursed mu-icon piano and \iolin. In tlieeentre is the
‘ ring,” a square space surrounded by two strong ropes
stretched from four corner posts. The seals immediately
around it are the stalls —two rows of forms without hacks
or cushions. On one side, the southern, is the d.c., a
raised platform about 3ft. high, furnished with old-
fashioned kitchen chairs, the ones with the backs adorned
with a red apple and two nondescript leaves. The wall
behind those chairs is dadoed with lurid chintz and
decorated with portraits of pugs in war-paint, and a
picture of a bygone scrap. The pit occupies all the rest of
the building and consists of tiers of plain boards that rise
to the very roof. Suddenly two apparitions, clad only in
bathing trunks, dirty socks and tennis shoes got into the
ring and sal down in their corners. Then came a
peremptory order to put out all pipes, cigarettes and
“stinkers” (presum ably alleged cigars). The appari-
tions rose up and danced round each oilier twirling their
hands. After an exhausting' exhibition of this, the Surrey-
Tlls Slaughterer stamped his right foot ferociously and the
Darlington Digger (led round the ring three times in a
stale of abject terror. Then the gong sounded and they
sank down in their corners and hung iheir paws over the
ropes, while henchmen waved towels, and two dirty dogs
blew mouthfuls of water over them. It, reminded me of
the Chinese cooks making iced cakes. The gong sounded
again, and they bobbed round some more and twirled
their hands in a manner that was awful to see, till sud-
denly, without warning, the Digger stamped his left foot
savagely and the Slaughterer tied round the ring 2£
times in a state of intense dread. The excitement became
terrific, and the audience howled itself hoarse while the
Slaughterer got in his leg-work. Then the gong again.
More towel work —and it was work, the towel men earn
their bit. The pugs, faced each other more cautiously
next tune, and the house held its breath, and the
Slaughterer walked round twirling his hands fiercely.
The Digger looked pale, ceased to twirl his fists,
and contented himself by stamping both feet when-
ever the Slaughterer came too near. Suddenly the
Digger sprang in and smote the Slaughterer right
on the boxing-gloves. It was a serious blow,
and the house gasped. Then the Slaughterer
rushed in close and gave the Digger a considerable bash.
Gong! The towels waved. The two combatants
were honorably spat upon by their seconds, and
the next round was due. But there was delay, consulta-
tion, hesitation, and then it was announced that the
Slaughterer had thrown up the sponge—knocked out by
the i wirling of his hands. There were no ears ripped off,
no sprinkling of sand to soak tip the gore, and all eternity
seemed to roll between the (Jolisamm and the Golden
Gate. There are more gore and brains to lie seen in
any ordinary street scrap any day. Several other alleged
contests were on the bill, but I had seen enough.

Some people denounce the “off -theory” as the
reason why test-matches are left unfinished al the end of
three days, and cricket in general is a slower business
than when the first object of bowling was to hit the
stumps. On the other hand, the theorists maintain that
howling which is calculated to miss the wicket is essen-
tial to file occasional success of a direct attack. The
modern batsman must he taken by surprise if he is to
be taken at all, as far as his slumps are concerned,
or he must he lured by strange devices into giving
the field a chance. Probably the expert and the inexpert
are equally foolish in Iheir contentions. Long before the
advent of “ off theory ” there was an outcry in England
for an increase in the height and width of wickets. Bats-
men were said to he healing the howlers. Then the
Australian Elevens put new life info the game fora time.
Batsmen ceased to have too much the best of it. Spof-
forth, Boyle and George Palmer were already waning
lights, and the hat was going very strong again before
the “off theory” came into full force. It has remained
in force. As to whether it was really more effective at the
outset than it is nowadays nobody can say for certain,
inasmuch as nobody knows whether the new batsmen are
superior to the fellows of 15 years ago and would have
been capable of punishing the old bowlers more severely
than they wallop Trumble, llearne and co. One thing is
certain—the arrival of the “off theory” made no per-
ceptible difference to W. G. Grace’s average. Tub
Bt i.lktix has no profound faith in any howling but the
very fast stuff, which no batsmen can “ place” carefully,
and which mostly scatters the bails if it gets past his
hat. The Richardson-Jones theory defies criticism when
put into practice by a man of Richardson-Jones ability.
The only possible better theories have yet to be dis-
covered by some Cinquevalli of the future.

Mr. Horatio Bottouiley’s new scheme is the
Aesociated Consols, to take over the Associated Southern,
K.W. Associated, and Auxiliary Associated, the total
capital of which amounted to over a million. Whenever
writer enquired about any of these mines on the field,
the usual reply was—“ Not worth a rap.” Boltomle.v has
been for the last two years booming them in his joint-
stock circulars, with the result that scrip came down to
2s. 6d. each. Now the game is to put all these “ cats ”in

London Ckitic, after quoting extracts from a
glowing report by the manager of the Auxiliary Asso-
ciated about the richness of the lodes, remarks that
“ such a report will certainly come as a surprise to Kal-
goorlie people, and especially to the miners working on
the North Zealandia and other leases named.” All these
leases were lately closed down, and it is well-known that
Bottoinley originally bought them very cheaply indeed.
The Great Boulder returns are to be published
monthly in future instead of fortnightly as heretofore,
bringing it into line with the surrounding mines. The
latest is that rich gold has been pierced by the bore at
900 ft. Three weeks ago it was given out that a similar
strike had been made at 800 ft. Jt is certainly a good
sign, but cannot be taken as absolute proof of either rich-
ness or permanency. Anyhow a bore only proves a few
inches of ground—and one of the easiest things in the
world to “salt” is a bore.

An Australian-in-China to The Bulletin
China is turning out a dismal mining failure, except per-
haps Mongolia, where there is a little gold. All tlie coal
measures are proving small and very faulty. As a rule
the seams are on edge, while the reputed rich lodes of
copper and silver have not. yet been discovered. In March
last gold was found at Wei-llai-Wei. Four Australians
went to the god-forsaken spot, and, locating a likely-look-
ing granite-quartz formation, applied to the Admiral for
mining l ights. They were told to produce certificates of
good character, and after obtaining these documents the
Admiral said lie would allow no one to work gold near the
Port, as the discovery of a payable lead would attract bad
characters to the place. Bill Adams, late of Broken Hill
and Coolgardie, has given up the Pritchard Morgan syn-
dicate, and i now mining-expert extraordinary to the
King of Corea. Hoover, late manager of the Sons of
Gwalia (W.A.), and Wilson, of Bewick, Morcimr, and Co.,
are exploring in Mongolia for British people. George
Kingswell, late of Coolgardie, has bought Shanghai Daily
Pbksk, and celebrated his first, week's occupation by
receiving four writs for libel.
The Amoor River, which separates the Chinese
from the Russian Empire, contains in its bed an incal-
culable amount of gold. An Australian, who recently
went miles up the huge stream, estimates that
190,009 Coolies live by hand-dredging. The Russians,
however, will allow no Englishman to work a dredge, and
so the country is absolutely closed.

Westralian Govt, is pretty well bled in the
shape of subsidies to medicine-shops (sometimes thinly
disguised as hospitals) and medical funds. It pays even
where wealthy companies—as on the goldfields and at the
timber-mills—might be expected to part a trifle. At latest,
the Collie-Wallsend miners had got a promise of Govt. £
for £ for their fund ; and so the co. is still further relieved
—it doesn’t contribute a cent.
It is customary for Q. Govt, (writes a miner to
Tim Bullktin) to send geologists to examine those
mineral districts which are thinly populated by the miner
on his “ own.” Then, after months, or perhaps years, is
published a report, which the man trying to "make a
living on the spot will be lucky to see at all, and even
then the technicalities in which it abounds make it nearly
useless to him. Also the g.g.’s, although quite willing to
accept information about outcrops, dykes, lodes, &c.,
rarely, in return, even so much as name the rocks from
which they take their specimens. They should be in-
structed to give a short lecture in each camp, describing
the leading geological features of the neighbourhood in
plain language. The time would be regained in the
future, through the miners being more competent to
supply necessary data.

Broken Hill miners believe nothing more firmly
than that bad accidents run in threes : and scores of cases
in.support arc remembered. No serious mishap occurs
but bosses and men alike look out for the others—and
therein, probably, lies the explanation. Miners are often
blamed by cocksure newspaper correspondents and others
for heedlessness : it is a commoner experience that they
get into trouble when they become Hdgetty. In some
parts of the world (for the creed is pretty general among
miners) work is either temporarily suspended after a bad
accident or scores of men take leave. Another explana-
tion, however, is that climatic changes (and they are
very sudden and-very severe at Broken Hill) have most
to do with falls of earth, which are responsible for most
accidents underground.

Westralian Gov. Jerry Smith made his first
appearance as a mining reporter at the l’eak Hill meeting
in London, a column-long letter, ostensibly to his dear
friend Darlington Simpson, being read, llis Ex. talks the
“ expert’s ” language as if he hail years of experience in
it, concluding with a reference to the “excellent
staff ” and the “ brilliant prospects ” about to be “ abun-
dantly fulfilled.” Of Gov. Smith’s predecessors at Aus-
tralian Guvmentoiises, Kintore probably made the biggest
mining pot—the Horns steered him into Broken Hill in the
early days ; and he is still a shareholder in several mines,
and chairman of the Sulphide Corporation. .1. 11. Smith,
whom South Australia imported as Chief Railway Com-
missioner in the boom days, is, by the way, secretary to
this co.

The latest copper statistics by mail nay be sig-
nificant. At the end of July there were 33,019 tons of the
metal in stock in England ami France and on the water
—a greater quantity than at any time since Nov., it<97.
Chili and “ countries unspecified ” sent nearly 7000 tons,
as against an average of 3000 tons during the last couple
of years.

N.S. Wales mining seems still suffering from
“want of capital.” Scores of plaoes are trying to raise
capital instead of ore. Writer lately asked one man what
was the size and value of his lode. “ Well, she is 6ft.
wide all through, and will go 60 per cent, of copper.”
“What are you going to do with her?” “ Well, 1 only
want capital to develop her 11”
The lustrous-eyed Henrietta Watson kept her nuptials
verv quiet for one so prominently before the public, i hree
weeks elapsimr ere the fact was published. The menu nt
recalls how Henrietta used to spoof certain soulful young
llelb scribes before she returned to England. “1 "ill
never marry," she told one of these credulous youths
three years'aeo ;“1 am wedded to my art. It is all I
love. ‘My whole life is devoted,” etc., etc. The beau-
teous Watson's soft tongue was obviously in her pretty
cheek at the time. A girl with such eyes and shoulders
was never meant for celibacy.
“Oliver Bainbridge,” the long-haired N.S.W. fletionist,
was last heard of at Auckland narrating his experiences
in Russian dungeons - faked for the occasion. There
appears to have been a lack of attractive versimilitude
about Oliver's knouts and vermin, for even the innocent
local press vented doubts of their reality. It appears,
also, that Oliver had travelled in France, India, and
Turkey—in his dreams ; and his blackboard sketches
were much admired. The gentleman is full of cleverness
and cheek.

Cliffs, was granted to James Mooney.’’ Talked of going

wisely decided to make the best of this side.
Launceston (Tas.) aldermen propose to pass a by-law

Maggie Stirling, who went ’Ome more for the benefit
of her health and to pick up new songs and “ wrinkles,”
than with the idea of making money by the trip, seems to
have been encouraged to stay awhile. She sang at the
Duke of Westminster’s and other high-toned houses dur-
ing the London season, and when last heard from she had.
arranged to stay with Lady Darrell in September and go
to Paris in October to study, perhaps, tinder Marchesi.
It is late in the day for Maggie Stirling to attempt any
considerable improvement of her line, mellow mezzo
voice, lmt she will hear what the mighty Madame lias to
say about the matter, anyhow.
In a Tasmanian mining township theatre, the other
nigtit, a local identity with vine-leaves in his hair rose in
the middle of the performance and passed various more
or less witty remarks on the play and the players.
The audience smiled and the management sw ore softly.
A policeman was appealed to. “More than 1 dare do,”
he replied. “If I shifted the old chap I’d lie the most
unpopular man in the force. Everybody knows him.
Lave him alone.” The ancient persisted in his beery
interjections. The doorkeeper suddenly remembered a
time-honored plan. Elbowing his way to the interrupter
he whispered smilingly, “ Comeanavadrink ! ” The old
chap slowly turned a fishy eye upon the inviter and said,
as lie hauled a whisky bottle from his shirt, “No (hie)
fear; have one (hit:) with me ! ” So he stayed and inter-
jected and the hobby looked the other way. The affluent
old inhabitant can do pretty well as lie pleases in Tassy.
An ex-telegraph man writes:—“At Her Majesty's
(Sydney) the telegraphing in ‘ Secret Service ’ was a sight
for the gods. When the instrument clangs the receiving
clerk immediately starts to write ata frantic rate, whereas
he should first let Hie man who is calling know that he is
in attendance. Apparently the sender rushes to his key
and starts his message to headquarters without troubling
if there is anybody in attendance to take it down, and
does nor know if lie is clicking to the winds or to an
operator till the receiver suddenly stops him and by a
thump of his key signifies that lie has had enough. The
proper procedure is as follows : —Sender calls headquarters
with its telegraphic call, which may be HQ ; lie simply
bangs away HQ, HQ. IIQ, I IQ, HQ, till the mail at head-
quarters replies ‘ HQ lieie,’ and in war-time a special pass-
word acknowledgment. Then lie sends liis message,
and when it is finished gives the signal, ‘ end of message,’
and tlie receiver (the man at HQ) acknowledges tile
receipt by giving the number of the message. The process
as done at Her Majesty’s is like a man ringing his tele-
phone -bell and immediately starting to talk without
knowing if the party he wants to speak to is at the tele-
phone or down the street watching a dog-fight. Also,
the operators at Her Majesty’s read by sound, and in the
days of Jeff Davis they read by tape alone. Sound-reading
has not been in vogue more than twenty years or so.
The actual telegraphing seemed to lie a mere jumble of
dots and dashes—only heard one real signal given, that
of the repeat when tlie spy, Thorne, broke off in the
middle of 1 1 is message. It was genuine.

Dear Bulletin. —Be J. C. L. Fitzpatrick,
M.P’s much-reprinted joke about tlie N.S.W.
“Liquidarity” party. Jt is a first-rate joke. I
always thought so. I thought so when I first sent
it in to you in ’95, and I was confirmed in my
opinion when you printed not only that, but
several variants of it of mine, subsequently in ’9B
and dune, ’99. I am even more confirmed than
ever in that belief now that, it has come back to
its original home, your columns, after many days,
m the shape of a quotation from Hansard. It
supports my theory that if a smart par or two
could be successfully lifted from The Bulletin
into a Parliamentary speech, it would make a
Parliamentary reputation. Please turn the lime-
light, off J. C. L. Fitzpatrick and put the same on

Premier Reid’s final press interview was
reserved for the S.M. Herald reporter. He con-
sidered himself at that point, lie said, absolved
from dealing impartially with the various sections
of tlie press. Up till then G.11.R. had distributed
Cabinet and Ministerial morsels without regard
to editorial friend or foe. Which recalls that
during Dibbs’Premiership, the turbulent-tempered
one fell out with Sydney D.T., and was accessible
only to the Herald reporter. One day the I).T.
inm slipped into the Chief Secretary’s presence
unknown to the usually-vigilant usher, and found
Dibbs, short-sighted at best, enveloped in clouds
of tobacco smoke. “Take this down as fast as
you like before the other fellows (Ministers, pre-
sumably) come in ” —and with averted head
Darnellicago ” fired off a column or two of im-
portant copy. Then—“ Now, I think you’ve pot
enough. Don’t bother me for a week.” The
reporter escaped hurriedly unrecognised. Just as
the Cabinet gathered, the Herald man was
announced. “ Tell him lie's got all lie’ll get
to-day. r i here’s nothing for him. Thunder ! how
much more docs he want?” Next morning—ye
gods! ° J
Ex-Premier Hugh Nelson, of Queensland,
in a recent interview :
“ The House has a right to take whatever course it
deems best, ami to judge for itself whether Die referen-
dum indicates the real consensus of opinion of tlie people
of Queensland,”
M hich is presumably Hugh’s way of dropping a
hint of possible shady doings to come. Yet, when
the House asked the people to express their
opinion on the Federation Bill, and they expressed
it by a very solid majority, the House has no right
to start judging whether the opinion which the
people have expressed is the people’s opinion or
not. Hugh Nelson might as well say that the
House lias a right to judge for itself whether
Hugh Nelson is Hugh Nelson or not—with the
natural inference that it has the right to decide,
if it likes, that Hugh Nelson is not Hugh Nelson.
The Great Open-Window Question.
A medical man writes to The Bulletin :
The protest of semi-stifled railway travellers is at last
beginning to make itself heard above the rattle of depart-
mental wheels in many land&and continental legislation
is moving to a sanitary end in this respect. The ventila-
tion of railway carriages will make a point for considera-
tion by a Federal Parliament. Linder present conditions,
the average carriage, especially on country lines, is a
breeding-ground for many varieties of serious disease, and,
apart from all question of convenience, the menace to the
public health is a serious one. A normal adult lakes, on
an average, 17 breaths per minute, using 30'5 cubic
inches air on each occasion. By “using” is meant
that he withdraws from it a portion of its oxygen, and
adds carbonic acid, water, and certain foul organic sub-
stances. Such air may he re-breathed, hut acts injuri-
ously if not replaced after a short period. For health
the average adult requires 3000 cubic feet of air per hour
— i.c., the complete changing of the air of a receptacle of
1000 cubic feet three times per hour. This change will
not produce an appreciable draught, hut any number of
changes over five per hour under these conditions will do
so. Under English law, a minimum of -240 cubic feet of
space is allowed per adult head in common lodging-
houses, and 300 in workhouses —an altogether inade
quote amount. The railway authorities go a little further.
Taking a flagrant example, many country lines in
N.S. W. and Victoria are supplied with a class of fully
compartmented carriage, each division of which will
seat 8 persons when full. The first-class divisions each
contain about 315 cubic feet of space, the second class
230, giving an average of 39 and 35 cubic feet per head
respectively in a full carriage. For ventilation, six win-
dows may he opened—two in some varieties of carriage-
yielding in the former case 18 sq. feet of draught area.
With the door open a surface of about 20ft. is given.
Now, four adults will theoretically breathe over the en-
tire stock of air in such a carriage with the windows
closed, in about 35 min., but air is not such an easily-
managed medium as most persons suppose. Asa matter
of fact they will re-breathe one portion of the air several
times and will vitiate the remainder with the products of
respiration. On country lines, the intervals between
stations are often lengthy, and in half-an-hour a pois li-
ons atmosphere can he produced which is eminently
calculated for the convenience of the bacterial legacies of
former voyagers. To obtain the normal 3000 cubic feet
per hour for each individual it would be necessarj to
renew the air nearly 80 times per hour-and a renewal of
even ten times per hour in a space of 300 nq. feel produces
a violent draught! The window-area would effect this,
hut the resulting gale with a train travelling at an average
rate of speed would do nearly as much damage as the
slow suffocation.
An extreme instance has perhaps been selected, but it
affords a good object-lesson.- The hogie-car seating 00
people gives some 06 cubic feet per head, and a ven-
tilating area of about 101 sq. feet. On suburban and main
lines the compartment-carriages are somewhat larger and
possess overbead-ventilaLors, but even they are altogether
inadequately fitted for proper ventilation. The winter
traveller has in all of them a choice of two evils. By
closing floors and windows he speedily creates a poisonous
atmosphere, loaded with injurious matter. By opening
a window he admits a strong draught to flow over his
chest and face while the rest of his body remains in
the stratum of moist, organically-laden air, with occa-
sional interludes of freezing gusts when the floor is
opened. By allowing for a carriage full of excursionists,
on a winter night, the picture can be colored to a proper
hue of horror.
A German scientist recently experimented on guinea-
pigs by injecting a solution of the dust from railway car-
riages. In every case the animal died with symptoms of
tubercle or acute septicaemia. The warm, moisture-laden
atmosphere, filled with the foul organic products of
respiration, with loose skin-cells, and the other bye-pro-
ducts of human combustion, makes an admirable culture-
ground for all forms of bacteria. Tubercle spores flourish
in it, the coccus of pneumonia needs no better environ-
ment, and the sporules of many skin-diseases luxuriate.
Dried pus-cells (capable of producing tonsilitis), fungi
There is no need to continue the list.
Several inventions hare been brought forward to re-
move the evil, hut the authorities are. indolent. With
the forward rush of the train and the engine furnace
always at hand, a system of air-currents, warmed in
winter and cooler! in summer, should he easily avail-
able, and although the full amount required might be
difficult to supply with comfort, present conditions
would be much alleviated. Of the dust - collecting
qualities of the average carriage, and the absolute lack of
cleanliness in those who are sarcastically termed “car-
riage-cleaners,” it is unnecessary to speak. At present
the long-distance traveller will do best by sitting with
his hack to the engine, opening two opposite windows,
or a window and a ventilator, to produce a through
draught, and by making an outcry on every possible
occasion. For the suburban victim, a bicycle or the tram
will give a better chance of seeing Federation accom-
plished.
Within the last 10 years the North German
Lloyd S.S. Co. has built 51 steamers, and has now
building 14, all twin-screw boats of heavy ton-
nage ; one being a 14,000-ton vessel, intended to
beat, with a speed, the Kaiser Wilhelm
der Grosse’s ocean-average record of 22i. The
capital of the co.—lo years ago, .£1,500,000 —is
now £5,600,000.
Big John Forrest’s Redistribution of Seats
Bill promises considerable changes in W.A. The
North, which used to have seven members for its
huge wastes and its struggling droves of cattle, is
reduced to four. Perth and its surroundings are
increased from four members to seven. Kalgoorlie
and the surrounding goldfields are to have ten
members instead of six, and there are other re-
arrangements. There is considerable smash
among the two-men-and-a-dog constituencies
which used to return the sound old ’Gropers to
Parliament —though Forrest has alleviated the
smash as much as possible. Also the electoral
qualification has been made a trifle easier. Alto-
gether the Six Families are likely to be much
smaller tin gods in the first Parliament elected
under the new law than in any ’Groper Legislature
up to date. But when that Parliament will be
elected is something of a mystery. There are no
signs of red-hot haste about John.
A Brisbane correspondent:—
Re Barton's mobbing in Brisbane, the other day, none
of the newspapers refer to the spirit Toby displayed in
the row. I was close to him, and noticed that he could
use his fists to some purpose. No funk, though much
ire.
An ex-Brisbaneite writes mournfully
liome from Paraguay re his troubles in Lane’s
Paradise. It seems the Brisbaneite got on splen-
didly until he was seized with the mad ambition
of raising a fat pig—inasmuch as he and his family
were suffering severely from want of meat. No
objection was raised (so deponent avers) so long as
the pig was small and lean, but as soon as the
porker waxed fat and substantial on private care
and nourishment, the Communistic Dictator
stepped in and claimed the swine as communal
property. Result—a quarrel and expulsion from
Cosine of two genial ex-Queenslanders. The
trouble with Lane is his ideals. He’d sacrifice
his mother to his ideal, but he hasn't any respect
for other folk’s ideals. “Another ground of
variance arose over the thrift question. One or two
of the settlers, in place of consuming all the g- ods
to which they were entitled, preferred to allow a
certain pro|x>rtion of their earnings to accumulate
in credit-dollars at the store. After a while, an
outcry was raised that these individuals were
becoming capitalists by virtue of their credit, and
a demand was made that their hoards should be
given up for the common welfare. Refusal and
ructions ensued. . . . An abundance of coarse
food was obtainable, but clothing was sadly
deficient. Difficulties and embarrassment beset
the pilgrims on every side, for Lane’s trip to the
old country in search of proselytes turned out
disastrously. Of the 45 individuals he imported
not one remains at the settlement, and it appears
the stock was pledged to provide funds for the
passage-money. . . . In conclusion, the Brisbaneite
wants to come back to Queensland, and the Govt,
is going to help him.” ... A sad and ludicrous
business !

Wherein Christie Murray was wrong ; at least I

even such a dead and alive city of the plains can
muster up enough enthusiasm for a Federation
League, then the cause in Maoriland is already
won.

S. A. PALMER, Esq., Yitadatio Depot, 47 Bourke Street, City.
Prell’s Building's, 60-70 Queen Street, Melbourne, May 31, 1899.
Dear Mr. Palmer, —I wrote you May sth a testimonial (entirely unsolicited) relative to the beneficial results your famed medicine
Yitadatio had accomplished in regard to a complaint to which I have been a martyr for years, viz. : Sciatic Rheumatism. I wrote the
letter in a guarded manner, being somewhat of a pessimist and knowing the incredulous
doubts that would arise. I find that lam or have—so to speak—“ awoke to find myself
famous.” “Is it genuine, Norton ? ” “ Could not cure you; impossible.” “An advertis-
ing dodge,” &c., &e., are the remarks I hear daily. Well, to those who know the agony I
have battled with—the suffering, the insomnia resulting from the same—my present re-
lief and entire freedom from pain must (from the fact that I have not taken any other
remedy) point to Vitadatio only. To preclude the slightest lingering doubts in the
minds of those who “ wish to scoff but prefer to pray,” I enclose you herewith a Statutory
Declaration, and may say “ An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.”
I am, very faithfully yours,
ficiU
K,
I, FREDERICK BENJAMIN NORTON, of Prell’s Buildings, 60 Queen Street, Melbourne, in the Colony of Victoria, do solemnly
and sincerely declare : —I am the person who gave to S. A. Palmer, the proprietor of the medicine known as Vitadatio, the testimonial dated
sth day of May, 1899, as follows
Prell’s Buildings, 60-70 Queen Street, Melbourne. May sth, 1899. Mr. S. A. Palmer, Esq., 45, 47 Bourke Street. Dear Sir. —I have
been hesitating for the last six months relative to the actual merits of your famous medicine, Vitadatio, and although I am anxious at all
times to recommend any sterling recipe for complaints similar to that from which I have suffered for the past ten years—namely, Sciatic
Rheumatism—l, knowing that my opinion and recommendation would carry weight amongst a wide circle of acquaintances, felt I must
actually satisfy myself beyond the slightest doubt before expressing an opinion good, bad, or indifferent. I have during my long career
travelled pretty well all over the world, tried many prescriptions, and acted upon medical advice from gentlemen of repute and standing.
I must say now conscientiously that although I have not been at all consistent regarding diet, etc., during the time I have taken Vitadatio,
still I have derived greater benefit from the same than from any other medicine. Each attack of Sciatic Rheumatism gradually lessens in its
intensity, and without doubt is rapidly being eradicated from my system. I think it iny duty to give you this testimonial and fervently hope
that those who have suffered like myself will be equally successful in obtaining relief. With good wishes for the future.
Obediently yours, FRED B. NORTON.

If
Fred B. Norton,
I say that the above testimonial is true and correct in every particular—that X was suffering from Sciatic Rheumatism, and that this affliction has now left me, and I say that I only became free from
this affliction after taking the medioine known as Vitadatio. And I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true and by virtue of the provisions of an Act of Parliament of
the Colony of Victoria rendering persons making a false declaration punishable for wilful and corrupt perjury. Declared at Melbourne, in the Colony of Victoria, the 31st day of May, 1899, before me—M.
A Harris, a Justice of the Peace in and for the Central Bailiwick. Ridgeway and Irwin, of 60 Queen Street, Melbourne, Solicitors for the said Frederick Benjamin Norton.

Westralia t’other day nearly passed a Dog
Act providing that when any man found a strange
dogkilling hissheep he could shootthe animal, after
advertising his fatal intention in three consecutive
issues of the local paper (published, perhaps, 100
milesaway) and once in the Government Gazette
at Perth. The Bill had got through the Assembly
and was nearly through the Council, when a
thoughtful member remarked that all this process
might easily take six weeks, and the dog might be
gone before then.
The way of the cold-tea martyr is indeed
hard. One was addressing a big crowd in an
Auckland (M.L.) street and pouring wrath and
contempt on the beastly publicans, when the man
in blue requested him to move on. Burning for
martyrdom he refused, and was run in and fined
Is. and costs. He declined to pay and announced
his intention of going to gaol, and being a great,
widely-advertised saint suffering for the “caws,”
but just as he was starting for there the Brewers’
Association paid the fine and exes, and spoiled
the martyrdom. Next time the temperance man
attempted to address the crowd he was greeted
with requests to speak kindly of the trade that
had kept him out of gaol. The beer-maker is a
low animal who deprives the poor saint of his God-
given right to pose as a martyr.

THE CELEBRATED EUCRASY CURE FOR DRUNKENNESS—ReguIar Price, -81; Cut Price, 18s. 6d.
Dr. CLARKSON’S
REINVIGORATOR.
A Concentrated, VITALISING, NERVE, BRATN,
MUSCLE, and BLOOD STIMULANT: a remedy
known to Dr. Clarkson only. As a Tonic for the NERVES
lit is unequalled. It is the most powerful of all BLOOD
(STIMULANTS and Muscle Developers.
.READ THESE FACT’S.—Its action in recuperating
the exhausted suhstance of the brain-cells is simply elec-
trical. The REINYIGORATOR is as necessary in brain-
work as sleep is to our existence. The brain-cells of per-
sons who have died during periods of great exhaustion
from over-exertion are found to be considerably changed
from the condition of the normal cell during health and
view.
WATER ON THE BRA IN.—The cell of the ex-
hausted brain, instead of being plump and full of nervous
matter, is vacuolated, a cavity within its substance having
formed and being filled with water. This means that a
part of the cell substance has been consumed during the
time of brain-activity.
DR. CLARKSON’S REINVIGORATOR, by its aotion
on the circulation of the Blood, replenishes all this wasted
substance. You can no more hope to go on working
successfully without this REINVIGORATOR than a loco-
motive can steam on indefinitely without fresh supplies
of ‘fuel.
POPULAR FALLACY.—PeopIe run away with the
idea that exercise recuperates the brain. This is a mis-
take. While exercise may rest the mentally-overworked
part, it exhausts other portions of the brain and leads to
utter fatigue. No exercise can take the place of this
REINVIGORATOR.

Every man and woman should wear one of these world-
famed Eleotric Belts. No more COLDS, no more INFLU-
ENZA, no more BACKACHES, no more RHEUMATISM.
SCIENTIFICALLY MADE.- This Electro-Band is
made on the most scientific principles. The electro-gal-
vanio current from this BELT passes through the body
and along the nerves for hours at a time in a GENIAL
AND CONTINUOUS STREAM, infusing new life and
vigor and toning up the entire system in a speedy and
permanent manner.
BY MEANS of silk-covered metallic electrical conduc-
tors the current is conveyed to silvered discs, and through
them into the body. The more animal magnetism or
electricity a person is possessed of, the more life and
energy there is in the system.
STOMACH AND LIVER.-The remedy most re-
quired to afford speedy and effective assistance to the
digestive organs, and give energy to the muscular and
nervous systems, is this Electro Bund. The electro-gal-
vanic current prevents the food from being a burden
rather than a supply to the weak stomach. We have the
utmost confidence in their efficacy—in fact, we consider
them Nature’s own remedy for many of the most common
complaints.

on worthless belts. Get the genuine article. You will
never regret the small outlay. Preserve your health and

Cabled that the Bryanites in New York
have been cheering Aguinaldo, the leader of the
Fil ipi nos, as “a true hero.” It needs a lively
imagination to find anything heroic about a man
who took a big bribe from the Spaniards to
abandon the revolutionary cause, then allied him-
self with the ’Murkans, then abandoned them,
and set up for himself.

Members of Vic. Winegrowers’ Conference
in Melb. at show-time told of wandering anxiously
from pub. to pub. in quest of a glass of good
native wine, and being served with vinegar, raw
spirits and saccharine, and other abominations, at
sixpence a dose. “All we can say to the credit
of the -publicans is that -the doses were—small,”
said one member. The Govt, is asked to “ take
prompt steps,” but politicians only do that on
pay-day, or when asked to step out and encourage
the whisky industry.
The Bulletin receives from N.S.W. Govt,
another large, officially printed paper which sets
forth that the weary Ur. Ross, M.L.A., has been
isking this question in the Assembly
Dr. Ross asked the Minister of Public Instruction-
(1) Will he ascertain from the Govt. Astronomer if
he can account on any scientific grounds for the reason
of the present remarkable anil unprecedented wet, un-
settled weather aiid rainfall from which Sydney and
coastal districts have been suffering during the last few
months; and why the drought in some parts of the in-
ter.or is still a source of trouble to settlers and pas-
toralists ?
(2.) Can he furnish any reasons, meteorological or
otherwise, for the existence of such precarious arid phe-
nomenal weather ?
“Wet, unsettled weather and rainfall,” to say
nothing of the humid moist liquid damp fluid that
often accompanies them, seem to get on to
old Ur. Ross's corns. And the price of the docu-
ment which sets forth the above question is gravely
quoted as being 3d.
B. II.: Wise is the creature _of electoral
caprice, and never quite knows when.he will be
left out by the voters. South Sydney returned
him in 'B7, rejected him in ’B9, and returned him
in '9l ; and Flinders returned him in ’94 and
rejected him in ’95. In ’B9 West Macquarie would
not have him. In the Federal delegates’ election
he was tenth—the last—man on the poll, and for
several hours it was a toss-up whether John See
or he would lie included in the elected. The look
on the faee.s of \\ ise and See as they watched the
figures at the U. I’, office at 11 p.in. was a study
to be remembered. At the July, ’9B, election the
result of Ash field s vote was delayed till midnight,
when Wise won by five votes only. B. R.W., it
was rumored, was to be opposed at Ash field by
F. E. Winehcombe, a popular business man of
no political experience, but the latter says lie is
content to wait for the dissolution, which he
prophesies will come three or four months
hence. As the new N.S.W. Attorney-General
showed splendidly in the Federal fight, he, if on
that ground alone, deserves to be re-elected—quite
apart from the fact that no Minister should be
opposed on taking office, save under very excep-
tional circumstances.
A certain police-sergeant at Prahran (Vic-
toria) is apparently a prompt Napoleonic bobby
who deserves well of his country. In his district
was a friendless sick woman for whom it was
desired to find hospital accommodation. A police-
man was sent to inquire if there was room for
her, and the hospital authorities cordially replied
that there wasn t. Then, in the ordinary course
of things, the sergeant should have reported the
matter, and the town clerk and the Mayor and
the health authorities should have communicated
with each other about it till tile patient died. But
the Brahran bobby simply took the sufferer
in a cab to the hospital, carried her in
there,, planted her down in the most comfortable
attitude be could manage, and walked off. Then
the hospital, as it couldn’t decently drop her on
the pavement, put her to bed in high dudgeon.
The board afterwards demanded a written explana-
tion regarding the outrage, and the sergeant gave
it at great length. He explained what he thought
the woman was suffering from, how she was
carried to the cab, how she was propped up in
the cab, the number of the cab, the general appear-
ance of the horse, the instructions given to the
driver about going slow and not bumping, the
route taken to the hospital—in fact, being re-
quested to explain his conduct, he took the request
literally, and explained it. And now the hospital
board is angrier at the explanation than it was at
the original outrage.
At Townsville (Q.) recently John Rees
committed the dark crime of falling asleep on the
beach. While he was sleeping the brilliant, plain-
clothes policeman bore down on him. Some pro-
perty had been stolen, and certain footmarks, pre-
sumably those of the thief, had been found round
the place where the property had been before it
went away, and the policeman was looking for
somebody whose boots fitted the marks. He tried
the sleeping man at random, and his boots fitted
—at least they fitted near enough. Considering
that about half the adult male population wears
No. 7 ready-irufde boots, and that footmarks are
generally rather indefinite, it is probable that the
boots of 500 other men in Townsville would also
have fitted these marks. Consequently John
Rees was run in. Nothing was known against
him, and none of the lost property was
found on him, but his boots and the darkly-sus-
picious circumstance that he had fallen asleep on
the beach were against him, so he was remanded
oft and on for two weeks. Every time he came up
ho told the bench that he had been mining at
Alligator Creek on the dateof the alleged robbery,
and offered, if allowed out in custody of that
intelligent and painstaking officer, Constable
O’Booligan, to find men in Townsville who could
prove bis alibi, but the bench only shook its
large wooden head and remanded Kees some more.
It wouldn’t even make any serious inquiry itself
into his alibi ; it was too busy trying to fit him
violently into the crime, and (indirectly) to put
down tin* inmky offence of sleeping on the beach.
And at the end of two weeks it found, to its great
surprise, that Rees had really been miles away
when the theft took place—by which time the
offender bad got a long start and the footmarks
hid perished through effluxion of time. Then it
had bitter thoughts about giving Rees three
months for sleeping on the beach, but as certain
lifficulties were in the way that brutal and hard-
ened criminal was let off.
Alleged that there prevails in Romo an
impression that the Pope intends to establish to
represent him in Australia a high Italian digni-
tary, such as is already so placed in America.
Something about the early Reid. The re-
cent N.S. VV. Premier first tumbled into the arena of
public life with a pungent pamphlet attacking
Henry Parkes over the Panama route mail-con-
tract. This drew the attention of Sydney’s leading
mercantile men towards Parkes’ ruddy adversary,
and Thomas Sutcliffe Mort was certain that a
young man of great political potentialities had
appeared on the scene. Parkes never forgave and
never forgot the pamphleteer, although he twice
offered him a portfolio. In iBG9, when he was
thought to be the real leader of the rising young
men of Sydney, Reid and VV. C. Windeyer, then
in Parliament, challenged attention; together
with G. R. Dibbs they founded the Australian
Patriotic Association, which celebrated its first
big appearance in public by a picnic at Clontarf.
On that occasion, Windeyer responded to “ The
Land we Live in.” Reid responded for “The
Association,” and echoed Windeyer’s patriotic,
not to say Jingoistic, utterances. Dibbs proposed
“ The Press,” and complimented N.S. Wales and
Sydney on possessing two such rising men as
Windeyer and Reid. And how the latter loved
each other a quarter of a century afterwards !
Also, how fondly Reid and Dibbs still cling to
each other 1
“ Hell hath no fury like a mummer
scorned ! ” List to the tale of woe of one James
Carter-Edwards, a hyphenated retainer of that
turbulent tragedian, Wilson Barrett. Barrett,
Carter-Edwards, Lewis Scott, Nugent Robertson,
and others, had a great controversy, and said a
lot of nasty things and jeered at each other a
while ago in Sydney D.T., and The Bulletin
stepped in and jeered at them all impartially.
VV hereupon Carter-hyphen-Edwards now sends us
from England the following terrific outburst. The
fun of it is that The Bulletin rather overlooked
Carter-hyphen-Edwards in the controversy—in
fact, considered him merely as one likely to get
trodden on in the crush, and said next to nothing
about him. Ho was only referred to in one line as
“Carter, mind the hyphen-Edwards, too.’’ And
hasn t it just roused him ! Hear him bellow !
Limelight, please, and slow music for Mr. Carter-
hyphen-Edwards :
To think of it! We might have called him some-
thing worth talking about, and here we have gone
and passed over this foeman worthy of our steel
with a pitiful jeer about his hyphen. Wait till
the gentleman comes back ! We will have a few
real insults saved up for him.
Vic. miners will be able to make out a strong
case in support of their plea to be put on the
same footing as seamen with respect to old-
age pensions—on the same footing, or some-
thing like it. Mining is subject to extraordinary
fluctuations, and so miners have to shift their
ground often—from dull Vic. fields to NVestralia,
Broken Hill, the Tas. West Coast, or elsewhere.
And then scores of men, played-out by working
in thedeepor badly-ventilatedgroundof Bendigo
or Ball arat, go for a spell to other fields, just as
men passed from Broken Hill to Vic. to have a
spell out of the lead, and then went back again.
Also, many N.S. W. mines are more Vic.-owned
than N.S. W.-owned. Not one Broken Hill
mine has its business-centre in N.S. \V., and
not a first or second-rate Westralian mine has
its head office in the province. This is a con-
dition which distinguishes mining from every
other industry. But though special provisions
like those suggested by the miners will remove
some hardships, nothing short of an Australian
pension scheme will be quite satisfactory.
Workmen have had to be Australian for many
years past; there are scores in every trade who
would have starved if they had baulked at
boundary lines.
Item from the speech at opening of Queens-
land Parliament:—
O n ? °f the results directly following upon the adoption
in this colony of the Commonwealth Bill will necessarily
be an alteration of our electoral law. By the Act refer-
ring the question to the electors it was prescribed that
no elector should vote more than once at the poll, not-
withstanding that his name appeared on more than one
electoral roll, and in the draft constitution itself it is
pro\ ided that, in the choosing of senators and of members
of lhe House of Representatives, each elector shall vote
only once. My advisers consider that it would be anoma-
lous that, in pronouncing upon matters of local concern,
the existing system of plural voting should obtain, while
on wider questions of national import electors should be
restricted to a single vote, and they propose accordingly
to submit to you a Bill assimilating in this respect the
franchise in Queensland to that of the Commonwealth.
Advantage will he taken of the opportunity to remedy
certain inconsistencies in our Elections Act, and to alford
increased facilities for every qualified person to register
his name as an elector.
Yet the anti-Federal Ananias party in Queensland
swore to the bitter end that there was no One-
man-one-vote in the Commonwealth Bill. Federa-
tion has already led to Victoria getting One-man-
one-vote at Assembly elections, and it is almost
certain that it will confer the same blessing on
Queensland.
AN ADDRESS.
To be spoken by Wilson Barrett, in sincere admiration
of the Fot-oaliaiit, and behind-a-hedge lies and slanders
published by the Banders of the Sewer Press.
Since last we met “ full thirt3 r times hath ” —no. that’s
musty.
But, yet, earth's axle, here, has creaked a little rusty;
Or did my ears mislead? And does this croak, or
creak i n g,
Come front the souls of those whose “moral crease” is
leaking?
Or from those God-souled scribes who put—with valor
shoddy—
A bullet in your reputation—not your body?
Who—like the vulture, when ill hunger’s flight he’s
preyintr—
Leaves all that’s sweet, and swoops where foulness lies
degating !
hat shall I say? llow tilt against these muck-daubed
lancers ?
There are no lower depths to match them with our
answers !
I can t do better, p’raps, than herein make confession
Of all our sins which goad these scribes to wroth ex-
pression.
First, then, your praise we won, my gentle dames and
masters ;
You gave us full success, they prophesied disasters !
False prophets ever grizzle, when they fail at cursing!
They cannot lead by Light, but Terror and coercing.
You see, we’re English born ! to them that’s wormwood
bitter !
They re like to none —sole microbes of a pest-born litter !
Their jeers deny us brain and Art, but prate of ravings !
Yet mark their envious groanings, born of brain of
shavings !
Be judge, good friends, what crimes they say we have
committed !
They pounce upon a “ hyphen,” as if ’twere unfitted
lor eyes polite; and, 10, they’d send poor Carter-
Ed wards
Forgive the dash .'—to chains, or into sulphur bed-wards !
And then, oh, Scott! I fear, alas ! their stings have
killed him !
Or rendered prone his brain ! or with deep shame have
filled him.
Blest he, if with these “ village mongrels” he had herded,
And, with their gall-dipped pen, more spleenful lies had
worded.
Oods! how these Austral scourges snarl their calling
gorge full! e
Of poison pin-pricks Littleness they have a force full
But these they had withheld, and’ fain they would have
bless'd us,
If whelped like them—we in their currish mind had
dress'd us.
Or if—with brain deseased, imbibing “Bass” or “ Wat-
ney ”
We, with this canine pack, had been dumped down at
Bot'ny !
Or “like a sucking dove” they would have roared their
spite out,
If we had bowed our flesh for them to tear and bite out.
Cur A.N.R.—whose tail they decked with string and
kettle—
These kindred mongrels sent a-yelping, tuned with metal
So tinny, cracked, and yet so viciously discordant,
They jointly licked their snarling jaws in sweet reward
on't.
We dared-oh, gods ! yes, DARED-to guard us from the
smiter;
And scoffed the bloated heads of these square-iialo'd
writers !
Then, cruel brutes, their onslaught big on little Hodces,
Wiped him from earth, save just some blots of microbe
splodges !
Indeed, what Reputation have these scribes not stricken ?
What honest work not cursed? While noxious growths
they quicken.
They say I have decried your Art! abused your country !
Much worse than lying, this —’tis cowardly affront’ry !
To pull down Art they climb—" Excelsior ” and “Allez!”
Their praise no higher mounts than the fat legs of the
ballet !
Speak WORTH !—from Australasia’s furthest capes, to
Bight of it—
Have you been fostered by their aid, or in despite of it ?
“ But, stay ! ” they cry, “ your rhymes are foul retalia-
tion !
Our slanders are but Seraph’s sonys, or sweet damnation.
We steal a cow, a herd !—no crime the world alleges—
But you ! llow dare you even peep across the hedges?"
But this apart, good friends, and well I know you’re
many,
Remember this, we’re absent! Strangers I and should any
Of these envenomed pens repeat their foul mud-slinging,
Or stab us in the dark, and send more lies broad flinging,
Think only that we love .you, with good faith, and truly !
Believe we bl ess and honor yourgreat country, throughly!
That not one word, one thought, of mine, or of the
others,
But w hat recalls you as our friends, our sisters, brothers !
They'll proffer still their feast of gall ; kill names with
slanders !
They’ll still ban all of Good, and bless all filthy Panders !
But when they’ve done their WORST—a task which their
soul gladdens—
This Halm's for us— and this their jealous passion mad-
dens !
We woo your hone of Right, and not in vain we’ll woo it ;
And though they spit their spleen, we’ll thrive and still
live through it !
JAMES CARTER-EDWARDS.

To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir.—l feel it my duty to write and tell you how
your remedies have cured me.
I suffered great agony with WEAK NERVES and
RHEUMATICS, and I sent for some of your ALFALINE
REMEDIES, which completely cured me, and I have felt
as well as I could wish, although it is two years ago.
I also tried your ALFALINE UNIVERSAL PILLS,
which completely cleared my skin and purified my blood,
and I am now using your ALFALINE HAIR RESTORER,
which has thoroughly cleaned the scalp and made the
hair grow again, and It has gradually turned the hair
from being grey to that of its original color. I have also
recommended your Remedies for a number of different
complaints and I have never known them to fail, but to
do all that was claimed for them. I have great pleasure
to recommend these remedies to all sufferers, as I know
they can be depended on.
You are at liberty to publish this as well as my photo.
Yours truly, C. J. A. NIELSEN.

Something is After You.
Far away, in the Jungle of Central India, a
village lies asleep. Only a solitary human figure
can be seen, following the winding jungle path in
the moonlight. It is early night, and the native
who comes has been delayed on his way home.
But what is that dark shadow that crosses the
path behind him? Quite oblivious, the man
inarches on. He looks neither to right rtor left
nor behind him, where crouches that dark shadow.
A few yards more and he will be out of the jungle.
A few minutes more, and he thinks he will be
sleeping in the bosom of his family . But see-, the
Shadow moves ! With two noiseless bounds like
a giant cat the tigress is upon him. One. despair-
ing scream and all is quiet. Bitten through the
head, the victim is snatched up and carried by the
grim man-eater to her lair in the hills. Meanwhile
the village slumbers peacefully on.
Was it the man’s fault? Yes, I think it was.
Had he not lingered, he would not have been
caught. The tigress would not have attacked him
in broad daylight. But he was no worse I think
than those in this country who are to-day doing
the very same thing. Thousands and thousands
of English men and women haveashadow in their
path. It is after them. The time will come, if
they do not take heed, when they will feel, like
Mrs Lydia Golding, “as if something had over-
taken” them. Here is a letter from her in which
she tells her experience :
I “All my life 1 had been a strong healthy woman,
and up to the autumn of 1891 1 never ailed any-
thing. At this time I began to feel weak, weary,
and tired, and as if someth in;/ had overtaken me. I
had a foul taste in the mouth, my tongue being
furred, and a sour fluid would rise into my mouth.
I had no appetite to speak of, and the little food I
took gave me no strength. After eating I had a
heavy weight and pain across my chest, and a
gnawing feeling in my stomach. I belched up a
deal of frothy fluid, and in the night I awoke with
a suffocating feeling. Cold clammy sweats broke
over me, and what with loss of appetite, and not
being able to sleep at night I soon got so weak
that / found it hard work to net about.
“On December, 23, 1892(0ne Sunday morning),
whilst preparing breakfast for my husband, I was
suddenly seized with paralysis, which affected the
whole of my right side. I had no use of my hand
or leg on that side, and a numbness took me on
both left and rioht sides. My husband got me to
bed, and fetched a doctor from NorthHeet, who gave
me medicines. After this I lost my strength
rapidly, and what I suffered I cannot tell.
“I could not rest night or day and I was in and
out of bed every now and again. I got little sleep,
only dozing off for a short time and then starting
up. I was afraid to be left alone, and often in the
night I have been so nervous and frightened I
could scarcely bear it. I took medicines of all
kinds, but was little better for anything until one
day in August, 1893, my husband read in the paper
“Weekly People, ” of Mother Seigel’s Curative
Syrup, and got me a bottle from Perry and Son,
Chemists, High Street, Gravesend. After taking
it a short time, I began to gain strength, and got
stronger, and stronger until I was free from the
effects of the seizure. I now keep in good health.
You can publish this statement if you wish. ”
Yours truly, (Signed) Mrs. Lydia Golding, 12,
Carter’s Road, Perry Street, Gravesend, May 14th.
1890.
What was this shadow that had crossed Mrs.
Golding’s path? What was it that “overtook”
her and laid her helpless and suffering upon a bed
of sickness? Surely you can recognise the mon-
ster that sprang upon her as the dreaded disorder
Dyspepsia, which attacks you when you are most
defenceless and weakest. Paralysis; yes, Mrs.
Golding had it, and could feel it, but' what she
could -not feel was what it was that had so acted
upon her nerves and muscles as to cause them to
become so helpless. Nor could she, I suppose,
understand hoiv Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup
cured her so quickly, though we know now that it
was because the dyspepsia was got rid of.
But, as the native was never heard of more so
there are some who cannot get out of the clutches
of Dyspepsia, even with such help as Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup, if the help comes too
late. Hence the best way of all, say I, is to keep
out of the jungle after dark ;and if you must go
walk quickly.

The Case of
MR. THOMAS MATTHEWS.
(by a special.)
(For the “ Bur wood Courier.”)
“Is Mr. Matthews at home?” enquired
the newspaper man, as the door opened to
Ins knock.
“ Who wants me ? ” replied a cheery voice,
as the gentleman himself stepped forward,
and politely enquired our errand.
“ Mr. Matthews, it may here be said, is a
well known resident of Enfield, on the
Burwood Road, and the owner of the finest
herd of milch cows in the district.
“I havo heard, Mr. Matthews,” said the
reporter, “from one of your relations, that
you are a great enthusiast in the matter of
Clements Tonic, and are continually sounding
its praises ; will you kindly tell me how you
came to form that opinion ?”
“Practical experience” answered Mr.
Mattiiews ; “proof in my own person, verified
time after time during these last few years.
It accomplished what nothing else even
attempted to do in my own case, so I simply
speak as I find.”
“Will you kindly give mo the details of
your sickness, Mr. Matthews?”
‘ It is seven or eight years ago that I first
noticed that something was radically wrong
with me. I did not understand what it was,
nor can I assign any reason for the bad state
of health into which I gradually drifted.”
“ What were your symptoms ? ”
“ I was taken with sudden fits of giddiness,
my brain seemed to whirl round and round,
everything I saw' with my eyes appeared to
swim and turn about. It was as though I
had been running round and round in a ring,
as children will at play till they become so
topsy-turvey that they cannot stand up.
This was how I felt, I could not stand up.
I had to clutch hold of the first thing handy
to prevent my falling, and then go and lie
down a while till the attack passed off. ”
“ Were these attacks very frequent, Mr.
Matthews ? ”
“ Yes : in the morning, particularly when
I stooped to lace my boots while dressing,
then my brain would co nmence to swim and
sway, and I would have to lie down to save
myself from falling down.”
“ Did you have any other disorder? ”
“ I began to find that certain foods did not
agree with me. I had to restrict myself in
drinking tea, for instance. But with all these
precautions, I found the action of thedigestive
organs was still deranged. After meals I had
a severe pain in the pit of the stomach and an
accumulation of wind there; this wind used to
belch up, then my pains would ease. Often and
often I would vomit up my food, and sometimes
in the middle of a meal the giddy sickness
would come over me and I was compelled to
get up and leave the table.”
“I was always more liable to attack on
Sundays, and had to be very careful in my
diet. No doubt this arose from my resting on
that day from active exercise, which, as we
all know, assists digestion.”
“ Did you have other troubles?”
“ When my giddiness came on there were
pains in my forehead and temples and I had
very frequently a sharp pain between the
shoulder blades. These were all the actual
pains I suffered ; but far worse was the
mental de, ression and sickness of spirits that
oppressed me at that time.”
“ Tell me about that, Mr. Matthews?”
“ I got into low spirits, dismal thought®
haunted me, I was always foreboding ill
things or impossible calamities. I fancied
something dreadful was going to happen
to the* Business, my family, or myself,
that never happened or was likely to happen.
My giddy fits made me so uneasy, not
knowing their cause, that I was sure I wa®
going out of my mind, and that they ivere
the premonitory symptoms. This further
tended to accentuate my gloom of mind.
All the world appeared overcast to me. I
did not care for anything or take interest
in what was going on around me. 1 was
in that hopeless mental state that I did not
care if 1 lived or died. This was in my
waking moments ; but when 1 tried to sleep
I got no relief; my slumber was troubled by
nightmare, and horrible dreams. At one time
I would imagine I was falling over a
precipiee into unseen depths below ; or that
bolted and in deadly peril of an imminent
I was on the back of a horse that had
smash into some obstacle, and so on, my
dreams were endless variations of terrible
dangers. And, finally, when my fright in
sleep got to the last point it would wake me
up in a trembling sweat, feverish and
unrested. ”
“ Did you consult a medical man, Mr.
Matthews ? ”
“ Yes, I went to see a doctor and told
him my symptoms, and he said I suffered
from indigestion and he ordered me some
medicine, which I took without benefit; but
I may say from what I had heard 1 did not
persevere with his treatment.”
“ What was that you heard, Mr. Mat-
thews.”
“Friends told me that I should find a
certain cure for my sufferings in Clements
Tonic —that it was a wonderful remedy.”
“ And you followed their advice ?”
“ Yes, I purchased a bottle at once and it
had such a marvellous curative effect that I
could not have believed possible had I not
actually experienced the benefit. Like
magic, all my distressing pains and mental
gloom disappeared. My digestion was re-
stored to its natural condition, I no longer
had the pain in the pit of the stomach after
eating, the belching wind, or the pain
between the shoulder blades. My fits of
giddiness ceased and the weight of
imaginary trouble was lifted from my mind.
I slept without evil dreams and my spirits
regained their natural buoyancy and
cheerfulness.”
“ And you give all the credit of this
transformation to Clements Tonic solely ? ”
“Oh, I have no doubt of it, fori have
proved it limes and times again. 1 always
keep a bottle of Clements Tonic in the
house, and at the least sign of a return of
my old complaint, 1 take a dose or two and
it never fails to cure my tioubles right off.”
Have youany objections, Mr. Matthews, to
this interview being published in the press ?”
asked the reporter.
“ Not in the least. I shall be only too
pleased if my experience should meet the
eye of some one in my own unfortunate
condition of years gone by; it might be the
means of guiding them to the same reb'p
that I have obtained.”

Her Coup-de-Theatre.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They had been engaged for a year and a half, but
lately she had notioed that his love was beginning
to 0001. He never talked in the old, rapturous
way of “some day,” and their daily meetings had
dwindled down to weekly, without even letters
between.
The last time she saw him she had noticed that
her laughter and smart speeches had jarred on
him, and he had spoken in praise of a woman of
their acquaintance with a soft, cooing voice.
“Purring,” the girl called it.
Bhe expected him to-night, and had made up
her mind for battle, and victory. She clad her-
self in her woman’s armour—a dress he liked the
best, a clinging white cashmere that left her throat
and shoulders bare. Her soft round arms and
neck were her strongest weapons, and she meant
to use them.
She was sitting in a low chair when he came,
and he noticed how the yellow cushion behind her
head suited her eyes, her soft brown eyes.
She rose as he came towards her and held out
her hands with a glad gesture.
“ I knew you would come to-night, for I have
been thinking of you all day.”
He sat down by the fire, bub she did nob go
back to her chair. She stood behind him, her
fingers playing in his hair in a tender, motherly
way. She did not speak for some minutes, but he
could feel her heart against his ear as she leant
over him. It made it very hard for him to say
what he had come to tell her. He wished he had
written, or waited till to-morrow. Why had she
worn that frock to-night? He had not seen it for
months. And why was she so soft and sweet to-
night, when she had been so different lately ? ”
“Dear,” her voice was a caress, “ why did you
stay away so long ? I have been so lonely.” Her
bare arm came soft and warm round his neck, and
her cheek was laid on his hair.
He could never tell her like this. He must do
it at once.
He got up quickly and walked across the room
and back again. She stood watching him with a
hurt, wondering look.
“What is the matter, Jim? Something is
troubling you. Have you anything to tell me ? ”
“Yes, I have. Won’t you sit down? I can’t
talk while you are standing there.’’
She sat down in her chair by the fire, but he
stood against the mantelshelf. It gave him
courage to stand thus looking down on her, and
clumsily, in his man’s way, he told her what, he
had come to say.
It was just what she had expected. They had
both made a mistake. . . . They were not suited
to each other. . . . He had met another girl, a
little, fair-haired thing who was just the sorb of
gentle woman he wanted for a wife.
“You are too clever for me, Joy, you know.
You would soon grow tired of a big, stupid fellow
like me. You want a man who can talk poetry
and metaphysics and stuff like that. And 1 want
a wife who cares for home things more than
books. You must see that we have both been
mistaken, don’t you Joy ? ”
She sat listening, with her hands clasped before
her, her eyes never leaving his face for one second.
When ho finished speaking', she made just one
little ohoking sound, and hid her face against the
ohair.
She did not speak at all, and he stood looking
down at her, wishing she would not sit like that
but would say something. He had expected
angry, cutting things, but instead there was
silence, and that bent head. What a pretty head
it was 1 The firelight shone on the bright brown
hair, and played in the deep ripples above her
ear. Those ripples were never made by tongs or
curling-pins, and neither was that little curl that
lay on her neck, and tried to hide the tiny mole.
He remembered that mole so well. She had
always grumbled at it, but he had kissed it and
called it her beauty-spot. How long ago that
was ! It was soon after they were engaged ; the
night he had given her that emerald ring. He
glanced at her hand hanging limp by her side.
Yes, there it was in the same place on her little
finger—she would not have it on the third. Her
hand would look strange without it, for it was the
only one she wore. It was a dear hand. Too
thin for actual beauty, but soft and well-shaped ;
and, after all, he did not like fat hands. Hers
were firm and cool, and so comforting when one’s
head ached. Ilithel’s hands were such baby
things, soft and pink and kissable, but he
liked a woman to have firm, strong
hands best. Joy’s were strong. He remem-
bered how she had held his dog the day the
poor little brute broke its leg. She had cried so
hard afterwards, too. He wondered if she were
crying now. Her head was still hidden. Would
she never look round ? He couldn’t stand it much
longer. He wanted to comfort her. That little
moje seemed to invite him to kiss it. He—
She lifted her head and looked at him. Her
eyes were wet, but they gleamed with a depth of
love he had never seen there before. All the
sparkle had gone, out of them, but something
sweeter had come in. She rose and came to where
he was standing.
“ Perhaps you are right, dear! lam too hard
and worldly for you.” Hard !—with that look in
her eyes ! “ She will make the soft, yielding wife
you want, and I know you will be happy. We
W u\ Say £°°d-byo, and you must go away for a
while, and then I shall get used to it—some day,”
She was fidgetting with some violets in a bowl
beside her, and he could see she had something
more to say.
Suddenly she lifted her face to him and held
out her hands.
“Jim, Jim ! kiss me just once before you go !
You will be hers soon, but now you are mine still.
I love you ; oh, my dear, I love you ! ”
Her head was thrown back. Her red lips were
parted in eagerness, and her eyes glowed with
passion. She had never looked so beautiful before.
For one second he looked at her, and then ....
one white arm was round his neck, her head was
bowed on his shoulder, and she had conquered.
* • • *
When he said good-bye, two hours later, it was
settled that the wedding should be in a month.
‘I nearly made a big mistake,” he said ; “which
only proves that I was right when I said you
were too sweet and clever for such an ass.”
Her only answer then was a kiss, but when the
door closed behind him she smiled at herself in
the glass.
“Yes, he was right! I am far too clever for
him. It was a fine piece of acting, ma chbre I” —
with a little bow to her image in the glass—“and
it brought down the house ! ”
FAYRE.
The Philosopher.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was sitting on a stump with the usual smile of
contentment making drains in his face to carry
off the perspiration. I remarked that it was hot.
He grinned and said, “ Nice warm weather, ain’t
it?” A fly fell from his forehead frizzled, and
the reflection from a vagrant tin dish struck me as
if from the hand of God. I threw myself under
the speckled shade of a ragged butt-oak and eyed
the Philosopher. His smile took on a twist of
superiority as he watched me scrape the dust and
sweat off my face, and blow vapor at 98 on the
end of my nose to save it from liquefaction.
“ How the blazes do you manage it ? Are you
guaranteed against heat-stroke ? ” I asked.
“Naw, I’m just enjoyin’it—l enjoys every-
thing.”
A red bull-ant crossed my line of vision bound
Philosopher-wards. The set of his body denoted
warfare. Disgusted with the curse of Life-under-
the-circumstances, he had dug up the hatchet.
“ You enjoy everything ? How about frost ? ”
“ Beautiful, sir—beautiful! Pine, bracing air
on the cold winter mornings—glorious when the
sun rises and clears the mists of night away! ”
I agreed.
“ How, confess ! ” I said, “ when something un-
expected happens—say, bump your head on a
ridge-pole, stub your toe on the one stump in a
ten-mile stretch of three-chain road—do you never
curse ? ”
“ Never, sir—never! I laugh instead.”
Certainly there was method in this lunacy, but
I suspected hypocrisy. I awaited the progress of
the bull-ant. He had stopped half-way up to the
sock-ledge overhanging the brown blucher, and
had assumed an interrogatory attitude as of a
soul questioning the Unknown on the threshold.
“ And where—where do you find the element
of humor in the business ? ”
The Philosopher stretched out both legs, assum-
ing a half-lying, half-sitting position. The
trouser-leg moved downwards. The bull-ant was
ushered into the Unknown.
“ I look at it, sir, as I think God looks at it.
Don’t you think, when He sees you dancin’ round
like a damned sperrit just because of yer own
carelessness, He must laugh ? ”
The view was new.
“ Do you ever pray ? ”
“ Never. Think you He’d stop His machinery
because a fly had got under the belting ? ”
“ You look on the firm of Heaven and Co. as a
crowd of practical jokers ? ”
“ That’s about it.”
“Laughing at Humanity’s pain.”
“ Yes, the pain is there—there’s more of it than
anything else in the world. And what’s it for ?
It amuses somebody ! ”
“You suspect God ? ”
“ He’s the cause—object not stated.”
I was killing time. I judged it was up to the
ant by this time to adduce his little argument.
“ Yours is a cheerful philosophy, my friend,” I
said, rising and sweeping the dead leaves and dust
off my pants.
“ Yes ” (he rose). “I’m always happy—always
contented. Nothing ever ruffles me ! —nothing
can disturb—oh, hell 1 Dash and blank and
blast 1 What the ”
I threw myself on the dust again and laughed.
The day had grown cooler, and I fancied I could
hear the laughter of the hosts. A crushed bull-
ant and a crumpled Philosopher 1 I understood
God.

AN EVENTFUL DAY IN THE HISTORY OF
NEW SOUTH WALES.
19th April, 1770.
Along the virgin coast primeval silence reigns,
Save when the stubborn rock the dashing wave disdains
While wrapped in sloth secure the native savage lies,
Content to live and die beneath his native skies.
Twas naught to him that strife immense, on sea and
land,
Blazed in the north from prairie waste to coral strand ;
That in the East a Clive had more than stood his ground;
That in the West a Wolfe had grave and glory found ;
Or that a Walpole’s tact, and freedom from display,
Had nerved the British race for Pitt’s majestic day !
Nor did he dream that any such advancing power
Gould cast its fatal shadow o’er his humble dow’r.
Alas ! the might that thundered on those distant seas
Gould even penetrate such unknown seas as these!
For, as his looks roam round the unfrequented verge
VYhere Heav’n appears to rest upon the lonely surge
And which for cycles past his simple sires had scanned
And saw no danger rise to vex their native land—
He starts! affrighted, and beholds a monstrous thino-
''bring* 1 knows ’ 00 joy ’ or friends > or peace can
What mad’ning fears possess his soul as next he sees.
The horror grows with each auspicious breeze !
Ah ! could he realise the fate that nears the shore,
How would his barbarous heart the awful day deplore 1
How different are the joys which fire the noble Cook,
How thankful in his heart, how happy does he look 1
The land ahead ”is proudly watched bv all on board.
Who ve won more lasting fame than any of the sword ;
The course they steered was all unknown, the stars un
known ;
On her broad beam their lusty barque was often thrown.
But, fearless all, and true as steel, they never swerved
From faith in.the great British sailor whom they served.
As up the coast the staunch Endeavour bravely stands
Each day confirms the growing’ promise of these lands ;
And when their country’s flag's unfurl'd upon the strand
Eaeh valiant heart beats high amorist the patriot band.

Who Says So?
Tt matters a lot whose word you have for a statement, doesn’t it?
The story about a man being cured of some trouble away up in Queensland or down in
Victoria may be so, but you’ve no way of proving it.
But when we tell you about Sydney people—
People who live right here, and whose statement you can prove in an hour any day—
Well, when we tell you about these people being cured of kidney troubles of every sort
by that little Conqueror of Kidney ills,
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills,
You haven’t much excuse for not believing it, have you ?
And that’s the proof we give you. f ydney proof. The word of your neighbors.
They’ve suffered—They’ve taken Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills—and now they’re glad of
the opportunity to tell others about it.
We select three from the hundreds of Sydney statements at hand :
Mr. Charles Alexander, 143 Riley-street, Woollooinooloo, says:—
“ While working I ani obliged to lift heavy articles, and this, I believe,
affected my kidneys, as about two years ago I began to feel severe pains in
my back. Many widely-advertised medicines were tried without gaining
any advantage. Indeed, I seemed to be getting worse, when an attack of
influenza left my kidneys in such a state that I could scarcely bear up
against the pains. The doctor to whom I went treated me for Bright’s
Disease, and his treatment did me a certain amount of good, but I still had
a racking pain across the kidneys and up between the shoulders. I could
not turn in bed and my baok felt as if someone were trying to cut out the
backbone. At last I was wholly confined to my bed, when a friend came
to see me and remarked that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills had relieved
him wonderfully. So some were obtained for me at Newman’s Pharmacy,
King Street, and I set about taking them. They gradually improved me
and when I had used them all was entirely well again. The Pills have also
cured one of my children who was afflicted with urinary trouble.”
The above is what Mr. Alexander said one year ago. He repeats his
testimony to-day, and says :—“ Since I gave this testimonial twelve
months ago I have had no reason to change my opinion. I still believe
that they are the best pills ever brought into Australia. I have tried
medicines which have been extensively advertised, and also drank stuff
prescribed by doctors, but I would never fall back on any of them, as none
of them gave me satisfaction for my money, but Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills were cheap at ten times the price. Some of the kidney medicines I
have taken were, like swallowing knives to out away the disease, but Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills were mild and thoroughly effective.” Mr.
Alexander works at the Lending Library in Queen Victoria Markets.
Mr. Martin Nicholas, whose city address is No. 16, Elizabeth-street,
says:—“A year ago I gave my testimony as to the wonderful benefits
derived from Doan’s Backache Kidney Fills. I had been a great sufferer
from kidney trouble for a long time. My back ached so terribly at night
that 1 could scarcely sleep, and was so sore that I could hardly turn over or
get out of bed. The disease, or whatever it was, was getting a firmer hold
on me, and at one time I was laid up in bed for three whole weeks. The
doctor advised an operation, but I would not consent to this. I finally got
out again, but I was a constant sufferer. At times the pain in my back
was so severe that I could hardly stand up. I had tried doctors and
numerous remedies, but not until I had taken Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills did I get relief. I purchased these pills at Newman’s Pharmacy in
King-street. I continued the treatment until I was completely cured. It
is nearly a year ago since I discontinued using Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills, but I have had no return of my old complaint, and this convinces me
more firmly than ever that these pills are a true specific for kidney troubles
and as such I will always recommend them to my friends.”
Mr. J. Frodd, China and Glass Riveter, 99 Crown-street, says “I
suffered from the effects of kidney complaint for three years. The small
of my back ached very severely, and when I had occasion to stoop down I
could not straighten myself without great pain. I was also afflicted with
various urinary troubles. lam glad to say thatDoan’sßackacheKidney Pills,
which I obtained at Newman’s Pharmacy, King-street, have completely
oured me, and I can honestly recommend them to any person suffering
from kidney complaint.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am the foolish artist,
Far-fallen from the height
Where winged-gifts up-bore me,
When life was young with light.
I am the foolish artist
(Drugged brain and rolling gait).
Men choke desire within them
And profit by my fate.
They stay me in the by-ways
(High morals make them bold),
I seem to drink their sermons;
I drink instead their gold.
But such as seal their purses,
The word-free, miser tribe,
I flay with whips of satire,
And stab with goodly jibe.
Along the hard, black pavement,
When lost to woe and weal,
The Loved-of-God lie dreaming—
I, God-abandoned, reel.
At times, when sleep eludes them,
They hear my footsteps roll—
“ What ails the foolish artist
That he drowns thus his soul! ”
“ What ails the foolish artist ? ”
The good wife turns to weep ;
“ Thank God, I’m not as he is ”
The good man falls asleep.
I knocked at the gate of Glory,
And straight it opened wide :
A whisper wooed me earthward,
E’er I had stood inside.
I knocked at the Heart of Woman,
Knocked with me boor and lout,
“ Come open, O Heart of Woman,
An artist stands without.”
But chill on my soul fell answer,
As though a cold wind blew—
“Go hence, you foolish artist,
Here is no room for you.”
Since then the foolish artist,
Long lost to dreams divine,
Hath ta’en the way of folly
And bowed his knee to wine.
Lights out! and the clock is striking :
Lights out! and out o’ luck :
Last stroke !—and the green tide gurgles ;
Lights out! . . . And the Hour has struck.
RODERIC QUIN.
A Brewer’s Story.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Ah!” said the bald-headed man, with a half-
dead smile, “ never run a brewery ! I had been
in the shipping trade, the newspaper business,
drapery, mining, the law, the stage, the church
but I found that I was a perfect baby when,
in my innocmce, I undertook to run a brewery.
Look how thin lam ! Yet they say that beer’s a
food and that when a man’s drinking he wants no
tucker!
“I began my management a youngish man and
a happy one. Every morning at nine I started
out in a buggy with both eyes keen for detail, and
a resolve set to win or die. And I ended ! Look
at my bald head !—and at my coats hanging
round the wall there ! —all smelling of patchouli
thrown over me by barmaids. Of course the
tied-houses accounted for much of my hair :
in my city 95 per cent, of the houses were
tied. But then that’s so the world over, and we
knew it when we started. King Beer in his
palace chuckled at our temerity—so tremendous
was the handicap against us. We worked, and
worked, and worked ; mined and countermined ;
lied and counter-lied. Ah ! the foxes. Nearly
every publican is a fox of foxes.
“ But the worst trouble—at any rate, to a
youngish manager, as I was, engaged to be mar-
ried —is the giving of presents. You see, the
publicans wouldn’t sell our liquor unless we regu-
larly made presents to their wives, and daughters,
and barmaids. It’s the way of the liquor-trade
everywhere. One big brewery in this city gave
away ,£20,000 last year in presents alone. And
that’s how I met my Waterloo.
“ My girl and her mother came to my office one
morning when I was out ; and waited. Both were
up-to-date, as women are nowadays and always
have been, and consequently when the ’phone
rang-up my girl answered it for me. The clerk
was away, and she did it out of kindness, as the
homely phrase is. ‘ Boss,’ came the thick voice
of a publican who did 15 years one time for
attempted murder, * a pair of fowls for my missus
on Sunday ! And, boss, can you get me a-bar-
maid—no matter how hot, so long as she don’t
steal ? ’ My girl noted down the request with
serious misgivings. Her mother, being absorbed
in a woman-suffrage treatise, did not notice, and,
therefore, did not question.
“ Ring ! went the ’phone again, and my girl
jumped up quickly, fearing another strange mes-
sage, and fearing equally that her mother might
get hold first. ‘Air ye there! blayguard?’
shrieked Mrs. O’Grady. ‘ Oi’m puttin’ me Sun-
day dress on to come down an’ tell yer board of
directhors about yer conduct! Ye’ll ’ave a showin’-
up, take my word for it.’ The vindictive scream
of Mrs. O’Grady pierced my girl to the core, and
she sat down near the ’phone and tried to reason
with her fears as she waited for the next discovery.
It came soon enough. ‘lt’s Lucy,’ laughed a
frisky voice; ‘What about the gloves, dear?’
* You won’t get them,’ my girl answered sharply.
Her mother looked up and as sharply asked,
‘What is it?’ ‘Nothing,’ answered the girl,
and tried her best to suppress the suspicion that
would rise against me. But the practised eye of
the match-maker perceived trouble, and from that
on she took hold of one receiver, and noted down
the memoranda in this form :
Flossie wants tan gloves : you know the size.
Susie wants a sable : you can put it on.
Mary wants a bracelet: you can put it on.
Emily wants perfume : wall-flower: ducky.
Nea wants a brooch : and three kisses : one on each cheek
and the third where you like.
Becky wants hair combs : nice ones.
Jenny wants silver hair-brush : love.
Polly wants silver-handled parasol—for you and me.
Mrs. O’Smyth wants dress-ring.
Jennv wants opera-cloak—£4 one will do.
Mrs. Dobbs wants tailor-made gown.
Mrs. Dooley wants petticoat— laoe one—has stopped it
out of account.
My girl’s mother wrote down this list with the
satisfied relish with which old ladies discover
anything against men. And at intervals she pro-
nounced me ‘a brute, as all men are.’ My girl
did not answer; her heart was checked and sad,
and longing for my return. When I did arrive
my intended mother-in-law tackled me hard.
‘ls this ’ —pointing scornfully at the list —‘ is this
the Shah of Persia’s harem ? ’
“ I told the truth about it. Explained that the
traveller, in going round that morning, had made
all sorts of promises in the hope of pushing trade.
My girl’s mother pierced me with a glance of keenest
irony. ‘Oh ! ’ she said, ‘ indeed ! Of course it is
the traveller. A man always blames somebody
else. A man never pleads guilty.’ And, turning
instantly to her daughter, the match-maker in her
became merged in the woman-suffragist, and she
held forth in hysterical tones, ‘M.y dear Mab,
forewarned is forearmed ! Unless you can become
the only wife, never marry. It is iniquitous, but
it is true. Marriage means that you, unfortun-
ately, will be one of a number. And, unlike
those of the number who have their liberty and the
right to speak their mind, you will be the poor
wretch under a man’s great, cruel thumb. If his
Susie or his Flossie or his Becky or his Polly give
him offence he cannot harm them—he can only
refuse presents. But as for the poor one whom he
has the legal right to call his wife—he can starve
her, beat her, keep her in rags. And what can
she do ? Weep her heart out, poor girl, or else
sue for separation or divorce. Which means pub-
licly exposing her misery to the mockery of a
callous world. The men, being-, all brutes, will
sympathise with him, while the women will laugh
and say, * The booby ! I knew she couldn’t hold
his love. Ah, my dear, a woman never realises
how down-trodden her sex is until she marries !
She is utterly dependent on one man, then. And
after years of ill-treatment at his hands, then, if
she does not feed and flatter the brute, he will
take all her pin-money and pay a cook with it.’
“ ‘O’ill ’av ’is heart!’ shrieked Mrs. o‘Grady
as that 2751b5. of Irish hot fired into the room.
‘ Now ! ’ she yelled, shaking her big red fist in
my face, ‘ it’s between ye an’ me. O’ill ’av six
pairs o’ silk stockin’s, open-wurrked, out o’ ye, or
by the saints uv heaven it’s to h—l wi’ ye an’ yer
board of directhors, an’ yer beer goes inty the
gutther ! ’
“Next moment I was alone with Mrs. O’Grady
to battle it out. I did that. But never was I
able to reconcile my girl to me. I tell myself it’s
for the best, but, all the same, I’m a bald-headed,
miserable brewer.”
S. A. MILLS.
Two Little Women,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“CtAd! that was a near thing the other night,
Little Woman ! How did you manage to explain
it?”
“ Yes, wasn’t it 1 He was positive he saw youi
arm around my waist—threatened divorce, shoot-
ing, and all sorts of things. However, even my
conscienoe didn’t make a fool of me. I declared,
in my most tragic manner—you know you often
tell me I ought to have been an actress —that if he
insulted me by even thinking me capable of such
things, I would refuse to live under the same roof
with him, and save him the trouble of turning me
out.”
“ And did that bring him round? ”
“Oh, yes! that and a few tears, and some
kisses. The kisses were the hardest part of all to
me.”
The man had sufficient grace to murmur
mentally, “ Poor chap ! ” Aloud, he said, “ Well,
you are a marvellous Little Woman ! ”
And their laughter was drowned in many kisses.
* * * *
In course of time the man married. He should
have known better, for he was no longer young.
Besides, he made the mistake which few men of
his sort make, and married a galloping girl. At
first, the possibility of his wife preferring others
never entered his head. But, in due time, the
übiquitous “ other chap ” appeared on the scene,
in the simple fashion peculiar to other chap--.
Then someone sounded a warning-note, and the
man understood.
Mad with rage, he confronted his young wife,
and hurled the ugly accusation. Trembling, but
game, she stood bravely to her guns, and worked
them to such purpose that soon the enemy’s fire
ceased. She had almost added one more triumph
to the countless brilliant achievements of woman
in this direction, when, betwixt kisses and tears,
she cried, “Oh, Jack! How could you think
such things of me? If you ever do so again, I
shall refuse to live.with ”
But here the tide of battle set against her, for,
from some remote chamber of memory, the man
heard a voice asking, “And did that bring him
round?” And a softer, brighter one, “Yes . . .
the kisses were the hardest part! ” And the echo
that had lived all these years woke the demon
within the man anew. Which was hard luck for
a plucky Little Woman.

“ I have used Ayer’s Sarsaparilla in my family for years with the most satis-
factory results.
“During the warm, debilitating days of summer it acts as a tonic and seems
to build up the system and restore the appetite. *
“ I have always given it to my children, whose photograph I send you with
this letter, for any disorder of the blood, and, in fact, for all diseases peculiar
to children.
“ I have found it greatly improved their health by getting at the root of the
disorder quicker than any other preparation.”
These are the children of Mr. and Mrs. Morrall W. Curran, of Bowen Hills,
Brisbane, Queensland. Mr. Curran sends us this strong testimonial. It shows
again why the people have named Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
‘The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
The old and young alike are cured with Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, for it is a family
medicine. Give a few doses to the children any time they have indigestion,
sleeplessness, loss of appetite, headache, or general weakness. If they are pale
and thin, or have any rashes or pimples, they certainly need it. If you wish
the cure to be prompt, and if you wish it to last, be sure and use “ Ayer’s.”
There is nothing “Just as Good.”
