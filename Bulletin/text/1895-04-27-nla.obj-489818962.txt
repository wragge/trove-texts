HE “KEEPER” PILE PILL
(Registered).
The PROPRIETORS of these Pills are well aware that
there are many r medies (some of them really, beneficial)
for this painful disease already in the market, hut know-
ing as I hey do the wonderful success of the “ KEEPER ”
PILL they have no hesitation in placing it in the very
front rank of Curative Medicines.
For years the medicine had only a local and limited
use, but now arrangements have been completed to make
its merits more widely known, and the Australasian
colonies will have an opportunity of sharing with the old
country the benefits of this valuable remedy.
The medicine will be sold on its merits, in confident
assurance that its beneficent action will be a real boon to
sufferers.
It will not cure Piles in old and chronic cases by a single
dose. It will not cure every disease that flesh is heir to,
but it will cure Pih-g if taken in reasonable time, and
IT WILL GIVE RELIEF IN ALL CASES,
however stubborn and chronic, and the proprietors are
continually in receipt of most flattering and unsolicited
testimonials. Price, 2 6 per box (red label).
The “KEEPER” LIVER PILL.
We constantly find cases of Hemorrhoids which are
complicated with liver trouble, and we have therefore
perfected a Liver Pill to be used alone, or in conjunction
with the “ Keeper” Pile Pill. We do not claim tor this,
or for any of our preparations, any marvellous curative
properties. We simply advise you, if suffering from slug-
gish or torpid liver, to spend 1/3 in a box of “ KEEPER"
LIVER PILLS (blue label) and you will not regret it.
The “KEEPER” HEALTH PILL.
If you are worried in business, if you are jaded by over-
work, if you are generally run down from any cause, TRY
THIS PILL. It is a prince of pick-me-ups. In one size
only (brown label), 6 6 per box.
The title the “KEEPER” PILL is registered as our
trade mai k throughout the colonies, and any infringement
thereof will be promptly dealt with by the sole proprietors,
The JOHN F. TAVI/Olt COMPANY.
Head Office for Australasia: 409 Collinsstreet, Melbourne,
Victoria.
Notice.—-The John F. T iylor Co. will send a sample box
of 1 KEEPER” PILE PILLS to any address in Austral-
asia on receipt of a postal order for 2 6 ; the “ KEEPER ”
LIVER PILL for 13; the ‘'KEEPER” HEALTH PILL

A BIG BIZ!
Our Trade is Big I Our Store Is Big I
Our Ideas are Bigl
We get bigger every day; on Saturday night
we are bigger than on the previous Monday,
and on the Wednesday following we are bigger
still. We can’t help growing. We have all the
elements of growth. The soil we are planted in
is good, the climate propitious, the people kind.
We are continually watered by the lifegiving
showers of a nation’s approval. Can anyone
wonder that we grow?
Our growth is a wonderful thing. People
describe it as magical. There is no magic in it.
Anyone; or any set of people, can do the same if
they do as we have done. But they don’t; they
can’t find the way, charge too much for the privi-
lege of doing business with them, and generally
and dep'orahly make a mess of the whole affair.
That’s the mischief.
Most People Like Us! All Believe in Us I
Not a Pew Swear by Usl
It’s cupboard love. We suit them, make their
money go a lung way, and generally render the
path of life an easy one. There’s no sentiment
about it. It’s real biz, and no mistake. In that
way we are beloved throughout Australia, the
measure of affection each one bestows upon us
being ganged by the amount of benefit received.
The more you buy at our store the greater your
liking fur us will become, because the more you
invest with us the better dividends you receive.
If living IN THE COUNTRY, send for our
Catalogue and Patterns of anything you require;
if in town, call every day.

Itching Skin Humors
Torturing , Disfiguring Eczemas
And every species of itching, burning, bleeding, scaly, crusted, pimply,
and blotchy skin and scalp diseases are relieved in the majority
of cases by a single application, and speedily, permanently and
economically cured by the Cuticura
Remedies when the best physicians,
hospitals, and all other remedies fail.
No language can exaggerate the suf-
fering of those afflicted with these dis-
eases, especially of little babies, whose
tender skins are literally on fire.
CUTICURA
Remedies are the greatest skin
cures, blood purifiers, and humor reme-
dies of modern times, are absolutely
pure, and agreeable to the most sensi-
tive, and may be used on the youngest
infant and most delicate invalid with
gratifying and unfailing success.
CUTICURA, the great skin cure, instantly allays
the most intense itching, burning, and inflamma-
tion, permits rest and sleep, heals raw and ini
tated surfaces, cleanses the scalp of crusts and scales, and restores the hair. Cuticura
Soap, the only medicated toilet soap, is indispensable in cleansing diseased surfaces.
CUTICURA Resolvent, the new blood and skin purifier and greatest of humor reme-
dies, cleanses the blood of all impurities, and thus removes the cause. Hence, the
Cuticura Remedies cure every humor of the skin, scalp, and blood, with loss of hair.
4®“ <! llow to Cure Diseases of the Skin and Blood,”64 pages, 300 Diseases, 50 Illus-
trations, 100 Testimonials, is wrapped around every botlle of the Cuticura Resolvent.

Pimply Skin

are prevented and cured by Cutlcura Soap, in-
comparably the greatest of skin purifiers and beautifiers,
while rivalling in delicacy and surpassing in purity the most expensive of toilet and nursery soaps-
The only medicated toilet soap and the only preventive and cure of inflammation and clogging ol
the pores, the cause of pimp'es. blackheads, rough, red. and oilv skin ad rim-'le humors of infants.

‘A GOLDEN SHANTY.’
The Voices of the Se a.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Sea goes singing round the earth
Her music to the muon ;
The words are said by the drowned dead,
And the four winds set the tune.
’Tis a lullaby on a coral isle
Where the gulls, in a lazy sweep,
Skim over the calm, and the windless paltn
Watches the Sea asleep.
She is taking a rest from labours past
While the wandering winds are dumb,
She is gathering breath for a run with Death,
In the wakening time to come.
But her slumber is harried with secret cares,
And the Sky has a sister’s grief
For the sinister roll of the burdened soul
That frets on the sunken reef.
The day goes sorrowing out of sight
At the guilt of the Sea’s unrest,
And the frightened birds at her dream-dropt words
Scream out in the grim sou’-west.
The hurricane sends a hasty gust,
The waters are troubled and white,
And under the lash of the lightning flash
They scatter across the night.
They fling at the vane of a frightened ship,
They grip on the keel below,
Till the timbers strain with a wrestler’s pain
Who feels his overthrow.
The wind out-roars the roaring men,
The striving halyards moan,
When the main-yard dips, as she staggers and
trips
In the waltz of the mad cyclone.
And over the horror the levin plays,
And gleams on the heeling deck,
Wtien the bows are deep in a raking sweep,
And fore-and-aft is wreck.
And then the red of a ruinous dawn
Where greedy breakers roar,
And four men reel at a break-away wheel
To claw from a dead leeshore.
But all is lost save cables twain,
And these part one by one ;
A pause and a drift and the Sea’s short shrift —
Ask Her how the deed is done !
On what she sings to the ghostly moon
I have pondered deep and long ;
I have learnt her speech to the lonesome beach
And I know by heart her song.
I hear her whisper between the piles
Her feats of by-gone years ;
She ripples boasts of wreck-strewn coasts
And clinging women’s tears.
Mournful and drear is the midnight deep
When silver moonbeams fall
In threads of light on the cloak of night,
Like lace on a velvet pall.
When shoals of ghastly shapes arise
In immortelles decked round,
And the Miserere of Death’s despair
Is chanted by the drowned.
.Why has the song such under-tones
To sadden the listening moon ?
The words are said by the drowned dead,
And the four winds set the tune.
Alas ! for the women who wake to weep -
_• At the haunting roar of the sea . . ,
“Each parting soul of the lives I stole
Has yielded his voice to me.”
Alas ! for the chill on joyous hearts
That hear the voices grim ...
“ My rolling waves are naught but graves,
My song is a funeral-hymn !”
Try, if ye can, to forget your grief,
And try to love again,
Dream into rest on a new love’s breast
Despite the Sea’s dead men.
'Tis only the breaking wave on the cliff :
’Tis only the breeze at play
Caressing your head—not the hand of the dead—
Why do ye turn away ?
The groom is waiting the binding word,
And how should the bride be pale?
What has she heard —that a ghostly third
Should stand at the altar rail ?
’Tis only a louder wash on the beach
In the joy of the golden noon
But the words are said by the drowned dead,
And the four winds set the tune.

SATURDAY, APRIL 27, 1895.
The Japanese Bogey.
The Chinese bogey, which has done so much
service in the cause of Australian militarism,
has collapsed. Japan has doubled up the
Mongol Empire like a wet rag, and now there
is hardly anyone on this earth so humble as
to be scared by the old stories about the
prowess of the people of the Flowery Land.
The oft-told tales about the days to come,
when the Chinese legions will over run the
earth, have dropped into oblivion. The hazy
narratives concerning that great ironclad
fleet which was to issue forth, some day or
other, from the Yellow Sea, and swoop down
on Sydney and Melbourne, and either exact
a huge ransom.or lay these cities in ashes,
and about the military hordes which were to
annex this continent, have evaporated. For-
mally years that prophetic narrative turned
up in the public imagination at regular and
irregular intervals. The moral which it
always bore was that a great danger could only
be averted by prayer and strict grovel and
a liberal expansion of the military expendi-
ture, and by the importation from England
of many high-priced colonels and major-
generals, and by Easter manoeuvres, and a
1 wish contribution to the Auxiliary Squadron,
and consistent loyalty to the Empire, and
the sending forth of another Soudan Con-
tingent at the earliest opportunity. And
now all this is over. China has burst like an
over-grown fungus, and the story of what
she was going to do some time or other has
become extinct. It was an interesting old
legend, and its absence creates a void.
Peace unto its ashes !
• • *
The Chinese bogey died about two months
ago, and before it was decently interred the
Japanese bogey arose in its stead. And this
one also can only be laid by loyalty and
patient grovel, and by increasing the naval
subsidy, and doubling or trebling the defence
vote, and importing more guns and major-
generals, and encouraging the cadet-corps,
and having four times as many colonels as
we have already, and, above all, by being
loyal to the Empire. There are 40,000,000
Japanese or thereabouts. They have shown
themselves good soldiers, good sailors, and
clever traders and artificers ; they are brave,
industrious, ingenious, enterprising ; they
are establishing large and prosperous manu-
factures and are competing hard with Euro-
pean nations for the commerce of Eastern
Asia. Therefore an alarmed bagman writes
to the Sydney press announcing that this
newly-risen nation intends to expel British
and Australian ships from these seas, and
that it proposes to conquer Australia and
Maoriland, and is hungering for a blood-
thirsty conflict with the whole British Em-
pire. And the Pall Mall Gazette points
out that the danger is so immense that,
whereas Australia now pays £130,000 an-
nually towards the cost ot the British fleet,
it ought in future to pay £3,000,000 at the
■very least. Also, the rest of the British
press holds forth in the same strain, and the
more Jingoistic section of the Australian
press takes up the parable, and another good
old war-scare is in active preparation.
* * *
So far, there is no visible reason for all
this excitement, save the invariable reason
that a number of tawdry military persons
want to enhance the dignity of their position,
and that the Jingo is always with us. Japan
is no more dangerous to Australia than she
was a year, or several years, ago. Siie is
very little more dangerous than Chili or the
United States has been any time within
the last two decades. She has a respect-
able navy and a good army ; so have
Russia, France, Germany, the United
States, Chili, Brazil, and a dozen other
countries. If she chooses to turn them both
against Australia she will probably make
serious trouble ; so will any of the others
under the same circumstances. So far, how-
ever, despite the letter of the infuriated
bagman and the cries of a section of the
daily press, Japan shows no earthly sign of
wanting to fight with Britain, or to annex
Australia, or to sweep anybody’s peaceful
ships from the seas, or to quarrel with any-
body. She has wiped up (he earth with the
Chinese in one or two small disagreements
in previous times, and for many years past
.‘lu has apparently been fully confident of
her ability to do it again if required. Yet
she only went to war after 30 years of con-
tinuous insult from the inflated mandarins
of Pekin. As far as her recent history
shows, Japan is a peaceful and long-suffering
State, and about the least likely of all States
to go pervading the earth in search of
remote and needle ;s enemies. She has no
quarrel with Australia, and Australia has
none with her ; also, the two countries are
far apart and have little communication.
Altogether, the latest scare, such as it is,
is a pitiable exhibition of cowardice and
stupidity.
• • •
The source of almost all Australia’s peri-
odical war-scares is the Imperial Federation
party in England and Australia, and the
object in every case is to boom the good
cause of Imperial “unity.” Britain is the
centre of a bloated and top-heavy empire
which straggles over the five divisions of the
globe. Her frontiers, in one place or
another, are coterminous with nearly every
possible enemy with Russia, China,
Afghanistan, the United States, Germany,
France, Spain, Italy, Turkey, and various
others. Every separate province of the
empire must take its chance of the mother-
country or of some other province dragging
it into a ruinous war with any or all of these
foreign states. Also, every separate pro-
vince supplies trade for the British merchant,
and a field for the investment of British
capital, and helps to make Britain the great
trading and money-lending nation of the
world. Therefore, it is to the interest of
Britain to keep the loose, shambling empire
together, that it may continue to supply
trade for her merchants-and interest for her
capitalists, lb-is also her interest tp.induce
the outlying provinces to supply military
and naval forces to defend her commerce,
and protect her invested capital, and help to
scare off her enemies, and bear a hand
generally. To this end Britain longs after
an Imperial Federation, with a Federal
Parliament in which all the white races of
the empire will be represented on a popula-
tion basis, so that the British majority may
enact that the “colonies ' 1 shall supply men
and money to help in her wars and shall
offer themselves up on the altar of. “ loyalty.”
A good many renegade Australians join in
these unholy aspirations, and endeavour to
assist the cause by pointing out how all man-
ner of possible and impossible enemies are
waiting to fall upon and devour the country,
and how the catastrophe can only be averted
by loyalty, and a constant readiness for
bloodshed, and a humble and abject devotion
to the H’empire.
* *
So far nothing in particular has resulted
from this policy. The Russian terror has
lived and died and been resurrected off and
on for a number of years, and various
drapers in the Victorian Defence Depart-
ment have made themselves look especially
foolish over it on sundry occasions. The
Chinese bogey led a bloated and precarious
existence for a long while until itfe.l through
the other day. Various awful rumours of
French and German invasion have shaken
the community for half a day, and then
evaporated. The Japanese panic, for some
reason or other, has failed to get any serious
hold on the great mass of the population,
despite sundry alarming local articles about
the “new Power which has risen in the
East,” and the enthusiastic whooping of the
British press. The principal consequences
of the Imperial Federation movement,
after many years hard and persistent scare, •
were that the late W. B. Dalley ordered,
on his own responsibility, a large stock of
warlike munitions, which were paid for with
extreme difficulty by his successors, and
which are still rusting and mouldering some-
where —no one knows exactly where. There
is no visible reason to believe that any
foreign country seriously wants Australia at
present. The attempts at distant conquest
made of late by great European States have
mostly panned out badly—so badly as to
show that even the largest and most
ferocious of States is exceedingly help-
less in conducting campaigns far from its
base of supplies. Also, the Great Powers
are mostly employed watching each other,
and each one has its own bogey preying on
its mind, and half of them hardly know of
Australia’s existence. Among all these cir-
cumstances, it is just possible that this
country, if it abjures Imperial Federation,
and doesn’t call attention to its name and
address by sending out more Soudan Con-
tingents, may escape European aggression,
as so many feeble South American republics
have done, for many years to come —possibly
for many centuries.
/ * * *
Meanwhile, it is advisable for Australia to
be prepared, as far as possible, for the danger
that must arise some time or other. And
the best way to prepare is to get rid, when-
ever circumstances admit, of that British
connection which gives us a share in half the
quarrels and complications of Europe, Asia,
Africa and America; to have a Federal
militia which will have as little military
pomp and as much knowledge of plain,
accurate shooting as possible ; to have Aus-
tralian instead of hired foreign officers,
and to keep them, if possible, for work
instead of for unsavory court-martial pur-
poses ; and, if a navy is essential, to have a
small Federal fleet manned by Australians,
instead of a 5 per cent, interest in a bor-
rowed foreign squadron commanded by
foreign officers. And it is further advisable
that Australia should have no foreign policy,
should interfere in nobody's quarrels, should
say as little as possible about her alleged
vast resources, should annex no foreign
territory, and use no needless belligerent
language to anybody. Further, she should
cease to excite ridicule and draw needless
attention to her existence by going into
hysterics and wanting to throw up fortifica-
tions whenever some far-ofl nation scatters &
Chinese mob in Corea. Then the Australian s
days shall be long in the land which he stole
from the deceased aboriginal. /
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Of Men with Mouths and Men with Ears.
W. H. Mallock, a bad novelist and a very fair
philosopher, ingeniously argues that “ Labor
omnia vincit ”is all wrong. It should be
“ Abilitas omnia vincit;” and the very large
class of mere laboring men is quite distinct
from the very small class of able men, to whom
the large modern increase in the world’s pro-
duction) and, by consequence, the world’s
capacity to feed its laborers) is really due. No
doubt M allock’s main thesis is correct^ though
the inferences drawn from it are wrong utterly).
The collier whose soul never gets out qf the pit
when his body comes to grass, is a,s little
entitled to claim credit for the inventions of
Geordie Stephenson as the ordinary, comp, is
entitled to claim credit for the inventions of
Koster and Gutenberg. Similarly with the
whole round of handicrafts. Estimates differ ;
but probably a good half of the whole
number of existing laborers would never
have existed but for the existence of a
handful of exceptional men scattered over
the last few centuries—men whose brains so
dominated natural forces and natural oppor-
tunities as to open up channels of production
unknown or unavailable before their advent;
and with every fresh source of production a
fresh source of employment. Many, possibly
most, modern laborers owe not only the means
of livelihood, but (in the large sensq) life itself,
to the rare manifestations of an “-ability” to
whose sum total, as individuals, they have
never added one iota. This is in essence an
elaborate re-statement of The Bulletin’s argu-
ment that a man’s hob-nails are no proof of
brains ; are, if anything, a proof of absence of
brains ; since the first thing brains do for a
man is to take the hob-nails out of his
boots. Take an example of Labor’s efforts
unaided by brains the Sydney Daily
p oST _e3tablished as the organ of triumph-
ant democracy and the terror of consoli-
dated Fat Men, and dead the other day at
the age of three months —dead of starvation.
Tne fiasco wasn’t the fault of the workers who
subscribed several thousands to set the Post
afloat. Many of them made no response to
continued calls, but they did actually pay up a
good round sum—not much to start a daily
newspaper on, but quite enough to make a
decent effort with, considering that the
employes were not paid wages. But the money
was muddled away for want of brains on the
part of the Men with Mouths (alleged represen-
tativesof Labor) who took charge— spentonoffice-
rent before the paper started, spent on a throng
of parasites who were alio wed to suck the treasury
dry before a stroke of journalistic work was done.
Attheoutset.amazingenthusiasm; in themiddle,
quarrelling incapacity ; at the end, disgraceful
disaster. Everywhere the Man with the Mouth
—Labor’s favorite—out-bawling, silencing the
Man with Brains. Take another example of
Labor’s efforts unaided by brain-s—the Rue
Australian muddle which has at last found a
key—the key of an empty safe ! Again the
Man with the Mouth as prime instigator— Don
W. Lane, with plenty of brains for theory, and
none for administration'—traversing Australia
to proclaim the gospel of the New Era of
beans for breakfast, beans for dinner, and
beans for tea. Many minor men With Months
assisted him*, and the silly Labor sheep know the
voice of their typical shepherd, and follow
blindly. Despite some favorable reports, des-
pite the further passage of credulous victims,
the Rue Australian record, on the other side,
is a record of almost unrelieved failure, cul-
minating in squalid poverty. On this side it is
a record of broken promises, ruined homes,
cheated mates, and an office to which the
authentic representative of the Ruers goes to
find no cash, no books, no documents, no trace
of the thousands of hard-earned pounds sub-
scribed by the Men with the Ears, but only the
key of the empty safe aforesaid. For such is
the lot of Labor, The Mouth gurgles con-
tinually ; the Ears are always open ; but the
Brains—where are they, and what is the fate of
their owners ?
The N.S.W. Local Government Muddle
When Premier Reid first announced himself
as a believer in the system of taxation upon
unimproved land-values, a wild note of jubila-
tion went up from the Single-tax camp, and the
Single-taxers proceeded to lend much valuable
support to the new Ministry. Since then, how-
ever, the New South Wales Premier has been
growing steadily colder on the subject, until at
last his enthusiasm seems to be wholly extinct.
Certain provisions for unimproved land-value
taxation are included in the Local Government
Bill, now before the Legislature, but that
strangely and dreadfully muddled document
is thrown together in such a remarkable fashion
that great difficulty is experienced in deciding
what it means, or whether it means anything
at all. The other night, however, the Assem-
bly aw r oke to a sudden knowledge that the
promised unimproved land - value tax, at
all events, was a woeful and stupid delu-
sion. The Bill, in its present shape, pro-
vides that if the general tax is levied on
the annual rental value it shall range from
6d. to Is. in the £, and if on unimproved
capital value it shall range from Jd. to Jd.
Under the latter system land only is
taxable ; under the former, land and improve-
ments are taxable alike. Taking the province
as a whole, improvements are just about equal
to land-values, therefore one system only gives
half as much taxable property as the other.
Therefore, in a district where the whole value
of land and improvements is, say, £200,000,
the maximum tax of |d. in the £ on an unim-
proved value of £IOO,OOO will yield £312 10s.,
and the minimum of |d. will produce £lOl. 354 d.;
while the minimum tax of Is. in the £ on the
annual rental of land and improvement's com-
bined (£2oo,ooo),'estimating the rental at 5 per
cent., will yield £SOO, and the minimum of fid.
will produce £250. A motion to raise the un-
improved land-value tax to a maximum of 2d.
was rejected by the solid Government vote.
The situation, therefore, is sbmewhat as fol-
lows ; The experience of the existing munici
palities, most of which arc in serious financial
straits, shows that Is. in the £ on the
rental is the minimum which will avert
utter bankruptcy. As the unimproved value
lax only equals about half this amount, it would
mean bankruptcy wherever adopted, therefore
no«munrcipalily could afford to adopt it. There-
fore, again, the assumption is that it is not
intended to be adopted, and that it was fixed
at the present figure for the express purpose of
making its adoption impossible. The Assembly
pointed this out for eight consecutive hours,
and then Premier Reid solemnly proposed that,
instead of mak ng the new scheme workable,
it should not be applied to existing munici-
palities because it was unworkable and would
wreck their finances, and that the device which
wouldn’t answer in old municipalities should
be applied to all new ones. The House rejected
this idea with scorn and much bad language,
and the Bill went back into its former state of
chaos. Nobody knows exactly where or how
the Local Government measure is now, hut
when last heard of it was pursuing its inebriated
zig-zag very much as before.
Strychnine and Arsenic.
The death sentence on George Dean, the
alleged North Shore (Sydney) poisoner, has
been commuted to imprisonment for life. J he
decision was arrived at on the morning of the
very day on which Crick, M.L.A., proposed to
bring the matter before the Assembly, and it
was done .in such desperate haste that the
Cabinet did not even wait for the Colonial
Secretary—in whose department tire matter
lay—and two other absent Ministers ! The
reason assigned for this unwonted velocity is that
“it was deemed advisable to, if possible, come
to a decision in the matter unaffected by what
thight be stated in the Assembly.” In other
words, Crick promised to bring to light a num-
ber of startling facts which would tend to show
that the verdict was utterly wrong, and it was
considered advisable to come to a decision with-
out hearing his statements. Attorney-General
Want, who acted as prosecutor at the trial, was
present at the Cabinet meeting, and, presumably,
helped to consider the matter, thus, to a
certain extent, acting as a judge upon Ids
own case and his own conduct. The same
gentleman makes a statement in the Heralp
in defence of himself, the Judge, the jury, and
the prosecution generally. In the course of
this deliverance, however, he omits all refer-
ence to the one fact which, so far as he is con-
cerned, the public really wants to hear about.
It was practically impossible to account for the
fact of Mrs. Dean’s survival if she took the
immense quantities of strychnine and arsenic
which the analysis of her food seemed to
indicate found their way into her system,
and yet it was necessary to show that sl' e
did take them in order to avoid the ..conviction
that the samples of food, &c., had been loaded
with poison for the express purpose of analy-
sis. Attorney-General Want got over the


difficulty by pointing out that strychnine and
arsenic are antidotes to each other, and the
jury, seemingly, believed him, and reckoned
that the otherwise awful anomaly was thus
fully explained. As it happens, however,
strychnine and arsenic are not antidotes, there-
fore the jury was misled, and the difficulty
still remains, that if Mrs. Dean had been
poisoned to anything like the extent alleged,
her death was inevitable. And now the public
wants to know how Mr. Want contrived to
make this unspeakable blander, and why he
avoids all mention of it in his state-
ment of the case ? The publication, in
the Herald, of a number of testimonials
from people who report that they know abso-
lutely nothing to the discredit of Mrs. Dean’s
mother is an utterly irrelevant circumstance;
there is nobody so bad that he can’t find thou-
sands of people who know nothing to his dis-
credit. Altogether the Dean trial is about
the most inconceivable muddle on record,
and the most definite thing about it up
to date is the unanimous condemnation
of Judge Windeyek by the press of
Australia—the “respectable” S.M. Herald
being the one notable exception. No such
unanimous condemnai ion has fallen on any
Judge within the memory of this generation of
Australians, and in the face of so much public
opinion it is time for the Government to
seriously consider whether Mr. Windeyer has
exactly the temperament and qualifications
necessary to make him a desirable occupant of
the Supreme Court Bench.

The Case Stated.
The best and clearest letter written on the
Dean case up to date :
To Tub Editor or Sydney Daily Telegraph.
Sir, —There are two distinct questions of public import-
ance involved in this case—the question of the propriety
of the proceedings at the trial, and the question of Dean's
guilt. The materials for discussing the first are fairly
complete. On the second point, however, it isa pity that
the information at hand is not much fuller. Are the tol-
-1 'wing the facts? They seem to be popularly believed to
be so;
1. That there is no evidence whatever as to the pur-
chase of the poison, and that no poison was traced to
Dean’s possession.
2. That there is no evidence, except that of Mrs. Dean,
that Dean was seen to put poison in the food.
3. That there is no evidence, except that of Mrs. Dean
and her mother, that they became ill after taking the
food.
4. That the medical evidence as to the symptoms being
those of poisoning was based on the description of the
symptoms by Mrs. Dean and her mother.
5. That the doctor did not attend Mrs. Dean or her
mother while suffering from symptoms of poisoning, and
had no opportunity of directly observing the symptoms.
0. That the stomach-pump was not applied ; and that
there was no direct evidence of the presence of arsenic or
strychnine in Mrs. Dean's body.
7. That the only poison found was in Mrs. Dean’s
excreta, and in unoonsnmed remnants of food and drink.
S. That, as to the food, there is no evidence (except Mrs.
Dean’s) to show that the poison could not have been put
in after she partook of it.
9. That, as to the poison in the excreta, there is no evi
deuce (except Mrs. Dean's) to show that it could not have
been put there.
10. That there is no scientific evidence that the poison
in the excreta had passed through a human (or other)
body.
11. That the quantity of poison in the’ food and drink
was so great as to make it improbable that anjone could
partake of it without fatal results.
12. That the quantity of poison in the excreta was so
great as to make'it improbable that it could have parsed
throui/h a human body wi Iwut cauniny death.
Any agitation for Dean's release should be has d on a
knowledge of the facts of the case. 1 am one of many
who feel anxious to have trustworthy information. Mr.
Justice Windeyer’s notes of the evidence should certainly
be published, either privately or by the Government.
They would enable us to check the ex parte version of the
case which is most prominently before the public, and
which is possibly misleading.
I would again point out that this matter is quite distinct,
and should be kept distinct, from the question as to the
course taken by the Judge at the trial,—Yours, etc.,
Examiner.
An old Grievance rtetold.
The clumsy and violent efforts which are being
made to attract the unseeing eye and the un-
hearing ear of the New South Wales Executive
to the case of George Dean are further
evidences, where there is already evidence
enough and to spare, that the criminal law re-
quires fixing on an entirely new basis. The
public efforts are clumsy, because the law pro-
vides no machinery whereby a glaring wrong
may lie redressed, and they are violent because
the only means of effectually drawing attention
to the matter is by shrieking, in a deafening
key, at the stony head of the Cabinet. Any
case concerning “ property ” —even a very small
amount of property —can be heard and reheard,
and carried on appeal from one court to another;
in a ease concerning human life the law practi-
cally allows for one hearing only, and even if
that ends in a brutally and obviously unjust
decision, the case, so far as the law is concerned,
ends there. The after-processes are mostly
a matter of chance. The Cabinet considers
the decision in the light of the Judge’s report,
but it doesn’t hear the prisoner, so if a wrong
has been done by the Bench, it is only the
person who did the wrong who is heard ; the
person who suffered it is absent in the con-
demned cell. A system of appeal in cases re-
lating to property, where provision was made
for hearing one side only, would be scouted as
an infamy ; in cases involving human life the
public takes it as a matter of course, except
when it is suffering froma spasmodicburstof fury
regarding some particular victim, and even then
it only concerns itself with that particular victim,
and troubles itself very little about the iniquitous
system. The Cabinet considers the matter in
secret; no doubt it does consider it—nr one
side of it, anyhow—in most cases with extreme
care, though with very little trained intelligence;
but, all the same, it is not compelled to consider
it. It isn’t bound to give any reason for its deci-
sion, or to show how, or on what evidence, or
misconception of the evidence, or want of
evidence, it was arrived at. ''The Cabinet, as a
point of etiquette, usually declines to interfere
unless some new facts are forthcoming. The
old facts may be plainly quite inadequate proof
of the prisoner’s guilt; they may have been
glaringly distorted by the Crown prosecution or
foolishly mismanaged by the prisoner’s cheap
and inexperienced counsel; but no rehearing is
allowed. In a civil case involvinga few pounds
a new trial may be obtained on the ground that
the decision was against the weight of evidence,
but no such privilege is allowed in a
criminal case, no matter how serious it
may be. And, even if there is every reason
to believe that any number of new facts
may be found by a very slight search, the
Government or the Crown Law Department
doesn’t, as a rule, even profess to look for them;
the prisoner in his condemned cell can’t look
for them himself ; and the only chance is that
some private individual who is sympathetic
enough to attack the matter at his own cost,
and brainy enough to unravel it, and sufficiently
clamorous and persistent to compel a hearing,
and sufficiently influential to lead a big public
movement, will take it up. And such men are
scarce. At the present time W. P. Crick,
M.L.A., is pretty nearly the only criminal
court of appeal in New South Wales, and when
he dies or drops out of politics there will pro-
bably be no court of appeal at all.
A “ Bob ” a Day!
William Poster, one of the men killed by the collapse of
the Spottiswoode sewer, under the river Yarra, at Melh.,
had been at underground work for the time on the
day of the accident. One of the face-men was
absent through illness, and Foster implored Mr.
Kobe, the contractor, to let him work below on
account of the extra shilling a day piid for the risk.
Foster was a married man with several children, and had
been in destitute circumstances for some time past. -
Ae m Item.
Editor Bulletin, —Some person in authority
is alleged to have said of the just-closed Brough-
Boucicault season at Sydney Lyceum that “ it
has been grievously disappointing from the
commercial standpoint,” whereupon Sydney
Telegraph comments that the fault lies with
the plays produced, which do not suit the Aus-
tralian taste. I am decidedly of opinion that
the fault lies with the Australian taste. Plays
like “Mrs. Tanqueray,” “Rebellious Susan,”
and “ Lady Windermere’s Fan ” (to name three
out of many admirably staged and acted) are
good enough for anybody. They are too good
for the average Australian city-person, whose
“taste” runs to spectacular trash like “A
Million of Money,” or feeble farce like “Char-
ley’s Aunt,” or exhibitions of legs and black
faces. To say this is not to unduly dis-
parage the intelligence-standard of Sydney
or Melbourne, which support clever drama at
least as well as any place of similar popu-
lation elsewhere. Brains are scarce every-
where ; but we produce as much of the
commodity, proportionately, as London or New
York. Apparently we don’t yet produce
enough to give managerial enterprise an
adequate reward. Why not acknowledge the
fact with regret, instead of blaming Pinero,
Jones, Wilde, and co., for writing plays which
most of us are intellectually incapable of
appreciating? The Telegraph critic finds
fault with their subjects ; but it is not sub-
ject, but treatment, which makes a play
interesting and valuable. How many for-
gotten playwrights have handled Shakes-
pere’s subjects? Does Shakespere —the first
of dramatists—get better patronage in Aus-
tralia than Pinero, and does the fault lie with
Shakespere? If the Brough-Boucicault Co.
staged “School for Scandal” or “Money,”
Vould they attract to these brilliant classical
plays audiences half as large as Bland Holt or
George Rignold can attract to a chaos in forty-
five tableaux, with a real race-horse and a paste-
board railway-engine and a libretto of grandi-
loquent slush ? And if they would not, as the
Telegraph person knows they would not, why
print variegated moon-talk about the superiority
of Australian audiences to English playwrights?
—S.B.
N.S.W. Leg. Council has strangled the Bill to
reduce the next Governor’s salary from .£7OOO
to ,£5OOO. With the Govt, against them, the
Assembly retrenchers must accept the snub
in so far as the alteration of the Constitution
Act is concerned. They can take their revenge
by holding Premier Reid to his promise to cut
off the allowances—a promise, the effect of
which he will try to minimise as much as pos-
sible. To reduce both salary and allowances
is perhaps too hopeful a Democratic dream at
present. It is sufficient if the allowances go
now : at the salary, Parliament can come
again and cut till it reaches .a reason-
able figure. Meanwhile, for the private
secretary and his understrappers, for the
aide-de-camp and his understrappers, and for
all-embracing contingencies, the Assembly is
usually asked to vote £2400. It can save £2OO0 r
there easily, and snap its fingers at the Council,
by simply refusing to vote the money. The
Moss Vale house—that sink of expenditure—
should be knocked off in addition. One house
is enough for the community to provide. Let
the next N.S.W. Governor find his own summer
residence, as the Governor of Queensland has
to do. Or, at all events, let the Governor dip
his hands in his own pocket for the continual
re-furnishing and alterations —which the Assem-
bly gets no opportunity of criticising. Another
£lOOO a year can be saved here. Premier Reid
will assuredly want to dodge the saving. Par-
liament should assuredly hold him to it.
H. K. Rusden entertained a few choice speci-
men Tories at the Melbourne Reform Club, the
otherday, withapaperonPoliticalCapacity. The
present condition of Victoria, Rusden explained,
is the result of manhood suffrage, payment of
members, and high protective duties, which
evils testify to a lack of political capacity abso-
lutely appalling. Land-booms and the Davies-
Munro system of banking, also farthing com-
positions and the dishonesty prevalent among
“ leading members of the church ” —in short,
everything that has tended to upset Smell-
bourne’s commercial liver —spring from man-
hood suffrage. No man, said the valuable
Rusden, should be allow ed to vote until he has
arrived at the age of 35, when he is fit
to vote in one or more places just accord-
ing to his property - qualifications for the
franchise. Rusden, moreover, advocated a
very small, select Parliament—not more than
15 members. With a House of that size, elected
mainly by the larger property owners, Victoria
would have no fits of depression, no strikes, no
income-tax, no protective duties, no anything
likely to disturb Fat Man’s peace of mind.
Thus far the country has been ruined by a
scandalous diffusion of voting-power and the
admission of unwealthy persons into Parlia-
ment. Bank and building society frauds, law-
yers’ embezzlements, and all matters of that
description are instigated by the ignorant
working classes, inasmuch as the majority
of unenlightened voters under 35 years
of age are earning a living by the sweat
of their brows. Thus Mr. H. K. Rusden,
at the Reform Club. Most of his brother re-
formers agreed with all he said, being well over
35 and ardent Freetraders to a man. But
Moule, M.L.A., was not in favor of abolishing
manhood suffrage, or rather, he thought its
abolition impracticable. Manhood suffrage had
come to stay, “and the only thing now to be
done,” said this comparative Democrat, “ was
to combat the one-man-one-vote proposal.” It
goes almost without saying that a Madden —
Walter of that ilk—took the chair on this
historic occasion, and shed a superior autocratic
family smile upon the proceedings,
Victoria rejoices in the possession of a vestas-
factory,and the local Tories are extremely jubilant
over the alleged failure of Protection to secure
the operatives high wages. The fact that the tax
was not imposed by Protectionists is, of course,
carefully ignored. It is because Fat Man hates
vestas that they were taxed. Wax matches are
blamed for most bush-fires—and the squatters
worked the Legislature a few’ sessions ago to
encourage the use of safeties. The tax on wax
matches resulted. A more or less enterprising
manufacturer sought out Victoria and built a
factory. The Tories now call on Protec-
tionists to explain this factory and its
wages-sheet. If it is an undesirable
addition to the industries of Victoria the Pro-
tectionists are free from blame. If it is a
desirable addition Protectionists will secure
it any further protection necessary to
tide it over its initial difficulties. As
regards the wages of the operatives, one clear
stipulation is open for enactment, and The
Bulletin (sails on all Tories, Freetraders, and
Anti-Socialists to establish a minimum wage
for protected industries. This would be wel-
comed by Protectionists, because so many
importers have become protected manufacturers
and have brought their monopolistic methods
with them that the artisans need tlie safeguard.
If an industry is such that it cannot pay a
decent wage, then it must go. But The Bul-
letin knows that 99 per cent, of the protected
industries would survive the minimum wage,
and flourish the better for it.
New South Wales Legislative Council’s shelving
for six months of the Governor’s Reduction of
Salary Bill becomes, under a ruling of that body
in March last, an absolute rejection of the Bill,
without affording the Assembly that advantage
which the ordinary Parliamentary rejection of
the Bill would have supplied. Had the Council
formally or after, discussion rejected the Bill, or
loaded it with mangling amendments, the pre-
sent Legislative Assembly could have re-affirmed
its old policy and sent the Bill back again, but,
by shelving it for six months, the Council
deprives the Assembly of this recognised
right to compromise or protest, and con-
demns the Legislature to silence on the
topic for that period. And this is not all.
Last September the Navigation Bill was
hung up similarly for six mouths ; and when at
the expiry of that term it was called on, the
President of the Council ruled, acting on some
newly-discovered precedent of the British Par-
liament, that a motion to read a Bill that day
six months meant the discharge of the Bill ;
and he accordingly discharged the Bill in hand.
No means was then taken to test the Presi-
dent’s ruling ; it was admitted to be new, but
was let pass. The outcome of it will, however,
obviously be the formation of a new and dan-
gerous line of tactics by Legislative Councils
in New South Wales and elsewhere ; for when-
ever a peculiarly objectionable measure is
sent up by a Lower House, the Upper
House may shelve it away out of the reach
of debate for six months, then discharge
it, and if the Assembly be still in a position to
re-introduce it, may simply repeat the pro-
cess, without arguing the measure publicly
or giving the Lower House an opportunity
to further discuss it. The Navigation Bill was
the first on which this new rule was tried, and
now the application of the same policy to the
Governor’s Reduction of Salary Bill indicates
that its value as a piece of tactics is perceived.
The S.M. Herald has been at its old game of
suppression, for the purpose of minimising
public agitation. But, this time, it might as
well try to suppress thunder or bank up the
tide at Sydney Heads. The Herald disposed
of the argumentative speech of Mr. T. A. Hums,
general manager of the Commercial Banking
Co. of Sydney, at the Dean meeting w ith just
five lines. The Daily Telegraph gave him 50
lines. In twenty years, The Bulletin does
not remember any meeting of the sort having
been addressed by anyone of Mr. Dibbs’ com-
mercial standing, and when a nan in such a
position mounts the public platform to coolly
and intelligently advocate the cause of even-
handed justice, the once “leading” journal
only brings itself into contempt by trying to
gag him. Mr. Dibbs’ action is applauded by
all lovers of liberty, and level-headedness
in the administration of law, while the
Herald’s tactics in relation to the Dean
case are as cowardly and despicable as
they were in regard to the Mount Rennie so-
called trial, which bloody travesty of justice
now bids fair, after these long years, to be
avenged. Let Mr. Crick only place the mere
cold facts of the Mount Rennie trial before the
Assembly, and that cruel rape on the goddess
of Justice will be avenged. All sorts of
restraining influences—for the blood of the
lynched wretches is on many powerful hands—
will be brought to bear on the forceful member
for West Macquarie ; but The Bulletin never-
theless trusts to see him, in the light of present
events, pointing the moral of the brutal outrage
on civilisation which for eight years has cried
aloud to Heaven for vengeance.
Editor Bulletin, I see another flogging Bill
(to flog people who wear moleskins—no one who
wears good clothes is ever flogged) has passed
New South Wales Leg-Iron Council, and is
before the Assembly. Its advocates say the
police can’t keep order without the lash, more
lash—and Alfred Stephen’s bloody criminal
code staring them in the face ! Forty years ago
I served in the British navy. Flogging was of
daily occurrence, and precisely the same argu-
ment was used to justify it. “Damme, sir !
how is discipline to be kept up if you do away
with the cat? Why, the service would go to
the devil inside of eight bells if some of you
milk-and-water advocates prevailed with your
abolition views ! ” Yet flogging in the navy
was done away with, and as good discipline is
maintained now as then. Likewise in the army.
Did you ever observe the condition of a half-
roasted fowl slowly turning before the fire ?
Did you notice the discolorations and black
blotches and spots appearing? That is just
the appearance of the back of a human creature
undergoing the torture of the cat. Only you
miss the involuntary twitching and quivering
of the skin. To see that, you must go and cut
up a beast just killed—its flesh sometimes
moves just like that of the wretch at the
triangles. If the ape and tiger are not yet
dead enough in the mass of the Australian com-
munity to secure the total abolition of flogging,
let flogging take place in public. Then, once
they realised its horror, the men and women of
Sydney would tear down Darlinghurat gaol
with their naked hands rather than allow it to
continue.

The United States means to keep a tight
hand on the Nicaragua Canal. The U.S. Govern-
ment agrees to guarantee the Canal Co.’s deben-
tures for 70 million dollars for construction pur-
poses, and in return all materials used are to be
made or grown in the States, and all the directors
of the co. are to be U.S. citizens. Also, it is pro-
posed that American vessels shall have the use of
the canal at much lower rates than those of other
countries. One inevitable result is that, sooner or
later, Uncle Sam will eat up the wild-cab states of
Central America, and then devour Mexico, for the
sake of geographical uni by, and own the whole
country right down to Panama.
A “ bob ” a day !
To gaze into the fearful face of Death,
Gaunt, grim, and grey ;
To feel the chillness of his baleful breath,
A “ bob ” a day !
The patriot pimp his platitudes may give
A holiday,
When men but ask, in lieu of right to live,
A “ bob ” a day.
A “ bob ” a day
Shines like a silvern shrine before poor eyes,
And bids men pray.
Omnipotent, no heretic defies
A “ bob ” a day !
Behind, the scourge of penury swings high,
To lash and flay
Those who, too weak or too ill-placed, let by
The “ bob ” a day.
A “ bob ” a day !
To tease terrific Nature, challenging
Unequal fray,
With chances few to dodge her vengeful spring,
A “ bob ” a day !
A sullen growl—clod falls to clod,
Clay upon clay—
Six silent souls set out to seek their God
And draw His pay.
A “ bob ” a day !
With little trouble, holocaust or war
Some monster may
Provide, now lives are purchaseable for
A “ bob ” a day !
Like cattle driven to their doom in flocks
Men stumble, fey,
When human life is quoted ’midst the stocks
A “ bob” a day !

646 Macquarie-street North, Sy luey,
April 2 i, 13D5.
My Dbau Moohabivda—
The first public meeting of Sydney women (con-
vened by Mayoress Lees), to arrange a farewell to
Lady Duff, was a distinct failure—only a mere
handful of women turning up. Vagueness charac-
terised the whole thing—that dreary feeling of
when’s it going to begin? which usually pervades
women’s gatherings being especially noticeable.
Even a decision as to what farewell offering should
be made to Lady Duff was not arrived at, and I
would like to strongly advise the committee, before
launching into any expenditure, to first make
sure whether the bereaved lady for whom it is in-
tended will be likely to accept a tangible mark of
self-advertising sympathy or not. At present, no-
body knows what form it will take. Some favored
an address voluminously signed ; what was re-
garded as a brilliant suggestion was to erect a
memorial tablet of Australian stone in Fetteresso
church ; but neither suggestion took, and, after
groping round for feasible ideas, and finding
them not, the meeting sadly petered out. Another
meeting was convened for the 23rd last., which
may have better luck.
Sydney Hunt Club held a polo and sports meet-
ing at Kensington the other day, wiien S lI.C.
weather (which is almost invariably good) pre-
vailed, and everything went off cleverly except
the riders, only one of whom came to grass in the
steeplechase. Socially, the fixture suffered from a
dearth of sporting men, who were nearly all at the
annual yearling sales at Randwick, at which Mrs,
White’s little lot brought the biggest figures—
Coil fetching top price, one thousand guineas,
though I believe his owneress valued him at two
thousand. By the way, in so horsey a land as
Horsetralia it seems odd that ladies are not
admitted to the yearling-sales as they are at ’Ome,
where they sit in their carriages looking on, en-
joying and adding to the spectacle. Now the
A.J.C., an inherently conservative institution,
would only enhance its innate Hinglishimss by
being the first to issue ladies’ tickets to Randwick
sales —a compliment which the Australienne would
deeply appreciate, as she is generally just as good
a judge of a horse as she is of a man.
But all this has nothing to do with the polo
meeting, at which the audience was small and
heterogeneous, and the dressing somewhat so-so.
For it is autumn now, and yet the last robes of
summer were confidently sported. I think a
woman in a muslin gown when the leaves are fall-
ing is positively indecent, because she sets every-
body wondering if, and hoping that, she’s got
woollen tilings on underneath. One winsome
society belle, a great social favorite of the late
Governor’s, wore a velvet bodice of dahlia purple,
and moat unwisely clung for the afternoon to a
damsel with a red belt and necktie —the two colors
cheek by-jowl absolutely howled at one another.
A popular and amiable sporting widow (who held
quite a levee) in black and white only wanted a
touch of scarlet to have presented a replica of her
own racing colors ; but I resented a lady with the
new violent contrast of pink and purole in her
hat. Your style wants to be miles above reproach
before you can look ladylike sporting such a
quarrelsome combination. Guv’menlouse was
represented by Captain Feildiug in (inter aHa) a
black necktie and a dog-stealer cap. Capt,
Horace Dangar also sunned himself. I am pleased
to see that this unaffected youth, just back from
military—and I daresay other —studies in Europe,
has returned as he went, and that no ricketty
mannerisms, no spats, siiop walkereoats or crutch
sticks, no jerky Grecian-hend manner of peram-
bulating, disfigure Ids general effect. His hard
hat ami sac suit proclaimed the fact that the
effeminate modes and manners of the ladylike
Englishman have not left even a passing impres-
sion on this example to the Austral-Anglomaniac.
I can’t say I like the new baggy military
breeches I saw at the Polo. One marvellously
thin officer was certainly given needed breadth of
beam by these slop-fit continuations, but then
these baggy bags make a man look like an ad-
vanced woman from the back view—and they are
inadequate, too. What is the use of being full on
top hut tightly buttoned down below, giving the
effect of a feather-bed supported by two slate
pencils? I don’t know a woman who barracks
for the new style. All men are not Charles
Hyleys, I grant you, but surely all the well-
furnished youths are not to have a part of their
beauty sacrificed in order that the pipe-stem
brigade may present a full-blt.wn appearance above
the knee? Riding men, I notice, by the way, are
generally deficient in calf. The bicyclist tills the
feminine eye far more thoroughly in that respect.
The polo sports were entertaining. I thought
the wonder of the tlireading-tlie-needle race (when
damsels line up and do the domestic trick for the
riders) lay in the fact that a society girl knew a
needle’s eye from its business end. Thenmbrella-
and-cigar race was mildly funny, and so aas the
costume race, in which one man wore a flapping
white nightshirt, though the disguises were nut
h df so farcical as those worn at the polo gymkhana
last spring. The band played sprightly music,
and netting was deci led.y brisk —the bookies
taking heart ami roaring the odds in good old
saddling-paddock style.
The third d iy at R m 1 wick was irreproachable,
so far as the weather went, but I wasn t so struck
with the sartorial aspect of things. Jti the Lieiit.-
Gov.’s box Miss Darley and Miss Kitty Harley
wore simple suits of black and blue respectively,
with floral hats. The undoubted leaderess of
Sydney society (Mrs, E [ward Hutton) was ele-
gantly accoutred. H-r gown suggested forget-me-
nots. It was of sepia silk shot with emerald-green,
the relieving line being forget-me-nots-like velvet
picked out with pointed cream lace ; blue velvet
toque hat en suite. It was really an ideal get-up
for a bin—eyed, positively blonde woman. A
recognised belle in fluffy white chiifon sleeves added
to a wuite toilet, though disqualified from a judge’s
standpoint seemg that one looks fur Autumn
frocks at the Autumn meeting, still ma le aquaiut,
taking sort of effect. Sae looked just like the
girl who gets lithographed on the cover of the
Hug-me-in-my-dreams waltz. This pictured
beauty, yon know, is never quite up to date,
though she seems to melt iu your mouth, so to
speak.
I can’t say I admired a fleshy society matron
who copied Reryl Faber’s black and red “ Susan ”
dress as nearly as big red velvet sleeves, added to
a tight-fitting black princess robe, is copying.
Ami, talking of that delightful actress, she was on
the members’ stand, in a loose, spice-colored
suit, with an Eton collar and a studio bow, and a
wide black hat with a straggle of forget-me-nots.
Why is it. I wonder, that an actress who dresses
so tastefully on the stage generally wears such
come-hy-chance sort of frocks in public? For
instance, I never saw Mrs. Brough iu t e street
without thinking how very awkward her clothes
looked, while on the stage her beautiful dresses
were an integral p irt of her. Grace Noble wore a
neat black frock, with a squirrel round the neck,
ami a knave-of-hearts toque in coxcomb pink.
“ Miss Wiliuot ” (of the B. & B. Co.) paraded her
fianc£ and looked handsome in royal blue and
brown fur; Miss Hammond (Miss Bessie Tarrant),
also of the K. & 8., sported quaint pink hows in
her becoming hat. Dot Boiicioanlt was the only
male member of the co, who actively squired the
ladies.
Some of the dresses were positively wicked,
and f think the very worst was a bottle-green cloth
with a pink collar draped in cream-lace —large
tinsel directoire flaps on the bodice and rows of
butterfly bows lined with tinsel down each side of
the postillion back, the whole scream topped by a
two-decker toque. For side-shows, one had a
peeress’s sister in cream silk carrying on a mild
flirtation with a long, melancholy boy with a
yellow flower in his button-hole —and two of the
“smart” brigade implicated in the historic barn-
dance affair meeting and pissing one another with
unseeing glare.
The Autumn meeting of the A.J.C. ended
auspiciously on Saturday. Rindwick looked tip-
top, and if, in some instances, the lawn-ladies
were a trifle overdressed, it only suggested that
they were wearing their fineries one atop of the
other to make up for two wet, sackcloth-and-ashea
sort of days. Several leading society women
looked like mere second-hand m iterialisations of
their radiant selves on the third (lay. Butterfly
and chrysalis act, yon know, only in this case the
butterfly preceded the grub effect. One social
leader wore a very stagey dress of heliotrope
silk topped by a startled-looking toque trimmed
with violets (the little republican flower is
all the go this season), and a chiffon muffler
with big purple and mauve rosettes did not
prove becoming. A small lady, who princ : pally
relied for effect on a pair of frettul black chiffon
sleeves, suggested a Spanish fowl in a state of pro-
found agitation; but perhaps one of the strangest
sights to be seen just now is the social re-incarna-
tion of a certain frisky lady, who lias apparently
left all her “past” behind her. Even the eleventh
■commandment, “Thou shalt not he found out,”
breaks as easily as the rest, nowadays, and with
as little damage.
It is rumored, on the worst possible authority,
that a blon le beau tv is re-engaged. This time, to
a youth with a handle to his name.
While you feel grateful to society for repudiating
the five-yards-round skirt and the exaggerated
sleeves, and clinging to the dart skirt trimly
cut below, you cannot applaud the adapta-
tion of rude primal color-, which were, at one
time, quite as vulgar as a dropped aitoh, and were
generally relegated to ladies of the future Mrs.
’Awkins class. It maybe the correct thing just
now, from a milliner's point, to wear pink and
purple, blue and violet, and so on through the
whole aeries of chromatic discords —to edge pink
chiffon bows with fur, and to wear a strawberry
dress with a black velvet pelerine, and a bunch of
artificial purple flowers under your left ear—it
may be fashion, but it certainly is bad taste.
These forced unions and widely-different mate-
rials—these collisions between nerve-destroying
colors—are simply dreadful to anybody who really
feels such things.
I cannot say I liked all the little toque hats on
view at Rand wick. Some of them with foxy little
tails sticking up —parti-colored crowns and tinsel-
trimmings—looked like the sort of thing a bur-
lesque military “boy’’goes to battle in; others,
sagging off at the back, gave tbe wearer an undue
aspect of philo-progeiiitiveness. Miss Ethel Olib-
born {en parenthese, everybody was sorry to see
that Mr. Clibborn, who made a wonderful
recovery after a severe operation, was not
able to sport the glistening | linen sheep-
hurdle collar of fashion, but went for the nonce
muiiied in silk) wore an uncommon turn-out of
pink ariuure with black chiffon bodice, and white
straw hat, perkily trimmed with a ciel-blue bow
and a war of roses. Mrs. John S j e wore a quiet
dress of French grey trimmed with black moire
and jet—it is really reinarkaUe bow a quiet gown
stands out among a heap of quarrelsome colors,
which generally defeat their own object. Of
course, I mean unassertive elegance, not dow-
dyism.
Miss Ada Fosbery looked Parisian in shades of
pale grey. Miss Grace Noble’s green gown was a
good turfy color to go to the races in'; Miss
Faber wore a shagvy black jacket ami a big black
bat turned up with heliotrope, and a whole sea-gull
on top. Miss Emma Temple wore a floral dress.
M iss M‘D magh was in grey-aud-brown-checked
silk very impressively trimmed with fawn silk and
jewelled trimmings. I thought the muster of men
was very good. Perhaps the loveliest youth was
a legal sprig with the latest shape in -silk hats
and one pure white, blameless orchid in his
button-hole; the nnloveliest was the baggy-look-
ing attachment of ex-vice-regality, whose necktie
barracked for Hinglaiid in shades of dingy hue,
and who trotted a lady up and down with a tooth-
pick hanging out of his jaws !
The appearance of the Esty-Marsh English
concert co. (under the aegis of W. H. Poole) on
the platform of Sydney Town Hall, last Satur-
day, was rather an anti-climax for some of the folks
present, who had met the little band at an at-
bome, in Wynyard square, the preceding evening,
and so sized the men up as nice-looking, nioely-
mannered johnnies, and the ladies ! —but one
always kisses one’s hand to them. On the plat-
form, Miss Alice Esty (who is said to “sit down ”
on E in alt., which is a very different thing to
just tipping that lofty note) presented a fine stage
appearance. She is fair, and debuted in a white
satin gown, with silver and white Jewels
about it, and finishing touches of sap-green
velvet and a bunch of red carnations. Miss
Esty has a high, strong soprano—not sus-
ceptible of much light and shade, perhaps, but
then one cannot expect to find a Sapiu on
every programme or much feeling in every soprano
voice. Soprani sing like the birds do, with a
sound as of one who takes no thought for the
morrow. Both Miss Esty’s numbers were en-
cored. Indeed, it was a greedy audience.
Madame Enriquez was first lady. She wore
white with white feathers on her shoulders as if
her angel-wings were sprouting, and diamonds
here and there. She is small and Spanrsh-lookiug,
and became a favorite at once. Her artistic sing-
ing of Gounod’s “Worker” (she studied all his
songs under Gounod) elicited an encore. Her
second number was: similarly treated. Her con-
tralto v..ice lias f no biscions quality, still
it i- neither a hoarse Sterling baritone nor a
Patey rumble, but'' a good honest sort of voice
which would be at its beat battling in oratorio —
Madame’s favorite sphere. I believe Madame
Enriquez has never appeared on the “staige,”
owing to her rooted objection to tights. It is
significant that nearly all the platform celebrities
who gibe at fleshings are sylph-like creatures.
Mr. Cunningham sang in Sydney, as an
amateur, six years ago, when lie wasn’t so plump,
and, I dare say, not so pleasing as at present.
Encores chased Mr. C.’s placid, unforced .tenor,
though the Town Hall echo was having a night
out among the rafters; and both his solos
lengthened into four, as if the co. were making
only a one-night stand. Mr. Baritone Marsh is
also tall and fair (they are all singularly orthodox
in their dressing for musical artists —even the
tenor doesn’t give way to a turn down collar) and
was the first to elicit strong cries of approval from
the audience. His prologue from Pagliacci took
the whole audience by storm ; and the unusual
sound of “Bravo!” and applause like a million
bricks rattling down a tin staircase, brought him
back aea n. His two solos narrowly escaped
being eight. I like Mr. M. s wild warble. It im-
presses you. Herr Vollmer contributed variety
by booming out one or two classics on the ’cello,
and Herr Van V.leeti .who is a youth of a Green-
away cast of countenance and wondrous linen,
effaced himself handsomely in the accompani-
ments.
“ Paul Jones” popped up at Sydney Lyceum last
Saturday, when it struck me that the choristers’
dresses needed a fresh coat of paint, though the
s one objection doesn’t apply to the faces of the
we ir rs thereof. Bite the principals were brand-
new and have returned in excellent voice. Brass
runs wide and fiddle-strings snap, but Nellie
Stewart goes on for ever. As Yvonne, she sported
the same design in frocks, in all of which she
looked a dream of youth and loveliness. Gentle
May Pollard’s best*effect was pale pink and grey
silk with heaps of stage diamonds, and Flo Young
displayed her neat figure in the trim attire of the
phenomenally clean comic-opera lady's maid. The
chorus people —barring a much-travelled air about
some of their clothes —were as pretty as bon-bons all
through the opera. By the way, talking of the
chorus—it occurs to me that the comic-opera
“ hoy ” is ever so much more discreet, in spite 01
her long pink tights, than the ditto ditto girl.
For one thing, the former cuddles her own sex,
while the latter is hugged by the bold, bad, promis-
cuous he-supe.
Wallace Brownlow was in rich voice for Paul
Jones. As memories of Marion Burton’s ap-
pearance in those grey breeks ♦.e from the
mind, it is borne in upon me that W.
B. makes the better pirate of the two. No matter
how good a fellow a woman makes up to be, still
at the best she only suggests a “ boy ’’—Meyer a
man, and when she starts breathing erotic ditties
down the prima donna’s hack it simply burlesques
all the prettiest points in the opera. Mr.
lirowulow’s voice was in splendid condition —and,
judging by the fine figure he cut in the grey
turn-out, with sulphur-lined cloak, pale blue scarf,
and silver embroideries, it looks as if the same
remark applied to him physically as well. Tapley
Decima Moure’s gentlemanly tenor—reappeared
as Kulino, and Lawn's make-up as the mosquito-
king loosed like a wild burlesque of chorus
methods.
Yours affectionately, Sappho Smith.

Geo. Rignold’s version of “ Faust,” now
running at Her Majesty’s, is partly by Goethe
ami partly by Gilbert .Parker, and the way in
wliich Goethe bears up against Gilbert Parker is
highly commendable. “Faust ”is tolerably old,
but —unless G. Parker interferes with it some
more —it will never become really aged or decrepit.
If Australia ever goes in for a State Church, then
G. Hig-.old ought to be endowed out of its funds,
on condition that lie puts up “Faust ” at regulai
intervals. This drama is a high moral influence,
and about the only thing remaining which makes
men believe in a material hell. It is sternly
suggestive of a laud of darkness and ashes, where
the weeping ghosts of old Scriptural characters,
with snakes in their hair, climb fur ever and ever
up burning mountains arid then slide down again,
and where Balaam and Nimrod, and their mutual
ancestor, the misbegotten ape, and countless
others, sit in rows upon pans of live coals and re-
main there constantly, and shake their blackened
claws at each other in impotent fury. Also the
wailings that are heard at times in the distance
are evidently the cries of loot souls that roam
blindly through the gloom with their flesh
trailing behind them in tatters, and perpetu-
ally s ip anil fall into boiling springs through
treading on the worm that dieth not ; and
the groans of the defunct miser who is
hung up by the means of a hook through his
vitals, just out of reach of a sixpence, whmh he
gratis at vainly for ever afterwards j; and the
shrieks of the person who is enclosed in a burning
room, and perpetually asks the time through «lie
keyhole, and is informed by the demon- 1 that it
isn’t time hut eternity. The last scene consists
mostly of volumes of blinding smoke, arising pre-
sumably from hot coals being shovelled On the
stomachs of the spirits who are pegged out, or else
through the eyeless ghosts stumbling into pits of
hot ashes and creating a smother as they wallow
amid the cinders.

The Bulletin reluctantly tears itself away
from this cheerlul aspect of the case to report on
the show generally. Mr. Riguold makes a con-
vincing Mephistopheles. His Mephisto. is of a
rather rough and aggressive order, but it is played
with profound earnestness and careful attention
to detail. Miss Agnes Knight’s Marguerite is the
best thing this actress has yet done in Sydney.
Miss Kate Bishop is Martha, and consequently
that often rather neglected female is one of
the best features of the show; and Messrs.
Scot Inglis (Fauat), Plimmer (as Valentine),
and Cyril Keightley, who fills the part
of Siebel, are sufficiently good—Mr. Inglis
especially. It is as a spectacle, however,
that “Faust” stands out most conspicuously.
The scenery is piled up on an enormous scale. The
thunder and lightning and the hell-fire and all the
other accompaniments are lavish ; and there is
more bang and crash in it than in any other
version The Bulletin ever saw. Also, it contains
almost every kind of mechanical effect imaginable.
All believers and hysterical females and Sunday-
school teachers and other persons should seize the
present opportunity. The last scene of all, where
a group of angels carries the dead Marguerite to
heaven from the black, sin-stained city, is beauti-
lul, though illogical, and is calculated to appeal
to any hysterical female.

“Paul Jones” and the beloved Insect
commenced the eight weeks’ opera season at Syd-
ney Lyceum atnid a blaze of glory. The audience
was iii a festive humor, and when Nellie Stewart
made her entry in the character of Yvonne she
was kept busy bowing her glossy head for quite
a long time. Concerning the opera, nearly every-
thing has been said in these columns long ago. It
is bright and gaudy and superficial, and altogether
not the kind of work which is likely to last, but
while it does hold out it brings shekels to the
Finn’s treasury quite as well as anything else in
the Lyceum repertoire. The dialogue is amusing,
and the back-cloth is a vision of dazzling splen-
dour, and the music is eminently pleasing to the
G. >th who prefers sweet melody and doesn’t go
into particulars. Also, the characters belong
to that unspecified period when ladies had
short skirts and showed much graceful
ankle, and . when men wore a kind of

Nellie Stewart has not deteriorated in the
least since she first appeared as Yvonne, and the
gallery fell in love with the frisky maid of St.
Malo as one man. Florence Young, however,
doesn’t fill the part of Chopinette as Vi. Varley
used to do, though if the public had never seen
the latter lady it would probably have been quite
content. Also, Howard Vernon’s Don Troeadero
is not so good, by any means, as that of Gourlay.
Possibly the length of the performer has something
to do with this; there is a general feeling that the
bounding Governor should be short and un-
dignified, and Vernon can't look wholly un-
dignified, no matter what he does. Also, this
paper mentions with regret that the Insect has
never been quite the same Insect since Leitch
withdrew himself from the part. Messrs. Wallace
Brownlow, Lauri, Tapley and Lissant, how-
ever, are thoroughly satisfactory, and the
defects don’t amount to much, anyhow. Three
nights of the rather sere and yellow “ Masootte ”
commence on Saturday; followed on Wednesday
by a similar spell of the gorgeous “Gondoliers,”
with the “Mikado” afterwards.

Raymond Blathwayt, the “prince of in-
terviewers,” who filled iu two dreary nights in
Sydney last week, was, without exception, the
most thoroughly solemn lion ever taken under the
wing of Sinythe. A smattering of people attended
the School of Arts on his opening night, and went
away with a surprised expression of countenance.
The lecturer was a long, thin, bald gentleman,
with a johnny’s stick, and his favorite attitude
was an intellectual stoop, like a hen looking into
a bottle of water. The lecture itself was painfully
simple. A series of portraits -—most of them very
beautiful portraits—were thrown on a curtain, and
now and then as one appeared the gifted Blathwayt
would remark, among 1 various other things, that he
—er—stayed with this eminent person for a week
at liis superb—haw—mansion, and they had a
long—haw—discussion on—haw—or something to
that effect. Then he would bang on the floor with
the johnny-stick as a signal to turn on the next
celebrity, and if the next celebrity didn’t come
along fast enough he would throw a few hurried
observations at the operator. He read Kipling’s
very worst poem in a muffled stumble like the
voice of a ghost falling downstairs, and he
also devoted ten minutes to a fearful slab
by Jeromeky Jerome, about a baby. Further,
he remarked that Oliver Cromwell once owned
a racehorse which ran for the Derby pro-
bably in its extreme old age after its owner
was dead. After that the celebrities came
faster and faster. Mr. Blathwayt had-haw
—visited them all, and had apparently held
a most uninteresting conversation with each
of them, and some of them had told him very old
jokes which appeared on the back page of the
Family Herald many long years ago. The oldest
joke of all was told by Max O’Kell, and the
speaker, standing at the extreme corner of the
stage so as not to blot out the picture, told it with
the serious tone of a Scotch elder giving out the
hymn. Then the address came to a sudden end ;
there was a sound like “ haw ” in the far distance
behind the scenes ; and things terminated.

“Jack Sheppard ” is doing its last nights
at Sydney Royal, as per advertisement. The
exact date of its lamented termination is, how-
ever, not yet fixed. At present, in addition to its
intrinsic merits, it is powerfully supported by
Maggie Moore’s new song, “The Sidewalks of
New York.” New York had no sidewalks in
Jack Sheppard’s time, and had hardly begun to
recover from the unkempt and muddy regime of
Peter Stnyvesant and the other Dutchmen ;
but a trifle like this doesn’t matter. No one
expects coherence in a burlesque.

At Sydney Tivoli, a gloom is cast over the
monster programme by the announcement- that
the Sakers are now in their last week. If these
artistes can’t be re-engaged, at immense cost, for
at least one additional night, no one knows what
may happen. The shapely Marie Luella still
remains, which is certainly something, and so
does the bright and tuneful Syria Lament
(what a lovely name!—it seems her name
really is Syria, by tbe way, and not
Lyria), and that child • wonder, little Alma
Grey. But still, the necessity of re-engaging the
Sakers at immense expense, for one night only, is
too obvious to require comment. On Saturday,
Horace Wheatley, “engaged at an enormous
salary,” makes his first appearance, likewise
James Bell, “champion bone soloist,” and Miss
Ada Delroy, alleged to be “ the greatest serpen-
tine dancer in the world.”

Mr. Thomas Walker, ex-M.L. A., has
written a three-act comedy, entitled “Married

day (2.)t.1i), at the Sydney Royal Standard. The
castle scene from “Marmondelle the Moor” is
a 1 so "U the programme, which isn’t giving the
e>m dy a fair show. “ Marmoudelle ” consists
mostly of a seri'-s of long, robust lectures delivered
by the Moor to his faithful friend, who stands
w. arily on alternate legs and listens, and it is
probably tiie heaviest moral effort in the Austra-
lian language.

Big business for the first nights of “ A
Gaiety Girl,” at Melh. Princess's, doesn't neces-
sarily mean that the new brand of entertainment
is certain to boom. Out of every four people who
rush to see “A Gaiety Girl” on its reputation,
one visitor is delighted, another hk> s it much, the
thin] remains open to cu vi-I ion, whilst the fourth
snorts disapproval. The M-llioume jury can't
agree at present, and the truculent minority,
which is mainly composed of Loun- idles, will
probably hold out to the bitter end. But a show
that has so many artistic features is bound to
grow upon tiie majority, “A Gaiety Girl”
improves on acquaintance. The dialogue and
the lyrics disclose many unassuming jokes
and bits of quiet satire, t*'e "''tracbers
are cleverly drawn and group'd, the music
must be heard more than once to be ully a pre-
dated. Indeed, the difference between . airy
work and a burlesque is as wide as the gulf that
separates a Paris bonnet from Liza’s Bank ’Oliduy
’at. The explanatory half of the first act seems to
need pepper—llyley and the French lady’s-maid
might have duetted, for instance —also the story,
from beginning to end, is a fast “ sassiety ” story,
with very little human interest for the working
man and his wife. “ A Gaiety Girl ” appeals to
the gallery as an elegant musical spectacle, simply
that and nothing more. However, there isn’t a
gallery at the Princess’s.
« # *
Last week’s favorable report upon the
company will bear the strictest investigation. The
company’s principals are good, and some minor
lights, who have little to do and less to speak,
make their marks in a tuneful controversy between
Gaiety girls and society damsels. Three valuable
artists, not previously mentioned, are Leedham
Ban tuck, Mrs. Edmund Phelps and Fritz Rimma.
Mr. Bantock, who plays the giddy Divorce-court
Judge, is practically the same comedian as Can-
nam, formerly with B. and B. Mrs, Phelps (Miss
Hudspeth iu former days) represents the estimable
cook who married the Judge, and Fritz
Rimma is chiefly famous for bearing Miss
Maud Hobson m Ids arms to and from a
bathing-machine. Miss Hobson has no visible
reason engaging this vehicle just out-
side a fashionable hotel, but being there she
sends the audience frantic by practising her arts
upon two elderly admirers. Sometimes she leans
out of the wooden box and hugs Moukhou.se round
the neck, which must be heavenly for Mr. M.,
anyway, after which she closes the little doors
with a bang, and orders the had man to tear him-
self away. Finally, the peerless creature makes
up her mind to marry an indescribable majah
(Fred Kaye), who has been a popular actor until
then. Naturally, he is an object of general haired
at the finish.
* *
Miss Decima Moore, too, creates a certain
prejudice against Mr. Louis Bradfield hy going
behind the bathing-machine to kiss him ; likewise
Ryley would greatly oblige by keeping Miss
Massey away from his shirt-front. Stage love-
making vvitli divinities such as these amounts to
cruelty. The johnnies in the reserved stalls can’t
stand much more of it. If somebody starts to
hug Miss Palotta they will roll off their seats and
die. The Franco-German accent and the romping
style of Miss Palotta make her a prime favorite ;
nevertheless, she might play the character of a
jealous, vindictive little cat. with stronger effect.

“The Span of Life” is a huge, imposing
triumph at Melb. Royal, Nothing of equal mast-
nitude has happened in the venerable establish-
ment since the interior was re gilded, even if it
happened before then. The villain Dunstan is to
ordinary monsters what the' sun is to the moon,
and his mother does him credit. No hero within
the present writer’s recollection has come back
from the dead so cheerfully, or so often, as gallant
Walter Baker. Among heroines, Miss Spong
stands alone. Dunstan captures her in Zambesia,
and drags her through a wilderness of prickly
pears and cactuses at the end of a rope ; he kicks
her little boy, and fires a second lot of bullets into
her husband, yet the fourth act finds Miss
Spong living iu the same house with Dunstan,
who makes her an offer of marriage. Miss Spong
must be the New Woman. “The Span of Life”
.is an unusually lively melodrama, and Bland Holt
seems to have much to do with its popularity,
apart from the fact that he brought the scenery
over from Sydney. Mrs. Bhind Holt and the
child who sneaks the poisoned grapes may also
claim credit for helping to crowd the auditorium.
And since the living bridge is an unparalleled
attraction, the Arabs are herewith warmly com-

example the middle acrobat would buck, and send
the Mohammedans flying down the chasm,

The Bijou closed its doors on Monday
night, and for the pres. ait that deserving theatre
is “resting.” The D.cre season was born un-
lucky. A naughty play was produced, yet
nobody talked about it. Miss Roselle proved
herself the finest actress, always excepting Divine
Sarah, that Melbourne has had a chance to listen
to these many years, hut she made no headway
against the tide of adversity. When Miss Roselle
ami her husband decided to bring a pair of inex-
perienced actresses to support them in Australia
they made a grave mistake, which might have
been partially remedied later on. The remedy
was not applied and the season “snuffed out” as
aforesaid.

“Don Juan, Junior,” at the Cambridge, is
rather less sad than it seemed on the opening
night, but is quite hopeless, anyway. Miss Eva
Clements and D’Arcy Stanfield, who were bright
and amusing in farcical comedy, waste their
energy upon “Don Juan.” The Opera House
variety show will be strengthened by the arrival
of the Sakers and ventriloquist Winton next

heard everywhere. Paling’s have abendy cleared
the first hig edition, and have got out two others

football-song ever written, and the press every-
where has risen to describe it as the best comic
song of the day, and funnier than “Killaloe” or
“ B dlyhooley. ’’ It is just the thing lor an aspir-

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of .this imperfection; and now, after
long years of careful and di'igent research, art has
ti iumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory mav lie had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

Queensland, which has about .£3,000,000, mostly
borrowed money, in the Q. N. Bank, anil won't lake any
of it out, lately authorised a new loan to repay about
£1.900,000 of old loan falling due next January. The
Queensland loan is at 3.J ret cent, and is to he issued at
97). The money could almost certainly he obtained with
ease at pir in either Sidney or Melbourne, and a
large amount he thus saved in commission and expenses,
Queensland’s last loan, floated in London in 1893. realised
a miserable £BB I6s. 4d. for every £lOO debenture, and the
expenses reached the awful total of £3 per cent., so that
the wretched Fat Man Government only got £B5 15s. for
every £lOO of liability, and the alleged 34 percent, inter, st
really amounted to over 4j. It. couldn’t have done worse
than this in Australia, and it could hardly have avoided
doing much better. The pertinacity with which the Nel-
son Government sticks to the London market after this
experience is pathetic, or maudlin, or something else,

At the annual meeting of the Mutual Life
Assn, of Ans. it tianspired that the properties acquired by
foreclosure are yielding 6 per cent, interest on their
nominal value of 163,680. Tnis is either remarkably good
lin kor remarkably good management. Q nerally a fore-
closure im-ans that the property has fallen in value
below the amount lent, and it is cheaper to let it slide
than pav interest on the mortgage. If the foreclosed
properties represent, as they usually do, the worst invest-
ments, the Association lias every right to feel good.
The invested funds of the Associ'tion are now yielding
(erroneously printed as 5} in a previous issue) per cent.

the owners should lose a mine they gave 1 20,000 for and
on which they spoil another £20.000 in machinery be-
cause of the accidental omission to pay £5 rent to the
Govt. If the State thus f- •ft its a mine, it (the State)
should get the mine—not any third party.

The Bulletin hoars that the Murchison claim,
Leviathan, No. I South, is really a lease registered at the
warden’s office as “George Higinhotham," but the Tory
Horn crowd couldn’t swallow such a name. Perhaps,
however, the shade of the great little Democrat will yet
have excellent, reason to rejoice over the change. If the
original owner is to he believed, the Leviathan is by no
means as good as (say) Mount Morgan.
From all one can hear, the great majority of the

The articles most imitated are

WHY ?
BECAUSE they have the beat reputation and

11 is really wonderful that the Australian people
ait- so slow to see the truth us regards the unscru-
pulous quacks and charlatans who prey on the
credulity of the Australian public. Scarcely a
week ever passes but what the press exposes the
barefaced and shameful practices of some of these
harpies, yet, in face of all, they seem to thrive, and
the paper which hounds them down most thrives
fattest on their advertisements and cracks cham-
pagne over each balance-sheet. Clements Tonic
and Fletcher’s Pills have never yet stooped to
deception and misrepresentation. They are scien-
tific therapeutical agents, and evidence as to their
value can be found in every district, and, such
being the ease, it is unnecessary to further extol
their virtues.

Some of the recent professional Court

According to W. P. Crick, lawyer and
legislator, Salomons, Q.C., father of the N.S.W.
Bar, is the only Sydney barrister now earning
£4OOO a year. Crick further avers that, excepting
Mr. Dailey (now Chief Justice), no N S. Wales
Judge was in receipt of the amount of his
present salary when at the Bar. Certainly Mr.
Darley was the only one who at. first refused the
office; the others simply scrambled for the ermine
and millinerj'—and, above all, for the prospect of
the pension of £lBOO a year. Premier Reid
alleges that Mr. Parley’s Bar income was £BOOO
to £9OOO per annum.
Alec. Ohamley, who may fairly claim to be
n, champion amateur oar.-uuan of Australia, is a
native of Longford (Tas.), and, though he fiist
rowed in the club of his native town, all his per-
formances have been put up since his advent in
Vic. Mr. Chamley is a notable example of
dogged perseverance; he rowed for five years before
he managed to score his first win at Colac with
the Albert Park Club in ’B3. The ice once broken,
however, he went away with a rush ; and
when he severed his connection with the
Albert Park in ’9O he had scored 30 wins,
including one champion eight, the last 17 being
unbroken by a single defeat. He then joined the
Yarra Yarra club, and his success continued. He
rowed No. 7 in the famous champion eight of
that club, and No. 3 in its champion four, to
Ainley’s stroke in each instance. Up to date,
Chamley’s wins total 58, of which 7 are champion
races and 5 interprovincial contests. This record
is not nearly approached by any other man in his
province. In the stroke seat he has only once been
tried in an important race, and on that occasion
he was scarcely up to promise, so returned the
next time to his old position. Chamley is a splen-
didly-built man, combining form and strength,
and steps into the boat at a weight varying from
list. 81bs, to 12st.

until ’B3 that he began to keep a
record of his performances.
Since that year he has finished

enormous chest and arm-develop-

Heath being regarded by the
Argus and the Tory faction in
Melbourne as a suspicious power
behind the throne. The suspicion
is quite unfounded ; and the con-

use his kick to more advantage,
or to give his opponent the wash

The eldest son of Somers Vine, a rather

N.S.W. police force is not yet to lose the

Moreton Frewen is at once aristocrat and
democrat. He was born in Sussex rather worse
than 40 years ago. His father, the late Thomas
Frewen, was member of the House of Commons,
and was as vehement a Protectionist and anti-
Peelito as his son is a “ Silverite.” The fortunes
of the family “ throw back ” to Accepted Frewen,
the merry tutor of Charles 11. Accepted got the
fab See of York and invested his savings (silver
money, of course) in what is now the family estate.
Moreton Frewen graduated from Trinily College,
Cambridge, in ’75. He was for some seasons
Master of the University Draghounds, and presi-
dent of that coterie of wine and wassail, the
Athenaeum Club. After graduating, he went
into headquarters at Melton Mowbray, where hu
was associated with George Wliyte Melville, and
other noted sportsmen. One day Moreton Frewen
rode (on Emperor) two matches at Meltoii steeple-
chases against the horses of future N.S. Wales
Governors. The first lie won from Lord Car-
rington’s Banshee—which was ridden by Arthur
Coventry, a crack amateur. The other race he
lost to Robert Duff’s Roscommon Captain
“Doggy” Smith being in the saddle. The
Fee wen colors are “cherry jacket and white
cross belts,” and were once well known. One of
the brothers owned that phenomenal horse
Cavaliero—brother to Musket —which won nearly
30 races, in all sorts of company and over all dis-
tances. Since the racing phase of his life, More-
ton Frewen has spent many summers on the
Big Horn Mountains and many winteisih the Far
East, and has now an extraordinarily large list
of acquaintances. He counts most of the poli-

ticians on both sides of the Atlantic as his per-
sonal friends. He is now entered for all it is worth
in the silver campaign, and brings to it a wealth
of enthusiasm, and accurate knowledge of detail
acquired by actual observation. Until the silver
question is settled, or settles itself, Moreton
Frewen will traverse the world on his mission.
He is a J.P. for County Galway, and holds a com-
mission in the Leicestershire Yeomanry Cavaliy,
but these and his beloved hunting-grounds will
know him no more. Whatever may be the truth,
Moreton Frewen is earnestly of the opinion that
the white man is doomed by the present condition
,of currency to be “done” by the yellow races.
Up to date he has held no silver interest what-
ever—and the charge that he is an emissary
of silverado princes he declares to be laughable.
He is a man of independent means who has chosen
to hunt gold-monometallism in place of hunting on
the Big Horn Mountains, On behalf of a syndicate
he has recently made a conditional offer of
,£150,000 for the Centra] Broken Hill mine. 'Phe
offer has set tongues wagging on every Stock Ex-
change in Australia, but it has for a moment
silenced certain venomous press critics. Moreton
Frewen has been talking for a rise—therefore,
said the critics, he is an interested party trying
to bull silver stocks—he wants to sell. When he
made his big offer to buy, the critics collapsed.
Moreton Frewen figures in Stead’s “Splendid
Paupers” as Rawton Silvertongue, and it is on a
conversation with Frewen that Stead built the
book. Moreton Frevven is tall and muscular, is a
brilliant conversationalist, and looks 10 years
younger than he is. He is a Protectioni.-t and a
Radical.
Card. Vaughan lately reminded the Card.
Archbishop of Toledo (Spain) that the “conver-

prophecy. Most people can only discern Angli-
can Disestablishment and State Secularism as the
coining twins.

During the last 40 years the Vic. Treasury
has spent £11,000,009 in subsidies to Local Govern-
ment bodies. From 1853 or 1862 the local bodies
raised £103,000 in local taxation and got £530,000
from the Treasury. From ’62 to ’72 they raised a
million in local taxation and got two millions in
endowments. Then the endowment made a fresh
start, just when the local bodies were getting
rich enough to do without it, and in the next 20
years £8,000,000 was “ blewed ” in grants. The
advantages of Local Government, when the muni-
cipalities get most of their revenue by wailing on
the door-mat of the Colonial Treasurer, don’t
amount to much. The subsidy disease wants to
be killed dead.
By what precedent of timidity does it
happen that the N.S.W. Executive cannot release
a prisoner whom it wishes to release, and whom
it has solemnly vowed to release, because the try-
ing Judge’s report is adverse to that release ! Is
the Judge a responsible member of the commuting
tribunal ? Is there any law that binds down the
Executive only to perform acts of clemency by
permission of the Judge. If not, how is it that
the Executive seems unable to move without the
approving smile of the Judge? _ N.S. Wales is in
hard case. Trial by jury promises to become trial
by Judge. Commutation of sentence by Execu-
tive seems to already be commutation only by
Judge’s consent. Is the Judge also a juror and a
gaoler? If so, why not make him likewise flagel-
lator and executioner ?

The Reid (N.S.W.) Government has

River to make it available for navigation. The
estimated cost of the work is £2,500,000, and
unless this amount is spent the present £19,000
will be absolutely wasted. Therefore, the Govern-
ment might just as well call for tenders for the
supply of one brick as an instalment of a new

the bench that he holds 21 different billets in addi-
tion to that of constable. And the salary for the
whole 21 is just £lO a year—about 4s. a week—
less than every seven days for each billet.
A Maoriland paper casts some new light
on the “ Disappearing Australian Seaman.” The
loss of life through overloading, under-manning,
coffin-ships, accidents, bad food, &e., is so great
that sailors die eight times faster than miners,
nine times faster than railway employes, and 151
times faster than factory - operatives. Which
about boils down to the awful fact that if the
average factory operative dies aged 150 years, the
average sailor dies at the age of 12 months. No
wonder the seaman disappears.
“ The men who are most eager to be paid
for being in Parliament are the very men most of
us would very much sooner pay to keep out of it,”
shrieks an indignant English literary person.
“ Us ” means himself and all other members of
the snobocracy, plutocracy, and aristocracy. They
would willingly contribute to a fund for the main-
tenance of class legislation, no doubt. The history
of Britain, and of every other country, is the his-
tory of popular opinion slowly and surely working
reforms in the face of a Tory “ us,” who would
have paid everybody to keep out of it.
The German G.ovb. has a State accident-
fund to which both employer and employed con-
tribute. Tlie system lias proved a success, and
might be adopted here, as it prevents employers
inducing the men to make contracts relieving them
of liability. It would also tend to prevent the ex-
istence of rotten companies apparently run for the
benefit of the manager only.

"PAWS!"
PARSON : “ Pause, brother, pause- .”
BILL : “ By gob, yes; they are beauties .”
The people of Australia don’t want secret
careful trials by Executive. They want careful
public tiials by the Supreme Court. Any man,
however eminent, who brings the Supreme Court
into disrepute by tampering either with the letter
or the spirit of the law, is an enemy of justice, and
should bo treated accordingly.
The plausible Premier Reid: “It would
have been the refinement of cruelty to delay the
decision of the Executive in the case of Dean.”
Yet the same Reid Cabinet lately kept the con-
demned Frenchman, Grenon (since hanged), in
suspense for six weeks without any shadow of
justification whatever, and even without publicly
offering any excuse for the delay.
Hourigau, Labor - member for West
Torrens, is the only avowed Single-taxer m S.A.
Parliament.
The gang-in-office has its thumb
on the carotid artery of three-fourths
of the Westralian press, and most of
the other fointh has succumbed to the
blandishments of “Govt, advts.” All
told, the “six-family dynasty” has
contracted for a long term of ascend-
ancy.
Crown colony convict-time rule
has so broken the, spirit of Westralians
that they still think they are slaves
who are requir' d to do the bidding of
their master. Hence the meek tolera-
tion of f • v Forrest's autocratic ad-
ministration.
A FACT. —“ THE HEW WOMAN.”
Scene in George street, Sydney.
A Bulletin correspondent ; —“Vic. civil-
servants are again attempting to form a united
association. A meeting was lately held at which
demi god Bride took the chair. Dr. Bride is far
and away the most popular man in the civil-service
over since he led the band which opposed Wollas-
ton’s proposition to voluntarily give up half incre-
ments. But the meeting did not allude to the two
secret societies already in existence in the service.
One of these, the ‘ Pope’s Own,’ is restricted
entirely to R.O. civil-servants, and almost every
Irishman in the service is a member; while the
other, the ‘Queen’s Own,’ is a branch of the
Orange order, and only Protestants are eligible.
The latter has a members’ roll of about a thou-
sand. Every precaution is taken by each society
to keep its business entirely secret, and so care-
fully is the matter guarded that many a man with
no leanings towards one body or the other has
been in the service for years without suspecting
that any such clubs are in existence. The mem-
bers of each body, however they may fight among
themselves, are sworn to unite against outsiders.
Consequently the service consists of two solid
bodies continually pushing against each other,
while the few stragglers beyond the pale of
both look on and wonder what it all means. ’’
Govt, expenditure on S.A. village
ments is limited by Act to £5O per settler.
Already £47 per male settler has been spent, and
matters are nearing a crisis. Minister Gillen now
raises the point whether women are “settlers”
within the meaning of the Act. If not, some of
the villages must soon be wound up.
Ninian Melville, ex-N.S. W. M.P., is
assiduously cultivating the suffrages of the Sydney
suburb of Ash field. A few months ago he was
nobody locally ; then he became alderman ; now he
is mayor, and bullies the council furiously when it
objects to him playing fast-and-loose with lamp-
posts. Ashfield is Ninny’s “ dead-bird ” : the elec-
tors may as well get into the hearse and go quietly.
D. H. Dairy m pie, the Mackay ex-
chemist, lately made Q, Minister for Educa-
tion, is a man of considerable brains and
considerably more bile. It is an open
question whether Toryism has made
him bilious, or bile has made him Tory,
or whether bile and Tory principles are
merely effects of the same grand liver-
cause ; but for sound dyspepsia and
solid Conservatism combined Dalrym-
ple can give points to any other
Cabineteer in Australasia. Like
Cassius, he reads much, he is a
great observer, and he looks quite
through the deeds of men—and
withal fails utterly to compre-
hend them, being thoroughly
one-sided and unsympathetic.
He is also sickbed-o’er with the
pale cast of thought, or with the
reflection of the large-
green bottles behind
which he used to
pestle his poisons ;
and he is respected
by the Labor-party
as an able and
honestly-mistaken
adversary.
That pleasant
official patron
of municipal
sweating, the
Mayor of Mel-
bourne, has been
giving advice to
Works-Minister Taver-
ner on the subject of relief-
works for the unemployed.
Taverner must wait till June before
he even mentions the subject. Taverner’s
talk in March will only encourage pauperism.
Taverner is only encouraging the “ undeserving
cases.” Bumble Melbourne demands that poverty
shall be discouraged. Bumble Melbourne is the
author of the celebrated poem—
4s. lid. a day
For man, horse and dray.
Bumble Melbourne is going to put down wagi s
and poverty—if the community does not rise up in
the meantime and put down Bumble Melbourne.
Westralia’s revenue has at length reached
<£1,000,000. Last quarter’s returns exceeded those
for the same period of 1894 by <£156,267 or-
-87 per cent. Customs increased <£58,609, or 79
per cent.; railways, £56,548, or 234 per cent.
Will some member of N.S.W. Assembly
move for a full return of all floggings inflicted
during the last four years, in gaols of the province,
fur alleged breaches of discipline; such return to
give, in each case, the name of the justice or jus
tices by whom the torture was ordered?
The Yic. Government has just granted
a civil servant twelve months’ leave, with
six months’ pay and six months’ half-pay.
So far as appears to the public, this
particular officer gets ,£5OO a year for
breaking open envelopes and distri-
buting correspondence; and Premier
Turner, when asked how a rigidly-
retrenching, badly-broken Govern-
ment could afford to do this thing,
enthusiastically pointed out that
he had made rather a smart move,
since, by granting the leave, he
saved the country £125. Obvi-
ously it is better to pay a man
<£375 to go and have a twelve
months’ picnic than to give him
.£5OO to hang round a department
for a year. Turner has now no
alternative but to give the whole
Civil Service twelve months' leave
on three-quarter pay for the sake of
retrenchment.
The charter of the British
South Africa Co. the joyous
butchers of Matabeleland com-
mands all Judges in British “ colo-
nies and possessions " to construe
the law “in the most favorable
sense ” in cases where the Co. is
concerned, and orders all “colonial”
governors, commanders and officials
generally to “ aid and abet 1 " the
Co. when called upon. Legal advice
has lately been taken on this docu-
ment, and the opinion given is that
any British Governor can be called
upon to help the Co. with the mili-
tary forces of his particular “colony"
if it wants such assistance. The pos-
sible spectacle of the Matabelelsnd
brigands demanding that Acting-Gov.
Darley shall send over the N.S.W,
Permanent Artillery to lend them a hand is
picturesque, anyhow,

Society
like an exact report of the evidence (the daily-
newspaper accounts are utterly incomplete, and,
in some respects, misleading) have no means of
effectively criticising the scientific evidence.
Arsenic is a strong irritant; strychnine kills by
producing tonic muscular contractions. The muscles
of the heart are contracted, and the heart is
stopped. Palmer, who was, of course, an expert
poisoner, used to reduce his victims with small
doses of arsenic, and, when their systems were
completely lowered, finish them off with com-
paratively small doses of strychnine, which they
were then quite unable to withstand.
» # #
lb is a grave public misfortune that the
only official record of the evidence in the Dean
ease is the Judge’s notes, the accuracy of which
was, in regard to one matter of grave importance
to accused, challenged at the trial by prisoner’s
advocate. This led to the recall of awi tness, and,
as her evidence bore out counsel’s objection, his
Honor amended his notes accordingly. In all
capital cases there should be an official verbatim
report both of evidence and argument. The Judge
can’t reasonably be expected to take a verbatim
note.
» # •
Says the S. M. Herald ; “ During the
time the woman (Mrs. Dean) was suffering from
poison, the prisoner (Dean) was the only person in
the house.” Evidently the fact that Mrs. Dean
was also in the house has never occurred to the
Herald.
• * •
The difficulty of tracing the purchase of
the arsenic used in the North Shore poisoning case
is possibly due to its having been sold by an
unlicensed chemist or assistant, or to some chemist
having supplied it without making the statutory
entry in his poison-book. The penalty in either
case being heavy, the vendor would, no doubt, be
silent. Under the circumstances, the Attorney-
General might well consider the advisability of
notifying in the Government Gazette that no
prosecution under the Poisons Act would follow
on information b ing given by any chemist who
had transgressed the law.
# * •
A good chai'acter seems to be the most
damning attribute which can be possessed by
an accused prisoner in N.S. Wales. “Prisoner
bears a good character,” said counsel for the pro-
secution, “but good men often go wrong. And,
later on, the (Dean) jury was told that, although
prisoner had undoubtedly been a blameless man
and a brave man, too, yet it had been noticed
again and again that men physically brave, or
brave upon sudden impulse, are very apt to com-
mit cowardly murders. Good men, though, as a
matter of fact, less likely to commit crimes than
other men, do sometimes go wrong. But the
truism, which might well have been let alone, was
dwelt upon with such iteration, and was stated in
so one-sided a way that what the jury practically
learned was the lie that good men must inevitably
commit crimes at last, and brave men are
especially given to the commission of cowardly
murders. On the other baud, the jury was
practically incited to dismiss instantly from its
mind all recollection of the bad character and
bad record of Mrs. Dean’s mother. In the future
it will really be necessary for defending counsel to
beg the jury not to allow prisoner’s good character
to weigh against him.
# # •
Sir Thomas Buxton, the New Governor of
South Australia, will really be, it is increasingly
plain, a pretty hard person to enthuse over. He
doesn’t come of an ancient and noble family, but
of a brewery. Hardly anybody in Australia ever
heard of him before. His chief recommendation
seems to be that he is the cousin of Sydney Bux-
ton, and hardly anybody ever heard of bun either.
His name has a common, plebeian. Billjones sort
of sound, and be is a pious, elderly i>hilanthropis fc
who has a horror of betting. The Buxton title 13
comparatively new. Also, the new Governor g
Dean’s “ unfortunate manner ” was one
of the things which told against him at his repent
trial. He looked anxious, depressed, and at times
even fearful. The average juryman, who has seen
the noble bearing of George Kignold, and VV. E.
]3aker, and A.fred Dam pier, when falsely accused
in the second act, always regards this sort of
thing as an evidence of guilt. It is true that the
same juryman would probably look like an un-
hanged assassin it he was suddenly put up to be
photographed, or to make a speech at a tea-meet-
ing, or if he attempted to propose to his best girl
for the first time, or if he asked his bad-tempered
boss for a rise of salary, or if he found himself on
the Lyceum stage with a whole audience looking
at him ; but when another man is in the dock
with everybody looking at him, and talking about
him, and with a knowledge that he will probably
be hanged into the bargain, he must be perfectly
calm. If he isn’t, then there is strong reason to
believe him guilty.
The most hopelessly guilty-looking man Thb
Bulletin ever saw —one whose aspect would have
led any jury to convict him on the spot —was good,
manly, honest old bill Beach, ex-champion sculler,
the night he was presented with a gold watch at
tiie Gaiety Theatre. Another man whose guilty
countenance ran Beach very close, and who looked
scared and embarrassed and uttterly bowled-out
as well, was the kindly Judge Miller, of Queens-
land. When the writer saw him he was trying to
explain to a Rockhampton jury the law relating to
a case about some injury done to a fence. Judge
Miller was a confused speaker, and he always wore
a miserable, found out expression when he tried
to snm-up the evidence. And, next to these two,
the man of all others within the present scribe's
experience, who looked as if he deserved 20 years
hard labor, was a perfectly harmless youth who
attempted to recite a poem at a church social and
couldn’t remember the eighteenth verse. The
good old criminal court theory that an innocent
man always looks calm and dignified is unutter-
able bosh. Only one man in ten caij go into a
draper’s simp and buy a pair of lady s stockings
without looking as if he had recently murdered
his wife and eleven children.
Said Dailey on a memorable occasion : —“ Once
accuse a man of a crime and people will be ready
to believe him guilty. Place the most honest and
pleasing face behind the rails of this dock, and it
at once becomes a face that expresses every evil
passion.” #
The request of the committee appointed
to investigate the Dean case that the aid
of D.tective Goulder, “whom they believe to
be the best officer in the service” on account of
his sagacity, &c., in connection with the Barraba
case, be placed at tbeir disposal, is not likely to
promote good feeling at the detective-office, and
for that very reason is not calculated to help the
cause of D an. If the Govt, is wise, it will refer
the matter to the veteran detective chief. Superin-
tendent Camphin, and let him make his own ar-
rangements.

Chinese puzzle. Why did J udge Windeyer
endorse the Dean jury’s recommendation to mercy ?
Has Mr. Windeyer committed his reasons to
writing? and will the N.S.W. Govt, enlighten the
public by publishing those reasons ? Suppose you
were in Mr. Windeyer’s place, what reasons could
you assign for joining in the recommendation
after your expressions of opinion concerning the
absolute certainty of accused’s guilt and the cold-
blooded enormity of the crimes of which he had
been convicted ? Answers to this will be received
at The Bulletin office up to Ist Jan., 17,041.
• * *
Dr. Novvmarch, who attended Mrs. Dean
during her illness, states that the symptoms, in
his opinion, were those of ptomaine poisoning
(such as arises through eating unwholesome or
partially-decayed food), which are much the same
as those of arsenical (wisoning. “Such cases are
not uncommon . . ■ and at this time several
cases of a similar nature came under my notice
among my patients.’ 1 These “ several other
cases ” are noteworthy. Did George Doan poison
these other cases, too? And if these ‘‘other
cases” had sent for the police, would their hus-
bands or wives, as the case may be, be now doing
penal servitude for life? Also, is there any real
evidence that they were not all (Mrs. Deans
included) cases of ptomaine-poisoning ?
• * •
Premier Reid (in the Dean case), alluding
to Sergeant Sawtell’s report : “ Any police officer
who sent in such reports was not worthy of much
consideration.” And yet Sawtell, a man of good
repute and long in the service, must be a
reliable officer, for was he not the man en-
trusted with the case of Archer, hanged for the
murder of the poor Burton-st. dressmaker ?
# • #
Why should a Judge’s report to the Execu-
tive on the case of a prisoner whose sentence is
under consideration, be regarded as confi-
dential ” and inviolably secret ? Ihe prisoner was
tried publicly, the Judge summed up publicly an
sentenced the convict publicly, hind a logical
reason if you can, why his Honor s subsequent
report should be “ private and confidential.
# • *
Whence did Mr. Want, Q.C., prosecuting in
the Dean case, derive his misinformation that
strychnine acts as an antidote to arsenic . Dr.
Newmarch, the only medical witness, specifically
denies being responsible for the theory ; and the
medical profession, in the absence of anything
wife is i: partially invalided,” so that it will be
impossible for the gushing local female to be very
much of a sister to her ; and Government House
is likely to be a place of gloom. Buxton seems to
be coming out as an act of retribution on the pro-
vince which wanted to dispense with British
Governors altogether, and as a special insult to b.
Way C.J., and his Pomeranian “ dorg.
# • •
Now -Chum : “ Excuse me. Popular
opinion here favors Brassey as Governor. He is
certainly hospitable, and all that. But he is the
greatest bore in the British Umpire. I have dined
with him, but would prefer dining with an under-
taker. If there is one thing capable of damming
the flood-tide of Australian Federation it is
Brassey’s advocacy. Brassey’s enthusiasm is a
killing frost, and if Turner really wants Federa-
tion he had better keep Brassey off the subject.’

Out of seven new “Hundreds ” lately pro-
claimed in S. A., five are named after second-rate
politicians, and only two bear native names, the
whole of S. A. is dotted with townships, counties,
and hundreds named after extinct (some of them
not exstinkt) politicians. Apropos, Gov. Jervois
named all towns proclaimed during his term alter
friends and relatives, and Petersburg and Game-
ton will for ever respectively immortalise Ins son
and daughter. As an illustration of local senti-
ment in this matter, when Lord Kmtore re-named
Inuamineka, on the S.A, border, Hopetoun
after the Vic. Governor, the press and public
ignored the alteration, and the town remains
“ Innatn ncka ” to this day.

a smooth -faced, gentle-mannered barrister,
a dozen or so years ago a clergyman, appeared as
counsel for petitioner in an Australian divorce-ease
lately, the parties to which he had married in hia
ecclesiastical epoch. He admitted to a friend sub-
sequently that the acceptance of the second fee
affected him strangely, but that he in pait quieted
the perturbation by putting the money in a dif-
ferent pocket.

In reference to matrimonial-office advts.
which state that a clergyman is on hand to tie
nuptial knots, Sydney Presbyterian Synod, after
careful investigation, is in a position to say that no
eh rgyman of the N.S. W. Presbyterian church
works in connection with such advertisers. Will
other churches follow ?
The Australasian
Medical Gazette pub-
lishes a violent screech
about the unprofessional
conduct of the advertising
doctor. Advertising is con-
trary to professional eti-
quette, and professional
etiquette was invented by
old doctors who had be-
come known and were do-
ii:<jr a good business, to
prevent you n g doctors
becoming known and
taking ihe business from
them. According to medi-
cal etiquette, the right
thing for the new M.D.
to do is to put on his
door a small brass plat
which doesn t attract an
pu> .lie attention, and then
conceal himself as much
as possible for fear he
should get patients. If he
gets a patient in spite of
his concealment, then he
may write an account of
the horrible state of that
person’s inside, and send it
to the Medical Gazette,
and g* t an advt. in that
fashion, but the patient
must have come to him I y
accident. He isn’t even
allowed to have his nan e
on his late customer’s torn I -
stone; the inscription
simply says that John
Smith is dead, but tic
name of the physician who
killed him is carefully sup-
pressed. Medical eti-
quette is a great institu-
tion.
There is no deceptive frill about “Pansy,
the New Maori Woman, of pure descent, whose
portrait appears in this week’s Bulletin.
“Pansy ” believes that no lady should be ashamed
to acknowledge her legs ; and her dashing cyclis
costumes are the admiration of Napier, where she
•‘does the block ” regularly. A native of Hawke-
Bay, and recently married (as shown by the tattu -
marks on her chin), “Pansy” is a first-chi,s-
cyolist, with considerably more pace than most of
the large retinue of Maori hercyclists who aiv
privileged to accompany her. She is_ also a Km-
horsewoman ; can kick a football with credit;
speaks English well; and her manners an-
charming.

The recent Yarra accident, where the
river fell into a tunnel and the workmen wen-
drowned like rats in a cage, came about in tie-
usual way. An “air-lock” was provided as a
place of refuge in case of accident, a cave-in being
regarded as extremely probable. But apparently
the inner door of the alleged place of refute
wouldn’t open, and thus the air-chamber, with Us
impervious door, cut off retreat. If the alleged
valuable precaution hadn’t been taken the en-
tombed laborers would at least have had a chance
to run for their lives; as it was they had none.
The air-chamber, according to the reports, was
only in this fatal condition for a few minutes.
The collapse took place inside these few minutes.
It always does.

Mrs. D. M'Loake, Wakefield, N.Z., who writes
on May 19th. 1893 : —lt gives me. the greatest of
pleasure to testify to the good effects of your won-
derful Clements Tonic. My complaint was indi-
gestion accompanied by heartburn and windy
spasms, which were very painful, leaving me very
weak, unfitting me for attending to my household
duties. I got one of your pamphlets from our
storekeeper ; read its contents, and of people who
have been cured by taking Clements Tonic; hope
sprang up in my breast and I determined to give
it a trial. I got some of it and its effects has
proved really wonderful ; I also give it to my chil-
dren when anything is the matter with them, in
fact I keep it as a family medicine. When any of
our children complain I at once consult your book,
which just states their case ; two or three doses
puts them all right. I recommend it to all my
friends. —I remain, yours truly, D. M'Loake,
Wakefield, N.Z.

A charitable undertaker volunteered to
bury the victims of the Melbourne sewer disaster
gratis. Contractor Robb, unfortunately, had
made other funeral arrangements before this offer
came Co hand, therefore he suggested that the
undertaker in question might like to donate the
approximate cost of six interments to the fund
now being raised for the dead men’s families,
rtie coffin Samaritan replied that money was tight
with the firm, but since he had offered to bury six
bodies free of charge he was “willing to do the
same number of other funerals and let the proceeds
go to the benefit of the fund.” An exceptional
opportunity for half-a-dozen charitably-disposed
persi m to die in a good cause.

The Melbourne streets are now mostly-
lighted with electricity supplied by the Corpora-
tion, and Melbourne City Council proposes next
to furnish the electric-light to shops, warehouses,
offices, and private residences. Meanwhile, the
slow-going people of Sydney are still boggling over
their scheme for giving away the whole electric-
lighting privileges of their city to a syndicate.
There is no serious attempt at .any municipal
enterprise in the matter. Even in the worst times
of depression the Victorian “lays over ” all other
Australians in the matter of enterprise.
# # *
One effect of the introduction of the elec-
tric-light is the lowering of the average age of
barmaids in city hotels. The elderly “girl,” who
could make up for 23 under gas, and who, with
her experience, could reduce more Johnnies to a
cash-shedding condition in an evening tiian the
younger Hebe could in a week, is fast disappearing
from the remorseless glare of the pitiless exposer
of crows’ feet and wrinkles.

Judicial logic. Judge Harding (Q ) to a
prisoner found guilty of incest ; “ I find your age
is 45 years. Taking the ordinary span of life, you
have 25 years of life before you. I will give you
half of those 25 years in penal servitude. The
sentence of the court is 12 years’ penal servitude.
If you had been a younger man I should have
used the same rule.” Superb ! The amount of
sentence depends not upon the crime committed,
then, but upon the age of the criminal. Also,
crime is infinitely worse in a young and budding
sinner than in a hardened old reprobate, and should
be punished accordingly. A Daniel to the Judg-
ment !

A Tasmanian poet has just published a
book containing a few little things which he has
dashed off. One of them, which seems to have
been dashed rather more violently than the rest,
c mceriis the “Wreck of the Wairarapa.” Two
verses are as follows :
This poem ought to be framed and hung up on
the bridge oi every steamboat where th* captain
could always stri it. No captain would take any
risks when he knew that poems like that would
be written about him after his death.

Melbourne’s latest is a craze for having
“society” infants photo’d in the nude. Every
photographer’s show-case contains a few pictures
of babies with the least possible clothing on.
One youngster, conspicuously shown (a girl), is
absolutely naked wears nothing but a most
ribald smirk. Fancy that girl aged say 20, turn-
ing over tl e leaves of a strange album and sud-
denly striking on the interesting representation
of childish innocence, her “best boy” gazing
admiringly over her shoulder meanwhile. There
are great possibilities ahead for infantile photo-
graphy in the nude.

Divided skirts and divided hearts are
coupled in the case of a well-known citizen and
his wife. She wears knickers and rides a bicycle.
He objects. She persists. He insists. They
part. The consummating touch of anguish to his
soul was his wife’s appearance at a semi-public
entei fciinment, where she played the part of a
fairy in yellow tights and a little much-revealing
petticoat. Should a man lie ft o 1 to acknow-
ledge a wife who makes his in me ridiculous by
cutting frantic antics in male attire? That is
what this one is asking his friends. What would
Judge Windeyer say ?

The trade in the New Women’s knicker-
suits is booming. With the strange perversity of
the sex, the breeched female absolutely abhors
dressmakers, and will only don the real tailor-
make. One Sydney snip claims to have the very
lattest patterns (for which he cabled to England),
and is thriving in consequence. Moat “ panted ”
sassiety ladies only wear them in private, or among
very intimate friends.
Melb. Herald has been running a corres-
pondence on the living wage. The “Hopeful”
avers that, he finds it possible to live com-
fortably and keep a wife and five children on
255. a week, and he therefore sternly rebukes
some who have complained of large firms cut-
ting down clerks’ wages to 30s. Indian ryots
live on a few rice-grains; Parisians during the
siege lived on rats and oats. But the Australian,
in a land of plenty, who shamelessly boasts of
living comfortably and keeping a wife and five
children on 255. a week, deserves to be locked up
and fed on thin hominy in full view and smell of
a good grill,

The distress among newspaper-men in
Australia is little imagined by those outside press
circles. The secretary of a Friendly Society
lately advertised for a man to take a verbatim
shorthand note and furnish a fair transcript of a
six-days’ annual meeting. Some of the offers
sent in—and by very capable m >n, too —were
simply ridiculous ; the prices asked would little
more than keep a man in food while he was
working. If one week’s nr te-ta>ing is entered on
single-handed it means almost a month’s arduous
labor in getting out “copy,' and yet some of the
prices for the whole job were as low as £5 to £lO !
Sucn work equires much skill and experience, and
a fair rate for the task in question would have been
from £4O to £5O
* .« *
ifc costs Yic. Government £l6OO yearly to
minister to the religious wants of prisoners and
lunatics. Premier Turner has announced his
intention to retrench this sum, and religious
circles are horrified. There is a particularly
strong objection to the projected reduction of the
£5OO for sermons to lunatics. Clergymen so rarely
gut a really appreciative audience nowadays.

The Melbourne poor will have a cold time
of it this winter. Nearly all the post-and-rail
fences surrounding boom-estates have been chopped
down, and the weary, hungry-lookiug men and
women who go fossicking for firewood in early
morning with tomahawks and perambulators will
have a long search now.

The parson, as a rule, takes first prize for
assorted compliments at any wedding-breakfast
where they will let him cast his black shadow on
the wall. Bishop Goe —old soldier of the Loard
that he is—was a huge success in proposing the heal th
of bride and bridegroom at Rupertswood last week
JTleld Flowery G. didn’t fumble for his lines. He
quietly set his old reliable wedding-phonograph
working and out came the usual references to the
bride’s blushing beauty, and the bridegroi m’a
happiness, finishing up with a burst of regret over
the misfortune which Victoria was suffering in
the loss of one of her brightest jewels of woman-
hood. The word Victoria was adroitly slipped
into the space that Goe had left blank after Ids
previous repetitions of the same speech. The
name of the place which the bride is about to
depart from is subject to alteration. Otherwise a
bishop at a bridal feast doesn’t need to tax his
brain. The well-ohosen remarks are duly arranged
on the cylinder, and the veteran has only to pour
a glass of fizz down his episcopal slot when ha
wants ’em to come forth.
# * #
Apropos Shepherd Goe’s eloquent allusions
to “ the bride o’ beauty.” From an impartial point
of view, the new Mrs. Cruicksliank is a tall young
lady, fresh and ruddy of complexion., but quits
enough like Pa to convict the bishop of blarney.
Like all the Cliveden girls, however, the bride has
always shown herself a pleasant, unaffected
damsel, and Mr. Cruiokshank is to be congratu-
lated accordingly.
* * *
Yanitas. The lady who, ere her widow-
hood, used to lead Melb. society, is back fro.J
England, and lives in retirement. Unfortunately,
she has been transformed from a rich wife to a
poor widow.

A recently-departed personage’s spouse
did her best to fix up a match between the pretty
and well-gilt daughter of a Western District
(Vic.) squatter and one of her own impecunious
relatives. The lady, however, declined to face
the starting-gate.

At St. Kilda (Melb.) police-court lately,
a man, who alleged that four years ago he was
worth <£20,000, was sued for 17s. 6d. dog-rates,
and, being unable to pay, was sent to gaol for 48
hours. The dog had been dead some months.
Working out dead horses is bad enough, but to
work out dead dogs has been reserved as an after-
math of the great Smellbourne boom.

The procession of Wairarapa poems seems
endless :
You can always tell a Westralian letter by
the color of the envelope. There are stains and
streaks of reddish dust all over it, and, in addition
to the dust, there is often a faint, sickly perfume
attached to the epistle—an odour of desert and
flies and old meat-tins and other things too
numerous to mention. Westralia has a smell that
is all its own, and whoever has been there and met
it will remember it ever after as the smell of a lost
land, and a busted mine, and a lying prospectus,
and a fishy Government, and a God-forgotten
population, and as the odour of the last scrag-end
of the world generally. Having got these re-
marks off its chest The Bulletin feels rather
better.
He saved Miss Williams by his hand,
With help from shore likewise,
T. Roberts reached the shore.
With thanks and grateful t-ytg.
The Maoris to the rescue came,
And by their native skill.
Proved they were worthy of their name
As they worked with a will.
And torn by monsters of the deep
Were bodks thinly clad,
So suddenly awoke from sleep,
Tol ook on them ’twas sad.
Amid the scene and dreadful wreck
-arried by waves with force,
v\ hich no human power could check,
Was man’s dumb friend—the horse.

His ,ace was pale, his heart was full of grief he
could not speak,
His tears had cut a sluice-way down each dit b-
encrusted cheek,
And to his large blue eyes a look of fear, yet
longing, came
When he heard his old companions shouting in
their merry game.
My heart was touched. I went to him and
stroked his russet head.
"Now, what ails you this bright morning?
What’s your trouble, Jim ?” I said.
He arose and bent a brimming eye upon the
pants he wore,
And I thought I understood him —I’d been there
myself before.
Those pants were real home-made ones, and
were fearful to behold,
Very baggy fore and aft, and most obtrusively
“ half-s-ied.”
He turned about and sobbed again, and woe-
fully said he :
“They’re a dashed old pair of mother’s an
they’ve bin cut down fer me !”

When black Calamity her summons sends
Far out at sea to Dives and his wife ;
When suddenly the stormy ocean ends
In nearly painless death a joyous life—
The i weeps the world, and writes condoling books,
Inscribes on monuments the mournful date.
And hundred bards arise, with tearful looks,
To sing their fate !
But Millions suffer never-ending years
Of helpless misery, that wears and grinds
Their very hearts away. No Heaven hears
Their wails and sobs. No loving Father finds
A Home-for them. They see beyond the bar
No God, no Hope 1 For Faith has passed them by
And left Despair alone ; and so they are
Cast out of life, and yet afraid to die!
Thus millions pass unceasingly along
To perish in the flood they cannot stem—
And ne’er a hook, a stone, a simple song
Remembers them !

Miss Rossell’a dunes in “A Gaiety Girl.’* writes a
Melb. lady to Tub Hcuums, is the most exquisitely -saucy
piece of reckless grace conceivable. There is a laughing
face a pair of twinkling eyes, a cloud of draperies, and
two shapely ankles. Sometimes these elements are to he
seen separate and distinct; and then all at once the legs
go up, the skirls whirl round, the head som how gets
into the middle of the mass, ami the smile shines > ut, like
the nucleus of a comet, somewhere amid frills and feet.
Then, in a flash, the consi dial ion dissolves, and the skirls
are floating round in waves of fluttering poetry until
they are caught up in a handful, and a high-kick ob. Re-
lates the dancer and opens up visions of a petticoated
Paradise, colored like \ iolet sunset clouds.
Leading members of the Gaiety girlhood say that the
chorus supplied by “the firm” at Melh. Princess con-
sists of the finest and most beauteous set of girls they
have played with since leaving London. Some say that
even George Edwardee couldn’t heat the collection.
The adorable Ryley’s abs-nce has not lessened the
power of his hug. The beautiful Blanche Massey con.es
in for most, of Charles’ bear-like squeezes in the “ Gaiety
Girl,’* and in some scenes she gets almost lost to view m
the capacious folds of C. H.'s embrace.
Gordon's pretty scene for the second act of “ A Gaiety
Girl ” is not appreciated by one member of the company.
Fritz Rimma, who mip-rsonal.es the bathing-machine
attendant, waited Gordon in the painting-room one morn-
ing for the purpose of satisfying himself that the
cerulean sea and sky on the artist s clot h were in harmony
with the tuft and ribbons on his (Rimma’s) cap. He dis-
covered that Gordon’s color scheme had been worked out
without regard to the bathing-machine The blue
background and the blue hat trimming didn’t blend, so
the agitated Rimma, having explained that his costume
was absolutely correct and unalterable, besought Gordon
to change the tone of the heaven and ocean. Sad to say,
the painter stuck to his colors. Rimma performs his
litile, very little, part with a gleam in h s eye, expressive
of a conviction that lie has got to pull the show through
under awful difileulties.
Melbourne people note a considerable difference in Miss
Spong since she played the Fairy Queen in •* A Mid-
summer Night a D.eam.” Her graceful figure must have
gained a good 101 b.
Maud Hobson, the handsomest of the “Gaiety Girlers,"
is the link that conuecis this new comedy burlesque co.
with the p ilmy days of Gaiety leg-shows. At the tune
when Royce supplied od for the sacred lamp, M mil
Hobson was a lovely ohoms damsel. Her appearance
hasn't guff-red during the interim. Then she wore her
golden bair cut short behind, and was addict'd to
“making-up" off the stage. To-day the golden hair is
worn long, and the godd-ss's figure has attained lhe per
feci ion of plumpness; otherwise, one can see no difference
in Miss H. She was always calm and cool-lo .king, as
now. The chorus ladv wtio glorified a quiet, litile street
a' the north of Loudon, and journeyed to and fro the
Gaiety Theatre per omnibus, was not famous for her
diamonds, but they were hound to cine to her. Dia-
monds seem to grow upon a particular type of w manly
beamy, even as pearls spring from certain oyster-sbells.
Elton intends to lour with a little compa- y of his own,
after quitting Melb. Bijou. Frank Emery is organiser.
The H qies—Cecil and Arthur—are merely make-weights
in the cist of “A Gaiety Girl." They wear military or
dress clothes, and speak about six words apiece. But the
ex-army brethren are not quite valueless. They watt a
suggestion of “ haw ! ’’ across the footlights.
Another singing bird is taking flight from these shores.
The popular Josephine O'Brien leaves for England on
April 27. In doing so she follows the advice of Santlcy,
who predicted great tilings for tier.
The dresses worn by the Gaiety Co. during the first
week in Melb. were those used during the American tour.
New and gorg ons raiment of almost bewildering mag ifi-
cence arrived from London List week. T.ie only gowns (?)
that have not been alterei are the next-to-nollung bath-
ing-suits worn in tile s cond act.
Miss Maud Rissell, the wonderful pas sett? dancer of
the Gaiety Co., is a native of Cap- C mmy. in her own
line she is considered the best that Melbourne h*s ever
seen. She became the favorite at one —is recalled ihree
times at every app arance, and would be recalled six if
she would only come but.
Decim t Moore’s speaking voice is the most, melodious
that lias been b-ard on the Australian stage for many a
day. Toe little lady sings charmingly ; hut, toaonltl-
vUedear.it is a rare pleasure to hear-her Say her lines.
To -re is something sweetly flutey in her ton'es.
Hilda Spong is such a wiqsomely pretty actress that it
is a pity she doesn't take pains to grow out of that cork-
screw walk of hers. S ie walks with her shoulders curving
backwards and forwards like shuttles. Opinio iof Ip rin
Melbourne, where she is now playing in “ A Span of
Life,’’ is that she lias made great strides as an actress
since her last appe trance—a year ago, or more.
Has anvbody noticed that Falter (the stage-name of
Beryl Fab r, of the B. and B. 0».) is Latin for Smith ?
The clev-r lady is a sister of C. A. Smith, who preceded
“ Billy ’’ Murdoch as captain of the Sussex ci ickel-t am.
This same Smith gave up stock-broking and cricket
reoenrlv for the boards, and has just joined John Hare 8
Garrick Co. He may lie out here next year with the
veteran actor. Smith was known at. Cambridge as
“ Rouinl-tbe Corner Smith," owing to his wild and loose
style of bowling.
A handsome and much-photographed theatrical Lo-
thario has transferred his affections from his erstwhile
"colonial” flame to a more substantial charmer from over
the pond.
The manager of a Melb. juvenile minstrel co., which
has been playing to crowded houses down South for over
a year, has been clearing upwuds of £25 weekly after
ex.’s, and is going, on dit, to sell out his Melb. connection
with the intention of commencing a juvenile minstrel co.
in Sydney and suburbs on the "silver coin” principle.
Should he “catch on,” as in Melbourne, Ihe various
theatrical managers will use st rong swear-words.
The Marquis of Qneensberry lately went, to St. James’s
Theatre, on the first night of Oscar Wilde’s new play,
arm (I with a bunch of carrots, which he intended to
bestow on theaulhor. Manager Alexander having been
told of the noble marquis’s design, “Q.” was refused
admittance at the door, and had to be content with heav-
ing ihe vegetables at the box-otlice,
“Johnny” Gourlay is under engagement to Join
Snazelle in London, in Sept., when they will appear at
Toole’s in an up-to-date version of “ Skipped by the Light
of tile Moon.”
Melb. applauded “ The Rock of Ages” more loudly than
any of the other tableaux at the Princess’s, The Holy
City.
Pro.: "At the ‘Gaiety Girl ’ rehearsals, one noted how
entirely the manager has conquered the actor in acting at
repetitions. A generation ago nobody acted in rehearsal.
However, managers began to insist on it, but, for long,
could not affect any of the principals. Gradually, the
thing wni ki d round, till now every rehearsal is a per-
formance. Tlie old style was to learn your words, and
that was all; hut Lite intricacies of stage business now will
not allow artists even like Miss Hobson and Monkhous'
to slop their rehearsing, unless the manager says 4 Nevei
mind that bit." ”
They now call it Oscarlation I
Alma Obrey, the little lady with the rich, fruity voice,
leaves Rickards’ show for London at an early date.
In M.L., the other day, a jealous actress having
ascertained that her husband had given a bouquet tu
another stage lady, wait'd upon the latter and bit her on
the cheek. 44 Law “ follows.
Mis* Marguerite Johnson, a soprano just out from
Maorilahd, is warbling ballads at Hobart Exhibition with
special success.
Edward Solomon, composer of 44 The Vicar of Bray,
left personal estate sworn at 1100 only. The poor fellow
must have been a ‘ 4 converted " Jew.
44 In Town” and 44 The Slop Girl” will he played in
Mell>. for the first time out of London by the Gaiety
The ’Murkans were so struck on the “Girl” that they
would have nothing else.
Decima Moore, Harry Monkhouse, Fred. Kaye, and
Louis Brad Held have signed to play for a year at Daly r
Theatre, London. They are due there Oct. 1, so the
advertised 15 weeks’ season here seems genuine this time.
An amateur dramatic club in Melh. is rehearsing 44 The
Times." Brough and Boueicault scored a failure in
this play, hut tire amateurs quite expect to make a
triumph with it.
Mr. Percy Bates, who was so well received at the Good
Friday sacred concert at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, when
he re dered with much acceptance, 14 Now Vanish Before
the Holy Beams,” and 44 In Native Worth,” is a native ol
N.S.W. He is barely 26 years of ace, and is the pos-
sessor of a very sweet tenor voice. Having no friends
behind him, he has had to woik his own way in musical
circles, although to the Sydney Liederlafel belongs the
credit of having 44 discovered ” him.
Sophie Harris, the large and leggy Adelaide girl, has
already been encaged as principal boy for Oscar Barrett's
next London pantomime.
The stately Miss Dudley—she of the deep voice and
stage-shaking tread, who made so howling a success in
Svdney—has a part in the new Adelphi production. The
great Pinero stands professional sponsor for this actress,
and he it was who recommended her to B. and B.
The artistic poster instituted in Paris by Jules
and now the rage in that city and London, makes its first
appeaiacce here in the 4> Gaiety Girl” hills. These were
designed by Dudley Hardy, and show a very snappy
m iden in a soarlet gown with flying boa-ends and hat-
ribbons, upon whose laughing face it is good to gaze in
these dull times.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
Fielders have had a rich and rare Sydney
month. Public form was utterly at a discount— through
a combination of b d weather, incompetent horseman,
ship and overtrained horses.
K * • * •
X. : “ Isn’t it time 3*mile races were abolished ?
Two or 2J miles are quite sufficient to test the stamina of
any horse, and races above the distance are simply cruel
farces. It. was painful to witness the finish for the A. J.C.
Plate, for. although that race was not run in very wonder-
ful time(smin. 38sec.), yet Havoc, Clesterman and The
Harvester were so distressed that they bump'd and reeled
like drunken men.”
• • * •
Now that Bob Ray has beaten botli Wallace
and Challenger, he stands out rather prominently as a
Derby candidate with a rosy chance. O’Brien covets that
Vic. blue ribbon of which Ensign robbed Carbine by a
head. Wallace may he Ihe winter favorite, but a lot may
transpire in the next six months.
• • • *
Walter Hale and his veteran trainer, Lamond,
thoroughly deserve their successes with Delaware and
Oxide—these not having been trained and raced off 0" b
legs. Delaware especially has been most judiciously
treated, and has every appearance of developing inio u
Cup horse.
* • * •
Why don’t owners make a move in the direct!' n
of m-rcy by taking away their Jock ys’ (? whips? Tie
damage done to horses by injudicious and indisciiiniua'e
flogging is incalculable. To see a boise win ing a classic
race bv tin eel n the, under severe pnnisl ment.is sick' > -
ing. And ihe majority of the finishes at Kaudwick were
characterised by frighiful abuses of the “ flail.”
» * • *
It is not often such a finish is seen in a three-
mile raee as in the A.J.C. Plate, at Randan k, on Sam--
day. At the half distance Havoc., Gin sternum, ai d The
Harvester were running level. Havoc on the rails, and
Harvester on the outside. All three were gr gvy, and
Havoc boring out pushed Chest er in an on to Harvester.
Etheridg-could not get his whip hand clear on Cheslei
man, and Havoc, having all the hest of the sernnm iv,
WOO by half a length from Chestennau, who was a few
inches ah ad of The Harvester. All tine- were much dis
tressed; and it makes a latter-day raoe-voer wonder
what sort the prads were in the old days to run off their
three and four mile heats in an afternoon.
* • ♦ •
A protest on behalf of Chestennau, eventually
dismissed, was not decided until 7 o'clock, hundreds wait-
ing to hear the decision. Outside evidence galore was
called, hut. wherefore no one hut the Stewards could say.
The alleged interference occurred right under the Judge's
box, and, as the Stewards had ocular demonstration for it,
it is’hard to say of what use witnesses-in all cases in-
terested—were in coming to a decision.
• • • •
It must be out of pure oussedness that tin-
A.J.C. leaves that paling-fence in the straight at the finish
of the Steeplechase-course. Owners, jockeys, the public—
in fact, everybody but the committeemen,*who, by the way,
would soon'have it removed if their precious necks we e
in jeopardy—are agreed on removing it; a"d if a fat d
accident does happen there some day those responsil 1
should be tried for manslaughter. Highborn 11., aft r
negotiating the stiff course in faultless style on Saturday,
showed an inclination to baulk at the palings.
♦ * • *
Out of six races at Maribyrnong on Saturday,
four first and two second favorites got home. Sep. Millet
had three wins; his two-year-old filly, Tieja, won the
Trial Slakes and Footscray Handicap, both 5J furlongs,
done in Imin. 6sec. and Imin. 4|sec. respectively. Th
Indian a black geld'.nr of Miller’s, carrying 12st. 51h.,
romped home in th • Hurdle Race, for which he was
backed down to sto 4 on. .
• • ♦ • -
It is said Mr. Long only put half a sovereign on
Patroness in Sydney Cup, the stable going for Quiver •> t
the s'length of a trial gallop. One of the few to make n
decent win on Patroness was “Jim” Toohey, now on Ins
wav to England. He wired over a score from Albany to
put on the mare, and it resulted in a win if £4OO, of whtc.i
James will not be aware until he reaches ’Dine.
♦ » • ♦
Sheet Anchor’s name seems in no danger of
dying out. At Caulfield races the other day two of his
gel, Dnballow and Our Jack, were sm dessful, while at
about the same time The Hat V ester was pul I ing down the
weigbt-for-nge contestants, it is noticeable that the
whole three started favorites.
• • • •
Some horses dearly love racing. In Caulfield
steeplechase Warrior lost his jockey soon after the start,
but he at once got up and raced away “On his own,”
jumping the remaining fences faultlessly and finishing
fourth. $
After boom comes burst. The slowgoing A. J.C.
can afford to smile at ttie shrinkage in the V.R.C. stakes.
* • ♦ •
G. G. Stead, the Capt. Machell of Maorilaml,
has a happy turn for nomenclature —as witness bis i rack
nv •ai old Bloodshot, Maxim-Iris.

The measuring of ponies and galloways at
Sydney Agricultural Show was more worthy of a pony
racemeeting than the premier agricultural show. In one
case the man in charge of the rule declared an animal
over-height. Then another measurer came along, and,
taking the stick in hand, said the mare was only a shade
over the height, and as he allowed half an-jnch for the
shoes she could compete. Compete she did, and was
awarded first prize. In ano'her case “Watson’s certifi-
cate’’ was accepted. Mr. Webster distinctly stated to
competitors before the show opened that only the official
measurement on the ground won d he accepted, and that
if any animal failed to go under, the owner would ho
allowed to knock the shoes off, lint the allowing of half-
art inch for the shoes appeared to be an impromptu rule
mad •* on the spot.

The N.S.W. Agricultural Society’s trot ended
in a fiasco. The committee postponed it from Easter
Monday to Tuesday on account of the course, but on the
Tuesday the mud was even worse and more sticky than
on the previous day. The harness horses were out of it
from the start, as each snlkv picked up the best part of a
ton of mud. In the final, what promised to be a great
finish between Maggie and Torrent was spoilt by a horse
getting loose on the track and galloping round with the
trotters, breaking them up and flinging mud in the faces
of the riders. Maggie eventually won a most unsatis-
factory race from Torrent.

The year’s finances of Tattersall’sclnb. Sydney,
are unsatisfactory. In its r> port the committee brings
under the notice of members the enormous demand by way
of rent fmm the A. J.O. for the use of Hand wick racecourse,
the tariff fixed amounting to £1516 10s. per annum for
four days’ racing. This one incident had disclosed a loss
of £237, and to this alone was attributed the deficiency on
the season’s business.

The Australasian publishes two views of the
boxes in which Carbine and his son and heir, Novelette,
who will come into the property when the oM horse dies,
are voyaging to England. It adds:—“The boxes for the
accommodation of Carbine and his son, the Novelette
colt, are on the upper deck of the Orizaba, just ahaft the
gangway. They are practically deck-houses, over seven
feet in height, and very stronglvconstructed of hardwood.
Th * low“r portions of the interiors are padded to a height
of four feet, while the upper framework is so fitted with
bais as to give ample light and ventilation, with protec-
tion from water in rough weather. The two boxes are
arranged so that the horses will have a full view of each
Other. The (are for each horse is that of a first-class pas-
senger.” Tois picture of the horS“S having a full view of
each other is very touching. And did anybody ever sup-
pose that Carbine would rank as a steerage passenger?

The N.S.W. Easter Encampment folly
has, no doubt, given the doctors more than the
usual amount of work in the shape of pneumonia,
bronchitis, and rheumatism. The several regi-

rain, and returned to camp wet through to pass
the night, after presumably drying their clothes
at hig bonfires in their bell-tents, in an atmosphere
like that of a steam-laundry.

Can W. P. Crick’s Parliamentary utter-
ances on the George Dean case, a case in which he
was professionally engaged, be made the subject of
consideration by N.S.W. Law Institute? The
question was affirmatively answered by several
practitioners during the last few days. It is
admitted, of course, that he is privileged in a
general sense, but the Institute claims club powers
as well as court ones. The Bulletin would much
like to see the Law Institute interfering with
a member’s Parliamentary privilege.
A teamster coming from Menzies’ to
Southern Cross, the other day, found a man on the
roadside who had been so long food less and thirsty
that he could neither stand nor speak. He got
him at length into ilia waggon and gave him
brandy, but the poor fellow died a few minutes
afterwards, and was buried in the sand with a rug
around him.

larly as the Customs-man and the health-officer.

Mr. P. R. Larkin, of George street, Hay-
market (Sydney), the well-known importer and
wholesale and retail wine and spirit merchant,
has gone on a trip to England, and his almost
equally well-known manager, Mr. P. Byrne,
remains in charge during his absence. Despite
the constant assurances of the long-haired fanatic
that teetutalism is coming, Mr. Larkin’s big
establishment has grown and prospered and
become steadily bigger for many years past, and
the owner invites—by advertisement—all Govern-
ment inspectors, analysts, and other official
or unofficial connoisseurs to come and examine
his stock, and do their b-st to find one single
bottle of anything which won’t, stand the
closest inspection. As he hasn’t been hauled up
and fined, despite this challenge, the assumption
is that his liquor is among the very few samples
which has stood inspection. And, as man will
drink, despite all arguments to the contrary—will
drink good liquor when he can get it, and bad
liquor when he can’t get good, and awful liquor
when he can’t get liquor that is only moderately
bad, but insists on drinking, anyhow—Mr.
Larkin’s depot is probably a blessing to the com-
munity, and its owner a public benefactor.

latter was about to “lightup ” when a mate sung
out: “Roll up. South and cockatoos ! Hero’s a

Matthew Davies the other day defended a
waiter who had “shaken” .£l3 worth of cutlery
and table-linen from the local Stock Exchange
Club. The lawyer’s appeal on behalf of his unfor-
tunate client was a rather choice specimen of senti-
ment current (though fortunately not in Daviesian
circles) during boom-tirne. The waiter, said
Matthew D*, had had plenty of opportunities of
being'dishonest during the past seven years, “ but
no charge of that kind had been brought against
him before. The present trouble seemed to have
arisen out of some idea of perquisites, which waiters
thought they were entitled to.” The Bench
thought the waiter was entitled . to three months,
which he got. Mistaken ideas concerning other
people’s property lead to the dungeon-cell—in a
waiter’s case.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Does death end all? Is there no more to come?
Has she, whom now within the earth we sink,
Lived her whole life, or stands she on the brink
Of some new world whose glory struck her dumb,
Whose awe has tilled her with amaze, mads numb
And cold her body ? Is the grave a link
Between two worlds ? Or do men falsely think,
And is this life we know the end and sum ?
We see the eyelids droop ; no more we hear
The heart-beats in the bosom, soft and low ;
A smile of peace comes as the end draws near ;
The lines of pain and anguish vanish slow.
Is death a friend to love ? A foe to fear ?
The quick know not, nor shall they ever know.

then, on the Tuesday morning, we should, per-

The man who stands beside Oscar Wilde

person in criminal practices. Notorious ! Then
what have the police to say for themselves ? The
most disgusting revelation of the hideous case is
the revelation that it deals with matters of upper-
class knowledge which the authorities have been
carefully guarding from the light. Wilde’s fellow-
prisoner was “notorious” among the—haw!—

knew him not.

Dear Bulletin,—If ever the services of
the Devil s advocate deserve to be evoked it is in
the case of your Mr. George Ash, M.P.
I have had the pleasure of listening on more than
one occasion to this gentleman’s speeches in Parlia-
ment, and of all the maudlin twaddle I ever heard,
his is by far the worst. In one of your paragraphs
you mention that Mr. Ash once went into court
with a stack of books, and won his case by a threat
to go on talking for a week if necessary. That is
an accurate description of Mr. Ash. I can quite
enter into the spirit which caused the magistrates
to grant his case after hearing an hour of him.
In the House he is for ever reeling off long, mono-
tonous, Conservative diatribes against the Labor
idea with a deplorable cockney twang. True, he
is Kingston’s partner, and this shows that C.O.K.
is alive to the fact that it is not a bad thing “in
the law ” for one partner to be on each side,
as of old the Scottish families sent the elder sou
to hustle for the Pretender while the younger
barracked for King George, or the Irish families
made one son a Catholic and the other a
Protestant, so that whichever turned up trumps
they held a good hand. It may be that Mr. Ash
has worked to qualify himself for the law. But
does that justify him in talking hidebound .Con-
servative bosh in the Legislative Assembly of a
progressive country ? Take a foot in height and 20
■years in age off Wingen Abbott, and, minus the
cockney accent, you have Mr. George Ash (or
Hash, as he probably calls himself). What’s the
matter with brilliant Democratic Australians that
The Bulletin should waste ink and paper on
such prosy nonentities as Ash? Those who re-
member Gordon’s speech in the Convention when
he dressed down-Parkes—then the roaring-lion of
Australian statesmanship—know that he has
brilliancy and courage inferior to no one in Aus-
tralia. And yet I have never seen a column of
your space devoted to his praise, as was the case
with Ash.—Yours,
AUSTRALIAN.

Blake’s Steam Pumps are the Best.
There are more Blake Pumps in use than there are of any other make, anfl they have been adopted
by the largest Steam Engine and Steamship Builders in all countries, as well as by the Naval Depart-
ments of the English, United States and Russian Governments. The Blake Pump is in operation in
many town and city waterworks, iron, coal, silver and gold mines, and on the extensive pipes lines of
the oil regions of America and Russia. We claim “ the Blake Pump as the Standard Steam Pump,”
It having been fully recognised as such, as our extensive
and increasing sales testify. It has been pronounced by
mechanical experts and engineers to be the Best Steam
Pump, for the following reasons, viz.:
It is simple in construction 1
It is positive under any pressure !
It is operated by the common it slide valve !
It is durable and well arrai ged in all its parts 1
It is made from improved designs and new patterns!
It is made of the best matbfials, in the most workman-
like manner!
It is arranged with large valve areas, free water pas-
sages and large ports 1
It will start at any point of stroke, and discharge the
water of condensation !
It will not break down when suddenly started, as in the
case of an alarm of fire, etc. !
It will run at any speed—slower or faster than any
ol her steam pump of same dimensions !
It will pump all kinds of liquids, hot or cold, thick or
thin, clear or gritty, and varying in specific gravity
from alcohol to while lead !
It is economical in its operation, requiring bss steam
for a given amount of work than any other steam
-— pump to be found in the market!
It is interchangeable in all its working parts, so that in case of wear or accidental bnakage, duplicate parts can be
immediately supplied 1
It will work without shock or vibration, and can be operated with water or air pressure as well as steam, an
important feature in case of being submerged or “drowned out,” as is often the case in mines, etc.
Every Pump is thoroughly tested before shipment, and fully warranted by us.

The Snake Poison Controversy ,
Db. Mueller writes to The Bulletin from
Yackandandah, Vic. Dear Bulletin, —That
‘Steele Grey ’ has left unheeded repeated challenges
from tne in the Australasian Medical Gazette,
and that even now he fights under a pen-name,
goes far to show that he has not much confidence
in his own argument. And how can Ibe offen-
sively personal to him when his personality is not
disclosed ? There is much in a name, but people
writing under false names must put up with a
little rough handling.
“The question asked by ‘Steele Grey’ :
‘ Does snake poison act on the blood only,
on the nervous system only, or on both ? ’ is
cunningly put, but is not at all the question
at issue. It acts on both, no doubt; but
the real question is : Are the blood-changes the
direct effect of the poison and the cause of death ?
or are they secondary and unimportant, all fully
explainable by changes in the innervation of the
organs of circulation and consequent derangement
of the latter function? I have shown conclusively
in my book on snake-poison that the latter is the
only tenable explanation of the blood-changes we
observe in poisoning by snake venom ; and no
attempt has ever been made by my opponents to
disprove the arguments there put forth. All they
have done thus far has been to pass them by
superciliously; to adduce (like S.G.) a number of
authorities in favor of the blood-poison theory,
and then indulge'in the fond illusion of having
proved their case and annihilated me.
“Yet how easily might they convince themselves
of their error by a few simple experiments. If S.G.,
for instance, would only take the dark fluid blood of
one of his snake-poisoned animals, and beat it
whilst yet warm with a whisk, freely exposed to
the air, he would get bright red, coagulable blood
again, in its vital elements not differing under the
microscope from any healthy blood taken from an
animal of the same species. But, lest his micro-
scope might deceive him once more, or the experi-
ment appear too simple for him, I will give him a
more complicated, but also more convincing one
to perform. Let him inject a fatal dose of snake-
poison under the skin of a dog, cat, guinea-pig, or
any animal he fancies, wait till his victim becomes
more or less insensible to pain, then strap it down
on its back and open both chest and abdomen
without injuring any of the organs in these cavi-
ties. He will find the heart beating very feebly,
the blood pressure at zero, and the blood more
iind more accumulating in the large veins of
the abdomen. Now let his assistant have
the warm defibrinised blood of four animals of
the same species and size ready, together with
a good infusion apparatus; let him inject the
blood into one of the jugular veins, and, after pass-
ing through the wholeof the animal, let it flow out
of one of the crural arteries ; let him stop the flow
immediately after he has injected all the blood,
and also close the jugular vein, thus leaving only
the normal quantity of blood in the animal. It
must be plain to mere common sense that, if blood
poisoning were the cause of the animal’s condition,
that condition must be changed for one of com-
parative health after every drop of the poisoned
blood has been washed out of its vessels. But
such is not the case, for the snake-poison has taken
firm hold of the delicate nerve cells, and turned off
the life-currents flowing from these millions of
small batteries. Hence the blood pressure sinks to
zero again as soon as the infusion is stopped ; the
heartbeats as feebly as before, and thesluggish blood
stream comes to ever-increasing stagnation in the
abdominal veins—where, in consequence, the
changes in the appearance of the blood take place,
on which the whole of this absurd blood-poison
theory is founded.
“But another objection to this theory (and
a most weighty one) must occur to the
educated layman who has the least idea of the
elements of physiology. If the millions upon
millions of blood corpuscles, each of which is a
separate entity and performs special functions, are
so vitally injured by the snake-venom as to become
incapable of carrying on these functions, how, he
will ask, can a person dying from snake-bite
through disease or death of the corpuscles, be re-
stored to perfect health within a few hours by a
remedy that has no direct effect on the blood, but
only acts on the nerve cells ? Strychnine has
done this time after time in Australia, and is
now repeating the same performance in India.
When respiration and heart-action are all
but suspended, and the body is as cold as
a corpse, death can only be a question of
a few minutes; and there can be no talking
about a ‘ false cause ’ if cause and effect are linked
together in ever-repeating succession. A case or
two of recovery from this condition after a few
well-timed strychnine injections may be passed
over on the post hoc ergo propter hoc argument,
but applied to dozens of them the argument
becomes puerile; more especially when confronted
by the undeniable fact that, since the introduction
and proper use of my treatment, the mortality
from snake-bite in Australia has steadily decreased
from year to year, and is now almost nil. I, at
least, have seen no fatal cases recorded last
season [there seems to have been six within
the last few weeks. —Ed. B.]; and have
looked in vain for such in the present
one, now more than half over. In the face
of these facts the authorities quoted by S.G.
go for nothing, even if he could multiply them a
hundred times. The age of authoritative faith is
passed —in science at least. Any exploded theory
may be backed up by authorities. Let S.G. and
his authorities disprove Eeoktistow’s and Robert’s
experiments, and do away with the vast array of
evidence that proves the correctness of my theory
and treatment. When they have accomplished
this task we will hear them and return once more
to the old confusion of ideas now happily becom-
ing clearer.
“To enlighten S.G. appears a hopeless task.
Pro bono publico, however, I will make an
attempt. First, as to the ‘ blood clots filling the
chambers of the heart,’when the poison is injected
/.ito the blood stream and death is almost instan-
taneous. The idea that they are caused by direct
chemical action of the poison, that they precede
death and are the cause of it, is absurd, and must
make alma mater blush ; for snake poison mixed
with blood as it flows from a vein or artery has no
such effect, no matter in what proportion it is
added, and a simple experiment will show this.
When the heart is suddenly paralysed whilst full
of blood, and this blood is not yet overcharged with
car bon i c acid, th e blood con geals as soon as i t becom es
stationary, which is, of course, after death. When,
on the other hand, the poison is injected under
the skin and its action is more or less protracted
’ n consec B °f slower absorption into the blood
Bt . rea L m > J/\ e l)lood accumulates in the large veins
? f fc . he abdomen, becomes over-charged with car-
borne acid, and remains liquid after death ; the
{\ earc ’. n tb, f ca , se “inR comparatively empty, as
“ le adlma } lias been bled into its own belly. But,
d , oS P' te th . ls difference in appearance, paralysis of
the heart is the cause of death in each case. The
hails of science should ring with laughter at two
University men declaring blood-clots in the heart
after sudden death from snake poison to be ante-
formations, as if snake poison acted like
Perchlonde of ironi and similar substances. The
only effect snake poison has upon the blood is to dis-
so the stroma of the corpuscles and set the hsemo-
S lob, . n free m the plasma, m which latter it seems
J? dimmish the discs, or plates; but the effect on
" be s f r . olna takes place only where, as on the bitten
s P ot - ,fc , comes lnto contact with the blood cor-
P} lsc , es a concentrated form. It makes the
. ood visibly thinner here, instead of congealing
1 ,, ~ . ,
~ .y learned opponents pleading for the
ch ‘9 rlde of T h ' ne treatment requires no further
n °tice, as 1 have already pointed out the very
narrow limits within which this drug may be tried
w, “‘* . 6 mast hope of success. Surely, when
removing all the blood from a poisoned animal
and re Piacing it by healthy Wood does not do
away withia single symptom, no chemical antidote
ever will do it. io catch the poison with it is the
dl ™ cult y> and the use of t*m drug is as hopeless,
u , ess * il l s 18 don ®> as would be the attempt to put
!l a a bare 8 ad without first catching the hare,
I shall not take up yourspace by replying to the con-
eluding portion of Steele Grey’s’effusion, since it
w purely personal and he hides his own personality
uwder a mask. It is plain from his letter that he
" as studied the subject of snake-poisons, but
®P ua plain that a hopeless confusion of ideas is
the only result he has so far achieved. That a
* ew l® s ? ons from an obscure Australian country
practitioner will bring some light into the Cim-
merian darkness of his snake lore, I am the last to
expect. My object in writing to you at such
length has been to expose his ignorance on the
subject and to prevent the public from being mis-
*?. Having accomplished this I now close

His "Perish."
[ FOR THE BULLETIN .]
Evening at Carey’s Lake; and the prospectors
around the fire, mingling their tobacco with the
strong scent of the burning sandal-wood. As
usual, Scotty and old Mat had the floor, and no
one interfered in their rivalry of reminiscence—
and invention. Scotty had been to Kimberley,
the Nullagine, and the Ashburton, while old Mat
could tell of every rush “on the otherside ” since
the Oxley. Indeed, on certain occasions he would
hint of Sacramento and ’49, but not on soak-water
—whisky was required for such feats, and whisky
at Carey’s Lake was but a dream of home.
While Mat was concluding, Scotty was racking
his brain. Something new was required ; the com-
pany were tired of the eternal sand-plain, salt-
bush, dead horse and dying man of these narra-
tives.
Said Mat; “ . . . and they gave me rum
and maizena wid a spoon, and it was three weeks
before I reginerated ; and even thin I was so pale
and worn that I was like a man whose corpse
has come to loife again, so dead did I look. And
now, if there’s another man on the field,” cock-
ing his eye at Scotty, “or any man anywhere
who’s come aloiye through such har-r-dship as
that—well, I’d like to take shtock of him, that’s
all!’’
An unexpected voice said quietly, “Here he is,
Mat!” It was young Dick, who had been lying
on his arm gazing at the stars.
Mat turned with contempt on the laugh that
ensued. “That spinifex on your chin’ll have to
grow into hair before ye can do that, my son.”
Dick without moving said; “I’m not joking,
boys, and I tell Mat that I’ve done a worse perish
than either he or Scotty has.”
“ Did ye ever have your lips glued together wid
thirst so that they bled whin ye opened them?”
“ Not that I remember.”
Then Scotty : “Did you ever pick oats out of
horse-droppings ?”
“Can’t say.”
“Do you know what it is to be timpted to
shthrike down a poor divil of a mate as thirsty
and as mad as yerself ? Answer me that, now!”
“Pile it on, Mat!’’
“ Ah, pray to God that ye never may, me little
bit of a new-chum. Why, I’ve seen men 40 years
?your betters—wan minute like you at the fire, and
‘the next go off into scrub like this around us and
‘never come back agin. You and your exparienoes!
May be ye did widout your dinner whin you
'was.wan of the unemployed-?”
“lli Have done without my dinner, and I have
• 'done a‘bigger perish than yours, Mat.”
“ Ahdi-h, you’re talking rniscellane-eously.’
ißut alLpressed Dick to go on, and he did.
“‘Whan I,came up to Coolgardie three months
ago I got a job of storekeeping out at Linger-an’-
die. The boss was a German, who used to drive
out every few weeks from the Feather with stores.
Good gold was being got and business was lively.
I bought a share in a dry-blower, too, and got a
few weights a week out of it. After a while,
though, things grew s’ack ; the place was getting
worked out; men were leaving, and the boss talked
of shifting, letting the stock run low. But sud-
denly a rush broke out forty miles away. It
afterwards proved to be one of the usual penny-
weight duffers, but just then the men were fairly
mad on it. A team started, and that night I was
clean sold out. I was up the whole time, selling
tins of meat and bags of flour ; and by morning I
had none left beyond the little I had put aside for
my own use. Of course, it was good biz, for the
last few bags went at a ten-shilling rise, and the
meat was nearly doubled next day. Finding my-
self alone, I went down to the workings, and tried
a dish or two from a few abandoned claims. When
I came back there was a note on the counter, with
money, saying that the writer had taken all the
flour and meat he could find, and that if the
money was not enough please enter it to T.
Squires. He had taken my tucker, not knowing
perhaps, or not earing, and I had nothing to face
the ten days before I expected the boss’s arrival.
I then turned out the store. I found some tins of
curry, two bottles of pickles, one tin of Bartlett
pears—and twelve tins of plum-pudding.”
“What ! ye call that hardships wid such
luxuries? ’’
“ Wait, Mat. Did you ever try to live for ten
days on plum-pudding? I tell you it was the
most frightfully sickening nightmare you could
imagine. Plumpudding—morning, noon, and
night! I’d get sick and try to leave it alone, and
then I’d become hungry and eat it, and be sick
again. I tried it hot and cold ; I tried to pick
out the plums ; I tried to dish it up with the
pickles—anything for a variation. I believe one
day I curried some fried-but I won’t be sure of
that, because towards the end I was in a real
drunken stupor,”
“ Oh, how could that be? ”
“I was—the boss said I was lying on the ground
blue in the face, and it took two hours to revive
me. ”
“ Absurd, Dicky ! How could duff .”
“ ’Twasn’t the duff directly—it was the chloro-
dyne. I had to take it constantly.”
J. H. GREENE.

brother, has proclaimed his friendship for England. A
force of British bayonets has therefore been despatched
to secure his rights and restore order in his kingdom.”—
Cable.
In Scripture we come on this sentiment odd :
“Who hateth his brother can not love his God.”
But what if he slays him ? There’s no place called
“ Quod ”
For the man who is “friendly to England.”
Did Mr. F. Deeming (now talked of as “late”)
Bub rule o’er Chitral, or some similar state,
At his death what a pathos and grief would appear
In Britannia’s lament o’er “ a noble career ”
“He ever was friendly to England 1 ”
He never permitted his virtue to roam,
But embedded his love in his hearth and his home;
While his life all along showed a worthy intent
In his liking for England—and Portland cement !
Though thousands may suffer and have to endure
All the torments of want, of one thing be sure,
The man who’s a Ruler need never be poor—
If only he’s “friendly to England.”
P.R.
In a Back Lane .
[ FOR THE BULLETIN .]
In the front street the houses are eminently
respectable; with little imagination one can detect
a certain smugness and complacence in the expres-
sion of the prim, soberly-painted house-fronts
mirroring the stupid propriety of the straight-
laced, conventional, middle-class dwellers. A
church nestles amongst the willows opposite, and
there is not a hotel within sight.
You catch the hoarse shrieks of women, and a
grinning youngster hurrying by informs you that
Mrs. Gleeson and Mrs. Murty are “ at it again.”
Out in the narrow back lane, littered with boiled
potatoes, scraps of vegetables, sections of dis-
carded wearing apparel, and filled with the reek
of stagnant gutters choked with garbage, Mrs.
Gleeson and Mrs. Murty face each other from the
doorways of their respective hovels. Mrs. Glee-
son—a shapeless, elephantine mass surmounted by
a repulsive face as destitute of lineaments as a roll
of beef, puffy, raw, steaming—shakes a stumpy fore-
finger at her enemy, and screams a volley of vile
oaths. Mrs. Murty—tall, thin, and pale, with
blue lines for lips, and expressionless eyes—
doggedly mouths one horrible insult in a mono-
tonous voice.
Both women are brutally drunk. In their
sober moments they are good friends, up to the
sixth “three-penn’orth more” they are doting
sisters; and they always end like this, shrieking
the vilest language of England, America and Aus-
tralia into each other’s faces, and fighting like
beasts in the gutter.
Mrs. Gleeson is resourceful and swears fearfully.
The neighbors say she was a lady once, and is
educated. Certainly she swears with devilish
facility and a full knowledge of the Scrip-
tures. Her language is terrible in its hideous
blasphemy, combining the most sacred names and
things with all that is loathsome in life. The lane
is filled with children ; little girls, tidily dressed,
some carrying school-books, stand at a safe dis-
tance, wide-eyed and gaping, drinking in the vile
words. Respectable housewives peep out of back
gates, and here and there bare-headed men stand
with folded arms, grinning and exchanging weak,
callous jokes.
In the corner of Mr. Elder’s back garden,
screened from sight by the laden vines, a pale,
fair-haired, slim girl of eighteen is crouched, peer-
ing through a knot-hole in the fence, trembling in
every limb, eager to catch every word, fascinated
by the dreadful scene and the dreadful sounds.
This is the sad-faced, saintly girl who goes so
regularly to church between Brother Elder and
his good wife every Sunday morning. Go 1 knows
what Mrs. Gleeson and Mrs. Murty have done
for her.
Now the two women have met, and are fighting
in the middle of the lane. This is Mrs. Murty’s
opportunity. In the battle of oaths she can only
catch up and chant the other’s vilest phrases, now
she is in her element. Mrs. Glees m, heavy and
unwieldy, throws her fat hands about blindly;
Mrs. Murty strikes fierce, tigerish blows, and soon
the other’s face streams with blood. The little
girls cling together and watch the struggle,
frightened, but held by soma strange, hateful,
animal desire. The boys caper about the com-
batants, yelling—full of delight. The bare-headed
men have withdrawn into their own yards, and
watch the fight over their fences. They are
cautious. Heaven knows what might happen
and it doesn’t do to be mixed up in affairs of this
kind even at an inquest.
Only a girl offers to separate the women—Mrs;
Gleeson’s daughter, about 17, of the factory tvpe,
dull-faced and unattractive. She exposes herself
to the blows of the she-devils. “ You leave my
mother alone ! You leave my mother alone 1” she
repeats again and again, and separates them at
last, and stands between them, with torn hair and
her face cut and bleeding. The two women return
to their doors once more, and the torrents of
dreadful words flow on again like sewers heavy
with the corruption of civilisation.
At this stage Murty, a small, nervous-looking,
grey-bearded man, shows his pinched face at the
gate, and Gleeson strolls up by the side of his
house. Gleeson is a tremendously tall man, with
the face of an old ewe. The husbands nod solemnly
and fraternally at each other across the lane, and
then, moved by a more ferocious outburst from the
women, creep out of sight, and are seen no more.
The awful quarrel is kept up for two hours,
perhaps. Mrs. Gleeson is the first to collapse, but
Mrs. Murty is rich entertainment for the crowd,
during the whole day, and may be heard shrieking
long after midnight. Possibly, before the hot day
is done, she will be crawling about upon her hands;
and knees to the unspeakable delight of the boys,
picking up invisible coins and gasping— ••
“Ho, thrippny bits —thrippny bits ! ”

Dear Bulletin, A tight place. One
Queen’s birthday, while walking along Queen-
street, Brisbane, I was startled by a loud report,
just after which a man, about 30 yards ahead of
me, bounded in the air and then fell prostrate.
A crowd at once collected, and, after a few brief
inquiries, I was able to assure the victim that the
rotten banana that clung to his temples was not
“ brains ’’after all, but that he had been accidentally
hit with a bad banana thrown from a fruit-shop
precisely at the same moment as a larrikin in the
gutter discharged a Chinese hunger alongside of
him.— Ensign.
Oscar Wilde up to date ;—“ What can
people possibly see to admire In liberty, and
freedom, and all that sort o: thing, as long as the
police permit them to take their walks abroad ?
One soon gets surfeited with freedom.”—“lf a
man could always see what was coming, he wouhl
be spared a number of absurd surprises.”—“No
man of tiste dreams of being true to Nature. She
is so old and passie.”— “ Wuen I feel devotional I
sing praises to the tailor (Taylor?) who raide me.”'
—“ One never takes kindly to bald facts. Even a.
Judge wears a wig.”—“Thoughts are like prettv-
women : if you get shut up alone with them in a,
railway-carriage they may want to give you
into custody.”—“Our sins never find us "out
if we can help it. We like to be always at.
home to our dearest friends.”—“ If a fellow must,
go in for^ prison life, he might as well be a chief
warder.”—“Really, one wouldn’t object to having
the Bible read to him if one could choose his
favorite chapters. I have found myself in sym-
pathy with the author at times.”—“Man poses,
Society deposes.”—“All children should insist
upon being born with a modern moral sense. My
moral sense is antique, the fashion of a bygone
age, and society considers it unbecoming. It is a
misfortune to be brought into the world hundreds
and thousands of years after your habits.”

HAVE MERCY ON THE HORES YOU RIDE
[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Where steers are wild and scrubs are thick,
And hidden melon-holes abound ;
Where mulga tracks are hard to pick,
And fallen timber lies around ;
Oh, stockman, in your reckless pride,
Have mercy on the horse you ride.
When nights are dark and skies are damp,
And camping-grounds are churned to slush,
And breaking from their quaking camp
The bellowing bulls unruly rush ;
When you would check their headlong tide
Oh, drover, spare the horse you ride.
Oh, wool-hawk, when the shed cuts out
And you forsake the shearers’ hut,
For months perhaps to ride about
Before you get another cut;
When grass is scarce and plains are wide,
Have mercy on the horse you ride.
Oh. mailman, plunging through the flood
With mailbags wet and creeks to swim,
Don’t flog your neddy through the mud,
But have a slight regard for him ;
And when he staggers in his stride,
Have mercy on the horse you ride.
When sultry are the summer days,
Wuen rooks are sharp and ruts are deep,
An 1 journeys lie through trackless ways
Where hilly roads grow rough and steep;
Wuen spurring up the mountain side,
Have mercy on the horse you ride.
Oh ! when the landlord has your cheque,
Think what a hopeless fool you are,
You poor, degraded, spineless wreck,
To jump your crock across the bar.
I’d rather dingoes gnawed his hide
Than shanties get the horse I ride.

Re early closing legislation for Adelaide.
The failure of the Vie. early closing enactment was
partly due to the veto of the municipalities, who
were allowed to regulate its operation. This
meant that the municipalities must be unanimous,
or the shops on on 3 side of the street would be
brought under the Act while those on the other side
of the street, being in another municipality, might
remain outside the Act. This occurred in several
instances, and the Act practically lapsed.
Mrs. Lance Rawson’s “ Australian Enquiry
Book” hasn’t any pretensions to literature, or even
to grammar ; but it is, for the Australian house-
wife, the most useful book of its kind yet issued
especially if she lives in the bush and has to set
her wits to work to replace the city shops. It
covers the whole range of handy bush lore, and
includes innumerable practical hints on cookery,
fancy-work, medicine, farming, skin curing, poul-
try-keeping, flower and fruit growing, and a host
of other things. The directions are splendidly
simple, and are seasoned throughout with a dash
of Kawson character which makes them abso-
lutely interesting.
G.H.J. : “ Port Phillip nowadays is al-
most as bleak and deserted as when only the
blacks owned it. Looking at the wide sea with-
out a sail or steamer’s smoke, at the Port pier
without a mast alongside, and at the vacant anchor-
ages, one comes to the conclusion that the only
way to save Victoria is this : —Let Melbourne be
abandoned, so that the scrub will overgrow every-
thing; let the whole whited sepulchre of boom
banks, empty shops, vacant chambers, lying news-
paper offices, revert to the original gum, ti-tree,
bracken, ’possum and bear. It would only take a
few years, for Nature hates a monstrosity; she
would soon bury it under her bush again, and,
perhaps, scatter a few wild-flowers over the suicide
city’s grave. Then, when the blackfellows had
made mia-mias under the last fallen pillar of
Government House, let some enterprising navi-
gator—Parkes, for choice—paddle up the Yarra
and discover the likely site for a village, as Bate-
man did ; and let it all be refounded and re-
incarnated, and a wiser and better start made all
over again.”
Half the countries of Europe have their
Paraguays, and Australia is, at the present time,
the Paraguay of most of them. Week after week
applications are made by Danes, Prussians, Nor-
wegians, Swedes and representatives of other
nationalities to their respective consuls for assis-
tance to carry them back to their native lands.
Sometimes the applicants are wholly destitute
and plead for the entire passage money. King
Oscar, of Sweden, when this Australian difficulty
was lately brought before him, said : “ Why do
they leave here? We have forests of timber,
mines of coal; there is work for all. I don’t say, go;
I say, stay; yet they fly to Australia and after-
wards demand that I pay their way back. I don’t
recognise any obligation to pay their way back.”
Notwithstanding the common-sense soundness of
this reasoning, however, King Oscar and other
potentates relax when judiciously pressed; and
individuals and families are regularly forwarded
“home” on satisfying the local consul that they
will, when in their own land, pay back by instal-
ments the expenses incurred, and on signing a
bond to that effect. There is no fund for the pur-
pose at “ home,” but there is a lot of good feeling
and broad human sympathy, which is a far better
ion vl exchequer than a Parliamentary “vote.”
Cremation looms near. Most of the Mel-
bourne corpse-carriers now style themselves, “ Un-

Comps, in Adelaide are growing very nervous.
In 1880, Disraeli predicted that he himself
would not live more than two years, and that his
“ friend and sovereign ” would last 20, Benjamin
died in 1881. The friend and sovereign has five
years more to run. According to Dizzy, Queen
Victoria will end with the century.
Tne working man never gives a shilling or half-a-crown

At Invercargill (M.L.) court, recently,
t vo unsuccessful suicides turned up in the dock ;
one had tried to saw himself asunder with a blunt
table-knife, because his wife was suspected of
mashing the other fellow, and the second one had
hanged himself in a futile fashion on the ground
of poverty and old age and the general absence of
any cheerful outlook. The court ordered the old
man to find one surety of .£25 that he would be of
good behaviour and not hang himself any more for
six months, and the other one was to
enter into his own recognisances in a similar
amount not to saw his throat again for
the same period. Which is amusing, if not instruc-
tive. When a man feels so bad that the prospects
of death, and extinction, or Gehenna or whatever
may come after, won’t keep him in this world, the
law falls back on the horrifying influences of his
own recognisances for a period of six months.
The patient may not care for the lake of fire, or
the worm that dieth not, or the devil and all the
rest of the paraphernalia, but his own recognis-
ances for a period of six months are calculated to
make him brace up and keep straight when every-
thing else fails. Nobody really knows the vast
resources of the law until he has entered into his
own recognisances for a period of six months.
Let the toiler bowed with labor in the trench,
And the sweated wretch who struggles for a
meal,
And the under-paid mechanic at his bench,
Know the scorn that all superior persons feel
For their callousness, their selfishness, and greed
Whilst their fellow-creatures hunger and endure.
Are they giving to their sister in her need ?
Do they share their surplus riches with the
poor?
For the weary woman striving in the night,
She whose nerveless fingers pluck the endless
thread,
Who has no surcease from sorrow, no respite,
Let no foolish tears of sympathy be shed.
She is hardened, like the rest, and what she earns
Goes her children’s bread and comfort to secure.
From the sufferings of poverty she turns,
And gives nothing of her fatness to the poor.
*Tis the man of means, the smug Conservative,
Who has built the fine asylums that we see,
Who has always got a silver coin to give
In the melting cause of blessed charity.
Ho a copper to a hungry man will throw,
And his help in any crying case is sure—
But his wage-sheet must be kept extremely low
To enable him to subsidise the poor.
In the Train.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The train stopped at some God-forgotten flag-
station, and she came in carrying a muffled-up
baby. She took the corner seat opposite me, next
to the gushing girl who was beguiling the journey
with pea nuts and a policeman. But policemen
and even pea-nuts were forgotten when this white-
faced, faded-pretty, girl-mother came in, her great
eyes heaving with grief and her weary arms hold-
ing her child to her breast. She wore some dark
dress that suggested crape, fitting close to her
girlish curves. A widow, probably—perhaps an
unmarried one? She sank wearily into the corner,
huddling the bundle of baby closer, while a curious
half-defiance looked out of her wide, wet-lashed
eyes, seeking no sympathy —even dreading it.
By-and-bye the gushing girl sidled up to the
new-comer and cooed coyly at the muffled child.
With a gesture of disgust, the mother turned
from her, as if to shield her child, bending back
into her corner. But the gusher was not easily
baulked. How old was the ickle darling?
Mightn’t she see its pretty wee face ? Did it
like pea-nuts?—didn’t it, then? And the hopeless
weariness showed in every line of the mother’s
white face. At last the gushing girl left her in
peace, and returned to her pea-nuts and her
policeman.
The train slouched on, as slowly and sullenly as
only narrow-gauge Maoriland trains dare ; and
silence settled down in the carriage. The girl-
mother had sunk limply to sleep—the drugged
sleep of weariness and misery. Her child had
slipped slowly from her weak arms and was pre-
cariously resting on her lap—sleeping, too. A
sudden jolt of the train almost threw the baby to
the floor ; but the mother did not stir. In an
instant the gushing girl was a woman. _ Without
waking the sleeper she clutched the tired little
heap of clothes, and took it to her breast with an
involuntary choking whisper in her voice, sooth-
ing it softly and lovingly. She slipped back the
shawl to look at it—such a white little face !
There was a shriek that filled the carriage, and
the girl stared at the child, holding it at arm’s
length, her horror almost thrusting it from her.
A moment later the mother leaped at her angrily
and snatched the child from her stiffened arms.
The girl sank back. “ Why, it’s dead /” she
gasped.
Then the only smile that had lit the mother’s
face flickered slowly aoross it. “ Yes,” she said,
“ she died yesterday, and I am taking her to be
buried.” And the rest was buried in a flood of
tears.
In Maoriland the conveyance of a corpse is
charged for at a shilling a mile.
