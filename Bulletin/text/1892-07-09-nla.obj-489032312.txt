DR. KELLY’S REPUTATION IS SO THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT IT WILL
ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
THE GREATER PORTION OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY FAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES. MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER,
ARE UNAWARE OP HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED FROM
ADVERTISING. HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OP HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS OP ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
DISTRICTS WHERE HIS REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOBS SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR. KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALL AS FOLLOWS
IP THERE IS A PERSON ON EARTH TO BE PITIED IT IS HE WHO IS OBLIGED
TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FELLOW BEINGS WHILE HIS MIND IS CONSTANTLY
HARASSED AND TORTURED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF
WHAT MUST INEVITABLY FOLLOW.
HE LOOKS HAGGARD AND SHEEPISH. HE IS NERVOUS IN PUBLIC, AND EXTREMELY
GIRLISH AND BACKWARD IN LADIES’ SOCIETY. THE VICTIM OF THIS, THE MOST
DANGEROUS OP ALL VICES, IP NOT RELIEVED, SOON REACHES A STATE WHICH MUST
END IN LIFE-LONG MISERY. HE MUST ULTIMATELY SINK TO THE LOWEST STAGE
OP DEGRADATION AND SHAME. DR. KELLY MAINTAINS THAT THE PHYSICIAN WHO
HAS THE POWER TO CURE, AND REMAINS SILENT, IS GUILTY OF AN UNPARDONABLE
SIN OP OMISSION. PERSONS WHO READ HIS GREAT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILL
BE SHOWN THE INEVITABLE RESULT OP THE BAD HABITS, AND IN MOST
INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO SEE THEIE FOLLY
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OP THEM. THE BOOK WILL ALSO
SHOW THEM CLEARLY
HOW TO CURE THE DISEASE WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE.
DR KELLY’S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE.
THEREFORE, EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE PROM DISEASE, SEND FOR THIS GREAT
MEDICAL WORK, THAT YOU MAY BE ENABLED TO ADVISE OTHERS AFTER PERUSING
ITS PAGES. VERY FREQUENTLY THIS MAY BE DONE BEFORE ANY GREAT HAEM
HAS TAKEN PLACE.

THIS PAPER SHOULD BE MENTIONED WHEN WRITING.
“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at Sydney, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia's Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper iqhich has a consistent an! dii
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians. —The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System- one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole_
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility.”
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
asu has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin's inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily papa-
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they arc printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushraan of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-slieller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

SATURDAY, JULY 9, 1892.
The British Elections.
The British Conservative Parliament has
died of old age and chronic uselessness, and
the two ancient parties —Avhich never did
any particular good save to keep each other
out of office, and which never did any
particular harm save that Avhich is embodied
in the fact that they never are both out at
the same time—have arisen to save their
bleeding country once more. Also, three
subordinate parties—making five in all—arc
pervading the land, and great is the con-
fusion thereof. In the first place, there is
the venerable Conservative faction the
stupid faction Avith the huge stomach—The
great hereditary landlords avlio support the
Constitution, Avhatever that may be, and
tlie aristocracy, and the Roj 7 al Family, and
the Coercion laws in Ireland, and the State
Church, and avlio never did any single act
in the Avay of progress except Avhea they
Avere'dragged into it by the relentless force
of circumstances. Attached to them is the
Unionist section Avhich calls itself Liberal
and votes Avith the Conservatives—a poor
little mongrel organisation of no particular
account, headed by a renegade screw-maker
and a duke, and obviously doomed to extinc-
tion. These two parties represent the
element Avhich wants to do nothing except
to maintain the Throne and collect its
rents regularly, and Avhich fancies that the
Avorld can be made to stand still provided
the House of Commons passes a Bill
to that effect. Third on the list is
the old Liberal party Avhich, like the
Conservative one, never progresses unless it
is dragged along by exterior influences, and
Avhich is called Liberal merely because it
doesn’t require to be dragged quite so hard
as its rival. After this comes the Irish
Parnellite party, which Avants freedom for
Ireland, but is prepared to sacrifice it, if
necessary, because of its reverence for a
dead man’s tombstone ; and, last of all, there
is the Irish M‘Carthyite party, Avhich also
Avants freedom for Ireland, but is also pre-
pared to sacrifice it, if needful, because of
its want of reverence for the tombstone afore-
said. And, as for the party which Avishes to
prevent tlie accumulation of huge fortunes
and the consequent impoverishment of the
masses—which desires to tax the big land-
lords, and burst up the big estates, and
shorten the hours of tlie overburdened
worker, by Act of Parliament if necessary,
and to wipe out sweating, and stop the
ruinous influx of foreign paupers and foreign
shoddy, it has not yet been heard of at all
in British politics.
* * *
Tlie old snnfilebusters of Britain have
always thrown in their lot with the Tory
faction, while the new snuflflebusters will
probably give a tolerably unanimous support
to the Liberals. The former comprise the
Established Church, which collects its tithes
from the beggared farmers by moans of
bailiffs and police, and seizes the hist pig
from the ruined agriculturist in the name
of the great Reformer of Nazareth.
The latter include all the Nonconformist
bodies, and their apostle is Stead and their
ablest political organ the Review of
Reviews. The Old Snuffle revolves around
Queen Victoria, and its great axiom is that
she rules by Divine right, and has been en-
dowed by Providence with more than human
virtues ; the New Snuffle has no such well-
defined centre, but exhibits a marked
tendency to whitewash the Prince of Wales.
Both of them preach that Discontent is
sinful above all things, and that the famished
and rag-chid millions who sleep on broken
floors and under leaky roofs, and live in the
odour of sewer-gas, and are ignorant, and
frozen, and unspeakably poor, and without
hope either in this world or the next, should
be calm and resigned and should put their
trust in the Lord. They both denounce
Socialism as a wicked flying in the face of
Providence, and revolution as a thing that is
born of Anti-CnniST, and their remedy for
the indescribable misery of outcast England
is always prayer, which is never answered,
and faith, which is the art of believing in
things which we know are not and cannot
be true. Conjointly they represent that
enormously powerful influence, the pious
drivel of England—a multitudinous, black-
coated, black-hatted incubus —a vast mass of
“respectable’’greasy, shop-keeping humanity
which is impervious to sorrow at home, but
is always ready to shed copious tears over a
dead ass in Central Africa, ora happy nigger
who hasn’t been blessed with rum and
Scripture on some coral island among the
South Seas.

The politicians of England, like its
churches, are stereotyped and petrified, and,
so far as concerns the great social problem of
chronic poverty and woe, there is no hope in
them. Gladstone is, at the present time,
tlie most advanced by far among the leading
statesmen of the country, but except with
regard to the one question of Irish autonomy,
he is slow and bigoted and incurably Con-
servative. In Australia he would be regarded
as a left-off curiosity of the dark ages of
politics, and when England calls him an
enlightened Liberal it is a woeful commen-
tary on English Liberalism, He is rigidly
opposed to the compulsory eight - hours
system, because it would bo an interference
with “individual liberty”—which means
the liberty of the employer to work his em-
ploye sixteen hours a day if he wants to, and
the glorious freedom of the employe to
accept these terms if he feels so inclined or
else to starve. He is equally opposed to the
enforcement by law of a ten or twelve or a
fourteen hours’ system for exactly the same
reasons—they are all an interference with
individual liberty. Even a sixteen-hour
system, according to the Gladstonian philo-
sophy, is injurious to freedom, for the
employers who want to exact seventeen
hours work—and they are not a few— would
thereby be subjected to a bloated tyranny,
and Socialism would begin to make inroads
upon that indefinite thing called the Constitu-
tion. The idea of imposingaland-taxandcom-
pelling the British landholder to bear even the
same proportion of the national burdens as
any other man is too utterly and horribly
sacrilegious ever to have dawned upon
Gladstone’s intelligence. Ho is an ardent
supporter of the Established Church which
exacts £8,000,000 annually from the hungry
nation by force and fraud and snuffle, and
legal violence. If any one were to suggest
that England should shut its gates against the
ceaseless inroad of foreign paupers who are
steadily reducing wages to starvation level,
or propose the adoption of tlie French law
of inheritance so that the huge estates and
huge fortunes which overshadow the country
might be gradually dissipated among the
mass of the people, he would probably civil
out the troops under the impression that a
revolution had begun. And even a proposal
to stop the destruction of agriculture and
the eviction of the agricultural population in
order to create deer-forests and grouse moors
would make his aged hair and his huge shirt-
collar stand upon end with horror.
* # *
The one gleam of Liberalism in all Glad-
stone’s policy is his desire to grant
autonomy to Ireland, and so far as is known
his scheme is so hedged in with petty
restrictions and reservations as to be little
better than a shadow. And beyond that he
is simply an advocate of tlie horrors and the
crimes of liberty—the liberty ot every man
to do wrong if he has the power, and to seize
his neighbour's substance if he finds tlie
chance, and to grind the faces of the poor
whenever the opportunity presents itself.
And one-half the British Parliament follows
him cautiously and reluctantly, as an able
but revolutionary old man who is worthy of
support but must not be supported too reck-
lessly ; while the other half regards him as a
wild, mad, unscrupulous iconoclast who
ought to be abolished, lest he should drag
England into anarchy and ruin. There is
not in all Gladstone’s policy one gleam of
genuine sympathy with the starving, hope-
less, wretched, sorrow - stricken masses of
England. Be is merely an able and eloquent
political machine, a deeply sincere snufiler
over forms and ceremonies and creeds, one
more among that great crowd who urge the
poor and the homeless to trust in Providence
—and be “loft.” When Stead on a recent
occasion asked him what he considered to bo
the greatest hope for the future in England
his answer was worthy of the British poli-
tician—such an answer as is eminently calcu-
lated to bring comfort to a sorrowing
nation
I should say ive must look for that to the maintenance
of faith in the Invisible. That is the great hope of tlie
future ; it is ttic mainstay of civilisation. And lay that I
mean a living faith in n personal God. Ido not hold with
“ streams of tendency.” After CO years of public life I
hold more strongly than over to this comiction, deepened
and strengthened by long experience, of the reality, and
the nearness, and the personality of God.
Yet Gladstone, despite his bigotry, his
Conservatism, and his shufflings, is by far
the most advanced among the leading states-
men of England. He is all but useless to
the cause of progress, yet he is better than
his compeers because they are useless alto-
gether.

The attempt to form a powerful fifth party
in the interests of Labour is for the time fore-
doomed to failure. Only men of independent
means can sit in the British Parliament
under the present system ; the country is
owned by the caucuses of the two leading
parties, and for the candidate who is not
nominated by cither of them there is hardly
one chance in a hundred ; the workmen who
attempt to organise a party of their own are
liable to be boycotted and starved by the
organisations of capital; and even though
the House of Commons could be conquered
by the Labour-party the Lords are still in
the way and can be shifted only by terrorism
or revolution. And—the worst disability of
all—both the Old Snuffle and the-New are
against the Labour organisations, on the
theory that the masses should stick to the
old parties and trust entirely to the Lord
for deliverance from their own personal
troubles. And betwixt the twin powers of
snuffle and the caucuses the chances of the
people arc not bright. The coming struggle
lies between two dead men, and it is only a
question which corpse will win. The fight
is between the dead Parnell as representing
Irish autonomy, and the dead William of
Orange as the emblem of Irish subjection,
and tlie probabilities arc in favour of the
former as being the fresher dead man of the
two, and one who is worth more dead than
the other was when alive. But there is
nothing in the programme of the one
deceased or the other which promises
to relieve, in the slightest degree, the suffer-
ings of a nation which is oppressed by the
twofold evils of landlordism and capitalism.
* # *
Still, dark as the horizon may be, it is
brighter than it has ever been before. The
Labour-party in the new Parliament will be
exceedingly small beyond a doubt, yet
the chances arc that the nucleus of a party
will be formed. Tlie Liberal Unionists are,
to all appearance, dead, and the shattered
fragment that remains after the election will
probably unite with the Tories and have a
separate existence no longer. Home Rule
will bo accomplished sooner or later, and
when it is accomplished the Kilkenny cats
who are now howling over the great
Parnell’s dust will remove to College
Green, and the House of Commons will
fall back into something approaching its
ancient position. Then the Labour members
may form the Third Party in the House,
and if they can only find a leader half
as able, dauntless and enduring as the
noble Irish patriot who was howled to
death by the prurient apostles of the New
Snuffle in England, they can make the House
of Commons a hell as ho did, until some
future Premier undergoes another sudden
conversion even as Gladstone did on
the subject of Ireland. And after they
have been jeered by the dreary comic
prints, and gaoled for sedition and attempted
revolution, and howled down by the high-
born “gentlemen” of the Commons, and
cursed, and excommunicated, and suspended,
and expelled, then some Liberal leader of
the future will adopt their programme under
compulsion, and stump the country with it
until he achieves a triumph. For in England
everything comes to him who waits and
remorselessly stonewalls the Legislature from
one year’s end to the other, and oven the
mighty influence of the national snuffle gives
way to him in the end.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Camel Problem.
“ Unionist ” Avrites to The Bulletin as follows
from Bourke (N.S.W.) re an alleged camol-
shooting case in that district :
As the Camel-question is one of very great importance
to the inhabitants in this district, and as Tim Bulletin
—(&c., &c. —marmalade omitted. —Ed. B.) —I sei d yon tlie
enclosed report of a police-court case, being of the opinion
that yon would he able to make use of part of it. Know-
ing tiiat your sympathies are with the workers, and as the
introduction of camels and Afghans is worse than the
introduction of Chinese to the masses, especially in this
district, I enclose the cutting for you to make use of or
otherwise.
There is a hopeless conservatism about this
effusion that is depressing to contemplate. The
Australian bush man is seemingly so wedded to
his horse and his bullock-dray that he is re-
solved to have no improvement, and—presum-
ably in his interests—a bill was even introduced
into Parliament last session to restrict the use
of the only animal that is capable of doing good
service on the hungry, sun-stricken, waterless
plains of the interior. There is no earthly reason
why the Afghan and the camel should go together;
the Australian has at least as much intelligence
as that imported Asiatic, and he knows enough
to make use of the “ship of the desert ” with-
out hiring any cheap Mohammedan to help him.
Put, apparently, he never dreams of making
the attempt, and because the Afghan is another
cheap labour curse in a land where such curses
are already much too plentiful, therefore he
wants to abolish him and his animal together.
The idea of abolishing the man and not the
animal has not yet, so far as we are aware,
been proposed by anybody. Unless Providence
will send rivers through all the dry lands of
Australia, or endow the horse with the capacity
of travelling for four days under a burning sun
without water, and carrying 4001bs. on its back,
and living, when necessary, upon anything that
bears the slightest semblance to vegetation, and
can make that animal live for 40 years, the
camel has come to stay in this country, and of
the two animals the horse could, in the waterless
interior, be better spared. If the Australian is
too conservative to learn the use of the humped
monstrosity, then the Afghan driver will stay ;
otherwise he can go. The individual who wants
to abolisli camels because the first of their kind
was driven by cheap Asiatics is capable of
abolishing the bullock to get rid of some occa-
sional Chinese bullock-driver, or tearing up the
railways in order to secure the abolition of
imported railway commissioners.

Tlie “ National Ass ’’—Again!
The bogus-National Association of New South
Wales last week sent out this private circular
among the Sydney amateur athletes and mem-
bers of athletic societies :
Dear Sir,-Owing to indifference, or for some oilier
reason, the younger men of this colony have not hitherto
taken that part in its public affairs which was warranted
by their numbers and influence,; and it has been thought
well to invite the representatives of the various rowing,
football, cricket, cycling, and kindred bodies to meet
together informally for the purpose of talking over the
position of affairs, with a view to obtaining the co-opera-
tion of the members of their clubs in all matters relating
to the public welfare. A preliminary smoke-meeting,
which you are cordially invited to attend, will be held on
Saturday evening next, July 2 (at 8 o’clock, in the front
room upstairs at the Sydney Catering Co.’s premises
(Gunsler’s), 175 Pitt-sireet), and it is hoped, that you will
make it convenient to attend and secure the attendance
of any of youi friends who are likely to he interested.
Yours, faithfully,
(Signed)
Most. Arnold, A. Consett Stephen, T. 11. Fairland,
A. C. Ebswoutii, E. P. Simpson, William Cope, 11. Y.
Braddox, Adrian Knox, W. 11. German, George Merri
vale.
William Epps, Secretary.
The meeting duly came off and was attended
by about 20 people. The irrepressible Mr.
“Billy” Cope was elected to the chair, and
had carefully taken off his braces and left his
waistcoat unbuttoned to give a free-and-easy
tone to things A section of the meeting were
Randwick footballers who bad just achieved an
unexpected victory over Strathfield, and
they were “ ge-lorious.” They assiduously
punished the liquor which the National
Ass was fool enough to provide, applauded every-
body, and drank success to everything.
The notion of mixing up football and Freetrade,
pedestrianism and Protection, is one which
would only occur to an inspired idiot, but the
National Ass has a purpose to serve, and hopes
to use the footballers, &c., as tools to effect
that purpose. It imagines that if it softsawders
the athletic bodies they will roll up at Free-
trade meetings and act as cheap chuckers-out
(ft la the pugs, at the celebrated packed Sydney
Jubilee-gathering) and do the dirty work for
the Association generally. “We want your
assistance,” whined Secretary Epps to the
meeting the oilier night. “ For what object
do you want our assistance?” lie was asked,
but no satisfactory reply was forthcoming. The
promoters were frightened to come right out
with the truth and say what they wanted.
They pretended that they were actuated solely
by a desire to. awaken interest in politics, and
they had the effrontery to state that their asso-
ciation did not take any political side. The
platform of the association is to oppose “ One-
man-one-vote,” and if that is not taking a side
in politics, then there is no such thing as taking
a side. Everyone knows well enough that the
National Ass is a capitalistic association
—the names on its circulars prove it.
Can the footballers and others believe that the
men belonging to the National Association are
spending money, and hiring rooms, and sending
out circulars, and paying for drinks, simply
from a philanthropic desire to see young men
vote? Do the names of the National Associa-
tion look like that class of men? “No fear.”
The thing is simply a sickly attempt to run in
the athletic bodies to act as “ barrackers ” for
the white waistcoat party.
*. .
An Impending Uproar.
A shriek of indignation will presently come
over the sea from London, when the “home”
shareholders who have met the calls made by
certain Melbourne banks (in liquidation) learn
how their Australian brethren skip over the
difficulty. One after another the damaged
capitalists of Marvellous M. are dodging their
liabilities in the calm, respectable manner
peculiar to land-boom morality. Instead of
wearing their schedules on the sleeve as an
outward visible sign that they have “ taken
the knock,” these people seem to go bung on an
inward spiritual system, whereby they are
enabled to keep a veneer of dignity unspotted
before the world, whilst they get there all the
Same. The head and front of a big commercial
firm is said to have opened a private meeting of
his own particular creditors with prayer, pre-
vious to arranging a small composition, which
will entitle him to escape from his calls with a
loss of so-muc',i in the £. That a recently
almighty financier has paid 5 per cent, on h s
most pressing liabilities, and gone silently away
in the track of Matthew Davies, is pretty
generally understo xl. The fact that a high-toned


speculator squared his circle with a half-dollar
dividend seems to be common property. Mis-
fortune falls very lightly upon the representa-
tive city “ gent.” or influential bubble-ldower in
this part of the world. The struggling trades-
man who, considering that when luck goes
against him he must take the consequences,
sells himself up and divides all his goods
amongst the poor creditors, has to stand aside
in C'ollins-street and let the “ friendly composi-
tion ” potentate go by, for the latter takes the
middle of the pavement as boldly as ever and
treads down the humble citizens in his path.
This state of things may meet ■ with local
approval, but when it ceases to be a matter of
purely Australian interest the trouble is bound
to come. If a Londoner and a Melbournite are
supposed to be pulling in the same losing boat,
a nd the cockney who plys his sculls finds that
his comrade has quietly slunk out of the job
and swum to shore—well, the affair must surely
eventuate in a row.
———
The Broken Hill Strike.
This week there has been signed what—Jo all
appearance —is the death-warrant of the great
Broken Hill mining corporation. For many
weeks past there have been rumours of impend-
ing trouble at Broken Hill. The huge mine
has, judging by results, always been worked on
“the pig-rooting” principle, with the one
object of getting out the richest ore first,
and getting it out anyhow, at the risk of
the lives of everybody concerned save the
board of directors. There has been a horrible
lack of engineering skill in the management of
things, and the workings are perpetually on the
verge of collapse, and the workers underground
dig out the company’s dividends at constant
risk of entombment. These dividends have been
enormous ; the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. re-
Eays its original capital regularly every six weeks,
ut the shares have been artificially “boosted” on
the stock exchange to such a height that the
buyer at present prices receives a very small
percentage upon his outlay. Therefore, the
capitalistic press points to this small percentage
as a proof that the mine is ruined by the
exorbitant demands of the employes, and that
wages must be reduced in order that the suffer-
ing proprietors may receive a reasonable return
for their money. There is a general feeling
that 860 per cent, profit is insufficient, and a
longing to enhance these returns by any possible
means. The Broken Hill Proprietary. Co.
has got what is practically a perpetual lease of
the richest ore deposits in Australia at an
infinitesimal rent. It pays larger salaries to
its directors and other high officials than any
other company of its kind in this continent,'
and it pays the lowest wages to its workmen.
Rents are high at Broken Hill, the cost of
living is enormous, the town is woefully
unhealthy, and the miners suffer much from
that horrible complaint known as lead-poison-
ing, and in return for all these disabilities their
pay has been reduced far below the accustomed
Australian standard. And in addition to all
these troubles the Proprietary,Co.—not satisfied
with its profits of £1,000,000 per annum or
thereabouts —recently gave notice that it in-
tended to break its agreement with the men—
the agreement that was solemnly ratified
by both parties in 1890 —and run the
mine by the contract, free competition
system, letting the work out in instal-
ments to the cheapest sweater who might
come along and leaving him to make his profits
in the good old way of the sweating system in
general. The miners I'equested a conference
upon the subject, and being unable to obtain a
definite answer they decided to refuse the terms
and leave off work, and now if the mine wants
to cave in, it must cave. On this subject the
Sydney Daily Telegraph —that hypocritical
organ which is always ready to advocate Land
Nationalisation, or the millennium, or any far-
off reform which it believes will never be
realised, and which always denounces any
reform that seems in danger of coming to pass
—states the case in the interests of Property as
follows
For some time past the state of the Proprietary mine,
in which the bulk of the men are employed, has been
such as to occasion grave fears for its safety'. The timbers
have been subjected to a tremendous strain, and it is only
by the most strenuous exertions that a ruinous collapse
has been so far prevented. The danger of this disaster is
regarded as still serious, and unless the work of
strengthening the supports is pushed on property to the
extent of millions may be destroyed in as many moments.
This difficulty is ccn ileredto be Labour’s opportunity,
n the men were to continue at work until the term of
notice has expired the mine would be secure, but by
rushing out now at a minute’s warning it will be left to its
I»te. Such at least is their expectation, and it is with the
avowed purpose of threatening the shareholders with
tms wreck and ruin that the present action is
taken. if the mine falls in it may suspend
•he production of millions of pounds’ worth of
silver per annum for many a day to come, and entail
untold expenditure of money as well, hut they feel no
compunction about that. One savagely selfish view is
that if the mine falls in there will he so much work to do
m re-opening it before silver production can be resumed.
Had the companies anticipated that anything like such a
an( i cruel method of fighting would be resorted to,
au they need have done was give no notice until the mine
(act been made secure. Believing that they were dealing
"ith mm under rational guidance, however, they adopted
a candid and open course, with this result. Should the
uen persevere in their despicable action they will render
~ °i Labour in Australia odious throughout the
' msed world. A parallel case would he that of a ship’s
rew which advisedly chose as its occasion for proclaiming
breakers 6 me vvhen *-5e vessel was drifting on to the
Evidently the D.T. put, its best perverter on
ie job in this instance, but his garbled story
is exceedingly clumsy. The men left work
when they received notice of a further rcduc-
lon m their already much-reduced wages, and
| the company chose to declare war just when
s mine was falling in, that was the company’s
"n funeral. The captain who breaks ids

a direct burden on B and C, who reluctantly
are compelled to support him, or A supplies B

to his diminished income is forthwith compelled
to reduce his consumption of B and C’s goods
unless these latter are also agreeable to accept a
reduction in their costs of production and
charge only 7s, lid. each for their goods like-
wise. The indirect advantages of Protection
are a bit above the feeble Freetrade intellect.
Cable item from Britain :
At the Chambers of Commerce Congress this afternoon
Mr. Nealey moved the resolution standing in his name,
recommending the self-governing colonies of the British
Empire to adopt a policy of freetrade. In speaking to
the question he declared that the continuance of protec-
tion would have the effect of destroyin': the commercial
treaties between Great Britain and Belgium and Germany.
Foreign nations would adopt measures of retaliation in
respect to colonial raw materials. It was quite possible
to make the ports of all the colonies duty free to foreign
goods, but it was a matter of impossibility to convert
England to a protectionist country.
The calm self-sufficiency of the blatant Briton
never shone out more conspicuously than in
that little item. It would be quite possible to
make “all the colonies” freetrade because
it would be—haw—convenient to Britain
that they should be so, and Nealey
evidently feels that when these “colonies”
hear that Britain’s commercial treaties
are in danger they will fall over each other in
their efforts to sacrifice themselves for her
benefit. And Nealey would probably be an
astonished Briton if he were told that the
“colonies” are at present engaged in looking
after their own interests, and they didn’t even
know that Britain had commercial treaties with
Belgium and Germany ; and if these treaties are
so fixed that they require Australia to go back
to Freetrade, then they had better be refixed
on a new basis forthwith. And as regards
Nealey’s recommendation that “ the self-
governing colonies adopt a policy of Freetrade ”
the said “colonies ” hereby return the kindness
by recommending Britain to adopt Protection
and to abolish the Queen and the House of
Lords, for if she doesn’t she may seriously
injure our relations with Honolulu or some
place, and then this country will feel aggra-
vated.
In the Days of the Lash and the
Darbies.
To uplift the honour, glory, and credit of the
mother-province, the N.S. W. Government is now
actively engaged in carrying on the patriotic work
of holding up the mirror to convict nature —a
work initiated some years ago by The Bulletin
in its “ History of Botany Bay,” and subsequently
continued in “Tales of the System.” 'To give
vraisemblanee to a consistently lurid narrative, to
throw also into high relief his own actions in regard
to convietism, and to deepen the artistic gloom
from which he claims to have rescued this God-
benisoned territory, Sir Henry Farkes has taken
keen and artistic interest in the publication of
the “ History of New South Wales from the
Records,” with all the shadows thrown on such
history by the historic hulks and the primeval
gallows ; and now we have the records themselves
—and very edifying reading they make, indeed.
Some years ago the first volume of the “His-
tory of New South Wales” was issued to an
expectant public ; and all things considered it
fell little short of the expectations formed of it.
Noiv we have from Mr. Alex. Bntton the “Records”
upon which Mr. Barton’s volume was founded.
It is called part 2of volume I. The volume
in question, or part of a volume, as it pleases the
authorities to term it, is the Exodus of convietism
with a small section of its Deuteronomy. It is
luridly interesting. Here we have the skeleton,
the iilans and specifications of the gibbet ;
the abstract ethics of the “ system,” in all
their naked, brutal and unadulterated simplicity.
Here are the short and simple annals of the six
marines hanged for a paltry theft of provisions in
days of cruel privation ; we are naively told
that “Seven of them were concerned, but one of
them turned King’s evidence and saved his neck —
he was the greatest villain and first projector of
the scheme.” In 1790 a “ woman ” was judicially
strangled at Norfolk Island for robbery ; and
there are other hangings recorded in the book,
which need not here be chronicled. However,
hanging was too lovely and idyllic a death to
please the gentle Phillip (to whom, by the
orders of Sir Henry Farkes, an expensive
statue is being erected out of the revenue of
the province). He considered that death itself
was not enough, and that the criminal should be
confined “ till an opportunity offered of delivering
him as a prisoner to the natives of Maoriland —
and let them eat him.
* * *
The mortality-bills are interesting. Thirty-six
men and four women prisoners died on the passage
out of the First Fleet. Up to the 9th of July of
the same year (1788) 20 men and 8 women had
shuffled off their convict coil ; 11 men and 1
woman had absconded, 4 bad been executed, and
3 had been killed by the natives. Up to the end
of September Collins registers the death-rate as
100, exclusive of abscondmeuts and executions.
During the passage out the Lady Juliana lost only
7 women ; but the Second Fleet was the floating
altar of a perfect holocaust. “Of the 930 males
sent out by the last ship,” writes Governor Phillip,
“ 201 died on board, and 50 have died since land-
ing. The number of sick this day (17th June,
1790) is 45(Q and many who are not reckoned as
sick have barely strength to attend to themselves.
Such is our present state, and when the last ships
arrived we had not 00 people sick in the colony.”
King writes from the Cape of Good Hope in
July, 1792, and registers the deaths on board the
Active and three or four other transports as 39.
On board the Pitt 49 persons died of fever and
scurvy, and 120 of the convicts were sick when
landed. In March 1792, Phillip wrote ; “ I am
very sorry to say that most of the convicts who
were received by the last ships still continue in

A letter from Major Hess to Governor Phillip,
dated from Norfolk Island, reads quaintly enough.
The gallant Lieutenant-Governor growls irritably
because “confinement, with corporal punishment,
was all ” he was authorised to inflict as a punish-
ment for common “and garden” theft, as the
wicked and abandoned wretches plundered the vege-
table patches of the settlement almost without fear
when they knew they could not then be hanged
for it. King subsequently complains of his incom-
peteney to inflict severe punishments, and there
seems to have been an unspeakable yearning in
the official mind of the day to put human backs
and human necks (when belonging to convicts) to
the only useful purpose that God ordained them
for, viz., to be scored and scarred over with the
cat-o’-nine-tails in the first instance and to be
stretched by hemp in thfe second. There is a vast
amount of information in the present volume con-
cerning convicts, rations, discipline, punishment,
executions, leg-irons, gaol gangs and town
gangs, absconders, floggings, hangings, mutinies,
mortality on convict transports, shortage
of provisions, criminal mortality, condition
of the hulks, quarrels between the Governor
and the military, court-martials, convict-bar-
racks, the N.S. Wales Corps, outlawry,
thefts of boats, drownings, wrecks, floating
prisons, overcrowded transports, details respect-
ing the three Elects, and all sorts of transporta-
tion and convict statistics and penitentiary
theories, military establishments, derelictions of
marines, pirates, inland discoveries, and what-not.
The collection begins August, 1783, and ends
December, 1792, when Governor Phillip left Lag-
land for England, its mother. The whole period
covered is nine years and four months, during the
first three years of which proposals and sugges-
tions of convict colonisation were under considera-
tion, eight months were occupied in making pre-
parations for the departure of the First Fleet of
transports ; the voyage took up another eight
months ; and the remainder of the time, rather
more than five years, was devoted to hanging,
flogging, starving, and otherwise “ disciplining ”
the outcast mob of pickpockets and rabbit-
snarers and other small sinners of the dear old
mother-country. Those who outlived the rigours
of this period of probation founded the first
families of New South Wales, and their descen-
dants now run the province, so far as they
are able, on the lines laid down by
their great-grandfathers’ oppressors. The docu-
ments cover much ground. Matra, Young
and Banks are each represented in their separate
and special proposals relating to convict settle-
ment. Bligh receives a deal of notice in connec-
tion with the Bounty mutiny. The exploration of
the province in the very first days of settlement,
the voyaging of the Government craft about the
coasts, the squabbles between the officials, the
lies the different heads of departments told about
each other and the lies outsiders told about both
-have all here fair and unbiassed representation.
The volume is too vasty for exhaustive notice, but
it is unique, entertaining and provocative of high-
class cynicism. It throws an eager search-light
into the revered gloom of a historic period ; and
it is well worth the price of publication, whatever
that is. It is well bound, well-printed, admirably
“read,” and it reflects great credit upon all con-
cerned in its production. It has one glaring fault,
however. The index is not a triumph of any kind
whatever, and the value of a historical work of
such multifariousness as the one in question is
seriously discounted unless anyone interested can
readily and immediately discover what he is
looking for. With this hint for the conduct of
future volumes of “ Historical Kecords of New-
South Wales” we take our leave of the latest
collection of Convict Memoirs issued by the press.
Poe got £2 for “ The Raven.”

The man, Cream, accused of poisoning
girls in London with a view to getting “hush-
money ” from people who never gave orders to
that effect, already looks like a “goner.” On the
face of it he’s a new thing in lunatics, but the law
will make cold Cream of him all the same.
All the old Melbourne identities are
quitting their billets. Captain Eullarton, a
potentate of 30 years’ standing in the Vie. Naval
Brigade service, took a formal leave of his gallant
seamen one night last week. The capting ex-
pressed a hope that they would continue to scare
away the foe as vigorously as ever, and the heroes
shouted “ay, ay, Sir !” or words to that effect,
with true comic-opera enthusiasm.
Dear Bulletin, —Before the amalgamation
of the legal professions in Victoria, a barrister
was—for what reason nobody knows—supposed to
be the only person competent to draw pleadings
in an action. For instance, in an action for
simple recovery of money for goods sold, after writ
has been issued, appearance entered, and state-
ment, setting forth fully the grounds of claim, has
been filed by the plaintiff, the defendant has to
reply. This reply is almost invariably as follows :
“ The defendant denies that lie is indebted as
alleged.” These nine words cause the following
items to appear in the defendant’s solicitor’s bill
of costs :
£ s. cl.
Instructions for defence to statement of claim .. 0 S
Drawing aqd engrossing instructions to counsel
to draw same C fos. .. .. .. 12 0

Engrossing same .. .. .. .. 2 0

This item alone costing £4 12 10
Now, why on earth could not the solicitor run off
this little formula himself and charge his client,
say, half-a-sovereign, which would bo adequate
remuneration? Also, is the same state of things
to continue under amalgamation, and is one
amalgam to employ another at his client’s expense
tod) the work which lie is employed to do him-
self ? In the event of a person employing a
solicitor, should not that solicitor do all the neces-
sary work fur his client, and if he himself is nob
competent-as he should be--to write the afore-
said nine words at over a shilling apiece and sends
them on to someone else to write—should- not the
solicitor himself be forced by rules of court to pay
for the wot k ? Bmilkil

81C Macquavie-street North, Sydney, July 6,1592.
My Dkar Moorabinda, —
The annual ball in aid of the well-managed School of
Industry was a greater success this year than last, when—
as every butterfly remembers—only a couple of hundred
people turned up. At the plain and fancy dress ball in
•Centennial Hall on 29th ult., there must have been thou-
sands present—but I am not skilful at counting crowds,
especially when some of their ingredients come out in two
half-suits of clothes, and, consequently, look like two
people instead of one. Which greatly adds to the nume-
j ical difficulty of the case - especially after supper.
Wigs, paint (plenty of it, daubed on openly, as is per-
missible at costume balls, and don’t the women make the
most of it !) and powder, transformed folks, so that “ Is it
Mrs.’Arris?” was heard on every side, and the diffident
people in or’nery dress were quite a rest after one had
been “guessing again” in front of masked individuals,
with scaly paws and tails, and all sorts of horrors. But
the fancy dresses were the most interesting—especially
w hen the wearer wisely refrained from revealing too much
«'f her scaffolding, so to speak. Only an actress can wear
u knee-cap skirtette and look pleased and happy at the
same time. When a private person, in a burst of Dutch
courage at her dressmaker’s, orders too many tucks in her
hilt, she becomes a prey to burning embarrassment from
the moment she steps on to the floor. And bending
forward—the usual trick of the woman who is conscious
of too much ankle—isn’t the slightest use, for what you
gain in length in front, you lose very pointedly in the
roar.
I didn’t see any prettiest costumes, because they were
mostly very well done, except that some of the wigs sat
gingerly on misfit crania, and appeared as if combed out
with a rake. Miss Simpson was very thoroughly got up
i i “ stars and stripes”; Miss Isabel Osborne’s gipsy dress
was carried out to walnut-juice lengths ;Miss L. Osborne’s
“Haymaker” dress became her to the last tooth in her
rake; Miss Marcia Cox was well disguised as “Pink
Domino Dr. Arthur Cox, “ Black Domino Mr. A. W_
Nathan wore diamond buckles on his “David Garrick”
fchoes. There was a Devil hailing from Gunnedah, and
somebody (a S3*dney surveyor, who, by some means, was
credited with being identical with the brother of a well-
J.nown athletic solicitor) was really funny as an old Roman
coryphee—scarlet tights and yellow gauze skirts, but he
wouldn’t take off his top-wrap, and there isn’t much fun
about the outer aspect of an overcoat that I can see. Sir
John Falstaff spoilt a correct get-up by omitting to pad
his paunch ; and Mons. Marius and Otho Stuart turned up
in evening dress. They’re so tired of the “ other thing ”
1 hat no doubt a plain boiled shirt and swallow-tail are a
perfect joy to them.
Powdered hair was very general among the ladies who
weren’t in costume. Mrs. Burdskin, in black merv. with
lilac bodice and diamond necklet, wore her hair powdered;
so did Miss Burdekin, in black lace with trimming round
the corsage of pink unmounted roses. Miss Amy Roberts
looked well in cream brocade and lace; Mrs. Bloomer
wore a dainty confection of sea-blue armure royale and
chiffon, diamond ornaments ; Mrs. J. R. Fairfax combined
dark-grey and slate-grey brocade. And soon. Floor and
music were lively, but the “costume sets” were spoilt
by the whole ball joining in. The Shakespearean set,
however, kept sui generis —and let me add in conclusion
that the eleven o’clock supper was a worthy effort
decorated with jonquils.
Listen for a moment. At a fancy-dress ball, do you
think it politic for the painfully “uninteresting’’ young
man with scarlet hair and yellow teeth to go in ordinary
evening dress, and tell enquiring friends that he’s just )
come as a “plain gentleman?” I don’t think so.
What you might call Miss Bessie Doyle’s private view s
came off at Paling’s rooms on last Saturday afternoon in ■'
the presence of a select mob of top-sparklers, including
Madame Kellermann, Poussard, Hazon—but you know
the list. The “view’’was a complete success from tile-
opening concerto to the Barcarole of Hans Stilt, which
was ’thusiastically encored in a manner that predicted
S.R.O. houses for the whole of the Doyle season.
Even if Miss Bessie could not fiddle like fun, you could
not want your money back when she once made her
curtsey. There is more than a good stage presence and a
pretty face—there is a suggestion of dreamy soulfulness
about her, and in looking upon Our Own fiddleress one
feels a comforting conviction that she couldn’t, under
any circumstances, have a weakness for corned beef and
cabbage. On Saturday the picture she and her fiddle
made, quite transfixed me. The night was poetically
gloomy, and the only light was over her head. She is o ’
medium height and slender, with dark hair and ’witching-
eyes, and her dress was very plainly made—of black silky
stuff cut to a train with an odd sort of jewel-clasp, and a
happy-go-lucky bunch of white Marguerites for orna-
ments. As she stood, obviously very nervous, gracefully
preparing to astonish us, she reminded me of some
artistic pictures one happens on in the magazines. To
descend to plain figures, Miss I).’s playing is a satisfying
thing, and she puts enough real soul into it to keep every
true lover of burlesque and the ballet miles away from her
show. I shall be interested to see how many of the other
sort there arc in Sydney.
Apropos music, Miss Julio Hack’s concert, the booking
for which was very heavy in the Potts Point direction,
occurred too late for notice this week. Next week my
g rose-quill goes into the honey on the subject.
1 That rather lovely breach-of-promise case recently
before a Southern law-court had one or two new features.
J-'or one, it was rather unusual to find that it was a man
who enlightened the defendant on the naughtiness of the
plaintiff. Generally it’s a veiled and mysterious female
with a sinister expression to her very hair-pins, who get»
the trusting lover by the ear and turns the other lady’s
dream of joy into a horrible nightmare ; but for a man lo
drop darkling hints as to the moral rectitude of another
man’s fiancee is quite a novelty. As a rule, the short-
haired half of humanity don’t exactly telephone for
Nemesis to drop upon a woman, for some reason or other
—conscience, perhaps ; but still they don’t.
Another phase of the 8.P.-suit might be whistled to
“Tommy make room for your uncle,” and shows how
difficult it is to know whether the charming girl who goes
about with her “little niece” is really that engaging
infant’s aunt or whether she is a total stranger brandish-
ing a mock relation in the eye of society ; or, deeper still’
whether she is modestly disclaiming her own handiwork
for various reasons ?
Talking about B.P. suits—there were several glimpses
of woman-nature in the suit, recently before a Sydney
court, brought by an East Indian against his recalcitrant
charmer. The gentleman, it appeared, had paid her passage
to Australia, and given her many presents before she left.
When he arrived in Australia he had some difficulty to
find the defendant. When he did find her she was quite a
different woman. “ Before she always run and kissee me.
This time she ask me sit down, my lordship.” She kissed
him, you see, before her passage was paid, and she offered
him a chair afterwards! Such is life—and love ! She
lost the case and has to pay the costs—and go to gaol
unless the costs be paid! But he says, poor, infatuated
wretch, that he is still willing to marry her. If she
marries him, leaves him at the church-door and stalks off
under the protection of an amateur pugilist, her husband
can’t put her in gaol. Happy thought!
By the way, do women value men at a higher figure
than that at which men assess women ? It would be a
t milling subject for a debating society with not too many
young orators. Meanwhile, in the absence of discussion,
the humiliating idea that the case stands as put is forced
upon me by the fact that in the breaches-of-promise
which have amused us recently the blighted lady made her
faithless lover’s valuation tot up three thousand pounds !
In the other case the male plaintiff unflatteringly con-
sidered £2OO was compensation for what he had lost !
Women at large will probably never learn sense, and
while there are petticoated female idiots who sneak out to
attend a rendezvous arranged in a newspaper with a man
of whom they know absolutely nothing we shall have
duplicate Kate Rounsevelles with all the risks that
courageous lady ran. Here are two promising advertise-
ments coming one on top of the other in the good Sydney
Telegraph, which treated us all to such a chaste sermon
on newspaper ethics, the other day ;
TWILL Gentleman who smiled at Lady in Herald
’ ’ office, Monday, and again when she was waiting
for ’bus, kindly give name and address to Elsey, P 0.,
Park-street, City.
V' OUNG Lady who recognised Gent, in straw hat,
white vest, as she left Enmore tram at Liverpool-
st., 6.40 Sunday evening, June 26, might communicate
with admirer.
1 wonder what Sir George Innes thinks of that !
The late Mister Deeming sometimes wore a white vest
and probably looked just as harmless as “gent in straw
hat ” until he got before a jury. And Deeming’s smile
was considered one of that hero’s chiefest attractions, I
believe, and his most potent weapon of conquest. Can
my dear sisters have forgotten the Awful Warning (in big
capitals) against dalliance with unknown admirers which
that gentleman’s adventures furnished such a little while
ago?
Lord and Lady Jersey presided at a recent nice ing of
Sydney City Mission at Waterloo, and, of course, both the
“crowned heads” had a little say. Lady J. (in semi-
mourning) made a trite speechlet which, viewed strictly
from a Waterloo standpoint, was fitfully amusing. The
titled speaker advised the mothers present to teach their
children obedience and helpfulness—“to be polite; to
re juest, not to order,” and so on—lovely copy-book conn
sellings of the highest grade, of course ; but, it’s ail very
well to talk—just think of the life a “polite gutter-
child ” would lead in Waterloo ! And it’s a question, too,
whether the local mamma knows exactly what childish
politeness consists of herself. She was probably brought
up by the hair and she drags her family up according to
hereditary instinct. When you tell her to teach Temmy
to be “ polite ” the only result is that she takes two twists
instead of one in his startled red hair and bangs his skull
twice as hard against the chimbley. Lady Jersey’s refined
counsels, intrinsically commendable as they were, struck
me at the time as being on a par with the thoughtfulness
of the Christian society girl who insists on teaching the
labouring man’s wife how to make a Russian salad.
Lord Jersey’s speech on this occasion was decidedly re-
assuring and settled a question that has long been
agitating society at large. In concluding, the good-
natured Gov. assured the audience that, though sometimes
forced to put on splendid clothes and wear an uncomfort-
able cocked hat, yet “he teas only human like them-
selves.” This is the sort of information that never comes
too late.
Lord Jersey had rather an interesting experience at
Wentworth when he was dodging round that settlement
on his last back-blocks picnic. When he arose to depart
he went genially round the town to bid good-bye to some,
,if not all, of his hospitable entertainers. But lo ! every
one of them was too inarticulate in the feet to be able to
stand up without the help of a steam crane, so he aban-
doned the farewell idea and got away unsquoze. The only
sober man he found in the town was a Quaker!
I regret extremely that last week I solidified into a
paragraph a floating rumour that a Sydney medical man’s
two children had hurt themselves “playing at Deeming.”
As a matter of fact (which is always what I aim at) the
story is only a baseless and probably a malicious rumour,
and the youngsters are really as right as ninepence.
Relationships— pur et simple—are always puzzling to an
outsider, but when you come to think how often the
unctuous old gentleman with the paternal manner isn’t
the “ uncle ”of his pink-cheeked small-waisted “ niece ’
and with what monotonous frequency it turns out that
nobody died and left the charming golden-haired girl as a
solemn trust to a “guardian ” about five years her junior
—when one revolves the frequent perversions of lawful
connections one secs, to believe anybody even on the
identity of his grandmother (if she happens to have one
tooth in more than is compatible with the circumstances
of the case) is to do a silly thing.
Mr. Alfred Nathan (of Macnamara & Nathan, solicitors),
leaves Sydney soon on a trip to Europe, where some of
the time will go in putting a lasting shine on his vocal
register. Going to study music on the Continong, in
short.
By the way, people are asking what it means when a
charming and well-pursed young widow always trots
round the Block with a parson in tow? Does it mean that
the parson is the widow’s anointed as it were? or does
she only keep him handy in case she makes up her mind
in a hurry ?
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
When the N.S. W. Parliament meets, the
Ministry will be violently attacked on its Defence
Commission appointments. Even the shorthand-
writership will probably form the subject of a
debate.

less distressful comedy in four acts. The motive
of this new piece is obscure and foggy, and the
plot is as disjointed as a torn lobster, but the first
duty of a comedy is to be amusing, and the
“ Pleasant Home ” is amusing a great part of the
time. It is based upon an uncle who goes away
from home for reasons that are not very well
defined—because the uncle is in full shriek the
instant the curtain rises and hasn’t a chance to
explain—and leaves a racketty nephew in charge
of the house, and the nephew straightway calls in
a bad character with a red head, and they turn
the mansion into a boarding-house. The boarding-
house isn’t a success, and presently the premises
seem to be given over to hogs, dogs, and devils
and the great What-is-it. There are always cats
going mad on the stairs, and the galvanic
boarder having fits and porous plasters in
the back parlour, and the invisible boarder
howling wretchedly on the second floor, and the
leg-show boarder bounding out of her room in
tights, and crashing up against the old, pious
boarder, and the bailiffs are after the boarder
with the eye-glass, and the insane boarder swallows
an car-trumpet or something, and has paroxysms
among the furniture to the horror of the peaceful
fat boarder. There are 700 doors in the piece—
more or less—and a boarder is concealed behind
each of them, and if he is seen there he will be
lost, and another bot tler is trying to burst in, and
if he can’t get in be will be found, and if he is
f mud lie will be ruined. No one knows why all
CHARLES BRADLEY.
these tilings are except possibly the demented
boarder, who has the wild, haggard look of a man
that is about to start a newspaper in the
bush, and the iron-jawed wife of the fat
boarder who thinks her husband is in love with
the boarder in tights. There are cigar-ashes
and torn letters all over the place, and somebody
is always arriving in a breathless state at the
front door, and, finally, the uncle comes back,
apparently off his head, and meets all these
boarders, and is considerably astonished. Then
the uncle lives happily ever afterwards, so far as
we are aware, and the insane boarder comes out
and has a last fit on the sofa, and the fat boarder
is forgiven, and the misunderstanding with the
boarder in tights is cleared up in time to prevent
the invisible boarder upstairs wrecking the whole
establishment, and the other characters either
break their necks on the stair, or make a fortune
in silver scrip, or something.
# * *
There is no well-defined heroine in this
amazing show. Miss Bella Bashall as the boarder
in tights takes deservedly a large share of the
applause, and a very little is left over for Mrs.
Bennett. But what ought to be the centre of the
piece is the insane boarder as played by Mr.
Poulton—-a character that is one-half “ the Private
Secretary ” and one-half galvanic monkey prancing
up a yellow stick, and both halves supremely
ludicrous. Instead of this, however, the author's
great effort is to make the play revolve round Mr.
J. R. Greville, the fat boarder, and this puts it
somewhat out of joint. Messrs. F. J. Currier,
Shine, and Lash Gordon are the other prominent
features, but inasmuch as they are compelled, by
the exigencies of the comedy, to tear across the
stage at full gallop most of the time they don't
display any features of particular interest. “A
Pleasant Home ” isn't a restful production. With
the exception of the fat boarder, hardly anybody
has a moment's leisure, and when the leading
characters find a sofa or a mahogany table in the
way they generally rush through it for want of
time to go round. This undue haste makes the
boarders look unnatural at times, but otherwise it
does no particular harm. Next Saturday, Miss
Jennie Lee starts for a season of one week in the
ever-welcome character of “Jo,” and her well-
worn broom which has swept so many crossings
will be again in evidence.

“ Marjorie,"' announced for production at
Sydney Her Majcqiifefon Wednesday, too late for
notice in this issue,'Waft first acted in Australia at
Melbourne Princess' in December, 181)0, when The
Bulletin pronounced its music, by Walter
Slaughter, as “unambitious but always tuneful
and sometimes quite original.” It was, at that
time, “magnificent and mediaeval,” and lavishly
mounted, and there is no reason to believe that it
has lost its glory by now. A new Marjorie has been
found in Miss Florence Young, and George Lauri,
a comedian who has attained fame and fortune in
America, essays to fill the gap left vacant by
Elton as Gosric.

“ The Merchant of Venice ” boomed at
Sydney Garrick on Saturday night amid all the
enthusiasm which the little theatre could hold.
As Shylock, the stately Hebrew who discounted
Antonio’s “ beel ” in Venice, Mr. Bentley was at
his best, and his Jew was a memorable success.
There was nothing small or grovelling about the
dramatic usurer, nothing even faintly suggestive
of the retail pawnbroking industry, or the bill-of-
sale over the furniture of two rooms and a
kitchen; he was a big;, masterful Jew from first
to last—the ideal Semite who is so often heard of
and so seldom met with in real life, built after
the probable fashion of the great original Israelite
—the hook-nosed spearman whose burnished beak
reflected the light of the setting sun as his tribe
looked down on doomed Palestine away back in the
year 2, or thereabouts. If that legendary plunderer
ever existed, Shylock is his double, and if he never
existed at all and Palestine was merely seized
under a mortgage then Shylock is intended to
represent him as he ought to have been but wasn’t.
Walter Bentley’s Hebrew was exceedingly real,
and when he slowly polished up his butcher’s
knife in the trial-scene and ground the edge on his
capacious shoe he was a cheerful reminiscence of
the Psalmist when he was out chopping up Philis-
tines Jin the name of the old war-god of Judah.
Shylock himself was the soul of the drama, and so
long as he was there the audience didn’t care
whether Antonio was cut up or not, or whether
Gratiano and the rest were massacred along with
him. Miss Hansen’s Portia was pretty and in-
telligent and elagently dressed, but there were no
very strong points about her; and Jessica, per-
petrated by Miss Grace Hamilton, was a
nice-looking Jewess whoso mission was obviously
fulfilled when she bolted with a Venetian dude.
The merchant —by our esteemed friend, Bill South
—seemed an honourable and upright man whose
only fault was that his voice came from theabysse s
of his boots ; and George
Coppin, junior, played
the part of the frowsy
Hebrew, Tubal, to con-
siderable ad vantage.
A Iso, Bassanio and
Gobbo, as delineated by
Messrs. Roberts and
Clitlierow, were suffici-
ently good. Mr. Bent-
ley benefits on Friday, in
“ Othello ” —for the first
and last time in Sydney
—and then lie proposes
to pack up his ruined
Hebrew and his other
properties, and leave for
brighter scenes.

The past week at
Sydney Criterion has
been one of shreds and
patches. “Adrienne
Lecouvreur” was suc-
ceeded on Saturday by
“Masks and Faces,”
which ran with much
eclat for one consecutive
night. “ London Assur-
ance ” was put up on
Monday before a crowded
audience, and when it
was finished the ques-
tion whether it was
writte. by Boucicault or
the other fellow was left
as unsettled as before,
and the ghosts of the
two dead authors pro-
bably fought the matter
out in the deserted build-
ing when the audience
was gone, and the lights
were out, and the graves
gave up their dead.
“ Fedora’’was announced
for Tuesday ivght as the
last tragedy of Mrs.
Beere’s season, and her last opportunity of
demonstrating to the people of Sydney that
this world is but a fleeting show, and that
everything is out of joint, and it would
be better for mankind in general that they
had never been born. “The School for Scandal,”
for one night only, and “ Masks and Faces,” put
up on Thursday for Mrs. Beere’s benefit, close the
proceedings. Then the Sydney johnny will heave
his last ill-directed bouquet, and the great
tragedienne will depart, and unless the Bibbs
Government makes some considerable improve-
ments in the tariff next session, and closer super-
vision is exercised in the winding-up of Abigail’s
bank, and the financial institutions of N.S. Wales
are required to make a solid deposit with the
Government as security for their creditors, Heaven
only knows when that province can afford to
look upon her like again.

As for the other assorted shows of
Sydney, some of them have no flies upon
them, and some have. The Gettysburg Cycle-
rama is much as usual, and time writes no wrinkle
on the azure brow of Dan Tracey, who holds forth
at the School of Arts with bi.a customai y ability.
Miss Bessie Doyle, “our own violinist,” is
announced to give two concerts at the Centenary
Hall, under the patronage of the Bench and
the Ministry, the consuls, musical societies, and
“the Army,"whatever that may be — The Bulletin
didn’t really know there was one. Also, on July
14, Carl Hertz, the magician and illusionist, will
commence a two weeks’ season at the Garrick,
and will cause people and things to disappear
unaccountably. If it is also within the resources
of his art to bring back sundry people who have
already disappeared and are much wanted by the
depositors, he will leave a name behind him that
will not soon be forgotten.

In this issue appears the portrait of Mr.
Charles Bradley, the well-known Australian
author and dramatist. Mr. Bradley first
success when he produced the drama, “Nobly
Won,” which was staged with much eclat at Bris-
bane Royal, in 1887. He followed tins with
“ Left to Perish," which was presented in Mel-
bourne by Miss Ada Ward ; and “Mr. Barnes o
New York,” which was played by the lamented
Signor Majeroni and his talented wife. Hj s u ( ' x ,

The friends —and they are innumerable—
f Mr. G. L. Goodman, acting-manager of the
“busted Sydney Royal, have decided to present
with a testimonial. Mr. Goodman has been
connected with the Royal for 15 years, and all
that time he has been a man and a brother in the
highest sense of the term ; therefore this little,
benefit should be a great success.
The above is intended to explain, in a sympa-
thetic, Shakespearean way, that George Rignold
has brought his clever show to Melbourne at a
bare, bleak time, when hunger stalks in the
market-place and the imaginative faculty is trying
to devise a means of meeting bills which are full
of stern fact. George’s bill, being of the immortal
poetical order, attracted but a meagre attendance
to the Princess’. The rising generation of foot-
ballers, who had never seen “ A Midsummer
Night's Dream ” in the flesh, nor troubled
to wrestle with that beautiful play id the
spirit, showed no desire to make its acquaint-
ance on Saturday. The artistic loss will
be the public’s if they continue to stay
away, but the financial loss will fall upon the
management, and necessitate a speedy withdrawal
of the Bard’s poem in favour of a mundane drama
with a tank in it. This is a consummation
devoutly to be regretted. “A Midsummer
Night’s Dream,” as here presented on the stage, is
a charming show in some places and a sufficiently
funny comedy in others. There are moments
when it loses touch with earthly things and gently
lifts the dullest spectator into a world of phantasy;
as, for instance, when Titania woos the translated
weaver and falls a-slumbering with his donkey-
head against her cheek. A more convincing
realisation of the impossible is seldom attained
behind the footlights. Throughout this scene,
which is a triumph of stage painting and weird
effects, Miss Spong plays her part of the illusion
for all it is worth. She becomes a fairy down to
the feet, but more especially about the arms, and
her affection for the monster seems both warm
and spiritual at once.
The Shakespearean influence is asserting itself
considerably in this notice, but no matter. George
Rignold’s performance of Bottom, the weaver, has
spoken for itself many a time and oft, and needs
no more bush just now. Of the other comic
Athenians, good old Stirling Whyte seems more
sterling than ever, whilst among the mortal hong
long, Cosgrove is the least open to complaint.
Little Mabel Bussell is a pleasant surprise as
Puck, but several other performers are more sur-
prising than pleasant, and may bo the subject of
mild protest in our next. The ankles of the in-
cidental fairies present an earthly appearance,
and three sprites, who come and disappear in a
mystic manner, are otherwise ordinary atrocities,
and might be dispensed with.

At Melbourne Royal there was a big
Saturday-house for “The Trumpet Call,” and a
disposition to take patches of that melancholy
waste of money in a serious spirit. Miss Edith
Blaude’s vigorous acting, in the dissolute char-
acter of the woman who always turns up when she
is thought to be dead, relieved the monotony of the
pageant. Also, Miss Kate Bishop put a quantity
of feeling into a lot of unnecessary distress, and
the Bland Holts rushed to the “comic relief,”
with untiring energy, and the rest of the company
tried hard to make folks believe that “The
Trumpet Call ” is a panorama with a purpose.
But it isn’t. It is merely a dull, expensive narra-
tive interspersed with soldiers, and the rising Aus-
tralian refuses to have his mind excited by roars and
rumours and wars upon the stage. The hero who
hurls himself into a campaign and crawls up the
cannon’s mouth in order to banish bitter memories
an exhausted volcano, and the widowed wife
who thinks her husband perished in the engage-
ment where he didn’t perish at all has lost much
of her original interest,

The Alexandra was reopened with another
military drama, and a select orchestra of four,
who discoursed slow music whilst Alf. Boothman
Pervaded the situation in a dual role. “ Not

Watts Phillips, but the company at the back of
tjoothman require to be mostly born again, and
the spectacular effects leave a large sense of some-
huig wanting. The prices are modestly arranged,

The double bill at the Bijou has kept
Jitters lively at the pretty little theatre whence
several old favourites are departing. Lawrence,
the Moody of “The Country Girl.” was under-
stood to be playing his last on Saturday, and
Pattie Browne and Lyndal quit the garish scene
forthwith. Pattie’s departure will be emphasised
with an impressive benefit on Friday afternoon,
the Premier, as a brother native, having placed
his august name at the head of the committee.

Matters elsewhere are flourishing and
otherwise. The Italians drew a crowd to the
Exhibition concert on Saturday last, and are
appearing again during the week. Coghill
Brothers make money at St. George’s Hall, but
the Vie. has shut up in disgust. The Rotunda is
open again witli a strong concert company, and
Fitzgerald’s Circus looks like lasting through the
winter. The tent has held its own for twelve
consecutive weeks, anyway.
Through the sweet Midsummer Night
One may dream of elf and sprite,
Mystic forms of fancy born.
Dancing in the pale moonlight—
Dream the Dream of Bard sublime
In the drowsy summer time,
When the cricket midst the corn
Seems to sing an impish rhyme.
But when night falls cold and chill
Over dale and over hill,
Fairy fictions withered die,
Winter frosts unkindly kill
Tender flowers of poetry.
Thus the burden of our song.
Though warbled vainly,
When the Fairy Hilda Spong
Strokes those ears so round and long,
And loves insanely
Beast ungainly—
“ Trip, trip, trip, upon the grass,
Would we were that other ass ! ”

When Deeming’s Eainhill cottage was being re-erected
in the chamber of horrors at Tussaud’s Waxworks, the

Swanston isn’t feeling very well.

The humane Leumane has come forward with a pro-
posal to arrange a series of concerts for the benefit of
Melbourne unemployed. The scheme suggested by this
benevolent tenor is sound and simple. If the various
suburban corporations will provide a free town-hall,
piano, printing and advertising (which wouldn’t need to
be extensive) a number of artists will give their services
towards a couple of entertainments per week, and a
representative of the Age can act as treasurer and pay in
the entire receipts to the office-fund.
Some hopeless crank writes thus of the fat, greasy,
commonplace Oscar Wilde, as a musician;—“This is
astral music ; and if he who wrote it has not lived afore-
time in Egypt and in Syria, in violet-crowned Athens and
in Dante’s own city of flowers, I have misunderstood the
music. I prefer to think that he has haunted some black
colossal temple of Isis, a pure priest in saffron robes, and
looked into the eyes of the sphinxes with eyes as long and
subtle as their own ; that he walked with the Saviour
among the lilies of the field in Palestine ; that he walked
with Sophocles in white Colonus, or listened to Agathon’s
rose-red praise of love and joy with Socrates at the sym-
posium that Plato tells of. He has beheld the Phoenix
rise from its ashes, and knows the meaning of it all; he
has worshipped the ibis and the serpent, and tenderly
buried the bones of dead kine in the isle of Prosopis ; he
has known the rites of Melita ; he has seated himself at a
table in Galilee and broken bread with the Lord ; he has
fed the sparrows of Aphrodite in the temple precinct of
her marble abode in Paphos.” Who can drivel like the
British critic ?
Our Mr. Cartwright, who is playing Cromwell in Sims

Protector “a tender and pathetic old gentleman—so like
an old lady.”
Englishers have a noble opinion of Australia. In the
“ new ” English play, “The Fringe of Society ” (founded
on an old French one, Dumas’ “Demi-Monde”), the
heroine, Mrs. Eve-Alien, has been divorced from her first
husband, but does not choose to mention that fact when
she is seeking to entrap into marriage an Australian
millionaire, Arthur Cuthbert. Says a reviewer in a
London journal:—“Surely the fact that Mrs. Eve-Alien
is only ‘ on the fringe of society ’ would matter little in
the colonies to which her lover proposes to bear her off
directly after marriage.” "Anything’s good enough for
the kawlinies.”
Keiley, the Borsa in “ Rigoletto,” at Melb. Princess’, is

Phil. Stuart’s newly-arrived tattooed man, “Captain
Fisher,” held an interesting Melbourne press-view leviie
the other day, and aired himself in a state of nature be-
tween two whisky-decanters and an asbestos stove. The
Captain told his romantic yarn in a plaintive tone of long-
suffering resignation, until the lady representative of a
Melbourne paper came prancing in “ to see your new
curiosity, Mr. Stuart.” When the tatui looked at her
with the air of a dashing militaire of the old school, and
she saw that he had no clothes on, she fled shrieking from
the ro'om, and the Tattooed Man laughed right down to his
nethermost vignette. “Lady reporters” ought to take
out a surgery degree before they shove in everywhere
after the men.
In course of an action against H. M. Stanley by

tion. He lost £7OO by the lectures.”
Mr. “Atkinson” (young Fittes, of Melbourne), “the

Janet Achurch, writes The Bulletin correspondent, was
badly advised in challenging comparison between herself
and Miss Ward in “Forget-Me-Not,” which was put up at
London Avenue vice “A Doll’s House,” which this time
quite failed. Miss A. did her very best, but she was not
equal to the part, her mannerisms of voice being pain-
fully evident. She had, however, some good moments,
and cannot be said to have failed altogether. As for poor,
ponderous Charrington, the less said the better. He has
rarely been seen to worse advantage (and that means a lot)
than in the character of Sir Horace Welby so identified
with the name of W. H. Vernon.
Mr. Pigott, the British Examiner of Plays, is no
Ibsenite. In his evidence before the Commons Committee
on Theatres he said that “he had studied Ibsen’s plays
carefully, and he thought all the characters were morally
deranged. All the heroines were either dissatisfied
spinsters who looked upon matrimony as a sort of
monopoly, or married women who were in a chronic state
of rebellion against all conditions that nature had im-
posed upon their sex, or against the social and moral
restraints applicable to wives and mothers. All the main
characters are either rascals or imbeciles.” Ibsen has
probably never been so concisely summed up before.
In Vienna recently a huge benefit performance was
given on behalf of the Actors’ Benevolent Fund. All the
characters were inverted, the tragedian doing low comedy,
and the tragedienne singing a comic song, while the funny
men all took the tragic parts, and so on. How would
such a show go in Australia, the performance consisting
of scraps from half a dozen plays, with J. C. Williamson
as Joseph Surface, George Rignold as the Widow O’Brien,
Robert Brough as Othello, Royce as Macbeth, and
Walter Bentley as Blueskin ? It should be worth seeing.
Looking at “ Joan of Arc,” here is an idea: the theatres
make up their pieces all of music-hall business, and then
complain if the music-halls pick out little bits of drama.
Charrington wouldn’t let Flemming act Sir Horace

All the Melbourne papers, in describing the production
of Wycherly’s “ Country Girl ” at the Bijou, mentioned
that the original was, from a modern standpoint, disgust-
ing and indecent. Since then, all the booksellers in
Melbourne have had numerous enquiries for a not too
much expurgated copy of that author’s plays, and there
has been a perfect rush on the Public Library. Dirt
always sells well.
At Hobart the management of a skating-rink fishes for
the elite by advertising one night in the week as “ strictly
fashionable.” On one of these “ fashionable ” evenings
the manager was requested by a sassiety young man to
remove a “feller” who was not of the magic circle, dont-
cherknow. The manager protested that the “feller”
was personally known to him and he could vouch for his
respectability. But he was told that respectability didn’t
count anyhow—“ the ladies indignantly refuse to skate in
the same room with a man who serves in a shop !” The
young man had to go.

Persistently rumoured that Mary Anderson returns to

Sarah Bernhardt recently showed an English inter-
viewer her scrap-book, with all the Australian notices,

Kate Santley had no sooner returned to the music-hall
stage than she broke, so they said, a small bone in her

Harry Rickards, at Brisbane Gaiety, complained from
the stage that he had been forestalled in the “ Ta-ra-ra-

The Broken Hill lock-out is a godsend to those
responsible for the woeful condition of the big mine,
which may fall in at any moment. A manager of big
reputation who inspected the Proprietary mine last year
for the first time, declared it to be one of the richest and
most extravagantly-worked mines in the world, and that
with all the extravagance in soft-wood timbering, &c., it
would probably collapse within a year. He saw an army
of men watching and repairing the square-sets, another
army was cutting them out, and above this yawning
cavern the whole of the machinery-thousands of tons of
it—rested on the hanging-wall side of the lode. The
mine, he said, might have been worked at half the outlay,
and had the ore taken out been put back as slag the
place would have been safe enough. To do this now is
quite another matter, but something of the sort will have
to be done or the mine abandoned.
* * •
Apart from the question whether it is better to
smelt locally or at Port Pirie, the price (£26,000) to be
paid by the Proprietary for the British smelters is a pro-
digious one, but then it has been the rule of the Proprie-
tary to give the very biggest money for everything. The
miners are now asked to pay the difference between
economy and extravagance.
* # *
The attempts made to reduce the earnings of the
Barrier and Tasmanian miners follow in the natural order
of things. On the Barrier it is the effect of extravagant
and incompetent management, of which, of course, the
miners are to be the victims. In Tasmania it is the effect
of a wild boom of valueless silver mines. Because tens
of thousands have been squandered on barren ground,
and hundreds of thousands lost in share gambling, the
miners are asked to pull the mines through by a lower
rate of wage.
m * *
A man who is probably the largest shareholder
in the biggest of mines, has openly accused certain of the
directors of working the mine to suit themselves, adding
that he held more shares than all the directors put
together, and that more than one of them had to borrow
shares to maintain his qualification.
* * *
With what wonderful unanimity publicity is
given to the “ serious state of things ” in the Proprietary
mine now that the stock has depreciated millions! Months
ago there appeared in this column a two-line paragraph
to the effect that the “creep” in the mine was nothing
compared to the creep out of it. Nor did we minimise
the seriousness of the creeps. From time to time there
was published a warning-note that the big mine could not
rest on timber, and unless filled in with its slag it would
one day fill itself in. This great danger was apparent to
every miner employed in it. It must have been known
by the management. It was periodically denied, and even
up to a fortnight ago the newspapers were full of assur-
ances of safety under such headings as a “Slight Co-
llapse,” &c. A main shaft since abandoned as absolutely
wrecked was described as “ having had its timbers slightly
disturbed.” The open-cut system was proclaimed as the
new economical method of working, and with such reitera-
tion that the poorpublic believed it. As a matter of fact,
it was only done to prevent the mine collapsing. Never-
theless the shares continued to fall under the “creep-
out,” and now that they are almost down to zero we have
at last the truth about the “huge fissure,” “ the deplor-
able state of the timbers,” “the giving way of the
shafts,” and the prediction of an early fall-in.

Baker’s Creek mine lias, since its start four and
a half years ago, raised 20,000 tons for 80,000 ozs. of gold.
Somewhat remarkable that the first gold bearing reef
found in that tremendous gorge where there are many
others, should bo better than all the others put together.
It is a magnificent shoot of gold contained in a reef which
does not average six inches.

Tlie Mb. Galena, one of the recently-boomed
N.S.'V silver-mines, has sickened considerably-perhaps
off the shoot of payable ore ! Jit. Stewart smeltings, too
are coming down, the last being only ICozs. to the ton.
# ft *
With tin at .£lOO per ton there are lots of places
in N.S.VV. where parties of miners, without the aid of
capital and with the crudest appliances, might knock out
a fairly good living, A hint to the skilled unemployed.

Something like a boom in Bendigo, where

Hillgrove wants N.S.W. Government to send
parties out to prospect the surrounding ranges and
gorges. Tub Bulletin trusts the Government will
decline. No doubt there are “other ricli reefs in the
district,” hut if they cannot be found without State aid,
they had better be left for a future and more enterprising
generation. Jlining is low enough, Heaven knows, hut
we don’t want to pauperise it. To control a private pros-
pecting party is difficult enough ; to send out State
parties would mean all sorts of villanies.

North Johnstons —that grand old mine from
which tens of thousands of ozs. of gold have been raised
during the last quarter of a century is reported to he
“again on gold.” It so, we know what that means —
another period of dividends. There is nothing patchy
about its reefs, and nothing sensationally rich, hut a big
body of one-oz. rock.

A cable says that Major’s Creek, N.S.W., has

The Zeehan and Dundas smelters have been
running about a month, and have about the same time to
run, and then the ore supplies are down for a time (a
long time, we’re afraid). What the Dundas railway will
have to do then puzzles a good many. The w hole field
threatens to be one of the biggest of mining failures, and
Hobart, people are beginning to realise this.

All the Pambula batteries are working for the
first time since their erection, and as several are running
on accumulated heaps, it will not he long before half of
them are again idle. After waiting many months for
some wonderfully cheap process of saving infinitesimally

treatment.

At last week’s meeting of the Mercantile
Finance Co. (Jlelb.) an attempt was made to discover
something about “Johanne Neilson,” figuring as the
holder of many thousand shares. The chairman admitted
that neither Neilson nor the original holder (for whom the
mysterious N. was a dummy seemingly) had paid the
recent call on all these shares, hut when asked to give
the name of the original holder the chairman said that
“ no good purpose would he served by disclosing it.” The
great financial policy of Melbourne directors is to be
solemnly mute about jobbery for which outside share-
holders have to suffer.

Attorney-General Barton has promised to amend

Ex-Premier Atkinson, of Maoriland, fell

end, and then run his measures through a House
that was too dead-tired to offer any opposition,
and he smashed himself up in the effort. His end
was ascribed to heart-disease, but he really died
of utter, unspeakable weariness. He was not a
great success as a statesman ; he worked in a
groove, and was a good, conscientious mediocrity
of the old type. But he was more honest than
the average of politicians, and never ran any
mysterious banks or got an overdraft in a way
that was calculated to arouse suspicion, and he

Committee think he was wrong in doing so, and
have passed a censure on him to which he will not
submit, and bo has demanded a special meeting
to discuss the matter. Whether he be right or
wrong there can be no two opinions as to the
action of the committee in taking the matter up
in such a spirit, for no one can doubt the good

Among cur cue patent medicines vended in
Australia, there are few so largely in demand as
Clements Tonic. Despite the comparatively short
period that has elapsed since it first came before
the public, it has already practically supplanted
many older and apparently well-established reme-
dies, and judging by the vast number of testi-
monials published by the proprietor—testimonials
that are signed by persons within easy reach, and
whose statements can be verified if wanted—its
popularity would seem to be thoroughly well-
founded. Hitherto, Australians have been too
apt to trust to any medicine which came from the
farthest ends of the earth, and to despise every-
thing of local origin, but it is gratifying to note
that this tendency is passing away, and that a
remedy of local manufacture can stand before the
public on its own merits.
The Goode will case, which broke down
badly in N.S.W. Probate Court a few days ago, is
a romance after the manner of the three-volume
Yellowback, with a picture of the swarthy villain
and the shrieking heroine with her hair down
upon the front cover. Old Josiah (Joode, the
heavy father of the story, may be briefly described
as a rather dirty and drink-smelling old man with
property. He left his wife, or else she left him,
or else he threw her out, and after a time he
became the friend and protector of a certain un-
specified lady named Roland. How they became
acquainted isn’t stated-possibly Mrs. Roland
advertised in the News for a nice old gentleman
to lend her .£5. Then old Goode drank himself
off this earthly scene, leaving to his wife and
Madame Roland a life interest in his property—
the Dnbbo Hospital to annex the pile at their
death. Then ten years “rolled on”; Goode’s
widow married again, and her husband tried to
upset the will and failed. Then more years rolled
on, and one Maurice Barnett put an advertisement
in the paper to the effect that he had found
another will by the alcoholised Goode, leaving all
his property to his wife. More law ensued, Bar-
nett swore that he had bought a greasy, battered,
moth-eaten pile of Young Ladies’ Journals in
Paddy’s Market, Melbourne, and found Goode’s
will folded inside one leaf. He tried to fold the
leaf so as to show how a heavy legal document
might remain inside it unnoticed for 12 years and
not fall out, but he failed badly. There was no
evidence to show that Goode was addicted to
Young Ladies’ Journals, and the court apparent-
ly found it hard to imagine the bleary old
paralytic sitting over the fire and reading with
feverish interest about the Gwendolen who lived in
Ghost Grange and loved a curate. The will pur-
ported to have been signed and witnessed in a
pub. at Richmond ; two men who went in casually
for drinks one cold night found an old person
mumbling and chattering in an arm-chair, and he
asked them to sign a document, which they did
without asking any questions. Then Goode’s
doctor arose and swore that the venerable patient
was at home in bed that night, and couldn’t have
reached Richmond alive except in an ambulance.
Some one else arose and proved that Maurice
Barnett was an expert forger who had done various
terms in gaol. After that the case collapsed amid
very strong remarks from Judge Manning. The
weak point in the scheme stands out very con-
spicuously. Obviously the will shouldn’t have
been found by Barnett, whose character was not
good enough for him to discover such documents
successfully; it should have been planted in an
old book and the book left among the second-
hand stock in Cole’s Arcade, and then someone
of repute might have seen it and sworn to it as a
bona-fide discovery. If it had been put in a
volume of “ Lives of the Saints,” for instance, tile
chances are that a bishop Would have dropped on
it in the end, or a respectable priest whose
character could bear inspection, or it might have
been found by Father M'Kernan or tne Escaped
Nun. Having documents of that kind discovered
by a man who is only lately out of gaol is suicidal.

More than 7000 unemployed have regis-

John Bray, who lasted two years and ten

South Australia has averaged 1 l-9th

sible Government in April, ’57.
Kingston says that so long as renegade
Stock and traitor Handyside remain on the S.A.
Treasury Benches lie will never relax his efforts to
blow Rat Castle sky high.
The Holder (S.A.) Government policy is
to be one, of “ rest and quiet.” The latest defini-
tion of this is “ give us rest and quiet whilst wo
draw our thousand a year.”
Holder, the new S.A. Premier, entered
Parliament five years ago as a Freetrader and a
Land Nationalisationist. lie has now dropped
both beliefs as being unpopular.
A Sydney financial agent asserts that the
Parliamentary pay of at least one-third of the

Considering his chief’s avowed Republi-

deucetlly indiscreet—or else a nasty rib-tickler.
The N. S. Wales Trades and Labour
Council is losing its influence and its members
through fiscal fends, and through the selfish

In Victoria public service salaries have
risen by A 520,903 since ISB4, the expenditure per

has entailed additional taxation upon each member

The vacant Wharf-street allotment in
Brisbane, where the Labour-party and the un-
employed bold forth, is locally known as the
“screaming ground.” A Government shorthand
reporter is always sent to tako notes.
When Ryan, M.L A. for the Barcoo (Q.),
returned to Brisbane after a few days’ absence ho
found 150 letters waiting for linn from con-
stituents, all t-f which required an answer. It is
no light job to be a Labour Member.
Solicitor-General Byrnes (Q.) had his appli-
cation for a vote rejected the other day, because
the form was improperly filled in. Gritfilwraith’s
new Elections Act will complicate matters a
hundredfold, until eventually the applicant will
require a lawyer’s services.
The new S.A. Ministry narrowly escaped
being thrown out on Tuesday week, which was thei r
first appearance in Parliament. There was actually
a majority against them, but as no good result
was likely to be gained by premature action, they
were allowed to live on sufferance until.
Griffith states that ho has received an
anonymous letter stating that he will be assassi-
nated if the Electoral Bill isn’t withdrawn. And
now we want to see the letter-book in the Colonial
Secretary’s office, for the chances are that the
missive in question was copied from sheer force of
habit before it was sent.
It is gratifying to hear about that petition
signed by (>OOO Protestant non-episcopal clergymen
from all parts of Ireland, setting forth that Home
Rule means Popish domination in the distressful
island. As it happens there are not 900 “ Protes-
tant non-episcopal clergymen ” in Ireland alto-
gether, but the Orange liar is impervious to small
discrepancies like that.
A superannuated parson has been giving
his views in Melbourne Age on the black-labour'
question. One of bis reasons why the traffic”
should be continued is that when in England ho
had known largo numbers of “Irish” to come
over at harvesting, live on next to nothing, and
take even less home with them than the Kanakas
do. What a debt of grat'tude the Irish do owe
tho Age !
Since the M 4 Kinloy tariff became law the
exports of tho United States have increased by 85
millions of dollars. Under present
reciprocity arrangements, Great Britain is slowly
being squeezed out of the foreign markets in which
Uncle Sam is competing. The various European
Powers naturally prefer the secured market of the
States to the uncertain facilities supplied by the
groat three-ball shop.
After all the racket about the loyal Pro-
testants of Ulster, and how they will perish in the
last ditch rather than go back on their faith, it is
surprising to note that the province returns 17
Nationalist members and only 10 Unionists. The
Orangemen are a minority even in Ulster, and all
they want, in a humble and godly way, is to rule,
not only the majority in their own province, but
all the rest of Ireland as well.
Deakin, like Patterson, is growing de-
pressed and woebegone. He, with all his party,
regarded Shiels as a mere temporary expedient,
and expected that his stopgap Ministry would die
in a few weeks of sheer inanition. And now an
impression is growing up that Shiel§ has come to
stay—possibly for years, and Deakin’s possible
Premiership is fading away into the dim unknown
where the lost politicians go.

Why don’t the Melbourne unemployed,
whose processions are stopped by the “Law,”
•calmly gaze in the face of the law’s myrmidon,
and inform it—the law's myrmidon is always
neuter gender—that they are not a procession, but
i.simply a number of men who arc each, by a
singular coincidence, walking in the same
■direction? Even Law will think twice of arrest-
ing an individual because his bootless feet happen
to be moving towards the same point as other
fellow’s dittos.
Said Sir E. Brad don, at the Royal Colonial
Institute : ...
In Australia’s population the taint of convictism is
inappreciable, firstly, because the majority of those who
were transported were not confirmed criminals,
offenders against arbitrary laws rather than reasonable
provisions for social benefits ; and secondly, "® ca ~
remainder — i.e., those who actually were hard oases
were, as a rule, beyond anything like domestic! >»
died without leaving heirs to the criminal instincts v men
might have been in them.
Ingenious, if not strictly ingenuous.
Many people seem to imagine, concerning
the “National Ass.,” which name is now the
universal designation for the bogus 4 National
Association of N.S. Wales, that the Ass. is a mere
abbreviation. This is wrong. * Ass isn t short tor
Association ; it is a separate word and is derived
from the hairy mule, on which Benjamin 1' ranklm
once rode to the poll to record his property-vote
in order to show the people that it was the quad-
ruped, and not ho, that really had the suffrage, ihe
mule, in fact, was hts qualification, and he brought
it along to prevent misconception.
According to local reports there are some-
thing like 14,000 Chinamen plodding over the
wastes of the Northern Territory in the hope or
sneaking into Queensland without paying the pod-
tax ; according to Griffith there are about 00 or
iOO. The truth lies somewhere between the two.
The country has dried up behind these miserable
Asiatics on their pilgrimage, and either Queens-
land must let them in or else they must go back
and leave their bones in the desert. There is rum
and leprosy in the one alternative and national
obloquy in the other. The cheap-labour curse is
coming home to roost.
The legal regulation of the working-day
will be a Waterloo for capitalistic greed.
Treasurer MTlwraith, of Queensland, says
that tlio unemployed at Townsville were offered
ill per week with board and lodging on the sugar
plantations, and refused the terms, and, on tho
strength of this, the Tory press howls more loudly
than over about the horrors of the inflated and
brutalised “ workin’ man.” Now, everybody knows
that the planters can get left-off in
almost any quantity for 10s. a week and tho use of
a dog-kennel, and won’t pay even that, and they
would as soon offer the Koh-i-noor as the aforesaid
205.; but the Queensland papers haven’t any mor-
bid craving after accuracy.
The sweater-capitalist loveth the present
Government Labour Bureau, because their cardinal
article of faith is officially expressed in the “N.B.’
to their advertising placards ; “No delay for em-
ployers ; a large field open of all trades and callings
to select from.” Delay for employes doesn’t
matter. And the whole arrangement means that
the sweater-employer can “sack” squad after
squad of men at short or no notice until he gets
the cheapest in tho starving mob. And the one
grand maxim of a democratic community is loftily
declaimed to be that the people’s Government is
NOT bound to provide work for its unemployed.
The bogus- 44 Patriotic ” League and the
Labour-party in Queensland are silently mar-
shalling their forces for a tremendous struggle at
next general elections. Votes outnumber men
already in all the likely labour electorates. The
property, or what Benjamin Franklin called
the ass vote, is the reason. The Burke,
Bundamba, Charters Towers, Dalby, Drayton,
Toowoomba, Fortitude Valley, Gympie, Wool-
loongabba, and Nundah are all instances. On the
other hand, in the squatter electorates, there are
often three and four times as many men as votes.
The disfranchisement of shearers, etc., helps to
account for this. Balonne, Bullo, Carpentaria,
Clermont, Warrego, Flinders, and the Barcoo
are all glaring cases.
Patterson, the big, overbearing member
for Castlemaine (Vie.), said in the Assembly
recently that it was to be hoped the Government
would not find work for the unemployed, as such
a course would tend to pauperise the people. And
The Bulletin, which can be as brutal as Patter-
son when it feels inclined, devoutly hopes that if
that gentleman is ever run over by a tram-car, or
choked by a garrotter, the Government - as repre-
sented by the adjacent policeman—won't come to
his assistance lost that outdoor aid should pauperise
Patterson, don’t you know. Patterson was pauper-
ised once by the Government finding him a job in
the Ministry, and the effect was so bad that the
experiment should not be repeated.
When the Trades’ Disputes Conciliation
and Arbitration Act was passing through N.S.W.
Assembly it was argued by certain Labour mem-
bers that if the measure did not contain a compul-
sory clause it must prove abortive. The verity of
this was proved just as soon as the Act came into
use, when the Typographical Association offered
to submit a wage-lowering dispute to arbitration,
and tho daily newspaper proprietaries, wlo had
previously lauded the principle and the Bill to the
skies, promptly refused. The fact is that arbitra-
tion on the mutual-agreement basis was just as
possible before the Act was passed as now. The
employers of labour always were adverse to submit
disputes to arbitration, and are none the less
adverse now that a Bill has beem passed which
takes the matter in hand only after both parties to
the dispute have agreed to submit the matter to
the decision of a third party. The Act isn't worth
the paper it is printed on.
How shall be fought that other Waterloo?
There was he stayed, who would the world enchain,
Madly absorbed with selfish lust of gain,
Careless of misery. For he led the way
That others now adopt—a pirate crew
Who seize the needs of life, and with them make
A meaner warfare : And their fellows stake
As living counters in their wasteful game.
Where are the men, who dare their hearts obey—
Heeding not sullen hate, nor mocking leer—
And rid the world of this more monst rous fear
To give it so, a life of loftier aim?

It may not be generally known that three Water-

These gentlemen, whose united ages tiekrly total three
1 centuries (strictly speaking, 270 years), celebrated the
great victory by a little dinner on the 18th, the
anniversary of Waterloo day. The chair was occupied
by Mr. IF. Adams,, once a trumpeter in the King’s Own

The N.S. W. revenue returns for the past quarter show an increase over those
of the corresponding period of last year. The difference is £194,765. It is pretty
certain that advocates of trade restriction will regard this increase in the
revenue as an unmixed blessing. The introduction of a protective policy will
be credited with having placed the colony on the advantageous footing with
regard to public revenue which it enjoys as compared with most other coloniea
of the Australasian group. To this line of argument two very complete answers
may be given, etc., etc.— Sydney Free-Trade Daily.

A certain Australian actor once quitted the
stage and took to the Law. He was a nice young
man with a cherubic expression and an eye-glass,
and he had played dude parts until a certain haw-
haw had become indelibly fixed in his constitution.
Therefore it came to pass, when he got his first
case, that he rose and delivered himself thus:
“Y’r Honor, I appoah faw the d’fendant in this
case ; its so awf’Jy jawlly, y’r Honor, doncher-
know.” In case of misconception we hasten to
state that this story isn’t true. AVe invented it
ourselves.

And so Melba is really coming to Aus-
tralia ! Here’s Williamson’s card up his sleeve,
though he is not exactly entrepreneur in chief.
And yet papa Dave Mitchell doesn’t look oyer-
pleased. He would prefer to cage this song bird
at Lilydale, or even at Yarraberg, where she used
to play the harmonium, and afterwards oblige at
church on Sundays.

How came English people to adopt the
absurd way of shaking hands now in vogue—with
the arm raised to a level with the shoulder?
Charlie Collette explains; “So many swells now
keep shops, and in shaking hands with their
friends across the counter they are obliged to raise
their arms in that way, and snobs who don’t keep
shops have imitated them.”
* • »
The toadying cablegrams so frequently
inflicted upon us about the English proceedings of a
certain rich Australian who affects British yacht-
ing society are understood to be engineered by
Somers ATne and Co. A T ine, it is remarked in
London, may yet be able to stop his friend from
eating peas with a knife, but he’ll never succeed
in bracing up his pal’s “ aitches.”

Nobody in Queensland accuses the Nor- r
man family of “ side.” The Governor spends his
spare time poking about the river in a canoe, or
strolling around the suburbs in an aimless kind of
way. Lady Norman braces herself up for the
Government ’Ouse ordeal by horse-exercise. They
patronise every local charitable punch-and-judy
show with heroic fortitude. Bometime ago the
Woollongabba “push” got up an entertainment
in aid of a local lame-dog asylum, or something of
that kind. The Governor and his family were
inveigled into being present. They turned up
unostentatiously and innocently, and placidly sat
the thing out. It was a “ rorty ” show too.
It’s getting quite a common tiling for tbe
youthful plaintiff in a seduction case to name the
most respectable hotel she can think of as the.
place where she and the defendant stayed as man
and wife. Then the licensee comes flaring to the
newspapers with a denial that any married couple
stayed at her hotel that night. And people smile
to see how the disclaimer gives itself away.

THE UNEMPLOYED PROCESSION.
(For The Bulletin.)
The melancholy line filed down the street —
Some hundreds, seedy, pale, their wistful eyes
Stared strangely at the well-dressed crowds who
saw
Them pass along, for it was evening ; soon
The actor, clown, and painted girl would play
To please the sneering groups who stood to watch.
And some in front had raised a marching song ;
I closed m-y ears, for ’twas a mockery.
But one stood near, a black, wond’ring, and asked
How ’twas the white men marched at such a time.
And when he heard that some must work or
starve,
He stared as unbelieving, and I thought
How awful that this savage—if he knew—
Might boast —“ Such piteous spectacle was not
Ere white man’s foot was here, for then when food
Was scarce wo starved together. ” And with
shame
I turned away, for all the lines had passed.

Lord llosebill, ex-aido to Gov. Hopetoun,
has come back to Australia with a in his
dressing-bag. He’s an earl now —the Earl of
Northesk. In appearance the young man is the
same strawberry-roan johnnie as of yore, and you
wouldn’t think ho had changed from a plain lord
into a “noble’’lord. But he is. If he were to
commit a felony the common or garden-law
couldn’t touch him —he could claim to be tried by
his peers. The point is worth remembering, not
in connection with this particular aristocrat, who
isn’t likely to commit a felony or anything else
that puts a strain upon the intellect, but as an in-
stance of the remarkable fact that the jury who
could find a man guilty whilst his father lived
couldn’t sit on the case if his noble progenitor
were dead.

George Musgrove, theatrical entrepreneur,
is terribly Piccadilly and New Bond-st. since he
came back this last time. His torso is encased in
a long frock coat, and he keeps his trousers
generally turned up over his patent leathers on
the assumption that it is beastly muddy in Lon-
don. Also, he. wears gloves and a slim umbrella
most religiously. But the tall silk hat doth chiefly
denote that the Musgrovian bosom still beats to
the well-beloved rhythm of Bow Bells. The
shape of that hat is not more eminently respect-
able than the owner’s method of pushing it well
down over his head and keeping it there. Mussy
wears the lofty tile assertively in private boxes at
theatrical matinees and other places where the
unsop h,i s t ioate d
Australian is ad>
d icted to uncover-
ing his skull. He

Unless there be one law for the barristers
and another for clients in Adctoria it is evident
tiiat the genial Purves, Q.C., will have to ante-up
the seventy-thousand-pound baby-heiress, Kath-
leen Macpherson. His only shadow of an excuse
for seizing and sticking to the opulent infant lay
in the fact that her stepfather and legal guardian,
having been lured within the jurisdiction of the
Court, wasn’t domiciled within the blessed juris-
diction aforesaid. And considering that Purves
annexed the Golden Kid almost as soon as she had
beer! landed at Melbourne, there wasn't much
time allowed for the domiciling process anyway.
But now stepfather Barton is legally domiciled in
Melbourne, and intends to domicile there for ever-
more rather than let Purves have possession
of the little ward of Court. How the child came
to be made a ward, and what the dickens right
Purves has to interfere in the matter, are mys-
teries too deep for discussion in a paragraph,
Attorney-General Barton (of N.S.AV.) is much
more nearly related to the glittering Kathleen,
inasmuch as he is uncle to the child’s step father
ami great-uncle to her half-sister—an actual blood-
relation, in fact. Purves’ family interest in the
matter is a sort of Chinese puzzle. His wife’s
mother (when a widow) married the grandfather
of Kathleen when he was a widower, which means
that Kathleen is the grand-daughter of Purves’
wife’s stepfather. If the almighty Q.C. can claim
custody of the child on this evidence, he must
be entitled to assume control of every orphan
asylum in the country.

Tims a correspondent : .
Dear Bulletin,— He your recent paragraph concerning
wife-desertion in its relation to the theatrical profession.
People should be cautious about indiscriminately sym-
pathising with “ deserted ” women. Comparatively few
women who are of any account, or who are not to blame
themselves, are abandoned. Man is so much the creature
of habit, that it takes a good deal in the way of nagging,
drunkenness, or even infidelity, to drive him away from a
woman to whom he has become used. Then, again,
public performers nearly always get had or indifferent
women as wives. It may be almost granted that a woman
who is fascinated by a man because lie paints his face and
goes on the stage, is just as big a fool, and, morally as
worthless as the men who run mad after ballet-girls,
or the youths who make countesses of courtesans.
And, by the way, it is to he hoped that the next (Vic-
torian) judge who tries a divorce-case will not make such
an ass of himself as the last one did by his truly hysterical
and unworldly sympathy with the lady. His Honor said
“it was a pity that a woman separated from her husband
could not have a male friend without suspicion of
adultery.” If this he his Honor’s real opinion I don't
know what sort of notions they have in legal circles
regarding morality, hut the standard of morals in other
society is, no matter what people may say , utterly
different. A decent married woman separated from her
husband dare not have a male friend unless she wishes to
lose her reputation. It may be hard on her but it is one
of the punishments for marrying the wrong husband. It
is also hard on the prisoner in gaol that he can’t stroll
down to the Gardens and hear the hand play, or dine at
Paris House, hut that deprivation is one of the punish-
ments for his mistake whatever it may have been. That
Judge’s sillv remarks have no doubt made much mischief
among some already too frisky matrons. It would be
interesting to see how' the Judge referred to would act if
his own married sister went out to meet men at night
who kissed her on the brow and embraced her at parting ;
also, what he would say when she returned after a three
days’ absence with the vague information that she had
been away with “ a friend.” Understand me: 1 make no
imputation against the lady concerned—save what is
involved in the admitted facts of the case.—Yours, Badly
Bitten.

Dear Bulletin, — I have heard very, very
often that gibe about the women who haunt the
Australian divorce-courts when a particularly
thrilling case is in progress, and have almost to
be removed by violence before tney will quit.
What about the men who do exactly the same
thing, and are not invited to quit at all? If the
case is too offensive for women to listen to, lest
they should be morally infected, I presume men
are allowed to listen because they are so far gone
already that they can’t get infected any worse.
And if the average man is so morally “ high ” that
he is eminently fitted
to haunt the divorce-
court, isn’t he a nice
animal to criticise
woman for being
there also especi-
ally considering that
she isn’t there nearly
so often as he is ?
I would like to hear
some Australian
j udge invite all
gentlemen—including several dozen unattached
barristers—to leave the court when the objec-
tionable evidence is just starting, and then bear
how they would swear outside. —Yours, T. Salt.

Wq passed by Hampden A ilia (Balmain)
the other evening, and. heird the most fearsome
row going on inside that wo ever listened to.
There would be upwards of two hundred dull
thuds, and then a sound as if forty cups and
saucers had been smashed at once, and after that
a series of fearful howls would .split the air, and
somebody could be heard smashing up the key-
board of a piano with an axe. Also a bloodshot
old man drove his white head right through the
front window and threw out a volume of poems
and two handfuls of hair into the front garden.
Then we knew what was the matter. It was
Parkes reading the cablegrams about Dibbs’
success in London, and making comments with a

Parson Laseron, of Sydney, is to be tosti-
monialised with a purse of sovereigns because he
was shot in the back by Walker, M.L. A. The
average preacher can’t drop downstairs without
falling on a testimonial at the bottom. The logic
of tire affair isn’t very clear, however. People
pay to see a comedy because they enjoy it, arid
when they pay to see poor parson Laseron shot
it looks as if they enjoyed it too. If they put up
the money as an evidence that their faith in Mr.
Laseron is unimpaired and that they are sure lie
didn’t deserve to be shot, it is an insult—nobody
even hinted that he deserved to be shot. And if
they mean it as a sign of thankfulness that he
wasn’t shot any worse then they ought to give the
money to Walker, because he didn’t plug the
preacher in a vital-part.

The finding of the jury of four, who by a
three-fourths majority returned a verdict for
defendant in the Sydney breach-of-promise case,
Eitzallan versus Hunt, tried last week, plainly
did not meet with the approval of Judge Wiu-
deyer, who charged strongly in favour of plaintiff,
a rather pretty girl, who knows a thing or two.
For, when the jury returned to Court with the
verdict, after having been locked up some hours,
the Judge snapped out to them something to the
effect that they had been locked up at the instiga-
tion of defendant, who had not expected they
would give bin a verdict. Very likely not —after
such a cock-eyed summing-up. The jury’s
verdict, however little it may suit the deeply-
wronged plaintiff, who wanted .£2OOO as balm for
(sob) her outraged affections, is heartily approved
by the public.

Dear Bulletin, — When
I was in Darlinghurst Prison,
a few weeks ago, a prisoner
told me this melancholy yarn,
which I send you os only (of
course) a prisoner’s statement:
“I have now been in gaol
nearly four years for neglect
to maintain my wife. An
order was made against me by
a magistrate for maintenance ;
I neglected to comply with
it, was brought up, and sent,
to gaol for 12 months, or until
I did comply with it. The
rule is that, after 12 months,
a prisoner has a month’s
liberty in which he is supposed
to be able to earn sufficient
to enable him to comply with
the maintenence order ; if he
does not by that time pay
up arrears, he is sent up
again for a second 12 months,
and so on seriatim. But my
wife has struck a new line.
She has, at her elbow, a
lawyer “joker,” and directly
I leave prison, she swears an
information that I am “about
to leave the colony ” (N.S.W.),
and I am re - arrested and
shopped again. My fourth
year will be up in about 10
days, but, if I am not re-
arrested before I can pet to
the first pub. for a drink, I
shall be before I can swallow
sufficient to ‘ feel comfort-
able.’” Now, Mr. Bulletin,
in the words of the parodied
Shylock—“ Ish dot der law ? ”
—Yours, Ex-Prisoner.

“ A Doctor’s Wife ” thus addresses The
Bulletin
Dear Bulletin, — There have always been wicked and
slanderous people who assert that in the private rooms
set apart for ladies at well-known city restaurants, the
refreshments imbibed are not strictly confined to
lemonade and tea. In fact, it is added, that these inno-
cent if cheerless beverages, are seldom called for. It is a
mystery known only to the initiated why a tiny tray of
coffee-bsans should find a place on all the small tallies.
The hour before noon is as good a time as any to call in
and take some mild refreshment in the privacy of “ the
ladies’ room.” The visitors then will be found to be of
the mixed types so favourable for observation. It must
be borne in mind that the matrons and maids who
drop in and indulge in “a peg” are of respectability
and good standing. No demi-mondaine would show
her face twice within the doorway. The thing
that most astonishes a newcomer is the calm way
in which girls, scarcely over 20, will toss off one,
and sometimes two, brandies-and-soda with ail the
equanimity of old hands. In point of fact, it is mostly
the young women who indulge in spirits, the elder ones
have their honest bottle of beer or stout ! The timid
novice, as a rule, asks hesitatingly for “ a glass of wine”
on her first visit, but she soon learns to take her nip like
a man, or rather, a woman. Still, for a long time, she
finds it necessary to explain to a friend that she has been
busy shopping, and that Dr. has told her that she
must take a little stimulant when she feels fatigued.
Sometimes there is a little shamefacedness visible when a
girl with a b.-and-s. before her recognises a friend whom
she is not particularly anxious to be seen by ; but mutual
explanations as to the cause of their requiring a little
refreshment soon smooth matters over, and they “ take
their glass ” sociably in company. Whisky is not, either
in Sydney or Melbourne, such a favourite drink as brandy
amongst the frequenters of the ladies’ room. Whether the
girls have taken their ideas from novels, written
by women, wherein the naughty characters all drink
brandy-and-soda, and sometimes, in moments of excite-
ment, half a tumbler of brandy neat, it is hard to say ;
but the fact remains that, given the same number of men,
whisky would almost invariably be the liquor in demand.
A favourite plan is to have the spirit brought in a hock-
glass, to make believe that it isn’t hie. How many of
these embryo topers develope into secret drinkers in
middle-age it would be hard to say. That the habit of
“nipping” is not going to be any longer monopolised by
men is evident at a glance ; and what is also evident is
the fact that most of them, young as they are, know how
to “ carry their liquor.” Occasionally a flushed face has
to be toned down by a dropped veil, and a voice ordinarily
“ soft and low ” begins to gallop at an unusual rate ; but,
as a rule, these—mostly upper-crust damsels—can swallow
their brandy-and-soda with as little effect on their outward
demeanour as their brothers would experience—perhaps
less. None of them reach the “jolly good fellow ” stage,
and no one, to meet them in the street, would imagine
that they had partaken of anything stronger than the
most innocent of drinks. There are some neat pen and-
ink pictures to be obtained in “the ladies’ room,” which
may be worth drawing some day. I have a neat two
columns in my mind’s eve.

“ The way she lifts her leg,” says he,
“Is grand, but O! you ought to see
My Tottie lift her elbow.”
Watch Your Nose!
Already the claim is made that one’s disposition
is outlined by his nose. According to the Buffalo
Commercial, large nostrils show courage. People
of fearless dispositions breathe fully and freely.
All the fiercer animals have dilated nostrils. The
drooping nostril shows histrionic talent. If the
nose also droops, it denotes a tragic power, and if
only the nostril the capacity is marked for the
interpretation of comedy. When the nose is thin
at the bridge it shows generosity, while a nose
that is thick at the bridge argues inquisitiveness.
When it is “ tip-tilted like the petal of a flower ”
the person is inquisitive. A projecting nose
argues a disposition to investigate. It is ahead of
the person as it were, and wants to scent out
things. Look at your nose in the glass and see
what sort of a person you are, any way. If your
nose is blue you have a bad circulation, if very
pale you are suffering from poverty of blood, if
full of blackheads, which you can squeeze out,
your blood is impure, if your nose has a rod color,
it may have cost you a lot of money to have got
up that beautiful brilliancy, and it may also cost
you a great deal still to keep it in repair; in either
case you are a victim of aggravated indigestion
caused by the liberties you take with your stomach
and liver, and must have immediate recourse to
that great regulator of all diseased conditions,
known as Clements Tonic, which, so far, has
never failed to cure a single case where it has been
given a fair chance. Follow the example of G.
Alexander Tather, Esq., 198 Myers-street, Gee-
long, Vic., who says : “It is a very pleasing duty
for me to convey to you the facts of the great
benefit that has accrued to me through taking
Clements Tonic. For the last two years I have
suffered very severely from indigestion, flatulence,
and I think every other horror appertaining there-
to, being subject to great uneasiness and retching
after meals, especially after dinner, which meal I
had to discontinue altogether, the nasty sensation
and retching depressed me so much. I tried
many of the advertised cures without benefit, but
on reading of a case (cured by Clements Tonic)
similar to my own, I resolved to give the same
remedy a trial, and, after taking three bottles, the
uneasy feeling and retching were entirely cured ;
and I shall not fail to make it known as widely as
possible in the Geelong district, where I reside,
and trust it may be the means of relieving others
so afflicted.”


Judge Brain well : “ Prisoner at the bar—
after a lengthy trial, you have been convicted
of” Prisoner ’Ow much ?” Judge: “Nine
months.”
A Victorian policeman unsuccessfully
appealed, the other day, against an order for the
maintenance of his illegitimate child. The judge
said there was a prima facie case of perjury on his
part, and made some apt remarks on the extra
value attached to a constable’s oath.
Never write a letter to a girl without first
considering how it will sound when a grinning
barrister reads it out in court. The following, pro-
duced in a recent breach of promise case, points a
moral: —
I could never take a secondary, washed-out course of
affection. I bring you a contrite heart. lam as pure as
a thistle-down. Oh, Jdne, Ido believe in the power of a
few to pour out their souls, and blessed are those few. It
is they, child, who live. The masses only exist. What
bliss in so doing ! What rapture 1 What celestial joy !
Attraction must be centred in a mother, and what means
a mother? A woman, a helpmate of man ; not a toy for
the hour, but his equal—but still a helpmate, a phantom
of delight, his second self, his companion, friend, adviser,
encourager, comforter, wife.
Brutal guffaws in court! Verdict for <£2so and

bride when he got home !

WILLIAM JOHN LYNE.
“That Little Cold.”
At the present time the weather is most change-
able, and nearly everyone suffers from colds in the
hehd or throat. These affections in their primary
state are never very hurtful to the constitution,
but a neglected cold is one of the worst things
that can ever happen to a human being, It
should certainly bo attended to immediately.
Warmer clothing must be put on, and the patient
must undergo a slight course of a medicine which
will cure in the early stages and not allow the
sufferer to become afflicted with those most
prevalent complaints—ASTHMA, CONSUMP-
TION and BRONCHITIS.
What a number of persons have cause to regret
a neglected simple little cold, and if they had only
thought it was going to turn out as it has done
they would certainly have taken the PROPER
PRECAUTIONS. But still it is not too late,
and why? Because NATURE, which provides
everything necessary to existence, in her bounty
has given us herbs and vegetation amongst which
is hidden the antidotes to sickness, and it only
required the research of such a lady as MOTHER
AUBERT to discover the plants which yield the
articles of assimilation in curbing the ills brought
on by a slight cold.
“ Marupa ”
Is the registered name of MOTHER AUBERT’S
GOUGH. ASTHMA and CONSUMPTION
REMEDY.
It is a medicine which should be in every house-
hold, and testimony has been given by hundreds
of persons of its good effects. Notably MR.
WALTER BENTLEY and MISS MYRA
KEMBLE, whoso vocation brings them under
the notice of everybody “who runs and reads,’’
would not have certified to the efficacy of
“ Marupa ”
If it was not what it is made out to be.
There are no mineral substances in its compos!*
tion, and almost for that reason alone it is not
hurtful to the smallest child, but can be admin-
istered with perfect safety.
Mothers, attend to that distressing cough of
your little offspring and send for a bottle of
“ Marupa,”
And have cause to rejoice that in future years
your children grow up with CHEEKS LIKE
ROSES and not with PALLID LIPS because
“THAT LITTLE COLD” was neglected in
younger days.
*
Karana.
WHEN the digestive organs are out of order
a good reliable tonic is required to bring
them back to their normal state.
A number of persons upset the stomach by
neglecting to take their meals at regular stated
intervals, and others again eat to excess at some
particular meal and from these causes the
machinery gets out of order and does not run
smoothly. Late suppers, also, are one of the
causes of upsetting the digestive organs.
Sister Mary Joseph Aobert, in her researches
amongst the plants of New Zealand, has dis-
covered there is a very Valuable remedy for these
complaints in our own vegetation, and, after
experimenting for a number of years, has now
brought forward the medicine called
Karana.
Dr. Larochette, a chemist of the First Class
of the Faculty of Paris, to whom samples were
sent, says : —“ It is an excellent bitter tonic, and
I consider it even superior to the preparation of
Cinchona in all affections of the stomach. It has
given us, prepared as you sent it, the most satis-
factory results.” ■
The Reverend Sister says she has used it for
many years extensively and successfully with
sufferers of every age and constitution, and she
noticed that in a few cases it did not agree at
first* but by diminishing the dose good results
followed. She remarked astonishing good results
on old people, who had ruined their constitutions
by the abuse of intoxicating drink, and who were
debilitated and suffering after having turned over
a new leaf.
Paramo
Is a splendid medicine for complaints of the
Liver and kidneys.

HE DID'NT ANTSCIPATE
TRORBLE
AN amorous couple on the verge of committing
matrimony entered a Paddington ’bus the
other night, and oblivious of the presence of a
third passenger, who to all appearances was enjoy-
ing a comfortable nap in the top corner, com-
menced billing and cooing in dead earnest. Of
course the conversation turned upon the subject
of their approaching nuptials, and many were the
expressed anticipations of the joy that awaited
them in that estate which all are anxious to enter
into and not a few would be glad to obtain release
from. “All,” whispered the fair one, suppressing
a mild hysterical sob, “ what a pleasure it will be
for me to listen to all your troubles and share all
your griefs.” ‘ But, darling,” rejoined the hope-
ful Romeo, “ I have no griefs nor troubles.”
“Ob, but you will have plenty, you know, when
wo arc married,” added she, with ingenuous
emphasis. The passenger in the corner coughed,
and a silence followed that would have tipped
down the scale at £OO pounds. The prospective
benedict assumed a thoughtful mood. Up to that
moment he had regarded marriage as an unmixed
blessing—a path strewn with roses—not even once
pausing to think of the discomfort attending a
pair of feminine cold feet, of an icy reception
after a late night at the lodge or club, of a colicky
baby with leathern lungs and a voice like the
shrillest of steam whistles, or of bruised and
lacerated fingers, the combined result of unskilful-
ness, a blunt tomahawk, and a chunk of knotty
firewood. These, however, are among the little
troubles that the average young man undertaking
one of the great responsibilities of life must look
out for, and the best thing for him to do to
soothe the self-inflicted injuries of inexperience,
and to prevent the attack of chill or rheumatism
which shooting by night at lightning speed out of
a warm bed, and rushing wildly along linoleum-
covered passages in quest of paregoric will inevit-
ably bring, is always to have in the house ready
for use a supply of St. Jacobs Oil, the great con-
queror of all pain. Mr. John Breakwell, of
Milson’s Point-road, North Sydney, gratefully
acknowledges ; “I have suffered severely for some
years from rheumatism in my knees, and have
tried many remedies. I have found St. Jacobs
Oil give me great relief, and am pleased to speak
in praise of it.”

I had been troubled five months
with Dyspepsia. The doctors told
me it was chronic. I had a fullness
after eating and a heavy load in the
pit of my stomach. I suffered fre-
quently from a Water Brash of clear
matter. Sometimes a deathly Sick-
ness at the Stomach would overtake
me. Then again I would have the
terrible pains of Wind Colic. At
such times I would try to belch and
could not. . I was working then for
Thomas McHenry, Druggist, Cor.
Irwin and Western Ave., Allegheny
City, Pa., in whose employ I had
been for seven years. Finally I used
August Flower, and after using just
one bottle for two weeks, was en-
tirely relieved of all the trouble. I
can now eat things I dared not touch
before. I would like to refer you to
Mr. McHenry, for whom I worked,
who knows all about my condition,
and from whom I bought the medi-
cine. I live with my wife and family
at 39 James St., Allegheny City, Pa.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The Grand National meeting opens at 11cm-
jnjjlon, on Saturday', and a mild, half-hearied desire to
“pickup the double” is manifesting itself amongst a
community that would bo very glad to pick up a six-
pence with a hole in it just at present. The betting-
mark J, I bus far, has supplied no valuable information con-
cerning the big hurdle race, and if I lie information given
al the finish is no more valuable than it was last year,
win nail the favouritis came in at the wrong end covered
with more mud than glory, it won’t be worth having,any-
way. The Millers have the gigantic Redleap and
Norbert, either of which might win—especially the latter,
because it is so generally stated that the horse
jo-gn’t jump kindly. A horse that doesn’t jump
well on paper is frequently a perfect devil to fly the
sticks in his stride. The Pioneer, a common-looking
animal and bad performer on the flat, is ostensibly
“fancied” by Sam Cooke, also Ilavilah, from Scobie’s
stable, at Ballarat, presents the hazy appearance cf “a
rod in pickle.” Properly backed at the post, Ilavilah
ought to finish near the front indeed—if he doesn’t fall
ami break Ills neck in the meantime. An outside chance,
Abergyle, jumps well, and he might win ; hut, taking one
consideration with another, The Bulletin inclines to the
opinion that “ the field ” is a good horse which generally
just ill-s the confidence of the hook-nosed Hebrew who
backs it.
# # #
On Tuesday, July 12th, a race-meeting for the
benefit of the Melbourne unemployed will be held at
Caulfield. All the officials have volunteered their ser-
vices gratis, the horses are determined to run straight for
this occasion only, and the free-list will, it is hoped, be
suspended by general consent. Even Lord Hopetoun and
suite have announced their gracious desire to pay for
admission, just as though they were ordinary mortals, so
perhaps the newspaper proprietors will forego the usual
charge for advertisements and purchase tickets for their
sporting representatives. We say, “perhaps.’*
* * *
Strathmore, on last year’s running in the same
race and subsequently, is the best handicapped of all the
t qi weights for the Melbourne Cup, although the public
will probably take Zalinski for choice it the two stable
companions come fit to the post—which is not very likely
1 1 happen. Another attractive article is Malolo, a second
edition of his sire (Malua) in appearance, and weighted at
two stone less than Strathmore and Malvolio. The Mel-
bourne Cup is yet a long way off, however. This time
l,st year people were talking of Carbine, Vengeance,
Dreadnought, and Melos, and not one of the four gave
the punters a run for their money.
# * »
The Cup conditions as regards three-year-olds
need amending. Experience shows that the weight-for-
age scale in the spring, over two miles, is not equitable
as concerns the horses of that age. Look at the anomaly,
too, of a crack two-year-old being weighted at Sst. in the
Cup, when there is every chance of his defeat in the
Derby, the winner of which, most likely the best colt of
the year, is only asked to carry 7st. 61b. It happened in
Titan’s case, and will happen again. The scale ought to
slide down if it ho just that it slide up.
# # *
Noah Beal, the oldest trainer in Australasia,
has a couple of Cup candidates in Forty Winks and
Penance—a possible two-Cup double. Penance, 7st. 711*.,
is supposed to be reserved for the big event. He once
gave Slromlioli a stone and a beating, and ran Carbine a
great race, weight-for-age. Forty Winks was well up last
Melbourne Cup, third in Australian and Sydney Cups,
and beat a good field in the Autumn Handicap, carrying
lib. less than he has in Caulfield Cup.
* * *
The A. J.C. has called upon the Surprise party
(Surprise is a c wintry horse, of course) for an explanation
of their running at Moorefield the other day. There are
two men on the committee who will surely not have the
“ neck ” to adjudicate in this case.
• # *
Re Team, owner of Malvolio, is dimly sus-
pected of having hacked his big moke for the next Cup a
fortnight before the weights were due. The hookies had
the cast-iron gdl to offer an extravagant 20 to I against
Malua’s son 10 days ago !
* * *
About once in every three months, more or less,
Skinner, a Melbourne hotel-keeper and racecourse refresh-
ment caterer, is robbed of a big bag of money. The
remorseless eye of the football barrackor and sporting
jnafer is ever on Skiimerand his hags of money, and as an
object of plunder he grow s monotonous.

The lucky Richmond (Vie.) baker who scooped
“Tatt.’s ” last Melh. Cup sweep w ith Malvolio, is laying

One of the sights of Melbourne streets after a
race meeting is Barney Allen and bis wondrous riding
pants. Tney fit him like Dauby’s in “Cinder-Ellen.”
When Barney returned from his trip “ ’Onie” ho took to

Ins example is being followed by his brother books. So
far, none have fallen off.

“Lilly” Elott showed himself to bo the
“Tommy ” Hales of the trotting track, at Sydney Driving
Park on Wednesday week. At no time was the hub of

Humphrey Oxenham, “King of the Ring,”
doesn't approve of tolalisators and consultations—any
move than Faroes approves of Dibbs. But the man who
carried the prize pumpkin gets near the truth in saying
that one race-day weekly would he ample for Sydney.
The sooner this is realised the better.

“Jumbo” Walker, once the pride of Sydney

The president of a backblocks racing club had a
horse in the Selling Race, “and put him in the bag,” a
bookie standing in. One of the stewards hearing this
went to the three other jockeys and promised them a
fiver each to lose. Then he got a caution administered to
the rider of the stiff. The latter had to win, and owner
and bookmaker lost heavily'.

The one man of letters in Sydney Tattersajl’s
billiard tournament (Jim Hogue, editor of E. News) held
his own well against the men of figures, but one of the
latter in the final, aided by luck, managed to score a
victory. Next time the game ought to be 300 up at least,
so that the men on scratch or behind it have a chance.
Last time Lyons was asked to owe 60, and some of the
contestants had less than 100 to make.

Singer of things to be-
gad with a thousand wrongs,
Strong as the surging sea.
AA'ild as a wind (lint sweeps
Out of the dappled dawn,
Over a world that sleeps,
Dreaming of life new born.
Fling us a song afloat
Up to the skies above,
Passion in every note—
Human with burning love—
Brotherly love, and oh,
Waken the theme anew,
Sung in the long ago
Under the Syrian blue.
So as the winds and tide
Waken the slumh’ring main,
Here in the light denied
Life may awake again.
This is the hour of time,
This is the day of days ;
Sing us a song sublime—
Sing us a Marseillaise !

To extract the fact of an anti-labour state-
ment from a capitalistic daily, divide by 50; or
multiply an admission in favour of labour by a

The big Frankston (Vic.) Cemetery, which
is as yet a gruesome dream of the future, will
perhaps see the last of earth-to-earth funerals
from the Melbourne district. A piece of country
12 miles in circumference has been pegged out
there for “Christian” burials, anyway, and
although the rapid filling up of metropolitan
cemeteries must eventually drive all the trade to
Frankston, the demand for freehold allotments
will so diminish that the whole 12-mile area may
never be taken up. Cremation is in the air, and
a gigantic bakehouse for the benefit of right think-
ing corpses is already talked about. The manager
of St. Kilda grave ground has brought a charming
little model of a crematorium, fitted with all the
latest improvements, under the august notice of
his Board, and the Board saw that it was
good. Several of the members decided to be
burned on the spot, or rather they decided
on the spot that they would like flames, in-
stead of worms, to consume their cadavers.
Two or three Victorian Judges have hinted
an intention to go straight out for cremation in
their wills, the model aforementioned having
touched their hearts. To understand the working
of the new system is to become its advocate,
unless, indeed, you hug' the belief that worms
never attack dead ’unsof good position, or, again,
unless you cherish the notion that the immortal
soul is a kind of spiritual sweetbread all traces of
which might get lost amongst the ashes in the
oven. The days of the heavy polished-oak coffin
are numbered (for the crematorium body-gear is
necessarily of the lightest wood), and the dying
poet who talks of sleeping with the daisies on his
breast will soon be talking an anachronism.

Some years ago Jack S , resident in a
large N.S.W. town, a notorious practical joker
and a man of great shrewdness and natural ability,
having become insolvent, had to appear in person
before the examining Judge in Insolvency. When
his name was called, Jack wandered sheepishly
around the court and had to be placed in position
by an official to whom, with an air of mock sim-
plicity, he said, “ Thank you, your worship.”
Jack pretended he did not see the Judge, and
when that functionary asked him what explana-
tion he had to make of his bankruptcy he turned
hastily round and replied with a startled look,
“ I’m guilty, your Honor, I plead guilty.” The
Judge proceeded to inform him that he was not
called upon to plead at all, when he broke in with
great earnestness, “ I’m guilty, your Honor, I
know I’m guilty.” The Judge here peremptorily
demanded a detailed explanation of the causes
leading to his insolvency, but failed to elicit any-
thing from the examinee but “ I’m guilty, your
Honor, I plead guilty.” A threat to commit him
for contempt did not shake Jack, who meekly
responded, “Yes, your Honor, I’m guilty.” At
last the Judge completely lost patience and said
angrily, “ Why, this man is an absolute fool, and
people who trusted him in business matters deserve
to lose their money.” Certificate granted. Where-
upon Jack again chipped in with, “ I’m guilty, your
Honor. I’ll come up there alongside you and tell
you all about it”—making a feint of getting up
beside the Judge, who immediately ordered his
removal from the court. Outside Jack met an
insolvent acquaintance whose case happened to
be next on the list. “ How did you get on,” asked
he of the joker. “ Oh, great! ” said Jack, “ I
just pleaded guilty to everything the Judge said,
and kept on pleading and he gave me my ticket
straightaway. You try it.” “I will,” said Jack’s
friend, who happened to be as simple as Jack was
deep, and who when brought before the court
followed Jack’s instructions exactly and began to
plead guilty at every turn. “ Were you present
at the previous examination ?” said the Judge.
The insolvent, instead of answering directly,
merely ejaculated, “I’m guilty, your Honor.”
The Judge now appeared to suspect that S
was not so foolish as ho pretended, and that the
insolvent under examination had been led the
success of S ’s strategy into following his
example. So he suspended his certificate for six
months, and informed him that he felt very much
inclined to commit him for contempt of court.

“ The Life and Adventures of Jorgen Jor-
gensen ” has just been published by a Hobart firm,
much of it being re-written from Jorgensen’s auto-
biography as it appeared in the Van Diemen's
Land Annual of 1835 and 1838. The key-note of
Jorgensen’s downfall was, according to his written
statement, a blind passion for gambling.

There is somewhat to be learnt from the
Paris funeral system. It is all farmed out to a
monopoly, which clears 30 per cent, profit, though
it gives the poor decent gx-atis burials, to the
number of two-fifths of the whole. Considering
this, on the luxury of woe, what must be the
profits of the Melbourne and Sydney Mr. Moulds?
No other spirit is equal to Wolfe’s Schnapps
W. P. Simons of yore, “Ragpicker,”
father of “ Gilhooley,” is incidentally mentioned

“ Trotters ” and “ Humbling ”as dialoguists. Ile
filled up by reporting, and used to collogue with
the Age and Morning Herald reporters in
Collins-street of a Saturday morning, saying,
“ What’s the use of three strong men going up for
the gaol-returns ?” But, somehow, “Ragpicker”
was never the man who went up.

It might not be difficult for many readeis
to recognise a portrait of the old Melbourner we
will call Goole, who lived on Masonic dinners.
Poor as a rat, he preserved his dress-suit, as an in-
dispensable tool of trade, well saved, but not a
world too wide for his shrunken stomach, because it
never shrunk. He sniffed out evei’y dinner of the
mystic tie. As regularly as Banquo at Macbeth’s
feast, he was there. Brethren said, like Macbeth,
“ We only miss our dear brother Goole ’’—and his
Ally Sloper nose came round the edge of the door.
Nothing in modern times has been so copied as
Wolfe’s Schnapps. Beware of imitations.
Writes a London correspondent:—The
day after the Australian mail arrives in London
numberless Bulletin paragraphs are annexed and
published in the evening papers without the
slightest acknowledgement. Many scribblers thus
obtain a name as authorities on Australian affairs.
You must not altogether blame the editors, for
these pars, are re-written and palmed off as
original, and a hard-worked man cannot read
every paper to know where the “crib” comes
from. These literary thieves remind me always of
the story of the late Lord Lamington (or his
father, 1 forget which). Somebody asked him
where the celebrated monastery La Trappe was,
to which he replied that he had not the faintest
idea. His friend then commenced to quote a long
account of his Lordship’s visit to what he had
designated the living tomb ; how one saw the
brothers passing each other without exchanging a
word, whilst in some part of the grounds one^ of
them might be seen digging his own grave. The
noble Lord could only say : “ I assure you I have
never been there in my life.” “Do you mean to
say,” asked his questioner, “that you did not
write that article which is published in your
name?” “Oh, by the way,” said he, “now I
remember, I did, but I never was at the place. I
wrote it from something I saw in Galignani.”
Which was anticipating a good deal of modern
journalism.

At first £30,000 was asked, but now it is said

Able-bodied seamen’s wages at Hobart
(Tas.) have been reduced from £5 a month to
£3 10s. ditto. InNewcastle (N.S.W.) the miners
have had their wages lowered sadly, but some of
the mine-owners still grab 20 per cent, dividend.
In fact, the wages are lowered in order to preserve
the shareholders’ kidney-fat. The same old pitiful
refrain runs in all these plaints—“ The men
refused to accept the reduction, but their places
were soon filled.”
After all lias been said, the chief crime
committed by George Black, M.L.A., plaintiff in
the libel-action, Black v. Norton, consists in his
having for so many years, alike in prosperity and
adversity, stood by the woman after taking the
false step—just as the chief crime committed by a
more eminent politician consists in having married
his mistress instead of “casting away his sin,”
i.e., abandoning her to her own resources. Black,
however, practically lost his case on account
of the savage and blistering vituperation impru-
dently launched by him at Norton in response to
the latter’s attacks, and of the adroitness with
which the jury were prejudiced against him for
his Anti-Royalist, Republican, and Agnostic
utterances.
The real reason of the chronic hostility
displayed by the British Press whenever a new

the fact that dfar increased expenditure is not
sufficiently tended to keep the British manufac-
turing exporter to the front.
Against the Labour movement in Queens-
land the united forces of Parliament, pulpit and
press are closing in. No one outside knows how
bitter the struggle is—the hatred and oppression
of one side, and the silent, sullen endurance of the
other. It looks, sometimes, as though Queensland
will yet be the Labour Marathon.

G. H. Reid, who announced on behalf of
N.S.W. Opposition an anti-Dibbs crusade which
is never to cease until the Ministry are forced to
the country, was very severe on Attorney-General
Barton when the latter unfolded the Ministerial
policy ip “a hole-and-corner way ” at the little
village of Manly, instead of before his East
Sydney constituents. Now, Mr. Reid (who also
represents East Sydney) instead of speaking there
hies himself to the dead town of Liverpool, most
of the inhabitants of which are in the local
Benevolent Asylum.
The farmer-in-town, when perfectly sober,
is generally a joyless animal, but if he will only
visit the splendid agricultural implement estab-
lishment of Messrs. Howard, Pitt-street, Sydney,
he will have untold comfort administered to his
bush-hardened, sun-baked soul. What strikes the
visitor as he wends his way through the fine show-
room with the first-rate assortment of ploughs,
harrows, and general agricultural implements
neatly arranged on either side, all fitted out with
the latest and best improvements, is the wonderful
progress that this firm has made—on the principle,
no doubt, that worth must tell. Steel-binders,
improved mowers, horse-rakes, chaff-cutters, Dix
harrows, Clayton-Shuttleworth portable engines,
and ploughs adapted to different kinds of soil, are
all there, and the experienced eye of the farmer
sees in them visions of coming wealth. At ene
end of the offices, with their beautiful American
walnut fittings, may be seen Mr. J. C. Howard,
engaged in his extensive correspondence; Mr.
Chas. Howard is everywhere, giving to customers
the benefit of his practical knowledge in their
purchases. Visitors may reckon on a courteous
reception from Manager Costie.
The public is an ass. Another strike at
Broken Hill, owners and miners quarrelling,
never thinking that the community pays the piper
in the long run. Strikes are barbarous. Arbitra-
tion spells civilization and the public, the third
and principal party to all conflicts, should exercise
its power and say strikes shall not be. Likewise
the man who wants protection without ruination
should keep valuable documents, jewellery and
cash in the Sydney Safe Deposit.*

They Met at the Morgue.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“On Thursday last there met at the Morgue an old
couple of apparently 60 years of age who separated by
mutual consent 40 years ago, the day after landing from
England, the wife going into service and he taking up a
piece of country land. Hearing of her illness he started
to see her, but died in the train and was removed to the
Morgue, where his wife had been taken the day before.”—
Melbourne Evening Paper.
“Now,” my friend said, “if you have finished
lunch I will show you a slice of real tragedy.” So
we made for the Morgue and in 10 minutes were
flattening our noses against the
Screen of glass we’re thankful for.
On the other side the six slate slabs supported
their loads of wrecked humanity—the flotsam and
jetsam of life’s boisterousness. A block of wood
beneath the head of each played the part of
pillow, and the dripping Yan Yean did duty for
tears.
At the far end lay the dead body of a child
which had lived but six hours ; a piece of tape tied
tightly about its throat told the story of a mother’s
anguish, and the child’s death, and on the slab
next lay the mother herself. “ I should not have
known they were mother and child, sir,” the
attendant said, “but for the two pieces of tape
being alike ; then it all came out, and I put them
next each other.” On the adjoining slabs, and
close together, lay the objects of our mission—an
old couple, withered and life-weary, with faces
across which Trouble had engraved his sign-
manual too deeply for death to erase. They were
both over sixty, and, I thought, singularly alike.
“Years and years ago,” my friend said, “that
woman there—toothless and furrow-browed—was
the beauty of my father’s parish, admired and
flirted with by every man, from the squire down.
I) cantering to the meet, would stop at her
mother’s cottage, and beg a flower from her, and the
parson himself had been seen to chuck her under
the chin. Molly was an institution—somehow it
became neither sin nor scandal to love her. She
took butter round and left at each house smiles
and a sense of gladness with it. Don’t look at
her !—time belies everything—nor at me, and I’ll
•ontinue.
“ Molly gave me flowers until she got my heart
by way of payment, and then, as kittens do with
babies’toys, she played havoc with it—the wild,
wayward child of natu.ro rolled about with me on
the mossy banks of her own woods, pelted me
with primroses and buried me in blue bells until,
without her, life became grey and purposeless—
nor there, in the sanctity of Nature’s self,' had
modern moralities hold of us. Each to the other
grew transparent simultaneously, and we were all
natural and quite holy in the free forest, where
weeds could not grow nor sin exist —in that it was
mi manured of club gossip or women’s curiosity.
I think when I look back at those days, and
rein ember how the boisterous ecstasy of our mere
iving would now quiet down into the golden smt-
s «t of an hour of love and confidence—only to live
?p vin and awaken the woods with laughter—that
ne very gods must have envied and instanced us
ev ffl e,Ki e of life’s possibilities. But even Molly’s
joods were not sacred from the Goddess of Ven-
geance, who one night led my father there. We,
rouchmg together beneath the bushes, caught
ne sound of mumbling in the distance —it grew
s ? er a °d nearer until we heard the words tnem-
ves. It was my father preparing the morrow’s
i-nnon. He was practising his peroration, and
the sentences have burnt themselves into my
memory; “And the everlasting decree of nature
that has echoed down through the ages is, ‘ There
is no peace, saith my God for the wicked.’ ” And
then he was upon us, and stood over us in the
moonlight—and grew old. Molly had jumped to
her feet and stood with her back to him, motion-
less and statuesque. I bent my head only and
felt afraid, while he, my good father, took the
truth down with an audible gulp, turned on his
heels and left us without a word.
“ The next morning my father sent for me, and
there in his study and in the stately verbosity of
an English country parson, he sentenced me to a
year’s transportation to Germany—where I was
to forget Molly and regain my social status.
“ I came back at the end of the year to find that
my people, for my sake, had induced Molly to
marry the groom and emigrate with him to
Australia.
“ Harry, the groom, was the last man for Molly
to marry. My father had endeavoured to mix
incompatibles—Harry’s ferret-loving, dog-train-
ing, stable-bred autocracy with thenature-endowed
gentility of this‘queen of the rosebud garden of
girls.’
“The result was that on the voyage out they
quarrelled irrevocably. The girl, in her last and
only letter to me, said : ‘ Harry triesso hard to be
good to me, but I cannot live with him. I cannot
love him, 1 don’t know why, unless it is because I
cannot forget you—the old wood at home—and
our evenings there.’ And so, forty years ago,
when they landed here, they parted. Finally, he
went to the bush and took up a small holding,
and she went into service.
“‘And the years indignant worked their will.’
Molly faded away into a machine for the cooking
of chops, her old beauty died out, the sourness of
life and its disappointments converted her from
the wayward wildflower I knew her into a lemon
born out of due season, and he moped himself
into a misanthrope—dug potatoes, felled timber,
and cursed bullocks till the district and its chil-
dren looked upon him as a thing to be avoided.
Six weeks ago Molly broke a blood-vessel and
her mistress, in return for years of slavery, carted
her to the Melbourne Hospital—and there she
would have died had not a kindly visitor
removed her into lodgings and advertised
for her husband, whom she had seen but
four times since her arrival in Port Phillip.
For a great longing had seized the shrivelled
heart of her to see Harry once more and “ make
it up,” and he on his death-bed in his cottage in
Gippsland read the advertisement, and putting on
his old, threadbare black coat started for Mel-
bourne.
On the day he left his home, Molly died, and
was that afternoon brought here, and he, when he
heard of it, died also, and was given the next slab,
and so they met, you see, after all.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I am back from up the country—very sorry that I
went
Seeking for the Southern poets’ land whereon to
pitch my tent;
I have lost a lot of idols, which were broken on
the track —
Burnt a lot of fancy verses, and I’m glad that I
am back.
Further out may be the pleasant scenes of which
our poets boast,
But I think the country’s rather more inviting
round the coast—
Anyway, I’ll stay at present at a boarding-house
in town
Drinking beer and lemon-squashes, taking baths
and cooling down.
Sunny plains ! Great Scot! —those burning wastes
of barren soil and sand
With their everlasting fences stretching out across
the land !
Desolation where the crow is ! Desert ! where
the eagle flies,
Paddocks where the luny bullock starts and stares
with redden’d eyes ;
Where, in clouds of dust enveloped, roasted
bullock-drivers creep
Slowly past the sun-dried shepherd dragged
behind his crawling sheep.
Stunted “peak” of granite gleaming, glaring!
like a molten mass
Turned, from some infernal furnace, on a plain
devoid of grass.
Miles and miles of thirsty gutters—strings of
muddy waterholes
In the place of “shining rivers ” (walled by cliffs
and forest boles).
“ Range !” of ridges, gullies, ridges, barren ! where
the madden’d flies—
Fiercer than the plagues of Egypt—swarm about
your blighted eyes !
Bush! where there is no horizon! where the
buried bush man sees
Nothing. Nothing! but the madding sameness of
the stunted trees !
Lonely hut where drought’s eternal—suffocating
atmosphere—
Where the God forgotten hatter dreams of city-
life and beer.
Treacherous tracks that trap the stranger, endless
roads that gleam and glare,
Dark and evil-looking gullies—hiding secrets here
and there!
Dull, dumb flats and stony “rises,” where the
bullocks sweat and bake,
And the sinister “gohanna,” and the lizard, and
the snake.
Land of day and night—no morning freshness,
and no afternoon,
For the great, white sun in rising brings with him
the heat of noon.
Dismal country for the exile, when the shades
begin to fall
From the sad, heart-breaking sunset, to the new-
chum, worst of all.
Dreary land in rainy weather, with the endless
clouds that drift
O’er the bushman like a blanket that the Lord
will never lift—
Dismal land when it is raining—growl of floods
and oh ! the “ woosh ”
f the rain and wind together on the dark bed of
the bush —
Ghastly fires in lonely humpies where the granite
rocks are pil’d
In the rain-swept wildernesses that are wildest of
the wild.
Land where gaunt and haggard women live alone
and work like men,
Till their husbands, gone a-droving, will return to
them again—
Homes of men ! if homes had ever such a God-
forgotten place,
Where the wild selector’s children fly before a
stranger’s face.
Horae of tragedy applauded by the dingoes’ dismal
yell,
Heaven of the shanty-keeper —fitting fiend for
such a hell —
And the wallaroos and wombats, and, of course,
the “ curlew’s call ”
And the lone sundowner tramping ever onward
thro’ it all!
I am back from up the country—up the country
where I went
Seeking for the Southern poets’ land whereon to
pitch my tent;
I have left a lot of broken idols out along the
track,
Burnt a lot of fancy verses—and I’m glad that I
am back —
I believe the Southern poet’s dream will not be
realised
Till the plains are irrigated and the land is
humanised.
I intend to stay at present—as I said before—in
town
Drinking beer and lemon-squashes—taking baths
and cooling down.

Necessity is the father of the half-caste.—
Kanaka proverb.
The world’s production of silver has in-
creased yearly, without interruption from
03,000,000 ounces in 1873 to 141,000,000 ounces in
1801, which represents somewhere about 125 per
cent, in 18 years. The United States output,
which has been augmented by some 115 per cent.,
will probably diminish shortly unless the Bimetal-
lists carry the day in the coming elections. By
getting leading producers to believe that a lucra-
tive market would be found for all the silver they
could raise abandoned mines were reworked with
renewed energy. Now that matters look dark for
the free coinage party, silver is quietly rising in
price. It is, however, highly improbable that the
metal will ever see a quotation of 4s. an ounce
again.
A pretty but very sleepy little town in
Western Victoria is mostly owned by one man

objects of interest in the vicinity. Then he takes
them up a hill, and solemnly points to three
houses in different parts of the landscape. “That
’ouse over there,” he says, “ is the ’ouse where Hi
was born. That ’ouse on the left is the ’ouse to
which we removed when Hi was a few months
hold. The ’ouse in the distance is the ’ouse where
Hi spent the greater part of my heventful life.
Them ’ouses hall belongs to me. There aint hany-
think else to see from ’ere, we better go an’ ’ave a
drink.”

The Bald-Headed Metamorphosis.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I had not seen Professor Dom for months
When I entered his Sydney laboratory the otho r
day and found him neck-deep in a series of new
experiments, the nature of which were a Chines 6
puzzle to me. But the courteous old scientist sooxx
became frankly communicative.
“ What is in this gelatine, you ask 5” said lie.
“ A new idea of my own. A new benefit to the
human race, especially in the fly season. Those
are the germ-seeds of human hair. Seeds, veri-
table seeds, already spi'outing in their habitat. It
is an old joke to say that some hair-washes would
make hair grow on a billiard-ball. But the jokes
of the scoffers of one generation become the scien-
tific realities of the next. I affirm that it is not
impossible to make an ivory billiard-ball grow a
beard, any more than it is impossible to find an
Irishman with hair on his teeth. It can be done.”
“ But what is the practical utility of your in-
vention ?”
“Why, no man and no woman need be bald.
My plan is infallible. No hair-wash, no cantha-
rides, no blistering preparation, but the actual
sowing within the scalp of the hair-seeds which
you see there. It is a tickling process, but not
painful. Not half so painful as dentistry.”
“ How did you come to think of it ? ’
“Well, skin-grafting from one person to another
has long been known to surgical science; the
transfusion of blood from a healthy and vigorous
body into a debilitated one is a determined possi-
bility ; an American surgeon has successfully
transplanted live teeth from one mouth to
another ; a rabbit’s eye has been inserted to grow
in an empty socket; and it struck me that hair
might be successfully transplanted from one scalp
to another.”
“ And those haii-secds !”
“ Are all taken from the heads of hirsute and
robust people. There is male and female hair;
hair of all shades, but carefully assorted. I can
grow a crop of any desired colour.”
“ How do you sow the seed ?”
“See this scarifier? This is run over the head
of the bald individual, and the seed is then
‘creamed’in with a chemical lather of my own.
The lather is allowed to dry in till it disappears
and the whole operation is done.”
“How long does it take hair to grow?”
“It depends on the soil. Sometimes an inch
crop is produced in 24 hours ; sometimes it takes
three days. See that bristly dog; he was hairless
two day ago.”
“ Have you ever tried it on a man ?”
“Not yet. But there is a bald-headed gentle-
man coming here this morning. In fact, he is due
now. He has agreed to let mo experiment oxx his
scalp, and he has promised to pay mo handsomely
if I am successful. As I certainly shall be. Is
that the bell ? Ah, he is here. I will descend to
the door and usher him in.”
» # •
Professor Dom left the room. What
unfortunate curiosity impelled me to inspect the
gelatines microscopically ? I was very cax-eful
with them, too, but I ought to have left things
alone.
« * *
Professor Dom re-entered with a fat»
apoplectic, bald man who perspired profusely, and
breathed like a locomotive,
“This is Mr. Lumberly, Dipso., the gentlemaxx
who has agreed to try my experiment. He desires
golden hair, and I’ve no doubt he’ll be dread-
fully giddy by the time I’ve done with him. Be
seated, Mr. Lumberly.”
The Professor went straight to work. First of
all, he washed Lumberly’s head with lukewarm
water; then passed the scarifier over the scalp,
the apoplectic old gentleman the while venting
sighs like the gasps of a blowhole; next, he
“creamed” in the seeds with a yellowish lather
of a most odious odour ; then he placed the bare-
headed old gentleman in the sun to dry. The
whole opei’ation did not take longer than a-quar-
ter of an hour.
“Now, we’re right,” said the Pi'ofessor, enthu-
siastically. “As soon as the ‘creaming ’ disap-
pears you can return home, Mr. Lumberly, and
you’ll come and see me to-morrow morning.”
« * *
I stayed with Dom that night, and we
went minutely into particulars of his many inven-
tions.
Next morning a cab drove furiously up to the
door ; there was a tremendous clatter, and an
apoplectic apparition of rage burst violently into
the laboratory, without removing his hat.
“You hoary-headed, blue-spectacled, swindling
old scoundrel,” roared Lumberly, for it was he.
“You dodgasted, infernal, devilish old beast!
You elderly, unprincipled, damnable, unmitigated
skunk ! You deceiver of bald-headed patriarchs!
But you shall pay for this dearly, if there’s any
law and justice in N.S. Wales.”
“Why, wh-what’s the matter?” gasped old
Dom.
“Matter? Villainy’s the matter! Murder’s
the matter! Guy Fawkes is the matter ! I’m
the matter, you villainous old fraud ! Vermilion’s
the matter ! A rainbow’s the matter! Look at
your dastardly handiwork and dare to splutter,
‘ what’s the matter? ”
And Lmnberly removed his hat.
I have seen a few strange sights and a few blue
devils, but never such a howling polychrome as
Lumberly’s bristles. I threw myself on to a sofa
and fairly kicked with laughter. Straight out on
the lately bald man’s head stuck up a chevaux-dc-
frise of spiny hair, designed in all the tints of the
rainbow and a few more besides ! The iridescence
was the most alarmingly comical patchwork I
ever saw. It was like a speckled hen under lime-
light ; or a brindled bulldog phosphorised in the
dark.
Golden hair, brown hair, black hair, grey hair,
carroty hair, white hair, long lady’s-hair, stiff,
beardy hair—all sorts of hair standing spikily on
guard and dazzling the vision until the eyes
detected green and blue hair amongst the rain-
bows that lifted their tips angrily outwards.
With a bellow like a wounded mastiff, Lumberly
sprang at me as I lay kicking on the sofa and
pitched me clean out on to the gravelled path in
the back garden. When I came back he was
gone, and Professor Dom had gone to sleep with
his head jammed into a wedgewood mortar, while
a number of loose detonators were keeping up a
fusillade and threatening to convert the laboratory
into a flaming fireworks-show.
The action for damages, Lumberly v. Dora will
be heard at next Law Term in Sydney. Pilcher,
Salomons, Toby Barton, and Jack Want, Q.O.’s,
have all been retained by plaintiff.
“ I can’t think how the various sorts of hair-
seeds got so mixed together,” said Professor Dom;
“ I had them all sorted separately.”
I might have enlightened him, but I didn’t.
And the microscope was as mum as I was.
“But you see, the hair-sowing invention is a
dead certainty,” added Professor Horn.
“ Undoubtedly.”
THE DIPSOMANIAC.
A Break-away.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Lannigan was smart with the whip—a cleverer
manipulator of the lash never rode behind cattle.
He could cut an ordinary bottle clean in half
from the whip’s distance, and his artistic touches
were the admiration of all who knew him, and
had seen him ornament the smooth, clean bark
of a white gum with elegant scroll-work and
original designs in filigree. He boasted that he
could pick a particular hair off a cow’s ear,
riding at half-speed, or split a mosquito
on a calf’s rump over a space of 19 feet—Lannigan
used an 18-foot lash. In undertaking this latter
feat he always stipulated for a new cracker—and a
mosquito large enough to be visible at the distance.
As an implement of trade, too, Tom got all the
business out of his whip that could be reasonably
expected from a lash in mere human hands. He
could bring tour feet of his “teaser” across the
bows of a break-away, and make the “fur” fly all
along the line, or touch him on the raw with
the knot, and sting like a bullet ; but the
trick of which he was proudest, and which proved
the most useful to him as a drovei’, was the knack
of curling the lash about the body of a “bolting”
calf, hoisting the animal, and bringing it up short,
and back to reason and the drove, without further
waste of horse:flesh, time, or profanity. Calves,
when the mischief is in them, are hard to engineer,
as any drover will tell you, and this trick of trade
was worth a heap to Lannigan.
Tom was a young man, and excepting a weak-
ness for drinks, another for the girls, and a faculty
for bad language, original and selected, he was as
good as the best. One sale day he was bringing a
mob away from the Ballarat yards. The cattle
were all fat and respectable, excepting one large,
red brute with a blazed face and a touch of the
furies. This animal had knocked himself about a
good deal in the yards, one horn was broken off
short and dangled against his jaw 7, and the thick
blood coated his head ; a dark foam hung about
his mouth, and his red eyes sparkled hatefully in
the sunlight. The big bullock refused to chum in
with the mob, and moaned ominously as he ran
ahead swinging from side to side and looking
fairly demented.
Lannigan expected trouble with this brute, and
was not kept waiting. The beast broke away pre-
sently, and made across the flat towards the
timber. Tom rode a rnare new to the business ;
she had too much “go ” as yet, and over-stepped
her game. Lannigan handled her well, how-
ever, and soon had the whip going on
the run-away, doing his best to head him.
The race was at its hottest when the
sound of a woman’s screams attracted Tom’s
attention. He looked up, and the first thing to
catch his eye was the figure of a little child directly
ahead at some distance. The youngster wore a
bright hood and toddled towards them, regardless
of the cries of a woman who, recognising the
danger, was rushing to save her child. Tom’s
eyes fell upon the red bullock again, and he
noticed the lowered head and the determined set
of the animal, and guessed its purpose. Swinging
the. whip again he worked it about the head of the
brute with all his power, bringing the mare up to
close quarters at the same time, and boring reek-
lessly. It was useless ;he recognised this in a few
seconds, and then he received an inspiration.
Driving the spurs into his nag, lie rode for the
child. There was a thunder of hoofs, a wild
whoop from Lannigan, as he rose in his stirrups,
and brought his long lash down on the youngster
with a circular movement, and in the wink of an
eye the little girl with the bright pink hood was
safe and sound in the drover’s arms; and the big
in of hie
“ f tSZ °;T ex , pert , ] f sooer ’ and

Dear Bulletin,—ln the palmy days of the
Etheridge (N.Q.), three brothers worked a claim
known as the “Better Luck.” One of them
Paddy, on one occasion was “ on a tearing spree ’’’
Father Maginnis, a muscular clergyman, hap-
pened, at the time, to be on a visit to George-
town, and persuaded Pat to take the pledge ; lest
temptation should prove too much for the novice,
whilst suffering a recovery, the reverend gentlc-
man securely strapped Patrick down on his bag-
stretcher. The good priest then retired to bis
hotel, and was engaged in prayer, as became his
vocation, when he was startled by a most infernal
clatter along the boarded verandah, and on look-
iDg for the cause discovered the decent boy from
the “ Better Luck ” trying to force his vfry into
the bar, stretcher and all.—Yours, Aramac.

The last nigger-execution in U csfc Aus-
tralia is reported as a great success. There were
three coloured gentlemen to be_ asphyxiated at
Mount Dockrell—an outlying region where there
is no gallows or other evidence of civilisation,
So a deep pit was dug, and a tip-dray drawn up
along side of it. Then the three little niggers
were seated all in a row on the edge of the dray,
with their arras tied, and their feet hanging over
the pit, and each man had a rope hitched round
his neck, the other end of the rope being secured
to a gum-tree overhead. Last of all, the hang-
man gave a great heave that sent the shafts of the
dray up in*the air, and the fated three slid off
with a howl and a screech into the excavation,
an .d two of them hung there in peace, while the
third bounced up again like an india-rubber devil
jumping out of a box, and showed a blue
countenance and a bristling shock of hair, and two
6 V es Biat stuck out like bell-toppers on a hat-rack,
f° r one instant above the edge of the pit. Then
he fell back like the,rest, and the ceremony was
over.

business. Else if he be blotchy, pimply, or disfigured, other men fight shy
of dealing with him. Let the man take Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets internally
and use Frazer’s Sulphur Soap externally,
A woman needs a good complexion else her happiness is decreased, and
her charm to the other sex much lessened. Let the woman take Frazer’s
Sulphur Tablets internally and use Frazer’s Sulphur Soap externally.

blemish, and a blood free from the taint of fever and infectious germs. Let

Soap externally.

that holds disease at bay and gives health,

fat. It is simple and truly the best of all Soaps, and contains Oil of
Eucalyptus.

Delusion.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Last night I had a happy dream:
Methought I called your name—
Beside the lonely winding stream
I called you, and you came.
For as I roamed, through mist and rain
The past my memory drew,
Till, fraught with passion and with pain,
My heart cried out to you.
I know not how you heard me call,
For we are far apart;
The lonely bush holds me in thrall,
And you the city’s heart.
But after years of silence sore,
And loneliness and pain,
You held me in your arms once more,
You kissed me once again.
We cared not for the waning light,
Nor heard the plover’s cry,
As, overhead, he wheeled his flight
Beneath the wintry sky.
For, weeping in your arms at last
I told the tale of years,
And all the sorrows of the past
Were swept away in tears.
The yellow willow-branches swayed.
There fell a golden shower;
It seemed that all my griefs were paid
In that one blissful hour !
And then you swore a mighty oath—
You held me fast and swore —
That nought but death should part us both,
Should part us evermore.
• ••••»
I woke. Myself alone I found,
And filled with strange alarms ;
The cruel darkness closed me round,
And not your brave, strong arms.
The tears were still upon my check,
But all the rest was fled—
The lonely plain, the winding creek.
The willows overhead.
I only dreamed the rain and mist,
The plover and the stream !
My love ! my love ! Say, have you kissed
Me only in a dream ?
And we arc still apart, my love !
You think me still untrue.
lam not so ! As God’s above
I never loved but you.
Alas 1 he hears not what I say !
What need for me to swear ?
The fond delusion melts away,
And we are as we were.
And thronging backwards, thick and fast,
Come all my griefs and fears.
The dream, the happiness, has passed
And only left the tears !

CLAUDIA.
Rev. Dr. Bevan, the most comfortable,
cushiony-lookin'? parson in all Australia, tells a
Melbourne audience that he rejoces over the
great depression, which was needed to check the
people’s vices—gambling and extravagance. The
round and rosy divine draws <£33 a week for in-
culcating frugality and abstemiousness in people
who consider themselves lucky when- they earn
30s. for fifty hours’ work.
Wolfe's Schnapps is the only pure and original
Schnapps. To be safe, ask for an unopened bottle.
When the pious proprietors of Melbourne
Daily Telegraph decided to stop the ruinous
publication of that respectable journal, their chief
reason, as alleged in their new mouthpiece, the
Evening ’Euald, was that the wicked composi-
tors had refused to accept a lower rate of pay
than that given by the Argus and the Age.
“ They were tired of carrying on their busi-
ness for the benefit of their workmen,” they
said. But as their losses were about £1 50
per week, it is not easy to see how a body
of forty-five compositors could have made up the
money by consenting to a reduction of a penny a
thousand. There are 30,000 pence in .£l5O, and
the compositors would have had to set 30,000,000
letters a week before they could satisfy their
employers. This would have brought the cost of
composition up to £2lOO per week, the truth
being that it was not one-tenth of that sum. The
real reason of the downfall of the journal, which
paid fairly well a dozen years ago under Sornerton
and Willoughby, was that when Balfour and
Davies and Fitchett and M‘Kinley got hold of it
those godly men gave it a fit of the snuffles from
which it never recovered.
. Fifty years ago, Thomas Cooper, the
Chartist poet, was prosecuted for sedition and
thrust into a British dungeon as a rebel. Twenty
years earlier he would have been hanged and
beheaded, like the two democrats at Stirling, but
in 1842 a term of penal servitude was considered
sufficient punishment for the miscreant who wrote
“ Slaves, toil no more ! Why delve and moil and
Pine to glut the tyrant-forgers of your chain ”
Thomas Cooper didn’t go the way of most hard
thinkers fated to be born before the world is ready
for them, and die at an early ago of sheer disgust
Hu constitution was proof against even a course
of prison treatment in the “forties.” And so it
came to pass a few weeks since that the First
Lord of the Treasury granted £230 to Thomas
Cooper, now in his eighty-eighth year, “in recog-
nition of Mr. Cooper’s literary talent and influence
an a moral teacher:'’ The old Chartist has lived to
receive a small token of respect from the same
State which formerly saw immorality, pestilence
and flat political blasphemy in his “moral
teaching.” To the dangerous socialist of 1892
The BULLETIN says : Look after your liver, avoid
draughts and take precautions against the in-
fluenza, that your days may be long in the land
where the wild “fallacies” of to-day are the
sober truths of to-morrow. Don’t get run over by
a tram, or die with all your advanced errors on
your head but hang on to existence until the main
army of plodding fools has overtaken your ideas
and passed a grant of .£2OO to keep your recog-
nised worth out of the alms-house.
Pfahlert’s Hotel, Wynyard Square, Sydney
J. Lichtscheindl, for many years proprietor of the Empire
Hotel, Wellington, N.Z., has taken over the above old
established first-class hotel. The Garden Restaurant is
now ready for the summer months.
The increase in the size of English youth
is scientifically ascribed to the abolition of phle-
botomy m the generation before last.
Wain’s Hotel, Dunedin (M.L.), has been
refused a license. Why, is a mystery up to date,
for it was one of the very best hostelries in Aus-
tralasia, and a few years ago was adorned by the
prettiest woman who ever agitated a beer-pump.
Also, there was a convenient back-door, whereby
you could get out of the hotel into one Benjamin’s
place in Manse-street, and discount a bill without
attracting attention.
i Wages are coming down fast in Melbourne.
The contractors for cleaning the city streets, who
took the job very much below the previous rate,
have knocked a big percentage off the wages of
their employes after drawing their attention to the
fact that thousands of men are walking about,
who would be glad of their jobs. This is one of
the beauties of the contract system. Governments
and corporations get their work done cheaply at
the cost of the labourer. Why not have the clerical
work dona by contract?
D Arcy Brothers, Brokers, Scott Chambers
90 i itt-street, Sydney,
Recently a Launceston (Tas.) jury struck,
after four hours on the job, and demanded lunch, as
they could get no further without something to
eat. Many a man has feed a lawyer who would
have fared much bettor could he have fed the jury.
In Pennsylvania, the Hungarians and
Croats, who build railroads and work in the
mines, have established a system of polyandry,
under which each woman has six or eight hus-
bands. And in this State there are some fifty
thousand Chinamen with not much more than
two or three thousand women among them.
It is like a voice from the grave to read
Thomas Smith Richardson’s advertisement as it
looms up to this day on the back of the Balmain
Ferry Co.’s tickets, setting forth that his dead
and execrated bank accepts deposits at the highest
rates of interest, and offers undoubted security to
the investor. And we came across another finan-
cial ghost the other day in the British Austra-
lasian, a London paper, which regularly every
week quotes the Bank of Van Diemen’s Land in
its share-list as a going concern, that pays divi-
dends, and has a big reserve-fund, and whose
shares are traded in on the Stock Exchange.

Dear Bulletin,---Re poor Barcroft Boake’s
verses “Featherstonhaugh,” printed by you h,
other day. The real name of Bluecap, the oiif
law, was Bobby Cottrell, and he was employed
a boy on Benduck station. In those days
police, when hunting bushrangers, could by ] :u !j
demand remounts from anyone possessing horses
One old sergeant in particular was very fond of
this style of thing, and very often forgot to return
the nags. One day the owner was going awav
from the station, and, knowing that the police
were likely to call in his absence, he told Bobbv
not to let them have horses if it could possibly bo
avoided. When the boss had gone Bobby planted
all the horses except one-a hopeless rogue, that
would buck its saddle off if mounted by a stranger
Presently the sergeant called and demanded
horses, so Bobby brought out the bucker, which
at once threw the officer. Nor could any others of
the police party ride him. Bobby stood bv
laughing at the troopers’ discomfiture, and, s ' o
goes the legend, the sergeant swore vengeance
and from that day forward tried all he could to
lag Robert, who in the end, under the name of
“Bluecap,” took to the bush with a mate called
“Jack the Devil.” What became of Jack, I don’t
know, but Bobby was captured and got 15 years
in Cockatoo.—The Dingo. Blackheath, ’ 12tl,
