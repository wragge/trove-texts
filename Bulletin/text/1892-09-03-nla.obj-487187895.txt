Tales of the Riverine.
“Dictionary Nod.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
BY PRIUE WARUNG.
Emerson says soiu.e where that it is an
achievement of high eloquence to confer an ex-
pressive nick-name, but no particularly fine
ouality, oratorical or other, was needed to attach
n bye-name to Ned .
Ah— now I’m stuck ! It has never dawned
upon me till this moment that in all the years
t liat I knew Ned to bo spoken of, I never heard
his surname once. Perhaps none of the men who
referred to him constantly as one of the biggest
“cures” in that region of “cures” and “queer
cards,” the Riverine district —where each square
mile has its tale of some human soul going to
wreck in its sea of grey plain—knew his surname.
Perhaps he hadn’t one to know. Most likely,
indeed, was this the case. His earliest recollection
went back to the time when he was tending
Parson Marsden’s black poleys on the venerable
Principal Chaplain’s grant at Bathurst, so, as
likely as not, Ned was one of the hundreds of
infants that were cradled in Parramatta Factory
and sent into the world worse than motherless and
with a choice among 50 fathers. At all events, I
am pretty sure none of the fellows who spoke of
y ß d to me knew his surname. Else it must
have slipped out sometimes. But it was always
‘•Dictionary Ned.”
Xow I was saying that anybody without the
faintest touch of eloquence could have given Ned
tliat name—would iiave conferred no other upon
il,im had the selection of a hundred appellations
been offered. Even a Victorian shire-councillor,
who is the least oratorical person in existence,
except when he wants a railway to his front gate,
would have called him “ Dictionary Ned.” The
cjngruity of the term was so obvious that a blind
man could have seen it.
The name had its origin in the fact that Ned
always carried a dictionary-a wonderful sort of
one. It was based “ upon the labours of Johnson,
Worcester, Webster,” and Heaven knows how
many more, “ and incorporated the latest results
uf the most modern and scientific Lexico-
graphers.” Further, it was illustrated by “ one
thousand Superb Engravings from drawings by the
Best Artists’ (I am quoting from the title page)
—and as though that was not enough to furnish
to the humble student, it supplied, at the fore-
part, an “Analytical History of the Growth
of the English Language (in two pages), and, in
appendices, a ‘Glossary’ of Scientific Terms, a
Classical Encyclopedia, and a Collection of Pro-
verbial Sayings and Phrases from all Languages.”
The whole of this overflowing repository of learn-
ing had been published at sixpence; and Ned
paid ninepence for it on his solitary trip to
Melbourne at Cole’s bookstall in Paddy's Market,
in Bourke-street, 25 years ago. Cole wasn’t a
millionaire then, and you couldn’t buy books at
English prices. You paid ninepence for a sixpenny
publication, and fifteen-pence for a shilling one,
andhalf-a-crown, and sometimes three shillings, for
a two-shilling volume. And Ned, paying nine-
pence, had therewith purchased a treasure of
wealth untellable, of joys limitless. All the
glorious orbs in the firmament of culture swam
into his ken when he pocketed the book.
Keats never extracted from Chapman’s Homer,
Landor from Shakespeare, Lindsey Gordon from
Horace, Marcus Clarke from Balzac, one thou-
sandth part of the delight Ned obtained from his
dictionary. The only volume ho ever possessed, to
him it was a library, a literature, mauy-volumed
life itself. Somehow or other, the intangible
charm that the mere study of words as words, as
the fossils of human experience and emotion, has
for so many people, had entranced this illiterate
wanderer whose home was always on the fringe
of “settled country,” who was never at ease
except he was “ inside,” who got astray in a one
street township and was utterly lost in the soli-
tudes of a great city. Amongst the thousand
and one types of humanity that wandered
over the Old Man and One Tree Plains, there was
the man who never turned in till ho had read a
chapter out of his Bible, there was the man who
carried a shilling Shakespeare, and the other who
kept his mind alive on Byron, there was the fellow
who always kept a woman’s photograph, and the
one who nourished his soul amid deadening wastes
by the crucifix dangling round his neck. The
consolation that each and all derived from his and
their several idols, Ned drank in from his pocket-
dictionary.
lie had bought it with the vain hope of
making up the deficiencies of his early educa-
tion. “Never too late to larn, boys,” he would
assure the scoffers. And though he was wise in
the wondrous lore of the plains and the rive s, “up
to any dodge ” in free-selection and station-life,
knew every trick of bush-craft and of river-craft,
had overlanded cattle in the early gold days from
Adelaide to Forest Creek, and (earlier still) sheep
from Bathurst to the valley of the Wannon in far
western “ Port Phillip,” and had held the wheel
of the Lady Augusta when she ran up to Tocum-
wal months before Cadell made his first chart of
the Murray, he esteemed his precious knowledge,
out of which so many “smarter” men had coined
small fortunes, to be worthless compared with
“book-laming.” At every interval of leisure,
and during the times of work when the duty of
the moment would not be impeded by “study,”
out would come his book. When other men
smoked or swopped yarns, or drank, Ned studied.
There was nothing complex about his methods.
1 le went straight at the business of mastering its
contents.
Somewhere about forty years of age when he
invested his ninepence, by the time he became
bargeman of the Royal Duke barge—she was built
in the epoch when ferocious “loyalty” dislocated
a man’s neck as consort of the Currency La>s
steamer, he was within a year or two of fifty. And
unremitting in his pursuit of knowledge with all
sorts of difficulties, he had mastered the dictionary
so far as “ V,” the page that begins with “ vital ”
and ends with “ votive.” Ten words a day for a
minimum, and a hundred for a maximum—when
he had a rare holiday he totted up the hundred —
he had got off by rote the words and their mean-
ings. And this was without counting the
Sundays. He had devoted those to the “ Glossary”
and the, “ Proverbial Sayings and Phrases,’ and
to the horrible combination of letters which Ih >
dictionary-compiler, on the authority of the
modern and scientific lexicographer, used to
express the pronunciation of the foreign phrases.
It was a gigantic task this last, and Ned had done
well to devote his Sabbaths to it when he had no
other occupation than to boil his white shirt for
the next Sunday. Mezzofanti himself would have
felt the task of memorising the phrases to be
herculean if lie had also found it necessary to
recjlh-et the kev to their pronunciation. .lust
think of the labour of getting off by heart not
merely the interpretation, for instance, of
L’homme propose el Dieu dispose, but the weird
and mysterious conjunction of letters which the
latest modern and scientific lexicographer
expressed the sound of the phrase: “lom-pro-a-
dyoo-dis-poz.” But all these fearful and wonder-
ful shibboleths were gradually being mastered by
Ned—to an accent, lie was a beggar to learn,
was Ned. As he himself said, “he warn’t no
slouch at stickin’ to it.”
That was the curious thing about Ned. All Ins
grinding away at vocabularies never seemed to
tinge by the faintest degree of refined colour his
vigorous colloqualism. Perhaps, in some distaiit
period, when he contemplated sitting under his
own vine and fig-tree —the most errant knight of
the Murrumbidgee plains has always a vision of
some roof-tree o’ his ain—he intended to employ
his “dictionary words,” but in the days of his
scholarship he kept to the rude, energetic speech
of his kind.
Nor was it clear why he hadn’t begun “laming”
before he reached middle-age. Once he was
interrogated upon the point, but the answer,
though apparently at the moment conclusive, does
not appear a sufficient explanation now that we
can look back.
11.
It was in the following circumstances that the
question was put to him, and the answer re-
ceived. Ned was running shares in a fencing
contract on Benduck at the ’Bidgee. Sunday
came, and Ned, having washed and ironed the
white shirt he had worn at intervals during the
week in readiness for the succeeding Sunday,
donned his other “ b’iled rag ” and the moleskins
which lie called his “ go-to-meetln’s,” though they
never went there. His toilette operations weie
observed with keen interest by one of the fellows
who had sundowned it to the men’s hut the
previous night in the expectation of the plum-duff
and lot of rum which Benduck, even more liberal
than other stations, invariably gave to the Satur-
day to Monday “whalers.” A man of middle
height and naturally sturdy frame, already, while
still young, he carried himself with the swagman’s
stoop, and his watery eyes gave the lie to the story
of natural or acquired refinement which the clear-
cut features would have otherwise told. Dirty
with the indescribable dirt of the man of position
who is debased to a congenial gutter, College Bill
revolted, as he lay on a sheepskin in the early sun-
shine, against Ned’s sacrifice at the altar of clean-
“ Who’s that toff ? ” he asked of the cook.
“bin? W’y, that’s Dic-shun-cry Ned ! Never
’erd of ’im ? ”
“ That Dictionary Ned ! My word, I didn't
know he went in for white shirts and collars ! I’ll
have some fun with him, boys—just you come and
watch ! ” .
Now, College Bill was esteemed a bit of a
humourist, or rather of a satirist. For a “Bishop
Barker” he would compose a quatrain on any
subject—a person preferred—suggested by the man
who tipped him the drink, ana for a bottle of
brandy he would write a fifty-line satire and recite
it with becoming action. It was whispered among
the bosses and “colonial-experiencers ” that he
was a University prize poem man, but that could
hardly be so, for Bill’s “Ode to Swipes,” the
shanty-keeper at One Tree, was quoted all over the
Riverine for its originality and force, and since
the first University was, there has never been a
prize-poem which contained these qualities.
Being what he was. Bill always had a claque,
and when he meandered his odorous carcase to the
tank side, where Ned was performing his toilette,
lie was followed by several others of the sundown-
ing brotherhood prepared in advance to applaud
his satirical efforts at old Dictionary’s expense.
They were already in laughter by the time they
had covered half the distance between the hut and
the tank, for Bill, as ho walked, improvised—
Devoted student! while other “ whalers” slumber
He studies hard, does Dictionary Ned !
But still he’s storing only useless lumber
In the squash pumpkin which he calls his head 1
“You’re Dictionary Ned, arn’t you?” began
Bill, as he approached. “I’m Bill College
Bill, the boys call me. Shake !”
Ned turned at the remark. Perhaps it was the
circumstance that his fingers were busy buttoning
his collar—he had only the one collar—that pre-
vented him accepting Bill’s preferred hand. Any-
how, he did not take it. He simply nodded and
said :
“Oh, yer Bill, are yer ?—College Bill? I’ve
hern o’ yer 1”
“Yes,” responded Bill, not feeling quite so easy
as he should, his reception was so chilling, “ no
doubt you have. Being brother students, y’
know ” —he paused to wink impressively at his
admirers —“ we ought to be acquainted 1”
“Ye-es —yer think so?” drawled Ned.
‘ ‘ Of course. Men of culture are not too numerous
on the river country.”
“So?”
There was a titter, not quite at Ned’s expense.
Bill was annoyed at it, and grew truculent.
“ Do you know 1 think you should drop the
‘ Ned,’ my friend.”
“Yes?”
“ You should style yourself ‘Dick.’ ‘Dictionary
Dick ’ would be not only alliterative, but would
be more euphonious !” The chorus of laughter
again went up—now on Bill’s side. Wasn’t Bill
rubbing it in ! What jaw-breakers lie could use !
Ned didn't reply, but withdrew his dictionary
from the hip-pocket where he always carried it.
“ Going to look up ‘ alliterative ’ and
‘euphonious,’ old chap?” Bill continued. “Now
don’t turn up ‘ H —you’ll find the first under ‘A,’
and ‘euphonious’ under ‘E.’” And the rouse-
abouts and swagmen grew merrier. Bill was
getting on well with his chiacking of old Ned !
Ned, however, was still silent.
“Ned,” went on Bill, “ the only two men I ever
heard of that were books in breeches were
Macaulay and yourself. Macaulay was a beggar
to talk, but you’re a beggar to keep your mouth
shut. Oh, and by-the-way, why didn’t you take
your schooling earlier ?”
“ I don’t usu’lly ring my clapper on’y when I’ve
got some toon to play,” now responded Ned.
“ That answers yer first remark. An’, as ter the
second, it’s my turn ter ask questions. Yer can
read French, Mister Bill Boozer—l beg parding—
I mean. Mister College Bill ?”
Over his drunkard’s rosiness, Bill’s face showed
a deeper red. And the audience rejoiced exceed-
ingly. “Who’d ’a thought as ol’ Dicshunery
war goin’ ter take down College Bill ?”
“Can you read French, Mister? I’ve hear say
that yer ses as yer could. An’ if yer can, jest rip
out that for th’ pres’nt comp’ny 1” He held out
in one hand the dictionary open at the “Appendix
of Foreign Phrases,” and with his other fore-
finger pointed out the phrases wdiich he wished
interpreted. Bill stared, and the carmine of his
dissoluteness and of his shame vanished together.
Grey-green, like the salt-bush scrub near by, was

mis—v a, su—hoo, jet —ze means ! Or, is’t that
he’s’shamed ter tell yer ?” He paused, and there
were muttered requests from the audience to Bill
to respond to the challenge and “take up the
parable.” But he was dumb.
“ As he can’t or won’t, coves, I’ll tell yer? ‘ Mo-
va-soo-jay,’that’s ‘ a bad subject,’the dic’shinary
ses, an’ a bad subject is a no-good-sort-o’-chap, a
rog’lar bad egg, a rotten spud, an’who’s that, I
should like ter know ? Ain’t that Bill’s picter —
ain’t that the spit o’the chap as comes down’ere
ter chiack me, the poor, ignorant roustabout as is
tryin’ter make up the loss o’what he never’ad,
an* him what chiacks me ’as’ad it all the time?
An’ what’s he done wi’ it now he’s ’ad it ? Used
it, ain’t he, ter lower hisself ter the swine as is in
the styes—don’t he act as decoy-duck ter get
shearers ter ev’ry knock-’em-down shanty in
Riv’reena? He’s used his lamin’, ain’t he, ter
prove that Gawd Almighty didn’t know His own
bizness?” He had closed his precious book as
his speech lengthened, and, with his final words,
raised his right hand as though in defiance of the
Supreme Wisdom.
“ Wot d’yer mean, Dicshinnery ?” asked one of
the group.
“What do I mean? Here Gawd gives that
boozer, that cove what’ll sell his lamin’ for a ball
—I forgot as yet fellows call it a shout now-a-days—
an’ his soul for a bottle o’ the stuff, Gawd, I say,
gives him—him, the swine—’Varsity eddication,
an’ me, an’ some o’ yer as well, who thirsts for it,
and hungers for it, why, He don’t give us our
ABC !”
Bill quailed beneath the artillery of scorn that
all eyes now levelled upon him, and walked away,
In that brief space, he had lost one nickname and
gained a choice of two others. He was no longer
Gollege Bill, but ever after, according to his com-
pany, “God Almighty’s Mistake,’ # and “ mo-ya-
soo-jay.” More French was spoken in Riverina
in consequence of this episode than was taught
in its schools. And the teacher was simple
“ Dictionary Ned ” and the manual, his ninepenny
compilation of the lexicographers’ labours.
HI-
A man’s hobbv is oftentimes his death, as well
as his delight. This was Ned’s case.
The great spurt of pastoral enterprise in
Southern Riverina, which occurred in the late
Sixties, operated advantageously upon Ned, as
it did on everybody else except the shepherds who
found themselves being gradually displaced by
“Hylands’’and “ Whitecross,” and the old-style
squatter who wouldn’t move with the times, and
who consequently got “shifted”into back country
and Queer-street in one and the same impulse,
Ned, when the spurt set in, gave up rouseabout
and odd job work, and took finally to the rivers,
One short season as deckhand proved his trust-
worthiness, and the next season he was promoted
to bargeman. Ten pound three and fourpence per
month, live like a fighting-cock—there never was
a boat on the rivers which kept its hands on
skimpv allowance, save one—and the 1 est chance,
if he wished it, to ullage the cargo; this was his
billet. Too honest, however, to ullage, accustomed
to live too sparely to revel in luxury, Ned seem-
ingly put his increased screw to no better purpose
than the rebinding of his dictionary.
The cUth cover of tin treasured volume had
become d'lapidated, an 1 one day when the
Currency Lass was mooie.l at Echuca wharf, ho
took advantage of a “smoke-oh ! ” spell to run up
to the Riverine Herald office, then managed by
Johnny D for Angus Mackay, of Bendigo,
“ Yer can get this re-bound for n.e, Johnny—fine
now, an’gilt edges.” “ I’ll send it to Melbourne,”
said Johnny, gingerly turning over the greasy,
thumb-marked pages, “to Detmold.” “Butdon’t
you think, Ned, it’s time you had a new copy ?’
‘ A new copy !” echoed Ned. “ It’s easy ter see
as yer not a leadin’ man, Mr. D , for all yer
run a noospaper. If yer were, ye’d know as a
book a lone man ’as used for a matter of ten years
is mother, an’ missus, an’ kids, an’drink, an’ all
ter him ! A new copy ! Blazes !” And so the
old book round which the tendrils of Ned’s heart
had grown, went down to Detmold, the famed
Melbourne binder, to be dressed in delioately-per-
fumed leather, with flexible sides, and riehly-
tooled bands, and gloriously-gilt edges, and all the
rest of the finery so delightful to the book-lover’s
mind and so ruinous to his purse,
During the month following Ned felt all the
distraction and all the sorrows that spring from a
gap made in one’s life when his hobby-horse is
stolen from him. No man gets half the pleasure
out of his business that he does out of his hobby,
and he bears, therefore, the loss of his business
better than he does that of the avocation of his
leisure. And Ned was disconsolate, and would
not be comforted—“moped,” as his mate said,
“like a native companion, and sorrowed as Jim
Dickson, of the Cumberooraa, didn’t when he
became a widder-man.” It was a standing joke
on the rivers how Dickson had sorrowed when the
news of his wife’s death reached him from Sydney,
He was at Hay, and he hired the galvanised-iron
Temperance-hall for a dance that same night.
“ I’ve got to dissipate my grief, ladies and gents!”
he said to his guests. And if the depth of his
sadness is to be gauged by the extent of his dissi-
pation, he was pre-eminent in grief amongst men.
Ned, however, didn't drown his sorrow in Lind-
say’s beer. He simply moped,
But as the time drew near when he might expect
the book, he brightened up. The Currency Lass,
with her somewhat disreputable consort, the Royal
Duke, was coming down stream from Burrabogie
station to top up at Hay with back-block clip,
when, just in the narrow bend opposite the town
cemetery, the crafts met the Resolution and
barge laboriously steaming with timber and wire
for the up-river runs. The warning-signals were
exchanged and the steamers were slowed down.
It was an awkward place to meet in. It takes
careful steering enough to allow for the tangental
force of the current in a sharp bend m carrying a
steamer round the curves ; it is trebly difficult
when it is a question of getting a barge round as
well; but the task became formidable when the
surge and sweep of the current is complicated with
the rule of the road and two not-too-smartly-
handled boats going in the opposite direction.
Still, all would have gone well if it had not been
for the Dictionary.
Linton, skipper of the Resolution, was at her
wheel. On recognising the Currency Lass ahead
he had sent down to his cabin for a parcel which
had been entrusted to his care, and when he saw
Ned, as he expected, at the wheel of the Lass’
barge, ho hailed him, and brought the Resolution’s
stern a point nearer the slowly-moving Royal
Duke. •
“Ned, there! Diction-ary Ned !”
“Aye, aye, Mr. Linton !’’
“ ’Speoting anything, Ned ?”
AH Ned’s desolation and expectation went out
in his eager tones.
“Yes, skipper! My book—’ave yer got it?”
In his excitement he had forgotten his usual
cautious devotion to the work in hand. Instead
of keeping his barge’s head inshore he steadied it
mechanically.
“ Yes !” shouted Linton, in reply. “Johnny
D said you’d growl like h if it was
knocked about in the mail, and as I was first boat
he asked me to bring it. Here you are!”
Holding his wheel with his left hand, he drew
with his right the carefully-wrapped package from
the seat of the pilot-house, and swung his arm so
as to gain impetus for the throw.
“Ready, Ned,” he called ; “Lookout!” He
did not notice that in the movement he had
shifted the Resolution’s course dangerously near
the Royal Duke. Nor did Ned, fearful the book
might fall in mid-stream, perceive his duty. He
shouted to Linton, “Hold hard, skipper!” and
ran along the wheel-platform so that the toss
would be an easy one.
On river barges the wheel-stand is shifted with
the disposition of the cargo-now for’ard, now
aft; now raised, now lowered. On long trips it is
geared ; on short ones, held in position simply by
its own weight and the rudder-chains. Now,
from Burrabogie to Hay was but a few hours’
trip, and as the top-bales would have to here-
stowed at the township wharf, the platform of
the Duke was not stayed. Running to its flat
end to get his precious book, Ned forgot this.
When he remembered it, he was between the
sheathing of the Duke and the steamer—jammed !
A crunch, and a shriek, and a horrid splash !
In their beginnings all catastrophes are so
simple—are so easily preventive if the initial
blunder in the man or the weakness in the thing
could be only understood to be the beginning of
disaster! The gearing of that wheel-platform
to the vessel’s sides—and it would not have
slipped under Ned’s rush to port? A turn of her
wheel, and the Resolution would have stood up-
stream ten feet away from the barge. But the
platform of bolted planks was not stayed down,
Linton’s hand failed to send the gaily-painted
spokes revolving, and the result was that poor old
Dictionary was done for. It was not a very
heroic way of dying, perhaps—and for the sake
of a ninepenny book, too ! But, then, the book
was Ned’s hobby, and men go to the death, do they
not, all the world over for their hobbies. A king
is but a hobby, a woman another ; and Ned’s hobby
had never deceived him—had never smitten him
with the despair of broken faith! And of what
king or woman can that be said?
IY.
He lingered for a few days, sometimes partly
conscious, sometimes delirious —oftener still,
pathetically dead to sound, almost to sight. But
about ten hours before his death—he “went
inside ” at sun-down on Sunday—he revived to a
calm clearness of brain. Among the watchers—
there were as many as the hospital surgeon would
permit—was one whom Ned was vainly trying to
recognise. And the man saw the glance and
understood.
“ Don’t you know me, ‘Dictionary?’ I’m Bill
—College Bill! The fellow you gave it to so hotly
on Ben duck three or four years ago—don’t you
remember ? ”
A flicker of a surprised smile shone on Ned’s
face, whose tan was changing to pallor.
“ Yer—Bill ’ ” bo whNnered “ Ynr’vp-a-
11 Ul ’ 1 \v nisperea. ya\o a
col-lar . _
A change, indeed, had come over Bills appear-
ance. He wore not a collar alone, but a “ b’iled
shirt,” and—heresy !—studs, and his suit of cast-
’em-aways was replaced by Geelomr tweed slops.
“Vpc T’m Ttlllt T milled nn Nprl snnn -.ftpr
Yes, i m Bui . I 1 ullec! up, A eel, soon alter
you let me have it. 1 went on one big spree, and
then gave the drink best. I tried my best to get
out of the styes, Ned. And you helped me.”
“ Ye-es ? W’ere are yer—now ? ”
“At Pimpampa, teaching the super.’s b; ( i ,
I’m putting my education to some purpose \ r ,V
at last ! ” ’
There was a silence, broken by Ned.
“Now, Bill —Mister Bill-on yer oath ter
dyin’ man ! D’yer mean ter keep straight ? ” a
“ Before God, I do, Ned ! ”
“ Where’s my die shun-ery ? ”
This was the first time he had asked for it. r pi
surgeon gave it to him, in its luxurious ga r t,
Russian leather, with graceful scrolls of gilt' lj n °,
relieving the dark brown. He took it, but
slipped through his nerveless fingers to the coun
terpane. He gazed on it curiously.
“Ter think as I can’t hold th’ ol’ book ! ” ]
whispered. “ Bill, page 1-4-7, please ! ” ’ 10
Bill turned up the page. Against one word w™
pencilled a cross.
“ See that? ” He pointed to the cross.
Bill nodded.
“Read it—slow! ”
“ In-cin-er-ate—to burn to ashes.’’
‘‘l’ve a few hund’erd—ev’rybody listen, plen Sfi
—in Boyd’s Bank.f They’re yours, Bill ” .
“No, no !” exclaimed Bill.
“ Wait! What folks do with their corpsuses-
when they don’t want ter —be buried ? ” Strange
how strong his voice grew !
“Order their bodies to be given to the hospi-
tals,” said the surgeon, with an eye to business.
“ Cremate them ? ” suggested Bill, thinking of
“ incinerate.”
“That's the word ! Lor’, what a thing 'tis ter
have lamin’, Bill! But the word ain’t in any
dio’shunery, an’ that chap there ” —pointing to the
marked word—“ was nearest I could find ! ”
“You wish to be cremated?” questioned the
surgeon, still professionally alert.
“Yes—ere, ere—oh, dash it, I don't see what
they want ter use words not in the dic'shuner-
for ! In-ci-ner-ate—that’s my ticket.”
“ And the expenses will be defrayed by the
money in the Bank ! Hadn’t you better sign a
will?” Again, the surgeon.
“ Hang a will! Bill’s ter have all the spons -
yer all witness —after he’s burntme. Boyd’llfix it; ’
And he mumbled on and on, into slumber— and
at sundown he went “ beyond the boundary ”
* # *
Boyd did fix it—very irregularly, and to
the detriment of the Curator of Intestate Estates’
Commission —as soon as he was satisfied that Bill’s
claim was bond-Jidc. And it is gratifying to know
that Ned’s few hundreds planted his legatee’s feet
firmly on the upward path. Bill has suffered in
all these years only one relapse from decent
behaviour. That was when, in 77, he stood for
Parliament. But, by that time, be had won
popular respect, and people thought too much of
him to give him ids way. They rejected him, and
he is still, therefore, an honoured member of the
community, and unqualified for gaol.
And as v to the manner of the incineration of
Bargeman Ned and his dictionary—why, that is a
tale for another time.

The Queensland Exodus.
The grotesque scheme of wholesale emigra-
tion to the Argentine States, lately formu-
lated by some feather-brained leaders of the
Queensland unions, is gradually assuming a
concrete form. When this amazing project
was first advanced The Bulletin regarded
it as so utterly foolish and impracticable, so
hopeless, and so glaringly ridiculous as to be
hardly worth serious comment. It was
difficult to believe that any sane body of
men could actually entertain such an idea ; it
seemed an amusing chimera, and nothing
more. But according to recent advices it
would appear that the exodus is actually to
be attempted. Sundry delegates were
despatched to the Argentine States, and
their mission appears to have met with some
measure of success. An immense grant of
land is said to have been secured ; and unless
something of an unexpected nature should
intervene the very best and most enterprising
members of the Queensland democracy will
shortly undertake the hopeless task of con-
structing an ideal commonwealth on the
dreary plains of La Plata. It is almost in-
variably the bone and muscle of the nation
which goes forth on such expeditions—in
other words, it is the strongest section of the
community—the section which should have
led the way in restoring freedom to Queens-
land which proposes to be the first to give
up the contest and retreat ignominiously,
leaving the Kanaka Cabinet masters of the
situation.
• * *
The one aspect of the case which cannot bo
disguised is that the proposed exodus to the
Argentine is a confession of defeat. For about
three years the Queensland labour-unions
have carried on a desultory warfare with the
Griffith Government, and now they are
apparently weary of the contest, and those
who can escape are anxious to retire from
the battlefield. Most of the leaders are
going, and the followers who cannot go are
to be left in the lurch. Three years—for it
is only during that period that the struggle
with a retrogressive Government has assumed
an acute form—is not so very long ; many
races which the Australian regards with pro-
found contempt have maintained a far harder
jontlict for three centuries, and though their
enfranchisement is to-day almost as remote
as over, they show no signs of giving up the
struggle. There has been no effort to upset
the incubus of the Coalition, either by con-
stitutional means or by force and bloodshed,
and the unionist leaders have not the excuse
that they have staked their all in the cause
of Liberty and lost. They have staked nothing
as yet, and lost nothing ; in fact, they pro-
pose to fly before the battle has seriously
commenced. There has been no general
election in Queensland since Griffith’s in-
sanity came upon him, and he set up in
business as a new description of absolute
monarch ; and, therefore, the democracy
has not even definitely joined issue with
its enemies. Its strength is an unknown
quantity ; even if it makes its best
effort at the polls it may be defeated, in
which case the Kanaka party has a fresh
lease of existence for another three years,
and there is no immediate hope of improve-
ment ; on the other hand, it may achieve
such a triumph that—provided it makes good
use of its victory—Queensland will belong to
it for ever afterwards. But until the effort
is made, any attempt at wholesale emigration
is treason to, and base desertion of, the cause
of Liberty. The prominent unionists who
are leading the movement were appointed to
the office they hold in order that they might
do their best to save Australia from the curse
of capitalism—not that they might bolt igno-
miniously with a few of their followers, and
found a Gtopia in Argentina. Their exodus
will appreciably weaken the democratic vote;
it will dishearten the democracy by proving
conclusively that its chiefs have no faith in
themselves or in their own cause ; and it will
play the game of the Gkiffilwraith Coalition
as effectually as even the Coalition’s paid
hirelings could have done.
« # #
Moreover, even assuming that the Queens-
land argonauts owe no duty whatever to their
country and their cause —that there is no
ignominy in their hurried flight to escape
from one fat capitalist and one lean one—
that the leaders were appointed for the ex-
press purpose that they might desert the
bulk of their followers at the earliest oppor-
tunity and provide for themselves in the
green (because distant) pastures of Argentina
—there are other aspects of the case. The
movement is only another instance of that
eternal craving to move on which is the
Anglo-Saxon’s panacea for every ill. He is
haunted by a conviction that somewhere on
this round earth there is a terrestrial Paradise
and if he only keeps moving long enough he
will find it ; and the one lesson which he will
not learn is that there is no such Paradise to
be found even if he moves from the rising to
the setting of the sun, and from the wastes
beneath the Pole star to the Antarctic zone.
The writer of this has travelled in many
lands, and Australia—bad as it may be—is
the best of them all. Which does not say
much for this continent, but it says still less
for the rest of the globe. There is no single
advantage to be found in La Plata which
could not be found equally well in West
Australia, in Tasmania, in Maoriland, or
anywhere in the vicinity of Rockhampton, or
of Gosford in New South Wales, or in a
thousand other localities equally familiar.
Its one recommendation is its remoteness ;
it is so remote that very few of the deluded
emigrants will ever get back.
« * *
The leading attraction of the promised
land that lies beside the Rio de la Plata is
the concession which, wo are told, has been
made on so lavish a scale by the Argentine
Government. But, even assuming that this
grant is absolutely reliable—which is doubt-
ful —that it is not liable to be revoked by any
future Government, or abolished in some
future revolution, the cost of reaching the
new labour commonwealth is so heavy that
the result will bo much the same as if the
emigrants bought the site of their great
experiment from the Queensland Lands
Office, and remained at home to over-
turn the Coalition at next general election.
The land, at the best, is probably some
drought-cursed tract on the remote pampas
where all the worst features ot Queensland
scenery are reproduced with rare fidelity. It
is difficult to imagine that the Argentine
Government, any more than that of Queens-
land, would give away a whole province of
good agricultural or pastoral territory gratis
to any casual strangers who asked for it-
especially as the Treasury at Buenos Ayres
is at the present moment ten times more in-
solvent than even that at Brisbane. There-
fore the probabilities are either that the
alleged grant is situated in some utterly
unsaleable desert, or that it lies in some
border region where the Australian colonists
will come in handy as a buffer in case of in-
vasion, or that the State intends to get the
value of its concession in some way out of
the colonists at some future date, or else that
there is no grant at all. And evtn if all
these doubts are satisfactorily settled the
Argentine presents few attractions. The
Queensland emigrants want to getaway from
a country which is ruined by misgovernment
and a great commercial crisis, and they pro-
pose to go to a land that is still more
ruinously misgoverned, and where the com-
mercial crisis is far more severe. Also, they
want to escape from cheap Kanaka, Chinese,
Italian, and other pauper labour, and
to do so they contemplate going where
pauper labour is seen almost at its worst.
There are over 1| million Italians in Argen-
tina and much other assorted cheap labour
of almost all the nationalities on earth, com-
pand to which the Kanaka and the other
low-priced intruders of Queensland are too
few to be worth counting. The wealth of
the country, per head of population, is less
than one-third that of Australia. Ihe
Government lias all the evil charac-
teristics of Griliilwraithism with many
others peculiarly its own. It is reck-
less, utterly corrupt, and aggravated by
occasional dictatorships and revolutions, and
the nation is loaded down with useless mili-
tary burdens, and subject to intervals of
martial law and administration at the cannon’s
mouth. It is a land, in short, where the
strong military adventurer comes uppermost
—a troubled land, full of broken banks and
depreciated paper-money and starving “un-
employed,” and all manner of disasters.
• # »
Last of all, the moral aspect of the case is
worthy of consideration. The Queensland
refugees propose to abandon Australia be-
cause it is ruined by land-grabbing and
capitalism, which are contrary to all demo-
cratic principles, and, therefore, it is un-
seemly that these same refugees should
straightway go land - grabbing in South
America on their own account. For the
men who object to the Chinaman, or the
-British capitalist, or Thomas MTlwraith’s
foreign syndicates invading their own country
and seizing on its fertile acres, to go on an
exactly similar errand to a foreign land, is
base hypocrisy. The patriots who raise the
cry, “Australia for the Australians !” should
recognise that Argentina should also be for
the Argentines. The race whose hope is in
the future independence of our rich and
wide-spreading land, should stay to win that
independence for itself. The people of La
Plata gained their freedom many years
ago by a desperate struggle against
heavy odds, and if the Australian has
not the patience and the energy to
carve out his own destiny in like manner
at least he should not endeavour to reap
what others have sown. The people of this
continent rose up in a memorable outburst
of wrath when William Booth proposed to
plant a semi-socialistic colony of British
paupers in Australia, and begged in the
name of charity for a tract of land on which
to conduct his experiment, and it is a strange
appendix to that episode that almost at the
same moment a colony of Australians should
begin semi-pauper fashion for-a similar con-
cession from a Spanish-American State. It
would be interesting to know if the parallel
is likely to go any further. If Booth had
obtained his grant the title-deeds would
have been made out in his own name, and
he could thereupon have abandoned the
cause of charity and set up in business as a
rack-renting landlord, had he been so
inclined. In whose name will the Argentine
grant be made out, and what security will
the colonists have that their trustee will
keep faith with them ? Also, is there any
visible reason to believe that the Argentine
Government will keep better faith with the
Queensland emigrants than the Queensland
Government has done with the Italians,
Kanakas, and others whom it lured under
various pretences to the shores of Northern
Australia ? And if the whole Argentine
scheme proves the bubble which it appears
to be, will the cheap Australian stranded in
La Plata be entitled to any more sympathy
than the cheap Chinaman or Italian stranded
in Australia '( These are questions which
urgently want answering, and the answers
are dilhcult to find.
Labouchere and Queen Victoria.
This exclusion of Hunky Labouciiere from
(Gladstone’s Cabinet is the only really signi-
ficant feature connected with the composi-
tion of that spurious “Liberal” body. How
significant the incident is, may be understood
by the commotion which it has occasioned. The
Tory newspapers are everywhere commenting
with undisguised delight on the matter, and
affect to sneer at Labouchere’s pretensions.
These sneers are absurdly forced. It has not
been pretended that it would have been ridicu-
lous for any single one of the persons whom
Gladstone hats included in his Administration
to have expected such selection. Yet, intellec-
tually and politically, the personality of
Labouciiere towers above that of every mem-
ber of the Cabinet, with the doubtful excep-
tions of John Morley, Sir William Harcourt
and Lord Rosebery. No candid man can really
conceal from himself that the reason for
Labouchere’s exclusion has not been that he
is too insignificant, but that he is too signifi-
cant ; not that lie is too small, but that lie is
too big. Further, for years past, Labouciiere
has been indicated as a certain Minister of
State should a Liberal Cabinet assume office,
and during all that time there have been no
sneers at the idea, although there have been
many cries of repugnance and of fear from
Tory quarters. That his qualifications for office
were recognised, has been amply demonstrated
by the fact, stated by himself and still un-
challenged, that he had been invited to write
declining inclusion in the Administration. This
proceeding furnished clear evidence that Mr.
Gladstone perceived that he would be com-
promised alike by appointing Mr. Labouciiere
to a portfolio and by omitting to offer him one,
and wanted him to help him out of the dilemma
by an act of self-immolation, which there was
no justification for demanding of him.
# # #
The awkwardness of the situation tints
created is only equalled by the stupidity w hich
rendered it necessary. This stupidity, more-
over, is not chargeable on Gladstone. No one
in England or elsewhere will dream of ascribing
so obvious a blunder to that exceedingly astute
politician. And, moreover, the grave and
abiding consequences which have become inevit-
able, are not so inconvenient to Gladstone as
to the Throne. The stupidity proceeds from the
same quarter as the influence which was instru
mental in having Labouchere kept out of th'
Cabinet. The actual result has been to exhib t
the Sovereign in the character of an individual
giving effect to a personal animosity and spirit
of revenge. The efforts which have been made
to obscure the fact that the reason for Labor
ciiere’s exclusion is his personal antagonism to
the continual demands of the Crown for grants
to members of the Queen’s family, have been
faint and ineffectual. The truth glares out
with dazzling radiance, and penetrates the
paltry veils and curtains of shuffling evasion
and prevarication with which it has been
attempted to extinguish its illumination, ft
has been in vain that Gladstone has, tardily
been prompted to divert attention from the
essential circumstances. Gladstone has not
even ventured to deny that it was in deference
to the ascertained will of the Sovereign that he
passed over Labouchere. All that he ventures
to advance is that he assumes the responsibility
for the fact that Labouchere was not invited
to become a member of the Ministry, and
that Labouchere’s name was not submitted to
Queen Victoria. The first admission admits
nothing. Gladstone’s responsibility existed
whether his act was spontaneous or vicarious
As for the latter statement, it is ridiculous and
alters the facts not one tittle. The question
in the public mind—or rather the impression to
be removed, for there is no doubt in the public
mind—is that the Queen had caused Gladstone
to be made aware that she wished that Mr.
Labouchere’s name should not be submitted to
her.
* * *
The immediate outcome of this is precisely
the contrary to what plainly was intended.
The design was, obviously, to diminish Labou-
chere’s importance as a public man and a
politician. The thing achieved has been to
even magnify his influence. Included in the
Cabinet and surrounded by the heavy Whigs
who constitute it, Labouchere must have been
almost effaced. He would have found himself
controlled by his colleagues. His vivid per-
sonality would have been repressed by the mere
weight of the heavy - witted mediocrities
associated with him. Even his pen, from whose
point electric sparkles of penetrating satire
have so regularly burnt holes in the privileges
of “ the classes,” would have been deprived of
some of its destructive brilliance. The Right
Hon. Henry Labouchere would have been a
gigantic shadow compared with the compact
efficient substance of Henry Labouchere, 1 the
Radical freelance. To lose such an opportunity
of smothering a character so formidable would,
by itself, have been a blunder indicative of the
most abject stupidity. But when the commis-
sion of that display of folly involved the
augmentation equally of Labouchere’s inclina-
tion towards destructive criticism and of the
potency of his exertions, it required an inspira-
tion of really fatuous imbecility to enter upon
a course so suicidal. The condensed purport of
the Royal interference in the composition of
the Cabinet is, whether intentionally or not,
made too pointedly plain for any rational being
to misapprehend it. The public man who in
the exercise of his functions as a representative
of the Commons of Britain resists the deter-
mination of the Sovereign to exploit the
Treasury for the enrichment—at the expense of
the taxpayer—of the Royal brood and such
princes and princelets, wealthy or pauper, as
wed among them, is officially warned by this
incident that he will incur the personal
animosity of the occupant of the Throne, that
such animosity will find vent in vindictiveness,
and, what is more important, that the Sovereign
will refuse to accept as an Executive Minister
persons who dare to commit themselves to such
resistance to the Royal will and the Royal '
greed.
* * *
There has been no such situation in England
since the reign of James 11. That is to say,
not that James sought to provide for his
children, but that he personally resented oppo-
sition to his will. The cases of Fox and of
Canning are scarcely parallel. Neither of these
statesmen represented a growing political
theory. And, above all, neither of them, not-
withstanding Canning’s literary brilliancy, lived
in the days of widely-circulated periodicals.
Labouchere (a man, by the way, of aristocratic
birth) is a far more formidable personage than
either of these. He has wealth sufficient to make
the emolument of office a matter of indifference
to him, and he controls an organ which has had
more influence in moulding public opinion than
the Times and all the other so-called great
dailies combined. This influence is not due to
any supremacy of Labouchere’s journalistic
talent over the combined accomplishments ol
the galaxy of able writers who provide the
articles which are published in the daily press.
It may be attributed to the circumstance that
whereas, depressed by the influence of bour-
geois proprietors, the writers on the daily
papers have to be content with skimming the
surface of things, and dealing with every matter
in that spiritof conventionality which reduces the
most brilliant to dullness, Labouchere’s paper
treats, without hesitation, of the thoughts and
tendencies which are as yet but embryotic in
the public mind, and which have not yet
received the sanctification of universal accept-
ance. Thus, while the daily journals and
others which follow their example continually
utter homilies upon old and threadbare fabrics
of thought, and are consequently supremely
uninteresting, Labouchere’s Truth persists
in exploring new regions and generally m
a fresh and dashing style, and is, therefore,
read with avidity. "No one observes with more
than languid interest the tillage of an oft-culti-
vated field. But the exploration of new regions,
or the development of original inventions,
irresistibly attracts eager and curious attention.

Labouchere has been subjected to affront are
naturally enough shared by millions of Britons.
That the Sovereign should be liberally 7
is generally assented to ; but that the taxpayer
should be levied upon to maintain in affluence
everyone of her immediate descendants is wide y
resented. Moreover, the related ideas wluc
prevail in the minds of people who think thus,
and of which Labouchere has been
guished expounder, are also widely dittusec r


I t ]ji a wa y that gentleman is the representative
of a powerful and rapidly increasing political
rty. Hence, in declaring war against Labou-
ciiehe the Sovereign has, in effect, set herself in
direct personal antagonism to a numerous sec-
tion of her subjects—a section, moreover, which
must according to all human probabilities and
to the precedents taught by history, before long
assume a distinct and predominant place in the
Commons. Nothing can be more apparent
than the tendency of"the venerable distinctions
of Whig and Tory, Conservative and Liberal, to
crumble. These have no real basis left in them.
The political interests which they respectively
pretend to represent have become obliterated.
The real hue of antagonisms has shifted, and it
seems inevitable that before many years shall
Pave elapsed the absence of genuine differences
between a Conservative earl and a Liberal duke
will have made itself telt, while the real and
intense incompatibility of the aims of the
“masses” and the “classes” will compel a
corresponding re-constrnction of parties in the
Parliament of the country. In that event it
will be the Labouchere stamp of men who will
be leaders of the popular cause, and the episode
under notice has made the Sovereign the leader
on the other side. In such case, a Parliamen-
tary victory would become equivalent to a
defeat for the monarch, and the inevitable cry
of vee victis ! will be fraught with a signifi-
cance menacing to the very institution of
Royalty. A more egregious blunder than
has just been committed has seldom been
recorded in the history of England, and never
without being followed by momentous conse-
quences. It is perhaps natural that a Queen
should, owing to the atmosphere of adulation
and trumpery precedence in which she lives,
miscalculate altogether the potency of an ex-
clusion from the great offices of State. It is
conceivable that it might appear to her that
her frown can blast and degrade. But the day
when such blighting results were accomplish-
able by royal displeasure have gone by. Labou-
chere, the Radical of “noble” birth, might
have been nearly annihilated by conferring office
on him. By refusing it to him on the ground
that he is a Radical, he has been rendered
terrible. He has been aggrandized to the point
of disputing with the Sovereign the affection
and confidence of the people of England. It is
cabled that at Northampton a meeting ended in
a general melee, cheers being given for the
Queen and countercheers for Labouchere —her
political rival.
The Keely Humbug.
A VOLUME dealing with the alleged bichloride of
gold cure of dipsomania, and entitled, “ Is it a
xModern Miracle ? ” lias been sent to us for
review. It is undoubtedly a modern miracle
that although Maudsley has lived and written,
that although every scientist of note who has
devoted any attention to the subject has re-
garded dipsomania as the result of an organic
lesion, there are still people in the world pre-
pared to believe in the Keely remedy. He
who pines for either alcohol or opium is yearn-
ing for the balance of the wholesome constitu-
tion which Nature has denied him * his thirst is
a protest only against mal formation. Some-
where at the back of the old truism that “a
man cannot be too careful in the selection of
his ancestors ” lies the secret of all inebriety ;
and we who have grasped this fact can have but
little faith in the efficacy of bichloride of gold,
or any other nostrum.
* 9 #
The question of the drunkard’s cure is not one
of reformation but of re-formation ; and to dig
about and manure a weeping willow in the hope
of converting it into an oak-tree would be no
more absurd than the injection of an inert salt
of gold with the hope of changing organic
tendencies. We have dived into Mr. Calhoun’s
voluminous record of candid personalities,
pseudo-scientific theories, and doubtful testi-
monials, and have emerged from it with the
firm conviction that, as a modern miracle,
the actual giving of gold cannot compare
in its results with those of an allied treat-
ment now adopted by a leading physician of
our acquaintance, who first catches his dipso-
maniac, and having filled his hypodermic
syringe with pure distilled water, draws parti-
cular attention to the golden needle. Then
he solemnly makes the injection, assuring the
patient, at the same time, that no craving can
possibly return for ten hours. Exactly at the
end of the period named, the thirst becomes
intolerable, and the victim comes back for a repe-
tition of his specific—the intervals lengthening,
until one dose a week is found to be sufficient,
and the patient goes away with the bright,
thankful face of a poisoned man who has found
his antidote, one in whom persuasion and
belief had ripened into faith, and faith become
a passionate intuition.
# # «
The whole of the world’s drinkers belong to
the comprehensive natural order known among
scientists as epileptics, an order characterised
by an incontinence of nerve - element that,
lengthened out, spells “ tragedy,” and extend-
ing from Swedenborg who made a religion to
Mary Jones, who last night made a beast of
herself. It requires but little insight to under-
stand the slight basis upon which the cures
recorded by Mr. Calhoun in his volume are
founded. A pathetic desire to be cured and a
tendency to believe in quackery are permanent
characteristics of all drunkards, and the patent-
medicine-taker himself supplies the active
principle in the faith and hope engendered
• # #
Extensive research into the physiological
action of gold has shown that it does not belong
to that division of metals known and valued
as nerve-stimulants, and it is difficult to under-
stand why either zinc or arsenic, with their
established and well-founded reputations, was
not chosen as the basis of this physic. It may
be that the glamour which hangs about the
name of Gold—and this nowhere more than in
ankeeland—has been of commercial value to
ie cute promoters, and we are the more in-
towards this belief by seeing that a
elbourne firm has gone “one better” and
ciscovored a “ diamond remedy” for inebriety,
only remains now for some enterprising Aus-
tralian to dissolve pearls, or make a syrup of
sapphires.

And just as we have done writing, an extract
from London Referee is handed us :
Like the Medical Society of London, I have not much
faith in the so-called Gold Cure for drunkenness, which
has been brought over here by its American inventor.
The objection of the Medical Society to Mr. Keely’s nos-
trum is that its composition is not disclosed, and that it
is being run, consequently, on the lines of the ordinary
quack remedy. If the beneficial results of the “cure”
were undeniable, that objection would have little weight
with me. I should accept it on its merits, and willingly
allow its shrewd Yankee patentee a pecuniary reward for
his cleverness. But I am not at all convinced that
inveterate drunkenness can. be cured, or that it is even
worth curing.- Lately I have happened to be able to
devote a good deal of attention to this sinister subject,
and the results are curious, not to say unexpected. The
medical books will tell you that about halt the number
of habitual drunkards suffer from the hereditary
taint. This, I am convinced, is not an accurate
statement of the facts. The percentage is much higher,
so much so that I am in some doubt as to whether
habitual drunkenness can exist at all without hereditary
predisposition. In two of the worst examples that I have
been examining there is no hereditary taint apparent to
the uneducated eye, neither the parents nor the grand-
parents, nor any of the near collaterals of the victims,
having been addicted to the vice. And yet nerves are at
the bottom of the business.
*99
“ Nerves” conduce to drunkenness in two ways. The
well-known “ sinking ” feeling, which many women allege
as their reason for taking a drop of something, is supposed
to be an “effect” of drinking. My own observation
leads me to regard it often as a genuine “ cause,” having
its origin in a congenital weakness of the nervous system.
Another class of habitual drunkards require “ soothing”
rather than stimulating, and it will be lound in these
cases that the victims, especially women, before taking
to the brandy-bottle, have had recourse to opiates
of various kinds. Doubtless indulgence in drink aggra-
vates whatever mischief may already exist, but the
nervous predisposition may be such as to render life
a burden without it and to unfit its victims for the
ordinary responsibilities of citizenship. By keeping these
wretched people from stimulants you do not cure them,
you merely drive the evil into other channels, one of
which may be insanity if the excitability of the victim is
very marked. Now, these various nervous conditions are
as much hereditary' as any specific complaint could be.
It is a mistake to suppose that predisposition does not
exist because the father or mother of a drunkard has not
been addicted to drunkenness. What is inherited is not
a taste for drink, as many worthy people suppose, but a
nervous instability, which drinking relieves, for the time
being, at least.
9 9 9
In order to cope with such physical predisposition as I
have described, the gold cure, or any other cure, would
have to effect a radical change in the nervous sys-
tem, and, if this could be done, we might hope to
eradicate not merely drunkenness, but a score of
other ailments equally fatal to their victims. Malfor-
mations, for example, are due to some defect in the
nutritive processes, which have their seat in the nervous
system. Will any American professor have the hardi-
hood to come forward and undertake to cure the halt
and the hump-backed? I opine not, because there the
uselessness of his nostrum would be too apparent. All
these mysteries of growth and predisposition are really
too deep-seated for our poor human science to compass.
We can only verify the facts and deplore them. As to
the part which predisposition plays in drinking, it is
hardly possible to express a definite opinion. Not a few
people, fortunately for them, are just as incapable of
taking to drink, no matter what their temptations may
be, as others are prone to it. To me alcohol is really dis-
tasteful, although, in the interests of good-fellowship, I
have given it many trials. I ought to have been a rabid
teetotal lecturer, “ instead of w'hich ” as the good old
judge put it, Nature has cursed me with an inquiring
mind, a predisposition to which I am as much a victim as
the habitual drunkard is to his.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“A Gaol Chaplain” on Flogging.
A person subscribing himself “A Gaol Chap-
lain” writes to the S.M. Herald recommend-
ing copious and enthusiastic floggings as a
remedy for larrikinism. Also, he wants the
floggings administered five minutes or so after
conviction, so that if the law has got hold of
the wrong larrikin there may be no time to dis-
cover the mistake ; and he doesn’t want the
offender sent to prison—where “ A Gaol Chap-
lain ” can minister to his soul—at all, from
which it would seem that he finds himself
unequal to saving brands from the burning,
and thinks it would be a lot easier simply to
flog the brand, and turn him loose in all his
original wickedness. There is food for much
reflection in all this. God put skin on man, and
His humble follower, the “Gaol Chaplain,’’wants
to take it off. Being a chaplain he necessarily
regards the matter from a spiritual standpoint,
and his utterance evidently means that he finds
preaching ineffectual as a means of saving
souls, and wants to try flaying instead. If this
device is effectual as a means of redemption,
then The Bulletin is of opinion that it ought
to be tried all round ; it is certainly better
that a fashionable congregation, for instance,
should be whaled in this world than that it
should be lost in the next, and as preaching
seems woefully ineffectual, it might possibly be
a good idea to omit the customary sermon, and
simply flog the congregation twice on Sun-
day, and then take up a collection. This
theory, of course, is based on the natural
assumption that “ A Gaol Chaplain ” re-
gards the sudden removal of the outer
cuticle as a means of grace —in which case, by
the way, he ought to do the flogging himself,
the means of grace being distinctly his special
department. And, if he doesn’t so regard it,
and merely recommends it as a substitute for
confinement under the blessed influence of his
ministrations in order to save trouble, then, in
that case also, he ought to do it himself. He
is paid by the State to show every prisoner the
evil of his ways, and if 30 or 40 per cent, of his
work is taken off his shoulders by his proposed
system, then it seems only reasonable that lie
should fill in his time with flogging. More-
over, if he wasn’t willing to do the flogging
himself, he shouldn’t recommend it ; and
if he is too fat and flabby and short-winded
to make skin and blood fly in the orthodox
Botany Bay manner, he should stand aside
and make room for a younger and more
muscular apostle. Further, seeing that
the chaplain in question evidently regards
the cat as a good and honourable thing. The
Bulletin would like to know if he habitually
shakes hands with the official who uses that
implement when he meets him, and treats him
as a man and a brother, for, if not, then he
doesn’t live up to his professions. If a man
demands that a certain thing be done, and
won’t do it himself, and looks down on the
person who does it, then he is several varieties
of a skunk. Lastly, this paper would like to
know that chaplain’s conscientious opinion
about the hangman and the fiogger’s prospects
in the great hereafter ; and it asks him if, when
he buries the deceased cat-artist, and alludes to
him as a brother who is planted in the sure and
certain hope of a blessed resurrection, he really
and truly hopes to sit alongside of and chum
up with a glorified flogger in the fields of
Asphodel ? Amen.

Labour-Force a Commodity.
Dear Bulletin, —Bishop Ooe was perfectly, if
cold-bloodedly, correct when he stated at the
annual meeting of the Charity Organisation
Society that labour was only a commodity ;
under existing conditions it is nought else. His
deduction, however, was as perfectly illogical:
it is just because labour is a commodity, if on
no higher grounds, that the seller is justified in
selling it at the best possible price. As Las-
salle put the matter when describing the
“ Iron Law of Wages ” to the Frankfort
labourers :
You believe, perhaps, fellow-citizens, that you are
human beings—that you are men. Speaking from the
standpoint of political economy, you make a terrible
mistake. Speaking from the standpoint of political
economy, you are nothing but a commodity, a high price
tor which increases your numbers, just as a high price for
stockings increases the number of stockings, if there are
not enough of them ; while you are swept away, your
number is diminished by smaller wages, just as if you were
vermin against which society wages war.
If the labourers of this country be business men,
they will not imagine that the monopolists look
at the wages question from a sentimental point
of view, and, looking at it from a practical point
of view themselves, will take the advice of Karl
Marx in his workman’s appeal for a normal
working-day and be “ saving,” as they are often
advised to lie, by the godly and stingy. Saving,
yes ; but not of their money—of their bodily
powers. They will see that the employer does
not exhaust a vitality which should represent
thirty years endurance inside ten years at ten
years' purchase, thus thieving two-thirds of
their labour-force and making no monetary
return.—-Yours, George Black.

The Wages of Slaver.
.The sort of encouragement which literary
eminence meets with from Governments in
Great Britain has been brought into high relief
by the distribution of so-called honours by the
out-going Premier. Not a single writer has
shared in the shower of “ honorary ” distinc-
tion. It seems not to have occurred to Salis-
bury to distinguish for the admiration of the
nation a single individual among the men whose
talents as journalists have been devoted towards
emphasising the merits and extenuating the
defects of his Administration. As for the
litterateurs, as distinguished from the jour-
nalists, these have been similarly neglected.
All his consideration has been absorbed by the
fat proprietors of the daily journals, persons
among whom not an individual selected by him
for titular distinction lias ever evinced the
faintest indication of literary gifts. It is coolly
assumed that the bestowal of titles upon men
who wade in advertisements and grow rich by
thattraffic and by the profits derived from sweat-
ing writers and compositors, is equivalent to a
“ recognition of literature.” The tuft-hnnting
Lawson alias Levy, the Jew who is ashamed of
his race, is a type of all the rest—the Jaffrays,
the Captain Armstrongs— suggestive name !
the Borthwicks, are all proprietors of news-
papers, and not one has ever written anything
notable. Even Queen Victoria has done better
than that in conferring a peerage on the
courtier-laureate Tennyson, and a knighthood
on Arthur lady-HELPS who patched up the
grammar and spelling of her own “reminis-
cences.” The dignity business is running to
seed altogether. The ideal is to elevate for
admiration the noblest of their generation, the
real is to barter titles for a consideration. The
peerages are mostly sold to enterprising specu-
lators who make heavy investments in the
electioneering funds of their party, and
the small-goods are awarded to sycophants,
turn-coats, and other vermin. Sometimes it is
a nigger, some Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, or a
Chow like Whampoa, of the Straits Settle-
ments, and sometimes a bogus Republican like
Dibbs who swaps his loudly-proclaimed Repub-
licanism for a Jamsetjee-ship. There seems to
be a merciful Providence watching over Demo-
cratic aspirations. Were a sovereign once to
catch hold of the idea of confining the bestowal
of titles to persons really distinguished by their
abilities or their merit, the Democratic and
Republican propaganda would receive a fearful
set-back. But, thanks to an overruling Provi-
dence, some lying spirit is let loose to bam-
boozle monarchs and Ministers, and to put
it into their heads to pick john davies and
r. b. smith and the like for special honour. And
the latest welcome move in this direction is,
according to recent indications, that Her
Majesty will be advised that there is no man
in Australia so fit to be grappled to her
soul as that noble and superbly gifted being,
Dr. renwick.
Some more “Thin Edge of the Wedge.”
Some time ago a measure was passed in New
South Wales, providing for the adoption—to a
very small and limited extent —of the “ better-
ment ” principle in the construction of public
v/orks. It was passed because the Legislature
decided that the principle was just and neces-
sary, and it was restricted in obedience to the
old cant wheeze which asserts that it is sound
statesmanship always to start with the thin
end of the wedge, and not remove the whole of
an old, condemned tumor at once, lest the nation
should wake up in the night and cry for its
lost disease. Minister Lyne, it is now an-
nounced, has a bill on hand providing for
a further extension of this principle, and
The Bulletin trusts that on this occasion
the New South Wales Government will adopt
the whole principle in one act—one-sixth of a
principle is of no special value to anybody.
The one thing that the people of Australia
should never forget is that, for want of this
system in the past, something like £100,000,000
has been utterly fooled away. The theory on
which it is based is that the capitalist whose
property is enhanced in value by Government
works should pay to the State a proportion of
the profit which the State thus creates for him.
As the additional value is created entirely by
the nation it is justly entitled to take it all,
bub if it merely annexes 75 per cent, of tha
amount, and m'akes the ungrateful landlord a
free gift of the balance, it is possible to raisv
enough to build almost all the public works of
the future without floating another loan
from now to the end of futurity. The
system of borrowing a million to construct a
railway which thereby adds, probably, a million
and a half to the value of adjacent lands for the
benefit of some gilded absentee is too insane to
require comment. What the country demands
is that the betterment principle shall be
adopted whole—that when any Government or
municipal work enhances the value of private
property, whether to the extent of £5 or
£5,000,000, the State shall annex a certain
fixed proportion, and a large one, of that
increased value for public purposes. If the
amount thus taxed exceeds the amount spent
upon the wont, so much the better for the
State. It is conceivable, under some circum-
stances, that an undertaking which cost only
£500,000 might add £1.000,000 to adjacent
values, and in such a case, on the 75 per cent,
basis, the nation would possess an asset worth
half-a-million which cost it nothing, it would be
£250,000 in pocket—and the adjoining land-
lords would have received £250,000 for nothing,
which is much more than sufficient for any
body of landlords.
Old Billy Brooks, of Brisbane, now an
Honorable, and ascended to the Upper House,
where so many good ironmongers go, has of late
become a bit of a Tory, but he used to be in the
front of the battle against the Kanaka slave-
trade what time Sam. Griffith was the David
of the anti-Kanak host; and his gorge has
risen nearly through the top of his head at the
pro-nigger-stealing dispatch of Governor Nor-
man. Writes the Governor :
The opposition to the reintroduction of black-labour in
the colony has not been and has been mainly con-
fined to general denunciations by ministers of religion or
others, and to the efforts made to prevent any action
which may directly or indirectly be supposed to tend to
lower the high rates of wages which now obtain in
Queensland.
Billy writes to Brisbane Courier denouncing
this as “a disrespectful and incautious sen-
tence,I’and 1 ’ and says the “ opinions are so wide of
universally known facts as to be positively mis-
leading ” which appears to be a rather round-
about periphrasis for “ confounded lies.” Wil-
liam also remarks, with respect to the Gover-
nor’s sentence that “ I am lead to believe that
there would be much opposition at the present
time to the importation of Asiatics into the
colony,” that—
When his Excellency lias to be led up to a belief that
the sun shines every day at noon, it sets one asking, is
there no friend who can venture to suggest to his Excel-
lency that he write no more despatches about black-labour
until the general election is Over?
And appears to think that while each holding
one of his Excellency’s ears open, Griffith and
MTlwraith manage to have a hand to spare
for his vice-regal nose.

Editor Fitchett, in the alleged Australian
Review of Reviews, remarks that the ridicule
heaped on Sir G. Republican Dibbs for accept-
ing a title is “not at all sensible,” and proceeds
to illustrate his idea that titles are “ not incom-
patible with even the drab simplicity of a repub-
lic ” by asserting that be counted 2(X) decorous
persons sitting in a Parisian park one sunny
afternoon, and that there are more “ Colonels,”
“ Judges,” and “ Senators ” to the square mile
in the United States than in any other country
on earth. It does not suit the acute-minded
Mr. Fitchett to perceive the difference
between the action of the avowed Repub-
lican accepting a tifcie ‘at the hands of a
Monarchy—and that the very Monarchy against
which his sentiments were addressed—and the
American colonel, whose title is often a
sobriquet, or the decorated Frenchman, whose
badge of honour is the symbol of the Republic’s
appreciation of some service done for the
Republic. “A sensible man accepts the usages
of the social system to which he belongs,” says
the Fitchett, in defending the apostacy of the
Dibbs. Beautiful laisser-faire ! If “ sensible ”
were synonymous with fatness, comfort,
bourgeois respectability, and blind, callous
indifference to the feelings and fortunes of
neighbours and brothers, there would be a little
reason and lots of truth in the pompous
generalisation of our reverend coutemporarv.

Says Melbourne Am;us :
The State is in admittedly an awkward position as rail-
way owner, since it must face competition in some
quarters. It should he entitled to make every reasonable
effort to secure business, hut when it goes beyond reason
it does serious injustice. In the first place, the com-
petitor suffers a twofold wrong. He is driven off the road
or water as the case may he, thereby losing trade; and
he also, as a unit in the community, has to pay his share
of the railway deficit caused by the cutting down of rates.
From these statements the Conservative hurdy-
gurdy deduces the conclusion that the State has
no right to compete with private carriers
because that involves “suppression of private
enterprise by Government.” We look at it the
other way : the private individual has no right
to compete with Governments in the mighty
enterprises which some Stales think right to
handle for fear of gigantic monopolies laying
hold of them. If rates are cut down it should
be for the general good ; cut down they should
bo to the very lowest limit that will pay
interest on expenditure and replace worn-out
capital. The State is no prolit-mongering
machine.
Dear Bulletin, —Six years ago I was pot-
sticking at a Balmoral River (Q.) wool scour, and
heard the squatter congratulate himself on the
success of theWolseley sheep-shearing machines,
then on trial, which would, he said, make shearing
of the future contract-work, with probably Chinese
at weekly wages. This has not been verified, but,
judging from the utterances of a prominent sheep-
breeder at the recent pastoralists’ meeting in
Sydney, a move may shortly be made. The
speaker, referring to present rates, said the price
for machine-shearing should be fixed on a different
basis, as the extras in supplying the motive-power,
&c., brought the cost up to 255. to 275. (id. per 100.
Which means that machine-shearers will be asked
to concede the extras. As the inventors claim a
gain of several ozs. wool for every sheep shorn by
their machines as compared with hand-shearing,
one would think the wool-kings might thus balance
their ledgers. But no mention was made of heavier
clips at the meeting, although it was emphasised
that the machines lightened the toil of the shearer.

810 Macquarie-slreet North, Sydney, August 31,189?.
My Dkar Moorabinua,—
Lady Charles Scott, in a pearl-grey silk, completely
covered with black lace and topped oft by a black coronet
toque with a spray of myrtle, opened N.S.W. Horticul-
tural Society’s daffodil and camellia show, held in Sydney
Y.M.C.A. hall, the other Friday. “Rule Britannia” is
the air that warns you the Admiraless is coming, so, of
course, the proceedings opened with it, and everybody
remarked that Lady S. walked up the aisle unassisted
and not on the arm of a committee-man, which is the
“properest thing to do.”
I hope the Horticultural Society won’t encore the
experiment of having a floral contest in the tiny Y.M.C.A.
The crowd (a small one on half-crown day, owing to
uncertain weather) positively jostled one another, and I
am sure the exhibits suffered from people catching in the
top branches as they passed. The pieces de resistance-
daffodils —were very fine, and they had romantic names,
too—the only clumsy cognomen I saw was “ William
Wilks.” But, after all, naming different species of the
same flower is very like christening each grape in a
cluster. One petal tilts to the left instead of the right,
and the Susannah Jane becomes the Ethel Maude—but
only a perfect dab at green-stuff could tell them apart.
I stood beside a fierce, military-looking old gentleman,
and he read the names, “Grande Monarque” and “ La
reine Jaune,” on what looked like the same flower.
“ Well, I’ll be shot,” quoth he, “ if I can see any differ-
ence !” And I couldn’t, either.
The flower-show revealed nothing gaspingly lovely in
the clothes line. Sassiety is doing the usual chrysalis act
before the Spring dress parade. One long black sacque
coat with Watteau back and collar hanging out like the
lip of a pint-pot was nobbily worn by a slim blonde with a
decided “jag on,” as Billy Emerson says. Somebody
sported an Eton jacket in dark-blue serge. Also Sjdney’s
lady medico was there in a serge coat and a pink dickey,
and her hands in her pockets—as usual.
By the way, there were one or two displays of bush
flowers at the show, and I was secretly much amused at
the spectacle of several women taking eager notes of the
Latin names of the fuzzy, scrubby anscmic-looking shrubs
which garland Australia. They had an eye to coming out
strong at ensuing summer picnics, I suppose. “ Will you
be good enough to pluck mo a bloom of that beautiful
care canem pro bono publico, Mr. Jones?” she will say
with an airy wave towards a common bottle-brush.
Emerson’s minstrels, at the Garrick, attracted an
audience the night I smiled upon the entertainment,
which reminded one of the crowds that used to back up
J.L.T.—old stagers, you know, have a perfect mania
for being wafted back a hundred years more or less. There
are one or two silvery tenors in the troupe, and, if they
would only pipe something more reasonable than curdled
sentiments about meeting Nell in a dell, how you never
can tell how you love her so well, the dress circle would
be truly grateful. One thing I liked about Emerson’s
minstrels—none of the jokes are broad enough to send
even the most modest maiden behind her fan, so papa
can take the girls without a moment’s hesitation.
People who stopped at the same Hobart hash-house as
“ Lord and Lady Leamington,” say that the airs and
graces of these amusing humbugs were quite up to
peerage-pitch. One day “ her ladyship ” was idly strum-
ming on the drawing-rocm piano (possibly, “ Sparkling
wine! gift of the gods above, boys!” which she used to
sing in such pretty tights in the ’mime), when a vehicle
drove up to the door. “Is that our carriage, deah?”
asked she of Lord L., who was looking out of the window.
“ Some people might call it a cawwidge, pet,” he replied,
“ but it’s not one you would dwive in !”
Talking of airs and graces, reminds me that the anti-
Australian Anglo-Indian still infests the high sea between
London and Bombay, and shows no signs of abating half-
an-inch of his curry-coloured sneer when anything which
has cut its teeth on a corn-cob is seen following its
luggage up the gangway. Quite recently, on a mail*
steamer coming this way, two rather puckered and
liverish-looking Anglo-Indiennes were observed at table
on the second day out Jo shiver as if stricken with
paralysis, then glare in a maniacal manner at their
fellow - passengers, as if seeking for some visage as
bilious as their own. And, on finding it not, they rose
precipitately and fled, making uncharitable remarks on
the utter impossibility of dining with Australians as the
went 1
Not that I am hotly indignant against these ladies—
for, bless you, it all depends on what “ representative ”
was stoking provender into himself with both hands on
the blade of his pen-knife at the moment when their
feelings overcame them. I have sat up aloft in
galleries and watched my countrymen experiencing the
pleasures of the table, and I’ll make a solemn affidavit (if
anybody will show me how) that at an altitude of forty
feet I have distinctly heard the soup-suction.
The funniest thing on ship-board—on the big, gilded,
be-caipeted mail-boats, I mean—must be the crony
dinners that spring up every now and again. Elaborate
invitations go forth and are elaborately accepted, and the
passengers “ not in it ” feel very much out of it for days
previously. But when the evening comes the guests form
a party at a separate table in the saloon, and feed from
the same menu as the rest of the passengers. It seem-
ingly doesn’t take much to amuse people on the boring
briny.
Harping on maritime subjects—l wonder if it ever
occurs to the aspirant for the fatal position of a brass-
buttoned anything on a mail-boat what a Father Know-
All he has got to be? Besides boxing the compass and
lying the wheel he must know how to be a fascinating
llirl—a bon-t n ant—and a variety actor. Especially the
last, if he wants to run an amusing ship. In every fin-
officer’s kit there are two or three complete
theatrical costumes, and when the fun shows signs of
flagging he dons the torn coat of “ Killaloe” or the smut-
covered apparel of the “Bogie Man,” and does his turn
to keep the ship awake. If industry and strict attention
to all sorts of business merit reward the tars that o’er
the ocean sail well deserve all the hugs they’re supposed
to get.
What a rooted habit the average Britisher has of
alluding to everything as “my,” even though his sole
worldly asset is a paper - collar ! One noble lord’s
relation in Australia is quite noted for his extreme
progressiveness, although most of the things he deals
with belong to somebody else. The other day he went
forth on a borrowed animal with a loaned gun to shoot
something—but this is how he put it: “I was making
towards my home on my mare when I saw an eagle-hawk.
I galloped my mare home—got my gun—but found the
hawk had flown.” It was the same individual who once
roused a country house in the small hours, and when
everybody pelted to the spot coolly told the foremost
person “to be sure—in the morning—to serve my potatoes
in their jackets ! ”
This month the Spring gaieties commence. The A. J.C.
meet begins on 10th inst. Two Governors, Hopetoun and
Norman, with their wives and suites, are to stay with
Lord and Lady Jersey during the races. There will be
balls on the 14th, loth, and 16th insts., Mayor and
Mayoress Manning leading off in the Town Hall, Govern-
ment House second, the Union Club third. The Medical
Congress will also enliven matters, and I feel glad to hear
that the deeply scientific and improving Royal Society of
N.S.W. intend entertaining the itinerant medicine-men at
a conversazione in the great hall of the University. That
is the whole extent of the Spring whirligig, I believe, with
the addition of big dances and little dinners and all that
sort of thing.
N.S.W. Art Society’s annual exhibition will be formally
opened by Lord Jersey on sth inst., but the fun really
begins at the private view on Saturday, 3rd inst. The
show will be a regular bumper of art this Spring. I hear
that the hanging committee have worn themselves out
trying to give everybody a good peg, and with 305 ex
hi bits (a baker’s dozen of which are works of sculpture)
and the very meagre wall-space at their disposal, one can
easily imagine how exciting their task has been.
The “management” of a desperately insolvent Queens-
land church hit on an ingenious plan to galvanize the
bank-account, so I’m told. They begged a huge cake
from a member of the congregation, and induced five bar*
maids (one from each local shanty) to be candidates for
it—the result to be decided by ballot—each voter paying
a shilling for the privilege of putting Tottie at the top
of the poll. The ladies canvassed so alluringly that the
original issue of 150 tickets was raised to 1000, and in the
end the church made £5O out of a mere hunk of dough
and plums, with a 999-to-l chance you don’t get it. The
hook-nosed sweep-promoter had better look to it, or the
church will cut him out in the running.
Churches have the coolest way of grabbing that the
world has ever sum. Somebody’s servant came from the
family’s place of worship, the other Sunday, and solemnly
infoimed her master that he bad been “assessed” by his
spiritual guardians at £5O, and that she, Mary, had been
assessed at £5. And both had to pay up merrily, too—or
else be cast into the outer darkness.
Myra Kembles “New Magdalen,” at the Imperial
Opera House, was a strikingly repentant female with a
very convincing sob—but only one frock worth a gasp
an electric-blue silk shrouded in figured grenadine. Miss
Kemble’s face make-up was very artist’c, and Mrs. Moly-
neux as the vindictive female had (suitably enough) fixeel
her childish visage up to look as if she had been buried
alive in early yOulh. Also, Annie Taylor had a poodle-
skin wig on—which strikes me as being a capital idea for
the doggy old woman who likes to preserve Fido’a
memory. Turn the darling creature’s tail into a frisettc.
Features of the d.c., on the night I was there, were a
man with a bull voice, who expressed his opinion of the
show at praiiie-pitch, and a see-more charmer, in black
and pink, who wore her long bare arms peeled to Ihe very
finger-tips. Of coursv her fingers glittered with much
diamond and sapphire splendour (she spent every interval
scratching herself musingly cn the “cleared patches ” so
to speak), and she sported more bracelets than a Nautch
girl; yet,in spite of nil the glitter, she ought to have stuck
to gloves. Her bands were as red as raddK
And even should it become the correct thing to go out
with uncovered hands it won’t be such a saving, after all.
The same as when mittens-cheaper on the surface—used
to rage, for evening wear, not so very long ago. Your
fashionable woman simply had to have one or two
sparkling rings gleaming softly through the s’iken meshes.
The “usher of the black rod” (who might he
arrested for having no visible means of support
when he gets those historic hosen on) presented the
only novelty at the opening of N.S.W. Parliament, on
Tuesday; he had his little snicker snee hanging by a
white sash. Nothing else electrified one, for the crowd
of women had on ancient frockery—besides which the
chamber was full of fog and (another besides) women
don’t dress up to the nines for the opening of the Talkee-
Talkee. They leave all the glory to the high officials,
from the Governor (the more gold lace and ostrich-feather
and kid gloves you pile on to Jersey the better he looks)
in all his glory, to the smallest usher marching with his
billiard-cue up and down the coir matting.
But the Ms.L.A. (who are like a Parliamentary circus
as it were) aren’t very stylish—in fact, only the star parts
dress. On the Legislative Assembly chairs there was a
regular sartorial Babel. Mr. Toohey alone had aspring
flower in his coat; one or two had full starchy war-paint
(it looks so waiter-like by daylight); others (including
Minister Slattery) got up an incongruity between Sunday-
go-to-meetings and swallow-tail; and several sported
“ morning dress,” which is a polite way of saying that
they had nothing on that matched.
1 want to suggest a change in opera-staging. There is
one auburn-haired, pretty-I’olly visaged chorister, who is
always first to lead on the frantic mob, or the happy
peasants, or the blythe and merry flower-sellers. She is
the pioneer of the “stipes ” in every outbreak, and she
wears her own red hair all the time, and, in a vague way,
everybody is getting tired of her. A mob that is always
headed by one carrot-topped individual is handicapped by
always seeming to be the same mob, no matter what sort
of mob it’s s'U'poscd to be.

John Struck Oil Williamson saw fit to
resurrect the merry “Pepita” at Her Majesty’s
(Sydney) on Saturday, and, judging by the howls
of a crowded gallery, the suppressed chuckles of
a pressed-down and running-over dress-circle and
the shrieks of the surging stalls, the operatic
corpse was galvanised at the right moment. Yet
Flora Graupner, as Pepita (too solemnly in earnest
everywhere to give a playful rendering of a charac-
ter that easily degenerates into shrewishness),
forced her warble right through, with the inevit-
able result that she was sometimes fully half a tone
out. Her castanet solo was very much so-so, and
the stirring toreador song sounded as if she was
merely asking somebody to pass the butter,
please. Leumane’s Inigo was the same Inigo
to a dot —a little fatter as becomes the
placid agriculturist—or perhaps it was corn-
cobs in the gullet that made his infrequent vocal
opportunities sound as if he was choking. As
Pataques, Lauri scored heavily in the duet in act
two, though he didn’t look such a cocky little
warrior as Elton used to—but, then, the gigantic
Marnock, with his aggravating tremolo, was the
“ Bombardos ” of other days—and Ryley—lovely
youth ! —though he goes up high enough, didn’t
fit Bombardos’s clothes horizontally. Violet
Varley and Howard Vernon (Inez and Pedrillo)
deserve a lot of nice remarks which they are not
going to get, and the rest of the billed people may
continue to think that the interest centred round
them individually for all The Bulletin cares.
Fireworks in a coal-cellar only feebly expresses

A noticeable feature about the “Pepita”
revival was the way in which Flora Graupner
(who seemed tired out) plucked up heart in tights
and lost it again in petticoats—though it’s gene-
rally the other way round. In the fetching cadet
uniform (which also set off Varley’s rounded form
like a little model of a doosid fine woman, you
know) and the gorgeous black-and-gold bull-
fighter’s rig, the fair Flora got quite perky. But
a return to petticoats sobered her instantly, and
the queen scene (how all of ’em do love to stalk
round with ten yards of stuff hanging off behind,
and a tin crown on) could have occurred in any
well-regulated tragedy. By the way, Flora ought
to learn the use and abuse of the sword-scabbard.
Half the time when she sported a skewer she
dropped the sheath, and the devoted chorus had

to reach after it surreptitiously with their feet, so
that it mightn’t rise up and smite her in her reck-
less pas-scut.

The Spanish ballot in Satanic colours in
the last act was a very special bit of kicking, and
the frocks shone out (like Leumane’s first-act
breeches) which were apparently the cut of a
Union Jack. Also, the head-gear Varley wore
first was reminiscent of argumentative Woolloo-
mooloo belledom at the critical juncture when the
bonnet is cocked —but Violet loqked very trimly
harnessed in the red and blue vivandiere array—
the costume the kitchen-] I 'rench occurs in. Which
reminds one that Graupner should look up the
’nunciation of “ dour ” very carefully indeed.

What is the matter with the frantic ad-
mirers of the warbling divinities where have all
the bouquets got to? Night in, night out, the
leading ladies trill and ogle and point their toes
at the orchestra, but never a daisy whistles over
Caron’s head, and why all the florists in town
aren’t insolvent is a puzzle. And even the old
familiar “ managerials ” —stagey enough to be
fashioned of wool or paper—have ceased fluttering
unconvincingly over the footlights. Has there
been a managerial edict; “All garden-stuff to bo
shot at the stage-door ?”

The “New Magdalen” was revived at
Sydney Opera House, on Saturday night, in the
presence of a rather enthusiastic audience. There
is a certain amount of realism in Wilkie Collins’
drama, but not much, and it is always the unreal
parts that the audience principally whoops f o i
The realism consists of the lost Magdalen herself
—or it would do so if she continued lost— th
woman who is talked to death by respectable hatra*
furies, and spinsters, and assaulted with the birr’
hard-bound Bible of the brassy preacher and
walked upon by the wild asses of piety’ and
whose thorny resting-place is on the gimlet of the
Social Purity Society, and who is haunted bv
fierce Christians with darns in their language who
want to half-sole her morals. The unreal part
consists principally of the curate, who" has* a
tendency to deliver impassioned sermons to the
audience on every possible occasion, and some-
how this curate always brings down the
house, and his oiliest exhortation generally
fetches an encore. Miss Myra Kemble as
the Magdalen,, ought to be the principal attrac-
tion, but she isn’t. She plays the part in artistic
fashion—that is to say, she does it like a female
haunted by horrors and evil spirits, and after the
fashion of stage conspirators in general she sits up
violently at every falling leaf, and is so obviously
waiting for the deluge that only a particularly
blind old peeress could be taken in by her. If she
played it in any other fashion, however the
audience would probably rise at her with indigna-
tion, for it is a recognised fact that the stage
conspirator must always be known by the way his
or her hair stands up in constant apprehen-
sion all through three acts. Also Miss Kemble
throws off the conspirator, and rises bril-
liantly to the occasion on the only two occa-
sions where there is any occasion to rise
to. Mrs. Molyneux plays the part of Grace
Roseberry in the only way the character admits
of—as a hard, spiky British maiden of unblemished
ferocity ; but the public interest seems to centre
principally round Mr. A. R. Lawrence’s curate.
Why it should do so no one knows, for the curate
is unreal and long-winded, and there never was
and never will be such an individual until the
Established Church pales its ineffectual collection-
plate, and fades away. Mr. Lawrence saves the
healthy-looking preacher from being absolutely
ridiculous, but no man could do much more. The
long-lost Frank Cates does some good work as
Horace Holmcroft, the aristocratic Podsnap
of the drama; and Lady Janet Roy is
rendered by Miss Annie Taylor in a respectable
fashion which calls for no special comment.
The “ New Magdalen ” is a play which makes the
audience feel good, and there were sundry damp
spots in the dress-circle on Saturday night where
various impressionable females had been shedding
the tear of silent sympathy and thinking of the
Christian attitude they would have assumed if they
met the prodigal daughter in real life. Also one
stout gentleman was visibly affected. He owns two
terraces which are all let to “ unfortunates” at
rack rents, and he calls round like a devouring
pestilence every week for the money. Judging by
liis contrite appearance lie probably raised the rent
first thing on the ensuing Monday morning. “A
Peer of the Realm” is in preparation.
The “ Alabama Minstrels,”
at Sydney Garrick, keep improv-
ing on further inspection. Their
1 wo comedians, Billy Emerson and
G. 11. Wood, have a fatal ten-
dency to become really comic in
(heir unguarded moments, and
now and then original jokes burst
out of them in a manner which
oversets all the traditions of the
minstrel bu iness. This dangerous
leaning towards humour is mostly
confined to the Garrick, however,
and there are no special manifes-
tations of it at any other place of
amusement at present. The
Gyclorama and one or two othgr
solemn trifles of thesame ordercon-
linue on their track as heretofore,
and the smaller shows of the city
are still keeping out of the Benevo-
lent Asylum.

Madame Roth, of whom a
portrait is printed in this issue of
The Bulletin, arrived in N.S.W.
about seven years ago, intend-
ing to devote her time exclusively
to decorative art. Finding no
field in that direction, she turned
her attention to teaching, and with
great success. In spite of her time
being almost fully occupied by her
pupils, she was a constant ex-
hibitor at the current exhibitions.
Some time ago the trustees of
N.S.W. National Gallery pur-
chased a piece of her decorative
work, and in the water-colour
landscape competition last year
she was one of the five artists
whose work was chosen as illus-
trative of the scenery of the province. Madame
Roth has left cn route for New York, where she
hopes to find scope for her favourite pursuit,
decoration, and with this idea in view has pre-
pared a series of thirty or forty sketches of
Australian subjects, chiefly birds and flowers.
Madame Roth takes with her the good wishes of
many friends.

Mr. H. R. Jewett indulged in the luxury
of a benefit at Sydney Garrick on Monday, when
a programme was presented which was at least a
yard too long for the available space. The prin-
cipal features were one act of “ My Partner,” in
which the divine George Rignold appeared in the
character of Joe Saunders, one act of “Ihe
Judge ” by Myra Kemble and her company, and
an extract from the “ Corsican Brothers,” in all of
which Mr. Jewett took a hand. The rest of the
show consisted of fourteen different items, con-
tributed by Misses Jennie Lee, Emma Wangen-
heim, Viola Fortescue, Messrs. Howard "V ernon,
Geo. L. Gordon, Shine, Geo. Walton, and other
artists, who evidently meant well, and unduly
lengthened the show with no sinister intent.

The time when five Melbourne theatres

eight thousand people rolled up to support the
drama every Saturday night, is getting to be a
good old time. Managers sigh as they thinK

the “theatre-party nuisance” was almost more

u The Silver King” enjoys a monopoly of
serious business at the Princess’, and Walter
Bentley shakes his snowy mane to the evident
satisfaction of large audiences. Also his perform-
ance of the name-part has grown somewhat
stronger at the knees and more harmonious than
at first. He still gets too drunk in the first act,
and too violently sober in the next, and too full of
ioyful hope in a resurrection when he finds that
he is dead. Put he comes back to England in
better condition and less like a mine-owner in
holy orders, so that the two halves of Wilfrid
Denver’s career seem to hang together by the
thread of the narrative. There are evidences of
a rising to higher things elsewhere. Sass and
Royce were excellent from the start, but George
Carey, as Father Christmas, has been able to fur-
nish and decorate his room for improvement during
the past week. Miss Watson, too, becomes a more
convincing Nellie Denver every night. In a quiet
sort of way Miss Watson is a better exponent of
this charming part than either of her predecessors,
who hadn’t such particular natural qualifications
for it. Corlesse gives a finished sketch of Cripps
the Cracksman, ' and Miss Gwynne reveals _ a
hitherto unsuggested depth of character in Susie,
the pretty waitress at “ The Checkers.” No other
Susie has betrayed such a splendid capacity for
loving a sailor, or so much womanly disappoint-
ment” anger, and disgust when the sailor doesn’t
reciprocate. This Susie is of infinite value to the
play, inasmuch as she makes silent confession that
Wilfrid Denver is the only case in which she has
ever known herself to fail. Her beauty sharpens
the point of the lesson. Everything is possible to
a man who refrains from kissing Susie.

The Bijou has been doing very well with
“Confusion,” and on Monday last the story of
the pug was supplemented by a local “skit,” in
one act, entitled “The Landslip.” If Brough,
made up after the image of Matthew Davies,
scores a success in this topical illusion it will
certainly be wanted again, and noticed in The
Bulletin anon. Meanwhile the B. and B. inten-
tion is to produce “A Village Priest,” five-act
drama by Sydney Grundy, on Saturday. This
play is said to be a howler, and anything in the
way of a substantial novelty may expect a cordial
reception under present circumstances.

fit at their former shop on Saturday, whilst Mr,
and Mrs. Royce are said to have similar intentions
as regards themselves. The term benefit has no
charitable flavour about it in this latter case, how-
ever. Royce doesn’t positively need another bene-
fit as far as anybody knows, and one cannot help
regretting that the still small voices of forgotten
favourites in distress should be drowned by the
personal appeals of prosperous artists,

north than Rockhampton, as ho lias to-be back in

judging by our remembrance of Mrs. Darrell, she would

Connie Gilchrist, at her wedding with the Earl of
Orkney, really looked her best, says The Bulletin’s
London correspondent. She was dressed in grey-shot
corded silk with very wide sleeves of green velvet, and
epaulettes of lace which fell in graceful folds down to the
elbows. Her hat was a ravishing creation—fight straw
with a crinkled brim, and trimmed with lovely roses.
Altogether she looked most fetching, and well might her
very dear friend, the old Duke of Guiseberry, who gave
her away, look sad at the idea of parting with her. > There
were very few friends present. D’Arcy didn’t come
to see liis quondam flame (upon whom he lavished so
many diamonds) turned off. But D’Arcy is now too much
absorbed in politics to care for lovely woman. Besides,
he has a wife much older than himself who looks after
him. She is an Australian, and knows how to keep a man
in order. It is said that Connie’s dot was £30,000, which,
of course, was provided by Papa Beaufort.
A letter from Geo. W. Anson is jubilant with engage-
ments and rumours of engagements. Geo. W. has been
offered his pick of three scrumptious parts in
a comic opera to be shortly produced. Geo.
Barrett and our old friend “Billy” Elton are already
secured for the same production. Anson is also making
arrangements for a season of Eccles ac London Garrick,
and he has already disposed of tins American rights of a
comedy written by himself and Geo. Lash Gordon. A
London production of this comedy is, by the way, under
negotiation. Altogether the “Only” Anson is on a
gentle boom, and considers that nothing does an actor’s
standing so much good in the “Old Country as a suc-
cessful Australian sojourn. This, moreover, appears to
be true of all actors who have enjoyed good seasons in
the “ kawlinies”—all, at least, except Bellew.
Melbourne Herald, in an oracular theatrical column,
deplores the stupidity of a correspondent who wanted to
know whether George Rignold ever appeared in “ A
Run of Luck.” “It is odd,” observes the Herald,
“ that the play-going public do not even yet under-
stand that the Australian right in pieces belongs ex-
clusively to the managers who buy them. ‘ A Run of
Luck’ belongs to Bland Holt, just as ‘ The Gondoliers ’
belongs to J. C. Williamson, ‘ Dr. Bill ’ to Miss Myra
Kemble, and ‘Paul Jones’ to Miss Nellie Stewart. Mr.
George Rignold. therefore, has no chance of playing the
hero of any of these pieces even if his desires run in that
direction.’’’ George as the hero of a comic opera, or as
Dr Bill is a rather wild possibility, one must admit. But
it happened that he was specially engaged to appear in
the first production of “A Run of Luck ” at Melbourne
Royal. Wherefore, &c.
It is related that when Henry Herman, the dramatist,
was in the heyday of his success and was scooping in
about £2OO a week with the “Silver King” and other-
plays he was most extravagant in his expenditure and
used to give a dinner every Sunday which must have cost
close on £lOO. His friends remonstrated with him in
vain. “Aprbs moi le deluge,” was his reply. But Mrs.
Conover helped to cure him. On one occasion he was
tfivinof a specially grand spread—it was in January—and
he went to Covent Garden and bought three quarts of
new orcen peas at four guineas a quart. Everybody, cf
course, enjoyed them, especially Mrs. Conover, _ who
turned to Herman and said: “ Those ftre the finest tinned
veas I have ever eaten in my life, Mr. Herman. Where
do you get them ?” He never gave another dinner.

Walter Bentley’s “ Silver King ” ad. makes the common
error of misquoting the first line of canto 1 of “In
Memoriam.” The keynote of the whole poem is struck in
the line “ I held it truth with him who sings,” &c. Every-
one quotes it “I hold,” &c. The “him who sings,” it
may be added, is either Goethe or St. Augustine, or both.
The Wild Cat Column.
It looks much as if the swagger pretence of
resuming work at the Broken Hill mines was only an en-
deavour to rig the London share-market, after all. It was
plain enough to anyone except those who wouldn’t see it,
that the demonstration of recommencing work on Thurs-
day last was a fizzle, and that no operations on a scale
which would provide dividends enough to purchase a
dinner of cat’s-meat had been resumed. But, then, the
daily press was nobbled before-hand, and trumpeted the
return of a handful of shift-bosses and the firing up of a
12-horse-power engine for electric lighting, as if the mines
were all in full work. And the lie was cabled to England
in all its swelled splendour, and then the wretched Eng-
lishmen began to buy shares on the boom, and somebody
here got out from under, and the name of Australia will
stink worse than 50 bogus banks when the victims got to
know the game that has been played on them.

A S.M. Herald writer advises the Broken
Hill miners to go to work “ trusting to the public to see
that they receive fair remuneration.” Now', it is the

vided by the Arbitration Bill.

Greta (N.S.W.) Colliery Co. has introduced
labour-saving coal-cutting machinery, which enables one
man to do two men’s work at one man’s pay, the
latter being fixed at 10s. a day, sixteen skips of
coal to be sent up early. The men offer to accept this,
provided the management finds powder and fuse. As the
machines represent a saving of Is. 9,1. per ton—the
difference between Is. lid. and 3s. Bd. per ton, or a
reduction in cost of nearly IS per cent.—the management
would still have the best of the new bargain.

The proposed Queensland Miniug-on-Private-

be advantageously worked on “ lone hands.”

Carruthers, M.P. (N.S.W.), said last week, and
Sydney Daily Tklkgrapii had the gall to print it: “ The
very newspaper articles which were puffing up Protection

Protection than they had under Freetrade.” Impudence
can scarcely go farther. The Freetrade D.T. joined, if it
did not lead, a Sydney combination of newspaper-pro-
prietors in an attack upon the wages of compositors,
pleading depressed times. Hardly had the reduction been
made than the D.T. declared a 15 per cent, dividend 1

Dear Bulletin, —Apropos your first leader of
20th Aug. What paper is there w hich dares to demand,
in the interests of an insuring public, the same scrutiny
into life-assurance companies’ balance-sheets as is now
taking place with regard to those of land companies? If
the loading of assets' with unjustifiable increases in value
at a time of depression, and paying large dividends out
of deposits, is criminal on the part of a land company, it
is absolutely hellish to do so in a life insurance co., and
pay dividends on t of the premiums of thrifty ignoramuses;
vet the matter receives no comment, although it is the
talk of the town. Why ?-Old Hiram.

Since the appointment of the late N.S.W.
Parliamentary Draughtsman to the Land Court Presi-
dentship, two comparatively unknown men have been
appointed to draft Acts and watch their course through
committee. As showing the necessity of having compe-
tent men to do this work, recently-discovered anomalies
in the N.S.W. Friendly Societies’ Act are worth noticing.
Some of the building societies registered thereunder have
carried on business for years, under the blissful delusion
that the liability of their members was limited to the
amount of their shares. And now they are taking steps
to bring themselves under the Companies’ Act, with
limited liability. Hence the remarks made by Judge
Wilkinson at the annual meeting of that well-managed
institution, the N.S.W. Civil Service Building Society.

It is alleged in evidence that a certain recently
“broken” Sydney company used to charge interest on
many of its dead overdrafts at the rate of from 15 to 30 per
cent The interest wasn’t paid, as a igile, neither was the
overdraft hut even when they were both hopeless there
was comfort in sticking on the percentage. The case
seems very much like that of Walter Besant’s money-
o-rubbino- sailor, Stephen Cobbledick, who kept a book in
which he charged his penniless niece £2 a week for board
and lodging from her infancy, and used to present that
unhappy orphan at intervals with a bill for £lBOO or
thereabouts and urge an immediate settlement. And
when the old man got in a worse temper than usual he
would stick on compound interest till the wretched girl
almost wanted to be dead.

Almost daily the public are being told that the
formation of the Newcastle Coal Trust “ is progressing
satisfactorily.” The true position of tire alleged Trust is
p,is—a lot of small collieries who, without a combination
of this sort see their own collapse looming ahead, are
doin' 1- their utmost to get the big collieries to join. These
big collieries, like Wallsend, A.A. Co., Lambton, and two
or three others, have a full appreciation of their own
strength as well as of the others' weakness, and stand off.
Without them the Trust would be of precious little use,
and therefore it is not likely to eventuate.

Contrast in gold-mining. Of a mine at Tuena
(N.S.W.)it is reported : “Five tons of stone returned 28
ozs. of gold, or over five oz. per ton, and the tailings
assayed over 2 oz. per ton. The crushing proves this
mine to be a most valuable property.” Queensland:
“The manager of the True Blue, at Croydon, reports that
he has lifted several hundred ozs. from the plates, but
intends running through 1200 tons before cleaning up.”
# * •*
If newspaper-puffing would enrich mines, then
there would be two dividend-paying wonders at Dal-
morton, N.S.W., viz.—Mount Fool and Mount Pool
Marvel. Some twelve months ago these claims had one or
two small crushings of wonderfully rich ore. Short
shoots of good stone are a feature of the Halmorton
district; while the mints furnish employment for many
men, they never seem to return anything to shareholders.
# * *
After all the newspaper-puffing given to the
Mt. Poole Marvel, a crushing of 30 tons has, we see,
returned one oz. to the ton.

A big N.Q. mining syndicate provides in its
articles of association:—Any person who has become
entitled to a share by any other way than by transfer
may, instead of being registered himself, elect to have
some person, to be nominated by him, registered as the
holder of such share.” This should be convenient tor

desire to have fingers in syndicate-pies without their con-
stituents knowing anything about it.

A yield of 05ozs. gold is reported from Rock-

shareholders in this concern were over-high. Of course
the gold is “being lost’’—another familiar N.S.W
wheeze.

A Sunday paper has had a wonderful record as
a “ mining tipster.” In turn it has urged its readers to
buy Bonanza Cottsols, Sunny Corner, Mount Galena, Pain-
hulas, Mount Stewarts, and other well-known stocks with
great assurance and persistency. In nearly every inst ance
ih'j shares have fallen from pounds to shillings, shillings
to pence, and pence to nothing. Such luck is really piti-
able. Silent as the grave concerning its previous predic-
tions, it now wanls'to boom Bendigo stocks, which Heaven
help, when such a Jonah comes to their aid.

Old George Lansell is again getting the lion’s
share of the Bendigo dividends. It was the same twenty
years ago. Lansell limited his speculations to Bendigo
till the occurrence of the silver-boom, and returned to
Australia from England when it was at its maddening
pitch. He plunged into Barrier properties, and dropped
out a sadder and wiser man when he had parted with
some £50,000. He says he lias had enough of silver.
Lansell is probably the gamest and most enterprising big
gold-mining spectator in the world : he stands to his guns
with a fixed determination to make more money or lose
all he has acquired in mining. Had things not taken a
turn in Bendigo, he would probably have gone under
altogether— his losses during the last seven years might
be reckoned by hundreds of thousands. At present
he is getting it back at the rate of thousands a week.
He is now offering £5OO reward to anyone who will profit-
ably treat 100,000 tons of Bendigo tailings. Taken all
round, there is little gold left in Bendigo tailings, and
the process which can work them at a profit will n'»ke a
fortune for its inventor elsewhere,

The syndicate who built that excellent and well-
situated arcade, the Sydney Strand, are trying to float
the concern into a company, with a capital of £125,000.
The properly is all leasehold, hut we notice that the
amount of the ground-rent is not stated in the prospectus.
The prospects of the Strand may be very good, but The
Bulletin, which knows something about city building-
leases, doesn’t, as a rule, hanker after investments in
that line. And, by the way, are the Strand tenants all
satisfied with the' rents as set down in the company’s

Matthew Davies was interviewed in London
about the lamented Mercantile Bank, and cheerfully ex-
plained his own entire freedom from all moral responsi-
bility : “ I was nominally on the board of the bank as well
as on that of several other institutions. I was asked not lo
withdraw my name from them because I was told it would
injure them ; but, as a matter of fact, since I took an
active interest in polities my connection with these
societies and companies has been more nominal than
formerly. I sat upon the boards, but 1 was not acquainted
with many of the transactions. You know very well that
the majority of these transactions are carried out by the
managing-directors.” Which practically amounts to
this; “I was paid to steer the ship. I kept the billet to
the last and drew the salary regularly, but latterly I was
asleep on the bridge all the time, so when the smash
came I really wasn’t responsible.” This reads welfc but
The Bulletin has known a man to get into serious trouble
before now for being asleep on the bridge.

Some more of the subtle mirthfulness of the
N.S. Wales mining industry. The Great Oohar Copper
Mine has, we believe, been shut down since August 1881).
The co. closed up with something over £4OOO in hand, and
carefully stowed away this amount to resume work with
when better times come. Lately, the shareholders have
found that instead of gathering interest the balance is fast
vanishing away, and upon enquiry it is explained that the
directors piopose to absorb £1875 for directors’ fees, Or
something like £5OO a year for sitting down and waiting
for copper to rise. At least it is hard to see what else, so
long as the mine is shut down, there is for a director to
do." At this rate, the shareholders should have calls made
on them presently.

he did wrong, was “compensated by having a
rope put round his neck.” Mrs. Lee forgets that
Deakin defended the party in question, and that
the poor pub.-keepers may be “instinctive
criminals” who deserve pity instead of vengeance.
“ Tiger ” Inglis always boasts that he’ s
Scotch. “ I was Bst. 41b. when I camo to this
country,” said he, the other day, slapping his
embonpoint by way of emphasis ; “ now I’m over
10st., and all owing to good Australian beef and
climate.” How little of him is Scotch, after all!
Hindustanee is Queen Victoria’s latest
accomplishment, and the Court Circular wants
to persuade us she held a conversation with the
Gaekwar of Baroda and (one of the) Mrs. Gaekwar
at Windsor lately. The Gaekwar, of course,
imderconstuinbled it all, and was delighted at the
Chocktaw.
A story of Deeming, rather late in the
day, but quite characteristic, and instanced by the
Melbourne police in their plea to be allowed to
nickel-plate their handcuffs ; “ As soon as Cawsey
clapped his bright nickel handcuffs on the prisoner,
Deeming exclaimed, ‘Ah! these are pretty. The
pair I wore coming down from Yilgarn weren’t fit
to be seen ! ’ ”
One of the papers has published a long
article about “ fascinating murderesses,” but the
ones dealt with are all English. No mention is
made of the late Louisa Collins, the Sydney
husband-poisoner, who, ere she could be con victed,
brought about the disagreement of two juries by,
in each case, fixing at least one juryman with her
glittering eye.
“ Prayer-meetings at Newcastle (Eng.) to
beseech aid for the candidature of Mr. Morley.”
Fancy asking God to approve of Morley, the Agnos-
tic, who writes “God ” with a small “g ! ” But
these prayer-meetings were bound to fail, anyhow.
All the bishops and orthodox clergy are against

They say that the Queen jumped on her
Crown, and refused to be comforted, when her
son-in-law Lome was rejected at the Central
Bradford election by a large majority. The
unhappy Marquis is always bringing ignominy
upon the Royal Family, and the Queen regards
him as a danger to the Constitution. Some years
ago, when they put him on horseback amongst a
procession of kings and princes, he disgraced his
relatives by falling off.
Mrs. Slight, a very old identity, has died
at Rangitikei (M.L.) after suffering for more than
half a century from hope deferred. She was the
sole heiress to a large fortune which the British
Court of Chancery consistently declined to part
with. The lady’s great-grandfather died last
century, leaving his fortune to his son, who was
understood to be somewhere on the Continent.
The son was never again heard of, and until his
death is proved the Court won’t shell out. If he
were alive he would now be about 130 years of
age, but even if he would be 1100 years old the
Court wants documentary evidence ere it recog-
nises his decease. Two generations of Slights
have waited patiently for the lost coin, and a
third one is now waiting.
There is a man up North who cut a tir
weathercock to look like Sam Griffith, and fixed
it on his chimney. On changeable days, when the
wind did not know which way to blow, he would
shake his fist at it and say ; “ Torn, you wretch
turn 1 you can’t turn like he does.” The other day
a gale blew the weathercock down ; but the owner
would not put it up again. lie says it is a good
omen.
James Gordon, S.M., new Adelaide police-
magistrate, is a brother of J. H. Gordon, Minister
of Education in (he Ministry which appointed
him. “Jack ” Nicholson, the new Port Adelaida
magistrate, familiarly known in Adelaide as “Old
Nick,” claims Playford, leader of the Opposition
as his brother-in-law. In each case the claims of
ill-paid and long-service country magistrates were
disregarded.
The new British Secretary of State for the
Colonies, the Marquis of Ripon, belonged—he
was then a lord—to the Society of Christian
Socialists founded years ago by Charles Kingsley
Thomas Hughes (author of “Tom Brown’s School-
days”) Maurice, and, we think, Clough, thepoet.
It was probably owing to his Socialism that
Ripon’s Indian Yiceroy-ship gained him such
popularity with the natives and so large a portion
of dislike from the livery, peppery officialdom that
lives by suction in that appanage of the Crown.
“Old” George Thornton’s friends, writes
our London correspondent by last mail, will be
pleased to hear that he has recovered from the
effects of the painful operation he lately under-
went, and is now fast regaining his old healthy
looks. He leaves London on Tuesday next, and
has sent liberal donations to the hospitals by way
of thanks-offering. An ancient crony of Thorn-
ton’s, once a well-known man in Sydney, but now,
I suppose, almost forgotten, is still to the fore-
Charlie Newton, who of yore was the head and
front of everything in the shape of sport in
Sydney. He bears his years well, for he is no
chicken. Talking of George Thornton reminds
me that he was once upon a time quite a per-
former in the pigskin, and rode several races at
the Drapers’ meeting at Homebush, which, about
35 years ago, was one of the most notable N.S.W.
reunions.
Some time ago a certain member of London
Savage Club, noted for his economy of the truth
was telling some astounding yarn and vouching
for its absolute accuracy. Old Odell listened
awhile in amazement, and then said to the waiter:
“Go to the library, please, and bring me a Bible.”
The waiter departed and duly returned with the
sacred volume. Odell handed it to Christie
Murray, asking him (as he could not see very well)
to turn to the Acts of the Apostles, naming chap-
ter and verse. This proved to be the story of
Ananias and Sapphira. “Read on,” said he.
Christie did so until he came to the words “ And
Ananias went forth.” “Stop there,” said Odell ;
“now, why did Ananias go ‘forth?’” Nobody
could answer. “He went fourth,” said Odell,
“because , and —— , and (naming
three well-known club liars who were present)
went first, second, and third.”
Mesfcon tells this yam himself to illustrate
the all-pervading character of fame:—“l was
walking down Queen-street not long ago when a
man stopped me. I had never seen him in my
life before. He said: ‘Excuse me, sir, but are
you Mr. Meston?’ I admitted that I was. ‘Yes,’
he said ; ‘ but, pardon me, sir, I mean are you Mr.
Meston, the great explorer?’ ‘Well—yes, 1 sup-
pose so,’ I said. Then he said : ‘ I want you to
do me a great favour, Mr. Meston.’ ‘What is
it ?’ I asked him. ‘ltis a very great favour, Mr.
Meston,’ he said - ‘I wish —that is, I would like—
if you—if you would condescend to shake hands
with me.’ ‘Certainly, my man,’ I said, and
shook. He wrung my hand with effusion and
said : ‘Thank you, sir ; thank you, Mr. Meston.
Now I shall go home and tell my wife and family
that I have shaken hands with Mr. Meston, the
great explorer.’ Now, wasn’t that curious?”
adds Meston, looking round—“never saw the man
in my life before.”

Dear Bulletin, —Under “Plain English,”

A Labour agitator, writes a correspondent,
visited the Percy River, Q., the other day and
wanted to know where he was going to speak. A
waggon was pointed out to him alongside a
crushing mill ; but it would be impossible, ho
said, to make himself heard. “ Oh, we'll stop the
mill while the meeting’s on,” said the boss. “My
men want to hear yon, and so do I.” How sweet
is harmony between Labour and Capital! Just
fancy the Southern boss stopping his mill to let
the boys bear an agitator !
It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Co.’s “Cascade,’
80 and 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is
just the place ; it is certainly the largest and best-
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there, so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*

For the first time in all its life, the Argus
quotes Reynolds. The latter paper has been
galloping over Gladstone.
The O’Sullivan, M.P. (N.S.W.), pro-
phesies that the Dibbs-Barton Government will
fall not on a fiscal but on a labour issue.
Morley’s majority for the bye-election at
Newcastle was substantial. Nevertheless, he got
what the Labour-party intended him to get—a
warning.
Pastoralists’ Review repeats ad nauseam
that “ capital has been frightened out of the
country.” Why, the banks are just gorged with
idle money.
Ex-Speaker Groom (Q.) belongs to the
wily, far-seeing order of politicians. He saw all
that Kanakilgriff jobbery looming up a good while
a o- 0 —and his health failed him.
T. Rose, M.P. (N.S.W.): “I believe
party Government should be abolished.” The
question of elective executives looms larger every
day on the horizon of practical politics.
So “ Sir George Grey’s Bill to make
Governors elective is calculated to frighten British
investors.” All right; let us have Australia
governed by a parliament of British investors.
The Griftihvraith Ministry, whose gospel
has been the reduction of wages, has cunningly
refrained from reducing its own salaries.
Private members have been cut down one-half.
Parkes thinks Copeland the most capable

because Parkes hears it rumored that Copeland
doesn’t work uncrcakingly with all his colleagues.
MTlwraith : “ I stand up here a free and

Why doesn’t M‘llwraith resign now ?
After what has been said of him and certain of
his business associates by the Chief Justice of
Queensland, it is indecent of him to hold office a

At the recent Labour Conference in

“Kokum ” Epps, for the National Ass., is
flooding the N.S.W. country press with essays on
Local Self-Government. But the trouble with
“ Kokum ” and Co. isn’t “ self-government.” They

Parkes considers politician-lawyer B. R.
Wise “ a man above the ordinary,” and says time
will cure his superfluity of irritability. So ! but
it will take eternity to cure the obviousness of
Wise’s selfishness and insincerity.
One Moses Alexander figures in last week’s
Melbourne obituary—not the celebrated one who
shone in the C. E. Jones case, of long ago, yet the
mere name brings all to mind. This was the
affair that forced on payment of members.
The endeavour of the capitalistic press is
always to prove the unionists to be controlled by
terrorism. “There are spies in the town,” says
the Argus, of Broken Hill, “ and if a man speaks
a word, he runs the risk of having his house burnt
down.”
G. D. Carter, M.L.A. (Vic.): “The wall

John White, aged over 70, has been sent

Bhiels has publicly stated that according

By refusing to repeal the Superannuation
Clause of the Queensland C.S. Act (after giving
two distinct and definite promises to that effect)
Griffith has put one more nail in his political
coffin. The clause referred to presses harshly on
the rank and file, who will have their revenge at
the general election.
Stirling, M.L.C., who pretends to be an
opponent of payment of members, has just
accepted the post of Chairman of Committees in
tl.o S.A. Council at £4OO a year. The Council
sits for five months in the year, two days a week,
and about three hours a day, while it is only in
Committee about a third of that time. His re-
muneration, therefore, is at the rate of about £lO
an hour.
Cabled that the U.S. M‘Kinley tariff is
directly responsible for the failure (in England) of
the big English firm of Sir Titus Salt, Bart., and
tvtot-’- Wors^e . an( l alpaca spinners i.c. , the
MTvinley tariff enables America to manufacture
its own alpaca and worsted goods on its soil. The
foreign manufacturer and the Yankee importer
go sorrowing, but the Yankee workman gets
regular wages.
Labouchere is excluded from Gladstone’s
Ministry because Queen Victoria and Co., whom
he has so long and so caustically and beneficially
criticised, naturally don’t like him. So you see
that Her Gracious, whose feelings have to be con-
sidered first and foremost, is not the expensive
dummy the apologists for the throne represent
her to be. Another argument for the Republic.
Chief Secretary Cockburn (S.A.), a metnber
of that class of politicians who do more from fear
of their enemies than from love of their friends, is
losing the confidence of the Democratic party be-
cause of his over-solicitude concerning the feelings
of the plutocrats and the conservative press. He
is a member of the Adelaide Club, and is on the
visiting-lists of all “the best people.” When
Nature stuffed his heart with vague socialistic
yearnings she forgot to give him a decent back-
bone.

That “Freedom of Contract,’
which boocotted the shearers and scat-
tered them broadcast throughout Queens-
land, did good work for the Labour
movement. Wherever a man goes now,
even in the most out-of-the-way places,
he will find a proscribed shearer with
a crowd iiim, who are being
educated in the principles of the New
Unionism. These shearers and labourers
are earnest apostles ; it would have
paid the squatters better not to have
dispersed them.
Cardinal Moran ;
“ The cry is sometimes
raised, ‘Not men, but
measures.’ Well, I am
sure there is not a pick-
pocket but woiil d

Right. The workers
want men to represent
them —men oftheirown
class, of their own
kidney, of their own
hopes, of their own
fears, of their own sym-
pathies. And, whisper,
Cardinal dear, for the
forum—“ Not priests,
but politicians; not
preachers,but workers. ”
A Bill is before

got so far as this yet.
He cheerfully gaols the

The present Maori-
land Parliament is the
biggest, measured by the average length of its
members, which has ever sat in Wellington. It
contains twelve men each over six feet high, while
the longest previous Parliament only contained
nine. Also, it is about the brainiest Legislature in
Australasia, despite the theory that long men are
devoid of intelligence. Probably it was the envious
short men who started this theory. The malignity
of a very short man who is baulked of a Govern-
ment billet is a horrible tiling.
Owing to a disagreement between some
little niggers belonging to Dutch New Guinea
and a few small aborigines in the British section
of the same island, Sir William Macgregor lias
asked Governor Norman to ask the British
Government to ask the Queen of the Netherlands
to suppress the lawlessness prevailing at the
Dutch end of the colony. Then the matter will
be referred, no doubt, to the Governor of Dutch
New Guinea, and he will ask his sovereign to ask
the British Government to ask Governor Norman
to tell Macgregor that the matter shall bo
attended to.
N. S. Wales contains 195,882,150 acres ;
45,731,9GI acres, or 23 per cent., are alienated, or
in process of being alienated ; 132,425,324 acres
or 07 per cent., are leased ; 17,724,502 acres, or
about 10 per cent., are held by the State in rail-
ways, roads, reserves, &o. Of the 45,731,904 acres
alienated, 21,283,393 acres, or nearly 47 per cent.,
were sold in fee simple ; 2,084,112 acres, or about
5 per cent., by deferred payments ; 3,123,094 acres,
or about 7 per cent., wore free grants ; the balance,
about 42 per cent., is still “ going, going.” Of the
132,425,024 acres of leased lands, the pastoralists
have 58,410,794 acres, or about 44 per cent.; occu-
pation licenses, 40,038,749 acres, or nearly 38 per
cent.; conditional leases, 11,234,131 acres ; home-
stead licenses, 8,005,035 acres.
Under the new cast-iron Standing Orders
of Queensland (intended to choke the Labour-
party), a member adjudged guilty of contempt
may lie lined up to ,£5OO, and kept under arrest,
or in confinement, until the fine is paid, or until
end of the session. He has to give the
Sepjeant-at-Arms £lO for arresting him, pay that
official ss. per mile for conveying him to his parti-
cular “jug,” and also pay £2 per day in fees for
every day he is kept under arrest. If, for in-
stance, a Labour-member were fined £5OO at the
commencement of a session, he couldn’t possibly
pay it, and by the end of the session—say, about
150 days—he would owe £BOO, besides “ mileage
fees,” and could probably be made insolvent, or
otherwise forced out of Parliament.
Governor Jersey (N.S.W.); “It does not
detract from a Governor’s position that he holds
the office of Grand Master of Freemasons in New
South Wales.” If that be so, if it doesn’t detract
from a Governor’s position that he is head of a
(pretendedly or otherwise) secret society, then
nothing can detract from a Governor’s position.
It doesn’t detract from a Governor’s position to
be Worthy Grand Mongrel of the Vermilion
Order of Yellow Pups. It doesn’t ditto to be
Worthy Chief Washtowel of the Loyal Order of
Grovelling Huckabacks. It doesn’t likeioise to be
Boss Proboscis of the Postdiluvian Guild of the
Illuminated Oriflamme. It doesn’t, in fact,
matter a Chioago-Dibbser whether an Imported
Figurehead is the Butt-end of the Goat, or the
Goat-end of the Butt—or anything—or nothing.

A puzzled West Queensland Acting-C.P.S.,
a police-sergeant, asked to issue a summons
against a drover for not travelling his stock the
regulation day’s distance, wired to Brisbane to the
Chief Inspector for information. The reply came
(unpunctuated, of course); “Act relating to
travelling stock see. 55 cattle 6 miles sec. 58 sheep
fi miles.” “ Ye-e-s, ’ remarked the C.P.S., scratch-
ing his skull-thatch, “ye-e-s, that’s all right, but
he gives the number of (scarlet) stock that have to

The disadvantages attached to the country-
newspaper habit of issuing cheap-and-nasty sup-
plements (supplied wholesale by city printing firms
at Chinese rates), consisting mainly of pirated
matter and literature paid for at “ sweaters’ ”
prices, has been strikingly illustrated in the case
of a Bathurst (N.S.W.) journal, some of whose
rivals have been quoting from one of its “supple-
ments,” an article diametrically opposed to those
political and party views which it has been all
along sledge-hammering into its constituents.
Dear Bulletin,— The existing Charter®
Towers papers are bound to the chariot-wheels of a
capitalistic clique. Their reports of the Day
Dawn trouble arc fair samples of their onesided-
ness. By the way, touching that same, the
working miners were badly exasperated at the
refusal of the P.M. to grant Vosper bail, and on
the Thursday and Friday nights they formed
processions of over 1000 strong, marched up to the
lock-up and cheered for “ prisoner ” Vosper. Then
they hooted the local press and mining-manager
Rollston. The police-sergeant wired to Towns-
ville for additional assistance, and six constables
were sent along, armed with revolvers, &e., but
had the miners been inclined to be rough—well !
A movement is afoot to start a workers’ daily
paper on the Towers. About .£5OO is already pro-
mised. and more than half of that has "been
actually paid in. Numbers of men are daily
joining the Associated Workers’ Union. Wo will
yet return Vosper to Parliament.—Yours, Miner,
Charters Towers, 30. July, ’92.
Newspaper accounts are to hand of the

The dead man’s liver was divided between the

A condemned man’s liver thus taken is reckoned a

A man who has travelled all over Queens-
land during the last two years gives this as his
downright opinion:—“Don’t you make any
mistake about Bananaland, when you hear it’s
broke. Present insolvency—and a cold outlook
for at least three years—rests like a heavy fog
upon Brisbane, but upon Brisbane only. All the
rest of Queensland is commercially prosperous.
And after three years more of Purgatory, there
will be a boom in Brisbane too.”
A settler on a desolate sand-patch in a
dismal, ghost-strewn, spectre-haunted region near
the Great Australian Bight claims to own
Leichardt’s long-lost mule which is flourishing to
this day. He is alleged to have been found at
some indefinite place in the far interior with an
aboriginal legend attached to him to the effect
that he was one of a party which travelled into
the interior some (150 odd moons ago. Therefore,
the animal is understood to be GO years old, on a
rough estimate, which rather corroborates the
story than otherwise, for heaven and earth may
pass away but the mule dieth not, but goeth on
for ever; and when the end of the world comes,
the chances are. that the last man will be a mule,
and it is quite as likely to be Leichardt’s mule as
any other.
In the early days of Adelaide, just after
the arrival of a shipload of Prussian political
exiles, an aboriginal entered a draper’s shop in
the city and said ; “ You gib it tschirt; all same
white man’s money,” and he produced three florins
and a sixpence. Having chosen the shirt ho
wanted, Jacky suddenly proceeded to divest him-
self of the one lie had worn for the previous
year, and to don the new garment. The opera-
tion was watched with much awe, especially by
the shop-girls and their lady customers. “ Now
you gib it paper,” said Jacky. “ What for ?” was
the salesman’s query. “Wrap up long a tschirt,”
was the reply. “Oh,” said the draper, “you
don’t want that dirt}', greasy thing. Leave it
here and I’ll burn it.” The careful nigger caught
hold of the garment, and answered—“My word,
no fear; you gib it paper. Me gib um" tschirt
poor plurry German.”
Thus a correspondent :
Dear Bulletin, —Does any Lodging-House Act obtain
in Sydney? lam poor, but up to date of cleanly habits,
and I, the other night, rented a shilling bed, right in the
centre of the city. I was shown up two flights of stairs
into a room with a sloping ceiling, the lowest part of
which was about four-feet high. In this attic were four
beds, of three of which J was allowed 1113' choice. How-
ever, as it turned out, I had all the room to myself. But
had three other customers turned up, and supposing that
(like myself) Ihey all smoked, what an atmosphere we
should have breathed! There were one wash-stand,
one basin, no jug at all, no water (I suppose shilling-
dossers in the city never wash on these cold mornings),
and one jack-towel (utterly useless under the circum-
stances). Many months ago, I slept one night at a
Paddington establishment that accommodates men by
the dozen, and when I asked to be shown to the bath-
room, I was stared at as a curiosity. A crowd came to
gape at the man who expected to find a bathroom in such
a place. If there is no Lodging-House Act in force in
Sydney, I trust some lion, member will introduce a Bill
into Parliament to reform lodging-houses.— Countryman.
When Doctors Disagree!
Professional etiquette almost always prevents
one doctor finding fault with another’s treatment,
no matter how erroneous he may consider it, but a
case where they quite differed occurred the other
day in the city of Melbourne. A poor, nervous
patient, suffering from the follies of early life,
called upon a medical man, who subjected him to
a thorough examination and then, putting on his
most sympathetic and serious look, exclaimed,
“My poor man, you are in a terrible and
dangerous condition, your spinal cord is only
hanging by two threads, and it will cost one
hundred and fifty guineas to cure you.” This
announcement of course frightened the patient out
of a year’s life, and he considered he had better
have another opinion if the case was so serious,
and went to another doetor, who also examined
him carefully and pronounced “Dr.' is a
fool, for your spinal cord is only hang-
ing by one thread and it will cost three hundred
guineas to cure you.” And he got it. So much
for frightening nervous subjects, three hundred
guineas for a few bottles of physic not half so good
or reliable as Clements Tonic. This medicine
will cure the worst case of nervous debility when
all the quacks have failed to “ restore manhood
a course always results with success, but it must
not be expected that one bottle will give any man
a new lease of life. If your case is worth treating
or your life valuable to you, treat the case
thoroughly and faithfully and you will meet’with
the same success as others do. H. H. Bestman,
Esq., Klein-stieet, Toowoomba, Q., writes :
“Knowing that you are always pleased to hear of
the cures effected by your remedy, I am glad to
state that I have derived great results by its use.
Some years ago 1 caught a severe cold which
induced dyspepsia, severe pains all over my body,
the joints being swollen, my appetite impaired and
a great swelling under my right arm, all finally
ending in St. Vitus’ dance, my body being con-
tinually ‘on the shake.’ 1 consulted a physician ;
he prescribed medicines, hot baths and rubbing
the body with Rhus. Tox, and so on; but his
treatment did me no good. He then had recourse
to Clements Tonic and said I must take a course
of that medicine. I did so, and so recovered my
appetite, and my strength began to improve
generally, and in eight months the shakes were
entirely stopped, and now I am entirely cured,
solely by the use of Clements Tunic." Patients
must be on their guard against imitations ; insist
on having what you call for, “Clements Tonic.”
Refuse all where tiie package has been tampered

THE SUPPRESSION OF
LARRIKINISM.
A number of regulations have been drafted
by the Minister of Justice in connection with
Ins bill for the supression of -disorderly cOn.
duct. He is by na means prepared to make
residence in gaol a pleasant change for
characters of the larrikin type, and his re.
gulations are consequently as vigorous as
present day views of punishment will per*,
mit. While the health of tho prisoner ia
gaol for brutal assaults and conduct generally
"associated with “pushes” will not be
neglected,-the Minister proposes to make big
stay in prison as little to be regarded with
complacency as it is .possible to do. The
principal hardship will be In the restricted
diet, which is literally In certain cases to
consist of bread and water, and nothing else.
In every sentence under the bill for a period
under 10 days this frugal diet is to be pro-
vided ; when the sentence is for a longer
period the diet drill be mainly bread and
water, but other lood is to be allowed
under the orders should it be deemed
necessary for the preservatidaof health. The
sleeping accommodation is also not to be too
luxurious. What is known as the "plank”
bed is to be insisted on'for the whole terra of
imprisonment. "

A lady, born and educated in Australia,
was lately travelling on a mail-steamer in Japanese
waters, and entered into a protracted conversation
with the stewardess, a German-American. “ I
can’t for the life of me make out,” said the latter,
“what country you come from. You aren’t a
’Murkan, and I’m sure you’re not English, because
you don’t speak good English.” “What do you
mean ?” asked the lady—“ do you mean that you
never have heard me say anything like ‘Steyoo-
ahdess, bring me a glass of wahtah, please ! ’ ”
“Waal, yes,” said the stewardess, “ I guess that’s
what I did mean ” “ And which English do you
prefer—the ‘good English’ or my English?”
“ Waal, mum,” returned the other, “ I guess 1 like
your English because I can understand it.”

If Australia isn’t “Greater Britain,” it is
at least “Greater London.” Even tolerably well-
educated Australians, in pronouncing words con-
taining the long-a vowel, fall into a branch of
Cockney twang, as, for instance, pronouncing
“lady” as though it were spelt “lydy.” At a
certain Sydney down-the-harbour picnic most of
the revellers went ashore near a skating-rink. One
girl, being asked why she lingered aboard the
steamer, explained : “ I don’t skite.” Later, when
refreshments were being served, someone asked :
“ What’s Nelly doing ?” “ Oh, she’s looking after
the plttes (plates).” Again : “Kite, will you have
some rtsons?” Kate : “No, thanks ; I’ve got some
gripes !” Then the chief mite choked himself with
Aike.

A meeting for the Promotion of Public
Morality was held in Melbourne last week, and if
any unregenerate cynic wandered into the gather-
ing by accident, he probably took a back seat and
smiled vigorously. At the outset, the venerab’e
Dean stuck himself up, so to speak, with the
Scriptures, where lie “found that a man was
allowed to have more wives than one, while a
woman was only allowed to have one husband.”
After this the meeting seemed to find the Scrip-
tures impracticable, and left them severely alone.
Discussion drifted on to the necessity for protect-
ing infant life, without resorting to tho awful
immorality of a foundling hospital, but here again
were believers in the sacredness of the marriage-
tie set pondering over an unc:ngeuial fact. One
moralist mentioned that, “ with certain excep-
tions, the vast proportion of illegitimate children
were the healthiest children born.” The absurdity
of taking any measures, direct or indirect, to
further reduce tho physique of the rising genera-
tion was now quite apparent, so the meeting fell
back upon the eternal question of organisation,
and finally departed, with a sad conviction that
the present state of public morality was all owing
to the want of a paid secretary.

The bursting of the boom lias certainly
cleared the social atmosphere of N.S. Wales and
Victoria. The Pharisees who infested every
“ V.K.” public and private function, and postured
prominently on the dais ; the loudly-dressed snobs
whose vogue it was to welcome every more tban-
ordinary visitor “ in tho name of Australiaand
the greasy saints whose eyes were the whitest,
whose public graces were tho longest, whose
prayer-meeting groans were the awfnllest, and
whose coins dropped in the missionary-boxes like
stirrup-irons on a steel floor; these and a lot more
pinchbeck pretenders have scurried away to their
secret holes, and there is now a chance of occa-
sionally seeing and hearing a few healthy and
honest people move and talk.

The Bulletin finds no fault with Gover-
nor Ilopetoun for discussing the usefulness of
Clydesdale entires at an agricultural • show
luncheon, and in the presence of ladies. We
would like to hear somebody lecture on the breed-
ing of mankind at a baby-show. When women
once begin to understand that a healthy, intelli-
gent human sire does as much for the good of the
country as a well-selected stud-horte, the influence
of the gilded, rickety dude on posterity will grow
beautifully less.

Looked at from any point of view, the
alleged “Keely Cure” for drunkenness has a
fishy aspect. It is highly alcoholic, to start with.
It is a quack remedy whose virtues mostly consist
in the loudness and frequency and cheekiness of
the quacking. It is as greedy and shindykitish a
business and advertising spec, as any Rubemout’s
soap, or Horsetail’s hair-restorer, or crystalline
competition lotion, or universal pill, or Salvation
Army. It refuses to submit itself to unchallenge-
able tests by recognised medical authorities. Its
main strength is alleged to ,be its secrecy. It is
taken up and boomed by physicians who indi-
vidually, and apart from specious and cunning
advertising, are medical failures. Its other chief
allies are hollow-headed posturing parsons who
tove to mount on any emotional wave-crest.
When a Yankee leviathan advertiser like Keely
pals in on business-nm-philanthropic principles
with the Rev. Howling Yawper type of platform-
parson, the aroma of tho scheme is tew
mutch.

A well-dressed youth one recent morning
engaged rooms at a small hotel, paying cash in
advance. In the afternoon, he had retired to Ins
bedroom, when his door was stormed by some
fussy domestics who imperatively insisted that
“ the woman you've got in there” must be at once
thrust forth. In vain he avowed that the lady
was his wife ; the servants gave him no quarter.
So he sent for the hotel manager, who, for some
reason or other, opined that the youth was not
married at all, and that such goings-on, you know
—his shoulders, almost following his eyebrows to
tlie ceiling, finished the sentence. The cause of
all the rumpus shrieked to be taken away from tho
horrid place; then she fainted and finally had to bo
half carried off the premises. Since then the
lawyers have begun to take an interest in that
hotel manager and his amateur Gimlet Brigade.

A certain holy young man, who used to
evangelise the Chinese in an Australian city,
not long ago, met an attractive wanton there—a
Jewess, the mistress of a boss Chow. The wily
woman angled for that green young man, and
married him. That’s it. Alas for the emotional
youth who tries to reclaim the strange woman !

By the way, not long ago a philanthropic
Melbourne journalist went to a lot of trouble to
rescue a fallen sister, lie seemed to persuade the
female of the error of her ways, and she repented
with great gusto. But just as the zealous press-
man was beginning to hug the idea that all was
well with his protegee, she wandered back to
Little Bourke-street, complaining bitterly that he
had never once tried to hug her. She had expected
to be given fresh chances to repent, every now and
then.

We read in a fashion paper that at a
“blue-blood” wedding in Dublin, the other day,
the choir sang an amorous hymn, commencing—
It is difficult to imagine the Lord giving away an
Eve “ in a long train of rich white velvet ” to an
Adam who waits in a blue frock-coat and fawn-
coloured pants, also the thought of this bride
having recently arisen from the side of her sleep-
ing dude makes us blush.

The Sydney “ polaise ” are now compelled
by regulation to wear around their manly
peripheries, full-width razor-strops, with saucer-
sized buckles. The larrikin can now see the
glistening waist-dial of his enemy four streets off,
and his pocket-album may be reduced to the
dimensions of carrying only tho “futtoes” of the
plain-clothes oopman.
It is cruelly rumoured that tho Fosbery intends
to arm all the Sydney foorco with tho latest
squeezer in corsets. Bustles, unfortunately, are
out of fashion.
The Catholic Times (Wellington, M.L.)
gets up on its spiritual ear ;
After offering the perfectly magnilcont. sum of £lO for
a design for his Australian (not Australasian, it will he
observed ; Stead’s geography being weaker than his
blazing morality) edition of the Review of Reviews, Stead
has got his design, and is only paying £5 for it, owing to
some artistic “improvements” which he has himself
introduced. It looks like a £5 design. On the top
corners are portraits of Stead and Fitchett —the latter
being the Australian editor; between them is a large-
sized, five-pointed star from which proceed rays. There
are more rays thrown on Stead than on Fitchett. The
two editors are in the centre of life buoys, which may
possibly be horse-collars, and are tied together with some-
thing which may he (he feeler of an octopus or a second-
hand wooden comforter with a bullock’s heart in the
centre. Beneath Stead and Fitchett, who are perched in
space, looking down upon the north pole, are stars,
comets, clouds and things, the word ninepence, and two
swollen periwinkles, also a black badge hearing the
legend “ Review of Reviews.” Then there is something
round with “ Australia ” on it. This round thing, Which
is probably a football—in delicate compliment to Aus-
tralian tastes—is supported on one side by a rhinoceros in
ship’s slings all ready to be hoisted on board something,
and on the other tya mouse with rabbit’s ears, standing
on its hind legs. These structures rest upon thistles and
other garden produce, which, in their turn, repose on
a clean hook with a white swan swimming about it. The
design is perfectly unique and is everyway worthy of the
good sense and profound artistic taste of that modest
creature, W. T. Stead.

It must be pleasant to “go broke” in
Tasmania. At a recent meeting of creditors in a
local country town tlio insolvent had no assets.
This was bad, and the creditors of the poor

of them, to give him a fresh start.

A slab of the S.M. Herald’s “ dignified

A Launceston (Tas.) solicitor was “set

who sued for the price of a lady’s dress. The
defence was that the garment was ill-fitting—-in
fact, that a hiatus appeared between the skirt and
bodice that might suit a Hindoo, but not a ’Conta.
The magistrate, with the practical wisdom of a
Haroun-al-Raschid, directed the lady to put on
the dress. Attorney Clarke noted the ungainly
result, and asked the wearer if she had not
relaxed her stay-lace. Replied she promptly :
“Come and feel for yourself.” Poor Clarke col-
lapsed—really and truly men are ever so much
more modest than women. Verdict for defendant,

A Sydney “jolmnio ” lately asked a High-

In a fashionable Sydney restaurant appears
this notice : “ Anyone not receiving proper atten-
tion is requested to report to the manager.”
Another notice should be placed beside it, thus :
“Any waitress receiving improper attention is
requested to report to the manager.” Then the
girls and well-dressed cads would have an equal
show. When we abolish barmaids, let us also
abolish waitresses and coffee-palace chamber-
maids. Better, in fact, abolish women altogether.

A Sydney barber lately went mad. He’d
have a man half shaved, and then suddenly hold
the razor aloft, and fix his stony gaze upon the
ceiling. The wretch in tho chair would then
perceive that he was at the mercy of a crank.
Some men would spring out of the chair and
knock the lunatic endways and then dash out into
the street hatless and eoatless and with one cheek
covered with lather ; others would sit there petri-
fied for half-an-hour, with the perspiration trick-
ling down into their boots. The poor crank ia

A half-caste lady in Maoriland, who on
the Maori side can trace back her ancestors for
20 generations, is suing a local steamship company
for damages. She took a saloon passage from
Lyttelton to the Chatham Islands, and when she
got on board was blandly informed that she
would have to go steerage because the grocer’s
wife, and the butcher’s female, and the “missus”
of the land-grabber, and so on, refused to associate
with her by reason of her olive skin, and because
she wasn’t Hinglish. As she declined to go
steerage the captain returned her part of her
passage-money and put her ashore. It is a cheer-
ful thing to reflect that if the Christian’s dark-
skinned Asiatic Redeemer came back to earth now
the butcher’s wife would probably draw the
colour-line at Him also.
In N.S.W. Supreme Court recently a
newly-fledged barrister, son, too, of a remarkably
clever Judge, was endeavoring to cross-examine a
shrewd business man. Ho bad a heap of pass and
cash-books in front of him and was hopelessly
floundering amongst the figures when he received
some apparently great idea from the attendant
attorney and with austerity said: “Witness, did
you sell Mr. Hotelkeeper a consignment of
brandy?” “ Yes.” “ Did be pay yon ?” “Yes.”
“ Now be careful! where is the receipt he gave
you for the payment ?” Roars of laughter.

When an Australian male or female student
passes a “brilliant examination ’ at the Apothe-
caries’ Hall, London, why on earth should any
fuss be made about it in the press or elsewhere ?
The medical examinations at Melbourne and Syd-
ney Universities are infinitely tougher on the
average than the Scotch or English exams. As a
matter of fact, about half the students who leave
Australia to get qualifications abroad are afraid of
or have proved themselves unable to negotiate the
local scholastic fences.

Noticing Roydhouse and Taperell’s sketch
of the N.S. W. Labour party—good enough as far
as it goes— Sydney Mail remarks :
The book hears the imprint of a Scottish firm. _What
can he the matter with colonial printers that the printing
ami binding of such a hook should have been done out ot

The answer is simple: FrcclmdeJ But a more
pertinent enquiry would be : “ What is the matter

A SONG IN THE NIGHT.
By the river the winds are sighing
Strange music of things undying,
The bamboos rustle and rave the whole night long.
The plaint of the fair flowers growing
Is sad, for the reaping and sowing
Cease not, and the Voice of Night is a careful song.
The free of tho dark stream, flowing,
Is troubled by breezes, blowing
From never unto forever in endless throng;
And phantoms, wildly flying
Hither and thither, are crying
Hasten, oh Dawn ! for Night is the mother of wrong.

SHAHO.
AN UNORTHODOX WAIL.
Oh ! I want to go back to the city,
Away from this desolate place
With its acres of “ solitudes awesome ”
And the horror of “infinite space.”
I am tired ot “ the wail of the plover,”
l am sick of “ the magpie’s sweet song
I loathe “ the complaint of the curlew,”
I’ve heard it too oft and too long.
“ Long tramps thro’ the forests ” are failures,
“ Summer strolls by swift streams ” apt to pall;
I am weary of “fresh air and freedom,”
Since a surfeit I’ve had of them ail.
The sight of “ a drover” is deadly,
The “crack of his whip” drives me mad,
The low of wild cattle’s depressing,
And “ the bleat of the sheep” quite as had.
“ Misty mountains may tow’r in the distance,”
And soulful ones rave of their height;
1 wonder how far they’re from Sydney
If from them the city’s in sight.
The “ soil may he rich ” and the cattle
Exactly “ the thing ” in their breed ;
I wish they were mine and I’d sell them
And make for that city with speed.
A telegraph-wire and a sparrow
Furnish plenty of Nature for mo,
And a walk to save ’bus-fare sufficcth
To give me a relish for tea.
A sirloin on Sundays, or saddle
Of mutton’s enough of (heir kind
To prime me in “ good points in cattle ”
And such, once I’ve left these behind.
I yearn for the roar of street traffic.
For the howl of the newspaper-boy,
While the yell of the man with bananas
Is a dream of delirious joy.
The hell-birds may chime for the poets,
1 pine for the shriek of a tram ;
And “ the rustle of leaves in the autumn”
May be music—to me it’s all sham.
Brickfield Hill or, say, William-street (Upper)
Are “ mountains ” enough to please me,
And for “soil ” give me wood-blocks and pavements,
“ Rural streams ” the green hay near the Quay.
For oh ! there are hearts in the City !
There are souls! there are welcoming eyes!
And I long for a sight of my fellows,
For a word from the friends that I prize.

the “women” and the “democratic” set. The

called the “ Warrawee,” which means “ a resting-
place.” The “ladies” already have rooms in

scientiously answer in the negative the two
Queries—“ Are you a woman?” and “Are you
democratic ?” Thus is foreshadowed the splitting
into two big political factions of the women of
Melbourne.

A Dapto (N.S.W.) divorce co-respondent,
who seems to have badly mismanaged bis amours,
was cast in ,£250 damages in Sydney last week.
He was a victim to the old ruse of the absent
husband’s sudden return. He ran out of the house,
with the husband in full chase ; swam a creek;
hubby did ditto; tried to double back to the
house, but the other fellow got there first and
impounded his clothes. “ \Vhich I have them
yet,” he triumphantly informed the Court. Decree
nisi.

What may happen to a husband in N.S.W.
Seven years ago a couple (both under age) married,
and lived together for nine months, when the wife
skedaddled ; eight months later she returned to
her home and hub ; five months later still she again
left him and openly lived immorally; another five
months elapsed and she was taken back again.
This see-saw connection continued until —whoop
fur the sex ! she secured a maintenance order
against him'. Not being able to pay, be went to
gaol for a year. Yet again she got another main-
tenance order, and he went to gaol for twelve
months more. He emerged from prison in May
last, entered proceedings for divorce, and last
week got a rule nisi.

According to a smart London paper Tas-

of Donoughmore), to marry titled folks. They

Miss Ackermann, W.C.T.U. lecturess,

yl le converted from polyandry to monogamy. The
woman had three husbands, all brothers. One
day she enquired of Miss Ackermann which one

Miss Ackermann told her to decide for herself. A
week later the woman came and said she had
decided. “I enquired,” said Miss Ackermann,
“ which of the husbands she had chosen, and you
wiU be astonished when I tell you which one it
was. Ihe respective ages of the men were 21, 43,

was standing near the lady whom he had taken in to
dinner, and whom he had entertained delightfully. She,-
not knowing that he was near, remarked to the hostess,
“ IVhat a very agreeable man Mr. Hare is.” The hostess
heard her in a vague, indistinct sort of way, and, thinking
the praise was for her room and not for her company, she
replied: “Yes, and so warm and comfortable on a

FROM SHADOW LAND.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I’m alone with moods and fancies,
And the air is hot and dried,
But a ruddy sparkle dances
In the bottle at my side
As I pass a solemn stricture
On my faults and follies all,
And I gaze at Kendall’s picture
Smiling at me from the wall.
But be sets my thoughts astraying
From the matter I’d in hand,
From my self-inflicted flaying,
To the misty Shadowland,
Where the past is like the present
And there’s neither first nor last
But my journey wasn’t pleasant
Mid the phantoms of the past.
For I saw the wretched poets
Who had sung amid a throng
Of dull clowns that didn’t know its
Sons of sin from sons of Song
Till the grave had darkened o’er them
And they lay among the dead ;
Then the fools fell down before them,
Bringing laurels for the head.
Here’s a happy thought—l struck it
In the gloom of Shadowland—
Ere you kick this earthly bucket,
Here, my brother, is my hand,
If you care to lake a greeting
From a fool you never knew :
Here’s a tumbler to our meeting,

Paramo and the Medicos.
What the Press Says.
TYPOGRAPHICAL TESTIMONY.
THE EDITORS FOR ONCE AGREE.
(New Zealand Times, May 14, 1802.)
The British Medical Journal is very angry
with Lord Onslow. The particular cause of the
Journal’s wrath is that our late Governor has
absolutely dared to testify to the value of remedies
whose composition is not detailed in the British
Pharmacopoeia. The wrath is expressed as
follows ; —“ We see with regret Lord Onslow
shamelessly puffing quack secret remedies by an
advertised letter —as scandalous an abuse of
political position and as discreditable a folly as
lias been for a long time brought under notice.”
Poor Lord Onslow ! The dyspeptic diatribe
above quoted owes its existence, no doubt, to the
fact that Lord Onslow, having found virtue in
some of the Maori herbal remedies prepared by
Mother Aubert, actually had the courage to say
so in print. Why the British Medical Journal
should deem such testimony a high offence, and,
judging by the strength of the language it uses,
an almost criminal misdemeanour, I totally fail to
see, save that the average medical mind is fanatic-
ally opposed to any medical innovation which
does not proceed from recognised red-taped
sources.
’Twas ever thus with the medicos. Almost
every new advance made in medical science has
been bitterly attacked as “quackery” when it
appeared, every new thinker denounced as a mad-
man or worse, and every formula not hall-marked
by the Lancet and British Medical Journal as
a dangerous innovation. Personally, while not
having the pleasure of a personal acquaintance
with either Mother Aubert or Mr. Kempthorne, I
can sympathise with them and Lord Onslow
in seeing the Maori Remedies denounced as
“quack secret remedies.” Only one of those
same “quack remedies” do I know, and that
Karana to wit, which, as “ a real good thing ” for a
man with a liver, I would cordially recommend to
the editor of the B.M.J. He appears to need it
sadly, for the common and domestic and “ recog-
nised ” podophylin has evidently been of no
service to him, otherwise he would never have
penned so spiteful a paragraph. As, however,
the “Maori Remedies” —“quack and secret”
though they be—are reported to be selling like the
proverbial “hot cakes,” neither Mother Aubert
nor Mr. Kempthorne is likely to worry about the
wrath of the British Medical Journal. As for
Lord Onslow, he is at Home, and can fight his
own battle. —“ So*"'tator,” in the New Zealand
Mail.”
The Autumn and Winter Seasons-
As the days become shorter at this period of the
year, with the lesser appearance of the sun, so the
climate becomes more changeable and much colder.
Now is the time when everybody puts on more
clothes to sustain the warmth of the body, but
how few people escape the prevailing coughs and
colds of the autumn and winter seasons, notwith-
standing these precautions.
To all who have suffered from the dire effects of
INFLUENZA, it must be pointed out that they
are much more susceptible to affections of the
throat than when they were in their former good
health.
This has been emphatically proved, and to such
persons a warning is highly necessary.
Marupa
is the Remedy which should be on hand, and
sufferers will always find benefit from its use. No
proprietary medicine has a larger sale in New
Zealand than this now popular remedy, and of its
success there is no doubt, as the testimonials
received acknowledging this are very numerous.
Marupa
is a vegetable preparation, and cannot hurt the
smallest child, but its value in removing irritation
of the lungs and bronchial tubes is far and away
in excess of the price charged for it.
Why be in misery when a bottle of this excellent
combination of herbs will afford joyful relief?
A cold in the head is a very troublesome thing,
but
Marupa
can cure it. All sufferers from chest complaints
are advised to GIVE IT A TRIAL; satisfaction
is bound to result.

JpOPULAR WATCHES AT POPULAR
PRICES!
THE WATERBURY WATCHES
have established for themselves an enviable reputa-
tion as ACCURATE, RELIABLE, and UN-
EXPENSIVE TIMEKEEPERS, and for all
practical purposes are UNEQUALLED by any
other low-cost watch in the world.
READ THE OPINIONS OF THE PUBLIC.
Mr. JOHN J. HILLY, Berivvinia Downs,
Wanaaiing, writes, under date ‘loth July, ’92:—“l
have worn your ‘ J ’ series and ‘E ’ series Water-
bury Watches, and have found bolli kinds to be ex-
cellent timekeepers. After seven years’ trial of
these watches I can safely recommend them to
anyone in want of a really good watch.'’
Mr. EDWARD CARLTON, Peel River Co.'s
Gate, Duri, 11th July, ’92“ I have much
pleasure in giving you my opinion of the Water-
bary Watch. I have had two. The first fell to
the floor from a child’s hand after two years of
keening perfect time, carried every day on rough
mountain riding. The second one I have carried
four years, and have never had occasion to alter
it, it having always kept perfect time. For a
bushman, I am confident they cannot bo sur-
passed as timekeepers.”
Mr. FRANK W. MILLS, Abbey Green,
Singleton, 9th July, ’92 “ Without the slightest
hesitation I thoroughly recommend the Water-
bury as a good timekeeper. Mine has been tested
in various shearing sheds, &c., and against many
sorts, and yet never been beaten. I have had
this one nearly three years, hard riding daily, and
vet no difference.”
Mr. W. H. CLAYTON, Hillston, <Sth July,
’92;-—“I have received my Waterbury Watch,
‘L’ series, which has been repaired by you,
greatly to my satisfaction, and at such small cost.
This watch I have had for three years. It has
been an excellent timekeeper, and I would re
commend anyone wanting an inexpensive watch
to purchase from your company. This is the
first time watch has been repaired.”

“Dawson”; Intentions good, but the metre
.Inin' like a liroken boa constrictor in his last agony.
goe "M vJlia” The funeral of Bill beneath the wattle
is only the old, “ bush burial ” over again. We have read
K 7 bush burials, and in 7!) cases the corpse was named
l/il • in all the other cases it was Jim... . Ancient
One” - We pass; also we turn it down.... W .11.0.
(Erndina): Is this poetry, ot what?
their tiie Camps of the Swaggies or travellers that W eary
tllats come in from the Back in order the tune for to spend
“ Ben Sun” : “Australia’s Flag ” is decent verse, but,
after all. a flag is only some cloth on a stick, generally
used to flourish aimlessly over dead bodies ; and we don t
really care if Australia has no flag at all. A nation that
is worrying about its flag generally lias no time to take
care of its freedom. Flags were invented as an incentive
to Jingoism... “J. C—y ” : The device of your alleged
country editor is too ghastly in its awful idiocy....
“ Joseph Bishop ” : We decline, for reasons which come
under the heading of profane language, to “ publish the
enclosed at the present moment and send cheque
“E R ” (G.P.0., Melb.): Crude and feeble. The foolish
countiy-gii’l and the evening-dress villain are hackneyed
themes ... “ Polype ” : What is the moral ? Is it that
one should never put off till the morrow (lie suicide that
can be suicided to-day ?....“ A.R.” : Thanks for sugges-
tion that tiie fat men of the N.S. Wales .National Ass.
should be boiled down and the tallow sold for the benefit
of the Broken Hill strike-fund. Evidently you aren t
particular about ycur tallow ; still the cry of “ shoot- ein-
down” has grown monotonous, and “ boil-’em-down
would lie a good war-whoop to raise in reply
“ R Stewart ” ; An insoluble problem, and, like the ques-
tion’ of where Jonah was when the whale went out, of no
use in anv case.,., “S ” : Damp, green frog-story is well-
written, 'but lacks incident “Yelyr”: Eminently
dreary, and the woman who is “ too tired to go shopping’
is an outrage. A woman will go shopping even when
she’s dead Heaven must either be full of shops or empty
of women... “Walter Samuel ” (Melbourne): Un-
suitab'e. Send it to some paper with a “ Boys’ Column.”
“G.8.V.”: Illegible, written in pencil, on both sides
of the paper—three faults which would sink the four
evangelists ... “T. Hynes”: When debts are made irre-
coverable, Hie man who gets another to work for him and
declines to pay would simply hs gaoled for obtaining
value under false pretences. The object of the suggested
reform is to aboiisli credit, hut between employer and
employe it can’t be abolished—either the one must give
credit for the work or the other must give credit for the
wn«-es. Tiie rule would work belli ways ; if the
gotTpaid in advance and didn't do the work he would be
gaoled a 150.... “ W'.A.P.” (Hughenden): It isn’t exactly a
slory ; seems to be a mixture of dead sheep and coincid-
ence ’ “ Tvn Kelil ” ; We don’t remember “Gone North,”
“ EC.” (Melbourne): Thanks . “ Octopus” (Tasmania):
Received with thanks....“ C.L.” (Mansfield): The story
of a soaked Scotchman arguing with a priest and then
the pair having a drink together isn’t literature
“John B. Graham” (Auckland): The Bulletin hereby
denies “ maligning the dead.” It never even hinted that
Sheehan swindled or tried to swindle a single native in all
his life, and there is no imputation of unfair dealing in
the story. Also, the “refutation” isn’t to hand
“ Beacoiisfield ”; Poem on your departure from an
inebriate retreat is only another evidence that genius and
drink go together. You have evidently given up drink ...
“The Spider”: Tiie fact that you knew Hie deceased
nonentity “from a boy” is just as interesting as if you
had knowm him from a cow .. “ K.C.M.G.” (Rock-
hampton): Thanks “Tramp”: Metre and rhyme
shaky, and, besides, the office drunk says that
your description of delirium tremens is all wrong
“8. Payne”: We don’t know what it is all about....
“Eulo”: Don’t write on both sides of tiie paper. In
tact, it would be better if you didn’t write on either side.
“Socialist”’ Your explanation about Hie “with-
drawal of capital” is interesting, but then, there isn’t
any withdrawal “ F.V.D.” (Melbourne); “ Which is
the greatest republic in the woild?” Well, what do you
mean by “ greatness,” to begin with? Is it size, or wealth,
or capacity to whop Hie nation next door, or what ?
“ Jonah ” ; Tim Bulletin advocates the abolition of debt
—that disposes of Hie man who pays ins insurance with his
creditors’ money. Italso advocates Hie abolition of privi-
leged lawyers—ihatdisposes of the lawyerwho pa.t s hiswith
the orphan’s trust funds. Further, the State should lie
the only trustee....“ Freedom” : The agent who was
shot in' Tipperary is too remote. Besides, the office
Irishman is out ... “A. 11.” (Goulbouni): The red-headed
man who shot O'Grady's pig lacks interest. Half the
alleged humour going is based on a red headed man
and a pig, and Hie other half on a nigger and
a melon “Smallpox” (Brisbane, Q.); There
is no doubt that vaccination from human lymph may
introduce such diseases as leprosy, cancer, syphilis,
phthisis, scrofula, erysipelas, &c. ; that vaccination with
calf-lymph may infect a person with tuberculosis, cancer,
and cutaneous diseases ; that, in short, vaccination may
not harm all persons, yet may possibly harm many ; and,
anyway, compulsory vaccination is vicious and tyrannical
in principle, since it enforces contamination, compels a
person to breed a disease in bis own body, by means of a
penal law. But all this is not to say that i aocination is not
usually a most valuable preventive against smallpox....
“ Colo.” : (1) Dynamite won’t explode merely because you
put it into the fire. (2) Tiie explosion you refer to no
doubt occurred because the man was fo >1 enough to tamp
it with a drill instead of a stick ... “ W.H.S.” (Br.): Your
letter anticipated...." W.C.P.” : Many thanks..,. “Little
Cricket” : Glad to be able to reprint your forceful verses
“C. H.” (Kimberley): Quite right; it certainly isn’t
poetry. And, besides, you don’t yet hear any “ frou-
frou ” in the Kimberley ba'Looms... “A. 0.”: Having
read the evidence as i eported, we can only say that it ill
became Mr. Joseph Napoleon Gannon to prosecute Mr.
Frederick Ogle under the circumstances. . .“fcotty” :
The Worms v. Burr characters probably identifiable . ,
“ M. 8.” (Camden): “Price Waning” says that the
original Margaret Catehpole did die at Richmond in 1819.
Only part of tier story, however, is worked up in Cobbold’s
book. She shared the heroineship with another person
“H. Wynne” (Hamilton): You must tell us the
names of your contributions “ P.T.” (11.): Thanks;
but, not being original, is useless “L. Rea”; Good idea ..
“Gridiron ” (Charters Towers, N.Q.): The history of the
“gridiron ” cases is well known to us. No Act of Parlia-
ment was ever yet framed, and probably none ever will be
framed, that cannot be abused, and worked to Hie advan-
tage of some one of the many powerful syndicates that
run the rule over all other sections of the community
under existing social conditions.... “ Young ’Un ” : Well,
what can we do for him ?....“G.0.” (B.): Can’t the
people of N.S.W. get Local Government, an Irrigation
Bill, &c., &c., without Hie aid of the National Ass? That
animal is adopting a few popular planks in its alleged
political platform as baits to catcli gull-votes; while its
really serious business— the solidification of monopoly,
Hie enlargement of Property privileges, and the disfran-
chisement of the propertyless workers-lies concealed
beneath several layers of bogus patriotism and forced
vomit of “loyalty.”... “Okios” (Kempsev, N.S.W.):
The main objection to privately-owned railways is not
that a dividend-paying company would be likely to charge
Hie public higher rates than would Hie State ; it is a
matter of national principle versus monopoly. Doesn’t
the recent railway insurrection in New Y’oik, U.S.A.,
illustrate any unpleasant possibility to your mind?
“Australian ” : We have no time to have an opinion about
so small a matter “J.J.C.”: Well put... “ Pley-
stowe ”: The basis of Senate representation is to he—for
the South, one member for every 10,000 people ; for the
North, one member for every 8000 people. The latter
advantage is given (says Griffith) because tiie proportion
of producers in Hie North is greater than in tiie South.
A DOMESTIC CALAMITY
Foremost among what may be termed domestic
calamities is the curse familiarised by the name oi
“ moving house.” The man who can look you i;i
the eye and tell you, without dread of sniffing the
odour of sulphur, that he rather enjoys moving
house, is either a hopeless maniac or a person
desirous of stealing the laurels won by the late
lamented Tom Pepper, whose mendacity was so
pronounced as to incur the marked displeasure of
the King of Hades. The worst of moving house
is that you cannot get away from the dread ordeal.
Your wife insists upon your “getting a day off,”
on the twofold ground that it is your duty to
“look after things,” and “besides, dear, I'm sure
you need a holiday.” And what a p euic that
ho iday turns out to he ! From daybreak the
house is iu confusion. You resolve at the outset
to show how courteous and willing you can be
when the occasion requires, and matters hum
along pleasantly enough until your wife, whom
you entrust to hold on to something while you get
a better grip of it, innocently lets that something
drop with unpleasant emphasis on your favourite
coni. This naturally disturbs the calm senility
of your disposition, and you walk round on one
foot and make observations when no one is listen-
ing. Presently the vanmeii arrive, and with that
instinct peculiar to their kind, proceed to stack
things regardless of classification. Under this
administration chaos reigns in less than no time.
Carpets are wrenched from their resting places,
and blinding clouds of dust assail you at every
turn, while outside fresh annoyances are at hand.
You observe a little crowd of inquisitive young-
sters gathered from the neighbouring streets and
houses who form a semicircle without the garden
gate.
In vain you attempt to disperse them ; your best
efforts are made the subject of merriment, and
yourself the butt of der sion. At length the pro-
cession moves off, the k* ys of the vacated tene-
ment are handed over to the agent, and with a
mental resolve that no mortal agency will ever
induce you to move house again, you set out to
encounter fresh trials of endurance in the new
domicile. It is only when moving house that a
man makes the discovery that his domestic stock-
in-trade comprises a variety of impediments that
he might very comfortably get along without, and
it is also on such occasions, when he finds himself
suffering at one and the same lime from a strained
back, a bruised thumb, and a throbbing headache,
that ho blesses the day when so perfect an
antidote to pain as St. Jacobs Oil was discovered,
its value as a remedial and curative agent attested
by actual and incontrovertible results.

ITHOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 515 George Street,
, Sydney, in the colony of New South Wales, do hereby
solemnly and sincerely declare as follows ;
Whereas, I suffered severely from a very troublesome
affection of the Nerves, which affected me so much that
I was quite unable to attend to my business. I tried several
Doctors and many Remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas,
I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr Bassmussen’s
PURELY HERBAL “UNIVERSAL ALE ALINE
PILLS,” which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare
COMPLETELY CURED ME within a few weeks, and
although this is over five years ago, I have remained well ever
since.
THE ALE ALINE PILLS also cured my wife, and I make
this solemn declaration, conscientiously believing the same to
be true.

A REAL MAN OF MARK.
“Herr Rassmussen’s Cures are so remarkable that we
make no apology for referring to some of them. Mr. Rama-
den’s case is the most wonderful, and his remedies cured him
in six weeks, after m: ny Sydney doctors gave him up. We
may also state that a gentleman in this district, who has
been a martyr to the demon Dyspepsia for more than two
years, after trying several “doctors” with no benefit what-
ever, is recovering under Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal
Remedies. Herr Rassmussen possesses undoubted skill, and
we wish him a long life to continue his useful mission in the
cause of suffering humanity.”—Kangaroo Valley Pioneer,
N.S.W.
A JUST REWARD.
“Herr Rassmussen, of whoso famous Herbal Remedies
everybody has heard, has held the position of Lecturer to
several Botanic Societies in Australia; he soon became
known by the wonderful cures effected by his remedies, of
which he has numerous tokens of gratefulness, including a
beautiful Gold Medal, brought him into the front rank of
botanic scientists. We have seen and examined letters from
all parts of the world—are assured that he has saved a world
of suffering and cured people of many complaints, after they
had given up all hope.”—The Australian Workman.
—Sydney, 9th January, 1892.
WHO IS RASSMUSSEN?
“ Herr Rassmussen is a wonder. We have sufficient
proof that his Remedies have cured thousands. He was
awarded a Gold Medal for his Alfaline Remedies, and ho is
author of some valuable Medical Works. We hope he will
be as successful in Victoria as he lias been in New South
Wales.’’—The Essenden and Flkmington Chronicle and
North Melbourne Advertiser.— Ist July, 1892.

Proving the Wonderful ALFALINE REMEDIES to
be Genuine.
“ Herr Rasmussen’s, the celebrated Danish Herbalist,
well-known Herbal Remedies have been the means of per-
forming many great cures during the last few years, as his
numerous testimonials will prove.”—Sydney Bulletin.
“ Herr Rassmussen has shown us some highly compli-
mentary Testimonials which he has received certifying to
important cures effected by his remedies.”—Sydney Evening
News.
“Herr Rassmussen counts the cures effected by his
Remedies by thousands, has already acquired an Australian
Reputation, and has secured the respect and gratitude of
numerous patients whom his Remedies have restored to
Health and Happiness.’’—“Centennial History of N.S.W.”
“We have been shown some excellent Testimonials of
the great cures performed by Herr Rassmussen, the Cele-
brated Danish Herbalist’s remedies.” — Australian Stab.
“ Herr Rassmussen is too well and favourably known to
the Australian public to require any additional praise from
Truth. His Herbal Remedies are unequalled.”— Truth.
“Herr Rassmussen, we are glad to say, as a Medical
Herbalist, holds the highest place in the. Colonies, and enjoys
the confidence of many of the leading people of N.S. Wales,
Victoria, and Queensland.” — Cooktown Courier (Q.).

I send yon a photograph
of our ‘twin’ baby girls, taken

been fed entirely on your Mai ted

little mortals, whose lives were
despaired of, they have thriven
and become quite chubby and
jolly little specimens of baby-

have been entirely free from

say your food was recommended

post us the photographs back at
your convenience.
Yours very faithfully,

an rticle as JOSEPHSON’S OINTMENT purely
the production of the colony, com posed of wild plants
indigenous to the country and nowhere else, the
principal of which is the EUCALYPTUS, now
so famed thoroughout the world.
Josephson’s Ointment is purely vegetable, and
Guarantked Eeke from au Poisonous
Qualities. No Artificial Colouring, as the
Green colour is extracted from the pure green
plants, which defy imitation.

u'I'UJJY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
IO STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a welbknown
citizen: —
Statutory Declaration.
_ “I, George Hewett, do hereby solemly and
sincerely declare as follows :
“That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt-street.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
general depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
ROW’S
DANDELION
BITTERS.
We recommed these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day ; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, in more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY
CHARLES CURTIS, M. R.C.S., England.
Port Adelade, October 30, ISSG.
Read an expression of thankfulness received
from the undersigned
“I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feeling of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced
an unexpected and wonderful effect and change
in my system, and has removed from my mind
the horrible depressed feeling and former con-
dition of bodily ailment 1 have so unhappily ex-
perienced for so many years.
“ I am glad of the opportunity to make known
the excellent qualities of ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, that those who are affleted as I have
been may take advantage of them.

Apropos the cabled statement that Labou-
cherc was omitted from the new Gladstone
Ministry because Queen Victoria didn’t like him.
None of the dailies have alluded in their obituary
otices to the. real cause of the extinction of
‘‘Bob Lowe’s ” political career. When Beacons-
Uyirl introduced his Royal Titles Bill, Lowe,
who opposed it, divulged the fact that Queen
Victoria had tried to induce the Liberal Cabinet
to make her Empress, but had signally failed.
Lowe’s speech gave mortal offence to the Court,
and the Queen declared she would never again
receive him as a Minister. To salve his feelings,
Gladstone made him a lord, and thus finished him.
We have received from a Brisbane photo-
grapher what is evidently intended to be a crush-
ing refutation of the theory that the Queensland
Kanaka business is virtually slavery. It consists
of a photo, entitled “ Queen street in 1894,” and
represents a Kanaka in an eye-glass, gloves, long
cuffs, a huge bell-topper, and top boots, meeting
another Kanaka in a loud check suit, an eye-glass,
a supercilious smile, and an umbrella. The former
individual is accompanied by a dusky lady in a
bonnet, a pair of stays, frilled continuations, and
a lace parasol; and the latter by another dusky
lady iu a divided skirt, a lace parasol, and an
affable grin, and a murky infant in a kilt, and
carrying a pot of jam. Attached is the inscrip-
tion, “Is this slavery ?” Apparently it isn’t. As
far as The Bulletin can make out —after viewing
the lady in the garment before alluded to, and
making due allowance for the obvious want of
pants in the case of one gentleman—it is only
plain indecency.

of Drogheda, visiting Australia, was so struck with it that
he introduced it in Ireland, and certainly it will become
universal all over England. As tipsters, Bond and Augur
Chapman were equally bad ; each made big hits on which,
so to speak, they lived for years. Bond struck four
winners out of five races one V.R.C. day, early in his
writing stage, jusc as Chapman made a prodigious spot -
stroke score on the eve of his vault to the Australasian ;
and another fellow called “Warwick” once did the four-
out-of-five trick—a thing which the tipster can hardly
live down, however he may degenerate. But the tipster
declines as he waxes fat and leaves off touting.

Memmott v. Evans, billiard-match, Melbourne,
brings out the question whether immense breaks are not
made simply by the chalk instead of the ball, the chalk
making a roadway, as it were.
* * #
The idea that “something had been done ” to
the table on which Memmott scored his big screw-back
break is only pardonable for the reason that the perform-
ance was so very extraordinary. It seems absurd to
suppose that the cloth could be specially “ faked ” with
a view to one particular stroke, and as Evans could find
no more “ depression ” than admitted of the reasonable
explanation that the red ball bad done it he will have to
persuade himself that he was fairly beaten bv a freak of
skill on Memmott’s part. The pace at which the ball
had to be potted puts the genuineness of the feat beyond
question by unbiassed minds.

Dear Bulletin,—We had a tug-of-war last week
in this God-forsaken bush township, and it ended badly.
I don’t think the tug-of-war is the thing it is cracked up
to be. There were twelve men on either side, and it
would have been a pretty even thing but for a new-chum
German, over six feet high, that Jimmy, the publican,
roped-in at the last moment. He overset all the calcu-
lations. Everybody wanted to bet on the German’s crowd,
and Bill, the other publican, took all the odds that were
going till he stood to lose over £2OO. The tug
came off in the roadway opposite Jimmy’s pub., and
everybody was there. Just as the men got down
to business and the rope was stretched tight a shabby-
looking stranger ranged up alongside the big German,
and said something in the Teutonic language and in a
gentle undertone. The German was so wildly surprised
that he let go the rope, and the other side gained a foot
before he got hold again. Then the stranger said some-
thing else, and the Teuton began to foam at the mouth,
and shifted round uneasily, and while he was shifting
nearly eighteen inches more were lost. At this point,
we began to suspect something wrong, and Jimmy
the publican seized the stranger by the collar, anil
dragged him away, but while he was being shifted
he yelled out another mass of strange language, and
right there the German let go the rope altogether, and
with a wild shriek of “ mein frail 1” he ran for his home a
mile and a half away. The tug lasted just three seconds
after that, and all our money was scooped in by Bill, the
other publican, with a hideous grin on his countenance.
We are all cleaned out. It turned out that the stranger
had been telling the simple-minded German that his
infant had a fit at home and was choking to death, and
that his house was on fire, and his eldest son had been
trodden on by a bullock. When he heard these things
Fritz made superhuman efforts to finish the tug-of-war so
ns to get away and put out the fire, and rescue the baby,
and pick up the damaged son ; but when the other man
told him that his wife had fallen into the tank and that
his sister was being murdered by a sundowner, he let
everything go and ran for it. I think this sort of thing
ought to be put down.—Yours, &c., Titus Salt.

A horse yarn from up South. Two owners, X
and Z, had horses entered for the big Handicap, and each
feared the other’s horse only. After a little shuffling
they agreed to do a trial over the distance, weights up
and both to back the better horse. After the horse had
gone about two furlongs, X’s horse fell into the rear and
pulled up dead lame ; the other finished excellently well,
and Z, condoling with his unfortunate friend, hurried in
and backed his horse down to oto 4. When the actual
race came off the lame (?) nag went to the post and,
beating his field at the distance, won as he liked, his
owner netting a nice sum from the books, and the
majority of the totalisator money. How was it done ?
Well, get a piece of fine cafgnt, and brushing the hair up
just above the fetlock tie the catgut firmly round the
joint and brush the hair down again. It defies detection.
When the pressure through galloping comes on the
sinews the horse soon feels the pain, and there j’ou are !
A warm fomentation takes away any ill effects. That
this happened is a very solemn fact.

Dear Bulletin,—The Leichhardt (Sydney)
Rowing Club has written the Victorian Rowing Associa-
tion offering to send a crew to compete in the Inter-
colonial Champion Fours, to bo rowed in Melbourne in
October. The proposed four do not altogether fit into
the definition of an amateur under Victorian rules, but if
this difficulty is got over it is asked that the entry may be
received as a N.S.W. Champion Four. Whatever the
V.R.A. may do about accepting the entry, a crew taken
from a single club, and that club outside the pale of the
N.S.W. Association, cannot by any stretch of definitions
ha ranked as a champion four. In connection with the
bona-fide and manual labour trouble the writer cannot see
anything to prevent the manual labour clubs coming
under fie present Association, on a separate footing, but
enter into racing competition with the bona-fide amateur
they must not. The writer is not penning these lines on
the idea that a man who carts bricks or wields a sledge is
not (it to row in the same boat as a man who handles a
quill, but simply on the ground that all chance of the
av erage (piilldriver gaining a pot would be at an end.
And, under such circumstances, is it reasonable to expect
the clubs who have worked under difficulties for years in
the interests of non-manual rowing, now that all" is plain
sailing, to step out and allow the manual-labour cuckoos to
usurp their nests ? Not much.—W.

Re the proposal to send Redleaf) to England :
The long sea-voyage may have much injured the late
James White’s youngsters, which had to stand on deck
for several weeks. Instead of the long voyage, the 'Frisco
route should be adopted, and the journey could be broken
at Auckland, Honolulu, and through the States, so that
the horse need never be more than a week at sea. Ring-
master travelled from India only to England.
The Eucalypte Lozenges for colds, made by
Colemane and Sons, are unsurpassed.
It is a good rule to accept such medicines as are

perience of thousands proves that Ayer’s Cherry
Pectoral is the best medicine ever used for throat
and lung diseases.
Dear Bulletin, — Concerning your par. re Th e
Agent: That horse was originally purchased out of th e
Mt. Gambier Pound, and found its way to Narracoort 6
(S.A.), where he was owned as Traduoer by A. Hinckley,
and stood as an entire, but with poor success. J. £)■
Furlonge, then a travelling agent for the A.M.P. Society,
wanted a horse for saddle or buggy, and admired the
fat, glossy little chestnut, and gave Hinckley a trifle over
£20 for him. Furlonge drove him to Mt. Gambier, and it
was at Fred Harris’ (Mac.’s Hotel) that Sandy Miller, who
was training there at the time, persuaded his owner to
let him give the horse a spin. Miller’s good opinion was
borne out by his winning his first three races at Border
in the mud. His career in Western Victoria was more
brilliant than his owner’s, and after that all Australia
knows his repord. These facts can be verified by hosts of
your readers, and may serve to contradict a lot of silly
yarns I have heard about this truly great little horse.
He was named “The Agent” after his then owner’s
occupation.—Yours truly, S.A., Boorooma, N.S.W., via
Brewarrina.

Worthless Imitations.
Dear Bulletin, —You give the so-called
Australian Institute of Journalists a push up
every now and again. Why is this thus? What
has the loud-sounding Institute got to say for
itself? David Syme and several of the whip-hand
gentlemen figure largely on its list, and it starts
out to smash and confound the libel-law. Very
good, but the said libel-law is chiefly the bosses
funeral, after all. Why is no effort made to stop
the cheap and nasty English weeklies that have
suffocated so many local productions ? The
freelances of Melbourne regard the Institute as
a daily-paperman’s concern, and ate “not in
it.”—Yours, Snell.
A year or two ago the billet of postmistress
fell vacant in a South Queensland township, and
the advent of the lady who now holds the position
is still remembered with horror by the magistrate
before whom she signed the customary declara
tioh. She was a massive person with a deter-
mined countenance, and had evidently been
accustomed to write her signature on a sheet of
bark with a fire-stick. When the document was
put befoi’e her she remarked that she didn’t sec
how she was to get her autograph into that little
bit of a thing, and then she seized the pen with an
air of desperate resolution, drove it into the ink-
bottle, and started. Her Christian name spread
right across the paper, and then her surname
slopped over on to the table and spread all over
it, and started to climb up the wall, and when
she had got as high up as she could
reach she had still half-a-dozen hieroglyphs left.
But just then the P.M. stopped her, and said that
the signature wasn’t legal if any of it was con-
structed out of the province, and the part of it
that spread across the border couldn’t be taken
into consideration, and moreover, he pointed out,
very few civil Servants could read their own signa-
tures, and none of them ever expected to be able
to read those of other people, therefore he
suggested that the lady should go away quietly,
and he would submit that portion of her autograph
which was on the paper, and if she had no objec-
tion they would let the bit that was on the_ table
and the wall slide. They let it slide accordingly,
and the lady got the appointment and holds it to
this day.
The singular death of an elderly lady from,
it is stated, suffocation, but more certainly from
fright, which occurred at Katoomba (N.S.W.)
last week is the last episode in a sequence of
tragedies. Married while in her early teens, her
first husband was lost in the Dunbar. Again
marrying—this time the son of one of the few who
justly won distinction by public work in N.S.W.
—her second husband also came to his end sud-
denly. While his and his wife’s fortunes together
totted up nearly a hundred thousand he was
under the delusion that lie was poverty-stricken,
and committed suicide in and from that belief.
She, after an interval of widowhood, married once
more, but the dread of poverty induced her to
enter into a most extraordinary arrangement with
a person well known in political and financial
circles. This was on the basis of an annuity,
during her own life, in consideration of which she
made over the fee of valuable Sydney property,
the transaction now resulting in a tremendous
profit for the financier. As if this was not enough
to distinguish the woman’s life—or her death
from the ordinary, it may be added that a
deaf mute in Glasgow (in no way con-
nected with her', at present living in poverty,
comes into possession of a life-interest in Bris-
bane property worth .£25,000, and that with
her passes into the grave the key to one of the
hushed-up mysteries of Sydney society a genera-
tion ago. She gave “ Brice Waning ” the matter
for a strongly dramatic story—which he is now
free to tell. She died intestate, after making—
and destroying—a score of wills.
Sir Henry Parkes has announced that he
is engaged upon a work entitled “Eminent Aus-
tralians.” It lias been Sir Henry’s fortune, as he
has often told us, to have been brought into con-
tact with every man of eminence who has strutted
his hour upon the stage of Australian history for
the last four decades. And, we may add, it was
his misfortune to have come at one time or another
under the lash of every one of them. It will be
interesting to notice how he deals with his old
opponents in regard to whom he has at least this
satisfaction, that he has outlived them all and is
still well, vide birth-notices in the press.
How, for instance, will he treat Dailey, who once
said of one of his insolvencies that if Parkes lived
much longer he would rule over a nation not of
friends or electors but of creditors, and followed
this neat piece of satire up by remarking of the
Parkes schedule that it read “like Leporello’s
catalogue of the amours of his wicked master, or
like a parody upon the character of that immortal
Churchill who could take with the same grace and
the same ingratitude half a million livres from his
Imperial Majesty of France and twopence half-
penny from a British drummer-boy?” And
what will he say of Darvall, the English
aristocrat, who, on one memorable occasion,
upon the Maitland hustings, turned back his
superfine cuffs with the remark, “And now I
have to deal with a dirty subject ’’—the subject
alluded to being the identical Parkes who is now
engaged in begetting young Parkeses and writing
about Darvall aforesaid ? And Deniehy—who
described Parkes sitting in the library at Parlia-
ment House constructing political schemes, “quite
as intricate but not half so clean as those which
used to engage his attention in his little turner’s
shop in Hunter-street” —what of him? How
often did William Forster lash the hermit of Bal-
main with that iron flail of invective and satire
which he knew so well how to wield ! Is Forster
to be included in the “ Heminent Horsetralians ”?
And will Parkes also include Sir Alfred Stephen,
whose memorable remarks, &c. &c. ? Anyone
desirous of prompt and imperishable fame should
produce a companion volume to Parkes’ which
might be called “ Eminent Australians upon
Parkes,” For the latter has at least the credit of
having provoked by far the best and bitterest
things that eminent Australians have said or
written, and a collection of these would be much
more delicious reading than the volume at present
gestating at Hampton Villa is at all likely to
prove. Parkes may treat of Australian politicians
well enough if he can conquer that insane and
overweening vanity and jedSousy which prompts
him to regard himself as first and the rest no-
where ; but when he comes to deal with pro-
fessors of belles-lettres like Dailey and Deniehy
and Forster, he will fail miserably. The literary
instinct he never had, and as a critic of literary
character he is as impossible as he is as a poet.
Literature has tried him and ejected him as
something foreign, unpleasant, and utterly
indigestible.

the rocks of the extreme cape, in a manner so that
it floats free, opposite Terra del Fuego,” in the
Magellan Straits. “Each passing ship sends a
boat to take letters out and put others in, &c.,
&c. Is this correct? I have been through
Magellan Straits several times, both as chief officer
and commander, having to land mails each trip at
Sandy Point, a Chilian settlement. I never heard
of this wonderful mail-cask chained to rocks.
Such a fixture would be impossible at Cape Pillar.
Cape Virgins has no settlement, I think ; it had
none in the sixties. I know of no other cape there.

Dear Bulletin, —Can anyone explain why
Adam Lindsay Gordon made such a mess of Ins
classical allusions ? Take the following instances
(from fourth edition of his poems) -.—Page 2, we
find, “Polyrena.” This is a rasper, as the name
is so well known to lower-school boys. Page
“Mors (jratam, vita brevis.” This is a howler’
Page 157, “caro pejus.” Page 158, “nunc s
unquam, nunc aut nunquam.” Surely not Latin .
Page 160, “ caro fortius. Page 209, “ Aphrodite ”
rhymes with “light.” This is a very sore afflic-
tion. lam rather ashamed to pose an advocatus
Diaboli, for some of Gordon’s things are so good
that one might pardon these slips; but I have
some hope that his friends may explain that he
never saw these poems in book-form, while he
might not have been able to correct errors when
they appeared in newspapers. —W. P. Howlett,
Pahiatua, Maoriland.


Sydney EcHO-tesques :
He (the prisoner) stated that he offered to go quietly to
the station if released from the torture (the “policeman’s
twist ”), but he was disregarded, and one of the constables
gave him the black eye, which he exhibited, just as he
was being dragged into the station. Constable Fullerton
said this was a fabrication, the ecchymosis having been
conferred upon him by the depraved woman with whom
he had been lighting.
“Gootvorte!” Again:—

sometimes enables the learned knight to enliven tire
chronic monotony of equity or ecclesiastical appeals by a

The Jackson Party’s Dodge.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Old Bluegum had the shanty at the ballast-getters’
camp—
The usual slie-oak depot of the usual navvy stamp ;
’Twas built of tattered calico and canvas and old
sacks,
And boxes held together with fencing-wire and
tacks.
The beer was served in pannikins—imperial pints,
I mean;
The rum was forty overproof, but tempered with
benzine;
Old Bluegum kept no other stuffs, and not too
much of those.
For “traps” were apt to come along, and traps
were Bluegum’s foes.
They had a most unpleasant way, these trooper
fellows did.
Of getting shanty-keepers at the Court fined
“ thirty quid,”
And if he saw them coming, and rolled it out,
perhaps
He’d find his hard-earned tangle would be soaked
up by the chaps.
Now, business had been languishing, and twice
had he been fined,
And Bluegum, then, to “make a punch ” applied
his thoughtful mind ;
Things had been mighty slow with us since Bricky
Welsh’s fight.
So Bluegum’s proposition was received with much
delight:
“You coves,” he said, “from Jackson’s don’t
fight with Brown’s no more,
You don’t seem on for poker, and you're not
inclined for gore,
I'll tell you how to make things hum-we'll have
a tug-of-war !”
Now, “Jackson’s” was a boarding-house the
engine-push fed there—
A lot of stuck-up puppies, tco, those swagg’ring
oil-rags were;
And if there was one joy we craved, we chaps who
stayed with Brown,
’Twas giving Jackson’s engine push a real good
taking-down—
From Bill who drove the loco., a six-foot hulking
lout,
To Jim the kid, who greased the wheels, and
cleaned the donkey out.
We sent a challenge, therefore, to them, saying—
“ Are you game,
You hungry-looking objects who disgrace old
Jackson’s name,
To pull us for a pound a man, with twenty men
a-side ?”
And Bill, the loco.-driver, then with brevity
replied—
“ We’re on —but when we’ve done with you, you
coves’ll wish you’d died !”
’Twas down upon the railway-line we went to try
our strength,
We’d cleared away the ballast about forty sleepers’
length
To get a good stiff purchase to brace our feet
against—
We wanted it, I tell you, when the whole of us
commenced
To lie down to the tussle, at the word of Jack the
Png.,
And forty fellows started on that most heait-
rending tug!
For nearly seven minutes from the time we set our
sails,
The sleepers cracked, the fish-plates bent—we
thought we’d curl the rails !
With muscles up on stiffened arms, and glaring
eyeballs, then,
A sight to be remembered long was that three ton
of men !
An inch we gained—an inch we lost—another inch
got back
There hasn’t any trouble there ’bout hauling in
the slack !
But Billy Brown, our captain, said: “They’ll
crack up all to pot,
They haven’t got the bottom that you quarrymen
have got;
For putting toughness in a man, the best concern
of all’s
The twenty-one pound hammer that you use to
quarry spawls.”
And soon there wasn’t half a doubt about our
captain’s tip,
We gained an inch —a foot—two feet! we had
them on the whip !
Another foot! we raised a yell! we had ’em fairly
done !
That yell was just what cooked us—if we’d held
it, we’d have won!
For hardly had we settled down to finish with a
“ whoosh !”
Than seven devils seemed to hold that engine-
driving push !
We tugged like twenty bullock-teams, artistically
cussed,
We strained at that infernal rope until wo nearly
bust.
Our tongues hung out about a foot, we hadn’t time
to swear,
For we were licked by Jackson's push before we
were aware !
They ran us off like infants, and, as Bill the
driver’d said,
We wished, with one united wish, the lot of us
were dead !
We paid the stakes to Jackson's crowd, but I
really didn't think
They’d go straight off to 1 Ir.cgum’s and not ask
us to drink !
They did ! (he thieving, sn a' i ;g crus, and added
to their crime
By sing’ng'out—“We'll dr'nk yv r health and
wish you luck next tin e !’
Then gloo nily we loafed arum I, and not a fellow
spoke
(Wo would have gone to Bluegum's, 100, hut
every man was broke ;
The pound a man we could have stood, hut that
was not enough,
For every blessed fool of us had bet, and lost, his
stuff),
Till all at one? old Brown came out with a
tremc nclous swear.
And shook his fists, and pranced around, and tore
out chunks of hair.
And pointed to the rope and said, “Gehenna!
strike me blind !
D’ye see the darned infernal donkea-nnjinc hitched
behind ! /”
We looked, and not a man could speak for a
minute, say, or more,
And then the very rope curled up to hear the way
we swore !
For Jackson’s end man, when we yelled, had let
go at the back
And round the donkey-engine drum had wound
six feet of slack,
And then had set her going—she was nine horse-
power full
And wo had nearly killed ourselves in trying that
to pull !
Said Brown : “ We’ll go to Bluegum’s, and we’ll
scatter round some wool! ”
But when wo got to Bluegum’s, where those
scoundrels should have been,
Two traps were there, a lookin’ round, and Blue-
gum wasn’t in ;
He’d seen the troopers coming, and had cleared off
to the bush,
And then his beer was collared by that thievin’
Jackson push !
They’d rolled it to old Jackson’s tent, and straight-
way put it down,
They’d got as drunk as Chloe, without spendin’
half-a-crown !
And when we tried to slaughter ’em , ’twas we who
<'jot done brown !

The City Minins’ Man.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Spot his highly-polished “ topper,” note his patter
glib and proper, and the neatness of his flogger,
and his linen spick and span ;
See the cable at his pocket, and the twenty-ounces
locket, he’s the model and the picture of a
Melbourne mining man.
He’s a swell—observe his bingey-and there’s
notiiing dull or dingy ’bout his dainty patent-
leathers and the di’monds in Ins shirt ;
He’s a clubman, and ho gailj does the Block in
numbers daily, he's a mining man who never
moved a shovelful of dirt.
’Tis this party, ’cute and clever, whom admiring
papers ever love to speak of with effusion, as
the speculator bold
Who has risked his time and treasure, and his
5 comfort, in a measure, just to boom the droop-
ing industry of burrowing for gold.
At a spread or christ’ning function, speakers dwell
with warmth and unction on the enterprise
and energy this “ miner ” docli display,
And each rapturous oration proves his benefited
nation owes the gent, a debt of gratitude it
never can defray.
Then the money he’s invested gives the journals
interested further chances to enlarge upon his
virtue and renown,
And hurl curses at tire workers, at the strikers
and the “shirkers,” whose actions tend to
raise his risks and keep his profits down.
Strange, they never speak at feeds or at their
guzzles, of the deeds, or of the losses of the
men who’ve only work to throw away,
And the pluck that they exhibit, who are working
on a “ tribit ” that has given barely tucker for
a twelve-month and a day.
Tom and Dick may work like asses in the water
and the gases, whilst their babes are often
hungry, and their wives grow weak and thin,
Then, suppose they chance to strike it, well, the
company doesn’t like it, and it bounces them
on law-points which the bosses always win.
’Tain’t the sweating men —poor devils ! —down in
stifling lower levels, getting loaded full of
poison or the miner's pet disease,
That the rags feel interesting; life and limb are
they investing, but the nation doesn’t seem to
owe a penny piece to these.
No, the mining man they bow to and the miner
they kow-tow to is the mining man of Collin
street, who never gripped a drill.
And who wouldn’t know the crosscuts from a
handsaw, but, of course, cuts quite the fattest
kind of figure as he swaggers on his skill.
He’s the man who does the lying, and the selling,
and the buying, and who raves about his
rights—those rights he cherishes so well ;
And who handles all the treasure, and enjoys
abundant leisure his rewards for having
noodles on the bifurcated shell.
Let those gentlemen repining o’er the awful cost
of mining, ask the gaudy Melbourne miner
why this painful thing is thn»,
And the party who announces that the cost of
every ounce is so much greater than its value,
go to him and raise a fuss.
He’d no great amount to start with, now quite
cheerfully he’ll part with many hundreds for
the razzle his ambitious wife is giving;
And below, in slopes and faces, scores of workers
take their places to provide this gilded loafer
with a poor excuse for living.

Dear Bulletin,“Neither of your corres-
pondents tells the whole story of Blind Tom, the
woodcutter of Lefroy. Ht; had his back broken
in five places, and one ear b'.tten off trying to
capture the Dora Dora blacks years ago. They
were young men at that time, too. lie still goes
out, selects his fells it, makes some fiddles
and pianos and tiling and comes home to supper
at (i. He uses an American axe.—Boiling Billy.
The article on the late police-magistrate
Pater in S. A. Register— written evidently by
Rowland Rees, ex-M.P.—contains an occasional
piece of fact thrown in with obituary statements.
Here is one : “ He hated cant and that Pharisaism
which his and my experience teach secure position
and power here as elsewhere.” In Adelaide,
Chief Secretary Cockbnrn who really holds re-
markably enlightened views about religion—gets
np at a Salvation Army meeting and prays that
Cod may bless “ the work.”
One more nigger has been duly scragged
by the strong arm of the law at Gerald ton (W.A.)
on a charge of murder. A settler named Waldeck
had lost, or said he had lost, some sheep, and with-
out any ceremony he seized the nearest native by
the hair and tied him up to a tree, whether with
a view of committing a brutal assault upon him,
or shooting him, or keeping him prisoner without
law or evidence for an indefinite time, doesn’t
appear. Also, as Waldeck is dead now this point
will never be cleared up. During the white man’s
absence the aboriginal escaped, and discovering
this fact Waldeck mounted his horse and went in
pursuit. He presently overtook the heathen, and
deliberately tired at him four times, and then
the black individual (much the better shot of
the two) threw a spar by way of response,
and Waldeck was nev .of any more use. The
jury hesitated to convict at first, on the ground
that the white man being the aggressor, the
aboriginal was probably using his weapon in self-
defence, but the court pointed out that Waldeck
must have either fired on one side or over the
nigger’s her 1, else he would hare hit him, and under
these conditions the other fellow was acting un-
justifiably. Therefore, no nigger is allowed to
shoot back in W.A. unless he has been killed in
the first place; if ho deends himself before he is
killed he’ll be h.fbgod, and if he does it after he is
killed he’ll naturally be dead. Sentence of death
by hanging, as usual, the Lord being requested to
have mercy on a small vboriginal’s soul. This is
no burlesque: our narrative is based on the evi-
dence as solemnly reported in the W.A. papers.
