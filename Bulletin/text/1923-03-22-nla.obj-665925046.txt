The Red Page
A Modern Satire
Messing about in Bookseller s’-row when
I was a boy 1 found hundreds of sa ceres
in the penny, twopenny and fourpenny
boxes, the prices graded according to the
bindings. Being a boy I bought some of
them; the prices were right and the books
looked solemn and learned on the shelves
in my room; and that was enough for
me then. 1 read a few pages of a couple
of them ; and that was enough for me, too.
The satirical would appear to have been
the most popular method of the 18th and
early 19th centuries because it is presum-
ably the easiest. Done badly, 1 suppose
it is the easiest; and these twopenny works
were done badly. Later, I read more of
them before 1 scrapped them or gave them
away; and I made what I thought was a
discovery. If my judgment is not hope-
lessly at fault I proved that quarter-cen-
tury-old discovery the other day.
The spirit o£ satire is charity. Behind all
irony, all comedy, all burlesque, even all
slapstick farce, there must be true charity
if the oblique method is to reach its pos-
sible height and power. That’s old, of
course—“laughter and tears” ; Pierrot; the
beloved clown; and on and on, down to the
poisonous this-hurts-me-more-than-it-hurts-
you attitude. But I think its technical
significance is often missed or insufficiently
stressed in the million or so books written
on the subject to date. Keenness and hard-
hitting are over-admired and .given too im-
portant a place in examinations of this
mordant art. Cleverness and wit get more
than their share of solemn applause, too.
Style is over-stressed, as it nearly always
is in criticism. All the secondary equip-
ments of literary technique are held up
as if in satire they became primary, which
derogates from probably the most telling
method of expression in use, pulling it
down to artificiality and rigidity.
Swift was not a better man strangled
by hatred of his fellow-man; he was a
poet forced astray—-you can feel that in
nearly every line he wrote if you stop chas-
ing the shrewd blows or the smut for a
minute. And every poet begins with too
much love of his fellow-man; that’s one
of the reasons why he gets it in the neck
so often. Unfortunately, Swift took the
getting-it-in-the-neck too seriously; and the
result was sorrow all round —fear and hatred
in life and bad criticism after death. He
is the greatest of the satirists —greater
than Voltaire, who is more conventional in
his cunning and cruelty—because of his
ineradicable love of his fellows. This is
all statement, I know; but why is “Gulli-
ver’s Travels” a kid's book to-day? And
under what heading does “Letters to Stella”
come ?
Thackeray and Samuel Butler help the
evidence. Thackeray was a slightly senti-
mental toady who buttonholed people in
clubs and egregious Mayfair drawing-rooms,
buttering them smoothly with one hand
while he gbntly pointed out with the other
that they w r ere hucksters and snobs. He
was very clever and he told very good
stories; but he was no more a satirist than
I am. He despised the people he flattered
and criticised instead of,, liking them, which
my alleged discovery contends is the essen-
tial. Samuel Butler has a great vogue to-
day as a satirist; but, out of sight and
sound of the vogue, isn’t “Erewlion” pre-
tentious and artificial, a literary exercise
in too constricted a manner? Butler hated
everyone; lie was even so limited and fana-
tic as to "hate his father and the ideas and
emotions his father stood for. That’s no
good; a blind man can’t show you anything.
If the author starts, by hating his audience
he can’t hope to win it over. His end is
justly the penny-box, despite his technique
and the little vogues that come and go.
Sterne, the greasy-eyed sentimentalist, is
better; he was overloaded with charity at
times. And he does win his audience. So
does the hearty bonhomie of Smollett and
Fielding. Lewis Carroll is also a good
exhibit. Shaw —the Fabian, subversive,
reforming Shaw —is another. Belloc and
Chesterton I pass by; as satirists they seem
to be journalists—l can’t get the strength
of the fuss they make about negligible
things except from the joyous standpoint
of space-rates. Max Beerbolim has a deli-
cate knack of irony; his matter is full of
finesse and apparently empty of, love of
anybody but Max. But I should place him
as a technician pure and simple. He excels
in the short paper which must be well
done, but is not supposed to matter very
much. “Zuleika Dobson,” his most sus-
tained effort, is dull.
Harry Leon Wilson’s “Merton of the
Movies” is the proof of my discovery
which I have taken so long to reach. The
Story is quite simple. A clerk in a store
takes a correspondence course in movie-
acting. He saves his salary week by week
and finally goes to Hollywood burst-
ing with ideals. He makes good as
an unconsciously burlesque imitator of
stars, the aforesaid ideals supplying the
unconsciousness for the differing pur-
poses of a hard-headed director and
a bonzer girl. He marries the bouzer
girl and becomes a fixed burlesque star him-
self. Three-quarters of the book is most
interesting detailed information of the man-
ner of making movies. y For the rest the
story is a satire pure and serene and sym-
pathetic, the satire I like best in all those
I have read since I bought them at bulk
rates. I have seen no screaming reviews
of the book, big man as Wilson is; most
of the critics seem to consider “Merton” a
rather nicely-written demonstration of the
making of movies. But I don’t think my
judgment is at fault. I have read the book
three times in a fortnight; and I hope to
read it a good many more times.
The book is real —vivid and true in the
light, of the author’s love of his characters,
his strong charity. I am hungry still for
more of Merton’s child-like simplicity; for
more of his brave starving; for more of
his young ' ideals, his cracking-hardy when
they broke, his expressive reticence. And
I’ll never get enough of Sarah Nevada Mon-
tague. It is a story of youth, sweet and
sane and sympathetic as it can be.
Yet throughout the treatment is satiri-
cal. Not once does Wilson make a point
which is not ironical or semi-ironical. The
book is a model, of technique in the reti-
cent, oblique manner without the least
obtrusion of the technique. To me it dis-
closes the ultimate possibilities of this man-
ner. I am satisfied that only thus could Wilson
have shown me so much by leaving out
so much and making me laugh at the little
that is left in print. It is a masterpiece
of suggestion—full, vivid suggestion which
is better than statement.
HILARY LOFTING.
A Plea for Honest Thinking
The Mind in the Making, by James Har-
vey Robinson (Harpers), seems to have
been inspired by Wells’s famous dictum that
history is coming to be “a race between edu-
cation and catastrophe.” The author calls
for clearer thinking as an alternative to
serious social trouble, if not the downfall
of our civilisation. Much that he says in
the first section of his book is commonplace;
but it had to -be stated as a foundation for
his main thesis.
Few of us take the pains to study the origin of
our cherished convictions ; indeed, we have a natural
reuugnance to so doing. We like to continue to
believe what we have been accustomed to accept as
true, and the resentment aroused when doubt is cast
upon any of our assumptions leads us to seek every
manner of excuse for clinging to them. The result
is that most of our so-called reasoning consists in
finding arguments for going on believing as we
already do.
Of course, the resentment felt by the aver-
age man against a new intellectual view-
point, whether it involves church, political,
legal or any other sort of reform, goes
“deeper than his dignity. Self-interest, enters
into the matter. The resentment of the
churchmen of the Middle Ages against the
reformers was the resentment of a Dooley
against the A.L.P.; of a W. M. Hughes
against his critics; of any royal family
against its republican subjects. The. Church
was a huge vested interest with its own
courts, laws and prisons; its own territory,
and, till well on in the 15th century, an
effective power greater than that of any
king. To this day the ire of the Catholic
historian who deals with Tudor England is
aroused as much by the thought of the stolen
church lands as by the consideration
that Luther’s triumph meant the partial
downfall of the Kingdom of God upon Earth.
To arrive at an understanding of what the
media*val churchmen felt it is only neces-
sary to have a three-minutes’ talk with any
modern citizen who has been robbed of his
savings, or suddenly thrown out of the job
he was doing, as he considered, honestly and
well. The spirit of reform, man’s yearning
to leave the world more enlightened than he
found it, has never shown signs of dying
yet, and it will not till the world begins to
die. And so the churches still have their
reformers. It is a melancholy indication of
the brief step that has been made in toler-
ance and the capacity for detached thought
that churchmen should be using precisely
the same arguments, and suggesting precisely
the same punishments, in respect of the
innovators of to-day as they did in the 16th
century. Thus a clergyman wrote to the
Sydney Telegraph a few- days ago
arguing that the Modernists (who in the
Anglican and Presbyterian churches com-
prise practically all the best of the clerical
minds) should be thrown out as traitors to
the faith.
It is for this class of mentality, a mentality
which is under the terrible compulsion to
believe in ideas which it cannot bear to see
approached from a logical standpoint, that
“The Mind in the Making” has been written.
And, as the author suggests, there is none
of us who is entirely free from such preju-
dices. Aristotle was exiled, Socrates was
.executed, Galileo incurred the thunders of
the Church for the same crime that the
Telegraph's correspondent considers should
be punished to-day by excommunication—
that of thinking without relation to the
(mostly inherited) beliefs of the majority.
All these daringly original minds were dis-
figured, however, by environmental bigotries,
even as is the mind of Dean Inge, who finds
it as hard to believe in an England gov-
erned without the assistance of the class' to
which he belongs, as the bishops of Henry
Vlll.'’s time did to believe in the survival of
a State entirely divorced from church gov-
ernment. Anyone who had tried to convince
Sliakspeare of the merits of a sovereign
democracy would have met with short shrift,
and our views regarding the status of women
would have struck Milton as dangerous in-
sanity. There is real value in such books
as this one of Mr. Robinson’s to the extent
that they make us uneasy. Are capitalists
in the mass a gang of bowelless robbers? Is
the Labor party composed of Bolsheviks, and
is a Bolshevik as black as he has been
painted by the. propagandists—the same pro-
pagandists who during the war laid it down
that the Huns were the predatory criminals
that they are now making the French out
to be?
The American historian’s work suffers from
its lack of an index, and it is disfigured by
its Yankeeisms. How Bacon would have
winced, for example, to see his ‘'Tem-
po ris Partus Maxima s" translated into “The
Greatest Thing Ever” !
J. B. D.
“Hassan”
The English James Elroy Flecker, who
had already made his mark a.s a lyric poet,
left behind him at his tragically early death
a completed play, which was published by
Heinemann late last year. It is to be pro-
duced upon the London stage, and mean-
while the reading of it has been as a draught
of living water in the desert of contemporary
literature and drama.
“Hassan” is the story of a confectioner
of old Bagdad, fat and, 45, and of how he
came to make the ‘‘Golden Journey to
Samarkand”'-—it culminates in that lovely
lyric by which Flecker was already known.
The motif of the play, however, is the Car-
pet, old and unexpectedly choice, which is
in the little room behind the shop. For
there is a sensitive soul in Hassan’s elderly
and ridiculous body, and in these two days

Gum-Dipped Cords
of action the Exalted Designer of human
carpets weaves the colored threads of every
variety of experience into the drab web of
his life. The play itself is a carpet, .too,
of intricate pattern, woven with consum-
mate skill. It is tragedy, it is burlesque ;
it is pathetic, it is exceedingly funny; it is
horrible, but it is always beautiful; and the
setting itself changes with Oriental violence
through many scenes, from the hot life of
palace and street, to the shadowy garden
given over to the ghosts under the pale light
of the moon.
Through the crowds that revolve round
the Holy, the Just, the High-born, the
Omnipotent, Haroun-al-Raschid the Caliph,
move the principal characters, clearly de-
fined : Hassan the tradesman, who remem-
bers that he is an artist, the artist who
never forgets he is a tradesman ; Ishak, the
poet, who has made his home in a palace
and half forgotten it is a prison; Masrur,
the executioner, the most disgusting negro;
Yasmin, the world’s own stupendous harlot,
whom Hassan, simple Hassan, would woo
and win with sweetmeats glowing like his
carpet (“globes of crystal, cubes of jade,
polygons of ruby ; sweets like flowers ; great
red roses, passionate carnations”) ; Rafi,
King of the Beggars, who would burn all
Bagdad to kiss a woman’s lips again; and,
lastly, Pervaneh —Pervaneh, born, like Ishak,
on the rolling hills, the proud, the peerless
woman; Pervaneh, who has walked with
the Friend of Friends in the Garden of the
Stars, and heard the trumpets of reality that
drown the din of the Thing that Seems!
But the Caliph uses his supremacy to play
the artist with the lives of men, and is him-
self a designer of carpets, laying here the
purple of power, and there the crimson of
lust; whelming it all in the gloom-greys of
abasement, touched with the glaring reds of
pain, and edging the whole with the black
border of annihilation. Hassan is in one
hour promoted to be the Caliph’s friend, in
the next cast by him into the depths of
humiliation and pain. Agony is a fine color,
and he delights therein as “a painter in ver-
milion new brought from Kurdistan.” And
before Pervaneh and Rafi is set the choice
between two lives of separation, or a day
of love and two deaths of torment. There
is but one choice for Pervaneh the ecstatic,
and they pass through their one day’s sun-
shine into the black horror of their doom.
Then breaks the gentle heart of the fat con-
fectioner, like the lute of the Poet. When
in the garden the ghosts rise to welcome the
new brother and new sister before the Great
Wind sweep them asunder —the Great Wind
that shall blow together the souls of those
as yet unborn—the tinkle of the bells of the
Caravan is heard without the. Gate of the
Moon. Thither, dressed as pilgrims, come
Ishak, free again, and Hassan, leaving all
behind him but the little old carpet of his
soul, to set forth from the City of Fornica-
tion upon the Golden Journey towards the
Unknown.
We travel not for trafficking alone;
By hotter winds our fiery hearts are fanned ;
For lust of knowing what should not be known,
We take the Golden Road to Samarkand.
“Hassan” is a great achievement —a won-
derful piece of work. How it will act re-
mains to be seen.

Mrs. Macquarie’s Journal
Amongst the treasures in the unique col-
lection of Australiana in the Mitchell
Library at Sydney is a little brown, leather-
covered MS. book—of the sort used by sur-
veyors for field work —which contains the
journal kept by Mrs. Elizabeth Henrietta
Macquarie, the second wife of Governor
Macquarie, during their voyage from Ports-
mouth to Sydney in 1809, on board H.M.S.
Dromedary. The first entry in it occurs on
May 15; the last is on Christmas Day
of the same year, when the two ships, the
Dromedary and the Hindustan, transport-
ing the new Governor and his regiment, the
73rd Highland Light Infantry, were beating
up the coast of N. S. Wales against the
strong nor’-easterly winds prevalent in the
summer months. A week later the Mac-
quaries landed in Sydney, which was to be
their home for a dozen years.
In Macquarie’s own journal, under the
date of March 26, 1805, he very solemnly
records the event of his proposal to the
lady who shared his throne in N. S. Wales,
and gives a little of her pedigree.
After very mature and deliberate consideration and
reflection, on all the consequences of so important
a step, I took an opportunity of waiting on Miss
Elizabeth Henrietta Campbell (the youngest daughter
of my late second cousin, John Campbell, Esq., of
Airds, in Argyllshire), at the house of her aunt.
Mrs. Campbell, of Cowhen, in Wigmore-street; and
finding her alone I made a full avowal to her of my
sentiments, and of my sincere love and ardent
affection for her ; explaining fully to her at the same
time, previous to her giving me any answer to this
declaration of my sentiments in her favor, the
utter impossibility of our immediate union, nor
until after my return from India—which I promised
should not, if possible, be delayed beyond four years
at farthest.
The lady, however, was not called upon to
wait for her really very sentimental lover —
though you would not suppose him to be
such from the above passage—for much over
two years. They were married towards the
end of 1807.
The diary is written in a fine, angular
Italian hand —curiously like that of her hus-
band —and is full of interest, quaint and
minute observation of men and things, and
the characteristic sly humor of the well-edu-
cated Scotswoman. It is a delightful little
book, and every page of it speaks eloquently
of a charming and good woman.
When they arrived at the Cape of Good
Hope they met Colonel Johnston, John Mac-
arthur, and others wffio had been concerned
in the deposition of Governor Bligh. Mrs.
Macquarie made some observations on the
subject.
We had a good deal of conversation with Dr.
Jameson regarding the extraordinary events which
had taken place in N. S. Wales, and it appeared
to us that even by their own account the conduct
of those persons who had acted against the Gov-
ernment was not to be justified, or even excused ; we
felt sorry that a Man such as Col. Johnson was de-
scribed to us, should have committed himself as
he has done bj' an act of the most open and daring
Rebellion, by which, in as far as it appears to us,
he will probably forfeit! a life, which has, till this
unfortunate period, been spent in the service of his
King and Country, Colonel Macquarie felt it quite
a relief to him, his having quitted the Colony before
his arrival, and by that means having spared him
the pain of taking measures which the service
required, but which no officer could feel easy at
being obliged to have recourse to, particularly on
this occasion, Col. Johnson being a man of amiable
character, and in their early years an intimate com-
panion of his own.
She was greatly diverted by the pomposity
of Dr. Harris, when, on being shown a draw-
ing of Ultimo House in Sydney, she
inquired why the place was named so oddly.
Dr. Harris, with an air of the utmost importance,
strutted up to me and said, “I can explain that
to you, Madam; I was once summoned to attend
a Court-martial; the gentleman in reading the
charge happened to say this Court being convened
on the 12th ultimo, instead of instant; they were
not classical, but I, Madam, being classical,
immediately perceived the mistake. I ridiculed them
and wrote verses on the subject, and afterwards
called my home Ultimo Place.”
There was much hospitality at the Cape,
and Macquarie was often ashore late at some
convivial gathering in one or other of the
messes, which vied with one another in
entertaining the officers of the 73rd. Of one
of these “great Regimental Feasts” she
writes with gentle disapproval. It had been
given by Major Campbell, commanding the
72nd.
. . . .He gave them a magnificent dinner, and in
the true Highland style the Piper play’d all the
time, and after the Cloth was removed ehter’d the
room marching round the table to Mr. Pringle’s
great annoyance. Major C., who has a very slow
formal manner, address’d Col. Macquarie in the
m„st serious manner, saying that it was their
usual custom on these occasions to have three coursts
(that is, three rounds of the Piper about the table),
but that as Mr. P. did not seem very partial to it,
he would dispense with the third courst; Col. M.
very wickedly said that Mr. P. liked it above all
things, and beg’d it might go on. The time
bestowed upon this entertainment was far beyond
all reasonable limits. These late hours were a serious
distress to me, and on that account only I felt very
glad when the time for our quitting the Cape drew
near.
The last entry in the journal, which is
mostly devoted to the preparations being
made for the ending of a voyage of which
all had grown weary—it had lasted more
than seven months- —contains a prettily
expressed paragraph :
We dined this day with the officers. I felt it
quite a pleasure to meet them all once more before
we land in a sociable manner. I feel attached to
them all, and happy in their company.
One closes the pleasant record with a
sense of regret that Mrs. Macquarie did not
keep a similar charming record of her life
in Sydney. Possibly she did, but if so no
one knows now where the journals are.

Psychology and Politics
Psychology has not yet found itself. The
word is in everybody’s mouth, and whatever
it represents is supposed to have hundreds
of thousands of students. Yet it is doubt-
ful whether those who are professedly its
students know much more about it than the
millions who make no such profession. For,
consciously or unconsciously, everybody is
a student of it. To define it is not easy, but
it may serve to say that psychology is the
science which treats of human behavior.
Now, everybody is interested in someone’s
behavior, and will study it to the extent
of being able to say what that behavior will
be in given circumstances. The meanest
beggar in the street depends upon his know-
ledge of it. The biggest captain of industry
would crash if he did not know a great deal
about it. It is a serious question, however,
whether either of them could go to the hun-
dreds of books which have already been
written on the subject with much profit.
They would certainly discover a vast number
of terms which have been invented to de-
scribe various processes and operations; but
these they would find of little or no prac-
tical value.
It is not, therefore, surprising to find
Professor Rivers (Psychology and Politics;
Kegan, Paul) at the outset warning his
hearers —for this is a volume of lectures—
“not to expect too much.” Though nobody
has written more in English than he on the
subject, and though he was president of the
psychological section of the British Associa-
tion, he seems to realise that the preten-
sions of the psychologists have been much
greater than their performances:—
There is now a serious danger that psychology will
fall into discredit, partly owing to the zeal of its
votaries for the unconscious and infantile aspects
of the mind, but still more owing to premature
attempts to utilise its supposed discoveries practi-
cally, while the basis upon which they rest is un-
certain and insecure. It may even become a matter
of ridicule to make those references to psychological
explanation and interpretation which now arouse
such hopes and interest.
Perhaps that would not matter very much if
it did not affect the progress of some other
things. No study is capable of taking a
wider sweep. “Human behavior,” normal
and abnormal —a study which includes all
that is bound to touch almost every science
at some point. The old-established sciences
can take care of themselves. But new
ones, like psychiatry, which is concerned
mainly with the study of the brain in ill-
health, must not be allowed to suffer from
the charlatanism which has made psychology
its cloak. And meantime the study of human
behavior will proceed. It costs too much
to neglect it. A generation ago Sydney put
a quarter of a million of money into what
it called the Queen Victoria Markets; and
because the projectors and architects either
misread or disregarded psychology the city
has been losing £lO,OOO or so a year on
them ever since.
Yet the half-baked psychologist would pro-
bably have said something about the “herd
instinct,” and approved of this lumping to-
gether of a hundred small shops under one
roof. No word has had a more blessed sound
to the psychological theorist than “in-
stinct” ; yet uow Professor Rivers is driven
to the conclusion that “purely instinctive
behavior is almost unknown in the case of
the higher animals, and especially in man.”
He argues that “directly innate behavior is
modified by experience. .. .it is no longer
purely instinctive.” According to this view
every instinct must gd back to the dawn of
time. In that case there is probably but
one instinct—the general one of self-preser-
vation and perpetuation—and every means
to that end has been a matter of develop-
ment. It seems a too-narrow view. For
thousands of years Australia had no flesh-
eating animals; and many of Ws birds nested
and rested on the ground. Then came the
imported fox. and one bird after another is
taking to trees. Surely that is instinctive.
Dr. River-s delivered the three lectures
which give this posthumous volume its title
after, he had accepted the Labor party’s in-
vitation to be a Parliamentary candidate
for the University of London. He delivered
them—certainly the most remarkable elec-
tion addresses ever addressed to a consti-
tuency—mnd died four months before polling-
day. His interests had been extraordinarily
wide. He studied medicine, and was for
a time a general practitioner. Then he
turned his attention to neurology, and was
Zf rr unat l
, between diseases of tile mind
and the body. Research m that direction
inevitably led on to experimental psychology.
Groping for help, he turned to anthropology
and ethnology ; and it was in this connection
that he came in contact with the brilliant
Australian student, Professor Elliot Smith,
.a. oAnHiK.Uoc o ri'i], „ ; *
o CORtnbutes a foievoid. 11l lectuie in
which Rivers tells how he and Elliot bmith
came together will .make a *vider appeal
than anything else in the volume. Rivers
originally accepted the old view that “the
similarities between the beliefs and customs
of different peoples are due to the unifor-
mitv nf thf> civiTstitntinn nf tho 'human mind
ltv Oi tile Constitution ot the human mind,
SO that, given Similar conditions of climate
and conditions of life, the same modes of
thought and behavior come into being inde-
pendently.” But he had to throw that over-
bosrd * for hup fornid srniflst
Doaia, ior simiiamies are round amidst
exteinal conditions Oi tile most diverse
kind. It was while studying the
possibility of a great dispersal of cul-
ture from Egypt that Elliot Smith’s
researches met him : and they are
now both-—or were both—quite satisfied that
«j» .preud from the Nil, east,
thence thlOllgll the Malay Archipelago to
New Guinea, from island to island in Poly-
nesia to South America, where, local condi-
tions being favorable, it was responsible for
that Inca civilisation of which there still
,• i , r , i
remain astounding evidences at Cuzco and
elsewheie in leiu. In 1919 a missionaiy
in, the Solomon Islands wrote an account of
the burial customs of the people of San
Cristoval. Rivers declares that they “re-
produce exactly” characteristic features of
ii , J . r ,1 . _, .
the mortuary customs of the ancient Egyp-
tian. Also :
Mr. Fox [the missionary] describes a structure
like a pigtail which reaches down to the stone sur-
face upon which the statue is placed. Mr. Fox
writes to ask what this strange feature, quite unlike
any existing head-dress in Melanesia, can mean, un-
aware that he is describing an almost exact represen-
tation of a similar feature of the statues of Cheops,
Chenhren and Mycerinus, the builders of the great
Pvramids of l<>vpt.
, j
Incidentally, the Solomons were so named
bv 16th-century Spaniards who, having sub-
the people of Central America, went
out aftei the countries from which lying
Solomon obtained the gold and precious
stones and timbers for the building of the
Temple. Maybe King Solomon’s men had
never been there ; but there is strong evi-
flpnce that mariners from other of the earlv
d . en .C e m V ™ 1 nf u tL ; u
civilisations ot Egypt or thereabouts had
been. If we ask how they got there, we
can only answer that the world has made its
great mistakes before this day of Lenin and
Trotsky, and has paid for them by periods
of degeneration in which it lost much of its
knowledge. Some of it we have not recov-
ered to this day.

Casanova’s Homecoming, by Arthur Schnitzler
(Brgntano). Anatole France once wrote an un-
historical memoir of Pontius Pilate in his old age
which robbed fhe Roman ‘of his Biblical importance,
J !‘ .“Casanova s Homecoming ’ Schnitzler follows a
similar line ot gentle derision in a romance m which
(j le WO rid’s greatest gallant is made to feel both the

The lady of his choice is captured by a trick, but
the point of the episode is the awful revelation of
the old reprobate’s age at the height of his triumph,
This is the main feature of a book which includes
some actual happenings, such as, for instance,
Casanova’s rejoining the Venetian service as a spy.
But the yolume is happiest in its inventions. Thus
there is a deep ironical humor in the suggestion that
Casanova spent many a futile hour in trying to write
a polemic to devastate Voltaire.

Do not rely upon creams and
powders to conceal blemishes that
Palmolive Soap so easily removes.
HORUS.
In Egyptian religion, many gods are often
fused into one, thus Horus, son of Isis,
appears in many forms. On one occasion,
to confound the enemies of Ra, as a
Winged Disk he flew up to
the sun, and was afterwards
called " the great god, the
lord of the sky.” " Horus
Eyes ” were carried as a charm;
the right eye symbolised the
sun, the left the moon, thus
protection was secured by
day and night. Another
familiar form of Horus is that
of the Hawk.
Women of ancient Egypt, wor-
shippers of Horus, preserved
their beauty by daily cleansing
with the same beneficial oils
of the palm and the olive we
recommend to-day.

Test this free trial cake, let us
show you how good Palmolive really
is. Fill in the coupon and post to-day.
nwM'O achieve or to preserve
£ skin health and beauty
you must begin at the
beginning. It is useless to
apply cream, rouge and
powder to a skin not ready to
receive them. First cleanse your
skin, for few skins are really
thoroughly and entirely clean.
Surface cleanliness is not enough.
Every minute pore of the skin must be
freed from particles of dust and powder
accumulated every day. Thus perfedly
conditioned, your skin will certainly
require less powder or rouge than is
used by the average woman, and it can
take no harm from their application.
How to attain this perfed cleanliness?
Ordinary methods will not do. That
is why, in Palmolive Soap, we offer
you a better soap, a real cleanser, one
that will penetrate the very pores cf
the skin—a soap that iij its cleansing
action indeed "begins at the beginning.”
Cleopatra, famous for her beauty, and
the elegant women of her time used
the oils of the palm and the olive in
the daily ceremony of cleansing which,
with them, amounted almost to a rite.
Centuries divide that wonderful civilis-
ation from our own, yet science, in
search of the perfect cosmetic, has
found nothing to compare with these
same valuable oils to cleanse and
soothe and beautify the skin.
But it does offer them to-day in an in-
finitely more pleasant and convenient
form than in their earlier crude state.
Experts now blend them with utmost
precision and embody them within a
cake of green and fragrant soap—
green and fragrant by reason only of
the precious oils of the palm and the
olive it contains.
How to use c Palmoli e ve
Work up a profuse Palmolive lather with your two hands, using pleasantly warm
water. Massage it into your skin so that it enters every pore. Don’t be afraid to
be thorough. Palmolive soothes while it cleanses. Then, still with your hands,
rinse thoroughly and be sure the water isn’t too hot. When every trace of lather
has been washed away, stimulate your skin with a refreshing dash of cold water.
Careful drying will give your face a delightful, restored sensation. Your skin
feels smooth and blooming. Such scientific cleansing will keep your skin fine and
free from blemish or irritation—it is the secret of that schoolgirl complexion.

buried it deep in my brain ;
The gods mixed a strong draught of sorrow
and poured it upon me like rain ;
Then musing, they called one among them
who fashions the dreamings of men —
He culled me small dreams, white and gol-
den, and writ o’er them all with a pen.
Full measure of laughter they gave me and
twined in my hair one fair rose
Whose color and perfume should lead me
through by-ways no other man knows;
Of beauty they wove me a garland, of pain
said, “There shall be no drouth,”
Then burned me with fierce zest of living,
while Love was the thirst of my mouth.
Then deep in a pool of pale shadows and
griefs that are burning and blind
They bathed all my being, and maddened with
strivings my heart and my mind ;
They breathed breath like wine in my nostrils.
and tempered me keen as a knife,
Then, startled at all they had made me, they
hurled me with fear into life.

The Shore-lights.
While screaming gulls above him flock,
All round him ripples fret,
A fisherman upon a rock
Spreads out and coils his net.
The slow tide makes; the shellfish suck
Its welcome waters in;
To-night, if he have any luck,
There shall be fish to win.
To-night, it may be, when the stars
Shine white, and keen, and cold,
Great kingibh, mullet, silver gars,
Ilis straining net shall hold.
He smokes and thinks - ... - Life’s like a sea
Where one nir t sink .or swim.
He’ll swim. .. .though black,'the waters be,
The shore-lights faint and dim.
Through near-by gums, through limb and leaf,
A brisk nor’easter hums,
While, roaring on the outer reef, *
Shoreward each breaker comes.
Hours pass; the waters inward win,
Till swollen is the tide;
He casts his net and hauls it in,
Brown helpers at his side.
A curse—“’Tis empty!” Sink or swim?
Swim always—valiantly !
Yet very far, yet very dim
The shore-lights seem to be.

Bacchanal.
Roaring a song the Wind reeled by,
The Lightning winked a wicked eye,
The Thunder hiccoughed while he laughed,
And deep the Earth her goblet quaffed.
Again, again, she drank apace, .
The fragrant wine ran o’er her face,
And every shrunken, scanted rill
With greedy chuckles gulped his fill.
The jostling Raindrops danced and sang.
Her clamorous chimes old Echo rang
And, waxing bold, with ribald zest
Flung to the topers jest for jest.
But look! A light! They break and flee!
Adieu to wanton revelry !
The wowser Dawn, with lamp held high,
Austere, affronted, walks the sky.

Glimpse.
Here in this room, all gold and white.
Where dusk lies drowned in candlelight,
And low on each blind, shining pane N
The lonely starlight beats in vain,
I turn from love’s half-jesting frown,
From firelit shadows, russet-brown,
And, drawn by night’s wild witchcraft, gaze
Beyond the window’s yellow haze.
A white, slim moon, cloud-haunted, goes
Soft stepping through the dark, where glo\ys
In fading fire across the air
Dead Twilight’s broken, silver stair.
A lost wind sings as far and thin
As some wraith-wakened violin,
Or dreary woodland where each leaf
Sighs its" own desolate dim grief.
A lost wind sings and, lonelier
Than God Himself, the sad stars blnr _ __
Their blind despair of dying light
Across the gulf of awful night.
Life sickens in the frozen stress
Of planetary loneliness,
With horror icy as the breath
Of. the grey waste ’twixt life and death.
As though swung wide, an ether door,
On some black Thule far and fror-e.
Whence creeps as from a dead god’s tomb
A faint Azrael breath of doom—-
A cold despair that numbs the brain,
Till all grows shadow, lost and vain,
And life and time but masks that seem
A hollow nothingness of dream.
Whereof seems pain alone to be
Malefic, mad reality:
Till Love’s voice, softly calling, breaks
The trance and my dead spirit wakes!
And blindly from the haunted pane
Of mirrored fantasies again
I turn from depths where dead stars shine,
And meet your eyes, dear love of mine.
Then life’s fair music of desire
Floods back upon my heart like fire—
Lips to your lips, O life’s delight,
And what reek I of death or night?

UNREPRESENTATIVE GOVERN-
MENT.
One of the truest things Rousseau ever said
was: “The tendency of every form of gov-
ernment is to deteriorate.” When N. S.
Wales first got self-government it was a
fairly compact community, small in num-
bers, with an extremely limited governing
class (less than half the population was
literate), and it was far removed from civ-
ilisation. The machinery age had barely
established itself in Britain and was un-
thought of so far as Australia was con-
cerned; the community had no dreams of an
army or a' navy, much less of participation
in a" world war. It was a prim tive pastoral
settlement, with a small sprinkling of intelli-
gentsia in the shape of professional men
and officials. The form of government which
N. S. Wales imported then is with us still.
The population has enormously increased;
education has so improved that there are
practically no illiterates ; and in place of a
restricted franchise there is universal suf-
frage For governmental purposes, in the
true sense of the word, the State is 30 or 40
times as big as it was when Australia s first
Constitutional Parliament met in 1856. The
chief reason why the affairs of cricket
clubs, golf clubs and the like are usually
conducted to the satisfaction of about
95 per cent, of the members is not that the
latter are less argumentative and captious
than those who compose a modern State in
which about 50 per cent, of the electors are
in a chronic state of rage against the Gov-
ernment : the explanation is that a club is
small enough to give each of its human
entities a chance to express his or her
views, and, if they are sound views, to get
them effectuated. The city-States of ancient
times were in the same fortunate position.
They only grew functionally weak as they
grew numerically strong.
There is another reason for the growing
futility of Parliaments in this country be-
sides the fact that the interests which they
claim to represent have giovin vastly too
big and numerous for them. When trade
unionism began to go ahead here, shortly
after the defeat of Chartism in England,
it was a sort of religion. Australia s trade
unionists of the ’eighties and early ’nineties
were largely idealists who had rejected the
Marxian theories of violence in favor of
the constitutional methods of Fabian social-
ism. There was no profit in being a pmest
of the new religion, and even the hierarchy
in Parliament had, like the Early Christian
bishops, to be satisfied with the reflection
that they were doing good; they made little
or no money by their services. Australia
was suited to the development of trade
unionism, just as certain countries are suited
to the development of certain religions. In
the middle ’nineties the movement, which
had been held back by the gold discoveries
and other fortuitous circumstances, began
definitely to bound ahead. For over a de-
cade now Australia has had more trade
unionists per head of the population than
any other country in the world. Like all
successful institutions, unionism soon began
to attract those_ who are the eventual ruin
of most successful faiths—shrewd characters
who never touch an ideal unless there is
money in it. In the beginning they fulfilled
their legitimate functions, and wrung a.
number of valuable concessions, from the
standpoint of their class, out of the employers.
But there comes a stage, whether in the
case of a towel or in that of the laundry
proprietor who has contracted to get the
article washed, when further wringing is a
waste of time and energy, for the simple
reason that nothing more remains to be
wrung. That is the position in many Aus-
tralian industries just now, and the workers
know it. But the leaders of the working-
class movement who are well dug in, either
in safe Parliamentary seats, or as dele-
gates, or as A.L.P. or other officials, are
naturally-reluctant to admit that their occu-
pations are either gone or diminished in use-
fulness. The obvious tactics of an unscrupu-
lous job-holder in such circumstances is to
create a diversion. That really is the ex-
planation of the local tendency to toy with
the “Red” objective—a game which was
played with remarkable cynicism a week or
so ago by the typically bourgeois Dooley
in an attempt to overcome his enemy
McGirk. The industrial unions have given
rise to employers’ unions, which fix prices
for their goods as the workers do for their
labor, and which control their Parliamentary
candidates in caucus quite as firmly as any
Labor organisation. The net result may be
seen to-day in the N. S. Wales Assembly,
where the Dooleys and McGiRRS are en-
gaged in a discreditable row for jobs on the
one hand, and the Fullers and other Nation-
alist enemies are .battling with equal bitter-
ness, though a trifle less frankly, on the
other. The Labor unionist outside Par-
liament and Macdonell House imagines he is
paying to have the privileges of his class
protected. He is not; he is paying to keep
the Dooley faction or the McGirk faction,
as the case may be, in more or less honorable
affluence. The subscriber to the funds of
Nationalism believes that the chief aim of
his Parliamentary party, hot only as a
party, but individually, is to vindicate
Nationalist principles. It is not. The
energies of most of the members are being
dissipated in an internecine struggle to grab
one another’s jobs. And the, consequence
is the community gets, not sensible, economi-
cal administration —the kind of administra-
tion which has just enabled a suburban golf
club to build a £lOO,OOO club house without
cost to itself—but an unedifying, expensive
and more or less permanent dog-fight. No
wonder the old-time citizen, listening to the
uproar- and the blackguardly charges and
counter-charges, and observing how little is
done and how much he has to pay for it,
observes disgustedly: “If this is democracy
in operation, give me the benevolent despo-
tism of Wentworth’s day!”
The first requisite of good government—
meaning government in the interests of the
whole of the people—is probably to get
unionism (employers’ unionism as well as
workers’ unionism) out of politics. It has
no more legitimate place there than Roman
Catholicism or Juda.sm. If the whole of
the professions unionised for gain (and in
some professions, such as the Church, the
pay is villainously low) : if they returned a
Parliamentary party solely to attend to their
professional mteresus, and if a str.ke of doc-
tors, dentists or amesthetists thus became
one of life’s possibilities, the community’s
sense of decency would be sharply affronted.
Yet the General Strike threat which our
“Reds” are continually holding over the
country’s head would produce more deaths
—chiefly of infants—in a week than a doc-
tors’ strike would in a month. Trade
unionism is acquiring something of the
power that the R.C. Church had in the
Middle Ages; its coercive powers are begin-
ning to be exercised on medieval lines; and
in its continual rows with capitalism (stand-
ing for the mediaeval State) it is bringing
loss and even ruin upon the thousands who
do not conform to the dogmas of either side.
When “militant unionism” has been put in
its place the State will have time to con-
sider its out-of-date Parliamentary system.
To go on calling it. representative, as we
do. is farcical. Thus in N S. Wales the
Assembly is divided into members who hon-
estly try to represent their vast and compli-
cated constituencies, and fail because no one
man is capable of such a task; and members
who represent Bolshevism or a religion or
some other irrelevancy and are blind to
all else; and members who set out com-
placently to represent everything that
promises a cheap advertisement, frpm North
Shore br’dges to the treatment of prickly-
pear lands. Under such an arrangement
the people, while theoretically represented
in all things, are in practice (except in the
cas« of those with a sn°c : al financial or
political pull) represented in hardly any-
thing. A constituent may reach his mem-
ber with* a grievance or a suggestion, and
the member may pass it on to a Minister;
but it leaves the Minister only to be
lost in an entanglement of red tape. The
cure is smaller suites; moie approachaoie
Parliaments; less irresponsible departmen-
talisms. It has been found that a rather
betttr type of man goes into public life
when there is little money in poiit.es than
when the pay is high and the prospects of
boodling extensive. Tins is not so para-
doxical as it may appear on the surface: it
has appLed to eveiy great social movement
in history, up to and including trade union-
ism. So there should be no difficulty in
getting sound local men for as many Parlia-
ments in reason as are created. At present
the enemies of representative government are
being presented with valuable arguments for
Sovietism, owing to the fact that all the
State Parliaments are faced with a collec-
tion of huge problems, any one of which
would try their powers, even assuming the
party system and the eternal industrial
wrangle gave them a chance to do concen-
trated work.
THE REMITTANCE MAN.
The new Minister for Defence, a mild and
unexpected gentleman named Bowden, with
a streak of melancholy, made an early public
appearance at Parramatta, where a great
many well-meaning people have been buried.
He said various cheerless things, including
one about the telephones :
The position so far as our telephone system is
concerned is absolutely hopeless, t or every 2800
applications they could only deal with 1000 at
present. i
Therefore it would seem that, in addition to
being about nine months in arrear, the Postal
Department goes, every now and then,
another ISOO telephones to the bad. Yet
last year the profits of the Department were
over £1,500,GU0. It was the one really
profitable business the Commonwealth owns.
As every new ’phone means more profit the
natural course might have been to supply an
instrument out of the surplus to everybody
who would pay for it, and thus swell the
profits till they reached £3,000,000, or
£4,500,000 or more —in other words, to con-
tinue batting on a good wicket as long as
the wicket held out. Instead, the great wind-
fall was put into general revenue, and
dribbled away on side-shows like the appoint-
ment of “commercial agents to the East,”
who can’t get an unreliable order from a
Chinaman for a few cases of apples, while
the reliable local orders for telephones are
turned down. The trouble w'ouid be a
thing of the bad Hughes past if the new
Minister said breezily that everything was
to be changed, but what he said was rather
to the effect that the country might as well
throw in the towel.
The same low-spirited gentleman had some-
thing to say also about defence, which is his
own department. It was, in a general way,
that nothing is gained by keeping obsolete
war vessels afloat to give the Australian
people “a false sense of security. Every-
thing that Australia owns in the naval line
nowadays is, it is true, obsolete, because,
though the place must be defended on the
sea or not at all, interest in marine matters
is flickering, unstable and short-lived. Still,
the obsolete vessels might give an enemy a
false sense of insecurity, like the wood and
paper guns with which the Turks made a
valuable demonstration at Adrianople ; and,
above all, they might be useful for the train-
ing of young men against the time when
Australia is awake again, and has some
ships that are not obsolete. The present situa-
tion is that the Naval College is established
on a speck of isolated Federal territory,
on the uninhabited shores of a harbor where
ships don’t go, and which no railway ap-
proaches. The buildings are partially or
mostly ruined by white ants, and the handful
of discouraged students, believing that there
is no prospect for them in a great island
that can’t realise its need of ships, are leav-
ing, to make a belated fresh start, probably
as house-agents or bookmakers’ clerks.. The
Military College, on the Federal Capital ter-
ritory, is also in a poor, moth-eaten way,
and it appears, according to Minister Bow-
den, that there is a difficulty about a local
supply of arms and ammunition. These
things are not so very hard to make, and
there are plenty of unemployed who profess
their willingness to try their hands at making
anything. But, this being rather a hopeless
sort of place, the Minister implied that the
cheapest thing would be to give up the whole
naval and military show, and be content with
sending some officers. to be trained in Great
Britain. It' might be rather ignominious
and backsliding and retrograde, after all the
efforts of Hughes to have Australia recog-
nised as a nation, but it would save trouble
to drift back into the old dependent
“colonial” ways. Bowden hoped something
might turn up to save the military and naval
situation, as if it was a lost soul on the
way to perdition, or a half-tide female hang-
ing to a .submerged rock, but he evidently
looked for the worst.
* * * *
At the same time a shipping magnate just
back from Europe gave it as his expert
opinion that there is no hope for the Aus-
tralian shipbuilding industry either. It
often costs as much to do ordinary repairs,
the magnate said, as the original price of the
ark. To build a ship in lingering Australia
costs more than twice the money and four
times the time required in England, so that
vessels are apt to be obsolete when they take
the water. They carry vastly larger crews
than English ones, and coastal freights are
100 per cent, higher. Part of the excess
cost of building is set down to the refusal of
the unions to employ up-to-date implements,
such as automatic drills, lest they should
abbreviate the job. Certainly, since the Federal
Government decided to give up building at
£1.000.000 or more apiece vessels worth
£400,000, the artificial shipbui'ding industry
seems to have done a very sudden drop. The
world’s shipbuilding record for 1922, dealing
wfith 17 countries, has been published. The
Commonwealth, with 12,200 miles of coast,
and wholly dependent on the" sea for com-
munication with the outer world, and with
Tasmania, Papua, the mandated islands, and
(for want of the South-to-North railway)
with half of itself, was lowest on the list bar
Belgium, and Belgium has some 40 miles of
coast-line, and devotes itself to watching its
four land frontiers. With the year’s ship-
output down to ; 12,354 tons (equal to one
moderate-sized ocean boat), the marine de-
fence prospect of this strictly marine coun-
try is poor enough, for no maritime nation
ever became such through sailing in bought
siups—especially loan snips. feo, tbougn it
is a pity that the naval college should be
eaten by ants, it might be a greater pity
than it is. Incidentally, and at the same
time, the N. S. Wales Minister for Railways
told a deputation that the State water sup-
plies are m an alarming condition, had never
been worse—in fact, it seems that the ants
have been at the water also, and it is becom-
ing hopeless with the rest. The position
even of Sydney is dubious. When to these
matters are added the alleged hopelessness
of the N. Territory “problem,” the visible
hopelessness of the Commonwealth trading
fleet, the nopeless deficit on the Port Augusta-
Kalgoorlie railway, the hopelessness of almost
all tbe sinking funds, the hopelessness of
putting thousands of people “on the land”
with tens of millions of loan money only
to see them slide off again, and the apparent
hopelessness of hoping that there is much to
hope for anywhere, it might perhaps be as
wed, in the absence of any scheme of im-
provement, to give up worrying and working
and wearing clothes, and relapse into the
bosom of Nature.
Still, the explanation of the drift looks
easy enough, and explanation points the way
to remedy. The chronic remittance man
has a recognised tendency to be casual, fitful,
unfinished, unstable, unenterprising and a
waiter on Providence. And Australia is
the boss remittance man of the globe. The
six peaceful States borrowed no less than
£89,500,000 in the last two years—just
loafed to that extent on somebody else. It
is years since we tried to earn our keep
and pay our way—so many years that we
have quite forgotten how to do it. But it
can’t go on indefinitely. For there is this
difference between us and the ordinary remit-
tance man: he doesn’t have to pay back his
remittances; we do. And his remittances
are likely to see him through to his un-
honor ed grave, whereas ours are liable to
stpp at any moment. Our remittances, in
short, have none of the merits of his-—only
their demerits; only the effect of making us
drifting and casual and slothful; of filling
our heads with extravagant ideas and our
lives with extravagant practices. Our loan
policy is our supreme curse. It masks our
true position ;, it misleads the whole com-
munity ; it demoralises a great part of it.
Our position is only hopeless so long as we
fail to recognise that.
CHINA IN 1922.
The year 1922 took China very little further
along the Republican road, and on the way
she lost the Constitution. The Constitution
was all the Republicans had to offer for the
people to burn joss-sticks to in place of the
dispossessed Son of Heaven. At the best
it was a poor substitute and never earned
the affection of the “stupid people.” There
is nothing very romantic about a Constitu-
tion. One cannot intrigue about its. future
wife or spend three hundred thousand dollars
on its wedding, as was recently done on the
wedding celebrations of the ex-Emperor,
llsuan Tung, to a Manchu princess. Never-
theless, the mislaying of the Constitution has
seriously embarrassed the new Government
at Peking, whose Parliament is of doubtful
legality, and whose Cabinet is really the
creation of Wu Pex-Fu, the victorious over-
lord of Chihli. Wu Pei-Fit, after his de-
feat last autumn of Chang Tso-Lin. the
Manchurian overlord, retired to his strategic
centre at Loyang, and left the politicians to
consolidate in the administrative sphere his
victory on the field of battle. Wu Pei-Fu
is a plain soldier, or he might have foreseen
what a mess the politicians would make of
it. From Peking comes nothing but reports
of the sordid struggles of mandarins to oust
each other from Ministerial posts, while in
Manchuria, behind the Great Wall, Chang
prepares for the usual Spring campaign;
Ciien Chiung-Mtng, the overlord of Can-
ton, disregards the authority of the Central
Government, and raises independent loans
from British financial syndicates; in Fukien,
little Hsu, the ex-Anfu leader, resurrects
the civil war; and in Shanghai, Sun Yat-
Sen, the father of the Revolution, having
had his coolie armies taken from him, pro-
ceeds to replace them with the army of the
industrial proletariat.
It cannot be said, therefore, that the “de-
cisive” events of the autumn did anything
but make Chinese politics more confusing for
the student to follow, by substituting a new
set of names for the old. The tuchuns still
control the provinces, and when P'eking
transfers them they go to their new posts
trailing their personal armies of coolies and
ex-bandits, commandeering the railways, and
living on the country as they go. Some pro-
vinces are blest with benevolent autocrats
who employ their ragged soldiery at making
roads and bridges, and there are actually
remote provinces where the honk of motor-
horns is replacing the shriek of barrow-
wheels. In others the tuchun is Weak and
has to share his authority with bandits, and
in some there is gradually growing up a local
authority which may some day solve China’s
problem "by making her a federation of pro-
vinces governed by their own popular assem-
blies. Such is Canton, and one of the most
cheering features of the situation is that
Ciien Chiung-Ming and Wu Pei-Fu, the
two most firmly-seated of the military auto-
crats, are alleged to be coming together on
a platform of local autonomy under a Fed-
eral Executive.
Although there was much marching and
counter-marching, there was very little seri-
ous fighting among the tuchuns in 1922. The
clash between Ciiang and Wu, however. left
the various pawns in the game scattered all
over the board, and the process of readjust-
ment has been painful. No vivider picture
of the anarchy which prevails could be given
than the story of the astounding Odyssey of
the Yunnan men, who marched out of their
province, 10.000 strong, to join forces with
Sun Yat-Sen in his ill-fated punitive ex-
pedition against the North. Kuangsi pro-
vince lay on their route, but permission to
pass through it was refused them. They,
therefore, attacked the city of Liucbow, on
the River Lin. captured it, and sat down to
recuperate. Their administration of the city
so gratified the inhabitants that, when they
announced their intention of continuing their


march to junction with Sun’s troops on the
West River, they were asked by the Cham-
ber of Commerce to remain. Meantime, the
home troops had recovered, and were descend-
ing on them from all directions. The Yun-
nanese decided to evacuate Liuchow, and,
commandeering eight motor-launches and a
hundred junks to carry their rice, heavy guns,
ammunition and wounded, they commenced
their descent towards the sea, the effectives,
divided into two parties of a thousand each,
marching along the tow-paths on either bank
of the river in advance of the flotilla. Be-
hind them Liuchow was being looted and
burned from garret to basement by its own
soldiers, and “youthful brides were climbing
up on their kitchen roofs, and then crawling
away over the tinkling tiles to find places of
hiding from the ruffians’ grasp.” The Ytin-
nanese had to fight every inch of the way.
The Kuangsi braves had sworn that not one
of the “Redheads” would reach the v\ est
River alive. At the city of Wusuen big guns
had been placed on the walls commanding
the river so that the boats could not pass.
For three days the Yunnan troops laid siege
to the city. Then, seeing the impossibility
of breaching the w r alls without heavy artil-
lery, the Yunnan men asked for a truce. I lie
negotiations came to nothing, however and
the Yunnan men, realising they were being
surrounded, decided to push on. After sight
days of continuous fighting the West River
was reached, but meantime Sun Yat-Sen s
punitive enterprise had collapsed, and lie
himself was a fugitive in Shanghai. Ine
Yunnan army was, therefore, left m the air.
If Yunnan had been a maritime province
these heroic ragamuffins might have turned
Argonauts, and with their eight motor-boats
and their hundred junks have proceeded
down the river to the sea. defeated the Chi-
nese fleet and returned victorious to the home-
land ; Yunnan, being an inland province, they
had no alternative until the political situa-
tion changed but to stay where they were
and consolidate their position. \\ Inch they
did by capturing and occupying three cities.
Towards the end of 1922 the most signifi-
cant event of the year occurred: Russia
reappeared in the Far East as a great Power.
That the Bear had not changed his spots or
suffered any miraculous rebirth in the fires
of revolution was obvious from the strenu-
ous efforts of M. Joffe, the Plenipotentiary
of the Soviet Republic, to recover control
of the Chinese Eastern Railway, W'hicli the
Soviet in its first, fine, careless rapture had
voluntari 1 . returned to China, along with
much other Czarist loot of pre-war days. A
glance at the map w'ill show the enormous
importance of the railway to Russia. It cuts
across the rich Chinese province of Man-
churia to Russia’s least frozen port on the
Pacific, Vladivostock. The writer went over
the line in' 1914, and noted the thoroughness
with which the Czar’s Government was
transforming the broad strip of leased terri-
tory on each side of the railway into a Rus-
sian province by planting Russian settlers
on it. The war checked the process, and
the Revolution stopped it altogether. Since
then the railway has been fought over, and,
like a carved-up worm, it has continued to
function spasmodically in sections. When
M. Joffe informed the Peking mandarins
that Bolshevik Russia had renounced the
predatory policy of the Czarist regime, they
coldly told him they would believe him when
his Government returned Mongolia to China.
He got, however, a warmer reception else-
where. He was enthusiastically—in fact,
reverentially—welcomed by the representa-
tives of 14 Radical Chinese organisations;
and Tsai Yuan-Pei, the head of the Peking
Government University, whose students
advocate, among other things, anarchism and
free-love, and who has almost as much pres-
tige with Young China as Sun Yat-Sen,
informed him that China, in the coming re-
volution, would model herself on Russia.
“Please accept,” said he, “the hearty wel-
come of the pupil to the teachers.”
In a country where the vast mass of the
population are illiterate, but are imbued
with an hereditary awe of learning, the literary
freelance, the student, even the, raw school-
boy, possess enormous influence. M. Joffe
appears to these impressionable people
(■reaching a new gospel. He is able to
point to the recent conspicuous successes of
tile Bolshevists in the international field —-
how Japan, after expending a thousand mil-
lion yen in pouring 75,000 troops into Siberia,
lias been compelled to withdraw; how
Turkey, under Bolshevik patronage, has re-
covered her territory and Germany her self-
respect. Every fresh movement of Western
and Japanese aggression against China gives
(he communist a new argument. Even the
Republicans are fed-up with the republican-
ism of the last 10 years. If the intellectuals
adopted communism as a creed they could
force it on China when they liked. And
400 million Bolsheviks in Asia wo'uld create
a probably insoluble problem for the world,
unless Chink solved.it herself by disappearing
in the ruins. The impact between the com-
munist creed, based on the dictatorship of the
proletariat, and the ancient Chinese system,
founded on respect for the ‘.‘superior man,”
would be like a typhoon amongst a fishing
fleet.
FENG-SHUL.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Shall We Loaf on Mother?
There are three distinct schools disseminat-
ing views on Australian naval defence. The
Labor party, which used to be a national
party, and which, in that capacity, was
chiefly responsible for the coming of the
R.A.N., is now an odd blend of pacifism and
truculence. It proposes, apparently, to hold
Australia for high-wage white workers with-
out an army or a navy. If the R.N. makes
up its mind to look after the country, well
and good : but the Labor party insists that
the country shall not pay for the intrusion,
being amply capable of driving off any pos-
sible enemy by sheer weight of jaw. There
are sections in all the parties, Labor in-
cluded, which believe in the maintenance of
the R.A.N. at any price, and deplore the
spectacle of its decay. And there is a hired-
defence party which, though small and
mostly anonymous, is as noisy as the other
two put together. It is composed of a
heterogeneous mixture of Anglo-Australians,
R.N. pensioners, remittance-men, Germans
and Australians who consider they are prov-
ins their loyalty when they sneer at the
Australian flag. The Prime Minister will
shortly have to disclose the general attitude
he proposes to adopt on the question at the
coming Imperial Conference. The anti-
Australians, the people who fought to the
last ditch against that Australian fleet which
was eventually to save the coastal cities of
the Commonwealth from a German bombard-
ment, have a powerful new argument. They
are in a position to point to our huge wav-
debt and claim that we cannot afford to
defend ourselves in an adequate manner,
and that Imperial patriotism therefore de-
mands that we should get the British (who,
relatively, can afford it still less) to under-
take the expensive duty for us—thereby get-
ting a good deal of defence for a small
amount of money. Like all get-rich-quick
schemes, however, this one has a flaw in it.
The British did not provide us with real
defence in the old days; they only provided
the sort of defence we were paying for. Still
less are they in a position to give us some-
thing for nothing now. Nor would it be
worth it if the incredible happened and we
were mean and unpatriotic enough to per-
suade them to do so. True statesmanship
takes other things into consideration be-
sides pounds, shillings and pence. There is
the human-nature factor —the overmastering
force which kills internationalism at birth
and makes wars. Illogical though it may
be, a nation that will tax itself to the hilt
to pay for its own navy or army is resent-
fully unwilling, to disburse the paltriest sum
for a hired defence force, by land or sea.
It is easy to appreciate the point of view if
we imagine a cry to subsidise a British regi-
ment to replace our permanent forces. The
present generation of Australians is not
prepared to be humiliated before the world
by a reversion to hired naval defence any
more than it is prepared to accept hired
military defence. Even if the change could
be shown to be a good business proposition,
it is outside the bounds of practical politics
to the precise extent that it would be an
affront to the nation’s pride. The Prime
Minister may already hold this view ; if so,
it is certain that he will not be permitted to
hold it unassailed for long. But a small
thing like that should not— I The Bulletin
believes will not —stop him from doing what
is so obviously right.
•
The Suggested Federal Convention.
Australia, according to a multitude of
rumors, is threatened with an elected Con-
vention for the complete overhaul of the
Federal Constitution, which might mean the
drafting of a new Constitution, the possibili-
ties of alteration being unlimited when the
work is started. It is to be hoped no such
folly will be attempted ; for the Constitution,
despite one or two defects for which the
original Constitution-makers were not respon-
sible, is a valuable thing, arrived at after
the most careful consideration and deep
study, and it should not be tinkered with in
any wholesale fashion by clumsy hands and
inferior minds. That they would, on the
whole, be inferior appears certain. The 50
men who met at Adelaide in 1897
were, with only two or three excep-
tions, State Ministers or ex-Ministers,
and they were trained in a very different
school from their successors of to-day.
Machine politics were only developing then,
and the State Premier of last century wasn’t
a “pre-selected” figurehead, chased from pillar
to post by the Political Labor League, and
the Labor Council, and the A.W.U., and
hauled up before his judges like an office-
boy whose stamp account won’t balance, and
living amid a cfironic wash of dubious linen.
And these bygone Constitution-builders
weren’t mere dealers in votes; in the year
of the first session of the Federal Convention
they spent £5,500,000 of loan money among
them, and were rather ashamed of their
extravagance. The . present lot spent
£4l 000,000 in 1921, and wasn’t ashamed.
After all, the Constitution requires only a
very few amendments, such, for instance, as
the' striking out of the few words which
appear in italics :
124. A new State may be formed by separation
of territory from a State, but only with the con-
sent of the Parliament thereof, and a new State
may be formed by the union of two or more
States or parts of States, but only with the consent
Qf the Parliaments of the States affected.
If the Federal Government knows what
changes it wants it might at least send them
to the people, as the Constitution directs,
and try its luck before it resorts to a Con-
vention which will certainly not give it half
the studious) care that was bestowed upon it
by the men who sat in Adelaide, Melbourne
and Sydney during the laborious months of
1897-and 1898.
~
The Latest Labor Catfight.
N. S. Wai.es grinned last week when one
of the exuberant gentlemen who are disput-
ing the leadership of the State Labor party
bounced up from liis seat in the caucus-room
and moved towards the door, calling upon
all true representatives of the downtrodden
masses to follow him. Out went McGirk,
the rich landlord, and at his heels trooped
Minaiian, the wealthy boot manufacturer;
McTiernan, a lawyer with a comfortable
practice; McGibr’s brother, chemist and man
of property; Stuart Robertson, retired
storekeeper; Bailey, farmer and A.W.U.
boss ; Dunn, a school-teacher ; Molesworth,
a newspaper man ; Clark, another Bailey
on a smaller scale; and Murphy, who is
something in the house-agent line. The
others, to the number of 10, passed a vote
of confidence in Dooley, the master tailor,
who therefore retains the right to occupy
the Opposition-leader’s quarters and draw
his allowance (£250 p.a.) until the next
palace or proletarian revolution. McGirr s
exit, and the words in which it was
announced, were modelled on the Hughes
precedent in 1916. But the circumstances
are different. So are the men. McGißß’s
political reputation is puny compared with
that of Hughes at the time of the conscrip-
tion split. He lacks the other’s moral cour-
age and pertinacity, and has a fatal habit
of unsaving to-morrow what he said to-day.
Before " the State election, at which his
party went down, it wasn’t certain until the
last moment whether he would retire from
local politics (he had dramatically announced
his intention of going after a Federal con-
stituency), stand again for Cootamundra, or
contest a Sydney seat. One day he inti-
mated that his relations with Dooley, head
of the Government which was hurrying to its
doom and in which he held a portfolio, had
“never been more cordial,” and that Dooley
had “the confidence of the whole party” ; the
next, that the party was being ruined by
“Dooley and his cautious, prudent, oppor-
tunist colleagues.” A man so constituted
might earn good money in a circus for a
Human Chameleon act. But only imbeciles
or desperate adventurers would stake their
political fortunes on his leadership. Again,
Hughes, being really able and resolute in
his fashion, and not a mere compound of gas,
disloyalty and indecision, contrived to quit
caucus with all the honor and glory, and
made his position secure by allying himself
with the Liberals. McGirk has no such
assets or prospects. He cannot even pre-
tend that he has been victimised. The moral
advantage of being able to pose as the in-
jured party is enjoyed, and being fully ex-
ploited by, the exile from Erin. There is
nothing calculated to excite popular enthu-
siasm in the spectacle of a rich landlord
being rushed into the leadership of
an unwilling Labor group, the posi-
tion being already held by a person
satisfactory to the majority, by a coterie
unknown to the Constitution, and composed
principally of disgruntled candidates and in-
triguing A.W.U. bosses, their arrogance
undiminished by the collapse of their last
idiotic strike. And McGirk’s associates in the
unsavory business are a painfully thick-headed
lot. After publicly declaring that Dooley
had “automatically placed himself outside
the movement,” they commanded their
branches not to discuss the matter on pain
of being excommunicated, as he was. This
comes of reading too much rubbish about,
the Russian Revolution. But the one-sided
edict (it wasn’t applied to McGirk or his
supporters) was too strong for even the
N.S.W. unionist to swallow, accustomed as
he is to eating dirt at the bidding of his
petty tyrants, and it has been widely dis-
obeyed. -In most things there is little to
choose between McGirk and Dooley. Both
are political humbugs, only McGirk is the
more amusing impostor of the two. The
accident of circumstances has made Dooley
a defender of popular rights. His cause
is good though his administrative record is
rotten, and it looks as if the other infliction
will uresently discover, as he did before, that
he will have to stay away from Parliament
for a season and buy a few more chemists’
shops. There is no more fight in McGirk
than there is in a frilled lizard.
Theodore Triumphant.
The Rockhampton Labor Convention was a
notable triumph for Theodore. True, the
inscrutable Queensland Premier acquiesced
in the pink objective—-the socialisation _ of
everything by “the constitutional utilisation
of political and industrial machinery”—and
allowed a flock of foolish proposals for fur-
ther adventures in Government ownership,
for which he has lost his enthusiasm, to
pass unchallenged. But on subjects in which
he is immediately interested, and w’here the
policy of his Administration was attacked,
he fought to the limit. And whenever he
fought he won. Hostilities began on the
industrial question, the Convention being in-
vited to discard arbitration in favor of “the
means laid down by the All-Australian Con-
gress of Trade Unions.” That body, being
under the intellectual domination of Russian
agents, had spoken hopefully about “taking
and holding” the means of production by
“revolutionary action.” But delegate after
delegate assured the Convention that the
Queensland unionists had had enough “revo-
lutionary action,” in the form of strikes, to
last them a lifetime, and were sick of the
very sound. So arbitration, the policy of
Theodore, was declared a plank in the party
platform. Next, the Government was
attacked on the basic-wage issue. The Reds
sought to have it condemned for the general
reduction of ss. a week, ordered by the State
Arbitration Court in March, 1922, and for
the application of the decrease to Govern-
ment servants. Whereupon Theodore ex-
plained that economy had been forced on
the Government because, “at the end of
1920, as a result of the London boycott, the
finances were absolutely 'exhausted.” Re-
trenchment was carried out at the expense
of temporary hands, such as navvies, and
then the basic wage was reduced from £4 ss.
a week to £4
The Government at that time was faced with a
critical position. Since its accession to power it
had granted the public service increases of, approxi-
mately. £2,000,000 per annum —practically all the
increased revenue it had received. I look the stand
that Government employees could not he treated
differently from thousands of other employees out-
side the service. An anti-wage-reduction committee
was formed, all the permanent public servants being
represented. I met the committee, put my whole
hand on the table, and told them how grave the
position was, but they would not yield a point. In
tact, they put a pistol to my head and said I must
retract or they would take action to make me. 1
afterwards discussed "the position with the Labor
party, and intimated that, if the stand I had taken
was not upheld, it would have to find another leader.
It is something new for an Australian Labor
Premier to behave in that fashion. After a
stiff fight the Convention approved of his
attitude and rejected _a proposal to restore
the basic wage to £4 ss. a week and have it
fixed by Act of Parliament. It also defeated
an attempt to exclude members of Parlia-
ment from the A.L.P. executive, which device
would have enabled the Premier’s domestic
enemies to declare him “outside the move-
ment,” as happened to the luckless Dooley
in N. S. Wales. After that Theodore had
things his own way. At his instance, the
delegates declared against (1) Imperial titles,
(2) prohibition polls after the one this year,
and (3) the mad notion of giving the vote to
flappers and cockerels of 18. They also sanc-
tioned his plans for the extension of co-
operation among the cockies and for the
teaching of agricultural science in Govern-
ment schools. In short, the Convention had
lucid intervals. But the Premier cannot be
held guiltless of adding the Golden Casket
gamble to the Labor platform. That abom-
inable proposal was carried by 45 votes to
15, and apparently Theodore went with the
majority—anyhow, he spoke against a sug-
gestion that a tax on the profits of racing
clubs should be substituted for the Golden
Casket. Had he been as bold in this matter
as in others that have been mentioned, he
might have freed Labor from the peculiar
infamy of being the onlv party in any Eng-
lish-speaking country that has adopted a
degraded lottery, lawless everywhere else, as
part of its financial policy. It is a pity, for
in other respects the man really seems to be
learning the business of government. Cer-
tainly, Queensland has paid prodigiously for
his education.
The N.S.W. Prison System.
Dear Bulletin, —“J.H.M.A.” causes me to
suspect either his sincerity or his sense
when he says (B. 15/3/’23) :
Why “2nd Divvy” should suppose that a captain
in the R.N. should be a competent judge of “eye
wash” passes my comprehension.
I assume an R.N. captain to be a judge of
“eyewash” for the reason I assume an
R.11.A. colonel to be a judge of a horse. It
is his job. “Eyewash” in a “sick bay”;,
“eyewash” in a shore hospital; “eyewash” in
a gaol—they are all the same, just as curbs
and spavins are the same in a Clydesdale
and a polo-pony. This particular apologist
also strikes me as either dull or disingenuous
when he says, in answer to my claim that
prisons should be open to sudden inspection
“without any reticences” and “without vic-
timisation,” that “both these conditions
obtain.” In the next sentence he mentions
that there are a few reticences “in the inter-
ests of the prisoners” ; and on the victimi-
sation issue he is silent. His general argu-
ments for inaction are precisely those which
confronted John Howard about 14 centuries
ago—that the governors are kind and high-
principled men; that the prisons are far
better than they used to be; that respectable
ex-prisoners have nothing to say against
them; and that the real enemies of the con-
victs are Prison Reform leagues. In one
respect alone is it possible to pin him down:
In the opinion of the undersigned the N. S. Wales
system is the best in the British Empire.
It would want to be. During the war a man
under me—or rather a boy : he was only 23
—got married and overstayed his leave. He
was the best type of Great Public school-
boy (Melbourne), and had two brothers
serving. No question of avoiding service
came into the matter, as he was not due to
go back to France for nearly six weeks. A
fool court-martial gave him the usual bar-
barous sentence, and he left for Wandsworth
Gaol. When lie returned I literally didn’t
know him. He had gone away a high-
spirited, fine-looking youngster weighing. I
should judge, about list. 71b. He walked
into the orderly-room a shifty wreck of per-
haps 9st. 71b. —certainly not more. It is
needless to detail here the story he told me
of his experiences—l found, as time went
on, that every convicted soldier had much
the same story to tell —but will content my-
self with touching on one point. When he
arrived in his cell at Wandsworth he asked
for something, lie was immediately knocked
down. Afterwards if at any time he spoke
without being addressed, or if lie complained, lie
was treated in the same way—always assum-
ing there was no high official present. After
three days he exercised his right of inter-
viewing, first, the C. of E. chaplain and
then the governor (both of whom disbelieved
him, the “warders concerned being men of
the highest integrity”), and that was how
he came to return to his unit a nerve-
racked shadow of his old self. I don’t say
this is a typical case. He was just the sort
of lad who was not fitted to take kindly to a
prison life in which inevitably _ favor goes
by cringing. What I do say is that the
opportunities for such infamies exist here,
as they did in England during the war, and
that they require to be removed. I don’t be-
lieve that discipline—genuine discipline—
would be in the slightest affected if members
of the Prison Reform or any other league
had the freedom of our prisons. In 1797 the
sailors of the R.N. were told that their
discipline would be affected disastrously if
they declined to go on eating rotten meat:
in 1917 the soldiers of the A.I.F. were assured
that their discipline would be affected disas-
trously if the death-penalty wasn’t intro-
duced for shell-shock. More cant and non-
sense have been talked about discipline than
about politics, or even religion. If our gaol
system has nothing to hide it should wel-
come the scrutiny of those who at present
suspect it; till it shows a disposition to do
so it will continue to need the apologetics of
people like “J.H.M.A.” —Yours, 2nd Divvy.
Railways, “Rural Credits” and Sundry
Swindles,
A controversy is in progress over the ever-
troubled N. S. Wales railways. The deficit
promises to-be worse than usual, despite the
fact that freights have been pushed up in
quite a breezy fashion during recent years.
It would occupy too much space to show the
increase in detail, but a comparison of a few
figures from the Commonwealth Year
Book (No. S) for 1914 and from the similar
volume (No. 15) for 1922 suggests that
somebody has a grievance :
Some N.S.W. Rati, way Rates.
1914. 1921.

Highest-class freight, per ton (50 miles) 23 0 39 2
Lowest-class freight, per ton (50 miles) 2 0 5 0
The man “on the land” says the position lias
become nearly desperate, and people who
try to collect money from him are liable to
get corroborative evidence that he is
telling the truth. It is the fashion of
the moment to vaguely advocate “a com-
prehensive system of rural credits” ; but there
is, by compulsion, a staggering and almost
unbelievable amount of rural credit already,
many agriculturists getting three and four
year's’ grace for the sufficient l’eason that it
is impossible to draw blood out of a stone,
and then they are as much in need of grace
as ever. The farmers’ complaint, though
they are not good at putting it in words, is
that thev have to pay higher wages than in
1914, much higher taxes and a much higher
railway freight per mile ; also, that they have
to pay the higher freight on the average over
a great many extra miles, because they have
been beguiled further and further out, where
the drought is worse. When it is mentioned
that the average number of miles of haulage
that everv ton of wheat had to pay for
was 1114 in 1901, 1884 in 1918 and 254 in
1921, the extent to which the swindled agri-
culturist lias been led into the wilderness and
deserted there with the crows for company
can be appreciated. The most conspicuous
reason for the disastrous increase in charges

The Prison Reform Movement.
Grant Hervey speaks from experience:—
Mr. J. H. M. Abbott is a very fine Australian
writer; all of his books, from “Trooper Tommy
Cornstalk” onwards, I have read with great plea-
sure. But the fact that Mr. Abbott once spent
five days in Pentonville in England, and lias visited
Pentridge and sundry other penitentiaries in Aus-
tralia, does not at all make him a safe authority
upon the prison system of N.S.W. That system may,
as Mr. Abbott says, be “the best in the British
Empire.” I care nothing about that. Having spent
some three-and-a-half years inside its walls, not as
a visiting journalist, but by compulsion, and unjustly,
I simply say that the system is a disgrace to Aus-
tralia, and calls for drastic reform.
There is no note of personal complaint in thrt
statement. Personally, 1 was very well treated in
Goulburn Gaol. Comptroller-General Sam McCauley,
who knew that I could write and who was a shrewd
diplomat in his way, gave me practically everything
that I ever asked for- —-and I asked for a lot. But
the fact that I fared well in prison, because I had
a “pull” with the man at the top, could not and
cannot close my eyes to the fact that the average
man in prison, in this State, fares very badly—
far more so than in Maoriland, South Australia or
Victoria. I have visited the principal prisons in
those States, and therefore I know. What is wrong
with our local system is that it simply lies beneath
the shadow of Captain Neitenstein. That man,
per mile, as well as for the number of miles
charged for, is that some 2300 miles of new
railway, most of it leading to some unpro-
gressive hamlet, have been built since the be-
ginning of the century; that most of it is
worked at a loss (hardly a scrap of railway
built within the past 20 years produces any-
thing save loss) ; and that somebody must
pay. This crazy result is the work of many
people—politicians and others with a parrot
cry about “opening up the country”; poli-
ticians with the solitary inspiration that the
distribution of loan money buys votes ; rival
politicians who are willing to spend more
loan money to buy the votes away from the
first lot; One Big City boomsters who recog-
nise that the loan money drifts to the One
Big City in the end, and makes a joyous
racket in suburban allotments; popularity-
hunters who want to “absorb the unem-
ployed” by putting them to unprofitable jobs
that presently peter out and leave them un-
employed again and in need of more jobs;
the unskilled unemployed who demand to be
“absorbed”; land-speculators, company-float-
ers and sundries. The impasse just now is
that the Department would like higher rates
because, with the present ones, it can’t pay
its way, while its country customers de-
mand lower ones, because those now prevail-
ing, added to their other burdens, threaten
to extinguish them. One nostrum is that
the Department should be relieved of its pre-
sent shortage, and of the greater one which
reduced charges would create, by “the Govern-
ment paying the loss on developmental lines”
—the ones that never develop. As the Gov-
ernment is the people, and the people pay
now, this can only mean that the accounts
should be “cooked” in some fashion to dis-
guise the situation. And there is always the
idea of the State, establishing some sort of
institution with borrowed capital to grant
“rural credits.” These and other schemes
are popular because they are easy. But they
are futile. The things that alone will save
the situation are not so easy now; and the
longer they are deferred the less easy they
will be. First, the sinful waste on new lines
and “duplications” of old ones must stop.
The appalling waste in the running of exist-
ing railways must stop likewise. And,
whether the change suits Sydney’s immediate
purposes or not, traffic must be encouraged
to proceed by the shortest practicable route.
No nostrums can take the place of those essen-
tials.

A Drey fused Digger.
This ease calls to the new Minister
I have a mate who was the victim of mistaken
identity in France, tie was arrested by gendarmes
while he was A.W.L. from a convalescent camp
about Armistice time. A charge of assaulting and
robbing an estaminet keeper was preferred against
him before a field general court-martial. Uncorro-
borated evidence was given by the estaminet keeper,
who, at first very hesitatingly, had said he identified
the Digger. The Court sentenced the accused to 10
years’ penal servitude. The prisoner, after trans-
portation back to Australia, was held as a civil
felon convicted of a civil crime. He did not have
extended to him the Peace amnesty, which granted
release on July 19, 1919, to all military prisoners.
Repeated appeals for a re trial made during 1920
by friends and by the Returned Soldiers’ Associa-
tions were answered with remissions of six years
from his sentence. The prisoner protested his inno-
cence all along, therefore no appeal for a pardon
had been made. The appeals made to the Minister
for Defence had been for a civil review of the pro-
ceedings of the court-martial. Senator Pearce refused
to supply either the Queensland Crown Law Depart-
ment or the R.S. and S.I.L.A. with a copy of the
court-martial notes of evidence.
The prisoner was released in September, 1920.
He was presented then with a “disgrace” discharge,
was denied pension, badge, uniform, leave-gratuity
and blood money. His widowed mother, mourning
the death of another soldier son, was deprived of
his pay allotment for the term df the incarceration.
He still suffers the stigma of a crime he did not
commit. He bore, pre-war, a good naffte as a steady,
homely, honest, back-country lad. He had been
employed in one job for six years, right ftp to his
enlistment in 1915. His war" service was not un-
worthy that of any of his mates in his battalion.
He had participated in every valorous stunt of the
famous 9th during the final two years of the war.
He could have proved an alibi before the F.G.C.M.
if he had betrayed to the provost-marshal some
mates who were A.W.L. with him, and had subpmnacd
a French proprietress of another estaminet who had
contravened martial law by harboring him.
The exigencies of warfare perhaps necessitated my
mate’s conviction upon the scanty evidence produced
by the French gendarmerie. But now, in the
saner time of peace, it is surely fitting that this
Digger should be granted a civil revision of the
court-martial trial and a hearing for his new evi-
dence in defence. He was treated as a civil crimi-
nal ; therefore, he should have a civil criminal’s right
to be tried before a civil judge and jury. The Com-
monwealth Solicitor-General lias advised the Defence
Department that there was sufficient evidence to
warrant the conviction by the court-martial, because
the president of the • court had accepted the credi-
bility of the French witness. But one of Australia’s
most learned counsel, to whom I was privileged to
present the salient features of the case, said that,
if he were trying the accused upon the court-martial
notes, he would say to the jury “The evidence is
sufficient but not satisfactory."
SUB JUDICE.
“The N.S.W. executive of the A.L.P. has ruled that the expulsion of Parliamentary Labor-leader Dooley
is sub judice, and has therefore forbidden branches and members to discuss it on pain of expulsion.”
THE CHUCKER-OUT : “Drown, will he? Well, I can’t help that. He’s sub judice, and
anybody who throws him a life-line will be sub judice too.”
whom Mr. Abbott lauds as an efficient Comptroller-
General, was entirely representative of the spirit
of the early convict days. He, when challenged,
notably by “Burglar Bill” in The Bulletin, did
exactly what Minister for Justice T. J. Ley now
does —asserted that the system was a model system,
and could not be changed. But the fact stands that
a change came. And that change will go on. Men
like Mr. T. J. Ley have no official grip on eternity.
There is a slow’, sure tide of practical reform that
rises, beneath them, in spite of all their Ministerial
protests, and sweeps them out of the way.
NeiteXsTein is dead. And it is a good job,
McCauley ajid Darcy, his two long-term successors,
are also dead, and that too is a good job, because
they learnt th<Sr business as gaolers under the
official shadow of NeiTienstein. But ex-Police
Magistrate W. M. MacF’arlane, who was jockeyed
out of the Comptroller-Generalship by a most dis-
creditable political trick, is still alive; and I
nominate him as the right man to conduct a public
inquiry into the working of the prison system of
N. S. Wales.
The present Comptroller-General, Mr. William
Urquhart, is a man for whom I entertain the most
cordial feelings of regard. I knew him first, officially,
as governor of Goulburn Gaol. Often he would
drop into my cell —No. 48 in B Wing—to borrow
a book or two of mine; and for my part, whenever
I went to Governor Urquhart, on behalf of some
weak and friendless prisoner who was in trouble, or
who wanted a pair of boots or a decent suit to go
out of gaol in, I always got what was wanted.
But the plain fact is that not even the virtues of
50 good Comptrollers-General could cover the faults
in a system that is so utterly out of date. The
Department of Justice itself, let alone the prison
system, is covered with the barnacles of a prehistoric
Georgianism, and requires most searching treatment.
Mr. T. J. Ley can bounce and bluff, officially, as
much as he likes. But the blunt and brutal truth
is that men can be done to death in gaol in N. S.
Wales. And on the day that a proper Commission
of Inquiry is appointed I shall be 'on hand to describe
how one such poor wretch was killed—murdered
would be the right word for it —in Goulburn Gaol.
Mr. Abbott says, in conclusion, that “if Mr. Ley,
the present Minister, does not allow himself to be
influenced too much by the Prison Reform Society,
he will deserve the ultimate thanks of the whole
community, both ‘inside’ and out.” That is plain
bosh. The principal witnesses put forward by the
society, when their deputation waited on Mr. Ley,
told nothing but the truth. I allude to the witnesses
Finn and Butler, both of whom I personally knew
in Goulburn Goal. Finn was one of the best con-
ducted men I knew in the prison. As for Butler,
what was done to him, by way of dark-cell treat-
ment, for a very trivial offence, was so fiendish that
it converted a young man in his early thirties into
a tottering wreck, apparently of 60, upon the verge
of the grave. I never shall forget the day when I
first saw that poor fellow creep out of B Wing- into
the exercise yard. It made my very soul, let alone
my blood, go cold.
The prison system of this State is stupid, and
lacks a scientific base. Thanks to the operation
of that viciously out-of-date system, for the past
50 years N.S.W. has flooded the world with expert
crooks. I am not a crook. I am a plain man
who went to gaol in others’ stead. I volunteered
in prison in 1915, and offered to serve in any capa-
city at the war. A stupidly malicious system of
justice, although Me Cal’lev w r as willing, refused me
my chance to go. Now’, again, in the public interest,
I volunteer to be of some service to the State, in
regard to this question of prison reform. And, with
great deference to Mr. T. J. Ley and his apologist,
Mr. Abbott, I will be heard.
Dear Bulletin, —I am sick even unto death
and the grave of this Town-Planning sham, or
Town-Slmmming plan, that we hear so much
of in Sydney. I have just read that the
Planners held their annual bean-feast the
other night—the tenth, I think, for the con-
cern is getting into years, and expects to have
its centenary at any moment. The report
stated that “from small beginnings the T.P.A.
has become a force to be reckoned with.”
I am glad the Planners have such a good
opinion of themselves, but what has the force
done? If John Sulman and his friends
have been town-planning so long, where on
earth is the town that John and his friends
have planned? Alternatively, where is their
Flan-town going to be, if it isn’t anywhere
yetii Australia has hardly established one
new town in 50 years, save a few ephemeral
mining places which established themselves,
and, like Oqolgardie and Silverton, are pre-
pared to disestablish again. It has not
established ore gew State, and consequently
not one new State capital, in the same time.
In fact, it has hardly established anything
except suburbs since it set up for itself,
unless the association is thinking of Can-
berra, and ’Berra is unreal. It suggests
Rotorua, barring the hot springs, and the
red lake, and the blue lake, and the green
lake, and the brown girls, and the smoking
mountain, and the presence of a main line
of railway, and the fact that Rotorua keeps
going all the year round, instead of being
deserted when Parliament is not sitting.
With its “hostel” to accommodate 100 hy-
dropathic legislators, and its “refectory,” and
its lawns on which invalid lawmakers may
repose, the place should be the real convales-
cents’ home. With a little more originality
the Planners might throw themselves into
the New States movement, for that wou.d
involve the creation of more capitals, but
being city birds of an olden schood they pre-
fer to patch, in their minds, the old place
which is so badly Planned already. I am
going to take a leaf out of their book, and
found a Theoretical Whale-Fishing Society
at I)ubbo. —Yours,
J. E.
This comes from Cloncurry:—
The fatuous comments of the N.S.W. Fullers
when 1061 persons put in for a grazing area or
1160 acres near Armidale (B. iy2/’2S) have a
familiar ring in Queensland. For two blocks on
the Great Northern Railway, one of 16,394 acres
and the other of 16,167 acres, there were 1673
applicants. If the Fuller argument holds good the
1671 losers are disappointed land-seekers. Dis-
appointed they are certainly, as these two blocks are in
first-class sheep-country and in the neighborhood of
a rising township. In short, one of them would
be like a first prize in Tatt.’s. But the land seeking is
mostly a myth. In an adjoining district there are
between 40 and 50 idle selections, about half of
them within a 70-mile radius of Cloncurry town-
ship. The selections were resumed from pastoral
leases and thrown open, but many were never taken
up. Others were abandoned after a brief struggle.
Nevertheless, Theodore still harbors the fantasythat the
Queenslanders are land-starved, and pastoral leases are
being resumed at a brisk rate, although not 20
per cent, of the earth resumed is suitable for the
small man or likely to be selected. If resumed
land is not selected within a certain period, the
holder of a pastoral lease may obtain it by occu-
pation license, but as this can be taken from him
after three months’ notice, if anyone desires to select
it (strangers are occasionally tempted—usually to
their sorrow), and as no compensation is allowed
for improvements made during the 0.1. period,
licenses are not in demand. Hence, land that could
be worked in larger holdings, but is useless in small
selections, lies idle, or is held and not improved;
and often existing improvements through want of
attention are undergoing the back-to-nature pro-
cess. But, of course, money lost in rent and in
the cost of surveying land useless for selection
is immaterial to a Government that achieved a deficit
of £342,000 on its bullock ranches in one year.

“Country I"ed” : Daily am I haunted by
the spectacle of a small boy sitting in his
little desk in front of me. He has been
coming to school for over two years now —
he started at the wrong age of four-and-a-
half—and he is now hardly any. further
advanced than when he began, while other
children, who started a year later, are read-
ing fluently and counting readily. Studying
this boy closely to discover the reason for
this great disparity, I came to the conclu-
sion that his eyes needed attention, and
suggested this to his father. The parents
refused to entertain the Idea, and so there
the child has to stick. Now, if there were
medical inspection of schools throughout the
State, such a case would be attended to
properly. The Vic. Education Department
employs four medical-officers and runs a
dental clinic in Melbourne, all for Melbourne
school children only. The country children
have to do without. This is not the Depart-
ment’s fault; the blame primarily rests with
the Government, which refuses to sanction
increased expenditure and the extra appoint-
ments. But even with the present meagre
medical staff, surely the country children
are entitled to the attention of half of them.
Their parents pay their share of the taxes.
A visit to a school once every three years
would be sufficient for a start, just to jolt
the parents into a sense of their responsi-
bilities. Teachers well know how little
parents regard their advice as to the medi-
cal attention that children require, but a
report from a doctor is quite a different
thing, and in many cases that is all that is
needed.
«
Melbourne Age, which tried to prevent the
Bruce-Page alliance, and was very sore-
headed about it for weeks, handsomely
admitted the other day that the Ministry had
made “a very promising beginning." That
is the general verdict, in spite of Bruces
spats. Old Parliamentary hands agree that
the Government emerged creditably 7 from
its baptism of fire, and comment approvingly
on its tolerance of criticism and its readi-
ness to supply information that couldn’t be
dragged from Hughes. By others it is noted
that the political atmosphere has become
healthier and less provocative and more con-
ducive to the performance of useful work.
The danger is that the new men will try to
do too many things at once. Financial re-
form ought to be their main consideration
during the coming session. The tuppenny-
ha’penny matters can wait.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Feeling in high feather as a result of the
Rockhampton (Q.) by-election and Labor
Convention, Theodore has decided to go to
the country on May 12 instead of the middle
of October. He expects that the ill-feeling
among the Gnashers and Cookies will enable
him to scrape back with a majority of two,
BEYOND HOPE OR FEAR.
“A meeting of unemployed will be held in the
Domain to discuss Dooley v. McGirr."
“ Ain't there nothin' in the world had enough
to worry you, Dan?”
"No, nothin' —I don't even care if it's Dooley
an' it’ll he all the same if it’s McGirr.”
perhaps four. And it may work out that
way. On the other hand, the country may,
and probably will, prefer to take a chance
with the crowd in Opposition, for all their
disunion and plethora of obscure leaders.
Such things happen in the political game,
especially when the mob on the Treasury
henches has been there for eight years.
Between hangings in Ireland various
people have discovered various masses ot
correspondence and other high explosn es.
One letter purported to be the copy of a mes-
sage sent from De Valera to J. J. O’Kelly in
U.S.A., telling him that lie ought to be
ashamed of the progress he wasn't making
in the States, and indicating that if he and
Father O’Flanagan went on to Australia
things might settle down a bit in America.
The interesting pair have since turned up in
Melbourne, and propose to get to work it
the Australian Government will let them.
They announce that they have arrived w.th
a message of peace in one hand and the
truth in the other. Incidentally, the last
Sinn Fein ambassador that visited these
parts wasn’t allowed to land. Also, ms
ancestral home was recently burnt dowm by
his grateful countrymen.
South Aus. should have had two Nation-
alist Senators at the December election ; in-
stead, it got three Laborites. Now the
defeated party is asking why, and is mostly
getting two answers— 11ughes and Harwell.
The former has paid for his share; the latter
may have to pay. There isn’t much the
matter with the State Premier except that
lie is impulsive. He needs always a Walling-
ton alongside him to say “Better not!’ His
outburst over the colored-labor question was
a case of the man speaking before he was
ready; and that was only one instance ot
many.
“Pipards” finds another flaw:—
Is there anything move ludicrously unconstitutional
in the Commonwealth Constitution than the spectacle
of men sitting and voting in the Senate after they
have been rejected at the polls t Take the case of
Henderson, ltuzacott and lie Largie, of W.A., who
after being contemptuously repudiated by a huge
majority of State electors last December returned to
Melbourne to pose as senators for another six months.
They have no constituency to represent, they are
responsible to nobody, and after the deafening finality
with which they were informed they were no longer
wanted, their feelings towards a State in which none
of them have lived for years are likely to be com-
pounded more of blank indifference, if not resentment,
than gratitude. It may be argued that in a brief
opening session the discards and rejects ot the polls
have very little chance to be a harmful influence, but
this may r.ot be always so. That defeated laudi-
dates, annihilated ones in this ease, should be suffered
to remain in Parliament for however limited a
period, and keep elected ones out, is surely the
dean limit in grotesqueness.
Where the A.L.P. gets its orders: —
Despite its arrogance, the A.L.P. is by no means
supreme in the Labor hierarchy, in 1921 the All-
Australian Trade Union Congress adopted the present
socialisation objective. But at the succeeding A.L.P.
conference many of the leaders had their doubts
about it, and its chances began to look like those
of Buckley. At that stage enter A. C. Willis, secre-
tary of the Council of Action appointed by the
Congress. Very bland was Mr. Willis, admitting
that he had no credentials, and was much obliged
to the Conference for permitting him to speak. What
he had to say was that he and Mr. Bacldeley were
there under instructions from the All-Australian
Congress to see that its decisions were properly
interpreted and understood. Mr. Willis desired
above all things harmony, .by which he meant the
harmony that would ensue if the Conference swal-
lowed holus-bolus what the Congress had prescribed.
But if the objective was turned down, another All-
Australian Congress would be called at once, and
“the industrial organisations would- certainly move.”
The Willis nod was as good as a wink to the. Con-
ference, which accepted the objective with little
more ado. Nothing but holy terror of the Industrial-
ists, represented by the All-Australian Congress,
pushed the objective through, both at the inter-State
conference of the A.L.P. and at the N. S. Wales
conference last June, when it was opposed by such
lights of “the movement” as “Jupp” Gardiner, Dunn
(deputy leader of the N.S.W. party, who said it
would keep Labor out of office for 50 years) and
Power (head of the State A.L.P. and chief thrower-
out in the present expulsion policy).
In Queensland the amalgamated Nation-
alist-Country party promises to abolish
the Golden Casket and other public
gambles, to allow certainly not more
than six pony meetings daily, to permit
new settlers to acquire the freehold if they
desire, the pure leasehold having fallen almost
as flat as in the N. Territory, and to make
State electorates as nearly as possible hold
the same number of voters, just as Federal
electorates do. Considering that ia 1920
it took G 345 votes to elect Oppositionist
Baines, while 6522 votes sufficed to elect
■five Ministerialists, owing to their uncanny
knack of pegging out pocket boroughs for
themselves, it is manifest that any equal-
distribution scheme would hit the Boys of
the Old Brigade pretty hard. Theodore, who
owns the second smallest constituency of the
lot, was one of the five lucky dwarfs.
An hour or two after his nomination as
leader of the N.S.W. Labor party, the fizzy
McGirr leaped into the limelight with the
“policy” of his future Government. Dooley
was still the leader elected by the party in
Parliament, and recognised by the Speaker,
who doesn’t know the A.L.P. executive from
a blue giraffe. He was in possession of the
Opposition-leader’s room, and, until deposed
by caucus, was in a position to have McGirr
removed from it by force if he refused to go
otherwise. The question of the validity of
Dooley’s expulsion, and also of McGirr’s own
appointment, may take a heap of argument
yet. Still, McGirr may be out again, walk-
ing the same plank as Dooley and many
more, before Parliament meets —especially
if he so far forgets his humble station as to
prance round issuing “policies,” in forget-
fulness of the fact that Laborites get their
“policies” ready-made.
Yic. Public Service, through its union, is
trying to have three commissioners appointed
to control it, instead of one. The com-
plaint is that the Cabinet sub-committee on
Service matters has so overshadowed retir-
ing-commissioner Morrison that his occupa-
tion has practically gone. This Treasurer
McPherson will not admit, but he has
promised to consider the triumvirate sugges-
tion. It is becoming clearer that if State
Government employees are not to have
Commonwealth arbitration they must have
classification or work-assessment boards.
The alternative is trouble.
A DANGEROUS LOCALITY,
“There is now one. Government employee to every 12 of our
adult population. At the last seven years’ rate of increase, ii 20
years’ time there will be one in five.”
CLARENCE: “ Don't you .sec, Herbert, if ire stay in Aus-
tralia the effluxion of time or somethin' trill make
us take a job under Gov’ment, whether we like it
or not?”
People in Joe Cook’s old district outside
Parramatta (N.S.W. » are just learning the
blessings of building unwanted railways to
give somebody a job at election lime, and
then flooding the whole system with men
who don’t earn half their tucker. The dis-
trict for years has had a steam tram, but
this was superseded by a railway, and now
people who used to pay gd. have to pay
9d. (2nd), or Is. Id. (Ist), and the trains
don’t run half as often.
Even the Judges are beginning to peer
suspiciously at solitary confinement, as wit-
ness a happening at last Darlinghurst (Syd-
ney) Quarter Sessions. Here the Judge,
after sentencing a man to two years, reduced
the term with the express object of eliminat-
ing the three months’ dose of solitary con-
finement. If only one Judge is satisfied it
is so useless (or worse) that a well-merited
sentence is worth cutting down in order to
avoid it, then there must be a powerful case
against it from the standpoint of the com-
mon or garden citizen. The Bench, despite
its high mental level, always sees these
things last or thereabouts. It is trained that
way.
“Didymus”: Those cabled reports that
there is to be a bargain sale in England
of Australian ships, towing a deficit of about
£8,000,000, set me thinking about the flat-
tering tales poured into willing ears by
Hughes at the recent elections. lie said
that his shipping policy had given Australia
"a fleet for nothing,” because the Common-
wealth line had not only paid for itself, but,
after wiping _ out the loss on wooden
ships (£2,015,513), showed a net profit of
£4,826,306. Yet one remembers that the
canny Bruce, in his financial statement last
August, declined to put on his credit side
any sum for the surplus earnings of the Com-
monwealth Line. His reason was that,
although the line had shown a surplus, “a
study of the balance-sheet is necessary in
order to arrive at a true appreciation of the
position.” In other words, what might
do for the supposedly long-eared public
wasn’t good enough for Bruce.
The detection or otherwise of breaches of
the Vic. licensing law is no longer to be the
prerogative of a score of J. Hops in Mel-
bourne and suburbs. Following upon the
passage of the new Act, which has given the
Pubs Reduction Board more power, the
police squad which used to prowl in Bung’s
neighborhood has been disbanded. A new
patrol will be picked from the force, but
it will be “constantly changed.” Which
suggests—well, it suggests that Mr. Pintpot
will have to watch his step.
Henry Bateson’s M.D. grievance:—
For a country that pays something like £ 50,000
in mail subsidies to shipping companies M.L. gets
a poor deal. Recently a steamer left Sydney for
Auckland on a Friday, and another left for Wel-
lington a day later. All the mail for the South was
dumped aboard the northern boat, so that the Wel-
lington portion reached the capital a couple of days
after the direct boat had arrived. The Sydney officials
have frequently been known to dump all the mails
on one boat because she leaves a couple of hours
before the other. They forget or don’t know that
500-odd miles separate Auckland and Wellington,
and that the two cities are linked together by a
slow and inefficient railway. Or perhaps they just
don’t care a hang.
McGirr, the gentleman who dangled
motherhood millions before
the N.S.W. electors’ noses a
few months ago, hadn’t been
nominated as leader of the
Labor party more than an
hour or two before he dis-
covered other ways of spend-
ing borrowed millions. Hav-
ing been told that there are
£<>0,600,000 on deposit in
the State Savings Bank, he
proposed to lend it out to
“homeseekers” at 44 per
cent., allowing each "seek-
er” 95 per cent, of the cost
of his land and house. The
cost of both would doubtless
rise amazingly if the scheme
was done on the scale
Gregory foreshadowed, for
in the rush a land, brick
and labor famine would set
in. Then, if the £BOO home
depreciated to £7OO, tin*
nominal owner would have
no further interest in it, the
£7GO being all mortgage, aud
he would tend to vanish.
And it might depreciate to
£7OO or less. It is impos-
sible to build lots of houses
at house-famine prices, and
thus cure the house-famine
as Gregory the Great pro-
mises to do, without destroy-
ing the house-famine values
which would be the security
for Gregory’s loans. How-
ever, as a matter of fact, the
funds are not there for the
proposed debauch, for tin 1
►Savings Bank moneys are
lent out already, mostly to
the N.S.W. Government.
But though McGirr was
part of the Government for
two years he can’t be expected to know that.
“Bildad”: Every candidate for Parlia-
ment, in addition to showing that he is a
qualified voter, which doesn’t really matter
much, should produce a certificate showing
that he has passed a stiff examination m
certain subjects, including political economy.
The object would, of course, be to prevent
performing monkeys or other accidents get-
ting at the Treasury, being sent there by
people who mean well, but are no more quali-
fied to make a man a statesman by looking
him over than to make him a surgeon. And
if a politician, especially one who is in the
running for office, deliberately proposed to
lend f()0,000,000 of the people’s money at
nominal interest on dashed bad security, I
would make it competent for any elector
who held the Possible Candidate’s Certificate
or diploma to require some competent
authority to cancel the babbler’s ticket unless
he made a satisfactory defence. I wouldn’t
dream of disqualifying anybody for transient
peevishness with a crowd *of “uncouth
crooks” with little education and few man-
ners except bad ones. But the fellow who
wants to drive the State car at top speed on
both sides of the road at once, whether out
of ignorance (which is bad) or grotesque
flashness (which is awful), should be struck
off the roll as a public danger.
It is just on two years since the bosses of
the Australian unions struck their latest
10s. levy for the Sydney Labor daily that
was to have arrived in 1914. They "talked
with engaging confidence of raising £220.000,
and therewith issuing not only the long-
promised World —for which a £1 head-tax
was exacted 10 years ago from shearers as
remote as Gascoyne (W.A.) —but “a chain
of Labor dailies in all the capitals.” Actu-
ally, £29,330 Gs. Bd. has been dragged in
by moral suasion, pure reason and the argu-
ment of the boot. And the cost of collec-
tion, instead of amounting to a few pounds
for postage and exchange on cheques, has
galloped away with £4491 2s. Gd., roughly 15
p.c. The average unionist is already a com-
pulsory subscriber to various weekly papers,
and plainly the prospect of having' to swal-
low Communist hog wash six times oftener
doesn’t appeal to him.
THE OLD MAN PAYS HIS DEBTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“President Harding has affixed his signature to the
Act accepting Britain’s arrangements for wiping
out its debt (4,600,000,000 dollars) to the U.S.A.”
Upon his' shoulders Father John
A giant’s load has laid.
Six decades will have come and gone
Before the thing is paid.
The cruel blows he got from Fritz
Still show upon his face;
His “workless workshops, idle pits,
Are mute appeals for grace;
But, steadfast in his utmost need,
All else old Dad forgets
But this, his immemorial creed —
Stern slogan of a stubborn breed —
“A man must pay his debts.”
In storm and calm—-when bloody strife
The stricken earth enfolds
And in the small concerns of life —
The clean tradition holds.
Our fluent ruffians of the Left
Would cure a world’s malaise
With One Big Panacea —theft.
Bull walks his ancient ways.
A dolt in that regard is Dad,
Assert Moskowa’s pets.
His dearth of intellect is sad....
Stiff-necked, thick-headed, hopeless, mad,
Yes—but he pays his debts.
Let slant-eyed Tartars whine for alms
To those from whom they steal :
Let Huns deny, with lifted palms,
The wealth that they conceal;
Let slick State Premiers once a year
To London speed, and shove
Their teeth in Dad’s devoted ear
To show their filial love.
Though cadgers come from every coast,
He never fumes or frets,
But, firm among a feckless host,
Fulfils his people’s proud old boast—
The English pay their debts.

Revenue and the outgo under the heading of
claims are both expanded by the bonus dis-
tribution in respect of the previous year.
Claims include £118,638, which constituents
had the right to draw in cold cash; they
took only £3935, less than 3J p.c., and showed
their faitli in the City Mutual by leaving the
balance (£114,693) to buy additional assur-
ance. Other sources of income were: re-
newal premiums, £291,719; premiums from
policies written during the year, £76,967;
annuities, £1260; interest, rents and profits
from sales of securities, £157,603. These
items totted up £641,593, which was almost
four times the society’s figures of only 10
years back, when it had been in business 34
years. So favorable have conditions been
lately that the surplus for the past 12 months
was larger than the total income of only four
years ago. The City Mutual’s rapid expan-
sion has not been effected by participation
in the wild scramble for policies which the
numerous young offices started. “Safety, not
size, has always been the City Mutual’s
aim,” says managing-director Geo. Crowley ;
but new business has flowed in heavily since
the war and ’flu taught many people the
lesson of life-assurance, and since more ex-
pensive living induced old policy-holders to
increase their coyer. Here are some City
Mutual figures:—

1922 .. .. 291,719 76,967 2,194,076
The feature of the latest new-business was
rhat a larger volume of assurance was con-
tracted for in the 5503 policies issued than in
6008 for the previous year, the average
assurance per policy having increased from
£361 to almost £4OO.
Not including with revenue the cash
bonuses applied to the purchase of reversion-
ary bonuses —this necessitated only book
entries —all-in expenses took 15.4 p.c. of in-
come. That cast rate was a little less than
for the previous year, and a big improvement
on pre-war days. The volume of new busi-
ness, however, has a big bearing on costs in
a life office: all the preliminaries necessary
to rope in new policy-holders—canvassing
commissions, medical fees, etc. —swell costs,
and the size of new business in relation to
, old is an important factor in any year’s
expense sheets. What precisely is the cost
of the City Mutual’s new business cannot be
definitely determined, but by applying The
Bulletin’s formula of allowing 7 p.c. of
renewal premiums (3 p.c. for annuities) as
the cost of old business, and charging the
balance of exes, against new business, last
year £76,067 of first premiums were got at a
post of £60,000-odd, equal to 78 p.c. Calcu-
lated in the same way, new business costs
have been lower in other years, but the figures
are still much smaller than those of many big
competitors, and less than half what some of
the young offices are paying. One factor
which has elevated the City Mutual’s latest
new business cost is that, th nigh a larger
volume of assurances was put on the books
last year, first premiums were £11,500
smaller. Anyway, the performance was very
creditable, particularly as the management
selects its risks and probably spends some-
thing on proposals it finally decides to reject.
That the City Mutual business is of good
quality is illustrated by this comparison of
losses by death : —■
1915 . . £36,451 1919 , . £43,973
i&J(S . . 30,801 1920 . . 34,692
1917 , . 61,333 1921 . . 47,034
1918 ~ 55,534 1922 . . . 50,284
Last year’s losses were only £13,833 larger
than in 1915, though 11 millions or so new
assurances —some straight-out endowments, of
course—have since gone on the books. Dur-
ing the past 12 months £11,049 less was paid
away in death-claims than during the
third year of war. The City Mutual’s losses
are much lighter than is allowed for in its
premium charges. That is one important
source of distributable surplus. Costs lower
than provisions in the premiums is another
source. Still another is the excess of earn-
ings from investments over and above what
had been reckoned on. All three factors are
operating in policy-holders’ favor in the City
Mutual, and particularly the income from in-
vestments. The management has consider-
ably more than half its total assets in mort-
gages, which, of course, give a higher return
than the gilt-edged stocks into which the
bulk of assurance funds go nowadays. So
long as these loans are granted on sound pro-
positions and conservative valuations, and are
protected by ample margins, there’s nothing-
wrong with this class of investment, particu-
larly as there is a surplus of Government
securities, debentures and cash amounting to
£530,000 in excess of all liabilities. That,
apart from current income, covers more than
twice the latest claims outgo. This shows
how balance-sheet groups have expanded in
nine years:—

Cash & sundries . . 44,737 6.2" 80,495 3.5
£717,110 £2,303,580
Last year was an exceptionally good one in
the securities section: the £157,003 receipts
gave 7f p.c. on average funds, but an un-
specified amount of profit from sales of assets
contributed to that very high return.
The £322,560 surplus shown in the introduc-
tory table is not distributable piofit. It is
the excess of income over and above all out-
goings, and from it the actuary has to ex-
tract the amount necessary to provide for the
additional liability which has accrued under
policies during the accounting period. At the
1921 balance, when £281,219 underwriting sur-
plus was left after writing-off £II,4KM, actuary
Diamond, who made his p >licy valuations on
the basis that funds would produce only 84
p.c. p.a. interest in future, found £190,000 of
Surplus not required in- his department. The
directors took only £118,628, and that pro-
vided bonuses which, they claim, are "the
largest paid by any life office in the British
Empire.” During the past five years the
City Mutual has collected slightly more than
two millions of income and paid £461,000 in
bonuses.

Profits for the past half are the best since
pre-war terms. The gross profit from trad-
ing, however, was only £7OO better than for
the 1921 December term, and nearly £lBOO
less than in 1920. Rents are contributing
more, but lower costs have been wholly re-
sponsible for the substantial improvement'—

Compared with early years the figures on
both sides of the bffclanee-sheet are swollen by
heavier excise duties. The directors offer
no explanation of the decline of manufac-
turing and trading expenses from £19,852
in 1920 to £17,075 last year. Evidently some-
thing besides lower wages has helped. The,
recovery of net earnings to slightly b.elow
the level of 10 years ago must be considered
in relation to new funds since put to work
in the business. Nine years ago £lO,OOO of
new capital was got in, and £25,500 of re-
serves, apart from the storage in a “depreci-
ation insurance reserve,” have accumulated.
There are now visible funds totalling £319,000
against £83,000 in 1913. Earnings are,
therefore, -relatively not nearly so good as
they formerly were. Of course, the beer
industry has been under a cloud; prohibition:
agitations have threatened its future, Gov-
ernments have made raids and imposed re-
strictions, and generally the Trade has lost
much of its pre-war glitter. Nevertheless,
the directors of this cn. have not been scared.
For years they have been steadily develop-
ing the Castlemaine Brewery’s interests, and
since December, 1915, the book value of free-
hold and leasehold properties, plant and
machinery, rolling stock, goodwill, etc., has
expanded from £111,050 to £174,875. On
the other side the depreciation insurance
reserve has moved from £18,891 to £32,091.
For three half-years shareholders were pre-
vailed upon to forego divs. so that a Fre-
mantle pub could be purchased. To pay for
extensions of the business and to carry larger
stocks and book debts the directors have de-
pended on outsiders for assistance. Seven
years ago the co. showed £lO,OOO-odd of
liq aid assets in excess of all liabilities, but
the position has altered in this way:—

Liquid assets . . £24,168 £29,162 £27,158 £20,682

Surplus assets ..£10,144 -
Excess liabilities.. 4, 3 >730 £62 £12,983
Of the £33,665 of liabilities at December 31
last £16,616 was bank overdraft and most of
the balance current trading accounts. If
assets are in good order and better earn-
ings continue, shareholders can hope for
something more than 74 p.c. when the co.’s
finances are made snug.

A few years ago this old leather-manufactur-
ing co. decided that city property was too
valuable for factory purposes. A new fac-
tory was built in the suburbs, and a couple of
storeys were added to the city premises, So that
the co. could become a landlord. In seven
years the book value of freeholds has moved
from £16,983 to £63,553; but the 10 p.c.
which was formerly paid on £56,644 of capi-
tal is still regularly maintained on £79,300.
Though there is no large margin of surplus
profit in excess of div. requirements, a little
may be going up the sleeve; in their latest
report the directors state that “due provision
has been made for depreciation in the value
of assets, bad debts and other contingencies.”
The management has always given a. close
eye to stock values, and though larger earn-
ings were disclosed dui'in" the unprecedented
boom in leather price<= a few years back,
when the market collapsed no pruning of
book values was visible in the published
accounts. The following comparisons show
balance-sheet movements since 1915: —

outlay on premises and factory : new capital
provided less than half the additional funds
required for buildings.

most likely, besides making adequate provi-
sion for upkeep of machinery and plant, the
management is allowing liberally for wastage
of assets. During the past six months a
few hundreds more have visibly gone into
plant, etc., so an examination of the liquid
position does not help to throw much light
on actual earnings. Anyway, colliery cos.
have a habit in good years of buying new
plant out of revenue and immediately
writing-off the amount involved, and as the
extent of purchases is not disclosed they
often are doing very much better than their
abbreviated published accounts indicate.
Here are some Yale of Clwydd figures which
give a general idea of how well the co. has
done

During the 10 years capital has gone from
£45,000 to £90,000 by leaps of £15,000 in
1913, 1919 and 1921. These additions were
wholly transferred profits, and 10 p.c. divs.
have been paid regularly on the larger capi-
tal, with a bit more occasionally by way
of special cash bonuses. Meanwhile, alter
renewing plant and machinery, and making
additions thereto, the surplus of assets apart
from the colliery, brickworks and their appur-
tenances over and above all liabilities has
expanded £55,467. Though there are only
£14,000 of visible reserves to help £90,000 of
paid capital, £63,696 of the share-register is
backed by investments, stores, cash and book
debts.

This little co. has been assisting Launceston
into its own home for 52 years. Altogether
it lias advanced about li million, and is still
active. Last year 118 applications for
£32,560 were accepted, and the balances due
on mortgage moved from £111,624 to
£118,023. Other assets were: War Loan
and State securities, £9147; book debts,
£1017; premises and equipment, £2070; cash,
£2442. Investors’ and borrowers’ shares
have given £55,924 of capital, in addition to
which, after payment of the final div., there
were reserves of £21,498. At December 31
the co. was working on £50,763 of deposits.
Liquid assets covered £11,589 of these de-
posits, leaving £49,000-odd to be protected
by £122,000 book value of advances and

Australian Group and General Assur-
ance Co., Ltd. (Sydney).—The boom in life-
assurance flotations continues, despite the
disillusioning of investors in numerous new
cos. A. G. Melville, who produces impressive
records of 20 years’ service with the Colonial
Mutual, introduces the co. to handle all
classes of assurance and insurance. Particu-
lar attention is to be given to group-assur-
ance, a field which has so far not been devel-
oped to any extent in the Commonwealth. The
idea is to invite co-operative effort between
employers and employees to establish funds
to provide for life assurance, superannuation,
sickness, accidents and welfare activities.
Mr. Melville introduced a scheme covering
more than 1660 employees of Marcus Clark’s
(Sydney), which is declared to be working
well. But the prospectus fails to mention
how profitable this class of business has
proved elsewhere. For the rest, the A.G.G.A.
prospects differ in no rvay from those of other
recent boats, except that the team engaged for
the preliminaries appears to have more satis-
factory qualifications and seems to appreci-
ate better the necessity of keeping down costs
and selecting risks. A novel feature of the
float is the setting aside of 25,000 ordinaries
for members of the staff who produce good
business cheaply. In this way. the manage-
ment hopes for the “rapid building of a per-
manent staff producing the cream of ‘quality’
business.”
Branches are to be opened in other States,
and the co. is faced with the usual unavoid-
able heavy costs of establishment and early
operations. The prospectus wisely makes no
rash promises of fat returns to shareholders,
but, when profits do show up. they are pro-
mised up to 12 p.c. on capital. and 20 p.c. of
the divisible surplus. To attract capital the
promoters are loading the business with heavy
div. obligations: 100,600 of the 10s. shares
offered are prefs. carrying 8 p.c. cumulative
and ranking equally with ordinaries for any-

thing above that rate. If this issue is fully
subscribed a liability of £4OOO p.a. will
accrue, and years must elapse before a first
div. distribution can become possible. This

William Adams and Co., Ltd. —When this
machinery co. presented its 1921-22 accounts
jn August last, and showed a small trading
ioss, the directors believed they had over-
come the worst troubles of the period of in-
dustrial depression and slump of prices.
Since then engineering, mining and timber
industries have not revived sufficiently to
clear stocks, and values, influenced also by
unstable exchanges, have depreciated further.
Revaluations at present market rates show
a total depreciation of £42,000, and it is
now proposed to write off this amount, plus
£3OOO of other adjustments. The 225,000 £1
fully-paid ordinary shares are to be reduced
to 16s. each. At the last balance, prior to
this revaluation of stock, reserves of £12,645
were shown, and the directors announced
that a review of properties showed them
to be Avorth £22,744 more than book values.

The Gold Producers’ Association has
issued a return shoiving that to date it has
distributed more than 34 millions of gold
premium. Westralia has received 24 mil-
liohs of it (67 p.c.), Victoria half a million
114.3 p.c.), Queensland £447,000 (12.74 p.c.)
and N. S. Wales £155,000 ( 4.43 p.c.). The
other three States have shared 1.38 p.c.
The advance in the price of tin was pre-
dicted by The Bulletin some weeks ago, on
the authority of a prominent Australian
buyer. American opinion at that time was
that there would be a rise to £270, if not
£BOO, but the Australian metal-man fixed
£250 as the maximum, with a tendency to
go back slowly to between £2OO and £225.
This expert’s predictions should be noted,
particularly by speculators, as the rise is sure
to bring forth a batch of new propositions.
With present wages and conditions, £2OO
per ton will not leave much margin of profit
even for the most favored of local shows.
N. S. Wales’s 1922 mineral production
was worth £14,274,770, and was bettered in
<-nly one other year—l9lB, £14,419,352.
The resumption of operations at Broken
Hill Avas mostly responsible for an improve-
ment of £266,122 on the 1921 figures. Coal
is the big item in the total: 10,183,133 tons
last year had a pit’s-mouth value of
£8,507,946. and it has accounted for
£123,453,955 of the State’s aggregate pro-
duction of minerals exceeding 350 millions.
Other contributors have been: Gobi,
£63,180,442 .; silver-lead-zinc. £10(1,791,958 ;
copper, £15,333,578; tin, £12,660,446; iron-
stone, £5.763,189. Though gold has given
18 p.c. of the State’s total, the industry has
so declined that last year the yield repre-
sented less than 1 p.c.
* * * »
The total value of copper production in
N. S. Wales last year was £36,233, and
£5034 less than in 1921. The almost total
eclipse of the industry is shown by the report
of the Warden of the Bathurst mining dis-
trict : “There has been no production in cop-
per, except a little by means of precipitation
at Blayney.” Time was when in this dis-
trict copper-mining was possibly the most
important industry. With copper at about
£80 —sometimes as low as £6o—Avith long
cartage of ore over rough roads to smelters,
and longer haulage of metal by road to Syd-
ney, it was remarkable how miners and
smelters thrived so Avell. Miners would raise
a “paddock” of ore; the smelter rep. nmuld
c-ome along, “grab”-sample it, and in a few
minutes offer so much per ton Avhere it was
stacked. Each knew from experience the
approximate value to close a fair business
deal, and a nip from the buyer’s flask soon
sealed a contract. The only point remain-
ing to be determined was the Aveight, and,
when the ore Avas bagged, the teamster’s
steelyards fixed that in most cases. Con-
trast that system of mutual trust with a
present-day smelter’s “account sale,” which,
in its multitude of deductions and penalties
and allowances for errors in weights and
assays, rivals the average lawyer’s bill of
costs!
Blayney is the mystery copper-mine of
X. S. Wales. It has been worked in differ-
ent wrnys by many cos., but was never a con-
spicuous success. Within the past 10 years
a large quantity of metal'has been won by
pumping the ivater and precipitating the
metal on scrap-iron. This production is con-
fined to the level which separates the oxide
and sulphide zones. Every second or
third year the shaft is baled dow r n to that
level, and so far there has been no consider-
able decrease in the copper precipitate. One
year the boxes yielded 30 tons metal. No
attempt has ever been made to locate the
source of this supply of copper-saturated
ivater, though a large body of ore must lie
close at hand.

The latest N. S. Wales gold-find—declared
to be “the most impr -ssive surface-show dis-
covered in the State for years”—is Bam-
banda Mountain, midway between Hill End
and Mudgee. The most striking feature about
the find is the number of reels contained in
quite a narrow belt. At least seven separate
formations are opened up inside 200 yd.
They range from P in. to 12ft. in w.dth, well-
defined and strong, wal.s good, stone k.ndly,
country rock silurian slate or a type common
to many of our old fields. Several dollied
stone- and loam-tests last week all showed
gold, mostly very fine; and if values of that
type were cons.stent tnroughout the mass its
payable quality could ue admitted. The
open-cut faces, however, show tnat the
character of the stone varies. In one 12it.-
face a central band of 6-n. would probably
go 3oz. or more, but it was irregular in size
and limited in extent. It is plainly a local
enrichment, and that the whole widen will
give ounce results is open to question, me
10-ton crushing now going through will
throw more light on averages. This parcel
appears to have been fairly taken from
several, open-cuts in the 12ft. reef oVer a
length of about 450 ft. Though the general
surface indications are impressive, it is early
to accept the local belief that a new mine
and field have been added to the list. The
bulk values reported should be accepted with
caution : a small crushing of 5 tons for 2oz.
15dwt. per ton does not prove a field. The
locality is within a stone’s throw of the
track connecting the two old fields, and thou-
sands of eager prospectors have evmently
passed by without noticing that beneath the
conglomerates -which cap the ridge were reefs
worthy of testing. Block claims are pegged
for miles, and the usual preparaß ns for
Pitt-street mining are already in evidence.
* * * *
Carpathia Tin (N.S.W*) had no ore pro-
duction last half-year, the only mine-work
done being some prospecting for No. 3 ore
body, but without locating it. The loss for
the term was £1079, and with £3554 brought
forward, the debit balance stands at £4633.
The co. has a fixed deposit of £2546 and a
bank overdraft of £2869. Steps are being
taken to resume operations consequent on
the advance in tin. It is pointed out that,
with metallic tin at £2lO. the co.’s concen-
trates would return only £lO5 per ton. This
means that they cannot run fiO p.c. tin, or
that penalties for impurities are stiff. Re-
duction in freightage and other charges, has
not been followed by corresponding decrease
in ore-buyers’ or smelters’ realisation
charges. Several attempts, have been made
to organise co-operation to insist on reason-
able adjustments, but all have failed. It
has always been a case of “Everyone for
himself and the Devil take the hindmost,”
and in no instance has the latter been the
ore-buyer.
**/ * *
From an Emmaville (N.S.W.) tin-man;—
Great Britain tributors’ last run produced 8 tons
oxide in 155 hours’ sluicing. There is great indig-
nation here over the action of the co. in cancelling
the tribute agreement on a month’s notice with the
intention of running the mine two shifts on wages.
It is considered that, as the tributors worked in
poor ground for many months, and ' earned far less
than award wages, on a fair give-ancl-take rule they
should be allowed to profit now that they are break-
ing bettef dirt and tin is at a good price, and so
be compensated for bad times. It seems a fair
proposition, too.
* * * *
From a practical mechanical-engineer:—
Tingha Tin (N.S.W.) proposes to dispense. with
the fire-eating portable steam-nozzle plants which
now disgrace the Northern tinfields. There are con-
ditions which make these plants indispensable, but
they are few. Their general use accords with the
once-prevalent idea among miners that all that wa"s
necessary to make a payable proposition of a Gin.
vein of silver-lead ore or a small lode of siliceous
oxidised copper-ore was to erect a water-jacket fur-
nace, or in the case of a gold deposit to install a
cyanide plant. So with the tin-man his slogan is
“Give me a portable nozzle plant,” Fuel alone costs
as much as 6d. per yd. on some of the Northern
tin-sluicing mines. The trouble is that jnanagers
have been so wedded to this particular plant that it
is rank heresy for anyone to suggest any departure
therefrom. The manager of the Tingha mine is to
be complimented on having the courage to break
away from the traditional practice, and to be con-
gratulated on having shareholders to back him up
in so doing. A suction-cutter dredging plant is to
be erected on the co.’s Brickwood area. This style
of plant must show largely increased yardage treat-
ment, but that it is going to reduce working costs
from Is. 3d. to 6d. per yd. is, in my opinion, not
within the bounds of possibility. I question whether,
under existing costly working conditions, the Tingha
or any other portable-engine nozzle-plant in the
North can show average working costs as low as
Is. 3d. The directors show their faith in the new
proposition by making a call of Is. per share.
* * * •
Ives Reward (W.A.) has had another
financial shuffle. This time the directors,
backed by pressure from the Westralian
Minister for Mines, have “induced” the
debenture-holders to exchange each of the
8000 £1 debentures for three paid shares,
whose present market value is about Is. 6d.
apiece. This deal wipes out the debenture
debt, and increases the negotiable share issue
by 24,000, a move which, in view of a para-
lysed market, old shareholders are not likely
to relish. The mine is still producing opti-
mistic reports, but calls are being made with
painful regularity.
* * * *
Greenbushes (W.A.) has livened up
again. Several shows have resumed pro-
duction on the strength of the better market
for tin, and others are about to follow. For
a time operations were at a standstill, but
disaster to the settlement was averted by
the Government finding timber-hewing and
sleeper-cutting jobs for the idle miners. To
date the field has produced about a million
pounds’ worth of tin.
* * * *
Option-holders and co, promoters, backed
by newspaper boost, are trying hard to sell
Joness Mining Concessions, beyond Laver-
ton (W.A.). Great Boulder, Paringa, Asso-
ciated, Consolidated Goldfields and other cos.
interested or formerly interested in the West
have been buttonholed in London. Two or
three flotations are expected.
The plant on the Light of Asia, at Cue
(W.A.), was sold by auction the other day.
This mine has had a chequered career. At
one time it was the main producer on the
Murchison, and then became unprofitable.
Little was heard of the property until new
finds gave a fresh spell of prosperity. A
few years ago the show was acquired by
the Mararoa Co., but the deal proved a bad
one for shareholders,
Clark’s, Charters Towers (N.Q.), is still
in the doldrums, and the bottom level (No.
11) looks sick. There’s far more mullock
coming out of the mine than ore,'and the last
fortnight’s clean up amounted to only 69
tons quartz. Boring on the dip of Clark’s
reef was one of the suggestions before the
TowerS Boring Committee, which has a
Government drill and drilling staff at its dis-
posal, but it proved a ‘blank. Before the
block lease on the mine passed to Clark’s
there was a proposal to put £12,000 into a
deep shaft, the Government to provide half,
but Govt.-geologist Reid is understood to
have given it its quietus.
<* * * *
Shareholders in No. 4 North Phoenix,
Gympie (Q.), are not encouraged by the last
crushing; 500 oz. from 800 tons ore. This lot
evidently had no rich slugs in it, and mostly
came from the south drive at the 784 ft.
level, where there is a fair-sized reef but
not much gold. At the 845 ft. level better
quartz is showing, but the reef in both levels
is so small that there can’t be much profit
in the last, return. The drop in values is a
bit sudden, even for the most hardened share-
holder, for last Christmas one ton gave
12570 z., and previously two fair-sized crush-
ings had averaged 28 and 14oz. respectively.
Prospecting has not been pushed on at Mt.
Buchanan and Mt. Madden gold deposits,
north of Chillagoe, owing to the drought.
These are the two low-grade shows
which Arthur Clarke believes Will gal-
vanise the North into activity again.
Mt. Buchanan, from tests made, looks like
an Bdwt. proposition, but as it is out of the
way, some certainty as to quantities and
values should be arrived at, otherwise the
enterprise may go the way of Mt. Quamby.
The Minister for Mines promises a
geological party to look over the country
between Chillagoe and the Palmer,
but conditions are unsuitable at present
owing to lack of water. The old yarn crops
up that there are plenty of good shows, but
that the old hands couldn’t withstand the
glamor of the Towers, Palmer and Hodgkin-
son fields.
The Premier mine, at South Kyneton
(Vic.), owned and worked by W. Eden,
maintains its phenomenal position. Last
crushing of five tons yielded 170 oz. gold,
and in about 12 months the lucky owner has
won 9220 z. from 44 tons. Another crush-
ing is waiting for water. The lease con-
tains three other reefs, all of which have
yielded handsomely. Until recently Eden
worked the show “all on his own.”
* * * *
The latest concerning the new find on the
Queen’s Birthday reef at North Drummond,
near Kyneton (Vic.), is that the vein is
only sin. wide, but shows signs' of perma-
nency. The face of the drive is “thickly
studded with gold.”

New Blue, Bendigo, return for the past
fortnight was 11630 z. from 1294 tons, or
about lSdwt. per ton. A div. of Is. has been
declared, making the fifth jior the current
year—in all 7s. 6d. -(£16,875).

“Bendigonian” : “M.E.” (B. 8/2/’23) sug-
gested the possibility of a goldfield existing
in the vicinity of Melbourne. As far back
ag. 1865 C. F. Nicholls published art’cles in
'Support of a contention that a deep-lead
ex.s.ed between Studley Park and Prince’s
Bridge. He pointed nut that t > the north
and east of the Park the Yarra flowed
through silurian country containing numer-
ous quartz reefs, some of which had'- been
proved to be highly payable. He considered
that the gold from known outcrops and from
oth°r reefs Ion 0" since denuded bad be°n par-
ried down and deposited in the lower portions
of the stream. The old course of the river,
where this gold would have been deposited,
often changed and meandered about the flats
of Collirigwood and Richmond, finally enter-
ing the bay between St. Ivilda and South
Melbourne. Mr. Nicholls’s representations
led to the formation of a co., which sank a
shaft on Collingwood Flat to a depth of
111 ft., through 02ft. of basalt, and found
black sand and a little gold resting on the
silurian bedrock. The co. collapsed owing
to insufficient capital, and no further attempt
to work a deep-lead so near Melbourne has
since been made.

Ballarat Gold Fields, Ltd., formed 27
years ago to work the Rosalind, near Bal-
larat, has just gone into liquidation in Lon-
don. The liquidator’s job was easy, as the
only remaining assets were a tent and an old
gun in Southern Nigeria. Capital was
£75,000, £60,000 of which was paid, in
shares, for the Rosalind. That show proved
a failure, and the lease lapsed 12 years ago,
when funds ran' out. Two years ago the
directors sent a prospector to Nigeria, but
failed to find anything of value.

Burma Corporation keeps well in the run-
ning with Broken Hill as a producer. To
the end of November last the production of
refined lead for the year was 35,811 tons,
and of silver more than 3,800,0000 z., the
totals for the 11 months being 17 and 19 p.c.
respectively more than those for the previous
12 months. The gross profit last year was
approximately £500,000. The estimate of
ore reserves as at .Tuly 1 last was 4,286,857
tons, averaging 24.9 p.c. lead, 22.80 z. silver
and 17.5 p.c. zinc. This tonnage should be
largely increased as the ore-body at No. 7
level is developed. Plant has been enlarged
to 700-tons-a-day capacity, and is to be in-
creased to 1000 tons. Even in that country
of cheap and servile man-power there are
labor troubles: the report states that the
extensions can be “achieved within the limits
of the co.’s own financial resources, provided
that sufficient native laborers can be re-
cruited.”

“The Deacon”: Anent faith-healing and
the story of “Chris” (B. 15/3/’23) about
the death-laden aloe-tree, I can cite an
almost parallel case. A woman, living in
Sydney a few years ago and suffering from
protracted ill-health, was told by the usual
kind friends that the cause of it all was the
box of hair that was the pride of her life.
In it lay the curls of all her children, dead
and alive, in the order in which they had
been born and shorn. Like “Chris’s” invalid
she uprose at daybreak, removed half-a-
dozen of the 'bricks in the yard and buried
the treasure good and deep. Then she felt
so blithe and well that she got breakfast
ready, began on the neglected house, and
has been going strong ever since.
YOU NEVER KNOW.
“What did you say your friend’s name was, Madam?”
“Smith .”
“How does she spell it?”
“10-2-4”: I don’t object to the type of
lady one is apt to meet in the Divorce juris-
diction. Far from it! But when the giddy
thing deplores adultery it makes ome cyni-
cal. Similarly with the Laborites who,
ever since the Federal elections, have been
talking contemptuously of Prime Minister
Bruce’s spats. If there is a more ludicrous
type of fop than the young working-man, as
he may be seen in hordes on holidays, then
I would like to know where he parades, so
that I may avoid the place. Take a glance
at one of Bruce’s critics, as he may be seen
any day at the pony races. He wears no
spats. But his feet are encased in bull-
nosed Yankee patent-leather boots, or in
narrow shoes with toothpick toecaps,
gleaming blindingly from the ministrations
of a “shine-parlor.” His coat is high-waisted,
and it flares away into skirts that are divided
behind by a two-foot slit. Usually this
garment has a superfluity of buttons, sewn
on in clusters. The only one of the entire
collection that serves any purpose fastens
the coat tightly just below the wearer’s breast-
bone. A garnet ring and tiepin often go
with his outfit, and the hat is a blue-grey
creation with black braid round the edge of
the brim, and a large, feminine-looking bow
at the back or side. I noticed one horny-
handed Johnny the other day, with a waist-
coat cut low to show a ready-made tie, featur-
ing the crossed flags of Britain and the
U.S.A. Not always, of course, is the prole-
tarian dude so blatant. The Worker re-
cently quoted with obvious pride this tribute
from the Sydney Sun •
Mr. Forde (Q.) is a type of the newer Labor
members. He uses excellent diction and possesses
a refined voice and a large vocabulary. He is youth-
ful and smartly attired. He is not the only Labor
member who affects white vest-slips in his attire
and sports a silk handkerchief peeping from his coat
pocket.
Spats, anyhow, have their uses: they keep
the feet dry in wet weather, and save the
wearer’s trousers from getting frayed. But
what excuse on God’s earth is there for that
most pathetic of impostures, the “white vest-
slip”?

“Robert Bruce”: Malapropisms? Our
local bowlers were entertaining a visiting
team. There were toasts and speeches to
mark the conclusion of the strenuous tussle,
and, as usual, the many good points of the
pastime were being duly stressed. But
nothing worth reporting was said until one
of the speakers came out with: “And from
the health point of view the glorious game of
bowls is an inestimable boon to men like our-
selves, who follow sanitary occupations.”
The reception of this assurance so surprised
the orator that he upset his whisky in hia
bewilderment.
“Randolph Rentless”: Hope springs eter-
nal in the female breast. A Newtown (Sydney)
lady has just taken unto herself her sixth
husband, and is all the more hopeful about
the prospects because hitherto her matri-
monial ventures were mostly failures. “Only
one of my husbands was much good,” she
explained to a friend, “and he died four
months after we were married.” She is
trusting to the law of averages to give her a
golden time now'.
* * * *
“Sidweelan”: It is irony that Mellish
Reef—the death-trap which lies directly in
the track of vessels bound to and from the
Solomons —should prove the
graveyard of the well-known
island steamer Mindini after
the many attempts made by
her skipper, Captain Voy,
to plant a few cueoanuts on
the reef that the danger-spot
might be the more easily
“picked up” by mariners. *-So
long ago as 1910 I was one
of a party which, at Captain
Voy’s suggestion, landed on
Mellish in company with W.
H. Lucas, then manager of
Burns-Philp’s Island De-
partment. for the above-
mentioned purpose. Unfor-
tunately neither this nor
subsequent plantings by Cap-
tain Toy were rewarded
with success. The young
palms were uprooted by the
heavy seas which at times
break right across the
treacherous, low-lying cay.
Incidentally, it was the
breeding season for seabirds
at the time of our visit,
and the sand patch which
comprises the centre of
the reef was covered with
nests, all containing either
young birds or eggs in vari-
ous stages of incubation.
The birds rose in a cloud as
the launch approached the
reef, and some of the more
pugnacious ones attacked us
vigorously, having to be
beaten off with such weapons
as we could lay our hands
on. After we had landed,
however, they speedily grew
reconciled, and, settling down on their nests,
allowed us to handle them. It was interest-
ing to note that beside each nest was a little
heap of fish, evidently the result of hubby’s
shopping.

“Bill Bowyang”: He is one of those
patriotic old gentlemen who enter into
conversation with every returned Digger
they meet. On the Rand wick tram he became
interested in Private Bluey Peters, late of
the Camel Corps. “H’m! suffering from
malaria. I’m afraid? he said. “Yes,” re-
plied Bluey. “Got it through drinking
water in the Wady Ghuzze, near Gaza. We
were fed up with drinking water that the
vets, said was sterilized, and when we came
to the stream in the Wady we couldn’t resist
takin’ in a supply.” “I suppose you were very
sick before you were sent back to Australia ?”
continued the kind old citizen. “My oath I

“Tour confounded dog has chewed my frock all up.”
“ Oh, help! He must have thought it was a dinner dress.”
was,” replied Bluey; “I was so bad I used
to look in the casualty lists for my own
name,”
“Bildad”: The latest Victorian mystery
raises the question whether the average
person is so consumed with curiosity about
next-door’s affairs as some imagine. The
scene was laid in a village, and close to a
fair-sized town, about 45 milbs from Mel-
bourne. A widow of some property dis-
appeared in July, 1922. She and her deceased
husband had been local institutions, they
and their nursery and gardening business
being known far and wide. Some languid
inquiries being made of a person who looked
as if he might know, it was explained that
the lady, at the age of 65, had got the wander-
lust, or something, and had gone to the
Northern Territory without saying good-bye
to anybody and without her departure being
noticed. She didn’t write from the great
dim North. Later questionings at the same
source as to the date of her probable return
evolved the explanation that she had been
back in secret, and after seeing no one had
stealthily evaporated again. After seven or
eight months of this, either the local limb
of the law noticed that one of his flock was
missing, or someone else moved in the
matter, and detectives proceeded to look in
the Yarra and elsewhere, but especially in
the Yarra. That river is the Melbourne
’tec’s best Mend, being big enough to
beguile foolish people to throw things
in, yet not big enough, if one knows
its currents and its ways, to hide any-
thing when it is in. The local inhabitant
has such a boundless faith in his carry-all
stream as a receptacle, that if he loses a
dead secret or the family skeleton he goes
there to look for it. Whatever cat or
cooking stove or other trifle the force found
on this occasion has nothing to do with the
story, which is merely a philosophical reflec-
tion on the calm of the rural mind, and its
lack of the inquisitorial tendency. Seven
months is a long time for a home-keeping
old lady to be unaccounted for, even if she
is supposed to have gone whale-fishing or
hunting the wild ass in Persia.
w * * *
“Vanikoro”: Some points likely to be
fruitful in controversy are raised by the
original Cook log, now in the possession of
Mr. Bolckow, of Marton, Yorkshire, which
is to be sold shortly, and which the Mitchell
Library hopes to obtain. The alterations,
such as the change of the name Stingray
Harbor to Botany Bay, have been made in
a different ink and apparently in a different
handwriting to that in the rest of the log.
If Cook did not make them, who did? Was
his log overhauled and the changes made by
some official of the Admiralty? Botany Bay
was the third effort in nomenclature, for
“Botanist Bay” was first substituted for
“Stingray Harbor.” The approximation of
Botany Bay to “Baie des Herbages,” which
is found on a map made more than two cen-
turies before Cook’s time, may be a mere
coincidence.
“Digger’s Batman” : The various German
troops had their own peculiar methods, which
enabled seasoned A.1.F.-ers to tell who were
opposite them, even
before whispers fil-
tered down from
H.Q. Those that
made us most un-
comfortable were
the Wurtemburg-
ers, who when they
took over had a
nasty habit of
“feeling” with ar-
tillery fire all over
the area opposed to
them. They did it in
so exact a fashion
that not a quarter-
acre was left out of
their polite atten-
tions. It was not
pleasant. But Wur-
temburger patrols
and such-like
caused us no
trouble —if they
couldn’t get away
they kameraded. On
the other hand, to
have the Saxons
opposite us meant a
quiet spell. Our
ow n 18-pounders
once broke the
peace, laying a bar-
rage upon a line
which they guessed
was the enemy
front position. The
guess was preity
right, for when , the
barrage lulled a
notice in big Eng-
lish letters bobbed
up. It read : “Play
the game, Austra-
lians.” The re-
minder that they
were not doing us
any harm touched
our hearts.
“H.K.”: As “F. Clinton” (B. l/3/’23)
observes, old-time surveyors had quaintly
pleasant notions of nomenclature. When
they were laying out the site for the present
town of Bombala (N.S.W.) they were at a
loss for a street name. “Well, it’s a fine-
looking street at present!” was the con-
temptuous comment of one. , Whereupon
the inevitable local patriot standing nearby
chipped in with “But it may be a street some
day.” And as Maybe-street it is officially
known now.

“Stellsby”: Re saluting the quarter-deck,
how does “Speculum” (B. 8/3/’23) account
for the saluting of the “quarter-deck” of a
naval barracks consisting of brick-and-mortar
executive offices and a shaky flagstaff? I
can’t accept the religious origin of the naval
salute. Didn’t Henry VIII. beget the British
Navy with the Great Harry? There wasn’t
much of Holy Church in her make-up, much

less “Catholic ritual.” No. Men salute the
quarter-deck because it symbolises authority,
for the same reason that A.B.’sand quarter-
masters, immediately they top the bridge
ladder, salute the bridge of any well-disci-
plined merchantman.

THE BALLADE OF A BLIGHTED LIFE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am the butt of Fortune’s spite,
The prey of Circumstance’s hate;
A glum, ill-starred, afflicted wight,
My nice new teeth I vainly grate;
Yea, let the dentist confiscate
Those mortgaged molars, I’d not mind,
For I am in an awful strait —
My little Mary is unkind!
’Twas just last Christmas that a blight
Fell on our union intimate;
I live again that fatal night
And see once more the laden plate.
The aftermath I’ll not relate,
’Twould shock too much the muse refined ;
The net result I’ll simply state —
My little Mary is unkind!
I give her many a tempting bite,
And many a rich and dainty cate,
And how does she my care requite?
Alas 1 with pangs I can’t abate.
Of her disdain I feel the weight
Deep in my breast; with lead I’m lined;
Oh, most uncomfortable fate,
My little Mary is unkind!
Envoy.
Bah, Pussyfoot, why do you prate!
The cake’s worse than the ale, 1 find;
For ’tis because of what I ate
My little Mary is unkind!

‘Bloomsbury”: There is something like
romance in the last line of a cable about
the King’s recent lev6e and presentations:
“and J. R. Mitchell by the Agent-General of
Tasmania.” The last time I met this big,
energetic, one-armed Seotch-Australian he
was trying to get the South more interested
in the gems of Anakie, in the Queensland
backblocks. Having lost a limb, he had
left off being a miner, and was trying to
make a better market for other Northern
miners’ goods. Then he got to England,
wangled a job in Lever’s, and somehow
managed to take the boss’s eye. And a fine
eye for picking men is Lord Leverhulme’s.
Once he recommended a man to another big
firm, and later met the head. “Sorry,” said
the latter, “I couldn’t place that man you
sent me. Didn’t take to him, somehow.”
“What was the matter with him?” asked
Lever. “Well, he’s a half-sized man, for one
thing—only about so high.” “Oh,” replied
Lever; “I go on a different line. I measure
men from the chin up.” However, Mitchell
would pass no matter which way he was
measured. When I saw him next he was
in charge of confectionery works into which
Lever had put over half-a-million on the
security of debentures. The thing had
been a failure, and when Lever took it over
lie put in the old Anakie battler as the like-
liest man to make a success of it.
“N.J.S.”: A popular Australian RIC.
bishop tells this yarn against hipiself. After
giving away the prizes at the “speech-day”
he overheard an argument between two of
the boys as to which was the bigger pot—
the Bishop, who had just handed out the
prizes, or the Judge, who had had the job the
year before. “The Judge all right,” said one,
to conclude matters, “because he can say
‘You be hanged.’” “The Bishop can beat
that,” replied the other. “He can say ‘You
be damned.’ ” This seemed a knock-out, but
after a moment’s thought the Judge’s backer
finished the argument with : “Yes, but when
a judge says ‘You be hanged,’ you are
hanged.”
“ IT’S AN ILL WIND ” —
COUNSEL : “What are your present means of
support?”
CARTOONIST : “I haven’t got any.”
COUNSEL: "Well, what has been your recent
means?”
CARTOONIST: “Billy Hughes's £25,000.”
A QUESTION OF ALLOWANCES.
“Jack says when we are married he won't allow me much out of his sight!”
“ Oh, don't bother about that. Has lie said how much he’ll allow you out of his income?”
“Pipards”: The English Jack Ketch gets
more press notice, whether he likes it or not,
than his Australian co-craftsman. For in-
stance, most of the U.K. papers that pub-
lished accounts of the hanging of the Ilford
murderers concluded with a tribute of this
sort to the operators:—
Willis and Pierrepont carried out the execution
of Bywaters in Pentonville. Ellis and Pierrepout,
jun., executed Mrs. Thompson.
There’s a grisly sound about that “jun.” If
there is a qualified practitioner of the busi-
ness of sending murderers “to a far coun-
tree” (as Thomas Hardy puts it) who has
brought up a son to the trade, he must be
an outsize in horrors.
w * # *
“S.T.S.”: Malapropisms, is it? Well, that
implies unintentional use of a wrong word.
But how about the one “lonely” word (as
the poet says) which gives the vivid idea,
yet which nobody but that particular speaker
would dream of using? Our Mary Anne
went out, for a social evening, in light-blue
satin. She returned with the front of it
ruinously soiled. But she disclaimed all sym-
pathy. It was regrettable, certainly, but
the kind of thing that might happen in any
friendly gathering. “A young man threw a
large piece of luscious fat at me.” That
word “luscious” seems to be a triumph.
* * * *
“Good Aussie” : The mania for collecting
oddities seems to afflict club members, too.
At a conference of secretaries of eight affili-
ated clubs in the six States these snappers-
up of trifles are annually
discussed under the head
of balance-sheet losses.
Melbourne loses 50 face
towels a week; Sydney
misses 10 tumblers a day ;
Adelaide is exasperated
by members who pinch all
the hair combs ; Brisbane
complains bitterly of
clubmen who pocket 40
cakes of soap weekly;
Perth misses whole stacks
of newspapers ; Hobart, is
“shy” of hundreds of tea-
spoons every stocktaking.
At Launceston and Fre-
mantle, however there are
no complaints worth men-
tioning. possibly because
everything portable
except the billiard-tables,
is either chained up or
tied down.
* *
“Chris”: In a way a
doctor may give evidence
—posthumous of course—
about his own death. Dr.
Alexander, who died in
the Chatham Islands re-
cently, kept a record of
his own illness, and told a John Hop that he
expected to go off at any moment. He had
had a heart attack, and feared that the next
one would be fatal. As he left a statement
of the cause of his impending death, he prac-
tically signed the usual certificate. There
was nobody else to do it, anyway.
* * *•- «
“Zanthus”: Even if H.M.A.S. Australia is
sunk or broken up there may still be a war-
ship of the name afloat, though it will never
come this way. Captain Blacker, of the
Guides, mentions in his book, “On Secret
Patrol in High Asia,” that the Russian
Volunteer Fleet in the Caspian Sea in 1919
included a vessel called the Australia. Early
in 1920 it was reported that the crew of the
anti-Bolshevik Australia had thrown the offi-
cers overboard, and joined the Bolshies.
Blacker does not say how the Australia re-
ceived her name. But there was during the
war a highly-placed officer in the Russian
Navy who had previously fled from his coun-
try to save his life, and had found a refuge,
not to mention also a wife, in Sydney. He
might know something about it.
* * *
“Horton”: It was in a French town re-
cently evacuated by the Huns that the garru-
lous old madame of our billet confided to me
one day that, before the invaders had
gathered in her husband, he
had managed to bury a large
case of wine at the bottom
of the garden. It was not
long before several hefty and
thirsty Australians, armed
with picks and shovels, were
hard at work on the indi-
cated spot. After an hour’s
solid graft we struck wood,
and, prising open the lid of
the case, made a simultane-
ous dive into the top cover-
ing of straw. Imagine our
disappointment when, in-
stead of bottles, we drew out
a collection of cups and
saucers! Several of the ex-
humation party looked as if
they would like to vent their
wrath on the crockery, but
the humorous side of the
situation came uppermost.
Unable to retrieve her
cherished collection herself,
the old girl had hit on this
plan. And though she had
induced us to dig under false
pretences, she soon made
amends. Leading us into the
place she produced Several
bottles of rare old Beaune,
cleverly concealed beneath
some flooring boards, and,
after these had been negoti-
ated, presented each man
with a saucer as a; souvenir. The latter I,
for one, did not appreciate at the time, but
I often wonder how many of my fellow
Diggers discovered that their mementos were
genuine pieces of Sevres china.
“Lex”: At Darlinghurst (Sydney) Ses-
sions a particularly unpleasant type of
offender named Zthrowski was up for marry-
ing a girl of 18 without her mother’s con-
sent. Counsel for Zthrowski proceeded to
cross-examine the mother: —
Counsel: You would like to have this man put
into gaol?
Witness: Yes, but 1 think gaol is too good for
him. He should be flogged.
Counsel: 1 suppose you would have him sent to
Hell if you could?
Witness: My daughter is not the first young girl
he had interfered with. Since proceedings were
taken against him several young girls have called
at my house and made statements against him.
Counsel: You should not ha-ve said that.
Hideously damaging to the accused, of course,
yet, as a matter of fact, it was exactly the
sort of thing she should have said, and that
every witness should make a point of say-
ing as often as counsel exceeds the limits of
decency in cross-examination. The Judge
(who subsequently gave Zthrowski a well-
earned six months) voiced the sentiments of
most citizens when he remarked, by way of
comment on counsel’s protest: -“You asked
for it—and you got it.”

“210” : I don’t know whether France still
winks an eye at the citizen who supports two
homes, but I tender the following as evidence
that she did during the Big Argument. The
chef of an li.M.O.’s mess in Rouen, although
physically fit and under the age for exemp-
tion from front-line service, had never dipped
his bayonet in Boche blood. A little sleuth-
ing by an inquisitive member of the mess
elicited that Henri possessed a wife and two
children in Rouen, while Paris sheltered an-
other lady whose three children also recog-
nised Ilenri as the author of their being. The
French conscription laws provide for the
exemption of the father of live from firing-
line duties; so Henri held his base job.
“Centurion” on Abdul’s military qualities :
With all respect to “Griffith Moses” (13. 8/3/’23)
I cannot accept his dictum that the Turk is a better
fighter under capable leaders than the Zulu or Ghoorka.
It is difficult to compare the Zulu, who has done all
his fighting as a savage, with the Turk, who for
centuries lias used “civilised” methods. Still, I
am old enough to have known many men, English
regulars and Afrikanders, who considered that nothing
modern could excel the amazingly disciplined Zulu

infantry in attack, which, by the way, was also the
only method of defence they practised. The Ghoorka,
whose very name is dreaded by the Afghan or
Pathan. was always the finest fighter in India proper,
and he fully sustained his reputation on Gallipoli
and in Palestine, where Abdul was his opponent.
The Turk has possibly no' equal, and certainly no
superior, when he is defending a really well-prepared
position, but in Palestine English Territorials often
ousted him from good natural and improvised cover.
And the modern Turk, at all events, does not like
stiff opposition in the open, and fears the least
threat of a flank envelopment. Generally speaking,
whatever he was in the days of Sobieski, lie is not
much of a serious threat nowadays to a well-trained
European force when other things are equal.
DESECRATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Carlton Ministers’ Association protests
warmly against children ueing allowed to play in
Prince’s Park on the Sabbath Hay, declaring it to
be desecration.”
I see the children on the grass;
Their dancing eyes with joy are -lit.
With cheerful games the time they pass,
But, oh, the fearful sin of it!
I hear their joyous laughter swell,
I see them scamper to and fro,
While all in vaiii the Sabbath bell
Calls them to Sunday-school to go.
They join their hands, and make a ring; -
Their happy voices mock the day ;
And some poor pagan song they sing—
Their little souls are very gay.
They move in seeming innocence,
They’re breathing freely God's good air;
But ’tis the Sabbath morning, hence
They should be toiling otherwhere.
They should be taught how Moses smote
The sea apart, a moving tale;
They should be learning off by rote
How Jonah lived inside a whale.
It may not quite so healthy be
With texts and hymns to have them crammed,
But better a sick child to see
Than one that is completely damned.

MUMMY AND MAUDIE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Parisian and London dressmakers are utilising
the discoveries in Tutankhamen’s tomb to popularise
mummy frocks, swathed like Egyptian wrappings,
clinging to the legs.”
The damsel who is up-to-date
Reverts to fashions hoary;
She wipes the ages off the slate
With Tutankhamen’s glory;
Though mother’s frock is obsolete,
A mummy’s gowns are chic and sweet.
And Maude, superlatively smart,
Old Luxor’s tombs will plunder,
She’d pine h a skirt from Pharaoh’s tart
To make her cobbers wonder;
A shroud provides her brave array,
The grave itself makes her go gay.
Maude thinks a cerement's just the thing—
She’s very contradictory—
And with St. Paul she’ll gaily sing,
“Oh. grave, where is thy victory?”
Old Tut himself cannot complain,
Nor Adam—though she. raises Cain.

P. J. STRUTT,
Under-
Treasurer of
Tasmania, who
is bus a on the
job of truing to
make five go
into four.
Like Minogue, the ex-TJnder Treasurer of
Vic., Percy Whitton, Comptroller of Customs,
went out suddenly and unexpectedly.
Twenty-two years ago Whitton relinquished
the job of accountant to the Mines Depart-
ment to become chief clerk in the Federal
Audit Office. From that he passed to the
head of Customs in the State, and then to
the comptroller,ship. lie must have taken a
lot out of himself, for he liked to be master
of whatever task he was tackling. Yet he
managed to preserve a youthful appearance
to the last, and no one well acquainted with
his career would have guessed he was 62. It
was remarkable that he should have so soon
followed his old friend Minogue, who took
the Mines accountancy when he vacated it.
Both were then striving hard to ascend the
promotion ladder. Each got to the top and
found a path that led—to the grave.
“F.J.” 1 Of the 50 delegates to the Federal
Convention which opened at Adelaide,
March 22, 26 years ago, there are 15 survi-
vors: Joe Carruthers and W. McMillan
(N.S.W.) ; John Quick, Alec Peacock, Jus-
tices Isaacs and Higgins, and W. A. Tren-
with (Vic.) ; Dr. Cockburn, Justice Gordon,
Josiah Symon and Paddy Glynn (S.A.) ;
Elliott Lewis and M. J. Clarke (Tas.) ;
and W. T. Loton and Walter James (W.A.).
Ten of these were barristers, four (including
Quick) are now on the Bench, and all ex-
cept Carruthers, Peacock and Lewis have
dropped out of Parliament. Loton, who is
well over 80, is the eldest, and Walter James,
60 on March 28, is the youngest, just three
weeks dividing the natal days of Clarke and
James.
“Nick” Healy, a member of the old Sydney
swimming family, was one of the first in the
revived cotton business in Queensland, and
he has so saturated himself with its teclmi-
calities that he lias
produced a book on
the subject. Healy
was amongst tlie
first Diggers to
leave Australia. At
Gallipoli he got a
bullet through his
stomach; and
although it was no
good for his diges-
tion for a time a
fine constitution
helped him through.
R. T. BALL,
Minister for
Unprofitable
Railways and other
Works in N. S.
Wales.
J. J. O’Kelly, one of the two members of
the “Irish Republican Oversea Mission”
whom Do Valera has moved on from
r.S.A. to Australia, was ths Minister
of Education and the National Language in
the first, and second Dail Eireanns. He is
dramatist, author and historian, and is
reckoned one of the greatest of Gaelic
scholars. The other missioner is. Father
O’Flanagan: he it was who recited the
opening prayer at the first meeting of the
Dail Eireann, and lots of people regard him
as the real founder of the present Irish
Republican movement. A great speaker is
Father O’Flanagan.
John Francis Hume Mitchell, who died
the other day at Ravenswood (Vic.), was
about the last of the pioneers of the
Riverina; they comprised the . Humes, the
Fenners, the Huons and the Mitchells. His
mother, who was born at Parramatta in
1797, was the only daughter of _Captain
Gabriel Louis Marie Huon de Kerilleau, a
member of a refugee Bourbon family who
wifh given a commission in the British Army
and sent to Sydney in 1788; his father was
Captain Mitchell, a retired Imperial officer.
After the father’s death the family removed
to the Hume River, which was discovered by
Hamilton Hume, a relative of Mrs.
Mitchell’s, where they took up land. James
Mitchell became the owner of Table Top
station, Thomas of Bringenbong, Edward of
Fanlight, and John of Hawksview. When
a lad John Mitchell lived amongst the Mur-
ray blacks, and made a study of their lan-
guage, of which he compiled a dictionary.
About a good citizen and great banker:—
T. A. Dibbs, who died in Sydney last week-end,
aged 91, entered the service of the Commercial
of Sydney when he was scarcely tall enough to look
over the counter ; at 35 he became general manager,
and he did not retire until he was 83. He never
let red-tape strangle his' humanity. The personal
factor counted with him tremendously. For years
his staff was the best paid in Australia, and if they
were not out looking for recreation at 4.30 he war
uneasy. With his clients it was much the same.
Two young- business men had got into a mess and
went to him for accommodation. He showed them
what various sorts of fool they had been and raked
them fore and aft. Then he told them to come back
after lunch. They thought it wasn’t worth while;
still as a matter of courtesy they >werit. What Dibbs
said to them was: “You have asked for £6OOO.
That’s no good to you. Now, I’m going to help you
put your business on its legs. You’ll want £.BOOO
to do it. You can have it.” Dibbs had summed
up his men, and he was not wrong. He raruy
was. A fine yachtsman in his day, the breezy
manner lived with him. In the strenuous times ot
30 years ago the bank managers of Sydney used to
meet to talk over their problems. At one meeting
John Russell French was laying down the law—very
positively, rather ponderously. It was Dibba who
interrupted the extremely formal proceedings with,
“I’ll bet you drinks you’re wrong, French.” And
most likely he was, if Dibbs said so.
Among the “old boys” who the other day
congratulated Priminister Bruce on having
got some of his education at Melbourne
Grammar was the hoary constitutional law-
yer, Edward Mitchell, who, with Bruce and
30 others, battled for the Flinders pre-selec-
tion in 1918. So great was the rush that
the selection committee limited the aspi-
rants to 10-minute speeches on the political
subjects nearest their hearts. Mitchell, re-
garded by the Argus as a certainty, made a
very poor impression, whereas the young
stranger from Flinders-lane, who had dis-
covered the happy knacK of conciseness—
for that occasion, anyway—had the verdict
as soon as he opened his mouth. Allowing
for the silent appeal of his military record
Bruce won squarely on his merits.
“F.J.”: Fifty-one years on March 20 since
W. C. Wentworth died in England. One
hundred and twenty-seven years on the same
date since the birth of E. Gibbon Wakefield,
the coloniser. Forty-six years on March 25
since the passing of Caroline Chisholm, “the
emigrants’ friend.”
Stuart Ronald, one of the two Adelaide
lawyers who have got magistracies owing to
Mitchell visiting England and Hewitson go-
ing to the Industrial Court, is a member of
a clever firm which has already sent Poole
to the Supreme Court bench. The only
partners now left are Johnstone and Kitson,
the latter being a lady. Tom Bright, the
other new beak, is an authority on all games,
indoor and out, and a noted amateur carna-
tion grower. He was a member of that
brilliant firm which saw John Gordon be-
come a judge, James Gordon a police-
magistrate and Nesbit and Jim Anderson
Iv. C’s. Ronald was with the great 10th Bat-
talion in the war.
Ex-Educution Minister Tom Mutch, at
one time a pet of the N.S.W. industrialists,
and the most, fervent kicker-out of them all,
has gained the enmity of the reddest portion
of the A.L.P. ; and he was the first victim
of personal assault in the stormy proceedings
of the executive. His enemies (and some
of bis friends) assert that Mutch’s experience
as Minister for Education has completely
altered his outlook upon many matters; but
his new-found asperity is what most ruffles
old-time colleagues. Seeing that, before he
was himself an M.L.A., he was one of the
hardest fighters for the control of politicians
by the executive —at one conference he
framed a resolution demanding that Labor
legislators should leave a signed resignation
with the A.L.P., so that it might be sent in
if pledges were thought to be disregarded—
Mutch’s support of the politicians’ attitude
is looked upon as a traitorous defection. But
Mutch was a good Minister for Education,
anyway.
“Lou” on two old pals:—
I saw Ted Theodore leave Broken Hill with his
swag up. Next time I struck him we were both working
around the mines at Ohillagoe and Mungana. He
was a perfect freak with the “kip,” and could
“head ’em” five or six almost every spin. He was
dain-making, too, about that time for the mining
cos., and later was timekeeper and union rep. on
Frew and Oo.’s short length of railway until he
became organiser for the Associated Workers’ Asso-
ciation, taking in bush workers and miners, with
its office in Chillagoe. Mick Woods, a loco, engine-
driver, was Labor member for the then new Ohillagoe
seat, but he broke away and Theodore claimed the
right to contest it, and has represented what is about
the smallest number of .electors in the State ever
since. About this time Mac Cormack, Home Secretary
now, was out of work ; so he was appointed secretary
of the union, and then things began to move. Theo-
dore still kept on organising after he was elected
member, and the pair reached out for a big amal-
gamation that later gave the A.W.U. its first footing
away from shearing-sheds. Mac Cormack was a great
mob orator, and could turn hovding antagonism into
thunderous applause. Yet, later, in the House, he
was a silent member. But he has continued to be
a power in the union room —a big man every wai-;
bigger, I think, than the Premier.
Died last week, in Sydney, the widow of
H. C. Russell, who in pre-Federation days
was N. S. Wales astronomer and Govern-
ment meteorologist. Mrs. Russell figured
in one early Bulletin story. A flapper
friend —though flappers hadn’t then been in-
vented—told one of the Russell girls that
in Sydney’s changeable climate it must be
a great thing to have a meteorologist for a
father. “Oh,” said she, “we don’t go by
father’s forecasts. We go by ma’s corns.”
“D.F.” : Peter Simonoff was not the only
Bolshevik who returned from Australia to
bleeding Russia. In his book, “With the
Diehards in Siberia,” Colonel Ward. M.P.,
says that at Bogotol, in Western Siberia,
he inquired into the imprisonment of an
Australian named Savinoff. The anti-Bol-
shevik authorities produced the dossier of
the case, which proved Savinoff to have been
a Bolshevik leader and second in command
of an armed band that had tried to murder
the local authorities of the place. Ilis chief
was Titoff, who had been one of the central
committee of the Baltic Fleet, and had
ordered the murder of hundreds of Russian
naval officers. Ward mentions that both
Savinoff and Titoff were tried soon after
this, but he does not say what happened to
them. Can anyone place Savinoff?
, “Wullie” Affleck was one of the pet aver-
sions of W. P. Crick. When Paddy was
N.S.W. Minister for Lands Affleck stirred
up a matter in which he hinted strongly at
SENATOR GIVENS, who is lack in his old
seat as President of the Senate.
corruption. “Humbug !” interjected Crick.
But Affleck persisted in talking about the
rectitude that should prevail amongst
M’sL.A. “Let us pray!” mocked Crick.
“Preying is the honorable member’s habit,”
retorted Affleck.
Passed the home signal at 71, George
Boyd Stack, C.E., of Brisbane. He had
waved a hand over ’most every railway line,
in its construction stages, from Stanthorpe
to Cooktown. His widow used to call the
lath Lieut.-Gov. Arthur Morgan brother.
“Wesley” : Two records belong to the Rev.
Samuel Gilby, of Morpeth (N.S.W.). He
is the first Methodist parson in Australia
to complete 50 years’ work in the pulpit;
and he has never taken a holiday. lie is
still continuing his ministry. “No man is
really old until he feels old,” he says.
Dr. Bryan’s name will be treasured in Mel-
bourne Scotch College annals. For three
years (1875-1878) he was at Scotch, and
then went to London. Rising to the top of
the medical profession he practised in Harley-
street, and acquired sufficient wealth to
enable him to will £5OOO for scholarships to
the school he left when he was 16. In addi-
tion he has given £l5O, the income from which
is to be used for the purchase of a cup for
the best cricket fieldsman. The doc. was
in the college eleven 44 years ago.
In the 46th vol. of the “Transactions and
Proceedings of the Royal Society <>f South
Australia” —one of the most valuable publica-
tions issued by a scientific body in Australia
—R. S. Rogers, M.D., M.A., the president,
and probably the greatest authority on Aus-
tralian orchids, traces the interesting history
of this Adelaide society from its genesis in
London, in August, 1834, before S. Aus. was
proclaimed. And, incidentally, he mentions
that tur Uhas. Napier, the hero of Scinde,
was suggested as the colony’s first Governor,
and hence was the first president of the
society. The doyen of the society is Walter
Rutt, C.E., who was elected a Fellow in
1869, was for 23 years treasurer, and has
been sec, for the last 15 years. Prof. Walter
Howehin, the geologist, has been editor of
the "Proceedings” for the last 29 years.
A note from the Federal Gallery
Lambert, is almost as taciturn as Bailey
(B. 15/3/’23). He has made only about three
speeches in the House, and two of them were dragged
from him by.Catts. Previously he had been regarded
as quiet and' inoffensive, and his pigeon-toed creep
into the Labor corner, where he invariably sat with
arms folded and legs crossed in an attitude of respect-
ful attention, encouraged the illusion of a sad and
even bashful personality crushed by the proximity
of his peers. But Catts’s charges against the Bailey
clique turned the dove into an eagle, who wanted
nothing better than to bury his beak in the corpse
of his detractor. His answering shouts ran along
various lines of counter-recrimination, with the
usual challenge to the dishonorable member to repeat
his charges outside. The effect would have been
greater had he hired a Town Hall and reiterated
what he had roared about Catts, but Lambert isn't
that kind of' fighter. He always wants to put the
onus of speaking without “privilege” on the other
fellow.
DREAM VOYAGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Broadway lights are far from home,
The only home I know.
Manhattan's Babel, tower and dome,
Its noisy wealth and show,
Are with me all the waking day ;
But in my dreams I sail away.
Soon as mine eyes are closed in sleep
A New York Central train,
By Hudson river broad and deep,
Goes west with me again;
In my fond dreams I quickly go
Past Albany and Buffalo.
By the lake’s shore to Illinois
The engine’s all too slow,
For that a minute they employ
To flash through Ohio;
And nigh an hour to cross the lana
From Kansas to the Rio Grand.
And half a minute south and west
Takes me to Hornby light,
The ferries on the harbor breast
Gemmed shuttles in the night;
Too slow the bowscarf breaks in foam
For me who’d spend the night at home.
I see again the blood-red road
That leads to Redland Bay;
And Cleveland’s water, blue as voad,
Gleam to the sun-drenched day;
And paper-barks like ghosts at dawn,
And flame-trees’ fire above the lawn.
There is a cottage in the hills
Above the sandstone shore;
A bay that the Pacific fills
Till it can bold no more;
And in my dreams ’tis there 1 stay
Where the cicadas sing all day.
Sifted with gold the gum-trees arc,
At dawn and noon and dusk ;
The night, that brings the steadfast; star,
Brings also scent of musk;
And in the cottage on the slope,
Three people sit with love and hope.
The perfume of the bush around
Comes in the breath of morn:
The eastern sea, too strong for sound,
Floods to the fields of corn;
And there we three eat up the day,
Till daybreak orders me away.
And then, unwilling, I return,
By north and east, ■to wake
Where Broadway’s white lights flame and burn
For this great city’s sake;
But finer every tower and dome
Because I spent the night at home.

BARNES-LINSEED OIL
TIME HADN’T GONE QUICKLY.
THE STRANGER: “And how long have you been here?”
THE OLDEST INHABITANT : “ Seventy-five year.”
THE STRANGER: “You must be very old.”
THE O.H.: “Oh, no; I was only ten when I come.”
“Basalt Boulder”: Some time ago
“Gouger” made inquiries about blowers and shakers.
Well, I’ll back a Horton blower against any shaker
in the world for metal recovery—tin, gold, bismuth
or wolfram—for quantity of muck put through and
for ease of working. The most dirt I ever saw
handled was on the old Laneevvood diggings, out
from Mount Surprise (N.Q.), when a father and three
sons kept one of the best piek-and-shovel artists
in Australia going for the lick of his life in a loose
4ft. face of wash dirt. The dad is known as “Old
Slippery” all over the North. Once when I was
sympathising with him for having such a big family
of kids (10) he said: “I wish there was 10 more
of the little blanks —they get a of a lot of tin.”
The dirt put through by his team was 90yds. a week,
averaging 31b. a yard. Is this a record? The
blower was made by Slippery himself. He is a
Towers native. The effete North again !
“Pick”: Let me introduce “Mulgaite” (B.
l/3/’23) to big Harry Thompson, of Moonbar
(N.S.W.). He was one of the big guns in the
blade-shearing days of the ’eighties—he never
cottoned on to the machines —and still cleans
up most of the cookies’ flocks where shearing plants
have not been installed on MOnaro. Though 76-
six years the senior of “Mulgaite's” nomination —
the shearing before last at Alpine View, where I
toiled alongside him, he turned out 102, and we
helped with the pressing at smoke-oh and joe-time.
This summer, at the same shed, lie lifted the coals
off 94, 92 and 97 in three successive days, and
reckoned he was taking things easy, so as not to
cut himself out of a shed and a good home before
Christmas Day.
“W.D.G.”: In spite of “Aek F. C.” (B.
8/2/’23), I believe “Keystring” and his 5000 ’roos
in four years (B. 18/l/’23). Herb Gates, of Wil-
cannia (N.S.W.), shot over 300 in one week in
1919. .Another shooter I knew in the Barrier district
collected over 1800 skins in three months and carted
them between 30 and 40 miles to the railway. These
are much higher daily averages than “Keystring's,”
and the transport part of the business didn’t worry
either of the men —5000 ’roo skins would be, roughly,
only five tons.
* * * *
“Centre”: “Tedmulgar” (B. 22/2/’2B)
says the foxglove is highly poisonous, especially the
seeds, which would cause trouble if cut with nay
or silage. Has, then, this plant taken to poisoning
since its introduction to Australia? I remember
when a nipper helping in the hayfields in the
Cold Country, and the foxglove went down before
the scythe with whatever else was in the paddocks.
We certainly did nothing in the way of clearing
that particular weed out of the hay before stacking,
and never had any complaints from either Strawberry
or Baldy. I've heard the sap is poisonous, though
not to any great extent, and am wondering whether
it becomes harmless when dry. What’s the verdict
of the Council?
* * * #
“Perdix”: Here’s a late though legitimate
entry for the Endurance Stakes. In the bush, six
miles from Wynyard (Tas.), a woodcarter was
twitching up his load when the twist-stick broke,
and he was hurled to the ground, where a sharp
stake entered his groin. After staying in his bush-
camp that day and night he set out with the team
and delivered his wood at Wynyard. Then he
went home to bed with an “injured foot,” but his
mother became suspicious when five days showed no
impi-ovement, and sent for a doctor. He found
that the man had already, with needle and thread,
sewn up a wound necessitating on his part a
modest 15 stitches.
“Parama” : The shellfish Btrombus gigas,
known throughout the Pacific and Torres Strait as the
helmet shell, is one of
our univalve pearl-pro-
ducers. The pearl-s "are
rosy-pink, of great’-,
beauty, and fetch big
prices, though little
known in Australia.
The industry is carried
on in a fairly large
way in the Bahamas,
where the flesh is
considered a delicacy,
and the shells—which
run to about 51b.—
are shipped to the
American and Euro-
pean markets. Our
shells, found along
the Barrier Reef and

“Molokiki” (Papua): It is quite true that
natives are rarely attacked by sharks in Papuan
waters, although there is opportunity enough. When
a tragedy does occur the natives seem more con-
cerned over the fact that some shark has broken
the rules of the game than over the decease of
their mate. An indentured laborer was recently
“taken” off Wappa Reef, and an old native skipper
explained the position to me thus: “1 savvy that
old shark, taubada [master]. Long time he stop
along Bramble Cay, but this time he no got kai-
kai and he come find one boy along Wappa. All
the boys very wild with that shark, and supposing
Government tell me I go along Bramble Cay and
kill him. What you say?” In spite of the fact
that these waters teem with sharks the old fellow was
confident that he could identify the culprit.
HOLY GROUND.
COUSIN JACK (chapel steward): “Thee'st ’awe to find place some-
where else, stranger. This be mine-manager 's seat.”
“D.M.”: Tell “Lenah” (B. l/3/’23) that
there are bees indigenous to Australia known to
all bushmen as “native bees,” to distinguish them
from the descendants of the imported bees. They
are very tiny fellows, not as big as a housefly, and
quite stingless. They go through the same perform-
ances as other bees, and produce honey in the comb.
The quantity made in a season rarely exceeds a
quart; it is sweet, and at the same time pleasantly
acid.
* * * *
“Steele Post”: Potassium chlorate and
hydrochloric acid are exceptionally good as chlorine
producers, notwithstanding “R.P.O.’s” declaration
to the contrary (B. 15/2/'23), but, of course, the
expense of the chlorate prevents the commercial
use -of this mixture with a view to gassing ants,
as suggested by “X2X” (B. 25/l/’23). “R.P.0.”
■also says that after chlorine peroxide is formed
►by the double decomposition it is “oxidised by the
excess of acid.” Actually it is reduced by hydro-
chloric .acid, which is itself oxidised to water and
chlorine,-'and that is why the mixture is so effi-
cient —the -chlorine is liberated both from the
chlorate and the acid. Then “R.P.C.” says sul-
phuric .acid is- “stronger” than hydrochloric. On
the contrary again, for in equivalent solutions sul-
phuric is only 70, per cent, as strong. And if
he suggests the use \of sulphuric in place of the
other acid—well, strong sulphuric and potassium
chlorate evolve chlorine: peroxide very vigorously,
and that gas is a violent explosive. A friend in
my school days went very dose to losing the sight
of both of his eyes through experimenting with a
little of each in a test tube.

“A.W.8.” : Re “Ned Kelly” (B. 8/2/’23)
on the soldier-bird as an alarm sounder., The com-
mon crow is about the best fog* signal I You
can bet that when he gives the alarm there is-.always
some reason, and he never fails. Talking of s'dijlier-
birds, on a station out Maekinlay (Q.)
way, one of these birds calls and joins in the smoke-
oh by perching on the sugar-basin on the table
while the family are having a snack. He always
lands there on time. This little performance was
taught him by his mother before she was killed
by the house-cat.
* * * *
“Jesmond”: Re “Artifex’s” homing swan
(B. 22/2/'23). Friends of mine at Cowes (Vic.) took
three tame swans—two ladies and a gentleman-
back to the swanneries, 12 .miles away. A month
later one of the ladies was at their gate singing out
for her supper. Heaven only knows how she escaped
guns and foxes and found her way round many
netted paddocks, for her wings were cut close and
she must have waddled the whole distance.
“Sir Spen”: The neighbors had always
suspected that Spraggs cared more for his housemaid
than he did for his wife, and when Mrs. Spraggs
died and lie became wedded to the maid on the
following day they said “I told you so.” However,
that did not stop them from upholding the good
old custom of tin-kettling. They shook cowbells
and belted kerosene-tins vehemently for an hour or
so round about the Spraggs homestead, without any
response from the interior. Then at last the bride
put her head through the window and yelled: “Don t
jmr think yer makin’ it a bit ’ot? Why, yer oar n’t
ave any respeck for people’s feelings, considerin’ as
’ow we ’ad a funeral on’y yesterday.”
* * * *
“Nugget”: Tell “Buttinski” (B. l/3/’23)
that the Mark VII. ammunition for the .303 ser-
vice rifle gives a muzzle velocity of 2440 f.s. with a
charge of 38 grains oi
cordite as against the
2060 f.s. of the
Mark VI. with its
charge of 31 grains of
cordite. This extra
velocity is obtained
(a) by the use of a
heavier charge; (b)
by getting complete,
rather than rapid,
combustion of the
charge, hence the use
of tubular cordite in
the Mark VII. ammu-
nition ; (e) by getting
correct area of contact
between bullet and
barrel. If, as “But-
tinski” declares, vel-
ocity depended upon
rapidity of combus-
tion, then dynamite
would be an excellent
propellent. As a matter
of fact, it is not only
useless but positively
dangerous in this
capacity. “Buttinski”
is correct in saying
the bullet is forced
into the grooves of the
barrel. With the ser-
vice rifle, the dia-
meter of the base of
the bullet is ,008 in.
greater than the bore
of the rifle. Anyone
needing enlightenment
on the killing power
of ammunition should
compare the wound
made by a Webley
pistol bullet, of a
muzzle velocity of 640
f.s., with that made
by a high-velocity
missile. The latter
usually makes a neat
puncture, but the former smashes a pathway
through its victim that is not pleasant to look
upon and is certainly most effective as a knock-
out.

“Amyl”;. Tell “Toby C.” (B. 25/l/’23)
that at either the first cr second Malanda (N.Q.)
Show, Briggs Withers, working on a spring-board,
felled a tree and left a 75ft. stump to mark the
spot. Before finishing his job he cut places for his
hands and feet, and as the top was falling he left
his board and clung' to those places like grim death
to avoid being shaken off by the vibration.
“Pick”: On the western shore of Lake
George (N.S.W.) we caught a rabbit so emaciated
from starvation that he couldn’t get out of the way.
His upper front teeth had grown to 2J inches, and
were curved downward and inward, so that their
points w ere set hard against the angle of the lower
jaw. They effectually prevented the slightest open-
ing of the mouth, and how the poor devil had sub-
sisted with his tucker department so securely locked

was a mystery. AVe broke off the malformed tusks
and he painfully dragged his attenuated frame away.
I’ve seen only one other case like it, and what I
want to know is why such a perversion of nature
should have occurred only twice in the thousands
of bunnies I’ve handled.

THE MURRAY BOAT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the snows leave Kosciusko and the Indi takes
the rains,
When the Darling runs a banker and the floods are
on the plains,
Glad to quit the sluggish shallows where she
scarce had room to float,
Glad to feel the currents moving comes the eager
Murray boat.
Paddle-wheels, like wings beside her, drive her up
and bring her down,
Past the muddy Miirrumbidgee and the terraced
river town ;
Night and day she makes her running, pulling hard
against the stream,
Round the bends that double backward, by the
cliffs that redly gleam.
Stays she sometimes by Mijdarg. and the palm-trees
stand in line
Where the orange, golden-hearted, glows beside ‘tlie
sunny vine;
Or she sees cut west o’ Wentworth plains of drought
and thirst and sin,
Where the Darling meets the Murray and the salt-
bush lands begin.
Ghostly night-birds give her greeting from a white
and still lagoon
Softly touched with vagrant glory by the wonder
of the moon ;
And she passes where the gum-trees cast their
shadows lean and long
On the quiet of the waters in some flooded billabong.
Wheat and wool and fruit and timber she will gather
as she goes,
Bringing down the garnered treasure from the river
lands she knows ;
Not for her are schedules drafted—never early, never
late,
Coming, going, as it suits her, she can leave or she
can wait.
But when Kosciusko’s ridges arc all burnt by fire
and sun,
M hen the Indi rapids narrow and the mountain
rains are done,
When along the thirsty shallows she has scarcely
room to float,
Oh, she’ll find much time for resting, will the
weary Murray boat.
VICTORIA.

“The Overlander”: Along the road from
Hatch’s Creek (N.T.) via Wolfram Field to
Urandangie (Q.) at times there is a 130-mile stage
without water, between the A 1 Kedra and Bibbie’s
Creek, Lake Nash. It was tackled a couple of
times by bushmen, with horses, in the winter. They
just managed to struggle through, though it is only
a cake-walk for camels. The Murfanji (N.T.)
track, when the Murranji was dry, had a stage
of 110 miles, waterless grid scrubby, and was con-
sidered one of the toughest in Australia. Very
few tackled it (they preferred the coastal route),
and when they did they always had a full-moon.
Bores, however, will make this stretch easier for
future drovers. Another formidable stage was from
Goyder’s Lagoon, Diamantina River (Q.), to Kop-
THEN COARSE LANGUAGE FOLLOWED.
BELATED CARTER: “Fourteen miles ter the nex' pub
and only one match left to light our pipes with.
An’ are you sure that’s a good ’un?”
HIS FRIEND : “Oh, it strikes all right — I’ve just tried it!”
peramannie, Cooper’s Creek (S.A.), a distance cf
110 miles. Horses could get three drinks from
wells along the route, but the supply wasn’t sufficient
to water cattle. Yet only one disaster worth
considering happened on that track, and it was
caused through a duststorm which lasted two days.
No man could do anything with stock in one of
those storms. Drovers generally waited for a cool
southerly to spring up before tackling the trip ;
and some had to wait a fortnight. That thirsty
stretch has been broken by bores about every 30
miles for at least a couple of decades.
“The Deacon”: Can every horse swim ?
While some racehorses were being given swimming
exercise the other day at Leichhardt (Sydney), the
argument began among the boys. Some maintained
that every horse is a born swimmer, but others
as stoutly insisted that there are some steeds that
are neither born with nor can ever acquire the
knack. What’s the strength of it?
* * * *
“Shad Dow” : Anyone want a sure way of
poisoning foxes, and making certain of getting them?
Bore a hole in the ground, say with an ordinary
auger, a foot or so deep ; put something that smells
pretty high into the hole and poke it well down,
then cover with a chip and lay the poisoned bait
on top. When Reynard comes along he first eats
the bait, then, catching a whiff of whatever is in
the hole, he starts to dig, and so gives the poison
time to work. You can thus make a dead cert, of
getting him on the spot every time.
NO MATCH!
DORIS (as Daisy passes): “Dickie, I hear you didn't propose to Daisy, after all ?”
DICK: “No fear, and I don’t intend to! Why, the last time I popped up to her place
I found her chasing a mouse with a broom.”
“Dry Waters” : At Helen Springs station,
35 miles from Powell Creek (N.T.), an Afghan left
a newly-born camel calf with young Jack Bohning,
who reared it on goats’ milk. Humpy, as Jack
calls her, soon took to the milk, and before long
commenced to draw her supplies from the goat direct.
She now has two foster-mothers. The goat flock
numbers over 1000, and while it is being let out
of the yard Humpy waits at the gate for her
foster-mammas. When one of them comes along she
kneels down and has a drink, then ambles off to
the other, and finishes her breakfast. She accom-
panies the goats for about half-a-mile, but returns to
the homestead, and, when the flock comes in for a
drink at the creek at midday, Humpy goes to meet
them, picks out her two nannies, and has her lunch.
“S.C.”: Reynard, when intent on bird
prey', stalks his quarry in much the same fashion
as .the domestic tabby. I once
saw a fox, with ah eye on some
teal swimming in a swamp,
crouch on a stout horizontal
branch jutting out over the
water near the end of which the
teal were. Every time the
quarry ducked their heads under
in feeding Reynard moved slowly
along' the branch, stopping dead
still when their heads were above
water. Unfortunately just about
the time when the spring was
due, a stray rabbiter spotted the
fox and promptly tumbled him
off his perch with a charge of No.
2 shot. In another instance a
blue crane (white-fronted heron),
feeding about the margin of a
swamp, was Reynard’s objective,
the approach being similar, i.e.,
when the bird had its long neck
down in quest of tucker the fox,
stretched on its belly, crept
nearer. But man again inter-
vened. Reynard sniffed his arch-
enemy and promptly bolted.
“Tauwarra”: The practice of adopting
English names is becoming quite common amongst
some Papuan tribes. Brown Brother, after having
served a term as an indentured laborer, likes to
impress his envious and untravelled cobbers with
the fact that he is now “another kind man,” and
the first step in the process is to “throw away” a
perfectly good New' Guinea moniker in . favor of
some high-sounding and romantic “dim-dim” name,
such as “Cockroach,” “Dog-watch,” “Fish-line” or
“Pussy-cat.” In course of time, these names undergo
a process of change, and we then have “Kokolosi,”
“Doguasi,” “Pisilaini” and “Posikati” added to
the language. The missionaries further encourage the
amiable weakness by bestowing English front names
on their converts, and their choice is seemingly
restricted to Holy'Writ and the novels of the Jate
Mrs. Henry Wood. So you get Jeremiah Wadiara
and Lionel Tora-kai-ia, which are, after all, doubt-
ful improvements on “Leg-iron” or “Saucepan.” So
far, the little fad is doing no harm, except that it
exasperates the travelling tax-collectors ; but in years
to come it is safe betting there will be fierce argu-
ments among the native philologists and the aristo-
cratic birds who put forward claims of long descent.
“Chris”: How’s this for a kauri log? It
is 19ft. long, 18ft. lOin. in girth, contains about
5000 super-feet and weighs about 10 tons. It was
cut' five miles or so from the Waitakere (M.L.) rail-
way station, and taken to Goldie and Sons’ mill at
Auckland.
“M.F.”: Recent references to tree-felling
on spring-boards recalls the best climbing and fell-
ing feat I’ve seen. When the Mt. Lyell Co. was
hurrying along a light tram-line to take material
to the smelting works, the engineer-in-charge, after
completing a rather expensive bridge, noticed a
joint stringy-bark further up the hill hanging
directly over the structure. The question arose
how to remove the tree without destroying the
bridge, and Pat Welsh, a ganger, undertook the job.
He climbed 60ft. on spring-boards, then to ll'Oft.
by nailing on 3 x 1 pieces, and made fast the
end of a wire rope to the head of the tree. This
rope was fastened to the foot of another tree
further up the hill, and two axemen were told off to
fell the stri.ngy-bark. The latter, after tighten-
ing the rope, fell almost parallel with the tram-
line.
* * * *
“Colub”: As a general rule there is no
living thing freer from disease than the snake, but
occasionally he lands with a thud on the sick-list.
Llack, brown and tiger snakes have one complaint
in common, a disease which givys them greyish
patches all over their bodies, accompanied by a
desquamation of the scales, so that the latter become
detached, leaving raw-looking areas suggesting
physical injury. The complaint is a skin disease
of some kind, and, since it is epidemic, it is of
bacterial origin, though I have never heard of any-
body isolating the germ. Another illness from
which snakes sometimes suffer is characterised by a
semi-coma, somewhat akin to paralysis. The wriggler
afflicted with it may be poked with a stick, and
all he can do is to gaze wickedly at the poker
and rapidly flick. his forked tongue in and out. But
the lethargy apparently does not last for long. The
only time I came across a case—that of a full-
grown black snake —the sufferer was gone when I
returned the next day with a companion to see how
-he was getting on. Some years ago the director
■of an Australian Zoo, with the finest reptilian collec-
tion in the Commonwealth, informed me that snakes
were frequently stricken with this complaint in cap-
tivity, and he was inclined to attribute it to dietary
changes.
* ♦ •* *
“Edora” : I don’t know about the effect on
tree 3 of electric wires passing near them (B.
22/2/’23), but the effect of electric light can be
plainly seen on St. Ivilda-road, Melbourne. That
tree-planted boulevard has high electric arc-lamps,
and each silver poplar on which the light streams
retains its leaves green for two months after all
its unlighted neighbors have undressed themselves.
The branches nearest the light hold the leaves
longest. This will be particularly noticeable in
the next few (autumn) months.
“Morob”: At low tide on some of the
beaches in N.-E. New Guinea there is a curious
sand-crab that has venom glands. He looks like
the ordinary crab, but between his claws he has
a small, spine-like spike, from a quarter to half-
an-inch in length, and it is through this that he
injects the gland-secretion into his prey while hold-
ing the latter in his claws. 1 once saw a native
who had been “stung,” and, though it was more
than a year after the event, he still carried a
large suppurating sore just above his ankle, where
the spine had entered his flesh. From a description
of the action of the secretion, the chances are
that it belongs chemically to the same classifica-
tion as the secretion of colubrine snakes; that is,
apart from causing a general stupefaction of the
victim, it induces asphyxiation by paralysing the
end-plates of the phrenic nerve.
* » * *
.“A. Jocelyn”: I’ve got a fine collection of
hatters in my memory-museum, but my latest
sample beats ’em all. I found him in a little bark
hut tucked away in a lonely Gippsland (Vic.)
gully. He had all the uncommunicativeness of
his kind, but he shoved a pannikin of tea over to
me, and I sliced heartily into his damper and
wallaby. When he had finished his meal he filled
a tin-plate with sugar, and turned to the door
of the hut. There, crowding on the threshold,
was a mob of anything up to 150,000 ants, all
shapes, sizes and descriptions. They almost stood
on their hind legs and barked as the old codger
approached the door, but not one attempted to
enter. He placed the saucer outside, and the
feast lasted three minutes exactly. As I rode away,
I almost wished that hatters would talk some-
times ; but I don’t —their silence is their chief
charm.
* * * *
“F. Clinton”: Artesian bores in the nor’-
west of the Ma State are not an unadulterated
blessing. They attract birds, which settle around
them and deposit the seeds of prickly-pear off
which they have dined. In a brief time the pear
puts in an appearance and quickly spreads. This
has been particularly noticeable in the Pilliga Scrub,
where it is getting a stranglehold on one of the
few remaining natural pine belts in the State.
* * * *
“Tlie Rumpus” : It’s remarkable how the
sand of Westralia sustains its flora. Lately I rooted
out of my back yard a 40ft. red-gum, cutting through
the tap-root 7ft. down. At this depth the sand
was pure yellow crystals, without a trace of nutri-
ment. I even went to the trouble of washing a hand-
ful, and not a sign of discoloration resulted.
“Sucre”: An insurance inspector at Ayr
(N.Q.) owns a pet crocodile. It was presented to
him by an admiring fisherman, and takes up 6ft.
Sin. of his back yard when it’s asleep. There
isn’t a stray dog or a goat in the municipality now.
The Sydney police ought to borrow it to clean up
their thug-infested parks.
* * * *
“Birre Gurra” : There is a weed growing
round here (Blackall Range, Q.) which some
imaginative soul christened Prince of Wales Feather
on account of its white, fluffy flower, but is
known to the banana cockies as “blankety blank
wild radish.” It has a long radish-like root. In
almost every plant I have examined —and I recently
chipped six acres of the stuff —-I have found a small
white grub housed in and dining on the root. The
grub eats his way in through the tip of the root,
then works up through the centre, biting out the
heart of the vegetable as he goes. Yet the
plant flourishes, matures and scatters its seeds broad-
cast. Are there any other enterprising plants which
conduct a “residential and cafd” in their appen-
dages, and suffer no apparent damage therefrom?
* * * *
“Panfagruel” : On Connor’s River (Q.) a
snarer has, in the last five years, bagged
60,000 wallaby skins. This sounds highly im-
probable, working out as it does at about 23
skins every day in the year; but it is vcjiched for
by the manager of Lotus Creek station, through
which Connor’s River runs. The manager, who
acted as receiver, says there are millions of wal-
labies left in the district, notwithstanding that
dozens of snarers get thousands of skins every year.
SPOTTED.
THE DETECTIVE: “It looks as if the Handi-
cap will he a good betting race. Any-
thing might have a chance, eh?”
SPORTING TORACCONIST: “Yes, anything—
except you and the sergeant.”
“H.S.K.”: I saw near Manjimup (W.A.)
a week or two ago a freak in the way of a brown cocka-
too. When flying it could easily be mistaken for
a brown hawk. Closer examination, while it helped
a mob of black cockatoos to strip the bark from a
dead jarrah, revealed that the back of its head and
two-thirds of its tail, from the tip up, were white,
all the rest of it being brown. It had the hooked
cockatoo beak, and must have been a cross between
a black and a white. Has a similar apparition
been seen anywhere else ?
IN A WESTERN CATCHING PEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The drafting gates are banging,
And a summer haze is hanging
Round a yard just slung together underneath a
scorching sun.
We are wethering and tailing,
Holding lambs up on a railing,
In a hell of fashioned hurdles which the wiser
“bagmen” shun.
In the rags we’re ever mending,
We are gripping and upending
Panting sheep, and we are bathed in blood and
dust and human ooze,
With a sea of wool surrounding,
And a mingled bleating pounding
On our scanty blot of reason as we bog in and
abuse
A raw jackeroo who’s swinging
Careless gates, a ditty singing—
Oh, the ewes are streaming through, and we must
lift ’em out again!
We have cursed him (under cover),
With the father and the mother
Who would rear a boss’s “pink eye” for a western
catching pen.
There’s a tarboy dabbing, splashing,
And a cutter splitting, slashing,
And his dripping blade upturning seems at times
the one release;
But the cow, if he should blunder,
We would call the fiends from under
To come up the scorching bore-pipe and be in at
his decease.
Sc we swelter through the marking,
Cursing mongrels ever barking,-
And we’ll booze and bet on tallies, of the hours
in the pen ; •
And all doubters we’ll be hurting,
AVhile with i’antods we are flirting,
Till we tramp and “sight a redlight” for a share
of it again.

Pleasant company, a good car shod with depend-
able tyres, and what an amount of enjoyment
one can cram into a motor tour extending over a
few days! No more ideal way of spending one's
holiday exists. Variety and charm await one in
every direction. The noise of the multitude may
be left behind as one gets out amongst the gums,
or the gayer doings at the seaside may be added
to the pleasure of one’s outing. The freedom of
being able to go when and where one likes is in
itself a great legacy to motorists. One essential
to pleasurable touring is that you start away on
tyres capable of withstanding hard service with-
out giving trouble. The safest thing to do is to
fit your car or motor cycle with “Railroad”
D
u
□
and thereby ensure immunity from roadside tyre
troubles. The quality and strength of "Railroads”
are never more apparent than under touring
conditions. Thousands of miles of travel, over
all descriptions of roads and tracks, leaves little
sign of wear on “Railroads.” This is the service
built into every “Dunlop” cover and tube, and
it is to be had simply by specifying “Dunlop”
when ordering tyres. The cost is no more —in
fact, less—than most imported tyres; the dif-
ference is in the economical service they give.

Many a Digger, and many a Digger’s
mother, will have a kind thought for the
widow of the ex-banker T. A. Dibbs in her
black sorrow. She was 75 and he seven years
older when Australia began to feel some of
the wounds of war. The large family that
had grown up at Graythwaite had scattered;
so the old home was handed over for the
use of sick and shattered soldiers, and, staffed
chiefly by Voluntary Aids, who had the same
fine spirit of patriotic service, it became and
remains one of the finest things the Great
Horror produced in Australia.
Queen-street, Redfern, is utilitarian rather
than gracious. It is narrow and curving and
its pavement is rough—distinctly it is not
the place where one would expect to find a
deferred hope shyly blooming. Yet the Silk
Culture Society called it blessed last week,
for in it, after many years’ work, the first
silk looms in Sydney were set whirring. The
Silk Culture Society is a small band of en-
thusiasts who have pinned their faith to the
cocoon and the mulberry-leaf for decades
past; their forerunner was an Annie Perry,
of Victoria, who as far back as IS4O tried
to make a good Australian out of the im-
ported silkworm. Simon Hickey, ex-M.P.,
is the managing director of the venture,
which is called the Australian Silk Mills,
Ltd. His Ex. and Dame Margaret dropped
in from Sutton Forest to bless the opening,
and to mention (S’Walter did it) that the
lady had gone in for the culture of the
cocoon. Attorney-General Bavin, Aubrey
Halloran and the Mayor of Waterloo
dropped speeches into the hat; the low-ceil-
inged room throbbed with closely-packed
humanity, while listless bunting drooped
motionless over a buffet piled with tea-urns
and perspiring eatables, and the roses in
Dame Margaret’s bouquet yawned fragrantly
in the hot air.
Phyllis Harwood, bent on matrimony, beat
Nancy Kiss to the altar of St. Mark’s by
three hours last week, and at four of the
clock annexed architect Fred Deane, of
Double Bay, as her keeper for life. Phyllis
was an unconventional bride, topping her
ivory-toned brocade frock with a black panne
hat that was thickly thatched with ospreys,
and carrying an armful of red roses to the
altar steps. The frock was one of those no-
fastener, wriggle-into things, draped on clas-
sic lines and adorned with a betasseled old-
time gold buckle. One autumn-tinted brides-
maid, with a bouquet of blue delphiniums
brightening up the leaf-brown frocldng, fol-
lowed the bride. The wedding-party was
held in the Harwood flat in the Kingsclere
eyrie, where Mrs. Harwood hostessed in
navy georgette and lace, supported by the
bridegroom’s mother in nigger-brown silk.
Nancy Kiss, George Kiss’s tall, lovely
daughter, ascended the stone steps to St.
Mark’s one evening last week, and descended
them* Mrs. Alec Mac-neil. Canon Howard
Lea was the intermediary. The bride was
classically draped in ivory velvet, buckled
with chenille and ermine. She smiled
through plain tulle beneath a coronet of
orange blossoms, and hugged an armful of
lilies. Nell Charley and Bertha Scott, in
cyclamen velvet frocks, with silver-lace
berthas and veils and pink roses for nosegays,
looked, like bridesmaids from an 1830 wed-
ding picture. Gordon Brady and Ken Hardie
escorted them to the church, and afterwards
to the Australia, where the cake was cut.
The young Alec Macneils will make their
home on Glenburnie station, one of the
numerous family holdings.
Yvonne Aurousseau last week • gave the
Merrymakers the best thrill they have en-
joyed since the days of their amateur enter-
taining for war funds. She became engaged
on Tuesday, married on Wednesday, and
steamed away on Thursday to her new home
in America. The bridegroom, Harry Cushin
Raven, met Yvonne three weeks before he
decided that he couldn’t cross the Pacific
without her. It was a business getting-
through the preliminaries—securing a pass-
port and a passage on the Maunganui, fixing
up the register, and gathering a trousseau —
but the trite old adage, “All the world loves
a lover,” still carries some heavy guns.
Everybody did everything to help the scientist
,—he is Entomologist-in-Chief at the Museum
of Natural History, New York, and has been
here on research work with Dr. Gregory’s
expedition. The Water Board Millners were
at the impromptu luncheon at Farmer’s, Mrs.
Millner being the bride’s aunt. The bride
has a deep sympathy with hubby’s job; her
brother Marcel, who earned an M.C. and
other distinctions during the war, is one of
our champion young scientists. He was
lecturer in geology at the Perth University
before he was appointed to a job at Wash-
ington (U.S.A.) University. He will be
in New York to welcome little sister to her
new homeland. Yvonne’s grandfather was
French, and her husband lias a French an-
cestry. His only two brothers were killed
in the war, and possibly he was only saved
because he was detained in the Celebes by
the Dutch when war broke out. The only
wedding presents were cheques.
Hymen is hovering around the American
Consulate, and the golden lasso will soon be
slipped over Miss Campbell, -who rules over
the outer office of the Consulate.
Josef Kretschman —no need yet to more
than recall the kindly old Bohemian to
whom musical Sydney of a generation back
owed more than it could ever pay. His
memory dwells affectionately with many of
his old pupils; and they wish to provide
something in the way of a permanent
memorial. Miss Valda Kersey and Miss
Edith Ford are arranging for a discussion
over the teacups at the Navy and Army
tearooms on April 7; meantime anyone of
Kretschman’s admires wishing to join in
may communicate with them at Paling’s.
Gerardy, the Belgian ’cellist, who is at
the moment of writing within hailing dis-
tance of Sydney, has his wife with him on
the Makura. She was a daughter of the late
Harry McQuade, of Potts Point.
Birds will be birds. “Mr. Sparrow, secre-
tary of the , who op the completion of
25 years’ service lias been granted six months’
leave of absence, was entertained by the
staff. Accompanied by Mrs. Swallow- he
sailed by the on Saturday on a trip to
Europe.” So the S. M. Herald said, any-
way.
Mrs. Maelurcan dropped into Sydney again
last week after another dash across the
Pacific. In shipping circles there’s an idea
she’s trying to outdo Frank Coffee. Any-
way, the staff of the hotel gave three cheers
and a rose show to indicate their approval
of her return. Incidentally, is it accident
or design that places so many beautiful
Titian heads amongst the waitresses of the
big white and cold caf6?
Another Australian gets a look-in among
the London medicoes—Dr. L. S. Woods, lately
of Albury, who has been appointed house
surgeon to the West London Hospital. His
residence in England dates only from the
beginning of the year. A brother has .his
plate in Goulburn.
The lady of the picture is Sister Elizabeth
McMillan, daughter of knight William, and
until the other day
matron of Tresillian,
the Baby Welfare
Home. Since the
fiare-up between her-
self and the Royal
Welfare Society the
enthusiastic sister
has been carrying on
the good .work of
teaching mothercraft
at the Y.W.C.A.
rooms in Post-office
Chambers. That will
be her address till
the formation of the
projected N.S.W.
branch of the Plun-
ket Society. Sister
Elizabeth learned
her job in London,
under the wing, as
it were, of Maoriland’s ex-Governqr’s Indy,
who gave her name to the society, and
thought so much of it that she launched a
school to teach Truby King’s methods in Lon-
don. The delightful old specialist was per-
suaded to leave his other hobby, Seacliff, for
long enough to set things working smoothly
in the interests of England’s babies.
There was a great gathering of Roy
Agnew’s friends and admirers in Paling’s
concert hall the other night, when it was
decided to open a testimonial fund for the
purpose. of sending the indefatigable young
man with his 57 unpublished works to
Europe. This is not with the idea of rid-
ding Australia of them, but with the hope
that they may come back multiplied in pub-
lished form. Roy has already a list of
published compositions to his credit. In
voicing the appeal, Arundel Orchard, presi-
dent. of the Sydney Centre of the British
Musmal Association, pointed out that for
the first time Australia was trying to send
one of her own composers to Europe. Ruth
Beale and Ruby Barton are secretaries, and
Mrs. de Beaupuis (whose husband regarded
Roy as his most brilliant pupil) and Miss
Roseby (Kambala) will look after the
treasury. It is hoped that Justice Gor-
don’s musicianly wife will be pres’dent.
Romance has the queerest hiding-places.
In Sydney a few years ago a man who was
generally thought to be as hard as steel
was winding up the affairs <sf a bank—Syd-
ney’s last big winding-up—and doing it,
people said, ruthlessly. A visitor had to
see him about a tough business matter, and
when they had settled it flintily the hard
man said “Now we can both relax.” And
from under his blotting-pad he produced a
slip of paper. “This is w’hat I’m doing,”
he said —“I know you’re interested in such
things,” and passed it over. It was a half-
finished tender little poem. Silver-haired
W. H. Whiddon, who assesses and collects
the State taxes in N. S. Wales —well, you
know what an ogre he must be. Yet when
he leaves his biood-sucking establishment
and doesn’t take home a case-full of docu-
ments to assist him in further blood-sucking,
he turns to music and composition. In
these days he doesn’t often make a public
appearance; but last week adjudicator E.
P. Truman put a little thing of his in the
finals in a competition that is being held
in Manly.
Herewith artist Ethel Stephens, who, after
being absent from Sydney for three years,
received a cable on
the voyage back tell-
ing her she had been
elected president of
the Society of
Women Painters.
Miss Stephens,, who
wasa pioneer of the/
Arts’ and Crafters,
was the guest of
honor at a party
given by them the
other day, when she
was almost over-
powered by the
grandeur of the so-
ciety’s new rooms.
Her travels have
taught her to deplore
the ultra-modern, and
to prize sincerity and
poetry in art more
than ever. She exhibited in 1921 and 1922
with the Paris Salon, and plans a one-
woman’s show for August.
Ted Beeby has just applied to be put on
the roll of solicitors. He ought to know a
bit about the business —his father, the indus-
trial judge who for>years practised as a gent,
one, gave him his early training. Two
knighted Josephs, Cook and Carruthers, also
have sons knocking for admission.
William James has been engaged as solo
pianist for the Stella Powers concert season.
He has already played at the Albert Hall
and on the Powell International Celebrity
tours, and his song compositions are
beginning to catch on abroad.
What will probably be one of Manly’s
most striking homes has been designed for
ex-English soldier Gilbert Nobbs. It’s to be
pure Georgian, and its site one of the Vil-
lage's headlands. Nobbs is a striking figure.
Slim, erect and a vivid talker, he rides,
jazzes and plays golf equally well, and man-
ages the Australian end of Holbrook’s; yet
he emerged from the Western Front totally
blinded. Incidentally, last year’s business
of the Australian branch is alleged to have
beaten that of the parent house in England.
It sounds like pluck through and through.
“The Hordernians,” the weighty name
under which the members of Anthony Hor-
derns’ social and athletic club labors, took
200 small girls and boys to Yarra Bay on
Saturday afternoon, and Darlinghurst-square
was one wide smile. The Hordernians smiled
as they lifted smiling mites into the seven
motor-lorries, or tucked a few into the car
of a departmenta-1 head; the onlookers smiled
to see the kids’ happiness; the drivers smiled
to know they had given their half-holiday in
such a cause. The youngsters didn’t leave
much of the feast that had kent the big firm’s
kitchen going all the morning. One mite put the
returned thanks aptly. “My word, Mister,”
he said, as he was lifted down at the home
destination. _ “Yous and the ladies is good
blokes all right. I’m puttin’ yous in me
Gord-blesses ter-night.”
Poetess Dora Wilcox makes confession
I could never see any beauty in Australian land-
scapes until I’d had a trip to Europe. When I first
came over from Maoriland I thought there wasn’t
any color in the Bush, and hated its monotony, and
the hard blue sky up above, and the hard earth,
baked yellow, underneath. But a few months in
Italy taught me a lot; and when I got to England my
eyes, accustomed to grey-green and brown symphonies
of olive and ilex, found something too obvious, too
rank, in the aggressive green of the land of our
forebears, charming though it is. And now I’m
never tired of looking at the subtlety of color in the
Bush, the velvety quality of shadow in contrast with
the sunlight (which you never get in misty coun-
tries—not that fog and haze have not charm of
their own) and the patterns made by the gum-trees
against the sky. And, strange to relate, I spend quite
a lot of time trying to teach Australians to see
what I’ve learned to see for myself—the beauty of
their native land.
Scarba, one of the places that put the true
stamp of benevolence on the Benevolent So-
ciety, was very gay on Saturday. Chief
Justice Cullen’s lady opened a fete organised
by the Women’s Auxiliary to raise the money
for installing electric light in the home where
mother can ieave Tommy and Dolly in good
care while little brother or sister arrives.
Sixty pounds—l 2 hundred shillings—will
equip the City Mission with enough money
to supply thousands of the children of the
mean streets with a hot cross bun on Good
Friday, and it calls upon all its friends to
drop a coin in the hat that the kiddies won t
be disappointed. 276 Elizabeth-street is the
address.
St. Vincent's Ball is resolving itself into
a paper-poster affair —the living adyts. for
the different firms must clothe their ideas in
paper costumes. Prizes, are offered for the
most artistic and original and for the least
expensive outfit. Unfortunately, Airs.
Toohey, who is president of the committee,
has had to fly to Bowral from the mad ex-
citement of meetings owing to a bad cold.
Dr. Langloh Johnston, as usual, pays the
rent of the Town Hall for the night of
nights; and Josephine Marks is unloading
some good - poster ideas that should net big
money.
The pick of the Hardy Wilson collection
at Anthony Horderns’ is a Queen Anne red
lacquer cabinet. It’s a cheery piece, and
would be specially inspiring on a dull winter
afternoon. There are two blackbutt or black-
wood “Colonial” chairs, very comfortable
and so solid that a woman could scarcely
lift them, let alone throw them at the Brute.
The yachting Alberts were in the last
batch of migrating Australians.
gave an afternoon dance-party at the Went-
worth as a final flutter to her friends, and
each guest got a souvenir in the shape of a
silver boomerang—incidentally, the brand of
the family’s best-selling mouth-organs.
They’re the music-shop Alberts, you know.
Broken Hill has had another strike, but
Judge Edmunds won’t be called in to settle
this one. It has settled itself. With the
temperature rising past 100 for days and
days, the gents, who go to Jazzland decided
that the ladies were having too much the
best of it. They could strip to the waist or
thereabouts, and wear a film of silk and no-
thing much else from the ground floor to
the first storey. So an ultimatum was handed
in, and next night the order was posted:—
Gentlemen may discard coats if wearing white
SHIRTS AND BELTS.
And the threatened insurrection was over.
The shingle of the ultra-Bohemian Cafede
Bohhme is to be shifted shortly from the old
lane where it has long hung; and it is not
certain yet where it will be rehoisted. No
Sydney Bbhemian is quite a Bohemian unless
he has visited the somewhat frowsy “joint”
at least once; and it is a regular haunt of
many, from 1.W.W.-ers to the newest vert
lihre poet. Its spaghetti is its saving grace.
An unconventional Sydney couple whose
home looks down upon one of our best-
beloved beaches invited friends to a “mid-
night supper, dance and breakfast” the
day, and the uncommon frivol was voted a
great success. The revellers of the small
hours changed their dancing rig to surfing
smalls with the coming of dawn, and trailed
down to the surf to enjoy a dip when it
tastes best. Tea and coffee were brought to
the beach, and the surfers were driven back
for breakfast. When they woke up late on
Sunday afternoon they had a comfortable
memory of a great good time.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Our presiding social deity has been tied to his
bachelor’s bed. However, he is beginning to look
over the rim of the social whirlpool again, and
will presently steam into its giddy waters.
Under the appraising eye of Humphrey Bishop
and Billy Maloney, at Cremorne, a beauty competi-
tion is in progress. Brisbane’s pretty girls are being
run to earth without mercy.
The Whittinghams are back from the Cold Country,
and Mayfield is expected to be once again a “merry
May.” It is only a year ago, love, since they left
for Europe.
The Q.W.E.L. welcomed Mrs. Cowan, M.L.A., with
yellow flowers and pale-blue ribbons to prove there
was nothing socialistic about them. It happened in
the Botanic Gardens tea-house; and after Mrs.
M. B. E. Anderson and Mrs. Life-president A. .1.
Thynne had handed out luncheon and amenities, a
rush was made for Parliament House, where mere
male Parliamentarians provided tea. With a*proper
Sense of solemnity of the occasion the Judges
added more tea—at Finney’s roof garden. Among
the legislators Father-of-the-House Andrew' Petrie
bared his silver head and made appropriate remarks.
Brain and beauty applauded. The teacups were
washed up again for the morning when.the Women’s
Club donned its wedding garment for the West-
ralian visitor. Rhoda Felgate recited Essex Evans’s
“Women of the West,” and Grace Gordon lifted up her
voice and sang. The 16th speeded the parting
giuest.
Morgan Lane, the south-side medico and, inci-
dentally, the new president of the Irish Club, has
brought back a bride to his home at Gladstone-road.
When he flew from Queensland recently, A. 11.
Chisholm seems to have packed a heart in his’ suit-
case along with his camera and his bird-notes. His
engagement to Miss Hazier, niece of the late Jack
Cain, is mentioned now. Jack Cain’s widow, by the
wav, has acquired Lennon’s, in George-street, for
£57,000 with one hand, while with the other she
has passed over the Royal to Anderson, of the
Oriental, for £50,000. This is how we “think in
millions” at a few hours’ notice.
Tennis was played as a farewell to the Dave
Hamiltons at Mrs. Ridgway’s. The Glyn-Connellvs
and Cecil Palmers were among the guests. Mrs.
Hamilton got in her tea a day or two earlier.
Melbourne claims them in future.

Acting-Premier McPherson motored down
to Port Melbourne to welcome the Stanleys,
but the Orvieto was in half-an-hour earlier
than he expected, and the Stradbrokes had
whisked off the former Governor and his
dame to Government House. However, he
greeted them later, and invited former Excel-
lency Sir Arthur to the Cabinet’s farewell
luncheon to our Earl, which is to occur a
day or so before the Narkunda leaves Mel-
bourne.
Norman Carter lunched with the Strad-
brokes soon after he arrived in Melbourne
from Sydney, and enlisted the interest of
Herself in the coming London exhibition of
Australian art. There was a meeting for
the cause at Government House last week,
with the indefatigable Tommy Cochran as
hon. sec., and great things are expected of the
Countess when she gets to England. Norman
Cartel-, by the way, is a Melbourne man. A
son of the late H. R. Carter, a grain broker,
he was educated at Melbourne Grammar-
School, and received his first instructions in
drawing from his paternal grandfather.
Lady Stanley, looking very fit in a cinna-
mon silk-knitted frock, held quite a levee
during the afternoon, and the Cresswell
dame, Hr. Deeper, Dr. Bage, Bernard Hall
and Mrs. Donald Mackinnon (who owns
artist Rupert Bunny as brother) all ex-
pressed jntere’st in the scheme. The amount
aimed at is £2OOO.
The Stanleys were at the Stonington meet-
ing which considered the extension of the
ambulance service to country districts. Sir
Arthur said that his experience on the
Migration Board in England had taught him
how necessary the ambulance service in
country districts was. When interviewing
intending settlers he found that they filing
hundreds of questions at him —many of them
as to the proximity of doctors, chemists and
so forth. When told that such amenities
might be. 40 or 50 miles away their faces
fell, and they usually ceased to be intending
settlers on the spot. The indefatigable
James Barrett knight, who is a prime mover
in the scheme, was supported by Senator
Guthrie, Mrs. Crocker, Miss R. ou-rrie and
others; and ambulance Chief-Superintendent
Cannon gave his opinion as to the cost of
maintenance. The Government is to be
asked to help, and for once in a way the most
bloated members of the employing class and
the Trades Hall will meet on common
ground.
Vera de Bavay had a final hop on Thurs-
day night in honor of Peggy Forrester and
Fon Ellison. It occurred at the parental
mansion, and Mrs. de Bavay lent a helping
hand. The hostess wore her best jazz frock
of green and silver stripes, with cherries
bobbing redly in her dark locks and along
her waist-line ; her sister Marie was in pink
and silver, and their mother affected jetted
black hangings. Peggy Forrester featured
dusky satin and tulle, and Fonnie Ellison
sunset pink. Mrs. Leslie Stewart, who, with
her elder chick Nanette, is off to see what
Colombo can do for her bronchial disability,
was there with her brace of flappers.
At her marriage the other day to Dr.
Colin Chisholm Ross, in Melbourne Gram-
mar School chapel, Gwynneth Morrice Wil-
liams wore clouds of pink georgette, cur-
tained with rosy lace, and topped by a black
velvet picture-hat. Bridesmaid Gladys,
Wiltshire, who, like the ’groom, comes from
Sydney, sported pale-blue georgette under
an inky hat. The bride’s father, who is
one of the oldest inhabitants of the school
council, gave her away; and her brother
Clive was best man. The school chaplain
officiated, and the inevitable jollo occurred
at the Williams home in Or'rong-road.
Gwynneth fled to the going-away car through
a barrage of rose petals, wearing grey tailor-
ings under a toquelet in jade-gfeen and
black.
Mrs. Nor grove Clutterbuck has sent out
gold-lettered invitations to an evening affair
at St. Colomb’s Church in Glenferrie next
Monday week, when her daughter Viola pro-
poses to exchange vows with Ernest Guyett.
The usual provisions will be consumed at
Glen Norge, Malvern.
Lauri Staughton had hardly finished her
Continental education when she met one
Cautley Shaw, a dashing young Dragoon
Guardsman, and Cupid did the rest. The
youth is now planting tobacco and oranges
in Rhodesia, while the A. J. StaughtOns’
pretty daughter is in Melbourne, trousseau-
hunting.
Editli (Lansell) Norbury, having returned
from her overseas honeymoon, is settling in
her newlv-purchased home at South xaii.i.
Bendigo,‘ where dad made his pile, tears
that it has lost her for ever.
Julius Knight has returned wearing his
GO years with all the aplomb of the original
Super bus. A man who returned with him
on the Orvieto mentions that the veteran
was the ehayipion in handling the huge “medi-
cine ball,” kept on liners for strong men to
toy with. Julius is staying at Menzies’, and
at the slightest provocation he grows lyrical
in several languages over the genius of Irene
Vanbrugh. The Vanbrugh lady, who has
been annexed by the Firm, has stivoir faire,
joie de vivre, raison d’etre, and much else;
but Julius fears that her art may be too
subtle for the people that rush shows like
“The Bat.”
Those who have scanned the heavy, forth-
right features of faith-healer Hickson will
hardly believe that lie won a beauty competi-
tion many years ago. It happened at a
charity fair at Newcastle (N.S.W.), and
each competitor had to part up a guinea,
the winner getting a laurel wreath or some-
thing of the sort. Hickson was not called
on to extend himself. In fact, one glimpse of
his unparalleled loveliness was enough for
the doting maidens who voted, and the vet-
diet was almost unanimous. HickSoh had
more than a passable tenor in his youth,
and his melting tones at the outbreaks of
sundry Liedertafels frequently helped to swell
the gate.
The Roy Lister widow, who helped Pat
O’Hara Wood to win the mixed doubles in
the M.C.O. contests, had to scratch for the
ladies’ singles—for which she had been tipped
as a certain winner—owing to an appendi-
citis attack. She is now convalescent, much
to the joy of her four-year-old kiddie, who
wore a weepy look for days.
Melba’s newest protegee, Wilma Berkeley,
is not going to the Nellie Rowe School of
Music, after all. She is working at the
moment in London with our own Anne Wil-
liams, preparatory to going under a famous
voice-specialist in Paris.
Ponderous William Henry Laird Smith,
ex-M.H.R., ex-Minister of the Navy, and so
on, is about to bid his native Speck farewell.
After his defeat at the recent elections he
started to settle down on a, nice little farm
which he owns. But it didn’t appeal to the
fairly-affluent Mrs. Laird Smith: and so
what could the poor man do but come to
this State?
Nurse Dorothy Bridges, daughter of the
Bridges lady (who, by the way, is rusticat-
ing at Etham), is making quite a “do” of
the Brunswick Nursing Home, w r hich she
started a little qver a year ago. So much
so that she is now looking out for a surgi-
cal partner. Babies being so fashionable,
she .finds the work too much for one person.
Theodore Fink saw the Herald safely into
its new building and then joined Frank Tate
on the Ormonde. The other London-bound
passengers should find things cheery in their
neighborhood. Each has a vast fund of
anecdote, and accepts the dictum of Walpole
that such things should be distributed un-
grudgingly.
This is a Rembrandt photo of Mrs. Brodie
Ainslie, who, as vice-president of the Women’s
Hospital committee, is doing great staff work
in the campaign
which has been
launched on behalf
of the new building
fund. Since the
battle began she
has personally im-
prisoned over £BOO.
This she did by ex-
hibiting the Herald
beauties’ pictures in
the Athenaeum Hall,
the newspaper heads
having lent her the
photographs. But the
tinal push will be on
Button Day, which
is due to rage at the
end of the month.
For 22 years this
kindly matron has
helped the hospi-
tal as a committee woman, and for several
of those years she has sat in the presi-
dential chair. This is her second term of
office as vice-president.
The McEacharn lady’s sister, Mrs. John
(who, by the way, was wearing a coat of
Norwegian cormorants’ feathers, said to be
worth £1000), stepped off the Themistocles
on Monday. Each year Mrs. John, who was
one of the Bendigo Watsons, makes a pil-
grimage to her son’s grave in France, which
is the sacred charge of a Belgian widow,
for whom she has generously provided. A
sympathetic thought has prompted her to
try to get into touch with those not so for-
tunately placed to whom sbg may bring
news and photos of their dear ones’ resting-
places.
Norman Bayles has let his Toorak place
to Colonel and Mrs. Willie Robertson (she
is Lady Grey Egerton’s sister) for a couple
of years. Mrs. Bayles is going to settle her
son Teddy Neill at Oxford and his sister
Avleth at a Blighty school. The Robert
Whitings are also off. They will join then*
two married daughters in England ; also then-
elder girl, Mrs. Walker, and her Indian-
officer husband are crossing the seas to
meet them.
This is a Shier’s photo of Dr, Georgina
Sweet, who was dined by her friends the
other night at the Lyceum Club in celebra-
tion of her return
from foreign travel.
She and Jessie Webb
journeyed ,to Cape-
town, and thence
overland to Cairo, in
the belief that they
were the first two
women to undertake
the trip. She had
many tales to tell
the dinner-party. In
the south of S’Africa
the two travellers
were shown over the
pick of the ostrich-
farms, including the
one that supplied
over 100 of the 1000
feathers in Princess
Mary’s wedding gift.
Perhaps it was on
account of the ostriches that Dr. Georgina
suffered much discomfort in S’Africa —dis-
comfort of the kind which kept her thinking
yearningly of somebody’s powder.
Clarence Weber’s annual show at the
Town Hall drew a crowded house, compris-
ing pretty well every physical culturist in
Melbourne, and Lieut.-Governor Irvine. The
piece de resistance was the tableau “Triumph
of Love,” impersonated by Mr. and Mrs.
Clarence and their protesting little daughter
Shirley. It was noted with gloom that the
Culture Girls had donned longer skirts than
hitherto.
Melbourne is trying a new cure for shop-
lifting. One bright young Society klepto-
maniac, faced with the alternative of arrest
or a compulsory visit to a photographer,
chose the latter. Her charming profile was
then taken at various angles, and the results
were distributed amongst those emporiums
likelv to be honored with her patronage
She'had the pleasure of pay ng the photo-
grapher’s bill.
Hugh Ward’s after-the-show ball in cel-
ebration of the hundredth night of “The
O’Brien Girl” was a stunning affair. Sup-
per was set in a scene dock, beautifully
camouflaged to represent a dining-hall of
softs, and the cold turkey was served up at
tables parterred with flowers. While the
performers were getting off their grease-
paint Hugh Ward, backed by Ben and John
Fuller, staged a pleasing cocktail curtain-
raiser in the foyer. Here Jennie Brenan
and her sister Eileen had a lot of the lime-
light. They are just back from a sprint
round the globe, in quest of the latest trot
steps. Mamie Watson O’Brien suggested an
ode to Spring in shimmery lilac silkiness,
with a shirred waist-line and floating
sleeves; June Roberts wore black patched
with beaded floral squares; May. Beattie was
a vast and agreeable expanse of blue and
silver tissue, with her head bandaged to
match; Mark Daly’s real wife, Ena Dale,
twinkled sunnily in golden brocade; Gladys
Moncrieff brought a black frock and her
new fiance: Herbert Flemming had his wife
with him; Nellie Bramley smiled her sweet-
est in delicate mauve hangings, with her
husband, Billy Russell, as escort; Mrs.
Grossmith’s fairness was heightened by a
silky setting whose hues seemed to have
been torn from the sky ; Eve Gray fluttered
like a rosy cloud in pink, and Sylvia Shaw,
her fellow-star in “Bulldog Drummond,” was
attractive in black, though silver leaves
bunched round the hair-clusters that muffled
her ears suggested that she had forgotten to
lay off her curl-papers. Oscar Asche gloomed
in the offing, and Julius Knight, a trifle
greyer and two trifles plumper than of old,
blew in from his box at “Chu Chin Chow,’
and from an uproarious welcome at the
hands and feet of his friends in the gods.
Mrs. Ricnard Stewart rushed across from.
Sydney last week on hearing thht her preci-
ous Mione had been driven from “A Southern
Maid” cast with a poisoned eye. Some of the
young woman’s dark make-up did the dam-
age, but it was only transitory. :On Tues-
day the pair spread a cheery tea-party in the
Oriental lounge, the invalid wearing an all-
brown scheme, with a feathery pompon on
the port bow of her hat, while Mrs: Dick was
a study in black brightened by the silvery
rays of her front locks.
Teachers at Camberwell’s classiest school
were horrified the other day when one small
girl, in describing the English Civil War,
wrote: “The Civil War took place in 1644,
featuring Oliver Cromwell ” Yet there are
those who say the influence of the movies is
negligible.
A postcard from Florence, signed by Dr
Connie Ellis, Mrs. Barden and Madame Bal-
lara, and bearing the Coudish “Eyery day in
every way we grow younger and younger,”
seems to show that the trio of brainy Mel-
bourne women are not letting the grass grow
under their tootsies. Dr. Ellis expects to
return to London about April, and will make
a round of the hospitals to pick up the
newest tips on cutting people up.
Sir Alfred Piekford, the Great Cham or
Colossus of Boy Scouts, opened the Our Big-
Effort Festival at Brighton. The Town
Clerk, who organised the Festival, hopes to
rake in enough funds to build a Scout Hall,
where the scoutlets can hang up their, cow-
boy hats and rest their knobby knees. Any-
thing left over is to furbish up the Brighton
Beach Cricket ground, close to the golden
sands on which lovers leave innumerable
smashed chocolate boxes and cigarette but-ts
for remembrance. Mrs. Walter Gill is run-
ning a dream of a tearoom, assisted by
attendant sprites garbed in white punctuated
with black velvet bows.
A recent bride who resides in an outer
suburb pinned a note to her front door ask-
ing an expected visitor to come to the side
door, as she was busy making jam. Time
passed. Suddenly the jam-maker, hearing
a noise, leaped to her bedroom just in time
to see a woman’s skirt disappearing out of
the window. Now the poor bridelet is mourn-
ing all her pet traycloths, most of her
glory-box treasures and a mass of silver-
ware. It is an additionally bitter reflection
that she practically invited the lady burglar
to come in and help herself,
Toorak’s few remaining squattorial pal-
aces are gradually being shoved on the
auction block, and, in open defiance of the
domestic help shortage, are being greedily
snapped up by the best-gilded. As it is no
longer considered smart to herd in flats and?
paying-guesteries, the newcomers are anxious
to get in early. An oil king is said to have
acquired the Argus Mackinnons’ roomy
place on Toorak hill, which wears a shorn
air nowadays, with red brick villas replacing
its green park lands. The Admiral Bridges
widow, who, with her unattached daughter
Olive, has been tripping in Australia, has
just unloaded her Toorak home, which has
yawned emptily for nearly three years. As
the Bridges son and elder daughters have all
married and settled on the other side of
the line, the family hadn’t much use for it.
A word from Adelaide.: —
Intercollegiate tennis took the usual array of proud
parents and excited flappers to the Oval courts on
u„„..iuay, and blue and white ribbons fluttered
wildly when the final stroke deft St. Peter's with a
rubber win. Their captain was J. L. Bony thou, a
grandson of S’Langdon and a son of Lavington, the
pre-war mayor. Incidentally, Prince Alfred College
has in hand about half the £ 18,000-odd it wants
for the war memorial to its fallen sons, and a concert
at the Grosvenor the other evening added a useful
cheque tc this amount.
Mrs. A. K. 'Goode and Mrs. M. E. Mayfield called
recently on Attorney-General Barwell to tell him that
they want a woman J.P. on the Bench with the
S.M. in the Children’s Court and in the Police Court
for cases in which children are concerned; also a
female probation officer and visiting women justices
at the Adelaide Gaol. From the Minister's reply
it looks as though they’ll get the lot. Meanwhile
Mrs. Goode and Professor Coleman Phillipson are
hard at it. He rashly told the legal Commission
that “women should be kept out of politics. They have
not the same intellectual or logical grasp that men
have, and never will have it, and were never intended
to have it.’’ Mrs. Goode’s reply was that man's
opinion of woman ean be traced to the conditions
of his own home circle. As to the mentality.of jthc
average man, “You’ve only to sit in a tram,” says
Mrs. Goode, “to know what he’s like!”
Lady Bridges and Miss Judge put in part of
Wednesday at the Free Kindergartens. There have
been several meals at Government House during the
week—with Railway Commissioner Webb and his
wife, Canon and Mrs. Bicket-steth, Sir Arthur and
Lady Stanley,- the Roy Burstons and the newly-
returned Max Andersons among the guests.
A cable from Ada Crossley to Mrs. W. A. Magarey
tells that Clara Serena was “unanimously acclaimed
by the .London Press.” Before her marriage Mrs.
Magarey was Miss Guili Hack, once an Elder Scholar
herself and on. the teaching staff of the Consev-
vatorium for some years. She has always been
enthusiastic about Serena’s future, and had a good
deal to do with her early training.
Our branch of the Roads Association has elected
Norman Taylor as its president for the year. The
annual report welcomed a Government intention to
spend about £300,000 on putting down over 70
miles of bituminous concrete in the neighborhood
of Adelaide; this is the result of a report of expert
Fleming, after visiting Europe and America, that
it is the most economical form of construction.
Outside the metropolitan district, the biggest thing,
in sight Is the making of a section of “the Prince's-
highway” by fixing up the sandbanks and clay of
the Coorong into a track usable by motors at any
season. Incidentally, Victoria wants a “Federal-
highway” by way of Serviceton. Thus there are
likely to be at last two real Melbourne-to-Adelaide
roads. Hitherto there has never been one that
a motorist could be sure of finding.
The tennis boom has increased the number ef
courts at the Oval. For the current competitions
3jl are in use, and play begins at 9 a.m.; yet, even
so, it is going to take the committee all its time
to pack 1200 matches into eight days—especially if
olayers are as wickedly unpunctual as they were for
the inter-State matches. On the opening day, Miss
Le Mcssurier won her match from Victoria’s cham-
pion, Miss Boyd, and Miss Weston did likewise by
Miss Rendall. In the evening Mostyn Evans
and Maelaren and his cricket team (the English
captain still limping badly) were the guests of the
Bridges at Government House.

MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
The Dublin promoters who arranged the
Siki-McTigue affair put up a purse of £2OOO, of
which £l5OO was to be the winner’s share. They
must have felt ill when the Republicans ordered
them to call the fight off, as a token of national
sorrow at the shooting of rapparees taken with arms
in their hands, and the Free State Government, to
assert its authority, .commanded them to go ahead.
As it happened, a “vast, prpwd” ignored; the rebel
ultimatum and took- the risk of being blown up
by De Valera’s men or plugged by the Free Staters
guarding the ring. An exploding land mine shook
the building before the proceedings commenced, and
a copy of the Republican embargo, written in Erse,
was handed to the shivering African as he sat in his
corner—with exquisite, humor he was told that it.
was a letter from a female admirer wishing him
luck. Otherwise perfect harmony reigned. The
thing went 20 polite rounds, and McTigue, who is
hnly a middleweight and not much class, was adjudged
the winner on points. Back in Paris with a whole
skin Siki declares he was robbed, but perhaps the
unsophisticated savage believed in his heart that the
gentlemen with the bayonets were there to see .that
he didn’t knock the Irish lad out. And boxed ac-
cordingly.
“The Deacon”: A humorless Dublin priest
is recorded to have objected in advance to the
McTigue-Siki joke. Judging by the enthusiastic roll-
up of Sydney padres to scraps at the Stadium, the
rev. killjoy’s protest will find few echoes here. In
all probability the late Les Darcy would never have
ducked through the ropes but for the interest taken
in his fistic abilities by Father .Toe Coady, then
Stationed at Maitland, and a skilful boxer himself.
When Darcy fought his first fight Father Coady was
i jn his comer sympathising, advising and bucking him
fip generally. He it was, also, who scarified Darcy’s
frities at the dead boy’s graveside.

Firpo, the 14-stone Spanish-Aanerican who
kayoed Jim Tracey at Buenos Ayres, has beaten
Bill Brennan So’ badly that the loser had to be
carried to the hospital And Bresnnan has gone 12
rounds with Jack Dempsey. A Firpo-Dempsey
match, for the usual fabulous purse, is now talked, of.
Brother Jonathan got a bad shock when a despised
Filipino whipped his boss flvwePrlrt, Johnnie Buff,
but if an Argentinan knocks Dempsey, Jonathan
will do something desperate. Declare war, perhaps.

Jimmy Semmens, the Melbourne bantam,
paid his "first visit to Sydney last week and made
a pleasing impression on everyone but Bobby Gray.
Semmens Poxes in the Jem Mace Style, and exhibited
a clean straight left and a highly artistic right cross.
He brought the right to bear in the fifth round, and
down went the Glebe youth for seven seconds. Early
in the eighth, GraV was chipped on the chin, and, as
he was falling; Setfimens placed another right- on the
vital spot. It was the finish. Gray boxed briskly
in the early rounds, but the Victorian thought too
quickly for him and hit too hard.
One of the things that help to discredit
boxing is the rotten citizenship displayed by topnotch
pugs. Sid Godfrey, who, like most of our leading
professional boxers, did not go to the war, was sum-
moned for jury service last week. He asked for
exemption on the alleged ground that to sit in
court from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on five days out of
the seven would prejudice nis training. The Judge
very properly turned this plea down, so Godfrey
turned the Court down —just stayed away and paid
the line. As a prosperous pub-keeper and a moneyed
man otherwise, he can afford to adopt this Bolshevik
attitude, but that in no wise justifies it. There are
two ways in which Godfrey could be made to appre-
ciate the error of his ways: (1) by a committal for
contempt of court; (2) by the spectacle of one who
had robbed his (Godfrey’s) till, with full knowledge
of the First Offenders’ Act, being given the full
benefit of that (in some respects) fool-measure.

“Azrim”: It was the day before the New-
market, and my friend, the sporting- vicah, spoke:
“The last four winners were Molly’s Robe, Red
Dome, Blue Cross and Rostrum. There you have
it —the robe for confirmation, a dome, a cross and the
pulpit. Something aggressively ecclesiastical must clean
this up. What about putting two pounds on St. Speed ?”
We did. There has been a dirge-like note in the
anthems ever since.

“R. R. Mac” : A good sport is Carl Foy,
who owns a property called Auteuil, between Aramac
and Barcaldine (C.Q.). To encourage distance races
for grass-fed horses,; Foy last year gave the Aramac
L. V. Jockey Club trophies to the value of £4OO
for two 12-furlong events. The horses were
to be paddocked for eight weeks, and had to be a
fortnight out of paddock before the meeting ; mini-
mum weight, lOst. In the result 60 prads went
to the paddock; 14 started in the Foy Cup, and 13
in the Wallah Bracelet—so called because Foy rode
a nag called Wallah in the A.l.F.’s Egyptian cam-
paign. For this year’s meeting the proprietor of
Auteuil has donated a gold cup valued at £4OO (it
has to be won three times by the one owner, but not
necessarily by the same horse) and £2OO worth of
trophies.

, An extraordinary action was brought
recently in the London King’s Bench Division
by James White, the well-known racing owner,
against Lady Sykes, who owns the Stedmen stud.
White’s trainer, Hartigan. paid 9600 guineas for
Noblesse Oblige (The Tetrarch-Honors) without seeing
that the colt was “down on the hip” as it paraded round
the ling. White asked for his money back on the
grounds (1) that an animal with a dropped hip
is useless for racing, and (2) that an implied war-
ranty went with so costly a colt. Mr. Justice Lush
disallowed. both contentions, pointing out that Ilaps-
burg won. the Eclipse Stakes with a dropped hip,
and that, anyhow, there can be no implied war-
ranty at a yearling sale. If White had a remedy?—
and the Judge did not even hint he had—it was
apparently against Hartigan, who threw away
£ 10,000' of his employer’s money on an animal
that he hadn’t bothered to run his hand over. It
provides a useful lesson in the need for wariness
at auction sales.

In the absence of Beauford, whose pre-
paration has been interrupted by a mishap and who
may not start during the Easter meetings, Furious
was decidedly the best horse racing at Rosehill
(N.S.W.) on Saturday. With small assistance from
her apprentice jockey, who lost a good position
early in the piece and left his run very late, she
cleverly accounted for the flying Salatis and Special-
ity in the w.f.a. Rawson Stakes, running the nine
furlongs in lmin. 53-Jsec. Among the unplaced
division were David. Julia Grey. Heir Apparent and
Soorak. Although the three-year-old has never won
an all-aged race and was meeting the cracks on
unfavorable terms, he was made a 5-to-4 favorite,
Furious being at 5 to 2. He proved a ghastly
disappointment, being one of the first horses beaten.
Specialitv’s performance was much more impressive.
Lengths behind the field at the five-furlong post the
Persian Knight-Arrogant horse galloped the last
half-mile in a most resolute fashion, and must have
a chance in the Sydney Cup with 9st. 61b. —only
51b. more than his
Metropolitan weight.
Julia Grey showed -all
her old pace for a
mile, and Salatis was
always in the picture.
But his conqueror was
maiiifestlv superior.
She has’ been with-
drawn from the Don-
caster, and, with Beau-
ford away, should take
out one. or two of the
W.f.a. faces at Rand-
wick if she isn’t rhn
into the ground, as she
was last Spring, after
her heroic effort against
the Newcastle horse
and Gloaming in the
Chelmsford Stakes.
BILL DAVIS,

Canterbury Parle
(N.S.W.) R. C.
Rivoli’s showing in the 12-furlong Club Handicap
was even more inglorious than. Soorak’s exhibition
ih the Rawson Stakes. Plainly, this year’s three-
vear-olds are not so good as last year’s lot. Baeked
down to 5 to 4 in a field of 16 thd A..T.C. Derby
winner never flattered his supporters at any stage
of the journey. He finished an indifferent fourth.
The useful Grey Arrow (12’s) won well from the fast-
finishing Bitaili and Solar Rays, both unbacked.
Bitalli shaped better than he has done for a long
time. He is an undoubted stayer, and may come to
light in the Cup.
The Queensland mare Syceonelle let her crowd
down badly in the first division of the seven-furlong
Railway Handicap. Backed as if it were all over,
she was always nearer last than first, Naharadan,
who disappointed in the Villiers, winning handily at
10’s from the consistent Oranian and Glenacre. All
three are in the Doncaster. Sir Maitland, second in
the other division to Volpi (10’s), give the
leaders a long start from the three-furlong post and
only failed by half-a-head. And then the aggravat-
ing youth on top weighed in 21b. light, and Golden
Treasure, a good cut of a horse, was placed second
and Larillo third. Runner-up In the last Doncaster
with Bst., Sir Maitland has a distinct chance in the
next with Bst. 91b., especially as he has, in the
meantime, come third to Rostrum and Fleuriste in
the Epsom with Bst. 61b.
Lady Aura (3’s), looking beautiful, won a six-
furlong Three-year-old Handicap in smashing style.
Campbell Wood’s fine Kenilworth colt, Black Scot
(9 to 4), carried 9st. 91b. to victory in the first
division of the Juvenile Stakes; 1 and in the other
division Rahiri (Tressady-Seotch Queen) came from
a long way back to beat Tingle, Glaciarium and
Girton Girl in the last few strides. The winners
will worthily represent N. S. Wales against King
Carnival and The Monk in the two-year-old classics.
ALF BOYD and JACK MURRAY ,
two Melbourne trainers of the short-haired
brotherhood.
Polo' is on a high level in South Oss. A
scratch team —Gordon Law Smith from the city,
Angas ahd two Murrays from the country—which
went to Victoria for the recent tournament, was
handicapped to give from 2 goals upwards to all-
comers, and 12 to a. four which called itself New
South Wales! Yet the S.A. men won right along.
In the final, against Caramut (Vic.), Eric Murray
hi(d his jaw broken ; and the veteran Frank Downer
took his place successfully for the rest of the match.
Downer was playing polo before most of the others
were born.

About half the earth has entered for the
Dayis Cup this year, and Japan seem?, to have the
likeliest chance of meeting America in the challenge
round. Owing to the new zoning system Japan,
Australia, Maoriland, Canada, Hawaii, the Philippines,
and presumably the Argentine and India, will con-
stitute one-half of the draw, whilst the other will
be confined to all the European nations, comprising
Britain, France, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Italy,
Switzerland, Czecho-Slovakia and Roumania, The
winners on each side will meet in the final in the
U.S., thus saving a heap of the expense previously
caused by sending teams hundreds and (in the
Commonwealth’s case) thousands of miles for pre-
liminary heats. But even now Australia is bound
to suffer heavily on account of its geographical
position. Of last year’s squad—Patterson, Anderson
and O’Hara Wood: —only Anderson may be available,
thus' putting tii is country in the position of with-
drawing altoi'ether or sending a party composed of,
say,' Anderson (or Peach), Hawke s. and one of the
Victorian colts, Sehlesinger or Melnnes, on a long
and hopeless, jaunt. On performances only our three
tirst-highters are capable of extending Kumagae,
Shimidzu and Kashio, If Patterson, Anderson and
Wood don’t' go, Japan will have most to fear from
the Frenchmen, Cochet iiud Gobert.

There are some-highly interesting tennis
players in the M.L. team now visiting Sydney. A
strong metropolitan sidet beat them 17 rubbers to 4,
but the tall G. Ollivier took a set from J. O. Ander-
son and, partnered with" Peacock,' made the champion
and Norman Peach go . all they knew. The wiry
D. France and. A. W. Sims went one better, beating
the 1921 Davis Gup reps, in three straight sets. Sims
also defeated Peach (4 —6, 6—4, 7 —5). He is dis-
tinctly a player of class.

Entries for the S.A. tennis tournament
are an Australian (and possibly a world’s) record.
Eastbourne is known to have had over 1000 and
Melbourne got up to 1110, but Adelaide scores 1129.
The singles handicap brought 201, and had to be
divided into three classes ; also 43 men and 4'4 women
had a sporting shot at the State championship.
“Linesman” : L. N. Rainey, the now some-
what ancient Vic. tennis player, electrified the multi-
tude at the M.C.O. meeting by appearing in long
pants of a distinctive French bagginess. He used
to affect knickerbockers —-in fa< t, he was- the last
of that quaint clan. He still sports an ancient
skull-cap, flourishes the old-fashioned, flat-topped
racquet, and has a wristband as a mascot or some-
thing. Incidentally, he is ,a vegetarian, but he
seems to thrive well on the-diet, for he knocks the
bull about for long periods without'showing fatigue,
and is indisputably one of the toughest propositions
in Victorian tennis. Rainey was grounded in the
Melbourne Grammar School, Which has the recoi'd for
producing tennis champions and - Prime Ministers.
Brookes, Wertheim, O’Hara Wood and his more bril-
liant brother, Arthur, who was killed' at the war,
and the promising young Sehlesinger, were all edu-
cated at Grammar.
*" * « *
“Linesman” : Dr. Curtis," who batted bril-
liantly for Ballarat in the country-cricket week, is
one of the old quartz city’s first string of tennis
players. More than 20 years ago he wielded one
of the most skilful racquets in the Commonwealth
and won the N.S.W. singles championship in first-
class style. In 1905 he came to Melbourne from
Adelaide, where he had been studying medicine,
and, without any preliminary practice, fought his
way into the finql of the Australasian singles, in
which he was finished off, after a game struggle, by
llod Heath, then a rising star in the tennis world.
Kulv 30 then, he must now be the age when
most active sports have put the implements of re-
creation away. All the same, he feels so fresh and
youtnful that he expects to play for Ballarat for a
good while yet.

Prahran aud Fitzroy are now certain of
places in the final four that will battle for the
standard in Melbourne pennant cricket. North Mel-
bourne, Hawthorn-East, St. lvilda and Melbourne are
struggling for the other two places. South Melbourne,
well out of the hunt from the beginning of the
season, had a lively afternoon on Saturday at the
expense of Northcote. They whacked up 468 for
five wickets at the rate of over 100 runs an hour,
Park, who had one life, scoring 160, whilst WoodfulKs
blameless bat added another 187. Ironmonger, who
has recently been bowling with little success for St.
Kilda, had* a belated triumph in skittling eight of
Melbourne, including Armstrong, Vaughan .and Hans-
ford, for 65. Carlton, North’s left-hander, who was
foolishly left out of the State XI against N. S. Wales,
was the cause of extreme melancholy among Haw-
thorn-East. He got 6 for 28, and with the help of
Matthews (3 for 31) dismissed the side for 61.
* * * *
Waverley, last year’s premiers in Sydney
grade cricket, moved to the top of the ladder again
by defeating Gordon. The latter, with Macartney
away in Westralia, failed by 47 runs, on the fir.-t
innings. A sparkling second-innings stand by
Eric Bull (138) and W. L. Trenerry (141
n. 0.) enabled Mosman to crush Central Oumberh|nd,
Bull—a splendid hitter when he gets going—mailing
his runs in 75 minutes. The finish will be fought
out by Waverley (30 points), Gordon (28), Mosman
and North Sydney (27 points each).

Adelaide has had a country cricket week,
with all kinds of teams opposing each other yn the
suburban ovals. The main result was the discovery
of one Bowley, from Clare. His average is,, some-
where near 100, and might be almost anything but
for his engaging habit of retiring when lie has made
his usual century, lie is. a useful bowler too, and
was at once included in the State XI for the
match against a very tired lot of Englishmen.
Inexcusably dropped catches helped South Aus. to hit
up 495 in one day. The said Bu>vley. put up a
free though lucky 76 run out, and Hymiil a stylish
3|o. Arthur Kiehardson (who also learned his cricket
at. Clare) had big figures: 104 before lunch, 224
at tea, and 280 altogether. With a succession of free
hats at the other (Old, he'scored close on 2 to their
1 throughout, lie was missed three times, but it
was a great performance, coming on top of his
150 against the same team in November and' 155
against N.S.W. in Sydhey. He has the bad luck
to be the only first-class Australian batsman of the
moment who never gets a chance at the weak S.A.
bowling. Maclaren’s men replied with 372, Caltliorpe
getting 96 and WiJsou<7B; and S.A. • closed their
second essay 'With fotir 'down for 204, the M.C.O.
losing four for 248. Chapman made the draw certain
by smacking up 134 n.o. in 106 minutes, lie is
a’ dashing youngster, and Australia will be glad
to see him return with the next Test team. And he
is recorded to have said that he will be only too
glad to come. t -

Steele, the m.L( " three-quarter and ‘ ,'professional
sprinter, is a modern, instance of that. George
Smith, the great wing three of. the'-original All
Blacks, a professional runner and billiard-player,tvas
another. r Generally.'.'speaking the R.U. care.s little
if a player is a Mpsait at any game: save Rugby foot-
ball. Its reason is,, that., the modern Rugger, game
had its basis in pure amateurism. The capture of
Soccer bV the pros;,'~rrf tire ""’eighties and early
’nineties, with all its attendant abuses, was a grim
warning. So, when the NOfthfern Union started'pro-
fessional football in Banoashire -and i'.Yorkshire, ih
the early ’nineties with an eye on the fat Soccer
gates, the R.U. set its face against paid Rugger. As
“D.” says, the trueis-the man who lives
on the game. In the North of England the first-
class player does so. So: do; some of the top-notchers
in N. S. Wales.
A PEACEFUL FIGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Siki-McTigue fight was conducted in a
bayonet-ringed building. .. .A thousand Free State
soldiers vigilantly patrolled the vicinity to prevent
threatened attempts to blow up the building.”
When pugilists meet, in a general way
They don’t waht the Law on the scene,
But the rule doesn’t hold when the place and the day
Are Ireland and March seventeen.
Round the ring, as denoting authority’s might,
The soldiers in squadrons were set
To make it a cert, that the hope of the white
And the pride of the black for the laurel should
fight
Without any hindrance or let.
Say, doesn’t it fancy intrigue,
The notion of Order in league
With majestical Law
That an Irishman’s paw
( Unhindered should crash on an African’s jaw
When Siki encountered McTigue?
At Rushcutters Bay are sensations to spare
j That few would be willing to miss,
But the thrill and the rapture procurable there
Are surely insipid to this.
Whoever a seat for the combat could seize
t As he took it must surely have felt
(He’d a chance of being heavenward blown on the
breeze
Ere Erin was, through with the Senegalese
Or the nig. had outpointed the CeR.
Oh, Sambo was wily and tricky,
And game as a pebble was Micky,
While with bayonets fixed
Stood a regiment betwixt
The peril without and the boxer that mixed
His punches and counters with Siki.
The mob its quietus in bulk might have copped
And the Stadium sailed skyward in joints
Ere either contestant sufficient had Stopped
To make him a loser on points.
But soldiers encompassed the building about —
Inspiring more awe than police—
That Afric might land oh Hibernia’s snout
6r get itself punched on the kidneys without
Disturbing his Majesty’s peace. y >
No sport-spoiling rebel
As much as a bomb at a tram ;
Pugs belted away
On St. Patrick his day
And Dublin was orderly, cheerful and gay
When Shamus was walloping Ham.

Glad Days
through
Sunny Ways
Away, out in the sunshine, Australia
calls you.
What days of gladness the owner of a
B.S.A. Motor Cycle enjoys.
For the young man who rides solo, or the
family man who rides with the comfort-
able, roomy sidecar combination, the
B.S.A. is the ideal mount.
Ideal in economy, long service and abso-
lute dependability.
Every B.S.A. model is individually tested
and is now fitted with B.S.A. three-speed
countershaft gear. Extra strength to
each vital point is obtained by drop-
forgings of specially selected Sheffield
steel.
Every refinement that a Motor Cycle
should have is found in the B.S.A.

Do You Use a B.S.A. Gun ?
“I think that women should be kept out of
politics. They have not the same intellectual
logical grasp men have, never will have it,
and were never intended to have it. Those
who have intellect have not much charm,
and those who have charm have not much
intellect.” — Professor Coleman Phillipson, of
Adelaide Uni., giving evidence before a Royal
Commission.
George Wise, with the political hobbles
off, cut a better figure at the A.N.A. Confer-
ence at Sale (Vic.) than he has done at thojse
annual corroborees for years. His speeches
were foi'ceful and logical, and he was
fresh and energetic instead of tired and half-
interested. A new generation of delegates
voted solidly for retaining him on the board
of directors, and he got a high place on the
poll among the elected.
“Faafua”: Under the mandatory laws
governing Samoa, not only is there no death
penalty, but corporal punishment is not
sanctioned in the penal code. A native was'
recently convicted of outraging a white
woman, but the most the Judge could do
was to deplore the state of the law and pass
a life sentence. This is the first case of its
kind in Samoa under M.L. rule; and awak-
ening to the facts has made the white popu-
lation feel very uncomfortable.
Czechoslovakia, in which Bohemia is the
principal partner, floated some loans for re-
pair purposes after the war, and when the
first one fell due the other day it was paid
off out of revenue. Now the little republic
(it is only five-eighths the size of Victoria,
though it runs four universities) lias sent
agents to the United States to arrange about
liquidating debts there. And we used to
think a Bohemian was a long-haired party'
who banged a piano in a studio and paid no
man.
“Yarrum” : We’ve heard of a lot of cham-
pion mean men, but here’s an entry for the
champion generous one. William Scott, of
Mulloon, in the Braidwood (N.S.W.) dis-
trict, had one of the best orchards in the
State —peaches, pears, apples, plums, quinces
and cherries galore, with melons of all sorts
littering the landscape for miles. As soon
as the.fruit ripened, or a little before, Scott
advertised each year in the Goulburn Herald,
“Fruit ripe at'Mulloon. Bring your carts
and help yourselves.” I’ve seen as many
as 20 carts roll up in a day.
“Wilfrido” : I know' of at least two “stum-
pies” in M.L. who take part in tennis tour-
naments, and one who is a 10-8 man at golf.
The golfer plays most frequently with his
artificial leg off, and it is a great sight to
see him balance himself as he takes his drive.
On the subject of the overcoming of war
disabilities, I sat in the train with Clutha
Mackenzie, the blind ex-M.P., and watched
him rattling off letters on his portable
machine. He showed me one of them in
which the typing was so good that ever since
I have been ashamed of my own.
“F.A.”: “Speculum” (B. 22/2/’23) is
right about the Maori’s thoroughness as a
fort-builder. On the hills overlooking Ander-
son’s Bay, Dunedin, there still remains evi-
dence of it in the form of a crude battle-
ment of earthworks, semi-circular in shape.
The parapets have been lowered by the spade
of Time, but the approaches remain for-
midable. Huge holes are dotted here and
there on the braes, not easily discernible be-
cause the openings are small. Convivial
Macs, late-homing from club or pub, find
them awkward obstacles still.
“Tally-Ho” : J. Compton Penny, just fare-
welled by the Speck’s civil service, has been
in the pay of the island taxpayers for 52
years. Modest and unassuming, his retire-
ment from the position of Chief Forest
Officer—his latter-day billet —leaves Con-
servator Irby’s department the poorer. A
significant epilogue to his half-century odd
of service was a Cabinet pronouncement to
the effect that financial stringency made it
impossible for the State to grant him the
customary six months’ leave of absence on
full pay.
“King Ivurrajong” : On the estate of Pon
Look Pty., Ltd., in the sleepy Ovens Valley,
near Myrtleford (Vic.), there are 105 acres
of hops, the biggest garden devoted to this
vegetable south of the line. The yield this
year, in spite of drought conditions, will be
about 80 tons. Three new kilns have lately
been erected, and furnace-heated air is
sucked into the drying-rooms by huge fans.
The hops are spread out for about 16 hours
on the drying floors in a temperature of
105 deg. to 130 deg. There are now approxi-
mately 500 people in these buildings and in
camps along the river engaged in picking
the hops. Henry Jones, the uncrowned king
of jamdom, is the man behind the enterprise.
“Topee’s” philosophic victualler :
I showed “V.C.’s” par-. (B. 15/2/’23) re souveniring
in Melbourne restaurants to an old ex-mining friend
who now runs an eating-house near the water-
front. His comment was: “If he ran a joint like
mine, with a second-hand shop next door, he’d have
to consider the leakage at the kitchen end, too.
Saturday’s pay-day and the staff’s mostly broke by
Friday. About 10 . o’clock the chef feels like he
could stop one, and slips out with a carving-knife.
When he’s back his off-sider ducks with the fork.
The sight of him wiping his mouth sends the kitchen-
man out with a spoon or two —lucky if it ain’t
the meatchopper. That’s bad enough, but the other
week the gang went out together and passed a
new copper stockpot over the counter and mucked
up the early dinner. No, I didn’t fire them; they’ll
chuck it soon enough on their own.”
“Hay-street”: Some of the Perth Nation-
alists are uneasy about E. A. Mann, their
new M.H.R. He was never regarded as a
Gnash until he called at the Federation
office a month or so before the election and
paid his 2s. 6d., and he is known to have
got Labor’s No. 2 vote. Mann attributes
his victory to popular sympathy over his
dismissal from the nosition of Gov. Analyst
after the Perth Civil service strike, in which
he was prominent. In point of fact, there
was very little sympathy for him outside the
Civil service. Mann got the solid support
of the rank and file of both services, Com-
monwealth and State. These, with their
womenfolk, were responsible for his first
count of a trifle over 3000 votes in a total
of 33,577 electors. Small as this poll was it
gave him a lead over the other Nationalist
candidates, which lead he never lost. His
win is really an argument for separate repre-
sentation of Government servants.

WRITE FOR THE PRESS
THERE IS PROFIT AND PLEASURE IN JOURNALISM
Compose smart paragraphs, verse and stories from a cosy corner in your own home, or
undertake the duties of a city news-reporter. In either case you will have gained the entree to
a .world of strange and intriguing happenings known only to the privileged few, and entered
a profession that is to-day more profitable than at any time in its history.
After one of the shortest preliminary trainings on record, the writer of this (now on the
staff of Australia’s foremost daily paper) mastered the knack of turning out every kind of press
work, from a few lines on the weather, a fatal street accident, or a big criminal trial, to a
short story, a special descriptive article, and even first-hand reports from a foreign battle-
front. His rapid success was due to his working on an extremely simple commonsense system
of WORD AND IDEA BUILDING; and he can how show to you how, step by step, each of the
journalistic duties mentioned above may be mastered by any person of average intelligence who

“If Winter Comes,” at Sydney Royal, is
assured of a successful run on the strength
of one of the finest works of fiction published
in England for many a year. Pretty well
everyone knows the plot, and has revelled in
the widely-differing character studies that
A. S. M. Hutchinson presents with such re-
markable skiff in the lights and shades. But
the piay, like most plays of this sort, is a
rather scrappy and inadequate attempt to
convey the printed page before the foot-
lights. One misses some of the characters
that helped to make the book by elucidating
Mark Babre’s outlook on the world, which
is, after ail, the«secret of the novelist’s strik-
ing success. Failing those characters, like
the garrulous lawyer whose impressions of
his old schoolfellow are set forth at length,
and the Rev. Boom Bagshaw, a remarkably
revealing type of cleric, an audience that
hadn't read "If Winter Comes” would be
handicapped in getting a just appreciation of
Sabre. Other characters that are entirely
in the background in the original—notably
.Major Millet —loom large in the play, possibly
because it was thought necessary to provide
Mabel Sabre with her ideal husband as early
as Mark was fitted with his affinity. Of
course, in addition, a good deal of liberty has
been taken with the text, and the play opens
with Babre having been accepted .for the
army, on the Derby scheme, which doesn’t
take place till the book is well on its way.,
* * * *
There are some strong scenes withal, and
some powerful acting—after the characters
have been introduced and set in position,
which takes some time. The best act is the
last: there Lady Tybar tells Fortune and
Twyning some home-truths which are not in
the original text. The coroner’s-court scene
in the third act is quite the least convincing,
and goes closest to cheap melodrama. It is
weak in the book, too; judicial inquiries are
not conducted in that hysterical style—not
in England, anyhow. On the stage it is
still more of a travesty, with the clowning
of the chemist and Low Jinks to make it
merely a little more incongruous as a pre-
sentation of life. Yet the scene will probably
be a favorite. If a solicitor looks the part
—ns Reginald Wykeham unquestionably does
—few will care if he doesn’t speak it. But a,
little legal advice might have helped the
author of “If Winter Comes,” both in the
book and in the play. Garry Marsh as Mark
Sabre is excellent. He is a fine actor who
has absorbed the spirit of the part, and the
rare humanness that distinguishes it. Jane
Savile gives a clever rendering of the wife
utterly unable to understand any viewpoint
but that of a dean’s daughter, or to have any.
interests but her own ultra-conventional
ones. Muriel Martin-Harvey, as Effie Bright,
is a flitting sunbeam and woe incarnate with
almost equal facility. Ailsa Grahame, gs
Lady Tybar, rises high in the concluding-
scene. George Blunt and Leslie Victor, as,,
the Rev. Sebastian Fortune and Mr. Twy/
ning, are fine studies in pompous, unctuous
humbug and furtive hypocrisy. The latter’s
mixture of slyness and cringing is admirable;
and his reverend senior partner might almost
be a Dickens creation. Sidney Stirling is
the kind of Major Millet whom a lady like
Mabel would be attracted towards, and quite
the cavalier whom Sabre sums up so aptly.
Georgia Harvey and Lorna Helms make
pleasant Jinkses. The play is well staged
and the scenery easily fills the not extensive
requirements.

“Dear Brutus,” which Gregan McMahon
has produced for the Sydney Repertory
Society at the Conservatorium Hall, was
one of J. M. Barrie’s attempts to enliven a
nation engaged in war. It made its first
appearance at Wyndham’s Theatre, London,
in 1917, and had a successful revival last year.
But it isn’t Barrie at his best. Described as
“a,fantastic comedy” it is fantastic to the
extent that a 20th-century Robin Goodfellow
causes a 'company of very ordinary people
of the upper-middle class to spend a mid-
summer night in an enchanted wood. But
that, the most elaborate act, isn’t handled
with the delicate art that Barrie has exhi-
bited in other plays. It is made rather try-
ing by a too-long-drawn-out dialogue be-
tween a bibulous painter and his dream-
child. However, there are moments when
the thing is charming, and the Repertory
people did it capitally. Honors were divided
among the women by Mrs. Reg Suttor, as
the painter’s wife, and Gene Magnus, his
daughter. Coralie McKellar was also excel-
lent at times as an arch philanderer.. Some
enjoyable fooling was supplied by S. R.
Irving as a heavy butler and Albert Collins
as au elderly gent, who goes quite mad in
the enchanted wood, and the professional
touch was capably provided by George Bry-
ant and McMahon. The others were all
tolerable.
“The Bush Outlaw,” at Sydney Opera
House, is a play of scant merit, crude melo-
drama leavened with a trifle of low comedy.
The players are scheduled as Australian,
and one is invited to accept the setting as
also Australian on the strength of gum-trees
and a rickety swag. If these were eliminated,
the moving tale unfolded by six players in
four acts might just as well be located in
any other part of the world —North America
has the strongest claim, for the “old farmer”
of the cast is alternatively described as a
“ranchman,” the villain is a mining magnate
who once lets slip a reference to "State’s
prison,” and the curtain falls tyith the hero-
ine in the arms of a gentlehpm who has
arrived within measurable distance of be-
coming “the Cattle King of the Middle
West.” It is a hotchpotch that might set
Oscar Asche and his co-prospectors for
Australian dramatists knitting their brows.
But the players may at least be credited with
doing their best in the circumstances. Cappy
Caspers, who is the “Bush Outlaw”;iand an
escaped convict (sentenced, of course, un-
justly), is wrought upon by the villain, who
knows his secret, to claim the heroine, Kath-
leen Butler, as his daughter, iiv furtherance
of said villain’s matrimonial schemes, and
to remove her from her affluent surroundings
to his own squalid shack, the hitherto re-
puted parents, convinced of his Hohd fidcs,
resigning themselves to the inevitable in
sobful attitudes. In the end it turns out
(owing to the fortunate discovery of docu-
ments in the Family Bible) that the lady
really is Cappy’s progeny, and the traditional
unities of "Surrey-side melodrama” are fur-
ther preserved by the rascally mining mag-
nate being gaoled and everyone else rehabili-
tated and made happy. Fred Macdonald plays
Cappy with spirit and all the convincingness
possible; Vera St. John is sweetly filial in
two different settings; Ethel Raye, as Trixie
Snow’s, the maid, is the only character who
gets the chance to act naturally; John Gal-
way is a passable villain,/Oliver Barclay a
fair-to-middling lover, and/the old Butler
couple, are quite creditably represented by
S. A. Fitzgerald and Cora" Warner.

Sydney Globe has dropped “Manslaugh-
ter,” which is now at the Empress, in favor
of Theodore Roberts in “The Old Home-
stead,” the thrilling climax to which is the
wreck of a whole village by a cyclone. The
Lyceum presents a treble bill—-“ Come On
Over,” a frolicsome helping of un-American-
ised Irish humor; Teddie Gerrard in a
Yosemite Valley advt., “The Cave Girl”;
and Rev. Frank Gorman, “the singing par-
son.” The Lyric also shows “Come On

Strand and Haymarket, with an only-fair
comedy, “Her Sturdy Oak.” Hoyt’s has
“Ouida’s” “Under Two Flags,” featuring Pris-
cilla Dean; “Broad DayLght,” a story of
some crooks who. intending to marry a girl

ford st.li enriches the Crystal Palace with
“Tess of the Storm Country,” and the Majes-

ALL READY FOR HIS NEW PART.
“If it is necessary to appoint a High Commissioner
at Washington it is probable the Government will
have to take prompt action."—Mr. Bruce.
At Sydney Hippodrome Wirths’ Circus is
still giving patrons generous entertainment
in heaped-high measure, Equestrian, acro-
batic, aerial and aquatic champions are all
on the bill, and Samuel Pepys would un-
doubtedly have chronicled their output, had
lie lived to see it, as "a brave shbw which
did please me mightily.”
“Enter Madame,” the second Gertrude
Elliott production at Adelaide Royal, is
light, frothy, amusing, and utterly American.
Gerald is tired of his wife, Madame Risa
Della Robbia, a great singer who, when she
see's him at all, trails him about the world
as one of her suite. He has been cynically
called “president of the Only-Her-Husband
Club,” and is sick of it. So lie has arranged
marriage with a widow prior to getting a
facile American divorce. And then enter
Madame to discuss settlements. She is a
human whirlwind, “temperamental” to the
last degree. She brings doctor, cook, seere-
tarv and maid, Italianises Gerald’s flat, and
turns him out of it. Later, with the divorce
already granted, she gives a supper to her
successful rival, claiming that “we have so
much in common.”. The husband stays on;
and in the half-light Lisa becomes human
and domestic. He could, she says,
have made what he would of h,er
life; she has given up the stage, any-
how. And —well, he does not go away.
But in the last act, with the widow’s
departure cattishly to sue for damages, Lisa
is renewing all her stage engagements, and
the' whole suite, with Gerald swept into it,
is off whirlwind-fashion to South America.
“Here,” he cries helplessly; “I’m doing all
the things I swore I’d never do again.” Just
one he will not do—“carry the dam’ dog” ;
but at curtain-fall he is 1 doing precisely that.
It is all a cynical trifle; the kind of fare
which New York likes to take ip between a
late dinner and a hot supper. But alone it
will hardly do here. Both of the season’s
plays take barely two hours in the acting.
For the 8 o’clock start, a curtain-
raiser seems demanded. Australia is under-
stood to be full of such things waiting their
chance. it is.
Gertrude Elliott has every mood at com-
mand. It is easy to see why “Eyes of
Youth” has been a favorite play of hers,
and she is free from the mannerisms winch
are growing on Emelie Polini. Cronin-
Wilson’s huskiness, already alluded to,, proves
to be the outcome of a bad gassing in the
war. He is a humorist, with an easy man-
ner—somewhere between Frank Harvey and
Graham B rowne> Lilias Waldegrave again
cleverly serves as foil for the real heroine,
and the support is good. Maggie Moore
had a great reception, and the star insisted on
her sharing the final curtain-call.
* * * *
Nellie Bramley, “Bought and Paid For,”
*at Melbourne Playhouse, is probably begin-
ning to appreciate the difficulty of trying to
illuminate a dozen different moods with two
tones of voice. The clamorous protest of
insulted modesty and the meek heroine-in-a-
garret note of resignation are right enough
for Fuller bellow T drama, but the actress
wants to show greater vocal resources for a
lady of the character of Virginia Blayne. In
every scene Miss Bramley is either middling
or muddling, cheerfully lowering the effect
of Virginia’s best passages through want of
study or concentration. The second act
provides the highest curve in Guy Hastings’s
dramatic chart to date. As a champagne-
soaked millionaire he is quite as real as
Charles Milward was when he smashed in
the door of Muriel Starr ; but as a sober and
contrite husband he slumps into the butter-
milk manner. The result is a contrast be-
tween the Dirty Night and the Morning
After which is almost farcical in its empna-
sis. Ethel Bashford doesn’t produce the
elixir of life for the part of Fanny Blayne,
whom one remembers as a robust and jolly
sort in a previous impersonation. Also
George Hewlett’s turbulent crudity is con-
spicuous enough to be depressing in the i'Ole
of Jimmy Gilley. Hewlett apparently knows
no moderation. His idea of light and glad-
some speech would pass for a yell of censure
at a public meeting.
The Sistine Soloists are tossing off familiar
operatic tunes in a demonstrative farewell
at Melbourne Town Hall. Probably the
best of the group is Rasponi, the slender
baritone who duets most effectively with
Paganelli, a lyric tenor with a pianissimo
that can be made to hover miraculously on
the. brink of silence. Their artistic render-
ing of a notable and vivacious dialogue in
song had every hand in motion op Saturday
night. Facchini, a luscious pfeddler of oper-
atic remnants like “Yesti la giubba” and "E
Lucevan le Stelle,” has mastered the art of
enlarging , a sob until his whole body seems
bloated with grief. A few gusts of his
Clown’s, tragic lament frbm “Pagliacei’
would reduce a pony bookmaker to a cas-
cade of tears. There are two other tenori,
tffie large and affable Pasinati and the abbre-
viated Sqrti—the latter does very well in
t.fe" “Carizone di Foleo” from Mascagni s
“Isabeau” —and a couple of serviceable
Basses. Ccjnstantini and Belli. Though her
and there: one observes some roughness in.a
voice that has possiblv become ravelled in
continuous chorus work, generally Speaking
the comminy is good, and each member gives
his best with enormous enthusiasm. In fact,
the furious hand-shaking and salutations! be-
tween the songsters and their conductor
and accompanist, Casolari, are reminiscent
of one of; those “Back-to-Bluegum” celebra-
tions which are now so fashionable.
“The O’Brien Girl” is still at Melbourne
Princess’s; and the leading man is still in
need of ginger to arrive at a passable sem-
blance of a hero who is likely to get a firm
footing in Mamie Watson’s heart.
Every evening the whisky bottle at Mel-
bourne King’s is brought clown to drought
level by the efforts of Ambrose Applejohn to
stiffen his spirit for his “Adventure.”
“Chu Chin Chow” beat a sudden retreat
from Melbourne Majesty’s last Tuesday, pnd
the empty stage is now waiting for “A
Southern: Maid,” which moves up from the
Royal to'make room for Gertrude Elliott in
“Woman ito Woman.” Asche’s compimy
moves on: to Perth.
Bert Maddison, the English burlesque
comedian; is receiving a shout of welcome
from Melbourne Tivoli supporters, who find
a special.; bouquet in his particular form of
humor. There is also a kindly feeling‘ for
the French “novelty duo,” Geaiks and Geaiks,
who are: catalogued as “Famous” by ‘the
management, and probably feel that way at
the end of their turn. The. Two Vaga-
bonds, Oswald Remand, the pigeon expert,
and the quartette of cullud singers are fail-
ing to produce a gasp of astonishment.
One needs a quick hand and a load of
ammunition to lead a charmed life in “The
Law of the Great Nor’-West” at Melbourne
Majestic this week. There are, however, some
quiet moments in “Come On Over,” an art-
less : Irish romance, which, despite a feu'
boresome passages, wheedles one, into a for-
giving frame of mind. The multitude can
take its choice between “Pink Gods” find
“Her'Sturdy Oak” at Hoyt’s. _ Neither ot
them is striking, but Bebe Daniels is a per-
sonable heroine in the former, and the latter
may serve as a guide-book or a warning to
the soft-headed section of the about-to-be-
married. Placid people in need of excite-
ment are advised to sample the Britannia*
feature, “The Man from Beyond,” the thrills
whereof include Houdini’s breathless rescue
of the lierione from the Niagara Falls.
In Adelaide the Serenaders hare had their
100th night (nearly all of perfect weather)
in the open. Dampier dominates the clever
crowd at the Dandies. Fillipini is singing
beautifully at the Majestic, and Fred Bluett
is just coming in. In pictures, Mary Minter,
at Wondergraph, shows the danger of allow-
ing a Little Girl to get a chance at her big
sister’s admirers ; and Teddy Gerard, at tne
York, does a cave-w r oman act in which steal-
ing food seems to be the most daring pan-
The Pav. continues the heavy sentiment (to
big business) of “The Old Nest” t and Larri
Semon, at West’s, agreeably varies the melo-
drama of the old “Shaughraun.” There i*
also a marked tendency to/drop vaneo
turns into picture programmes.

“R;C.B.”: Julius Knight, just back in
Australia, well remembers liis first night in
“Claudian,” at the Sydney Royal. In the
great earthquake scene, when Knight had
to emerge unscathed, groaning "1 cannot
die f” with the stage all round knee-deep in
dead, a block and tackle used in the tableau
fell from the flies and gave the hero a clout
on the ear. It was a disgusting anti-climax
to a tragic scene, and the stagehands re-
sponsible for the accident hid inside some of
the sham masonry to avoid reprisals. Nor
does Julius forget a Queensland tour when
the lighting arrangements in some of the
villages visited were so primitive that he
had great difficulty in providing himself
with the illumination he deserved. In one
hamlet the gas wasn’t strong enough for his
favorite “spot,” so lie hired a local youth to
concentrate the beams of an acetylene bike-
lamp on his classic countenance. One night
the lamp went out, and the proprietor of
the local rag, who was well aware of the
arrangement, caustically announced: “We
were elevated by a mixed programme at the
Mechanics’ last night: ‘Monsieur Beaueaire’
and ‘The Light that Failed.’ ”
“The Mug” : 1 also regret the non-success
of Bennison (B. 15/3/'23), but it is idle
for “Nella” to blame "Johnny, Get Your
Gun.” In point of fact, the man did bet-
ter business with “Johnny” than with incom-
parably better plays. He failed from the
box-office standpoint because he wasn’t sup-
plied with a leading lady of his own theatri-
cal stature. Coyne crashed for the same
reason. Asche has also suffered, as
"Winkle” (B. 8/3/’2B) pointed out. In
other days J.C.W. never imported a male
star without seeing that lie had sup-
port of equal planetary effulgence. Under
more economical management a practice has
grown up of giving leading-women roles to
smirking ingenues, whose enunciation is im-
perfect, and languid fashion-plates, selected
for their decorative effect in walking-on parts
and for their exquisite manner of saying
"Mnmmah, it is reahll.v taime to go to the
Duchess’s tea-partay.” Bennison’s bitter ex-
perience shows that it won’t do.
“Santander” : I thought that Marc Antony
was a blonde, but this time Oscar Asche
makes him ddxk-haifed and gives him a pair
of mid-Victorian sideboards. But evidently
Asche can’t make up his mind about
Antony’s coloring, for on a former tour Marc
Oscar’s thatch was the tint of a ripe
tomato.
“G.A.C.”: Let it be said of little Reg
Long, of the stock company now at Bris-
bane Royal, that he is game. It was at a
matinee performance of “The Boomerang,”
and Long yvas playing the part which Donald
Bowles did with Hale Hamilton and Myrtle
Tannehill. The first act takes place in a
doctor’s surgery, and while Long was being
settled on the operating-table three fingers
were crushed in the extension thereof, the
nails being yanked off. I wasn’t aware there
was anything wrong until 1 saw blood drip-
ping from the boy’s hand, and the girl beside
me fainted. But Long kept going gamely
until they got him off the stage. Then he
fainted. A doctor forbade him to go on
again, but he went through his part at night
with his hand in a sling. Light comedy with
a crushed hand —fancy it!
“Archbell”: Five or six years ago Tom
Moore, who dances in “A Southern Maid,”
piloted a motor-lorry about Melbourne. I
toiled for the same firm, and sometimes, when
the head serang was away, Tom would give
us afi impromptu show in the works office —
a grand-ofiPra number or two, with a step-
dance to finish. I often told the songan-
dance youth that there was something better
in store for him than coaxing a tin-lizzie
about the subbubs. There was. He has
engaged himself to Gladys Moncrieff.
“Private Boxer”: I agree with “Cyrano”
(B. 1/3/’23) that if we got the best of con-
temporary drama in Australasia “50 per cent,
of the .audience wouldn’t know how to take
it.” Also, what of the press critics? Is
there one writer on the daily newspapers
who is capable of appraising and giving a
verdict in good Engl.sh when a really good
play is staged? I doubt it. No critic is
required for such stuff as revue, musical
comedy and the eternal pitchers, and as we
have had very little else of late years, where
is the cultured commentator to come from?
Certainly the slush that passes for theatri-
cal criticism in this part of the world nowa-
days is enough to make a well-wisher of the
stage weep tears of blood.
“Norbell” : How history and Harry Lauder
repeat themselves! Or is it that both are
lacking in a sense of humor? When he was
here four years ago, Lauder featured a song
of his own making, which ran:—
Where the soft wind blows and the gum-tree grows,
As far as the eye can see;
Where the magpie chaffs and the kookaburra laughs—
Australia is the land for me.
When he arrived the other day he lined up
bis “choir” along the rails of the Sonoma to
sing it again, and the Sun assured us that
"these are the words of Sir Harry Lauder’s
latest sbng, which he composed on the voyage
to Australia.” I suppose the canny showman
has a song for each country he invades.
Perhaps one goes :
Where the home-brew flows under Volstead’s nose,
It’s a braw breght spoilt tae see;
If ye want tae wet veer throttle, there's a drappie
in the bottle —
Three stars and green stripes for me!
“Blackfliars” : When will the music
scribes be able to decide what kind of voice
the eldest. Castles girl has got? Melbourne
Herald has raised the question again b.v
making a half-hearted declaration that, after
all, she is only a mezzo-soprano. Well, if
Amy’s a mezzo, Caruso must Lave been a
baritone. 1 could have sworn during my first
half-hour’s hearing of Enrico, singing as
Don Jose in a Covent Garden "Carmen,”
that the man was a baritone, So inured had
I become to the silverv Danis and Kirbys
that the Australian flapper imagines to be
the only kind of tenor. If the Castles voice
is not the real dramatic soprano, then this
country never produced one. There is pro-
bably no other in the world that so closely
resembles Destinil’s, and that lady draws as
big money as Melba just for being dramatic
and rare.
“Loud”: The Incorporated Stage Society
has caused a real howl by producing at the
London Shaftesbury Ford’s old piny, "’Tis
Pity She’s a —-er —Tart.” The last word is
a euphemism for an old, Saxon term which
did not worry the Elizabethans any more than
its Latin equivalent; but it is now so un-
fashionable that, when it occurs in a , "lan-
guage” case, the prosecuting constable mostly
writes it on a bit of paper and hands it up
to the Bench, from a coy unwillingness to
pronounce it. So the general public is
asked heatedly why the I.S.S. should be
“SALLY," AT SYDNEY MAJESTY’S.
Blair Farquar (Georoe Baker) tells Sally
(Josie Melville) to “look for the silver
lining."
allowed to give it prominence in the news-
papers. And this although the old play is
not as bad as many of the recent dug-up
things; in fact, perhaps no worse in its gen-
eral idea than “The Second Mrs. Tanqueray.”
“S.T„”: T. P. O’Counor, as English film-
censor, has been defending the cuts made by
his department in a new screen version of
“Oliver Twist.” They include (1) the bat-
tering to death of Nancy with a bludgeon;
(2) the unintentional but effectual hanging
of Sikes; and (3) the semi-humorous scene
in which Fagin gives Oliver professional in-
struction in the art of picking pockets. This
last episode, as now allowed, says O’Connor, is
“shown but not elaborated.” He sums up
that “no other course would be in accord
with the principles and precedents we have
laid down during our existence.” Apropos,
the Commonwealth film censorship has
imposed its interdict on “Oliver.” But it
licensed the screening of the abominable
“Sheik’s Wife.”
“Norbell”: The moving-pitcher showman
is becoming too good to be true. The other
day his Sydney organisation wrote to the
Methodist Conference, protesting, in a
shocked whisper, against “the publication by
The Two Vagabonds, at Melbourne Tivoli.
the press of the ‘sordid details’ in tlie Mel-
bourne iffilrder case” on the ground that thej;
“jeopardised the morals of young people.”
Meanwhile, as a guarantee of good faith,
this advt. was appearing in the newspapers:
The Selznick Super extended season attraction
that every man, woman, youth and flapper has been
waiting for !
A reckless, Fighting Flapper held Captive in
the Mountain Retreat of a Reckless “Beast 1”
Special Matinfie at 2.30 p.m.
The matinee is for the little ones. God bless
’em.
Con Drew, author of “.Tinker,” “The Do-
ings of Dave,” and other Australian novels,
has completed the scenario of ji film entitled
“The Trail of the Twang.” An Australian
movie co. is doing the rest at Rushcutters
Bay (N.S.W.), and if the pitcher is uf> to
the standard of Drew’s, racing yarns it will
do.
“J.F.11.” (London) : What films are most
popular in Australia? Topical stuff is all
the rage in London—in fact, the newest
picture-palace, in Leicester-square) is going
to screen nothing else. The syndicate be-
hind the enterprise is engaging photographers
in every continent, and arranging to have
their budgets brought to London by the
fastest mean’s of transit available. There is
a future for short historical films, but the
hectic American sex-problem drammer tot-
ters to a well-merited tomb. And there will
be no resurrection.
“Pedro” : Irene Vanbrugh, now Mrs. Dion
Boucicault, and reported about to descend
with Dot upon Australia, was here with
,T. L. Toole an seon back. She was then a
very tall, very bright and very young person;
and what prominent part she is to play in
“Sweet Lavender,” if that pretty little
comedy is produced here, as has been sug-
gested, puzzles rue. The ideal Sweet Laven-
der was Hilda Spong in her ululating youth,
and only an actress of that genre could do
anything with the part.
“Ibsenshaw” : While agreeing in the main
with “Dido’s” estimate of “Ambrose Apple-
john’s Adventure” (B. 15/8/’23), I may
remind him that the comedy is of American
origin. Its author is a native-of the U.S.A.,
and has obviously studied the tricks of the
playwriting trade as shown in his country-
men’s contributions to the latter-day stage.
The piece was originally entitled “Spanish
Treasure,” and under that name was tried on
the provincial dog in England before being
submitted to a London audience. Curiously
enough, the spoof “treasure” incidents in
“Applejolm” are handled in very much the
same way as in a well-known ’Murkan
comedy, “Captain Ividd, Junior.” There is
nothing new under the Stars and Stripes. I
attribute the success of “A.A.A.” in England
to the genius of Charles Hawtrey, who is not
only a comedian without a peer, but one of
the finest of producers. Hawtrey, hy the
way, on the last night of the recent revival,
remarked with pride that he had not given
his dnderstudy a chance during the 600-odd
performances of the play. And Charles is
over 60.
“G.”: Why is smoking prohibited in the
music-hall? Max Beerbohm once wrote an
article to demonstrate that it was simply the
liberty to smoke that made the music-hall
more popular than the regular theatre. But
at many London classy shows, plays and
concerts, people are permitted to smoke, and
at the famous Old Vic. you may not only
have a cigar as you watch “Hamlet” or
“Julius Caesar,” but during an interval you
can go to a buffet at the back and indulge
with the proletariat in a hot pie or a long
beer. And Beethoven and Shakspeare thrive
all the better amid friendly tobacco smoke.
In our theatres, solemn temples of respecta-
bility, the interval was often the most en-
joyable part of the entertainment; but how
can anybody nowadays have a bright
thought on chocolates and soft drinks!
"Second Murderer”: O. P. Heggie, the
Adelaide bank clerk, who is now a big
theatrical sachem in the land where prohi-
bition isn’t, was a very delicate young man
when he started mumming with William P.
Hawtrey in Australia. Heggie was the
Messenger in “A Message from Mars,” and
Dick in “Tom, Dick and Harry.” There was
a curtain-raiser to the latter piece, “A High-
land Ldgacy,” in which Heggie was an
angry father, but in Maoriland the strain of
two parts in one night made him crack up
rather badly, and he was relieved of one of
them. His throat was always weak, and he
had a sort of raspy utterance. Apparently
he has overcome his early disability. Per-
haps it’s the dry climate.
“Nella”: “Snell’s” reference to Henry
Bracy reminds me of what a tailor-made
man the dapper tenor was. Once when we
arrived in Sydney from Maoriland with the
Royal Comics, Bracy nearly wept because
his portmanteau had gone astray. He posi-
tively bleated in his anguish, and had the
steamer overhauled from clue to ear-ring in
a search for his lost property. “I’ve not u
rag to wear,” he wailed, “and I have to
meet Mr. Williamson at 12. llow can I
possibly call on him in these clothes?” At
the moment he was easily the sprucest and
best-dressed man on the ship.
"Cmsar's Ghost”: William James, the
young Australian musician and compose],
who went to Loudon just before the war, is
coming back to represent the music-publish-
ing firm of G. Riccordi and Co. in Australia.
With his wife, fcsaffo Arnuv, a dramatic
soprano, he will give some recitals under
the Tait management. .Tames achieved suc-
cess with a number of compositions in Ixm-
don, and, as he is only 28, he should go a
long way.
"C. Odkne.v”: I also have seen Edwin
Booth play “Hamlet’ (IT. 1/'S/’2S), and re-
call the attempt as uninspired and uninter-
esting—what the profession dubs "a good
actor’s performance.” It was. at the Lon-
don Princess’s, over 30 years ago. Cer-
tainly Booth was vilely supported by a
hastily-gathered troupe of English players,
mostly square pegs iu round holes, but it
was the much-boomed star’s own fault that
he made so little impression oh the London
audience. it was the same with whatever
he essayed. His Shylock, King Lear, Ber-
trucci ("Fool's Revenge”) and Othello were
all on the same level of mediocrity, and the
public signified its appreciation in the usual
manner. Henry Irvmg, then at the height
of his fame, gracefully invited the Ameriqau
to appear with him at the Lyceum. Bat
the adventure only served to send the Irving
stock higher. “Othello” was the play, and
Edwin and Henry agreed to take the name
part and lago on alternate nights. At the
opening performance Irving played lago, and
so brilliant was his rendering that Booth’s
Moor was hardly in the picture.
“Gnarek”: I am surprised at “Thorold"
(B. 8/3/’23) locating “Lilac Time” at
’Ammersmith. There is a Lyric Theatre in
Shaftesbury-avenue, as well as the Lyric in
King-street, ’Ammersmith, where Drink-
water’s. “Abraham Lincoln” and “The Beg-
gar’s Opera” have made long-distance re-
cords. The West End Lyric’s association
with highbrow stuff goes no further than
Doris Keane’s “Romance” or “The Bird ot
Paradise,” both of which have been pre-
sented by our own soulful suppliers of
fashionable dramatic goods.
“Bendoc”: I went to our local pitcher-
theatre to see a perversion of Zane Greys
novel, “The Mysterious Rider.” The plot, as
Grey framed it, is laid in the pioneering days
of Arizona, but in the filmed atrocity motor-
cars speed across the screen, and the hero
wears a fashionable “pinchback.’ I‘ ie
heroine was consulting the latest in wristlet
watches when I left.
“De Oriel”: My acknowledgments to the
cheerful soul who worked a bit of color
into our Mallee (Vic.) newspaper:
Tillevs’ popular show has decided to ploy J 1!
lvaniva next l’ riday. The star is “The Child
(lavest Me” (in 8 parts) from the Paramount
Theatre, Melbourne. At popular prices.
“C.G.” : Bob Brunton, brother of Austra-
lia’s Dorothy, has passed out in London,
where he was holidaying. All the Bruntom
are in America now. Bob served in tne
A.1.F., and towards the end of the war was
on H.Q. in London. He did not return k>
Australia, but, going to America, plunged
into the picture business,_ and was making
way as a producer at the time of his death.
UNDRESSING THE STAGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
1 went to see the “Cairo” show:
An aldermanic person sat
Biside me in the second row,
Who argued, as he nursed his hat,
“The story’s rather thin, you know,
And Ali Shar is rather fat;
The girls, however, are petite.”
He valued grace before the meat.
But when the. “orgy” was revealed,
Anri down the stairs the nymphs came flock-
ing,
The old boy positively squealed,
“This nudity is simply shocking'!
Such lusciousness should be concealed —
Can't these poor wenches raise a stocking?
This shameless dishabille abashes”—
Sackcloth it needs, this show of Asche’s.

Reasons for Increase of Capital.
The increase of capital now sought is required for, among others, the fol-
lowing reasons: —
1. The further and thorough exploitation, in territories yet untouched,
• of machinery, etc., manufactured by the J. I. Case Threshing
Machine Co., in accordance with the Agency Agreement between
that Company and Commonwealth Agricultural Service Engineers
Limited.
2. The addition and extension of the Company’s engineering plant for
the' manufacture of motor and tractor spare parts rnd general engi-
neering work.
3. The general expansion of the premises and various activities of the
Company.
Statement of Profits.
The various activities of the Company have been marked by continual and satisfactory progress, as indicated
by the following report, supplied by the Company s Auditor, and covering its operations for the six months ended
31st December, % l922:—
(Copy.)
41 Brookman Buildings,
Grenfell Street, Adelaide,
20th January, 1923.
Messrs. Commonwealth Agricultural Service Engineers, Ltd.,
53-57 Morphett Street, Adelaide.
Dear Sirs,
I have examined the accounts at Head Office, together
with statements from Branches, and after providing for depre-
ciation on plant and machinery, writing down preliminary
expenses and making provision for all contingencies, I esti-
mate the nett profit of the Company’s operations for the period
Ist July, 1922, to 31st December, 1922 at not less than
£12,300.
Owing to the late arrival of machinery, consequent upon
the railway strike in America, I have been unable to include
in the above estimate a further nett profit of approximately
£5,225 on orders received during the half-year ended 31st
December, 1922, and this profit will be included in the
accounts for the current half-year.
The sum of £lO,OOO in 10,000 fully paid up shares of £1
each, representing payment for Agency rights, spread over
two years from Eagle Motors Ltd., has not been taken into
account when arriving at the above estimates of profit. £5,000
of this amount has already been received.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) F. M. HARDY, A.I.C A., Auditor.
The Directors have already recommended an interim dividend of 10 per cent., and a copy of the Balance
Sheet as at 21st February, 1923, may be inspected at the Registered Offices of the Company
It is desired to point out that the substantial progress of the Company has been achieved by the sale of prac-
tically only one line of goods, namely, the 15/27 Case Kerosene Farm and General Purpose T ractor, and are
of opinion that this valuable acquisition to the farmer is filling a national want.
Full Circular and Application Forms can be obtained from any of the Branch Offices of the Company,
-where also the Balance Sheet can be inspected. Applications for Shares can be made to any member of the Stock
Exchanges of Australia, or to the Branches direct.

terribly realistic picture:—
our Youth is a beautiful, lovely time,

Boys and Girls flirting, believing like, fools ;

“Macshe” : Touching the statement (B.
l/3/’23) that Farrell, M.L.A V and ex-
pedagogue, won a record for Queensland by
putting 28 boys successfully through the
scholarship exam. The record pass for one
teacher is 63 out of a class of 63 boys from
the old Normal School, Brisbane, in 1918.
Farrell’s was a country school, certainly,
and there’s a heap of difference between that
and the city Normal.

“Pat Bushie”: lie “Stellsby” (B. 22/2/’23)
on the law of women’s property and the dis-
tribution of intestate estates. In N. S.
Wales, if a woman holding a publican’s
license marries, the license automatically
attaches itself to the husband. Should the
husband die she has to go through a lot of
legal routine prior to applying to the Court
for the return of what is really her own
license to herself.
“Haka” : The first shipment of Australian
wool was made in 1807, and consisted of a
consignment to J. Bull of 2451 b. In 1912
the world’s total production was estimated
at 2,880,859,5111 b., of which Australia and
Maoriland, with a total of 863,488,8261 b.,
produced about 30 per cent. The first
auction sale of wool in Australia was held
in Sydney on September 23, 1843, when
T. S. Mort submitted a catalogue of two
bales.

“Wart”: Re “Yardley’s” advocacy (B.
22/2/’23) of storing apples in thatched pits.
Cool storage was always found costly by
Tas. orelmrdists, and there was a big per-
centage of waste. Now many of them are
excavating storage chambers in the sides of
hills, and the fruit keeps better than in cool
store. The first cost is the last, and apples
can be held till midwinter, and shipped to
Sydney when fruit is scarce. One Tamar
grower has built a well-ventilated concrete
storehouse; last season he stored Sturmer
apples until November with less than 1 per
cent, of loss.
* * * *
“Rotom”: N. S. Wales State school-
teachers have been notified that the Public
Service Board has decided that the annual
value of “vested” residences shall be re-
assessed as from March 1, and an increase,
amounting in some cases to 70 per cent.,
has been made in the rents the teachers have
to pay. The decision is unfair and inequit-
able. Only married men occupy the resi-
dences, and the single teacher, therefore,
evades this heavy punch. The teacher must
rent the vested residence attached to his
school, though in many country places he
could obtain a better home at half the rent.
And in a lot of instances the shacks pro-
vided, not having been kept in decent repair
by former occupants, are so dilapidated that
no Fair Rents Court in existence would
sanction the increased charges.

“L.S.” (Canada) : In my last batch of
Bulletins I found some hard things said
about the quality of Australian exports,
apparently arising out of disparaging
remarks by Oscar Asche. Yet in the U.S.A.
I could give instances of Australian goods
being keenly appreciated. In San Francisco
one night my American hostess left the table
in order to bring in what was to be a treat
for me. I was becoming accustomed to
Yankee gastronomic “treats,” and was agree-
ably surprised to find this one was a dish of
Australian fig jam. That, too, in the land
where local fruit is more boosted than any-
where else in the world. At another time a
Californian hostess told me it was a pity
Australia exported so little butter, for, unless
she went to the shop for hers on the day they
unloaded, the shipment was always sold out.
Without advertising, too —just on its merits.
“David”: I’d heard so often of the old
confidence trick with the just-found diamond-
ring that I didn’t turn a hair the other
day when a beery, blear-eyed ancient fell at
my feet in the orthodox manner in East
Melbourne, with the old familiar exhibit in
bis paw. “My oath, there’s er bit er luck
fer yer,” he said, “an’ I wus jest
dyin’ fer er drink.” I said I sup-
posed he wanted to sell it. “My oath,
I dunno much about the valer er them
things, but you can have it fer 10 bob.”
To be marked down as the mug by such a
greasy derelict made me mad and 1 hurled
several pieces of assorted language at him.
lie thought 1 was annoyed at the price and
came down 55., but I glared at him in
bitterness and walked off in disgust. Next
morning I saw an advertisement describing
the ring, specifying the locality, and offering
£5 rewax-d.
“Sucre” : Figures furnished by the Direc-
tor of Sugar Experimental Stations in
Bananaland show to what an extent An-
tonio and Giuseppe are getting hold of the
cane industry in N. Queensland. For
example:—Macnade Mill, Ingham—Farmers
supplying cane: Italians, 47.4 p.c.; British,
35.0 p.c. Cane-cutters: Italian, 90.5 pm.;
Bi-itish, 7.9 p.c. Victoria Mill, Ingham—
Cane-cutters: Italian, 70.3 p.c.; British,
25.0 p.c. The others are mostly Spaniai'ds,
Greeks and Russians. The pay is good : few
of the Italians who are now farmers brought
any money to the country. But, as a rule,
the Australian is still shy of the industry.
The curse of the Kanaka is still upon it: there
is a vague idea in hundreds of thousands of
Australian heads that sugar-growing isn’t
a white man’s job—just as until the last
few years there was an idea in Sydney that
vegetable-growing wasn’t a white man’s job
because most of it was done by Chinese. The
white man has some queer superstitions.
“Pick”: The rep. of a Sydney estate-
agency firm recently struck the village in
which I help to roof the pubs. He brought
a cartload of lithographs setting forth the
attractions of a fashionable seaside resort.
A large area of residential blocks and busi-
ness sites, represented as fronting two well-
made roads, wei-e offered at from £6O to
£l5O per block —10 per cent, down and the
balance (with interest added) at £1 or up-
wai-ds per month. The firm would re-market
the blocks for cash purchasers who desired
to take advantage of a soaring market. So
plausible wei’e the arguments, so alluring
the plans that the whole ai'ea went off. A
month or two later one buyer took time off
to. have a look at his estate. He found it —
miles back in the bush ; the lithograph show-
ing roads and residences was as obvious a
fake as the plan of Eden that Martin
Chuzzlewit fell to. Most of the time-pay-
ment purchasers have backed out. and the
area reverts to the agents to be dangled be-
fore another set of credulous mugs. I sup-
pose all this has nothing to do with the
police. Robbery isn’t robbery if you put
enough pretty frills around it. -


Just Charming,
By “PHLOX.”
' A CAREER is all right, Audrey, as
far as it goes; but I don’t think
it is sufficient to satisfy the aver-
age woman’s -heart.”
“I suppose, Aunt, that’s why you gave
up your medical practice and married Uncle
Edward.” •
“Yes. I was getting on in years when I
married. I had begun to feel that want of
companionship with someone I could really
call my own—someone who was more to me
than a friend.”
“Those are my sentiments, Aunt. I feel
I have a more interesting career than most
women with a lectureship at the University
and my research work in archaeology, but
there’s something wanting.”
“And that something, my dear Audrey, is
a husband. I’ve been through the same thing
myself, and I know—it’s the same old story,
old yet ever new. I loved my profession as
you love yours, but alone it was unsatisfy-
ing.”
“Yes, Aunt. I realised that when I saw
Nita Anderson’s radiantly happy face as she
announced her engagement to be married;
then I realised that even a career does not
compensate for a life of single blessedness.
You remember that jolly girl who passed so
brilliantly in Arts! She’s going to marry
Professor Butler.”
“And I think, Audrey, it’s about time
you looked around for a husband. You’re
not cut out for an old maid, though of late
you’ve acquired one or two little prim ways,
and the average man does like a little bit of
fluffiness about a woman.”
"What do you mean?”
“I mean that you want to take more pains
with your general appearance; fluff out your
hair a bit, and so on.”
“But I don’t happen to have fluffy hair.”
“Then you’ve got to fluff it; also to im-
prove your skin; in fact, where Nature has
been deficient, supply the deficiency with
art. That’s what I do. But I promised
to meet Uncle at d o’clock, and it’s nearly
that now—l must be going. Good-bye,
Audrey, and think over what I’ve told you.”
Audrey Johnson was thinking over what
her practical aunt had suggested when she
was interrupted by someone wrapping on her
study door.”
“Come in,” she called.
Professor Livingstone’s pretty wife
entered. She had come to ask Miss Johnson
to join in a send-off to Nita Anderson.
After this had been satisfactorily arranged
they talked of all kinds of things.
Audrey had often noticed what pretty,
fluffy hair Mrs. Livingstone had, and how
beautifully she dressed it. Why not ask
her for some hints on hairdressing?
Mrs. Livingstone felt quite flattered at be-
ing asked for advice by clever Miss Johnson.
“So much depends,” she told her, “on the
way the hair is shampooed as to whether
the hairdressing will be a success. Per-
sonally, I always use Stallax,” said Mrs.
uvingstone, “and I find it makes the hair
beautifully glossy, fluffy and easy to dress.”
“And that’s just what I want,” replied
Miss Johnson.
“Do you ever use a hair tonic?”
“No, I’m afraid I’ve never given much
thought to my appearance, but I intend to
turn over a new leaf in that respect.”
“I can give you a recipe for a simplq,
home-made tonic. You buy a package of
boranium from the chemist, mix it with
a quarter of a pint of bay rum, anu rub into
t/e_scalp occasionally.
“Do you know,” went on bright little
Mrs. Livingstone, “a little while ago I was
getting quite grey, and I happened to hear
a woman in a chemist’s shop ask for two
ounces of concentrate of tammalite and three
ounces of bay rum to mix with it. She
then turned to her friend and said that there
was nothing like it for restoring grey hair to
its original color. I thereupon ordered the
same, and now I haven’t the sign of a grey
hair.”
“I’m glad to know of that, too, for I’m
continually pulling grey hairs out of my
head.”
“But, Miss Johnson, when you begin to
look after your hair you must also look
after your skin, and I find that there’s
nothing like mercolized wax for keeping the
skin soft, clear and free from blemishes.”
“My aunt was telling me that I badly need
a skin food, but she didn’t tell me what to
use.”
“All the well-preserved women I know
seem to use mercolized wax. It contains
oxygen, and removes the old worn-out skin
so imperceptibly and painlessly that you
don’t know the process is going on until
some fine day one of your friends will re-
mark, ‘I don’t know what you’ve been doing
to your skin, but it’s like a baby’s.’ ”
“Then, that’s certainly the cream for me.”
“Well, if you care to come round to my
place when you have time I will show you
a pretty way of dressing your hair. xSelieve
me, my husband always keeps me up to the
mark, and is delighted to hear people whis-
per as we pass, ‘Look! isn’t she just charm-
ing?' ”

M. 4,
Friction is
for Brakes
—not Bearings.
You have doubtless watched the sparks fly when
the brake imposes its binding grip on the wheels
of locomotives; and most likely you have been
delayed by the stopping of an entire train in order
to cool and lubricate just one hot, grinding journal.
In the one case friction is purposely applied to re-
tard motion —in the other, the train must be
stopped to eliminate the tremendous frictional drag
which would seize the bearing and stop the wheel
altogether if ignored.
This example of friction created by the brakes is
a homely exaggeration of the binding drag which
friction imposes on a. line of shafting equipped
with plain bearings. This frictional drag must
be overcome, as well as the binding and sticking
due to deflected shafts, which cause the bearings
to run hot and often seize with destructive effects
comparable to hot journals on railway trucks. Alto-
gether approximately 40 per cent, of the total
power supplied to a line of shafting is wasted in
overcoming this frictional drag.
Power expended in overcoming friction does not
disappear without a trace. In lineshaft bearings
it is dissipated in heat and in wear. Hot bearings
become a fire risk, plant efficiency is weakened and
the power waste curtails profits and cuts deep into
dividends.
Ball Bearings.
SKF self-aligning ball bearings deliver their full quota of power to
your machines, with a 60 per cent, saving of friction load, or a net saving
of from 15 per cent, to 35 per cent, of the total power supplied. Ask us
at our Showroom to prove these facts.

B. R. Gelling, of Sydney, is one of those
all-rounders who do public work without pay
oj spotlight. Formerly a man of insurance
and actuarial importance, and often con-
sulted by Governments about finance, also an
alderman, and belike a Mayor, he is now the
real governing mind in the N.S.W. Benevo-
lent Society, the _ biggest charitable institu-
tion in Australasia. He is a farmer in his
spare time, secretary of the Rotary Club,
and one of the best men at a social round-up.
“Caveman”: Tell “Sierra” that the name
“graveyard watch” is still commonly used
in ships that travel with the winds of the
Lord. But the name refers to the morning
watch, not the middle watch. Sailors in the
first and middle watches (8 p.m. to 4 a.m.)
have chances in the darkness to snatch odd
bits of sleep, if the weather suits. But in
the “graveyard watch,” just before dawn,
drowsiness must be fought, although it is
even more in evidence. The word “grave-
yard” carries its own meaning. It is the
“yawning” watch.
“Harold Hardupp”: While Neville Howse
went to Orange (N.S.W.), his brother
Oswald practised in Sydney, for a long tyne
in College-street, recently in Macquarie-
street. He died a week or so ago. My first
encounter with him was 17 years back, when
he examined me on behalf of an insurance
co. I had been going on the idea of a short
life and a merry one. “I’m interested in
your case,” he remarked cheerfully. “Come
back in three months—-if you’re still alive.”
Ten years after that I was passed for active
service. And now Hoxvse himself —a bluff
and hearty man with a wide popularity—is
gone.
“Exul”: That the work of Australian
scientists abroad is .not properly appreciated
in their own country is shown by the recent
Bulletin discussion as to whether syphilis
existed in ancient Egypt or not. Until
Grafton Elliot Smith, of Sydney, became
Professor of Anatomy at Cairo, certain
lesions in the bones of mummies were held
by many authorities to be syphilitic. Smith,
however, proved conclusively that they were
due to the post-mortem ravages of beetles.
The generally-accepted theory that syphilis
was brought to Europe from Hayti by the
sailors of Columbus is almost unassailable.
“The Deacon”: Talk of kids’ nerve! A
favorite pastime—now sternly discouraged
by the railway authorities —to which school-
boys of Penrith (N.S.W.) were wont to
“dare” one another was to climb down tne
railway line, through the vents between the
sleepers, and crawl out on to the big carved
stone piers over the Nepean River Bridge.
There, with a sheer drop of 60 feet to the
water, adventurous youth would cling to a
few inches of space while a big mountain
express roared overhead. An incidental
shower of hot ashes sometimes gave an extra
thrill to the operator. Can any adult view
the feat with the same cheerful serenity?
“Fidsom”: It has been suggested that in
the remote event of the Federal Parliament
being equally divided on the matter of
appointing a Speaker, the unfortunate Clerk
of the House (who, of course, is a paid offi-
cial without any political consequence) would
have to give a casting vote. The subject has
never yet come up in the Federal sphere, but
the Vic. Assemldy nearly faced the em-
barrassing position 30 years ago. Tummy
Bent was having a neek-and-neek sprint for
the Speakership with Wrixon, and the late
Jenkins, who was Clerk at the time, thought
he would be called upon for a decision. But
on division Rent scraped in by a couple of
votes. .
“The Deacon”: Though young Eugene
Brauer, as recorded in a recent Bulletin,
is the first Australian-trained cleric in the
Cardinal’s College to reach the presidential
chair, many other Australians have been in
the professorial line. The first Dean was
Reginald Bridge, who later on left his £5OOO
share of the family cash to give the workers
of Erskineville a church. Certainly Bridge
was educated at Rome. His successor was
Michael Flemming, of a well-known Sydney
family, and educated at Manly. On the
staff Arthur Hogan, from Cooma, is easily
one of Australia’s foremost mathematicians.
Yet there is the curious anomaly of a young
Irishman being appointed Diocesan Inspec-
tor of Schools in the Archdiocese!
The N. S. Wales State trawling industry,
which was as much the infant of George
Fuller as of the Labor party, went definitely
out of business at the end of February, when
284 men found their occupation gone, and
the last of the shops, opened with much ora-
tory by Ministers of other days, closed with a
bang. The best that can be said for the
venture is that it did for a time provide a
certain number of people with fish at reason-
able prices, and forced the Dago brigands to
some sort of reason. Even for that, of
course, the taxpayers, as a whole, had to
pay, and finally extravagance and incompe-
tence reached such a pitch that it became
obvious the price was too heavy. So that
the passing of the catch-vote enterprise
evoked but the faintest protests, even from
its founders.
The Rev. W. B. Boyce, whose portrait by
John Longstaff has been presented to the
Uni. of Sydney, was the president of the
first Wesleyan Conference in Australia—it
was held in 1855 in the old church in York-
street. He died on March 8. 1889, aged
84. Prior to coming to Australia as “super-
intendent” in 1846. he had served his church
in S’Africa for 13 years. One of his
daughters married the late George Wigram
Allen; another became the wife of J. H.
Stewart of Mount Pleasant, Bathurst.
Though he had no University training, his
scholarship put him in the first Senate of
the University, and his wide knowledge of
books led him on to the first library com-
mittee. In that first Senate, besides “the
men like Denison, Darvall, Therry, Nichol-
son and Wentworth,” mentioned by Dr.
Prescott at the unveiling, there were Edward
Broadhurst, Q.C., “father of the. N S. Wales
Bar,” who had been a first-class man in
classics at Cambridge; S. A. Donaldson,
afterwards first Premier; Dr. Davis,
coadjutor to the R. C. Archbishop Folding;
Edward Deas Thomson, Edward Hamilton,
M.A., F. L. S. Merewether, Auditor-Gen.;
Bart O’Brien. M D : John Hubert Plunkett,
Q.C.i and Rev. W. Purves (Presbyterian).
It was observed at the time that while the
ILC.’s, Presbyterians and Wesleyans were
represented by clergy the Anglmans had
only la ymen in the Senate.

Rexona Stops
Skin Troubles.
Skin eruptions are dangerous if neglected, and might easily
become chronic unless given careful attention.
There is no better treatment than to apply Rexona the Rapid
Healer. It is an antiseptic healing Ointment, containing just the
right cooling, soothing, healing properties which are needed to
rid your skin of all impurities.
If you suffer from Piles, Eczema, Bad Legs, Varicose Veins,
Ulcers, Ringworm, Painful Sore Feet, Prickly Heat, Sores on the
Head or Poisonous Wounds, Rexona will bring you prompt relief.
If you have tried many old-fashioned Ointments and been
disappointed, try Rexona, and you will be delighted with the
results.
Rexona soothes pain, builds up new flesh tissues, and renews
and heals the skin. A triangular pot of Rexona, with its healing,
soft, green Ointment, should be kept handy on the dressing-table,
so that every member of the family can have access to its wonderful
healing powers.
In triangular tins only, at 1 /6. Large size, 3/-.

* * The flying wheel?
Fire under water a man kindles ;
And a man moulded the steel.
The flames strive as a man has striven —
Sinew of fire and burning heel —
And all drive as themselves are driven,
Driving each other and driving the wheel.
In the black coal is the force of the fire,
The cry of the steam,
The pent throb of a far desire,
And the pain of a dream
That was old when the world began
To bear the burden of man.
Greatly the wild, red sun
Looked on the world outspun,
Broken from mastery
And the roar of his quenchless will
The long gleaming sea,
The valley under the hill
And the moon, a newcomer,
Shining and chill,
Gliding over the summer,
t'ool of green leaves
And cool of deep waters
Fnder cool cloud eaves
Flashing arrowy rain
On the sea’s mountain daughters—
The streams running cool to the plain.
Greatly the wild, red sun
Dreamt fire of fire,
Fury of flame to run
In the day of desire
Over a mastered world,
Till the scarlet flower
Of his passionate heat unfurled
Burned soaring and vast
To ruin that shouted of power,
Drowning the green past.
Long was that wooing of flame;
But the summer only took toll
Of blown kisses, made distance tame
For six millions of shining years.
And the long soft valleys stole
Green from the rain and the light,
Making long living and dying,
Day sleep and a tremulous sighing
That faded into the night
And the hard dreaming of coal.
Sun-lust, heavy and cold,
Buried under the hill,
Shall the last defeat be told
Of a scorched and ashen will?
Rut who shall lull a dream to sleep,
Though the bed be a thousand ages deep?
I have seen the sun driving the wheel
In a fury of smoke and steam—
Sinew of fire and flaming heel—
As Apollo drove his team.
Not yet is the dust of the dream ;
For after the loud, red burning
And the cry of the tortured turning
Of steel upon steel,
Shall there be triumph of coal?
Shall the lust of a dead sun drive a. man
To the death that was ere the weed began
If the wheel turn on his soul?
But when shall a, man’s full dream be done
If in passion he dream it well,
A god-light over the highest sun
And a fear-depth under Hell?

Ellerslie's Case.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
CORA her name was, and Ellerslie, Dis-
trict Commissioner, and brand-new in
his job, got his first glimpse of her atop
of an aged piebald mare, so hnng with bags
and bundles that only its lugubrious head,
its sparse tail and its lean, long legs seemed
to emerge from the general effect. She
jogged into view round the sunlit road where
it curved through a cluster of native huts,
and as she came a score of yelping dogs
snapped at the heels of her melancholy
mount. The din was deafening; the ancient
mare leaped astonishingly into the air, and
a breadfruit and half-a-dozen eggs went
hurtling to the ground. Women and child-
ren came running; there was a babel of
tongues, and above it the clear voice of the
girl in angry Fijian as she slashed unavail-
ingly at the dogs. It was then that Ellers-
lie came timely to her assistance. She was
laughing when between them all they had
driven off the snarling curs. It was not
till then that he got a clear impression
of her. Before, there had been too much
confused clamor and whirling movement.
He saw her now, a fair-haired, sun-browned,
buoyant girl in a khaki riding-skirt and a
white blouse, low at the tanned throat, and.
with a buy’s white cricketing-eap pulled
tightly over her forehead. She looked down
at the wreckage.
“I’m afraid they’re past hope,” he said
regarding what remained of the eggs and
the breadfruit —it had been rather a ripe
one—trampled almost to a pulp. "But might
I help with the rest of your goods?”
“For Heaven’s sake don’t touch anything,”
she cried out in genuine alarm. “They’re only
balancing now—just balancing. But I have
not much farther to go. Only for you every-
thing would have gone—to-night’s dinner
and all. And I have not even said ‘Thank
you.’ ”
She smiled rather shyly down at him.
It was on the next day he chanced on
her home. He had risen early and ridden
out in the dawn. The tide was low, and
in the long brown reaches of sand a myriad
pools_ were stained red. Following the un-
familiar road around abrupt headlands and
beneath overarching trees, he saw in a
straggled clearing a low-roofed house stark
m the sunshine. Flanking it were a couple
of native bures; in front of one of them a
dark-skinned child was intent on mud pies.
A young woman, unmistakably
was fondling the piebald mare tethered by
the door, and as he passed the girl of yester-
day came with bare feet and bare head
out of the house. He saw her shrink back
as she caught sight of him —he could have
sworn a wave of color flushed her. It was
clear enough she did not wish to be per-
ceived. He rode on.
“A half-caste house!” ran his thought to
the brisk tune of the horse’s hoofs. “But
I’ll swear she’s none. A damned shame !”
The place had a queer fascination for him.
He rode that way often, but he saw no more
of her. The little dark-skinned child smiled
up at him now and waved her hand when
he passed. He saw more than once a loung-
ing, not ill-featured half-caste smoking and
reading on the tumbledown verandah. Occa-
sionally the young woman, buxom in loose
wrappers, who eyed him with frank interest.
Once a slack-bodied, red-faced man of 60
or so, snoring in a canvas chair in the shade
of one of the native bures. But though he
did not see the girl he was sure that she
knew of his passing, that deliberately she
drew back into the half-caste home in which
she went familiarly.
It was queer how her image persisted in
his mind. He was young; there was per-
haps a little too much of the romantic in
his composition. That sudden shrinking
withdrawal of hers remained in his memory ;
he saw her, an Andromeda-like figure, chained
to a life he was ready to surmise she hated.
Ilis interest grew the keener, perhaps, be-
cause the station was a lonely one; there
were full enough days, but as yet he had
not got accustomed to the long evenings in
the quiet, echoing house, while the wind in
the palms outside was like the sound of end-
less rain.
The girl herself, centre of all the mystery,
would have laughed rather bitterly at the
thought that any .such quality clung about
her. It was all sordid enough, commonplace
enough to her—“just life,” she might have
put it if she had thought at any length
about the matter. But undoubtedly it was
a queer household; queer enough even in
Fiji. There was old Thomas Rose, her
father, widowed twice and now going com-
fortably down his latter undignified days
with a strip of a plantation barely paying
and worked inadequately, and a thirst that
was perennial. His first wife had been a
native girl. She had died and left two big-
eyed toddling mites to his indifferent foster-
ing—a boy and a girl, Tim and Grade ; Kelesi,
the Fijian tongue made it. Two years later
he married again—this time a white woman,
a strayed, tired governess, who had drifted
God knows how to the remote district. She
faded, not regretfully, out of life not long
after Cora’s birth. The household, that
under her had kept something of order,
slipped easily again into slack ways. It
was in this casual setting that the girl Cora
grew to her young womanhood.
Reeded walls and sunlight and the croon
of an island lullaby—those were the first
conscious impressions of her life. Those
and the wrinkled, dark face of Salote, her
Fijian nurse. Fijian, indeed, she spoke first
—with Tim and Kelesi she ran wild through
her picturesque childhood. Of lessons there
had been little. Somehow they learned to
read and write; their education had gone
very little further. Her unusual upbringing
had tinged the mind of Cora : much clung to
it of Fijian Superstition, it reflected the
sometimes lax point of view of the half-
caste, and with it all, beneath the surface,
there was a fierce, vehement pride in her
blood that Was clean white. A pride that,
strangely enough, Tim and Kelesi upheld in
her. For all that she shared their life and
thoughts, they set her unconsciously a little
apart—there .was always the merest, faint-
est shade of subtle difference. It was an
instinctive sense that, though she was bound
to them by the tie of blood, she was not
altogether their kind. Honestly fond of her,
they were also more than a little proud.
Kelesi had been five years married now.
A big laughing child, marriage had barely
changed her, though she was 28 and a
mother. Her husband was a half-caste —an
indolent lounger through life, between whom
and Tim the brother there were frequent
bickerings. Each of them was supposed to
have some share in the management of the
plantation; between them both, and under
the lax supervision of old Thomas Rose, the
place went every year nearer to inevitable
ruin.
Three months had gone by since Ellerslie
had been in residence. The image of the
girl had faded a little in las mind, till, riding-
home in the red sunset of one breathless
afternoon, he came full on the disreputable
figure of old Thomas Rose lying mud-spat-
tered and in maudlin tears by the roadside.
Beside him a bottle smashed in the fall bore
eloquent testimony to his grief. A little
way from him grazed all unconcerned the
piebald mare.
Ellerslie reined up to take in the situa-
tion. Old Rose looked up at him, and broke
into fresh tears.
“Poor oF Tom !” he said through his dole-
ful hiccoughs; “poor ol’ Tom ish dead. Was
a good sort, oF Tom.” And he -wept over
the melancholy thought of his own self-
announced demise.
“You’re not dead yet. old chap, however
much you ought to be,” Ellerslie informed
him. “But. no mistake, you’re dead drunk.
I expect I’ll have to get you home.”
He dismounted and caught the piebald
mare, but the task of getting old Rose, un-
wieldy, almost helplessly drunk, into the
saddle was not easy. Somehow, after a
series of slips and bumps and protests, he
got him up. The piebald mare, as one not
unaccustomed to the proceedings, took the
weighty proposition meekly. But once well
up Elierslie found it still something of a
problem to keep his man steady. The won-
der was he had got as far as he had. He
lurched from side to side, his head began
to sag- downwards as he drowsed, and only
for Ellerslie’s firm grip lie. would have slid-
den countless times to the ground. For
Ellerslie, leading the two horses and sup-
porting the old man, it began to be like a
nightmare journey. A queer way too of
establishing relations with- the girl herself,
he began to reflect half-humorously, by
trundling her drunken father across the
threshold !
It was dusk before the lights of the house
he sought gleamed ahead of him. At his
call a medley of folk poured from it. A
Fijian fled for the kitchen lantern, and after
him, bellowing abuse, came the enraged
Tongan cook.
He was to remember always her shamed
look. Kelesi, voluble, flew to the old man,
how blinking foolishly in the wavering lan-
tern light. She scolded vigorously, she
coaxed, and between her slouching husband
and herself the old man was half-led, half-
carried into the house. Tim, always acutely
shy and rather at a loss in emergencies,

Is Backache
Crippling You?
Is that dull, nagging backache making it hard for you
to get around? Are you lame, sore and tortured with
sharp rheumatic pains at every step? It’s time, then, you
gave some attention to your kidneys! Nature, you know,
has a way of warning you when all is not right with the
bodily machinery. A dull, persistent backache is one
of her first signals of kidney weakness. You may have
. . daily headaches, too, with dizziness and annoying
bladder irregularities. You are depressed and nervous —worn out and miserable. You feel years older
than you are. AX/hy let this condition continue? Kidney troubles, if treated early, are usually easily
corrected. Neglected, the way is paved for fatal kidney disease. Don t take this risk! Begin now
with Doan s Backache Kidney Pills. Doan s have helped thousands and should help you. Ask your
neighbor.
SYDNEY MAN CURED.
Mr. H. Holder, 235 West Street, North. Sydney, says:—“Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
are indeed a wonderful kidney medicine.- I have proved this. For a long time I suffered
agony from backache and kidney trouble, and only those who have been afflicted in this way
have any idea what I went through. My limbs swelled considerably, the kidney secretion's
were thick and cloudy, with a red sediment, and I had agonising pains in my back. When I
stooped it was as much as I could do to stand up straight again without' assistance; mv
back was so stiff! and lame. I was treated by a doctor, and tried all sorts of remedies, but
nothing gave me the slightest relief. I was naturally very worried about the serious state of
my health, and when Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were brought under my notice I decided
to try them. It was a grand thing for me that I got this remedy, for seven bottles cured me
completely. I cannot speak too highly of Doan’s Pills, and recommend them with every
confidence to other sufferers.”
Six years later Mr. Holder says:—“l have still the same good opinion of Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills. They cured me of kidney disorder six years ago, and I have had no return
of the complaint since.”

under pretence of unsaddling the piebald
mitre vanished into the darkness.
But Cora herself had offered no assistance.
If she felt disgust or resentment after that
one shamed glance she did not show it.
She stood quite still—in the yellow lantern-
light she looked young and very forlorn.
The ' Good Samaritan felt rather a fool.
And then all at once her face quivered into
tears; she put her hands up blindly and
turned. He caught at her arm.
“Don’t, don’t!” he said, something more
than quick pity in his tone. “You’ve avoided
me so long. Won’t you just be friends?”
They clasped hands on the compact.
The affair deepened from that poignant
dusk. He began to find her friendship a
daily need ; romance was quick in him, her
unique situation invested her in his eyes
with some alluring quality of mystery. In
reality she was no more than a lovable,
pretty girl, uneducated, not over-intelligent
and with a placid indifference to what hap-
pened outside her own immediate affairs.
But undoubtedly some glamor she threw
about him—he was held in the golden
threads of it.
Kelesi watched matters develop with an
unconcealed satisfaction.
“He is in love with you, Cora,” she said.
“Eilei, I know! But when is lie going to
ask you to marry him?”
Cora whirled round—she had been brush-
ing her hair at Kelesi’s mirror. She looked
wide-eyed at her half-sister reclining half-
dressed after her bath on the pile of mats
that formed her bed. The afternoon sun-
light streamed through the open door, mak-
ing shimmering patterns on the reeded walls
of Kelesi’s burr; Cora’s loose hair shone
in it; her very fairness was emphasised
by the brown of the other’s big, bare arms
and her round, good-natured face.
“Oh, Kelesi!” she said, struck by the
sudden thought, “lie would not think of such
a thing. Me!”
“Isa, and every day, every day he comes
to see you”
“What good am I to him?” Cora said,
suddenly and passionately. “He might as
well marry a Fijian girl.”
“You are white,” Kelesi affirmed. “A*
kai-loma | half-caste] for me—it doesn’t
matter. But not for you, Cora—you are
different. Tim and I—always we knew.
Oh,” she said, her face falling like a child’s,
“when you are married there won’t be any
time for us—we don’t belong at all.”
Her brown eyes misted—tears and laugh-
ter came always easily to Kelesi.
It was later in the same afternoon Ellers-
lie_ came to her. The shadows were length-
ening across tin 1 grass, and over the dilapi-
dated homestead after the heat of the long
day there was an enfolding peace. He had
a strange impression for a moment that he
was like a man drifting down calm waters
away from all the bracing surge of the open
sea. lie forgot it at sight of Cora in her
blue gown, with eyes that showed her wel-
come. “My dear, my dear!” he said for
the first time, and took her outstretched
hands. She paled, and tried to draw away.
But her look was wistful,
“You’ll marry me?” he said, still holding her.
But she began to cry heart-brokenly
against his shoulder.
"I’m not fit to be your wife,” she said.
“I don't know anything. Oh, I’m only like
a native girl, and I’m too old to learn now.”
Again she would have drawn away.
“Let me go,” she said, forlornly, “I’ll
never marry you. I’d only spoil your life.”
“You will marry me,” he said. “I’ve
never wanted anyone but you. Spoil my
life!”; —he laughed his scorn. “You will, ’
he said again, and kissed her.
But even while her soft lips were glad of
his, Ellerslie knew that, as far as his career
was concerned, it was ruin.
A. SMITH.
The Cock.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WITH the wind a couple of points
free, and as much of it as she
could stand up to, the Swallow
was barging her way across from King
Island to Queenscliff with a cargo of living
crayfish. A bluff-bowed schooner, capable of
driving a chip a mile before passing it, she
was now thundering along at seven knots,
and scooping up tons of Bass Strait over
her lee bulwarks. The helmsman had his
work cut out to steer a true course, for the
little vessel was bucking like a colt and
swinging her head through so many points
of the compass that Joe Burnie’s arms ached
as he clung to the wheel, easing 'her over the
combers and, occasionally, giving a furtive
glance at the antics of Portugee Tom, the
splay-footed old skipper.
Tom was working himself up into a state
of excitement over some disturbing element
that had appeared away on the lee bow. Ho
balanced his awkward frame against the main-
mast and took a bearing to leeward over the
edge of his hand; lurched aft and peered
into the binnacle, squinted under the foot of
the mainsail, then back to the mast for
another bearing; and all the time he kept
snapping his fingers, emitting half-smothered
chuckles, and showing every sign of sup-
pressed emotion. He was driving the
’ schooner as she had not been driven for
years, and, when she rose over the curling
seas, the helmsman caught a glisnpse, under
the arch of the mainsail, of the cause of his
excitement. (
About a mile away, on the lae bow, sails
gleaming and brightwork glittering in the
morning sun, the ■ crack Melbourne pilot-
schooner Mavis lay on a course parallel with
that of the Swallow, and was slowly but
surely dropping astern. As her graceful
hull rose and fell, and her shapely bows
burst into the seas, .Toe Burnie noticed that
she had her mainsheet eased off and her fore
staysail sheet bridled to windward. But that
fact—which had escaped Tom’s age-dimmed
eye—Joe prudently kept to himself. Apart
from the volcanic outburst of blasphemy to
be expected if he mentioned it, ,Joe reckoned
that if the Swallow could get clean away
from the Mavis before Tom noticed the re-
straining trim of that staysail, there would
be oceans of booze washing around Queens-
cliff when the old man recounted his victory
over the renowned pilot-yacht.
Portugee Tom’s faith in the sailing quali-
ties of his schooner was pathetic. Stowed
away in his little cabin —so tradition ran —
was a gaudily-painted, galvanised-iron rooster
which Tom used to flaunt at the mast-
head amongst the browsing ketches and
sloops of Bass Strait when he and the Swal-
low’ were young. But that was ages ago,
when she w T as a flash little ship and cargoes
were plentiful: ages before that bleak day
when Toni consented to have her dragged on
to the slip, her protective copper wrenched
off, and vent-holes bored in her body for the
accommodation of crayfish. The skippers of
the new clipper-schooners joked about
Tom’s rooster, and spoke slightingly
of the old Swallow; but Tom reckoned that
in a seaway, w’ith a fair slant and “plent
da wind,” the SwalloAv would drown the
new-fangled herrin’-gutted clippers. Modern
weather, however, seemed to suit the modern
ships, and the cock had slumbered below 7 for
30 years. Now, at last, the Swallow’s
chance had come. With “plent da wind,”
and from the right quarter, she was chal-
lenging the dizzy top-notcher of them all;
the haughty champion of the Strait!
Tom’s thoughts strayed to an old topmast
staysail he used to set when he had the name
of a cracker-on. If he could get it up and
bend it now, the schooner might carry it;
then she would show the la-de-das some-
thing ! But he was short-handed. The
other member of the crew—a stranger from
the Hobart timber-schooners —w T as down be-
low nursing a lacerated and poisoned hand,
caused through grasping a cray round the
middle as if it had been a bottle of beer.
Tom had to abandon the idea. He and the
helmsman had to work the ship between
them. No matter! Ue would show the
Tassie skippers how he could wallop the
champion with only half a crew.
Every rough bearing the old man took
brought the pilot-schooner broader on the
beam. There wrns no doubt about it; the
Swallow 7 was surely overhauling the Mavis!
Tom w r as openly exulting now. He seized a
long sweep and, calling down the hatch to
the crays to pull their legs in out of the vent-
holes, thrust it over the side of the vessel
allowing it to wash aft, knocking off the legs
and antennae of the crays that disobeyed his
order. «
“She go moosh queek now,” he cried, run-
ning aft after disciplining the crays.
“Watclia t’ Joe, watcha luff. Don’ letta
shake! Ha, ha! Da cracko da scheip! Da
finsha da yacht! Ha, ha! Da grreat Ma-veis!
He t’ink he beata da Swol’; by Cri’, I saila
da ring roun’!”
By this time the Mavis had dropped almost
dead abeam, and old Tom was radiant with
joy. Balanced on the reeling deck, with
feet planted far apart, he raised his puckered
face and looked aloft. From the foot of
the mast his eyes travelled upwards, past
the straining mainsail, beyond the swelling
gaff-topsail, to the masthead, where, tied
fast to the strumming halliards, a dead cray-
fish —Tom’s house-flag—rattled in the
breeze. His gaze rested on the cray. For
years it had been his custom to masthead
a large cray as a sign of a full ship, and it
had never suggested anything else to him;
but now it seemed to revive old memories.
He slowly raised his hand above his head,
brought it down with a mighty smack on his
thigh, and cried :
“By Gar, I hoista da cock!”
Trembling with excitement, lie pushed
back the companion slide and lowered himself
into the cabin.
When the old man disappeared below, the
helmsman cast a hasty glance over the
weather bow, where a white speck had ap-
peared on the horizon while Tom was con-
templating the mastheaded Cray. The speck
had rapidly developed into the bellying top-
sails of a square-rigger, inward bound. Joe s
vision of free booze in Queenscliff suddenly
vanished. He inwardly cursed the inoppor-
tune arrival of the deep-water ship. If, as
he surmised, the pilots were expecting her,
Tom’s chance of beating the Mavis was gone
for ever. He peeped under the mainboom.
Yes, the pilots had seen her too ! They had
hauled aft the mainsheet and let draw the
fore staysail, and the Mavis, lee rail under,
was tearing through the water, cascading
spray over half her length, and steering
a course diagonally across the Swallow’s bow.
A moment later, Portugee Tom emerged
from the cabin, clasping the precious rooster
to his breast. Carefully unrolling the can-
vas covering he held the emblem at arm’s
length and regarded it lovingly.
“Ha, dey laugh at da li’l’ SwoP!” he cried.
“Dey poka da fun at ol’ Tom! Now da cock
crow cock-a-doodle-00-00, on da li’l’ ol’ SwoP ;
hey, t’ Joe !”
He skipped to the weather rail to loose the
signal halliards; but the knot was never
untied. As he turned and faced forward
he caught sight of the Mavis, like a great
seabird, swooping over the seas in a cloud
of spume, and trailing a dazzling wake a
mile behind her. For an instant Tom stood
spellbound. The cock dropped from his shak-
ing hand and clattered across the deck to
the lee rail, where it lay, a splotch of vivid
colors on the wet planking. The old man’s
shoulders drooped. He stared at the Mavis,
and then gazed aloft with bewildered eyes.
The wind held from the same quarter; the
sails were ramping full; the thing seemed
inexplicable. His lips trembled.
“.Wha-da’s da matta, t’ Joe?” he quav-
ered, almost in a whisper.
Joe pointed to the square-rigger, now
plainly visible, shearing through the water to
windward.
“Goin’ to put a pilot aboard,” he said
brusquely.
Tom stood and watched the Mavis sail
across his bows. From the lee bow she
drew ahead, disappeared behind the Swal-
low’s jibs, and reappeared on the weather
bow. The humiliation of the Swallow was
completed.
Portugee Tom went slowly forward, bent
over the hatch, and called down to the crays
in a crooning voice:
“OrriglP, sticka da leg out, sticka da nose
out, orrigh’, orrigh’!”
Joe Burnie shook his fist at the square-
rigger, and spat a rich brown mixture over
the taffrail.
Tom stood irresolutely at the hatch, and
then turned aft. Smiling wanly at Joe, he
picked up the gaudy cock and cast it over
the side.

Comfortable, Graceful
Sensible, Healthful Corsets
IF YOU want to look your best, you
must be properly corseted—for no
woman ever looked well, or felt well
or appeared to the best advantage, if she
was wearing the wrong corset.
Is the corset you have on perfectly com-
fortable ? Does it exactly fit your figure ?
Or does it “ride up” on your body and
bulge the flesh at the waist, or push up
under the arms, or dig into your legs or do any of those distracting
things that make you uncomfortable and tire you out and give you
that ‘ ‘corseted look’ ’ that adds years to your apparent age ?
When you buy a corset you want one that is com for table, one that
will make most of the natural grace of your figure, one that will
wash well and wear well, one that will protect your health and eter-
nally guard you against the injustice of looking older than you are.
Buy a Gossard Corset
Twenty years ago Mr. Gossard discovered in Paris a new kind of
corset —a corset that laced in front, designed for herself by a
French Countess, the Countess Fould de Grasse. Because this
new principle in corsetry offered a protection to the health as well
as to the appearance, Mr. Gossard introduced it to the feminine
world, and the practical artistry of Gossard designers has devel-
oped it to its present perfection. Your own family physician will
agree with other undisputed medical authorities that the front lac-
ing Gossard is the only corset that will give you ideal support.
This matter of designing for your type is the whole secret.
Gossard artists, after studying thousands of women, classified them
into nine figure groups and created special models to take care of
the particular figure needs of each group. There are Gossard Cor-
sets created with just the support you need at your age and weight
to give you the proper proportions of the type to which you be-
long. Your Gossards will be differently proportioned and differ-
ently boned from the corsets created for the other figure groups.
Perhaps you have been buying your corset by waist measure alone.
That is a fatal mistake and one of the most common causes of cor-
set discomforts. If you want an exactly-right
corset, one that will always be comfortable,
one that will never need “breaking in,” all
you need do is to select a Gossard designed
for you. It is sure to fit you perfectly and
be absolutely comfortable every minute you
have it on.
Go to the Best Store YoiL Know
Do you realise for how little you can buy
these comfortable, graceful, sensible, beautiful Gossard Corsets?
You can get one for as little cost as the ordinary corset. But no*
matter what you pay, the Gossard corsetiere who fits you will
know types as well as corsets and will guarantee your satisfaction..
Gossard Brassieres
Gossard Brassieres like Gossard Corsets are designed for the needs
of the nine figure groups. The new Longerlyne models are priceless
to the woman who heretofore has been unable to find brassieres with
special shaping to support and flatten the diaphragm and with extra
length to prevent them from slipping up over the lower tops of
the modern corsets. Yet they are most reasonably priced within
the reach of every purse.

Australia responds to the New Superior
CHEVROLET
SO SPONTANEOUS has been the demand for
the New Superior CHEVROLET in America
that it has been found necessary to provide
for production of 2500 cars per day—just double the
production of a few months ago.
Already in Australia the response to the New
Superior has been remarkable. It is recognised as
incomparable in the quality class—because of its
smart lines, complete modern engineering, and
LOWEST OPERATING COSTS OF ANY FIVE-
PASSENGER MADE.
