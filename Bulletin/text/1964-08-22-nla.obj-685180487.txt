... the taste of friendship
There’s a murmur of approval when you reach for the St. Agnes Brandy.
Moments of friendship merit something just that little bit better. And
a wise guest appreciates the fact that you always keep a bottle of
St. Agnes especially for him.
St. Agnes Brandy is pure, clean and dry carefully twice distilled
through Pot Stills, then matured for a long time in small oak casks.
It’s reassuring to know that you have a bottle of St. Agnes in your
cupboard call for it at your local supplier,
distilled to be

LETTERS
TO THE
EDITOR
THE PILL
Sir,
In his letter (8/8/64), “A Catholic
Priest”, author of the article “A Catho-
lic Case for the Pill” (11/7/64), admits
my contention that Pope Pius XII was
more forthright in condemning the use
of oral contraceptives than he had
acknowledged. He should also have ad-
mitted that Father Peter Kelly, SJ, was
right in charging him with misquoting
Father Louis Janssens, of the Univer-
sity of Louvain, as “advocating the use
of the pill”. Father Janssens himself has
expressly denied that, saying that he no
more than tentatively suggested for dis-
cussion among professional theologians
the possibility of drugs suppressing ovu-
lation being a moral means of birth
regulation.
Also last May, in a Press conference
at Boston, USA, Cardinal Suenens, Arch-
bishop of Malines, Belgium (Father Jans-
sens’ diocese), said he had given Father
Janssens “liberty of research in order to
clarify the problem”, adding that while
the Church cannot change her doctrine
on birth control, a pill may become
available before long “which avoids
direct sterilisation” (a medical problem)
and “merely regulates natural functions”.
He expressed the opinion that, granted
a consensus of medical opinion not yet
available, this could be morally accept-
able.
My own letter, however, was wholly
concerned with “A Catholic Priest’s”
original contention that “the Church has
not made an official pronouncement yet”,
but that Catholics should be left free
‘to follow their own consciences in the
matter”; and I quoted Pope Paul VI as
insisting (a term fully justified in view
of his preceding utterances) that for the
time being the norms given by Pope
Pius XII are to be regarded as binding
and still in force.
Your contributor makes the excuse
that his article had “gone to print” (in
your 11/7/64 issue) before Pope Paul
Vi’s 23/6/64 decision. Your contribu-
tor’s implicit admission that he was
wrong in denying any official pronounce-
ment leaves it inexplicable that he did
not, in the intervening fortnight, request


Mr. Hiller
and his craft
THE IMPORTANCE OF A NAME
Mr. Ernest Hiller is a craftsman.
He makes suits with more than
ordinary care.
He takes a craftsman's pride in a
job well done. That’s why you’ll
find his own personal signature on
every suit he makes. It isn’t just
a brand name.
It’s Ernest Hiller’s personal guar-
antee to you.
It means your suit has been
tailored from the very finest fab-
rics. With the care and patience
Mr. Hiller demands.
It means you can buy the
latest international styles
for as little as £25.19.6.

a correction of his article before publi-
cation of it.
Instead, he now tries to undermine the
authority of the papal directive, quotes
two non-definitive contributions of a
priest and a doctor to the discussion
and, exemplifying the “muddle-headed-
ness” of which he resents being accused,
concludes that Catholics need such infor-
mation “to enable them to form their
consciences”; as if Pope Paul Vi’s de-
claration that until further notice Pope
Pius XIFs rulings are to be regarded as
still binding were not sufficient Catholic
guidance for that purpose.
Your contributor’s original assertion
that “many theologians want to impose
their views with complete finality on an
uninformed and uncertain laity” is
simply not true. These theologians fully
acknowledge that they themselves are
as subject as the laity to authoritative
papal pronouncements, and that they
have no right to impose decisions of
their own or give any advice at vari-
ance with such pronouncements.
I myself, with no reference to either
private or public theoretical discussion
of the subject, certainly did no more
than draw attention to the directive of
Pope Paul VI forbidding the use of oral
contraceptives as at present operative
for the practical guidance of Catholics,
thus making clear their conscientious
obligations in this matter.

“THE FUTURE OF WOOL"
Sir,
Congratulations on your article “The
Future of Wool” (1/8/64) in which you
give one of the best analyses of the pre-
sent set-up as far as the proposed
Reserve Price plan is concerned that the
writer has seen published.
Your writer does make the comment,
“should the scheme come in, the need
for private selling will be largely eradi-
cated”; this, however, is not correct.
The price of our wool fluctuates without
respect to any known factors of supply
and demand. For instance, persons
shearing their sheep today can sell their
wool at a net average of 66d. in the
shed for merino types (this is some Bd.
net above the theoretical reserve price
indicated by the report), but by the time
their wool comes up for sale in Sep-
tember it may average 70d. (70d. Mel-
bourne would only be equal to about
67d. net on the property). It may, of
course, average more; but it could even
come down to the reserve price, and the
grower could “do” Bd. per pound. Whilst
the writer is prepared to fully support
the recommendations of the marketing
committee it is felt that this clause
should be altered to forbid private sales
below the reserve price.
Whilst the initial price and the finan-
cial requirements are identical with
those that I have advocated for over
two years, the fact that in between time
the growers were talked into a promotion
levy of approximately 275. per bale
(plus 17s. per bale from the Govern-
ment) has, to my idea, made the hurdle
of financing more difficult.
There is no indication that the vast
increase in promotion money is needed;
sales have not been our trouble. We
have consistently since 1959 sold each
year more wool than we could produce,
but each year we have had unnecessarily
depressed prices. If the ironing out of
these depressed prices is going to mean
reduced consumption, then we will need
more promotion; but there is absolutely
no indication that high prices (within the
limits reached this year) caused any re-
duction in consumption.
If in the initial years of the proposed
marketing plan some of this excess pro-
motion money is used to create a bank
for financing possible “buy-in” of wool,
a vote in favor of the Reserve Price plan
will be a lot more certain.

DRAMA SCRIPTS
Sir,
Mr Richard Lane states (1/8/64) that
the Radio, Television and Screen Writers’
Guild has negotiated a very satisfactory
agreement with ATN in regard to the
writing of drama scripts. This must re-
fer to some vague future in which ATN
will buy drama scripts, rather as one
might make a wonderful deal to buy
property on the moon. What agreement
has the Guild negotiated with GTV,
which recently had a series “devised'’
by two English writers, adapted by one
Australian writer and is now in recess
“for lack of scripts” while two more
English writers “devise” some more? It
seems that Mr Lane and his Guild are
rather in the nature of ferocious paper
tigers.

THE DECIMAL SYSTEM
Sir.
Most Australians, like Mr J. F. Blades
(1/8/64), have restricted their decimal
thoughts to the naming of our unique-
sized decimal units, instead of seeking
an answer to the vital question: “If a
completely decimal currency is really
desirable how can we achieve it with a
minimum of confusion, inconvenience
and cost while still adequately catering
for the needs of all sections of our com-
munity?”
There is positively no sound reason
for attempting to abandon our present
decimally recorded pound. Our schools
have taught how to decimalise shillings
and pence since 1912 and the practica-
bility of a pound-based decimal currency
has been proved in Australia by its wide-
spread use in accounting and engineering
circles.
Our farthing, though not represented
by a coin, is our present minor unit of
currency, being used as the bidding unit

After the Games: where?
Straight home? But why? Wait-
ing between Tokyo and home is
the wonderland of South-East
Asia.
And Lufthansa to be your guide,
mentor and host.
After the Olympics, Lufthansa
can whisk you from Tokyo to
the most storied cities of the Far
East. Bangkok. Hong Kong.
Karachi. Calcutta. New Delhi.
It will fly you in a splendid Boe-
ing 7208, exclusive in South-East
Asia to Lufthansa or a 707
Intercontinental, largest and most
powerful Boeing 707 in service.
In flight you enjoy such genial
touches of German hospitality as
beer from the keg, Westphalian
ham and black bread.
And when you arrive it won’t be
as a stranger; Lufthansa can tell
you what to see, where to buy.
Lufthansa is as ‘at home’ in the
bazaars of Bangkok as it is on a
Stuttgater Strasse.
Planning to go on from Tokyo to
Europe? Lufthansa gets you
there in just two hops. Tokyo
to Anchorage, then over the Pole
to Copenhagen and Frankfurt.
Does the enjoyment of your trip
have to end when the Games end?
Not while Lufthansa’s around.

at all wool auctions as well as appearing
in the Melbourne retail price of delivered
milk, numerous hourly wages’ awards,
car allowances, and a host of wholesale
prices. Seventy-five per cent of “deci-
mal” nations have minor units worth
one farthing or less; none has minor
units as large as our proposed cent
(1.2 d.). There are 960 farthings in £1
and by slightly devaluing the farthing so
that 1000 of them would equal £l, we
could have a decimal currency which
would be acceptable to everyone. Ten
farthings would equal “one cent” and
the cent, worth 2.4 d., could be the
smallest unit for banking purposes. Our
present coins would have the following
easily remembered decimal values: id.
2 farthings, Id. == 4 farthings, 3d. =
12 farthings, 6d. = 24 farthings, Is. =
5 cents, and 2s. = 10 cents or 1 florin.
With a little commonsense practical
planning, instead of the present theo-
retical nonsense, the whole of our retail
business community could simultane-
ously change to the pound-decimals,
thus eliminating the proposed costly two-
year dual currency period which Mr
Walter Scott and his Currency Board
deem essential if the $(10s.)-cent system
is to be adopted.

STUDENT “NIHILISM”
Sir,
Mr Vincent Buckley’s imputation of
nihilism to us students (8/8/64) is a
gratuitous piece of woolliness sympto-
matic of that ageing obscurantism that
wags its finger at the younger generation
in countless Sunday sermons. I would
suggest that part of our attitude which
he hurries to disapprove of is a most
heartfelt protest against the utter futility
of the world he represents. We are not
impressed by Mr Buckley’s style of life,
personally, or by that of the class of
individual to which he belongs. The
older generation, having clambered into
secure positions, can rarely resist its own
wisdom, but the results, to us, are appal-
ling.
Our “nihilism” is concerned, among
other things, with the exploration of a
world of personal relations based on utter
honesty.
Finally, we do not view Nazism as
easily as Mr Buckley does. It seems to us
that the official world of which he is
a part is generating such pressures below
the surface that a maniacal holocaust of
some kind is inevitable. The irony is that
the “nihilism” of my own generation
will be blamed for it.

Sir,
With great interest I, and two other

to Hayman Island over the last couple
of years. This article completely cap-
tured the two sides of a tropical island,!
and the ups and downs of wintering L
the Queensland sun. I must say thail
after the Beatles, strip-tease shows,'
Screaming Lord Sutch, etc., etc., it was!

PEACE CONGRESS
Sir,
As a sponsor and committee member'
of the Australian Congress for Inter-
national Co-operation and Disarmament,:
who is not one of the “old familiar
faces”, I must protest against your article,,
“Peace Battle Breaks Out Again”
(8/8/64). It comprises mainly smears,
innuendoes and inaccuracies.
You accuse, by implication, several
people —Mr Wheelwright, Mr Heffer-
nan, Mr Innis in particular because,
and apparently for no other reason, they!
are members of the ALP; I am not, inci-
dentally, a member of any political party, 1
You state that “Dr A. Lawes . . . has|
been active in other peace groups” asi
if this was a heinous crime. You state!
that many of the sponsors are having
second thoughts; 1 am one, and I know
of none who has withdrawn.
Without any specific evidence, you!
claim that the proposed congress appears
to be “completely” CP-manipulated. If
you had taken the trouble to read the
congress brochure, you would have seen
that the aims the sponsors undertake to
support are, first, the proposal that a
full and free public discussion should
take place in Australia on the issues of
international co-operation and disarma-
ment; second, the principle that such d 1
congress should be so organised as to
eliminate the possibility either of doming
tion or exclusion of minority viewpoints,
From my own experience as a sponsor
and committee member, I can confirm
that these principles have been observed,
With the Anglican bishops of Armi-
dale and Gippsland and hundreds of
other politically non-aligned people, I am
proud to be a sponsor of the congress.)
G. J. MORROW
Sydney (NSW).
Sir,
May I ask you to correct an error
which occurs in an article (8/8/64) on
the forthcoming Congress for Inter-
national Co-operation and Disarma-
ment? I am referred to as “Mrs M.
Holmes (Union of Australian Women)”.
Although I admire much of the work
done by the Union, and have occasion-
ally collaborated with them, I am not
and have never been a member nor do I
in any way represent them on the Con-
gress or any other committee.

National Notebook
greasepaint
We tried to puzzle out what there was
familiar about the very New York
type sitting opposite us. Jim Kenney,
who has taken over the lead in “How
to Succeed in Business Without Really
Trying”, supplied the answer in a clip-
ped American accent. “D’you remem-
ber,” he asked, “an old English music-
ball comedian with a sad, quavering
voice called Horace Kenney?” We
rubbed our bald patch and admitted we
did. “That,” said Kenney lapsing into
cockney, “was my old dad.”
Kenney junior made his debut in the
role of the second twin in “Peter Pan”.
“Like most theatrical families my parents
wanted me to concentrate on my educa-
tion,” he told us. “But I played truant
until they let me audition for the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Art. They re-
lented and I got my hearing. I gave
them Shakespeare and Shaw and the
RADA people agreed I had something.
But I was only 14 at the time —under
admittance age—so I went to the Conti
school.
“It was wonderful, but I don't think
I learned anything there. When this
jTeter Pan' part came along I grabbed it.
After three months’ studies I considered
myself launched. When ‘Peter Pan’
ended I went on tour with one of those
interminable English
farces in which everyone
is the duke of something
or other. Even I was an
‘Hon’. You never saw
«o many toupees in your
life. It looked as though
everyone was wearing fur
caps with partings down the middle.
“At that time my hero was Jack
Buchanan. I moulded every role on him
and used to circulate backstage, shooting
my cuffs and telling everybody in a
slightly throaty tone: ‘This isn’t really
my line’. God knows what they thought.
I was only 15. I suppose they thought
I was a little horror!”
Kenney's air of ingenuousness earned
him roles in such films as “Captain Horn-
blower”, “Tobruk” and stage produc-
tions usually dealing with junior crime
gangs. “I kept landing the same old
roles and decided I’d try the States.
“Of course my ancestors are probably
turning in their graves,” he said. “My
great-great-grandfather played with Sarah
Siddons before opening the Savoir Vive
Club for the regency bucks of the day.
He built Boodles Club in St James. Be-
fore going to the States I was guest of
honor there at a luncheon. The only
other guest was the then Prime Minister.
I left the speeches to Macmillan.
“Great - grandfather Charles Lamb
Kenney—Charles Lamb was his god-
father —was also associated with theatre.
He wrote plays and was critic for ‘The
Times’. My grandfather was a well-
known actor who never missed a cue.
But he couldn’t get through a perform-
ance without a drink. So he always in-
sisted that somewhere in the action a
drink was called for. One day the stage
manager sniffed the decanter they were
getting ready for the night’s perform-
ance. ‘My God,’ he cried, ‘this stuff’s
real!’ and he drained it and refilled it
with colored water.
“That night grandfather went on and
filled his glass from the decanter as
usual. But when he took a sip he spat
it out and roared ‘l’ve been poisoned!’
“Father was mild compared to them.
He had this little role of the sad clown
always trying to be cheerful in a most
depressing voice. He played Australia
on tour for JCW and raved about it.
He died seven years ago, but I think
he'd be happy to know I finally got here
—even with an American accent.”
The Patient in 506
We rang a friend in a big city private
hospital the other day—no answer
on his private line at all. What, we
wondered, had gone wrong? Blood
transfusion? Emergency
surgery? Finally the
switchboard operator put
us on to the floor sister.
“What’s happened to the
patient in Room 506?”
we asked apprehensively.
“506? Let me see,” she
answered, rifling through some papers
on her desk. “Ah, yes. 506 has gone
to the pictures.”
Big, Cruel World
“T used to get thousands of fan letters
from Australia when I was a kid,”
Bobby Breen said. Currently performing
at the Menzies, Sydney, he had, for a
brief span in the 19305, been one of
Hollywood’s top child stars, and his
“Rainbow on the River” had been a huge
success in Australia.
“I began singing in Canada at the
age of five,” he told us. “A bunch of
amateur shows, songs like ‘Stay as Sweet
as You Are’, hits of the period. My
sister saved up and we took the bus to
Chicago. She worked as a cigarette girl
to make ends meet. Milton Berle’s
mother auditioned me, and Milton hired
me as a foil for his show at the Oriental
Theatre. He always claims he discovered
me, you know.
“Out in Hollywood my sister went

hungry to keep me going. Producers
kept saying no. We were in despair—
about to give up when, while I was
watching a Tarzan picture being made,
I started singing to myself. The producer,
Sol Lesser, heard me, said, ‘C’mon, let’s
hear you sing,’ and auditioned me.
That’s how it began.
“My first picture for Lesser was ‘Let’s
Sing Again’, with Henry Armetta, Leo
Carrillo and the Australian comedian
Leon Erroll. It was tough out there. If
I got a fit of the giggles or didn’t
remember my lines the director would
shout—it often brought me to tears.
On my first picture we were working
overtime one night when I got terrible
pains in my stomach. The show had
to go on and I kept at it. ‘You can
make it’, they kept saying. Then I was
rushed to hospital. Appendicitis. I was
supposed to stay in hospital two weeks.
A week later they had me back at work.
“My ‘Rainbow on the River’ ran eight,
ten weeks at Radio City Music Hall—
a record for those days. ‘Hawaii Calls’
was a big hit, too. Then it was all over.
In 1940 I retired, aged 12. You know,
I’m not a psychiatrist, but child stars
have it especially bad when they grow
up. Some of the ones I knew at the time
committed suicide, took drugs . . . you
see, people who knew you then
suddenly don’t know you any more. A
child feels those things more than an
adult. You’re out alone in the so-called
big, cruel world . . . but I’ve been lucky.
I’ve got my own recording company,
I’ve started cutting records again, and
there’s nightclub work . . .” And Bobby
Breen, aged 36, strolled off to a cocktail
bar to face* the Big, Cruel World.
Is Footy Fading?
Aur man in Melbourne reports:
One of the most atrocious weather
afternoons for the year had 70,385 spec-
tators for the Melbourne-Essendon match
at the MCG.
Also we have just witnessed the crazy
situation where Australian Rules enthu-
siasts waited outside the MCG for four
days for their grand final tickets.
All this has made us utterly fascinated
by a report of a lecture by Dr Bruce
Kent, a lecturer in history at the Nation-
al University. He said that the numbers
of people attending League matches was
steadily decreasing. For most of the
century the attendance at League games
averaged 10 per cent of the population
on any one Saturday. In 1914 it was
50,000 to 60,000 out of a population of
600,000. Twenty years later it was
100,000 out of one million. Now,
1964, the average attendance was
140,000, only between 6 and 7 per cent
of Melbourne’s population.
So, you see, we are slipping and really
not all that football crazy. If only we
were as keen as our parents we would
get a decent 200,000 every Saturday.

PLAIN ENGLISH
Defence and Inflation
in the Budget
[n what had been expected to be
largely an exercise in finding
more money for defence in a
fairly tight resources situation, the
Budget turned out to be mainly
directed to containing inflation with-
in the context of a massive all-
round increase in Government ex-
penditure, only a little more than a
sixth of which is for direct spend-
ing on defence. (See “National
Service?”, page 35.) In that sense
the Budget was an anti-climax
which came strangely in the light
of the delicate situation in South
East Asia; and it could prove to be
an opportunity lost. Of course, it
will not be read in that way by
those construing defence expendi-
ture in the wider sense as anything
spent on building up the strength of
the economy.
In that sense a pound spent
directly on the defence services is
taken to have equal weight with
money invested in development, in-
cluding social investment in educa-
tion, and even in foreign aid. Of
the mammoth overall increase of
£224 million in expenditure, in-
direct defence activities account for
£91.7 million compared with only
£36.3 million extra to be spent
directlv on the defence services
themselves.-
direct and indirect
A spending on defence thus
accounts for roughly 57 per cent
of the total increase.
But, in these critical days can we
afford the luxury of sitting back on
this comfortable, Jesuitical view
of defence requirements? It would
seem to be more realistic to take
direct expenditure on defence as
the true criterion. Yet, even with
this year’s increase, this is only
about 12 per cent of the Federal
Budget and is still a long way
below the efforts of most of our
allies.
If the Government is trying to
achieve a more appropriate and
realistic balance between direct and
indirect defence expenditure it is
certainly not evident in this Budget.
It is the heavier concentration on
indirect defence requirements which
has, in fact, dominated the Budget
and pressed the Treasurer very hard
to find additional finance to pay the
bills in this direction; so hard, in-
deed, that with all the increases in
taxation and charges he has still
only managed to avoid budgeting
for a deficit by the (for these days)
narrow margin of £lBl million.
It is obvious that if it becomes
necessary to step up direct spend-
ing on defence in the course of the
year the Budget will come out in
the red. Having left itself with such
a small margin between dampener
and stimulus, the Government may
live to regret that it chose to press
on so vigorously on the spending
front. This is partly because the
private sector is doing the same but
the Treasurer should have made
more room for it. There is also a
distinct possibility that his proposals
for raising more revenue will ex-
acerbate the cost-push inflation
which has been gathering momen-
tum because of rising wages.
He was warned about this by
business leaders in their pre-Budget
consultations with him in Canberra,
but apparently he took little notice.
This lack of judgment applies parti-
cularly in respect of the increase in
company tax and telephone charges.
It is understandable, of course, that
being out after a lot more revenue,
and intent on showing a surplus
despite greatly expanded expendi-
ture, the Treasurer was anxious to
spread the burden as fairly as pos-
sible over the various sections of
the community.
Tt would have been most im-
A politic to have excused Aus-
tralian companies from their share
of the tax burden. Nonetheless the
Treasurer seems to be after too big
a slice of company income this
year, £346 million or an increase
of £52.8 million of which about
three-fifths will come from the
natural rise in revenue at the old
tax rates and the other two-fifths
from imposing an additional 6d. on
company tax in the Budget. While
this extra slug will probably have
the desirable effect at this stage of
dampening company investment to
some extent, it should also, over a
wide range of companies, force
price increases to maintain profit
margins.
Cost-push inflation could well be
the most worrying force in the eco-
nomy this year and it is the more
the pity that the additional revenue
gained from abolishing the 5 per
cent tax rebate will practically all be
spent by the Government. This
exercise seemed pointless as it has
absolutely none of the anti-inflation-
ary virtues of a mopping-up opera-
tion. It is merely robbing Peter to
pay Paul.
Clearly the Budget does not set
out to prevent the dangers of in-
creasing inflationary pressures in
the economy. Rather it seems to
throw the whole weight of that task
on to the shoulders of monetary
policy. From his latest actions Dr
Coombs seems to be fully aware
of the needs in that direction and it
is unfortunate that the Budget has
given him no help at all.


THIS AUSTRALIA
FOREIGN POLICY
How to Put Out
a Bushfire
Fishing for votes in the Gulf of Tonkin
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
GOUGH WHITLAM
Clear-cut issue
last week's indications, defence and
foreign policy will dominate the
Senate elections which must be held be-
fore June 30 next year and which will
probably be held in November of this
year. If they remain the sole major
issues it will be the first time in Aus-
tralia's peacetime history that an election
will be decided on events occurring far
from Australia's shores. Labor starts in
poor shape with its Parliamentary ranks
obviously split. It is not by accident
that last week’s foreign policy debate
was dominated largely by Labor’s Left-
wingers. Quite a number of Right-
wingers stayed out of the debate from
choice and not because of the pressure
of time (Labor Whip Gil Duthie, the
Opposition’s last speaker in the debate,
revealed that he was speaking only
because nobody else had desired to put
his name down for the 12th speaking
Pl ace )-
Menzies' crack that there were “deep
divisions between the more sober Right-
wing members of the Labor Party who
agree with what I have said (that the
reaction of the United States under
attack in the Gulf of Tonkin in inter-
national waters was well warranted and
should be supported), and the Left-wing
of the Labor Party which in its heart is
not hostile to Communism and is deeply
hostile to the United States” was de-
signed to advance his political cause,
But it was also justified by the general
trend of the debate,
Labor reaction to External Affairs
Minister Paul Hasluck's homely illustra-
tion that you must try to put out a bush-
fire before you can resume farming
showed how split the ALP is on foreign
policy.
The brief, precise speech of Deputy
Opposition Leader Mr Gough Whitlam,
when reduced to its basics, was an ac-
ceptance of that viewpoint, and will earn
him the hostility of the Labor Left-wing.
“Military action in Vietnam is essential,"
he said, “if the position is to be secured
until political and social progress can
be made. None of us desires to aban-
don military action in Borneo.”
In reply, Left-wing Labor members
argued that there was no bushfire in
South Vietnam —that the smoke Hasluck
saw was merely internal burning off,
After Navy Minister Fred Chaney—a
recent visitor to South-East Asia —had
described how he had seen the most
modern automatic weapons, made in
Czechoslovakia and China, taken from
anti-South Vietnam forces and Hasluck
had corrected a Left-wing claim that
United States authorities said there had
been no interference in South Vietnam
by North Vietnam Communist forces,
Mr Tom Uren (Lab. NSW) persuaded
the Opposition Leader Mr Calwell to
buy back into the debate in support of
the Left-wing viewpoint. Mr Uren car-
ried to Mr Calwell on the front Labor
bench a copy of the American magazine,
“Time”, and Mr Calwell dutifully rose
to his feet to tell the House that “Time"
had reported that North Vietnam was
infiltrating South Vietnam only with men
who had been born in South Vietnam.
Mr Whitlam said that if political and
social advances were not made military
action in the area would be fruitless. He
was also firm about the right of the
United States to retaliate over the Ton-
kin Gulf incident. For once, he said,
there is a clear-cut issue on which there
could be no argument.
Sir Robert Menzies pointed out that
Dr Cairns, (whom he described as at
least being the Labor Party's proposed
Deputy Leader, an obvious tilt at the
protective interest Mr Calwell is taking
in Dr Cairns) had been reported as say-
ing that Australia should not follow the
American line which, said Sir Robert,
Dr Cairns defined as pursuing a policy
of war which had no basis in morals or
justice. Dr Cairns later said that the
remarks he made in the address to which
Sir Robert had referred were directed
to the general war situation in the area
and not to the Tonkin Gulf incident.
This later led Labor Minister William
McMahon to point out the basic clash
between the views of Mr Whitlam, the
Labor heir-apparent, and Dr Cairns,
and to the fact that Dr Cairns is now
a real threat to Mr Whitlam’s prospects
of succession to Labor leadership. It
was an interesting debate which finished
as far as Parliament was concerned in
the early hours of Friday morning last
but which will undoubtedly be carried to
the hustings in the coming Senate
elections.
ARROGANCE
Saturday, August 23, 1884
Australians to pretend to sway
A the councils of the Empire, by
insisting upon the acquisitive instincts
of a Jingo section being deferred to,
is too arrogant. Besides being arro-
gant, it is, according to our view,
stupid and narrow. It is certain that
Australia would, at her present stage
of development, be weaker, not
stronger, were the colonies, even in
Federal unity, to take possession of
New Guinea. It is not clear, indeed,
that the Imperial Power itself would
be enhanced in these regions, even
were the annexation to be made by the
mother country.
The acquisition would lead, in case
of war the one case in view of
which annexation is mainly advocated
—to a dissipation of national
strength. It would increase the assail-
able points; and it might very well
happen that the squadron, which,
under present circumstances, would
be stationed so as to assist in pro-
tecting the capitals of Australia,
would, under the changed circum-
stances, be drawn off to cover the in-
fant weakness of newer settlements
on the New Guinea coast,
We regard with contempt such im-
pertinences as the claims daily ventila-
ted in the Philistine papers, of prior-
ity of right to such places as the New
Hebrides, New Britain, New Ireland,
the Solomons, and so forth.


EDUCATION
Taking Christ Out
of Christianity
iir The desirability of the good life 99
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
Mr E. WETHERELL
Full responsibility
fTHE new NSW primary schools’ sylla-
bus for religious teaching is both
the apologia of the Minister for Educa-
tion, Mr Wetherell, and his final word.
Mr Wetherell, who is 71, has announced
that he will not contest his seat of Cobar
at the State elections next year. He has
also said that he would not claim to
have written the new syllabus but that he
“takes full responsibility for every word
of it”. The syllabus, called “General
Religious Teaching”, replaces the Scrip-
ture Syllabus, introduced in 1959 by
the previous Minister for Education,
Mr R. J. Heffron.
The new syllabus has been strongly
criticised by Protestant clergymen, but
has been spoken of by teachers, Jews,
Catholics and humanists with varying
degrees of warmth. The Anglican Arch-
bishop of Sydney, Dr H. R. Gough, has
asked the Premier, Mr Renshaw, to meet
a deputation of Anglican and Protestant
representatives.
The syllabus almost entirely takes
Christ out of Christianity. It says that
“general religious teaching is concerned
with the desirability of the good life for
personal growth but not as a means for
the advancement of the individual in
competition with his fellows”. It does
not mention God, but says that although
“material selected from religious sources
must be carefully chosen”, the Bible is
a “rich source of teaching material and
much of what has been prescribed for
use by teachers in the past will have a
place in the new syllabus and demon-
strate the fundamental beliefs of the
Christian religion”.
The syllabus says that since World
War II a “great shrinkage has occurred in
the separations between classes, nations
and cultures, and, more recently, be-
tween religions, and great effort has been
put into the seeking and cultivation of
the things that join human societies to-
gether”. “A new outlook has developed
and the world’s religious leaders have
been among the most active in promoting
this new outlook,” the booklet says.
“Teachers are urged,” the syllabus
says, “to seek suitable additional material
in writings of other religions. The
respect for life in all its forms that is
so strongly stressed in Buddhism is an
example.
“The story of Christmas and/or that
of Easter unfold basic Christian beliefs,
but they may be put so that no objection
from any other religion would be ten-
able.
“Not all lessons, however, will be
based on religious teachings or narra-
tive. They will often rely for illustra-
tion on secular literature or happenings
in daily life as reported, for example,
in the Press or seen on television. There
is something to be learned from the
Negro child facing the hostility of a
white school in the process of desegrega-
tion, from a motherless girl caring for
her younger brothers and sisters, from
the battle of an old woman against
poverty and hopelessness and other such
occurrences as may be news items in the
daily Press.”
The syllabus quotes Clause 7 of the
1880 Public Instruction Act, which says,
“In all schools under this Act the teach-
ing shall be strictly non-sectarian but the
words ‘secular instruction’ shall be held
to include general religious teaching as
distinct from dogmatical and polemical
theology.”
The chairman of the NSW Council for
Christian Education in School, Rev. Mr
A. A. Langdon, said the syllabus was
“biased against Christianity”. “To
change the concept of general religious
instruction without a mandate from the
people when it has been in force for
more than 100 years violates the demo-
cratic principle,” he said.
The director of the Catholic Informa-
tion Bureau, Dr W. E. Murray, said it
would be hard to condemn the syllabus
as part of a system of secular educa-
tion. “It appears to me the logical ex-
pression of the attitude of that system to-
wards religion,” he said. He added that
Catholic children would be advised not
to attend classes teaching the new
syllabus.
The president of the NSW Humanist
Society, Dr J. H. Hirshman, called the
syllabus “a giant stride in the right
direction”.
THE LAND—I
Tobacco’s Problem:
Over-Production
The hopes of share-farmers go up in smoke
FROM DAVID MCDOUGALL IN MELBOURNE
JFhe small flame of trouble in Austra-
lia’s tobacco - growing industry,
sparked when 400 Italian share-farmers
rioted at sales down here after a large
portion of their crop went unsold, has
now spread into a real bonfire. And
this is desirable. Despite the newsworthy
abuse which the now poverty-stricken
Italians threw at the buyers for favoring
leaf mainly from the bigger “capitalist”
concerns, and despite the volley of jus-
tification the buyers presented for their
actions, the central problem can now be
got at. This over-production was
pointed out in The Bulletin last week,
and its importance borne out by subse-
quent events.
Once a “scandal” such as this gets
beyond the headlines, and the appropri-
ate people start to do something about it,
then it is well on the way to being
abolished. After the riot, the Victorian
Cabinet met to study reports from the
police and the Department of Agricul-
ture. As a result, an investigation has
been ordered, concentrating mainly on
the financial position of the growers.
The Italians are in dire straights. On
the average, each man sold only about
half his crop and even then at lower
prices than they were expecting. At
the time of going to press, the rest can
only be sold for Is. 6d. a pound to
Chinese and Japanese concerns —produc-
tion costs are around 7s. 6d. a pound.
Although it can’t do much at present,
their only real hope for the future is the
Commonwealth Government's stabilisa-
tion scheme. In Canberra last week,
95 p.c. agreement was reached between
three Federal Ministers, State Govern-
men officials and representatives of
the growers and manufacturers. Al-
though the plans are not known, the
basis of them all must be the limitation
of production. In return it has been
suggested that the growers may ask for
concessions from the manufacturers and
more tariff protection.

Should Merino Rams
be Exported?
An unequivocal “Yes” from a scientist
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
Sir WILLIAM GUNN
Confident
Recent discussions on the Wool
Board's reserve price scheme seem
to have left the impression that selling
methods are the only open question
facing the industry. But the wool in-
dustry, in common with most primary
industries, finds few final answers to its
problems. One question still unresolved
is whether the embargo on the export of
merino rams should be lifted, and what
effect this lifting would have on the
Australian wool industry.
The answers to the first question in-
clude the hopeful “yes” from the stud-
breeders, whose interests are most closely
involved, and the confident “yes’ of the
chairman of the Australian Wool Board,
Sir William Gunn. Sir William's view
essentially is that if the ban were lifted
the improvement in flocks in other coun-
tries would lead to increased world de-
mand for wool. This increased demand
would not only cause no lessening in
demand for Australian wool, but the
added emphasis on wool as a textile
would indirectly help Australia.
The complete answer to the second
question, what effect would the lifting
of the ban have on the industry, can
come only from an economist. How-
ever, technical aspects are important.
One scientist, Dr Euan Roberts, senior
lecturer at the School of Wool Techno-
logy, University of NSW, told The
Bulletin that his belief was that if the
ban were lifted it would have “practi-
cally no effect” on the Australian wool
industry and on overseas flocks.
Dr Roberts believes that Australian
blood would be a “novelty” to foreign
breeders for a short time, but that per-
manent improvement in flocks would
not result. He thought that in a country
such as South Africa there might be
some slight commercial advantage in
being able to advertise Australian rams,
to use the label “imported” in advertise-
ments in stud journals.
However, South Africa, which might
be the country most likely to want Aus-
tralian rams, would be the least likely
to benefit from them, simply because
South African flocks were already of a
high standard. “It would simply be
pouring more water into an already full
cup,” Dr Roberts said.
He believes that the pre-eminence of
Australian fine wools rests on environ-
mental factors—selective grazing, pos-
sibly mineral elements in the soil, low
humidity. To these must be added good
type sheep, of course, but the environ-
mental factors, Dr Roberts believes, tip
the scales and make it extremely doubt-
ful whether any other country could take
Australia’s place as a producer of fine
wools.
Dr Roberts said he felt that the
countries which would benefit most from
Australian rams would be those which
were seeking to improve their merino
stock on a quantitative rather than a
qualitative basis. But any country which
wanted to increase the number of its
merino flocks could already get per-
fectly adequate stock from the Soviet
or South Africa for the purpose, without
coming near Australia. Dr Roberts said
that Russia had supplied merino sheep
to Bulgaria and China.
Dr Roberts, who was one of a dele-
gation of Australian wool experts who
visited the Soviet in 1960, said that the
present estimate of Russia’s merino sheep
was between 58 and 60 million. He felt
that Russian fine wool production was
regulated by home demand, and there
was little likelihood of Russia becoming
an exporter of fine wool. The necessity
for winter housing and hand-feeding was
a cost factor in the Soviet.

A Shock for
Housewives
A tell-tale kidney
FROM A PERTH CORRESPONDENT
A rift within Western Australia’s meat
industry is stretching the bonds of
friendship between Commonwealth and
State departments, as well as within the
already-troubled Liberal-Country Party
coalition. The differences came to light
when West Australian housewives were
told they were buying meat that would
not be considered fit for the Singapore
market.
Only about a dozen of the State’s
170 abattoirs matched up to. the health
requirements for export outlets. Until
last week this situation was compounded
by two sets of inspection regulations.
Inspectors from WA’s Public Health De-
partment worked within the bounds of
the 50-year-old State Health Act; De-
partment of Primary Industry veterinari-
ans had to live up to a different set of
rules.
At Midland Junction, one of the
metropolitan area’s biggest abattoirs,
this divided rule backfired in the last
week before “dual inspection” was in-
troduced. A Commonwealth veterinarian,
not liking the look of one carcase of
beef, ordered a kidney tested by the
State Department of Agriculture. The
company sold the beast, anyway, after it
had been cleared for the local market by
the Public Health Department . . . and a
few days later the analysis returned,
showing that the beast had had TB.
Under the newly-introduced system, it
would not be possible for one inspector
to cut across another in this way. But
dual inspection operates at only about
15 per cent of the abattoirs in the State.
LAW
The Value
of Experts
" The Gash Lash" ruled obscene
From a Sydney Correspondent
The evidence of philosophers, artists
and authors for the defence in the
“Tharunka” magazine “The Gas Lash”
case was discounted by Mr E. J. Gib-
son, SM, when he gave his verdict in
Sydney Central Court last week.
Mr Gibson said it was apparent that
their opinions on “The Gas Lash” were
arrived at after critical examination.


However, in considering the opinion of
these witnesses it must be remembered
that they were not in the class of persons
or age groups among whom the article
was intended to be distributed.
Before the court were Michael Wil-
liam Robertson, of Epping; Alexander
Popov, of Warrawee; Russell Peter Mor-
gan Conyngham, of Campsie; and Mar-
tin Ritchie Sharp, of Bellevue Hill, all
students; and Alfred Francis James,
printer of Chippendale. Mr Gibson fined
Sharp and James £lO each and the
others £5. All gave notice of appeal.
“The Gas Lash”, which appeared in
“Tharunka”, the NSW University stu-
dents’ paper, on February 17, and which
was written and drawn by Sharp is a
young man’s first-person story of an un-
successful seduction attempt.
Mr Gibson said the Obscene and In-
decent Publications Act applied to undue
emphasis of sex, crimes of violence,
gross cruelty or horror. In his view,
“The Gas Lash” unduly emphasised sex
and was obscene.
Mr Gibson said that “Tharunka” was
for distribution to students during Orien-
tation Week, but the inference was that
not all copies would remain at the uni-
versity and, as evidence showed, some
went far beyond.
IMMIGRATION
The Santonastaso Saga
Who will spare a thought for Alfred, aged 7?
FROM JOHN WEBB IN CANBERRA
MR JUSTICE DOVEY
Recommended deportation
Tmmigration Minister .Hubert Opper-
man is reconsidering his refusal to
grant a visa to Pasquale Santonastaso fol-
lowing headline treatment of the case in
the Italian Press and fresh representa-
tions on Santonastaso’s behalf.
The published Italian version of the
affair seems to have labelled Hubert
Opperman a vicious creature for his re-
fusal to allow a father to return to Aus-
tralia to see his seven-year-old son. But
the facts tend to support the Minister’s
caution.
Santonastaso, son of an Italian judge,
settled in Australia and married Mary
Celestine Walsh in Sydney in March,
1956. Alfred was born a year later.
Pasquale Santonastaso gave an under-
taking when court proceedings were
adjourned late in 1958 that he would not
interfere with the existing position: the
child was in his mother’s custody and his
father had restricted access to him. It
was then that Santonastaso “spirited
away” his son to New Zealand and
caught a ship to Italy.
His wife remained in Australia long
enough to be awarded custody of the
child by the Children’s Court and then
went to Italy herself. In Italy the
couple were legally separated but this
time it was the mother who took the
child away—to London where it was the
turn of Santonastaso to secure a court
order to stop his wife taking the child.
Mrs Santonastaso, an Australian citi-
zen, brought her Australian-born son
back to Australia in spite of that court
order —a flight which the Italian Press
has claimed was “facilitated” by Austra-
lian authorities, although how they could
have forbidden her return to her native
country is not explained.
Faced with this development Santo-
nastaso successfully applied for a visa to
return to Australia. In October, 1962,
a Supreme Court order was made which
restrained him from going within half
a mile of the child's home. Six months
later Santonastaso was sentenced to six
months’ gaol for gross contempt of court.
Mr Justice Dovey said he would re-
commend to the Minister for Immigra-
tion that Santonastaso be deported.
Santonastaso’s second departure from
Australia in May, 1963, amounted to
voluntary deportation. The Court agreed
to his release from prison providing he
left Australia.
It was against this background
and with the knowledge that Santonas-
taso tried during one of his regular
access periods to take away the boy (he
was caught on that occasion in Ade-
laide) that Mr Opperman considered an
application for Santonastaso to return
to Australia last November. Mr Opper-
man turned down that application.
The Minister’s position now is not an
easy one. There has been pressure from
official Italian sources for a reversal of
the decision. Santonastaso is asking to
come to Australia for a third time.
Whatever the outcome of the present
review it must be hoped, for Alfred’s
sake, that the wrangling will soon be
settled.
THE GAMES
Headaches for
the Council
If Madigan beats Casey ...
FROM “DISCUS” IN SYDNEY
August 21 in Brisbane, and a week
later in Sydney, Tony Madigan will
box Fred Casey, ostensibly to give him
valuable practice for the Olympic
Games. But if Tony -happens to win
both matches clearly, then Murray Rose
will have a partner in his attempt to
represent Australia, and the Olympic
Council will have one more headache.
In all of the arguments for and
against the inclusion of Prince, Rose and
Madigan, I haven't seen any convincing
explanation of the reason for the early,
final and inflexible choice of our Olym-
pic squad. Most nations are still in the
course of choosing theirs, and I wonder
what will happen if, for instance, Bruce
Tulloh suddenly regains form after
someone else has been chosen to run
for Britain in the 5000 metres?
To be fair, other countries’ repre-
sentatives are in condition or, in Tul-
loh’s case, exhaustion—at the end of
their summer, while ours need time to
find condition. But with our cast of
hundreds, already chosen, why does the
selection have to be so final at this point
that there can be no substitutions?
There are precedents. Russell Mock-
ridge was an Olympic team member at
the last moment, although he did not
compete in the Australian trials. He was
abroad, gaining experience against the
world's best. So it can be asked whether
Rose, striking form in swims against
Schollander and Saari, was not acting
more sensibly than John Konrads, who
obediently returned home to swim
against time and has, so far, failed to
regain form, but who is in the team?
If Madigan convincingly defeats
Casey, his claims will be difficult to re-
ject. He was recovering from ’flu when
Casey beat him in the official trials. But
the bureaucratic machinery of Olympic
selection makes no provision for an
athlete of his proven class to have his
trial postponed. Or for a swimmer of
Rose’s greatness to be included in the
Australian team, surely automatically,
when he breaks a world record.
Rose could be swimming at Ayr now.
In the distance events, particularly, who
will swim in which event is quite unde-
cided. It could not possibly do any
harm to add Rose to the Windle, Phelps,
Konrads contest and let the best man
swim for Australia in the 1500 metres.


OVERSEAS
The War in Cyprus - 1
Premeditated murder and business as usual
From KENNETH MACKENZIE in Nicosia
Last week’s events have been a trau-
matic experience for all Greek
Cypriots and, whatever emerges
from the immediate crisis, the island will
never be quite the same again. The sweep
of Turkish jets and the trail of devasta-
tion have jerked the Cyprus question out
of the 19th century into the 20th. For too
long the Cypriots’ struggle for self-deter-
mination had been portrayed in romantic
terms of a Greek war of independence,
as a fight for freedom by patriotic cadres
set in the mould of Achilles against
satanic forces of tyranny and oppression
but a struggle in which, despite all the
flamboyant talk of heroism, not many
people would run the risk of being
killed and business would keep ticking
over nicely.
The Turkish raids have changed all
that, and many Cypriots are for the first
time beginning to see the issue in a
more realistic context. Yet it would be
wrong to depict the Cypriots as being in
a state of panic. On Saturday, August
8, the chief emotion was fear, and many
Greek Cypriots were in a mood to com-
promise simply to avert destruction; on
the Sunday night this had changed to
hatred and a determination to *fight to
the last. If the Turks had contented
themselves with a series of reconnais-
sance swoops over Nicosia and other
towns without firing a shot they would
have held the whole situation.
What has dismayed the Greeks almost
as much as the bombing is the discovery
that in their hours of crisis their new-
found friends Egypt, Syria and the
Soviet bloc—supported them only with
words. Nothing has revealed the extra-
ordinary insularity of the Greek Cypriots
more than the fixed belief that, if ever
they were attacked, the Russians and
Arabs would rush in to repel the Turks.
The possibility of open and official
support from these countries cannot yet
be dismissed, but it has been apparent
that in the first days of the crisis no one
was prepared to rally to the Greek
Cypriot side, however much the Turkish
raids were deplored.
To some extent this has checked the
wave of pro-Russian feeling that has
almost engulfed the island in recent
months. Indeed, there has been dis-
sension within the Government on how
far Cyprus should go in imploring Soviet
aid. The Right-wing elements were
almost openly saying “we told you so”
when Russian planes failed to appear.
This does not mean, however, that
there is any lessening of bitterness against
the West. Feeling towards the “Anglo-
Americans” is at fever pitch, with the
US taking the brunt.
The explanation is simple. On August
7, a few hours before the Turkish air
attacks, a small item was slipped into
the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation
news bulletin saying the US Govern-
ment had supplied Turkey with 24 jet
aircraft to strengthen NATO defences
in the Eastern Mediterranean. The
bulletin did not mention that Greece had
also received similar jet reinforcements
and that the whole transaction had taken
place some time previously. There is
now hardly a Greek Cypriot who does
not believe that the Turkish attack was
deliberately engineered by the Ameri-
cans. This allegation is repeated daily
by the-local Press.
But perhaps the bitterest pill has been
the reluctance of Mother Greece to
come to the rescue. After weeks of
denials, the conflict between Athens and
Nicosia has been nakedly revealed. At
the very moment when Archbishop
Makarios and his ministers were expect-
ing Greek planes they received an
acidulous telegram from Prime Minister
Papandreou virtually blaming them for
starting the trouble.
The breach was hastily patched up in
subsequent talks in Athens, and Mr
Papandreou has pledged that Greece
will stand by Cyprus in the event of
further Turkish aggression. But for the
moment their attitude could swiftly
change the Cypriots are bitterly dis-
appointed with the Athens Government,
and this may well express itself again in
favor of independence, against Enosis
(union with Greece) as a permanent
solution. Undoubtedly the key to the
whole situation in the next few weeks
is the relationship between Mr Papan-
dreou and Makarios. For months now
the Cyprus tail has been wagging the
Hellenic dog, and if this relationship
continues it will be impossible to secure
a solution through top-level diplomatic
talks.
talk about putting Makarios in
quarantine and fixing a solution in
Geneva seems completely unreal to most
observers in Nicosia; no such solution
will be accepted by Makarios unless it
fully meets his demands. As head of a
sovereign State he can always take the
matter to the UN, where he is confident
the verdict will go in his favor. Mean-
while, another flare-up could provoke
more Turkish air attacks —and finally
war.
What can be safely predicted is that
the whole island will be a tinder-box for
the next few weeks unless a miracle
brings all parties to their senses. The
Turkish raids have left the Greeks seeth-
ing for revenge, and it could come in
many forms. Economic blockade of the

Turkish quarters is tightening; everyone
expects the Greeks to cut off supplies to
the Turkish troops still stationed a few
miles out of Nicosia. At Ktima water
supplies have been cut off, allegedly be-
cause the Turks have not paid local
water dues. It only needs a spark to set
fighting off at any moment in Nicosia’s
old-walled city or in the area around
Kyrenia, which is still held by the Turks.
One danger is that the Turks might
provoke a clash, hoping this would in’
turn provoke another Turkish bombing
attack.
As the Cyprus High Commissioner in
London has revealed in a recent state-
ment, the possibility of starting a third
World War is viewed with equanimity
by Cypriots of either community. The
island is in a sense sick with an evil
narcissism, and in its present mood

The War in Cyprus-2
Teaching the bearded prelate a lesson
From a Special Correspondent in Ankara
Whatever effect the Turkish bomb-
ing of Cyprus had abroad, it
caused unqualified delight and
relief inside Turkey. Almost every Turk
one talks to, almost every editorial in
the Turkish Press, sum up their sensa-
tions of joy and contentment with the
two deep-felt words: “At last.”
The view of all Turks is that Mr
Inonu’s government had exercised a far
too long drawn-out and absolutely in-
comprehensible patience for eight months
under continuous Greek-Cypriot provo-
cations, and the pressure inside Turkey
to take some kind of violent action and
“teach the bearded prelate a lesson” had
become almost irresistible.
Archbishop Makarios appears to have
failed to realise the strength of feeling
inside Turkey, and gave the Turks
exactly the chance they needed by at-
tacking the Greek-Cypriot positions in
the north-west of the island. The Turk-
ish Government, taking its cue from the
American bombing of shore bases in
North Vietnam, struck boldly and, in
the event, got away with it.
It was an admirable moment, boldly
seized. As many people felt and said:
“If the Americans can do it, why should
not the Turks, who have suffered worse
provocations than the Americans, and
for months on end?” Turks in general
think of the Greeks and Greek-Cypriots
as an infuriating people who, for some
incomprehensible reason, are the spoilt
darlings of the West, and the Turks
always tend to suspect that Western
governments are likely to favor the
Greek cause against Turkey on Cyprus.
The recent proposals by Mr Dean
Acheson for Enosis on certain conditions
made them more than ever certain of
this.
The result of the whole affair so far
is therefore exactly what Prime Minister
Inonu wanted; for the first time during
the whole crisis he has the unqualified
support of all Turkish political parties
for his government, and the delight and
relief of the people, even of those who
are usually his most bitter opponents.
Today even the soberest of Turkish news-
papers are banner-headlining phrases
such as “We have brought Makarios to
his knees”, and “The bearded prelate
bows to Turkey’s will”.
There is joy, too, that the Greek
Government’s “bluff” has now been
called, in the sense that the Greek Pre-
mier, Mr Papandreou, had declared
majestically that an attack on Cyprus
would be regarded as an attack on
Greece —but when it came to the point
Greece did nothing to implement this
pledge. Thus Turkey has got away with
a major military blow against Makarios,
almost as satisfactory as a real invasion
of the island.
American Government, apparently
A unwilling to be accused once
again by the Turks of preventing them
from invading Cyprus, this time seems to
have done little to discourage Turkish
air raids. The Turks seem to have been
in close consultation with America
during the past few days, perhaps cal-
culating shrewdly that the Americans,
after Vietnam, were hardly in a position
to blame Turkey for doing the same
as they have done.
The Turks were clearly afraid of
Soviet intervention, and last weekend
heavy Turkish reinforcements were sent
up to the Turkish-Soviet frontier. Here,
again, the Turks got away with it when
Mr Khrushchev’s message to Mr Inonu
after the bombing was couched in mild
and general terms.
This week there have been smiles on
all Turkish faces. You might think it
was a national holiday. Officials at the
Ankara post office who took this cable
beaming broadly, said, “The priest has
got his punishment,” Said the taxi-
driver, who took me there, “It’s time
the Greeks got what they deserve.”

Gentlemen, be seated comfortably
Some men sit and think. Others just sit and sometimes
curse the chairs they’re sitting on! Like lots of things, chairs
have to be judged in relation to their purpose. A good chair
for snoozing in the club is a bad chair for a busy bar. Fitness
for purpose is the main consideration when we are
recommending seating plans for busy places. Write

The Man
Behind
Viet Cong
Giap: 'A snow-covered volcano '
From DENNIS BLOODWORTH
in Singapore
/"|ne sad, private memory may have
punctuated the sharp reactions of
General Vo Nguyen Giap’s military
mind when he heard in Hanoi that car-
rier-based American aircraft had last
week bombed the oil storage depot at
Vinh in North Vietnam. The quiet
estuary town has unhappy memories for
the Commander-in-Chief and Defence
Minister of the Communist “Democratic
Republic of Vietnam”. The French
arrested his wife there on charges of
Communist conspiracy in 1939, and he
never saw her again. She died of ill-
ness and neglect in prison in 1943.
Close comrades have said that this
loss gave the embittered, ruthless and
dedicated side of the General’s nature
ascendancy over his earlier warm-
hearted emotionalism.
The nature of this man is important.
Today he is behind the strategy of
nearly 30,000 Viet Cong guerrillas fight-
ing against South Vietnam and its Ameri-
can military supporters. But if President
Johnson’s “limited and fitting” reprisal
for North Vietnamese torpedo-boat
attacks against US destroyers should
lead to war, General Giap would be-
come the Pentagon’s immediate adver-
sary.
He has been described as a “snow-
covered volcano”, an officer whose cold
outward manner conceals a burning
hatred for his enemies. He may have
seemed like that to the French in the
past. He was not at all like that when
I saw him after the end of the Indo-
China war in 1954. Short and stocky,
usually dressed in a plain brown high-
buttoned uniform without insignia of
rank, he was relaxed, smiling and
friendly.
But Giap, now 52 years old, should
not be misunderstood. The son of a
poor scholar from the province of
Quang Binh, he joined the “Revolution-
ary Party of New Annam” in French
colonial Indo-China when barely 15
and was imprisoned before he was 20
for student agitation in the old imperial
capital of Hue. In 1933, he joined the
Indo-Chinese Communist Party and by
1936 had become a leader of its legal
cover organisation, the “Democratic
Front”.
Giap worked as a history teacher and
studied law, but in 1939 he was driven
underground. He reappeared two years
later in South China where he attended
a conference at which the “Vietminh”
movement was formed and he first met
Ho Chi Minh. Given the task of organ-
ising a Communist guerrilla force in
North Vietnam, Giap became one of
those Asian Communist insurgents who
trained and equipped their forces for the
coming struggle against the Western
colonial powers by acting as anti-Japan-
ese “resistance” leaders during World
War 11, so qualifying for the Allied arms
that were parachuted to them in occu-
pied territory.
In those days he earned a reputation
for the brutal suppression of pro-French
“collaborators”, but he was also effici-
ently forging the weapon that was later
to defeat a vast French military ap-
paratus heavily supported by US aid in
the eight-year Indo-China war.
/General Giap, who is also a Deputy
Premier of North Vietnam and a
member of the Lao Dong (Communist)
Party’s Politburo, is, nevertheless, the
man whose ambition, drive and ability
won the Vietminh final victory against
the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954,
and have since given the “Democratic
Republic of Vietnam” a large and well-
disciplined conventional army.
During the Indo-China war he recog-
nised, but also resented, the huge debt
the Vietminh owed to China, whose
leaders had provided him with training
facilities in camps across the border,
and with arms and advisers in the field.
About 300 Vietnamese officers and
NCOs still go to China every year for
specialist training. Giap may welcome
an “escalated” war, if he believes that
it will finally give strictly-rationed Com-
munist North Vietnam her chance to
overrun the rice-bowl of the South. But
he also knows that the wider and the
more intense the hostilities become, the
more his country will be dependent on
China, (ofns)

OUT AND ABOUT
Look Back in Gladness
Sydney in the days of the trams , the dole and Jack Lang
By LARRY FOLEY
Out our way the main job was the
breakwater at Clovelly. Making
a hash of it they were, too, we
thought experts. They merely blasted
the rocks then dumped them higgledy-
pickledy in the water. And the men
were half-hearted; they stood around and
yarned.
Watching, we caught snatches: Scullin
this, Bruce that, Hoover and Wall Street,
and if-only-they-listened-to-Jack-Lang. It
was over our heads. But one thing we
knew: this wasn’t proper work.
Digging ditches, mending roads, lay-
ing drains, spreading gravel, shovelling
sand, making concrete, laying bricks,
raising telegraph poles, cutting grass,
sweeping streets, anything that was doing
we were onto. We knew all right, how
men were when their hearts were in their
work: sure and steady, head down, no
fits and starts; stop for a blow, dash the
sweat, straighten up, catch a boy’s eye,
return shy smile with a wink, spit on
the hands and— swing thud grunt, swing
thud grunt. They had dust on their eye-
brows. The breakwater men never
winked.
A baby might fall asleep to the sound
of real work. A boy wouldn’t; he wasn’t
going to miss a thing. Some things would
not let him go, might even make him
late for school. Like coming upon men
unloading bricks. Tossing them two at
a time, man to man to man, lorry to
footpath to stack, stack dwindling row
by row on the lorry, stack growing row
by row on the ground, and only men
with bare hands in between, catch-turn-
toss-turn, catch-turn-toss-turn, until in
no time the lorry was empty, and every
toe intact, not a finger squashed.
Rhythm was the secret. That and
teamwork. Some years later, learning
to row, I heard an old coach: “It ain’t
all brute stren’th and stoopidity,” and
I knew suddenly what it was that had
made men working so good to watch.
FACES AND PLACES: The
second of a series of occasional
pieces.
Fitzie had it, Fitzie the smiling street-
sweeper, who held his wide, hard broom
against his wide, hard belly and nudged
it along the gutter with stately tread,
confident, supreme, an emperor sweep-
ing all before him. So, too, did his
skinny mate, Laurel to Fitzie’s Hardy ;
who followed after, scooping up the
neat, spaced heaps with his long bright
shovel and, all flowing motion, tossing
them cleanly over his shoulder into the
high cart, that was always right there,
he didn’t have to 100k —for Old Dobbin
had it, too. We picked extra-special
bunches of grass from the foot of the
paling fences for Old Dobbin when they
stopped at the trough up the Top. And
we got on the other side when he drank,
to see the water sucked in. All the time
his great brown eyes were on us, and
when we tickled his nostrils with a
feathery stalk or pulled his ears or
tugged his whiskers, he went on drink-
ing, drinking. When he finished, he lifted
his head and snorted, and a fine spray
went on our faces. We could crawl under
his belly and a kid didn’t even have to be
game to do it Old Dobbin just stood
there, swishing flies.
Yes, Old Dobbin had it. But not the
breakwater builders; they had no rhythm
and they were not a team. They were
all-sorts soft-handed some, with pale
skins and no muscles. But we didn’t
sling off at them. Nobody did. Because
of the Depression. We knew they were
relief workers, and that there was an
army of them, all over the country. It’d
be no use trying to cadge a penny for
an iceblock off any of that lot. If we
had tried, and our parents heard about it,
they’d have gone off pop. Anyway, some
of our own Dads were on the dole, and
doing relief. Nobody had any pennies
to spare.
A penny did not pass lightly through
our hands. Ha’pennies did. Two ha’pen-
nies went at once. But a whole penny
was a thing of beauty, to be enjoyed for-
ever a whole day. But as the day wore
on it became harder to resist, the others
asking all the time when you were going
to spend it. While you had it, you
treasured it. If it was a new one, you
shined it even more; you looked at the
date and the King and read out all the

letters and things he was. He had a short,
pointy beard, just like the Johnos’ grand-
pa, who shuffled up and down all day in
his slippers on his squibby little front
verandah, that was right on the footpath
nearly, and not even high, like a proper
verandah, but level with the ground.
We spent our pennies at Mag’s, down
the Bottom. Mag was big; her shop was
tiny. She had a massive bosom “the
one with the big hearts,” our little sister
said when asked which one had served
her. Mag’s sister Bessie, younger and
pretty, was sometimes behind the coun-
ter. We preferred Bessie. Mag got fed-up
when we were buying lollies. We couldn’t
hurry. We had to see what was new,
calculate, compare, assess, and know how
many a penny before we could even
start. Then it was a cautious, not-quite-
decided “one of those . . . no, those . . .
THOSE . . . and two of these . . . yes,
them . . . and that . . . and some of
these . . . oh, that’s more than a penny?
Well . . . not that this ...” Why, it
could take easy all day to spend a penny.
But where Mag would heave big sighs,
and cluck, and even go away and come
back later when she thought we were
ready (we weren’t), Bessie would follow
our discussion keenly, with a tight face,
as though trying not to laugh, and when
finally we had made up our minds, and
chosen, she’d say, gravely: “These are
very nice, very sweet, and they last
wouldn’t you rather . . .?” and we’d be
back where we started, in an agony of
uncertainty.
Bessie was nice. We didn’t say Bessie
to her, but. We said Miss Kerwin. We
were always polite to grown-ups.
We repaired to the gutter, or to some-
body’s fence, or front grass, or steps, for
our beano. If you had a bull’s-eye, you
had to stick out your tongue every
second, to show the different colors.
When it got down a bit in size you stuck
it in the side of your gob and said:
“Look, I’ve got a gumboil.” With an all-
day sucker you could be one of those
African natives with duck lips that we
saw up the Bughouse, between Tom Mix
and Felix the Cat and Hoot Gibson and
Tarzan of the Grapes we always said
Grapes. The trouble with hundreds-n-
-thousands was they went too fast, though
they were good while they lasted, and
you could spend a lot of time chasing
separate ones around your back teeth and
under your tongue, where they hid, not
wanting to go down. A lickerish strap
was the best for lasting, because you
rolled it up tight and only let out a little
bit at a time, to nibble. You had to keep
showing your tongue with that one, too.
We swapped things and gave anybody
a taste of things that, unlike jellybeans
and aniseed balls and lickerish cigarettes,
were not easy to divide or share, and
when not a skerrick was left, teeth and
lips sucked and licked clean, and tongues
back to normal, good now only for
poking at people, silence fell. At last one
would say, with the air of having a secret
to tell:
“Do you know wot?” #
“No, wot?”
“You’re mad nime not!” And there’d
be a scuffle.
A kid who wouldn’t share was a
minge, or a mingy thing, or a stingy
cow. If he wouldn’t give you a go on his
scooter, or dinky, or trolley, or fairy
cycle, or three-quarter size bike, he was
a lousy cow. But if he was out on a full-
size bike, his big brah’s —legs too short,
bum down this side, up, down the other
side, up, bike wobbling (but we owned
the road) and when he came back you
could see his tongue stuck out a mile on
one side, to balance you wouldn’t
ask him for a go, because you knew if
he did his big brah would know (big
brahs, like mothers and fathers, always
knew) and wouldn’t give him a lend of
it again.
The big brah
A younger brother began as a baby
brother, graduated to little brah,
then to young brah, then to young bro-
ther and finally, soon after he got hairs,
to plain brother. An older brother was
always your big brah until you could hit
back, whereupon he became, simply,
your brother.
My big brah and I shared the family
shopping on Satdy mornings, the biggest
job. I did my messages down Burnie
Street in the billycart, he did his in the
trolley, up the Top, up to Charion Cross,
even up to the Jungo. He was a good
shopper, who could be relied on to stand
his ground with the barrow-men and not
come home with any crook ones; and to
count his change. There was a sturdiness
about those kids; you’d see them weaving
along crowded footpaths, their parcels of
meat, groceries, bread, fruit and vege-
tables piled in their trolleys, themselves
half-perched on the back, leaning for-
ward with hands on the front corners
of the box to keep the weight down,
reins between fingers, one foot on the
short tailboard, the other trailing, push-
ing out behind with !azy, regular motions,
tough bare sole dragged on the ground
to brake.
Home at last, the first thing Mum
went for was the eggs, to see how many
were broken and to save what hadn’t
dripped away already; they sold loose, in
paper bags.
Afterwards we went out to ride our
trolleys, if it was the trolley-riding season.
(It might be kites, or mibs, or tops, or
buzz-saws, or footer, or yo-yos, or
cricket over the fence six and out and
fox the ball. There was a season for all
things. There was no announcement, no

starting date, no decisions; you just
knew. You woke up one morning and it
wouldn’t even occur to you to go out
with your kite or whatever it was you’d
been mad about for the previous month
or more.) Usually two rode in a trolley,
one to steer, behind snug in the box, the
front removed or cut down so the legs
could move, feet on the cross-bar push-
ing, hands on the reins pulling, thus
keeping the swivelling front axle under
control; the other to push, one foot on
the tailboard, scooter-fashion, or going in
fits and starts, first running like mad to
get up speed along the flat, then perching
on the back until she slowed down, jkt
the top of the hill, the passenger could
either squash in facing forwards, or sit
facing backwards, feet trailing. If the
trolley didn't have an automatic brake —
a pedal on the centre-board, linked to
brake-shoes made from old leather heels
nailed to flat bits of wood on each rear
wheel then the passenger was brake-
man, holding a stick or two sticks under
the rear axle beside the wheels, ready
to lever upwards.
Some had racing trolleys, the box
little more than a shallow tray, to cut
wind resistance, and low-slung, because
of ball-bearing wheels. You greased cast-
iron wheels with fat, kept in a tin nailed
to the centre-board; but ball-bearing
wheels were oiled, with a proper can. A
racing trolley with ball-bearing wheels
made you King of the Road; it was like
owning a Rolls C’nardly (can ’ardly get
up the ’ills see?). As it was shallow, you
could explain to your mother that you
couldn’t do the messages in it. But it also
meant you couldn’t make any dough with
it, like doing some other lady’s messages
for a zack or so, and collecting manure
(bob a load, Missus).
“The Flying Milkman”
VTearly everything came by horse-n-
-cart: Gartrell White the Bread Man;
the milk-o, in sandshoes for quiet, and
always on the run but, unlike Dave “the
Flying Milkman” Stephens of later years,
who was aiming at the Olympic Games,
ours was merely aiming at getting down
the Back early to fish; the ice-o, Georgie,
who had Ginger (but he bit) and a pony-
cart with bags over the ice, and who
shared the neighborhood with his father,
George, who went round in a cranky
Dodge van (and we clustered, elbowing
each other, holding out our hands to
catch the spurts of ice chips as his rust-
browned, big-toothed saw went to and
fro, and clamored, “Bit of ice please,
Mister Rowles? A clear piece.”); the
wood-coal-and-coke man; the clo’es-prop
man, who had a funny, strangled cry and
a blue cattle-dog that trotted with tongue
hanging out in the shade beneath the
cart, darting out only to fight our dogs;
the bottle-o, collecting our empties at a
ha-penny each in beery sugar-bags, his
load clinking merrily, uniform sizes
stowed row upon row, odd ones in bags
hung on the side; the Chinaman with the
fruit cart, his rosy apples polished with
spit (we knew); and the garbos, always
running, bang and clatter (“Mummy says
don’t bang the rim!” But they did) —
running to get away from their own
smell, we said.
Near the end of winter kids asked:
“Broken the ice yet?” It was good to be
the first to. We’d be waiting and wait-
ing for the first hot day. We’d be
playing and all of a sudden somebody’d
say they were hot and take their jersey
off and next thing, somebody’d ask who
was game for a swim and next thing,
we'd all be flying down to the beach,
brave as anything, and when we got
there it wouldn’t be hot at all. We’d
get goose-pimples, and kneel down on
the edge to put one hand in and leap
back before anybody pushed us in. Then
the splashing would start and somebody
would get pushed in and come out
splashing really this time, and then it
was last in lousy, and anybody who
squibbed it we all piled onto him and
got his arms and legs and one-two-three,
in he went.
When the official season started—the
papers always said when—we used to
mock all the kids coming down in trams
from Kenso and Paddo and all those
places that didn’t have beaches, because
they were still white and by then we
were real brown and had peeled already
and been swimming for two months
nearly, and even before brekker if there
was no school that day.
We didn’t like those kids. Lairs and

Salt water can’t harm this boat...it’s care-free aluminium from prop to prow!
While timber will yield to the sea and many
metals will decay or rust, Alcoa’s corrosion-
resistant aluminium alloys defy deterioration.
They also offer strength, light weight and many
other desirable properties.
Alcoa of Australia has a whole family of such
alloys specifically developed for corrosive con-
ditions. In marine use, for example, their
applications range from the hulls and motors
of pleasure craft to the superstructure of
giant ocean liners. For other outdoor purposes,
properly specified aluminium alloys withstand
weathering practically maintenance-free, even
in sea-coast and industrial environments.
Typical users are truck bodies and transmis-
sion towers, light standards and lawn furni-
ture . . . and an entire range of building
materials, from windows and siding for homes
to aluminium cladding for towering sky-
scrapers. Containers made of these alloys are
even used to transport certain hard-to-handle
chemicals like red-fuming nitric acid and
hydrogen peroxide.
Aluminium conducts heat and electricity, and
reflects heat and light. It is non-magnetic,
non-toxic, and impact absorbing. It is less
costly than other non-ferrous metals, and is
available in every form known to the metal
working industry. Aluminium has a wider range
of finishes than any other metal, providing

sand-throwers, they were. We never
threw sand, except sometimes, and not
where other people were, specially
grown-ups. But those kids, who didn’t
know anything about beaches, and be-
tween-the-flags and that, they mucked
up all over the place, and trod on
people’s faces that were sunbaking. We
never had anything to do with them or
played with them even if they had a ten-
nis ball and we didn’t, else we might get
blamed, too.
They were great scalers, though, better
than us, jumping off backwards and
standing still, at full pelt, easy as pie.
That was because they got more trams
than us, and more practice. All we had
were the ones at Clove and Bront’, and
the trammies soon got to know us, and
if they saw us hanging around they
watched us until the tram was too far
off to chase, even when we pretended
as hard as we could that we weren't go-
ing to try to pinch a ride. Some were all
right; they pretended they didn’t see us
and when we got off after a couple of
stops they winked and we winked back,
if we knew how to wink. It didn’t mat-
ter down there, near the end of the run,
because there were no inspectors around
there. Mostly we only wanted a ride up
from Bront’, to save the steep climb
home and all those steps. It wasn’t so
steep the way the trams went, through
the cutting only trams, no cars or
people—but it was a million times longer
to walk. What we did to pinch a ride,
not really scaling, on the footboard on
the wrong side and dodging the conduc-
tor, but sitting on the seats with all the
other people, was this: we’d watch until
we knew the conductor was about to
pull the strap. We could tell: he’d have
been up to the little white house, and
come back, and rolled a smoke, and
had a bit of a mag with the driver, who’d
already have taken his driving tool up
to the front cabin, that had been the
back cabin on the way down, and the
conductor would have changed the
poles over, so pretty soon there was
nothing they could do except start. The
moment we saw which end the conductor
would start collecting fares, we’d rush
onto the other end. By the time he got
to us we'd be off: we only went three
stops.
Asphalt like ovens
VTearly all the footpaths and streets
“*■" going home from Bront’ were as-
phalt, which was like an oven by dinner-
time. Your feet would get burnt off
nearly. We skittered and skipped and
pranced, hopped and jumped, hobbled
and sprinted, on heels, toes, sides, from
safe spot to safe spot, shady patch to
shady patch, along gutters and sandstone
kerbs. We dashed for the wet patch
where a garden spray came over a fence,
cooled suffering soles in preparation for
the next dash, for which no guerrilla
leader ever studied terrain more closely.
Each of us chose his own route, though;
every man for himself. It was the only
way, because the patches of shade were
small, when the sun was high, and might
only take one pair of feet at a time. And
so we came at last with shrieks and
whoops and giggles, to the best oasis of
all: the trough at the Top. Feet went two
by two into the shallow base that was for
dogs, arms went deep into the horse
part, and there we hung, while the dogs
wormed their way between our legs and
flopped down in the watter, lapped and
looked up gratefully. That was bliss,
and so was the last run home: downhill,
and grass. Down to the Tree and then
along the Back Lane. Grass. Bliss.
Then home —through the back gate, a
hinged section of the paling fence, not
to be swung on or the fence would fall
over; under the lines of washing, the
nappies too high but the sheets and
grown-up towels just right, so throwing
our heads back to let them, cool and
fragrant, caress our sunbaked faces;
Mum, waiting to feed us, with “There
they are at last!” to whoever was with
her, Dad or an aunt perhaps, and some-
thing about brown scows; and to us
“Where have you been, you monkeys?”
but not expecting an answer; and, “Wash
your hands first!”, sharply. Which we
did, some in the bathroom (no wash-
basin, a single tap over the bath), some
over the laundry tubs, some at the kit-
chen sink, and bar the fishpond—that
was the quickest, but not fair. All in
haste, for it was on the table already,
and somebody else might get first pick.
Meals at Our Place were noisy. We
knew everything: whose birthday, who
had a sore toe and how they got it, who
caught an occy or an eel, who was away,
who had mumps, who was the best run-
ner, who was the best fighter, who was
a tattle-tale, who was a big fibber, who
was a skite, who had a mama doll, who
had a car, who had a wireless, who was
bottom, who was top, who got paddy-
whack the drumstick in the Bubs’ and
what they did, who wasn’t speaking, who
got a bad mark, who got kept in, how
to get from here to anywhere, who had
had a new baby at their place.
Whenever we brought home the news
that somebody’s house had a new baby,
our mothers never seemed surprised.
All the kids said that; their mothers
knew. Nurse Apps Certificated brought
them on her bike. In her big handbag.
She lived up the Top and along Mac-
pherson, opposite the little three-corner-
ed park, near the Bigs’.
The Tree at the Top
TTalfway up the Top at the end of the
Back Lane was the Tree. This was
our favorite place. It was at the end of
the Back Lane, which ran between our
back fences and the cemo wall. The
Tree was the whippy for hidings, the
base for releasings: we tied our prisoners
to it, for safe-keeping or for torture; we
tested our pocket-knives on it, carved
our initials on it, cut our twigs for cata-
pults from it, climbed it, lay in its shade,
undermined its roots, lit fires at its feet
to cook spuds, played Tarzan on ropes
from its branches. Impartial, the Tree
judged our foot-races, looked down on
our fights, saw the traps we set in the
long grass for the enemy and the pitfalls
dug for the unwary, heard our whispered
secrets, witnessed as we spat our deaths
and crossed-our-hearts-and-hoped-to-die,
rustled its leaves as we chose who was
to be IT, in conclave to the chant of
ellery bellery ripty rah, ripty rah tee
rolla; stood by as we picked sides, calling
wet or dry or chinese-tossing for first
pick or first go; and above all saw fair
play and sometimes foul, and surely
nodded when we yelled cheats never
prospered. Our misdeeds and our drops
of blood from cuts and noses, the Tree
covered with a gentle fall of leaves.
The point opposite the Tree was the
best place to climb the cemo wall; here
it was at middle height. The Wall, our
own Great Wall of China, was a massive
rampart topped with a picket fence and
made of sandstone blocks, rough-hewn,
just right for fingers and toes, and where
they weren’t, why, we worked away at
the mortared cracks and crevices until
they were. In time we had discovered,
or created, a number of routes up the
Wall: some for convenience, some
chosen as a test of nerve and muscle for
each to win his spurs, and some, known
but to us, for escape—from an avenger,
an attacker, an irate parent. To be
half-way along the Lane, the fiercesome
tread close behind and getting closer,
and then to be suddenly half-way up the
Wall and out of reach, the baffled pur-
suer scrabbling at the Wall with hands

not privy to its secrets; to reach the top,
look down, spit in his eye and call him
Spot . . . thus we came to taste the heady
wine of triumph. From that point our
disappearing act was virtually complete.
No one would ever catch us in the cemo.
The graves were our friends. We knew
the geometrical maze down to the last
dead end. If the pursuer was determin-
ed, and finally conquered the Wall, in
the face of the handfuls of pebbles
scooped from the nearest grave and
showered upon him, or came in by the
nearest gate you jeered and taunted, led
him on, on to the ground that you
knew best. If it was distance you must
put between yourself and your pursuer,
easy: the paths between the graves ran
straight and narrow, north-south, east-
west, on and on for hundreds of yards,
grass, too; no gravel or blue metal or
searing asphalt to slow the bare of foot,
however fleet. So it was run, run, never
swerving, never a look behind. The
paths led straight into the sky and down
to the sea. Run. Stop. Down. Let
the pursuer pound past. Come out.
Jeer: here 1 am! Off down a side-path
now. Run. Run and run. Stop. Down.
Listen. Silence, but for your panting
and the pounding of your heart. Peep,
up. Gosh! There he is. Run. Run run
run run run run run. Behind a vault
then another right-angle turn and run
run run. Stop. Not a soul in sight.
Safe. Unless you start to giggle, from
relief, and give yourself away.
Playing dead
Tf the pursuit was not fast, and dis-
tance not needed, why, then, the
master of the situation merely ran a little
way in among the graves and hid, to
peep out now and then and move when
the hunter got warm. Years later, learn-
ing to soldier on the bare hills of Ingle-
burn, and told the secret of camouflage
and concealment —freeze into the back-
ground— I thought, loftily: Every kid
knows that.
The birds and the lizards in the cemo
taught us. Play dead, they said, and
did. And so did we, and it always
worked, except when your dog had
caught you up. Your dog would al-
ways give you away, with his silly wag-
ging tail and idiot yapping. Thinking
it was a game, when it was a matter of
life and death. Yap-yap, wag-wag, no
good lying doggo now. So up and run-
ning again, run run run run run.
The cemo was our refuge, our play-
ground, our private paradise. We were
always in it. (Except in the dark; we
knew that’d scare the living daylights out
of us, game as we were.) There we
chased, we hid, we raced, we hunted;
we counted the graves and made our
wishes at the Norfolk Pine Wishing Tree
and picked up the long, spiny, willowy
leaves (a quick twist, break the outer
covering, draw gently and out came the
fibre core, long, white, tapering a
natural scabbard and rapier of true
Toledo steel . . . on guard, for your life,
D’Artagnan!)-, we cawed back at the
crows, laughed back at the kookas, made
lizards shed their tails, hunted the Big
Goanna, tried to start fires with flints
off the graves down the Back where they
tipped the dead flowers and wreaths;
filled our pockets with pebbles for cata-
pult ammo. We read the tombstones.
Nearly everybody was rip. Nearly
everybody was dearly beloved. Some
were only beloved. Some just born and
died. Some people were lots of people
all in one: dearly beloved wife mother
sister grandmother great - grandmother
aunt cousin sister-in-law, but nobody we
found was anybody’s best friend, or even
just friend. The longer you lived the
more you were. We’d sit on a grave
with soft grass and work out how many
each of us was. We weren’t very many
—brother or sister, son or daughter,
nephew or niece, cousin, and owner of
dog so-and-so or cat so-and-so or little
mother of Dolly; then we ran out of
ourselves. We reckoned, after some
discussion, that we were dearly beloved,
but anyone who’d just been roused on
might say he didn’t think he was, now;
so we’d make him just a beloved.
Burial in process
T ife’s mysteries solved, and death's,
we’d spring off our tails and dash
away, quick as starlings, as noisy and
twice as bold, whooping and leaping from
grave to grave, tearing along the paths,
towels a-flutter if we were heading for
the beach, clad only in cossies, our dogs
barking, leap-frogging down the wider
paths —to be brought up short by a
burial in process: long faces, hankies out,
dark suits, black bowlers, black dresses
and hats, glittering hearse and one for
the flowers.
A few minutes, watching, then we’d
flit away, hushed at first but soon in full
cry again, startling pigeons and doves
and lizards and women in beads and
hatpins, kneeling to snip grass; some to
pray. We did not tarry and caught the
tst-tst-tst-tst as we passed, the sound our
mothers were always making. If the
Sick Stockrider were there and he’d
have been in one of the nameless, un-
tended mounds we preferred to sit on,
that were kinder to small behinds than
sharp-cut marble —he must have heard
us romping overhead, and been glad;
we were not sad.
We went everywhere, and when we
went anywhere, we didn't just walk, or
stay on the ground, we ran along the
tops of people’s front fences and walls,
balancing, if there wasn’t a dog; and if
you toppled inside, they all yelled:
Missus, there’s a pig in your yard! until
you got out. We climbed trees we came
to or leaped up and swung on branches,

and looked ahead for things we just
might be able to touch if we took a
flying leap (and if you missed, you al-
ways went back and tried again).
If a group of kids passed us, as we
idled in front of our place or at the Tree,
they wouldn't say anything, and neither
would we. But the dogs would. Ours
would bristle, theirs would bristle, both
sides would yell “Skitch’im, Boy!” and
everyone would scatter and climb onto
fences and walls. It was best to be off
the ground during a dogfight. Dogs got
carried away, and could just as easy bite
any leg that got in the way. And every-
where was in the way, with dogs. Dogs
fought all over the place, not like boys
—except brothers at home; they fought
all over the place. You formed a ring
for boys. But you couldn't for dogs.
They had their own rules. Dogs came
in handy, at such times. Must have
saved us plenty of fights.
We, us and co.
lITe were never gangs. We were never
" in any sense organised. Nobody led.
In the morning we'd just go Out, and
we’d find somebody else who’d just gone
Out, and we'd muck around together for
a bit, then we'd go up to somebody else’s
place and call him. We never went inside
the gate or rang or knocked; we just
stood in front, or sat on their fence if
they looked like being a long time com-
ing, and called his name and out he’d
come, unless he stuck his head out the
window and said he wasn’t allowed out
or had to mind the Baby or his mother
was Out and he had to mind the house.
If we didn’t have anything better to do
we might stay and help him mind the
house; but not the Baby we each got
too much of that at home.
Eventually a loose kind of formation
materialised in the street. The word for
it came to me years later, when we
switched from night ops to daylight stuff
and flew in a loose formation called a
gaggle. But unlike a gaggle of Lancs,
whose progress was purposeful, our for-
mation might drift like a small cloud on
a summer’s day, here, there and every-
where within a radius of three or four
miles. We didn't have gangs, or gang
fights, out our way. They did in Paddo,
and the ’Loo, and Surry Ills, and Red-
fern, places like that. And Dario —the
razor gangs were there.
But we were no gang. Just we, us
and co.
Years later, in places like Liverpool,
and London, Naples, New York and
Chicago I saw, appalled, what we, us
and co. might have been turned into
there, under those so different skies,
among those not-so-different people; and
I looked back in gladness.

Two Years’ National Service...
... and the sooner the better?
By T. B. MILLAR
On October 6, 1959, the then
Minister for Defence, Mr Town-
ley, said in Parliament that the
question of amending the existing Nat-
ional Service training scheme had “not
even been considered” by the Govern-
ment. Just 51 days later he announced
the end of National Service “after a
most careful review”.
Perhaps heartened by knowing of this
apparently rapid turn of events, various
individuals and groups are now urging
the Government, only a few weeks after
it has announced a series of defence
changes, to bring back National Service
training on a selective basis. While
everyone is entitled to press his point of
view, it would be surprising if Cabinet
were to amend so drastically its an-
nounced programme before it has been
tried out or even introduced.
National Service training is not of
course an end in itself. The end is the
defence of our country, and the provi-
sion, therefore, of sufficient trained per-
sonnel. The Government decided in
June of this year to continue trying to
obtain and retain servicemen by volun-
tary methods, and to meet our defence
commitments on this basis. Accordingly
it introduced incentives —increased rates
of pay, better housing facilities, and
remission of tax on CMF pay. It also
undertook to bring down legislation
which would enable the CMF to be
called up for full-time service in situa-
tions short of general war but in which
there existed “hostilities on a limited
scale or the threat of such hostilities”.
It announced the establishment of
Volunteer Emergency Reserves, of ex-
regular servicemen, who would be avail-
able on immediate call “in times of
operational necessity”.
Only if there is a substantial “hotting
up” of the situations in South-east Asia
or Malaysia/Indonesia is Cabinet likely

University. An abridged version of a

School appeared in The Bulletin

to change its declared recruitment policy
within the next few months. For politi-
cal and other reasons, the voluntary
system must be squeezed dry. The
Federal Opposition, and some others who
are now belaboring the Government over
defence matters, would not in any case
react kindly to the introduction of com-
pulsory training.
Nevertheless, the public is still entitled
to ask whether the recently announced
policy, if successful, would be adequate,
and what the Government is planning to
do if it is unsuccessful.
It is understood that the Army’s aim is
to increase the regular strength to about
28,000 (which means, presumably, to
provide a full third battle group for the
Ist Pentropic Division) and to raise the
equivalent of a battle group in the Emer-
gency Reserve, a, ‘‘fillers” and reinforce-
ments. In the event of the Division
being committed to action in an emer-
gency, it would be minus its two CMF
battle groups for an initial period of 3-6
months of training; that is, it would
either act as a Task Force or the battle
groups would be committed individually.
If the time comes when we will com-
mit ground combat troops to the defence
of Borneo, the fact that we do not have
a full regular division may not be vital.
Even the battle group may be too big an
organisation for some purposes. But if
we are committed to operations on the
mainland of South-east Asia, it would be
highly desirable, for reasons of effective-
ness, logistics, and of playing our full
national part, that we should provide
a whole division at the initial stages,
with a strong follow-up and reinforce-
ment capacity. And the possibility that
we may be simultaneously involved else-
where is not at all remote.
Not many people are very sanguine
about the success of the Volunteer Emer-
gency Reserve Plan. But even if it were
to come up to expectations, it would
not go near to meeting our requirements.
A standing army of 35-40,000 would be
needed to maintain operations of the
order mentioned. And operations of


that order must be envisaged in terms of
our treaty commitments and the apparent
threats to our security.
The United States’ role in South-east
Asia is well known. It is not usually
realised that the United Kingdom, whose
interests in South-east Asia are now
strictly limited, also has more servicemen
in the area than we have in all our regu-
lar forces at home and abroad. An
Australian army of 35-40,000 would be
about the same proportion of our popu-
lation as the current British Army is of
Britain’s. On present evidence, it would
seem that only a recruitment system
which is partly compulsory could pro-
vide the additional 10-15,000 men we
require.
Wanted: Regulars on long term
rpHis is roughly the number of service-
A men which were being trained
annually during the last three years of
the previous compulsory scheme. And
yet that scheme was considered unsatis-
factory by both the Army and the Gov-
ernment. The Minister gave, as reason
for abandoning it, the “excessive de-
mands” it made on both manpower and
money, without adequate compensatory
military advantages. Nearly 3000 Regu-
lar Army personnel were involved in
administering and training national ser-
vicemen. One reason for this high figure
was the short period of full-time service,
almost wholly devoted to recruit train-
ing, during which the intake provided
very few instructors or junior leaders
from among themselves.
Having completed their full-time train-
ing, the national servicemen were posted
to CMF units, on whose strengths there
were also both volunteers for overseas
service and volunteers for home service
only. The fact that these three categories
would require cross-posting in an emer-
gency was eventually discovered to be
hazardous to their effective employment.
It was quite right of the Army not to
want to continue with this system. It
was eminently understandable, in view of
the problems of administering a com-
pulsory training programme, that the
Army should want a field force of regu-
lars on a long-term engagement. There
is no doubt that, on such a basis, we now
have the most effective peace-time army
in our history. It would be entirely ade-
quate if only South-east Asia and Indo-
nesia would stay reasonably quiet.
Volunteers are usually, though not
always, better military material than con-
scripts. Thus, to get the best overall
results, any national service scheme
would have to integrate the two, as is
done elsewhere.
Our long-time sensitivity to conscrip-
ting for overseas service, due to a re-
luctance to fight what were believed to
be other people's wars, was substantially
invalidated and eroded in World War 11.
It is a dangerous anachronism today.
No farmer would wait for a bushfire to
reach his fences before attempting to
put it out. Few people can claim and
fewer still can believe that a war only
becomes relevant on the ground as it
reaches our borders, or at sea or in the
air at the three-mile limit; but this is
the reductio ad absurdum of the opposi-
tion to conscription for overseas service.
Our sister nation of New Zealand has
no such inhibitions. And, as has been
recently pointed out, we were enabled to
retain as much as we did of the volun-
tary principle during World War II be-
cause of the protection afforded us by
American and British conscripts.
New Zealand currently has a national
service programme similar to the one
we had at the time it was abandoned;
that is, a selective system, with a 14-
week full-time training period followed
by three years in the Territorial Force
(CMF). However, the enlistee in New
Zealand has the alternative of opting to
serve a full year in the Regular Army.
Either way, he must finally serve three
years on the reserve. He is liable to
call-up for overseas service on procla-
mation of an emergency or war by the
Governor-General.
Something more than this is needed
for Australia. The Government has ac-
cepted the principle of sending our
forces overseas in circumstances short
of general war. It takes 6-8 months to
train recruits up to the stage of combat
readiness in their fighting units. Spe-
cialists and leaders take longer. It would
be absurd to send troops overseas with
the obligation to bring them back two
or three months later. Anything less
than a two-year engagement (extendable
in time of war) would be a waste of
training, of funds, time, personnel,
equipment and facilities.
The American system is closest to
what we need, and merits examination in
some detail. Every male resident of the
United States must register with the
National Selective Service (or “Draft”)
Board on attaining the age of 18 or if
aged between 18 and 26. After medical
and other tests, registrants are classified
according to priority of call-up. In the
highest priority are single men not en-
gaged in full-time study, in agriculture,
or in certain other occupations. Students
are not exempt; they merely have their
service deferred.
The Army makes known the extent
of its needs for draft personnel, and
proportions are allocated to each Draft
Board area according to the numbers
registered and available there. It is then
the responsibility for this board (com-
prised of local members) to supply its
quota. Other things being equal, older
men (up to age 25) are taken first. In
practice, most draftees are inducted at
around the age of 21.
Under the Draft law, a young man
has several options:
• He may just wait for call-up, with
the possibility of being passed over if
not all of those who are eligible are
required.
• He may volunteer for a two-year
term of service (the normal draft period)
in which case he will definitely do it,
but will usually have an opportunity to
decide when his service is to begin. This
choice can be very useful to him in
arranging employment. On completion,
he goes into the Reserve (CMF).
0 He may enlist for three years in
the Regular Army, thereby gaining the
opportunity to choose his branch, theatre
of service, and date of beginning.
9 He may, if there is a vacancy in
a local unit, enlist for three years in the
Reserve. He is then called up for six
months* regular training, followed by a
period of 1\ years in his Reserve unit,
during which he is liable for call-up in
any emergency.
• If he has the basic qualifications
for the Military Academy at West Point,
he may enlist for one year, do initial
military training, and sit for the West
Point entrance examination. If he fails,
he may be discharged or may extend his
enlistment for one or two more years.
All draftees serving on full-time duty
for more than a year are subject to
assignment anywhere in the world. Those
who volunteer for three years receive a
big pay rise at the end of the second
year, and are given greater opportuni-
ties for specialist and technical training
than the draftee. With their parents’
consent, volunteers may enlist at the
age of 17.
Military training and academic courses
tTIHE draft system provides officers,
NCOs and instructors. A private can
rise to the rank of sergeant during his
two-year term; or, at the completion of
his basic training, he can volunteer for
officer candidate school. If accepted
and he passes the course, he is then
obliged to serve two years full-time.
There is also an officer candidate scheme
at universities, geared both to military
training on a part-time basis and the
satisfactory completion of certain aca-
demic courses. After four years (the

normal length of an American first de-
gree course) the candidate may be com-
missioned. He is not then subject to the
draft, as such, but must serve two years
fuii-time.
Medical and dental graduates have
similar opportunities and obligations.
And men who have completed other
scientific, technical or trade training at a
university or technical institution provide
a most valuable reservoir to draw on
for relevant military technical posting.
Some aspects of the American system
may be a little exotic for us, but there
is much we could adopt or adapt from
it, including the principle of calling up
only the numbers needed and able to be
absorbed, and the initial three-year term
of service for the Regular Army. Be-
cause it is only a year longer than the
draft period, and because f the other
incentives offered, many young men
volunteer for the Regular Army, or for
the Navy or the Air Force, rather than
wait for the draft. They would be less
likely to do so if it meant a further four
years of service, which they would have
to do with our present six-year engage-
ment
To bring in, in Australia, a national
service scheme similar to the American
one, even though suitably scaled down,
would be a considerable undertaking.
Our Regular Army understandably does
not wish to lose a substantial part of
its fighting component to train national
servicemen. Yet, if one accepts that the
situation to our north is likely to get
worse rather than better, and that we
will eventually have to introduce com-
pulsory training and service, it would
seem that the sooner we do so the
better, and the sooner we start planning
for it the better. It would probably
take something like a year to get opera-
ting satisfactorily.
Is there an alternative to depleting
our field force to provide instructors?
Some depletion may be inevitable in the
early stages, yet there are ways it could
be minimised, if national service were
given the necessary priority.
The initial call-up can be a small one,
and the build-up gradual. The present
ARA recruit training staff could be ex-
panded by drawing, for a time, on the
regular staff of cadet and CMF units,
neither of which is as important in the
short term as the provision of a larger
standing field force. It is not impossible
that there may be officers, warrant-offi-
cers and senior NCOs who are currently
filling posts at Army or Command Head-
quarters and who could be temporarily
released to administer or train national
servicemen, without seriously affecting
the Army’s overall efficiency. There
may well be ex-regulars, or CMF offi-
cers, who would be prepared to accept
full-time appointments for a year or two.
After a time, unlike our earlier scheme,
the system becomes largely self-sup-
porting up to junior officer rank.
A major problem of a selective system
is the actual method of selection, and
the problem is accentuated when the
numbers required are only a fraction of
the numbers available. To have a bal-
lot was not unduly inequitable when the
term of service was three months, but
a term of two years requires a much less
chancy process.
Some may bear greater burden
HThe fairest method would seem to be
to sub-categorise according to age,
employment, or other criteria, to call up
everyone who is eligible within the sub-
category, allowing appeals to an appro-
priate body. Even so, some inequities
are unavoidable, although they could be
reduced by providing incentives to volun-
tary enlistment. Nevertheless, it is vital
that our country be adequately defended
even though some citizens may have to
bear (as some always do) a greater pro-
portion of the burden.
All this discussion has related to a
national service scheme for the Army.
The other two services are smaller, more
glamorous, and have a higher propor-
tion of technicians requiring long periods
of training. They thus have less need of
a compulsory system, and even a two-
year term of service would be inadequate
for many “musterings” The United
States gets around this problem by utili-
sing men who have already undergone
civilian technical training, and by “break-
ing down” technical operations and thus
reducing the degree of training required
of some technicians. The first we could
do; the second is probably beyond our
capacity and desire. There are, of course,
various lesser positions in both services
which a two-year trainee could fill.
The Navy would seem to need
national service if (but only if) there is
a naval expansion beyond that currently
publicised. Yet the preliminary plan-
ning of any compulsory programme must
include all services, so that there will be
no undue delay if implementation be-
comes necessary.
It is often claimed that any expendi-
ture on defence means less to spend on
national development. If all the Federal
revenue not spent on defence were spent
on development and if the amount of
Federal revenue was fixed, this claim
would be valid. But, as the Budget has
just reminded us, this is not so. In any
case, in the ultimate situation of a
clear threat to our security, defence must
have priority over development. In less
than the ultimate situation, the priority
given to defence over other public or
private spending is a matter for the
Government’s judgment. But it is not
especially credible or honorable to assert
that preoccupation with national deve-
lopment precludes or should exempt us
from meeting our defence commitments.
What is proposed, therefore, is a
scheme of compulsory military training,
planned for all three services but initially
brought into operation only for the
Army, with a period of service of two
years, and to include overseas service if
necessary. It would be universal in
coverage but selective in operation,
taking in only the number the Army
needed and could handle. It would be
brought into operation gradually, up to
an annual intake of some 7-10,000 un-
less the international situation required
otherwise. The cost is hard to estimate,
but it could be around £2O million per
year, which is less than the prize-money
at our race-tracks.
This would not make a great demand
on manpower; it need not detract from
development. The Army is capable of
the effort and organisation involved, and
few Governments could be in a better
political position than the present one to
make, at the appropriate time during
the coming year, the necessary though
courageous decision.

QUEUING FOR THE FINAL CACHET
Tt is well known that Melbourne is
in world class as a good queuing
town. Perhaps we do not have the
neatness or perfection of behavior of
some of the London queues, but
nobody beats us for endurance.
Furthermore, we have proved our
quality by the very purity of our
queuing. Our queuers are not motiv-
ated merely by a desire to be first or
by a crude need for tickets. As the
psychologists have told us, it is the
companionship that is so important,
and the comfort of standing one
behind the other. If one is in a queue,
then one belongs, one is part of the
mob. By standing in a queue the
queuer proves to all that his judgment
is correct and that he is seeking all
that is most desirable.
At this time of the year it is the
custom to sell the football tickets for
the final series of four matches. And
they sell the lot, all magnificently
calculated down to the last square
inch of space. On the day of the
match the only ticket sellers are the
scalpers.
Well, seeing that there are at least
150,000 who want to see each match
and the little MCG holds only
100,000, every year there is agony.
Every year the MCG tries a different
system. This year it worked three
ways. There were 11,000 tickets
available by mail order, but getting a
couple of those is like winning Tatts.
Then, on the Monday, the MCG
opened 26 selling points around the
ground to sell 22,000 tickets to pri-
vileged football club members. On
the Wednesday the remaining seats
were sold to the general public.
At this stage you must understand
that the normal red-blooded Melbur-
nian football-goer doesn’t give a damn
about getting a seat. Actually he pre-
fers to stand, week after week, ankle
deep in mud and cans. And there is
no difficulty whatever in getting stand-
ing-room tickets. They will still be
available for the next two weeks.
However, finals are different. There
is a certain cachet in possessing final
seats, almost as good as having let-
ters after one’s name, so it is impor-
tant to fight like hell to get them. The
newspapers give the complete battle
plans down to the last detail, the
location of every selling window,
times of operation, the lot.
So this year the queuing was
splendid, of a far higher order than
for the Beatles. You see, the weather
was magnificently appalling. The
wind was blowing straight off Maw-
son at speeds up to 57 mph. The
rain, as it likes to do in Melbourne,
drizzled constantly and on Sunday
morning there was the supreme mo-
ment when it snowed in Flinders
Street for half-an-hour between 7 a.m.
and 8 a.m.
The crowds started to queue im-
mediately after the Melbourne-Essen-
don match on the Saturday, and
steadily built up to some hundreds
during the week-end. Take the cases
of Mrs R. Drew, of Box Hill, and
her friend, Mrs F. Morcom of Mur-
rumbeena. They parked their car and
trailer right outside the ticket window.
They kept warm by a log fire, slept
in the trailer, and tried to keep happy
with every comfort. For example,
they cooked three-course meals on a
primus stove often soup, steak and
a sweet. They kept a vase of flowers
on the ledge of the ticket window.
Being Essendon supporters, natural-
ly, they dried their dishes with an
Essendon tea towel. Then for extra
decorations they hung up little foot-
ball knickers in Essendon colors.
A nd so through to the freezing Mon-
day morning when the crowds
had grown to 6000 and the average
queue was 500 deep. The South Mel-
bourne Club queue was phenomen-
ally long, and, seeing that South Mel-
bourne is almost at the bottom of the
ladder with little interest in the finals,
one had to be suspicious of what those'
swan lovers planned to do with their
tickets.
Ticket selling began at 8 a.m.,
and within half-an-hour there were
rumbles of mutiny. Many of those
who had queued for days, to their
horror, received tickets way back in
V or W, tickets not half so honorable
as an A or B. Immediately there were
cries that the VFL had been cruelly
treated and it was all unjust to club
members.
lan Johnson, secretary of the MCC,
said the reason that the queuers did
not get the best tickets was simple.
Of the tickets available to the clubs
each club took 400 for officials and
players, and, being human, 400
naturally were in the front rows. He
said, too, that the VFL clubs already
received more than 40 per cent of all
tickets, while they made up only 30
per cent of the crowd. What’s more,
they could come back again with the
general public on the Wednesday.
And, to get back to our friends
Mrs Drew and Mrs Morcom, that’s
exactly what they did. They were so
dissatisfied with their Monday tickets
that they decided to continue their
queuing camping marathon right
through until the Wednesday. lan
Johnson says they nailed him outside
the ground, complained about their
former treatment, and said that if
they did not get good tickets this time
they would pitch a tent in the passage
outside his MCC office and stay there
until they did. Victorian football fans
have spirit.
However, Mr Johnson explained
the whole ticket set-up and Mrs
Morcom and Mrs Drew found him
so charming that they invited him to
the camp for a cup of tea and a
slice of toast cooked on the primus.
Actually, on the Wednesday ticket
sales went very smoothly indeed; Mrs
Morcom and Mrs Drew received
lovely tickets and told lan Johnson
they thoroughly enjoyed the whole
experience. Actually, there was little
need to queue at all. Anyone who
arrived at 9.30 would have been
through in 15 minutes, certainly not
with front row seats, but with reason-
able viewing.
The irony of it all is this. The
system was devised to cut out our very
real devotion to queuing and to wipe
out all queues on the days of the
finals. But it doesn’t work.
Next month they will still be camp-
ing out for four days for the supreme
honor of the standing positions im-
mediately behind the goal posts.

ART
Portraiture in Australia
... Lord De L'IsLe, sadly distressed in a blue tent
By ELWYN LYNN
It is time that the combined State
Galleries arranged a survey of the
course of portrait painting in Austra-
lia, from the early ingenuous delineators
to contemporary ecstatic expressionists.
Despite common complaints about its
decline in Australia, it has survived not
only as an artistic industry but also
as something of general interest, partly
due to the role of William Dobell and
the Archibald Prize which attracts en-
tries from every State and into which,
each year, more and more experimental
and avant-garde portraits shoulder their
way, not, one must say, unwelcomed by
the Trustees, though it is said that this
is the only way the Prize can be kept
alive.
Little has been written on the progress
of portrait painting because portraits are
the most difficult of paintings to trace;
they are scattered in private homes —
often as the objects of ancestor worship
—church and school halls, Government
offices and in gallery storerooms. It
is easier to come by portraits of the
unimportant and obscure, usually not
called portraits until more democratic
times, but labelled when first done as
“Head of a Young Girl” or “The Pastry
Cook”; and it is more easy to see—
especially in Sydney’s Mitchell Library
the early colonial portraits.
These small and intense portraits,
obsessed it seems to us, now, with exact-
ness and verisimilitude, were determined
to record with painstaking care the fea-
tures, uniforms and families (the child-
ren shining like bright medallions com-
memorating their parents’ excellence).
They have uncongested, uncanny clarity.
All, with one important exception like
Wainewright (1794-1847), the forger
and supposed poisoner, who produced
genteel portraits of fantasies of wide-eyed
Victorian female modesty, placed their
bigwigs against backgrounds with an
isolated and regal dignity that was a
colonial defiance of the badlands. Such
dignity is now permitted Archbishops
and Governors, but even Lord De L’lsle
appeared solemnly and sadly distressed
in a blue tent recently designed for him
by Clifton Pugh.
When egalitarianism and democracy
began to prevail, portraits became parts
of the furniture or the landscape; the
environment was not defied or subdued
by the portrait, for the portrait simply
played its part in an aesthetic whole; at
the end of the last century and in this,
with the Meldrumite tonalists, portraits
floated up from a background, emerged,
smudgily from, as it were, the brown-
black democratic mass, but only just.
This levelling was due as much to
painting techniques as to egalitarianism.
In France Manet had made a mild
Westernised Japanese of Jules Clemen-
ceau, “The Tiger”; and Tom Roberts
was following in Australia a modified
impressionism that involved the melting
of forms into backgrounds, though in
most of his portraits, as in “Henry
Parkes”, here illustrated, he often rever-
ted to his early training as a portrait
painter, for it seems that the loose touch,
the flickering note, the casual dash and
playful curlicue are not for men of fame,
dignity and distinction. It was Russell,
working in France, who was amongst
the pioneer Australians using a light and
fractured stroke, as in his portrait of
Dr Maloney. The darker school, and
especially these following Meldrum’s and
Perry Leason’s notions of what Vela-
squez was about, had a theory of light,
which they seemed to think was com-
posed of brown sauce and blue icing.
Thousands of heads and bodies came to
be disguised in such color.
Tt seemed that Australian portrait paint-
ing was to be tied to bigwigism
when Archibald in 1919 endowed an
annual prize, now worth about £560,
for the portrait of a man or woman
“preferentially distinguished in Art, Let-
ters, Science, or Politics, painted by an
artist resident in Australia during the
twelve months preceding”—an odd be-
quest from the “sardonic and mercurial
editor of The Bulletin, a man”, as
Dr Bernard Smith says, “who had spent
a lifetime exposing hypocrisy, preten-
sion and status-seeking”.
Never had a prize ushered in so many
slick and flattering prize-winners, yet
what Dobell did with Joshua Smith in
1943 might have suited Archibald’s
sense of irony, because Dobell’s por-
trait brought into art what public figures
feared —the caricaturist, who had princi-
pally flourished in Archibald’s Bulletin.
When the family, friends and syco-
phants suggested, even insisted, that the
great man’s portrait must be painted, he
knew that was a chance to be commem-
orated rather than cartooned and lam-
pooned. Suddenly, it seemed that with
Mr Justice Roper’s decision in the
“Dobell Case” that this last refuge was
cut off. Those who had brought the
case against the Trustee’s award to
Dobell stated: “It is alleged that the
picture is not a portrait but is a carica-
ture of Joshua Smith”. In dismissing
the suit Mr Justice Roper settled the
issue, legally at least, stating: “It is, I
think, unnecessary to consider whether
the picture could be properly classed as
a caricature or a fantasy. If it could be
so classed that would only establish to
my mind that the fields are not mutually
exclusive.”
The decision seems to have promoted
little caricature (Louis Kahan did show
Robert Hughes recently as a stevedore-
armed white-faced rebel) or satire in
the last twenty years, but there has been
plenty of expressive distortion.
Time creates as many problems as it
solves; how can one look at “Henry
Parkes” by Tom Roberts (1856-1931)
without being influenced by the debunk-
ing of this century and without thinking
that here is Karl Marx in a Sunday
school version, with a touch of patriarch
and even the seer. All that beard and
undenominational education, too!
How have our portrait painters,
famous themselves, coped with the fame
of others? Has it been a duel to see who
will achieve most fame from the en-
counter. It seems an even result: the
painter practises his art, the sitter his
pose.
Richard Read practised in Sydney be-
tween 1814 and 1826: a skilled minia-
turist, he was able to get Mrs Macquarie
in bonnet and quaintly-folded ruff on a
piece of 31" x 2f" ivory, and employs
the same exactness in his “Governor
Macquarie” of 1822, a portrait from
life that has some of the benign, though
leaner, firmness of Ivor Hele’s portrait
of Sir Robert Menzies on the cover.
Each has a quiet half-smile to lessen
the intensity of the gaze of the “last of
the autocrats” (the last?) and of the
calculating shrewdness of the Prime
Minister. Neither portraitist is inter-
ested in unplumbed depths of personality
or quirks of behavior; there is none of
the sensual arrogance often found in
Hele’s portraits, little of his bravura, as
he catches a fleshy, not complacent, but
robust intellect.
It is easy to believe the multitude of
stories about Sir George Reid from the

rotund portrait by James Quinn (taught
by Bernard Hall and well grounded in
Manet and Velasquez) with its face full
of placid irony and cravat worn like a
pirate. The equivocation of “Yes-No”
Reid of Federation fame is epitomised
by the way the lively diagonal contrasts
with the somnolent and slightly veiled
look; a portrait praised by Sir Lionel
Lindsay in 1931 as a “masterpiece of
character, detachment and interpretative
ability”.
Sir John Longstaff (1862-1941) was
a natural for the greats, yet he was best
when he dispensed with their public trap-
pings. He does isolate Sir John Monash
in a khaki landscape where his neat
uniform perhaps symbolises the order he
imposed on the chaos all around, but
little of his personality emerges. What
do we learn of Dame Nellie Melba
where the regalia is even more tempor-
ary? The filmy veils of cloth, where the
paint is now badly cracked, hardly les-
sen the effect of a healthy and strapping
figure at a Country Women’s Association
Conference.
Tn Longstaff’s Paterson, something of
the Australian type is emerging; hardly
handsome, the occasional bushman wears
that awkward blue suit that country folk
have seen at weddings and funerals for
half a century. Something wistful,
something utopian and faraway, lies in
the eyes of the creator of the Man from
Snowy River and who was, as Major
Paterson, the first officer George Lam-
bert, as official war artist, met when he
reported for duty in Egypt in the 1914
war.
The portrait for Henry Lawson could
be the other side of the coin of the
Australian type —retiring, slender, laco-
nic and melancholy. Here, with this
brown suit that was Everyman’s per-
sonality and to egalitarianism trium-
phant.
If Lawson is the unpublic public
figure, George Lambert’s (1873-1930)
“William Morris Hughes” is all tense PR;
there is none of the quiet and uninvolved
topographer of battle areas in this Lam-
bert. The figure is poised, perched like
a bird; staccato edges protrude in pro-
fusion—lapels, collar, sleeves silhouette,
all contribute to the acute and eager pre-
sence. How relaxed and atypical is the
portrait of Hughes by Augustus John in
the Gallery of NSW.
While Hughes seems about to pounce
on the common weal, Lambert’s “self-
portrait” cares nothing for what is com-
mon; the artist of the lighthorseman,
done up in apparel by Velasquez, Orpen
and Art Nouveau, defies egalitarianism,
portrays the artist as a very healthy and
aristocratic bohemian, poised in an atti-
tude of flamboyant and elegant disdain.
Was he joking? It is so un-Australian.
At the other extreme, does egalitarian-
ism become condescending or conscience-
stricken as with William Dargie’s “Albert
Namatjira”? After the colonial por-
trayals of the Aborigines there was little
interest in them except from a few artists
like B. E. Minns, and latterly Bergner
has treated them as socialist-realist sym-
bols of oppression and Drysdale as
rather noble savages. Dargie’s portrait
is really a gesture in a noted Aborigine’s
direction, a conciliatory and consoling
icon. Dobell’s “Scotty Allan”, on the
other hand, catches a remarkable per-
sonality, and at the same time epito-
mises a quizzically amused independence.
A pilot with the Royal Flying Corps and
co-pilot with Charles Kingsford Smith,
he symbolises one of the few individual
acts of necessary daring—at a time when
a pilot listened to his own heart beats
and did not have them recorded back on
earth.
Similarly the “Portrait of Donald
Friend” is the summation of an era of
painting when artists like Russell Drys-
dale, Jean Bellette and Paul Haefliger
made of Hill End a minor Heidelberg.
The Dobell and Dargie are more monu-
mental than Donald Friend who shares
the contrived scene with the church.
(Later Drysdale was to paint its interior
glowing like a Rembrandt.) Man is once
again related to his environment, here a
cultural one as much as one of the bush.
The satirical and amused Friend stands
in an arranged landscape and even if the
face is orthodox, the painting’s implica-
tions are that the organisation of the
setting is as important as the person.
The portrait is not in favor with avant-
garde painters though the greatest of
abstractionists, William de Kooning, has
done them in the midst of his abstract
career because it does not allow the
iconoclasm and experiment of other
modes, yet it is an art of subtle altera-
tions in its development, and not only
repays study for the way it reflects art
changes and social attitudes, but also
teaches the importance of close and con-
tinual application at a time when every
breeze that blows bears the Songs of the
Artistic Sirens, in very form and color,
from the seductive international scene.

ART
Artist and Adventurer
The imagery of lan Fairweatlier
By JOHN HENSHAW
lan Fairweather. Recently at the Mac-
quarie Galleries, Sydney.
Tf William Dobell made his debut, as
far as public awareness is concerned,
in the Archibald Prize controversy of
1944, lan Fairweather may be best
associated with his voyage, in the late
’forties, across the Arafura Sea on a
flimsy raft to Timor. That he is also
a painter of real distinction hasn't quite
clicked yet, except when he is written
about as the scholar-anchorite of Bribie
Island, Queensland.
Fairweather, seventy-four this year,
combines the activities of several person-
alities adventurer, wanderer, hermit,
philosopher, seeker after erudition, artist
• —into a colorful amalgam wherein depth
has been achieved within an immensely
varied life. Experience in China, the
Philippines, the East Indies and Europe
informs his brush, his subjects emana-
ting a kind of authority of statement
which comes from long distillation of
such experience. Sometimes the threads
are tenuous which connect with place,
factual or imaginary; they exist never-
theless. The ease with which he can
arouse visual association and yet remain
a free manipulator of abstract qualities
recalls the skill of an elderly conjurer,
master of his repertoire, in need of no
gimmick and having forgotten all he ever
used anyway.
A rough parallel may be drawn be-
tween the positions of lan Fairweather
and the American Mark Tobey relative
to their countries’ contemporary paint-
ing. Both have been equally imbued
with the .traditions of Chinese art, espe-
cially its calligraphy. Although Fair-
weather has not achieved a finality of
line, it clings to the visual even when
it is least obviously so; he often em-
ploys it as a light element in his work
a kind of “white writing” which Mark
Tobey has exalted to expressive inde-
pendence. Tobey’s line, of course, has
less rhythm but greater complexity and
nervous excitement. His preference is
for Ba’hai philosophy, whereas Fair-
weather’s is for the Chinese.
Cubism has supported Fairweather's
imagery with those geometric compart-
ments over which the line floats in an
ideal space a centimetre or two above
the surface. But line can also be the
tilting edge of a cubistic plane which
angles itself out a formless recess. There
is the certainty of a Persian decorator as
well as the description of multiple
aspects of forms: an Oriental carpet is
shaped, hung in a shallow niche with an
elegantly simple border.
It is not difficult to see the restless
energy of a European intellect delving
into 20th-century discoveries in art, or
to trace the Slade-trained draughtsman
informing the play of line, but these
acquired skills have long ago become
tools of Fairweather’s intuition. Without
this they could function independently,
but fortunately they do not.
T>icasso once said that a picture came
A to him from a long way off. This
could mean a number of things, one
being that it drew together threads of un-
conscious feeling and lifted them into
visible expression. Some such impression
comes from the contemplation of Fair-
weather’s work, centred as it is in no
particular locality or any definite time.
His arabesques owe little to immediate
analysis of form however usual; they
spring from a conscious recollection.
They evoke rather than penetrate, echo
rather than grasp, invite without asser-
tion or violence, opening silently the
back door to a realm which is Fair-
weather’s own. Although belonging to
the old guard in the Australian contem-
porary movement, his painting betrays
an exuberance and vitality that makes
many of his juniors look terribly stodgy.
In spite of the lack of very important
works, one or two of which usually
grace his annual shows at the Macquarie
Galleries, this 1964 selection was very
interesting. Paintings were medium-
sized, couched in terms of his highly
reduced yet suggestive range of color;
naples, ochre, bistre, slate, blues, black
and a few distinctive browns, greys and
deep greens. Summary forms swing from
the ideograph to the pictograph, depend-
ing on the degree of abstraction. “Science
Fiction” belonged to the former, “Black
Boys”, with its vague reference to tote-
mic sculpture, to the latter category.
Somewhere between the two “Rain
Drops” played on an off-circular theme,
at once creating an image of radiating
wavelets on dark water and making a
purely abstract sign for rain. Water
figures prominently as the curtain on
which an aerial view of the “Boatman”
was lined in light or from which the
“Lady of the Lake” emerged in enigma-
tic and very un-Victorian splendor. The
big brown head of “Banjo” was typical
of the series Fairweather has created over
the years, some of them turning into
highly searched out, deeply felt, self por-
traits, facets of his art that have not
received much attention. “Zoo” en-
closed a fine selection of serio-comic
beasts set behind some flimsy cage bars.
Within this mixture of satire and serious-
ness, “Punch and Judy”, in tawny yel-
lows, pinks and greys, was seen with the
experience of a lifetime and with the
poignant candor of a child.

CBS Reports: The Flight from Holly-
wood. Channel 2, Sydney.
TI/tth a huge army of assistants, colla-
boration from several national
archives and broadcasting commissions
(including the ABC), the BBC has pre-
pared perhaps the most monumental of
all TV documentaries. “The Great War”
began the Sunday before last with “On
the Idle Hill of Summer”, and taking the
snatch of a Housman poem as its point
of departure, evoked the last, legendary
golden sunset of Europe before the final
curtain descended. Michael Redgrave's
narration smooth, with an undertone
of tense neuroticism was ideally
spoken, and the music of Wilfred Josephs
beautifully supported the images. A
sleepy Sunday in August, 1914; boating
on the Thames; shots of idyllic country-
side; horses clopping down Rotten Row:
all this evoked an England that still seems
dream-like and remote, a paradise all too
surely lost. And, on the other side of the
coin, the camera moved jerkily across
the grim face of the Midlands, valleys
scarred by the industrial revolution, 17
per cent of the population below subsis-
tence level. Bleriot flew the Channel;
Kaiser Wilhelm inspected troops, and
in an unforgettable sequence —we saw
the monstrous Krupp works, a self-con-
tained hell where 80,000 workers toiled
an 80-hour week and were lucky if they
got an annual holiday, where they were

born, lived and died under an impene-
trable blanket of factory smoke. This,
surely, must have been the inspiration of
Fritz Lang’s “Metropolis”, made 11 years
after these scenes were shot.
Nine kings followed Edward Vll’s
funeral, their high, white helmet plumes
waving; at the Delhi Durbar in 1911,
119 princes and maharajahs bowed in
homage to England’s king; the railway
was laid from the Cape to Cairo; in
Russia the Czar inspected troops; then,
with complacent plump faces, Franz
Ferdinand and his consort rode out in
their death-car, Princip fired The Shot
That Changed the World, and the ideals
of Europe were shattered forever.
The material was often familiar, the
commentary inevitably •- covering well-
trodden ground, but the period retains
its eerie, remote, fascination. The ugly,
cramping clothes, women dressed in
black shrouds and cauliflower hats, the
smallness and wanness of the men, the
lost beauty of a south-east England be-
fore the slurbs moved in few would
object to seeing all this again once a year.
CBS on “The Flight from Hollywood”
was below its best. Instead of really
getting inside the sheer badness of the
films which helped television to wreck
the old Hollywood, the producers
arranged interviews with stentorian rep-
resentatives of the Old Guard—George
Stevens, Preminger, Huston, and, of all
people, that tired hack Robert Ardrey
who reeled off predictable cliches and
loudly reasserted the values of the indus-
try. None of the more dynamic American
film critics were interviewed—one would
like to have heard Dwight Macdonald’s
views, or Stanley Kauffmann’s —nor even
the victims of the Hollywood Un-Ameri-
can Activities investigations, which strip-
ped half the talent from the place just at
the time when it could least spare that
talent. In pompous fashion, CBS simply
let the big noises tell their story in the
flat, mindless prose of their own Press
releases, gave us a swathe of balance
sheets and UCLA extension course
economics, and in the end seemed to
provide a plug for “Cleopatra”, almost
proudly saying how it had begun to re-
coup its costs despite the Cassandras.
What we wanted was a probing analysis
of the faults in the Hollywood of the
early 19505, its growing contempt for
its audience, its reckless misuse of talent,
its conformism and cruelty, and its self-
strangling by committee rule and round-
table hassling. What we got was a semi-
animated brochure issued by the Motion
Picture Industry Council, stamped, sealed
and delivered for consumption by the
hicks. A sell-out, I’m afraid.

IZ en Hughes is not an experimentalist.
He lacks perhaps deliberately
avoids the fashionable smart-intel-
lectual approach. One of the most
neglected English film-makers, he has
without fanfare made a series of intelli-
gent, tightly-constructed films; he con-
centrates on technique, not pyrotechnics.
“The Small World Of Sammy Lee”
shows with unsentimental compassion a
few disastrous hours in the life of a
born failure. Sammy is compere of a
Soho strip-tease show—about as classy
a profession as piano-playing in a bawdy-
house—and he has only a few hours to
pay a large gambling debt or be beaten
up. In the intervals of the sieazy strip
show, Sammy rushes to friends and
“contacts”, forced into ever shabbier
expedients to raise money.
The script, written by Hughes himself,
is terse, idiomatic, packed with implica-
tion at the end we know more about
Sammy than could be told in a hundred
flashbacks. Anthony Newdey, with his
surface smartness belied by dead, des-
pairing eyes, gives a splendid perform-
ance as the failed hustler, inevitably
doomed to slip back three steps for every
two forward.
The distinctive flavor of Soho—dingy,
brawling, vital —is sharply evoked by
Hughes and his fine cameraman, Wolf-
gang Suschitzky.
In contrast to this unobtrusively pro-
fessional job there is “Night Must Fall”
from two of the bright boys of English
cinema, Karel Reisz and Albert Finney.
They’ve taken the Emlyn Williams
play, a straightforward, slam - bang
thriller, and dolled it up with arty
direction, “significance” and popular
psychiatry. The result is pretentious,
affected and dull.
The original piece of expert popular
theatre is a melodrama about a mur-
derous charmer who ingratiates himself
with an elderly invalid and her com-
panion. There’s no nonsense about
psychology though Danny’s habit of
carrying round a severed head in a hat-
box is admitted to be eccentric.
But Reisz and Finney are so busy try-
ing to explain what makes Danny tick —
with Freud-for-beginners references to
mother fixation and paranoia that
they somehow miss all the genuine
though meretricious excitement of the
play and its first screen adaptation.
Anyway the film is doomed from the
start by the staggering miscasting of
Albert Finney as Danny, but since he
was co-producer he must bear the blame
for it. Producer Finney sees that actor
Finney gets a good go. and about two-
thirds of the film is taken up with
enormous close-ups of Finney glaring
into space and registering battiness.
The rest of the cast over-acts embar-
rassingly (Mona Washbourne, Sheila
Hancock) or doesn’t act at all (the pallid
and droopy Susan Hampshire). The only
exception is Michael Medwin, who
actually resembles a human being but
understandably bounces off in a huff
halfway through the film.
We're only allowed four of the
original five episodes of “Love At
Twenty”, the Polish sequence directed
by Wajda having been dropped to fit
the film into the bottom half of a
double bill. What’s left has lost its
original dialogue, and almost everyone
speaks in that flat, shallow' American
accent only to be heard in dubbed
movies.
The exception is Ishihara’s Japanese
sequence, where the actors are afflicted
w'ith comic accents of the “Ah so.
Takako is in rub with you” variety. A
pity, since the sequence looks as if it
might be pretty good, and the photo-
graphy, with its extraordinary feeling
for contrasts of light, is memorable.
Francois Truffaut’s sequence has the
tantalising interest of a director’s work-
ing-sketches for a full-length film. The
Italian and German stories (Renzo Ros-
sellini and Marcel Ophuls) are note-
worthy only for having been directed by
the sons of famous fathers.
A lot of funny films have been based
on the situation of a book-expert faced
with the embarrassing need to put his
theories into practice. “Man’s Favorite
Sport” isn’t one of them. Rock Hudson,
who is about as witty as a steamroller,
plays the fishing “authority” and, for
Thalia’s sake, he doggedly but unavailing-

Orchestral Concerts. Conductor,
Rafael Kubelik. Sydney.
“TTere language is no longer purified
of the flourishes, but the flourishes
of the appearance, of their subjective
domination. The appearance of art is
thrown off at last. Art always throws
off the appearance of art.” Thus
Kretschmar, in Thomas Mann’s novel
“Dr Faustus”, on Beethoven’s last piano
sonata.
These remarks came to mind at two
recent concerts given in Sydney by con-
ductor Rafael Kubelik and soprano Elsie
Morison, which featured two arias by
Haydn, one by Mozart, and one from
Stravinsky’s opera “The Rake’s Pro-
gress”. The Mozart concert aria “Good-
by my fair one”, K. 528, might well
have been used by Kretschmar as another
example of his point. All the gestures
and mannerisms of late eighteenth-cen-
tury music were there, but incorporated
into a musical whose whole logic and
meaning are free from the convention-
ality that the presence of these manner-
isms would imply in the case of a less
gifted composer.
The Haydn arias, while not trans-
muting the raw materials that went into
their construction in the way that the
Mozart aria does, are nevertheless effec-
tive within the limits that their conven-
tions impose. Haydn’s use of these con-
ventions is, as it were, congruent with
their formal possibilities.
It is with some puzzlement, then, that
one approaches Anne Trulove’s recita-
tive and aria, “No word from Tom”
from “The Rake’s Progress”. Here the
appearances of art have not only been
thrown off, but constitute the very ele-
ments out of which the art is composed.
Lacking the historical and musical
necessity that they had in their time, the
mannerisms of eighteenth-century music
are here treated as being that from
which music is made, rather than that
which limits and guides composition.
The problems that arise in assessing
Stravinsky’s neo-classical music are only
evaded by praising its obvious and ex-
pert craftmanship or its “brave tunes”
(which is only another way of saying
that it sounds like something else). How
does one approach music whose basis is
parody? To be able to deal with this
problem adequately, one would probably
need to be able to stand aside from
eighteenth-century music in a way that
few contemporary listeners can.
Elsie Morison’s performance of these
arias was admirable, displaying a fine
voice and strong but unobtrusive drama-
tic gifts. Rafael Kubelik’s conducting in
these and in other items in the two con-
certs often exhibited more dash than
care. However, at its best, as in Brahms’
Fourth Symphony, Kubelik’s conducting
has a strength and genuineness that out-
weighs these defects.

¥>olished, sophisticated and beautifully
A relaxed, Julie London’s singing is
displayed to great effect on her new
Liberty release. The years haven’t
affected her at all; she is here every bit
as good as she was in her classic
“Calendar Girl” of a few years back.
The numbers range from the quietly re-
flective (“Since I Fell For You”) to the
brusquely modern (“You Don’t Have
to be a Baby to Cry”) with a raucous
female choir accompanying her.
St Vitus, the patron saint of teen-
agers, would no doubt approve. Even
when the song is positively banal (the
Benjamin-Weiss “Wheel of Fortune”),
Miss London turns it into a smoothly
painless experience. “Wives and Lovers”
is most inventively scored and sung.
“The Best of Peggy Lee” is an
irreplaceable album, an authoritative
collection of the star’s greatest hits, and
some numbers not so popular. The
settings, supplied by Gordon Jenkins
(suave and effortless), Victor Young
(sweet and tacky) and others are all
outmatched in quality by Miss Lee’s
cool, elegant delivery of the lyrics.
“Black Coffee,” “I’m Glad There is
You” and “He Needs Me” are perhaps
the classics in a collection the work
of years that no addict can possibly
do without. This is certainly the season
for Lees.
Lionel Long’s “Long Ago” includes
several pleasant traditional songs from
England, among them “Barbara Allen”,
“Greensleeves” and “The Four Ravens”,
sung without affectation, but considerable
warmth and ease. Mr Long’s sanguine
temperament and lack of fashionable
“sociological” concerns may alienate him
from some of the folk-singing cultists,
but as a non-specialist listener I find
him consistently agreeable. Best of all,
he is not worried about being Australian,
and the clean directness of his per-
formances is entirely indigenous.
A New Zealand pianist, Judy Bailey,
leads a small and beautifully recorded
combo in “You and the Night and the
Music”, a very “American” pressing,
accomplished and, in “Night and
Day”, agreeably glossy—without adding
anything very new to the nightclub-
contemporary idiom she’s working in.
On “Latin, Lush and Lovely” Morton
Gould and his band enjoy themselves
hugely, tricking up some solidly familiar
South American material; technically,
this is a particularly brilliant recording,
the surface immaculate and the separa-
tion of the instruments impeccably
realised. Even in this age of near-per-
fection, a special nod to the engineers.

/Ane of the more interesting develop-

so much. It was a straightforward, un-

pleasantly staged and immensely funny
in parts. The music and lyrics by
Stephen Sondheim were charming and
the book by Shevelove and Gelbart witty
and original. Original? It was at that
stage that I had a suspicion which
turned into certainty. Shevelove and
Gelbart’s book of “A Funny Thing . . .”
is based on another book —the plays of
Plautus. This information in the pro-
gramme’s fine print gave me a vague
sense of disappointment as if I had just
seen a thoroughly enjoyable and original
musical called “A Funny Thing Hap-
pened To Me In My Chariot”, only to
find that it was a musical comedy based
on an original novel by Patrick White,
or “A Funny Thing Happened To Me In

POETRY
Participation
Hamlet mostly dies about eleven;
all heroes must die early or die late;
the point is: death permits me dine at seven,
and sleep at midnight switches off their fate.
But what of him whose act is more intrusive,
who will not die within a nice suspense?
In his theatre, boasted as exclusive,
exits are lacking for his audience.
LAURENCE COLLINSON
This is how I die
In the country, asleep,
Sigh the trees, the waters
And the sun-god's daughters,
And slow lizards creep
Bearing tokens and signs.
Here, with dumb cunning
Rabbits are running
The moon into cloud. Lines
Of darkness cross, and sigh
In my blackened brain.
And then the rain . . .
This is how I die.

Late April: Hobart
Turning from the mirror full of leaves
that draws the autumn garden through the room
I note that brown's the color of decay,
but in the garden how it just achieves
a sense of balance between rot and bloom
where old chrysanthemums fall all one way
as if an angle meant avoiding change.
Thick with its burden of excess and loss
this time of year depresses and elates:
all points of stillness hover out of range;
wind strips the season to its sticks and dross
and days to a blue scratched out of southern slates.
This autumn garden is decay of gold,
a waste of mildew, fading reds that glow
as in bare boughs the brown and gold respond.
Each day the corners lengthen shades of cold
and silver rain gives way to mountain snow
and black and sour grows the lily pond.
Gone are the statements of the summer dawn
when love grew more abundant with excess;
sustained by filth, fertility survives.
Fulfilment needs its time to be withdrawn
in its own silence, much like holiness.
In time each shifting harmony arrives.
And now it’s this dark brevity of gold
with so much withering as colors glow
as if the frugal with the fecund mates.
The sunlight dazzles with its April cold
and through the red the brown begins to show.
Beneath it all such final bareness waits.
VIVIAN SMITH
The Acrobats
Five shabby dancers in the circus dust,
Five midgets balancing their grief. I must
Tell of their hour upon the glittering stage:
Laughing like gutted dolls, crying like owls
Stiff in the public’s gaze, quelling their rage
Under the sheeted arms that stretch like sails.
Once they were young, and capered through the
tents,
Drunken and flushed with their first innocence.
It lasted little. Beauty was not long.
Those pretty things their limbs grew sharp and frail.
Once born they had to know another wrong.
Lines crawl across the cheeks. Time thrusts the nail.
Now in their teetering pyramid of arms,
And legs the cracks threaten their earthly charms.
Applause whips like a snake about their heads,
Where once it broke like tempests. When it goes
All they can do is reach across a bed
And hold each other in a sad embrace.
For centuries the Wessels knew the air.
Lights searching, steel wires taut, they danced up
there,
For generations whirled above the ground,
Swinging and dancing in an endless waltz,
Their stark geometry matched to each sound
Of drums and fifes and timpanies and flutes.
Then came an hour when the whole structure went.
That perfect discipline shrivelled and bent.
They fell into a net. The mob did not
Forgive the act. Soon they were grounded. Then
A finis was inscribed beneath the plot.
Now they are not quite known as gentlemen.
It doesn’t matter, nothing does. They go
Happily dancing in the sawdust glow.
Lamely climb up on shoulders, sing and clap,
And wave thin hands across the shadow-line.
In every ring they toil and toil the trap
Like insects struggling round a vat of wine.

Anzac Gardens: 11th November
A greed of parrots wrench at the black-bean flower
quick and aloud till the twisted petals fall:
the old man lies on the grass below, still
among torn stains and tapestries of color
and birds with ruthless parodies of laughter.
Unwillingly, he hears how they take their fill
then rush off over and high away with a shrill
clatter, eagerly, at nothing the matter.
Rest is not easy. Although he has turned from the
sun
and city and feels the still soil as neighbor,
and shuts his eyes, lying face down,
yet he waits in strain to hear if the birds return
to the silent tree, alone among falls of flower
thrown down recklessly, the honey gone.

RED PACE
The Threat of the Mafia
A code of inverted honor
By ALEXANDER PORTEOUS
The Honoured Society. Norman Lewis.
Collins. 38s. 6d.
T>ecent events have made the Mafia
and similar movements no longer
of merely academic interest to Austra-
lians. If there are such organisations
here then it’s important to understand
as much as we can about them; if there
are not, then it’s equally important to
clear away the confusions called up by
the use of the term, and to distinguish
the real nature of the problems of the
Victoria Market.
And even if it is established that no-
thing of the kind afflicts Australia, the
whole Mafia mess is of clamant concern
to anyone interested in what may turn
out to be the big national question for
the next forty years: how can the politi-
cal and social institutions that add up to
Western liberal democracy be defended
in the face of hostile and destructive
pressures within such societies? The new
societies of post-war Japan, post-
independence India, emergent Africa
face enormous difficulties from without
as well as within, of course. But with
increasing urgency it becomes clear that
the old Western societies in many cases
are dogged by difficulties almost as in-
tractable. France in uneasy dependence
on one man's charisma, the USA in
agony, even Canada threatened by the
unsuspected liveliness of its inherited
tensions, latent antagonisms, erupting in
ugly fashion in Belgium, economic un-
certainty becoming political sickness in
Britain—the liberal decencies seem be-
leagured indeed.
And the old, tired, torn societies of
Southern Europe suffer, it appears, in-
curably: Greece, Spain and the south of
Italy, still trapped in the bitter and
squalid legacy of Neapolitan corruption
and cruelty. Mr Lewis’s book presents
a survey of Mafia activity in Sicily since
the Liberation in 1943; and a depressing
story it is.
But before descending further into
gloom, one ought, no doubt, to examine
Mr Lewis's credentials. Unfortunately,
he hardly makes them available: the
book lacks any but the most fragmentary
documentation; there is no bibliography,
and no clear means of evaluating the
“immense, painstaking research” of
which the blurb speaks. On the other
hand, the respectable publishers, one
imagines, would hardly utter a work of
such claims without fair reasons for
accepting its authenticity; and Mr Lewis
appeals again and again to newspaper
references, court reports and other re-
cords which can be followed up. The
trouble really lies in the origin of the
book as a series of “New Yorker”
articles; simply to assemble these was
not to make them the most valuable
book that this could have been. Without
introductory explanation or commentary
of any kind the chapters are title-less
and the reader is left to realise as he
goes that this is a chronological account
over twenty years (and there is an un-
helpful dearth of dates).
f|N all the ordinary normal criteria, it
emerges from this account that there
is a Mafia. It matters very much that
the simple fact should be established; for
there is of course a nearly total lack of
formal, “official” evidence; and one of
the best defences of the “honored soci-
ety” lies in its sophisticated supporters
pointing out how improbable the whole
notion is.
But unlikely and unlikeably enough,
the Mafia does seem to flourish in Sicily
(and through its own success to be the
only institution that does flourish in that
sick society), with vigorous extensions to
the mainland, to Rome, to the USA—
and elsewhere? Its effects on the life of
the community are enormous: according
to Mr Lewis, 400,000 people— one-tenth
of the population of the island —have
left it in the course of one decade alone,
in despair at the intractable harshness
and poverty of life in Sicily, whose
economic confusion is inextricably in-
volved with the existence and influence
of the Mafia.
What then is the Mafia? Institution-
ally it’s a secret society— secret in the
sense that it doesn’t publicly acknow-
ledge its own existence, that its whole
behavior and organisation are clande-
stine. How is it organised? In groups
known as “families”, whose heads
(capi di famiglie) keep up loose contacts
but have no strict pattern of subordina-
tion. How do you join it? By invita-
tion only—and then willy-nilly; Mr
Lewis quotes fascinating evidence from
a reluctant doctor who found himself
under Mafia patronage, to the rapid en-
richment of his practice and the loss of
any professional freedom.
The Mafia is not so much illegal as
anti-legal. It appears to have arisen as
a desperate defence against the corrupt
tyranny of the Bourbon kingdom of
Naples, the kind of Resistance by which
people could cow the local officials and
mitigate their operations. But it became
a self-perpetuating code of inverted
honor with its own corruptions a
primitively ideologised Robin Hood, set
up to rob the poor to help itself, and
doing deals with everyone from monar-
chists to Communists.
Its most remarkable phase in many
ways has been its post-war revival after
its near-extinction by Mussolini. There
is bizarre evidence which suggests that
it may have been used by the Allied
forces to assist in the liberation of the
island in 1943, since when it has
flourished more and more as a politically
useful adjunct of the Right, to the in-
evitable demoralisation of the local
society and the corruption of the poli-
ticians manipulating the process.
Its essential mores is loyalty to the
“honored society” and, finally, to nothing
else; the Church becomes a background
performance of strictly secondary force
—its teaching could never outweigh the
requirements of the Society. In this
context the Church's teaching becomes
merely a performance for the peasants,
the executive agencies of the State fail to
be exploited or perverted, and the rule
of law is an unheard-of novelty. A whole
anti - morality develops: the worst of
crimes in Mafia eyes is no f murder in
the name of honor of course, but the
concealment of the corpse so that the
ritual oath of vengeance in its presence
cannot be taken. Pathetically enough,
old-style Mafiosi with their Bronze-Age
rectitude deplore the vulgar and straight-
forward criminality of the newer,
Americanised Sicilian gangsterism which
its own attrition of a whole society has
allowed to flourish.

Society Novels
American Social Fiction: James to
Cozzens. Michael Millgate. Oliver &
Boyd. 355.
VT either Dr Millgate nor I know
exactly what “social fiction” is. Nor,
for that matter, does Arnold Kettle,
writing on nineteenth - century English
“social novelists” such as Disraeli and
Mrs Gaskell. But Kettle approaches the
problem more rigorously than does Dr
Millgate, by declaring that “strictly
speaking, all novels are social novels”.
In Kettle’s view, the distinction between
so-called “social novelists” and writers
like Dickens and George Eliot may be
“simply a matter of quality”; but he
adds that one of the limitations of
“social novelists” is their tendency to
see things too much in the abstract. Yet
with most “social novelists” the limiting
feature is, precisely, over-particularity,
failure to give to social reportage and
observation a universal significance.
Dr Millgate doesn't appear to be very
interested in formal considerations of
this kind. Where he does touch on
them, in his concluding chapter, the
argument is confused. On the one hand,
novelists such as Dos Passos and Mailer
are censured because they are “not so
much responding to the social fact as
trying to fit the social fact to their
particular social ‘idea’.” But this point
of view is not reconciled with the state-
ment, a few pages later, that “In the
last analysis, what we ask of the social
novelist is not so much that he should
reflect our view of society but that he
should make us see society his way”.
Unfortunately, confusion is not con-
fined to the concluding chapter; and
one has to resist the temptation to make
out a completely adverse case about
this book, based on the evidence of Dr
Millgate's recurrent and astonishing
amnesia about what he has said on
previous pages. I come (with large
qualifications) to praise the book, not to
bury it. But its frequent inconsistencies
must at least be noted here.
How well informed was Edith Whar-
ton about the world described in her
novels? Dr Millgate offers two incom-
patible answers. In a comparison with
James and Howells on p. 65 he says of
her that “She is more at home than ever
they were in greater and wider worlds.
She sees, worldly-wise, how things are
done”. But on p. 211 we are surprised
to hear that she was “not especially well
informed about the world of affairs”.
Dr Millgate is similarly liberal with
points of view about the relation between
Fitzgerald's “The Last Tycoon” and
“The Great Gatsby”:
Fitzgerald does not seem fully to have
realised that in “The Last Tycoon”
he faced a problem of construction
quite different from the one he had
so brilliantly solved in “The Great
Gatsby”; otherwise he would surely
not have tried to cast his new book
so completely in the same mould,
(p. 121.)
Completed, “The Last Tycoon”
would have been triumphant evidence
of Fitzgerald's ability to write a social
novel radically different from “The
Great Gatsby” in both aim and
method, (p. 127.)
Again, we are told (in all-too-familiar
Leavisian style) of the novels of Howells
that
to compare “The Rise of Silas Lap-
ham” (1885) and “A Hazard of New
Fortunes” (1890) is to chart with sur-
prising accuracy that decisive change
which took place in the American in-
tellectual climate around 1890 and
gave rise to the Progressive movement.
But a few pages later, Howells “seems
never to grasp the essential economic and
social facts of the situation nor even
the logical consequences of his own
position”, and “as a social statement
‘A Hazard of New Fortunes’ suffers a
certain blurring of the issues”.
A fter these “Fallings from us, vanish-
ings” of points of view in this study,
however, what remains to be praised is,
first of all, the isolation and moderately
accurate description of an interesting,
if minor, tradition of American novels
about businessmen and social institu-
tions; and the consequent illumination of
some of the more important members of
the tradition such as Wharton and Fitz-
gerald.
Looming large in the last chapters of
this book, evidently as a kind of Con-
fucian sage to be deferred to by younger
American aspirants to the title of Suc-
cessful Social Novelist, is the figure of
C. P. Snow. Some of the things which
Dr Millgate reports as samples of Con-
fucian wisdom 1 find too irritating to be
left untouched in this review:
Lewis Eliot speaks of the college as
“a society completely sure of itself,
completely certain of its values, com-
pletely without misgivings about whe-
ther it was living a good life”. Snow’s
academics do not exercise their minds
or consciences about whether or not
they are doing good; indeed, in “The
Light and the Dark” it is suggested
that “Good people don’t do good”.
This is not complacency—no one has
examined academic jealousy, hatred
and pettiness more rigorously than
Snow —but it is assurance.
So far from feeling the “assurance” in
these Snow-droppings, I find them ludi-
crously ponderous and unrealistic. Bland
navel-gazing.

Inside Africa
Forks and Hope. Elspeth Huxley.
Chatto and Windus. 38s. 6d.
'C'lspeth Huxley knows and loves
Africa. She brings to it a sensitive,
perceptive mind, an eye for detail, and
a generous supply of commonsense and
human understanding. These qualities
were evident in such deservedly popular
books as her earlier “The Flame Trees
of Thika” and “The Mottled Lizard”.
To these, “Forks and Hope”, although a
book of a rather different kind, is a
worthy successor. This “African note-
book” records a number of impressions
of the old Africa that is passing away,
and of the new Africa that is replacing
it, impressions which, if fragmentary,
nevertheless build up into a coherent
whole. The title suggests the connecting
thesis of the book: the great question is
what sort of Africa is going to emerge.
Now that the first excitement of
“Uhuru” is dying down, one gets the
feeling that many of the African leaders
are themselves in search of a distinc-
tively African society, with an African
Government, culture, way of life, with-
out knowing at all clearly what they
are looking for, and with the disquieting
possibility that the highly desirable Snark
may turn' out to be Boojurn, after all.
In recording her impressions of this
Africa as it emerges, Mrs Huxley seems
refreshingly free from prejudice. She
does not sentimentalise either the expa-
triate Europeans who used to control
Africa, or their African successors, but
sees the common strengths and weak-
nesses shared by both.' She can sympa-
thise with the displaced white settlers,


and recognise their heartbreak at leaving
a country they love, where they have
built up their beautiful farms from no-
thing, without endorsing the system
which allowed them to be there. It has
become unpopular to talk of what the
white man has put into Africa, and
rightly so, if this is advanced as any sort
of justification for what he has got out
of it, but this book, without for a
moment defending the exploitation of
colonialism, shows the sadness of the
waste of human effort, in, say, the split-
ting up of the farms in the White High-
lands for African settlement. Through no
fault of their own, the Africans have
neither the capital nor the experience
to keep the farms going; these have to
run down, and their productivity, so
badly needed in a country that has so
much to do, is almost entirely lost.
“Africanisation” presents many pro-
blems, not the least of them being the
need to retain the services of skilled
white administrators and technicians un-
til Africans can be trained to take their
places. Nobody knowing anything of the
history of colonial Africa can be sur-
prised by the strength of the Africans’
desire to run things for themselves; at
the same time, one cannot blame the
expatriate, who knows that he will be
replaced as soon as possible, for looking
elsewhere for a permanent position at
once, rather than waiting for dismissal.
This leaves a gap that must be bridged
somehow, perhaps through help of the
kind that Britain and America are al-
ready offering, with personnel on two-
year contracts. How successfully or un-
successfully the transition is being made
is an issue that concerns a good deal of
the book.
There are so many problems to be
faced, political, social and economic;
African leaders themselves are well
aware of their own inexperience, and of
the enormity of their task. What kind of
democracy, for instance, can be made to
work in tribal Africa? Is Julius Nyerere
right in insisting on the one-party state,
or will East Africa degenerate into a
near - dictatorship, like Nkrumah’s
Ghana? Mrs Huxley neatly points up the
danger when she says that African
leaders, so long accustomed to being
called agitators and treated as criminals,
find it very difficult to imagine or
allow a situation in which they would
willingly hand over their political power
to anyone else. At the same time, she
finds so much that is admirable, so strong
a sense of responsibility in many of the
leaders, such an enthusiasm and latent
power in the people themselves, that it
it impossible for the reader not to hope
and even believe that ways will be found
to solve the difficulties.
Something of great value is being
created, but, in the process, things of
value are also being destroyed. Some of
the most moving passages in the book
deal with the wildlife and with the
countryside itself, too often the inadver-
tant casualties of the struggle for free-
dom. Unfortunately the justice of the
claim of people to own their own
country is no guarantee of their ability to
look after it properly, and by the time
they learn, it may be too late to save
many beautiful things. Mrs Huxley has
faith in people; she believes that they will
sort out their problems, but because she
sees Africa with a lover’s eye, she fears
for what may be lost in the meantime.
The book is charmingly illustrated by
Jonathan Kingdon.

son. 225. 6d.
Massacre. Robert Lait. Muller. 275.
6d.
Tillie Olsen is apparently a new
A writer, and to judge from her first
collection of short stories, a remarkably
gifted and very original one of whom
much may be expected. Each of the four
sketches in “Tell Me a Riddle” takes as
its theme an unusual aspect of life in
America. Each is a microcosm of the
thoughts and emotions of some different,
alien, perhaps even unsuspected world
told with the utmost economy of langu-
age.
The title story is a sensitive study of
the last weeks of an old Russian emigree
who is dying of cancer. It avoids all the
traps: it is neither maudlin, sentimental
nor nauseating, but it is full of com-
passion. For those who like to know what
happens in a story, the answer is, nothing
... it is an account of the concluding
steps in a dance of death with the ulti-
mate finale never in doubt.
As she is dying, the old woman looks
back over her life and asks herself what
it has all added up to: little disconnected
pieces emerge and form a pattern: a
village wedding, an old folksong, books
she did not have time to read, candles in
a ritual, her childhood, poverty, political
prison, the bearing of seven babies to a
husband who did little but “pour
vinegar” on her daily and demand
“honey” in return. It seems to her now
to have been all for nothing, senseless,
without reason, without purpose.
No one tells her she is dying. The
woman leaves them with their fancied
secret. During her life, she has always
had to move to the rhythm of others
and even when approaching death she
is denied her own pace. When all she
wants is to remain peacefully at home,
her husband rushes her about the
country on brief farewell visits to the
various cramped quarters of their mar-
ried children. She dies before the pro-
mised return, her husband realizing too
late the full depths of his feeling.
The story owes much to what could,
at times, almost be called a telegram
style, but a telegram despatched in a
slight Russian accent, obtained by twist-
ing syntax and omitting the article. “Tell
Me a Riddle” is the longest and most im-
pressive of the four sketches and won
Tillie Olsen the O. Henry Award for
the best short story. But the other three
are also very moving: “I Stand Here
Ironing” which reveals the thoughts of
a down-trodden working mother who
fears she has failed her daughter; “Hey,
Sailor, What Ship?” which is about an
old seaman on leave; and “O Yes” in
which a white schoolgirl is forced at the
same time both to identify herself with
and to betray her Negress friend.
“The Goose Girl” is supposed to be a
novel about homosexuals but I am not
quite convinced that it is. Briefly, it
centres on Roger, an accountant by pro-
fession and thoroughly jealous, discon-
tented and unpleasant in character. Roger
meets a girl and fears that she may fall
in love with him, so he warns her at once
that he and the two students, Lewis and
Petey with whom he shares his London
flat are, to use his own words, “queer”.
Rather unconvincingly, the girl
Audrey then finds herself devoting her
spare time to this flock, cooking, cleaning
and mothering. When Petey leaves to
join the RAF, Roger makes unsuccess-
ful passes at Lewis, instead. Again, some-
what improbably, Lewis brings home Sid,
whom he knows to be heterosexual, to
share the flat, whereon Sid and Audrey
fall in love, although Roger almost suc-
ceeds in breaking things up by telling the
girl that Sid is one of them. Lewis gets
friendly with Tim who, we are told, is
a “professional”. When Sid and Audrey
decide to marry, Roger, in a panic at
being left alone, makes a half-hearted
attempt at suicide, but more to gain sym-
pathy than death. He persuades the
couple to let him come and live with
them, but, at the last moment, finds he
can stand on his own feet after all.
Miss Gilbert reminds us often that
Roger, Petey, Lewis and Tim are all
homosexuals, but I could not shake off
the suspicion that if it had suited her
plot, she could just as easily have label-
led them heterosexual bachelors, Yeti or
well-conceived robots, with as much or
as little evidence or persuasion.
A novel on such a subject must be
told with tremendous insight and under-
standing. It is not enough to make the
two heterosexuals all sweetness and light

These qualities are common human
characteristics, divided among all sexes
and their variants. It might be argued
that few novels which go seriously into
the matter can get past the censor. This
one will not even raise an eyebrow.
For anyone who can stand the gore,
“Massacre” is one of those “outpost of
journalism” novels, a sort of fictional
documentary. A horribly persuasive re-
port of what can happen in an African
country after the sun has set on the
last of the bumptious white administra-
tors, it relies on over-simplification: the
goodies are all painted very white, the
baddies very black and the blood pure
Technicolor. In a struggle for power,
the Africans turn on the local Indians,
on the white lawyer who had helped to
give them independence and on each
other. Only the hero survives till the end.

Notes From a Bottle Found on
Beach at Carmel. Evan S. Connell
Jnr. William Heinemann. 31s.
IiyHEN is a poem a long poem? 243
" pages of prose-poetry should mean
something, and where this book is con-
cerned they mean an incredible ramble
through a junk-yard of ideas, places and
people.
Evan S. Connell Jr has managed to in-
clude nearly everything in this diffuse
and hotchpotch book. Its pages feature
Jesus Christ, Albrecht Diirer, the Duke
of Anjou, the explorers of Vineland,
World War 11, Hiroshima, Emperor
Charles V, druidic priests, the plague,
cholera, Mankind, Hans Holbein, Florida
Keys, Hell, Antichrist, and countless
other ingredients, propelled perhaps by a
desire on the author's part to write an
epic comparable to Pound’s Cantos.
“Notes From a Bottle” was originally
published in “Contact”, a San Francisco
magazine, and Kenneth Lamott said that
Connell's work “eludes the usual cate-
gories of literature, falling somewhere
in that dimly defined but extraordinary
fertile area where prose and verse, fic-
tion and non-fiction, metaphysics and
science meet'’. However, what really
eludes is form and balance. It is full of
modernistic tricks, and it seems that the
author believes that “free association” is
the basis of poetry, and that the way to
write a poem is to be as relaxed as
possible and let the ideas come freely into
the mind: the result is not variety but
monotony, a lack of subtlety, and raw-
ness.

Search for
Freedom
We Are Going. Poems. Kath Walker.
Jacaranda Press. 13s. 6d.
Tames Devaney says in his foreword:
** “As far as I know this is the first
book of poems to be published by an
Australian Aborigine.” After all, women
in the audience wept when Harold Blair
made his debut as a singer . . .
Other Australian poets, raking the
cupboards of our affluent society for a
skeleton to rattle, may well envy Mrs
Walker for having something to moan
about, but at the same time they must
admit she does it well:
We want hope, not racialism,
Brotherhood, not ostracism,
Black advance, not white ascendance:
Make us equals, not dependants.
We need help, not exploitation,
We want freedom, not frustration;
Not control, but self-reliance,
Independence, not compliance . . .
She keeps this up, down one page and
over into the next, in a way not many
other Australian practitioners could
equal.
She also reminds us of Uncle Wil-
liam’s dark humor:
White fellow, you are the unhappy
race.
You alone have left nature and made
civilised laws.
You have enslaved yourselves as you
enslaved the horse and other wild
things.
Why, white man?
Your police lock up your tribe in
houses with bars,
We see poor women scrubbing floors
of richer women.
Why, white man, why?
Having, in her other poems, demand-
ed that the Aboriginals be taken into the
white man’s civilisation, Mrs Walker ends
this poem:
Leave us alone, we don't want your
collars and ties,
We don’t need your routines and com-
pulsions.
We want the old freedom and joy that
all things have but you,
Poor white man of the unhappy race.
This merely means that Mrs Walker
is both a woman and a poet, intent not
so much on what she says as where she
is going. Those of us who have spent
so much time learning an art which
does not go anywhere but is practised
for its own sake can only watch with
awe her primitive progression, and hope
she gets somewhere.
RONALD McCUAIG
Today and Yesterday
THE FIRST AUSTRALIAN BUDGET
npHE honor of presenting the first
A budget to an Australian legislature
fell to Governor Sir Richard Bourke
on September 27, 1832. On the
previous March 16 the first appropri-
ation Bill had been passed, one of the
items being £6,400 to bring out
female farm servants from England
at the rate of £8 a head. And now,
in accordance with a despatch which
he had just received, the Governor
announced that it was the King’s
desire that before the expiration of
June in each year estimates should
be submitted to the Legislative Coun-
cil and passed as an Ordinance to be
sent to England for approval.
The Governor then read a minute
“explanatory of the several heads of
expenditure and Ways and Means, as
estimated for the Year 1833” —in
other words, the first Budget Speech.
He proposed to raise £119,515 ss. Bd.
and spend £110,252 7s. 9d. pro-
viding a surplus of £9,262 17s. lid.,
which he expected to be enough “to
cover apy failure of revenue or un-
looked for expense” during the year.
When the Estimates were brought
down the first week in October, they
were passed. It was a boom time
and at the end of the year Sir Richard
was able to note progress with a satis-
faction worthy of Mr Harold Holt.
The improving state of the revenues
was noted with satisfaction. The
Customs duties had reached an all
time peak. Buildings were “rising
rapidly in Sydney and other towns;
in many branches of agriculture the
rate of profit had advanced and
capital, prudently invested, obtained
a return here unknown in other
countries”, a fact which “would not
long escape the attention of wealthy
capitalists in Europe”. The great
roads being built by Sir Thomas
Mitchell were being laid down “upon
principles such as to admit the future
application of steam whenever the
contemplated improvements in that
impelling power, and the increased
wealth and intercourse of the country,
should render such a mode of inland
carriage available”. The total receipts
of Consolidated Revenue for the year
actually exceeded the estimate by no
less than £19,000 which was just as
well, since, setting the pace for all
future Governments, the New South
Wales autocracy had spent £ 16,000-
odd more than it budgeted for. As
ever, it was triumphant about its per-
formance.
It was, in fact, the normal Aus-
tralia, for only two or three years
before the whole country had been
emerging from a drought and was so
far bankrupt that everybody was
watching John Macarthur because it
was being said that if he went down
financially, the whole place must go
to pieces. But pessimism overnight
had given way to optimism. Sydney
was going in for a water supply
tunnel. Major Mitchell was sharpen-
ing his spurs for further explorations.
The Australian Agricultural Company
was applying steam to its coal haulage
in Newcastle, and Captain Biddulph
had arrived during the year with the
first steamer, the little Isle of Man
packet Sophia Jane, which was in
future years to set the balladists of the
Hunter River singing:
We had no steam in Maitland then,
, And none did we desire
Till Biddulph out from England
came
And brought us the “Sophia”.
In 1833 the population of the
mainland was 53,000-odd including
a couple of thousand transient soldiery
and 24,000 convicts. There was less
than 57,000 acres under cultivation
and the continent's exports were
worth £384,000 and the imports over
£600,000. For all practical purposes,
Australia (apart from Van Diemen’s
Land) consisted of a wild area
bounded by the Murrumbidgee in the
South, the Hunter River District on
the North and Wellington on the
West, with outlying convict settle-
ments along the coast as far north as
Moreton Bay.
Who could have forecast that with-
in a single lifetime of three score
years and ten a Federal Treasurer
would be bringing down a first Com-
monwealth Budget for a Consolidated
Revenue of £ll millions, nearly all
found from Customs, Excise and
Postal sources, apart from roughly
£26 millions collected by the six
States? Who could have estimated
that in less than another lifetime,
the Federal and State Governments
of Australia would be spending over
£3i billions a year on government—
an amount as great as the whole of
the national debts of all the nations
of the world in 1870, less than a
century ago?
M. H. ELLIS


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Companies Face Tax-cost Hurdles
IT was expected that the Federal Government in its August
11 Budget would seek extra revenue at the retail source,
such as excise on cigarettes (an additional 3d. or 4d. per
packet of 20 cigarettes) and a lift in automobile sales tax from
221 p.c. to 25 p.c. But the increase in company tax from Bs. to
Bs. 6d. for a public company is a direct slug that could have
greater implications than generally realised.
The Treasurer himself anticipates that this 6d. in the £1
company tax will raise an additional £22 million in revenue
in a full year. That’s £22 million that can’t be ploughed back
into industry. Disregarding the normal concession of £250
on the first £5,000 of taxable income, the general public
company tax rate goes up from 40 p.c. to 421 p.c. A small
enough rise, it seems, yet it is equal to an increase of 61 p.c.
In other words, a 6d. increase
on Bs. is 6i p.c. It doesn’t
sound so much if a company
earning £lO,OOO profit now
shows a net profit of only
£5,500 compared with £5,750
previously. However, it is still
a drop of more than 4} p.c.
and is imposed in a year when
wage costs have been influenced
by the £1 Federal basic wage
increase in luly.
True, the Budget is designed
to contain the incipient threat
of inflation and, in this regard,
companies may find less com-
petition for labor and materials.
Rising imports, though, apart
from combating inflation, will
create greater competition for
the locals at a time when they
are being asked to shoulder in-
creased tax and wage burdens.
The increased competition from
imports also will tend to prevent
the easy solution of charging
the consumer a higher price for
locally manufactured goods.
Because of this, The Bulletin reiterates what it has been
plugging in recent months. Investors should assess a company’s
shares on profit performance rather than on airy-fairy growth
forecasts.
Encouraging Report on Ord
Cotton - Growers
lj\)UR out of the five pioneer cotton-growers on the Qrd River
(WA) project earned profits from their first cash crops.
These profits remain after due allowances are made for depre-
ciation and interest on the capital investment involved.
Raw Cotton Imports and Production
The apparent success of cotton growing on the Ord River
project may have significant implications for cotton areas
elsewhere in Australia and is discussed in an article on this
page. Imports of raw cotton at present far exceed domestic
production, as the graph above illustrates.
The result doubtless brings some relief to the Western Aus-
tralian Government, which has stood up to a considerable
barrage on the general economics of the whole ambitious
Ord scheme. Not the least of this criticism comes from the
Institute of Agriculture at the WA University.
It is hardly likely that the attacks will stop, for the details
of the success with cotton derive from a favorable survey
produced by WA’s own Department of Agriculture. The
Government dearly needed a good report to put before
Federal authorities, who are about to examine the financing
of the Greater Ord dam, the scheme's second stage.
Whatever the wider conclusions, though, it does look diffi-
cult to gainsay the promise for cotton. The prospects, too,
give particular significance to attempts to expand Australia's
domestic production of raw
cotton in other areas, notably in
the Murrumbidgee Irrigation
Area.
At Kununurra (on the Ord),
the five farms, spreading over
1359 acres, yielded 608,914 lb.
of cotton worth £125,933.
Ginning and marketing costs
took £25,916 from that amount.
Labor and suchlike costs are
also to be deducted from the
individual farmers’ cash surplus.
The accompanying graph,
setting imports against domestic
output, shows that Australia has
a vast leeway to catch up before
reaching anything like self-
sufficiency. Important as cotton
may become among local crops
in the future, not much of a
dent can be made just yet on
the present import bill totalling
about £6 million.
Nevertheless, extension of the
newer Ord and MIA develop-
ments is well under way, to supplement the predominantly
Queensland source of Australia's crop. Before 1963, there
were only two cotton gins in Australia, both owned by the
Queensland Cotton Marketing Board. Now there are six,
operated by five different grower organisations.
Australian spinners are only able to get 10 p.c. of their
raw cotton requirements from domestic growers, encouraged
as these may be by a Commonwealth bounty. The spinners
have to take all suitable local cotton before they are allowed
duty-free import of the rest of their needs.
Perhaps the best message from the Ord was that costs were
well below anticipation and that almost 70 p.c. of cotton
produced was at premium grade.


Thunder from the Synthetic
Fibre Manufacturers
"Doth sides in the great wool debate should take time out
-*-* to study the address given by the managing director of
Fibremakers Ltd, Mr Norman G. Wilson, at the first conven-
tion of the Federated Garment Industries of Australia.
Mr Wilson spoke comprehensively, and confidently, on “The
Role of Synthetic Fibres in the Textile and Garment Indus-
tries”.
Well might he exude optimism, for he came before the
convention as spokesman for the world's synthetic fibre pro-
ducers, who have increased their output by nearly 1900 p.c.
in the last 14 years and reached an output of about 3000
million lb. in 1963.
Actual world usage has grown by about 25 p.c. a year
since 1958. Significantly, Mr Wilson was able to add: “It
is worth commenting in passing that in Australia the growth
rate has been at least comparable with that occurring the
world over, indicating that synthetic fibres are ideally suited
to Australian requirements.”
As the International Wool Secretariat goes happily about
promoting the separate virtues of wool, it might like to pay
some attention to Mr Wilson’s remarks on blended fabrics.
“Firstly, there is the whole field of Terylene-wool, Terylene-
cotton, and Terylene-flax blends which offer a wide range
of fabric weights suited to Australia’s wide range of climatic
conditions,” he began.
Then Mr Wilson quoted from Dr Eric Kahn, director of
Marks and Spencer, London: “There is no longer any oppo-
sition from the traditional cotton and wool industries to the
handling and use of synthetic fibres. The possibilities of
fabricating new types of textiles and new blends revealed by
the vast amount of research and development have made the
traditional spinners, knitters, weavers and finishers realise the
potential offered by the blending of natural with synthetic
fibres . . . (which) can compensate for the inadequacies of each
component.”
Mr Wilson made it plain that synthetic fibres and natural
fibres must together meet the world’s explosive clothing de-
mand—“synthetic fibres are not a substitute for anything”.
He put a case clearly for partnership between all fibre pro-
ducers, textile manufacturers and garment manufacturers.
All parties naturally have their own axes to grind in the
reserve-price discussions. Synthetics speak, however, from a
dramatically rising market position and wool from what the
London “Economist” calls an “increasingly beleaguered” citadel.
Less Sweetness in
Sugar Markets
Ougar found its way into the news last week with reports that
Australia had sold 40,000 tons of raw sugar to Malaysia’s
first sugar refinery at Prai (operated by the Malayan Sugar
Manufacturing Co.); that Massey Ferguson had developed an
automatic cane planting and cane harvesting machine, and
also that the European beet production may exceed 23 million
tons in the coming season.
Sugar speculators were not too happy about the suggestion
that Europe’s beet production might be four million tons above
the 1963-64 level, including Soviet production of about nine
million tons. As a result, sugar prices eased to £stg4l a ton
and are now a long way below last year’s boom prices of
around £stgloo a ton.
The inevitable conclusion is that a boom in commodity
prices invariably stimulates higher production, attracts specu-
lators, encourages the sale of stockpiled stocks and, worst of
all, invites the use of substitutes.
Although beet sugar production represents about 40 p.c.
of total world output, it is grown in Europe mainly for con-
sumption rather than for export. Any increase in beet pro-
duction therefore tends to reduce the prospects for cane sugar
exports and increases the pressure from beet growers to gain
additional export quotas to countries which normally buy
cane sugar.
Although cane producers are bemoaning the fall in prices,
they can at least gain some consolation from the fact that
there is greater stabilisation for the industry at the lower
price level, which reduces the risk of losing markets per-
manently to the beet producers.
Looking for Alternative
Tin Producers
booming world price level for tin metal may have
"*■ focused the spotlight on Australian marginal producers,
but proved Malayan performers are being restricted to the
regular chorus line. Threats of war, with a consequent inter-
ruption of activities, are the reason for this conservative
attitude, because lessons of the last war are still remembered.
The more recent experiences of guerrilla warfare in the
Malayan jungles are reminders of the problems facing the
tin producers in that area. In fact, one of the reasons for high
tin prices is the prospective threat to Malayan supplies.
Any extension of the Vietnam war or a further step in the
confrontation campaign could cause a difficult situation for
tin producers. Many people who live in the area are resigned
to the political tensions of recent years and point to the fact
that the tin producers in Malaya are still earning good money
and paying good dividends. It is hard, however, to encourage
new risk capital into the area.
A more definite restriction on optimism in Malaya is the
influence of the US stockpiling authority, General Services
Administration, whose job is to release stockpiled tin onto
the open market if prices go too high. This regulation of
prices has kept speculators within bounds, but observers are
saying that the GSA release programme would be limited to
a release of 20,000 tons per annum for about seven or eight
years, by which time the stockpile would be exhausted.
This doesn’t allow for a fall in prices, of course, which
would permit GSA to buy again. The current shortage of tin
metal is encouraging suggestions that tin prices are unlikely
to fall below £stglooo sterling a ton in the near future. The
spot price in London was £stgl273 last week.
The UK has taken a look at alternative tin producing areas
and Consolidated Gold Fields recently gained an interest in
the Renison mine, Tasmania, when it bought a minimum 25
p.c. interest in Mount Lyell which, in turn, owns a 50 p.c.
share of Renison. This may have prompted the London
“Financial Times” to refer to recent efforts in Australia by
the Aberfoyle group, with its interests in Greenbushes, WA,
Mt Cleveland, Tasmania, and Ardlethan, NSW.
If production schedules are fulfilled, Greenbushes may
produce 300 tons by the end of 1964, Mt Cleveland may be
in production by 1966 and Ardlethan may be producing at
the rate of 600 tons per annum when it gets into production
later this year. This all takes time and money, however, and
tin prices will need to be sustained for several years before
the benefits accrue. The long-term outlook does envisage the
need to provide alternative supplies outside Malaya.

Problems of Regional Growth
Mineral discoveries and the outlying areas
T>ecent newspaper supplements don’t
help one to be humble about Aust-
ralia’s economic development. It is not
that the record of development in the
eastern States or in general national
terms is unworthy of the glamor treat-
ment given in these supplements. But
flying over the vast uninhabited spaces
of the north and west of the continent,
one is stuck with the old thought that we
have a long way to go before the picture
could be fully satisfying in terms of
either territory or population. Our metro-
politan and, in its confined spaces, rural
expansion since the war has been as im-
pressive as anywhere in the world. The
rich areas have become richer, fuller.
One has to admit, though, that this has
been to the neglect of the outlying areas
of the continent.
Yet a new pattern of development
could be in the making in Australia as
a result of the important mineral dis-
coveries of the last few years. True,
minerals have never been out of the
development picture here, and have, at
various times, led it. Since the war, how-
ever, the emphasis has been more on
secondary industry expansion in metro-
politan areas than on the exploitation of
new mineral discoveries. Only in the last
five years or so have new mineral
developments again swum to the fore-
front of the picture so much so that
the emerging future pattern is one of
a much stronger minerals weave on a
strongly expanding industrial backcloth.
r|NE cannot see mineral development
radically altering the distribution of
population to give a much thicker con-
tent of people to the outlying areas,
where most of the new mineral dis-
coveries have been made. It is more
that this development will provide new
sinews to strengthen the economy as
a whole, a wider and more solid base
for industry in the metropolitan areas
and a big supplement to our overseas
income from metals and metal products.
Just as we have had to accept the fact
that expansion of rural production has
failed to put more people into the
country areas, so we must reconcile our-
selves to the hard truth that the ex-
ploitation of new mineral discoveries
will not necessarily mean the growth of
big concentrations of people.
Even so, there is a very real area
of conflict to be resolved between
regional and national growth. Some
aspects of this have been brought out
by C. P. Harris in the latest issue of
“Growth”, published by CEDA, when
talking about “the differences between
the economic growth of a nation and
the regions which together comprise that
nation.”
“Briefly,” says Harris, “these differ-
ences can be summed up by saying that
if in a given nation some type of econo-
mic growth project is introduced, then
so long as the benefits of this accrue to
the residents of that nation, the country
experiences growth. However, if the
project is applied in a particular region
but the main benefits accrue to inhabi-
tants of another region in the same
country, then although the nation has
grown, there is an important difference
between the economic stimulus to growth
in each of the two regions.”
HTo take an example from Queensland,
A about which Harris is writing. If the
Weipa bauxite deposits are treated at
Gladstone, then most of the stimulus to
economic growth arising from the de-
velopment of those bauxite deposits will
arise in central Queensland and not
northern Queensland, because it is the
treatment and refining of the ore, not
its mining, which requires the greatest
investment in plant and machinery, the
bulk of the increase in the work force
and the development of fuel and trans-
port. Again, when copper concentrates
from Mount Isa were shipped to Port
Kembla and refined there, NSW obtained
the major benefit. Now that Isa’s copper
concentrates are refined at Townsville,
the economic stimulus is shifted there.
Thus, Harris thinks that “in studying
problems of the economic growth of
regions, and in drawing up plans to in-
stitute such growth, great care is re-
quired in order that the geographical
pattern of benefits is correctly forecast,
otherwise the regional growth stimulus
may be disappointingly small in certain
cases. What is required is a knowledge
of the differences among industries in
regard to their local as compared with
their national benefits, for if these differ-
ences are great they are important fac-
tors to be considered in drawing up
regional growth plans—in the first in-
stance it may be necessary to concentrate
on projects whose local benefits are the
greatest, even if they are not the most
grandiose of the projects available.”
Considered in relation to regional
growth possibilities in Western Austra-
lia the approach may, however, have to
be rather different from that in Queens-
land because of the less hospitable terrain
in the West. Here one recently found
people using extravagant epithets about
the possibilities for diffused population
growth they see arising from the exploi-
tation of the important mineral dis-
coveries made in the State in recent
years. Maybe some of these epithets will
be made good from the big southern
mineral deposits. Indeed, a lot of pro-
gress has been made already in popula-
tion thickening—at Kwinana, for in-
stance, where Alcoa’s alumina refinery
has sprung up almost overnight on the
basis of the bauxite deposits less than
30 miles away. Again, mineral sands
developments further south have been
drawing in more people to thinly popu-
lated areas.
/\nce out of the temperate regions
into the Pilbara, say, the problems
become quite different. One has lately
been looking at some of this more north-
ern territory, where the horizons for new
mineral development have been brought
so much closer in the last few years with
the discovery of a hitherto unsuspected
15,000 million tons of high grade iron
ore deposits in a vast area inland from
Port Hedland and where there are
exciting prospects of new sources of
power, maybe from oil and gas stem-
ming from the possibilities recently re-
vealed at Barrow Island and also from
the harnessing of tidal power off the
coast of the Kimberleys.
Many development plots have been
laid up there by some of the biggest
companies in the mining world and
nearly all with strong international con-
nections. To name a few which have
staked out big claims in the Pilbara iron
ore fields, the main groups include such
giant concerns as CRA, Kaiser, Consoli-
dated Goldfields, Cyprus Mines, Utah,
American Climax and CSR. Though
little has been done in physical develop-
ment of the claims as yet, it is only a
matter of time and line-ups for export
markets before the big machinery will
be moving in to claw out the ore. Yet
one cannot envisage a host of settlers
coming to this parched area, which is
awe-inspiring in its remoteness from
civilisation and is yet crying out to
achieve a link with it.

Farmers Using More Tractors
Greater power , new refinements for men on the land
rpHE workhorse of Australian agricul-
ture, the tractor, is in short, supply
due to favorable economic conditions
and good growing seasons, say manu-
facturers.
For these reasons, both local manu-
facture and imports have been rising
over the last 12 months. Figures from
the Commonwealth Statistician show that
for the 12 months ended June 30 Aus-
tralia imported tractors and parts to the
tune of £37 million, compared with the
previous year's total of £22,442,000, a
rise of more than 68 p.c.
Local manufacture also is on the up-
swing, though figures on production are
not available.
The tractor industry is a highly com-
petitive one, with suppliers having to
compete not only on the merits of their
respective products, but also on after-
sales service, availability of spare parts,
and resale value. There are only two
companies who produce tractors in Aus-
tralia, the International Harvester Com-
pany of Australia and Chamberlain In-
dustries. Other tractors are fully im-
ported, with, in some cases, a small per-
centage of Australian content.
An executive of International Har-
vester said his company could not meet
the current demand for tractors despite
the fact that factories in Victoria had
been working three shifts a day, seven
days a week, for eight or nine months.
“Several factors have caused this in-
in production,” the executive
said. “The good seasons farmers have
been having lately, apart from improving
crops, have put more money in their
pockets, thus enabling them to buy new
tractors. The cotton development at
Wee Waa, near Narrabri (NSW), has
meant large sales of tractors and cotton
pickers.”
International Harvester started the
manufacture of farm implements in 1937
and in 1948 the first Australian-made
McCormick International tractor came
out. International now manufactures
three basic tractors, a 40 horsepower,
and two 50 h.p. models, one suitable for
row-crop farming. It also makes imple-
ments to fit these tractors.
The executive said that International
tractors were “up to 80 p.c. Australian
content”. Foreign content is mainly
engine parts, which cannot be made here
because of high tooling costs. However,
“if the industry continues to grow at its
present rate the time will come when
we will be producing the engine entirely
in Australia”.
The Federal Government offers an in-
centive, in the form of a bounty, to
encourage higher Australian content in
tractors. The full bounty is payable on
tractors with 90 p.c. or more local con-
tent and ranges from £269 on a 20 belt
pulley horsepower model to £389 on an
80 b.p.h.p. model. For each one p.c. of
Australian content by which the content
is less than 90 p.c., the bounty is reduced
by 1.5 p.c. No bounty is paid on trac-
tors with less than 55 p.c. local content.
It is hard to get a definite figure on
Australian content from the tractor
manufacturers as it varies widely accord-
ing to supply of parts. In some cases
where parts are in short supply locally
the manufacturer may use an imported
part.
tractor industry’s main problem,
said the International Harvester
executive, was the weather. “The industry
depends entirely on rain and as we have
to order and plan production at least 18
months ahead it is a gamble on whether
the weather at that time will fit in with
the sales we have planned. We are
planning for something that is completely
unpredictable. Seasons like this one we
are short of tractors, bad seasons leave
us with a surplus. Planning is also
affected tremendously by the availability
of certain types of steel.
The usage of International tractors in
order of importance is cereal farming,
mixed farming, orchard work and cot-
ton, said the executive. But Interna-
tional feels that more emphasis will be
placed on the tractors used in cotton
growing in the years to come. “Cotton
is going to be a tremendous industry in
NSW and I think the time is not too far
off when we will be producing all but
a very small percentage of our require-
ments. Cotton picking requires a large
number of machines as they are capable
of handling only a relatively small acre-
age on their own. A single-row picker
can handle about 150 to 180 acres and
a double-row (which costs about
£12,000) about 300 to 350 acres. The
cotton pickers we sell are fully imported
and we probably will never make them
in Australia in their entirety.”
An important factor in the develop-
ment of the tractor industry has been
the development of hydraulic mecha-
nisms. The International executive said
that although hydraulics have been used
in Australia for the past 14 years it was
only in the last five years that their
value in agriculture had been realised.
“Today we are selling more than 100 p.c.
hydraulic systems to tractors because
men on the land are converting their
older models to take hydraulics.
“Since the advent of hydraulics manu-
facturers are gradually swinging away
from the old handle or lever operated
implements and replacing them with
hydraulics.
“Service is an important part of trac-
tor sales. We like to think that we were
founded on our service. In NSW, for
instance, there are in excess of 400
dealers who carry an inventory of parts
suitable for every particular area. In
Sydney, the spare parts division occupies
23,000 square feet and our store at Gun-
nedah 2500 square feet. They would
be carrying approximately £i million
worth of parts,” the executive added.
The need for greater mechanisation
in agriculture has caused the boom in
tractor sales, Mr L. Lazarides, branch
manager of sales and assembly opera-
tions of the Ford Motor Company’s
tractor division in NSW, says.
This, in conjunction with the higher
rates of depreciation farmers are allowed
on tractors, has helped push tractor sales
to their present high level. “Farmers
in Australia are increasing their acreages
and opening up new land and all these
activities mean better tractor sales. They
have more cash available, too, because of
the good prices both here and overseas
for our primary produce.”
Mr Lazarides said that apart from
bigger acreages, heavier tractor use had
necessitated increased power. “Our
share of sales in the over 55 h.p. group
has increased from 5 p.c. to 11 p.c.
because the Australian farmer works his
tractor a lot harder than his English or
American counterpart does. The Aus-
tralian farmer is probably the most de-
manding in the world and expects his
tractor to work as long and as hard as
he can.”
'C'ord’s tractors are imported mainly
from the UK, with a small number
coming from the US. They are
assembled here and modified for Aus-
tralian use.
The other Australian manufacturer,
Chamberlain Industries produces only
in Western Australia, with WA and
NSW taking the bulk of production. The


tractors are transported to the eastern
States by truck, the journey taking be-
tween five and seven days.
_ c . . „ „ r r L,m

farmers deman e a igger
tractor than overseas farmers used The
Australian farmer has bigger holdings
on which to use the stronger tractor and
larger implements. Our 62 horsepower
tractor has given Chamberlain its name
in Australian agriculture.
“An increasing lack of available labor
An increasing lack or a\aiiaoie ao
has caused a big demand for more
nnwprf.,l tractors with the farmer want-
f ng to handle bigger acreages with the
same number of people. Less hazardous
farming with drought resisting strains of
wheat and so on, has meant that the
farmer can afford the larger machines.
The use of bigger tractors is
also due to the fact that the
industry is providing them.”
Mr Lund confirmed the swing
to higher powered tractors with
figures. “In 1961-62, 2320 trac-
tors in the 40 to 55 h.p. class
were sold while 284 over 55
h.p. were sold. In 1962-63 it
was 2465 against 443 and in
the first nine months of 1963-
64 it was 2100 compared with
602 in the class over 55 h.p.”
The demand for tractors at
present was “fantastic”. “As
with most of the companies in
the tractor industry we have
been short over the last 12 to
18 months. We have a little
breathing space at the moment,
with demand tapering off be-
cause farmers have their crops
in and are not doing anything until they
get the September rains. Until they get
the rain and see how much money they
are going to make, they are keeping
their purses closed.
“But with the sound economy and a
high level of buoyancy, demand has
exceeded all expectations. There are
many points which have led to the buoy-
ancy in rural areas —we have been
assured of selling our wheat crop and
not having any surplus and other pri-
mary produce is selling at good prices.
Also farming today is a lot safer than
it was a few years ago, with drought-
resistant wheat which gives the farmer
courage to plant even though the weather
may not be 100 p.c. in his favor.
“Cotton has not yet affected our sales
because our equipment up to now has
been designed for broad-acre farming.
But equipment coming from the produc-
tion line this year will be ideally suited
to cotton. We have been battling to meet
the demand for our current markets
without exploring new fields.”
Apart from rural uses, the tractor is
also used in industry, although not all in
the tractor industry place great emphasis
on this field. Chamberlain, for instance,
last year supplied 21.5 p.c. of its pro-
duction to industry, 2.8 p.c. for export
and the balance (75.7 p.c.) for agricul-
tural purposes. Mr Lund said his com-
pany’s production of industrial tractors
each a§ wa§ t>
5 6/
“There is a big demand for export
but we can’t take full advantage of it at
the moment because of the tremendous
local demand which must be satisfied
first. The Far East and South America
. t 1 * w b p
are our main export outlets. We have
dealers in these areas who are ready to
be operative on a large scale as soon as
we want them to. They’re clamoring for
tractors at the moment, though we are
having to soft-pedal exports until we
can satisfy the home market.”
The British Motor Corporation,
through its Nuffield subsidiary, sells im-
ported tractors which come from the
English parent company’s tractor factory
at Bathgate in Scotland. An executive
of the tractor division said the two
models they sell, the 460 and the 342,
are about 47 p.c. Australian content,
comprising batteries, tyres and some
electrical equipment. They are imported
in c.k.d. (completely knocked down)
form and assembled here.
The 460 tractor is in the 40 to 55 h.p.
class and is used mainly for cane and
broad-acre farming, pasture improve-
ment and secondary industry. The 342
is in the 30 to 40 h.p. class and is used
in orchards, dairies, market gardens and
for light farming. Nuffield sells 23.5 p.c.
of its tractors in NSW, 23.1 p.c. in
Queensland, 24.4 p.c. in Victoria and
Tasmania, 15.2 p.c. in SA and 13.8 p.c.
in WA.
Booming Nuffield sales, said an execu-
tive, had been caused by the granting of
new cane leases in Queensland, and the
general high level of agricultural pros-
perity. “We depend on world wool,
wheat and cane prices for our markets,”
he said.
An executive of Massey Ferguson
described demand at present as the best
he had seen for a decade. “Firm wool
prices and ready sales for all cereals, to-
gether with a depreciation allowance
which lets the farmer write off 120 p.c.
of his tractor in five years (he is allowed
to claim 20 p.c. of the cost and 20 p.c.
depreciation in the first year) have bene-
fited sales no end,” he said.
He sees a big market for tractors in
the future from the cotton industry. “It
is going to have a high sales potential for
tractors and tillage equipment.”
One tractor importer claimed that the
bigger horsepower tractors in use in
Australia were not being worked to their
full advantage because of the non-
availability of matched, bigger
implements. Mr Colin David-
son, general manager of Waugh
and Josephson Ltd’s farm equip-
ment division, which imports
John Deere tractors from
America, said that although
huskier tractors had improved
the Australian farmer’s lot, it
could be bettered still further if
it was economical to import the
matched implements.
“An extremely high pro-
tective tariff has been placed on
imported implements to protect
Australian manufacturers, who
claim they can make imple-
ments which will make full use
of bigger tractors. There has
not been much evidence of it so
far.
“But implements aside, big-
ger tractors have definitely helped Aus-
tralian agriculture. A tendency to put
larger acreages under cereal crops has
necessitated more power. It means that
the farmer can cover more distance in
one day without the fatigue associated
with a smaller tractor. It means, too, that
he can work more rapidly, for instance,
just after rain when he ploughs his land
to conserve moisture.
“This is following a trend that has
been evident in the US for a good many
years and is becoming more apparent
in Australia as the population grows.
With more efficient tillage made practi-
cable with the bigger power, better yields
are already being achieved in areas
where smaller tractors could not cope
with the work.
“But this does not mean the end of
the smaller tractor. There will be a lot
more use for them in row-crop farming,
which will become a more important
part of the Australian agricultural scene
with the increasing population,” Mr
Davidson added.

MARKET POINTERS
A Squeeze on Profits
After the Federal Budget of August
11, investors should consider the
combined effect of taxes, higher wages
and dearer money when assessing the
likely effects on shares.
Extra taxes and higher wages could
influence many companies to consider
capital investment programmes for long-
term growth rather than pay out profits
in the form of higher dividends.
The building trades obviously should
continue to benefit, following the
announcement that legislation for the
£250 housing grant would be pushed
through during the current Parliamentary
session.
Nonetheless, all groups now must con-
sider the impost of an extra 6d. in the
£1 for company tax, higher wage costs,
dearer borrowings and a restriction on
public spending.

A half-ounce type-core, no bigger than a golf ball, has changed the face of typing
overnight. It is the heart of the new IBM 72 Electric Typewriter and it eliminates the
moving carriage and all 44 type bars. This is the first major innovation in the history
of the electric typewriter. It cuts typing fatigue and lifts productivity. This type-core,
with its beautifully designed type face, is interchangeable, within seconds, with three
other cores, each strikingly individual in type face character. It produces correspondence
which commands the reader's attention.

Something’s Got to Give!
City hotels face strain of under-occupancy
Sydney's big hotel-owning public com-
panies are not the only ones finding
the going extremely tough. Down in
Melbourne the situation is just as bad,
if not worse. Latest evidence is from
Federal Hotels, which has reported a
group profit crumble from £200,000 to
£114,000 (2.9 p.c. ordinary earning rate)
for the year to June 30.
Ordinary dividend will be omitted for
the first time since 1950-51. Results
have come back every year since the
record £333,000 of 1959-60, earned
before a one-for-four bonus issue was
made. Dividends have followed an even
more catastrophic course: from 12i p.c.
in 1959-60 to 10 p.c. in 1961, 6i p.c. in
1962, 5 p.c. last year, and now nothing.
Although several items have contri-
buted to this poor performance, the
biggest by far has been the simple fact
that, in Melbourne, there are too many
hotel rooms available to meet a demand
which falls far short of the supply.
Prices, quality, position, service, etc., are
all virtually insignificant in relation to
this gross under-occupancy factor. Even
the city’s latest and probably best equip-
ped pub, the Southern Cross, has never
achieved anything like the 75 p.c. occu-
pancy rate on which directors banked
their original prospectus estimates—
despite extensive advertising and promo-
tion.
Most of Federal’s income is derived
from five wholly-owned hotels. Three
are in the city—Menzies, Savoy-Plaza
and Federal. In Sydney, the company
owns Hampton CouT and manages
the Menzies, in which some shares are
held. It also operates the Wrest Point at
Hobart, the Lennons group in Queens-
land and owns a hotel in Coburg, one
of Melbourne’s older suburbs.
The great extent to which every city
hotel is suffering, no matter who owns it,
indicates that sometime, somehow, some-
where, something’s got to give!
Plain basic economics backs up this
view. It’s pretty obvious that the majority
of companies and their shareholders
cannot afford to sit and wait until the
population rises to an extent big enough
to create a resonable occupancy rate.
So what will happen? There seems to
be three possibilities at present. The
first is takeover. Once one hotel had
taken over another, the latter could be
closed down and the building let for
other purposes, thus leaving the remain-
ing hotels open to absorb customers
from the old firm. Or, if enough hotels
were taken over, some companies may
see a possibility of reducing overall fixed
costs, thus increasing profits without any
change in occupancy percentages. This
course of action seems less likely than
the first. Moreover, it must be remem-
bered that most firms would find diffi-
culty in raising the necessary funds for
taking over any valuable city property.
The second possibility involves the
concept of the “survival of the fittest”.
If the current downward trends continue,
some firms must start to fold. The
luckier or “fitter” ones, who could hold
out a bit longer, would then recover
through increased occupancy. However,
it is unlikely that things would get so
bad as to create a position where many
hotels will close down, so this leads us
on to the third and most probable hap-
pening in the future—diversification.
This diversification possibility becomes
more realistic when one understands
that it could be tied in with the first—
takeover. If shares are depressed, a
company is very susceptible to this, and
not necessarily from within the same
industry. Many of the valuable city
properties would be ripe plums for other
firms at the right price. A cash take-
over would leave directors very free for
diversification. A share deal would also
put shareholders’ interests elsewhere. If
the new company held no appeal, then
shares could be sold and the cash placed
somewhere else again.
There are numerous other possibilities,
for example, a capital reconstruction,
such as Mutual Stores is undergoing.
This reduces paid capital and creates
earning rates and dividend possibilities
which are better than a profit which was
useless on the old capital.
Exactly what will happen is anybody’s
guess. After the current year's results
are out, the path will be clearer. Even
then, every company will probably fol-
low a different course to rejuvenation.
Record for Trustee
22 p.c. increase in the profit of
A the Trustee Executors and Agency
Co. during 1963-64 was the biggest rise
scored by the company for years. Up
from £25,000 to £32,000, the result
equals 23.1 p.c. on capital compared
with 18.3 p.c. last year. It provides
strong cover for the 15 p.c. dividend,
which is 1 p.c. higher than the 1963
payout.

provement was an increase in com-
missions and rent combined with a
lower tax provision—down from £20,000
to £13,000 despite the profit lift.
Another abnormal circumstance may
help the company boost profits by an
even bigger margin in the current year.
Victorian trustees have now increased
their scale of charges, to bring them in
line with NSW rates. Of course, any
increase from this source could be offset
by a return of tax to normal levels. If
such is not the case, shareholders may
be in for something better than a 1 p.c.
dividend increase in 1964-65.
Goninan’s Latest Result
Goninan and Co. Ltd, the subject
of a takeover offer from Howard
Smith Ltd, advised shareholders that pro-
fit for the year to June 30 was in the
vicinity of £220,000.
No mention was made of any capital
profit which may be included in this
figure.
In 1962-63, the company reported a
profit of £202,097, but this included
£17,360 net profit on the sale of invest-
ments.
Taking the 1964 result at face value,
the earning rate appears to be about
21.2 p.c. on capital enlarged by last
October's bonus.
Just for the record, Howard Smith’s
last reported earning rate was 16.1 p.c.
This was its best in a long while.
Tip Top for Weston
THip Top Bakeries Holdings Pty
earned £15,250 more at £450,265
in the last year to December, and it
paid over £406,221 to the parent, George
Weston Foods Ltd, compared with a
mere £83,346 the year before.
Result was after £291,386 tax and the
very high depreciation figure of
£689,234. The parent has often com-
plained of the high capital cost of bakery
plant and equipment in relation to the
restricted hours that the industrial awards
allow the bakeries to work.
Friends and Relations
A family association, as it were, put
'*"*• Pye Industries Ltd in the way of
a good deal.
Pye has taken over Ediswan-Ekco
(CRT) Co. Pty (jointly owned by Aus-
tralian Electrical Industries Ltd and
Ekco of England) for its tax losses of
over ££ million.
Ekco (or E. K. Cole Ltd) is owned
by British Electronic Industries Ltd,
which also owns Pye Ltd, the major
shareholder in Pye Industries.
Pye’s financial year ended on March
31 and results are due any day now.
The saving in tax, which the loss com-
pany will bring will operate in this cur-
rent year 1964-65.
A Slice from the Cake?
TAoes the paltry increase in Herbert
Adams’ dividend for the year to
June 30 indicate that directors are plan-
ning on making a new issue to share-
holders in the current year? The Mel-
bourne-based maker of cakes and pies
lifted profit from £124,000 to £153,000,
equalling around 20 p.c. on paid capital,
but the dividend has only been increased
from 12 p.c. to 12i p.c. Last year, when
the profit had moved up very marginally
from £120,000 to £124,000, the payout
was lifted from 10 p.c. to 12 p.c.
Going on last year’s actions, an in-
crease to 15 p.c. would have been the
logical thing this year. However, if the
directors are contemplating capital
moves during 1964-65 that would not be
the logical thing to do. With a dividend
of 15 p.c., a 20 p.c. earning rate would
not provide a very safe cover if capital


Tired of the
Executive
Rat-Race?
WELL, GET OUT OE IT!
The longer you ‘sit’ on a job the
harder it looks. Any good executive
knows that. Yet decisions are put
off by the thousand every day.
‘Difficult* jobs go into the ‘too
hard’ basket.
This procrastination is like a disease
in business. It’s the by-product of
the Executive Life. The pressure
goes on the strain gets tougher
the mind often flags. Result?
Work looks harder so takes more
out of you. So the mind flags more.
The rat-race is on.
A mind under pressure needs good
care. The executive life tension,
worry, hurried unbalanced meals,
alcohol often leads to a deficiency
of essential B Group vitamins.
These are the vitamins —BI in
particular which have a signifi-
cant effect in conserving nervous
energy. Additional B 1 is often pres-
cribed during periods of physical
stress and excessive mental activity.
You may not get adequate Vitamin
B from your meals. The drinks you
have to relax you, increase your
needs still further.
It’s comparatively easy to stop the
rat-race and get off. But you must
make a decision. You must put
yourself on to ‘TAB-VITA’ B
GROUP FORT tablets. This is a
potent source of B group vitamins
enriched with Vitamin C. It is not
a miracle ‘cure’ but if taken regularly
may do a lot to help restore your
initiative and drive. Get out of that
rat-race. Tear out this advertisement
and go to your chemist. Or send

was suddenly increased by a share
issue for takeover purposes or to
shareholders.
If an issue is in the wind, shareholders
are most likely to be the first in line.
With a market price of 14s. 6d., the
scrip could easily support quite a heavy
premium and still leave plenty for
shareholders in the way of capital gains.
Such a high market price for the ss.
shares also means that directors could
tack on a premium which enabled the
raising of a certain amount of cash with-
out boosting paid capital to any
dangerous extent.
Moreover, it must not be forgotten
that, despite the company’s excellent and
profitable record since listing in 1960,
shareholders have received no direct
benefits from the company at all. With
the exception, of course, of the annual
dividend cheque.
Vulcan’s First Capital Issue
"11/lelbourne electrical and oil appliance
maker, Vulcan Industries Ltd, has
announced a one-for-five issue of ss.
shares at 2s. 6d. premium.
Proceeds of the issue will be £150,000.
It will raise paid capital to £600,000 and
create a share premium reserve of
£50,000.
Directors advised that substantial costs
of establishing leadership in the rapidly
growing domestic oil-heater market were
absorbed in current trading.
The profit of £107,000 for the latest
June year compares with £102,878 in
1962-63 and £120,214 in 1961-62.
The company obtained listing in Mel-
bourne after a public issue in August,
1961, and joined the Sydney list in April,
1962. This is its first capital move
since going public.
A purchase at present price of 13s. 9d.
for the ss. shares would average back to
12s. Bd. after the issue—scheduled for
November-December—and give a yield
of just under 4 p.c. while the 10 p.c.
dividend rules.
EMI Marks Time
(Australia) Ltd more or less
marked time in the year to June 30.
Profit picked up 7 p.c. to £438,153, but
it still is way off the 1960 peak of
£541,808.
Tax and depreciation provisions were
virtually unchanged from 1962-63 levels.
Hire-purchase debts of £37,991 (1963,
£1549) and trading debts of £18,491
(£14,093) were written off. Furthermore,
bad debts incurred prior to the year
under review, £38,770, were charged
against the provision for contingencies.
EMI was owed large sums by Reid
Murray and Inglis Electrix.
The group is best known for its pro-
duction and distribution of “His Master’s
Voice ’ radios, records and television
sets.
New earning rate of 33.7 p.c. is highly
satisfactory in relation to the generous
dividend of 14} p.c. Since the TV
boom has waned the company misses its
richest vein.
Swans Ascending
Ltd, Sydney hardware merchant,
arrested a three-year trend of falling
profits half-way through the latest year
to May 31.
An increase in the demand for build-
ing materials allowed the company to
produce a net profit of £91.672 after
tax of £48,000 and depreciation of
£10,587. (The 1962-63 profit of £86,900
was after tax of £50,500 and depreciation
of £10,142.)
Directors said that owing to the credit
position in the industry, the company
had to be very selective in giving credit.
Dividend for the third year running is
9 p.c. and contrasts with 10 p.c. in
1960-61 and 12} p.c. in 1959-60. New
earning rate is a modest 11.1 p.c. The
20s. shares sell for around 265. to yield
an immediate 6.9 p.c.
Union Dues
A one-for-ten bonus from Union
Carbide Australia Ltd is a sop for
growth-conscious Australian investors,
who hold only about 40 p.c. of paid
capital.
Policy has been controlled by Union
Carbide Corporation of the USA, which,
on the merger of Timbrol Ltd and the
Australian subsidiaries of the UCC in
mid-1957, obtained about 60 p.c. of the
capital.
Since that date shareholders have re-
ceived a steady 10 p.c. dividend from
earnings which varied from 20.2 p.c. in
1958 to 8.4 p.c. in 1962, year to June.
The current bonus, to shareholders re-
gistered at September 7, is the only
sweetener they have had in eleven years
and therefore hardly marks the stock as
one for growth.

Present price of 775. 6d. gives an ex-
bonus price of 70s. sd. and yield of
2.8 p.c.
Despite the impressiveness of its
parent, the company proved vulnerable
to imports competition and the credit
restrictions of 1961-62, when earnings
failed to cover the usual dividend.
Shareholders suffered a loss of con-
fidence. The shares trailed down to
about 525. 6d. in 1962.
The latest profit reported for the year
to June, 1964, shows a 27.6 p.c. re-
covery to £412,519 and is equal to 17.2
p.c. on the bonus-enlarged capital.
(Bonus shares rank for the final 5 p.c.
dividend.)
Curing the Dividend
A ustralian Bacon’s result for the year
to April 30, although not good
enough to warrant an ordinary dividend,
augurs well for shareholders in the cur-
rent year. Profit rose from £4OOO to
£17,000, equalling a paltry 1.9 p.c. on
capital. Back in 1962, before trouble
set in, £84,000 was earned, from which
a 10 p.c. dividend was distributed.
Swine-fever problems decimated per-
formance in 1963, and also crippled
operations in the first eight months of
the year just passed. The fever outbreak
necessitated restrictions on pig produc-
tion and, hence, shortages of pork and
pork products. Competition for insuffi-
cient supplies forced pig prices to very
high levels.
As a bacon curer and smallgoods
manufacturer, the company struck big
increases in livestock and distribution
costs. The percentage of net profit to
turnover was reduced to purely marginal
levels —the latest £17,000 profit was
earned from sales of some £6 million.
In 1964-65 the story should be differ-
ent. Swine-fever has now completely
vanished and all restrictions on produc-
tion were abolished in December. Thus,
it was only the last four months to
April 30 that helped score the profit rise.
Since then, trading should have been at
around the old 1961 and 1962 levels.
The annual meeting and the interim
report (released each February) will be
shareholders' best guide to the 1964-65
result. Chances for a return of dividends
are undoubtedly high.
Worthy Esanda
An earning rate of 31 p.c. on capital
and 17.9 p.c. on shareholders’ funds
is the magnificent performance of
Esanda Ltd, wholly owned subsidiary of
ES and A Bank Ltd.
Profit rose 9 p.c. to £775,825 (after
£442,496 tax) in the year to June and
compares with only £302,878 in 1959-
60.
Outstandings rose 18 p.c. A higher
volume of business written over a varied
range of financing produced the record
result, directors said in their preliminary
advice.
Pelaco Set for Success
2s. jump in Pelaco’s 10s. shares
*■ after last week’s spectacular recovery
announcement should be the first step
in a gradual price rise, which the shares
now deserve. As a manufacturer of
shirts, pyjamas and women’s wear, per-
formance is naturally subject to relatively
big variations. At present, it is apparent
that the company’s reorganisation has
been completely successful and the
stage is set for a new period of growth.
Profit in the year to June 30 more
than trebled to £142,000, equalling 19.9
p.c. on ordinary capital. Dividend is up
from 4 p.c. to 10 p.c. This recovery is
remarkable. In 1961-62, £77,000 was
lost and dividend was omitted. Last year
a £43,000 profit was chalked up and 4

p.c. of the 5.4 p.c. earning rate went
out as dividends. The latest dividend is
the highest since 1959-60 and the profit
is the company’s best since 1956-57.
Although it may take some time for
investors’ faith in the firm to be restored
after the recent patchy record, the
shares are at present worth more than
the 12s. 9d. they touched after results
were announced. To start with, they
were higher than this before all the dif-
ficulties started. In addition, the present
price returns a colossal dividend yield of
7.8 p.c., which will prove attractive to
those interested in a healthy income.
At balance date last year, each 10s.
share had a net tangible asset backing
of 18s. 44d., another factor which must
draw the price up. This year’s annual
report will probably reveal an increase
in this cover and give a good indication
as to the profitability of trading in the
current year.
With an already successful export
business under way and a drive for extra
overseas business still going on, a spread
of markets is being achieved which must
give the firm more stability than any
other manufacturer in the rag trade. It
may be wise for investors to mark time
until they can evaluate statements made
in the annual report and at the annual
meeting. Yet as success in the immediate
future is well on the cards already, the
share price could easily move to more
appropriate levels before these state-
ments are at hand.
Catering for Investors
Sydney restaurateur and caterer Cahills
Holdings Ltd increased sales 10 p.c.
and profit 40 p.c. in the year to June 30.
Net result of £50,557, after £32,150
tax and £16,498 depreciation, was equal
to 25.2 p.c on capital, encouraging the
directors to recommend a dividend in-
crease from 124 p.c. to 15 p.c.
The company was in the news in May,
when it made an unsuccessful bid for
furniture and floor covering wholesaler,
George G. Clarke Ltd.
The ss. shares meet with market ap-
proval and sell for around 16s. 3d. The
yield is 4.6 p.c.
New Spark of Life
Tt is to be hoped that last week's buoy-

bulk of them have yet to announce their
results. Coates, based in Melbourne,
operates chiefly as an engineer in these
two fields.

rate improved from 9.1 p.c. to 12.9 p.c.
which does not leave much margin for
setbacks if the payout is to continue.
A setback in 1964-65 seems rather
unlikely, though. In the December half-
year of 1963-64, according to directors
in last February’s interim report, profits
increased only “satisfactorily” after a
27 p.c. sales rise. However, as the result
ended almost 40 p.c. higher than 1962-
63, business must have gained new
momentum in the latter half year. At
the annual meeting, the chairman, Mr
H. T. Craig, may point out to share-
holders whether this momentum is con-
tinuing into the current year.
Of course, part of the second halfs
big increases would be due to seasonal
conditions. Government spending is
bigger in the June half and better
weather conditions this year also would
have helped, especially in the road-
making activities. It is fairly obvious that
the business must have received some
new spark of life apart from these factors
to lift results so steeply over the year,
after increases had merely been satisfac-
tory in the first six months.
Express Speed
A yield of 3.7 p.c. will be obtained
from a current purchase of the ss.
shares of Yellow Express Carriers Ltd,
after the one-for-five bonus. This is no
great bargain, but it could be very
sound buying for the medium to long-
term.
Directors expect to hold the 15 p.c.
dividend (the rate paid for the last 11
years) on the watered capital.
Old shareholders are now being re-
compensed for the 50 p.c. premium they
paid on the one-for-four issue in Febru-
ary, 1961.
A couple of months after that issue,
Yellow Express took over W. Cross and
Sons Pty and R. H. O'Regan (Carriers)
Ltd. The surplus on consolidation greatly
strengthened group reserves.
The current bonus will lift paid capita]
by £128,231 to £769,390, absorbing the
whole of the share premium reserve
(£54,893) and £73,338 of capital assets
revaluation.
The company's profit advanced 11 p.c.
or £17,698 to £174,240, to show an
earning rate of 27.2 p.c.
There have been a number of mer-
gers in the transport industry of late.
It is evident the company is anxious for
the stock to sustain a high market pre-
mium.
Diecaster for Public Lists
lAepending on the prospectus dividend
and profit estimates, and the size
of any premium which the ss. shares
may carry, some scrip from the public
float of Huckson Industries could prove
a valuable addition to an investor’s port-
folio. The public issue will be only
small —in fact, probably just enough to
qualify for public listing. Melbourne’s
Guest and Bell will be brokers to the
issue.
As most of the firm’s business is done
with the currently booming automotive
and building industries, the immediate
future should be rosy for any new
shareholder. Of course, the rise an-
nounced in sales tax on new cars in last
week’s Budget may detract slightly from
this picture.
The firm’s history can be traced back
to 1922, when Mr H. J. Huckson set
himself up in business as a diecaster in
Wagga. The firm took his business over
in 1929 and centred operations out at
Springvale. It pioneered the diecasting
of hardware in Australia in the 19305.

THE PRINCELY HOLIDAY
Today it manufactures and markets
under its own name a wide range of
fittings for metal and timber windows
and general hardware items. A sub-
stantial part of its business is the supply
of contract castings for the automotive
and other industries.
Apart from the main factory in
Springvale, a branch factory is also
running in Matraville, NSW. The move
there was made in 1949 to help meet
the substantial demand that was building
up from industry in that State.
Look to Gerrard
the Melbourne-based manu-
facturer and distributor of machi-
nery, steel and wire products, is worth
taking a closer look at if one is after a
solid sort of investment that offers good
prospects of medium-term capital
growth. The dividend yield is only
moderate, but there are chances for an
increase in 1964-65. This, combined
with the company’s buoyant present per-
formance and the distinct possibility of a
shareholders’ issue in the current year,
should gradually push the market price
up.
The 1963-64 results were released last
week. Profit rose from £303,000 to
£348,000 and lifted earning rate from
19.5 p.c. to 22.5 p.c.—a generous cover
for the 12i p.c. dividend. The last time
20 p.c. earnings were exceeded was in
1959-60, before several new issues and
share takeovers. The dividend distribu-
tion is steady at last year's new record
rate.
With sales in the first two months of
the current year showing an improve-
ment over the same months of 1963-64,
shareholders could be in for another
record year and some extra benefits.
A Running Start
A profit of £58,267 was turned in by
A. V. Wehl Industries Ltd for the
year to June 30, 1964, its first as a pub-
lic company.
The earning rate of 32.3 p.c. on capi-
tal increasing by £46,000 to £lBO,OOO
delighted shareholders. Directors had
forecast in the prospectus a dividend of
at least 10 p.c. They were able to exceed
this by paying 12i p.c.
The company specialises in the whole-
sale distribution of laminated plastics,
flake boards and associated products, and
produces at Essendon (Vic.) a range of
bathroom vanity units marketed under
the “Lami-form” trade mark.
During the year it purchased Ply-
craft Pty, which had valuable freehold
premises at Arncliffe (NSW), suitable for
production and distribution of the
group’s existing product range.
Plycraft brought tax losses to the
group, thus allowing A. V. Wehl to pro-
vide only £18,793 on a pre-tax profit of
£77,060. Normally about £30,800
would have been required on the old
basis of Bs. in the £.
The boom in private building, of
course, provided perfect trading condi-
tions for A. V. Wehl in its maiden year.
The stock should still continue to be
worth watching. The ss. shares are now
around 15s. 6d. to yield 4 p.c.

Choosing from New Zealand
Auckland broker picks Australian stocks
Tn August last year, an Auckland share-
broker recommended a dozen Aus-
tralian stocks to his clients.
His selection was based on three con-
siderations: (1) earning rate on average
ordinary shareholders’ funds of at least
10 p.c.; (2) earnings yield at least twice
the dividend yield; (3) activities likely to
benefit from improving economic con-
ditions.
These considerations, particularly the
first two, have proved their importance
in the past year. For although the
broker’s dozen included three “losers”,
an investor who took up 100 shares in
each company in August last year would,
by July 31, 1964, have made a gain of
16.8 p.c. In the same period, the Syd-
ney index rose only 9.9 p.c.
Of the three stocks whose price went
down, Amalgamated Chemicals was re-
commended because, on evidence up to
August last year, it had not shared the
general recession in the chemical field.
Lend Lease was expected to benefit from
the upward trend. The share price of
the third “loser”, David Jones, has been
depressed by the £1 million placement
early this year.
Of course, the selection of possible
growth stocks based on high earnings
yield compared with dividend return is
very common. However, the importance
attached to earnings on average funds is
a fairly unusual feature for Australia,
although in New Zealand this rate is
frequently used as a yardstick.
The philosophy behind this is that a
sharp improvement in earning rate on
capital may cause a pronounced market
reaction, resulting in a quick gain, par-
ticularly in special situations. For the
long-term investor, the main considera-
tion is whether a company employs all
its shareholders’ funds, capital and re-
serves, at a sufficiently high rate of
profit.
The reasoning is that if, over a period
of several years, a company has not
earned at the rate of at least 7 to 8 p.c.
on funds, its prospects for future bonus
issues and dividend increases are pretty
slender. Those who make their long-
term purchases on this basis do not want
earning rate on funds to show a steady,
if only relatively small decline, however
high the earning rate on capital, because
this decline would indicate that the com-
pany is becoming less profitable to its
owners.
For instance,, an investor guided by
this principle would not look long at a
stock like Henry Jones, whose earning
rate on funds has declined from 11.8 p.c.
in 1954 to 6.5 p.c. in 1963 by a gradual
downward movement.
For fairly young companies, like Vul-
can, which earn at a high rate on funds
(not too much below that on capital),
this can be a pointer for rapid growth.
Here the importance of the high rate is
only a medium-term one, as it might ease
when more reserves have been accumu-
lated.
The table gives prices, earning rates
and yields as at July 31, 1963, prices a
year later and the percentage gain, ad-
justed for issues.

GTV-9 BUILDS AUSTRALIA’S
LARGEST TELEVISION STUDIO
Now taking shape a new suburb for Melbourne’s
Television City, GTV-9. This new studio will be
Australia’s largest 9,000 square feet floor area,
with a total production area of 20,000 square feet.
Large audience capacity, t 00—350 people!
Studio Nine at GTV-9 will have the most advanced
picture mixing equipment, offering effects never
before seen in Australia. Studio Nine's new solid-
state sound console will mix 32 individual sound
sources tripling to 96. This means the best pos-
sible quality television sound. All new GTV-9
facilities will be available for commercial videotape
production.
GTV-9 builds confidently for the future. And October,
1964, when Studio Nine takes the air, will mark
another exciting era for Australia’s best equipped
station.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
AWA Shares Fully Priced
Even making allowances for a glamorous future
T ast March the directors of Amalga-
mated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd
reported that “trading conditions for the
half-yeq£ to December 31, 1963, in con-
sumer products continued to be very
competitive and subject to fluctuating
demand. Nevertheless, the overall opera-
tions of the company have been main-
tained at satisfactory level”. The final
dividend will not be announced until
next October, if the normal pattern is
followed, and the published accounts for
1963-64 will not normally be available
until December. Yet over the last three
months, while the rest of the market (as
judged by the Sydney all ordinary index)
has been moving sideways, AWA’s shares
have increased in price by 17 p.c. and,
provided that the company again pays
16 p.c., the immediate dividend yield is
2.7 p.c.
To some extent, the chairman’s address
last year suggested that the 16 p.c. rate
was a special one, for it includes the
following words: “. . . the directors felt
that it would be your wish to mark the
fiftieth anniversary of your company by
the payment of a special bonus of 6 p.c.
in addition to the dividend of 10 p.c.”
With a view to examining the situation
of the dividend and “bonus” rates, the
following table shows these rates over the
last six years:
June 30 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963
(percentages)
Dividend 10 11 11 10 10 10
Bonus 4 5 5 4 4 6
Total 14 16 16 14 14 16
Regrettably, I do not have sufficient
information to discriminate between divi-
dends and bonus in earlier years. After
making adjustments for the 1-for-l bonus
issue made in August, 1956, the total
rate would seem to have been roughly
as follows:
June 30 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957
(percentages)
61 71 7\ 8 9
From these figures a cynic might
suggest that the “growth” period ceased
in 1960 and the company is now showing
a cyclical pattern, depending to a large
extent on the demand for television and
radio sets. Unfortunately we can only
guess at the position because of the
change in presentation of figures from
1962 onwards. Profits disclosed prior
to 1962 related to the parent company
only are shown in the next table.
These figures would suggest that the
company still has some way to go before
it even catches up with the “TV boom”
years of 1957-58, 1958-59 and 1959-60.

There is no link between the annual
accounts produced under the old method
and those produced under the new, be-
cause the 1962 report did not give com-
parable figures for the previous year.
The item of some interest to the analyst
is labelled “Amounts set aside-to pro-
visions other than for depreciation, re-
newals or diminution in value of assets”.
For the year 1962-63 the amount appear-
ing in the consolidated profit and loss
account is £124,136. The provisions
recognisable in the consolidated balance
sheet are as follows:
1961/62 1962/63 Increase
£ £ £
Long - service leave
and other sundry
provisions 612,109 679,585 67,476
Provision for doubt-
ful debts 240,417 243,540 3,123
Provision for future
adjustments .(stock
and work in pro-
gress) 285,014 388,552 103,538
1,137,540 1,311,677 174,137
Profit and loss account item (after
allowing for rounding to the nearest £)
seems to be exactly £50,000 less than
the balance sheet movement. In the
parent company’s accounts, the discre-
pancy is £18,144.
Turning next to the depreciation pro-
vision, the sum mentioned in the consoli-
dated profit and loss account represents
13.2 p.c of the net book value prior to
writing off the depreciation. As 50 p.c.
of this net book value consisted of land
and buildings, it seems fair to say that
depreciation being provided is probably
adequate. Again, correlation between
the profit and loss account figure and
the balance sheet figures cannot be estab-
lished, since the movement in the balance
sheet figure is £95,840 less than the
profit and loss account figure so far as
the consolidated accounts are concerned
and £73,293 less so far as the parent
company accounts are concerned. Natu-
rally enough, disposal of plant and real
estate during the year can make such
differences perfectly valid and it was
stated in the directors’ report that “the
sum of £13,455 non-recurring profit
from the sale of shares and real estate
has been credited to general reserve”.
No doubt most interested observers
have already examined the tax provi-
sion and therefrom have “imputed”
earnings at something like £1.2 million
or at least 50 p.c. better than disclosed.
Unfortunately we do not know what
proportion of the £742,000 trading pro-
fit of the subsidiaries was contributed
by the New Zealand subsidiary (whose
tax rates would be different from the
Australian rates) and quite naturally we
do not get any clue from the annual
report. From what has already been
discussed we could surmise that the Tax
Commissioner would “add-back” in
probably the following:
1. £103,000 credit to the provision
for future adjustments (deducted
from stock and work in progress).
2. £50,000 at least which we cannot
trace in the profit and loss account
figures, but which seems to have
intruded into the balance sheet
and most likely the £67,000 of
“other sundry provisions”.
3. Some of the profit and loss
account depreciation provision
which, as already pointed out, ex-
ceeds the movement in the balance
sheet by about £96,000.
Generally it seems that the company
believes in financing internally, because
in the last ten years only £BOO,OOO has
been raised by share and note issues but
reserves shown in the balance sheet other
than share premium reserve have in-
creased by £3.4 million. Roughly, then,
£4 has been retained from profits for
every £1 raised during this period of
ten years. In 1962/63, the so-called
“cash flow” (earnings plus depreciation
less dividends) was close to £900,000
and could well have been in excess of
£1 million. Furthermore, hardly any
use has been made of borrowed money.
The company is certainly involved in
an acknowledged “growth” industry,
namely the “defence” industry, but one
wonders in all the circumstances whether
the other interests do not tend to
outweigh this advantage. The shares
certainly seem fully priced at present
levels, even making allowances for a
glamorous future. But looking at the
last ten years, the rate of growth in per
share dividends has averaged 10 p.c.
annual compound. Admittedly the
growth is due largely to the one-for-one
bonus issue in 1956 (which seemed at
the time to be associated with the pro-
posed merger with Email). Many of
our other leading stocks cannot claim
such a record, but then they do not
seem to have had the same problems in
the last five years which caused AWA to
reduce the dividend for two years out
of the five.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Those Fascinating Investments
Burns Philp for the long term
£3 million appreciation in the
market value of investments in listed
companies held by Burns Philp and Co.
Ltd in the year to March 31, 1964, held
greater fascination for market observers
than the advance in profit to record levels.
Shares and debentures in listed com-
panies had a book value at 1964 balance
date of £10,846,125, and a market
value of £24,294,713. This makes Burns
Philp the largest investment company in
Australia outside life assurance com-
panies.
The company also held a sizeable
swag of Government and semi-Govern-
ment securities, shares in unlisted com-
panies, loans and mortgages, so that the
book value of its total investments came
to £15,178,053.
It appears that the market value of
these group investments, counting loans
and mortgages at cost and non-listed
investments at directors’ valuation, is
approximately £28,890,000.
The investment portfolio alone there-
fore affords considerable scope for
future revaluation, with the object of
issuing bonus scrip.
A one-for-four bonus is now pending
(books close October 30) to capitalise
£l.B million of assets revaluation re-
serves, bringing paid capital to £9 mil-
lion. Last year’s appreciation in the
market value of the portfolio of listed
investments could be the source, if
directors so desired, of a further bonus
in the ratio of one-for-three.
The current bonus follows a one-for-
five in October, 1962, and a similar one
in October, 1959, and a one-for-four in
May, 1958.
The company was registered in NSW
in 1883 to acquire the business of Sir
James Burns and Sir Robert Philp, who
played leading roles in the development
of Queensland. Shipping services were
established on the Queensland coast.
These were extended to New Guinea and
the Far East.
Copra, cocoa and rubber plantations
and trading stores are owned in New
Guinea, Papua, and the Islands. Large
stores are operated in NSW and
Queensland, although the major chain of
Penneys was sold to G. J. Coles in 1957.
Through this transaction Burns Philp
became a large shareholder in Coles.
Substantial, though not majority share-
holdings, are held in Queensland Insur-
ance Co. Ltd and Bankers and Traders’
Insurance Co. Ltd, both of which joined
with Burns Philp in 1960 to buy Equit-
able Probate and General Insurance Co.
Ltd. The investment in Equitable Pro-
bate would be part of the portfolio of
non-listed investments.
Included in the list of subsidiaries are
Murray Brothers (Parramatta) Pty and
its parent Parramatta Holdings Pty, BNG
Trading Co. Ltd of Port Moresby and
its subsidiaries, Port Moresby Freezing

Net balance of profit on trading, as
shown in the profit and loss account,
rose from £2,205,926 to £2,761,994 ip
the year under review. Directors said
that there was a “gratifying increase in
merchandise sales, both through whole-
sale branches and retail subsidiaries”,
although rising costs absorbed most of
the advantage.
Revenue from investments and plan-
tation interests were “up to expectations”.
Cocoa tonnages increased once more.
Markets were profitable for the better
grades of produce.
Losses were again incurred on the
shipping services. Despite good patronage
in cargo and passenger traffic, costs con-
tinually overtake income. However, as
other shippers have pointed out, main-
tenance of shipping services is essential
to the overall operation of the group,
and undoubtedly they will be continued.
Burns Philp has ordered a new cargo
vessel to be built at Newcastle by the
Australian Shipbuilding Board, to replace
the Malaita. A footnote to the accounts
shows a contingent liability for
£940,000, being the balance of the pur-
chase price. The Burnside was sold at
an acceptable price after 1964 balance
date.
The company itself reports a rise in
group profits remaining to Burns Philp
and Co. Ltd, from £1,341,995 to
£1,693,768, including £32,592 capital
profits on sale of assets. These figures,
however, were after various provisions,
which might be considered more accur-
ately as appropriations.
After providing £747,274 for tax and
£434,494 for depreciation, the group
profit was £2,034,161 (1963, £1,782,145)
before providing and appropriating
£200,000 for tonnage replacement,
£125,000 for property replacement,
£29,500 for plant replacement on con-
version to decimal currency, and £18,485
sundry provisions.
Income from listed companies rose
from £655,106 to £710,736, and that
from other investments fell slightly from
£225,008 to £219,090. It is worth
noting that the total income from invest-
ments of £929,826 alone more than
covers the 10 p.c. dividend requirement
of £720,000.
The earning rate calculated on a net
profit of £1,661,176 (excluding capital
profits and after provisions for asset re-
placements) is 23.1 p.c. on capital of
£7.2 million. On the figure of £2,034,161
(obtained before provisions for asset
replacements), the earning rate is 28.6
p.c.
Taking the more generous profit figure,
the return on shareholders’ funds of
£31,272,401 is an unexceptional 6.5 p.c.
Cum the October bonus, the shares
have been selling about £5 17s. 6d. As
the 10 p.c. dividend will be continued
on post-bonus capital, the yield from a
current purchase is a mere 2.1 p.c. At
that price it is definitely not of interest
to anyone other than genuine long-term
investors.

ROBERT BRYCE AND CO. LTD
Hopes from Manufacturing
year 1963-64 marked an important
milestone for Robert Bryce and Co.
Ltd in the diversification of its activities
into manufacturing.
The company has been operating since
1913 (and before that as a partnership)
as indentor, importer and merchant, sup-
plying industrial raw materials, interme-
diates and equipment to firms throughout
Australia and New Zealand. The indus-
tries for which it especially caters are
agricultural, bedding and brush, electro-
plating, food and cosmetics, commercial
laundries, leather, paint, paper, plastics,
surface coatings and textiles.
During 1963-64 (year ended March
31), Robert Bryce acquired an interest in
Weldex Pty, a company formed by
Philips Electrical Industries Pty, to make
and sell Philips welding electrodes in
Australia. Since balance date, Bryce in-
creased its share to a controlling interest.
Production is beginning. The Philips
electrodes are being made at a modern
£250,000 factory on a 21-acre site at
Notting Hill (Vic.). Weldex has been
awarded the current NSW Government
contract for welding electrodes and
Bryce has high hopes for this business.
In consequence of this development,
Bryce has relinquished its agency for
Quasi Arc electrodes from Common-
wealth Industrial Gases.
The year to March saw further re-
covery in Bryce’s profit from the weak
position of 1961-62, when dividend was
cut to 10 p.c. and reserves had to be
drawn on to pay this. The profit moved
up from £72,183 to £80,213, after pro-
viding £55,694 (1963, £51,579) for tax
and £14,917 (£14,982) for depreciation.
Reserves were increased from
£422,903 to £475,781, partly by a re-
valuation of one of the company’s in-
vestments by £27,500, which was subse-
quently realised at sale. Paid capital is
unchanged at £440,874.
The chairman (Mr J. C. Farrin Webb)
reported that price levels and profit mar-
gins remained intensely competitive.
Higher sales enabled the company to
improve on the previous year’s profit.
He indicated that sales in the current
year were displaying a healthy trend.
New premises were established in
Auckland (NZ) to cater for the growing
trade there.
A branch was opened in WA during
the year under review.
The company reported with satisfac-
tion that it had obtained a contract on
behalf of its principal, VAB Calor of
Sweden, for the complete equipping of
washroom and sorting sections of the
new central laundry established by the
SA Government at Islington. This pro-
ject was the largest of its kind in Austra-
lia for many years. The installation
should be completed in September, 1965.
Shareholders of Robert Bryce received
a one-for-three bonus in 1958. The
17| p.c. dividend then ruling was main-
tained until the economic difficulties of
1961 became evident arid dictated a
cautionary attitude by directors. The
dividend was trimmed to 15 p.c. that year
and, after the heavy profit fall in 1961-
62, to 10 p.c.
At the present price of 9s. 7d. to yield
6.5 p.c. in income and 9.5 p.c. on earn-
ings, the ss. shares look quite an inter-
esting proposition, considering the new
dimension the business is given by the
entry to manufacturing.
SWAN BREWERY CO. LTD
Very Good for Investors
npHE Swan Brewery Company Ltd is
A one of the few Australian firms that
managed to achieve a strong rise in
profits, earning rates and dividends over
the past three years. It has emerged
unscathed from a depressed economy
which left many permanent scars in the
Stock Exchange history books. The
future now looks excellent.
Any investor buying into the com-
pany now has good prospects for seeing
his money doubled by the end of the
19605. Economic conditions over the
past five years made such a task very
difficult but, nevertheless, it was done.
In 1959 the scrip sold between 10s. and
15s. Today it is around the 30s. mark
and any 1959 holding has been in-
creased by the one-for-seven bonus issue
made in 1961-62. Rising share prices,
and more issues which will undoubtedly
go the shareholders’ way, make the
current 30s. price very attractive,
especially for long-term holding.
Of course, the fantastic growth in
financial stature over the last five years
is largely attributable to the rapid ex-
pansion of the company’s home State,
Western Australia. There is every reason
to believe that WA’s growth in the next
five years will be just as good as this,
if not better. Moreover, Swan is becom-
ing less reliant on its local market every
year. Exports now go to 46 countries
and this number is still growing. About
5 p.c. of the 20 million-odd gallons
produced annually goes overseas.
The year’s trading turned in a record
profit of £788,000 for the ordinary
shares and lifted earning rate from 7.5
p.c. to 19.2 p.c., the highest since 1949-
50. It was after the usual heavy pro-
visions which directors make every
year. In the annual report, they point
out that “in a business such as ours the
values of fixed assets are something of
a matter of opinion and not necessarily
related to cost”.
It usually augurs well for the future
when such adequate amounts are pro-
vided for the depreciation and amortisa-
tion of assets. This policy is regarded
by many as being indicative of a com-
pany which has “secret reserves” or is
“bonus prone”. Swan falls with a thump
into both these categories as far as
stockbrokers and market observers are
concerned. Their opinions have been
greatly reinforced because of a state-
ment made by directors in a booklet on
the company which accompanied the
annual report: “There has been a prudent
tendency to state net profits on a con-
servative basis, and shareholders have
benefited in the past also from bonus
issues and new issues on favorable
terms.”
The mention of shareholders’ issues
in the same breath as a comment on
“conservative” profit statements strongly
endorses the view that the two are con-
nected in this case. The balance sheet
shows that reserves are slightly above
paid capital, so the time is ripe for a
bonus issue.
In the latest financial year, Swan paid
£9.7 million out in excise tax, compared
with £9.1 million previously. This figure
is nearly 16 times the amount distributed
to shareholders as dividends. The tax
is 9s. lOd. a gallon, or just under 7ld.
on each 1 Ooz. pot.
Whatever happens, Swan is un-
doubtedly set for big things in the
future, even if the present growth rate
is slowed temporarily. It is well en-

trenched in the market and could not
possibly be more secure financially
the balance sheet values the share-
holders’ equity in the £lO million group
at £8.4 million.
The table below shows an excellent
record of achievement despite the
economic difficulties of the past five
The deficiency of working capital
means nothing—it’s a state under which
most brewers operate. Fixed assets
show a steady growth except for a minor
setback in 1961. Reserves show a similar
trend despite the bonus issue of 1961-
62. Net profits have been lifted sub-
stantially each year and so has the
amount left over after dividends, a sub-
stantial feat seeing paid capital and
dividends were rising at the same time.
This rising capital, the dividend in-
creases and the climbing earning rates
are three factors which very rarely occur
simultaneously. When they do, share-
holders get further benefits because of
price rises on the market. The table
shows that the share price has more than
doubled the 1960 levels.
As previously mentioned, group out-
put is at present in the vicinity of 20
million gallons a year. At any one time,
3 million of these are in storage or pro-
duction, so there is plenty in reserve,
so to speak. In a rather amusing
exercise, directors said in the booklet
on the company that the largest storage
unit is a huge glass-lined cylinder which
holds 263 hogsheads, or 14,202 gallons.
“If a man on his 21st birthday began
drinking the contents of one of these
giants at the rate of five pints a day
it would take him 62 years. And, even
allowing for leap years in that time, he
would have 48 gallons left over to enjoy
a really big party on his 83rd birthday.”
The Bulletin strongly suggests that
if this same man purchased 100 Swan
Brewery shares on his 21st birthday, he
could accumulate a small fortune by his
83rd birthday, as well as a substantial
beer pot.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Few Budget-induced Alterations
Most stocks worth retention in the porfolio
rPHE usual round of criticism from the
usual quarters followed the Budget.
In view of Australia’s urgent need for
greater defence, it’s a wonder that a
greater allocation in this direction was
not made.
From the stock-market angle the
Budget contained two surprises. Firstly,
there was the 6d. increase in company
taxation, which will be an additional
burden for all profitable companies. In-
cidentally, it has the side effect of mak-
ing tax-loss companies more valuable.
The other surprise was the Government’s
reluctance to increase indirect taxes,
namely sales taxes.
The motor-car industry got off very
lightly, with only a 2\ p.c. increase in
sales tax. As for appliances, they escap-
ed scot free. This makes Malleys, Kel-
vinator and even General Industries very
good buying, especially as home building
is still being encouraged.
Home-building statistics continue to
rise at an extraordinary rate. The June
quarter showed that new commence-
ments jumped by 27 p.c.
The same percentage rise was shown
in the sales of William Adams in the
first three months of this year. As was
mentioned last week, 1963-64 sales had
shown a 20 p.c. increase over sales in
the previous year. Like the annual re-
port, the chairman’s address serves as a
model for other companies to follow.
Using specific language, he clearly out-
lined the progress of the four major divi-
sions, then went on to explain in detail
items in the balance sheet. It read so
well that I was tempted to increase my
holding.
Likewise, increasing my tin invest-
ments had crossed my mind. One
authoritative overseas report sees little
likelihood of either consumption falling
or production rising in the short term.
Also, the 20,000 tons now being re-
leased by the GSA every year is not
proving sufficient to close the gap. The
world price of £1285 sterling per ton is
almost at its record peak for the ’sixties.
After satisfying myself that most of
the stocks in the portfolio deserved to
be held, the one addition this week was
600 Kolotex at 14s. 3d.
Since the company was reconstructed
in 1962, it has soared ahead. Previ-
ously trading under the name of Rosslyn
Hosiery (Holdings) Ltd, it ran into
trouble in 1959 and by 1961 had ac-
cumulated a loss of £50,000. Then
onto the scene came John Lauwers and
Paul Kornmehl, directors of Kolotex
Pty Ltd. A successful takeover offer
for 75 p.c. of the capital was made.
Subsequently the assets of Kolotex Pty
Ltd were injected into Rosslyn Hosiery
and then the name was changed.
The effect was quite dramatic. In
1962, earning rate rose to 17 p.c. and
then jumped to 53 p.c. in 1963. Appar-
ently it was not enough, for the interim
report tells us of a further substantial
increase in earning rate. This year it
should be close to 100 p.c.! However,
this earning rate is not strictly compar-
able with other industrial companies. In
the last balance sheet, creditors alone
were twice the size of the issued capital.
Even allowing for the high gearing at
this stage, there should be a couple more
shillings in the shares.
The only sale this week was the very
small holding of Kay Corporation. If
the stock was going to move, it should
have shown some life in the last two
months.
Perhaps my attitude to the Budget is
too negative. Yet each stock still seems
to possess a reason for being retained in
the portfolio.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
400 Kay, 5/6 £lO5
BOUGHT
600 Kolotex, 14/3 £436
These transactions almost leave the
account square—only £l5 in credit. My
quiet approach to the market contrasts
with the rumblings on the CSR, BMI
and RMC scene. The RMC board might
be having its struggles in running the
company but it 'seems to be fairly re-
sourceful in trying to stop a takeover!
The portfolio now is:


THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Exporting Merino Rams
An effort to keep wool in the fibre race?
ban on the export of merino rams
dates from 1929 and it was brought
in, by Act of Parliament, for two rea-
sons:
• Most sheep owners, large and
small, felt that Australia ought to make
it difficult for any other country to
threaten our world monopoly.
• Most small sheep owners felt that,
if exports were allowed to continue, they
would be unable to compete with over-
seas buyers of rams and would be de-
prived of their share of the merino
wealth.
The second reason may have been the
one which carried most weight at the
time. Certainly a good number of
merino breeders opposed the embargo
then and have continued to oppose it
down the years.
Now Wool Board chief Sir William
Gunn has chosen to bring the subject
up again. He would, he says, be in
favor of lifting the embargo, provided
there was some sensible limitation on
the rate of export of rams initially.
Sir William would not want to see
Australia’s ram strength seriously de-
pleted, though he would like to see rams
go overseas so that wool’s position in
the world fibre picture would be im-
proved.
As wool must double its production in
the next twenty years to hold its
place it can now be argued, and most
logically, that what is good for the
world's wool is good for Australia’s
wool. In 1929 this did not apply, be-
cause in 1929 there was no such thing
as the threat from man-made fibres.
Gunn is inevitably going to be ac-
cused of a stratagem here —and an ex-
ceedingly clever one. He is currently
trying to win support for the Wool
Board’s reserve price plan for the selling
of wool.
Now the smaller growers—who ori-
ginally had a big hand in the provision
of the embargo, remember —are already
in favor of reserve price. But the big
growers are undecided. Some of the
biggest growers of all are the stud men.
Gunn knows, and most woolgrowers
will know, that if the industry has
marketing, promotion and research inte-
grated and working smoothly, then the
merino embargo could be lifted with
little difficulty. Otherwise there is just
no hope.
No Government could reverse an Act
of Parliament unless it was sure that
the people most vitally concerned, the
woolgrowers, were in agreement on the
matter. If woolgrowers cannot agree
on marketing, then any Government
would assume, correctly, that they could
not agree on anything else.
Moreover, the lifting of the embargo
would, of necessity, require certain safe-
guards and these could best be guided,
probably, by a body such as the Wool
Board.
Otud breeders of any four-footed ani-
mal, other than the merino sheep,
would be in a position to decide for
themselves —to export or not to export.
With merinos the picture is different,
because the biggest market would still
remain the home market. The breeders
could not afford to offend the home
market. The industry would have to be
behind the export idea.
Already some of the numerically
strong smaller grower organisations
have indicated that they might recon-
sider their official opposition to the lift-
ing of the merino export embargo. They
have not said so, but it is a fair inter-
pretation that they might do so provided
the big growers come to the party on
the matter of reserve price.
Critics who accuse Gunn of playing
politics might concede that here we have
a situation which does call for the astute
hand of the politician.
While the merino ban does not come
within the Wool Board’s marketing pro-
posal, it is clearly not unrelated to it.
Removal of the embargo does fit in to
Gunn’s idea of a wool industry organ-
ised “like any other business”.
There has been strong support for the
lifting of the embargo from breeders in
Victoria and in Tasmania. In NSW
there have been expressions of guarded
approval. Such caution is only to be
expected, as NSW is the stronghold of
most of the opposition to reserve price.
Tasmania is a special case. It is the
home of the Saxon merinos. While these
sheep played a great part in the early
development of the Australian merino,
they have, in recent times, lost much of
their influence. Many Tasmanian studs
have been dispersed and, should exports
be permitted, there would be a rebirth
of the Saxon studs in Tasmania.
The small, fine-woolled Saxons would
undoubtedly be sought by countries
wanting to build up flocks of fine-wool-
led sheep. Like the Arab horse the
Saxon merino has a great imparting
quality—yet having done his job for
the breed in Australia, it is possible that
he might disappear unless exports are
permitted.
In Victoria there would be hardly a
stud breeder who would not support lift-
ing the ban.
'VToted Victorian breeder Mr Philip
Russell, of Mawallok, Beaufort,
says the ban is a “dog in the manger
attitude which should have been scrap-
ped 25 years ago.” Mr Russell is a
member of one of the pioneer families
in the Western District. Serious students
of Australian pastoral history will be
familiar with the name through the
Clyde Company Papers.
Mr Russell says that, if the ban were
lifted, the average woolgrower would
still be able to buy his rams at a fair
price. He argues, and his view is sup-
ported by other breeders, that the buyers
from South Africa and South America,
and maybe Russia, would want top
priced rams.
The average woolgrower never does
buy these rams. Instead he buys flock
rams. The prices for these would re-
main much as they are now.
Standing at the very pinnacle of the
stud breeding world, and indeed the
entire Australian sheep industry, are the
great studs of the NSW Riverina. There
are some 130 million merinos in Aus-
tralia and they shear more than half the
world’s merino wool.
The Riverina studs will probably be
the ones which will decide the issue, for
they have the sheep the overseas buyers
will most desire—the Peppins and the
Wanganellas.
Yet here again is a complex issue. As
well as being the most powerful, and the
wealthiest of all, the Riverina studs are
really big growers of wool. In some
years the sales of stud stock might ex-
ceed the wool clip; in other years it
would be the wool clip which brought
in the most revenue to the stud pro-
perties.
One might assume that as woolgrow-
ers they might be against reserve price.
But as stud breeders, the prospects of
rich sales overseas must be very tempt-
ing.
They have also one or two troubles of
their own which have been developing

in recent years and which they seem
unable to cope with themselves.
The first of these is that an increas-
ing number of woolgrowers are buying
from the South Australian studs, where
in previous years they always came to
the Riverina. The reason is that the
South Australian merino is well suited
to improved pastures and the trend, de-
finitely, is to more and more improved
pastures. What they have lost in these
sales, and it is more a trend at the
moment than a real loss, may be
more than adequately made up by sales
to overseas buyers of rams.
The second trouble is the matter of
land resumptions and the seemingly in-
evitable succession of Labor Govern-
ments in NSW which, to put it mildly,
appear to have inherited a lands policy
straight from the 1860 s.
In NSW there have been some re-
sumptions which have clearly been dic-
tated by prejudice and sheer ignorance.
Even in this year of 1964 there are some
threatened resumptions which simply do
not make sense.
Opening the Melbourne Sheep Show
a couple of weeks ago, Sir William Gunn
must have impressed those present whose
Mercedes and Rovers in the parking lot
bore NSW number plates. There were
quite a few, actually—doubtless from
Deniliquin and beyond.
It would be tragic, Gunn said, if
certain State Governments continued to
pursue land resumption policies which
would threaten the existence of merino
studs. “We must have more wool and
we must have more top quality wool,”
he said. “We must make it clear that
land resumptions which threaten the stud
industry will, in the long run, harm the
entire country.”
The point is a good one. So good,
in fact, that it may yet be a deciding one
in the reserve price story.
What Gunn is doing now is appealing
to growers to examine the proposal as
a whole—to look at the sections devoted
to private selling, jute contamination,
lot sizes, rosters, and so on. They should
try to see the whole thing as part of an
integrated effort to keep wool in the
fibre race. Anyone who believes that
there is no need for this effort is inevit-
ably consigning the merino to a fate
similar to that of the silkworm.
The argument promises to liven up
before it subsides.
Currently putting forward a novel
suggestion are two Australian textile
manufacturers, Mr Alan Jacobson and
Mr George Foletta. They believe that
less wool should be exported and more
manufactured here into woollen goods
for export in the finished state.
Mr Jacobson says there should be a
restriction placed on the export of raw
wool so that the Australian textile indus-
try could be permitted to increase
rapidly.
One thing is certain. Woolgrowers
might have their differences, yet the
ranks would close overnight if there was
any real move by Australian textile in-
terests to appropriate a share of the raw
merino wool.
Gunn must be very pleased with the
reaction to the reserve price plan over-
seas. Even with International Wool
Secretariat chief Bill Vines close by in
London to give Bradford the hotfoot,
British wool industry opinion seems
more favorable than Gunn could have
hoped for. Said “Wool Record'’, official
organ of the industry:
“Although the Australians have
many British characteristics, they can
count themselves fortunate that they
do not prevaricate nearly so much as
we do. It follows that when an autho-
ritative Australian body—namely the
Wool Board—says that it thinks a
wool floor-price scheme would be a
good idea, it is extremely likely that a
floor-price scheme will be introduced.
After all, the Australians have already
been a good deal more equivocal about
this than is their general habit. So,
having once again gone painfully
through the tortuous logic of the pros
and cons of wool-price support and
come out in favor, they are unlikely
now to shrink from putting the recom-
mendation into practice. It remains,
then, to ask only two questions. Will
it work? And if it does, what will be
its general effect?
“The answer to the first is, we
think, a simple unqualified ‘yes’ —in
spite of certain obvious difficulties
such as ensuring uniform appraisal
over a vast area and getting together
a large enough ‘kitty’ (or credit) to
make the scheme hazard-and-doubt-
proof. It is less easy to be dogmatic
about the answer to the second ques-
tion, though here also certain reason-
able expectations suggest themselves.
The first is that the scheme should do
what is claimed for it. By which we
mean that it should ‘put a floor under’
wool.
“This will rub off the sharpest

downward-pointing extremities of the
wool-price graph—and a good thing,
too. To those who raise their eyebrows
at this view, we would say: Who can
lose in the long run by the inception
of a non-revolutionary scheme that
will provide a heavy measure of insu-
rance against the sheep following the
silk-worm into semi-retirement? Cer-
tainly not the wool-grower. And cer-
tainly not wool-merchants and pro-
cessors either. Only those rare and
relatively expendable creatures, the
experts of the short-sold position, will
shed tears about this decision. And
they will shed them privately.
Tobacco-Growing No Picnic
Strong muscles without capital not enough
rpHE angry resentment of the Italian
A tobacco-growers at the Melbourne
tobacco sales illustrates, unhappily per-
haps, a point which has been made often
in these pages.
The small primary producer with no
capital but only strong muscles has not
got a chance these days.
Allegations by the Italians that they
have been discriminated against because
of their race is plain nonsense. The hard
truth is that their tobacco is not much
good.
Indeed, one could go further and say
that, as far as the tobacco manufacturers
are concerned, all Australian tobacco is
suspect. They buy what they have to,
because the Federal Government insists
that they use a proportion of Australian
leaf. Given free choice, they would pre-
fer cheaper, and better, leaf from the
USA or South Africa.
Given a proper chance, there is good
reason to hope that eventually Australia
will be able to produce a good leaf. This
situation will not be achieved by strug-
gling, under-privileged farmers in debt up
to their necks. It will take capital and
modern farming know-how.
If the present squabble in Victoria
does result in the Italian farmers chang-
ing their minds, and seeking work in
factories in the cities, they will be better
off in the long run. That is the realistic
way to look at it.
The Italians have not been in tobacco
in Victoria long enough for a breaking
of the ties to be really difficult. A re-
direction of the energies of these im-
migrants and a more kindly attitude, per-
haps, towards their very real feeling that
an injustice has been done seems called
for.
If they are allowed to persevere they
can only end up by being exploited
sharecroppers a repugnant aspect of
farming in many overseas countries
which Australia, so far, has managed to
escape.
Increasingly it appears that the States
are unable to cope with the complex
problem of proper land utilisation and
settlement. An imaginative national lands
policy is sorely lacking.
Very few of these Italians, who farm
small tobacco acreages around Wanga-
ratta, Markwood and Whorouly, are land
owners. They have leased their acreages
from dairy-farmers and others who have
been prepared to give them a go.
The Italians, moreover, are said to be
influenced by certain of their country-
men who want to take the tobacco as
agents. This would further pull the noose
tight around the necks of the growers
who, in the main, are recent immigrants
from Calabria and other southern Italian
parts, and who have only a meagre
knowledge of Australian conditions.
They work hard. That cannot be
denied. In fact, they are prepared to
break their backs working in the fields.
Where will it get them? Not very far,
unfortunately.
It is an unhappy episode, though it
could be much worse.
Perhaps the very worst side to this
flare-up is the strong suspicion in some
quarters that many of these Italians have
been led up the not very productive
garden path by loan sharks.
Even the subsistence tobacco cropper
needs some money to buy essentials for
himself and family. Financed into a
hazardous farming venture in the first
place, the Italians now find that they owe
money to the man who met them when
the boat docked and in spite of what
the man said they find they cannot sell
their crop.
Under these circumstances it would
not be difficult for somebody to incite
these essentially decent and hardworking
migrants to near rioting in the hope that
the Government will come in and look
after them. When, and if, the Govern-
ment does that, the chances are the
simple men of the soil will be fleeced
yet again.
An investigation has been ordered by
the Victorian Government and police are
visiting the tobacco-growing areas. Indi-
cations so far are that there is a re-
luctance on the part of the farmers to
talk.
