SONNETS TO THE SPIRIT OF
BEAUTY.
.
Long, long ego, when all the glittering earth
Was Heaven itself, when drunkards in the
street
Were like mazed kings shaking at giving
birth
To acts of war that sickle men like wheat,
When the white clover opened Paradise
And God lived in a cottage up the brook,
Beauty, you lifted up my sleeping eyes
And filled my heart with longing ivitli a
look;
And all the day I searched but could not
find
The beautiful dark-eyed who touched me
there ,
Delight in her made trouble in my mind,
She was ivithin all Nature, everywhere,
The breath I breathed, the brook, the
flower, the grass,
Were her, her word, her beauty, all she
was ....
These myriad days, these many thousand
hours,
A. man’s long life, so choked with dusty
things,
How little perfect poise with perfect powers,
Joy at the heart and Beauty at the springs.
One hour, or two, or three, in long years
scattered,
Sparks from a smithy that have fired a
thatch,
Are all'that life has given and all that
mattered,
The rest, all heaving at a moveless latch.
For these, so many years of useless Toil,
Despair, endeavor, and again despair,
Sweat, that the base machine may have its
oil,
Idle delight to tempt one everywhere.
A life upon the cross. To make amends
Three flaming memories that the deathbed
ends.
There, on the darkened deathbed, dies the
brain
That flared three several times in seventy
years;
It cannot lift the silly hand again,
Nor speak, nor sing, it neither sees nor
hears.
And muffled mourners put it in the ground
And then go home, and in the earth it lies,
Too dark for vision and too deep for sound,
The million cells that made a good man wise.
Yet for a few short years an influence stirs
A sense or wraith or essence of him dead,
Which makes insensate things its ministers
To those beloved, his spirit’s daily bread;
Then that, too, fades; in book or deed a
spark
Lingers, then that, too, fades; then all is
dark ....
It may be so with us, that in the dark,
When tee have done with Time and wander
Space,
Some meeting of the blind may strike a
spark,
And to Death’s empty mansion give a grace.
Jt may be, that the loosened soul may find
Some new delight of living without limbs,
Bodiless joy of flesh-untrammelled mind,
Peace like a sky where starlike spirit swims.
It maybe, that the million cells of sense,
Loosed from their seventy years’ adhesion,
pass
Each to some joy of changed experience,
Weight in the earth or glory in the grass;
It may be that we cedse; we cannot tell.
Even if we cease life is a miracle.
From “Good Friday and Other Poems,” by
John Masefield.
Jt
The value of John Masefield’s Good Fri-
day and Other Poems (Macmillan, New
York, jis. 6d. out here), lies in the other
poems, for the dramatic poem, Good Friday,
a brilliant stage presentation of the trial
and crucifixion of Christ, appeared in print
some years ago and was adequately appre-
ciated by this page. The series of 60 son-
nets that follow contain, as will be seen
from those quoted, sonnets that deserve a
permanent place in English literature; and
the argument is logically developed from the
first exquisite sonnet to the culminating one,
to be quoted later. By this sonnet series
John Masefield ranges himself in the van
of contemporary poets, for here he has
proved himself in a medium that would at
first sight seem strange to the author of The
Everlasting Mercy and The Widow in the
Bye Street. He has taken the Shakespear-
ean form of sonnet, and shows himself some- x
what careless in his control of metre, allow-
ing in more than one line six feet, and
throughout making dissyllables of words like
“fire” and “hour”; but these minor blem-
ishes do not mar the splendid sweep of his
imagery and the sonorousness of his rhythm.

Lays and Tales of the Mines, by Arthur
Wilson (“Dairy”), published by George
Robinson, Melb., deals with “the heroic deeds
and noble sacrifices, the sore trials and long
sufferings of the workers of the mines,”
These stories are forcibly written, though
without any pretence of style. Many of
the sketches have appeared in the press.
Naturally, the author knows his subject,
and his sympathy for his mining _ mates is
everywhere apparent. The collection is an
object-lesson in fhe improvement of under-
ground conditions, due chiefly to the lesson
of the appalling'mining catastrophes that
have stained the record of mining in every
period and every country. And, in these
new days of heroism, it is well for Arthur
Wilson to remind us that in times of danger
the miner has always been a hero.

America, and the Future
Roland G. Usher, who professes history in
a U.S. University and is the author of
Pan-Germanism, now, in a remarkable work,
The Challenge of the Future (Constable, per
Sydney Book Club), takes liis country on his
professorial knee and spanks all the non-
sense out of her. She has to get out or get
under. She has to abandon the Atlantic to
Great Britain, the Pacific to Japan, confine
her famous Monroe Doctrine to the countries
between her and the Panama Canal, and ally
herself to Great Britain if she is to survive
at all. Usher insists that it does not matter
a cent what ideas the U.S. has of Europe;
the U.S. must sit up and take notice of what
Europe thinks of her; for she is “the most
completely vulnerable country to-day of any
large Power in the world.” And the desire
of America to remain isolated from the world
is quite impossible of attainment. The per-
fectly-natural aim of America that she
should be left alone to develop herself at the
maximum speed, with the cheerful hope that
the collapse of Europe will enable her to
enrich herself with even greater profits than
in the past, is also shown to be utterly
impracticable. First, even if she could go
on progressing as in the past, she would,
ipso facto, make herself a menace to other
Powers, and that menace would be met by
force. And, second, owing to her economic
inferiority to the European Powers, her
trade is going to suffer so much in the
future that she will certainly become a
poorer country, compelled to put' up with an
inevitably lessening rate of profit. There
are two kinds of trade profit, that of trading
in world markets at world prices, and that of
economic control of markets in undeveloped
countries. The former allows only a small
profit; the latter results in such abnormal
profits that “the present war is being con-
fessedly fought to retain or to obtain con-
trol” of the.se markets. “Undoubtedly, the
result will be to limit Americans to those
markets where the competition is greatest
and the profits least, to exclude them from
those markets in which competition is less
and the profits greatest.... The U.S. can
grow indefinitely, but not at the past rate
nor with the present degree of prosperity.”
As soon as Great Britain (or Germany)
re-enter the trade with South America, the
trade of the U.S. disappears, purely owing to
economic forces.
The economic reason is that the U.S. has
not yet acquired equality with England and
France, nor with the industrial development
of Germany. “There are two classes of
nations, creditor and debtor countries. On
the one hand stand Great Britain, France,
Belgium and Holland, the creditor countries,
elaborately developed from the proceeds of
their own industry. On the other we see
Germany, Austria, Italy, Russia, the U.S.
and Japan, in which the same conditions
have been produced by means of borrowed
capital apd skill. (To these we must, of
course, acid Australia.) These are the debtor
countries, which still owe the capital invest-
ments to which their great growth is really
due Those only are creditor countries
whose total assets are- greater than their
liabilities, who are owed by other nations,
and their citizens, more than they must pay
to other nations and their citizens. The
U.S. is still a debtor country.” For Usher
shows that the recent big buying back of her
securities has not by any means cleared her
from debt. Though her exports exceed her
imports the U.S. is merely paying her debts
in extra exports. And the U.S. is industrially
inferior to the best-organised European
States. “Where the price is identical the
quality is not; where the quality is the same
the American price is usually higher... .The
finer and more elaborate products of Euro-
pean industries, which constitute a large pro-
portion of the commodities exchanged
between nations, we are not yet able to make
at all in competition with Europe....We
have not yet learned to compete in quality,
promptitude, accuracy and efficiency with the
great European nations.” And the U.S. is
not able to undertake direct trade with many
countries, because she is not able to utilise
sufficient quantities of the raw products
which those countries export, nor to ex-
change sufficient quantities of her own manu-
factured goods of the desired quality.
Americans will have to think internation-
ally, to think in terms of Europe, not. of
America. “The assumption that we are iso-
lated from Europe in any sense, that our
safety and prosperity rest primarily upon
factors existent in America and are pro-
tected by our territorial integrity, is a
fallacy of the most dangerous type.” It
depends solely upon the other (European)
fellow whether America is going to get it in
the neck—that is, if she persists in being
too proud to fight. “We shall retain only
what the other nations cannot take away
from us, what they do not value, what they
will voluntarily concede.... The real danger
lies in the determination of European
nations to create by the use of armed force
artificial conditions to their own advantage
in practically all the undeveloped countries
on the globe.” And if the other nations do
more business and receive more profit, the
U.S. will do less and receive less. And it is
well to remember that the abnormal growth
of the U.S. has been due to the protection of
the sea-Power, Great Britain. It .was Britain
that stood between Europe aiid America
when America could not protect herself.
“In reality America is economically de-
pendent upon Europe, can remain isolated
only if Europe allows hex*. European ambi-
tions and not American interests govern the
international situation, and so long as their
economic fabric is so much stronger and
better organised than ours, they may coerce
us by economic methods at will.” And if the
U..g. attempts by armament to become inde-
pendent of Europe, Europe can be depended
upon to deal with the U.S. as the Allies are
now dealing with Germany. But, as Usher
shows, American independence is inexpedi-
ent. The victors in this war are not in the
least likely to share their winnings—the
control of the most profitable markets —with
any outsider, unless that Power is strong-
enough to demand them. Thus Usher is led
to the conviction that it is absolutely neces-
sary for the U.S. to make a European
alliance. And the U.S. can come into the
European ‘Concert only on the European
terms. For, judged by international status,
the U.S. ranks below Belgium. And_ there
can be no “preposterous and impertinent”
notion of the U.S. joining the European
Powers in order to lead them. Europe is
more than able to look after herself, and the
world. So America’s only chance is an
alliance with Great Britain, in which the
benefits each party received would be
approximately balanced.
But the U.S. must withdraw from the
Pacific. Usher makes out a strong case.
America must sacrifice the ‘Philippines,
Hawaii, and her coaling stations to Japan,
not only because she is unable to hold
these places, but also because it is highly
inexpedient that she should try to hold them.
Japan does not want to colonise the Pacific
Coast of the U.S., since she could not hope
to stay there. “The Japanese would be lack-
ing in sanity to establish colonies 8000 miles
away when admirable opportunities already
exist on the Asiatic shores which are already
in her control. In Korea and Manchuria
will be the New Japan, and, if additional
territory is eventually needed....”
Among other inevitable sacrifices are an
American mercantile marine and most of the
Monroe Doctrine. The only sphere of influence
that belongs to the U.S. is the Gulf and the
country as far south as the Canal —though
Usher notes that so far the U.S. has held the
canal solely by permission of the sea-Power,
England. It will be the job of the
U.S. to police Mexico and Central America,
and that will need something more tha'n a
toy army. “Certainly Great Britain, France
and Germany will not much longer tolerate
our attempts to produce order in other ways.”
Usher even suggests that when the European
war ends, the Mexican * clean-up might
furnish useful employment for the left-over
armies. In conclusion, while Usher almost
despondently recognises the difficulties in the
way of any adequate preparedness in a
nation that is not yet a nation, he logically
pleads for a beginning on that tremendous
task of national defence. But he insists
that the very life of the U-S. depends upon
an immediate consummation of “the - indis-
pensable foreign alliance”—and all his argu-
ment shows that that ally must be Great
Britain.
A. H. A.
With approximately the speed of the new
British armored “Willies,” Fredk. Watson is
deliberately and ponderously traversing our
early history in his series of Historical
Records of Australia, of which the latest is
vol. VII. of the first series, published by the
Library Committee of the Commonwealth
Parliament. This heavily-armored volume of
900 pages consists of governor’s despatches
to and from England during the period Jan.,
1809-June, 1813. The despatches are chiefly
those of William Paterson. Paterson did
some good service in exploration; but other-
wise left little mark on the settlement. He
had his full share in the troubles caused by
the sale of rum; and he will perhaps be re-
membered chiefly because of his duel with
Macarthur. His administration of the
settlement at Port Dahymple, in Tasmania,
gave no evidences of efficiency. After the
disposition of Bligh, Paterson, solely by
virtue of his military seniority,_assumed the
government of the colony. “His influence,”
says Fredk. Watson, “was purely adminis-
trative He was purely a passive figure-
head, and the little mark that he has left
was made by his encouragement of explora-
tion and his enlargement of the knowledge
of natural history in the two colonies.” Since,
in pursuance of Fredk. Watson’s elaborate
plan, he finds it necessary to devote 900
pages of correspondence to this nonentity, it
must be evident that these volumes are not
history but merely the dull bones that some
historian of our future may possibly gal-
vanise into life.
“Henry Janies James” : An English edition
of my Double-Bed Dialogues has been pub-
lished by Nash, at 3s. Gd. For the English
reader, however, it bears a different title
and a different signature. In neither case
am I to blame. The London publisher pre-
ferred the less shocking title. Honeymoon
Dialogues, for his less sophisticated readers.
And, owing to the death of Henry James, he
asked me to dispense with my first name, in
case purchasers of the Dialogues might won-
der what high explosive had strafed that
great novelist’s famous style. Hence, for the
English public, lam James James. And
now my agents have sold the Swedish pub-
lishing* rights— So Babette will have to

Billzac
Tall or short, lie is always lean, slim,
tough as whipcord, bearing himself with
perfect assurance and a certain degree of
athletic grace. He has a quick glancing eye,
a sun-tinted skin, and a thin mouth, cigar-
ette-adorned. That mouth is the label of his
wit and readiness to laugh at the comedy he
finds or invents in all things. He prefers Ms
humor served either well-flavored or with a
whimsical twist; the too-obvious horse-play
style of wit does not generally appeal. Con-
ventional reverence is not his strong point,
evidenced by the fact of his huge enjoyment
of any joke concerning the Almighty and the
After-Life.
In temperament he approximates more
closely to the Celt than to the Anglo-Saxon.
He is impulsive, quick-witted, generous, and
beneath that careless and no-sentiment-about-
me exterior lies an innate love of music,
color, life and movement. His blood, as one
might expect from the mothering of the
warm South, is red and hot, and his sins
are those of commission. Quick and strong
are his affections, too, deep-rooted but well-
hidden —so well-hidden that many doubt their
existence. His generous use of slang and
“langwidge” is really due to this same dis-
like of showing his true feelings. “Die before
you appear sentimental or pedantic” is cer-
tainly one rule that governs the general
behavior of Billzac.
Friendship is Billzac’s forte. Of mates he
is the most true, loyal and generous. But he
is a man’s man —-in men’s society he finds
true relaxation and enjoyment. Lay the
unflattering unction to thy soul, O Woman
of the Southland! Sport, in which thou hast
no place, is in reality the darling idol of his
heart. He dearly loves woman’s companion-
ship—occasionally. The quality of his love
for his mate usually transcends in strength,
purity and loyalty his love for the woman he
admires. .
He is a born rebel, with a deep dislike to
any rigidity Of discipline and order. Still,
the rebel is deeply tinged with a fierce sense
of possession. Attack his own particular in-
stitution —be it •‘push,” profession, State or
country—and he will fight like a very devil
to vindicate its. honor, forgetful of his quon-
dam resistance to its authority.
Perhaps, however, the most outstanding
characteristic appertaining to Billzac is liis
utter democracy—his lack of reverence for
the powers that be. His superior officer in
any rank of life is only superior in so far as
his age, experience or greater advantage have
piloted him to a higher position. Billzac per-
sists in seeing the man very much like him-
self —behind the veneer of office, and, seeing,
refuses to be overawed or impressed by his
authority.
Lastly, let me complete my miniature im-
pression of Billzac by painting in a super-
vivid tone of sheer personal courage and
contempt of danger and physical suffering.
—Helen Burke.
Jt
He is tall and wiry and bronzed, and he
swears in between his slang. There is
laughter in his eyes—they suggest the sun-
light of his native land. He will cheekily
compare London with Yackandandah to
the advantage of Yackandandah. He pro-
claims his independence in his walk, and hav-
ing something to skite about he does so.
He tells his occasional enemy to go to Hades,
but his mortal foe —well, he sends him
there. There is no gush about Billzac. “Not
Bad” is his superlative. Religion lie takes
casually (he has a nodding acquaintance
with God, so to speak), but deep in his
heart is a reverence for things that are good
and true. That is why he is a Billzac. And
he will back a team or a horse or a dog
with his last coin because that is in him too.
J. D. C.
Philadelphia N. Robertson issues An Ansae
Budget and O.V. (Australasian Authors
Agency, Melb., Is.)- But shouldn’t the use
of “Anzac” in a title be the privilege only
of those who are themselves Anzacs? The
verses that the author enclosed in a Christ-
mas billy are rather silly, but doubtless would
be welcomed by the recipient. Among the
other verses, which are on the whole unpre-
tentious but sincere, there is only one that
is worth quoting :
I am so placid as I sit
In train or tram, and knit and knit;
I walk serenely down the street
And smile on all the friends I meet;
Within the house I give due heed
To every duty, each one's need,
And when it’s dark and lamps are hit,
I take my sock again, and knit.
Sometimes the newsboys hurry by
And then my needles seem to fly
Through purl and plain, rote after row ,
They flash, until the fire burns low—
I am so tranquil as 1 sit
Till bedtime conies, and knit and knit.
And when the house has grown quite still,
I lean out on my window-sill —
Lean out to the velvet night,
Gemmed with ail its points .of light,
And pray to God to see to it
That I keep sane enough to knit.
It seems curious that a poet who can reach
this poignant sincerity should nowhere else
in this little booklet equal this high emotion.

still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

MR. T. I. CAMPBELL,
General Secretary Farmers 8 Settlers’ Associaticn of New South Wales,
one of the best-known of Sydney'.: commercial citizens, having held this important
position for years, gives this voluntary testimony to Clements Tonic, because he
states it merits it: —
“Farmers and Settlers’ Association, N.S.W.,
“7 O’Connell St., Sydney, 27/7/’l6.
“CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.,
“Knowing the value of Clements Tonic from personal use and
experience, I do not hesitate to give you my opinion of it, simply
putting into words what I have so often spoken.
“I believe it to be a very fine blood and nerve tonic. I know
that it has benefited me greatly. At various periods my duties are
exceptionally heavy, involving great mental and nervous strain, and
I have always found your medicine of the greatest value to me,
having singularly invigorating and recuperative properties.
“I make a point of recommending Clements Tonic to many of
my friends, as I feel desirous of enabling others to benefit by my
personal experience.
“(Signed) T. I. CAMPBELL,
“General Secretary.”
It is questionable whether there is any man better or more widely known than the able
Secretary of this far-reaching Association, the influence of which extends over the entire State,
and whose members amongst the pastoral and farming communities of New South Wales are
to be numbered in thousands. To ail of these Mr. Campbell’s letter will appeal, as equally
as it will to his numberless commercial city friends, because of its sincerity and lucid explana-
tion of the worth of a medicine the effectiveness of which is felt and recognised throughout
the Australian Commonwealth.
It is truly the medicine for the man on the land. Send for it if you suffer
from Insomnia, Poor Appetite, Weak Nerves, or Brain Fag. ALL CHEMISTS.

RHEUMATISM
Its Cause—and Cure.
Rheumatism is caused by a curious,
poisonous acid in the blood. This acid, just
like tiny pieces of broken glass with rough
edges, settles in the joints and muscles and
causes that awful agonising pain of back-
ache, rheumatism and gout, gravel, and the
burning sensation of inflammation of the
bladder, etc.
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills
strengthen the kidneys and drive the
poisonous pain-causing acid right out of the
system.
To cure rheumatism or any other form of
kidney trouble you must positively get rid
of the cause —the poisonous uric acid.
Remember to do this a real remedy must
pass through the kidneys and the bladder
and not through the bowels, as most kidney
pills do. When you see the urine change to
a muddy bluish color—a feature which dis-
tinguishes De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder
Pills from all others —you know beyond all
doubt that they have put their healing
touch on the right spot—the kidneys and
the bladder. A wonderful pill—straight to
the kidneys—that is why De Witt’s pills
give such amazingly quick relief —every
time. A permanent cure follows in almost
every case. Look for that blue-colored urine.
Don’t waste a single hour. Go to your
chemist at once and ask him for a 2s. 9d.
box of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills,
which are made expressly for kidney and
bladder troubles.
They will cure every one of the above
symptoms no matter how long or how badly
you have suffered.

When thou art old
And sit beside the fire,
Past dreams and thoughts will come to
thee
To stir long dead desire. ■
Then shall be fought again
Of battles long, long gone.
But thou shalt sharpen sorrow
On the good things left undone.
When thou shalt see
The candle flicker low,
Passing, afar in shadow,
Will a dim procession go—•
Friends who were friends;
Friends who were none.
But thought will sharpen sorrow
On the good things left undone.
When on the roof
Shalt hear th' insolent rain
(Clamorous as thy youth
That scattered chaff for grain),
Thou slnilt half-smile
Remembering dreams won.
But sorrow will be sharpened
For the good things left undone.

Confessional.
The flowing waters sluice the shingle,
The white beach, shaped like a crescent
moon.
Stretches for westering miles to mingle
Scarping headland and crouching dune,
In the soft distance yellowed, mellowed
By the lifting vapors of afternoon.
Oh. wist o’ me, O woman of yearning.
Beckoning there from the outland bar.
The lore you taught I was slow in learning,
Though Love, perhaps, is. as seabirds are,
Touched with wildness- —the more my debt,
then,
I who was fretful that small things jar.
I as a worm have revelled in mire,
Grappled ’ the sun and laughed that it
burned;
Have made debauch with draggled Desire,
And still to the thing that I scorned
returned;
Held Life a vassal, a whimsy plaything.
This you accepted, this you discerned.
Nor made rebuke, full understanding
That what has been had the need to be,
Since froward man to his own demanding
Brooks no withholding of ample fee,
Minting coin of his own red mintage,
Heedless of aught than his will’s decree.
Yet knew, beneath the brave veneering.
What wistful dreams of you there were,
Iu spite of my vagabond wayfaring,
Knew of the ferment working there,
And knew, at the last, they would lead me
safely
Home to your heart and the end of care.
Here to the music of waters lipping
The shingly beach in a soft sea rune.
With the seagulls planing, wheeling, dipping
Through the vapory splendors of afternoon,
Mellowing yet to a richer glory
Scarping headland and crouching dune,
Love, anhumbled and truly meting
How small the triumphs that father Pride,
I proffer my holiest dreams in greeting,
So I, through them, may be deified—
By your acceptance, or by your spurning,
Be outcast wholly, as you decide!

Now hold me close a little trembling space,
While water-lilies bloom beneath the moon
And fragrant is the earth of dew-drenched

Steeped in a drowsy white and golden swoon,
Shaken of love —there is no faintest breeze
Upon the breast of the swift-lipped lagoon.
Ah, hold me close! The quick buds on the
trees
Tremble to life, their blooming time is near,
The surging creek runs singing to the seas.
The night a censer is, swung high and clear,
Flinging to Heav’n the incense of the earth,
The wedded fragrance of the fruitful year.
Ah, hold me close! Love clamors to have
birth.
Great golden stars lean from the skies
a-croon,
And water-lilies faint beneath the moon.

Truth lias a well; its water feeds
A shelving edge of tangled weeds;
And, on the brink, full many sit
Whose questing feet have muddied it.
There came a youth with face aflame;
It matters not his rank or name;
He viewed with scorn the thronging crowd ;
“Oh, sophists vain!” he cried aloud,
“The Truth -is not the thing you think—
This muddied water on the brink ;
“It lies far out from banks arrayed
With tangled reeds and lying shade.
“In shallow pools you weaklings creep;
But in its w r ell the Truth lies deep!
“Too deep for you to care about;
But I —yes, I —will seek it out!”
He climbed upon a shelving height,
Then, plunging, disappeared from sight.
He came not back. They say the youth
Was drowned. Perchance, he found the
Truth!

The Story of the Lamp
SIS
The Modern Hurricane Lamp
With the improvement made in the
designing of house lamps, out-door lamps
kept apace. The demand for a lamp that
would stay alight in the strongest gale,
resulted in the “hurricane” lamp, the “Rayo”
representing the highest standard to which
these lamps have attained.
To get the clear, steady flame required
in all kinds of lamps, no finer kerosene
can be used than
Laurel Kerosene
The soft white light
It neither smokes nor smells and is free
from sediment. By using Laurel your
wicks are kept clean and last longer. The
last thimbleful burns as well as the first.
For lighting, heating and cooking.it cannot
be excelled. Laurel is our new trade mark
name for the highest quality American
Kerosene ever sold in Australasia and

IS WHITE AUSTRALIA WORTH
DOING ANYTHING FOR EXCEPT
TALK?
One of the yells raised by the opponents of
reinforcing the army was this: —
Are you prepared to break down the barriers that
keep Australia white? Are you prepared to see our
beloved country submerged by an inrush of that
“colored ocean” by which Mr. Hughes himself has
warned us that we are surrounded ? That is the
question you are called on to decide. Conscript all
our white men....and either we must behold our
industries perish and the remnants of our popula-
tion starve, or we must import colored labor,
jeopardise our racial integrity, and give up the
cherished ideal of a great white nation enthroned
in the Pacific.
It was not an ineffective yell either. Many
people heard it. In a sense The Bulletin
can find no reason to regret that the colored-
labor question should exercise a strong influ-
ence on the minds of Australian citizens.
To them the question is vital. Yet this
has been sorry to see the very just
‘apprehensions of the people played upon by
a string of words which in the circumstances
of the hour were maddeningly irrelevant to
the problem they helped to confuse. The
nation’s army is locked in deadly struggle
with an enemy; and the argument was that
this army must be allowed to waste away in
order to maintain a ludicrously ineffective
defence against danger which would arrive
with a bang if the enemy pulled out a
winner. It looks more like a shriek for a
straight waistcoat than a sane contribution
to controversy. But of course the argument
was not seriously put forward. It was
merely howled into the atmosphere much
in the same way as thousands of demented
individuals burst into braggart song when
the war started and bitterly reviled every-
one who ventured to remark that the pro-
ceedings might last more than two or three
weeks. Yet, though there is no arguing
with a yell, there are a few things that
require saying about colored labor, and a
few which the Labor party and the other
party and conscriptionists and antis ought
to take into consideration. And the first of the
things that need saying is this : the coolie can
be a product of peace just as readily as of
war, and in this paper’s judgment Borrow
and Bloat and Shirk and Loaf have always
been formidable menaces to a White Aus-
tralia. The success of the policy of Borrow
and Bloat is not to be judged by the super-
ficial events of a year or two, but by the
foundation on which it rests. If there is
anyone who thinks that the white-ants have
not been at work on this foundation, then
such an individual carries his eyes under his
hat.
* # * #
The case for a White Australia is partly
racial and partly economic. It is easy to
prove that the mixture of white and colored
races is undesirable. Colored peoples know
this as well as the whites, but the dangers
of such mixtures have often enough in the
world’s history been accepted because of a
real or assumed economic necessity, and
repented of in misery and degradation after-
wards. It is easy to show also that the
exploitation of the colored man’s labor is
as indefensible morally as exploitation of the
white man ; that cheap labor is a bad invest-
ment in comparison with labor that has
reached a higher standard of living; that
white labor is more effective, productive and
reliable than the labor of the colored helot.
But there is a qualification to this, and it is
that white labor must perform its job—-that
it shall be economically productive. And
this paper p,uts it without equivocation to
the citizens of Australia that unless the
industries of the Commonwealth are carried
on by white men after the war with an
honest intention of fulfilling the obligations
involved in the White Australia policy, they
will find themselves driven by the stern
consequences of their long shirk and criminal
reliance on loans and imports to get others
to do what they had not the wit to see they
should do for their own salvation. White
Australia is not a mere yell, though a lot
if people think it is. There can be as much
."dither about it as about anything else, and
Heaven alone knows what the possibilities
of blither on any given subject really are.
Thousands of men are ready to talk in a
loose way about a White Australia being
worth fighting for. How many are there
who realise that a White Australia is worth
working for—worth being made the corner
stone of a public policy that will hand on to
the -Australian kid something better than a
record of wasted time and a staggering load
of debt, contracted so that cash might be
bartered for votes? This paper is regret-
fully compelled to say that it is convinced
there have been more politicians toiling in
Australia to create conditions favorable to
the birth of a new demand for coolie labor
than there have been statesmen working to
create conditions that would make coolie
labor.an impossible contingency.
Talk is not one of the barriers that will
keep Australia white. Wind will never keep
the coolie away. It is only by populating
Australia, living on the produce of the
country and getting rid of the twin curses
of foreign debt and dependence on foreigners
for goods, that the ambition to keep white
will have a dog’s chance of survival in the
generations to come. Borrow and Bloat
and Loaf mean the perversion of the healthy
ideals of the past: if they have not already
destroyed the sense of obligation to work
for Australia’s future, they have at least
seriously impaired it. How many of the
men who have been using “White Australia”
as an excuse for making the Commonwealth
look contemptible in the eyes of her allies
at a moment when the nation’s very life is
trembling in the scales have ever raised
their voice" in protest against the policies
of squander and log-rolling evasion that have
disgraced our democracy of recent years?
None, so far as this paper knows; and the
tragedy of the thing is that their opponents
have been as somnolently indifferent as they.
But if any. of them imagine that “White
Australia” is a mere shibboleth they are
mad.. The day it degenerates into that cate-
gory the next stage will be easily reached.
There is a constructive side to the White
Australia policy. It has been, and is now.
being systematically neglected. Indeed, it
has been worse than neglected. There is a
poison for that policy; and loanmongers and
bloaters and land jobbers and loafers of
every sort have been mixing it in tons. To
say that compulsory service involves aban-
doning the ideal of a white nation is silly.
But a White Australia living on imported
goods acquired by foreign loans and leaning
up against Cohen for a job is having a
gamble with its very soul.

LEARNING FROM THE BARBARIAN.
When the Greek met the Roman for the
first time in Southern Italy the contempt of
the cultivated person from the /Egean for
his enemy was supreme. He was the bar-
barian. the person who knew nothing of
Hellenic art or idealism, whose low mind
ran in the direction of law, military fitness
and orderly routine. He could not make
poetry or enjoy the drama or appreciate
sculpture or even speak the Greek language
with accuracy. Therefore he was of no
account; and being of no account the
superior race could learn nothing from b_im
even in a military way. For lack of the
latter lesson the Greeks, even with the aid
of the best general of the times and picked
troops from Epirus, got walloped to a stand-
still. There is always a danger of that sort
of thing happening, and an under-estimate
of the enemy based on some phase of his
character is as bad an error as any nation
can fall into. The German brute, ravishing,
destroying, murdering, sating his foul lust in
sweet old-world villages and historic minster
towns, tills us with a loathing and horror
which demands satisfaction in his defeat and'
ruin; but this mood of decent and righteous
indignation should not blind us to the patent
facts upon which a lot of his strength is
based. Making all allowances for his secret
purpose, his years of preparation, his defi-
ance of international laws and conventions
and certain elements of luck which at times
have helped him out, the German does show
a marvellous grip and tenacity and a mar-
vellous faith in himself. So far, too, he has
kept his end up astonishingly well ; and
while we hope that his smash is not far off,
what he has already achieved is sufficiently
remarkable to make us look for the points
he can show us in nation-building, while
repudiating the purpose behind them and the
character of the man himself.
* * * *
Already, on the military side, most that
he had to teach has been pretty thoroughly
learned by his three big opponents, England,
France and Russia. But mere military
arrangements are not the only factors that
enable a nation to stand the bitter test of
war. Underlying these are other things that
count for a lot even in the actual carnage.
First may be placed the notion of German
•civilisation as held by the common soldier
in the ranks. We sum up all things Teuton
in the scornful word “Ivultur.” But the
contrast of the rigid German lines of
development with the better and sweeter
ideals of the allied nations does not dispose
of the plain facts that Germany was better
in her home deeds than in her theory of
things, and that two at least of the
Allies were lame enough in their efforts
to reach after any sort of ideal. The
common Teuton soldier knows that before
the war the Fatherland stood to him for a
lot of comfort. While the slums of England
howled aloud to Heaven and those of Sydney
shouted plague curses at every Fat thing they
saw, Germany had cleaned up most of her
cities and looked after her people with
thoroughness and sympathy. This may or
may not have been done with the idea of
getting capable soldiers for the coming war;
but whether Fritz has now paid too high
a price for the conditions under which he
once lived or not, the memory of those con-
ditions remains with him in the muddiest
and bloodiest trench, to easily convince him
that German aggression means gain -to the
world.
Again, in the matter of popular education,
the German system of trade and technical
schools gave the people a big lift. It may be
that these institutions were merely adjuncts
tp the military hopes of the national leaders.
If so, the success attained was out of all
proportion to the incentive. The Teuton did,
as a plain fact, score enormously in the ways
of trade and industry through superiority of
knowledge. His natural advantages were not
great, yet he built up a huge commerce, and
seized business advantages in a manner only
possible where practical knowledge is
wedded to patience and skill. The German
peace organisation was far-reaching ; and if
peace was regarded in some quarters as
merely a foundation for war, such a know-
ledge must have been pretty well confined to
military circles. To the average German
the thing looked good ; and to a very high
point it was good, if certain antiquated
rorces with a modern edge on them had not
come down from the Middle Ages to spoil
things. But the score in favor of Germany
went farther than municipalism, education
and organisation. In some respects the Ger
man Empire was about the freest country in
Europe. Of political freedom the people had
little enough, though those in power contrived
to make them believe that they had a lot;
but within very wide limits personal liberty
had a good run. Though the Prussian home
might be as rigid as a Scottish Auld Lichts
manse, over the greater part of Germany
there was a fat, heavyweight toleration of
others’ views and practices which made the
citizen feel that he was his own man. The
wowser didn’t exist; beer was regarded as
desirable; the band played very good music.
The military heels clicked uneasily, but
llans was fully persuaded that he had a
very good time. He talked Socialism over
his pipe, but the subject was pretty much an
academic one. and he didn’t feel in the least
like fighting for principles whose acceptance
would leave only a minor effect on the daily
sausage. In a word, all the time that the
Essen factories were hammering out big guns
the prevailing note in Teuton domestic life
was one of content.
* * * *
Of course, against all this there is a lot to
put in the debit column. The condition of
Germany was at no point ideal; but she had
something to teach us, and something that
we are fools if we are unwilling to learn.
The very simple and obvious fact that a
decent city can produce better fighting men
than a rookery of slums is worth noting as
much for defence purposes as for aggression.
The plain truth that trade education makes
for commercial advantage may be generally
accepted ; but Australia at least is not losing
much perspiration in her endeavors to put
it into practice. National organisation, too,
has its advantages in making the nation
richer, more comfortable and every way more
efficient; but, so far. our statesmen appear
to think that it is merely a meaningless
phrase to use occasionally in public speeches.
And the wide, individual liberty that makes
for a kindly outlook and a good conscience is
also a thing worth thinking about. With all
his crimes thick about him, the German has
still quite a reasonable amount to teach us.
We can be debtor to the barbarian as well as
to the Greek, and only a blockish vanity
stands in the way of our learning. Because
of some things that really matter, the Ger-
man has held, his own until now with aston-
ishing fortitude and resource. Because of
those other things that the world would be
glad to forget, he is going to get the great
licking of the ages.
POLLUTING THE SACRED THING.
Judging by the recent Referendum cam-
paign, the biggest of all dangers to demo-
cracy is organised party. Neither king nor
emperor nor the uncrowned despot who
JTom time to time rises by the popular will
and causes the theoretical democrat to
gnash his teeth, is so subversive of ordered
human liberty as the machine which modern
representative government has evolved, and
which is seen in all its strength in Aus-
tralian politics. Anything which makes any
citizen or any representative of the citizens
act in any possible case against his own
conscience and judgment is destructive of
democracy. The whole theory of democratic
government is based on the idea that the
citizen will act honestly if given his full
electoral freedom. He may act foolishly or
hastily, but that is not dangerous to the
community in any acute sepse; for the great
bulk of popular opinion, if clean and out-
spoken, will make for wisdom, and the deep
instincts of men in the mass are generally
right. The danger is that .citizens for some
imaginary advantage over other citizens
may join hands to defeat what they really
believe to be their own best interests; and
the moment this point is reached democracy
becomes a mockery, and despotism takes its
place. The despotism may for the moment
be the despotism of the machine, but it soon
becomes the despotism of the men behind
the machine; and the natural transition
from this to the rule of the autocrat
clothed with arbitrary power is easy. Once
men realise that their democratic freedom is
gone they look for a strong man to save
them, with the inevitable result that a
C/ESAi;. a Napoleon or a Diaz comes along
and really gives the people a better show
than they had under the distorted forms of
democracy.
* * * *
Australia is in grave danger in this
respect, for her democracy is seriously tram-
melled, and individual freedom of opinion is
no longer the factor that it might be in
national affairs. Parties there must be, for
the grouping together of men of like opinion
is naturalbut the machines called party
organisations in Australia group together
men of unlike opinions, and force con-
sciences to bend to what is thought to be
party expediency. Australia has witnessed
the spectacle of two parties in Federal poli-
tics each with a majority in its own ranks
in favor of a -certain reform and each
humbly bowing to the will of its own
minority and sinking a question which was
of first importance to the Commonwealth.
Had the parties been real and the cleavage
along natural lines, the reform would at
once have taken its place in the forefront
of the political battle; but the two machines,
which from their very nature can have no
real concern for any reform, betrayed the
people of a continent to its continual shame
and loss. As against such sham party
organisation the great principle of the Refer-
endum has offered to the democracy a means
of escape from its servitude by a return to
that primal government in which the free
elector’s voice must be supreme above all
mechanical combines and give real expres-
sion to the nation’s will; but the _ party
engineers, alive to the danger of their own
extinction, have stepped in and made a deter-
mined attempt to nobble the Referendum
itself, warp it from its true intent and make
it serve their own plan of keeping demo-
cracy under the wdieels of the machine.
When the recent Referendum was autho-
rised it was understood that a free expres-
sion of Australian opinion was the one
thing to be desired. That the matter should
be fully discussed and debated was in every
way desirable. All possible light was
required on the question. Thought, senti-
ment, emotion and prejudice had a clear
title to find fullest expression. Only in such
a way could the will of the nation be abso-
lutely known. The matter was referred to
the people and was at once by that refer-
ence beyond the scope of party and the
party machine. But the engineers were not
willing to leave it at that. Such a Refer-
endum, once successfully conducted, must
be the death-knell of their own unholy sys-
tem. Instantly the machine was set in motion
to persecute and injure those who held a
particular view, to discredit them with the
people who had looked upon them as com-
rades and leaders, and to coerce them, if
possible, into silence lest the weight of their
arguments should convince the public. All
this was a plain crime against democracy,
and the persons guilty of it by their act
ranged themselves definitely on the side of
the tyrants and bigots of all ages who
imagined that the torch of freedom could
be blown out if the forced draught were
sufficiently strong. Side by side with such
practices citizen liberties could not exist.
The engineers and wire-pullers had no desire
that they should exist.
* * * *
The direct appeal to the people by Refer-
endum must be regarded as the most sacred
of all our political institutions, and to
tamper with the free opinion behind it is the
democratic shame of shames. In the case of
the vote recently taken all this was intensi-
fied by the question on which the people
were asked to give their voice. It con-
cerned the whole future of the Australian
race —perhaps, in as far as it was a lead to
other democracies, the whole destiny of
Man. The political leaders and the Parlia-
ment of the nation deliberately took from
their own shoulders the burden of so great
a responsibility and left it to the people
intimately concerned to decide for them-
selves. Under such circumstances, every
feeling of honor, honesty and good citizen-
ship suggested that the party organisations
should also stand aside and leave the field
of thought and conscience absolutely free.
The voting at such a Referendum partook
of the nature of a religious act. But to the
party machiAist nothing is sacred except his
job; and from the moment that the great
decision began to be clearly considered by
the Australian citizen, the machine’s full
force was employed to warp and twist the
national thought and lash the weak-minded
or uncertain into line with an alleged pro-
gramme of the party. If such practices and
the spirit behind them could prevail, demo-
cracy is dead. The Referendum is its last
great defence —a defence that cannot be
captured by frontal attack, but may be
sapped and mined while its defenders are
unaware of the danger. The party machinist
has made representative government a
mockery. It is up to the people of Aus-
tralia to cry a loud “Hands off!” when the
same unclean person attempts to lay a
destroying fist on the great, simple principle
of the appeal to the nation.

THE NEW AUSTRALIA THAT WASN’T
SO GOOD AS THE OLD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Twenty-three years ago William Lane
and his band of enthusiasts shook the social
sins of Australia off their feet and sailed
from Sydney in the Royal Tar with the idea
of establishing a kind of New Jerusalem in
Paraguay, the reputed Land of the Eternal
Siesta. The pilgrims soon discovered that
life and labor in the S. American montes was
not conducive to that brotherly love and con-
cord which is essential if the New Jeru-
salem is to develop into a going concern.
The history of the outside troubles and
internal dissensions \yhich led to the aban-
donment of the communistic ideal has been
given world-wide publicity, and much politi-
cal capital has been manufactured by anti-
Socialist writers out of the hardships,
struggles and dissensions of the pioneers.
One “pioneer,” who had spent a few
months iu New Australia, compiled a book
about 50 per cent, of which consisted of
arguments of people directly opposed to the
principles which New Australia and Cosine
represented. Possibly the hard graft and
harder tack which usually accompany pio-
neering struck a chill to the marrow of this
gently-nurtured youth fresh from the flesh-
pots of Public School and Old World civilisa-
tion, and in his modest little compilation he
made the most of the harrowing details. He
was particularly entertaining when he started
to dissect Cosine, particularly as he was
never on Cosme. He was so eager to boost
his side of the argument that he endeavored
to make it appear that the people of Cosme
were an aggregation of gaunt, starved
wretches who, in frenzied devotion to their
communistic creed, forgetting God and their
country, prowled through swamp and monte
foaming imprecations against capital and
civilisation, living on the monkeys, monte
cats and armadillos, which they killed with
their bare hands and devoured raw. The
contagion of this stinking tripe spread so
that yon meet people who firmly believe that
the inhabitants of New Australia and Cosme
have degenerated into a community of white
niggers living in hollow logs and gibbering
Socialistic platitudes at the passing stranger.
Let us get to the solid truth about these
settlements.
Those who remained on New Australia
when William Lane and his followers
seceded and founded Cosme soon abandoned
their communist principles, and each man
vas allotted a portion of the communal
lands and certain grazing rights. Under
the conditions obtaining in this part of
1 araguay the only paying spec, is cattle-
raising. The New Australians wisely
devoted their energies to this business,
doing little or nothing in the way of
agriculture or working the valuable timber
in their montes The men who took stock-
taking on are to-day, almost without ex-
ception, comfortably off, some of them own-
ing as many as 400 or 500 head of cattle.
On the other hand, the people of Cosme
depended on the cultivation of sugar, maize,
mandioca, tobacco, coffee and bananas and
\i*i development of their timber resources.
Although they worked harder than the New
Australians they have not done so well in
a financial sense, as, owing to bad markets
and worse transport facilities, all their pro-
duce except timber, sugar, maize and tobacco
was practically valueless except for home
use. But they are far from being in as bad
case as they are represented to be. Poor
they are, but as hardy, independent and
self-respecting a community as can be met
with between the Poles. They have not “for-
gotten God or their country”; neither have
they forgotten themselves. Although but a
remnant of the stalwarts who sailed from
Australia in the Royal Tar in pursuit of All
Desire, only to be disillusioned within a few
weeks of their arrival in the Promised Land,
these people have remained steadfast to their
color-principles, though hemmed in on every
side by an Indian people with the morals of
monkeys and the progressive ideas of a sloth.
They have jealously preserved their national-
ity, language, system of education, manners
and customs, and when I went among them I
felt that I w r as at home in the Australian
bush of my boyhood.
But there is no future for these people in
Paraguay—nothing except a life of hard,
unremunerative toil and an exile’s grave.
They have seen their hoped-for Utopia fail
and dissolve into nothingness, but they still
face life gamely and resolutely, and, in the
teeth of almost insuperable difficulties, live
in the hope that they may one day be able to
return to their native land. But if this is
dependent on their own slender resources
they will all leave their bones in Paraguay
and their children will be lost to Australia.
The present population of Cosme is 12
men, nine _women, 28 biJys and 1G girls, a
total of 65 souls. There is nothing from
which you can better judge the burning
patriotism of this little community than this:
it has sent 16 of its boys to the Front. This
probably constitutes a record for our race,
and is a glorious refutation of the miserable
and malicious lie that they had “forgotten
their country.”
The Cosme people, with one or two excep-
tions, would give years of their lives to be
back in Australia again. And what better
material could be found for settling the
empty North than these hardy, self-reliant
folk who have been battling with the tropical
Paraguayan wilderness for 20 years? If
Australia really wants the North populated
by men of our own race, where can she find
a more congenial or profitable task than in
repatriating and settling these people and
their families there?
. Australia may find thousands of European
immigrants and war-worn soldiers to plant in
the Territory, but she will never get any-
thing so eminently fitted for the development
of the North as these our own people, who
are being wasted on a morally and finanei-
all.v-bankrupt country like Paraguay.
And the matter is hereby earnestly com-
mended to the attention of those whom it
should concern.
BAD AUSTRALIAN.
MENDOZA, ARGENTINA.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Disunited Australia and the Pound of
Steak.
Tiie High Court has made it all clear at
last. A year or so back it was established by the
N. S. Wales wheat grab that if a State took
possession of any commodity, ownership
being thus vested in the Crown, the State
aforesaid was acting within the law when
it refused to allow any person to push its
property over the border. Now, in the
Bananaland meat case, the Court lays it
down that if the State announces by Act of
Parliament its intention not to allow a com-
modity to be transferred over the line
because the Crown will possess itself of the
goods later on if they are wanted, this also
is good law, since it fails to outrage the
Commonwealth Constitution, which declares
that trade, commerce and intercourse
between the States shall be absolutely free.
How it can be free if.six States have the
power to legislate to prevent it being free
is another matter, and seemingly is of no
consequence whatever, the legal point being,
not whether there has been interference with
ordinary intercourse, but whether the States
still have authority to put their joint and
several feet down. A majority of the Court
found: —•
The power of the Legislature of Queensland ex-
tended to making laws for the peace, order and good
government of that State in all cases whatsoever. A
law having for its object to make stock bred in
Queensland available for food for the Impel ial
Forces was a law conducive to the good government
of that State.
Also, apparently, when the said law pre-
vents Australian forces in Sydney and Mel-
bourne getting Bananaland steak until they
arrive in England, it is conducive to peace
and happiness all round. And as the inci-
dent keeps up the price of the domestic
brisket and sirloin for Sunday at Parra-
matta and Coogee, “good government’’ gets
an additional testimonial, or thistle or some-
thing. But what a farcical inversion of the
clear intention of the Constitution it all is!
As the law now stands the provision in the
Constitution protecting inter-State trade from
any barriers that might be constructed by
State Parliaments is about as dead as last
year’s mutton. All that it would be neces-
sary for Victoria to do if Peacock wanted
to prevent cauliflowers or barracouta being
dragged over the Murray would' be to pass
an Act to retain them lest Collingwood
should be invaded by Montenegro. In fact,
it seems quite possible that a single, all-
embracing measure could be framed that
would tie inter-State trade up into more
knots than if each State was running a
tariff.
W. Higgs and the Let ’er Slide Policy.
Federal Treasurer Higgs last week made
what was alleged to be “a reply” to charges
ot extravagance against the Government, in
course of which he said they had been pre-
fened by people who overlooked the increased
cost of goods and services. He went on to
remark:—■
Study of the interim financial statement of Sep-
tember 27 would show that the total expenditure in
the pre-war year 1913-14 was £25,000,000 in
round numbers. In the first year of the war it
£40,000,000, in the second year to
£70,000,000, and the estimated expenditure for the
third year was over £120,000,000. It seemed to be
forgotten that war costs money, and the longer the
war lasts the greater the yearly cost.
Brother Higgs might just as well have
declared that the day after to-morrow
will not be the night before last and
have challenged the universe to contradict
him. The charge of extravagance is neither
sustained nor disproved by flinging down a
large hunk of figures about what the war
costs. But it is given considerable force by
the knowledge common to every citizen of the
Commonwealth that—
(l) The Australian war expenditure is conducted
upon principles which would bring any commercial
undertaking to ruin.
(2) Parallel with the drain of war on the country’s
resources, the ordinary departmental expenditure of
the Commonwealth goes leaping upwards.
(3) Every department into which an independent
investigator has pushed an inquiring nose has been
pronounced to be run on wasteful, costly lines.
If lliggs is prepared to deny this, he ought
to do it. The charge of extravagance
applies not only to the Commonwealth but
to every one of the Seven Ministries infest-
ing this happy land. They are all struggling
tor pre-eminence as spenders and taxers, and
that the sum total of their operations is
shockingly dangerous is known by no man
better than by W. G. lliggs.
♦
The Chance of Low Prices and High
Wages.
A cable last week told us that Ford, advo-
cate of peace and maker of stuffed doves and
motor-cars, intends to pay his expert women
workers a minimum of £ 1 per day—the same
as the. men get. It sounds like,good wages
and might have been expected to depend on
some huge increase in the cost of motor-cars
in U.S.A. But it doesn’t. Cars of all
sorts are cheaper than ever. One can be
bought for £80; and the average price of
all U.S.A. cars is said to be only £l2O. Add
to this fact that strength and reliability
have improved with the. reduction of cost
and the increase of wages, and it is plain
that in some departments at least the people
across the Pacific have a lot to teach us.
The lesson lies in organisation under satis-
factory tariffs. Every new industry brought
into being by a tariff makes it easier to
establish another. We say lately how the
establishment of the coke-making industry
in Australia had made it possible to estab-
lish the steel industry. The steel industry
will make it possible to establish a dozen
others ; and the dozen others will make the
steel industry so much more profitable that
it will be able to pay higher wages than
are possible to-day. This is the process
that is going on in the United States, which
were. not afraid to make a start with a high
tariff. The women workers at Ford’s fac-
tories are now lifting a pound a day as the
reward of that policy. It is more than the
Australian workers could get even if they
had a wages board apiece.
Conscience and Cold Feet.
The person with “conscientious objections”
begins to loom largely in the Exemption
Courts. Usually his conscience didn’t start
putting in any serious work until about the
week before last; and when this is the case
the extent to which his feet affect his moral
outlook is difficult to determine. Still, there
ls such a thing as conscientious object.on.
and it requires sympathetic handling. It
may, no doubt, be argued that no man has
a right to a private conscience which con-
flicts with that, of the State; but this is a
dangerous doctrine,' and has caused more
trouble than most other things. To get over
the difficulty it is necessary to set aside
certain specific national work, the doing of
which by conscripted labor may enable others
with no conscientious scruples to take their
places in the fighting ranks. Such work
should not be regarded as in any way dis-
honorable ; but it should be hard enough,
distasteful enough, and (if necessary.)
dangerous enough to fairly test the good
faith of the conscientious' objector. Your
real conscientious objector is of no use as a
recruit. If true to his convictions he would
lay down his arms in face of the foe and go
to his death with a smile. Yet there is no
reason why on that account he should not
bear a special portion of the burden of the
community in return for its protection. If
this alternative were properly known and
the person called to serve his country had to
face one of two evils, the military camp
would probably miss very few recruits. But
whether that be so or not a cheap insult is
not the way to remove a serious obstacle.
Compulsory military service must be admin-
istered with discretion, and not by the crude
methods which answer well enough when
drafting ewes and wethers.
♦
Much though The Bulletin regrets that
lliggs, Gardiner and Russeix were not of
different mind about compulsory service, it
has no word of hostile criticism to offer
over their resignation from the Ministry.
No reasonably decent men could have
remained after having evidence of
Hughes’s scheme to interfere with the voting
at Saturday’s poll. That the Prime Minister
should have seen fit to heavily discount the
efforts of every speaker and writer in Aus-
tralia supporting compulsory service by
committing himself to continual contradic-
tions, evasions and wild verbal eruptions
was perhaps his affair. But that he should
have tried to associate them with a device
for fouling the ballot-box is something
which The Bulletin at any rate repudiates
any connection with or toleration of. By
their resignation and exposure of the con-
templated trickery lliggs and the others
saved the political life of Australia from an
outrage that would have made mockery of
our institutions and defiled the very altar of
liberty.
From a man who speaks with some
authority :
Far at sea I can still hear Cockatoo Dock scream-
ing for reform. This is the third transport I have
had experience of. The engineer of one of them esti-
mated that the refitting of his boat cost double
what it should have done. Apart from straightout
loafing on the job, silly sectional rows between
unions as to who should do little scraps of repair
work here and there were responsible for numerous
delays. Stories of quiet poker parties of workmen in
out-of-the-way parts of the ship are vouched for.
But it is not merely the loafer who is wasting
money. A steriliser was erected in such a position
that one of the boats could not have been launched.
A hospital was built in such a position that the
first sea shipped would hit it. This happened, and
the hospital was stove in. Not that it mattered
much, as the place had been untenable even in
moderate weather owing to constant leaks through
the roof and floor. The wireless room was in like
condition, in spite of the valuable apparatus it
contained. During wet weather the operators spent
their time plugging up leaks. This though the
safety of the ship might have depended on the wire-
less working efficiently. I could give many more
instances, including the construction of “ports” that
couldn’t be closed. This, however, should be enough
to at least suggest the disgraceful character of the
dock work which is being done under Government
employ in the port of Sydney. It is a commonplace
observation that the Government won’t interfere —
and “How can you expect ’em to?” you are asked. I
don’t know whether it’s a reasonable thing to expect
them to. But in that case, so that the responsibility
might be divided, and that the punishment for get-
ting a fair thing done should not fall on the Labor
party only, I do think it would be proper in this
crisis to have a National Government.
“Ex-Banker” : When Treasurers are east-
ing round for revenue it is opportune to call
attention to an unused fund of money which
properly belongs to the Governments, either
as trustee or as legal owner in lieu of the
original owner. There are in the hands' of
banks, public companies, liquidators,
assignees and trustee companies large and
numerous sums of money unclaimed by
their owners, which do not and never can
belong to the persons holding them. The
Statute of Limitations with its six-year
period applies to debtors, not creditors.
When, 20 years ago, I first wrote to The
Bulletin on this subject I gave an in-
stance from my own banking experience of
how easy it is for depositors’ deposits, either
fixed or on current account, to be lost by
the owner. A careless ledgerkeeper opening
a new ledger had to transfer over 500
unclaimed balances. He was a bad writer
and a worse teetotaller, and when he had
finished copying in the names of the
customers, mostly dead and all forgetful,
not even he could read them. They were
never checked or called over, and "if by-
chance “Thomas James” applied for an
old balance left by him when he went shear-
ing in Queensland 10 years previously, he
was told there was no money at his credit
and of course; Thomas having no proof, the
matter ended. The new name.in the new ledger
was Thomas Jones,” and the money
belonged to nobody henceforth. I suspect
when that bank closed its door all its
unclaimed balances were transferred to' a
suspense account and disappeared for ever.
♦
“F .N.T.” ; The other day I was in a little
township at the foot of the Dandenongs.
Much of the countryside is cut up into small
farms and orchards, and 10 or 50 children
from the neighboring blocks were outside the
little school playing games on the grass
beneath the gums. It was an attractive
picture, particularly when compared with
the dusty, dreary “recess” at the average
suburban State school. Yet most of these
children, growing up i.u apparently ideal
The Commoner.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Lords, through summers a hundred score I
have flung to the sod below
Shovel and flail for the sword and mail, the
gun or the singing bow—
How have you guerdoned, how shall you
guerdon, me who have served you so?
Long in the shade of your buttressed walls
you cherished me and mine,
A sturdy, shock-head breed, to fight and to
follow the herding swine ;
Passive in heart-deep ignorance, ankle-deep
in the mast,
We bowed at the beat of your jennet’s feet,
while you and your ladies passed,
Dragging in peace your firing logs, storing
the yellow yield,
Whose every grain we had wrung in pain
from the balk-edged Virgate field ;
And for the toil we rendered you, the fruits
we gave to your hand.
Your favor cast us the common right of the
outer meadow T -land,
The boon of shelter beneath your sword, of
your wisdom’s chance redress,
And to fight in quarrels we recked not of,
and understood the less.
Ever when lords had wounds to salve or a
petty'pride to save,
We strung the ash and we swung the axe
and pushed with the pike and glaive,
Spitted and slew, for a poke of loot and a
parcel of buttered words,
Vassals who foraged and fought in turn at
the hest of other lords;
True as a dog to lord and law, lusty and
witless we,
Who looted and laughed and loosed the
shaft in Spain or Picardy.
And some by the Maid and the blade won
through, and some by the wayside
dropped,
And others sailed for the Downs again with
the thumb of the bow-hand lopped ;
Landless men we mattocked and threshed
for the tale of our niggard pence,
All-but-dead we buried the dead in the years
of the Pestilence,
Grinned in the brank and the galling stocks*
and stank in the county jail,
Counted our measure of happiness by the
hoops on a pot of ale.
You struck our hands for a partridge-snare
and a bended bow in the brake.
Our scooped-out eyes have showed the price
we paid for a leveret’s sake.
Yet ever we groped toward the goal of our
souls’ imaginings;
Stupid and faithful we served you, lords!
God knows we have loved you, Kings!
You filohed our fallows to graze your sheep.
and clipped our common land,
And we wrote the lesson you taught in
blood, that our sons should understand.
Stubborn, seeking the meagre hope the hid-
den years might give,
V e labored and lived and throve amain, for
only the strong might live !
And when, perchance, for a grinding tax or
a stolen field in fee,
We rose and struck, you rode and slew with
your swording yeomanry,
Hunted the bitter remnant out to harbor in
ditch and hedge,
Ilested thereafter, and lifted thanks to the
God of your privilege.
Later, your mine-shafts stabbed the land, and
we followed the winding seams
In the gutted earth, while you built us
towns and slagged our running streams.
From Time’s grey dawn we have learned to
sweat that your limbs might softly lie,
For we knew the law—that the man should
serve, and the master rule thereby.
Ever and ever you rendered thanks that the
people’s hearts were true
To fight in a myriad wars for the land they
could not own—and you !
Lords, for a hundred score of years we have
fought on. sea and land
The wars of your brewing we recked not of,
nor cared to understand ;
We have counted virtue in wounds and dirt,
in death have we holden fast,
And you filled our bellies with empty praise
and a broken faith at the last.
You have lauded and armed and thrust us
forth, and you whom our bodies guard—
What have you paid of the pledge you made,
in the calm of the Afterward?
You have drilled our kind in the ordered
ways, in the fear of the traitor’s Hell,
Taught us the masterless servants’ shame
—God, but you schooled us well!
There is never a thread of the garb you
wear, nor a grain of your sorry gold.
But was won by the favor of these our hands
and our fathers’ hands of old.
We have owned the cheer of the fireless
hearth and the fungus-blotted wall,
For that which had been must always be,
and the law was over all;
You figured and posed, and vapored schemes
r for the poor man’s deep distress,
Till our pockets brimmed with your minted
words, and our souls with your promises.
Shall it count for nothing that, biding still
by your master-written creed,
We have bled for twice a thousand years,
and a thousand still may bleed?
(For this is the way of the common man,
though his sad heart dare the steel
In a wageless quarrel he never sought, he
cannot be aught but leal !)
Yet a seed may sprout where a hand has
sown, and the minds of simple men
Being turned to brooding, grow thereto, nor
lightly turn again!
We have ringed your banners and borne your
scars the blood-bought ages through";
We are sick to death of your promises—is
there nothing, lords, ye can do?
To-night, from the heart of sullied France
to the dunes and the Flemish sea, '
W e light by the law of years that were, for
the sake of the years that be.
Tie are maimed and die for freedom, lords!
Will you never make ns free?

“The Bulletin’s” Advice to Farmers: “Co-operation is the Farmers’ Salvation.”
That is why Every Farmer of Australia should place his insurances with
THE FARMERS AND SETTLERS’ CO-OP. INSURANCE CO. OF AUSTRALIA LTD.
This is what The Bulletin's “Wild Cat” Column said on October 6, 1916
“The Farmers ami Settlers’ Co-op. Insurance Co. of Australia, Ltd., was formed something
over a year’ago, with the object of getting the farmers to be their own underwriters. .. .They
have over 1000 policy-holders on the register, and so far as possible the number of shares
allotted to them is based on the amount of premium they can command AXV REPUTABLE
CONCERN WHICH GOES OUT, AS THIS CO. IS DOING, AND ATTEMPTS' TO MAKE THE
FARMER A CO-OPERATOR, DESERVES WELL OF THE COUNTRY But if a few thousand
of farmers would become interested in a fire office, and send it their insurances without canvass, on
condition that they got a refund of the profit, they would save themselves in the aggregate one-
fifth at least of what they now pay in premiums.
“As at July 31 the co. had a capital of £10,337, and there was £14,83G of this intact.
Considering that the co. has had to introduce itself, and has been trying to sell shares as well
as insurance, (his is very satisfactory. Nominally the co. shows a profit of £3075....the
results of the first year’s trading are gratifying. A dividend of 6 p.e. is to be paid: £9BO.
Shareholding policy-holders can make the expense rate (and therefore the profits) great or
small as they please.”
WHAT CO-OPERATION CAN DO FOR FARMERS.
“The record of the Canterbury Farmers’ Co.-op. Association,
way to Australian farmers. Here 7500-odd co-operating farmers
a co. which has for years been saving them 5 p.c. on the cost of
them 30 p.c. of their selling commissions, returning them 84 p.c.
Ltd., should surely point the
of Canterbury have built up
their purchased goods, saving
on their invested capital, and
studying their interests all the time. . . .It is only when all the fanners of Australia and Maorilaiul
are organised for business as are the Canterbury farmers that they can hope to wield their full
power, commercially or politically.”— (Bulletin, 26/10/’16.)
With the assistance of Australian Farmers the same magnificent results can be secured for them in their insurances by the Farmers and Settlers’
Co-op. Insurance Co. of Australia, Ltd.

surroundings, depend almost entirely on
their parents for the education which is to
keep them on the land ns producers. Since
it isn’t the business of the State to raise
young agriculturists as a by-product of its
compulsory system of primary education,
these children learn about butterflies and
whipbirds and wattleblossom in the State
curriculum, but not about potato blight and
mussel-scale and stable-ventilation. The
children at Bungledook don’t calculate in
terms of soil and crop and live-stock ; they
do the same work as the children at West
Melbourne, Victoria spends large amounts
each year on farm experiments and in
advertising its preparedness to impart the
higher agricultural education. But that’s
all entirely the business of the Agricultural
Department, with its agricultural schools,
and of the University, with its chair of agri-
culture. Both of them are dismal failures,
judging by the scarcity of graduates. A
State which had its brains fitted in the right
place would see that the best plan for edu-
cating the rural-producer *in serviceable
quantities is to drop crop-knowledge and
fertiliser-lore into the compulsorily-educated
kid. He’ll take some of it home to dad ; and
most likely he’ll use the rest later on when
he gets a block of his own.
The case as it has been set out from day to
day lately :
Allied claims that the enemy is being walloped
on the Somme.
German claims that the position thereabouts is
sreure and that the attack must fail in its objective.
Roumanians said to be holding their own. Ger-
mans assert they are advancing.
Russians fighting hard and stated to he hurrying
mere troops to Roumania.
Enemy submarines increasingly active among
British and neutral shipping; and large numbers of
new “subs” said be building.
French hit out suddenly at Verdun and wrest back
various fortified positions.
The usual conflicting yarns about the internal
condition of the Fatherland.
And apparently it will be that way when
General Rain and the Heavy Frosts arrive in
a day or two and the wearied armies settle
down to wait until the mud dries up and
they can get into their stride again. Perhaps
by that time the chaos in the vicinity of
Greece may be tidied lip ; but there is nothing
to indicate that anything more decisive will
have occurred, though, unless enough Rus-
sians leap into Bulgaria directly, the hap-
penings thereabouts may provoke the Kaiser
to give the kids another holiday. Just at
present the individual with prophetic utter-
ances about Germany being on the verge of
being wiped off the map is keeping very quiet.
That at least is something to thank the good
Lord for. It gives a chance to the man who
wants to shout into the public ear that the
way to victory is long and hard and rough,
and that there is nothing to look forward to
but many months of battle. And if something
else is looked forward to and prepared for,
the wash-up may be a less joyful business
than a lot of people were thinking 12 months
ago.
At the time of writing the trench vote and
the absentee’s scrap of paper may or may
not turn the balance in favor of a Referen-
dum “Yes.” But that is of little material
consequence. The roar of “No” has been
far too emphatic to be disregarded by the
Federal Parliament as it is now constituted.
We shall not have conscription. But our
men must have reinforcements. Our whole
job now is to get them by the only means
that offer—by a vigorous recruiting cam-
paign. And upon those who declared that
compulsion was not necessary—upon those
who affirmed that we could fully reinforce
our men without “putting the shackles of
conscription” upon the people—rests the
heavy end of the responsibility of making
that campaign a success.
Before State politicians and the press enter
upon the new recruiting campaign one thing
ought to be made quite clear to the Defence
Department and the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment. There must be no more monkey-
ing either with news about the war or
with criticism of the Defence Department;
and a definite undertaking to that effect
must be extracted from the Commonwealth
Government. In the past anything and almost
everything has been suppressed “in the in-
terests of voluntary enlistment.” There was
nothing that could not be held to be in some
remote way “prejudicial to recruiting.” Those
who had to fight the recent campaign know
the result. They know that past lying and
past. suppression of the truth were among
the worst difficulties they had to wrestle
with. And while so much was to be lost
nothing was to be gained by it; therefore in
England, after the first few weeks of the
war, there has been no censorship compar-
able with the insufferable tyranny which has
been imposed and maintained in Australia.
Before State politicians enter upon the new
campaign they should, then, at least insist
that this tyranny, which ended only with
the opening of the conscription campaign,
shall not be resumed under the old pretext
that anything and almost everything is
“prejudicial to recruiting.”

The Gonsalez singers gave two new per-
formances of exceptional merit last week.
Both in “Ernani,” spangled with Verdi's
flowers of orchestration, and in the light
music of Rossini’s “Barber of Seville” the
male chorus and the orchestra were in better
form than on any previous occasion. Pre-
sumably they have been merely rehearsing
and trying it on the Sydney dog for the
last 10 weeks. And the dog has, in moments
of agony, bitten savagely. The female chorus
is where it was—a slipshod conglomeration
which sings askew and hooks up its dresses
in the same fashion. In “Ernani” the enthu-
siasm began early—with a vociferous encore
to the opening song of the gentleman supers.
Tenor Dagradi and soprano de Revers were
more satisfactory than in many former
operas. Basso Cacialli and baritone
Scamuzzi gave, as usual, admirable perform-
ances. Scamuzzi, as Carlo V., with a flam-
ing red wig, amethyst leather boots nearly
to his waist, and brown kid gloves, carried
off the vocal honors of the evening.
“The Barber of Seville” gave Scamuzzi a
great opportunity. As the merry rascal
Figaro he was in charge of the stage most
of the evening. Miss Gonsalez, though not
at her best as Rosina, was still a charming
minx who led her jealous old guardian
Bartolo the very devil of a life. Fooling
does not fit the stately Balboni, and he
wasn’t drunk enough to suggest anything
but a ginger-beer party. Cacialli fortified
the nonsense of the evening in deep notes
like the ultimate chord the organ lost in
the long ago. Petrucci gave a three-star
performance as the ancient dodderer, Bar-
tolo. This week the Gonsalez people are
warbling good-bye to Sydney in five revivals.
The gloomy fact must be faced that to-
morrow night “Romance” flees from Sydney
Criterion —probably for ever—carrying
beauteous Madge Fabian with it. On Satur-
day evening syphilis will be the sole attrac-
tion. The Firm, after much prodding by
good citizens, will produce Brieux’s famous
“Damaged Goods” for a brief season.
“To-night’s the Night” froths and bubbles
inside Sydney Majesty’s as though it were

not the Day of Judgment outside. It makes
you either forget or remember the war,
according to y.our disposition.
If Sydney’s opinion is any criterion, then,
when Allen Doone’s body lies a-mouldering
in the grave, his role as “Happy-go-Lucky
O’Shea” will go marching on. Palace
(Sydney) is the address.
The Garden Theatre (Sydney), where the
Red Dandies bloom, got its covering umbrella
fitted just in time. As this week’s issue of
Tiie Bulletin swims to press Noah’s
ancient flood yarn begins to take on a gleam
of possibility. Manager Branscombe de-
clares that his show is watertight and lies
on ball bearings, so that, if the waters cover
the face of the earth, the theatre will float
and. ablaze with lights and resounding
with songandance, will go rolling on to
Giory. No extra charge will be made.
"The BARBER OF SEVILLE," AT
SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE.
Figaro ( Scamuzzi ) gives Bartolo (Petrucci)
a comic shave.
Some slight songandance variations at
Sydney Tivoli, where the Follies are; other-
wise a quiet day on the Castlereagh-street
front. At the week-end Vera Pearce intro-
duced a poi-poi dance scena, and Daisy and
Sydney Yates continued with an Apache
item. Somehow the self-conscious stage
Apache doesn’t seem to be so terrible in the
country that bred pushes long before the Big
Push was dreamt of. Why doesn’t some-
body invent an Australian larrikin dance
and give the Apache a rest? He needs it.
Sydney movies this week: —
Hoyt’s: Theda Baja, the vampire woman, in a
six-act Wm. Fox drama, “The Galley Slave”; and
“The Weakness of Strength,” a glimpse of the capi-
talist in the bad old days.
Lyceum: Norma Talmadge in a.clever Jekyll-Hyde
role (“The Social Secretary”) ; and other Triangle
features.
Melbourne remembers many revivals of “A
Royal Divorce,” each of them, all things
considered, weaker than the one that went
before. The original picturesque array
of Napoleonic courtiers has dwindled down
to a small and shabby gathering; the fSte in
the Garden of the Tuilleries is a diminished
festivity; the horrors of war in the incidental
tableaux are not as appalling as they were
of yore. Moreover, familiarity continues to
breed contempt for the simple fustian dia-
logue of this artlessly theatrical drama,
wherein no character save the drunken inn-
keeper conveys any sense of realism to one’s
critical faculty. The characters do not live.
The performers merely act, and mostly
succeed in doing their bit fairly well in a
mechanical manner. All of which being
duly stated, the fact remains that “A Royal
Divorce,” on the strength of its subject
matter and its audacious perversions of the
truth about Josephine, has been a sure
money-getter for exactly 19 years. Money
talks. It testifies, as a rule, to the public’s
poor intelligence. But, anyhow, it Talks.
Napoleon Knight, the great military person-
age whose methods are now as obsolete as
those of Julius C;esar, and J. B. Atholwood,
the innkeeper who was licensed to be always
drunk on (lie premises, are the two reminders
of the original cast. Time has mellowed
them in their parts. Knight is all the more
Napoleonic for being rather thicker than he
used to be, and his testimony to the wondrous
courage of the English is a more popular
histrionic effort than ever it was. Miss Jean
Robertson is a tall and elegant Josephine
with a sweet, expressive voice. She looks
too young for Nap.’s first wife, and neglects
to dress her hair in accordance with histori-
cal pictures of that giddy lady ; but she has
stage dignity for half a dozen ill-used
empresses, and promises to be a more con-
vincing actress a year or two hence. Miss
Sparks is a tall and tolerably efficient Marie
Louise. Miss Anderson, ns Stephanie, is
bright and lively without being sparkling.
For the rest of the principal speaking parts
tl#re are Herbert Leigh as an utterly nn-
courtly Talleyrand, Boyd Irwin, Sweeney,
Stuart and Lloyd in becoming uniforms, and
Emma Temple as the nurse to a conven-
tional knickered stage girlie described as
Napoleon’s baby-boy.
* * *
At Melbourne Princess’s the wearisome
Follies of Pleasure have ceased to drag an
inch of puerile jest over a yard of space, and
the house is just now wrapped in silence.
On Saturday (fourth) Allan Wilkie and co.
return with their Sliakspearian repertoire.
The season opens with “Taming of the
Shrew,” in which Miss Hunter-Watts im-
personates the chastened Pankhurst of the
period.
At Melbourne King's until Friday night
parson Pliinmer will continue to vex his con-
gregation by introducing billiard-tables,
divorced ladies and other godless things into
the mushy ’Murkan parish of Lovers’ Lane.
IMi miner, by the way, is piling on adipose
tissue, and begins to look like a reverend
Socialistic endeavorer who gets toffee for
breakfast, likewise for tea. On Saturday the
Carroll and Beaumont Smith co. comes along
with “While the Billy Boils,” and the lamp
of Australian farcical drama will be re-
lighted.
❖ * * *
“The Cinema Star” keeps on shining at
Melbourne Majesty’s, thanks to Florence
Young, Clyde Cook and Minnie Love in
particular, and a number of other considera-
tions in general. There have been no changes
in relative values since the first night, nor
is there any noticeable difference in the
plot. A lot of the entertainment has nothing
whatever to do with the plot, so a few altera-
tions in the career of Josiah Clutterbuck
would make no real difference, anyhow.

Wirths’ Circus, whereof this paper has
already remarked that it is more exciting
than usual, will stay another two weeks in
Melbourne. Next week, being the Feast of
Horse, will be full of money for the circus,
and an extra matinee may be confidently
expected.
The one thing wanting in Melbourne
Tivoli bill is a special feature. Half of it
consists of The Strollers. Now, Sydney
James, Madeline Rossiter and their accom-
plices (including the dummy) are just a
pleasing smile rather than a feature. The
first part also lacks a protruding attraction.
The clown gymnasts, the marionettes, con-
jurer Merlin and the laconic strong man and
his balancing pal are good turns; the skaters
are satisfactory; the ’cellist and the dancing
fiddler bring up the rear. Cardo and Noll
and two or three other people will return on
Saturday.
Up to time of writing the Pink Dandies,
at St. Kilda (Vic.), have had no assistance
from the weather. Given a rise in the pre-
vailing temperature the tuneful little co.
could always get a warm reception. The
last change of programme was distinctly the
best up to date.
Albert Chevalier, the notable English
comedian, is appearing in a film called “The
Bottle” at Hoyt’s Melbourne house this
week. “The Bottle,” it may be said, is a
sermon on Derrink, and Albert has to gibber
fearsomely as the Dreadful Example. Bertha
Kalich, the beautifully-coiffured Roumanian
actress, is a welcome reappearer in a five-
part Fox item entitled “Ambition.” Bertha
is a luscious bribe in a matter affecting an
official appointment, but the gent, to whom
the lady is offered declines the gift. In the
third Hoyt feature, “The Flower of No
Man’s Land,” a winsome little actress, Viola
Dana, figures as a small prairie violet that
is doomed to fade in a bad man’s keeping.
A Sioux champion of betrayed virtue plays
a big part in the film and gives a thrilling
exhibition of stealthy Injun r-revenge.
Adelaide shows are quiet. Maggie Moore,
always herself and always welcome, at the
Tivoli; a strong variety co., with the Man-
churian athletes at the top, at the Majestic;
the pleasant Dandies at Austral Gardens.-
The rest pictures: the Fox variety at the
Royal, Tom Brown and his Schooldays at
Wondergraph, views of New York at West’s.
Some day a man who might find a worse
job will go round Australia and have a look
at the kinds of Public Enterprise various poli-
ticians have been playing with these last few
years. One of the “experiments” calling for
prompt examination is the State shipbuild-
ing yard in Vic. If this proceeds at the
present gait the whole population will soon
be toiling to keep the blessed thing going.
There seems to be a violent hurry-up with
everything except the jobs on hand. A tug
ordered in December, ’l3, on the understand-
ing that it would be delivered in nine months,
was completed in two years and two month's.
A launch to have been finished in six months
was a year and six months overdue. The
Melbourne Harbor Trust ordered a suction
dredge; but as the job had not been started
nine months after the contract was let, the
Trust wearily set about getting a machine at
another address.

Nap riwing his
first missus.
“Kaniva”: I can go part of the way with
'"Fax” (B. 19/10/TG) regarding the Wil-
liamson chorus; hut I call a halt when he
says: “Australia isn’t producing the wealth
of voices that she did when Melba was a
girl.” Certainly, J.C.W. principals are not
so good; but as 90 per cent, of them are
imported, what bearing has that on Aus-
tralian voices? There are better voices in
the chorus at the present time than the last
half-dozen imported soloists iiave owned.
The G. and S. revivals of two years ago
were marked by atrocious vocalisation; it
was below the level of a sixpenny suburban
church concert. No wonder the ambitious
Australian girl, seeing no chance in alleged
comic opera, takes the first opportunity of
distinction in the seaside shows. When
Rosina Buckman appeared with the J.C.W.
management about six years back she easily
proved that no imported priraa donna of the
last 15 years was near her in talent. I
heard most of the native-born vocal products
of “Fax’s” golden age, and I don’t believe
the supply has run out or is in danger of
doing so. But not until Australia shows that
it wants its own sweet singers in preference
to the imported mediocrities will the locals
get the show that Violet Varley and the rest
of them secured.
Of course there has been a hubbub in
Adelaide over Melba’s comment on the way
the local Conservatorium has handled the
winner of the first Melba scholarship: “It
will take months to undo the results of pre-
vious training.” . Doris Leech, of whom this
is said to have been said, has risked the
consequences and declared she has had “the
very best training,” softening that, however,
with the observation that “no doubt my
voice has altered with cultivation”—this
apropos the verdict that she has been
trained as a contralto though she is natu-
rally a high soprano.
“Bob D.”: What about making the censor-
ship of plays and pictures a Federal affair?
At present it is in the hands of the different
States, and occasionally the Customs Depart-
ment butts in. This is the sort of thing
that results. J.C.W., Ltd., has received
permission to play “Damaged Goods,” but
when that piece was offered to a local film
concern for the screen 12 months ago the
Customs Department would not guarantee
its entry into the Commonwealth. The
Firm will be able to reach only a few thou-
sand Australians at most, whereas the cino.
would have preached the much-needed ser-
mon to several hundred thousand, and 12
months sooner.
Florence Rockwell, who is on her way to
Australia for J. C. Williamson, Ltd., has
been here half a dozen times already—on the
films. The six pictures in which she has
been seen have won her so much fiapperly
admiration that the Firm is dreaming of a
packed gallery every night.
Stella Cazalla, in private life Mrs. Ernest
Lashbrooke, died recently. Coming from
England she made her first visit to Maoriland
with the Wykeham-Noble company in 1!)12.
Subsequently she played in “The Blue Bird”
and “Humpty Dumpty.”
Betti Vanini, a noted Vienna opera singer
of other days, died recently in that city.
She was 102 years old or even less, and had
not appeared since the burning of the Ring
Theatre in Vienna in 1881. That tragedy,
one of the worst theatre fires in the world’s
history, in which 550 persons were killed, so
shattered Vanini's nerves that her career
was finished. The opera in progress was
Offenbach’s “Tales of Hoffmann,” and it was
not staged again for years.
John Glendinning, who came from America
with Nance O’Neil as Earl of Essex and
Ingomar 11 years ago, has just died in Eng-
land. He had an Australian connection
inasmuch as he was nephew of the late John
Thompson, for many years editor of the
Maitland Mercury. Born at Whitehaven,
Cumberland, in early life he was leading man
for Walter Bentley, F. R. Benson and the
Kendalls. He married the English actress
Jessie Milward, and was touring England
in “The Rosary,” in which he played Father
Kelly, until a few days before his death at
Cheltenham.
“Rosna” (London) : Essie Jenyns of
beloved memory is dwelling at Kingston
Hill these days and has rented a billiard-
room and garden next to her home, for the
use of Anzacs. She keeps open house for
the boys day in and day out, and pnmdes
them with games and tea and other diver-
sions.
The new South Aus. tax on amusements
came into force this week: a farthing on
threepenny tickets; halfpenny on every six-
pence of the higher-priced. Patriotic, reli-
gious and charitable affairs exempt, subject
to proper guarantees ; dog, flower and agri-
cultural shows exempt also.
English provincial music-hall managers
Avere in a fair way to make a pile of money
recently by exhibiting a sailor billed as “The
luckiest man in the world.” He was
announced as the sole survivor of the Bul-
Avark when site was bloAvn up at Sheerness;
as part of the salvage when the battleship
King Edward Avas mined; and as one of six
seamen picked up from the Invincible at
Jutland. Unfortunately chance turned dog on
him and his tour Avas interrupted by arrest
as an impostor. Even the old understanding
that there is luck in odd numbers went sour
on him when a cynical judge handed him
five years’ hard graft.
Henry Lawson, author of “While the
Billy Boils,” is quite satisfied with Ms share
of the recent short season at Sydney Royal,
and exhibits a receipted tailor’s bill for an
impressive amount to other writers avlio
have to practise war economy. The fire
under the billy Avas extinguished by the
running out of the Royal lease; but
Beaumont Smith Avill fan the ashes with his
hat in Melbourne and brew Henry another
pannikin of golden tea. (P.S. —By the way,
the clothes were for the youngsters. Henry
doesn’t trouble much about neAV clothes for
himself.)
Another old, old story gets a neAV lease
of life on the film —“Cornin’ through the
Rye,” by Helen Mathers, Avho at her best
(in the ’7o’s) had all the cloying sweetness
of Marie Corelli, together with a sense of
rollicking humor which is quite im-Corellian.
Her most famous story has been put on the
film ; and old Queen Alexandra, Avho is still
a resolute mid-Victorian, at once sent for it
and gave it the tremendous advt. of a Com-
mand performance at Marlborough House.
Wallace BrownloAV, the gallant stage-king
who used to scare little Ma Mie Rosette, is
nowadays a Avarder at beautiful Peel Island
(Brisbane), Avhither he asked to be sent.
Walter George, of Adelaide, an old stage
colleague of Brownlow’s, called on him
lately by motor-boat and found him as fit as
could be. A slave-king in voluntary exile!
Peter”: The threatened eminence of
Rosa Alba is a reminder of the late Alf
Vincent’s discernment. , Alf discovered the
soprano in Melbourne two or three years
ago, and in his quiet way proclaimed the
voice good. Moreover, he got a few disin-
terested pressmen to listen to the novice, and
soon the most guarded of them were declar-
ing that the artist had some excuse for his
enthusiasm. Yet, strangely enough, profes-
sional Melbourne critics never detected the
possibilities of Miss Alba. Musical pedan-
try is less kindly to a natural warble than
to a modest pipe finished in a music factory.
So the young artist was allowed to escape
from Melbourne without any newspaper
prophecies of future brilliant behavior.
•Tbsenshaw”: The aristocracy will not
bulk so largely in British-made plays after
the war. Pinero hardly ever wrote a piece
serious or comic, that did not contain a
lord, a duke, or at the very least a “right
honorable.” Henry Arthur Jones, who
would sooner die than be out of the fashion,
crowded his comedies with peers and sassiety
people and bishops’ aprons. R. C. Carton,
Sutro, Maugham, Barrie, Vachell—all sought
inspiration in the atmosphere of the “best
people.” The lives of commoners, full though
they be of the stuff of drama, were seldom
exploited. Not the gallery but the half-
guinea stall was played to. But —this war
again ! Two plays are to be seen in London
at the present time, both simple chronicles
of middle-class Lancashire families. One is
“Hobson’s Choice,” the other “The Rotters.”
Neither is by a fashionable author, yet they
are the successes of the season.
“C. Ockney”: General Smith-Dorrien has
an idea that the theatres might really help,
too, and not merely pretend to help by put-
ting- up a fat girl in a few clothes to sing
softgs composed of jingo mush. So he has
addressed a timely letter to certain theatri-
cal managers begging them to raise the tone
of their performances. Says this old hard
case: “I am convinced that our soldiers and
sailors would be the first to admit that, if
they were given the choice, they would pre-
fer performances which, while cheerful and
inspiriting, appealed to the best side of their
patriotic natures, and not exhibitions of
scantily-dressed girls and songs of doubtful
character.” Of course the trade journals
mostly regret that the General was not more
‘ specific,” and the spotless London mana-
gers, especially those staging revues, are
asking one another, “Does he mean you :”
“J.F.H.”: Our latest Referee publishes a
letter from Sydney written by Cecil Brooking
of the “Peg o’ My Heart” Co. He proclaims
its 100th performance in Sydney on July .10,
and adds: “This is a record run for Aus-
tralasia.” I don’t believe it. Asked to name
the Australian longest-distance performer, I
would, on the spur of the moment, reply
“Struck. Oil.” But whether the official
statistician on the spot would confirm that
guess is another matter.
There is always something to be thankful
for. Even if Australia will not fight it out,
the inflexible resolution to talk the German
to death remains unimpaired.
“Adelaide”: No use kicking, I suppose ;
but can anyone tell me why, living in South
Aus., and drawing a trifling dividend from
a Westralian mine, I should have to pay
five shillings in the pound English income
tax on it? Presumably the Great Boulder
head office is in London. Then why is it
there? Money earned and paid and spent
in Australia ought tq pay no English tax,
and it is up to somebody to find a way of
avoiding it.
Conscription has some unsuspected virtues.
For instance, one or two of the Melbourne
banks applied for the wholesale exemption
of young clerks who were alleged to be “in-
dispensable.” “Ha,” said Dwyer, P.M., pre-
siding at the Exemption Tribunal. “Let’s
see what wages you’re paying these indis-
pensable young men.” They told him, with
a cloud of explauations. “Needn’t go any
further,” said Dwyer in effect. “You’re fair
men, I’ll presume; and I’ll judge of the
indispensableness of these officers of yours
by the salaries you’re paying them—mostly
about the same as an unskilled laborer’s.”
The Naval Dockyards in Sydney want
apprentices. There is to be a preliminary
examination, applications for which close on
November 4.
“The ranks of the anti-conscriptionists
are full of red-raggers, white-flaggers
and sand-baggers.”— Attorney-General Jim
Vaughan, after haring eggs thrown at him
in Adelaide.
It looks as though Victoria will struggle
along presently without a statistician. Pub-
lic attention is being violently drawn to the
foolishness of keeping a State tallying staff
to do nothing that doesn’t come within the
sphere of Commonwealth Statist Knibbs.
The office has lost its original excuse for
existence, and its officers might be employed
in teaching the clerks of other departments
how to put in their time.
Herbert Hughes, buried last week at Glad-
stone (S.A.), where he had lived, was the
eldest son of another of the same name who
left a lot of sons prominent as squatters.
This one stuck to the old Booyoolie run in
S.A., and the brothers are scattered about the
Darling and in Queensland. Herbert White
Hughes was known to the public chiefly for
his immensely massive build, and to his inti-
mates for his unsuspected knowledge of art.
He had been on the land ever since he left
Oxford. Losing first his wife, and then his
only son (by an accident at school), he lived
more quietly than ever till the end came at
61.
Once more the conscientious objector—a
Sydney exhibit this time: —
He was a strict vegetarian. He did not believe in
taking any man’s life, and he objected to the killing
of harmless animals.
Quite right. But there are always the
onions to peel and the washing-up to do and
the latrines to look after. A country which
wants cooks and scavengers and then turns
away somebody simply because he isn’t a
butcher, is only half-organised.
“Catkin” from the Mud: —
Here's another one for whoever is collecting war
yarns. We were in the middle of the biggest rough-
up we’ve had, and the numerous Headquarters Staffs
were working at highest pressure. The Adjutant of the
—th Brigade, which was in the thickest part of it,
was up to his ears in papers. Suddenly a motorist
tore up at full speed, dropped his machine on the
road, bolted into the office and threw down an
urgent message on the table. “Adjy” dropped his
other papers and ripped open the envelope. The
urgent message read: “Please note that the —nd
Battalion sent in an incorrect form 213. One mule
is not accounted for.”
And here’s one more. Just up the road is a “dud”
shell—in other words, a shell that didn’t explode.
Such spots are marked with a notice “Blind
Shells.” A cheerful assassin has nailed a bully-
beef tin with a slit in the top on the board, and
added “Please assist.”
“0.A.5.”: War grim? Not when such
joyous items as this are part of it. It came
in reply to our C.O.’s request to the
A.D.M.S. for an increase in our daily
“manger” (French for grub) :—•
The Field Service ration is built upon a liberal
scale, and provides a large margin to replace the
wear and tear of men employed under the trying
circumstances of war conditions.
The high proportion of protein in the dietary
enables the ration to meet the needs of tissue repair,
and in the present place of warfare the men should
have no difficulty in supplementing their rations
locally should they require to do so.
I would suggest the officer commanding taking
steps to weigh the men weekly (without clothes)
and furnishing a report at the end of the month.
Would you believe it, not one of us had
thought of bringing a set of scales or even
a weighbridge? Kindly forward one so that
we can ascertain if we really are hungry.
A send-off to one we can’t afford to lose: —
An acetylene-gas explosion on Sunday at Litligow
robbed Australia of one of its brightest young men,
Guildford Hoskins, eldest son of Charles, the plucky
and persistent ironmaster of Lithgow. Those who
knew something of the running of the Lithgow
works realise that “Gill” had got past the stage of
being the son of his father, and promised to be of
incalculable benefit to Australia in its struggle for
industrial life. The industrial birth of Australia
really occurred when Charles Hoskins and his three
sons took hold of Sandford’s works. Then began a
technical struggle which slowly and surely is earning
for the Charles Hoskins family the admiration of
every patriot who knows what is happening. The
task has been herculean, but bit by bit the old
scrap heap has been transformed into a systematised
plant, and before Australia had realised what some
of her sons were doing the Hoskinses were turning
out steel rails. To those who knew, the most
picturesque sight at the much-advertised opening of
the B.H.P. Co. Steel Works, at Newcastle, was
Charles Hoskins and Ids late son gazing down upon
that well-fed assemblage while it was being told
what a fine thing the B.H.P. had done in starting
the industry of making our own rails. Possibly the
Hoskinses went back from that gathering «nd asked
their statistician what their total outpui of rails
had been to that date; but if they did they never
mentioned it. The Hoskinses are not talkers, and at
this stage in our history, when the chief output of
the country appears to be sloppy rhetoric, a high-
minded doer like Guildford Hoskins can ill be spared.
THUMBNAIL SKETCHES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Blue skies, ablaze with joy, that gleam and sing;
Glad winds with saltish bite a little gritty ;
Brave ardors free that love and have their fling;
Fair hope that glamor sheds on everything;
Hot youth, exuberant, hand in hand with pity ;
Strong faith that sucks the honey from death’s sting—
And this is Sydney city.
A something strangely bilious in the air
That grips the host of houses grey and brown;
A sort of smartness peeping from its lair,
A haunting laughter shrill that mocks despair ;
Columbine weeping on the knees of Clown,
While Pantaloon bids all the loves beware —
And this is Melbourne town.
A golden" heat that stings in all one’s bones
And grills one’s skin till it were fit to eat
By some strayed eager cannibal named Jones ;
A heat that screams and has no undertones;
And then a blaze of color, and a sheet
Or" incandescent sunbeams hard as stones—
And this is Brisbane street.
An air of velvet, slothful and demure,
That like a blanket lies upon the staid
Still swelter of the streets ; white sunlight pure
That beats upon the brain; depth of black shade
That dreams of purple; buzz of sober trade,
Mid conscientious scruples grown mature
And quite incurable; fair dreams that fade;
Morality the popular manure—
And this is Adelaide.
A brazen blinking river strangely flat;
A roystering town too broad about the girth;
Fierce thirsts, long begrs, a shilling .in the hat;
A howling bard who terrifies the cat ;
Ten pious Christian souls who salt the earth
And prate of Hell, and persons doomed to that—
And this is Perth.

THE NEW HOMAGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A popular Buda-Pesth actress, Hansi Niese, in
acknowledging' applause after a performance at a
Vienna theatre one night last week, expressed a pre-
ference for provisions rather than bouquets as tri-
butes from the audience. Her wish is being regarded,
as since her announcement she has been nightly
presented with flour, rice and eggs.— Cable.
“Once,” said the mime, “if on the stage
You’d thrown a cabbage green,
Or eggs, 1 would have cried with rage,
As at an insult keen ;
But artists proud, when feeling hollow,
Will gladly such an insult swallow.
“So, if you’d do me homage, friends,
Then bring to me, I beg,
Not roses red, but food. Who sends
Some frankfurts or a leg
Of lamb respects my inclination,
And fills me thus—with admiration!”
VICTORIA.

SOCIETY
“A.G.” introduces his pal '“Bluey,” a
Gallipoli identity, now of Flanders: —-
lie hopped, skipped and leaped into our shell-
hole while Fritz strafed us with good Broken Hill
lead.
“Strike me pink!” says Bluey. “Me luck’s stiff,
Here was me coming out of me dugout when Ted
Dougan pushes past me, then drops. ‘Bluey,’ he
chortles, ‘l’ve got a wound, and I’m going ter
Blighty.’ If the cow hadn’t duckshoved me I would
have had a trip to Blighty meself.”
Last time Bluey went to Blighty he did not alto-
gether approve of the rules and regulations in the
convalescent camp. It was the parade after pay-day,
and we did a light march to a handy villlage, where
the mob had a quencher. Bluey had a few extra
and then disappeared. We nearly spring-cleaned the
village looking for him, and were just giving him up
JUDGED BY LOOKS.
SHE: “Does he sell many pictures?"
HE: “Oh, he says he only paints for Iris own
amusement.”
SHE: “ Indeed! Tie must paint badly.”
when the oldest inhabitant suggested looking round
the churchyard. Sure enough Bluey was there, beer-
fully reposing in the shade beneath an old time-pay-
ment tombstone. As a punishment he was put on
guard that night on No. 3 post. “Visiting rounds”
came and asked the usual questions ; also, what would
Bluey do in the event of Zeppelins coming along?
Bluey hiccuped twice, then announced that he would
“ ’and ’em over to the Quartermaster.” No. 3
post was suddenly relieved.
Bluey looked like getting a stripe after the Push
until this morning, when he was up before the O.C.
charged with looting a duck. The indictment was
read. What did he have to sav on the matter ?
“It was this way, sir,” says Bluey. “I sees a
duck, and asks her to quack for Australia. She
wouldn’t quack, so I took her prisoner.” “Case dis-
'missed,” says the O.C. “About turn, quick march.”
Bluey did a lively double.
“Billjim’s Brother”: There are tricks in
every trade. When an unsophisticated re-
cruity was put on sentry duty at our camp,
and conscientiously stuffed the guardroom
with every man who arrived after the
correct hour, he found that he was rapidly
getting unpopular. It was then that aii ex-
perienced non-com. tipped him the wink. “If
they’re sober,” he said, “there’s no sense in
putting ’em in the guardroom. It only fills
if up and gives trouble. Take ’em round
behind the guardroom, and see if they have
any fish an’ chips on ’em. They nearly
always have, and then you can punish ’em
yourself.” There’s no end of “Manuals for
Soldiers,” but never a one that tells ’em
half the things that every gnarled old ser-
geant-major knows.
* * * *
“Kuscobin”: However our cannibal bro-
ther’s soul may be progressing under the
philanthropic coaching of the London Mis-
sionary Society, his body could apparently
do with a little extra attention. The Rev.
Obeda, of Vaipae, Cook Islands, died there
the other day, aged 95, and the report of his
death states: “Maggots were actually
crawling over his body before death, and
there was no one to nurse him.” Obeda
was a retired native pastor, and had spent
the best part of his life at the job in Samoa
and other islands of the Western Pacific.
Yet, when the Resident Agent approached
the representatives of the L.M.S. for an
allowance for the destitute Obeda, he was
told that the Society had no fund for the
pensioning of native pastors. The old man’s
end, coupled with this disclaimer of any
responsibility with regard to worn-out
native helpers, is grima facie such an abom-
inable scandal that the L.M.S. must make
its defence. Silence on the subject will
brand it as a body far too dangerous to- the
white man’s prestige to be permitted in our
islands.
“Aneb” : Is the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals still dead? And do
the police continue to go about with one eye
shut? Attend any sale of stock in a dairy-
ing centre, and you'll see newly-born calves
under various forms of torture to keep them
from following Nature’s great call—jam-tins,
with serrated edges, tied over nose and
mouth; liay-band tied tightly round nose;
filthy old socks drawn over mouth and nos-
trils ; and, lately, fine galvanised tying wire
is becoming the fashion. Cows with abnor-
mally distended udders, milk oozing out of
bursting teats in constant drip, or, when
moved, in a stream, low in pain. Experi-
ence tells me that those calves haven’t been
fed, or those cows eased, for at least 24
hours. Even if cow is the curse of Aus-
tralia. in the name of our common human-
ity, don’t let us treat her with Hunuish
brutality.
“Try Fluke”: Following the example of
the Ngati-Tuwharetoa tribe, of the Taupo
Country, who gave the M.L. Government
25,000 acres of the Owlmoko block free of
all conditions for soldiers of the native race,
the Taihape section of the tribes interested
in the block is considering what it can do in
the same way. There was an Oriental
touch of courtly self-depreciation in the
Taupo people’s description of the present as
“our insignificant gift.” On the East Coast
of the North Island 2000 acres have been
given for the soldiers; the land has been
stocked with sheep, and a returned soldier
has been put in charge, to carry on until the
boys come home. . Meanwhile sundry pale-
face owners and syndicates are offering
backblocks areas to the State at full market
rates.
“The Old Soldier”: I’ve been in a few
scraps when we were short-handed, and I
wish some of our no-compulsion angels had
been handy. They’d have been cured of their
freak. Before Sebastopol, in the winter of
1854-5, the French kept their conscript army
up to 70,000 men, but England’s voluntary
service lot was at one time holding the same
length of trenches with only 12,000 fighters
fit for duty. They held it, but was it right
to put such a strain on the gallant few?
Then, in the Indian. Mutiny two years later.
20,000 British soldiers were face to face
with 200,000 native troops, as well armed,
disciplined and trained as themselves. Again
the weak force pulled through, but if any-
body thinks that that sort of thing is a fair
go I’m sorry for him. His grandmother
must have lived in a ‘tree.
Plain lack of imagination makes seeming
cowards of a lot of men. The Victorian who
told an exemption court that he would
merely “call for help” if a man tried to
ravish his mother probably libelled himself
cruelly. The most likely explanation is
that it simply isn’t in him to visualise a
domestic or national horror; therefore, when
presented with the theoretical case, he makes
himself look contemptible, whereas faced
with the actual circumstances he would no
doubt behave as creditably as the average
decent man.
WHO GOT THE DAMAGES?
LAWYER (handing cheque for £10 to workman who has been awarded £30 compensation):
“Well, what are you, looking like that for? Aren't you satisfied?"
WORKMAN (gloomily): “I was just a-wonderin' who it was fell off that scaffoldin’ —
you or me."
From a Bulletin Billjim in Egypt:—
J»
The Light Horse, after some strenuous arguments
with Abdul, are waiting for that misguided heathen
to come again. At first the son of the Prophet didn’t
realise that he wasn’t up against Yeomanry ; when he
did he suddenly recalled an urgent appointment else-
where. I heard a German n.c.o. —one of six who
had served machine-guns magnificently on August 5
until the Turks had all scooted —ask our fellows if
they were English. Quite a pleasant expression flitted
over the Huns’ faces when they found they had not
surrendered to Englishmen. 1 saw these same Ger-
mans turn their machine-guns on surrendering Tftrks
three times on August 5. In conversation subse-
quently the Teutons said that the rapid movements
of the Light Horse took them by surprise and gave
them no chance to get their guns back. These Ger-
mans with the Turks are picked men, many of them
having won the Iron Cross in Europe.
HADN’T COME HER WAY.
HE: “Of course we'll keep our engagement
dark for the present."
SHE: “Yes. But where's the present?"
Exit finally the home in which Adam
Lindsay Gordon lived at Glenelg (S.A.),
while better known as steeplechase-rider and
eccentric M.L.A. than as poet. It was a
cottage in a large garden. The former dis-
appeared years ago, and five new houses
have now finally disguised the identity of
the place. So no more is likely to be heard
of the occasional suggestion—never really
actively entertained —to “preserve” it.
The Law may be an ass, but it knows how
to pursue its oats. A while back William
Howell, herdsman of Shepparton (Vic.)
Common, proceeded against Roger Bullen,
and succeeded in having him fined £5 55.,
with £5 7s. 6d. costs. Bullen appealed and
the Supreme Court decided that the little
men were wrong, remitted the fine and
ordered Howell to pay all the costs, some
£26. Commonsense would seem to demand
that the magistrates who made the bloomer,
or the “Crown” which appointed them,
should pay the costs thereof; but the Law
doesn’t view matters from that standpoint.
Howell, either because of financial strin-
gency—few herdsmen are millionaires —or
because he thought his employers, the
owners of the public common, should part up,
omitted to pay the £26; so Bullen, through
his lawyer, asked Justice Hood to issue an
order for the attachment of the person of
Howell. His Honor hesitated a while, re-
marking that Howell “had not committed
any wrong nor been guilty of any crime, yet
it was asked that he be sent to gaol. Still
he would -not depart from established prac-
tice,” and ordered William to be “attached”
as asked. If Howell is well advised he will
pay the cash in the time specified, because
this is obviously a serious matter. He
might owe his butcher £26 for meat which he
himself had actually consumed, or even £260,
and there would be no thought of sending
him to gaol. But Costs is an obstreperous
beast, with tremendous force behind it. and
summary ways of getting what it considers
its due ; and even a Judge who sees the in-
justice and unfairness of its methods isn’t
game to defy it.
■* * * *
Who says the Hun hasn’t got a sense of
humor? Luderitzbucht, the town the Ger-
mans of South-West Africa retreated from
across 600 miles of sand and forest, had a
population of 3000, and 400 of them were
Flossies. When the British were at hand
the Germans abandoned these women, after
telling them horrible lies about what would
happen to them when the place was taken.
Subsequently a Hun aviator flew across the
captured town and released a makeshift
bomb consisting of a 4.7 shell and a small
parachute to keep it right end up. When
the 8000 troops in camp saw the parachute
inflate and steady the falling shell, a great
howl of joy went up. The parachute con-
sisted of a pair of something looted from a
lady’s wardrobe, and the blue ribbons with
which they were threaded fluttered coquet-
tishly in the breeze. As it happened, .the shell
didn’t explode, and some representatives of
the Witwatersrand Rifles won the race to
the spot and secured the dainty trifle for
the regiment’s messroom.

Blow warm, blow warm on me!
A little crescent cloud is curled
Above a dimpled sea.
A little mouth is lightly laid
Against my mouth to kiss —•
The Brown Girl, laughing unafraid,
Is queen of hours like this.
Spring with a rout of urchins ran
Past aged Winter hoar —
I saw a chill wind lig-htly fan
Her tattered pinafore.
But Summer is a woman grown
For red-haired suns to woo ;
Her days and nights have madly known
All tunes the piper blew.
Oh, piper of the hidden ways,
Blow warm, blow warm on me!
The rose lights haunt the happy days,
The hushed, sweet nights are free.
The Brown Girl lays a dimpled cheek
Against my ruffled hair,
And wise, brave joys play hide-and-seek
With truth and cash and prayer !

HOW TO GET THICK, GLOSSY HAIR.
No matter how careful you may be of
your hair —how often or how faithfully you
may shampoo or brush it—the hair cannot
attain the thick glossy brilliance nature
intended for all men, women and children
so long as the dandruff germ is sapping the
strength and vitality of the hair roots. Fre-
quent brushing of the hair and a shampoo
once every two or three weeks are both
valuable aids to gaining hair beauty, but
they cannot destroy the dandruff germ. Prac-
tically the only way to destroy this germ
is to rub into the scalp twice a day a mix-
ture prepared by mixing 3oz. Bay Rum with
7} -dram Menthol Crystals and loz. Lavona
de Composee. As this preparation not only
destroys the dandruff germ, but is also a
truly marvellous hair grower, it should be
applied only where hair is desired. Any
chemist can prepare the above formula, or
you can procure the ingredients and mix
them at home; but you must use it regu-
larly, and be sure to brush your hair fre-
quently and give it an occasional shampoo.
Avoid the frequent use of hot curling-tongs,
as they tend to make the hair dull and life-
less. — Advt.

“F.A.Q.”: I can’t understand this Conser-
vative objection to the collection of soldiers’
fingerprints. It isn’t only a criminal’s test.
Some Yankee banks require thumbprint as
well as signature on large cheques ; and in
India fingerprints are used by the civil ser-
vice examining boards. When Uncle Wood-
row’s navy enlists crews, the prints are
taken, not merely to catch deserters, but to
prevent undesirables enlisting or re-enlisting.
Two Anzaes may gaily swap identification
discs, but they can’t swap thumb signatures.
Ilair and eyes may change color, features
alter; but from childhood until death, a fid
after death, the thumb-stamp is unalterable
except by a surgeon.

“Copy Boy”: October 25 was the tercen-
tenary of the discovery—or re discovery,
perhaps of the west coast of Australia by
I)irk Ilartog. The Dutch mariner was on
his way to Batavia, and, having run further
east than he should have done, spotted a
strange coastline on the horizon and
promptly marked it on his chart, naming it
Eendracht’s Land, after his own ship. Later.
Dutch navigators ran against other parts of
our coastline and presented them with
Dutch names—Landt van Pieter Nu’yts, de
Wit’s Landt and Edel’s Landt—and the first
name used to embrace the whole was New
Holland. Ten years earlier than Dirk
Hartog’s discovery, in 1606, a Dutch yacht
had poked round the Gulf of Carpentaria,
and the little bit of this continent that came
into view was set down on the maps of the
period as part of the Indies.
LOW GUT.
SHE: “Do you like the woman in the Hue
dress?”
HE: "I like the woman out of it.”
It W£ts true enough, as he told the Exemp-
tion Court magistrate, that he had been in
the firing-line for 18 months, but it didn't
take long to find out that during that time
he had been driving for a wood and coal
merchant.
“Rag”: A tip for Billjim. Although
natives of the South Sea Islands are continu-
ally exposed to bad weather, rheumatism
rarely attacks them. European medical men
have the backing of Brown Brother when
they say that cocoanut-oil well rubbed in
does the trick. What about the girls of the
Pacific starting a cocoanut-oil fund for the
boys at war?
“S.T.S.”: They certainly said “Do the
thing well,” and then sat back and
waited for the bill, a century ago. A new
volume of historical records digs up the
detailed account for
the funeral of Gover-
nor Collins, in memory
of whom St. David’s
Church was after-
wards built at Hobart
Town in 1810. The main
items of to-day, for
horse-hire, are absent;
the expense was nearly
all for clothes. It
started with 107 yards
of black cloth, just oil
£2OO. Then everybody
in sight had to be sup-
plied with “waistcoat
front,” hat, stockings,
gloves, “E u rope
shoes,” and handker-
chiefs. The marines’
wives and female ser-
vants, 15 in all, got
black gowns, petti-
coats, stockings, shoes,
bonnets and two hand-
kerchiefs apiece, the
infant community hav-
ing to find about £l3O
for this feminine out-
fit. Buttons alone were
an extra worth £lO
16s. Other items were
“two gallons of the
best vinegar,” £2 Ss.;
“trimmings for four
pairs of pantaloons
for the'sergeants,” and
a pound of pins at
30s. The whole bill
was £507 .Bs.- 3t£-; and
the Colonial Office in London (which
evidently had its eyes open) required
an affidavit with it that “the articles
therein specified were actually deliv-
ered, and that the same had been
charged at the regular selling prices.”
“Inver G.” : A few comparisons between
Maoriland and Australian soldiers in camp
at Sydney. The
former, light horse-
men, agree that Bill-
jim has a better
clothes ration. The
strangers all wear
puttees; leggings are
not issued to them.
Naturally the put-
tee goes to shreds
when Working with
horses, but, unless at
their own expense,
there is no renewal
for six months. The
M.L. overcoats are
not as good as the
Australian mak e.
They are excellent
as to quality, but are
so absorbent that in
wet weather they
weigh aboiffi 501 b.

the O.C. of this crowd is Hine, and

“Ilassan”: Nine years ago I left Sydney
tor my own good. Three months ago I
returned, for Sydney’s good. In the in-
terim, I am shocked to observe, Sydney has
become _an American city. Half of its
population talks through its nose, and the
other half through its neck. It is infested
with American pictures, American soft-
drinks and American pugilists and vaude-
ville performers. Once upon a time it was
Australian, but now it is surely qualified to
vote in the Presidential elections. It is all
strange and painful to me. I do not like
Americans. I hate their Notes and the way
they cut the hair on their necks. Some of
my friends have taken advantage of my
absence to go for short trips to America.
Now they talk about “cutting no ice,” and
stunts, and say ‘Sure!” at least once in
every sentence. Ohidley may or may not be
mad, but at least he isn’t American and I
love him for it. The Americans are the
prime vulgarians of the earth, as anybody
who has heard their music and read their
newspapers must recognise. Why should
Sydney want to imitate them when it could

imitate the Turks or the Zulus I can’t
imagine. Sydney’s harbor is all right, but
even _it has been Americanised by electric
sky-signs. I will defer becoming naturalised
until I see how deeply the American blight
has bitten.
“F.C.”: Among other achievements the
war has stressed the need for equality of
sacrifice in peace times, as well as when the
call is for men and money. To-day we are
putting the sons of all Australian parents
into camp to help defend their country, but
we exempt the only sons. Now, what Aus-
tralia wants is large families of sons and
daughters too; but unless she encourages
them in a practical manner she is likely to
get more only sons and daughters than is
at all good for her. One way to discourage
these often pampered individuals or rather
to encourage the parents with the quiverful,
would be by an adjustment of the income
tax so that the father of three children should
pay considerably less than the father of one,
while the parents of six or more jewels
should be exempt from the tax altogether.
The father of many, whether they be boys
or girls, is not only more patriotic than the
progenitor of one, but he unavoidably pays a
much larger sum to the State in' indirect
taxation. It isn't the only son’s fault that
he is one, but it is very often the result of
design on his parents’ part, and it would do
these latter good to be touched up a bit.
Ihe parent of the only son receives a lot
more consideration than he deserves.
“0.K.” remembers a hanging :
Marshall Lyle’s long talk (B. 28/9/’l6) about the
late Albert Deeming and the suppression by the
police of certain evidence of the man’s mental in-
firmity set me thinking of the days when 1 heard
him sentenced to death and subsequently saw him
hanged and hanging. Friend Lyle states that the
evidence which might have saved Deeming from the
gallows was supplied in “cables from the lunatic
asylum he had escaped from seven years before, the
reports of his treatment as a child at a home for
mentally-afflicted children, and numerous police
reports confirming his previous insanity.’’ But would
this evidence have saved Deeming? Nobody sup-
posed that the flash, boastful bounder who had
developed a mania for wife murder, and had also
murdered his children in England, could have been
sane all the time. And nobody who saw him done
to death in Melbourne Gaol seemed to think that
the question as to the exact measure of his mental
infirmity mattered twopence. We all thought that
thing to do with Deeming was to put him
out of the world, and we all felt that the last sen-
tence of the law is a humiliating business for every-
body present except the man who dies. lie is the
helpless sufferer for his offence against society-an
offence for which he is np more responsible, maybe
tine'ss a ” Chlld responsible fol ' its instinctive “naugh-
After the execution I was “privileged” to stay
awhile in the gaol and hear some facts concerning
the deceased. I was present when the late Dr Pat
Maloney called attention to the different markings
on the two sides of the corpse’s countenance, sug-
gesting that Deeming was mild and harmless on one
side and wicked as a monkey on the other. The
man had told the . doctor, it appeared, that when he
felt impelled to murder his wife he had the strength
ot a lion, and that when his fit of ferocity was
f Z u° Wn heSk]e her boll - v on their bed and
slept for .0 hours. No doubt he was an epileptic
and it mist be admitted that “justice to epileptics,”
as European scientists view it, was not granted to
lam. But would the Law have behaved justly to
the warders in sentencing this cunning and occasion-
y murdeious animal to imprisonment for life or
would it have been fair to womankind to let him
work out his release some 20 years later?
This present war-time seems quite the wrong time
for attaching any value to the lives of men who are
murderous lunatics occasionally. A bishoD h*i«
stated that “the duty of civilisation is to kill Ger
iTw'al ,r ,er ! I W T t 0 See him banged I thought
it was the duty of civilisation to kill Deem in-
which belief has held good for more than 20 yeare!
Justice to murderous epilectics”! Why, the con-
spiracy to prevent. Deeining’s life being spared was
lea ly a conspiracy to avert a miscarriage of justice.
iiot : Well, it was “Yes-No” from me,
anyhow. Being married and anxious to
escape 41.:> creditors, Hughes’s announcement
that all men able to serve would be wanted
sounded to me like news of a win in Tatt.’s.
l gave three cheers to go on with when some-
one said that married men would be called
up by Christmas. But when Hughes
announced that married men would not be
wanted, the noise of the landlord’s boots on
the verandah sounded like the collapse of a
castle in Spain. Still, I was buoyed up with
hope by the subsequent proclamation that
married men would be urgently required if
the supply of single men failed —buoyed up. 1
say, exalted and sustained, until the further
declaration by Hughes that he would only
conscript me if the Federal Parliament gave
him authority and the Germans slew more
men during the winter than he expected.
This left me filled with apprehension of hav-
ing to undergo another winter campaign
against the grocer, and made me darkly sus-
pect someone in authority of talking bam-
boozle. So, pursued by id tailors and the
hire-furniture fiend, I rushed forth and did it
both ways for luck—“ Yes-in o.” If conscrip-
tion fails me in this hour of crisis over the
gas bill, I will have to fall back on volun-
tary effort.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
'Jliin mists—those grey rememberings of night—
Crept from the burnished brow of golden dawn,
And from the harbor came a quivering call.
The fairy music of an unseen band
Broke through the wall of dreams, and people turned
And wondered, and the light
Peered, glimmering, round the blinds, and sleepy
eyes
Opened and closed again, and to the Heads
And to the strange blue mystery beyond
Troopship A4O took the dancing tides.
And “So-long, Letty!” played the merry band,
\\ hile the young voices caught up the refrain,
And khaki figures lined the crowded decks,
And waving women on the long brown quays
Stood stiff, as though saluting, keeping back
Their tears, and in the gardens of North Shore
Red roofs gleamed wetly, and the purple hills
And little bays of tender lavenders
Sent back the joyous echoes of the song.
I woke. I slept again. I did not know
That you were on ftiat boat that took the tide.

Good-night, my own, I’m thinking of you yet—
That was my day of days. I can’t forget

Ah, how we wandered simply hand in hand,
As Eve and Adam might have, through the land
Fragrant with bloom, a-swoon with heavenly bliss —
Something of that we tasted in our kiss.”

Now that it’s all over, we might as well
hiive a handy work of reference so that we
may know who our friends are. Perhaps
Fred Johns will compile the “800-lioos’ Who
in Australia”?
Dead in his prime, Jim McCrorey, ex-
trucker, navvy, miner and company-promoter,
blessed with a grand frame and as lithe as
a panther, he fought 'for the pure love of
nght through every railway camp in the
States.. Then he took to alluvial work, and
soon picked up the fact that early news and
a quick turn in the market meant pocketing
more profits in a day than you could get by
shoving a rake of trucks for a year. So
ivicCrorey punched his way into the Mel-
bourne market and thence into the Board-
room. Here his Irish wit and nimble brain
Sot him into the front rank. There wasn’t a
Y ictorian alluvial mine he didn’t have a go
at, but the Maryborough claims attracted
him most —Main Leads, Main Leads North.
Duke Extended, Chalks No. 3, and lastly his
big float, Duke and Main Leads Extended.
On the Cathcart boom he floated Cathcart
Central, and scored his biggest win. Langi
South may be another trump card, but the
Grim Reaper got in with a better hand.
Norfolk Island is a little object-lesson in
economy waiting on the blue Pacific shelf
until a sobered Australia has time to con-
sider it. Administrator M. V. Murphy hails
from Sydney; and he runs the
speck so well that the cable which
leans on it for a rest never mur-
murs a complaint. Perhaps it’s an
advantage to be a surveyor—you
know just where to draw the line.
A genial, appi'oachable Australian,
Murphy has a hatred of “side” and
silk hats. Apropos, a whaleboat of
reverent belltoppers went out one
stormy day to a visiting cruiser to
pay a courtesy call on a Governor,
and found his Ex. waiting to re-
ceive in sensible tweeds. Murphy
was the only one of the boatload
similarly dressed. He had tipped
that there would be no cocked hat that day
and had taken the risk like a good sport.
t Retired from the N. S. Wales District
Court Bench, Charles Murray, Judge, at the
age of 74. He had been handing out law
for 3S years, and did it with microscopic
attention to detail. “You say you had thrup-
pence,” said Murray once to a witness.
“Yes.” “Well, was it in one coin or three
separate coppers?” And it didn’t matter id.
one way or the other. But he was very
sound in his law, and to the frowsy, badly-
environed prisoner in the dock usually merci-
ful. As a youngster Murray did brilliant
things at Sydney University. He was there
a contemporary of Sam Griffith’s, and with
him was bracketed for a medal after doing
Aveird things with elliptical triangles and
quadrilateral equations. When he started
in pursuit of Costs on circuit he developed
a passion for walking and generally arrived
at the next place well ahead of the other
Gent, who waited for the coach. On those
occasions the early bird captured the brief,
and the other bird felt very much annoyed.
After getting on the Bench he contracted a
dislike to the court orderly administering
the oath in the raucous tones of a wil’-rabbi’
specialist, and insisted upon doing the swear-
ing himself with great decorum. He is very
likeable, and equally thin, and addicted to
colds under the wig.
Docker—of “the little brown jug”—the
Judge who has sustained more attacks than
all the rest of the N. S. Wales Bench put
together, is four months older than Judge
Murray, who at 74 has just decided that he
is old enough to retire. But, then. Murray
always was a better Judge than Docker.
Three Sydney barristers who are half-
Avay up the ladder are showing what sort of
Judges they would make —Pickburn, Boyce
and Coyle. Pickburn is the favorite for the
first vacancy—caused by Judge Murray’s
retirement—but at least one other seat is
likely to be empty soon. All three are
home-grown, though Coyle has some super-
added English training.
The estate of the late Lord Clifford
of Chudleigh has been sworn at
£69,104, and the heavy English death
duties will make it a good deal less
before the mature-whiskered heir from
the Flyspeek has had a look round the old
place. Still Clifford is the sort of baron
who wouldn’t mind taking a job to make up
his proud old butler’s stipend.
An ancient named Dermody made a re-
appearance at Ballarat City Court the other
day charged at his own request with having
insufficient means of support. “With the
walls of a prison around me I would be
happy,” he said. He was not always so
content to be “inside.” Forty years or more
ago Dermody was one of the party of half
a dozen who broke out of Ballarat gaol
under the direction of “Captain Moonlight.”
As he had recently objected forcibly to the
restraint of the Benevolent Asylum, the
Bench obliged the veteran with three months
at his old home.
Dead in Adelaide, at 65, Adam Adamson,
accountant, liquidator of many companies,
and best known in private life as having got
together one of that literary city’s best
private libraries.
Yon can’t kill a sailor —you can only
drown him. Gunner (“Boxer”) Markham,
a late Imperial Navy man, was reported ill
at liabaul, missing in the Gallipoli Landing
and killed at Lone Pine. Libels, two at
least of them! He enlisted in the A.I.F. the
other day, the livest and most present dead-
and-missing Billjim that any Fritz could
hope not to meet.
In the advt. of an anti-conscription pro-
paganda meeting held at the Melbourne
Trades Hall on a recent Saturday for “revo-
lutionary unionists and P.L.G. members,”
the convener’s address was frankly given as
Coward-street, Footscray.
PAPA’S ADVICE.
“Papa, Dr. Brown-Smith told me I ought to
go away for a holiday. Where do you
think I should go?”
“To another doctor.”
Retired from the Vie. Railway service last
week. Peter Hughes, the North Melbourne
stationmaster, perhaps the only man left in
the service who had worked for the old
Hobson Bay Co. which the Government
bought out. And it was a mighty good co.
to work for, says veteran Hughes, though it
served the public pretty badly. His recol-
lections of Melbourne are interesting re-
minders of what has happened to the city
within only 56 years. He was once lost for
a day in the bush between South Melbourne
and Prahran, and was found by aborigines who
were taking opossums and native bears to
town. The Albert Park district was the
last camping ground for the blacks within
what is now the Melbourne radius. There
was virgin forest all around the lake where
naval scouts now learn the rudiments of
navigation, and black folk held corroboree
on the site now desecrated by a statue to
the late caterer Skinner.
An old bold mate of the sea passed out
when Captain W. R. Barwood died. His
halcyon days wefe with the clipper ships,
running between Australia and port o’
London town. For 83 years he was on this
run under the house flag of T. B. Walker.
The “old man’’ never had an accident until
he came to the Rock of Ages last week.
“Chudah”: Baronet Jacob Elias Sassoon,
whose death was reported a few days ago,
came of a unique family, next in wonder to
the Rothsehildren. Jacob Elias was grand-
son of David, who migrated from Bagdad
to Bombay, inspired by the example of Parsi
Zorastrian fire-worshippers, and did better
than any of them. His son Albert, another
alert gentleman, founded the London branch
of the business. He became a baronet in
IS9O, and rivalled Hirsch and Cassel in
entertaining Edward Prince of Wales, both
in London and Brighton. But Rube, Albert’s
younger brother, was even a more expansive
host. Jacob Elias was the boss at Bombay,
which was always regarded as headquarters.
He obtained an independent baronetcy in
1909. The family stretches over Bagdad,
Shanghai, Japan and United States.
The loyal Australians of old German name
in S. Aus. are paying a heavy toll. George
Reinecke (lately Chief Clerk in the Tram-
ways Trust) left Adelaide as a sergeant, and
earned his commission in the field a month
or two before he was killed. He was the
only son of C. A. Reinecke, himself also Aus-
tralian born, auditor for the Broken Hill
Prop. Co.
Sam See, a Huntingdonshire man, died
in Sydney last week after a long Jllness.
His family came to Australia in 1853 and
settled on the,Hunter, where, they farmed.
There were four brothers, one of whom was
John, a former N.S.W. Premier. The Sees
later on settled on the Clarence, where they
commanded the trade of the river. John
engaged in shipping business in Sydney,
while the brothers looked after the interests
of the firm of Nipper and See on the North-
ern Rivers. With Sam gone, but one of the
four, it is understood, remains.
“Kai-Pia”: An early victim of the anti-
“shouting” regulation in Maoriland was
Mita Taupopoki, the boss man of the Tuhou-
rangi tribd, in the village of the geysers,
Whakarewarewa. Old Mita is a picturesque
figure of Rotorua —a tall, white-bearded
patriarch, with a wild eye and a tremendous
flow of poetic oratory, lie has a beautiful
carved house at Whakarewarewa; he can
reel off his pedigree for five-and-twenty
generations; he carried carbine and toma-
hawk for Queen Wikitoria in Te Kooti’s
rebellious days, and he has wagged an in-
credibly agile tongue in the cause of Maori
recruiting for the present war. Now this
patriot of patriots has to fork out £2O for a
breach of the Jimmy Woodser law. It’s a
great country. May its fads increase and
multiply so that the neighbors be not down-
hearted and the ribald continue to go about
their business!
“Loco”: A word in favor of the just-dead
C. Alison Smith, the Maorilander who
helped to make Speight an expensive rail-
way commissioner for Victoria. Perhaps
Smith did scrap too much rolling stock. But
he could build as well as destroy. His “Y,”
“RY” and “AA” locomotives are to-day
doing good work, though nearly 30 years
old. Many a driver has blessed the name of
Alison Smith, as he struggled up Oliver’s
bank, on the North-east, or Sunbury, on the
Main line. When he had an “RY” under
him he knew “she” could do it if anything
could. Ask any driver to-day to take his
choice between a “Y” and a “HD” for a. load
of goods to Woodend. and the “DD” will be
left in the shed every time. Some future
Alison Smith will scrap the “DD” and
“A 2” locomotives before they have dione
nearly the work of the old “Y,” “RY” and
“AA” classes. And the relative cost of
repairs? Well, ask any running shed
mechanic about that!
Just-retired N.S.W. District Court
Judge Murray started his law career as

NATURALLY DISAPPOINTED.

And timorously cry:
“’Ole ’Oppy ’Opkins! ’Oppy ’Op!”
Then turn about and fly.
Her face is like a guarded rose,
Her hair all Autumn dyes,
Her brown eye with the ardor glows
Of awesome enterprise,
And in her face sweet impishness
With mortal terror vies.
“’Ole ’Oppy ’Op!” She chatters much
As raffish boys have done,
For moving- round upon a crutch
I dot and carry one.
I dimly in my corner sit,
While she is in the sun.
I sew the kip, and see the glow
Of sun and swelling tree,
And love the wind, the water’s flow,
The spaces wild and free,
Yet in the open I am as
A swimmer to the sea.
“ ’Ole ’Oppy ’Opkins! ’Oppy ’Op!”
She stares in at the door,
But scampers from the bogey shop
In fearful joy before
She rouses that be-whiskered shape
That wields the arm of Thor.
And so ’tis for the goblin grim
I feel a lasting woe,
Not for the Princess seized bv him
Because he loves her so,
With love that all ye shapely things
Well-loved can never know.
She is to me all sweetness born,
Tlie sun g’od’s radiant spark,
The scent and color of the morn,
The music of the lark;
And to the wonder-child I am
The ogre in the dark. !
BOB THE COBBLER.
AN ODE TO MYSELF.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My Hide-aiiil-Seelc I’ve endured with you,
And I fancy I know you through and through ;
You have tempted me in the vacant night
That we would be kings, which, of course, was skite.
The castles you built for my gladdening eyes
Were as solid, my fraud, as Magenta's sighs.
I once knew an optimist, keen and sweet,
Who walked on his hands instead of his feet;
But time moves on, much as time will do,
And you couldn’t cheat me, my Little Boy Blue.
So, knowing ourselves, I think you’ll agree
That the properest ending for you and for me
Is to fill ourselves with a Springtime breath
And laugh and laugh ourselves to death.

Banks, like other people, are getting the
temporary benefit of the splashing around of
borrowed money. We are doing the thing
properly, and in order to make ourselves
believe we can afford it. we are pulling our
own legs mercilessly. There is, apparently,
no serious attempt to realise that the present
“prosperity” is bogus—that we are going
gay on our own lOtJ’s. But while the banks
will suffer, more or less, when the lOU’s
have to be cashed, they probably will not
suffer heavy losses Of principal; and if they
escape that they escape the worst that can
happen to a bank. For in spite of the bogus
prosperity there has been no boom at all in
real estate. On the contrary there has been
a gradual shrinkage, as of course there
should have been, ever since the great
trouble came upon us. True, advances have
been made also upon merchandise, directly
and indirectly, at inflated prices. But a
pretty wide margin is generally required
when such securities are on the- table ; and,
anyway, there is not going to be an instant
readjustment of prices when the war ends.
For one thing, the world’s reduced shipping
will be pretty busy for a while on another
job.
Chiefly as the result, then, of prudent
management, this paper doesn’t look for any
heavy banking losses, though it looks for
reduced banking profits. The latter feature
will, however, be largely governed by the
behavior of the markets for our products;
and previous experience on that point isn’t
worth tuppence. There is one writer, though,
who will be surprised if things remain in a
bad way for very long. Commercially a uni-
versal war wouldn’t be as bad as a universal
drought. In a drought, not only is there a
stoppage of production, but the machinery
of production —the live stock —is destroyed.
There is comparatively little of that in war.
On the contrary, in some directions the
machinery of production is vastly improved.
We shall find it so with regard to several of
our manufactures; and Germany will cer-
tainly find it so. That indeed is one strong
argument in favor of the levying of indemni-
ties from an apparently-smashed enemy.
.Germany may, after all, have done a bad
thing for herself when she proceeded to bleed
France after the last great war; for the re-
sult showed how much an apparently outed
country can be bled.
The Royal’s ’-figures have undergone con-
siderable change during the year:—
Sept., ’l5. Sept., ’l6.
Notes in circulation £953 £BBO Dec. £73
Billsincirculation, etc. 276,452 161,519 Dec. 114,933

Advances . . . . 1,840,142 2,231,438 Inc. 391,296
Premises . . . . 83,090 83,815 Inc. 725
On the whole, those changes don’t look too
goad. Liquid assets have been reduced to
£043,661; and as the bank owes the public
£2,678,923, its liquid resources are reduced
to 35 p.c. of the deposits, etc. But, while
that isn’t a shockingly low proportion in
any case, the reduction is not so serious as
it seems because the bank has only about
£lOO,OOO less actual coin, bullion and Com-
monwealth notes; the rest of the reduction
is apparently due to the disposal of public
stocks —other than Commonwealth loans —
in 'order to make the money available for
clients ; and for such a policy there is a great
deal to be said just sow. Hundreds of
people have simply dumped their money into
banks to wait till the clouds roll by.. They
will do nothing with it themselves; and it
isn’t safe for banks, holding it on such a
tenure, to do much with it either. It would
suit the banks and the country better if
these people relieved the banks of some of
their State and municipal holdings, and thus
put the money at the disposal of somebody
who is prepared to do something with it.

There lias been a much sturdier growth of
business "than of immediate profits, because
expenses have been abnormal, partly on
account of extra taxation, partly because this
co. is doing the fair thing by the one-fourth
of its staff who are in khaki. This little com-
parison shows the rapid changes that have
been taking place:—-
*■ Gross Salaries, Fees Taxes and
Earning's. and Bonuses. Office Charges.

1915 .. 14.515 6102 1501
1916 . . 16,988 7548 2716
The increase in the interest earnings of
money has no doubt been a factor in im-
proving the gross earnings; but the most
important element has been the growth of the
business. In 1910 there was £3,029,970 at
credit of estates under administration ; there
is now £4,083,196 administered by the co. as
trustee or executor and £467,920 as agent.
And it looks as though the figures will con-
tinue to move along briskly. The State office
has been in operation a year or two now,
and a third trustee co. has come into the N.
S. Wales field. Nevertheless, instead of show-
ing’scars, the Permanent reports that “the
new trust and agency business for the 12
months amounts to upwards of £600,000.”
There is a very large amount of Fat man’s
business that never will go to the State
office. All the same, the Fat man won’t mind
quoting the State office when he is bargain-
ing as to whether he ought to be charged' an
or less. That’s probably where
tin# Existing trustee cos. will feel State com-
petition most; for the State office is not even
permitted to make money—it must reduce its
charges to cost price.
The co.’s own funds are either on deposit
with the Government or in the very fine new
premises of which the co. occupies a part.
The co. has £23,103 on mortgage—most of it
perhaps temporary advances to estates, but it
.apparently arranges an overdraft to provide
for that. Here are the figures:—

In addition to the security offered to clients
by the co.’s solidly-invested capital, share-
holders are liable to be called on for another
£950,000. But, though those figures are very
comforting, the man who proposes to let this
co. handle his affairs when he is too dead to
do it himself, has a better protection still—
(1) in the fact that the co.’s prosperity
depends entirely upon the way it does its job ;
(2) in the other fact that the men who do
the work are trained as specialists. And you
can’t say either of those things about the
casual or friend-of-the-familv trustee.

“Trade improved,” the directors say, with a
note of astonishment, “notwithstanding the
great difficulty in procuring supplies and
further heavy increases in the cost of goods,
freights, etc,” They really mean : “We did
a bigger business, though wo had to pop on
the prices to make up for increased costs,
with a hit over to cover our risks and for
the good of our health.” And the risks, on
paper at any rate, are not small. A lot of
the co.’s business is done on time-payment
terms; and that means very— large book
debts. As the co. has gone in extensively tor
shop property and carries a heavy stock as
well, this has meant leaning on creditors as
follows ■ ■ ' •

The increase of book debts in the present
uncertain state of the world is courageous ;
and so is the very big holding of stock.
Admittedly, nevertheless, under all previously
known conditions the losses on time-payment
business have been astonishingly small; and,
further, there isn’t likely to be any very
sudden collapse of the bubble of prosperity
which is being blown to a great size by the
expenditure of war and other loans. That
is all to the good of this co. and the time-
payment business on its books;
When sub-normal conditions of trade
presently arrive this co. will be in a better
condition than most to continue its present
dividends. Its margin of undivided profit
has always been wide enough to fill this
paper with admiration. In 10 years it has
put by £116,000 —an average of about 5} p.c.
p.a. on the present ordinary capital of
£200,000. Besides that there is £150,000 of
pref. capital; but that is limited to 6 p.c.

The directors are still proud that they pay
the dividend on the original capital, and they
say so in big black letters, no doubt because
it would cost more to do it in red. It is
something worth being proud of, too; for
the Langridge. being nearly 40 years old,
went through the land boom. Now the direc-
tors don’t propose to risk their reputation,
wherefore they work on most conservative
lines. The trouble which struck Australian
building societies in the ’nineties arose from
the fact that they had borrowed heavily and
couldn’t afford, to nurse their securities. So
this office fights shy of deposits, and, being
thus under no obligation to pay out, is
under no obligation to sell when the pro-
perty market is unfavorable. The following
little table shows its total liabilities alongside
its assets :—■
Deposits, Fore- Other
etc. Advances, closures. Assets.
1905 .. £12,229 £59,172 £54,245 £3678

1916 . . 20,229 110,235 3,929 1012
So it owes only £20,229, including unclaimed
dividends, and has more than seven times
that much in assets. Further, very few of
the advances are new; and it is the new
advance that is apt to be thrown in when
adversity strikes a community. The really
astonishing thing is that the society should
be able to make so good a profit out of build-
ing-society business in these days of State
Savings Bank loans without taking more
risks. It wouldn’t be at all possible but
for the Langridge’s excellent reputation and
its economical management.

There isn’t enough evidence there to convict
war of causing depression. But to assume
that a country can become really prosperous
by keeping one-fourth of its men out of pro-
ductive jobs, and paying them for not earn-
ing a bean in the commercial sense, and
spending millions of pounds on things for
them to waste (in the economic sense)— to
imagine you can do that and be prosperous
on account of it is quite insane, it is no
more possible for a country to become really
prosperous that way than it is for a business
to become prosperous by sending off one-
fourth of its hands on holiday on full wages
and paying their train fares and boat tickets,
and providing for their keep, and supplying
them with a motor-car and 10,000 rounds
of ammunition each to shoot at something
that is no good' to eat. lienee if anybody
thinks that the- present figures of trading
cos. are normal, and are likely to be the
figures of a couple of years hence, he is
booked, this paper fears, for a horrible dis-
appointment.
This co. will not have much to complain
about even if profits slump 25 p.c. or so.
It would "still show well over 15 p.c. on its
present capital of £180,000; and of that
capital £30,000 has been transferred from
reserves. Further, the results over a long
range of years entitle the shareholders to
expect something very good in normal times
later on, even if profits are rather badly hit
in the depression that is likely to arrive soon.
Look at this evidence of solid progress :

All that £62,605 added to property and
£27,2,51 added to stock has come from undi-
vided profit, except as to £30,000 got from
shareholders ; and meantime the dividend has
ranged from 10 to 25 p.c. It is a really
wonderful performance when it is taken
into account that the retail drug trade is not
one in which fortunes are easily picked up.
No doubt even in this case it would be
found that the side-lines have most to be
thanked for.

Nominally there is £48,500 of a reserve, but
against that £BO,OOO of the capital, is still
represented by froth called goodwill. But
whether the co. has all the capital
(£250,000) intact and £18,500 besides de-
pends wholly upon the valuation of the
assets. Apparently it is all right ; at any
rate, about four years ago the assets were
sampled and were actually written up. Yet
if the assets are really worth this money,
they might reasonably be expected to pro-
duce a better average profit. The investor has
been offering only 12s. for the 20s. share for
months past. The price is governed evidently
by the dividend paid; it is pretty clear that
the market doesn’t take very much notice
either of the alleged value of the assets or of
the £27,000-odd profit shown in 1014 and
1915.
There are, in fact, several mysteries about
this concern and the outsider has pretty well
given up the attempt to fathom them. Once
or twice he may have thought he touched
bottom ; but he has soon been floundering
again. Still there seem to be one or two
reasonable conclusions. But first take this
comparison :

Properties and goodwill now are £267.497.
Five years ago they were £263,400. Thus
there has been practically no fresh capital
outlay on properties, plant, etc.; yet the
other figures show that the co. has
achieved a very substantial increase of
business. That is the point of most
importance. In connection with a brew-
ery it isn’t much use figuring out what the
assets are worth. They depend for most of
their value upon what they can earn. Here,
with good management, the prospects seem
all right. There is no reason to expect that
anything will happen to send Newcastle to
the Band of Hope. It is going to be a big

“The increased dairy and agricultural out-
put as anticipated in last report,” say the
directors, “did not result owing to the dis-
trict experiencing very dry conditions during
the greater part of the half-year.” So the
disclosed net profit has dropped slightly
below* the figures of the previous half-year.
But whether it expresses the true net profit
earned depends entirely on what has been
allowed for depreciation, and this co. pro-
vides no evidence on that point. Maybe the
directors have allowed for more than ample
depreciation and the net profit is unduly
shrunken in consequence. But the co. is not
likely to disclose anything sensational in its
ballast. From an earning point of view it
is apparently little better off than it was 10
years ago. Look at these figures :

So in the matter of net liquid assets the co. .
is about £27,000 worse off than it was 10
years ago, and it shows hardly any better
net profits. Or put in another way, in order
to maintain its profits at somewhere about
the old level it has had to draw on its liquid
assets to the extent of about £27,000, which
amount has been mostly put into vessels.
It isn’t at all a brilliant record.

“The Palmer interest” has controlled the
Broken Hill Junction North for very many
years', and has succeeded in producing a
hundred promises but no dividends for the
last five years and only six during this cen-
tury. A majority of the directors have now
got tired of the promises and have rebelled,
so a movement is on foot to get rid of them.
If the shareholders like promises and no
dividends they will sack the rebellious direc-
tors. If they don’t, they will do the other
thing.
In effect the fight is to settle, not so much
who are to be directors, but who is to be
general manager. The position is now and
has for many years been held by one of the
Palmers. Some or all of the directors who
think that dividends are a fair thing are
known to favor a change —-probably in the
direction of putting the whole concern under
the control of Bewick, Moreing and Co.,
who manage the Zinc Corporation and have
made a success of the South Blocks, which
had previously been almost as great a disap-
pointment as the Junction North. In reply
it is contended that there is no occasion to
make a change—that (for the 495th time or-
thereabouts) the mine is just on the verge of,
paying dividends. The Bulletin is unable
to find any proof of it. The whole position
is so interesting, and incidentally throws a
light on the terms on which silver-lead smelt-
ing is done, that it is worth going into.
The Junction North has two sources of
supply—dumps of slimes which it has
bought from other cos. for about £BO,OOO
and a small quantity of ore still left in its
own mine. The latter has not been drawn
upon for some time, and the specially-erected
treatment works have been employed on the
slimes. From these slimes, which are worked
by the Bradford process, a lead concentrate
is produced and sold to the Associated
Smelters. Now, it is admitted that on pay-
ments actually made no profit is shown ; but
it is alleged that profits are being banked
up. It therefore becomes necessary to look
into the contract between the Associated
Smelters and the Junction North. This
agreement is for the purchase by the former,
for a nominal term of 50 years, of “mean
leady concentrates produced solely by -jig-
ging, tabling or vanning direct from crude
ore, and shall not include concentrates pro-
duced from slime, or by any other system
of concentration than the aforesaid.” The
acceptance of concentrates derived from
slime by a flotation process is therefore a
matter of special arrangement; and the
smelters are entitled to penalties—as, for
instance, for excess zinc, which is a detri-
ment to silver lead ore. (“The purchaser
may make a sliding scale of lines and allow-
ances as it may think fit to cover the varia-
tion in grade, constituents and character of
concentrates.”) The charges under the
agreement amount to about 1445. per ton,
including railage to smelters. The procedure
is as follows. The co. delivers the concen-
trates at Port Pirie. The smelters estimate
their gross value. Pro forma recoveries of
90 p.c. of the lead and 98 p.c. of the silver
are assumed ; and 90 p.c. of the gross value,
less charges, is paid at once. Thus 10 p.c.
is held back for final settlement. Payment
has been made at the rate of £25 for lead and
2s. for silver; that is to say, £25 per ton
and 2s. per oz. less 10 p.c. It is claimed
that, as the markets have been higher than
those figures, more than 10 p.c. of the total
amount already received will be available
presently : and this constitutes the “profit
which is being allegedly banked up.
Nobody knows whether there will be a
penny more to be drawn or not. There pro-
bably'will be something—perhaps £2 per ton
of lead and Gd. per oz. of silver; but nobody
can be sure of even that. For these points
have to be taken into account: —
(1) Final payments are made, not on prices at time
of delivery, but on “the average price obtained by the.
purchaser (the smelter co.) over the whole of its
sales for the half-year.”
(2) If any of the smelter charges have been under-
estimated, the purchaser will deduct the amount from
the final payment.
(3) Ditto as to fines and penalties —as, for in-
stance, for zinc contents.
(4) Ditto in the event of the smelter failing to
recover 90 p.c. of the lead and 98 p.c, of the silver.
(5) Ditto in the event of the smelter co. not aver-
aging £25 for lead and 2s. for silver; and there is
no obligation on the co. to sell the metals in any one
period. The co. may not have disposed of the whole
of the product yet.
On the first four months’ output after the
works were restarted ,it would appear that
there was a loss, on the manager’s estimate,
of £2904, without allowing anything for
depreciation. There seems, however, to have
been an over-valuation of the lead contents,
which would bring the total loss to about
£3lOO, exclusive of depreciation. If the
extra £2 per ton and 6d. per oz. before men-
tioned are realised, the co. will get about
£3900. The £2O0 —the difference between
the two figures—would not nearly make a
fair provision for depreciation of plant. On
these figures there will be no net profit .what-
ever, but a substantial loss.

The law is a wonderful institution. . The
Silver Peak Mining Co.’s N. S. Wales leases
were cancelled because of a breach of condi-
tions, and the land became open for leasing
on a certain date. At 10 o’clock on that day
the contending parties pegged the blocks.
The warden then sat to decide who was to
get them. Experts in horology went from
Sydney to give evidence about time ; experts
on chronometers gave evidence about clocks ;
eminent counsel argued for three long days.
After they were j all finished the Mining
Warden calmly dismissed all the applica-
tions because not one of them had asked for a
“mining lease” as required by the. Act.
When all hands recovered their senses from
this shock there was a stampede from the
court and a wild rush to peg out the leases
again by the light of a feeble moon.

Option hunters are having a look around
Mt. Monger (W.A.), but at present the field
offers no attractions to the public. A
crowd of Bulong- dryblowers got some shallow
alluvial and a few reefs there about 20 years
ago, but the scarcity of water and greater
scarcity of gold ultimately drove them away.
Recently gold was found in some small veins,
but signs of permanency are still wanting.

Great Boulder is gradually wasting away,
with no hope of recovery. Ivanhoe still
hazards on getting out of the porphyry in-
trusion and meeting with good ore again. It
recently put in a drill at the 8620 ft. level,
but beyond striking one or two good-grade
stringers, results were disappointing. Lake
View and Star is in poor condition. The
management talks of things righting them-
selves, but there is not much to justify this
optimism. Perseverance is on its last legs,
unless a miracle happens. Associated’s mill
is kept going by burrowing here and
there. Kalgurli expects to pass out towards
the end of next year, and there isn’t likely
to be much left of the Oroya Links by that
time. South Kalgurli still makes profit out
of poor stuff and is all right. It, however,
has nothing to look forward to at depth and
is gradually using up its resources. Except
a few hand-to-mouth ventures at the extreme
north and south ends of the belt everything
else on the field is down and apparently out.

T. 11. Williams, once of Marvel Loch fame,
is now running Leonora Blocks, Leonora
(W.A.). Broker Marriott is his special
admirer, so when he picked on Leonora
Blocks as a promising proposition. Marriott
wrote the foreword that clinched the option
and brought in the ,public. To the outsider
Leonora looks to be- a patchy show even on
Williams’s painting. Still he counts up to
14,000 tons as proved on three sides at the
400 ft. level east. This ore gives values at
150 ft., and in the underlie shaft of 50s. and
along the 400 ft. level of 80s. To the west
4000 tons are standing and the shoot seems
to average 4ft. in width. So the battery
should be able to make a pretty splash for
the next 12 months provided the stone mills
to Williams’s sampling. With things run-

Kampong Kamunting has taken fright—
and flight. Willing enough to pay one lot of
taxes it wasn’t prepared to pay two or
three, so .it is winding itself up here and
registering with exactly the same number of
shares, etc., in the Malay States (British),
where the mine is.
■ Briseis (Tas.) handed out a sixpenny
(£15,000) last June, and there is talk of
another before the end of the year. Still ils
net profit for nine months to September 30
was only £20,000. For the last quarter the
net profit was £7OOO and the output .80 tons
of metallic tin, with gold from the Wallace
dredging property (Vic.) The
revenue for the. whole of .this' .year isn’t
likely to exceed £BO,OOO, of which £58,500
will represent tin values; and practically all
the anticipated profit of £27,'000 ■ for. the 12
months must come from this source. During
the last quarter the Wallace gold dredges
turned over 314,900 cub. yds. and recovered
gold worth £5044. But the average yield
has fallen below 4d. per yd., so profits are
cut fine.
* * * *
A sale of Austral Bolivia ss. shares at
40s. indicates that Sydney speculators have
been impressed by the enthusiastic reports
on this S. American tin property. But while
the outlook is excellent the conditions men-
tioned in reports are exactly those calcu-
lated to deo«ive the most careful prospector.
An average from the surface of 71b. of black
tin per cub. yd. is very rich, and half the
tin scratchers in Australia would rush to
Bolivia if they were quite sure of it.
“Gadgett” on mine ventilation and other
problems:—■
“Paddymelon” asks (B. 12/10/T6) “what is wrong
with applying the principle of the vacuum-cleaner
for ridding mines of dust, etc. ?” There is nothing
at all wrong with the idea, though it is not neces-
sary to use it with rock drills. The water jet is
just as efficient, and is much cheaper and handier.
But for ventilating rises and “dead ends”' there is
nothing to beat.it. The smoke, fumes,, etc., are
drawn away instead of being sallowed to drift through
the mine, and the miner is spared the annoyance of
a head buzzing like a swarm of bees. Various ex-
haust fans have been put on the market, all of them
more or less efficient, but only in rare instances are
they used. The whole reason is that they cost some-
thing. True, in some cases, it may be trifling and
the compensating advantages are out of all propor-
tion thereto ; nevertheless mine owners and managers
are incredibly reluctant to do anything that would
add another penny to their costs. Only the man who
has worked in a “dead end” aftpr a heavy firing-out
knows how bad the fumes of the exploded nitro-
glycerine compounds are, particularly if the firing is
in sulphide ores. For hours after the rock drills
start work the air reeks; but as long as the miner
will put up with it (force of circumstances gener-
ally compels him to), the manager will not dream of
adding to his costs the expense of a decent ventilat-
ing system.
This devotion to the god of Costs is carried to
absurd extremes. Unbelievable though it may seem,
it is nevertheless a fact that one of the principal divi-
dend-paying mines in Tasmania begrudges the neces-
sary drill steel for the rock drills, and it is nothing
uncommon for machines to be hung up for hours at a
time because of insufficient supplies. The energies
of the whole staff, from g.m. to pannikin boss, are
directed to reducing costs, and they all become so
absorbed in the occupation that many other import-
ant and advantageous things are completely over-
looked. For instance, suppose a mine shaft to he
500 ft. deep, with pump chamber or cistern on the
bottom level and the whole mine draining thereto.
There are five levels all connected and many dead-
ends where the air currents do not circulate. Suppose
on (say) the 200 ft. level there is a steady flow of
water from a bore-hole, or country break or vugh
this water flows to the bottom level before it reaches
the pump. If a small tank were built where the water
comes out of the rock and the water were piped to
the bottom level the pressure there would be about
1301 b. to the square inch. Then a I-inch nozzle
and a 2ft. Pelton wheel would be all that would be
required -to drive a fair-size exhaust fan, which
could he used for ventilating the rises and “dead-
ends” to the manifest benefit of the men working
there. I have seen many places where this scheme
could be worked, but have never yet seen it tried.
We badly want a clause in our Mining Acts similar
to one in the South African code. “No shift boss shall
enter or cause any other person to enter any rise,
winze, stope or other working place, while smoke
or fumes are perceptible to sight, smell or any other
of the senses. Penalty £50.” With such a regula-
tion, combined with rigid inspection, mine owners
would ventilate the “little hells” that are unfortu-
nately so common.
* * * *
Owing mainly to increased costs, which
in this industry can’t be passed on, Aus-
tralia’s gold yield for the first three quarters
of 1916 was over 216,,0000z. short of that
for the previous year. Victoria produced
55,5940 z. less; Westralia 108,3550 z,, N. S.
Wales 33,1930 z. and Bananaland 17,4140 z.
less. The Speck and S. Aus. don’t matter.
* * * *
S’African gold and diamond mine-owners
are bucking at the way their share of the
cost of the war is mounting up. Gold-
mining profits are now taxed at the rate of
16J p.c., and for the first time on record
diamonds have also to contribute when pro-
fits exceed 35 p.c. De Beer’s profit in the
past lias ranged from 60 p.c. to 100 p.c.
No dividend has, however, been paid during
the past two years. But if, as alleged, the
co. controls the market in the matter of
demand, supply and prices, it could easily
pay nothing one year and a thumping div.
the next. Abe Bailey remarks sadly that
South Africa is no longer the sanctuary of
the capitalist.

HOW TO RUB OFF FAT.
CIRCULAR MOTION NECESSARY.
An excess of fatty tissues on hips or abdo-
men not only prevents one from looking well
or feeling comfortable, but it is likely to
keep increasing until all the youthful beauty
of the figure is gone. A very simple yet
wonderfully effective means for quickly and
permanently reducing this superfluous flesh
consists in applying night and morning, rub-
bing with a circular movement, a harmless
herb mixture composed of one dram of quas-
sia chips and three ounces of cirola bark
extract, which you can get at small cost
from any good chemist. Put the quassia
chips in a pan and pour over them a teacup-
ful of boiling water; in about half a minute
strain through a cloth and add the cirola
bark extract, when it is ready for use. This
recipe is also very valuable for reducing
double chin, puffy neck, arms, hands, etc.
The fat shrinks _ away rapidly, leaving no
wrinkles or flabbiness.
CAUTION. —Be sure and apply on both
hips or both arms, for a difference in one of
them would soon he noticeable if the lotion
were only used on one side. — Apvt.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, October 30, 1916.
My Dear Akim. —
The G.-G., like the Indian Viceroy, has
the special perquisite of handing the Com-
panionship of Michael and George and simi-
lar baubles to the new owners. 1 fancy
his Ex. can even in an emergency slap his
walking-stick on the shoulder of a brand-new
knight and tell him to x’ise up Sir Mama-
duke. Sydney’s veteran champion of the
Kiddies’ cause, Dr. Charles Mackellar, forti-
fied by the mineral waters of Moree, took
his Iv.C.M.G. from the G.-G. at Admiralty
House. On the same afternoon the lathy
Peter Board came up for his C.M.G.—a sort
of good-conduct prize in the infant class.
Director Maiden, of the Botanic Gardens, got
away with an 1.5.0. on this gift afternoon.
The Red Cross dames had a new force to
shake them into smiles (even the dismal
Jennies looked more pleasant) when Lady
Galway came to Sydney. She tosses off a
graphic picture of Red Cross work while the
ordinary feminine orator is feeling for sta-
tistics. At the big Town Hall meeting the
other afternoon the lady from S’Australia
held the crowd with her picturesque prose.
For instance: “Before long may morning
break and the women of Australia catch the
joyous footfall of the victors’ homeward
march!” I understood the lady to also
say that she still believed the Grape State
made the best shirts for the Red Cross, with
immovable buttons.
There’s no connection, I believe, between
the Miss Macaulay who shadows Lady Gal-
way as friend, secretary and so on, and
the family of famous Tom. She’s an indus-
trious letter-writer, though, like the great
namesake who wrote to sister Hannah every
day—l suppose because he couldn’t ’phone
her.
Lady Helen, in the chair at this huge
gathering, summed up'the year’s socks and
comforts. Chaplain Stewart gave the story
of the heroic Australian stand when the
Southland was torpedoed—and more than
women wiped their eyes. J. O. Fairfax, J.
J. Virgo (world’s rouseabout for the
Y.M.C.A.) and Dr. Edith Barrett (Mel-
bourne) added to the speech-making. The
Baldwin Spencer ladj r represented the lone
Northern Territory—l suppose because her
explorer knows more about the innards of
this continent than most men. Miss Mary
Strickland tools her delicate mother’s place
at this Hip Hooray for ourselves.
The Lads of the Village, with secretary
Budge, YV. G. Layton, Consett Stephen and
a few more, gave A.D.C. Boulton a good-bye
party. Dinner at Paris House, then to see
the Follies at the Tiv., and supper in the
Phillip-street snuggery to wind up with.
Next evening they saw the boy off for Mel-
bourne by the express. And just as the
engine was making its final noises the boy
found he’d left everything he wanted most —
ticket, passport, money, etc. —at Government
House. The stationmaster let him go on —
with a caution—and the Lads dashed back
to get the indispensables and send them on
by the later train. Youth has its long, long
thoughts, I suppose. And they don’t include
passports.
Lady Edeline Strickland is head of the
Red Cross in this State, and in spite of
illness contrives to keep in touch with all
the big centres. The party at Govern-
ment House the other afternoon was a
gentle reminder to all and sundry that there
is a final voice in executive matters. Some
of the top ladies are said to have needed the
prod rather badly.
Three hundred or more Red Crossers over-
flowed the drawing-room and drifted into
the ballroom. No, it wasn’t dancing! Mrs.
Blaxland was the lady-marslial in charge of
damsels at a long line of spinning-wheels.
His Ex. has put still another of these
machines together for the Eldest Daughter.
The latest has a treadle like a sewing-
machine, and I forget how many miles of
wool it’s supposed to turn out to the square
half-hour.
Soldier Finn, with daughter Kathleen—a
voluntary who passed round the cake —helped
the party. The Creswell lady, Mrs. Bage
(also from the southern city), the tall
Onslow family, Miss Yeo (Yass) and Mrs.
Douglas Gilfillan (Wentworth Falls) came
to Sydney for the event. Prof. Andy
Stuart’s grey top-haf was in the hall. At
the Town Hall meeting, by the .way, the
dominant Scot was on the platform. But
the peri at the stairway hadn’t any sign or
token to let Mrs. Andy sit amongst the
mighty; so she turned aside and knitted
with the herd.
Getting back to the Strickland party, the
man who could have bumped the chandelier
if he’d been careless with his head was the
big McCall McGowen. He looks like a Gren-
adier Guardsman after he’s gone grey, and
marched up the drawing-room like a whole
regiment of dragoons. Mrs. Kendall looked
over the edge of some strawberries in the new
pepper-and-salt check. The Cullen lady
swelled the number of knights’ wives. The
latter are getting numerous enough to have a
suburb to themselves.
Mother Cecelia, of the Hospice for the
Dying, begs that you will set a sky-blue mark
opposite next Friday night, and spend the
evening at Paddington Town Hall, where for
one shilling you will get 10 shillings’ worth of
song and dance and elocution. Proceeds, of
course, in aid of the unsectarian hospice.
Joynton Smith, Eslick of the Palladium,
and Aid. Farrell are the kindly trio who
have been secured for the honorary offices of
chairman, treasurer and secretary.
Here is Ella
Richards, the busy
hon. sec. and smil-
ing youngwoman in
charge of the Old
Linen Depot. If
you want to lend
a hand, it’s in the
basement under
the Town H all.
Through all the
long hot weeks of
last summer, with-
out a break, Ella
stuck to her old
rags. They are no
violets, either,
though some of the
stuff arrives with
an honest smell of
soap and sunshine.
The rest? Goodness nows what it was like
when it left home. But it arrives just
ready for the dustbin, or so dirty that the
washing of it is a mighty unpleasant busi-
ness.
Will the patriots who send rags—decent
old rags to begin with —be careful to pack
the goods in lined bags? A long train jour-
ney in the open-mesh of a sugee-sack, with
—say —a sack of potatoes on top, give un-
desirable results. The snow-white swabs
which the Old Linen girls turn out by the
thousand are from a design by an Australian
sister now at the Front. Pine sawdust pads
—healing and disinfecting—are made at the
rate of 23§0 a month, along with more or
less of everything else the surgeon wants
for dressings. In the matter of these pine
sawdust pads the matron and nurses at the
Walker Convalescent Home are big contri-
butors. I suppose they go down on their
hands and knees to a local timber man. In
Sydney Langdon and Langdon give continu-
ous supplies of the aromatic dust. Ella
Richards is, besides, hon. sec. to Red Cross
ambulance classes, and commandant of the
Double Bay V.A.D.’s, so she’s doing her bit
for the wounded Kangaroos. Now, what about
that old linen tablecloth you don’t really
want? And that lingerie can’t mend
any more?
So the large and affable gentleman, Consul
Ililmann von Goes, representative of Sweden
in these parts, is to have a few months’ fur-
lough. It’s a stormy time for a pleasure trip
to Stockholm. But perhaps it isn’t Stock-
holm.
The Dufault concert for the French, organ-
ised by little Mrs. Harry Austin, closed its
accounts last week. It was chiefly a private
subscription affair, and the French-Aus-
tralian League has £BOO 10s. 6d. as a
souvenir.
A new order to the A.I.F. overseas com-
mands that Billjim’s jaunty hat shall be let
down all round, and the sign of the rising
sun be put in front with a crown of felt for
its background. At a distance Billjim has
a chance of being mistaken for a Canuck
(which is slang for Canadian), and what
he thinks of the new regulation wouldn’t
look nice in this polite screed.
Know Mrs. Todd Helmuth, of N’York, who
is pictured amongst i other freak record-
breakers in a Yankee’ paper as “the woman
who belongs to more clubs than any other
woman in the world”? At least 100 of them
have bestowed medals on her —presumably
for being the champion dodger of the domes-
tic gas-stove. The print adds that the robust-
looking matron with the Give-me-liberty-or-
give-me-death expression is on the roll of
The Daughters of the Early Settlers of Aus-
tralia, who have broken the sequence of
medals by giving her a key. But perhaps
you don’t now The Daughters of the Early
Settlers of Australia either?
This year’s. Arts and Crafts show is just in
time for the Christmas-presents outbreak.
The Crafters have turned out leather the
half-mile. In this section M. Bamberger,
Mira Mullens, Mildred Creed, and E. Sansom
score. Ada Newman, Elza Josephson and
Ethel Atkinson have a big exhibit. Edith
Bell Brown in pottery shows what you can
do with the purple iris. Millicent Elliot is
strong in pyrography. The National Gallery
trustees think so, too, and bought her panel
with a majestic peacock spreading his tan to
the public eye. Constance Evans in wood-
carving uses the beech, the walnut and the
oak. The show, which is in the Education
Mansion, in Loftus-street, will be open till
the end of this week. One cosy corner is a
tea-room. So you can wash down the ex-
hibition with your favorite brew.
Gladys Owen, the young daughter of
Langer, K.C., is one of the fine products ot
the war. Here is a girl who, naturally shy
and sensitive, is prepared to do and dore
almost anything for the great cause, lhis
week she is entitled to complete, silence aftei
her conscription efforts in Martin Place. In
ringing tones she has been telling of those
horrible gaps in the ranks and what
should be done to fill them. There wasn’t any
craven suggestion that Indians should do it,
either. And then the electric call for the
men to show themselves —and the forest of
hands that sprang up at the call! Three
years ago if Mother had heard of her girl
doing stump-oratory at street corners, there
would have been soft lectures to celebrate, the
event. But we’ve all learnt a lot since
August, 1914.
A gentlemanly goat, the mascot of one
unit in the naval review, kept well to the
fore while his Ex. Munro Ferguson addressed
the men. The inner Domain, where the final
rally was, looked green as emerald velvet
after the recent rains. Under the flickering-
shade of newly-laundered trees, the many-
colored summer parasols —some of them are
tulips—made a gorgeous garden of silk
blooms. Commodore Henderson, R.N., who
bosses the port now that admirals must be
elsewhere, stood near his Ex. while the blue-
jackets’ band gave “A Life on the Ocean
Wave” to keep things moving. Boys fresh
from the fighting zone on the Cape station
were the heroes of this part of the parade.
Tall George Fuller handed over his niece,
Florence Christmas, of Neutral Bay, when
Cecil Scott Waine produced the plain gold
ring. The wedding was in St. James’s
Church, abloom with arum-lilies for the
event. A billowy white frock had the square-
cut neck edged with seed pearls. Lilies of the
valley, the fashionable flower of the moment,
were bunched together for the bridal posy.
Two bridesmaids, Dot Waine and N. Mit-
chell, were in foam white caught with prim-
rose ribbons. Mrs. Christmas hostessed the
party at the Carlton.
At Hazelbrook Mrs. John Sulman, presi-
dent of a Blue Mountain Red Cross League,
headed a recent successful raid for cash. The
excuse was a garden fete in the grounds of
the Hall Sanatorium. Matron Joan and the
staff assisted.
John McCormack
was heard of not
long ago from
the U.S.A.. with
Donald Mcßeath
sharing his tri-
umphs. Donald
started from be-
hind scratch. On
his first appear-
ance in Sydney he
didn’t have any
dress clothes, and
the stupid “music
critic” of a daily,
instead of giving
the shy, shivering
lad a pat of en-
couragement, merely
remarked upon his
unconventional gar-
ments. That nearly drove the sensitive
youngster to suicide. I don’t know whether
The Bulletin man heard of it or not,
but next week Donald was stood on
his feet and told of the future that
was ahead of him. It helped him on
wonderfully. Then came a bout with appen-
dicitis, which turned out another blessing.
He was taken to Lewisham Hospital, and
Mrs. John McCormack happened to be in
the same haven. The Mother Rectress con-
trived to interest her in the youth. She
passed the word on to John. John liked
him; and since then Donald (whose picture
I send you) has had a steady engagement, in
a most congenial atmosphere, with intervals
of study.
Dashing Dorothy Gordon, designer of
daring vaudeville ideas for various local
charities, has cabled her arrival in the
U.S.A., where she is about to test her brains
and endurance in film acting.
Topsy Beveridge, of the Dollar Vale clan,
is about to join up in matrimony with Cecil
Granville, who sports lieut,.-colonel in advance
of his novelettish name and D.S'.O. in the
rear. If the powers and passports permit,
the wedding will take place in Egypt, where
the ’groom (an Anglo-Australian, by the
way) awaits the coming of his bride per the
Medina. If not, then the scene will be shifted
to the shores of one-time (though I don’t
know when) Merrie England.
Also on the Medina, bound for Egypt,
travels Florence Harnett, who follows in the
footsteps of two sisters, and goes to do secre-
tarial work for a Comforts Fund with its
headquarters in the shade of Cheops and
Chephron.
Polling-day was a surprise to the timid,
who expected to see the greatest row that
ever was. In the early morning it was calm
as a procession to a prayer-meeting. Stroll-
ing up William-street the early bird saw the
early thirst with its nose gummed to the
locked doors of the corner beer-bar. And on
nearly every door was the inscription 4 \ ote
‘No’ and Keep Your Country White.” How a
nation that stands armed with a peace pam-
phlet is going to keep its country at all is
one of the mysteries the feminine brain can’t
pretend to unravel. Still, woman can’t take
much credit. It was the vote of the startled
housemaid, terrified by wicked tales of what
was coming from Asia, that gave the Noes a
tremendous lift.
Miss Scobie, whose brother fell in France
not long ago, was one of the brilliant women-
speakers of last week. She raked her. audi-
ences with the fire of a seething, patriotism
that even penetrated the tough hide of the
persistent interjector. But the fringe of the
crowd was adamant.
The State Ex. hasn’t complained audibly
of housemaid’s knee or stiff elbow since the
review on Friday. But he stood for quite
one hour with his hand to his hat while
12,000 of Australia’s best came swinging
down the street. The G.-G., with soldier
Firth at Ids heels, was at the saluting post.
The State Ex. and his young man, the nice
boy Boulton (now on his way back to per-
suade a medical board to send him again to
France), were adjacent. All sorts and sizes
in brigadier-generals —we’re getting a fine
assortment for home consumption!—the
wiry-loolcing Colonel Miller, the newly-wed
Lieut. Baldry (he married Annie Mac Kay
a few weeks ago), Skipper Cumberlege.
R.N., of the dandy ways in peace-time, and
Heaven knows who beside, ought to have
said “Yes” as the 12,000 tramped past.
A big house chuckled at the antics of the
“Barber of Seville” in the Opera House. The
boxes were full, and as usual those of the co.
who were not on the stage were watching
their friends (and otherwise) from the front.
Soprano Yisoni, Filippini and Lois sat back
to see the rogue Scamuzzi flourish a knife like
a Moorish scimitar round the lathered chin
of old Bartolo. Miss Gonsalez, in buttercup-
yellow, covered with black crossbars like a
big fly-net, had to skip about the stage in a
frock that was much too tight. Still, she
frisked considerably as the lively Rosina.
with Balboni, disguised as a Spanish black
beetle, making love under a hat the size of
a dinner-waggon. The big tenor, by the
way, was a six-foot edition of Little Lord
Fauntleroy when he warbled his serenade in
black velvet, with wide cream lace frills at
the edge of his knickers and a ditto collar.
This collar, or its mate, has appeared in so
many operas that it’s a hard-worked first-
nighter. Hilda Caro, in rose-pink, was in a
box, and the voice of the prompter was all
over the theatre.
Contralto Kate Rooney (Mrs. Billy Kirk-
ham) writes to mention her near arrival in
Sydney—probably the end of this month.
She’s been singing as well as holidaying in
Woodrow Wilson’s big kingdom. Kate brings
that much-travelled baby, Kirkham, junior,
who braved the early submarines in his
swaddling clothes, to .show grandma how he
cuts his back teeth.
Mrs. Arthur Duncan, once Alice John-
ston, of Wellington (M.L.), has been seeing
Sydney for a week or two. Her husband is
Maoriland’s pride in the amateur golfing line,
and owns handsome looks, too.
Bird Day moved on a week to avoid bump-
ing into the vote for Tommy in the trenches.
So this Friday evening the Tech. College
Hall will resound with the kiddies’ efforts
to imitate the throstle calls of Bushland.
Even the undertakery crow squawks “Yes”
when his mate calls for help, so the Gould
League will tell you.
The 3rd Battalion Comforts Fund (Mrs.
Philip Street in command) sends out S.O.S.
signals. It wants more workers to get
through a mountain of sewing to keep our
boys warm in the blizzards to come.
North and South were linked up in Lon-
don a few weeks ago, when Hilda, of the
Monaro Harnetts, was matrimonially at-
tached to Lieut. Abbott, of New England
and the Light Horse. The first meeting took
place in Cairo, where Mrs. Abbott-that-now-
is was doing secretarial work for our Red
Cross.
Paul Dufault finishes in the middle of
this week, after filling the Town Hall with
prolonged applause. Then back to Maori-
land for another farewell before boarding the
boat for North America.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

to the model of the Aeolian-Vocalion illustrated
above. Since its introduction little more than a
year ago, the Aeolian-Vocalion has attained an extra-
ordinary measure of popularity and prestige. The
recognition of its musical and artistic supremacy,
however, has been taken, sometimes to imply a high
price.
Its Art Styles are necessarily high in price. But
in the conventional models, Aeolian-Vocalions cost
no more than gramophones of the ordinary type and
may be as conveniently purchased. This is illus-
trated in the model shown above, known as Style F,
which costs but £22-10-0 and is purchasable on terms of
£5-10-0 Down and £l-11-2
a Month
Every important and 'dis-
tinctive Vocalion feature is
represented in this model.
Its case, like those of all
other models, is distin-
guished by simple elegance
of outline and richness of
finish.
It contains the scientifi-
cally developed Vocalion
Sound-Box, which produces
an entirely new perfection
of tone —full, rich, mellow
and totally devoid of stri-
dency. It contains the
exclusive and patented Sym-
phonetic Horn which ampli-
fies the tones and at the
same time preserves the dis-
tinctive beauties of all
different instruments and
voices.
It is equipped with the
Vocation Automatic Stop, the
simplest and most efficient
yet devised.
The casework is beauti-
fully finished in either Oak
or Satin Mahogany, the
lower portion of the Cabinet
forms a storage space for the
Disc Records.

GREAT DANGER OF INSECT BITES.
Protect Yourself Against Ordinary
Dangers tty Using NEV-A-BITE.
A Preparation of Proved Effectiveness.
“There is no question,” says a leading specialist,
“that insect bites may lead to great danger, to
health, and have been known to end fatally.”
The dread Mosquito,
whose bite is perhaps
the most dangerous of
all insects.
This alarming
statement, which
has appeared in
the influential
newspapers of this
country, should
arouse the public
to the fact that
bites- from mos-
quitoes and other
insects are things
to worry about.
It is quite pos-
sible that if one’s
blood is in a poor
state an insect bite
might set up such
serious inflamma-
tion as to cause blood-poisoning, and —as every-
one well knows—blood-poisoning may lead to
even the amputation of a limb.
The best form of treatment of mosquito
bites is prophylactic or preventive. The appli-
cation of a little of the NEV-A7BITE
lotion reduces the probability of mosquito bites
to a minimum.
NEV-A-BITE is a perfectly harmless
preparation, and serves to whiten, soften and
beautify the skin.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, October 30, 1916.
Mv Dear Yarrie, —
Mooroopna, that strip of irrigated orchards
that runs for several miles along the Goul-
burn River, had plenty of excitement during
the flood. Visitors at the local hotel thanked
Heaven from the balcony that their rooms
were upstairs. They woke in the morning
to find the woodheap knocking softly at the
back door, and every kind of queer flood-
creature dodging about in the surrounding
lake. All hands and the cook had been
driven upstairs by the flood waters, which had
submerged* even the water-tanks. If you
wanted such a thing as water the muddy
flood had to be dipped up, boiled and
then strained to rid it of the dead cat from
next door and the drowned rabbits of two
miles up. The hotel family got out the
field-glasses and saw cattle standing knee-
deep in wafer on top of a distant knoll. They
made out the family cow among the group
and tried to milk her by wireless, but failed.
Soon Strawberry (or perhaps it was Daisy)
separated herself from her friends and began
to swim down the road. The faithful old
soft-drinkefy swam round the back of the
hotel, paddled in at. the back gate and
splashed to her old bail, where she waited
(up to her neck in water) to be milked.
Unfortunately, her owners didn’t possess a
diving-dress and hadn’t the materials to
build a coffer-dam round the unfortunate-
beast. So, when her patience was ex-
hausted, she swam away again to the knoll
and made a speech about it.
The event of the week for cafe-haunting
and broom-dodging dames was the opening of
the new Vienna wing. The Vienna has now
spread into what used to be Glen’s music
shop, and Griffin, the Federal Capital
designer, is supposed to have inspired the
decorative scheme. Tillars of gold bricks
hold up fried-egg frescoes. The lights are
hidden, and that which might have been
diffused amber light resolves itself into
crude mustard-colored ceilings. Huge bronze
round bowls (very new) are perched on
overhanging ledges. The waitresses wear
mustard-colored linen pinnies over white
frocks, and their Dutch caps dance on well-
frizzed hair. At the foot of the gold-brick
pillars are gold tubs of growing ferns with
real fountains playing among them. But
the cafe haunters groaned with one accord,
“What’s the good of the Vienna without the
comfy leather sofas?” All the elegant time-
wasters and nose-painters loved to drift in
for tea gossip on the leather lounges that
commanded the room.
Weedon, accompanied by a gold-mounted
umbrella and a white-and-amber wife, made
a speech at Lucas, and Lucas made a speech
back, while a squadron of Lucas daughters,
magnificently dressed, supported Mrs. Lucas
in neat black and a defiantly homely air.
She seemed to be saying: “You can have
your frill if you like, but please leave me
out of it.” The chief worry about the new
lounge is that the pillars block the view.
You can never see just who comes in with
the other cat. But perhaps the pillars have
been put in for that reason. The entrance
is made of more gold bricks under a granite
archway. It looks like a cross between a
church door and the front of Aladdin’s cave.
All the fashionables walked the Block carry-
ing their invitation cards like shields. The
giant pasteboards were about a foot square,
faced completely with gilt, the lettering in
white.
' At Colac, where the sheep swarm in a
thousand paddocks and fatted farmers
occupy the rest of the country, the local
medical help is mostly of the old-established
kind closely tied down to its job. Yet in
one way and another the physicking brother-
hood is well represented at the Front; and
now Dr. Arthur Nankervis, of a later gene-
ration, has got into a uniform and gone off
to do what he can to keep Fritz out of the
Western District for good. He left with a
kit full of good wishes.
Brigadier-General Sellheim had a welcome-
home of which he is inordinately proud.
When he reached Melbourne there were 15
children at Spencer-street station to meet
him. They rushed him with howls of glee.
The General has no youngsters of his own,
but his playfellows are always children.
One small daughter of a military man here
said despairingly, “It’s no use; he’ll be too
grown up to play with now, because he is a
brigadier-general.” But he wasn’t!
Major Rod Howe has buckled on his Sam
Brown belt again after his recent severe
illness. He is in charge of Broadmeadows,
having been forbidden further active service
abroad at present; so Hilda Greene Howe
has established herself comfortably at her
Toorak house and put the boxes away.
Mrs. Watt, who has all her three sons
and her son-in-law in France, spends her
time cutting sandwiches for Y.M.C.A. cus-
tomers in St. Kilda-road. Last week she
presented the Y.M.O.A. quarters with a
huge Union Jack which she bought at one
of the numerous auction junkets.
Mrs. Stead is giving a party next Friday
at the Repertory Club. Her captured lioness
is Major Richardson, a returned military
nurse with a lovely uniform to show. Other
returned nurses will be there and have
promised to “say • a few words”' from the
platform.
Mrs. Donald Mac-kinnon just ; waited to
vote “Yes” before speeding off to England
with elder daughter Hilary to meet the sol-
dier sons.
The Maurice Gibbs pair had hardly got
back from a health trip to Japan before they
were off to Bananaland to avoid the Vic-
torian frosts, which don’t agree with the
head of the house. Now they are returning
to their Toorak headquarters for the summer.
Mrs. Gibbs, a pretty, fragile girl, is the
daughter of one William Gordon Gumming,
Bart.
On the night of the combined school
sports, Margot Mcßean hostessed a flapper
dance-party at her mother’s South Yarra
place. On the oak-panelled ballroom walls,
which look as if they had been borrowed
from a society novel, the light and dark blue
Grammar flags hung amongst a few thousand
roses, and hostess Margot looked a dream in
early-Victorian draperies of olive silk, with
a hand-posy of little pink roses. The faith-
ful De Gilio gave a friendly smile to 20
ex-Grammarians who came up from camp
for a farewell two-step. It was a great
evening. But handsome Mrs. Norman
Faulkner was severely censured by the
youngsters for wearing a creation of purple
and gold. As soon as the boys saw it they
shouted, “Those are Wesley’s colors!”
The heroic Mrs. Campbell, who defied the
dangers of a flooded river and risked her
life to rescue hubby’s prize sheep, is none
other than the Monty Langdon widow’s
pretty second daughter Dorothy. She has
been staying at South Yarra under the
maternal wing to have her injuries attended
to. One hand won’t be out of bandages for
weeks. The lady bears her honors modestly.
The death of Andrew Loughnan at St.
Ivilda removes a popular personality and a
silvery songster. The Loughnan brothers,
Andrew and Wilfred, were squattocrats in
N. S. Wales until an endless drought
emptied their pockets. The pretty Mrs.
Andrew was Miss Mac Lean, of Edgecliff,
Sydney.
Philip Blashki died last week, aged SO.
He founded the Jewish Aid Society and was
one of the originators of the Victorian
Employers’ Federation.' Early artistic Mel-
bourne remembers son Myer, a beautiful
young man with a thick pompadour of black
hair and a not-too-pronounced. Jewish nose.
He was one of the adorers who was smiled
on by the cold and beautiful Mrs. Maesmore
Morris. Myer had romantic and artistic
yearnings and longed to live the life of a
painter. His father frowned on this idea —-
it was before the big-money days of Streeton,
Longstaff, Fox and co. Nevertheless Myer
dabbled away without dad's encouragement,
until finally he joined up with a fellow-artist
and with him worked a passage to America.
There Blashki’s good looks stood liim in
good stead and married him to a .multi-
millionairess. He soon set up a fashionable
studio in New York and had reams of notices
in the papers; whereupon father gave him
his blessing and spent his later years show-
ing friends laudatory notices of “my son.”
Justice Isaacs, his wife and Associate
daughter Nancy have trundled back to Mel-
bourne from Sydney. Duty kept dad and
Nancy there, and it happened to fit in very
well with the races. They put up at Coogee.
The Brighton Nashes had a tea-party the
other day to entertain the Bananaland Ham-
monds, Miss Conroy, of Sydney, and some
others. Young Hammond will be an aviator
presently: meantime he is engaged to Miss
Conroy, who made the Vienna Cafe haunters
stare. She entered quietly and demurely in
a navy-blue coat with the newest cartridge
pleats ; but that wasn’t what stopped busi-
ness—it was her beauty. Merely pretty
girls dropped back helpless with their
powder puffs in their hands, and ugly ones
rushed off to sue their parents.
Mrs. George Chirnside and daughter
Audrey are returning home pretty soon to
escape the London fog—and other things.
Rumor mutters that crowds of Anglo-Aus-
tralians threaten to steam back to. their
native gum-trees to elude the double income
tax. Pity the poor rich !
Melba has cancelled her projected trip to
India, her doctor having advised her to
avoid the heat. He probably saw by her
eye that she didn’t want to go there, anyhow.
Adelaide’s billet-doux: —
In response to an appeal from the Minister of
Industry, the metropolitan racing clubs organised a
patriotic race-meeting at Morphettville on Saturday,
and raked up a good cheque for the Repatriation
Fund. £72 was added to tlie collection by the
sale of Ivosai, a horse presented by A. D. McDonald
to Lady Galway. Allan Bowman bought him at
the finish. The dearest animal, woman, put on her
plainest coat and skirt, topped with a dust-coat, and
spent most of her time persuading her hat not to
take precipitate flight.
Mrs. George Aldridge and the Frank Fishers have
berths in the Medina. Mrs. Aldridge is bound for
England and the Fishers for Bombay, where their
son is. The Garrison Artillery is his little lot.
The engagement is announced of the Peter M oods’
second daughter, Joyce, to the W. B. Wilkinsons’
elder son, Keith, who has a commission in the
A.I.F. Incidentally the bride-elect’s uncle, Lieut.
W. A. Wood, who has been with the Scottish Horse
since the early days of the war, has cabled that he
is on his way to Egypt.
Died at Medindie on Saturday, Adam Adamson,
who was for years lion, secretary of the Blind
School and the Home for Incurables. He was also
a trustee of the James Brown Estate. Of his two
daughters the elder, Mrs. Barringer, is a well-known
painter of S. Australian scenery. White gums are
her specialty.
Qecil Bray, of Glenelg', is to be one of the Bed
Cross unit which is under orders for Roumania,
with Dr. O’Leary in command. Cecil left Adelaide
last year to volunteer for ambulance work, and has
since put in a useful time in France.
The proceeds of the first concert of the Adelaide
Women’s Choir are to go to the Eugene Alderman
Memorial Scholarship Fund. The date is fixed for
November 4.
A Government sanatorium for consumptive soldiers
is to be established at Bedford Park on property
bought by the Peake Government. There are about
40 such patients in our military hospitals.
Herbert Hughes, who died at Booyoolie station,
near Gladstone, last week, was a link in a family
closely identified with the early history of the State,
especially in its agricultural and pastoral develop-
ment. His wife died some years ago, and his one
daughter and sole surviving child was married about
a year ago to Roy Davidson, one of the Wigg clan.
Amadio was born to the
Pipes of Pan as some are
born to the purple. Papa
Amadio was a flautist genius
who transmitted his wiz-
ardry to his sons, more par-
ticularly John. Now John
has grown no and attained
the rank of Husband, but he
is still looked upon as the
Boy Wonder by adoring matrons and mams.
They catch this Peter Pan sometimes and feed
him with afternoon-tea at fashionable cafes.
One gushing tea-stewed dame (size five feet
high by six feet round) shrilly exclaimed
lately on one such occasion : “If I were
only a girl again, I’d be madly in love with
Amadio.”
Frederick Bevan, of the Elder Gonserva-
torium, Adelaide, naturally makes the best
defence he can against Melba’s slaughterous
criticism of the vocal education of . Doris
Beech, winner of the Melba Scholarship. As
a teacher of 20 years’ experience Bevan feels
that he “may be permitted to advise Melba
at the beginning of her career as a singing
teacher.” This attitude towards the most
gifted exponent of voice-production in the
world may bring a smile, but it won’t carry
conviction. Melba is the most famous pupil
of Marcliesi, to whom the divine fire was
handed down from Garcia the Great. Aus-
tralians are given to regarding the Queen
of Song with delightful familiarity as one
of the family. They do not all realise that
she receives the homage of the world not
only as the Voice but as the intellect behind
the Voice. Having taught Doris for five
years, Bevan thinks he should know better
than this peerless woman who only heard the
girl at the scholarship test. But what has
Bevan been teaching her for? It is not. for
the cook to say that the meal*is delicious
because she took a week to prepare it. The
connoisseur who eats it can decide that in
10 minutes. That is what the cook worked
for.
Bevan stresses the point that several great
singers began their careers on one voice and
sang their way to greatness on another. lie
quotes baritone Santley, who began as a
tenor, and the very uncertain tenor Sims
Reeves, who is asserted to have started as
a bass. But the fact is these voices sur-
vived the early mistakes. llow many others
have been ruined? Besides, Bevan is per-
haps not aware that Santley got his correct
training from Garcia, the teacher of
Marchesi.
Many Australians hope that their repre-
sentative singer will establish a Melba Con-
servatorium here. If that happened Aus-
tralia would be the Mecca of the vocal
world. The voices might come here to be
trained —as for years they went to Marchesi
and Paris.
Iris Connolly, the 10-year-old daughter
of racing-man Eric, galloped past the
winning-post in the R.M.C. examinations
last week. She carried a big weight ot
piano knowledge, and her colors were (and
are) blue eyes and golden curls. The clever
youngster has a tine platform manner. She
explained gravely to the examiner that she
had been handicapped by six weeks absence
from study helping Dad watch the Sydney
races. The win under these circs, showed
all the better form.
Melba has another scheme in hand. A
Conservatorium singing class is to be estab-
lished in Sydney, as well as Melbourne, and
the pupils will be inspected by the diva her-
self. She will make frequent trips between
Melbourne and Sydney, and look after the
girls in each capital. Fritz Hart has visited
Sydney and laid the rails.
From “Rosna,” in London :
The Australian Red Cross panjandrums on this side
have made the Australians in London rage and roar
furiously by advertising for people to “adopt” Aus-
tralian prisoners of war in Germany! There s a
general feeling that, in view of all the money we
’Roo-landers are handing- out to other nations, we
could surely spare enough to care for our own
prisoners, instead of asking strangers to do it for us.
There are 450 of them to date, and the cost is ss. a
head per week —not such an enormous liability that
wa need to hold out the hat to others. The Aus-
tralian community here can’t imagine what the
Australian Red Cross people could have been thinking
of.
Nellie Stewart has been in Melbourne on
a brief visit, daughter Nancye being at the
Royal. Incidentally, a Collins-street photo-
grapher has crowded a showcase with por-
traits of Sweet Nell, who still manages to
wear the sweet, sad look of a beauty in the
twenties. Some wretched man in court once
asked Nell her age while she stood in the
witness-box. “I was 17!” she murmured
naively.
Ruby Hooper, a young Australian, wrote
a play called “The Fair Gipsy” and staged
it at the St. Kilda Town Hall on Thursday
night. She played the leading part, stage-
managed the whole show, coached the rest
of the players, designed dances and taught
children to dance them, and added a song-
and-dance programme to the lot. She is a
popular young bundle of energy with fluffy
fair hair and a very pretty face, and two-
shilling patrons came at her bidding and
filled the Town Hall. Flappers who were
there say gushingly that the show was far
beyond “So Long, Letty” in entertainment.
That is' a criterion, for flappers simply
adored “Letty” and cherish memories of the
nights they were shouted to- the frivol.
Melba .did her bit in the Pageant at the
Playhouse. She chose nine of her singing-
girls from the Conservatorium and polished
them up for Cherry Ripe. She even stage-
managed the group and spent the afternoon
“making up” the nine young faces. A lot
of Melba’s genius consists of taking pains.
When Marlow cut his connection with the
Italian Opera Company he arranged the
details with one Carpi, an opera manager
who followed the Italians out here. Carpi
speaks English perfectly with his mouth, and
all languages with his flashing black eyes.
He is taking a company out India way w T hen
this venture pulls through.
L. K. S. Mackinnon has found a fine place
for his racehorses. He recently bought
Chatswood Park, on the Goulburn, near
Tabilk. The lovely place used to belong to
squatter Patrick Power Hickey; but after
his death the daughters sold it to trainer
Redfern, who has just completed a deal with
Mackinnon.

ROUND DARLINGHURST WAY.
Some local fashions. Hurriedly sketched by a Bulletin artist who had lost his
way in a back street of Sydney while making' for the Young Men’s Christian Association.
“Reka”: The trawlers working outside
Auckland Harbor (M.L.) bring up some strange
residents from the depths, but the queerest creature
that has yet come to light is the porcupine fish.
When properly inflated he takes the shape of a
prickly white football, with a face on one side that
is uncannily human —a wide, scarlet mouth, two
large, mournful eyes, and even the suggestion of a
nose. Collapsed, he is merely a pulpy white bag.
Nobody offers to eat him. It would seem like
cannibalism.
“Rag” : Once saw 4S mokes hauling on a
vehicle. A jinker laden with five tons of provisions
for the Oaks rush (N.Q.) got bogged in the black-
soil-and-pudding-stone flat t’other side of Quartz Hill.
The teamsters hired, borrowed, or temporarily stole
all the prads within a five-mile radius, in an
endeavor to get out of the mess. They and the 10
or a dozen others who helped them, wearing nothing
but their shirts and stockwhips, stood knee-deep in
the ooze cursing and flaying in simultaneous effort.
But the harder the nags strove the deeper the waggon
sunk. At length, recognising- the hopelessness of
the job, the crowd made camp and lingered for five
weeks until the muck stiffened.
* * » *
“Verdad”: The South American method
of yoking "bullocks can give some points to the
Australian style. Over there the bullocks are lim-
bered up fairly wide apart, by a yoke of wood shaped
to fit across the base of the horns. (No Polled Angus
need apply.) The yoke is firmly strapped to the
horns so that it is held rigid. It appears cruel, but
I have heard no complaints from the steers, and they
don't look any more worried than their brothers in
Australia. The advantages are various. ’ Two-wheeled
carts are easily controlled, and nearly all the
carts there are two-wheeled. The Chileans
do some neat work with bullocks. When heavy tim-
ber is being loaded on to a vehicle the team lower
their heads, and a chain is hitched round the logs
and on to their yoke. Then the animals raise their
heads, and lift and push the timber aboard. They
are controlled chiefly by voice, aided by a goad.
“Tasman”: How many ways are there
of hanging gates in the bush ? I’ve them
swinging on factory-made hinges (rare) ; on iron
loops made of old bullock bows, the bow being
narrowed and the shafts driven through auger-holes
(fairly common) ; on an iron loop at top, with the
bottom revolving in a hole in a piece of wood
sunken until the top was three or four inches above
tire ground; on loops made of hoop-iron and of
leather (both used for light gates only). Another
gate is made with the upright prolonged both ways.
The top is rounded and fits into an auger-hole in a
piece of slab nailed across the top of the post,
while the bottom is likewise rounded and turns in
a socket made either of wood, as described above, or
the bottom of a beer bottle. These are the main
divisions, but there are minor varieties. With the
factory-made hinges, f’rinstance, Wirewhiskers can
use either the one-piece kind or the sort that goes
in two chunks, the head of the shaft fitting on a_
spike driven in the post. With the latter variety
there’s nothing-ho stop the first rag-time bull that
comes along from lifting the gate off its hinge’s.
The one-piece kind make better hinges, but they
have their drawbacks. The wandering he-cow can
still heave the contraption skyward and prance on to
the harem, leaving ruin in his tracks.
“Nymboi”: Some months ago, on the Bar-
rington River, a tributary of the Manning (N.S.AV.),
a draft of fat bullocks was being yarded to be
trucked to Sydney. One was missed, and search
failed to locate him. Three weeks afterwards two
Wingham men came across an old powder magazine,
which had been used during the construction of the
North Coast railway line. Out of curiosity they
looked inside, and there was his nibs, fast in a trap
of his own making. Except for loss of condition
he was none the worse.

BILLY BLUEGUM : “Mathieson’s dorg is a mong.”
THE NEW T EACHER: “Well, finish the sentence, Billy. Among what?”
BILLY (bright boy): “Among good dorgs, Miss.”
“Pick”: Is there any portion of Aus-
tralia’s crust inaccessible to the bullock puncher?
The deep, valleys of the Shoalhaven (N.S.W.) are
scored with his zigzag trails, and once the Lett
brothers, of Kiandra, crossed with their bullock
waggons even Lobb’s Hole, where the parrots open
their umbrellas before attempting to float down the
hillsides. The Letts were delivering timber from a
Bago country sawmill to the. Yarrangobilly River
bridge. They drew the lumber to the rim of the
tableland, and without unhitching the teams paid
out the unloaded waggons at the ends of wire ropes
with turns round convenient trees. It was a 1500 ft.
drop in three-quarters of a mile. Then they released
the timber, reloaded it at the bottom, and scrambled
on up the cliffs to the other side of the chasm. The
brothers saved 50 miles by making this hazardous
short cut, but the worries and broken gear decided
them that the longest way back was the sweetest way
home.

“T. McM.”: Just two months before the
war a German arrived at Thursday Island, char-
tered a launch and set off on a “special mission”
through the islands of Torres Strait, the which
islands are famous throughout the
world for the variety and uncommon-
ness of their orchids. At Badu, one
of the biggest dots, Dogsausage en-
gaged the whole village, men, women
and children, to search for the plants,
and in a few weeks the island was
denuded of them as if the forests had
been swept by a plague. When the
vandalism was complete, Dogsausage
objected to pay the natives their
rightful wages as required by the
law of Queensland, and he resorted
to all sorts of Hunnish tricks until
the Department came down with a
heavy hand, and he had reluctantly
to square up. BufP on doing so he
remarked: “Well, you won’t find
many orchids on . Vour islands after
I am gone.” He spoke the truth—•
for a change. Orchids are now so
scarce that a search would not bring
in one a week. The others were
taken to Berlin and sold at fancy
prices. >
“Reka”: Maoriland orchardists, farmers,
agricultural experts and acclimatisation enthusiasts
are considering- the opossum, and examining his
references. The orchardist complains that the ’poss
dines gloriously on apple-bloom and young fruit,
and the farmer declares he has met him under sus-
picious circumstances in his crops, but the acclima-
tisation enthusiast asserts that the value of the little
chap's skin transcends all other considerations. The
decision arrived at so far is that the recruit
shall be given an exemption provided he signs an
agreement to confine himself wholly to a bush diet.
Otherwise —Outski! The trouble with all the
immigrant pests in M.L. has been that they never
adhered to the purpose for which they were im-
ported, but allowed themselves to be led astray by
the variety of temptations awaiting them. Stoats,
ferrets and weasles, invited in to exterminate the
rabbits, early discovered that the native birds and
their eggs were easier victims, so that while bunny
frisked unmolested the bush birds rapidly neared
extinction.
“A.E.R.” : This is the communique as my
Tanna (New Hebrides) boy heard of it and the
report of our interview about it:—•
“Master, altogeder manbush he speak all asame.

WHEN TOMMY CAME MARCHING HOME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Devine came back the other day.
We’d planned a great home-cornin’.
No long trombone we had to play,
No fine, heroic drummin’.
With two sticks and a milk-can Borne
Put up a martial clatter,
While Carter blew a bullock-horn.
Says Tom Devine, with healthy scorn:
“Gorstruth! what is the matter ?”
We set three colored petticoats
From Baker’s chimneys blowin’
(’Tis not the bravest flag that floats,
Yet ’twas the finest goin’) ;
We cheered our hero all we knew,
No song of praise neglectin’,
To show our pride as he limped through.
He merely spat and snorted, “Who
“The ’ell are yous expectin’ ?”
They lured him to my shop somehow,
And sued for news of battle.
Says Tom: “Who rides the mail track now ?
Who’s herdin’ Stringer’s cattle?”
A dint the Turk put in his head
He covers with a ringlet.
He’d won a medal, so we read.
“I might ’ave ’ad it pinched,” he said—
“l’ve sewn it in my singlet!”
Says Cole: “But, ’strutli, you must ’ave seen
A fearful swag of scrapjMn’.”
And Tom agrees: “Where men are keen
That’s pretty sure to ’appen.

Got such a doin’ that at day, ' 1

"Xgatik”: Before the whalemeat-eating
controversy is forgotten, let me put in a word for
the sea-elephant. The flesh of this mammal, in
comparison with the whale’s, is as whiting to dugong.
An ox's tongue is not in it with that of my client,
and I never eat his liver without thinking of pork.
And that reminds me. Someone said weka was no
good to cat. He is a land agent. On the Mac-
quaries, where the bird was introduced many years
ago by one JGlder, it invariably forms the main
portion of the lonely sealers' Sunday dinner and is
considered a great delicacy. The oil skimmed from
the cooking pot is a sure cure for rheumatism. Ask
any of Maw-son’s men and see if they don’t praise
both elephant and weka as grub.
* * * *
“Barcoo” I don’t want to reopen the big-
tree argument, but I must put on record a giant red
gum that upended - itself in Gippsland (Vic.). Years
ago, when Cobb and Co. provided the only trans-
port between Gippsland and Melbourne, this big
fellow flourished not far from Bairnsdale. Portion
of the stump had been burnt right out, leaving the
still-alive tree supported by two fangs at opposite
sides. The driver of the mail coach had the ground
portion of the butt chipped down, and it was a
source of pride and pleasure to him to drive his six-
horse vehicle loaded with freight and passengers
straight through the cavity. Dinkum.
“Novus”: Ten or eleven years ago John
Ross delivered a 16-ton boiler at the Dempsey mine
(Vic.). On the journey from the Mansfield railway sta-
tion he had the collaboration of 4.3 horses. Mud, blas-
phemy and despair were always prominent. Abo.-
liars with any knowledge of the country between
Jamieson and Woods Point will understand the size
of the job. Of course, 43 horses were not used
throughout the journey. Once off the main road the
many sharp bends necessitated shortening the line.
For fully 30 miles of the picnic, however, the
procession was led by the full strength of the c-o.
“Splodger” : ll<nv do pa and ma pelican
construct their habitation and where? Some say ma
rends her raiment to build the nest, but probably
that's romance. Pelicans from my experience
patronise a tremendous area. 1 have been charmed
with them on all sides of this continent, except the
under side, as well as on the inland rivers. Once
while camped near Bourke (N.S.W.) awaiting the
liver pilot a commotion set me scurrying to the bank.
It was caused by a great mob of pelicans taking to
the water. The back-pedalling as they alighted
sounded for all the world like a Darling River Noah’s
Ark at full speed.

“Nick Bottom”: As a man who is person-
ally acquainted with the accused, let me tell “X.Y.”
(B. 10/8/’IG) that the kangaroo-rat won’t eat meat.
1 kept one as a pet for over three years and, though
often tempted, the little animal steadfastly refused
anything but a strictly vegetable diet. Again, the
rat doesn’t smell any worse than many other mar-
supials and not half as bad as the bandicoot. If
“X.Y.” had adhered strictly to the truth he would
have said that the coot is the stinker, and although
even the most self-respecting dog aches to kill him
on sight, the most depraved mongrel refuses to eat
him. This is not the case with the ’roo-rat, for I
have frequently given his remains to the dogs as a
tit-bit. Finally, I’ll bet “X.Y.” a brace of rums
that he can’t tell the difference between curried
’roo-rat and spring chicken.
THE BREED TEST.
BILL: “Why didn’t yer give a bloke t h’ offis
that there was bullets chasing us?"
JIM : "What yer fussing about! We’ve got
’em beat, ain’t we?"
THEOLOGICAL.
PARSON (ending exhortation): “And there
shall be nailing and gnashing of teeth."
IRRENVERENT ONE: “And woe unto them that
have no teeth, for they shall hare to
gnash their gums."
“The Reefer” : The discussion as to what
happens when a gun with a blocked barrel is fired
brings to my memory a Papuan native policeman
who got a cleaning-rag jambed in the barrel of his
.303 carbine. He brought the trouble to his Euro-
pean patrol officer and asked, “Which way you
think I gettim out this feller, taubada?” “What,
you crimson idiot! You no-savvy cleanem gun?”
snapped the boss. “Gimme one feller cartridge,
quick feller.” Click snapped the breech-lock. Bang
went the bomb. Wh-rrrr! Biff! ! It took me a
long while to convince those two that they weren't
dead. In fact, I’m not sure that the nigger is con-,
vinced yet.
“Frank S.”: When is someone going to
investigate the question of the drying-up of the rich
Western District of Victoria? This desiccation has
been going on now for half a century. In 1844
John Thompson, of Kielarnbete, camped on the bank
of Lake Terang. It was then a noble sheet of
water of a tout 700 acres, and
■ was actually running - over at one
corner. Thompson was the only-
white man to see it overflow.
Since then it has been drying-up
steadily, until last year it was as
parched as a wowser’s sideboard.
Lake Kielarnbete is also going-
dry ; but its extra deptli is
enabling it to last better. When l
was a boy, about 30 years ago,
Kielarnbete was much bigger. It
is now some 40ft. below the level
of those days. What is the explana-
tion? Surely a phenomenon of this importance is
worth some scientific study ?
* * * *
“Oueyn”: A sufferer from dengue fever
and lung troubles recently returned to the Victorian
Mallee for a spell. Living among the farmers he
says he finds great benefit from inhaling the smoke
of the pine. Canada advertises its pines deafeningly,
but there is no necessity for Australians to buy
steamer tickets. Any doubter may have the name
of the party benefiting.
“Aneb”: A lot of rabbits having en-
trenched themselves on a hillside, I was advised to
get to work with gas. So I invested in a drum of
carbon bisulphide, and now find all hands in dis-
agreement as to how it should be used. Some say
that it's only effective when the ground is wet, i.e.,
in winter, and others declare this to be bunkum.
Some “experts” maintain that the stuff ought to be
“fired” before the burrows are sealed, and they are
flatly contradicted by other argumentative persons.
Would someone who knows definitely state whether
the most effective method of use is as liquid fire or
gas, and if operations can be carried on irrespective
of the season ?
"Xgntik”: “Pick” (B. 10/S/’Hi) inquires
about the marine monster that preys upon the
penguin. During a jaunt to the Auckland Islands
1 observed a sea-leopard, commonly known as the
grey seal, dart upon an unsuspecting Victoria penguin
and swallow it. I have killed several of these
seals, and in each case found penguins' feathers
decorating the bingy. By the way, does anyone know
the breeding haunts of the sea-leopard? The beast's
alias at the Royal Society is Hvdrurga leptonyx,
and when it visits the Australian coasts it generally
mb Ices the voyage in pairs.
“The Hun”: If “Corundum” (B.
5/10/T6) will allow a house, to be a waggon within
the meaning of the Act this is my big team. When
Orme’s store was erected at Green’s Gunyah, before
the present town of Lockhart (N.S.W.) appeared on
the map, it was built on pine logs, so that it could
be pulled on to the site in the new town when the
surveyor had got through with his job. Corney
Bros., teamsters, hitched 48 horses on to the em-
porium when moving time came. The distance was
only about six furlongs, but it took two days to
do it.
“Barooo” : The kangaroo mouse, the comi-
cal little marsupial that is two or three times the
size of the ordinary mouse, makes a nest of very
fine grasses in secluded places well away from obser-
vation. Recently one was caught in its residence at
Billinbah, Narandera (N.S.W.). There was a cluster
of nine young ones adhering to the small mother
in the best “kangaroo-on-the-teat” manner. The
little lady’s pouch was too small to accommodate
the whole darned family, and some of them had
to be content with a head inside and the rest of
their bodies out in the cold.
‘Tiny”: When Fat Dick died the whole
camp went into mourning for a day and a night in
a tasteful garb of white kaolin. They were a - weird-
looking crowd, their hair plastered with as much of
the clay-as it would hold adding particularly to the
frightfulness. The boss ordered the body to be
buried a good distance from the homestead, and I
was told to bullock-dray Dick to his last home. He
was rolled in an old skin rug and then wound round
and round from head to feet with a thin rope
woven of hair from the mourners’ heads. The chief
Binghi walked ahead of the sad and variegated pro-
cession, prodding the ground occasionally with a yam
stick until he found a soft spot in which to dig the
bone-pit. This was made just deep enough to hold
the remains, which were then covered with earth. A
stick was placed upright at each corner of the grave
and brushwood was stacked on top to a height of
four feet. With that the ceremony ended. After
tile burial the name of the departed is never men-
tioned, Binghi believing that to do such a thing
would be very unlucky.

“Jans Tas." : Anybody ever heard of the
medicinal properties of the bracken fern? As
youngsters whenever we were stung b\- jackjumper
or bulldog ants we used to grub up a fern, get its
root, break it and apply it to the affected part. If
the juice was rubbed in well the pain would vanish.
“Waikonini” : Ilawkes Bay (M.L.) Philo-
sophical Society has been helping itself to some
recollections of the good old days. Amongst them
was the record of one F. .7. Tiffen, who in 1849
isolated himself with a flock of sheep in a corner of
Godforgotten. For three years he lived there prac-
tically alone. A while after he had the monotony
broken for him by being called to Wellington to
give evidence in a murder trial. Carrying his swag
he sauntered 340 miles. He said it was a welcome
eh a nge.

BILL THE RINGER: “Reminds a feller of old

“The Ratcatcher’s Daughter” : I thought
there were some big eels in the lagoon at Napier
(M.L.), and once 1 fancied I saw the taniwlia.
which is the father of all cels and wears ears. But
Prospect Reservoir, which holds up Sydney’s water
supply, had a surprise for me. ’The other night, a
flood night, great numbers of eels passed over the
by-wash of the dam. We got some on the flats that
measured 4ft. 6in. from rudder to whiskers and were
as thick as a J. C'. Williamson chorus matron's leg.
A WATERSCAPE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tlio “crick” was “up” at Dungaree.
The dreary yellow waters spread
As far as human ‘eye could see,
Encumbered with the drowned and dead ;
And robbed of every horn and hoof,
Cobb perched upon his stable roof.
Came Tonkin drifting on a door,
A fragment of the local church.
Lugubrious and damp and sore
lie joined his neighbor on the perch,
lie said: “You haven't seen to-day
My missus pass along this way?”
Cobb dumbly shook his dripping head.
And Tonkin breathed an oath. “I hoped
They’d foundered somewhere here,” he said,
“For she and Ryley have eloped.
I wouldn't care a single darn,
But, ’struth, the beggars took the barn !"

“These are Heavyweight Australian
_ ‘Dunlops’— not Equipment Tyres!**
When Buying a New Car—Order
A ustralian = made “ Dunlovs ! ”
Why?
Read one of the
Reasons—it Wilt
interest intend =
ing purchasers
of Cars.
EQUIPMENT TYRES.
This conveys little to the ordinary Car buyer, but to the
man who knows it means a lot. It means the difference
between low priced light-weight tyres-—and heavy-weight
covers requisite for satisfactory tyre service on our roads.
To keep the selling price of Cars down the light cover is
invariably fitted, and the unenlightened Car buyer-
knowing no better—accepts the light equipment tyres.
Here’s an instance—one Car sold in this Country comes
out equipped with 815 x 105 m/m tyres. The Agent wrote
the maker asking if he could have Cars minus tyres, so
that he could use Australian goods “Yes”—was the reply
—“we will allow a rebate of 53 Dollars (£ll 1/-) per set.”
Similar tyres are sold out here for £44 6/- per set. The
“Dunlop” price for heavier and better tyres is £3B 11/-
A comparison of the weight of these imported tyres with
DUNLOP TYRES
(Australian-made) is instructive and points a moral:—
Dunlop—4 Covers 82 lbs., 4 Tubes 16 lbs. —98 lbs.
Imported—4 Covers 671b5., 4 Tubes 10 lbs. — 77lbs.
A difference of 21 lbs. weight in material, to say nothing
of the higher grade rubber we use. This extra weight of
the best quality rubber and fabric means thousands of
miles more service than you can expect or get from the
light-weight tyre equipment on most imported Cars. Do
you want this class of tyre—and the troubles incidental
to light covers and tubes ? You probably don’t. You can
avoid light tyres by ordering “Dunlops”—heavy high-
grade tyres suitable for Australian road conditions.

“Bad Australian”,: I have just come off a
500-kilo, ride through Paraguay, and during
that barbaric excursion I saw more oranges
than I supposed this world to contain—
sweet, sour and bitter oranges,'cultivated in
gardens and paddocks, and train-loads hurry-
ing south to Buenos Aires for distribution
throughout the Argentine; and all of them
as nothing compared with those which grow
wild. The vast Paraguayan rnontes, very
similar to N. S. Wales North Coast or
Queensland scrubs, are profuse with the
trees. Between Tacuati and San Pedro, on
the River Ypane, the track runs through a
monte which for five leagues is practically a
wild-orange grove. Hundreds of thousands
of tons of the produce rot annually in the
Paraguayan mantes, and although sugar
grows practically without cultivation, no-
body seems to be making any attempt to
establish what might be the biggest mar-
malade and fruit-extract factory on the
planet. Men are scarce and excessively
tired in Paraguay, and the women (who
are in a great majority) attend to the
banana and mandioca patch, and the roach-
backed hog, and the never-empty cradle,
while the boss lounges in the shade, _ smoking
his native cigar and imbibing cana, while
he strums an old guitar or pumps a wheezy
accordion.

“Gliolmondley Fitzmaggot” writes from
Salisbury Plain (in the Gold Country) :
A digression from war, to talk for a minute on
margarine. One seldom sees butter here; it has
become too expensive as an article of common diet.
So the much-maligned margarine, or butter sub-
stitute, takes its place in the messes of both officeis
and men. Its enforced use is steadily undermining
the rather unreasonable prejudice that has for long
existed in the heads of many Australians against
this synthetic cow-grease. It is wholesome and
palatable, and many a good cow-cocky soldier has
eaten pounds of it before he realised the fact that
it was not the true product of child-slavery. There
is, and rightly too, a healthy commercial repug-
nance t 6 the practice of retailing margarine as
butter, and it should continue to exist; but mar-
garine, as margarine, is another proposition. One
of the minor results of the war will be the breaking
down of popular prejudice against butter substitute.
The dairy-farmers of Bacchus Marsh, the Northern
Rivers and the Darling Downs will mumble curses
into their nicotine-smeared beards, but, on the other
hand, it may bring the kid of the cow country
back into some of his own. Genuine butter, as an
article of diet for the soldier, has ceased to be; it
is as dead as the voice of Reason at a Union meeting
discussing conscription.

“Dead Finish” : Any bad Australian who
wants to balance the Chow when he comes
around the farm buying “fat” has my per-
mission to use this recipe. Mix a couple of
packets of cornflour in about half a kero-
sent tin of water. Then render down half
a kerosene tin of fat and infuse one into
the other. When this sets I’ll wager the
Dingbat won’t be able to detect it from
clean fat. It is miles ahead of the better-
known gidya ashes recipe. I’ve tried both.
“Cam”: A Melbourne firm is showing a
hitherto incredulous Australia that even if
the foreigner was wiped off the list we
would still be able to get a clock. Woods
used in casing the locally manufactured
article include fiddleback, blackwood, Queens-
land maple, silky oak, rosewood, walnut and
Tasmanian hardwood. The last, I think,
looks the best of the lot, the grain showing
up splendidly when polished.
* * * *
“F.H.”: It’s against the law in Victoria
to take money for telling a fellow-citizen
what the future holds for him, unless the
telling is done by a doctor or a clergyman.
But one fortune-teller’s loss is another’s
gain, for the Ass in Victoria doesn t prevent
the Maoriland prophet from seeking in Vic-
toria the spoil which the local soothsayer
is forbidden to touch. He does it by ads.
in the newspapers, and Webster,
obligingly forwards the money and no ques-
tions asked.
* * *
“F.N.T.”: An interesting item at the
A.N.A. exhibition, to be held in Melbourne
next January, will be an aeroplane-body
made entirely of Australian timbers. Avia-
tor Basil Watson, lately back in Victoria
from England, is to show it. It will hardly
be the first all-Australian-timber machine,
however; and many tractor-blades, which
are built in several pieces and are the most
important piece of timber in an aeroplane’s
works, have been made from Australian
stuff. The Defence Department’s machines
are thus furnished —those made in Austra-
lia, that is ; and some of these blades look
handsome enough to hang over the fireplace
in the library.
* * * *
“R.A.Y.”: It’s a pity for all concerned
that the farm machinery salesman in Aus-
tralia doesn’t know his job better. Some
manufacturers are year by year turning out
improved implements to meet local condi-
tions, but their enterprise fails to return the
best results because of the incompetents who
trade for them. These agents as a rule
know nothing either of the mechanism of
the implement they sell or of the conditions
in which it is expected to work. Their main
qualifications for their job is a mendacious
loquacity, with the result that costly new
implements are to be seen cast aside on
many farms, while the neighbors, alarmed
by these failures, fight shy of the risk and
plod along with old and inefficient types of
farming aids. Manufacturers ought to know
their business best, so I presume that any
increase in it would give them a headache.
* • * * *
The incensed cocky put it this way to the
firm: —•
Dere Sur, —Yure blasted seprater has gone bung

“Fax”: A Melbourne pub. whose title
bears evidence of old age is the Sarah Sands;
and not many people seem to know how the
old Sydney-road landmark got its name. The
Sarah Sands was a troopship which caught
fire on a voyage to India in the autumn of
1858. While the vessel was burning the
women and children, wives and families of
the soldiers, were lowered into the boats,
the men staying aboard to fight the flames
and work the pumps. Eventually the fire
was got under and the leak, which had let
in 15ft. of water, was stopped. Women and
children then returned to the devastated
Sarah Sands, and 10 days later she landed
the whole of her human freight at Mauritius.
The story of this remarkable achievement of
seamanship and discipline was reprinted in
one of Thackeray’s “Roundabout Papers” in
the first volume of the Cornhill Magazine
(1860).

“Exile”: The cafeteria eating-house is to
be found everywhere in Kingomalleyland.
It is usually a spacious, well-lighted cafe,
very clean and very plain. The visitor goes
along a railed passage, at the end of which
are benches holding hundreds of plates and
dishes containing butter, bread, fruit, stewed
fruit, pickles, preserves, etc. Alongside is a
pile of trays, also a pile of serviettes, each
rolled round two knives, two spoons and a
fork. You grab a tray and serviette and
help yourself from the row of dishes. If
you want any of six kinds of mush a waitress
serves you, or she will carve for you cold
or hot meat or help you to a portion of fish,
or stew, or pudding. You take small pots
of milk or cream and the usual glass of iced
“watter,” without which no self-respecting
Yankee ever eats a meal. Next you reach a
bench where you can get tea, coffee or cocoa
made freshly for you. If you want a boiled
or scrambled or fried egg, or fancy a buck-
wheat cake or a griddle cake or a waffle, you
order it from the waitress and can stand
and see it cooked if you like. You stagger
with your tray to a cash desk; there the
waiter glances over your load of food, adds
the cost mentally and hands you a cash-
register ticket for the amount. You then
go through the brass railing to any table
you choose in the room, and there you find
condiments and sugar. You can take all
the time you please to finish your meal, and
can leave the cafe only by passing a cashier.
The meals are remarkably cheap, well
cooked and good, and you simply wait on
yourself. I’ve had a full breakfast for
and a good luncheon for Is. lAd.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Said a certain man to me
(Round about us golden weather,
Azure sky and shining sea)
As we drank good wine together,
Tended by a smiling girl:
“Once I had a priceless pearl.
“Having then a plaguey dearth
Of loud talk and boastful phrases,
Though I knew its wondrous worth,
Little did I sing its praises,
Thinking that its lustres choice
Spoke more loud than any voice.
“Up and down the town I went
Waiting (’tis a madcap story)
Till it should make evident
Its rare value and its glory ;
But, by all the stars that throng
In the heavens, I waited long!
“Girl, another round of wine!
As about the world I drifted
(Talk of pearls, and talk of swine!)
Scarce a single snout was lifted
From the trough to greet the light
Of that gem so pure, so white!
“Then I lost it. How or when
Little matters. Waking, sleeping,
Mistress Fortune’s gifts to men
Take a wondrous lot of keeping;
Though we hold them close and fast,
We may lose them at the last.
“Now this paltry thing I wear,
Praising it with ceaseless crying;
And the people throng and stare,
Thinking it a pearl outvying
Sheba’s gems or those that shone
On the breast of Solomon.’’
This the tale he told to me
As we sat at wine together;
At our feet the azure sea
Shining in the golden weather,
And a laughing girl anigh—•
Red of cheek and blue of eye.

BREAKING IT GENTLY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I say, dear boy,” he whispered me,
“You couldn’t let me have a quid?”
I'm “weaker” far than picnic tea ;
I really couldn’t, but I did.
He came on later. “Say, old man,
You couldn’t lend me thirty bob?”
I couldn't, and I never can,
And yet submitted like a yob,
And let the wretch my family rob.
On Wednesday said he: “I suppose
You haven’t got three quid to spare?”
By Friday his exactions rose—
He wanted five. In grim despair
I parted up. What good is thrift
When all one’s pinching, ’twould appear,
But spurs the prodigals to sift
Cash from our clothes, and to adhere
With greedy teeth to either ear?
When Monday came he said: “Old man,
I’m badly off for fifteen pounds.
1 know you’ll lend it if you can.”
I yelled with rage. ’Twas past all bounds.
“One, three, five, fifteen quid. Avaunt!”
He answered with angelic cheek:
“It is the fifteen that I want.
I meant the smaller sums last week
To break it gently, so to speak !”

SPORTING NOTIONS.
“Bad Australian”: Engineer Edwar
Bradley and Captain Angel M. Zuioaga crossed t
most elevated part of the Andes m the balloon
Eduardo Newberry on Saturday, June 24, 191 °’
this Republic of Argentina is howling itself hoarse
over the event. Thc-press acclaimed the voyagers
‘Argentina’s noble sons,” comparing their exploit
with the deeds of Hannibal, Napoleon and the
South American Liberator San Martin, ail of whom
have some reputation for big deeds in lofty Pj ac ® s -
There is no doubt that the first crossing of the
Andes even in a balloon is a very respectable
achievement, and it was only after several
that the feat was accomplished. The Eduardo New-
berry left Santiago de Chile at 8.30 a.m. on Ju e
24, and reached Uspallata, on the Transandine rai
way, Argentine side, 31 hours later. The journey
and landing were -accomplished under ideal condi-
tions. The greatest height reached was 8100 meters
(26,570 ft. approx.) and the lowest temperature
recored 32deg. below zero. The Camara de Deputados
patted the aeronauts on the back and voted each
a gold medal at the expense of the nation. Owing
to repeated failures, and what looks like jealousy
on the part of one or more responsible members or
the Aero Club Argentino, Bradley and Zuioaga were
instructed by the club to abandon their projected
voyage. Either these instructions did not rea.cn
them in time or they were wilfully disobeyed. The
result has been a somewhat discreditable row, end-
ing in the resignation of Bradley and Zuioaga, but
the matter will probably end in a crawl-down on
the part of the club. Bradley is the star air-spoit.
After the death of Edward Newberry through a fail
in Mendoza and the miraculous escape of Macias
when attempting the Transandine flight from Uspal-
lata, he came to the conclusion that the aeroplane
flight was impracticable and got busy on the balloon
idea, with the aid of Zuioaga. The result justified
their faith and labor. But there is a vast differ-
ence between drifting in a balloon and piloting a
’plane across the Andes with temperatures at 3-deg.
below. #
“Adelaide” : Perhaps the oddest thing about
Jack Booth’s new motor-cycle world’s record is the
place where it was made. In the cycling era, and
up to the early days of motor-cars, it was a common-
place of advice to keep off the Adelaide-to-Gawler
road. It is level enough ; but it was vilely kept and
in (say) 1900 to have come over from Vic. to put
up a speed record on it would have been simply
humorous. And now it holds a world’s record. Syd-
ney people needn’t despair of their Parramatta-road,
after all.
* * * *
Back in the long ago, when country clubs
built their own bats, Bungonia and Windellama, the
oldest settlements in Argyle (N.S.W.), had a match.
The Bungonias undertook to provide the bats, but
after travelling 12 miles to the playing ground
remembered they had left the tools at home. So the
match was started with pick-handles, Carter and
Morgan, of the Windellamas, taking strike, while a
horse decorated with a man raced back to Bungonia
for the willow. When the animal returned after
its 24 miles’ flutter Carter and Morgan were still
belting the cover off the ball with the remaining
splinters of their pick-handles, and the enemy was
carrying water in relays to the bowlers.
“X.Y.”: While the burning of motor-
cars can, in many instances, be traced to the care-
less use of naked lights, in many other cases the
origin of the flare-up remains a mystery. Once a
fire has started there is no doubt that its almost
instant spread over the whole of the car is assisted
by the dangerous character of the dressing applied to
the leather, or leather-cloth, of the trimmings. This,
generally, is nothing less than guncotton dissolved in
acetone.' In U.S.A., where cars are most numerous,
the mysterious outbreaks have led to careful investi-
gation, and the bulk of the evidence suggests that
they are caused by electric sparks emanating, not
from the electrical outfit of the car, but from the
person who fills, or the appliance used in filling, the
petrol-tank. One widely-accepted theory is that the
chamois skin placed in the funnel in order to strain
the petrol becomes highly charged with electricity
owing to the friction of the pet-rol passing through it.
Recently, a number of scientists investigated the
matter, and the electric origin of the fires was pretty
clearly established; but the experts exonerated the
chamois leather except in so far as it shares the
electrical state of the person filling the tank, in
dry, frosty weather (when most of these fires occur)
it is very easy for a man to become highly electri-
fied. Skating'about on the floor of the garage, which
is usually of insulating material, or an active pro-
cess of dusting the car, especially with chamois skin,
or a silk, or feather-duster, may electrify the car,
which is usually insulated from the earth by its
rubber tyres. Under favorable atmospheric condi-
tions it has been proved that electric sparks of
sufficient power to fire petrol vapor may easily be
produced. This matter is not of great moment to the
owners of cars in the coastal districts of Australia,
but it deserves the serious attention of those who
use them in the Western country. In dry weather
the electrical activity observable in Western Queens
land startles new-comers. Most people sleep
summer, using a stretcher which is placed inside
the house in the day, and often, when an attemp
is made to move the bed into the open, the operator
receives a shock which surprises him. If he attempts
to strip the bed he will see at the removal of each
blanket or rug a display of sparks and hear a loud
crackling. During the recent dry spell in Queens-
land two motorists were making towards Charleville
when they were overtaken by a “Thargommdah
shower” or duststorm. One of the men got out o
the car and placed his hand on the hood As ne
did so he received a shock which almost knoeke
him down. On attempting to crank the car both
men received shocks, but managed to start tne
?ng"ne By this time they had become .cautious
Some thick'rubber sheeting was used as an insulation
from the ground while the travellers stepped aboard.
Bv the time they arrived at Charleville the condi-
tion of the car was # #

How is it that the motor-car racing busi-
ness has not taken root in Australia? Something
queer about this, because there s a _ thrill in tne
thing right enough. For instance, during a whirl in
Michigan (U.S.A.) the other day the leading car,
driven by one Peacock, slewed in front of the others
—l3 of them. Result: Dead 3, wounded 7 ; 1
in a heap of wreckage. Seems as exciting as skittles,
anyhow.

For many weeks he piped the la}.
“There is the bird securely dead •
He’s bound to show them all the way.
He quite convinced me ’twas a sin
To fail to back the Prince to win.
I saw him from the races come.
He had that sort of flabby air ;
His nose was red, his face was glum,
A sigh bespoke extreme despair.
He asked me would I stand a dram,
Likewise a ticket for the tram.
“Lost everything!” he groaned. “I’m dry.
For every bean they’ve done me in.
“What of the Little Prince?” said I.
“Of course you know he had to win.

POLITICAL
POINTS
FOR THE SUPREME EMERGENCY.
O FFICER: “ You’re always obtaining leave.
Deaths in the family appear very fre-
quent. Are there any of you left?”
PRIVATE: “Only a sister, and I’m keeping
HER for the Cup.”
Party politics—the survival of the slickest.
The plain fact is that conscription didn't
get a fair deal. It was represented as a
thing detestable in principle and only to be
put up with because of a grave emergency.
From the first day of the war The Bulletin
called for it. Ministers turned it down—
there was no need for it yet. Pearce, like
most of the rest of them, threw discredit
upon it, failing or wilfully refusing to see
the justice of it. The Censorship was most
improperly used to suppress arguments in
favor of it. And when the people were asked
to approve of it, it was put to them as an
undesirable thing which they were asked to
stomach for the duration of the war only.
If, from the outset, conscription—or univer-
sal service, if you like —had been represented
as the just thing and the only orderly thing,
it would not have encountered one-tenth of
the opposition.
Oh, yes, we took this Referendum vote
seriously enough. At Prahran (Vic.) a man
made anxious inquiries at the electoral office
a week before the 28th. He wanted to know
hew an elector who expected to be away
from home on the 28th could record his vote.
The conditions were explained to him.
“Leaving the State?” he was asked. “Oh.
no,” he said, “I’m not goin’ out of Victoria.”
“Going to a provincial town—Ballarat or
Bendigo?” “No. The fact of the matter is,
boss, I’m expectin’ to be in gaol on Satur-
day.”
When the conscriptionist considers the
result of the Referendum in some divisions
of N. S. Wales and S. Australia in parti-
cular, it may do him good to remember that
Pontius Pilate also appealed to the people
and they said “Give us Barabbas!”
On the majority judgment of the High
Court in the Bananaland stock case, upend-
ing the last hope that inter-State trade might
be free from the calamitous State inter-
ferences of the past:—
Justice Barton: The decision of the majority of
this Court will have a grievous effect upon the
future of the Commonwealth, as it will tend to
keep up the separation of its people upon State lines
by imputing to the Constitution a meaning which, I
venture to say, was never dreamed of by its framers,
and a meaning which will probably result in the
very dangers and dislocations which its provisions
were intended, and, in my judgment, were aptly
framed, to prevent. I end my judgment by express-
ing heavy sorrow that their Honors’ decision is as
it is.
Justice Isaacs: Though Australians hitherto thought
their Constitution had placed inter-State trade on a
basis broader than in Canada, and more inviolable
than in America, a belief to some extent, at all
events, shared by the High Court in prior cases, and
even by the Privy Council itself, it now appears
that not only was this a wide-spread error, but that
inter-State trade can exist only as far as the several
States will allow it. I cannot add the traditional
judicial regret at inability to concur in this
decision.
Both these Judges, who were leaders of the
Federal Convention and knew what the
framers of the Constitution intended, virtu-
ally say that this judgment makes the Fede-
ration a jest. Whatever their law may be,
their conclusion on that point is unclialleng-
able. The Constitution could not be kept
out of the melting pot now by a herd of
elephants.
The Gov. of Vic. and his Ex. of South Aus-
tralia and the Cocked Hat of Tasmania were
taken down the Murray the
other day to see for themselves
how Australia lets its water run
to waste. All three were attended
by genthelps, who stood back
respectfully. But when there
wasn’t a Governor immediately
in front they also could see how
the water was running to waste.
The captain of the steamer had
seen it running for years, and
the bloke who peeled the pota-
toes was sick of the sight of it.
The hovering reporters tele-
graphed back to their papers
that the potentates were “deeply
impressed.” The genthelps were
less deeply impressed—-not
through callousness, but simply
because it isn’t etiquette for a
genthelp to be as deeply im-
pressed as his Excellency. And
the water is still running to
waste, and the bloke on the river
steamer is still peeling potatoes
and keeping up his attitude of
splendid indifference. If his
surname isn’t Australia it ought
to be.
A silver lining to every cloud !
Even the chairman of Melbourne
Stock Exchange, addressing his
gloomy co-brokers on the ques-
tion of double taxation and the
need for national economy, finds
something to be thankful for —
that “there isn’t a third Govern-
ment to take what the other two
have left.”
Anyhow, the German has no right to
chortle over the result of our Referendum
until he has shown that he is game to have
a Referendum too. If there were no Neins
in his neighborhood he wouldn’t have to
chain his men to their machine-guns.
Just before he threw up his job ex-
Treasurer Higgs suggested that a “study” of
his last statements of accounts blew out the
charges of extravagance. Well, have a look
at these expenditure figures and see how
economy is being practised by one Govern-
ment in seven: —-
Cost of Pre-war year. This year.
Parliament .. . . 1136,703 £43,605
Advances to States . . —• 4,550,000
Post Office . . . . 4,775,158 5,105,871
Home Affairs . . . . 458,611 1,129,818
External Affairs . . 637,610 717,813
The expenditure apart from war in 1913-14
was £23,160,733; this year it is £32,585,791.
Apparently the reason why “peace” expendi-
ture was boomed is that war expenditure in
1913-14 was od., while the 1916-17 estimate
(indefinite) is £85,299,500, and that the in-
terest bill has increased from £99,910 to
£8,162.000. These figures show how absurd
it is to even mention the need of preventing-
waste.
The shameful No was flashed across the sea ;
Then from the Kaiser cries of joy arose:
“Gott bless the friends who worked so hard for me!
At last I have Australia by the Noes.’’
One of the great advantages of buying
from the foreigner, whom you can’t send
your Board of v Health to inspect, is that you
often get more than you pay for. This, for
instance, is from the annual report of the
Local Government Board for Scotland, 1915 :
In August we were informed by the medical
officer of the English Local Government Board that
two cases of anthrax occurring in civilians had re-
cently been traced to infection from shaving-brushes.
At a later date one of these brushes was found to be
still infected with anthrax spores. The other brush
was derived from the same source. Some of the
material from which the brushes were manufactured
had also been examined and anthrax spores detected
in it. It was ascertained that the mixed hair (horse-
hair plus goat hair, etc.) used in the manufacture
of these brushes was derived from China.
The inherent tendency of
certain persons to do what
they know they shouldn’t is
the reason they have to pay
many bills they rather
wouldn’t. Thus Premier
Peacock is just now imposing-
additional taxation, and here
is one of the causes. The State
now owns 70 rabbit inspec-
tors, 45 inspectors of dairies,
28 of fruit, 18 of spud, 38 of
factories, 10 of mines, 25 of
public works, and 42 of edu-
cation, besides 24 Crown lands
bailiffs (inspectors of timber-
getters, etc.) —300 in all.
There are also two “super-
visors,” who inspect these in-
spectors. That is all; but in
the interests of economy and
national efficiency someone
should certainly be appointed to oversee
those two supervisors.
In consequence of the money it has made
out of the war the U.S.A. expects that
N’York will become the world’s financial
centre. The Great Parveneutral.
Federal Food Prices Commissioner Acker-
man got some interesting evidence in Sydney
lately. A miller’s representative said that a
certain locally-made rolled oats was admit-
tedly superior to an imported American
brand, yet the price, of the superior Aus-
tralian article was fixed below what the
inferior foreign goods sold for in Queens-
land. That, the witness argued, was detri-
mental to the local product. And perhaps
he was right. The Stinking Fish party has
dinned into the ear of Australia that the
foreigner can always do the thing better;
so now, when a Board fixes the price of an
Australian article at less than a foreign
competitor sells his goods for, the unpatri-
otic Australian is liable to assume that it is
simply because the foreign article is better.
It is another hole that price-fixing falls
into. Price-fixing makes a hobby of falling
into holes.
The good example set by Australia in pro-
tecting from misuse the word Anzac is being
followed by Great Britain. A Bill was passed
into the House of Commons last week
which will prevent the managers of mushy
tea-shops, or any other business fraud, thing
or place trading on the name.

THE USUAL REMEDY.
PRIVATE : “ Sergeant , this bloomin’ machine’s
gone crook on us. What are we going
to do?”
SERGEANT (late shearer): “Well, you’ll have
ter cut in with the blades, that’s all.”
Before the vote was taken on the conscrip-
tion issue Billson, leader of the Noes in the
Vic. Assembly, hinted that after the poll.the
bonds might lie re-tied between the Mate
Labor party and the three Labontes who
have been discarded for advocating l es
William Plain (Geelong), James McLach-
lan (Gippsland North) and John Chatham
(Grenville). But the three outstanders have
other views at present. Probably a room
CONSTANT GADDERS.
FIRST CLUBMAN ( throwing down the paper):
“Well, I’m as patriotic as the next man,
but I’ll he sorry when all the German
submarines are cleared off. They’re the
only things that ever Kept my family
from going Glome ’ every year.”
will be secured at Parliament House, and ex-
Minister David Smith, who was also pushed
out on a matter of principle, will be invited
to join his late Cabinet cobber, Plain, and
the others. So, it is hoped, the nucleus of
die-hards may ultimately find an opportunity
to be of some service to the State. Their
stand on the conscription issue is a good
start, anyway.
Recently, according to George Moir, a well-
known Melbourne lawyer, a firm in Western
America offered .to supply Australia with
100,000 ft. of hardwood grown from Austra-
lian seeds. (Laughter.) The joke is a good
stable-companion for that now elderly item
relating to South African wattle-bark. We
import it in large quantities for tanning; and
it, too, is taken from trees grown there from
Australian seeds. (Renewed mirth.) Still,
amusing though they may be, these tales
would be much funnier if they weren’t true.
Albert Mullett, Government printer at
Melbourne, a strong barracker for the local
manufacture of paper, doesn’t confine his
research enthusiasm to the one line. There’s
Australian clay, too, “the finest clay in the
world.” It seems quite likely that Mullett is
right about the quality of the clay; but the
outlook for the clay-baker has a mottled
appearance, nevertheless. Some time ago a
Melbourne citizen bought one million teacups
from Japan, in one order, and now he is
realising a mighty profit on the deal, after
paying all charges. So long as this sort of
thing can go on, with apparent satisfaction
to all parties, it looks as though the best
clay in the world is going to stay in the
bank—a fixed deposit drawing no interest.
Every little local squabble and dispute in
wartime intensifies the national danger and
should be penalised accordingly. A young
Bananalander who passed through Sydney
the other day on his way south to volunteer
said lie didn’t realise until he got into Bris-
bane how serious the war situation was, all
the Outback papers he had seen being far
more interested in local shearers’ strikes and
nursery rows of that sort.
King O'Malley lately told a deputation,
Avhich buttonholed him on the subject, that
he would consult the general-manager in

A PLEA FOR SILENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tradition holds with an unholy grip.
Through weary phrases politicians waddle.
They lift the sluice and let the large floods rip
Of their incessant and insistent twaddle.
Never a new-cut word of force or strength
Lights the dull course of what they call debating.
The old thin thoughts to their elastic length
Are duly stretched while work is still kept waiting.
It does no good, this mouthing idle things—-
No sort of good is aimed at or pretended.
As vain as that slight song the blowfly sings
Is the long buzz of M’s.L.A. upended.
It never makes impression on a vote ;
No rhetoric can carry a conviction ;
Yet every statesman like a William goat
Bleats hoarsely on in praise or contradiction.
Speech had its place what time with lips of fire
Old Freedom’s champions set keen councils rock-
ing;
But now the Caucus simply pulls the wire,
For all the points of State are interlocking.
Let us have silence. If, like Turks and Kurds,
Our politicians must have room for fighting,
Set a cold limit of a hundred words
And make the user put them down in writing.
This would save pain and paper and much print,
And ease the jaws and elevate the nation.
Hansard would wane; but there would be no stint
Of time for silent, solid legislation.

By The Bulletin man who watches
them in Sydney :
Not many horses are deemed to have a chance tor
the Melbourne Cup because Ike has .put Shepherd King',
the Caulfield .Cup winner, on such a mark that the
public is afraid to invest. This imported nag must
have a great say in the race, but there is another
from the same stable, Aides, also from the Cold
Country, that is touted as something out of the
ordinary. Charles Wheeler trains the pair, and has
form to guide him, for he turned out last year’s
victor, Patrobas. Aides led into the straight in
the Caulfield Cup, and was going so well that some
people took their boots off in a rush to get 6 to 4
about the stranger winning. Aides will be a better
horse on Tuesday. Maoriland has a couple in the
event with claims, and the writer has heard one
hard-head declare that Kilboy could fall 'down and
then win. Sasanof has been going great guns on the
track. The Sydney-owned Lingle, favorite for so
long time until lately, has done nothing to make
the people behind him feel sorry for themselves.
Lingle has gone through a great preparation, and
will start backed for a ton by his big-punter pro-
prietor. Shepherd King, Lingle and Aides or Kilboy
look like being well in the picture 100 yards from
the finish. Which is the best 'of the quartette this
writer will be able to explain after the dispute is
over. . '«
* * * #
From this paper’s old-established Mel-
bourne prophet:— '
Only once in the past 13 years has the
winner of the Melbourne Cup carried more than Bst.,
although the runner-up in six instances has humped
anything from Bst. 51b. to lOstj This year there
appear to be only five possible winners in the under-
-Bst. lot, viz., Lingle, Kilboy, Stag-eland, Sasanof and
Eastcourt. The question between Kilboy, Stageland
and Eastcourt will not necessarily be settled by their
V.R.C. Derby running on Saturday, but the winner
of the classic race is pretty certain to start first
favorite for the Cup, on the strength of what
Patrobas did last year: Should Kilboy win easily a
lot of people will think the Cup all over bar the
shouting; nevertheless the writer will continue to
think that all the three-year-olds are a moderate lot
until their excellence is proved. If anything beats
Kilboy in the Derby it will possibly be Stageland, who
is said to be a good stayer, although his form in
public has given no hint of his alleged stamina.
The son of Comedy King won a nine-furlongs race at
Randwitk after being decisively beaten in the A..T.C.
Derby. But he may have been short of condition
in those days.
Last year the first two horses in the Caulfield Cup
were warm favorites for the longer race at Fleming-
ton, and neither of them had the least bit of a say
in the finish. All the same, it seems safe to count
on the probability of Shepherd King, Arnata and
Sasanof —the first three horses at Caulfield —being
prominent figures in the final stages of Melbourne
Cup struggle. Shepherd King is one of the finest
imported nags we have seen, and he looks good for
two miles. Nobody knows but what Amata may
be as fond of a distance as the other offspring of
Wallace that have won the Melbourne Cup. There is
no visible reason whv the insignificant-looking mare
who beat Sasanof in the fastest Caulfield Cup on
record shouldn’t do it again next Tuesday. There
is more reason for thinking that Shepherd King’s
penalty will not stop him from beating them both.
He put up a great performance at Caulfield. The
doubt about him this time turns on the question of
jocke.vship. Lewis may not ride him, and a less
powerful horseman may fail to get the nervous animal
into a good position ere the critical point is arrived
at.
To the writer’s way of thinking, a dozen horses
are Melbourne Cup possibles. Even St. Spaza has a
chance on his Adelaide Cup performance, and Cyklon
is a good one occasionally, whereas the handsome
Lingle has never yet been very good in public.
Prince Bardolph is a sticker that commands respect,
and Carlita’s record of rich victories gives her the
appearance of being worth backing with 9st. 51b. up.
But if Carlita is worth considering, Bursar must be
a second-to-none chance. He and his stable com-
panion Quinologist, both from England, proved them-
selves genuine stayers on the last day of the A..T.C.
meeting. Bursar had bedn backed for Melbourne
Cup before Quinologist was thought of as a real good
one. His own peonle had under-rated the winner of
the Met. because Bursar was reckoned so much better
over a distance. Judged bv his brilliant run past
Carlita in the Rand wick Plate l'ace. Bursar is at the
top of the first class. He looks a champion, and is
greatly fancied by many of the Sydney shrewd-heads.
The writer prefers Bursar to Sheoherd King, Amata
-nd the best of the three-vear-olds, whichever that
jay be. .
When Wolaroi ran so badly in the A.J.C.
Derby his owner, Dan Seaton, remarked that the
colt would beat Kilbov in Melbourne. Whether he
will is to be decided on Saturday in the V.R.C.
Derby. Kilboy, at time of writing, is a red-hot
favorite and likely to remain that way. Wolaroi has
a lot of friends, but outside the pair nothing is
really in tlie market, although Stageland, httefieJ
and Eastcourt have had occasional backmg.
Randwick Wolaroi was last until nearing the straight
entrance, and his fast run took all the steam out o
him. By the same'token, Kilboy was also in the ea
less than a mile from home, and was
when six furlongs remained to be rum How Woiaioi
or any other horse in the Flemington Derby is gp
to beat this Maoriland colt The Bulletiit will be
able to see when it happens. At present thisi paper
is not satisfied that the relative merits ot Wolaroi
and Kilboy have been properly established.
Of tile four imported horses that
Wheeler’s stable contributed to the Caulfield Cup the
winner and Aides were the handsomest, Green Gap
was the neatest, and Sunbury the least fit m condi-
tion as well as the youngest of the party. Green
Cap and Shepherd King are of the'same age, and
have the same sire—Martagnon. Aides is a year
older, and he sometimes looks as though he would
rather be at home with the ladies than go trying to
win races. * i # *
Shepherd King’s capture of the Caulfield
Cup was apparently a deep-laid scheme, with
“Bobby” Lewis at the root, of it. -The' horse was
imported by F. H. Lewis, who is generally supposed
to be more or less connected with brother Bobby in
these matters. Ite was sold to the owner of Patrobas,
for whom Lewis rides, with the proviso of a iui thei
payment if he won a Cup, which was practically a
proviso that Lewis would have the mount in the
Cups. Bobby took great pains before the race to
assure himself that Shepherd King could gallop faster
than any of the others. He went out of his way to
ride various candidates at exercise on the track.
Having left himself no room for doubt as to the gee s
superiority at the weights, he made no secret of his
belief that he would bring. off the coup. The fact
that he allowed the nervous animal to drop into last
place before bringing him along on the outside ot
the field was proof of Bobby’s confidence in the good
thin «-
Probably the wetness of the Spring had
something to do with the all-round success of English
horses at Randwick and Caulfield. Soft going comes
natural to them, whereas a lot of Australian nags
gallop best on an ironclad course. Besides, the limbs
of the imported ones are not very tough, as a rule,
and if they don’t actually break down in the course
of training when the ground is hard they are very
likely to go lame, more or less.
* * * *
The four-year-old Rael Locin made his
first appearance on any sort of racecourse at Leon-
gatha (Vic.) in February last, when he ran nowhere
in the local Cup. Later, he entered a training
stable, and faced the starting-barrier at Aspendale
and Moonee Yalley'-hr July. When he ran second to
High Rock at the -V.R.C. -October meeting he was
still so green that the roar of the crowd bewildered
him, and he turned his head to see where the noise
was coming from when he should have been sticking
to business. But for this Rael Locin would have
been the actual winfier on that occasion. A week
later the novice was sufficiently seasoned to win the
Toorak Handicap in a very resolute style, although
he was suffering from an abscess in the mouth.
This was lanced the same night, after which he
regained his normal appetite- for meals. •
*"* * *
The little Maoriland mare Bee had bad luck
to rrtiss the Cup at Moonee Valley (Vic.) last week. She
started favorite at 7 to .2, but on the journey the
saddle slipped and when she looked like a winner
at the distance she got jambed close into the rail.
This gave Andelosia the chance to collar the cash
with a few inches to spare from _ Lucky Escape and
the imported mare. As Andelosia was a 20 to 1
chance, MacShortodds felt that the war was nearly
over. This was Andelosia’s second win since the
autumn, but the stable was not at all sweet on his
chance owing to the poor showing he made at the
V.A.T.C. meeting. He cost 900 guineas as a yearling,
and at three years had a good innings, canturiiTg
among other events the Caulfield Guineas, Linlith-
gow Stakes, St. Kilda Cm) and the Club Handicap
at Rosehill. The weight-fixer for the Caulfield Cup
reckoned him a stone better horse than Shepherd
King. But the owners had a different opinion, and
pulled him out after the Coongy Handicap. The
time at Moonee Valley (2min. s|sec.) is a record for
the race.
* * * *
Zuland, the Maoriland sprinter, is a
profitable moke. Since he came across the Tasman
a few months back he has won six races, the - latest
being Moonee Valley (Melb.) Welter Handicap on
Saturday. The secret of Zuland’s success is the
astute manner in which he is placed. People behind
him are content with small prize-money events, and
have been fortunate in always getting good prices.
His figure on Saturday was 14 to 1 against. Zuland
is a nice-looking rag, and can carry a bit, so his
future position in the weight-list may not altogether
put an end to his usefulness.
* * * *
The Sydney sprinter Lord Malt had been
backed in several six-furlong dashes lately, but with-
out hitting the front at the right moment until
Saturday. Starting at 7 to 4in the Flying at Canter-
bury Park that afternoon his Lordship did what the
punters wanted. There was some ease, too. about the
effort. He didn’t have am thing of much class against
him; but it looked as if he might be able to do the
same thing on the smaller courses when asked.
* * * *
When an animal comes from the country
with a boom on it the public does not inquire into
the why and wherefore too closely. It simply takes
things for granted, and proceeds to separate Mo from
his cash. Thus word went round that Davy Buchanan
was the best of good things for the Park Stakes at
Canterbury (Sydney) on Saturday. Result—s to 4
David, 8 to 1 bar one. One of the unbarred ones,
Lutana, which a week earlier had appropriated a
maiden event at Warwick Farm, led to within a
yard of the post before Davy realised the importance
of his mission. Then he poked his head in front.
About a year ago Davy was produced in an event
at Randwick and backed for a hatful. He didn’t
materialise, and was taken back to the woods to
browse on the small stakes hung- up by the hayseed
clubs.
*** * i
Trainer Frank McGrath’s Plenty threatens
to live up to his name. After delaying for inearly
a year Plenty has taken two Sydney suburban handi-
caps in succession—at Warwick Farm and Canter-
bury Park. Before the better class horses get back
from the pursuit \of larger lucre in Victoria, Plenty
might grab something else. Medley, the irriported
mare in Tomlinson’s stable, was labelled good! goods
for the last event Plenty annexed, and thq label
looked as if it was a true bill towards the | finish.
But just as the person with his cash on started out
to collect she shut up like a pub at 6 o’clock.
Medley has won a few races, but on the prospectus
scarcely looks like a payable proposition.

the limelight, and after the big march of sddiers

the Derby and Gudary in the Cup at the ' .K.o.
meeting. Gudary, half-brother to a former winnei,
Galamia, was thought to be a sure thing at 7st. 71b.
The stable pooled its cash and took a wagei vuth
Miller, Jones and O’Brien in one hand of £»0,000
to £lOOO for the double. Navigator gave them a
l eff in. Gudary was saddled fit and well, Gainsford
was hoisted into the saddle, and the stable prepared
to give three cheers. But there was trouble at the
post Cunnamulla badly kicked .Gudary in the stifle
joint, and he could get no nearer than third, pulling
up lame. * * *
Desert Gold, Maoriland’s crack gee-gee,
had her first race as a four-year-old in the Cham-
pion Plate (1-1-mile) at Wellington the other day
and showed the other nags that they were not going
to win many w.f.a. races this year. On the extreme
outside at the start she was two furlongs in front
when the rails were reached, and she got to the post
in front of an abandoned field in 2mm. 7sec. lhis
was the mare’s 15th consecutive win. Punters put
up a pound to win *3s. # #
“The Jonah”: Hard mozzle? Well, some
years ago 1 drew a horse in each of five sweeps on
the Caulfield Cup, and the whole five nags were
mixed up in the great smash of that year. The
jockey of one (Robin Hood) was killed. In the Mel-
bourne Cup the same year I had tickets in eight
sweeps. In each sweep there was a sport, and
that meant one blank. Now a what do you think.
I drew every blank. Luck, not satisfied about its
treatment of me, came at me again, there was a
10s. sweep on the Steeple and two blanks. When
one horse and a blank were left in the hat a mate
bet me a pound to-a shilling that I would not draw
the blank. I'didn’t, but I drew a prad that failed
to start. Can anyone beat me as a Jonah?

“Hydros”: How’s this for keeping the
honors in the family? The Grafton Cup, run-last
July, was won by Norbury, with Nojah and Noviro

Art Magirl, ex-wrestler and gymnast,
handed over the slumber punch for the second time
to Dave Smith. He did it on Saturday at Mel-
bourne. In the sixth collision Smith intercepted a
glove with his chin, got up to see what was the
matter and shaped a right which ended the argument,
Dave’s showing was very moderate. He has been
getting more hidings than are good for him.

Ned Fitzgerald was presented with some-
thing heavy by Wave Geike in the second round of a
disturbance at Brisbane Stadium on Saturday. He
took three, helpings, and before he wanted another
Geike was half-way home. How these coming cham-
pions do fizzle out! # #
Les Darcy threatened last week to do two
things—go to Melbourne and biff George Chip on
Monday and then enlist. Well, he may do both all
right, but last Saturday there was any amount of
betting to be got that he wouldn’t be in Melbourne,
and up till Tuesday the people who knew his
previous address didn’t know where he had been
for several days. And amid the prevailing uncer-
tainty another opponent for Mr. Chip was being
eagerly searched for.
* * * *
If Darcy strikes U.S.A. before he strikes
the slide and can get away with Mike Gibbons, there
would be no question at all about the middleweight
championship. It would he his in the eyes of every
promoter and barracker in the world. A 1 McCoy’s claim
to the thing is a joke. If Jeff Smith is seriously in
the picture, a conflict between Darcy and him would
be worth about two cents to see. But.the great battle
to be pulled off by Darcy, if he ever gets a chance, is
with Jack Dillon, now at the top of the tree m
Yankeeland. That would be a _ rousing fight for
Americans, and a big scrap to win. Heaven knows
how long it may be before the disturbance happens!
This page hasn’t a book on the subject; but as Darcy
explained a few days ago that he had no intention of
going to America while the war lasted, and as Mr.
Dillon has not arrived in Australia, the future looks
as doubtful as the interior of a deep, dark well.
Meanwhile someone whispers into this paper’s ear
that the press agents are putting in some fine work.

Yankee sports and imitations thereof are
wondering whether Willard will ever fight again. If

ture of shedding Jcwt. of tissue is not one of the
things he wants to endure. He is just on 30, too.

Fred Kay is the most awkward proposi-
tion in pugs a brother practitioner can be summoned
to subdue. Kay boxes the reverse end up, so to speak,
and does the wrong thing with great success when he
ought to be doing something else and getting into
trouble. To a man shaping in the natural way with
left foot and glove in the lead, the spectacle of Kay
with his right boot and hand in advance, crouched
down alongside an easily swinging left, is an appari-
tion weird enough to make the average pug burst into
tears; For he is clean out of reach, and a boxer who
cannot be touched and is mounted on a pair of freak
legs and can duck and squirm away from assault takes
a lot of mastering. Jimmy Clabby tried his fist at the
job on Saturday at Sydney Stadium, and the lanky
Westralian fooled and outboxed him all the way.

Grav’s best effort, and Lindrum did 202. There was
nothing to rave about in that. In the second week

he helped himself to £2OO and the game.

An old-timer who keeps his identity under
cover is George Fearn, of Gladesville (N.S.W.). Away
back in 1879, Fearn, Captain Webb (who crossed the
English Channel and was afterwards Hleo, at
Niagara Falls) and a couple of others started in a
six-day swimming event (14 hours per day) at Lam-
beth (Eng.) baths. Webb won. Webb and learn
met in 1881 in a six-days’ match (12 hours per day).
Webb again won. What pluggers they were! Alto-
gether, Fearn captured about 00 trophies, great
massive silver medals in particular ; but an enterpris-
ing Bill Sikes of the period got the majority alter
they .had been shifted to Australia. In those bygone
days George started (with son Harold and Peter Sulli-
van) to build racing boats, and the shells they turned
off easily held, a monopoly in- the sculling world.
Rheumatism now reminds the old-timer of the swims
of long ago. * * »

They reach the straight. The noise and cheering dies.
Kilboy and Shepherd King cling close together.
Now Sasanof his splendid metal tries ;
There’s not the width between them of a feather.
The fancied bay has done his final dash.
The Maorilander hustles like a winner.
Lord ! Here’s the Sydney horse that bears my cash—
It’s Lingle creeping up, as I’m a sinner!
Kilboy in front! No ! Sasanof takes charge.
Out of that bunch it’s hard a horse to single.
They’re neck and neck. The shout grows hoarse and
large.
The push is yelling “Lingle, Lingle, Lingle!”

“WITH HEALTH
Everything is a Source of Pleasures
; —without it, nothing - else, whatever it may be, is enjoyalale.
Even the other personal blessings—a great mind, a happy
temperament—are degraded and dwarfed for want of it.
Everything should be made secondary to health.”
There’s no reason why you should not be healthy—Nature
intended you to be so.
The various organs of your body have certain functions to
perform. It is your duty to see that these organs are not
overtaxed or run down, which will prevent them from pro-
perly fulfilling their respective functions. For instance,
constipation, indigestion and other disorders of the system
are the direct result of your internal muscles being much
below normal —failing in their duty.
My exercises pay. particular attention to the muscles that
, govern the action of the stomach, liver and bowels, and
quickly bring them back to a healthy state again.
Surely you want to enjoy the best of health ? Then why
not write to-day for full particulars of my
POSTAL COURSE OF HEALTH AND STRENGTH
CULTURE ?
This is proof of what I say.
Dear Sir, —I am writing to you to let you know
how I am getting - on, after a month’s course of your
Physical Culture. 1 am feeling splendid, and must say I
am very pleased with the result of the* exercises, I have
gained 101 b. in weight, and am feeling really well.
(Signed) P.D.R., Dookie (Victoria.)
Many hundreds of letters from pupils all over Australia and
New Zealand are in the same strain.
I should like you to have my booklet, HEALTH AND

How I Darkened My
Grey Hair.
Lady Gives Simple Home Recipe That
She Used to Darken Her Grey Hair.
For years I tried to restore my grey hair
to its natural color with the prepared dyes
and stains, but none of them gave satisfac-
tion and they were all expensive. I finally
came across a simple recipe which I mixed
at home that gives wonderful results. I
gave the recipe, which is as follows, to a
number of ihy friends, and they are all
delighted with it. To 7oz. of water add a
small box of Orlex Compound and loz. of
bay rum. These ingredients can be bought
at any chemist’s at very little cost. Use
every other day until the hair becomes the
required shade. It will not only darken
the grey hair but removes dandruff and acts
as a tonic to the hair. It is not sticky or

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS OF
TheNation&l Bank of Australasia
LIMITED.
The Balance-sheet of-the Bank as on 30th September last, and the Profit and Loss Account for the
half-year which then terminated, are now submitted to the shareholders.
The net profit, after deduction of all expenses, including £12,563 3s. lOd. for Note, Income and
Lai d Taxes, amounted to . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . £78,429 11 0
Add balance brought forward from previous half-year . . . . . . .. 12,101 13 11
Leaving available .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. £90,531 411
It is proposed to appropriate the profit for the half-year, £78,429 11s., as follows: —-
Reduction of Bank premises Account . . . . . . . . . . £5,000 0 0
Dividend at the rate of 7 per cent, per annum on Preference Shares 10,702 6 0
Dividend at the rate of 7 per cent, per annum on Ordinary Shares. . 41,735 8 0
Transfer to Reserve Fund Account (making it £630,000) . . . . 20,000 0 0

vious half-year, makes the total to carry forward . . . . . . . . 13,093 10 11
£90,531 4 11
The increased amount of expenses for the half-year, as shown by the Profit and Loss Account com-
pared with previous statements, has been caused almost wholly by increased pay to the staff and other
employees during- the term.
During the half-year the branches at Broome Hill and Quirading and the agency at Kukerin, in
Western Australia, were closed, and the Wongan Hills branch, in the same State, converted into an
agency, and an agency was opened at West Leederville, also in Western Australia.
The agency at Whorouly, in Victoria, was closed.
The total number of the Bank's staff who have enlisted with the Australian Expeditionary Forces is
now 289, oi' whom 60 have joined since our last report.
In all, 15 of the Bank’s officers have been killed in action or died of wounds, including five during
the past half-year, viz.: —
Lieutenant O. V. Richardson, of Adelaide Office.
Sergeant E. M. Peart, of Horsham Branch, Vic.
Sergeant G. D. A. Gallagher, of Mildura Branch, Vic.
Corporal B. Humphris, of Moonta Branch, S.A.
Lance-Corporal J. B. Brooks, of Strathalbyn Branch, S.A.
Donations to the various War Relief Funds during the half-year amounted to £2lOO.

The customary Auditors’ Report and the Statement of the Directors and Chief Manager to comply with

E. H. WRF.FORD, Chief Manager.
That bright young man, Kenneth Cross,
A.A.M.C., has been rewarded with a job in
London as assistant-director of medical ser-
vices. His majority came in tiie same prize-
packet. Major Cross is a son of "Ada Cam-
bridge,” which is to say Mrs. George Cross,
sometime yicaress of Holy Trinity, Williams-
town, who used to write novels in the vicar-
age breakfast-room while the Rev. George
did his sermons in the library and little Ken-
neth chased beetles in the back garden. The
new assistant D.M.S. married Trixie Wal-
pole, a daughter of that Robert Walpole who
carved his name on public notice as secre-
tary and chief platformist of the Employers’
Federation for a number of years.
There is a fascinating French officer
about Melbourne just now on leave. I don’t
know his name, but his beautiful clothes
call for notice. The khaki blouse has bell
sleeves and is fastened at the left shoulder
with three buttons, while a belt bunches in
the blouse-tunic to make a frilly ballet skirt.
The Forrest dame, who has no daughter
of her own, is very devoted to niece Muriel
North, and gives her a lovely time, always
bringing her on her trips to Melbourne. Auntie
Forrest says that her niece narrowly escaped
being Lady Muriel, as her father missed the
chance of being heir to the Earldom of Guil-
ford by a fluke. The Earl of Guilford, was in-
considerate enough to marry a second wife
late in life, and a son was born to inherit
the title and estates. Muriel has a brother,
Charlie North, who 4eft Westralia early in
the war, and lie is now flying for his coun-
try. He has a pretty talent for song com-
position and owns a powerful baritone voice.
Bob Jeffries (son of the alderman), who
is in France, took a baby native bear as a.
mascot. The little Australian died of the
cold before he reached England, but was
alive and hearty when his crowd were going
through France. The Grand Republic loved
him, for he was the first of his kind to arrive
with an army. Bob has sent back a portrait
of the late lamented and a sorrowiul
account of his 12 hours’ illness. His last
words were, “Australia, sun and gumleaves!”
It is no use protesting—we’ve got to
wear our hair on top! The fashionable
high-boned collars demand it. The very
newest idea in hairdressing is the coil flat
on the top in the manner that was called
“Russian” some 15 years ago. Also, we are
assured that “more hair is to be worn,”
which means that the hairdressers are busy
compiling switches, pads, transformations
and other frauds.
The Girls who Stayed at Home have been
resting for a few weeks and gloating over
the £2OOO made by their amateur song-and-
dance. They begin again at The Playhouse
on November 24.
There are to be no frisky young things in
the female police force of Victoria—not if
the National Council of Women has its way.
Recently Chief Secretary McLeod asked the
N.C.W. to nominate a couple of Jane Bob-
bies, but the Council rejected the suggestion,
while volunteering the opinion that Jane’s
age should not be less than 40. Probably the
Chief Sec. will be obliged, in the end, to put
an advt. in the papers, calling for not-tco-
tenders for the job.
Dancing for grown-ups being considered
over the odds, one or two matrons are airing
their best ballrooms with flapper frivols —
not showy, expensive affairs, you know, but
just quiet gatherings for schoolboys and
girleens. Mrs. Donald Mackinnon hostessed
one on a recent Saturday, just a week after
the Toorak Parburys had obliged.
Irene, one of the lengthy Kiddle sister-
hood, has gone to England to see if she can
give a hand with Red Cross work. She will
drop in at Ceylon to take tea with the
Algers, who grow it. Mrs. Alger (once
Lassie Forbes) has just fled back to her
husband and the dear, faithful coolies, after
a few weeks’ holiday in Melbourne.
The wife of manager McCrae, of Dalgety’s,
has returned to N. S. Wales after tripping
to Melbourne-to see her mother, Mrs. Dill,
who had injured her hip. These accidents
are no joke when one is 90 years of age.
Another of the old pioneer breed to survive
a bad mishap is the Turnbull widow, who
was nearly asphyxiated by fumes from a
bath-heater. Her daughter and son-in-law
Bob Simson have crossed from their N. S.
Wales squattage to cheer the invalid on to
convalescence.
Lieut. Hugh Anthony, younger son of one
of our local timber men, whilst helping to
shell Huns, was wounded and taken prisoner.
After days of worry, a cable from the Rhine
side fluttered across to his anxious parents
saying young Hugh was on the mend and
quite happy. Of course. If he was dis-
contented or hungry a cable saying so
wouldn’t be allowed to travel far.
Promoters of the Patriotic dinner which
had to be turned into a hospital charity spree
are demanding to know the reason why the
War Council, after refusing a permit for
their proposed patriotic gorge, countenanced
the one at the Oriental last Friday, organ-
ised by Mrs. Harry Emmerton on the Red
Cross ticket. The War Council allows only
a certain small percentage (5 p.c. at most)
to be sunk in expenses. And you can't ruin
a proper gorge on the lines of a shilling’s-
worth of banquet to every 19s. worth of
patriotism, even though wines do go in as an
extra.
Hats are worn on the nose. The wide,
semi-transparent brim sends a flicker of
light and shade on the buried eyes of the
face beneath. And that’s all you see of the
spring-time maiden’s glances.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

THE woman who tries Bostock shoes for the first
time realises, as soon as her foot slides hmne,
that here- is something different, something
easier and more flexible, than anything she
has vet dreamed of. Then, when she steps out m
them - ', what an exultant feeling she has of lightness,
buoyancy and freedom. On the top of this, too, theie
is that delightful confidence and assurance that come
of bcino- well-dressed and knowing it.- Bor Bostock
shoes are always designed with one eye on the
fashions of the day and one eye On the ultimate sat-
isfaction of the wearer. The result is shoes so well
fitting and so easy*, that they feel just like one s best-
loved old pair, yet so dainty, so, original, so
thoroughly well-made that they look and, after quite
a lot of wear, continue to look the newest and smart-
est things imaginable.

right. .. . .Tas. Burton: .Tames, have you no respect for

some vigor into your w0rk...... Rosella: Correct
verse, without . lift or inspiration. .. .V.F.K.: No-
thing Reybo: Verse like that should be easy to
do. F’r.iji stance -
I always stood upon my tee.t,

very lumpy. Miles below standard, .. . May Jay: Not
for us. Try a daily paper.... J.A.R.: Sell some-
where else R.M.: “Light Love” nearly, but not

tangle of “yon” and “thou,” marry her by all means.

original is pretty awful verse, anyhow... .A.E.G.:

IN
BANANA LAND
T. W. McCawley, Bananaland’s youthful
Crown Solicitor, has had a very successful
run lately. His recent trip to England saw
the State on top in the steamship Eastern
case; and the High Court verdict in the
just-decided stock action was another win.
These two wins alone saved the State any-
thing up to £85,000 in damages, not to men-
tion costs. When not in court McCawley
fills his leisure moments as Under-Secre-
tary, for Justice, Public Curator, Registrar
of Titles and Commissioner for Stamps.
Over 40 years ago the labor schooner Lady
Belmore, with 130 blackbirds aboard, met
a cyclone outside Alackay and went aground
on East Point beach, just opposite the town.
No lives were lost, and as it was impossible
to refloat the ship she was dismantled. The
Harbor Board opened a quarry in the
vicinity some time ago and the old wreck
attracted the attention of a newly-arrived
ten-bob-a-day quarryman. He spent one
recent Sunday digging the soft sand from the
wreck and then dynamiting the Aluntz-metal
spikes and keel plates. llis day’s work
netted him £B4.
Up at Townsville they are not so pre-
occupied with the horrors of war that they
can’t spare a tear for local atrocities. -For
instance, an alderman made an epic speech
the other day about the terrible state of
tJie roads and the agonies of simply going*
home:—■ &
Recently a male resident returning home on his
bicycle lost a whole set of teeth through the jolting,
whilst m the same vicinity a man driving- along had
the wheel of his buggy turned inside out. People
had frequently to take off their boots and stockings
to reach then- homes, and even had to proceed to
gii eater lengths when the tides were high. One most
piteous instance was that of a lady who was wheel-
ing a baby in a perambulator, when she struck a
hob user the perambulator, spilt the babv, and in
hr- struggles to save herself and the infant broke her
gaiters and both stockings came down.
What does bleeding Belgium amount to now?
Ryan had the last laugh in his argument
with Hughes about copper. The little man,
who is obsessed with the painful idpa that
he has cleaned up the metal problem and
that nobody else has done a thing, was
grieved when Ryan announced that he had
made a contract with the British Alunitions
Department, the latter agreeing to take the
State’s metal at £lOO per ton for two years.
Hughes couldn’t understand how Air. Ryan
could say such a thing—why, he (Hughes)
had had the matter in hand long before Ryan
ever went to England, and the business had
only just this moment been completed. Then
Ryan said he couldn’t understand how
Hughes came to fail in like that, because the
copper Hughes had sold wasn’t the metal
he (Ryan) had sold at all. The facts seem
* to be that, hoping to get some of the old
copper mines started, Ryan persuaded the
Alunitions Department to take up to 48,009
tons in the next two years at £lOO per ton
c.i.f. London, whereas Hughes’s sale was of
the output of copper from the big producing
mines (Alorgan, Lyell, Wallaroo, etc.),
i .tailing, it is expected, about 50,000 tons,
at £l2O per ton. On the present figures
Hughes seems to have made the better bar-
gain. But there is this to be said, of course
Hughes had something to sell; Ryan
merely wanted to get a firm offer which
might induce abandoned mines to get busy.
A FAIR OFFER.
RECRUITING SERGEANT: “Hello, Jacky, why don’t you enlist?”
JACK : “What, me enlist—what about Misser Jones, mine boss, enlistin g?”
R.S.: “Oh, Mr. Jones can’t enlist — he’s got too much land and cuttle to lcok after.”
JACKY: “Well, if Misser Government give me a thousand acres, I go and fight for him
every day the week.”
“Thirsty I”: In view of the proposed issue
of ss. notes, the whole question of design
should be reconsidered. The half-sovereign
note is responsible for many cases of fraud
because its shape and color are so much like
those of the pound note. The addition of
the words “half sovereign” is not such a
safeguard as the Treasury officials imagine.
With a little manipulation, which the writer
is not going to advertise here, the words
lend themselves to the working of a beauti-
ful sivindle. Up here in Torres Strait,
where there are crowds of simple Australian
aborigines, unscrupulous Asiatics and others
practise it 24 hours a day. I know of a
banker in these parts who refuses to circu-
late the ten-bob mistakes because he con-
siders that he would be aiding and abetting
fraud by handing them out. The notes
ought to correspond somewhat in size
with the values they represent, with the said
values clearly marked in commercial signs
without embellishment. Let us have some-
thing like the old Bananaland issues.
Kiosk in Wonderland.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I built a gay kiosk in Wonderland
And garnisht it. with many a painted dream;
1 built it ou a shining golden strand
With gentle outlook on a silver stream;
And daily did I gather comrades there
With dancing eyes of youth and gleaming hair,
And daily did I hearken to their songs
And fresh my heart at little fountains fair.
Within that gay kiosk of Wonderland
We kept Aladdin and his magic ring,
And one grave Pasha, bearded, tall and bland,
AVho came from Khiva’s Khan or Herat’s King.
And one day when we played a lovely play
There came a knock; and when we said “Come
in!”
The door was opened by a Bottle bold
And from the Bottle slowly rose a Djinn.
That gay kiosk of mine in Wonderland
Held all the Fairies like a book of gold;
Titania decked her Ass before the band
And Puck performed the tricks he knew of old ;
Brown dwarfs attended when you clapped your hands,
And weirdest songs were chanted by a shee,
And blue-eyed pages served you all with wines,
And smiled upon you from their bended knee.
Of course that gay kiosk in AVonderland
Had gruesome Caves a-winding underground
Where lurked at times old Ali’s robber band
AVho’d cut your head off if they heard a sound.
(You see a gay kiosk would not be gay
Unless it kept somewhere a kind of thrill
And thrills are only found in caverns deep,
Where someone lurks who knows the way to kill.)
Also, that gay kiosk in Wonderland
Had latticed easements opening on the sea;
At one a Princess sweet with lily hand
Sat weeping tears as salt as salt could be.
(AYe’d found her in an ancient fairy tale
And brought her in to soothe her bitter woe:
It seemed so kind to help a dear Princess
Whose griefs occurred a thousand years ago.)
To-day I’ve got a palace on a hill,
I bought it all with hardly-gathered gold;
Its gardens shine by many a rippling rill,
And lovely flowers its recent walls enfold;
And yet....l’d gladly change it any day
For one I built upon a golden strand
When Youth was lord of every laughing hour
And that kiosk was mine in Wonderland.
QUEENSLAND.

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, October 28, 1916.
My Dear Thargomindaii, —
Her Ex. was the instrument that opened
the Arts and Crafts sale of work the other
day in aid of the Red Cross Society. As a
business agent she wins, because the stalls
were cleared almost as soon as she approved
of them. On the tables were some very
beautiful samples of work, particularly in
pottery, glazed and unglazed, all the products
of the Central Technical College. The founda-
tion clay was local—a lesson for politicians
and other anti-Australians. Purchasers
almost came to blows over the bargains. The
potters included Airs. Devereux, Alisses
Payne and Vera Affleck.
And we’ve found a genius. Her name is
Agatha Fitzgerald, and book-illustrating is
her gift. Australia’s beautiful fairy-tales
will owe a lot to her. You just wait and see.
Jean AleWhirter. daughter of James
AlcWhirter, the well-known Brisbane mer-
chant, has accepted a finger-band from Capt.
Charles Drew, of the British Army Medical
Corps. The knot-tying happened at Logie,
near Stirling.
The Queen Carnival resulted in an easy
win for the soldiers’ nominee, Mrs. Lee. As
a result of the competition about £3OOO was
diverted to the funds of the R.S. Residential
Club. Airs. Blume, representing the sports
bodies, was second in the race. Her hus-
band handed over 100 guineas as a gift
towards furnishing the Club.
Woman has invaded another of the sacred
precincts of the male worker in the back
country. At Carrar and Ballindallocli shear-
ing-sheds women are cooking in the shearers’
huts in place of the male “poisoner,” who has
enlisted. Ballindallocli had a procession of
three of them in one week, so the new regime
promises little improvement on that of the
male dough-puneher.
Claude, the straight-eyed son of chief
traffic-manager Lloyd, of Brisbane, who left
Australia with the rank of corporal, has
gained the D.C.M. and a commission. Ac-
cording to the young man’s own letter there
is but one brief explanation of the distinction
sheer luck. ’ But don’t believe it —wait
the official details.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
“B.B.”: Bowen lias just scored, another
triumph over its hated rival Townsville. A
vessel, which the Censor says does not exist,
before leaving for Zep-land, recently took in
a supply of 160,000 gallons of Don River
water, the scarce Townsville commodity being
passed as of too-poor quality.
On the disadvantages of being a sheep:—
The lot of the Queensland jumbuck is rot all that
it’s cracked up to be. Flocks had just got through a
couple of years of drought to find that in many
places they were up against the dingo, and now every-
where the blowfly is their special curse. When the
monsoonal muggy weather arrives the scourge pro-
mises to be worse th<in on &ny previous occasion.
The fly is of the bottle-green variety. It “strikes”
sheep on any damp portion of the wool, and the
maggot hatches in a few days and proceeds to eat its
way in channels up over the sheep’s back underneath
the wool. In a fortnight to three weeks these mag-
gots drop off the unfortunate animal, if it is still
alive, in thousands, burrow into the first bit of soft
soil, and in a week or two again arrive on the scene
a rejuvenated, full-blown pest. Immediately a jum-
buck is struck it starts to lose condition, and young
ewes and weaners seem to give up all interest in
life. They lie down and die very quickly. In big
flocks where the pest is bad 15 to 20 per cent, is a
common loss. Some benefit is derived by “crutch-
ing’’—shearing the wool from between the hind-
quarters and over the tail —but it is doubtful if die
benefit is commensurate with the cost.
A tale of providence and thrjft:—
They were very careful at the Old Pioneer, and
with excellent reason, for at that date the Pioneer
was getting as much as 3oz. to the truck, all coarse
stuff, and the mine was manned by a crowd of old
Geordie and Cousin Jack diggers who knew every
trick in the gold-stealing game. Of Tregaskis
Brother Spence declared: “Aye, he’s a dagger!
Bob Tregaskis would lift an ounce nugget under the
eye of the Recording Angel and leave with two
good marks.” This meant much, as Tregaskis was
a K.G. (K for cousin, G for Jack) and Spence
was a Geordie, and Geordies are notoriously con-
temptuous towards all Cornishmen. Besides, Spence
was himself an expert, with a reputation for lifting-
gold in quaint ways. When the puddlers were being-
cleaned up, the legal manager, the mining- manager
and two athletic directors of the Old Pioneer care-
fully overlooked the proceedings, each with his right
hand ostentatiously plunged in his coat pocket, where,
as the men knew perfectly well, four forefingers toyed
with the triggers of as many natty little revolvers.
You wouldn’t wonder at it: the sight of the false
bottoms of an Old Pioneer sluice-box was one to
-tempt an archangel. The management kept a
special watchman on the job too, and in addition
an expert searcher, and it was confidently believed
in the office that the diggers’ natural reluctance to
part with nuggets had at length been overcome. Then
Ernie Tregaskis went to the manager one day in the
most casual way in the world, and jerking his thumb
towards the mass of old grease and black waste by
the engine-house door said: “I s’pose a man might
take that along home you. I’d be glad of en. That’s
fine manure you, and it’s hard keepin’ a bit gardin
goin’ these days.” The manager considered the
matter. The pile of oily filth was becoming a
nuisance. “Take it,” he said. It was Ernie’s long-
shift off, and in the course of the Saturday afternoon
he arrived with a dray. There were two loads, and
Tregaskis made so neat a job of the removal that
the surface boss congratulated him on the way he’d
“cleaned her up you.” Ernie made a show of
manuring his garden with a heap of dirty waste, but
the stuff he got from the Old Pioneer went into bags,
and was carefully buried in Ernie’s stable. Not till
two years later did the Cousin Jack venture to burn
this material. It cleaned up just about what he
thought it would, 3500 z., the reward of long fru-
gality. For 19 months on coming up from below
Ernie had swirled his crib billy and absently thrown
the remaining- tea and leaves on that heap of waste.
He called this “puttin’ by a bit for a man’s old age
you.”

'J'HE BLOOD is the energiser of the system. Upon its quality
depends the nourishment of every organ, every nerve-centre,
every muscle of the body.
Poorness of Blood is called Anaemia —girls, women and men
are all subject to it.
It manifests itself in breathlessness on slight exertion, pale
cheeks, lustreless eyes, depression and exhaustion.
If you have any of these symptoms, or are run-down and need
a tonic, take Iron ‘Jelloids’ to enrich the blood.
When the blood has been enriched and strengthened, Anaemia
is overcome —the symptoms give place to abundant vitality, rosy
cheeks, and a feeling of general ‘ fitness" and well-being.

“Nick Bottom” : These frank medical ads.
give me courage to write this story. A cane-
cutter friend of mine used to delight the
camp with a pathetic ballad entitled “Eng-
land’s Great Increase in Crime,” in which,
according to the singer, the London police
swelled the crime statistics by “preventing
a poor costive monger from earning his
bread on the street.”
“The Old Soldier”
At the back of the King of Greece’s mind is a
profound admiration for the crowned murderer of
Berlin, who has for more than 30 years been the
model upon which all the minor royalties of
Europe have tried to form themselves. While the
French Government seems to have determined that
’Tino must restrain this admiration and act on the
level as a neutral, the spineless Asquith and the
British romanticists, gushing of Marathon and
Thermopylae, plead for “consideration” for the
descendants of the heroes of the Persian War, who
are supposed to have saved Europe from Asiatic
domination in the sth century b.c. Whether what
happened nearly 2500 years ago ought to make any
difference to a modern European Government in
its agony is a question that ought not to he left to
academics. In any case, it is quite certain that
King ’Tino is not a Greek, and it is very doubtful
whether many of his people are descended from
those who fought at Marathon.
More economy. Presumably in order to
let the youngster know the size of the debt
that is being unloaded on him, O’Malley has
ordered a copy of Knibbs’s three-and-six-
penny Year Book' to be sent to every one
of the 8000 public schools in Australia.
“S.L.J.” : A word with “Good Australian”
who recently wrote to suggest that the staffs
at the base hospitals in Egypt were suffering
from cold feet. I have no hesitation in say-
ing that 90 per cent, of the staff of the 3rd
A.G.H., for instance, would transfer to a
combatant unit, if possible, at an hour’s
notice. This view is supported by the num-
ber of applications for transfers received by
the 0.C., and refused by the A.D.M.S.,
owing to the dearth of experienced hospital
men. Again, I deny that the hospital
orderly’s lot is a rosy 'one. I admit that
there is not the same danger as in the firing-
line, but there are other dangers when up
against enteric, cholera, meningitis, diph-
theria and similar malignant maladies. The
toil is from morning till night, very often
for the benefit of a lot of malingering-
patients wdiose chief question is.- “When is
the next boat for Australia, mate?” or “Do
you know if they are going to ‘board’ me for
Australia?” I have known patients literally
snatched from the grave to emphatically
declare that hospital men are “cold footers,”
who ought to be in the firing-line, little
thinking how they would have fared without
the attention of the despised orderlies. We
realise that the nursing sisters are mainly
responsible for the recovery of most patients,
but every sister needs assistance. Further,
75 per cent, of those on hospital staffs have
absolutely no choice as to the unit in which
they are to serve. A large number of men are
sent away from Australia as reinforcements
to Field Ambulance units, and on arriving in
Egypt are placed in A.M.C. Details and
drafted wherever they are needed. After
lf» months’ service in the A.M.C. the
conclusion I have come to is this: that it
would be desirable to employ more “B” class
men in the hospitals. Hundreds of men are
being sent back to Australia, suffering from
minor chronic trouble or physical defect,
who could be employed in the hospitals; but
such a matter is entirely out of the control of
the hospital staffs. I trust the Commonwealth
Government will take the subject in hand,
and alter the present state of affairs so as
to permit men who are practically perfect
physically to realise their desire to be of
greater service.
Adelaide shopkeepers, on being consulted
by the S.A. Chamber of Manufactures, have
decided not to have the usual “Manufac-
Week.” They might at least stick
up a sign in their windows: “This week we
ought to be showing what Australia can do.
But we’re really too busy this year to be
bothered with Australia.” Too busy, of
course, selling foreign wares—and attending
patriotic meetings.
From “The Oldest Inhabitant”:—
A recent fire in Sydney did much damage to an
ancient Baptist Church which some years ago was
turned to commercial uses. This little Bethel is in
Castlereagh-street, a couple of doors south of Liver-
pool-street. Nearly 50 years back the pastor was
Daniel Allen, who used to cause commotions and
riots in Hyde Park on Sunday afternoons. In those
days Hyde Park —then still known amongst old citi-
zens as The Racecourse —was the debating-ground of
many sects. A prominent discuseionist was John
Rushton, a second-hand bookseller of York-street. He
had a large following, and Pastor Allen used to
chip in with abuse of the R.C.’s. These “pleasant
Sundays” were kept up until the temper of the R.C.’s
gave out, and open riots resulted. At this time
Alfred Stephen was chairman of the Hyde Park
trustees, and lived in Dynevor Terrace, College-.sti;eet.
I rom his drawing-room he could see the “fun,” and
decided at last to put an end to it, which he did
by getting the trustees to pass a by-law prohibiting
more than three persons “assembling together” in
the park. The discussions were then shifted to the
Domain, where they have ever since been carried on ;
and peace reigned on “the Racecourse.”
THE UNMARRIED HUSBAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The edict came that single men
Must join the ranks. Bill Jenkins raced
And begged Rose Green to be his bride;
When gentle Rose consent had sighed,
The wedding day arrived in haste.
Repentance, though, was quick to come,
And Jenkins waxed exceeding sore;
Although he’s paid the parson, Bill
In military eyes was still
An eligible bachelor.
He could not an exemption gain ;
Bill reckons it “a blanky cow” ;
But one faint hope he nurses yet:
“I’ll have to see if I can get
Exempted from my missus now!”

Do you feel out of humor and think that every-
one has a grudge against you, because everything
seems to be going wrong? It is you that is
“wrong,” and it is your liver that has the grudge
against you-—possibly because you are not treat-
ing it well. You have given it too much work
to do, and when it wanted a gentle laxative to
set it right, you neglected to attend to it. To
set your liver right, to make things go well, and
to make yourself feel good all over, take a course
of Chamberlain’s Tablets and you will be more
than pleased with the result. Chamberlain's
Tablets are unsurpassed for irritability.
Chamberlain’s Tablets are purely vegetable,
and contain no ingredient that can in any way
be Injurious to the most delicate person. Their
action is mild and gentle, without any of the
painful sensations experienced by the use of pills.
Chamberlain’s Tablets act as a tonic, strengthen
, the system and assist the natural movement of
the bowels.
The most common cause of constipation is a
lack of exercise necessary to keep the muscles
of the bowels active. That is why constipation
is often brought on by too frequent use of pur-
gatives. They act violently, performing the
work of the bowels for them, and so. weaken them
that they ' will not act without assistance.
Chamberlain’s Tablets will cure constipation
because, instead of doing the work of the bowels,
they gently stimulate them to voluntary action.
Their frequent use will not injure the most deli-
cate person.
Indigestion means imperfect nourishment, and
that means poor health. In these days of strenu-
ous competition it is the healthy man who wins.
Nothing equals Chamberlain’s Tablets for clear-
ing the stomach of undigested food and promoting
a flow of gastric juices which are indispensable
in the process of digestion. Indigestion always
produces a tendency to constipation, and for this
alone Chamberlain’s Tablets are invaluable.
DO NOT BE BEHIND THE TIMES,
but move with them. Salts, Castor Oil and harsh
purgatives are out of date, and have been the
cause of many a case of constipation. Chamber-
lain’s Tablets are the medicine that you want to
take. They cure constipation, indigestion, bili-
ousness, and cure them permanently, Remember
the name —Chamberlain’s Tablets—and be sure
you get them, for there is nothing “just as good.”
NEVER FORGET that upon your physical con-
dition depends your comfort and usefulness. That
your condition will be bettered, your figure in-
creased, when your bowels are regulated, your
liver stimulated and you) digestion made sound
by taking Chamberlain’s TfiMets for the stomach
and liver.
The old saying, “Coming events cast their
shadows before,” is especially true of a bilious
attack. You will have warning of its approach.
Your appetite will fail, you will feel dull and
languid and have a feeling of nausea. As soon
as any of these symptoms appear take three of
Chamberlain’s Tablets and the attack may be
warded off. By taking a course of Chamberlain’s
Tablets you will be permanently relieved of all
bilious tendencies.
When the liver and bowels don’t act, life is a
failure. Chamberlain’s Tablets wake these drowsy
organs, like the sun wakes the earth, and the
whole body laughs. It is fun to live when the
body is in good trim, but it is never so when
the liver and bowels shirk duty. There is more
happiness in a Is. 6d. box of Chamberlain’s
Tablets than you ever dreamed of. They stimu-
late the nervous system and make you feel young
again.
By allowing yourself to become constipated you
are slowly and surely poisoning yourself. When
the bowels perform their work "they expel all
poisonous matter, but when you allow yourself
to become constipated you absorb all this poison
into your system, thus laying the seeds of many
diseases. Some of the signs of self-poisoning are
headache, backache, languidness, weariness, melan-
choly, furred tongue, pasty complexion, loss of
appetite, etc. The safest antidote to such poison
is Chamberlain’s Tablets. These Tablets stimulate
the liver and bowels to act naturally and gentlv
In doing so they cleanse the stomach and nurify
the blood. v J

Tablets -
HEARTBURN-Most people know what this means
as few are exempt from frequent “ spells.”
The appetite becomes impaired, while
a severe gnawing or burning sensation
is experienced in the upper part of the
abdomen.
Heartburn is one of the many ways in
which the digestive organs express
disapproval of ill-treatment —warn you
to be careful.
Chamberlain’s Tablets for the stomach
and liver give instant relief in all cases
of heartburn, and by toning and
strengthening the stomach and bowels,
prevent a return of the trouble.
Chamberlain's Tablets are an excep-
tional remedy for all troubles arising
from the stomach, liver and bowels, and
are so mild and gentle in their action
that they can be used for children and
old folks.
You may have tried “this, that, or
the other,” but for permanent relief and
pleasurable action you will never find
anything to equal Chamberlain’s Tablets.
For indigestion, constipation, bilious-
ness, headache, sour stomach, etc, 9
nothing equals
CrUMBEPLAINSTABLCTS
J&/* The Stomach & Liver.
NO, NEVER! A man with a healthy liver
does not contract diseases. During’ recent epi-
demics in various parts of the world thousands
of people protected themselves by keeping their
livers healthy and active by the use of Chamber-
lain's Tablets.
When the food leaves the stomach without
having gone through the requisite process, as
hanpers in of indigestion, it is impos-
sible for the liver to complete the work. There-
fore, look to your stomach —strengthen and
stimulate it to perform its functions. There is
no better medicine for this than Chamberlain’s
Tablets. Chamberlain’s Tablets will cleanse
your stomach of all undigested food and restore
it to a healthy condition.
As soon as you have liver trouble you will know
it, but you may rot know that Chamberlain’s
Tablets will give you prompt and permanent
relief no matter how long standing the trouble
has been. You may be well now, but you should
bear in mind that indigestion and constipation
are Nature’s warning of future liver trouble.
Chamberlain’s Tablets taken at the first indica-
tion of either of these complaints will save you
much future suffering.
More ills result from an unhealthy liver than
from any other cause. Constipation, indigestion,
headache and biliousness usually attend it.
Chamberlain’s Tablets are a never-failing remedy
for liver disorders and their accompanying evils.
An occasional dose of Chamberlain’s Tablets
will remove all impurities and injurious sub-
stances from the system, giving tone and correct
action to the various functions of the body, thus
assisting Nature to throw off morbid influences
that tend to disease.
Headache cannot exist when Chamberlain's
Tablets are taken. Their marvellous influence
on the liver and bowels puts an end to it every
time. They follow Nature’s own method, doing
just what is needed. No other laxative ever
made can compare with theta for effectiveness.
If your liver is sluggish and out of tone, and
you feel dull, bilious, constipated, take a dose of
Chamberlain’s Tablets to-night before retiring,
and you will feel all right in the morning.

Bon Ami
to use on painted woodwork
Bon Ami looks like a scouring
soap but it is much softer and
finer, and won’t scratch. You can
use it to clean nice white paint
for instance.
The soft, porous, crumbly min-
eral in Bon Ami picks up the grime
and leaves the paint looking fresh
and new. It is a hundred times
better than soap and water and
just as harmless to the paint.
Also for windows and mirrors—
it won’t scratch even the most
delicate plate glass. And for bath
tubs, t’le and polished metal.

The NEW EDISON
Re-creations cannot be
distinguished
from the fifing voice
If you introduce into your home The NEW EDISON it will mean the
acquisition of the world’s most wonderful musical instrument. It
will mean delightful entertainment for you, your family, and your
friends, any time you care to avail yourself of it.
The acid test has been applied to The NEW EDISON. Singers and
instrumentalists have sung or played in comparison with their own
effort. Musical critics of more than two hundred leading newspapers,
after hearing these tests, admitted that their trained ears were
unable to distinguish an artist’s voice or instrumental performance
from Edison’s Re-creation of it.
The NEW EDISON is not a mere talking machine. It brings into
your home the living personality of every great artist; an instrument
that literally re-creates all forms of music in all its original richness
and beauty.

UNIQUE PROCESS FOR
RETAINING AND
REGAINING BEAUTY.
By. Mlle. Charlotte Sirier.
Does your skin chap or roughen easily, or become
unduly red or blotchy ? Let me tell you a quick and
easy way to overcome the trouble and keep your com-
plexion beautifully white, smooth and soft. Just get
some ordinary mercolised wax at the chemist’s, and
use a little before retiring as you would use cold
cream. The wax, through some peculiar action, flecks
off the rough, discolored or blemished skin. The
worn-out cuticle comes off just like dandruff on a
diseased scalp, only in almost invisible particles. Mer-
colised wax simply hastens Nature’s work, which is
the rational and proper way to attain a perfect com-
plexion, so much sought after but very seldom seen.
The process is perfectly simple and quite harmless.
** * *
It is astounding the number of women who suffer
from unsightly growths of hair on the face, and it
will come as a piece of good news to know that
there is a simple substance known as powdereil
pheminol which will remove it immediately and per-
manently. Mix a small quantity into a thin paste
with a little water, and apply to the objectionable
growths. In two minutes all trace of the hair will
have entirely vanished, and your skin will be as soft
and smooth as a child’s.
The hair should be allowed to breathe, and the
greasy film around each strand must be removed with
a mild non-alkaline shampoo. Soaps should be
tabooed. The very best solution for the purpose can
be made by dissolving a teaspoonful of stallax
granules in a cup of hot water. It stimulates the
scalp to healthy action, and at the same time leaves
the hair in that soft, fluffy condition so much
admired. Any chemist can supply you with an
original packet, of stallax, sufficient to make 25 or
30 shampoos.
One need, not resort to the very questionable ex-
pedient of hair-dye in order not to have grey hair.
The grey hair can easily be changed back to a
natural color in a few days’ time merely by the
application of a simple, old-fashioned and perfectly
harmless home-made lotion. Procure from jour
chemist two ounces of tammalite concentrate, and
mix it with three ounces of bay rum. Apply this to
the hair a few times with a small sponge and you
will soon have the pleasure of seeing your grey hair
gradually darkening to the desired shade. The lotion
Is pleasant, not sticky or greasy, and does not injure
the hair in any way. [2
The Inky Way.
At the recent N. S. Wales country press-
men’s conference the delegates compared
their contributions to the war. The Coota-
mundra Pinkstone family had a good record,
four of the sons being at the Front; but
J, N. Crowley, of Wyalong, held about the
best. He has three sons in the field and is
going into camp himself; add he has such
a crowd of relations in khaki that he has
lost count of them. All he knows is that
one brother and five nephews have been
killed.

It. T. Easterby, of Sale (Vic.). He joined
the Beechworth Constitution in ’5B, and
since then has been connected with papers
at Echuca, Bendigo, Horsham and Gipps-
land, and for a brief spell with one of the
Melbourne dailies. But city journalism was
not for him. For 34 years now he has
been editor of Gippsland Mercury, and the
chair isn’t w r orn out yet.
“Copy Boy”: Captain Frank Hudson,
author of much good Bulletin prose and
verse, was in Melbourne the other day, on
the w r ay from France to Maoriland, with a
badly damaged left wrist. As a youngster
Hudson was a lootenant in India, but left
the army to ramble the world, having a
dash at journalism here and in Maoriland,
where he was on the Otago Wit-
ness. Leaving journalism to re-enter the
army, he was a staff-officer in Maoriland,
and when W. Ilohenzollern started sending

Maoriland Anzacs are t,o have their
paper, too. The tiny sheet, mostly of color-
less cables, issued to the Australians is the
Bulletin ; the Maorilanders’ little lot is to
be the much clumsier “Chronicles of the
N.Z.E.F.” The War Contingent Assoc,
will finance it and publish it once a fort-
night in London; and Clutlia MacKenzie,
the son of High Commissioner Tom, blinded
in action in Gallipoli, will be the editor.
* * * *
The Australian forces in the field were
delighted when the Commonwealth decided
to issue an official A.I.F. news sheet; but
their delight didn’t last long. The issue of
August 13, poured into Tiie Bulletin by
disgusted Bilijims, contains 36 lines (not in-
cluding the headings, of which there are 10),
and of these 36, an account of “a sporting
contest” between Governor-General Fergu-
son and Page, M.H.R., swallow 21. Getting
to the kernel of the par.:—
The Governor-General challenged the politician
to lift himself six times on the parallel-bars. The
Governor-General succeeded easily, and Mr. Page
succeeded also, though he nearly collapsed after-
wards. The Parliamentarian then challenged Sir
Ronald to a rifle-shooting match. Out of a possible
60 the Governor-General scored 42, his opponent
replying with 48.
The other items of interest are headed
“Unshipped Australian Wheat,” “Russian
Flag Day in Melbourne,” “Tasmanian Rail-
way Appointment.” Naturally, after this
dose of dullness, one expected to read:
“Cables forwarded by the Minister for
Defence.”
“Jwosp”: Mention of lady reporters re-
minds me of the one that the Lyttelton
Times (M.L.) made local history with. She
was sent to a Council meeting when the
night errant’s contract w y as down for discus-
sion. Of course the item was adjourned. Un-
fortunately the young person was present
next week, and again the matter had to be
held over. But when the third appearance
of Miss stopped discussion the evening gentle-
man threatened action, and an apologetic
deputation from the Council, headed by the
Mayor, begged the editor of the Times to
send Rosebud to the Mothers’ Union and let
them get on with their business. The joy
of the story was that the newspaper staff
was standing by with its handkerchief in
its mouth watching to see how long the
chivalrous Council would continue to ad-
journ. We had a sweep on the number of
weeks, and the chief reporter scooped it.
“Glen H.”: J. A. Raws, formerly of the
Argus, who was lately reported “Killed in
action” in France, was found lying dead
with several others, and not one of them
showed a sign of a wound. It was shell
shock that made an end of a capital press-
man and a good fellow.
* * * #
That energetic pressman, Thos. J.
McMahon, packed his fountain-pen and
steamed across the Gulf from Thursday
Island to Darwin the other day. He has
spent several months visiting the Torres
Strait islands with a view to letting the
light on to these little-known parts of the
Commonwealth. Last year he invaded what
used to be German New Guinea, tramped
over a lot of British Papua, and doggedly
tried to keep pace with the long-limbed Judge
Murray, who is Papua's champion walker, in
a journey into the precipitous inland
country. McMahon says that racing up
5000 ft. mountains is not the game it’s
cracked up to be, The Territory and the
unholy show that the Federal Government 3s
making of things there are now occupying
his attention.
TRIPE AND ROSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A dish of tripe and a bowl of roses
Set on the board. Two eager noses
That know that the hour of joy is ripe
Are bending down —to the dish of tripe.
Roses can wait, but tripe is fleeting,
And he who’d write must now be eating.
The poet will later light his pipe
And twine the roses around the tripe.
It’s tripe and roses the livelong year,
With onions added to draw a tear.
On onion beds the Muse reposes—
Roses and tripe and tripe and roses!

Fed from birth on the 'Allenhurys ’ Foods.
on Behalf of Baby
Naturally a Healthy Mother
should feed her own child, and no cause, save inability,
should prevent her doing so. But there are many
mothers who, though willing, cannot wholly or even
partially, nurse their children. Either they have no
milk for them, or it is poor in quality and deficient
. in sustenance.
The Question then arises
what food should be given to Baby. Carefully consider
this highly important point. Remember, that the
right food, given at the proper age will lay a sure
foundation for future health and happiness. Ordinary
cow’s milk is totally unsuitable as a food for young
infants; it is acid, contains indigestible curd and is
frequently swarming with dangerous germs, especially
in summer time. FarinaceousFoodsmustnotbegiven,as
a child under seven months of age cannot digest starch.
A Satisfactory Solution
of the difficult problem of feeding children by hand is
provided by using the ‘Allenburys’ Foods. Prepared
as directed, these pure Foods closely resemble healthy
mother’s milk in composition, nutritive value and
digestibility. They are the outcome of prolonged
scientific investigation, carried out with all the resources
of wide manufacturing facilities and experience.
Decide to use
the ‘Allenburys’ Foods. By so doing the many serious
ailments which folllow the use of unsuitable food will
be avoided, and Baby will be equipped with sound
health and strength.

The Witch,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WITH witchcraft working out her spell
She wove a snare for me
And in the baleful trap I fell
Beside a summer sea.
Brown seaweed tossing on the swell
Laughed in the sunlight free.
Old was I in the game of life,
A sinner, hardened, hoar,
Keen as the blade of some long knife
A bearded reiver wore —
I had been wedded to one wife
And loved at least a score.
How should I fall in gin or snare?
How should she trick me so?
Scents of strange flowers were on the air,
The tide was creeping slow.
An old fool’s case is past repair
As all the wise men know.
Oh. hut her voice was soft and sweet,
Her hair a rain of gold,
Ten dimples on her naked feet
Were pink and round and bold ;
My heart by its erratic beat
Had too much blood to hold.
She lured me to a lonely place
Afar from friends and kin;
The wonder of her perfect face
Reproved my soul of sin ;
For it were sin and deep disgrace
Such beauty not to win.
I with the weight of forty years,
She young as sun or moon—
The hair that rippled round her ears
Was music of no tune —
Ye gods that rule a lover’s fears,
Why was I born too soon?
I heard the spell, I saw the snare,
I laughed and straightway fell
Into the .net of smiles and hair
That she had spread so well;
I took the chance and did not care
For Heaven if this were Hell.
Straight to my doom she drew me on;
I went with laughter gay.
The sun full-rayed in glory shone
And warmed the happy day.
What recked I where the world had gone—
We too were bent on play!
With bucket of green painted tin
And one small wooden spade
I toiled as navvies toil to win
A smile from that sweet maid —-
Oh, but the dimple on her chin
For all my labor paid !

PAT O’MAORI.
Lieberwurst Goes to Leeward.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rpHE little Papuan steamer the Lokohu,
400 tons, and. as her captain styled
hex 1 , much to the disgust of the long,
Yankee-faced, yellow-bearded engineer, one
goat power, loped at a painfully slow gait
westward along the New Guinea coast from
Moresby to Yule Island and Darn, with a
call at Nagheer; then to Thursday Island,
and thence where God or freight might send
her. She had picked up all along the coast
from Samarai—Cloudy Bay, Dedale,
Moresby, Red Scar Bay and Galley Reach —
a mixed cargo of copra, trochus shell, a few
hundred bags of copper-ore mined in the
Astrolabe countx-y ; ivory nuts, old copper
sheathing from an alleged wreck somewhere,
a few bales of sisal hemp as a trial shipment,
and a bulky and light collection of native
junk—arrows and stone axes and model
canoes. So she sat w r ell enough in the water
for the job that the South had sent her; and
as she made for the entrance to Hall Sound
she saw drifting north-westerly .a big barque
in trouble, her discolored iron hull lifting
high on the deep slow swell, so that the water
ran off her in cascades, the long weeds on
her bottom trailing, as she lifted, like gi’een
hair and spreading out in flat tresses as she
fell back in the sea again.
To the little, grizzle-beai’ded, red-faced cap-
tain, Tom Leggo, master of the Lokohu, she
became a derelict, and he reckoned the
probable profit of salvage in one glance at
her foul hull and her masts broken off
10 feet above the deck. To the engineer,
who had left the engine-room at the first
excited cry of the Papuan deckhands, she
told the same-tgle.
“Been drifting for weeks,” said the en-
gineer, stroking his yellow goatee, as if it
helped him to words.
“Aye,” replied Captain Leggo—“an’ by the
cut of her and the fat John Stofel over the
starb’d rail she’s a Dutchman. Port y’r
helium a bit.”
The fuzzy-haired Papuan threw the wheel
to port; the Lokohu turned from the en-
trance under the high sombre-wooded shore
and went westerly, under the counter of the
derelict. As the steamer passed around the
stern of the barque, a following sea lifted her
high out of the water; the long, drowmed
weeds trailed again, and they read her name
* n th e faded, sea-eaten letters on her stern.
‘Mulhausen—Bremen,” said Captain
Leggo. “She’s a German; round as an apple,
a carry-all.; and buoyant as a kiln o’ bricks
when she’s loaded. Man, in a sea she’d be
like Niagara Falls for’ard !”
“They must have lightened her after she
got dismasted, skipper.”
“Aye—or they’d been in Hell or Berlin by
now. Down to y’r engines, George—she’s
signallin’.”
George Farquhar padded down to his
s yning engine-i'oom and waited for the orders
o. the bridge-telegraph. Captain Leggo did
not need to look at the dismasted barque’s
signal to be sure of her distress; he rang his
e *4fines to half-speed as he came amidships
of the German; rang again for a few kicks
astern; manoeuvred the Lokohu to within a
cable s length of the Mulhausen; then
stopped his. engines, and drifted with the
barque, noting that the set was towards
breakers and a beach beyond them, and but
hve miles away.
“Lord knows how far she’s drifted,” said
Laptain Leggo to himself. “She’s had no
steerage way; so I suppose old Getsoontight
just kept her nose to it, and called himself
lucky when she didn’t turn round and
round.”
The German hailed him, asking for a tow.
■'•Where to?” shouted Leggo, back across
the heavy swells.
The big, heavy man with the Bismarck
moustache who stood by the port rail of the
barque yelled his reply, with the wind help-
ing it to the steamer.
•‘Anyvere ve can angkor in safedy.”
“How much will you pay?”
“Take me in somevere vere you can gome
aboard, und ve fix it.”
“Righto! I’ve got a hundred fathom of
wire hawser —what you got?”
"Zwei undert undt forty fadom andt forty
fadom of chain.”
“I’ll send my boat, and we’ll give you a
line till I can get you in smooth water.”
In the lee of the barque the steamer’s boat
was pulled alongside, the steamer helping
the weight of the hawser paid out by the
mate over the stern, steaming slowly ahead in
dread of a fouling of the propeller and ap-
proaching the barque nearer than the strict
rules of safety authorised. But it was well
and truly done —the line aboard the barque
fastened to the bollards forward, and the
steamer end of it to the bitts aft; the boat
picked up, and hauled to the davits. The
Lokohu, steaming a little north of east,
slowly brought the head of the Mulhausen
away from its dangerous course to the break-
ers and the beach. It all looked supremely
impudent—the little 400-ton steamer snatch-
ing from wreck that great, lumbering, sea-
beaten barque that was five or six times the
size of the rescuer, and the impotent iron
walls following as humbly as an elephant led
by a child.
Aboard the German they were glad as men
rescued from wreck on an unknown shore.
Her captain's gladness was, however, tinc-
tured, for he saw in safety the shadow pre-
ceding payment to the salvors; but the men
of the Lokohu were frankly jubilant. Far-
quhar, the engineer, figured out his share
with the second engineer; Captain Leggo
called the mate, and told him of a few im-
possible things he intended to do with the
money. Even the Papuan deck-hands were
glad, though experience might have told
them that abundantly little would be their
sbai’e. As the steamer towed the salve out
of danger the amount of the salvage in-
creased in the mind of Captain Leggo, who
. began to think himself unbusinesslike in be-
ginning the tow without a fixed reward; and.
as the barque moved to safety, the master of
her began to mentally discount the value of
the service of Captain Leggo and the Lokohu.
But, before he could fix any plan for the
depreciation of the amount of salvage. Cap-
tain Leggo had made his own way of fixing
towage at a certainty.
The Lokohu had made close into the east-
ern shore, towing the Mulhausen into the
channel that led into the bottle neck of the
Narrows and opened out again to the spa-
ciousness of the Sound. The German cap-
tain did not like his position, and every
second made him like it still less, lie looked
ahead at the little steamer, whose engines
had been described by her own engineer as
one goat power, and at the sag of the
cable towing a ship five times the weight of
the steamer, and then he saw the bottle-neck
closing in, and the white curves of broken
water. He ran to the forecastle head, or if he
didn’t run he moved at a very swift walk ; and
from the head of her he hailed Captain
Leggo. That master mariner did not seem
to hear; but he winked for his own amuse-
ment, and ordered the helmsman: “Starb’d
little-feller one.”
The German shrieked at Captain Leggo’s
back that he did not like his position at all;
he yelled even more loudly that he preferred
to be towed direct to Brisbane, or Hell.
Then Captain Leggo deigned to hear him;
and, making a megaphone of his hands, re-
plied with a statement of the impossibility of
turning in the Narrows, and his fixed belief
as a sailor that he must go on.
In further explanation the German used
all the German ixrofanity he could remember,
and eked it out with the curses of Leith and
the Tyne; he insisted on the Lokohu turning
her nose to sea; and. as she remained obsti-
nately headed for the Sound, and the broken
water opened out narrower ahead, he at last
ordered the Lokoliu’s line to be cast off, and
let the port anchor go. Then Captain Leggo
grinned to himself, and hummed his one
song—a dolorous thing belonging to the dead
past; sang it while the Mulliausen’s anchor
chain crashed down noisily to the depths:
“Please g-ive me a penny. Sir,
My mother dear is dead
Port y’r helium—hard a port, boy:
And, oh, I am so hungry, Sir,
A penny, please, for bread ;
We were not always paupers
I’ll make that squarehead buy me cake and
starb’d, my lad—port a little —keep her head
like that.”
The Lokohu came.round, and sidled up to
the portside of the Mulhausen, like a little
dog making friends with a big one. Captain
Leggo stuck a cheroot in his portside jaw,
and looked up quizzically at the master of the
German.
“What’s the row?” asked Captain Leggo,
pleasantly.
“Der row is that my ship is as nearly
wreck-ed.”
“Wait a minute ! I’ll come aboard ! For-
’ard there —throw a line aboard of her.
Chuck a line aft, and fenders out fore and
aft.”
The little steamer and the big ship came
together, rising and falling on the light sea
against the fenders. The German dropped
his pilot ladder over-side, and Captain Leggo
climbed it to the deck of the Mulhausen, and
shook hands with her captain.
In the cabin of the Mulhausen the German
captain told Leggo that his name was
Wesclie. and that the Mulhausen had been
dismasted in a hurricane off New Caledonia.
She had drifted eleven hundred and fifty
miles in ninety-seven days; and Captain
Leggo, taking in this information with a
proper appearance of sympathy, reappraised
the salvage. By now the Mulhausen must be
short of supplies and water. He came out of
his mental arithmetic to hear Captain
. Wesche still on the subject of the drift.

Zam-Buk Heals Painful Injuries.
Odd jobs about the house or garden, especi-
ally if they entail the use of tools to which he
is not accustomed, often result in a crushed)
thumb or some painful injury for the head of
the household. His wife, too, is continu-
ally “in the wars” while doing the house-
work, and scarcely a day passes
without one of the children getting
hurt in one way or another.
Cuts, bruises, burns and scalds
bring more trouble than enough as
the housewife has it—unless there’s
a pot of Zam-Buk handy. If this wise precau-
tion has been taken, each member of the
family flies to Zam-Buk for the speedy relief
from smarting pain that this soothing balm
affords, and the hurt is soon forgotten.
Zam-Buk is an ideal healer for the home
because it is perfectly antiseptic, a reliable

EVERY HOME NEEDS ZAM-BUK
PAINFUL WOUND PROMPTLY HEALED.
Mr. M. O’Regan, of 14 Nash street. East Perth, W.A., says:—“While
f hopping wood a piece flew off, inflicting a nasty, jagged wound on my
left shin. Ulceration set in and my leg swelled up to a great size. The
pain was dreadful. It being impossible to get my boot on I was unable to
go to work and I had to lay up. Inflammation spread over my leg and
extended down to my ankle, while matter was freely discharged.
“Poultices and many other remedies were tried, but with no success; instead
of getting better my leg grew worse. My daughter then got a supply of
Zam-Buk and persuaded me to try it. Commencing to dress my leg with
Zam-Buk, I was pleased to find the pain and inflammation were subdued. This
was so encouraging that I persisted with Zam-Buk until the wound was
cleansed of all impurities and healed in a perfect manner. Zam-Buk made
my leg completely better in a splendid fashion, and I was able to get about
with ease.”

For how much vill you tow us?”
It was a long argument with whisky in it
whisky brought from the Lokohu, the beer-
drinking Mulhausen being long out of beer.
Finally, the Australian and the German
agreed that the Lokohu should proceed to
Hall Sound, and do her business, the Mul-
hausen remaining anchored until her return;
the Lokohu to receive £l5OO for salvage and
£2OOO for towage payable at Singapore. Cap-
tain Leggo, as more than half-owner of the
Lokohu, regarded almost all the money as
already in his pocket. He went back gaily
to his ship, cast off from the Mulhausen, rang
his engines to duty, and ran away through
the broken water of the Narrows, singing
more cheerfully than before :
Please give me a penny, Sir,
My mother dear is dead.
He returned within 48 hours, and won
Captain Wesche’s heart and the goodwill of
the crew of the Mulhausen with gifts of
island truck —green cocoanuts, pawpaws and
bananas, taro and yams, wallaby and game.
And then they set to breaking out the Mul-
hausen’s anchor by the power of a man-
worked capstan. It took them nearly a day
to get it apeak, the long chain walking home
only a link to the minute.
And so, with a fair wind and fresh seas,
fhe Lokohu got the Mulhausen up to Singa-
pore ; and Captain Leggo, his mouth water-
ing for the dollars, went aboard to the
anchored German and found him not alone.
With him was a round-faced young German,
with Kaiser moustaches, and very alert eyes.
He was speaking earnestly to Captain
Wesche; and, to Captain Leggo,' he seemed
to be laying down the law. Their conversa-
tion was so important that they asked Cap-
tain Leggo to remain without the cabin for a
few minutes; and Captain Leggo, under-
standing not a word of German, still under-
stood from the tones that Captain Wesche
was first incredulous of the advice, and then
unwilling to act on it, and that the insist-
ence and authority of the alert young man
increased with the minutes. Finally, Cap-
tain Wesche sighed deeply, said “Aeh 1” many
times as if in deep disgust, and sighed
assent. The young man then came from the
cabin, bowed slightly to Captain Leggo, and
mounted the companion with an excited alac-
rity that seemed not to belong to a merely
mercantile mariner.
Then Captain Leggo entered Wesche’s
cabin, and was received almost affection-
ately; for the German —a good seaman him-
self—had recognised qualities in the Aus-
tralian which he could not help admiring,
while rueful of the stinging charges for sal-
vage and towage. Captain Leggo had a
whisky and then listened to the surprise of
his life.
“Gaptin Leckko,” said Captain Wesche,
“I owe you drei tousand funf undert boundts
for salvink undt towink.”
“That’s so, Captain.”
“I gannot bay that.”
“What! you make a contract, and tell me
at the end of it, when the work’s done, and
the coal’s burned, and I had to may 455. a
ton for it at Thursday and sixty bob a ton
at Port Darwin —and you’ve got the gall
to tell me you can’t pay!”
“Gaptin ! Gaptin ! Lizden to me.”
“No fear. . . .I’ll seize the ship.”
“It is dot I vant you to do, Gaptin.”
“Want me to seize her? . I don’t under-
stand !”
“Not siece—but dake. I haf the right to
zell the ship—l zell her to you.”
“But why? What for! She’s a fine, big
iron barque, and you’ll sell her for a paltry
three thousand five hundred?”
“I zell her. . . .for four sousand five undert
boundts —to pay off my grew and vill dake
me avay.”
“But why?”
“Vat is vy, if I show you I gan zell?”
“That’s 50... . show me that; and I can
get the money ashore, and tow her back to
Sydney... .But why do it? Giving me a
pot-full of money?”
“Gaptin Lecko, take my vordt I gan do
no more mit der Mulhausen ; and if there is
a man I should like to see make der money,
if I gannot make it meinself, it is you,
Gaptin Leckko. You charge me like a Yew
of Frankfurt, but I like you. Give me ein
sousand boundts, and dake der ship—is it
so?”
“Lead me to it.” said Captain Leggo, and
they shook hands.
The German sold and discharged her
cargo, and then the Lokohu took her over
as she was.
At the Bank of Australia, India and China
—a bank which never saw Australia, by the
way—Captain Wesche made good his right
and title to sell the Mulhausen. The Aus-
tralian captain gave his receipt for £3500,
and his order on Australia for one thou-
sand pounds, and the exchange thereon;
and the Mulhausen was turned over to the
mate of the Lokohu. The Lokohu lent its
Australian flap- to the Botany Bay, late the
Mulhausen, of Bremen; the port authorities
recognised the sale and gave Captain Leggo
his clearance. They put eight hundred tons
of ballast into her; and then Captain Leggo
invited his mate and engineer, and Captain
Wesche, and the lately-discharged mate of
the lately-renamed Mulhausen; and they
went forth for the evening.
It was a joyful evening—a dinner to
make sailormen forget the sea; many whisky
pegs while swapping yarns stretched luxu-
riously in the long chairs with the leg-rests
known as “Bombay flirters” ; rickshaws in
the dappled moonlight under the trees of
the quiet avenues; yet more pegs as the night
waned to dawn; hand clasps, and friendli-
ness, and farewells, as of men who under-
stand one another, from the Germans on
the beach to the Australians in the boat
bound for the anchored Lokohu.
At noon next day, as they prepared for
sea, Captain Leggo was hailed from an
outward-bound steamer. Answering the
hail, the Australian saw Captain Wesche
on the deck of the outward bound waving
his hat, and crying: “Gut bye und gut luck !”
Standing by him were his late mate and the
alert-eyed, round-faced young man with the
Kaiser moustaches.
“The Manila boat,” said Captain Leggo.
“Well! good luck to him —lie’s done me a
good turn, God knows why.”
It was a nightmare of towage. From the
Flores Sea to the Arafura, and back to the
shelter of Goode Island, they towed that big
solid block of 3000 tons capacity, built for
cargo, and too short, deep and broad for
her length. Her SOO tons of ballast was
only a mouthful for her in the seas running;
the Lokohu towed, for ever and ever, it
seemed, in the teeth of the sou’-easter. For
two days they towed at three knots an hour
in the fear of snapping the tow line; and
Captain Leggo never once sang ‘‘Please give
me a penny, Sir,” although twice, as if in
palliation of his silence, he went aft in the
Lokohu, and addressed the late Mulhausen,
once of Bremen, as “a big, ugly cow.”
“The big ugly cow” shipped seas all over
her, and rose again shaking the water off
her like a retriever regaining the land.
They had out two hundred and forty
fathoms of four-and-a-quarter-inch wire
hawser, and the late Mulhausen’s own thirty
fathoms of chain. Captain Leggo, driven to
exaggeration, described the sag as sometimes
fourteen hundred and forty feet, and, when
the Lokohu ran down one sea and the
barque lifted on another, it seemed certain
that the barque intended to come aboard the
steamer and be sociable.
Captain Leggo comforted himself with his
own tremendous optimism.
“It’s all right,” he said to Farquhar, the
billygoat-bearded engineer; “after the
straits we’re good and easy inside the reef
down to Broadmount; and then there’s the
three-knot current going south to help us
into dock.”
So at long last by trying always, which is
the way the Greeks came to Troy, the
Lokohu towed the barque through Torres
Strait, into the quiet water behind the
Barrier against the current, and down to
Broadmount, where they found the other
half of that current from the Pacific ready
to bear them south—even, if they wanted,
to Gabo, where the current leaves the coast
again and goes eastward home to the Pacific
depths where it was born.
At Sydney they learned the quick, deci-
sive methods of Captain Wesche and the
alert-eyed young man of the Kaiser mous-
taches. The papers that came aboard with
the pilot told them all —Germany at war
with the world! The alert young man.
with the Kaiser moustache had told ail that.
“He knew refitting would take a month,
and that the barque would be locked in.
but he did me a good turn, anyhow,” said
Captain Leggo. “I hope he got through.
.... She’s a good ship.”
“Please give me a penny, Sir, My mother
dear is dead,” sang Captain Leggo, as the
late Mulhausen’s anchor chain crashed to
the sea floor off Balmain.
RANDOLPH BEFORD.
The Corroboree.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE moon looks like a boomerang, that
might be circling among the birds
whose souls have wandered forth to
the stars; pale as old silver its light floats
down, touching the leaves, and making more
weird the fantastic shapes that steal through
the forest. A curlew cries, there is the hoot
of an owl, and a flying-fox passes with a
flapping of wings ; but added to these, the
natural sounds that awake in the night, is a
strange tum-tumming. Around camp-fires
that glow like beacons, where deep forest-
aisles open on to a clearing, women beat with,
their hands the stretched skins of opossums.
It is the call to the tribe to come to corrob-
oree; while nearer, nearer, between the great
trunks of giant cedars and the twisted ropes
of the lawyer-vines, draw those in whom all
the interest centres —the players of the play ;
the stars of the crude aboriginal stage;
the tribe’s warriors.
Now a chorus is added. “Mo-la-ali wingiii
clah,” the voices commence, and words that
tell how the hunters set out when the dawn
was red and the dew was on the grass, are
wedded to sounds that the singers have
learned from Nature’s own music. They
describe at length the glories of the hunt, in
which they themselves have taken no part;
for it is more seemly that woman, whose
state is low in the scale of things, should sit
at the camp-fire, and wait, wait.
This is the signal. The men burst forth,
six-score of them, their bodies covered with
grotesque markings, yellow and white and
the favored blood-fed, the clay of the creeks
having furnished the coloring. Round each
middle is the fur of an opossum, or a girdle
of human hair. The bone through the nose,
adorned at the ends with the yellow of the
white cockatoo’s crest-feathers, renders more
weird the ebon faces, touched here and there
with a phosphorescent fungus. They are
hunters, but they might be devils !
Each man carries a trophy of the hunt—
live or six opossums, a porcupine; or, slung
across his shoulders, the sinewy length of a
carpet snake. In addition to these, liis wog-
gera (a tomahawk), newry (a vine), dilly
bag, boomerangs and paddy-melon sticks.
Now the central fire is lighted to receive
the feast.
An iguana is scented. It is a stuffed
iguana, tied tp a pole that stands in
the midst of the circling fires. The
actors see it, but, having the success of
the play at heart, before tracking it they
search for its trail. Now they are hot, now
cold, like children who play at search-for-
the-thimble. At length they come upon it.
and there rises the yell, “Yi-yee!” awakening
the birds, scaring the wild creatures and roll-
ing away till it dies in the dark forest.
The trail is followed up to the pole, and
the dances begin, every movement having its
significance. It is a play without words, a
story-book written in the language of
motion.
Grey dawn looks on the scattered remains
of a feast, and among all those that lie
huddled in sleep is one who has tasted
glorious success. It is Woyjen, known to
the whites as “Gamira Paddy.”
What more can man desire? He has
given sons and daughters to the race. Now
he is the author of a corroboree! North
and south and east and west his work will
go; and when at length he wanders forth
to the stars, he will sit in the place reserved
for the Immortals!
