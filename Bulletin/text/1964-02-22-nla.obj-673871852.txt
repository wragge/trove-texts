National Notebook
One-way Ride
Tt is well known that the Sydney taxi-
driver is a very special character.
Last week we took a taxi out to South
Head. The taxi-driver got to talking:
“You’re the first feller I’ve driven out
here for a long time. The last one didn’t
come back. Darned if he didn’t duck
under the fence at the Gap and hop over.
I just got a glimpse of his hands as he
disappeared.”
The taxi-driver said he was most upset
by the experience, but he showed
masterly control. He called a daily
newspaper at once and for the news tip
he received 50s.
From Tlie Islands
TVid we realise the South Pacific islands
held art treasures and inspiration
in a profusion to satisfy any painter and
why had our local artists ignored them?
Telling our fervent ques-
tioner we’d given the
matter only passing con-
sideration, we listened
further to stocky, blond
Nicholas Michoutouchkine
champion the cause of
Oceania.
Michoutouchkine, French - born of
Russian ancestry, is in Australia to
exhibit works he has painted and
gathered during seven years’ travel in
the South Seas. He has brought with
him shy and gentle Aloi Pilioko, a
slender Polynesian primitive from Wallis,
a French island of 5000 inhabitants.
“He is completely naive and original,”
Michoutouchkine told us in a broken-
English aside. “He paints simply and
does embroidery.” Aloi smiled at us
and looked down at the sharktooth
charm he wore around his neck.
We met the two painters in the foyer
of Air France’s Sydney office with
manager Michel Taillard. The exhibition
of their own and indigenous Pacific art
opened there this month. “Our directeur
is a patron of the arts,” Michoutouchkine
told us “He organised a show when he
was managing our Papeete branch.” M.
Taillard said nothing but gave the two
an amiable hug before disappearing
into an office.
“But you must see our works,”
Michoutouchkine said, and whisked us
off to a house in Woolloomooloo. We
followed him up some rickety stairs to
a garret crowded with paintings and
artifacts. He showed us a Tiki-type god
in the act of devouring a smaller deity.
“Very ancient Polynesian,” he assured
us. Layer after layer of tapa cloth was
displayed as well as clubs, bowls and
statues carved from island timbers. In
the next room we were introduced to
their paintings.
“M. Jacquinot, our Ministre d’Outre
Mer, has awarded Aloi a scholarship.
He will be going to study in Paris.”
Aloi Pilioko smiled when we hoped he
wouldn’t find Paris too noisy. He ex-
plained that he enjoyed our traffic. So
different from life on his island. He was
certain that Paris would be no worse.
Michoutouchkine showed us his own
work, riots of color depicting island
activity. He held up another painting
proudly. “D’you recognise it? The
Storey Bridge. I had an exhibition there
some time ago. Lady Casey sponsored
me. I like Brisbane. Sydney is too
noisy. But best of all I like the islands.
It is my life and so rich in paintings.
See this shirt?”
He fingered the hem of a colorful
garment. “An abstractist in Tahiti
painted it for me. I have shown work
from the islands in India,
Ceylon, Burma and Nepal.
I was the first foreign
artist to exhibit in Nepal.
The artifacts and Aloi’s
work are only for ex-
hibition Mine are for
sale.”
In llie Swim
Frank O’Neill went into the
" swimming-pool business in 1957, he
built 30 pools in his first year. Now
with teams at work in all States he is
completing two a day; and the boom,
he says, has hardly started. In a few
weeks he will open an exhibition centre
with three demonstration pools at the
Sydney suburb of Pymble. This centre,
just across the road from his swimming
school, will enable inquirers to see how
the finished products look without having
to be taken to the homes of owners.
At his swimming school last week,
O'Neill came out of the water after a
teaching session to talk to us about the
pool business. Still a young man, he
has the big physique, the deep tan and
the strangely aqueous look that swimmers
often get. His manner suggests the
modest athlete rather than the business-
man. He told us he had thought of the
twin ideas of setting up a swimming
school and building pools for others
when his own career as a swimmer was
ending with the 1952 Olympic Games.
O’Neill said that his breakthrough
year was 1960, when he adopted the
technique of spraying concrete under
pressure instead of pouring it. This way
an entire job of any shape can be con-
creted in four hours. It has cut costs
so much that today a pool measuring

30 feet by 15 feet is down to about the
price of a Holden.
New South Wales is the most pool-
conscious State, he finds, with Western
Australia and Queensland not far behind.
Irregular shapes are in; rectangles are
out. Most buyers are home-owners, but
many pools are also built for schools,
hospitals, motels and home-unit blocks.
The industry’s problem is simply to keep
up with demand.
Prowess
'l7'ictoria’s Royal Commission into
* liquor has produced some fascin-
ating figures. For example, West Aus-
tralians stand out as Australia’s most
splendid drinkers. They spend 7.3 per
cent of their income on alcoholic drinks.
Victorians spend 5.9, New South Welsh-
men 7.0, Queenslanders 6.6, South Aus-
tralians 6.3, Tasmanians 6.5.
Tasmanians are the heaviest smokers.
They spend 3.8 per cent, then come
NSW and Queenslanders with 3.6. All
the rest are 3.5. The best readers of
newspapers and books are Tasmanians
and Victorians with 1.9, then NSW and
Queenslanders with 1.8. Then we go
down the scale to South Australians
with 1.3.
Victoria is the only State that drinks
more beer in bottles and cans than in
bulk. On the other hand we have NSW
which drinks 74.6 per cent bulk beer
and a mere 25.4 per cent in cans and
bottles. Whereas Victoria drinks 52.7
per cent in cans and bottles and only
47.3 in bulk. The nearest to Victoria
is South Australia which drinks 47.6 in
bottles and cans. So, you see, if the
temperance societies are worried over
the amount of beer Victorians are drink-
ing in pubs they’re getting even more at
home.
Families Afloat
HPhe oldest boat in a fleet of hire
cruisers owned by Halvorsen
Brothers, of Sydney, was wrecked in
Broken Bay at the Australia Day
weekend. Four members of a family
who had set out for a holiday on the
Hawkesbury River became seasick and
panicky when they missed the river
entrance, and drove the boat ashore
through the surf at Pearl Beach, where
it was soon a total loss.
For the Halvorsens this was only the
second such wreck in 17 years’ oper-
ating, despite the fact that their hirers,
who now number thousands, are not
required to hav<= had any previous ex-
perience. Most people who rent the
cruisers are really boat-owners at heart,
the Halvorsens feel. They like to do
things in a seaman-like manner; they
even get up in the morning and scrub
down the decks. Many of them are
families who go out year after year, and
many are holidaymakers from other
States, particularly Victoria. The best
proof of their carefulness and of the
Halvorsens’ good maintenance is that
insurance premiums on boats of the hire
fleet are lower than those paid by private
owners.
Three of the five Norwegian - born
Halvorsen brothers, sons of Lars Hal-
vorsen and all well known in boat-build-
ing and yachting circles, are at present
engaged in the business. They had a
foretaste of it in 1939 with a boat that
they hired out for weekends on Sydney
Harbor, but made their effective start
in 1946 at Bobbin Head in Kuringai
Chase, which gives access to the extensive
sheltered cruising grounds of Cowan
Creek, Pittwater and the Hawkesbury.
The fleet now comprises 52 well-
appointed boats of from 25 to 36 feet.
The Halvorsens say that in summer they
could use many more. For the Christ-
mas holidays they are always booked out
12 months ahead.

Defence Crises
TT has been a black month for
A Australia’s defence services.
Dominating everything is the “Voy-
ager” tragedy, but there have also
been Army and Air Force troubles,
in particular the disturbing increase
in the number of attempted resig-
nations by officers because of ser-
vice conditions and the inquiry into
similar complaints made by a
senior officer about the RAAF
(see page 7 this issue).
To these symptoms of discon-
tent must be added the publicity
given to the bad organisation of,
and inadequate investment in, our
defence at the recent Summer
School of the Australian Institute
of Political Science one of the
most important public conferences
held in Australia for many years.
First Dr Brian Beddie pointed, at
the organisational level, to the ab-
sence of effective Cabinet control,
the absence of clear lines of Mini-
sterial responsibility, the serious
divergencies between defence, eco-
nomic and diplomatic policies, and
the actual decline in defence in-
vestment in the 1950 s while we
tried, as it were, to substitute words
for swords, with fatal consequences
to our West New Guinea policy.
Dealing with our state of pre-
paredness, Dr T. B. Millar was
equally alarming. (See his paper
beginning on page 13 of this issue.)
According to Millar, our troops
would not be ready when needed in
the event of a war and in any case
are being trained for the sorts of
situation they are unlikely to meet.
The Air Force has inadequate capa-
city for long-range transport, for
delivery of conventional bombs, for
reconnaissance and anti-submarine
action, and for radar warnings. The
Navy (without reference to the loss
of “Voyager”) is inadequate to pro-
tect our shipping routes or convoys,
its anti-aircraft potential is slight,
and it needs more bases.
In a Press conference last week
the new Minister, Dr A. J. Forbes,
described Dr Millar’s paper as
“interesting” and said some of his
points would be “closely looked
at”. One assumes that this “close
look” will be followed by quick re-
formative action. One of Dr Bed-
die’s points was that often the Gov-
ernment has known what should be
done but has been restrained by a
hostile public opinion which was
unwilling to pay for proper defence.
This was a fair point in its time, but
it is no longer true. The public is
now defence-minded and there
could not be a better time for ac-
tion, provided the Government, for
once, takes the public into its con-
fidence and explains what it is
doing and why.
The Bangkok Talks
THE Bangkok talks have shown,
whatever else, that anyone who
thinks that Indonesia has abandon-
ed “Crush Malaysia” as cardinal
policy of state is deluding himself.
Confrontation is still very much on.
However, the Indonesians, who are
quite good at deluding themselves
in their turn they do it with a
zest, charm and self-conviction un-
matched by any other peoples in
the world have to live with hard
facts too. One of them is that
Malaysia is steadily emerging in
the present dispute as a country and
an entity. For a nation contrived
out of small numbers and re-
sources and from large racial and
cultural tensions this is no mean
feat and it is happening. Even
the fact that at the Conference both
the Filipinos and the Indonesians
have been obliged to use the word
“Malaysia”, however reluctantly, is
significant of changes in status. The
chief advantage of the Bangkok
Conference was not that it got very
far although it got somewhere
—over the matter of guerrillas in
Sarawak and so on, but that the
dispute is out in the open and be-
fore the gaze of the world. The
other gain seems to be that the
cease-fire has heralded Indonesia’s
return to Djakarta’s favorite game
of diplomatic and political pressure.
It is becoming increasingly apparent
that a country where 300,000
people are officially admitted to
be starving simply cannot mount a
full-scale attack on the Borneo Ter-
ritories even if it wanted to. Even
the current offensive more an
exercise in political subversion than
a military campaign is a severe
enough strain on dwindling Indo-
nesian resources. A return to talk-
ing and verbal manoeuvring is
much better suited to Indonesian
capacity at this stage. Barring the
misfortune of accidental war there
is more room for optimism about
Malaysia’s survival than at any time
since the low-water mark of Bobby
Kennedy’s visit.
Lolita
IAR R. F. BRISSENDEN, senior
lecturer in English in Canberra,
deserves congratulations for having
set the banned novel “Lolita” as a
text for his students. One looks to
University English Departments to
take a stand on literary censorship,
and Dr Brissenden has taken the
lead in this case, maintaining the
fine tradition illustrated in the early
1940 s when the Sydney University
English Department set the then
banned “Ulysses” as the subject
for a prize essay. The only possible
criticism one might make is that
Dr Brissenden seems to be giving
the book too much literary import-
ance, but that is a matter for his
judgment, and the banning of
“Lolita” still remains one of the
stupidest censorship decisions in
the world. Let us hope that Dr
Brissenden’s move will have the
same effect as the Sydney move
over “Ulysses” had 20 years ago
and lead to the lifting of the ban.


THIS AUSTRALIA
RAN
The Voyager Puzzle
Waiting for answers
FROM A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
SIR JOHN SPICER
Questions
VTPhe same question is on everyone’s lips
and in every newspaper, and no one
is patient enough to defer speculation
until the answer has been provided by
Mr Justice Spicer’s Royal Commission.
How was it possible for two ships, each
of which was equipped with radar, to
collide? Each ship had a radar set on the
bridge and another in the operations
room. One would think that in a night
exercise these sets would be constantly
consulted—however true it may be that
radar can be misleading and that it is a
mistake to rely too much on it.
In any case the ships were presumably
not without lights. Each should have
had a white light on the masthead and
navigation lights port and starboard.
Melbourne also would have had dim
landing lights on her deck for the benefit
of its aircraft, but these would not have
been visible from Voyager, far below,
The diagrams below (left) show one
theory about the manner in which the
disaster took place. Voyager’s task was
to keep astern and somewhat to port
of Melbourne, who had reversed her
course. Did her captain think that Mel-
bourne had gone through, and that he
was turning astern of her? Or did he
underestimate the speed at which she
was moving and think that he could
reach his position by sailing diagonally
across her path? According to reports
Mel bourne was moving at over 20 knots,
At that speed 20,000 tons of ship are
very difficult to manoeuvre. With engines
full astern she could not be brought to a
standstill in less than half a mile. Nor
could she easily turn aside. [ln actual
fact Melbourne did stop in her own
length after collision with Voyager
largely due to the tremendous resistance
Voyager must have offered, hit broad-
side on and pushed sideways against the
sea.] For example, her course after the
order is given “Hard aport” resembles
the letter q. A destroyer by contrast
can manoeuvre very readily. Did Mel-
bourne rely on that fact? Did she
assume that Voyager was aware of her
course until it was too late to avoid a
collision?
If Melbourne had made a signal that
she was flying aircraft she would have
the right of way. Otherwise she would
give way to a ship on her starboard
bow —if indeed she had time to do so.
On the face of it, it is much easier to
explain the behavior of Melbourne than
that of Voyager, but more than that one
cannot say until the facts are established.
One thing is clear at this stage. The
incident shows, as to a lesser extent did
that of the drowned midshipmen also,
the immense personal responsibilities that
are borne by the captain of a ship. It
is hard to think of comparable responsi-
bilities in either of the other Services in
peacetime.
There will be many questions to
answer when the Inquiry opens.

RAAF
An Armed Services
Trade Union?
No court-martial for the critical Group-Captain
FROM RICHARD HALL IN SYDNEY
Viscount De L’Isle, VC
Unhappy
the top administrative body of
'' the Royal Australian Air Force —
the Air Board —sat down to one of its
regular meetings early this month it had
a most unusual problem, innocuously
listed on its agenda under the heading
of “general business.” The question up
for decision was what action, if any,
should be taken against a Group-Captain,
who in a private paper had outspokenly,
indeed bitterly, criticised the present
pension scheme for the Services, known
as the DFRB —the Defence Forces Re-
tirement Benefit scheme.
Despite rumors that the Group-
Captain would face a court-martial, the
Air Board, after considering the report
of a Court of Inquiry, decided against
this. But the whole affair was another
symptom of the discontent among
officers in all the Armed Services.
The Group-Captain, a World War II
veteran, normally a mild-mannered man,
now at Canberra, is said to have origin-
ally prepared the paper for circulation
among a small group of friends as a basis
for discussion before the last election,
but since then hundreds of copies have
been run off and circulated —to his
embarrassment.
The paper started off bluntly: “The
DFRB scheme in its present form is a
dictatorial confidence trick being per-
petrated on the Armed Forces of Aus-
tralia. Even a cursory examination of
the conditions reveals aspects which
suggests a ruthless and cynical disregard
for the rights of contributors.” The
Group-Captain then continued his indict-
ment for seven single-spaced typing
foolscap pages. He was bitterly critical
of the Public Servants involved in the
administration of the scheme, who, he
claimed, would block any attempts at
reforming it. While the three Services
are represented on various committees
and boards involved in the scheme, they
lacked the financial and actuarial ex-
perience to be able to stand up on
policy to the Public Servants.
The Reserve Fund of the DFRB now
stands at about £20,000,000. There are
about 42,500 contributing members and
4,400 surviving pensioners from the three
Services. What the Group-Captain and
other officers have complained about is
that current inadequate pensions are
being met out of the fund contributions
and that the Government has never been
made to make its contribution. They
argue that the scheme should be like
any other superannuation fund and that
the employer’s contribution should go
in at the time of the employee’s pay-
ment to build up the strength of the
fund and allow an appreciation of re-
serves which would meet changes in
the cost of living.
But such a proposal would mean the
beginning of a complete overhaul of the
scheme at present in operation. As the
Group-Captain put it: “All right, you
must now realise we are being robbed;
so what are we going to do about it?”
He suggested that a “joint service mass
protest ‘would be’ more likely to achieve
corrective results than isolated attempts.”
Furthermore, a fund might have to be
arranged to obtain the service of a
solicitor specialising in constitutional
law and an accountant with insurance
training. What the Group-Captain was
doing, and what must have been obvious
to those who ordered the Court of
Inquiry, was coming pretty close to
Service trade-unionism.
TTe came nearer to carrying his argu-
-*-A ment to the logical conclusion when
he spoke of the need for officers to
join the Regular Defence Forces
Welfare Association. The Association is
at present run by retired officers and
regards itself as being concerned with
such issues as individual hardship cases.
The Air Board has avoided the drastic
course of a court-martial which would
have brought the whole affair into the
open, but the case has given Services’
discontent over pensions a new impetus.
There have been rumors throughout the
Army in the last few weeks that the
Prime Minister will make a statement
on moves regarding Services’ conditions
within the next few months. This is
taken to mean that he will announce
the Cabinet decision on a proposal from
the Defence Department for the appoint-
ment of an arbitrator.
The arbitrator proposal is important
as a key to a series of events early last
month when the Prime Minister, Sir
Robert Menzies, and the Minister for
the Army, Dr A. J. Forbes, went to
Yarralumla together with the CGS, Lt.-
Gen. Sir J. G. N. Wilton. The CGS
had been recalled from his holidays for
the meeting and flown by an Army light
plane from Bateman’s Bay to Canberra.
The secretary to the Department of the
Army was also present. For some months
prior to this, rumors had circulated that
the Governor-General, Viscount De
L’lsle, was unhappy about the spate of
Army resignations and applications for
redress of wrongs that he had received.
The constitutional position of the
Governor-General in the matter is clear.
If his advisers tell him the resignations
must be rejected, then he must reject.
But Viscount De L’lsle, himself an ex-
officer and VC, is said to have
approached the Prime Minister and
spoken of his misgivings. If this is true,
it does something to account for the
presence of the Prime Minister at the
Yarralumla meeting, which in the light
of the CGS’s flight back from his
holidays does not appear to have been
a social call.
What is said is that the Governor-
General was given an assurance that
the proposed appointment of an arbitra-
tor would mean a full investigation of
the causes of dissatisfaction. Next week’s
“Commonwealth Gazette” carried the
formal rejection of six officers’ resigna-
tions, some of which had been delayed
for longer than six months. Ironically
enough on the next page the “Gazette”
carried the acceptance of three RAAF
officers’ resignations.
Those Army officers involved in the
legal battle for the right to resign are
frightened that the appointment of the
arbitrator will do something to obscure
what they regard as a matter of principle
—the right to resign. It is claimed that
the Commonwealth Government has
been adopting delaying tactics to stop
the legal action coming on before amend-
ing legislation to the Defence Act can
be put through to make the Govern-
ment’s right to reject resignations water-
tight.
When the Minister for the Army, Dr
Forbes, came to Sydney to hold an
impressively suave Press conference last
week he neatly walked around the
possibility of such an amendment to
Section 17 (1) of the Defence Act, saying
that it wouldn’t be proper to comment
with the court case pending. However,
when further questioned on whether any
such amendment would be brought down
before the court case came on he smiled
wryly and answered, “Oh no, we’re not
quite that bad”.


NSW
Seats with Three Corners
“Teaching Liberals the hard way”?
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
A. G. ENTICKNAP
In danger
YI/'hile the NSW Labor Party is trying
” to talk its 73-years-old leader,
Robert Heffron, into resigning before
the next State elections (which cannot be
more than a year away) the Opposition
Liberal and Country parties are also
heating up perennial coalition ten-
sions. When the Chairman of the NSW
Country Party, Mr J. B. Fuller, said
recently that his party might have to
convince the Liberals “the hard way”
that their intervention in rural seats
would not put a “non-socialist” govern-
ment into power, he was not merely
reiterating his party’s long-standing op-
position to Liberal candidates in country
electorates, because he went out of his
way to go further and accuse the Liberal
Party of neglecting its job in the city
seats: “In New South Wales,” he said,
“even if the Liberals won every Country
seat they would not become the govern-
ment.”
The Liberal Party response is simply
that the Country Party has had its chance
to win back seats from Labor in the
country and has failed; and that three-
cornered contests usually increase the
non-Labor vote. To back their case,
newspaper cuttings from Tasmania are
being circulated which, describing at-
tempts to get the fledgling Country Party
under way there, and quoting Country
Party leaders like J. Dredge of NSW and
Federal Secretary, and even Mr McEwen,
as favoring three-cornered contests!
Much of the Liberal confidence and
Country Party fears stem from the
growth of country towns. The Liberal
argument goes, and the figures back it,
that town voters will often prefer to vote
Labor rather than give their vote to the
Country Party, but that they will wel-
come a Liberal alternative.
Only two of the Labor-held country
seats, Murrumbidgee (held by the
Minister for Agriculture, A. G. Entick-
nap, an ageing, one-legged World War I
veteran) and Mudgee (held by Leo Nott)
were the subject of three-cornered con-
tests last time. In Murrumbidgee Entick-
nap scraped in by a few votes, after the
distribution of DLP preferences. The
Liberal candidate polled about 1,000
more than his Country Party rival. In
Mudgee, Leo Nott held on narrowly.
The Liberals expect to win both these
seats next time, in a better climate than
the 1962 elections when the credit
squeeze and unemployment were factors
in building up a 14-seat Labor majority
in the Legislative Assembly.
The Liberals are also talking about
going after other Labor-held but tradi-
tionally Country Party seats Castle-
reagh (held by the Deputy Premier, J. B.
Renshaw) and Lismore now held by the
Minister for Lands, Mr K. C. Compton,
who slipped in between two rival Coun-
try Party candidates in a 1959 by-elec-
tion). There are also tentative Liberal
plans for Burrinjuck (held by Mr Billy
Sheahan the State’s Health Minister, who
once boasted that he had 2,000 relatives
in the electorate).
In retaliation, the Country Party is
going into Albury where the 77-year-old
sitting Liberal member, Dudley Padman,
announced his retirement this month.
There has been no talk of a Country
Party candidate for Goulburn, where
a weak, local Labor member, Mr L.
Tully, has hung on since succeeding his
father. Every time Goulburn is regarded
as one of the Liberal hopes, and cer-
tainly if the Opposition are to come to
government they will have to win it.
The area has never been Country Party
territory.
To form a government the coalition
parties need to win eight seats from
Labor. If Liberal hopes in Murrum-
bidgee and Mudgee pay off. they will
have two of the target. Goulburn would
be the next country hope. On Federal
figures from the last election, Lismore
should be lost by Labor, but, in the
smaller-size State electorates, personal
factors loom larger and Compton is a
competent member who has also dis-
pensed plenty of ministerial patronage
in his electorate.
But naming only those four seats as
hopes (and one of them, the last, tenuous)
makes it clear that the Liberal Party
has to pick up a few urban seats too.
There, its best chances, on the Federal
figures, are Bligh, Coogee and Nepean.
The first two are mixed-class Sydney
Eastern Suburbs seats. In both of them
rents were the big issue last time when
the Liberal Party dirtied its nose political-
ly by proposing rent control reforms to
help landlords. If the Liberal Party lies
low on rents this time, they may pick up
these seats as part of a general swing,
even though both sitting members culti-
vate their electorates well. In Nepean
local government issues and a weak
Labor member give the Liberals a good
chance.
THE CONVICTS
ffiJ&ulletCn
80 Years Ago: February 23, 1884
Thus a lying contributor to
VANITY FAIR (London):— “In-
dividuals in any Australian Legislature
having the convict taint in these
colonies were and are of the pro-
nounced among the small section of
disloyalists which certain gentlemen
have managed to separate from the
respectable majority of English,
Scotch, and Irish-born colonists.”
Now the truthful statement is that
the only individual in any Australian
Legislature having, so far as is known,
actually the convict taint is an ultra-
loyal Queensland senator and Mayor;
while, as for those of the wealthy
lower orders in Australia, whose
immediate forbears were convicts,
they are almost to a man the most
intensely pronounced Jingos in the
continent.
A T the Wesleyan Conference re-
cently held in Melbourne, during
the discussion anent the Bible in State
Schools, Mr Leaver, MLC, stated that
it would be impossible for the teachers
to impart Christian instruction in the
Public schools since he knew of
many who had no belief whatever
in Christian doctrine. This statement
drew forth from several holy men
the bigot shriek: “They have no right
in the schools, then.” Of course it
is useless to ask such narrow-minded
idiots what connection can exist
betwixt arithmetic and scriptural ter-
meneutics, or why a clever Brahmin
should not be able to teach analysis
as well as a stupid Wesleyan.

BROKEN HILL
NSW’s Berlin Wall
Isolated from free Australia
J. J. MALONEY
“Send Manuel”
FROM BOB BOTTOM IN BROKEN HILL
TJroken Hill, though somewhat used
to unorthodox union strife, will
take a long time to fully recover from
the shaking up it has received in recent
months by industrial upheaval.
The city was thrown into turmoil in
December, when the Barrier Industrial
Council adopted its favorite boycott
weapon in a bid to force firms to give
an equitable share of their advertising
to its daily newspaper, “Barrier Daily
Truth”.
That row reached its zenith on Friday,
December 13, now known as “Black
Friday” locally, when all but a handful
of local shopkeepers “shut shop” in
retaliation against a BIC ban on Wool-
worths Ltd’s lqcal variety store because
it did not give as much advertising to
“Truth” as it did to the Murdoch-owned
paper, the “Barrier Miner”.
The BIC reasoned that if Woolworths
did not do business with “Truth”, the
8000 unionists who, being affiliated with
the BIC, were owners of the “Truth”,
would not deal from Woolworths.
Traders reacted angrily, labelling the
BlC’s action as conscriptive and the
“Barrier Miner” declared it was “just
another layer of bricks in the Berlin
Wall the BIC is trying to build between
Broken Hill and free Australia.”
Thus the city was split in one of its
bitterest issues. You were either with
the BIC or against it. Broken Hill being
such a Labor-minded community, the
majority eventually sided with the BIC.
Despite disquiet elsewhere about its
action, the BIC stood firm and, in an
eventual peace settlement, recognised
the right of firms to advertise at their
own discretion, but maintained the right
to deal with what it termed “discrimina-
ting firms.”
Since, Woolworths Ltd is advertising
more with the “Truth” and advertise-
ments of other firms, which have fallen
into line, appear daily in the paper as
stark evidence of the power of the BIC.
The bitterness that lingered after that
row accentuated the schemozzle which
has given this mining city an even worse
jolt in recent weeks, as the BIC pressed
union claims for four weeks’ annual
leave for 2500 employees of shops,
garages, hotels and other businesses.
All hell broke loose when the BIC
began blacklisting hotels and shops to
force members of the Chamber of
Commerce to grant the extra week’s
leave, which previously had been re-
commended by the President of the NSW
Industrial Commission, Mr Justice
Taylor.
As the BIC implemented its pro-
gramme of industrial action, aimed at
“splitting” the Chamber, a dozen or so
businesses quickly agreed to pay the
claim. After 25 of the city’s 37 hotels had
been declared “out of bounds” to
unionists for two days, 18 drapery shops
for one day and ten of the biggest
general stores another day, 12 hotels
and 18 other business establishments
had gone with the BIC.
Other traders reacted by issuing seven
days’ notice to their staff when the BIC
failed to heed its demand that it call
off its bans.
At the point when the dispute
reached this stage, the NSW Minister
for Labor, Mr J. Maloney, stepped in
and sent Conciliation Commissioner Mr
G. S. Manuel, a former secretary of the
BIC, to Broken Hill in an effort to get
the parties to settle the dispute.
Although it is confidently expected
that Commissioner Manuel will give a
decision acceptable to both parties, it
is not likely to mark the end of in-
dustrial trouble in Broken Hill. For the
unions now are preparing to tackle the
mining companies to obtain an extra
week’s leave and other concessions for
mineworkers, which the companies so
far have showed no signs of granting.
On top of that, the most outward
scar of recent battles is personal bitter-
ness, and people on both sides of the
fence are likely to jump at the first
chance to have another go at each other.
In the background, the Communists, who
are infiltrating the unions as never before,
are not missing an opportunity to inflame
whatever dispute arises.
LITERATURE
The League of Decency
Support from Cincinnati, Ohio
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
T ast year Mr E. L. Dearn, a 36-year-
old Sydney solicitor, wrote an article
in a church paper about lewd literature.
As a result he received “an avalanche
of letters requesting action against in-
decent literature, pornographic and
obscene magazines and over-emphasis on
sex in photography and advertising.” So,
in October, the League of National
Welfare and Decency was formed.
Today it claims a membership of
200,000, although almost the only
publicity it has received has been in
the Sydney Catholic magazine “Vision”
in such articles as “Sex is Your Business”.
Last week about 30 League members
attended a meeting in Sydney to map
out its plan of action. After the screen-
ing of an American film about a teen-
age rape-murder correspondence with
official and private bodies in Australia
and overseas was tabled. This mainly
comprised enthusiastic replies to the
League’s own letters to the “Citizens
for Decent Literature Inc.” of Cincin-
nati, Ohio, local church bodies, the
Aboriginal Inland Mission (the League
“is certainly something that is urgently
needed”), the RSL (“takes this opportu-
nity to congratulate your League”), the
Federation of Parents and Citizens’
Associations, NSW Railways, the Police
and the NSW Chief Secretary’s Depart-
ment, etc.
But what of its actual plans? “We
are not a bunch of wowsers,” League
President Dearn said in an interview.
“But we are genuinely concerned about
the increasing flood of pornographic
literature in Australia, which is con-
tributing to the rise in such sex crimes
as rape and endangering the future of
Australia’s youth”. (At one League meet-
ing one man said that if his children
are five minutes late from school, his
wife is on the phone to him, and others
complained of wholesale gang rapes.)
To support this concern, the League has
researched widely and its references
range from Edgar J. Hoover (“There
has not been a sex murder in the history
of our department in which the killer
was not an avid reader of lewd
magazines”) to the “Sutherland Shire
Leader” (“Barnyard behavior is no
longer reserved to the darkness of the
night”).
To back his words, Mr Dearn pro-
duced a weighty collection of “girlie
magazines”. On the glossy pages of


“Pleasure”, “Light and Shade”, “Cava-
lier”, “Figure” and countless others
locally produced and imported “girlie”
publications, pretty, buxom girls undress,
parade in scanty underwear, recline and
stand nude in tempting poses. In between
there are occasional good portrait shots,
artistic photographs, black and white
jokes. They sell for as much as 12s. each.
What the League can actually do
about all this is still unclear. Meanwhile
it is continuing to collect and examine
lewd magazines, to call the Police’s
attention to the worst cases, to co-operate
with similar bodies throughout the Com-
monwealth and overseas. International
co-operation is essential, it believes,
because “where obscene literature is
kicked out of one country it endeavors
to export elsewhere.”
THE ECONOMY
The Spree
Funk money from Britain.
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN BRITAIN
"CVidence poured in this week of the
fast-rising yeast in the economy,
capped by the startling news that retail
spending rose by nearly 8 per cent last
December, compared with the same
month in 1962, by far the sharpest
monthly rise last year.
What made the news the more signi-
ficant was that new motor vehicle regis-
trations, which usually dip in December,
rose substantially in November and were
20 per cent higher than in December,
1962. Whereas the Economic Survey last
July looked to other retail spending to
take up any slack in spending on motors,
it is now obvious that spending is buoy-
ant on both fronts.
It is too early yet for the authorities
to worry about a spending spree on the
scale of 1960, but this year the signs of
a bumper spending spree are there.
This is r.o cause for gloom, of course,
but only for the authorities to be wary
lest prices start rising under the weight
of fresh income being injected into the
system from all major sources of income
generation, not excluding the Federal
Government (which is in the process of
spending nearly £2OO million more this
financial year than last) and portfolio
investment from investors in Britain
(w'hence funk money in front of a pos-
sible Labor victory in that country has
been flooding in to our share markets).
With wool prices still rising, export
income alone looks like topping last
year's record £1,069 million by as much
as £3OO million and capital is flowing in
at something like £3OO million a year.
To date the Reserve Bank has called in
only £72 million this year to offset the
effect of these tidal waves.
PASSPORTS
Visas
The Thornleigh “Peace”
Conference
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
T ast week Mr E. L. (“Ted”) Wheel-
JL * wright, DEC, MA, lecturer in Eco-
nomics, pundit, TV personality, was re-
ported to have been refused a visa to
visit the United States. He was not
refused. But the Sydney office did decide
to refer the application to the appropriate
authorities in the USA. It further ap-
pears the visa would have been granted,
but, being in a hurry, Mr Wheelwright
did not pursue the matter.
The trouble seems to have been Mr
Wheelwright's participation in a lead-
ing role in a “Peace” Conference held
at Thornleigh, Sydney, on June 14/16,
1963, which passed resolutions in direct
agreement with major points of Soviet
and Chinese foreign policy and opposed
outright the Exmouth Gulf Radio Com-
munications Base and US policy in
general.
Mr Wheelwright is not known to have
disassociated himself from any of this.
In the circumstances, American officials
here were under an obligation to act as
they did.
Mr Wheelwright is not the first public
figure to be involved in so-called “Peace”
meetings. A recent pamphlet published
by the Melbourne quarterly “Dissent”,
called “The Melbourne Peace Move-
ment,” deals at length with the tech-
nique of getting leading public figures,
authors, clergymen, educationalists, etc.
to lend respectability to meetings which
turn out to be blatant Communist
“fronts”. Written by Mr. Harold Crouch,
the pamphlet should be compulsory read-
ing for all those people invited to lend
their names and reputations to such
meetings.
EDUCATION
Identity Cards
To stop cheating?
FROM A BRISBANE CORRESPONDENT
Queensland University’s shock-haired
authoritarian Vice-Chancellor, Sir
Fred Schonell, last week issued an order
that while on University premises all
students must carry an identification card
bearing their photograph. But the Uni-
versity Law Students’ Society has spear-
headed a strong move against it and
decided to ask its members to refrain
from being photographed until after the
Faculty meets on March 13. University
Union president (Mr Barry Murphy)
said his understanding was that the photo-
graphs were an added step to preventing
cheating at examinations and stealing of
books from the University library; he
disagreed with a statement by Sir Fred
that the photographs were being intro-
duced so that University staff could get
to know their students better. Sir Fred,
in reply, said that the National Union
of Australian -University Students had
accepted the principle of identification
cards.
UNIONS
Miscellaneous
Purging the Leftists
From Peter Coleman in Sydney
HPhe post-election anti-Leftist move in
the NSW Labor Party is slowly get-
ting under way. The first serious chal-
lenge to the Leftist leadership of Aus-
tralia’s fifth largest union—the Miscel-
laneous Workers’ Union—will be made
at next week’s annual general meetings
of the NSW Branch (February 25). The
union has over 50,000 members (22,000
of them in the NSW Branch), covers 31
industries and is, therefore, the only seri-
ous rival to the Right-wing Australian
Workers’ Union in its range of eligible
members.
The NSW Branch Executive, under
General Secretary Mr Ray Gietzelt,
came to power in the union after the
Labor split in 1955, and since then has
consistently followed a militant Left-wing
line in Labor politics.
The challenge to the Executive at next
week’s meeting comes from a dismissed
organiser of the union, Mr V. Ariansen,
who has moved that the union’s rules be
amended to make any recent member
of the Communist Party ineligible for
election to office in the union (which, if
carried, could eliminate several of its
officers) and to commit the union to
opposition to the Communist Party.
When calling the Annual General
Meeting, however, the State Council of
the union broke with traditional practice
and did not outline the substance of these
resolutions in the agenda list. Most
members, therefore, may not know the
significance of the coming meetings and
may not bother to attend, thereby miss-
ing their rare chance to strike at the
Leftist Executive. To counter this devel-
opment, the mover of the resolutions,
Ariansen, has circulated members giving
them the information.
If sufficient members do attend and
the motions are carried, this could be
one of the most damaging blows the
Leftists have suffered in NSW for years.

The Defence Crisis
“Covenants without swords are hut words ”
By T. B. MILLAR
Since our great and powerful Ameri-
can ally and our somewhat less
powerful but still very important
British friend are not inevitably com-
mitted to the defence of our continent
and people and way of life, the security
of Australia is primarily and ultimately
the responsibility of Australians.
No one will question the right and
need of Australia to have defence forces
of some kind. The questions are—what
kind? how many? and how should they
be armed, equipped and organised? In
what situations should we be ready—
or may we be forced —to commit them?
Let us begin with the last aspect, for
the situation will determine the size and
nature of the forces required.
Let me, as a layman, put bluntly the
questions that are at the heart of our
somewhat obscure commitments to
SEATO and Malaysia. Why should we
send Australian servicemen—our sons,
our brothers, ourselves—to fight and
perhaps die in South Vietnam, in
Thailand, in Malaya, in northern Borneo,
or in the waters adjoining them? Why
should we attempt, by force if necessary,
to prevent the assimilation of eastern
New Guinea into Indonesia?
In assessing the threats to our country,
I have made a number of assump-
tions about the intentions and capacities
of our near and not so near neighbors:
(a) That the Chinese Peoples’ Re-
public, with its standing army of some
3 million men, has supported and will
support subversion, revolution, and even
overt invasion throughout South-East
Asia in an attempt to ensure that the
region is controlled by Communist
governments sympathetic or preferably
T'his is an abridged version of a
paper delivered at the Australian
Institute of Political Science 1964
Summer School in Canberra. It is
one of five delivered at the School
which will be collected into a book
and published by the Institute in April
and which will make an important
contribution to the study of Austra-
lia’s defence problems.
Dr Millar graduated from Dun-
troon in 1944, served with the AIF
in Morotai and later with BCOF in
Japan. A fter the war Dr Millar resign-
ed from the Army and took his MA
degree in International Relations at
Melbourne University and later his
Ph.D in the same subject at London
University. He is now a Research
Fellow in International Relations at
the Australian National University.
subordinate to China; and that if China
. . .
were to gain control of the mainland,
A . , , , .
Australia would be in a very difficult
„ .... t-, .... / , f
position. Ihus in helping to defend
5 _ t-, •, S ° , A/r , ■
South Vietnam, lhailand, and Malaysia,
Australia contributes directly to its own
defence.
(b) That the United States will
continue for the foreseeable future to
attempt to contain Communist expan-
sionism in South-East Asia.
(c) That Indonesia, with its army of
some 300,000 men, its Russian and
American equipment, means what it says
about being determined to crush Malay-
sia; that it will continue to direct border
skirmishes and raids, infiltrate subversives
and stimulate insurrection in northern
Borneo, the Malayan peninsula, and pro-
bably Timor, as well as carrying out
minor naval actions in the area; that it
may well do these things in eastern New
Guinea; that these situations could “esca-
late'’ into more serious conflict.
(d) That although neither China nor
Indonesia is at present capable—even if
it were desirous —of launching an attack
against our mainland, either could
become capable of doing so within a
few years.
As for commitments Australia is
obliged to defend eastern New Guinea
so long as it is in our charge and
trust; the area is also strategically
important to us. By a unilateral state-
ment, we have committed ourselves “in
the circumstances that now exist” to
the defence, against aggression or sub-
version, of the Malaysian States, in-
cluding the two in Borneo. Under
SEATO, in return for a degree of pro-
tection, we have committed ourselves
in general terms to the defence of

Pakistan (though not against India), of
Thailand, of South Vietnam, the
Philippines and New Zealand. Under
ANZUS we have committed ourselves
in certain circumstances to military
action in conjunction with the United
States and New Zealand in the Pacific.
As to causes meaningful to us:—we
are not and cannot be oblivious to the
general cause of peace and to the extent
of human freedom and welfare. The
death or diminishing of liberties of any
nation diminishes Australia. No country,
if I may vary John Donne, is an island.
To a degree, our national ideals and
attitudes are manifested in our member-
ship of the Commonwealth and in our
joining with other Western nations to
help prevent the spread of Communism.
We confront nobody. We desire to
attack nobody. We are in a position to
attack nobody. When we increase our
defences, or help to defend Malaysia
or Thailand, we are not, as is sometimes
suggested, inviting or inciting attacks.
It is not strength which invites attack,
but weakness.
Here, then, are the situations in which
we may be called upon to commit our
armed forces within the next five to
ten years: (1) to defend eastern New
Guinea from Indonesian invasion or
Indonesian-inspired subversion; (2) to
help defend, in conjunction with Malay-
sian, British and perhaps New Zealand
forces, Sabah and Sarawak from Indo-
nesian invasion or Indonesian-inspired
subversion and to help in the naval
defence of Malaysia; (3) to help defend,
in conjunction with the United States and
such other SEATO powers as will assist,
Thailand from Communist invasion or
externally-inspired Communist subver-
sion; (4) to help defend, in conjunction
with the United States and perhaps other
SEATO powers, South Vietnam from
externally backed Communist sub-
version, infiltration, terrorism and aggres-
sion; (5) to defend our own continent
against Indonesian attacks, or Indo-
nesian-based Chinese Communist attacks.
Finally, there is the matter of Aus-
tralia’s role in the event of a major
East-West war.
New Guinea
t\)R Australia to make a concurrent
substantial effort in all four areas
would require a defence programme and
expenditure many times greater than at
present. There may be a case for this,
but I do not propose it. Nor do I
believe we should provide—even if we
could define it—a “bare minimum”, for
a bare minimum rarely proves adequate
in the event.
The most pressing of our defence
needs is to expand rapidly our capacity
to meet invasion, infiltration and sub-
version in New Guinea. A plan is being
implemented to increase the size of the
Papuan Infantry Regiment from its
present 700 men to about 1400. Any-
one who has served in or read about
New Guinea will know that even 1400
men do not constitute a very consider-
able force to defend these 184,000
square miles of very difficult terrain.
We need to have one of our regular
battle groups located in New Guinea,
with its supporting arms and an adequate
number of transport and reconnaissance
helicopters. Parts of Papua-New Guinea
are not yet adequately mapped. We
need a crash programme to produce
accurate, gridded survey maps for every
square yard of the territory, including
the islands; and following that there
needs to be a continuing process of
map revision as roads are built, villages
move, and river courses change. The
development of communications within
the territory needs also to be accelerated.
At present our battalion in Malaya
with the Commonwealth Strategic Re-
serve (28th Commonwealth Brigade), the
squadron of Canberra bombers and the
two squadrons of Sabre fighters of the
RAAF located at Butterworth and Übon
are for small anti-terrorist actions in
Northern Malaya and—such was the
original intention—in a SEATO re-
serve role. We also have two destroyers
or frigates almost continuously in the
area. Presumably these forces are also
intended, if the situation becomes
desperate, for use in northern Borneo.
We presently have some 30 military
advisors and instructors in South
Vietnam. I do not believe that to commit
Australian ground forces to the defence
of that State, should the situation there
deteriorate, would be in the interests
of their most effective use or of the most
efficient defence of South Vietnam. So
long as there were not a simultaneous
need for them in Thailand, we could,
however, use RAAF fighter planes in
direct support of South Vietnamese and
—if they are committed—United States’
forces, without adding to the confusion
there or to the American logistic
problems. However, I shall refer to this
again. The present Communist terrorist
threat in Malaya is slight, and should
be handled by Malayans. This applies,
also, for the time being, to Indonesian
subversion activities against the penin-
sula. The two commitments therefore
which we must be ready to honor on
urgent call are: (1) to the north Borneo
States of Sabah and Sarawak, and (2)
to Thailand. There are two separate
commitments and they could well be
concurrent. If the 28th Commonwealth
Brigade is to be used for the defence
of northern Borneo against Indonesian
and perhaps also Chinese Communist
infiltration and subversion, there needs
to be a separate force, organised,
prepared and acclimatised, ready to help
in the defence of Thailand. This force
would need to be self-supporting and
not to rely on United States’ supplies
and transport. It would need, if it is
to be given a sector of its own, to be
able to be brought quickly to divisional
strength. It could also profitably be a
Commonwealth force, if the United
Kingdom and New Zealand would agree.
The alternative would be to place a
smaller force say, a battle group
under American command. This would
be unsatisfactory in many respects. If
we are to take part in a Commonwealth
division, we would need at least a
brigade or its equivalent, say two battle
groups. From a military point of view,
the force for the defence of the Borneo
States should be in the Borneo States;
the force for the defence of Thailand
should perhaps best as yet be in Malaya,
but preferably with a cadre in Thailand.
Pentropics
T et me deviate here to refer to the
organisation of the Australian Army.
The pentropic organisation, whereby a
division is composed of five battle groups
each of an expanded battalion of five
rifle companies with supporting arms,
was introduced in 1960. It was designed
to do several things: (1) to provide
a self-contained, flexible, hard-hitting
division, capable of fighting under con-
ventional or nuclear conditions in a
tropical area; (2) to shorten the
command process by eliminating the
brigade HQ when the division is together;
(3) to match with the American pentomic
division, of which it was a fairly close
copy. The word “pentropic” has become
a political and publicity catchword. We
read of the new pentropic army with
its new pentropic weapons. Everything
about the army, we are given to under-
stand, is better, more exciting, more
effective, because it is new, it is pen-
tropic. Yet could it be that, at the
political level, this catchword has become
not the symbol of a policy but a sub-
stitute for one? There is some evidence
that the Army and its political masters
would very much like to escape from
the catchword, but do not see how to.
As I heard one critic say recently: “The


“Cargo”
m
IS
nam
and our
The Cargo group of companies Ts made up of 13 major Aus-
tralian transport, storage and customs concerns. But we
started off as the Combined Activities of Rudders and Green
McCandlish Organisations—which spells Cargo. Which is what
we carry. Which is what we’re called. So call us Cargo, now.

pentropic system does not fit in with
the British (the Australian battalion in
Malay is not pentropically organised);
it does not fit in with the United States
(which has discarded the pentomic
organisation), and under existing circum-
stances it will not be used in operations.
Apart from that, it is splendid”. This
may be a little unfair. Yet anything
less than a complete division in the field
would be an embarrassment to our
allies.
The time has come for a critical,
clear-eyed reassessment of the pentropic
organisation. It has many merits; it also
has serious drawbacks. If it is going
to fight anywhere as a whole division,
it is questionable whether the divisional
commander can handle the simultaneous
tactical deployment of five infantry
battalions, an armored regiment, and
five artillery regiments. The same diffi-
culty applies to the battalion commander.
Exercises held so far, there is reason
to believe, have not been reassuring on
this point. The divisional HQ has built
into it the headquarters of a task force.
If a task force of three battle groups
is committed to a separate action, the
remaining two battle groups do not have
the flexibility needed for operations, as
they would not if they themselves con-
stituted a task force. The battle group is
not intended to fight on its own except
for very brief periods. The task force
remains the most likely operational
grouping, yet unlike the brigade group
it is an organisation only formed for
a specific operation. It does not train
and fight its units. The increased hit-
ting power brought into the pentropic
units needs to be retained, but there is
a case for reorganising the division into
two or three task forces (or brigade
groups) each of three somewhat smaller
battalions with supporting arms.
Two Anomalies
HThe present position in the Australian
Army is that we have on paper two
pentropic divisions, one being of two
regular army battle groups and three
Citizen Military Force battle groups
(with ARA cadres), and a second division
completely CMF (but with ARA cadres).
For the Ist Division it is planned to
raise a third regular army battle group.
The battalion in New Guinea has Aus-
tralian officers and senior NCOs; it is
on the old organisation, though some-
what smaller. The battalion in Malaya
is on the old organisation. Neither of
these two battalions could be brought
into a pentropic organisation without
considerable expansion and retraining.
Thus two of our present regular infantry
battalions are not interchangeable with
the other two. There may be a case for
the Papuan battalion being differently
organised. There is none for the others.
In the event of mobilisation, the CMF
personnel would be called up for full-
time service either at home or overseas,
and in probably something like six
months they (and the replacements for
drop-outs) would be ready to be com-
mitted into action. This unfortunately
is far too long. Here we have the first
major anomaly of our present system:
that the troops we are relying on to fill
our Army in the event of war will not,
in all probability, be ready when they
are needed. Now the kinds of operations
for which we are most likely to need
troops are not ones that would prompt
the Cabinet to ask the Governor-General
to declare mobilisation, i.e., in the border
skirmishes and in brushfire wars.
This is the second anomaly—that the
majority of our Army (the CMF) is
in being for the purpose of meeting
situations least likely to present them-
selves. Even in the event of a Korea-
type operation in Thailand, the way of
filling our ranks which would most
probably commend itself to the Govern-
ment would be as in Korea: direct
recruiting for the particular operation,
with a long preliminary period of
training. Apart from the situation of
an attack on the mainland it seems likely
that only sizeable operations in eastern
New Guinea would lead the Government
to call out the CMF.
From my reading of the situation in
South-East Asia, I would, therefore,
recommend that we have, in a duly ex-
panding regular or standing army, one
Australian battalion or battle group in
New Guinea, three in Malaysia (one in
a Borneo defence role with the United
Kingdom and two in a SEATO reserve
role, preferably as part of a Common-
wealth force). We would need to have
at least two also in Australia, for train-
ing, provision of reinforcements, and
home defence. If the present battle
group system is not retained, then we
would need a brigade group in Malaysia,
a further battalion in the Commonwealth
strategic reserve, a battalion group in
New Guinea and at least a brigade
group in Australia. What this amounts
to is approximately to double the present
combatant strength of the full-time Army.
It is unlikely that this could be done by
voluntary recruiting, although it would
have to be tried. The alternative is
selective national service political
dynamite, perhaps, but even dynamite
does not explode if handled carefully.
“Permanent Instant Reserve”
nPHE United States has had such a
system for years. Russia has it, Com-
munist China has it, Indonesia has it,
New Zealand has it. The selection and
grading process can ensure that the
burden falls where it may best be borne,
and the numbers actually called up de-
pend on the national needs at the time.
To be useful it would have to involve a
term of service of not less than two
years and include overseas service if
necessary. The luxury of restricting
overseas service to volunteers is some-
thing which Australia will eventually
have to learn to do without. The fact
that we will not again— at least in the
foreseeable future—be sending troops to
the Middle East or Europe but only to
our own “outer defence perimeters” in
South-East Asia may make obligatory
overseas service more digestible. An
alternative to locating so many troops in
Malaysia would be to have some of
them in Northern Queensland, where
climate and training conditions would be
comparable.
An alternative to selective national
service would be to provide (this applies
only to the Army) what I call a “per-
manent Instant Reserve”, something like
the CMF—in fact it could be the elite
of the CMF—but much better trained
than the CMF normally is, of necessity
smaller, integrated with ARA units, and
comprised of volunteers who had under-
taken to go on active service at seven
days’ notice for a term of duty of up to
six months. I understand that a varia-
tion of this idea is already under con-
sideration. Such a force would consist
of complete units, not just reinforce-
ments, and would constitute the second
wave in any emergency operation. Its
members —and perhaps their civilian
employers—would need to be specially
compensated. Part of its normal train-
ing should be under tropical jungle
conditions, say in New Guinea or in
Malaya, being transported there and
back by the RAAF. If such a force
were in being, we could perhaps reduce
the regular component needed to be
stationed in Malaysia in two battle
groups—one on the peninsula and one
in northern Borneo. The present CMF
system could be retained, being used as
it now in efFect is for the provision of
reinforcements and could also be trained

It may appear that so far we have
considered the Army in isolation from
the other services but that is not in
fact the case. The point is, as operations
in Korea and South-East Asia these past
13 years have confirmed so definitely,
that at least in this part of the world
under non-nuclear conditions there is no
substitute for holding the ground. To
hold it you must sit on it. To sit on it
you must have infantry soldiers however
you get them there, however you sup-
port them and supply them.
Four Squadrous
lay observer may wonder whether
the recent heavy expenditure on
new aircraft—or, on what will be new
aircraft when we get them—while war-
ranted in many ways, is somewhat of
an attempt to substitute money for men
in our defence policy. It is more politi-
cally expedient to spend a hundred mil-
lion pounds on buying new fighter planes
which will support the troops of other
nations in South-East Asia than to spend
ten millions in equipping our own troops
and sending them to South-East Asia.
Far fewer young men and parents of
young men are concerned.
Nevertheless, we must have aircraft.
We must have transport aircraft, to pro-
vide quick movement of troops, equip-
ment and supplies. We must have fighter
aircraft, to protect the transports, to
intercept, to destroy opposing fighters
and bombers, to establish air superiority
and to support ground operations. We
must have aircraft for bombing, both
for interdiction, destruction of enemy
bases, and as a general deterrent: we
must be able to bomb the home territory
—bases, installations, industries, etc. —of
any potentially hostile country able to
bomb Australian cities. We need air-
craft for reconnaissance. The separate
roles do not, of course, in these times,
necessarily require separate aircraft. We
must have helicopters, for anti-sub-
marine operations, for rescue work, and
for reconnaissance and transport opera-
tions in support of the Army.
We currently have, in the RAAF, four
squadrons (some 60 operational aircraft)
of Avon Sabre fighters fitted with Side-
winder air-to-air missiles—quite a form-
idable weapon—but the aircraft, while
suitable for ground support, is obsoles-
cent in many respects. Two of these
squadrons are located at Butterworth,
Malaya, with a “contingent” at Übon in
eastern Thailand. The other two squad-
rons are based on Williamtown, near
Newcastle. We have three squadrons
(about 24 operational aircraft at any
one time) of obsolete Canberra bombers,
one squadron at Butterworth and two
at Amberley, near Brisbane. We are
getting on loan, if we need them, “up to
two squadrons” of an obsolescent Ameri-
can bomber, the 847, which has in the
main a better performance than the
Canberras (e.g., can take far greater
bomb load). We have two squadrons
(about 20 operational aircraft) of mari-
time reconnaissance and anti-submarine
Neptune aircraft, half being P2V5s
(obsolescent) and the remainder PsV7s.
We have a squadron (say 10 operational
aircraft) of capacious Hercules C-130
transports, and two squadrons of that
trusty old warhorse, the Dakota. We
have some 12 Bell Iroquois helicopters
for search and rescue work, or for Army
co-operation. We also have a “squad-
ron” of surface-to-air Bloodhound Mk 1
guided missiles located at Williamtown.
On order we have: (1) 100 French Mir-
age 111 supersonic fighters— top class
machines —which will be supplied direct
and by part-Australian production at the
average rate of about 25 a year, com-
mencing later this year; (2) 18 Caribou
Mk 1 STOL (short take-off and landing)
transport aircraft, to supplement the
Dakotas, due to be delivered during the
first half of this year; (3) 24 (two squad-
rons) of the F-111A or TFX strike-re-
connaissance aircraft, delivery to begin
in 1967, or thereabouts; and (4) a further
12 Iroquois helicopters.
The Mirages will replace the Avon
Sabres in Butterworth, perhaps also
Übon, and in Australia. I assume that
some will be stationed in Darwin, as
interceptor fighters in the event of a
raid from the north, and also at William-
tow'n in reserve, for training and for the
protection of Sydney and the east coast
industrial complex. It w’ould seem that
once we have the Mirages, our fighter
capacity will be adequate for intercep-
tion. (I am not sure it will be as suitable
as the Sabre for providing close support
for limited operations.) What must be
ensured is that the ground facilities,
warning and guidance systems, are also
adequate. The Mirage in action requires
complex and expensive ground equip-
ment. To be brought into action in a
protective role there need also to be ad-
vanced radar warning installations. In
Australia such installations are at pre-
sent located in only two places near
Darwin nad Sydney; i.e., adding radar
and aircraft capacity, only Sydney now
is, and only Darwin and Sydney can on
present indications expect to be, pro-
tected from air attack. The Bloodhound
missiles at Williamtow'n, which are some-
times reported as going to Darwin, are
primarily for training. Their potential
for defence is very limited.
Now it is questionable whether the

provision of Australian land-based fighter
aircraft in any quantity would be a useful
contribution to Allied defence capacities
in South Vietnam and Thailand. The
problem is the extremely limited number
of aircraft which can operate with the
existing airfield and other facilities in
these countries. Thus any land-based air-
craft which we supply will not be in
addition to any supplied by the local or
the United States air forces, but instead
of them. I am not quite sure why we
have bought this number of Mirages, al-
though the move may turn out to be a
wise one. It seems unlikely that they are
intended for the defence of Australian
cities other than Sydney and Darwin.
They are only for use where there are
radar facilities to provide the necessary
warning and guidance. I suggest that
whether or not we have overspent on
fighters, we need to expand our major
radar facilities, perhaps by obtaining a
number of “mobile” installations such
as we currently have at Butterworth. Our
early warning system to the north needs
to be stretched wider. There may also
be a case for increasing or improving
the radar facilities in the south-east
coastal area.
The TFX
T have said that we need deterrent
1 ofa bomber capable of striking back
at the bases of any potentially hostile
power. The Canberras could be of some
use in this regard, but they are vulnerable
and inefficient and the distances involved
are too great, in most cases, for them to
be escorted by Sabres or Mirages. The
new TFX or F-111A, when it becomes
available in three or four or five years,
will be able to deliver a nuclear bomb
on any likely target. But reports from
the United States (e.g., “Aviation
Week”, September 9, 1963) have not yet
shown that the TFX will be able to carry
any sizeable weight of conventional
bombs*. It was not, of course, designed
as a bomber, but as a super-fighter with
long range, able to carry a nuclear bomb
internally. Is this what we want? There
are many highly technical aspects to the
selection of an aircraft, and many highly
political aspects; but we need more in-
formation before we can be reassured
that the TFX will meet our requirements.
I do not feel that we should be put in
the position of only being able to deliver
a nuclear bomb. The stand-by arrange-
ments for the American 847 bombers
may be satisfactory within the context
of the American alliance. The United
States has many of them in the Pacific
area, and presumably some of these
would be made available at short notice
to operate from Darwin or Butterworth.
How much more of a deterrent they will
be than the Canberras is not certain.
And in any case it will be some time
after they are received before the RAAF
will have crews trained to fly them.
They will increase the RAAF’s bombing
capacity, particularly to targets within
the escort range of land-based fighters.
For targets beyond that range, they might
need the escort of United States carrier-
based fighters, and under what circum-
stances this would be forthcoming we do
not know. We can say, therefore, that
our need is for a conventional bombing
capability which we do not know whether
w'e have or not, or whether we are going
to get it. The Australian public is entitled
to this information.
The squadron of Hercules transport
aircraft is adequate only in the event of
minor operations. A single Hercules can
take up to 92 troops without their heavy
equipment, or 17 tons of stores, for a
distance of about 1500 miles. Thus the
squadron could move a battle group (less
armored vehicles) from Sydney to Butter-
worth, via Darwin, in perhaps four trips
over a period of some 10-12 days. But
a battle group requires several hundred
tons of stores per week. If the present
policy of keeping the battle groups in
Australia is maintained, the Hercules
squadron would only be able, in the event
of an emergency in South-East Asia, to
transport and briefly supply a much re-
duced battalion. The remainder of the
battle group would have to go, and be
supplied, by sea. Perhaps the United
States would help us out with additional
transport aircraft. There are apparently
arrangements whereby in certain circum-
stances Australian civil airline planes can
be used. But it would seem preferable
that we should at least be able to move
and supply by air for an initial period
the personnel and light equipment of a
complete battle group. This would re-
quire us approximately to double our
present long- distance transport aircraft
capacity. The Caribous, which are rela-
tively small, short-haul machines, would
not help greatly in this regard. But
their short take-off and landing capacity
could make them valuable in moving
troops and stores from bases in the region
to forward landing strips.
Maritime reconnaissance (the patrol-
ling of our sea lanes) and aerial anti-
submarine warfare is at present divided
between the RAAF and the RAN, as it
will probably continue to be. Of the two
squadrons of Neptunes, one is located
at Townsville and one at Richmond.
Even the P2V7s are beginning to be-
come obsolescent as submarine detectors.
They are nevertheless very useful both
for reconnaissance, attack and, perhaps,
especially for minelaying. The two
squadrons of Westland Wessex helicop-
ters on board HMAS Melbourne are
probably our most effective anti-sub-
marine system, but their range is only
perhaps 150 miles from wherever the
carrier may happen to be. The Mel-
bourne is still apparently carrying some
of the Gannet anti-submarine aircraft
and the Venom fighters which are valu-
able, particularly for reconnaissance.
But these facilities appear likely only to
cover the east coast. An immediate
need would seem to be to provide mari-
time reconnaissance and some form of
anti-submarine potential on the shipping
routes out of Fremantle. There is also
a case for all maritime reconnaissance
aircraft coming under the one service
command.
To recapitulate, then, on the RAAF:
I suggest that we double our long-range
transport capacity, ensure that we have
the ability to get conventional bombs to
possible hostile bases, add to our recon-
naissance and anti-submarine potential
* i.e., at the supersonic speed which gives
the plane its protection. Note: Since this
paper was delivered, I have been authorita-
tively advised that this point is most valid in
operations against a country with a highly
developed air defence capability.

The RAN
A ustralia needs a navy (1) to protect
our mainland, especially our harbors
and cities, from sea-borne attack by a
hostile power; (2) to protect our sea
lines of communication, without which
our economy would rapidly collapse;
(3) to convey, and ensure, supplies to
the bulk of any forces we may have
operating outside the mainland; (4) in
certain circumstances to provide direct
support to those forces; and (5) to co-
operate with the navies of our allies in
common tasks.
For these purposes we currently have
in commission one aircraft-carrier, Mel-
bourne, which has been converted to a
primarily anti-submarine role and
carries more than 20 Westland Wessex
helicopters; four destroyers, Voyager,
Vendetta, Vampire, and the older
Anzac [this paper was written before
the recent naval tragedy. Ed.]; four
new type-12 frigates, Parramatta, Yarra,
Stuart and (about to commission) Der-
went; a further older frigate, Quiberon,
and six coastal minesweepers. The
former aircraft-carrier Sydney has been
refitted as a transport for vehicles,
equipment, and a few troops. There are
also a fleet replenishment tanker, and
survey, oceanographic, and other miscel-
laneous ships. On order are three United
States’ guided missile destroyers of the
“Charles F. Adams” type. The first,
Perth, is due to be commissioned about
the middle of next year, and the other
two will follow a year or two later. Also
on order are four conventional British
“Oberon” class submarines, the first of
which is due to commission in 1966,
and an escort maintenance ship, the
keel of which is being laid this month.
It should be in service in about three
years’ time. We have currently based
on Australia three British submarines,
which are used mainly for anti-subma-
rine training. In reserve are two destroy-
ers and three frigates, which could be
made operational in something like three
months, and sundry small craft.
The fighting capacity of the RAN thus
consists of: an anti-submarine carrier
which cannot protect itself, except in a
limited way, against air or surface
attack; nine escort ships, and three
elderly British submarines attached. Two
of the escort ships are kept with the
Commonwealth Strategic Reserve. Are
Australia’s defence needs met by this
force, and by the forthcoming additions
to it?
The first task it may be called on to
do is to work with the British and
Malayan Navies in protecting the shores,
the fishing and merchant ships, of
Malaysia against Indonesia. Let us look
briefly at the Indonesian Navy. We do
not know exactly what ships it consists
of, nor in what state of repair those
ships are, but there is one Soviet cruiser,
of the “Sverdlovsk” class, and there are
probably something like four frigates,
18 motor torpedo boats, 8 patrol boats,
and between 12 and 20 submarines. If
it wants to, the Indonesian Navy can
make a good deal of trouble in the
Strait of Malacca and elsewhere. It could
land a considerable number of sub-
versives, both in Malaysia (which I
believe it is now doing) and New Guinea.
In the unlikely event of Australia being
at war with Indonesia, our two major
shipping routes —to Japan and to Europe
via Suez—would be especially vulnerable
to Indonesian submarines operating at
short range from their bases and to the
cruiser. And if 20 submarines does not
sound many it is a lot more than our
three on loan, or the four we will have
by 1968.
The anti-aircraft potential of our Navy
is also slight. The type-12 frigates have
the Seacat short-range surface-to-air
guided missiles, and the Adams
destroyers will have the American
Tartar missiles, but the remainder of
the fleet is equipped with obsolete or
obsolescent anti-aircraft guns. Our ability
to protect convoys against air attack is
thus not considerable.
Our capacity is greatest in general
defence against surface ships equipped
with conventional naval artillery. But
here again the number of our escort
vessels is probably fewer than the safe
minimum, and against vessels fitted with
surface-to-surface missiles our naval
defence is currently nil. Also anything
short of minor skirmishes is going to
bring in hostile submarines.
I have spoken so far wholly in terms
of naval defence. But offensive capacity
is also a vital part of defence. In this
regard, there is no question that sub-
marines and carrier-based aircraft are
excellent weapons of offence.
It would seem to make sense to do
two things soon: increase the number of
our escort vessels (perhaps the less ex-
pensive frigates, such as type 12s), and
obtain an aircraft-carrier capable of
taking strike aircraft and anti-submarine
helicopters. It is not impossible that an
American aircraft-carrier could be
obtained and refitted within a fairly short
period of time at not astronomical costs,
and the possibility of providing it with
VTOL (vertical take-off and landing)
fighters is worth examining. The pro-
vision of helicopter landing stages to
other vessels, both naval and mercantile,
also merits consideration, thus providing
a certain anti-submarine capacity to
otherwise vulnerable vessels. And pro-
vision should also be made for the some-
what less gradual increase of our sub-
marine strength.
A Carrier
A n aircraft-carrier has numerous prob-
lems associated with it. It is a very
large and visible basket in which to put
so many eggs. A single carrier under
attack can usually do little more than
defend itself and adjacent ships. Tactics
require two carriers to work together,
each within range of the other’s planes.
But to keep two carriers operational,
you need at least three, and preferably
four. Shall we, then, buy four carriers?
If we did, it would be some years before
we could man them. The three or four
carriers would not all need to be Aus-
tralian, and so long as our single carrier
—for I only propose one at the moment
—were co-ordinated with British and/or
American carriers operating in the area,
it could perform its several roles as
needed: anti-aircraft, anti-submarine,
convoy escort, or flexible base for close
support of land operations. It would
also be a useful addition to the Allied
strength in the area. Of course, unless
allied co-operation were assured, one
carrier would be a hazardous investment.

order. It is to be fitted out as an
advanced base for the repair of damage,
the maintenance and repair of weapons,
machinery and electronic equipment in
escort vessels—destroyers and frigates:
a floating workshop. This will be a most
useful addition to our naval capacity,
when it is eventually in service. But it is
questionable whether it eliminates the
need for other land repair and main-
tenance facilities along our sea lines of
communication. It cannot do the work
of a dry dock. At present there are
readily available to us in South-East
Asia and the South-West Pacific only
two bases where docking and major
repair facilities are available—Sydney
and Singapore. Singapore will probably
be available to us so long as the need
to defend Malaysia exists —but available
on what terms? The long strike of
workers at the base last year could be
repeated at any time. In other words,
we can rely only on Sydney, where the
docking facilities are still limited. One
of our ships in need of substantial
repairs in the Indian Ocean or the South
China Sea would have to steam or be
towed 36,000 miles to get into a dock.
It is possible in peace-time; it could
be disastrous in an emergency. We need
to think about a naval base to our
north and on our west coast, and I
would suggest that we begin the re-
activation of Manus, and the creation
of a base at Cockburn Sound in Western
Australia, as being the two most suitable
locations. These would serve the navies
of our allies, as well as the merchant
ships along our trade routes. We could
perhaps (though we should be ashamed
to do so) ask our allies to help finance
the bases.
Finally, with respect to the Navy, there
is the question of minesweeping. We
now have six minesweepers, including
two fitted for mine detection.' This is a
recent and vital addition to our fleet.
Perhaps plans could be made to increase
our minesweeping capacity, especially
the number of detection units.
Nuclear Weapons
Ohould Australia have nuclear weapons
of any kind? The question may be
somewhat academic, because there is no
evidence that we could get them even
if we wanted them. If Indonesia were
to obtain the capacity to deliver ap
atomic or nuclear bomb, then we would
have to reconsider our position and
indeed our whole strategy; but unless or
until that happens, or until an invasion
of our continent appears imminent, to
have such bombs in Australia would be
both provocative and unnecessary.
Against whom would we prepare to
use them? As for tactical atomic
weapons, they also are unnecessary, even
if they are obtainable. The only time
such weapons are likely to be used in
the near future is in the event of mass
attacks against Thailand by Laotian and/
or Chinese troops. In such circum-
stances, the American battalions of
tactical atomic weapons will perhaps be
brought into action. I assume that our
Government has arranged that if such
weapons are used in support of American
troops, they will also be used in support
of Australian troops fighting alongside
the Americans. What is essential is that
our Army and Air Force must be trained
in the tactics involved in such operations
—the precautions that have to be taken,
the changes in deployment, the effects
on supplies, communications, etc. Reports
indicate that this is now being done,
at least to a degree. There may be a
case for a naval nuclear ability, but
this would need most careful investiga-
tion. (There is certainly a case for a
naval nuclear-propulsion ability.)
Australia’s industrial capacity is one
aspect of our defence that is reassuring.
For our size, we are a highly indus-
trialised nation. Our present defence
production is not considerable, but it
is adequate. We can build moderately
complex vessels such as frigates; we can
produce aircraft (to other peoples’
designs, usually), though in small
numbers. We produce our own small
arms and ammunition, machine-guns,
ordnance of various kinds, projectiles,
and other military equipment. We could,
if necessary, after due preparation,
produce armored vehicles, as we have
in the past. We have extensive engineer-
ing manufacturing capacity in all fields,
and a high degree of expertise in the
sophisticated radio and electronics in-
dustries. We have important and pro-
ductive defence research establishments.
And the gearing of private industry to
defence needs in the event of an
emergency receives continuing attention
through the courses in defence mobilisa-
tion conducted by the Defence Depart-
ment, although security requirements
do not make this aspect easy to evaluate.
Let me add quickly a few miscel-
laneous needs that there is not space
to discuss in detail:
1. We need to ensure that our service-
men are ideologically armed not
“indoctrinated”, but aware of the great
benefits of the democratic way of life,
and the Christian values which are the
basis of our society. They need to be
able to think and talk about this intelli-
gently. They need also to be aware of
the ideologies of potential opponents.
Australian servicemen are not inherently
superior to the servicemen of other
nations. Such superiority as they may
need in operations must come from
better education, training, equipment,
command, morale and sense of purpose.
2. We need to increase greatly the
ability of our servicemen to speak , the
language of the countries in which they
are likely to serve.
3. Our armed forces need an improved
professional status. They need better
conditions of service, better housing,
better educational provisions for their
children, better retirement and resettle-
ment provisions. Terms of service for
our officers should not be such as to
force an enthusiastic and efficient man
to retire prematurely, or to prevent a
bored or inefficient one from leaving
the service.
4. Our army needs more modern
landing craft for men and equipment.
It may also need a heavier gun to
supplement the 105 mm, which is inferior
in range and explosive power to that
used by, for example, Communist forces
in South-East Asia. All services, and
especially the Navy and Air Force if
they are to expand, need a greater pro-
vision of technically trained personnel.
5. All servicemen need to be trained
in defence against chemical, biological,
and radiational warfare.
6. We need to take a good look at
the internal communications within Aus-
tralia—at the benefits which could ensue,
for example, from sealing the east-west
road, improving or developing roads in
the north, or extending the railway to
Darwin.
7. We need to give serious thought
to the idea of a joint Services defence
college along the lines of the IDC
(Imperial Defence College), but at a
lower level say, lieutenant - colonel/
colonel and equivalent, and to include
defence civilians of the five relevant de-
partments.
8. We need to begin looking beyond
the Mirage and the TFX and the Adams
destroyer.
9. We need to speed up the hydro-
graphic survey of the Australian coasts.
I have been told that, at the present
rate, the task would be complete by
about the middle of the next century.
10. We need Continuity in our Service
ministers.


OUT AND ABOUT
One of the Motoring
Montagus
The stompers in the stately home
By JAN SMITH
At Mascot airport, said the publicity
man, Lord Montagu of Beaulieu
had really swung, displaying all
the charm and mild self-depreciation that
stately housing problems seem to en-
gender. But later, at Menzies Hotel, the
interviews and hot weather had left his
Oxford unflappability just a little ruffled.
A semi-bald young man of 38 with
a pink face, Lord Montagu sat warily
on a small stool, surrounded by a sea
of luggage and brochures. “I suppose
you could say my father was eccentric,”
he admitted, glancing for affirmation at
Lady Montagu, who, as Belinda Crossley,
had been the girl next door in his life
at Beaulieu. “Lor one thing he was mad
about cars, and then he went into
journalism—mostly as a motoring writer,
of course.”
Lather was also a train enthusiast
who learnt the hard way at the Swindon
workshops and actually drove trains in
the 1926 strike, when he was over 60.
The main purpose of his visit, Lord
Montagu said, was to show his collection
of model vintage cars in Sydney, Mel-
bourne, Brisbane and Perth. The models
are replicas of those in the Montagu
Motoring Museum at Beaulieu, which
grew out of his father’s passion for
the automobile. “He started his motor
magazine, ‘Car Illustrated,’ in 1902,”
Lord Montagu said. “He subtitled it
‘A Journal of Travel by Land, Sea and
Air,’ which when you come to think
about it was quite prophetic, because
until the Lirst World War travel by air
was not feasible.”
Lord Montagu spends three days a
week in London editing his own
magazine, “Veteran and Vintage,” which
is now in its seventh year. He has
written four motoring books, “The
Motoring Montagus,” “Lost Causes of
Motoring” (about firms that went broke),
a book about Jaguars and another about
the Gordon Bennett motor races in the
early part of this century. He also com-
missions other writers to do books on
certain makes of cars to form a series
he has in progress.
The Motor Museum was opened in
1952, and has about 200 cars including
modern racers. The earliest model is
an 1895 Knight, a hand-made vehicle
like a small dogcart that was England’s
first petrol-driven car.
The Motor Museum costs £40,000 a
year to maintain, with a large amount
going to subsidise the reference library,
which receives as many as 100 letters
a day from car enthusiasts. Offers to
sell vintage and veteran cars run into
10 a week, and the museum and library
employ a curator, several librarians and
a commercial manager to cope with
enquiries. So far Lord Montagu has had
no luck in his quest for a 1948 Holden.
The Montagu cars have taken him on
extensive tours of Canada, the United
States and South America, and although
the main business of the day is motoring,
the ultimate issue, is, of course, Beaulieu.
Something about Beaulieu seemed
familiar. Wasn’t there a book? “Yes,”
said Lord Montagu, “ ‘The White
Company’. Conan Doyle used to hold
seances there, but it was a bit before
my time. There are stories about monks
singing, but nothing spectacular.”
Like Woburn, Beaulieu began life as
a Cistercian abbey, founded in 1204,
with the monks farming peacefully
among the sheep and vineyards until the
1538 dissolution by Henry VIII gave the
property to Lord Montagu’s ancestors,
the Earls of Southampton. A daughter
of the 4th Earl married a Duke of
Montagu.
The Duke of Bedford and Lord
Montagu are not close friends, but
having so much in common it seems only
natural for Montagu to speak about him
rather as an elderly uncle who has
been through it all. “I’d say his expenses
were definitely greater than ours,
wouldn’t you, dear?” he said, turning
to his wife, and went on to regret that
he and the Duke hadn’t timed their
visits to coincide.
On leaving Oxford, Lord Montagu
started out in advertising, to combat the
usual stately problem of death duties.
“Why do you work?” asked Lady
Montagu, a little testily, as her husband
went on to describe his rise into public
relations, where from 1950 to 1954 he
furthered the cause of Oporto wines,
Cadbury’s chocolates and a Hulton Press
publication, Eagle Comics.
“They were very good ones,” Lord
Montagu explained. “They did educa-
tional things like the Bible in cartoon
form.”
Lady Montagu worked as a freelance
commercial artist before her marriage
and implied that the going hadn’t been
too smooth. One only got £5 for a dust-
jacket, and the really fun things to
do, like record sleeves, came up far too
seldom because so many photographs
were used these days. She now divides

m
a
Appointment of
Principal
APPLICATIONS are invited for the position of
Principal of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal
Studies which is now functioning in Canberra under
the control of an Interim Council. The Institute is
intended primarily to sponsor, through relevant
university departments and museums, a wide range
of scholarly research on the indigenous society, cul-
ture, habitat and mental and physical characteris-
tics of the Australian Aborigines. It is intended that
the Institute will have associated with it about 100
members from all parts of Australia, and will be
governed by a Council with a small Executive Com-
mittee. For the position of Principal the Interim
Council is seeking a scholar eminent in some disci-
pline relevant to Aboriginal studies. The position
will carry a salary in the range £A4,000 —£5,000 per
annum according to qualifications and experience.
Provision will be made for removal, travel and
other expenses when on official duty; suitable
arrangements will be made for superannuation and
study leave. %
Information is available from the Executive Member,

City P. 0., Canberra, A.C.T. Applications, supported
by the names of three referees, should be received
by the Executive Member by 30th April, 1964.
her time between her three-year-old
son Ralph and designing tea towels and
menus for the restaurant and gift shops
at Beaulieu.
Beaulieu also has a Maritime Museum,
which grew out of the shipyard
established at Buckler’s Hard in 1749 by
Henry Adams. It was here that most
of Nelson’s navy was built, and the
Museum’s bigger attractions includes a
model of his “Agamemnon,” a 74-
gunner Nelson commanded in the Battle
of the Nile.
The shipyard, in its turn, had evolved
from a proposed sugar port called Mon-
taguville, intended by the second Duke
of Montagu to receive shiploads of sugar
from the West Indies, a project that was
quashed by French hostilities in the area.
From 1956 to 1961 Beaulieu was
offering its visitors an annual jazz festival,
which ceased when the Montagus found
just how wild a crowd of 20,000 plus
can be. “They were getting completely
out of hand,” said Lady Montagu.
Cause of art
Any spare time left from running
Beaulieu is spent water-skiing, fish-
ing, sailing or shooting pheasant and par-
tridge in the New Forest. They have
a modern get-away house on the Solent,
designed by Sir Hugh Casson.
Lord Montagu is also here to further
the cause of art, officially opening an
exhibition of his grandfather’s 50 water-
colors and sketches at the Mitchell
Library in February. Grandfather, Lord
Henry Douglas-Scott-Montagu, came
here to look around in 1853, when he
was 21, and during his six months’ stay
rode with two clergymen from Sydney
to Brisbane, stopping off at Morpeth to
stay with the newly appointed Bishop
Tyrrel of Newcastle, formerly the
Beaulieu vicar.
The watercolors, small, pretty scenes,
had been tucked away at Beaulieu until
a visiting Australian gave Lord Montagu
the happy idea of bringing them here,
under the guidance of the Mitchell
Library, for the greater glory of Beaulieu.
The opening went off well, with a
salvo of welcoming speeches about ties
with our homeland, and Lord Montagu,
after hinting that the collection might
find its way to Newcastle and Brisbane,
happily announced that one missing
painting from the collection, given to
his aunt’s husband, Lord Forster, in
1920 to mark his appointment as
Governor-General, had been found.
Lord Montagu, it should be pointed
out, is not the Lord Montagu who was
discovered by the afternoon papers
working as a David Jones’ shop assistant
in 1961. “There has been some con-
fusion,” said Lord Montagu smoothly,
“but of course that was Angus. It’s
just an honorary title because he’s the
younger son of the Duke of Manchester
who lives somewhere in Africa. We’re
having dinner with them, aren’t we,
dear?”
There is a connection somewhere for
anyone who cares to battle with Debrett,
but it is no use buttonholing floorwalkers
because Lord Angus Montagu is now
working for Ampol, and when last seen
was planning a visit to the Tempe
Salvation Army depot to help his wife
fossick for bargain-priced antiques for
their flat in Woollahra.
Easy lies the head that need not worry
about the trippers and the stompers in
the West Wing.

Awareness of

A new look for
Australian flowers
By PETER STEVENS
Norman Sparnon’s sumptuous book
“Japanese Flower Arrangement”,
published in Tokyo by the Ameri-
can-Japanese firm of Charles E. Tuttle,
has run to four editions since it appeared
in 1960, despite its 15-dollar price. It
has been an international success, and
the writing of it crowned a success story,
too.
Sparnon is an Australia!! He learnt
Japanese as a young man, became a war-
time Intelligence officer, and in 1946
found himself in the translation section
of Allied headquarters in Tokyo. His
American wife, who was with him, be-
gan having lessons in the ancient art
of flower arrangement, or ikebana,
alongside which the floral art of the West
is rated a mere domestic hobby.
As she could speak no Japanese and
her teacher spoke no English, Sparnon
used to translate for them. Before long
he said, “I might as well sit here and do
this myself as sit here and tell you what
to do,” and started learning himself.
When Sparnon left Japan twelve years
later he had become an accredited
master of both the Ikenobo (classical)
and Sogetsu (modern) schools of ar-
rangement. It was an unprecedented
achievement for a Westerner. He wrote
his book, and came home to give exhi-
bitions and teach. He felt that with its
simplicity and subtle beauty ikebana
could be a cultural link between Austra-
lia and Japan. Now he has a studio in
Sydney, spends one week a month teach-
ing in his home town of Melbourne,
gives lectures to enthusiastic students all
over the country, and keeps an eye on
the several Australian chapters of Ike-
bana International that have been set up.
Sparnon flew to New Zealand earlier
this month for a lecture tour, his first
there. Before he left he produced the
manuscript of a book he has been work-
ing on for 18 months. It is “Australian
Wildflowers and Ikebana”, with 100 color
photographs illustrating his arrangements
of 150 species. The pictures are by Keith
Barlow and Don Cameron, of “The
Australian Women’s Weekly”. Sparnon
said that Australian wildflowers have
good form and make exciting material.
He thinks they will be a sensation in
Japan and America, where there is al-
ready interest in Australian flowers. This
time he hopes to have an Australian
edition of the book issued by a local firm
jointly with his Tokyo publishers.


Around Melbourne
PIES-BLACK, BRINDLE, AND GOLDEN
Come strange things have been
happening in St Kilda Road.
Mr Whelan the Wrecker has been
pulling down a two-storey block of
offices worth at least £70,000, just
to make parking space for McClure’s
restaurant. We have got to the stage
in St Kilda Road where cars are more
important than buildings.
Now, Les McClure is one of the
characters of this town. He likes to
describe himself as “a little b r
from the country.” He is little inso-
far as a few years back he sold out
his interest in Four’n’Twenty pies to
Peters for £600,000. At the time
Four’n’Twenty had 59 radio-operated
pie vans. If there was a pie emergency
anywhere in Melbourne the master
control could send pies by the dozen
flashing to the spot.
Les has a big office at 454 St Kilda
Road. He has a picture of Sir Winston
Churchill on the wall, a bust of
Churchill that smokes real cigars,
and a slogan on the mantel: “He has
the right to criticise who has the heart
to help.” As for Mr McClure’s
smoking habits, he says that he
smoked like a chimney from the age
of eight to 13, but, like Churchill,
he has only smoked cigars since.
Until he was 13 he only went to
school for two hours a day. He
started working for his uncle on a
milk round. He used to rise at 3 a.m.,
help milk 40 cows, then deliver milk
around Hamilton. This done he
would get 10 minutes for lunch, milk
the cows again, and knock off at 7
p.m.
For this he was paid 30s. a week.
Naturally, one put the obvious ques-
tion. What did he do with his even-
ings? Well, he used.to play the fiddle
with a dance group for 10s. a night,
four nights a week, and, twice a
month, for 155., there was a special
do with the Caledonian Society when
he didn’t go to bed at all.
In 1933, when Les was 26, his
uncle sold out, and the newcomer
reduced his salary by 10s. So Les
borrowed some money, rented a farm
for £BO and, he remembers, he used
to deliver his milk with four-gallon
cans strung over the handle bars of
his bicycle. He built a dairy opposite
the transport business of another
little b r from the country, Reg
Ansett.
Soon he was buying milk from
other people and delivering it all over.
He acquired three horses and carts
but, best of all, he got a milk bar,
then another, and another, plus a milk
bar in Portland. Then in February,
1939, he sold up all his Hamilton-
Portland interests and went into
Bendigo.
One of his stunts was to have a
milk bar - restaurant. There was a
hole in the window with the message,
Lookie Lookie Lookie Here’s Cookie.
And inside, 10, there was a cook
making pies. They sold like crazy.
Some of the big Bendigo operators
were not keen on this competition.
One told him quietly that he had
better ease up or they would cut the
price of pies from threepence to a
penny.
Les said: “I pointed out, hell, I
couldn’t sell pies at a penny. So I
would stop. Then I would wait until
they put their price up to threepence
again to make a profit. Then I’d
start making pies again.”
Tn late 1942 he had to cope with an
A ice cream war. His sales were way
down so he ordered 20 cans, 100
gallons of ice cream, and he an-
nounced that he would give it away
the next day at 1.30 p.m. He said:
“Jeez, I’ll never forget it. They had
to call out the fire brigade, police
and ambulance. By 1.30 p.m. there
were 3000 kids, every kid in Bendigo,
outside the shop. It cost me 70 quid
but it sure stabilised the ice cream
business in Bendigo.”
He had a string of cafes and milk
bars in Bendigo and in 1946 John
Lienhop, now Sir John, asked him to
cater for the Bendigo races, and the
next thing he knew he was invited to
cater at Melbourne’s Royal Show.
Nobody would sell him pies in Mel-
bourne so he had to bring in pies
from all over the country.
Les says that all his life he has
been forced into doing things. He
wanted to have a pie machine in the
window at the Show, so he had to
conform with the Factory Act—l2ft.
ceiling, the proper ventilation —and it
all cost him a small fortune. So, as
he says, from being a mere caterer
he had to become a pie manufacturer
to recoup his money.
The years 1950 and 1951 were
dreadful years for Four’n’Twenty. He
had the first pie-making machine but
they couldn’t get it to work properly.
The pies came out black, brown and
brindle.
Again one had to ask the pertinent
question: “What did you do with the
crook pies?” Said Mr McClure:
“1950 and 1951 were very good years
for the pig men.”
He called in every kind of expert
and had to sell everything he owned
in Bendigo to keep afloat. However,
by 1955 they were really moving and
in 1956 they decided to import the
biggest pie machine the country had
ever seen. They couldn’t get the
import licence so they built it them-
selves. It produced 1200 dozen pies
an hour and, according to Les, on
good days between 1956 and 1959
they were producing 8000 dozen pies
a day.
So, like a good boxer, he left pies
at the peak of his form. Now he has
the public catering at Flemington
Races, part of the catering at the
Melbourne Show and McClure’s
restaurant in St Kilda Road.
McClure’s, because of competition
from Robb’s and the Carousel at
Albert Park, has not been as good as
pie-making, so he is gambling with his
expensive car park and a second
restaurant called the 454 Room,
which will open in May. It will be
interesting to see what gimmicks he
will introduce. His gimmick for the
old restaurant opened in 1961 was a
telephone on every table, so that you
wouldn’t have to wait for a waiter—
you could call the cook direct. Also
he put a pop-up toaster on every
table.
According to Les McClure the only
way to get fresh toast is to cook your
own.

OVERSEAS
The Bland Face of
Mr Chou
The Chinese in Africa are undeniably creepy
From ANTHONY SAMPSON in Nairobi
evolutionary prospects are ex-
rC cellent throughout the African
continent,” said Chou En-lai at
the end of his African tour recently, as
casually as a company chairman dis-
cussing next year’s profits.
When asked what he meant by revo-
lution, he explained reassuringly that he
meant economic development and over-
throwing outside forces. But the remark
has made a large impact on Africa, and
his hosts and would-be hosts in the in-
dependent African States must be won-
dering anxiously: revolution against
whom?
Africa has only recently become aware
of China and Chou En-lai’s tour, coin-
ciding with the fears: Could China sub-
vert the fragile new African States by
pushing forward second revolutions of
the black proletariat against the new
black elite? Might China learn from
Russia’s colossal mistakes? Could China
appear to Africans as the leader of the
non-white nations, combining the appeals
of racialism and Communism?
The Chinese presence in Africa is un-
deniably creepy. Her diplomats move
quietly into isolated embassies with big
red flags and tasselled lanterns and reply
to Western inquiries with embarrassed
giggles.
They shun encounters with the West
and, unlike the newer Russians, regard
all contact as corrupting or compromis-
ing. They secretly pay money to African
politicians wfio give mysterious favors
in return. The powerful transmitter of
Peking Radio beams Marxist lectures and
intimidating statistics all over Africa. The
conjunction of inscrutable China with
unpredictable Africa provides a festival
for witch-hunters and plot-mongers.
How much real danger lies behind all
this? It is hard to disentangle the African
muddle from Chinese plotting. Certainly,
in view of China’s declared revolution-
ary policies, no liberal dare ignore the
possibilities of plots.
There is no doubt that many African
countries will want to learn a lot from
China, whose example seems in many
w 7 ays much closer to them than Russia’s.
Many Africans (such as the Ghanaians
who rioted in Moscow) find the Russians
too bourgeois in politics and compro-
mise. China is poor, agrarian, vast, iso-
lated, enthusiastic, and only now begin-
ning to feel her way and her weight in
the world.
African reactions to China vary enor-
mously. Some, like Emmanuel Hevi, the
young Ghanaian who has just published
a book called “An African Student in
China,” find Chinese universities over-
crowded, doctrinaire, inadequate and
dull. But it was difficult to find a unani-
mous view: these are some stray com-
ments I noted in Africa:—
They’re Cultivated people—not rough
like the Russians.
They just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk—
nothing but politics.
Being yellow doesn’t help them much,
as far as we're concerned. They’re not
black, let’s face it. Let's face it!
These comments are, I think, firstly
typical and important. There is not much
sign that the non-whiteness of the Chinese
gives them much diplomatic advantage.
In conversation they say “We black
brothers,” but that is not convincing,
and it is not their race but their common
experience of humiliation and poverty
that is the bond.
Second, the Africans are absolutely
determined to work out their own kind
of Socialist society.
Third, and perhaps this is the most
important consideration, Africa and
China are extremely remote from each
other. China and Africa have few natural
points of contact, and the difficulties of
communication are immense.
Fourth, China’s own poverty and
austerity are a very doubtful recom-
mendation in the present mood of
Africa. The fact that Chou En-lai and
his party flew round Africa in two old-
fashioned propeller planes, made in
America and flown by Dutchmen,
seemed to sum up the objection: and
however much China may generate the
right kind of goodwill, she cannot for
the time being provide much of what
Africa wants capital, expertise and
experience.
These objections suggest that there is
not much natural affinity between
Africa and China.
Yet the possibility exists that the new
trends in Africa may, in the long run,
play into China’s hands. The return of
British troops to East Africa has dis-
played to the radical youth wings how
incomplete their uhuru has been, and
how near at hand the old imperialists
still are: the cliches about neo-colonialism
now seem much less hollow. The new
middle-class elites of Africa, with their
Western habits and their comfortable
lives, will become increasingly vulnerable
to the proponents of a drastic second
revolution. If China enters the United

From PATRICK SEALE
in Mogadishu
TLTr Chou En-lai came to Africa
wearing two hats: a silk topper and
a guerrilla beret.
He came as a proud, prestige-con-
scious Prime Minister of the most
populous nation on earth, but also as
the would-be leader of a world-wide
revolutionary movement.
His extremely delicate task as he
toured the continent over the past two
months has been to appear convincing
in both roles. He has had to make
a simultaneous appeal to different
audiences on two quite distinct levels.
To cut through the fog that still
surrounds China’s hopes and tactics, it
may be said that Chou was more evident
in his first role than in his second. While
most African leaders were ready to
receive him with the awed respect due
to a representative of a nation
650,000,000 strong, as an embattled
revolutionary they held him gingerly at
arm’s length.
In official dealings with Governments
there can be little doubt of Chou’s
achievements. He has been busy mend-
ing fences, winning recognition, patching
up China’s image, seeking to break out of
the isolation into which she was driven
by her quarrel with both Russia and the
United States. On this level Chou has
been a silver-tongued and persuasive
salesman.
He has dealt amicably with kings and
with bourgeois nationalist leaders in
emerging countries eager for aid but
jealous of their independence. By the
very nature of his diplomatic offensive
he has been forced to woo the very men
whom he accused the Russians of court-
ing.
His strategy has been to call for a
return to the conciliatory spirit of Ban-
dung —the scene of his first great inter-
national triumph in 1955. Peaceful co-
existence; live and let live; respect for
sovereignty and territorial integrity;
settlement of international disputes by
negotiation rather than armed force—
these are the principles with which Chou
has sought to repair the considerable
damage caused to China’s record by her
attack on India and by her vituperative
hostility to the Moscow Test Ban Treaty.
But these were not the only or even
the prime objectives of Chou's extended
African tour. In speech after speech,
and in furious behind-the-scenes activities
of China’s diplomatic missions, a far
more ambitious design could be detected.
Chou was making a bid for the leader-

ship not only of the international Com-
munist movement but also of the whole
of the non-Western world.
In this task his enemy is Russia as
much as, if not more than, the West. It
is also staunch neutralist independents
such as Colonel Nasser and today even
M. Sekou Toure of Guinea —backed by
Mr Nehru and Marshal Tito who
reject China’s tutelage as vigorously as
that of Russia or the Western Powers.
This then was Chou’s dilemma in
Africa: he was forced to pursue conflict-
ing aims. To win respectability and es-
tablish normal relations with other coun-
tries he had in one breath to call for
peaceful coexistence. But to seize the
leadership of the Communist movement
and of Africa, Asia and Latin America
he had to preach revolution.
In this fierce struggle Chou can claim
no great success. He has no very good
news to report back to his Central Com-
mittee in Peking.
Throughout his African tour China's
offensive appeared three - pronged. On
one level the violent ideological argu-
ment with the Russians continued at
full blast. Chou personally took little
part in it and avoided reference to the
Sino-Soviet split. But the wordy contest
with Russia is a continuing Chinese
endeavor, uninterrupted by Chou’s
visit.
Chou himself has concentrated on
two other themes: the need to summon
a second “Bandung” conference, and the
close community of interest of the Afro-
Asian world. But these appeals fell
rather flat.
As for Afro-Asian solidarity under
Chinese leadership, there was little
enthusiasm for Chou’s thesis that the
underdeveloped world should rely mainly
on its own efforts, jacking itself up by
its own bootstraps. It was only too
evident to many African leaders that
this Chinese doctrine of self-help was
dictated by China’s own lack of
resources.
But of all the obstacles Chou had to
face the greatest was the enormous
suspicion of the Chinese bred through-
out the continent by the revolution in
Zanzibar, and the three army mutinies
in East Africa. There may be no firm
evidence to convict China —or any Com-
munist country —of instigating these dis-
turbances. But several African States
have as a result looked to their defences.
After what happened in Zanzibar and
Tanganyika, revolution has come to
suggest something more immediate and
shattering than the long march on the
road to Socialism, which Chou explained
he meant. No African leader was wholly
insensible to Chou’s personal charm but
one or two have since begun to wonder
what dark thoughts lie behind that
delicate smile, (ofns)

Britain’s Spare-Time
Soldiers
Reforming the U.K. Army
From PATRICK O’DONOVAN in London
The British Army is, just now, spread
. . J
as thin as workhouse margarine.
There is no conscription to back ,t up
and in an election year no serious poll-
lician is going to advocate bringing it
back. How nations face and solve such
military difficulties tells a good deal
about their true character. Britain has
no clear solution at all to offer. A fervent
hope that the fusillade of small crises all
over the world is over, a plan to involve
allies in at least one trouble spot, and
reliance upon a voluntary, part-time
army behind the Regular Army this
is about as far as it o o es
' Britain’s Territorfal Army has a long
and honorable record of essential ser-
vice. In peacetime, however, it tends to
droop and dwindle, to turn into a sort
of get-away-from-the-old-woman male
social club with military undertones.
But this pleasant and innocuous tra-
dition has gone the way of many easy
customs. The Territorial Army is an in-
creasingly professional body today. It
has been reorganised in line with changes
r» i a rpi °
in the Regular Army. There are now
111,000 of them - the permitted
maximum is 123,000. .
This shadow army is organised region-
ally m units based on a local drill hall,
which like the church and the pub is
part of the traditional apparatus of a
British community. Forty times a year,
the Territorials will spend an evening
here learning about weapons and equip-
ment, doing a little drill, listening to a
lecture. And most of them go to an
annual camp for 15 days.
A new and more exotic g rou P has been
created within this army. It is the Terri-
torial Army Emergency Reserve - the
“ever-readies” to the newspapers. This
provides a pool of fully-trained soldiers
who, on the discretion of the War
Minister, can be plucked out of civilian
life and sent to make up the numbers
of a regular unit in an emergency.
Their training requirements are more
stringent, and for their year of contracted
service they get a bonus of £l5O. The
response has not been great. There are
about 4,500 of them.
The Territorials are earmarked to pro-
vide reinforcements for the Regulars—
particularly for the Army of the Rhine.
They can only be sent overseas by the
ponderous ritual of a Royal Proclamation
and that would mean that war was
promised.
It is a little odd in a disillusioned, cyn-
ical Britain to find so flourishing a vol-
unteer group engaged in so unfashionable
a form of service. They come to it for
many reasons. The pay is the least of
these. Some do it for the moral reason
that they feel they owe the State some
service. Some are lonely or gregarious
and enjoy the social side, the fried sup-
pers after the drill, the adjournment to
the bar, the easy company and the pro-
longation of youth.
They are a fair cross-section. There
are sober clerks and youths in pointed
shoes; there are sturdy laborers and
squires, would-be gentry, young business-
men, bus-drivers, motorcycle fanatics.
They present no disciplinary problems.
At the end of their camps, their units
are almost as good as regular units. They
may have lost the endearing light-
heartedness. They have found a new
purpose and they are all volunteers.

“THE RELUCTANT OFFICERS”
Sir,
I am a Regular Army officer. But,
unlike your correspondent “Army Offi-
cer” (8/2/64), I am happy in the service.
The pay is most adequate, promotion is
excellent, facilities are satisfactory, and
I cannot visualise any other form of
employment which would so happily
fulfil my needs for many years to come.
But I also am a contributor to the
High Court fund. My reason for sup-
porting the fund is not that I myself
wish to resign, nor least of all that I
should wish to weaken the Staff Corps
at a time when numerical strength is
quite vital. But this is quite clearly a
matter of principle. When I went to
Duntroon as a boy of seventeen I clearly
understood when I took my oath of fealty
that I was bound for five years, and then
on being commissioned it was quite clear
that, Australia not being at war, I could
resign my commission on three months’
notice. I further realised that I had a
moral obligation to repay by service
what the Commonwealth had given me
at Duntroon and, later, overseas.
But now the Military Board, without
recourse to Cabinet, has declared that the
State has the use of my services for my
entire working life. I am a free man,
and I will not be a slave to the State.
This is quite simply tyranny.
The Military Board has, I am sure,
considered the matter at great length.
It is concerned at the prospect of officers
leaving the service. It has a very great
responsibility to the Government regard-
ing the defence of the country, and no
doubt feels it would be failing in its
duty in allowing the officer strength to
fall below its present level. But this is
not the way to keep that strength.
No civil firm would dream of forbid-
ding its employees to resign; a valued
employee being lured away by better
pay or conditions elsewhere can expect
his resignation to be countered by a
rise or perhaps a promotion or, mayhap,
both.
The Military Board has acted not only
ill-advisedly, not only unwisely, but, in-
deed, quite tyrannically, and completely
contrary to the democratic way of life
that has been the basis of our Australian
civilisation.
“MAJOR”
Puckapunyal (Vic.).
Sir,
Your article, “The Curious Case of
the Reluctant Officers” (18/1/64), has
drawn attention to a shocking injustice
existing in our community. The recent
Military Board decision not to release
officers who, due to either urgent family
reasons or disillusionment with service
life, have resigned their commissions is
a complete negation of human rights.
Neither the officer’s reason for leaving
nor the effect his release might have on
the Army should be allowed to affect
the right of a free citizen in a free
country to exercise his democratic right
of changing his occupation.
Persons in every walk of life are
changing their jobs daily; even the poor
private soldier can change his mind
every three or six years when his term
is up. This freedom, however, no longer
applies to Army officers, the bulk of
whom were brought into the Army under
false pretences when still in their teens.
It was not until the promulgation of the
Board’s decision, when the trap was shut,
that they realised they were in until the
Army no longer required them at the
age of 47.
Whatever the decision of the High
Court next month, it is our Government’s
duty to clean up by legislation this
scandal in our midst.

JAPANESE YOUTH
Sir,
Bill Beecham’s report (16/11/63) of
the liberal treatment accorded in Japan
to torrid movie posters and daybills
which would be taboo in Australia, and
his opinion that “there is little if any
evidence of delinquency, either juvenile
or otherwise, as a result”, is not the
whole picture.
For years housewives’ associations,
educationalists, and police authorities
have been alarmed at the growing men-
ace of juvenile delinquency in Japan,
and have been pressing for some effective
form of censorship over movies and
movie posters. With the approach of
the Olympics their efforts are beginning
to meet with success. The Government
is moving in to clean up Tokyo by ban-
ning sex shows in movies, on posters,
and in the flesh.
Japanese newspapers of 25/1/64 re-
port the Kyoto municipal authorities
have proposed to the Juvenile Problems
Conference measures for legislation
against obscene signboards and posters
which are exerting a bad influence on
youth; even such Christmas posters as
those which recently appeared depicting
a stout jolly Santa Claus flanked by two
nude women. The Shiga Prefectural
authorities have since gone further in
suggesting more sweeping measures to
meet juvenile delinquency —namely, a
curfew against children being out late
at night, and measures to prohibit
juveniles of from 6 to 18 visiting pawn-
brokers, moneylenders, or putting up at
hotels.

THE ROBINSON HANGING
Sir,
Your story (1/2/64) about the Robin-
son hanging contained many surprises.
The execution got more than “a few
paragraphs” in the eastern Press: “The
Sydney Morning Herald” had a long
page one story, the Sydney “Sun” de-
voted all its front-page to it, and the
“Mirror” treated it boldly and at length
in page two. Both the Sydney evenings
had published a lot of stories earlier.
Constable lies did not “attempt to
intervene in an argument between Robin-
son and his father”. The only thing he
attempted was to walk towards the gate
of the Robinson house, to which he had
been summoned by telephone. Robinson
junior shot him from a window, then
ran to him, kicked him over and shot
him again. The other victim was shot
when Robinson tried to take over a car.

None of the facts about Robinson’s
background and supposed mental con-
dition was concealed. They were ex-
haustively discussed at the trial and fully
reported in the newspapers. The defence
did not rest its case on a plea of in-
sanity, and the only psychiatrist to exa-
mine Robinson gave evidence he was
sane. The general defence contention
was that Robinson shot the policeman
the first time by accident, then panicked
and was not responsible for his later
murder and other actions.
The truth makes nonsense of the sen-
tence: “What these undisclosed facts do
is to give very strong support to the
defence that Robinson was mentally
ill”.
The whole article suggests that jus-
tice was carelessly and cruelly adminis-
tered in the WA Criminal Court. That
may make an interesting story, but it is
dead wrong, whether the hanging itself
was wrong or right.

COMMUNISM IN INDONESIA
Sir,
Dr Knopfelmacher’s quotation of
sources (25/1/64) seems to require a
further qualification and critical analysis.
(1) To quote anyone from the “New
Statesman” in 1962 when the “New
Statesman’s” Indonesian friends were
the leaders of the Partai Sosialis Indo-
nesia, who supplied the brains and the
organisational skill for the “colonels’ ”
uprising in 1957 and who then met their
final defeat at the hands of Djakarta
—means either a complete ignorance of
the background of the article or a con-
scious agreement with it in attempting
to shift the blame for the misery of the
country from the culprits, the defeated
rebels.
(2) If the figures in Dr Knopfel-
macher’s letter are properly quoted
not out of context —then, I am afraid,
the ANU’s prestige is insufficient to
prevent me from correcting the im-
pression they seem to convey. Taking
the largest figures: with respect to the
rapid increase in the membership of the
Indonesian Peasant Organisation (may
one assume that here the Barisan Tani is
meant?) it should be borne in mind that
before the confiscation of all Dutch
property in 1957, all the agricultural
estates of note were in non-Indonesian
hands. Any national movement to
organise the Indonesian agricultural
workers and small-holders would there-
fore automatically be directed against
“capital”— but not Indonesian capital.
To abstain, or refrain from joining,
meant for Indonesians living on the
land a denial of national identity, and
not the embracing of a specific political
ideology. Certainly such a membership
did not mean for the tani the adopting
of dialectic materialism—which he cer-
tainly would never have understood.
The PKI youth organisation—similarly
to the other Pemuda organisations—is
not and was not an internationalist, but
a chauvinistic, movement, with the
usual anti-colonial and therefore anti-
capitalistic overtones. Unless Dr Knop-
felmacher is prepared to admit that the
people of Indonesia are expected to
jump without option from the
colonial-feudalism of yesteryear without
transition into an experimental type of
national-socialistic economy, he will
never be able to appreciate the true
background of political forces operating
in Indonesia, nor correctly interpret
personalities and events.
Lastly, I agree with Dr Knopfel-

THE ORR CASE
Sir,
Janet Anderson (8/2/64) describes
Professor Orr as “a man who was in-
strumental in having a Royal Commission
inquire into the way the university was
run a Commission which, moreover,
piling insult on injury, found that the
criticisms of Professor Orr were entirely
justified”. That is quite untrue.
I was a member of the University
Council at the time, and, as far as I am
aware, the only criticisms made by Pro-
fessor Orr were those in his letter of
October 29, 1954. At all events it is
his authorship of this document which,
incidentally, was also signed by 35 other
members of the staff —which gains him
his only mention in the Commission’s
report.
That letter was general in nature, and
may be summed up in the sentence: “It
is self-evident that the Council of the
University of Tasmania, as a result of
apathy, neglect, and maladministration
over recent years, has failed completely
to discharge its most vital duty to the
Government and people of Tasmania of
maintaining the traditional ideals of and
essential prerequisites for a university”.
The Commission summed up its find-
ings on page 54 of its report: “We find
little wrong with the present University
that cannot be put right within a few
years, if a spirit of commonsense and
co-operation is allowed to prevail. Many
of our criticisms can be met by simple
internal changes, others by appropriate
amendments to the University Act.
There remains, however, one serious
deficiency that of buildings . . .”
It is to be noted that the suggested
remedy for the matters criticised is not
zeal or attention to duty by the Council,
but internal changes and statutory
amendment.
If Miss Anderson goes further, and
attributes to Professor Orr a share in the
detailed charges put before the Commis-
sion by the staff, the following quota-
tions from the report are of interest:
“The Staff Association case was, in
detail, answered at most points”. (Page
7.)
“Many of the criticisms levelled at the
Council were in fact without foundation
or greatly exaggerated.” (Page 9.)
“We feel that a full-scale enquiry,
with its attendant bitterness and ill-
feeling, would perhaps have been avoided
if the Staff Association had been more
temperate in its approach to Council
and the public ... In order to attempt
to substantiate and particularise its
grievances, it made some accusations
which could not stand up to detailed in-
vestigation, and a number of statements
which proved to be inaccurate”. (Page
38.)
It was in the light of that report that
the University set about putting things
right.
To represent that state of affairs as
one in which the Council, smarting under
a sense of “insult” piled upon “injury”
as a result of “entirely justified” criti-
cisms, set out to get rid of the man who
happened to be "the author of a letter
signed and released by 36 members of
staff, is simply to ignore the facts.
Such statements have been freely made
by persons who have obviously not read
the documents and have added greatly
to the difficulties both of Council and
staff in the development of the Univer-
sity.

PREFERENTIAL VOTING
Sir,
No candidate is elected to Parliament
without a majority of votes, whether
they be primary or preferential. Con-
sequently it is difficult to agree with
Craster Usher (25/1/64) that “figures
for the 1961 and 1963 elections for the
House of Representatives clearly show
the return of a minority vote govern-
ment in each case”.
Preferential voting really means that,
when I vote in order for candidates
Smith, Jones and Black, I indicate that
I favor Smith, and then that I prefer
Jones to Black. First past the post
voting is really suitable when there are
only two candidates.
Mr Usher does not define “donkey
votes”. It is an interesting term meaning
many things to many people. Perhaps
he means a vote that is numbered con-
secutively from top to bottom of the bal-
lot paper, irrespective of the political
belief or allegiance of the voter. If this
defines the “donkey vote”, 1963 election
studies indicate it is probably less than
1 per cent and almost certainly has no
appreciable effect on election results.

Men of Jazz
Dixieland with a Melbourne accent
By TOM PICKERING
A recently released record has caused
me to wonder if there is such a
thing as a recognisable Australian way
of playing jazz. After nearly thirty years
it may seem reasonable to expect some
sort of original contribution. But when
one considers that the contribution of
white American musicians has been only
in terms of technique and personality,
it is hardly likely that Australian jazz-
men, cut off from all but the briefest
personal contact, are going to accomplish
any more. When one also considers
that 99 per cent of Australian musicians
play jazz only as a hobby, they do what
they do extremely well and, indeed, the
playing of the best of them has a dis-
tinctive flavor that could well be called
Australian.
The record referred to is a W & G
long-player by Roger Bell and his Pagan
Pipers. Enclosed in a colorful envelope
depicting the leader (complete with deer-
stalker) and a wombat are 12 intelli-
gently chosen tunes played by a veteran
crew of Melbourne jazzmen who, with
two exceptions, were present at the First
Australian Jazz Convention 18 years ago.
Roger Bell is the trumpet-playing
brother of the more widely-known
Graeme Bell with whose original band
he participated in two overseas tours
and made numerous records. Roger,
perhaps more than any other Australian
jazzman, has developed a completely
personal sound on his instrument.
Although influenced (like all jazz brass
men) by Armstrong and perhaps Bix
Beiderbecke and Max Kaminsky, his
style is immediately recognisable and
possesses a jaunty, strutting quality
ideally suited to supplying the lead for
a Dixieland group. It is an infectious,
happy sound and nobody can drive a
band as can Roger when feeling right;
his proclivity for whipping a tiring group
into extra ensemble choruses is justly
famed.
This particular record also features
Bell in two other roles, those of vocalist
and composer. Unlike most non-Ameri-
cans attempting to sing jazz, he does
not ape the Negro (except for the idiom)
but retains his priceless Melbourne
accent. He happily shouts his way
through “When you’re smilin’ ”, “It’s
right here for you”, “Ain’t it a shame
about Marne?”, “You rascal, you!”,
and a pip of a Dixie number about a
philandering railroad man called Dapper
Dan learned, so the sleeve notes say,
from an aged performer in London.
Three of Roger’s own tunes are heard,
their titles exemplifying the off-beat
humor common to most of the jazz
fraternity: “The Onion-bender’s Lament”,
“Honi Soit Qui Mallee Root”, and “The
Wombat”.
The last-named, which was also issued
as a single, has, strangely enough,
become a hit on the teenage parades.
I may be wrong but I believe this is the
first time an Australian-composed jazz
tune has invaded the twang and twaddle
of the Top Umpty.
“THhe Wombat” is typical of Roger’s
tunesmithing and, like his other
originals, shows the influence of Kerry
Mills (writer of “Ragtime Dance”,
“Smokey Mokes”, and the old Bell band
theme “At a Georgia Camp Meeting”)
and other composers of Ragtime. Bell’s
tunes are always melodically pleasing and
usually consist of two or more parts,
sometimes involving a key-change. This
indebtedness to the Ragtime Era seems
to be widespread amongst Australian
composers of traditional jazz; the past
work of Graeme Bell, Ade Monsbourgh,
and Adelaide's Dave Dallwitz has fre-
quently betrayed the same influence.
An equally talented member of the
Pagan Pipers is the Adrian Monsbourgh
just mentioned, the “Lazy Ade” of many
“Backroom” and “Late Hour” sessions.
Ade is thought of by many as the
“Father” of Australian jazz and certainly
he is the most natural jazzman we have
produced. His instruments (and he can
play anything you care to name with
equal disregard for their difficulty of
execution) are held together to rubber
bands, adhesive tape and will-power,
but on all of them he expresses himself
with an intensity one only expects from
an American Negro of the old school.
An extraordinary empathy has
developed between Bell and Monsbourgh
during their long association (over 25
years) and this is nostalgically demon-
strated in the ensemble choruses of
“After I say I'm sorry”. Ade’s clarinet
solo on the same piece is a real heart-
breaker.
Over-shadowed a little by the two
older front-line men is clarinetist Nevil
Striblirig who, nevertheless, adds con-
siderably to the excitement of the en-
sembles as well as contributing some
fine solos in typical Melbourne clarinet
style.
The success of any jazz performance
depends on the quality of the rhythm
section; it can affect the front - line
product more than most people realise.
Roger Bell could hardly have chosen
a stronger team from the talent available.
Rex Green (piano), Jack Varney (guitar),
Lou Silbereisen (bass), Peter Cleaver
(banjo) and Len Barnard (drums)
combine to provide an irresistible beat
and a correct harmonic background.
Varney and Silbereisen are two more
ex-members of the first Graeme Bell
band while Peter Cleaver belongs to a
younger generation. Tasmanian-born Rex
Green, who began his jazz career with
Hobart’s Barrelhouse Four, shares solo
honors with Bell and Monsbourgh as
well as providing two-fisted rhythm. His
is a distinctive, hard-hitting style derived
from Earl Hines as evident here on such
numbers as “It’s right here for you”
and Pee Wee Russell's “What’s the
Pitch?”.
Much of the session’s liveliness is due
to the drumming of Len Barnard who,
besides supplying a swinging beat, dis-
plays imagination, understanding and an
ever-present sense of humor. He and his
brother Bob (now playing trumpet with
the Graeme Bell All Stars in Sydney)
are two of Australia’s most talented
musicians. Bob often sounds more like
Armstrong did than Louis himself does
now and Len is equally at home in any
type of band. Both are full-time pro-
fessionals and capable of playing this
type of music with any band in the
world. A record released last year under
Len’s name (“The Naked Dance”
MCA) was as impressive in its own
way as the one under discussion.
On several tracks Len accentuates the
individual sound of the Pagan Pipers
by abandoning his drums for the humble
washboard. Washboard-beating (which
involves the tapping and stroking with
thimble-tipped fingers the corrugations
of an old-fashioned tin washboard) is
as old as jazz and was used extensively
by obscure Negro bands in the Twenties
and early Thirties. Although som«
legitimate instruments were used, what
made these groups unique was the
employment of such home-made
makers as the jug, the comb-and-papeir
kazoo, the harmonica, and the wash-


board. The music they produced, though
uninhibited and crude, was immensely
spirited and very close to jazz roots.
Perhaps because of the freedom and
comparative simplicity of this music,
the influence of these Washboard and
Jug bands has been stronger in Aus-
tralia than anywl ere else. Roger Bell
himself is an expert on washboard and
has enlivened many sessions organised
by this type of music’s chief protagonist,
Ade Monsbourgh.
It appears to me that Roger Bell,
like the rest of us veterans of Aus-
tralian jazz, has had the feeling that
tempus is fugiting and wanted to record
something of lasting worth before it
became too late. Unlike most of us, he
has done something about it. A year’s
thought has gone into this recording
which took just one afternoon to make
and this careful preparation combined
with the enthusiasm of his chosen group
has produced a record which stands up
wonderfully to repeated playings (the
real test) and represents for me the
peak of Australian recorded jazz.
It may have been intended as a sort
of hot swan song but it could easily
prove to be a new beginning.

ffkrE “Black Theatre of Prague” is a
theatre of illusion in which objects
take on a life of their own. On a
darkened stage the illusionists, invisible
in black velvet, manipulate objects which
dance in the pale glow of ultra-violet
spotlights.
The nine short sketches range from
the nightmare to the idyllic. The two
or three actors in each sketch seem more
like puppets on strings than the lively
objects which fascinate or delight the
eye. While young lovers on a park bench
shyly avoid each other, their umbrellas
dance and court. A fisherman sits
motionless in his boat while fish, un-
seen by him, swim and dart beneath. A
sewing machine moves its head like a
restless horse; an old-fashioned camera
suddenly shoots out like an elephant’s
trunk and releases flocks of dicky-birds
at the startled sitters; menacing sticks
beat and pursue in a nightmare world.
Puppetry and mime, music, lighting
and costume all combine to produce a
dazzling display of technical skill. But
the “visions” of Mr Jiri Srnec, creator of
the “Black Theatre,” seem to me to lack
dramatic interest. The contrast between
the liveliness of objects, made possible
by this “Black Magic”, and object-like
human beings, offers wonderful possi-
bilities for farce. But Mr Srnec does not
exploit this idea of an upside-down
world, although some such idea would
give a much - needed unity to the
assorted sketches.
For many years people have been
lamenting the decline of the music hall.
In “The Entertainer” John Osborne
wrote what appeared to be the swan-
song of the vaudeville comedian and
the England in which he had flourished.
But now Anthony Newley has produced
an unusual, distinctively English musical
by drawing on the traditions and skills
of the English vaudeville theatre.
“Stop The World” is the story of
Littlechap, who starts life as a tea-boy
in a factory and finishes up as Lord
Littlechap of Sludgepool. Like the hero
of “Room at the Top”, he rises through
his marriage to the boss’s daughter. Evie
seems “different” at first, but Littlechap
soon becomes disenchanted with marriage
(“nag, nag, nag”) and turns to other
women. There is Anya, the football-play-
ing Russian; Use, the German au. pair
girl; and Ginny, the American night-
club singer. They are all “different”, but
they are all Evie. Played with delightful
versatility by Evelyn Page, each one has
her own satiric song “typically
English”, “glorious Russian”, “typische
Deutsche”, “All-American”.
Jackie Warner as Littlechap, with his
white clown’s face, is the traditional
music-hall comedian: The little man,
alternately sad and cocky, with his
lower-class accent, his down - to - earth
humor and his irreverent attitude to the
rich and powerful. The attitudes are
traditional, but the songs and comedian’s
patter are topical (with even a few local
Australian references). Best of all are
Littlechap’s election speeches as a
member of the Opportunist Party, which
all begin, “Mumbo, Jumbo, Rhubarb,
Rhubarb”.
Although the content of “Stop The
World” is lively, it is not particularly
original and does not rise above the
level of first-class revue. What is really
outstanding about this musical is its
style. Here is no singing spectacular,
no lavish display of costumes and ever-
changing sets. The production, by John
Broome, is spare, simple and taut as a
bowstring. Art replaces display. The
single set represents a circus tent, in
which rows of wooden bleachers
surround the arena where Jackie Warner
enacts the lift of life of Littlechap from
cradle to grave. Instead of using props,
both comedian and chorus create a
world with the art of mime. The eight-
girl chorus, dressed in Picasso-inspired
harlequin costumes, represent everything
from bored factory girls to the Ladies’
Book of the Month Luncheon Club. All
their movements have the grace and
trained precision of circus performers.
Throughout the whole there is not a
word nor a movement that is not
relevant to the story of Littlechap.
The ingredients of the comedy “Bare-
foot in the Park” are a newly-married
couple (Paul and Corie Bratter), the
bride’s mother, a comic foreign gentle-
man (Mr. Velasco), and a New York
apartment at the top of six flights of
stairs, with broken skylights through
which the snowflakes drift.
I suppose the chief fascination of a
play like this is that it shows how other
people live. Having been in the United
States recently, I can testify to the
accuracy of “Barefoot in the Park”.
Elaborate traditional decor, even in an
attic (as in “Home Beautiful” we are
able to see the attic before and after.
At first bare and unpromising, it is
transformed by Act II into a vision in
cream and gold which brought delighted
gasps from the ladies in the audience).
Very strong martinis before dinner: no
wonder Corie’s mother has to take pink
pills. Charming, high-spirited young
women and charming, clean-cut young
men. Enormous telephone mechanics
with tiny, high voices, who come to instal
your ’phone. Add to this lively dialogue
—also realistic, for young New Yorkers
are fast-thinking and witty and the
very lifelike acting of a talented cast.

Pringle himself introduced the pro-

there was a disconcerting formality. It
rarely sought out the incidental detail
that makes documentary more direct,
while still preserving its authority.
The whole of the half hour was de-
voted to a filmed coverage of the Borneo
border dispute. The precise and un-
emotional reporting of Richard Croll
pointed to the very real Indonesian
threat in Borneo. From his interviews
with the British district officers (all de-
ceptively precious-sounding young men,
particularly a boyish Captain Holsworthy
who several times asserted his faith in a
“tot of rum” to boost morale, dispel
fatigue, improve the cooking or ease the
wounded) it was apparent that the internal
subversion and external 'aggression have
grown to dangerous proportions there.
Perhaps by its very nature a detailed
report on a localised trouble-spot ex-
aggerates its dimensions, for in the light
of all such investigations the tensions
in the world at large somehow pale into
lesser significance. As it was, the “Seven
Days” report, though at all times eco-
nomical and doubtless accurate, seemed
sensationalist. This is not to belittle the
danger in Borneo. On the contrary, it is
obviously a critical situation, but by iso-
lating it rather than placing it in a wider
international context, the “Seven Days”
team’s approach in fact tended to lessen
its importance, in the same way that
caricature is more immediately effective
but ultimately has less impact than con-
trolled characterization.
“Seven Days” is not a summary of the
major events of the week, nor even the
major events relating specifically to Aus-
tralia, as the Borneo dispute does. Nor
is it trying to emulate “Four Corners”.
The first programme cannot be criticised
for choosing to treat only one current
issue. For within a half-hour it would be
impossible to pay adequate attention to
all that has happened, and selection is
therefore necessary. The selection though
is arbitrary, and so is the attitude. If
Pringle chose a fitting subject, and he
did, he did not treat it as impartially as
one might have hoped. While his point
of view should be evident, he should not
ignore any other.

FILMS
Bardot’s Rebirth
The Warrior’s Rest. Director, Roger
Vadim. Victory Theatre. Sydney.
\ most puzzling director, Roger Vadim
has been making films for several
years, and one would expect that,
whatever other faults he might have, he
would be thoroughly competent. Yet
time and again he displays a strangely
amateurish approach. Fitful flashes of
brilliance illumine work that is tentative,
almost groping. He seems less like a
professional film maker than a gifted but
untrained dilettante.
Vadim is often regarded simply (if not
purely) as the discoverer of Brigitte Bar-
dot, who was first displayed in “And God
Created Woman”, the film which estab-
lished them both as names in 1956.
Apart from the director’s loving exami-
nation of Mademoiselle Bardot's admit-
tedly spectacular attributes, the film had
little to recommend it except Vadim’s
inventive but undisciplined use of camera
and a certain flair for telling a story.
The tantalising hints of an impressive
talent were apparently realised in Vadim’s
“Les Liaisons Dangereuses, 1959”. Some
critics hailed this as a most stylish and
authoritative piece of film-making, but
it has had only a verylimited release:
censors undismayed by the prurient
vulgarity of the early Bardot films
apparently balked at the witty, passion-
less amorality of this calm dissection of
the cynical corruption of innocence.
In ‘‘Le Repos du Guerrier” Vadim
again stars Bardot, and, although still
obsessed by her mere appearance, he has
for the first time treated her as a human
being rather than a sex symbol. Previous-
ly, her personality rather than her
physical appeal had only been exploited
by Boisrond (‘‘La Parisienne”) and Malle
(“La Vie Privee”). For once, Vadim
lets Brigitte Bardot impress not simply
as a hot bundle but as a warm and living
person in this story of a conventional
French girl whose well-ordered life is
disrupted by her meeting with a would-be
suicide.
The film (basically an exposition of
the axiom that no man is an island) is a
sometimes absorbing study of human
relationships. But again Vadim’s amateur-
ism often dissipates its intrinsic interest.
He uses his directing technique like a
child playing with a new toy par-
ticularly in the seemingly interminable
studio party sequence, full of camera-
work that is unusual, experimental and
totally meaningless.

Inside the Labyrinth
The tragic world of Angus Wilson
By VIVIAN SMITH
The Wild Garden or Speaking of
Writing. Angus Wilson. Seeker &
Warburg. 20s.
A few years ago Angus Wilson was
in vogue and it was fashionable to
have read his stories and novels. With
“Anglo-Saxon Attitudes” he reached a
peak of popularity. Then came his
masterpiece, “The Middle Age of Mrs
Eliot” and two years ago “The Old Men
At the Zoo”. Mr Wilson had turned
serious and sombre always a sin to
the English and, as far as one can
judge from this distance, his popularity
seemed to decline. So much so in fact
that Evelyn Waugh felt impelled to write
to the “Spectator” in dismay at the mis-
understanding of Wilson’s novels and
at the lack of perception with which
“The Old Men At the Zoo” was received.
Wilson’s early popularity arose from
the fact that he was the first writer
to observe closely and precisely the
enormous and sudden changes in the
English social scene since 1939. This
“mild social revolution” formed the back-
ground of his early stories and novels
and it was this aspect of his work which
ssemed to appeal most and to which
his early readers and critics responded.
At last the decor was different; it was
fresh and recognisable. Here was some-
body writing about the changing attitudes
of post-war England, the Welfare State,
fixing the new snobberies, noting the
different mores. His novels and stories
were densely populated with types which
had never appeared in English fiction
before: the new “impoverished” aristo-
crats, students on “learn-the-language”
holidays, sugar-daddies, male prostitutes
. . . He earned a reputation as a “social
satirist” and was admired for his
“placing” of many things in the new
English society that had not yet been
written about. The titles of his books
became catchwords. His influence has
been enormous and writers as different
as Francis King and Graham Greene
clearly show signs of being indebted to
his work: his revival of the comedy
of repetition, his way of treating the
stock character . . . Important as all
this was, it did not take into account
the deep psychic solitude and tension
at the heart of Wilson’s work, the rest-
less disturbing intelligence, the masterly
shapeliness of his novels, with their rich,
lucid and intricate structure, their con-
stant probing of the main questions
which confront the modern humanist,
the way they deal with the complex
struggle in man of creative and destruc-
tive forces.
Mr Wilson’s new short book, “The
Wild Garden”, is based on the Ewing
lectures he gave at the University of
California in 1960. The purpose of these
lectures is to induce writers to speak
on their craft and their attitudes and
ideas about their own creative work.
Writers are generally considered unre-
liable commentators on their own work:
“Never trust the artist, trust the tale” is
now a very fashionable tag. And yet,
what writers have to say about their
own work is usually of more value
and interest than what most critics have
to offer; the writers may not always be
right, but at least they have earned the
right to say what they say. The value
of Wilson’s book lies not only in its
comments on his own complex imagina-
tive world and on the process of creation,
but in the light it helps to throw on
many of the unquestioned orthodoxies
of modern criticism itself and on some
of the issues which it so resolutely
ignores.
Wilson is concerned with the way in
which reality is transformed into fiction;
and the way this fictional pattern
becomes a means of interpreting and
understanding the experience on which
it was based.
VI/'ilson was the youngest son of a
"" declining middle-class family, and
his childhood was lived in small hotels
and boarding-houses. He quickly dis-
covered that he could get along well with
everyone by exerting charm, by enter-
taining, by clowning, by easily adapting
himself to others, and by building around
himself a self-protecting fantasy world.
His life seems to have moved along com-
fortably enough, from Westminster
school, through Oxford to the British
Museum Library, until he had to face
a major crisis in his life. Despair and
sheer unhappiness forced him to self-
knowledge. He saw the collapse of the
early patterns of his life, the destruction
of the false securities with which he had
protected himself: “In all quarters, with
the community, in love, with so-called
inanimate nature, I found an impossibility
of communication, the more desperate
because on all three fronts I glimpsed
at moments some coherences that it
seemed quite out of my power to re-
discover at will” . . . “Defeat,” he
writes, “forced me to rearrange my
experience of life in imaginative terms,
to try to make sense by making fictional
patterns”.
From this experience emerged Wilson’s
desire to attack, in his early stories,
the falsity of preserved innocence and
ignorance—a major theme throughout
his work and his deep hostility to
cherished illusions, especially in the
political sphere. His examination of his
well-known story “Raspberry Jam”
shows how far ahead of his own compre-
hension of himself his story was at the
time of its writing: but then works of
art usually know more than the artist
-—and what is more, show it to other
people.
The world of Wilson’s novels is a
deeply divided world. His characters,
like Conrad’s, are caught between society
and solitude, between isolation and
solidarity. “Throughout my novels”, he
writes, “the dichotomy is the same: the
cocktail parties, Christmas dinners and
social functions still represent the hell
of the human failure to communicate
(a sort of blasphemy against life, mock-
ing a communion feast); here the damned
are the social climbers, those wanting
to be loved, the unloved women who
push people around, the organisation
men who fall to pieces when they are
alone; the solitary walks and the
meaningless reveries represent the
opposed hell of the maze of self-pity
and neurosis”.
The central figures of all of his novels,
Bernard Sands in “Hemlock and After”,
Gerald Middleton in “Anglo-Saxon
Attitudes”, Meg Eliot in “The Middle
Age of Mrs Eliot” and Simon Carter
in “The Old Men At the Zoo”, oscillate
in search of their real selves between
these magnificently furnished twin hells.
It is in certain senses—the suggestion
is Wilson’s own a manic depressive
world, conveying in brilliant novelistic
terms an image of modern man’s un-
steady, fluctuating, tightrope existence.
The most fascinating pages of this
book are those concerned with the
atmosphere of Wilson’s novels, the
particular flavor and quality given to
a writer’s work by recurring subjects,
symbols and places. Proust was pre-
occupied with this aspect of a writer’s
work, as was Flaubert before him. The
ability to notice and comment on such
features is certainly the test of a critic’s
real knowledge of a writer’s aims and
intentions; and a reader’s familiarity
with and admiration for a particular
writer can be measured by his aware-
ness and identification of these highly
individual elements. Those familiar with


Wilson’s work will find illuminating his
comments on his complex use of images
of flowers and gardens, and animals and
zoos. The latter preoccupation he traces
back to his childhood love of animal
fables, animal stories and natural history
books, an image which is beautifully
deployed and developed in his superb
novel, “The Old Men At the Zoo”. The
importance of man’s relation to the
creature world (“the centre of my most
happy sense of beauty, and of hopeful
mystery”) and of this relation as an
indication of his sense of the world,
is fundamental to Wilson’s vision, and
part of the “black” quality of “The Old
Men At the Zoo” comes from its view
of our future world slowly and ruthlessly
destroying its natural resources, its
animals, insects and plants; of man’s
growing alienation from the natural
world and from the instinctive and spon-
taneous life.
Elsewhere, briefly, he comments on
the image of the sea in his writings and
traces his fears of ice-wastes to child-
hood anxieties. “My horror of Polar
seas came early in a picture of Golli-
wog’s head appearing above the ice,
entitled ‘Golliwog at the North Pole’.
And since then I have read all accounts
of Polar expeditions—particularly Scott’s
last voyage—as others may read about
psychopathic murders or the horrors of
the supernatural”. Which makes one
wonder just what was in Wilson’s un-
conscious when in “The Old Men At
the Zoo” he sent Princess Anne on a
tour of the Antarctic —but by then, of
course, it had been reclaimed from the
ice!
None of Wilson’s preferred symbols,
images or places has a fixed static
meaning. The country, like the garden,
can be associated with peace, order,
contemplation or with snobbery, stulti-
fying quietism, complacency or sterile
self-sufficiency. Wilson’s discussion of
the way these symbols may change
throughout his work throws light not
only on a novelist's unconscious pro-
cesses, but indeed on the nature of
imagination itself.
Towards the end of this book Wilson
comments on the mixture of fantasy
and realism in his work (one of its most
striking features) and the attitude to
this mixture of two of his best critics:
Raymond Williams and Frank Kermode.
Williams has criticised Wilson for factual
mistakes in his work; Kermode, who
has always shown a personal predilection
for mytho-poetic novels like William
Golding’s, for an excessive concern with
“reality”. Wilson’s reply is that in
writing novels he has never been able
to place much importance upon the
distinction between real and imagined
—“A novelist”, he says, “makes as
much or as little use of the real world
as he needs to project his vision of
life ... I have never felt called upon
to declare allegiance to either fantasy
or realism. They proceed from two
different levels of my imagination and
without their fusion I could not produce
a novel”.
He concludes by saying that there
is no final explanation for the making
of a novel and though the novel is a
less pure form than painting or music
•—it acquires so many additional signifi-
cances, social, psychological, moral —it,
too, at its most perfect, shares in the
final mystery of art. With his characteris-
tic integrity and refusal to make extrava-
gant claims Wilson says, “I should wish
to end this book by registering my own
experience that the impulse to write a
novel comes from a momentary unified
vision of life”.
This glance at his own work in mid-
career will be welcomed by admirers
of Wilson’s fiction for its comments on
his novels and stories, for the magnificent
sketch of his father, for the account
of his first visit to South Africa. Valu-
able, too, are its incidental apercus:
“Among a great part of the less distin-
guished serious English novelists today
(there is) a confusion between novel
writing and sociology for which perhaps
they would have been better suited”; or
again: “The thematic novel, even at its
most excellent, say in ‘Silas Marner’ or
‘L’Entranger’, seems to me somewhat to
evade the basic purpose of the novel.
Such novels, it is true, make one feel
what it is to be a miser or a dissociated
man, they expand the personal conviction
in a way that an essay on the theme
could not do. Yet there is still wanting
that sense of being made fully alive, of
disseminating the moral proposition so
completely in a mass of living experience
that it is never directly sensed as you
read but only apprehended at the end
as a result of the life you have shared
in the book. This is the real challenge
and triumph of the novel and, however
excellent, short thematic novels seem
to me to evade it.”
Anniversary
The London Magazine. Editor, Alan
Ross. 6s.
“npHE London Magazine” reaches a
welcome 10th anniversary in its pre-
sent form. For some years edited by
John Lehmann, it is currently in the
hands of the poet and critic Alan Ross,
assisted by an Australian, Charles
Osborne. The editor’s interests are catho-
lic, the atmosphere of the magazine
cosmopolitan; the net is spread very wide
to include literatures from several coun-
tries (most notably Australia). The
range of contributors includes many of
the leading writers of the period, and
there are frequent discoveries of new
talent. Without quite having the inten-
sity of “Horizon” the magazine does in
many ways continue the Connolly tradi-
tion of civilised eclecticism. The insistence
on clear writing makes a happy contrast
with the mannered convolutions of the
London intellectual weeklies.
The excellent current issue contains
a new poem by W. H. Auden, a descrip-
tion of a meeting with Laura Riding
by Julian Symons (this is of rather
specialised interest), some posthumously
published poems by the admirable Ber-
nard Spencer and a valuable, but to my
taste rather too genial, piece on Kingsley
Amis by Bernard Bergonzi. James Price
provides an interesting recap (for the
non-specialist) of early Capra without,
unfortunately, making sufficient reference
to this director’s dazzling technical con-
trol of the film medium or to his highly
personal visual style.
C.H.
Inland Apostle
John Flynn, Apostle of the Inland.
W. Scott McPheat. Hodder and
Stoughton. 375. 6d.
Tohn Flynn would have been as much
** pleased with this new biography of
himself as he was dismayed by a previous
one written with a long pen dipped in
sensationalism many years ago.
The author, a young minister, has
shown that a writer does not need to
have resort to silly legend to produce an
arresting biographical tale.
McPheat is at the disadvantage that
he did not know the pre-war Red Centre
which, under the influence of air travel,
tourists and radio and the “bittamen”,
has acquired a suburban air. The old
Territory of the humming OT Line has
passed on with its basic features; the
long, lonely stretches of sandpad and
“bull dust,” and with its emphasis on
water and distances. No longer does the
hurtling traveller need to remember his
mileages to water with the names Ryan’s
Well, Powell’s Creek, Newcastle Waters,
Helen’s Springs, Tennant Creek, Alice
Springs, Bonny Well, so many miles
from each other, which the wayfarer
forgot only at his peril.
Flynn reached the Territory via a
series of progressive stages which are
striking. A long, gangling youth (we
shared something in common in that we
were both nicknamed “Spider” at school),
he was a natural but practical “religious”.
His early life in a comfortable home
in the environs of one of the older
goldfields of Victoria was influenced
by the death of a devoted mother during
his boyhood and the death of a brother
a little later.
Incidental hiking with a Bible class
and a cycling expedition which led him
to write his first newspaper articles about


the hardships of the selectors’ lives in
the Mallee were followed by a nearly
unavailing struggle with Greek and
Hebrew at the University, so that in
his own words they had “to let down
the sliprails to admit me because I
couldn't take the jump myself,” into the
Presbyterian ministry. Training with the
Shearers’ Mission led him nearer to his
goal.
His publication of the “Bushman’s
Companion” came almost contemporan-
eously with his occupation of the
“manse” at Beltana, South Australia, as
the youthful agent and apostle of the
Smith of Dunesk Mission, founded by
a daughter of Lord Chancellor Erskine.
This curious little book, now rarely en-
countered, advertised the nature of living
in Central Australia and the Far North.
It contained a medley of Bible selections,
hymns, a burial service and a children’s
service, first aid hints, directions for
making a will, a calendar, cash account,
postal information and solace for loneli-
ness in quotations from John Stuart
Mill, Bishop Butler and Bobbie Burns!
It took the bush by storm and formed
the entire library of many a lonely
home.
From Beltana and his mud-floored
tumble-down pise house, which he saw
for the first time early in February, 1911,
and which he told me once that he
shared for a time “with a very nice
snake”, he ranged the salt-bush country
with his medicines and his magic lantern,
his copies of the “Bushman’s Com-
panion”, his brush and curry comb and
chaff and hay for his two ancient horses,
Robin (aged 12) and Dodger (15).
This was the home country of
missionary work of the type which he
developed and modernised throughout
the Inland. He was not the first in the
field. Young Frank Rolland had been
the pioneer and the great and great-
hearted Mitchell had followed. But it
was Flynn who organised and opened
the first bush nursing home at Oodna-
datta on December 10, 1911, in 106
degrees and a storm. This put the coping
stone on Frank Rolland’s pioneer work
which had involved the appointment, in
1907, of Sister Main, who served the
route between Hergott Springs (Marree)
and Oodnadatta with medical care and
religion, until she gave place to the
fabulous Sister M. A. Latto Bett who,
in her old bailiwick, is as much a legend
as Flynn himself. From the Oodnadatta
Home she performed her duties without
help—endless medical tasks, extraction
of teeth, conduct of church services,
Sunday school and funerals, distribution
of books, befriending of strays, holding
of tea parties, running of a croquet
lawn.
To this era belonged Flynn’s opening
attack on the approaches to the Northern
Territory with his strange little sheet
“The Outback Battler”, forerunner of the
“Inlander” (the latter “edited on ‘The
Wallaby Track’ ”), and his fund-raising
with his “mile of threepences” to carry
him into his chosen country.
The urge towards the Territory had
been born of a letter from The
Bulletin’s grand old friend Jessie
Litchfield who had written from the
wild West Arm, eighty miles from
Darwin by land in June, 1909, of the
NT social condition of a territory
2000 miles long of 500,000 square miles,
with a town on one end, holding 1500
whites and 2000 Chinese. Of the whites,
she wrote, “fully 500 of the men keep
lubras or use them as they want them
and nearly all have half-caste illegitimate
children whose only future in life is
prostitution. There are not 50 Chinese
without lubras ... I know that drink,
drugs and lubras are responsible for
nine out of 10 hospital cases, and re-
sponsible for seven deaths out of 10.”
Jessie lived to see Flynn realise all her
ambitions.
story of Flynn’s crusade, which not
only brought into being the Flying
Doctor Service, pedal radio, religion and
contact with the outside world for the
NT, but did more than almost any other
influence to produce civilised develop-
ment and promote knowledge of the
Australian interior, is too long to tell
here even in broad outline. Today, just
a little more than 10 years after his
death, Flynn’s results are so vast and
comprehensive and various that it is
hard even to summarise them. The
Royal Flying Doctor Service alone has
1500 reporting stations connected to 13
bases. In one recent year, Broken Hill
base transmitted 40,000 telegrams to
outback settlers, flew over 72,000 miles
in answer to medical calls and gave
radio advice in over 4000 medical cases.
The changes in the equipment of religion
and social services are evident in the
beautiful Flynn Memorial Church with
its magnificent symbolism at which
thousands of tourists gape every year,
unremembering that only forty years
ago Alice Springs was a bleak flat hold-
ing less than a dozen whites and with a
camel-watering well in the heart of the
now busy town.
The accomplishments of Flynn were
the more remarkable because of the
nature of the man. He never became
a man of the bush. He did not wish
to be. His basic ambition was to weld
the isolated families into the “neighborly
fabric of life as it is lived in the rest
of Australia.” He never looked like a
bushman. He was apt to wear a waist-
coat with a watch-chain looped across it.
The tall, grey-clad figure, the mild,
strong, patient face were those of a
businessman. He bore so strong a re-
semblance to one of the chief managers
of a great Australian bank that it some-
times is startling to meet that financier
in the street. Indeed, a lot of Flynn’s
success was due to his skill in raising
money and using it economically. He
was not a horseman in the bushman’y
sense. He disliked camels, and no self-
respecting bull-camel in the old days
ever passed without trying to bite a
steak off him.
I first really came to know him after
I came back from leading the “Daily
Telegraph’s” motor party which made
the first double crossing of Australia
from Sydney to Darwin and back in
1924. He showed as little flair for motor
cars as for camels but the next year
he had a car in his service—a Dodge
“ute” to whose qualities and ancestry
only an accomplished bullock driver
could have done justice. He was just as
much on the ball with radio and with
flying and the controller of any innova-
tion which seemed likely to serve him
Hudson Fysh and Fergus McMaster
with their aircraft, George Towns, Harry
Hawker’s old assistant with his novel
ideas about portable radio, Alf Traeger
with his genius, Dr George Simpson—
all found him sitting on their doorsteps
very early in history intent on turning
their resources to the service of the
Inland.
He was a master publicity man who
hated personal publicity. The only time
I ever saw him really perturbed about
anything personal was when his startled
gaze had just fallen on lon Idriess’s
book “Flynn of the Inland”. He came
in with angry tears in his eyes to ask:
“Do people really think I am like that?”
Yet Idriess made him known to most
Australians and thus indirectly did a
great service to his work.
The Flynn legend is one of the Aus-
tralian legends—perhaps the only one —■
which is still read in terms of under-
statement. But his stature grows. Time
will place him near the head of the roll
of those Australians esteemed justly and
permanently great.

STOTT'S COLLEGES undertake that no rep-
resentative will call following your inquiry.
he was advised by “a panel of three men
of artistic standing”, one representing the
artistic Left, one the artistic Centre, and
one the artistic Right. None of the
three is named, which they should be
because they have made important
judgments; and they have not made a
very good job of selection either, even
within their planned limits.
This is the only way in which artistic
judgments affect “Australian Painters”.
The profiles themselves are all a mixture
of biography and personal statement
which Mr Hetherington treats generously
and neutrally. Although he can give a
quite clear description of a painter’s
style, he deliberately avoids any com-
ment on its merits. Certainly it is argu-
able whether this is too severe a restric-
tion, especially when the subject has been
chosen because he is a painter, and one
hopes also an artist. You get the feel-
ing rather too often that the most inter-
esting part has been left out in favor of
amiable tales and unusually detailed
records of war service. Nonetheless a
lot of the biographical information is new
and illuminating, and Mr Hetherington
has, thank God, made the painters’ per-
sonal statements of belief quite lucid.
Anyone who writes about Albert
Namatjira must inevitably become en-
tangled with two separate issues: his
claim to consideration as a painter and
his tragic struggle to make his way in a
society which never quite made up its
mind what he was. Joyce Batty wisely
and justly concentrates on the second
issue, and presents a simple chronolo-
gical account of Namatjira’s (and our)
ill-starred attempt to make the best of
two worlds.
Although Mrs Batty avoids arguing for
herself, she makes it clear that her sym-
pathies are with those who blame Namat-
jira’s ultimate decline on white society,
particularly on administrators and sharp
dealers. The basic point, of the incom-
patibility of aboriginal and white social
obligations, she makes very convincingly.
No one who reads this will doubt that
Namatjira suffered grave injustice, and
they will have, moreover, a sinking feel-
ing that another aborigine in a similar
situation could still suffer in the same
way. So long as the Gods live on (and
who will say they should be destroyed?)
the story must move w'ith the relentless-
ness of a Greek tragedy.
On the question of Namatjira’s merits
as an artist, Mrs Batty flounders. She
simply appeals to an ever-diminishing
number of authorities, whose sensitivity
she gauges according to their enthusiasm
for Albert’s work. The most balanced
judgment she quotes is that his work has
some historical importance.
No one doubts Namatjira’s sincerity
or dignity both as a man and an artist,
but it is pointless solemnly to tut-tut at
gallery directors and critics because
they did not join in the bun-rush. I
suspect in fact that Mrs Batty often
lets her sentiments gallop away with
her insight. Granted that she and many
others may have been thrilled to bits
by Royalty’s patronage of Albert, if not
always by the acclaim of lesser digni-
taries, it is still alarmingly naive of a
biographer to conclude that Albert w'as
inscrutably dignified and profoundly
modest because he was not equally ex-
cited by the gracious presence.
The man’s real character is obscured
by so much concentration on the quaint-
ness of his response to unfamiliar and
unimportant values. Similarly if Namat-
jira’s dilemma is to be presented even
partially as an artistic one, his biographer
needs to be more capable in her
judgments. Too often the narrative bogs
down in solemn fatuities.
Publication on local sculpture is so
rare that even a sixteen-page booklet
is most welcome. The Gallery A-Gray-
flower work illustrates twelve of Norma
Redpath’s recent bronzetti. It is first-
rate sculpture, probably, along with
Robert Klippel’s, the best that has been
done here, and being on a very small
scale, its quality comes out fairly well in
photographs. Gordon Thompson’s 700-
word text (which is an abominable piece
of typography) gives an enthusiastic but
sound impression of her aims and
achievements. Unfortunately galleries
here can rarely afford to produce large,
illustrated catalogues like their overseas
counterparts, but it would be agreeable

The Pill
The Time Has Come. John Rock.
Longmans. 225. 6d.
Tt seems that we are moving rapidly
into a stage when the solution of
many great social issues will require
general biological as well as political
knowledge. This book is a sober contri-
bution by a Roman Catholic to the cur-
rent discussions on contraception.
Dr Rock is a leading Harvard gynae-
cologist, now in his seventies, and one of
the pioneer workers on the contracep-
tive pill. He lucidly examines the atti-
tude of his Church to birth control in
the past century. He draws the familiar
humanist conclusions about the relation-
ship between excessive fertility and ruin-
ous poverty. Like most of us, he would
prefer that human beings should grow
on a qualitative rather than on a quanti-
tative basis. Dr Rock well knows that his
Church now stands alone as a major
social force with an official negative
attitude to birth control, but he can ace
signs of a more moderate and realistic
doctrine of responsible parenthood emer-
ging. He shows that in some instance*
the official teaching at the top is less
restrictive than its application below.
The religious argument, of course, is
about methods. The Safe Period is
“natural” and acceptable. Dr Rock would
have it that The Pill, being (almost) a
natural hormone, is (almost) in the same
category. It does not take much pro-
bing to find that few sciences are exact
all the way, least of all human physiology,
and when theologians and word-splitting
apologists enter the arena the ground
becomes littered with exasperating iro-
nies as another inconclusive verbal battle
is fought between two cultures. The doc-
tor’s best and most relevant points do not
directly concern The Pill at all, but are
about the way in which the Safe Period
could be made safe. If there were
a simple chemical test of urine which
would predict to a woman the exact days
of her ovulation, then the Safe Period
could become as reliable as The Pill, and
being already acceptable there could be
no more controversy. If, further, there
were a cheap and reliable method of in-
ducing ovulation at a predictable time
in those in whom it was otherwise occur-
ring irregularly, then these too could
know clearly their fertile days. In Dr
Rock’s opinion a research programme
could achieve both these objects.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Specks on the Farming Horizon
After a heart-warming account of rural prospects for
1963-64, the National Bank of Australasia’s latest
monthly summary sees fit to end on a tone of ineffable
platitude “There is in Australia ample scope for increasing
the volume of rural output in the long term, and the basic
problem is by no means always the level of production but
disposal of the product at a worthwhile price.”
Those last few words of vague and distantly pitched warning
may not succeed in piercing very far into what must be many
farmers’ present mood of exceedingly soothing euphoria.
Rural industry now begins to envisage a gross production
valued at about £1620 million for 1963-64, roughly 10 p.c.
more than the previous year’s record. Better still, high prices
seem to guarantee an export income approaching £lOl5
million, or £2OO million above both 1962-
63 and 1961-62. Wool, wheat, meat and
sugar are each on the rise.
One or two cautious souls could be
wondering if the Arbitration Commis-
sion is going to give a push to costs which
would ultimately spread from the manu-
facturing to the rural sector. Some might
even wonder at the general situation of
world overproduction and a growing
rash of protectionist policies.
These chastening views are probably
not going very deep, however. And
without yet knowing any exact details,
there may also be a tendency for farmers
to view with relief the apparently favor-
able resolution of the problems of wheat
and meat in Britain and America.
Despite strenuous lobbying by the
Texas ranchers ( and a forthcoming tariff
inquiry on beef imports starting on April
28), the US and Australian Governments
have seemingly managed to strike a “satisfactory” agreement
covering beef and veal.
Despite the still-existent British resolve to rationalise its
own home production and foodstuff imports, the breakdown
of talks means a temporary continuance of the Australia-UK
meat agreement giving free, non-quota entry. Acceptance of
minimum wheat prices is also seen as to Australia’s advantage.
To gild the atmosphere of respite, the Kennedy Round,
throwing agricultural as well as manufacturing bargaining
into the international ring, does not give evidence of reaching
serious negotiation this year.
None of these delays, let alone the present buoyant
commodity prices, should induce the smallest measure of
complacency. All farm products can take a cue from Mr
J. L. Shute, the chairman of the Australian Meat Board.
On his return from overseas, Mr Shute emphasised that
meat must not rely on a limited number of markets to absorb
the export surplus. The Australian meat industry “is in a
very vulnerable position, with most of its exports going to
the United States and the United Kingdom,” he stressed.
The tale of what should become of immediate concern has
not finished, though. In that slightly marred, long-term future
examined by the National Bank, not only trading volumes
and costs are at issue. The standards of some Australian
rural output are also under severe and damaging criticism.
Perhaps the persistent demand from America for hygienic-
ally adequate meat does not sound particularly damaging at
the moment. But the considered and detailed statement from
the Japanese wool trade on the decline of Australian merino
wool preparation calls for quick corrective action. The specks
on the horizon are getting too close.
Business Enticements
in the Caribbean
T>ecently returned from a study tour
of the West Indies, Mr Bernard
Cross, a Melbourne business consultant,
underlines the case for increasing Aus-
tralian investment overseas as expound-
ed in the Commonwealth Banking Cor-
poration's booklet, “Australia and World
Trade” referred to in The Bulletin,
February 8.
Mr Cross thinks there is a great op-
portunity for Australian companies in
the West Indies. “There”, he told The
Bulletin, “swaying palms, golden sands
and lithe limbo dancers are a great lure
for the tired businessman, but the real
enticements are those to foreign investors
by the governments of the three island
countries, until recently members of the Federation, now
independent.”
To reduce their chronically high unemployment rates the
governments are going all out to encourage secondary industry
with such incentives as tax-free periods, duty-free imports
of plant and certain materials, full repatriation of profit and
capital, accelerated depreciation allowances.
Mr Cross cited several other reasons why Australian
companies should consider setting up plants in the Caribbean.
He said that the income per head of the 4+ million population
of the three islands was increasing, making it a good market
itself. This could act as a buffer for marketing ‘safaris’ into
South America for which it could be a good springboard.
Further, land was cheap, transport (rail and road transport)
good and handy to ports which were also quite efficient. It
was important, too, that English was spoken.
At present there is no local heavy industry in these countries.
There is a local market for semi-luxury goods, appliances,
air-conditioning units (all appliances are imported), building
materials and accessories, hardware and sanitary equipment.
In Mr Cross’s view “they could really use a steel industry”.


Home Truths for Textiles
in Tariff Inquiry
fire-and-brimstone retaliatory threats against wool made
by Japanese cotton textile interests pressing their case
before the Tariff Board scarcely deserve serious attention if
both Australia and Japan continue to conduct themselves in
the tenor of the mutual trade agreement.
Far otherwise is the importance to be attached to Japan’s
citing of the extremely variable efficiencies ruling throughout
Australia’s textile industry. Many critics have remarked on
these discrepancies before, adding a natural rider that whole-
sale protection does not appear to be the answer.
The absolutely basic social significance of the tariff hearings
(and of the Arbitration Commission’s wages case) is urged in
“Economics Anonymous” on page 46.
Japanese arguments cannot simply be shrugged off, even
though they are expressed by a far from detached party. The
lesson is read plainly: “In the cases where the costs in the
Australian cotton fabric industry remain higher than the
price for imported goods, after making some allowance for
the handicaps . . ., the difference in price should be resolved
at the responsibility of the enterprises concerned. That is a
matter for their efforts and not for protection by the Govern-
ment.”
All too easily the Japanese can refer to indulgence in “hot
house” conditions behind a protective tariff and also preach
the doctrine of rationalisation, “disposing of idle equipment
deliberately and systematically, instead of attempting to utilise
it by protective measures”.
Decisions are complex and invidious in such a labor-
intensive industry. But the nettle of economy and efficiency
must ultimately be grasped.
Melb. Stock Exchange
Index Modernised
Stock Exchange of Melbourne, in at last revising the
component stocks of its 50 leaders share index, has
replaced eight shares it now considers less representative of
“leader” status than when the original 50 were chosen. The
new introductions certainly make the index more suitable for
its purpose.
Last July when the new index was introduced The Bulletin
pointed out the need for changes if it was accurately to reflect
the general movement of market leaders.
The replaced stocks are Australian United Corporation,
Carrier Air, Clyde Industries, Cyclone, Davies Coop, Howard
Smith, Mayne Nickless and Moulded Products. In their place
are substituted Australian Guarantee, Bank of NSW, Boral,
Commercial Union, CRA, Custom Credit, TV Corporation and
Woolworths.
In addition to revising the leaders index, 41 new stocks
have been included in the specialist indices which now cover
326 companies, still in 15 separate industrial groups. The
aggregate market value of this expanded sample comprises
91 p.c. of all ordinary listed capital compared with 88 p.c.
before.
The 41 additions comprise mainly those stocks which
recently exceeded £1 million in market value. On the other
hand, those in the original index whose market value has
fallen below £1 million have not been deleted. This seems to
be a rather unbalanced approach to take. The Stock Exchange
pointed out that stocks would be reviewed the next time a
revision was made, presumably on the view they may regain
the million mark in the meantime.
There’s Something Like
Leather for Shoes
merchants and the footwear industry may have to
meet drastic competition from the all - synthetic shoe
rather sooner than expected. The threat received nodding
recognition in Wm Haughton and Company’s last annual
report. Australian interests must realise that complacency in
the synthetics versus natural materials battle has never been
justified by consumer trends.
The issue is now vigorously joined in There the
giant Du Pont combine has capped 13 years of research with
pilot production of synthetic leather and plans to be in full-
scale manufacture shortly.
An actual shoe maker, Arnav Industries Inc. of New Jersey,
finds itself further along the line. It is selling a lOOp.c. plastic
shoe, upper and sole and heel unit guaranteed chemically and
permanently bonded.
Agencies are already being sought by Arnav in Australia.
The new plastic materials “breathe” like leather and appear
very much cost-competitive. “This may well be the nylon of
the leather industry,” another US shoe expert has remarked.
Previous plastic leather substitutes had been suitable only
for cheap shoes, but Arnav and Du Pont compositions appeal
all along the price range. Customer resistance appears easy
to overcome, so it need not be long before Australian foot-
wear companies will be forced to join in the swim. .
Japan’s Key Influence
On Exports
Having digested last year’s windfall sales of wheat, flour,
sugar, plus the happy extension of meat sales to Japan
and drought-affected America, Australia must think of future
commodity sales in terms of permanent markets.
It is of immediate concern, therefore, to follow the trend
of economic events in Japan, which has crept into top place
as Australia’s export market.
Japan has indicated there are plenty of obstacles in the
way of setting up a regional community like EEC in the
Asian-Pacific area, because it must involve consideration of
the complex interests of nations like Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines and other small Asian countries as well as Aus-
tralia, New Zealand and Japan.
And Japan must buy wherever she can gain the best advan-
tage. That is why careful consideration should be given to
recent suggestions in Japan for economic restraints. Any
downturn in Japanese buying capacity must have an influence
on Australian export prospects, not the least of which is
the price of wool. Australia’s reserves look good at the
moment because of remarkable export sales, some of which
will be non-recurring, particularly after 1964.
Meanwhile, the pressure is on to buy more from other coun-
tries and the (so far) slow recovery in imports could be given
a sharp nudge in 1964. The five months’ export figures to
November showed that Japan took £101.6m. from Australia
compared with £68.9m. in the corresponding five months of
1962. So any downtrend in this market, combined with an
increased flow of imports, would reduce sharply the current
buoyant trend.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Two Key Economic Issues
Japan s textile demands and the Basic Wage case
A ustralian economic policy-making
processes are being put to a hard
test this month as two key issues come
up for decision in the Tariff Board and
the Arbitration Commission, the two
statutory bodies which function in
parallel to the main central economic
policy-making process and not as integral
parts of it.
The issues are crystal clear, and if
the decisions reached cannot have much
immediate effect on the prosperity of the
economy, they could have a strong
bearing on the future of overseas trade
on the one hand and the stable balance
of the economy on the other.
The issue before the Tariff Board is
simply that before the current hearing
of the cotton textile industry’s applica-
tion for higher protection, a delegation
from Japan intimated that the granting
of higher tariffs to the industry could
bring reprisals from Japan which would
threaten the maintenance and expansion
of our exports to that country.
The one before the Arbitration Com-
mission is that a substantial increase in
the basic wage at this time when there
is a serious shortage of skilled labor
in industry could upset price stability.
Neither the Tariff Board nor the
Arbitration Commission is likely to take
anything but a highly responsible and
national view on these issues, but it is
somewhat frustrating to the Federal
Government that it has to take the risk
of the findings being out of line with its
own general pattern of economic policy,
and to have to rely on the objective
and independent judgments of the two
bodies seeing things its way.
"Perhaps the appointment of a senior
A Department of Trade official as
chairman of the Tariff Board after Sir
Leslie Melville’s departure last year makes
the risk far less in the case of the Tariff
Board than with the Arbitration Com-
mission.
While it is probably not true to say
that the Tariff Board has become a
thoroughly bound captive of the Depart-
ment of Trade (Mr R. J. Murray’s
remark last week that the “Tariff Board
doesn’t scare very easily” confirms that)
it is hard to see it making decisions
running counter to the defined lines of
the department’s trade policies including
its designs on Japanese markets.
On the other hand, without a brief
from the Government the Tariff Board
could find itself in some difficulty re-
solving the dilemma forced on it by Mr
Echigo in deciding the future level of
protection for cotton textiles, because
it becomes more and more clear that
the economic case for higher protection
may have to be heavily discounted for
the wider overseas trade considerations.
That is to say, in order to ensure
the expansion of exports to Japan, or
even to hold them at present levels,
the price could be a reduction in the
activity of the cotton textiles industry
in this country, however unpalatable that
may be for the interests concerned.
It is quite a different matter with
the Arbitration Commission which,
following a decision by Sir Richard
Kirby last week, is going to adjudge
the metal trades employers’ proposals
to change the system of wage fixing
at the same time as it considers the
employees’ application for an increase
of £2 12s. a week in the basic wage.
HThe best the Government can do to
influence the Arbitration Commis-
sion is to put up a case on the floor of
the Commission, but so far it has given
no indication of such an intention and,
at least on the straight-out issue of the
basic wage application, it may not be
very keen to appear this time.
For one thing it could hardly argue
that some increase was unjustified in
view of the current state of economic
prosperity. Its general theme these last
few months (including the election
period) has been its magnificent econo-
mic achievements, including a rise of
7.8 p.c. in GNP at market prices in
1962-63, an increase which has had to
be scaled down somewhat after statistical
treatment to become merely 5.1 p.c. at
constant prices.
Even allowing for the 10 p.c. in-
crease in margins last year, there would
still seem to be something left of the
productivity increase since 1960, to be
taken up in an increase in the basic
wage, if, in fact, that is the way the
Commission should look at the matter.
The employers have reckoned that this
margin would amount to, at the most,
an Bs. a week addition to the total wage
bill.
One would have thought that the
Government’s economists could go along
with an increase of that amount and
probably as much as 10s. a week as
an increase in the basic wage in the
old manner of reckoning. But it would
seem that the Government should also
come to the Commission this time and
put its views, not only on this aspect
and on the vitally important submissions
of the employers to have a new system
of wage fixing, but also on the
importance of not siphoning away the
bountiful harvest of export income this
year into higher wage rates in secondary
industry.
Af all the cards used by the trade
unions in their arguments before
the Commission, it is a safe bet that Mr
Hawke will keep on pulling out this
one, that the increase in export income
this year represents a substantial in-
crease in the country’s capacity to pay
the higher basic wage being sought by
the unions.
In the past the Commission appears
to have been impressed by this sort of
argument (as in 1950, for instance, when
in similar circumstances of rapidly in-
creasing export income the Commission
lifted the basic wage by 20s. a week
and sparked off the disastrous in-
flationary spiral of the following year).
So it is to be hoped that an economist
of repute is put up, either by the
Government or the employers, to refute
it before the Commission, perhaps
quoting the 1950-51 experience as an
example.
More Moves to Meat
IVl’onbulk Preserves’ recent acquisi-
tion of two private companies—a
Continental smallgoods manufacturer and
a fresh meat retailer—should lift the
profitability of the group’s meat opera-
tions when integrated with the present
works at Doveton and Dandenong (Vic.).
These moves into the meat market
are being made to counter difficulties
experienced in this Victorian company’s
original business—fruit and jam canning.
One acquisition, Budapest Copenhagen
Continental Smallgoods, should open up
new outlets for a variety of products
while B.C. Meats (St Kilda) will add
another retail outlet to those already
operated in Melbourne suburbia.
From the Dandenong abattoirs, Mon-
bulk sells to USA, Canada, Britain and
Japan.

Wages Are Two Parts Greater
Than the Whole?
The first of two articles on the Basic Wage Case before the
Arbitration Commission
By C. P. MILLS, LL.B., B.Ec.,
Senior Lecturer in Commercial
and Industrial Law, University
of Sydney
recent challenge to the
time-honored Australian method of
wage-fixation has been taken by the
unions as an attack on wage standards
but, w'hether this be a true assessment
or not, if the central core of. these pro-
posals is accepted it need not operate
in this way.
If we omit, for the time being, the
actual money amounts of the increases
in the claims and counter-claims, we
can examine, as a matter of principle,
the main question of whether it is just
and reasonable to abandon the concept
of the basic wage in the wage structure.
The validity of the division of the
wage into two parts depends in the
long run on the function of each
separate part but, whatever may have
been the original position, it is virtually
impossible today to assign any precise
and logical definition to either part.
For at least 30 years the basic wage
has not been specifically related to the
minimum needs of the family bread-
winner. The 10 p.c. reduction in 1931
was based solely on prevailing economic
conditions. The “fresh start”, as the
Arbitration Court characterised its 1934
determination, was simply the fixation
of an “economically sound” level, thus
affording to the recipient the highest
standard of living that the Australian
economy could provide, and all the
basic wage cases since then have been
determined on much the same principle.
Ihe state of the economy has deter-
mined the amount of the basic wage
and, in turn, the wage-earner’s standard
of living. Indeed, there are grounds for
suggesting that the very first fixation
of the amount of the basic wage was
made along these lines, and that the
process by which Mr lustice Higgins
arrived at, in his now famous Harvester
Award of 1907, was more by using
the amounts being paid by reputable
employers as a guide to the amount of
the wage (and the standard of living)
that was within the capacity of the
industry, than by reliance on the very
meagre data which he had before him
as to family budgets.
■ The Arbitration Act describes the
basic wage as a “just and reasonable”
wage for an adult, to be determined
without regard to the work of the
.
employee or to the industry in which
he is engaged, but in fact we find that
the basic wage varies in amount from
industry to industry and, especially in
the case of women, according to the
work they do.
The subjective nature of the words
“just and reasonable” leaves the deter-
minants of the wage virtually at the
discretion of the Arbitration Com-
mission, and liable to alteration from
time to time.
The circumstances of the employee’s
work—the skill, effort and unpleasant-
ness involved —and of the industry in
which he is employed can receive recog-

nition only by way of the margin, the
amount which is added to the base
figure determined according to the above
“principles”. But there are plenty of
statements by the arbitration tribunals
that the proper way of fixing a rate for
a job is to look at the total amount
that is to be awarded, and certainly
this is the vital thing for the employer
and the employee, as well as for the
economic welfare of Australia.
All budgets, whether they be national,
business or domestic, recognise only
money terms and draw no distinction
between the different parts of the wage.
Furthermore, there are few, if any,
basic wage earners left in Australia;
almost every award contains a “margin”
for the “all others” or “n.e.i.” classifi-
cation.
It is true that this “margin” may be
only 10s. or 155., and the unskilled
worker may complain that it is so small
as to be almost negligible. But the point
is that these margins arise in many
cases from the recognition that the basic
wage represents a truly frugal way of
life and they are simply basic wage
increases in disguise.
These arguments suggest strongly that,
as a matter of logic, there is no reason
for retaining the division of the wage
into two parts. The unions, however,
appear to be basing their opposition on
two arguments that the process of
reviewing the parts of the wage in one
hearing will freeze established differen-
tials between wage rates, and will erode
the real position of the lowest wage
earners.
That present differentials should
become virtually unalterable need not,
and certainly should not, occur. In fact,
the more likely result will be a more
constant and careful effort than has been
customary in the past to protect these
differentials against loss of their real
value as the result of inflation.
The practice, of periodic inquiries into
margins was instituted just for this
purpose. General inquiries into the basic
wage had become part of the established
techniques of industrial arbitration well
before the Second World War, but it
was only the post-war inflation that
caused the unions to adapt the same
process to the margins.
The loss in the purchasing power of
money, coupled with substantial in-
creases in the basic wage resulting partly
from inflation and partly from deliberate
additions awarded by the Court, reduced
the value of margins generally, both in
terms of purchasing power and in
relation to the basic wage.
As a result of this, the unions initiated
the first general margins inquiry of 1954.
In fact, unions have long sought, with-
out success, acceptance by the arbitra-
tion tribunals of the principle that the
fixation of a marginal rate should imply
a fixed relation to the basic wage and
that, in the absence of changes in the
nature of- the work or the conditions
under which it is done, or, perhaps the
economic conditions of the particular
industry concerned, that relationship
should be maintained unchanged.
The present proposal by the employers
will achieve this, but there has not been
any suggestion (and even if it were made
the Arbitration Commission would be
almost certain to reject it out of hand)
that review of wage rates in the light
of nation-wide conditions should pre-
clude a separate review of the rates for
a single industry or occupation in the
light of its own special factors.


“CROESUS”
PR Image of HP
But why can’t the charges come down?
VTo group of Australian companies in
a single industry has succeeded so
well in improving its public image in the
last few years as the select band of hire-
purchase companies comprising the Hire
Purchase Conference, w'hose chairman
for 1963-64 (Mr J. H. Partridge) con-
tinued to blow the sw'eet PR trumpet at
the recent annual meeting at Canberra.
What a change, say, from 1960, when
HP companies were considered the devils
of the economic piece and the Govern-
ment, determined to teach them a lesson
in good economic behavior, introduced
the infamous tax-on-interest.
However, not even the services of the
country’s leading PR people can alto-
gether erase the impression that while
borrowing rates have been coming down
for a long time now, the charges of the
companies to the public for HP services
remain inflexible and haven’t come down
at all.
The Conference's chairman, Mr J. H.
Partridge, attempted to justify this in-
flexibility by saying it wasn’t feasible to
expect any great alteration in the rates
charged on hire-purchase agreements or
other forms of financing, because the
fall in borrowing rates has only applied
to a small portion of the total funds
borrowed from the public over a long
period, w'hile salary and other costs of
operation are rising.
This is very hard to believe. One
would have thought by this time borrow'-
ing rates had averaged down consider-
ably on total funds employed by the
companies over the last three years, and
that in any case current loan rates on
new HP contracts should be related to
current borrowing rates for new money,
not on historical or averaged-down rates.
Instead, as Mr Partridge stated, “com-
petition has kept hiring charges at a fair
and reasonable level”. It could be that
one of the main successes of the Hire
Purchase Conference has been to keep
rates high “by agreement”.
How innocent Mr Partridge makes the
group’s main business activity seem
under this expensive cloak!
“The so-called ‘hire purchase debt’,”
he says, “should more aptly be described
as an indication of the extent goods and
services are made available to the com-
munity which people might not other-
wise have. It is, therefore, in the nature
of an index of the standard of living.
Regular instalment payments are an
‘enforced saving’ and contribute to the
accumulation of durable consumer goods
or ‘consumer investment’.”
Really!
If the services of the HP companies
are as valuable to the economy and the
people as Mr Partridge suggests they
are, even that is no reason why their cost
cannot be brought down. Indeed, it is
a good reason for bringing them down
so that more people can avail themselves
of the services.
It is not going too far to say that the
malaise which has swept the durable
consumer goods field in the last two or
three years is due in no small part to
the exorbitant charges of the HP com-
panies in the boom. No wonder Mr Part-
ridge can say that most of the HP
business in durable consumer goods has
passed to the stores themselves, who
have been forced to reduce their charges
(in any case watered down by huge
trade-ins, discounts, etc.) to make sales,
while the HP companies have proceeded
to go after more profitable lending
business in other fields.
(Mr Partridge said that member com-
panies of the Hire Purchase Conference
have only 58 p.c. of their £550 million
of outstandings in the form of retail
instalment credit, which presumably
includes motor vehicles. The rest covers
leasing, factoring, development finance,
equity financing, commercial loans, first
and second mortgage finance, “bridging”
finance and personal loans.)
Naturally companies in the Confer-
ence are concerned to divert the Govern-
ment’s attention from direct controls
likely to limit their operation, and though
the companies keep their own charges
inflexible, Mr Partridge said “it has been
well shown by economists that dis-
criminatory measures directed at par-
ticular finance organisations outside the
banking system are inefficient and it
may well be that the introduction of
varying interest rates would be of great
assistance to the Federal Government
and would be preferable to most of the
measures of control previously suggested
or used, especially those involving fiscal
policy” (a reference to the tax on
interest, no doubt).
This may seem a very strange thought
coming from a quarter which has re-
fused to lower its charges in a period
when interest rates have been falling
over the whole economy under the lead
of official policy.
More to the point are the remarks
made last week by the Deputy Manager
of the Bank of NSW, Mr R. W. Norman,
to the Junior Chamber of Commerce in
Sydney, when he pointed the bone
straight at the “second banking system”
whose hard core is, in fact, the com-
panies of the Hire Purchase Conference.
“The Government remained oblivious
of the growth of a dearer, newer
financial system which had the effect of
raising both the velocity of circulation
and the cost of money,” Mr Norman
said.
Referring to banking controls, Mr
Norman said that Australian experience
had not shown that either total lending
or inflation was reduced simply because
the authorities applied controls dis-
crim inatorily or exclusively over the
banks. What had happened W'as that
other relatively uncontrolled financiers
had arisen and, by and large, would-be
borrowers had been accommodated by
them, but at a cost far higher than would
have been the case had banks been free
to lend.
LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Sir,
While appreciating your writer’s right
to comment on price movements on the
Stock Exchange (Bulletin 8/2/64), it
seems unfair to criticise Mr Korman for
doing what he can to protect current
investors in his stock. Naturally it is up
to the individual investor to decide when
to sell, but at least if the chairman of his
company sets out the facts plainly, then
the shareholder or note or debenture
holder cannot complain later if the prices
rise.
The investing public has a long
memory, and I suggest only time and a
steady record of recovery will restore
complete faith in Factors. But such things
are possible, and I would feel that
present shareholders in Factors should
be able to look to a parallel story of
recovery with reasonable confidence. The
association of CAGA with Factors board
in the next few critical months must add
a further measure of stability.

INVESTMENT SECTION
ICIANZ Joins the Protectionist Swim
Report echoes findings of “The Bulletin’s” chemical survey
Bulletin’s survey of the Aus-
tralian chemical industry (February
15) was provided with a very effective
postscript by the appearance of
ICIANZ’s full annual report last week.
In reviewing the giant’s 1962-63 year
the managing director, Mr J. R. A.
Glenn, gave an epitome of the situation
facing lesser companies as well.
One outstanding difference pushes
itself obviously forward, apart from
mere size. Mr Glenn’s whole account
breathes tribute to a remarkable
efficiency and confidence now emanating
from ICIANZ.
Investors have already noticed the
import of being able to lift group profits
20 p.c. on an adjusted sales advance of
4 p.c. They had, of course, hardly for-
gotten the wise decision to proceed on
a huge expansion programme even at
the height of the credit squeeze.
So the 20s. shares are moving around
565. 6d. just equalling their 1963 best
and well ahead of 1962’s top 48s. 9d.,
to produce dividend yield of 2.5 p.c.
The current earnings yield—a modest
3.8 p.c.—perhaps continues to provoke
some misgivings in shareholders. Yet
both recent assets accessions and the
immediate capital projects suggest that
directors are contemplating another size-
able increase in profits for 1963-64.
It needs to be remembered precisely
how they dealt with the past year: “In
the marketing field, competition was
vigorous and spread over a wide range
of products. As far as possible it has
been countered by a determined and
active pricing and sales policy.”
Nevertheless, after all the success, it
sounds particularly interesting to hear
ICIANZ echoing the general burden of
The Bulletin survey.
Almost thankfully Mr Glenn looks
forward to the forthcoming Tariff Board
investigation of the industrial chemicals’
and synthetic resins’ side of Australian
manufacture. “It is hoped that the
Board’s findings will result in effective
consideration being given to the dis-
abilities peculiar to the industry,” he
observes.
There are no bones about the tariff
being needed “Although the erection
of larger plants in Australia could
materially assist local producers in meet-
ing overseas competition, protection
would still be required. Investments
like these need a large share of the
domestic market for efficient operation.”
In its 1962-63 report ICIANZ had
asserted that “the most attractive levels
of profitability in the chemical industry
will, in future, be mainly centred upon
the discovery of new products and
radically new processes”.
This chase after newness does not
merely stop short at a massive research
expenditure. The world over, chemical
industries are then forced to build
bigger plants than sensible expansion
demands in order to contain costs against
hectic competition and reduced prices.
There’s little necessity to add that capital-
intensive plants also must be run close
to full capacity.
ICIANZ therefore makes a point of
its “study of volume of sales in relation
to price, research into the use of raw
materials common to a number of
products and exploring the possibilities
of new export markets”.
A dividing line between overcapacity
and an economic reserve capacity seems
somewhat hard to draw. ICIANZ’s latest
results speak for considerable skill at the
guessing game, so investors may feel
duly comforted.
Jinxes at Jervoia
T'he wealth of “expert” opinions and
estimates in the long overdue circular
to shareholders from Jervois Sulphates
still fails to reveal a probable starting
date for production.
When the company was listed last
June it expected the mine to be in full
production by the end of the year. But
a trial run of the copper sulphate plant
at the mine, which is in the Northern
Territory, 230 miles north-east of Alice
Springs, was made last November and
“excessive” teething troubles were re-
vealed.
To help solve these problems, the
board invited Mr A. Bellingham, a
mining equipment expert, to report on
the plant and its prospects. His com-
ments formed the basis of the circular
to shareholders.
He said the project was “feasible”
and that, subject to plant modifications
and expert management, the original
profit estimate (an earning rate of more
than 30 p.c. on £125,000 of paid-up
capital) could be reached. He also
recommended the appointment of a firm
of mining consultants to assist during the
final construction and initial production
of the plant.
If the consultants’ report is favorable,
additional funds will be required to finish
the project. Where these will come from
is anybody’s guess, but it is certain
shareholders will not take kindly to
putting up more money especially if no
production date is indicated.
The situation has not been helped by
the long time it took directors to advise
the shareholders of the company’s prob-
lems. Their faith will also be weakened
by Mr Bellingham’s stipulation that
expert management is necessary for
success the board has proved to be
rather inexpert so far, despite the fact
that its chairman is the well-known
economist, Sir Douglas Copland.
Cheapa Chirpier
VTot without its troubles a couple of
years ago, Cheapa Glass Co. Ltd
is now acting chirpier with a takeover
bid for Sydney Glass Co. Pty Ltd.
The offer, in shares, notes and cash,
is worth about £lOO,OOO while Cheapa’s
20s. shares sell at around 30s.
The company plans to make a private
issue of ordinary shares at a premium
to provide the cash portion of the con-
sideration.
Last earning rate was 11.2 p.c. leaving
a fine margin for the 10 p.c. dividend.
The earnings trend for the first half of
the 1963-64 year will naturally have to
be better to justify the present expansion.
The company, of course, should have
benefited from the improvement in
building.
Independence Before Cash
TAirectors of Tomlinson Steel Ltd may
rue the day they put independence
before good, hard cash.
Shareholders missed out on dividends
in five of the last eight years, and
although 6 p.c. and 7 p.c. were paid in
the last two years, a loss of £20,000
in the latest December six months
minimises the possibility of a dividend
for 1963-64.
Tomlinson directors have spurned an
offer of 10s. cash from Clyde Industries
Ltd, which apparently is anxious to
acquire in a hurry facilities to assemble
locomotives for the standard-gauge rail
project.
Clyde has threatened to establish a
competing business if Tomlinson share-

CapePs Capital Climb
A lthough the dividend of Capel Court
Investment has not been higher
than 8 p.c. in recent years, shareholders
have been receiving steady benefits from
a number of par issues which have lifted
paid capital from £400,000 in 1960 to
£640,000 at 1963 balance date.
The company, a member of the group
of investment and underwriting com-
panies affiliated with the Melbourne
broking house of J. B. Were and Son,
has just announced another issue, its
fourth since 1960. It accompanied a
report of a record profit in the 1963 year
of £62,472, equalling 10.3 p.c. on
capital, and will lift paid capital by a
further £128,000.
The big advantage of these issues to
shareholders is the tax-free capital benefit
income they receive. Preceding the
latest one-for-five issue was a one-for-
seven, a one-for-six and another one-
for-five.
Agues’ Jubilation
npHE recovery in the quarrying industry
will certainly produce some vastly
improved results from the affiliated com-
panies this year. Consolidated Quarries
has already announced a 48 p.c. pre-tax
profit increase. But there will be few
results as startling as the interim report
recently released by Jaques Bros, Mel-
bourne-based manufacturer of stone-
crushing equipment and excavating
machinery.
Profit in the half-year was at a
“higher and satisfactory level” so the
company is returning to the dividend
list with a 4 p.c. payout. In the full
1962-63 year dividend was omitted
following a loss of some £114,000
mainly due to the heavy writing down
of stocks to the tune of £127,239 a
small profit of more than £12,000
resulted from trading operations.
The recovery was not entirely un-
expected as the directors said in the
1962-63 annual report that “satisfactory
profits” were expected for the current
year. The degree of satisfaction must be
reasonably high to warrant the payment
of an interim dividend. On the other
hand, it would be wise not to attach too
much importance to the payout because
in 1961-62 a 74 p.c. distribution was
made although earnings equalled only
6.3 p.c. on capital.
Nevertheless, the effects of a buoyant
quarrying industry and the lower pro-
duction costs brought about by re-
organisation within the group should
produce a respectable earning rate this
year. If this be the case, shareholders
may see a return of the 10 p.c. dividend
which was paid consistently from 1954-
55 to 1960-61.
Speedo Speeds Up
T>ebates on export promotion ex-
penditure allow Speedo Holdings
Ltd, clothing maker, to provide steady
tax for a larger profit in the first half
of the current year to June. Net result
"Eek! Not in there; they'll suck the blood out of us."
was a lift in profit from £55,781 to
£59,120. Export sales rose from £16,602
to £60,343.
Accounts were easier to collect in the
improved economic conditions, so that
debtors’ balances fell from £346,899 to
£337,434 despite higher sales.
Stocks have been considerably reduced
after the build-up to June 30, 1963, and
at December 30 were well down on the
figures for the same date the year before.
The 124 p.c. dividend of two years
ago is being restored by an interim
payment of 64 p.c. The shares are now
around 10s. 3d. to yield 6.1 p.c.
Substantially higher winter orders for
Speedo knitwear should produce an
encouraging improvement in earnings
over last year’s 12.3 p.c. on capital.
Silence on Court Settlement
Shareholders are none the wiser, since
Kosciusko Chalet Ltd’s extraordinary
meeting, as to the terms of the out-of-
court settlement with Transfield Pty
Ltd concerning the chairlift.
The preference share issue, which was
to finance the settlement and complete
the chairlift, was approved by share-
holders at the meeting, but directors
declined to give details of the settlement.
Installation of the chairlift was
scheduled for the last snow season. It is
now expected to be completed for the
1964 season.
The ss. ordinary shares are now
around 3s. 4d.
No Change for Hooker F.
A fter reducing tax and amortisation
of pre-acquisition tax losses by
£5,428 to £15,574, Hooker Finance Co.
Ltd showed a similar net profit of
£60,442 for the six months to December,
1963, as in the previous corresponding
period.
Directors said the volume of selective
acceptance business was satisfactory, the
liquidity position sound, and funds from
the current debenture issue were being
fully employed.
For the years 1961-62 and 1962-63,
earning rate was 11.4 p.c. on capital of
£1,075,000.
After Squatting’s Bonus . . . What?
A one-for-one bonus issue planned
for next month, coupled with
doublings of earning rate from 13.6 to
27.3 p.c. and the dividend from 124 to
25 p.c. in the year to December 31,
would gladden the hearts of shareholders
in any company. This has happened in
the case of Squatting Investment whose
directors had led shareholders to expect
results such as these to justify their
refusal to recommend an offer made last

The directors’ justification has been

Predictions Come True
investment analysts who were
recommending the bigger quarrying
stocks at the end of last year as good
prospects for recovery can now breathe
easily. Consolidated Quarries has an-
nounced a 48 p.c. pre-tax profit increase
for the December half-year.
More important than this is the pro-
posed payment of a steady 5 p.c. interim
on capital increased by a two-for-five
premium issue and note conversion. It
requires £27,680 compared with £16,200
in 1962-63, but is still easily covered by
approximate earnings of £56,032 after
tax in the half-year which equals an
annual earning rate of 19.5 p.c. Earn-
ings in the last full year equalled only
17.8 p.c. on capital at £60,871.
The half-year profit is based on the
pre-tax figure supplied by the company
less normal company rates of Bs. in the
£l. However, the tax-bill could be lower
this year after allowances for the
£300,000 development programme are
accounted for.
Reading between the lines, this re-
covery is found to be not entirely the
result of better trading conditions. It
also reflects the acquisition last June of
Willis Quarries Pty Ltd. Nevertheless,
it is a pretty good effort to lift pre-tax
profit by 48 p.c. from a sales increase
of only 18 p.c.
Profit margins have been lowered in
the industry following official cessation
of stabilised selling prices. The com-
pany should, however, see reduced pro-
duction costs once the development pro-
gramme is finished although the earning
rate will undoubtedly suffer in the mean-
time.
The acquisition of the interests and
plant of Earthworks and Quarries will
tighten the company’s control over Mel-
bourne’s stone resources and should
ultimately strengthen its potential as a
profit earner.
Record Result Ahead?
Crosby, Melbourne-based
" merchant and shipping agent, is
well set for a sizeable profit jump in the
current year. It could even be as good
as the 1959-60 result which scored a 40
p.c. increase from £BO,OOO to £122,000
in round figures.
Since then earnings have moved
variably between that figure and the
£122,430 of 1961-62. But the 1963-64
interim report says profit was “sub-
stantially greater” than in the same
period of 1962-63. One of the chief
reasons was the inclusion of figures from
some recently acquired subsidiaries.
Although the interim dividend is
steady at 4 p.c., a good final result could
encourage directors to lift the full year’s
payout to more than last year’s 10 p.c.
This was the first increase in the com-
pany’s history—Bl p.c. had been paid
every year since listing in 1954.
Early Issue From Cellulose?
T'he fact that Cellulose Australia Ltd
A earned lower profit despite sharp
increases in output and sales in the six
months to December 31, 1963, may be
accounted for by a return to tax pro-
visions. In 1962-63 allowances in


respect of investment in plant eliminated
any liability for tax, and the profit of
£272,334 was 18.6 p.c. on capital.
No reference was made in the 1962-
63 accounts as to commitments for
capital expenditure in the current year.
The usual 5 p.c. interim dividend has
been declared for the first half of 1963-
64.
At present the ss. shares bring around
11s. sd. to yield 4.4 p.c. On paper the
company revealed a scarcity of working
capital last June 30. Shareholders are
wondering if an early issue will supple-
ment this income yield.

•*-* rate after a lapse to 5 p.c. last year

At last October’s annual meeting the
chairman (Mr Raymont Moore) said the
company’s long-range prospects depended
on the determination of a form of tariff
which would give relief from trading
practices of some overseas suppliers.
The 20s. shares moved up 2s. on quote
to 14s. 6d. buyer.
Sears Sells Up
Official Manager of G. H. Sears
A Holdings Ltd, Sydney heating and
ventilating engineer, has reported that
when the tangible assets of subsidiaries
are realised, there will be about £22,000
in kitty. If the subsidiaries can be sold
for their tax losses another £6OOO could
be available.
The sum of £28,000 to distribute
amongst holders of the £225,000 capital
represents approximately 2s. 6d. per
20s. share.
The heat has been on in the air-con-
ditioning industry, so much so that
Sears recorded losses totalling about
£250,000 in the last three years.
Competition could not be handled
with profitable results, so present policy
is cessation of contracts and realisation
of all assets.
The only contracts left are the final
stages of the air-conditioning and venti-
lating systems in Menzies Hotel
(Sydney).
No offers have yet been made for the
modern sheet metal factory at Arncliffe.
“A merger with some profitable
organisation could prove possible,” the
Official Manager said.
Former Glory Regained
/Chairman of Taubmans Industries Ltd
(Mr E. G. F. Horne) in his annual
review is concerned about the trend to
the use of many new materials in build-
ing and construction which do not need
painting. The company is therefore
looking for other avenues to compen-
sate for this potential market loss.
The tempo of building rose in the
year ended December 31, 1963, in both
Australia and New Zealand, and this
activity was most marked in the Govern-
ment sector.
Transfer from St Peters to Villawood
of warehousing and distribution facilities
for decorative paint will be accomplished
this year, resulting in considerable cost
savings.
Profit was virtually unchanged at
£455,434, representing 19.2 p.c. on
capital, after smaller ppdvisions for tax
and depreciation.
The ss. shares continue strong at
17s. 3d. The peak last year of 17s. 6d.
was about ss. higher than the upper limit
for the previous five years. It is cheer-
ing to see an old favorite recover its
former glory.
From Strength to Strength
T ast week’s interim report from A. V.
Jennings, Melbourne-based building
contractor and developer, shows that the
company is moving from strength to
strength. The current year will cer-
tainly see the record 27.5 p.c. earning
rate of 1959-60 topped for the first time.
The 1960 credit squeeze dragged it
down to 5.9 p.c. in 1960-61 and it has
since strengthened to 17.9 p.c. in 1961-
62 and 25.6 p.c. last year.
The report revealed substantial in-
creases in sales and profits over the
previous half-year, and announced a
dividend lift which indicated a yearly
12 p.c. as against 11 p.c. previously.
Pre-tax profit came out at £256,848
compared with £180,736 previously and
directors predicted a continuance of this
trend.
A day after the interim report came
the announcement of a one-for-four
share issue at ss. premium. The issue,
widely forecast among share analysts,
will lift ordinary capital by £287,500 to
£1,348,750. Preference holders will be
able to participate, too, and will receive
one ss. ordinary share at ss. premium
for every two £1 preference shares held.
Ghosts From the Past
llTith cash flowing in at the rate of
" £l2 million a year from loan re-
payments and interest, Deposit and In-
vestment Co. Ltd clearly has the where-
withal for big business. The market is,
however, still very sensitive about bad
debts after last year’s write-off of
nearly £600,000.
Interim news last week of a continu-
ance of losses through bad debts on
advances made prior to December,
1962, did nothing to relieve this con-
dition. The shares withered to Bs., where
the yield on dividend, reduced from 15
to 10 p.c., is 6.3 p.c.
Directors report that profit for the
December half-year was adversely
affected by more bad debts, but they
made no comparison of the net trading
result with the previous half-year.
In the first half of the year a more
selective lending policy resulted in a
slight reduction in total advances,
although gross interest earnings showed
some improvement.
A shift in accent to freehold mortgages
and bridging finance since January,
1963, is reported.
Directors are confident that the re-
organisation achieved and a more
selective lending policy will minimise
bad debts, but the mighty fall last year
will not be forgotten quickly by the
market.
Conkey Confidence
\ premium placement of 100,000 ss.
shares and a one-for-eight par issue
of 80,000 shares will raise about half
the funds required by Conkey and Sons
Ltd, meat wholesaler based at Coota-
mundra (NSW).
The company is chasing North
American and Japanese markets for
boneless beef and mutton, and to do this
must spend about £200,000 in the next
15 months on facilities to conform with
the requirements of the US Department
of Agriculture.
As the ss. shares had been bringing
about 145., the placement may have
raised close on £70,000, but the par issue
on the enlarged capital of £160,000 will
bring in only £20.000. It will be made
to shareholders at the close of the
current year to June 30.
The market showed its surprise by
jumping the shares up to 16s. 9d. on
receipt of the news.
Another Record for Nat. Cons.?
Vlational Consolidated is heading
for another record profit in the
current year. Trading in the December
six months by this large automotive, heat
transfer and metal parts manufacturer,
bearing distributor and greeting card
manufacturer produced a profit increase
of 14.3 p.c.
In line with the directors’ forecasts in
the 1962-63 annual report, the bearing
service group and the Murfett greeting
card group scored worthwhile improve-
ments.
If the year does turn out as success-
ful as directors predict, then shareholders
may be in for some extra benefits. They
have received nothing capital-wise since
1958-59 (when a one-for-two bonus was
made) and nothing dividend-wise since
the rate was lifted from 13J to 20 p.c.
in 1957-58.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Changed Opinions of CSR
Reclassified now as a growth stock
Rarely has investment opinion changed
so rapidly regarding any stock as
it has in the case of CSR. Two news-
paper headlines, one in mid-July, 1962,
and another in mid-November, 1963,
seem to adequately sum up investment
opinion at the time.
The July, 1962, line reads, “Colonial
Sugar Refining is not now a growth
stock.”
The November, 1963, line reads,
“CSR to lead growth.”
The price of the shares at the time
of the first headline was 565. 3d. on
an ex rights basis, as the rights issue
was made at the end of July, 1962;
and at the time of the second headline
it was 79s. —a rise of over 40 p.c. in less
than 18 months.
It will be interesting to examine in a
brief way whether the present market
views regarding the stock are justified
since the yield is now very low at 2\ p.c.
This yield indicates that the company
has certainly been reclassified as a
growth stock and it will be interesting
to try to ascertain whether this re-
appraisal is justified.
There can be little doubt that a great
deal of weight has rightly been placed
on the immediate future for the com-
pany’s profits arising from the sub-
stantial rise in the world price of sugar.
From the point of view of the long-term
investor, he can hardly ignore the fact
that, from the graph produced in the
company's last chairman's address, this
price has been around £stg3o since
the end of World War II with peaks
rising up to about £5O at the time
of the Korean war and the Suez crisis.
rrhus address, in a most lucid disserta-
A tion on “The Changing World Sugar
Situation”, goes on to point out that
the “world free market” handles only
about 10 p.c. of the world consumption
of sugar and that the prices on this mar-
ket will fluctuate widely if supply and
demand become unbalanced (as they ap-
pear to have done during 1962-63 main-
ly as a result of the Cuban situation).
Judging by the figures given in CSR’s
report and in their booklet “Notes on
the Australian Sugar Industry”, the pro-
portion of Australian sugar production
which could be offered for sale at the
world free price would be about 45 p.c.,
depending on the size of the crop.
The suggested expenditure of £l5
million on milling capacity over the next
two years seems to suggest that the
millers are preparing for quite substantial
increases in the size of the crop, which
produced about 1.7 million tons of raw
sugar in 1963, and slightly higher than
this in 1962.
The 1962 figure was almost exactly
double the 1950 figure, but the most
significant statistic is that the exportable
sugar more than trebled over this period
—from just over 400,000 tons in 1950
to 1,250,000 tons in 1962. So far as
current conditions are concerned,
perhaps the most significant factor is
that of the exportable sugar, approxi-
mately 800,000 tons will be sold on the
world free market at what can be antici-
pated to be rather high price levels.
For a period of four years the com-
pany showed its three-year average sales
in relation to dividends from the 1957
year to the 1960 year inclusive. This
has since been discontinued, but for the
purpose of studying a few trends these
figures have been included in the follow-
ing table, together with the value of
Australian sugar production, the value
of Australian sugar exports and CSR's
disclosed earnings:—
Value Value
Aust. Aust. CSR
CSR Sugar Sugar Disclosed

1960- N.A. 121 111 163
1961- N.A. 139 138 194
llThile there may be some anomalies
” arising from the takeover of the
Masonite company in 1959, it does seem
apparent that earnings have been in-
creasing at a greater rate than sales and
also at a greater rate than the value
of Australian sugar production or sugar
exports. It also seems fairly clear that
the quite sudden lift in the value of
exports in the last period also produced
a quite sudden rise in earnings so far
as the company was concerned.
Even given the fact that the improve-
ment in the world free price of sugar,
coupled with perhaps increasing demand
from certain Asian countries, is likely
to have a beneficial effect on CSR
earnings, it is still difficult to decide the
likely extent of this effect in the long
run.
Over the last ten years dividend
income to shareholders has increased at
the average annual compound rate of
3i p.c. per annum, although it must be
admitted that in the last five years this
rate has increased to an average annual
compound rate of 4\ p.c. per annum.
Nevertheless, with the shares currently
showing a 2i p.c. yield, a far greater
compound rate of growth is necessary
than either of these figures to justify this
yield from the point of view of a long-
term investor purchasing at present levels.
During this ten-year period the
dividend rate has been increased from
9 p.c. to 10 p.c., but in between a one-
for-three bonus issue has been made.
Judging by the movements in the
different rates, it seems quite likely that
the board would pass on dividend in-
creases to shareholders as profits increase.
'E'or those who are concerned at the
high price of the shares at present,
it may perhaps be pointed out that CSR's
ordinary shares were selling at precisely
the same level in 1934, just prior to the
one-for-one bonus issue in that year, but
with a proportionate reduction in the
dividend rate. So even in those days it
would seem that CSR was often priced
to show a yield of just about 3 p.c.
from the current dividend rate.
A great deal will depend on the
immediate future and whether higher
earnings will produce a fairly substantial
lift in the dividend payout. In the long
term, there is little doubt that increasing
earnings from other divisions will
cushion any fall in sugar prices.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Big Value in Big Sister
14 year history of self-generated growth
Ane of the safest and most rewarding
stocks listed on Sydney Exchange is
Big Sister Foods Ltd.
As a food manufacturer and exporter
it is a good defensive stock in times of
recession, and it now has a 14-year
history of self-generated growth.
Born in March, 1945, the company
was registered on Sydney Exchange in
June, 1950, as Lillis and Co. Ltd. In
1958 the name was changed to its
present style, to correspond with its
trade mark —a move which other traders
could copy for easier identification.
Its present product range includes
fruit cakes, canned plum puddings and
rolls, cherries, ginger, citrus peel, pre-
pared fruit mixes, glucose jelly crystals,
fruit juice concentrate, mushrooms, and
condiments. These are produced at the
Sydney suburb of Balmain.
They are well accepted by the Aus-
tralian grocery trade, and are finding
markets in South-East Asia, East Africa
and the Pacific Islands.
A one-for-three bonus was made in
October, 1958, and a one-for-four in
March, 1962. Shareholders have not
been asked to subscribe to any share
issues, and the company has not worked
on a bank overdraft or borrowed funds
since 1950.
Profit for the last year to June 30
rose 20 p.c. from £80,212 to £95,674,
after providing £22,151 for deprecia-
tion and £61,500 for tax (both sub-
stantial increases).
Earning rate on steady capital was
up from 32.1 to 38.6 p.c. The return
on shareholders’ funds was 14.2 p.c.
Big Sister has only one subsidiary,
the Beattie Carrying Co. Pty Ltd, which
it acquired in 1960-61 for cash. Its
consolidation brought into the accounts
an intangible asset of £129,998 rep-
resenting the difference between par and
book value of the shares. This was
eliminated in 1962-63 by revaluing
the subsidiary’s freehold property by
£131,449, £129,998 of which was
declared as a bonus issue to the parent.
Stocks and debtors at June 30, 1963,
both showed appreciable increases over
the last year, reflecting the higher tempo
of business. At the annual meeting in
October, shareholders were informed
that sales in the opening months of
1963-64 showed an increase over the
previous year.
The factory extensions which were
contemplated were deferred because of
certain difficulties which directors
believe are now likely to be overcome.
If so, they expect to start soon on the
new project. Directors did not elaborate
to shareholders on the nature of the
difficulties.
The build-up in shares, stocks and
deposits with listed companies, from
£92,758 in 1962 to £172,593 in 1963,
is presumably an accumulation of ready
funds for the factory extensions. The
company’s rate of plough-back should
cover any likely capital expenditure in
excess of this sum.
Annual profit increases have become
the accepted thing from Big Sister. The
dividend history was 10 p.c. for the first
eight public years, 12i p.c. in 1958-59,
15 p.c. thereafter.
Distributions by way of bonus scrip
are more judicious and acceptable than
any advance on the 15 p.c. dividend rate.
The relatively small capital keeps the
price of the shares pretty firm. The ss.
units are currently available at 375. 6d.
where the yield is a tiny 2.0 p.c.
Unfortunately for the get-rich-quick
merchant, the merits of the stock are
well known, as witness the lengthening
price - earnings ratio. Although there
may be another couple of shillings in
the shares over the next few months, the
low income yield demands more than
a temporary holding.
It is possible also that the return on
shareholders’ funds may fall off now,
the company having passed the point of
easy growth. Mention was made in the
1961-62 annual address that trading
conditions were more competitive than
for many years past.

CLIFFORD LOVE AND CO. LTD
Mild Oats for Uncle Toby
since the four-for-five bonus issue
in October, 1955, Clifford Love and
Co. Ltd has been struggling to present a
respectable earning rate to the business
world.
The very high prices prevailing for all
grains used by the group in the last year
to September 30 made this something of
a losing battle.
In the event, profit of £72,843 was a
mere 6.6 p.c. on slightly increased
capital, and although dividend was re-
duced from 81 to 7i p.c., this still
meant dipping into kitty to satisfy
dividend obligations.
Clifford Love has mills at Enfield and
Lane Cove in the Sydney metropolitan
area, and at Cootamundra in southern
NSW producing packaged cornflour,
starch, custard powder, rice and rolled
oats, such industrial products as starch,
dextrines, adhesives, wheat gluten and
flour, and animal feeds.
Corn Products International, a division
of Corn Products Co. of America, under
a manufacturing agreement made in
1961, gives assistance to Clifford Love
in the manufacture of cornflour, starch
and industrial commodities, and in the
planned expansion for both food and in-
dustrial products.
The shortage of maize and its high
price in 1962-63, however, adversely
affected this development.
The company moved into Western
Australia by the purchase in March,


1962, of all the assets of National
Trading Co. Pty Ltd of Perth and
Albany, and by the takeover in June,
1963, of Snaps Dog Foods Pty Ltd.
CLIFFORD LOVE 8t CO. LTD.
Directors say crop forecasts for the
next oat harvest are good, and that the
company is taking vigorous action to
secure export business in the north.
No benefits are yet visible to share-
holders from the association with the
American company, and there are no
other grounds for great optimism about
the company as an investment prospect.
The ss. shares are therefore generously
priced at 7s. Id. to yield 5.3 p.c.

WM. HAUGHTON & CO. LTD
Directors Frank and Cautious
nPHE recession in the woollen textile
A industry since removal of import
restrictions in 1960 has had a serious
adverse effect on Wm. Haughton and
Co. Ltd. A resounding loss in 1961-62
and no ordinary dividends for the last
three years brought the Melbourne
market for the 20s. ordinary shares as
low as 12s. 6d. during 1962.
Then a distinct recovery in earnings
for the last year to June 30—a profit of
£120,893 was recorded—convinced share-
holders that the rot had stopped, and
they began to demand almost par value
for their shares.
Last week's interim report for the first
half of the 1963-64 year confirmed the
improvement and directors gave an “en-
couraging” estimate for the second half.
Two-thirds of Haughton’s activities
are concerned with wool —as buying
brokers, buying for mills and merchants
(quite distinct from a selling broker’s
function), as manufacturers of wooltops,
exporters of sheepskins, futures brokers,
wool dumpers and so on.
One-third of its business is with cattle
hides, furred skins, timber, shipping and
travel, insurance and general merchan-
dise.
Exports account for two-thirds of the
Australian activity, and imports and
local trade for the remainder. The pro-
portion of exports is higher in New
Zealand.
Other activities are listed as shipping
and travel agents, ship charterers,
marine insurance underwriters (UK),
insurance agents, property salesmen,
timber selling agents and importers, saw-
millers, and distributors of fencing and
building materials, Lysaght’s galvanised
iron, aluminiumware and agricultural
chemicals.
Directors were at pains to explain the
nature of their activities, and this effort
is highly commendable. The nature of
a business can change over the years,
and new shareholders often have only
a vague idea of the type of business
done. The relative importance of the
various sections of a widespread business
is of great interest to shareholders, and
their sole service for this information is
in most cases from directors themselves.
The company or its subsidiaries are
floor members of the London Wool
Terminal Market Association (Wool
Futures), floor members of the Sydney
Greasy Wool Futures Exchange, and
associate members (wool) of the New
York Cotton Exchange.
Although business is still highly com-
petitive and subject to world price
movements which are often sudden in
, impact, commodity prices are at present
favorable.
Cutting out unprofitable operations
(for instance, the physical handling of
hides in NZ) and tighter management
controls have also contributed to the
trading recovery.
Hide prices continue to fall all over
the world because of increased supplies
and the further development of artificial
leathers. Directors described trading
difficulties in this department as
“extreme”.
The tops-making subsidiary, Port
Phillip Mills Pty Ltd, made an important
contribution to group profits.
Stocks have been reduced from
£2,933,542 to £2,749,985, while debtors
have grown from £2,757,066 to
£2,991,304; both signs of healthier
trading.
Liquidity has been improved slightly
in 1962-63 by the exercise of restraint
on capital expenditure, and the with-
drawal of investment in unprofitable
activities.
The company has about £i million
in term liabilities, and is carrying an
overdraft of close on £4 million. The
overdraft has increased by £1.5 million
in five years, and until this is reduced
to reasonable proportions, the company
will not inspire any great confidence in
investors.
Asked at the annual meeting about the
possibility of an interim dividend in
1963-64, the chairman made no
promises.
With unusual candour, he pointed
out that the good years have not
compensated for the inroads on share-
holders’ funds of the bad years.
Directors have therefore had to take the
WM. HAUGHTON & CO. LTD.
long-term view in safeguarding and
developing assets and earning power.
Thus shareholders could almost take
it that directors would not be bustled
into paying an early dividend and they
would only recommend one when actual
earnings and future prospects really
warrant such confidence.
The shares have now moved to
19s. 6d. or thereabouts. There they

should remain until more definite divi-
dend indications.
Investors, though, may soon appreciate
directors’ caution in waiting for full
1963-64 results before a premature
excursion to the dividend lists.

Tour Finance Recovers
HThe unfortunates who paid ss. for Tour
Finance shares in the original float
of June, 1962, may recoup their losses
this year if the full 1963-64 result is in
line with the recovery shown in the
latest six months to December 31.
The scrip touched a peak of ss. 3d.
soon after the Melbourne listing in
September, 1962, but a low of 3s. pre-
vailed for most of 1963.
Investors took a poor view of this
small financier and the first year’s result
justified their outlook. After predicting
earnings which would cover the payment
of “at least” a 10 p.c. dividend, directors
announced a profit of £7030 for 1962-63
and a dividend of 5 p.c. which was
covered only 1.1 times.
But firings should be different this
year. In the six months term just passed,
net profit was more Jhan doubled when
compared with the same period of 1962.
SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Ready Mixed Mutiny
Shareholders on the march
T unchtime crowds must have been
puzzled by the movement of troops
(apparently disguised in civilian clothing)
from downtown to uptown last Monday,
They were, of course, RMC shareholders
making their way to do battle at the
Trocadero.
Apart from the members of the RMC
board, the proposition of a new develop-
ment company had met with almost
universal opposition since it was an-
nounced about a month ago. Using large
monetary accessions for development is
one thing; arbitrary and incompletely
disclosed plans proceeding solely from
directors are another.
In theory, as directors are appointed
by the shareholders, they should take
note of shareholder opinion. If not
before, then at the meeting last Monday,
directors should have realised the strong
and united disapproval that shareholders
felt for the formation of the new com-
pany.
I was immensely pleased when I learnt
that the motion had been defeated.
Closer to home was the rise in the
Santos shares. I’d paid 16s. for these
shares last week. Some readers who
invest from this column must have been
upset to see the market price of Santos
was 18s. 3d. on the day of publication.
It is to be stressed that my trans-
actions always relate to the previous
week. Hence, had anyone followed this
column blindly, I could have been sell-
ing them at 18s. 3d. if I’d thought the
rise of 2s. 3d. was sufficient. The price
of a share more often dictates my pur-
chase than the quality of a share.
But I waited until the market hit 20s.
on the Thursday before I sold off 400
of them. A profit of £63 in less than a
week was very satisfying. Because I was
still holding a balance of 200, it Was
not such a great blow to watch them
rise a further Is. 6d. on the day.
Perhaps it was this temporary success
in oil that made me come back into Mid-
Eastern Oil. Only a month ago I had
sold out of 2000 at 2s. 3d. taking a loss
of £44. Now the share price is down to
Is. 7d., the same price as before the call
of Is. was made late last year. So once
again I became the owner of 2000 shares
a lot of shares but the cost was only
£l6B.
Waugh and Josephson was another
price situation. In a flurry the shares
rose to 225. 6d. but then receded to
20s. 6d. My order for 200 caught them
on the rebound at 21s.
It may seem a lot to pay for a com-
pany which showed a loss of £266,000
last year. But that was the year of
getting the house in order stock
written down, bad debts fully accounted
and the unsuccessful diversification
activities sold off. Back to the task of
concentrating on the Caterpillar and
John Deere agencies, W. & J. could have
a very good year. The interim report
should be out shortly.
Already out with an interim report is
Conkeys, Cootamundra - based whole-
sale butcher. Directors reported that
turnover of the company had shown a
substantial increase with a corresponding
increase in profit. As last year’s earning
rate was 28.3 p.c., it could well be in
the middle thirties this year.
With the announcement of the cash
issue, the shares came back to 15s. 3d.
If anything the issue should improve the
market standing of this promising little
company. I bought 800 shares.
To counteract this buying spree, I
sold out the 200 Pioneer Sugar at 635.,
taking a nice little profit of £33. With-
out a sugar share in it, the portfolio
looks somewhat bare.
Transactions for the week were:

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Bolte and the Wool Men
The importance of Portland
Tt took a Board of Inquiry to do it,
but Portland (Vic.) now has its wool
sales. One-day sales have now been held
in November and December last year
and February this year with more
scheduled for March, April, May and
July.
This month’s sale went off with little
fuss or bother and the newspaper re-
porters from the Melbourne dailies
stayed away.
The sale happened to clash with one
of the big days at Geelong, but that sort
of thing has to be expected. The National
Council of Wool Selling Brokers had
warned that the allocation of dates for
Portland would remain a problem re-
gardless of what the Board of Inquiry
said about it.
Portland is important . . . not only to
the people who live there and the people
who sell their wool there. It is important
because, if Portland fails to develop, the
cause of decentralisation will suffer.
The future of all the other “might be”
ports on the Australian coast such as
Iluka, Twofold Bay, Grafton, Coff’s
Harbor, Port Stephens and Port Mac-
quarie will be affected by what happens
at Portland.
"Portland’s future as a wool selling
centre brightened considerably with
the announcement in Melbourne by the
chairman and managing director of The
Australian Estates Co. Ltd, Sir Denys
Lowson, that his firm would build a
£500,000 wool store there.
This means that next wool selling
season Portland will have sales con-
ducted by Australian Estates, Portland
Wool Brokers Ltd and the giants Dalgety-
New Zealand Loan and Elder Smith-
Goldsbrough Mort who have started
work on a wool store at Portland.
At present Portland Wool Brokers Ltd
is the only firm conducting sales at Port-
land and is expected to handle about
35,000 bales this season.
Prices so far have not been too favor-
able compared with Geelong. But Sir
Denys, a former Lord Mayor of London
who makes fairly frequent trips to inspect
his firm’s holdings in Australia, said this
was only to be expected. One firm,
operating alone, had the job ahead of it.
Australian Estates expects to sell some
30,000 bales at Portland next season.
Added to Portland Wool Brokers sale,
and the bigger sales of Dalgety’s and
Elder’s, the total for Portland next
season could exceed 140,000 bales.
Australian Estates have everything to
gain and nothing to lose by supporting
Portland. Excavation has already com-
menced at their Portland site.
An oil terminal, a tanker berth, and
a fish cannery have been built at Port-
land since the port was opened in 1960.
There is talk of a meatworks, a super-
phosphate works, a cellophane plant
and silos for wheat.
HThe harbor works cost about £6£
A million, £1 million more than the
estimate. The State Government pro-
vided £2 million, while £4i million was
obtained on the open loan market. There
was strong support for the loan from
local people and institutions.
The Portland Harbor Trust has to
earn about £500,000 a year to pay its
way and since 1960 the earnings have
provided only a fraction of this. Next
year, however, should see something like
a proper utilisation of the port by
shipping.
Critics of Henry Bolte’s Government
say it erred in not providing a Govern-
ment-subsidised industry to back up the
port project. But in 1951, when work
commenced on the new breakwater,
Victoria was enjoying a heady inflow of
overseas capital and it seemed certain
that Portland would get its share.
By 1960, when the most popular of
all Governors, Sir Dallas Brooks,
opened the new port with appropriate
color supplied by a RAN frigate and a
US icebreaker, the inflow had subsided
somewhat. Nevertheless, it was a great
day for Portland and for go-ahead Vic-
toria. And nobody had any idea of the
near-disaster that was to follow.
It is history that, despite the fine deep-
water port, the established wool-broking
firms showed no interest in conducting
sales at Portland (although most bought
land there presumably to be on the safe
side).
But a “new boy”, Portland Wool
Brokers Ltd, based in London, stepped
in and organised a sale in 1961. Wool
buyers, in compliance with the “old”
brokers’ desires, boycotted the 1961 sale.
There was a near riot in Portland
itself, months of speech making and
deputations, and finally the Board of
Inquiry in 1962/63 which found that
while no one could force buyers to
attend, no one could force them not
to, either.
Mr Bolte, acting on the finding, had
a bill prepared to “ensure w 7 ool sales
for Portland”, but didn’t proceed with
it when the brokers and buyers with-
drew their opposition.
The brokers were able, by doing the
“right thing”, to restore their public
image which had sunk so low that even
the Bishop of Ballarat publicly castigated
them.
Tt is just as well for Portland that three
-*• major brokers will sell next season
in addition to Portland Wool Brokers.
This month's Portland sale could have
been better. At Geelong it was a top-
notcher. Rather incredibly the top lots at
each sale came from almost adjoining
properties at Victoria Valley, near
Dunkeld, in the Western District.
At Geelong merino fleece from Sierra
Park, Victoria Valley, brought 350 d. a
pound. At Portland merino fleece from
Wattlebreae, Victoria Valley, brought
llOd. a pound. The fleeces were
obviously of different quality, but never-
theless the prices were significant.
A better comparison was probably the
160 d. for Merino lambs at Geelong,
compared with 106 d. at Portland, and
comeback at 106 d. (Geelong) against
IOOd. (Portland).
But with lower freight rates for hinter-
land properties using Portland, and with
a bigger offering next season, the gap
should be closed.
If ever a place should succeed, on
paper, it is Portland. It is the natural
outlet for an area which produces
450,000 bales of the best wool in Aus-
tralia every year.
The Western District, too, is far from
being a solely squatters’ empire, although
it still does have some properties in
the 20,000 acres class. But it also has
soldier settlers, dairy farmers, oat
growers, onion growers and it is in a
direct line south from the wheat country.
The bigger towns, Warrnambool,
Hamilton and others, are not one-horse
by any means. Portland may not be out
of trouble yet, but at least it is on the
way.

The Baffling Pink Eye
Do improved pastures cause it?
Tn farming, as indeed with most other
things, there rarely appears to be a
clear-cut solution to any problem. The
problem is replaced by a new one which
no one envisaged at the time . . . and
so it goes on.
The squatters solved the problem of
maintaining their production by moving
on to new leases and in their crude way
practised a form of pasture improve-
ment by burning the scrub to promote
green growth the following spring.
The selectors, not being able to move
on, had a bigger burn by first ring-
barking, then feeling or grubbing out the
trees.
After the First World War superphos-
phate became the standard method of
pasture improvement and for that matter
in many parts of Australia it still is.
But generally speaking, the mere
spreading of “super” these days is not
enough to qualify as pasture improve-
ment. The term now implies the culti-
vation of the land, the sowing of per-
manent pastures of rye, clover, phalaris
and newer grasses and the subsequent
harrowing, fertilisation and topping of
those pastures. Irrigation may come into
it also,
Pasture improvement of this kind has
been pushed along since the war in most
°f the closer settled farming areas, and
with it often has come an upsurge in
insect and ground parasites which find
* n * us ber growth an ideal breeding
ground.
A persistent, and baffling, disease
probably, although not definitely, brought
on by improved pastures is pink eye in
cattle, horses and sheep. Improved
pastures mean longer standing grass and
whether this is the cause or not, it does
aggravate the attacks,
With cattle and horses the disease is
also called blight, ophthalmia or in-
fectious bovine keratitis. Young cattle
are usually more seriously affected than
older because, as they have not been
previously affected, their resistance is
lower.
Attacks are worse when conditions
are dry and there is dust in the air.
Formerly, in cattle and horses, the
disease was thought to be due to an
organism called rickettsia, but it is now
believed to be due to Moraxella bovis.
Penicillin a few years ago was a good
cure. Now penicillin is unreliable.
Chloromycetin, aureomycin and terra-
mycin are being used now with good
results.
These may be inserted by puffer packs
or collapsible tube when the animal is
suitably restrained in a crush. This is
the difficulty, of course. It is easy with
animals which have been handled from
birth but in the case, say, of bullocks
from Central Australia being fattened
for market on a near-metropolitan farm
it can involve much time and labor,
adding to costs.
Animals may get pink eye at different
times and singly or in groups, which
is a further problem.
The eye first becomes red and swollen,
then a whitish film begins to spread
over it and eventually the animal will
become blind. Apparently there is pain
associated with it because badly affected
animals become distraught. They will
crash through fences and are generally
difficult to handle.
In sheep the disease, although it has
the same symptoms, has a different
cause. Rickettsia conjunctivae, a type
of organism within the tissue cell, is
more difficult to reach and does not
respond readily to antibiotics.
Tears that overflow the eye are highly
infectious and can transfer the disease
in two days if another animal comes
into contact.
Lambs are very susceptible and,
becoming blind, they wander from their
mothers. Losses of 20 per cent have
been known
Usually older sheep will recover
normally within six weeks without treat-
ment. In the case of valuable stud
animals eye lotions may be administered.
It is advised that affected sheep be
drafted from the main flock as soon
as they show the symptoms.
An outbreak may be checked by
putting the flock through a race and
administering a lotion to the eyes and
face w'ith a fly spray. The lotion can
be made by taking one ounce of zinc
sulphate and three drams of methylene
blue to one pint water.
Graziers say that a boon to the in-
dustry would be the availability of a
serum which might be injected to make
animals resistant to pink eye attack in
the same way that they are made re-
sistant to tetanus.

Bean Harvester
Does Work of 150
Women Pickers
Qingle and double row harvesters have
been developed in Britain recently
to meet the increasing demand for
dwarf beans by the deep freezing and
canning industries. A double row
machine with two operators harvests up
to one acre an hour, equivalent to the
output of about 150 women pickers.
A harvester and tractor on to which
it is built costs £3500 to £4OOO sterling
and hence, to be an economic proposi-
tion, it must be used intensively during
the season.
Varieties must be grown on which all
the beans mature at the same time. The
beans and leaves are stripped from the
rows of plants and deposited on a
horizontal conveyor by two horizontal
contra-rotating reels with spring-loaded
fingers. Then the leaves and trash are
removed by a high speed air stream
while the beans pass up an inclined
elevator to bags or bulk bins.
Damage and loss of beans on the
ground amounts to from eight p.c. to
15 p.c. of the crop.
Are Artesian Waters
Dwindling?
4 ustralia may be using up its artesian
water supplies quicker than they are
being replenished, says the Journal of
the Australian Institute of Agricultural
Science. It has been estimated that since
1890 over 18.3 million acre-feet of ar-
tesian water has been drawn from the
Great Artesian Basin, which covers 22
p.c. of Australia. In that time only
7.5 million acre-feet have been re-
charged.
In an cttempt to find out whether
these underground water supplies are
being used more quickly than they are
replaced, the Water Research Foundation
of Australia is sponsoring a three-year
programme.
Already six inter-state conferences
have been held to discuss the geological
factors, the design of the bores and the
conservation of artesian water
Methods used in the study of the
rate of replenishment will date the water
from the present day to 50,000 years
ago. The date of the water will be de-
termined by isolating radioactive carbon
particles from samples of artesian water.
N.G. Natives to Chop
at Easter Show
tT'wo New Guinea natives have made
13 entries in the wood-chopping
section of the Sydney Royal Easter Show
—for the first time. Both are from the
wild Sepik River district. Their names
are Karis-Kombi and Pius Mouneia.
Karis, aged about 30, weighs 11 i
stone and is sft. ins. tall. He has won
eight firsts, one second and one third at
Kokopo, Lae, Kaviang and other New
Guinea shows.
Pius, the other entrant, is aged about
23. He took up competitive wood-
chopping only last September and since
then he has won two firsts, two seconds
and three thirds.
The two natives cannot read, write
or speak English. They are not able to
talk together in their own language as
they come from different tribes, but can
understand each other in pidgin English.
Mr Dick Reilly, of the Department of
Forestry at Rabaul, hopes to bring Karis
and Pius to Sydney for a month to show
them some large Australian industrial
undertakings such as the Newcastle and
Port Kembla steelworks.

Humes’ Higher
Hopes
A lthough the performance of Humes
Ltd was not particularly brilliant in
the half-year to December 31, the
results for the current six months should
help lift the final figures to a considerably
higher level than those of 1962-63.
The recent interim report disclosed a
small pre-tax profit increase by the
parent company from £550,000 to
£580,000 —in the half-year and also
gave figures for sales which were down
very slightly while orders on hand at
December 31 were up from £7.5 million
to £8.6 million.
Sales and profits of the subsidiary
companies were described as “slightly
higher”.
Three factors point to considerable
improvement in the current half for this
Melbourne-based manufacturer of con-
crete and steel pipes.
First is the existence of three large
contracts started in the first half but
which have only just got properly under-
way. These are held by the parent com-
pany. Second is the parent’s £8.6 million
of orders which are 14.7 p.c. higher than
in the first term of 1962-63.
The third factor deals with the com-
bined results of the subsidiaries. The
slightly higher profit and sales were
achieved despite the disruption of trading
borne by Martin Stoneware Pipe Pty
Ltd, which commissioned a new
£700,000 clay-pipe factory at Wen-
douree.
Returns from this subsidiary should
rise substantially now that the factory is
producing, but full benefits will not
accrue until 1964-65 because it will take
three or four months for operations to
become fully efficient.
The group’s main problem at present
appears to be the continued losses of an
associate company, Wunderlich Humes
Asbestos Pipes Pty Ltd, in which Humes
has a half-interest, It lost £297,000 in
the year to October 31.
However, recent monthly losses have
been greatly reduced although an
adequate sales volume is still lacking.
The owners are continuing with
remedial measures and Humes intends to
make a revaluation of its investment at
next balance date.
Record Holden Year
fTHE success of the big-engined EH
Holden introduced by General
Motors last August is reflected in the
demand and production records achieved
by the company in 1963.
Local and overseas demand created
a production lift of 26,655 units over the
previous record set in 1960 of 139,619.
Exports also touched a new peak.
GMH contributes substantially to
Australia’s export drive and is currently
sending vehicles to 55 countries. Some
are complete and some are partly
knocked-down and assembled at their
destination.
Since exporting started in 1954 more
than £26 million has been earned in
overseas exchange.
