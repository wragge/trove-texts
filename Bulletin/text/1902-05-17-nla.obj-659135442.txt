WILLIAM BLAKE. WALT WHITMAN.
BLAKE is damned handy to steal from.”
So said Fuseli in Blake’s own time-
which time was ’twixt 1757 and 1827.
~ . ._Whitman was born in 1819, and
died m 1892. He, soul son and heir of Blake, took
up his inheritance in another land, in happier
times.
To the world Blake was lost ’till in the fifties of
the last century. Alexander Gilchrist began, the
Rossettis continued, and Swinburne completed a
work of resurrection and interpretation which
makes plain a man, who in art and letters was
chief of his age; who saw, understood, and
imagined more than any of that age ; who reached
° U j uiore boldly and farther into the actual verities
and infinities than any who have been since.
Son of a hosier in London, Blake, apprenticed
to an engraver, painted strange, and wrote mad
things, none too modest or seemly. Used to sit
with his wife in the costume of Adam and Eve
(before the fall), claimed that the prophets Isaiah
and Ezekiel dined with him, that the Ancient of
Days looked in through his chamber window ;
came near being hanged for sedition, behaved dis-
respectfully to the patron who saved him ; roared
fir Liberty lustily and always. S° the world
spoke—often lying; and why should the world
hold such a one in any tender regard ?
But Fuseli knew and used him in life, Flaxinan
and Stoddart also. Later on, the Rossettis, both
as painters and poets. Gustave Dore took more
from him than he himself could give again to
the world. Watts sat at his feet ere he painted that
great picture of “ Mammon ” ; Carlyle struck in
one deep root : Emerson gained assurance and
bj-eadth ; and a half-score of German philosophers,
ISeitzsche the latest, found stuff for their webs in
scraps of his visions. And, there is Whitman.
V. i thout Blake, Whitman had not been.
Blake was a heretic, utter and complete as
Marcion or Arius or Manes. Any inquisitor, any
Chri V ian unrestrained, would have burned, as a
g’ood Tory Government tried to hang him. He.
pulled down worshipful virtues one after another,
stripped them of their masks and disguises, and
set up their naked, often ghastly, realities, to
shock and scandalise unnumbered congregations.
Modesty was to him a “timid and tacit pru-
rience” ; humility a “ mistrustful and mend ir-'o.is
condition.” Thankfulness, begotten of humility,
liked him no better.
Since all the riches of the world
Mxv bs gifts from the Devil or earthly kings,
I should suspect that I worshipped the Devil
If I thanked my God for worldly things.
For himself he knew “no other Christianity
and no other Gospel than the liberty of both mind
and body to exercise the Divine art of imagina-
tion.” His was a complex, seismic temperament,
and yet his life, as now bared in all its details, was
pure, laborious, honorable. But for his heresies
he might have had an early fame equal to that of
Oowper, the “teapot pietist,” or of Paine, the
dealer out of tape-yard infidelities.” In the
beginning his verse had the sweetness of Herrick,
the felicity of Keats—
Smile on our love and while thou drn west round
The sky’s blue, curtain, scatter silver dew
On every flower that closest its sweet eyes
l.n fiinely sleep. • Let the west wind sleep on
The lake. Speak silence with thy glimmering eyes
And wash the dusk with silver.
No possibility of mistaking quality there. It
shines true gold in every aspect But, *alas, there
were other things even so early :
A little black thing amongst the snow,
Crying weep ! weep ! in tones of woe.
Where are your father and mother say?
“They are gone up to the church to pray.”
At a very early date distressing complexities of
that sort intruded on his visions, though years
passed before in his strongest verse he put the
final question:
Tiger! tiger ! burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What Irtimortal hand and eye,
Framed thy fearful symmetry?
In what distant depths or skies
Burned that fire within thine eyes?
On what wings dared He aspire?
What the hand dared seize that fire ?
When the stars flung down their spears
And watered Heaven with their tears,
Did He smile His work to see ?
Did He who made the lamb make thee?”
Never since the voice out of the Whirlwind
came to that fearfully bedevilled squatter of
Chaldea have more pregnant words than these
been spoken. The question involved is not of the
origin of evil, but of power-force, living energy
unrestrained and reckless; of that “bit of the
devil,” lacking which no man or woman makes
much in the world.
In the “ Marriage of Heaven and Hell,” Blake
sets himself to answer and expound. First, he
has to state his case, and in that statement are
many amazing things
Better murder an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted
desire.
Prisons are built with stones of law ; brothels with
bricks of religion.
The reason and interpretation of which is, that
the' nursing of unacted desire is the stifling of
! >eific impulse ; the need of prisons is chiefly made
by unnatural law, and the brothel is fed by the
timid and tacit prurience of what is known as
modesty. Blake makes this last matter plainer,
according to his own light, in “ The Everlasting
Gospel.”
In the case of the Woman Taken in Adultery, a
dialogue is imagined. “What was thy love?”
asks the Forgiver. The woman answers—
Love too long from me has fled.
’Twas dark deceit to earn my bread ;
’Twas covet, or ’twas custom, or
Some trifle not worth caring for.
But thin, 0 Lord, this was my sin,
When first I let those Devils in,
in dark pretence to chastity —
Blaspheming love, blaspheming thee.
Thence rose secret adulteries,
And thence did covet also rise;
My sin thou hast forgiven me,
Canst thou forgive my blasphemy ?
The Hell Blake knows and desires to wed with
his Heaven is of active human will, desire, energy,
unrestrained by any “dark pretence.” He deemed
that he beard the banns of that marriage published,
firstly in the tumult of the uprising of the French
nation, secondly the successful revolt of the
American people. A good deal of the confusion
of his later work came through the bitterness born
of the smother of the suppression of the French
upheaval. Thence arose the bewildering riot of
thought and revelation in the prophetic books.
“ Thel ” is plain enough to all who do not hanker
after such “simplicity” as frequently makes
Wo-Is worth and Tennyson puerile. But as to
“Albion,” “Jerusalem,” “ America,” and “Uri-
zen,” it is better for most people to lean oh
Swinburne’s shoulder, as Dante on Virgil’s, and
overlook them. But there is purpose in them all,
and that purpose is the elevation and emancipa-
tion of man. The"e is nothing higher and nothing
lower in this world or in space, in time or eternity.
A God of vengeance or of sacrifice is an inven-
tion. All asceticism is “dark pretence.” Humility
is a trick of “ the ancient elf ” conceived for man’s
degradation. Sweep all away, for by all does the
priest rule, and the king rule, and the law ter-
rorise. Stand upright, assertive beyond all com-
monplace or priest-bouud conception—and the
better day dawns. Such was Blake’s creed, ex-
pressed through “The Everlasting Gospel” and
“ The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.” Only by
the work of his hands could he get a hearing. He
etched his own plates, letterpress and illustration,
printed and bound his own books, and sold them
for daily bread. But in mind he was always
serene, and strong, and brave, and when at length
death tanned, he stretched out his hand joyfully
as did old Coplas de Maurique.
He was accessible enough to steal from through
all those years, and the stealing went on without
much acknowledgment. But about the year 1850
an effort was made by the most active and loyal
spirits of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood to bring
the man and his work out to the light. Alexander
Gilchrist was their medium. And almost exactly
co-incident was the advent of Walt Whitman in
America. The old message was given to the new
world through new lips. It was not well
received. The critics and the purists would
have handed Whitman over to the Holy Office.
But Whitman found a cause well worthy to live
and to die for. He fought, laboured, suffered
through the war, which at least established on a
basis of liberty the Republic, one and indivisible.
And he could see in that establishment full scope
for the realisation of all his vision. Hence all his
channts are jovous, robust, actual, present. He
had not to build up a New Jerusalem. He did
no” dream a dream, and ask, “Shall it be?” or
“ Mxv it be ? ” His assurance is buoyant;—
Come, I will make the continent indissoluble ;
I will m ike the most splendid race the sun has ever yet
shone upon:
I will make divine, magnetic lands.
Whitman knows no evil save of man’s making
or imagining. There is no vice and no vicious
opnortunity where there is no lying nor pretence.
“When man understands himself, he has the
highest possible conception of God.”
What do you suppose will satisfy the soul, except to
will free and own no superior ?
What do yon suppose I would intimate to you in a hun-
dred ways, but that man or woman is as good as God ?
And that there is no God anv more divine than your-
self?
¥ * * *
Oh, the joy of manly selfhood ! Personally to be ser-
vile to none—to defer to nor.e--not to any tyrant, known
or unknown.
• « * *
To confront with your own personality all other per-
sonalities on earth.
That is mental freedom: Bodily liberty is not
less or less plainly expressed. The body can only
be free as it opposes unnatural restrictions and
acts out desire. It is deadly every line of it to
the “gospel ” of modesty, of chastity, of humility,
of thankfulness.
Blake made for himself a hearing, but found in
his own time few if any listeners. Whitman
announced himself, springing a mine under all
conventionalities, and had the satisfaction, after
the shrieks of horror had ceased, of hearing the
question raised: “What does the man mean?” lie
answered, kept on answering, and, as every
succeeding note declared, with unchanging faith
and hope. It is well that he died in 1892, for ere
the last decade of his century closed such things
came to the United States as must have frozen
some at least of the founts of his farthest reach-
ing hopes. No more did the native genius assert :
“Lo I will make a continent one and indissoluble,
divine, magnetic land.” No more was comrade-
ship a universal, all-embracing - word. The
divine magnetic influences were despised ;
suokered tentacles were thrust out to
grasp and to strangle. The very basis of
national unity was suborted and all the maxims of
the fathers of the States despised. In the face of
the suppression of the Filipinos the soul of Whit-
man would stand aghast.
And if Blake should rise again or look out from
the company of the elect, to witness the begin-
nings of another earth century, what would he
behold ? What in England and throughout the
British Empire, but a recrudescence of all the
throne-worship and consequent tyrannoUvS sup-
press ion of human right and national spirit which
bore him down, too, in his own time ?
Easy to imagine the two hoary earth prophets
transformed into mighty Genii of the Infinities’
scattering the dust of which worlds are made on
their heads, rending their garments as the cloud
wrack of a storm is rent, and weeping as the
storm weeps. For must it not appear to them
that their earth teaching was wholly in vain ?
They sought to uplift man and woman as the most
perfect images of God this planet has brought
forth ; to teach them trust in themselves, natural,
beautiful, strong, naked, unashamed. And to
what effect ? The dark pretence still stalks the
world, and sits on the high places of the world.
Ihe social order festers and -rots with the
pruriences bred of the many inventions, the affec-
tations, the artificial restraints. The wheels of
Empire grind over true national spirit in every
land and no voice of Liberty makes protest. But
is all hope lost ?
F. M.
Froissart in 1902.
FCARRIJTHERS GOULD, caricaturist,
is also a writer of some distinction. In
• T roissart’s Modern Chronicles ”he has
, .. , , Siven. in picture and letterpress, a
dehghtfully humorous epitome of two decades of
English history. Here in Australia the book will
be, probably, condemned by Jingoes as vilely
Pro-Boer, because it is truthful in regard to the
S’African war; in England it has been received
with glad
acceptanc e
everywhere.
Both in draw-
ings and let-
terpress Mr.
Gould affects
an archaic
style (that of
Froissart in
the latte r),
and maintains
it artistically
throughout.
This, tor in-
stance, of the
famous confer-
ence between
those two
S’Afriean con-
spirators,
Rhodes and
Chamberlain,
after The
Raid :
To Sir Joseph,
Sir Cecil d e
Kimberley an-
swered : “Si r,
CLERGYMAN DEFYING
BISHOPS.
(From the Modern Froissart.)
of a truth it behoveth you nob to be so reproachful, for
it is your apple-cart as well as mine that hath been put
in peril, and we be both in the same plight, seeing that
neither you nor X had foreknowledge of the enterprise.
Let us rather have pity for each, for we both are in the
same boat.”
Then these two looked one at the other, and sorely
mused, for neither knew how much the other did not
know.
The author covers the whole range of politics in
his 100 pages—Home Rule, the War, the question
of Ritualism—and always with the same light
touch: it is one of the most entertaining books of
the year.
* _
Some correspondents—
P.F.R. gives the other view : I am an Imperialist, but
no Jingo. F. R. is right about the little Greek States,
cradled into originality by impassable mountains. But
perhaps he hasn’t noticed that the electric telegraph has
been invented since then. Also newspapers, railways,
trade-unions, etc. He also carefully forgets that the
Greek democracies were founded on slavery. Easy
enough to have a cultured ruling class, if you can get
work done bv six times as many subject “living tools.”
Our problem is to govern so that there shall be no human
Waste, but all find fit scope for their faculties. This we
are more likely to get as part of a big nation, so
it seems to me. If you can convince me on this
point I will turn Separatist to-morrow. As to
the happiness argument, the first , two' centuries
of the Roman empire are generally conceded to have been,
on the whole, happier for Europe than any two centuries
(of which we have record) preceding it. My case is simply
this : Australia proved she thought life as a part of a big
thing is better than a little life “on one’s own” hy
federating. Why stop there ? We are still English
people. It is better ■politically, socially, mentally, to be
in intimate communion with a great nation, than'to lead
a cloistered, narrow-minded life, “ taking in each other’s
washing.!’,. Why stop there? Ultimately, in the fulness
of time, I look to the “Federation of the World ” of the
poet. That is why I and many others are Imperialists :
we hate the war as much as you do ; we hate English
(and Australian) snobbery as much as you do ; we are as
keen upholders of Australian individuality in art and.
literature. But if Maoriland was wrong in refusing to
federate, how will Australia be right in separating from
England ?

Henri Pene Du Buis, described by a correspon-
dent to The B. as “ the Buskin of America ” (the
blasphemy !), prints every syllable of that terrible
name in large caps over and beneath his articles.
Crushing over Victorian painter Meyer Blashki,
H.P.D.B. drivels :
The landscape that captivates me is in the symphony of
half-tints of a sky so delicate that it seems to be made of
evaporated azure. There are mists flaked with pink and
at the lilac line of the horizon white clouds forming an
aerial .exhedra. The. angels that are pitiful sit there, I
imagine. ...It is not even a picture. It is simply an
expression of the beautiful ephemeral as, the dust on' the.
wings of a butterfly. A breath would, efface it. . . . An’
artist must guard himself, belong to himself, remain
stable in the instability of things, realise himself obsti-
nately amid the diversity of phenomena.
And that is “fine writing” to the American
public and its wooden-nutmeg Ruskin !
&
It has now been discovered that Shakespeare
wrote the Psalms usually ascribed to King David.
Cut the final “e” from the poet’s name—no one
cared how it was spelt in the old days. Thus you
get 4 and 6—four vowels and six consonants.
Turn up the 46th Psalm, count 46 words from the
beginning, and you crane to the word “Shake.”
Count 46 words from the end, and you have
bpear. In the first line of the.second verse is
the word Will.” In the first line of the second
ver.-,e from the end is “Earn.” There you have
the whole, ‘ William Shakespear.” That is con-
clusive enough for anyone.

WOMEN AND
WARNER’S
SAFE CURE
The health of women is of supreme im-
portance. The daughter of to-day becomes
the wife of to-morrow, and it is abso-
lutely essential to the welfare of the race
that good health should be hers; good
health which brings happiness and en-
sures vigour in posterity. A woman’s
nervous system is very highly strung.
Her mechanism is far more delicate and
complex than that of a man, and there
is little to wonder at when it breaks down
under the continuous high pressure of
modern life.
Most women require some aid to enable
them to support the daily stress and
strain, and this aid is found in WARNER’S
SAFE CURE —a medicine wonderfully
adapted to their delicate organisation
which has for twenty years secured the
grateful endorsement of women in all
walks of life in all parts of the civilised
world.

“Charlton,” George Street,
Norwood, S.A.
October 1, 1900.
Dear Sirs, —
About seven years ago I contracted a severe
internal complaint, and was in a very critical
state. The doctor attending me told me that if I
lived I should be a sufferer all my lifetime. His
treatment was quite useless in giving me relief.
After two or three years I got tired of paying
doctors’ fees for no benefit, and hearingof Warner’s
Safe Cure I gave it a trial. I took, in all, five
bottles, and am thankful to state I am perfectly
cured. The medical man was genuinely surprised
at such a wonderful result. lam now as well as
it is possible to be, and give Warner’s Safe Cure
the whole credit for accomplishing what doctors
deemed impossible. Hoping that ladies, suffer-
ing as I did, will profit, I am writing to you now.
My mother considered that her life was saved by
the use of Warner’s Safe Cure in a somewhat
similar complaint. } ANNIE HARRIS.

Dear Sirs, —
I am pleased to report the benefit I derived
from the use of Warner’s Safe Cure. After many
years of pain and suffering from kidney and liver
complaint, I, who was accustomed to minister to
others, was brought to a bed of sickness myself.
The doctors could give me no hope of relief or
recovery, and said that I had but a short time to
live. I tried various advertised remedies, but all
failed to give me relief until I tried Warner’s Safe
Cure. From the first bottle I began to improve
in health. The pains gradually left me. I con-
tinued to take the medicine for some time, until I
was perfectly cured, and sound in body and mind.
I may state that the doctors were more than sur-
prised to see me up and about again. I have
heard of many other cases during my professional
career, which were in like manner cured by the use
of Warner’s Safe Cure.
Yours obediently,
EMMA DARVELL,
Ladies’ Nurse.

Gentlemen, —
I have great pleasure in testifying to the good
results I have obtained from the use of Warner’s
Safe Cure. For some time I was suffering great
agony with terrible pains in my side and around
my body. After trying several remedies, which
failed, I used Warner’s Safe Cure, and am happy
to state that I am now quite restored to health.
You may make this public and accept my thanks
for the good results I obtained.

Dear Sirs, —
I am pleased to be able to testify to the great
benefit I derived from the use of Warner’s Safe
Cure when suffering from insomnia and rheumatic
pains in my body and legs. I have only used a
few bottles, and the results have been simply
marvellous. Yours truly,

Dear Sirs, —
I owe my life principally to Warner’s Safe
Cure. I suffered for years in New Zealand from
bronchitis and lung complaint, and have been
in the District Hospital in Wellington three
different times. At last I was ordered to a warm
climate, but I still suffered much with pains in
my chest and back. One day I read a pamphlet,
and thought I would try Warner’s Safe Cure.
After I had taken the first bottle I found myself
stronger, and continued till I had used seven
bottles. I then came out to N.S.W., and am now
in perfect health. I earn my living by selling a
hair restorer of my own recipe and make, and am
walking about most of the day. lam well known
in the district, and I always recommend Warner’s
Safe Cure.
Yours thankfully,

For years I was a great sufferer from liver com-
plaint, which caused severe pains in my back and
sides and great mental depression. I was not able
to follow my calling. Hearing on reliable
authority of the beneficial effects of Warner’s
Safe Cure in kidney and liver complaints I gave
it a trial. From the first I derived great benefit,
and was ultimately completely cured. About
twelve years ago my husband used Warner’s Safe
Cure when suffering from weak and
neys. Two bottles restored him to health and
strength.
Yours truly, JANE DAY.

Some time ago I was suffering from severe
pains in my back and kidneys, and being tired of
medical treatment, which did me no good, I, on
the recommendation of a friend, tried Warner’s
Safe Cure. Three bottles and a half cured me,
and I have never been troubled since.
Yours obediently,

Dear Sirs, —
I have pleasure in giving evidence as to the
efficacy of Warner’s Safe Cure. For many years
I suffered from kidney and liver complaint. Fre-
quently I was quite prostrated and unable to do
my household work, my whole system being
affected, especially my head. The doctor who
treated me did me no good. I was advised to try
Warner’s Safe Cure and Warner’s Safe Pills.
After taking a few bottles of the medicine I felt
quite a different woman, and am now in the en-
joyment of as good health as I ever had in my
life.
Yours truly, (Mbs.) E. NELSON.

Sirs, —
I have found Warner’s Safe Cure to be a most
wonderful medicine for giving health and strength
when suffering trom that languid and tired feeling
which most women are subject to, and which
makes one unfit to attend to household duties,
or to any other business. In my case, Warner’s
Safe Cure had an immediate and lasting beneficial
effect. I strongly recommend Warner’s Safe Cure
to any ladies who may suffer in like manner, feel-
ing sure that they, too, will derive great benefit
from taking a course of this medicine.
Yours truly, (Mrs.) E. BADE.

Dear Sirs,—
Several years ago I was a continual sufferer
from kidney complaint. I was hardly ever free
from shivering attacks and severe pains in my
back and head. I was not able to go about my
duties, and was frequently confined to my bed.
Reading of some wonderful results brought about
by Warner’s Safe Cure, I gave it a trial. I felt
much benefit from the first bottle. After taking
half-a-dozen bottles, I was a new woman. I feel
quite sure that Warner’s Safe Cure saved my life.
Yours truly, (Mrs.) ELLEN RELF.

The secret of the remarkable effects of Warner’s Safe Cure is that it causes the liver and kidneys to become perfectly healthy.
When these vital organs are doing their work thoroughly, all poisonous acids and other waste products of the body are removed
naturally, and such diseases as Indigestion, Biliousness, Sick Rheumatism, Gout, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Backache,
Sciatica, Anaemia, General Debility, Blood Disorders, Gravel and Bladder Troubles can no longer exist, as they are all caused by
the presence in the blood of these impurities.

A CASE IN PYRMONT.
A Permanent Recuperation.
The Case of Mr. W. H. ATKINS.
(by our reporter.)
What an easy matter it is for a benevo-
lent being to diffuse pleasure and gladness
around him. In order to do so it is only
necessary to consider what means are pos-
sessed to lighten the burdens of our fellow-
men, and to help in whatever direction the
conscience may dictate. It is evident that
Mr. William Henry Atkins, of No. 211
Crown-road, Pyrmont, shares in this
opinion, for he said in reply to a question
put by our reporter :
“Of course, I will give you any informa-
tion you require, as the knowledge I gained
may be turned to good account by some
poor sufferer in need of good advice. It
has always been my motto to help those in
distress, and I think I can do so by letting
humanity know about the remarkable ex-
perience I had. I think that worry was at
the back of all my troubles, for after an in-
cident which grieved me greatly, I fell into
bad health. I did not care about anything
to eat, simply because I had no appetite.
The most tasty morsels imaginable failed to
tempt me as a rule, although I had to force
myself to take some nourishment when I
felt that I could not hold out any longer.
Not only was my appetite bad, but I ab-
stained from eating because of the pains
which afterwards appeared. My stomach
always got full of wind, which shifted about
from side to side, and left cramping pains
in all directions, and heavy pains affected
my chest. Sometimes I felt as if the
breath was being crushed out of me, the
oppression was so great, and I naturally felt
deeply concerned about it, as chest com-
plaints are so serious in their consequences.
As my food was not doing me any good I
lost strength rapidly, and soon I dropped
into that languid state of indifference to
everything which is so disastrous to every
businessman’s career. I felt as if I did'
not care how things went, and the morbid-
ness of my spirits quite precluded me from
thinking about anything pleasant. Haras-
sed as I was by depressing headaches, and
with my eyes dim and feeling as if they
were swollen, no wonder that I lost all in-
terest in life, for the average man does not
wish to live unless he is contented and at
ease.”
“But your lot was not so hard to bear
when night came, for then, I suppose, you
obtained relief in sleep ? ” remarked Mr.
Atkins’ interrogator.
“ Don’t you believe it; if anything, my I
nights were more intolerable than the days,
as I could not succeed in getting anything.
like a night’s rest. Certainly, I used to \
doze off from time to time, but the sleep
was not refreshing, because of the intrusion
of repulsive dreams, and when I got up I
felt as weary as if I had 1 een awake all
night. I could hardly stand the bitter taste
which was in my mouth every morning, and
the unhealthy condition of my stomach
could be detected by the fur on my tongue;
but what I regretted more than all else was
the quick and painful throbbing of my heart.
When I laid down I felt that organ shaking
inside in a way that caused me much alarm,
so that, with every particle of strength
being gradually eaten away by my com-
plaints, there was nothing in my condition
to assist me in entertaining hopes of a re-
covery. The least exertion brought on a
feeling of faintness, and when 1 stood up I
used to get quite giddy, as if everything
was on the move. All this I put down to
my extreme weakness, which was also re-
sponsible for the annoying aches in my legs
and loins.' From some cause or other my
arms were also intensely painful, and if ever
a nervous system was wrecked it was mine
On the least provocation I became excited
and irritable, while the trembling of my
nerves served to increase the general misery
of my existence. My body was greatly de
nuded of flesh, and I can tell you in all
seriousness that my life was a burden which
I would willingly have east off at any
moment.”
“I believe you suffered in this way
several years,” interjected the scribe.
“ During the period of your illness did yon
ever enlist the services of a medical man ? ”
“ Considering that I was lingering, wait
ing, and hoping for years, I should rather
think I did,” replied Mr. Atkins. “ Why,
I consulted dozens of doctors, yet my suffer-
ings grew worse, and I may also state that
I have taken scores of medicines which were
procured at stores and chemists’ shops. It
would have been far better if I had kept
the money in my pocket, for all but one of the
medicines were of no service to me. The
only remedy which suited my complaints
was Clements Tonic, and this was recom-
mended to me by a man living in Harris-
street, who had used it, and knew what it
could do. After taking two bottles of
Clements Tonic I felt much better, and was
able to get about with much more freedom.
I went to a chemist to get some more, but
he put me off by saying he coidd give me
something better, and pointed out the
difference in the size of the bottles, so,
foolishly enough, I bought his medicine in-
stead of Clements Tonic, and in a few days
I was as bad as ever. Then I insisted on
having Clements Tonic, and again I im-
proved under its influence, so that there was
no doubt about its being the best medicine
in the market. I would rather have one
dose of Clements Tonic than a barrelful of
any other medicine, for it proved its supe-
riority in every possible way. The first
thing it did was to make me eat and sleep,
and I was glad of the respite from my
afflictions which I had when resting. Be-
fore long a feeling of animation spread right
through my system, and I then shook oil
the yoke of depression which had clouded
my past few years, as I felt assured that
Clements Tonic would pull me through. In
course of time the pains arising from indi-
gestion were quelled; the nauseous taste
left my mouth, and my head was free from
aches. Some of my doctors said my liver
was diseased, while others said my stomach
was extremely weak; but if they had seen
me after a few weeks’ use of Clements
Tonic they would not have known me. My
stomach could then digest and retain any
kind of food, and my liver symptoms were
non-existent. The shaking of my nerves
was promptly checked by Clements Tonic,
and the regulating and strengthening effects
of that medicine on my system generally
were really extraordinary. Every ache and
pain yielded to the pacifying influences of
Clements Tonic, and I am heartily thank-
ful to say that by its exclusive use my
health was re-established. I have lived in
this house for the past 17 years, and all the
neighbours know that Clements Tonic cured
me ; but for the benefit of those who are
unaware of these facts you may publish
them in any form you like.”

Sickly Children
‘Her own dear little self again,
thanks entirely to Scott s
Emulsion”
In these trying winter weeks one hears
everywhere the cry of the children, disease
so easily breaks down their tender strength.
Every mother should answer that cry in
this way. w e stberry Avenue,
* “ Green Lanes, London, England,
“ April 22nd, 1901.
it Dear Sirs,— My little daughter, two
years of age, had a very bad attack of
whooping cough last autumn I tried
everything I could, for her, but could not
got her well, and she fell away to almost
nothing. Reading of many who had bene-
fited by Scott’s Emulsion, I decided to
try the preparation for my child, and
lam very thankful I did so. In a few
weeks, after taking Scott’s Emulsion, there
was a very material improvement in her
condition, and the cough was not nearly
so harsh or distressing. What rather sur-
prised me was the quickness with which she
PHYLIS AUDRY WILLS.
(From a photograph.)
acquired a taste for Scott’s Emulsion; she
really wanted more than was good for her.
I soon felt we were on the right track.
You may be interested to know my wife
procured a bottle of emulsion from a
chemist, stated to be ‘ theirj own make, but
it did not have the least effect upon baby,
and after that we would have nothing but
‘Scott’s.’ Now when I look at my child
and remember what she was a few months
ago, I can scarcely believe she is the same
little one. She is thoroughly well, strong,
and healthy, and her own dear little self
again, thanks entirely to Scott’s Emulsion.
“ Yours very sincerely,
“ (Signed) Edward Wills.”
Whooping cough is, of course, only one of
the many children's illnesses flying about
just now. Measles, mumps, bronchitis,
rickets, marasmus, poor digestion, anaemia,
scarlet fever, these are some of the un-
pleasant words one hears in all directions.
In every case of these diseases Scott’s Emul-
sion should at one stage or another be
given—Scott’s Emulsion will cure. There
is nothing to be obtained anywhere that is
half so good for sickly children. Your own
doctor will agree to this.
And your own sense will agree that you
cannot hope for the striking results pro-
duced by Scott’s Emulsion if you buy
something else. You may be offered what
is said to be “ just as good,” but the seller
of such imitation or substitute has no
evidence of what he says, and can produce
none, for the simple reason that Scott's
Emulsion is the standard children’s remedy
on which all others are modelled. Mr.
Wills’s experience with one of these “just
as good” preparations shows you exactly
what to expect from them. No imitation
is ever as good as the original.
Mr. Wills emphasises another striking
point about Scott’s Emulsion—how nice it
is to take: “she really wanted more than
was good for her.” This is the great ad-
vantage Scott’s Emulsion has over common
cod-liver oil, which no one ever wants to
take! And then, medicinally, Scott’s Emul-
sion is, according to the comparative tests
of a distinguished physician, “ three times
as efficacious as the same amount of
common cod-liver oil.”
For these reasons see that the picture cf
a man carrying a big fish is on the wrapper
of every bottle; if they are there you have
Scott’s Emulsion.
You can obtain a sample of Scott’s Emulsion
by sending fourpence to Scott & Bowne, Ltd.,
483 Kent-street, Sydney, and mentioning this
paper. All chemists sell Scott’s Emulsion.

A Millionaire.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When I walk into town,
Having no tramway-fare,
My heart is not cast down,
I do not fret or frown,—
I am a Millionaire.
The way, indeed, is long,
And longer still might seem,
But, midst the moving throng,
I hear a golden song,
And dream a golden dream.
The dream is brave and bold :
A noble legacy—
Ten thousand pounds in gold—
Left by an uncle old,
Has found its way to me.
I am a Friend of Art,
And haunt the studios;
I play the Patron’s part
In princely style: my heart
It opens like a rose.
There is no painter poor,
Whose works I do not buy,
And make his fame secure,
And board and lodging sure—
With beer when he is dry.
The Poets, most of all,
Are patronised by me.
I build for them a tall,
Fine oimmunistic hall—
A grand phalanstery.
A garden, large and fair,
That stately home surrounds;
And scent of blossoms rare
Perfumes the pleasant air
Within those pleasant grounds.
And glasses gaily clink,
Each filled with liquor prime,
Whose bubbles brightly wink ;
And he who wants a drink
Need only write a rhyme.
In my phalanstery
The bards find noble cheer,
And live like lords, rent-free,
And merely pay to me
A poem once a year.
I look around and sigh;
The trams rush up and down.
How money seems to fly !
My fortune’s spent, and I
Am still a mile from town.
I should have made my cake
Much bigger at the start;
It is the great mistake
That most day-dreamers make—
To play the miser’s part.
But what means that to me ?
Merely a moment’s thought.
And with a smile of glee,
Unto my legacy
I simply add a nought.
Then watch me sweeping by
With golden-crowned Romance !
My head it strikes the sky;
I am King Midas —I
And Lord of High Finance.
Bohemian friends of mine,
The men I knew of old,
I ask them all to dine,
And fill them up with wine,
And cram their hats with gold.
I give a dinner great
To creditors done-brown,
And place beneath each plate
A cheque for debts to date
I wake, and am in town !

CREEVE ROE.
Fishing Lines.
Many there be whose balladry be-rhymes
The Race from fallen flag to whacking whips,
And many they that ring Sb. Cupid’s chimes,
For that love turns to lutes and lyres their lips ;
And some they sing of Stock, and some of Ships,
And some the swirling of the miner’s dish,
But strike we here the string for him that trips
Forth with the patient push whose single wish
It is to fish and fish, and then again to fish.
These be the folk love well the River G-od,
His ruffled ripple and his rattling reed,
And eke his wealth of bream and weight of cod
Beyond where waits the woven water-weed,
To snag the hook, therefrom not easy freed ;
These love the river-wind (so oft has spoke
To singers stretched where banks be shadow-
treed) ; .
They love to hear it yarning to the oak
What time the hours serene serener make a
smoke.
Ay, seems it for this sort is joy enow
Where, on his wallaby, their River God
Smiles to the rushes which, replying, bow
And greets the grasses that responsive nod :
Here on a forky stick they fix the rod
To learn that the expected ne’er may come,
At least till twilight brings with it that odd
Jeer of the Jackass from the patriarch gum,
Blest hour of bites! for now mosquitos ’gin to hum.
But, sure, to us beyond all bends and birds
Our craft’s own notes: —the sinker as it drops—
Yea, e’en the dreadful din of Jack’s wild words
Finding once more he hath forgot the chops,
Or tangleth tight his tackle in tree-tops,
Or when our last match dies and disappears,
Or on the strand the hated cat-fish flops,
Or, as when prey more prized the margin nears,
The traitorous hook betrays and straight the great
cod clears.
O, sweet the shadows when the dark, deep drifts
At the strange stillness of the sunset dream,
Sweet when the amorous moon flings lavish gifts
Of gold and silver to her love, the stream;
Yet, sweetest of riparian hours, I deem
That one wherein the tell-tale float makes tracks,
And strained the lines that long so loose did seem,
And mine a big’un hauls to land, but Jack’s
—The spoil a foot from shore—all on a sudden
slacks!

SATURDAY, MAY 17, 1902.
The Real Reform Movement and the
Bogus One.
The cry for reform of the State Parliaments,
and the State finances, and the State politics
generally, grows louder in the land, and
N.S. Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania have all
got the disease. South Australia is peaceful.
It has had its reform, in a sense ; that is to
say, it lias cut down its Parliament a little,
and left things at that, with all the really
large evils untouched. The reform move-
ment is almost wholly a financial movement,
and the reduction of Parliament is advocated
mainly on the ground that it will save a cer-
tain small amount of money—in N.S. W.
per inhabitant per annum. Therefore the
reduction is, in every case, aimed principally
at the Lower House, which has some brains
and a very moderate salary. The Upper
House, which has less brains, and is utterly
stagnant, and, in the three leading States
at all events, receives no salary, arouses no
serious hostility. The financial discussion has
enabled a large number of alleged reformers,
among whom the Melbourne Age is pro-
minent, to exhibit a pitiable ignorance as to
the real condition of affairs, the usual pro-
cess of argument being to ask wildly and
generally why it should require, say, £7 per
inhabitant ''annually to run this country
when £3 per inhabitant is sufficient in
the United Kingdom? The difference
arises mainly through railway fares and
freights being called public revenue in Aus-
tralia and not in England, and through cost
of working the railways, interest on money
spent on their construction, cost of police,
education, and charities being called public
expenditure in Australia, while in England
the first two are not at all, and the other
three only in part, so described. This is sim-
ple enough, but it is apparently outside the
knowledge of most of the agitators. The
general tendency is to rush wildly at that £7
or so, and cut off the tail of it with an axe
regardless of circumstances.
* * • •
The first essential of financial reform is to
get a distinct idea what are the finances
which it is proposed to reform. To make a
beginning of this, the railway accounts
should be taken out of the national balance-
sheet altogether. The railways should be
•debited with their working expenses and the
interest upon the loan money owing on their
account, and credited with their own
revenue; and when the balance is struck
•only the amount, if any, which the general
revenue has to contribute to makegood their
shortage should appear in the general
balance-sheet. Then Victoria would realise
that its real expenditure, including educa-
tion, old age pensions and the railway deficit,
is now only about £4,000,000 a year, and
N.S.W.’s would stand at about £7,000,000,
and a great deal of the sensational and bogus
element would vanish out of the public
finances. This would help to abolish the
crowd of excited but useless persons whose
one idea is to fix a bloodshot and unreason-
ing eye upon the big totals in the public
accounts, and then rush at them with a
lethal weapon. And having got rid of these
persons there might be a chance of real
reform.
» * * *
The public works expenditure should also
constitute a separate account. The present
system puts a premium on fraud and dis-
honesty, and makes lying a profitable under-
taking. The public only looks at totals, and
anyone who can fake the total can please the
public—when such financial authorities as
the Age and George D. Meudell know no
better the general public can’t be expected
to know any better either. The Treasurer
who spends out of revenue £6,000,000 on
the ordinary business of government, and
£2,000,000 on necessary public works, is a
spendthrift who “ ble’ws ” £8,000,000 of
public income in one year. His successor,
who charges all these works to loans, and
yet spends £1,000,000 more than the other
man on the ordinary business of government,
stands forth brilliantly as the economist who
runs the country on £7,000,000. The na-
tural result is that the economist, or fakir,
or public fraud and swindle, who keeps
down the ordinary expenditure by charging
all manner of things to loans, is exceedingly
common. _ Except in rare instances, is
the only kind of politician that it pays to be.
He gets the approbation of the Age, and, in
a less degree, of George D. Meudell, and
of all the other people who look at the totals
and then yell; and that reward keeps him
up.
• • » *
Further, it is highly advisable that the
Public Works Fund should not only be kept
separate from the general accounts, like the
railway funds, but that the proceeds of cer-
tain taxes and other revenues should be paid
directly into that fund, without going
through the ordinary revenue at all, and
should be so strictly set apart for Public
Works purposes that they can be diverted
under no circumstances whatever. The
reform parties in N.S.W., Victoria, and
Tasmania all demand that borrowing for un-
productive works shall cease ; and not only
this but all borrowing should cease—it
can’t cease too soon. There has already, in
various States and in times of great stress,
been a temporary or partial cessation of bor-
rowing for non-revenue-yielding works, but
always with the same unsatisfactory result.
The necessary works that used to be pro-
vided for out of loans were not provided for
out of revenue—they were stopped altoge-
ther. Ministers were afraid to pay for
them out of revenue, for under a system
where money spent on making new roads
and docks, afid money spent on a Coronation
Drunk, are all lumped together, they would
simply have been remembered as the per-
sons who made a lamentable increase of
expenditure, and the Age and George
D. Meudell would have denounced them
accordingly. So when there was unusual
economy in the way of charging public works
to loans it simply meant that new schools
were not built where they were wanted, that
buildings were allowed to fall into disrepair,
that valuable works were left half-finished,
and so on. And when the country got tired
of this state of things, the loan leprosy
returned. There is no permanent reform to
be made in this way.
• » • *
Experience has shown that New South
Wales can get through with £9,400,000 of
revenue and £600,000 of loan moneys im-
properly applied to revenue purposes—total,
£10,000,000. It has also shown that
N.S.W. can spend nearly £11,000,000 of
revenue and steal over £1,000,000 of loan
money for revenue purposes—total, over
£l2,ooo,ooo—without very much more to
show for it* And in a less degree the same
thing has happened in other States. If
N.S.W. enacted that borrowing should cease
and that the whole land revenue, of nearly
£2,000,000 a year, should be paid into a pub-
lic works fund to take the place of loans, it
would possibly be found that the State could
get through on the revenue that was left to
it. If nothing of the kind is enacted, then
the expenditure, without any special provision
for public works, will continue to swell up
and consume the income as usual. It is no
use trusting to the surplus to pay for unpro-
ductive but necessary works—there never is
any surplus, and there is never likely to be
under the present easy-going conditions. So
long as the Governor’s salary, and the interest
on the public debt, and the civil service
wage-sheet, and the grants to country schools-
of-arts and hog shows, and all the sundries and
miscellaneous expenditure have first, call on
the revenue, and the public works vote gets
only what is left, the public works vote will
mostly depend on loans, and all the pro-
grammes of all the reform leagues that ever
were or will be, will make no difference.
But if loans are prohibited by Act of Parlia-
ment, and the land revenue in N.S.NV.
(equal to about £2,000,000 a year)
and the land revenue and land and
income-tax receipts in Victoria (equal
to about £700,000 a year) are paid
into a separate fund to supply their place,
and the trust funds are put in the hands of
trustees, absolutely beyond the Treasurer’s
reach, then the Government will have to
make the remainder of the revenue cover the
ordinary costs of administration, or else find
more revenue. In New South Wales, it
might be possible to fill the gap by economy.
In Victoria and Tasmania, which are already
run more economically than even England is,
it would almost certainly be necessary to tax
David Syme and George D. Meudell some-
thing extra to make the accounts balance.
♦ • * #
There is no way, apart from this cast-iron
process of law, by which the necessary reform
is likely to be effected. If there is merely a
vague, general instruction to economise, a
Treasurer may abstain from borrowing for
unproductive works for a year, or possibly
two, or perhaps only six months. Then the
popular impulse will have died away, like
the stamp-collecting disease, or the habit of
having surprise-parties, or the ping-pong
mania, or the Simultaneous Mission, and
the man who promises to restore the
endowments to schools of arts and the grants
to cattle shows, and to make up for the extra
outlay by “ borrowing in moderation in
order to judiciously develop the re-
sources of the country,” will outbid the
economical Treasurer and get his office.
It would be difficult, at least it would be
a matter of unpleasant publicity, to secure
the repeal of the anti-borrowing law
and the law assigning certain revenues
for public works purposes ; but in the
absence of such laws then the conscientious
Treasurer who broke his heart trying to put
things right would get neither gratitude nor
reward. After a few months his attempts at
economy and his demands for more revenue
would be met on all sides by the suggestion
that a little temporary raising of money
would do no harm, and wouldn’t be noticed.
He would lose the support of the country
member whose hog-show had been docked
of its subsidy. He would be denounced by
the Age for increasing David Syme’s taxes.
He would be called a cheese-parer and a
skinflint and a man devoid of broad ideas.
The “ broad-minded person ” who believed in
a policy of “ developing the resources of the
country by a judicious expenditure of bor-
rowed money ” would breathe in the ear of
his party and win it away. And he would
go out of office a poor, worn-out man, and
the papers would ever after speak of him in
the highest terms—but he would remain out
of office all the same.
• • • *
Take Premier Peacock as a case in point,
a rather weak man of good intentions, yet
of considerable intelligence. It is absurd to
hope that Peacock, by himself, would,
especially for his paltry salary, keep up a
long-continued struggle for the repair of
things financial. The Age and G. D. Meu-
dell and the Kyabram League would pre-
sently give up supporting him actively and
go about their other business. The House
would support most cordially every abstract
proposition re the saving of money, but
every member whose job or steal or per-
quisite was cut off in the effort at reducing
the proposition to practice, and every man
whose interests were touched by the new
tax proposals, would be a lost vote, so long
as there was a Tory leader with a fine, large
lavish policy to give the vote to. But if
loans were legally prohibited, and trust-
funds couldn’t be got at, and the £700,000 a
year of land revenue and land and income-tax
money had to be paid, by the operation of
a boiler-plated statute, into the Public
Works Fund, then even a Premier of infirm
purpose ivould be master of the situation.
He could inform the country member that
he might or might not consent that his
school of arts, or agricultural show subsidy
be retrenched, but there wasn’t the least
hope of there being any money to pay it
with, even supposing it was nominally voted.
He could resist the importunate member
who wanted his relative appointed to the
public service by the simple intimation that
the relative could come in if he liked, but
there was no money to pay him with. If
new taxation became really necessary it
would be forthcoming when the alternative
lay in stopping payment. And he could
fight this battle without losing votes, for the
sufficient reason that not even a Duncan
Gillies, or an O’Sullivan, with the same
laws to restrict him, could offer any better
terms.
• • • «
If the Reform Party, while its enthusiasm
is still at white heat, can force the State
Parliaments to pass the two statutes here
suggested—an anti-borrowing law and a law
setting aside sufficient sources of revenue
(say £2,000,000 a year in N.S.W., and
£700,000 in Victoria) for the supply of a
Public Works Fund—then the other
reforms and economies will take care of
themselves. But if it expects a Treasurer,
for the sake of the miserable pittance
which is called a Ministerial salary, to adhere
persistently by his own efforts to a policy
which the country itself will have practically
forgotten in six months—to be abused for
his parsimony as the Age abused Turner in
the latter days of his Victorian premiership,
and as the Argus and Paunch abused him
almost all the time—to sacrifice his political
career by offending with his integrity
members whom his opponent is willing to
placate with loan funds and extravagances—
then it expects too much. The popular
Reform Movement is as ephemeral as a
religious revival. The only way to give it
some reasonable show of permanence is
to fix its policy by Act of Parliament, so
that the old easy-going ways of sin can’t be
slid into again without the formal and public
repeal of that Act.
The Tory Sydney University.
Sydney University Senate, Thb Bulletin hears
on good authority, has been seriously considering
question of ‘Mealing with ” Mr. G. A. Wood,
Chains Professorof History, fordaring tohold views
different from those of Dr. Maclaurin and Dr.
Ken wick on the question of the Boer war, and
approximating his opinion to that of the late Mr.
Gladstone ; also for daring to address a Labor
party meeting on the subject. From what one
hears, this Senate has been more scandalised by
Prof. Wood dragging the culture of the Univer-
sity down to the depths of a Trades and Labor
Council than even by his daring to share the
opinions of Herbert Spencer, John Ruskin,
Bryce, George Meredith, Froude, Glad-
stone, Hori Grey, and a few other people of low
opinions, but of well-cut coats, as to the situation
in South Africa. The Trades and Labor Council
delegate usually combines low democratic views
with unfashionable clothing, and that union is
irremediably hateful to the fatted Tories of
the university Senate. This intention of the
Senate to either gag or bludgeon Professor Wood
has been freely canvassed by the Labor party
during the last few days. The issue was brought
before them as affecting, not the rights or wrongs
of the Boer war—that is an issue on which the
Party has agreed to differ—but the right of
freedom of speech in a democratic community.
Subsequently the outside organisation of the
political Labor Party discussed the matter and
came, we understand, to an almost unanimous
agreement that any such outrage on civil liberty
as the University Senate contemplated would
have to be combatted from the first, and, if carried
into effect, made the subject of as effective a
remonstrance as possible.
• * * •
With that decision every democrat must agree,
whatever his views on the South African war. If,
for exercising his rights as a free citizen, a servant
of the University is to be victimised through the
ignorant, illiberal tyranny of that institution’s
governors, the conclusion must be come to that the
University is a danger to the democracy of this
state, and must be treated as such in the future.
There already exists good cause for resentment
against the. Tory tendencies of Sydney Univer-
sity. It is in the position of having received from
the State a magnificent tract of land, frequent
subventions for its building funds, and an annual
subsidy now standing at £14,700. Without the
help it received from the general taxpayer it could
never have come into existence, and could now not
continue in existence. Yet it has always shaped
its policy so as to make its classes as close a pre-
serve as possible for the sons of the rich, and to bar
from them the sons of the poor (who yet have to
dive deeply into their pockets to help pay for its
up-keep). It further seeks to confine its scope so
as to be as much as possible a merely Sydney
institution. In the election of its Senate, for
Distance, practically only Sydney members of
Convocation can vote, as the franchise rnay only
be exercised in Sydney, and graduates living in
the country cannot, as a rule, afford a lengthy jour-
ney to the capital to participate in a senatorial
election. The duty of an institution which is
in large part maintained by the general tax-
payer—with money drawn from Bathurst, Bourke,
Goulburn, and Newcastle, as well as Sydney—to
give country students some share in its benefits by
extension lectures, is almost entirely neglected.
It is a weighty impeachment, therefore, which can
already be urged against this institution. If, in
addition, its governing body assumes the functions
of a Censor of opinions, and seeks to crush out all
expression of Democratic thought on the part of
University professors, it will become a necessary
duty of Liberals to take means to crush it utterly,
if necessary ; otherwise, to reform it root and
branch.
* •** • •
The power at the disposal of Parliament, if ever
exercised to the full, would be undoubtedly effi-
cacious. What free grants of money have been
made to the University of Sydney in the past
cannot, of course, be revoked. But the land on
which the University buildings stand was not
actually given to the institution, but conferred on
a “peppercorn rental”—that is to say the State
can demand yearly one peppercorn as rent: and
it can raise that rent to two peppercorns, or to
£20,000, as representing the full rental value of
the property, if it pleases. That would be an
extreme step, but quite a feasible one. A yet
more simple means of dealing with Toryism in its
Gothic entrenchments at Newtown would be the
withdrawal of its subsidies. For 1901-2 the Uni-
versity is estimated to get from the State of
N.S.W. :
By statutory endowments ... .. £5,500
By votes on the Estimates .. .. 9’200
Total £14,700
A mere vote on the Estimates could lop off the
£92oo—an Act of Parliament the £5500. The
withdrawal even of £9200 would probably make
the carrying on of the University impossible; if
in addition the statutory grant were annulled, and
a heavy ground rent were imposed, Dr. Maclaurin
and Co. would certainly have to close down ; they
would not be likely to seek to make up the deficit
out of their own pockets. And if the University
is to show itself an ignorantly Tory institution,
devoted to the suppression rather than the culture
of thought, Liberals in Parliament will certainly
work to that end, and work with the full approval
of the constituencies. We can better afford to do
without a higher knowledge of Latin than without
the democratic right of Freedom of Speech.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Peacock’s Tale.
Much will be forgiven and many things will be
forgotten in the case of Victoria’s Premier
Peacock if he only adheres to the constitutional
reform ideas which he has outlined. His pro-


gramme is not quite an ideal one, but it
than was commonly expected, it is
ahead of the Tory and fraudulent
policy,” and it is a larger measure of re ' or ffi , tl f
most countries get in one instalment without
revolution. The principal suggestions are .
m Assembly to be reduced from 95 members to 60
returned by *6O constituencies and elected by adu t
BU (2) a House of 48 Rich Landlords to have its membership
reduced to 30, returned by 15 constituencies. .
/o\ aii ratepayers to have votes for the House of Land-
loSs, which the number of voters from
133 |?a£ Severson who has a vote for the House of
Landlords to be elioible to be a member of that boot.
(5) In case of deadlock, both Houses to be dissolvable
Incase of further deadlock the matter at issue to be
settled by a vote of the two Houses sitting as one.
(6) Ministers to be allowed to speak in either House.
The great reform lies in clause 4. Hitherto, by
reason of the property qualification, only 2000
persons in all Victoria were capable of being
elected to the House of Landlords, and when
from this number were deducted those who were
too old, too busy, too vacant in their minds, who
were absent, who didn’t care for politics, and
those who were in the Assembly, it was seldom
possible to get two candidates together. Ihe 48
Rich Landlords were allowed to insolently dis-
qualify 131,000 out of their 133,000 electors, and to
treat them as political lepers and outcasts, unfit to
sit in the House which they were supposed to create,
and which was supposed to represent them. Bra-
inier Peacock’s reform policy, if it is earned out,
will lift Victoria, in a constitutional sense, from
its antiquated position on the extreme back seats
of civilisation to a front place. If it is carried out
—that is the question ! All the Kyabram crowd
of boodlers and frauds and Tories will howl
bitterly about their magnificent scheme of saving
2id. per inhabitant annually (a whole complete
2VI ) bycutting down the membership of the Demo-
cratic branch of the Legislature, being mixed up
with a small matter like decent and progressive
government, and thereby put to hazard. Llie
Assembly isn’t likely to give a large majority to
a measure for sacking 35 of its members. Ihe
House of Landlords will almost certainly cut out
the reform clauses, and offer to pass the measure
as a reduction measure alone. All the Kyabram
push, and the G. D. Meudell crowd, and the
Argus will urge the Government not to sacrifice
the chance of saving 21yd. per inhabitant annually
by its blind obstinacy in attempting to furnish
Victoria with a decent Legislature. Peacock came
back from the last election pledged to call together a
popularly elected Convention to draft a new Con-
stitution. He had the people with him, and he
had a small majority in the Assembly, and yet he
weakened miserably and let the thing drop. Now
the question is: Has Peacock got more courage
and more fighting capacity than he had a year or
two ago ? Everything depends on that. A man
who can’t fight is of no use in the present
emergency. If Peacock sees this matter through
to the bitter end The Bulletin will never call
him Pecksniff again.
A White Man’s Exclusion Act.
The Commonwealth law, which was framed for
the exclusion of the Asiatic, is apparently being
administered by the Barton Government as a
law for keeping out white men and letting in
every possible nigger who applies. The unfor-
tunate circumstance about the Aliens Exclusion
law is that its efficiency depends wholly on the
common sense and good faith of its administrators.
In this matter, as in many others, Australia came
to grief over the British connection. The irres-
ponsible despot at the other end—the man whom
Australia has no voice in electing to his Parlia-
mentary position, and who stands towards us in
the same position as a Turkish sultan or other
violent character —insisted that there should be
no direct exclusion, only an educational test. The
applicant at our front door may, or may not,
as the Federal Government feels inc’ined, be re-
quired to write out 50 words in any European
language, and be shut out if he fails to do so.
It rests with the Government to decide: (1)
to whom the test shall be applied and to whom it
shall not; (2) what language shall be used ; (3)
what degree of accuracy in writing out the 50
words shall constitute passing the test. The
Act may be made to exclude every, nigger,
and to let in every white man, or to ex-
clude everybody or to admit everybody—in
fact, Joseph Chamberlain’s foolishness gives the
Federal Government almost unlimited power in
this respect. And the use to which the Barton
Ministry has put that power so far has been a
shameful treachery to the White Australia ideal
and a disreputable crawling to the nigger-loving
Salisbury-Chamberlain Government. Every
Hindu who pounds at our gate is tested in the
nearest approach to his own language that the
law will admit of. These attractive brothers
and friends and descendants of the butchers
of Cawnpore are required to write out a
simple passage in English, practically the
only European language current m India, and
are thus given every possible opportunity to get
through. But the other day at Newcastle (N.S. W.)
the law fell savagely on a Portuguese sailor who
had deserted his ship, and who knew no more of
the Aliens Restriction Law than he did of
Andree’s lost balloon. If it had given him the
same chance that it so anxiously gives to the nigger,
and tested him in the European language with
which he was sure to be most familiar —Portuguese
—he might have passed, but, according to the
newspaper report, it tested him in English, and
then fell on him with a savage sentence of six
months’ gaol for not being able to write the tongue
of Shakespeare. A Portuguese, even a Portu-
guese common sailor, is not an undesirable
immigrant in the same sense that an Asiatic,
whether prince or coolie, is. He is a white man,
with the white man’s possibilities, and can inter-
marry with us without causing any deterioration
of the race. The law does not require that he
should be put to the test at all—it is optional, not
compulsory. It does not specify that the test
shall be in English—that was a disreputable
stretching of the law to oppress the white stranger,
while the way of the undesirable nigger is smoothed
in every possible manner. When two niggers re-
cently broke away from a ship in a Queensland port
they were simply brought back and put on board
again— they didn’t get six months as the white
man does, for being illegally at large in the Com-
monwealth. The Sydney Telegraph struck a
great truth when it suggested that it would be a
fair thing if the Portuguese Government cap-
tured Premier Barton in its territory, and gave
him six months in gaol for not knowing the Por-
tuguese language, and for being unable to write
out a passage from Camoens to dictation. There
is an urgent necessity for the Labor party in the
Federal Parliament to make it clear to the Barton
Ministry that the Act is not to be applied to. the
white stranger within our gates, that no civilised
country sends a white man to gaol for not know-
ing foreign languages, and that the law is an anti-
nigger law, and is to be used as such.
The Usualness of being 1 a Murderer.
An old Bulletin contributor, who se honesty and
truth this paper can voucii lor to as great an
extent as it would care to back the moral P.JN.
of any man, and who was 13 months at the
S’African war as a non-commissioned officer, tells
this:
Every soldier who has been much in the field and has
talked much with Tommies and fellow colonials has heard
dozens of stories of atrocities as bad as those related of
the Bushveldters —or nearly so. I do not think I am far
wrong in saying that Boers are murdered every week.
There are columns, such as the Canadian Scouts, in which
it is understood right through that prisoners are not to
be taken, but are to be shot right off. The commanding
officer does not line his men up and say, “ I, , hereby
give orders,” etc. But there are other ways of achieving
the same result. The Canadians are far the worst in this
respect, and they will tell you with much satisfaction of
scalpings and “ necktie-parties.”
I never saw any of these atrocities committed. But
out there you can get plenty of first-hand evidence. It
is told to you always, as the story of a meritorious deed,
to one who should, as a matter of course, appreciate it.
The idea that the killing of a surrendered Boer will not
be regarded as a great deed never seems to be thought of
out there. I have a vivid recollection of the look of
astonishment and disgust on the face of a Tommy when I
described, as a set of savages, the participants in a parti-
cularly revolting piece of Boer-killing which he had
narrated. He told me how a soldier had found an
unwounded Boer hiding down an ant-bear hole, and,
instead of making him come out as a prisoner, bayonetted
him by degrees down the hole, which he then filled up.
These yarns are often told with such corroborative
detail that, even bearing in mind the great anxiety
of Tommy to tell something particularly atrocious,
go as to earn the approbation of colonial
listeners, it is impossible not to believe them.
A Maorilander once described to me the catching and
shooting of a sniper on the Barberton trip towards the
end of 1900. ‘‘Where was the officer?” “Oh, the
officer partly suggested it, and got away out of sight.
The sniper begged for his life.” “ What did they kill him
for ?” “ Why, because he was a sniper, and had been
annoying them for a long time before he was caught.”
A sniper (one man fighting on his own) is by some per-
version of ideas supposed to be breaking the rules of war
—if he is a Boer, that is.
The hanging by the Canadians in American fashion
(that is with revolver accompaniment) of four Boer sur-
renderors because of an alleged white flag incident some
time before, I have seen indignantly denied by a Canadian
colonel in Engiand. If that colonel did not know it was
quite true, he ought to have known, because nine
Canadians out of ten can give him all information about
the story.
I have come back with some well-defined ideas.
First that the Boer is on the average a much
more humane and chivalrous man than the average
Tommy (who mostly approximates to the city
larrikin); or than the average colonial, who is a
man of much more excited and excitable passions
than the Boer ; or than the average Canadian,
who is simply a white Red Indian, and should be
absolutely prohibited from taking part in civilised
warfare. It is also my painful fate to believe,
since I know it for a positive fact and cannot get out of it,
that there are more “ white flag incidents,” more
atrocities and barbarities, and less chivalry on the English
than on the Boer side. Also that warfare, so far from
developing the nobler and more chivalrous passions, does
just the opposite. I am sorry. I would have had my old
faiths remain. But I can never look at my fellow man
now, even if he be merely engaged in the ferocious occu-
pation of measuring ribbon in a draper’s shop, but I think
of the cold-blooded savage concealed beneath. I ask you
not to print my name, since the time has not yet come
when the truth is permitted.

The Man Who Looks Wise.
The correspondence that has lately been raging
between Premier Barton, of Australia, and Pre-
mier Lewis, of Tasmania, in re “Tattersall,”
has left the Flyspeck C.M.G. with a considerable
pain in his reputation. Somehow or other Mr.
Lewis has managed, in the course of years, to
work up some sort of local reputation as the pos-
sessor of more than ordinary brains. He is a
solemn, humorless person who has lived a respect-
able life, and is gifted with the faculty of looking
wise. He has never offended a political oppon-
ent, hardly ever had an opponent to offend had
he wanted a battle ever so much. While Brad-
don was boss of the Land of Dreams Lewis
was nominal leader of the nominal Opposition,
and filled the position with such decorum and
with so earnest a desire to “assist the Govern-
ment ” that Braddon grew to love him as a sick
younger brother, and took every opportunity of
pleasing him and his numerous relatives by judi-
cious compliments on his learnedness as a lawyer,
his kindliness as a critic of the Government,
and his high-standing as a statesman. The wily
Braddon’s compliments had probably as great an
influence in building up the unoffending Lewis’
reputation for wisdom as the Honorable Neil’s
own talent for looking wise. Throughout the
island there has been for sometime a vague, elusive,
half-expressed notion, hardening to a belief, that
some day Lewis would distinguish himself before
the nations ; it was felt that no man could possibly
continue to wear such a sagacious expression of
countenance and to preserve such a solemn
demeanor unless there was genius behind,
patiently awaiting an outlet. It seemed that the
opportunity had arrived for Lewis when this
“Tattersall” dispute cropped up, and many
prophets arose to predict the triumph of the
“brainy” State Premier. There is reason to
believe that the gentle Lewis himself was per-
suaded that the Hour had arrived and that Neil
Elliott Lewis, C.M.G. was the Man. He
entered his protest against the Federal Govern-
ment’s action in refusing to allow “TattersaLl”
letters to be carried by mail. In the course of a
carefully-edited epistle to Premier Barton it was
politely urged: (1) That “Tatt.” should be
allowed to carry on his sweeps until the High
Court could rule for or against the legality of the
Federal stoppage of letters ; (2) that the Federal
Government was infringing the spirit of Federation
by its rash interference with a State-sanctioned
institution; and (3) that Tasmania would lose
£ 20,000 a year by the proposed abolition of
“ Tattersall’s ” sweep business. This last point
was stressed as the most important. Barton sent
a cordial reply stating that he was glad to hear
that nothing more formidable than a loss of
revenue to Tasmania was the cause of his learned
friend’s distress, and assuring him that the
Federal Government would find a means of
making that prospective loss good. Then the fat
was in the fire, and Lewis is said to have come
nearer to saying a naughty word than ever in his
life before. He had either to stand forth as the
champion of a gambling monopoly, which would
be too shocking a thing for his respectability;
or he had to tell Barton that Tasmania wasn’t a
mendicant and that his money might perish with
him, which was foreign to Lewis’s colorless habit
of mind ; or to reply that the assurance offered
was too vague, and that he had heard of Barton’s
promises before —which would have been a suit-
able reply, only Lewis hadn’t the fighting capacity
to say things like that; or he had to meander
vaguely about State rights, which is a large, pale,
uninteresting subject that convinces nobody and
interests hardly anyone. So Lewis comes out
badly in the fight. He has hit his antagonist
severely with a feather and made no impression.

The Superfluous Upper House.
“ Kiwi ” contributes his mite to the discussion :
Your comment as to the superfluity of a Second Legis-
lative Chamber (B. 12 3/’O2) is well illustrated by the posi-
tion of affairs here (Maoriland). In the grand old days of
squatterdom and plutocracy the Leg. Council was just
such an excrescence as the present Vic. House of 48 Rich
Landlords. The Ballancb-Seddon Govt, mended matters
somewhat by the infusion of a fairly strong democratic
element. But at the same time it reduced the term of
membership from life to seven years. Now what is the
position? The present party in power has made about
30 appointments out of a chamber of 45 members. The
“lifers”— i.e.. those appointed before’92, and to whom
the septennial term does not apply—are rapidly becoming
less already, and the Council possesses a majority of
Govt, appointees, so that it is merely a duplicate of the
Seddonian majority in the Lower House. Of what
logical use, therefore, is a second Chamber which, instead
of being a Constitutional check on rash legislation
is a mere automaton of its maker? About the only purpose
our Second Chamber has now is that of a place of reward
for political friends, and the mode of securing appoint-
ment to it is to toady in excelsis to our “ Uncrowned
King.” This would not be so bad if Richard selected the
best men among his friends, but he often stuffs into the
Council some village Hampden who has never sat in the
Lower House and has had no further training than the
chairmanship of some obscure local body. Now the coming
power in this and every country is the Labor Party—if it
doesn’t allow itself to be fooled by appointments to offices
of emolument. But our Labor Party, instead of demand-
ing the abolition of the Second Chamber, is fishing after
more appointments thereto of Labor members. No
clean-handed party can afford to handle the pitch of
patronage and the working men must realise this if
they are to do any real good. If the Seddon Govt, could
last another 10 years the Council would be practically all
Seddonite— there might be a small or large Opposition in
the Reps., but there would be none in the Council. And
the Council would consist largely of men that the people
wouldn’t dream of electing to the Lower House—not
intelligent democrats, but the parasites who fawned on
Seddon and breathed only by his permission. A Council
which rejects the Assembly’s measures must be suppressed,
because it can’t be tolerated that any mere nominee or
property suffrage body shall reverse the will of the people.
And a Council that 'merely says ditto to the Assembly
ought to be suppressed. It is uselesss and its erawlsome-
ness is unwholesome. There is no room for an Upper
House in any well-devised Legislature.

Westralia’s Railway Troubles.
The action of the Westralian Government in
raising its railway freights by 25 per cent, has
created a shriek of rage and consternation which
appears to be much louder than the case calls for.
The old rates were much below the Australian
average, and the increased ones are certainly not
above the average. It is pointed out that the
Victorian lines cost over £12,000 and the N.S.W.
ones over £13,000 per mile, while the Westralian
railways—being mostly built over State lands in-
stead of over private property resumed at twice
its value, and being of rather cheap and shoddy
construction at best, and being mainly in level
country—cost only a shade over £5OOO per mile.
With less than half the interest burden to carry,
therefore, they should be able to charge lower
rates. But on the other hand N.S.W. and Vic-
toria have accumulated over £8,000,000 of railway
deficit apiece through carrying goods and pas-
sengers below paying rates, and it would be sheer
folly for Westralia to go and do likewise. That
State is the only one which hasn’t a great
railway deficit. It did most of its rail-
way building after the gold and loan boom
set in, and it enjoyed such a run of luck that it
has, so far, realised a net profit of some £600,000
over and above working expenses and interest.
If its Government had had sufficient sense to
devote these profits to reducing the railway debt
then the system would have had a smaller burden
to carry in the lean years which are certain to
arrive sooner or later, but it hadn’t—things like
that are never done in Australia. In the glorious
times of 1896 and 1897 and 1900, Westralia’s rail-
ways and rolling-stock were, to a great extent,
new and required little repair, and if the profits
of these and adjacent years had been applied in
reduction of the railway debt it would merely
have been the ordinary, necessary, business-like
process of writing off depreciation— but that also
is never done in Australia. Now things are at
sixes and sevens. Of the 262 locomotives it is
frankly admitted by the Minister that 154 are
cripples, and the supply of goods waggons has run
so low, mainly through decay and lack of repair,
that there are not nearly enough available
to do the work. Also, the repairing
shops are inadequate, and there is a
congestion of halt, maimed and blind roll-
ing stock waiting for attention. If the £600,000
or so of profits made in the good days had been
used to reduce the railway debt there would be
£20,000 a year saved in interest and available for
repairs ; but these things didn’t happen. In the
good days, when the boom was at its height,
Westralia had cheap freights, and ran its rolling
stock and its cheap, new, shoddy railways to
death, and made no allowance out of the profits
for the old age that was creeping over its assets.
In 1901 there was no more railway than in 1900, and
the number of miles run was actually less, but
expenses were more, and the year’s profit
fell from £162,000 to £65,000, and for this the
general wearing out of things was at least partly
responsible. Now it is reckoned that the current
year will show a loss of £53,000, and sundry con-
cessions in the way of shorter hours promised to
the employes are expected soon to make another
£BO,OOO a year loss. By reason, of all this, the
increased rates are probably inevitable, but Wes-
tralia apparently doesn’t understand it, and it sits
among its 154 crippled locomotives and asks what
the trouble is all about.

Taking Steps.
Melbourne Age publishes an article on the
“continuous dribble” of population out of Vic-,
toria, and asks what is to be done. The popula-
tion, of course, continues to increase, for the births
largely exceed both the deaths and the emigra-
tion, but still the fact that there are more depar-
tures than arrivals is a depressing circumstance.
It isn’t a novel circumstance. There are regions
in the British isles that are now. more thinly
peopled than Victoria, and from which the popu-
lation is still going out, but that fact makes the
Victorian situation no better. The Age’s remedy,
as usual, is something loose, vague, and general,
after this fashion :
A Government which knows its duty would take instant
steps with the object of preventing other dissatisfied
farmers from abandoning their holdings. This and future
Governments will also have to be wary and cautious in
their treatment of capital. The greater the extent to
which capitalists invest in Victorian interests the greater
the amount of work there will be for residents in the
country. To make the moneyed class suspicious and to
hamper and restrict it unnecessarily i 3 nothing short of
suicidal.
Whether the Government should chain these men
to a gum-tree, or in what other way it should pre-
vent them going, is left unexplained. Nor is any
definite suggestion offered as to why the small
Victorian farmer is thus clearing out. Probably
there are at least six reasons for it—at least this
writer thinks he can recognise six : (1) There
is a tendency to go to countries like
Westralia and New South Wales where the
Government is still splashing about borrowed
millions at a glorious rate. While the splashing
process lasts there is a fictitious prosperity with
which a sober-minded State can’t compete. (2)
The small fertile area of Victoria is already about
four times as crowded as any other agricultural
district of the same size in Australia. (3) In this
area the price of land is absurdly high, and the
rents demanded by a bowelless landlord class are
grossly exorbitant. Also, even in this narrow
district settlement is retarded in places by the
existence of big estates held by unprogressive
monopolists. A very weighty progressive land-
tax on large estates, on estates owned by absentees,
and on estates which are not worked by their
owners but are sub-let, together with an energetic
system of compulsory repurchase by the State,
would make room for a lot more population.
(4) The eastern part of the State, mostly mountain
and forest, is worth something, though not very
much, but it is almost without roads. The western
part, which is none too good but is also worth
something, is without water. The land-tax above
proposed might bring in another £150,000 a year
with which East Gippsland might be opened up
with roads and the mallee country irrigated.
Then there would be room for a vast amount more
settlement than there is. (5) More railways are
wanted to carry the settlers’ produce to the coast.
Railways are expensive largely by reason of the
ridiculous sums demanded by unscrupulous land-
lords for compensation. A more honest class of
landlords would be beneficial. (6) Lower railway
freights are urgently wanted to make farming
profitable, but these are hardly possible until part
of the railway debt is paid off. A lavish passing
of the hat among the rich men of Victoria,
and the raising of a million as the nucleus of a
railway sinking fund would be a good start
in the direction of this most urgent reform, and
The Bulletin suggests that a subscription be
opened immediately. These proposals may be
regarded as crude and violent, but they at least
embody a definite scheme for doing something.
Anybody can talk in a vague, spectral fashion
about “ taking steps ” to prevent rack-rented
farmers leaving their holdings, and about the
necassity of the Government speaking kindly to
“ capital ” as if capital was a lost cat out on a wet
night, but there is nothing definite about such
matters. The world is full of people whose
remedy for everything is that somebody should
“ take steps,” and the world is full of step?

From Arthur Griffith, M.L.A. :
The agitation for the reduction of the ' nembershfp of
the'popular House in the State Parliaments developes
more and more clearly into an attempt by the wealthy
classes to destroy the democratic legislation of the last
few years, and to substitute for the men who brought it
about, what the Arohs calls “ a more desirable class of
public man.” In New South Wales it is primarily a land-
owners’ movement against the Land Tax. Look at the
personnel! The principal speakers at the inaugural
meeting (at Oamden) were : Onslow, of Camden Park (a
vast area of our best agricultural land, stretching from
Menangle to Camden, which one of our Governors jobbed
away to Onslow’s grandfather in the corrupt days ere we
had a Parliament) ; Antill, of Picton, the owner
of a similarly acquired estate ; Downs, of Brownlow
Hill Estate, and Moors, of “ The Oaks.” All worthy
men as private citizens, but representative only of a
small class whose grandfathers got hold of the best
of our lands when there was no Legislative Assembly,
and who, not unnaturally, hate the institution that has
dared to tax it. They would propose—not the reduction
—but the abolition of the Lower House, if they thought
they had a hope in that direction. If the men of this
class and their allies in the press can succeed in weaken-
ing or destroying the democratic element in our Assem-
bly, they may also succeed in obtaining a repeal of the
land and income taxes. As a matter of fact, it would
not need a very serious readjustment in the personnel of
the Assembly to accomplish this, and these people know
it. We cannot, surely, be expected to believe that men
of wealth and influence, who hitherto have taken no part
in public matters (except to oppose the land and income
taxes), have been suddenly smitten with a patriotic
enthusiasm for an economy of some 2£d. per inhabitant
annually—the amount to be saved by abolishing the
salaries* of 30 or 40 members of Parliament. No 1 they
have a much bigger thing on 1

Prahran (Melb. ) City Council has rejected, by
seven votes to four, a proposal to open the local
public library for a few hours on Sundays. Never-
theless, the defeat in this case gives promise of
victory all along the Melbourne line. Sab-
batarian arguments against the opening of libraries
and picture-galleries on the one day of the week
when the general public want them opened have
only to be published from time to time in cold
print to work their own undoing. When the em-
ployment of Sunday labor was referred to as an
“ evil ” inseparable from the proposed innovation
three of the Prahran councillors volunteered to
employ themselves in taking charge of the little
library on the “Day of Rest,” which is a day of
work for many people, particularly parsons. So
the humanitarian “gag” was silenced. “The

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Peasants raided the State granary at Turkalinsk, in the
province of Tomsk, Sibera. One hundred peasants died
of famine prior to the revolt.
Five hundred infantry in Poltava declined to fire on a
crowd of people, which included women and girls. The
soldiers declared they would not shoot women. All the
soldiers were tried bv court-martial, and every tenth man
shot. The remainder were degraded and sentenced to
penal servitude.
Peasants arrested for rioting have been knouted—in
many cases to death.—Gable News.
The hissing tongue of horse-hide black,
Swung by the Cossack’s hand :
The dark blood from the peasant’s back
Congealing on the sand.
With bubbling breath, to brutal scoff,
Life quits the writhing lips,
And thy life’s sun, O Romanoff !
Veers to its last eclipse.
The twice ten thousand royal spies,
The million butcher braves,
Siberia’s mines, Saghalien’s sties,
The white Steppes’ untold graves—
The knout, the rod, the axe, the cord,
The battue on the plain,
The priest’s own God, the Czar’s own Lord,
Are impotent and vain.
The tabernacled eikons quake,
The palace beauties pale,
The loosened knees of Order shake
Though Law girds on its mail.
For through flogged women’s wailing breath,
And groans of knouted men,
And sobs of childhood clemmed to death
The Terror speaks again.
Hail! to the Terror! Hail! All hail!
The dagger, bomb, and brand :
Hail Hell itself —if Hell avail —
To purge the accursed land.
Knouted to death ! Fate says not so.
Knouted to life at last,
To render back, straight, blow for blow,
With interest on the past.

Continental Sunday ” is another aged British
“gag” that doesn’t seem to meet the
situation in Melbourne. For there the Saw-
bathian street corner is apt to present a
frivolous appearance, inasmuch as numbers
of young men in ungodly felt, hats are fooling
around, with nothing but girl and blasphemy to
engage their thoughts, what time their distant
English relatives are having a comparatively con-
tinental time at the public-house. In a country
whose pet vice is street-loafing, the Sunday library
and picture-gallery would have the unanimous
support and all-round blessing of the police, and
yet the Mayor of Prahran assured his four fiery
radical councillors that the opening of any insti-
tution, save church, during church hours would
be a Disgrace. Also, the majority of seven
accepted his worship’s utterances as an everlasting
truth. But the voice of the average mayor is not
always going to be the voice of God in these
matters.

In general dramatic interest “ Boy Jim ”
is not on a par with “The Gates of Bondage,”
previously staged by the Woods-Williamson co.
at Sydney Criterion. The drama looks as if it
were merely hung round the great fight for the
championship in Act IV. The man who enacts
the Gloucester champion is a professional pugilist
and Alf. Woods a good amateur, so it is not to be
wondered at that some man in the audience lost
their heads on the opening night and betted on
one or other of them, forgetting that the real pug.
has to be knocked out and that backing him is
utter waste. One man realised this when it was
too late, and his cries about what he called “me
splosh ” were heartrending. Ted Wilson falls with
reluctance, while Alf. Woods’ stage mother breaks
into the ring, and, having concealed Alf's sonship
for years for no reason at all, proclaims it publicly
from the same motive. The rest of the play con-
sists mostly of modern rifle and old-fashioned
overcoat —also modern overcoat —with allusions to
co-operative stores that didn’t exist in the days of
Rodney Stone. Rodney himself is a dreadful
sketch, which mercifully fades away as the
drama progresses. Somebody called Dorothy
Clyde appears from nowhere, in order to be res-
cued from a badly-dressed and starved-looking
nobleman. There is a great deal of explanation in
this piece, about a ghost which is not produced,
about a crime which is not seen, and about a
hidden lord, who is brought forward at the last
moment in a dressing-gown and slippers, in which
costume he is understood to have glode about a
certain house for many to escape justice.
» * * *
The Bulletin is confirmed in its good
opinion of Alf. Woods, whose rendering of an
adventurous youth is artistic and free from
romantic exaggeration. The manner in which he
depicts that youth in a sulky humor, with a dis-
inclination to honest toil (this is a sign of noble
blood on the stage), has many clever touches
about it. Miss Williamson, as his actress-ma,
looks imposing in black velvet. The part is about
as melancholy as the sea on a wet day, but no
fault can be found with Miss Williamson’s render-
ing of it. Harry Douglas is a nice, good-
humored baronet, but does not give the necessary
impression of a middle-aged dandy, the set of
whose necktie is a matter of life or death.
The village blacksmith is neatly acted by John
Hesford, and various nice girls romp on and off in
early nineteenth century costumes for purposes
that are mostly ornamental. The referee at the
championship fight on Saturday night found the
publicity too much for him and gibbered through
the only sentence he had to say, but he refereed
with promptness and decision which, after all,
is the main thing.
** * «
No new ideas of any importance concern-
ing the “Runaway Girl” have occurred to The
Bulletin since last week. Further study of that
cheerful nothing makes the indefinite lay brother
with the shorn and shaven head retreat further
into the background, and the large fat British
tourist appear a person of diminishing importance,
while the whirl of skirts and stockings in the
“Man from Cook’s” hurdle race comes further to
the front as the p. incipal episode of the play. So
far all the ladies have jumped beautifully, and
none of them have fallen, and there is no sign of
any one running stiff. It seems to be the only
race in Sydney which is absolutely above suspicion.
The city has now made up its mind definitely as
to which lady shows the most alarming amount of
stocking as she jumps. It is the same lady every
night, and the public has ascertained, by inquiry
at all the leading drapers, that stockings like these
can’t be purchased for less than 10s. fid. a pair.
** * *
At Sydney Palace, the World’s Enter-
tainers are entertaining in about the same way as
usual, and comedian Platt still relates how, as a
doctor, he cured a baby (“ given up ” by the whole
faculty) so thoroughly that it got to a weight of
b., simply by prescribing elephants’ milk as
a diet—it was an elephant’s baby, by the way.
“The Merry World ” has entered upon a second
edition, which is as merry as the first. Bunth and
Rudd have withdrawn the foolish Chinese act and
returned to something’ funny.
** * *
“In Sight of St. Paul’s ” has negotiated
its second week at Sydney Lyceum, where the
great fire and the rest of the realism
make the audience forget that the hero is
an imbecile and Mrs. Bland Holt a lodg-
ing-house slavey too self-sacrificing for this
world. The Cathedral scene in the last act
is as impressive as ever, and calculated to send the
audience home in a religious frame of mind. St.
Paul’s has no special bearing on the drama, and,
as almost every story happens in view of some
large building or mountain or other landmark,
there is no great relevancy about the title of the
play. But it is a title that sounds well and is easy
to invent.
** * *
Harris and Walters, new-comers at Sydney
Tivoli on Saturday, had a cordial welcome from
the audience but did not impress the writer as
more than a comedian who jokes with difficulty and
a lady who sings with the same substance. Peggy
Pryde is still the prime favorite, and doesn’t sing
the “ Honeysuckle and the Bee ” now; so she
deserves to be. Callahan and Mack come a good
second in public favor.
** * *
At the Newbury-Spada concerts the popu-
lace has been recuperating its jaded sense of hear-
ing, every Wednesday and Saturday night. The
ear that has been long afflicted by such discords as
street bands, ’buses racing over blocks, trams and
the Australian accent, takes considerable healing,
and the Newbury-Spada pair pour in the balm
with musicianly skill. Next Saturday night' will
be a great one for Scotland, the pop on that
occasion being a Scotch pop.
** * *
“ Uncle Tom’s Cabin ” was staged at the
Sydney Empire on Saturday, while The Bulle-
tin’s representative was at another theatre look-
ing at another Shock. When said representative
called at the venerable little house on Monday
it was closed, owing, it is said, to the illness of
Mr. John Cosgrove. John was billed for the villain
Marks, and brother Tom as his namesake of the
Cabin. Thomas, who is rather a comedian than
anything else, probably ascended to Heaven on
strictly humorous principles ; but all these things
are now guesswork. A large number of ‘new
names appeared on the bill, and the remark that
the negro slaves would be personated by a host of
auxiliaries sounded large and satisfying, but
whether the host were three or five this writer
cannot say. It is alleged that the Empire will
re-open on Saturday.
#* * *
If Melbourne felt a violent admiration for
Miss Janet Waldorf, the present “ Romeo and
Juliet” show, at Her Majesty’s, would perhaps be
better liked than a more massive and “ reverent ”
staging of that corpse-strewn romance, such as the
public suffered cheerfully for the sake of Mrs.
Potter-oum-Bellew, or Miss Jenyns, who had no
Bellow to help her. As far as a tearful five-act
Shakespearian drama, with five dead bodies in it,
can be made quick and interesting, this perform-
ance supplies the want. The Bard’s dialogue has
been judiciously pruned. One misses some of the
original superfluous characters, and doesn’t mourn
their absence. The general working of the business
seems to study economy in time, as well as in
scenery. Better for the spectacular effects to be
underdone than overdone, seeing that “Romeo
and Juliet ” offers no opportunities for gorgeous
frivolity. Parts of the performance are good, the
Mercutio (H. H. Vincent), and Friar Lawrence
(Atholwood) being very good. Edmund Gwenn—
the clown in “ As You Like It ’’—makes a quaint,
incisive Peter, whilst Mrs. Hill, as the old nurse,
and Melford and Miss Lane, as the parental
Capulets, put in careful work. Elsewhere feeble-
ness is the complaint. Some of the young men
of Verona who have little to do are not equal to
doing it for all it is worth, although they carry
their clothes confidently.
* * * •
Of Miss Waldorf and Norval McGregor in
the name parts, the present scribe would say that
they are overweighted most of the time. They
fail respectably. They arouse no enthusiasm and
excite no scorn in the audience. Romeo shows a
youthful figure and a neat style, and Miss Waldorf
is a rather pretty Juliet with a considerable talent
for acting. But her husky elocution, which has
the mannerisms of Mrs. Potter and Miss Duggan,
is so indistinct that it grows wearisome in long
speech. Next Saturday (17th) “Twelfth Night”
will be played for the first time since the Essie
Jenyns period.
** * *
At the Royal a tall medical gentleman
continues to disguise himself in a huge false nose
for obscure purposes of crime. Also a street arab
enters the service of a horse trainer, and is
allowed to wear his golden hair in a chignon at
the back, out of respect for the ’orses, or because
he is the missing child of a widow who runs the
racing stable and loves the trainer. But as the
boy’s relation to the sporting wid. is not suspected
until he has pulled her out of a cistern, she can
hardly be the reason why he doesn’t get his hair
cut. “ The Favorite ” threatens to win the Leger
for another two or three weeks, anyhow, and in
the meantime the mystery of Willard’s fictitious
nose will be further investigated, together with
the sad case of Stirling Whyte, a bookmaker who
says he loves to lose money in the interests of
sport.
** * *
Frank Thornton and co., at Melb. Prin-
cess’s, are still engaged upon the case of Mrs.
Smith, the parson’s wife, who goes to roost in the
right Mr. Smith’s bedroom, which opens out of
that unpractical citizen’s sitting-room and leads
to a long string of complications. “Facing the
Music ” is a sufficiently brisk and ingenious farcical
comedy of the old type. When the wrong Mrs.
Smith meets her lawful parson in the other Smith’s
apartment, the gentle shepherd doesn’t explain
the situation to her, and although the other
Smith could squelch the misunderstanding at one
verbal blow as soon as he arrives upon the scene,
he prefers to go mad every time the female in-
truder crosses his domestic path. Also the wrong
Mrs. Smith is persuaded by a casual detective to
play the part of the right Smith’s housekeeper
and serve his wife with breakfast, whilst the real
housekeeper, who presumably makes the coffee,
stands around in the kitchen, or somewhere, and
says nothing. The little leaven of probability
that leavens the whole lump of extrava-
?ance_ in some farces is not discernible
in ‘Facmg the Music,” nevertheless Thornton
a nd 00. make it travel. And the curtain-raiser,
thanks to Joseph Wilson’s clever character acting,
is a bright streak of eccentricity. Thusfar the
ladies of the co. have not improved oh acquaint-
ance, with the exception of Miss Katie Lee. This
trim little body would be a striking reminder of
her late sister Ada if she were more exactly like
the original Jennie, and she seems to have come
provided with a fair share of the family talent.
** * *
In “Why Smith Left Home” the new
cook, the different count, and other members of
a reconstructed cast were quite at home after the
first performance or two, and the angel-cake
would, doubtless, have been hovering around
Smith's auntie all this week if the Bijou manage-
ment were not pressed for time. “The Wrong
Mr. Wright ” was due for revival on Wednesday,
at the instigation of Special Request, who is first
u? US j n to ®' enera .l Desire. The millionaire in the
blood-red vest will bloom again for three nights
only, after which “ What Happened to Jones ” is
going to *ry the effect of new faces in the old
parts. Then the Willoughby Comedy Co. will
tear itself away in the direction of Adelaide.
** * *
At the Opera House all goes well with
Wootwell. Also the charming little lady accom-
plice of the gentleman in the violet clothes is pro-
gressing favorably, and the programme includes
some items which were not there last week.

Adelaide Royal has been doing record
business with “Sweet Nell.” House full every
night for two weeks, with one piece, and that not
an opera. It has now declined upon the “ Sorrows
of Satan” and other people, without Nellie Stewart.
The Tivoli is closing down for a month or so,
after two years uninterrupted vaudeville (another
record for Adelaide.) Rickards proposes to lease
the house occasionally, while transferring his co.
to Broken Hill and elsewhere. “ The Wrong Mr.
Wright” accordingly appears at this house.

Increase .. £240,325 £578,925 £338,600
Things, however, are made to look a little better in the
Government’s statement of accounts by reckoning cer-
tain trust funds—the rents derived from other people’s
property in the resumed area of Sydney—as revenue,
after this fashion :

Increase.. £370,863 £578,925 £208,062
The large increase of revenue is more than swallowed up
by the still larger increase of expenditure. Last year
ended with a heavy deficit, and so far as the current year
has gone things are much worse than they were last year.
As regards the loan expenditure it also increases daily :

As all the loan money already raised has been spent, and
over £3,340,000 has been temporarily borrowed from
trust funds and other sources to keep the loan account
going, another large raising of money should be about
due in New South Wales.
During the last ten months N.S.W. has had
really £BlO,OOO more revenue to deal with than it had
last year. The loss of £570,000 postal receipts was coun-
terbalanced by the fact that the Federal Government
also took over the expenditure of this wholly unprofitable
department, therefore this can’t be reckoned a decrease.
So without including the rents of the resumed area,
which are not revenue in any fair or justifiable
sense of the term, the See-O’Suilivan Government is
getting extra revenue at the rate of very nearly £1,000,000
a year. Old-age pensions absorb fully half of that, leaving
about £500,000 a year to deal with. Increased road votes
and increased wages and other expenses on the railways
and tramways, have swallowed up part of this—perhaps
£300,000. The increased interest bill, that ever-growing
octopus which gets larger with every loan that is floated,
probably accounts for the rest. In addition, £338,000 has
been spent beyond the increased revenue. Before the
Commonwealth started there was great argument about
“ What N.S.W. would do with its surplus.” The surplus
has been done with all right. The problem of what
N.S.W. will do with its deficit is the real trouble now.

Queensland shows up a little better now than it
did at this time last year :
Queensland (10 months to 30th April.)
Revenue. Expenditure. Surplus.
1901 .. £3,503,294 £3,358,095 £145,199
1902 .. 3,017,608 2,804,780 212,828
Decrease £485,686 £553,315
Increase _ £67,629
Queensland has about £737,000 to pay in interest at the
end of June (every year that devouring monster, the
interest-bill, grows £40,000 to £60,000 larger by reason of
fresh borrowings), so it looks as if the deficit’would not
be far short of £500,000 after all. Yet (allowing for the
fact that the postal revenue does not appear now in the
State balance-sheet), the revenue for the year ended June,
1902, promises to be far larger than it was in 1898 or any
previous year—and in these days Queensland paid its
way, and had something over. There is almost sufficient
increase since 1898 to cover the extra interest payable
through increase in the public debt. The trouble arises
solely out of the fact that the Philp Government (allowing
for the fact that postal, telegraph, customs, and excise
expenditure no longer appear in the State balance-
sheet) is spending at the rate of nearly £650,000
a year more than the Bvrnes and Nelson
Government did in ’9B—ab .ut £200,000 extra goes in
interest and £450,000 dribbles away. As a financial
dribbler Philp has few equals. Queensland has never
recovered from his great deed in jumping up the expen-
diture from £4,024,170 in 1899 to £4,855,533 in 19ul. That
created the great deficit—a ghost that has never been laid
since.
Victoria supplies less information about its
finances than any other State, but it appears that the
for the ten months to 30th April, 1902, was
£5, <69,906, as compared with £6,150*524 or thereabouts
up to same date last year, a falling-away of £380,618.
otill, the loss of the postal revenue is more than sufficient
to account for all of this, and as the postal expenditure is
ornVwS?®’ v em ' er Peacock ought to be really between
£50,000 and £lOO,OOO better off than he was last year.
But, in| the absence of reports of expenditure, how that
pale, elderly-young man’s accounts will turn out is pure
conjecture.

Affairs in South Australia are thus £181,140 worse than
they were at this date last year, and last year ended with
a small deficit, which was only turned into a small sur-
plus by treating certain trust funds as revenue. S.A.’s
situation is about the worst of the lot.
3tralia ’ s revenue for April (£342,718) was
±89,066 more than the revenue for April, 1901. It was
also £10,793 more than the largest previous month’s
revenue c ver collected in the State The fact that Groper-
land gets the full benefit of the Federal tariff, and is also
allowed (as no other State is) to collect its inter-State
duties just as before (a privilege of which it avails itself to
“ e u ™ e rmost farthing) is responsible for this (the fact
that the first 6d. received as revenue from the Ooolgardie
water scheme came in last month, when the supply
reached Northam, has nothing to do with the case, for the
coin was embezzled out of the consolidated revenue and
jpven to Bigjohn to hang on his watch-chain). Yet the
Westralian Federal members mostly preach Freetrade,
and, instead of urging their own State Government to get
a large measure of Freetrade by abolishing its border
duties, they demand further reductions of the Federal
tariff. Westralia, with its border duties, can do with a
lower tariff than the other States which have no border
duties, and the W.A. Freetrade members have as much
regard for the other States as a rhinoceros might have.
Next October, the first reduction of 20 per cent, in the
Westralian inter-State tariff falls due, and, after that, it
is to be reduced by 20 per cent, annually till it wholly
disappears, so the present boom is only temporary. Mean-
while, there is already a surplus of £259,775, and out of
that Premier Leake proposes to build the Port Hedland
to Marble Bar railway and a section of the Maloolm-
Laverton railway, also to purchase the Oanning-Jarrah
line. The proposal to build even one or two small lines
out of revenue is a shock to the old borrowing tradition
that is calculated to make somebody fall down dead from
sheer astonishment.
Affairs look a shade better for the last two months in
Tasmania. Expenditure accounts are not published, but
for the first four months of the island’s financial year
(which starts on Ist Jan.) revenues have compared as
follows:

things look a fraction less gloomy than they did is the
great expansion of railway revenue, which is generally a
reliable sign of prosperity.

The great law case, Wadey v. Mort’s Dock and
Engineering Co. (Sydney), ended with a verdict against
the co. for £11,139. Costs are said to be about £lO,OOO
which makes roughly £21,000. Also, it is said that both
parties intend applying for a new trial. It is a case of
such dimensions that it takes 35 days to explain it, and
the possibilities in the way of getting new trials (at
several thousand pounds each) are very large. Mort’s
Dock Co. has £30,570 of reserves, and the Wadey case
looks quite capable of swallowing them all.

Melbourne stockbroker Meudell, who seems to
have bought a calculating machine at a bargain sale, and
is heaving vast masses of figures about, made some quaint
observations in Melb. Age the other day. Among other
things he threw these figures at an unprepared public :
Victoria. France.
Persons per Member of Parliament 7000 43,000
Debt per head £54 2 0 £3l 3 0
Total trade per head .. .. 29 18 9 92 0
Revenue per head 6 14 9 8 13 0
Expenditure per head .. .. 613 2 313 0
Interest per head 1 18 6 0 16 11
This, of course, is the same old swindle by which the
lightly-taxed rich men of Victoria are trying to strike
public sympathy as an oppressed and down-trodden race.
The affair is worked by comparing the French national
revenue (which does not include any railway receipts,
these going to private companies) with the national
revenue and the railway receipts of Victoria. The Vic-
torian pays annually £2 15s. 3d. in railway fares, which
are not taxation, seeing that he gets better value for them
than the Frenchman does for the fares he pays to private
companies. He pays ss. to make up the railway deficit,
which arises from the fact that, in proportion to popula-
tion, he gets four times the railway accommodation that
the Frenchman does. And he pays about £3 14s. 6d. in
ordinary revenue, against the Frenchman’s alleged £3 13s.
—it should be £3lss. 2d. And as both Victoria and France
are getting deeper in debt through insufficiency of
revenue the sooner Peacock increases the above taxes the
better. If Meudell doesn’t like it he can become a
Frenchman and call himself “ Mossoo.”

the underground haulage, doing away with the old costly
system of trucking. The work is now done by electric
locomotives at a much reduced cost, the whole of the
drivers and surface works is also lighted from the same
installation. This company has also supplied electric
pumping plants to the Sons of Gwalia mine, and probably
the largest electric pumps in the world for the Charlotte
Plains and New Hapilah mines at Maldon. Having
secured the services of a well known European expert,
they are now prepared to advise, and contract for any
electrical service such as lighting, pumping, haulage,
traction, rock drilling, or the generation and transmission

- Insurance policies are in most of the States pro-
tected by statute against the creditors of the assured, but
the protection has been rendered worthless, in the many
cases in which the assured leaves a will containing the
words, “ after payment of my just debts,” by the con-
struction the courts have put upon those words. After a
big struggle with the Leg. Council, the law was recently
altered by a cumbrous section which protected policies
even although these words occurred in the will, except in
certain cases. But the good old coach-and-four has
already found a metalled road through this merciful little
charter of the widow and orphan. Some of the most im-
portant safeguards in the section merely apply, it is being
found, to insurance policies payable only on death. See-
ing that, nowadays, a large proportion, perhaps the
majoritv, of policies are payable on the attaining of a
certain age as well as on death, a speedy amendment of
the law is desirable—until which will-makers who do not
want their wives and children to starve, can be recom-
mended to make their policies safe by simply omitting
the quite unnecessary words “upon payment of my just
debts ” from their wiil9.

The co. appears to be highly prosperous, hut its balance-
sheets are a bewildering aggravation. They lump to-
gether interest on deposits, which is a fixed charge, and
dividends to shareholders, in one lump sum. The balance
at the beginning of the year is shown, also the balance at
the end after paying these amounts, but it being im-
possible to accurately disentangle the dividend the exact
profits can’t be got at. Sometimes the report states that
the dividend is 8 and 9 per cent. Sometimes it merely
savs the usual dividend is paid. And now and then it is
accidentally mentioned in the report—not in the balance-
sheet—how much the profits come to and the sum
absorbed in dividends. This habit appears to become
more frequent of late. The capital now amounts to
£7O 425, so the total shareholders funds are 1 j8,d70.
Deposits are £95,906, and the institution holds cash and
liquid securities, £BO4O. The dividend is unusually mag-
nificent for these rather unprofitable times.

In addition to the above there is an item described as
“Sundry Reserves, £20,813,” and if it is included the
total reserves reach £255,112. “Sundry Reserves” is a
steadily growing item, but the nature of it isn’t explained
and there is nothing to show where the accretions come
from. As last year’s profits represent £2O Is. 7d. per
cent, on the co.’s paid-up capital, Burns, Philp and Co. is
enjoying good fortune that is far beyond the^average.
The contest between the English Jews and the
American Jews for the monopoly of the British tobacco

to retailers if they would handle their goods only and
boycott the American people’s stuff, the latter have
replied offering to give up their entire net profits
in England for the next four years, and also
£BOO,OOO in cold cash, as bonuses to those retailers who
stand by them ; and they ask for no boycott of the other
man’s goods, condemning that as “ un-English ” ! So far
the American Jews seem to have the best of it; they’ve
got the money and got the tactics too.

Some recent figures relating to the Northern
Steamship Co. of Auckland Maoriland : >
, Total
Profits. Dividends. Reserves
March, 1900 7 per cent. = £3589 £37,825
„ 1901 £7380 7 „ „ 4967 40,238
„ 1902 4797 7 „ „ 4875 40,160
Probably the reserves will prove £4OO less than this, the
annual meeting having a habit of voting the directors that
sum as honorarium after the balance-sheet is published.
The earnings are steadily increasing, but an unusual
expenditure in repairs causes an apparent falling off.
Paid up capital is £69,642, so by comparison the reserves
are very solid. The one mysterious and unpromising
item in the balance-sheet of the Northern Steamship Co.
is the very large liability described as “ Accounts owing
by Company.” In 1900, this stood at 133,712 ; in 1901 it
was £31,520 ; by the present year it had risen to 136,118.
This is an enormous sum, equal to more than half the
paid-up capital, and whether it includes bank overdraft,
mortgages or open accounts, or all three of them, it
suggests that the co. is trading on very insufficient
capital and is consequently' in difficulties. The entire
shareholders’ capital and reserves only amount to
£109,802, and as the co. has £131,268 invested in
ships alone, to say nothing of the money locked up in
premises, it seems that being deeply' in debt must be its
chronic state. It has practically no liquid assets, and
apparently no loose cash to pay its dividend with ; and
at the present rate of progress the process of accumulating
funds with which to pay off the liabilities promises to be
a work of many years. The balance-sheet does not show
how much this state of things costs the co. in interest,
but the situation suggests that it would be highly advis-
able to reduce the dividend to 5 per cent, and keep it at
that till the co. is able t» trade with its own funds
exclusively.

The Coastal Farmers’ Co-operative Society of

balance-sheets since its formation two years ago :

f 6 „ „ 1041
„ 1902 - 1528 -! 20 p.c. bonus to V 418
( consignors = 1262 J
The Coastal Farmers’ Co-operative Society looks like a
very prosperous and promising concern which might
easily come to a bad end, though there is very little posi-
tive evidence to go upon. It has £1753 paid-up capital,
so the total shareholders’ funds are £2171. It owes
£11,896, and it has owing to it “ outstanding accounts
due to society, £12,849.” The business is growing very-
fast, and this item is growing along with it. Not
being a coastal farmer, writer _ has no clear idea
by whom these amounts are owing or how they are
secured, but it certainly looks as if the failure of
one debtor might pretty well wipe out the society,
and as if it would be advisable to accumulate some
solid reserves as a protection. The private co., or
private dealer, doesn’t give any bonus to consignors ;
this is bad for consignors, but, in the same circumstances,
he would be £1262 further ahead as a guarantee against
accidents. If consignors didn’t reach out for more than
15 per cent, at first, the institution might get more
securely on its legs.

This little concern has £15,000 paid-up capital and £2024
of deposits. Its reserves consist of depreciation fund,
£2600 ; and undivided profits, £lll. The whole working
expenses for the half-year are set down at £7B 3s. The
funds are almost all invested in mortgages—rather less
(bra £20,000 of them altogether—and the co. seems to
spend a quiet life watching this small sum. A consider-
able improvement, however, has set in, and it seems as
if the good days of ten years ago might return. The co.
is only 12 years old. In its very first year it held about
£13,000 of deposits, and promised to be a large concern,
but the slump came, and Tasmanian people have had
very little money to deposit anywhere since then.

The Lion Brewery and Malting Co. (Adelaide)
concluded a rather desolate half-year on 31st January,
1902. The last two years’ record has been as follows :
Profits. Dividends. Reserves.
January, 1900 £226
July, 1900 £2217 6 per cent. = £lBlB 625
January, 1901 1416 5 „ „ 1818 223
July, 1901 2494 6 „ „ 1818 899
January, 1902 976 6 „ „ 1818 67
This is not a promising position for a co. which has kept
up the beer-struggle for 14 years. The Lion Brewery was
floated in 1888, the vendors guaranteeing 10 per cent,
dividends till 1892. Since then the dividends have
never risen above 5 per cent. The co. has a paid-
up capital of £74,240. A small amount of forfeited
capital has apparently gone into the business and been
absorbed—certainly it doesn’t appear in the form of any
reserve fund. Within the last two years the liability on
mortgages, loans, and bank overdraft has been reduced
from £26,638 to £25,053, but this has only been done by
reducing the stock. The Lion Co. might as well face the
fact that it isn’t earning 5 per cent, just at present, and
cut down its dividend to 4 per cent. Also, for a co.
which is so heavily burdened, there are good points about
3 per cent.
* * * *
Broken Hill Proprietary pays a div. (£48,000),
the first this year. Last half year the co. made a profit
of £56,293 without allowances for depreciation ; it never
reports what its metals realise, but apparently the prices
were £ll lls. 6d. for lead and 2s. o£d. for silver. These
times a Id. per oz. movement in silver is, so far as the
B.H. Prop, is concerned, equal to an Bs. per ton movement
in lead. In regard to the other B.H. cos. a movement
in silver is less important. On the figures quoted the big
co. can’t be making quite a shilling div. (£48,000) per half
year, even allowing nothing off for depreciation. Of course,
iittle economies are still being introduced, but all the big
schemes one hears of hang fire somehow. There is
snarling and snapping again between the B.H. Prop, and
the Silverton Tramway Co. The former says the latter is
not taking its fair share of slump-results. The big mining
co. says that it paid it to build a line of its own to the
Iron Knob, and it might pay to build another cheap 30
miles from the mine to the S.A. line at Cockburn. More
will be heard of this. ’JJhe B.H. Prop. Co. is actually
putting up at its own expense a reading and writing room
for the men who work at the desulphurising kilns—a
little isolated hell a few miles out of town, along the rail-
way. General-Manager Delprat takes an interest in such
things—the first of the line who has done so.
* * * •
Block 10 shares are firmer “ in consequence of
the co. having made a profit on the past six months
operations. This is very satisfactory in view of the low
price,” &e. And it is. But the ore in this mine has been
picked during the last six months as it never was picked
before. When it was seen lately that a small profit was
being made it was suggested by some of the directors
that it should be doubled by putting the mill on two
shifts instead of only one. But it couldn’t be done;
there was not enough of the best ore available to do it.
Of course this skimming of the mine is going to make
Block 10 a tougher problem by-and-bye.
* * « •
A few days since, the cabled price of silver was
3-16ths of a penny under 2s. This is probably the lowest
figure at which the metal has been quoted. There has
been a recovery of about Jd., which encourages the silver-
mine speculators. It speaks volumes for the management
of the B.H. mines that, despite the low prices of silver
and lead, they can pay divs. Had the business been
understood at the outset as it is now, what a harvest
would have been reaped 1 A slight fall in Proprietary
shares is attributed, not so much to the low price of
metals, as to the large holding of the late James Dick
being placed on the London market.

“Sessil”: “Glen Dale” tinfield, Dry Creek,
Bundarra district (N.S.W.), was found by J. Robinson,
three years since : now three parties on field, including
Robinson’s, Pearce’s, and Ready’s. As usual, all are
hampered by lack of water, having washed no dirt since
last year. About 300 loads at grass. Country a succes-
sion of gutters, running from edge of tableland hard by.
Within short distance latter shows numerous lode indica-
tions. Pearce tunnelled for atime with 7s. 6d. per foot Govt,
grant, and got good specimens right through, but had to
abandon work through lack of means. Wash will go a
fair 401 b. per load all through gutters, and is from 3 to
4ft. average depth. Carries dark grey metal, and there
are other indications that the alluvial field is not of great
extent.

“ C.P.” : Ryder and party’s “ Commonwealth ”
block of 40 odd acres, near the head of Bora Creek
(N.S.W.), is interesting as being the top of the diamond
drift, so far. The stones increase in size as this is fol-
lowed up, and from Ryder’s have come some of the
finest yet found. Worked for five years under the most
primitive conditions, without machinery, etc. the tin won
paid all working exes., the diamonds being clear profit.
Gold and silver are also found. Should any remarkable
diamondiferous discovery be made in the district, it will
probably be near this claim.
Shuttleton mine, near Nym agree (N.S.W.) said
to rival Great Cobar in its palmiest days. Option-holders
have completed purchase—£3o,ooo cash, which they have
netted from shipping ore for less than half the time of the
option. Melbourne has appropriated the plum, and a £5
rise in copper would probably mean a £500,000 flotation.
Property was offered to a Sydney firm for a modest sum
in four figures. Reports were submitted to a well-known
expert for his opinion, and he returned them with this
comment: “ 111-conceived lies ; it would be waste of time
to inspect show.” Now he is a doubly-cursed man—he
joins his principals in anathematising himself.

Corowa jubilant over the discovery of gold in the

co. has a large amount of dead work to do ere it can hope
for payable returns. It has made more calls than any other
mine in N.S.W. Shareholders all local men, which means
that, practically, they are Victorians. Genuine Sydney-
siders would not have had the patience to stick to
a pumping show for five years, neither would they have
been clever enough to wheedle solid assistance out of the
Govt. The longrtalked-of scheme to form a big English
co. to work the late “Johnny” Wallace’s Quat Quatta
estate on the N.S.W. side of the river may now be heard
of again. The nucleus of this scheme will be the granting
of a special lease of 1000 acres, which, hitherto—always,
in the interests of labor—N.S.W. department has bucked
against. Estimated that to work the Rutherglen lead in
this area an initial expenditure of £lOO,OOO will be
necessary. * • .

Reported that an English co. has been formed
to work the Vegetable Creek (N.S.W.) deep lead for tin.
V.O. shallow alluvial was as rich in tin, correspondingly,
as Forest Creek, Ballarat and Bendigo gullies were in
gold, and there can be no doubt that there are immense
bodies of pay wash in the basalt-capped deep ground. If
the co. picks up the gutter where it was last worked, if
it avoids the customary extravagances of London
management, and if the full capital is reasonably pro-
portionate to the actual working capital, writer, who
knows the locality well, believes that there will be
successful results, assuming that tin keeps above £lOO
per ton.

Blayney (N.S.W.): New syndicate has started

Shaft to be sunk to 400 ft., and lode to be syste-
matically opened up between 300 and 400 ft. levels
before smelting is ■" ~ ed. Had the old co. been

which enveloped it.

The Lloyd-Burraga copper-mine (N.S.W.) in
full swing again. Concentrating plant now working
fairly well. This mine, despite the disadvantage of
nearly 40 miles of mountainous road-carriage, shares the
distinction, with Great Cobar and Mt. Lyell, of being a
profit-earner with copper at £52 per ton, but, unlike the
other two, it has no precious-metal value to bolster it up.
The 15-year-old story about the lode dipping into an
adjoining block is once more in circulation. The late
Lewis Lloyd’s sardonic smile at the mention of this sug-
gestion ought to have been snap-shotted and printed for
the information of shareholders in the new co.

Brown’s Creek mine, near Blayney (N.S.W.)
about to be unwatered which is regarded as
a “ hopeful sign that the mine will soon be
at work again, which will be a great boon to
the district.” The unwatering process looks h*®
sparring for wind by the owners who have been officially
notified that no further suspension of labor conditions
will be granted. Even if it were deemed advisable to
give the mine another trial, no practical man would
suggest attempting to pump the slurry out of the old
workings, which would be just about as sensible a thing
to do as it was to provide 12001 b. stampers to pulverise the
mud. The cheapest and most expeditious way to rework
the mine vvould he to sink a new shaft. Frank Gardner
is reputed owner of the property, and now that he is
wrestling with a project to amalgamate all the mines in
the “ Golden Mile ” of Kalgoorlie, it is hardly likely that
he is going to pay much attention to a show of the
Brown’s Creek calibre.

Cabled that Sandford’sironworks at Lithgowhave
been bought by an English co. with a capital of
£750,000 another Australian industry going into
the hands of the absentee. As Sandford publicly
stated before leaving Sydney that all that he

the promoters of the project for establishing extensive
iron works on the Parramatta River were so disgusted
with the bluff and deception of N.S.W. Ministers that
they withdrew all negotiations, and are now completing
arrangements for the establishment of the works on the
Yarra.

Charters Towers returns for April: Mills 16,212

Dividends, £26,716; calls, £2633. Divs. for four months
of year, £108,233; calls, £14,066. Bonnie Dundee mine

“ formation,” and there is much speculation as to when
the reef will be struck, but, of course, no one doubts that
it will be a bonanza.

Mount Garnet: Shares selling at about 9s.
Furnaces shut down, and will stay so until mine is suffi-
ciently developed to keep them going continuously—
which some people have doubts of it ever doing. It is
three years since Mt. Garnet started, yet the depth
attained is only 150 ft. Two-thirds of the copper-mines in
Australia are closed for the same reason—failure to keep
development work well ahead. History will repeat itself
in this particular until such time as company promoters
and directors study the mines rather than the share-
market. Copper-mining, conducted on legitimate lines,
should be as much an industrial enterprise as iron manu-
facture. The man who would erect iron-furnaces and
railways and then set to work to find ore to keep them
going would be voted a lunatic.

Smith’s Creek tin (N.Q.) is Adelaide’s favorite
gambling stock just now. Slump from £l3O to £9O in
two days, with subsequent recovery to £l2O. Local paper
seriously asserts that reason for slump was that the broker
who made a market for the scrip was out of town. Stock
to be watered to an extent which suggests that original
holders must have an insatiable thirst. Bulletin’s
advices are that it is a good prospecting show, but, on
developments, present value of shares is fanciful.

Stannary Hills Tin Mine (N.Q.), during past

in several directions, and, handicapped as it is, is likely
to end in inglorious fizzle. Show owned and run by Ade-

How are the mighty fallen ! At Bendigo, in
March, 77 companies were getting gold, and only five
were on stone worth an ounce per ton. Sixty-two were
getting less than half-an-ounce, and 37 were grubbing
along for less than sdwt. Seven of them were pegging
away manfully for about ldwt. per ton. Out of the 77,
only eight scraped up a dividend during the month
And, when writer was in Bendigo, in ’Bl, the board that
was put up at the Beehive every second Saturday with
the list of dividends was about Bft. high, and it used to
be crowded sometimes, and, on dividend night, the only
sober men in the town were Alf Josephs and his partner,
Sloman. Bendigo doesn’t pay for the stockbrokers’
drinks nowadays. ♦

Rumoured that the next big Yankee trade move
will be a reach out for England’s continental coal mar-
kets. Although the U.S. output has grown in the last
30 years from 30,000,000 to 250,000,000 tons per annum}
the enormous increase has only been about enough to
supply the ever-growing demands of the home market,
and export has been comparatively neglected. Now, ’tis
said, the plans are well forward for a sudden increase of
output that will enable them to close on a lot of the
European trade that brings England so much profit at
present.

Already the over-sanguine workers find that
the N.S.W. Arbitration Act has spots on it. The miners
of Broken Hill, who under the contract system often take
home a most miserable wage, hoped for great things from
it; but the Maoriland Labor Department writes over, in
reply to a question, that the Act, in that State anyhow, is
powerless to prevent a man, or party of men, agreeing to
do a certain job at a wretchedly low rate. All it can do
is to prevent the contractors employing men at low
wages ; but that doesn’t get over the trouble, for a party
of miners on contract rarely employ anyone—a trucker
occasionally, but no one else.

John Waddington, for long Chairman of the
Great Boulder, has sent a letter to the press protesting
against “Mr. Zebina Lane’s repeated to take
the whole credit for the success of the enterprise.”
Waddington says it isn’t true, as generally supposed, that
De Rose was one of the peggers ; “he did not go to Kal-
goorlie till some time after.” “ The mine was brought to
London by O. P. Doolette, and I purchased it from him,
paying him the deposit. The only part whioh Mr. Lane
played in connection with it was in giving his report as
the mining expert, for which he was paid.” When
markets slump the public gets the news.

Late financial papers from London report rich
discoveries of banket in Portuguese territory N.W. of
Delagoa Bay. A Denver paper, sent to Australia by a
man en route to Alaska, reports the discovery of a large
lode in Montezuma which “ a strong man cannot walk
to the end of in a day ” ; value from £to loz. per ton. If
these reports are true the chance of much foreign capital
coming this way for a long time is not great, as Bull and
others will have something more attractive. This may,
perhaps, not be an unmixed evil for Australia. Poor
“ Portugoose,” though—it won’t take long for “ Brum.
Joe ” and his parasites to discover that England has a
prior claim to the country, or that a missionary has been
insulted, or some excuse will arise for annexing the
country if the goldfields are anything like the Rand. It
took a very few years for the British Government to find
that the Diamond Fields did not belong to the Orange
Free State but to a nigger named Waterboer, and almost
immediately after it had taken the fields on Waterboer 8
account it found that nigger’s title was all wrong—and
kept the Diamond Country. Probably some equally
handy nigger will turn up this time.

A report of Maoriland dredging companies

panies whose dividends exceed their nominal^capital.
Moreton Frewen, who was captivating even
when he lectured on currency reform, has given bimetal-
lism best. In 12 years the gold harvest has more than
trebled, “ and it is entirely safe to estimate that in the
coming 12 years it will again double ”; so bimetallism
has become unnecessary. But he adds that the remark-
able variation in the yield of gold knocks out the theory
that “ gold was a fore-ordained material for a money-
standard because its production fluctuated least of all.”

The ignominious defeat of Barton’s at-
tempt to raise Hopetoun’s salary another £BOOO a
year has resulted in an immediate cutting down
of exes at the big white house. Three or four
flunkeys—including the chief cook—got their sail-
ing tickets for dear old Britain. Also, the Earl
is said to have sworn a polite vice-regal oath
to spend no more than he can’t conveniently avoid
spending on pomps, vanities, and ’freshments for
the bong tong of this ungrateful country. Why
should he disburse more than his official income in
Australia when he has to “keep up” his places of
residence in Scotland and England? Echoanswers:
Why ? Australia doesn’t want the ruffled earl to
encourage snobbery on a lavish scale. It would
rather have him penurious than “popular,” in a
financial sense of the word. All the same, it objects
to any wealthy vice-regal person from abroad mak-
ing a private fuss about the alleged “ drain ”on his
unearned private increment, considering that he
would have to draw upon his own treasury for the
means of support himself wherever he might try a
change of air. Lord Hopetoun is greatly overpaid
for his Australian services. His salary, without
reckoning extras, is equal to that of the President
of the United States. His other riches are the
accident of birth. He is a spoilt child of fortune,
and, like all spoilt children, he grumbles at his
luck.

The King and the Pope are getting along
very nicely indeed. Cable: —
The King has invited the Right Rev. Robert Brindle,
Bishop-Auxiliary to Cardinal Vaughan, R.C. Archbishop
of Westminster, to bless the colors of the regiment of
Irish Guards on June 24.
Another cable: —
Pope Leo XIII. has granted the Roman Catholics of the
British Empire a dispensation from fasting and abstin-
ence on Friday and Saturday, the 27th and 28th June.
Fair tit-for-tat.. The disloyal King solicits a
“Popish ” blessing on certain of his troops, and,

pence, congratulated the Australians “on their
bravery during the war ! ” The Bulletin begins

The decision of Judge Murray in the case
of that N.S.W. military man who gave his fellow
military man a loaded cigar that nearly blew his
features off, was rather rough on an officer and a
gentleman. The judge’s Own obvious'Opinion was
that he played a silly, vulgar and cruel joke—the
gutter-kid kind of joke that a grown man should
have left behind along with his childhood—and
that in denying all explosive intentions he swore
to what was wholly untrue. All of which was
not the thing that an officer and a gentleman is
accustomed to.

N.S.W. Railway Commissioners request
passengers on Sydney trams to “destroy their
tickets, _on alighting from the cars.” The
result is that the street corners are strewn
with a litter of variegated paper-scraps, which
causes much profanity in the City Council
cleansing department. As every passenger—even
the most respectable—looks at his ticket number,
to see what sort of a eribbage or poker hand he
has, The Bulletin suggests that a solution of the
difficulty would be for the Commissioners to
establish a lottery, with weekly drawings and
prizes of value. Passengers would then hoard
their tickets, instead of strewing them about the
streets of a city which is dirty enough already.

General Hutton, farewelling the sample
soldiers sent from Victoria to take part in the
military beauty show at the Coronation, told
them that it was “ a significant coincidence that
they were departing on the anniversary of the day
on which H.R.H. the Duke of York landed in
Australia.” The Commandant discovered the
finger of Providence in this, and The Bulletin
blushes to acknowledge that it pulled its boots
on, that auspicious morning, without observing
any significant coincidence. And yet that day
twelve months the Duke of York had pulled on
his boots for the first time in Australia as Duke
of York !

The single-screw again ! The break-down
of the horse-boat Boveric, bound S’Africavvards,
may turn out a very gruesome business. The
vessel is drifting about in sub-tropical seas at the
mercy of the waves, 1500 odd miles from any-
where, with some 950 horses on board, and but 45
days’ fodder. The tale of that dumb freight may
unhappily contain more shocking and heart-
rending details than Cutcliffe Hyne put into
his story of the wrecked cattle-boat. Being such
a salvage-plum, however, it is unlikely that the
Boveric will be long without aid. The one bright
spot in the mishap so far is the putting off, when
1500 miles from land, of the first and second
officers and two men, in an open boat, in search of
aid. That the hero is possible in this day of the
notoriety-hunting crank is a joyful fact.

Maoriland railway department’s econo-
mical and happy-go-lucky system of train-running
on the unimportant branches (and very often on
the great trunk lines) has brought about another
smash, this time on the Otago Central—four
people badly injured and two trains just about
knocked to pieces. The cause of the accident was
the usual absence of check due to cheap working.
A guard and a driver received written instruc-
tions that they were to cross No. 6 down train at
Hindon. (For some reason this writer has never
been able to fathom, most drivers in these matters
trust implicitly to the guards. Writer, who spent
years in Maoriland railway service, has nevet
known a driver to read special crossing instruc-
tions; he merely wipes his hand on his pants,
signs the receipt for the instructions gingerly, and
then very carefully puts the unopened envelope
into the only clean pocket of his jacket—one
which he keeps specially for the purpose. Writer
has seen that pocket so full that some old, un-
opened instructions had to be taken out to make
room for the new ones. Then he goes oiling and
asks the guard, “What are we gawing ter do ? ”
This, however, is merely a side issue and has
nothing to do with the present case.) The train
reached Hindon, where it was supposed to cross a
train coming in the opposite direction. Here the
guard received a ’phone message that he was to
cross a train at Barewood. He thought it meant
that the original train was late and that he would
not cross it till he got to Barewood ; in reality it
referred to a second train which had to be met.
So ho pulled out of Hindon and met the first
train end on.
Maoriland, with its cheap and shoddy methods
and; its utter want of decent management and
decent appliances, is a place where it is much
healthier to walk. Coghlan publishes, in his
“Seven Colonies,” some statistics covering a
period of ten years which show that Maoriland
kills ten times as large a proportion of its passen-
gers as Victoria, Great Britain, Germany, Austria,
Belgium, Sweden, Norway, or Holland ; five
times the proportion shown by France or South
Australia ; over three times that of N.S.W., 2i
times that of Switzerland, nearly twice that of
Spain, and a larger proportion than any other
country on the list save Canada. Also, it maims
a larger proportion of its passengers than any of
these countries save Canada. In the latter direc-
tion M.L. puts up some noble records. It injures
42 times the proportion of its passengers that Nor-
way does, 21 times the proportion shown by
Sweden, and ten times the proportion of Germany,
Holland, or S.A. No person who has led an evil
life should travel in a Maoriland train—there is
no ; Bible in the carriage, and prayers are not
offered up before the train starts, as they should
be on a railway system with a record like that.
“F.C.”from
Melbourne:
I begin to have
doubts about the
efficacy of these
Missions simul-
taneous and other-
wise. Lately I en-
gaged a gentleman
in the bricklaying
industry to re-set
our oven. He ar-
rived, with a hand-
cart, about 10 a.m.
I took no particular
notice at first, but
finding he was
rushing the job
through at a tre-
mendous pace I
became interested.
Finally he informed
me that he was
hastening in order
to attend the mid-
day meeting at the
Town Hall—he said
he hadn’t missed
one since they
started and felt
they did him much
good. Iwasabashed
in the presence of
such holiness, and
highly esteemed
the honor he was
doing me in con-
senting to lay cer-
tain soulless bricks;
also I humbly gave
this walker in the
straight and nar-
row path a “ cup
of cold water ” in
the shape of a de-
cent lunch. Then
I settled up and he
departed for the
Mission, with his
hand-cart. It sub.
sequently tran-
spired he had re-
built the oven-set-
ting from a small
stack of bricks in
my own yard, and
had carted away
the remainder —in-
cluding a row
planted round the
youngster’s flower-
bed. A day or two
later I meandered
into the Town Hall
and observed my
friend lustily join-
ing in the chorus
of “ Beautiful Zion,
Built Above.”
Edging alongside,
I ventured to ob-
serve that I hoped Zion wouldn’t be built of stolen
bricks, but the virtuous bricklayer treated me as a per-
fect stranger—in fact, he even threatened to give me in
charge for insulting behaviour. As I said before, these
Missions may do good, but I have my doubts.

Sydney City Council is throwing away a
splendid opportunity of giving that filthy city a
real cleaning. After actively carrying on the work
for a couple of months with a staff of 250 men
(1000 would have been better) a tired feeling came
over the Council, and it decided that most of
the men should be dismissed, and relapsed to the
old state of inaction. It thus loses the chance,
which won’t crop up again until next plague, of
using the mild panic of the public to enforce sani-
tary conditions. Meanwhile the pest is just about
as active as ever. This sudden stop in washing
operations recalls the old story of the shearer who,
after spending years wayback without a wash,
arrived in Melbourne for the Cup and went for a
Turkish bath. An attendant, after rubbing
him down for two hours, came upon some hard
substance, which turned out to be an overcoat that
the back-blocks gentleman said he remembered
missing some years before. The shampooing
operations of Sydney City Council have only got
as far as the old overcoat. Yet Sydney arises and
goes into the cooling room to put on its other
clothes.

The dirty landlords of Sydney, together
with a few who are not dirty but only angry, have
banded together in a Defence Association to resist
the City Council’s demands for cleaning and
repairs. At the preliminary meeting, Mr. Rogal-
sky was in the chair, and Mr. Himrnelhoch sup-
ported* him cordially. Mr. Himrnelhoch, who is
something in the money-lending way, said he had
had bitter experiences lately, and possibly ’a good
many of his clients could say the same. Mr.
Rogalsky said wildly that the City Council was
“making an enormous sum of money out of the
people,” and Broughton, M.L.A., moaned that
the rates were “exceedingly heavy,” being, he
said, 2s. in the £. Broughton, M.L.A., had better
try London, where the rates are 6s. 6d. in the £,
and perhaps he will feel better. Also, under recent
English legislation, Mr. Himrnelhoch might have
some more bitter experiences.

plague cases in its hospital and three more were
suspected. But it is to be scoured asfar as possible
by the Health Commissioner. The L orth Brisbane
Council fought for months as to the size of the
garbage tins and whether the cleaning rate should
be or lfd. in the £.
In Sydney, also, the spectral visitant has
brightened up and been breaking out in new
places, but Sydney may lose its spectre when the
winter really sets in; up North it will
hang out comfortably through the cold season.
It has every facility to do so. Brisbane smells
the same all the year round. Its perfume rises
superior to times and seasons, and the river which,
loafs round it like an unwholesome brown cravat
rolls as muddily to the sea one month as another.
Twice a day the tide deposits its late_ lamented
dog on the mud flats, and twice a day it calls tor
the same. The bullock’s liver that is dropped
overboard at the meat-works drifts up to Bulimba
and looks in at the city’s back door when the tide
is rising, or drifts down. to Lytton if it is falling.
The greasy mud smells in the Bulimba reach, and
the Philp Government’s political job smells in
Queen-street, and the State’s finances smell in
London, and the odours of all these things are
marvellous.
Brisbane takes its plague philosophically.
It is a city that has lost heart. Years ago it was
young and riotous and full of broken-down
blue omnibuses and cabs whose drivers looked
like unhanged murderers. It had some energy
then; in those good old days the writer saw as
many as eight fights at Eagle Farm on race days,
observed a P.M. and a high police official both
cheating at cards in the city’s best hotel, and
threw a bottle at an Acting-Governor, said Act-
ing-Governor having damned him for not taking
his boat out of the way of a launch whereon were
the A.-G. and about a dozen politicians, half of
them drunk. And now it would be as riotous if it
could, but its credit has run out at the pub., and
it is a hot, desolate place with the frog of ages in
its throat and a half-formed impression that it
has missed the ’bus—that ’bus where the live
nations sit on the box-seat while the dead ones
miss the back step and drop off into the roadway.

A health-officer visit of inspection to the
Chinese quarters at Alexandria (Sydney) disclosed
a loathsome state of affairs, which ought to in-
terest Judge Murray, who lately went out of his
way to give a certificate of first-class citizenship
to the Chow :
The want of light and air to the dwellings, the interiors
of which were all of a more or less filthy description, was
most marked. In the tenements occupied by hawkers,
baskets containing vegetables and fruit were to be seen
lying close to a lot of rubbish, and in close proximity to
old and dirty bedding on which the residents slept. In
answer to a question as to what was to be done with these
vegetables the answer came, “ Me sell ’em you countly-
man,” meaning that they would be taken out for sale
next day.

plague under the age of 21 has not yet been satis-

Plague sufferers at Little Bay are not
debarred from receiving visits from their friends
and relations, but the nature of their illness is
kept from the patients as much as possible. One
day a visitor left a newspaper behind with one of
the sick men, who soon read his own name among
the list of plague patients. “Good God!” he
exclaimed “ we’ve got the Plague ! ” And,
much to the annoyance of the medical staff, the
whole ward suffered a relapse in consequence of

Dr. Ashburton Thompson’s health report
on Redfern did not come as a surprise to anyone
familiar with the history of that delectable Sydney
suburb (which has a population of 23,000 people,
living in 4500 houses). About 30 years ago Redfern
was a range of sand-hills ; rubbish was tipped in
the hollows of these hills. As soon as a piece was
made level enterprising landlords snapped it up,
on account of its being within easy reach of the
city, and built on it. Dr. Ashburton Thompson
reported on one Redfern area only, and by no
means the worst. Let him visit the haunt of the
Hindu and Syrian, known as Syria-town. In
that quarter the tenements are vilely insanitary,
and as many as 51 persons used to live in one
house.
Under the proud title, “ Adelaide
Will Be First,” S.A. Register (April 23)
describes with much detail a city im-
provement which is calculated to make
the eastern towns snort with envy.
Adelaide may not have pride of place in the fine
arts or the sciences, but according to the Register
it will soon be her haughty boast that she has—
“ the most handsome lavatory at any railway-
station in Australia.”

A few leprosy statistics from piebald Q.,
where the curse of Naaman is coming along
steadily. Since 1892, when the lazarettes were
established at Stradbroke Island (Dunwich, in
Moreton Bay) and Friday Island (north of Cook-
town), 96 lepers have been incarcerated. Of these
41 were Kanakas, 20 Chinese, 21 Europeans, 9
aborigines, and 5 assorted black-and-tan. Of
these 56 died, and 10 Chinese were shipped home
at great expense. Of the 56, 27 were Kanakas, 12
Europeans, 9 Chinese, and 8 assorted. Between
June, 1808, and July, 1899, 22cases were reported
—22 in 12 months ! Of these 14 were Kanakas, 5
Europeans, 2 aborigines, and 1 Chinese—and 9 of
them came from Mackay, the Q. Sugaropolis. Con-
sidering the size of the top corner of this island,
and the difficulty of catching a leper whitehanded,
so to speak, it would seem that scores of contami-
nated blacks, brindles and browns would be found
if the authorities were keen on the scent.
Naturally the Q. policeman doesn’t rush around
after the leper—especially seeing that awhile back
a leper fighting for liberty savagely bit a con-
stable with terrible consequences to the unlucky
officer. With two exceptions all the later cases
came from the sugar districts where Tommy
Tanna, Ram Sam and Ah Sin are looked upon as
being cheap and reliable. They certainly are
reliable as regards murder, lust and leprosy.
The latest addition to Q. lepers is an unfor-
tunate who, a few years back, was a giant in Q.
Civil Service and a favored invitee at all the
exclusive dinners at Government House. The
steps downward were retrenchment, poverty,
book-canvassing, Dunwich asylum, and now Leper
Island.

The proposal of Sydney Water and Sewer
age Board, that religious institutions, which are
now exempt, should pay their rates like anybody
deserves general support. More than that,
religious and charitable institutions should pay
all rates and taxes that other institutions pay, and
where they do sewing, washing, wood-chopping,
and the like for the public, they should be subject
to all the rules of the Factories Act as regards
hours of labour, ventilation, &c.—to everything
except the minimum-wage law, which it would be
impossible to enforce. Whatever aid the country
desires to give to religion or charity should be
given openly by a grant of money—not surrepti-
tiously by exemptions. The present system sub-
sidises, at the public expense, squalid little sects
and creeds that are as unpicturesque to look upon
as a corroboree, and shabby, private speculations
of the sweating and money-grubbing order like
the Salvation Army.
There is something ludicrous in the idea of the
Salvation Army being exempted from public
burdens as a charity when it ought rather to be
struck with an absentee-tax old man Booth,
whose private and exclusive money-grinding
machine it is, being a dweller in the other hemi-
sphere. The Governments which mistook Booth
for a charity evidently failed to notice that ancient
speculator’s nose, but it is not too late to repair
the oversight, and there are many similar noses in
the business which call for observation. Further,
the “charitable” lodging-house should not only
pay its rates and other public burdens, but it
should be at least made to keep itself as clean as a
merely secular beddery, and before it receives
State aid or countenance it should be ascertained
beyond a doubt that its benevolence doesn’t really
consist in supplying a dirtier bunk than usual for
a penny more. Charity covereth a multitr.de of
bugs, and when you see a text hung up on the
wall it is advisable to hit it a good hard knock.
If done properly the insect behind the text will be
killed every time.

“ Dugald ” : Crying out against the sweat-
ing of the youngster comes well from the peda-
gogue, who, to be successful under the Vic., S.A.
or W.A. Depts., must be the most remorseless of
sweaters. It isn’t the work (mainly physical) that
youngsters have to do at home that makes them
the pale, anaemic, spindle-shanked animals they
are. The successful (from Dept, point of view)
pedagogue in thisdistrict works theyoungsters from
6to hours per day at mental work, and if they
wereonly game they could tell the departmentsome
wholesome truths (concerning the system) that
might account for the awfulness of vital statistics
in years to come. The average kid can stand any
amount of light physical labor and benefit thereby,
but none is benefited by the infernal grind of 5
hours (minimum) mental activity in school,
coupled with from one to two hours home lessons
to be pored over after tea. The pedagogues
should kick their own dead horse.

Re prayers for rain. The accountant in a
Wagga bank was chaffing a Celestial about the
recent innovation of Joss, and expressed surprise
at the prompt rain which followed the Sydney
Celestial ceremonies. “Oh, yeh,” said John,
beaming blandly, “Sydney Joss all li’; eountlee
Joss not so goo’. Clistian Joss no goo’at all.; .
Look here,” excitedly; “ ’sposem Clistians bet.

ON HOSPITAL SATURDAY.
This is the German gentleman who called on pa.
A Vic. warrior specially famous for his
command of langwidge, has told his Kharki
minions what he said to one of the discontented
Fifth Contingenters. The‘rebel,’ it seems, had
the audacity to expect that the warrior would
approve of his views re certain British officahs,
but the gallant Colonel undeceived him on this
point by roaring. “If I had been there you
should have dug your own grave, and then I
would have shot you like the cur you are ! ”
Whereat the Kharki audience' cheered vehe-
mently. The notion of a man preparing his
own place of burial previous to being polished off
for insubordination seemed to appeal to the
noblest instincts of their military natures.

Nearly three months ago, a bear horribly
mauled a septuagenarian attendant in its cage at
the Adelaide Zoo. The man, who was given up
for dead (the bear was shot on top of him), has
just limped out of hospital. The most unpleasant
sensation he feels now is the icy coldness of the
arm and hand which the brute chewed off. But
the doctors say that the uncanny feeling will last
only two or three months more.
BEREAVEMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Across the cliff the other night I sped,
With stealthy step I crept,
The waves wept wild their requiem for the dead,
Dear God—l have not wept!
Along the path your foot so often trod—
At last I reached the gate,
Then shudder’d back, for you beneath the sod—
What cared you were I late ?
A little breeze came whisp’ring from the sea,
Aloud I called your name—
Then breathless waited,—listened tremblingly—
But nothing stirred or came.
Only below, I heard a sea-bird call,
And heard an echo moan ;
The troubled sky her painful tears let fall,
... 1 stood alone . . . Alone!
Across the cliff I homeward turned and sped,
With stealthy step I crept,
The waves wept wild their requiem for the dead—
Dear God—l have not wept t
QUITS.
VALE!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The day like a rose
In the garden skies
To an ending grows,
Blooms red, and dies ;
And colder than stars, and as icy white,
Gleameth your sainted face this night.
The last bread broken,
The last song sung.
The last word spoken,
The last bell rung,
And away on a misty, measureless Sea
Goeth the last who was dear to me.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
„ Sydney, May 13, 1902.
Mt Dear Arini,—
Summer and Winter are holding a midway
truce. I should not be surprised if a crop of
spring poetry were raised by what some one has
called this “ golden-tissued weather.” When
Nature herself falls in young poets might well be
deceived. There is a nice crop of strawberries in
the shops, and added to the street cries of “ fish-
ho ! ” and “ wile rabbi! ”is that of “ strobberies ”
at 2s. per pound. “ Queensland ! ” you’ll say.
Not so—local gardens and no glass-houses either.
First wild flowers of the season in the streets
last Saturday ; but the big dominant chrysanthe-
mum still fills the baskets. Our ’mum-snow was
a small affair held in a small hall to a small
attendance. Splendid blooms, mind you, but
from the Town Hall, with a Governor opening the
display, to the Queen’s Hall with a group of
cynical-looking nurserymen eyeing the other
fellows’ blooms, and a group of evening-paper
reporters eyeing the catalogues, is a far cooee.
Tne growers’ subsidy has dwindled, the seasons
have been bad for the “golden hairs,” and we
have no Governor. And if we had perhaps he
would have the same dislike to opening a chrys.
show as had Gov. Brassey. “I don’t like it at
all,” he remarked to a sympathetic woman, “for
my Treasury of Poetical Quotations hasn’t a single
verse of powtry on that flowah. Now, with a
daffodil show, I’m all right. ‘ Daffodils that come
before the swallows dare,’ you know ; the rest is
easy, you know, and soon I’m walking at the
head of a queue of narcissus committeemen.”
The ingenuousness of the old Sunbeamer to admit
his possession of a book of poetical quotes !
At Rosehill races last Saturday there was a
tremendous display of tweed costumes—on men.
At these meetings the chosen vessel always pre-
dominates over the sex that St. Paul slighted
and ordered to keep its hat on in church,
in a proportion of 50 to one. None of the women
whose names are for ever in the fashion-columns
of the dailies was present, but that’s not saying
there were no well-dressed, well-looking women
there. There were numbers of both, also plenty
of women who looked like over-worked laundresses
or cooks in large, cheap boarding-houses. They
came in their working clothes, poor things, and
they came on business—punting on every race.
Since the stopping of letters to “ Tattersall’s ”
sweeps one sees more of these haggard, cheerful
women in the grandstand enclosures at the race-
meetings. Some of them are jockeys’ mothers ;
nearly all have some connection, no matter how
remote, with a racing-stable, and the five shillings
that used to go to Hobart is gambled direct on the
horse. They take their losses quite cheerfully—
the mangle is good and work plentiful; and when
their winner is coming home they stamp their
utilitarian feet and exclaim: “ That’s him!
Good boy ! —now you’ll see how I’ll look on
Sundays! ” By the way, when the winner
of the final race on Saturday was assured of
his place, a group of fashion-plate women on the
grandstand let loose most unseemly squeals of joy.
They danced and jumped out of their frocks, and
one caught the hand of a man near her, shook it
violently, and with the other thumped the ground
violently with my umbrella —to which she had
not been introduced. - )
Concerning the frocks: There was a gray one,
a fog-gray in a material like a glorified horse-
blanket. It was a frieze or a zebiline (the monks
of old might have worn such as a penance gar-
ment) with a most perfectly-cut train, which kept
a complete semi-circle on the grass instead of
bunching into a draggle-tail. Some trains, when
let go, look about as effective as if they swathed
hot bottles. The blouse was slightly Russianised
and the hat was a white felt with white and green
leaves and a roll of old-rose velvet. But now I
come to think, it was the girl under the hat and
inside the frock that gave both distinction.
Of course something was due to the dress-
maker, but this girl was tall, dark and
graceful. Her chin was held well up and
she had a proud, innocent face like the
girls Howard Pyle draws in Harper’s Mag.
Other noticeable gowns were a white panne
trimmed round the foot with ermine and guipure.
Sounds royal, but it didn’t look it. Some white
linen costumes were out, and a semi-demi evening
gown with chiffon sleeves, which were not sleeves
at all in the sense of covering. It is the exception
now to see hats worn tilted over the face. Women
have discovered that their eyes won’t stand the
effect. If you have large, candid eyes, or ox-eyes,
you are, perhaps, safe enough, but if there is any-
thing furtive or foxy or watchful or roving about
your eyes, and you wear your millinery roof sloped
forward, just notice the staring you’ll receive from
the bold, but harmless, bounder. There is more
of a moral effect in the way of wearing your hat
than the manner of carrying the rest of your out-
fit.
Forty girls who have no need to take thought
for the morrow, at least in a financial sense, con-
stituted themselves syndicate hostesses of a dance
at the Paddington Town-hall last week. Forty
girls, all young, mostly good-looking (no young,
well-cared-for, educated, healthy, well-groomed
girl can be very plain), beautifully dressed, princi-
pally in pink or white, and carrying posies of
roses—what a sight for one bashful young man !
One such of my acquaintance was there, and at
the sight of so much beauty he had a rush of
modesty to the head and heartily wished that the
old order of the solo hostess, with her frosted hair,
matronly form, expansive smile and big bouquet,
was at the door. Then, with chattering teeth and
perspiring palms, he ventured in behind a brace
of hostesses’ fathers. But presently he longed to
be 40 men or even 20, so as to be able to dance
with his collective hostess. As it was, he blun-
dered around the walls asking her mother to dance.
The mothers were there, but not in the sense of
chaperones. The Countess of Something in an
English mag., the other day, wrote: “Chaperonage
is rapidly disappearing. In another few years it
will be a thing.of the past. Girls in their first and
second season invite men to tea at fashionable city
tea-rooms, and any attempt on the man’s part to
pay for the refreshment insures his never being
asked again. These tea-rooms are beautiful in a
decorative sense, but their tea is the most awful
wash at 2s. 6d. a cup.”
An interesting engagement is that of Dr.
Ashburton Thompson, President of N.S.W.
Board of Health, to Mrs. Lilian Simpson [nie
Salomons, daughter of the Q.C., and widow of
the late G. C. Simpson, only son of Mr. Justice
Simpson). Since her widowhood Mrs. Simpson
and her three children have lived with her mother
at Woollahra. The wedding will not take place
till after the return of the bride’s father from
London. It’s a triumph to all women when one
compels the surrender of a gallant bachelor after
such prolonged enjoyment of single-blessedness.
Miss Josephine Deakin (Mrs. J. E. Scantle-
bury) gave a concert at the Stein way Hall, in
London, on April 8, to crowded audience, and
some press notices to hand are very flattering.
Amongst Miss Deakin’s contributions were—
“ When the Swallows Homeward Fly” (given
with mezzo voce effect), the “Jewel Song,” and
Allitsen’s “ Since We Parted.”
One who has returned tells a tale of a lady stay-
ing at the same hotel where the fraud Princess
Radziwill stopped. For every fraud generous
Heaven sends a fool to keep the balance even.
This lady was young and attractive, and “she
was waiting for her husband, who was to arrive
from England.” She had waited three months,
when one day she went out and returned with a
gentleman, whom she introduced as her husband,
and he registered as such. The gentleman’s
business objective was towards Kitchener’s direc-
tion, and after two days stay at the hotel he called
for .his bill. It was presented, embodied with it
“ his wife’s ” bill for the three months—£2oo. He
swore a protest, and refused to pay the lady’s
account. “What! not pay your wife’s bill?”
said the shocked landlord. The fool went to the
fraud and remonstrated: “I have only known
you two days, etc.,”and much more. “ I am very
sorry,” cooed the fraud, “but the bill must be
paid,, and it will place me in a most unpleasant
position if you do not pay it. Remember now you
registered ! ” He remembered.
A London-announced engagement that will
interest the run-holding section of Maoriland
society is that of Miss Florence Watt, daughter
of the late James Watt, of Napier, M.L., to
Frank Baden-Powell, a barrister, and brother of
the Man of Mafeking. The Watts sheep whiten
many a hill.
Australian artists are really writing their names
in the London fog, which is quite as difficult to do
as marking them in water. Longstaff (in addition
to his King’s Commission) is represented at Royal
Academy Exhibition, opened the other day, by a
portrait of Alice, daughter of Hector Macdonald,
of Melbourne, who is one of the directors of the
North Mount Lyell. The portrait shows a fair-
headed girl of about fourteen, dressed in Lincoln
Sreen. Percy Spence and Rupert Bunny also
ave pictures in the same exhibition.
The debutantes at the Adelaide Mayor’s big
ball mourn over the frigidity of Lady Hopetoun’s
hand-shake, but are in raptures concerning the
merry way in which Lord Hopetoun himself
skipped through the opening set of lancers with
them. “He might have been my brotner,” re-
marked one enthusiastic damsel.
Reported that Mr. J. C. Williamson will pro-
bably make Melbourne his head-quarters. Mrs.
M'Quade’s decision not to re-build Her Majesty’s
Theatre makes J.C.W.’s Melbourne interests
heavier than his Sydney ones. If he does go his
family will accompany him, and his town house,
“ Ithaca,” will be put on the market.
Amy Castles,, who has been drawing record
houses in Maoriland, will be back in Sydney on
22nd. She takes a day’s rest and sings on 24th
and 26th. Miss Ada Crossley will engage Dolly
Castles, Amy’s sister, for her forthcoming Aus-
tralasian tour.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ The approaching Divorce boom in Melbourne
is looked forward to with unusual eagerness by
students of domestic melodrama. There has
never before been such a large and varied
assortment of shows billed for one season ; indeed
if the Law authorities had any managerial enter-
prise they would shift the Divorce Court to the
Exhibition-building, provide an efficient orchestra,
and charge for admission. A large audience of
sporting, commercial, and Chosen people is assured
for one entertainment, in which a pretty sister of
a. well-known citizen will sue for final separa-
tion from her husband on the double plea of
habitual drunkenness, and “ leaving her without
visible means of support.” The lady’s family
connections are said to be somewhat averse to her
action, but she means business. She has one
particular grievance that should appeal to the
hearts of all maidens about to marry. Among the
vanished means of support heretofore mentioned'
are £7OO worth of wedding presents, and, although
those silver cruet stands would now be souvenirs-
of a sorrowful event, the fair petitioner mourns
the loss of them, all the same.
“Gov. Clarke’s better-half is a friendly, homely
kind of personage. She pens familiar little notes-
to ‘Dear Mrs. Jones’ and ‘Dear Mrs. Brown, 5 '
asking the favor of their company to tea on such a
date, and any members of the family who may be-
en ‘ dispoged.’ The said Mrs. Joneses are knocked
off their perches by such unexpected advances,
and go and take tea at Stonington with much
gusto. The Guv’nor brims over with the same-
spirit of brotherly love, while the smilesome Mi«»<?
Clarke raises the ire of the Naicest by being civil
to the commonest of those horrid official people.
The smart set are so porcupiney towards the dowdy
appendages of those who earn sudden fame in
Parliament and on the world’s other house-tops.
“The German Commander, closely clasping his
partner, meandered about the ‘ Rippon Lea ’ gar-
dens that Monday of the German and Jappy
shivoo, with not a care or thought beyond the
lady by his side. Easily singled out in the
gathering was Mrs. Sep. Miller, who wore,
with a cobweb woven silk lace and glace
costume, a green-ribboned hat, Venetian red
vest points, and a string of marvellous coral.
Each round of coral was as large as a
pigeon’s egg. This is the latest supplement to a
regular cave of fine gems. Mrs. Miller is a worry
to her admiring circle. She is dainty, graceful,
petite, but she persists in drooping her head
shyly, and sidling along anyhow. She lacks an
‘ air.’ Other women assume it, who have neither
figure nor any kind of attractiveness. Ladv
Hutton, who bothers about all the Naicest, while
her frowning hubbie lurks disconsolate in the
background, was at this function. Her gown was
black, and faultless in style and fit. Aide Browning
is learning the A B C of Diplomacy and Discipline.
At this affair, he left the giddy flutterers of the
smart set and went off for a tece-a-tete with Lady
O’Loghlen—that proud matron who despises the
mushroom rich with a nostril-curling disdain.
There is nothing more invulnerable in Smell-
bourne than Lady O’Loghlen’s haughtiness.
“The Sargoods made a brave show at the
wedding of their daughter, Winifred, with Dr.
Rupert Hornabrook, on Saturday. The bride is
the daughter of the first Lady Sargood, but step-
mamma did things as nobly (she always has done
so) for her as she would do for her own daughter,
Charlotte —a pretty, gazelle-eyed charmer. Dr.
Hornabrook looks a young, pale-faced, fair-haired,
naice young man, of short stature and martial re-
putation. In India and Africa he made a record for
neat work with the lancet. Now he plies that in-
strument in Holy Adelaide. St. George’s Church,
St. Kilda, never was so decorated for any previous
knot-tying. Ribbons by the hundred, flowers by the
gross, and palms by the score, helped to deck out
the edifice to a highly festive degree. The bride
had for a wedding-gown whatever richness and
style accrue from the heaviest of ivory satin,
point lace, chiffon frilling, and tucking. The
veil and coronet counted to the credit side of smart-
ness. The four attendant maids —Miss Charlotte
Sargood the most fetching—were tricked forth in
sweet little frocks of cream with a dressing of
blue; pancake toques in cream and blue follow-
ing suit. A bid had been made for simplicity.
Assisting the parson was Dr. Be van, his
white curls making a round moon of his head,
and his voice rolling round the corners of the
church in slow, rich, theatrical tones. A little
black skull-cap covered his crown. The guests
were Mr. Justice Hodges (who afterwards made
the most memorable wedding speech of the
season) and sundry Federal and State members,
smart sassiety, and the solid class of rich mer-
chants and other magnates of commerce.
“Merchants are moving off their daughters
like winter blankets. No class likes making such
a splash as these Knights of the Garter and
monarchs of self-raising flour. The other week it
was merchant Harper’s daughter. Last Wednes-
day it was merchant George Bruce’s fourth
cherub; on Saturday, merchant Sargood’s third
daughter. In a few weeks or so hence it will be
merchant Robert Reid’s daughter, to say nothing
of his son. It is a peculiar weakness of the
‘Trade’to make a kind of front-window display
of house decorations and chiffons over the hy-
menal sacrifice.
“ Miss Irene Bruce, whose knot-tying was the
flutter of the week, was wedded to a very youthful-
looking son of Aid. Davey (who figured as a
widower-bridegroom himself not so long ago). The
ceremony came off with a full flourish of trum-
pets at Christ Church, St. Kilda, and the con-
tinuation shivoo at ‘ Brooklawn,’ St. Kilda. Miss
Ida Bruce and Miss Winnie Davey were helps to
the bride. Miss Davey,—an extra-chic charmer —
is engaged to Lieut. G. Bruce, back unbruised
from the battlefield.
“ Colonel Tom Price had been very crusty about
that engagement of his, and whenever the an-
nouncement of it appeared a contradiction was
elicited. His friends never alluded to it, and
although some pleasant innuendo was made on the
subject at his own daughter’s wedding months
ago, the gay widower ignored it. And one woman
kept the secret, and in spite of dress-builders,
hat-riggers, and caterers knowing the facts, not a
rumor of the date of the wedding leaked out before
the eventful day. On last Thursday week the
fact was first made public, when the marriage of
the Colonel to Miss Emmeline Shadforth Reid,.
eldest daughter of the late Mr. Robert Dyce Reid,
had already been accomplished at the St. Alban’s
Church, Armadale. The honeymoon, spent at
Ballarat, was brief. Military duties called the
Colonel back promptly to the barracks, where
the bridal trip was never even whispered of.
“ Melba’s good-nature is no fiction. Even the
Armstrongs, who boast the doughtiest crest of any
of the alleged Family Tree slips in this part of the
globe, own to it. Some of the she-Armstrongs
wear massive gold rings with ‘ Melba ’ raised in
diamond chips. The diva’s former hubbie and
son are in Texas —a most united pair. The Arm-
strongs here aver that Melba thought her long-
ago spouse much nearer to the title than he was—
being four removed. Certain secrets have been
leaking out of late. In the first place, Melba is
no stunning frocker —her appearance, despite rich
gowning-, is commonplace. A Collins-st. medico,

Ex-Gov Beauchamp is presenting a por-
trait of King Edward to N.S.W. National
Gallery, and has commissioned John Longstaff to
paint it; the King has promised to sit after the
Coronation. Lord Beauchamp keenly appreciated
Longstaff’s work—and so, for the matter of that,
did the British Academy’s late President, Sir
Frederick Leighton, a great artist and a discern-
ing personage quite unaddicted to gush.
Talk about provincialism. Thus a Sydney
paper:—
That, with all due deference to Mr. Longstaff’s ability,
a New South Wales artist now in London, painter or
sculptor, could have been obtained by Earl Beauchamp
for his gift to the (N.S.W. National) Art Gallery.
Now, the Earl decided to give a portrait of the
King to the Gallery, and you can’t quarrel with
the man who pays the piper calling the tune; you
must not look a gift horse in the mouth. And
what “N.S.W. artist now in London” (or else-
where) could paint a portrait to compare with
Longstaff’s work?

aged 81, died within a few hours of each other,

Alfred Deakin has attained the Acting-

25 years at the Bar, and 23 in active politics. He

Not generally known that Harry Morant
was rejected by a certain N.S.W. amateur military
potentate for the “ Citizens’Bushmen ” because
he couldn’t ride; when the potentate was told
that the rejected one was the famous “ Breaker ”
he graciously reconsidered his decision, and
applicant was condescendingly informed to that
effect. Morant’s reply was brief and character-
istic.
Died last week, Albert Lee Tucker, who
was an alderman for nine years, and a member of
Vic. Parliament for 24 years, during 21 of which
he represented Eitzroy. He was for three years
(1883-1886) a humble and hard-working member of
a Ministry run by an almost forgotten wine-
merchant named James Service, with Gillies,
Deakin, Berry, and Sargood among his colleagues.

The most defeated man in Australia,
easily beating Sydney’s J. G. Griffin, is J. Z.
Sellar, of Adelaide, who for 45 years has been
fighting seats, with two municipal wins so far to
his credit. Sellar was a Chartist who made
money at “ the diggings ” and has been spending
it cautiously ever since in building political plat-
forms 20 years in front of the crowd. This Par-
liamentary election, carrying the Labor vote, he
went down for the city division.
Lady Hodgson, whose death is reported from
England, was a daughter of the late Chief-Justice
Dowling, and was born in Woolloomooloo, Sydney.
Arthur Hodgson, an intimate acquaintance of the
Dowlings, led the van in the pastoral settlement of
Queensland. As soon as he had got up a weather-
board humpy on the Darling Downs he voyaged
to Sydney and married Miss Dowling. She was
as fond of adventure as he. The Queensland run
quickly brought them wealth. Lady Hodgson
was for some time the only white woman in the
squatting line in Queensland.
David James, for some years past South
Australia’s most successful racehorse owner, has

Wooroora. A teamster and station-contractor, he
had the dazzling luck to be working on a job near
Broken Hill when Rasp, the boundary-rider, put
in the pegs of his “tin-mine” (anyhow, Rasp
thought it was tin); and afterwards he had either
the good luck or the good sense to hang on to the
interest that he reluctantly took. One way and
another a lot of Broken Hill money has gone in
horses—through St. Albans Wilson (Broken
Hill’s early manager), Kenneth Brodribb, Philip
Charley, James, and others.

Probably there will be a thanking of
God for “Captain Cook, who dis-
covered Australia.” And so the last
Kurnell function is of no more note
than an ordinary church-service. But
how strange that Cook’s mate, Cap-
tain Clarke, never gets a word in
edgeways! Clarke commanded the
second ship of the expedition, and
when Cook was killed for coming back
with a sick ship and using up the
peope’s gods for firewood, Clarke
took charge, and went away to com-
plete the real work of the voyage if
possible. Cold and hardship slew him
■Up north of Saghalien, and no man
wrote his epitaph. His real life would
have made better reading than
Cook’s, for Clarke was not a moral
man. Two bi ts about him are amongst
the old papers still, characteristic and
quaint. Cook wondered why he was
late joining. He explained : “ I can’t
speak to the minute. The infernal
Israelites hot foot in my wake, I must
shake them off somehow and then
decamp without tuck of drum.”
Whereat, doubtless, Cook wondered;
but not so much as did austerely
proper Sir Joseph Banks, when down
on the corner of a long letter he found
the following: “Excse ppr Sr Jsp.
It was gilt-edged, I assure you ;
but the damned cockroaches ! ”
The rest is unquotable. A hard case
this Clarke, but seemingly good grit
ana staunch right through. Pity
there’s so little of him left.
The booming by Melbourne
press of the Vic. “ Reform agitation ”
has resulted in the simple folk of that
obscure hamlet, Kyabram, getting a
big advt. The agitation started with
a resolution passed at the village in
Nov. last, and this has been magnified
into the “Kyabram platform,” and
the humble local folk into the “Kya-
bram pioneers.” The only person-
ality among these “pioneers” is one
B. G. Goddard, whose boast is that
a letter to “B. G., Northern Vic-
toria,” would find him. A quaint
habit of his is to ignore, in conversa-
tion, the first personal pronoun. His
end of a colloquy would go thusly :
“B. G. came down this morning.”
“ Yes, B. G. finds it pretty warm.”
“Eh ? B. G. isn’t sure.” “ Oh, yes.
Jones told B. G. so.” “No, thanks;
B. G. doesn’t drink.” Already, a
grandfather B. G. has lately ventured
on the sea of matrimony again. He is Kyabram’s
storekeeper.
Rev. Dr. Rentoul, the interesting and
combative president of the Melbourne Peace and

that the early Christian professions of the Sunday-

joined another church (which is much the same
thing as going to hell direct), and one has taken
to drink, whereas the two lost lambs of yore
are now professors in Presbyterian theological
colleges. The reverend battler seems to have no
misgivings about the future of those two. It is
only the sinner who has never tasted the joys of
theology who can be happy in the thought that
he took to drink instead.
Tas. Mercury Davies, C.M.G., etc.,
bustled very hard for a Coronation trip to London
as Commandant of the Bisley rifle team. When
the Labor Party refused to let Mr. Barton vote
£2000 to send out the team, a less exceptionally
ordinary man than Davies, C.M.G., would have
given up the idea in despair. But Mr. Davies
rose to the occasion, squatted on every door-mat
in the Commonwealth, and by sheer energy and
bustle has got his trip and his team and his funds.
A well-advertised Southern leader-writer
is said to be negotiating with the pro-
moters of the mooted new Sydney paper
for the editorship, and should get it, too, if
the M'Eacharn influence counts for anything and
if the paper ever comes to light. Of late the jour-
nal which he is credited with the desire to leave
has seen nearly the whole of its leading men
drift away in search of new pastures, and the
trouble seems to be that there are very few front-
rank pressmen anxious to take their places.
Mr. W. Darcy Uhr, to The Bulletin,
from Coolgardie : —
Credit to whom credit is due ! I am told that Mr.
Carnegie lately stated to you that Mr. Latour was the
first man who crossed from Queensland to Port Darwin.
I wish to state that in March, 1872, 1 left Burketown,
Gulf of Carpentaria, with 105 head of fat cattle and 133
horses ; Mr. Rowland Edkins (now of Mt. Cornish), a very
old and respected magistrate of Q., saw me across the
Nicholson River, which is six miles west of Burketown.
My party consisted of six men and myself. I made a
most successful trip, losing only one horse and no cattle ;
and I was the first, by very many months, to cross the
continent. Mr. Todd, the present S.A. Postmaster, can
certify to this. If Carnegie, or anyone else, can prove
that any man crossed before me I will give £50 to any
charitable institution you may name.
As to the early life of Harry Morant (“ The
Breaker ”), some interesting circumstances (which
seem to have all the marks of truth) have been un-
earthed by Charters Towers Miner. According
to Mr. David Green, that paper, Morant arrived
in N.Q. in 1884, and in April of that year was mar-
ried at Charters Towers (though not exactly in the
name of Morant). He gave his age up there at 21,
and the place of birth not as Devon. The
Bulletin forwarded to Mr. Green a copy of
Morant’s signature, and, in return, received a
tracing of the signature in the marriage register.
There can be no reasonable doubt that the hand-
writing in each case is the same. Shortly after
this marriage Morant went to Hughenden, then to
Esmeralda Station, then to Winton and finally to
Cloncurry, doing odd jobs the while as a news-
paper writer, drover, etc. All the while he
spoke of rich relations in England ; from
Hughenden once he cabled to a titled per-
son for a large sum —he didn’t get the
money. But the fact that he spent a good
deal on the cable would seem to indicate that he
had some hope of “raising the wind” in that
quarter. Whilst in Charters Towers, it is alleged,
“The Breaker ” purchased two horses, giving in
payment a cheque signed “Morant” which was
dishonored afterwards. This is said to be the first
occasion on which he used the name “ Morant.”
The owner of a Melbourne alleged
funny paper has been conspicuous
on the “Simultaneous Mission
platforms right through the Yan-
kee fanatical outburst. The Geilful
gang hail his presence with joy, but
it is really wnao
anyone given to
reading PauNOH
would expect.
When Moody and
' Sankey first struck
London, androunded
up great mobs of rab-
bit-brained pietists, a
wicked penman took to
printing a loose-moralled
periodical labelled the
Moody and Sankey Humbug.
The constant attendance at the
revivalist variety turns, for the
purpose of poking borak at the
cute couple from Amurrika,
was too much for him, and one
day he handed in his resignation
to Satan and became a disciple of
M. and S. The Humbug had
fone the way of all good papers.
’robably the whole thing was a
lovely advt. engineered by two
workers for the Lord, but the con-
verted editor was a trump card.
Three years ago Miss Amy
Castles was so pleasingly unsophis-
ticated that she was unable to
appreciate the significance of lavish
newspaper criticisms. _ After one
of her early concerts in Melb., a
well-known musical critic ■wrote a
most glowing eulogium. The powers
that were behind Miss Amy worked
themselves into a perfect fever of
delight. They instructed the young singer that
she was to be introduced to the great critic that
evening, and she must thank him most cordially
for his splendid notice. The introduction took
place, and little Amy did not forget her orders.
“I must thank you, Mr. Thunderer,” she said,
“ for what you have done about my advertise-
ment.” “What was that?” asked the critic> in
amazement. “.I don’t know,’’_was the candid
reply ; “ but Father Robinson said I was to thank
you for it.”
The late “Johnny” Wallace, the Vic-
torian mining enterpriser, who assisted his private
investments by speculating with his children s
“Monaghan estate” moneys, what time
sole trustee of the property, seems to have “ cut
up” fairly well, though not nearly the millionaire
he was supposed to be. The old man left £6350
realty and £115,000 personality. His widow and
children get large annuities, and the residue, if
any, goes to the charities of the country districts
where he loomed largest when in the flesh.
There is not in Melbourne a more correct
man than Waxellency Madden. He practically
never makes mistakes —except when pronouncing
legal decisions. But, the other evening, at the in-
augural meeting of the University extension move-
ment, he stated, not once, but several times, that
the extension lecturers received £2 6s. Bd. for each
lecture, as they gave six for .£2O. The reporters
scribbled away, and, so staunch was their faith in
their Chief Justice, that the calculation appeared
that way the following day in both dailies.
The United Typewriter and Supplies Cos.,
one of the largest concerns manufacturing type-
writers, seems to be getting more of its share of
the world’s business. One of its machines, the
“Yost,” was favoured recently by the Indian
Government with an order for one hundred and
twenty machines. In addition to this their
Australian representative now reports the sale of
five hundred “ New Century ” Typewriters for use
on the Government Railways. An' important
fact is that these two are record orders for the
world, and, what is more important in the eyes of
the Company, were obtained in competition with
all the leading makes. Australian buyers can
obtain both of these machines from the Company 1 *
office in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.*

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, chant me a lay of the days of old;
Of the days when men were brave—
When they loved the strife that brought no gold.
No fief, but a hero’s grave;
When a woman’s love was a noble prize
But not for a woman’s sake ;
When a kiss, and a glance of a leman’s eyes,
Were on show for a Man to take.
I would ask no star of a woman’s love,
No star of a man’s regard ;
I would ask no aid from a Hand above,
Nor for mercy always barred.
The puling snivel of weak-kneed fools
Is a smirch on our ancient race !
By Man ! If this be the fruit of the schools.
Give me straight what they call Disgrace.
For ’tis good to die as a strong man dies,
E’en though by the hangman’s rop<3;
For nothing on earth so currishly cries
As the cry of a poltroon hope.
I will do as I will—as a strong man should :
I will reck when the reckoning comes ;
Then march me to doom in the haltered wood.
Or brave the Rogue’s March of the drums.

Certain recent alleged arson cases round-
aboutly recall the good old days, when Bendigo’s
male population adjourned so largely to the
Barrier:
Hubby in most cases left his wife and youngsters in
Eossession of house—the same being insured—which he
ad built on mining-occupation lease. Houses being
then a glut in Bendigo, there began a remarkable series
of fires, invariably taking place when all connected with
the scene of the bonfire were in evidence at one of the big
Bendigo stores, surrounded by friends to swear an alibi,
in case of trouble. The insurance co’s at last refused to
pay cash, offering, instead, to re-build to the value to
which property was insured. There were no more fires.
One cause of fire was alleged to be this : Before leaving,
an ordinary and easily-lreakable lamp was placed on the
table, tied to it being a few yards of string, having at the
other end the family cat. Then the door was locked, the
rest being left to Providence and the family “ Tom.”
Many a cat was burned in those days to provide a Bendi-
goniau bean-feast.
“Brumby” : A lame laughing-jackass of
mine opened my eyes witli a jerk, t’other day, by
his capacity for holding rat-meat. Poked a rodent
out of a hole in the ceiling, and as he fell Jacky
met him half-way, and had him bolted before you
could say “Great O’Sullivan ! ” Repeated opera-
tion a few minutes later with another rat, which
was as promptly “ scoffed ” by Jack, although he
couldn’t spring to iner t it as before, the weight of
his first victim probably telling on him. Both
rats seemed almost as big as the bird himself.
The back-blocks do not mono-
polise all the women who do men’s work. Saw a
woman t’other day working a team of horses with
a roller on a cultivated field between Ballarat,
and Geelong (Vic.), about 10 miles from latter
village. Meanwhile the train was picking up
men at each station to go over to S’Africa and
burn Boer farms—also being worked by female
hands ! What is this earth coming to ?

Everyone from Warren to Brewarrina knows the
cause, which is this: When pigs became a pest
several years ago a shilling apiece was paid for
their scalps— ears meant “scalps.” Ergo, to stun
the pig, young or old, and slash off the ears was
all the pig-hunters wished to do, and did with a
vengeance. Hence the hundreds of earless pigs
found on the Lower Macquarie. Messrs. Hill,
Clark, and Co. alone paid for 1600 pig-scalps in
one year on Batterbone. — H. J. M ‘Cooky.

For years the collection of the Maori dog-
tax has been a strain on the resources of Maori-
land. Mostly it has been collected by an over-
whelming force of constabulary armed with rifles.
Sometimes a whole district has been gaoled till
the Maoris tired of the confinement, or the Pake-
has of keepiiig them in idleness —generally the
latter. In Gisborne district they have solved the
problem. _ There a Maori Council looks after
Maori affairs and receives a subsidy. The Govt,
struck an estimate of what the dog-tax should
yield, deducted it from the subsidy, and told the
Council to collect the dog-money and keep it.
Then the Council armed itself with an axe and
went round stealthily, seized the dog by the ears,
and demanded instant payment on pain of
butchering the precious mongrel right there.
The Maoris fumed, said “Ouwee!” and other
things, but they paid promptly, and now the
Council sits smiling while it looks at a bank
receipt for £3OO dog-tax collected in one week,
which is a record. It only killed 18 dogs in the
collecting process, too.

“L.C.” : Re swaggies as pedlars
(8., 5/4/’O2). Met a man selling cheap sheet-
music the other day, arid had a talk with
him. Said he had only just tried it. He
invested ss. in Melbourne, and in one day,
wayback, disposed of his stock at a profit of
nineteen shillings —not bad work. He is
not a swaggie now. He travels per rail
and puts up at the best pub.

The dignity of the law, as interpre-
ted by the Vic. country J.P. A swagraan
was recently convicted of larceny, and the
Bench gave him two months. “What?”
cried the swaggy, glaring at the court,
“ two months ! All right, I’ll make it warm
for you when I come out.” As the ser-
geant started to remove the prisoner, the
paR Jaypee called in quavering accents,
“Wait a bit. One month.” The sergeant
hustled prisoner away before he could say
anything further; but, on getting out-
side, swaggy said reproachfully: “You’re
a dead nark, you are. If you’d a-given
me time to bluff him a bit more I’d ha’ got
a quid out of the poor-box afore I’d
finished.”

A Chinese cabbage-man, charged
at Christchurch (M.L.) with turning a
comer too quickly, didn’t “savee,” but
stalked up to the Bench and handed in
his summons, wrapped in which were two
£l-notes. Then he rushed for the door,
but was detained. He continued not to
“ savee,” fearing the Bench would ask for
more. But it only cost him 17s. in all, and
when given back 235., a look of utter in-
credulity crossed his features. He couldn’t
understand the two mandarins not accept-
ing a pound each—it struck him as uncanny
—for in China the more money you give
the Bench, the more justice you get. So,
with a yell, he banged the 235. at their
Worships, and bolted.
Two wild whites killed two other whites
out at the back of Queensland lately, and tried to
burn the bodies; and ever since (quite rightly)
about a score of police have been hunting them.
But how many police are hunting the other white
who is believed to have lately potted two Aus-
tralian blacks in the Kimberley district, Westralia
—their charred bodies have been found—and who
made tracks, it is supposed, into the N. Terri-
tory? What has the Westralian Protector of
Aborigines done about it?* The official view of
the relations between blacks and whites up there
was pretty well indicated, t’other day, when a
white, committed for attempted murder, was let
out on small bail.

“Pelican”: Seeing, recently, one of the
worst blackguards and blacklegs of the Australian
turf behaving in a most kind and considerate way
to a not too-robust traveller by rail, I said to a
“ book ” : “ Blank has got some good in him, after
all.” “No fear!’’was the reply; “the infernal
scoundrel thinks it will bring him luck out on the
course! ”
A SLAVE OF SENTIMENT.
“ As a gentleman, is that the bare truth?”
“Pardon me! no gentleman would dream of tell-
ing the naked truth to a lady.”
“ Meera ” : Re horses pulling by their
tails. The practice is, no doubt, cruel in most
cases, and with a heavy load. But I have heard
of instances in which stockmen, finding cattle
bogged, and having no harness at hand, have
hitched a stock horse to the bogged beast by the
tail, and the horse has pulled the beast out with-
out apparent discomfort, although considerable
strength had to be used.

A letter to Dungog (N.S. W.) Chronicle :
I notice a challenge from Mr. W. J. Yates to pull with
his bay stallion Mr. R. Tickle’s black horse for £2O aside,
to pull the heaviest load on level ground, the furthest of
three pulls. I cannot understand how a man can be so
stupid as to force a horse, or allow him to pull a load
until he is able to go no further. Only an ignoramus
would do it. If I could put a heavy load on Mr. Yates’
back and get behind him with my whip and flog him along
until he was compelled to drop, then I’ve no doubt he
would think himself badly treated. If we respect men
why not respect the horse? —Yours, etc., J. HANDCOUK.

“Myall,” concerning
a certain pea - striken
horse:
“D.H.R.” (B. 19/4/’O2) re-
commends hand-feeding as a
possible remedy for the effects
of Darling pea. Two years ago
I unsuspectingly bought a
useful-looking nag cheap, as I
thought. Shortly after the
purchase he frequently dis-
played an ardent desire to
walk in mid-air and perform
various other impossible cir-
cus-tricks. During one such
exhibition a seedy-looking in-
dividual emerged from the
small expectant crowd which
had congregated on the pub.
corner and remarked : “Lor’s-
truth he’s got the pea. Yer
want to stable-feed him for
awhile, Mister, and he’ll be
orlright.” The wise coun-
sellor was of the decided
“ horsey ” type, and I took
his advice. When half a ton
of chaff and a proportionate
amount of grain had been con-
sumed,’and the animal’s eccen-
tric manners had apparently
vanished, I began to belaud
the efficacy of the seedy man’s
remedy. But early one morn-
ing I was awakened by a
great commotion in the back
yard, and just got out in
time to see the stable door
collapse and the gee-gee
emerge with an erratic slip
and elevated cranium. He
scrambled through a couple of
fences, and made an effort to
climb my neighbor’s chimney,
getting a hoof hopelessly
fastened in the aperture ’twixfc
the bricks and the wood-
work. The chimney threat-
ened to collapse, and the
neighbor talked fight [and
litigation. A new chimney
would have cost six or seven
pounds, so when the town
constable arrived at the scene
of excitement, I arranged for
the disposal of the ill-starred
neddy with a revolver-bullet.
The hand-feeding remedy cost
me i'B for. fodder, 7s. for re-
pairs to my neighbor’s chimney, and 10s. for removing
the carcase of the defunct. Therefore, although it
may be possible to cure a pea-stricken horse by such
means, I am strongly of opinion that the result is too
uncertain and the experiment too expensive.

While deepening a well at Derby (Vic.)
a workman discovered two large black snakes, at a
depth of 60ft., embedded in soil that (so far as is
known) had never been previously disturbed.
Both snakes were alive and wriggling.
“ Echo ” sends a
mining story:
It was when I
was engaged driv-
ing in the No. 6
level at the Mad
Ox mine. Only
Ted Stretton and
myself, besides a
trucker, used to
work on that level,
except when an
extra trucker was
put down for a
couple of hours.
There were two
undeveloped levels
below us, and
about 250 ft. of
shaft. A raw new
chum came to
work on Hanley’s
shift. Hanley’s
was the shift that
used to relieve ns.
he was a big, silly, soft sort of
fellow named Mitchell, and he
was a subject sent especially
for the amusement of McKillop,
the trucker. McKillop devised
the glorious plan of playing - a
huge ghost joke on him. Ac-
cordingly, the hour of changing
shifts one day found McKillop
ready wai-ing for the cage to come
down with Mitchell in it. Three
successive days he waited, and on the
fourth day Mitchell descended alone. He
stepped out of the cage, hung his billy on the
nail at the plat, and knocked “one.” The cage
flew up the shaft, and Mitchell turned round, his hand
on the open shaft-door. McKillop stepped out from
the darkness of the drive, about 20ft. away, an awful
apparition. Mitchell caught sight of him—l think he
said two words, “ Good God ! ” and staggered back. His
feet caught on the truck-rails right close to the shaft, and
he tripped and went down from sight—2soft. I rushed
to the knocker and signalled for the cage. McKillop was
prostrated by the shock. We ripped his simple ghost-
gear off, and hid it in an old drive. The cage arrived and
Stretton and I descended. Mitchell was quite dead when
we found him. He looked very peaceful—-not a mark on
his face, strangely enough. McKillop came up—“ Just
the shock of seeing the poor fellow go down you know.”
Nobody breathed anything about ghosts. At the inquest
we suppressed the truth manfully, and McKillop’s"spectre
was buried in oblivion. 1 met his mother next day, the
bonniest old Scotch face and the prettiest accent in the
world. “ Aye, Mr. Jackson ye mind, the Lord he hale
gi’en, and the Lord he lia’e taken awa’ ; puir laddie, he
was aye the onlucky bairn of the hnose, but it’s aye hard;
ye ken, on his ain auld inither.” “ It's aye hard,” she hi ut-
tered again. McKillop died 15 years ago. He took t 6
drink, and in the horrors he fell down imaginary shafts in
his mind till the shock killed him.

T. C. Williams, one of Maonland’s wealthy
men, is a great believer in feeding sheep on'gorse
where grass is scarce, and has put his theories into
practice on his property in Auckland district, with
good results. The gor.se is the seedless variety,
and the sheep are turned in when the plants are
green and tender. In three years’ time they
become tough and uneatable.

Horse and driver were complete wrecks, latter

“Haneer”: Is “ Akenehi ”
altogether right in speaking of
the Maoris as exceedingly brutal
fighters? My great uncle, who

while he was lying in agony the
cfiief, Te-ore-ore, chivalrously ex-
posing himself to the fire of both

Edwin Arnold, a pleasant British
versifier, who seems to be developing an
unexpected vein of humor in his old
age, nas been advising Australia, from
12,000 miles away, to cultivate the
prickly pear for the purpose of raising
the cochineal insect. There’s any quantity
of prickly pear scattered over Aus-
tralia already, but the kind that accom-
modates the cochineal insect is a special
one, and Arnold thinks the mallee
farmer should introduce it and see how
things pan out. If it doesn’t pan out
anything to speak of, the industry can
be forthwith dropped, and presumably
the m.f. will then be able to besiege
the Government for money to help him
get rid of too much prickly. And the
far-away poet would have a niche in
the same temple as the men who first
introduced the rabbit and the sparrow
and the thistle to an ill-used country.

to be slaughtered. Cheerful, too, was

man. A piece of white, hot metal fleyv
from under the hammer, penetrated his

A GENUINE CASE.
BEAT: “'Sense me, Guvnor, I’m not arstin’ for
money, but I’m starving. Couldn’t yer take
me down to lunch with yer?”
Fe the mysterious origin of fires. About
last Christmas a serious outbreak occurred at the
railway offices, Eveleigh, Sydney; but most
searching inquiry failed to throw any light on the
origin of the blaze further than that it came from
a heap of waste paper and oil-rags lying in a corner
of one of the rooms. For experiment a similar
heap was placed in the corner and watched. Soon
after, fire broke out again—showing the arsonist to
be the sun, which, blazing overhead at mid-day,
shone through a window that acted as a burning-
glass.
Can a Man be Young at Seventy-Three?
After the prime of life do increasing years
always mean a decline of physical strength ?
Does it never happen that in this fight, against
Nature’s law, man is able to pose for a time as the
winner? _ .
The problem is as old as mankind ; a Wmgelah
settler’s story (says a local paper) is only the
latest expression of it. Old age and increasing
infirmity seemed to have set their seal upon Mr.
William Shearer, of Wingelah, Cate Creek,
Brewarrina. During his early life lie suffered
many hardships, and whilst in Queensland,
thirty-seven years ago, took fever, from the after-
effects of which, until three years ago, when lie
was made hale and sound by the famous Dr.
Williams’ pink pills for pale people, he continued
to suffer. Indeed, at seventy-three years of age
the old gentleman is as healthy as possible,
declaring that he feels as well as he did when a
youngster. The interesting story of his rejuvena-
tion (writes an interviewer) was unfolded to me
the other day.
“I came from England to Melbourne in 1853,”
said he. “Twelve years later I went overland
on horseback to the Gulf of Carpentaria, a
distance of 1800 miles, living a life of hardship all
the time. Whilst there the heat was especially
severe ; I took fever, and until lately have never
been free from its after-effects. My body and
limbs were partly paralysed so that at times I
could not mount a horse or move about quickly.
I was thin and debilitated, and lost all appetite.
Medical treatment failed to benefit me.”
“ How long did this continue ? ”
“Until about three years ago, when a friend
writing from Scotland advised me to try Dr.
Williams’ pink pills for pale people. I did so,
and after taking the contents of one box I felt
.greatly improved, my blood began to circulate
properly, and I became stronger. Several more
boxes cured me. Since then I can mount a
horse with ease, work actively, and ride twenty
,qr thirty miles every day. I have recommended
Dr. Williams’ pink pills to scores of sufferers,
many of whom have derived great benefit from
their use.”
Lots of men (and women, too) who are not as
old. as Mr. Shearer, would yet like to be a little
younger, and the rejuvenating_ effects of Dr.
Williams’ pink pills are often' mentioned by
those who have used them.
They are known to have cured a number of
critical illnesses, most of which, indeed, are
only aggravations of a lack of “tone” in the
nerves ,or a watery or vitiated blood. Dr.
Williams’ pink pills for pale people (see that
Dr. Williams’ name is on the box) have cured
nervous exhaustion, paralysis, premature decay
of the powers, consumption, ansemia, biliousness,
indigestion, St. Vitus’ dance, nervous exhaustion,
&c. They are sold at two and nine by chemists
and storekeepers, or, if not readily obtained
without question, they can always be had, post
free, from the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co.,
Queen’s Place, Sydney. Nervous and anaemic
sufferers are earnestly warned against medicines
which act upon the bowels; they are particularly
dangerous. Dr. Williams’ pink pills are not a
purgative; on the contrary, they purify and
enrich the blood and tone up the nerves, so that
risks ,of infection by the bubonic plague are
avoided.


*distributing kitchen.
A committee meeting of the proposed dis-
tributing kitchen was held yesterday after-
noon at The Block, Collins-street. It was
unanimously decided that the scheme was a
workable one, and means were considered
to ensure the establishment of such an in-
stitution. eaef)
street furnishes ten customers* the result
would be, for* one. meal, a day, 4850 orders,
this estimate of customers is a remarkably
low one, and as. the motor cars can deliver
-oo meals per hour, the prospects of public
support are very hopeful? As has before-
been stated, the food boxes can keen -the
iood either hot or cold for three hours' The •
■advantages of concentration in Lond#i are
with Jhflh a,!l hced here by the rapidity
with winch it is possible to travel owing toa
mqeh less congested condition of the traffic.

VICTORIANA


Lord Beauchamp has commissioned John 'Long-
Btaflf to paint a portrait of Kiflg Edward VII. for
' presentation to N.S.W. National Art Gallery.
Artist : “Full length, your Majesty 'I ”
King Ed. : " Well, in art, you know, the great thing is to knots what
to leave out. I think we might leave out all below this."
PERSONAL.
Captain Wallington states that the
Governor-General is making certain
reductions in his establishment, and is
sending some of his horses and servants
home. —Daily paper.
Our artist does not go in for pathos, as a
rule, but the picture of a Commonwealth
Governor stopping in bed pending the
reconstruction of his only pair, strikes
the imagination forcibly: The Govern-
ment really ought to have raised this
young man's screw.
BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS.
m l fcer f ? r ® du< » tion Penry has determined to withdraw the ABOO
subsidy unless the two local art societies amalgamate within a month.
The above picture is to some extent allegorical, and altogether prophetic.
STATESMEN IN SEARCH
OF A CAPITAL.
*' When the party reached a
particularly pretty spot, they
entered a paddock, and dined
sumptuously off tinned meat
and pickles, and washed the
combination down with hilly
tea.” —Daily paper.
Am OMUKMgEKo Yokhl : “ Look ’ere, Bill, it’s my ’pinion there’s

RUPTURED.
Dr. W. S. Bice, the well-known New York Hernia
Specialist, sends a trial of his famous method FBEE
TO ALL. Anyone can now cure themselves at
home without pain, danger, operation, or an hour’s
loss of TIME FBOM WOBK.
At the earnest request of British patrons, Dr, Bice
has opened Branch Offices at 9d Stonecutter St-,
London, E.C., and to the thousands upon thousands
of ruptured people who are torturing themselves
with bad trusses, and are in momentary danger of
death from strangulation, will send free to all a
trial of his famous method that has saved So many
lives and made so many men, women, and children
well and strong and permanently cured of bad Bup-
tures. Do not be backward about writing for the
FBEE TBIAL. It will cost you nothing,, and will
enable you to see how easily you can cure yourself
in a short time without losing an hour irom Work.
Dr. Bice is determined that every suffering man or
woman shall know the wonderful truth thatßupture
can be cured, and he therefore generously sends,
prepaid by post, his method absolutely free, and you
can make a trial of it. Bemember that it is the
same method that Mr. Thomas Blay (whose picture
is given below) used ; and who can deny the truth
when it is put before them in so clear a light ? It
must indeed, be welcome words to the afflicted.

WORDS OF PRAISE FROM Mr. BLAY.
No. 5, Ripley Terrace, Luddenden Foot,
W. S. Rice. April, 6,1901.
Dear Sir, —After using your treatment for three
months I find myself cured of my Rupture, at the
age of 55. I had been ruptured for ten years.
I shall advise ail people afflicted with this com-
plaint to use your treatment, as I know from
experience that it will cure permanently. You must
have a wonderful knowledge of rupture to Atone
so perfectly without seeing the rupture.
I am in good health now, something I have not
enjoyed for ten years before. You can use this
letter in any way you choose, and I hope it will
guide others to a perfect cure. —Yours truly,
T. BLAY.
There is absolutely no question about the curative
ability of this combined and perfected method. It
has stood the test of time; it has been through the Are
of critical cases ; it has come out victorious in every
curable instance. It has saved the child to a life of
independence; it has given the youth his natural
endowment of health and strength to Aghtthe battle
of life successfully; it has conquered the blight upon
old age and turned years of suffering into ending
days of joy and giadness. Whoever is Ruptured, or
knows a person offering with Rupture, should keep
in mind the fact that in eighty per cent, of all cases
there is a daily liability that before night they may
say good-bye to earthly things. Does not this fact
influence one to pau e and consider whether they
are using their best efforts in the way a wise Creator
intended they should? And if the forethought,the
research, and the painstaking effort of one who
invents and studies for the relef of others is placed
in our hands, is it not our duty to read and listen
patiently, that we may take advantage of that which
contributes to our earthly beneAt?

POLITICAL
POINTS
Kyabram reform mainly means putting a
oheap ass in the place of a good horse.
The rather far-away billet of surveyor of
the Federal capital is already exciting sharp rival-
ries in the States.
The Adelaide papers cut down the honorific
titles of Federal members to “Sr.” and “Rp.”
It is short and business-like, bub there is a certain
wildness about “ Sr. Higgs ” and “Rp. Knox.”
It is an open secret up north that Philp
would have gone to the Coronation but for the
fear that internal strife for his billet might wreck
his Cabinet. As an alternative, ex-pounder Rut-
ledge may go and bring a bauble back.
The Kyabramapootra has a suspicious
aversion to reform of Vic. Leg. Council, the only
Second Chamber in the world which has an abso-'
lute veto on all popular legislation, the only one
which can be neither dissolved, ignored, nor
swamped.
Tasmania is locally governed by 102 road
trusts, 33 cemetery trusts, 21 municipalities, 19
town boards, 15 water trusts, seven marine boards,
six rabbit boards, and some fruit boards and
main road boards. Some of the municipalities
refuse to levy any rates
at all and let things sfide,
and one of them last year col-
lected a total income of £1
12s. Id. A Government which
carefully parcelled the island
out into districts, and placed
one looal authority in charge
of each, making it council and
road, water, cemetery, rabbit,
marine and fruit board all in
one, might do some good.
THE WORD OF PROMISE.
JONES: “Hello, writin ’! What
are you writin’ for? ”
SMITH (who is perming a proposal of
marriage): “ For posterity !”
Dear Bulletin. —For brazen cheek, it
would be hard to beat the Sydney morning dailies.
It isn’t generally known, but I intend it shall be,
that all the time the D.T. and Herald have been
shrieking for economy their officials have been
simply wearing out Premier See’s door-mat endea-
vouring to bull-doze him into granting £2500 a;
year of public money to pay the Railway Com-
missioners to run special early morning trains, to
take their papers free into the country. I have
myself stumbled across them in the Premier’s
aute-room twice in the last fortnight. I don’t
know if Mr. See has any intention of granting
their preposterous demand, but I am inclined to
think, from the attitude of these papers towards
his Govt., he has bumped it out.— Arthur
Griffith, 9/5/’O2.
S.A. democrats, not too cheerful at the
result of S. A. elections, were quite cheered by the
defeat of Von Doussa, the politician who engineered
the unspeakable Snow Tram Grab through S.A.
Parliament. Strange to say, it was this that
killed him, for Von Doussa’s country constituents
reckoned that abolition of the present trams
would rob them of their market for horseflesh !
Barton’s studied vagueness and elusiveness
in recent speeches begin to disgust even his most
ardent admirers. Some of his recent deliverances
are almost cryptic. Barton’s figure leads us to
expect robustness and plain speaking ; the disap-
pointment at his anaemic futilities is on a par with
that when a great robust Italian, whom you sur-
mise is a basso profundo, turns out to sing with a
piping treble.
The new S.A. Constitution Act reduces
the Assembly from 54 to 42. Only four of the old
members gave it up (and one of those four was
dead), so that eight had to be thrown out. And
the State, while it was about it, threw out eight
more in favor of new men. The Leg. Council
drops from 24 to 18. Four old members stood
out, and only one new man came in, so that only
three had to be forcibly ejected.
“ A disappointed political boss requires
the services of a handy Premier. Must be
vigorous, yet servile ; rigid, yet pliant; a strongly
democratic Tory, intensely economical while
spending large suras of money, an independent
time-serving weathercock of fixed principles, and
a stem and upright groveller. Religious infidel
preferred. Will be thrown aside when done with.

South Australia still follows the policy of
supporting strong men, irrespective of the views
they hold ; the policy which enabled her to send
to the Federal Convention, and afterwards to the
Federal Parliament, such a good, if mixed, team.
The one district of Torrens has just returned to
the local Assembly (as was freely foretold) the
Premier, the head of the Opposition, and the
leader of the Labor party i
A commentary on the change in the nature
of things at Sydney Town Hall was furnished by
the episode of the Mayor (Thomas Hughes) being
served with a notice, signed by himself, to carry
out certain structural alterations in some proper-
ties he owns, or in default prosecution would
ensue. In the old days, to have interfered with a
mayor’s or an alderman’s property, or that of an
influential friend of a mayor or alderman, would
have meant early, if not instant, dismissal of the
official concerned. It is said that the person most
delighted at the discovery of the change is Mayor
Hughes himself. It was Hughes who started to
break down the rotten old system by exposing the
officials who allowed one high personage’s rates to
run into arrears, and another high personage to
alter the assessment on a friend’s property.
The Federal Electoral Bill pro-
bably embodies the simplest and most
democratic electoral law in the world.
Every adult man or woman who is
sane, out of gaol, has put in six months
residence in any part of the Common-
wealth and is a natural-born or natu-
ralised subject can have one vote for
both Senate and House of Represen-
tatives, and only one. Also no person
who has a vote for a State legislature
to be debarred, by any reading of the
Federal law, from having a vote for
both Federal Houses also. The under-
lying trouble is that, apparently, every
British Hindu or Singapore or Hong
Kong Chow who comes here can claim
a vote as a British subject—which is a
further solid reason why they should
not come here.
Melbourne Age pegs away vigor-
ously, but with little intelligence, at
its “ Parliamentary reform and re-
trenchment ” campaign. Its usual
process is to shake its arms in the air
and say, as in its leading article of 29th
April: “ What sense is there in a little
State like Victoria employing an army
of 30,000 public servants?” It looks
awful enough, no doubt. But if police,
railway officials, school teachers, and
other sundries were called public ser-
vants in England that country would
have more public servants in propor-
tion to population than Victoria has.
So would many other countries. No
doubt the Vic. public service can stand
reduction, but all the same it is already
no larger than the average. The Age
should reason instead of whirling
like a maniac. It is not the want of re-
trenchment nearly so much as the
want of a bigger revenue, and the
right application of it, that is the trouble in
Victoria, and a bigger land-tax is one way to get
that revenue.
“Kiwi,” of Maoriland, takes his solemn
oath about this:
A paragraph is being published in the press here that
Trenwith, the Labor member of the Jingo Victorian
Cabinet, is about to offer a boon to working-men by
Introducing a Bill to enable them to make their homes
inalienable. On paper, the thing looks beautiful, but it
may interest the Vic. working-man to know that we have
had such a measure on the statute-book in Maoriland
since 1895—“ The Family Homes Protection Act.” It
originated with our great, benevolent, but “ faddy ”
Stout, and, when before the House, many columns of talk
took place about “ free homes.” The Act enables anyone
who is out of debt to make his home, to the extent of
£l5OO, inalienable for all time. But, though it has been just
seven years on the statute-book, not a single home has
been “ protected ” under it. Our statesmen had better
leave off such slipshod experiments, and try their hands
at enabling the great mass of men to get homes.
Westralian Arbitration Court, the Chief
Justice presiding, has settled its first wage-dispute
by cutting the child in two. The most important
part of the proceedings was the Court’s ruling-out
of the lawyer, though here again it cut the child
in halves by letting the lawyer’s managing-clerk
in.
The agitation in favor of reduction of
members of N.S.W. Leg. Assembly, without
regard to any other reduction, may be interpreted
by the fact that almost all who originated the cry
were either not known when payment of members
was under public discussion, or were pronounced
antagonists to that Radical measure.
Maoriland Liberal press begins to show
signs of bartering its white blood for a Japanese
meat-trade. It is proposed that now “we are
allied with Japan,” although the coolie should be
prohibited, the trader should not be discriminated
against—in the interests of frozen meat. How
the over-running of M.L. by a horde of Jap. shop-
keepers and hawkers is going to assist an export-
trade of frozen meat to Japan is very hard to see.
The Melbourne law-students’ monthly, the
Summons, for May, contains an article on the
Marais court-martial case, recently decided by
the Privy Council in a manner which has shocked
constitutional legal opinion in England. The
article in question is evidently by a skilled hand
in constitutional analysis, and hints that if the
Privy Council is right many trite chapters in the
English constitution will have to be re-written.
An interjector at a Kew (Vic.) reduction
of members meeting concentrated much food for
thought, and sobered the whirling reducer visibly
with, “ Why not reduce them to one ? ” Reduc-
tion may have its charms, but the historic savour
of the number of the Decemvirs, or the Council of
Ten, or even of the Thirty Tyrants, to say nothing
of the one-horse plan where the solitary legislator
would be called a Czar or a Sultan, is not exactly
sweet. Besides you can’t bribe a big legislature.
Jenkinson, ex-leader of the Queensland
Remnant, is out of Parliament, and his organ
Progress, has just published its last issue. Pro-
gress thus summarises its own career :
Progress opened as a red-hot Opposition organ, de-
veloped into a Ministerialist, and then somersaulted back
to the Opposition. It was everything by turns, and no-
thing long ; and the public do not trust a political light-
ning-change artist.”
A touching death-bed confession.
There is strong evidence that the first
victims of the coming financial “cold snap” in
N.S.W. will be the old-age pensioners. Sugges-
tions from various quarters, that the relatives of
pensioners should be compelled to contribute to
the allowance granted, and that “ a careful test
as to character” should be made, indicate just
such a movement as that which, in Victoria, has
degraded the pension scheme to the level of a cold
and grumbling charity.
ONE FLAG, ONE FLEET, ONE THRONE, ONE
BOSS, ONE FATE.
Oaptain Pursey Chirnside, M.L.A., told
his Victorian constituents that he accepted the
Kyabram programme (46 members lor Leg.
Assembly) and also “ believed in civil servants
having a vote of their own, and returning, say,
one or two members.” Certainly, why not? In a
House of 46, public servants, 2 members; publi-
cans, 2; cold-teaites, 2; tote supporters, 3;
bookies, 2, and so forth ; and for the squatters a
whole House all to their own cheek, as at present.
The ungrammatical Pursey has brilliant ideas at
times.
In the Commonwealth Senate a Pulsford bird sat
Singing “ Tariff! low tariff 1 no tariff 1 ”
And I said to him, “ Pulsford bird, what are you at
Singing ‘ Tariff ? low tariff 1 no tariff! ’
Don’t Australia want an incentive to grow?
Don’t Australians need any favor and show?"
But he only replied, “ It is D.T., you know,
Singing ‘ Tariff? low tariff! no tariff!’ ”
A country correspondent :
Editor Bulletin.— N.S.W. Parliament will do well to
keep wide awake when transactions under the Closer
Settlement Act come up. Around several country towns
there is a tendency towards “ syndicating ” small worn-
out holdings with a view to offering them to Govt, as a
big estate of considerable value. Now, the spirit of the
Act is clearly to “ burst up ” large estates—to make com-
fortable homes for 20 or 30 families where one, a few sheep
and many rabbits previously subsisted, not to simply swap
owners. A Minister might be cajoled by a persistent
representative of Smith’s Curse to put a “liberal”
interpretation on the Act, so Parliament needs to' be
careful.
When the revolution took place in Maori-
land the struggle was between the pawn-com-
panies and land-sharks on one side, and organised
labor (including both brain and manual laborers)
on the other, and the first-named went under.
Now another fight is impending, between organ-
ised labor and the organised cockatoo—a most
grasping, soulless sweater, who sweats the life and
brain out of even his own children. The Cookies’
Union numbers 25,000, but that only represents
about one-third of the Cocky voting-power, at the
very least. *
According to Kir wan, M.H.R., women
postal officials at Kalgoorlie, Coolgardie and
Boulder City (W.A.) are, in some cases, paid only
£7O a year, and women employed in the telephone
service even less. If so it is soulless sweating: a
woman simply can't live decently and keep herself
bathed and clothed in clean linen on £7O a year
on the Westralian goldfields. And an Australian
Government shouldn’t put itself in the position of
cutting down a fair supply of food and tubs to its
women employees.
The Federal Government proposes offer-
ing £324,000 in bonuses to encourage the produc-
tion of iron and steel (£250,000), galvanised iron,
wire netting, &o. (£50,000), spelter (£20,000),
reapers and binders (£4000). The bonus system,
combined with Protection, has already been tried
in Australia, and has proved eminently successful:
the Sydney Freetrade newspapers, protected
under the free-postage system, and liberally
bonused by special trains and other concessions,
have grown to be very large and profitable
properties. Under these circumstances, the
Federal Govt, is walking on a well-trodden path
with the light of a Targe and patriotic precedent
to guide it.
Barton’s job in London will be rendered
more difficult by the presence of Seddon. Barton
cannot, in view of his Melbourne banquet speech,
pledge himself to Imperial Federation, Imperial
defence, or preferential trade. Seddon will be
there, ready to bid for popularity against all
comers, as he did in 1897. He will be petted and
caressed, and held up as a shining example—and
reported, there’s the rub!—and his Jingo gush
will be contrasted with Barton’s reserve, because
the latter cannot pledge his Commonwealth with
the assured recklessness of King Dick of Maori--
land. The contrast between Seddon’s expansive-
ness and Barton’s caution will be so great that ere
long Barton will come to be looked on in London
as a kind of a traitor, although Australians know
him as a decided Jingo.

A PIANOLA in the Home.
ITS PRACTICAL USB.
Does the Cost of the Pianola bring enough pleasure
in return to warrant the investment ?
THE Pianola will enable every owner of a piano to play
upon his own piano whenever he desires. Not only
this, but every member of the family can also play upon it—
not one or two pieces, but practically every composition ever
written for the piano.
Did you ever stop to consider how much pleasure there is
stored up in your piano ? Have you counted the number of
times in a month it is used, aside from the tedious practice
of a child ? Perhaps you or some member of your family
“plays a little,” but the difference between playing a little
and playing everything you wish is considerable. It is
worth thinking about. The Pianola supplies the deficiency.
It even makes no difference if you do not know one note
from another.
The fingers of the Pianola rest upon the piano-keys, and
strike the notes for you just as they are printed on the
music sheet.
You experience all the pleasure of playing, because you
control the expression, which is the soul of music. Your
mood or taste enters into, and gives a distinct individuality
to the rendition. It is this which gives the Pianola its
fascination to the musically critical, and caused Paderewski
to endorse it. It is this human element, permitting a musi-
cal result in the true sense of the word, which has caused
Paderewski, Sauer and Rosenthal to have Pianolas in their
own homes. The repertory of these great pianists is
limited to twenty-five or fifty compositions which they can
play in concert form at any one time. They are glad to
have it increased by the Pianola, and to be able to play
without troubling with the notes.
With the Pianola you can play every style and class of
music ever composed—Liszt Rhapsodies, Chopin’s Noc-
turnes. the grand operas of Wagner and Verdi, light operas
of Sullivan and De Koven, and all the latest popular
favourites. In fact, with the aid of a Pianola you can play
upon your piano any selection you wish, you can have dance
music or song accompaniments, and the question of finding
“some one to play ” need never arise.
It may be purchased on the hire system if desired. Send
for Catalogue.
The Pianola is the only piano-player endorsed
by musicians of note.

Jenkins Iscariot had his reward at the
S.A. elections. Among the five members for
Torrens, he crawled in a bad third. Among the
three members for Flinders, Minister Foster got
third place. Minister Gordon got fourth place
among the four members for the Southern District.
Treasurer Butler was the luckiest; Barossa
returns three members, and he got the second
position. Such a unanimous crawling-in of
Ministers at the tail-end of things has
seldom been seen. The Tory leaders, both
in Council and Assembly, topped the poll,
and the Jenkins Iscariots didn’t score one first
place among them. Only an alliance with the
Labor party or the Tories can keep Jenkins in
office now, but the Labor party won’t look at his
new policy, and the Tories have come back so
strong that they may reckon they can do without
Jenkins.

CALLAGHAN & SON,

The suggestion of a Mr. Goodchap, of
Sydney, that Premier Barton shall take a hand at
the actual Coronation of the King will give the
performing Archbishop a shock —if he hears of the
weird idea. A spheroid of gold with H.M.’s
dominions beyond the seas marked thereon in
gold or Royal red enamel, so runs the scheme —
and the spheroid aforesaid is to be placed on
Edward’s crown by Mr. Barton just before the
swearing-in ceremony. Mr. Goodchap forgets
Mr. Seddon, who would naturally desire to add
his little emblem to the pile. A spheroid of
greenstone with M.L. in a bas-relief of kauri gum.
Why not ?
The Sydney Technical College scandal
makes no visible progress towards clearing up.
Months ago it was understood the Public Service
Board had handed over the whole business to
Attorney-General Wise, as some of the financial
transactions alleged were too serious for even the
almighty Board to deal with. Since then nothing
has been heard. The P.S.B. knows nothing, the
Minister for Education, whose department is very
much discredited by the whole business, knows
nothing. All of which ignorance is most remark-
able. Either certain officials in the Mining
section of the Technical College were guilty of
gross corruption, or are much maligned, and it is
due to them and the public that they should have
a chance of clearing their characters in fair, open
trial. The present inaction is calculated to make
the public think—lots of things on the subject of
corruption.

“ "Veteran,” to The Bulletin :—
Why not tell the story of the “ ease somewhat akin" to
Morant’s referred to (B. 3/5/*2) as having occurred at
Delhi. The officer in question was Hodson, and the
affair ruined him. If some of the staff on the spot, in-
cluding a late Field-Marshal, had had their way he would
have beeen hanged. He murdered not two but four sons
of the old King, and he did it with his own hand. No
other prisoners were killed—none were taken except the
old King; his family, and half-a-dozen other important
personages. Delhi, a city of nearly 200,000 people, wasn’t
at all like a S’Alrican village. An army little over 20,000
strong could not venture to play any monkey-tricks in
such a place with its narrow streets and stolidly-built
houses, every one of which was a potential fortress. It
took nearly a fortnight after the place was entered to
occupy it even in name. On the day after the place was
entered, old Wilson, -the General in command, con-
sidered the situation so dangerous that he actually
wanted to withdraw, and only the energetic protests of
his chief engineer, Smith, Neville Chamberlain, and
Henry Norman made him change his mind. Hodson’s
murderous folly made the situation more dangerous. The
four men he shot could themselves have done no harm,
but their murder caused much discontent among the
native cavalry, who were nearly all Mohammedans, includ-
ing Hodson’s own regiment, which got into such a state
that he had to be removed for his own safety. That was
the second occasion on which his violent and brutal
temper got him into trouble. He was never employed
again, and narrowly escaped the gallows.

THERE ARE MANY REASONS why we pose before the public of Australasia as the Leading
Pathologists and Medical Experts of the Day. One of them is because w.e do more
practical good and create more permanent physical benefit than any other association of
medical men in Australasia. We are not bound down by any specified rule, our views and our
principles are as wide as the Continent over which we practice. Our systems, methods,
practices are new; there is no room for obsoletism in an Institution whose patients are
as the sands uoon the sea-shore.
EMINENT PHYSIOLOGISTS from the World a scientific lahorator th 9 our new
source of Life. It is the creative and snsta.ning element in all a be effectual the system
methods prove that Electricity can be applied judiciously, onu t and remarUab i e change

disorders are remedied, the nerves strengthened, the circ

Remarkable Results from
Remarkable Persons.
WE CAN OFFER PROOFS that will convince everyone
that our new systems of ELECTROPATHY, or the judicious
use of Electricity and Medicine, will cure certain classes of
disease which tiie medical faculty has signally failed to relieve.
Facts are stubborn things. Men like Mr. Joseph Megson,
Champion Cyclist of N.S. Wales; Mr. J. Johns, Champion
Light-weight Pugilist of Australia ; Mr. Rd. Cavill, Champion
Swimmer of Australia, and holder of many World’s Records,
together with many other well-known professionals in the spheres
of Sport, Art, and Music, would not say the ELECTRO-
MEDICAL TREATMENT did them incalculable good if it did not.
But we have given them “ nerve power and strength, of which
they have despaired.” The copies of their original Testi-
monials will be posted to any person for perusal. The
Specialists of the FREEMAN and WALLACE Institute assures
anyone of long suffering that they will ensure a new physical
Change in them by a few weeks adoption of their new treatment.
Specialities.
Diseases which will yield readily to the Electro-Medical treat-
ment are Indigestion, Dyspepsia, Sciatica, Nervous Heart
Troubles, Epileptic Affecticns, Lumbago and Rheumatism.
If you suffer from any of these try an “ Invigorator” with our
medicines. You will be cured.
Don’t Miss this Medical Work.
Everyone in New South Wales who have sent One Shilling In
Stamps to the Specialists for their new work, “ Clinical Experi-
ences,” are surprised at its usefulness. It is worth a pound a
page bo persons living in the far country parts. It contains 550
pages of medical literature, 150 full and half-page medical illustra-
tions, and contains 31 chapters on various diseases, epidemics,
their growths and treatment. Love and Marriage, Fevers,
Plague, Sunstroke, Burns and Scalds, Insomnia, Piles, Dropsy,
Asthma, Diabetes, Snakebite and Cure, Fractures, Broken Limbs,
Wounds, etc., etc., are treated exhaustively. One Shilling in
stamps posts it free to any address. Its literature is clear, concise
and useful, its illustrations graphic and entertaining.

FOR THE I LIVER.

S</
The present is the season of the year,
with its sudden cold changes, when influenza,
bronchitis, asthma and toothache germs get in
their fine work. Oh ! the joyful toothache ! The
best way to fight off these persistent intruders is
to fortify the human system with occasional
“ contingents ” of a good, reliable whisky like
D C.L. _ The medical faculty almost unanimously
concur in their advice. No one who has once
tried D.C.L. can doubt it to be the very best
stimulant for such work—or any other. D.C.L.,
the Whisky of the Wise.*
Mr. James Forsyth, M.L.A., writes to
point out that his majority for Carpentaria (Q.)
was “not 8, but 8 times 8 ” (re B. par., 10/5/’O2).
A Victim to Files.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills Effect His
Escape.
“For the past twelve months I have been a
sufferer from piles,” states Mr. Charles Morrison
who resides at 72 Webb-street, Fitzroy, Vic!
“ 1 was under several doctors during that period,"
but received no permanent cure. A friend of
mine one day, in the course of conversation
advised me to give your Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills a trial, which I did, and I am very happy to
he able to say they have made a thorough cure of
me. I might state that I had only taken three
bottles in all. The first two or three doses gave
me relief. You are at liberty to make what use
you like of this, as it may be the means of helping
other sufferers. ” •
Straight as an Arrow.
A Family Cured.
Truthful words are like well-armed arrows;
they are straight and pointed, and fly true to
the mark. There is no fooling about the truth,
it always strikes home, and this is how the words
written by Mrs. W. Clarkson, Enmore, N.S.W.
make such a deep impression on everybody "who
reads them. She writes Myself and family
have been cured of biliousness and liver ailments
by using Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills. I can
also state that they are superior to all kinds of
tonics for the hot and muggy weather that we
experience in New South Wales.” Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills are a perfect blood purifier, and
a positive cure for biliousness, indigestion,’ con-
stipation, headaches, sallow complexion, liver and
kidney troubles, piles, pimples, boils and blotches,
and for female ailments. Sold by chemists and
storekeepers, Is. per bottle, or six bottles

name blown thereon.*

SPORTING NOTIONS.
S.A.J.C. meet ended Saturday. Money
(£13,512) put through the machine wag £669 ahead of
same day last year. Caledonia went out red-hot for
Fisher Stakes (15 starters) but failed to get a drum. He
had the steadier of 10.10 up, conceding over 4st. each to
winner (Lome) and second (Clifton), and 2.3 to third
(Annotate)—a big contract. Lome was so little fancied
that his backers secured a dividend of close to £62 Flag-
ship (unlucky in the Cup) annexed S.A.J.O. Handicap
cantering.
* * * *
Fifteen starters for Adelaide Cup, Amiral
being the only malcontent. Flagship was nearly 2to 1
more favored than second fancy, The Idler; Footbolt,
third, was a shade less in demand. Adelaide and Lome
made the early running. At the 6fur. Footbolt, who had
been showing prominently, dropped right back. The
favorite came from the rear to fourth place at the home
turn, where The Idler got to the front and stayed there,
winning comfortably from The Victory, who finished
well, with Flagship third. Footbolt travelled very fast at
the finish. The lm. sfur. was cut out in 2.61 J. Footbolt
ana Flagship were unlucky, and Flagship’s rider alleged
foul work against L. Kuhn (on Nitre) but stewards, on
the question of premeditation, gave Kuhn the benefit of
the doubt. Amount invested on the winner totalled
£4930, which provided a div. of £5 12s.
* * * *
The Idler was got by Far Niente from the
Goldsbrough mare Waiting, at Hobartville (N.S.W.). At
yearling ssles he fell to bookmaker Barney Allen for
65gs. Said that stable netted £3OOO through The Idler’s
success. Present ownership is something of a mystery, for
when he won at Moonee Valley (Vic.) a protest alleged
misstatement and omission in entry,” under a rule which
demands that if bookmaker or trainer have an interest in
a, nag he shall be raced in the names of all concerned.
Though their ruling might have affected The Idler’s
Adelaide Cup engagement, the Moonee Valley stewards
haven’t, so far as is known, yet investigated the objection
—which inaction smells somewhat.
* * * .
The first Adelaide Cup, in ’64, was worth more
to the winner than the present race, there being a sweep-
stake of £5O each among the 12 starters, and £5OO added.
But an owner can start to day for £8 in all, and the stake
is £BOO. Explanation —the Jockey Club can always rely
on getting something well over £lOOO out of the totalisator
commission during the afternoon. In other words, the
public finds the money instead of the owners.

Positano colt Milano, on the strength of sur-
prising track work, topped the market in Rosehill 2yr.
old race Saturday and again sent punters up badly.
Fractious at the barrier, some broken gear necessitated a
return to the paddock, and then, though jumping away
well, he did no good. Scarlet Runner got a great go and
headed the field of 14 home, but was lucky to beat Kelso’s
Mrs. Grundy as, following upon a bad run, that filly came
out wide at the end and, streaking up, only lost by half a
length. Scarlet Runner was bred by Mr. C. McPhillamy
and got by Haut Brion from White Rose; she is there-
fore half sister to Tecoma who shaped so disappointingly
among the galloways. The promising Mrs. Grundy is by
Wallace from Duenna, and consequently related to
Amberite, Pelissier, Flintlock and Acetine. She still
belongs to her breeder—Mr. John Lee—who leased her
to Kelso at yearling sales last season for all two and
three year old engagements, the consideration being £lOO.
* * * *
Much-waited-for and watched Transvaal looked
to have a cut, judged by betting operations, for Granville
Stakes, but shaped poorly. Rush to “ get on ” bewil-
dered Mo for a while, and once the nag was at 2’s ; but
The Jester won in a canter, pulling up with Hazel Lad
second, and Neptunus third. At Canterbury a fortnight
before, Transvaal, after being made particularly hot by a
misguided public, fell back to almost any price, and in
the actual race seemed to own the situation if he wanted
to. On certain deductions from little happenings
attendant upon working the “commish.”, this scribe
purposes speculating another crown when things seem
within Transvaal’s scope. '
* * » .
The .Jester, winner of itosehill Granville Stakes,
Saturday, is a five-year-old gelding got by Antaeus,
and is an up-country performer of note. Backed down
to 5 to 2, he was sent out a hot favorite in a field of 22,
and, humping 8.6, won easily from flag-fall to judge’s
stand. At Forbes (N.S.W.), recently, War Cloud, with
41b. less, beat The Jester, and on the second day he went
under to Merralie in the Cup, the latter carrying Ist. 101 b.
more. After his manner of gathering in Granville Stakes,
R.vdalmere Mile looked “good goods” for The
Jester, and money was showered on him till nothing
better than 7 to 4 could be had ; then he fell as flat as he
rose brilliantly before, which caused some hard thinking.
Finish of the struggle was stirring. Fanfare, apparently
hopelessly out of the hunt ere turning for home, bounded
up and pipped the money on the post. Certainly not
more than heads separated the first four.
* * * •
Mr. H. C. White’s big disappointment, Tatter-
wallop, by Clan Stuart from Tatters (Old Clo’s dam), col-
lapsed, apparently paralysed in the hind quarters, at
Randwick, Saturday, and was destroyed. Tatterwallop
carried a lot of money in S.T.O. Hurdles, previous week,
but ran nowhere. He won Oby Hurdle Race at Caulfield
m October. Said that Tatterwallop hurt himself at last
Melb. Cup meeting, bringing a swelling in the side, which
may have had something to do with his sudden break-
down.
• • • *
Till now three two-year-olds have heaped up
£lOOO each of M.L. prize money, and two of these owe
their origin to Seaton Delaval. Stepniak colt Orloff has
won the biggest lot (£1125), Poriura (£1040) follows him,
with Idas (£1015) third on the list.
* * • *
Old-time jock., “Paddy ” Piggott, up on Melb.
Cup winners, Haricot (’74) and Chester (’77), is doing
“ riding work ” at Brisbane. T’other morning the St. Jean
colt, Wabash, unseated him, but tough old “Paddy”
escaped unhurt.

Pensioned-off Bacchus has had eight seasons at
racing, and won 19 times in 105 starts. He’ll luxuriate
in the paddocks of Yarra Glen henceforth.
* * * *
A back-blocker’s impressions of Sydney pony-
racing -“ I came to the conclusion that the starter is
the principal figure at the gathering ; he decided three of
the five races that I saw, and it was pure bad luck on his
part that he didn’t score a fourth, as he gave one horse a
break which seemed to put the remainder hopelessly out
of it, but another managed to get up at the right end
and score a neck-win. The people who attended were
there for purely business reasons, and I seemed to be the
only innocent abroad in the whole congregation. Ic was
worth the price of admission to get a glimpse of the excel-
lence to which ‘ tick-tacking ’ has attained. Half-a-dozen
experts were practising this * art ’in the paddock. The
rapidity with which they pulled their ears and noses
waved arms, extended fingers, and slapped their breasts
and the evident ease with which their pals on the flat
interpreted the movements and signalled back for further
information was a triumph of art. Coming home in the
tram half-a-dozen perfect ladies, varying in age from 25
to 60, squeezed into our compartment. They had spent
the afternoon punting. Thev claimed intimacy with
crack pony jockeys, and seemed sanguine of being able to
pick about two-thirds of the winners of all the pony races
which would be decided the following week. I feel
bound to confess that even * picnic '-race officials could
glean a lot of useful information on Sydney pony
courses."
* • • •
A jumpers’ flat-race, at Aspendale Park (Melb.),
last week, eventuated in the disqualification, for sus-
picious riding, of the jockey who rode the winner, Good
Day. The case was doubly remarkable. In the first
place, Good Day made a dead-heat of it with Nansen, and
it was not until he had won the run-off by a short neck
that jockey Short was called to account for his con-
spicuously erratic performances in both races. Onlookers
were mostly disposed to think the man guiltless of inten-
tionally bad riding, though he took the nag “all over the
shop” each time, the run-off being his masterpiece of
mismanagement. The stewards seemingly drew unfavor-
able conclusions from the betting market. Nansen
started at 6 to 4 on, whilst Good Day was friendless at 10
to 1, in a field of four.
• • • •
The Federal Postmaster-General now tempers
the wind to the shorn “ Tattersall ” by allowing the
Hobart Deputy-Postmaster to decide whether letters
posted to Mr. Adams’ address shall or shall not be de-
livered. Locally understood that Hobart Postmaster has
been instructed not to be officially aware of such letters
unless upwards of a bushel arrives in one mailbag.

The nasty little Bisley rifle team squabble in a
nutshell : N.S.W. demanded that the team should be
chosen on a basis, not of ability, but of population. It
was a miserably paltry claim. The cricket team now in
England has far more N.S.W. reps, than the population
basis would give the State ; and, though naturally disap-
pointed, the other States didn’t go crying about their
wrongs, but cheerfully agreed to the choice on the ground
of ability. N.S.W. is truly like a querulous old woman in
her Inter-State relations. She didn’t raise the population
basis issue when she got more than half the cricket team,
but “ wouldn’t play” when there seemed a danger of her
having a fraction of a Bisley rifleman less than her popu-
lation entitled her to.
* • * •
The senseless squabble about the rifle-team just
sent by the Commonwealth—or rather by certain sub-
sidised private associations within the Commonwealth
to compete for prizes at Bisley, ought to show the folly of
trusting to that sort of encouragement as a means of
training good rifle-shots for the defence of their country.
Side by side with these subsidised associations and clubs
is a system of so-called “ musketry instruction ” for the
different regiments and corps, in which each man is
expected to fire away a certain number of cartridges
every year. Last year the practice, according to the
official report, was “ unsuccessful.” “There was no im-
provement.” Nearly 20 per cent, of the men were not
exercised at all, and of those who were, 21.28 per cent
turned out “ marksmen,” 22.52 per cent, first-class, 39.96
per cent, second-class, and 16.24 per cent, third-class.
That means that one-sixth of the men could not be
depended on to hit a target twice as big as a man
placed less than 300yds from them. There are
no prizes to be won at these ordinary annual rifle-
practices, and so 20 per cent, of those who should
enter shirk them and reserve themselves for the matches
got up by the subsidised associations where they can win
something. Rifle associations don’t help to make average
men good shots. If a man can shoot well to begin with,
or finds that he improves very quickly with practice, he
will stick to it ] but the average man who is never likely
to rise above mediocrity and does not win prizes soon
drops rifle-practice for good. If the Oommonwealth
really wants a good average standard of skill, not
a few good shots and a host of very bad ones, such
as it now has, it should cease subsidising the asso-
ciations. They are only good for the few superlative
shots who divide all the prizes among them. The money
thus saved should be divided among the marksmen and
first-class shots—the good average men who cannot hope
to win matches. That would soon raise the average
shooting of the regiments to something respectable, and
make them good fighting machines, which they are not
now.

All States but Tas. were represented in eight-
oar race at Adelaide, Saturday, when five crews—a record
—competed. Victoria from the first showed superior
form and pace and left the Orow-eaters behind in the first
mde. N.S.W. popped right out after the first 200 yards ;
Q., S.A., and W.A. made things hot for each other, till
S.A. just showed in front, with Q. second, and W.A.
third. Second mile of the course (3m. 364yd5.) saw S A
make a big effort, but it had no hope. A mile from the
finish Vic. was rowing beautifully even and winning
comfortably. N.S.W. was at this stage a mere speck on
the horizon. The race was virtually between Vic., S.A.
and Q., and ended in Vic. winning Dy 20yds. from S A
who held a margin of 1£ lengths from Bananaland’s
heavy-weight combination after a gruelling last half-mile.
Westrahans were three lengths further off, fourth, and
poor old N.S.W. 200 yards away last. Time was 17 7.
• * • *
Up to date Victoria has competed in 26 inter-
state eight-oar races, won 21, been second 4 times, and
third once. N.S.W.’s count is 24 races, 4 wins, 18
seconds, one third and one last. Bananaland has taken
part in 13, won one, been second twice and third seven
times. So far neither S.A. or W.A. has succeeded once.
* * • *
At Adelaide, Saturday, Australian champion
amateur sculler Daley again qualified for the title. Only
opponent was local crack, Fahey, who was completely
outclassed. Queensland R.A. brought this feature into
existence ten years ago, and, though contested at irregu-
lar intervals, it has proved interesting occasionally.
Slack was the first winner (’92). Latest is Daley’s third
success. He didn’t compete in 1900, but squelched that
year’s winner and others a year later.

Veterans are almost afraid to suggest to the
young ’uns that visiting English teams of 15 and 17 years
ago were better stuff than the men whom Stoddart and
Maclaren captained. The idea sounds old-fashioned and
conservative. Also, it is an attempt to belittle the vic-
torious achievements of the modern Australian cham-
pions. Likewise, it is “un-English,” because it insinu-
ates that the old-country cricket has grown weak and
flabby. Nevertheless, the simple faith in those purely
professional Shaw and Shrewsbury Xl.’s of yore is based
on an undeniable strong foundation of—Shrewsbury.
The Nottingham “ crack ” has suffered much ill-health
since the time when he used to take the field in Australia,
with long Gunn, Billy Bates, and Barnes (the original
batting and bowling Barnes), Maurice Read, Flowers,
Attewell, Sherwin, Briggs and co. He can’t be
altogether the champion he was, but his per-
formance of last week showed him able to take the
measure of the best Australian bowling to-day. Arthur
Shrewsbury is the last rose of his cricketing summer
blooming alone. A slow batsman to watch, inasmuch as
he never plays riskily if he can help it, but a moderately
fast scorer. A stonewaller who gets a fair percentage of
boundary hits in a casual way. Hayward is a more showy
batsman of the Shrewsbury type when he gets set, but he-
doesn’t start with the confidence that marked the Not-
tinghamshire play when the now “ old man ” was leader
of the school. In fact, Australia, in the past dozen years,,
has seen no English bat who equalled him for “ sound-
ness ” — i.e., skill, patience, and nerve; combined—nor any
visiting Eleven that had as much cold courage in its com-
position as the Shaw-Shrewsbury teams displayed.
Seeing that Jones, J. Gunn and Jessop, the
batting failures of M’Laren’s crowd in Australia, have 1
each of them reversed their “ form ” at the first attempt
in England, it would be only natural for Mac. and Hay-
ward to reverse their “ form ” and get disposed of very
cheaply. But the brilliant success of the other returned
tourist, Braund, is rather ominous. Braund’s perform-
ance—an average of 50 runs per hour for two hours and
five minutes—suggests that the Australians can’t afford
to have Trumble invalided when a Test comes along.
• • • •
Australians made no mistake about their second
match, when, with a total of 474 to t’other side’s 287 and
183, they beat Notts by an innings and four runs. No
previous Australian XI. has done a better thing than
this, which was chiefly brought about by Darling (128),
Hopkins (80), and Armstrong, who took eight wickets for
47 runs in the finishing couple of hours. Yet Armstrong
is rated much more of a bat than a bowler. This perform-
ance is reminiscent of Bilowell’s achievement, when he
accounted for 10 Surrey wickets in one innings. Darling’s
doings so far discount the idea that he is a back-number,
and should never have been chosen.
• * * *
Present Australian Eleven will hardly whack the
same amount of coin among its members as previous teams
have done. Match with London County at the Crystal
Palace failed considerably from a “gate” point of view,
but unfavorable weather may have had much to do with
that. At Nottingham, where they ’thuse over cricket
(and this was the only occasion the Australians would
visit them), the cable man tells that the attendance was
“ only meagre."
• * • •
Ttastling premier Harry Pearce and Jack Pearn
supplied a lively maul (Graeco-Roman rules) at Perth
(W.A.), recently. Pearn, by sheer brute power, secured
the first fall in 17Jmin. Next, both rolled off the stage
amid a great uproar. Pearn was badly hurt but went on.
Things were torrid till Pearce, with a marvellous head
spin from a “ full Nelson,” flattened the big fellow out—
7frain. Third bout went to Pearce in 1.40, and, during
the fourth, which had lasted 3min. Bsec., they rolled,
tightly gripped, to the stage edge, where Pearn scraped
himself severely and refused to continue. Probably
they’ll come together again on the turf. Australia hasn’t
for years known a fiercer or better ’rastle than this, in
which science triumphed over superior force.

At individual supremacy of N.S.W. Bowling
Association, the last two in—Carrie (Petersham) and
Harrison (Ashfield) —met. Early stages saw scoring
fairly even till Harrison (with short “ heads”) went along
to 16, while Carrie stood at 8; but latter, with a spurt,
had a run to 23, while the other only accumulated 4. Harri-
son then brought his lot up to 25, with Carrie’s at 27.
Thence to the close Harrison added but one, and the game
finished 31-27. It took 36 “ ends ”to decide the match.
Carrie, to carry off the supremacy, defeated Rummell
IWaverley), Moran (City), Strong (Balmain), Young
(Ohatswood), and Lewis (Balmain).
* » » »
Final of N.S.W. bowling rink supremacy
(Saturday) went to Hale’s City four who beat Coker’s
team (also City) by 26 to 16. It is interesting that City
Club chose three rinks to represent it and paid their
expenses, but the successful combination, though coming
from the same quarter, entered entirely “on its own.”
Skipper Hale was twice champion bowler of M.L., and
three years since played third in Mr. Harris’ N.S.W.
champion four.
* * * *
Interesting light was shed on professional
cycling when Bilmartin’s trainer, Henry Gordon, sued the
“ Plugger” for £5O training exes. Plaintiff swore “that a
few weeks before the Austral Martin said it would be his
last race, and if Gordon (his trainer) kept his mouth shut
as to his intentions to win he would give him 15 per cent,
on the total of the first prize, £4OO. If plaintiff had put
a single pound on Martin, or opened his mouth, the
betting market would have been ruined, and Martin and
his friends would not have been able to win the £7OOO or
£BOOO they did.” Martin didn’t pav up and allegedly gave
as his reason : “ Yon are not entitled to anything ‘at all.
I bought the race, and had to give £3200 to win it.” It
was further alleged that Martin bought £9OOO worth of
suburban property since the race. Just as the noses of
the public were beginning to gather around the case it
was settled out of court.

Jack M'Gowan, the most business-like glove-
fighter in Australia, who has returned to Melbourne with
a bag of Sydney money, claims to make the income of “ a
professional gentleman” at the game. There being
nothing in his class in Melbourne to match him with, he
is taking on the heavier men, and undertakes to account
for Bob Fraser, the Port Melbourne slugger, on a date
fixed. “ There is no money in the business unless you
fight hard and fight often,” M‘Gowan says, “and I’d
fight horses rather than not fight at all.” M'Gowan is a
most industrious young man, and is understood to “ ’tend
Sunday-school.”

Veteran pug Abe Willis, verging on 40, will
fight Westralian Joe Dempsey in Sydney three weeks
hence. Willis was a good ’un and fought ’Murkan negro
Dixon when both were at their prime, a decade ago, in
’Frisco for the world’s 8.4 supremacy. Abe can hardly
show anything near the form of those days, though few
have looked after themselves better. Dempsey is a quiet
but vigorous youngster whose appearance belies him if
he can’t fight, but he’ll want more than brute force to

Bruisers* James and Frost, at Sydney Golden
Gate A. 0., Saturday night, made things fairly’huzz right
through six rounds. James stopped most of the thumps
but he hurled a few at Frost, and twice looked like a
winner, despite that bets of 2 to 1 were freely shouted
on Frost at the end of every round. Hair-raising rallies
were frequent, and James’ grit stood out often, but his
stock of wiles and vigor didn’t at all equal Frost’s ; still,
he promises splendidly. Early in the seventh, a heavy
cross spread-eagled James, and as he staggered up, the
wipe soared from his corner.

The Ensign, winner of Victorian Coursing
Derby, at Moonee Valley, sprung a surprise on most
people, and local coursing scribes knew little of him. He

Mr. O. Troy (Williamstown) to present owner for £B.

Australian fencing premier “Tierce” Peterkin
closed on N.S.W. Gun Club’s pigeon -slaughtering
Challenge Cup (alleged value £2l), and £2O in money, by

is that he had to win three times in all before becoming
boss butcher. First competition took place in October
last year.
One Chamber, or Two.
In' the present agitation for the reduction of the
State Parliaments and other economies, the Labor
parties are fatuously throwing away a great
opportunity. They ought to be in the forefront
of the agitation, like Uriah the Hittite and other
conspicuous characters, and directing it into
a popular demand for the reduction to a
moderate extent of the State Assemblies,
the better payment of the reduced Assem-
blies, and the abolition of Upper Houses
—these fretful dry bones which hang use-
lessly on the tree of legislation. But for no better
reason, apparently, than that some of the Labor
members might lose their seats in the process of
reduction,_ the party has held aloof and left the
agitation in the hands of the Tory gang, which is
adroitly turning it in a strictly Tory direction.
The wild cry of the Tory party is, in most cases,
for a reduction of both Houses to one-half their
present membership, whereas if the utterly
futile Legislative Councils were cast on to
the dust-heap, which is their fitting sphere of
usefulness, a reduction of the Assemblies by
one - third would be quite sufficient. The
crowd which is now engineering the movement
aims at having a few large electorates where it
hopes that, by reason of the cost involved in can-
vassing so great an area, the money-bag element
will carry the day as a general thing. It wants a
very small Assembly in which it will be possible
to buy outright a majority when any very large
public Job is under way—a thing that is often
impossible in a larger body. (The Council doesn’t
need to be bought when jobs are under way ; it is
for the job every time.) It aims, in the name of
economy, at reducing the Assembly salaries below
the level of a living wage, which is liable to fur-
ther reduce the Labor membership. And it seeks
to give the Upper'Houses a new lease of life ;
when they are reduced, any demand for real
reform will be met with the plea that the Coun-
cils have just been reformed, that the new order
of things should have a fair trial, and that con-
stant tinkering with the Constitution is undesir-
able. Parliamentary reform is a war-whoop
of some weight just now, and through
u j dismal lagging behind of the Democratic
body the Tory reform programme is the
one most before the public. It is especiallv
strong on the preservation of that aged
but mouldy bulwark of the Constitution, the
Legislative Council—the body which never origin-
ates anything or effectively repairs anything, but
merely blocks every reform measure for four or
five years, and then, when the Assembly passes it
for about the seventh time, lets it go through,
fretting as it does so, and stating that now at - last
the country is really and definitely lost. Great
Britain acquired its bi-cameral system by accident.
When the Commons first sent members to the
venerable English Parliament the landed digni-
taries seem to have had them put away by them-
selves for the same reason that the dog is put
away by himself in the kennel instead of being
allowed in the drawing-room. Britain has two
Houses now, not because it is supposed to be good
or useful or advisable to do so, but because the
people insist on having one House (the Commons)
to represent them, because they don’t want peers
m it, having realised that peers are, legislatively,
a bad lot, and because the old impression handed
down from the days when the peers formed the
whole show, that a peer has an inborn right to
sit somewhere, hasn’t been wholly got rid of.
Almost all the bi-cameral Parliaments of the
world are a servile copy of this purely accidental
British system. Yet it is a curious fact that out
of the 51 legislatures (a very miscellaneous lot of all
sorts and sizes)commonly enumerated in the British
Empire, 33 consist of only one House, and only
18, including the Mother of Parliaments itself, are
built on the bi-cameral system. The Common-
wealth might do a great deal worse than go with
the majority in this matter.

The plague, in killing Dr. Wray, Queens-
land Government medical officer, broke out in a
new direction, he being the first medico to be
attacked on the’ continent, so far. (As this is
written Dr. Maclean, of Brisbane hospital, lies
seriously ill of plague, which he is believed
to have contracted from a woman who died
at the hospital gates.) The medical man takes
fairly strict precautions when holding post-
mortems on plague subjects, and, considering
his risk, has so far come out very well. In
Vienna, recently, there was a localised outbreak
of “ lung-plague ’’-—the most deadly form of the
pest. The victim, bis doctor, his nurse and the
undertaker all died. The Sydney Chow, who has
shown, until recently, a remarkable immunity
(considering all things) in the two outbreaks,
seems to have suddenly lost it; t’other week five
Chinese died in as many days.
The Vic. Ministerial situation :
The determined effort of Melb. Age to kick out the
whole of Smiler Peacock’s team of incapables with the
object of getting the scalp of the rebellious Trenwith
seems likely only to hurt Syrae’s two intimate pals,
McCulloch and Gillott. Tuft-hunter Mac. is about the
most addled person in the whole Smiler crowd, but there
is never a word in Syme’s paper reflecting upon that fact,
and now that the old man is away crawling at Court,
that journal may reasonably be expected to award a
double thumping to Works Minister Morrissey. Also,
Samuel Gillott is about the most crumbly' old Tory in
Vic. Assembly, and every time he speaks, gives away the
fact that he is hopelessly out of touch with any kind of
reform, but David sticks by him nobly, and divides his
share of the pummelling between Burton and Dan
®uggan. But it seems pretty' definite that their two jobs
will be absorbed by other Ministers, and, as Solicitor-
General Wynne, David’s only other intimate in the
Cabinet, is cordially detested by his colleagues, he also
may find it convenient to quit. The man on top just now
is “ Weary Willie ” Trenwith, who seemed doomed to a
speedy political death until Syme’s ill-advised attempt to
finish him off still more rapidly than he was going
galvanised him into fresh life.

Losing your hair ? Do you bring out
ft combful each morning ? Has it lost
its natural brightness ? Is it beginning
to look faded and dead ?
Do you like this condition of things ?
Certainly not. Then stop this falling of
the hair at once. Stop it before your hair
is thin, short, and lifeless. Make your
hair beautiful, glossy, silky, abundant.
Ayer's Hair Vigor
- Is a Hair Food.
When your hair is well nourished it
does not come out. ’Tis weak hair,
starved hair, that falls. It’s just so
with thin hair, short hair, rough hair.
Such hair needs feeding. This is why
Ayer’s Hair Vigor stops falling of the
hair.
If your hair is gray, and you don’t
care to look at thirty as if you were
sixty, then you should use Ayer’s Hair

hair, all the dark, rich, beautiful color
It had when you were young.

Writes “ Bronze Medal ” :
Bulletin (3/5/’O2) gives a touching description of a rescue
by a distinguished M.P., as (allegedly) related by himself.
The rescued was the presiding goddess of a Manly private
bar, and the story was started by the politician gallantly
expressing a wish that he might some day be able to
prove his devotion to the p.g. by dragging her front a
cruel, watery grave. Next day, the politician was
overwhelmed with congratulations on the/actof his brave
deed. So glowing were the details as supplied to the
hero that he began to half-believe that he had dis-
tinguished himself as suggested. All town got to hear of
it, and the M.P. might be still gathering laurels had not
an officious person from the National Shipwreck Society
called on the rescued Hebe for details of her saviour’s
bravery. Her indignant assertion that she—well, what
he did assert upset the joke's future career.
Sydney Telegraph’s Maoriland correspon-
dent (sth May):—
As to the Australian criticisms anent the now famous,
if not notorious, speech delivered to the Maoris of the
Wairarapa, founded on the idea that Mr. Seddon had
advocated the letting loose of all savage customs of war
with Maori contingents, our public does not go with
them. We know here quite well that Mr. Seddon is not
bloodthirsty, and when he opened his mouth a bit wide
to the Maori, we all felt the matter would end right. The
real meaning we, most of us, took to be that the Maori,
being a better bush fighter than the Boer, would have
settled him long ago, according to the rules of modern
war, had he been allowed. It was a statement flattering
(and so intended) to the Maori, and probably far from
accurate.
Even this admirer doesn’t venture to deny that
Seddon “opened his mouth a bit wide ” and said
the things ascribed to him—the things that Seddon,
with his cheerful, off-hand lie, has since denied.
But his excuse is that Seddon didn’t mean them
when he said them, and that they were “ far from
accurate” (in other words, they were false), and
the matter “ would end right ” (i.e., Seddon would
crawl out somehow).
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-st., Melbourne, is the largest buyer Of
Opals, Sapphires, Pearls and other Australian
gems, and consignors will find it to their advantage
to send their parcels direct to him. The firm has
a reputation for straight-dealing, extending over a
period of 40 years, which is a sufficient guarantee
that they will be honorably treated. A trial par-
cel, which will be followed by direct remittance,
is solicited.
Premier Barton left the information be-
hind him as he departed Englandwards that a
commission was to be appointed to consider the
advisability of the Commonwealth taking over the
Northern Territory. Barton, who rushed to take
over New Guinea and those lands in the New
Hebrides, is strangely cautious nowadays. South
Australia can’t make the Territory pay because it
hasn’t the money to open it up; the Territory is
almost as useless to it as Australia would be to
Bulgaria. If the Federal Government doesn’t
take it, it will probably in the end be jobbed away
bodily to some syndicate. Whether it is a paying
property or not, it is necessary to take it over in
self-defence; the present tenant or bailee can’t
carry it much longer, and 500,000 square miles of
Australia can’t be dropped beside the highway,
in a manner of speaking, for anybody to pick up.

A Harp that Anyone can

Or its tones can be modulated to the soft, sweet tones of the German Zither
In addition to its wonderful tone quality, the Harp-Zither has a great many
advantages over all other Zithers. It is the only Zither which may be played
while holding vertically like the Harp, or it may be laid upon a table as is
necessary with the ordinary Zither.
Observe the diagonally crossed strings, almost the same as in a piano the
melody strings passing over the chord strings. By means of this improvement
in construction the similarity in tone and volume of the piano is produced.
Beautiful in Design, Grand, Resonant Tone, Perfection in Every Point,
and it is the easiest to learn to pla.v of any musical instrument in existence-
A child can play it almost at sight. The reason anyone can play this instru
ment on first trial, even though the person may know absolutely nothing
about music, or may not have an ear for music, is this : Each string is num-
bered, as is each note in the music, so all one has to do to render the most
difficult selections is to strike the strings as indicated by the numbers ; hence
we guarantee that anyone able to read figures can learn to play.
The Harp-Zither is built on the lines of the large harp which sells at
£2O and upwards, and to the astonishment of all the Harp-Zither has the
louder tone of the two ; in fact, its tone is similar to that of a piano.

As a parlor ornament, the instrument, with its classical outlines, is

HERR RASSMUSSEN (HANS PETER RASMUSSEN),
The Celebrated Danish Botanist,
Proprietor and Discoverer of the World -Famed Alfaline Herbal Remedies,
which have been the means of effecting the most marvellous Cures for Blood,
Skin and Nervous Diseases ever heard of in Australia.
Herr Rassmussen’s Australian Career:
It is about Twenty Years since Herr
Rassmttssen introduced his Herbal Remedies
to the Australian Public. At that time
he was only known to the public as a Botanist
pure and simple, having devoted almost his
whole life to the study of that most useful
and interesting branch of science. It how-
ever, soon dawned on Herr Rassmussen that
immense virtues existed in many plants which
were entirely unknown to medical men, and
that it was his duty towards his fellow man
to bring these new discovered Herbal Remedies
within the means of suffering humanity.
Herr Rassmussen at once set to work,
and his entire energy was directed towards
extracting the medical properties from all
kinds of plants, and putting them up in the
most suitable and practical form, according
to the nature of the complaints which they
had been found a cure for.
Pills and Powders were found to be the
most practical form to administer these new
Herbal Remedies.
It is unnecessary to particularise here the
immense success Herr Rassmussen met with
in his venture twenty years ago ; suffice it to
say that in less than twelve months the
great and wonderful cures brought about by
his Alfaline Herbal Remedies were known
throughout Australia, New Zealand, and many
other parts of the world. Testimonials and
Honors arrived from all parts. Gold Medals
from Paris and other places were awarded, and
Herr Rassmusskn’s name has been a house-
hold word ever since.— (Sydney Press.)

English law-students, in a recent Univer-
sity examination, had this question to answer :
Whether the South’African Republic, under recent cir-
cumstances, was entitled to issue an ultimatum, and to
proceed to hostilities?
All the students answered in the affirmative, and
the examiner approved this view, and publioly
stated the fact. On this point, indeed, all
teachers of international law are agreed. It is
only blind Jingoes who differ.
“ A remarkable surgical operation is re-
ported from Glasgow. An elderly woman was
admitted to the Victoria Infirmary there as an
urgent case. She was in great agony caused by a
tumor in the stomach. After she had been in the
institution for a couple of weeks an operation was
decided upon, and the task was undertaken by
three surgeons. The abdomen having been opened,
the existence of a very large growth was revealed,
and it became apparent that the woman could be
relieved only in one way, namely, by removal of
the entire stomach. This was successfully done,
and the bowel now takes the place of the stomach
effectively enough. It is reported that the patient
digests her food very well, and is steadily recover-
ing strength.”

Dear Sirs, —It gives me great pleasure to state, in answer to your letter, that my health is
very much improved since I have been wearing the Electric Belt I got from you. The very
second time I put it on I could feel the benefits immediately, and I have been only wearing it
six weeks to-night. I feel very much better all over my body, and whereas it was a misery before
to sit down or walk before I got the Belt, now it is just a pleasure. The day I left my home to
see you I had no life in ine, and felt as though life was a burden to me, and, as it was, I was
simply a “ walking misery.” But I thank God I came to you for the Belt, and I cannot tell you
how glad I am, for I feel so much better, especially with the pains in my legs ; in fact,. I am
better all over, and it is just wonderful. You can do what you like with this letter, and if it will
be of any benefit to let my fellow-sufferers know, I will be only too pleased for them to write to me,
when I will be able to tell them how bad I really was before I got the Belt. lam telling my own
personal friends all about the wonderful cure, and I do not want to make any secret of it at all.
I am, yours very gratefully,

Of this number 375,000 Shares, fully jjaid up to £1 per Share, are to be issued to the Vendors, and the
balance of 175,000 Shares are offered to the public (and for these applications by bona-nde
customers and employees of the Vendor Company will have priority to the extent of 10,000
shares), payable: ss. on application, ss. on allotment, at the office of the Broker of the
Company, and the balance at the Office of the Company one month from date of allotment.
The proceeds of the 175,000 Shares will be paid to the Vendors.
Directors: Hon. J. T. TOOHEY, M.L.C. Hon. HENRY MOSES, M.E.O. J. T. TOOHEY, Esq.

Bankers: THE BANK OF AUSTRALASIA.
Solicitors: Mr. F. B. FREEIIILL ; Messrs. MACNAMARA & SMITH; Mr. WALTER G. PARISH.
Broker: Mr. JOHN R. JONES, Yaralla Chambers, Pitt Street.
THE Company is formed for the purpose of acquiring- from the Vendors as a going concern the old-established and
lucrative Brewery Business carried on by them as “ J. T. & J. TOOHEY, Ltu.,” in the State of New South Wales,
including their extensive Brewery Establishment in Sydney, together with their capacious Cellars, Wine Stores, new
Malt House, Aerated Waters Factory, Ice House, Bottling Establishment, Stables, and Various Freehold and Lease-
hold Hotels, and other properties in Sydney and Suburbs, and at Newcastle, and the Book Debts, Plant, Goodwill and
other assets of the business in terms of the contract hereinafter referred to.
The Freehold and Leasehold Properties (exclusive of a very large number of Leasehold Hotels having various
unexpired terms up to 2] years, which are given in) have been valued by Messrs. Hardie and Gorman and Richardson
and Wrench, Ltd., in conjunction (as to the Newcastle properties) with Messrs. Creer and Berkeley. The Valuation,
dated 24th March, 1902, is £287,418, of which £273,168 represen s the value of the Brewery Premises and Freehold
Properties actually owned by the Vendors, and £14,250 the value of Leases of Hotel Properties leased to the Vendors,
having various unexpired terms from 21 to 90 years.
The, preponderance in value of Freehold Hotels over Hotels held on Lease evidences the strength and stability of
the concern.
Messrs. Hardie & Gorman, and Richardson & Wrench, Limited, in their report, say, “ In estimating the value of
the Hotels, we have not taken into consideration the twofold advantages which you possess—namely, the rental
value on the one hand, and the hold upon the business on the other. We have rather regarded them from the fair
market value point of view.”
After making provision for all known bad and doubtful debts, and providing for unforeseen contingencies, the
book debts are stated at £136,067 ss. The stock is valued at £54,447. Accordingly the valuation of the assets, ex-
clusive of goodwill, is as under :

Shareholders will (as is not the case with a Company formed to establish or develop a new industry) sf ire a
really remunerative and increasing business, in full working order, and returning well ascertained profits. A
ence to the Joint Certificate of Messrs. Jas. Robertson, Priestly and Co. and Messrs. Miles and Vane, set out i.t foot
hereof, will make this clear, and the profits should be substantially augmented by the Aerated Waters and Cordial
Manufactory, which is practically a new addition to the business. The new Malt House has started work, and con-
siderable savings will be thereby effected.
The position of the Brewery is both central and attractive, and the erection of the new Central Railway premises
in its immediate vicinity will no doubt increase its value. A large portion Of the buildings (which are of stone and
brick) has been recently erected, specially designed on up-to date lines for the most economical carrying on of the
business. The buildings, which are most substantial, having been erected by Messrs. Toohey to suit the require-
ments of their extensive trade, are in good order, and, without doubt, of their kind, unsurpassed in the Southern
Hemisphere.
The Brewery Plant and Machinery are of the very best description, and are so extensive that any future
expansion of the business can be provided for by a comparatively small outlay.
The high quality of the Vendors’ Malt Liquors is well known.
Founded about 1870 by the Hon. J. T. Toohey and his brother, the late Mr. James M. Toohey, the Brewery has
within a comparatively short period attained its present strong position.
The Hon. J. T. Toohey, after many years of active business, is desirous of being relieved somewhat from the
pressure of management, and that is the sole reason for this Company being formed.
It will be observed that the Vendors retain 375,000 shares out of the 550,000 shares into which the Capital of the
Company is divided. No stronger guarantee can be offered of their confidence in the continued prosperity of the
concern.
The Hon. J. T. Toohey and Mr. J. T. Toohey are under obligation to serve the Company for a period of Seven
years, with special remuneration for so doing. The former is not to be compelled to devote his exclusive attention
to the business, and will only draw remuneration while actually engaged in the service of the Company. Mr. J. T.
Toohey is to devote the whole of his time and attention to the business of the Company. The Hon. J. T.* Toohey and
his representatives have, under the conditions set forth in the contract hereinafter referred to, power to nominate a
successor for the period therein mentioned.
Both gentlemen have entered into an agreement not to be engaged in a similar business within 300 miles of
Sydney for a period of Ten years under very heavy penalties.
The Company takes over the business as from the 31st January last, and becomes entitled to the profits from that
date. Out of such profits the Vendors are to be paid interest on the amount at the rate and for the term mentioned
in the Contraot hereinafter referred to. After providing for this payment, there will be a substantial balance to go
to the credit of the new Company.
The Company receives the benefit and undertakes the obligations of Current contracts, as well as of current trade
liabilities, which are estimated at about £13,500.
It is intended to declare dividends half-yearly.
The whole of the charges incidental to the formation of the Company, including brokerage, advertising, legal
expenses, etc., will be borne by the new Company.
The following Contract has been entered into, and can be seen at the office of Mr. Walter G. Parish, Solicitor,
Martin Place :
Ist May, 1902.—J. T. &J. Toohey, Limited, Ist part; Hon. John Thomas Toohey, 2nd part ; John Thomas
Toohey, 3rd part ; John Rider Jones, 4th part; the said Hon. John Thomas Toohey, John Thomas Toohey, and
Francis Bede Freehill of the sth part.
The original Certificate of the Accountants and the original Valuation of Messrs. Hardie and Goiman, and
Richardson and Wrench, Limited, can be seen at the office of the Broker of the Company.
The business is being taken over subject to all existing contracts in connection therewith. These are of the
ordinary trade character, but, including as they do numerous contracts with the Company’s customers, Builders,
and others, cannot be specified. Technically such contracts are or may be contracts within section 66 of the Com-
panies Act, 1899, but applicants for shares will be held to have had notice and to have waived their right to be
supplied with particulars of such Contracts.

“John R. Jones, Esq., ' “Sydney,
“ Yaralla Chambers, Pitt-street. “ 3rd April, 1902.
“ Dear Sir,—We have examined the Books and Accounts of Messrs. J. T. and J. Toohey for the three
years and seven months ended 31st January, 1902, and find that the Net Profits earned (after providing for
depreciation of Plant, Machinery and Leasehold Properties, and a full allowance for Bad and Doubtful Debts,
and writing off all charges of every description other than Directors’Fees, Interest and Income Tax), were
as under :
“ For the year ended 30th June, 1899 .. .. .. .. £49,387 8 0
“ For the year ended 30th June, 1900 .. .. .. .. 54,827 7 4
“ For the year ended 30th June, 1901 .. .. .. .. 59,717 14 4
“ For the seven months ended 31st January, 1902 .. .. .. 33,154 14 8
£197,087 4 4
“ equal to an Average Net Profit for the whole period covered of £55,001 Is. Bd. per annum.
“ Included in the last seven months’period were considerable charges that would normally be spread
over a whole year. “ Yours faithfully,
“ (Signed) James Robertson, Priestley and Co.
“(Signed) Miles and Vane.”
Taking the average profits in terms of Certificate at £55,000 per annum, the result would, after providing for a
Dividend of 7 per cent, per annum, Directors’ Fees and Income Tax, show a balance still available of about £li,ooo.
If the profits of 1901, as appearing by the Certificate, are taken as a test, then there would be a balance of about
£16,000.
It will be observed that in arriving at their estimate of Profits, the Accountants have been satisfied that ample
provision has been made for depreciation of Plant, Machinery, and Leasehold Property, together with full allowance
for bad and doubtful debts and all necessary charges.
Most makes of .22 caliber cartridges are as variable as some
men’s watches. Cartridges out of the same box won’t
shoot alike. Some go high, some go low and some don’t
go at all. This is not true of
WINCHESTER
.22 Short and .22 Long Cartridges.
They shoot well all the time, and shoot just where you hold.
Special powder made according to carefully determined and
tested formulas is used in loading Winchester Cartridges
and every bullet is swaged by special machinery which
makes them uniform in size, weight and density. This
modern method of manufacture coupled with a rigid sys-
tem of tests makes Winchester Cartridges better than any
other brand on the market. A trial will convince you.


The Greatest Thief in the World.
No, it is not the man who removes your goods
in the night, nor the plausible diamond-studded
gentleman who takes your hard-earned cash in
exchange for shares in some worthless mine.
Thieves they are, without doubt; but not the
greatest of thieves. There is a far subtler thief
than they, and, moreover, what he robs you of is
more valuable than your money. He was named
and rated many years ago by a celebrated poet
when he rote “Procrastination is the thief of
Time ” —procrastination, postponement, the put-
ting off of the doing of something which ought
to be done now; time, the intangible stuff of
which life is made up. The man who is robbed
of his gold may possibly recover it; the man who
is robbed of his time has lost so much of his life
utterly and for ever.
Now, here is Mrs. Maria Jenkinson, of No. 7
Searle-street, Sydney, N.S.W., a lady who has not
yet reached middle age, but whose health broke
down so long ago as June, 1886. A good many
things have happened since 1886, among them
the recovery of Mrs. Jenkinson’s health in 1891;
but there is no good and sufficient reason why
that desirable event should not have taken place
five years earlier. The means which restored
Mrs. Jekinson to health were as easily obtainable
in 1886 as in 1891, or as they are now. Perhaps
Erocrastination has something to answer for here.
iet us listen to what Mrs. Jenkinson herself has
to say on the matter. —“Until June, 1886, I was
biassed with sound health; I could eat, sleep,
and work well. Then came a change; I grew
listless, despondent, and irritable. My sleep was
disturbed by dreams, and there was an ever-
present sensation of weight on my chest. My
appetite failed, and I became so emaciated and
weak I could scarce crawl about. A furred
tongue, biliousness, and severe headache had
become my normal condition. For five years did
I fight against my illness, and was attended by
six doctors, who all agreed that I was suffering
from chronic dyspepsia, and were all alike in
failing to relieve me. After also trying various
advertised remedies with no better result, I was
induced to buy a bottle of Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup. The first bottle mitigated my
worst symptoms, and when I had taken the third
bottle I felt like myself again. Eight bottles
of Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup did for me in
six months what six doctors failed to accomplish
in five years—restored to me health and strength.
For years past I have never on any account
been without Mother Seigle’s Curative Syrup in
the house.”
It is never too late to do a good thing; but it
is better to do it first than last.*

sending in of its joint resignation shows it doesn’t
even possess its own confidence. Yet the only
result of its dismissal would be to put the Opposi-
tion in its place, the said Opposition being
mostly the feeble, futile Irvine, the awful
Gillies, and the dilettante, disastrous Shiels.
And through this country’s slavish imitation of
British customs, and a confirmed notion that
nothing political is good that doesn’t follow on the
lines of the “ Brit’sh Cons’tooshun,” it is impos-
sible to dismiss any one or two Ministers—though
they be as incompetent as an ant under a
road-roller —without sacking the good as well
as the bad and replacing them by a pos-
sibly even worse combination. The party
system was not created in England because
England saw any merit in it, but because
the Commons happened to split on a question
which made reconciliation or coalition practically
impossible, and it has remained split ever since.
Australia adopted the idea without any definite
line of cleavage, just as it might have ordered that
the Premier should always walk with a crutch
because the British Premier was lame, or just as
it might have ordered that there should be tunnels
on all its railways, even on the western plains,
because such things were necessary (and darned
expensive) in Britain. In Queensland the old
Opposition perished because it couldn’t tell
itself from the Government. In N.S.W.
See and Lee are duplicates of each
other, and in S.A. Jenkins and Darling
are supposed to hate each other for think-
ing exactly the same way. The process
suited to these conditions is to let the House elect
the Ministry. Then the party which doesn’t like
that Ministry, if there is such a party, will form
an Opposition and elect a leader; and if there is
no such party it won’t. As things are now a Lee or
a Darling party has to be bribed by the reversion
of the Premiership to hate the Government, even
if it has no objection to the Government. Also if
there are just enough good men in the House to
form a Government the country has to do without
the services of some of them, and put up with
inferior men in their stead, for some of the good
men must be saved up for the job of hating the
Government on the Opposition benches, and
objecting to it, and calling it bad names. Since
the fiscal question went out of State politics the
struggle to prevent the so-called Opposition from
looking so like the Government that they can’t be
told apart has become pitiable. And the real
Opposition, which is mostly the Labor Party, and
which opposes on principle, is abused for upsetting
old traditions—whereas it is the only party that
adheres to the old traditions.
Queensland’s Central Sugar Mills.
A cane-grower in one of the leading tropical
sugar districts of Queensland writes the following
remarks. His name and address can be supplied
to any inquiring sugar-mill director who desires
them —but they wont:
If the Federal Parliament is sincere in its desire for a
White Australia it should take over the control of the
Sugar Works Guarantee Act from the Q. Government.
This Act, when passed, was supposed to be a measure to
enable the small cane-growers to co-operatively erect
central mills. There is no doubt the central-mill idea is
a good one—the only means by which it is possible for the
small men to enter upon sugar-growing. But the mills
must be owned by the cane-growers and the con-
stitution of the central mill co.’s—in order to ensure
these being of service—must be such as will provide
against any one man, or two or three men, having control
of the management of the co’s. That was the original
conception of the S.W.G. Act. But that is not the spirit
in which the Q. Continuous Government makes the ad-
vances. In the majority of the mills, the State moneys
lent under the Act were lent to a few large landholders,
who used the Act to enable them to sell their properties
at a greatly enhanced figure while retaining practically
all the voting-power in the central mill co’s. In this
matter, the Pleystowe Central Mill Co., of Mackay, stands
out pretty prominently. A syndicate bought the old
Pleystowe mill and estate (about 4000 acres) for £4OOO.
This was valued under the S.W.G. Act, but was not of
sufficient value to secure the necessary advance
to erect a mill. Balnagowan estate (of 5000 acres)
was then joined with Pleystowe, and the Govern-
ment advanced a sum, of which, at the present moment,
£39,000 is unpaid. It might be mentioned here that the
Pleystowe Land Syndicate sold the old mill site of about
10 acres to the Pleystowe Central Mill Co., Ltd. True,
they say the money has not yet been paid over, but when
the prominent members of the land syndicate are direc-
tors of the mill co. there is nothing to prevent them
handing over the money to themselves at any moment.
The Pleystowe Land Syndicate and Mr. John Cook, of
Balnagowan, or their agents, induced people to settle
on Pleystowe or Balnagowan, selling them land
at, in the great majority of cases, from- £8 to
£lO per acre. Incidentally it might be remarked
that the Pleystowe land had been growing cane for
20 or 25 years at this time in the usual plantation style
(manureless) and that one farm on the Balnagowan
Estate which was sold at £8 per acre had been offered to
a man, who refused to take it, at 10s. per acre a year or
two before the erection of a mill was contemplated.
The Central Mill, built with State money, thus
increased the value of these rich men’s land sixteen-
fold. In the Central Mill co. the farmers were
allotted one share per acre. The farms contained from
50 to 100 acres each. The qualification for a director
was to be 500 shares in his own right, thus making it
practically impossible for a farmer to become a director
at the price which was charged for the land, to say nothing
of the fact that only 5000 shares were allowed to be allot-
ted to farmers (vide Mr. W. Steedman, one of the members
of the Pleystowe Land Syndicate and promoter of the
Mill Co., at the recent inquiry) out of an issue of 60,000
shares. The other 55,000 shares were reserved for the
members of the Pleystowe Land Syndicate and Mr. John
Cook, or, as the articles of association had it, the
directors could dispose of shares as they pleased.
The only men who held sufficient shares to
qualify as directors were E. M. Long, chair-
man of the Pleystowe Land Sj’ndicate, W. Steedman,
secretary of the same, and John Cook, of Balnagowan ;
so the situation may be summed up thus : One or two
big landholders received from the Government, at very
low interest, the money to put up a central mill. The
fact of the mill being put up (with Government money)
increased the value of their land about sixteenfold, and
enabled them to make large fortunes. And these big
landholders still retain sole control of the mill (put up
with Government money), take the biggest part of the
profits, and as bosses of the mill, on which the prosperity
of the district depends, can make the farmers obey them
in almost everything. Moreover, the fanners are
mostly mortgaged to the land syndicate, which is
practically the same as the Central Sugar Mill direc-
torate. The directors are thorough believers in black
labor, and, in fact, colored labor of every description,
and possess the power to make things very unhandy for
any farmer with white labor tendencies. Wherever the
large landholders secured mills the same state of affairs
as at Pleystowe exists in a greater or less degree. If the
Federal Parliament desires to establish a white cane-
sugar industry on a firm basis in Australia—and this can
only be done by a system of small farmers growing cane
for central mills—it should take over immediately the
control of the S.W.G. Act. There is no use in expecting
ths Philp Govt, to administer fairly any Act tending to
d away with alien labor.

An American writing from St. Helena :
Colonel Paget has cleared the camp of all the Boer
scum. These number about 200, and have sold their souls
for a tin of jam—that being all the extra ration they get
for taking the oath of allegiance to England,
At Poverty Point.
Melb. Age : “ Mdlle. Lotty will introduce some new
features.” But how can she ?
People up in the Beechworth and Wangaratta district
(Vic.) have just found a male Amy Castles, and seem
intent on booming the young man for all he’s worth.
Local press describes him as “ possessed of a voice of
extraordinary compass comprising four octaves, and his
rendition of the high 0 showed a phenomenal ability.
Either as a tenor or soprano he appears to be equally
successful, his voice being powerful, but well modulated,
and in some passages of surprising sweetness.” Also,
they remark that this fortunate youth was greeted with
“ simultuous applause,” which is probably a new kind of
hand-clap specially invented for the laudation of the
combination of Reevesand Patti. Itma3 r beparenthetically
remarked that if this prodigy from the Kelly gang dis-
trict really does possess a four-octave voice, with the high
C, presumably soprano, or an octave higher than Dani’s,
as the terminal note, he must likewise be a basso
profundo, as the lower C is far and away deeper
than any but the most phenomenal basses can dive
after. The best that could be done with a voice
of three different kinds would be to abolish two of the
varieties, after which it would probably be found that the
one remaining was only small and tin-kettly after all.
Many women can sing from 2.) to 3 octaves, and London
was once paralysed temporarily by a lady contralto-bari-
tone, but the four-octave voice seems physically impos-
sible, unless the young man has two throats of different
formations—which would be a doubtful advantage in the
event of his being very thirsty.
Veteran Wybert Reeve has collaborated with Sutton
Vane, the successful melodrama-merchant, in the produc-
tion of a play of M.L. life which will practically introduce
Maoriland to the London stage. The new play should be
a good payable subject, appealing alike to the stummick
and the Jingo spirit of Sutton Vane’s public. Maoriland
is “where the latest English mutton comes from,” also it
has acquired a gory notoriety through its copious
discharge of cohentingents for S’Africa.
“ Melb.” : A fashionable amateur performance of “ A
Runaway Girl ” is being got up, at St. Kilda Town Hall.
Bet you somebody runs away with somebody else’s wife
over the thing.
“ Flyman ” : It is hoped that Robert Brough will pub-
lish a record of his 16 years’ management in Australia.
Playgoers would like to have managerial details re the
productions of the remarkable series of comedies during
this period. They would like to know something about
the taste of audiences in the different capitals ; which
dramas paid, and which drew for a brief, blighting week ;
anecdotes of the actors of these palmy days of comedy,
and the Brough views on management, stage and other-
wise, and the art dramatique. Think on’t, Robert.
Dear Bulletin.— As as old Londoner who knows what
is what in theatrical matters, I may be permitted to
laugh at “R.B.’s” "disclosure” (in last “ Pov. Point”)
of “ the secret of the trashy character of some plays
which go out to Australia as ‘ great London successes.’ ’*
“ R. 8.,” evidently a new-chum in the big city, tells you
that “ the gilt-edged melodrama comes (to Australia)
from some theatre in a filthy suburb —Islington or Ham-
mersmith. A London triumph is thus often equivalent
to a wonderful success at Geelong.” Now the filthy
portions of Islington are situated within two miles of
London G.P.O. The suburbs of London, in a cockney
way of speaking, are populated mainly by people with
some pretensions to education. Nonsensical lurid melo-
drama doesn’t live on suburban patronage. It is written
for the delectation of the utterly uneducated classes in
London and the large provincial manufacturing towns,
especially the latter, because it is chiefly in the northern
English centres of population that toilers who cannot
read or write are able to earn fair wages. The average
muck produced in Australia as a “ famous London suc-
cess” is probably unknown to any part of the metropolis.
It never gets a show in the prosperous suburbs. It is the
drama of lamentable ignorance, as ignorance goes in
Britain, and the fact that it can nowadays obtain steady
patronage in representative Australian theatres, where it
could not have flourished 20 years ago, is something for
politicians to reflect upon. The audiences here are better
educated than the Britishers for whom these awful
dramas are built, but they seem to take the stuff quite as
seriously.—E.
Of all the so-called “ problem ” plays there is but one
that presents a real problem to the mind of a thoughtful
audience. Jones’s “The Liars” is the exception. Did
Jones intend Jessica to be a forgiveable or a hateful
character ? She doesn’t even affect innocence of the harm
she is doing to her infatuated lover, and her only moment
of remorse on the infatuated one’s account is when she
admits to him that she is a coward. Having fooled him
all she can by encouraging him to fool himself, she finally
settles down to a life of contentment and oyster suppers
with the husband whose jealousy she had delighted to
aggravate. A philosopher will say that Lady Jessica is
only one of a natural type of attractive women. God
made lots more like her. But then God makes tempting
poisonous berries and instinctive murderesses, whose
figures are irreproachable, and will-o’-the-wisps and lots
of other essentially hateful things.
Cobb and Co. have abandoned as a hope-
less case their mail-contracts in the dry interior of
Queensland, The feed-account, usually about
£6OOO, promises this year to be £30,000, and the
mail-contract (which was entered into before
Providence cursed this country with an extra
special drought on account of its iniquitous war-
policy) won’t nearly cover the outlay. The co.
states frankly that it had to stop because its over-
draft could go no further, and its horses couldn’t
run on credit and eat promissory notes. On
4000 miles of Q. roads the familiar form of
“ Cobb’s coach ” will be seen no longer, unless
the Federal Government comes to the rescue,
which it must do. Mails have stopped. Passenger
traffic has stopped. The carriage of food (many
people got their victuals sent them by parcel
post) has largely stopped. Over an immense area
of country no man can write to his best girl now ;
nobody can be dunned through the post; bagmen
who went out can’t get back ; and civilisation has
practically fallen asunder. The link that kept it
together was Cobb’s coaoh, and without Cobb
there is Chaos.
Kaiser William has foolishly given Chris-
tian Science the advertisement of a “ persecution’
by excluding several fashionable patrons of the
new faith from the German Court.
Waxellency Madden was 58 on Friday
(May 15) of this week. He is exactly a year
older than Lord Carrington, who has just
been worsted in his fight for the privilege of help-
ing to lackey the King at the Coronation cere-
mony. Henniker Heaton will be 54 to-morrow
{Sunday). By the way, British high officialdom
doesn’t know what to do with Henniker H. He
is one of the best-advertised men in the Empire,
and everyone knows his name and the good work
he has done in connection with the post-office.
The public in general consider that he ought to be
made an Earl or something, but the Colonial
Office isn’t taking any Lord Henniker Heaton !
“ Longshoreman ” to The Bulletin :
Feat of the Boveric men, 'who came 1500 miles in an
open boat for aid for their shipmates, knocks such per-
formances as Slocum’s Spray voyage into a cocked hat.
Chief-officer Hay man, and second officer M’Oarthy had
■no incentive of money, theirs was a matter of plain duty.
Neither had they months to prepare ; possibly 24 hours
was the period that elapsed between the decision being
come to and departure taken. Such gear as the average
•coaster carries (for until recently the Boveric was engaged
in the coal traffic) had to be made to serve. Imagine
being cooped up in a 24ft. open ship’s lifeboat for 26 days,
nary a sight of land until the last day, and only one
steamer sighted (which passed on her way unheeding).
For practically a whole month those two officers must
have taken watch and watch about with every nerve
strained. These, be it noted, are the men whom it is the
•custom to refer to as common sailors, members of a
badly-paid and hardly-worked calling. Had that boat
belonged to one of King Ned’s cruisers, the whole
wide world would ring with news of the feat, and
•decorations and rewards galore would shower on the
heads of the gallant four. But because they are
merchantmen none, save perhaps the committee of Lloyds,
will be found to recognise the worth and pluck of the
men who carried the job through. We make much fuss
and many presentations of fancy nick-nacks to departing
and returning contingenters, but the odds are that this
•crew won't reap much reward. Posturers take precedence
of heroes nowadays.
The decision of Victorian Premier Pea-
oock not to accept the resignation of his ill-
regulated team puts the finishing touch on a very
long-winded joke. Six months ago all Peacock’s
subordinates except Trenwith were reported to
have signed a joint resignation, so that if Peacock
felt it his duty to reconstruct the Ministry on a
smaller and more economical basis he could do so.
It appears, however, that the resignations were
not to take effect till May I—reason not stated.
So on May 1 Solicitor-General Wynne handed in
the long-forgotten paper, to the great indignation
of the resigning Ministers, who thought it had
heen lost. Peacock didn’t accept the resignation
at the time, because he didn’t receive it, and he
refuses to accept it now that he has'received it,
because it is a six-months’-old document and quite
mouldy and out-of-date. The whole business is as
mysterious as a man lending himself 6d. and then
hiding the 1.0. U. under a tub.

A COMPLETE CURE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.—Dear Sir,—l am writing to tell you
about the wonderful cure your medicine has effected in
niy case. About three years ago I began to cough. At
first the cough was not severe, but it gradually got worse,
and I became very weak and troubled with night sweats,
pain in my chest, and great quantities of phlegm. On
several occasions there was blood in the expectorated
matter. I had been treated by a doctor, who pronounced
my case to be Consumption, and various other treatments
had been tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage
that I heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for
a course of the medicine. When it arrived I was too ill to
leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at once, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two lots
of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure, for
which accept my very best thanks.—Yours gratefully,
J. BLAIR.

“Mr. W. G. Hearne, Geelong.—
“Dear Sir, —
Your letter and Bronchitis Cure to hand quite safe.
I am sure you will be glad to know that your Bronchitis
Cure has quite cured me. I was very glad when it came,
as I was suffering from a severe attack of Bronchitis at the
time it arrived. I had sent for my own doctor, but had
not had one night’s rest for a week. I started taking the
Bronchitis Cure three times a day as directed, and was
very much eased at once. At the end of a week I only
took it twice a day, and then only every night for a
week, as I was so much better when, thanks to the Lord
for adding His blessing, I was quite well, and walked into
town and back without feeling any fatigue. I had not
done that previously for 12 months—always went in the
omnibus—as walking caused me such pain and distress in
the chest. I always walk now, and never feel it, and I
am stronger than I have been for years. I thank my son
for his great kindness in sending the medicine, and am,
dear Sir,
“Yours very truly,
“M. MORTIMER.’
Extract from a letter, since written by the same lady to
her son, Mr. John S. Mortimer, Llenwellyn, Katunga,

HER DAUGHTER HAD BEEN VERY ILL.
SPITTING UP BLOOD.
TIIE DOCTOR SAID NOTHING MORE COULD BE
DONE.
CURED BY HEARNE'S BRONCHITIS CURE.
The extract runs as follows:—“ As for myself, thank
the Lord, lam feeling stronger than I have for years. I
had an attack of Bronchitis in November, but Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure was again successful. I feel quite well,
and walk into town feeling quite strong.
“ I must ask you to send me six bottles more of the
medicine, as I wish to have a supply in the house. I
have tried to get it made up here, and let my chemist
have a bottle to see what he could do. He tells me this
week he can make nothing out of it, he never saw any-
thing like it before, so there is only one thing for me to
do—send for more. I have never kept in bed one day
since I commenced to take it. I used to be in bed a fort-
night at a time always, and after that for months I was
as weak as I could possibly be, and was always taking
cod liver oil, so you will see at once it is quite worth
I while sending for it such a iong distance.
[ “ Something more I must tell you. Charlotte has been
very ill since I wrote you. Her cough was so bad she
never had a night’s rest, and was spitting up blood
very much. The doctor told her husband that there was
nothing more he could do for her. So on the Sunday I
sent her half a bottle of the Bronchitis Cure, and told
her to try it, and if she did not use it, not to waste it,
but send it back again. She had such confidence in her
doctor that I thought she would not try it. On the
Wednesday I sent over again, and she was much better,
the night’s rest was very good, and cough and bleeding
from the lungs better. She sent for another half-bottle,
and on the following Sunday sent over to say that she
was quite cured and did not require any more" medicine.
So you see what great good it has done, and she wishes
to have some of my next supply."

DISTRESSING, SUFFOCATING, DRY COUGH

“Sir.—My wife was for twelve years a sufferer from
a most distressing, suffocating, dry cough that could not
be removed or even eased by any remedy, doctors’
prescriptions and patent medicines having been tried ;
but I am happy to say that the cough, pain in the chest,
and difficulty of breathing, etc., were entirely removed by
the fifth dose of your Bronchitis Cure.—l remain, Sir,

small bottle cured my little girl, who had been suffering
for five years, and now I do not feel safe to be without it.

A Seven Years’ Case.
EXPECTORATING BLOOD AND MATTER.
COMPLETELY CURED.
" Mr. W. G. Hearne.
“Dear Sir,—Your medicine has cured me of bronchitt
and asthma, from which I suffered for upwards of seven
years, during which period I was scarcely ever free from
coughs, and frequently the difficulty of breathing was so
distressing that for nights in succession I had to sit up.
I write you this acknowledgment from a sense of duty, as
in my case every other treatment had failed. For a v’ear
previous I had been getting very much worse, and at the
time I obtained your medicine I was confined to bed
suffering from a most violent cough, expectorating blood
and matter, and apparently beyond hope of recovery.
The first dose of the medicine gave me welcome relief,
and I steadily improved as I continued the treatment]
until I became, as I am now, quite well. —Yours sincerely,’
H. WALKER, Balmain, Sydney.”
Asthma.
PREVIOUS TREATMENT FAILED.
A SEVENTEEN YEARS’ CASE.
CURED BY THREE BOTTLES.
Mr. Alex. J. Anderson, of Oak Park, Charleville
Queensland, writes “After suffering from Asthma for
17 years, and having been under a great many different
treatments without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne’s
medicine for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this
medicine I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then
which was in the beginning of 1883— 15 years ago—l have
not had the slightest return of it. The medicine quiie
cured me, and I have much pleasure in recommending it ”
Writing again on the 4th April, 1899, he states -—“ I
am keeping very well now. Never have the slightest
return of the Asthma.”

A Woman’s Ethics.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
George Vennaker sat gloomily pondqring over
the new phase of life which had come to him. He
sighed as he glanced at the empty chair opposite,
and irritably kicked the footstool on the hearth-
rug-on which he had so often seen her feet rest-
ing when she was there—as, turning to the table,
he helped himself from a decanter, and then re-lit
his pipe. He glanced round the comfortable
room —everything was just the same, and yet
with what an oppressive sense of difference ! He
had fancied that in time he would get used to it,
but he had come to learn the futility of this hope
—to find that the house was haunted by her—
for wherever aforetime she had been, there was
she now. Even at this moment he imagined he
could see her sitting facing him, as she used to
when he read or talked to her. He remembered
how he would glance at her in odd moments, and
wonder what were the thoughts behind that
intent, absorbed face. He had often marvelled,
too, at her wonderful instinct and fore-
knowledge, and as a child’s cry reached his
ears from an adjoining room he specu-
lated whether some mysterious agency would
carry that to her, for he recalled how she would
rise hurriedly from her chair at sounds which
reached her, but not him (although he was quick
of hearing), and, after lifting a warning finger,
noiselessly move away— knowing how the child
had how she would find it, whether it
ailed.
A knock at the door, and the housekeeper
entered.
“The little one is still restless, sir—maybe shes
sickening for something. I seen one of my own,
when my pore ’usband was ”
“ I’ll call at the doctor’s on my way to town in
the morning, and get him to come and see her,”
abruptly interposed Vennaker. . . “No —nothing
more, thanks. Good night, Mrs. Evly.”
“ May as well turn in, too, I suppose,’’ he
muttered, turning out the lamp. Walking quietly
to the bedroom, he bent down and examined
the face of the child as it lay sleeping, restlessly,
in its cot. He touched the small hand, and kissed
the half-opened mouth, and noticed how hot and
dry they were. The night was warm and oppres-
sive, and he opened wide the French window
leading to the verandah and garden, and smiled as
he remembered how, at one time, he had to give
up this habit because of the nervous terror of one
who would, perchance, suddenly clasp him in the
night and, tremblingly, bid him to listen !
And presently some choking sense of tender-
ness came to him, as he lay musing in bed, watch-
ing the shaft from the moon which now struck
across the room, and scenting the perfume from
the flower-heaped garden—with its single gum
shading the bench beneath. God! if these
thoughts would not come, then parting were
easier! Why was it that all remembrance of her
defects had faded—the numberless traits which
used to annoy him, because, to his man’s mind,
they seemed so small, and lacking in justice—
and that his memory was flooded only with the
hundred qualities he had loved in her —the very
weakness of some of which had made them the
more captivating, because of their essential femi-
ninity, and the need they imposed on her to seek
his strength and protection !
He reached an arm towards the pillow near his
own, and laughed quietly hG folly—but per-
mitted it to remain ther . # The action did not
strike him as peculiar, for he was only just con-
scious of having performed it, notwithstanding
the singular circumstance that some vague sense
of expectation lay half-revealed in his brain. He
was drowsy now, and mere speculation had
ceased, and it was because his senses were dulled
that he did not notice the moonray across the
room was now broken and shimmering, and that
some strange perfume was present. But a vague
consciousness came to him in his sleep that his
arm was becoming cramped, and, as he instinc-
tively moved it, that something had rested upon
it which was now removed.
Suddenly a sound startled him—the hour of one,
struck by the clock on the mantel-piece. He
opened his eyes, and in a moment was awake, with
every faculty clear, alert, tense. Prompted by
some obscure suggestion, he noiselessly raised his
head, and peered across the room—instinctively
towards the child’s cot: and there he saw her !
He knew it was she in a moment; the well-known
lavender odour from her dress reached him now,
and there was some unaccustomed fragrance on
his pyjama sleeve.
He looked with distended eyes, and a sense of
the overwhelming wonder of it! He heard her
kisses, and the unknowing, responsive murmurs of
the little sleeper, the slight clink of the spoon
against the glass as she moistened its lips, and a
suppressed, choking sob, as, holding the child’s
hands in her own—so white as the moon caught
them, and made the rings on her fingers to glisten
—she bent over it, and peered hungrily into the
flushed face. Then she lifted its head, reversed
the pillow, adjusted afresh the clothes of the cot,
and commenced to move quietly away.
As Vennaker lay back and closed his eyes, he
felt her presence approaching him, and his heart
beat. A longing to caress her once more took
hold of him, and made his blood course turbu-
lently through his veins. For a moment he was
curbed by the reflection of the folly of undoing all
that had been done—with such bitter heartache
for both of them—but he realised the weakness
that was upon him. He fancied that she would
steal silently over to him, that he would feel her
bending over his face, the slight current of her
breath, perhaps the touch of her lips—and then
there rushed suddenly across his mind the memory
of moments of passion they had spent together.
Well, let it come ! Let everything else go ! Gould
he not forget the bad past, and live only in that
which now haunted him, and in the new future
they would make together ?
. . . And a sense of keen disappointment and
defeat came upon him when he realised that she
had gone ! He rose hastily, and looked—sprang
to the ground, and gained the verandah—but all
was still. A sickening foreboding, too, struck
him chill—she didn’t wish a renewal of his love ;
had grown indifferent to him through the means
he had taken —had, perhaps, formed another and
more absorbing passion. He did not deny to him-
self the reasonableness of this, but it only served
now to awaken a strange sense of rivalry and
opposition, in which her value as an object to be
acquired became suddenly enhanced. He reflected
a few moments on this new phase of the subject,
and then smiled at the plan which occurred to
him ; and with a pleasing sense that it would be
successful, he at length found slumber.
Mrs. Evly received with a few sniffs and tosses
»f the head the orders which Vennaker gave her
in the morning.
“This is Mrs. Vennaker’s day of calling to see
the child,” he said. “ When she comes, tell her I
shall be absent till ten o’clock to-morrow evening,
It is just possible she may wish to remain and
nurse Minnie; if she does, allow her to do so, and
show her all the attention you can. If Minnie
should become worse, send to me at once at this
address ” —handing to her a slip of paper, with the
name of an hotel written on it.
* * * • .
It was with a new sense of trepidation that
Vennaker looked at his watch, as he reached his
house on the following afternoon. Five o’clock !
He noted with a little thrill, when he let himself
in, that a sunshade stood in the hall—and then lie
heard her voice in the bedroom. Hanging up his
hat, and placing his walking-stick in the stand, he
strode quietly to the kitchen, and questioned Mrs.
Evly with a look.
“ She’s come round wonderful, sir, so I didn’t
send for you. Mrs. Vennaker’s not gone yet,”
she said, half-apologetically; “we didn’t expect
you till ten.”
“ Quite right,” he answered. And then, with
assumed indifference, “Kindly give Mrs.. Ven-
naker my compliments, and ask her if she
will step into the drawing-room. I will go there
and await her.”
Vennaker was nervous, and only partially ob-
served the expression of surprise and apprehension
that came over Mrs. Evly’s face as she departed.
But he could not help noticing, as he entered the
room he so rarely visited now, that it had received
some new touches —flowers in the vases, some
ferns freshly watered, the music strewn about,
and the lid of the piano raised. He examined tli9
volume standing upon it—it was open at Bee-
thoven’s “Moonlight” sonata, a favorite of his.
He moved hastily away, and his heart beat
afresh as he heard a footstep in the hall, and in a
moment she stood before him. He saw the flush
on her cheek ; watched it fade into pallor ; and
noticed her manifest agitation as they faced and
looked at each other—constrained, uneasy, more
than strangers. She rested one hand on a chair-
back, and with the other crushed her gloves. A
sudden sense of the grief between them smote his
heart. He noticed too, that she wore her hat.
“You wish to see me, I understand,” she said,
faintly.
“Won’t you sit down?” he inquired, politely
placing a chair for her, and closing the door.
“Thank you,” she said, coldly, seating herself.
“I didn’t expect—l thought I should have left
before you ”
Vennaker slowly drew a chair, and sat facing
her. The formality of the thing was chilling
him.
“I returned—unexpectedly—earlier than I had
anticipated. . . I thought you would like to stay
with Minnie; I went away on purpose, so that
you could.”
“I am grateful,” she remarked, distantly. “ I
should not, of course, have remained otherwise.
Will you tell me why you sent for me ? I was
about to leave, and ”
Vennaker was fighting for time. He could not
marshal his thoughts, and he noticed that she was
becoming less perturbed than he.
“I saw you when you were here the night
before last,” he observed, with forced cheerful-
ness, “when you naturally expected to find me
asleep. It seemed a little like old times again ! ”
She flushed to her temples. “I—l felt uneasy
about the child ! I wouldn’t else have encroached
on my—time allowance —for seeing her,’ she
added, bitterly. “As for old times, pray don’t
refer to them —it is so unnecessary,” commencing
to draw on her gloves.
Vennaker colored slightly, as he said : “It
had not occurred to me that you were entirely
indifferent to them. It may perhaps, gratify you
if I admit that lam not. Amy ! I haven’t ceased
to love you, and I don’t like to see the child with-
out her mother. I know I divorced you—well,
you gave me sufficient cause, didn’t you ? Still,
I'm willing to forget that, and to re-marry you,
if you’ll return to me. That will establish you,
and .”
She rose, calmly, from her chair. “To receive
your forgiveness and pity ? ” she inquired, with a
little smile.
“Forgiveness—yes !” said Vennaker, earnestly,
standing before her—“ we’ll put pity on one side —
you wouldn’t have that, I know. But will it not
assuage any bitterness you may feel when I tell
you that no other woman, even now, could be the
same to me? I can’t forget the past —the old,
dear past —and I want to live it again ! I—l
didn’t think you could altogether cease to care for
me. Amy ! ” —and he attempted to take her
hand.
She drew back, quickly, and looked at him
wonderingly, and with pity. “Perhaps I
haven’t,” she said, sadly, “but do you not see
chat it is because of the happy past that there can
be no future for ns now ? ”
“Do you think I would ever upbraid you, if I
took you back?” exclaimed Vennaker, eagerly,
looking at her with the old admiration.
She shook her head, wistfully. “ No,” she said,
quietly. “ But you could not forget; and, even if
you did, I should fancy you thought of nothing
else. But the difficulty is my own —l could never
forget, or forgive myself! Don’t you see,” she
added, with strange pathos, “ that I’ve ruined my
own self-respect ? ”
Vennaker stood looking at her, and gloomily
reflecting on an aspect of the matter that had not
before occurred to him.
“Look here, Amy,” he said, slowly, “it was all
my own fault. I ought to have taken you to
England with me. I had no right to leave you
for six months, and think you were stronger than
I was myself. And supposing I had sinned
against you, as well as you against me, that would
make your mind easier about yourself, wouldn’t
it ? ”
“No ! ” she said, wearily, moving to the door.
“Wait!” he said, quickly; “it would! It
surely would ! —if I confess to you, Amy, I was—
although I loved you—unfaithful to you, in inten-
tion, before I left you, and that’s why I didn’t
take you ; and when I was in London. . . . Yes !
. . . Amy ! I ask you to forgive me ! ”
She drew herself up proudly, her hand on the
door. “ That makes it quite impossible we could
ever come together again,” she exclaimed, her
eyes flashing. “Even if I could forget my own
stain, I should despise you now. Why, you must
be a brute ! —and I—l was only weak, and yield-
ing. Did you not, even at parting, tell me of
your strength of character, and repeat your vows
of constancy ? ” And, with a contemptuous
glance, she opened the door and passed into the
hall.
“ But we are even now, aren’t we?” cried Ven-
naker, anxiously striding after her.
She broke into a peal of rippling laughter. . .
“Even? Yes, I suppose so, from your point o<.
view. But have you hated and despised yourself
for what you have done ? ” she exclaimed, turning
on him scornfully.
“No! ” he gasped—“ that is, not so far !’’
“I suppose not,” she said, scornfully, taking up
her sunshade; “and therein lies the difference
between us. But you revenged your—honor—
on me, you know,” she added, with satirical
soothing in her tone.
And as Vennaker stood, .pondering, the house
door closed smartly, and she was gone.

is the Test
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are sold by all Chemists

vill be posted on receipt of price by Poster-McClellan Co.
Pitt-street, Sydney.
The Testimony of Sydney people Stands the Test.
fJIHL test of time is what tells the tale. “
will it “wear well” is what interests most
A new broom sweeps clean,” but
The public soon find out when
misrepresentations are made, and merit alone will stand the test of time. Sydney
people appreciate merit, and many months ago local citizens publicly endorsed
They do so still. Would a citizen make the statement which follows unless con-
vinced that the article was just as represented ? A cure that lasts is the kind
that every sufferer from kidney ills is looking for.
FROM RANDWICK.
FROM BALMAIN.
Mr. W. Hibberd, St. Paul’s-street, Randwiek, this city,
says “ For years I have been a sufferer from backache. In
my work I have to stoop a good deal, and prolonged exertion
of this kind would double me up with pain. After stooping I
would be scarcely able to stand up straight again, but would
have to unbend gradually, and get the kinks out of my back.
I used many sorts of medicine for this ache, but with poor
success. The doctors I saw were also puzzled, I think. I
procured a box of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills at Newman’s
Pharmacy in King-street, and I am very pleased to tell you
that these pills gave me almost immediate relief. They went
right to the root of my trouble. The pains diminished after
further treatment, and at length totally disappeared. I shall
always recommend these pills for backache trouble.”
Twelve months later Mrs. Hibberd states:—-“It is now
more than a year ago since my husband used Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills for backache. lam now enabled to say that the
pills wrought a permanent cure in his case. The pains never
returned since. I can speak with conviction on the marvellous
way they acted in his case. He is very enthusiastic about the
pills, and i 3 always recommending them for such ailments as
the pills are meant for. He had been bad over ten years, so
you can see it is no common remedy that could cure him the
way Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills did.”
(t Mr. P. Smith, No. 1 Cheltenham-street, Balmain says -
Over twelve months ago I used Doan’s Backache Kidney
Bills for Kidney Trouble, and they worked a miracle in my
case. I had been under three doctors at different times but
their treatment did me no good. I used to be so bad that I
would have to be carried home in a cart if an attack came on
me when working, or when in the street. Sometimes when
walking I have been taken bad, and would be taken to the
hospital. My wife said she never expected I would live
through some of these bad turns. I suffered with a kind of
biliousness, vomiting egg-like stuff. My secretions were in a
irightful state. I could never bend iny back or move at all
vt len I had a bad turn. The people at the hospital gave me
medicines and recommended rubbing in liniments, but it was
no use; they did me no good. I saw an advertisement for
Uoar ! s Backache Kidney Pills, stating that these pills had
cured Mr. Dunn, and knowing him led me to procure this
remedy. I only took a short treatment, and they cured me.
ihe first dose reheved me. When I had finished them I
started work and have worked ever since. It is heavy work
lam doing, but it does not affect me. These pills cured me
after years of_ suffering, and the relief was almost instan-
taneous. I might state that since then I had an attack of
umbago, which laid me up one month, but I never thought
Uoan s Backache kidney Pills were good for this complaint.
en I remembered that I had a few in a box, and, not having
other medicine m the house, I tried them. They cured me.”
BUT BE SURE YOU
GET DOAN’S.
The Great City.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(Not Whitman—but the reality.)
The place where the Great City stands is not,
camarados, a place of admirable municipal
conveniences, or a place of peerless, primal
beauty ;
It is not a place of lofty dwellings, cleanly
appliances, and a passionate devotion to the
morning bath-tub ;
It is not, amigos, by any means, a centre of super-
nal culture ;
Neither is it a place where a freeborn populace is
deeply addicted to the use of soap and water.
The place where a great city stands is mostly a
conglomeration of cursed, unspeakable odors ;
It is a curious compound of fat aldermen, oily
politicians, casual coppers, and fragrant
Italian fish-hawkers ;
It is a place where the microbes wrestle for a living
in the fragrant, all-congenial gutter,
And where the Bacillus begets its many-million
brood on the trailing skirts of passing beauty.
The place where the Great City stands is not pre-
cisely a cradle for every shining virtue ;
The name of alderman is not synonymous—(not
always ) with honest administration ;
The fame of city-contracts is foul as the fame of
dismal Phlegethon,
And the odor of the city jobs rises thick, palpable,
perilous and pestful—a blight on the face of
common decency.
The place where the Great City stands is redolent
of stale beer, bad tobacco and the putrid
breath that pervades the dens of the slum
landlord ;
It is the nest of Phthisis ; the haunt of Typhoid ;
the resort of things unclean, of creeping pests
and Plague Bubonic;
It i 3 beloved of guttersnipes, sewer-rats, human
degenerates, and grinding rack-renters ;
It spits a cloud of smoke and grime to foul the
fair face of the kindly Heaven ;
It is mostly a modern Sodom—full ripe for a brim-
stone Deluge.
Five minutes in a century its fat Rulers stir up
various stinks and prate awhile of sanitation ;
They bray the poor in a mortar—and bray them-
selves in the Senate—
A race of queer, insensate, carnivorous Asses !
The Place where the Great City stands !—there is
no Great City, camarados !
This hideous jumble of garish beer-shops, gaping
gutters, busy bagnios, crowded gaols, dwarfish
men, and pallid women,
This melange of blaring brick and staring stucco
—one stately hall and a thousand squalid
hovels,
This steaming street-where scowling Greed and
prowling Need are ever present side by side,
Where the physical Impotent rubs, cheek by jowl,
with the mental Imbecile—
’Tis naught, I say, but a gaping asylum for
cripples, an hospital fraught with a myriad
diseases,
A home for the Seven Deadly Sins and the Seven
Cast-out Devils,—a Hell-broth brewed of
seventy deadly stenches—
But a Great City—never—never— never ! !
P. LUFTIG.
Why We Went.
A very great minority in Australia (writes Professor
Wood, of Sydney University, in Manchester Guardian),
consisting chiefly of Irish, the Labor Party, shearers and
rouseahouts, are opposed to the war. Racial unity and a
profundity of ignorance of the real causes of the war are,
the professor declares, the chief reasons of Australia’s
support. He also states that Che colonies consider their
help a good investment, and a good advertisement. A
few volunteers, he continues, are inspired by self-sacrifice,
but most have a sheer love of adventure and a desire to
escape from the monotony of bush life.— Cable.
Mr. Wood’s utterances have been most unguarded .
a very serious libel on a community who have proved
their loyalty and devotion to the Empire. . . . The very
small minority should subordinate their opinion to that
of the majority.— N.S. W. State Premier See.
The majority has exercised its power in such a
tyrannical way that many of the minority dare not ex-
press its views.— Prof. Wood.
It is time for notice to be taken of the Professor’s
action.—S.M. Herald.
It was a burst of truest loyalty, a mighty impulse that
stirred us, a love of country, Queen and Empire.— A
volunteer.
* * * *
There’s been a lot of blather about Aus-
tralians who went to the war, and I think it’s
about “up to me” to chip in. I express the
sentiments of mates, acquaintances, and others
who left the North-west; and I know of cookies
and selectors’ sons in other parts who were actuated
by the same impulses. While admitting that
many went from ideas of “racial unity,” well-
founded or mistaken ; through disinterested
patriotism for the sake of the “Imperialism”
ingrained into the very fibre of their beings during
childhood in public schools, conducted by Britain-
born teachers; while others went, more or
less, through compulsion—sacrificed by “loyal”
parents, employers, and so on, clingingto the silken
bonds that are myths to them ; from ignorance
—from a hundred causes ; let me say that we had
very interested personal reasons for going,
* • * *
We weren’t stirred by any bursts of “loyalty,”
or the love of Queen or Empire. We were in-
different enough about those things before ; now
we’re utterly sick of the names. We may be loyal
enough : If Australia wanted Independence to-
morrow we’d fall over one another in our eagerness
to fight for her. That’s where our Patriotism
comes in. Yet we fought in a war that didn’t
personally concern us ; we helped to crush a game
little people that dared to fight for what we our-
selves would fight for ! The Boer was a stranger;
we had only a vague idea what he was being
kicked for ; but we loyally volunteered to go and
jump on him all the same. The good old Empire
called, we showed our loyalty . . . Love
Queen . . . Silken Bonds—Bah ! This is why we
yent.
> . lc J' ure a lonel y station in the drought-stricken
back-blocks; the same monotonous round of work
from year’s end to year’s end ; burning suns,
thirst, dust, flies; the never-gratified craving for
the sight and voice of a woman ; the only fresh
face that of a passing swagman ; seeing our fellows
commit suicide in despair (two from a station I
worked on near Tibooburra hanged themselves in
one year); or become eccentric, to be known as
Hatty Mick, Barmy Bill and Looney Jim. What
would we not do to escape such a hell ?
* * * *
As station-hands we get at the best a pound a
week, the roughest of tucker, and the meanest of
hovels to sleep in ; but plenty of work—seven
days a week of it. Out boundary-riding we are
lucky to get 15 bob a week and rations—Blb. of
cheap flour, 10 of stale mutton, 2 of black sugar,
and a £lb. of post-and-rail tea. To satisfy our
craving for vegetables we search the creek banks
and billabongs for pig-weed. The tent is pitched
m a clump of mulga, where a new face is seldom,
if ever, seen; where the only sounds come from
crows and dying sheep ; where we sit at night
staring into the fire, or talking to Fancies in the
smoke-wreaths ; imagining adventures, longing
for love and life, dreaming of women ; or we lie
on a blanket spread on the ground, or in a bag-
bunk, reading “Deadwood Dicks” and stale
weekly papers by a slush lamp, till we are worked
into a frenzy, sharing the hero’s wondrous fights
and adventures, yearning to be—well, anything to
kill the loneliness that damns existence.
* * * ft
Day by day we ride round the same old fences,
dodder about after perishing sheep, trying to keep
old ewes from dying, and seeing them die in spite
of everything. What more hopeless and heart-
breaking job could a man tackle? The stubborn
old things hang on the fences, poke into the
furthest corners, miles away from the tank, and
you start in the morning to drive them to water,
and by pushing, whipping, shoving and kicking
through heat, flies, everlasting dust, and periodic
dust-storms, you get half of them to the tank by
sundown—to see them bog, and spend half the
night pulling them out.
* » * *
You repeat this every day for months, leaving a
few behind each trip, and strewing your track
with lambs that you have knocked on the head.
You shout and yell till you are hoarse, and feel as
if you had strangled your windpipe and strained
your lungs; you curse all things woolly; the
sweat pours from you in streams, and your
head feels as though a little hell had got inside of
it. Elies buzz round you in millions, and when
the wind blows you are blinded and choked with
dust. Your dog is done-in with the heat long
before noon, and merely dodges "from shade to
shade, a long way behind ; your water-bag runs
dry, and by-and-bye you scrape the mucous coat-
ing off your lips to prevent the dust banking up,
and damming up the entrance to your innards for
ever. To cap all, when you start for “home,”
your horse is exhausted, and you have either to
drag him to the station, or let him go, and carry
your saddle on your back.
* • • *
In the midst of this hell-life came the call for
volunteers. From boundary-fence to boundary-
fence the news went, and we cheered for the
mother country, the good old Empire. Sitting
before our lonely campfires, with the memory of
first contingents, what glories that trip promised,
what temptations it held ! A smart uniform,
nothing to do but carry a gun, a trip to Sydney,
crowds hurrahing, bands, flags, girls to hug and
kiss—sweet, dainty girls ! —a long, delightful sea-
trip, new sights, new countries, more crowds,
bands, more lovely women, life-stirring adven-
tures on the veldt, promotion, a thousand-to-one
show of being shot, the chance of snavelling a good
section of Boer land, and Jive bob a day all the
time! Do you ask us why we went? "Do you
wonder that we did not consider the pros and cons,
but whooped with the Empire and the daily
papers, and rushed for places ?
• * * *
We went —and were sickened with the sights of
suffering women and dying children, of hardships
and wide-spread misery. We came back, a lot of
us, and applied for a promised Government billet;
looked for any kind of billet. Nothing for it but
to return to boundary-riding, or respond to the
Empire’s call again. The roads were waterless
and barren ; so we couldn’t ride back; we must
shoulder bluey, and chance perishing on the way;
also chance getting a job. On the other hand,
the Empire offered a sure five bob a day (riches !),
clothes, tucker, horses, arms, a pleasant trip.
* * * *
Well, for my personal part, the offers went beg-
ging ; there’s no place like Australia. But many
whom I knew, after battling around till their
money was done, and dreading more than ever the
monotony of bush life, after they had once tasted
of cities and glory and girls, and the spirit of
adventure was fired, showed “their loyalty to
the dear old Empire ” once more. Had America,
or any other country, perhaps, called for volun-
teers under the same conditions, they would have
answered just as readily. As before stated, I
speak for myself, and for those with whom I am
personally intimate.
* * * *
Many crossed the water from pure love of
adventure ; some were really stirred by a burst of
loyalty and love of the Empire. But take away the
change from the dreariness of out-back, leaving
naked loyalty on her merits, and Australia’s con-
tribution would have been small. It would not
have dragged us from our back-block runs. But
the change, the relief from the dead monotony of
bush life, was there —and that’s why most of us
went.
A BUSHMAN.
Writes “Neptune ” :
Australian dairy-farmers will have to get a “ two-bit ”
move on if they want to keep their claws on London
butter market. The latest competitor for this trade is
Siberia, containing vast areas of dairying and arable land,
which the Russian Govt., with an eye to future trade-
prospects, is practically giving away to intending emi-
grants. Loans are also made on easy terms to settlers, to
enable them to get machinery, Stock, and farming
requisites. John Foster Fraser, who recently described
his trans-Siberian railway tour, states that every Eastern-
bound train from European Russia is crammed with
emigrants, and asserts that Siberia, with its ever-certain
rainfall, is destined to become the srreat wheat-producing
country of the world. The Yankees have already
recognised this fact, for their agricultural machinery
drummers are to be met with in every town in Siberia.
With an improved train-service, journey from Vladivo-
stok, on the East, to Riga, the port of shipment in the
West, will be made in about 17 days ; thence to London,
another four days, giving the Siberian farmer a transit
period of 21 days as compared with our 50-day passages.
The Russian Govt, also, it is stated, contemplates the
establishment of dairy schools and laboratories in various
districts, provision of cool-storage at principal railway
centres, quick train-service from Siberia to the Baltic sea-
board, and quick steamer-servica from Riga to London.
These items would form a good working programme for
our own agricultural dept*., whose time seems mostly
spent in persuading each other’s experts to swap States.
