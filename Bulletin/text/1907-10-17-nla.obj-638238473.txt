MAETERLINCK
THE RED PAGE
IT is questionable whether the world has
lost or gained by the transformation of
the Maeterlinck of the symbolic drama
to the Maeterlinck of modern philosophy.
Would we willingly give up The Life of the
Bee for Pelleas and Melisande ? Probably if
Maeterlinck could have continued his
dramatic work, perfecting and refining
its strange beauties, we would have been
well content without Wisdom and Destiny ;
but the frail, naive beauty of his earlier
drama was but spoiled and coarsened when
he added to it strength. Monna Vanna is a
fine play, richly embroidered with romance,
reverberant with the clash of arms, suffused
with human emotion, deliberately dramatic;
but its appeal is cruder, its grace lost be-
neath the riot of passion. Maeterlinck
brought his characters out of the twilight
into the day ; it was no longer they who
were the passive instruments of fate ; he
flung destiny into the background and made
his people articulate,. self-sufficient. The
result was a piece of the theatre—and he
had shown us a visionary beauty. Maeter-
linck had grown up. He deliberately closed
the door of fantasy and adventured into
medieval romance. He shocked us into
applause, but the ghostly thrill had gone.
Then he woke and saw the world with the
vision of a man. And his eyes, once accus-
tomed to the glare, saw everywhere curious
and stimulating things. Everywhere life, in
its least articulate, least pretentious manifes-
tations charmed and intrigued him; he
became the philosopher of modernity. And
in his essays the old charm survived ; but
now, instead of being half in love with
easeful death, he became enamored with life.
He wrote of the bee, of Shakespeare, of the
fist, of the perfume of flowers, of the motor
car. He had passed from the shadows of
his forest of fantasy into the crisp, crude,
palpitating world of science. And in this
later phase of his there is still the naive
outlook of the wondering child.
jt
His latest volume of essays, Life and
Flowers (Gr. Allen, per Sydney Book Club),
has the stimulating and suggestive charm of
his earlier work. His criticism of life is
always incisive, his analogies and dreams
always logically based. And he is not with-
out the saving-grace of humor.
Let us not sav to ourselves that the best
truth always lies in moderation, in the decent
average. The average, the decent moderation of
to-day will be the least human of things to-
moirow. At the time of the Spanish Inquisition,
the opinion of good sense and of the just medium
was certainly that people ought not to burn too
large a number of heretics; extreme and unreason-
able opinion obviously demanded that they should
burn none at all. It is the same to-day with the
question of marriage, of love, of religion, of crimi-
nal justice. At the present moment, the most
reasonable opinion on the subject of the social
question invites us to do all that we can gradually
to diminish inevitable inequalities, and distribute
happiness more equitably. Extreme opinion de-
mands instantly integral division, the suppression
of property; obligatory labor, and the rest. We
do not yet know how these demands will be
realised ; but it is already quite certain that very
simple circumstances will one day make them
appear as natural as the suppression of the right
nobd?ty 0f?emtUre ° r ° f the privile S es of the
His standpoint toward nature is that of
the modern scientist. The belief in the
infallibility of nature has gone into the limbo
• * s ,VP® r i st . itions alon g with a host of other
infallibilities. Maeterlinck sees Nature’s
mistakes, and suggests their cause. He
notes that Nature, in her most constant and
familiar manifestations, very rarely acts
according to human good sense.
W bat could be more senseless than her waste
of existences? What more unreasonable than
those billions of germs blindly squandered to
achieve the chance birth of a single being ? What
more illogical than the useless complication of
her means (as, for instance, in the life of certain
parasites and the impregnation of flowers bv
insects) to attain the simplest ends ? All this
goes beyond our good sense, and shows it that it is
not in agreement with general life, and that it is
almost isolated in the universe.
j*
Yet he finds that, after all, Nature is no
more stupid than Man. * '
Hie genius of the earth, which is probably that
of the whole world, acts, in the vital struggle
exactly as a man would act. It employs the same
methods, the same logic. It attains its aim by
the same that we would use ; it gropes it
hesitates, it corrects itself time after time * it
adds, it suppresses, it recognises and repairs its
errors, as we should do in its place. It makes
great efforts, it invents with difficulty and little
by little, after the manner of the workmen and
engineers in our workshops. It fights like our-
selves against the heavy, huge and obscure mass
of its being. It knows no more than we do
whither it is going; it seeks and finds itself
gradually. It has an ideal that is often confused,
but one in which, nevertheless, we distinguish a
host of great lines that rise towards a more
ardent, complex, nervous and spiritual form of
existence. ... Does this not mean that the
methods of the human mind are the only possible
methods, that man has not erred, that he is
neither an exception nor a monster, but the being
hrough whom pass, in whom are most intensely
manifested the great volitions, the great desires
of the universe?... It would not, I imagine,
be very bold to maintain that there are
not any more or less intelligent beings,
but a scattered general intelligence, a sort
of universal fluid that penetrates diversely the
organisms which it encounters according as they
are good or bad condubtors of the understanding.
Man would then represent, until now, upon this
earth the mode of life that offered the least resist-
ance to this fluid, which the religious called
divine. Our nerves would be the threads along
which this more subtle electricity would spread.
Ihe circumvolutions of our brain would, in a
manner, form the induction-coil in which the
force of the current wotild be multiplied : but this
current would be of no other would pro-
ceed from no other source than that which passes
through the stone, the star, the flower or the
animal.
In his detailed treatment of this theme, in
that interesting essay “The Intelligence of
the Flowers, Maeterlinck calls our attention
to some remarkable instances of this uni-
versal intelligence working through the
flowers. He shows us that the vegetable
world, which to us seems so placid, so
resigned, is one in which impatience and the
revolt against destiny are the most vehement
and stubborn. The plant lies under the
heavy ban of immobility from birth to death.
Against this law it strives with a remarkable
persistence.
It exerts itself wholly with one sole aim : to
escape above from the fatality below, to set itself
free, to invent or invoke wings, to escape as far as
as it can, to conquer the space in which destiny
encloses it, to approach another kingdom, to
Penetrate into a moving and active world. . . .
We shall see. that the flower sets man a prodigious
example of insubmission, courage, perseverance,
and ingenuity.
So, with wonderful instances of the in-
genuity of the flowers, Maeterlinck fills in
his suggestion of the kinship between man
and the dumb intelligences of the lower
kingdoms. Ideas seem almost to come to
the flowers in the same way that they come
to us. They grope in the same darkness,
encounter the same obstacles ; they have the
same disillusions, the same triumphs; they
seem to possess our patience, our perseve-
rance, our self-love ; thdy struggle, like our-
selves, against a great indifferent force that
ends by assisting them. Their inventive
imagination not only follows the same pru-
dent and minute methods, the same tiriuw,
narrow, and winding paths ; it also has un-
expected leaps and bounds that suddenly
fix definitely an uncertain discovery. Natu-
rally enough, Maeterlinck fixes upon the
orchids as the most remarkable inventors
of the vegetable race ; and his whole elabo-
rate essay is a plea that the flower possesses
the power, or the intelligence, to adapt
itself to changing circumstances, which we
call evolution. Incidentally he mentions the
rational behavior of the thrifty black bee
when transported to Australia.
After one or two years, finding that summer is
perpetual and flowers for ever abundant, she will
live from day to day, content to gather the honey
and pollen indispensable for the day’s consump-
tion ; and her recent and thoughtful observation
triumphing over hereditary experience, she will
cease to make provision for her winter
J*
Maeterlinck points out that it may be
necessary to experiment with flowers for
many years before we can prove their adapta-
tion to changed circumstances—such as sub-
stituting one class of inseet for another and
seeing what changes the flowers would make
in the structure of tfteir fertilising machinery
visited by the new-comers. Yet his view
that flowers do show the intelligence neces-
sary to meet unforseen circumstances is
obviously more than probable. For instance,
the flowers came upon this earth before the
arrival of insects. The appearance of the
insects was seized upon by the flowers in a
way that undoubtedly suggests a keen prac-
ticality and an invention and courage suffi-
ciently remarkable. But, on the larger
question, as the evolution of man and of
atoms is now established, it is certain
that the orders m between follow the same
course. We may figure Nature as a rather
stupid but very persistent chemist, always
almost haphazardly experimenting, and—like
the Federal Labor Party—intent only on the
immediate concerns of her creatures, and
with a hazy idea of whither her efforts will
lead them. Atom, or algae, or crystal, plant,
or bee, or man, Nature is for ever restlessly
at work through all, reaching out into a
higher complexity of life, a greater chance
of greatly living.
Arthur. Streeton leaves for England to-dav
wel provisioned for his next attack upon the art-
world of London. Australia has been appreciative
of the work of her returned son ; he must have
I works aggregating three thousand
pounds in value. Ihere is a moral here for our
expatriate Australian artists. Streeton’s last
show in Melbourne put £350 into his pocket—for
value received.
THE SYMBOLIST.
I sometimes think the rose is red,
I sometimes think it's green ;
I sometimes think the cauliflower
Is the finest thing I’ve seen.
I sometimes think the world is round,
I sometimes think it’s flat ;
I sometimes think the symbolist
Is talking through his hat !
W. A. OSBORNE
in “ The Laboratory and
Other Poems.”
COLLOLDS AND GATALYSTS
f INHERE is certainly something to be
said for W. A. Osborne, author
of The Laboratory and Other
Poems, charmingly printed by T.
0. Lothian, Melb. He has the gift of
sonorous phrase, and sometimes he has a
thought behind the phrase, and he is com-
mendably shy of roses and dawns and gloam-
ings. In his striving to be modern he occa-
sionally becomes but a parody of Bernard
O Dowd ; but as Bernard O’Dowd sometimes
parodies himself Osborne may be forgiven.
Evidently O’Dowd is founding a school, and,
so far, Osborne is his prize pupil. Still,
even O’Dowdism is better than. Tennysonism,
for O’Dowd acridly stings, while Tennyson
merely cloys. The opening verses of The
Laboratory admirably shows Osborne’s
method :
We live amid the buzzing flames
That from our bunsens fly,
The measured tube, the seamless bulb,
And rippling mercury.
The prisoned rainbow waits on us,
The trapped aurora glows,
And from the Ruhmkorff terminals
The vibrant lightning flows.
This is our furnished factory,
There are the gleaming tools
With which we fashion or unlock
The dancing molecules;
By them we rivet complexes
By Nature never seen ;
By them we cut entanglements
Of cumbrous protein.
*Tis here we scrawl the formulae
That ope the stores of earth,
Or cryptic hexagons that bring
A commerce into birth.
And here within the hissing tubes
Our tiny search-light’s source,
Which yet may outline and reveal
The mystery of force.
And so amid no haughty pomp,
No gaudy flag unfurled,
Our fingers wander lovingly
On switchboards of the world.
But, in his endeavor to be crisp, Osborne
frequently becomes forced. His similes
become far-fetched, and they are often
commonplace when fetched. As examples:
The solar breeze blows fresh astern ;
Our strenuous youths and maids
Go gladly up and square the yards
To catch the ether trades. . . .
To discipline bacteria,
To guide the comet’s flight,
To hammer out the molecule,
Or blast a satellite. . . .
Each works but for the common weal,
Each other each assists.
When on the colloids drifting by
They loose the catalysts.
It may be all right for the catalysts, but it
seems hard luck for the colloids. And,
despite Osborne’s aptitude for the sonorous
phrase he hardly knows yet how to manage
his words. Thus, in a sonnet upon “An
Old Map of Assyria,” he spoils his sestette
by a “ rocky ” ending :
Ah they are dead, .their glory passed away ;
Yet, oft I hear in unforgetful sleep,
The din of multitudinous chariots drawn
Through surging streets of lordly Nineveh,
And mingled myriads, voiceful in the deep
Roar of irrevocable Babylon.
Osborne is promising. . . ,

“N.L.”: In the article on “English Prosody’
(“Red Page,” 19/9/’O7), mention of the metrica
irregularities in Christina Rossetti’s verse recalls
the well-meaning Ruskin’s effort, fortunately un
successful, to induce her to use “ standard ” verse
methods. In 1861 Dante Rossetti left his sister’s
manuscript poems with Ruskin, whose comment
forms portion of a letter published in Buskin-
Bossctti-Preraphnelitism (George Allen, 1899) :
I sate up till late last night reading poems.
1 hey are full of beauty and power. But no
publisher—l am deeply grieved to know this—
would take them, so full are they of quaintnesses
and offences. Irregular measure (introduced to
my great regret, in its chief wilfulness, by Cole-
ridge) is the calamity of modern poetry. The
Iliad, the Divina Commedia, the TEneid, the
whole of Spenser, Milton, Keats aie written
without taking a single license or violating the
common ear for metre ; your sister should exercise
herself in the severest commonplace of metre
until she can write as the public like. Then if
she puts in her observation and passion all will
become precious. But she must have the Form
first.” The advice was not taken, and in the
following year many of the poems, issued in Miss
Rossetti’s first publicly-circulated volume of verse,
proved to be what a large percentage of the public
dtd like, Possibly the judgment of present-day
restnctionists on the point of popularity will
prove to be as defective as Ruskin’s.
The recogni tion that—with the modern methods
ot photography which afford the photographer
ample opportunity to express his individuality—
photography is an art has called forth a number of
books upon the work of the camera. Of these,
one or the most stimulating is Art and the Camera,
by Anthony G-uest (George Bell). The work is
written for the amateur—the professional is
usually hopelessly beyond the pale of art: but
there is no technical mention of processes; the
critic is solely concerned with the artistic effect
and the universal principles underlying its attain-
ment. Guest has no. hesitation in pronouncing
photography an art. Artistic photography he
dehnes as “the correction of the mistakes of the
camera, and the vivifying of its productions by
human emotion.... When photography is solely
the work of the sun and the camera, finished off
by the operation of certain chemical laws, it car
by no possibility be an art. When it is the pro-
duction of the same agents modified by unin-
spired manipulation, it is still outside the pale.
But when the individual is in control of the
operation throughout, insisting on the attainment
of his ideal, and preventing any appearances that
he does not want, then, be the medium what it
may, it holds the possibility of producing a work
of art. ... The ‘ pure photography ’ standpoint
is open to objection, for the camera’s work needs
milch correction before it can claim to be artistic,
and whether that correction be applied through
the technical resources peculiar to photography
seems to matter very little. On the whole, pro-
bably, the hand, as the most immediate instru-
ment of the br.ain, offers the surest means of
carrying out its behests. A photograph
should be a photograph first of v all, and its
modification or beautification by other means
should be regarded as subsidiary. The true
theory is that the process to which a material is
subjected should beautify it, not obliterate its
character.” Art and the Camera is written from
this sane standpoint, aiid the numerous illustra-
tion of artistic work, though necessarily losing
much from reproduction upon smooth surfaces,
are highly artistic in quality. It is a pity, how-
ever, that Guest has not included in his survey
some examples from those European workers whose
work is so outstanding among the artists of the
camera.
0. 0. Oabot sends this stanza of Henry Parkes,
deceased, from the inexpressible Douglas Brooke
Wheelton Sladen’s unspeakable Australian “An-
thology,” as possessing a present fitness :
Oh, for some awakening cause
Where we face eternal laws,
Where we dare not turn aside,
Where the souls of men are tried—
Something of a nobler strife,
Which consumes the dross of life,
To unite to truer aim,
To exalt to loftier fame.
Leave behind the bats and balls,
Leave the racers in the stalls,
Leave the cards for ever shuffled,
Leave the yachts on seas unruffled,
Leave the haunts of pampered ease,
Leave your dull festivities ;
Better far the savage glen—
Fitter school for earnest men.

OUR SAUSAGE SERIAL
This serial must stop. It is wrecking the
Federal Constitution. From all over the
Commonwealth reports are coming in of girls
named Alice running amok. The life of a red-
whiskered constable or a Customs officer or a pine-
apple is not for one moment safe, earthquakes and
explosions are endemic, and Carruthers (not the
dog) has resigned. The only exciting thing
that so far hasn’t happened is a chasm, and
when even the missing will has turned up a
chasm may be expected at any moment. So, in
the interests of lawnorder, this serial must con-
clude. The final chapter, already written, will
appear next week. The author of this week’s
chapter is N. Edmond, Mount Royal, Strathfield.
The Trend That Didn’t.
(By the “ Red Page," Hunt Coleman, J. M.
Leape, H. Paton, “ Anon,’’ R. C. Batchelor ,
H. S. Mitchell, and N. Edmond.)
Chapter vm.—An Assortment.
Alice and Charles, who were now growing old,
were seated with their hands round each other’s
neck, discussing the non-appearance of the missing
will. ,Tust then a violent explosion shook the
place, and something crashed down the chimney.
It was thfe missing will.
J ust as Charles was about to peruse it, Alice
uttered a blood-curdling shriek, and pointed a
shaking finger at the window.
Horrors ! It was the face at the window.
“Goodness!” cried Alice, “it must be the
missing child.”
It was the missing child.
It entered, staggering under the weight of three
huge volumes of Chaucer.
“Ha!” yelled Alice, “there are the forged
marriage lines.”
Charles turned pale, but soon turned back
, again.
“What’s the signature?” he demanded in a
shaky voice.
“They are marked with the sign of the faded
flannel-flower.”
“ The game’s up !” cried he, throwing off his
mask.
There stood John Blaclcadder, with nine pistols
in each hand, and two in his teeth. Just then a
roll of wire-netting, covered with gore, hurtled
through the window.
“ Too late ! ” cried a Customs officer, as he took
John in charge.
Alice was saved.
(To be concluded.)

THE EVIDENCE AND REASON WHY
ALIFE
SAVED
The Evidence
23 Burton St., Caruperdowii,N.S.W.,
July 13th, 1906.—“ At the age of four
my son Sidney was operated upon
for rupture. He then contracted
wasting disease, and was only
skin and bone; we thought he
was dying. Almost broken-
hearted, I sent for a bottle of
Scott’s Emulsion, and before it was
half finished the dysentery stopped;
the boy was much easier and slept
well, and now, after only three
bottles, he is just as far off death
as he once was near it. He is so
fat that he can hardly walk. I
consider that Scott’s Emulsion
saved my child’s life.”
(Mrs.) A. ALLERTON
The Reason Why
Life was Saved
The purity, vigour and
digestibility of Scott’s place
it far ahead of all other
emulsions in healing and
nourishing power. No ex-
pense is spared to make it
the best of its kind, and
this is why results like the
above are achieved each
year.
It is easy to
make sure of get-
ting Scott’s: see
‘the fishman
with fish ” on the
package, and
know that you
will obtain just as
gratifying results.,

Laughter.
To-day young Genius drank his wine
In a shady glen with a host divine.
And, chucking the chin of his favorite Muse,
Mirthfully told them thus the news :
“Ho ! ho! I laugh with a joyous laugh
At those who have written my epitaph,
“ And, under the pall of a century’s lays,
Have buried me deep in the olden days.
“ There’s Dead-in-Earnest, the critic man—
The eminent ‘ I ’ of the graveyard clan—
“ Last night he mourned through a vigil long,
So I sought him out in a myall song—
-44 A simple thing from the heart of Time
A laughing riot in lilting rhyme ;
“ ‘Um ! ah ! ’ he said, as he faced me there.
' Ahem ! er ! yes ! Now, that is fair.
“ * One almost feels that the verses sing;
And yet—it is only a lightsome thing.
“ ‘And yet—and yet’ With a bound I sought
His inner self as a happy thought.
“ And he saw me throned in a thousand lays
He had damned before in his graveyard craze.
“ And he wrote— 4 ’Tis true in the world’s wide
range
That nothing dies, but that all things change ;
“ 4 And swords of famine, and gouts of blood,
And emotions running at fever flood
44 4 Shall change and change till the bloody past
Evolve in the Laughter-Life at last. ’
“ But lo 1 I laugh with a joyous Lugh
At those who have written my epitaph,
44 And, under the pall of a century’s lays,
Have buried me deep in the olden days;
44 For Dead-in-Earnest, this morn, arose
And wrote afresh in his graveyard prose.”
And the Lost laughed : 44 Ha! in the world’s wide
range
All things, all things but the critics change.”

Godly Folks!
What ails the godly folks around ? They sneer as
passers-by,
And oft methinks I see them glint the corner of
an eye;
Maybe’tis just because a year agone—my heart
was light—
I loved a goodly lover—yes ! I loved too well one
night!
I felt so lonely from thenceforth, for conscience
bade him flee;
Love’s captive, chained to stand the gibes, I stayed
while he was free.
Then came the travail and the tears—and joy
when baby cried ;
Then sorrow knocked and broke my heart, the
dawn my darling died !
What ails the godly folks around ? They tilt their
noses high,
And pass this bit of bitter flesh with heavy groan
and sigh ;
They quite forget how Mother Eve in ages past
would taste,
And put the ban upon the crowd through her un-
seemly haste !
I would not blame the godly crew if they would
but afford
To hurl a stone, or brush aside the teachings of
their Lord ;
Since God is Love, and Love’s not sin, yet loving
brings us pain,
Methinks the godly, when we fall, might help us
up again !

On the Cliffs.
I knelt upon the cliffs last night— ten thousand
drifting stars
Kept vigil and the vestal light knelt down and
kiss’d the bars;
The night wind came and knelt with me; in
yawning depths beneath
The dark tongue of a mighty sea showed grim
between its teeth.
I knelt upon the cliffs last night, and yearned for
endless rest;
I longed to toss on breakers white, to sleep on
Neptune’s breast.
Alone, I thought, with watching trees, while
planets blazed above,
I longed within my soul to claim the sea’s eternal
love.
But as I knelt forlorn, afraid, a figure glided by
That tarried not, but leapt out wide with harsh,
exultant cry. ...
The night wind whimpered in the crags, and
whined among the trees ;
Old Ocean’s organs pealed their deep and un-
changed harmonies.
I left the lonely cliffs last night with coward
heart, afraid,
For far below on beaches white a mangled corpse
was laid. . . .
The sea gave neither love nor rest; with garments
trailed and torn
That corpse bore on its pulseless breast the spume
of Ocean’s scorn.

How to Address Betters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the paper
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for “ copy.” Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.

THE SWEATED JOBS OF ENGLAND.
A few months ago the London Daily Mail got
up an exhibition of Britain’s sweated industries —
the chronically-sweated ones which live, as a
regular thing, on the flesh and bones of the
people—and sent the horror travelling around the
country. The authenticity of the monster was
sworn to by the Mail and by many other
authorities, and it was never disputed in any
detail. A duplicate exhibition was sent out to
Maoriland, and served as a side issue of the recent
big show at Christchurch. It consisted simply of
a collection of articles, made or partly made, with
an accusing statement alongside each, setting
forth the wages which the worker receives, and
the number of hours per day or per week that it is
necessary for that worker to labor to earn a plank
and a crust. The catalogue is a huge one—it seems
as if the sweated industry was the rule rather
than the exception in Freetrade Britain.
* * * *
It is amazing and incredible to consider what
an alleged human being can live upon in
Bull’s country. Not that England is a cheap
country ; to live there as an ordinary Australian
workman and his family live would cost more in’
many cases than that Australian workman could
earn. The price of fresh meat alone would be
liable to knock him out in one round. But the
art of crowding many people into one room and
making it serve for all purposes; of dis-
pensing with meat, fish, butter, cheese, jam,
fresh air, amusement, exercise and many
other things; and of keeping a scanty
wardrobe together more by accident and the
intervention of Providence than by any recog-
nised means —these things have become an
art in the land of Cobden. Life in many
trades is a matter of four main propositions:
bread, weak tea, 16 hours work, and eight hours
sleep.' So the mystery of that crude kind of cheap-
ness which comes of low-priced labor is explained.
In the making of match-boxes, for instance, the
English working day is mentioned as 16 hours, and
the earnings of an expert worker are 9s. per
week, out of which he has to find paste and string.
At carding hooks and eyes the working day
is 14 hours, and the average earnings are 3s. 3d.
a week. The worker finds cotton and needles,
which take 4d. out of the wretched pittance,
so that the wild affluence at the end of the
week really boils down to 2s. lid. Carding
buttons runs to 3s. 6d. a week (15 hours per day),
chough pearl buttons bring in higher remunera-
tion ; sometimes the giddy altitude of 7s. a
week is attained. The worker finds needles and
thread. At making helmet chains for the head-
gear of soldiers, firemen, and policemen 10s. a
week can be made by working eighteen hours a
day, from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. (It seems that each
branch of sweating has its customs, built up during
a long course of hereditary misery, so that there
are recognised 14- and 15- and 16-hour trades, and
soon.) Paper-bag making, which is a machine
industry here, and pays young women from 13s. 6d.
to £1 a week for perhaps 45 hours, is largely a hand
industry in Freetrade England, just as the making
of the dilly-bag is among our aborigines, and 12
hours daily work returns 4s. 6d. a week, less cost
of paste and alum. Artificial flower making
yields 7s. to 10s. a week, less about 2s. 3d. for
sundries, for 10J hours daily work, but it takes
five years to thoroughly learn the trade. Chain-
making pays the woman-toiler about 7s. per week
for 12 hours daily toil. From 2s. Bd. to 6s. per
week can be made “capping” and carding
safety-pins. Curiously enough, while industries
that yield as little as 3s. 6d. a week live
and flourish in Freetrade England, nailmaking
is dying out for want of workers; the cata-
logue says briefly that “ parents refuse to
bring up their children to so wretched a prospect.”
Considering the horror of the other prospects this
prospect must be something incredible.

Still the catalogue goes on its interminable way.
Sacksvieldfis. to 6s. 3d. perweek, less cost of needles,
etc., and the woman has either to carry the sacks
(in 561 b. bundles) from the factory and back, or
pay 2d. porterage. The making of pom-poms,
whatever they may be, returns ss. 6d. a week.
The folding of prayer-books and of the holy and
blessed Scripture returns as much as 9s. fid. a
week, for 16 hours daily labor, and the callous,
dead, withered, dried-up church doesn’t care.
Colored tassels yield 7d. per gross ; and furniture
gimp lid. per dozen yards. The umbrella business
runs as high as 10s. per week, for 10 hours per
day ; and ladies’ shoes go as far as 6s. per week.
There are 188 sweated trades on the list, and so far
this enumeration has only got as far as No. 20. It is
only possible to quote a few samples at random out
of the other 168. Buttons return 6s. 9d. per week;
toothbrushes, Bs. or 9s. per week (12 hours per
day); boys’ knickerbockers, l|d. each (equal to
about 9s. per week, the worker paying for her
own thread and sewing machine out of this);
sailor suits, 13s. 6d. per week for 15 hours work
per day, worker finding machine and thread ; also
children’s boots yield 7s. fid. to Bs. 6d. net per
week for something like 16 hours daily toil. The
price has been reduced one-half within the last
few years. (In Maoriland this work is paid at
about Is. per hour.) Then in Freetrade England
waistcoats are made for Id. each, the worker
finding the thread. Men’s trousers yield as
much as 7s. 6d. per week for 16 hours
daily struggle (the Maoriland rate for women
in this industry is 255. a week working
hours per day.) Shirts return about 9s. 6d. per
week for from 12 to 17 hours work per diem.
Coats are a gorgeous item, and pay as much a.s
14s. per week to an expert. Blouses pay a divi-
dend of about -Bs. a week net to a clever worker
with her own machine. Nightdresses pan out for
9s. 6d. per week ; bed-spreads, Bs. 3d. ; children’s
frocks, Bs.; ladies’ belts, ss. per week, assuming
the hours to be 16 per day ; skirts, about 10s. per
week (15 hours per day); underclothing, about 7s.
per week. But the catalogue grows too monoto-
nous, and further details are dropped. It is a
very long catalogue, and according to Australian
ideas it should have been much longer. For
instance, the skilled carpenter, though his wages
in some parts get down below sd. an hour, doesn’t
rank in the United Kingdom as the representative
of a sweated industry. He is simply an ordinary
case.
* * * #
If any further argument were needed in favor
of High Protection, the fixing of a decent standard
of wages in all trades by Wages Boards or Arbi-
tration Courts, the breaking up of great estates,
and the exclusion of cheap undesirables, the Ex-
hibition of Britain’s sweated industries is that
argument. It isn’t as if the evil were a small one;
in one way and another sweated industries keep a
good twelve millions of the British people on the
very brink of starvation. Britain is reckoned to
have more wealth per head than any other country
on earth, but so long as Freetrade lasts it is hard
to see how that wealth is going to do any good to
the sweated industries. Rather it tends to
aggravate their case. In a rich country living
is usually expensive, and it is distinctly
expensive in England. To take the single item
of rent, in one of the miserable rabbit warrens of
London —a tenement which holds in itself the
population of a village—a single room about the
dimensions of a boot-trunk costs something like
£lO a year. Yet under Freetrade the occupant
has to make things just as cheaply as any foreigner
who can get equally good accommodation for £3 ;
and there are cheaper foreigners even than that.
And if the wages were compulsorily raised, the only
result, while Freetrade lasted, would be that all
the work which could be sent abroad would go
abroad. The mild Hindu, living in a village
shack that costs perhaps £1 a year, in a climate that
makes for great economy of firing, with cheap food
and few taxes, could tackle the slop pants, and the
slop boots, and the reach-me-down underclothing
just as well as anybody else, and the cheap ship,
manned by the cheap nigger, would bring his
produce to England for next to nothing, and the
cheap lumper would unload it for almost nothing,
and there would be no duty to pay, and the end
of the sweated London toiler would be worse than
the beginning. Yet though the sweated person
is cheap the sweated article isn’t. In a country
where the average wealth is over £3OO per head
prices are always fairly high. They are based to
a great extent on the purchasing power of the
- affluent half of the population and of the
bloated few, while as to the great starving
section, it isn’t catered for to any great
extent except in a few lines, not being
seriously expected to purchase anything beyond
bare necessaries. And among people who often
dispense with meat, butter, fish, cheese, jam,
pickles, furniture and bedding (rags and news-
papers can form a couch and the unfinished sewing
work often serves as a covering), and whose very
scanty clothing is bought second-hand or possibly
cadged off “the parish,” necessaries are very
bare indeed.
* * * *
There are still some Freetrade Laborites in
Australia who believe in imports because they
fancy them to be cheap. The cheapness is to a
great extent a delusion ; the worker is economical
enough, but the middleman and the landlord see
to it that the goods are not. But, even granting
the cheapness, it is a question whether the indi-
vidual, who is willing to profit by such economy,
shouldn’t be afraid to die, and if he hasn’t
every right to be greatly alarmed as to
what may happen to him after death. To be a
Freetrade Laborite, gladly taking advantage of a
real or imaginary twopence saved by such horrors
as those of the sweated industries of England, is
to be a sweater of the worst kind. The ultimate
employer of the wretched woman who makes
shirts from 12 to 17 hours a day at 9s. fid. per
week, is the buyer of the article —the man like
Page, M.H.R., the virulent Freetrader from
Queensland. And the fact that Page, who is
part of the cause, and the miserable nine-and-
sixpenny woman, who is part of the effect, are
very far apart doesn’t diminish the responsibility
of Page, the sweater, by one iota. He and his
kind may only sweat by proxy, but all the same
it is really they who are held up to obloquy ..
such books as “ Alton Locke,” and such poems as
“The Song of the Shirt.” And the hypocrisy
of clamoring for good wages and fair hours in the
handful of industries which it is possible to have
here under Freetrade conditions, while being a
voluntary and sordid accomplice of the horrors of
a multitude of sweated industries among people
of our own race simply because these people are
far off, is rather an aggravation of the offence
than otherwise. If Page and his kind are re-
solved to be voluntary sweaters of the worst type
it would look better to go the whole hog.
* * * *
It is a cant phrase among Freetraders that this
fair young country doesn’t want to raise squalid
manufacturing towns in its midst —-that it wants
its people to live in the open air, and to health-
fully pursue the wheat and the sheep and the
bullock. The argument is a mere shirking of
our responsibilities. If we have our manufac-
turing towns here we can see that they are neither
squalid nor unhealthy. A factory can be made
ornamental, just as a church can be. By rigid
laws regarding cleanliness, ventilation, water
supply, over-crowding, wages and hours of labor,
the life of the factory operative can be made as
healthy as that of any one else. As a case in
point, Maoriland has a larger proportion of its
people employed in manufactures than any other
State of Australasia, and a larger proportion than
is to be found in most of the countries of the
world, and yet its death rate is the lowest that
the globe can show. But if, to save ourselves the
trouble of making our manufacturing towns
healthy, we have no manufacturing towns of our
own, then we must hire the use of some one
else’s manufacturing towns, and give them our
patronage and support, and wink at their
practices. Consequently their slums are, in
a measure, our slums, and their sweating
is our sweating ; and when Page, the Labor
Freetrader from Queensland, voluntarily employs
the wretched London woman at 9s. 6d. a week
and 12 to 17 hours a day to make his shirts, it is
the same disgrace to him as if he employed the
woman at his own door under similar conditions.
The Bulletin cheerfully admits that some of its
own wearables may be made under exactly the
same conditions, but it sets forth the difference
—that it calls out, in and out of season, for
Australian manufactures, with good pay and
fair hours; that it demands a tariff that will
wholly shut out the products of sweated indus-
tries and that when that tariff arrives and
creates a demand for labor that exceeds the local
supply, it will gladly insert free a two-column
advt. next to reading matter to tell the sweated
employee of English, Irish, Welsh or Scottish
birth that there is a job waiting here at decent
wages, and reasonable hours, and under healthy
conditions. Furthermore, as that employee lacks
the necessary passage money, it is fully prepared
to pay its share of the cost of assisting him or her
to these shores. And if, in the meantime,
it is compelled, by reason of a miserably
inefficient tariff, to be one of the em-
ployers of the skeletons who sleep on
rags in unfurnished rooms, and live on dry bread
and a thin fluid made out of tea refuse, it does it
with regret, and under pressure of necessity. It
isn’t a voluntary sweater, like Page, the Free-
trader from Queensland.

•Furthermore, this paper has no faith in the
Gospel of Cheapness. It firmly believes that if
Australia puts on a prohibitive tariff, and starts
its own manufactures in a wholesale way, and
helps and encourages British immigrants to come
out here to supply the labor required in these
manufactures, and makes it a chilled-steel,
riveted, armored, boiler-plated law that a good
living wage must be paid in every industry, and
discourages trusts, combines, and monopolies, and
utterly destroys the great landlord—it firmly
believes that, if all these things are done, this
will be a land of cheap production. The middle-
man may get less, and the landlord may get
less, but there is no reason why, when the country
has got over the preliminary disturbance, and
adapted itself to the new conditions, goods should
cost any more. There isn’t even any reason why
the profits of the genuine manufacturer should be
seriously diminished. It is difficult for any
reasonable being to see why the “biled shirt”
that is made for one penny and a halfpenny and
sold at ss. 6d. shouldn’t struggle through at ss. 6d.
if the maker got 3d. or 4d. or even the towering
sum of fid. The 4|d. extra for making might
come off the ground landlord, who, as a rule,
can stand the loss. A claimant has just gone from
Sydney to London to put in his demand for a bit
of land in the British capital which is said to yield
£2,000,000 a year in rent, and if the shirt was
made in Sydney for fid. instead of in London for
lijd., the corresponding bit of land in that city
would possibly only yield £500,000 a year in rent.
But even £500,000 a year is something, and quite
a lot of people pull through on that. And if the
shirt did cost ss. Bd. instead of ss. fid., it isn’t
worth anybody’s while to lose his soul for 2d., or
to be a sweater for l|d.
THE WADE GOVERNMENT.
The Wade Government in New South Wales is
the old Carruthers gang, minus the rat-like
cuteness of Joseph Carruthers and the pomp-
ously respectable appearance of James Ashton.
It offers nothing new in the way of policy, nothing
new in the way of manners. As regards its
programme it will continue to do as little as
possible, relying for a grip on office on the hope
that it can persuade people that it is “better
than the Labor party.” (To hold office on the
plea that one is the less of two evils, and. the
smaller and less inky devil of the pair, isn’t
very dignified.) As regards its administration,
the Wade Government will continue the
Carruthers’ method of being a small and irrita-
ting insect, buzzing in the ear of Australia. That
not one-tenth of the voters approve of the small-
minded cantankerousness towards Australia which
Wade promises to continue is as certain as any-
thing human can be. There is nothing in the
climate, the natural features, or the usual food of
the New South Wales man to so differentiate
him from other Australians that he must behave
like an unpleasant infant with the colic when-
ever the Commonwealth comes into question.
But the small-minded and stupid Mr. Wade, fol-
lowing blindly in the steps of the small-minded and
cunning Mr. Carruthers, fancies it is “ good
business ” to be anti-Australian, and is resolved
to continue in that attitude. The resolve was
publicly declared at a very early stage.
When the Wade Ministry was announced,
Lyne, on behalf of the Australian Government,
promptly came forward with a courteous invita-
tion to let bygones be bygones, and allow the
dead and evil past to be decently buried and
forgotten. The invitation at that stage was mag-
nanimous. The results of the elections had shown
that anti-Australianism, regarded as a party cry,
was a fail ure. It had wrecked the fortunes of Carru-
thers, and obviously, if there had been on the
other side an Opposition making it its business to
be aggressively Australian, it would have
absolutely ruined the so-called “Reform ” party.
Lyne might, with ample justification, have left
Wade in his unpleasant and ultimately untenable
position, and waited for him to announce his own
failure. But, very handsomely, the Australian
Minister suggested that there was now no reason
for anything but friendliness. Wade promptly
snarled back an assurance that he, as officially
representing N. S. Wales, still intended to be the
sulky child in the corner. A paragraph in the
Sydney Telegraph (8/10/’O7) puts the facts clearly:
In the course of a few complimentary remarks on the
new State Ministry, as published in our issue yesterday,
Mr. Lyne expressed the opinion that there would
not now be the same friction between the State and the
Commonwealth as there had been. It was certainly not
the desire of the Federal Government that there should
be friction. He looked forward to a period of very much
better relations between the Governments. Mr. Lyne
also stated that there was a desire on the part of the
Wade Ministry not to create trouble, and that did away
with the urgency of dealing with the wire-netting duties
until they came along in the ordinary course of the tariff
debate. Mr. Wade no iced these remarks, and made
some observations on them yesterday. “As to the
Federal attitude,” the Premier said, “ I hold very strong
views of the rights of this State as a component part of
the Federation, and that those rights should be observed
loyally and sacredly. I have every hope that Mr. Lyne
realises that the present Government has at heart the in-
terests of the State in this respect, and I trust it will
occur to him that it is very desirable that the forbear-
ance of the State and its people should not be further
strained. I don’t know what ground Mr. Lyne had for
suggesting that we were willing that the discussion on
the wire-netting' duties should be postponed. On the
contrary, we are very anxious that this question should
be disposed of as early as possible, so that the settlers
may know what their position is going to be.”
\ * * ■*
So things are to be as before. The great and
powerful State of N. S. Wales, which should,
from its position, its population, and its wide
range of products, dominate the. Federation, is to
continue the whining complaints of the brat with
an injury to its temper, or the lorn widow with
an incurable habit of tears. To this extent,
N. S. Wales loses by the substitution of Mr.
Wade for Mr. Oarruthers. There is very
little doubt that Oarruthers, who was
cute enough as a rule, would, after the lessons
of the last elections, have dropped his anti-
Australianism. But Wade, who is a wooden
and stupid man, does not know how to
take the opportunity to retire from an untenable
position. He does not see that what destroyed
Oarruthers will surely also destroy him. He
cannot recognise the strength of the Australian
sentiment in N. S. Wales, which at last State
elections was able to return an anti-OARRUTHERS
majority as a protest against Joseph’s anti-Aus-
tralianism, though it had no daily paper support
and no organised party to rally round. If the
N. S. Wales Labor party as a whole had
chosen to even pretend to be Australian, there
would have been an end of the “ Reform ” party.
If Sydney had had but one daily paper
on the right side, an independent party might
have been organised to represent the Australian
sentiment. But judgment was, in a sense,
allowed to go by default. There was no official
appearance on behalf of Australia, no definite
challenge to the miserable pettiness of the State
Frights policy ; and, even so, without guidance,
and without the stimulus of any leadership, a
majority of the voters instinctively voted against
Oarruthers. Many of the Labor candidates
distinctly disavowed being any more Australian
than Oarruthers. Such of them as didn’t were
triumphantly returned ; others got suffrages
on the suspicion that they might be better
than their professions. Every reasonable oppor-
tunity was taken by the voters to be unpleasant
to the Insect Premier. The opportunities were
very limited ; but the net result was to force him
into retirement. Wade can see nothing of all
that, and when Lyne went out of his way to help
him to drop all the old, silly, disgraceful business
he yapped back a refusal.
-x * *
As it stands, the Wade Government is some-
thing that should be destroyed at the earliest
possible moment in the interests of N. S. Males’
dignity and Australia’s progress. In its personnel
it is frankly contemptible, representing more the
dregs than the selected best of the Parliament.
In its programme it is colorless and weak. Its
only outstanding feature is its antagonism to the
Commonwealth. Take away that, and all its
reason for existence vanishes. Unfortunately
there is no party, unless the Owe’Sullivan is able
to organise one, which can, or will, issue a chal-
lenge on that point. In moving a hopeless vote
of censure on the Government at the outset of the
session, McGowen was careful to dissociate him-
self from any suspicion of strong Australian
nationalism. He growled feebly over a number
of small points of administrative abuse, but
avoided coming to issue over the one great ques-
tion upon which the Government is clearly out of
sympathy with the people. On the fa.ce of things,
Wade will'be able to hold office during this Par-
liament, and continue to misrepresent N. S.
Wales in the Federation. The best that the
people can hope for is that at the next ballot the
Australian sentiment will have some organised
representation.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Face of Lysaght and the Nose of Labor.
On Thursday night, last week, a majority of the
Federal Labor members proved that they had. in
their composition none of the stuff of which
statesmen are made, and that they are petty-
minded enough to sacrifice the interests of Aus-
tralia in their desire to get back on a Sydney
employer. There was feverish hurry on the part
of the foreign-traders to get the wire-netting duty
dealt with right away, and it proved that the
rush arose in some measure from the fact that a
large number of Labor members were so inflamed
for the moment against the Sydney firm of
Lysaght Bros, that they would vote for either a
low duty or no duty at all. The Lysaght firm has
had trouble with its employees, and some of the
Labor members confused the Lysaght firm with
the Australian wire-netting industry. Concerning
the sense of a firm which, having sunk a large sum
in a netting industry, promptly quarrelled with the
members of a party that held the successful run-
ning of the industry in the hollow of its hand, the
less said the better. It is the firm’s private con-
cern, and anyhow, even the calmest consideration
of the question is likely to lead this paper into
bad language. Instead of keeping on a high duty.


and then by means of the new Protection shak-
ing better wages and conditions out of the manu-
facturers, Labor took away most of the Protection,
and left the industry with a miserable 10 per cent,
against the world and 5 per cent, against Britain.
This was revenue on Lysaghts for having
quarrelled with their employees. And what the
Labor members think they have gained, only
Heaven and they know. Faced with fou'ign
competition, Lysaghts will probably oe unable
to improve the lot of their workers even were they
disposed to, and they are not likely to feel that
way under the circumstances. The industry will
en- vnne to straggle along, and the operatives
win be compelled by lack of other netting
factories to accept Lysaghts’ conditions, good,
bad, or indifferent, or find some other occupation.
The Labor members who voted for the reduced
duty have made the position of the whole in-
dustry bad, and the unfortunate workers will
have the worst end of the bnd condi' 1 ions, as they
always have. Had the duty been r rained, other
netting mills would have started, md created a
deman I for more wire worker-, and thereby in-
creased che value of each individual operative.
This would have enabled Lysaghts’ employees, if
not satisfied, to have found other openings. It
would have increased the number of hands em-
ployed at Lithgow, where the special land of
wire necessary for netting would have been manu-
factured, and it would have increased the demand
for the Australian spelt-t used to coat the
wire, and thereby made things better for the men
employed in that industry, and have benefited
Australian labor generally. But to spite the face
of Lysaght these precious Federal Labor mem-
bers have cut off the noses of quite an army of
their own supporters. And, curiously enough,
they seem to be proud of it, and imagine that it
is a stroke of statesmanship.
Condensed Milk and Idiocy.
That quaint old dodo, the Convinced Freetrader,
fluttered his moulting feathers with disastrous
results to the Cause the other day at Bathurst
(N.S.W.). Gr. Whalan his name was, and he had
been away on a holiday, and on his return wrote
unwarily of his travel impressions in the local
Reidite organ. As thus :
During my recent trip to Queensland, I paid a visit to
the Oresbrook Condensed Milk Factor} 7 , around which
has grown up a new township called Toogoolawab.
... The industry was started by Mr. T. C. McConnell, the
present member for Stanley in the Queensland Legisla-
tive Assembly, and illustrates what a big- landholder may
do for himself and neighbors, by cutting up his estate into
small holdings. It is said that Mr. MoConn ll had a large
property that was by no means as profitable to him as it
should be, when he cone ived the idea of the milk factory.
The land was subdivided and sold to bona fide occupiers,
and the works were placed in the midst of the holdings,
with the understanding that all the milk that could be
produced by the men who had taken up the land
would be purchased. The plan seems to have worked
admirably, and now in addition to a number of
prosperous farmers in the neighborhood, there is a
town of resp ctable size, with every indication that
it will shortly grow to considerable importance.
Now, I am given to understand by users that the quality
of the Cresbrook condensed milk is equal to the best of
the milk imported. ... All the tins required are manu-
factured on the premises, and quite a number of machines
are employed for this part of the business alone—cutting,
fitting, and soldering all being done by machinery. At
the time of my visit, there were about twenty suppliers,
who sent in a daily average of 2200 gallons of milk for
treatment. When tinned and labelled, the milk is packed
in cases containing four dozen tins each. The labelling is
done by girls, and, for the labels themselves, standing
orders of a million at a time are placed with a Brisbane
printing firm.
The springing up of this particular industry has
therefore :
(1) Caused a new township (Toogoolawah) to grow up.
(2) Automatically brought about the sub-division of
one of Bananaland’s big estates.
(3) Settled “a number of prosperous farmers in the
neighborhood.”
Also 2200 gallons of milk are treated daily ; the
quality of the Cresbrook condensed article “is
equal to the best of the milk imported ” ; all the
tins required are manufactured on the spot, and
labels for the said tins are supplied, a million at
a time, by a Brisbane firm employing Brisbane
girls at fair wages. Was it to be wondered at
that G-. Whalan wound up his screed with a
passionate demand for something of the sort in
Bathurst? And then a local Protectionist uprose
and muttered the one word, “Tariff.” You
could have felled Gr. Whalan with the shortest-
weighted tin of boracic acid and goat’s milk
labelled “Pure Swiss” that ever came out of
Amurrika. Seizing his stylo, he unloaded the
following upon the amazed and demoralised
editor: —
Sir, —When I wrote the little article about the Cres-
brook milk factory, I was not aware that the success of
the venture was in any connected with a Customs duty,
but I find, on reference to the Commonwealth tariff re-
cently in force, that there was a duty of Id. per lb. on
preserved milk, and this, I believe, is increased under the
new tariff with which this country is temporarily afflicted.
This, in my opinion, is not in the best interests of the
industry concerned, nor of the community as a whole.
As, however, your correspondent it still a Protectionist,
notwithstanding what appears to me to be the unanswer-
able arguments of those who take the other side, it will
be useless to pursue this correspondence farther, etc.
Now, what can you do with a person like G.
Whalan ?
«
Beer and Blather.
The “poor working man ” last week got a fine
object-lesson as to the real value of the importers’
tears that are shed on account of his woes. Under
the Federal tariff there is a duty of tenpence a
dozen on bottles. Consequently English bottled
beer has been put up from 11s. 3d. to 12s. per
dozen: and the poor working man, who doesn’t
drink English bottled beer once in three years as
a rule, was made quite moist and uncomfortable
through the Foreign-trade papers weeping over
him. Even these papers had to admit that, if the
poor working man called fora glass of “ English ”
at the bar, he wouldn’t have to pay more than he
had been paying hitherto ; also, as a rule, he
wouldn’t have to pay any more if he bought his
imported beer by the single bottle. He
would only have to pay the extra money if he
bought his bottled English by the dozen—and, as
everybody knows, the average poor working man
doesn’t get in twelve of bottled English (at 12s. a
dozen) oftener than twice a week as a general
thing. As for the poor working man who doesn’t
buy his bottled English by the dozen—
The Federal tariff on British and imported beers and
stouts has driven the consumer to buy colonial products—
This is from the interview with the man whom all
three Sydney Foreign-trade papers called upon as
the authority on the subject —
This has resulted in the latter (Australian beer) of late
developing a very high quality. This much Federation
has certainly been responsible for. Indeed, since 1901,
colonial ales and stouts have become so superior that
they are now competing favorably with the best brands
of the imported article on the market.
So the horrible infliction put upon the poor work-
ing man boils down to this : the tariff has resulted
in his getting a much better beer than he
used to get, and he gets the better beer for the
same money ; while as for the person who doesn’t
reckon himself a poor working man, and buys his
beer m a bottle, he is now getting for ss. 6d. a
dozen a beer equal to the best imported for which
he used to have to pay at least 11s. 3d. That means
that, admittedly as the result of the tariff and the
consequent development of the “colonial” beer
trade, the poor, distressed Australian is getting
two dozen bottles of beer for less than he used to
have to pay for one dozen, and the two dozen are
as good, if not better, and when he has got the
two dozen instead of the old one dozen he still
has 3d. left to buy a cigar with.
The Case of Reuben Ward.
The N.S.W. Government has made a compromise
between its conscience and the hangman by com-
muting the death sentence passed on Reuben
Ward, at Dubbo, to life imprisonment. It is
carefully remarked in the papers that the
matter will be reconsidered “should any
new evidence turn up.” But the trouble
lies rather in the want of any reasonable
turning-up on the part of the old evidence.
Ward was convicted solely on the statement of a
girl admittedly subject to fits—a girl who left a
hotel with him without any compulsion; who
went with him, without any compulsion, to
the railway carriage sheds at night; who
there got into a deserted railway carriage
with him, by persuasion, it may be,
but without compulsion; and who alleges
that what happened afterwards was done by force
and contrary to her wishes. It was on the bare,
blank, utterly uncorroborated statement of the
girl who did so many remarkable things that
Reuben Ward was convicted. And the law
tossed Reuben for his life, with a double-headed
coin by assuring the girl that even if she swore
falsely in the matter, and was bowled out, no
harm would come to her. It didn’t give that
assurance in words, but the constant immunity of
the terribly-frequent female who makes that kind
of charge and who is bowled out, was about as
solid a promise as a written indemnity would
have been. Under these conditions the Govern-
ment has compromised with its conscience by a
sentence of life imprisonment, “and the matter
may be further considered if some new evidence
turns up.”
The Speech that Wasn’t, but Should Have
Been.
The Bulletin has got its own copy of the Speech
at the opening of the N.S.W. Parliament. The
name is on the wrapper. None other genuine :
Gentlemen op the Leghslative Assembly, and Gentlemen
who, being unable to get into the Leg. Assembly,.
HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE LEG. COUNCIL, AND OTHERS.
My advisers would just as soon not meet you. Bm,
there would be a row if they didn’t.
However, they will get the thing- over as soon as they
can. They realise that the less you know of them, the.
better you will like them.
You will observe that J. H. Carruthnrs is not my
principal adviser any longer. The fact is, while my back
was turned, he induced the nice-looking old gentleman I
left in my shoes to agree to make an awful ass of N. 8.
Wales. Of course I couldn’t say much. And really the
poor little beggar got such a hiding when he appealed to
the country, and his colleagues were so nasty to him
about it, that I was glad afterwards I didn’t say much.
My late principal'adviser therefore found it advisable
to refrain from anything more exciting than the attempt-
to pick doubles at Randwick. If levity were not out of
place at such a time as this, I should remark that he
backed Collarit before the general elections, and found it
was the wrong horse.
Before the unfortunate outbreak of “ the meaner side-
of politics ” among my old advisers, they had arranged to-
fix up a Department of Agriculture. The idea was to
make two Ministers screw where only one screwed be-
fore. That would have fixed one more supporter for
certain. Unfortunately, they couldn’t agree upon the
supporter.
With regard to the Commonwealth of Australia, my;
new advisers are for the moment inclined to sit on a rail..-
It doesn’t pay, as the old crowd thought it would, to be
nasty to Australia. If you will give them two or three
months’grace they will make up their minds as to how -
disagreeable they intend to be on this question.
Gentlemen op the Legislative Assembly,—
Thank Heaven and the Constitution, the other old'
gentlemen haven’t got anything to do with the finances.
You only, therefore, are on in this act.
My old crowd had a ripping time last year. The chief
financial fakir figured out a surplus of £1,493,272. By
the new system you can have any size in surpluses that-
you like. We make them by the simple process of not
paying for things until after the surplus is declared. You.
will observe that, as we have to pay for the things after-
wards, we are not any better off than if we didn’t have a
surplus at all. Still even a bogus surplus catches some
votes.
Various remissions of taxes are proposed. Meantime,
we will go on selling over a million pounds’ worth of land
in the year and collaring the proceeds. In other words,
we make it easy for ourselves by making it darned hard
for our children. However, our children haven’t got
votes, so they don’t matter.
Still, between ourselves, don’t make too sure of the re-
mission of taxes. There’s a horrible slump in copper and
tin mining, and in several parts the crops look like turn-
ing out a failure. We seem to have had the last of the
run of good years.
You will miss my late chief adviser Joseph. I shall not
be here much longer myself, but I shall always remember
him as the young man who knew when to come in out of
the drought. Financial reputations have been very cheap
these last three years. Even the old Cyclorama Co.,
which fought the Battle of Gettysburg for so many years,
paid a dividend the other day, and it hadn’t done such a
thing before for 15 years. Joseph knew when to be ill.
Hon. Gentlemen of the Legislative Council and Gentle-
men of the Legislative Assembly,—
My advisers promised various things during the elec-
tions. They will make some sort of pretence to carry a
few of these promises into effect.
It really, however, isn’t worth mentioning what they
are. As my advisers are going to crawl into recess and
safety as soon as they can see an openings they do not
propose to seriously attempt legislation of any size.
You will now proceed to waste three weeks or so talk-
ing about everything under the sun on the pretence that
you are talking about these few remarks. You know it’s
a hollow fraud, this so-called speech of mine, and if I had
just telephoned down to Mr. Speaker to tell you to “ bog
in,” or if you had just “bogged in” without disturbing
me in my arduous duties of laying foundation stones,
things would have gone on exactly the same.
Gentlemen, bog in.

G. Reid.
The Bulletin does not profess to understand the
curious intricacies of legal etiquette, or the
wonderful code of legal ethics. Whenever it
attempts to consider such questions there arises a
quaint and noisy phantasmagoria. In the centre
a bill of Costs revolves and splutters like a huge
Catharine-wheel. From four corners bills of
Costs crackle and explode like that fireworks
design known to our infancy as “ the-devil-among-
the-tailoys.” Here and there grin Cheshire-cat-
faces of Costs. From all quarters issue dismal
howls of Costs. That is the Law as we see it. In a
spirit of humble inquiry, therefore, it is hereby
asked : How doesG. Reid, K.C.—aspirant to the
post of Prime Minister of the Commonwealth,
said to be aspirant to the post of Australian High
Commissioner —stand in regard to the Myerson
case ? The Myerson case, so far as it can be dis-
entangled from the Costs (which were enormous),
resolves itself into this: The two Myersons
bought goods on credit, promptly sold them at
auction, got together some £6OOO of ready money,
entrusted it to a female Myerson, and
then went bankrupt. The creditors, who
were all in the softgoods line, and who
hadn’t hearts to correspond with the nature of
their goods, alleged fraud, and the Myersons
(male) were put on trial. They sought legal help.
Two solicitors— Dan Levy (a “Reform” M.L.A.
in N. S. Wales) and E. Abigail —were engaged
(the latter seeming to drop out of the proceedings
at an early date), also G. Reid, K.C., Leader of
the Opposition in the Australian Parliament.
The legal help seems to have been enlisted by the
female Myerson, who paid the Costs in advance
in big notes. (“Big notes! Big notes!
When have we heard that phrase before?)
Levy and Abigail have been put under a robust
and rasping cross-examination by the Official
Assignee in the matter of taking those big notes.
That gentleman seemed to think that they ought
to have suspected that the lady with the big notes
was distributing money stolen from the creditors.
But so far G. Reid does not seem to have been
asked a question. Yet his share of the Costs was
enormous. He had a first fee of 150 guineas and
the daily refreshers of 50 guineas, the latter being
paid not through a solicitor but by the female
Myerson or her son in person. Again, The
Bulletin disavows any idea of dogmatising in a
matter of Costs. The subject is too vast, too
sacred, too much suggestive of the Eleusinian
mysteries. But —in a spirit of humble inquiry—
Is 150 guineas Brief fee and 50 guineas a day fair union
pay for a barrister defending a trumpery criminal case,
or should the huge fees offered have suggested to a man
of average intelligence that the money was a little shady?
Is G. Reid a man of average intelligence?
Is a barrister supposed to take his fees direct from the
client—in big notes—or is he supposed to get them
through a solicitor ?
Should the curiousness of the method of payment have
suggested to a man of common intelligence that the
Myerson money was fishy ?
'Supposing G. Reid knew that the Myerson female’s
money, tendered to him in big notes, in such irregular
fashion, was, in all human certainty, money with a
dubious history, and supposing that he recognised that
the fees paid to him were inordinately large, would that
have involved him in any resp Jnsibility to be coy about
taking them ?
It is on this last point that The Bulletin espe-
cially desires guidance. An answer would throw
•a little light on the mystery of Costs and the
ethics of a noble profession.

Perjury Committed While You Wait.
The woman who goes into the witness-box and
pours out a story of foul wrong and outrage which
the jury doesn’t believe is so common nowadays
that the daily papers don’t even mention her. At
Sydney Quarter Sessions last week a man was up
charged with robbery with violence. The woman
in this case told a circumstantial yarn of how she
j ust happened to be coming home from seeing a
friend off by a boat, when the man accosted her
in Elizabeth-street. After she had virtuously
told him she wanted none of his “funny busi-
ness,” he struck her in the face, dazed her, then
snatched a purse from her, and ran. She hadn’t,
she swore; seen him before on that evening,
though she had known him previously. Then,
one after the other, five people, men and women,
trooped into the box, and swore that they had
been with the couple for two hours before the
disturbance, and one of them was a girl
who had been sent into a hotel by the woman
with the tale of wrong to bring the prisoner out
•to her. Also, there was a fairly coherent story of
a quarrel the previous evening between the man
<and the woman, the woman accusing him of dally-
ing with a rival cat, and there xvas evidence of a
.recurrence of the bitter argument during this
,evening. Yet that woman swore she hadn’t seen
tyhe man on that evening previous to the alleged
-outrage. On a dozen other material points the
-evidence on which she was relying to get the man
tin gaol for four or five years was torn to pieces.
Fortunately that man could get witnesses, and he
~hasn’t gone to gaol; the jury didn’t take two
ijminutes to acquit. But it wasn’t the woman’s
fault. And nothing whatever has happened to
,her, and nothing is likely to happen. Two
•other women of the same profession were wit-
nesses, and they will know that nothing happens
to the woman. If they, in their turn, want to
. get even with a man who has crossed them—well,
if they use the old-fashioned poison or knife they
are very liable either to hang or to go to gaol for
it, whereas they can safely swear his liberty away.
If the event comes off. well and good ; if it doesn’t,
they are none the worse. Judges see this vile
form of perjury every month of the year—see it
so often that they seem nowadays to take no
notice of it; and the newspapers have got into the
same habit. As for the pobce, the equally
deplorable fact is that the female perjurers are
usually on the side cf the prosecution, and the
policeman is on that side practically every time.
He may not be prepared to swear that white is
black, but heis prepared toseedark-brownsmudges
on it. For instance, in the very case cited above
the question of the woman’s occupation arose. She
represented herself as a woman with a Bast cer-
tainly, but no Present. The police, propping up
her evidence, bore out that idea—the constable
“ hadn’t seen her for a considerable time past.”
Yet witness after witness, admittedly of this
class, referred to her without reproach as their
nightly companion. Of course the police said
nothing on which they could be charged with
perjury. They simply knew only what it suited
the prosecution to knew ; and though there is no
prospect of gaol for that sort of ignorance, there
ought to be an immediate prospect of the sack.
Then the administration of justice would be
several degrees purer, and one could look upon
the courts with much greater confidence—and
confidence in the courts is probably the very first
essential of civilisation.
Our Unfortunate Colored Brethren.
Considerable of a howl was raised a couple of
months ago by the Spruce Myth party of black
Australians and the missionary gang which is
always worrying about Tommy T anna’s soul, to
the effect that the deportation of the Kanakas
meant sending “ our unfortunate colored
brethren ” to certain death. It was explained
that the deported niggers were murdered by their
compatriots, who envied them the possessions
they brought back in their swags from Queens-
land. Certainly one contrary missionary got up
on his limbs and said that it was the other way
about—that the returning niggers brought guns
and tomahawks, and wiped out the Kerristianised
niggers on the islands who had been carefully
taught how not to fight. But at first his voice was
lost in the din, and be had as much chance as a
baby devil at the back of Hell. Now his voice is
no longer lost in the din. Terrible tales of
murder and rapine on the island of Malaita have
appeared in the Spruce Myth press, and the mis-
sion crowd has changed its tune, and declared that
the peaceful nigger from Queensland has returned
in a belltopper and a frock-coat, and is slaying
everybody promiscuously, and that our unchristian
White Australia policy is responsible. But
further investigation seems to show that there
are really no more murders than usual on the
islands. The returned Kanaka is neither more
nor less murderous than the one that stayed at
home; the trouble is that he is full of a coarse
public-house contempt for preachers. He knows
they aren’t gods. He believes he knows that
they are dirt. He has seen their empty churches
in Australia; he has seen them passing round the
frayed hat and grovelling for contributions ; he
has heard them called sin-shifters and sky-pilots
and devil-dodgers ; he has found them without
honor or credit or authority among the folk of
their own race; and with this knowledge he is
undermining the Church. So the parson holds
that the White Australia policy, which brings
back these niggers, is a sin, and he would
swear almost anything to persuade others to
the same belief. What wonder? His living is
threatened, and the muddy hand of the scoffer is
being wiped on his coat-tail.
Senator Pulsford’s letter, from England, cen-
suring N.S.W. Premier Carruthers for his
foolish wire-netting “coup,” contains some in-
structive passages :
Since the time when, in the Supreme Court of our
State, some four years ago, you sought for, and obtained,
a decision that goods imported by a State for the use of
its services were not liable to Customs duties, I have
wondered that the matter was allowed to rest, instead of
being resolutely pressed to a termination. Some time
ago, in the Senate, I asked certain questions on the sub-
ject, and, amongst other information, elicited the fact
that N.S.W., though successful in the action named, had
yet been obliged to pay not only its own costs, but those
of the Commonwealth also. This singular outcome of an
action at law resulted from the fact that the Common-
wealth is, by the Constitution, compelled to credit
and debit each State with its own Customs
revenue, and the expenditure in relation thereto. I
could not but observe at the time that, although N.S.W.
continued to pay duties on its imports, it was not out of
pocket by so doing, since the moneys paid as duties came
back again at the end of the month as revenue, and not
only so, but in cases where the duty was debited to loan
moneys it meant an actual increase of revenue. In view,
therefore, of the knowledge that, while the present
arrangement with regard to State revenue existed,
N.S.W., so far from losing, might even be gaining re-
venue, and that you, as Treasurer, apparently raised no
complaint, I hesitated to further deal with the subject in
the Senate.
This helps to explain why Carruthers didn’t
press to a determination that much-talked-
of action against the Commonwealth in support
of its “rights.” Carruthers was making money
out of State-imported material because he paid
for the imported railway material and so on out
of loans, and he charged the duty on the imported
railway material to loans, and then when the
duty (paid for out of loans) came back to Carru-
thers at the monthly division of the Federal
surplus, he put it into revenue and said with a
great flapping of his own banner, “ See what a
great financier lam ! ” So he was content to let
things go at that until he thought he saw a chance to
rake in some sorely-needed political advertisement
by being nasty with the Australian Government
on the subject. Also, the item shows the exact
value of the virtuous indignation of some legisla-
tors against anything savoring of “a viola-
tion of the Constitution.” Pulsford was
ready to shed his last vest button in defence of
the Constitution so long as he thought his high
moral attitude would pay his own State. But
when Pulsford found that the alleged “ viola-
tion” enabled the State Premier, who represented
his own old party, to do a villainous but profitable
political swindle by converting loan money into
revenue, Mr. Pulsford “ hesitated to further deal
with the subject.”

Up in Queensland the Nerang Shire Council has
sent around a circular, imploring other shire
councils to be indignant about the tariff and the
“ Federal Parliament’s grab” of extra pay. The
circular arrived at Balmoral lately, and the local
council was indignant at great length, and
according to request. One conspicuous ass, who
brayed louder than the rest, announced that “ the
grab” was plain robbery, because “ their salary
was fixed by the Constitution.” The Constitution
expressly gives power to the Parliament to fix its
own salary; but a small thing like that doesn’t
matter at Balmoral. On that basis of stupendous
ignorance, Balmoral settled the matter;
whereupon the rest of the business was rushed
through, and “ the matter of dealing with the
goat and dog tax was left with the chairman.”
The Bulletin approves of that, anyway; it
wouldn’t like to trust the Balmoral Shire Council
to deal with the matter of the goat tax.
Vive le Duma!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O ! The Czar has got the Duma,
And the Duma’s got the Czar ;
And the high conflicting parties
Do they know just “ where they are ?
For the one goes legislating
With an amplitude of jaw,
While the other’s abrogating
With a plenitude of paw.
Bones of Ivan and of Peter
(0 ! the million moujik slaves
It’s enough to make you wriggle
In the marble of your graves—
Just to see your poor descendant
How he trembles on the throne,
When the Duma says : “ The People
Have a sou} to call theit own ! ’
Shall the glorious Little Father,
Who was King and Lord and God,
Shall he stoop to take the counsel
Of the pedlar and the clod ?
Shall the Romanoff who lorded
As the sole surviving King,
Shall he meekly tread the measure
That his faithful subjects sing?
Know ye how they trained old Bruin
To the dance in days of yore ?
Plates of iron, duly heated,
Were his dainty dancing floor ;
And whene’er the bear went tripping
To delight the gaping street,
Twas the mem’ry of the iron
That inspired his dancing feet.
And before the Czar can trip it
As a modern monarch should,
He must pace the floor of torment
Till there rises in his blood
Such a love of dancing duly
In a strictly legal maze
To the tune, so soft and trancing.
That his piping Duma plays.

The Great Shoddy Frost.
One of the saddest ceremonies for months was G.
Reid’s monster Tariff Demonstration, at Sydney
Town Hall, on Monday night. The Telegraph
preserved a wary silence the next morning as to
the number of citizens who pressed forward to
demonstrate; the S.M.H. opined there were
“about 500.” This scribe was on the
spot, and counted. There were 22 on
the platform. Thirty souls thronged ’the
left-hand gallery, and a solid 54 were massed
to the right. The body of the hall seethed with a
teeming congregation of 120 or 130, mostly females..
When this writer arrived, at about 8.30 p.m.,
G. Reid was explaining, in the midst of a tomb-
like silence, that the meeting was bound to have
been a frost anyhow, as it had been delayed too
long; “there would have been no end of enthu-
siasm,” is how the Telegraph reports him, “but
it was not to be expected when the people had
become accustomed to the tariff.” This state-
ment that the tariff had improved so vastly on
acquaintance that opposition was already almost
dead failed to appeal to a small man, who de-
manded hoarsely, “What erbout Nelken? Why
didn’t yer turn up at Nelken’s meeting, yer
treacherous cow ? Why don’t yer fight the tariff
in Melbourne?” He was soothed by a lady
friend, and G. Reid droned on, saying dread-
ful things like this :
No one would cry out if the stamp duty on receipts
were removed either, but the charming thing about Pro-
tection was that once the people got accustomed to a 20
per cent, duty, they had a great desire to be taxed
another 10 per cent., and a further 10 per cent, on top
of it.
This assurance that Protection only required to
be tried to become popular fell rather flat. At
9.10 p.m. this writer stole away, leaving behind
the indefinable “atmosphere” that so surely
connotes the presence of something dead.
Just about the time when S. M. Herald was sarcas-
tically asking, with special reference to the sugar
industry, what Australia was going to do with its
surplus products when local production, shoved
along by High Protection, has passed thp home
demand, N.S.W. Mines Minister was reading this
report from his State’s S’African Commercial
Agent Valuer
Our sugar trade with South Africa practically com-
menced in 1904, the imports from Australia in that year
amounting to 560 tons, of a value of £7OBO. This sugar
was pronounced by the buyers to be very suitable for the
market, and the trade steadily increased, the quantity
imported in 1905 being 844 tons, of the value of £14,492.
The trade was, however, hampered by preferential Cus-
toms duties which allowed Mauritius sugar to be admitted
as “ unrefined,” at 3s. 6d. per 1001 b.; but classed Austra-
lian sugar as “refined,” and imposed a duty of ss. per
1001 b. upon it. ... At the Customs conference in
March, 1906, the duty was altered to 3s. 6d. per 1001 b.
of all ordinary sugars, and ss. for special sugars, such as
loaf, icing, etc., no preference being given to any coun-
try. Although these duties only came into force during
the latter half of 1906, they had such an effect upon our
trade that the quantity imported from Australia in 1906
rose to 2849 tons, valued at £32,629. The total quantity
of sugar imported into South Africa during the year 1906
was 56,410 tons, valued at £613,687, so that there is
plenty of room for a further expansion.
Considering that within three years Australian
sugar exports to S’Africa alone climbed from
£7OBO worth to £32,629 worth—this despite (during
the greater part of the time) unfavorable Customs
treatment—and considering that on the 1906
figures there are still about £581,000 worth per
annum of trade for Australian sugar to cut into
in S’Africa ; and further, considering that what
has happened in S’Africa may also happen in other
countries which the Herald ignored in its pessi-
mistic wail, just as it ignored S’Africa, there
doesn’t seem to be much need for the Herald to
worry acutely about what Australia is going to
do with its surplus sugar. For an industry which
is allegedly ruined by Protection, the loss of its
Kanaka, high wages, scarcity of white labor,
and Government interference, the sugar biz. seems
to be struggling along all right.
«
Sydney Telegraph is shocked to find a duty
put upon illustrated books. Australia can’t dis-
pense with Milton, Shakspeare, etc., it says,
simply “in order to encourage local products.”
Who wants Australia to dispense with Milton,
Shakspeare, etc.? The United States doesn’t
dispense with either John or William ; yet the
U.S. have the same Customs regulations as Lyne
has introduced. The result is that all the big
European publishers re-issue their books in
N’York, and the U.S. get them that way.
Probably the Telegraph’s idea is that that means
a higher price, and that the people should get
their literature at the lowest possible price. In
that case, suppose the Telegraph starts at home.
It pays 30 or 40 per cent, dividends on its actual
capital. Suppose it cuts the div. down to 5 per
cent., and gives the reader the benefit of the con-
cession ? Or, if it isn’t prepared to do that, and
reckons that its readers are entitled to pay a
trifle to provide capitalists with good dividends,
it might anyhow knock off being a hypocrite, and
allow that readers are also entitled to, if neces-
sary, pay a trifle extra in order to provide Aus-
tralian workmen with Australian wages.
«.
According to Col. H. C. Stanley, the Aus-
tralian representative of the big English ship-
building and gun-making firm of Armstrong,
Whitworth and Co., those people are anxious to
make a contract with the Federal Government to
build some of the vessels that will be required for
the Australian navy. Not only that, but they
want, he says, to become the pioneers of Aus-
tralia’s big shipbuilding industry, and to plant a
shipyard out beyond Williamstown (Vic.), where
the water is deep and there is a natural dock
which, with a little improvement, would accom-
modate a dozen or so large vessels. Furthermore,
this firm wants to use Australia’s iron and coal in
its business, and to train and employ Australian
mechanics. Colonel Stanley can’t talk details
so far, and he apparently isn’t in a position to say
a very definite “Yes” or “No” about anything';
but as far as he can go it is good, cheerful talk,
and Australia will encourage him to see Deakin
and get down to details.
A DEPUTATION which lately waited on N.S.W. rail-
way magnate Johnson had the same old complaint
to make. The deputation represented the iron
foundries and agricultural machinery makers in
country towns, and it came to complain of the
unfair advantage that is given to the Sydney im-
porter as against the country manufacturer. For
instance, the freight on iron, the raw material of
the machinery maker, to Orange was stated at
655. a ton. On finished goods, such as ploughs
and harvesters, it was 325. 6d. Two three-
furrow ploughs can go to Temora for 445.
The iron to make them would be charged
90s. The ploughs would be worth £52; the
iron £l2. Steel shafting, used in manufacture,
consigned to, say, Temora, would cost £6 11s. 2d.
per ton ; shafting made in America or Germany
and already made up into a finished machine
would be £2 4s. And while this discriminating
tariff was in operation against the Temora imple-
ment maker and his raw material, the Temora
farmer could send his raw material (grain) to
Sydney for 10s. 6d. a ton. Johnson, in reply,
said that the Great Backbone of the Country ex-
pected the railways to be run for his benefit, but
he (Johnson) would think hard on the question.
♦
Gregory Wade, the new State Premier of
N.S.W., following in the footsteps of his pre-
decessor Carruthers, has stated :
I trust it will occur to him [Lyne] that it is very
desirable that the forbearance of this State [N.S.W.] and
its people should not be further strained.
But, like all the rest of the State Frights
weepers, Wade quite forgot to mention what
wrong had been done to N.S.W., or how
it had been strained. It was the lack
of any tangible wrong which prevented
Carruthers going to the High Court and de-
manding redress. It is the same complete lack
of any tangible wrong which prevents Wade
going to the High Court, and calling at the top
of his voice for redress. Carruthers is a lawyer.
Wade is a lawyer. The first idea of a lawyer, if
he has the ghost of a case, is to go to the court
and call at the top of his voice for redress. And
the fact that wild oxen won’t drag these two
screaming lawyers to the High Court to ask for
redress is a clear proof that they have no case,
and are perfectly aware of the fact.

That superior person, Ramsay Macdonald,
English Labor M.P., tells the poor, underpaid,
underfed millions of the country he legislates for
that Australian Laborites are “making a pro-
found mistake” in troubling about tariffs, and
Arbitration Courts, etc., instead of “getting a
hold upon the means of production, and starting
iron-works, etc.” This hifalutin talk about “the
means of production ”is mostly rubbish. What is
really worth worrying about —first, anyway—is,
not the means, but the fruits of production.
Macdonald, if he likes, can own the tree, if we
can make sure of the apples. Macdonald and
these other English snap-your-chains theorists are
not practical enough to see that. And naturally,
then, they are not practical enough to see also
that even if the State made iron and steel goods,
it would have to prohibit the importation of low-
wage-made iron and steel goods if it wanted the
Home market. Macdonald and his crowd, in
short, feed the underfed English millions on
phrases. The practical Australian Labor crowd,
on the other hand, prefers to feed its people on
something that you can cut with a knife, or eat
with a spoon.

The S. M. Herald nowadays encourages its
country correspondents to harass the Australian
Government with pinpricks. But they are
clumsy tools. One of them, at Collarendabri,
got in a yarn, the other day, about the disgust of
the backblocks because some telegraph stations
had been “ reduced to telephone offices.” There
is no secrecy, said the Herald’s stipendiary
mosquito ; “anyone who happens to be within 20
or 30 yards of the building can hear the operator’s
voice.” When the country correspondent talks
about snakes and bunyips the city has to believe
him, snakes and bunyips being off the city man’s
beat ; but when the country correspondent talks
about telephones, and says that the voice of the
operator can be heard 30yds. away—well, the city
remembers its own telephone bureaux, and
wonders why even the Herald doesn’t blush
to print such mischief-making rubbish.

Mrs. Molyneux Parkes, the feminine agitator
in the cause of Anti-Sosh, has been writing to the
Sydney dailies
I am in a position to make the following statement, on
competent authority : One of Europe’s foremost art coun-
tries had decided to arrange an exhibition of modern art
in Australia for a brief period during next year—an
exhibition which should have been of the greatest
value to our young artists. Since the Lyne tariff has
become known in Europe, and Australia thereby an-
nounced herself an enemy of art, the proposal has lapsed.
If passed, the Lyne tariff will, like the cold bleak wind
damaging the budding fruit-trees, retard the artistic
development of our youth for generations.
This makes the second wonderful exhibition that
nobody had ever heard about, but which was
just going to happen, only the tariff blighted it
in its infancy, so to speak. In this case the gloom
is deepened by the fact that even the name of the
“foremost art country ” is kept a dead secret, like
the name of the man who was going to invest
£700,000 9s. 2d. in a new industry, but didn’t.
Probably the great art centre is Bulgaria. In
that case Mrs. Parkes had better cable to Bul-
garia and tell it to go right ahead. The usual
practice is to refund the duty when the pictures
leave the country again, or else to hold the ex-
hibition in bond, so to speak.. It is quite a simple
business, and there is no reason why Mrs. M.
Parkes should worry.

Sydney Telegraph, commenting on the prag*
matical utterances of ex-Consul Iwasaki, when
he was being farewelled in Sydney, stated an
amazing principle of International Law in the
interests of its friend the Monkey :
The people of every country have every right, so long
as they are capable of enforcing it, to say who shall come
in and who shall not. But all who are already in, of
whatever nationality, are entitled to protection, and to
unimpeded facilities of pursuing their vocations.
The alleged principle is plain rubbish. Every
civilised Government exercises the right to deport
foreigners Whom it regards as dangerous, or
otherwise undesirable, by Executive order, with-
out proving or even alleging any specific offence
against them. Entire populations have been
deported in that way. The whole of the French
settlers in the Province of Acadie (now Nova
Scotia), after its surrender to Great Britain in
the middle of the 18th century, were deported ;
their offence was a refusal to become British sub-
jects, as provided by the terms of surrender.
Even when it comes to parting with a few
yards of soil for the especial purpose of helping
the State to defend the rest of their property, the
land sharks open their maws wide enough to
swallow a universe. The other day the Common-
wealth wan ced a strip of land near Hobart (Tas.)
for a rifle range, and this is the record of three of
the transactions: —
Colin Bain—wanted £8000; was offered £875 ; took
£l5OO.
O. Lord—wanted £l7OO ; took £920.
Hobart Golf Club —wanted £4500; finally accepted
£1230.
This last-mentioned superior shark actually issued
a writ for the £4500 it claimed, but wasn’t game
to fight the matter out publicly.
Grasshoppers are appearing in millions in some
districts. The wide-awake pastoralist is setting the
Tyree Spray to work. The results are wonderful. In a
few days the pest is thoroughly wiped out. The direc-
tions are : Spray the stony ridges where the grasshoppers
lay their eggs. It settles them completely. No necessity
to grow grasshoppers, or prickly pear, or lantana, or
briars, or blackberries, or any other pest. Get a few
Tyree Sprays and make money out of your land. Provi-

“ The Midnight Wedding ” was revived on
Saturday night last, at Sydney Royal, after a
term of months. It is plain drammer, as dis-
tinguished from the drama it claims to be.
Drammer in uniform does not differ materially
from the same article in tweed or other suitings.
The scene, for example, in “The Private Chapel
of the Strelsburgs” where the Princess Astrea
weds Paul, son of the Crown Prince, might
equally represent Merely Mary Ann being married
to her Doom (Bill) in the Trinity Church of their
joint bailiwick. And so throughout. There
is no line of the dialogue the distinction of
which serves to hoist this particular cele-
bration out of the ruck. The humor is
a thing to grieve over. The necessity for the
wearisome dress-exchange turn by Kathie and
Bobo in the Barrack Square does not appear. It
is eminently innocuous, man and maid retiring to
a couple of modestly reversed and segregated
sentry boxes to do their undressing. But the fun
is pointless and long drawn out, and checks what-
ever action the play has ; while, as business, it is
old enough to fly the white whisker signal of
decrepitude.
• • * •
When the above has been recorded it must
go to the credit of the players that they make the
crude stuff they have to handle fairly interesting.
If Harcourt Beatty doesn’t quickly capture the
collective heart of the Sydney and suburban
matinee girl, it will be clear proof that the Tariff,
combined with the Wrongs inflicted on Ma State,
have caused that soulful young person to degene-
rate and run to seed. Beatty is the one actor
Australia has at the present time who is equal to
making Paul a more or less convincing person-
age ; and on Saturday night Beatty was at his
best. Gaston Mervale plays well the part of Von
Scarsbruck, a perfect devil of a fellow', with a
character surpassing in hideousness that of a
Sosli candidate as conceived by a Deform
League chairwoman. Miss Madge Mclntosh
acts with force and earnestness in the rdle
of the Astrea Princess. There is a sort
of stock line in those Anthony Hope princesses,
who are Zenda-born and bred, whatever country
the programme may allege is theirs; and they
don’t in consequence give scope for originality of
treatment. It is rather depressing to see this
Bland-Anderson sort of play interpreted by mimes
who should be essaying better things ; the mount-
ing of it is as artistic as the playing thereof.
** * *
Andrew Mack is now giving the old ones
an airing at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, and is fight-
ing his way to the Earldom of Kenmare nightly,
and shaking a nimble foot on the passage.
Andrew has a habit of being an Earl, but, any-
how, the new peer has points over the previous
one; he gets the necessary purse-full for
the journey from a vague mine out
Nevada way. The other Earl, the ragged
one, is lifted to magnificence through the
bounty of a faithful old retainer who has saved it
up in a stocking ; and even for melodrama pur-
poses that stocking is just about worn out. After
Andrew Mack has been well-established at Ken-
mare Castle,' “ Arrah-na-Pogue ” will be revived
for a week ; then “Tom Moore.”
** * *
“ The Southern Cross ” continues to shine,
twinkle, blaze, and constellate considerably in
the dramatic firmament at Sydney Criterion.
The purist may hold that this play twinkles a
shade more than it constellates. But what odds ?
The Criterion public wants to see the show' it
patronises blaze, and “The Southern Cross’’does
it. When it’s neither shining, twinkling, nor
constellating (which is nearly all the same), it is
blazing like a conflagration in Hades, with every-
body rushing madly for the door.

The Butt-Rumford pair is filling Sydney
Towm Hall with voice and persons. Two more
concerts are promised by the Taits, who are
smiling so w'idely over the success of the Great
•Volume of Lady that if they used glove-stretchers
their smiles couldn’t be wider. The Large
Mass of Lady lets go her big voice most
suitably in such harmonies as “ Divinities du
Styx”; but when she sings wee songs about
babies who have ten little toes and one little nose,
all the actual and latent parenthood in the audi-
ence is so touched that it becomes more terrible
with noise and flaunted hanky than an army with
banners. The Butt repertoire seems to be very
limited. Fortunately for the Great Voiced Party,
the great heart of the Public beats most quickly
for old friends..

“ The Yellow Peril ” that was at Sydney
Palace has snuffed out. It w'as a frantic piece of
grease-paint, and quite unworthy the presence of
that fine actor, Harry Diver.

Wonderland City will have a concert next
Sunday night. Meantime, the Wild West Show
and Rivers of the World are drawing like two
teams of bullocks. Also the management is pre-
paring startling novelties for days to come.

The Molassos whirl at Sydney Tivoli eight
times a week, and Mr. Edward Cranston has
begun to present an “ original Irish racing
sketch,” which isn’t of much consequence. Price
and Revost are in their last days, and when they
go there will be plenty of room in the programme
for something sizeable.

Melbourne Princess’s indulged in four acts
of excited Conan Doyle story on Saturday night
and called it “ The Brigadier Gerard.” “The
Brigadier” is full of rush and bluster and bright
French uniforms and clash of arms. The first act
is an effective scene, and carries the only “real-
life ” tone in the outfit. Plimmer makes a great
point as the blusterous Major Olivier, then prac-
tically subsides for the rest of the play—except in
the last act, where he turns up again as an apology.
Julius, the Versatile, puts all the light of his blue
eyes into fine, flashing glances, and swaggers
through his part with tremendous “blow,”
and with the same voice wherewith he
used to beg “a little red rose.” Elbert Orton,
the Magnificent, is “in front ” for this play, and
the new leading lady, Miss Beatrice Irwin, has
her chance. The lady certainly does not rise to
expectations. There is much sensibility and
temperament in her work, but she struggles with
too much self-consciousness, and is inclined to
over-act. As the Countess de Roquelaure
there is room for occasional tense quietness,
but Miss Irwin flutters constantly in a distract-
ingly restless manner, like a captured butterfly.
She looks exquisitely pretty, and nervousness may
have much to do with her fluttering, but it would
be a relief if she changed the tone of her voice at
times. All through there is the same high,
tremulous timbre; no matter whether she be
imploring mercy from a tyrant or telling her
confident Brigadier that she loves him. Never-
theless, her work pleases the house, and she
receives enthusiastic acclamation at the end of
the play.. Bently does really good work. His
stiffness is lost (or permissible) as Major Bron,
and his Bron might have been born a soldier, so
effective is his commanding. Leslie Victor puts
an artist’s touch into his Talleyrand. It is rather
hard to have one’s Napoleon served up in
so large a dish. Hubert Willis has a fine concep-
tion of the Emperor part, but his light voice lacks
impressiveness, and his thin face and tall, padded
body do not help the eye sense. But the whole
play is finely dramatic, and is likely to have a
bounding run through its limit of eleven days.
** * *
“ The Great Rescue ” continues to be
made at the Theatre Royal (Melb.), to everyone’s
satisfaction. Red sparks fly out of the papier-
mache engine which the toy motor beats in a race
through 1500 yards of whirling canvas scenery,
and no realistic detail is neglected. Probably
the present drama will see Bland Holt to the end
of his present season, which is to close, with a
flourish of trumpets and amidst public lamenta-
tions, in about three weeks.

The Holloway co. this week wanders
through “The Shadows of a Great City,” a senile
melodrama introduced to Australia by Grattan
Riggs, some night in the long, long ago, when the
kangaroo still looked curiously down the shafts at
Bendigo and fled at night through the deserted
Exchange. The usual scrap-heap of broken hearts,
butchered humanity, and foolish infatuations has
been raked together by its author with the in-
evitable results. The “ Shadows” serves no good
purpose save to emphasise the good acting of the
people who struggle with the undertaking, and it
is a pity that such people should struggle with
such an undertaking. It is waste of people.
Miss Holloway is always pleasant, but as Nellie
Standish, the noble gyurl who stands rigidly by
her superfluous parent, she’s particularly
appealing, Harry Sweeney plays very capably
the swain who runs away from home and then
runs back again, and Godfrey Cass adds another
amazing study in stage villainy to his gallery.
For the rest, Biddy Roonan, the crone, is played
admirably by. J P. O’Neil, on the lines followed
by.the late lamented G. Riggs; and Jefferson
Taite and Mabel Russell give two tolerable
character sketches.

At Melbourne Opera House La 'Sylplie
whirls and pirouettes with considerable success.
Where her dancing doesn’t captivate her lithe
pink legs do, so everyone admires La Sylphe.
Monahan and Sheahan, who are a musical
spepialty pair, are the newest arrivals. They
aren't calculated to make a huge difference in any
programme, but they manage to be pleasing
enough. The Geraldos, the Whiteleys and Irving
Sayles are the other star performers.

“The Dairy Maids” will cease to milk
the dairy cow at Her Majesty’s (Melbourne) on
Friday night, and Saturday will see the com-
mencement of a one week’s run of “Dorothy ” —its
first Melbourne appearance in three years.
After that interval “Dorothy ” should be good for
more than seven days, but the management is in
haste to make room for a new show, “ The Girls
of Gottenberg,” on the 26th.

In the unusual absence .of all competition
by the Royal, Adelaide Tivoli has been doing
great business with its “all star” company, in
which are prominent the bar-bounding Vesto,
the funny juggler Depere, and Tod Callaway.
The Hippodrome has played “ Never too Late to
Mend ” (with Marie WiJlmott doing a notable
double as Josephs, the small prisoner who hangs
himself, and Jacky the aboriginal—the part of
which Alf Woods once had a sort of monopolv).
It is now doing a racing drama attributed to Nat
Gould. Peacock’s Pictures have held the Town
Hall, and the Perth City band is just moving into
the Royal (on its way to Ballarat). It is a good
band, but it takes no chances, and makes sure of
success by running in 4000 ft. of new pictures.
On October 3 a letter to this effect was
published from a Bathurst (N.S.W.) corres-
pondent :
A judiciously spent £5O would have saved Young- his
seat. His thiiftiness was much commented upon. In
fact a persistent rumor was about on the day of the elec-
tion that his wife was seen cutting his hair in his own
backyard to save the barber’s sprat.
To which Mr. Young replies that he spent not
£5O but £lOO over the election ; also that his wife
never cut his hair in her life.

AT POVERTY POINT.
“Vulcan”: Chicago (U.S.) Tribune scareheads re
“ Chicago supplying the world with prirna donnas,” and
brings these names along with a screech like two dozen
peacock aviaries being disturbed: Geraldine Farrar,
Jenny Osborn Hannam, Mary Garden, Marie de Rohan,
Fanehon Thompson, and Countess Vianci. Writer’s
private view is that the international reputations of the
above are about on a par with the international reputa-
tion of William Wilks. Anyhow, with all respect to the
•City of Canned Horror, he begs to advance an Australian
■sextette in opposition, Melba, Ada Crossley, Esta
O’Argo, Amy Castles, Ada Colley, Kate Rooney. Let
'Chic. Tribune lie down forthwith and feel sorry it spoke.
It has been discovered in London that the old Greek
■drama is “ intensely modern,” as well as being intensely
ancient and extremely intense. Therefore actor-manager
Martin Harvey, musing on the applause with which
select audiences have greeted Australian Gilbert Murray’s
translations from the Greek, talks of treating the com-
mon or peanut audience to a version of the adventures of
CEdipus, the gentleman (now dead) who answered the
riddle of the Sphinx—a “ competition ” fiend of that
period. But GUdipus had such a very early-Greek time of
it that he will probably need considerable bowdlerising
before he bursts on the vision of England’s sensitive
examiner of plays.
“Ruru” (M.L.) : The goings-on of Albani on the concert
platform fairly astonished Auckland. Compared with
the gam boilings of the elderly soprano, the friskings of
ithe lambs in the fields, or the kitten engaged in a chase
rafter mamma’s velvety tail, were as nought. We are not
•used to royal favorites. The lady bounded on like an
undiarubber ball, grabbing her skirt out of the way
■apparently just in time to prevent her falling over it.
•She ducked and dived and dipped her aigrette to all
.points of the compass. Accompanist Flint endeavored to
•do his duty in leading the lady on, but she always beat
•him by about a yard and a-half, though he ran like a
«wift Israelite bolting from Pharaoh. A local organist
iplayed the organ obligato to “ Crossing the Bar.” After-
wards he scrambled down, and was effacing himself as
'speedily as possible, when he was met in the narrow way
'by Albani leaping on to acknowledge the applause, with
'the accompanist and the violinist leaping after her. Or-
ganist Midgley was grabbed by the exuberant soprano and
rushed along to the front, where he looked astounded
and blushful while the lady shook his hand effusively, and
gesticulated amazingly. Electa Gifford (round with Jean
Gerardy) is the nearest approach we have had to the
Albani manner. But then Electa was youthful, tall and
slim, and her caracolings, while diverting, were not
comical. Some theatrical mimic in search of a novel turn
might make a good one out of the platform manner of
singers we have seen. She could style it “They have
their exits and their entrances.” There would be Melba,
slow of step, impressive, dignified (cavillers talk of cold-
ness, but how would they like to see Melba going on like
Albani ?) representing dignity ; Dolores would stand for
graciousness; Crossley, with her beams and hand-kissing,
would be the exponent of the chummy style ; Arral, with
dancing step, fascinating smile and Frenchy air, is charm ;
■and Albani—well, there would be no mistaking her ; she’
is just frisk. Albani is a stout sunbeam, a well-nourished
blossom dancing in the wind, a butterfly of weight, a
solid zephyr on two feet playing on the grass, or anythin"-
(ike that.
London has for the first time in its history a Yiddish
theatre. Sigmund Ferinman, the Yiddish tragedian,
secured a long lease, the other day, of the Pavilion
Theatre in the Mile-end Road (which is in the -heart of
Fogtown’s Ghetto), and played “The Jewish Hamlet”
last month to a suffering audience of compatriots. (“ The
Jewish Hamlet” is said, by those who have seen it on the
European continent, to be as bad as a Chinese opera, only
about 147 acts shorter.) It is now up to some
Sheeny mime or other to open with “ The Holy Sabbath”
opera at Potts Point.
Printed that Daisy Atherton, who has made such a
success in London in “ The Pocket Miss Hercules,” is a
daughter of Willie Edouin, who, half a century ago, was
the youngest of the three boys of “ The Edouin Family ”
—real name Bryer. The family toured Australia, India
and China with two sisters, Rose (Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis),
and Julia. The other “ boys,” Charlie (who married
Lizzie Naylor, afterwards Mrs. Edouin Bryer)
and John (who married Tilly Earl), are long since
dead. Willie Edouin’s first appearance on the boards
was in 1849 as a youngster, in a play called “ The Living
Marionettes.” He has played, he says, in every part of
the globe, and especially in Australia in the gold fever of
the ’fifties. Then he travelled from camp to camp (or
rush to rush) with his family in a van, on the sides of
which were inscribed in large red letters, “ The Cele-
brated Edouin Family, in Farce, Comedy and Burlesque.”
The performances mostly took place in tents, though
they sometimes transpired in the open air—so Willie told
an interviewer once.
“ G. 8.”: Having paid my 2s. for entrance to the Glaci-
arium and 6d. for the skates and 6d. for the boy who put
them on, I found myself wobbling through space and
clutching an attendant’s arm. My feet flung themselves
out at the back, kicked up in front, wobbled hesitatingly
and then shot out each side. Wobble ! Slide ! Wobble !
I grasped my attendant lovingly. ‘ ‘ The first time you’ve
been on the ice-skates, sir? ” he remarked pleasantly, as I
slithered and bumped and wobbled. I looked at him re-
proachfully. “ Yes,” I confirmed, trying to appear
cheerful, “it is the first time I’ve tried to walk on
knives.” We continued. He was a patient man, and we
scrambled round twice for 4d. “ Don’t leave me,” I
gasped, and then tried to smile courageously. I admired
that man. I admired, even while I envied, his serenity
and coolness on the ’ice. Again I clung to him.
“Don’t leave me,” I prayed; “I’ll have another
bob’s worth.” I loved the man and didn’t want
to let him go, but skating attendants are
as adamant to such clinging affection, and soon I was
left to the mercy of the ice, and the pitilessly critical
smiles of the onlookers. So I joined the great majority
who wriggle round the wall. I wriggled and wriggled,
manfully, strenuously, until I came face to face with a
fellow’-wriggler. His feet were placed one on either side
of mine. I was helpless. We glared at each other;
there is no brotherly love on the ice. “Will you please
move on?” I asked. “I can’t.” “Neither can I. Will
you please move on?” “You’ll have to sit down,” he
said, and added, mournfully, “ It’s so cold on the ice.” I
grabbed a passing attendant. “ Will you kindly help me
to sit down?” And we struggled to a seat. I smiled
ruefully. “It is the first time I have had to be assisted
to sit down.” Then the lookers-on pointed at me and
smiled with good-natured contempt. And 1 sat and
froze. I was dead up to my knees. “ Where are
the hot water pipes?” I asked. “How much must I
pay you to take me to the hot water pipes?” But I
never found them. On the ice the bad skaters and those
who can’t skate at all wriggle round the wall, but the good
skaters go up and down the centre, cutting threes and
figures of eight. Desperately I put my feet together and
shot out into the middle. There I circled round and
round midst the graceful, swaying skaters, making a
beautiful circle—round and round until I stopped dead in
the middle. There I grinned. Then I began again and
ended up each time at the grinning point. The fleeting,
aristocratic skaters who swished up and down the centre
began to look askance at me. An irresistible longing for
home seized me, but I couldn’t get off the ice. I longed
for the bell to ring, for someone to appear and order
everybody off, for the place to catch fire, or the ice to
melt—anything to end my misery. I began to freeze
again, so I shuffled back to the patient wrigglers. At
last the bell did ring. I was overjoyed. I was delighted.
I smiled at the wrigglers and beamed at the lookers-on.
Then I saw a large notice of the appearance whereof the
bell was only the herald : “ Everybody please to reverse.”
Sadly I began to wriggle round the other way.
“ F. 8.” : Joy Butt has placed her infant slipper in it.
While Mumsey was artlessly telling the reporter of one
great daily that Joy, cetat 6, always wept passionately
at the sound of the deep maternal boom, Joy was being
catechised by the representative of the other great daily
as thus : —“Do you ever hear mother sing?” “Often,”
replied Joy, happily. “I love to hear mother sing.”
What happened to Joy when these two totally different
statements confronted the agonised family at the break-
fast table next morning has not yet been given to the
press.
Edward Savral, the colored cakewalk pugilist, writes in
passionate denial of a Poverty Point rumor that he had
found religion. Edward, according to himself, plays
poker, German whist, 100, and two-up, and shakes the
dice when and wherever possible ; also he makes a book
on the Metrop. and such-like important events, and offers
doubles to the ultra-speculative. Between whiles he
writes torrid love songs (but no hymns), and in other
ways eschews the cold, hard, flat life. In fact, this par-
ticular coon is a perfect devil of a fellow, and doesn’t jud.
Gabled during the week that Jean Gerardy, the famous
’cellist, had married Miss Amelia McQuade, of Sydney,
the eldest daughter of the late Mr. Harry McQuade, of
“ Bomera,” Potts Point, and Mrs. Cecilie McQuade. The
bride’s mother used to do things on the stage. She was
introduced here by Miss Emily Soldene, who brought an
opera bouffe company to Sydney in 1877, with Miss Cecily
Durant as one of its members. The large and generous
lady mentions her in her “Recollections,” published in
1897, as a notable beauty.
“ D.” : A quaint absurdity of “ The Midnight Wedding,”
now nightly celebrating at Sydney Royal, is the punch-
ing business in Astrea’s bedchamber (Scene IV., Act II).
Here Paul Valmar (hero)set about the wicked Von Strels-
burg in a style reminiscent of L. Foley at his best.
But on the European continent (and that, presumably, is
where the action of all these “ uniform ” plays is laid) an
officer would not dream of using his fists on another’s
face. That is, in Continental eyes, a barbarous and savage
practice ; and a Court of Honor would make short work
of the male of the Junker class who attempted such a
thing. The conception of a couple of German or Austrian
militaires dealing it one to each other with bare knuckles
is rather more anomalous and impossible than that of
Peter Felix and Snowy Baker (say) meeting on Bondi
sands to exchange a couple of pistol shots at daybreak.
“ Billy T. South-street, Ballarat, threatens to develop
a plague for which poisoned baits will have to be laid in
the near future. The secretary declares that over a ton
of letters have passed through the post-offlee in connec-
tion with the present competitions ; £2OOO has been paid
for special trains ; and 5000 competitors have come before
the judges. Five thousand competitors; 5000 reciters,
singers, musicians, and immature actors! What an
army ! And what an instrument for repelling invasion
those 5000 desperate performers would make in the hands
of a great commander—-a man with original ideas, capable
of drawing the invaders’ fire with a sortie of reciters,
while attacking the right wing with brass bands, and
reciting “ The Deck Stood on the Burning Boy ” in strong
force to his left wing. But what troubles me is the fear
that if South-street continues the rest of us will cease to
think Australia worth defending.
“ Wexie ” : I happened to-day on a faded programme of
a benefit given to one-time Shakspearian tragedian (sic)
Bob Fuller, which took place at the old Royal Standard
about 12 years ago. Bob was supported by Clara
Stephenson, Charley Burford, and one or two raw (very
raw) amateurs. The affair, I remember, was regarded as
a good-natured joke by the profesh. The ghost scene
from “ Hamlet” was put on first, with Bob in the name
part, and Charley as his trusty pal, Horatio. The
ghost was amateur—quite amateur—and after a delay of
fully two minutes he came on at the wrong side, and
hovered anxiously about the coat-tails of Hamlet and
Horatio, trying hard to attract their attention. The
cold, bitter way in which he was told (after he had stum-
bled over something, and attracted Hamlet’s attention by
falling down) to go.round just as fast as he could gallop
and come on by the right entrance, was worth hearing.
Hamlet’s wig dropped off when he fell on his knees, but
that didn’t matter much. Later, Bob appeared as
Othello, and a very good and prim and proper young
Sunday-school elocutionist was Desdemona. She didn’t
understand stage realism worth a cent, and was so much
offended at the rude manner in which she was
asked for the handkerchief that she left the stage in high
dudgeon. Still ic was a fairly profitable benefit.
Both the old central figures have since passed out, and
Bob’s exit was dramatic. One Saturday night, a year or
so after the benefit, he had reached home from Paddy’s
Market (where he retailed doubtful pastry and sugar
ware), and was entertaining a select circle of friends over
a snack and “something.” Bob liked a drop of “some-
thing.” He was giving Mark Antony’s funeral oration,
and had reached the line : “My heart is in the coffin
therewith Caesar!” when his cronies were fairly dazzled
by his extra good form. He clutched his left breast con-
vincingly ; and the applause became uproarious when he
staggered towards where the supposed coffin was ; but it
died away into astonished silence when he fell, and hit
the floor hard. It couldn’t be the “something,” for Bob
had hardly started. He didn’t move, and his friends
leaped from the snack and lifted him up. Poor old Bob
needed a real coffin.
“ 10-2-4 ” : Heard the following on a tram yesterday
the offending parties being Two Ladies (hereinafter to be
known as Ist and 2nd L.— i.e. , Lady) respectively :
Ist L. : “ Have you seen her walking along Edgecliff
Road with the dear children V”
2nd L. (with telepathic comprehension): “ Oh, yes. It
was so touching that it almost made me cry.”
Ist L. : “ Bubsey, the eldest, has been fed, I see in the
papers, entirely on Smellin’s Food administered at all
hours of the day and night by Mr. Rumford himself.”
2nd L. : “Ah ! What a man ! And what a husband !
I shall get some Smellin’s Food for Harriet."
Ist L. : “ Toodles, the perfectly sweet thing that cries
as though to break her little heart whenever her mother
sings, and who says her voice reminds her of Paradise,
has already begun to show a marked talent for the
drama. But, of course, with such parents”
2nd L. : “ Exactly. And how dear and good and
womanly that was of Madam to own that she sang her
best to the babies in their nursery, and that they were her
keenest critics. So truly English ! As I always say to my
husband, these foreign singers, like Melba and Patti, may
be all very well on the platform. But what of true home-
life ? Well, there! They don’t rightly know the meaning
of the term.”
Ist L. : “The very identical point I made to my
husband. You know how hasty he can be, sneering at
people. Well, he said that the Butts’ home-life made him
tired, and the gag about their babies was d d clap-
trap (his very words); and had they come out, he asked
in his unpleasant manner, to sing, or to advertise their
gifts for running a crfiche?”
I lost the rest of the dialogue, having to get off the
tram and go home.
“ Brolga Bill ”: I don’t know which to admire most—
the contortions of Clara, the beauty of Butt, the mag-
nificence of Madam, or the splendid singing of Mrs. Rum-
ford. How different things would have been if Musgrove’s
German opera slingers had been able to bend at the
middle like the spacious gracious contralto ! By the way,
is she really a contralto ? The average critic will not be
game to give his real opinion ; he will form in line and
adulate with the rest of the importers’ papers. The lower
notes are good and serviceable ; but there is nothing of
the grand tone-poem about them. lam not a lover of
cavernous vocalism; but Ido expect the custodian of the
Voice of the Century to roll out some rich deep notes that
have the real, heart-catching contralto color.
. Harry : Can anyone say Why such dramatic effu"
sions as the notorious “ Uhlan Earts,”and the still more
notorious Fatal Wedding” are described as plays of
human interest ”? I had two six-penn’orths of “ Human
Hearts the other night, and I tried hard to discover
which character represented the “human interest.” It
certainly wasn’t the impossible village- blacksmith, who
resembled a muscular local preacher. It wasn’t the tramp
with the dislike for soap. It wasn’t the inhuman tart
who is described in the bills as being the possessor of a
Black Heart. It wasn’t the aristocratic villain, a cross
between Ned Kelly and a tailor’s model. It wasn’t other
people, too humorous to mention. So it must have been
either the good Salv’army sort of young lady who was
tru-u-ue, the idiot brother (by the way, which brother
was the idiot ?), or the cheeild. I think it must have been
the cheeild, for this infant prodigy accomplished the re-
formation of the tramp, touched the hearts of brutal
prison-warders, and won the affection of its ’ard-’earted
mother. Yes, the kid must have been the “ human in*
terest ” which caused the weeping of the gods.
“ Jimmie Pannikin ” : I suppose it’s heresy, but I must
say it. Clara Butt’s voice seems to me to be, not the
contralto of the century—hardly a contralto at all—but
rather a most magnificent mezzo-soprano, lacking the
full organ-like lower notes that distinguish great con-
tralti. On Saturday night the voice showed a splendid
middle register and a lovely high register under perfect
control; but the low notes were disappointing—so much
so that I expected to read in the dailies that the famous
mother and singer was affected vocally by our sudden
Sydney climate. Patey and Crossley used to roll out
glorious golden notes below the staff that thrilled one
through and through. I have had to readjust my ideas
about C. Butt. Her voice is not so mighty as I was led
to expect, and her vocal method is much more artistic
than I bargained for. I maintain that C.B. is a magnifi-
cent mezzo—not a contralto. As a matter of .surprising
fact, her husband’s singing touched me quite as much as
her own fine efforts. His enunciation equals Philip New-
bury’s clean-cut delivery.

“ Hiphen ” : What’s the matter with the one and only
Bland Holt, anyhow ? Seems as if he isn’t the grand colt
he was. Paid him 3s. worth of visit this week, and found
him sadly shaky on his lines. It seemed much a matter
of conjecture with him as to what came next. He finished
up many bad breaks by remarking in the last act to the
Hook (there’s always a dook or two now—Bland’s getting
very “class”): “When your son Alice marries my
daughter Wilfred ” and corrected himself, when the gods
had ceased to smile, by: “ When my daughter Wilfred
marries your son Alice.” However, h'is hand has not lost
its cunning in the matter of staging. The great race
between the train and the motor-car w T as intensely realistic
and calculated to deceive a V.R.C. steward. The only
thing I objected to was that Blandolt seemed to think he
was riding to win on a bike. He bumped about on the seat
excitedly while his daughter Alice (who was Miss Ross to
those in the know) sat back calmly and watched the
scenery flash by as if she were a returned prima-donna
toot-tooting around her native landscape in a million-
guinea muddy bloater car. However, even if Bland for-
got all the lines he ever knew, or tried to say them all at
once, he’d still be worth going to see.
“ Melb.” : I am chary of praising managers’ relatives,
but Miss Holloway is wonderfully transformed and char-
acteristic as Jo, while Mrs. Holloway amazes me by
getting into the skin of Hortense, except that she
elaborates it too much. Stanford’s Tulkinghorn walks as
completely out of “ Bleak House ” as the actor’s per-
sonality will allow. The original Melbourne cast in-
cluded : Jo, Jennie Lee ; Guster, Maggie Knight; Bucket,
Burnett; SirDedlock, Hoskins ; Tulkinghorn, Harwood ;
Ohadband, O’Brien; Guppy, W. B. Warner; Esther
Summerson, Lily Bryer; Snagsby, Daniels. Jennie Lee
acted Jo about 2000 times. The bite and edge were off
it here ;it was blurred with repetition. Dolly Green
(Dolores Drummond) made an English hit as Hortense,
after being accounted an indifferent actress in Australia.
Madame Janauschek used to double Lady Dedlock and
Hortense, obviously in a version different from Hollo-
way’s.
A Hoxfcon (London) general dealer ex-
hibits in his window the legend: “Secondhand

“ Shall we call this city the New York of
the Southern Hemisphere?” asked a pamphlet-
writing member of the recent Christian Endeavor
Conference in Melbourne. “ Shall we refer to it
as the Athens of the South?” Well, the idea
may seem absurd, but why not just call it Mel-
bourne. If a man’s name is Smith, he just calls
himself Smith as a rule. Rarely does he disguise
himself as “the new Jones of the Southern
Hemisphere,” or “the Wilkins of the South,” and
a city might as well follow the good example.
Justice Cohen, Justice O’Connor and
Justice Hoo'd, as Presidents of various descrip-
tions of Industrial Courts, all vacated their seats
without much ceremony. There was considerable
difficulty in inducing a Supreme Court Judge to
accept the N.S. W. position in the first instance,
and at present it is a District Court Judge who,
by a shuffle with the Arbitration Act, fills the
vacancy. A Judge, accustomed to the deferences
of the ordinary courts, finds an Arbitration Court
somewhat uncongenial. Then comment on de-
cisions is free and hearty, and his old sacrosanct
character is knocked about till it looks like a
bashed junior football.
The suggestion of the daily press to place
British Labor man Keir Hardie under police sur-
veillance when he arrives in Australia is supremely
silly. The only thing that Hardie wants is
to be shut out as an undesirable and horrible im-
migrant. But, unless the suggestion is repro-
bated, some Chief Secretary or other temporary
numskull may perpetrate the folly. When, during
the big_ strike, Labor man Thomas, of Broken
Hill, paid a visit to Queensland, Horace Tozer,
then Ministerial head of the police, ordered large,
conspicuous policemen to lumber ■ after him
wherever he went. And the worst they found
out about him was that he was a Methodist local
preacher who didn’t drink and hated tobacco.
Dr. Robert Scott, who recently died at
Summer Hill (Sydney), was a well-known figure
in Melbourne parsondoin some years'back. He
was an M. A. of Glasgow University, and
was appointed about 1880 to Chalmers’ Presby-
terian Church, East Melbourne, then one of the
most important “charges ”in those parts. Seven
years later he “got into holts” with his congrega-
tion about some church property, and threw up
not only his church but the whole sin-shifting
industry. Then though he was in sight of his half-
century, he went to Edinburgh to study medicine.
Having got his “ticket,” he returned in 1890, and
practised at Balmain and Redfern (N.S.W.). He
was aged 65 when he passed out.
There was a howl in Brisbane the other
day because “the Empire Cup,” won by a loc:il
Grammar School boy for an essay, was detained
for a few hours by the Customs, while inquiries
were made about it. The petty little Brisbane
Courier promptly jumped at the chance to sneer-
ingly ask the returning Queensland rifleman
Motton, winner of the Graphic Cup, whether he
intended paying duty on his trophy. It was a
very cheap sneer at the new tariff, though—a cheap
and ignorant sneer. For if the anti-Australian
Courier had read the thing it sneers at, it would
have known that “trophies won abroad” are
expressly exempt from duty.
Prahran (Yic.) Council has got itself dis-
liked by the contractors, who have hitherto been
doing the street cleaning, watering, etc., at
Bs. lOd. a day for a man. horse and diay. Hitherto
the council has obliged the contractors to make
sworn declaration that the men employed were
getting the minimum wage of 7s. a day, and the
contractors have always cheerfully sworn to that
effect. But lately the city surveyor smelt some-
thing, and got authority to himself pay the men
the 7s. a day and deduct the amount out of the
contract. And evidently the city surveyor’s nose
hadn’t deceived him, for the contractors there-
upon promptly threw up their undertaking and
forfeited their deposits.
The boycott by which the Melbourne
bakers won their strike was frenziedly condemned
by the Argus as an “immoral and wicked
weapon.” Two days later the same paper joy-
fully printed this letter from an alleged share-
holder in the Civil Service Co-operative Society,
which had sided with the men :
I have resolved for my part to have nothing to do with
the store for the future. . . I may mention that I am
in a position to secure for the store the custom of a large
institution, which would have been of considerable value
to the shareholders; but the store shall never have another
order from me.
Now, where’s the difference? Isn’t this also a
boycott ?
At this season of the year General Desire
is endeavoring to circumvent Ikey Mo. The old

D.C.L. the genial imbiber usually forms a wise
opinion as to the respective merits of the Cup
horses, and if he doesn’t back the actual winner,
he gets very near it. The D.C.L. line of reasoning
goes straight to the point. There are other
whiskies, of course, but this is the Whisky of the

From an old officer :
A late cable message tells how the Germans on the
r rench border have “ recast the plans of their fortresses,
because the old plans have been sold to the French.”
The Germans have surely taken a long time to And that
out—or the cable correspondent has. I have in my pos-
session a copy of the “Manuel de Fortification,” by
Plessix and Legendre, used as a text book in the French
Staff College. It contains elaborate plans of the fortifi-
cations of Metz, Strasburg, and Neu Breisach.- It even
gives detailed plans of some of the detached forts, and
has been in circulation for several years. The same book
contains plans of the fortifications of Portsmouth
(England) and Antwerp (Belgium), showing what non-
sense it is to tr.v to make a mystery of the general con-
struction of fortresses. Anyone who understands the
business can tell the general plan and construction of a
place by looking at it without making a drawing on the
ground.

PROGRESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The spirit of a new age has touched and changed the
English village life. —So we hear.
Progress has bumped the villages,
And changed their quiet ways.
They’re hustled from the simple life—
These are progressive days.
The village inn, whose landlord once
Was known good beer to sell,
Has gone ; and in its place there stands
The Mudtown Grand Hotel.
The village choir, so simple once,
Now knows the care and fret
And constant bickerings that stir
The highly-paid quartette.
The creamy milk, that once we got
When tramping through the vale,
Less creamy is, and not so fresh,
The water makes it pale.
The daffodils, that once bedecked
The country-side with gold,
Don’t do it now. They’re all packed up
In bunches, to be sold.
No longer on the village green
Is dance and gay hubbub,
But in the city hall they hold
“ The Pansy Quadrille Club.”
The harvest home, that once did show
The farmer kind and just,
Is held no more—because the crop
Is bought up by the Trust.
Under the spreading - chestnut tree
The smithy stands no more ;
A brand-new motor shop is there,
With “ Garage ” o’er the door.
It’s meet that it should happen thus ;
These are progressive days ;
If simple country life you’d see—
You GO AND WATCH TUB PLAYS.

EDWIN: “ Tell that man to go away at once.”
ANGLINA: “ Tell him yourself; he’s a perfect stranger to me.”
Police Magistrate Cresswell, of Melbourne,
fell on a ruffianly wife-beater lately with “one
month’s hard labor, with the second seven days
in solitary confinement.” It was such a shock
after the anticipated “10s. or three days,” that
the damaged wife didn’t recover her wits till the
court was just about to close. Then she earnestly
informed Cresswell that he was locking up
the sole support of herself and two babies.
And, as a matter of fact, that is just how
it stood ; the brutal wife-beater was going
to get shelter and food for four weeks, and
the woman, who had suffered too much already,
was going to drift away and starve. Still,
as the other magistrates had gone, Cresswell
couldn’t alter the sentence; and the best
he could do was to award the woman 10s.
a week out of the poor box. And even if
the other magistrates hadn’t gone, the law
wouldn’t have provided for the sensible thing—to
keep the husband hard at profitable work, and to
pay the wife the proceeds. It is a fool of a sys-
tem that condemns the offender to idleness and
the sufferer to hunger.
Instructive and touching is the story of
Lucy.Louch, who got a month with difficult toil
at Sta well (Vic.), tlieother day, for imposing upon

Lucy, attired as a nurse and wearing an expres-
sion of pallid resignation and a pair of appealing
blue eyes, went up and down the State,

The Law in Victoria has just been intro-
duced to an unusual sort of “crime”-—viz., the
forging of a petition for a prisoner’s release. A
few years back one Quigley, having grossly
broken the law in the matter of a female school-
teacher, a perfect stranger, was ordered to be
hanged. The executive, however, altered this to
10 years’ “ hard.” Since Quigley’s incarceration,
petitions for release have drifted into the Crown
Law Office at the rate of about two a year. The
department proving obdurate, a fresh petition
arrived the other day bearing the school-teacher
victim's name, and setting out that, as “she was
quite satisfied with the punishment the prisoner
had received, it would do no harm to release
him.” The department maintained its obdurate
attitude, and notified the young woman to that
effect, whereupon she promptly replied that she
didn’t knojv what the fuss was about—she had
made no appeal, and, in fact, wasn’t in the least
interested in the prisoner. Then the department
inquired, and discovered that the sender of the
bogus petition was a 13-year-old niece of the
prisoner, who seems to have an idea that her
uncle, if released, will assist a very straitly-
circumstanced family to keep its head above
water. The Law is understood to be considering
whether it will prosecute the 13-year-old niece or
not; but it is safe to bet that it won’t. Those
petitions for release are a very delicate subject,
and a searching enquiry into such matters would
be very awkward for some people.

N.S.W. Speaker McCourt had many
bouquets thrown at him on his re-election,
Wade, in his undertaker’s fashion, wreathed the
Speaker with immortelles and cypress, and hung
rue upon him, and said how sorry they all were
that McCourt was dead. At least that was the
effect of it; the thud of the clod of eulogy upon
the coffin of McCourt was audible all down
Maequarie-street. Then Wade bogged in at
carving McCourt’s tombstone, and fixing up his
epitaph, and finally he drove the empty hearse
home weeping bitterly as he went. Then McGowen
had a turn at McCourt, and left people thinking
that he and Mac. had made boilers together in their
younger days. And finally Storey leaped to the
front as the tame wallaby leaps on the dining table
when dinner is just laid—onb could hear Storey's
tail getting into the soup —and smote his chest,
and said that the Speaker had crept into their
hearts, and that if he were only half as large as
their opinion of him all the hats in Storey’s
hattery rolled into one hat would merely balance
on one hair of McCourt’s head ; and he said they
would all rally round McCourt, and would die for
him if necessary (or, even if it wasn’t necessary,
they would do it for ornament), same as the
Scottish spearmen at Flodden, or that almost-
forgotten Austrian who rose up with 800 militia
and told a Sultan and 150,000 men to come on,
and added that the Sultan’s parents weren’t
married. It was a great time ; and if McCourt
can ever borrow from the House even 2s. in the £
of what the House seemed ready to lend him last
week, he will never want for some beer and a crust.

Australian Chief-Justice Griffith has been
talking some good horsehair sense on his native
Brisbanelieath. A man had been charged with doing
something in Mel bourne-street, and it happened
that the place where he did it wasn’t Melbourne-
street, that street having stopped being Mel-
bourne-street a few yards back and become
Victoria-place; whereupon the magistrates had
observed a fatal defect in the proceedings, and
acted accordingly. Apparently, also, other
Courts had applauded the magistrates’ keen
faculty for standing a hair on end and splitting
it, and then judging the hog by the hair that they
had found hanging to the beast. When Chief-
Justice Griffith considered the hog and the hair
relatively, he turned up section 48 of the Justices
Act—
No objection shall be taken or allowed to any com-
plaint ... for any alleged defect therein in substance or in
form, or for any variance between it and the evidence in
support thereof, and any such variance shall be amended
by order of the Justices at the hearing.
And a very disgusted C. J. asked what in thunder
magistrates thought Parliament passed sections
like that for if it wasn’t to prevent them making
asses of themselves, as they had done in this case.

Adelaide is a little puzzled over the case of
Emil Benda, a popular little Frenchman, and, till
lately, a leading tobacconist. Three years ago,
bad times coming upon him, he put a bullet into
his head, and it stayed there, though without any
lasting result (apparently). However, he has now
been arrested by a compatriot who had discounted
for him several hundreds of pounds’ worth of bills
bearing the names of prominent merchants. All
of them were wild and reckless forgeries. Benda
has been sent for six years’ hard labor. Certainly
he ought to be under restraint, but the quarries of
the Stockade hardly seem the proper place
treatment of such a case. His imitations of the
signatures of well-known citizens looked about as
much like a serious attempt at the real thing as
George Lauri’s famous imitation of Goliath of
Gath.

Ah, why should there be bitterness within Australian

What cause for loud distrust is here —what heed for wild

What’s got this young Australian chap, this crazy cuss

Dear B.—Rev. E. H. Sugden, M. A., one-time
henchman to the now-exploded Berruther Woggle,
has written “ a hymn of welcome to the delegates
to the ninth biennial Australasian Christian
Endeavor Convention.” Sugden is a humorous,
little pink chap, who wouldn’t la'll a fly except
with bis mouth, yet, as usual, he waves his little
legs in the face of the sun an : welcomes the
delegates with this —
Send a note of challenge
To the hosts of Hell,
Louder and yet louder
Let the trumpet swell,
Uttering our defiance
Of their utmost might;
With their listed legions
To the death we’ll fight.
Great poet is Sugden, and so indefinite that even
if he and his Convention do nothing, the pillars
of the Church who want Christian Endeavor as
much as anybody will find no offence. I think
I’ll enter for the second prize myself—

Shriek and tear your hair 1
Alter the Equator

Make no shocking charges,
’Gainst|,he callous great!
Utter y.dur defiance —
Dauntless everywhere—
Of the lame blackbeetle—
If he’s small and spare.
Rise up in your might, then,
’Gainst the “ Hosts of Hell.”

“D.M.W.”: The Dominion newspaper
got out in Wellington on Dominion Day. A
lino, blew out on the night before, and later on
the machine started chewing up paper in great
style. However, the print got out by noon, and
a motor-car was engaged to deliver it to agents
round the town. Out of pure cussedness the
motor broke down and wouldn’t go. The fact is
that the stars in their courses fight against the
establishment of a Tory paper in Maoriland. All
the same, the literary staff of the concern is doing
well, and nothing very Tory has yet shown itself.
Maoriland could do with a newspaper. It has an
astonishing number of things printed, but——

“ J.G.” : Magdalene and her sisters Tottie
and Flossie are drifting hack to their old homes in
■“Lon ” and “Little Lon,” in Melbourne, and the
people who were responsible for the breaking up
of the hilarious family are not making any fresh
move towards dispersion. They begin to realise
that it is better to allow the Ten Tribes of Tottie
to congregate in one recognised quarter of the
city than to have them scattered broadcast over
the whole State. Tregear, Woodfull, and the
rest need not enter the tainted quarter unless
they like, and no harm will be done to their
morals if they carefully avoid the dangerous
locality. But when a fool beak like Panton
scatters the wicked all over the place, it is always
possible that Tregear or Woodfull, going to appa-
rently. respectable houses, in most respectable
localities, to deliver tracts and L.O.L. literature,
may happen on Flossie, and be hugged in de-
rision before he can tear himself from her warm,
plump arms, and flee for the gate, calling wildly
tfor the police and the fire-engine to come and
arrest and extinguish Flossie.

A good many days have passed since the
last bad accident on Tait’s Victorian railways,
and the cause thereof still remains a mystery. In
a general way, however, people set it down in
part to over-lavish economy in the matter of
repairs. The rest of the responsibility is laid to
the fact that the driver was new, and didn’t know
the road, and took a down-grade at too great a
speed. Anyhow, an engine and 19 trucks fled in
a great comprehensive 30ft. leap into a creek,
killing the driver and guard under circumstances
of which the less said the better. The Argus
remarks that “the spot where the fatality
occurred is a dangerous one, and travellers on the
hue have often expressed doubts about it.” Tra-
vellers are still expressing doubts, and even the
bulkiness of the beautiful surplus doesn’t make
these doubts any less. It takes a wonderful
number of bad spots to make a surplus sometimes.

“Maori Mac”: The Maoriland police—
except when in pursuit of a large pewter pot—are
about the slowest things outside the Great Tor-
toise Handicap. Their casualness is a subject of
wonder. In 1891 a man named Coker was sum-
moned to appear at the Christchurch court to
answer a charge of child desertion. Owing to
pressure of business, or some other cause, Coker
did not appear ; but, having mooned around for a
bit, he drifted out of the Cathedral township.
Apparently the police did nothing but wonder
vaguely re the whereabouts of their lost friend.
Coker brought up at Wanganui, where he engaged
in business with some success. Sixteen years
after the summons, he returned to Christchurch.
Somebody with a long memory recognised him,
and informed one of the local Sherlock Holmes
push, and Sherlock quickly found quite a number
of clues. So Coker was arrested and ordered
six months’ imprisonment, which filled him with
■such wild surprise that he had hardly begun to
protest before he found that he had started serv-
ing his sentence.

“ Flinderino ” : A “ Woman’s Letter ” (B.
12/9/’O7), in a paragraph about artist Streeton and
picture-buyers, scoffs at Fisherman’s Bend as a
Melbourne beauty spot. Let me state right here
that Fisherman’s Bend is a beauty spot. But
nine out of every, ten persons in Melbourne do
not know that such a place exists. This little
fishing village nestles behind clumps of tea-tree
and hillocks of sand and marram grass, on
the shore of Hobson’s Bay, between the
Port Melbourne piers and the entrance
to the Yarra. There are no streets —
just a collection of fishermen’s
cottages scattered promiscuously
on the beach in picturesque con-
fusion. The fishing nets hanging
along the front fences, and the
schooner - rigged clothes - lines,
suggest Yarmouth beach with
old Mr. Peggotty’s boathouse
in the distance. Any fine
morning one can stroll along
the shingle and watch the
brine-hardened toilers hauling
in the nets, or yarn with old
Crayfish Dan as he tars the
upturned Saucy Jane, and, at the same time,
listen to the melodious voice of the Australian
skylark ; for at no other place is our lark, more
plentiful or more melodious than at Fisherman’s
Bend.

“Jimmie Pannikin”: Some time ago I
applied to the council of the Public Service Asso
ciation to send me a box of magazines for a lonely
little bush school. My request was granted ; but
one mernber of the said council made a song about
a wee slice of slang, that put life and color into
my letter, written, by the way, at racing speed.
I sent the peculiar purist the following remarks
concerning slang, by H. A. Beers, Professor of
English Literature in Yale College (U.S.A.), but
received no reply. Please print the vigorous and
right remarks for the benefit of other thin-
blooded tinklers :
Schoolmasters’ English—the English which boys writ-
ing themes are taught to use—is carefully denuded of all
peculiarities, and among other things which it holds in
horror is slang. Pedants, prigs, purists, precisians, and
all dry-witted and thin-witted persons naturally hate
slang, because it is alive. But men of rich natures love
slang. It is the wild game of language. It abounds in
imagination, humor, strength, comes warm from the lips
of the people, and is the fresh product of the creative
impulses by which all language was originally made.
“Kaban ” : How is it that the authorities
who exercise control over suburban stables
and hen-houses don’t visit the 'establishment of
E. W. Cole in Bourke-street, Melbourne? Cole’s
second-hand department is practically the only
place of its kind in the City, atari those who love
to fossick among old books itaust perforce ascend
his winding stair. Now the smell of musty
volumes is Unpleasant enough by itself, but why
should the perfume and whiff of monkeys be
thrown in ? The Cole menagerie opens off the
stairway, and the result is disheartening, to say
the least. The monkey may smell pleasantly
enough in his native forest, but monkey in a shop
is unwholesome and an abomination. The
brother whose tail hangs down behind should be
chased outside the city limits.
FROM CLOUDS TO BEDROCK.
OWNER (publicly): “ Now, my boy, look to your priming! Don't be too eager to forestall the event! Keep a stout heart! Play your own game

The Kedron (Q.) Shire Council got out
of the rut lately when it was devising its new
by-laws, and provided for a £5 tax on pea-rifles.
But Premier Kidston looked first at the long list
of pea-rifle fatalities, and then turned his thoughts
north, where Australia’s trouble threatens to
come from, and sorrowfully took a blue pencil and
pushed the shire council back into the rut. So
Kedron won’t have its by-law after all. A pea-
rifle may not kill at 2000yds.; but it will probably
lead the youngster to presently handle a rifle that
can do so if it is held straight.
OVERHEARD AT GRAND OPERA.
HE: “ I like comic opera."
SHE:" But this isn't comic opera.”
HE: “It would seem comic to you if you had

The sailing ship Port Jackson, which last
year brought out from England 100 boys who
were learning to be officers in the Bull marine, has
started on another trip. But though billets were
found, or promised, for the whole of the former
lot of marine students, the Port Jackson, on this
voyage, musters less than 50 cadets. Public sup-
port is scarce, and Bull, junior, is still quitting
the sea. The a venues of promotion are narrow in a
ship officer’s life, the pay is small and the life is hard.
A boy cannot get a master’s ticket until he is 21;
as a matter of fact, few can qualify for it until
about 25. Almost every big passenger line, and
a good few of the best tramp lines, refuse to give
a man a berth even as second mate unless he
holds a master’s ticket, and has served three or
four years in sailing vessels. Lately the com-
panies have been perhaps a shade less ferocious in
their insistence upon previous service in wind-
jammers, but the relief hasn’t amounted to much.
Then the pay of a second or first mate, even of a
P. and O. liner, is not worth the slavery involved
in rising to that giddy eminence. And by reason
of these things a famine in brass-bounders seems
to be quite within sight.

Children when teething have more or less
diarrhoea, which cannot be checked effectually,
as the cause cannot be removed, but the diarrhoea
can and should be controlled by giving Chamber-
lain’s Colic, Cholera, and Diarrhoea Remedy, and
an occasional dose of castor oil to cleanse the
system.* ...
“ Sail ” : Was quite surprised, the Othet
day, to see in a paper that several Sydney
firms had been fined for allowing srhoke to issue
from their chimneys fob htore than a certain
number of minutes. One restaurant-keeper was
fined £2 for permitting thick smoke and soot to
pour from his funnel. Why, I have often noticed
soot coming into the room where I stoke-up at
midday, and settling in black masses on the plates
and tablecloth, and it always seemed the right
thing to expect. The waiter just flicked the dirt
off with his napkin, and remarked that “they’re
pretty bad to-day, sir.” There seems to be no
end to interference with private industry these
times. The Government will overdo it yet.
“ 10-2-4 ” (Sydney) writes :
Was favored last week with a view of the new
beach-bathing garment. The dress is neat without being
gaudy ; and to say merely that it is going to be efficient
from a moral standpoint is to state the case with miser-
able inadequacy. G. Reid could sun-bathe in this costume
and not look indecent. It is constructed throughout of some
strong, rugged serge-like substance. The entire body of the
swimmer will be enveloped, barring the head, face, hands
and feet. (Side-stunts which are earnestly recommended
—though they are not compulsory—are list boots reach-
ing well up the calf, and a woven eye-holed headpiece
having the appearance of the cap worn by the person who
is about to be obliterated by the last officer of the law.)
The would-be bather climbs into his new acquisition at
the back, and it is then fastened from behind by four
large bone buttons like dinner plates. There is also an
emergency lacing apparatus in case one or more of the
dinner-plates should come off. Surmounting all is the
triumphant and distinguishing mark of the costume, the
product of the combined intellects of the local coun-
cillors, assisted by the Mayor. A giant lampshade
a ballet dancer’s skirt, B. Smith’s frock-coat, a tariff
wall, all these things it suggests ; but none of them long.
It is in its own class. There is nothing else quite like it
on earth ; nor ever will be. In pleats and folds it droops
from the bather’s tummy, around which organ it is lashed,
to far below his knees, making of him a human calamity
that an African tree-dweller would heave bricks at and a
Jud weep joyous tears over. The new bathing garb is
great. It is unique. Someone ought to be drowned
in connection with it.

Advt. from London Morning Post : “ A
nobleman by descent (mother’s side), thirty-five,
single, but not of means, is harassed by plebeians.
Will any fellow-bloodsman help?” There is
something magnificent about the term “ fellow-
bloodsman.”
Says Dr. E. M. Inglis, health officer of
Kew (Vic.) municipality :
To my mind, the most likely cause of the continuance
of typhoid in Kew Asylum is the asylum rule or custom
which makes the patients use the dormitories as eating
rooms.
We should think ! If Thomas Bent was required
by law to have his breakfast in his bedroom as a
regular thing he would probably resign the
Premiership in disgust. And many a decent
lunatic doubtless feels inclined to resign his job
as an idiot and an insane madman for the same
reason.
Queensland, which includes so much of
that north country “where the white man can’t
live,” again came out top of the Australian death-
rate list last year. Of every 10,000 Victorians
124 provided another little job for the undertaker;
in N. S. Wales, 99 ; in Queensland, only 95. So
the further north you got the further you edged
from the grave. The grave lies down south. The
death rates of the cities tell the same tale.
Hobart, the southernmost city, has by far the
worst record among the capitals—l 73 per 10,000,
as against Brisbane’s 100. Unless the officials are
most outrageous liars, it is a lot easier to live in
the north than it is in the south.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
According to American reckoning — and the
U.S. Mint is probably the first; authority on the subject—
the world’s gold output last year was valued at
£82,292,149. In 1896 it was £41,713,715, so in 10 years
the output has all-but doubled. If there is any substance
at all in the theory on which the bimetallists built their
pretty castles a few years ago, this remarkable increase
in gold-production must affect prices in the way of send-
ing them up and keeping them up. In other words, the
phenomenal increase in the stock of gold must cheapen
that metal, which means that the world must give more
of it for a bale of wool or a ton of copper. To that extent
the average of old prices—say for copper, lead, or wool —
isn’t a reliable guide to probable future prices.
There has been a remarkable increase in prices,
anyway and however caused. Take as a basis the average
London prices, in 1901, f.o.b. Sydney, for the principal
Australian articles of export. CaA that basis 1000. Then,
according to the calculations of the N.S.W. Bureau of
Statistics, the average for last year was 1277; and
for August, 1907, it was 1313. Pastoral products have
advanced rather less and mineral products rather more
than the average. An advance like this plays chiefly into
the hands of adebtor country like Australia. On account
of the increase in prices of its articles of export, Australia
could now repay £1,000,000 of its debt as easily asin 1901 it
could have repaid £761,000 of it. That is one tremendous
reason why the present run of very high prices should be
seized upon to get out of the hands of the foreign creditor ;
with one ton of lead, for instance, Australia can, if it
seizes the opportunity, pay off as much debt as a few
years ago it could have paid off with two tons—and quite
likely as much as it will be able to pay off with two tons
in the future.
Even if the debt is converted from foreign into
Australian, something considerable is gained ; and in that
respect Victoria has been doing very well. Since Federa-
tion, its foreign liability has been decreased by £5,017,544;
the Melbourne liability has been increased by £8,050,258.
In other words, £3,032,714 of new debt has been incurred
and taken up in Melbourne, and £5,017,544 of old debt
has been bought from J. Bull Oohen and transferred to
Australian creditors.
* * * *
As the N. S. Wales Government has really to
pay only one-fourth (or less than one-fourth) of the duty
on the imported wire netting (it pays the four-fourths,
but the Australian Government hands back three-fourths
or more), State Ministers have decided only to charge the
farmers the one-fourth. Carruthers might have done
that from the start, but it didn’t suit his book ; he
wouldn’t then have been able, for election purposes, to
weep over the “ poor farmer,” and rave against the Aus-
tralian Government. But the most interesting feature
about the matter is the way the daily papers, which
helped Carruthers to rave, take the new decision.
“No merchant holding wire netting could do like-
wise, and in that way they are penalised,” says
the Sydney Telegraph. And it remarks that things
like this “ would shut up the importers,” where-
fore the whole business is abominable, and “ will not bear
looking into.” And this is the farmers’ friend! The
other day it nearly had hysterics because the “poor
farmer ” had to pay duty on wire-netting ; to-day, when
the Government says that he needn’t pay three-fourths
of the duty, it has hysterics again, and demands that he
should pay the whole duty lest some blessed importer
should suffer tuppence. It is the importer that really
matters; the “poor farmer” —well, he’s just good
enough to use as a tool for election purposes.
Now it is Portugal whose Government has
tired of seeing the country drained by foreign insurance
cos., without even getting from them any guarantee
that they will pay up if a disaster should strike them and
the country ; wherefore anew law' requires (1) a sub-
stantial deposit from every co. ; (2) a share in the profits.
At latest 33 cos., mostly English and American, were
filling Lisbon with their buzz, and assuring the Prime
Minister that the time was not ripe. Time seems every-
where to have that old habit of keeping perpetually green.
The Westralian Government has been roped in
for a loan of £35,000, nominally at 4 per cent., by the big
northern cattle men, to be put into freezing and canning
works at Wyndham or thereabouts. There is a pile of
money behind the crowd—the “ meat ring ” in the West
has filled their pockets—but they are not game to risk
the full cost of the works; so the Government is going to
put up half and stand out of interest for three years to
give the concern a start. If the ithing is a failure, as
mortgagee the State will have the scrap iron ; and if it is a
success, the State will get only the 4 per cent, that it will
have to itself pay for the money. From a business point
of view, it isn’t a glittering bargain. The Government
can’t possibly make a profit, and it stands a very good
chance of miking a loss. A 2 per cent, sinking fund is
provided for—and that’s all right, except perhaps
that in connection with very perishable works of
this kind it ought to be 3 per cent. But
the Westralian Government’s disgraceful conduct with
regard to the Goldfields Water Supply sinking fund
makes one suspicious. Mainly to furnish foreign mine-
owners with cheap water the Government carried out
this great undertaking, which was to provide a 3 per
cent, sinking fund ; but as soon as the money had been
spent, and the water was available, the Government
allowed the mineowners to squeeze it into reduced water-
rates, with the result that the Government has now to
dip into the pocket of the general taxpayer for the whole
of the sinking fund.
* * « *
The offer, so far as it goes, to provide the Vic-
torian Government with all the iron and steel it wants
“ at prices not higher than those of the imported article,”
comes from the New Direct Process Iron, Steel, and
Metals Corporation, which has the use of the Heskett-
Moore patents. The offer was made through Earle Her-
man. The corporation asks for a seven years’ contract
at current prices—no more. Earle Herman added in
a letter to Premier Bent—“ Thus the Government
is assured of its supplies of iron and steel pro
duced in the State, from Australian ores, up to-
the standard required by the Government.” Unfor-
tunately, it isn’t assured of anything of the sort.
When William Sandford got a contract in N. S. Wales he
was called upon to put up £SOOO as evidence that he would
do what he undertook. That was some guarantee. A
still greater guarantee was that he had been making
some iron—from “ scrap,” chiefly—for a quarter of a
century, and had the substantial part of a plant capable
of doing the Government work. The new co. has only
an experimental plant, and it mentions nothing about
guarantees. The process may be all right. But what
needs to be pasted on the cruet-stand on this country’s
lunch-table is that, if it fails, that fact won’t cast the
smallest reflection upon Australia’s ability to make its
own iron and steel. It will simply reflect upon a patent
process that the iron and steel makers of Europe and
America don’t use. Victoria’s Premier Bent is under-
stood, however, to be “ favorably disposed.” Possibly he
isn’t any less “ favorably disposed” because the co. men-
tions that Altona is the place where it would like to
establish its works.
* * * «
The usual meeting has been held at Cobar to
protest against the tariff iniquity. “ Mr. Blakemore, of
the Great Oobar, Ltd., said that in the case of the new
furnace and converter plant, it was impossible to
get this built in Australia.” Why? Where did Mt.
Morgan get its converter plant built ? The only reason
why it is “ impossible ” to get the Cobar plant
built in Australia is that “the makers refuse to even sell
the plans.” Well, then, the Great Cobar can get plans
also built in Australia. R. Shepherd prepared the plans
for the Morgan works. Later on he put up a converter
plant at the 0.K., in remote North Queensland;
and, in spite of the handicaps, it is as effective a
plant as foreign-director Kendall, of Great Cobar,
will send out to General Manager Blakemore. Moreover,
the chances are that the imported plant, made according
to stock plans, will be a good deal less effective—and will
certainly cost more money—than a plant which Blakemore
could provide himself with in Australia. On this ques-
tion of ineffective imported machinery, by the way, even
the Foreign-trade members of the Tariff Commission were
driven to make an astounding confession : “ There was a
great deal of imported machinery purchased for working
Westralian properties which was never used.” In most
cases it couldn’t be used. It was the same at Broken
Hill; imported managers imported vast quantities of
stuff that had to be promptly scrapped, and Australian-
made articles, suited to the special conditions, were sub-
stituted. G. H. Blakemore knows—he had to do some
of the scrapping.
The Cobar meeting of mine-owners was shocked
also at the effect of the 2s. duty on Oregon. “ Mr. W. J.
Hogan, chairman of the Occidental, said that the pro-
hibitive duty could have but one effect; it would come
back on the worker by decreasing the sources of
employment.” The last available report of the Occidental
shows that the timber bill was about £l5O for the six
months. That was at Cobar. Supposing the Occi-
dental used all Oregon, which it doesn’t, the value for
Customs purposes would be about £SO (the £l5O in-
cludes railway freight, etc.); and the 2s. per 100 ft.
duty on that quantity would amount to less
than £ls. Or take the Broken Hill Prop., the
biggest mining user of timber in Australia. In an average
half-year its mine-timber bill now is £25,000. The output
of ore is 300,000 tons. So if the duty were calculated
on this whole amount of £25,000 (which it isn’t),
and if it averaged 25 per cent, (and it
doesn’t), the duty would amount to a whole five-
pence per ton of ore. Moreover, “logs not sawn” and
“ spars in the rough ” are duty free ; so if the cos. want
to escape this ghastly extra duty, which probably
amounts on the average to quite two-pence per ton of
ore,, they can do it by importing Oregon logs and giving
Australian sawmillers a job.

This State office was established late in 1896 to assist
farmers, and was organised as a branch of the Savings
Bank. The funds are provided by the sale of mortgage
bonds and debentures, some at 3, some at 3J per cent.
The discount at which these loans were issued was passed
into the balance-sheet as an asset. Of course it is not an
asset—it is simply something that the bank didn’t get,
but yet will have to pay back. The total discounts have
been £26,595 ; so far the bank itself has written off
£11,021 out of profits, leaving £15,574 of a paper asset in
the balance-sheet. In the table at the top of these re-
marks this has been deducted from the reserves shown
in the accounts, leaving £46,625 of true reserves.
The advances paid off during the year have ex-
ceeded the total of the new advances. Largely, this is
due to the fact that much less than the average number
of applications have been made for new advances ; the
total for the year was 550, as compared with 788 in the
previous 12 months, and 689 in 1905. Possibly this may
be due to the fact that times have been good and
assistance has not been required ; more likely it is due to
the fact that there have been ridiculously few new
farmers in Victoria—ridiculously, few considering the
area of the land locked up in big, poorly-used holdings.
Money outside this bank has also been cheap, and it has
been cheap for the farmer largely by reason of
the competition of this State bank, which makes
advances to him on very easy terms at 4£
p.c. For a while it had to charge 4f p.c.,
because in 1904 the bank had to pay £4 2s. Id. per cent,
for the money it u'as itself borrowing ; but the lending
rate has again been reduced to the old 4J per cent,
standard. So far, then, as this bank has forced other
banks into accommodating farmers at low rates, the full
service of this State institution to “ the backbone of the
country ” isn’t manifest in the published figures. Many
an Anti-Socialistic cocky who is paying the private shark
4£ per cent, for money which he could not have got till
recently for less than 7 per cent., doesn’t know his real
debt to this little bit of Socialism.
Eor one reason and another, therefore, the
year’s figures are not particularly satisfactory. For
instance: —

1907 .. 1,251,051 8506 13 7 „
The advances outstanding include £423 which repre-
sents the whple of the properties in possession—
extremely satisfactory figures. Certainly this isn’t the
time when one looks for heavy and persistent arrears and
foreclosures ; they come, if they come at all, when times
are bad, and especially when bad times come after a
period of great prosperity and puffed-up values. Conse-
quently the fairly rapid growth of the reserves is a feature
of interest—they may be wanted some day. Anyhow,
whether they will be actually wanted or not they ought
to be there in case they are wanted.
While, therefore, the Victorian State Land
Bank can’t afford to lend at less than it has been doing—
the additions to reserves being none too large—by more
co-operation on the part of Victorian farmers who
need accommodation the lending -rate might in
course of time be brought down certainly to 4£
per cent, and probably to 4 per cent. The Maoriland
State Land Bank is in no better position to borrow,
and therefore ought to be in no better position
to lend. Yet because it had £3,551,876 out in
advances on March 31, 1907, its total management
expenses last year were only 4s. 9d. per cent, of advances.
It, therefore, could afford, on that account alone, to let
farmers have money at Bs. per cent, less interest than the
figure at which the Victorian bank can afford to do it.
This is one benefit that even the present Victorian farmers
will get from the sub-division of land in that State ; the
multiplication of those farmers, by the same processes
that have been adopted in Maoriland, will, or ought to,
mean bigger business for the State Land Bank, and that
in its turn will mean a lower rate for management ex-
penses ; and the borrowers will ultimately get the benefit
of that in reduced interest.

Bad luck is striking this co. in large lumps. First there
was the trouble over the Life funds. For many years the
shareholders had been pocketing the surpluses from the
old Life department. But two or three years ago the
law was invited to consider the matter, and Chief Justice
Madden delivered a judgment which would have involved
the repayment of over £113,000. Further appeals were
talked of, and as nearly everybody interested was old and
tired and didn’t want to be disturbed at dinner, a compro-
mise was arranged, at a cost to the shareholders of £55,521.
But that was only in the way of refund. The other part
of the cost will show up in future accounts ; for one
source of the shareholders’ profits has now been stopped.
Still the Life policy-holders don’t get all the profits of
their branch ; 25 per cent, still goes to shareholders. But
for that, things would look worse than they do for the
past year. The three branches (apart from Life) worked
out for the 12 months in this way :
Fire Profit .. £2746
Marine Loss .. 8693
Guarantee and accident Profit .. 2021
Net Loss .. £3926
An opportune investigation of the Life branch disclosed
profits of which the shareholders’ proportion amounted
to £3024 ; and that and interest earnings turned the loss
into the profit of £3762 shown above.
Combining the fire and marine business, these
results are reached :

The marine business, which, on the whole, hasn’t been
very profitable for years, has lately been more unprofit-
able than usual. The losses mopped up all the pre-
miums and 9 per cent, besides ; and in the fire branch
they were 53 per cent., which is a stiff rate, considering
that fire-insurance business —which is made up of a vast
number of small premiums—is more expensive to manage
than the marine branch, where the premiums arrive in
large slices.

But those last two bracketed lines call for an explanation.
As mentioned just now, an investigation of this branch
was made recently, and certain profits were ascertained,
derived no doubt from the usual sources- —excess of interest
earnings over those reckoned upon when the premium
tables were drawn up, and the greater vitality of the
policy-holders, so that they are paying up premiums
longer than was calculated upon. But while the totals
due respectively to the policy-holders (75 per cent.) and
the shareholders (25 per cent.) have been arrived at, the
policy-holders’ profits have not yet been cut up. The
snareholders’“ cut ” —£3o24—has in the foregoing been
added to the expenses ; the special bonus (£9661) due
to policy-holders, and which they may draw, has
been added to claims, though presumably the
bonuses need not be drawn in cash, in which
case the money falls back to swell the assurance
fund. The interest credited to this branch is £BO3I
(added to this are a few pounds of recoveries from
amounts written off). On the average of the assurance
fund, that means £3 16s. 6d. per cent. The assets rep-
resenting shareholders’ funds and the assurance fund are
not distinguished in the balance sheet; but as £205,371,
or 49 per cent, of all the assets, is on mortgage, it looks
as though there might be some over-valuation somewhere.

This co., like so many more trustee cos., gives the public
a very poor idea of what is going on inside. Possibly,
shareholders can obtain a better view by getting close up
to the directors and manager, and probing them. But,
after all, shareholders are really as small potatoes in con-
nection with a trustee co. as the shareholders are in con-
nection with a bank; for £1 of their money, the co.
handles probably £2O or £IOO of other people’s money.
This co. in years back made large losses ; in 1903-4 it wrote
off £11,397. As in 1902 its reserves were only £9702, it is
pretty obvious that it had previously lost some of its capi-
tal. In other words, it is pretty certain that it didn’t
have a penny of the reserves it was supposed to have, and
didn’t have all the capital it had paid up ; and that isn’t
the sort of thing that ought to happen in connection
with any trustee co. It is an argument for much more
publicity than most of the cos. give. It is not certain
even now that the reserves are real; for 40 per cent, of
the assets are advances on mortgage “at book value ”
and when “ book value ” appears in a balance-sheet it re-
calls unpleasant things. And since the receipts from
commissions and interest are lumped, it isn’t possible to
even test the quality of the assets by the standard of the
return they are giving. From the clients’ point of view,
a satisfactory feature is the uncalled capital of £220,000 ;
and a sword of that size hanging over shareholders’ heads
is very liable to check imprudent habits.

In 1902—five years ago—the society altered the form of
its balance-sheet. Up to that time it had lumped into
one line all its advances, “ including properties which have
fallen into the hands of the society.” In 1902 loans bearing
full interest were separated from the foreclosures. Since
then things have moved like this :
Deposits, F'ore- Other
etc. Advances, closures. Assets.
1902 .. £12,616 £51,854 £68,857 £IBOB
1905 .. 12,229 59,172 54,245 3678
1906 .. 12,545 67,007 48,189 964
1907 .. 16,399 73,473 44,105 1087
So in the past five years this society has, on these figures,
got rid of £24,752 of the old trouble. Probably it has
really got rid of more, because some additional properties
may have fallen into the melting pot meantime. The
losses on these sales have been provided out of a contin-
gency fund, reckoned in with the reserves in the first table
above. At the end of 1902 this fund stood at £24,979 ;it
stands now at £13,410, so apparently the foreclosures
which have been realised have brought in £11,569 less
than they stood at in the books. At that rate the
£44,105 now in the books would be really worth about
£23,600. The directors mention in their report that
during the year “ 11 properties were sold for £2860,” and
£1424 was lost on realisations during the year. If that
means that £4284 (book value) realised £2860, the recent
average has been a little better than the five years’
average. The new business creeps up steadily, and it
hasn’t so far meant heavier management expenses ; five
years ago the management items totalled £1448, while
for last year they were £1446. Deposits are still moderate
compared with capital; and, though there is still con-
siderable cleaning-up to do, fair progress has been made
both as to that and in the matter of new business.

This is a shock—something is actually added to the poor
little reserves at last ! And it is not because the ad-
vances have increased ; on the contrary, they are smaller
now than they have been for some years. Evidently,
however, they are better. The total of these advances is
now £32,643 ; twelve months ago they were £34,508, so
there has been a reduction of £1865. But, of course, old
advances of a not very profitable sort may have been
realised to a much greater extent than that; the £1865 is
the net reduction. The reserves are poor ;as against
that the one satisfactory feature is that the money in the
business is mostly the shareholders’. Deposits and
accrued interest total only £4214, and there are cash
items of £4488 on the other side, so there is absolutely
nothing for the depositors to worry about —unless it be
that the society probably won’t want their money much
longer unless advances show up better.

If the society can’t do better than it has done during the
year, it wasn’t worth while having the recent re-ebristen-
ing ; it could have been buried just as comfortably under
the old name, and it would have cost a few pence less to
have the shorter name printed on the coffin. Certainly
where there was a loss there is now 1 a profit; but
that hasn’t arisen from an extension of busi-
ness. It is simply the result of cutting down
expenses. Things are at a standstill ; the society is
merely nursing or slowly realising a handful of properties,
taken over from the old society, and if that is all it pro-
poses to do, shareholders had better meet and decide
whether they can’t get some more pushing concern to
take over their assets.

The mining share-markets are in a state of
nervous collapse. Copper and tin have tumbled with the
metal market; and silver-lead has been sagging for some
weeks. There were two reasons for that. (1) Speculators
found themselves overloaded, and something had to go.
The something that had suffered least was silver-lead, so
that was thrown on the market to raise the wind. (2) In
general, speculators had no hope that lead would stand
up while all other metals fell. Yet, though the market
had thus discounted a lead slump, when it actually began
to happen there was a rush into the market on
the part of those who hadn’t thought about the
matter till the news in the papers hit them and
woke them up. For a month past lead has
been hanging around £2l. At the middle of last week it
was still £2l 2s. 6d. By the end of the week it had been
sold for forward delivery at £lB 155.; or £l9 ss. prompt
delivery. Broken Hill Prop., 68s. a month ago, fell to
595. ; Souths (paid) from £6 12s. to £4 19s. ; Sulphide
Corporation from 15s. to 10s. 6d. ; and others in pro-
portion.

By sweeping up industriously, and including
the hands employed at experimental mills, Broken Hill
counted up 10,000 mine employees for the first time on
September 30 ; this is exclusive of the men engaged at
reduction works at Pt. Pirie and elsewhere. The total
moves up and down with the price of lead, like this :

Last month Broken Hill South Blocks turned
out £13,155 worth of concentrates, taking lead at £2O
12s. 3d. and silver at 2s. 9Jd. Costs ran to £7834, leaving
a profit of £5321. There were 1497 tons concentrates,
assaying 6ty per cent, lead and 3Joz. silver. That works
out at 917 tons lead and 48650 z. silver. At the average
metal figures quoted for the month, this output would be
worth about £19,560 ; so that, as the output is stated to
have been actually worth £13,155 to the co., the buyers
have deducted about £4 7s. 6d. per ton of concentrates to
cover smelting and realisation charges, etc. The co.’s
profit—£s32l on 917 tons of lead—was at the rate of £5
16s. per ton of lead. That is to say, assuming silver to
keep up at 2s. 9Jd. per oz., the South Blocks, working on
last month’s scale, would come out clear, showing
neither profit nor loss, if lead fell £5 16s. below £2O 12s.

Block 14 is more calculated to bite the unwary
than any other Broken Hill stock just now. The mine
has admittedly done far beyond expectations. Two
things, working together, are wholly responsible—the
development of scattered bodies of carbonates, and the
phenomenal lead market. Carbonates, which can be
smelted direct, and at this mine are 32 per cent, lead,
command nowadays a high price, because very little of
this class of ore, which “runs like water” in the furnace,
is available. Mainly by rooting out this ore, Block 14
has been making £3OOO a week profit. But this ore is
essentially a surface ore ; there cannot possibly be more
than a few' thousand tons of it. The mine’s future must
rest on its sulphides ; and the sulphide developments
have been wretchedly poor, in spite of a few flashes in the
pan. For the past quarter, the co. will pay £26,500 in
uivs. on Nov. 13 ; that is, 2s. 6d. per share all round,
besides the preference shareholders’ 10 per cent. That
cannot, however, for the reasons stated, be taken as any
sort of a guide to the co.’s future payments.

The little Gillies zinc plant, which has passed
through considerable tribulation at Broken Hill, is again
grinding away with one pan of doubtful identity and
mixed parentage. Its few tons of concentrates a week
a ‘® n °. t of high assay value (it is putting through 500 tons
of tailings), but still they are well above the marketable
grade ; and while this little lot is keeping the pot boiling
at Broken Hill, the directors in Melbourne are having a
tug-of-war with financial difficulties, and are completing
arrangements for the use of a satisfactory flotation
process. The De Bavay plant, which aspires to the pro-
duction of a 49 per cent, zinc concentrate, has a com-
pletely remodelled plant, but is not yet out of the
wood. Regular treatment at the rate of 200 tons of tail-
mgs per day, and the production of a 49 per cent, con-
centrate, is still a dream of the management.
The S. M. Herald published a wire the other
day about the Broken Hill North under the heading
Huge silver-lead lodes : Ore body 700 ft. wide.” Huge
—rather ! Divide it by 10, and the S. M. Herald would
stdl be a bit ahead of anything the B. H. North can show.
The Crowl Creek-Shuttleton (N.S.W.), recon-
structed only a few months ago, has struck trouble at its
banker’s : wherefore it had to rush up a notice at the end
of last week that all hands must go. It might have been
better if the notice had been posted a month earlier, for
wages have fallen heavily into arrear. Though the mines
haven’t lived up to surface prospects (copper shows very
rarely do), it is inconceivable that, with so much de-
velopment work done, the co. will be allowed to fall
through altogether. All that is the matter is that the
recent reconstruction was put through on a wrong basis,
the result, no doubt, of the abnormal metal-market con-
ditions prevailing at the time.

.The Operator, Wyalong (N.S.W.), was the
scene, the other day, of a scramble for possession, the
lease having been cancelledfor non-observance of working
conditions. The object is not purely one of exploring
mother earth, but because of the fact that the Operator,
a lease of five acres, which has been fairly well developed
down to the 250 ft., contains valuable frontages to the
main street of West Wyalong. Hence the successful
applicant will doubtless endeavor to drop his heavy
burden into the lap of the Brookman Go. (late Red Flao-)
which co. in turn will secure the aforesaid valuable
frontages, and eventually dispose of them, by amalga-
mating the two properties, and concentrating the addi-
tional labor required in the Brookman co.’s present
workings. This opens up a prospect not contemplated
when the new Mining Act was being framed. The appli-
cations (26 in all) have been sent on to the Minister.

Although some of the stopes at Mt. David
(N.S.W.) have been worked out, there is nothing for the
market to take such a decided huff over. The shoot of
payable stone seems likely to go down, and is longer at
No. 2 level than at No. 1 ; in fact, the latter will have to
be driven some 70ft. to connect with the “ B ” rise from
No. 2. As to backs, they are, of course, limited ; the
management, in maintaining a heavy output, has hardly
had time to see to reserves.
The New Homeward Bound, Wyalong
(N.S. W.), has achieved its fourth “ threepenny.”
Metallurgist F. Drake, one of the first men to
tackle the concentration of Broken Hill ores, in the
early days of the Barrier field, goes back to Europe this
week with half-a-dozen N. S. Wales copper and silver-lead
options in his portmanteau. For some years after leaving
Australia, Drake represented large Anglo-French interests
in S'Africa, and, in spite of all the absurd yarns about
Socialistic legislation, those interests are inclined to turn
this way in search of investments. So far as the “ Social-
istic legislation ” is concerned, Mr. Drake, after nearly 12
months in Australia, is prepared to report to his people
that they needn’t have any misgivings.
The Australian gold output continues tailing
off ; for the first nine months of the year the aggregate
was estimated at 2,354,1000 z., as against 2,587,8510z] for
the same section of last year. There is a general shrink-
age ; but the Westralian shrinkage is the worst.
* * *
Westralia’s gold output:—
Jan.-Sept., 1905 .. .. 1,469,353 oz.
» 1906 .. .. 1,345,653 „
» 1907 .. .. 1,247,156 „
Yet, owing to closer economies, dividends keep up. The
other way of putting it is that the foreign owners are
drawing as much as they did, but the State which
supplies the gold is getting less and less out of it.
* * *• »
The total Westralian output of gold since 1886
to the end of September is 17,913,3870 z. fine, valued at
£76,090,326. Dividends paid have totalled £17,013,066, of
which £1,275,901 was paid between January and Septem-
ber of this year. The chief contributors to the total
have been Great Boulder, £2,578,675 ; Horseshoe
£2,430,000; Oroya-Brown Hill, £2,011,241; Ivanhoe’
£1,818,750 ; Great Fingall, £1,512,500 ; Boulder Persever-
ance, £1,286,250; Kalgurli, £540,000; Associated Northern,
£525,000; and Sons of Gwalia, £441,925. The October
distribution already reaches £142,500.

Loch Mines Ltd. (W.A.) has gone into liquida-
tion. Thisco. was registered in Sept., 1905, to acquire
all the assets of a moribund concern which owned a
played-out mine, known as the Lady Loch, at Coolgardie.
Some £13,500 was subscribed, half of which was paid away
as consideration-money. The balance was melted in the
usual way. Finally, the co. reached the end of its tether,
and then the auctioneer came along and disposed of
everything in sight. The chairman explained, at the
recent meeting of shareholders, that their remaining
asset was stock held in the Jacoletti mine, Southern
Cross, and the Board thought it better to wind up the
co. and distribute these shares among shareholders. As
the Jacoletti is also a wild-cat, the outlook for share-
holders seems as black as ever.
* * * *
The Great Tower Hill Cos. (W. A.) is still looking
for fresh capital. In the meantime, local creditors are
being buoyed up with the managerial assurance that
every effort is being made to raise the wind, and that
everything will come out right in the end. Some of the
claimants, however, are getting very impatient.
* * * *
Explorer Frank Hann has again turned up in
the West, this time with an account of his latest journey
across the Never-Never from S. Australia. As on former
occasions, the ancient battler tells about crossing sand-
hills, meeting the tracks of others in perishable parts,
narrow squeaks from death through thirst, and poisoned
camels. He also volunteers the information that he saw
no mineral country on or near the border.

Norval and party’s recent rich find in Bayley’s
Mine, Coolgardie (W.A.), seems to have been a very lucky
one. Other tributing parties had previously worked the
ground and just missed the patch by a hair’s breadth or
thereabouts. Estimated that £9OOO worth of 9oz. ore has
since been taken out by Norval and his mates.
* * « *
Nearly 2000 tons have been picked out of the
Karridale, at Burtville (W.A.), during the past four years,
and treated for an average of soz. per ton ; and ore of
even better grade is said to be on hand for crushing.
Judging by the time taken to get out the stone already
crushed, the shoot cannot be very big or regular ; but the
shoot doesn’t need to be very big or regular to give a
small party fine profits when the stuff averages £2O per
ton.
The Maori Queen lease, Yundamindera (W.A.),
has been sold to a Melbourne syndicate for a few thousand
pounds. Since this show was discovered, six years ago,
it has produced 24000 z. of gold over the plates, with an
average of about 9dwt. left in the tailings. It is esti-
mated that there is now nearly £20,000 worth of gold in
sight; but this remains to be proved.
* * » *
lhe old British King, at Darlot (W.A.), is again
earning money. This show was once owned by the Fingall
Keefs Extended Cos., of London, but was thrown up after
about 10,000 oz. of gold had been extracted from above
trie 160 ft. level. J. Bull seems to have cleared out in a
hurry, as he left a heap of sands behind which someone
else subsequently treated for a profit of about £2500.
The present owners are said to be doing well, but what
is a fortune to a small party of working miners is utter
poverty to an over-capitalised English company.
* » • *
Ziegler’s old claim at Bung-Eye Gully, Norse-
man (W.A.), is again being worked with profitable
results. This show was first tested about eight years
ago by Ziegler, who took between 300 and 400 oz. of gold
out of it, and then left. Another man came along a few
years later, unearthed more gold, and also departed.
Now a third man and his mates have dollied over £4OO
worth of gold. They are still there.
* * * *
The Emu Bay Railway 00. (the railway is in
Tas. and the shares are held in Melbourne and elsewhere)
is offering something novel in the way of reconstruction.
Besides a goodwill item—“ Rights acquired under the
oi„ °" ? Railway Act and other concessions,
£IOO,OOO —the co. had at Dec. 31 last two paper assets •
Preliminary exes., £36,125; and profit and loss deficit,
£30,552. The co. now proposes to wipe out the bulk of
these two latter items by writing off ss. per share
from the 260,000 ordinary shares, which will provide
£65,000. The other £IOO,OOO of paper won’t be disturbed.
The most rational way to knock that lot off its
perch would be to wipe out the 100,000 ordinary shares
which were issued against those rights. But though those
rights really were not worth 100,000 pence, no doubt
many of the shares have left the hands of the original
holders, so, for that reason among others, it isn’t feasible
to wipe them out. The public subscribed for 160,000
ordinary and 100,000 pref. shares. The present proposal
i® ' vipe ,. ss - off the vendor’s 100,000 and the public’s
160,000 ordinaries ; but “ notwithstanding the reduction,
the ordinary shares are to rank as regards dividend and
capital as at present.” In other words, though they will
look like 15s. shares in the balance-sheet, they will really
be 20s. shares so far as distributions of profit and capital
are concerned, and the difference between that and fakirv
a balance-sheet is too small to be worth troubling about
It is really a plan for getting rid of two awkward-looking
paper assets by nominally writing off capital which
actually isn’t written off. Why the directors when they
are about it don’t go the whole hog and write off the
whole £165,000 isn t clear. Since the writing off means
nothing whatever, it would be just as easy to write off
15s. as 55.; wherefore the moderation of the co. is, under
the circumstances, quite unintelligible and also quite
superfluous.
The position of the co. as at Dec. 31,1906, when
the last accounts were made up, was that, for the second
time in its history of nine years, a profit was shown after
paying interest on the £200,000 of debentures. The co.’s
freight is almost wholly in minerals, and the metal boom
was responsible for the good figures. Besides the deben-
tures just mentioned, the co. has £IOO,OOO of 8 per cent
preference capital, and a 4 per cent, dividend on this is
cumulative ; the accumulations on this account to Dec.
31 last were £27,207. Further, there is a standing charge
of £10,370 a year for the use of a section of the line owned
by the Emu Bay and Mt. Bisehoff Railway 00. ; and this
is a shocking drag during the lean years that come to
every mining field. Under the circumstances, the clean-
ing up, even if it were the leal thing, would be far from
being as thorough as the circumstances call for.
* * * *
Gladstone (Tas.) was the pioneer in the tin-
dredging boom, and it is fittingly the pioneer in reaching
the div. stage. All it pays is a modest 25., but that’s a
beginning. The market didn’t even blink at the news,
for it is ready to accept anything now in the tin line since
the blow-out of the Brothers No. 1, and the 18-ton yield
of the Briseis Extended.
* * * #
Jumbunna Coal (Vic.) directors tell the share-
holders as follows This falling off in output (3022
tons) is notin any way due to a lessened capacity of the
mine, but solely to want of miners. Many of our best
men left the district owing to the action of‘some of their
fellow workmen, who are attempting to form and
register anew union under the Commonwealth Arbitra-
tion Act. The same reason kept new men from coming,
who would otherwise have taken their places. We are
opposing this registration, as are also the majority of our
miners, being quite sure that it is against the best
interests of the co. and the men.” That is to say, a
union which is being formed to raise wages and secure
better conditions for the worker is likely to do him harm !
This comes from a State-subsidised co., which alleges
that 13s. per ton for its coal is not a paying price. Its
accounts show that mine wages, “ material, plant, etc ”
amounted to £19,933 during the past half-year. Capital
expenditure, therefore, seems to have been lumped with
ordinary working expenses, which is a strange way of
doing things. No doubt it is done that way for a purpose.
Of course, the } T arn about tbe scarcity of miners is fudge.
That scarcity has nothing to do with'the local growth of
unionism—especially the brand of unionism that looks
to arbitration. It is because good miners are in demand
at Newcastle, Broken Hill, and elsewhere. They won’t
stop in a district where they are not to be allowed to take
steps to protect themselves, and where their billets
depend on their employers continuing to receive uncertain
State aid.

Bendigo shows up poorly for the nine months.
The total (141,6990 z.) is the lowest since 1902 ; the highest
was in 1904, when 185,2600 z. was reached between January
1 and Sept. 30. Every month’s output this year has been
below that for the corresponding month of last .year.
Cause, the failure of the field to replace such gold-pro-
ducers as South New Moon, Specimen Hill, and New
Argus. The best mine for the moment is probably Vir-
ginia, but its dividends go into only half a dozen pockets.
* * * ■*
Great Northern Extended Consols, Rutherglen
(Vic.), has a big name and small yields. It lives just
about as long as the Prentice and Southern, lower down
the lead, pumps for it: the co. has not at present the
strength of capital to keep the mine dry on its own.
Shareholders have put up £71,500, and gold has provided
£BI,OOO additional; so the mine hasn’t been treated badly.
If, however, the co. had another £IO,OOO cash in hand to
get on with drives, and to let the ground drain longer,
things would be very different; it might then get in the
dividend list with anything like the last half-year’s average.
Water and the need to get gold hamper operations,
though the Board runs the show so that every penny is
made to buy a full penn’orth. Hartley, the chairman, is
the biggest supporter of Rutherglen'mining just now,
and he looks for better times. But he must not discount
the fact that funds are short lower down the lead.

The Argus nags about the poor yields from
two Daylesford shows—Nuggety Ajax and Sailors Falls.
Now, the Argus gave the Ajax boom a lift at the start,
and never said a word of warning till the boom fizzled.
Having been silent so long, it might have waited a
bit longer ; for, after all, it is early to say that the
Nuggety Ajax and the Sailors Falls are duffers, though
unfortunately the dreary Waste of Daylesford mining,
even with the Ajax thrown in, doesn’t give much hope of
better things. The whole question is, Why was a battery
put up to crush stone till some bulk work had been done'?
There is plenty of crushing power within reach, and a
battery test is worth yards of assay sampling. It is just
here that Ballarat messes up things. A prospect, then a
battery; after that, open up the mine. Things should
be the other way round. If the Argus wants to preach a
sermon, here is a text.

Peak Downs, the Central‘Queensland copper
bubble, is to have a meeting this week in Brisbane,
whereat the mysterious arrangement with the Mt.
Morgan crowd is to be unfolded. It is certain that when
the details are made public those unfortunate dupes who
have swallowed the Stock Exchange yarns, concerning
what Mt. Morgan is going to do for present shareholders,
will want to kick somebody. Whether the Mt. Morgan
crowd takes an option over Peak Downs or not, recon-
struction must certainly take place almost immediately
and development of the property will have to be carried
on for quite six months before anyone can decide whether
the property is worth hanging on to with copper at an
average price.
Mfc. Molloy (N.Q.) has suspended dividends for
clt'i lla (: year i y accounts to June 30 only now issued
Conner hnrf adlnß: ’ have changed since then.
Copper had averaged over £IOO up to that date, and the
° re , w .\ s nclle . r than it is now, and the output was
CwL h and the .optimistic punter was still nrevalent.
Costs have certainly been reduced these last few months ;
hut more definite information on the point will be needed
to stop the tendency to unload. Late returns, though
depressing, are not so bad as they seem at first sight.
More low-grade fluxing ore is now included, so the
average value of the ore and the costs have come down
together. If 500 tons of 5 per cent, silicious ore is fluxed
with 500 tons of 2 per cent, pyritic ore, instead of with
barren material, the average yield is reduced, but the
profit is increased. That is why Mt. Lyell, with a return
of 2 per cent, or thereabouts, does better than many 4
per cent, copper mines that have to drag' lime and iron-
stone long distances. Rapid progress will be made with
Molloy s connecting railway ; 1700 tons of rails have been
delivered.
* * * *
The Hampden-Cloncurry and Mt. Elliott people
have concluded some sort of an arrangement with the
Queensland Government regarding the railway to connect
those mines with the State line. Mt. Elliott is to put
up £60,000, Hampden £40,000, and the Government
£100,000; and the Government is to get 3| per cent,
out of the profits. So far no other particulars of con-
sequence are forthcoming ; and a few are needed.
What arrangement is there for the return of capital?
A railway built to take away the output of a mine must
sooner or later find itself terminating at a mere hole in
the ground ; and when the mine becomes a mere hole in
the ground, the railway' becomes a mere quantity of use-
less rusting steel and decaying timber. The peopie who
own the mine that is to become a mere hole in the
ground have hitherto mostly' made an agreement
with the State that just about the time when that
happens the State may or shall become the owner
of the railway. Apparently nothing of that sort is pro-
vided for here ; but it would be interesting' to know
whether Kidston has upended the usual arrangements,
and provided that the State shall be relieved of its Share
in the business by the time the business is likely to be
unprofitable. And for that purpose nothing less than a
5 per cent, sinking fund is called for.
* * VC *
Mt. Hector (O.) was stated, three or four weeks
ago, to have an overdraft of £4778, secured by uncalled
capital amounting to £4947. Shareholders met again in
Brisbane a few days ago and found that the debt was
growing, and there was trouble about meeting current
accounts. The bank, however, undertook to see the co.
out of that trouble, on certain guarantees being pro-
vided. So far the total liabilities exceed the uncalled
capital by' about £IOOO. Some shareholders hang on to
the hope that £2OOO worth of matte in transit will help
them through ; but the chances are that that matte has
been drawn against for its full value, if not more. So the
outlook is dismal.
* * * *
Mungana (N.Q.) has had a good output of
copper, lead, and silver lately, and the'Girofla shaft has
struck a patch of 30 per cent, lead ore a few feet below
the 410 ft. level. Metallurgist Kunze is trying to place
the treatment of Mungana’s complex sulphides on a satis-
factory basis before he leaves. The difficulties have been
under-rated. The ore is complex, because it is a mixture
of copper, lead and zinc combined with sulphur. Roast-
ing in Edwards’ furnace after the ore is crushed to a
powder, and converting in Huntingdon pots, may' make
the ore smelt better ; but how about the cost? There is
no parallel between the treatment of Broken Hill Prop.’s
rich concentrates in Huntingdon-Heberlein converters,
and that of Mungana’s 12 per cent, lead ore mixed with
copper and zinc.
* • * *
The fearfully and wonderfully managed J. Bull
co. that owns the Great Australian, Cloncurry, knocked
off most of its mine hands, the other day, and the chances
are that the rest will follow. Naturally, the first big
Cloncurry co. to funk on the copper slump is the one
that boasted most of what it was going to do. Still, if
the closing-down is only' temporary and results in a com-
plete change of methods, it will be a good thing for the
co. and the field. It would take a Mt. Morgan to stand
the methods that have prevailed hitherto.
* * * «
It is officially admitted now that the McGregor
leases (of the McGregor Cloncurry Cos.) have given “ in-
different ” results ; but the Wallaroo leases are represented
as being plums. The No. I shaft cut the lode at 84ft.
(water level), and it is announced that a crosscut proves
the lode there to be 28ft. wide. But what are the indica-
tions that it is anything more than a bulge ? The footwall
and hanging walls are heading in different directions, and
that is suspicious. An official report says that drives
have been put in north and south 50ft. on the foot-
wall, and the faces are still in ore. It might
have told shareholders what the ore is worth. South,
at any rate, the face on a recent date showed good
“ buck ” quartz. The north drive has exposed ore here
and there. Same with the drive north on the hanging
wall : jt has yielded ore, but the stuff broken has to be
picked, and picked again. Probably this much-picked
ore will be sent to Mt. Elliott smelters, or further afield ;
but the man who accepts the return as showing what the
28ft. lode is made of is liable to hurt himself.
There is a change for the better in the bottom
of the Vulcan (N.Q.), which is really about the first cheer-
ful thing 1 that has happened since the shares were cut up,
and the guileless working-men of Irvinebank let the
southerner in at high prices. Almost as cheerful is the
news that, in view of the changed outlook, the local
powers are more disposed to put in an aerial tramway, or
something of the sort, to get the stone to the battery.
But nobody dares to yet suggest that the mine should do
its own crushing.
The little Charters Towers co.—the Marble
Island Iron and Limestone Cos. —that owns the speck in
the ocean from which Mt. Morgan is drawing its iron flux
supplies, expects to make up its dividends to £4 per share
for this half-year, and to keep it at that while the
contract lasts. The big; co. is to take 100,000 tons at
Is. 6d. per ton, mining the stuff itself, and
improvements (wharves, etc.) are to go to the co.
that owns the island. The latest calculations set “ the
quantity of ore on the surface” at 3,000,000 tons;
and the last fair sample showed 62 per cent,
metallic iron—about the grade up to which iron-
ore is now being actually concentrated by magnetic
process in Sweden for English iron-masters. With iron-
ore of this quality on the Queensland coast, it will be
something to gamble about presently as to whether the
Mt. Morgan Cos. or the Broken Hill Proprietary (which
has a fine deposit at Iron Knob, whence it gets its flux
supplies) will establish an iron and steel making depart-
ment first. It is pretty certain that the idea is buzzing
in theß.H. Prop’s head, and that gen. manager Delprat
(who gets back to Australia this week) made special
inquiries into the matter in Europe.

Tin, which opened this year at £195, got down
to £l4l 10s. for spot before the end of last week ; and
the situation at Tingha (N.S.W.) and other old fields is
precarious. There is no metal more unreliable ; the
average price for 1897—10 years ago—was no higher than
£6l Bs., and it had been lower than that. Absolutely
blind as to the future, yet remembering the tricks the
market has played hitherto, the N.S.W. dredges are
cutting down expenses, and have mostly knocked off their
timber-getters wherever they have got two or three
months’ supply of firewood on hand. They are not pre-
pared to risk what may happen beyond that time.

“Caradoc” : The stoppage of work by the Tas-
manian Copper Cos. at Leigh’s Creek gives a serious bump
to S.A.’s far north copper mining, but it was a bubble
that was certain to be pricked pretty soon whether
copper kept over or under £7O. The fall in the metal
market was an excuse rather than a cause for the shutting,
down, as was patent to everybody who had watched the
events of the past four months and who knew the country’s
squibby nature. The whole of the north to Warrinais
ht only for scattered parties of gougers, and it is absurd
to suppose any big co. is going to make a“do ”of it. If
nalf-a-dozen of the squibs and gash veins were crowded
into an 80-acre section, there would then be some reason
tor erecting machinery and smelters on the spot; but the
cupriferous blobs occur erratically over an area of country
as big as a small State, and are not high-grade at that.
certainly in bygone years the-Blinman turned out a bit
of copper, as also did the Mount Rose ; but neither of
them is now wortlvls. an acre. All attempts to geton toa
continuation of shoots worked in earlier years have failed
—tailed because their shoots were of the squib variety.
Their squibs happened to be rather larger squibs than most
others, but still they were just squibs. To make things
pay, ore must be plentiful, worth at least 7 per cent.,
and metal not below £BO per ton.

The introduction into .the Broken Hill and
Western Australian Mines of a small hand rock-drill for
boring “ pops ” to break up large blocks of ore, cutting
“hitches ” for timber, and squaring up shafts and levels,
has quite revolutionised the old method of working with
hammers and gad. The best machine for this work is the
“ Shaw ” Hand Rock Drill and is manufactured by the
Austral Otis Engineering Company, Ltd., Melbourne,
who are the sole agents. The machine weighs only 161bs.
and has only one working part—the hammer—which
serves the purpose also of a valve. One man with this
machine can easily do as much work as four men with
hammer and drill. Ir some of the hardest lodes in the
Boulder these machines bore over lin. a minute, and in
softer country as much as 24in. per minute. Unlike other
types, the operator does not experience any excessive
vibration due to the recoil of the hammer. The working
pressure is 801bs. per square inch and the machine uses
about 25 cubic feet of free air per minute. Ten of the
biggest mines in West Australia are now using the Shaw
Hand Rock drills. Fullest particulars may be obtained
from the Company’s offices in South Melbourne, where
the machine may be seen working.* [c]

Ceremony by the Mayor.—Speaking at the opening
ceremony in connection with the recently completed ex-
tensive water supply contract, the Mayor of Auckland,
Mr. A. M. Myers, said : —“ It was only right to state
The Mephan Ferguson Steel Pipe Co. should have credit
for the splendid way in which they had carried out their
contract for the supply of steel mains. The Council much
appreciated what the Company had done. Although the
cost involved some £63,000, still was not £10 of

Business Education.—A tree is known by its
fruit, a business school by its successes in public exami-
nations and the demand of business men for its gradu-
ates. In both these respects Stott and Hoare’s Business
College stands at the head. A single instance will ex-
emplify the first claim : At all Government Examina-
tions for Shorthand Writers and Typists, held during the
past five years, students have won first place. As to the
second, not only does every student as soon as competent
secure an appointment, but the demand for graduates
greatly exceeds the supply. It is a mistake in these
times to put a boy to business immediately he has passed
through his primary or high-school course ; years of
poorly-paid drudgery will be saved him, and his pros-
pects of advancement will be greatly enhanced by giving
him a sound modern business education at this well-
known institution. Prospectus post free. 28 Moore

“ The Prooshan ” : “ Midnight ” came in
from Chocklogatoo out-station, and with him came
his famous kangaroo dog Bosco. Meeting the boss
’rooing some five miles from the homestead. Mid-
night was invited to join the hunt. Now, the boss’s
dogs were good, especially a blue slut with a bob-
tail, and he chaffed the black good-humoredly as
they rode in quest of their quarry. “ Bobtail
beat Bosco bad, Midnight.” “No pfear, boss,
you wait see, Bothco best slut in dis country.”
By-p,nd-bye ,a big red’roo was sighted, and the
three dogs were off like the wind, followed by the
party, led by Midnight in full cry. At first the
blackfellow’s dog led easily. And his owner was
nearly frantic. “Good old Bothco. Can’t lick
old Bothco. Go it Bothco, yeheo oo ! ”
-Presently the ’roo tacked, and the bobtail got the
inside running, and eventually killed. As the
party rode home Midnight was gloomy and
thoughtful, but silent as the grave. The moment
they reached the homestead he dragged his slut up
to the woodheap, got her tail on a log, and
chopped it off with an axe. The slut made a
plunge, and, in a moment, was off up the dusty
road like lightning. Midnight looked after her
like a man watching the flight of a meteor.
'■Then, turning, he remarked regretfully to himself,
” Cutem too damn short.”
AFTER THE FROST.
SNYTHEE: “Great Scott, is that you, Egbert?
And you've come down to this!"
EGBERT ANSTRUTHER (ex-tragedian): “Come
down, sir; yes, but, by gad, I'm still a
leading man !”
“ Gip ” : Should we eat pig, and is there
anything a pig ivont eat ? Once on the bank of a
creek I ran on to a big black snake so extremely
dead as to have become a blot on the landscape.
Rather a tame-looking pig followed me closely.
Even a dead snake has a certain fascination, and
after covering most of my face with my hanky, I
turned the reptile’s head over with a long stick.
The pig came up, grunting friendlily, and to my
horror proceeded hastily to swallow that yard or
two of deadiiness. She ate it all, every scrap, and
sniffed round for more. And (ye gods 1) she was
a “ baconer.” I have never eaten bacon since.
“ J.G.” : Jim Morrissey and his reptiles
remind me of another snake fool who used to
prowl round northern Victoria, picking up
lively tiger, brown, black, and other venom-
ous types. Having collected about 80, he
placed them in an old bran bag, hoisted the bag
on his shoulder, and marched away to Kerang.
There he trained for Bendigo, and stowed the bag
of snakes under the seat. At Bendigo lie dumped
his bagof reptiles downamong the other passengers’
luggage, and went off to have a drink. Presently
the all-seeing porter came along, and noticing the
wriggles of the bag, thought he had a case for col-
lecting excess luggage. He was opening the port-
manteau, and as he did so the voice of the snake-
charmer fell on his ear : “Look out, young feller,
them’s my snakes.” The porter looked out, and
also lighted out for the other end of the platform.
Then he regarded the snake man, a weird-
looking individual with one wooden leg, a
clean-shaven face, and long, matted hair, and
ordered him to get off the premises,
snakes and all, and also informed him that he
would not be allowed to take his reptiles on the
railway again unless they were properly boxed up.
The professor took his snakes away and opened a
show, where he explained that he had an antidote
for snake poison. He used to allow the snakes to
bite him and then apply his cure ; and, to prove
that the snakes were genuinely poisonous, he
requested the people to bring along mongrel dogs
and unnecessary cats. They came in crowds, and
the snakes had a good time. The reason the pro-
fessor had a wooden leg was that his real one had
been chopped off to save his life once when the
antidote didn’t get to work with sufficient velocity.
It was reported that, after he left Bendigo, he
lost an arm for the same reason. As he has
not been around since, it is presumed that his
head and body have also had to be amputated to
save his life.

There was a curious mixture of our Sove-
reign Lord Edward and our Tickapenny Brother
Bill up at far-north Cooktown lately. Over
against Cooktown there is a large collection of
brother Bill and sister Mary, and they happen to
be a mixed lot, tribal laws being suspended for
cadging purposes. But the ancient customs
haven’t been blotted out altogether, wherefore
when Tiger was accused of spearing Missador, of
the Mclvor tribe, Tiger had to undergo the trial
by combat. Armed only with a woomera, he
had to stand off ahead of his own tribe and face
30 Mclvor spears. He parried the first volley ;
but one of a second volley beat him and caught
him in the hand. While Tiger was thinking over
the matter, Jacky, reckoning tribal proceedings
too slow, crept up and fatally speared Tiger in
the back. Then King Edward became interested
in the proceedings of King Billy, and Jacky
found himself charged with murder. A Cook-
town jury puzzled over the matter for a day, then
decided that Black Brother had best settle the
whole argument himself, wherefore Jacky was
turned adrift. And seeing that, after he had
thrown the spear in the unauthorised fashion,
Tiger’s tribesmen grabbed their spears and pursued
Jacky into the mangroves, it looks as though there
will be another dead nigger up there shortly—if
he isn’t dead already. On the whole, this paper
has an idea that black brother Jacky hasn’t had
quite a fair deal; it was a fair enough thing for
him to stand one trial, but to make him stand two
—King Edward’s and King Billy’s—is a bit too
much like asking him to lay two to one where
other men get an even chance.

“G-.S.K.”: Within the south-western
region of Queensland there exist certain geological
mysteries called mud springs. Each of these con-
sists of a conical mound from 12ft. to 14ft. high
and from 14ft. to 16ft. through the base, whilst
the width across the top varies from 8ft. to 10ft.
The slope of the mound is grassy, and the topis
soft and muddy. Sheep often get bogged on the
top of a spring, and die there ; the remains of the
greater animals are also found in the slush. On
rare occasions the springs break forth into running
streams, and the bones of the perished animals,
together with large stones and sundries, are
carried over the sides, so that there is a collection
of debris at the base of each cone. Probably they
are outlets of the artesian water channels, and
break forth when the channels become over-
charged. Presumably they were once level with
the surrounding country, but the constant percola-
tion of muddy water through the ground built the
cones.

Diarrhoea, in its first stages, can be cured
by a few doses of that pleasant, reliable, and
effectual medicine, Chamberlain’s Colic, Cholera,
and Diarrhoea Remedy. In many instances one
dose is sufficient, but as a rule three or four
doses are necessary. It is a good thing to keep
it in the house. Get a bottle to-day; it may save
a life.*
A BARGAIN.
MRS. NEWGHUM (inspecting a recently-purchased home in Gippstand): All those black,
charred stumps and logs make the place look SO dismal.”
MR. NEWCHUM : “ They're all wight. This Government weport says: 'An abundance of black-
wood is a weliable indication of Superior soil."
“10x2x4” (Sydney) is stirred to re-
miniscence by pars dealing with out-backers’
kindly treatment of strangers :
Was taken, one summer, by a fellow-toiler in this city
to stay with an up-country family, and shoot rabbits, lie,
fish, pet thrown off horses, and otherwise enjoy existence
as undergone in the utternrost recesses of Beyond. We
struck Awfulparirika—the place where the railway ended,
and the 50-mile coach and 15-mile waggonette drive, that
lay between us and our destination, began—at the hour
of 2 a.m.
My friend said, “ Come over to the Royal, and have a
drink with dear old Michael Hogan before the coach
starts. We have half-an-hour to wait, and Mick’s feel.ngs
’d be hurt if he heard I went through without calling on
him.” Agreed. A pallid barman let us in at a side r door
and brought whiskv, but refused affrightedly to disturb
Hogan, who, he said, had gone to bed, fighting drunk,
some hours earlier.
As we were having one more apiece, there came a rat-
tling sound from without like unto a bolting bottle-o-cart.
I queried whether it mightn’t be the coach. My friend
scouted the idea. “ You don’t seem,” he said, “to have
grasped the fact that I’m well known and liked about
here. I come every summer. Alfred, the coach-driver,
would as soon think of leaving me behind as he would
Rawson ; he’s seen my baggage, and that’s enough.” Our
drinks finished, we emerged upon the roadway.
“ Didn’t you two young fellers want the coach fer
Depression'Flat ? ” asked a railway employee. We ad-
mitted the fact as one man. “Well, yer missed ’er.
Alf ’lggins left quarter of an hour ago.”
Forcing an air of calmness, I asked when the next
coach left. “ We’n’sday,” the man rejoined. “ Twice a
week she goes ”—— At this my friend broke in : “ The
whole thing’s a mistake,” he explained. “ Higgins thinks
I’m inside. As soon as he finds his foolish error, he’ll
wait. What we’ve got to do now is to walk briskly after
him.”
I thought anything was better than staying three days
in that sort of place, and so—albeit apprehensively-
started out. We made good going for the first four miles,
as day hadn’t yet broken and it was fairly cool. Presently
the sun rose. Before us we saw a long, undulating,
magenta-colored road, but no Alf.
“ Simply inexplicable,” said my friend. “If you could
manage a gentle trot down the hills it might be a good
plan. He hadn’t much of a start, and I know he stops
for mails at a station a couple of miles from here.” We
ran swiftly down three hills. As we toiled perspiringly
to the summit of a fourth a sickening feeling of hopeless-
ness obsessed me. From this hill there was a fine view
of the surrounding country. Away below us, as far as
the eye could reach, stretched the road, innocent alike of
Alf or any vehicle.
“ My God ! ” said my friend ; “ we’ve taken the wrong
turning.” A big hpmestead—square, white and. cool in
its setting of willows and garden plots—shimmered in the
middle distance. “ That place,” he went on, mopping his
brow “belongs to the Smith-Smythes. I don’t exactly know
them, but I know relatives of theirs, and they know the
people we’re going to. Obviously there’s only one thing to
do, and that is go boldly in, explain the position, and ask
for the loan of a horse and trap.”
Under other circumstances, I might have hesitated, but
this case was desperate. The Smythe manage was abed
when we arrived, so we sat on a garden seat and waited. *
I regarded my friend, and then myself, and brooded as
to the chances of our being taken for horse thieves. I
dismissed the horse-thief theory (neither of us looked
horsey enough) ; and also, subsequently, the idea that
we could be tak n for any other sort of malefactors since
we both looked too foolish. I decided the average
observer would judge us to be lunatics.
We heard a blind snap-up, and a woman’s head ap-
peared at an open window, surmounting an ornate sac de
nuit. My friend rose, removed his hat with a certain
grace, and bowed, whereat there was a faint squeak, and
the window closed. “ Damn her,” he said irritably, and
sat down again.
Life began to stir about the place, and presently the
gravel crunched, and a middle-aged man of squire-like
aspect approached. It spoke powerfully for his courtesy
that he bore with us. My friend rendered our weird
story. Then he gave his name, which the squire had
never heard ; spoke of the people we were going to visit
(whom, it transpired; the squire didn’t know); and wound
up with a demand (1) for breakfast and (2) for a horse and
sulky, the same to be returned “ within the month.”
In dazed fashion I found myself at breakfast listening
to my friend putting in further good work on our behalf.
“ I may tell you, Mrs. Sniythe,” he said, affably, “ that I
know your aunt, Mrs. Browne, who lives at Manly”——-
“ I haven’t any aunt of that name, nor any relative living
in Manly,” she said. My friend became argumentative ",
the Smythe lady remained firm. As things bade fair to
get unpleasant I hastened outside.
The whole family, together with their retainers, saw us
off ; the oldsters funereally grave, the younger members
in a condition bordering on hysteria. “ Can either of you
drive?” asked Smith-Smythe hopelessly. “Hand me
the ribbons,” said my friend cheerfully. “ I was born in
the saddle-bow.” What he meant God knows, but
Smythe’s dejection deepened. As my friend was no
driver at all, and the old mare we sat behind was “light
in the mouth ” and tricky, our going aroused general in-
terest. We yawned drunkenly away, followed by 14 dogs
and most of the station hands, hit the gate-post smartly,
cannoned into the road, and lit out for the distant
horizon. I have never seen any of the Sm.vthes since.
As it chanced, they got their turnout back three weeks
later in a practically undamaged state.
Is there any other country on earth where two total and
suspicious-looking strangers could am, in the above
fashion and not get run in for trying to obtain horse-
flesh and carriage-ware under false pretences ? I doubt it.

“ The Prooshan ” : The most difficult man
to find in this country is the miner who is actually
on payable gold. Whenever you strike him it’s a
matter of only a week or two till he hopes to get
on the gutter, but if you go at the appointed time
the rock has risen, a bar has come in, she’s dipped
off, or something has happened ; but as soon as he
gets through that bar, he is confident he’ll touch
good gold ; and, indeed, he stoops down and picks
up a stone and jerks it over on to the very place
the real good gold is to lurk under. He is the
most sanguine of men, and even after 15 months
of futile effort and much starve, he seems to be
able to console himself fully by saying, “It ought
to have paid well enough.” He can show you
exactly where Billy Sluicebox made the mista’
and lie could have told Sammy Ealsebottom
“ there was no gold near the Falls,” and how Old
Ripple was mad to spend the time and money he
did on the Point; but as for himself, and his own
race-cutting and dam-making and wasted enter-
prise, well, he only knows “ there oughter bin
gold there.” One of the first things he does, as a
rule, is to dash off into another enterprise of great
importance, entailing more race-cutting, dam-
making, etc., and when six months more have
been spent in preparation he begins to prospect
the ground, just as a mere formality it would
seem.
THE RIVERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Australia is threatened with another drought. —Daily
Paper.
• All the rivers run into the sea.— Ecclesiastes.
The rivers run down to the sea all day,
And pause,not through the nights,
But bear to the salty brine the wealth
A careless nation slights.
And shadowy bales of fleecy wealth
Pass down when daylight fades.
A rustling crop of golden corn
Went out with the evening shades.
The rivers murmured against the banks,
And phantom pirates mocked.
For the rivers run down to the sea all day,
And never a stream is locked.
The shimmering heat on sunbaked plains
Will whiten the dying grass,
And blast with pitiless blaze the grain,
While rivers ceaseless pass.
The risers run down to the sea all day,
While gaunt, starved cattle die.
Was ever a curse so cursed as this
’Neath the dome of the sun-tracked sky ?
The rivers run down to the sea all day.
Will ever the people heed
And build a rampart against the waste
For the time of the country’s need?
The rivers rdn down to the sea all day,
And man, who should have worked,
Will pray in days of stricken need
To save where he has shirked.
The rivers run do\vn to the sea all day
With wealth that might have blest.
And they will—-till men arise and learn
This truth : ’Tis work prays best.

“Gip”: The jackass is a vindictive bird
at least, one of him is. Struck him fighting a
duel t’other morning. The scrap was an arranged
thing, and widely advertised, for the gum-trees
around swarmed with onlookers, and the bush
rang with heartless laughter. The knock-out peck
and scratch brought one of the combatants from a
high branch to the ground, almost at my feet.
His assailant, disregarding my indignant presence,
came at him savagely. By good luck I managed
to hit the attacking bird with a large stick. He
retired long enough to allow me to cover the
beaten one with a handy and holey bucket. A
sudden thought that the coined beef would be
boiled to rags and the dumplings to squash called
me home. I pushed a sardine tin of water under
the protecting bucket, and left. Returning in the
afternoon to liberate Jack, found the attacking
one still attacking. He had pecked a hole in the
ancient bucket almost large enough to admit him
to the presence of his injured relative. Again I
used the large stick with effect (my luck was in),
and, lifting the damaged bird, took him home for
treatment. He died on the way, however.

DISGUSTS PARENT : “ Oh, I'm blessed if I know!

“ Aural ” : In reply to “ Snell’s ” question
(B. 3/10/’O7), I beg to state that you can identify a
bushie in town by pretending to be hard up and
asking him for half-a-crown. He will give it to
you if you really appear hard up. The townie
would see you in Hades first. The bushie’s sim-
plicity is flavored with the milk of human kind-
ness. The townie’s smartness is adulterated with
vinegar and gall.
A WEARY SUBJECT .

“The Batcher”: Be “Larrikin” (B.
3/10/’O7) concerning the Australian bush-girl.
“Larrikin’s” brand is about the worst brand I
have heard of yet. Droughty conditions may be
responsible for the “man’s hat,” the “curtailed
skirt,” “the hob-nailed men’s boots,” which
belong, presumably, to some other members of
the family; but let “Larrikin” give the bush
parents credit for a little decent up-bringing
of their girls. The average bush-girl’s ancestors
take good care that their daughter does not
“shout like a man,” “swear like a trooper,”
“ ride astride,” “ kill a sheep and butcher it well,”
etc. Am glad to say that my experience of the
bush-girl does not coincide with “ Larrikin’s.”
“ The Prooshan ” : We had a real cunnin’
ole dart of a ’orse, called “ Buck,” once ; get inter
ennythin’, eat enny bloomin’ thin’, ’n’ jump enny
bloomin’ thin’. We uster side-line
’n’ ’obble ’irn—no bloomin’ use;
Buck’d jes’get out like a kintorshin
bloke at the serkis, that rolls roun’
th’ other side of ’imself, and looks
down ’is throat into ’is innards. If
’e couldn’ git clear, ’e’d bloomin’
well roll over the fence or bunt it
down. It licked orl. One Satdy
night, me sister Sarah and me was
ridin’ ’ome from the play over at
the township, and there wuz me
noble Buck farst asleep in the road
near the ’ouse. I nearly rid over
’im. “’Old this ’orse,” I sez to
Sarah, as I nips off like a bloomin’
snowflake. Then I gits a thun-
derin’ great bunch er stingin’
nettles close by, and claps ’em
under Buck’s tail close up. Well,
of orl the leps y’ ever see, that ’orse
beat orl. Tork about larf—l nearly
dide. There he wuz, goin’ like
’ell behind and proppin’ dead in
front. It licked oi l. Then he bolts
back’ards, and nigh rams a panel
outer the flower-garden fence;
roun’ the kitchen like mad he goes,
upsettin’ the tubs ’n’ corfin’ ’n’
sneezin’ like mad, ’n’ me bustin’
meself larfin’, and Sarah chasin’
Buck, tryin’ to pull out the nose-
gay, but Buck helt it down like
grim death. And mother comes
runnin’ out in her nightshirt, ’n’
father pokes his head outer the
winder and asts “ Wother ’ell’s
up?” I jes’ rolls on the sofa,
clean done, an’ me mother busts
out myin’, an’ sez she never thort
she’d ever see one of HER boys
come’ome drunk. Next day I
sees Buck at the back er the
paddick ; but he puts his ears
down when he sees me and bolts.
But I sees the nettles wuz gone. It licked orl.

“Elmore”: Someone asks what spirit
moved the individuals who named some places in
Australia ? After a long and searching investiga-
tion, I have come to the conclusion that it must
have been rum. On this side, Dry, Sandy and
Stony Creeks can he crossed every mile. One
notable exception is Boosey Creek. Then we have
Hell Hole and Devil's Elbow, Nine Miles in
galore, Byaduk and Wail (is this where our
anti-Socialists come from ?). Places that turn the
letter-sorters grey-headed are Euroa, Genoa,
Murtoa, Longwood, Longfood, Broadford, Brad-
ford, Kergunyah, Waligunyah, etc. Then we
have Won, Wron, and Wonwondah. It does,
indeed, make one wmnder.
“10-2-4”: “Jimmie Pannikin” sings
(B. 3/10/’O7) of the glories of our wattle-clad bush
in spring. But give me the Australian coast and
seascape every time. Consider the gorgeous
Stretch of headland, beach, and ocean that opens
up before the early morning wayfarer as he tops
(say) the hill leading northwards to Narrabeen
(N.S.W.) on whichever fair October morning he
may choose. The nor’-easter isn’t off Newcastle
yet. Soft and dove-colored lies the ocean below,
mirror-smooth except where, along league upon
league of sand, its rim is shattering to white pow-
der. The shining wet beach is edged with bowed
trees, and a gauzy haze of surf-spray ever drifting
back from the line of breakers isn’t sub-tropical
any more, but an island strand, with limitless
possibilities in the way of “combers’’and copra-
traders and gentle flower-crowned niggers com-
muning with something that is slight and velvet-
coated—the wraith of R.L.S. Only for a moment
though, and then, in the still distance beyond the
last of the great bluffs that stride away to the
skyline, comes cleaving the Newcastle steamer.
And South Sea illusions die, being impossible
things in the presence of a Newcastle steamer.
What a riot of purest opal, pinks and greys, and
faint blues, the whole sea and coast is now. The
shadowing hills are still quite black, but the just-
risen sun has touched and made divine the washed
grass and shrubs on the flats, so that they shimmer
with every tint of green, from sage to faintest
emerald. And so, too, the ocean—our Pacific
Ocean, the flaunting beauty among the world’s
oceans. Just past the surf-line and near at hand
the sea shows cool glimpses of white sand amidst
its soft, blue lights ; further out, where lie the
weed-covered rocks, it is shot dull purple by the
sun; and thereafter away stretches the dead
polished, dove-color of the deep water till the
half-dispelled morning mists are reached. No
hand of man can ever vulgarise altogether the
haunted beauty of our coasts. The roads that
wind by the sea take on a weird charm, from their
environment, the fishermen’s humpies—aye, even
the awful “ Marine Residences for Gentlefolk ”
contrive to blend somehow (God knows how !)
with the scheme of things. The garish wattle in
its drab setting can’t compare as a color scheme
with the magic clear lights that shimmer along
our fine and rugged shores these gracious spring
mornings. “ J.P.’s” sense of proportion is atro-
phied, or he rises late.

After some people had hunted up abori-
ginal legends to explain the name of Willaura, in
the Western District (Vic.), where closer settle-
ment is trying to crowd out the big landlord, it
transpired that the surveyor who “laid out ” the
townships thereabouts ran short of cognomens, so
combined his own and his best girl’s first names,
and stuck the result on the area. He wasn’t over-
burdened with invention, but still he might have
gone to some old country for a second-hand mon-
niker and done worse. It recalls Queensland’s
Degilbo. The surveyor was obliged to find some
name for the- place, so he turned the “ obliged ”
upside down, and called it that.
THE HILL-TRACK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It olimbs its winding- way in the hills, and my spirit, too,
goes there.
Where the wind, with a note of the ocean, trills in aisles
of the upper air ;
Where great trees out of the brushwood lift a roof that is
high and green,
By huttrt ssed bole, and by root and rift, the track creeps
in between.
Through hazel scrub and the mountain musk, sassafras,
ash and fern ;
Deep-mossed nooks that are always dusk however the day
may burn;
Out and over the bald hill’s head, and a glimpse of the
homes of men—
The patchwork quilt of the farms, far spread—and into
the glades again 1
No furrow of plough has marked the soil, and the old
trees stand unmarred,
For these ways are apart from the ways of toil, and the
paths are steep and hard ;
The wild steers shoulder the thick scrub-box, and fee
dingo skulks and yells
As he hears, from his perch on the jutting rocks, the
clank of the cattle-bells.
This winding track that the beasts have worn in the
house of untrammelled things—
Beaten with hoof and cleared with horn through the halls
where the wild fowl sings—
Is a highway used, through the night and day, by the
feathered folk and furred,
The wallaby brown, and the squirrel grey, the fox and
the painted bird.
The black snake there leaves his scaly sign as he glides to
his bed of moss ;
The bandicoots snuffle and sniff and whine, as they
scuttle in fear across ;
The phalanger drops from his tree to hie in quest of a
daintier fare ;
And the dasyure slinks with a furtive eve at the sound of
the bird-notes there.
It’s a mystic way, the track in the hills, through the
house of the strange wild things,
Where a quavering note of the ocean trills in the halls
where the wild fowl sings ;
A narrow tortuous highway worn for the feathered folk
and furred—
Beaten by hoof and cleared by horn through the haunts
of beast and bird 1

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
iVo notice (except of a hostile character) will be taken of
communications insufficiently stamped. Name and
address must appear on MSS. No liabilicy is under-
taken re contributions voluntarily submitted, whether
sent by post or handed in; and no MS. will be

Subscriber : No public interest attaches to your
urgent plea that, some candidate will arise and oppose a
certain well-fed city councillor (no name given)
M.P.P. : Awful pun re Clara Butt declined.... Thomas
F. : The joke about “ his reverence ”is a trifle overdone.
Besides, yours are not new-laid jokes YV.F.B. : You
don’t even give the name of the person who got. seven
years for lifting some bread and cheese... .E.H.G. : Un-
equal in quality and faulty in metre Shon Mac:
Strained and artificial. The climbing-rabbit question has
been already threshed out in The Bulletin Tea-Tree :
Shows some poetic feelings....Lewin Crade: Couldn’t
use it, if those are the actual names S.P.B. : Became
“ W.P.8.” Romulus: Has no cause or relevance.
.. ..J.8.8. : Gives reasonable grounds for suspect-
ing yourself of the possession of red hair and
bandy legs .G.W.G.M. : As usual, handicapped by
lack of literary skill Lettice B! : Pretty well
written, but neither terse nor vigorous enough
F.E. : Rather better than most of the “Awake ! Arise l"
verse that comes to hand, yet not up to mark P.J.D. :
“ A Plea” is only pretty with a vague sort of prettiness.*
A.R.B. : “Haley’s Grave” rejected after a long, long,
profound, hesitating think Hori Poneke : Two bits of
verse about “ Gardens”—both just below' the mark
Southina: Impossible to acknowledge pars 0.N.8. :
One a mouldy chestnut, and that brings the other under
suspicion... .John Bell: Get Raleigh’s or Sydney Lee’s
Life of Shakspeare. It doesn’t seem to matter much
whether Bill’s dad or Bill’s daughter could read or write •
the point is that Bill could do both. And whether Bill
held horses outside pubs in London doesn’t matter either.
It is quite easy to hold horses outside pubs, anyway.
Mallet: “ Soliloquy on Spring ” won’t soliloquise in this
paper O.H.W. : “Whirligig of Time” is too badly
lacking in literary graces... .The Lyre : “ Earth-Grabber ”
and prose item about getting' a drink on Sunday rejected.
J.M.S. : “Bridle Path” a shade too conventional. The
dusk, the bush-track, the old hoss and the rider who
thinks sadly of one who is no more—they are old proper-
ties. The thing is well done, but the properties are too
aged Bushman : The end of the tale is good, but the
end is the only really good part of it. And the
writing is lamentable. Handed to junior clerk to return.
Junior clerk has resigned owing to inability to read
address, and his successor is struggling with it
Ralph S. : Your style is at present too loose and ineffec-
tive, but doubtless you will improve with practice
Shellback: Poor quality of verse Cretonne: Forcible,
but too “sultry” for print J.G. (Vic.): The trail of
the tyro is over it all Israel: A curious combination
of sense with silliness M.H.: “My Choice” is the best,
but it doesn’t quite catch on T.11.H. : Hardly bright
enough in the telling.... A.P. :It has no claims to print..
D. : Wouldn’t illustrate effectively Saphead: At
your age there’s hope for you Boulder: Too rough
and inartistic J.V.E. : Beautifully unintelligible
O.S.G. :It nearly squeezed in Miss A.R. : Six jokes ;
all rather mild jokes E.M.L.: Fact that the snake
was so long that it took five men to kill it duly noted
Machete: “Triolet Sequence” hardly gets far enough
away from 1000 other pretty things of the kind.'.. .J.D.G.:
Didn’t hit it this time F.W.M.: That joke has been
roaming over the wastes of art and literature for ever so
long Homo: “ Trigger” declined Ansonia : Not
bad, but it has been too often dealt with already
E. : Such a well-worn theme required a fresher
treatment H.W.W. : Hardly enough in it
H.G. : Rather hazy as to meaning Beaucaire :
Too insignificant... .A. 8.R.: “Invocation” is rather
wooden and spiritless D.W. : You come very
close up Wexie : Has good points—also bad ones
Eveline F. : There’s not much in either ; and another
contributor has a prior claim on that pseudonym.
.. ..M. : No. The University degree is one of the things
unification won’t affect. Everywhere there must always
be Universities whose degrees are, for one reason or
another, the most valued, and no change in the constitu-
tion is going to alter their style or status... H.E.C. :
Truly that professor is an ass ; but there isn’t room in this
paper to deal with all the asses Brumby : Fancy your
informant who tells of that Pacific Island community of
blue-eyed flaxen-haired white giants is a weird and blanky
liar. And what call, in any ease, is there for Australia to
fire missionaries into so peaceful a haven ? Where is the
sense in discharging unnecessary unpleasantnesses at pro-
blematical islands ?.... A.F. :in Westralia 74 per cent, of
males and 61 per cent, of females are between the ages of
15 and 65 ; while in Queensland there are 63 per cent, of
males and 56 per cent, of females between these ages.
But these things shouldn’t necessarily make Government
more costly. They only mean that there are fewer
children to educate in Westralia, and not so many aged
destitute to maintain. The water-supply business winch
you mention is a very small proportion of the State
revenue H.P. (M.L.) : “ Paper on Spiritualism ” failed
to make good. The writer capable of turning out a really
bright and acceptable paper on Spiritualism still lurks in
the remote womb of Time. ..Skinny Australian : Write any
sports depdt and ask for books on the “ Sandow ” system.
....Puzzled: The manufacturer wants Protection, even
though it will ultimately mean reduced prices, because it
will also mean a larger output, and it is better to sell
300,000 articles at a profit of 3d. each than 50,000 at a
profit of 6d. each. Moreover economy only begins to
coihe in when work is done on a big scale, and very often
rent, rates, water, lighting, supervision, and other items
are almost the same for an output of 300,000 articles as
for 50,000 Freezer : We are not sure that we don’t
sympathise with the Kernel, and, anyhow, your account
of how Turpenny’s name got mixed with that of Maher is
an even worse crime than the one it throws bricks at.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
J. Whiteoak : Pictures unsuitable, and cost 4d. for de-
ficient postage Pick: Sketch has some slight merit,
but the idea has been done to death Slim : One may
do as a suggestion. T’other only based on a pun.
Neither good enough for direct reproduction... Argent:
Only a picture of a Chow smoking and a skull in the dis-
tance. No demand for skulls in the distance... Bert R.:
The jokes mostly incline to be aged. Try to get original
subjects. Drawings show great promise considering
your youthfulness Alex. N. : Very crude drawing, and
idea so obvious that almost the same thing has .been
struck by half-a-dozen people.... Bob S. : Sketch of in-
famous-looking young woman telling admirer, with the
Bill Sikes jaw and immense feet, that her father’s “ a
red-hot Protectionist ” declined with extreme readiness.
H.R. : Picture of teetotal baby of no account....
G.R. : Picture of “ a bloke with brains” doesn’t seem to
attract us Jack Corr: Not much of a success either
pietorially or otherwise Tom F. : Dog picture and
gag about Squires cast to the four (or more) winds.

Handed over his baton at Bathurst
(N.S.W.) Sub-Inspector Parkinson (“Curly”),
aged 48. For 29 years he had been a limb
of the law. Deceased was, one time, prose-
cutor at the Sydney Water Police Court. He
held the world’s championship for remaining
under water alive—time, 4min. 6 l-ssec. —and the
high-diving record for Australia. Bathurst loses
a good policeman.
SAYLES, OF AUSTRALIA.
Victoria’s new County Court Judge
Moule’s first sentence was passed on a “ receiver”
who owned up to 15 previous convictions. His
Honor had intended to hand him three years’
hard labor, but, after perusing what he called a
“fair and nice” statement, and pondering over
the fact that accused had just married a young
wife, he gallantly reduced the term to 18 months.
Yet there are sure to be cynical people who will
say that what Judge Moule meant was that
marriage is equal to the other 18 months’ gaol.
It is hinted that a prominent Victorian
has found grace. A lot of people ejaculate : “So
much the worse for grace ! ”
Lysaght Bros, and Co., who own the wire-
netting factory that has been more talked about
in Federal politics this past week than all other
Australian industries put together, is mainly
Gibbs, Bright and Co. That much-pervading
firm nominates a majority of the directors on the
Lysaght Board.
One Frank Walker, of Hamilton (Vic.),
inherited £7OO last April. One day last week he
died with 305., his entire worldly possessions, in
his pocket. And there is no evidence that he
extracted a penn’orth of joy out of the other
£698 10s„ which mostly went in buying jimjams
at the fantod shop.
Parson Geo. Tregear, the anti-pub ex-
pounder of Melbourne, is an “amoosin’ little
cuss.” He issued a bombastic invitation to the
publicans of Footscray to attend a recent Beastly
Sunday Afternoon of his, adding that he would
brand them as contemptible cowards if they did
not attend. So a lot of them came, and when
George was quite through remarking that hotel-
keepers were all hogs and that anyone of them
would make his grandmother drunk to save 3d.,
one publican rose to say a few words in reply.
But immediately he opened his mouth Pastor
Tregear and his wild choir “ beefed out ” a hymn,
and drowned all criticism. Which is so very like
the preacher-man’s idea of a fair deal. He insults
the other fellow if he doesn’t come to his taber-
nacle ; he insults him when he does come; and
his push of hired bellowers is there to drown any
objection the other fellow may want to make over
being insulted.
Three pioneer miners went underground
at Ballarat last week. W. M. Gale was born in
the Isle of Man (where the cats have no tails) 70
years ago, and, after doing some sailoring, came
to the Victorian diggings in 1852. In a general
way of speaking, he bottomed on good stuff, and,
at one time or another, had interests in the Balla-
rat Banking Co., Gas Co., Mining Exchange Co.,
and other concerns. Edward Morey (cetat 75)
arrived in Adelaide in 1853, and moved on to
Ballarat with a mining party of sailors. Later,
he did some exploring in S.A. and Queensland,
and was owner of Linton Park Estate (Vic.). He
became M.L.C. for Wellington Province in 1899,
and was one of the establishers of Ballarat Stock
Exchange. He also found the wash fairly rich.
J. H. Williams came to Ballarat 50 years ago.
He was a director of the old Band and Albion
Consols Co., chairman of the North Woah Hawp
(Ballarat East) for 24 years, and was also asso-
ciated with the New Normanby and other con-
cerns. He helped to organise , the Ballarat
Miners’ Association, and to found the Ballarat
Woollen Mills Co. He died at the age of 83,
after panning out many good prospects, and it is
to be hoped that his experience in the next world
will run at least 3oz. to the ton.
Syd Kidman lately had a horse sale at
Kapunda (S. A.), and the auctioneer got an aver-
age of £l5 a head for 1300 animals, most of them
offered singly. Things have gone well with this
arm of the Kidman
family these last few
years. Besides one or
two not so well known,
there were three
brothers who bega to
get talked about only
12 or 15 years ago—
Sackville, Syd, and
Charley—all wonder-
ful judges of stock,
and fine bushmen.
Sack, reckoned the best
judge of cattle, died ;
and Charley (C.N. of
the turf) went West.
Syd cut in during the
drought, picked out
country that was
having a bad time, and
waited. Soon hestarted
out to advertise him-
self industriously as
“the Cattle King,”
which brought him
both buyers and sel-
lers ; then, picking his
drovers, the miles of
country he had got
hold of made it easy
for him to get the
hoofs to market. His
last purchase made
only the other week—
was Mt. Poole, for
years in the hands of
the Melbourne Langs,
and more or less famous
in the Far West be-
cause it was there that
explorer Sturt did his
historic “ perish.” The
Kidmans are in one
respect not a bit like
Billjim, the typical
Australian bushman.
Billjim can’t talk—the
Kidmans can talk from
Adelaide to Cape
York. And Syd es-
pecially knows the
great art of advt. At
his last big cattle sale in S. Aus., if a beast
ran up beyond the price he reckoned was a
fair thing, he would break in from his perch
alongside the auctioneer: “Fifteen quid! Too
much. Knock a quid off.” That is the sort of
thing to get a man talked of wherever they swap
lies and horses.
Premier Bent having boasted of his old-
time cricketing prowess, some enemy has fished
up an old copy of a “Cricketer’s Guide—Review
of the Season 1857-8 ” wherein appear the batting
averages of the Coast (Elsternwick) Club for
that season. The club comprised G. W.
Rusden, F. M. Selwyn, S. Lindray, F. J.
Price, E. Stephen, J. Goodson, T. Boxhall, two
Huddlestones, three Aggs and John and Thomas
Bent. The highest batting average was owned
by Goodson—ll innings for 165 runs —while
Thomas the Mighty of Old managed, in seven
innings, to knock up 41 runs, which works out at
the magnificent average of 5‘9. Still, this writer’s
record for his whole life was one innings and no
runs at all.
PARSIFAL’S PERILS.
The Methodist Conference passed a resolution warning members of the Church to abstain from dancing,
theatre going, and other questionable amusements, in view of the great moral and spiritual peril attaching
thereto.— Daily Paper.
That’s all right , hut what about the perils that lurk for young Parsifals in tea and
tennis afternoons ?
Plunkett, M.L.A., who bangs the Secesh
drum in the Queensland Assembly, lives at a
place called Tambourine. It’s appropriate, any-
way. The Bulletin never did think that Plun-
kett’s implement sounded important enough to be
a real drum.
Queensland Attorney-General Blair i.s not
obsessed by the dignity of his position. At
Ipswich, where he lives, there is a junior cricket
club named after him—Blair’s Cricket Club—and
“ Jimmy ” (everybody there calls him “Jimmy ”)
plays with it whenever he gets a chance. The
other day, in a match at Rosewood, he took seven
wickets for 28 runs; so his cricket is of the
strenuous variety.
Johnson, the N.S.W. Foreign-trader, has
been asking indignantly in the House of Reps, if
it is really true that the same duty is charged on
gin. lining boards as on gin. lining boards, and, if
so, why don’t the Heavens fall on Bill Lyne.
Yet Johnson is a man who knows so little of
timber that, up in the N. Territory, he sat down
to rest on an alligator thinking it was a tree.
“ Squidge ” holds forth
Little ’Arry VVeedon has been made Gaud Mayor of
Melbourne for the third year in succession. ’Arry, who
is rather bare in the matter of the letter “h,” and who
never finishes his sentences when he talks, represents the
compromise between Orange and Green in the Melbourne
City Council. He’s about the poorest thing in the way
of compromise that it would be possible to find,
but most compromises are. Anyway ’Arry is coming up
the straight for a knighthood. He wants the title
because he' thinks he deserves it. One of his failings
is his inability to see the “ why ”of anything. He thinks
that his financial genius, his bonhomie (he calls bonomi),
and h)s tense grip on public affairs have won him the
respect and affection of the people of Melbourne, and
that they delight to honor him. As a matter of fact, the
people of Melbourne think as much of him as of a fly on
the ceiling of the Town Hall. Still it is remarked on the
housetops that the G.-G. said he couldn’t do it last year,
but that he would do it if ’Arry scored three not out.
’Arry has scored the three, and now the G.-G. is to be
asked to toe the scratch. Four years ago it was 100 to 1
against Weedon ever being Gaud* Mayor. When he was
Gaud Mayor the first time it seemed 500 to 1 he would
never be chosen again. In his second year it looked
10,000 to 1 against a third term. The little G.-G. seems
to have gambled on the 10,000 to 1, and he’s lost. ’Arry
confidently expects to see his name among the birth-
day honors next month, and has got a bust sculped by
John White in anticipation.
“ G.H.” writes about Nelken :
Leo (not Leon) Nelken, whose monster Freetrade dem-
onstration at Sydney Town Hall declined to amount to a
cent, seems to have a Nemesis or some other fatal sub-
stance on his track. Brer Nelken, an American Jew, was
formerly connected with the Melbourne office of a Yankee
life assurance co. ; and in'those days Leo’s bell-topper
shed a solar radiance along that part of the Rue
Collins where the Willie-boys and chorus-girls most do
congregate. Three or four years ago, however, the con-
nection between Leo and the assurance co. was broken or
torn or sawn off or something, and The Block lost sight
for'a space of the ginger-complexioned little man with
the beautiful waist and the impressive hat.
After a while he bobbed up again, but in more subdued
raiment, as the grand chief promoter of Everybody’s of
Australia, a magazine on the same lines, so Nelken said,
as the American Everybody’s. Rumor said that its con-
tents were to flabbergast this continent. Deakin, so
the story ran, was to be editor-in-chief at a salary of
£2,000,000 per annum; W. H. Croker was to hold
forth on butter commissions and deportment; Newton
Griffiths was to, give his views on the Australian stage ;
a dozen other eminent persons were to shed vast quanti-
ties of light on special subjects ; and Mr. Leo Nelken—
the Lawson of Australia—was to give the assurance com-
panies Hell. But a slump occurred. It was rumored that
Deakin stuck out for an extra million per annum, or that
the Assurance companies, terrified by the threatened
revelations, had paid £7,000,000 to squash the project.
Then Brer Nelken—shaking Parliament House off his
feet—became a tender memory and a fleeting dream.
The Town Hall venture, where Leo was billed to heave
language and magic-lantern slides at the Australian
Government, seems to have been trodden on by some in-
visible foot with capital in its hand, and one pictures Leo
as flying before the avenging spectre of Splosh. It is a
pity; for Nelken’s song-and-dance, if it had occurred,
wouldn’t have hurt Australia much.
W. P. Crick rolls his swag for England in
December to argue his appeal before the Privy
Council against the judgment which made
him no longer a Gentlemen One before
N.S.W. Supreme Court. If he appears in the
shockingly untidy hat which he wears when
making holiday in the country he will be:h revela-
tion to the ancient, grave and doddersojne mem-
bers of the Council. B. R. Wise* K.C., will
probably put an immaculate bell-topper on the
Council table, and help to take up the parable on
Crick’s behalf. \
Schoolmaster G. Metcalfe maintains an
attitude of excitement and applause these days in
consequence of so many of his early pupils having
come to the front in N.B/W. politics; While
facing what he thinks to be an attentive world,
he counts on his fingers J. H. Carrqthers, ex-
Premier; Thomas Waddell, Treasurer; and the
semi-clerical Moore, who, takes over the Lands,
and then he gives three cheers for himself. The
result is fairly good, regarded as a matter of quan-
tity, for one simple bush schoolmaster, but the
quality might be improved upon.
Ebsworth, the Melbourne barrister who
was fined £lO for appearing in a Tas. court
without having bqen admitted to practice in that
small State, was formerly a seaman, and rose to
the rank of second mate before he started study-
ing law. Since he commenced practice in Mel-
bourne, Ebsworth has devoted himself mainly to
nautical matters, and was an eternal thorn in the
side of ex-P.M. Panton. As president of the
Vic. Court of Marine inquiry, Panton was par-
ticularly proud'of his knowledge of things marine,
and every time Ebsworth proved him to be a pit-
fall and a mere longshoreman and wharf lumper
he was really angry.
Died at Clayfield (Brisbane), on September
14, aged 79, Samuel Brown, who had more than
his share of bad luck. He came to Australia in
1849, and after a few months’ jackerooing near
Geelong (Vic.), went- to Queensland with a
brother-in-law who had been managing a station
of Ben Boyd’s, near Bathurst. The partnership
lasted 12 years, and in that time the pair got hold
of five stations. On one of them (Cooroora) 11,000
sheep died in three days in 1875, from cold rain
following upon a drought. Ten years later, on
the same station, Brown lost all his sheep, and
by-and-bye he lost most of his cash through
another drought. Left only with Ingleston, he
had just got things fairly going again when the
bank smash finally ruined him. He then got a
job in the Queensland Lands Department, where,
if he had less cash, he had more peace of mind.
OLD BILL LYNE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(Written before he backed down on the wire-netting.)
Who is this that, big and burly,
All the time, both late and early—
Be it wet or fine—
Faces all his foes right gamely,
Never takes an insult tamely ?
Why, it’s old Bill Lyne.
Forrest goes, and snarls while leaving ;
Says that Bill is aye deceiving—
Always wants to shine.
Back there comes an answer mocking,
With a noise that’s really shocking.
It’s from old Bill Lyne.
Cook and Reid are always barking,
Wilks, from Dailey, ’s often larking,
Brown and Wilson whine.
But they really do not matter ;
One and all they break and scatter—
Off from old Bill Lyne.
Like a lot of blow-flies droning,
Vou can hear Bill’s foes bemoaning,
Breathing threats condign.
Then they lay a trap to do it;
But their prey just blunders through it;
For it’s old Bill Lyne.
Nights on nights they growl and worry,
Want the tariff in a hurry,
Which is all moonshine.
But one man they cannot bustle,
Doesn’t matter how they hustle,
And it’s old Bill Lyne.
Who is it that’s never tired ?
Always ready when required ?
Stand up, friend o’ mine !
Solid, good, Australian fighter,
May he sit his seat still tighter,
Here’s to old Bill Lyne !

The celebrated 1900 Vintage of “ Charles
Heidsieck ” Champagne, one of the very best of
late years, is still being shipped to Australia,
though, as stocks are getting low at Reims, the
agents —Messrs. Swift and Co., 32 O’Connell-
street, Sydney—inform us they expect a later
year’s Wine will be shortly coming forward. The
Champagne shipped here is similar to that sent
to London and principal European Cities, Mr.
Charles Heidsieck only vintaging one quality.
It has the Royal Warrant of H.M. King
Edward VII., and is supplied to the House of
'Commons,. British Government, etc.*

Cattle-duffing isn’t wholly a lost art. Ivan
Solly (15| years) burgled a heifer off one of Ade-

The animal fetched £llss. Flushed with victory,
Ivan snared a gelding (value £7 10s.), and, if a
policeman hadn’t arrested him about here, it is
quite possible he would have taken the loan of a
lion out of the Zoo or borrowed a tramcar and its

SUPERFLUOUS HAlR.— This is the most dis-

wise beautiful women are made utterly miserable
because of this unhappy affliction. “ Rusmo ”is
the best hair killer in the world. It won’t, mind
you, remove those little hairs for ever and ever —
only electricity will do this—but Rusmo Hair
Killer will certainly make them instantly dis-
appear for the time, and so weaken their growth
that they will be slow to return. This alone is
great relief. Not only that, but all that is neces-
sary can be done at home in very simple fashion,
and in absolute privacy. Rusmo costs ss. 3d. a bottle.

SEMPER IDEM
FACILE PR/NCEPS
A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, October 15, 1907.
My Dear Arini,—
It has come at last. In a Melb. suburban court
case between mistress and servant, the other day,
the servant complained that her mistress had
made her bad-tempered by going out in her (the
servant’s) best dress.
Face decoration in all its forms of powdering,
panelling, fleur-de-lis or fleur-de-riz, and other
tracery, must have gone out of fashion here, as it
has in London—that is, amongst the Somebodies,
and the Anybodies who are so nearly Somebodies
that they can cut the Nobodies. A friend in the
mid stream of the society whirlers denounced of
Father Vaughan, writes me that the smartest
women in Bull Town have given up tapestry of
the face, and just dab the countenance with elder-
flower water, and afterwards dust it with
powdered oatmeal. At our recent bunch of
A.J.C. races our Australasian women wore the
complexions which it has pleased God to give
or leave them, Mostly they showed frank
signs of bereavement of the great ornament.
We must be living into an honester, uglier
time. Stage stars are noted for their no-paint-out-
of-trade-hours creed. Mrs. Maud Jeffries-Osborne
“ never put on any ” when off the stage, and now
her complexion is of paper whiteness. Her friends
wish that she would consume large quantities of
chops and claret, or else that some of her hus-
band’s complexion were catching. The Osbornes
are a ruddy clan, like the men in boots who came
over the Himalayas and conquered the men in
petticoats. Maud’s fair face got a still colder and
more marble-like tone from the deep agonised
mauve of her hat. Her raiment was otherwise in
tender, faint tones of mauve. But the super-
mauve roof was calamitous.
Miss Rawson’s frocking is getting so smart that
perhaps the First Girl in the State is beginning
to take notice. At the garden party given by her
father and self to taper off the race week, it was an
inspired confection of white crespe-de-chine,
Limerick lace, and satin, embroidered with roses
in pastel shades of silk. A big picture-hat, with
mauve and white flowers, was in accord with the
symphony.
A clutch of girls, who would be quite eligible
for The Lone Hand Beauty Quest, prankt the
lawns at the garden party (I hope “prankt” is a
suitable verb, though “prank,” as a proper word, is
scarcely realisable). Among them was the Dorothy
Bedford girl—she is niece of Mrs. Monty Severn.
Her frocking was in a diaphanous silky thing of
the shade known as honeysuckle yellow—when
the ’suckle withers, probably. It was more a
light bee shade. The bee carries several subtle
variations of yellow about its hardworking
person. Anyhow it was a sweet thing in yellow,
and the girl in it had yellow hair, and turquoises
in her ears. Then there were the Ina Cornish
girl, a packet of the S. W. Moore girls, and a
bunch of young married women—all eligible for
the Beauty Quest.
Heliotrope shows up well against green lawns
but there’s so much of that shade trailing over
the face of Nature that one wishes helio were
“off.” Rose du Barri, being a difficult shade of
pink to wear, gets a small innings and a lot of
notice (from the woman who can’t wear it). Mrs.
Reggie Broomfield, who looks as if she’d fed on
chocolates and coffee, easily stood the Rose du
Barri test.
At the vice-regal garden party Miss Beatrice
Grimshaw, the writer, took the collective eye in
grey chiffon, old honiton lace, and a black hat.
She is a slightly smaller daughter of Anak than
our other distinguished visitor, Clara Butt, but
she is distinctly a member of the Anak family.
“Midnight Wedding” Maud Mclntosh is
proving herself a dresser of the first grade. She
doesn’t greatly fancy “the eternal charm of
fluffiness,” and seems to cling to the clothes that
cling to her, rather than to those that billow and
float abroad on lawns and summer winds and into
the faces of passers-by.
On Saturday, at Randwick, the sportive wind—
not a breeze, but a bold, vulgar, gusty wind—
blew a damsel’s feather boa twice around a
stranger-man’s neck. It was a fluffy enough
anaconda to start with, but to make it more
frivolous, she had put small winged things like
day-old chickens at intervals in the three yards of
feathery fluff. The noosed male looked em-
barrassed. The damsel did as most women do
under such circumstances —she took on an expres-
sion of hostile propriety, as if to say, “You dare
to think that my intentions are not strictly
honorable ! ” Who was it said that “ woman is the
last thing to be civilised by man”? I wish he’d hurry
his civilising measures. On the crowded grand
stand on Saturday I moved to make room for a
lady (in black grenadine over white silk) whom I
mistook for an acquaintance, and she halted, gave
me an outraged eye, and passed on to (I am sure)
summon a policeman or consult “Etiquette for
Australians.”
But to get back to M. Me. Her achievement
on Saturday on the Randwick stage was an Irish
crochet gown with a dado of painted silk, and in
her close-fitting toque were’ three big rosettes of
tulle (or net) in black, petrol green, and
thundercloud blue. It was a really stormy
combination. A kind friend told me on
leaving the course that she had found out the
whatness of the muddy, bilious-looking “ petrol ”
green. It is the color of the oil of that name—
the oil itself, not the smell; the smell is brown.
I believe a chauffeur told her. The motor-car and
its etceteras have got into literature and the
fashions —to say nothing of the ditches and the
morgue. The black chiffon coat carried by M.
Me. was given her by Mrs. Humphrey Ward when
the artiste played in the novelist’s dramatisation
of her “Eleanore.”
The quantity of lilac muslins and the revival of
China crepe at recent A.J.C. races remind of a
description from Mrs. Waddjngton’s pleasant
memoirs, “First Glimpses of Diplomatic Life,”
lately begun in an American maga. She,
an American (married to a foreign Ambas-
sador), writing in 1857, remarks that she went
to the races “in my lilac muslin with the
three flounces, which we bought in Paris, and my
China shawl.” At a grand ball she wore
her wedding dress, cut low. It had three flounces
of lace. Her bouquet was of pink camellias and
heliotrope. It was very heavy, but smelt sweetly.
One of the noticeable frocks blowing about on
race week was Mrs. Milton King’s grey chiffon
with trails of grey-blue wistaria, embroidered in
raised silk all over the bodice, and on the skirt
hundreds of butterflies—a visitation of butterflies
of which no two were alike. It w 7 as the most
striped week in anyone’s recollection—every
third girl or woman went in for zebra effects
either in hair-line or stripes wide as a footpath.
Not many novelties were abroad. A stage lady
carried a Jap paper umbrella. Miss Gwladys
Bonsor, who was a “ striper,” had one of the new
throatlets made of lace and muslin thrust through
an ornamental slide of enamel and turquoise.
Mrs. Clara Butt is complaining to her entourage
(that’s a good word) that she is wilting under the
strain of being entertained. She finds it more of
a burden than subduing the Town Hall organ
with her Voice. Yesterday the Women’s Liberal
Club gave the melodious giantess a reception at
their difficult -to - find rooms in King-street.
Beautiful Butt stumbled in wearingsomethingblue,
silken and expensive, punctuated with guipure
and silver, and a big, inverted-bowl hat on the
back of her hair. When standing in repose the
artiste is that rare bird—a very tall woman who
isquite graceful. Shehas nohint of awkwardness or
stoop, but her walk is a stumble. Her audiences
in or out of the Town Hall can’t get a glimpse of
her feet, so long in front are her gowns. The Liberal
Club ladies justified their name by giving the
artiste a case of six gold teaspoons with Australian
fauna wrought on the handles. The emu tea-
spoon, the kangaroo teaspoon, and the ’possum
teaspoon—these will do for (respectively) little
Joy, Roy, and Toy, for so the Large Lady desig-
nates her young family. The other three tea-
spoons, platypus, magpie, and wallaby, will come
in handy for little Boy, Coy, and MarkFoy, when
they arrive. I make the Singer a present of these
words. If she wants rhyming names of one
syllable she’ll have to stop at the last, for there’s
a limited choice.
For the rest. I would like to know how rich
you must be before you can get gold teaspoons
and other valuable presentations ? Premieress
Wade, in a lace frock and a pink hat, seemed to
swoon behind the huge presentation bouquet as
she waited for the guest. Mrs. Minter, a charm-
ingly diplomatic and prettily-frocked Clubbite,
gave Mrs. Wade her moral support, while Mrs.
M. Parkes and a colossal-eyed lady named
McKinnon and Senatrix Gould helped in the
spreading of butter over the mammoth song bird.
Four debutantes spread their callow wings at
the Australian Club Ball—Miss Eileen Cumming,
a Rose Bay girl; Miss Phyllis Smith, of Molong ;
Miss Enid Bailey, and Miss Windeyer, of New-
castle. The club is said to have spent £7OO on its
floral decorations alone. If that’s a fib, it is, at
least, a flowery fib, and a bright, cheerful distor-
tion of fact.
The City Council is brooding upon a new
scheme —the erection of women’s waiting and
dressing rooms at the Quay and elsewhere. There
—when there is a there—women might get into
evening dress, or climb out of evening dress and
into “their other clothes,” do their hair, and
primp generally. It is to be hoped the City
Council’s wife or other feminine possessions will
tell it that one woman may occupy one mirror for
three hours, and have a lien on a second for view-
ing her back hair and the hang of her skirt.
Therefore, the Council must put in heaps and
stacks of mirrors. (Besides, you get a reduction
on taking a quantity of mirrors.) Most women
can dress in an hour and a half, but they must
have another hour or more to scrutinise the effect
of the dressing from all the points of the compass.
The other night, in a theatre dressing-room, a
woman held the strategic position opposite the
main mirror for 12 minutes while she put in and
took out her jewelled back-comb, holding a hand-
mirror the while. She tried it high, she tried it
low. There was no other way to try it except
medium, but she stuck and re-stuck until a man
put his head in at the door and said, “ The first
act is half over.” She replied, “ I shall not w 7 ear
the new comb until I have a chance of trying it
on at leisure. Will you put it in your overcoat
pocket ? ” Then she spent another eight minutes
over her theatre-coat, and finally marched into
the circle with one arm only in its sleeve. The
other sleeve she drew under her bare other arm,
doubtless thinking how unconventional and
picturesque she looked. Her troubles about the
play ! The intervals with the lights up was
what she went to the theatre for.
A distinguished visitor is staying with her
married daughter at Mosrnan—Queen Emma of
the New Hebrides. She mostly lives at New
Britain (if these statements won’t fit in with
history and geography, I disclaim all responsi-
bility), and is a most stately lady, who comes to
Sydney to choose fashionable clothes. Her con-
sort is a German gentleman named Kolbe.
While on the subject of potentates: King
George, of Tonga, is thinking of marrying
again, and may come to Auckland or Sydney for
a consort. There was some question of his
acquiring a German wife. He is said to be a
handsome man with more orders and medals on
his chest than the Emperor William. He is 33
years of age, and has been a widower for some
time, Queen Lavinia having left this world in
1902. George’s real name and title is Jioaji Tubou
11. Jioaji Tubou 1., his predecessor and great-
grandfather, tottered on the throne till he was
over 90. The population of the islands, I am
told, is mostly dead, and those who survive are
mostly Wesleyans. Also, British authority runs
the show to a great extent, and Tubou 11. is
rather a shadowy potentate. Therefore there is
less inducement to rush the billet than might be
supposed.
Baronet Wilfrid Peek, who is a passenger to
Sydney per Orontes —as is Dan O’Connor—has
just turned into h's 24t,h venr. His grandfather,
the first baronet, was the head of the firm of
Brothers, tea and coffee dealers and spice mer-
chants, and had an office in Eastcheap, London-
There isn’t any baroness —this over-girled com-
munity will be glad to learn.
Mrs. J. H. P. Murray left for Europe on Satur-
day, with her two children, by the Marathon.
The youngsters are going to be tutored in Switzer-
land, where Mrs. Murray will stay, among lakes
and glaciers, while her husband, Judge Murray,
is wiping the globules of heat from his forehead
in steamy Papua, where he is Administrator.
Mrs. Murray is a member of the Jenkins family.
Her father was a doctor, who wisely gave up
medicine for squatting. The seasons were kind
to him. Two of the big family runs—one in
Queensland and another on the Macintyre River,
in N.S.W.—are now in the market —both freehold
estates, with big musters of stock. Dr. Jenkins,
the well-known Macquarie-street medicine man,
is a son of the original doctor. Another son is
master of the magnificent Stonehenge property.
In the vestibule of N.S.W. State Parliament
House there hangs a portrait group of members of
the first N.S.W. Parliament. In this group figure
Dr. Jenkins and Terence Aubrey Murray, after-
wards Speaker—“ with a voice like a band
of music,” as Dan O’Connor once eloquently
observed—father of the present Papuan Adminis-
trator. The latter was a brilliant Oxford man,
and is master of many tongues. In addition he
is a mighty swordsman, and owns a great silver
cup, recording the fact that he was once the cham-
pion amateur boxer of England. Another brother,
George, smashed almost every scholastic record
at Oxford, was Professor of Greek at Glasgow at
24, married a daughter of a “belted earl,” the
Earl of Carlisle, and now produces Greek plays
for the Court Theatre. Harvard University
recently imported him to talk to the Yanks on
Greek. He has a polished literary manner in
prose and verse.
Millionairess Eadith Walker has earned some
money—los. consolation prize from the Sunday
Times for a line in a Limerick. The line is not
published, but the lady has been given half a
pound for it, and by now has most likely driven
around in her 1000-guinea motor-car to collect.
As it is probably the first money she has ever
earned, the lady will doubtless have it framed, or
something, to make it an heiressloom.
Lord Northcote has put up a Cup for inter-
state yachting contests ; so saltwater sports are
waving their tins with satisfaction, and throwing
garlands of fish and seaweed at his Excellency.
The first instalment of a Dress Symposium in
the November number of The Lone Hand will be
contributed by Miss Grace Palotta, who pleads
for Simplicity. (Accurately, “ Grace Palotta
preaches Simplicity.”) Miss H. C. McG. writes
on “ Dress and the Woman,” and Miss Conor-
O’Brien asks of “ The Hat: Is it a Devil ?”
At the opening of the State Parliament gambol
the new quarters for the Premier made the guests
break into enthusiastic comment that sounded like
a patter song. They are built on to the tennis
lawn in the style of a suburban villa, with a red-
tiled verandah, furnishings in modern style, cool-
looking walls in green and white, cathedral glass,
and a very comfortable bedroom. The walls are
adorned with various pictures, and in the hall are
models of our own particular fish and some
pedestals of Australian woods. These are the
quarters which Mr. Carruthers used to visit while
they were in course of construction, and con-
sider with the eye of the king who builds himself
a new palace. And there, it is said, he often
used to find Mr. M‘Gowen also considering the
premises with the aspect of the heir-apparent
who tags along behind the king when he goes to
look at his new palace, and suggests Death —
political Death.
Miss Daisy Doudney, who last month was
wedded to Mr. Sou tar at St. Philip’s, represented
a family that had quite a habit of going to that
place of worship on that errand. In 1820 her
great-grandfather, Mr. Thomas Glover, was
married in old St. Philip’s by Archdeacon
Cowper. Her grandfather was married at old
St. Philip’s, and her hither at new St. Philip’s.
Thomas Glover owned a property in Kent-street
(near the gasworks) before the street was cut
down, and when it was as humpy as a camel’s
back, and (like the beginning of Genesis) was with-
out form and void. These facts are supplied by an
old gentleman of my acquaintance, and if they
are inaccurate I am not responsible for them.
There are better things sometimes than being a
landowner and aristocrat —however bloated. In
Ireland an an ti-Home Rule peer, by name Ash town,
constitutes a living exemplar of the great truth
that life in the case of the British lord is far, far
from being all strong drink and chorus girl. The
Ashtown peer, who owns 22,000 acres of land in
Galway, arrived on his acres the other day
for some quiet shooting. What occurred? Was
he welcomed? Did the tenantry turn out and
present forelocks? Far from it. The very next
morning a melinite bomb was placed in the
front parlor of the Ashtown humpy and the
entire suite of furniture ruined. When Ash-
town walks about Woodlawn, his estate in
Co. Galway, he is (says Lloyds) “constantly
under police protection.” A constable assists the
family butler to open the hall-door —a job that
needs to be done with infinite caution and much
reconnoitring—and another member of the force
sleeps in a passage near the bloated one’s bedroom
door. When the owner of the surplus mass of
acres in Galway visits the local village for a shave
or anything, “ a policeman armed with a rifle
goes on ahead and another follows on a bicycle
close behind.” The life must be jumpy to a
degree, and recalls the state of affairs the Anti-
Sosh crowd prophesied last year for the Common-
wealth unless G. Reid was immediately made
Prime Minister.
The British Barts, feel they have been put upon
of late, and not given their due meed of respect.
In fact, as a crowd, gang, or conglomeration,
their grievances have for long been as multi-
tudinous and bitter as those of Australia’s
agonised old Ma State herself. They had a meet-
ing the other day (at least some of them had) and
vehemently shook the finger of scorn and dislike
at the type of outcast who is wont to masquerade
as a Bart, without really being one. Also, they
orated longand loudly onother subjects, and passed
resolutions. That meeting wasn’t the Jawbone-
Neild-Nelken sort of fizzle that our anti-tariffists
in these parts are accustoming us to, but has been
productive of a few very useful results. Take, for
example, the dogged attitude it has induced in
him whom Debrett styles “the Hon. Sir S.
Maryon-Wilson, Bart., of Kent.” Some im-
possible creature wrote to “ the Hon. Sir S.” etc.,
and began the screed with the words “Dear Sir”!
Whereat the outraged Bart, administered to the
writer a rebuke, sharp as it was neat. The letter,
says John Bull —an English publication which
has forgotten more about Barts, and knights than
the normal un-Bull-like person ever knew—was
returned, with the word “Dear” struck firmly out
“by a bold red cross.” And the following printed
form was attached :
There is a strong feeling amongst baronets that the
expression “ Dear Sir,” which is constantly used in coin-
men eirig a letter nowadays by, and to, upper servants,
clerks in small offices, and many other persons who are
much below the social status of a baronet, is not only in-
correct and incongruous, but is also very discourteous
when used to Members of this Ancient and Hereditary
Degree. I will therefore ask you in future to kindly com-
mence your letters to me “Sir Baronet” instead of
“ Dear Sir.”
If that doesn’t fix the Barts, in their correct social
niche, nothing will.
“ Mario,” from Brisbane :
The viceroy and his dame, having departed for southern
climes, leaving the Du Oane in charge, that lady, along
with Mrs. Ramsay, of Harrow, shed a faint flicker on the
October meeting of the Q.T.O. on Saturday, when the
premier club ran a sparsely-attended afternoon of sport.
The last race was productive of a mishap that might
easily have been a tragedy. Lismore fell right in the
middle of the ruck. How the other neddies got clear,
and how the rider escaped with a scratch or two, good-
ness only knows.
The mission ffite, which fizzled feebly on the grounds
at Bishopsbourne on Saturdays, was the same old
rehash of the same old faces, and the owners of the fac< s
were done for 9d. in every Is. expended in the same old
way.
There is talk of much trouble in the Central City
Refuge. As the Archbishop is the Chief Executive
Officer, and the President of Committee is an ex-Matron
of the Children’s Hospital, and one at least of the Com-
mittee is a duly'certificated nurse, Heaven alone knows
how the muddlement occurred. The fact remains, how-
ever, that the infant mortality is a staggerer. If the
rumor is true that £7OOO lies at the disposal of those in
authority for improvements, why don’t the reforms get
attended to ?
The knot of the Nelson-Bird alliance was tied in the
sweltering heat of Thursday last at St. Luke’s, with no
end of frill. The wedding toilette was of chiffon gauze over
satin, and veiled with Limerick lace. The two maids,
the Misses O’Reilly, budded in girly-girly white muslin
frocks, carrying baskets of pink sweet pea, and were just
the tiling. Bride and groom are now residing at the
Hotel Australia.
The Children’s Ball, in aid of the procrastinating
Children’s Hospital, was a dead frost, which not even the
presence of the vice-regal buds in floral array could
thaw.
“ Rosna” writes from Adelaide :
The Hunt Club races were a great and festive picnic.
All the pedigreed folk took the best table-linen out of
its glass case, filled up the motor with champagne and
oysters, and had luncheon in picturesque and jural
simplicity. When you are accustomed, as we in Adelaide
are, to 16 powdered footmen behind your chair o’ meals,
it is great fun to pass the salad personally by hand, and
rescue cross and drowning spiders from the dressing.
There was some goodly frocking abroad, mostly of the
pinafore order, with millinery flower-laden, and lurching
weirdly over the back-hair. Lady 7 Le Hunte was there
in a pretty tussore silk and cream toque, with Miss Clowes
in blue and white muslin. Mrs. Richard Hawker, chief
hostess of the affair, wore cream silk muslin ; and Mrs.
Albion Tolley was in dreamy, flowery, chiffony raiment.
Mrs. J. H. A. Lee decorated a navy silk gown and green
toque, and Mrs. L. Bonython a very glorious erection of
pale blue, embroidered silk, with a blue and pink crown-
ing glory. One of the most striking frocks was a browny-
blue shot silk, worn by Mrs. Bosley Jenkins, who had
some long waving feathers in her brown hat.
Mrs. William Campbell, Mrs. Lendon, Mrs. Wigg, and
Mrs. Gill collaborated in a fancy-dress ball, the other
evening, for the gilded infants of the State. (I use the
term infants in its legal and not literal sense.) There
were many quaintly-garbed kiddies, and one or two quite
gorgeously arrayed. The two little Poulton girls were
short-waisted, early Victorian maidens, quaintly coiffed.
Dorothy Lendon made an adorable Marquise. Alice
Campbell, resplendent in yellow satin and a plumed hat,
was a tall and graceful Anne Hyde (she who married
James 11. or one of the other Rexes of Britain), and
wielded her lengthy train most scientifically 7. Dorothy
Young, in a wisteria-embroidered kimona, made the Jap-
piest of little Japs. The young he-population went
mostly as bushrangers and other bloodthirsty ruffians.
Their Exes, have been rusticating with the C. 11.
Angases at Lindsay Park, where the sheep grow (or is it
kine ?). The place really has a park, and is not called one
because there is a loquat tree in the middle of the lawn.
From there his Ex. took an exciting drive or two to the
neighboring townships, surveyed the wheat crops, patted
the local schools on the head, and had the “Song of Aus-
tralia ” sung at him.
The Herbert Rymills are rejoicing over the arrival of a
son and heir, which reminds me that Adelaide artist
Hayley Lever has laden his defenceless infant with the
names “Elener Domenico.” Truly these are splendid
encumbrances. The sponsors are, I believe, a distinguished
painter and a celebrated musician, and if Elener Domenico
ever manages to stagger to manhood he will certainly be
expected to wear long hair and a blue sash.
Lizzie Newbold fell in for a piece of good fortune when
she rushed home from these parts to warble her best bird
notes for Melba the Glorious. The expressed the
opinion that the youthful nightingale’s voice is a charm-
ing one, and forthwith sat herself down and gave her a
20-minutes lesson, and requested to hear her again in a
month’s time. When one remembers the hundreds of
would-be songstresses who would give their ears to sing a
line for Melba, and the horde of clamoring parents who
beset the path of that good-natured Queen of Song in
the hope of enlisting her interest, one may conclude that
the little Newbold girl was considerably in luck. I read
somewhere that in Edward’s Isle Melba often has as
many as 200 requests a day from people who only want
her to hear their top G’s, and give an opinion on ’em.
And this record is bound to be beaten in Australia,
where voices grow wild on the trees and hedges.
Yours Affectionately, AKENEHI.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, October 14, 1907.
My Dear Yarrik, —
A very famous Australienne considers the
dubious joys of matrimony—at least it is so
alleged. The happy man (so they say), who may
have the privilege of being curtain-lectured by
a voice more precious than a King’s ransom, is a
widower—a Roman-nosed widower, with a fortune
and a cherub or two as mementoes of his defunct
wife. He dances constant courtly attendance
upon his divinity, which proceedings she tolerates
with intoxicating grace. But only to a grand
attack will the goddess capitulate. It must be
hard to be masterful to a singing angel, yet that’s
the only way to capture women for slaves and
arch deities for wives.
Lady Northcote gave a charming musical “ At
Home” on Friday. Music and chatter were
softly wedded in one of the prettiest of the draw-
ing-rooms—with big, comfy blue-clad lounges in
serried sedateness from one end to the other and a
church aisle between. Mr. Clarionet Mortimer,
Elvins at the piano, played a concerto.
1 hen Miss Carmen Pinschof and Miss Hesketh
Jones, backed by Mr. Wade and Mr. Dun-
lop, sang the Brahms “ Waltzes.” Sweet
songs they are, and the voices were as
sweet. Carmen Pinschof looked mightily pretty,
too, with the soft light from a stained-glass
window behind her, and a halo-hat of sea-colored
silk, and huge, fluffy, soft white plumes like
spindrift.
After the waltzes came an interval, and
there a was frilly, fluffy rustle into tea. No
buffet scramble, but just the billiard-room full of
dainty tables, and the windows wide open to the
terrace and lawn. The Northcote dame has a
fine sense of decoration, and is fond of using wild
flowers for adornment. The room was full of
wild boronia, with its fine fragrance and ivory-
tinted flowers.
After tea, the company drifted back for more
music. Heard some of the men-folk whispering
anxiously if it were “ polite to go now ? ” But
they were hauled back to the blue seats, and
forced to listen to ‘‘Trombone Trios.” But
things brightened considerably when some very
pretty girls, accompanied by more pretty girls at
and piano, sang something delicate about
Snow.” It is a cantata with which the
Exhibition Choir intends to bombard an audience
later.
The Caulfield Guineas struggled hard for its
usual weather—which is Bad—but resolved itself
into quite a passable afternoon. For half-an-hour
or so the frilly frockers bloomed about the lawn
like roses, while the tailor-mades sweltered and
wondered why they hadn’t frocked. Suddenly a
squalling, shrieking wind would blast—quite im-
promptu. Then was the triumphant hour of the
tailor-mades, who smiled complacently at the
awful exhibition of unhappy swirl among the
flimsies.
The authorities have put a fresh back to the
vice-regal pen. Now it is as sheltered and deep
as a nice sleepy family pew in an ancient church,
ihe Northcote Lady topped her powder blue
draperies with funereal black plumes. Mrs.
Vallange was all sweet and droopy in brown, with
floating fringe like seaweed ; even her hat had a
shimmering, drooping, sea-plant air. It was
brown, with soft dead pinks and blues
ana greens in the osprey drooping in the
fashionable tilt over one ear. Ruby Madden
was just as assertive as Sister Vallange was
pensive. She wore oranges in her huge
hat; startling big golden oranges. The
youthful Leslie maiden draped herself ,in a
much-trimmed matronly-looking black dress,
with a rather squelching black hat and
the snow-streak hair well in evidence. Mrs.
“Bob” Power (her lioness was not there) was
quite subdued in cream color. She had such a
pretty girl with her part of the day—a girl with
a small dark face framed in a grey veil, and her
slim body tailored in pale grey. One could hear
Mrs. Norton Grim wade’s suit round the corner ;
the check was a .frantic shout and the hat a
hurrah. The frame, like a cartwheel, held purple
plumes standing on end in unholy horror, and the
rest of the fixings were fuchsias—lurid red and
purple fuchsias. The Manifolds were in quiet
evidence. Popper’s horse Subterranean did not do
what was expected of it at the Guineas; but there’s
lots of talk for the Cup. How giddy some grey-
haired folk get in race gowns ! Mrs. Harold Kent,
tall and dignified, wore a toque with horrible
indigestible green cherries bobbing and dangling
in her eyes and over her ears, and, flying in long
streamers, was scarlet ribbon, just to contrast the
unripeness of the cherry bobs. Mrs. Justice
Isaacs flaunted her handsome Oriental beauty in a
sort of harvest-home dress, with sheaves of
wheat bang over the fashionable ear.
Mrs. “Bob” Power combined Bridge and
Melba as a powerful attraction on Friday even-
ing. Just a very swagger party, and Melba sang.
Mrs “Bob” is a real general. Her lions always
turn up, and they always roar. She has never
been known to fail. A rude man had a heavy bet
on the Melba card being successfully played, and
he lost badly. The diva sang and sang, perhaps
ten or a dozen songs, with delightful bird-like
abandon. “The Spring is here —the Spring is
here —and I sing” was the general tone of her
unbending. No doling out in short-cut perform-
ances.
Mrs. Stewart Balmain, lately the large and
lovely Miss Alison Fairbairn, has presented a
brand-new Balmain to the world at large. It is
of the selfish gender. Mrs. Balmain is up at a
Hill station, not far from Simla, where her lord
is with his regiment. Mamma and papa George
Fairbairn will probably fly off to see the new
grandson as soon as the House of Reps, goes into
recess.
That interesting daughter of our somewhat old
nobility, Miss Phyllis Clarke, moves quietly about
town, looking out at this new world with wide
and serious eyes. Under her comely aunt’s guid-
ance, she explores sassiety occasionally ; but for
the most part the plump little person wanders in
palpable search of inspiration. The damsel is
earnest-minded, and desires that her gold-mounted
pen may one day scrawl her into fame. Already
she has given one of her literary experiments
to a local editor, who loudly declares that he finds
much merit in it. Pa Rupert watches his offspring
in a surprised sort of way.
The French Ball —the annual ball of the Alliance
—was a gorgeous shout of the Tricolor. The ladies
of the club spent hours over the decorations them-
selves, instead of leaving the scheme to an idea-
exhausted florist. That made for originality.
An army of little red-white-and-blue sailors from
the French boat Oceanien were attached as
helpers. There’s a good deal of life in a French
dance, and it has quite a bubbling, champagny
stir about it all the time. Even the arriving
element seemed to froth and frill and billow out
of cabs and carriages in a style of its own. And
the advance down the long entrance hall ! The
Englishwomen seemed to sweep along with a long-
drawn swish of drapery—serenely, like ships in
full sail. The Frenchwomen literally danced
along with lovely frills perked at Frenehy angles
of jauntiness. Military men were much in evi-
dence to add to the gaiety of color.
Mrs. Holyrood, wife of the ex-Justice, was
there—beaming and smiling through the whole
evening. Such an energetic old lady she is—
scarcely ever misses a social function. Mrs.
Masseran and Miss Bruggmann electrified a bevy
of steward-acting boys into the most active ser-
vice, and wall-flowers were cut out of the decora-
tions.
A French girl who danced beautifully, and was
much rushed by partners, looked suprisingly like
La Sylphe. who undulates at Rickards’. Notice-
able was Mrs. Morris Mendes—beautiful, Oriental
looking, and perfectly dressed in black and white,
with a comet’s tail streaking from the dusk of
her hair. She was one of the handsome Sullivan
chicks before the wealthy confectionery Mendes
annexed her. Pretty little blue-eyed Louise
Smith chattered in French nearly all the evening.
She is a clever linguist and a devotee of the serious
literary evenings of the Alliance.
One Frenchily-coiffured madam had • horribly
expensive lily-of-the-valley in her hair (it costs
about a shilling a bud so early). Each bloom was
skewered through with wire, and looked like a
fat white lawn grub.
Rumor declares, with every appearance of
authority, that an eagerly-looked-for divorce case,
in which the star performers are all young and
sparkling, is not to be staged this season.
Whereat the good-natured friends of the trio are
much distressed. (A scandal gives such a splendid
opportunity to one’s friends to show sympathy
and say “I told you so,” or “I always thought
so ! ”) The husband who thought himself wronged
finds that the wife, if she wronged him, didn’t do
it ostentatiously. Also the supposed villain of the
piece promises to prove an alibi for every hour
spent, according to half-a-dozen highly-paid ’tecs,
in dalliance with the lady. And the husband,
remembering that a ’tec is paid to find out some-
thing, and, therefore, has to find it out or lose his
reputation for keenness, reflects, and decides that
it is better not to bring the accusation into court.
“ Tryphena ” from Paris :
A study of the French Fifi after a close acquaintance with
the English miss is instructive and amusing. Fifi is an
artiste—or a genius, rather—in her infinite capacity for
taking pains. In the adjustment of a shoe-lace, in the
tilt of her hat, in the knot of her motor-scarf, in the grip
of her waist buckle, in the crimp of her back-hair, in the
hang of her gossamer, in the great scheme of the com-
plexion, in the gleam of her ivories, in the pencilled arch
of her brow, she is the consummate genius. See her glide
into a cafb. No serpent of the Nile ever slid into notice
so fascinatingly. There’s no frou-frou about her raiment.
She rustles not, neither does she jingle. There’s a soft,
swift stealth about all her movements. She seems to be
gliding into the cafb with the wish to be unobserved.
That is her naivete. There’s a gentle look in her varn-
ished and belladonnaed eye. That also is her naivete.
There’s a severe limit to her smile—at first; that also is
her naivete. But no one is taken in for long. If Monsieur
—any Monsieur—does not materialise after the hors
d’ ceuvre or before she starts to nibble her wing of poulet,
Fifi starts a flirtation with the gargon and insists on his
being amused. Then she clatters and chirps like a canary
whose cage hangs in the rain, or a sparrow at spring bed-
time. Her teeth, her hands, her eyes, her millinery are
all factors in her animation.
Fifi is distinctly not to be encouraged. But she look*
alluringly sweet, and the hundred and one details of her
get-up put the globe-trotter under a partial spell. To sit
and watch the play of Fifi’s hands, to see her gleaming
eyes, to follow the line of pearl at her smiling, to take in
the airs and graces of her vivacity is to be fascinated into
all forgetfulness of food and drink. But it’s dangerous.
Fifi is quite equal to an audacious remark. So you wake
up and attack your turbot with gusto. And you think
on Fifi’s charm and all-conquering style, andknow why she
scores above the English miss. It is her capacity for taking-
pains over the details—the little etceteras of her toilette.
Angelina, of Merrie England, has no thought for
detail. She pays like a princess for a creation—a frock
of expression—and has it hooked and eyed on by an
attentive Hebe. Then she has her hat skewered on, and
she considers she’ll do. There’s no self-consciousness—
none of the microscopic vanities—about Angelina. She
doesn’t know in what she’s lacking. She doesn’t study
the line of her eyebrows, or the height of her ears, or
the length of her smile, or the shape of her temper.
She doesn’t look in a series of profile and back-view
mirrors for the line of figure or head from all
points of a beholder. She doesn’t weigh the
value of a darkened eyelash. She wouldn’t deign to con-
sider the seductiveness of a rouged lip. She hasn’t any
thought for the play of a lace hanky or the pinking of her
filbert nails. She doesn’t act her exits and entrances in
a hotel or cafe or theatre. She wouldn’t dream of turn-
ing to inquisitive view the better side of her countenance
(there is always a good and a bad or a medium side to the
human dial). Angelina is too proud to get up to all these
tricks. There’s no emotion in her dressing.
Women golfers are rushing the special Tourna-
ment for the sake of the permission to play at the
severely masculine Victoria Links. It’s “the
grass in the other paddock ” again, also the
distant hill that looks green, and the distant
uncle who looks affluent. The Victorias are
utterly undesirable as links go—dusty, dirty,
hard to reach. But so far they are the only ones
forbidden to women, and Eve is resolved to have
the apple or know the reason why.
Cards are fluttering out for the biggest thing in
naval and military balls. ’Tis to be on Friday
night-before-Derby, and it takes fully half-an-
hour to read the invitation card—the list of hosts
is so grandiloquent and the “to meet ” takes up
another half-dozen lines, and includes a Governor
or so, and the Admiral and other race visitors.
In fact, about 300 people invite Smith to meet
about 400 people, and Smith naturally feels as if
he were the pea that one elephant is pointing out
to another. The event is called a ball, so natu-
rally one expects dancing. But everybody gold-
laced in military and naval affairs (from every
otate) will be there. Then a solid wedge of 300'
cards go forth to Government people before the
list niters down to Smith, the mild and numerous,
ordinary blaclc-clad citizen. And it looks as if
there wouldn’t be much room for fantastic gyra-
tions and saltatory exercise.
By the time the Women’s Exhibition opens and.
bursts into bloom there will be many petals bat-
tered off by the storms. The din and clash of
battle rage round the Ex. like wild animals on a.
verandah. A few days ago the Women’s choir—
the whole 1300 of ’em—resigned in one unani-
mous top-note. The management hurriedly re-
considered the point at issue, and the 1300 white-
clad chookies fluttered back to their perch. Gentle
little Mrs. “ Prof.” Peterson, who has been going
through whirlwinds as conductor, tutoring the
choir for months back, was suddenly to be de-
posed, and Mrs. Hewett was to inherit the ebony
stick. Mrs. Hewett has written an Ode for the
choir. Mrs. Peterson gracefully suggested that
the lady should conduct her own ode, and the inch
was being stretched to so many yards that it
began to appear that there would be nothing left
for Mrs. Peterson to conduct. The lady, however,
again has the black stick in her correct white-
gloved hands.
Further, all the Tea ladies have resigned and
refused to feed the hungry herd at Our Exhibi-
tion, and now some common or garden man-
caterer is pushing his Masculinity into the Femi-
nine show. Three or so of the most swagger she-
caterers were to divide the work, and the waitresses
were to be “ quite naice ” people and the prettiest
girls in Melbourne. Now, for some reason, the
three Tea madams have sat them down suddenly,
firmly, flatly, indignantly, and the Big Order has
shattered to fragments. And the damage won’t
come out of Mary Ann’s wages either.
There was a party with a certain element of
quaintness at Bishopscourt last week. His
gaiters, Lowther Clarke, and his helpmate in-
vited the Anglican Church and its wife to meet
all the available vice-regalities who dawdle in
Melbourne for the moment. The Federal pair,
with acting-Governor Madden and his lady,
arrived early, and nobly did their duty to the
Church. It was an edifying sight to see the
mouse-like missuses of the rural clergy exchanging
ideas and observations with worthy citizens who
ordinarily confine their interests to Cup weights
and chorus lights. And the Tooraketty folk who
spent a serious afternoon among the herd of godly
black-coats, questioning them upon creche man-
agement and foreign missions—they, too, were a
delight to the cynical. Mrs. Lowther Clarke did
her duty to the archdiocese in grey silk and black
satin, while her energetic daughter moved about
in pale grey voile. Clerical wives wore modest
colors, and lay wives wore their second-best party
frocks.
The Melbourne Bicycle Club will hold its big
nieeting this year at the M.C.C. Ground ; which
is a welcome change after suffering Austral days
at the Exhibition. The club is waking up to the
necessity for new attractions, and valiantly
searches for them. It offers a prize of £lOO (more
or less) to anyone who suggests a novel feature.
It needn’t relate to a cycle whizz —it need only be
original, and the right kind of original. So far,
secretary McCullagh has received nearly 1000
letters; but never a writer in the thousand has
proposed a plan that would amuse even a babbling
infant. However, there is still a month during
which the nimble-minded may conceive and publish
a scheme worth paying for.
The Mooltan brings the Ernest Keep couple
and their bud home in time for Cup week gaieties.
Madam always may be depended upon to adorn a
festivity with her bright humor and her most
decorative figure and frillings.
The Hickman Molesworths are disposing of
their household gods, preparatory to a flight to
England. Meantime they stay at the George
Hotel. It’s improbable that they’ll return to Aus-
tralia again, except as visitors.
Last week there arrived here, unheralded and
without a brass band, a man with claims to fame.
He is Hornell, the Scawtch painter. He is a
quiet, grey notability, with a huge store of infor-
mation, a Doric burr, and an eye hungry for
fresh beauties, and he enthuses in a sane way
over the wonders of Australia. Mr. Hornell
is conspicuous as a painter of genre pictures.
Children are his pet subjects, and he shows them
as miracles of truthfulness —little men and women
whose significance and humanity are painted with
as much success as their dirt or their starchy
frills. In spite of his silent coming, the Edin-
boro’ master is being besieged by anxious artists,
eager for admiration or admonition (which he
gives with superb candor). He goes to Sydney
anon, then further afield to the real Australia
Felix.
Miss Ida Gresham had a pitiful experience last
week. Her mother, a charming old lady of much
interest, died during an afternoon. That night,
as no understudy was sufficiently prepared, the
daughter had to play her part, as a reckless lady
of bad morals, in “Why Woman Sins,” with
the Holloway co.
The Greatest Show on Earth calls itself “ Wirth
Brothers.” To my thinking, it should be “ Wirth
Brothers and Mrs. Wirth”—or something even
more prominent for the lady. Mrs. Wirth is a
young woman of much moment to that show.
She travels everywhere with it, and personally
sees to all the gay dressing. The circus will open
this month. For 16 solid weeks Mrs. Wirth has
been settled in Melbourne working like a pretty,
fair-haired tiger, with many assistants, at miles
of gorgeous dresses and tapestry. They include
not only cunning costumes for acrobats and tight-
rope walkers, and ladies who jump through
blazing rings, and maidens who ride on tigers,
but also triumphant trappings for the elephants
and proud horses and camels (the difficulty of
fitting a camel’s hump is considerable, and a
camel in slop clothes looks untidy). There is a
mighty gold-studded velvet dress for each of the
eight elephants—Topsy, Glory, Plodder, and the
rest.
Mrs. Wirth is an Englishwoman—of real Saxon
fairness. Her husband and brother-in-law are
Australians.
Princes Court is arrayed again in full armor for
the summer campaign. On Friday evening, a
Lord Mayor or so and many Importants gathered
by special invitation to see the new Roller Rink
and various other novelty shows that are to
act as sugar to the swarming summer ants. An
expert rinker cut out some fancy work on the new
floor.
Mrs. Ada Whiting is showing some exquisite
miniatures—intended for the Women’s Exhibi-
tion. The clever little artist’s most immediate
work consists of ivory miniatures of Melba and
Melba s son and Melba’s son’s wife. This im-
pressive order has just descended upon her. Mrs.
Whiting painted a miniature of Melba in Paris.
Yours affectionately, JOHANNA.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Quite the nastiest criticism Carruthers has
yet endured was offered by the Camden Park and
Waverley Onslow, in N.S.W. Assembly, last
week. Owe’Sullivan was referring in bitter tones
to the late wire-netting steal, when thus suddenly
the person of many names and tenants
It was the best thing Carruthers ever did !
For a Premier to work himself to a standstill in a
frantic attempt to hold on to office, and then to
have the identical ghastly mistake that led to his
being forced to chuck the said office blazoned, by
an alleged supporter, as the most satisfactory per-
formance of his administration, is cruel.
GRUMBLERS' CAVERN.
Mr. Irvine is one of those nondescripts who have
formed a little cave into which they invite any of the
elements of discontent to enter.—Age.
The two ways of putting it. Sydney
Evening News had to announce the other day
that Bryant and May had decided to “ erect a
large factory in Australia for the manufacture of
wax vestas, matches, etc., in consequence of the
Protective duty.” It printed that among the
puff-paragraphs about somebody’s ear-drums,
under this bald heading :
Locally Made Matches.
But it also had to announce that bottled English
beer had gone up from 11s. 3d. to 12s. per dozen ;
and that got under these headings
The Poor Man’s Beer.
Prices Gone Up in Sydney.
The Reason Why.
Another Effect of the Tariff.
And the once Protectionist Star—well, the Star
was much too busy announcing that Bill Squires
would stay in America till he could return to
Australia a winner to concern itself about such a
small thing as battling for Australian industry.
London cable :
_The priests at Ispahan, in Persia, are preaching a boy-
cott of foreign goods, and trade is at a standstill. All
the roads in the vicinity of the city are in the hands of
brigands.
It looks from that as though the Persian importer
had turned quite naturally to the other branch of
his profession.
Vic. M.L.A. Bromley has given notice of
an amendment to the Factories Bill, to the effect
that Tramway employees may have a Wages
Board if they apply for it. It is long odds that
the motion will never come to a vote in the pre-
sent Assembly; but, if it should, the division list
will be worth studying.
Bent’s thoughts must have been running
on rural subjects the other day, when a railway
deputation called on him. “Look here,” roared
the King of Victoria, when the plot had de-
veloped and things were warmed, “ I’m going to
pull those Commissioners up.” If Bent had been
a selector in his youth, he probably would have
threatened to burn them off or something like
that, but he didn’t —he said he’d pull them up,
same as vegetables at Brighton.
‘‘ Nawman ” Bayles, M.L.A. for Toorak
(Vic.), has decent impulses sometimes. While
his dreary Tory friends were opposing the exten-
sion of Wages Board possibilities to carters and
drivers, Nawman spoke up. “I’ll support it,”
quoth he ; “ there’s a paw chap leaves parcels at
mai haouse up to eleven at naight, and I think it’s
a shame that the paw beggah should have to work
so late.” Nawman’s liberal tendencies were a bit
patronising, but he got there just the same.
“In view of its inquisitorial and un-
British character,” says the Herald on the
NvS.W. Government programme, “the income
tax as a whole might, and in our present circum-
stances could, disappear with general benefit.”
Half-a-dozen lines lower in the same leader the
same Herald complains that Wade, by proposing
to only “ materially ” reduce the tax on earned
incomes, is falling back upon a British precedent.
Wade has already begun to laugh at the Herald
as a political teacher. He is un-British one
minute’ and pro-British the next. To save the
Fairfaxes from income-tax is evidently exciting
work, and makes the leader-writer dizzy.
Certain people are very mad about the
results of the Local Option vote in N.S.W., and a
great effort will probably be made toabolish the new
practice of taking the Cold Tea poll and the State
Parliamentary poll together. The new departure
had the good effect of making Local Option a live
question and gathering in a big vote. But, on
the other hand, it so filled the campaign with
beer clamor and anti-beer clamor that some poli-
ticians who were not beer clamorers could hardly
make themselves heard above the din. And
when they think of what the public lost through
not hearing them, they are sorry for the public.
All through the unsatisfactory debate in
the Reps, on the wire-netting duty the Foreign-
traders scraped away on the one string—“We
mustn’t handicap the primary producer.” They
silenced the coke industry with that gag for
years ; and in 1891 the great primary industry of
mining had to pay £4 17s. 6d. per ton for the
186,060 tons of coke it had to import. Last year,
after a duty had set the coke business on its feet,
only 6104 tons were imported, and the Australian
coke works’ average price for coke was 11s. lid.
So the duty supplied Australian works, and the
Australian works supply eight tons of coke for
what the Australian used to pay for one ton.
That is how protective duties “ handicap ” the
primary producer.
“ W.” : The worst of that Newfoundland
business (B. 3/10/’O7) is that, after promising that
nothing should be done without full
consultation with the little island, the
British Government framed the Con-
vention with Uncle Sam right over
its head. Had it not knuckled down,
Bull would probably have sent a cruiser
to enforce the agreement as against the
local laws, which have now been
“voluntarily” suspended. The calm
ignoring of Newfoundland in the nego-
tiations was abominably like the treat-
ment of Australia in the matter of the
New Hebrides. One of these days we
are likely to find Australian law being
declared from the deck of the Pa’hful,
instead of from the office of A. Deakin,
or J. C. Watson, or whoever happens
to be running this insignificant country
at the moment. The Great Power which
tumbled to its knees before the U.S. A.
over both the Jamaica and Newfound-
land incidents is just as liable to find
the dust with its stomach when some-
body else—even a Tailed somebody—
talks truculently.
G. H. Reid, on the tobacco excise
duties :
He was sorry that the young girls employed in the
cigarette factories were not engaged in making something
more useful.
Well, as far as N.S.W. is concerned, who pre-
vented the young girls in the cigarette factories
from making “something more useful”? Reid
encouraged the young girls to make cigarettes by
heavily protecting the tobacco industry ; but, at
the same time, Reid barred the young girls from
making “something more useful” by putting that
article on the free list.
Digby Denham, who ratted before the
elections because he didn’t approve of Kidston’s
socialistic tendencies, made a speech in the
Queensland Assembly the other evening. After
he had completed his remarks-in-chief, in which
he asked the Government to do a few things, he
threw in this list of odds and ends, previously
omitted : —(1) The State should assist the coffee
industry; (2) the State should actively combat
red water ; (3) the State should finance farmers to
build silos; (4) the State should eradicate prickly
pear. Then he added that Socialism was a raging
lion or a roaring elephant or a blue giraffe with a
green tail, or something, and that the State should
look with a kindly eye upon private railways.
TREADING ON HIS CORNS.
Mr. W. H Irvine, M.H.R., has made a splenetic attack on the Acting Prime Minister.... Mr. Irvine said it
was time someone trod on that gentleman’s corns, and trod on them vigorously.—Age.
Surely the whirligig of time was never
fitted with such multi-cylinder power as in New
South Wales. R. D. Meagher and John Norton
who, a few brief years ago, were carrying on hos-
tilities in the streets of Sydney, now sit side by
side in the Assembly as a “Fifth Party,” the
other four being the Ministerial, the Labor, the
O’Sullivan, and the David Storey parties. That
much-talked-of consummation —the return to the
two-party system'—seems to grow more remote
every day.
The best thing that has happened in Bris-
bane for a long while has been the flutter that the
Wages Board Bill made in the clothing factories
and dressmaking shops of the local sweaters.
They didn’t wait for the Bill to shoot; they just
came down with revised wages-sheets. Four-fifths
of them, at least, have done this. No doubt some
beautiful old Tory will note this, and announce
by-and-bye that this sort of legislation is totally
unnecessary, and in proof will point to the fact
that wages were raised before the Act was passed.
The best point made by N.S.W. Opposi-
tion-leader McGowen, the chronic loser of the
’bus, in his attack on the Wade Government, was
this extract from the manifesto issued by the
Carruthers-Wade Liberal and Deform Associa-
tion at the time when that chookey-hen gathering
was trying to shove Twaddle out of office :
His, (Waddell’s) record as Treasurer shows him to be
unfit for the position, and his Ministry to be unworthy of
trust. Electors, how can you give such a failure as Mr.
Waddell another trial ? Surely three years’ experience of
his blundering finance is quite enough for any sane man
or woman.
And now Twaddle is back at the Treasury as the
financial genius whom Wade and Carruthers have
just unearthed.
The Argus made a great discovery the
other day, and announced it this way
If the whole of the sugar consumed in the Common-
wealth last year had been imported, and had paid the
existing rate Of import duty, people would have had to
pay no more for their sugar, and the Commonwealth
would have received an additional sum of £980,000 in
sugar duties.
Likewise, of course, if Australia will import its
wheat, wool, coal, butter, newspapers, etc., etc.,
and will put a tidy import duty on those articles,
it will have to pay no more for its wheat, wool,
coal, etc., than at present, and the Commonwealth
will, moreover,, get about £10,000,000 more re-
venue. In fact, Heaven only knows why Aus-
tralia should trouble to produce anything at
all, when it can import every article of merchan-
dise, paying just as much as at present,
and get a huge Federal revenue to splash round in
addition. How it would pay for the imported
goods, and how it would pay the duty on them,
when it made nothing and bought everything
from abroad, the Argus (alas !) forgets to men-
tion. At different times the importers’ press has
set forth that it would be cheaper to shut up so
many dozen industries, and import the goods,
and even pension off the workmen, wherefore this
question is becoming urgent.
These are items from that interview with
publican Power which the Sydney Telegraph
headed with a great shriek “The Price of Beer;
Increase in Bottled Goods as a Result of the
Tariff.”
My view is that the tariff means the disuse of all im-
ported bottled beers and lagers. In this direction we will
in future consume our own products, and into the bargain
we will be able to produce some of the finest beers and
lagers in the world. An additional fact in favor of the
local product is that the New South Wales Board of
Health forbids adulteration of locally-produced beers.
As an additional result of the taxation imposed in 1901
nearly all the Scotch whisky importers have opened
branches in Victoria and New South Wales. Whisky in
bulk is sent to them, and it is thus bottled, cased, and
capsuled in Australia, while the labels are also printed
here. This means the giving of employment to hundreds
of hands, including clerical staffs and hundreds of boys
and girls.
One direct result is that the people of Australia get
five-year-old whisky out here in the wood, and the trip
through the tropics in wood, rather than bottles as for-
merly, adds three years to the maturity. The fact that
the whisky firms, too, have sent out bottling and clerical
staffs has largely assisted immigration.
In fact the yarn was a blessing upon the tariff,
but that didn’t make any difference in the head-
lines. The Telegraph doesn’t seem to worry
about making the headlines suit the matter; all
it demands is that they shall suit the importer. It
would probably head the report of a church ser-
vice “ Remarkable Dogfight ” if it thought it
could damage William Lyne by so doing.
Rhetorical flight of the Owe’Sullivan, fore-
telling the doom of N.S.W. Premier Wade :
The present Administration may blunder along for a
few months, but while looking at stars they will stumble
over pebbles—and then the ambulance will take them to
the hospital, where the grinning skulls of their prede-
cessors are stored.
Regarding the ha’penny crisis in S.
Australia :
It was Roberts, M.L.A., whose sudden change to the
other side in December, 1899, brought the Kingston
Government to grief. Now he is leading the Labor party
in its revolt against the Price Government over the
Franchise agreement arrived at with the Council.
In each instance the Franchise Bill has been the cause of
the trouble. In 1899 Kingston wanted to force a
double dissolution, and was voted out of office by
members frightened of losing-their seats. Thistime Price
has attempted to avert a double dissolution by accepting
a compromise offered by the Council, and Roberts thinks
it will pay the Labor party better “to keep the sore
open” and go to the country. One quaint reason put
forward by the revolting members of the Labor party for
refusing the £l7 franchise offered (the present franchise
is £25) is that hundreds of people are wrongfully on the
roll already, and so the number will not be greatly in-
creased by lowering- the rental qualification. In the Port
Adelaide district alone, it is said, 570 persons whose
names are on the roll do not pay the rent required by the
Constitution Act. Both sides, however, are frightened
to purge the rolls lest the names struck off should be
those of their own supporters. Under the compromise a
statutory declaration has to be taken that the person
claiming to vote, possesses the qualification stipulated,
and there is a penalty for a false declaration. It is
actually feared that under these conditions the drop in
rental value from £25 to £l7 will leave the number of
Council electors very much where it is now.
THE GREAT WADE PARROT.
Mr. Wade made some observations yesterday. “ As to
the Federal attitude,” the Premier said, “I hold very
strong views of the rights of this State as a component
part of the Federation, and that those .rights should be
observed loyally and sacredly. I have every hope that
Mr. Lyne realises that the present Government has at
heart the interests of the State in this respect, and I
trust it will occur to him that it is very desirable that
the forbearance of the State and its people should not be
further strained.”
Mrs. Hysterigraph : “ Ain’t ’e luvlyl Why,
Joe, ’e/s got your screech to th ’ life."
Ccrruthers (with pride): “Yus, Granny;
’(was I who lamed ’ im!”
From Senator Pulsford’s letter of censure
to Premier Carruthers, after the wire-netting
piracy : —
There have not been wanting those who have declared
that the Commonwealth ought to place its capital where
access to it could be obtained independent of N.S.W.
territory'. How can this argument be met if the State
employs policemen instead of the Courts to maintain its
rights against the Commonwealth ?
In other words, is it a good thing to place the
Federal Capital where one small, parochial
politician like Carruthers might at any time make
it practically a beleaguered city ? If the capital
were wholly surrounded by N.S.W. territory, that
is how matters would stand.
Dysentery is of more frequent occurrence
during the summer months. It can be checked
and cured if Chamberlain’s Colic, Cholera, and
Diarrhoea Remedy is taken. Chamberlain’s
Colic, Cholera, and Diarrhoea Remedy is in-
valuable to all medicine chests.*
GOOD COMPANY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sweating prevalent showed the need for teaching
the duty of a Christian to his neighbor. The Church
must lead. —Piece spoken at the Melbourne Diocesan
Synod (S/10/’07.)
Where Labor’s riddled banner waves triumphant in the
van,
Where march the men-at-arms who push the Brotherhood
of Man,
Where limp the broken heroes, with their anxious eyes
ashine
To see the dawn of freedom in the sweatshop and the
mine—
Hooray ! —a hurried cohort comes to share the triumph-
song,
To whack the joy and glory and the pride of righted
wrong,
A motley mob, perspiring in a frantic burst of speed—
It is the Church belated, hustling up to take the lead 1
Along the aisles of sacred piles, with knee-stools left and
right,
New Labor-leaders stride, each one a bright and shining
light,
And fierce, emphatic females, murdered fowls in every
toque,
Come dusting down to watch the Church take on poor
Labor’s yoke ;
Where once the bright tithe-sovereigns of the merchant
princes shone
Upon the plate, a cassocked army shoves the movement
on,
And out across the crimsoned fields, where still the
eagles feed,
The Church, with crumpled surplice, struggles up to
take the lead I
The river of red years has swept a thousand souls away
Who, with ten thousand foes to watch, had barely time
to pray—
That sturdy bunch of grim, unhaloed leaders, tried and
strong,
Who worked unreckoned overtime to push the Cause
along;
And now, when glory’s in the air, and Sweat’s no longer
Sin,
Fat feet in large, imported boots come boldly marching
in—
When now the pierced hands of toil have all but ceased
to bleed,
The Church waves high the banner and, applauding,
takes the lead!

A. J. O. week atoms. The £20,030 prize
money was shared by 45 owners ; £15,245 remains in
N.S.W., £2359 goes to Victoria, £1909 to Maoriland, and
£517 to (Queensland. The biggest winners were : —J.

were : —J. Burton, four wins; and I. Earnshaw, three
wins. Jockeys F. Hickey, T. Clayton, R. W. Bren-

progeny of Wallace and imported Grafton and Sir Tris-
tram each succeeded thrice.
* * * *
The second A.J.C. steeplechase was a great
tussle, and will live long- in the 1 memory of those who saw
it. A curious feature was that Marjorie was the only one
of the six starters which did not hail from Maoriland.
Haydn was favorite at 2 to 1 against, and Phaeton tis,
though crushed with 13 stone, was largely fancied by
reason of the way he won the first steeple. He came
down at the nine-furlong post, and, losing his rider, ran
the rest of the race on his own, negotiating four
jumps in great style. Haydn was leading at the
home turn, and the excitement happened when
Swimmer (5 to 1 against) caught him. Swimmer’s effort
to wipe out a dozen lengths had tired him, and Haydn’s
struggle to keep in front had just about exhausted him.
A great effort ended in Swimmer being 1 beaten by half a
length. Both horses seemed to have been ridden to a
standstill, and reeled as though they drunk. The
well-backed Eclair came a cropper at the first obstacle, a
brush fence, and though Pipi and Marjorie completed
the course they never had a hope. Marjorie was ridden by
her owner, 101 b. overweight, which was a foolish super-
fluity of ballast.
Unquestionably the great performer of the
A.J.C. meeting was the big (16‘3) Wallace youngster,
Mountain King. Through the donkey-race manner in
which the earlier stages of the Derby were run it was
impossible, despite his win, to form any opinion of his
capabilities on the strength of that performance. In the
New Stakes on the second day Mountain King did no
more than the touts and the rest of the authorities looked
for, but the gilded Craven Plate (1| mile) on Wednesday
provided a real test; and the King got through it as only
a horse of high degree could. Just as that race placed
Mountain King high in the estimation of the punters, so
did it stagger their opinion of last year’s wonder,
Poseidon. Only a point separated Poseidon and
Mountain King in the public favor, and the latter
had the call. There was heaps of gold for Antonio at 7
to 2 against, while 25 to 1 that Collarit couldn’t win went
begging. Collarit, as is his w’ont. showed the way from the
jump, with lolaire running close. Just before rounding
for home C Barit's tyre blew out, or his sparker went
wrong, or his steam fizzled away, and Mountain King and
lolaire battled bitterly to the end, where the Derby
winner got half his head —no more—in front, and struck
tile judge’s eye first. How unexpected lolaire’s
position was is made manifest, as the Scripture
sayeth, by the fact that hundreds to three against
him were available for the asking. There was not
even a suggestion of brilliance in Poseidon’s effort,
and now it is said at sporting resorts that he never
was the remarkable animal Australia considered him ; he
was the best of last year’s inferior cattle, and nothing
more. Which is plain rot. Twelve months ago Poseidon
did great things as only a thorough racehorse could.
Antonio disappointed his backers, who were numerous,
but it transpired that in addition to a gaine leg on one
side of him he had a strained shoulder on the other. He
will not appear again for some time. Possibly he will not
appear any more.

Christian Moses is at his nefarious tricks again.
Of late the punter has kept his end of the log up fairly
well, and the fact seems to worry Moses, so now he is
busy hatching schemes for the undoing of the public.
Though that £3ouo to £6O didn’t make Mooltan win the
Epsom, it is understood that the same lever will be
applied to Apologue for the Caulfield Cup. That horse’s
display in the Metrop. gives him a good look in for either
the V.A.T.C. or the V.R.C. Cups. Apologue occupies
exactly the same position with regard to the Caulfield
Cup as did Mooltan for the Epsom. He has been fancied
and backed for the Melbourne Cup just as Mooltan was
for the Metropolitan ; and just as Mooltan was not fancied
for the Epsom, neither !s Apologue thought much
of for the Caulfield, the general impression being that
he is after the bigger prize. Now it is whispered
that Christian Isaacs is holding out the tempting bait of
£5OOO to a merely nominal sum, and the offer is “being
Considered.” So those in the know are rushing to get on
to Apologue at current rates before the offer is finally
considered, when Apologue will become a shockingly
short-priced favorite. Final acceptances for the Caulfield
Cup, which have just been published, show that Apo-
logue is still in, so apparently Christian Abraham has
scored as far as is possible at this time of the year.
* * * *
Guineas day at Caulfield left the “ students of
local form ” with very little to stand upon for the Cup,
which is due on Saturday. A week earlier, nothing had
seemed more certain —as certainties go in racing—than
the claim of Subterranean to local favor. With the worst
of the weights, Subterranean ran away from the three-
year-olds—Mazarin and Master Foote —as though they
were not in the same class with him. In a subsequent
race over a like distance (10 furlongs), Yabba Gabba and
Ellis fought out a desperate finish two lengths clear of
the field, but their performance was not nearly so impres-
sive as that of the six-year-old in the earlier event. Con-
sequently, Subterranean went to a very short price for
the Cup after Poseidon had managed" to get so badly
beaten in Sydney. And punters not unnaturally rushed
to take 5 to 4 about the Maorilander for the Caulfield
Stakes on Saturday last.
But in this case he appeared to be a moderate
animal. Pitted at w.f.a. against Ebullition (in wonderful
condition) and Ellis, the favorite could only run a dead-
heat with the latter, whilst- Ebullition was winning
easily from the pair of them. And Yabba Gabba, who
ought to have been preferred to Ellis, went out
unbacked and finished nowhere. On this “form’
Ebullition (if he can stay) should beat Subter-
ranean, who (if he can stay) should be no better
than Ellis (if he can stay) in the hustle for the rich IJ-
mile race. Also Yabba Gabba should be as good as any
of them, provided that the fact of her being unbacked in
the Caulfield Stakes meant that the mare was not fancied
with an unfashionable jockey on her back. When Yabba
gave 21b. and a half-head beating to Ellis she was ridden
by the all-conquering Turner. But when Yabba received
51b. and a severe doing from Ellis a week later the jockey
was E. Stone.
In this Stakes race Bendigo was unplaced and
unbacked, although on his previous running with the
favorite the handsome offspring of Benvolio should have
been a public fancy. To this scribe’s thinking, Bendigo
is likely to prove the best of that little lot in the near
future. He seems a bit above himself, and probably he
will not be fit enough, or sufficiently well jockeyed to
win next Saturday. But, considered as a Melbourne Cup
horse, with the capacity for running on when some of the
more slippery ones are beginning to tire, Bendigo fills the
eye.
The chances are that —save Bendigo—none of
the first mentioned lot can stay. The fast 12 furlongs at
Caulfield may be too far for them. Subterranean seems
best worth backing, because he won at 10 and was a
disappointment at nine furlongs. But after looking from
all points of view at the Victorian horses that have lately
shaped bewilderingly on their native soil, one is forced to
the conclusion that something fresh from Randwick will
win the Caulfield Cup. Poseidon, Apologue, lolaire, Sub-
terranean, Bendigo, and Ebullition are the most trust-
worthy of the well-performed ones, and of the others
there is still a glamor of great possibility about
Rhubarb, an imported 6-year-old that looks just lovely,
in a ladylike way of speaking. The recent defeat of
Poseidon at Randwick suggests that he is not now, nor
ever will be again, the champion he was 12 months ago.
Still he is a quadruped of consistent excellence as com-
pared with the in-and-out performers that help to fatten
the bookmakers in Victoria. Unless last year’s winner is
more off than has been suspected, he should go near to
repeating the trick. Nevertheless, Apologue should beat
him at the weights, and lolaire at 7st. 91b. looks equally
dangerous. This prophecy, then, is—
-1 Apologue
2 lolaire
3 Poseidon

The starting at Caulfield last Saturday was bad
in two or three events. The rich Debutant Stakes, worth
£lOOO to the winner, was at the mercy of five (out of 14)
youngsters from the moment the barrier rose. The lucky
quintette changed their order of position in the running,
but from start to finish they were a long way ahead of
the other nine.

Said that the reason Poseidon showed up so
badly in the Craven Plate was that there was a collision
between him and Antonio. It put Poseidon out of the
race, and damaged Antonio’s sound shoulder, so that
that splendid horse is probably out of racing for ever.
Also alleged that Poseidon’s owner still has faith in him,
and has backed him to win a huge sum—somewhere
about £lO,OO0 —on the Caulfield Cup.

“H.R.”: Although I would not recommend
any man to raise a mortgage over the ancestral home or
pawn the family jewels to do it, the man who has money
to burn might do worse than back Tartan for Melbourne
Cup. The way he gathered up the long-distance flat
race, Randwick Plate, at the A.J.C. meeting was a
revelation. He travelled the last quarter of the 24-
miles at a pace that convinced those who watched
that he can stay as well as ever. His weight in the
Melbourne Cup is 9st. 91b., but on his form at Randwick he
can hump it. Though not quite at top form, he is near
enough to be thoroughly well on Melbourne Cup day.
Carbine, Archer, and Malua won the same event with
lOst. 51b., lOst. 21b., and 9st. 91b. respectively. Tartan
has been over the course, as he ran third to Blue Spec and
Scot Free two years ago, and the ancient dog is the
animal for the hard road. It is a bumpy race, and Tartan
is the horse for a bumpy race. Saturday’s race was
Tartan’s first win since he scooped the Plate at A.J.C.
Autumn meeting last vear.
* * * *
“Billo”: A dangerous-looking opponent of
Mountain King for the V.R.C. Derby is Master Foote,
first foal of Debutant Stakes winner Wigelmar. As a
yearling he cost the present owner, Mr. Leonard, 1600
guineas. He won Caulfield Guineas on Saturday in the
record time for the race of lmin. 41 Jsec. Still, he has not
been an unalloyed delight; he failed as a two-year-old, and
shaped poorly in the V.R.C. weight-for-age "race after he
had won at Caulfield. But his record run in the Caul-
field Guineas wipes out these matters, and as he carries
6st. 111 b. in both Cups, he has a possible for either of
them.

Adelaide Hunt Cup was this year won easily by
Vigil, a five-year-old from the “south-east” (Mount
Gambier district). Vigil shared top weight (12st. 81b.)
with Seawave, last year’s winner: started at 6 to 4
against in a field of eight, led throughout, and finished
the three miles 25 lengths to the good.

As anticipated herein, the final of the Soccer
sudden death competition between Broadmeadow and
Pyrmont for the possession of the Gardiner Cup was won
by the former, the country club, the score being three
goals to two. The game started fast, and became faster
still as it progressed. Broadmeadow drew first blood,
but Pyrmont, with a great piece of combination, managed
to equalise the scores. Thenceforward for a while both
teams played desperately, and the game swayed
about the middle of the ground, till Broadmeadow
bullocked down to Pyrmont’s goal and took shot after
shot. These goal-keeper Spencer, with amazing skill and
celerity, managed to block, till half-back Maxwell came
at him and booted it through. The first half ended with
Broadmeadow leading by two to one. The second half
started with a roar, and both teams attacked vigorously,
the leather travelling up and down the ground at a great
rate till Pyrmont scored, and made the record two all.
Time ran out without either side making any further
points, and it was decided to play to a finish, two spells
of 10 minutes each being played from opposite ends of
the ground. The end of the first spell found the
teams still equal, and half-way through the
second one. they were still struggling, without having
scored. Then Broadmeadow back, Doyle, kicked a goal
amidst tremendous applause. The Pyrmont men made
frantic efforts to equalise the score. Broadmeadow
struggled as hard to make its victory even more decisive.
The light began to fail, but they toiled on through
the twilight and deepening gloom, and the murk in the
hearts of the Pyrmont men was darker than the field on
which the ball became gradually undistinguishable. It
was dark when Broadmeadow, breathless and gasping,
marched off the field winners by three goals to two, and
owner of the Gardiner Cup.

On Saturday last a hard nor’-easter swept over
Sydney Harbor, and hands that during the winter rest
had lost their cunning in the management of the canvas,
brought trouble on their owners’ heads. The chief event
was the opening handicap of the Sydney Sailing Club.
Making for the starting line the Mona came to grief and
gave warning that it was a day of danger. At Steel Point
the Wonga capsized ; but the crowning disaster was that
of the Zena, which upset just after rounding the buoy at
Clark Island. The steamer Bingarra, on its way to
Manly, was steering to cross the stern of the Zena when
the boat turned over. This brought the little craft right
in front of the Manly steamer, and the Bingarra’s engines
immediately went astern, or not a man on board the
overturned craft would haye escaped. Two of the Zena’s
crew dived clear of the oncoming steamer, but the suc-
tion of the screw appears to have drawn the others under.
The Watson’s Bay boat and the Lady Ariel launch came
in to render assistance, but the men were rolled about
like sticks in the heavy wash, and life buoys
were thrown around in wild profusion. Eight of the
nine men on board the Zena were saved, the owner (J. M.
Firth) being in an unconscious state. One man (Edgar
Woods) was just reaching for a rope when he disappeared
under the steamer and was not seen afterwards. At time
of writing, the body had not been recovered. Two naval
men sailing round Garden Island were capsized, and one
was drowned. The pilot steamer was coming past
Chowder Bay when the skipper heard cries in the dark-
ness, and, proceeding to investigate, found five men
clinging to an upturned boat. They had been there an
hour.
Tho smash-up of the Zena and the death of
Edgar Woods took all interest out of the race. When
Zena went over, Crescent was seconds ahead of Scot,
which was about as much in front of Pheasant, with Aus-
tralian and Eileen bringing up the rear, Donelly having
retired. At Taylor Bay Orescent was 56sec. ahead, and
the other positions unchanged. Crossing the stream
Scot drew alongside Crescent, and then the mast sprung,
putting the boat out of the race. Pheasant sustained a
similar injury ; and Crescent flew on to win with ease
and a margin of lmin. 29sec. from Australia, while the
damaged Scot was third, and Pheasant fourth.
« * ■* *
N.S.W. Rowing Association’s Championship
Regatta was held on the upper reaches of the Parra-
matta River. The interest centred in the Champion
Eights, and the Sydney Club was the defender. Leich-
hardt, University and Mercantile clubs were the attack-
ing force. Mercantile got away with a beautiful start,
but Leichhardt and University came with a mighty
swing, and the champion boat, through bad
steering, began to fall behind. At the mile
Leichhardt was leading University, and Sydney
was leading Mercantile, which showed signs of weaken-
ing. At Gascoigne Bay UniversiT '■ challenged Leich-
hardt, and they both left Sydney behind by about
half a length. Then the Sydney captain was heard
shouting, his men began to move, and the old boat went
leaping through the water. Stroke by stroke it climbed
up alongside the struggling leaders, ran level with
them, and then drew away amidst wild applause. But
Leichhardt came again, and ran level with the champion
crew for a little way, University being a length and a
half behind, and Mercantile away to glory in the rear.
Another spurt sent Sydney to the front, and the crowd
was already cheering the winners when faulty steering
gave Leichhardt and University another chance. They
snapped it. All in a flash they were alongside, but Syd-
ney made a supreme effort, and just managed to swing to
the front as the winning line was crossed.

The popular fallacy that sharks do not venture
into surf received another damaging knock at Merewether
Beach, near Newcastle, Sunday morning. Edward Nolan,
diving out to meet an incoming roller, suddenly found
himself face to face with a shark, which dived under him,
turned on its side and grabbed his arm. He managed to
wrench the limb away, and make for the shore. His
friends rushed into the water to his assistance, and the
shark, scared by the fuss, made off. What between
sharks, undertow, backwash and dress ordinances, the
surf bather has a harried time.
* * * *
Something like a rebellion is pending in Sydney,
but the subject is not State Frights, wire netting or the
capital question. It is bathing costume. Mayor Watkins,
of Waverley, and practically every other waterside
mayor, have ukased that men who bathe shall wear
skirts, and sun bathing on the beaches is to be strictly
prohibited. The bather shall undress and don his bathing
costume in the place provided for the purpose, then make
a bee-line at a dog-trot to the water, When he or she
emerges from the water, he or she or it shall make a bee-
line at a dog-trot for the dressing-box, speaking to
no one on the way, This is imperative. The dress
is to consist of a tunic and trunks reaching from
the shoulder to the knee, and fastened round the waist
and descending to the knees a kilt, kirtle, skirt
draggle-tail, or embankment. Samples are on view
at all the suburban town halls, where intending
bathers may see and take patterns. The question
of fencing in certain portions of the beaches for
sun-bathing purposes is being considered, but at present
Mayor Watkins and other big dogs are of opinion that
sun bathing should be confined to the back yard. The
trouble is that the average back yard in a Sydney suburb
is about as public a place as any beach.
* * « *
What resembled, as far as the spectators were
concerned, a dress rehearsal of the “Australian Henley”
transpired on the Yarra last Saturday, when the question
which public school was entitled to call itself “ head of
the river” for the year was decided. There were
five entries —Melbourne Grammar, Scotch College,
Wesley Grammar, Xavier College, and Geelong
Grammar; and as Melbourne’s boss trickle only
accommodates three competitors at once, the preliminary
heats had been decided the day before. Geelong had
then won by a third of a length from Wesley. Melbourne
Grammar looked to be winning, when No. 5 caught a
crab and upset the whole combination. Scotch College
had beaten Xavier handily. The Geelong lads averaged
list., and when they met Scotch (who averaged list.
lOJlb.) on Saturday, the weight and length of reach told.
Scotch collared a lead at the start, and increased it
steadily, and though the lighter eight made a
strenuous spurt at three-quarter distance they couldn’t
reduce the lead, and finished, dead beat, 2J lengths to
the bad. This is Scotch College’s first appearance as Boss
of the River, Wesley College having held that proud
position since the race was inaugurated as an eight-oar
scramble in 1901.

The remarkable feature of Sydney cricket last
week was the evenness of the scores. Redfern and
Paddington tied ; Waverley beat University by only 12
runs on the first innings ; Glebe walloped Petersham by
five runs on the same basis ; Central Cumberland smashed
up Burwood by 80, also on the first innings ; and North
Sydney downed Gordon by 52 (first innings likewise). The
only big defeats of the week were those of Balmain and
Sydney. Callan Park scrunched the former by eight
wickets, and Middle Harbor accounted for Sydney by
four wickets and two disputed runs.
• * * *
The only century-maker was Hickson, of
Gordon, who smacked up 113 against North Sydney
before Clarke bowled him. Other good scores were
Bardsley’s 91 against Petersham, while A. E. Johnston
made 84 for Burwood against Central Cumberland, and
then went down to a straight one from Cranney.
The result of the upheaval was to place North
Sydney at the head of the competition with five points,
the nearest rivals being Central Cumberland and
Waverley, which are dead level in second place with twm
points each. The rest nowhere.
* * * »
The argument between the V.C.A. and the
M.C.C. as to the sum to be paid for using the Melbourne
Cricket Ground for two “test” matches and two Eng-
land v. Victoria matches is still proceeding. The club
sticks to its demand of 15 per cent, of the gross takings—
plus, of course, free entry for its members and their lady
friends. The Cricket Association has sprung its first
offer of 5 per cent, to a sort of sliding scale covering 5 per
cent, if the gross takings are less than £7OOO, 7J per cent,
if they are between £7OOO and £9OOO ; 10 per cent, if
between £9OOO and £lO,OOO, and 15 per cent, if over that
sum. The M.C.C. points chirpily to the 15 per
cent, guaranteed in Adelaide and the 18 per cent, in
Sydney. But the cases are not on the same footing. All
the profits at Adelaide go to the S.A. Association, while
in Sydney the Board of Control deals with the ground
trustees direct, and, not having such a huge mob of club
deadheads to cater for, has a larger percentage of paying
public to levy on. The point that the M.C.C. seems to
have overlooked is that it is demanding 15 per cent, of
the gross receipts for the use of a ground that doesn’t
belong to it at all. The Marylebone C.C. gets 50 per cent,
of the gross receipts, and if the Melb. C.C. is to get 15 per
cent, there will be a poor little 35 per cent, with which
the Board of Control can pay expenses amounting to
some £2OOO, and face any other contingencies—including
the £lO,OOO guarantee—that may occur, besides doing all
the graft and taking all the risk. At latest the ground
trustees had asked club and association to appoint three
delegates each, to talk matters over with them before the
modus vivendi gets fractured beyond repair, in a manner
of speaking.

The League of Victorian Wheelmen decided
that Dobie, winner of the Warrnambool to Melbourne road
race, was not paced by motor cyclists, and that the real
caitiff in the case was one named Halit, who has been de-
prived of his prize and passed out for 12 months. Two days
before the Warrnambool-Melbourne race was run the
Dunlop people discovered tacks on a section of the track.
Having traced the alleged offender the Dunlop folk are
talking legal action.

That cablegram from Macfarland, Pye, and
Clarke which arrived from Suva, requesting that they be
entered for the sports on Eight Hour Day, created con-
siderable surprise.- These cyclists are changing 1 their
habits. Time was when Mac wouldn’t.go across the road
unless the fact was extensively advertised and properly
boomed. In spite of his remarkable running, and all the
rest of it, one can’t help feeling good towards Macfarland
He was such a manty sort of humbug 1 , and when he had
made his tale he stuck to it with a determination that
was as admirable as it was exasperating. He is thorough
in his hatred of niggers, and when the League had rubbed
it into him Mac chewed a straw philosophically till
Mclntosh, of the League, was leaving the room. Outside,
the long Mac touched the short one on the shoulder, and
a Yankee twang smote the stars : “ Sa-a-a-y, Mac, by the
time y’ know as much about niggers as I do, you’ll like
the black sons of dogs about as much as I do.” And then
he spat with great emphasis.

Major Taylor’s Christianity was a heavy han-
dicap when he was hustling on the track. When it came
to finesse on board of a bike there wasn’t a man on the
Australian tracks who could hold a candle to him.
But he slid he always felt the foot of de Loard
beside his own, driving the pedal, an’ he couldn't
use the foot of de Loard in bad work. “Well,
get the Loard to bog into it on his own ! ” said one
impious jigger. And that night the Loard did.
MacFarland was trying to bustle Taylor. He used to
trade on Taylor’s respect for the Loard’s foot. But just
for once he miscalculated. The black man gave a waggle,
his machine made an almost invisible side swing, and
next moment most of the spokes were ripped out of
Mac’s wheel, and that lengthy wheeler, cursing magnifi-
cently, was compelled to run off on to the grass, while
Taylor, with a sardonic smile, flew on and won his heat.
MacFarland’s respect for Taylor increased about 500 per
cent, on account of that little caper, and he always spoke
of it in terms of profound admiration.

The supporters of N.S.W. sculler Richard Tres-
Idder are not altogether satisfied with the articles signed
and sent over by Webb and his backers. The papers said
nothing about expenses, and were silent as to the division
of the steamer takings, and so that there may be no mis-
understandings on these most important matters, Webb's
manager is to be written to. In the meantime canvassers
are to be appointed to try to rake in the remaining £250
of the£sooistake. So far Newcastle district has provided all
the monev promised, and as the championship is an nll-
Australian matter, it certainly does seem unfair that
Newcastle should have to find the whole of the boodle.
What has gone wrong with N.S.W., anyhow, when a
recognised sculler has to practically beg the stake to en-
title him to try to bring the championship back to
N.S.W. and Australia?

On of about January 13 next, 26 champion
bowling Goliaths will leave Maoriland for N.S.W., with a
View to repeating the severe hiding the same crowd last
year inflicted on the Cornstalk bowlers. The Rugby
infatuation has not spread to the bowlers of Maoriland,
and the invading force will wear not one suggestion of
black about it, and will be known as “ The All White ’*
team. At the same time N.S.W. will probably send a
team to Tasmania. The first contest of the new Season
will be that for the John Young shield, which will be held
by the winning team for one year, and then put up for
another struggle. The contest will be open to all clubs,
and will be a sudden-death affair. The whole of the
games will be played on one day, and the club that wins
by the biggest margin of points is to take the shield.

Dick Kernick and Tom Fennessey, the two
heftiest “boys” available, were staged in a 20-round
battle at Melbourne Pavilion the other Monday evening.
Kernick is well up towards 40, and Fennessey is a bald
boxer of 38 or so, but boxers are “boys” and “lads” as
long as they are not so old as to be in the second
perambulator stage. This fight was not exactly a
scientific object lesson, but it contained avast amount of
stoush, most of which fell on the somewhat piratical
countenance of Mr. Kernick, who, at the finish, had an
ear like an uncooked shoulder of lamb, and a crumpled
nose, not to mention other facial injuries necessi-
tating an unceremonious call at the hospital next
door. Kernick was badly beaten, Fennessey winning at
least 16 out of the 20 rounds ; but when the small, fierce
referee yelled : “ Kernick the winner ! ” nobody was sur-
prised—the crowd hooted from force of habit, but it felt
no astonishment. Patrons have become used to these
quaint eccentricities on the part of referees in Melbourne.
Until boxing encounters can be refereed by a machine,
the issue of battles should be decided by shaking the
competitors’ names in a hat. This would leave a great
deal to chance, but chance is more reliable than the
average referee.

It is whispered, but not officially confirmed,
that Mort’s Dock Co. will build that Austral champion
boat just as soon as manager Relph can get his workshops
properly going. Just at present that energetic young
man is experiencing all the difficulties that attach to the
building up of a new industry in a young country. The
construction of internal combustion motors is an art in
itself, and the management is hard at work organising a
staff to keep pace with the orders that are pouring in
under the new tariff. Over 100 men are already employed.
When this expanding business has found its limitations, it
is understood, although not officially announced, that the
big Dock will put its ears right back and seriously lay
itself out to produce the star boat of the southern seas.
Writer suggests that it should be built of phosphor bronze
and driven by a couple of motors of 200 h.p. each. A
boat like that would take some beating.
A STEWARDESS
Regards Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills as a
Splendid Remedy for Headaches and
Sciatica.
Mrs. Rankin,
who has some
time since retired
from the service
of the A.U.S.N.
Co., Ltd., in
whose steamers
she was so well
and favourably
known, says in
her letter that
she has found no
better remedy for
headaches and
sciatica than Dr.
Morse’s Indian
Root Pills, and
she has no hesita-
tion in recom-
mending them as
a splendid medi-
cine:—“ll4 Kent Street, Sydney.—Dear Sirs, —
As one who has used Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills for many years, I. can conscientiously say
that I have found no better remedy for headaches
and sciatica. For many years I was stewardess
in the employ of the A.U.S.N. Co., and I always
carried a bottle of your pills with me, and I in-
variably found them as satisfactory with other
people as with myself. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills are a splendid medicine, and I have no
hesitation in recommending them.” To those
who travel, Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills should
be a constant companion, carried in the pocket or
handy in the portmanteau. Especially to those
journeying by sea are these pills invaiuaVle. A
day or two before sailing the bowels should be
well regulated, and on board ship a pill or two
taken each night will in nine cases out of ten
prevent seasickness, as it is invariably the
constipated condition of the bowels which precipi
tates that distressing complaint.*

By The Bulletin’s Oldest Inhabitant: —
George Stevenson, who died, aged 76, at Malvern (Vie.),
on Sunday, was one of the pioneers of the softgoods trade
in Melbourne. Stevenson, sen., was in extensive business
in Manchester, and had trade connections with Van
Diemen’s Land. In 1846 he sent his eldest son, Leander Cox
Stevenson, to look after those interests. In 1851 George
left for Australia in the Roman'Emperor, arriving in 1852.
In 1853 a branch was established in Melbourne. In 1859,
George went to England, married, and returned to
Melbourne, where he decided upon settling. He became a
noted personage in the early tariff struggles of over 40
years ago. A discharged clerk, in 1876, charged George
with having forwarded to him from England two sets of
invoices, one indicating the true value of goods
imported, the other faked for presentation to the
Customs officer. Collector of Customs Guthrie attempted
a siege of the warehouse of Stevenson, backed up by a
strong army of assistants. The Stevensons resisted,
violence was resorted to on both sides, and the affair
occupied the law courts for some time. It was thought then
that the firm intended to sue the Government for im-
mense damages, but after much waste of good Costs the
matter dropped.
“Weka”: The Ward Government (Maori-
land) has struck trouble again, and it is a noisy
sort of worry. J. A. McCullough, a union leader
in Canterbury, made remarks about the Ministry
which might have galvanised a heap of moi
bones into action. Somebody remembered that
McCullough was a tinsmith at the Government
workshops when he wasn’t cursing the Ministry.
McCullough ceased to be a tinsmith at the
Government workshops, which was a mighty
foolish thing on the part of whoever was re-
sponsible ; the wise thing would have been to make
him two tinsmiths, or else a foreman. Then the
Trades and Labor councils, which had been spoiling
for a fight, called mass meetings and set the grass
on fire with their language. Nothing really ensued,
but a growing tendency on the part of a certain
section of erstwhile followers to bark at the
Government grows very noticeable.

Died in Adelaide, suddenly, Andrew Scott,
Prominent educationalist. He was one of
Hartley’s young men ” years ago, and had
latterly been head of the Training College for
fetate-sehool teachers. Scott was a great golfer,
amateur photographer, and church organist; but
™ s pleasantest recollection was that he bowled
w. (Jr . Grace with his second ball when W.G.G.
was in his prime in 1874.
An old identity of St. Arnaud (Vic.), Mrs.
Elizabeth Gormley, died recently. She was a
sister of the late Patrick Jennings, who was in
business at St. Arnaud in the early ’fifties, and
subsequently moved to N. S. Wales, entered poli-
tical life, and became a kind of Premier. He was
the founder of the town of St. Arnaud, and was
chairman of its first municipal council. Mrs.
Gormley was twice married, her first husband
being John Quigley, of Castleblaney, Ireland.
Following his advocacy of Protection for
Mort’s Dock (Balmain), Wilks, the alleged Free-
trade member, shamelessly and openly advocated
a duty of 15 per cent, on wire netting, Lysaght’s
wire-netting factory being in his electorate. So
Wilks is again in the position of the man who
says Protection is disastrous, yet demands
all of the disaster he can get for his own electorate
also the man who says that Protection is a
mighty good thing for Balmain, yet rages when it
is proposed for Bathurst or Ballarat. Wilks is
parochialism incarnate. He isn’t parish-minded
in the N.S.W. sense, nor in the Sydney sense.
Balmain is a big enough parish for Wilks’ mind.

“Reka,” from Maoriland :
“Experiences?” said the little dentist. He surveyed
the big dint in the gas-tank reminiscently. “ A man
from the backbloeks did that,” he said. “ Regular giant
he was. He’d had toothache for a week, so he tramped
eight miles through the bush, came 60 miles by train, and
walked in here one afternoon about four o’clock. I gave
him gas, and was just ready to begin, when suddenly up
shot his feet in the air, and the next second he was stand-
ing behind the chair, facing me. Then he flung one arm
through a window-pane, and rushed at me. Catch him ?
No ! I dodged him. Took the lamp, and got out of the
room, and waited for him to eome-to. He couldn’t do
himself much harm, and he could easily have killed me.
He smashed another pane, and kicked the tank into the
shape of an old jam-tin before he quieted down. When I
ventured in I found him sitting in the chair. “ Say,
boss,” he said, “ that darned thing’s stopped achin’ now.
I guess I won’t have it out to-day. Whatever yer been
doin’ to th’ room ?”
I had a queer experience once with a girl of about 12.
I put the cap over her mouth, she took one breath, and
then suddenly she slid with a curious, sinuous wriggle on
to the floor. I grabbed her and called for assistance, and
four of us held her. She fought like a young demon.
When she came round her sister said, “It’s no use.
She’ll just have to have it out without gas or have the
toothache. You’re the fifth dentist that’s tried to give
her gas to-day.” About five years after, a girl walked
in one day and asked to have a tooth out. I took charge
of her, and began to give the gas. She took one breath,
and began to slide down with an odd hut familiar motion.
Suddenly I recognised the wriggle, and snatched the cap
awaj-. We’d hard work to hold her then. I asked her
not to come a third time.
When I first began to practise I used to travel all over
the North. Once at Whangarei an old lady asked me to
go to_ her house and pull one of her teeth. We gave
laughing gas in those days, and it had a most exhilara-
ting effect on some people. My old lady arose and danced
a wild liaka, and then commenced throwing- the orna-
ments at me. I was hit on the nose by a china pug, and
dodged two gilt shepherdesses and the parlor clock. She
wasn’t a bad shot for a woman, and I’d quick work
dodging. Suddenly she dived into the bedroom and
seized a revolver she always kept loaded in case of bur-
glars. I left by the back door. From behind a lemon tree
I saw jugs, cups, plates, and sundries dashing through
the window-panes, and there was a hideous riot of
breaking crockery going on inside. Presently I crept in
and got the revolver, and she began to slow down. She
cried bitterly when she catne-to and saw the havoc
around, and said I must have knocked her about and ill-
treated her shamefully.
Maoriland has discovered that 25 per cent,
adval will not keep out the cheap paper foot-
gear. Boots are invoiced to the Dominion at
from 2s. (duty 6d.) to 4s. (duty Is.) a pair, and
sold for 7s. They pay the shopkeeper hand-
somelv, for at the first touch of water they fall to
pieces, ana the owners come back for more. The
cheap imported boot means large profits and
quick returns, and therefore is beloved by the
huckster. But it does not pay Maoriland, which
finds that since 1901 the number of people
employed in making boots has decreased by 490,
in spite of the increasing population. The wages
earned by the operative have also decreased. As
to the remedy—well, how about a duty of ss. per
pair?


Australasian
Interstate Mail
Steamship Lines
HE last of the Five Com-
panies is the Mcllwraith,
McEacharn and Co. Pro-
prietary Ltd., which took
its place in Australian
coastal mercantile marine
about 20 years ago, and has done its share in
the building up of our Commonwealth. Its
colliers carry coal from Newcastle all along the
Australian coast to far-away Westralian ports, and
its general cargo and passenger steamers run from
Sydney about once a fortnight over the same water.
Its fleet consists of nine steamers and two tugs, and
in addition to the services mentioned above the co.
regularly runs a steamer to Calcutta. The fleet con-
sists of the following steamers: Ashridge (2884),
Cooeyanna (3922), Coolgardie(2s42), Kalgoorlie (2981),
Komura (2112), Kooringa (3174), New Guinea (2674),
Noorkoowa (1643), Kooyong (2000). The tenders
Torrens and Zephyr make up the tail of this fine fleet.
Very few Australians have any idea of the con-
veniences and facilities they are provided with by the
Five Companies. No country in the world is better
served by its coastal marine than Australia, and
mighty few of them nearly as well. During the 87
days between July 3rd and September 28th, for
instance, the Five Companies despatched from
Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide for the Westralian
ports 26 steamers, which is, roughly, one first-class
boat every three-and-a-half days. From Albany they
despatched 13 steamers for the and the same
number for the east. Passengers from Fremantle
had the services of 19 steamers to take them east
during the same period. Then there are 17 steamers
in the Queensland service, which follow one another
at about two days intervals. Twice a week steamers
run to Maoriland, and once a week the eager tourist
can pack his gripsack and start for Tasmania. In
addition to all these, there are various Island
services which there is no space to mention
just now.
And the Australian public gets an added
advantage from the number of steamers
which is not enjoyed by
the dweller in other
. parts, where the
various proprie-
taries are in
cut throat op-
position.
With a
whole con-
tinent to
work up-
on, and a
trade that
is increas-
ing’ every
week and month, the Five Companies find that
they are able to better accommodate the travel-
ling public and still conserve their own indivi-
dual interests by making their tickets inter-
changeable, so that the man whose business or
pleasure make it necessary for him to break his journey
at some port, has not to waste days or weeks for a
steamer of the same company to come along before
he can continue his journey. No sooner is one
steamer hull down over the horizon than another
funnel, bearing the colors of one of the Five Com-
panies, rises above the opposite sky line, to
be followed by a third whpn that has dis-
appeared ; and on any one of them he will receive
the same attention, the same fine accommodation,
and the fact that he is travelling on another pro-
prietary’s ticket will not count unto him for un-
righteousness, because someone else is most assuredly
returning the compliment on another boat of the other
lines. And yet, in spite of this working agreement,
the internal competition is never relaxed. Every
time one of the Five Companies makes an improve-
ment, or gets outabigger and better steamer, the others
are forced to follow suit, or else the public will fasten
on to the line that has the most floating palaces, and
firmly but politely decline to “interchange,” no
matter how alluring the prospect may be.'
This page concludes the historical and statistical
account of the rise and growth of the Five Companies.
After this the space will be devoted to letting the
public know something of the interesting places to
which these fine steamers trade, and give some
account of the steamers themselves, each of which has
its interesting episodes. With a strict regard to
truth, of course, there may be occasional accounts of
the weird things that have been seen from the bridges
in the starry silences of the night, and more occasion-
ally descriptions of the awful things seen in the
smoking saloons, so that he who reads may run.
There is a whole fund of romance around the steamers
that make up the endless chain that holds the Six
States together, and, as far as space will allow, it will
be placed at the disposal of readers. The inner life
of the Australian coastal marine has yet to be written,
and when it is it will fill many interesting volumes.
Shipping statistics are hard to get, and never up-to-
date when they are obtained. From the last issue of
“A Statistical Accountof Australia and New Zealand,
1903-4,” we learn that the total value of Australian
shipping was, at the end of 1903, £6,359,000, and that
of Maoriland £1,944,000. And the bulk of that
6-2 millions is represented by the steamers belonging
to the Five Companies, and, further, it has grown
largely between the end of 1903 and October, 1907.
But the value of its coastal marine to Australia is
not gauged by the actual money value of the ships.
It is the work they make and the means they supply
of turning the produce of the earth into wealth. They
make railways to seaports profitable, they suppl}’’ a
market for the coal of a hundred mines, and give
work to an army of men who drive carts and
handle goods on wharves. When the Westralian
Goldfields broke out, the ships of the Five Com-
panies, without fuss or ostentation, transported a
bigger crowd of people as passengers who had
to be decently accommodated and properly provided
for than did the British Government when the
South African war called for what the world described
“a gigantic effort.” The soldier was bundled on
board auyhow, and had to be content with what he
got. The gold miner was a free man, and an un-
usually independent one, who liked his money’s
worth ; and no one ever heard him complain that he
did not get it on the steamers of the Five Companies.
But great as have been the accomplishments of
the Five Companies in the past, the signs are that
they will be called upon shortly to make an even
greater effort. Of the 7750 miles of Australian coast-
line, that huge gap from Thursday Island, on the
North-east to Geraldton on the west is a blank. The
Australian coastal marine does not plough up those
thousands of miles of water. But Australia is enter-
ing on a new chapter of history, and now the shout is
to fill up the empty North and erect a white barrier
against the possible overflow of Asia. The Northern
Territory is rich in minerals, has a magnificent
climate, and can grow everything that a white man
requires. All the navigable rivers the continent
possesses are there, and the place contains enormous
possibilities. There is talk of building a transcon-
tinental railway, and that it will be of pre-eminent ser-
vice from a national and strategic standpoint is indis-
putable. But the settlement of the empty North when
it begins in deadly earnest will fall on the shoulders
of the men who manage the Five Companies, as did
the rush to Coolgardie and Pilbarra. For the railway
will take years to build, and, when it has been con-
structed, it will be a more expensive method of
travelling than by the sea. The ocean waves cost
nothing to maintain. If the Australian Government
wants to set to work to make a new State in the
Northern Territory, there is no reason why it should
not commence immediately. The shipping companies
that have built up Queensland, Victoria, the Golden
West, and made South Australia part of the Com-
monwealth, are quite capable of making the Northern
Territory if the Government will devise some method
of inducing people to settle there.
There was a time when the traveller who loved to
revel in luxury used to travel round the Australian
coast in the English mail steamers, but it is a dead
day now that the Five Companies have commenced
to run great 7000-ton twin-screw liners like the
Kauowna and Kyarra, fitted with magnifi-
cent deck-cabins and commanded by
officers who have spent all their
lives navigating the coast of their
own land. The traveller to-
day, by sticking to the
ships of his own country,
has just as great
luxury on one of the
big liners belong-
ing to the Five
Companies, with
the added advant-
age of being able
to break his jour-
ney anywhere, and
continue hi s trip by
the first steamer
that comes along.
Under these cir-
cumstances, he
naturally prefers
the Australian ships.

Pins put through holes in iron frame into
a WOODEN PLANK, which, sooner or
later, must give way. In a space of 1| square
feet, 216 pins, each l|in. x jin., are driven.
Timber cannot resist such honeycombing
under a strain of 20 tons. The holes become
oval, as shown above, by the crushing of the
wood fibres.
European and American piano-makers have for generations sought after a simple and practical metal tuning-
system (vide Edgar Brinsmead, of John Brinsmead and Sons, and Julius Bluthner, Leipsic); but though various devices
have been patented almost every week, the Beale-Vader Patent Steel Tuning-System is the only metal tuning-system in
practical use. More than 9000 Beale Australian Pianos are now in use throughout Australasia, and are giving
universal satisfaction.
In addition to the above patent we have originated many other improvements in piano-construction—a system of
building the cabinet-work which assures absolute immunity from warping or splitting; a sounding-board which gives a
softness and sweetness of tone unapproached by any other piano (as vouched for by Herr Emil Greder, Miss Sara
Anderson, and Herr Karl Studemund, of Musgrove’s Royal Grand Opera Company); a hexagonal steel core for the copper*
wound strings in the bass, securing a firm hold for the copper on the steel; hitch-pins cast in the iron frame, instead of
laboriously drilling holes and inserting the pins—thus effecting a saving in cost, while improving the efficiency; and many
other details of minor importance, to instance one of which we mention a hinge for the lid of grand pianos which allows of
a moulding on all sides, whereas all foreign pianos have one side of the lid without moulding, due to the construction
of their hinges.
We do not neglect the lessons and experience of the old-world makers ; in fact, inasmuch as we hold the only
patents registered in Australia for pianos, we can and do use all the best points of foreign pianos, with the added improve-
ments above mentioned. The same energy and the same ability, inventive and directive, which have effected these
important improvements where older manufacturers have failed, are used throughout in the construction of the Beale
Australian Pianos, and the result is that the people of Australia can buy pianos made here by their own countrymen far
superior to any they can import. We invite you to compare our pianos with the best imported instruments, and you must
acknowledge that the Beale Australian Pianos are unequalled.

‘‘My face and nose were in a very bad
state through indigestion. After trying
many kinds of soaps and ointments,
my doctor recommended me to try
Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment.
I did so about three years ago, with
the most satisfactory results, and since
then I would not be without them. I
could not get washed with any kind
of soap until I tried the Cuticura Soap,
but with Cuticura Soap and Cuticura
Ointment my face soon got better. I
only used one box of the Ointment.
I recommended Mrs. K —, of the S —•

They cured her entirely in a very short

The Inky Way.
The new Wellington (Maoriland) daily, the Dominion,
explains its policy thus : “ Great questions are agitating-,
and will continue to agitate, the public mind. Our view of
those questions is decided, not by the strategic require-
ments of any established party, or vested interest, but by
the natural requirements of the whole public. Our
policy, to meet that view, will necessarily mean the
acceleration of this existing tendency and the retardation
of that—in brief, a broad policy, free from narrowness or
exclusiveness in any direction. It will look, not to the
effecting of temporary ends, but to the securing of valu-
able permanences.” The Dominion makes rather a dull
beginning with the announcement tliat it has “ a broad
policy free from narrowness.” And to all appearance it
is going to be run on Fat principles free from leanness,
and its ideas will either be high and free from lowness or
tall and without shortness.
* * » a
The modern serial is no class unless it lias the day
before yesterday’s biggest sensation as a central feature.
The Weekly Dispatch (London and Manchester) has pub-
lished numerous chapters of “ Evelyn : The Tragic Life
Story of a Beautiful Artists’ Model,” which lifts slabs of
character and incident from the Thaw murder case.
Leading persons in the story are “Herbert Yarde, an
eccentric millionaire ”; “ Evelyn, his wife, formerly
actress and artists’model ” ; and “ Stafford Nation, mil-
lionaire and pleasure-seeker, who is madly infatuated
with Evelyn.” The yarn is keeping just a few feet behind
the real case, and seems to be treading water (or gore), in
the hope that some more revelations will soon arrive
to be turned into “ literature.”
• * * *
“ St. Andrew’s University ” writes : Have been in and
around the Dominion for nearly five years trying to make
an honest living by writing, principally for English and
American journals. Occasionally, until I discovered
where I was, I offered MSS. to Maoriland newspapers,
and, with the sole exception of the Evening Post,
Wellington, they received those epoch-making contri-
butions of mine with considerable disrespect. In some
cases they were neither acknowledged, returned, nor
printed. But, strange to say, the same Maoriland papers
have all along displayed wonderful readiness to appro-
priate my work after it has been published—and paid
for—by the best class of London journals. I once des-
patched on the same day a short article.to the Pall Mall
Gazette, and another to the editor of an Auckland
weekly. That sent to Auckland I have never seen or
heard of since. Had it been printed, the uncongenial
duty of paying for it would have had to be faced. There-
fore it was not printed. But the other article had a
cordial welcome in the same office. Published in the
Pall Mall Gazette, it was abstracted by the said Auck-
land weekly, which inserted it as an original contribu-
tion —no indication was given that it had been
boldly scissored out of the big London daily. Another
illustration : An article of mine entitled, by the -way,
“ The Rim of the Antarctic ” appeared not long ago, also
in the Pall Mall Gazette. This was taken over holus
bolus by, at least, five Maoriland newspapers. Two
acknowledged that it had seen the light elsewhere ; three
pretended that it had been specially written for their
pages. One of the latter —an Auckland daily—two weeks
ago revealed its weak and immoral methods. A para-
graph appeared in its news columns setting forth that
the Auckland paper containing my article (stolen from
the Pall Mall) had been forwarded by a correspondent
to a newspaper in Glasgow. The Glasgow journal, which
didn’t know that the Auckland one stole the article, was
interested in a quotation I made from a Maoriland
book—a book, that is, written, printed and published in
Maoriland —and advanced various facts by way of show
ing that a date mentioned in the quotation was incorrect.
Observe the position. This parasitical Auckland news-
paper depends on London for the free filling-up of
its columns, and it has to go to Glasgow for information,
not only about Maoriland books, but also about Maori-
land history. And a good many more Maoriland papers
are in precisely the same category. Taken as a whole
they are a measly lot.
, * * * *
Some of the English newspapers have abandoned the
old habit of giving to foreign theatrical artists their
national titular distinctions, as though there were no
equivalent for them. Signor and signorita, or senor and
senorita, are now made to understand that they are
Mr. and Miss in English-speaking countries. Also the
new rule holds good as regards monsieur and mademoi-
selle. But there is a tendency to meet a “madame”
half-way, and give her the anglicised title of madam
rather than “ Mrs.” After all “ Mrs.” is only an abbre-
viation of “mistress,” which ceased to be synonymous
with “ wife ” when it came to Court. Giddy Charles the
Second seems to have divested the term mistress of
much of its original significance and respectability when
he associated his royal name with Nell Gwynne and other
easy-going spinsters, who were politely spoken of as “ the
King’s mistresses.”
■* • • »
“Ejayem”: Among the curses of suburban and pro-
vincial journalism are the patronising and impertinent
councillor and the local parson. When Arthur Rees
(before he joined the Age) was attached to a South
Melbourne bugle he had often to choke off the usual
clerical genius who “ used-to write for the Times ” (W. P. B.
doubtless). Present writer was with Rees at the South
Melbourne Town Hall on the occasion of the memorial
service to the late Queen Victoria. They had rigged up
a sort of Punch and Judy dais for the preachers in the
middle of the premises, and next to this funereal
platform the table for the ink-slingers was placed. As
the solemn procession of parsons wended its way to the
sombre-draped platform, one of them cast a malevolent,
blightingglance at Rees, and then shook his head and gazed
Heavenwards. “ What have you done to the sin-shifter ? ”
I whispered. Rees produced a big grin. “ He interviewed
me twice about uplifting the paper, and when he sent in
ten columns of stuff to uplift it with, I put the tripe in the
basket with a deadly thud." The tail end of the proces-
sion included a person with considerable whiskers.
Marching up to Rees in quite a commanding fashion, he
said: “ Kindly send me in a proof of my prayah ! ”
Presently it came to his turn to speak his “prayah !”
He fell on his hunkers and started to blow off his suppli-
cation. He blew devoutly for some time. Then slowly
his eyes opened and rested on the Archimedean lever.
The Argus man was leaning forward, with his chin rest-
ing in his hands. The Age man was leaning back with
his hands clasped behind his head. The local paper man
was looking at the roof, with his pencil between his
teeth. The preacher almost gnashed his teeth at the
Archimedean lever before he resumed, which he did with
extra vehemence, Rees leaned forward and hissed.
“ Did you see that ? He hasn’t been praying to God ; he’s
been praying to us—praying to the press. lie can go to
old Nick for his proof of ‘ my prayah.’ ’•
THE TEMPTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He came to me in friendly form,
He greeted me with oily guile,
He looked at me in manner warm,
And threw at me a ghastly smile.
The days were dull and work was scarce,
The Muses smiled not on my rhyme ;
And I was sick—so was my verse.
The duns would grant no further time.
I thought he was a proper friend,
The words he uttered touched my heart.
Said I, “ This man will surely lend
Me half-a-sov. to ease the smart
“ Of gloomy days and thirsty nights.”
And so I pushed at him my ear
What time I stood upon the heights
Of joy, and sniffed big mugs of beer.
And then he said, “ I know you write,
And you are stony. Are you not ? ”
And I said, “ What you say is quite
Correct, and things are rather rot- .
Ten.” Then close over me he bent
And said, “Just write for me in verse
\ A brief and nice advertisement
And I will give ” “ Biff 1 Whish ! Oh ! Curse ! ”
Don’t ask me what to him I did ;
And how I kicked him high and low.
Don’t ask me where the body’s hid ;
My soul hath sins enough I know !

AN IMPORTANT! DISCOVERY.
It will interest sufferers to know
that a valuable medicine, called Froo-
toids, has been discovered, which is
now completely curing each of tile
above-named complaints. Frootoids
are elegant in appearance, and plea-
sant to take, and, what is of the ut-
most importance, are thoroughly reli-
able in affording quick relief. You
do not require to go on taking them
for a prolonged period, as is necessary
with some medicines, which even then
are mostly disappointing; you simply
take a dose of Frootoids when ill and
repeat the dose if necessary, but gene-
rally one dose is quite effective.
> Frootoids are immensely more valu-
able than an ordinary aperient, in so
far that they not only act as an ape-
rient, but do remove from the blood,
tissues, and internal organs all the
Waste poisonous matter that is clog-
ging them and choking the channels
that lead to and from them. The bene-
ficial effects of Frootoids are evident
at once by the disappearance of head-
ache, the head becoming clear, and a
bright, cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish, depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly,
and by the food being properly di-
gested.
Frootoids are the proper aperient
medicine to take when any Congestion
or Blood Poison is present, or when
Congestion of the Brain or Apoplexy
is present or threatening. They have
been tested, and have been proved to
afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have not done any
good at all. It is of the utmost impor-
tance that this should be borne in
mind, for in such cases to take an or-
dinary aperient is to waste time and
permit of a serious illness becoming
fatal.
Frootoids act splendidly on the liver,
and quickly cure bilious attacks that
antibilious pills make worse. Many
people have been made sick and ill
by antibilious pills that could have
been cured at once by Frootoids.
People should not allow themselves to
be duped into contracting a medicine-
taking habit by being persuaded to
take daily doses with each meal of so-
called indigestion cures that do NOT
cure. Frootoids have been subjected
to extensive tests, and have in every
case proved successful in completely
curing the complaints named.
A constipated habit of body will be
completely cured if the patient will on
each occasion, when suffering, take a
dose ot Frootoids, instead of an or-
dinary aperient; by so doing, the pa-
tient will require doses only at longer
intervals, and will so become quite
independent of the necessity of taking
any aperient medicine.
' Frootoids are only now being placed
on the Australian market, consequently
you may at present have a difficulty
in. getting them from your local che-
mist or storekeeper; but ask for them,
and if you cannot get them at once,
send stamps or postal note for price,
1/6, to W. G. Hearne, Chemist, Gee-
long, and a bottle of them will be im-
mediately forwarded to you post free.
Chemists, storekeepers, and whole-
salers can now obtain wholesale sup-
plies from W. G. Hearne, Chemist,

I had about given up taking a journey, but when you
advised it so strongly, I reconsidered and took the
journey, passed my examinations, and am now in a
position to earn from £2O to £25 per month. I would
not take £lO for the advice you gave me.
I believe every young person starting in life should
by all means secure a Horoscope from you. Nothing
I ever received has given me such power to control
conditions and circumstances as your Horoscope.
Wishing you every success, I am, yours truly,
B. H. RANDALL.
THE accuracy of recent predictions made by
this eminent Astrologer has caused many
of his friends to believe that he possesses
a supernatural power, but he modestly asserts
that his predictions are due alone to a scien-
tific understanding of natural laws. The many
thankful letters Prof. De Astro has received
from people who have benefited by his advice
furnish ample proof that he is sincere in his
work and has a kindly feeling towards
humanity.
Readers of The Bulletin can obtain a
Reading by addressing a letter to Prof. De
Astro, 366 Bourke Street, Melbourne. Simply
say you wish a Reading of your Life, stating
your birth date, sex, and whether married
or single, enclosing Is. Stamps or Postal Note
to pay postage etc., and the Reading will
be promptly sent.

able, as it EFFECTS A COMPLETE CURE. It is most comforting in allaying irritation to the Throat and giving strength to the

CURE.
A SUFFERER 70 YEARS OLD CURED BY IT.
WELL AND HEARTY NOW.
~ r ' Hearne. Dear Sir, —I am a storekeeper, living’ in this township for the last 20 years. One of my
oldest customers has been subject to Bronchitis for a number of years, and has been in the hospital with it
several times. Hearing of your valuable medicine, he tried it, and found that it gave him great relief. One
Dottle was sufficient to put him right. This gentleman is over 70 years of age, an old bushman, who has been
m tnese parts lor the last 30 years, and is well known. He makes my house his home when here, and got the
medicine from me. He is at my place now, and he says that this winter is the freest he has had from Bronchitis
lor a number of years, and he washes to return you thanks for your valuable Bronchitis Cure. He is well and
nearly now. You are quite at liberty to publish this or any part of it you like, as it may be of great benefit
to other people suffering from Bronchitis.—Yours truly,

CURED BY HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE.
AFTER OTHER TREATMENT HAD FAILED.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I write to add my testimony to the wonderful effect of your Bronchitis Cure. I
suffered for H months with a terrible cough. It was so distressingly bad at night that I could not get any sleep.
1 consulted doctors to no purpose. I saw your medicine advertised, and sent for a bottle, which has t' ken the
cough clean away, and I feel a different man. You may depend on my making your wonderful medicine known.
1 have sent for another bottle to keep by me in case the cough may return at any time. lam writing this, as lam
sure there are a great many people out this way that, if they knew the wonderful effect of this medicine, would
send and procure it at any price.—Yours faithfully,
J. P. BOYD, Contractor, Torrens Creek, North Queensland.

A COMMERCIAL TRAVELLER SUFFERING INTENSELY CURED BY HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE.
HAS SINCE CAMPED OUT AND TRAVELLED MUCH WITHOUT CONTRACTING A COLD.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir,—ln 1898 (I was for four years previously in Queensland travelling representative
for a mercantile house), having contracted a heavy cold, I placed myself under a medical man, and used all kinds
of chennsts prescriptions wuthout avail. I was then staying at Hayes’ Terminus Hotel, Brisbane. The manager
did all possible for me, for which I shall always feel grateful. Mr. Duncan Currie, at that time acting manager for
the New York Life Insurance Co., came to,see me daily, and he advised me to try your Bronchitis Cure. I was about
done for, could noteat, or scarcely swallow ; in fact, used to nearly suffocate a dozen times a day, suffering intensely
Guess of my thankfulness when Mr. Currie brought me a bottle of your Bronchitis Cure. A few doses actually cured
me. I took another bottle away from the city with me, and gave part of it to a young girl at Southport, and it
also saved her life. The balance I gave to Mr. T. McMillan, Tweed River—three persons cured by your valuable
medicine. Although I have camped out and travelled ahout 10,000 miles since my illness, I have not contracted a
cold since.—l am, Sir, your best well-wisher,
, THOS. ROSS, Lebasa, via Suva, Fiji.

IT MADE A NEW MAN OF HIM.
NO SHORTNESS OF BREATH SINCE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I had Bronchitis several times since 1898 in Victoria, Western Australia, and
here, and had paid many pounds away in medicine ; but when I arrived in Cairns in 1900, from Western Australia,
I was induced to try your Bronchitis Cure. I took five bottles, and it made a new man of me. I could afterwards
run a mile or climb up and down a vertical shaft without any feeling of shortness of breath. No medicine for
Bronchitis that I have ever taken has afforded me such relief as your Bronchitis Cure.—Yours faithfully,
RICHARD COLLINS, Mine Manager, Irvinebank, via Cairns, North Queensland.

TWO PERSONS IN NEW ZEALAND CURED BY ONE BOTTLE OF HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE.
ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN SUFFERING FOR TWELVE MONTHS.
Mr. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I had a very bad cough, so I bought one bottle of your Bronchitis Cure, and used about
one-half of it, which cured my cough in two or three days. My daughter, who had been troubled with a had cough
for the past twelve months, then used the remaining half of the medicine, and it cured her also. I think your
Bronchitis Cure is a wonderful remedy.
I have lived on my farm at Bombay for about 36 ye£trs. You are at liberty to use this letter in any wav you
please. Yours respectfully, CHAS. WOOTTON, Bombay, Auckland, New Zealand.

IMMEDIATE RELIEF AND COMPLETE CURE BY HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I feel in duty bound to express my gratitude, first to you for your marvellous
Bronchitis and Asthma Cure ; next to Mr. Cheshire, Chemist, North Brighton, for having so valuable a cure in
stock. My wife, being a sufferer for years, I purchased one bottle of your Bronchitis Cure. It gave immediate

ances who suffer with the same. You can use this letter for publication if you wish.—Yours sincerely,
F. A. CUTTEN, Elsternwick, Victoria.

February in Melbourne, and was recommended by a friend to try your Bronchitis Cure. 'After three doses I felt
immense relief, and the cough vanished before the first bottle was finished. Before leaving Melbourne I obtained
three bottles of it, as I would not like to be without so wonderful a medicine.—Yours faithfully,
N. KILMARTIN, Darlinghurst, Sydney.
SEVERE COUGH—A 5 YEARS CASE.
RELIEVED AT ONCE AND COMPLETELY CURED BY HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE.

ment from different sources, but derived no benefit until I used your Bronchitis Cure, -which gave me relief at once,
and completely cured me. lam delighted with it. It is a really wonderful medicine ; does good at once, and can’t
be licked.—Yours sincerely, W. TREMELLEN, Modewarre, Victoria.
ASTHMA—A 17 YEARS CASE.
PREVIOUS TREATMENT FAILED.
CURED BY THREE BOTTLES.
Mr. Alex. J. Anderson, of Oak Park, Charleville, Queensland, writes After suffering from asthma for seven-
teen years, and having been under a great many different treatments without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne’s
Medicine for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this medicine, I quite got rid of the asthma, and since then,
which was the beginning of 1883—fifteen years ago-—I have not had the slightest return of it. The medicine quite
cured me, and I have much pleasure in recommencing it.”
Writing two years later he states: —“ lam keeping very well. Never have the slightest return of the asthma.”
GRATITUDE AND APPRECIATION.
HUNDREDS CURED IN THEIR OWN CIRCLE.
The Scientific Australian Office,
169 Queen Street, Melbourne.
Dear Mr. Hearne.—The silent workers are frequently the most effective, and if there is anybody in Victoria who,
during the last few years, has been repeatedly working for and singing the praises of Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, it is
our Mr. Philips.
This gentleman, some three years ago, was recommended to try your Bronchitis Cure by Mr. Barham,
accountant, Collips Street, and the effect that it had was so marked that he has ever since been continually recom-
mending it to others. "
We are glad to add this our testimony to the value of Hearne’s most valuable Bronchitis. Cure, which has eased
the sufferings of hundreds and hundreds of people even in our own circle of acquaintances.
Believe us always to be, yours niost faithfully,
PHILLIPS, ORMONDE & CO.
BEWARE OF IMITATIONSI The great success of HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE has induced a number of
unprincipled persons to make imitations, each calling his medicine “ Bronchitis Cure,” with the object of deceiving the simple-
minded, and so getting a sale for an imitation which has none of the beneficial effects that HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE
has. Consequently it has become necessary to draw your attention to this fact, and to request you in your own interests to ba
particular to ask for HEARNE’S and see that you get it.

“The Grunyah’s ” little tale
The continual growling of “ Pro Bono Publico,” “Indig-
nant Taxpayer,” etc., had, until recently, given me the
impression that the Commonwealth Government Depart-
ments were the holders of the prize in the Red Tape and
Sealing Wax Section, but I now think that the following
should about annex the trophy.
Hear my lament !
After months of worry, and after struggling through
various Acts and Regulations of the United States Patent
Office, J thought my papers were, at last, correct for the
filing oi a patent, and consequently heaved a sigh of relief.
Sent papers along together with the $l5 filing fee, also
a working model of the invention for the flotation of a
company in Doilardom. By last mail received, in reply,
a letter headed like a writ for had debt, signed by a man
whose name looks like the Pilliga scrub and sealed with the
seal of the U.S. Congress. In this formidable document
the Office politely informed me. that my application for a
patent could not under any circumstances be recorded,
filed or considered, for the reason that on one sheet of the
drawings—there were 18 in all—one of my witnesses had
omitted to sign. The writ went on to say that the man
with the jungle of an autograph had paid my $l5 into
revenue pending further action, and that he would return
the culprit drawing for completion, on receipt of 15 cents
to cover postage.
Thus for the missing of a signature, Doilardom collared
my $l5, and I lost —on account of the publication of my
invention per medium of the working models forwarded—
all my patent rights.
If any of The Bulletin’s scribes can point out a worse
case of Red Tapeism in any Commonwealth Department,
then that Department should be “named’’ and handed
the prize, same being one tin of insecticide.
Extract from a review of a recent work,
“Baby Toilers,” showing the lot of the worker in
Freetrade and landlord-ruled England :
It is a striking contrast with which Mrs. Mackirdy:
(“ Olive Christian Malvery ”) opens her book. First she
pictures a Confirmation scene in a Roman Catholic
church —the deep-toned organ, the sun streaming
through richly-colored windows, the scent of the incense,
the bishop and priests in rich robes, the young girls in
white, crowned with dainty chaplets of white and silver
flowers. And then, the room in which those wreaths
were made by other girls :
“One child was seven, and the other ten... .Once I went
in when the small girl was ill. You could see her fore-
head throb ! She lav on an unmade bed, with a few rags
over her, and though the little mouth was hot and
parched, neither the mother nor the sister had the time
to leave their table of toil and fetch the mite a drink of
water. The water was in the yard, down some steps and
up again, and it might have taken, perhaps, seven or eight
minutes to fetch it into the house The motherland
sister had been at work since about four o’clock .that
morning—they were a hand short—and they worked with
scarcely a break until ten or eleven at night. They were
making Confirmation wreaths, and the price paid was
Is. Sd. per dozen for the finished wreaths. Each flower
is made separately, and every wreath requires something
like a gross of small white flowers.. . . Twopence an hour
is a wage which can be earned by expert workers....
Out of this money the worker has* to provide the gum
and paste, and, of course, the gas with which she warms
her instruments.”

WHAT IS CATARRH?
CATARRH is inflammation of the lining
membrane of the nose and adjoining
passages. If this inflammation is not ar-
rested it invades the passages which lead
from the nose to the head, ears, throat and
lungs. It injures the sight and hearing,
destroys the sense of taste and smell, ren-
ders the breath offensive, breaks down
the affected tissues, and consumes the
nasal cartilages. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and stomach, causes
dyspepsia, also consumption. Do you

EIGHT YEARS SUFFERING
A PERMANENT CURE.
THE CASE OF MRS. A. WEAVER.
BY A SYDNEY REPORTER.
No one can tell the self-denying work which
good men have done in the early days of this
country, neither can we exaggerate the nobleness
of spirit which animates present-day people in a
desire to ameliorate distress as much as lies in their
power. Therefore, the public should be informed
of some of these efforts, one of which was made by
Mrs. Alice Weaver, of No. 7 Louis Street, Redfern,
who replied to the reporter by Saying :
“ About this time last year I was living in
Telopea Street, and it was just before I left there
for this place that I was fortunate in casting aside
a complaint that had worried me for no less than
eight years. What a fearfulTife of suffering mine
had been all that time, to be sure, and to think that
nothing in the world could benefit me made my
spirits droop lower than they will ever be again,
I hope.”
“What made you think that nothing could
benefit you ? ” queried the writer.
“I arrived at that conclusion because nothing
had done me good so far, and I believe I tried
every medicine going. At the time my second
child was born I was under a doctor, who did
everything he could for me, but still my health re-
mained as bad as it could bes. Indeed, at that
period I was nearly dead with indigestion, al-
though I dieted myself and did all that could be
done to keep my torments in check. It was of no
avail, though, for when I ate anything I could
hardly breathe owing to a feeling which came like
a lump in my chest, from which place a sharp pain
went right through to the centre of my shoulders.
I then remained in the utmost agony until the food
was vomited up again, after which I felt so ex-
hausted that I could not think of doing a thing in
the house until I had had a good rest. It would
surpriseyouifyou only knew how poor my appetite
was. You would wonder how anyone could keep
alive with it, and as for my head, oh, my sufferings
with it were awful. The most piercing pains at
onetime, and the most depressing achesat another.
Really, I think it was a marvel how I kept my
senses with the agony I endured in the head ; and
it’s strange that I did not meet .with many a nasty
accident through the giddiness,which used to over-
take me. I was a misery to myself and everybody
around me, and to tell you the honest truth I never
thought I would live through it all. My eyes used
to feel heavy enough to drop out of their sockets,
and I was affected in the mouth by such a bitter
taste that it made me feel sick of a morning, after
putting in the usual restless nights that had done
much towards making a wreck of me. Even in the
daytime I was alwaysimagining something terrible
was going to happen, and these were just the very
things that Clements Tonic, which I commenced to
take, showed itself to be the master of ; for it sent
such a vigor through my frame, when I had been
taking it a couple of weeks, that I could not help
feeling joyful in the belief that at last my health
had taken a beneficial turn. I got more Clements
Tonic, and as each bottle was finished, so did my
prospects improve, for I commenced to take my
meals with a degree of heartiness whi h astonished
my people as much as it pleased them ; and to my
own satisfaction anddelight theformer discomforts
attending my meals were quickly out of existence.
Oh, dear, what a changed woman I am now to then.
Mv limbs do not ache from weakness like they
formerly did, and I can go about my work as
cheerfully and as actively as any housewife in the
country. Ido not spend any restless nights now;
never dream during my sleep, and the pains that
used to abound have long since been driven away
from every part of my body. Well, Clements
Tonic made me the healthy woman I am, and for
the sake of other sufferers I trust you’ll publish
this interview in any way you think fit-”
STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, Alice Weaver, of Yo. 7 Louis Street, Redfern, in the
State of New South Wales, Commonwealth of Australia,
do solemnly and sincerely declare that I have carefully
read the annexed document, and that it contains, and is

Clements Tonic, and also contains my full permission to
publish in any way my statements, which I give voluntary,
without receiving- any payment, and I make this solemn
declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true,
and by virtue of the provisions of the Oaths Act, 1900.

ELECTRIC BELT
HADE US STRONG
We receive these sort of letters every day. We have thousands of them and WE GUARANTEE every one to be
genuine, and given to us freely and without pay of any kind. We will pay £lOO reward for proof to the contrary.
Nervousness, Dyspepsia, etc.
The Dr. McLaughlin Co.
It is with great pleasure that I am sending you
this statement. I had been suffering from Indiges-
tion and nervousness for years and could not get
cured. I saw doctors and took a lot of patent
medicines without deriving any benefits from them.
Last September my condition became so serious as
to cause me uneasiness. I could not eat, having no
appetite. The sight of food seemed to turn me
sick, and seeing your Belt advertised I thought I
would give one of them a trial. I bought one and
am very pleased to say that after wearing it for
three months I derived great benefit from it. I can
now eat well, sleep well and get up in the morning
feeling refreshed and fit for work ; I never felt
better in my life.
I shall be very pleased at any time to tell any
fellow-sufferers the benefit I received from your
wonderful Belt.
Thanking you for what you have done for me,
Yours truly, T. J. SHARPLESS,
Manildra, N.S.W.
Weak Back, Lumbago.
The Dr. McLaughlin Co.
In reply to yours of recent date I am pleased to
be in a position to state that the Belt supplied me
has completely cured my back, and it has been
strong and well now for nearly twd years; to those
suffering from a lame back I can recommend it as a
sure cure. My work includes heavy riding, pick
and shovel, fencing, and all such kind of work as
is followed by a station hand.—Yours gratefully,
JAMES ARMSTRONG, Jnr.,
Arches Siding, N. Ci Railway,
Rockhampton, Q’land.
Weak Back, Pains in Legs, General
Debility.
The Dr. McLaughlin Co.
In reply to your enquiries about my health since
wearing your Belt, it is with thanks I am able to
state that I have received great benefits, and am now
quite well, and a new man again. I find after using
your High-Grade Belt that I am quite free from the
complaints that I suffered from, and I certainly can
recommend it to anyone suffering from either a
Weak Back, Pains in the Legs or General Debility.
Yours faithfully, H. SAMUEL,

A Woman’s Hiraculous Cure c..
Rheumatism.
The Dr. McLaughlin Co.
No pen or tongue can describe my sufferings
before I began to use one of Dr. McLaughlin’s
Belts. I could not get into bed, either dress or
undress myself, and often had to sit on a chair on
which a pillow was placed, and to rise from a
seat I had to draw myself up gradually; my feet
resembled two roly-polys, and I was in mortal
agony. Scores of people never expected to see me
able to walk again without assistance. lam just a
living miracle. A fortnight yesterday I went a
railway journey alone, and returned yesterday
alone, took a cab from the station home and got in
and out of the cab without assistance. I sometimes
think; can it be true? I’ve suffered so much —a
wonder to myself. I have not worn the Belt since
last June. I can now do all domestic duties,
washing and ironing included, make my own
clothing and thank God I rejoice to be able to say
I went out and did some shopping last night, and
though my daughter was with me I never once took
her arm for support. The first time for six long
weary years. Oh! how I wish I could tell to all the
world what Dr. McLaughlin’s Belt has done for me.
I would like to tell every little detail, but it would
require a short-hand writer to take it all I
I am so glad I can testify to sufferers the wonders
of the Belt. Mrs. S. G. CORY,
37 Short Street,
Bendigo, Vic.
Rheumatism, Indigestion, Constipation.
The Dr. McLaughlin Co.
I was in the hospital for several months under
the very best doctors that were to be got and
received no benefit from them, so I discharged
myself from the hospital thinking to try a Dr.
McLaughlin Electric Belt, which I did and with
great satisfaction, as the disease from which I
suffered (after all else had failed) began to leave me
after the first month’s use. After the third month’s
use I was cured.
I could not work for eighteen months, but after
using the Belt for three months I was able to go
back to my work, which is very haid as I am
quarrying. If anyone writes to me I will be only
too pleased to let them know what your Belt done
for me. Yours sincerely,
C. BROADBENT,
Bell Street, Coburg, Vic.
General Debility, Indigestion, Weak Back.
This is to certify that I have worn a Dr.
McLaughlin Electric Belt since the 12th October,
1906 up to Ist January, 1907, and I have received a
won#' -ful amount of good from it for what I might
call a broken-down system, having been a sufferer
from Debility, Indigestion, and General Weakness.
I now feel quite a different man in every way;
work is no trouble to me. I advise anyone suffer-
ing from any of the above complaints to use a Dr.
McLaughlin Electric Belt, as I am sure it will bring
about a certain cure.—WILLIAM E. ALDER,
Manning Road, via Gloucester, N.S.W.
Female Weakness, Headaches, Debility.
I consider it my duty, not only as a patient, but
as one who has been so courteously treated, to tell
you that after wearing one of your Belts for three
months, that l am almost cured of all my ailments.
I think that if I had not got the Belt when
I did, I would now be in my grave or an
asylum, as I felt I was going out of my mind. I
suffered something terrible with my head, when it
got bad I had to sit and keep my eyes on one
thing, and sometimes I felt so bad that I prayed
for death. I suffered terrible with palpitation of
the heart, Indigestion and General Weakness, but
thanks to your wonderful Belt I am now a new
woman. I have advised all my friends that are
ailing to try your Electric Belt and explained to
them the position I was in when I first used it.
Mrs. J. W. SANDERSON, Wyong, N.S.W.
Woman Cured to Stay Cured.
After using your Belt for one month, I have not
suffered with that terrible pain in the chest since.
It is now six months since I used the Belt last, and
I think that is a good proof of my cure. Wishing
you every success, I am, etc. ANNIE WILSON,
Lome Station, Via Blackall, Q’land.
Doctors Failed ; Belt Cured Her.
For some years I suffered from Womb Trouble,
Aching Back, and Constipation. I tried many
Doctors but got no relief, and hearing of your
valuable Belt I decided to try it. I received your
Belt eleven months ago, wore it, and now I am
perfectly cured. I sincerely advise any suffering
woman to get your valuable Belt, for I am certain
it will cure them. Wishing your Belt every success,

Oatine
r is the great face cream
that is making so
many English com-
plexions clear and
beautiful.
A year ago Oatine was unknown in Eng-
and, now it is used by every woman who
/alues a good complexion.
Merit alone has built up its enormous popu-
larity. Oatine is a pure face cream, cooling
and refreshing, free from animal fat and
dangerous minerals. It removes the dust
and dirt that soap and water cannot reach
from the pores, and keeps the skin soft,
delicate and dear. It does not grow hair.
Being made from fresh pure oats, heat does
not cause it to go bad.
It is the ideal face cream for Australians,
and will enable any woman to keep a fresh
clear complexion in the dry Australian
climate. Men use it after shaving.
In jars 1/9, or large size, four times the
amount, 3/6 .

The Legion of the Lost.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ON Wings of Hope uplifted
From youth, and many dreams—
By strange winds drawn and
drifted,
By divers roads and streams —
We come from all ways hither,
By tide and tempest tossed,
And journey, none knows whither—
The Legion of the Lost!
The highways whence we started
Are hidden in the past.
For long since have we parted
With ties of kin and caste.
We drift away, we others,
From holding, home and wife,
And leave our sober brothers
To till their plots of life.
We are the stones, that, rolling,
Must count the years a loss,
And take at last the doling
Of other people’s moss;
Yet we, who, in all weather,
Have known the bush so well—
We of the wild bird’s feather
May never captive dwell!
We cannot do but wander
From Autumn round to Spring,
For ever Further Yonder
Our thoughts are on the wing.
We build and garner never;
The deserts we have crossed
Still urge us forward ever—
The Legion of the Lost.
For each was born a rover,
Nor can he thwart his fate,
And when his days are over
He’ll enter through the gate
As naked, at his passing,
As to the world he came—
But those who worked amassing
Must even do the same !
Though, in some hidden pocket,
I’ve known a few that wear
A letter or a locket,
A little wisp of hair,
Their dear possessions only,
Held fast in sordid days
To cheer them, being lonely,
<on those forgotten ways.
We drift abroad and scatter;
Our graves are none knows where;
The men who do not matter—
The men who do not care ;
On shores forgotten landed,
By tide and tempest tossed,
Afloat, or sunk, or stranded,
The Legion of the Lost!

In The Small Hours.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
small, red-faced cabman pulled up, and
1 opening the window of the four-wheeler,
shook his fist in Wilson’s face.
“Look ’ere,” he hissed, “don’ you tork
t' me ! ’'
Wilson— who is six-feet-three and athletic—
Winked inanely at him, and asked “ Why not,
'lie chap?”
Because,” said the enraged cabman, “ I won’
ffianky well start it ! ”
Wilson took out his watch and yawned.
“Cabbie,” he said, “I’d be’stremely’bliged t’
yer if you'd start th’ horse.”
“Well, I won't start th’ horse ! ”
“ W’y not! "
Because I ’aven’t bin paid ! ”
Wilson is always polite and calm and cool. In
the very early hours these vices are accentuated.
He started to review their transactions of the
previous three hours.
“ Look here, cabbie, I’ve told you’bout five
hundred times already that I’m short of money,
haven't I?”
“Yes, but”
An Ive also told you I haven’t remotest
chance gettin’ any more this time night, didn't I?”
“Yes, you did ! But ”
“ Well, what d’ye ’spect me t’ do?"
Get out ! ” yelled the cabman. ‘ ‘ Get out an’
walk ! ”
Wilson smiled at him. “My dear fren’,” he
said, ‘ ‘ I don’t think you’re an intell’gent cabman
at all! I don’ know how you ever came to be a
cabman ! How’d it happen ? ”
The diiver nearly burst. “ I’m an hones’
man, he shouted, “ an’ I pay my way ! "
“ Qui’ ri’ ! ” said Wilson approvingly. “ Tha’s
proper ideal f’r working classes. How many
children have y’ got ? ”
“ What’s that got to do with it ? ”
“ I beg your pardon ? ”
“ What’s that got t’ do with it ?”
“ Do with what, my man ? ”
“You ridin’ fr nothin’ in my cab ! ”
Wilson tapped him on the shoulder. “ Look
here,” he said, “ I suppose I’ve met, durin’ last
thirty years, at least two thousan’ cabmen, an’ not
one of ’em talked as much as you do ! I wouldn’t
nun’ it so much if you kept th’ horse going while
you converse; but you don't. Ev’ry now an’
then you stop th’ poor beast an’ let it shiver while
you talk rot. You’ll pardon me saying it, ole
man, but you’re a frightful gasbag—frightful! ”
Once again the cabman shook his fist in Wil-
son s face.
“ What do you think I am ? ” he yelled.
“ I think you’re ’stremely ’fensive.”
“ W’y don’t y’ pay ? ”
“ Because I can't!"
“ Well, get out an’ walk l ”
“ I won't / ”
The small cabman measured Wilson with his
gnashed his teeth, and hissed 1 ‘ I'll fix you
up, my friend ! I'll take you somewhere ! ”
“ I wish t’ Heaven you would, ole man ! ”
“ Yes,” snarled the driver, “ I will! ”
“ I’m ’stremely ’bliged t’ you ! ”
The cab jolted on, and Wilson fell asleep in
the corner.
When he awoke, he found the cab had stopped,
and the cabman, accompanied by a policeman,
standing at the door.
“ There he is ! ” the driver was saying.
“ Good-night, sir,” said the constable.
“ How d’ye do?” said Wilson, gravely extend-
ing his hand.
“ Cabman tells me you won’t pay him, sir.”
“ Wrong,” said Wilson, “ I didn’t tell him
anything of th’ kind ! I said I couldn't pay ! ”
“ That won’t dp, sir ! " ,
Wilson agreed with him. Wilson admitted it
was an unsatisfactory state of affairs. He grew
confidential, and related many similar instances—
curiously involved stories of long-gone mornings
and ancient cabs—mysterious detached fragments
of adventure rummaged out of the recesses of a
fogged memory, and given to the constable for
nothing in the cold dawn. It seemed as if he—■
Wilson—had spent the best part of his life adrift
in cabs manned by hostile cabmen.
And, all the time, the driver stood by repeat-
ing a sort of awful litany made up of six ejacula-
tions :
“ Make ’im pay ! ”
“Well, w’y d’yer ride in kebs?”
“ I ain’t goin’t’ stan’ ’ere all night."
“ Well, I’ll summons yer and charnce it! ”
“ Th’ likes o’ you oughter walk ! ”
“ Don’ you talk t’ me!"
Then again, “ Make ’im pay ! ” and so on.
The constable, at first, tried to stem the flow
of Wilson’s recollections. Then he made several
spasmodic attempts to interrupt him. But Wilson
was not to be interrupted. He waved the
matter of payment aside as a trivial thing of no
interest, and continued his sermon on cabs until
the driver climbed back to his seat and, thrusting
the butt-end of his whip through the window,
poked him gently in the ribs.
Wilson, with his arms outspread in an eloquent
gesture, stopped in the middle of a sentence, and,
turning slowly round, peered into the dark
interior of the cab.
“ Wha’s that ! ”he cried indignantly : “ wha’s
that ! ”
“Me?” murmured the cabman, in a weak
voice.
“ What are y’ ! ”
“ I’m th’ driver ! ”
“Th’ what?"
“ Th’ driver ! "
“ Where are y’ ? ”
“ I’m 'ere ! ”
Wilson groped in the gloom with both arms
and found nothing. Then he turned to the
choking constable and remarked angrily, “ There
isn’t anything! Th’ blessed bathing-box is
haunted ! ”
The constable perceived that the cabman had
drifted entirely out of Wilson’s recollection. He
gently, but firmly, introduced the subject, and
suggested that the man should be dismissed.
“ Cert’nly ! ” said Wilson, as he got out.
“ It’s all he deserves —d’smiss him ’mediately ! ”
The driver rushed round fuming, and caught
Wilson’s arm.
“ ’Ere,” he said, “ ’ow much longer am I coin’
t’ wait ? ”
Wilson wheeled round, and a gleam of recol-
lection stole into his eye. “ Hullo ! you’re th’
cabbie, aren’t y’ ? ”
“Yes, I'm the cabman ! ”
“ Yes,” said Wilson, serenely. “/remember
y’ ! You’re the cabbie that’s been gassin’ all
ni’ ! ”
“ Yes, an’ I’ll keep on gassin’ till I get my
money ! ”
The constable intervened. “ Pay him off,” he
advised. “ Pay him off and get rid of him.”
Wilson seemed struck with the idea. He
patted the policeman, and said “ That’s ri’ !
That’s jus’ what ’ll do ! I’ll pay him off! ”
“ That’s right!”
“ Yesh, I’ll pay him off an’ ” —with a sweep of
the arm—“ an’ I'll get rid of him ! ”
“ That's right! ”
“ Y’ know I want t’ get rid of him ! ”
“Yes.”
Wilson turned to the man and addressed him
sternly. “ Look here, my fren’, I’m goin’t’ pay
you off!"
“Yes, fr Gord’s sake pay me orf ! ”
“ An’—an’ I’m goin' f get rid of y' /"
“ Orright— orright! "
“ How much do I owe yer ?”
“ Call it ten shillin’s !”
Wilson fumbled in his vest pocket and drew
out a coin, which he closely inspected, and then
handed to the cabman.
The cabman looked at it in the light of the
lamp, and whined, “What’s th’ good o’ this?"
Wilson said angrily, “ It’s a sov’r’n, isn’t it ? ”
“ Yes, but I ain’t got no change ! ”
“ Well, who asked y’ f r charge ? I didn’t ask
y’ f r change ! ”
The driver mumbled something, and hurriedly
clambered up on the box seat, as if he feared
Wilson might alter his mind. Then he gathered
up the reins, and murmured apologetically:
“ Goo’ ni’, sir ! ”
Wilson, who was explaining something to the
constable, took no notice.
“ Goo’ nil, sir ! ”
Wilson manipulated an imaginary cue, and
showed the constable how he made the shot.
The driver leant out and stirred him gratefully
with the whip. “ Goo’ni’, sir—an’—an’ thank
y’, sir ! ”
Wilson begged the constable to excuse him,
and walked unsteadily to the cab. “ Look here,
my fren’,” he said, “ I’ll give you one more chance
—jus’ one more ! If y’ don’ shut up an’ clear out
now, I’ll pull y’r rotten ole shay t’ pieces, an’
throw th’ horse' at yer ! D’ye un’stan’ me ! ”
The cabman, without another word, swung
round on the seat and shook out the reins. • “Git
up ! Dammit ! git up ! ”
The horse looked round reproachfully and
started off.
Wilson stood on the kerb and told the con-
stable : “ Fearful gasbag, that man, I ’sure you !
Talked to me whole damn night ! ”

A Mother’s Great Praise.
“I have used your Bile Beans now for eight or nine years,” says Mrs. M. Shanks, of
East Street, Mt. Morgan, Q. “ The sedentary nature of my occupation, that of dressmaker,
has a natural tendency to impair the health, and consequently I am a sufferer, at times, from
sick headache, biliousness and constipation. I always keep a box of Bile Beans in the
house, however, and a dose or two of this famous medicine soon ends my headache or
biliousness, clears away the constipation, and puts me in good working order. My children
also take Bile Beans whenever inclined to be bilious, run-down, out-of-sorts, or with no
appetite, and their effect is wonderful.”

Down Where the Lachlan
Flows.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I MET her first at a country dance.
Her eyes crossed mine in a backward glance
That fired my soul to a torrid love
Like the hot, hot night in the sky above.
I was fresh from town. I had scorned the sex,
And pitied the sickly fools who vex
Their hearts with a woman’s love and hate,
And flaunt their lives in the face of Fate.
But—to-night my heart in its dreaming goes
To Wunya, down where the Lachlan flows.
She was waltzing there with a moon-eyed clod
Whose face was turned to its natal sod
In the bestial stare of the under-born
And she left me there with a heart forlorn.
For the game was hers, and she played it fine ;
But I kissed her lips, and the game was mine.
I pressed her close in the throb.bing dance,
And our souls dissolved in a daring glance.
We wandered out where the night-mists rose
’Round Wunya, down where the Lachlan flows.
I bared my heart and I vowed my love;
And the passioned breath of the night above
Stooped low, and whispered it back to me
Thro’ the maze of a ghostly grey-box tree.
From along the creek came the mopoke’s cry,
Like the wail of a wand’ring soul gone by.
While, low in the west, ’mid a blood-red light,
M> stpx sank down to the depths of night.
Ani I shuddered there, where the death-weed
grows
At Wunya, down where the Lachlan flows.
Our life was a wondrous hymn of praise ;
Our loving the wine of drunken days.
I flung my soul to her soft white hands.
And wrapt my heart in a lover’s bands.
I dragged myself in the mire of earth,
And played the fool for her silly mirth.
For she was cruel as women are—
I called her my queen and my guiding star.
And I pray that her paltry conscience knows
Of the life she damned where the Lachlan flows.
She was fair as false, and as false as fair,
For her face was lit with the beauty rare
Of olden days when the world was young,
And saint-faced maidens their favors flung
To the gallant knights as they rode to fight
For the joy of war, and the 1 ve of right.
She held my soul in her hands, and said
That she’d play me true —and our hearts were wed.
But—lia-ho ! —lie-lie !—’tis my heart now goes
To the dancing shed where the Lachlan flows.
The fire is low, and the night is cold,
And the world is stale, and I’m growing old.
So I end my dreaming, and take this curl
That I stole from the head of that lovely girl;
And her scented notes, and her withered flowers
With mem’ries sweet of those wicked hours;
And thrust them deep in the dying fire,
And make of them all a fun’ral pyre.
For she married the clod and a life of prose,
In Wunya, down where the Lachlan flows.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TWO persons—a man and a girl—sat arguing
in low tones across a supper-table in a
restaurant. A weary waitress, dark and
pouchy under the eyes, stood waiting to pounce
on them with a ticket when they showed signs of
moving. She wasn’t in the least curious about
their affairs, though this was the fourth evening
in succession that they had talked earnestly over
the same table in precisely the same way. The
man —Arthur Linton—did not seem to the
waitress particularly interesting. The girl—
Dorothy Bell —was not one of those costly,
mysterious creatures whose jewellery roused the
waitress’s envy so much that she hated their
laughter. Dorothy had worn the same hat each
evening, and the hat was an old one. There was
nothing dramatic about the way in which the two
behaved. They held the same suppressed, urgent
conversation; ended it by shrugging their
shoulders ; and went away talking lightly and
casually.
In fact, the waitress was right in taking little
interest in them, for the theme of their talk was
in no way original. Linton, living more or less
comfortably on the third floor of a huge building,
which paid bigger insurance premiums because it
offered “residential chambers” as well as
“ business offices,' 1 wanted to persuade Dorothy
that this would be a happy sort of existence for her
too. Dorothy, who worked hard for her living all
day long, paid for her lodgings with an unpleasant
aunt who owned a large, aniemic family of boys
and girls. Probably Dorothy was in love with
Linton—at any rate, she was discontented enough to
be sure that she was. She resisted his sugges-
tions ; partly because, like all girls, she had been
brought up to believe that to retain possession of
herself was virtue, and partly from the instinct
which makes women hesitate at accepting any
proposal, for fear that they may somehow be
missing a better bargain. Yet if the waitress had
listened to their conversation, she would have
given Linton a prophecy of success. For Dorothy
came back every evening to be argued with.
There was a special reason for Dorothy’s dis-
content just now. For a year the unpleasant aunt
had allowed her a room to herself. In that
sanctuary she could stand before a long mirror
and appraise the value of all her beauty. But
now her aunt had begun to take other lodgers,
and she was forced to share a room with
Kathleen, her cousin. Kathleen, bony and ugly-
skinned, always slipped furtively from her clothing
to her night-gown, and looked with scared
eyes at Dorothy’s reckless way of getting ready
for bed. Moreover, Kathleen had a post-nasal
growth; she slept with her mouth open, and
snored. But this was not the worst.
One of the horrors of Dorothy’s childhood had
been eucalyptus oil. The unpleasant aunt had
anointed her with it, had poured it into her
stomach on every possible occasion. The mere
thought of its vapor sickened her. Kathleen, a
dutiful daughter, clung to the eucalyptus tradi-
tion ; and Dorothy, after crawling into bed with
her cousin, would lie sick and suffocating.
Arthur Linton, secretly dismissed at the street
corner for fear of the unpleasant aunt, had on this
fourth night gone home. Dorothy tramped
straight to her bedroom. On the chair before the
long mirror Kathleen was sitting, clutching her
nightgown round her thin breast even in the soli-
tary room, and with oily forefingers rubbing,
rubbing at her neck. Dorothy fell on the bed
and began to laugh.
“ What is the matter ? I wish I could under-
stand you,” Kathleen said, talking more through
her nose than ever.
The other girl laughed more and more. She
stopped, and stood up. “ This room stinks,” she
said; “I’m going out —to post a letter.” She
seized her cousin, who smelt like a thousand gum
leaves, and shook her.
“ Damn you, Kathleen,” she said viciously, and
ran out of the room. Kathleen, being foolish, sat
in front of the long mirror, and cried weakly.
She fell asleep waiting for Dorothy to come back.
* * « *
Nothing but the thought of a railway time-table
was worrying Linton as he sat in his shirt sleeves,
gently rubbing at a tan boot with a piece of
flannel. A soft knock came at his door.
“ You sweet little girl, what made you come
after all ?” he asked her. Dorothy laughed again.
In a month or so it would be time enough to tell
him about the eucalyptus.
“ Wash your hands,” she said. “ I don’t like
the smell of that boot-polish.”
• * * *
“ My wife has come to live with me,” Linton
shouted next day into the deaf ears of old Alt-
mayer, the caretaker. Altmayer nodded, and
shrugged his shoulders. No doubt Mrs. Alt-
mayer would hint other things in their confidential
talks, but both he and she knew exactly how far
they were responsible for the morals of the building.
Gentlemen visited by stray ladies, or ladies visited
by stray gentlemen —Altmayer could deal with
them without mercy. But if Mr. Linton chose
to be married, and to want an extra sitting-room,
what then ? He smiled benignantly, and offered
congratulations. It was not his place to tell the
landlords that the new wife came at midnight,
without a trousseau.
So Linton lived for a fortnight, almost always
in his rooms, and Dorothy decided that she had
not over-estimated her power of holding a man.
At the end of a fortnight Linton got drunk. He
got drunk with the fierce enthusiasm of a man
who hasn’t intended to do it, but having done it,
thinks he had better do it thoroughly. He was
still exalted by his triumph in love. So being
drunk, he was arrogant and aggressive. He
went home with many bruises, for you cannot
assume possession of a disreputable street from
midnight till 3 a.m. without finding violent
trouble. As he walked softly into his room he
realised that next day his bruises would be very
sore.
Dorothy, who had fallen asleep while still
uncertain whether to leel murderous or to cry,
was suddenly beset by horrible dreams. She was
again in bed with Kathleen, who was strangling
her with bony fingers. Her last convulsion was
just beginning. With a choked cry she sat up,
wide awake. In front of a long wardrobe mirror
Linton stood rubbing, rubbing, rubbing with
something that he poured on his fingers from a
hideous bottle.
For ten minutes Linton, dull and hazy-headed,
was in the grip of a cyclone. A fury in a white
nightgown attacked him with a soaking sponge.
He was mauled, splashed, scrubbed, rubbed and
dried. The white nightgown dragged a drawer
to the floor, and assaulted him with bottles of
sharp perfume. He was disinfected with eau-de-
Cologne, and pushed heavily into bed.
A window flew up ; something glittered in the
air, and smashed on the roadway. A cat put its
nose to the new object, and stepped back daintily,
disgusted by the fumes. Linton lay asleep, while
Dorothy leaned over him, with nausea and amuse-
ment fighting for mastery in her face. Finally
she slipped down to his side. His mouth was open,
and he snored.
“ Good-night, Kathleen,” she murmured,
putting her face against his.
PRIAM.
The Failure.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I TAKE my mothers letter to the park every
day, and think, and think. She says how
much they miss me, how much they want
me back, and they talk of the green plains, and the
sweet old garden, and the larks along the creek.
Down at the end are some words about being
resigned, and the Hand of God in everything.
Resignation ! And I dreamed of Fame. Oh my
voice ! My lost voice ! And my people twelve
thousand miles away. I hear the cow-bells down
the creek, “ tinkle, tonkle,” and the lark in the
morning, and the curlews at night. I shut my
eyes and see the grey plains, the old homestead by
the muddy-watered creek, and under the olean-
ders Jim —and me.
That was before I dreamed of being famous;
but Jim is married now to a girl with money, and
Nell told me once, in awed and underlined sen-
tences, that she always wore silk stockings.
My shoes cost four-and-eleven, and my hat is a
Leghorn in November. Shall I go back, a
failure ?
The old home was too far back and times were
too hard for me to be decently educated. If I
stayed here I could be a housemaid or a shopgirl.
Perhaps in time I might marry a grocer or an
undertaker. . . .
And the future my voice promised —it is gone,
and nothing remains but going back.
Shall Igo ? Back to the old home and the old
people, back to Nell and the boys, back near Jim
• —and Jim’s wife.
My shoes cost four-and-eleven, and her stock-
ings—what a fool I am !
Oh, my Voice ! Oh, Jim !
I wonder !

CONFIDENCE is not won in a day. This
truth applies/with special force to
proprietary medicines. Countless pre-
parations have been placed on the
market during: the fifty years
that have been tried and found want-
ingr. They could not establish their
claims. Their bid for public confi-
dence was made under false pre-
tences of merit. They were without
value and they failed! BEECHAM’S
FILLS have been before the public for
over half a century. They have grown
in public favor owing: to their merit.
Now they have a sale of over
6,000,000 Boxes Annually
the largest sale of any patent medi-

claimed for Beecham's Pills and they

exaggeration in the statement that
they cure all forms of Indigestion,
