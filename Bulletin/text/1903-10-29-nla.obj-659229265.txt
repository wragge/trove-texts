A SONG AGAINST LOVE.
There is a thing in the world that has been since the
world began :
The hatred of man for woman, the hatred of woman for
man.
When shall this thing be ended ? When love ends, hatred
ends.
For love is a chain between foes, and love is a sword
between friends.
Shall there never be love without hatred ? Not since the
world began,
Until man teach honour to woman, and woman teach
pity to man.
0 that a man might live his life for a little tide
Without this rage in his heart, and without this foe at his
side !
He could eat and sleep and be merry and forget, he could
live well enough,
Were it not for this thing that remembers and hates, and
that hurts and is love.
But peace has not been in the world since love and the
world began.
For the man remembers the woman, and the woman
remembers the man.
ARTHUR SYMONS
in The Athenaeum.
A LESSON FOR RHYMERS
The section “In Hospital: 1873-75” of W. E.
Henley’s Poems (1898) is based on a series of
sonnets called “ Hospital Outlines: Sketches and
Portraits,” addressed from “ Royal Infirmary,
Edinburgh.” and printed in No. 187 of The
Comhill Magazine (July, 1875). Comparison of
Henley’s earlier and later methods is profitable.
Here, first, are the Comhill sonnets not included
in the Poems.
FLORAL.
Broad through the open door there stole to me
Homesick and tired, a sudden smell of flowers:
A memory of mists, and suns, and showers,
Borne beautiful among my reverie.
Two girls came in. They carried, fair to see,
The homely growths of autumn, sweets and sours.
With waifs and strays of summer’s golden hours
Tied up in little nosegays daintily.
To each of us they gave, as, week by week,
Nature’s cheap gems among the hurt and sick.
With kindest instinct beautiful they share ;
And when they left the close infirmary reek,
A sweet abnormal savour lingered there
Of sunburnt green, clear space, and country air.
See now, young rhymers, how badly another
young rhymer can write and live to be honoured
as poet! This sonnet holds a pleasant sentiment,
but the lines are stiff and lifeless. The first three
of the sestet are so very bad that one wonders
Henley tnssed them even in 1875. Mark ab-
normal —like an excrescence. Probably it repre-
sents the budding of Henley’s zeal for the
precious word, often an excrescence.
The next is irregular and neater; but it is of
no account, and has been omitted rightly—
A STUDENT.
A little black man, admirably neat,
Extremely “ gentleman "from head to foot,
All glossy hat, white shirt, and shiny bnof.
Gold links and chain, and ’kerchief smelling sweet.
H» soaks his hair in water till the curl
Peculiar to his race will smooth away.
And visits his moustaches day by day,
Though yet, in this respect, a very girl.
His traits ?—resentful and suspicious vanity,
Shoivy dexterity, logical humanity ,
Thin brilliance, commonplace intelligence.
And, over all, unquenchable, immense,
Alert to smile and bow, to watch and wait,
An egotism making these things great.
Next is a deft bit of character : with the rhymes
right’t would pass muster with some included in
the Poems —
A PATIENT.
John Gallagher— “ Mad Jack ’’—from Donegal,
Aged fiiie-and-forty ; reaper, shearer, sinker,
Adores Saint Blackthorn, is a furious drinker,
And, to the priest, a very sheep withal ;
Has tramped through Britain, can the route recall;
Believes in ghosts, but in his way’s a thinker ;
Once threw a tinker's baby at the tinker ;
Holds Willie Wallace first of heroes all.
Fell, eighteen months ago, some thirty feet,
Smashing his shin. The cure’s almost complete t
And lusty still, save when the surgeon eyes him,
He like a collier swears, prays like a child,
Roars like a bison, laughs like something wild,
And makes us all like, pity, and despise him.
. The fourth is another stiff one ; but it could
have been re-written—
ANOTHER (Night Picture].
Round one poor bed is stretched the painted screen,
Whose leaves extemporise a decent gloom,
Where Death and Life, as in a private room,
Meet, and arrange the honours of the scene.
The shadows melt into the growing grey ;
The gas burns pale. My thoughts are gruesome yet,
But my vague sense of impotent regret
Fades in my pipe's blue tender whorls away.
Before the creaking fire the widow cries.
Huddled and hushed; the fresh, young night-nurse
dozes ;
We talk by fits, or think—for in this wise
A gaunt Perhaps itself to us discloses;
And 10, the sun 1 strong for his new emprise,
All Hope and Health, superb with wild mist roses.
The Comhill series consists of eighteen sonnets.
Four of these are not included in Poems. The
later pieces in Poems are “Operation,” “Etching,”
“Casualty,” “ A ve, Caesar ! ” “House-Surgeon,”
“Interlude,” “Romance,” “Pastoral,” “Music,”
“Suicide,” “Apparition,” “ Anterotics,” “Noc-
fcurn,” “Discharged,” and “Envoy.”
Several of the fourteen preserved sonnets are
recast entirely. “Night Picture,” for example,
becomes “ Vigil ”in this fashion. Runs the first
quatrain of the original—
Implacable, the speck of gas compels
My fascinated eyes, and makes them sore ;
Perverse, the bedclothes ramble, more and more ;
Like rockery the mattress sinks and sivells.*
In Poems this is turned—
... Shoulders and loins
Ache /
Ache, and the mattress,
Run into boulders and hummocks,
Glows like a kiln, while the bedclothes —
Tumbling, importunate, daft —
Ramble and roll, and the gas.
Screwed to its lowermost.
An inevitable atom of light,
Haunts .,.
Both statements are stiff; and in the last version
Henley’s mouthing mode fails to justify itself, as
often.
. Generally, the root and value of the matter is
in the old version, while the new version benefits
by elder and better taste. Here is the fifth sonnet
m The Comhill —
BEFORE OPERATION.
Behold me gruesome, waiting for the knife I
A little while, and at a leap I storm
The thick sweet mystery of chloroform,
The drunken dark, the little Death-in-life.
The gods are good to me : I have no wife.
No helpless child, to think of as I near
The fateful minute ; nothing all too dear
Unmans me for my hour of passive strife.
Yet am I tremulous and someivhat sick;
And, face to face with chance, I shrink a little.
My hopes are strong, but ah t my will is weak,
Here comes the basket. Euge 1 lam ready.
But, gentlemen my porters, life is brittle;
You carry Ccesar and his fortune—steady 1
In Poems this is—
BEFORE.
Behold me waiting—waiting for the knife.
A little while, and at a leap 1 storm
The thick, sweet mystery of chloroform,
The drunken dark, the little death-in-life.
The gods are good to me : 1 have no wife,
No innocent child, to think of as I near
The fateful minute ; nothing all-too dear
Unmans me for my bout of passive strife,
Yet am I tremulous and a trifle sick,
And, face to face with chance, I shrink a little ;
My hopes are strong, my will is something weak.
Here comes the basket ? Thank you. lam ready.
But, gentlemen my porters, life is brittle .-
You carry Ccesar and his fortunes—steady 1
Note the changes.
In the title: Operation is understood, and super-
fluous. Before alone is more significant, more
grim: it holds the weight and emotion of the
naif-word.
Line 1: Gruesome is not the right word; it is a
light word in any case: it does not hold pain
or dread. The doubled waiting increases
expectancy. The somewhat hysterical note of
exclamation is properly changed for the solemn
full-stop. As one’s sense of punctuation deve-
lops, the exclamation-point becomes singularly
1 oud and garish. To use it often in good work
shows a want of subtility. Besides, Henley wants
to close with an exclamation inline 14, where it
comes properly to enforce an image of action;
and, given one exclamation in fourteen lines,
every other that you add lessens the effect of that
one. Nurse your climax.
Lanes 3 and 4 —good lines—he cannot improve
upon. But he has reduced Death to death : since,
after all, death is life’s equal, no more.
Line 6 : “No helpless child ” becomes “ no'inno-
cent child.” The change lifts the rhythm, and
avoids jarring with the impression of the helpless
man about to face chloroform.
Line 7 : all too becomes all-too. This is debat-
able : Henley wished to make the meaning clearer
and also to assist the reader .in stressing the line
as Henley meant it.
Line 8: bout replaces hour, to suit Henley’s
later taste. A bad line anyway.
Lina 9: a trifle for somevjhat — partly for
rhythm and partly because something takes the
place of but ah ! —a distinct weakness in line 11.
Why weakness ? Because it is clearly an eking
out, a filling up; and the mood of but ah ! does
not chime with the mood of the piece : the emotion
spills on a false note.
Line 12 : English Thank you for, Latin Euge !
One should write in due’s language, if one writes
seriously. Besides, Euge ! (“Bravo!” —or “Ex-
cellent, i’ faith!”) delays the impression,: it is
strange to most of us.
Line 14: Fortunes (with the s) is the usual
translation of Plutarch’s phrase, and the s s
(usually harsh) here delays the line—gives pause
for the mind to follow the porters lifting—a
natural pause.
All the changes have not been noted, nor have
those noted been followed all the way. Yet see
how many things a writer must consider, to write
even moderately well!
MARGINALIA
The King arrived on Thursday evening: the
promenade and the collation, laid in a spot all carpeted
with jonquils, passed off admirably. We supped, and
some of the tables were short of roast. This upset Vatel,
the chief cook, who said several times.: “ My honour is
lost. I shall never get over this disaster.” He said to
Gourville : “ My head is swimming ; I have not slept for
the past twelve nights ; help me to give my orders.”
The Prince invited Vatel into his room and said to him :
“ Vatel, all is well : Nothing could have been finer than
the Kind’s supper.” He replied: “ Monseigneur, your
kindness overwhelms me'; L know that at two tables the •
roast fell short.” “Not at all,” said Cond6, “do not
worry yourself, all is going nicely.”
Midnight arrived ; the fireworks veere not a success, for
they were envelopedin a cloud ; they cost sixteen thou-
sand francs. At four o’clock in the morning Vatel made
a round, found all asleep, and met a smalltradesman who
brought him only two"Wads of sea-fish ; he waited for
some time ; he became very excited, thinking that this
much was all the fish he would have ; he went and found
Gourville, and said to him ; “ Monsieur, I shall never
recover from this disgrace,”
Vatel went upstairs to his room, placed his sword
against the door, and rah himself through the heart, but
only after three attempts. Meanwhile sea-fish was arriv-
ing in quantities ; the servant were seeking Vatel to
distribute it : someone went up to his room, knocked at
the door, opened it. and found him bathed in his blood.
The Prince was in despair.
However, Gourville did his best to make up fhr the
loss of Vatel, and succeeded : the dinner was excellent ;
we lunched, supped, went for a walk, played and hunted ;
everything was perfumed with jonquils ; everything was
enchanted. —Letters of Madame de Sevigne (April, 1671),
The story of Don Vincente : The Don, who had
set up as a dealer, though he hated selling, was outbid at
a book auction in Barcelona for a most precious volume
on which he had fixed his heart. Three nights after the
sale, the house of the successful purchaser was seen to be
on fire, and his dead body was afterwards discovered with
money beside it, and With a pipe in Ps hand. Verdict,
accidental death—spark from victim’s jjipe.
A chain of incriminating circumstances led eventually
to the search of the shop of Don Vincente, and to the
finding of the coveted book in a hidden recess. The
culprit confessed himself guilty of assassination, theft,
and arson. At the trial, prisoner’s counsel proved that
there was another copy of the work in the Louvre ; there-
fore, there might be more, and so his client’s prize might
have been lawfully obtained.
At this the Don uttered an agonized cry, “Ah, my
error was clumsy indeed. I am the most miserable of
men.” “ Repentance,” observed the judge by way of
solemn consolation, “ in spite of the enormity of your sin,
is not too late.” “ Ah, Senor Alcalde,” was the answer of
the bibliophile, “ but my copy was not unique.”— Loud.
Standard.
AN IRISH MARK ANTONY.
Mark Antony is dead !—0, let your tears
Fall on the spot
To which have tended his few living years—
The kitchen pot,
Yea, tears are easy at this latter stage,
Preparing onion stuffing mixed with sage.
Mark Antony is dumb l 0, let your mind
Recall his voice !
Its silver cadence, deep and so refined,
Made all rejoice.
Yea, let your tears fall on his life’s brief page
While you prepare his stuffing mixed with sage.
Mark Antony is gone! 0 let your eyes
Look back upon
The memory of his unchastened size Falstaffian
Yea, weep far him, dead at his early age,
While you slice up the onion and the sage.
Mark Antony is dead t 0 let the drums
Beat mournfully,
While to the flames his murdered body comes
On them to lie
Before he goeth, boiled and roasted, hence,
(But not in any Calvinistic sense).
0, beat the drums
And edge the knife,
His lit/tle life
To roasting comes:
0, loving friends
Get knife and fork,
The pig is pork,
And there he ends.

is silent, thinks or speaks or listens, and if is enough.
When she is silent, her face has a mystery which is more
significant than anything she can say : when she speaks,
her voice is like a smile, like a caress, like a person : her
voice is itself a woman.”

The Independent Review, to be published in
London this month, will add to the list a monthly whose
programme looks very like the programme of all the
other monthlies. What we want is a maga. like The Fre*
Review that John M. Robertson edited, dealing frankly
and caustically with social and literary questions, and
leaving heavy politics to the heavy hands busy already..
In The Weekly Critical Review (Paris) of Sept.
17th, Havelock Ellis writes of “Fiction in the Australian
Bush.” “The Australian Bush,” he says, “is full of
exquisite beauty.” “The love of strong sensation which
frequently makes the beginnings of art is not necessarily
morbid, and may only be a sign of young and vigorous
life.” “... when I think of the innumerable traits of
humanity and refinement one meets with throughout the
Bush, I realise that the semi-imbecile swagsman and the
drunken, swearing drover are not the most important
products of Australia, and may even be ignored alto-
gether.” “The special charm of Lawson’s work lies in
its unambitious simplicity and veracity. Dorrington...
has published a volume of short stories, Castro’s Last
Sacrament , which make a higher challenge. Dorrington
is a conscious artist, and knows that a writer
can be great and tragic within small space."
Of the stories: “ Brilliant they certainly are,
and they would be finer still if in his effort to
attain tragic intensity Dorrington had not often fallen
into mere violence." “My Brilliant Career” “is a
vivid and sincere hook”; “but something more than
emotion is needed to make fine literature ; and here we
miss any genuine instinct of art or any mature power of
thought, and are left at the end only with a painful sense
of crudity.” “In . . . the Bush Studies of Barbara
Baynton, we seem to find a writer who, though with
something of the artistic crudity of Miles Franklin, yet
reveals a genuine native force, a more than merely
emotional or temperamental energy, that one is less sure
of in the other young Australian writers of fiction. . . .
A writer who visualises so intensely, almost instinctively,
the scenes she paints, certainly has the makings of a fine
artist.”

commonly intelligent and interesting article by Woods
Hutchinson in Sept. Contemporary.

ELECTRICITY THE CURE.
DOES not every man wish to be strong-, to be able to meet successfully the every day issues of life that occur? This is impossible
when the body is weak, the brain weary, and ability to concentrate the mind is missing. It is the strong man, the man whose
mind is alert, and who is wide awake, who succeeds nowadays. Be at the top! Be as good and better than the next man ! I If you
fe*l that you are run down; that you are weak; if you have tried the OLD AND EVER-FAILING DRUG TREATMENT, give it up. Your body is
like an engine without steam, your nerve force is exhausted, you have no energy, you have no steam.
“Electricity is Life.” It is the potent factor in the human body. Electricity is the only rational and certain cure for functional
disorders. If your BACK ACHES, if you are NERVOUS, if you have
RHEUMATISM, LUMBAGO, INDIGESTION, STOMACH or KIDNEY
TROUBLES, Electricity, properly applied, will cure you. There is no
doubt about it. It cannot fail. It quickens the pulse, invigorates
the blood, puts new life Enlo every nerve.
Beware of Quacks,
THE success and great cures effected
by this Wonderful Electric Belt
and attachments have induced
Quacks and Pretenders to try their hand
at Belt-making. These articles are offered
to the public,for a few shillings as an in-
ducement to sell their drugs. The public
are the best judges of the virtue there
must be in an article anyone can get for
the asking.
We caution everyone not to waste their
money on these articles ; and, moreover,
Drug Treatment is useless for all disorders
of the Nervous System, or Functional
Decay. Electricity alone is the basis qf
all these ailments, and, if it fails, nothing
will cure.

Why take Drugs when you can be CURED BY ELECTRICITY ALONE?
Mr. VICTOR SWANSON, of MT. CROSBY, Nr. IPSWICH, QUEENSLAND, writes: “ Dear Sirs,—l have pleasure in acknowledging that the Electric Belt which I purchased
from you has done what you said it would. Before I bought it, I was so disabled that I was unable to dress myself. Now I will give you an account of the treatment
through which I went before receiving it. I gave Sequar’s remedies a good trial, also Herbal Remedies, was an out-door patient at the hospital for four months; tried
three different patent medicines and linament; placed myself under another doctor’s treatment for two months; had my arms bled, without ary result further than the
loss of blood; gave the Herbal Remedies another trial; tried Turkish and Electric Baths and received no benefit from any, until wearing your Electric Belt for three
months, when, after being in pain for seven years, I was able to do my work with pleasure, and have just completed one mile of fencing. I have pleasure in guaranteeing
this statement to be the truth.”
Mr. R. J. BRAY, of GREEN CULLY, via NEWSTEAD, VIC., writes: “Dear Sirs,—l
beg to reply to yours of the 17th. re Belt. In telling you the truth, I wore your Belt
for six weeks, and I felt that good from it, and knowing that my wife is a great
sufferer from constipation and liver and other ailments, I took it home to try on her. I
fixed it up for her, and she wore it for the first time three weeks ago. Last Sunday
night I received a letter from her, and she tells me she is using the Belt and working
wonderfully. She now enjoys perfect health, which is a thing she has not done
for some years. That pleases me as much as anything. The only thing I regret
that we are not together so that we can both use it; however, she wants it worse than I
do. I will write you again soon, as I want to get the Belt again for it has done me a lot
of good in so short a time.”
A well-known storekeeper in Narromine, who suffered from Rheumatism, etc.,
writes: “ Dear Sirs,—ln reply to your letter of the Bth inst. asking for report as to my
condition. Since givingr your Eelt a fair trial, I am pleased to say that I have derived
great benefit. Since using your Belt the indigestion I have been suffering from has
entirely disappeared, and I am perfectly satisfied that your Belts are genuine and a
wonderful invention.—l am, yours faithfully, “ CHERN LEE.”
Mr. W. J. PARKER, of BLINMAN, S.A., writes : “ Dear Sirs,—lt is a great pleasure
for me to be able to say that the Belt has worked wonders, my hip is quite well, and my
back is better than it has been for a long time. Ido not think I shall require to use the
Belt much longer, as I am pleased to say that I am almost thoroughly restored to
health.”

Without
Operation,
Pain, Danger, Inconvenience, or Loss of Time. A genuine success. IMMEDIATE RELIEF.
The acme of comfort and a feeling of perfect confidence is secured from the first hour of using
Dr. Langston’s combined treatment. Write to-day for Treatise No. 12—posted 2 stamps—and
read the CONVINCING TESTIMONY received from all parts of Australia, from hundreds
of men who HAVE BEEN CURED. Used and endorsed by Clergymen, Statesmen, Lawyers,
Physicians, Farmers, Artisans, Navvies, Miners; in fact, men and women in every station of
life. These living witnesses support facts that leave no room for doubt.
VARICOCELE
CURED—No Cutting or Pain.
The stagnant blood is driven from the dilated veins, and all soreness and swelling subsides.
Men suffering from Weakened Nerve Force, Constant Depression, Gloomy Forebodings, Fast
Becoming Unfitted for Active Business Life, fail to attribute their deplorable state to the
PROPER CAUSE. They know they have VARICOCELE, as they have suffered some dis-
comfort on account of it, particularly while standing. But the evil effects due to
VARICOCELE are so gradual that they neglect it until the entire system is undermined, and
they are forced to realise that something must be done to prevent them from breaking down
completely. To such sufferers I say, Don’t fall into the hands of Quacks—don’t submit
to the knife—don’t pay enormous sums to so-called specialists for medicines, electric belts, etc.
My perfect, simple device will CURE YOU EASILY, Permanently, and Quickly, without
inconvenience or loss of time. Send for Treatise No. 15—posted 2 stamps.

There is this
peculiar thing
about our Hair
Vigor : it’s a hair-
food, not a dye.
It doesn’t turn
your hair e ud-
denly black and
make it look dead
and lifeless. But
gradually the old
color comes back,
all tho rich color it
used to have. And
it also Stops falling
of the hair.
Even if your hair
isn’t coming out,
isn’t turning gray,
isn’t too short,
yet you certainly
want a fine dress-
ing for it, and here
Iyer’s Hair Vigor
It keeps the scalp clean and healthy,
removes all dandruff, makes the hair
grow rapidly, prevents it from falling
out, and does not allow a single gray
liair to appear.
Do not be deceived by cheap imita-
tions which will only disappoint you.
Make sure that you get the genuine

It’s the modem and systematic manner of loading that makes
Winchester Shotgun Cartridges shoot stronger, give better
pattern and penetration and more uniform results generally than
any other makes. No black powder shotgun cartridges compare
with Winchester “New Rival ”in any way; while Winches-
ter “ Repeater ” Cartridges, loaded with smokeless powder, are
far ahead of all other makes, when the price is considered.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
An Old Canoe.
When sea and sky are a violet blue,
And yellow-tail are the gannet’s targe,
I drift away, and I leave no clue,
With pipe and line and a book or two,
Afar from the towzled spray-whipped marge,
And live as the brown and the black men do,
Paddling about in an old canoe.
The tough bark thrills to the rough brown thew
When syrens cling to the singing prow,
The dream-elves, lured from the green purlieu,
Trip down to the wave-lapped sand to woo,
And in the cove there is peace enow.
A man may learn what the Dryads do,
Paddling about in an old canoe.
On red-gold days, with a lust for crew,
I make a mate of a blue-eyed maid,
Her breasts are soft as the mountain dew,
Her smooth arms glow with a nut-brown hue,
And sea-mews flock to her serenade.
O, Faery, know what twain may do,
Paddling about in an old canoe!
The liquid ores of the sky imbue
With thirst for draughts of a vintage fine,
The gum-leaves hush as we lie, perdu,
And soft, red lips in a whisper sue,
And eyelids close with a meed divine.
We live and love as the brown mates do,
Paddling about in an old canoe.
For life is brief, and its fete-days few,
And love and books are the best of all,
A man grows wan in a gilded mew,
His heart and brain take a dank mildew
And at the best he is Fortune’s thrall.
I’d rather drift as the wild men do,
Paddling about in an old canoe.

Back of Your Life.
Toiling away in the country or city
Men of the soil or men of the mart,
Showing no traces of God-given pity,
Schooled till ye manage each beat of the heart.
Sometimes I think ye wear human disguise
Only to trample the weak in your strife,
But I have caughb in a glance of your eyes
Visions of things at the Back of Your Life.
What were ye toiling for ? Rest in the grave ?
That was the end, and it lay at your hand !
Why did ye perjure and steal, scrape and save ?
That was the thing I could not understand !
Till, in that flash from the steel of your eyes,
Snap of your jaws like a sharply-shut knife,
Back, when the fogs broke, I saw the hills rise
Back of Your Life, oh ! Back of Your Life.
Someone —a maid or a matron maybe—
Stands on those hills of the morning and eve;
You are at home with the babes on your knee,
Or she is waving good-bye as you leave.
This is the knowledge that comes in that flash—
Flash that ennobles the murk of the strife ;
Ah ! and ye fling down the half-lifted sash !
Why are ye ’shamed of the Back of Your Life ?

My Lady Moon.
She comes when shadows faintly fall,
And from a throne the evening star,
Old Hesper, draws the cloudy veil
From off her argent features far.
She comes when a low lullaby
The evening breezes softly croon;
Above the world her silver lamp
She raises high—my Lady Moon.
Like some dark beauty of the north,
Pale, oval face and lustrous eyes,
Along her jewelled path of stars
She passeth softly, crescent-wise,
While the dim shadow of her hair
Floats out behind her o’er the skies —
She comes, though bub to vanish soon :
Earth’s eldest daughter—Lady Moon.
I watch for her at eventide,
When hills are grey and shadows tall,
And for my greeting, kiss the beams
That from her bright eyes softly fall;
When the whole world is silver lit,
Those things that I’d not breathe at noon
I whisper softly to my love —
My only love, my Lady Moon.

NEVILLE GOYDER.
The Voice of the Sea.
Over the scream of the storm and droning
Of winds that gather and waves that roar,
That beat like flails on the rocks, and moaning
Cast their dead on the shivering shore ;
High o’er the foam and the green waves leaping,
Borne on the wings of the storm-wind strong,
Rings, with an undertone of weeping,
A mystic cadence of wordless song.
Great, green breakers, recoiling, swelling,
Your salt sea spray cast on seashore lone,
What is the tale that in song you’re telling
While storm-clouds lowerandnight-winds moan?
Oh! long, cold waves, in your rolling splendor,
Bearing the corpses of dead men pale,
Did you kiss them to sleep with a lullaby tender,
Did the dying interpret your hidden tale ?
“ Living or dead, thou shalt not unravel
The age-old song of the waves of God.
From end to end of the world we travel
Farther than footsteps of men have trod.
Little we know of the death we scatter
Round the land where our waters curve,
Little to us do these things matter
Question us not, for we only serve.”

Morbid Months of Misery.
“A DESPAIRING WRECK OF HUMANITY.”
A Great Friend in Time of Need.
Tfie Case of W[r. H. BARNETT,
(by a special reporteb.)
It is worthy of note that the interviews
which have from time to time appeared in
these columns are singularly free from mere
theorising about the subjects dealt with,
and are entirely confined to practical, though
none the less interesting, details, an addition
to which is made by Henry Barnett, of No.
212 James-streeb, Leichhardt.
“ To show what important events iome*
times arise from trivial causes,” said the
gentleman mentioned, “ I must inform you
that one day I scratched my elbow with a
piece of zinc, which was hanging loosely in-
side a waggon. It was nothing to grow
alarmed about, I thought, and I took no
notice of it until the next day, when my
arm appeared to be slightly inflamed, but I
did not take any precaution to stop it get-
ting any worse. Not till a week afterwards
did I bother myself, and by that time my
arm was so much swollen, and the pam was
so intense, that I could not go any longer
without seeking some advice.”
“Where did you go for it?” the repor-
ter enquired.
“ To the hospital, and on three successive
visits my arm was operated upon. It was
then that I realised the great disaster which
had overtaken me, as the doctor said I had
just come in time to save losing my life from
blood poisoning, so by that you will know
that I was in a dreadful state.”
“ Weije you able to attend to your busi-
ness?”
“Work of any description was beyond
my powers for nearly four months, for my
constitution was fairly broken up and I was
almost helpless. This being the first illness
I ever had, you may depend that I felt my
misfortune very keenly, and the thought
that I would never be able to use my arm
again nearly drove me frantic. I sat and
brooded over my troubles till my mind
lapsed into a chronic state of despondency,
and although the doctor said I had come
‘just in time,’ I did not feel so sure about
it, as I felt so generally weak and wretched
that I doubted if I could survive the terrible
calamity which had occurred. For five
days and nights I did not eat a morsel of
food, although I tried hard enough to take
a little nourishment, bub I could not swal-
low what I put to my mouth, and this, to-
gether with the agonising pains I was
suffering, made a thorough wreck of me.
My cruel tortures would not allow me to
sleep, neither did I know which way to lie
for ease, so that when daylight came I was
glad to get up in spit,* of having scarcely
sufficient strength to walk about, for if I
did *nake an attempt my head turned so
giddy that J sew had to sit down again.
My wife was kept going night and day bath-
ing and bandaging my arm, but even the
great care I received and the doctor’s medi-
cines combined could not succeed in elimi-
nating the poison which prevented the
wound from healing. I was completely at
the mercy of my original complaint, which in
time made my recovery more improbable,
because of the ruin it wrought on my in-
ternal organs, and as ailment after ailment
was piled up I saw that jnv prospects were
more gloomy than ever. My nerves were
always on the quiver, which showed that
the strain on my system was too great for
them, and I felt particularly nervous on
hearing any noises, which also grated on my
ears and made me extremely irritable. I
could see that it was no good taking any
more doctor’s medicines, as I. was getting no
benefit from them and they made me feel
sick; besides, they did not help me in re-
gard to my appeiite, so I decided on pur-
chasing some Clements Tonic.”
“ How did that idea originate ?”
“Well, I had taken Clements Tonic to
give me an appetite once before when I was
feeling a bit jaded, and it made me eat like
a horse ; and now that I was so feeble, and
run down as low as I could be, I thought
Clements Tonic might do the same again.
And, upon my word, it did ; hut for a while
I was sorry that Clements Tonic ma ’e me
eat so heartily, as my digestive organs were
in such a shockingly bad state that all food
disagreed with me. My stomach always
got filled with wind, and my chest pains
were %o weighty that I could scarcely get
my breath, while the awful pains L had
hitherto been maddered with were ad cd
to by something gidng wrong between my
shoulders. The taste hi my mouth and the
furred condition of my tongue test i tied to
the disordered state of my liver, but the
aches in my limbs and across my loi■ s told
the direful tale that my vita ity w’as per-
fectly exhausted; When I come to look
hack upon those weeks of abject orture and
misery, when I could not even lead for the
swolhn feeling in my eyes, with no anima-
tion in my body, and with no hope left, I
consider it a merciful ♦interposition of
Providence which influenced me to perse-
vere with Clements Tonic, by the aid of
which came a delightful experience 'that
broke the morbid monotony of all Urnse
months. When the frst bottle of Chen cuts
Tonic was finished I was sleeping more
soundly than I had done for some time ; ast,
the reason being that there was a decrease
in the pains which had kept me adutke so
consistently, and how thankful I was for
the rest, too! To find that I could . Ikon
re lief from Clements Tonic gave me a fresh
interest in life, although I did not antici-
pate throwing off my afflictions al ogethcr,
as they had held out so obstinately .'gainst
other medicines ; but I was grateful for all
mercies, and when the discomforts following
my meal 3 were lessened you can imagine
my great surprise* Little by little my
strength returned, and the vitalizing pro-
perties of Clements Tonic came in evidence
by the gradual healing of the wound in my
atm, and now there is nothing but a scar to
show where it was opened. I had lost a
considerable amount of flesh doting my
illness, but in a few weeks it was all re-
stored, so it is needless to say that < lemeuts
Tonic put my digestive organs in thorough
order, besides infusing so much power to my
nervous system that you could not have got
a tremble out of my nerves no matter how
you might have Before long I had
shaken off every pain that had tormented me,
and with the full complement of sttength
which Clements Tonic restored to my sys-
tem, I went back to work none the worse

Wore a Torture
BELT.
SUFFERED TERRIBLE AGONY.
From wearing an Electric Belt
charged by the use of
SULPHURie Tie ID.
Mr. W. Folley, Alfred Woollen Mills,
Williamstown, Vic., writing to the Dr.
McLaughlin Electric Belt Co., tells how he
was scarred and burned by the use of a
Free Belt, which he had erroneously
been led to believe was as good as theirs.
He paid £\ for the Free Belt because
he had been convinced that by paying
this cash price he was obtaining a similar
appliance to Dr. McLaughlin’s Famous
rejuvenator which has gained World
Wide fame as a Curative Agent. It goes
to show how misleading are advertise-
ments which seem to offer something for
nothing.
Gentlemen—ln answer to your kind in-
quiries after my health, I beg to state that
I have been completely cured of the Scia-
tica that has troubled me for years. I
cannot thank you enough for your gentle-
manly treatment and fair dealing with your
patients, as I know from others that their
treatment has been the same as mine.
I may just as well let you know my ex-
perience in seeking a cure for my trouble
before I purchased one of your High Grade
Belts. I had been under doctors and re-
ceived scant relief; and also tried various
quacks, but it was all the same. I then
placed myself in the hands of a Specialist
(in Melbourne) guaranteed to cure Rheu-
matism and Sciatica, but received very
small benefit from the treatment. I then
had my attention drawn to Electricity.
Well, I thought, “ Never venture, never
win,” so I PROCURED first of all a Belt
for £1 and was very much disappointed
because I was informed that it was neces-
sary to take a long and exceedingly ex-
pensive course of drug treatment. I would
not do this and then I wrote for, and ob-
tained a so-called Free Belt , with a
most “ Wonderful Pedigree,” at a cost of
£4. I wore the Belt according to the in-
structions given faithfully for a period of
five weeks, and by that time I was Burnt
and Blistered so badly that I could not
wear it longer, and still no relief was
gained, although the Belt was guaranteed
to Cure Anything in Sciatica in One
Month. You bet I was very much dis-
couraged in regard to Electric Belts.
However, I was persuaded to come and
iust see you, gentlemerT I then found
that I had been wearing a' Torture Belt
and very Wrongly Applied, and quite
enough to give and patient a Horror of
so-calle d Electric Belts. After the con-
sultation I decided to place myself in your
hands. I knew my case was very diffi-
cult, as I was compelled to follow my em-
ployment, and standing at the vice was
irksome, and the complaint was a very
stubborn one. However, gentlemen, your
Belt, coupled with your advice, has made
me a grateful patient. I thank you kindly
for supplying me with a remedy which has
Completely Cured Me, and strongly recom-
mend it to all and sundry that I find are
suffering from the distressing malady
called “ Sciatica.” . . ..
I have not been wearing the Belt for the
past fortnight, but have passed it over to
my wife, who has received great benefit
for nervous troubles.'
I remain, your grateful patient,

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 29, 1903.
The Australian Capital.
The Australian Parliament has closed up, leaving
the capital question still unsettled. It was im-
possible, under the circumstances, to do anything
else. The Constitution provides a method for
settling deadlocks between the two Houses by a
joint sitting, but the same deadlock must arise
twice, there must be a dissolution of both Houses,
next another attempt at agreement, and only then
the remedy of the joint sitting becomes available.
Therefore, in laying the matter aside, the Deakin
Government did the only thing that the case
admitted. All the same, a vast amount of wild
and whirling vituperation has been wasted over
the matter, and a small and noisy crowd of Sydney
importers has been bellowing bitterly about “con-
spiracy ” and other public jim-jams. Under these
circumstances it is interesting to briefly review the
case from the beginning, and see how it arrived at
this stage, and especially to note how the malign
and incapable figure of George Reid has wan-
dered like an evil influence through the negotia-
tions from first to last.
***■.*
It was New South Wales, under Parkes, which
moved in the matter of Federation a dozen years
ago, and it was also New South Wales which
dropped the business after a conference had been
held and a Constitution prepared. It was New
South Wales again, under Reid, which moved in
the matter in 1895, and then things drifted along
gradually till a Convention, in the main elected by
the people, met and drafted a Constitution. The
Constitution which the people’s representatives
drafted left the question of the capital quite open,
and in those days the feeling that Sydney would
be the capital was very general. The new Aus-
tralian Constitution, drafted by the people’s repre-
sentatives, was to be submitted to the people for
acceptance or rejection. In the original agree-
ment it was to be held to be accepted so far as
New South Wales was concerned if it received
a majority of the votes cast, and if the 5 vote for
acceptance was not less than 50,000 strong. So
far all was clear. ' ' e
* * *
But George Reid, then Premier- of New
South Wales, had developed into a soured and
grumpy man. Barton had led the Convention
Barton and others had completely overshadowed
lnm. It was essential to a man who wanted
to ba top dog,” to use his own expression,
that he should brush away Barton and the
Barton Bill; that he should secure the Bill’s
rejection and thereby show who ran New
South Wales ; that he should get some alteration
made that would .transpose the Barton Bill into
a Reid Bill; that lie should get that accepted
and thereby show again who ran New South
Wales ; and that the proceedings should terminate
with a great firework display showing George
Reid bringing about the triumphant union of
Australia. So, to begin with, the New South
Wales Parliament, under Reid’s guidance
was allowed to commit a shameful breach
of faith, and bring down on itself the con-
tempt of all Australia, by changing the 50,000
minimum vote required to secure acceptance to an
80,000 minimum— Reid him.elf, as is usual with
him, voting both “ Yes ” and “No” at different
stages of the measure. Then George Reid, as
Premier of New South Wales, started a furious
anti-Bill campaign. It was directed almost
wholly at the Braddon clause of the original
measure—the one which, most wisely, provided
that three-fourths of the customs and excise
revenue should be handed over to the States while
they retained their separate debts, or applied in
payment of the interest on those debts when the
Commonwealth took them over. This is the
clause which principally stands between the
States and insolvency, and it is difficult to see why
it was singled out for special vituperation, unless
it was simply that something had to be vitupe-
rated in the process of getting the Barton Bill
rejected. The Reid anti-Bill campaign was a
great and bitter upheaval, and it ended in awful
disaster. New South Wales scorned Reid and
his campaign, and gave a solid majority for
the old Bill after all, and it was only lost in a
technical way because the “Yes” vote, though a
majority, did not represent quite 80,000 suffrages.
* * * »
When George Reid struggled from under the
debris of the first Referendum and got the dust of
battle out of his hair, he was in a pitiable situation.
He had to hunt up the other Premiers and ask
them to alter a Bill with which the majority of
his own voters had declared themselves fully satis-
fied. He had to ask for alterations which his own
people said they didn’t want. He had to assure
the other Premiers that if they gave him some
kind of alteration—any kind of alteration so long
as he could go back with what professed to be a
new Bill in his hand, and say to his people “Look
at the concessions I have gained for you !”
he would be honest this time, and keep faith, and
not make any more laws requiring an absurd
minimum vote. He went to meet the other
Premiers as the badlv-licked representative of a
minority and the despised individual who couldn’t
be trusted to observe a solemn obligation. Natur-
ally, as the Reid campaign against the Bill had
been almost wholly one long bitter denunciation
of the Braddon clause, the first question which
the other Premiers asked was: “What do you
propose instead of the Braddon clause ? ” And it
was curiously characteristic of the man’s mental
vacuity that, amid all his denunciations of the
Braddon clause, George Reid had never devised
anything to replace it. A wild, soared, broken-up
man had at last to declare himself satisfied with
the clause that had been the centre of his frothy
denunciations—the thing which he had howled
down as insane, unworkable and utterly corrupt —
and to admit that it was the best clause that could
be devised. This left him with no real grievance
and nothing to ask for. But it was necessary to
take back something from Melbourne—a dis-
advantage or a bruise or a blackened eye
or something. The exploded political balloon
couldn’t return to advocate exactly the same
measure that he had denounced, nor to re-
ject Federation altogether, and declare all his
great scheme a failure, and then be kicked
out of office by the pro-Bill majority that he had
insulted and disfranchised. So he came back with
the proviso that, though the capital would be in
New South Wales—a matter which would pro-
bably have happened in any case—yet it must be
100 miles or any greater distance from Sydney ;
that an almost, unlimited area, from 100 square
miles upwards, of New South Wales territory,
must be ceded to the Commonwealth for the pur-
poses of a Federal capital; and that the Parlia-
ment must hold its early sittings in Melbourne.
And George Reid went home, a sadly discredited
and torn individual, trying to look like a man who
brought with him great plunder, and with only
his ineffable cheek to pull him through.
* * * *.
New South Wales accepted the measure again.
If there is anything in it disadvantageous to New
South Wales that State can only regard it as the
fitting reward of its degradation in having a
Reid as its political head. He had to return
with something, even if the thing he brought
back was worse than the thing he took away ;
he had to bring back something, and say it
was the thing he went for ; and, as the repre-
sentative of a beaten minority, lie wasn’t in a
position to exact terms. A picturesque vengeance
fell on him promptly. His wobbling line of action
postponed the beginning of the Commonwealth ;
during the period of delay thus caused, his Minis-
try fell over a sordid question of making un-
authorised payments to a virulent anti-Federalist;
and the offer of the position of first Premier of all
Australia went to Reid’s successor, Bile Lyne,
and was passed on by him to Barton. And
Reid, the man who couldn’t go straight even
when honesty paid best, has been a fading and
disappointed quantity ever since.
•*- * •
When the Australian Parliament set to work to
select an Australian capital, it adhered strictly to
the conditions which George Reid, during his
pathetic struggles to “save his face” at the
Premiers’ Conference of February, 1899, had
succeeded in getting Reid had suc-
ceeded in getting Sydney disqualified, so the
Parliament ignored Sydney of necessity. He had
made a brilliant arrangement by which the Aus-
tralian Parliament might demand 300,000 square
miles of New South Wales—all New South Wales,
in fact, outside the 100 miles limit-from Sydney—
as a Federal territory ; the Australian Parliament
was studiously moderate, and the largest area that
was even mentioned was 5000 square miles, while
the area demanded was only 1000 square miles.
The New South Wales Government had appointed
a Commissioner of its own to select a site, and he
selected Eden-Bombula as far the best one avail-
able. The Senate, in which the N.S.W. vote is
far weaker than in the House of Representa-
tives, accepted the New South Wales Com-
missioner’s report in full, and voted for the
site the New South Wales authority had recom- -
mended. And the deadlock arose because the
New South Wales members in the House of*
Representatives voted almost solidly against a
the acceptance of their own State Commissioner’s
report, and against the site which he declared to?
be by far the best. Also a section of the Neiy'
South Wales press howled in the background- -
because Sydney, which its own Premier had -§.o
carefully got disqualified, was not chosen; because
the condition which he had so carefully got
inserted, that the capital must be over 100 miles
from Sydney, was strictly adhered to; because
the Australian Parliament demanded one three-
hundredth part of the area that he had managed,
with so much trouble, to authorise it to demand.
Also, wild attempts were made to depart from the
letter of the compact, on the ground that the
“intentions of the framers of the Constitution”
were that the 100 miles distance Horn Sydney,
and the 100 square miles area, though each de-
scribed as a minimum, were meant to represent a
maximum—which, considering that 45 out of the
50 “framers of the Constitution” weren’t even
consulted about the new clause, was distinctly
a failure. And Reid himself raged somewhere
in the backblocks of the battle, denouncing his
own arrangement as a “Victorian conspiracy.”
Altogether it has been a curious complication.
At all events, something has been done. A joint
sitting of the two Houses of the Australian Par-
liament must lead to a decision. Before that joint
sitting can be held there must be two dead-
locks ; then a dissolution of both Houses, then
another deadlock. One stage of the business has
been got over —the first deadlock is finished and
done with. In a State Parliament the time spent
over the abortive Bill of last session would be
lost ; in the Australian Parliament it isn’t lost —
it is a definite step towards settlement. Mean-
while the capital question will figure largely in
the coming election. The party which favors
Eden-Bombala is adhering to the letter and spirit
of the Constitution, and is also paying New South
Wales the compliment of adhering to the site
which that State’s own special Commissioner has
selected as being the best availab e. The Tumut
and Lyndhurst parties rave wildly about the
conditions that the New South Wales Premier
exacted as the price at which his State would
federate and the rec unmendations of the New
South Wales Commissioner, as being in some wild,
weird fashion a “Victorian conspiracy.” A great
effort is obviously preparing to wallop into fury
the old parish pump animosities, and the im-
porters of Sydney have a pitiable but incoherent
tale of wrong to tell. But, meanwhile, the Aus-
tralian Parliament sits in Melbourne, as the
result ,of George Reid’s hideously clumsy
gerrymandering of the original Constitution Bill
five years ago ; it will sit in Melbourne, solely by
reason of George Reid’s doings, till a capital is
decided upon ; it won’t come to Sydney at any
time, solely by reason of George Reid’s brilliant
muddling ; and if the Tumut push and the Lynd-
hurst push keep the deadlock going, and if the
State Parliament starts a deadlock of its own by
refusing to give a reasonable area to build the
capital upon, the stay of the Australian Parlia-
ment in Melbourne may be a very long one.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Wanted—A Freetrade Leader Who Doesn’t
Find His Creed Too Dirty to be Practised.
Old Edward Braddon, who is supposed to be
an enthusiastic Freetrader, and occasionally leads
the Freetrade party in the Representatives,
helped the other day at a meeting at Launceston,
called to fix up things in the Freetrade interest for
the coming election. Braddon, the Freetrader,
was Premier of Tasmania for years, and all that
time he found his fiscal creed too loathsome to prac-
tice and too disastrous to associate with. He was
pot even found dead along with it. Premier
Braddon was never on speaking terms with Free-
trade in practical politics. He protected prac-
tically everything, and the amount of money he
sacrificed in some cases, by not raising the excise
rates to the level of the customs duties so as to fur-
nish Tasmania with the blessings of free compe-
tition, was very great. If Premier Braddon
really believed in Freetrade all these years, then
his conduct in wantonly injuring Tasmania with
heavy Protection was treacherous and disgrace-
ful. Can’t the Freetrade party find even one
leader who has shown the courage of his convic-
tions—not his convictions in the police court, but
the other kind ? Australia has had Braddon,
the Freetrader, who protected everything ; and
M‘Millan and Bruce Smith and Carhuthers
and Gould and Pumpkin Smith and Sunday
Brunker, all ardent Freetraders of the Parkes
Freetrade Ministry, who protected nearly every-
thing; and Reid and Carhuthers and Sunday
Brunker and Lee and Potato Young and
Bumpkin Smith and Joe Cook, of the Reid Free-
trade Ministry, who protected a good lot of
things. Now it has Reid, the ardent Freetrade
leader, who says that if he gets into office he
will not interfere too much with the present
Protectionist tariff; and among all the Free-
traders who are drivelling behind him, the one man
who is willing to practise real Freetrade, and thus
fill the country with prosperity, and show that he
doesn’t find his alleged creed too brutal and
callous and disastrous for daily use, hasn’t become
apparent. Yet it is such an easy creed to practise
—if Reid and Braddon and the two Smiths and
Joe Cook only believed in it. You put customs
duties, say, on tea, beer, wine, spirits, tobacco,
and a few other things. You put exactly equal
excise duties on the local products. You charge
the same postage on local as on foreign papers,
and the same railway freights and wharfage dues
on local as on foreign produce. You give all
Government contracts to the lowest tenderer,
J*e he foreign or local. Thus you have the
equired revenue ; the beautiful, bracing breeze of
free competition blows on everybody; nobody is
coddled ; there are no artificial or hot-house indus-
tries ; and General Prosperity sets in immediately.
Isn’t there one Freetrader in all the gang of
frauds who will stand by his creed and vote for
having General Prosperity immediately ?

The Australian Parliament*
The first Australian Parliament goes to the elec-
tors with a record which surpasses in merit that
of any previous Legislature on this continent.
True that it has not done all that was expected
or hoped of it; no human institution ever does.
But, in establishing a White Australia, in setting
up absolutely the most liberal electoral system
of the world, and j.n making a stand against the
Australian disease of borrowing, the Common-
wealth Parliament has done three great works.
In addition, it has set going most of the
necessary machinery of the Constitution—the
only important exception being the failure to
appoint a High Commissioner—and it has passed,
in the face of the bit.terly unpatriotic opposition
of the foreign shoddy party, a tariff which, though
weak and faulty in many respects, still gives some
Protection to the Australian worker against cheap
labor competition. The Senate has proved the
more radical and national of the Houses
of the Australian Legislature. In the House
of Representatives there exists still—though not
to so marked an extent as at the opening of
Parliament—the petty provincial feeling of the
parochialist. Members have not yet fully
appreciated the faet that they are repre-
sentatives of, and. for, Australia —not of
Bathurst or Tumut or Kyabram. The Senate
has, however, “found itself” already, and
the national as opposed to the provincial
spirit is uppermost in its debates. Among the
parties, the conspicuously best record is that of
the Latior party. To that organisation Australia
owes the fact that the Commonwealth Parliament
is not a borrowing Parliament, and much else of
the good work,-affirmative and negative, of the
Barton Administration. In only one respect was
the Labor party disappointing—in its tariff
attitude, or rather its lack of a definite attitude
on the tariff issue. Had the Labor party been
solid for Protection —as a high-wage, anti-sweating
party must logically’be—the tariff wall against
cheap foreign labor would have been higher
and the avenues for the employment of our
o.vn workers more numerous. Even with that
exception, the work of the Labor party was such
as to justify the electors in strengthening its ranks
at the forthcoming elections. Premier Deakin’s
party is a very uncertain quantity indeed ; Geouge
Reid’s party is a certainly bad quantity ; the best
hope for Australia is in the strengthening of the
Labor party and of other radical sections so as to
make a Kingston Administration possible
♦
The Sydney Attitude of Squeal.
The Sydney morning paper attitude in Australian
politics suggests the wearisome wail of the “girl
who’s been betrayed ” of cheap melodrama.
It’s a mixture of petty childishness, female
hysteria, and plain, unadulterated hog. What
real grievance these newspapers have against the
Federation amounts simply to this : that under
the Federal regime they have been deprived of the
unjust subsidies and the unwarrantably high Pro-
tection which they enjoyed under State Govern-
ment. Galled by this, they misrepresent the
N.S.W. feeling towards the Federation as one of
greedy squealing for unearned concessions, and
querulous weeping because of unrecognisable
wrongs. N.S.W. —if provincial accounts are'to be
cast up, and a small, jealous State-suspheions
ledger kept—has not done at all badly
in the Federation. It provided the first
Premier and three of the first Ministers.
The Government whip, the Opposition leader,
the leader of the Labor party, the chairman of
committees, and the Opposition whip were
appointed from among its members. All the big
plums of the Federal civil service dropped in the
way of N.S.W. When the High Court came to
be appointed all three members were from Sydney
University, and two were Sydney citizens. And
so on through the list. Such calculations are
nauseating. They suggest —which is a lying
suggestion—that in Federated Australia the
small, old-woman provincial squabbles ought to
be kept alive. But if they are. made, they are all
in favor of N.S.W. Still the Sydney papers
squeal and suggest “secession,” as much as they
dare, and foment a purely provincial, as against a
national, feeling. So far, their efforts have
not done any special harm in fanning
the flames of jealousy in the other States.
Barring a few equally small - minded and
miserable Mrs. Gummidges mooning about
Melbourne newspaper offices, Australia has taken
no notice. Sydney, through its newspapers, has
boo-hooed “I won’t play in your back-yard” to
the other States, and has always been invited,
nevertheless, to come in and have cake and
lemonade in the best parlor. But that tolerance
can’t last for ever. The Sydney sheets cry
“wolf” now when there is no wolf, but their
mean and miserable whines may any day bring
that wolf into actual being, and then N.S.W. will
be treated as the discontented and petulant child
of. the Federal nursery. Such a development
would be deplorable, but it would not be
unnatural. The Sydney cry is to go on a lone
hand in all things, to have the tariff framed to
suit Sydney and Sydney alone, to have the capital
located where it will best serve Sydney’s inter-
ests, to run the Federation as if it were a mere
appanage to an area of 20 square miles
around Wynyard Square. So far this cry
has evoked no general response from the other
States, or from that part of N.S.W. which has
ideas outside of the wholesale drapers’ area of the
metropolis. But what if it succeeds in its avowed
object, and a sharp line is drawn with the Federa-
tion on one side and Sydney on the other ? It
would be a bad day for a city which, in spite of
its dominant clique of drapers, is the greatest of
the Commonwealth—a bad day, and with no great
aid to come from the young gentlemen of the
socks department and their employers—mostly
Messrs, something ending in -help, or -stein, or
-BERG.
4.
The Dying Effort of the 48 Rich
Landlords.
This being the last session in which the present
48 Rich Landlords will disgrace themselves in Vic.
Upper House (they will be replaced under the
Reform Act by a smaller House of Moderately-
Bloated Landowners), they decided to let them-
selves loose, and indulged in an act of mad folly
which will rouse many of their constituents
against them—even the worst kind of their con-
stituents. The occasion arose over the Factories
Bill, extending and making permanent the pre-
sent Act which expires with this month. Said
Bill was a modification of the old Act, in that it
made no reference to shops, put no special re-
striction on Chinese, and established a Court of.
Appeal for aggrieved employers and employees.
The 48 Landlords agreed to the second reading-
without any objections beyond the customary
irrelevant remarks of legislators with an impedi-
ment in their intellects; then they went into com-
mittee. When they emerged from that in-
terval of riotous enjoyment they had wrecked,
the unfortunate measure, and leaped on,
Irvine and his Government with both feet..
First, they restricted the duration of the Bill
to December, ’O6, and, being then warmed
to their work, cordially supported Embling— of
the ponderous jowl—when he proposed to make:
the minimum-wage clause apply to women andi
children only. When one of the Incapables told
a quaint, but idiotically false tale of a “clever
young mechanic whose former wage of £2a week
was reduced by the Act to 155.” (an Act which
they knew stipulated a minimum but no maximum
wage), they laughed ; when another expressed his
certainty that the workers (always the poor
workers) would be improved if freed from these
exasperating Labor conditions, they chuckled ;
and when E.UBLiNG finally told them his amend-
ment had been prepared by the Employers Fede-
ration, they howled down all protests, and passed
the amendment by 18 votes to 10. Next morning,
even the Tory Argus referred to their action as
“ drastic, impulsive, and not at all prudent.”
Meeting again next night they abolished all
restriction of apprentices, threw alb laundries
white and yellow—outside the Act, and decided
that Wages Boards (the few “female” Boards
that remained) should only be appointed by con-
sent of both Houses, which, as the Council doesn’t
intend to consent, practically abolished the
measure. That’s the position at present. Mean-
while the “cool, calm lawyer” is assuring every
bpdy that he feels certain the Incapables will
reverse the vote on consideration, and Peacock is
strenuously desiring the workers to “remain
calm for a few to give the Council time to
reconsider the position.” This paper opines there
is too much calmness altogether about the matter,
and that a little vigorous action such as an enraged
Kingston might take would improve the situa-
tion. The action of the Landlords is an
exhibition of inSane folly, an ebullition of blind
rage and coarse malice against men who have
no quarrel with them personally and against
a Government which, because it hadn’t the pluck
to do otherwise, has ever treated them with con-
siderate kindness mixed with persuasive tender-
ness. Their action, from the point of view of
those with whom they are supposed to have most


sympathy—the factory owners and bosses —is
utterly inexplicable. On the evidence those
employers gave before the Factories Com-
mission, that body (and it included some
of those very Landlords) unanimously de-
cided that a “ return to the old sweating
conditions was impossible,” and recommended
Arbitration Courts in preference to Wages
Boards, yet the House of Landlords will have
none of either. By abolishing the Wages Boards
for adult males, under which Boards the factories
of Victoria have increased and extended as they
never did before, the blundering Landlords not
only expose the honest employer to the unrestricted
competition of the merciless sweater, but force
both back to the old, hideous era of strike and
strife, stoppage of trade, loss of business, loss
of revenue to the State and partial ruin.
There is only one good feature in the case. The
Australian Parliament has power to start a
crusade, by means of a Federal graduated land-
tax and drastic Federal Arbitration laws, which
will crush to the dust the sweating party that the
Victorian House of Landlords represents, and
the coarse, ignorant malice of that body is prepar-
ing the way for some such crusade. The Aus-
tralian Parliament, it is true, has only power to
act when labor disputes spread to more than one
State, but any labor dispute can be spread to
more than one State—and then the Federal Court
can take Embling by the feet and knock his head
against the wall.
The Cowardice of South Australia.
Ip Jenkins Iscariot had an ordinary amount of
self-respect he would have resigned the South
Australian Premiership the other day. His
Treasurer brought down Estimates which showed
a small nominal surplus. It was purely nominal
because South Australia habitually fakes its
accounts by excluding Northern Territory figures
from the reckoning, and because, like the other
States, it charges a large amount of its ordinary
expenditure to loans. Last year, partly by col-
lecting an extra farthing land tax and by reducing
the income-tax exemption to £135, and partly by
waiting on the doorstep of the trustees of a dead
man’s estate on the last day of the financial year,
a nominal surplus was realised —nominal for the
reasons before mentioned. Actually the deficit
was a very large one; the Northern Territory
shortage alone is about £lOO,OOO a year. Even
excluding this, however, the Treasurer left no
margin to speak of in his Estimates for this year,
and certainly not enough to permit of any mon-
keying with the taxation. Yet the Assembly
deliberately, by 11 votes to 18, struck off the extra
farthing land tax, thereby reducing the Treasurer’s
expectations by £30,000 ; and it followed this up
by raising the income-tax exemption from £135 to
£l5O, thus further reducing the estimated revenue
by £7OOO. In their place the House neither pro-
posed nor suggested anything. It knew that even
in a phenomenally prosperous year, and disregar-
ding the Northern Territory deficit altogether,
and saying nothing about the charging of ordinary
expenditure to loans, the higher taxes only just
brought the accounts square; and it knew perfectly
well that, if the Treasurer had not had a windfall
in probate duties in the last few hours of last year,
the accounts for South Australia proper, would
■have shown over £lO,OOO of a deficit. It knew
also that, even such a surplus as there was, and
obtained as it was, was only possible by starving
railway repairs. It knew, further, that so far this
year the returns have been unsatisfactory. And
yet, in the teeth of all this, it reduced the taxa-
tion, and, so far as it was concerned, deliberately
decided that it would rather have a deficit
than pay a farthing land-tax. Practically the
whole body of country members voted for this
unpatriotic policy of dishonesty, cowardice, and
selfishness; they pleaded for the “ poor farmer,”
notwithstanding that the poor farmer of South
Australia is in a better position to pay a farthing
land-tax now than ever before. A self-respecting
Government which was instructed to drop the
taxation upon which it relied to keep the accounts
-square would have thrown the dirty job of running
a State on such terms into the face of the Parlia-
ment that dictated them; bub evidently the
Jenkins Iscariot Ministry’s hunger for office is
keener than its self-respect; so it continues in the
job, and lias some faint hopes of making up the
shortage by charging higher railway rates. If
it does that, the only small consolation will
be that the country members who voted
to reduce the land-tax will fall in badly ; for the
land-tax would have been collected from the
resident owners of city and suburban lands, and
from the South Australian Company and other
absentee owners of country lands, as well as from
the “poor farmers” who work their own land;
while the higher railway freights will have to be
paid exclusively, or nearly so, by the poor farmer
himself, even though he be only a tenant. The
Bulletin doesn’t often want the poor farmer, and
especially the tenant farmer, pinched ; but it
wants to see him pinched now —pinched so hard
that he will kick the political crowd that would
rather have a deficit than ask the landlord for a
farthing tax.
The Victorian Ploughman and Other
Matters.
A notable extract from Victorian Hansard —
that magnificent Tory, Frank Madden, is speak-
ing :
The most difficult man to get in the bush at present is
a good ploughman, and, if you do get him, you will have
to pay him at least £1 per week, and to keep him.
Mr. Ramsay : That is terrible !
Mr. Madden : lb is not terrible, but it is a fair wage,
and will enable a thrifty man to save money.
It will enable a thrifty single man to save money,
no doubt—a desperately thrifty single man. But
he lias got to remain single to do it. There is no
show for marriage on that wage, and no chance to
legitimately give the birth-rate a shove up, and
to help to increase the great and noble Anglo-
Saxon race, so that it may hold its own upon the
earth. Of course, the tenant-farmer, in many
cases, can’t give more wages. After he has paid
the stupendous rack-rents which the Madden
olass demands, he can’t pay much. So, starting
with the first cause, and getting on to the effects,
and the effects of these effects, the order of things
is about as follows :
The grasping Tory landlord class (Clarkes, Manifolds,
Austins, Ohirnsides, etc.), admired by Frank Madden,
and sole owners of the Upper House which dictates the
policy of the State.
Enormous Rents.
Struggling Tenants.
Poor Wages.
Unmarried Laborers.
Decline of the Birth-rate.
Decay of the Anglo-Saxon Race.
Illegitimacy.
Baby-farming.
Dead Infant in Paddock.
That is one series of results all springing from the
rich landlord; but there is another. The rich
landlord’s domination also leads to there being
hardly any land-tax, wherefore come insufficient
revenue, deficits, destruction of the public
credit, cutting down of old age pensions and
votes for hospitals and lunatic asylums, and
the spectacle of decent old men and women
dying of starvation or being put in gaol for
lack of any other shelter, and the gruesome
story of neglected lunatics sleeping two or three
in a bed, and other horrors. All these horrors
start from the existence of well-meaning people
like the Clarkes and Ohirnsides and so on,
who are charitable because they give back to the
poor a fraction of the great national land-steal,
and who are hospitable out of the great national
land-steal, and patronise art a little out of the
great national land-steal, and whose general
picturesqueness in a squirearchal sort of way
all arises out of the same old curse. No country
can support a fine, rich, picturesque, charitable,
artistic, well-educated, benevolent, well-meaning,
landed aristocracy without being damned. It
takes a lot of land and a lot of money to
support all those good qualities on the part of
the squirearchy, and it is an immutable law that
when one small class has so much money there is
mighty little left for other classes. In the natural
order of things it can’t be otherwise. No country
has yet managed to accumulate wealth to the ex-
tent of much over £3OO per inhabitant —thelnsane
calculations made about the wealth of Australiain
the boom time may be left out of the calculation.
And if one class averages £lOO,OOO per head all
the good qualities of that class-all its culture,
benevolence, picturesqueness and so on—can’t
alter the fact that, at the other end of the scale,
women and children are dying of want because of
its existence, for there isn’t enough wealth to go
round.

Victoria’s Approaching’ Railway Block.
Victoria, as is usual at this season of the year,
stands on the edge of a great calamity, only this
time it promises to be a record calamity. The
annual railway breakdown is at hand. So far
there is an entire lack of any adequate preparation
on the part of the authorities to cope with the
immense harvest, which threatens to exceed any-
thing yet heard of in Victoria. That the usual
block in the grain traffic would cause annoyance is
a small consideration ; it is the monetary side of
the question that is important. In the northern
parts of the State the farmers are just emerging
from the cycle of drought and privation. They
are still loaded with mortgages to storekeepers’and
others, and the storekeepers are mortgaged to- the
banks. Early realisation on the produce is an abso-
lute necessity, and the annual breakdown will get
in the way, as usual. Even last year, when the
grain harvest throughout the greater portion of
Victoria was a total failure, and the Railway
Department had only 2,600,000 bushels of wheat
to shift, as compared with a probable 20,000,000
bushels this year, it was unable to cope with the
demand for transport. Grain was banked up all
along the lines, and fanners awaited anxiously the
trucks that never came. The traffic authorities
knew that there were trucks, but just where they
were at that psychological moment nobody could
tell. Whole trains had mysteriously disappeared.
When they did put in an appearance it was too
late ; the consignees had* grown tired of waiting,
and their produce had gone by road. That was
in a year when the total wheat supply was one-
eighth of what it is likely to he this,year. And
with this tremendous problem ahead, railway pre-
parations are practically at a standstill. True,
the new Commissioner has promised-tthat 600
more trucks will be available this than last
year. But if the Railway Department was
unable to cope with a mere pretence of a harvest
on that occasion, 600 trucks will make little
difference in a record year. It is not in the
number of conveyances, however, but in the
handling of them that the secret of the situation
lies. Then, as to haulage power, it has been
officially stated that 40 more engines will be put
into commission. These, however, are of the
decrepit description that will rather impede than
expedite operations, and when it is remembered
that search parties have every day to go out
looking for a missing train which has broken down
somewhere in the backblocks because the good
engine has collapsed, no one has much confidence
in the patched-up scrap-heap, honored by the
title “locomotive,” which has been on pension at
Newport for an extended period and is now to be
resurrected. Then, again, where are the men to
be found to run the puffing cripples? Since
last year Victoria has lost through a short-sighted
policy of brutal tyranny the best of its engine-
men, the majority of whom have left the State.
The running service is seriously undermanned at
present, and ex-striker and blackleg alike are
worked inordinately long hours. Stations through-
out the country are all being managed with greatly
reduced staffs, and one man is doing the work
that four previously performed. Instances are
daily recorded in which stationmasters have
worked continuously for 16 and 20 hours. What
the conditions will be when the harvest sets in it i 3
hard to imagine. It is only when 100,000 bushels
of grain are blocked at the Goulburn Valley rail-
way stations that the advantages of Bent manage-
ment will be fully appreciated.
The Misery of being Represented by
Wilks and Cook.
Three or four N.S.W. politicians, State and
Federal, made a pitiable display of themselves
and did their best to drag the honor of their State
in the gutter in the last days of the shindy over
the selection of the Australian capital. Here
are some samples:—
Mr. Wilks : The whole idea of having the capital in
New South Wales was that New South Wales should gain
by it.
Mr. Thomson treated as absurd the arguments for direct
access from another State. It negatived the very idea
for which Federation was established. He did not see
why a Victorian railway should he built into New South
Wales territory, but he was favorable to have a connec-
tion made by rail with the Victorian system.
Mr. Oook : The concession of the capital was to be a
substantial concession. It was not a sentimental conces-
sion. Direct access from and thereat were conditions
that ought to be considered, but it had no right to be
made a condition. That was a matter which should have
been dealt with before the Oonstitution adopted its ex-
pressed arrangement.
Speaking at the railway employees’ picnic at
Lithgow, Mr. W. Young, M.L.A., said, in regard
to the action of the Federal Parliament concerning
the capital site, the fact that one House selected
Tumut and the other Bombala was calculated to delay
the establishment of the capital for years to come. It
was contrary to the intention of the framers of
the Oonstitution, if not a direct violation. It was
lor this State to assert its rights, and lay down the
situation for the .Federal capital, and tell the Federal
Parliament that they insisted on them taking the one
chosen. If the Federal Parliament did not comply with
the proposal and accept the site laid down he would have
no hesitation in declaring that this State should burst up
the union at the first opportunity. The proposal he
made was that they should offer the Federal Parliament
the Lyndhurst site—the only site in the State carrying
with it commercial and social benefits.
It is surely more than time for N.S.W. to protest
against the dirty slanders of its small Cooks and
petty Thomsons and obscure Wilkses and it 3
insignificant Youngs. Even if the whole idea of
haying the capital in N.S.W. was that N.S.W.
should make a profit at the expense of Australia,
in general, it must be remembered that N.S.W.
gave a majority for the acceptance of the Consti-
tution before the stipulation about the capital
being in that State was inserted, so Wilks and
Cook have no right to talk as if that sordid and
foolish job was the work of the people of N.S.W.
When the awful Thomson and the still more-
awful Cook lay it down that the other States of
Australia have no right to railway communication,
with their own capital, they may speak for them-
selves, but they also have no right to assume that
their State is equally degraded. As for the obscure
Young, with his further theory that the other
States should have no voice in the selection of
their own capital, he, and people like him, are
doing their level best to arouse a feeling in the-
other States that N.S.W. is the common enemy
and must be combined against in the common
interest. Young and liis kind are gratuitous'
mischief-makers. All their petty gabble about
the “intentions of the framers of the Constitu-
tion” to have the Federal capital as near as
possible to the lOfomiles limit from Sydney, and to
restrict the area of the Federal territory as closely
as possible to the 100 square miles minimum, is the
silliest kind of beer-froth. Out of the 50 framers
of the Constitution 45 weren’t even consulted on.
either of these matters, so they could have n»
intentions at all. Five of the Constitution
builders (the leader of the Convention not being
among them), and one new man who was never in.
the Convention, inserted the clause dealing with
the Federal capital, after the Convention was over'
and after the Bill, without any such proviso, had
been accepted by a majority in every State-
where it was put to a popular vote. There-
fore the framers of the Constitution are
bound only by the letter of the Constitution-,
in this matter, and to plead that they had hidden,
or unexpressed intentions in a matter about which
they were never consulted is sheer childishness.
If N.S.W. is to get a fair deal over the Federal,
capital matter, or any other matter, it badly
wants to get rid of a few of the Cook, Thomson,
and Wilks clan, whose efforts to make their State
the best-hated place in Australia may succeed,
despite their political insignificance and worth-
lessness.

Turner’s Lost Opportunity.
A great wilderness of disappointing corres-
pondence has been published in the matter of the
£5,000,000 loan which Victoria renewed the other
day on such disastrous terms. From these docu-
ments it appears that the Victorian Treasurer, as
far back as last March, urged the Australian.
Government to take over the debt as the first
beginning of a process of federalising the State
liabilities, and the negotiation fell through for
quite insufficient reasons. Probably Treasurer
Turner wasn’t wholly responsible for the failure,
but most certainly somebody was shockingly
cautious and deficient in enterprise. The reasons
given why the Victorian .£5,000,000 loan was not-
taken over were:
That the Australian Government couldn’t federalise a
part of the debt of one State without doing the same to
all others.
That the loan market being in a shockingly bad con-
dition the first Federal loan would have to go off at a low
price, which would set up a bad precedent as regards-
future loans.
That it wasn’t good enough for the Australian Govern-
ment to begin taking over State loans until the States*
made some arrangement to limit future boriowings.
These propositions all have a certain plausibility,
yet as a matter of fact they are all sophistry,,
bunkutn, and empty wind. This is what a more-
enterprising and intelligent Government would,
have done in the matter :
It would have passed a Banking law on the lines of the
Act which has proved so successful in Canada, requiring
all banks doing business in the Commonwealth to hold at
least 40 per cent, of their cash reserves in Government
notes. This would have given it the use, as a perpetual
loan, without interest, of from £8,000,000 to £10,000,000.
It would have taken up the Victorian renewal loan
itself at 3.) per cent. Then Victoria would have paid.
£175,000 a year interest to the Australian Government
instead of to the English creditor. This money could
have been put aside as a fund towards the construction of'
a Federal capital, or invested in the further re-purchase
of State securities. 1
This process would have saved Vic toria a lob of
money. It would have reduced the tribute Aus-
tralia has to pay to England by about £200,000 a
year. It would have given our blessed credit a
huge lift, for the Cohen in London would nave
been staggered by the spectacle of this countiy
actually repaying a loan. It would have made
our securities go up in London, and many a baiiK
which holds £lOO,OOO worth of Government bonds
would have made £5OOO profit by the rise. 1
would have given the Australian Government a
new income of £175,000 a year —without any corres-
ponding outlay-£175,000 a year clear profit. And
the difficult question of federalising the State debts
wouldn’t have arisen at all. There was no need to
wait for that. The Victorian £5,000,000 loan
wouldn’t have been taken over by the Australian
Government as an Australian responsibility ,
Victoria would still owe the money, & n .d
Australia would receive the interest, which is
quite a different thing from Australia taking over
tne debt and paying the interest. The chance
was lost —fooled away through over-caution. But
that is no reason why the next chance should be
lost in a similar luckless fashion. There are
£3,000,000 of N.S.W. loans falling due in 1905,
and other large amounts in 1906, and the Common-
wealth should buy them up bodily, as a profitable
cash investment made on behalf of Australia in
general. It could do a lot in this way, and still
have enough money—provided it adopted the
Canadian banking system as suggested to start
its Federal capital. Or the Australian Govern-
ment could raise £8,000,000 or £10,000,000 in the
way suggested, and spend it now in buying up the
cheapest and most depreciated of the State
securities in the open market, and accumulate the
interest as a Federal capital fund. Ihe oppor-
tunity is one that an enterprising Government
with some bright and progressive financial ideas
would snatch at with both hands.
+
What is Needed from Premier Deakin.
It is necessary for Mr. Deakin, as Federal
Premier, to now explain himself. He took office
in a moribund Parliament from the hands of a
Premier who was under sentence of political dis-
missal because he had fallen away from grace in the
matter of the Arbitration Bill. He was allowed
to hold office because there were various routine
obstacles in the way of a change, and because the
general elections were so near that it didn t
matter much who was Premier for the while. No
particular policy was to be expected from Mr.
Deakin under those circumstances. He simply
had to drift on to a dissolution, and he drifted in
a lady-like and amiable manner. Now, however,
that he comes before the electors with a demand
for their confidence as leader of the next Australian
Parliament, something definite is called for in the
way of a policy. It will probably be a great
hardship to Mr. Deakin to be definite. He
prefers to say something pretty about a glorious
ideal, and a vague, undefinable longing, and a
high national destiny, and the aspiration of the
human race towards the Fourth Dimension, and
so on. But Mr. Deakin cannot hope to come
back to office on the Fourth Dimension and the
Esoteric Kowfoozlemum; indeed, the less elo-
quenoe he carries in his handbag when he goes
electioneering the better. What the country •
wants is a plain statement of his views on the
various questions which face the Federation, of
which the following are the chief: —
The Australian Parliament has so far not borrowed any
money tor public works. Does Mr. Deakin intend to
continue that eminently wise and sane non-borrowing
policy, and at the same time to keep the public works
which are in charge o,fthe Federation in good order and
build necessary new -works ? |lf fie means to be an honest,
non-borrowing Premier does he propose to start a public
works tend -supplied out ot revenue, or what?
The progress of the Commonwealth is being throttled
by a rich landlord class .monopolising the best agricul-
tural lands, and a rich absentee class drawing tribute
jfrom our workers to be spent abroad. Does Mr. Deakin
propose-a Federal land-tax, graduated so as to break
down big land monopolies, and a Federal absentee-tax ?
What are Mr. Deakin’s views as to improving the
present compromise tariff and striving to make it really
Protectionist?
The interests of Australia are obviously bound up with
the progress of the Federal Government and the dimi-
nution of the power .of the absurd little wrangling,
mostly dishonest and incapable State Governments.
What does Mr. Deakin .propose for the progress of the
Federal idea? Will he push .forward the Federalisation
of the railways, and the debts., .and of old age pensions
and industrial legislation?
The Ministry of which Mr. was a member,
and the Rump of which he now .leads, deliberately
strangled the Federal Industrial Arbitration Bill at the
behest of Mr. Irvine. Does Mr. Deakin ..propose to be
Mr. Irvine’s creature, too, in that matter, <F will he
bring down to next Parliament an adequate Arbitration
Bill, extending to State employees and seamep ?
There is a strong provincial movement to make ,tfijs
Federal capital question an issue of inter-State jealousy.
Will Mr. Deakin declare definitely for a national choice
of locality and a national area—not less than 1000 square
miles, and 5000 square miles if possible ?
There are other questions on which a definite
word from Mr. Deakin would be welcome. But
these are the chief matters about which he is
called upon to be explicit. If, as there is some
reason to expect, Mr. Deakin hopes to hold office
on a large, beautiful, vague platform—something
•of the rainbow order, pretty to look at, but leading
:nowhere, and too beautifully .curved to afford
much foothold —he will not give an answer to
these questions. But if he really aspires to be a
national statesman, with serious ideals and .true
principles, he will declare himself on all of it.he.pi
decisively and fully. Australia has a full hand ,qf
State Governments, whose finance system, up to
this, has been mainly pawn and purloin. It wants
a central Government which will be strictly honest
and non-borrowing, never to be found sneaking to
•Cohen with an asset under its coat. But it is
quite plain that the Australian Government cannot
long continue to be that sort of a self-respecting,
■self-supporting institution unless it has ampler
financial resources than at present. If, as a
'consequence of not borrowing, the post office
iis allowed to fall to ruin, as an alterna-
tive to being pledged, the cure is worse than
the disease. Side by side with the need to
’raise adequate funds for an honest and pro-
gressive public works policy and for the federalisa-
tion of old age pensions, there exists an urgent
meed for the taxation of huge land monopolies and
’absentees, so that the , drain on the piosperity of
the continent which they represent shall be
stopped. A Federal land-tax is wanted not only
for the revenue which it will bring in, but for the
’monopolies (such as those of the V.D.L. co. in
'Tasmania, the Peel River and A. A. co’s in N.S.W.,
■or the Western district squires in Victoria) which
It will banish. No hope exists for an effective
’grappling with these monopolies by the State
Governments ; in any case, the Federation is the
■only power which can deal with the evil
as it affects the whole Commonwealth. Further,
with the tariff situation as it is no sincere Protec-
. tionist can profess to be satisfied. The conipro-
■ raise tariff still leaves a,-, vast body of workers
■exposed to cheap-labor competition from abroad.
, Australia needs a range of duties at least as high
as those now ruling in Canada (and even those the
a Canadians regard as a compromise with Freetrade).
4 Australia will await Mr. Dkakin’s pronounce-
lloment on the matters here set forth with interest.
A Song of Empire.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
How sweetly they cotton together—John Bull
and Ram Dass and Ah Cow—
The white and the brown and the yellow are
brethren in verity now ;
They sit at the table of Nations—a quaint indi-
visible One—
But John has the vote in his pocket, and John
is the man with the gun.
And journals, in column on column, dilate on the
brotherhood grand,
And banquetting cockneys in dozens responsive
rise up to expand,
And Bull in liis plenitude bellows —“Each
heathen I hail as a son !”
But lest they lose sight of the duties of sonship he
sticks to the gun.
His Empire is built on the Bible—most precious
of things in his pack,
And the sun never sets on the nations who sleep
in the line of his track ;
His mission’s to whitewash the Vandal and put a
clean shirt on the Hun,
And to drive home the lessons of healing he
hangeth on tight to the gun.
For powder—black powder—is mighty to blast
and to bless and to damn ;
It speaks with a pleading so potent to Runjeet
and ebony Ham ;
And Bull —he believeth in powder (but Runjeet
and Ham shall have none),
But he giveth them counsel and blessing, and bids
them —Beware of the Gun !
For precept is one thing, but practice comes first
in the codex of Bull,
And practice without any profit he holds it but
rightly as null;
He minds not the cause of the battle — he counts
what his hirelings have won,
And times the sweet hymn of Thanksgiving by
belting the floor with his gun.
And Runjeet, the cautious and cunning, he
stoopeth him low with Ah Cow,
And weeps that his kinsmen are heathen who
bend to the idol and bow;
“0, Mighty,” he cries, “is the Briton, but the
greatest of deeds he hath done
Is the feat where he hugs us as brothers —yet keeps a
good grip on his Gun! ”

It rests entirely -with our settlers whether it shall cost them and the State a large amount

And we pray that Mr. Deakin will be of all things

The Commonwealth has at least the right to know
from the man who claims to be its Premier what
his ideas are. The call is for straight talk as to
principles, n6t glowing adjectives, and hyperbole
and apostrophe and such like ornaments.

The mystery of what is in the incriminating
document that is going to burst up the peace of
Europe has not been cleared up since “The
French Spy” last escaped from Russia in a 34-
knot British torpedo boat. In consequence of
the long silence of the Spy, The Bulletin had, as
a matter of fact, begun to hope that British
ambassadors had got out of the bad habit of
leaving papers that would precipitate war lying
about, it having been proved that Britain isn’t
always in a fit state to be thus precipitated;
but the Spy breaks out again, this time at Sydney
Palace, and thus another hope is blasted. The
yolk of the story is that the Spy, having stolen
the paper, falls in love with the captain in
Whose charge it is, and then, having sworn to
point out the captain when she sees him, in order
that his enemy may wipe him off the face of
Russia, she blinds herself so that she may not see
him. So she keeps her oath and also her boy,
and gets a call in front of the curtain into the
bargain. In the development of this plot the
stage is turned into something like an inter-
national exhibition. There’s a Russian Chief of
Police who grunts (only the man who now has the
job doesn’t grunt as much as Charles Holloway
used.to), and a German frontier guard who spend's
his time insulting the Russian guard on the other
side of a wicket gate, and several British officers
who are, of course, heroes to a man and the
best-looking fellows in the show, and an
Irishman, and the French spy before-mentioned.
Happily the only one who doesn’t talk good Eng-
lish is the gentleman from Tipperary ; he, being
the chief comedian, isn’t allowed to talk English—
the chief comedian in melodrama rarely is. Miss
Fitzmaurice Gill’s Spy is a rather uneven per-
formance ; very good indeed in spots, but weak in
the first act. Charles Blake is a pleasant-voiced,
manly attache, who gets most of the rest of the
limelight; Gus Neville has Holloway’s old Chief
of Police part, and though the dramatic scenes
in which he figures most largely are marred
by want of stage room, he handles the character
well; and L. D. Chateau is a reasonably natural
Irishman. The others—especially the shallow
Russian adventuress and a little lady who, for
some unknown reason, is given a male part—might
be a good deal better without calling for anything
conspicuous in the way of praise.
** * *
The “Toreador” still pursues its fierce
but invisible bull at Her Majesty’s (Sydney) but
its last nights are announced, and the “Country
Girl” will blush and smile her way on to the
vaoated stage. “ Toreador ” has proved a
magnetic draw ; full houses were the rule through-
out the season and on Friday night last, which
was not the end of any special day, there was a
record audience. The Sydney publio plainly
craves for musical comedy—even if it is a rather
poor kind of musical comedy.
** * *
Two good old favorites came back to Sydney
Criterion on Saturday—“ The Shaughraun ” and
Charles Holloway—and it was hard to say which
of them had the warmer welcome on opening
night. Holloway, of course, is Father Dolan
Sligo’s guide, philosopher, and friend, and he
gives a fine, artistic representation of a fine
artistic character. If it is not absolutely the best
thing done in melodrama this season, it is so close
to it that the difference doesn’t matter. J P
O’Neill is the other sort of Hibernian, Conn the
Shaughraun himself. O’Neill is an artesian well
of brogue ; if you want to stop the flow you have
to put in a plug, and even then there is generally
a tremulous gurgle which isn’t always pleasant
But here O’Neill is free,- the plug is out; and
he probably feels more comfortable than in almost
any other of the 5361 or so parts he has played
and overplayed. But, if O’Neill is an artesian
well of brogue, most of the others are dry dams
In the first act, on first night, they pumped hard ’
after that, they gave it up, and talked Australian’
and the change was for the better. Cass gives
over villainy for the occasion, and does unusually
well as Robert Folliott; Hodson looks the
squireen, and that is the best that can be said •
and the others don’t call for either honey or a
brick. The mounting is effective; so is the dirge
at Conn s wake ; and altogether, but especially for
the sake of Holloway’s Father Dolan, “The
Shaughraun ” is hereby recommended. The
public needs occasionally to be reminded that
melodrama doesn’t necessarily consist of a stolen
will, six assorted murders, one bottle of vitriol
one Face at the Window, one Tooth in the Coal-
Scuttle, one pie-stall, and a bad woman who says
that she is what you men have made her.
** * *
Judging by the big audiences, and the
eager interest those audiences take in the progress
of the play, Her Second Time on Earth ”at
Sydney Lyceum is due for a long stay. The
Anderson melodrama has the advantage of
leaving nothing at all to the imagination. No
(t problem ” vexes the playgoer at this house.
Did he fall or was he pushed ? ” may be in
doubt, but only for a second or two; the villain-
m? SS P ronl to explain that he was pushed and
that she “ purrushed ” him. There is no room to
mistake villain or villainness; their every entry
is heralded by the tremulous squeaking of
muted fiddles, crying out like timid mice in
night. Their plans and motives are made equally
plain with longj monologue explanations; so the
gallery 13 never m danger of wasting a hiss on an
unworthy object, and can always sort out for the
benefit of its girl the good and bad lots of the
piece: and that gives the gallery a pleasing sense
knowledge and education. Melodrama of the
very highly-colored variety appeals to a big class
in Sydney, and manager Anderson throws the
oolor on with a bucket.
The latest news from Sydney Tivoli is
that a large and influential deputation from
Freetrade League has waited upon
Madame Marzella, and asked that she should
allow any performing parrots that she hasn’t any
other use for to be nominated for the forthcoming
elections. Madame explained that they weren’t
Australian parrots, and didn’t know anything of
politics. She was informed that they weren’t
expected to—all that was necessary was that they
should be able to repeat “ great natural resources”
and “ free and enlightened people.” She is now
thinking it over. Meantime, the wonderful birds
are nightly performing tricks which seem to
suggest that their talents will be wasted if they
are transferred to the other place of enter-
tainment. In addition to Marzella’s birds, the
reigning attractions are Miss Fuller and Hallen’s
bright “sketch” and Ernest Fitts’ songs. Business
is as good as ever, which is to say that it is just
about as good as the size of the theatre will allow
it to be.
** * *
Melbourne Town Hall was packed on
Saturday night (Oct. 24), when the Philharmonic
revived “Elijah.” Ada Crossley, of course, was
prime factor in the success of the concert, though
the fact remains that, star or no star, oratorio can
always command “on its own” substantial sup-
port, drawn from that section of the community
which bridles complacently at the mention of the
Nonconformist Conscience, but describes as blas-
E heinous any reference to the wire-pullers of
little Bethel. Moreover, “Elijah,” more drama-
tic and varied than most kindred works, and, as
such, popular even outside the clique which
patronises oratorio on principle, has the knack of
drawing a full house—when prices are normal.
To Ada, not “Elijah,” goes the credit of attract-
ing bumper support at double rates.
* * * *
In oratorio, Miss Crossley’s beautiful,
though not phenomenal, voice told better in the
nobly pathetic airs, written by Mendelssohn for
the contralto “angel,” than in dramatic passages
or lines of declamatory force. Work of the latter
kind seemed tiring to the singer’s voice, and by
the time the eagerly expected and exquisitely
sung “ O Best in the Lord ! ” was reached, there
was a palpable tendency to hoarseness. The gem
of the contralto’s admirable performance was,
maybe, the plaintive reproach, instilled into the
line “ Though they are by Him redeemed,”
occurring in “ Woe unto them.” The contralto’s
concerted work should be taken as a model by
every part-singer fortunate enough to hear it.
Too artistic to mar the balance of voices by yield-
ing to the power of her own rich tones, the vocalist-
in-ehief modulated her voice, in trios and quar-
tettes, to suit the sopranos, till the general effect
was like birds trilling their lays in a cathe-
dral, awash with organ melody. The Crossley
voice has not the tireless freshness of Melba’s;
the breathing methods, too, are more apparent.
Turning to contraltos, Patey was gifted with notes
of more organlike richness, but as an interpreter
of song sentiment and a soulful artist, the Gipps-
land girl ranks pretty near perfection. Peterkin,
as Elijah, impressed hearers as a prophet who
realised the importance of taking good care of his
middle-aged, though well-preserved, voice. Gregor
Wood and the soprano-in-chief seemed outclassed.
Soprano number two (BebaKangan), the possessor
of a fresh, young voice and face to match, looked
a suitable exponent of the part of the Hebrew lad
who had to report on weather-appearances to
Babbi Elijah. The Philharmonic choir and
orchestra lived up to the importance of the occa-
sion, the singers pursuing less bawlful methods
than has sometimes been the case.
** * *
“ Monsieur Beaucaire,” afc Her Majesty’s
(Melbourne), will be withdrawn after “a few
more performances ” (which is an uncertain quan-
tity) to make way for “The Eternal City”;
therefore The Bulletin recommends its Mel-
bourne readers to read, mark, learn and digest the
advt. which bears upon this question.
** * #
“The World” is finishing a prosperous
fortnight at Melbourne Boyal, where “ The Great
Millionaire” falls due on Saturday. “The
Great Millionaire ’’ is Drury Lane melodrama up
to date, written by Cecil Baleigh, and conveyed
to Bland Holt with the best blessing and advice
of the far-off management.
** * m
At Melbourne Princess’s last Saturday, a
crowd of raw amateurs, professing to be persons
of “Society” rank (whatever “Society 5 * may
mean in this connection) gave a deplorable enter-
tainment in aid of local charities. One looks back
upon this display as a dream of horrors, relieved
by suggestions of humor from an imitative come-
dian (named J. Meagher, apparently) and some
clever dancing by two or three little girls, who
had been trained by Mrs. Green in the way
they should kick. But for that one somewhat
funny amateur mimic of funnier professional
comedians, and the competent juvenile per-
formers aforesaid, the whole show might be
written down as Wicked. It was a variety
show—a thing of preposterous shreds and
ridiculous patches, with J. J. Purves, K.C., in the
centre of the first part. Purves presided over the
most inane part that ever was, and in dull,
funereal tones he urged four burnt-cork failures
to let off wheezes. And the young ladies came
forward one by one, or two at a time, as though a
designing Rickards had hired them to demonstrate
their awful inferiority to the common, or “serio-
ehronic,” girls indigenous to the Opera House.
After the first part there were “turns”—“star
turns” —in one of which a society chorus girl dis-
tinguished herself by means of a goatlike gambol
on her trailing skirt. The skirt should have been
coquettishly lifted from the ground, but she per-
formed upon the tail-end of the garment, not know-
ing where it was, and the “ turn ” got six encores
on her aocount. Meanwhile the damsel who
chirped a ditty in the forefront of the proceedings
was taking all the credit for the encores to herself
instead of handing her bouquets to the heroine of
the unpremeditated skirt dance. The three hours
of vanity and vexation concluded with “A
Pantomime Rehearsal,” wherein the amateurs
proved incapable of satirising even themselves.
The original joke ceased to be a joke under their
treatment. Miss Elsie Abbott, in Nellie Stewart’s
part, was less unpardonable than the male section
of the horrible conspiracy, and Miss Daisy
Belmore (nowadays Mrs. Waxman) had a pro-
fessional deportment, anyhow. But Mrs. W.’s
comparative ability in this item didn’t excuse her
for singing the solo part in a previous coon scene.
The same programme was to be repeated two more
nights, unless the wrath of Heaven descended
upon the show in a solid form and put its light
out.
** * *
For Saturday next a return of Nellie
Stewart and Comedy is promised at the Prin-
cess’s. A while ago Melbourne feared it had lost
its Nellie for at least a year, and now it is glad to
hear she has consented to encore her last farewell
season. “Sweet Nell’’ is the opening item on
the programme of revivals. There are people
coming to town for the Cup who have never seen
“Sweet Nell,” ,and a lot more who will take an
early opportunity to see the brown king’s
“victim” once again. But a thoughtless world
never thinks of the promoted orange girl in the
play as a victim who endows almshouses with the
wages of Sin.
** * *
Mel. B. Spurr, a society entertainer who
is stated to. have held the floor for 700 nights at
the Egyptian Hall, London, will make his first
Australian appearance at the Athenaeum Hall
next Saturday (31st).. Herbert Flemming, lately
of S’Africa, whom this country knew for a bright
actor in days of yore, has brought Mel. B. Spurr
into our midst, and will present that stranger to
Melbourne notice. He might as well re-introduce
himself to notice at the same time.
** * #
The Power Bros., who put their heads
together whilst the underneath Power is uncom-
fortably situated on a tight wire, likewise Alberto,
the coin “ manipulator, ’ are now assisting juggler
Fields and other persons and things to make the
bill at .Rickards’. Some of the turns have arrived
at their last nights, but are likely to last over
Saturday.
** * *
Fitzgerald Bros.’ huge combined double-
extra Circus and Menagerie is making a favorable
impression in Melbourne as usual, or even more
so. The introductory- array of vociferous animals
is larger than it.was,and the elephant has grown
another three inches, and the circus presents a
very full assortment of features, familiar or other-
wise. The trapeze map who swings himself
blindly into space and catches on the other aerial
person is a popular novelty; also the lady who
sheds her looser garments on the slack wire seems
to supply a long-felt want. As for the horse por-
tion of the Fitzes’ entertainment, it appeals alike
to the fatted bookmaker and the shorn juggins,
but especially to the plump Hebrew. The gentle-
man with the successful nose loves the sight of a
well-disciplined gee-gee that goes lame or lies
down on word of command. As he spreads his
paunch in the front row of chairs he dreams golden
dreams of how he would suddenly “stiffen”
Emir, at ten strides from the winning-post, if he
only knew the way to do it.
** # *
Adelaide gave its rapt attention to Ada
Crossley for two eyenings and an afternoon,
during which it contrived to get about thirty
songs from her. Adelaide claims to have made
much more fuss of her in the old days than did
Sydney or Melbourne, and in the old days sym-
pathy and support were not a matter of course as
they are now. It also has a special interest in
Percy Grainger, and does not worry about his
hair being (comparatively) short, through never
having seen him when it was long. At the Royal,
farcical comedy has now set in, after an unpre-
cedented fortnight, in which the town was abso-
lutely theatreless. “ Are You a Mason ’’ is more
farce than comedy, but the struggles of the bad
old man, and the w.illing-to-be-bad son-in-law, and
the curiously uns.uspicions dowager, make up a
sufficiently uproarious mixture.
“ L. 8.” writes :
“Hamlet’s” remarks on Australian drama (“Poverty
Point,” l/10/’O3) remind me that, since my “Red Page”
note on the subject, I have gathered in a few more facts
on the subject, and that I must acknowledge that
“ Hamlet ” is right. If we had a local Shakspeare, he
wouldn’t get a chance at present as things are. I was
recently speaking to the representative of one of our big
managers, and he told me that he has read, within the
last year, at least ten local plays as well done as anything
produced in gngland. “Then,” I asked, “if they are
such good plays, why are they not produced?” and he
replied, “Good plays as they are, they are not likely to
be produced, for the simple reason that a manager is not
going to experiment himself when he can have his ex-
periments done for him in London, New York, and Paris.
Have you not noticed that every piece produced in Aus-
tralia is a ‘ suCcess ’? You,see, we are saved all the bother
of making experiments ourselves. And something more
than the trouble of experimenting is saved. A play often
comes out, not only with all the necessary scenery, cos-
tume9, and properties, but with the actors, many of
whom have already learnt and played their parts before
leaving for Australia. In a great many cases the
‘ printing,’ that is, the colored posters to advertise the
piece on hoardings and in shop windows, is sent out
with the piece. In fact, the whole theatrical entertain-
ment—the whole darned show—is sent out complete,
ready-made, like a bicycle or a piano.” It is obviously
impjssible for the local dramatist to contend against
these circumstances. It has suggested to me that we
want Protection for the local dramatist, and through the
customs-house. We want a stiff duty on everything
necessary for a theatrical entertainment, including the
MS. of the piece itself.

“ A. 5.,” from Vienna :
A warning to the young aspirant for artistic fame!
If you have a good voice and a fair billet, save the vocal
glory for your female friends, and hold fast to the office
stool. If you are a woman and have a man’s faith and
fortune at your feet, keep your songs and lullabies for his
friends and the baby. Those cables and pars in the press
give a picture which is, for the most part, all bunkum. A
colonial singer or instrumentalist makes an appearance—
say at St. James’s Hall—with a few sympathetic friends
as audience. If sufficiently advertised a line or two may
possibly appear in one of the dailies, but before a week
the event is lost in the ever-growing stream of fighters
for fame who madly swarm into “that great flood whose
ebb and flow at once is both deaf and loud.” A month
later we see in a Melbourne or Sydney paper a glowing
picture of the melancholy event, and then —nothing
more 1 The ill-advised aspirant pays the agent his fee
(£3O to £5O as a rule), waits vainly the proffered engage-
ment, and finally slinks into a corner of the Great City to
hide in voluntary, shamefaced banishment. We have
heard dozens of these would-be artists in London and
Germany, and they will make as little impression on the
artistic world of Europe as S. Smith will on the future
fiscal policy of Australia.

The £2 17s. with which this list opens was higher than
any record between 1894 and 1900. It seems, however, that
under present conditions the limit of improvement has
been reached ; practically earnings have been stationary
for the past two years, and the additions to reserves are
not what they ought to be. In the last three
years nearly 85 per cent, of the profits have
been divided, and the vicissitudes of the National, in
common with most other Australian banks hitherto,
have proved that that is too great a proportion. Com-
paring the position with that disclosed 12 months ago,
the bank appears to have strengthened itself somewhat.
Interest-bearing deposits have increased, non-interest
bearing deposits have been reduced, and advances
have decreased. The situation is partly expressed here-

The increase in public securities is, however, more than
counterbalanced by a reduction in the holding of coin

Nevertheless, very heavy, amounting to just under 40
per cent, of the gross liabilities to the public.

Ex-Governor and now Acting-Agent-General
Jersey is keeping the pot boiling while Henry Copeland
is down this end. “ Out of the £80,000,000 debt of the
State (N.S.YV.),” he tells an interviewer, “£60,000,000
will soon be reproductive, and will not only pay interest,
but will gradually extinguish the principal, and yield a
surplus.” Well, when is it going to start? Part of the
line from Goulburn to Cooma has been opened for 20
years ; but it still turns up with an annual loss of from
£30,000 to £40,000 a year. The Hornsby-Milson’s Point
1 in 3 has been opened, part of it 13 years and the other
part 10, and it still turns up with a loss as
a regular thing. The railway reached Kiama 16
years ago; .yet the deficit is still nearly £30,000
a year. The line from Tamworth to Armidale has been
opened for over 20 years, and it, too, can’t pay working
expenses and interest by £24,000 a year, taking the past
two years’ average. The line to Hay is in the sanje
position, though the loss in that case is less; and there
are a dozen others. What, in the face of these specific
instances, is the use of maundering in this vague fashion
that the works will soon be reproductive ? If we stopped
borrowing, absolutely, now, and built all future works
out of revenue so that earnings would increase without
any corresponding increase of the interest bill, of course
the whole system might soon become reproductive. But
that will never happen while the debt keeps growing
faster than the population, as it is always doing.

have ascertained that the Mond Gas Co. of Staffordshire
have accepted the tender of Mephan Ferguson, of Mel-

Patent Lockingbar Steel Pipes, from 18 inches to 36 inches
diameter. The machinery for manufacturing these pipes
has all been made at Ferguson’s General Engineering
Works, Footscray, and shipped to Tipton, in Staffordshire,
where the branch works are being erected. The same

is to understate the case. It is not merely enormous, it
is unparalleled in the history of the civilised world.
With a population of something under four millions we
had, in 1901-2 (since largely increased), a public debt of
216 millions, or £55 17s. 4d. per head, or, taking one
wage-earner to every five persons, £279 6s. Bd. per
head. On this colossal burden interest has to be paid
to the amount of £2 Os. 6d. per head per annum, or
per adult wage earner, £lO 2s. 6d. Now, as the average
earnings may be put down as less than £2 per week, it
follows that each wage-earner of Australia has to work
more than five weeks each year, or one-tenth of his time,
to pay interest on the public debt. During the last 29
years we have increased our indebtedness, public and
private, by 297 millions, but only 8| millions in money, or
money’s worth, have found their way into Australia.
These figures are so startling that their effect cannot
be at once grasped. Briefly, the position is that out
of 297 millions, all but 8f millions have been swal-
lowed up in payment of interest,charges, etc., so that in
order to get £1 it has been necessary to borrow £33. In
the history of usury was there ever a more terrible pic-
ture? Confronted with such a situation, can the Labor
party be blamed if it declined to be a party to further
borrowing ? ”

As with most banks, apparently, a considerable amount
of deposit-money, which was not bearing interest six
months ago, is now on fixed deposit; but, so far, there has
been no increase in advances to compensate for this. Six
months ago the Colonial, after working for some years on
a rather dangerously small cash reserve, had increased
its hquid assets to 26 per cent, of its liabilities to the
public ; but this proportion has now been reduced to 24
percent., which is no more than it ought to be. Still,
the principal reduction has been in the item “balances
utie from other banks,” which is a very variable asset;
while the reserve of coin and bullion is greater than ever
it was, in recent years, at any rate.

The Westralian Agricultural Bank was
established in the beginning of 1895, under an Act of the
previous November. Funds are provided by the issue of
mortgage bonds, redeemable by annual drawings after
ax years. Three amending Acts have been passed, in-
cluding one, of last year, authorising advances to pay off
existing liabilities ; prior to that, advances could only be
niade for effecting new improvements. But in the
amending law the remarkable provision was included that
a loan could not be wholly used for the purpose of paying
?“ an old debt; one-third of it still has to go into new
improvements. The obvious result is that a farmer,
~gt° pay off £4OO of private mortgage, has to borrow
and thus burden himself with.unnecessary interest,
u uT.u 1 ' 1 the long ru " he nia N be as we H off if he temains
wiin the private money-lender. It seems, from every
point of view, a stupid provision. The repayments (4 per
™nt. per annum) commence at the end of the fifth vear:
interest payable (the maximum) is 5 per cent. Nobodv
can borrow more than £BOO (it used to be £400), and an
advance may not exceed 50 per cent, of the valuation,
mente the morlf ‘ y must all be represented by iinprove-

Eveu now the accounts of the Westralian Agri-
cultural Bank are not perfectly presented, there beingonly
a profit and loss statement and no balance-sheet; but in
tne earlier years, the statements were very inadequate,
certainly that wasn’t surprising ; the entire staff con-
sisted of a manager and a clerk, and they had to do all
tneir own inspecting and valuing, which entailed much
traveUmg. It is possible, however, to follow the course
°t the transactions this far :

The considerable increase in the expense rate during the
year has probably been due to the very large increase in
the number of applications, in respect of which so far the
actual advances have been small. The amount of interest
unpaid, if any, is not stated ;so far, however, only £7 has
been written off as bad.

The demand of certain of the Chinese boss
cabinetmakers in Melbourne, that the unionists should
pledge themselves not to work for men who didn’t belong
to the Chinese boss cabinetmakers’ union, has a fairly
well-known counterpart in the North of England, where
they call it an “E. J. Smith Combination." E. J. Smith
was a Brummagem brass bedstead-maker, who worked up
a combine in his trade with this understanding as part of
its basis. The other most important part of the basis of
this kind of combine is that the manufacturers agree not
to sell below a certain fixed minimum profit. In the
Brummagem Bedstead Association the minimum used to
be 10 per cent., but the Bedstead had a keen eye for 25
per cent, when it could be got.

Yet, when he opened his great Freetrade campaign the
other day, George Reid had the gall to say that the
bloated protected manufacturer could afford to pay a big
salary to a political organising secretary, while the poor,
crushed importing person couldn’t afford such luxury.

How Russia advances ! Cabled that though in
'9B England imported but 2678 tons of Siberian butter, it
last year took 44,642 tons. Besides that huge mass of
grease, how trifling looks Victoria’s last year’s total
export, foreign and interstate* of 6714 tons. To give
Victoria a chance against Siberian butter of equal quality
Britain would have to impose an ad valorem duty on the
latter of 44 per cent.—4 per cent, to counterbalance the
difference in freight and 40 per cent, to make up for the
higher cost of production in Victoria, which is not so
much owing to high wages as to the crushing demands of
rack-renting land-grabbers. With the landlord abolished
Victoria might compete against Siberia with the aid of a
very small preference.

The March-September half-year is the period when the
community’s thirst isn’t equal to long beers, and Tooth’s
profits usually decline in consequence. This year the
gross profits have declined rather more than usual; but
as outgoings have been pared down also, the visible
results have not gone far to the bad. Practically the
whole of the reserves are invested apart from the busi-
ness; deposits, N.S.W. stock, debentures, and accrued
interest account for £124,322, and bank balances for
£19,647. The usual £SOOO has been deducted for depre-
ciation.

Reported by a London paper (October): “The
excessive borrowing indulged in during recent years by
municipal corporations and colonial Governments has
been largely instrumental in producing a curious and
exasperating condition of things in the banking world.
Many of the great London banks have locked up so much
of their resources in such loans that they find themselves
unable to accommodate legitimate private borrowers.
Quite recently a leading London bank positively refused
to advance a few thousands of pounds against ample
security in the shape of Consols. The security was per-
fect, the risk would have been nil, and the margin of
profit excellent. Yet the bank was unable to look at the
business, for the simple reason that it had not the money
to lend.” If those conditions continue, the chances of the
Victorian £5,000,000 loan are very poor indeed. The
banks that won’t lend on Consols are not likely to lend
on the strength of Bent’s blast, and Irvine’s cool, calm,
strong ignorance of the law.

The Colonial Permanent’s capital is £48,000, so on paper
it has still £28,547 intact; but it does not look as though
there will be much of it left by the time all the assets
are realised. The principal assets are advances and fore-
closed properties ; and these have lately moved as
follows:

1900 £84,559 _ _

1902 76,728 4978 1244
1903 72,201 4527 3668
The amount of £IOOS was a writing off ; the others were
losses on securities realised. Apparently, therefore, in the
last two years, assets which stood in the books at £0505
have been got rid of for £4593 ; and as there are £72,201
more of such securities to realise, the outlook for the
shareholders’ remaining £28,547 is not very promising.
Meantime, however, the outside creditors are being
slowly paid off—paid off as fast as the realisation of
securities will allow. The movement has been lately:

This past year about £4 (book value) of assets have thus
had to go in order to pay off £1 of creditor; and that
can t be regarded as anything brilliant in the way of
liquidation.

The Newcastle Building and Investment
Go. (Newcastle, N.S.W.) took over the Newcastle Per-
manent Investment and Building Society in 1896. It has
a paid capital of £83,888 ; and apparently most of this was
put into a contingency fund to cover losses on the old
co.’s properties (over £IOO,OOO book value) as they are
disposed of. The recent progress is shown hereunder:

The reserves consist of £42,816 contingency fund (created,
wholly or chiefly, out of capital, as stated above) and
£8753 undivided profits ; and it is about time a good slice
of the latter was turned into a formal reserve fund, a
large floating balance being an unsafe and unsatisfactory
way of keeping a reserve. During the past year the
losses on property sold and the writings-off amounted to
£650; but an item of £424, which has for several years
figured as “ borrowers’ bonus ” in the balance-sheet, has
now been credited to the contingency fund, making the
net loss £226. The process of realisation of properties
appears to be going on satisfactorily. The following
shows the total amount due by properties at the end of
each period:—
1899 .. .. £108,576
1900 .. 101,243
1901 .. 83,756
1902 .. .. £78,177
1903 .. .. 73,941
Ia four years, it appears, £34,635 (book value) of proper-
ties have been realised, and the amount shown as lost
and written off has only been £5230. In the same period
the amounts due by borrowers have come down from
£36,837 to £21,519. If the liquidation of the old concern can
proceed on these lines the contingency fund will more than
cover losses; in fact, the further losses, on that basis,
would amount to only £12,000 or so. Current business is
also profitable ; the return in the past year was equal to
£6 16s. 9d. on the paid capital.

There are grave fears in S. Australia that wine-
production has outstripped the demand. The average
vintage in 1898-1899-1900 was 1,388,500 gallons; in the
past three years, it was 2,606,000 gallons, and there are
now over 5£ million gallons in stock. In the past 12
months stocks have increased by 508,000 gallons, although
the 1903 vintage was only 142,000 gallons more than that
for 1902. A large brandy-making and exporting industry
is wanted to use up the surplus.

The heavy writing-down during the year seems to have
been a general process, applied to all, or nearly all, the
assets ; the amount has come off the contingency fund.
The reserves now consist of contingency fund £7346, and
undivided profit, £1431. The dividend, it will be noticed,
has been put up £ per cent. It is at least un-
fortunate that the increase comes at a time when
it is found necessary to write off actually more than
the entire profits of the year. Still, if the writing-down
process is now complete (though as to that there can’t be
any certainty in any case), the increase, though prema-
ture, would not be a very wrong proceeding, seeing that
the business profits are at the rate of £6 9s. per cent, on
the capital.

In the matter of coal export Newcastle (N.S.W.)
is putting up a record this year. First nine months’
shipments totalled 2,663,671 tons, against 2,222,646 tons
to September 30 last year. For the year the figures will,
it is expected, be 100,000 tons ahead of the previous best,
which was the 3,100,000 tons of 1901. The declared value’
has, however, averaged a trifle less this year than last—
9s. 3d. against 9s. lid. But even this year’s price is 3s.
better than the average for 1898.

Broken Hill Water Co.’s reservoir never held
more water than there is in it at present. Every other
tank and dam on the field is also full—some of the B.H.
Prop.’s for the first time. The Water 00. has no rating
powers ;it is paid only for what water is used. And as
the demand will be very small for the next six months at
least, the co.’s profits will be also small for this half-year
and next. That the reservoir contains so many thousands
of millions of gallons doesn’t really mean as - much as it
looks, because after it has had, say, 750 million gallons
poured into it, the rest has to spread out over
a flat plain, and it is all gone before the end of the
first summer. On July Ist, 1899, there were 1,456,128,000
gallons impounded; by the end of December, only
779,896,000 gallons were left, although only 94,350,000
gallons were sold in the interval. The other 581,882,000
gallons were lost by evaporation. This exposes the weak
point in the Owe’Sullivan scheme for improving the
Broken Hill supply. That scheme, recommended by the
Works Committee, is simply the diversion of other
waters into this same flat, shallow reservoir, instead of
the erection of another dam across the much deeper,
and therefore more permanent, Yancowinna Creek.

Broken Hill mining co.s’ advices are that the
zinc market is unusually strong, with excellent prospects.
There are no stocks of Ihe metal to speak of; and, in
America especially, the old main sources of supply have
been failing. The B.H. co.’s are, therefore, straining to
get their crude zinc tailings in a fit state for the market.
The Australian Metal Co.’s plant is at work steadily,
mainly on Block 10 tailings; the Sulphide Corporation
has a magnetic plant of its own running; and Block 11 is
hurrying on a mill on anew pattern. But, after all, the
co.s’ profits are small. Practically, the whole of the pro-
duct has to be exported to Europe to be smelted; and
most of the money goes to the smelters.

Bendigo hasn’t left off floating co.s even now,

George Lansell, of Bendigo, working the 180
mine.“on his own,” is now breaking out stone at 3310 ft.
—which is probably as deep as any mine-owner working
single-handed ever got. He deserves something better
than the 7dwt. he is getting. Still there is sft. of work-
able material at the level, with a large area to explore
yet. A couple of hundred feet higher the New
Chum and Victoria has Bft. of stone, averaging about
half an ounce ; and this co; also has a lot of promising
ground still available thereabouts.
* * * ♦
One fairly large item in the expenses of the
deep-sinking pioneer, who can’t always get contributions
towards it from his neighbors, is the haulage of water.
New Chum Railway (Bendigo), which is now keeping
itself warm at a depth of 3896 ft., lifts a million gallons a
month from 3500 ft.—and 3500 ft. is a long lift. This, of
course, is exclusive of the quantity raised from shallower
levels, which totals almost as much.

The Sydney Board of Health warns the
public against collecting oysters in parts of
Middle Harbor; that arm of Port Jackson is now
greatly contaminated by sewage. Oysters retailed
opened in bottles (a common enough practice) are,
to an extent, dangerous, no matter where they
come from. Once the oyster is taken from its
shell it dies and decomposition sets in very
rapidly. The bottled oyster is thus liable to
cause fish-poisoning.

* Geelong has waited 13 years for some
Government to put a clock in the post office
tower and does not despair of getting the job
done yet. Just now its hopes centre in Philip
Fysh, who is expected to get the clock and pass
the bill on to the Commonwealth. Meanwhile
the attention of Geelong has been unkindly drawn
to the fact that the law fully authorises any town
to buy its own clock and put the same up on the
Commonwealth’s post office, and Geelong has been
assured that no obstacles will be put in its way.
Governor Le Hunte, a resolutely energetic
person, recently tried a quick-traveiling record on
the S.A. railways. On Wednesday he did the
usual Executive Council in the morning, and the
also usual suburban flower show in the afternoon,
and then dashed back to the city to catch the
Melbourne express. It dropped him during the
night, and he fled along bye lines till at 10 a.m. he
was at Mount Gambier. There he put in a long
day of various functions, and at night started
back on the 300 miles journey to Adelaide, which
was reached early Friday morning. That after-
noon he was off again by the Northern train to
inspect the Bundaleer water-works. And when
he got back from there, ready to drop from
exhaustion, he had done less really useful work
than a man who has made a candle or patched a
pair of boots. The flower show would have been
just as open if he hadn’t opened it. Mount Gam-
bier would have been just as well if he hadn’t
visited it. The water-works would have been
just as wet if he hadn’t inspected them. A
Governor is the largest and most expensive bum-
ble bee—the buzz part of the bumble bee that is—
in this country. He is worn out inspecting things,
looking at things, making useless speeches about
things. He has to buzz himself to death. If lie
is a man of any brain his intelligence rusts, and
his brain becomes sodden, and he loses the ability
to do any good in the endless round of silly use-
lessness. It is the same as if an able man, as a
reward for past services, were hired at a large
salary to stand on the verandah and call out
“ cock-a-doodle ” for 10 hours a day until the con-
stant repetition of “ cock-a-doodle ” reduced him
to a crowing automaton.

There is a little extra inwardness about
M'Eacharn’s new position as Lord Mayor of
Melbourne. M'Eacharn, as a mere candidate for
the Melbourne seat in the Representatives, is only
allowed to spend £lOO on his election, but
M‘Eacharn, as Lord Mayor of Melbourne, can
spend anything he likes in the purchase of a loud
shriek of popularity. M'Eacharn the Rep. can’t
banquet his constituents, but Mayor M'Eaoharn
can banquet Representative M'Eacharn’s consti-
tuents to any extent, and the vittles are always
liable to rise up and testify on his behalf at the
poll, no matter which M'Eacharn supplies them.
Vittles are vittles, no matter how they are come
by.

Dr. Leeper’s heated opposition to the
proposal to make attendance on lectures compul-
sory at Melbourne University, arises from the
fact that he is Warden of Trinity College, which
has a system of lectures of its own, and Trinity
students attend many of these lectures instead of
those delivered at the University itself. As
several of the Trinity’s, as well as the other col-
leges’, lectures are better than those of the Uni-
versity, Dr. Leeper has good reason to object to
an innovation that will compel his students to
attend inferior lectures at the rival emporium.

home, but having no one to
perform that friendly office for himself, was
“ run in ” by a hostile policeman. Next morning
the J.P. fined him 2s. Gd. for intoxication without
a smile on his large, circular countenance.

Maoriland Marine and Customs depart-
ments issued formal notices of protest against the
launching of Tanner’s beer barrel barge, built to
go round the world, because the Government
surveyor wouldn’t pas 3 the cranky-looking
arrangement. Then a bailiff seized the show, and
as soon as he was paid off it capsized. The
official launching was a humorous affair. A young
lady smashed a champagne bottle containing tea,
and christened the ark. Someone, whose identity
wasn’t discoverable, promptly kissed her and dis-
appeared. Tanner gave a pathetic farewell
address, in which he incidentally alluded to his
pitent method of hanging murderers on the stage.
Then the Hollow Mockery put out to sea, but made
no headway, and it was so badly ballasted that
a boat went out and towed it back again. After
that it bumped badly, and it is now understood to
be quite dead.
THREE OF THEM.
MRS. SMITH: “So glad to see you, Mrs. Bosslcy; and I see you've "brought your poodles.”
MR. BOOSLEY (sotto voce): “Yes, be gad! we're all here.”
The Cali. (San Francisco) lately sympa*
thised with this country after the following
fashion :
Australia seems destined to presertt the world with
aco itinuous show of social problems. Her latest in that
line is a census report revealing a birthrate so low that
it barely exceeds that of France. Sociologists are having
a hard time in their efforts to find out the cause of the
low rate. . . . None of the present theories of the cause
of a decline in birthrate fits the requirements of the
Australian situation. The Australians are not a weak, a
decadent, nor a degenerate people. On the contrary,
they are the first descendants of a race of pioneers, and
all the world knows that pioneers are among the
strongest of men and women. Nevertheless, the facts
are indisputable. ... It seems to be a land where the
race suicide is practised as part of the general scheme of
State socialism, and perhaps the two things may be more
closely related than appears on the surface.
This is rough, coming from San Francisco. The
United States is so backward in some things that
it actually preserves no records of the birth and
death rates of the country at large. Still, there
are city records, and the staggering fact is
presented that the birth-rate of San Francisco is
only about half that of Sydney—in fact there is
hardly a United States city that comes within
gunshot of any Australian city as regards births.
And San Francisco, of all places on earth, sympa-
thises with us, and sets it down to “socialistic
legislation.”

John Norton’s family paper hits a number
of large nails on the head in the following (on the
Loss of Infant Life in Victoria):
With a gross population of only about 1,200,000, a
yearly loss of 4275 promising “kiddies” is appalling—
especially in a country like this, with a healthy climate
and a fertile area, capable, if properly opened up and
cultivated, of easily supporting from 15,000,000 to
20,000,000 of people.' Yet nobody, apparently, seems to
care—let alone propound some workable scheme to save
this awful drain of young lives. In this parson-cursed,
hypocritical and canting community, any proposal to
lighten the burden of the unfortunate girl with an “ille-
gitimate ” (God save the mark!) baby; any idea of refuges,
foundling homes, or of help and sympathy to “fallen”
women ; any attempt at recognition of the facts that, all
child-bearing women are heroines to whom the State is in
debt; and all children (whole and sound in wind and
limb) welcome, whether they have come before, or after,
or without any ceremony, or waving of hands and uttering
of words over their parents— any such proposal, we say,
is hushed and hished into indignant and prudish silence,
as if it were something quite remote from human interest
and of as much moment as the price of old bottles. And
consequently 42,750 of our babies, or the vast majority of
them, are passed out of a hard, cold world every decade
by starvation, strangling, neglect, exposure, or the
Yarra.
The Maoriland slieep-stealer is a cheerful
fragment. The other day, at Wellington, two
youthful individuals were charged with having
bagged a lonely lamb out Mangahararu way, and
one of them handed to Justice Cooper a fearful
poem in five verses which he bad composed in the
lock-up. The “ poem ” threw no new light on the
case ; it seemed to be simply another evidence of
the tendency in this young country to dash off a
few lines on small provocation.

The most shocked female Reform politician
in N.S.W., so far, is she who wrote to quite a
harmless-looking Labor member, who seemed to
be interested in the State Children’s Relief Bill.
Her friendly little note embodied a few sugges
tions ; and she got this in reply :
Thanks for memo duly receivei. Would like to gel
details. Will be doing a loaf on the Ocean Beach to-
morrow morning from 9to 9.30. Perhaps we could chat
the matter over there.
But, when she read the appalling letter at a meet-
ing, an interjector told her it might have been
worse; the quiet reformer might have want'd
to talk it over on the beach between 9 and 9.30

Wept till her low lament

It will be interesting to see whether
Premier Seddon, of Maoriland, will find his long-
postponed Waterloo in his new Licensing Bill.
He proposes to partly abolish the elective charac-
ter of the licensing boards by making the mayor
or chairman of the county council a member.
This is a concession to the publicans, but not
much of a concession. It is also provided that the
local option vote shall deal only with the question
of maintenance of the present licenses or total
abolition; and, as the people who used to vote
for reduction would probably, under such circum-
stances, vote for abolition, this looks like a
concession to teetotallers. Further, the Bill
provides that no liquor is to be taken into
prohibition districts (though how all the
police in Maoriland can keep it out it is
difficult to see), but tourists may get drink-
ing permits and be supplied at Government
emporiums. When the resident, who hasn’t had
a drink for two years, and can’t get one for love
or money, and. who is liable to fine or imprison-
ment if liquor is even smelt on his premises, sees
a complete stranger getting cheerfully drunk in a
Government establishment set up for the express
purpose, the remarks of that local resident should
be worth listening to. Seddon says his Bill is
only designed to satisfy the moderate people, but
there aren’t enough moderate people left in
Maoriland now to keep any Government in office.
Psearly everybody is rampant on one side or the
other. Moderate men are about as scarce now as
blue giraffes.

The cablegrams about “Elijah” Dowie,
the wing-flapper, and his sect —the crusade of
3000 Zionists to New York, their dispersion into
cheap boarding-houses while the preacher went to
a big hotel, the fact that 1500 of them have got a
sordid cold in the nose, the prophet’s violent
assurances that they wouldn’t have cold in the
nose if they had “more faith,” the prophet’s rush
for the police when his wife lost a jewel, when he
should have kept calm and gotthe property back by
faith, the prophet’s own cold and his failure to c-ure
himself by faith—all these things don’t promise
well for Dowie’s approaching visit to Australia.
No church which has such a terrible cold in its
nose can be taken seriously—in fact, a church, in
its capacity as a church, shouldn’t allude to its
nose at all. Australia will think of Zion now as
the creed with the snuffles.

A somewhat battered individual, with one
leg and one feasible explanation, was discovered
stowed away on a Tasmanian steamer, last week.
According to his own account, he had lost his
limb at the Spion Kop fight. He was invalided
back to England, and, of course, found his job
gone and his best girl married to the other fellow,
i nen lie moved to Australia, and found the war
enthusiasm as dead as Captain Cook’s image, and
the demand for one-legged heroes nil. Now he
wants to get back to England again, and stamp
lus remaining leg on his native heath. Let’s see,
now, what war was it that Spion Kop figured in?
And who was Mr. Kop, anyhow ?

A letter from Hobart:—
The Count; Vay de Vaya and so forth has been staying
with Governor Havelock at Tasmanian Government
House and astonishing the Flyspeck natives with his
gorgeous clothes and princely ways. He lectured at
Hobart Town Hall last week—limelight views—and the
girls went in crowds “ to see his clothes,” as they said.
The Count mounted the platform in a long black cassock
open, in the front, and showing underneath his scarlet
robes, likewise divers crosses and medals and other
decorations of Kings, Emperors, Shahs, Mikados, Aider-
men and so on. Then the Count began to talk about
Asia with the lights up, and the girls were dis-
appointed that he kept the black cassock on.
Presently the lights were lowered, and Nat Oldham
began to throw pictures on the screen. Then after
half-an-hour the lights went up again, and, lo and behold,
there was the count in all the uneclipsed nakedness of
his scarlet glory—from chin to great toe. In the
dark, he had taken off the black cassock, and he burst
upon the audience in his dazzling raiment of red with the
many-colored electric lights above. A subdued “Oh!”
was heard here and there, and when the count threw
himself into an armchair and went on talking to the
people, as if he were in a drawing-room, he had captured
the crowd-girls and all. A. J. Taylor, the public
ibrarian, whispered to a friend that the next time he
lectured on small-pox and vaccination, or the cure of con-
sumption, he’d sit all the time and wear his Humane

Auckland (M.L.) has been stirred to the
bottom of its Scotch by terian soul. For weeks
past the sinful proposal to run the street trains on
the Sawbath has been the subject of much
prayerful consideration, and eventually Auckland
decided to take a vote upon it. It was a great
struggle. The tram people ran at concession rates
all day, with special free rides for voters; and,
instead of the usual exhortations concerning
whisky and pills, they carried great placards—
vote for the Sunday tram, the people’s car-
riage.” The painfully holy were assisted bv the
cab owners and drivers, who wanted all" the
Sabbath-breaking to themselves, and whipped up
every available voter on the other side] and when
it was all over the crowds that blocked the streets
in front of the newspaper offices learned that the
devil and the tram co. had won by 22 votes in a
pod of 8000.
THE LAST STRAW.
"La sakes! I wonder be
that umbrella mendin' a
payin’ game?”
A Sydney paper in a recent article on a
charitable institution, detailed a “ pathetic ” case
of child abandonment. The mother of the infant,
a girl of 17 years, was found and admitted with
her baby into the Home. Next the father was
traced, and the committee got his promise to
marry the girl he had betrayed and deserted.
And then the committee of well-meaning old
twaddlers struck a snag; the girl refused with
contempt and utter loathing to have anything to
do with the man who had meanly left her in the
lurch. But at last, under brutal threats that she
would be imprisoned for child desertion if she
didn’t marry him, she consented and sold her
body, partly for the sake of “respectability,” but
mostly to keep herself out of gaol, and went away
to start a life of married misery. And the joint
and several twaddly old cats of the institution
cast the old boot of congratulation after the pair,
and then went inside to lick its tail with the
proud consciousness that it had done the right
thing. Many strange things are done in the name
of charity.

Somebody is making quite a disturbance
about the burial of a deceased cancer patient on
the catchment area of Sydney water supply.
Westralian Government runs most of the
hospitals of the State, and treats the nurses
scandalously. The pay is from £5O to £GO
a year, and the nurses must pay for their own
laundry work, except as regards their official uni-
forms. When travelling they are only allowed
second-class passes; and in W.A. —a country of
great journeys and terrible heat—it is sheer
cruelty to ask women to travel second-class for
long distances.
• • • •
More disgraceful things are told about the
treatment of the insane in Westralia. There are
no padded rooms in the State’s one asylum, and
when a patient develops violent tendencies the
best they can do for him is to force him into a
straight-jacket. Patients with homicidal ten-
dencies have to be treated in the same way when
they are turned out for an airing ; there is no
separate accommodation for them, so the asylum
people have either to truss them in canvass, or
keep them shut up without an airing, or risk a
daily murder. Under this brutal system the
chance of patients recovering their serises falls to
somewhere about zero.
* * * •
The papers are full of the wails of Sydney
Harbor Trust and the Water and Sewerage Board
at the action of the Government in reducing their
estimates. In a laudable spasm of economy the
Government cut down the appropriations of the
Trust and the Board for the next financial year.
The Board straightway stopped some of its
most important and most needed works, while the
Trust abolished the scavenging work under its
control. They might have attempted to distri-
bute the reduction over the whole of the services,
and so minimised the effect, but they didn’t.’
Instead they waited on the Premier with the
remark that by reducing these votes the Board
was threatened with typhoid, and the Trust
expected plague. The Premier hints at giving in.
There is an enthusiastic demand for economy and
curtailment of expenditure, with a unanimous
opinion that the other fellow should curtail.

Maoriland sailors have struck the “T”
superstition again ; the launch Toroa is missing,
and is supposed to have been added to the harvest
of Mr. D. Jones. Other notable “T ” boats that
have gone amiss are: Tasmanu. (foundered at Table
Cape), Taranaki, lasmauian Maid, Triumph
(piled up on the rocks at Tiritiri), Taupo, Tararua,
Tauranga and Faiaroa. The Government vessel
Tutanekai has not yet had its turn, but seamen
are not rushing lor berths in it.
Just as the warm weather is setting in, the
publicans of Melbourne threaten to increase the
price of a pint of beer to 4d. (This branch of the
trouble started with the brewers, who decided to
raise the price of a hogshead from £2 lss. to £3 55.)
The publicans also want to abolish the counter-
lunch swindle (except as regards bread and cheese
and biscuits, and these only within certain hours).
They aren’t unanimous, but those of them
who are unanimous (which is an Irish way
of putting it) are urging the brewers to stop
beer supplies to any publican who sells at
less than 4d. a pint, or gives counter-lunches. So
far, it doesn't seem to have dawned on anybody
that the whole scheme is utterly illegal—as per
the famous Tatf Vale decision ; also that it is air
“ unwarrantable restriction of private enterprise,”
and a “ gross interference with the liberty of the
subject,” besides being a mutual agreement of an
outrageously socialistic character.

The “send for the police” superstition
again. At the inquiry touching the death of the
woman who suicided horribly by burning at Bris-
bane, the other day, a witness stated :
Deceased’s grandson, Howard, awoke him early that
morning, and he went out, and at a distance of about
26ft. he saw a dark object lying at full length amidst the
flames. He decided that the woman was dead, hurriedly
put on some clothes, and went over to Holcroft’s. The
latter had been alarmed by the boy before witness
arrived, had looked over the fence, and satisfitd himself
that the woman was dead. Holcroft and witness imme-
diately went for Constable Gilroy, thinking that if they
meddled with the body they might get into trouble.

A Birmingham (Eng.) solicitor has been
sentenced to seven years’ penal servitude for
maliciously w-ounding a horse. He was recom-
mended to mercy by a jury of snobs, on account of
his position. The Chairman of Quarter Sessions
evidently considered, and very properly, his posi-
tion an aggravation of the offence, and took no
notice of the recommendation.

London Daily Express has been publish-
ing a number of articles on the famous Druce
case. One of these contains an affidavit by Mrs.
Hamilton, a chief witness in the case. In the
course of her statements, Mrs. H., in order to
prove her bona fides it would seem, declares “I
am a god-daughter of his Grace the late fourth
Duke of Portland, and suffer from the skin-disease
common to the Bentinck family.” The pride of
the lady ! Anything to prove a connection with
the aristocracy. But the Bentinck brand of
scrofula must be pretty powerful if it can be
communicated to god-children.

Some North Queensland towns received a
paralysing blow lately—word came up from the
South that the Sunday trading law was to be
observed strictly. That part of the force which
had been stationed up there for any length of
time had a vague idea that there was a Sunday,
but wasn't posted up in details, and had to spend
a severe day or two reading up the statutes; the
rest of the population viewed the situation
blankly. The publicans were so terrified on dis-
covering Sunday that they shut up their premises
hard and fast when the day came round, and when
a traveller came along and wanted a drink he was
referred to the local constable. If the constable
gave a certificate, well and good; if he didn’t,
then the traveller had to hang out his tongue in
the street until morning.

A Melbourne lady created something of a
sensation in Collins-street during the week by
appearing in a most transparent bodice with,
apparently, nothing but bare woman underneath.
Friends have since rallied round her and declared
that it was a flesh-colored slip bodice, but the
effect was the same, anyhow. Probably that
woman would drop dead from shocked modesty if
you mentioned the leg of the table in her hearing.

A successor to Dean Cowper is hard to
find for St. Andrew’s, Sydney. The chief reason
is that “influence” wants to import a man from
England, while “numbers” are. for filling the post
locally. In all such cases “numbers” should
withstand “influence” to its beard.
A resident near a Victorian State school
that has got the Jingo disease badly, complains in
a Melbourne morning journal that life is made
hideous to him by the children being taught to
the sound of bells, trumpets and kettledrums.
During four days a week, he says, the formula is
as follows -
About 9 a.m.—The bell for some minutes, then the
trumpets. About 9.2o.—The bell, then the trumpets,
then the whistle (many times). About 9.30. —The kettle-
drum and trumpets, for some time. About 11.—The bell.
About 11.15. —The bell, the trumpets, whistle, then the
kettledrum and trumpets for some time. About 12. —
Bell. About lp.m.—Bell; then trumpets. About 1.20.
Bell, trumpets, whistle. About 1.30. —Kettledrum and
trumpets, for some time. About 2.35. —Bell, trumpets,
About 2.45.—8e11; then trumpets, whistle. About 3. —
Kettledrum and trumpets, for some time. About 3.30,
and later.—Bell.
With all this military bang, shout and tintinna-
bulation, there is Very little time left to educate
the kic's.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, October 27, 1903.
My Deab Abini,—
A curious tragedy chanced recently on a P. and
O. boat. An old lady always sat on an air
pillow while on deck. She left it on her chair one
day while she went below, and in her absence a
festive gentleman hit another festive gentleman
on the head with it, and it burst. They both
abased themselves before the old lady and
promised to buy an improved air-pillow at next
port, but she wept bitterly and refused to be
comforted. The late lamented, it appeared, had
blown up the pillow before he died, and now his
breath had escaped, and no pillow blown up by a
stranger could ever fill the place of the exploded
relic.
The favorite topic at an aftemoon-tea congress
of Women used to be the love affairs of their
friends, or even-of well-known persons whom they
merely knew by repute. Not scandalous gossip,
yon know, but gossip of engagements and affairs
of the heart. The subject next in popularity was
the servant question. Nov.’, this current minute,
Cupid and Mary Jane are obsolete as gossip
topics, and women are talking physical culture.
They may have souls to save ; they are sure they
have figures to preserve, or retrieve, or improve.
One reason of the popularity of physical cul-
ture in talk and practice rests with the papers—
not necessarily women’s papers—that give space to
interviews with, and paragraphs about, celebrated
artistes. These ladies are invariably asked,
“ What is your favorite form of exercise ? ”
Locally, Miss Ada Crossley has given the subject
a very smart fillip. You hear now, on all sides,
of “the Ada Crossley figure,” or of some woman
who is by way of being elegant, “she’s cultivat-
ing the Ada Crossley carriage ! ”
One exasperating characteristic of the local
physioal culturist is that she doesn’t cult her feet
at all. Both sets of toes continue turned in, or,
what really looks more absurd, one is turned in.
Her one aim is to reduce her waist or hips by so
many inches, or to increase her arm or shoulder
girth, or pad her neck-bone—she treats her feet as
though they were the property of her dearest foe.
A day or so ago" as I was musing on this theme,
and thinking how well Mr. G. H. Reid’s turned-in
toes suited him, I tripped over an Emersonism
that bears somewhat on the subject: “ Give me a
thought, and my hands and legs and face and
voice will all go right. We are awkward for
want of thought—the inspiration is scanty and
does not arrive at the extremities.” It is not
often that the sage makes one laugh—he does in
this case.
Walk up Geo?ge-street with your mind full of a
fine, white Thought for, say, the betterment of
the human race, and, even though you be an Ada
Crossley double, you’ll presently carry yourself
like a duck full of alcoholised wheat. All the
time, on the other side of the road, one of the
“Toreador” chorus girls is walking like a goddess,
because she is thinking of how she walks and
looks. “Yes, lam pointing my toes correctly
How well my new silk underskirts look in the
street mirrors! lam a peach ! ”
Concerning figures. Paquin, the famous French
dressmaker (Paquin is the only quote now
not Worth) writing “shop” in the Daily Mail,’
gives a diagram with measurements of what he
considers the perfect female figure, the one he
loves to dress. This figure is about five feet five
in height, with a 21in. waist, 37in. hips, and 36in.
bust. A real French dressmaker’s figure: 21in.
waist ! What about that Venu3 de Medici with
its 26in. waist ?
October, which on the authority of an Australian
poet has “flower-trammelled feet,” yielded her
annual rose-show just prior to walking out of the
calendar upon the feet afore-mentioned. Lady
Rawson opened it. A rose called the “Ernest
Metz ” took champion prize. It was a perfectly
formed, three-parts-opened flower of a creamy
complexion, suffused in the centre petals with a
dull, peachy pink. It was grown by the gardener
of the Walker Hospital. Peonies so fine that
they were mistaken by some for rhododendrons
were on view. The prize bridal bouquet had
puffs of tulle or some such gossamery thing intro-
duced into its make-up. From the roses, Lady
Rawson went to the Sacerdotal Smiths’ garden
party, and the usual S.S. garden-party weather
went also. Whenever the Primate gives an out-
door splash it rain tanks.
Talking of things that grow—on stems—l saw
a mushroom lately that weighed 21b., and was as
big as a dinner-plate. It was grown from mush-
room spawn, at Pyrmont. A while ago, in a Melb
weekly, among a series of articles, “Little
Industries for Women,” was one in which mush-
room-growing was described in an alluring fashion
as a money-making industry. Someone who is
sick of music-teaching at a guinea a quarter, and
who has a cellar, ought to give it a trial. A dis-
used railway tunnel is a good place to grow
mushrooms, but all the tunnels I know are in use
just now.
Mr. Justice Cohen’s household gods and goddesses
—he had an adorable bust of Pallas Athene
and marbles of the Medici Milo and Canova
Venus—were distributed by auction sale this
week. Mrs. Cohen takes their eldest son to
Oxford presently, and as this climate was never
kind to.herself, she will remain away from it for a
long while.
An application was lately made to the Court in
London, to gaol Lady Mary Dundas, formerly
Lady Mary Bertie, daughter of an Earl,
and sister of the gorgeous personage who
w*? .yde-do-oamped for Governor Carrington in
N.S.W., for persistent failure to pay for her
clothes. The bill was only for £2B, and an order
for the lady’s committal to gaol had been hanging
over her head for six years. Therefore it seems
that her credit in the matter of clothes came to
an end in 1897, and presumably her wardrobe has
been very scanty ever since. During the six
years that the order for committal to a common,
sordid dungeon had been suspended by one horse-
hair, and liable to drop at any moment, she had
married, but apparently she married a man
who didn’t feel inclined to pay £2B, and none
of her relatives came to her relief. Since
1897 she managed to pay £5 off the account
—money raised by selling a table. The Court
didn t send the lady to gaol, but it left the order
for committal still in existence, and it seems as if
she would get to Holloway prison in the long run,
unless the British aristocracy sends the hat round.
Her family has been in the earl business for
nearly 300 years, so hers is *a rather ancient name
to scrub out a cell with.
Mrs. Molyneux Parkes, one of the political
women, in a recent address to her feller-wimmen
and male trash generally, 'said that it promised
well for politics that so many “high-minded,
conscientious and cultured women now braved
the unpleasantness of publicity and took a
forward part in political affairs.’’ “Unpleasant-
ness of publicity,” forsooth ! Why there’s
hardly one of us (who hasn’t an absolute
hump) that didn’t, at one time or other, yearn
extremely to go on the stage. All the theatri-
cal managers are inundated with applications
from women (“high-minded, conscientious and
cultured women,” as well as other kinds too
numerous to mention) desiring publicity for their
this or that accomplishment—lyric, histrionic, or
j ust leg. Most women find publicity very pleasant
(so long as it’s of the kind that attracts admiration
or envy). If they didn’t, the “ Society ” column
would not have a place in almost every newspaper.
One of the reasons why there are so few really
capable women heading the women’s political
movement is that the rdle isn’t showy enough.
There isn’t enough publicity in it. If it were the
correct thing to deliver political addresses in
tights I believe the business would look up.
Mr. Jack Dailey, eon of our late W. B. of that
name, intends to stand for Wentworth, the seat
just vacated by Mr. M‘Millan, who, I suppose,
thinks that, the tariff issue being settled now for
a while, he can leave the championship of drapery
to others. Mr. Dailey, of course, comes out in
the National interest—else would old man Dailey
turn in his grave.
Mr. Ernest Tyson’s real elegant motor car is an

“For Love and Life ” is the motto of the Civil
Ambulance and Transport Brigade, and anybody
who helps an organisation of that sort deserves
praise. Last week at Sydney Boyal, the amateur
combination, self-styled “The Muffs,” presented
‘ The Honeymoon ” in aid of C. A.T.8., and now
I confess to a great desire to see the centenarian
blank-verse comedy done by first-class profes-
sionals. Aranza and his bride, Juliana, are, in
another guise, Petrucliio and Katherine of “The
Taming of the Shrew.” To marry a wife and
deliberately start to play the iron master by her
from the moment you get outside the church
portals, to lock her up and give her peasant’s
clothes to wear, to act the upper and the nether
millstone by her, and to do all this in the name of
love for her as a gentleman and a duke—the
impudence of the venture is too colossal.
As is usual in amateur productions, the women
were better than the men ; but, in this case, the
best of the caste was Mr. A. Teacher, as the low-
comedy mock-duke. Miss Lilian Bethell, Miss
Edith Shepherd and Miss Elsie Prince gave a
good account of themselves, and when they weren’t
very good they were pretty all the time—and
what woman, if she had to make a choice, wouldn’t
rather be pretty than good ?—in amateur theatri-
cals, of course. Performance realised £lOO. There
was a crowded and fashionable house.
Madame Christian’s pupils have formed them-
selves into an operatic society, and intend pro-

Miss Little, an American contralto, daughter

Miss Ada Crossley, who has appeared at Albury

Last Monday Mayoress Hughes presided at a

Kendall for the collection of funds to buy some
presentation jewel—turquoises and diamonds—for
the contralto. Other day someone asked Ada
what she would really like, and she replied, “a
week’s sleep.” Subscriptions for the t. and d.
ornament are fixed at from two to five shillings.
Manly brightens up this sorry Scheme of Things
with mixed bathing, and provides a pavilion in
which ladies may cast the walking costume for the
swimming attire. A man has persistently loitered
around this pavilion whilst it was inhabited, and,
on being remonstrated with, explained that he
was the husband of one of the ladies, and was
there to look after her. Now, Manly wants to know
if being the husband of one of the neck-to-knee
gowned splashers gives him the freedom of the
city, so to speak ?
Samuel Lewis, who is “in the picture” of the
Government House typewriter prosecution, is an

He has a store of Government House anecdotes

copy to a writer.
The death of Sir Carmichael Anstruther, at the
age of 26, leaves Justice Darley’s youngest

When Messrs. O’Sullivan, G. H. Reid and
other victims of May’s pencil look at their

seems to be the only one who has not put up a
fagade to his figure. .
Theatrical people are interested in the
marriage of Miss Maud Thornton, the chic
Dick Whittington of last year’s pantomime,
and Mr. M‘Nicol Turner. He once figured in a
series of amateur theatricals, when his comedy
business and his dancing, mostly in conjunction
with a youngish Miss Rose Musgrove, won him
some amateur fame. Of late years his footlights’
devotion was concentrated on Miss Thornton.
The marriage took place at St. Stephen’s, Sydney,
and there was a reception at the Australia after-
wards.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ The Philharmonic Society has its own regular
and sanctimonious following, but the billing of
Ada Crossley on its ‘ Elijah ’ programme led to a
frantic rush among the smart and musical set for
spare seats. The contralto, in splendor of pale
Sold, was the angel and the casual queen. She
ad but a small share of the work—too small for
the eager multitude, and but half satisfied the
general desire to judge her deep-throated notes
m oratorio. Nevertheless she grew tired
and husky towards the end of the three hours
show, and her smile lost its crispness and she
yawned for tedium. Her ‘ Rest in the Lord ’
was a tender, passionate, devotional exhortation.
It was so great a gem that the audience clamored
for more, and she exhorted divinely once again.
V The principals of the ‘Elijah ’ service (one
waited for the collection plate at every coaling
place in the programme) conspired in a
scheme of gay dressing. One side was en-
throned the fair Ada in her pale gold,
and on the other, Madame N. M'Lelland in a sea-
blue creation with a shoal of lace drifting down-
wards. and Miss Reba Rangan—the impassive
young person with the round wondering eyes of a
fawn — in a startling shade of rose-pink. The two
sisters of Melba were in the audience, important
figures by reason of the most beautiful brocade
cloaks revelling in a riot of lace. Lady Silverlocks
Clarke sat in a subdued radiance, one innocent
white rose reclaiming the gloom of her attire.
Mrs. W. Coldham and Mrs. Maudsley were the
centre of two smart bevies—the frocking of the
former being fine.
“A Melbourne man, privileged by ripe age and
long friendship, asked a certain star, stationary
here for a period, if she were never going to think
of marriage: ‘Well,’ she said, with a look that
might have meant, ‘You old fool!’—‘do you
think I’m going to sing and stand the single
racket till I’m 60 ? No, indeed ! ’ And her
laughing eye assured him of her lurking desire to
hearken to the voice that breathed o’er Eden
before many more seasons are past.
“Federal members really should farewell little
Mrs. Fysh at a banquet ere she embarks for
Tasmania. No gallery supporter has cheered on
the Government measures to victory so stoutly as
that dame. She prides herself on understanding
all the ins and outs of political affairs, and lias sat
in judgment on every schemer in the House.
. ‘ ‘ There only appears to be one aide, the unfail-
ing Nevill, on the Tennyson staff. Society has a
hazy notion of a silent, spectacled, and most
solemn person of the name of Wingfield being also
of the suite, but it can’t say with certainty. Also,
there is a shadowy third aide—seen sometimes in
silhouette at the tail-end of the V.R. procession.
This second uncertainty is youthful, has lean
hatchet jaws, and the English Johnnie stoop.
Certainly no one will swear to him. Richard
alone seems to form the staff, and they say the
Tennysons have a real affection for it (the staff).
But the staff has been summoned to England by
its papa, the marquis.
“ Most amusing was the condescending tribute
paid by the theatrical Hr. Bevan at an Austral
Salon spree to Ada Crossley. The woolly
parson talked of Ada as being a fine lass, or some-
thing to that effect, expressed his satisfaction at
her good progress, and declared that he had
always seen its promise.
“There’s a Japanese women’s tailor doing a
round of rapid measurements in the heart of the
city. He’s a favorite and in great demand. The
tourist who makes for the land of the cherry
blossom, always returns with wonderful silk
dresses built within 24 hours by the local chiffon
constructors. The male Chinese dressmaker is
conscientious and sure, but the Jap. is more
decorative and trickier in his style. For myself I
can’t imagine a woman submitting to be measured
and tried on by the Yellow man ; but some of
them seem to like it.
“It is the male voter who, from present
appearances, is going to help plucky Vida Gold-
stein to a Senate seat. The women, with the
exception of strict devotees of the Franchise party
and the Cold Water League, scoff at the idea of a
she-campaigner, but Lie men say, ‘ By Jove, she’s
in earnest. She ought to go in ; I’ll support her ! ’
There seems a pretty fair consensus of male
opinion in her favor. And Yida may thank her
sprightly garb as. well as her sprightly wits for a
lot of it. A woman who is smart, a good
democrat and not dowdy has a lot of influences
fighting on her side.
“John Lemmone, it is circulated, exploits
Paderewski for a Commonwealth tour. How does
this strike the much-travelled R. S. Smythe?
Twelve years ago an agreement was signed by the
woolly-haired Pole to come out with Mr. Smythe.
The negotiations ended suddenly. Paderewski,
said the cables, suffered from nervous prostration;
the tour must be abandoned, ‘by medical orders.’
The Much-Travelled got some balm (you know the
sort of balm) for his feelings.
“ There is to be a Grange garden party on the
coming Friday. The Federal Huttons gave such
a show last race season, but, as it followed Cup
week, the glory was not great. This year, the
Huttons get in early—at the start of the carnival,
before the tail of the Cup costume has been
trodden on.
“Speaker Beazley busily prepares all the gaudy
trappings of his new office—wigs, gown, court-
dress, and so on. Yet Parliament dissolves in a
few months, and all the present members are
thrown on the mercy of their constituents, when
Collingwood has to say whether Mr. Beazley re-
sumes his seat and Parliament has to give him
again the Speaker’s Chair. All will hope that he
comes back to his seat, but prudence should sug-
gest postponing the visit to his dressmaker till
next year.
“It is seriously recorded that Pianist Grainger
submitted his golden crest to the scissors at
Adelaide. Manager Williamson should have
guarded against such a disaster in the contract.
“ Monday’s Mayoral dance in the Town Hall
proved a very festive finale to the Gillott reign.
Despite the temperature the show surpassed all
its predecessors. Mr. Gillott looked fairly happy
in the massive Polar bear garb and brass hang-
ings, which are supposed to give dignity to
the Mayoral office. Perhaps lie was happy
—as happy as the man who enjoyed being
kicked by a Duke. One must always allow
for a difference of tastes. The sight of the. evening
was Father Christmas Ham escorting in Lady
Tennyson. He performed the rite solemnly and
silently. There never was such an absorbed little
alderman. One wondered how so small a Ham
could oarry so much frill. The finest figure of the
dais circle was the Tasmanienne, Mrs. Elliott
Lewis—a guest, with her spouse, of the Tenny-
sons—a tall, well-formed dame in golden silk, the
hue of the Gloire de Dijon rose. The Federal
Commandant’s wife, the Dowager of Cliveden,
and a contingent of other senior frivollers basked in
pearl-white chiffons, so that debutantes could only
be distinguished by their bouquets. Prettiest. of
these was Miss York-Syme, a chubby and win-
some niece of Yes-No Reid.
“ The cynic in the balcony had material for long
thought in the sight presented by the over-
whelming majority of girls scouting for partners
at Gillott’s farewell. Never in the recollection of
the most hardened habitue of smart hops had the
numbers been so uneven or the fight so fierce.
Mothers with crops of Spring daughters searched
anxiously for the Johnnies they had entertained a
whole season. When one drifted near, fan, eyes
and lips called him. Then followed that familiar
scene of the masculine schemer who flatters,
praises and extols the lady’s graces, but retires
without inflicting himself with more than one
polka, and that with the pick of the bunch. The
paterfamilias is less skilful in manoeuvring, more
unhappy, and, oh !so much more awkward. In
desperation he hooks the arm of his old fossil
friends. ‘Come and talk to my little girl,’he
whispers, in a half-abashed fashion ; ‘she’s lost in
this crowd.’ It is a sad sight. Only the smart
girl—good-looking, chic, saucy and independent
has to reckon with a rush of partners, and she's
rare enough.
“.All that is representative of Melbourne
Society is bidden to the nuptial feast of Surgeon
Fitzgerald’s eldest daughter, Ethel, and Captain
Lumsden, next week.
“ Ada Crossley whispers to her Adelaide friends
that the excitement of this tour is destroying her
rest, her appetite, and her tranquillity of mind.
‘I get hungry, but am too excited to eat. Mr.
Williamson says I’m too emotional! ’ And Ada
begins to think that a much longer run on her
ever-girlish emotions will lead her to a premature
grave. That sprained foot has been a boon and a
blessing to Miss Crossley, Whenever she wanted
to avoid a vice-regal scramble or any extra of that
kind, the ankle ‘ was causing some misgiving,
and the apologies went in a bandage, so to speak.
As she returned for an encore number to any
platform she leaned on a chair-back, and
immediately the big, greedy audience was
overtaken with compunction.
“Since arriving in Fogtown Mrs. George
Chirnside has not been in robust health. Fellow
tourists who have come across the fair, elegant
dresser report that she has been looking pale and
worn.
“A foreign artist, new to these parts, grumbled
continually in an hotel where he sojourned a while,
and annoyed his fellow lodgers to such an extent
that the manager was appealed to. The artist
came soon after with his complaint as to the
‘impertinence’ of a waiter telling him not to
smoke in the dining hall. That a menial should
dare dictate to a man of Soul ! The manager
pacified, the soul, gave a wink of appreciation to
the waiter, and assured the bulk of his hotel
patrons that in a day the soul would be gone.
When that soul wants a Melbourne tenement
in future it will be at another hotel.
“The Charbonnet-Kellermans are certainly an
all-round lot of performers. Madame and a
fiddler son make music—the former good, soul
stirring, luminous music; and more than that,
they try to cater for the Melbourne music-lover
with choice chamber concerts. Meanwhile Pa
Kellerman is up at the Aquarium, where the
eel-like Annette scatters once again the fish of the
big tank, and takes her wet, submarine meal
while the dry-shod peer at her through the show
glass.
“Married couples should take on amateur
theatricals simultaneously, otherwise there is no
rest and no peace for the partner who is left out.
The run of recent performances proves as much.
Rehearsals take time and attention. Wifie
who turns her soul towards theatricals, and forgets
to order the evening roast or to stitch the
collar-band and the perforated sock, brews trouble
for herself. The fascination of the footlights is no
excuse for neglect of home and duty, an angered
spouse tells her. When it is the man who struts
and dallies over late rehearsals, night after night,
there come thunder-claps of temper and torrents
of tears. The woman always thinks the mumming
spouse is making violent love to some other cat.
Amateur mumming is also responsible for the
marring of many betrothal vows.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.


Where Is Your Appetite ?
Have you lost your appetite 1 Have you no relish for your meals ? Have you a bad breath ? Is
your tongue coated ? Have you a.bitter taste in your mouth? ,
Have you wretched headaches ? Have you cramping pains in your stomach, or oppression on your chest ?
Have you no energy ? Are you irritable ? Are you easily tired ? Are you pale, or languid, or down-hearted ?
If so, you need a tonic—you need Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. They don’t purge. They actually make
new blood. They stimulate stomach, liver, heart and kidneys to healthy action. They cure indigestion,
biliousness, sour stomach, heartburn, palpitation, headaches, and all other blood disorders.
They give you a perfect appetite.
“ For many years my liver bothered me,” says Mrs. E. Donoghue, Forbes-street, Woolloomooloo. “ I lived for a
good while in Queensland, and I blame that trying climate for my sickness. I began to feel lazy, and always wanted to
be lounging about. Then my head started to ache, and my back felt as though it were breaking. If you gave me all
Sydney I couldn’t bend. The pains that followed the lightest meal made me vow that I’d never touch another bit of
food. In the mornings I felt as if I had never been to bed, and it was an awful trial to get through the day’s work.
Bilious attacks took every bit of strength from me. I went to several doctors, but their medicines didn’t suit me at all.
Then a friend told me to take Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. After finishing two boxes I began to feel better. From that out
I picked up wonderfully. I took fifteen boxes altogether, but I have now such a splendid appetite, and I feel so well in
every way, that I consider the money they cost me a mere flea-bite to what 1 paid for doctors and various medicines.
There is no tonic in the world as good as a few boxes of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People.”

THE FATTH-HEALERS OF ZION.
London, Thursday Afternoon.—There have been tre-

Two remarks ascribed within the last

cussion about a garbage emporium : “In my
experience, no matter where a depot may be

enjoyment of aromatic snapshots.”
The man who came into temporary promi-

received grave consideration at the hands of the
War Office. Any patriot, nondescript, or China-
man in a jocular mood can achieve notoriety at
any time by a similar process.
Illustration of the desperate straits to which
disclosures of army muddle have driven Britain is
the fact that the best the papers can propose is
that Kitchener shall take full control, superseding
Roberts—the idol of yesterday. And Kitchener
is the supreme bungler who threw away 1300 men
so needlessly at Paardeberg. What Britain needs
is to wipe out its incompetent old nobility, which
apparently, so long as it exists, will have a lien on
the high posts of the army; but no “respect-
able ” paper dare suggest that.
John Rennie, buried at Balmain the
other day, helped Mort in the frozen-meat ex-

so on ; but the bottom fell out of some of the ex-
periments in Darling Harbor, and the business
slumped for years. Nicolle, the scientific man of

culties, and the temporary result was crash.
“H.S.R.” : Your par (B. 15/10/’O3) about

regularly every election for Carnarvon he used to
be asked if he was in favor of one man one vote
and he invariably answered “Yes.” As in-
variably he voted “No.” Still it seems impossible
to shift Foxton. At Carnarvon, when once a man
gets in, he has a sort of pocket borough until he
pegs out or resigns. Myles died whilst represent-
ing it, and so did John de Poix Tyrrell, and so
probably will Foxton.
Died, on Sunday, William Wilberforce

years Under-Secretary for Lands, and subse-
quently Secretary to the Attorney-General. He
retired on pension on the accession of the Public
Service Board. His retirement from the Lands
office was the result of a charge of neglect of duty.
It was usual to pay the clerks by cheque, each
man getting his cheque singly. On a Saturday
morning—a race day at Randwick—to save time
a cheque for the full amount (about £800) was
signed, and a junior clerk was despatched for the
cash. He did not return for some months, when
a ’tec brought him back from San Francisco.
J bn Downer, one of the picturesque
representatives-of S. Australia in the
Senate, and among the most faithful
Protectionists of them all, unex-
pectedly announces that he
will not run again. For years
past, his State has affection-
ately talked of “Old John
Downer,” until he got the
reputation of being a re-
markably well-preserved
battler of 70 or so,
whereas even now he
isn’t 60. All through,
he has been a curious
mixture ; just as S.
Australia had made
un its mind that he
was a crusted Con-
servative, he would
do some Radical
thing for in-
stance, 20 years
ago, as Attor-
ney-General in
a Conservative
Ministry, he
carried through
the Assembly a
Bill to allow per-
sons accused of crime
to give evidence on their
own behalf. Downer has the
heart of a woman and the face of a prize-
fighter. Senator Symon, by the way, preceded
him as Attorney-General in 1883 (that was the
only time Symon ever held office), and Kingston
followed him.
“N.”: The followers of the homeless
Nazarene are still persecuted. The wife of
“ Elijah ” Dowie has been robbed of a ring worth
£3OO. That is about the value of a diamond ring
stolen from a certain hairy cleric in Melbourne
years ago. Father Bleasdale, affectionately known
as Blazes, used to be a connoisseur of gems and
wines. Beecher was a most famous parson in the
collection of precious stones. He would not be
satisfied without all those mentioned in the
Apocalypse. He gave Ellen Terry a beautiful
gem.
By the death of Paddy Keane, the Rocks
(Sydney) loses a rough diamond. Paddy’s exterior
was rough, his religion rugged, and his voice
raucous, but his heart was as big as the bales of
wool he handled. He will be missed principally
by the orphanages and the poorer families of the
Rocks and the “ Point.” Many a time has Paddy
bustled into St. Joseph’s Providence Home for
stray children, looked around at the poor nippers,
and then, without any comment, thrown down a
£5O note, saying, “ Spind that fur ’em.” The late
Thomas Playfair was equally open-handed to such
people, and, like Paddy, quite unostentatious.
But Playfair’s gifts were accompanied by rose-
leaves, Paddy’s by brusqueness—often blue.
THE DEVIL AND THE DUCKS.
“ Here, Dill, Dill , Dill, Dill!"
“G.H.” : I met my 47th Henry Lawson
the other day; and have just been calculating
how many revised versions of Victor Daley,
Roderic Quinn, Albert Dorrington, Norman
Lindsay, and other noted Bohemians I have met.
I compute that I have encountered at least 20
different varieties of every Bulletin writer or
artist whose work has raised him at all out of the
ruck. I have even met “Hop” sitting on his
swag very drunk outside a very far-back shanty.
He had been looking on the beer for about a
month. I asked him how on earth he managed
to fix up his cartoons in Sydney while he was
there. He said he telegraphed them. Last I
saw of him he was making for the township to
telegraph another cartoon.

and rum vendors of that State. Some figures from
the North and Centre:

Winton, Hughenden and Croydon run to about
one pub for every 50 inhabitants, which should be
not far from a world’s record—if it wasn’t that
Herberton seems to have one pub to every ten
inhabitants. An impression is growing up, how-
ever, that Herberton has a pub too many.
FIGHT AT A COUNCIL MEETING.—AN INKPOT THROWN, &c.
Daily paper.
PORTRAIT OF AN AUSTRALIAN MAYOR
(Immediately after a Council Meeting).
From a very rare print.
“ Harri ” : In Bulletin (l/10/’O3), a con-
tributor is answered thus : “ Verse adorned with
cuckoo allusions, and the cuckoo isn’t an Aus-
tralian poetic property.” Of course, one cannot
tell the nature of the cuckoo allusions, but Aus-
tralia is plentifully supplied with cuckoos, though
the fact is not generally known. Specimens of
the European cuckoo are known, while we also
possess two bronze cuckoos, and the pallid fan-
tail variety, and black-faced cuckoo. The koel,
the channel-bill of the Northern river estuaries,
and the swamp-pheasant (so-called) also belong to
the cuckoo family. Of these, the little bronze
cuckoos, which are common about Sydney in the
spring and summer months, might be quite valu-
able as “poetic properties,” if better known.
Their shrill, wailing whistle is hopelessly pessi-
mistic, and very expressive of the more dreary
phases of Australian life. They seem to have a
fixed impression that Irvine’s £5,000,000 loan is
a failure or that Reid will be the next Premier.
The. pallid cuckoo may also be recommended to
versifiers.

A fiery discussion has been raging round
Wood’s Point (Vic.) hospital re the proposal to
engage a trained nurse, and this is how one news-
paper correspondent states his case :
It is said it is the usual thing in all hospitals. It may
be so, but the people of the district are used to the old
arrangement, though it may not be quite up to date, and
they prefer to take their chance with Mr. Senior. For
one thing, most of the miners in the district are bachelors
—some of them old bachelors. It is the bachelors who
come into the hospital, because the married men <r e t
nursed at their homes. We must consider these men—
namely, the unmarried ones—especially those who are
hard up, though I admit they should give to
th ! hospital. Novv these bachelors, as a rule, never come
into close relationship with women, living in such remote
localities, and they are naturally bashful where ladies are
concerned. If you have a trained nurse—that is, a ladv—
you w ill frighten these men from coming into the insti-
tution, because they would not like being nursed by a
female.
- From “ Vigilans :
Along the S.E. coast of Westralia, from Euclato Israelite
Bay, and on the South Australian side to Null-Arbor
station, there dwells a peculiar kind of individual, styled
Kangaroo shooter.” He does not shoot the 'roo ; on
the contrary, he employs a number of niggers and lubras,
who, in their turn, have a number of dogs, which do the
hunting. The alleged ’roo shooters’ camp is one of the
peculiar phases of Australian bush life. Two white men
mostly dwell there, but sometimes only one is to be
found. They fraternise with the blacks in a purely
brotherly manner, living, eating and drinking amongst
them. They have acquired all the idiosyncrasies of
the race ; have the same habits and same peculiar
smell. Their chief food is kangaroo, rabbit and
sodden damper (made without yeast or baking-powder),
and an occasional tin of jam or butter. The dogs,
in scores, prowl all over the place, licking pannikins,
plates, or anything placed on the ground ; hydatids are
very prevalent in consequence. The remuneration to the
mgge.r consists of “tucker” and tobacco, with an
occasional shirt, and a howling 11 bust” every quarter,
when a boat arrives at one of the little bays along the
coast. Few picanninies are to be seen, but what are
there are either brindle or yellow. Strange to relate,
most of these men are well-educated, and have held good
positions. One, at one time, was in the Indian Oivil
Service, Bands Department (S.A.), and Police (W.A.).
Another is a remittance-man from England. Another
is an ex-squatter, contractor, publican and racehorse
owner. How they get here is a mystery, and how
they live the life a greater mystery. I once put up at
one of these camps. After spending a restless night
by the fire I was awakened at daylight by the dogs, and
the first sight that met my gaze was a hideous gin
making damper in a large tin dish. A kerosene tin sim-
mered on the fire for the tea, and another gin was cutting
up kangaroo and throwing the pieces into a camp oven.
When the camp arises no one washes; each individual
simply saunters over to the fire and helps himself to what
is going. Then the day begins, the gins going out after
rabbits, and the niggers after ’roos, while the white man
and his dusky tart stay at home. Talk about beach-
combers, these men take the biscuit!

A sordid legend of the Cow Worshippers
by “Kodak”:
There was an unusual air of bustle about the little
bush church. Several carts and a few buggies stood
waiting in the sunlit churchyard, and a group of men
obviously uncomfortable in their Sunday clothes, and
wearing rather worried expressions, stood'waiting on the
steps. Occasionally, one of them would leave the others,
walk to the gate and gaze down the road. Then he would
walk slowly back and shake his head, and the rest of the
pal ty would mop their foreheads and confer anxiously
together. Suddenly arose a clatter of hoofs, and a small
boy on a big grey horse was discovered galloping up the
hill. The party of men rushed out and met him as he
pulled up his blown steed at the gate.
Where s Bill? ’ they hissed, as they gathered round.
“Can’t come!" said the boy in a harsh matter-of-fact
way.
“ Why?” yelled the men in chorus.
The flock of women that had appeared on the steps
listened intently, but could not hear the boy’s answer.
: There was a sudden swishing of silk, and a comely
angry lass in bridal array pushed her way through the’
crowd of women and hurried out to the men. “
“ Where is he ? ” she demanded.
“ Can’t come ! ” snapped the boy.
Tears of rage and mortification stood in the bride’s eyes
and there were hysterics in the air when her father
stepped forward and patted her affectionately on the
shoulder. “Can’t be helped, Maggie,” he murmured
soothingly. We 11 have to put it oif for a day or so.
Bill’s separator broke this mornin’, and he’s home'mendin’
it now.
‘B.S.” : Heavy as has been the rainfall
this winter in the Wimmera district (Vic.), so far
it has only moistened the crust of the dust drift.
When excavating recently I found that 18 inches
down the soil was perfectly dry, although water
had been lying on the surface for weeks previously.
Apparent reason—all sun-cracks tightly closed up
with last season’s dust, and until another summer
opens new cracks, a thorough soaking of the sub-
soil is impossible.
ARTISTS THREE.—AN OLD-TIME SYDNEY PORTRAIT.
(1) JULIAN ASHTON. (2) PHIL MAY. (3) ALFRED CLINT.
“A.P.R.’’ Be mad spots (B. 24/9/’O3).
At Kimberley, on the Australian North Coast,
600 miles from anywhere except Sheol, a special
brand of insanity affects the white man after two
years’ residence. It is caused by heat, loneliness
and drink. Picture N.S.W. 100 years ago, and
you have Kimberley to-day. Every three months
teams come from the coast with mails—and rum ;
and everybody is drunk for a week. Houses are
about 50 miles apart. It is the biggest thing in
the way of loneliness that Australia can show
without being so lonesome that rum is unattain-
able—all the solitude that is not incompatible with
liquor is there. In that great immensity you see
your jim-jam approaching from afar and your
fantod dancing on the rim of the horizon, and" the
voice that tells you to hang yourself on the
grass because of the scarcity of timber seems
to come from a very long way off. Then a man
loses his mental perspective and gets a curious
angular kind of insanity that is unknown else-
where.

“Matchbox” : The cocky is a cantanker-
ous, dissatisfied animal. It’s always “too-damn
something ” with him. Last year it was too damn
dry; this year it’s too flamin’ wet; the road’s too
crimson dusty, or too blanky hard, or too thun-
derin’ muddy. Isn’t it time Kyabram took a
hand at reforming Heaven? If not, there’ll be
too much jumped-up music, or light, or jasper, or
something; and I shouldn’t wonder if the few
’Pootras that drop into the other place complain
loudly of the excessive heat or sulphur.

“6x8": Australia’s shyest bird and
champion mimic—the lyre-bird—is a veritable
architect and builds the most
original and substantial nest
known among our feathered
nest-builders. He selects
two trees or stumps from
two to three feet apart,
and between them stacks
his nest. I say “stacks”
purposely, for the bottom
of the four to six feet
high structure consists of
a decent dray-load of fire-
wood. I’ve seen sticks
four inches in diameter
in a nest between two
huge old-man ferns near
Blackwarry, in the South
Gippsland _ ranges. In
stacking timber the bird
can easily hold his own
with the trickiest wood-
cutter in this land of take-
down and make-haste.
From a height of two feet
upwards the size of his building material decreases
until at the top and nest proper it becomes a soft,
hollow arrangement of fern leaves and dry grass.
The trees protect the sitting hen on two sides,
and as wind and weather changes the cock bird
closes or opens the others, only one side being left
open at a time. The hen seldom, if ever, lays
more than two eggs; one is the rule. Young
lyre-birds, even if hatched from the egg by hens,
will not live in captivity. Don’t think there is a
single tame lyre in Australia. Would have to see
it to believe it, anyway.

“ War-E. ”: About the worst type of
cadger is the tobacco cadger. He’s always on the
lookout for a pipeful, and mostly doesn’t want it!
T’other day, was accosted by one of them. Said
I hadn’t any; was going to tap him. “Oh!
right yer are, mate ; have yer pick of ’em.” And
he handed me a mustard-tin full of little pieces of
tobacco cut off the plugs of accommodating travel-
lers. Thanked him, and said I preferred my own.
A “drunk” was lumbered some time ago at
Coolamon (N.S.W.), and amongst his effects were
two coffee-tins of pieces of ’baoca—all cadged.
A plaint
by ‘ ‘ Myrtle”
from Phi Ip’s
late lamented
land :
Central
Queensland has
60ine pearls in
the way of mos-
quitoes. They
annoy people
by darkening
the carriage
window and
preventing a
view of the
Queensland
National Bank’s
scenery. They
are a larger
edition of the
bedroom skee-
ter, and usually
their imprint
makes a pro-
found impres-
sion. On Curtis
Island (C.Q.),
the timber-get-
ters all day
long have to
burn cow-dung
and grass-tree
fires round the
tree they are
felling as a
skeeter - proof
curtain. And
all day long
the horses
stand with
rump and head
alternately
backed into the
dense smoke. Camping at night the tent has to be
filled with smoke to make sleep possible— a oure worse
often than the disease. Horses, when mounted, won’t
remain two seconds in the one spot, and even though their
bones rattle from lack of condition, they fling themselves
along as if there hadn’t been a bank smash or a drought
in the country for ages. Timber-getters wear specially
made grass-seed-proof pants next the skin. Know of one
chap who, unaware of this, was forced after a mile or
two’s walk to bide by a waterhole and undress and pick
the seeds out of him. But when the mosquitoes saw a
naked elector by the waterhole they fastened on him in
billions, and he ran wildly round the hole, waving his
pants in one hand and a bush in the other, and picking
out a grass-seed at long intervals.

“ Boro-Belle,” re “Bobrid’s” remarks on
country medicoes (B. 24/9/’O3) “ The country
lawyer, too, must adopt the motto, ‘ stand
in with the local rag,’ otherwise he stands a
worse chance than the doctor. Once worked for
a lawyer in a country town that boasted three
rags, about the size of a handkerchief each. Said
lawyer fell out with the editor of the rag that was
the size of the biggest handkerchief, with the
result that it only mentioned the boss’s name in
cases he lost, thusly : ‘ Mr. Blank appeared for
defendant, and after lengthy argument, verdict
with costs was entered in favor of plaintiff.’ As
the smaller papers stole their court news from
this one, I had to write out lengthy reports of the
oases the boss won, and supply them to the two
friendly editors, otherwise the public would not
have seen us at our best. In the end the boss had
to use his influence to get the principal rag some
Government advertising to heal the breach. So
our name once more duly appeared in all our
successful cases, and our masterly eloquence
defending the drunk who had fallen asleep in the
main street was once more appreciated. ”
THE FEDERAL CAPITAL QUESTION.—
A SOLUTION.
WHERE THE LIVE MEN LIVE.
[For This Bulletin.]
Some leading poets of Australia write,
In language darker than the depth of night,
Of mulga forests and of saltbush plains
A land of sorrow where it never rains ;
A fatal country with a poisoned breath
That’s blackened with the swarming germs of death ;
A waste of sand and bones all curs’d and dry ;
A gloomsome country Where the Dead Men Lie ;
Where brown Despondency and black Despair
Flap hairy pinions on the stagnant air,
And drunken phantoms, with a fleshless tread,
Stalk o’er the skulls of the unnumbered dead ;
Where justice, virtue, manliness, and pride,
With love and honor, are all cast aside,
And life is one long struggle for a drink,
Where cows are bogged upon the mud-hole’s brink.
That land of horror of the poets’ dream—
That forms the burden of my present theme—
I’ve sought for man - long, long leagues around,
From Snowy River to King George’s Sound,
From Derwent’s waters up to Collier Bay,
By many plains and pubs. I’ve made my way,
But fail to find beneath the Austral sky
That land, bone-haunted, Where the Dead Men Lie.
In wild, dry wildernesses of the West
I’ve found real men, and found them of the best.
There strong arms wrestle and there brave hearts beat,
To win rich metal in the dust and heat,
With drill and hammer, and with dish and sieve,
Within the region Where the Live Men Live.
But wheresoe’er the anxious seeker looks,
He only finds those Dead Men’s bones in books.
WEIGHT CHASER.
THE LONG RED ROAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On the long red road he is bound due North to a shed in
the far outback.
Ere the morning sun through the mist bursts forth he
is far on his dusty track.
His head is bowed and the reins are slack, from love it is
hard to part;
And further behind, his old brown hack, leaves home and
a bush sweetheart.
And the rails are up, but a girl stands there, on the spot
where they kissed goodbye—
A curl of black in her small white hands, pressed hard to
her lips so dry.
No goodbye spoken, just a long embrace, with quivering
lips they kissed—
A strong hand-clasp, a girl’s white face, and he rode
through the morning mist.
On the long red road he is bound due South, “bound
home ” to his horse he said ;
The reins held tight in an eager mouth, then the brown
hack gets her head.
And nearer and nearer the blue hills come, behind spreads
the barren plain ;
The old brown thinks of the grass at home, the man of a
lover’s lane.
There s a cloud of dust on the long red road, quick seen,
and the rails are down ;
There’s a beating heart that has lost its load, and glee in
the eyes so brown.
No word she spoke, but she raised her eyes, love-lit, to
the face above—
And a rosy face as the rich blood flies to the kiss of a
long-missed love.

KATE, KITTY, KATHERINE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
First I met her on a station
Somewhere down the Castlereagh—
She was pretty and exceedingly sedate.
We were happy while it lasted
(We were lovers for a day)
And she shyly gave me leave to call her Kate.
The second time I met her,
After thirty months, or better,
She was barmaid in a Sydney private bar.
She was “ fly,” and bright and witty,
And the “ Johnnies” called her Kitty,
And she shouted and her liquor was “ three star.”
In a squalid right-o’-way,
Where the Harbor Push holds sway,
Once more I ran against my erstwhile queen.
Her appearance caused me pain,
Wished I’d not seen her again
When I heard a drunken Ooalie yell: “ Kath’rine ! ’

“6xB” : -Be gaol and other slang. The
noun “ screw ” has been muclily annexed by the
slanguage. As pointed out, a gaol-warder or
railway “gaffer” is known as a “screw” ; a dis-
agreeable, nagging, cantankerous old woman is ,
generally referred to as “a regular old screw.”
Both manual and brain-toilers speak of their
remuneration as their “screw.” The term
“stiff,” probably an abbreviation of certificate,
was originally only used to describe such a docu-
ment, now it means anything. A summons, a
bill, a boat ticket, a travelling-stock permib
(“stock-stiff”), a license— e.g., “Has be got
a hawker’s stiff?” Talking of abbreviation,
Australia is making rapid strides in that line.
We have’roo (kangaroo), ’mu (emu), ’pine (porcu-
pine), ’gator (alligator) ’dile (crocodile), crock (old
horse), ’hanna (iguana), ’lew (curlew), &c. So far,
animal nomenclature seems most affected, but the
thing will surely spread both to the ad- and dis-
advantage of the language. As a mate for cocky,
“ stocky ” (small stock-owner) is new to me.

“ 8.5.” : Can corroborate “ Ime Blode’s ”
statement re uncaged lunatics in N.W. Victoria,
but can t agree with him as to the cause. It
isn’t the drought; it’s the infernal barbed-wire
that’s slung on every fence, by reason of which it’s
impossible to sit or lean anywhere to collect one’s
wits. Insomnia —the want of proper afternoon
sleep on the top rail of the good old wooden fence
—makes lunatics.
TO THE NEVER NEVER.
The Irvine Government set out some 15 or 16 months
ago to give us Constitutional and Economic Reform. It
seems a pity that a Government which set out with such
lofty purposes should have so suddenly collapsed, but the
fact can be no longer concealed, and the people at large
who are disappointed should at least be undeceived.—Age.
“Cheetah ” on cooks :
Have never yet met a woman who blamed herself for a
cookery failure —have you? During my brief existence
(57 next life assurance premium) I have had three wives,
eleven daughters, seventeen housekeepers, seventy-one
domestics, and two lady-helps to help shove my gas-
tronomic canoe to the haven of the grave—not counting
neighbors’ wives who attended to the pot between the
funerals, births, and measles epidemics essential to a
well-conducted household. Out of the above 104 cooks,
of varying degrees of merit, 99 blamed the oven, two the
baking-powder, and two the wood. The only exception
to the. above that lean recall (I’ve been batching now for
five years, since my youngest daughter suddenly married
an itinerant balloonist one show time) is that of my
second last wife, who blamed either the flour or the suet
after turning out an entirely original roley-poley pud-
ding. I think she discovered afterwards that she had
left out one or other of these essential ingredients ; but,
womanlike, she blamed the recipe (or her specs.) ail the
same. Looking back over my 56 winters, I cannot help
thinking what tremendous risks the life assurance offices
take these times.

On a station near St. George (Q.), a young
couple were recently married. They were desirous
of taking the regulation trip to Sydney, but funds
were low. The bridegroom was, however, a man
of resource. He set to work and built a wheel-
barrow on the table-top principle, and on this
placed all their goods, and the newly-wedded pair
started off joyfully. They tramped 120 miles to
the border at Goondiwindi, and after a few days’
rest continued their journey to Moree, 80 miles.
They are now possibly doing the block in Sydney,
but probably not with the barrow.

winner to pull a ton 100 yards by way of proving
himself a genuine cart-horse and not a racer in
disguise, was an exciting item; and the donkey
race without whip or spur, was quite exhilarating.
In this race (which was for 155.) the last ass wins.
In the greasy-pig race (prize, the pig, with any
grease left on him) “O. Connell fell on the swine
in the prickly pear and captured him cleverly.”
The character race “caused great amusement,
Law, who was lucky enough to commandeer a
costume which consisted only of a lady’s jacket
with no buttons, was first back to the post, closely
pursued by Tom Jones, clad in a shirt.” There
were also buck-jumping, high-jumping, and
farmers’ daughters’ riding contests; hack-races,
trotting matches, and “ turn-outs and the great
gala day concluded with a trifle for the “best
batch of bread.”

“6x8”: Despite its sweet picturesque-
ness, Australian bards don’t seem to take kindly
to the sugar-cane. Every other bush, tree, flower,
herb and scrub has found a place in their songs at
some time or another. The bard amongst the
sugar-cane has yet to make himself heard. Has
the black-labor odium attached to its cultivation
knocked the poetry out of it ? [But where is the
cauliflower hard, or the pumpkin poet, or the
sweet singer who has idealised kitchen vegetables
generally? Does the poet, as a rule, take to
singing about eatables ?—Ed. B.]

Bitter sarcasm written on the wall of the
traveller’s hut on a Queensland station :
Mr. ’s rations may be taken with impunity before
or after meals.
Ifc will be interesting to note whether
shearers, and the nomads of the long roads gener-
ally, will give up their bikes for horses now that
the country is clothed in its right garb again ?
The cycle came as a matter of necessity, but the
man outback likes something with ears to hear
when he swears at it.

“ Tally ” sends a belated obituary :
Found a few years ago, in the Abercrombie Ranges,
the bones of King Billy, the last of the Lachlan tribe of
blacks. Suspected of the murder of another blackfellow,
Bobindye, he wandered into the mountains, and lived 26
years in their barren gorges. It is said he used to reckon
the years by the newly-shorn sheep. The skeleton of a
bear (his last meal) was found beside him. Teeth in the
skull were perfectly sound, the only one missing being
the one knocked out on attaining manhood. The bone
of the arm showed where it had been broken during his
wanderings, and had knit again perfectly straight.
LIGHTS O’ MELBOURNE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Lights o’ Melbourne 1 Lights o’ Melbourne I
Soul-seducing, maddening sight,
How you tempt me from my exile
To be ’neath your glare to-night !
Oh, you draw me to the pavements
Like a moth to garish light.
Lights o’ Melbourne ! Lights o’ Melbourne,
Beacons of a city’s sin,
How you make poor Duty tremble
Lest her child should yet give in,
And rush headlong to your pleasures,
Drown his soul in glare and din !
Lights o’ Melbourne, Lights o’ Melbourne,
Near your glitter, ’neath your shade,
Lives a woman, and she’s weeping—
Weeping for a renegade,
Who’s deserted Love for Duty,
And of Heaven a Hell has made.
Lights o’ Melbourne, Lights of Melbourne,
Dowse your diabolic glim,
Blinking, winking, you are wicked—
’Tis the Devil makes you dim,
For your dimness ’tis that’s tempting
With suggestion all a-swim.
Lights o’ Melbourne, Lights o’ Melbourne,
Luring to a country lout,
Leering, jeering—oh, you tempters,
Will you never more go out ?
In ray chamber dark and dreary
Still you dance and dance about.
Lights o’ Melbourne, Lights o’ Melbourne,
Ah ! your tantalising pain
Fires my senses, and a crater
Of hot passion makes my brain :
I am coming, Lights o’ Melbourne,
You have won my soul again.

THE SICK HORSE: A BUSHMAN’S RONDEL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ My horse is sick,” the stranger said,
And would not drink his beer ;
“My moke is bad —poor quadruped—
He soon will die, I fear.
“ I bought him Cobar-way, off Ted
O’Flanagan, lust year ;
My horse is sick,” the stranger said,
And would not drink his beer.
“ The best old prad mare ever bred—
He’d pull a hemisphere I
Ile'd pull and pull till he was dead,
He would ” —there fell a tear.
“ My horse is sick,” the stranger said,
And would not drink his beer.

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
So notice. (except of a hostile character) will be taken of
communications insufficiently stamped. Same and
address must appear on .1/8. So liability is under-
taken in any case re contributions voluntarily sub-
mitted, whether sent by post or handed in ; and in
no case will MS. be returned unless stamps (of any
State) accompany.
Plain Bill: Will publish “’Urry.” Send name
and address... L.H.G.: The Freetrader says Protection
produces trusts and combines (that is to say, if you stop
the importation of an article and give employment and
good wages to, perhaps, 100,000 men at making the art’o’e,
the local manufacturers, being protected against imports,
may combine to put up the price). And the Freetraders’
remedy is, not to find a way of suppressing the trust by
legislation, but to destroy the industry by free imports.
And then wo probably get the goods from the trust iri
some other country—we keep the trust and lose the
employment. Only rich countries do much in trusts ;
you can always abolish them by making the country so
poor that there is nothing worth putting in a trust. By
the way, one of the biggest combines on earth is a Free-
trade affair—the great De Beers diamond combination
J.M.L. : “Free at Last” shockingly crude J.M.
(Maoriland): “Matilda” decorated with too much cuss
language J.P. (Christchurch): Don’t begin too soon
to “pity the frog-eaters and their records.'’ Arnst has
got to put up a better record than his Warrnambool-
Melbourne one to hold his own in the best frog-devouring
company... R. 8.: There are about 60 or 70 miles of
electric tram in and around Sydney, and to enumerate
the places the trams go to would make us too tired
Iris: Scramblesome sort of verse. Kind of clawing
at the infinite Towrai : “Wasted” is good
Phil Marah : Verses very loosely thrown together.
....Q.P. : “Queen” declined H.M. : “Wind” can’t
blow in this paper A.P. : Don’t care much for
“ Tale and a Moral.” E.C. : Re “ Two Men and a Dog”
—for writing a bad hand with dim ink on grey paper
that blots, you take the cake A.W.D. : Write to Royal
Anthropological Society of Australia, Elizabeth-street,
Sydney....Wonye : Some poetic faculty, but your metre
ear fails you Barkis : Your Pegasus ambles when he
should madly career... .F.W. : Not acute or incisive
enough. It’s not a matter to be dealt with in “ holiday
and lady terms.” Hugh O’D. : Trips along merrily
enough, but doesn’t get anywhere Carl W. J. :
Rhymes all right, but metre disastrous... .Denis B. : Too
illiterate and sloppy C.M.A. : Pretty, but too slight.
.... Midget : Not bad material, but treatment too verbose
and overladen with detail.... Darius : Know nothing of
the circumstances B.F. : Mediocre and trite... .Wob-
bler : Pretentiously platitudinous Will O. : Like your
pluck ; sorry yarn not up to publication level. Give date
of the issue referred to Paul O. : Verse-form all right,
but matter poor and hackneyed Anthony B. : Neither
any good Euroa : ‘ ‘ Fate ” not remarkable enough....
S.W.L. : Don’t want any Federal capital names com-
pounded out of our “beloved sovereigns.” You know
perfectly well you don’t love said sovereigns worth a
copper ; it’s only a crawlsome figure of speech you have
got into.... J.McC. (Maoriland): “ Reservoir Claim” very
poor. . .Theophilus McKangaroo : Suggestion that the
Federal city be called “Bunyip” to hand. Prefer
“ Akenehi’s” idea “St. Wallaby.” King-o’-the-Kauri :
“ By the Waters” seems to have fallen in and been fished
out again in a very limp state A. J. Shearsby : Photo.
was sent by a man at Broken Hill. It was credited
to “A. J. Shears” owing to man’s bad writing
Torohe : Matter unsuitable.. ..P.A. (Narrandera): Vener-
able chestnuts both T.C.O’B. : The makings of a good
yarn, but too tamely told Alex. G. : Well, it's a very
bold contention. If you were to fix up your matter and
send it to the Scientific American or the Geological
Magazine (both at Charing Cross Road W., London), it
would probably be the best step Huaki : Subject has
been already dealt with F. : When a man over 70
finds himself to be a proud father it may argue
all sorts of things—most probably it argues his credulity.
In such cases you never find that the mother is 70—or
anywhere near to it. ...T.U.R. : Scrap of Genesis very
badly versed... .O. A. B. : “A Corner” t< o much like so
many other things ; too ordinary, in fact.... Vul. : There
is no possibility of a Federal Chief Justice being called on
to do Act ng-Governor’s work or other small chores of the
kind; the Constitution puts him above that sort of thing..
... .The Wayback : Not very bright, and “ dream ” won’t
rhyme with “queen” in this world, whatever it may
■do in a brighter sphere... . .G.E.: “ Strike me blind ” tale
very old lI.E. : “Immaculate” firmly declined
Callistenoon : Please don’t write again. A person who
sends such gross blunders isn’t a desirable contributor.
....Caro: Hardly enough n it Karewao : Some of
your “ Casual Philosophy ”is very ancient.... .Toby B. :
Verses inferior. Prose not quite so inferior, but inferior.
....Moses: You don’t begin to know how to write
J.V.: Will inquire about ic B.M.D. : Answered B.
■B/10/03... ..Quis: “ Raja of Johore” wouldbe more correct.
'“ Sultan,” in Malay parts, is often loosely applied to very
petty potentates indeed... .Silas F.: He was one of those
who were “ celebrated for nothing but being knocked on
:the head.”.....Dick : Yes—“ Dirty Dick.” A.W.M. :
Your hand is rather heavy for the subject
Tyro : With practice, you’ll make a workman.
....Frank O. : Elegant emptiness. Try to put
some idea-wine into your beautiful verse-bottles
He Tangata Kino : Have decided to let Maori pronuncia-
tion take care of itself. Henceforth we will think of every
Maori as Smith, and his residence as Smithville No.
183: Thanks The Geisha: We won’t “answer you
harshly.” We couldn’t, being too much stunned....
F. : “Memory” rather crude.. ..F.W. Hr (Sydney) :
As Hartley is only 70 miles from the sea, the finding of
diamond snake there doesn’t disprove the statement that
it is confined to a narrow coastal strip H.F.W.:
Huggy-huggy.i verses declined F.S.O. : Lively style,
but interest hardly strong enough.. ..Huake: Couldn't
do anything with it J. 5.0,: Too hard to decipher.
“Hop.” is'on a visit to U.S.A Solly: Fearful and
wonderful English.. ..Bessie D.: Has a thin kind of music
about it... .T. Mac.: Generally sloppy and unsatisfactory
Wee-wa: “Protectionist” in that answer was mis-
printed for “ Protestant.”.. ..P.K. : Your yarn is con-
tinually broaching-to, as it were. Avoid unnecessary
digression, and you may do good work Johnnel:
Verse bumps badly.....J.M. : Essie Jenyns left the
stage at the end of 1888 ; she was then 24, or perhaps
rather less. Never heard of her playing in “Jo” or
“ : ilver King.”.. ..Revora: Mechanically perfect, but not
a fresh idea in it a11..’. .Young Nick : Joke as aged as your
father, Old Nick Simon : Wretched poem about nude
person.... Glen : Don’t care for “Country Press.”
K.: It is a difficult matter to advise about on an ex parte
statement. Has not the Shop Assistants’ Union some
provisions in its rules as to advertising or notifying meet-
ings? If it has, and if those provisions were not com-
plied with in regard to the meeting of October 6th, then
any decision of that meeting would not be legally binding.
If you hold that the decision of September 21, and not of
October 6, represented the real views of the union in
regard to the log, why not call, by requisition, another
meeting and decide the matter definitely? A.E.B. :
“Forgotten” rather colorless.... J. : Cow poem wild in
its metre....Wanderer: Very long, and not much merit
Crocus: Declined. (No signature, but verses mostly
about the crocus) Maorimaid : Medium, and the
rushof Spring poetry is too great just now Boulder -
Not enough in it Edgar D.: Lacks interest Dorothy
Stripe: Idea good; development feeble Trident: The
fastest sailing-passage, England to Australia, was the
maiden-trip of the famous Thermopylae (1868), London
to Melbourne in 60 days ; and the highest authenticated
speed for a sailing-ship is the James Baines’s 21 knots
(about 26 miles) an hour, during part of a 24-hour run of
420 knots (485 miles), in ’64 Jas. P. : Very true, but
also very old and weary Swamper: Swamped
Racey Schlauk : “ Pale dewdrop ” poetry is a drug in the
market....M.P.: “Drought” unsuitable. Still there is
vigor about it. “ Stalks on fevered feet,” for instance, is
a good-sized expression.... Sandy : When did Greenock
become a half-Highiand town ? And though Chamberlain
spoke there he was addressing the British isles at large...
G. : Some humor in “ Footlights,” but only doggi el—
Dicken: A mad scamper after an idea—which you don’t
catch....L.U.: Wit not nimble enough for verse of that
stamp.... Syd. A.: Limping style and trite ideas
Tambo: Too psychic and transcendental. You’d do
better work if you kept nearer the earth.... W. M‘G.:
Lacks grit and grasp Brian B. : Good idea, but treat-
ment very ungainly M.A.W.: Rather pretty, but lack-
ing in reality of effect Rita S.: Verse ineffective;
story too unequal and straggling... .Exile : Tame and
wooden L.H.: Hardly enough in it.... Geo. Sydney:
Lacks spirit and vigor... .8.8. C.: Too flimsy and skittish.
....A.8.: Poem, “written on account of the disgraceful
state of the music and books in a leading suburban church
choir,” and offered to us for a guinea, firmly refused....
MAN'S STRANGE FREAK.
Penrith. —A mysterious personage, known as “ The
Hairy Man,” who, it seems, is endeavoring- to take the
character of “ the wild man from Borneo,” is having a
nice little game on the mountains just now. He occa-
sionally makes a mysterious appearance in one of the
small mountain towns, demands food, and then dis-
appears into the bush again. He visited Springwood
about a week ago, and gave the residents a great scare.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
J.C.H. : Sketch medium; joke unutterably barren.,..
Karokoro : But it’s too soon to say that Joe’s “ boat is
going over.” We don’t know what kind of boat it is
yet Jan. L. : “Serenade” will serve as suggestion....
D.B. : “Shamrock” declined C.E.J. : Drawing not
hopeless, but joke very serious indeed Robt. M. :
Shows some promise : but it is very hard to judge in
your present immature state H.W.S. : Hen and
kittens hardly in our line. We have son e hundreds of
politicians and all the native an'mals to keep an eye on,
and can’t find room for domestic pets Lily 0. : Draw-
ings show no signs ef skill at present.. ..Nimbus : Just a
series of puns —the poorest of all forms of humor
M.A.B. : Good horse-drawing, but joke shows no
sufficient reason for drawing a horse Harold S. : Only
two rather badly drawn individuals walking Percy B.:
None of the gags sufficiently unusual M‘G. : “Can-
non” joke a painfully elaborate thing....A. Scott:
Pictures worse ; jokes worst.. ..W.C S. : Five desperately
bad pictures of people with insanely short legs and
absurdly long bodies Gwydyr: A foolish old chest-
nut.. . .Kudu : Joke imperceptible. ...John S.A. : “Noah”
joke too peacefully respectable.

British Liberal newspapers suggest the
impeachment of Lord Lansdowne, the War
Minister responsible for the muddle of the
S’African campaign. Last British impeach-
ment was of Lord Melville, in 1805; an
effort to impeach Palmerston in 1848 failed.
A suggestion to impeach Victorian Premier
Irvine in 1903 also failed to be adopted.
There was no one in the Australian Parliament
who cared enough for political and constitutional
liberty to take the initiative. Yet it is the only
weapon of punishment or check available in some
cases of political misdemeanor.

Presented to the Shareholders at the Ordinary General Meeting on 28th October, 1903.
fFHE Directors have pleasure in placing before Shareholders the annexed Balance-sheet and Statement of Accounts
x for the Half-year ending 30th September, duly audited and certified.
The Net Profits (including £2094 18s. lid. brought from last half-year) amount to .. £9,538 17 11

There remains .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. £8,914 011
Which the Directors propose to deal with as follows, viz. :
To pay a Dividend at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum .. . ■ 4,500 0 0

It will be noticed that the Income Tax paid exceeds the estimate mentioned in last Report, the Commissioner
having disallowed certain deductions made in the Bank’s schedule.
The alterations in the upper portion of the Bank buildings are almost complete, and have added considerably to
the letting value of the offices. The cost of all the alterations will bring the Premises Account to about £55,000,
which the Directors consider a low sum, their opinion being strengthened and confirmed by recent sales of Collins-
street property in the vicinity.
The business of the Bank continues sound and progressive, many new accounts having been opened during the
past half-year, and the Directors, in recommending the increased dividend, which is fully justified by the figures, do
not anticipate that it will interfere with the setting aside annually of moderate amounts for transfer to the
Reserve Fund.
The Directors have again to thank Shareholders for their assistance in the past, and they trust that no
opportunity will be lost of bringing desirable business to the Bank.
By order of the board,
H. T. WILSON, Manager.

WITH
Eckersley’s Improved Aerated Water Machines
Owing to the number of unscrupulous imitators attempting to exploit a
trade which by virtue of the superiority of our machines we hold, we desire
to point out to intending purchasers:—
(1) That our machines are used solely by His Majesty’s Australian
Squadron, after an exhaustive trial, in which other so-called aerating
machines competed.
(2) That on all the Victorian Railway Refreshment Rooms, after careful
trial and examination, our machines were unanimously selected for
the excellence and purity of the aerated waters produced by them.
(3) That the leading Hotels and Clubs throughout Australasia have dis-
carded all other makes of machines and have given ours the preference.
(4) Being by far the largest importers of Pure, Natural, Liquefied Carbonic
Gas in Australia, we can insure to purchasers of our machines an
unfailing supply of this gas.
A few of the hundreds of users of our machines are given below, and
they will be pleased to furnish inquirers with their opinions thereon

POLITICAL
POINTS
T'l.S. W. People’s Reform L eague, ’tis said,
paid a man two shillings a day for distributing
circulars—a sweating crowd with a sweating
policy.
London Times gives a full report of B. R.
Wise’s recent speech on preferential trade, and
devotes a leader thereto. Sydney morning dailies
gave it space neither in their reporting nor com-
ment columns.
One serious trouble about the new political
women is that on the platform they will talk
about one another’s faces. “Her face is against
her,” said one woman lately. “Just look at her
scornful mouth,” said another.
Sydney University lias at last got all its
State endowments on a “ statutory ” footing, and
none of its votes will appear on this year’s Esti-
mates. Parliament thus loses a valuable check
on an institution which often needs sharp criticism.
N.S. W. Lands Minister Crick was reported
recently as having threatened to “boot off” the
Victoria any L. A. who denounced the purchase
of the Government yacht as extravagance. The
N.S.W. State Ministry has been even more
hilarious in its language of late.
The Coastwise Trade Bill, passed by
Maoriland House of Reps., principally provides
that ships belonging to any country which places
any restrictions upon British vessels trading on its
coasts may be subjected to retaliatory restrictions
in trading between Maoriland and any port in the
British possessions. Seddon thus wades in to
protect and look after the shipping interests of
the British Empire generally. Ho has got the
Empire-building complaint again.
A SCENE IN THE CIVIL SERVICE
EXAMINATION ROOMS.
For the Maitland scat in the House of
Representatives, vacated by Justice Barton, two
mayors are running. These may be exceptionally
brilliant mayors— Tun Bulletin doesn’t know
them personally—but it gives an uneasy feeling to
see aldermen crowding forward to fill Federal
seats.
Latest M.L. Liquor Bill proposes to apply
to prohibition districts real, genuine, name-blown-
in-the-bottle prohibition, by making it unlawful
for householders to have alcoholic liquor on their
premises. The success or otherwise of the pro-
hibition notion will be genuinely tested by that
move.
Sydney Telegraph gives many signs of
its intention of ratting on the White Australia
question—the last remnant of its old democratic
policy. On Oot. 22 it complained significantly of
the Federal Parliament “that the majority of
members were imperfectly acquainted with tropical
Australia.”
The action of the N. S. W. Labor party in
giving its support, at the Glen Innes election, to
Mr. Hay, whose only visible qualifications are
that he represents a bitterly Tory class of land-
grabbers, that he is against reduction of members,
that he is against almost every democratic idea,
and that he is in favor of the awful See-Owe’-
Sullivan policy of borrow, boom and burst, marks
the lowest depth that party has yet attained. It
is questionable if it can get much lower—unless it
tries to abolish adult suffrage.
N.S.W. Premier See said something
really smart the other day. Carruthers pressed
for time to discuss the Federal capital question.
But what can you do?” asked John of Sussex-
streat. “Pass a resolution!” replied Joey.
Bike sneezing against thunder ! ” replied he who
deals in potatoes.
N.S.W. Works Minister Owe’Suliivan
throws out a hint that he would like to go to
England and help Chamberlain’s Protectionist
campaign there. The Owe’Suliivan was very close
to coming out as the Government candidate for the
Senate, in place of Dr. Mackellar, and is evidently
looking for another berth somewhere.
Prisoners from Balmain police station are
sent to Darlinghurst Gaol, in Sydney, by tram,
and the local fsouncil appealed for a Black Maria.
The Inspector-General of Police replies that Bal-
main does not produce enough prisoners to pay
for the running of a Black Maria, so that perma-
nent and reproductive loan undertaking can’t be
forthcoming till business looks up.
For the Wentworth (N.S.W.) Federal
etaQlorate, vacated by the retirement of Mr.
M‘Millan, there are already mentioned, more or
less definitely, Mr. J. B. Dailey (in the National
Australian interest), Mr. Conroy (a brother of the
member for Werriwa in the Foreign-trade
interest), and Mr. Kelly (a brother of the gentle-
man who married Miss Knight-Mollison).
Sydney Telegraph comforts itself with
the usual remark—the one it has made at every
Victorian election ever since there was a Tele-
graph that signs of a reaction in favor of
Freetrade are becoming too obvious to be over-
looked in Victoria, and that great hopes are en-
tertained. It is so suggestive of the forlorn old
prospector pursuing his wild cat to the bitter end,
and always striking mullock.
The small retrenchment party in N.S.W.
Assembly succeeded this year in knocking off the
proposed fees to members of the Public Service
lender Board. The members are.public servants
drawing from £BOO to £l2OO a year. The idea was
to pay them £1 a sitting up to a maximum of £5O
per annum. Of course, when tlie Board had its
weekly sitting, business in half a dozen Depart-
ments would be at a standstill until the Boss came
back from earning his weekly sovereign. The
House couldn't stand the idea, so Premier See
promised that the Board would receive no fees for
work performed in ordinary office hours.
The wretchedly crowded condition of
Maorilaud lunatic asylums is mice again pointed
out by Dr. M‘Gregor with a pen
dipped in vitriol. On space
measurement they contain
276 persons in excess of
what they were built for,
and the doctor, who evi-
dently doesn’t know what
marvels of cram they do in
Victoria, reckons that no
more can be put in
unless they doss on the
ceiling. Total number of
insane is 2848, an increase
of 75 on the previous
twelve months. The in-
spector has been clamoring
for years to get idiots, im-
beciles and epileptics
treated separately and
better provided for; and
the Government once again
says (this is the fiftieth
time) that it is going to see
about it
Parliamentary select
committees are a sort of
of rage in N.S.W If a
question starts as to the
number of buttons on an
official waistcoat, some
member proposes a select
committee, with power to
examine persons, papers
and clothes. The commit-
tee has practically no power
if a witness likes to stand
out against it. The mem-
bers are sometimes taken
from all sides of the House,
when of course they don’t
agree if the question is worth
disagreeing about; or they are a
little clique of persons who were
practically of one mind before they were ap-
pointed. It is time Parliament remodelled this
bit of its machinery, or broke it up and consigned
it to the acrap heap.
Bill Lyiie says he “ will fight to a finish ”
to get th*» Australian capital fixed at Tumut in
his own ele -torate. Can’t Lyne lie induced to
shift his quarters and sit for New England ? Then
the beautiful spectacle of Bill suddenly discover-
ing that Armidale was the only possible capital
would appear in all its glory. Australia only
exists so that its capital may be in Bill’s electorate—
wherever Bill’s electorate may be.
Victoria’s House of 48 Rich Landlords
has been fooling with the Factories Bill, and that
body of ancient retrogressi ves has left very little
of it in existence. It is about time for all Victorian
democrats to realise that their only hope lies in the
Australian Parliament—in a Federal Arbitration
Bill, and in a Federal graduated land-tax and
absentee-tax that will put the fear of death into
the sordid State House of Earth-grabbers.
In Tasmania the Propsting Government,
which, so far, has seen every democratic measure
it sent up to the Council kicked into the gutter by
the gouty foot of that senile body, is now pushing
through the Assembly a Bill providing for the
reduction of the Lower House to 30 members and
the Upper House to 15, and making other reforms.
And when the Council has rolled this measure
into a hard ball and thrown it at Premier Prop-
sting’s ear, it will be about time to close the
session—unless Premier Propsting is prepared to
fight by cutting off supplies till the House of Old
Age comes to its alleged senses.
THE BOSS CUP DREAM.-HE DREAMED IT FINISHED THIS WAY.
The Queensland aristocratic National
Liberal Union fell in dreadfully lately. Said
N.L.U. invited Miss Rose Scott to visit Brisbane
and lecture to the enfranchised women. And
Miss Scott came, lectured in sturdy radical fashion
to the joy of the Queensland Laborites, and left
the dames of the N.L.U. weeping and wailing and
gnashing their teeth at their horrible blunder.
In the debates an the Federal capital site
the Freetraders of N.S.W.. argued solidly for
having the Federal site as near to Sydney and
as circumscribed as possible. The Protectionists,
on the other hand, pleaded for a Federal city with
its own port, and its own territory of at least 1000
square miles. The representatives of the Yankee,
German, Austrian, aiul^Britislr’exporters voted
solidly for the interests of the European and
American absentees, and the Protectionists worked
for the interests of Australia.
The clause in the Patents Bill providing
for the manufacture in the Commonwealth within
five years of any patented article had a stormy
time. It was inserted by the Reps., struck out
by the Senate, reinstated by the Reps., and again
rejected by the Senate. Over this matter the
Senate showed less than its usual sense and much
less than its usual patriotism. A solid combina-
tion of the Importing Party, which feared that
there was some danger of an Australian industry
arising, secured the rejection.
N.S.W. Assembly wrangled for two hours
last week before it decided, at the instance of
Labor-leader M'Gowen, to suspend the standing
orders and waste the evening in a purposeless
discussion on some abstract question about Local
Option. Then it discovered that instead of sus-
pending any standing orders that might prevent
the foolish discussion, it had voted to suspend any
standing orders that might allow of the discus-
sion, and the useless farce went to pieces amid
shrieks of laughter and contempt.
The latest individual to come back from
England with the news that our socialistic legis-
lation is having a bad effect there is a director of
the Queensland National Bank. It is a pity that
our socialistic legislation is having a bad effect. The
Q.N. Bank’s device of giving its English depositors
receipts, payable in the years of the dim remote
future, for 15s. in the £ at a reduced rate of
interest, and giving them a sort of verbal promise
of the other ss. without interest, created so
much bad effect that there isn’t much room for
more.
After 10 years of “ socialistic legislation ”
—lO years of proof that legislative “interference
with private enterprise” doesn’t necessarily knock
the bottom out of a country —Maoriland wants to
do many things which it wasn’t game to do when
Ballance was alive. Thus the introduction of
Seddon’s Trade Monopolies Prevention Bill
recalls that a similar measure, introduced early
in 1893 by one of the Auckland members, was
thrown out violently by 341617, present Ministers
Ward, Mills and McGowan being among the
majority. King Richard didn’t vote.
Iceberg Irvine acted up to his reputation
of a'“cool, calm lawyer” when he told the
Victorian Assembly, lately that, owing to the
Government's havintr to pay £47,000 more com-
mission on the recent loan conversion than it
anticipated, he would decline to grant the public
servants the increments they had been promised
and were justly entitled to. This would make up
£7OOO, and the other £40,000 would be found by
diverting that sum from the Trust funds account
to the revenue. This £7OOO is admittedly taken,
not because the public servants are overpaid and
should be cut down, but as a special class tax to
meet a certain special expenditure. Will the
Argus now say something severe about class
taxation ?
Extracts from a document largely circu-
lated by the Kyabram party at the recent Toorak
(Melbourne) election:
NUTS FOR SHOPKEEPERS TO CRACK.
The civil servants have opened co-operative stores, sup-
plying nearly everything of a profitable character you
stock.
They have largely withdrawn their support from local
business men.
Shopkeepers help to pay them fat salaries.
They jiave permanent employment.
They are doing their best to ruin you, and deprive your
children of bread.
How can you support Mr. Holmes, who champions
their cause ?
The Victorian civil servant now, in many Cases,
works 10 or 11 hours a day for £B5 a year ; he has
had his salary reduced ; he has just been told by
the shameless Kyabram Government that the
commission paid on the flotation of the last loan is
to be made up by stopping his increments ; yet
the rich Tory appeals to the meanest passions of
the cheesemonger by telling him that he helps to
pay the civil servant’s “ fat ” salary. The shop-
keeper is taxed heavily to pay for the irrigation
works that the Kyabram thieves promised to pay
for and didn’t, but that is another story.
Vic. Lands Minister Taverner, in his
search for the stray pounds that are daily being
filched from the Victorian Treasury, lately landed
on a sweet tiling long enjoyed by one of those
people whom Victoria considers so eminently fitted
to make laws that it constitutes them a House of
Parliament by themselves. This individual owns
some choice Gippsland paddocks, and alongside
them « re 16 Yniles ,of river frontage, all State-
P™i>erty. For years this honest kjdowner had
fen using property that didnt belong

“Some Protectionists,” says Sydney
Telegraph, “have suggested that Mr. Reid
should tackle Mr. Deakin at Ballarat. It has
been suggested, in return, that Mr. Deakin might

A curious tale arrived by cablegram last
week about a scheme for the re-union of Norway,
Sweden and Denmark, with the deaf and aged
Danish King as Emperor of Scandinavia, the new
empire to serve as a bulwark against Russia,
There was such an empire once; Margaret, the
widow of Hakon VI. of Norway, managed to-
drive the three kingdoms in triple harness for 37
yeans, but the show promptly went to pieces.

THE KNAVE OF ’ARTS
“Will Mr. It id explain why 10-day he says that to
remove the lascars from mail boats would be the height
of absurdity, whilst his Postmasier-General in 1895, pre-
sumably with his full concurrence, supported the ex-
clusion of the lascars from the mail boats?” —AGE.
That’s a very easy one. This is only one of
poor Mr. Reid's many political reverses.
Wriggler Reid’s diatribes against the
prohibition of black labor on subsidised mailboats
carrying Australian mails recall the fact that at
the conference of Postmasters-General of Aus-
tralia, held at Hobart in 1895, the following
resolutions were carried :
That it be a condition in any future contracts that
mailboats be manned by white labor only.
That this conference further desires to inform the
London office that no further contracts will be acceptable
to the colonies which do not include them, together
with the resolution passed by the conference relating to
the employment of colored labor.
Joe Cook, then Postmaster-General in Reid s
Ministry, signed the resolution on behalf of
N.S. W., presumably with the full knowledge and
consent of the great Wriggler. How do these two
dodgy politicians explain their present attitude T

VITADATIO
The Greatest Blood
Purifier of the Century.
A SYDNEY DOCTOR SAID IT WAS DRY PLEURISY
Exhibition House, 29 Drummond-street,
Carlton, Melbourne, Victoria.
July 15th, 1897.
To Mr. W. WEBBER, Proprietor “ Vitadatio,’’ Laun-
ceston, Tasmania.
Dear Sir, —When your agent arrived at Melbourne, and
claimed to be able to do much good with your “Vita-
datio” for all who suffer, I really thought he was an
imposter.. Previous to his arrival I had heard of
“ Vitadatip,” so I wrote to my friends (in fact, my brother
and his family) at Launcestion, Tasmania, to know if Mr.
Palmer is the authorised agent, and- received a favorable
reply. As I had been ailing for some years with pains in
mv back, which doubtless took its rise from a disordered
state of the liver and kidneys, as well as a periodical
attack of pains about the breast, and extending to the
shoulder, etc., the two latter I was told by one doctor
was “dry pleuritis” (or pleurisy), and after years of
suffering and “ treatment,” and no good results, I gave
your “ Vitadatio ” a trial, and have taken in all half a
dozen large bottles. It gives me pleasure to inform you I
am quite released from my complaint, and heartily
recommend the use of “Vitadatio" to any who may
require a reliable medicine. I have no objection to your
publishing this note.
Yours truly,
S. GRIFFITHS.

Tom Bent has had the misfortune to
furnish an extraordinary advertisement for the
bell-topper hat. Thomas, surmounted by his
impressive was standing on a step-ladder
aboard a vessel in the Victoria Dock, Melbourne,
when the ladder slipped and the heavy-weight
was precipitated a distance of seven feet to the
deck below, falling mainly on his hat. But for
that protection the burly battler would .probably
have sustained fatal injuries. Thomas was getting
along cheerfully at time of writing. There’s a
chance for the engine drivers to strike a
magnanimous little joke by presenting the ex-
Minister of Railways with a new topper, suitably
inscribed, in place of the one that went squash in
his descent.
“ The Ladies’ Magazine' says that the
great feature of Sunlight Soap is that it is
free from noxious ingredients and in no
way injures the texture or color of clothes.

The Dunlop Tyre Co.’s big motor race from
Warrnambool to Melbourne (165 miles) is down for
decision on Monday next. Some 30 odd motorists are
expected to compete, which should ensure an interesting
contest. Some judges expect six hours to be broken,
which would mean over an hour faster than the train
over the same route. The race should afford a good
opportunity of demonstrating what the motor cycle is
capable of accomplishing on Australian roads.*
Martyr to Kidney Trouble.
Me. Edmund Quinlan, 39 Oxfokd Street,
Paddington, tells what Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills did for him.
What disorder causes such mental and physical
agony as when the kidneys are diseased ? They
act as a filter for the blood, and when they are
stopped up the entire system becomes affected.
The liver—so intimately associated with the
kidneys—also fails to perform its proper duties.
No better testimony as to the great medicinal
value of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills could be
offered than that of Mr. Quinlan, who, as he says,
was a “Martyr to kidney trouble.” We use his
own words
“For many years I was a martyr to kidney
trouble; my back was so bad that my work
became a misery to me, in fact I had to give it up
for months. I was recommended to try Indian
Root Pills by a friend of mine who had derived
great benefit from them, and I must bless that
friend for drawing my notice to them. To say
that I only derived benefit from them would not
be enough, for I can faithfully and honestly say
that they effected a perfect cure. I can vouch
for this, and am very glad to be able to give this
testimonial, with the hope that others may be
cured as I was. I cannot too highly praise them,
for they are a wonderful medicine, and you may
use this testimonial in any way you please.”
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills act on the
kidneys and liver direct as no other remedy does.
They unstop the kidneys, put life in the liver,
and. a move in the bowels. For all diseases
arising from a disordered condition of these organs
and a weak stomach, Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills are an infallible cure. They cure constipa-
tion, indigestion, and biliousness so that they stay
cured. Packed in amber bottles, and sold
throughout Australasia.*

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Some of the Melbourne Cup horses that
accepted on Tuesday (when Tub Bulletin went to press)
inay be out of the question next week, but in the mean-
time the following’ are assumed to be going to the post—
Wakeful, Abundance, Sojourner, Flagship, Emir, Elders-
lie, St. Ambrose, F.J.A., Belah, Hauturier, and Lord
Cardigan. Present scribe reckons them as more dan-
gerous than Postillion, or the Idler, or any of the unrnen-
tioned lot, concerning which silence means disrespect.
As regards Wakeful, Abundance, Sojourner
and Flagship. No man knoweth whether the famous
mare (lOst.) can give 101 b. to Abundance (9.4). On two
of her recent performances, and only on those two, she
has a solid chance, but Abundance, on all of his “ form,”
including a third place in last Melbourne Cup, is better
worth backing. He is a fine, strong, game animal, more
of a battler than Wakeful, greatly improved in appear-
ance, and three years younger than the brilliant little
mare. Take Abundance to beat everything weighted at
more than Bst. Sojourner has no reasonable pretensions
to beat Abundance at a difference of only 61b. The Ade-
laide people swear by the local champion, but their
enthusiasm is not quite convincing. Granting there was
merit in Sojourner’s Adelaide Cup win, he still appears
to be harshly handicapped by comparison with Flagship,
and Flagship, although a fair stayer, seems hardly good
enough to win the hardest two-mile race of the year.
One respects Flagship—but backs something else.
* * • *
Elderslie (7.8) and St. Ambrose (7.4) are danger-
ous light-weighted veterans. Both of them failed in the
Caulfield Cup, but both were unlucky as the race was
run. Little is known of Wakefield’s stable companion
except that he won the Ooongy Handicap in taking
style and started favorite for the Caulfield Cup with 7.1
on his 5-year-old back. The son of Wallace should have
stamina, but in the Melbourne Cup he will carry 71b.
more than his Caulfield weight, whereas St. Ambrose
gets 71b. less than before. The English-bred horse
is not likely'’ to be backed by the public unless
he shapes well in the Melbourne Stakes on Satur-
day, nevertheless he has a good outside chance. He
is a son of St. Simon, and the direct offspring of that
vile tempered sire are sturdy as a rule, although their
stock shows more speed than stamina. Postillion, Lord
Cardigan, St Moden and others are grandsons of St.
Simon, but the hot-headed St. Ambrose is a St. Simon
pure. Some good judges of points in a thoroughbred
don’t like this fellow from England a little bit, but up
to now the imported nags (ltussley, Mostyn and Sir
Foote for instance) have shown speed in every instance,
and one of them—Voyou—narrowly escaped a Melbourne
Cup victory. St. Ambrose has * seemingly improved
much since he became acclimatised, and, all going well,
he should shake his tail at many of them next Tuesday.
* * * *
Of the 3-year-olds—Emir, F.J.A., Hauturier
(all in Scobie’s stable), Belah, and Lord Cardigan—this
scribe has least reverence for the last named, although
the colt beat Wakeful and Postillion in the ltandwick
Plate (2J miles) last month. It was a slow-run race on
heavy ground, and the mare was off color at the time. In
the Metropolitan, where the pace was fast, Lord Cardigan
ran nowhere. Emir, all going well, should win the Derby,
and if he perforins handsomely in the classic event, the
fine colt must be fancied for the Cup, even with 7.13
against his name. Perhaps he is not quite fit, but Car-
nage was not fit when he ran second to Tareoola years
ago, and Emir is a greater Carnage. F.J.A. (7.3) is said
to be fully equal to Sweet Nell, and he may be equal to
giving 51b. to dandy Hauturier (6.12), the alleged Cup
horse of Scobie’s lot. One or other of them is pretty
certain to be first, second, or third in the two-mile race.
The writer believes in Emir, and expects him to nearly
win the double. Take Emir, Abundance, St. Ambrose
F.J.A., Hauturier, and Wakeful as the most likely ones.
Abundance is the safest “place” investment, anyhow.
They can’t all win. The most tempting straight-out in-
vestment at the present market price is
St. Ambrose.
» * * *
Last year the Moonee Valley Cup was won by
The Persian from Patronus and Avalon. This year
Avalon and Patronus, each weighted at about a stone
heavier than before, ran second and third to T.M.S.,
another of Fielder’s. But T.M.S. is not likely to start a
hot favorite for Melbourne Cup, as The Persian did.
Now stated by her trainer and other people
who had the filly under close observation that Sweet
Nell was unlucky to lose the Metropolitan race at Rand-
wick last month. She not only lost it—she was beaten by
five horses on that occasion. Here, then, is the point for
punters to catch hold of and hang on to. A good, honest
gee-gee can win a mile-and-a-half handicap, with 20 odd
goers in the field, if assisted by good luck, whereas bad
luck will peg the same animal back to sixth place at the
finish.
♦ * * *
The sweet story of Nellie Stewart having won
£lO,OOO by Sweet Nell’s victory at Caulfield is cruelly
contradicted by another story to the effect that George
Musgrove, in W.A., despatched a telegram to Rupert
Clarke, in Melbourne, asking him to put £7O on Sweet
Nell —£50 for G.M. and £2O for the filly’s godmommer,
presumably. The message was handed in at 11 a.m. by
the sender, and it reached Rupert’s address (Menzies’
Hotel) at 8 p.m., four hours after the race.
* * » *
Of interest to the unsophisticated punter: A
Vic. Ikey (with a name beginning with an “ O’”) laid a
backer 40s. to 10s. about Idler in the Stand Handicap at
Flemington. But when Idler duly came in and the
punter called round for the cash, the O’Levi informed
him that he could only give him his 10s. back as he
(Phelim O’Moses) had been “hard hit.” A Criminal
Court case resulted, but the jury, without leaving the
box, found Patrick Abrahams not guilty. Evidently it is
advisable to see that your O’Moses isn’t of the sort who
closes for indefinite reconstruction when he is “ hard
hit” with a forty-shilling bet.
* * * *
Remarkable that figures (29745) of Caulfield
Cup winning group added together totalled 27; those
(66960) which drew second horse give the same result;
while Sydney Eight-Hour Art Union first-prize number
(142884) also tots up 27.
♦ * * *
Estimated that Scobie stable connections took
£20,000 out of the bags of Ikey Moses over Caulfield Cup ;
and this, atop of what they closed on through Debutante
Stakes, Caulfield Guineas and Toorak Handicap, makes
up a pretty substantial haul. Said that one heavy bettor
speculated £5OOO on Caulfield Cup, backing every nag in
it, and came out well ahead. Sweet Nell was one of his
particular fancies.
• * * *
Lucky Ballarat trainer Scobie, who threatens
to get away with even more of this season’s Victorian
racing plums, was, about 20 years ago, first jock in Howie’s
Ballarat stable, and appropriated G. N. Hurdles on
Rhesus. He trained and piloted G. N. ’Chase winner
Ruby in 1888. Afterwards (up on Blue Mountain each
time) Scobie won the two Hurdles at Melbourne Cup
meeting. Subsequently and up to the time (8 years ago)
.Faui Pry won for him, Scobie trained with indifferent
success, but since then things have gone very much his
way, particularly in Clean Sweep’s year.
* » * *
In its 24 years’ history Caulfield Cup has only
been won by mares three times : Blink Bonny, abso-
lutely unbacked, and a big “skinner” for the Moses,
scored in 1884, and, a year later, rank outsider Grace
Darling beat the biggest field (41) race has ever known,
getting through a terrible smash which saw 17 nags
sprawhng, and finest little jock of his time, Donald
Nicholson, killed. Trainer F. M‘Grath of present Melb.
Cup favorite Abundance, was on Lord Exeter then, and
came down in the crash, and only missed death by a
hair s-breadth after a protracted illness. Sweet Nell was
the third of her sex to succeed.
* * * *
The latest turf trick was worked thus:
Pearlstein, the bookmaker, lives, when he is at home,
in a certain town and knows everybody. Also he knows
who everybody’s particular friend is. He recently
attended a race-meeting at a place twenty miles away,
and noted everybody of any account there from his own
town. Then his accomplice D.'amondstein sent a tele-
gram purporting to be from each of these people to each
person’s particular friend at home, telling the friend that
Deadhorse was such a sure thing for the Defunct Han-
dicap that he mustn’t miss it. And Pearlstein’s
partner, Topazstein, was at home in his office and
ready to be rushed by all these people hurrying to back
Deadhorse for the Defunct Handicap. That is how it is
supposed the thing was worked ; but Diamondstein has
completely vanished, and even if he hadn’t done so the
telegraph clerk has only a faint recollection of the nose
of the person who sent many telegrams ; and Pearlstein
was pursuing his avocation in his usual honest way on
the course ; and Topazstein did nothing except take the
money, and as he always took everything he could get,
except pork, that couldn’t be called a suspicious circum-
stance. So beyond the fact that the telegrams were
bogus, and that Deadhorse was so lame he didn’t get
halfway' round the course, nothing is very certain.
* * * *
“ B.” : The turf news columns of the Sydney
dailies have been tiring me of late. “ The day’s racing,’*
they' would, say, writing, perhaps, of a Warwick Farm
meeting, “ was of interest mainly because of the light
thrown on the bigger events of Randwick and Fleming-
tjn.” By the light thus thrown they sized up the
chances for the Epsom. Most of the writers were all out
of it, but the running of that race threw another flood of
light on the Metropolitan. A33to 1 chance reversed all
the Epsom running, but the writers above consoled them-
selves with gathering a loud glare of illumination on the
subsequent campaigns (y'our real sporting writer is fond
of “campaign ”) in Melbourne. They fell in on the Caul-
field meeting, but “viewed in the light of the Caulfield
running,” &e., &c. As I said, Pm tired of it. All this
glare of light hurts my eyes, and I’ve had to buy green
spectacles.

“G.” writes: It now appears to be practically
certain that Wakeful will saddle up for the Melbourne
Cup. Her lOst weight, with sex allowance, is equal to
that which Carbine carried home in iront 13 years ago in
a record field (39), in record time (3min. 28Jsec.) Com-
paring their capabilities Wakeful’s record reads

Carbine ran 43 times, scored 33 wins, was second six

but Wakeful has performed with wonderful consistency.
Still, with prolific rains, and conditions generally favor-
able, everything points to a year of Abundance.

Kensington (Sydney) Pony Club had a special
day Wednesday last week, and invited the Governor and
Darling Point and “ sassiety ” fore-fronters generally. Big
fields were the rule; 80 nags stripped for six races.
Victorian jock, C. Russell, annexed four of the events,
thus creating probably a record for Kensington. Pony
Noses all suffered a bad gruelling, and ’tis said some of
them had to ask for “time.” Two big “shop” bettors
combined, and opening up with £25 (at sixes) on Olga
Patricia in the first race, landed £3OOO as a result of the
day’s operations. One “ book ” dropped £7OO. Extra
inducement to “ try ” was the fact that added money (for
that occasion only) totalled £250.

“Yarrum” : At an up-country (N.S.W.) race-
meeting a blackfellow was clerk of the course, and dogs
had a bad time with a 14ft. stockwhip. Just before the
“big race” the clerk was advising a friend to back a
particular horse, and the friend asked, “ You back him,
Billy?” Billy looked indignant. “Me back him! How
the can I back anything, and me holding this posi-
tion I Me one of the officials, dash yer ! ”

Judged by fact that twenties are the best avail-
able about Mars for M.L. Cup, it looks as if he has sup-
porters in some quarters. ’Twill be remarkable if Mars
scores ; he was foaled verging on 14 years ago, and is the
oldest nag entered.
* * * *
Performances of Quarryman in M.L., recently,
have been more than ordinarily good ; he got away with
a two-year-old event at Hawkes Bay, and followed up by
winning King Edward Handicap. (150sovs.) and Guineas
(300sovs.) squelching more fancied stable chum, Treadmill,
in latter race. Quarryman (then a foal at foot) was, with
his dam Madowia, bought by Geo. Clifford at St. Albans’
stud break-up for 425g5.

Accidents were plentiful and severe at Port
Adelaide race meet, Saturday. Four of nine starters in
the ’chase sprawled, but only serious injury was sustained
by Smith (rider of Mulcra). In concluding race (Welter
Handicap) A. S. W illis’ mount (The Bird) fell and brought
Bombala down. Jockey (Anderson)up on last-mentioned
nag, suffered little hurt, but Willis died Sunday
morning. Willis was the Grain State’s crack horseman.
Dead lad did all Mr. Howie’s riding for some time past
and among other plums, landed a Goodwood Handicap
for him. Staced that, through Willis’ death, Mr. Howie’s
horses—Fairyland and Trochon—were to have been
scratched from Tuesday’s (this week) Maribyrnong races,
and more than likely neither will shape at coming V.R O
meeting. °

Apropos the three nags that tied twice at Moore-
field last Saturday week. Tiie Bulletin can find no parallel
to this, though a few instances of three running a dead
heat are recorded, notably Lady Roodee, Mitchell, and
Glentworth (at Randwick 15 years since); Some Day,
Charming and Lonely (at Rosehill a year later) : and
Syerla, El Norte and Fortalice in 1897.

There has always been an annual howl about
Lancaster Park, Christchurch (M.L.), being used for a
bike meeting on Good Fridays, but the directors took no
notice of the yelp until t’other day, when the chairman
arrived provided with a sack of information as to how the
religious ranters had employed their Good Fridays for
years past. He said the shareholders couldn’t grasp the
subtle distinction between private and public “desecra-
tion ”of the day. He pointed out, in a pained voice
that opponents of bike racing went boating and girl-
picnicking and canoodling on G.F., and yet, had the
audacity to w'ail against those who enjoyed themselves
respectably,, openly and unashamed. Thereupon the
meeting decided that the Park should still be available
on X-bun day, and the kiss-in-the-ring crowd retired
blushing.

The newspaper wrangle between the N.S W’
Cricket Association and the Trustees of the Cricket
Ground still goes on. The Association got in a "nod shot
recently when it asked the Trustees why, if the ground
is in need of money, they (the Trustees) gave £lOOO to tiie
drought fund last year, and also why the gTound was
given practically for nothing to the Victorian footballers
in order to provide amusement for their 3000 dead-
head members. Phil Sheridan, who holds up the
Trustees’ end, ignored the first thrust, but parried the
second with a back-handed retort, that at the last
Maclaren Eleven match over 2000 complimentary grand
stand passes, issued by the Association, were collected at
the gates. All of which gets the main dispute no
forrarder.

Charlie Turner, a back number as far as first-
class cricket is concerned, now plays for a nondescript
team called the Ramblers. The “Terror” has not lost
all his cunning, though. Playing in a competition match
one recent Saturday the Ramblers dismissed their
opponents for 15 runs and Charlie’s bowling average was
6 for 4.

Melbourne Carlton Cricket Club’s perpetuation
of punishment inflicted on top-grade cricketer J. Worrall
for his ill-advised communication to English umpire J.
Phillips anent Saunders is soundly condemned by the
great bulk of true sporting men. Carlton club’s instruc-
tion to its selection committee to omit Worrall from all
club teams is the essence of pettiness, and finds very
little applause outside the section of the club responsible.
Worrall has helped much towards making Australian
cricket history, and is able to assist still further,
and the fact that very many prominent cricketers and
cricket followers have expressed themselves strongly
against the C.C.O.’s action, is evidence that they do not
size Worrall’s offence up as sufficiently heinous to justify
flattening him out for life,

Clem Hill haa already got going in electorate
cricket with 156 not out. He has also kept himself in
form by winning a steeplechase and running second in a
flat race (all scratch, but open to stockbrokers only);
also, by winning a big club billiard handicap during the
winter and coming second in another. Hill, who also
won a doubles handicap at an open tennis, tournament
two or three years back, plays every game except cricket
m a cheerful and humorous spirit, which leads handi-
cappers to regard him as a person who need not be taken
seriously, whereas he is in reality a very fine all-round
performer.

N.S.W. Cricket Association intends to allow
the visiting English cricket team to choose any recognised
umpire in Australia for the N.S.W. fixture, the Associa-
tion _to _ choose the other one—always provided that
Phillips is left out. The umpires have been the wrangling
point during, the visits of the last couple of English
teams, and it is to be hoped that a proper understanding
will be arrived at.

Promised prize to Sydney junior bowlers who do
the hat-trick, present season, has them all at high ten-
sion. Up to moment of writing, seven are known to have
qualified, for the gift, but there are more of whom official
notification has yet to be made. One accomplished the
feat twice.

Sydney Senior grade cricket entered upon a
new round Saturday. Conditions favored bowlers.
Most notable thing of the afternoon was Farquhar’s
notching 108 and going right through an innings wherein
the whole side (Central Cumberland) opposed to
Leichhardt-Balmain only accumulated 150. Next best
score to Farquhar’s was 10.

The monotonous club-swinging nuisance is about
to be staged again. T. B. Bax, who let himself go for 40
hours, at Newcastle, in ’97, has just heard that somebody
has smashed his record in S’Africa, and he intends erect-
ing a fresh sign-post, at Napier (M.L.), in November. A
go-as-you-please club swing, paid for by the day, is about
as interesting as watching a bee walking down a fire-
escape.

“Thurla”: Wrestling is a branch of sport that
very readily lends itself to fake exhibitions of skill.
Remember a travelling acrobatic troupe that came to a
north-western N.S.W. town. Its greatest draw was “ Big
George,” the wrestler. After the preliminary “ hi-hi-hi ”
and great drum-banging outside the tent the proprietor
threw out a challenge to all-comers for best two out of
three falls with George, either Grseco-Roman, Cumber-
land, or catch-as-catch-can styles, for £2 a side. Although
they produce many pugs in the north-west, wrestlers are
scarce. But this night a roughly-dressed man shoved
through the crowd and accepted the challenge for catch-
as-catch-can style amidst great enthusiasm. After the
usual acrobatic business the two wrestlers came to their
work, the pro. in circus tights and the other in working
pants. First fall, after some hard struggling, went to the
pro. Second to the stranger after a desperate struggle.
By this time great excitement had hold of the crowd
George won the last fall, but it took him half-an-hour of
violently tearing and rending to do it. The proprietor
came forward and congratulated the stranger on his skill
asked his name, &c. Stranger said he was hard up’
making for Newcastle in search of work. The hat was
taken around to help him, and about £3 was forth-
coming. Next day I issued the railway tickets for the
departing company. It was the casual wrestler who
paid the fares. Apparently he was the oo.’s treasurer

A bowls record that will take a lot of approach-
ing. On Melbourne 0.0. bowling green, in a rink match
recently, Rev. Alex. Brown drew the shot 20 consecutive
times, and, while never more than 6in. or a foot away
from the jack, was often right on it. There were always
four or five bowls round the white sphere when Mr
Brown rolled his first bowl up.

The final of the Western Suburbs (Sydney)
Rugby Football Association, produced the greatest
tussle seen for a long time. Three attempts were made
to provide the ultimate premiers, and on each occasion
although extra time was played, the matches ended in a
draw. After thus wrangling for three weeks, the
Metropolitan Union stepped in and gave equal honors
and trophies to each club.

Big thing of N.S.W. National Rifle Association
meet, concluded in Sydney on Saturday, was “ Common-
wealth match,” decided last day and wherein six Stal es
competed. Result was in doubt till finish ; consistently
good shooting (in other events) of Queenslanders made
outlook rosy for them. Match lasted from early morning
till late in the afternoon. Conditions were 10 shots each
at 300, 600, 700, and 900 yards. First range operations
saw Victoria lead S.A. by 1 point, but ’twas t’other wav
about after the 600yds. shoot. S.A. team were 4 to the
good through 700yds. results, with Victoria second ; but
the next and last (900yds.) proved disastrous to’ the
Wheat Staters, who fell off badly. Victoria gathered the
match with a surplus of 13—1500 to S.A.’s 1487. Q reps
(third) accumulated 1480 and shaped well, but never bril-
liantly ; ditto N.S.W., whose compilation was 1458
Highest individual score was Lt. W. O. Addison’s (S A )
174 of possible 200. W. G. Willoughby (Vic.) filled second
place with 164, and Q.M.S. Meaney (N.S.W.) third— l6o
Last year competition was contested in Adelaide, when
same two sides (Vic. and S.A.) were first and second with
1553 and 1519.

Champion English amateur ped. Alf. Shrubb
scattered more records last month, covering 2 miles in
9m. 17s. Previous best grass track performance was
W. G. George’s 9.36 3-5, accomplished 19 years ago and
prior best (9.170 on a cinderpath also belonged to George
Professional figures (9.110 are, however, still good • they
were established at Manchester by W. Lang, and have
remained intact 40 years. Shrubb covered the last quarter
in 66 1-5. His time for 2000 yards was 5.10 4-5 Um fi
4-5, and for l|m. 8.10 4-5.

Ex-world’s champion billiardist Stevenson’s
M.L. tour was mulled ; but for Sydney Tatts. tournament
winner, Bill Lyons, and J. R. Hooper coinin''" to the
rescue, Stevenson would hardly have been %een in
Auckland. ' isitor gave Hooper half the points iii 1000
and won by only 21—his best effort was 156. Concedin'’
550 in the thousand to Lyons, Stevenson was alongside his
man at 920 and, going on, won by 80, making two solid
runs—l4l and 142. Later Lyons got 600 start, but the
Englishman totted up 204, then 121, 119, S 6 and 76, and
eventually went out 176 to the good in lh. 40m., aver-
aging just 40 points for each cue. Stevenson is now
aboard the Aorangi going Vancouverwards.

Some rowing scraps. Latest winner (W. G.
Slack) of Queensland amateur sculling supremacy is
brother to ex-champion of same name, beaten twice by
N.S.W. top-notcher J. Daley. Slack is lOJst. Holder
(Percy Ivens) managed to gather Victorian amateur scul-
ling laurels once more. Ivens rows a good oar, too, and
has been more than once chosen as bow in the State eight.
Likely that he will set Tasmanian champion Bourke a
difficult task when the time comes round, for, just now,
it looks as if Australian top-notchership will rest between
that pair. Cornstalk premier Daley’s retirement is defi
nitely announced.

The average Irish-blooded Australian doesn’t
appear to know much about the language of his ances-
tors. The name of Foy’s mare, Ban Ceontha, was all
the same as Greek or Hebrew to hundreds of professed
“ Micks" who read it in the newspapers. Questioned on
the subject, they couldn’t give the correct pronuncia-
tion of the name or state its meaning. As a rule, the
puzzled grandsons of Erin didn’t even guess that'it was
an Irish name. Ban Ceontha, by His Reverence—Gift of
the Gab, signifies—-well, what does it signify ?

Monty Andrews cut even with Australian
champion light-weight Bob Turner, in Sydney, the other
day—not due to Andrews having come on, but to the fact
that Turner had gone off, though still little more than 20.
There was an almost complete absence of his onetime
dash during the whole 20 rounds, and that he lasted so
long, and finished fairly strong, was due more to bull-
dog grit than aught else. What pugs generally thought
of it was evidenced by the bunch of challenges Turner
subsequently received, and the joy of Truscott at securing
a match for four weeks hence. Turner will have to train
now, and be at his best, too, or the title so long held will
slip from him, for Truscott owns all the essentials towards
world’s premiership form, bar first-class science—and,
with his own peculiar methods, he’ll take a heap of
beating.

To take part in the Warrnambool to Melbourne
road race (165 miles) a selector named M’Gillivray hiked
it from about 40 miles below Wilcannia, on the Darling

600 miles to ride to get to the starting-point of the race.

S.A. League of Wheelmen’s big meet ended
Saturday. Racing generally was high-class. Local top-
notcher, Wilksch, shaped brilliantly throughout and
appropriated five miles supremacy of Australia, but only
by a couple of inches from Pye, and this pair got away
with all the big prizes, bar one. Last time a South Aus-
tralian annexed the five miles’ championship was seven
years ago, when.R. Russaek succeeded. Fast times were
out of the question through strong gusts sweeping across
the ground.

Dunlop road-race (at Homebush, Saturday)
over a 20-mile course, for N.S.W. championship, attracted
24 starters, but expected hot tussle didn’t occur, for
North Sydney crack (Biden) went away with the lead and
stayed there throughout, winning easily in 55.43 1-5.
Next man, Toose (Redfern), was nearly 2min. behind.
Bideri’s performance beats all previous records, spite of
road being muddy and the fact that distance is now
stated to be 22 miles.

Latest mail tells that Robl (recently in Aus-
tralia) met Dangla (world’s hour record holder) and
Dickentmann (100 kilometres world’s champion), at Berlin,
in a two hours’ scorch, behind pace, and won easily',
setting up new world’s figures— 86m. 252yds.
*’ ' * * *
Taking as a guide the track-form and American
performances of crack visiting cyclists Lawson, McFarland
and Downing, Australian wheelmen have a tough job
during the coming cycling season. The Yankees have
come with the avowed intention of scooping the plums—
with a special eye on Sydney Thousand ; and as each rider
has the reputation of being a deal better in handicap-
riding than last year’s imported Major Taylor, the big
handicaps have more than an average chance of falling
to the lot of the Yankee fliers.

This is the “reduction of members”
policy of Mr. Thomas, the Carruthers candidate
for Glen Innes:—
Despite the numerous reports to the contrary, he was
much in favor of such a course being’ adopted, and that
soon, although he did not think it a probable or likely
event. He would prefer to have the question of local
government settled first, after which the reduction of
members would follow as a natural corollary. He did
not approve of the reduction of members on a population
basis, as he considered that such a proceeding would give
the city, with its large population, an unfair advantage
over the country electorates.
In other words, Mr. Thomas favors reduction, but
not at present, and not under any possible con-
ditions. Truly, as he said a while ago, Joey
Carruthers does not “ make a fetish ” of reduction
of members. Reduction was to be a natural
corollary of Federation. Now it is to be a natural
corollary of Local Government. Later on it will
naturally crawl after something else.
Few men have a better knowledge of the
working of the Lands Acts than has Land Agent
W. N. Willis, of 21 Bligh-street. Payment by
results is not only reasonable but also novel.*
The methods of the Victorian Deformed
crowd begin to smell something extra in view of
the approaching State elections. The Govern-
ment now grants special cheap railway fares to
Kyabrainmers and their wives when going to or
returning from political gatherings of the right
kind. The special cheap ticket can be secured
in various ways; one of them is by produc-
tion of a voucher “ countersigned by Mr. G. W.
Dean,” the Kyabram league’s hired agitator
—it is specially intimated in a printed docu-
ment issued with the signature of Traffic-
manager Lochhead that the signature of Agitator
Dean is a sufficient guarantee— to prove that the
applicant is a good Kyabrammer out on Kyabram
business. This idea of granting special cheap
fares to Government supporters—especi ally when
the supporters belong to the party which is so
anxious that the railways should be made to pay—
has some interesting features about it.
Died at Sydney, William Steele Wisdom,
Sydney native, aged 67, brother of Robert Wis-
dom, Q.C., who was Attorney-General in the
Parkes Ministry of 1879. Robert Wisdom
belonged to the days when there was no payment
of members, or Labor party, or socialistic legisla-
tion, and when a howling, cursing Legislature of
gentlemen ran a cheery bear-garden in Macquarie-
street. Almost the last time that Robert Wisdom
was “removed” the table nearly came along with
him, so strongly did he hang on to it, and if it had
come the blessed Mace would have trickled on to
the floor.
Now that the Melb. racing season is in
full blast, to pick the winner is the dearest—if not
the most expensive—wish of every right-thinking
citizen. The best oracle to consult on this, or any
other, subject is D.C.L. Whisky. It doesn’t
make one “see things” in the d.t. sense of the
term, but it stimulates the prophetic instinct.
D.C.L. the Whisky of the Wise. The Brand for

What a miserably parochial little soul the
S.M. Herald has nowadays ! The Federal High
Court, for convenience sake, was sworn in at
Melbourne ; then came over to Sydney and began
serious business. Whereupon the small-minded
Herald :—
It was not the first time the Court sat in the Common-
wealth. That was a matter in the decision of which this
State had no apparent voice, and in any case the scope and
function of the High Court are of too important a nature
to this Commonwealth and its citizens to make that a
question of the slightest moment, however interesting it
may be as an indication in other directions.
If it wasn’t “a question of the'slightest moment,”
what did the Herald want to drag it in for?
New South Wales has secured two out of the three
High Court Judgeships, and the third has gone
to a Queensland man, educated in N.S.W. No
Victorian had a look in, and no State had any
voice, or had any claim to a voice, in the purely
Federal matter of the High Court. But the
“Victorian conspiracy” idea remains as fresh
as ever in the Herald’s diseased imagination.

TERHS OF PAYMENT UP TO TEN YEARS.
HAMILTON GROOM & CO., of 116 Queen Street, Melbourne, and J. B. McDOUGALL, of
Casino, have received instructions from the owners to sell by public auction at the
SCHOOL OF ARTS, CASINO, on THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 26th, at one o’clock,
The First Sub-Division of the Kyogle Estate containing 2?,000 Acres,
sub-divided into Farms from 50 to 400 acres.
The Kyogle Estate contains 41,000 acres, of which about 12,000 acres are the finest river flats in Australia—deep
black and dark chocolate loam. The balance is rich dark chocolate ridges, free from grit—the true chocolate soil so
highly prised by farmers, soft, mellow, and greasy to the touch, retentive of moisture, and overlying a basaltic
formation.
The first sub-division is now being offered to the public, containing
20,000 ACRES,
of which 7000 to 8000 are river flats—the balance rich dark chocolate ridges, all lightly timbered, and open grass
country—no heavy timber to clear —no scrub to be cut down and burned off.
Dairying can be commenced on this land at once with no further outlay than for fencing and necessary buildings,
and the carrying capacity can be gradually trebled by working in paspalum and other grasses.
For many years the Richmond River districts were practically unknown, and the dairying industry there is
comparatively of only recent growth, but has taken such gigantic strides that the output of butter, bacon, etc., now
exceeds that of any similar district in New South Wales, and there is a population now settled there of nearly 50,000
persons, which is rapidly increasing. In no part of Australia is there a district better suited for carrying an
enormous population on small holdings—the excellence of; the rainfall, mild climate, and fertility of the soil all com-
tbine to make this the Garden of Australia. The Government of New South Wales has recently surveyed a line of
from Casino through the Kyogle Estate, and with the sub-division of the property there is every probability
tthat the line will be constructed at no great distant date. A Township has recently been formed at Kyogle, 18 miles
from Casino, to which there is a metal road ; and there are already several stores, an Hotel, a blacksmith’s shop, two
churches, Creamery, a saw-mill in full swing, a State School close by, a Post and Telegraph Office, and more buildings
in course of erection, while the Bank of New South Wales has recently opened a branch there
Never before has such an opportunity occurred to secure some of the finest land in Australia at such low figures.
Owing to the demand that has existed for dairying and farming lands in favored districts properties have been
forced up to extreme values, and the purchasing power of the would-be settler much restricted. He has now the
opportunity of securing land at least equal, if not superior, to that in any other part of Australia at one-fourth the
price paid in some districts ; and he will have the advantage of good roads, excellent market facilities, and a climate
that will enable him to dairy successfully all the year round, and where he will have the satisfaction of Seeing his pro-
perty steadily improve in value for many years to come. , ,
Most liberal terms of payment will be given—viz., one-fougth cash, one-fourth m two years, balance up to ten
years at 5 per cent., or all cash at any time if desired.
TITLES FREEHOLD UNDER TORRENS ACT.
SPECIAL NOTICE.
Exceptionally Low Reserves will be fixed for this First Subdlvlslonal Sale, as the owners
intend to offer every inducement for settlement on the Estate.

The small society that hangs on the skirts of
the life assurance business and collects the fortnightly
fourpence or so at the working-man’s cottage door has to
play fantastic tricks these times ; evidently the working-
man is beginning to wake up to the fact that he gets
about a penn’orth of insurance, the other 3d. being
required to pay for shoe-leather, and he doesn’t therefore
“ part ”as he used to. Agents consequently have to be
encouraged; and that’s where the fantastic tricks come
in. The Temperance and General, for instance, prepares
for Christmas by issuing this notice : Each agent col-
lecting not less than 96 per cent, on his book and com-
pleting six ordinary cases (amounts less than £55 will not
count), will receive, prior to Christmas Day, a Splendid
Bronze-wing Turkey. A special prize, in addition to a
turkey” (the seasoning, probably), “will be given to
each of the three superintendents who have the
largest number of prize-takers on their staff.” The T.
and G. idea of insurance with trimmings of eatables is all
very good,.so far as it goes, but it doesn’t go far enough ;
it doesn’t give the insured a bite. It opens up an entirely
new field of insurance, in fact, without entering it.
Under table Zls it might offer £IOO at death, and a
Christinas dinner for four ; table Zl7 might give the rates
for endowment policies, and a Sunday dinner after the
maturity of the policy ; while a policy under table Xl9
might be issued to insure you also a quart of morning
milk and three fresh-laid eggs. And when the A.M.P.
establishes a counter-lunch for its policy-holders (under
table Mil), the Temperance and General will be able to
throw out its chest and say that it led the way to all
these reforms. ,

Charles M‘Arthur King held the first Warden’s
Court that sat on the Barrier (N.S.W.) silver-fields.
Broken Hill hgd not been discovered then ; the prospec-
tors had got no further than Thackaringa. He drove
down from Milparinka, over 200 miles, to hear the case—
a “jumping” dispute, of course. “Paddy” Green was
the defendant; he kept a store at Menindie, on the
Darling River, and in the dull season went out-back in
consequence of yarns that travellers had told him. At
heavy expense he shipped a few tons of ore, as a test, to
Europe. The ship got into very bad weather, had to
lighten cargo, and this first lot of Barrier ore was thrown
.overboard. That knocked the heart out of Green for
years, until Sunny Corner began to make a stir. Then
he went out-back again, pegged some claims, and had
£he trouble which brought Warden King down from
his station on the Queensland border.

“ Aurum ” Re crushing from Krohmann’s
claim, Hill End (B. 28/8/’O3). Krohmann’s first good
crushing was 56120 z. from 16 tons ; another, 9000 oz. from
30 tons ; another, 14,9000 z. from 50 tons. Beyers and
Holtermann in one crushing obtained 15,0880 z. from
about 50 tons. Thfeir famous specimen weighed 6401 b.,
and contained about 3000 oz. gold. The crushing which
yielded the highest average per ton, though only
for a small lot, was taken out of Paxton’s claim—lf tons
for 42500 z. Rather tall figures these ; but, then, a richer
field than Hawkins Hill has yet to be found. In the old
Rose of England, 800 oz. was got in one barrow-load of
dirt, and it was so- close to the surface the grass roots
were growing through the flakes of gold. In this claim
I have seen 60oz. taken out while cutting the grip for a
prop and, in places on the boundary between it and the
next a chisel had to be used. Those were Hill End’s
halcyon davs, when the Germans (strange the Fatherland
was so much in evidence in the rich claims of Hill End)
took up a German band from Sydney, and they danced
all day and every day for a week, and raised German
Cain generally. At that time I saw crowds walking over
stone in which you could see the gold 20ft. away. The
gold taken out of Hawkins Hill can only be guessed at,
the battery returns representing merely a portion of it.
“ Tommy ’’frtipot ” : Went cfewn an opal mine
at White Cliffs iN.S.W.) ; depth 40ft. Spent an hour
examining the drives. Timbering is not necessary. The
deepest-mine is only 45ft. down. Opal is found afca
depths, so far as the depths go yet. Possibly some
pioneer will try tor opal at much greater depths, and
succeed brilliantly. Did' ,i’fot. see any opal in the mine.
Picked out a few good specimens of “ potch.” “ Potch ” is
the lowest-grade opal. Some of it is lovely ; yet it is said
to have no commercial value. Many of the opal-gougers
work at night. Quite a number of young fellows,,
engaged during the day in shops, stores and offices, club
together and do a bit of opal-gouging at night and on
weekly half-holidays. The rawest novice has almost asgood
a chance as the most experienced miner. The commonest
sign in White Cliffs is “ schdt and Co., Opal Buyers.”
These shingles are hung out all over the town. The biggest
buyers are nearly all Germans, who act for Continental
firms. “ Made in Germany ” bumps us Australians awk-
wardly even in piebald Outback. These buyers sit at the
hotel’s toff table, with the haughty State officials. The
opal-gougers sit at the “scramble” table—when they are
in funds, which is not always. The miners talk bitterly
about an alleged ring of German opal-buyers; they call
them the “ Potch Push,” “ Too-Plue Push ”; yell at them
in amusement halls ; but they will neither co-operate nor
trust their own countrymen much. They deal with
YacobStrauss, and Rudolf Sauerkraut, and Wilhelm Lager
Bier every time. Opal varies wonderfully in quality.
“Fire" and “ pattern” determine the value. Even
experts fall in at times. Finest opal is worth from £20
to £40 an ounce. It is. said that very little of the best
opal is allowed to remain in- Australia. It goes to Europe,
where so many good things—too good for the blighted
Commonwealthers—go.

A count of the weekly cost per head of in-
patients makes the Sydney the most economically-worked!
hospital in Australia ; the average is £1 5s. 7d. The
Sydney Alfred shows up next, with £1 6s. 9d. ; and the
Melbourne Alfred is only Id. behind that. After these
Brisbane, £1 7s. lOd. ; Adelaide, £1 13s. 5d.; Melbourne,.
£114s. Id. : Hobart, £115s. 5d. ; and Perth, £116s. Jld.

Certain bakers in Melbourne have resorted to a
new device whereby to keep down expenses. The junior
clerk has got the sack, and carters are furnished with
books in which to keep accounts, which they must draw
up every week and collect oh their own. The carter has.
to pay all bad debts out of his own pocket. Sonne extra-
vigorous bakers are even thinking of making the carter-
pay for any falling-off in business, and for depreciation off
the horse.

A lost chance seldom recurs. Heathcote (Vie.),
on the site of the old HTvor diggings, is still scratching
its head with a puzzled look. Old age pensioners,
storekeepers, fossickers and parsons still ask Where's
Lansell ?” Heathcote has never been properly
prospected, and a year ago George Lansell, Ben-
digo’s quartz king, came to the place to take up
some lines of reef. The local residents got wind of
his coming, and when Lansell came he found all the lines
pegged out, and high prices were asked for the blocks.
He took the next train back to Bendigo, and Heathcote
still has its lease-pegs and scenery to admire. Stock,
storekeepers, goats and church bells still bleat: “ Where’s
Lansell ? ”

M.L. State coal mines have, so far, cost £40,000
to develop. The Seddonville has now started to produce
a little ; but the bigger concern, the Point Elizabeih, has
about 12 months of dead work ahead yet.


Thus Blackwood :
Great Britain stands alone among commercial States In
having no national principles. Freetrade, so-called, is
not a principle, but a negation. It means simply the
open door all round ; an ideal condition of society which
has never existed, and is to-day farther out of sight than
ever it was before. Unless the British people are to
remain content with a mere negation, which in the
present state of Europe and America is inconceivable,
they must have a definite fiscal policy like their neigh-
bors. . . . The fiscal policy of Germany . . . has the
peculiar distinction—one vaguely perceived hitherto— of
being in many points a re-production of the fiscal system
we discarded in 1846. The German Imperial tariff of
to-day has a close family resemblance to the British
tariff of the Huskisson period, say from 1822 to 1830.
The German navigation laws of to-day are a revival of
those we finally cast aside in 1849 as antiquated and out
of date. We owe ours to Cromwell, the Bismarck of his
age; and the Germans owe theirs to Bismarck, the
Cromwell of his age. The practical results are before
the world. Cromwell’s policy raised the English navy
from insignificance to the supremacy of the seas.
Bismarck’s has, in the lifetime of a single generation,
Created for the German empire a navy out of nothing,
and has carried the German flag round the world in
keenest rivalry with our own.

12 Reynolds Street, Balmain,
Sydney, October 3rd, 1902.
Dear Sirs : My little daughter, Mar-
jorie, eleven months old lay at death’*
door, from an attack of Whooping Cough.
While in this condition, measles also attacked
her, and all who saw her despaired of her life.
Just then, we were recommended to try Scott’s
Emulsion. From the first dose, it agreed with
her, and, continuing to give it, we had the
satisfaction of .seeing her regain health and
strength and become the fine child you see hex
now by her picture. Scott’s Emulsion, without
doubt, saved her life. Faithfully yours,
(Signed) Mary A. Campbell.
Messrs. Scott & Bowne, Ltd.,
483 Kent-street, Sydney.
HOW DO YOD MEASURE
VALUE when the question to be faced is
the question of your child’s health attacked
by illness ? It is a piteous sight to see medicine
given which only adds to the distress of the
sufferer. Now, if you measure value by what is
accomplished, Scott’s Emulsion stands at the
top of all values in certain illnesses. One
who has seen the cure performed has just told
you about it. We will not tell you anything
more about the illnesses ; you have seen the
sufferings they cause. What we will tell you
is how to avoid these sufferings, or how to put a
stop to them : Give
SCOTT’S EMULSION. That is the
one great fact by which you can measure the
value of what we say and the cure that is
produced. You need only to know that if
measles or whooping cough or any of the
other more serious diseases of child-life
attacks anyone belonging to you, Scott’s
Emulsion will give you the highest value
it is possible to obtain from curative agents.
It acts promptly, cures thoroughly. It has
cured measles and pneumonia in every country
of the globe. It will cure equally well in
Australia. You have one precaution only to
take; and that is to see that on the wrapper
of the bottle there is a picture of a man carry-
ing a big cod-fish; if that cod-fish is hot there,
you arc not getting what we promise you—a
cure! You can obtain a sample of Scott’s
Emulsion and the choicest children’s booklet
of the year, “ A Bunch of Roses,” beautifully
printed in colors, by sending sd. to Scott &
Bowne, Ltd., 483 Kent Street, Sydney, and
mentioning this paper. All chemists sell
Scott’s Emulsion.
SOME CURES.
Exemplifying the curative effects of Warner’s Safe Cure, a few letters from people who have been
cured are subjoined. As millions of bottles of Warner’s Safe Cure, however, have been sold in Aus-
tralasia, it is easy for anyone, by making inquiry amongst personal friends, to hear of many similar
cases.
Kidney Complaint. Mr. John Lovell, of 45 Balmain Street, Richmond, Victoria, says :
. “It is with pleasure that I write in regard to my recovery from a very bad attack of Kidney
Complaint. I was taken so ill that I had to be brought home and laid on the couch. I thought that
I had a paralytic stroke, as I seemed to have lost all muscular motion in my back. I had been hale
and hearty up till that time, and could only account for my attack as being caused by a sudden chill
in the kidneys. I received advice, and was duly prescribed medicine, but I derived no benefit. Then
a friend recommended me to try Warner’s Safe Cure. I did so, and the relief was speedy and wonder-
ful. In two weeks I was out and about my work again. Since that time I have had no return of the
complaint, and am now in the best of health.—l9th August, 1902.”
Stone in the Bladder. Mr. James Grant, Grocer, 126 Young Street, Annandale, N.S.W.,
says ■
“Some ten years ago I was attacked by great pains in the back and groin, which at times were so
severe that I almost screamed with agony. I was treated by doctors for fully five years, and also
tried several patent medicines, but obtained no relief. lat last despaired of ever getting well again,
but was recommended by a friend to try Warner’s Safe Cure, as it had given him immense relief in a
similar case. I followed his advice, and, after taking the medicine for a while, I passed a stone about
three-quarters of an inch long and a quarter of an inch wide. I am pleased to say that, after this
stone had come away, my sufferings were at an end, and I have not suffered in the slightest degree
since. Manv of my friends know of my case, and I always keep the stone I passed. I can confidently
recommend Warner’s Safe Cure in cases like mine, as I am thoroughly convinced that it saved me
many years of agony, if not my very life itself. —12th 1 ebruary, 190.3.”
Bladder Disease. Captain W. J. Stuart, Master Mariner, Station Avenue, Coburg,
Victoria, says :
“It is with much pleasure that I beg to inform you of the great benefit I have derived from
taking Warner’s Safe Cure. In the early part of last January I had a chill, which turned to a very
severe attack of Inflammation of the Bladder. I consulted two doctors, and after examining me each
said it was a disease common to men of my age (I am over 60). and that I could only get relief by
using an instrument, as medicine would do me no good. I positively refused to let either of them
use an instrument on me, but at once procured a bottle of Warner s Safe Cure. I conscientiously and
truthfully declare that before finishing the first bottle I got absolute relief, and began to feel better in
every respect. J have continued to take the medicine, and my health has wonderfully improved.
My previous troubles have entirely disappeared, and I am no longer disturbed during the night. I
am in as good health now as I can ever, expect to be, and my recovery is entirely due to V arner s
Safe Cure. I carefully observed the diet directions given in your book. I most strongly recommend
Warner’s Safe Cure to anyone who suffers as I did, and can only add that to me it has proved in-
valuable.—6th April, 1903.”
Liver Disease. Miss lima Ross, of 198 Archer St., North Ac’elai le, S.A., says
“Some four years ago my general good health failed me, and I suffered from severe headaches at
least once a week, constant debility, and loss of vitality. At times I had pain and weakness in my
back. My appetite became poor and digestion bad. I consulted medical men, who pronounced the
cause of my illness to be Disease of the Liver, and gave me medicine to take, but, as weeks passed and
I was getting no better, I became alarmed, and decided finally to try Warner’s Safe Cure. I con-
tinued to take this medicine for three weeks, and felt better each day. My appetite returned, weak-
ness and pain left me, and in about a month I was as well as ever. Had I taken Warner s Safe Cure
at the commencement of my illness, I feel sure I should have been cured sooner, and so have saved
doctors’ bills.—llth December, 1902.”
Dyspepsia.. Mr. T. H. Cook, Belleview Street, Parramatta, N.S.W., says
“ I have been a great sufferer for about 20 years from Chronic Dyspepsia. During that time I can safely say that
I have spent £2OO on doctors, and the host of doctors, and only got at any time but slight relief fiom thejr medicines.
I suffered terribly with pains in the chest and stomach, and also across the shoulders and kidneys, besides suffering
from constipation. I always felt very drowsy, but could get but little sleep. I have lived for years on slop food ;
iii6cit cabbage, potatoes or pastry of anv kind would almost kill me. I was recommended by a friend, about 12
months ago, to try what Warner’s Safe Cure and Warner’s Safe Pills would _do for me. I took the advice, and can
truly say that since that time I have felt like a new man.—4th March, 1903.”
Rheumatism, Mrs. Nellie Davidson, 32 Keig Street, Newtown, N.S.W., says
“ When living in Boggabri, about 18 months ago, I was laid up for nearly the whole winter with Rheumatism*
and could not obtain any relief from any of the several medicines I took. One day I saw a pamphlet, issued by you,
in which was described a case similar to mv own, and I decided to try whether Warner’s Safe Cure would also benefit
me I took three bottles of the medicine, and am very glad to say that I was completely cured and could go about
my work cheerfully. I have not felt the slightest symptom of the return of any rheumatic pain since that time.—
16th February, 1903.”

The House of Dodery.
A Tasmanian gentleman (name not given, leal
the Upper House should slay him with its natural
weapon, the stone axe) is responsible for this :
Whoever publishes in a civilised country any true
description of Tasmania’s House of Dodery must inevit-
ably come under suspicion of being a decorative liar.
I rush on my fate.
In all the world only one House of Dodery is possible,
hence there never could be more than one Vandemonia.
As the ancient spirit dies, old Vandemonia will disappear.
It is disappearing now. The House of Dodery may be
aptly described as the residue of grey slime left by
Vanished years. Of those years, the System was the
head and front and mainspring. The System was the
soul of all things, and on the System all things depended ;
about the System, Vandemonia lived and moved and had
its cat and its gallows and its being generally. The
System is dead. Vandemonia will die. Thank God !
Here, very gently catalogued, are a few Doderyites of
to-day
Adye Douglas, President. Aged 88. Douglas is the
god of Douglas ; and there is one devil, Modernity.
Douglas hates the Devil even more than he loves Douglas.
The devil has never even heard of Douglas. As President
of an alleged legislative chamber the method of Douglas
is original and peculiar. He joins freely in all discussions
from the chair. When any irreverent Doderyite threatens
to dispute his autocracy he spits like a clawless cat in a
lofty hen-roost. He is the Only' Douglas. He is welcome
to the distinction.
George Collins. A protegb and admirer of Douglas,
from his boyhood up. Collins was the most con-
spicuous flaw in the Lewis Ministry, the most ineffectual
politician ever born. Collins is the dreariest Tory in the
world, and probably the most bitterly respectable medi-
ocrity in the universe. But in the House of Dodery he is
a Great Man.
William Crosby. An old-time merchant, honest in
business. Politically no class, but dogmatic in his
decrepitude. As he is a very old and musty Dry Bone,
endowed with no glimmer of originality or ivit, the
House of Dodery naturally regards Crosby as a pillar of
the State and a maker of history, lie’s neither. He’s
just Crosby.
Charles Ellis Davies. Said to be proprietor of the
Vandemonian “ leading daily.’’ The Mercury made flesh.
Favorite son of the late John Davies. Politically nonde-
script, he is a reverential upholder of the flights of
Property, Davies being not much over 50, the House of
Dodery regards him with some suspicion as a mere boy in
politics. He has the traditions of Vandemonia. Occa-
sionally he travels—along beaten tracks, by tourist
conveyances. Then he writes books, dreadful books that
die. He is ambitious. Would like to be Premier. But
won’t.
William Dodery. In his own person the prime ex-
ponent and quintessence of Doderyism. Holds that an
idea is a sort of crime. Has no criminal tendencies.
Made his money as a publican. In his House he is Chair-
man of Committees. Further comment would be libellous.
William Hart. Devout Doderyite. S nnetimes comes
to Parliament, but this dissipation is becoming rare.
Was in business originally. Made money. Extraordinary
luck.
William Moore. Progressive Doderyite grown old.
Held office in various Vandemonian administrations.
Initial qualities might have developed profitably in
another atmosphere. Very old. Very querulous. Very
out-of-date. Very Vandemonian.
Arthur Morrisby. Leads (without portfolio) for
Propsting’s Government. Political amateur of alleged
democratic tendencies. Lacks nerve. Means well.
Never likely to do anything.
Alfred Page. One of the Pages of Vandemonia. In-
tellectually,a Prince of the House of Dodery. Personally,
an extremely good fellow. Politically, the queerest mix-
ture conceivable. Looks like Cupid grown old. Said to
feel much the same way.
Robert S. Scott. Confirmed Doderyite. Irish accent.
Over the average height. That’s all.
John Watchorn. Venerable Vandemonian. Later life
embittered by disappointment over a gaud. True old
gentleman fossilised ; frowsy old opinions run to seed.
This is the House which vetoes Tasmanian democracy,
and is proud of it. This is the House which has never
passed a democratic measure. Tasmania now tardily
faces the position that no good thing is possible till the
curse of Doderyism is removed. And an attack on
Doderyism is now imminent.

The Victorian Inspector-General of Gaols, in his
annual report, expresses himself as a perplexed
and flurried man in the matter of indeterminate
sentences, now so much discussed. The idea of
the indeterminate sentence is that, when a
criminal has been convicted so often that he may
be said to have become habitual, he shall be
g laced under restraint, not for any stated period,
ut until he is fit to be at large. If he doesn’t
become fit to be at large, his imprisonment ia
supposed to be for life. And the Inspector-
General wants to know how anybody will be able
to tell when a prisoner is fit to be at large. No-
body can answer that question with any cer-
tainty. Some day, the X-rays may be so far
improved that the proper authority may be able
to look into a prisoner’s stomach and read his
hidden motives, but at present the world is just
like this large helpless boss policeman—it doesn’t
know. Perhaps some day, when Australia has a
navy of its own, it may try the experiment of
putting its rising young criminals on board ship
for seven years’ compulsory service. A whole lot
of offences—burglary, forgery, welshing, bigamy,
pulling racehorses, using bad language to girls,
loafing at street corners, stealing horses, cattle,
sheep and fowls, over-driving horses, setting fire
to tne squatter’s grass, assaulting policemen,
refusing to pay tram-fares, travelling by rail on
expired tickets, trespassing on enclosed premises,
breach of copyright, jury-squaring, vagrancy,
stealing lead off roofs, founding bogus banks,
being a fraudulent trustee, contempt of court, and
so on—are practically impossible at sea. In fact,
as regards the young criminal—unless scuttling
ships is his idiosyncrasy—a long spell at sea under
naval discipline would always have a tendency to
divert his thoughts into some new direction.
Annual report of Vie. Public Service Com-
missioner Topp shows how the Irvine Adminis-
tration, which was elected to “keep politics pure ”
and “ free departments from political influence,”
does its work. Topp complains that he has,
several times during the past year, been asked to
issue certificates authorising the retention of
officers over the age limit, without a single fact
being submitted to support the request. On
other occasions the Government has sent him
orders that officers under the retiring age should
be thrown out, no reason being adduced. Topp
states that he kicked against these illegal orders,
but apparently without effect. He adds that,
under the Public Service Act, which gives him
the control of the service in order to secure freedom
from political influence, he possesses power to over-
ride the decision of a departmental head on appeal
from an officer. Mine professional officer who had
vainly sought to obtain promotion through his
chief, successfully appealed to Topp. According
to the Act the decision should have been given
effect to, but the Irvine crowd simply ignored
what it is nominally compelled by law to do, and
the officer in question still gets the lower pay.
The position is much the same as if a Judge con-
victing one of T. Bent’s supporters for burglary
should find his sentence of six months delivered
to the empty air and his prisoner “taking a
lunar” at him from the solicitors' table.
For cool cynicism a French criminal,
Pascal Bruyeneer, who recently had his head
extracted for the murder of his paramour, would
be hard to beat. Pascal came to the guillotine
with a fresh cigarette in his mouth, and bowed to
several friends in the crowd. One called out —
‘‘Don’t you want a match?” “Oh, no,” was the
prompt reply— "l’ll light up when I get there!"

The co. has been handicapped lately by having to
square heavy claims in regard to subsidences and the
■ removal of coal from under allotments which belonged to
other people. That and the futile Walsh Island bore cost
the co. £6251 in the last two years ; and as it didn’t have
a reserve fund of any sort, in spite of the big profits of
the past, the money had to come out of revenue. As it is
reckoned that the co. has no more than 80,000 tons of coal
left in the old property, and as a half-year’s output runs
to over 50,000 tons, it became necessary to think about
either winding up or getting another property; and a
recent meetingdeeided on the latter. The new mine con-
sists of leaseholds in the Maitland district; and the co. is
wishing now harder than ever that it had built up a
reserve with which to develop the new property.

Cue Gr.M. and Exploration, Day Dawn (W.A.),
after erecting the 20-head mill bought from the Ivanhoe
last May, is practically at a standstill. The co. owns 17
leases in four groups round about the Great Fingall, and,
according to published plans, the Fingall reef conveni-
ently twists in and out so as to traverse each group. The
' mill is capable of treating 2000 tons monthly ; but, before
it was purchased, no attempt was made to thoroughly
develop ore reserves, and the prediction in Buiabtin of
June 20 “ that the mine is pretty certain to prove a
failure no matter how good it may really be,” looks very
likely to be fulfilled. The directors of this five-times
reconstructed concern have already spent about £70,000
in proving little else than that they are not the best
directors in the world. Manager Hoskings, like many
- more, has a- hard row to hoe when controlled by such a
galaxy.
* * * *
Great Eingall Southern Blocks (W.A.), a third
reconstruction of the old Weld Hercules, has shut down
on three months’exemption for a breather. A year ago
the co. was alleged to have cut the Great Fingall reef at
a depth of 1500 ft., but the ore only averaged 3dwt. per
ton for a width of 24ft. It was then estimated that
£IOO,OOO .would be required to develop the mine to the
requisite depth, and this amount is hardly likely to be
forthcoming. In the interval more diamond drilling has
been done, which only served to show that the proposi-
tion is hopeless.
.«■ • * • *
Island Eureka (W.A.) looks like having to face
a bad time. The adjoining Golconda, whose workings in
No. 2 shaft, according to manager Martin, are only 9ft.
from the'Eureka’s workings, is claiming compensation
since 1897'for part cost of pumping to keep the mine dry.
The Golconda is hard up, and all developments are
stopped'; yet the co. is, so the Eureka people assert,
compelled by law to keep the water down to prevent the
flooding of the Eureka. This costs £BO a month, and, if
insisted upon, the Golconda co. threatens to throw up
the sponge and leave the Eureka to drain its own mine.
The aocuniulation of water in the Golconda mine is
estimated at 450,000 gallons, and, if this breaks through
into the Eureka, a bad catastrophe may happen. In spite
of official predictions a year ago that there was three
years’ payable ore in sight, and three years’ divs. in
prospect, returns have been very irregular since January.
There have been no divs.; and the immediate future
looks far from rosy.
* * * *
Associated Northern (W.A.) has struck a ray of
hope, wh‘at may prove to be one of the long-sought
rich chute, s having been pierced by a drill put up from
the bottom workings. The new plant is making good
headway, and the buildings covering it form a most
imposing structure, but the small amount of payable
reserves is a serious menace to prolonged prosperity.
Neither Landau nor the Doolette faction come well out
of the controversy over the past working of the mine.
Landau’s' reference to the successful working of the
Associated as a feather in his cap is especially unfortu-
nate, seeing that he was chairman in 1899, when, for
about six months, the returns from this and three
other properties were practically quadrupled, and then
fell away to less than the normal. The shareholders
would probably be best served by an entirely new board,
though even that would not undo the harm already done
by gutting out the richest ore.
• * • •
Lake View South (W.A.) may yet do some
good out of the Robinson mine, Kanowna, which was
taken over about a year ago. Prior to that the Robinson
had treated some 40,( 00 tons for 35,0000 z., nearly all won
from above the 100 ft. level. Owing to the reef at the
200 ft. level being low grade the property was condemned,
and work practically suspended by the co. Tributors
went on; and the present manager, who was the boss
tributor, did so well out of the tribute that he treated
himself to a voyage round the world. The property con-
tains a regular network of reefs consisting of very large
bodies of free-milling quartz. At 300 ft. level two reefs
have been cut, one 20ft. and the other 12ft. wide. The
average value of the first is Bdwt., and of the second
13dwt Both would pay well were the mine properly
equipped with a large mill of heavy stamps, but, unfortu-
nately, all the surface fixings are antediluvian.
I*• • *
Oroya-Brown Hill (W.A.) is now running 50-
head of stamps, and should produce ll,ooooz. of fine
gold’ monthly, and be level with Ivanhoe and Fingall.
Ivanljoe has 200,000 shares, Fingall 250,000, and Oroya-
Brown Hill 450,000. Thus the 0.-B.H. has as many shares
as the other two combined, and, as a mine, it is certainly
not worth them, though its prospects are undoubtedly
good, pie winze from the No. 10, or lowest level, is down
over 100 ft., and continues in ore worth from 6oz. to Boz.,
but it must not be forgotten that it is following the dip
of the rich telluride chute, and is no criterion of the real
value of the lode itself. The cost of production should
now be materially reduced, partly from the increase in
milling power and partly from the reduced cost of transit
through sending the ore from the Oroya by the aerial
tram instead of by drays. There is little doubt that the
co. will pay substantial divs. for a long time ; still, out-
side the rich chute, the Brown Hill lode is distinctly dis-
appointing. In the Oroya south block the lode is much
more uniform in grade, although the average is consider
ably lower—about 15dwt. so far as tested.
• • • •
During October W.A. mines distributed divs.
totalling £174,060, the amount being made up asfol.ows :
Great Fingall, £75,000; Ivanhoe; £50,000; Brown Hill
Extended, £25,000 ; Kalgoorlie, £15,000 ; Ida H., £5400 ;
Queensland Menzies, £3300; and Lancef ed, £360. This
brings up the total for the ten months to £1,639,911.
These figures ere already ahead of those of any year except
1899—the 'amous boom year, when everything was sacri-
rt -■ 1 to manipulating the market by gutting the mines.

* “ Yes," said the buttons at an Adelaide hotel, “ Madam
Melba stayed here. She was a corker. You 'ad to attend
to ’er else she’d snap yer 'ead orf. Sometimes I’d keep
’er waitin’ for half-a-second, and it were a wonder she
didn't smash the bell the way she would bang it. She
wouldn’t allow me to bring in one card by itself ; she’d
make me wait till there was a lot, and then I’d ’ave to
waltz in with ’em on a plate. ‘What are they?’ she
would ask. ‘Cards, Madam.’ Then she’d flare up. ‘I
don’t want them. _ Bring them ’ere.’ She’d tear them all
up and throw the pieces in theplate. ‘Burn them. You may
go.’ One day I ’ad to laugh at the way she tore them
cards to shivers, and almost got the sack. One fairly ’ot
day she rang for me, and as I went into the room she
pretty near knocked me down with a rug. ‘Take that,
and that, and that,’ she said, throwin’ three more at me ;
‘ it’s too ’ot to ’ave ’em ’ere.’ ’’
Herr Winschermann, who appeared in Sydney with his
performing bears under the management of Fuller and
Rickards, was lately reported to be dying in a New York
hospital, having been practically torn to ribbons by his
big bear Tony. Their relations here seemed to be very
cordial, so much so that the local Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals gave him a medal for his
humane taming of wild beasts, though knowing ones
winked the other eye. Winschermann came to Australia
with Wirths’ show. He had a contract to tame three
tigers, but before the vessel had been a week out of
Penang he struck disaster in the tigers’ den and reached
Perth Hospital in a very much chewed condition.
After that he ran the bears; but even a bear has its
dangers.
Judging by the fearsome performances that take
place at Ballarat (Vic.) under the name of the South
Street competitions, this afflicted country is by way of
becoming completely engrossed in the great “ spouting ”
industry. Starting in 1890 with 250 competitors for £5O
worth of prizes, this great annual spree now boasts over
6000 blatant youths and maidens heaving masses of
“ eloquence ” off their chests for guineas and half-sovs.
totalling £l3OO. This spouting is enjoj'ed nightly by
crowded audiences in three halls for the space of a solid
month—and Ballarat survives. The blessed “competi-
tions ” range from band performances to comic recitals,
all the way through serio-comic and moderately-
humorous, for infants, youths and adults. They
draw so well that special trains are run from all parts
to hear the rising generation declaim Tell’s “Soliloquy
on the Death of His Brindled Pup,” or something equally
solemn. If the energy these 6000 would-be orators put
into their orations and the preparation therefor were
expended on something useful, Australia would have a
lot more post-holes to show than it has now.
“ Spinifex ” : There is a fortune awaiting the right kind
of biograph, or whatever they call the thing that charges
you a penny to look into the hole in the gas-meter, and
then buzzes at you like a vulture in a bottle. That
machine always breaks off just as the extreme wicked-
ness is going to happen, and if it could be arranged that
the wickedness would really happen for 3s. 6d.—a penny
for everything up to the horror, and then 3s. 6d. for the
horror if you feel you must have the horror—there would
be money in it. A lot of people would take the horror.
Passed away from senile decay, in Melbourne Hospital,
aged 92, Charles Upson, the oldest actor in Australia.
For some years he had drawn a pension from the
Superannuated Actors’ Fund.
“ Haresfoot ” : The new Geelong (Vic.) theatre opened
on Tuesday night last, with great eclat. This is the well-
known Exhibition Building done up by the City Corpora-
tion at a cost of £5OOO, and seating 1500. The old theatre
was a good brick one. It fell out of use in the last
generation, after an honorable career, in which Brooke
and Coppin figured. Afterwards it became a brewery,
and then the Salvation Army barracks.
“ J.A.C.”: “The death is reported of Sam Poole, a
comedian who had seen better days. He acquired a cer-
tain reputation for his playing of Jacky Jacky, the
aboriginal Australian in “Never too Late to Mend,”
although his rendering of the character was not re-
markable ; in fact, he played many other parts much
better. Another reported demise, that of J. B. Steele,
slaughtered to make a S.M. Herald paragraph, is, fortu-
nately, not authentic. John Blennerhasset Steele is still
alive.
The Musical Festival people secured ex-Jubilee singer
Hamilton Hodges for the Wellington (M.L.) oratorical
orgy, fixed to begin on the 23rd. Hodges is a dark-
brown baritone of pleasing voice. The committee, some
weeks before, had arranged that Arthur Ballance, a fine,
vigorous, but, alas, local, baritone, should be Lucifer in
“ The Golden Legend,” but that mere local person had
the audacity to ask for moneys for his services. Sooner
than pay him, the darkey was secured in Auckland at
great expense,
A recent visiting music-maker said he would not live in
Australia for £50,000 a year. “ There is not ze art, ze

“ Cheetah ” : I have been shaved 12
times by a lady barber. She was young and pretty,
but as a shaver she was only moderate. The best
part of it was when she was wiping me up with
the damp towel and powder-puffing me ; then she
gazed soulfully into my eyes as if she had thoughts
of kissing me. I went back eleven times to see
if she would kiss me, but she didn’t. On my
thirteenth visit a man shaved me; and told me
his wife had gone to the theatre to see somebody’s
horror in six acts. I didn’t know she was married.
I am growing whiskers now.

The niceties of language. A man out in
the New South Wales mulga was charged with
abducting al5 year-old girl. The local constable,
interviewing him, said, “You had better tell me
where the girl is;” and he made a statement
which went down in the force’s note-book. At
Deniliquin Assizes the point was taken that the
statement, which was of much importance,
couldn’t be used as evidence, because by using the
word “better ” the force had held out an induce-
ment. Justice Pring agreed, shut the statement
out, and the case broke down —although it was
said there was a defence on the merits in any case.
About the downfall of a Royal idol.—
King Edward, it seems, has not scrupled to express his
disrespect for the late Queen’s pet fad—John Brown.
All the statues and busts of that pampered gillie havs
been taken from their places of honor at Balmoral and
elsewhere, and cast into obscurity. His mother’s notorious
friendliness towards Brown was always an annoyance to
Albert Edward. He viewed the situation with worldly eyes,
from the man’s point of view, whilst the Sovereign Lady
V.R. considered herself at liberty to act just as she
pleased where flunkeys were concerned. Probably Vic-
toria was the only woman in Britain who didn’t know
that John Brown had become a national joke, not to say
a ribald jest. Brown flourished on the strength of his
sturdy Scawtish self-possession, which marked him as an
“original” in the first place, and which he afterwards
cultivated as a policy, John being hard-headed and wide-
awake. He was a young gardener at Balmoral when
Queen Victoria and Prince Albert discovered the differ-
ence between him and all other servants on the estate.
They spoke to him casually, and he started a conversation
Instead of making a weak, grovelsome reply, and so they
got into the habit of talking to Brown, in order to draw
him out. The Queen was for making a personal
attendant of the bluff gardener, but Prince Albert, who
was only a supreme servant himself, blew cold on the
proposal, and said that Brown would cease to be the same
Brown if they took him in out of the wet. Albert, how-
ever, died, and was buried, and his widow’s liking for
Brown developed into a sentimental regard. The gar-
dener with whom she and “Albert the Good "(fairly
Good) had so often yarned was called to her side, and
there he remained for more than 20 years—a servant
ruling his mistress in small household matters through
his lack of obsequiousness, a constant subject for
irreverent newspaper paragraphs which the Queen never
saw or heard of, an amazing spectacle for foreign visitors,
and a cause of irritation to her family. Relatives had
to profess to accept Brown at the Queen’s valuation, and
they didn’t like it. After his death they were expected
to heave a sigh when the old lady introduced them to the
latest bust or statue of Brown. The memory of Brown
became a grievance, but they had to sigh and bear it as
long as V.R. bossed the show. At last came the day
when they could exclaim--* 1 La Reine est morte ; D n
Brown I"

“ A.S.” writes from Vienna :
To work off the accumulated humors of a season of
feasting, all Europe—the monarch, the merchant, and
the money-lender—with its female escort, in the summer
fills its stomach with vile-tasting mineral water, and all
to fit it for more feasting. From this pre-prandial course
at Marienbad King Ned made his entry this week into
the brilliant capital of Austria. In a city of uniforms he
had perforce to don the garb of his honorary regiment—
the Uhlans—but Edward cuts a poor figure in military
dress. His width is too great for his height, and he lacks
the alertness which makes the German Kaiser appear, in
spite of his withered arm, the most soldierly monarch in
Europe. He appears to better advantage in clothes for
the most part of his own invention—the frock coat and
the marvellous fancy waistcoat. With the conventional
tall hat he looks what he is—a genial, gentlemanly
nonentity! Part of the festivities comprised a special
performance at the opera, certainly finer than anything
in Germany, and the drama, “The Red Robe.” This
latter was vetoed in London as being unfit for the goody
English playgoer, but at the special request of King Ned
it formed part of the programme, and was played by the
Viennese artists with a dash and verve which moved
even the blas6 man in the frock-coat out of his usual
stogidity.

“ D.”: An Australian is more easily halted
whenonthemove than almost any other man on the
earth. Saw 7014 grown-up persons standing in
front of an outfitter’s shop, a few nights back, and
rushed across the street fully expecting to see the
outfitter hanging dead in his own shop window.
Was disgusted at finding only a young lady with
a shipload of self-possession using the window as
a trying-on room. We want a walking craze. Any
idea that will make an Australian walk 10 miles

Auatralia’s biggest State pub., owned by
the Westralian Government at Gwalia, is far-and-
away ahead of most mining-town pubs. As it
stands—a two-storey brick building, well fitted —
it cost £6OOO. The architect provided for a private
as well as a public bar; but the fierce democracy
of the little goldfield ruled that out promptly, and
the proposed saloon was turned into a smoking
room. It is run by a salaried manager and his
• . rn , . n , , • _ .i
wife. There is no fixed restriction as to the num-
her of drinks a man may have; he may, in fact,
'"““I" «" comfortably carry. When
that limit seems about reached the manager is
called in, runs his experienced eye over the cus-
. . ,‘L , . , ~
tomer, and pronounces judgment from which there
is no appeal. The liquor isn’t particularly cheap,

From Adelaide :
Paris Nesbit, K. 0., had a fine case to argue at Adelaide
criminal sittings recently in defending one Moulson, on
a charge of manslaughter. Prisoner, who is 62, had been
in the habit of taking in and sheltering a widow of 36,
whenever Pittman, her usual protector, became more
violent than usual. The latter was the hero of a sensa-
tional murder trial at Broken Hill in 1897, a coroner’s
jury finding a verdict against him in respect of a body
found in a shaft, but proof being insufficient at
the trial. Also the widow had several times had
him imprisoned for ill-treating her. One night last
month he hammered her in a wine-saloon, missed
her later on, followed her to the old man’s place
(a single room in an iron shed, 12ft. by 6ft.), and
started to smash the door in. As he entered, old Moul-
son, after a single warning, shot him dead, surrendering
to the police immediately after. Counsel made a fine
dramatic scene of the midnight tragedy, and the jury
only took five minutes to make it not guilty.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You are looking to the West
Blue Eyes and Dimples—
Where the clouds are tipped with gold rays ;
But the clouds within your eyes
Tell of sorrow and unrest,
Blue Eyes and Dimples ;
Are you thinking of the old days
In the homestead on the rise ?
There are tears within your eyes,
Gold Hair and Dimples ;
Tears of bitter, empty longing
For the life that might have been ;
But the sunset splendor dies,
Gold Hair and Dimples,
Tho’ the dear dead days come thronging
From the weary years between.
You are thinking of me yet,
Blue Eyes and Dimples ;
I can hear you softly crying
And your hot tears sear my brain ;
For I can’t—I can’t forget,
Blue Eyes and Dimples ;
But the golden glow is dying—
And your hot tears fall in vain.

SPINIFEX.
“ H.C.” writes from Hobart :
The old Kangaroo, better known locally as the Twins,
which ferries live stock and vehicles between Hobart and
Bellerive (Tas.), is generally mistaken by visitors for an
old boiling-down shed swept into the harbor by a flood.
A more extraordinary craft was never drawn by a child
on its first slate. Writer was invited to inspect the relic
on the slip when undergoing its scraping. Split an old
barge from stem to stern, and bridge the two sections
sufficiently wide apart to admit a paddle-wheel in the
middle, and you have the hull of the Twins. On deck,
amidships, is a barn-like structure of weather-boards with
a stove-pipe sticking up through the roof, suggestive of
Dan’l Peggotty’s ’umble ’ome, described in “ David
Copperfield.” The deck is square, with a huge rudder at
each end, fixed on the corner of the outfit, and when the
stormy winds do blow, all hands and the engineer have
to hang on to the ponderous iron tiller. Though it is
stated that the piston-rod of the old beam-engine hasn’t
worn a fraction in 46 years, the equally astonishing fact
is omitted that Captain James S. Taylor’s belltopper,
which was shipped at the same time, hasn’t lost a par-
ticle of its original gloss. On a bright morning, when
the Twins is pushing off from the Bellerive wharf on its
half-hour voyage, the reflection of the sun from the Cap-
tain’s head-gear can be distinctly seen in Hobart. The
people who have bought this relic (the Twins, not the
belltopper) started the Bellerive ferry business with a
whale-boat and a hard pull across for Is. Now they have
some of the smartest and cleanest ferry steamers south of
the Line. They burn only wood, so that the decks and
seats are not covered with soot, as in most of our ferry-
boats. Even the flies wipe their feet before alighting on
the Victory and Golden Crown, and the brass-work is the
special care of the son of a M.L.A. It is feared, now
these painfully clean people own her, that the Twins is
in danger of having its picturesque ugliness ruined by
paint and brass-work. A petition is being circulated
lay the Tourists’ Association requesting that nothing be
done to modernise the ancient ark, which has provided so
much innocent enjoyment for visitors from the mainland,
and that Captain Taylor’s belltopper be not interfered
W'ith.
“ Squeers ’’—who is in the kid-whacking
business—writes:
The Melbourne young idea amuses himself nowadays
by clapping together two pieces of stick or bone, or any-
thing else clappable which conies to hand. T’other day,
a young pupil of mine approached me in school-time, and
asked me if he might put “ his bones ” in the cupboard.
Was rather shocked for a moment —wondered if the youth
was tired of life, but was relieved to find it was not his
own bones, but those of a deceased sheep, which he wished
to put away for safety. The young idea feminine has a
newer and stranger mode of amusement. Directly school
is dismissed there is a rush of small girls to the top of the
yard, where they fill in time by making miniature graves.
The school-yard at present is converted into a toy ceme-
tery. Perhaps it is the drought habits of this country
that make the Australian child’s thoughts run to bones
and graves.

It was only a while back that the Mel-
bourne police put in a lot of hard graft running
the frail but persistent Flossie and her “em-
ployer” out of Lonsdale-street, with the result
that the temples of Venus were temporarily
handed over to Ah Fat, the cabinet-maker, and
Fatta Cliand, the hawkers’ supplier. Yet it was
sworn in the City Court lately that “busi-
ness ” in that locality was again so brisk that one
lady of scant virtue had been dispossessed of her
“stand” by a more enterprising competitor of
similar morals who had actually offered the land-
lord a bonus of £5O for the house, in addition to
an extortionate rent. P.M. Panton expressed re-
gret that the law didn’t allow him to “ deal with ”
this landlord. But Victoria doesn’t deal with
such men. It rather considers them specially
fitted to make its laws, and when they get suffi-
cient rent from the house that is let to Flossie it
holds them qualified to sit in the Legislative
Council

Years ago a Salvarmy officer wrote to
headquarters suggesting that the branch at Dirn-
boola(Vic.), should be closed as “the place was
completely given over to the devil.” It was a
hopeless spot—like Sodom without any collection.
Another Salvarmy officer has now presented his
report, and it seems that Dimboola is still given
over to the devil. The new man reckons roughly
that out of 600 inhabitants 550 are Lost, and he
doesn’t seem so enthusiastic as he might be about
the other 50. After missioning in many countries,
he says Dimboola is the toughest place he has
struck, and its blood will be on its own head,
where it will probably serve instead of a hat.

The Episcopal Church in Australia still
pleads that its Australian-trained clergy who go
to Britain should be accepted there as British-
trained clergy are accepted in Australia. But the
haughty Britisher shows no sign of relaxing.
The “colonial” must undergo an examination.
Why not, instead of pleading, formally demand
reciprocity? The Universities had to do that, or
their degrees would be yet under the “colonial”
cloud.
A FATMAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One gracious day of Spring,
When Care itself took wing,
And Grief went gipsying ;
Upon a harbor boat
I found myself afloat,
Reading what Omar wrote.
The verses gravely gay,
With their rich shadow-play,
Seemed fitted to the day.
For never sun rose yet
On me, but, ere it set,
I had to pay some debt.
So Omar with his free
Drown-care Philosophy
Is just the Bard for Me.
Then I became aware
That closer grew the air—
A Fatman faced me there.
He spoiled the day so fine,
And soured the sweet sunshine,
That Fatman friend of mine.
Yet he was bravely drest
In garments of the best—
Rich Broadcloth of the Blest.
But out of every pore
Of him exuded more
Pride than would fit a score.
His hands showed many a ring—
Hands made to clutch and cling
When strongest Ape was King.
His mouth was like a vice—
Shut fast with cold, concise
Relentless Avarice.
Self-made was, you could see,
This gross-built deity,
Fat hand upon fat knee;
And yet he was a pure,
Unspeakably cocksure
Human caricature.
With loathing unexpressed
I marked the curving crest
Of his pearl-buttoned vest.
The Paunch it covered was
His lonesome Creed and Cause,
His Gospel and his Laws.
He bore it with fine flaunt,
As ’tvvere the sacrosanct
Ark of the Covenant.
Hungry at times, and dry,
I’ve wandered ’neath the sky—
But change with him ? Not I.
I envy not the man,
T’ll keep unto my clan—
Dead-broke, Bohemian.
For though we don’t, indeed,
At piling coin succeed,
Yet Omar we can read—
And smoke, and drink, and seize
Some little times of ease
’Twixt two Eternities.

Mr. Hearne.—
“ Dear Sir, —I enclose for your own private perusal
portion of a letter received from my mother, Mrs.
of London, England, from which you will glean that
your medicine has been a perfect God-send to a martyr to
colds and bronchial asthma. I do not wish any names to
be mentioned, but you are at liberty to make use of any
portion of this letter you choose, and you can confidently
refer anybody to me.
“ I heard of your excellent remedy, and sent it to Eng-
land. You can see for yourself what an immense success
it was.—Yours faithfully, .”
Extract from letter alluded to above
“You will be interested in hearing that I think the
Bronchitis Cure really excellent. I was very bad when it
arrived, and I immediately flew to it. That was last
Friday, and it has quite cured me. Dr. is very
much interested in it. He came yesterday, and earned
off the empty bottle to find out if he could get a full one
from a chemist who is in a large way here.”
The names are withheld from publication, but will be
supplied privately when desired.

“Dergholm, Victoria.
Dear Sir,—i wish to add mv testimony to the won-
derful effect of your Bronchitis Cure. I suffered for nine
months, and the cough was so distressingly bad at nights
I was obliged to get up and sit by the fire. I had medical
advice, and tried other * remedies,’ without avail. I tried
yours, and never had a fit of coughing after taking the
first dose, and though I have had but two bottles I feel I
am a different man, and the cough has vanished. You
may depend upon my making known the efficacy of your
wonderful remedy to anyone I see afflicted.
“Yours faithfully,
“ JAMES ASTBURY.”
We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it was per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power. Signed bv

Starry Eyes.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I dream to-night, with drowsy eyes
A-swim with glorious tears unshed,
Of a grand loveliness ’neath skies
That beamed above us starry-red.
The world went down to sleep, and you
And I came out to love alone.
Ah, drowsy curls ! ah, life to woo !
And Starry Eyes, my own, my own !
I dream to-night of arms a-twine
About my neck for evermore;
You raised your head and laid with mine
Warm cheeks of love. The shining shore
Of Summer seas, the stars of God,
The world beyond the listless sea,
Fled out; upborne, our fain feet trod
A fairy land of phantasy !
I dream to-night the ecstasy
Within, without us, as we went,
The blooms that flamed, the fruited tree
Whereof our lips were innocent.
Down gleaming vistas flushed with gold
We wandered on enchanted feet —
Ah ! twining arms too weak to hold,
How fine the sacrifice, how sweet !
I dream to-night of hot farewells,
Of hotter tears and words of wail—
Frail voices haunt the windy swells
Beyond the foam, the heaving sail;
Beyond the eyes’ eternal gaze,
The yearning heart’s incessant cries,
White-souled, she walks your lonely ways,
Since Fate was hard, 0, Starry Eyes !
I dream, I dream of purer heights,
Where we may rove and love alwav.
For ever where the Golden Lights
Drown all the world in’dawnless day.
Then, then the crush of burnished lips,
The deathless life so brief before —
Hist! Thro’ a whirl of strange eclipse
She calls me and I dream no more.
Q.
O. L. RIVERS.
The Wild Beast Boat.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I TELL you a ship vas a horrible thing; id is
sometimes a dead-house und a prison. De sea vas
a big salt devil dot rolls its back und drowns men
in de night.”
Sven Christensen is of the Viking breed. He
lives with the Dago fishermen in a hut overlooking
the harbor. In a far corner of the stuffy apart-
ment one sees a copper blubber-pan resting on the
snout of an old diving helmet. Sven has learnd
all the sea trades ; the harpoon and the trawling
net are the symbols of his craft. There is a light
in his eye that comes only to those who have
heard the icebergs crash and split around the
capes of No Man’s Land. The dried blood of a
bull-seal is still on his leggings.
A bruised tramp limps to her moorings beyond
Pinchgut. Sven notes for a moment her crushed
bulwarks and her broken mainyard that leans like
a crucifix against the sky. “Der men on dot
leedle ship are cut und hurt, mein friendt. Dey
are cursin’ one anoder now, und der vas a sour
taste in der Cap’n’s mouth from want of sleep.
Poor leedle ship.” Sven sat on an overturned
fish-basket and cut some sweet-smelling tobacco
from its oakum bandage.
“I vas in a sea-menagerie once. I travelled
mit Ilagenbeck’s agent und Casanova. I go to
der Sabi River und Senegal. Yah, I haf seen sun-
up on der edge of Sahara. Got dam ! you beoble
know nodings. Hagenbeck’s man und me crossed
Stanley mit our waggons—he vas after Emin
Bey’s ivory. Stanley would not palaver mit us;
he vas in a hurry. De explorer who dreams of
ivory vas always in a hurry.
“Der wet jungle mit a man-beast in every tree
is not so bad as der South Pole, mein friendt.
Down dere de cold slams in your face like ham-
mers.' You hear de earth svingin’ round und
round* But let me tell you about der menagerie-
agent und Cap’n Jago, der Spaniard.
“It vas in Upper Nubia dot Casanova intro-
duce us to der Hamran Arabs who do business
mit der Hamburg dealer. We haf coffee mit der
chief, und a day later I see dem trap a black-
maned lion mit a drop.-net in der hollow of some
rocks. He roar at night—by Got, it vas like
Niagara. He lash and fight between der ropes;
his red eyes vas blind mit pain und rage. Noding
could stand against such a beast; his strength vas
horrible. Mit a touoh of his paw he opened a
Nubian from shoulder to heel. He vas from der
back of Sahara; der vas sand in his mane, und
spear marks like der gridiron on his ribs. Dese
hungry beasts shift sometimes from der Nile into
Zululand. He kill dree of our servants before we
get him to der port of Zeila in Somaliland.
“Der beast-boat King Sancho await us. I
nefar see such a ship. She haf der sea-rot in her
planks, und her owners haf not der decency to
cover der carven Christ-head on her bow.
“ Cap’n Jago vas on der bridge; he vas der thin
Spaniard dot spit at niggers und bully der cook.
‘Dios!’ he screams to us. ‘Hurry aboard mit
dose dam lions.’ I did not like Cap’n Jago. He
haf been in der wild beast trade too long. His
ship haf all de animal smells of Africa between
her decks. I taste hyena und wolf in der Irish
stew he gif us for breakfast.
“I took ‘Elephant’ Jack, a Basuto keeper,
aboard to look after der beasts—panthers, zebra,
der black she-leopard, und der monkeys. We put
de lion for’ard. Der vas a box aboard, big as a
cottage, to hold a boa-constrictor der agent buy
at Stanley Falls. It haf a body like a horse, und
I tink to meinself dot its house should haf been
lined mit steel instead of blankets. I breathe der
sickly snake-smell in der hot night. It vas worse
dan old whale.
“Jago take a great fancy to de lion. He sit
pefore de cage in a deck-chair talkin’ child-non-
sense to de beast. De lion sit quiet und look at
Jago. One day, when he was full of brandy, Jago
put his silly hand on de slide-bar. De beast vas
rollin’ on his side, but from under his eyelid he
see de hand, und his paw came down mit a slash
dot shook de fo’c’s’le. Jago ran back gigglin’ like
a fool.
“We haf a pen of live sheep aboard, but de
jungle beasts did not relish dem cold. De lion
pine for de hot blood. He vas a man-killer—by
der old knife-wounds under his belly it showed
dat a few had died between his paws.
M We meet bad weather for a time, und der
King Sancho roll like a sow in slush. One morn-
in’ I hear someding go clickerty-click in der
engine-room ; de next day it go croak, croak, like
a frog. Den at dinner we feel a jar, und someding
go tearing troo de ship like a broken vindow. Der
ship swing round mid her heels to der weather,
und stop dead.
“ Riley, de chief engineer, come on deck wipin’
his face. ‘We haf a broken leg/ he says to Gaffey,
de second officer. ‘Den, be gob/ says Gaffey,
‘our oder leg is in de grave/
“Riley cursed und laughed ; den he and Gaffey
go below to celebrate de joke mit whisky. Dot
is der way mit Liverpool Irishmen ; dey laugh
because dey hate to build up anyting dot breaks.
Und der sea drowns dem in her time.
“ After a while, Cap’n Jago go below in a fury.
Den we hear Riley’s laugh, und Gaffey’s laugh ;
den Jago laugh while dey mix whisky. Und
der King Sancho roll her scrap-iron plates in de
green water while Gaffey sing a song about Kil-
larney. Dey could not repair de broken cylinder,
but Riley go tinkerin’ about mit a screw-wrench
while Gaffey do a cake-walk on de plates.
“ De night come up like a hot black shawl from
de equator. Der vas no vind now ; der smell of
der beasts stayed sour in our throats. By Got! it
vas hot. I look in to de leopard’s cage und see
her on her side in a pool of sweat.. All de beasts
lie still except der hyaena; I tink dey vas all
listenin’ to der s’r’r’r’p und whish-whish of der
sharks tearin’ round de ship.
“‘For Chris’ sake!’ I shout to de Basuto,
“help me trow lime on de deck.’ Susu, de monkey,
call to me as I pass her cage. I stop und go to de
water cask und give her a drink because she haf a
leedle baby in her arms. Her cage vas opposite
de leopard’s. De leopard watch her all day und
night mit its yellow eyes until Susu go sick. Den
I shift de monkey-cage round, but de leedle fool
Susu haf to peep troo de back boards because de
leopard’s eye vas callin’ her. ‘ You shall not die
like dot, little womans,’ I say, und I took her und
her baby to my cabin.
“Der vas no wind next day. A zebra und
panther die, und de sharks fight round us in
thousands. De heat below vas like a tiger’s
mouth. Riley vas filin’ de cylinder. He put up
his hand quick und say, ‘By Got, I can taste a
full-grown lion in my mouth. It make me un-
well.’ Und he go below to his bunk. Tree hours
after, he vas dead. Den de Basuto keeper com-
plain about de wild-beast taste in his mouth.
After dinner, he get swellin’s about de body, und
he vas dead at sundown.
“ ‘We haf plague/ I said to Gaffey. ‘Faith,’
he says, ‘l’m glad to hear it. We shall not haf
measles. Plague und measles never strike a ship
together.’ We buried him at midnight.
“ In der moonlight, I go on deck und see Cap’n
Jago sittin’ before de lion’s cage mit a brandy
bottle in his hand. I say nodin’, but I call a
sailor to help me trow a dead panther overboard.
Dat night, when de moon set behind der riggin’,
de lion get up in his cage und roar undil der ship
tremble.
“Next day, de firemen die in twos und trees.
De cook und carpenter go over. ‘By Got, ’ I say
to meinself, ‘if dis goes on, I shall be left alone
mit Jago und de lion.’
“Den de sky change, und a squall hit _us at
midday, und der water flew over der hurricane-
deck, and de wind tore away our top hamper. I
heard de lion move under de tarpaulin, sniffin’
like a cat mit salt in its eyes. Jago drank brandy
all de time.
“ De noise of der man-eatin’ lion und der sight
of Jago make me bad-tempered. Der vas no-one
left to speak to but Susu, de monkey. De boa-
constrictor vas in de big case, but no man vants
de boa for a friend.
“We go short ov mea,t. All de sheep die, und
de lion make horrible noises. * Gif it dot monkey
of yours/ says Jago to me. ‘ Come to my cabin,
Jago,’ I said, ‘und I vill kick your chest in/
“ Jago screamed at me, und run about de deck
like mad. ‘ Dios !’ he shouted, ‘de monkey make
good lion-meat. De lion vill starve. It vas worth
a thousand dollaire. ’ I say no more, because I
think he vas mad; der plague und der break-
down turn his brain.
“I went below und gif Susu a biscuit und
some nuts I haf in my locker. By midnight I vas
asleep ondil someding pull my hair. ‘ What’s de
matter? ’ I shout, sittin’ up m my bunk. Den I
see Susu, de monkey, chatterin’ near my head.
She vas very frikened. She hold de baby close
to her und shiver. Someding vas wrong on deck/
I say.
“It vas moonlight above. I heard Jago on de
Eoop screamin’ for me to come up. ‘ Coom up
ere, you pig German, und fight me/ he says.
“ ‘I tink you vas drunk und mad, Jago/ I said,
und I move up de stairs slow, because Susu vas
cryin’ to me from de bunk. ‘ Alride, leedle
womans/ I say, ‘Sven can look out for himself.’
Shoosb as I speak de shadow of de lion fell on de
bulwark,
“‘Jago, you hell-fool/ I shouted; ‘why did
you let out de lion, you dam meddler !’
Jago on the bridge screamed mit laughter. He
vas drinkin’, because I heard de bottle clink
against de rail. I stepped to de foot of de com-
panion an’ looked up again. De man-eater was
standin’ on de top of his cage mid his head
towards Senegal. By his ribs I see dot he vas
hungry, but de sea frikened him a leedle. Den he
sprang to the deck like a big dog und roared mid
his head to de moon.
“Jago called me bad names from de bridge.
He insult my fader und my moder, und trow de
empty brandy bottle down de stairs at me.
“' We vas prisoners down here, Susu,’ I say to
de monkey. ‘We vas in a trap. I cannot fight
a lion mit bare hands. I tink it vas all up.’ I
closed de cabin door, for I thought de beast might
sniff us out, und if he get in one of his paws at de
door ten men could not close it again ondil Leo
get someding in his mouth. He vas sniffin’ round
de deck ; I heard de pad of his feet along de alley-
way. ‘He vill tear down de ship for food by-und-
bye/ I said. Susu hold her baby und stare into
my face. She knew de ways of de lion.
“In de mornin’ a thought came to me, und I
creep to de head of de stair to de back of de boa-
constrictor’s house. Der vas no chance for me,
und if Jago heave lions at me der vas no reason
why I should not heave someding at Jago.
“De lion vas standin’in der empty sheep-pen
watchin’ Jago on de bridge. Jago had shut him-
self in the wheel-house; he vas half sober now.
I see by the jerk of his long chin dat his knees vas
collidin’. He expected dot I would come on deck
shoost in time to meet Leo. He vas in a trap him-
self now.
“I took de butcher’s chopper from de cook-
house and hit de big snake’s box on de lock tree
times; de lid flew open und I slip below again,
saying all de prayers I could remember.
“Jago shake de wheel-house door und scream
curses at me. ‘You haf been drinkin’, Cap’n/I
shout back, ‘ und what you will see presently will
not be real, it will only be de horrors. Go to
shleep/ I said.
“ Again I peep up de stair because I tink de
boa vas a long time get tin’ out. I took de cook’s
bucket und pitched it into de box. Dot vas
enough. Der big, flat, wicked head came up mit
a sweep; it make a noise in its trote like de train
slidin’ down a hill. Den I began to see by de
slow way it got out of its bed dot it was a female
boa. It did not hurry; its trote moved like a
bellows, und it slipped to de deck mit a fleshy
sound dot make leedle Susu whimper mit fear.
“De lion mit his head by Senegal whipped
round at de rattlin’ noise, as though someones had
sthruck him mit a hot bar. De jungle beasts do
not like de boa; de leopard vill run from its break-
fast when it come by; de panther und tiger reckon
dey haf business up de river when de constrictor’s
head sweeps troo de reeds. Der lion is not always
brave, but he is sometimes ashamed to run away;
peobles haf been tellin’ him dot he haf a reputa-
tion to sustain.
“For meinself I gif not a damn which way de
fight go. It vas a goner mit me on de plague-ship,
und I tink a good beast-fight would cheer me up
before I die. Der vas no sound but de creakin’ of
der yards; der tropic sun stream down like hot
rain. De ship lie mit her nose to de east like a
thing about to die.
“Jago leaned across de bridge mit der face
of a dead man. ‘Why did you let out dot
creepin’ horror?’ he whisper to me. ‘En nombre
de Dios ! —why did you let it out ? ’
“I had no eyes for Jago, for de lion make up
his mind about de fight; he came troo de air mit
a roar, but de boa shift her head like a whip-lash,
und de lion dropped on de hatch like a mongrel
dot haf been kicked.
“De boa did not seem in a hurry to start de
fight. Its skin was ribbed und barred, und it
sweep round mit its head up like a woman in a
ballroom.
“De lion lie mit his chin to de deok; de sweat
drops from his flank; he wanted to trek, but
der vas no sand-hummock to hide pehind, no
cane-grass to sneak into. Der constrictor swing
by und stoop to him shoost as a woman reaches
for an apple. Leo roared und smote mit his paw,
but she hit him like lightnin’ between de eyes.
Den I see a leedle jungle-play; de lion was afraid
to spring because he know she would grip him by
de waist; he hit, hit at her swingin’ head, he
creep low und try to fasten her by de neck, but
she was so quick dot de eye could not follow. She
hit him on the eyes und chest, den she get him
neck and mane und fling him into de scuppers. A
lion is beat when he is thrown. De constrictor
gife him no time to feel sorry; she lift und drag
him across de deck while he fill de ship mit
mongrel howls. Und she make no fuss, dis gar-
rotter of de jungle ; she smash him against de
mast until he vas blind and silly.
“I creeped on deck in my bare feet. I saw my
chance to get away. I ran to de store-room und
carry out some biscuit und provision. I placed de
cask oi water from de galley into a boat,
but it vas devil’s work lowerin’ from de
davit by meinself. I pull round by de
ship’s head und someding scream at me
from de bo’sprit. I look up und see Susu
mit her baby monkey callin’ me. I rowed under,
und threw a lamp halyard across de figurehead,
‘ Come und chance it mit me, Susu,’ I said. ‘ You
will haf no chance mit de constrictor; it will
follow you troo de riggin’ up to de masthead to
get your baby.’ Susu seemed to onderstand, for
she come down de halyard like a seaman. De
baby monkey cried when it see de water so close.
‘Hush, you leedle fool,’ I said. ‘Yourmoder
und me know what is best.’
“ Und so I left de plague-ship, while Jago ran
up und down de bridge, callin’ me bad names. I
had some canvas in de boat, und I steer her nor’-
nor’-west for de Grand Canary. On de fifth
mornin’ a wool-ship came stridin’ across the
Equator und gif us a lift.
“It happened years ago, but when I get mad
mit wine I see de best sight of all—Jago barri-
caded in de wheel-house und de boa stretched on
de bridge outside, waitin’ for him to come out.”

me&r our place who was twisting his neck and ;
gesticulating in front of a gum-tree. I walked!
home and told dad, and he went to have a look at:
him. Found him dead, choked with a piece of
dry corned beef. He was choking on his feet;
when I passed. It made an impression on me'
because my priest said “ he wasn’t in a fit state to
die,” and I thought his soul might feel a bit
annoyed with me for not coming to the rescue.
A few years back I saw a man doing the same
throat-stretching act in a restaurant, and thinking
he might also be unfit to die, I rushed him and
hit him eight times on the back before he could
stop me. I held my own reasonably well in the
fight that ensued, and when the staff tore us apart
I got a chance to explain. And then it proved
that his only trouble was a stiff neck.
THE KIDNEYS:
WHERE THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY DO.
As the kidneys have more work to
do than any organ of the body, it is
important to know where they are,
what they are, and what they do.
The picture shows where the kid-
neys are—in the small of the back.
That is why the back aches when
there is kidney trouble.
What are the kidneys ?—They are
two bean-shaped organs, made up of
thousands of small cells and fine mem-
branes. They are the most delicate
organs of the body. When the kid-
neys are weak, the least cold or chill
affects their action.
What the kidneys do.—They filter
the blood—every drop of our blood
goes to the kidneys to be filtered and
purified. When they are well the
kidneys take out nearly five hundred
grains of impure matter every twenty-
four hours.
When the kidneys are sick every
organ goes wrong, because sick kid-
neys cannot filter the blood properly.
Poisons and impurities are left in,
and these cause headaches, backaches,
limb aches, fluttering of the heart,
dropsy, and rheumatism. There will
be a too great or too little flow of the
urine, with gravel or sediment; you
will feel always tired, done up, ner-
vous, and restless.
Doan’s backache Kidney Pills are
the great kidney and bladder cure.
They go to the root of the whole
trouble, and greatly relieve, heal, and
regulate the kidneys. They freshen
you up, because they rid the body of
KlON^yj
its accumulated impurities through the kidneys.
To one with kidney or bladder trouble, wnose kidneys and whole system
are clogged with impurities, there can be no relief equal to that aiiorded
by this great kidney medicine.
fjiai’s Backache Kidney pills
But do not be satisfied with our word for tills 3
Read what our fellow townspeople say:
Mr. William Greenland, printer, 22 Forsyth-street. Glebe, says: "I
have suffered from backache and kidney trouble. The backache was a heavy
pain in the small of my back, in the vicinity of the kidneys. It caused me
both pain and inconvenience as it affected my movements to a great degree.
My secretions were very much disordered and contained a great amount of
sediment. I procured a supply of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills and having
used them T am pleased to say that they have completely removed the back-
ache, and put my kidneys in a healthy state. Although I used a number of
medicines before I got Doan's Pills it was only this remedy that proved good
for my trouble. I know others who have tried them and think as much of the
pills as I do.”
If every cold or chill affects the back and kidneys; if spirits, beer, or tea
excite the kidneys, or if you have any of the symptoms given above, Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills will relieve and cure you. They do not act on the
bowels, but only on the kidneys and bladder, and can, therefore, be taken
whenever and as often as necessary, without interfering with your daily
work. It dissolves the gravel and uric acid, and carries them and all other
poisons out through the kidneys, giving the patient prompt and lasting relief.
DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS
are for sale by all Chemists and Storekeepers at 2s. 9d. per box (six boxes,
15s. 3d.), or will be posted, on receipt of price, by Foster-McClellan Co., 76
Pitt-street, Sydney.
BUT BE SURE THEY ARE DOAN’S.
Itchiness of the Skin,
Ever have any irritation of the skin ? There
are many forms of it, any of them bad enough
to tax your patience. Haemorrhoid, a plague
of the night—no rest for the sufferer from that
complaint. Eczema, too. Hives don’t sound
dangerous, but they cause much misery to
those unfortunate enough to be troubled with
them. Doan’s Ointment is “a wonder” for
any such trouble. No troublesome irritation
of the skin can resist its healing, soothing
influence. Lots of Sydney people know this
now.
Mrs. Silva, AG Duke-street Woolloomooloo,
says : “ A year or two ago I informed you of
the immense benefit I derived from the use of
Doan’s Ointment. My little girl had a skin
trouble which affected the leg. It was not
unlike ringworm, only a lot more spread out.
It was so irritable that she scratched it until
it became raw. We applied a lot of ointments
at times, but they did not seem to benefit it.
When I made the statement which has
appeared in the Sydney papers, Doan s Oint-
ment hadn’t quite cured her, but had done her
awonderful lot of good. I gave that testimonial
for the marvellous way this Ointment used to
bring ease, but since then the Ointment cured
it thoroughly. We used two pots, and she has
been free of the rash over twelve months now.
We think the world of Doan’s Ointment.”
Doan’s Ointment is splendid in all diseases
of the skin, eczema, piles, hives, sojes, insect
bites, chilblains, etc. It is perfectly safe and
very effective. Very often two or three pots
have cured chronic cases which have resisted
other remedies for years.
Doan’s Ointment is sold by all chemists and
storekeepers at 2s. 9d. per pot, or will be
posted on receipt of price by Foster-
McClellan Co., 76 Pitt-st., Sydney.
But be sure you get DOAN’S.
Down in Riverina.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Down in pleasant Riverina ! In my fanoies and
my dreams
I can see that land of laughter, with its valleyß
and its streams j
I can see it decked with silver in the silent
summer noon,
And I picture all its glories as it slumbers ’nsath
the moon j
For I’ve lived in narrow cities, and I’ve found
that life is vain
Ah ! I’m longing, Riverina, for your laughing
land again.
Down in sunny Riverina, where the skies are
bright and blue,
Where the men are always striving, and the maids
are sweet and true,
Where the daylight breaks in splendor, and the
sunlights dream all day,
Where the breezes drone their stories, and the
rippling waters play,
Where the nights are black and silver, and the
days are gold and green—
Where one’s life is worth the living—down in
sleepy Riverine.
Down in dreaming Riverina, where my old bush
sweethearts are,
Where my early loves lie hidden in the distance,
faint and far,
Where soft eyes are lit with laughter, and sweet,
loving voices call
(And I’ll love their owners truly, or I’ll never love
at all!).
I know city girls in plenty, but they never can
compare
With the girls of Riverina, for my dearest ones
are there.
Down in old-time Riverina, where my home of
boyhood lies
In that valley where the ridges to the westward
roll and rise,
Where the sunbeams keep their vigils, and the
stars the night long shine
O’er the graves of those whose mem’ries are so
dear to me and mine—
When my hopeless quest is over in the.e hopeless
lands I roam,
I will claim you, Riverina, as my last, eternal
home.
Down in far-off Riverina, where I fashioned as
a child
Rainbow dreams that I have followed with a
longing almost wild,
Where my people proudly saw me take my des-
tined path—and yet
I have followed, vainly followed, with an aching,
vague regret;
But they speak my name with sorrow and, per-
chance, a touch of pride
Down in slumbrous Riverina, far away from
Sydney-side.
Down in leafy Riverina—how ray fevered fancy
flies
To that land of happy meetings, days of bliss, and
sad good-byes—
Ah, my old, wild, reckless bushmen—faithful
comrades of my heart—
Though our ways have differed widely and we’ve
drifted far apart,
Yet I’m longing for a meeting, when my wild,
mad dreams are past,
Down in fertile Riverina, when her sons return at
last.
Lotus land of Riverina! I have learned what
men endure—
I have feasted with the wealthy, and I’ve fasted
with the poor ;
I have walked the splendid highways wl ere the
pulseless hearts are cold,
Till I weary of the city with its glory and its
gold.
And I’d sooner be a rover with a load of want
and woe
Down in sleepy Riverina, where the dear old
rivers flow.
Far away from Riverina ! Let my fancies faint-
and fade—
I have sampled life in earnest in the sunlight and
the shade.
Let the traffic roar and rattle, let the holy church-
bells ring
(Ah, they only chime to mock me in the twilight
of my fling !);
Let me flee the Bin and squalor till I set my feet
again
Down in dreamy Riverina, far from mockery and
pain.
Down in God’s own Riverina! lam far away,
but clear
Are the scenes that rise before me in my narrow
office here.
How the weary, woeful city in its fever moans
aloud!
How the passing people haunt me! How the
ghastly faces crowd!
And there’s little left to cheer me, and there’s
nothing left to thrill—
Yes, my native Riverina, I am loyal to you still l

GILROONEY.
The End of a Drama.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Thk woman lay back in her chair before the fire
the man leant against the mantelpiece, looking
down at her.
“ You admit you love me ? ”
“ I admit nothing.”
“I am going to make you admit it. Listen—
I love you; you will marry me.”
The woman hid her face again in the cushion.
“ I loved you through all those years, and you
knew it—and you were glad of it. You knew
that if it came to the worst —I was there. You
knew, although you were married to him, that in
your soul—you were my wife.”
A little gasp from the pillow.
“ Yes, I was there always, watching. Did I
not see how, when he showered his coarse kisses
on you, you would shrink, and the red would
mount up your throat, and you would turn
to me, but you could not raise your face
to mine—with the shame of it all. Shame !
because it was his caress ; shame that 1 should see
it. Oh, my dear, I sometimes think that if I
had held out my arms to you, you would have
come to them; but I held back that I might not
hurt your innocence. Was I right ? Was I wrong ?
I can’t say, even now. You would have always
been for me as pure as now, now when he is dead ;
but, for the rest of the world ! Perhaps it is best
as it is. We should have suffered so much, not
for ourselves perhaps, but for each other. Oh,
my darling, my heart used almost to choke me
with the agony —the tragedy of it all. I loved
you so much; and at night when I was alone, I
used to lie awake and make a temple out of the
darkness and place you in it, and kneel to you,
and kiss your little white feet, and ”
“ Oh ! don’t, don’t ”
“ But I must. Be quick ! tell me. What is it ?
What, it’s not ” —the firelight flashed on the
woman’s face—“ you’re not —you’re not afraid of
me?”
The woman’s face was still in the pillow. His
throat was full; he turned to go. A little hand
was on his sleeve, and a broken little smile touohed
the woman’s mouth.
“ It’s—it’s not that.”
“ What is it then ?” He watched her steadily.
“It’s —it’s”—the firelight caught the red flush
on her throat—“it’s as you say—the shame of it
all!”
The man’s arms went out to her, and pity lay
on his faoe like mother-love. “My little one ! ”
“No, no; it’s best that it should die out.
Those years have killed the heart in me. What
am I now ? A woman, weary—tired out; whose
very love, perhaps, would be only a petty exac-
tion. No, I will not marry you. Those years
would haunt us. A woman always sacrifices her
girlhood in homage to her love —she has only one
girlhood, and the memory of that first love. I
did love him ! ”
“You did not. You created an ideal, and
watched and waited until you found a representa-
tive for your ideal. Then, you made a god of
him, and, after a time, the paint wore off your
idol, and you saw the hollow wood beneath. Then
you loved me, and now, do you hear—now, you
will marry me.”
“I will not.”
“You will.”
“ I will not. Wait.”
She pressed her handkerchief nervously to her
mouth, then —“My friend, in the name of all that
love, which you have given me, I ask you to go.
Think ; am I the woman to sit here and play off
a little comedy of coyness, to satisfy my vanity.
Be just; admit that I am above that pettiness.
lam too old, and have felt too much. Ah, for
your own sake, for mine—go quickly ! ”
A moment, and the man raised his face from
the mantelpiece.
“ I can’t.’’
There was a little sick sob from the woman, as
her head fell back on the cushion.
“I can’t. I have waited five years, and now—
Stay ! Give me the reason, and if it is right—if it
is just—if it will make you happier—l will go.”
She leant forward. “ Promise ! ”
“ I promise.”
“Oh, it will hurt you so much, and yet”—the
handkerchief went to her mouth again—“you
were right just now, when you said I loved you.
At that time, I did—l loved you with passionate
adoration. You were the last dream of the
woman who had suffered and was disillusioned.
You were my religion. You were young, strong,
firm, and above the level of other men, and I
dreamt that according to your greatness, so would
be your reward. I pictured to myself a time
when I should stand beside you, directing your
talents, spurring your energy, good comrade in
your conquests. And then—oh, how shall I tell it
to you, and yet, ah, how very human it was !
When I think of him ? my soul loathes my body—l
feel even now the stain of his kiss upon my mouth. ]
Every time I felt his breath upon my cheek it al-;
most strangled me —if he took me in his arms it'
left me numb and sick with disgust—and you
looked on, and when I turned to you, faint with
the wound in my soul, you never held out an arm •
to shelter me. At each insult he offered me I
watched your lips, waiting for them to say
‘Come,’ and they never moved. Your self-
restraint was admirable, your endurance Christ-
like ; but, your manliness ? If you only had been a
little weaker, a little more human —oh, my friend, ’
pardon ! I have been cruel, I have hurt you too'
much.” !
The man was very white.
“My dear, it is you who must pardon. I wor-
shipped your innocence, but I—l forgot that you
were human, too. But, my little one—his voice
was yearning, very tender—“there is still time;
let me expiate.” _ ;
“ Stop ! There is—there is not time. It—it!
wouldn’t be worth while now, dear. Look ! ” i
The handkerchief dropped from her mouth andi
spread its blood-stain between them both.

A
Mrs. John Evans, of Subiaco,
West Australia, sends this Pho-
tograph of herself and children,
and says:
“ Whenever any member of
my family becomes pale, weak,
debilitated, or suffers from im-
pure blood, I always fall back on
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla and Ayer’s
Pills. I give the Pills to keep
the bowels all right and the
Sarsaparilla to make the blood
pure and strengthen the nerves.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla carried my
husband through a bad attack
of influenza, and later it also
cured him of rheumatism. I
have often given it to my chil-
dren when they have lost their
appetite and become listless. I
practise as a nurse, and fre-
quently recommend Ayer’sSarsaparillaforthe very tryingclimate of this country.
And I can truthfully say that both nurse and patient are always greatly pleased. ’ ’
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
This testimonial should convince every one who reads it of the great value
of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla as a blood-purifier and general tonic. Mrs. Evans
speaks as a mother, ever watchful over the health of those most dear to her.
She also speaks as a professional nurse, one who knows just what effect these
medicines have on those who are suffering.
Be sure you get Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. There are a great many substitute
Sarsaparillas on the market that will disappoint you. Avoid imitations.

,“ J-A.C.": More re David Miranda, father of the
charming Lalla. He was really a very excellent teacher
“ and, besides teaching his daughter pretty well
all she knows, before her departure for Europe, had
amongst his pupils John Forde and his sister Anna,
Lharles Taylor, E. Farley, Charles Templeton (father of
nempriere Pringle), and many others who made successes
m opera, both serious and comic.
_‘D.”: That man who designs all the posters for the
second-class dramas must be very old. When I was a boy
they were just the same. Same old villain, same heroine,
same “worst woman,” revolvers, daggers, streak of
lightning—all the same. Sometimes I go out and look
at the posters, and they make me feel voung. And the
dramas are the same. When I want to unship 35 years of
trouble I go up into the gallery, whistle at the villain,
cheer Walter Baker, and come away inclined to play leap-
frog or “ fly-the-garter.”
The Salvarmy is becoming a formidable rival to travel-
ling shows in the country and suburban routes of the
Commonwealth. The following Salvo companies, on

Crusaders (Victoria); Tasmanian Serenaders (Tasmania) ;
Quintette of Story-tellers (S.A.); “ Special Tours,” S.A.
and N.S.W. These are all “ Special ” companies, which
have their organised agents, in the local officers, at every
town they visit. The units of the co.’s are billetted, free
of expense, on “the faithful”; have the local barracks
free of charge, or the local theatre at reduced rent, and
sell their tickets* from door to door weeks before the
event, which generally has a pork-pie or a sausage roll
and cup o’ coffee to finish up with—victuals supplied by
the lofcal adherents. And as the mummer who lives on
the game can’t-get the parson to sell tickets for him or
throw in cadged refreshments.as a special attraction
well, where is he ?
■ “ Top ” : The late Maggie Stewart was a splendid exam-
ple of the purely mechanical actress. She had a present-
able stage figure, with a faint stereotyped smile, and
could dance and sing. Her most notable appearance was
in Akhurst’s burlesque, “The Siege of Troy,” at Melb.
Royal, 35 years ago, when Marian Dunne and Docy
Stewart sustained the leading parts with great success.
Maggie used to take up the same positions on the stage
with mathematical accuracy to the eighth of an inch
every night. The end of a pirouette always found her
on the same crack of the boards. Macready, who was
wont to chalk crosses on the stage for his actors to stand
on, would have been delighted with her.
Another injustice. A dramatic company touring Mel-
bourne suburbs celebrated the Emmet centenary by pro-
ducing a play with Robert Emmet as the hero. Its
posters displayed as “ the young Irish patriot ” a litho-
graph of Salvarmy General Booth.
*' J.A.O.” : In Bulletin (l/10/’O3), “F.” asks "Why
doesn’t Ada Orossley give more ' sacred ’ songs ? A con-
tralto voice should never try to trivol or to be passionate.”
If “ F.” means to convey that the rich tones of a good con-
tralto voice lend themselves to the expression of solemn
sentiments he may, to a certain extent, be right; other-
wise, he is wide of the mark. The suggestion that
contraltos should avoid passionate music may be
dismissed as too self-evident a fallacy to call for
comment. Re the “ frivolous ” aspect of the ques-
tion. A great deal of “ frivolous ” music has been
written for contralto voices; that of Rosina in Rossini’s
“ Barber,” for instance, although usually sung with
transpositions by light sopranos, is contraito or mezzo-
soprano ; the same composer’s “ Ceuerentola ” (" Cinde-
rella”) is contralto pure and simple; and the role of
Arsace in “ Semiramide ” is, if not exactly frivolous,
exceptionally brilliant. I name one composer only,
and I leave opera bouffe out of the question altogether.
The only voice which never “frivols” is the true
dramatic soprano—the “Norma” and “ Lucrezia Borgia”
class. The tenor, also, is generally a to-be-taken-seriously
and much-stage-ill-used person, although there are serio-
comic tenor parts in such operas as “ Dinorah,” “ L’Elisir
d’Amore,” “ La Figlia del Reggimento,” &c., and excep-
tionally brilliant parts, such as Almaviva in the “ Barber.”
By “ brilliant ” I mean what is termed in Italian “ musica
brillante,’’ or "di fioretura.” On the other hand, baritones
and basses are often very gay dogs indeed—witness Don
Giovanni and Leporello—thus showing that heaviness of
timbre in voices is by no means an evidence of solemnity.
Much so-called “sacred” music would, if divested of its
surroundings, appear to the lay mind as fairly lively.
Zingarelli’s “ Laudate ” would make an excellent cake-
walk. After all, what is “sacred” music? It is merely
music allied to devotional sentiments, and, in itself, is as
sacred as an open letter by John Norton. I have heard
“ Consider the Lilies,” by accelerating the tempo, played
as an American sand-jig; and I knew a church organist
in Dunedin (M.L.) who, by altering the time and rhythm,
transformed “ I am the Captain of the Pinafore ” into a
voluntary. But probably “F.” was only joking, and
knows all about it as well as I imagine I do.
George Musgrove told a Perth (W.A.) interviewer that,
when he went to Maoriland to arrange for Edward Lloyd’s
tour, about the first newspaper man he met asked if
Lloyd was a brother of Marie Lloyd. Taking this horse
reporter’s query as a sample of local culture, George ex-
claimed, “ That settles it; Lloyd does not sing here,”
shook the dust off his feet, and gat him back to the
Commonwealth.
“Cockaigne” : Sere and yellow Jack Billington, who
was in Australia with Toole, is hard up, and to be mon-
ster-benefited. Thespians should be always nervous
about getting barnacled on to any star—the public seems
to have no use for the barnacle when the ship is gone.
Toole’s people seem all to have gone under. If you are
travelling with a Wilson Barrett, you watch his sick
nose. Thornton advised all hands to insure his life (but,
of course, they wouldn’t). Cathcart successively froze
on to Kean and Sullivan, and then got frosty. Sothern
hated Buekstone’s “ pensioners,” as he called the fossil
performers who supported him at the London Hay-
market. They were old-established barnacles, with no
hope of finding a new ship tq cling to.
