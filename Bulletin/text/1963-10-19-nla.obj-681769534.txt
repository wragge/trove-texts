National Notebook
Days of wine . . .
Spring is the season for festivals, fetes
and Weeks Fashion Week, Wine
Week and so on. The Australian Wine
and Brandy Producers celebrated their
week with the usual talks, tastings, and
outings, including one at which a Miss
Jackie Johnston drank champagne at
50 mph on water skis, no doubt proving
something. For the ordinary drinker the
association provided more ordinary fare,
including a slogan contest on one Syd-
ney radio station to which more than
3000 responded in one week.
A friend of ours who saw some of the
entries reports that the standard was
good for a slogan contest, disproving
one entrant’s declaration, on the back
of a picture of Billy Graham, that “When
the wine goes in, the wit goes out.” It
did not compare with entries such as
“Wine is not dear but it is endearing.”
The contest indicated that the lunatic
fringe is smaller among
wine drinkers, or the radio
station’s listeners, or both.
Surprisingly few claimed
gay qualities for their
drink. One woman said,
“Wine is good, it goes to
your head, if you don’t
look out you’ll end in bed,” but
it could have been an innocent thought.
So could “Intelligent wives serve ex-
hausted husbands wine nightly,” while
other entries, “Wine increases normal
expectancy,” and “Never forget the in-
credible taste of Australian wines” were
probably well meant. One of the moderns
wrote, “Nothing excels instant wine,”
and an ancient scrawled, “What is
blongk, the best not the worest, I drink
Australian wine.”
Apart from those, the entries sug-
gested that many people still associate
terms such as “elegant” and “important
occasions” with their wine buying, al-
though it must have pleased the pro-
ducers to note that more than half the
entrants linked wine with cooking and
eating. Even “Wine is nice with ice”
from one writer was a fair indication of
current thinking about wine for the
people which makes us wonder all
the more about that girl skiing along
at 50 miles an hour and trying to drink
champagne under such unromantic con-
ditions. Perhaps it just proves that PR
is getting wetter and wetter.
Ask your family chemist
A lecturer in chemistry at the Queens-
land University, Dr R. M. Carman,
drew attention last week to what he
described as exploitation of the public
over the price of fluoride tablets. He
said in a letter to “The Courier-Mail”
that the profits must be astronomical and
at the expense of the wage-earner who
had “the health of his children’s teeth at
heart.”
Dr Carman pointed out that fluoride
tablets purchased from a pharmacist cost
Bs. 6d. per 100. But 250,000 tablets
could be made from a 500-gram bottle
of the highest purity sodium chloride
costing £2 10s. At Bs. 6d. a hundred,
this would give a return of £1062 retail.
Dr Carman made the pharmacist’s mark-
up 42,000 per cent to cover the cost of
filler, pill-punching, packaging, retailing,
and “profits.” He added that a man liv-
ing for 80 years required a total intake of
fluoride valued at only 6s. If his require-
ments were bought in pill form from a
pharmacist, he would spend £124 on this
same fluoride.
Following Dr Carman’s letter, Mr Pat
Hanlon (son of former Labor Premier
Ned Hanlon) asked in the
State Legislative Assembly
if the Prices Commissioner
would be instructed to in-
vestigate the “exploitation”
claim. The Labor and In-
dustry Minister (Mr Alex
Dewar) said, in effect:
u No.” Which, to say the least, was some-
what surprising.
When the Sydney Water Board
voted against adding fluoride to the
water supply, The Bulletin asked the
NSW Health Department whether it had
done a study on the cost or feasibility
of supplying fluoride tablets to school-
children, perhaps along the lines of im-
munisation and innoculations, so that
the teeth of those who had no objection
to fluoride and the rights of those who
had were equally protected. A spokes-
man for the department said that no
study had been done. Dr Carman’s fig-
ures may interest them.
Changing Matilda

Gerald Green arrived in Sydney with
an NBC team to make an hour-long docu-

(“The Heartless Light”), corruption in
Florida (“The Lotus Eaters”) and other
perennial US topics, also wrote “The
Last Angry Man”, about a doctor in

As he talked he became rapidly wound
up, New York style. “We’re not having
one of those men behind a desk telling
us about Australia. You know, the vene-
tian blinds bit. We’re letting the people
tell the story. As they talk we’ll show
what they’re talking about.

here, and the food is much better—
that’s why the people here are so big.

much more like British ones—they’re not

Talking of TV, Green agreed with
Serling that freedom was limited, but
said comment on current issues was pos-
sible he had just done a very out-
spoken documentary on the Negroes in
Washington. “Hollywood, however,
completely fails to show the American
scene. The Italians do films far better.
That’s why I prefer TV. In programmes

“Done Like a Dinner”
“TAONE like a well-cooked dinner”
was how Mr F. E. Chamber-
lain described himself as he left
NSW last week after the failure of
his attempt to push the NSW Gov-
ernment around on the question of
State Aid to independent schools.
It was the best news in Labor Party
politics for many years, and it car-
ries a peremptory moral for those
who wish to profit from it.
Since 1954, when the Labor split
carried Mr Chamberlain from ob-
scurity into his present prominence,
this Federal Secretary and Federal
President has arrogantly struck
down all Parliamentary Labor lead-
ers who nervously crossed his path.
The cost has been hopeless splits,
the defeat of Labor Governments in
all States except NSW and Tas-
mania, official preference for Com-
munists over Roman Catholics
all in the name of “democratic
socialism”. Some Parliamentary
leaders would occasionally timidly
criticise Mr Chamberlain and his
influence, but spring smartly back
into line when, with cold ferocity,
he snapped the word.
But Sydney, at long last, became
his Waterloo. He had commanded
ALP Federal Executive to prohibit
the NSW Government’s proposal to
give £2l per annum, subject to a
means test, to the parents of child-
ren in the senior classes of private
schools. With horse, foot and artil-
lery he prepared to march on Parlia-
ment House, Sydney, expecting the
same frightened capitulation he had
met from Parliamentary Labor
leaders in the rest of Australia, not
least from Mr A. Calwell.
But the NSW Labor leaders were
fortunately more than a match for
this Left-wing bully-boy and they
taught him a lesson he is not likely
to forget. They informed Mr Cham-
berlain and his interstate stooges
that if there was to be a uniform
Labor policy on education, it must
not be confined to NSW only, and
that Tasmanian Premier Reece must
be instructed to withdraw benefits
similar to those proposed in NSW,
that Queensland Labor leader
Duggan must be ordered to oppose
the benefits given to private schools
by the Nicklin Government, and
that Victorian Labor leader Stone-
ham must be ordered to oppose ex-
tensions of benefits now proposed
by the Bolte Government.
In other words they told Mr
Chamberlain that he must be pre-
pared not only to wreck the NSW
Government (which may not have
worried him) but Labor’s electoral
chances in all States and in the Com-
monwealth. After nearly ten years
of getting his own destructive way,
Mr Chamberlain got his come-
uppance.
When faced with real determi-
nation and real power Chamberlain
had to capitulate. For those who
want to clean up Victoria and
Queensland the moral is plain.
Picking Up the Pieces
TN the aftermath of the Indo-
A nesian-Malaysian dispute the
discomforting fact remains that
Indonesia still violently objects to
Malaysia. Whether Djakarta will
continue with the more dangerous
manifestations of confrontation may
depend, as much as anything, on
whether Kuala Lumpur continues
with its own confrontation policy.
It is hard to imagine anything quite
so provocative in the last fortnight
as the speeches of Tunku Abdul
Rahman towards the leader of
100,000,000 neighbors. In tone
and language they have gone far
beyond the normal reaction of a
man of pride or even that of an out-
raged national leader whose patience
has come to an end. Malaysia is
now established with the blessing
of the UN and the goodwill of
practically every country in the
world but it still has to live with its
giant unpredictable neighbor. Teas-
ing it from the temporary safety of
Britannia’s skirts may prove a very
dangerous and self-destructive ex-
ercise. Now surely is the time for
Malaysia and for this country to
treat Indonesia with firmness but
with respect. One of the dangers
of popular ill will is that it forces
political leaders and ill-informed
opinion-makers into rash positions.
This has been demonstrated in this
country already over Indonesia’s ill-
considered policy of economic con-
frontation with Malaysia. In the
first place although this policy will
undoubtedly hurt Indonesia it is
certainly going to hurt Malaysia
more than either Kuala Lumpur or
Whitehall are prepared to admit.
In the second place let those who get
public satisfaction out of the dis-
heartening spectacle of President
Soekarno as an economic master-
mind think carefully about the end
results.
It was widely predicted at the
time of Suez that Nasser’s illegal
seizure of the Canal would destroy
him and bring Egypt to economic
collapse.. Nothing of the sort hap-
pened and Nasser got help from
Russia. Nor will Indonesia collapse
merely to please those in this
country or in Malaysia who think
Indonesia’s disintegration would
provide a comfortable solution to
intractable problems. It would
merely complicate them. As one
of Indonesia’s nearest neighbors, our
policy should demand we are firm
in our own interests while unremit-
tingly working for a reconciliation
of Indonesia and Malaysia. This is
going to require patience and, above
all, tact.

CANBERRA
Calwell’s Strategy
for the Next Election
When Menzies goes?
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
ARTHUR CALWELL
“Get Holt”
A rthur Calwell has obviously
selected Harold Holt to play the
role of the conniving Harry in the elec-
tion drama. The first scenes have already
been played out and will continue to
attract a national audience until the
lights are turned out on polling night.
The lines along which Calwell’s mind
is working are fairly clear. The
Liberals believe that the only leadership
under which they can win the next
election is that provided by the present
Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies. If
they think that, then implicit in this is
an acknowledgement that they cannot
win if Holt replaces Menzies.
But Menzies will be 69 years of age
at the end of this year. Though 35
years of politics and 14 years con-
tinuously as Prime Minister have left
him remarkably unscarred physically he
has always said that he would like to
be out of politics when he was 70.
There have been recent indications that
he might live up to this long-held in-
tention.
How can Calwell exploit this situa-
tion to his own and Labor’s advantage?
It is no use Calwell pointing out
Menzies’ age and suggesting that this
is a liability. At 67 Calwell is only
two years younger.
So what Calwell is doing is shifting
the attack to Holt whom he considers
the weak link in the Liberal chain.
Calwell is not making a bad fist of the
attack. What he is reiterating to the
public is that there can be only two
reasons why Holt has been urgently
advising Menzies for months to seek
from the Governor-General a dissolu-
tion of the present House of Represent-
atives instead of deferring an election
until what would be the normal time to-
wards the end of next year.
As Calwell is putting it, reason (1) is
that Holt, who has had the responsibility
for guiding the Australian economy
since the former treasurer Sir Arthur
Fadden retired in 1959, is nervous about
his own handiwork. He can see financial
and economic conditions getting diffi-
cult in 1964. He might have to reimpose
financial restrictions similar to those he
imposed at the end of 1960 and which
came within two seats of turning the
liberal-CP Menzies Government out of
office at the 1961 elections. He wants
the elections safely behind him and the
assurance of another three years in
power when he has to take such un-
popular action.
Reason (2), according to Calwell, is
a personal one. Holt wants what Calwell
derisively describes as an “air cushion”
ride into the Prime Ministership. He
wants the Prime Ministership, but he
does not want to earn it; he wants to
succeed to it.
Actually there is something baffling
about the determination with which Holt
has been pressing for an election as
early as possible. As leader of the House
of Representatives and responsible for
getting through the Government’s
legislation. Holt, operating on the narrow
margins of a floor majority of one, has
had problems. But the basic fact is
that at no point was the Parliament un-
workable. The Government got through
every piece of legislation it put up.
(Labor gave Ministers pairs when they
needed to be absent on business of
national importance.) Why a position
that was tolerable and workable for two
years becomes intolerable and unwork-
able in the third year when there has
been no significant change in the posi-
tion itself is rather mystifyng.
Commonsense would seem to dictate
that the Government should have had
an electoral redistribution before it even
considered an election. It was entitled
to have a redistribution because of the
population shifts revealed by the census
held in 1961. These population shifts
are working in Labor’s favor. The inner
city Labor strongholds are becoming
smaller as their inhabitants shift out-
wards. This does not weaken them as
Labor strongholds, but it weakens the
more marginal seats in the city’s outer
suburbs which are Liberal-held. A re-
distribution would have made an election
less of a gamble for the Liberals but Holt
seems quite happy to gamble.
Against this rather baffling back-
ground, one can see why Calwell, de-
liberately and with considerable shrewd-
ness, has selected Holt rather than
Menzies as the political villain of the
present election play. If he can establish
in the public mind that the choice is
between himself and Holt as the next
Prime Minister rather than between
himself and Menzies, he will to some
degree have lessened the electoral value
to the Liberals of Menzies’ undoubted
prestige. He will also have planted the
suspicion that Holt is unsure about the
results of his handiwork —the Australian
economy—in the year ahead.
NEWSPAPERS
Kennelly Reforms the Press
Too many British and American correspondents
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
Oenator Pat (“The Kingmaker”) Ken-
nelly, with Australian-Irish fervor,
has feuded happily with the Press for
years.
But in a recent Chifley Memorial Lec-
ture to the Melbourne University ALP
Club entitled “Labor and the Mass
Media” (now available in printed form)
he discarded lighthearted sniping for
more serious and constructive criti-
cisms. His lecture reflected the changed
Australia of the past decade. Ten years
ago Kennedy, who once boasted publicly
(and quite inaccurately) that he had
never read a book but acquired his learn-
ing from life, would no more have
dreamed of mentioning international af-
fairs in such a lecture than a friend's
physical deformities, but for a different
reason. In his view international af-
fairs were a long way away and there
were no votes in them. But his Chifley
Lecture revealed that he now knew that
they were much closer, and even though


there still might not be a vote in them they
w'ould be a major factor in Australia’s
life.
Kennelly pleaded now' for more Aus-
tralianism —and adequacy—in reporting
in the Australian Press, particularly in
Asia. Re-echoing a viewpoint w'hich, to
judge from Hansard for the Senate and
the House of Representatives, is gathering
strength in the Federal Parliament, Ken-
nelly said: “Metropolitan newspapers and
the ABC should have a larger number
of full-time correspondents abroad . . .
who can give reports of significant new's
from areas of potential crises long before
the crises have actually erupted. It costs
approximately £.10,000 a year to main-
tain a correspondent in Singapore. I
believe the big press groups could w'ell
afford to maintain many more overseas
correspondents.
“Obviously it is impossible for us to
provide sufficient overseas correspondents
to give us our own (Australian) first-hand
information about all world events.
But at least consideration should be
given to having our own correspondents
attached to some of the lesser world new r s
agencies to act as monitors providing us
wdth information of importance to this
particular region. *
“Government action could help
facilitate news - gathering overseas,” he
said. “Increased subsidies would allow'
for cheaper transmission of news by
telegraph.”
On this question it was obvious that
for once Kennelly and the Press were
seeing eye to eye. For Kennelly it was
quite a simple issue. He wanted to read
international news written by men study-
ing its possible effect upon Australia and
not by men who examined it from the
British or US standpoint.
BUSINESS
A Victory for
the Oil Monopolists
No crashing the coastal trade
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
R. W. MILLER
Steamed up
HThe international oil companies would
seem to have won a resounding vic-
tory in the coal versus oil battle by last
week’s Federal Government decision to
ban the further importation of second-
hand tankers by R. W. Miller and Co.,
or anybody else wanting to horn in on
the coastal oil-carrying trade which the
oil companies now' monopolise. For this
oil users can sigh with relief, for the pre-
sent, anyway.
If Millers had been allowed carte
blanche to capture the trade it was a vir-
tual certainty that prices of oil products
would have to be increased. That w r as
Miller’s basic idea. It was a desperate
attempt to bridge the present gap between
the low costs of carrying oil around the
coasts in the foreign-manned tankers of
the oil companies and the higher costs
incurred by coal owners shipping Aus-
tralian vessels manned predominantly by
Australian crews.
Former NSW Rugby Union star,
Roderick William Miller, the 52 year-old
chairman of Millers and also since last
year a director of Ampol, the only user
of an Australian-built tanker, the P. J.
Adams, on the coastal “milk runs”, was
so steamed up at the decision that he
seemed to threaten reprisals against the
Government-ow'ned Australian National
line. He told a reporter, “I am not going
to take this lying down. The Government
needn’t think it can treat us like that.
Our corppany is the Australian National
Line’s second biggest customer”.
It is not only that Miller's plan has been
spiked. The decision also means that
it could lose the deposits it had paid on
tw f o second-hand overseas tankers it had
confidently been expecting to import, and
also be forced to cancel contracts let for
another two.
The surprising thing is that the com-
pany w'ent ahead with the ordering of
these additional tankers because the
Prime Minister informed it, in a tele-
gram on July 26, that permission to im-
port one tanker (the Merchant Knight,
since renamed Millers Canopus ) due
to arrive in Sydney this week, was not to
be taken as a precedent, and that no other
application to import tankers would be
considered until the whole position had
been thoroughly examined.
It is a moot point whether, in this fur-
ther examination of the position, the re-
presentations of the oil companies or the
case for building tankers in Australian
shipyards in preference to importing
them has counted the most.
It is understood, for instance, that be-
fore the international oil companies ven-
tured on their massive refinery building
programmes here ten or so years ago,
they were given certain assurances by
the Federal Government that they would
have unrestricted rights to man tankers
on coastal “milk runs” with whatever
nationals and on whatever terms they
liked (coal shippers are, of course,
obliged under Section 228 of the Naviga-
tion Act to use vessels sailing under Aus-
tralian union conditions).
Not only that. x\t least two of the oil
companies, Shell and Caltex, alert to
Miller’s play, decided in July to ask the
Government if they also could import
tankers and ply them under the Austra-
lian flag despite the increase in costs in-
volved and notwithstanding any previous
arrangements made for using overseas
crews. While such moves might be in-
terpreted as being purely defensive, they
could not be neglected by the Govern-
ment in agreeing or otherwise to moves
that would, after all, cut across the
legitimate business of the oil companies
in favor of an outside company seeking
to further its own and not necessarily
national interests.
If the importation of second-hand
overseas tankers is, in fact, finally ruled
out (though by refusing Miller’s appli-
cation Cabinet has intimated that its
formulation of policy on the matter is
now finally completed) clearly Miller’s
only course would be to build tankers
here, which is something the Govern-
ment would dearly like to see. Moreover
if the oil companies, at least one of whom
has been toying with the idea for some
time, did likewise, the problem of em-
ploying the full capacity of Australian
shipyards could disappear. At present
it is acute. For instance, Evans, Deakin
and Co., the big Brisbane shipbuilder,
stated recently it had work for only 350
men compared with its peak employ-
ment of more than 1000.
As long ago as May 6th, the Minister
of Transport said he was prepared to
agree in principle to the importation of
tankers on the understanding that for
each tanker imported a new tanker would
be ordered from Australian shipyards.
Though no such condition was forced on
Millers when consent was given for im-
porting the Merchant Prince, the com-
pany has been exploring the possibilities
of building a tanker here since February
without, however, placing an order.
The question now ? is W'hether, with so
much bad blood flowing, the company
will ever order one. It could decide to
give up the whole idea of crashing the
coastal oil carrying trade. As Mr L. H.
McDonald, managing director of Evans,
Deakin, put it, “Millers will not be able


to operate successfully with one tanker:
it must have at least another four or five
to have ships available at all refinery
ports”.
To build a fleet of five tankers suit-
able for the coastal trade in Australian
shipyards would cost around £l5 million
of which a third could probably be re-
covered from subsidies. It might be too
tall an order, even for Millers.
CENSORSHIP
The Stephen Ward
Case in New Zealand
A town like Hawera
FROM RON TAYLOR IN AUCKLAND
VICKI BARRETT
Horsewhipping
\IfHEN London prostitute Vicki Barrett
sniggeringly told a packed Old
Bailey of canings and horsewhippings
she was paid to give men in Stephen
Ward's flat, she knew her story would
make headlines in the world press.
Next morning, 12,000 miles away in
the small farming town of Hawera
(pop. 5800) in the North Island of
New Zealand, Howard Thomas Brock
read Vicki’s story on the front page of
the “Daily News”, published in nearby
New Plymouth city, by Taranaki
Newspapers Ltd.
Brock was “disgusted” considered
the story “journalistic prostitution”
and, without even waiting for breakfast,
proceeded to canvass the town to find
out what the rest of the citizenry
thought about it.
Reaction was mixed. Some people
thought it' “sporting stuff”. Others like
Brock were so shocked at the staid
“Daily News” printing such a story that
they gave him financial backing to prose-
cute the paper for publishing an indecent
document under New Zealand’s anti-
quated Indecent Publications Act, 1910.
Brock, a 42-year-old married man
with six children and assistant engineer
to the Hawera Borough Council, got
£2OO for legal fees subscribed by 20
people. He briefed Hawera lawyer Tom
Ross to take the case.
But first, under the terms of the Act,
Brock had to get permission from
Attorney - General Ralph Hannan to
bring a private prosecution against the
“Daily News”. This he got without much
trouble.
Tom Ross brought two charges against
the “Daily News”, the first that the
company printed an indecent document
on July 25, the second that it sold an
indecent document. A Wellington lawyer,
Herbert Taylor, was briefed for the
defence, and the company pleaded not
guilty when the case came before Mr
A. W. Yortt, S.M., in the Hawera Police
Court on September 10.
The hearing lasted a day during which
Brock in evidence accused the news-
paper, or Reuters news service he
wasn’t quite sure which of “picking
out the juicy bits” from Vicki's story. He
was backed up in his assertion by gum-
chewing patriarch of Hawera’s Roman
Catholics, 80-year-old Monsignor Patrick
Cullen, 33 years a priest in the town and
headmaster of the church school. Some
weeks before, Monsignor Cullen from
the pulpit told his flock to cancel their
subscription to the “Daily News”.
Mr Yortt reserved his decision. Last
week he gave his judgment the Daily
News was guilty on both charges. On
the first Mr Yortt convicted and fined the
newspaper £3O, on the second the com-
pany was convicted and discharged. He
also gave Brock £2l costs and £4
witnesses’ expenses. Brock commented:
“My stand is vindicated. I took this case
because I thought the ‘Daily News’ was
overstepping the mark. I wanted no per-
sonal publicity, for that matter I want
none now. But if there’s an appeal I’ll
fight it.”
Opinion in Hawera on Brock’s action
differs widely. In a district where there
are 12 pubs to serve the parched cow
cockies, and part of a province which
now holds New Zealand's number one
Rugby trophy, the Ranfurly Shield,
there's some alarm that the rest of the
world will think the place inhabited by
tea-drinking, bible-banging wowsers.
Which is certainly not the case. Some
people think Brock has done a good job;
others think the sooner the case is for-
gotten the better.
But all concede that whatever Howard
Brock may or may not be, he is at least
sincere. An Englishman from Forrest
Hill, London, Brock came to New Zea-
land in .1947. He was serving with the
Royal Engineers of the British Army in
India and asked to take his discharge
here.
He married a New Zealand girl. The
eldest of their children four boys and
two girls is 12, the youngest 2. Brock
has been in Hawera as the town’s assis-
tant engineer for three and a half years.
Before that he was with the Patea County
Council and also spent six and a half
years with the Ministry of Works. Now
he is soon to resign from the Hawera
Council “it’s got nothing to do with
the case” to become a drainage con-
A TASMANIAN SUNDAY
fwMuttetCn
80 Years Ago: October 20, 1883
T*hus the Melbourne HERALD upon
the Victorian Police: “The force
is so utterly demoralised that it has
become a bye-word and a reproach;
a something to be scoffed at, and,
metaphorically, spat upon; a perfect
sink of iniquity and corruption, call-
ing trumpet-tongued for immediate
and thorough reformation.” Think of
that!
is getting quite a lively
little place. A few Sundays ago,
on Cataract Hill, Launceston, a band
of brothers and a squad of sisters
boxed together, and commenced to
“sing an ’im”. Then three young
inebriates began to ring cow-bells, and
a nigger, who had also been where
the corn was waving, pulled off his
shirt and offered to fight any man in
the crowd. Then the force came
along, and the mob stoned them, and
some sinner hit the leader of the
revivalists in the face with a dead cat.
Whilst the constables were endeavor-
ing to haul the colored gentleman off
to gaol, the crowd pulled at his heels
with such a hearty good-will that in
about eleven seconds all his clothes
came off. Then one of the police-
men trod on a dog who at once took
a piece out of his calf, and, in the
subsequent scrimmage, the nigger got
away. Thereupon, the sisters picked
the grass out of their hair, and
Brother Potts gave a hurried benedic-
tion. This is certainly a very nice way
to spend Sunday.

OBITUARY
Commissioner Porter’s
Achievement
“Police are servants“
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
S. H. PORTER
P.R. in depth
T7'ictoria’s police chief, Selwyn Have-
* lock Porter, who died last week
aged 58, will go down as the man who
not only changed the public image of the
force he controlled but its quality as
well. He never had a force as large as
he believed necessary and frequently re-
minded governments of this. His abilities,
therefore, were increasingly concentrated
into lifting the quality and efficiency of
the men he controlled.
His appointment, in August, 1954, by
the Cain Labor Government, puzzled the
public and annoyed many senior officers
of the force. Mr Porter had had a dis-
tinguished army career, starting in 1924,
when he joined the Citizen Forces as a
19-year-old bank clerk. In 1936 he was
a major and during the war successively
commanded the 11th, 30th and 24th In-
fantry Brigades, winning the DSO in
Syria and the CBE for operations in
Moratai and Labuan. He eventually rose
to become GOC of the 3rd Division of
the Citizen Forces with the rank of
Major-General.
Prior to his police appointment he was
staff manager for the Myer Emporium.
One senior police official jibed that the
force would “become a cross between
an army and a chain store”. In fact,
Mr Porter did introduce more army dis-
cipline and the force was better for
it. His new promotion system, his drive
for efficiency and his insistence that the
police were servants, not masters of the
public, were for a time widely resented.
Even after four years in office, he was
the subject of a no-confidence motion
by a meeting of 1000 members of the
Police Association.
Much has rightly been said of his suc-
cess in police public relations. It was
not, however, a success achieved through
manipulation of publicity media or PR
handouts it went much deeper than
that. The public image of the police was
slowly changed because of Porter’s suc-
cess in changing the attitudes and conduct
of the police themselves. It was public
relations in depth; constables who over-
stepped the mark or who had behaved
officiously were lectured on public rela-
tions, sometimes by Mr Porter himself.
Mr Porter, for example, refused to per-
mit “snoop” methods by police engaged
in traffic duties. Members of the force
engaged on traffic work proclaim them-
selves to the world by their sky-blue cars
and do not leap upon unsuspecting citi-
zens from disguised vehicles. Mr Porter
believed that disguises were all right in
their place, but to use them on traffic
matters would only breed public hostility.
Gradually the image, of the policeman
as a loutish brute was replaced by the
concept of officials who were understand-
ing and ready to help. It is a point
graphically obvious in the different atti-
tudes towards the police of Victoria and
NSW citizens.
His death occurred soon after his re-
turn from a world tour during which he
represented Australia at a conference of
Interpol in Helsinki. Scientific advances
which could be applied to police work
always interested him, but first he was a
humanist.


Around Melbourne
AUSSIE RULES-IN AND OUT OF SEASON
Tt is all over, and once again we
have the agonising thought: how
are we to face those long, dreary,
summer Saturdays ahead? There are
some small comforts. “Football Re-
play” will start soon and we will have
all the matches played back to us
through the summer.
Then on the Monday morning after
the Grand Final, we witnessed one of
the recording achievements of our
time. In all the shops there was a
small LP. On one side there was the
actual radio broadcast of the last
quarter and, on the other, interviews
with the players after the match. So
there’s a souvenir one will be able
to treasure for all time.
Oh, it is much easier for the play-
ers. The football teams of Melbourne
and Geelong have flown off to Hawaii
and San Francisco, and already pic-
tures are filtering back showing them
spreading our culture among the
hula girls of Honolulu. However, we
all appreciate that this is far more
than an end-of-season holiday. Our
men are missionaries, spreading the
good word. They will give exhibition
matches, and it is expected that once
Americans see the magic of their
play, Australian Rules will sweep the
US, although one columnist has been
unkind enough to suggest: “Say, in
that heady atmosphere of Honolulu,
the scheme backfires?” They put the
thought that our beloved Polly
Farmer, the best on the ground last
Saturday, might return home in a
blue and white crash helmet, nylon
knee breeches and padded shoulders
like Superman.
Just for the benefit of historians,
who will look to The Bulletin 100
years from now, Geelong beat Haw-
thorn 109 points to 60 before a
crowd of 101,452 people.
The events during the match were
not nearly as interesting as those that
came after it. Geelong is 50 miles
from Melbourne. It is Victoria’s lar-
gest provincial city with a population
of nigh on 100,000. In Melbourne
there is a hopeless mix-up of faiths
for the various clubs through the
suburbs. Ah, but in Geelong you
have an entire city pulsing, breathing
for the one football club, and this was
their first premiership for 11 years.
Take the local Member, Mr Hu-
bert Opperman, for example. He was
in one helluva fix. It would have been
political suicide for him not to be
present at the match. The Prime
Minister’s sister was launching a ship
in Brisbane that morning. As Minister
for Shipping and Transport he had
to be there. He had things organised.
The ship hit the water at 11.40 a.m.
A police motor-cyclist, equipped with
siren, took the Minister from Kan-
garoo Point to Eagle Farm to catch
an aircraft at 11.55 p.m., and a driver,
with car engine running, was waiting
to speed him to the MCG the minute
he arrived in Melbourne.
Mr Opperman was just one of the
pulsing, breathing Geelong citizens.
At 9.30 p.m., the whole city was
waiting for the return of the vic-
torious legion. The sight at the Town
Hall was unbelievable. There were at
least 6000 out front, completely jam-
ming the block.
HPhey were all in a state of euphoria,
A jumping, singing, chanting blood-
thirsty Geelong songs. The moment of
purest bliss was when Polly Farmer
came to the top and held aloft the
Premiership Cup.
The lean, dreary years were over.
Everybody made speeches, from the
Mayor of Geelong through to the
coach, Bob Davis. Mr Davis held up
the cup: “This cup is for you. You
were the people who brought it to
Geelong. We wanted to do it for you
and we done it today.” (Cheers.)
And so it went on, and on, and on,
with speeches and celebrations which
didn’t finish until the dawn.
Now on the Sunday at noon, there
was a most interesting ceremony. It
was almost reminiscent of a Biblical
sacrifice. In 1952, when Geelong won
the flag from Collingwood, the club
shot a magpie and had a ceremonial
burying. The tradition had to go on,
and the emblem of Hawthorn is the
Hawk.
On the Sunday morning, a thou-
sand-odd people were waiting at Gee-
long’s GHQ, Kardinia Park. At noon,
a slow-marching cortege came out of
the pavilion on to the oval, to the
accompaniment of muffled drum
beats. The players carried a door on
their shoulders. On the door was a
small coffin wrapped in a Hawthorn
guernsey. The club president, Jack
Jennings, said the coffin contained a
sparrowhawk they had shot that
morning. Dressed as a preacher was
the ruckman from Western Australia,
John Watts. The cortege stopped at
a grave dug on the west side of the
cricket pitch.
John Watts, holding a prayer book,
stood at the edge of the grave
and then called on the crowd to sing
hymn number 606 which turned out
to be the Geelong Club song. The
grave was filled in, while “Father”
Watts intoned, “Ashes to ashes, dust
to dust, rest in peace.”
The local newspaper received a
number of letters of protest. Some
suggested it was blasphemy, “An act
of the worst possible taste.” “Dis-
gusted Magpies” (Reservoir) wrote:
“Would any other club beating
Geelong have buried a cat?” Another
reader pointed out that this dreadful
thing happened during Animal and
Bird Week.
Now that it is all over, there's the
interesting speculation just how
many would have gone to the Grand
Final had the seats been available?
A rough guess sets it at 150,000.
lan Johnson, secretary of the Mel-
bourne Cricket Club, with all the
cunning of an ex-“ Argus” man, an-
nounced his plans for the rebuilding
of the Grey Smith Stand just 48 hours
before the bounce. The new stand
will raise the capacity of the ground
to 125,000, and lan Johnson hopes
to have it ready for the 1965-66
England-Australia Test series. Actu-
ally this is stage two of the master
plan. Stage three will mean the re-
building of the members’ stand and
adding a third deck to the outer
stand. And when that comes about
the MCG will have a capacity of
150,000.
All of us hope, sincerely, that this
will come about before too many
magpies, sparrowhawks, et alia , have
been ceremoniously interred.

“Boy! A V-Jet really travels. Our Qantas pilot said it’s faster than a shot from a colt .45. So
you’d think they’d call it the Cowboys and Indians Route to London. But Qantas calls it the Kanga-

Singapore’s Fantastic
Mr Lee Kuan Yew
"At Cambridge I got two firsts ... Harold Macmillan did not "
From ALEX JOSEY IN Singapore
ON Malaysia Day, September 16th,
1963, Lee Kuan Yew, Prime
Minister of Singapore, celebrating
that day his fortieth birthday, emerged
as the leader of 41 million Chinese in
Sabah, Sarawak, Malaya and Singapore.
Traditionally, the leadership of the
Chinese in these places has always dwelt
in Singapore For more than a century
merchants, clerks and coolies in this
bustling port have looked upon Singapore
as the headquarters of the clans and the
societies which continue to play an
essential part in Chinese life.
On Malaysia Day, Lee became recog-
nised publicly as the voice of the Chinese.
For he who speaks for the Chinese in
Singapore speaks as well for all the
Chinese in Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Sibu,
Miri, Jesselton, Penang, Seremban and
all the other large towns of Malaysia
where the Chinese live. If shadows of
doubt had existed and in the minds of
Tan Siew Sin, the Tunku’s Finance Min-
ister, and certain unelected Senators
belonging to the Malayan Chinese As-
sociation, some might have existed, they
had been brushed away when Lee, shortly
before, demanding a blood debt from the
Japanese for atrocities committed during
the* war, was acclaimed by 100,000
cheering people on the Padang.
On September 21, few of his friends
were surprised that Lee won the gen-
eral elections, and established beyond
question that he spoke for Singapore,
and could claim now to speak for
Chinese-speaking Malaysians everywhere.
But not even Lee believed he would also,
at this time, be accepted in Singapore
by the Malays as their leader in non-
communalism.
On the eve of the poll, in a dramatic
gesture, the Tunku, surprisingly per-
suaded by his Kuala Lumpur Chinese ad-
visers, intervened in the general election.
Lee was shocked. Earlier, he had made a
public announcement that the People’s
Action Party would not contest next
year’s Federal elections. He was also
given to understand that the Tunku would
not interfere in Singapore’s elections.
Yet, a few hours before 618,000 voters
went to the polling boths, the Tunku
appealed publicly to the Singapore elec-
torate to vote for his Alliance Party.
People thought that the weight of the
Tunku’s great prestige would seriously
effect the PAP's chances, especially in
those constituencies with large numbers
of Malays.
Nothing of the sort happened. On the
contrary, most Malays voted for the
PAP, and non-racialism. In an emphatic
manner the Malays in Singapore told
the Tunku they preferred Lee Kuan
Yew’s leadership in Singapore to the
dubious Chinese leadership the Tunku,
unknowingly, was recommending, even
though this meant voting against
United Malays National Organization
candidates.
Disappointed and angry that the Sing-
apore Malays rejected all the UMNO
candidates, the Tunku, famed for his
sporting activities on the football field,
and the race track, failed to send Lee
a word of congratulations on winning
the elections. Instead, the Tunku issued
a churlish statement saying how shocked
he was. He blamed Malay traitors for
UMNO’s staggering defeat. He criticis-
ed the elections, “hurriedly arranged”,
though he grudging admitted that the
PAP was a well-organised political force
capable of keeping the Communists in
their proper place.
Then Tuan Syed Ja’afar Albar, a pro-
minent and petulant official of UMNO,
made some explosive comments which
were much less philosophical. Albar
charged Lee Kuan Yew with being a 100
per cent dictator, and he promised to
“fix him” when he showed up in the
Malaysian Parliament. Albar added:
“We are prepared to use both fists and
words to teach Lee a lesson in demo-
cracy.”
Tuan Syed Ja’afar Albar’s rage gen-
erated because the Malays in Singapore
refused to vote for a communal organ-
isation headed by the Tunku. They sup-
ported the non-racial People’s Action
Party instead. Most observers could
understand the Tunku’s delicate position.
He is, after all, the leader of the Malays,
and he could hardly refuse to associate
himself with an outburst of Malay sur-
prise and pain, illogical though it might
appear to him as a non-racist, and still
remain in the eyes of the majority of the
Malays their fearless defender.
In that mood, the Tunku hastened to
Singapore, accompanied by Tuan Syed
Ja’afar Albar, and at a mass rally of
UMNO supporters he made the rather
odd remark that Lee had profited by
playing upon the people’s fear of Com-
munism. At the same time the Tunku
repeated that certain Malays betrayed
UMNO during the elections. He predict-
ed they would not last long. In cold
print, away from the emotionalism of
a Malay political meeting, this severe
criticism of sophisticated Malays, con-
demned because they voted for Lee Kuan
Yew’s non-communalism, appears strange
coming from such a noted non-commun-
alist as the Tunku. But they were mild

compared to the vicious outburst from
Albar. The Tunku was forced to watch
while Lee’s pictures were burnt.
Lee could not remain silent. At a
meeting hurriedly convened near the
General Post Office the following day,
Lee stressed the need for co-operation
“on equal terms, not that of master and
servant,” and he called for an intelligent
appraisal of realities. “There are,” he
pointed out, “in Malaysia 43 per cent
Malays and indigenous people, 41 per
cent Chinese, 10 per cent Indians, and
six per cent others.” In other words, Lee
warned the Malays they were in no
position to throw their weight around. He
asked UMNO not to look upon the PAP
as a hostile force just because the PAP
defeated all the UMNO candidates, but
as a political rival, like themselves pro-
democratic and pro-Malaysia. He said
that the PAP Government was anxious to
co-operate fully with the Central Govern-
ment. He acknowledged their final
supremity.
Within hours, the Tunku came out
with a carefully worded statement,
stoutly defending his Chinese advisers
and the MCA against Lee’s telling
attacks. At the same time, the Tunku
promised that the Central Government
will work closely with the Government
of Singapore. At once Lee Kuan Yew,
preparing to leave for Kuala Lumpur,
welcomed the Tunku’s response and offer
of co-operation, and, he added, “I accept
his conditions”. Gestures having been
made on both sides, Lee began dis-
cussions in the capital to “sort out dif-
ficulties and set the course for honorable
co-operation for the next five years”.
In this amiable manner, the leaders of
the two main communities in Malaysia
calmed their followers, teeth having been
bared mainly to please the militants, and
started to get down to the tasks ahead.
Other differences are certain to arise in
the future, but fortunately both men
realise each other’s difficulties: each
appreciates that there are wild men, like
Tuan Syed Ja’afar Albar, in all com-
munities, and they know that these are
the people capable of causing a lot of
emotional trouble unless carefully
handled. Allowances for this must be
made.
Unsmiling, serious but happy
T ee considers the Tunku an astute
Malay politician. Lee has never made
any specific public utterance about the
Tunku’s handling of foreign affairs,
although Lee’s attitude might be assessed
from Lee's own comments on Singapore’s
position following the Manila Talks, but
there is no ambiguity about Lee’s genuine
feelings of the Tunku as a man, and as
the leader of the Malays. In a message
to the Tunku on his 60th birthday, earlier
in the year, Lee described the Tunku as
“the symbol of a tolerant, happy and
prosperous country”. Lee added: “Every
time when the Tunku appears, it is
always the tolerant, cheerful personality
moving easily among all races and
classes a man completely at ease, re-
laxed, at peace with himself and with the
world, practical, and, most important of
all, successful.”
Malaysia is fortunate that the two
dominant political personalities are in
some aspects dissimilar. In leadership
and public affairs, tolerance and cheerful-
ness can often be no less important than
a talented ability to concentrate seriously,
and at high pressure, upon urgent prob-
lems of the day. Yet Lee’s and the
Tunku’s individual traits and charac-
teristics, as well as their differing
political views and ethnic backgrounds,
to some extent makes intimate collabora-
tion, essential if Malaysia is to thrive,
not an easy matter for either man.
Fortunately they realise each other’s
problems, and both know they must live
with each other and work as closely to-
gether as they can.
Unlike the relaxed Tunku, Lee’s
attitude towards life is unsmilingly
serious. There is nothing ever flippant
about him, nothing careless, nothing not
well done, whether it is ordering a meal,
going for a walk, fixing his tie, doing up
his shoe-laces, opening a bottle of beer,
or making a golf stroke. Whatever he
does, however trivial, merits his closest
attention. But, if he is serious he is not
unhappy. On the contrary: he is prob-
ably happier than most. Married, with
three bright and healthy children, and a
highly intelligent and most charming
wife, herself a lawyer’s lawyer of noted
ability, Lee knows joy and contentment.
His family are constantly in his mind:
he refers to them in his speeches: he
works for them and he plans for them,
politically, as he plans and works for
all families. He is a family man.
But, unlike his friend and colleague,
Dr Goh Keng Swee, the Minister for
Finance, often to be found chuckling to
himself about some oddity of life, Lee
finds little to laugh about. Nowadays,
determined to soften his public image, he
will hurriedly adjust his lips to a smile
should a photographer be around. But
then, as the Malays say, the heart doe*
not smile. Lee is too intense. Life is
too grim for him to chuckle over
trivialities: chuckling won’t solve prob-
lems. Serious intellectual exercise might.
Malicious observers say that a political
opponent’s discomfort is certain to raise
a laugh with Lee at any time, and this
is probably true. But humor the world
over is based upon suffering in some
form or another. Who can resist laugh-
ing when somebody is kicked in the
pants, or slips on a banana skin? When
the Tunku, for example, was told that
Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew had been
pushed into a deep drain by a mob he
was trying to reason with, the genial
Tunku is reported to have laughed until
tears came into his eyes. Life, as Dr Goh
Keng Swee might have remarked, is like
that.
How not to make friends
T>ecause he is unrelaxed, because he
** cannot suffer fools, because he be-
lieves there are so many wrongs and
deficiencies and problems in the world
that must be solved and put right so that
people can live better, get more to eat,
have a more reasonable life, Lee does not
make friends easily. He is not willing to
mingle socially. He gets no enjoyment
from cocktail parties and refuses to attend
unless protocol insists: he will rarely
accept an invitation to a meal unless
business is to be discussed over food. Lee
seldom reads a novel, never goes to the
cinema. But he can be tempted to play
chess with the children, or talk to them
in English, Mandarin, Hokkien or Malay.
Being of Chinese origin, he is incapable
of squandering time, or losing an op-
portunity to increase his knowledge.
Living a full life, much of it dedicated
to putting his world right, the rest being
given over to his family, and essential
exercise for health reasons, being alert
against possible machinations by politi-
cal enemies, and constantly watchful of
his health (he is edging towards hypo-
chondria), Lee’s full daily schedule
leaves him scant time to enlarge his circle
of friends, even if he wanted to, and he
has no such inclination. Closest to him,
after the immediate members of his
family, are his political cronies. They
have gone through political fire together:
they have been tested and friendship has
survived and been cemented.
What must be remembered when ex-
amining the relationship between Lee
and the Tunku is the fact that Lee is a
Socialist and a hardworking Malaysian
of Chinese origin, conscious of a culture
that goes back 4,000 years, a culture with
a profound literature and rich language
created by hosts of philosophers, paint-
ers, poets, writers, administrators and
soldiers. Tunku Abdul Rahman is an edu-
cated feudal prince. There is no com-

parable Malay culture: there is no litera-
ture, no history except of piracy. Be-
tween the two men, the Tunku 20 years
older, flowers a friendly feeling: both
hate racialism, love freedom, Malaysia,
and humans, and both in their different
ways want to better the lot of the people,
Lee by planning and organisation, the
Tunku in other ways.
“Mine is a government of the Right,”
the Tunku will admit. “I believe in free
enterprise, properly controlled, and I
believe in private ownership of pro-
perty”. Lee will say: “I am a Socialist.
But Socialism in an entrepot is impos-
sible. In Malaysia there is a multi-racial
population. We must proceed warily.
Our social revolution must be paced not
by the urban Chinese but by the rural
Malays. They will decide the speed and
method of our Socialism”.
Profunio puzzled him
llHithout qualification Lee recognises
" the Tunku as the leadei of the Malays.
He says, time and time again, to reas-
sure worried Malays, that at least not
for another two decades can any person
other than a Malay, or someone indi-
genous of Malaysia, become Prime Min-
ister of Malaysia. For his part, the
Tunku knows that Lee Kuan Yew firmly
controls Singapore, and has mass support
from the Chinese in all the big towns
throughout Malaysia. In these circum-
stances, sooner or later, political expedi-
ency, if nothing else, is bound to force
the Tunku to abandon his present Chinese
advisers, no longer representing anybody,
in favor of Lee Kuan Yew’s People’s
Action Party.
Lee knows this, but he also understands
the Tunku's reluctance to break old ties:
the Tunku seldom dismisses anybody:
rather than take necessary ruthless ac-
tion, the Tunku often will seek to pro-
mote them out of the way. No man in
high office is more loyal to those once
loyal to him than the Tunku An ad-
mirable quality in lesser men, perhaps,
this excessive loyalty can be an em-
barrassment to politicians. Knowing all
this, Lee must bide his time, confident
that, eventually, not too late, he hopes,
the Tunku will willingly, in his own way,
make active collaboration possible. If it
is true as most realists insist, that the
Malayan Chinese Association has lost the
confidence of the Chinese, and the Peop-
le’s Action Party has become the voice
of the Chinese in Malaysia, this must
happen eventually, for Malaysia will
flounder if the Malays and the Chinese
do not work harmoniously together. This
is impossible unless the leadership of
both is genuinely representative, and not
spurious.
What sort of man is Lee Kuan Yew?
He is of Hakka stock. The Hakkas are
men from the north: they are the tough
invaders: the aggressors. Lee is kindly,
sensitive, and sensible, believing in the
legal order of things, and in the need
for a high standard of public and priv-
ate morals. Lee was genuinely puzzled
about the Profumo-Keeler scandal:
he could not begin to understand how
a Minister could get himself involved in
such sordidness He could not reason how
a man in Profumo’s high position could
take even the first step towards the girl.
Old-fashioned Englishmen would classify
Lee as an essentially decent man: a man
impatient, perhaps, of man’s weaknesses,
intolerant of slip-shod work, angry with
dereliction of duty and abuse of trust,
and misuse of the public’s confidence.
This does not make Lee stuffy so much
as tough. Whatever he says or does, the
fighting, suspicious Hakka peers through.
Lee has not always been aware of his
tough exterior. He was, in fact, shocked
to discover how rough and aggressive,
almost bellicose, “gangster-like” in his
own words, he must have appeared, he
thought, to others, when he saw him-
self on television for the first time. He
was silent for a few moments. Then he
said: “Good God!” He saw a fierce, men-
acing'figure glowering at him, unsmiling,
ready to give a blow, take a blow. He
did like what he saw. This was not
the figure the political Lee wanted to
present to the electorate: and from that
moment Lee set out, unwisely some
thought, to soften the lines.
But the screen did not lie, and in Asia,
where politics and living call for tough
leadership, friends wondered whether
advantage was to be gained from hiding
the truth, which is that Hakka Lee turned
Malaysian is an admixture of aggression
and wary defence. His public speeches,
if not his television smiles, are punctu-
ated with evidence of his true personality.
“I am prepared to meet, anywhere, any-
time,” he says. “I’ll fix you,” he threatens.
To some, this fighting spirit, always on
hand, appears as a symptom of latent
inferiority, or basic insecurity. “What’s
the matter with Lee?” demanded his old
political enemy, Tun Lim Yew Hock.
“The man keeps on saying he will fight,
fight, fight. He’s always wanting to
fight.” But to most people all this is a
manifestation of Lee’s intellectual and
physical courage. “You have just got to
face these things,” Lee will say. “You
can’t run away.”
There was nothing flamboyant about
Lee’s attitude towards Indonesia’s threat
to Malaysia. Here was firmness, clarity,
statesmanship. Early this year, Dr
Subandrio, the Indonesian Foreign
Minister, called upon him. They had
“full and frank” discussions about
Malaysia. An official statement put out
later by Lee said that Subandrio ex-
plained that “Indonesia’s opposition was
not against Malaysia as such, but against
certain attitudes and circumstances which
he feared might be carried into Malaysia.”
Lee said that Subandrio pointed out,
“in his statements made as far back as
18 months ago, that when the Malaysia
concept was first raised, he made no
objections.” Lee told Subandrio that if
Indonesia was not opposed to Malaysia
he was confident that friendly relations
could be established and tension eased.
Lee told reporters that “in so far as the
circumstances and attitudes are man-
made, they can be man un-made”. Lee
made it clear to Subandrio, and to re-
porters, that he was solidly behind the
Tunku over Malaysia. Lee told news-
men: “Neither the Tunku or I contem-
plate a delay in the plans for Malaysia”.
In June, the Tunku met President
Soekarno in Tokyo; and Malaysia by
August 31 appeared to be confirmed.
Then came Manila at the end of July,
and Lee’s shock at learning that the
Tunku had apparently abandoned August
31 in an attempt to placate Indonesia’s
feelings. U Thant was to take a survey
of public opinion in the Borneo terri-
tories: the Tunku wanted to prove that
Malaysia was peace-loving, and that the
people of Borneo wanted freely to join
Malaysia. Lee flew to Kuala Lumpur,
and he and the Tunku talked for three
hours.
“We are small and tough”
T>ack in Singapore, tough Lee told the
world where he and Singapore and
Malaysia stood in the scheme of things,
as tough Ben Gurion the Zionist had
told the world where he and tiny Israel
stood in 1948. I was in Israel at the
time, as I was in Singapore on August
10th this year when Lee threw down
his challenge. “Small nations are likely
to be left alone in peace, if other people
know they are small but tough and
resolute,” he declared. He said that
Malaysia will have a place in the history
of South-East Asia, if the people have
the will and the determination to make
the new nation succeed. They must not,
he warned, allow themselves to be pushed
around.
These were the sort of words Ben
Gurion used. I reflected that both men


are scholars and fighters. “Malaysia
intends to survive and to defend its terri-
torial and national integrity.” Lee Kuan
Yew said this, and he added: “We shall
fight.” Nobody, knowing Lee, doubts
this. He is the type of man always pre-
pared for a highly intelligent approach to
problems, but ready at the same time to
fall into a fighting posture should he
believe that the situation demands urgent
action.
Lee’s aggressive personality is notice-
able, and felt, at once, just as the Tunku’s
relaxed affability instantly charms and
soothes. Lee has an astonishing ability to
focus his powerful intellect directly upon
the problem under consideration with
forceful and rapid directness, and this,
combined with his readiness to judge the
other person’s motives highly suspicious
and most likely damaging to his own
interests, leaves him, as it left that other
brilliant lawyer, Dr Herbert Evatt, in his
prime, with few endearing qualities. After
all, not many men have been able, at the
same time, to be tough, realistic, capable
of working under great pressure, at high
speed, efficiently, and for long hours,
and also be relaxed, ready to accept men
and matters at face value, and be
popular.
In the end, most ruthless seekers of
high standards and efficiency must be
content with men’s grudging respect until
they become old enough to be legends
worthy of affection and love.
Oddly enough, Lee’s natural suspicion
of people’s motives and actions, and his
past experience of meeting many men in
high places, in law courts, during trade
union negotiations and elsewhere, has
not made him a good judge of men’s
talents or ability. Lee is capable of
recognising outstanding merit, but on
occasions his judgment of lesser men is
faulty. He relentlessly drives the Civil
Service as he drives himself, and there
are times when he mistakes enthusiasm,
eagerness or pushfulness, for talent.
Praise or criticism, perhaps misplaced,
can upset civil servants, although nobody
doubts the honesty of purpose behind
the Prime Minister’s remarks.
“Produce the goods—and on time”
T ee is a supremely confident person,
whose confidence causes his enemies
to brand him as arrogant, and the People’s
Action Party to look upon him as an
anchor of security to sanity and resolve.
If arrogance means conceit, Lee is not
arrogant, but his confidence is realistically
based upon his belief that he is cleverer
than most, and this is proved in scholarly
and political examinations and tussles to
which Lee does not hesitate publicly to
refer.
He once told a group of civil servants,
illustrating a point: “I speak to Harold
Macmillan and Duncan Sandys as equals.
At Cambridge I got two firsts and a star
for distinction. Harold Macmillan did
not”. In the political arena he asked:
“Where is Tun Lim Yew Hock and his
party now? We have smashed them. We
thought these things out better than they
did”. He was justified: the Tun’s party
failed to win a single seat.
Lee’s confidence, essential in Asian
leadership, his sureness, highly developed
critical faculty, his impatience with less
than what he feels entitled to expect,
tends to make him unfair. He refuses to
listen to explanations, and this can be a
fault. “I want no excuses,” he will say.
“Produce the goods, and on time.” Lee
believes, with sincerity, that he could
make a good film, write a good book,
produce a good newspaper, build a good
house or a road, and do many other
things which experts tell us only experts
can do. And the aggravating truth is
that, given brief technical training, he
probably could do most things better
than many. Certain of this, Lee will not
readily listen to explanations of failure
or shortcomings. A snag is that, like
many other leaders and commanders,
Lee is not proficient at giving verbal
instructions. What, in his mind, could
be no more than a germ of an idea with
many aspects he will toss out for action.
What finally appears might be much
different to what Lee himself would have
produced. In the absence of clear-cut
and precise instructions this is inevitable:
minds work differently. What is
dangerous is that in trying to probe his
mind, and to please him and avoid un-
just criticism, there is a tendency for
assistants to play safe and create in
consequence a climate of sycophancy, a
grave threat to efficiency which Lee tries
desperately to avoid.
Because of this difficulty in giving
precise verbal instructions, Lee does not
rank as an outstanding organiser in
detail. Probably his mind is too sharp,
for frequently no sooner is a decision
made than it is amended or improved
upon. This may be one of the reasons
why critics in Kuala Lumpur say he is
far too agile. Yet there are probably few
men in Asia capable of matching Lee in
presenting an argument, forcefully,
reasonably, lucidly. His skilful explana-
tion to the United Nations Committee on
Colonialism of the true meaning of
Malaysia impressed seasoned statesmen
from the East as well as the West. They
felt that this was a performance not often
witnessed at the United Nations. Lee’s
skill as a debater began during college
days, and although, now and then, he
descends into frivolity and appears
anxious to score childish points, when
the occasions demand, Lee’s oratory, in
the opinion of experienced British Mem-
bers of Parliament, having listened to
him, is equal to the best heard in the
House of Commons.
Confronting the Communists
Tee is best in debate. In English, if
not in Malay, he is no great platform
speaker. He is no rabble-rouser and
could never arouse a mob as Soekarno
can. This is because Lee Kuan Yew
directs his words to a man’s common-
sense, not his emotions. Soekarno shouts
and rants, whereas Lee must explain and
argue, sometimes using words w'hich
send even the well-educated back to the
dictionary. One of Lee’s most pleasant
attributes, for a man reputed to be
arrogant, is his readiness to treat every-
body, for the first time, as his intellectual
equal. Lee’s attitude changes when the
discovery is made that the person is not.
Friends have been amazed that Lee
should pay attention to arguments from
persons obviously his intellectual inferior,
but Lee’s natural instinct is to expect
them to be as sensible as he is.
Keeping in touch with modern develop-
ments, Lee studies television techniques,
and it is on the screen rather than the
public platform that he now makes the
better impression. His appeal continues
to be to commonsense, to what is reason-
able, and sensible. Lee has never made
extravagant promises to the people. He
believes the ordinary man is not a fool,
and expects people to make the correct
judgment if they are told the truth and
given the facts. That is why Lee reasoned
that the people of Singapore must reject
Communism. “Let us meet the Com-
munists in open argument”: that was his
policy. “Confront them: match their
lies with truth: give facts when they
distort.” That is how Lee beat them at
the polls in September, scoring 37 seats
to the 13 captured by the pro-Communist
Barisan Sosialis, the 51st falling to
Ong Eng Guan, the former Mayor.
Over this question of combating Com-
munism, and over other issues, Lee Kuan
Yew and the Tunku have differed in
methods of approach, and there have
been times when their open disagree-
ment has alarmed mutual friends. For
a while, negotiations between Kuala
Lumpur and Singapore were bogged
down in the financial field: then, later,

It all looks grey until it’s put into black and white
All news is not equal.
Some is exciting, vital, intriguing,
contentious. Some may develop to-
morrow into this category—Some may
live only today. And some is minority-
interest stuff (exciting, vital, intrigu-

It is, we believe, the responsibility
of a newspaper to separate the grey
from the vivid.
We do it by positioning the news;
by the space we give a story; by the
time we keep at it bringing you
more facts.
Setting out the significant is the
basic task of the people who make a
newspaper important.
Determining the end of a story
and discovering another’s beginnings
is the quality that makes a newspaper
live.
Responsible editing brings to this
newspaper recognition that all news is
not equal—and, with it, reading which
is balanced according to the weight of
a story’s import.
Today people don’t want the grey
of a teleprinter.

there was hesitancy on the part of certain
Federation officials in carrying out under-
takings given by the Tunku in London.
Lee publicly blamed Malayan Chinese
Association officials for all this, and he
bitterly attacked them. Eventually he
had his own way, which was no more
than just, but the Tunku, loyal as al-
ways to his friends in the MCA, un-
representative though they now are of
the Chinese, as elections have proved,
was reported to be distressed.
His distress turned to anger when, on
August 31, Malaysia did not come into
being as planned and agreed in London,
and Lee Kuan Yew proclaimed that he
was taking over Defence and Foreign
Affairs from the British in Singapore on
behalf of the Central Government. At
once the Tunku indignantly hurried a
Note of protest to the United Kingdom,
and Duncan Sandys, resting on a British
warship off Borneo, raced back to Kuala
Lumpur with assurances. Satisfied, the
Tunku put out a statement saying, in
effect, that Lee’s claim did not make
sense.
Why Lee made this rather Gilbertian
claim, which was unremarked by British
generals and admirals responsible to the
British Government for Singapore’s def-
ence, and apparently unnoticed by Con-
sul-Generals accredited at Singapore
through Whitehall, has never been satis-
factorily explained. Yet Lee, since he
entered active politics in 1954, rarely
makes a move without careful prepar-
ation, and seldom blunders. If, by pro-
claiming. in effect, Singapore's indepen-
dence on August 31 was not a mistake,
in that it upset the Tunku and gained
no revealed advantage for Lee or his
party, it still remains a mystery not
understood by critic or supporter.
“The Japanese brought me politics”
VI/hat made Lee Kuan Yew enter poli-
" tics? “I did not enter politics,” Lee
insists. “The Japanese brought politics to
me.” In a recent speech he spoke about
the Japanese invasion of Singapore in
1942. He was then a student at Raffles
College, later to become the University
of Singapore. Lee said his whole world
suddenly collapsed. All the false values
were smashed. Overnight the country
that was Malaya and was theirs became
strange. Road signs appeared in Jap-
anese. The Japanese said: “Look, this
is our country, yours and mine.” Lee
said that he and his friends asked them-
selves: have they a right to do this?
He added: “Slowly enough we decided
that they had none: that this was our
country. We will govern it ourselves.”
Lee said that the Japanese occupying
forces were blind and brutal and made
him, and a whole generation like him in
Singapore, and Malaya, work for free-
dom freedom from servitude and
foreign domination. “I decided that from
then on our lives should be ours to decide,
that we should not be the pawn and play-
things of foreign powers.” In that hour
a Malaysian nationalist leader was born.
This solemn promise to free Singapore
from foreign rule, from colonial domi-
nation, was made in Singapore’s awful
darkness, when thousands of Australian
soldiers rotted in Changi Gaol, when the
people of Singapore groaned under the
oppressive rule of an alien dictatorship,
and when the young, rather bewildered
and hapless Malaysian, Lee Kuan Yew,
was 19 years old.
During the Japanese occupation, Lee
learned Japanese and became a trans-
lator for the official newsagency. When
the misery of those years finally ended,
Lee hurried off to Cambridge to complete
his education. He studied hard, paid
court to the girl student at Girton later
to become his wife, found time to play
golf, make a few visits to the Continent,
explore the South of F’ngland on his
motorcycle, and prepare himself mentally
for what he believed would be a stern
struggle to free Malaya from the bonds
of British colonialism. To this day Lee
is not prepared to believe that he return-
ed to kick an opening door. Clement
Attlee had already freed India and
Burma. Britain was in a mood to liquid-
ate colonial commitments as quickly as
possible. In Malaya, the Communists’ re-
volt held up constitutional progress, but
when the Tunku reorganised the United
Malays National Organization and form-
ed an alliance, the British Government
needed little persuasion to work with
an independent Malaya.
While the Malayan Communists, most-
ly Chinese, adopting terrorist methods,
fought to set up liberated areas, being
forced instead still further into the jung-
les, Lee, escaping briefly from his
studies, debated the future of Malaya at
the Malayan Forum, a group of overseas
Malayans created by the Tunku, in which
several of today’s leaders of Malaysia,
including Dr Toh Chin Chye, chair-
man of the PAP, Tun Razak, and Dr
Goh Keng Swee, tested their first serious
political beliefs in January, 1950, shortly
before returning to Singapore to join
a famous law office, Lee Kuan Yew
spoke to the Malayan Forum on “The
Returned Student”. He was 27. He told
the Forum that Malaya was the only
remnant of colonial imperialism left in
South-east Asia, “surrounded by new
Asian national States.” He thought that
the British would like nothing better
than to revert to the pleasant ordered
society of 1939. But “Empires never last
for ever.” He was confident his gener-
ation would be an end to colonial im-
perialism in Malaya, but he warned of
the danger of the Communists taking
over. He believed then, as he believes
now, that “the continued existence of the
new Asian States depends upon whether
they are able to carry out long overdue
reforms. Whether they can, without the
Communist religion, do all that a Com-
munist State can do for the masses.”
In Nehru’s words, whether they can pro-
duce the goods. Lee pleaded for racial
harmony and the development of a unit-
ed political front strong enough, “with-
out resorting to armed force,” to demand
a transfer of power. “We may take
heart,” he added with realism, “in the
knowledge that no one can concede more
graciously an already untenable position
than the British.”
Fighting for the Chinese
considers himself a loyal Malaysian
of Chinese origin. He is con-
vinced that nationhood demands the use
of the national language, which is Malay,
but he finds no contradiction in his
defence of Chinese language, education
and culture, so long as this is an addition
and not an alternative. Lee is inclined to
frown upon the wasteful and noisy habit
of celebrating everything with spluttering
Chinese crackers, especially as he knows
that the Malays detest them, but wisely,
knowing also the Chinese love of noise
to chase away evil, he does not interfere.
Quietly he opposes elaborate Chinese
funerals, feasts and useless traditions long
since abandoned in Peking. In spite of
all this, a great deal of the Hakka,
modernised, educated and progressive
though he undoubtedly is, remains in
Lee’s character. He is as proud as any
Chinese of his heritage.
Lee’s family association with Malaysia
goes back more than a hundred years.
There was an ancestor of Lee’s in Singa-
pore soon after Sir Stamford Raffles,
with his red-jacketed soldiers, rowed up
the muddy creek, where now stands
Singapore’s Assembly House which Lee
Kuan Yew’s oratory dominates as Chur-
chill dominated the House of Commons.
Lee’s great-grandfather was Lee Bok
Boon, and, in the manner of the Chinese
in those days, Bok Boon, having sailed
the China Sea to a foreign land in search
of gold, returned to China to die. Lee’s
grandfather, a poor Hakka peasant, also
came to Singapore to seek fortune.

OUT AND ABOUT
Girl With
The Laugh In
Her Voice
Alma Cogan in the crystal ball
By CHARLES HIGHAM
The door opened, there was a cloud
of expensive perfume, the biggest
mop of dark hair I have ever seen
on a human head, a smile, a flash of even
white teeth straight out of lan Fleming,
a flurry of flowered skirts and Alma
Cogan, the English singer, ushered me
into her rather dowdy hotel suite. “Wel-
come to my luxurious abode!” she said,
and The Girl With The Laugh In Her
Voice sank barefoot into the corner of
a sofa, to run briskly through a career
which had taken her to stardom in
Britain’s tough and often nasty show
business world.
For Alma, it was only tough and
nasty at first. Her account of the early
years was a summary of seediness which
didn’t darken her bright eyes for an in-
stant. “I was on tour with Mr Pastry in
the provinces,” she said without a wince.
“There was the loneliness of being in a
15-minute act, in a different town every
week, with no one to walk me back to
the digs and cold fish and chips when I
got there.”
Was one tempted to hum Hearts and
Flowers? Not a bit of it. Happily, Miss
Cogan ran on to better days. “At first,
I nearly gave up. I was singing at a place
called the Cumberland Hotel in London
when an Australian golfer whose name
you recall very well asked me to marry
him. I nearly did.
“Then it happened. A wife of one of
the singers in the BBC’s Take It From
Here\ tipped me off that Joy Nicholls,
who was then starring in the show,
was leaving it.
“Joy Nicholls had played a part that
called for several varieties of regional
accent. So I immediately recorded,
well, several varieties of regional ac-
cent .. . . and took the record round my-
self to the producer’s office when he was
out to lunch.”
Short of putting a banana skin under
the star, this sounded the easiest way
one had come across of hitting the big
time. It worked. Alma was called in
for an audition. She was hired. Dick
Bentley was good to her. The team
worked as a team should. There were
meetings on Sundays. It all ran like a
well-wound clock. As Mrs Glum (“a real
misery”) Alma Cogan became a house-
hold goddess in Britain, a favorite with
“Take It From Here” addicts who took
it from here, too.
From there, Alma Cogan had risen
sharply as a singer, developing the warm,
strong voice which wowed Japan with
“He Couldn’t Resist Her With Her
Pocket Transistor,” a machine-age ditty
that topped the Hit Parade there for
months at a stretch. Now, with appear-
ances on the Ed Sullivan Show and in
the Persian Room, New York, her own
hour-long TV show watched by 15 mil-
lion a week in Britain and tours like
the one she is currently making, Alma
Cogan can be said to have got as far
as any British singer can get, which
is to say just a millimetre short of the
final triumph: a huge personal success
in America. ,
Only Acker Bilk had really broken
through to the big time in America, and
I asked Alma Cogan why this was a
tradition, the British star unable to get
past this final hurdle in the battle of
show business. She wasn’t sure, but did
have something to say about Britain’s
failure to make a musical film which
could compete with Hollywood. “Well,
a lot of people in England are kind of
inhibited; you don’t have that wonderful
mixture of go-ahead and sophisticated
performers you do in Hollywood.
Tommy Steele, Tony Newley, they’re
more the boys next door, the cheeky
chappies. We do the kitchen comedies
well, but we haven’t got the Fred
Astaires.”
I mentioned how Shirley Bassey had
complained bitterly about the low stan-
dard of British TV production, and
wondered if Miss Cogan had had similar

cause to grouse.- “Well, Shirley had
trouble with a woman producer who
didn’t get the movement of her arms
into the frame. But she simply arrived
on the night and expected everything
to be all right. I believe in telling my
producer what to do and in preparing
everything well in advance. Really, I
direct myself, my own shows. I’ve never
had a manager to tell me what to wear,
how to present myself. I’ve done it all
myself, made my own image. And people
seem to like it.”
Qhe finds the audience at Andre’s more
- agreeable than that in the Persian
Room. “Here they are really with you
• you make a joke under your breath
and they really catch it in New York
you have to work harder, you have to
get around and look at them. There are
very few cabarets like Andre’s in Lon-
don. One of the few perhaps the
only one at all comparable is The
Talk of the Town. But the British public
is used to seeing artists in a theatre. And
the debs and their boy friends go to the
big Twist places they’re all the rage
in London now.”
Much of Alma Cogan’s time is spent
with a small circle of friends, Tommy
Steele, Tony Newley, the actor Stanley
Baker and his wife, playing charades and
planning for the future. Another friend
is Lionel Bart, the author of the hit
musical “Oliver,” who is preparing a
musical for her about a lady psycho-
analyst who winds up more confused
than her patients. “I read palms and
study astrology,” said the Girl With The
Laugh In Her Voice, looking distinctly
unlike the traditional crone crouched
over a crystal ball in a booth. “I needed
all that when I was singing on variety
tours before I made it.” She doesn’t
need it now.
Philatelists’ Day Out
The high price of small mistakes
By J. C. KAYE
Stamp-collector" are pretty wacky
people. All stamp-collectors know
this. All those bits of paper! All
that enthusiasm! Melbourne, from Oc-
tober 7 to 12 had MIPEX, the Mel-
bourne International Philatelic Exhibi-
tion. It was the first IPEX in Australia’s
history, and it was the first time Mel-
bourne had had clear claim to being
the stamp capital of Australia since a
national exhibition of 1950.
Paying 12s. 6d. for a single admission
(under 16, 35.) stamp people, from
schoolboys to business tycoons, flocked
to the. Lower Town Hall in Swanston
Street, and to the showrooms of Preston
Motors in Russell Street.
In rack after rack of beautifully-
mounted stamps, behind glass and under
fluorescent lights, the fans saw collec-
tions worth £li million. If you asked
why these scraps of gummed paper hap-
pened to be worth that much, the ans-
wer from such men as Jim Purves,
president of the Royal Philatelic Society
of Victoria was clear: “They’re worth
that much because the collectors of the
world agree that they are.” That’s that.
You can't press it any further.
For MIPEX, the Royal Philatelic, and
others among Victoria’s 30 leading stamp
clubs, spent 18 months gathering in of-
ferings from all corners of the world,
this side of the Iron Curtain. Entrants
competed for a silver salver, the cham-
pionship trophy, and for gold, silver-
gilt, silver and bronze medallions bearing
part of the design of a Victorian 6d.
stamp of 1859-61, showing young Queen
Victoria on her throne.
The judges panel of 20 including
one woman, Mrs P. Rock of Sydney
gave' the salver to Dr W. P. Heslop, of
Clifton Hill, Melbourne. His six exhibits
ranged from an Australian collection
with 110 Sydney Views to a fine display
which had, in part, more than 700 of
the first type of Australian stamps (in-
cluding “transfer variety No. 157 in
the 1d.,” the 1857 2d. lithos and “a
vertical pair of Id. on 3d., the lower
stamp of which is without surcharge”).
Gold medals were awarded to V.
Frankenstein, Sydney; Dr Heslop; Dr L.
Abramovich, Pott’s Point, Sydney; E. R.
Gill, Liverpool, England; C. F. Bulley,
Hawthorn East, Melbourne; E. C. Creed,
Malvern, Melbourne; M. C. Stanley,
Wellington, NZ; J. L. Messenger, Godai-
ming, England; R. A. Dubash, Bombay,
India; P C. Pearson, London, England;
and F. W. Hill, Woollahra, Sydney.
MIPEX exhibits came from Britain, the
USA, Canada, New Zealand, South
Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Poland,
Greece, Turkey, Mexico, Haiti and Col-
ombia (South America)- as well as from
all Australian States. One of the finest
shows though not competing for a
prize came from the Postmaster-
General’s Department, which not only
makes and sells stamps, but collects them.
The official PMG collection may one day
be the basis of a National Stamp
Museum.
The golden kernel of the show was at
Preston Motors, where the racks stood
by slowly-revolving, shiny Holden
models, and salesmen behind a screen
tried to sell Chevrolets while the exhibi-
tion took up most of the floor. Preston
Motors had the Court of Honor, with
50 non-competitive displays. At least 20
of the items were worth £3OOO each, and
others were more precious.
Queen of the show was a group of
three stamps printed in Mauritius, in
1857, from locally-made plates, ordered
by the postmaster of the time. He needed
the stamps, it is said, for invitations
from Government House to the better
people of the island. Anyway, the item
was valued at £30,000.
Another rich item was a Spanish
stamp of 1854. It showed the head of
Queen Isabella, double chin and all. Its
value came from the fact that it was
printed in blue when, as a two reales
stamp, it should have been printed in
reddish brown. Mr Purves set the value
of this error at £BOOO. There was a

Business
goes modern
There’s probably been as startling a
change in the last twenty years in
business organisation and methods as
there has in the field of space research.
Twenty years ago it was still acceptable
to think of a clerk as a rusty little man
on a high stool. A salesman was some-
body who called on you. A secretary sat
taking dictation. Personnel selection was
called job interviewing in those far-off
days, and involved a committee or a
succession of interviews with an applicant.
And important discussions, conversations
with legal consequences, had to be fol-
lowed up by a letter to make sure the
points were duly registered.
The recent rapid and sweeping changes
in business methods are a result of the
immense amount of electronic work
developed during World War 11. It’s
taken some while for the techniques of
tele-communication to percolate down
from Government agencies into the big
international firms and thence to smaller,
more individually run companies—but
automated, electronic business methods
are now with us —and to judge from
recent spectacular increases in equipment
sales, they’re here to stay.
Because of major advances in transistor
equipment typists now work from taped
dictation—releasing the boss for other
work, saving his secretary waiting through
his phone calls and appointments.
Speeches to conferences need no longer
be made in person —they can be pre-
recorded. Market research, production
reports, appraisements, interviews with
applicants for jobs, salesmen’s briefings,
all can be kept on tape, and used over
and over again.
A thriving new tertiary industry is the
distribution on rental of information film-
strips, to which firms can put their own
recorded commentary relating what is
seen to their own operations. And many
an executive has got into the habit of
switching on a microphone as he makes
an important phone call, so he has his
own permanent record of what he said.
With the latest battery operated tape
recorders, the executive finds himself
taking his recorder home with him as
well as his brief case.
In all the multifarious daily output of
words in meetings, conferences, surveys,
reports and discussions, the tape recorder
is proving to be the biggest time-saver
since the invention of the typewriter and
the telephone. It is, in point of fact, a
new medium of communication.
And, on the factory floor, in time and
motion study, operatives’ training
schemes, automatic alarm instructions,
noise measurements and music in work
time, the tape recorder is also proving to
be the Works Manager’s best friend.

small alarm on the eve of the show when
one of the guards reported Queen Isa-
bella missing. But she had merely slipped
from her place to behind another sheet
of stamps, and so hearts quietened and
pulses calmed.
The most valuable Australian item
was one of the “inverted swan” stamps
of 1854. The swan was turned upside
down in an error in printing, when one of
two transfers used to make the pattern
was mistakenly used the wrong way
round. The value now is around £2500.
In all, there were 7000 sheets of
stamps on view, a total of around
150,000 individual stamps. Many col-
lectors spent whole days there, now and
then lifting a magnifying glass like a
lorgnette, peering close, or simply stand-
ing off with hands behind back.
As a non-collector, it seemed to me a
good idea to pin Jim Purves down and
try to learn the secret of his great en-
thusiasm. He’s a leading city solicitor
by profession, and took annual leave
to look after MIPEX problems. He told
me that, if I thought of taking up the
game seriously, I shouldn’t hurry into
it, but spend at least six months in one
of the clubs (any except the Women’s
Philatelic Society) to find what suited
my taste and temperament.
I could then decide to specialise in a
country, or era, or series of historic
occasions. I could concentrate on rarities
(which takes a lot of money) or
forgeries, or errors, or perforations
or whatever. I needn’t even collect
stamps, but could give my time to
“postal stationery” such as embossing,
seals, cancellations and so on.
Or, like Mr Purves, I could build
up a lifetime knowledge of papers, inks,
printing methods and other technical
facets, and perhaps become (like him)
the sort of chap consulted by collectors
all over the world. There are many prob-
lems to solve here. What, for instance,
has become of 138 oldtime post-office
numbers, from the 2100 numbers once
allotted to Victorian post-offices? No
one has yet sighted letters marked with
any of the missing 138.
I gather that the stamp world gains in
piquancy, and loses no undue sleep,
from the activities of its forgers, trick-
sters and racketeers. Part of the fun of
the game is in seeing that you’re never
duped.
I turned away from Mr Purves, and
came first to No. 3 of the Court of
Honor St Lucia, Grenada and St
Vincent, shown by P. Jafee, Don Vale,
Victoria. “The St Lucia sheets include
a cover sent from Soufriere to Castries,”
the catalogue said, “at the Id. rate
in 1854, thence to Bordeaux . . . ”
Wouldn’t it be wonderful to care?
Not For Delicate People
“I don't know how Bob Menzies will take it"
By JILLIAN ROBERTSON
The first volume of Xavier Herbert’s
autobiography “Disturbing Ele-
ment”, was published by Cheshire
this month. This will be followed by a
collection of his short stories from Angus
and Robertson. Herbert recently was
splashing white paint on the walls of his
two-roomed cottage at Redlynch, near
Cairns, and dwelling with some satisfac-
tion on the sensation he hopes his auto-
biography will create.
Herbert says that “Disturbing Element”
is the story of his life to the age of 24;
“of my neglected, rejected childhood”.
“A lot of people won’t speak to me
after reading my book”, he said, when
I visited him at Redlynch recently. “But
they’d be stuffy people and I wouldn’t
want to talk to them anyhow. Con-
ventional people will feel a bit delicate
after reading it 1 don’t know how Bob
Menzies will take it.
“My wife Sadie cried after she read
the script which 1 sent to her when she
was in London last year. She knew I’d
exposed my soul; she knew it was a sacri-
fice. But what is the use of writing some-
thing if it isn’t honest?
“In this book I’ve tried to discover
the reality of my existence. It is a re-
vealing and devastating book 1 haven’t
left anything out Most of it is quite
discreditable, especially the parts about
my family they were all bums.
“Writers are all bums, too. Writing,
after all, is just a neurotic form of ex-
pression. I started writing as a way of
getting out of honest work.
“My own life has been much more
interesting than any other character I
could ever think of. You can tell the
truth about yourself, you don’t have to
guess. I started writing my autobi-
ography when Peter Coleman, associate
editor of The Bui letin, said, ‘Why not
write something about yourself?’ ”
Herbert’s experiences start at the be-
ginning of the century in Port Hedland
on the north-west coast of Western Aus-
tralia. He claims his family never wanted
him and that he is the son of a Welsh
gold prospector, turned horse-breaker,
turned railway - engine - driver. His
mother, he says, was the daughter of
a phoney Irish nobleman, sea-
farer, turned camel-driver.
“When some people read my new book
they will accuse me of sensationalism”,
he said. “They will say ‘Herbert is after
the dough’. But I’m not. I don’t want
to own anything but my soul, that’s why
I gave the house to Sadie.
“I doubt if the English will like it.
You have got to realise that an Austra-
lian writer or any writer belonging to a
small country must be satisfied with the
success in his own country. The reason
why Patrick White and Morris West are
successful overseas is that they write
about things objectively and they write
about other countries.
“My first book, ‘Capricornia’, had an
essentially Australian quality. The people
overseas go for it because it is a sort of
denunciation of Australia. The English
were very shocked because they always
thought Australia was a decent, clean
country. ‘Capricornia’ is always popular
behind the Iron Curtain because it is
useful propaganda. It has kept us over
the years, bought our home, fed us.
“Even so I’ve never sold a short story
overseas and I’ve tried often. It is strange
because the Mitchell Library in Sydney
has bought the manuscripts of my short
stories. The National Library in Can-
berra bought the manuscript of ‘Capri-
cornia’.
“Sadie looks after all that side
collecting all my junk, scripts, letters and
everything. Most women aren't kind to
their husbands but Sadie is to me”.
Herbert’s marriage happily survived
years of sleeping in the open air or in
rented houses until he bought the Red-
lynch house nine years ago so that Mrs
Herbert would be happy while he went
walkabout.
He does most of his writing in a rusty
railway fettlers’ hut up in the mountains
near his home. We visited the hut to-
gether, climbing past the sugarcane fields.
Herbert sadly pointed out where the
trees had been burnt down by farmers
anxious to increase their sugarcane acre-
age. At last in the thick of the rain
forest we came to the hut.
“I have very powerful lungs and heart”,

AMOCO AUSTRALIA PTY, LIMITED
There’s a fallacy current among users of furnace oil,
industrial fuel oils and distillates that they are all alike.
In the factor of pour point alone, there are vast differences
between fuel oils. A fuel with low pour point will give
better atomisation at the burner and thus big savings
on pre-heating costs. A factor such as this can often be
overlooked when buying fuel oil on a “price” basis.
Amoco, too, are selling fuel oils at very competitive prices,
but being acutely aware of the problems, we have made
an extensive study of fuel oil needs and its supply to
Australian users. Our Technical Staff and Laboratory are
ready to ensure you get the right fuel to do the job.

he explained. “Every day I run, some-
times five miles, up the mountain. After
physical exhaustion, thoughts come to me
brilliantly.
“When the mango fruiting season
comes it lasts about five weeks I
always write a lot, travelling to the trees
I know like a flying fox and sitting be-
neath to do some writing while I gorge.
I’ve often thought of writing about liter-
ary inspiration on mangos”.
Although he wrote “Disturbing Ele-
ment” in the mountains the germ of the
idea was born over a bottle of wine.
“At home I get on the plonk”, he said.
“I like drinking but I don’t smoke now,
I used to smoke 60 cigarettes a day.
Sadie always brings out the bottle at four

tion comes inspiration.
“Once you know what you want to
write you can write exactly what you
want to if you take enough time. Writing
on the spur of the moment is bad”.
Since he finished “Disturbing Element”
15 months ago, Herbert has been relearn-
ing organic chemistry, flying aeroplanes,
building a garden shed and looking for
aboriginal caves with a friend, artist
Percy Trezise.
“Percy pilots the flying ambulance, and
he can tell where the caves are on the
lie of the land”, he said. “He photo-
graphs the caves, lectures about them.
He likes being in the limelight. I don’t.
I never let on that I’m a writer when I
go out.
“However, the Herberts aren’t great
people for going out. But because Sadie
and I are both aerial minded we go to
Flying Club dances in the hangar at the
airport. There- is always a band and lots
of booze. Last week they had a fancy
dress. After one of the wildest nights I
fell off my bike three times and finally
hit a bullock”.
Herbert said he had escaped death
many times and had recently written a
short story “My Thousandth Death”.
“I look forward to my death”, he said.
“I will know when I’m going to die. All
our bodies wear out in some way. When
I get really sick I’ll know that I’m going
to die. Then, like I have done so many
times, I will go to the wilderness. I am
going to die alone in the bush”.
The End of Borroloola
The highest average age and the lowest birthrate in Australia
By M. H. ELLIS
The death of Roger Jose seems to
spell the end to the claim of Bor-
roloola, on the McArthur River
in the Northern Territory, to be a town
of refuge for human relics of the past.
It was always a strange place. Before
World War I it was a sort of caravan-
serai where when the six-monthly boat
came in the teams gathered in dozens
on the flat beside the river a river
in which the crocodiles were enormous
and the tales about them ever more mo-
mentous. The boat would come. The
teams would move out to the Headingly
Track where wild blacks still roved, to
the Barkly Tableland or up to Tanum-
birini and the Four Archers Country, leav-
ing Borroloola silent and solitary save
for the police station with its library
(of interest mainly to the white ants
which ate it entirely), its cheerful chain-
gang of murderers, and the little store
which served as a gathering place for the
few inhabitants.
By the end of World War I, Bor-
roloola had receded into itself. When
the boat came in, there were few to
greet it. The gold rushes of the Gulf
Country were over, the inland towns
were moribund, the railway to Cloncurry
had focused traffic there that used to
come to the Gulf.
The boat came in only irregularly.
The main link with civilisation was the
mailman who threaded his way along
a red line in the grass from the OT via
Nutjvood and Tanumbirini every six
weeks. When I called in there in the
winter of 1924, the “hotel” had become
almost completely buried in mango trees,
its host had passed us on the Kilgour
on his way to the Ranken races several
hundred miles away, and it took a lot
of cooee-ing to raise even one inhabitant,
though there were in fact seven, not in-
cluding a .Chinese whom good white
Australians refused to count.
The seven were, however, remarkable.
Their doyen was Charles Scrutton who
had been second in charge of the Jardine
expedition to Cape York with cattle in
1865 he lived until near the century
in 1928. In 1924 he was a spry old
character in his nineties who could still
chase a chicken for dinner, and draw a
picture of himself which w'ould have
w'on a prize in a contemporary art show.
Then there were the two Lynotts, the
elder, Tom, reaching his eighties. He
and his brother had been famous team-
sters who had pioneered the sites of
many a north-western town such as
Winton, on which they made their camps
in the days of the ’7os before F. C.
Urquhart, balladist and Black Police
commander, had taken the first wheeled
vehicle over the Selwyn Ranges and
founded the fort at Urandangie.
Then there was Freddie Blittner,

fine experiment in survival. When I
came upon them they were out of flour
and were eating lily roots. They were
out of beer and rum, but were drinking
a lethal concoction of their own of
local origin. It smelt strongly of eucalyp-
tus and had the potency of overproof
gelignite.
By the time I sighted the place again
in 1946, progress had reared its ugly head.
The aborigines, in the raw with their
smoke-talk and hand-talk and local hail-
ing cry—the lu-lu-lu of the Roman legion-
ary had disappeared. There was no
chain-gang of sleek savages with no gar-
ments to lose save their neck-to-ankle
chains, which they regarded as the equi-
valent of the DSO, awarded by a grate-
ful Government, and proud to describe
their murders of their spouses:
“Yowai, boss, me bin killem that one
dead-feller; me bin killem dead tw'o
feller lubra belong me.”
A sausage balloon on the airstrip
mourned for the packhorse mailman in
the wind and there was a young police-
man who counted less than the old-time
one because he had a wife.
There was pedal wireless and an an-
thropologist who was said to be mad,
living with his wife somewhere in the
environs and studying aboriginal lore
among remnant indigenes who had lost
all the lore their race had ever had.
The great Freddy Blittner was still there.
So was Tom Heavey, unfamiliar without
his beard. But the Lynotts and old
Charles Scrutton had long gone. One or
two fresh initiates had arrived, including
Roger Jose, who at a mere 50-and-a-bit
was regarded by the old hands with some
doubt, since he was openly consorting in
marriage or otherwise with a lubra. He
was not then on Borrolooia proper, but
had a “farm” on the Barkly Tableland
Road where 1 found him, stripped to es-
sentials in clothing, working in the field
beside his native lady.
He had none of the patriarchal charac-
teristics now' reported as distinguishing
him neither a white beard, nor long
staff to walk w'ith like Moses as he
seems to have had at 69 when he died a
few days ago in picturesque squalor.
He was, however, well soaked in an-
cient philosophy and Bible and Masonic
lore. He claimed to be a nephew of
Arthur Jose, the "Times” correspondent
and Australian historian, and admitted
to being a son of a noted Dean of Ade-
laide who had come to Australia as a
surveyor, gone to China as a lay mis-
sionary and finished up high in the
Church hierarchy in South Australia.
He seems to have been the last of the
true Borroloolans of the olden vintage.
SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
Unanswered Questions
About the Gulf Stream
The Gulf Stream has been for so
long an object of legend that it
may come as a shock to many
readers to be told that a strengthening of
this great ocean current would be more
likely to make Britain colder than warmer.
This, at any rate, is the view expressed
by the American oceanographer, Dr H.
Stommel. The form of his question, and
therefore the answer, appears to have
been carefully chosen to illustrate the
point that changes in large-scale systems
affecting climate would not always work
out as might at first sight be supposed.
There are, moreover, a number of un-
answered questions about the Gulf
Stream, one of which is a subject of
argument at the present time.
The first point that needs to be made
about the Gulf Stream is that it does
not come primarily from the Gulf of
Mexico, after which it was named. More
of it comes from the Caribbean and, if
traced further back, is seen to be part
of a vast clockwise circulation of surface
water around the northern Atlantic basin.
The circulation appears to be driven
largely by prevailing winds. At first sight,
it might be thought that the rate of flow
should be roughly equal at all points on
the circuit; in particular, that the return
south-west flow on the east side of the
Atlantic should be as clearly marked as
the north-west flow on the west side. In
fact, it is both slower and more diffuse.
The explanation in general terms is that
movements of ocean water, unlike those
of air, are constrained by the land masses
that border the oceans; and that the
rotation of the earth about its axis leads
to a lack of symmetry.
The Gulf Stream proper off the
east coast of the United States before it
degenerates off the Newfoundland Banks
into what is better described as the North
Atlantic drift is from 20 to 40 miles
wide, up to 2000 ft. deep or more, and
moves at up to four miles an hour.
Detailed knowledge began with a survey
carried out by six ships during June,
1950, under the United States Navy
Hydrographic Office. This covered the
1200 miles from Cape Hatteras, North
Carolina, to the longitude of the Grand
Banks. But, before this, there had been a
more limited investigation by F. C.
Fuglister and V. Worthington of the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,
England, which had brought to notice the
existence of meanders.
These and later observations up to
1960 have made it clear that the Gulf
Stream not only follows a sinuous course,
but that its course changes over periods
of the order of days in a way suggestive
of a slowly swimming snake.
It used to be thought that below the
Gulf Stream, after it had left the con-
tinental shelf, there was a slower, but
still well defined, current moving in the
opposite direction. But the most recent
observations made from Woods Hole are
said to show that the stream east of Cape
Hatteras extends to the bottom of the
ocean without reversing direction
This bears on a scientific argument
which is now in progress. With so much
detailed information to go on, there has
been understandable competition to
account for the course and behavior of
the observed meanders. A year ago Pro-
fessor G. F. Carrier and A. R Robin-
son, of Harvard University, published a
theory which offered an explanation in
purely dynamic terms. They considered
the primary current to be fairly uniform
but unstable,
More lately a rival theory has been
published, by B. A. Warren of the Woods
Hole Institution.
Quite simply, he noticed that the few
long and well-determined paths which
had been observed by direct methods east
of Cape Hatteras were such as to sug-
gest that the primary factor might be
merely the topography of the ocean bed.
This would have been absurd, as he
admits, but for recent evidence that the
flow may extend to the bottom.
Returning now to Dr Stommel’s
question, it is accepted that the
more friendly climate enjoyed by
north-west Europe compared with
Labrador must be related to the difference
in temperature between the cold and
south-flowing Labrador Current and that
of its neighbor, the Gulf Stream. Though
overrated in the past, the effect of the
Gulf Stream on European climate is not
entirely legend.
Dr Stommel’s question was not, how-
ever, about this, but about the effect of
an increase in its rate of flow. In these
terms, he argued that the Gulf Stream
acted incidentally as a barrier, limiting
the northwards movement of warm sur-
face water from further south. This is
as may be. A more substantial point is
that talk of changes in an enduring sense
is misconceived, unless as a part of wider
and still little understood changes affect-
ing the climate of the earth as a whole.

India’s Cabinet Shake-Up
Six Down - And More To Go?
From BALRAM TANDON in New Delhi
Mr Nehru’s
effort to re-
vitalise the
ruling Congress
Party of India is
running into trouble.
As Members of
Parliament leave
New Delhi for their
distant homes after
a critical session,
the signs are that if the Prime Minister
does not follow up the Kamaraj “party
before power” Plan with firm consis-
tency a quality for which he has not
been particularly distinguished—the pre-
sent buoyant mood of the nation will
slide back into despondency.
The theory of the Plan, named after
its sponsor, Mr Kamaraj, is that unless
there is a shake-up in the regional gov-
ernments making compact cabinets,
weeding out corrupt and high-handed
politicians, public confidence in the Con-
gress Party, which has been in power
ever since India got her independence
in 1947, will be difficult to revive.
When a special convention of the
Party considered in August Mr Kamaraj’s
programme to capture public imagination
by a reversion to the old days of plain
living and high thinking, the most im-
pressive speech in support of it was
made by Mr S. K. Patil, the Food
Minister.
Mr Nehru went into action by drop-
ping six members of his own central
Cabinet. Among them was Mr Patil.
The departing Ministers are expected
to go back to grass-roots work in the
countryside, helping to enlighten the
masses about the Government’s demo-
cratic socialist programme. But within
six-weeks of leaving office Mr Patil has
launched a thundering campaign against
the Kamaraj Plan.
He claims that he is really helping to
implement the Plan “in the true Kamaraj
spirit”, but that mere diversion of talent
from the Government to the Party will
not work miracles, and that the only
result so far has been to demoralise the
Administration.
When Mr Patil spoke up for the Plan
at the Party convention he called Nehru
the “leader of leaders”, and declared,
“We are ready to do anything at the
leader’s bidding, if necessary to the point
of self-effacement. Let the country know
that Congressmen are not hypnotised by
power.” Now he has insinuated that the
Plan is being used to get rid of unwanted
leaders like Finance Minister Morarji R.
Desai and himself.
Mr Patil is a champion of free enter-
prise. He got his job in the Cabinet for his
work in organising the 1957 elections.
Mr Nehru looked upon him as an out-
standing trouble-shooter. His influence
in the Party is considerable. But his
recent statements are widely regarded as
first salvoes in what may become a con-
certed “Rightist” rebellion within the
Party against Nehru’s leadership.
In the States of Gujarat and Uttar
Pradesh, where the Chief Ministers have
been changed, there is bitterness. The
new Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, the
country's most populous State (75 mil-
lions) and Nehru's home province, is a
woman, Mrs Sucheta Kripalani. She was
a compromise candidate elected by the
State Congress Party after an acrimonious
squabble, and in one respect a curious
choice because her husband, Mr J. B.
Kripalani, is an Opposition stalwart in
Parliament and a fierce critic of the
Nehru Government.
But the impact of the Patil revolt has
been felt most in the States where the
Kamaraj Plan has still to be implemented.
If, instead of doing constructive work,
disgruntled politicians like Mr Patil cam-
paign against the Plan, it is feared in
Congress circles that the Party may break
up into two major factions one clearly
Rightist and the other a collection of
Centralists and Leftists under Mr Nehru.
Mr Nehru is, however, playing the
situation skilfully. The new Finance
Minister of India, Mr T. T. Krishnama-
chari, has persuaded the Cabinet to
modify drastically two measures which
have made the Government unpopular.
These are the Compulsory Deposits
Scheme, meant to siphon public savings,
and the Gold Control Order, meant to
unearth family gold hoards for defence
-needs. These were the stern cures for
economic and social ills prescribed by
Mr Desai.
At least ten thousand processions were
organised in various parts of the country
to protest against these measures. More
than 15,000 goldsmiths courted arrest
and about 100 of them are reported to
have committed suicide. The Govern-
ment lost three key by-elections.
The Communist and Socialist opposi-
tion has now been robbed of this dis-
content to exploit, for the scrapping of
the measures has gladdened the public.
As Food Minister, Mr Patil, on the

other hand, resisted controls. He relied
much on importing American wheat,
giving rise to the wry joke that “among
the best wheat-producing regions of
India is the United States”. Now that he
is rid of Mr Patil, Mr Nehru will find
it easier to listen to the demand for
effective controls to check profiteering
and the black market in food grains.
The Prime Minister is anxious to
demonstrate progress towards the Con-
gress Party's brand of socialism (which
his daughter, Indira Gandhi, has defined
as a mixture of socialism with demo-
cracy, humanism and Gandhism) un-
trammelled by the factional opposition
which Mr Patil and Mr Desai quietly
generated inside the Cabinet.
At the same time Mr Nehru’s new
team is anxious to be understood sympa-
thetically in the West. Mr Krishna-
machari (who, in an earlier term as
Finance Minister, imposed many bur-
dens on Big Business though he is a
very rich man himself with aristocratic
tastes) is apparently eager now to dispel
the old suspicion that he is an insidious
Socialist. He has rejected an Opposition
demand for nationalisation of the banks.
But at various levels in the Congress
Party there are disgruntled elements,
some of them quite powerful, who see
everything increasingly in terms of a
showdown between Right and Left. The
Prime Minister's real challenges are yet
to come. The reimposition of food con-
trols will be a test. And Mr Patil is a
name to be kept in mind, (ofns.)
Masters of
The Inner
Temple
Vnprofessional conduct?
From NEIL KELLY in London
HThe forthcoming “trial” of the Attorney-
General, Sir John Hobson, QC, by
his fellow lawyers is heightening public
disquiet about the workings of Britain’s
legal system. Sir John will appear before
the Masters of the Inner Temple, a pro-
fessional tribunal, on October 21 to
answer allegations of unprofessional con-
duct in his handling of the Enahoro Case.
No chief law officer of a British
Government has ever before faced an in-
quiry of this nature. Chief Enahoro, an
Opposition leader in Nigeria, was de-
ported from Britain to stand trial on
charges of treason. He was gaoled for
fifteen years.

The Attorney-General’s arraignment
climaxes a year of unprecedented criti-
cism of the working of the law in Bri-
tain. The handling of the Enahoro case
was one of several which have aroused
public concern. The cases of Stephen
Ward, “Lucky” Gordon and John Edge-
combe, of the imprisoned journalists
Foster and Mulholland and of American
scientist Doctor Soblen, who suicided in
a British prison, were others.
Labor Leader Harold Wilson had the
Enahoro case in mind when he attacked
the Government recently for “blurring
their quasi-judicial duties with their
party preoccupations”.
The Minister chiefly responsible for
the decision to deport the Chief was
Home Secretary Henry Brooke.
HPhe Attorney-General became involved
because, as the Government’s lawyer,
his duty was to put the case in the courts
for Enahoro’s return. It is in this capacity
that he is now facing a charge of un-
professional conduct made by Reginald
Paget, QC, Labor MP for Northamp-
ton, who was involved in the legal and
political fight to prevent Enahoro’s de-
portation. His complaint arises from
an affidavit sworn by Home Secretary
Brooke which was submitted by the
Attorney-General to the High Court on
April 25. In this affidavit, Brooke said
he had received “satisfactory assurances”,
from the Nigerian authorities that the
Chief would be allowed the counsel of
his choice at his trial.
However, it later emerged that Brooke
knew all the time that the Nigerian
Government would not admit Mr Dingle
Foot, QC, and Mr Noel Gratiaen, QC,
the counsel Enahoro wanted. When
questioned in the House of Commons,
Brooke admitted that the Attorney-
General also had known of Nigeria’s ban
on these lawyers before he presented the
affidavit to the High Court.
After hearing these details, the disci-
plinary committee of the Four Inns of
Court decided a primci facie case had
been made against Sir John Hobson. The
masters of the bench who will hear the
charges are a self electing, self govern-
ing body of senior barristers and judges.
The Attorney-General himself is one of
them. The benchers control the Four
Inns of Court to which all barristers and
judges belong and which derive their
name from the mediaeval public houses
where lawyers foregathered and talked.
They have the powers of a trade union
in a closed shop, and they can admit,
suspend and expel.
The hearing of the case against Sir
John Hobson will resemble normal court
procedure. He will appear personally, al-
though he is not obliged to do so, and will
be assisted by another QC. Witnesses

may be called to give evidence but can-
not be compelled to attend. No oath is
taken in this professional court, which
sits in private. A guilty verdict could
lead to a reprimand, a fine, suspension
or disbarment.
Sir John’s political and professional
future would undoubtedly be affected
unfavorably if the verdict should go
against him. His resignation from the
Government would appear to be inevit-
able, and probably the Home Secretary
would have to go, too.
Chief Enahoro’s deportation deeply
disturbed the conscience of Britain. Poli-
ticians of all parties found the Govern-
ment decision ran sharply against the
British tradition of granting asylum to
all political refugees. Moreover, his plea
for asylum would have succeeded had
he been a foreigner. It failed because
he was the subject of a Commonwealth
country. A nineteenth century Act of
Parliament withholds privilege of politi-
cal asylum from Commonwealth subjects
but confers it upon foreigners.
The Government was also accused of
acting dishonorably in the manner of the
Chief’s arrest. He had been living in
Ireland and came to Britain only for a
brief visit to discuss the situation in
Nigeria. He had, in fact, received some
sort of official assurance that he was safe
from arrest or deportation before cross-
ing the Irish Sea.
Dropping
The Pilot
Who loves Adenauer?
By TERENCE PRITTIE
On October 15, Konrad Adenauer,
West German Chancellor for the
last 14 years and a father-figure
to most of his people, will step down.
It will be the most significant leave-
taking of a German Chancellor since
that of Bismarck more than 60 years
ago, whom “Punch” showed leaving the
“ship of state,” while the moustachioed,
sardonic face of Kaiser William II
watched with quiet satisfaction from the
ship's rail above. Bismarck, like Aden-
auer, believed that he had years of use-
ful work left in him; he quitted the
political stage with a thoroughly bad
grace.
Adenauer’s departure has two features
which distinguish it from that of Bis-
marck. He is going because public
opinion turned against him, whereas Bis-
marck went because his Emperor loathed
him. Adenauer’s departure, too, has been
mooted for a period of over two years,
and has been very definitely expected
during the last nine months; Bismarck’s
departure, which “Punch” called “The
Dropping of the Pilot,” came as a com-
plete surprise.
There is a third difference. Bismarck
retired when Germany was in the first
flush of its imperial power. His retire-
ment left a gap in the ranks of the
policy-makers but it also left a German
nation which was brimming over with
a self-confidence which often bordered
on arrogance. Adenauer’s departure will
not leave a significant gap at the top,
and there should be no repetition of what
occurred after Bismarck a period in
which German statesmanship became
totally subservient to the erratic whims
and inspirations of the Kaiser. On Oc-
tober 15 Ludwig Erhard will take over
where Adenauer left off, with the guide-
lines of West German policy already
laid down, firm and straight. But the
German nation is in a different frame
of mind from that of the 1890 s.
rule has been patriarchal
and has verged on the authoritarian.
His authority and his capacity for taking
“lonely decisions” has sometimes been ini-
mical to his subordinates, but most
Germans welcomed it at least during
the early post-war years and have
only come to question it by slow degrees.
The first effect of Adenauer’s depart-
ure may well be to increase German un-
certainty of mind. Deprived of their
father-figure they will take to re-
cover confidence. Doubts and worries
have already begun to show about a
possible change in foreign policy, about
Germany’s relationship with her allies,
about the intentions of some of them
(the British in particular are increasingly
regarded as lukewarm over German re-
unification), about the efficacy of the
European Community. These doubts
have brought the Federal Foreign Min-
ister, Gerhard Schroeder, under heavy
fire from the Christian Democratic
Party’s “old guard” men like the
ex-Ministers for Foreign Affairs and De-
fence, von Brentano and Strauss.
The Erhard administration will inevit-
ably face teething troubles. They will be
primarily concerned with the waning of
public confidence and the unco-operative
postures of men like Brentano and
Strauss. The teething troubles may last
a few months, but there are already in-
dications that it should not be longer than
that. Schroeder has shown, in his talks
with American and French statesmen,
that he is unaffected by unconstructive
criticism and intends to go ahead with
his plans for searching for a more con-
structive and mobile foreign policy.

The Denning Report As Literature
“One can hardly put it down"
By GEOFFREY WILMOT
TT is ironical and sad that the British Prime Minister; Mr Harold
A Macmillan, should he resigning from office because of ill-health.
Since the day when he obstinately refused to let the British Government
be brought down by the actions of two tarts, public sympathy has
turned in his favor. The Denning Report, in the three weeks since its
publication, has gone far to restore confidence in public life; and has
already quashed the glib verdict of “whitewashing 7 which so many
people gave before they had read it.
One reason for the report’s success is
its great readability. One can hardly put
it down. This is due to its style and
presentation as much as to its subject
matter. Its short simple sentences are
supremely lucid. They are hampered
neither by textbook rules of prose writing
nor by traditions of official obscurity and
pomposity. Popular phrases appear with-
out even inverted commas to dissociate
the author. Mr Profumo, for example,
told the Chief Whip that he used to go
to Stephen Ward’s flat sometimes in the
evening to get a giggle, to meet some
young people and to have drinks before
dinner. Lord Denning has a way of
rounding off his paragraphs with a short
sentence, not infrequently beginning with
“And”.
“And Mr Profumo said he would do
so” (go and see the Chief Whip).
“And we have no machinery to deal
with it.” (Moral misbehavior by a
Minister.)
“The story ends, as it began, with
him.” (Stephen Ward.)
This technique quickens the pace and
heightens the drama. Lord Denning has
an extraordinary feeling for drama. The
report begins with short profiles of the
dramatis personae. The chapter head-
ings could be those of a book by Simenon
or lan Fleming. This is Chapter Xl:
(i) The Sunday Pictorial Abandon
One Story and Accept Another.
(ii) The Daily Express has a Striking
First Page.
(iii) The Attorney - General is Con-
sulted.
(iv) The Sunday Pictorial Publish
Stephen Ward’s Story.
(v) The ‘"Darling” Letter is Handed
Back.
Lord Denning also has a novelist’s
sympathy with his characters. None, it
is true, for Stephen Ward, who emerges
as an unstable, garrulous, name-dropping,
vicious Communist sympathiser; yet even
he is described as being an osteopath of
very considerable skill.
He certainly has some sympathy for
Christine. He brings out very clearly
how Ward destroyed the child from
Wraysbury. Shortly after she came to
London at the age of 16 Ward picked
her up in a nightclub where she was
earning her living by “just walking
around with no clothes on”, as she her-
self put it. She went to live with him.
“She ran away from him many times, but
she always went back. He seemed to
control her.” He passed her on to other
men, often men of rank and position.
Then he introduced her to the drug
Indian hemp and she became an addict.
She met colored men who trafficked in
it and she went to live with them. In two
years her ruin was complete.
Not many people have sympathised
with Christine. Men who saw her pass
on her way to court would raise a bawdy
cheer, but the middle-aged women who
mobbed her outside the court house felt
a primitive hatred, jealousy and fear
that caused them to keep all their insults
and rotten tomatoes for her. There were
none for Stephen Ward, who was merely
an object of curiosity. It is strange how
women, no matter what the circum-
stances, always blame the woman.
Yet Christine, at the time of her brief
affair with Profumo, was only 18. No
doubt she still had a freshness that made
the 46-year-old Minister feel young
again. The story bears out the conclusion
that Profumo did not think of her, nor
did she think of herself, as a tart. In the
box at the Ward trial she still strongly
denied that she was a prostitute, although
by that time there could be no doubt
about it. But at the earlier stage one
could perhaps be forgiven for thinking
that she was merely a particularly co-
operative popsy. Profumo did not even
pay her in a commercial way. He gave
her presents, scent and the like, until one
day she spun him a yarn about her poor
mother. He then thought, so he told
Lord Denning, that this was a polite way
of asking for payment for her services,
so he gave her £2O. Even so, it would
seem that she w 7 as working at less than
union rates.
For Profumo himself one feels that
Lord Denning has a residual respect.

He is called Mister Profumo throughout
the report; whereas it is Ward or Stephen
Ward, Christine Keeler or just Christine.
It is pointed out that he had a dis-
tinguished war record and a distinguished
record of service to his country as a
member of the Government. But the
greatest sympathy is reserved for Mrs
Profumo, who, equally with the Prime
Minister, fellow ministers and Pro-
fumo’s legal advisers, was deceived about
the nature of her husband’s relations
with Christine Keeler and believed the
statement of March 22, 1963, in which
he told the House of Commons that his
'elations with Christine Keeler had never
been improper. By June he knew that
the truth would out, and told her all
on the first evening of their holiday in
Venice. Then, according to Lord Den-
ning, she said to him, “Oh, darling, we
must go home now just as soon as we
can and face up to it”.
Lord Denning was also clearly im-
pressed by her belief that if she could
have had a talk with her husband before
he was whisked off to the House in the
middle of the night, to be present while
some of his colleagues drafted the state-
ment that he was to read to the House
next morning, he would have told her
the truth then, and therefore would
never have lied to the House. But they
were both “groggy” with the sleeping
pills that they had taken, and Profumo
sat in a daze in the next room while his
colleagues drafted the statement.
Not that he was at all dissociated
from the statement, for they all knew
how extremely damaging it would be if
it could be proved false. On this as on
earlier occasions, they asked him re-
peatedly, “Did you or didn’t you?” At
first they were sceptical, but in the face
of his dogged denials and of his readiness
to sue publications that mentioned the
rumor, they ended by accepting his
word. It seems strangely gullible to
believe that anyone could frequent some-
one like Christine Keeler (whose photo-
graph as a model girl of unmistakable
calling had by this time appeared in the
British papers) for any but one purpose,
especially as he had written a letter to
her, beginning “Darling”, which was
known to be in the possession of the
“Sunday Pictorial” but which no one
asked to see. But at least this gullibility
is the less startling in view of the fact
that Mrs Profumo was also deceived. It
is a matter of common observation that
people tend to believe what they want to
believe.
T ord Denning criticises Profumo’s
" colleagues, not so much for being
gullible, as for mistaking the important
point. They thought the important thing
was whether or not Profumo had slept
with Christine, whereas the judge thinks
they should have asked themselves
whether his conduct had been such that
any reasonable person would believe that
he had done so. A denial, even if true,
would not have checked the rumors or
restored confidence in the integrity of
Ministers because many people would
have remained unconvinced.
That confidence has now been re-
stored by Lord Denning's very lucidity.
He demonstrates to one’s complete satis-
faction that none of her Majesty’s
Ministers, other than Profumo, could be
found to have any connection with the
activities with which rumor had associ-
ated them. There were horrible orgiastic
parties and disgusting practices, but
Ministers were not involved. Similarly
the report is a vindication of the Security
Service, which is shown to have been
very much on the ball. Ward met the
Soviet Naval Attache in January, 1961,
and the Security Service was on to it at
once. One of its officers interviewed
Ward the following June, and Ward,
though making no secret of his sympathy
with Russia, promised co-operation. A
month later he told the security officer
that Ivanov had asked to find out when
the United States was going to give the
Germans atomic weapons.
The service knew also about Profumo’s


visits to Ward’s flat as soon as they
began, and in August, 1961, they got Sir
Norman Brook, then Secretary of the
Cabinet, to warn Profumo against the
association, because Ivanov was a friend
of Ward’s (but in Lord Denning’s view
he was not Christine’s lover). At that
stage the Security Service did not know
that Profumo was Christine’s lover, they
thought that he, too, was merely a friend
of Ward’s. They put a stop to that affair
unwittingly. For after Sir Norman
Brook's visit, that very afternoon, in fact,
Profumo wrote the “Darling” letter,
cancelling his appointment with her and
saying that blast it, he had to go away
and would not be able to see her for
some time. He meant it to be the end,
and he maintains that it was.
The Security Service did not know of
the amorous association until January,
1963, well over a year after it had
ceased. But by that time it did not
interest them, for it involved no security
risk. Not only was it all over, but
Ivanov, who would have made it a
security risk, had long since gone home
having got wind that inquiries were
being made about him. Far from these
facts being disturbing, it is reassuring to
know that security officers do not
pry into people’s private lives unless
absolutely necessary.
The police had more interest in
morals, but only in so far as these contra-
vened the law. It was because they were
on the ball that Ward, frantic to stave
off a prosecution, went to the Prime
Minister’s Private Secretary and blew
the gaff on Profumo—hoping that the
Government would somehow call the
police off him in order to save itself'.
Lord Denning finds that owing to one
breakdown in co-ordination, the police
did not interview Christine Keeler when
they should have done.
Who then, asks Lord Denning, was to
blame? Profumo, of course, and
Ministers for failing to deal adequately
with a situation that affected confidence
in the integrity of public life. But, above
all, he blames the fact that “scandalous
information about well-known people has
become a marketable commodity”. The
scandal developed when Christine, find-
ing herself in the news as because of
the Edgecombe trial, found also that her
story was worth big money. Then
rumor piled on rumor, spreading by
word of mouth, and in print overseas,
involving more and more people. Lord
Denning looks to the Press Council to
do something about it. But there seems
more hope in the lesson learned that
public men, though no worse than they
used to be, are now particularly vulner-
able, and that it therefore “behoves
them, even more than ever, to give no
cause for scandal”.
LETTERS TO THE
EDITOR
“VICIOUS DIATRIBE"
Sir,
In the Victorian Legislative Assembly
on September 24 the Deputy-Leader of
the Opposition, Mr Lovegrove (member
for Fitzroy) said the Government was
responsible for the congestion in Fitzroy
and other inner suburbs and for the
failure adequately to clear slums.
The Chief Secretary, Mr Rylah,
described Mr Lovegrove’s speech as a
“vicious diatribe”. It had been prompted
by a scurrilous attack on Fitzroy in a
June issue of The Bulletin. “And I
agree he had something to complain
about. Because of the article, I asked for
a full report from the police, which
largely refuted the article and showed
that things were not so bad as painted.
Half the trouble came from people living
outside the area.”
We early and older citizens of this
area sadly deplore the vice conditions
that exist. The flotsam and jetsam of
migrants found their mecca here in Fitz-
roy, which was a fine and decent suburb
for the honest, clean-living man or
woman years ago. Blame, too, greedy
landlords for their rotten, slum-like build-
ings, which attracted ill-assorted charac-
ters from Melbourne and environs. The
stamping out of the brothels from the
notorious “Little Lon” years ago drove
these inhabitants and their clan to such
a suburb as Fitzroy.

PATRICK WHITE
Sir,
Your Sydney correspondent writing on
“Patrick White and the Sino-Soviet Split”
(5/10/63) is quite wrong when he
suggests that Marxist critics of Patrick
White's work like myself might be secret
sympathisers of the “Peking line” just
because we do not like his novels. I am
no more a secret sympathiser of that
line than is your editor, Mr Peter Hast-
ings, who doesn’t seem fond of Mr
White’s work either, perhaps for dif-
ferent reasons.
I am convinced that I was perfectly
consistent in criticising Patrick White
who in his novels is something of a
Nietzschean, a pessimist and a mystic.
I also stated my opposition on principle
to his excessive inwardness which is not
only a method but a philosophy con-
nected with his view of the outer world
as irrational and meaningless.
However, 1 would be happy to co-
operate with Mr White in any project
designed to advance the cause of inter-
national friendship and peace.

REPUBLICAN PARTY
Sir,
I have been shocked at the way that
“Batman” dared introduce the Australian
Republican Party to the Australian
public (The Bulletin, 28/9/63, page
29).
It is true that Mr Robert Harvey
Grainger, our West Melbourne candidate,
has been the first Republican candidate
to, more or less, break through, but we
believe that the 12,000-odd votes he
received would have been many more if
the so-called democratic Australian Press
(in reality London-controlled) had not
boycotted him.
One more thing: the Australian Re-
publican Party is not only “around Mel-
bourne”. We have active branches in
Hobart, Darwin and Sydney. Members
of the Party are also active in Perth,
Brisbane and several places in South
Australia.
F. REALE

ALF CONLON
Sir,
As two people who knew Alf Conlon
during the last years of his life may we
put forward our view of him? We feel
that your contributor (28/9/63) has
assessed him by standards which Alf Con-
lon would not have accepted and has
missed the essential value of his work.
He was indeed vastly interested in power
(and vastly entertained by it); he spent
a lot of his time trying to influence events
and institutions by the use of it. But
power was his hobby, not his life.
He was primarily a teacher whose work
was to free people from self-imposed
limitations, and it was while doing
that he gained the friendship the
numerous important people you have
mentioned, and also the gratitude and
affection of very many humble people
whom he helped unstintingly. Alf Con-
lon himself recognised this as his greatest
contribution. The “heroic years” didn’t
seem very important to him in his later
life.
His grasp of essentials and his ability
to communicate them seem more
pertinent to us than his success or failure
in manipulating power.

REVIEWS
TELEVISION
The Wrong Thing
The fate of the Flintstones
By FRANK ROBERTS
Indonesia Today. Channel 7. Sydney.
The Right Thing. Channel 2. Sydney.
Pick-a-Box. Channel 7. Sydney.
On a recent weekend, after visiting
Fiji, the Ecumenical Council,
Indonesia, Japan and sundry other
places on television I wondered how
people can say—as many do —“There’s
nothing worth watching, these days.”
There is always something worth view-
ing, for someone, whether it’s an hour
of Shelley Berman, a sports event, tele-
vision series which are better acted than
many movies because they feature
character players instead of stars, or a
play, or even a quiz. What could you
buy in any other form of theatre for
30s. a week or less?
Even at its worst television can be
instructive. The film on Indonesia, for
instance, was introduced as “Indonesia
Today”. I expected to learn how the
nation’s 96 per cent illiteracy in 1945
had been reduced to less than 40 per
cent, how the 80 per cent of Moslems
treated the Christians, Buddhists, Taoists,
Hindus and other religious groups, why
the economy was in bad shape, and
whether the 350,000 soldiers had any-
thing to do with Indonesia’s eleven
larger islands and hundreds of small
ones, which might make it hard to
police. Things like that.
“lndonesia Today” showed some
film of life in Djakarta, where one-
fiftieth of the nation’s people live. Its
commentary claimed that the Indonesian
economy was headed for certain collapse,
that perhaps eight million were un-
employed (including I suppose the
Dyaks of Borneo and Toradjus of the
Celebes) and that graft and corruption
were standard. The tone suggested that
ATN-7 was willing to take on Indonesia
barehanded. I can tell them now, I
won’t be joining them at the barricades.
But I do thank them for the warning that
some people in Australia disagree with
The Bulletin’s recent editorial on
living with Indonesia.
To be fair, our neighbors should be
invited to photograph Saturday afternoon
in our pubs, University students pelting
guest speakers with garbage, a night out
with the poker machines, women at a
bargain sale, the Kings Cross stripper-
amas, and a surf-club stomp compered
by J. O'K. and invaded by Rockers. They
could call it “Australia Today” and write
a suitable commentary.
Alternatively we could send them a
print of the recent ABC television play
by Raymond Bowers, “The Right
Thing”, which misrepresented us just as
accurately. Mr Bowers departed from his
magazine editor’s chair and swapped Mel-
bourne for London more than a decade
ago, at a time when not all of us realised
the changes that were occurring. His
Australians are pre-1939 characters who
drive 1963 cars and live in contemporary
homes. The males are Flintstones; pub-
licans and beach boys in conflict with a
kind of supple European valor which
baffles them, though the girls understand
it well enough.
Grant Taylor played a Fred Flintstone
too stupid to run the pub which sup-
posedly kept his family in cars and a
two-storey villa, with enough grog on
hand to fill their swimming pool. Brigid
Lenihan was his wife, drawn as a com-
bination of the Seven Fates, all webs well
in hand. Lola Brooks was their thought-
ful daughter, Jeff Hodgson their potential
son-in-law, and Alistair Smart a Spanish
torero who got into the story, and their
house, for reasons which went clear over
my head.
A ll of the players acted splendidly to
the script, and with an English tele-
vision showing lined up, Raymond Men-
muir and his crew were able to step be-
yond the usual confines and do a fine
indoors-outdoors production. I suppose
we should thank Bowers for that, as he
sits in the London audience, marvelling
at the insensitiveness of his Ugly Aus-
tralians. All useful experience has to be
paid for somehow.
But really, like. You see this here
Spaniard, or Dago, takes a room in the
house the night of the engagement party.
There’s already a Spanish maid that
Fred Flintstone can’t stand a bar of, and
when he finds this Dago in his bathroom,
he staggers away and gets plastered.
Then the blokes and sheilas arrive and
one sheila discovers the Dago putting
scent on himself and she thinks he’s one
of those until one of the blokes who’s
actually been outside Australia recog-
nises him as a matador. There’s a mock
bullfight and he gets flung in the pool.
Next day they all go down the beach
to sweat out the grog, and Fred Flint-
stone’s favorite beach boy finds them
gone and calls the Spanish maid a “Dago
creep” and “lousy Wog” because she
can’t tell him which beach. But he finds
them and tries to bung on a blue with
the matador, and they talk about bulls
and sharks and bravery and yellow
streaks. Then, I think, the matador
manoeuvres his bull into plunging into
surf where a shark has been sighted,
and turns and walks away.
For Mr Bowers’ information, in 1963
the publican would have been more
likely to sign up the bullfighter for his
floor show, and any young bloke who
called another bloke a Dago would very
likely be clobbered by another of the
crowd, named diGazzio. The Spaniard
could have bathed in scent and worn
silk for all anyone cared, as long as he
could play a guitar and did not want
to throw his weight around. But let’s not
disillusion the Indonesians, or the English,
with any indications of progress. Show
them the Black Stump, “Faces in the
Crowd”, or Barry and Bob, but not young
Mario who was cheered for answering
Coles’ £3OOO worth of questions on Aus-
tralian history without a miss, after a
whole three years here.
The English would like Barry, who
knows their history backwards, to its
vague beginnings around 100 AD. The
Indonesians might not be so well dis-
posed because their history goes further,
and Barry has never been asked to reveal
any knowledge of its existence. But they
would appreciate Bob, especially Bob
confronting his critics, declaring that he
is right, and always has been right, and
will continue to be right, using 50 per
cent of history questions in his quizzes.
Barry joined him in that confronta-
tion, and then branched out on his own,
during one of those “informative” little
discussions that Bob encourages on his
programme, to confront the farmers with
a declaration that “we should buy more
dairying products from New Zealand.”
Now I’m waiting impatiently for him to
tell Frank Partridge we should buy more
bananas from Tonga and Fiji.
And perhaps we should. Who knows?

Sometime,
Never...
Lasf Year at Marienbad. Director,
Alain Resnais. Gala. Sydney.
“TYidn’t we meet last year at Marien-
** bad?”
“I wasn’t at Marienbad last year.”
“Neither was I. It must have been two
other people.”
The memory of the old music-hall joke
is irrepressible. And it will serve to
establish that as far as Alain Resnais’s
much-debated avant-garde film “Last
Year at Marienbad” is concerned, I am
among the sceptics.
It is a film that commands attention,
as does any work that tries to do some-
thing different. But I do not believe that
the search for hidden meanings among
its deliberately disjointed, repetitious
images is a really rewarding task, even
though it may while away the stretches
of monumental tedium that attend a
viewing of the film.
Far from probing deep psychological
truths or opening up new horizons in
cinematic technique, the film, for all its
superficial novelty and inflated air of
importance, seems to me threadbare. It
is its very lack of resource, of variety,
of intellectual grist and depth of feeling
that makes it such heavy going for most
of the time.
The action is confined to a vast,
oppressive, over - decorated European
hotel. Here an unnamed man and
woman meet; the man insists they met
and fell in love last year in Marienbad,
or it may have been somewhere else, or
the year before that, or even next year;
the woman denies it; the man goes on to
describe incidents in the affair; the
woman comes reluctantly (it seems) to
believe him, decides reluctantly (perhaps)
to leave the man “who may or may not
be her husband”.
But of course it is not as simple as
that. The story, if the word applies, is
told out of sequence. Time dissolves; the
scene shifts without warning or explana-
tion from the present to past and back
again; the dialogue sometimes describes
one episode while another yet to be
described is enacted, or the incident
described does not appear on the screen
until later in the film. Since both the
description and the image tend to be
unrealistic and dreamlike the connection
even then is far from clear.
This dreamlike quality is the effect
that writer Alain Robbe-Grillet and direc-
tor Resnais are quite legitimately seeking.
The pertinent question is whether it is an
interesting dream.
In the early part of the film the novelty
of the technique holds interest, if only
because it feeds the expectation that
something out of the ordinary is going
to happen. All that happens for a good
three quarters of the film’s length is that
the basic formula, the duologue accom-
panied by shifting images that seem to
grow more the same the more they
change, is relentlessly repeated, until the
hunger for some real event not just an
event in the simple sense of a develop-
ment in the story, but some cinematic
event, a change of pace or texture be-
comes almost unbearable. The final
sequences do develop some sort of a
vague climax, but by then it is too late.
A film that dispenses with the discipline
of a connected story requires some power-
ful new ingredient to command interest,
and I cannot find this ingredient in “Mari-
enbad”. The photography is smooth and
subtle; but the visual interest of the
restricted background and the stiffly mov-
ing figures is soon exhausted. The char-
acters have so little reality or appeal it
is difficult to be moved by their nebulous
problems; the dialogue (which is largely
a monologue by the man) is pretentiously
forgettable.

MUSIC
Folksiness
T'he recent visit of Pete Seeger to Aus-
tralia and the possibility of a tour
by The Weavers, together with the un-
scheduled appearance of Theodore Bikel,
and his probable return, has given point
to the growing interest in folk music in
this country. Both the high priest and
the grand old man of the American folk
movement, Seeger has been to a great
degree responsible for the general revival
of interest in the forms of folk music,
and particularly responsible for the
realistic protest it now purports to
embody. There can be little doubt of
his own sincerity in his attitude to his
art, nor in the stands he has taken.
Quietly, sanely, Pete Seeger continues to
lead his personal rebellion against what
he sees as the injustices existing in the
world and crystallised in the United
States. When he sings of the problems of
the Negro, of the unskilled worker (both
urban and rural), or of the accelerating
denial of humanity (which he sees
grown to frightening proportions in the
threat of world war and glorified in such
sports as prize-fighting) he feels it. He is
no hysterical crusader, no evangelist. If
he is idealistic, often to the point of being
naive, it is refreshing to feel that it is
not bogus idealism. Pete Seeger believes
in people and in the liberty of the indi-
vidual, and in the songs he writes and
sings there is no facile lamentation with-
out an affirmation of the positive values
of life.
It is through people such as Seeger
that folk music has tended more and
more to the (often radical) Left. Pro-
test against present wrongs seems to
necessarily involve an opposition to the
current authorities and a tendency to
extreme demands. There is some validity
in the identification of folk music with
the outcast or struggling sections of
society. But it is an identification that
has been exaggerated and distorted so
that such singers as Odetta, through her
earth-mother pose, and even Seeger with
his humanism, characterise folk songs as
a cry of the down-trodden and the true
voice of the people. This tendency has
resulted in the self-righteous cross-bear-
ing that has become one of the most dis-
tasteful and one of the most dishonest
aspects of the American, and to a less
extent the Australian, folk movement.
Seeger, too, by the way he has devoted
himself to folk music and by his rejection
of its blatant commercial exploitation,
has given momentum to its second dis-
honest characteristic, the purest fetish.
Folk music is not the only pure art form,
no more than the paintings of two-year-
old children are the only free expression-
ism. The folksier-than-thou cult, as epi-
tomised by Joan Baez, self consciously
stripping their performances of any pro-
fessionalism so as to stay as responsible
to the song as possible, emerge only as
rather effete, and make the whole form
seem ridiculous. Baez, for example, lim-
its her appearances and restricts her out-
put so as to avoid the stigma of being
labelled “commercial.” She is lucky (or
clever) enough to have created a taste for
her style of singing, and can rely on en-
thusiastic audiences waiting on her next
concert or record. Enthusiastic enough to
keep in her jeans and Jaguar sports cars.
The purest and Leftist complexion be-
ing forced on the American folk move-
ment is an unnecessary prop, a super-
fluous justification. The English counter-
tenor Alfred Deller, for example, has
recorded many Elizabethan songs and
madrigals, and is content to let the music
speak for itself. Commitment in art
can rob it of its quality, exaggerated
allegiances and policies can sacrifice its
quality to oddity. There is not in folk
music, as it could be argued there is in
jazz, a conscious self-destruction, but
there is the germ of unwitting self-
parody, which is far less romantic and
far more preposterous.
The most important benefit rising out
of the Seeger cult may be the rejuvenation
of the local folk scene. As a result of his
meeting with representatives of the
various societies concerned with folk
music here, practical emphasis has been
placed on the need to revitalize an indi-
genous folk culture. Bush ballads have
been the sum of Australian folk music
for too long. Prize competitions have been
announced, including an award for a full-
length folk opera, and one for a cycle of
folk songs on the history of the waterside
workers. Already the quasi - socialist
fiction is being subsidised but there is no
inherent error here, for work songs are
so colorful a part of the folk tradition;
it is the “champion of the proletarian”
attitude that is harmful.

ambling patterns are immediately attrac-
tive, his intentions on first sight are
clear (except for those whose eye for
ingenuousness has dimmed) and his ideas
are rich and warm. He maps familiar
places without separating the observer
from the scene or the thought from the
feeling. He is a remarkably localised
painter, a painter acutely conscious of
time and place. In quite simple terms
this exhibition is one man’s image of
Sydney; an image which includes the
very tangible features of the place but
which orders these features according to
the man's knowledge of it. So, logically
enough, the features are flat, and
crowded side by side, all of a heap,
because they are remembered over many
days and many moods. There may be
little visual depth, but there is an in-
disputable depth of ideas and experience.
His paintings swarm with life, like nests
of insects and fecund vegetation, and
they have the simple but strong beauty
of familiar things which we kick around,
and laugh with and trust.
William Frater is an earlier pioneer, of
modern rather than contemporary art.
Cezanne still stalks through his painting
as he did through most of Frater’s and
Bell’s contemporaries. It is interesting
to see how well this can stand up to very
changed sensibilities. To go, say, from
Olsen to Frater is to return substantially
to an illusion of the visible world, despite
the fact that Frater’s ideas are leagues
away from naturalism. Distances shrink
very rapidly in time. This is a huge
exhibition, and the best of it is very
attractive, especially the large airy land-
scapes and the nudes. One of the most
striking qualities of the painting is its
spaciousness, largely effected by sure
handling of light and sun-washed color.
Massively and simply composed, many
of the paintings have an apparent breadth
much greater than their real size.

THEATRE
Gun-Moll
Annie Get Your Gun. Irving Berlin.
Her Majesty’s Theatre. Sydney.
Waiting For Godot. Samuel Beckett.
Contemporary Theatre Company.
Union Theatre. Sydney.
“Annie Get Your Gun” still stands
up well in the theatre. Apart from
the chance to enjoy again the very great
talents of Irving Berlin, I recommend
Anne Hart, as Annie. She has physical
charm and that rare thing, star quality.
Along with Miss Hart, Mav Chadban
uses a lot of power in his voice and
impresses on a few occasions, without
ever getting far away from a fairly
stereotyped musical “hero”. Which is a
pity, since the play and his partner could
stand more strength. That fine player,
Dennis Glenny, gives a stand-up per-
formance as Chief Sitting Bull, every
small boy’s ideal of how an Indian chief
should look and act.
At the Union Theatre, Beckett’s essay
in gloom, which seems to have sprung
straight ftvam Spengler, was perhaps not
the wisest choice for an opening play
from a new company. “Waiting For
Godot” stretches the proper sphere of
theatre more than somewhat, in that the
portrayal of utter boredom and aimless-
ness has obvious difficulties on the stage,
and would seem impossible to maintain
for the length Beckett demands.
Moreover, Beckett is preaching a death
philosophy that is fundamentally against
the arts —which are concerned with life.
Everything that is good in “Godot” is
said or implied in the first twenty
minutes, and from then on the play is
essentially a bore, relieved, if at all, by
the interest of the actual playing. In this
production Dick May, as the grotesque
Pozzo, and Dennis Olsen as Vladimir,
one of the tramps, showed the only dis-
tinction the evening possessed.
KEVON KEMP
Will of the Gods
Oedipus the King. Sophocles. Pre-
sented by Lola Russell. Russell
Street Theatre. Melbourne.
Russell has shown courage in
presenting her company in a Greek
tragedy—something too rarely attempted
in our theatre.
George Dixon, the producer, who also
played Oedipus, presented the play in a
naturalistic style. Apart from the fact
that a small, intimate theatre like the
Russell Street Theatre is unsuitable for
a traditional presentation of a Greek
tragedy with masks and stately choric
•dances, there is a strong argument for
a naturalistic or secular approach today.
The modern temper is not sympathetic
to ritualistic drama and modern trans-
lations are informal.
The problem in presenting the play
naturalistically is to know what to do
with the chorus. Unfortunately, Mr
Dixon’s chorus were a group of anaemic
greybeards dressed in vaguely priest-like
costumes. In fact they are citizens of
Thebes who speak quite frankly to
Oedipus. And he listens to them. They
should not be just a set of ancient
mummies intoning piously.
Mr Dixon further upset the balance
of the play by opposing to this shadowy
chorus an histrionic and romantic
Oedipus posturing in gorgeous costume.
Oedipus is certainly headstrong and
hot-blooded, but he is not, as Mr Dixon
played him, a rebel like Macbeth set on
defying laws of God and man. He is
trying to be a good king and obey the
will of the gods. The citizens also hope
that Oedipus will act rightly so that the
gods will let them prosper. Between
them, the king and his subjects try -do
work out what is the will of the gods.
So it seems to me that the chorus has a
much more important part to play than
Mr Dixon allowed them, and Oedipus
should not be spotlighted in solitary
grandeur like a Shakespearean king.
The great problem in presenting a
poetic drama is the speaking of poetry.
Alwyn Owen as Teiresias was the only
actor who had mastered the speech
rhythms of the translation. George
Dixon’s voice showed need of training.

The African Vision
Struggle of a national literature
By DERICK MARSH
Modern Poetry from Africa. Penguin
Books. ss. 6d.
Blame Me On History. Bloke
Modisane. Thames and Hudson.
375. 3d.
T)erhaps because the struggles for inde-
pendence and the emergence of
new African states have caught the
imagination of the Western world as
few political movements of our time have
done, books from or about Africa have
been for a decade or more a staple of
the publisher’s trade. If, however, one
judges by quality rather than quantity,
the selling power of African themes has
not always been an advantage, even
though one can understand why Africa
proves so tempting a subject to a
novelist. The analogy that can be drawn
between the people of a continent
in search of nationhood and the in-
dividual in search of a personal identity
has been exploited by many serious
writers, while the possibilities of violence
inherent in the racial situation have
attracted others. Novels with an African
setting range from cheap romances,
through the sensationalism of a Robert
Ruark, to some sensitive and serious
explorations of the racial situation. Alan
Paton’s well-known “Cry the Beloved
Country” has been followed by the works
of white South Africans and Rhodesians
like Doris Lessing, Nadine Gordimer,
Harry Bloom and Dan Jacobson. Indeed,
some of these writers have felt that the
racial situation was becoming an obses-
sional theme, and have left the continent
for Europe or America, simply to free
themselves from the compulsion to write
always on the same subject. Paton him-
self has been so involved in the political
struggle (one result of which has been
the confiscation of his passport by the
South African Government) that it has
been some years since he attempted any
serious creative writing.
While it is true to say that so far
most of the novels of any literary quality
from Africa have been produced by
whites, they are not specifically African
in quality. The authors are men who
feel a deep commitment to the African
cause, but they write from a European
point of view. Even the autobiographies
of men like Luthuli, well written as
some of them are, and deeply moving,
do not provide a truly African litera-
ture. The half-forgotten Latin tag still
leads one to expect something new, some
wholly different school of writing,
which will express the culture and the
aspirations of what for many Europeans
is still the romantic Dark Continent. So
far, it must be admitted, these expec-
tations have not been gratified, although
there have been some individual excep-
tions. This may at first seem disappoin-
ting, and even puzzling, for present-day
Africa surely has an abundance of the
passions and tensions that in Europe in
the past have produced great literature,
but there are still many difficulties to be
overcome, of which the lack of a
common language, and the low level of
literacy, and consequent absence of a
tradition of writing are only the most
obvious.
npHERE is, for instance, the matter of
national pride. A national literature,
like a national airline, is a symbol of
prestige; a characteristic literature must
be produced not for its own sake but
in order to prove something. It is often
forgotten that the first of the emergent
nationalisms on the continent was
Afrikanerdom: in the literary history
of the Afrikaans language, which was
closely linked with the political struggles
of the Afrikaners, it is possible to see
the same kind of didacticism that
characterises some of the later literature
from further North. Because a feeling
of national identity had to be created,
Afrikaner writers tended to produce a
mass of rather dreary novels, plays and
poems, telling and retelling the stories
of the pioneers, of their struggles against
hardship, danger and tyranny. It is only
comparatively recently that a younger
generation of poets has produced a sub-
stantial body of poetry of literary merit,
by abandoning purely national themes
and returning to the individual’s response
to the world around him.
Further North, especially in countries
like Senegal, Madagascar and perhaps
the Congo, where French was the Euro-
pean language, and where some policy
of assimilation was attempted, one finds
the converse of the white nationalism of
the South. The doctrine of Negritude,
with its too easy and uncomplex rejection
of everything European, is equally dan-
gerous as a basis for literature. It hardly
seems necessary to point out that too
much African literature is too deter-
minedly the literature of revolt: too many
of the plays, poems and novels erect a
black stereotype, uncritically accepting
all that is opposed to the hated attitudes
of white colonialism, and in consequence
lose individual expression.
Some of the poets represented in
“Modern Poetry from Africa”, edited and,
where necessary, translated by Gerald
Moore and Ulli Beier (No. 7 in the
Penguin African Library), seem obsessed
with the desire to reject the cultural
heritage of Europe, or at least to stress
the differences between African and
European. David Diop, one of the more
promising of these poets (he was killed,
ironically enough, in a typically Western
disaster, an air crash, in 1960), provides
a characteristic example of this attitude
in his “To a Black Dancer”, which begins
Negress, my warm rumor of Africa
My land of mystery and my fruit of
reason
You are the dance by the naked joy
of your smile
By the offering of your breasts and
secret powers ...
The poem goes on to reject implicitly
the learning and the logic of Europe in
favor of a primitive, instinctive, sensuous
response to life. Many such poems seek
to recapture a golden age, lost with the
coming of the white man, and now
apparently again within reach. In
“Nigger Tramp” Diop promises:
I will sharpen the hurricane for the
furrows of the future
For you we will remake Ghana and
Timbuktu . . .
What one frequently notices about
these poems, besides their obtrusive,
almost political, point of view, is the
way in which they present a series of
sensuous images, in themselves quite
richly evocative but without much con-
necting thought. When that thought is
there, as it is in the work of Leopold
Sedar Senghor, President of the Republic
of Senegal, and the most successful of
these poets, the strengths of the African
sensibility are revealed. In “Totem”, a
short poem worth quoting in full, Senghor
shows a self-awareness and an aware-
ness of the need to adjust the traditional
African attitudes to the demands of the
modern world:
I must hide him in my innermost veins
The Ancestor whose strong hide is shot
with lightning and thunder
My animal protector, I must hide him
That l may not break the barriers of
scandal
He is my faithful blood that demands
fidelity
Protecting my naked pride against
Myself and the scorn of luckier races.
It is dangerous to claim much critical
validity for a judgment of poetry that
is read only in translation, but the gene-


ral impression left by the work of these
French-speaking poets is of a loosely
repetitive piling up of sensuous images,
hampered in the end by its lack of
coherence.
When one comes to the younger
generation of English-speaking poets
from Ghana and Nigeria, and East and
South Africa, one feels on more familiar
ground. Many are university trained;
indeed it is sometimes only too easy to
trace the academic influences, T. S. Eliot,
Dylan Thomas, W. H. Auden, but now
and again an individual voice breaks
through, and it is possible to recognise
the problem of the whole continent in the
dilemma of the sensitive individual. Thus
Gabriel Okara ends a poem called “Piano
and Drums” with a confession of his own
bewilderment at the conflicting pulls of
his tribal heritage and his European edu-
cation:
And I lost in the morning mist
Of an age at the riverside keep
wandering in the mystic rhythm
of jungle drum and the concerto.
It is true to say, I think, that the most
promising poetry in the volume, amongst
which I would certainly include the cool
ironies of Wole Soyinka, is not deter-
minedly African, but, using the African
situation and setting, speaks as all good
poetry should, to all men.
The most distinctively-flavored books
to come from Africa are probably still
the personal reminiscences, usually from
South Africa, where both the inter-racial
tensions and the level of African literacy
are the highest. One thinks of such books
as Albert Lutbuli's “Let My People Go”,
Peter Abrahams’ “Tell Freedom” and
Ezekiel Mphalele’s “Down Second
Avenue”. A special category in this class
contains the racy productions of African
journalists from Johannesburg, men like
Tod Matshakiza, and now Bloke
Modisane, who tell of life in the African
townships, dangerous, poverty-stricken,
yet lived with great pace and gusto.
Modisane's “Blame Me On History” is a
rambling, often inconsequential, but
nevertheless fascinating account of life
in Sophiatown, before its people were
ruthlessly evicted and its buildings bull-
dozed, under the Group Areas Act. What
emerges is what it is like to be an African
in Verwoerd's police state, how cheap life
becomes, what frustrations and hatreds
are built up. and yet how the Africans
manage somehow not only to live but
to retain a sense of humor and of shared
humanity. It is in books like this that
the tensions and suffering that have not
yet found wholly adequate expression in
the imaginative literature of Africa
emerge, and it is books like this that
convince one that when the true litera-
ture of Africa is written, it will come
from Africans; one hopes its coming will
not be long delayed.
Men of Rome
Inside The Council. Robert Kaiser.
Burns Oates. 375. 3d.
I>oth Xavier Rynne in his recent
** “Letters from Vatican City” and
Robert Kaiser in “Inside the Council”
are more interested in the Roman
Catholic Church’s future than its past,
more incisive regarding ideas than
character, and advocates of a viewpoint
with vast ramifications but with theo-
logical roots.
It is no coincidence that both Kaiser
and Rynne are Americans. Men like
Kaiser want the facts and they are pre-
pared to dig for them, they buck at the
Vatican court tradition of evasion, they
believe in information for the people,
in democratic principles and practice, so
they often look askance at the Vatican.
Last, but not least, American journalists
are paid enough to enable them to devote
all their time to Vaticanology, to take
Council experts to the best Roman
restaurants, to spend days checking on
conflicting reports.
A Vaticanologist such as Kaiser upsets
some people because he ignores the
united-front concept of the Church by
admitting that there are diverse currents
of opinion within it. He upsets others by
presenting serious matters through a mix-
ture of thumbnail sketches, gossip, pri-
vate conversations, and quotation with
an occasional philosophical excursus. He
unnerves still others by his “Time” style
which is always vivid but not always
apt.
But there are more serious reservations
to be made about “Inside the Council”.,
which is the best account of the first
Council session in English. Firstly, there
is the tangled question of terminology.
In barracking for the progressives he
gives the impression that there were only
progressives and the retrogressive clan.
It is necessary to distinguish between the
reactionaries who are opposed to any
change on principle, the conservatives
who emphasise conservation of the
essentials, the moderate progressives, and
the radicals. Moreover, any labelling
must take account, as Kaiser sometimes
forgets to, that bishops who are moder-
ate progressives on one matter may be
conservatives on another.
More surprising still is Kaiser’s lack
of understanding and perception of Pope
John. There is no doubt about his admi-
ration and affection for the Pope who is
presented through some of the innumer-
able anecdotes about him, through quota-
tion from his conversations and speeches,
and through an assessment of his influ-
ence. But Kaiser is weak precisely where
an earlier Vaticanologist such as Silvio
Negro was strong: on character and his-
tory. The two, of course, are inextricably
linked.
He is very sketchy and at times mis-
taken regarding John’s career before his
election as Pope. He suggests that dur-
ing Roncalli’s years in Paris the French
appreciated him as an amiable bon viveur,
but this would not have been sufficient
for him to have won the respect and
support of the French bishops. He also
suggests that Roncalli was appointed to
Paris solely because nobody else was
willing to be sacrificed in that difficult
post when, in fact, Roncalli’s early suc-
cess in dealing with the French priests
in Bulgaria recommended him for the
task.
Kaiser comes close to appreciating
John's freewheeling on faith but he
shows so little interest in Roncalli’s
career that he almost reinforces the myth
that John was only a homely peasant, a
parish priest. This lack of background
enables Kaiser to heighten dramatic im-
pact by presenting John as a bolt from
the blue.
This is false to a degree. John was a
peasant, but a peasant who had learned
from the varied experience of a long
life. He had served a formative period
as secretary to a bishop whose ideas on
the Church's social apostolate would still
be considered progressive. That bishop’s
later years were embittered by the
Vatican's distrust of him. Nevertheless
early in the century, in Italy, Roncalli
saw a fresh vision of the Church put into
action. Here his personal story touches
that of the Church and also of Italy.
Since the unification of Italy the Popes
have been intent on renewing the Church
which at last had lost its territories. John
was the first to succeed, admittedly, but
this success has to be seen in perspective
for it to make all the sense it should.

225. 6d.
The Unforesaken. Christian Murciaux,
trans. Peter Wiles. Harvill Press.
31s.
title of Leonard Mann’s book is
misleading, with its inevitable sugges-
tions of sultry passion under tropic
palms. In fact, it is a sober and dis-
turbing story of the problems of an
attractive half-caste aboriginal girl,
working in Melbourne, of the men who
cannot reconcile their attraction to her
beauty and their attitude to her color,
and of her final union and refuge with
another half-caste. Admirers of Mr
Mann’s earlier novels will find no sur-
prises here, the events proceed chrono-


logically, and their sequence of cause and
effect is honestly presented as the result
of the behavior of characters seen
clearly and sympathetically, if not deeply.
Christian Murciaux’s novel deals with
Spain and the Civil War. Epic events, a
wide canvas, a tragic theme are vividly
particularised in the story of Juanito, a
young Republican from the countryside
near Valencia; his faith and innocence
have to face the bitter tests of love,
loyalty, friendship, danger and death in
the course of a few years of war. It is
not surprising that this novel won a
French Academy award; it is economical,
rich and beautifully proportioned. M.
Murciaux knows Spain, the Spanish War
and the Spanish character; his novel is
a glowing expression of his admiration.

Correctives
World Communism. Sidney Hook. Van
Nostrand. 15s. 9d.
T>rofessor Hook, Chairman of the
Philosophy Department at New
York University, is one of those pro-
gressive liberals, quite numerous in
America but rare in Australia, who have
never prostituted themselves on behalf
of totalitarianism. A philosopher of dis-
tinction, and an unrepentant intellectual
opponent of religion, he has made the
very considerable personal sacrifice of
spending much of his professional life
pursuing the dreary but necessary task
of exposing supporters of totalitarianism
inside the liberal community. He has
educated a generation of students who
understand the simple truth that a com-
munist concentration camp regime is not
a repository of the doctrines of John
Stuart Mill. It may very well have been
men and movements like Hook whom
the late Pope John had in mind when he
gave Catholics permission to co-operate
with progressives even if they are theo-
logically “in error” (this appears to be
Fr Courtney Murray’s interpretation of
Part V of the encyclical Pacem In
Terris).
The present paperback is a mere
manual for beginners and intended as
such. It contains extracts from pertinent
documents covering all aspects of com-
munist policy and organisation, begin-
ning with Lenin’s 1902 training manual
“What is to be done.” Each section starts
with a trenchant and competent intro-
duction by the author. The introductions
contain some timely reminders: despite
changes in administrative methods the
Khrushchev regime is still fully totali-
tarian; the libertarian aspects of the
Gomulka regime are being swiftly eroded;
the Chinese Communists who were gen-
erally regarded as mere “agrarian re-
formers” by liberals less than two
decades ago have turned out to be the
most simplistic and dangerous of the
whole communist fraternity; Tito’s policy
has been one of consistent support for
the communist camp ever since Stalin’s
death and Djilas is still in prison; com-
munist parties in all major Western coun-
tries are still extensions of the Soviet
state apparatus.
There is evidence that the communists
are trying to stage a comeback in Aus-
tralian universities. One of their main
assets is the fact that the new generation
of 18-year-old students have not lived
politically through Hungary, barely re-
member Stalin, and Yalta, the Moscow
trials and the Spanish Civil War are
for them what the Boer War, Omdurman
and General Kitchener were for earlier
generations history book stuff with-
out emotional significance.
Middle-aged communist and fellow-
travelling intellectuals have now so
thoroughly appropriated an anti-Stalin
pose that the young and uninstructed
do not suspect how slavishly they had
supported him before Khrushchev told
them not to in 1956. Attacks on Stalin,
and the concomitant lie that with his
death evil has died in the USSR, are
now just another Party chore as slavish
adulation used to be in the recent past.
Hook’s book can do a lot to provide
the average university student with the
minimum historical knowledge necessary
to counter a process which, if un-
checked, may produce another genera-
tion of Macleans, Philbys and Milners.
FRANK KNOPFELMACHER
Teutons
Twentieth-Century German Verse.
Ed. Patrick Bridgwater. Penguin.
3s. 6d.
T>efore one starts to argue with Mr
Bridgwater’s selection in “Twentieth-
Century German Verse” it must be said
that almost all the poems in the book
are good or interesting. All poets in-
cluded are represented by some of their
best work, and some Benn, Enzens-
berger, Arp show up better here
than in other anthologies. In most cases
the poems have the effect of making
one want to read more of the poet’s
work; and this is the prime function of
an anthology.
The second function to give a
fairly comprehensive picture of the verse
of a particular time and/or place is
not quite so satisfactorily fulfilled. The
anthology begins, appropriately, with
Nietzsche, establishing his position as a
major influence and as lock-gate through
which all other streams had to pass in
order to flow into the 20th century.
Thereafter, however, one could argue
that the emphasis is misplaced. Of the
66 poets included, 20 are already rep-
resented in the Penguin Book of Ger-
man Verse. While it is necessary for
these poets to appear again to give a
balanced picture of 20th century verse,
it might have been preferable to give
less space to them while introducing im-
portant and influential earlier poets like
Agnes Miegel, Rudolf Borchardt,
Mombert and Wedekind; and to devote
more space to post-Expressionist and
contemporary poetry. Picking younger,
less-known poets is a tricky business,
but it is one of the tests of an antholo-
gist. The youngest poet included here is
Enzensberger, born 1929, who already
has a firmly established reputation.
Some of the most interesting of the
younger poets, who help to define the
pattern of modern German verse —-
Gunter Grass, Hdllerer, Christine La-
vant, and, particularly, Christoph
Meckel are excluded. However,
Bridgwater introduces a number of little-
known and excellent poets such as
Schmiele, Kaleko and Fried.
The poems are preceded by a long in-
troductory essay which attempts to situ-
ate German trends and poets by drawing
a parallel between German and Anglo-
American verse of the 20th century.
This approach relies too much on anal-
ogies between all the Germans and three
English poets —• Yeats, Eliot, Pound
rather than elucidating characteris-
tics and tendencies by reference to the
poems themselves. Unsupported opinions
which are entangled in major literary
controversies are given as facts, as for
instance some statements on Nietzsche
and Rilke (whose Elegies, incidentally,
are misdated; they were completed in
1922, not 1923). When so much that is
relevant or even essential is omitted one
wonders why little asides like “Ernst
Stadler was a Rhodes Scholar at Mag-
dalen College, Oxford (‘dear old Ox-
ford’ as he called it)” are included; un-
less, of course, to illustrate Stadler’s
ability to turn a neat phrase. On the
other hand the account of Impression-
ism, Expressionism and Surrealism and
their inter-relationship is excellent, and
the evaluation of such poets as George,
Brecht and Benn perceptive.
The poems are accompanied by “plain
prose translations” intended to help
readers with little or no knowledge of
German. The quality of these transla-
tions lacks any consistency; they are
sometimes literal, sometimes arty, some-
times plain wrong. Most serious are a
number of mistranslations in the first
of Rilke’s “Sonette an Orpheus,” in
Gan’s “Preis der Dinge” and in Wcrfel’s
“Der dicke Mann ...” which run
counter to the whole idea of the poem.

POETRY
I'm a killer, I am
Catapults in hand and pocket,
children scramble past me, pinning
my ears with their excited screams
We hit him. He’s down. Did you see that shot
how 1 aimed and Piinnggg! I’m a killer, I am.
At the stoning-point of jubilance
a lorikeet rolls its nape in the gutter,
one foot pinching the leap of air
(two toes forward, two toes back)
green as feathered sap of woodland,
nimble as life with sky in its bones.
But the dainty stove-in breast is heavy.
And its eye, that one surviving weapon,
holds-off crouching spellbound huntsmen.
Somewhere, huge within me,
dark wings unfold.
RODNEY HALL
Holy sonnet
Light fuels the buried skull. Vvhere temples crown
the bitter herbage of an ancient field
the soil is found, obedient to the frown
or smile of man or minister, to yield
its store of grain. Under the milling town
within the blinded sockets, stirs, concealed,
the blood of seasons, feeding with its brown
resilience man’s deathwounds, borne and healed.
For though the moon of innocence is down
or waned, declined from fullness into blight
and hung, some fruitless ember, for the night
to wander careless through his wounded side
still in his blood he rises, and casts down
through flower to bone, his radiance for his bride.

The Concertina
The moonlight shivers in the pepperina.
The night is cold. The colored concertina
Swings like a Chinese lantern in the window
And the singers toast their song. Clink and
crescendo.
High behind, the mountain pine and starling
Toucji in shadow, wing to leaf, and, falling,
One star draws a fading line from heaven.
The singers prime their throats. The clock thrums
seven.
The log fire feeds its snapping salamander,
Creature strong as brandy, bright as candour,
And the yard dog curled in backstairs weather
Whines at the wild-dog dingo’s howl of leather.
The night is cold.
The wind is a winter river.
We turn from the fallen star and moonlight shiver,
From the mountain shadow; join the song and
candour,
Drink, and feel the lively salamander
Bite warmth into our lips and words of ashes.
It is goodbye. The bittern booms on the marshes.

How are we going? Can't complain
Got the long service coming up
And a lot to do in the garden; might take a sickie.
She was that close, we were that thrilled!
Weightlessness, emptiness, lack of pressure
Afternoon light like a hallucination
Symbol of the city, symptom of its nature
The idle insolence of taxidrivers.
These accidentals not by chance evoke
The Patrick White or Barry Humphries country:
A flashlight glare is natural to snapshots
Appals us, makes us wonder who we are
A dozen cards can summarise a life.
Yet he who lives here knows himself substantial
His world drawn round him, planted in his concerns
Firm as a shrub. Do transients know better
Or bulldozers, that so crudely cut earth bare
To yellow subsoil, crumple paper pavements?

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Dr Adenauer’s Waspish Farewell
Accession of West Germany’s Dr Erhard to the office
of Chancellor on October 15 officially marks an end
to the remarkable political career of the “wily fox”, Dr
Adenauer. European observers say that, unofficially, the hand
of the old man will remain poised in the background, ready
to prod or parry any moves of his successors so they do not
stray too far from the path already set by the ex-Chancellor.
It’s an old fox for a hard autobahn.
Dr Erhard does not face an easy task. The remarkable
shadow of his predecessor blots out any hope for individual
limelight, at least for the time being. And the rotund, jovial
Dr Erhard may find it difficult to laugh off some of the parting
shots of Dr Adenauer as he went into voluntary retirement.
Before he departed the official scene, the Chancellor, who
guided West Germany through the difficult post-war years,
permitted himself the pleasure of putting some old-fashioned
unofficial hungers under the chairs of his erstwhile European
and American counterparts . . . possibly a gesture of roguish
self-satisfaction to get a few things off his chest after years of
carefully walking a political tightrope.
The hunger tossed in the direction of Mr Macmillan’s
impeccably striped pants seemed to imply that the “young”
Tory leader just didn’t have what it takes.
Although respecting America’s power, Dr Adenauer ap-
parently does not believe that the youthful Mr "Kennedy can
be trusted to sustain the currently favorable relatione between
East and West.
Also, he evidently thinks that the recent feelers put out by
Britain’s Labor Party to the German Social Democrats (as
a prelude to closer relations in view of a possible Labor success
at the next UK elections) are unlikely to bring any benefits
to the West Germans. He thinks the British Labor groups are
too tolerant of Communism and that they have no real under-
standing of the working man’s problems in West Germany,
laboring under the protection (or occupation) of the Allies but
faced across the border by their own countrymen laboring
under Russian occupation.
He is interpreted as suggesting that Britain has fallen down
on the job. She is losing ground and is unreliable. He still
rankles at earlier political clashes with Britain and tends to
overlook Britain’s support for his regime when others opposed
him. He is inclined to dismiss this support as a matter of
necessary self-interest on the part of Britain.
He remembers, too, that a British Labor Government was
in office when he first came to power, which was hardly com-
patible with a non-Labor Government of a defeated Germany.
His success (if anyone can claim that) in handling General
Charles de Gaulle can be attributed to the fact that they are
two old men of Europe, steeped in history and living in the
past . . . both with the aim of reviving the past glories of their
respective nations. Dr Adenauer and General de Gaulle wish
to retain individual representation in Europe and do not want
to see their nations submerged as mere strips of occupied
territory which have no say in the ideological war between
East and West.
But time is something neither Dr Adenauer nor de Gaulle
can hold back (though it is claimed both have done a very
good job to date). The Common Market, as an integrated
market place for the six European members, has raised new
concepts in Europe, including the free flow of labor from
nation to nation. Mr Harold Wilson’s effort to link British
Labor with West German (and European) Labor could have
far-reaching political significance in a new, but slowly evolving,
social structure in Europe.
The greatest impediment is mistrust and past hatreds. In
stepping down from office, Dr Adenauer did little to alleviate
that mistrust.
He retains his chairmanship of the Christian Democratic
Union and has demonstrated that, despite his age, he will
not retire from the political arena. He has moved into an
office in the Bundeshaus where he will keep a vigilant eye on
the “youngsters” now in power.
Leasing With an Eye to
Ultimate Profit
At a Sydney Press conference last week to welcome its
London head office general manager, Mr K. A. Usher-
wood, FIA, the Prudential Assurance revealed that some
of its property deals in Australia (notably with the ANZ Bank)
are based on a lease-back arrangement at i p.c. above the
normal first mortgage rate.
Based on present first mortgage rates of around 6i p.c. to
6J p.c., Prudential’s interest rate on a 45-year industrial
mortgage would be around 7 p.c. It is not an exceptional
margin, but at least there are no administrative problems such
as those which sometimes are involved in supervising small
mortgage loans, particularly if payments fall behind.
It is interesting to note that the 45-year lease-back contract
with the bank includes a clause which allows the lessee to
re-purchase the property at any time between 40 and 45
years from the date of signing the contract, with the purchase
price calculated at half way between the cost and the then
current valuation. Assuming the property increases in value
(and who can say that it won’t?) there is a prospective capital
profit for both parties.
Mr N. B. Clark, the “Pru’s” investment manager, who
handles funds of around £2i m. a week, also is visiting Aus-
tralia to have a look at some of the investment projects out
here. Doubtless a few local developers would like to get their
hands on some of those millions which Mr Clark disperses as
a routine chore.


Don’t Smoke... Just Filter
for Preference
/Cigarette smokers are smoking less and trying to keep
farther away from cigarettes, according to figures filtering
through the mass of campaign arguments for and against
smoking. Consumption per head of population in the USA is
showing a slight fall after an uninterrupted rise since 1954,
but filter smoking is still on the rise.
National campaigns against smoking have left their mark
on world cigarette manufacturers.
The cigarette smoker in the USA is forced to contend with
an impressive opposition to his conditioned habit of smoking.
The American Heart Association announced last June that it
believed smoking contributes to the development of heart
disease; life assurance companies have offered special bonus
policies to non-smokers and
various schools have conducted
educational campaigns against
smoking (including the refusal
to accept cigarette ads in college
newspapers).
Several European countries
have introduced national cam-
paigns against smoking and, as
if that isn’t enough to worry
manufacturers into extra smok-
ing, the Florida State Supreme
Court recently issued an ad-
visory opinion that the American
Tobacco Company is liable for
damages in a case where the
death of a man who smoked
Lucky Strike cigarettes was
caused by lung cancer.
Naturally, the legal eagles got
stuck into that one and, with
many similar cases pending, this
issue will be fought to the last
legal piece of paper. This
places great stress on the find-
ings of the US Surgeon-General,
who is scheduled to produce by
the end of 1963 an independent
report on the effects of smoking.
Consumption figures, both in
the US and elsewhere, indicate
a massive trend towards filter
tips, generally interpreted as a
compromise by smokers to stay
away from cigarettes as far as
possible.
Australian figures show that
consumption of filter-tip ciga-
rettes has just about trebled
since 1959. The trend is much
more definite than in the US.
Whereas US figures indicate a
fall in the per capita consump-
tion of all types of cigarettes,
Australian figures (up to the end of 1962) showed that total
consumption and consumption per head were still rising.
Carreras, UK, which produces Rothmans and Piccadilly in
opposition to such giants as Imperial Tobacco and Gallaher,
has just issued its annual accounts in London and con-
CIGARETTE SMOKING TRENDS
fidently predicts a further solid expansion in the smoking of
filter tips.
Indicative of its confidence is Carreras’s claim that filter tips
will represent half the UK cigarette sales in two years and, to
cope with this expansion, it is going ahead with plans to
erect a new £stg.3im. factory at Belfast.
Carreras is doing this at a time when UK television stations
have been asked to ban all cigarette advertising.
Commodity Markets Upset
By Indonesia
HThe disruption of trade between Singapore and Indonesia
has already had a decided effect on world prices of the
three commodities most involved rubber, tin, pepper. All
of these are sensitive to abrupt
changes in the outlook for spot
deliveries.
Nobody believes that world
markets will have to get along
without supplies from Indonesia
for long, despite the fact that
alternative markets will have to
be found for about 80 p.c. of
the primary products exported
from that country, that is the
share previously going to Singa-
pore.
Indonesia exports about
35,000 tons of rubber a month.
This has heretofore been going
mainly to Malaysia to be milled,
sorted and packed. It will take
some time to find alternative
markets. In the meantime world
rubber prices, both spot and
forward, have moved up sharp-
ly after being recently depress-
ed.
Indonesia sent its tin to
Malaysia for smelting following
its break with Holland but is
now reverting to smelters at
Arnhem in that country. This
will mean a break in the re-
gular supply of smelted tin to
European markets, and in
consequence the forward price
of tin has jumped. The rise
has removed the backwardation
on the spot tin price caused
by the recent market squeeze
from operators who bought
heavily three months ago when
caught short of supplies.
The price of pepper, which
had been depressed for a long
time and reached its lowest
point for four years just before
the Malaysia business broke, has
also risen sharply, particularly
the cheaper black pepper coming largely from Indonesia.
Much of Indonesia's pepper had formerly been going to Singa-
pore to be packed and uncertainty about the future disposal
of this pepper has been causing uneasiness in the world
market.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
The Banks Prepare for Decimals
Balance of advantage not yet clear
TTSTith about two and a half years in
which to prepare for decimal
currency the monetary machine com-
panies and large financial institutions, in
particular the banks,, are steadily build-
ing up their organisation for the change-
over, Mr F. C. Pike, assistant chief in-
spector of the Commercial Banking Com-
pany of Sydney, told a Bankers’ Institute
of Australasia audience in Melbourne
last week.
Mr Pike said that while he expected
Australia would follow South Africa in
many matters appertaining to the change-
over it does not necessarily mean that
in every respect the action to be taken
here will be on the same lines as there.
In South Africa the complete change-
over was effected in less than one year—
six months less than expected. To fully
protect the rights of creditors and
debtors an Act was passed by Parliament
providing that any law, deed, instrument,
security for money, document, contract,
etc., whether in writing or not, expressed
in £ s d should, after D-day, be deemed
to be an equivalent amount in Rand-
cents at the official conversion rate.
It was not obligatory, for example, for
companies to withdraw and replace out-
standing share certificates issued in
£s d. After a company had changed
over, however, all new certificates issued
had to be in Rand-cents.
banks and Post Office changed
over to recording all transactions in
decimal currency on decimalisation day,
Tuesday, February 14, 1961 —known as
“D” day. It was decided that it would
be impracticable for banks to carry on
over the transitional period with some
branches recording in £ s d and some in
decimal currency. The whole banking
system effected a rapid and complete
change-over and as from D-day carried
on in decimal currency.
Other organisations and firms could
change over on D-day if they so desired,
and if their £s d machines could be
converted or replaced by decimal
machines in time. Those that did not
change over on D-day did so as and
when their monetary machines could be
converted by the office machine com-
panies.
But as all banks changed their account-
ing over to decimal currency on D-day,
any transaction with a bank, whether by
way of deposit or by drawing cheques,
had to be in decimal currency as from
that day. This meant that all businesses
still operating in £ s d had to keep the
banking account itself or at least a
column of it in decimal currency in its
books.
The main cost involved in switching
to decimals is in the change-over in
monetary machines. The estimated cost
of replacing the (approximately) 400,000
monetary machines, comprising cash
registers, adding machines, accounting
machines, taxi meters, computing scales,
bowsers, cheque signing machines and
so on, would be about £38,000,000 for
conversion and premature scrapping of
monetary machines alone, Mr Pike said.
Also additional salaries, wages and over-
time would be incurred and money lost
in scrapping unusable £s d stationery
and forms.
TTowever. Mr Pike emphasised that the
adoption of decimal currency would
reduce the price of machines, allow us
access to European makes which are not
available at present, and result in the
latest types being available as soon as
they are produced. Most monetary
machines in use in Australia are £s d
adaptions from the original decimal
machines. Since these are more compli-
cated than similar decimal types they are
more expensive.
Mr Pike said it is popularly assumed
that banks and other institutions pro-
cessing a large number of monetary
entries will achieve a substantial saving
in time and in costs by the introduction
of decimal currency.
While, admittedly, there will be a
saving so far as manual entries of
amounts and mental mathematical calcu-
lations are concerned, by far the greater
part of a bank’s entries are recorded
and added or subtracted by monetary
machines and the keyboarding of £ s d
entries on machines takes little more
time (about 5 to 7 p.c. longer) than the
keyboarding of a similar quantity of
decimal entries. So as the time required
for checking and sorting will remain
unaltered, in Mr Pike’s view the intro-
duction of decimal currency will not
effect any significant saving in the time
required to fully process bank entries.
Where vouchers are sorted and entries
recorded by electronic data processing
equipment the equipment is capable of
operating with either £s d or decimal
currency amounts and a change-over to
decimal currency would effect little or
no saving at all.
If the policy were adopted of with-
drawing the old currency and placing the
new currency into circulation as soon as
possible, an additional and heavy burden
would be thrown on the banks. If a
rapid change-over of currency were to
be effected the banks would be required
to separate and retain old currency paid
in and not re-issue it, and, at the same
time, pay out only in the new currency.
fFHERE would be a constant stream of
the old currency to the Reserve Bank
and an equal or greater movement of the
new currency from the Reserve Bank.
This would cause a substantial increase in
movements of cash (and the cost of
moving it) to and from bank branches
and their capital city offices. It follows
that the banks would be forced to
increase their cash holdings materially
during the currency change-over period
and this could be met by releases from
statutory reserve deposit accounts, or, in
the case of banks not subject to the
statutory reserve deposit provisions (State
banks and savings banks), the position
could be met by a temporary loan from
the Reserve Bank.
So, Mr Pike stated, while there will
be advantages for the whole community
in adopting decimal currency and for
certain sectors the costs and incon-
venience of the change-over will be
quickly outweighed by the benefits
gained, the balance of advantage is not
clear for the banks. Because of their
present high incidence of mechanisation,
the widespread nature of their representa-
tion, and because they will be required
to make an immediate change-over, the
banks do not expect the immediate
benefits to be commensurate with the
cost and inconvenience of the change-
over, though they see that there may be
long-term advantages.
The banks have therefore made rep-
resentations to the authorities that in
addition to being reimbursed for the
expense involved on monetary machines,
they should be also compensated for
other costs peculiar to the banking
industry. The latter include salaries,
wages, overtime and meal money pay-
ments attributable to the change-over,
advertising and the cost of pamphlets,
etc., aimed at preparing the public for
the change-over, and wastage of £s d
forms.
In looking at these claims perhaps the
Government will take into consideration
that over the long period its own costs
will be partly offset by the withdrawal
of the present silver alloy coins and their
replacement with cupra nickel coins. It
has been estimated that this could amount
to about £25,000,000, stated Mr Pike.


Business Should Regain the
Spark of Confidence
Promise of a really prosperous year
By ROGER RANDERSON
What is wrong with Australia? This
is the question I am asked by
overseas visitors who have read
some of the feverish assessments of
generally out-of-date economic indicators
that appear in some sections of our Press.
Far from anything being wrong, I
answer, we are just past the first quarter
of what promises to be one of the most
prosperous years in our history.
It is true that the spark of confidence
is missing in some sections of our
business community.
But it is high time that they ceased
looking to the Government to wave a
magic wand, put aside their doubts and
fears, and confidently grasped the
opportunities that are opening out.
Surely local businessmen should take
their cue from the ready response of the
London money market to the Common-
wealth’s recent loan there, and from the
continuing large stream of private over-
seas capital which is being invested here.
I would be the last to decry the
erudite examinations of business statistics
that we read daily.
Much of this national pulse-taking,
however, seems to be needlessly directed
towards trying to find symptoms of ill-
ness, or trying to show what the Govern-
ment should, or should not, have done
any time during the past three or four
years.
A long time has elapsed since the
short, sharp recession, although we are
not allowed to forget it.
And, as they used to say on the Stock
Exchange, no one will get richer by
“jobbing backwards”.
IV|’any a country envies Australia the
strength of her external finances to-
day. It is in marked contrast to the weak
and worsening position with which the
Menzies Government had to deal in
1960.
Australia can call on overseas
purchasing-power equivalent to about
£AIOOO million as reserves to bolster
export earnings. Besides national hold-
ings of gold and balances abroad, there
are drawing rights with the Inter-
national Monetary Fund, the undrawn
balance of a World Bank loan and
amounts coming to us from China in
repayment of wheat credits.
This in itself offers assurance against
the necessity for the repetition of de-
flationary internal measures to balance
our external position.
Already part of the previous large
handicap to local enterprise, as well as
exporting, has been removed by the
steadying of local costs and prices,
during a period when many other
countries have been less successful in
keeping their costs in check.
More particularly, this has brought a
new deal to the rural and mining in-
dustries, on the prosperity and develop-
ment of which depend much of the
development of our vast hinterland.
This season we may expect a record
wool clip of about 1738 million 1b.—41
per cent greater than last year—and wool
prices are at present about 17 per cent
higher than they were a year ago.
HThe “terms of trade” have swung back
considerably in Australia’s favor, with
marked rises in export prices for sugar,
metals and coal, dairy produce and
meats, besides wool.
Trade figures for the three months
ended September 30 are exceptionally
good. Merchandise exports, valued at
£316 million, exceed by £B9 million the
figure in the corresponding quarter of
the previous year, and show a surplus
over imports of £3l million, compared
with a deficiency of £47 million.
A record year of export income is in
prospect. This will inevitably lead to an
increase in demand for the products of
our metropolitan industries.
Much of the vastly increased govern-
mental expenditure on inland projects
such as standardisation of railway gauges,
beef roads, dams, clearing of brigalow,
expenditure on the North Cape base and
so on will similarly swell the demand
for products of our local secondary
industries.
Whatever may seem to be the position
in more mature economies, there is no
dearth of new investment outlets in Aus-
tralia. All we need is businessmen to
show more imagination and vigor in
making and selling new and better
products.
It is perfectly true, as was stated in
the White Paper, “The Australian
Economy, 1963”, that the “quick succes-
sion of rich mineral discoveries—bauxite,
copper, iron ore and now oil —lift the
horizons of Australian growth quite
incalculably”.
Businessmen may have been too much
impressed by academic speculation to the
effect that national growth will slow
down in the ’sixties. The best correc-
tive to this opinion is to read the White
Paper’s convincing arguments to the
contrary.
“While the shortages and bottle-necks
of the ’fifties evoked special efforts and
expenditures,” it states, “they acted in
other ways as a drag on growth, slow-
ing down and limiting output.
“It would be an odd commentary on
a nation as well endowed as ours if
strong growth had to rely upon the
perpetuation of bottle-necks.”
Tt is true, as Press commentators remind
us, that there are problems along
the road, such as the public’s increasing
liquidity.
This can easily be exaggerated.
Funds left in fixed deposits with the
banks, and even a large proportion of
those deposited with the savings banks,
should be distinguished from mobile
spending-power, although they are in-
cluded in conventional estimates of the
volume of money.
Gentle movements in interest rates
should be sufficient to steady the
economy when there are signs much
more definite and pronounced than at
present —that personal savings may fall
too low.
It must always be remembered that
stability of prices makes the real or
effective rate of interest higher than
when prices are rising rapidly.
Next year’s determination of the
Federal basic wage, following the recent
widespread increase in margins, con-
stitutes another problem. One can only
hope that the Commission will be more
fully advised than in the past as to the
benefits that working men gain from
price stability.
But there are always problems of one
kind or another in human affairs —even
in the midst of high prosperity.
And this is now a most favorable
time for raising funds and pushing for-
ward with plans for business expansion.
Those businessmen who take long
views of their country’s future will almost
certainly be well rewarded.

An Onion-Shaped Society
Economic History Of A Fairly Distant Future
Tt has usually been left to the likes
of H. G. Wells and George Orwell to
paint in the future economic, social and
scientific shapes looming out of the
mists of time, riding -out wars and revo-
lutions alike. Even Keynes himself fore-
bore to predict the economic weather
very far into the predictably uncertain
future.
So it is brave, perhaps foolhardy, of
Ronald Brech, Unilever’s chief econo-
mist in London, to give us a blueprint
of the sort of investments which will
be turning up trumps in 1984 in his
recently published Britain 1984: Uni-
lever’s Forecast, an Experiment in the
Economic History of the Future.
The solid ground of Brech’s fore-
casts is the moral certainty that the
society of the future will be one in
which the demarcation of classes is
blurred and nearly everyone is squashed
into the middle income group.
With ability and conscientiousness as
the standards of reference, the few
geniuses rise to the top and the few
cretins sink to the bottom, leaving the
mass of ordinary people in the middle,
linked by “common speech, common
dress, common consumer habits, com-
mon leisure pursuits and common ob-
jectives in life the diamond loses its
rigid shape and the structure of society
becomes more akin to an onion.”
Income, as expressed visibly in buy-
ing goods and services and not inherited
power and property, will be the status
symbol of this society, everybody striv-
ing more and more to “keep up with the
Joneses.”
(Ronald Brech, with whom I worked
at The Economist for five years, has,
to my knowledge, never been to Aus-
tralia, so if his 1984 society may seem
to fit our present image this is purely
coincidental.)
In its economic manifestations the
society of 1984 spells high materialism,
small shades of differentiation in con-
suming habits, a heightened rate of ob-
solescence and concentration on high-
productivity industries in the hands of
big companies.
Each industry will be dominated by a
few large firms competing strongly
against each other and a large number
of small firms, mainly concerned with
specialised components and specialised
end-products. The large firms themselves
will be protecting themselves against the
risks of massive capital involvement in
producing for a rapidly changing market
by diversifying their products range.
Some industries will rise higher than
the average, others less than it. The
really big increases in the manufactur-
ing field, says Brech, will be in plastics,
pharmaceuticals, toilet preparations, ad-
hesives and chemicals generally.
“Other major growth industries” will
be vehicles, aircraft, electronics, radio
and electrical engineering.
Also expanding faster than average,
Brech puts paper and packaging, rubber,
glass, cement, toys, games, sports equip-
ment, aluminium and other special met-
als and building and construction (but
not steel which one might expect to be
higher on the list in Australia than in
Britain where its future growth rate
would be more closely linked with ex-
port than with domestic demand).
Educational services, insurance, bank-
ing, medical, dental and other profes-
sional services, hotels, catering and the
distributive trades will all become
relatively more important in the
economy.
The food industry (Unilever’s main
concern) is expected to maintain its
present share of output, but there will
be big changes inside the industry,
notably expansion of food processing and
a further swing to foods of convenience.
Drink, especially non-alcoholic, may
expand but Brech expects tobacco to
decline.
In transport air traffic will expand but
railway and public road - passenger
activity (as distinct from private motor-
ing) will not.
Also set to drop behind are ship-
building (the opposite could happen
here), textiles other than man-made
fibres (presumably this rules out an
increase in Britain’s wool textile in-
dustry), leather, fur, clothing, footwear,
timber, furniture and pottery.
It remains for somebody in this coun-
try with as fertile an imagination and as
expert in the art of economic forecasting
as Brech, backed by good research staff
even if not of the 'dimensions of Uni-
lever’s Economics and Statistics Depart-
ment, to try a similar exercise for Aus-
tralia. The resulting onion might not be
so very different.


CAMBRIDGE CREDIT CORPORATION LIMITED
CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS, 1962-'63
It is gratifying that at this Thirteenth Annual General Meet-
ing of the Corporation I am able to report that the Corporation
has continued to expand, and that in the past year a record profit
has been achieved and that there is every indication that the
Corporation will be able to maintain its progress in the year
ahead.
It is with regret that I record the death of Mr. R. E. B.
Hutcheson during the financial year. Mr. R. E. B. Hutcheson
served as the Corporation’s Secretary since its formation in 1950
and contributed greatly toward the Corporation’s present growth
and status.
Mr. T. G. Whitbread who has been closely associated with the
Corporation for several years was elected to the Board.
Mr. E. Davis - Raiss was appointed Secretary of the
Corporation.
FINANCIAL: During the past year the Corporation’s net
tangible assets have again increased from the figure of
£12.444,018 at June 30 last year to £13,564,976 at June 30 this
year.
The Corporation has maintained a steady dividend rate of
12+ per cent per annum for the last eight years and your
Di rectors again recommend a final dividend of 6} per cent
continuing the previous 12+ per cent rate.
This is a pleasing result because in the year past your
Corporation, in common with others in the Finance Industry,
has had to face difficult periods brought about by several
unfortunate happenings which have had serious repercussions
in the money market.
These tests of strength, along with those of previous years
have, your Directors believe, demonstrated clearly the soundness
of Cambridge Credit Corporation.
The net profit of the group amounted to £216,989.
This figure is arrived at after providing £86,770 for tax, an
increase of £32,493; allowance for depreciation £22,833, up
£8,736; and after writing off all known bad debts.
The net profit was an increase of 26 per cent on that of the
previous financial year.
The payment of the 12+ per cent dividend will absorb £151,574
from the net profit and the Directors have recommended that
£70,000 of the remaining profit be transferred to general reserves.
I feel sure you will agree with me that in all the circumstances
the results are most satisfactory.
SECURITY: During the past year your Directors have continued
their strict policy of maintaining sound security and control
in all accounts.
This policy has had two outstanding results.
The first is the high standard of cover on loans on real
estate mortgages which comprise the great bulk of the
Corporation's business.
A survey of this cover has shown that at the last balancing
date the independent valuations of real estate securities exceeded
the principal outstanding by more than £3,000,000 —not taking
into account the unearned income still to mature on these
accounts.
The second result has been the quite remarkably small
percentage of bad debts which occur in any of the Corporation’s
accounts, including hire purchase and bills of sale..
It will be seen, therefore, that the policy of your Directors has
given the Corporation’s shareholders, debenture holders and
note holders the maximum possible security.
It will be noted from the Balance Sheet that the Corporation’s
outstandings at June 30 stood at £16,791,134 against £14,677,815
at June 30, 1962.
Of the outstandings, £13,442,372 was secured by long and
short term mortgages, while £2,678,016 is on hire purchase and
secured loans.
The remainder of £670,746 consists of mortgages and other
receivables where the charges are not written in. During the
twelve months, provision for unearned income rose from
£5,219,682 to £6,061,375.
LIQUIDITY: Because of lessons learned in the last few years
from sudden and sharp changes in the general economy, your
Directors have sustained a policy of a constant and higher than
average state of liquidity. This factor, we believe, has given
encouragement to investors to support our debenture and note
issues.
I am happy to say that the debenture and notes issue which
opened in April last to raise £400,000 closed last week with
an over subscription of over £600,000.
It will be noted that First Mortgage Debenture Stock redeem-
able within twelve months amounts to £2,259,423.
This includes one currency of £1,256,476 which matures on
June 30, 1964. Your Directors wish to confirm that redemption
or repayment on that date has been provided for. The size
of this currency was due to the heavy subscriptions to the
Corporation's first debenture issue and consequently maturing
dates were not staggered as has been done in the case of all
subsequent issues.
As general economic confidence is being gradually restored
in the investing public, we find that the rate of renewals of
deposits is increasing satisfactorily.
Therefore, with the substantial amounts the Corporation has
on immediate call, satisfactory collections from borrowers and
the sound support of investors, the Corporation has what we
believe is an enviable condition of liquidity at all times.
A new debenture and notes issue has just been launched.
We anticipate it will bring a good deal of new money into the
Corporation which can be profitably used in the many avenues
of secured lending available, particularly in real estate.
DIVIDEND POLICY: For some time your Directors have been
considering means by which they can add to the internal strength
of the Company.
In the last few years, because of the Corporation’s rapid
expansion, it has been necessary at various times to increase
Paid Up Capital as a base for increased borrowings to meet
available business.
Your Directors have found that to service this enlarged
capital at the current dividend of 12+ per cent per annum they
have not been able to build up reserves in the proportion
to capital that they believe is prudent.
Although it was stated at the time of the recent one for five
issue that the Directors expected to maintain the 121 per cent
dividend rate nevertheless they now consider that the interests
of shareholders will be best served by a policy, which will, over
the next few years, enable them to retain more profits to lift
reserves to a more conservative figure in relation to capital.
For this reason it has been decided that from the current
year on, the Directors propose to recommend a dividend rate
of 10 per cent per annum.
As your Directors confidently anticipate that they will be
able to maintain the current earning rate, they will therefore
be able to retain in reserves a higher proportion of profits
while still giving shareholders a better than average return on
their investment.
Shareholders will benefit from the greater inner strength
which will accrue from higher reserves.
OTHER ACTIVITIES: With returning public confidence in the
nation’s economy during the year several developmental projects
which were slowed down during the credit squeeze period have
started to make progress and in the current year should
contribute more substantially to earnings.
During the year the Corporation disposed of a motel which
it owned at Queanbeyan at a satisfactory profit. This sale has
had the effect, also, of bringing the Corporation into association
with a large motel group and your Directors believe that this
association in the future could prove advantageous to share-
holders.
MANAGEMENT: All the activities of your Directors and Senior
Management during the year have been primarily concerned
with improving the Corporation’s status and maintaining public
confidence in it.
I believe that we can be justified in saying that the manner
in which the Corporation has progressed during the last few
difficult years reflects the greatest credit on the management
and the staff and should warrant the fullest confidence of the
investing public.
I know that you would wish me to convey to the staff your
appreciation of their loyalty, for their co-operation and for
a job well done.
J. DEAN, Chairman of Directors.

INVESTMENT SECTION
Federal’s White Elephant
A mountain seems to have been made
out of the molehill of the auditors’
qualifications to the accounts of Federal
Hotels. Though for all the relatively small
adjustments to stated book values of
certain assets that will have to be made
if, as seems more than likely, the group’s
Broadbeach Hotel realises substantially
less than its £550,000 book value, the
auditors were bound to make their
qualifications and were probably more
than anxious to do so in the light of a
high degree of responsibility recently
shown by the auditors of Reid Murray
Holdings.
To get the matter in perspective it is
important to recognise that the consoli-
dated fixed assets of the Federal Hotels
group were given a book value of
£8,721,609 as at June 30 last and of this
total the value of Broadbeach accounted
for £550,000 or about 6.2 per cent. As
the board has already refused a bid of
£275,000 for the hotel the present
notional loss on a future sale could be
reckoned to be £275,000 at the most.
In fact it may turn out to be only
£250,000, as the chairman told The
Bulletin last week that they will prob-
ably get £300,000 for it.
On the face of it this looks to be
quite a tidy sum to have to write off but
it has to be remembered that Broad-
beach was bought in a packaged deal
which included the purchase of the very
profitable Lennons Hotel in Brisbane. It
has always been regarded by the board
as being somewhat of a white elephant.
What it has lost or stands to lose on the
swings of Broadbeach it has much more
than made up for on the roundabouts of
Lennons, which is now one of its best
money spinners.
By the look of things, when a sale of
Broadbeach is effected, all the present
capital profits reserve of £168,830 looks
destined to disappear from the left side
of the accounts and the group will also
probably have to throw in most of the
£131,858 credited to the assets revalua-
tion reserve taken in as profit on the
original purchase of the hotel.
Assuming a loss of £250,000 has to
be written off on Broadbeach this would
still leave total reserves of £976,424 as
against paid capital of £3,626,328.
So shareholders needn’t lose much
sleep over the auditors’ qualifications
even if in their waking moments they
should ponder the drift in profits of the
group as a whole from £273,669 to
£209,816 last year, the devil in the piece
being Menzies and the other two hotels
in Melbourne where, if competition in
the hotel industry is particularly fierce,
Federal has taken the necessary steps to
meet it and expects an upward trend in
business in the current year.
The group reports that a satisfactory
profit was made from its suburban hotel
at Coburg acquired last December and
that because of the need to conserve re-
sources didn’t go ahead with tentative
arrangements to purchase a second
suburban hotel.

7.7 p.c. and show an earnings yield at
13.2 p.c.
Investors have always tended to
emphasise their considerable variation in
esteem of the large and small financiers.
Despite eight promising years of 121 p.c.
payments, Cambridge levels did not go
above Bs. 6d. in the last two years and
struck a low at ss. 3d. late in 1962.
The company then was enduring a
rash of rumors concerning liquidity and
alleged harmful effects from the winding-
up of estate agent G. B. Eggers, in which
it held a small capital interest. Directors
found no difficulty in dispelling the
liquidity gossip They were also able to
add that the Eggers connection had
actually fetched along useful mortgage
business.
A sensibly - judged prudence has
decided upon a 10 p.c. dividend rate
from the current year on. Directors wish
to build internal strength, perhaps a little
neglected as expansion made it “neces-
sary at various times to increase paid-up
capital as a base for increased borrow-
ings”.
No halt in earning rate should occur,
though this did edge down from 18.6 to
17.2 p.c. in 1962-63 even on a 26 p.c.
profit advance. Yet directors, as other
observers, must take notice of a situation
displaying capital up from £175,000 to
£1,493,231 between 1959 and 1963 while
reserves were only able to be lifted from
£20,000 to £413,626.
There’s also a rather sizeable £240,682
of debenture and note expenses still
among intangibles The case for realistic
strengthening is properly made.
The latest report reinforces directors’
claim to have “sustained a policy of
constant and higher than average state
of liquidity”. Redemption or repayment
of £1,256,476 debentures maturing on
June 30, 1964, is provided for. That
represents the corporation’s first issue
and all subsequent issues stagger maturity
dates.
Of present outstandings, £13,442,372
are secured by real estate mortgages,
leaving only £2,678,016 in hire purchase
and secured loans. “Independent valua-
tions of real estate securities exceed the
principal outstanding by more than
£3 million” and presumably market
valuation could be even better Bad
debts remain “quite remarkably small”.
Cambridge’s market image may im-
prove as the directors’ message sinks in.

years’ dredging period is expected to
start in January, 1964.
The area “together with our lease on
Hammonds Gully will allow the dredge
to operate profitably for a period of up
to 10 years providing today’s relation-
ship between the price of tin and oper-
ating costs is maintained,” the annual
report considers.
On the strength of these prospects in
train the markets have cheerfully kept
the 20s shares close to 18s 6d, absorbing
1962-63’s <£7746 loss and directors’ as-
sertion that, following payment of
1961-62 preference arrears since balance
date, “no further dividend payment can
be recommended at present.” Similar
anticipation had lifted the shares to
18s 9d late in August, though there were
lapses afterwards.
Reserve accounts were not drawn on
in the year to June 30 and the company
looks able to handle its coming and
vital moves. Shareholders’ funds stand at
£692,479, with capital (ordinary and
preference) £326,000.
Directors relish the more favourable
trend in world tin prices after America
defined its policy of stockpile reduction.
Apart from the present unsettlement
stemming from Indonesia, world con-
sumption would appear to be staying
ahead of production for some time yet.
Both Tableland’s directors and share-
holders must be itching to reap their
advantages.
Larke’s “Honesty and Vision”
TI/lotor industrialist and precision
engineer Larke Consolidated In-
dustries Ltd confides to shareholders and
employees that it is looking for an
additional business to add to the group,
in order to improve overall profit and
security.
Since 1956, when one motor vehicle
franchise was the main source of income,
the group has diversified along the
soundest lines.
Total funds are currently invested
34 p.c. in vehicle manufacture, assembly
and general engineering; 23 p.c. in
vehicle distribution; 16 p.c. in product
manufacture; 13 p.c. in motor parts;
10 p.c. in a Fiat manufacture and supply
concession; 3 p.c. in investments; and
1 p.c. in building and construction.
One subsidiary is the largest indepen-
dent contract producer of motor vehicles
in Australia. It made many different
models for five manufacturers in 1962-
63, demanding managerial skill of a high
order.
Each subsidiary aims to keep pace
with the expected growth in the Aus-
tralian economy and in its own particular
industry.
The year to June brought a 93 p.c.
increase in profit, which gave an earning
rate of 28.1 p.c. on capital and 10.6 p.c.
on shareholders’ funds. Sales rose 30.5
p.c. Directors predict “favorable” results
for 1963-64.
The frankness and the benevolent
tenor of the annual report should be an
inspiration to all associated with the
company and set a lofty standard of re-
porting for all public companies.
Smoothing Ansett’s Flight
An income return of 7.1 p.c. and earn-
ings yield of 14.7 p.c. is rare indeed
for a stock that has paid 10 p.c. for the
last eight years.
Yet the market has kept distinct reser-
vations about Ansett Transport Industries
Ltd after it fell by the wayside in 1951-52
and incurred a loss.
The company has climbed out of that
air pocket, and the 1961 Airline Agree-
ment Act has rationalised the competition
between TAA and Ansett-ANA.
The 22 p.c. rise in profit to £1,275,370
in the year to June was after writing off
all costs in connection with the com-
pany’s successful application for Mel-
bourne’s third commercial TV licence.
But, and this is a big but, it was after
minimal tax of £36,395.
Ansett has been gliding along for years
paying almost nothing to the Tax Com-
missioner, apparently because of enor-
mous losses accumulated by ANA, which
it bought in 1957 for £3.3 million cash.
A provision for future tax has been
built up to £865,323 by profit appropri-
ations. This will cushion the impact of
normal tax assessments which, directors
indicated in 1961-62 accounts, would
arrive in the late ’6os.
Mr Ansett could be more explicit and
tell shareholders precisely the amount of
tax losses carried forward at July 1, 1963.
Otherwise clouds of doubt must en-
shroud the company’s investment status,
particularly as establishment costs for
the TV station could severely starin re-
sources in the next couple of years.
A Little Extra Pile
'C , inal result of Carpet Manufacturers
A for the last year to June 30 was
a profit of £98,142 after £89,409 tax pro-
vision, and £128,818 depreciation. The
profit increase of £3444 over 1961-62
encouraged directors to move the divi-
dend from 6 p.c. to 8 p.c.
Sales for 1962-63 were at a record
level, but with some tapering off in
the last quarter. Directors see encourag-
ing signs now of greater interest and ac-
tivity.
In line with technical adjustments on
the market generally, Carpet Manufac-
turers shares eased back to 255., where
the yield is 6.4 p.c.


AUSTRALIAN UNITED CORPORATION LIMITED
Address by the Chairman, Sir lan Potter, to the Shareholders at the
Annual Meeting of the Company on Monday, 30th September, 7963
It is with pleasure that I submit to you
a motion for the adoption of the sixth
Balance Sheet and supporting Accounts of
Australian United Corporation Limited,
together with the Reports of the Directors
and Auditors.
Before discussing the Accounts in detail,
I should like to refer to an event of special
significance to your Company which took
place during the year under review,
namely, the merging into the A.U.C. Group
of The Anglo-Australian Corporation Pty.
Limited.
For many years a close and valuable
business relationship had existed between
your Company and The Anglo-Australian
Corporation a nd its principal sponsors,
Lazard Bros. & Co. Limited and Morgan
Grenfell & Co. Limited of London. More
recently, Lazard Freres & Co. and Morgan
Guaranty International Finance Corpora-
tion of New York also became share-
holders in The Anglo-Australian Corpora-
tion. It was not unnatural, therefore, for
your Directors and the sponsors of The
Anglo-Australian Corporation to consider
the benefits which could become available
to all parties from integration of their
respective interests in Australia. After
lengthy discussion and negotiation a
Merger Agreement was completed on Ist
April, 1963, as a result of which A.U.C.
acquired the whole of the issued capital
of The Anglo-Australian Corporation and,
partly in exchange for that capital and
partly for cash, the sponsors of The
Anglo-Australian Corporation acquired a
35% interest in A.U.C. All parties to the
transaction were satisfied that this was
an equitable arrangement and I am sure
shareholders will agree with me that the
introduction, as members of A.U.C., of
these four long-established and important
international banking houses gives added
strength to our Company.
Following completion of the Merger
Agreement, The Rt. Hon. Lord Catto,
Messrs. D. B. Lewington, A. D. Marris,
S. C. G. Macindoe, N. S. Young and E.
P. Harty were invited by your Directors to
join the Board of A.U.C. Again, i am
sure shareholders will agree with me that
our Company is fortunate to have the
benefit of the wide experience and special-
ised knowledge of these gentlemen.
I should like now to turn to the
Accounts.
Profits and Dividends:
The Consolidated Net Profit for the
year ended 30th June, 1963, is £613,756
compared with £557,102 for the previous
year. Of this profit, £564,539 remains for
Australian United Corporation after allow-
ing for the interests of minority share-
holders in the profits of subsidiary com-
panies; the comparable amount last year
was £473,393.
An interim dividend of 5% on the
Ordinary and Preference capital was paid
on sth April, 1963, and the fixed dividend
of 5% on the Preference capital was paid
on 14th June, 1963. A final dividend of
5% on the Preference capital and on the
increased Ordinary capital has been de-
clared payable on 30th September, 1963.
The total dividend requirement for the
year under review was £138,437 which ab-
sorbed less than 25% of the Consolidated
Net Profit remaining for Australian United
Corporation after allowing for the inter-
ests of minority shareholders in the profits
of subsidiary companies. As a consequence,
the Reserves and Unappropriated Profits
attributable to Australian United Corpora-
tion were augmented by £426,102 out of
the year’s profits. After minor adjust-
ments the Consolidated Profit and Loss
Appropriation Account stands at £1,194,763
compared with £841,435 last year.
Issued Capital and Shareholders’ Funds:
During the year a number of important
changes took place in the issued capital
and shareholders’ funds of the Company.
In December, 1962, the capital recon-
struction to which i referred at the last
Annual Meeting became effective and
issued Preference shares of 1/3 each and
issued “B” Ordinary shares of 1/3 each
were respectively converted to fully paid
Preference shares of 10/- each and fully
paid Ordinary shares of 10/- each. As a
consequence, Specific Reserves of £430,500
were freed and transferred to General
Reserve. At the same time a one-for-ten
Bonus Issue of new fully paid Ordinary
shares was made to the holders of the
Preference capital and the old Ordinary
capital of the Company.
At the last Annual Meeting, I also re-
ferred to an Agreement which had been
reached with the Bank of New South
Wales for the acquisition by A.U.C. of
the Bank’s minority shareholding in Aus-
tralian United Development Pty. Limited.
In terms of that Agreement, 100,000 fully
paid Ordinary shares of 10/- each in the
Company were, in February of this year,
issued to the Bank of New South Wales
in exchange for the Bank’s holding of
200,000 fully paid Ordinary shares of £1
each in Australian United Development
Pty. Limited which thereupon became a
wholly owned subsidiary of A.U.C.
Earlier in this address, I have referred
to the acquisition by the Lazard and
Morgan Companies of a 35% interest in
the issued capital of the Company. This
arrangement was effected on Ist April,
1963, by the issue of 1,033,158 fully paid
Ordinary shares of 10/- each partly in
exchange for the share capital of The
Anglo-Australian Corporation and partly
for cash.
As a result of the capital reconstruction
and the new issues referred to above, the
capital of the Company increased during
the year from £971,687 to £1,609,654 (com-
prising 468,400 fully paid 5% Cumulative
Participating Preference shares of 10/-
each and 2,750,908 fully paid Ordinary
shares of 10/- each) and the Share Pre-
mium Reserve increased from £73,816 to
£960,169.
In discussing the profit for the year,
I have already referred to the increase
in the Profit and Loss Appropriation
Account which took place during the year.
I should like now to touch on other
changes in items of the shareholders’
funds of the Company.
The Assets Revaluation Reserve of
£48,112 represents the balance remaining
in that account after providing for the
one-for-ten Bonus Issue of Ordinary
shares to which I have referred earlier.
The Reserve itself was created during the
year from a revaluation of certain assets
of A.U.C. which were not acquired for
the purpose of resale at a profit. The
Capital Profits Reserve increased by
£14,496 which was the profit arising from
the sale of one of the Company’s capital
assets and the increase in General Re-
serve was largely due to the freeing of
Specific Reserves of £430,500 resulting from
the conversion of 1/3 Preference and
Ordinary shares to 10/- Preference and
Ordinary shares to which I have already
made reference.
The Reserve on Consolidation has in-
creased from £235,708 to £1,012,768. Re-
serves arising as a result of consolidating
the Balance Sheets of a parent company
with its wholly and partly owned subsidi-
aries might broadly be stated to comprise
the difference between the cost to a parent
company of its investment in subsidiaries
and the net worth of those subsidiaries.
As Reserves on Consolidation can be ex-
pected to fluctuate from year to year with
changes in the net worth of subsidiaries,
I wish to draw the attention of share-
holders to the fact that the greatest part
of the increase in the Reserve on Con-
solidation shown in the Accounts we were
discussing arises from the acquisition by
A.U.C. of all the issued capital of Sargood
Gardiner Limited during the last financial
year, and as the assets of that subsidiary
are realised during the current and future
financial years, the reserve arising from
the consolidation of A.U.C. and its sub-
sidiaries is expected to be substantially
reduced with a consequent reduction in
the total A.U.C. Group Shareholders’
Funds. In other words, a large part of
the increase in Reserves on Consolidation
due to the Sargood Gardiner purchase is
transitory, being dependent upon the final
result after realisation of the Sargood
assets.
I should also refer to the effect on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the
acquisition of a controlling interest in
Ring Grip Limited, which took place dur-
ing the year under review.
Apart from Shareholders’ Funds, the
principal items in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet affected by these acquisi-
tions are Interest of Outside Share-
holders, Registered Unsecured Notes, Pro-
vision for Superannuation and Long Ser-
vice Leave, Trade Creditors, Long Term
Liabilities, Stock on Hand, Trade and
Other Debtors, Freeholds, Leaseholds and
Plant and Equipment.
Premises:
Shareholders will be interested to know
that the Corporation has acquired the
premises formerly occupied by the Com-
mercial Union Assurance Company of
Australia Limited of 413 Collins Street,
Melbourne. Early in the New Year, it is
expected that the whole of the Melbourne
operations of the A.U.C. will be trans-
ferred to the new building. Your Directors
regard it as most desirable that the Cor-
poration should have its own premises,
and that the building that has been
acquired is very suitable for our purposes.
I shall now review briefly the operations
of our main subsidiary and associated
companies.
Australian United Enterprises Pty.
Limited:
This subsidiary increased the book value
of its portfolio by approximately £250,000
during the year and at 30th June, 1963,
the market value of the portfolio exceeded
book value by £345,306.
While it remains the policy of the Com-
pany to acquire substantial interests in
securities which appear to have attractive
medium and long term possibilities and
to hold those securities on a long-term
basis, your Directors, during the year
under review, decided that the Company
should also participate in the benefits
which become available from short-term
holding of securities. To that degree,
therefore, the policy of this subsidiary has
undergone a change.
I am pleased to report that adjustments
to the Company’s portfolio during the year
realised a surplus.
Australian United Underwriting Co. Pty.
Limited:
I have previously reminded shareholders
that the volume of underwriting business
done in any one year is closely related to
industrial activity and to circumstances in
the capital market during that year. The
year under review was notably one in
which a rather restricted growth in indus-
trial activity combined with a high degree
of internal liquidity, and it is to be ex-
pected that under conditions such as these
the volume of underwriting business avail-


able tends to fall off. This subsidiary
nevertheless was actively engaged through-
out the year and its income contributed
substantially to the income of the A.U.C.
Group, though on a lower scale than
last year.
Following the merging into the A.U.C.
Group of The Anglo-Australian Corpora-
tion on Ist April, 1963, the benefits of
underwriting and placing business previ-
ously carried on by The Anglo-Australian
Corporation will accrue to this Company
in the future.
United Discount Company of Australia
Limited:
This subsidiary has had a profitable
year although the results were somewhat
below those for 1962.
The Australian financial system was
very liquid throughout the year but it
appears that to a substantial extent funds
were diverted to avenues paying higher
rates than the established Short Term
Money Market. The result was that the
cost of money to that Market did not
reduce in line with the lower yields on
Commonwealth Government Securities
which comprise the earning assets of the
approved Short Term Dealers.
For reasons mentioned in my address
last year, your Directors have appropri-
ated a further £50,000 from tax paid profits
to the Investment Fluctuation Reserve
which now stands in the Balance Sheet of
this subsidiary at £150,000.
During the year under review, further
moderate increases in permitted levels of
operation were approved for Dealer Com-
panies including United Discount Com-
pany of Australia Limited. Your Directors
feel that circumstances should shortly per-
mit the removal of official limitations on
the size of the Market. We appreciate
the need for these ceilings in the initial
stages of the Market’s establishment but
at this stage we believe that it can oper-
ate more effectively if it is not restricted
in regard to volume.
We continue to investigate the advant-
ages which we are satisfied would accrue
if the Short Term Money Market were
permitted to deal in Commercial Bills
and Semi-Governmental Securities. Such
a development, we feel, could benefit both
the Money Market and the business com-
munity.
Australian United Acceptance Limited:
This subsidiary, as shareholders know,
deals in Short Term Commercial Paper.
From the volume of sound business
offered to the Company, your Directors
are satisfied that it has a most useful
function to perform in those parts of the
Short Term field not covered by the
Official Market.
Australian United Acceptance Limited
continues to operate profitably, and its
resources were fully employed in the year
under review.
Australian United Projects Pty. Limited:
The activities of this Company have
been concentrated principally on planning
and developing the major building opera-
tion in Collins and Elizabeth Streets in
the City of Melbourne to which I referred
in my address last year. Since the close
of the 1963 financial year, arrangements
for financing this development, at an esti-
mated cost of £2,300,000, have been com-
pleted with an important lending institu-
tion and work is now proceeding on the
site. This subsidiary already owned a
large part of the land upon which the
development is to be carried out and with
the conversion of its investment in that
land into equity of the development com-
pany, it is expected that little, if any,
further cash will need to be provided by
the A.U.C. Group to bring the scheme to
completion.
The Company also played a part, jointly
with the Victorian Employers’ Federa-
tion, in promoting the Princes Gate pro-
ject for roofing part of the Flinders
Street railway yards in the City of Mel-
bourne. No substantial capital outlay is
required of A.U.C. in this project. •
Australian United Development Pty.
Limited:
I have mentioned earlier that the min-
ority interest of the Bank of New South
Wales in this subsidiary was acquired
during the year and the Company is now
a wholly owned subsidiary of the A.U.C.
Group. Its consolidated assets increased
by approximately £450,000 during the year
largely as the result of the increase in
its investment in the electrical equipment
manufacturer, Ring Grip Limited, to the
extent that the Company has become a
partly owned subsidiary of the A.U.C.
Group, and of further equity investment
in L. M. Ericsson Pty. Limited which,
shareholders will remember, is a Company
formed to manufacture in Australia tele-
phone equipment for the Australian Post
Office and is owned as to 60% by the
L. M. Ericsson Telephone Company of
Sweden and as to 40% by Australian
United Development.
As foreshadowed in my address to you
last year, the policy of this subsidiary is
now to allow advances to run off as
they mature and to use the funds realised
either in building up its investments in
substantial enterprises or in other activi-
ties of the A.U.C. Group.
The Anglo-Australian Corporation Pty.
Limited:
Apart from a limited number of special-
ised functions which it is considered con-
venient to continue in the name of The
Anglo-Australian Corporation, the prin-
cipal activities of this Company have since
Ist April, 1963, been transferred to A.U.C.
Glanvill Enthoven & Co. (Australasia)
Pty. Ltd.:
Last year, I referred to our intention to
dispose of our holding in j. H. Minet
Superannuation Services Pty. Limited and
this was negotiated during the year under
review.
Our interests in the insurance broking
field are now concentrated in Glanvill
Enthoven & Co. (Australasia) Pty. Ltd.,
which is owned 50% by A.U.C. and 50%
by Glanvill Enthoven & Co. Limited of
London. The Company has established a
complete range of insurance service in
Australia and we look forward to the busi-
ness of our partnership with Glanvill
Enthoven developing rapidly and profit-
ably.
Sargood Gardiner Limited:
During February this year A.U.C. made
an offer to acquire for cash all the issued
capital of Sargood Gardiner Limited and,
by the end of March, had received suffici-
ent acceptances to control the Company.
It was subsequently decided that the
Company should cease trading and that
an orderly realisation of its assets should
begin. With the full co-operation of the
Directors and staff, rapid progress has
been made in disposing of the Company’s
trading assets and its principal freehold
property in Melbourne. Negotiations are
in hand for disposal of the remaining
assets including two large freehold pro-
perties in Sydney.
Investors’ Services Limited:
The market value of the Funds managed
by this Company now approaches
£3,000,000. The Australian Capital Funds
portfolios have advanced with the general
market improvement but, as was to be
expected in the circumstances of the year
under review, the greater part of new
money flowing to the Funds during the
year was attracted to the Australian
Income Fund. It can be expected that
Investors’ Services Limited will benefit
from the continued growth in the amount
of savings being directed toward unit
trust and mutual fund investments in
Australia.
General:
Shareholders may, I think, look back on
the past year with satisfaction. The
A.U.C. Group further consolidated its posi-
tion in the financial system of the country
and strengthened its associations with
important institutions in London and
New York. The profit for the year con-
siderably exceeded that of last year and
the condition of the Group is sound. I
must, however, again remind shareholders
that the profitability of the A.U.C. Group
is to a very large extent dependent upon
the state of the Australian economy as
a whole and while it is true that the
spread of the Group’s activities gives us
balance, I must repeat the statement I
have made in previous years that it would
be unwise to assume that the rate of
profits achieved in the past will continue
indefinitely.
Economic Prospects:
Most of the recognised indicators point
to a continuation of the present prosperity
in Australia. The Gross National Product
is steadily increasing; the employment
position shows a consistent improvement;
with a few exceptions, there is increasing
activity in manufacture; rural production
shows a substantial increase, both quanti-
tatively and in value; and the external
position of the economy is sound.
One of the most reassuring aspects of
the economic situation in the last two
years has been the stability in costs. Pro-
duction costs are of great significance if
Australia is to extend its export trade into
manufactures, which seems inevitable in
the light of the limitations to the external
demand for food and even for staple pro-
ducts like wool and metals.
It seems likely that the continued com-
petitive impact of imports will keep Aus-
tralian industry on its toes. Because of
our less secure position in international
trade (despite Britain’s exclusion from the
Common Market), it is probable that Aus-
tralia’s tariff policy will be more liberal
to imports than it has been in the past.
The present situation in which Australian
manufacturers must sell alongside import-
ed products may have some beneficial
effects in sustaining a consciousness re-
garding costs. Nevertheless, this policy
must be carefully balanced against the
long-range objective of expanding Austra-
lian industry, so as to absorb the popula-
tion increase so vital to our future.
A Corporation such as the A.U.C. is
naturally most interested in the current
controversy regarding the use of overseas
capital in Australia. A developing country
like ours has an urgent need for external
capital, otherwise our needs for imported
capital goods would create constant im-
balance in our external trade. On the
level of Government borrowing, there is
no controversy. The relatively small
amount we are able to borrow abroad pro-
vides a welcome addition to our inter-
national balances and relieves the pressure
on the internal security market.
It is in the sphere of private industry
that the question of overseas capital is
controversial. It should be stated at once
that without the enterprise and technical
background of many important overseas
companies established here, Australia’s
industrial set-up would be much inferior
to the wide array of activities that it
now includes. It would be wrong to
think that all the overseas companies
operating in Australia have had easy
success. Most of them have had to pass
through a phase of unprofitableness and
heavy losses. Australian participation in
the share capital of these companies,
where it has been offered, has not always
been beneficial to the Australian investor.
It is a little unfair to press for the right
to invest only in those companies that
succeed. However, there is no doubt of
the sincerity of the desire of Australians
as a whole for local participation in the
share capital of important overseas busi-
nesses established here, and those com-
panies that offer it will undoubtedly en-
hance their public relations.
A further aspect of the matter is the
purchase by overseas interests of Austra-
lian businesses as an alternative to setting
up operations de novo. This has some
undesirable aspects, especially if it is
carried to the limits that it has been in
Canada. But even here, care should be
taken to discriminate between the pur-

The other remaining point of interest
to which I should refer is the continuing
high liquidity in the Australian economy.
Various factors have contributed to this,
including the reduced interest in equity
shares for investment, the tendency of
consumers to save rather than to spend,
and the buoyant state of international
reserves. In the result, there has been
a steady decline in interest rates which,
for the time being, seems likely to con-
tinue. No doubt, in due course, continu-

Staff:
Your Directors wish to place on record
their appreciation of the work done by
the Staff and I am sure shareholders will
join with me in thanking the Staff for
their continued loyalty and efficiency
throughout the year.
Monier Reinforces
T'Vecision of Concrete Industries (Mon-
ier) directors to recommend a total
dividend of 6$ p.c. from 1962-63 earn-
ings of 9.3 p.c. on capital was cautious.
But shareholders should be impressed
by present trading and prospects, and
grateful that the directors are proceeding
with care.
In the last 12 months “considerable
funds” were spent on expansion pro-
grammes to increase overall future profit-
ability. Directors declare that these are
now proving effective. Given a continu-
ation of this trend results for 1963-64
should show "‘substantial” improvement.
Already profits for the first three
months of the new year are “substantially
in excess ’ of last year's corresponding
period, and “considerable” orders are
held.
The company’s market reputation was
severely shaken by news of losses ex-
ceeding £lOO,OOO which had to be writ-
ten off civil engineering contracts, re-
ducing 1962-63 profits and compelling
a drastic dividend cut.
With the ss. shares now commanding
about Bs. 9d., the market calculates that
the company will not err again and that
some consolidation is now taking place.
Chamberlain In High Gear
The WA tractor and agricultural
implement maker Chamberlain Hold-
ings Ltd had tax relief from pre-1959
losses of the operating company during
the financial year to June 29, 1963.
Tax provision, which would other-
wise have been about £124,000, was only
£75.000, leaving a consolidated net of
£214,262. Turnover soared from £4.9
million to a record £5.4 million.
The impressive earning rate of 39.0
p.c. may be hard to repeat, as future
profits will be subject to normal tax
rates.
The holding company was formed late
in 1962, w’ith an initial capital of
£550,000 in ss. shares AUC took up a
25 p.c. interest.
Shares are quoted on Perth and Mel-
bourne Exchanges at around 11s. 4d.,
where the present yield on a 10 p.c.
dividend rate is 4.4 p.c., and earnings
yield 17.2 p.c.
Meat Margins Sliced
ross margins of the Sydney meat

Customlife is increasing
this man’s life assurance policy
That’s what we mean by “Guaranteed Insurability”!
Four years ago, at age 36, this
man took out a Customlife policy,
with guaranteed insurability.
Today, although stricken with a
heart attack, he is exercising his
option to increase his cover by
£5,000 —the amount of his
original insurance.
It is granted without question.
Without penalty rate.
This option, unique to Customlife
Assurance Limited, is possible
only through our “Guaranteed
Insurability.” Briefly, it guaran-
tees you the right to buy more life
assurance periodically without
the need for further medical
examination —regardless of your
state of health at the option dates.
Customlife realises that one cannot
depend on constant good health, and,
realising this, provides for your protection
in the event of any illness at any time.
Let’s look at specifics:
From birth to age 40, it is possible for
you to increase the cover on your life
five times. Option dates exist at ages 24,
28, 32, 36 and 40 to increase cover by
an amount not exceeding the original sum
assured . . . which can be up to £5,000.
Thus, taking advantage of all options,
you have a maximum amount purchas-
able of £30,000, with only the one
medical examination when the initial
policy is taken out.
m
Even if you should delay to, say, age 35,
you still have two further option dates.
Perhaps you are thirty now; you have a
young family -and a responsibility for
their future and your own. You can
take out an initial policy for any amount
up to £5,000, and increase it as you will
at the option dates, with no fear of
refusal on medical grounds.
The coverage, of course, applies to
women, too. The same complete protec-
tion applies to you as a career woman,
or a young wife sharing family responsi-
bilities.
This is worry-free security, enabling you
to plan for the future with a new
confidence.
You can have more specific details of
this unique Life Assurance plan by con-
tacting your nearest Customlife office
(listed below). If you have delayed buy-
ing life assurance, this may be the wisest
time for you to move. Customlife will
tailor a policy to your requirements
immediately.

rated on a 5.7 p.c. yield, selling for 6s. 7d.

able cover for the unchanged dividend of

The international interest in Australian
food companies must affect market think-
ing on this stock.
Quiet Furnishing Specialist
A small reduction in absolute profit
(from £35,955 to £34,591) brought
a significant fall in E. A. Greenwood’s
earning rate in the latest year to June 30.
It is now 30 p.c. on average capital
employed, compared with 35.9 p.c. last
year.
Results include six months’ trading
of A. Hall, the furniture retailer. A
branch store was opened at Liverpool,
with attendant establishment costs.
The parent company, a softgoods
wholesaler, has quietly built a reputation
over the years for very high earnings
in relation to capital.
Shareholders should not allow the
market to register any disappointment in
the group result, because sales, not
including A. Hall, were 20 p.c. higher
in the September, 1963, quarter than
in 1962.

Sugar Shares on a Spiral
Opeak of the devil, last week. All those
sugar shares have taken off on a
crazy spiral again.
Perhaps it is the strongly rising world
sugar price (up £stglo in the last week
to £stgBo) that touched it off. But more
likely it is the strong possibility of a
favorable report by the committee in-
quiring into the Australian sugar indus-
try. The report, to be released shortly,
will probably state that the future pros-
pects of the industry warrant a substan-
tial increase in production.
Looking immediately ahead, the cur-
rent year should be a bonanza. Whilst
it is expected that the size of the crop
will be about the same as last year's
record 1,800,000 tons in Australia and
250,000 tons in Fiji, the total income
return from the raw sugar should be
some 50 p.c. higher. It has been esti-
mated that the millers’ share in this price
increase is about 33 1/3 p.c.
The only miller left that has not
wildly reacted is the daddy of them all
CSR. Besides being the refiner of
sugar in Australia and New Zealand, it
is by far the largest miller. About 600,000
tons are expected to pass through its
mills in Australia and Fiji.
The building materials division should
also turn in a useful profit in the cur-
rent year. In the annual report covering
the 1962-63 year, directors described the
result for this division as being “sub-
stantially better” than the previous year.
Buying CSR also fits into my theme of
buying building stocks. My reasoning was
a little slower than the market. From 68s.
on Tuesday the share had moved to 71s.
on the Thursday before I acted.
On the same day I covered the Aus-
tralian Factors. The element of time is
foremost in any shorting transaction.
Four weeks was a long wait, but the
shares finally behaved themselves by
falling to 6s. 6d. The transaction showed
a profit of £ll.
It seems somewhat small against the
total increase of about £5OO in the port-
folio this week. My thanks go to Hani-
mex, Gibson and Howes, Plastic Coat-
ings, Pacific Island Mines and ISAS
(NSW).
F>erhaps if I still had General Indus-
tries in the portfolio, I would not be
so content. In May, the shareholders of
that company were assured of a substan-
tial improvement in trading only to be
bluntly told four months later that
trading has been most difficult for the
six months ending 30th June.
We all know that General Industries
has had its troubles. If the shareholder
is not getting any return from his invest-
ment at least he is entitled to know the
true progress of the company. Company
reporting, or should I say mis-reporting,
of this nature can only do harm to the
investor’s confidence. The directors
should feel it their duty towards share-
holders to enlarge on this surprising in-
terim report.
Back to more personal matters, namely
the selling out of a few of the disappoint-
ments in the portfolio.
First to go was Vesta at a loss of £3O.
Despite its re-organisation, it will be a
couple of years before reasonable pro-
fits can be expected.
The other stock, Borg Warner, only
purchased a couple of weeks ago, moved
up a little but then came straight back
to 265. 6d. The loss here was £9.
Far outweighing these losses was the
profit of £132 on the sale of 500 Pacific
Island Mines options at 7s 6d. This leaves
me with a balance of 500.
Transactions for this week were:
SOLD
1000 Vesta, 3/- £l4l
200 Borg Warner, 26/6 £261
500 Pacific Island Mines, 7/6 £lB2
BOUGHT
400 Australian Factors, 6/6 . £135
200 CSR, 71/- r .„. £721
With a total sugar investment of over
£2,300, I am pushed back into a debit
of £332. Those United Telecasters should
be listed shortly. They bear watching.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Repco’s Impressive Expansion
can be no doubt that Repco Ltd
A dominates the field in the manu-
facture and distribution of components
for the automotive industry. Its com-
petitors who are also public listed com-
panies have not been able in recent years
to show the same dynamism as Repco
and consequently their shares are not as
highly priced. It may perhaps be un-
realistic to make the comparisons because
companies do not necessarily compete
in all areas and in fact may be comple-
mentary in some. Nevertheless, one can-
not help noting that Repco’s shares are
selling between 19s. 6d. and 205., showing
a dividend yield of 3.8 p.c. from the 15
p.c. dividend which is covered 1.6 times,
but Automotive Components’ shares are
selling at Bs. 6d. to show a dividend yield
of 5-9 p.c. from the 10 p.c. dividend
which appears, from the preliminary an-
nouncement, to be covered 1.3 times.
Expressed in terms of price/earnings
ratios, Repco is selling at 16.4 times
earnings while Automotive Components
is selling at 13.0 times earnings.
It is only fair to say that in the case
of both Automotive Components and
Duly and Hansford (as well as some
other small companies), the 1960-61 and
1961-62 years caused some problems
which involved a reduction in their divi-
dend rates from the 1959-60 levels.
Repco, on the other hand, seems to have
avoided these troubles, as over these two
years it actually increased its dividend
rate and the latest increase means that
on a per share basis dividend income is
now 50 p.c. higher than it was two years
ago.
Ane cannot help being impressed by the
expansion that has taken place in the
group over the last five years. A num-
ber of companies were acquired in 1959-
60 and others in 1960-61. This pro-
gramme and, no doubt, other develop-
ments have involved a substantial in-
crease in capital employed which has
risen from just over £6.5 million at the
end of the 1957-58 year to over £16.8
million at June 30 last. Despite this
increase of over 150 p.c. the actual re-
turn on capital, as measured by net profit
before tax, depreciation and interest on
long term debt has increased from about
£1.3 million to £3.8 million or by over
190 p.c.
The latest balance sheet lists 39 sub-
sidiary and associate companies exclud-
ing non-operating companies and two
companies under the heading of “Re-
search and Apprentice Training”. Also
listed are 21 overseas companies 10 in
Great Britain and Europe and 11 in the
USA with whom manufacturing under
licence agreements are currently in force.
The USA companies include the Bendix
Corporation and Borg-Warner Interna-
tional Corporation, both of whom have
other interests in Australia.
A further look at the broad groupings
of the subsidiaries gives an indication
of the range of automotive parts covered,
namely engine parts, brakes and trans-
missions as well as garage equipment.
Backing up these production divisions is
the merchandising and automotive en-
gineering group. Outside the automotive
area, in some ways, is the industrial ser-
vice and machine tool groups.
The associated companies are estab-
lished not only in Australia but also in
New Zealand and India.
Tn view of the range of products and
services one feels that the best
indicator of Repco’s potential should be
the number of vehicles on register.
Expressed with the June 30, 1959, figure
as a base, the trend is as follows:
June 30
1959 1960 1961 1962 J 963
100 107 114 119 128
These figures suggest a rate of growth
around 6 p.c. per annum and it is thought
that over the next five years the rate
should be around 5i p.c.
Using the rate of return on capital
employed for comparison purposes, the
trend of Repco’s figures has been:
Year to June 30
1959 1960 1961 1962 1963
100 113 111 96 112
These figures, however, show that
“profitability”, while it has increased
commendably, has not risen at the same
rate and in some respects appears to fol-
low the trend of new vehicle registrations
which have been as follows:
Year to June 30
1959 1960 1961 1962 1963
100 132 129 94 158
Projections of new vehicle registration
are difficult because they involve making
estimates of “scrappage” rates which do
not show any well-defined trend. Clearly
one can only make a guess at the rate of
increase in profitability but if we assume
that it will only increase at the rate of
2} p.c. per annum in the next five years,
it is possible to see per share earnings
increasing at the average annual com-
pound rate of 3.2 p.c., say. Evidently,
the market is expecting something much
better than this and maybe per share
earnings are expected to increase at the
same rate as they have in the past five
years, i.e. at about 14 p.c. per annum.
It seems to me that dividend income
will need to continue to increase at the
rate of at least 7 p.c. per annum com-
pound over the next 10 years to justify
the present price and it is perhaps worth
noting that from 1953-54 until 1960-61
there was no increase at all in dividend
income. In other words, the 62} p.c.
increase has occurred in the last three
years and if averaged out over the last
ten years on a straight line basis would
amount to just under 5 p.c. per annum.
one cannot overlook
the increase in per share earnings
over the last five years during a difficult
period and during a period of rapid
expansion. Confidence in the Repco
management is well warranted and, for
this factor alone, the shares seem worth
their present price, even if one might
have some reservations about paying any
more than 20s. for them.
Top Of The League
"C'or all their recent stubbornness to
proceed to greater heights Austra-
lian ordinary share prices are well in the
first four in the international league
this year. At the way things were going
up to the end of last month they should
get a double chance, being in second
place only to Sweden where share prices
have risen by 23.4 p.c. compared with
18.2 p.c. in Australia.
These two are far ahead on points of
their nearest rivals, Western Germany
up 12.3 p.c., the US 11.8 p.c., Holland
10.2 p.c., and Britain 10.3 p.c., though
in all these countries prices have been
moving better than ours in recent weeks.
The only major countries to suffer a
decline in share prices this year are
Austria down 10.9 p.c., Italy 9.9 p.c.,
France 5.7 p.c. and Japan 4.9 p.c.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Pipe Dreams Come True
An inescapable conclusion from read-
ing the annual report of Humes Ltd
is that the management is vigorous,
capable and thoroughly up-to-the-minute
in its thinking.
The directors’ report is informative on
all branches of the company’s activities,
and the accounts are well furnished with
accompanying notes.
Net result of their energies, for the
year to June 30, 1963, was a group profit
of £943,597 (last year £810,747), after
providing £821,962 (£700,597) for tax,
and £786,959 (£724,954) for deprecia-
tion.
The after-tax profit applicable to
Humes, related to average shareholders’
funds, was a very solid 10.6 p.c., com-
pared with 9.5 p.c. in 1961-62 and 10.2
p.c. in 1960-61.
Group sales reached a new record of
£23.2 million, almost £3 million more
than in 1961-62.
Activities are the manufacture of pipes
of concrete, steel, clay, asbestos cement,
and plastic, and related products.
The company, founded in 1910, claims
to be the largest maker of concrete and
steel pipes this side of the equator. Its
success has probably exceeded the
founders’ wildest dreams.
Main contributors to the group’s
1962-63 profit increase were the parent
company and Hume Industries (Far
East) Ltd, which until recently was
owned 67 p.c. by Humes Ltd. The NZ
economy was restricted, so the NZ sub-
sidiary had lower sales and profits.
Australian subsidiaries associated with
the structural steel and housing industries
earned lower profits.
An 18 p.c. lift in parent company
sales plus intense cost consciousness
produced a record parent profit from
trading of £l.l million. This was 8 p.c.
on sales, and selling prices were virtually
stable for the year.
The company has moved into a new
field of rigid PVC pipes, the market for
which is expected to grow fairly rapidly.
Humes has developed a preformed plastic
lining for spun concrete pipes to be
protected by world-wide patents.
The Far Eastern subsidiary altered its
capital from Australian to Malayan
currency, and by June 30, 1963, its
issued capital was $3 million in 5 p.c.
cumulative participating preference shares
and $8.4 million in ordinary stock units.
In August, 1963, $1.5 million in ordinary
stock units was offered to Malayan
residents, and greatly over-subscribed.
A 50-50 venture with Wunderlich to
make Wunder - Hume asbestos pipes
has lost heavily so far (approaching
£400,000 since November 1, 1961).
Although production problems are now
mostly solved, a greater volume of sales
is needed before operations can be profit-
able. This appears the only weak spot in
all Humes’ operations.
Directors predict that sales and profits
of the Australian companies should be
approximately steady for 1963-64, but
that surplus productive capacity would
allow them to meet increased demands.
Overseas companies should produce
higher sales and profits.
As at balance date orders on hand
were £9.7 million (£8 million same time
last year) for the group, including £7.5
million for the parent company.
Capital expenditure in progress or
approved is £475,000 for the parent, and
£964,000 for the whole group. The
parent company is considering sub-
stantial rebuilding of factories to com-
pletely reorganise plant layouts.
Martin Stoneware Pipe Pty, of Bendigo
and Ballarat, is spending £750,000 on
fixed assets. The new Wendouree
factory will be the largest, most modern
clay pipe factory in Australia with a
daily capacity of 100 tons. In full pro-
duction it will treble present output with
longer and better quality pipes.
In the year under review the group
outlayed £1,675,000 for capital ex-
penditure. It was spent on concrete
factories at Auburn (NSW), Alice
Springs, and in WA at Mt Barker and
Kununnurra. Progress was made on the
special steel pipe factory at Corryong
(Vic.) for the £2 million Murray I con-
tract on a new concrete pipe factory at
Pooraka (SA) and with the Adelaide
Trunk sewer contract.
The asbestos cement sheeting factory
at Petaling laya in Malaya was com-
pleted and the erection of a four-metre
asbestos cement pipe factory is under-
way.
In addition, during 1963-64 a new
State office will be built at Keswick (SA),
and a concrete pipe factory is planned
for Tasek in Malaya.
Expenditure planned will be similar
to that incurred in 1962-63. It will be
financed internally.
Apart from minor placements, the
last call for capital was a two-for-five par
issue in 1960-61. Shareholders were

1957-58.
Revaluation of Humes’ holding in the
Singapore subsidiary and capital profits
from the sale of fixed assets increased
group reserves by £170,893 during the
year.
Parent company land and buildings
were independently valued in 1960-61
(certainly a boom year) showing a sur-
plus of about £1 million over the then
book values.
Now on offer at around 835., the
merits of the 20s. shares are widely
recognised although they could be more
popular if a share split was effected.
A bonus should eventually come to
patient holders, as directors show no sign
of augmenting the 14 p.c. dividend rate.
But for the next couple of years the
company will be well occupied with plant
expansion, and probably not anxious to
extend its commitments to shareholders.
Its income is dependent on rent paid
by the managers of the hotel who, under
terms of the sub-lease, receive 25 p.c. of
the gross operating profit. The remaining
75 p.c. goes to the owners.
The Southern Cross is managed by
Intercontinental Hotels Corporation of
Australia Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of the
US Intercontinental group which, in
turn, is owned by Pan American. Inter-
continental put up £600,000 of the
£2m. ordinary capital. The rest of the
finance came from a <£1,884,000 8 p.c.
debenture issue (placed with the Aus-
tralian public by lan Potter & Co., Mel-
bourne), a 51 p.c. loan of £l.lm. (later
reduced to £826,000) from the Export-
Import Bank, of Washington, and the
issue of £450,000 in debentures and
£IOO,OOO unsecured notes at rates up to
71 p.c.
A rough calculation of interest charges
suggests an annual interest bill of
£150,720 on the 8 p.c. debentures,
SOUTHERN CROSS PROPERTIES
Heavy Capital
Commitments
A nyone who ponders on the immense
amount of money now being spent
by various countries on tourism inevit-
ably must conclude that the hotel busi-
ness should enjoy a veritable boom,
provided it can supply the standard of
accommodation demanded these days.
The Hilton group evidently is im-
pressed with the prospects because it
pushed ahead with plans to expand its
chain, and will have 28 hotels in opera-
tion in 1964. One step behind is Inter-
continental Hotels, a subsidiary of Pan
American, which manages or has under
construction 29 Intercontinental hotels
in various countries outside the USA,
including the 435-bedroom Southern
Cross Hotel in Melbourne.
Until the opening of the 650-bedroom
Mandarin Hotel in Hong Kong this year,
the Southern Cross was the largest in
the Intercontinental chain.
Australian shareholders have a vital
interest in the success of the Southern
Cross Hotel. They put up £1.4 million
of the ordinary capital in Southern Cross
Properties Ltd when it was floated in
September, 1959, to build a £sm. hotel
on the old Eastern Market site in Mel-
bourne.
Opened by the Prime Minister in a
blaze of publicity on August 24, 1962,
the Southern Cross yet has to live up to
the prospectus estimates of £1,144,000
gross operating profit on 75 p.c. room
occupancy. This operating profit is vital
to Southern Cross Properties Ltd.,
because it owns the property but does
not operate the hotel.

£47,495 on the 5f p.c. loan, possibly
£40,000 on the other debentures and
notes and perhaps £12,000 in over-
draft interest. This, combined with an
annual rental of £39,750 to the Mel-
bourne City Council (which was not pay-
able before October, 1963), suggests
commitments of around £290,000 before
amortisation, depreciation, or administra-
tive charges.
In fact, preliminary figures announced
at the end of August for the 10 months’
operation to June, 1963, show expenses
of £295,577 before adding £168,133 for
amortisation and depreciation. Inter-
continental paid Southern Cross Proper-
ties £180,169 out of the operating profit
of £196,280 (which is more than 75 p.c.).
But this still left Southern Cross with in-
sufficient to offset expenses and it de-
clared a net loss of £283,541 for the year
after providing £95,322 for amortisation
of leasehold over a 38-year period and
£72,811 for depreciation of plant and
equipment.
If the rental payable to the Melbourne
City Council is not payable until October
1, 1963, presumably the rental for the
first three years to that date must be cal-
culated as a future expense and not in-
cluded in the latest figures disclosed.
And if Intercontinental’s operating
profit is only £196,280 for 10 months
compared with a prospectus estimate of
more than £l.lm. on a 75 p.c. room
occupancy basis, some improvement is
necessary before Southern Cross can
break even. In fact, based on Southern
Cross’ 1962-63 figures of £295,577 ex-
penses and £168,133 amortisation and
depreciation (total £463,710), Intercon-
tinental would need to earn a gross oper-
ating profit of £618,280 before it can
pay £463,710 (75 p.c.) to Southern Cross
Properties Ltd.
Naturally some improvement is ex-
pected on the first year’s results. But the
market for the ss. ordinary shares recent-
ly dipped to 2s. The assets backing is
probably close to 4s. and, to this extent,
the company could be vulnerable to a
takeover were it not for large sharehold-
ing of Intercontinental.
The accounts had not been published
at the time of writing. But if an explana-
tion for that apparently low £196,280
operating profit of Intercontinental is
forthcoming, investors may look forward
to some improvement in results for 1963-
64 ... at least with hopes for increased
cover on operating expenses. Otherwise
the hotel is over-capitalised.
Speculators interested in a long term
punt no doubt will be prepared to take a
risk on the ordinaries at 25., particularly

Lober Pays Higher
Oydney Holden dealer W. H. Lober
Holdings Ltd earned a little more
in 1962-63, year ended June, than in
1961-62. But apart from the boom year
of 1959-60, profits since 1957 have
been remarkably steady.
Dividend has been stepped up in the
latest term from 15 p.c. to 17i p.c.,
payable from earnings of 32 p.c. on
capital.
A return of 6.2 p.c. can be had by a
present purchase of the ss. shares at
about 14s.


THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Farmers Work for Unity
Tuning the host of many voices
A lthough, individually, Australian
farmers may be renowned for their
economy of words, collectively they suf-
fer from having too many voices.
In the old days, the farmer’s lot was
less than ideal because of his geographi-
cal dispersion. With the advent of mod-
ern transport and communications he is
still suffering from a dispersion that is
organisational.
Recent moves in Victoria, however,
give hope that the day may yet arrive
when the farmer's many voices, if not
exactly fused, are at least in tune.
The source of this optimism is an
organisation called the Unity Study
Group. Its chairman, Mr W. Weigall,
a grazier whose impartiality was ac-
ceptable to all parties concerned, an-
nounced after a recent conference of the
group that much progress had been made
towards uniting Victoria’s assortment of
farm organisations.
Sponsors of the group are trying to
bring about a situation where the or-
ganisations participating in discussions
will go into formal liquidation and re-
emerge as commodity sections of a new
autonomous body, the Victorian Far-
mers’ Union.
The new union would have much the
same structure as the present Australian
Primary Producers’ Union, whose nat-
ional pretensions have never got far be-
yond the Victorian border. But it would
not have the opposition that now defeats
the principle on which the APPU is
based.
The group comprises the Victorian
Wheat and Woolgrowers’ Association,
the Victorian Dairyfarmers’ Association,
the Victorian Division of the Australian
Primary Producers’ Union and the Graz-
iers’ Association of Victoria. Provision
has been made for other producer-
organisations to hop on the band-waggon
if they think they would like the ride.
Hitherto, the numerous organisations
to which Victorian farmers are har-
nessed have seldom pulled in the same
direction. Policies have too often been
shaped by rivalry, and where a cause
is not ruined by actual conflict it is
frequently weakened by having to depend
on representation that is piecemeal and
incomplete.
Advocates of unity point to the recent
Budget as an example of what fragmen-
tation is costing the farmer. While or-
ganisations welcomed such concessions
as the £3 a ton subsidy on superphos-
phate, the 20 p.c. investment allowance
on new equipment, and other smaller
pickings, they were united for once in
their opinion that the farmer had got
closer than any other section of the
community to the bottom of Mr Holt’s
barrel.
Commenting on such deficiencies as
the Budget’s failure to provide safe-
guards for farm production to be ex-
panded without running into world sur-
pluses, the secretary of the Victorian
Wheat and Woolgrowers’ Association,
Mr J. S. Bryant, said: “Perhaps the
most significant feature of the Budget
is that it highlights the lack of a farm-
bloc approach by all producers for con-
cessions most required.”
Tle pointed out that other big groups
such as returned soldiers and pen-
sioners came out of the Budget better be-
cause their case was solid and clear. Vic-
torian organisations accustomed to seeing
proposals torn to shreds by hands that are
supposed to be passing them up to
Federal level sigh wistfully at the power
wielded by the farm bloc in the United
States.
At present the outstanding product
of divisions in farm organisation is dis-
agreement on wool promotion and mar-
keting. While this extends to most of
Australia, it is in Victoria that the ques-
tion is most vexed. Here, the graziers
are the nation’s most conservative, the
Australian Primary Producers’ Union the
most vigorous and the small woolgrowers
the most militant.
Amid the talk of unity, however,
some mellowing is going on. An example
of it is the recent metamorphosis in the
thinking of Victorian graziers on wool
marketing.
The oldest of the four organisations
in the group, the Victorian Graziers’
Association, was founded before the
First World War to combat closer settle-
ment. A minimum holding of sheep was
required for membership. Years ago this
condition was relaxed, but until recently
the association remained rigidly against
any change in the free auction system
of marketing wool.
The association’s opponent on this
issue, the Victorian Wheat and Wool-
growers’ Association, which was foun-
ded in 1929, has always insisted that
wool promotion must not be stepped up
until an orderly marketing system has
been implemented, and wants a floor
price incorporated in the present auction
system.
A couple of years ago, the graziers,
in a spasm of agility not to be expected
of such a hoary old fortress of con-
servatism, leap-frogged over the wheat
and woolgrowers to the even more
radical policy of favoring the adoption
of the appraisal system of selling. The
question of marketing is at present the
subject of another inquiry, this time
by an Australian Wool Board committee.
Its report is expected by December, in
time for the Wool Industry Conference’s
January discussion on raising the wool
promotion levy.
Of the other two organisations in the
quartet the Australian Primary Pro-
ducers’ Union and the Victorian Dairy-
farmers’ Association the union, in the
bid for unity, can be considered the
easier to get. A few years ago it was
gaining membership at the expense of
the dairyfarmers, but that trend has been
reversed. It could be expected that as
time went on the two memberships,
which now stand at about 16,000 for
the association and 20,000 for the union,
would converge. But the main reason
why the dairymen can bargain more
strongly than their miscellaneous rivals
is that their association enjoys a range
of affiliations that makes the union look
almost ostracised.
Integrating the four organisations in
Victoria into a single unit will not be
easy. The wheat and woolgrowers in-
sist that they will not yield to the new
concept unless there are ample guaran-
tees of “democratic control.” In their
minds is the contrast between their own
all-important annual conferences and the
fact that the graziers run their affairs
from the top. The APPU has a special
role to play in providing a framework
for the new multi-purpose organisation.
The dairymen also want democracy, but
their association, run largely through
district councils, is not so fanatical about
it as the wheat and woolgrowers.
